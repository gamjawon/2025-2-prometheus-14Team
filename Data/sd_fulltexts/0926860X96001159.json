Reaction products included mainly C5 compounds as well as methylcyclopentene, saturated open chain C6 isomers, C6 alkenes, C5 to C8 cyclic, and aromatic compounds. The reaction is sensitive to catalyst properties, as well as a good probe to evaluate various reactions typical of FCC, like cracking, isomerization and hydrogen transfer, both total catalyst acidity and zeolite unit cell size being necessary to ascertain catalyst performance. The same trends were observed on all the samples. The extension of the reactions following single active site mechanisms (cracking and isomerization) correlated with total catalyst acidity. Reac- tions obeying mechanisms that demand paired active sites (hydrogen transfer) can be accounted for more properly on a zeolite unit cell size basis, Hydrogen transfer decreases significantly at unit cell sizes lower than 24.30 ,~. Lower temperatures favored both isomerization and hydrogen transfer against cracking. The reaction could be used as a test to provide complementary information for commercial catalyst evaluation procedures.

Introduction As one of the most important processes in the petroleum refining industry, the fluidized bed catalytic cracking of gas oils (FCC) has gained continuous concern [1]. Catalyst performance and selection are key factors in the economics of the process, but, due to the very particular commercial reactor-regenerator system and the extreme difficulty in simulating or scaling it down to laboratory sizes, * Tel.: ( + 54-42) 528062; fax: (+ 54-42) 553727; e-mail: usedran@fiqus.unl.edu.ar. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sedran /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 147-158 selection procedures are severely limited and vary widely according to users' criteria and needs [2,3]. Procedures normally do not rank catalysts according to their response to particular reactions or set of reactions, but as a function of overall performance. After the advent of more severe regulations on gasoline composition, the intrinsically important hydrogen transfer reactions occurring in FCC have re- ceived additional interest [2], since they control product quality and catalyst stability [4]. They are normally expressed as the overall reaction between alkenes and naphthenes to produce alkanes and aromatics. Octane catalysts that are based on ultrastable Y zeolites (USY), were developed aimed at controlling to a certain degree the hydrogen transfer reactions consuming alkenes, thus producing a net gain in octanes. However, since these catalysts are dealumi- nated, they have lower concentrations of active sites and are less active than conventional rare earth exchanged (RE) Y catalysts. The conversion of different probe molecules, the behaviors of which are assumed to represent a much greater number of chemically similar compounds [5], has been one of the approaches to study the complex set of reactions occurring in FCC. In the case of hydrogen transfer, both alkenes and naphthenes are potential probe reactants, and a number of test reactions have been tried with low molecular weight reactants: the conversions of cyclohexene [6-8], methyl- cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene [9] did show that somehow they correlated to the physical-chemical properties of dealuminated catalysts. However, one of the main drawbacks in using alkenes is that they are highly reactive at typical FCC temperatures, thus imposing a limitation on their applicability as test molecules for commercial catalysts. Although they are present in significant amounts in typical FCC feedstocks, naphthenic compounds have gained lesser concern than other hydrocarbon types, like alkanes and aromatics, in the study of FCC reactions [10]. Particularly, there are no references about the conversion of methylcyclopentane on FCC catalysts. It is the objective of this paper to report results obtained in the conversion of methylcyclopentane on FCC catalysts, both equilibrated samples (E-CATs) obtained from actual commercial reactors and series of laboratory steam dealu- minated samples, and to study its potentiality as a test to characterize catalyst properties in view of the most important reactions occurring in FCC. 2. Experimental Four samples of commercial rare earth containing zeolite E-CATs obtained from FCC units sampling devices and two series (series A and B, each composed of six samples) of laboratory steam dealuminated commercial cata- lysts were used. E-CAT samples were the following: Octidyne 1160 BR (sample I) and PRE-50AR (sample II) from Engelhard; Octacat (sample III) and Octacat G. de la Puente, U. Sedran /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (19961 147-158 149 AR-2 (sample IV) from Davison Chem. Div., W.R. Grace & Co. Base catalysts for series A and B were Octidyne 1160 BR from Engelhard and HFZ-33 from Houdry, respectively. The catalysts of series A and B were subjected to steaming (100% steam) in a fixed fluid bed at 815 during different hourly time periods, as indicated by the associated number in the samples' designation (refer to Table 1). Catalyst properties are shown in Table 1. Specific surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and zeolite contents were estimated by means of t-plots and Johnson's method [11]. Micropore volumes were calculated following Dubinin and t-plot ap- proaches [12]. Zeolite unit cell sizes (UCS) were determined following the ASTM D-3942-85 method on a Shimadzu XD-1 X-ray diffractometer. Acidity was measured by means of NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD). Catalysts were calcined under flowing air at 500, and NH3 adsorption was performed at 100. Then, loosely adsorbed NH3 was purged under N2 stream during 2 h at 200 and desorption was achieved by increasing tempera- ture at a rate of 10/min up to 500 with N2 flowing at 35 ml/min. NH3 TPD profiles were measured by a thermal conductivity detector. Results were calibrated against chemical titration of desorbed NH3 received in an acidic solution. Activity runs were performed using methylcyclopentane (Fluka, > 99%), without further purification, in a fixed bed reactor at temperatures between 450 Table 1 Catalyst properties.

Sedran / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 147-158 and 510, on catalyst samples previously calcined at 510 under flowing air during 30 min. Reactant partial pressures in the 0.09 to 0.20 atm range were obtained by using nitrogen as a diluent gas. According to the activities of the samples, catalyst to reactant ratios were varied up to 20 g h/mol, thus obtaining conversions below 20%. Reaction products in effluent samples taken after times on stream of 3 min were analyzed by gas chromatography. Initial reaction rates were calculated as the slopes of the curves of conversion to a given product or group of products versus the ratio of catalyst weight to total flow. Experiments were performed to confirm that activity and product distributions kept steady at longer times on stream, and that thermal cracking was negligible under those conditions. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst properties Catalyst properties are summarized in Table 1. Catalyst samples obtained from commercial FCC units showed unit cell sizes in the range of 24.22 to 24.31 ,~ which can be considered standard values for conventional or octane barrel REY catalysts [4]. Observed BET surface areas, rare earth oxide and zeolite contents are also typical of commercial operation [4]. Two facts distinguish base catalyst A-0, which is more recent, from base catalyst B-0: the higher zeolite content and the lower matrix acidity. Note that if total catalyst acidities are expressed in a zeolite basis (meq NH3/g zeolite), these quantities should be equal if zeolite is considered the only contributor to acidity, since UCSs, in turn accounting for the number of framework aluminum atoms, are essentially the same; the higher value for sample B-0 can only be ascribed to non-zeolitic acidity. Catalyst samples subjected to steaming in the laboratory showed decreasing surface areas, meso- (not reported) and micropore volumes and zeolite contents as a function of treatment's severity. As expected for a fixed temperature steaming treatment [13], the longer the time, the more pronounced the variations; however, it can clearly be seen that the rate of change of these properties was the highest at the initial steps. Nevertheless, unit cell sizes in the series samples seemed to level off at different values: approxi- mately 24.22 A for series A and 24.27 A for series B. The lower unit cell size for series A can be explained as a consequence of the lower content of rare earth oxides in the zeolite. Concerning micropore volumes, a property that can be ascribed to the zeolite component of the FCC catalysts, they were calculated by means of Dubinin's approach and t-plot method [12]. Calculations based on Dubinin's approach always yielded micropore volumes higher than those based on the t-plot method. While the development of mesoporosity in Y zeolites is certainly possible in G. de la Puente, U. Sedran / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 147-158 151 extensive dealumination treatments [14,15], it is known that the t-plot method can assign zeolitic mesopore area to matrix area. Our results as calculated by t-plot analysis, shown in Table 1, are in line with published values for Y zeolites [16]. However, comparison among the various samples in a series is still valid. There is a continuous decrease in micropore volume as a function of treatment severity (time period length), which is faster in the initial stages, and that also reflect upon the decrease of the zeolite content. The observed micropore volumes of actual E-CAT samples, except for catalyst IV, average at 0.035 ml/g. All the samples showed the same patterns in their NH3-TPD profiles, characterized by a single wide desorption peak demonstrative of a broad distribution of acid sites, with its maximum located at about 310-330. The amount of acidity expressed by the quantity of ammonia desorbed decreased continuously as a function of treatment severity, with the most pronounced changes observed in the first steps of dealumination (shorter time periods, refer to Table 1). However, significant shifts in the location of the maxima, which would indicate changes in acid strength, were not observed. E-CAT acidities are very low. Laboratory equilibration procedures do not normally consider catalyst acidity as an index of equilibration [2,3], but if it is done in our case, then it can be seen that samples in series A and B steamed during 4 h at 815 would show total acidity values close to those observed in E-CATs (refer to Table 1). 3.2. ActiciO, and selecticity patterns All the catalysts (E-CATs and laboratory dealuminated samples) were active in the conversion of methylcyclopentane at 510. By changing reactant mass flow rate for a given catalyst weight, it was possible to achieve conversions below 20%, so as to follow the selectivity patterns without masking effects from excessive reaction extension or coke formation. A summary of observed product distributions is presented in Table 2 for selected catalysts from series A and B and E-CATs at the same conversion level. Products comprised open chain and cyclic alkanes and alkenes in the C ~-C8 range and aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes); under higher conversion conditions, up to C9 aromatics could be observed. The most important products were observed to be in the C I-C 5 range (refer to Table 2). Individual yield plots (wt.-% vs. conversion) for the different products show that they can be grouped according to their behavior into stable or unstable primary and secondary products. The same patterns for each product or group of products were observed over all the catalyst samples. Some representative examples, on both laboratory dealuminated samples and E-CATs, are shown in Fig. la-c: C5 (five or less carbon atoms per molecule) cracking products are stable primary, cyclohexane is unstable primary and aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes, and their addition) are stable secondary products.

It has to be mentioned that the qualitative behavior of single compounds among products of the conversion of methylcyclopentane over pure Y zeolite [17], in terms of their yield plots, were similar to the ones observed in this work. Though some differences in group yields (e.g. cyclohexane, isomerization product and aromatics) were observed, the comparison is very restricted since catalyst properties cannot be compared on a sound basis. A much higher conversion to aromatic products had been observed in the reaction of methylcy- clopentane on the H-Ce-Y zeolite in the presence of hydrogen [18]. Products derived from methylcyclopentane conversion on this type of cata- lysts can be accounted for by means of surface carbocation chemistry [4,10]. Reactant molecules yielding ions adsorbed on the catalyst surface would be subjected to the following reactions [9]. The ring C-C bond cleavage by protolytic cracking of methylcyclopentane molecules would lead to secondary or tertiary open chain C6 carbocations that G. de la Puente, U. Sedran / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 147-158 153 can be subjected to reactions of [3-scission cracking (leading to C5_ products), isomerization (leading to C6 products) or directly desorb as C6 alkenes (after proton transfer to the catalytic surface) or alkanes (after hydride transfer from a donor molecule). Methylcyclopentyl carbocations are subjected to the same set of reactions. Other processes, like C-H bond cleavage by protolytic cracking are less feasible [9]. Hydride transfer reactions would account for products like methylcyclopen- tene and aromatics. Although there is not complete agreement about the mechanisms explaining hydride transfer in hydrocarbon cracking reactions [2], it is believed that an adsorbed carbenium ion would accept a hydride ion trans- ferred from a nearby, somehow trapped molecule and desorb, while the donor remains adsorbed as a carbocation which in turn might be subjected to the reactions mentioned above. Successive desorptions and hydride donations from the donor molecule would lead it to a relatively dehydrogenated compound (e.g. aromatic); eventually, more condensed products (e.g. coke) could be formed with contributions from this kind of mechanisms. This model implies that paired, closely located active sites in the zeolite surface are needed, a fact on which there is general agreement [2]. On the other hand, the desorption of saturated products can also be accounted for by hydride transfers to adsorbed carbenium ions. Following this reaction pattern, C5 cracking and isomerization products are expected primary, since they would be formed after the appearance of methylcy- clopentyl or hexyl ions on the catalyst surface to be cracked or reordered. This was confirmed by the results shown in Fig. l a and b. Benzene, toluene and xylenes are expected to be secondary products in the reaction scheme, as it was confirmed in our results (refer to Fig. lc), and they would account for what is normally known as intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions, after a number of events. It has to be stressed, however, that aromatic compounds were observed among products even at conversions as low as 3%. Other reaction schemes accounting for the conversion of saturated hydrocarbon molecules on acidic catalysts also show aromatics as secondary products in the kinetic networks [19]. Methylcyclopentene, an unstable primary product, would be the product of a single event of hydride ion transfer and desorption from reactant methylcy- clopentane. According to the small ratio between linear C6 alkenes and alkanes observed, the course of proton transfer from the adsorbed ionic species back to the catalyst surface seems to occur limitedly. This fact had also been observed in C6 ion reactions on USY zeolites in the 400-500 temperature range [20]. The reaction was also carried out at 450 and 480 on sample lI under the same experimental approach aimed at achieving low conversions. Products followed the same patterns. The calculation of the first order kinetic constant for methylcyclopentane conversion at the various thermal levels on E-CAT sample II allowed to estimate an apparent energy of activation of 24.8 kcal/mol, 154 G. de la Puente, U.

These values compare to the wide range of apparent energies of activation for the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight: 15 kcal/mol for methylcyclohexane [21], 19 kcal/mol for heptane and 30 kcal/mol for hexane [22] on the same zeolite catalyst. 3.3. Eualuation of reactions The most important overall reaction proceeding in methylcyclopentane con- version is cracking, as evidenced by the high proportion of C5_ compounds among products. Thus, C5_ products were selected as an index of cracking reactions. Fig. 2 shows the values of the cracking (C5_ products) initial reaction rates as a function of catalyst acidity for all the samples tested; it can be seen that a general correlation prevails (both on E-CATs and laboratory dealuminated samples): as expected, since cracking reactions proceed based on a single site occupancy mechanism, the higher the acidity, the more cracking exists. Fresh samples showed a much higher cracking activity. Methylcyclopentane isomerizes to cyclohexane (a primary unstable product, G. de la Puente, U.

Fig. 3 shows cyclohexane initial reaction rates as a function of total catalyst acidity for all the samples. It can be seen that the activity for isomerization increases directly with total acidity (acid site density). Again, both plant equilibrated and laboratory dealuminated samples followed the same trend, while fresh samples were much more active. Experiments performed on E-CAT sample II at different temperatures allowed to confirm that isomerization reactions are favored against cracking at lower temperatures; for example, selectivity values (S_IS), defined as the ratio between initial reaction rates for isomerization and cracking, were the following: 0.19 at 450, 0.11 at 480 and 0.02 at 510. 0.80 0.40 ~\" O.lO GO I O.05 o iv 0.00 F L 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.40 0.60 Acidify (meqNH3 / g) Fig. 3. lsomerization initial reaction rates as a function of catalyst acidity at 510.

It has to be considered that catalytic contributions from both extraframework aluminum species originated by steaming, the role of which is still to be elucidated [23,24], and acidic matrices, are to be expected in addition to that of the zeolitic component. Thus, the lower slopes of the relationships observed in the low acidity range could be assigned to an inferior specific catalytic contribution from non-zeolitic materials, since they are present in those samples in higher relative amounts than in more acidic (less dealuminated) ones. It is accepted in FCC catalysts that the most important contribution to catalyst acidity, and conse- quently activity, is that from the zeolite component. However, if initial cracking or isomerization reaction rates are compared against zeolite UCS, which is a direct measure of the number of aluminum atoms per unit cell, in turn associated to zeolitic acid sites, a definite trend is not observed. Considering total catalyst acidity as the governing property with regard to cracking and isomerization reactions would take into account all contributing sources: zeolite component (framework aluminum atoms and even RE ion hydrolysis), matrix component and extraframework aluminum species. The activity of chemically and hy- drothermally dealuminated Y zeolites in the conversion of n-hexadecane has also been observed to depend on the total aluminum content [23]. As discussed above, aromatic product yields were selected to express hydro- gen transfer reactions, since they appear as secondary products in the reaction network as a consequence of donor cyclic molecules subjected to a number of events of hydride transfer-adsorption-desorption. If the initial reaction rates for aromatic compound production are represented as a function of total acidity (representative of total amount of acid sites), a clear correlation is not observed. As described previously, proposed hydrogen transfer reaction mechanisms would involve two closely located active sites, thus being sensitive to acid site density, related to paired sites. Fig. 4 shows the relation between hydrogen transfer G. de la Puente, U. Sedran / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 147-158 157 selectivity S HT (defined as the ratio between initial rates for hydrogen transfer and cracking) and zeolite unit cell size as observed on all the samples tested; it can be seen that the lower the unit cell size, the less the hydrogen transfer, with a steeper decrease at UCS lower than about 24.30 A. This observation is in line with previous reports about the conversion of model reactants on pure zeolite or compound catalysts [6,7], and has also been associated to corresponding varia- tions in the research octane numbers of gasoline in gas oil FCC [8]. The limiting value of 24.30 A is consistent with theoretical model predictions [25] that account for a strong reduction in the number of paired aluminum sites when UCS is smaller. Experiments performed on sample II showed that the lower the temperature, the higher the S HT, its values being 0.40 at 450, 0.25 at 480 and 0.18 at 510. 4. Conclusions Steam dealumination of commercial REY FCC catalysts induces strong changes in their properties. If catalyst acidity is considered in addition to UCS variations, 100% steam during 4 h at 815 produces samples with properties close to those of the actual E-CAT values. The conversion of methylcyclopentane at temperatures close to those of commercial FCC follows the same path over samples of catalysts equilibrated in actual plants and steam dealuminated in the laboratory. Product distributions can be accounted for by means of carbocation chemistry and they allow to correlate the sample ability to catalyze particular reactions like cracking, isomerization and hydrogen transfer as a function of their properties. Cracking and isomeriza- tion depend on the total amount of acid sites, while hydrogen transfer is sensitive to the zeolitic character of the catalysts, as expressed by the unit cell sizes. As well, isomerization and hydrogen transfer are selectively favored against cracking at lower temperatures. Methylcyclopentane conversion could provide complementary information for commercial catalyst evaluation procedures.

Reaction products included mainly C5− compounds as well as methylcyclopentene, saturated open chain C6 isomers, C6 alkenes, C5 to C8 cyclic, and aromatic compounds. The reaction is sensitive to catalyst properties, as well as a good probe to evaluate various reactions typical of FCC, like cracking, isomerization and hydrogen transfer, both total catalyst acidity and zeolite unit cell size being necessary to ascertain catalyst performance. The same trends were observed on all the samples. The extension of the reactions following single active site mechanisms (cracking and isomerization) correlated with total catalyst acidity. Reactions obeying mechanisms that demand paired active sites (hydrogen transfer) can be accounted for more properly on a zeolite unit cell size basis. Hydrogen transfer decreases significantly at unit cell sizes lower than 24.30Å. Lower temperatures favored both isomerization and hydrogen transfer against cracking. The reaction could be used as a test to provide complementary information for commercial catalyst evaluation procedures.
