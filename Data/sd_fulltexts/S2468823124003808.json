The development of water splitting catalysts for generating high-purity hydrogen in large-scale is still facing challenges in terms of improving efficiency and stability. Herein, Ni3S2-coated NiFe layered double hydroxides sub-nanosheets with a hierarchical heterostructure (NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2) were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a strategy of continuous hydrothermal synthesis. The introduction of S2− broke the hydrogen bonds between NiFe-LDH layers and separated into sub-nanosheets with a thickness of only about 1 nm, which enlarged the active areas of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF by a factor of 5.7. The coexisting charge channels Ni-O-Ni and Ni-S-Ni in the material enhanced the electrochemical activity, resulting in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials as low as 179 mV and 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, after a 50-hour chronopotentiometry test at 50 mA cm−2, the overpotential for OER and HER decreased only 0.013 V and 0.059 V, respectively. Furthermore, under the conditions of simulating industrial hydrogen production with an electrolyte of 6.0 M KOH and a temperature of 75 °C, after a 140-hour test for durability, the current density decreased only 0.75% at the cell voltage of 1.70 V.

Hydrogen energy, as the name suggests, is a form of energy fueled by hydrogen and is considered as a promising alternative to fossil energy because of its high energy density, low carbon emission and less pollution [4]. At present, hydrogen can be produced mainly by water electrolysis, PEM electrolysis, water photolysis, natural gas reforming and pressure swing adsorption in industry. Among them, water electrolysis is suitable for generating high-purity hydrogen in large-scale on account of its low cost and mature technology [5–7]. The water splitting process includes two electrode reactions in an electrolytic cell, namely the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode [8,9]. Usually, the actual cell voltage of water splitting is much higher than the theoretical value of 1.23 V due to the polarization of the two electrodes [10]. Researchers are devoted to develop many kinds of catalysts to reduce the cell voltage for reducing energy consumption caused by the polarization. So far, Pt-based and Ir/Ru-based materials are known as the best electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively [11]. But the applications of the noble metal-based materials are limited in industry production on account of their low reserve and high cost [12–14]. In recent years, transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and their oxides [15], hydroxides [16], sulfides [17], phosphides [18] have been widely investigated as alternatives to the noble metal-based catalysts. Among them, the sulfides have attracted more attention because of their outstanding electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. Jin et al. [19] reported a Ni3S2 electrocatalyst synthesized on a graphene-modified nickel foam substrate, which exhibited a low HER overpotential of 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution. Zhang et al. [20]. designed a method for growing Ni3S2 in FeNi3 foam that reduced the HER and OER overpotentials to 105 mV and 213 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. At the same time, the research of hydroxides, especially nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDH), has also been launched gradually, such as NiFe-LDH [21,22], CoNi-LDH [23], CoFe-LDH [24]. The results suggested that part of the nickel in the LDH existed in the form of γ-NiOOH. The Ni-O-Ni charge transport channels in the oxyhydroxide were favorable to catalyzing OER [25,26]. But the performance of NiFe-LDH on catalyzing HER is usually not satisfactory [27,28]. In terms of electrocatalyzing HER, sulfides were usually prominent [29,30]. As a result, transition metal sulfides and LDH composites were further fabricated into heterostructure composites in order to optimize the electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER simultaneously [31]. Li et al. [32] prepared NiFe-LDH on MoS2 nanosheets by an electrodeposition method, and its overpotentials for HER and OER were 98 mV and 257 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Yang et al. [33] constructed heterostructure NiFe-LDH@CoS x , which exhibited the HER and OER overpotentials as low as 136 mV and 206 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Undoubtedly, great progress has been made in the research of alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts for HER and OER. However, due to the need for greater efficiency and stability to adapt to industrial applications, we are still facing challenges in developing un-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for HER and OER, as well as bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. Herein, we synthesized Ni3S2-coated NiFe-LDH sub-nanosheets on nickel foam (NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF) through a continuous hydrothermal self-assembly method. The as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF should be a hierarchical heterostructure material, and is supposed to be able to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER ascribed as following: (1) The γ-NiOOH existing in NiFe-LDH has been considered to be the foundation of Ni-O-Ni charge transport channels and contributes to enhance OER performance. (2) S2− in Ni3S2 can partly replace OH− on the surface of NiFe-LDH, which could break the hydrogen bond between the layers of the LDH, and separate the layers from each other to form ultra-thin sheets with a hierarchical heterostructure. The structure is supposed to be able to increase the active areas of the as-synthesized material and thus expose more electrocatalytic active sites; (3) After the substitution of S2− for OH−, Fe on the surface of NiFe-LDH would connect to S2− instead of OH−. The formed Fe-S bond is supposed to be conducive to the hydrogen reduction in hydrogen-containing species, because the ability of both Fe and S to attract electrons is weaker than Ni and O, respectively; (4) The synthesized NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 is grown directly on NF by chemical self-assembly, which may result in a strong interaction between the material and NF to prevent the electrode active substance from falling off the substrate [28,34]. According to the above analysis, the prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF is expected to show an excellent performance for overall water splitting under simulated conditions of industrial hydrogen production. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O], iron nitrate nonahydrate [Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O], urea [CO(NH2)2], potassium hydroxide (KOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), acetone (CH3COCH3), ethanol (C2H5OH), ammonium fluoride (NH4F) were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The details are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI). Nickel foam (NF) pieces (1.0 cm × 1.5 cm) should be pre-treated as follows before used: ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, 1.0 M HCl, ethanol, and deionized water in turn, and then dried at room temperature. 2.2 Synthesis of NiFe-LDH/NF 1.570 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.730 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (corresponding to the Ni:Fe molar ratio of 1:3) were dissolved in 6 mL deionized water in a beaker. 0.052 g NH4F and 0.203 g CO(NH2)2 were solved into 12 mL deionized water in another beaker. After that, the two solutions were mixed under stirring until becoming homogeneous mixture. Then put the mixture into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel hydrothermal reactor of 100 mL with the NF pieces (prepared as above) fixed in advance. The reactor was then sealed and kept in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the reactor was taken out and cooled down to room temperature. The solid product, namely nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH), should deposit on the surface of the NF pieces. Then the NF pieces were carefully fetched out and washed with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in turn for three times, after that, kept in a drying oven at 60 °C for 5 h. The NF pieces that the surfaces have been covered by yellow NiFe-LDH are simply expressed as NiFe-LDH/NF. For comparison purpose, the NiFe-LDH was also prepared under the same conditions as the above except the Ni:Fe molar ratio, which was changed to 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. 2.3 Preparation of NiFe-LDH@Ni3s2/NF 0.080 g Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O and 0.100 g CS(NH2)2 (corresponding to the Ni:S mole ratio of 1:4.8) were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and then put into a hydrothermal reactor with the NiFe-LDH/NF pieces (prepared in Section 2.2 with the Ni:Fe mole ratio of 1:3) fixed in advance. The next hydrothermal reaction and post-treatment steps were the same as the corresponding steps described in Section 2.2. The NF pieces that the surfaces have been covered by light green NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 are simply expressed as NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, and Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesizing steps. For comparison purpose, the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 was also prepared under the same conditions as the above except the Ni:S molar ratio, which was changed to 1:1.2, 1:2.4 and 1:7.2, respectively. Ni3S2/NF electrodes were also prepared in this work. The preparation method was the same as that for NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, except that the NiFe-LDH/NF was replaced by a NF electrode. In addition, electrodeposition methods were also employed to prepare electrodes for comparison. A typical preparation of a NiFe-LDH/NF electrode was carried out in a three-electrode system, a NF piece (1.0 cm × 1.5 cm), a graphite rod electrode and an Ag|AgCl electrode served as the working electrode, the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was a mixture of 0.15 M Ni(NO3)2 and 0.15 M Fe(NO3)3, the working potential was −1.0 V, and the depositing time is 200 s. NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF was prepared by the same method as that for NiFe-LDH/NF, except that the NiFe-LDH/NF was the working electrode instead of the NF, and the electrolyte was the mixture of 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2 and 0.05 M CS(NH2)2. 2.4 Characteristics Morphology and structure of the as-fabricated materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. The characteristic methods and instruments are shown in Table S2. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests were performed in a three-electrode system connected with an electrochemical working station. One of the prepared electrodes, a graphite rod electrode and a Hg|HgO electrode served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH unless otherwise stated. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were tested at a scanning rate of 5 mV s− 1 without IR compensation. Tafel slopes were converted from the LSV curves. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) were carried out at the open circuit potential of the tested system in the frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.01 Hz. Double layer capacitance (C dl) were calculated according to cyclic voltammetry curves (CV), which were measured in the voltage range of 0.88 to 0.98 V at different scanning rate from 20 to 120 mV s− 1. Δj 1/2 values were obtained by the cathode and anode current density (j a and j c) at the open circuit potential on the CV curves, which equals (j a - j c)/2. By plotting the relationship between Δj 1/2 and the CV scanning rates, a straight line can be obtained, and its slope value is C dl. The chronopotentiometry (CP) curves were tested for 50 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. Current-time curves was tested for evaluating the stability of water splitting. All the potentials reported in this work were converted to standard hydrogen electrode potentials (vs. RHE). Faraday efficiencies of HER and OER were tested by drainage method [35] and rotating disk electrode (RRDE) [14], respectively. The details about the preparation of RRDE and the calculation method of Faraday efficiency are shown in Section 3 in the SI. Current-time curve of the as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF electrodes was tested for 140 h in a two-electrode system under a cell voltage of 1.70 V in 6.0 M KOH at 75 °C for simulating industrial applications. All the electrochemical testing methods and instruments are shown in Table S2. 3 Results and discussions SEM images can exhibit the morphologies of NiFe-LDH before and after modified with Ni3S2. Fig. 1 a shows that, before modified with Ni3S2, NiFe-LDH exhibits a flower-like hierarchical structure with a diameter of several microns composed of thick nanosheets. TEM test result shows that the layers of NiFe-LDH are heavily stacked and of uneven in thickness (Fig. S1a). Fig. S1b shows that the local thickness is about 5 nm. After modified with Ni3S2, the hierarchical structure is still maintained, as shown in Fig. 1b, but the thickness of the nanosheets is reduced significantly. The TEM image (Fig. 1c) shows that NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 consists of a large number of sub-nanosheets, and Fig. 1d shows that the thickness is about 1 nm. The results indicate that the stacking layers are separated during the modification of Ni3S2. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mappings of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 (Fig. 1e) confirm the coexisting Ni, Fe, O and S. The ICP-MS results (Table S3) show the contents of Ni, Fe and S are 46.9%, 10.3% and 7.3%, respectively. XRD patterns of NiFe-LDH, Ni3S2 and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 were displayed in Fig. 1f. On the XRD pattern of NiFe-LDH, the peaks at 11.5°, 23°, 34.5°, 39° and 46° respectively correspond with the diffraction of (003), (006), (012), (015), and (018) crystal planes of the LDH (JCPDS No. 40–0215) [36]. But the (001) crystal plane of Ni(OH)2 around 19.3° is not clear, indicating that the plan should be masked by other species during the preparation process, which can be further confirmed by the XPS results as following. On the XRD pattern of Ni3S2, the peaks at 22°, 31°, 37.8°, 50° and 55.3° respectively correspond to the diffraction of (101), (110), (021), (211), and (300) planes (JCPDS NO. 44–1418) [37]. All diffraction peaks of the as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 powder are in agreement with those of NiFe-LDH and Ni3S2. The HRTEM image of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 (Fig. 1g) reveals two lattice fringes of 0.207 nm and 0.232 nm, corresponding to the (018) and (021) crystal planes of NiFe-LDH and Ni3S2, respectively. The SAED images of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 (Fig. 1h) shows the diffractions of (018) and (300) crystal planes of NiFe-LDH and Ni3S2, respectively. The HRTEM and SAED images are consistent with the XRD patterns of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2. The results prove that the hierarchical heterostructure NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF sub-nanosheets have been successfully prepared. XPS technique is used for exploring the compositions and valence states of the as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2. The total spectra of both NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 and NiFe-LDH (Fig. S2) show the presence of elements O, Ni and Fe. Besides, there is an insignificant sulfur peak on the total spectra of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2. The compositions are consistent with the EDX spectra of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 shown in Fig. 1e. The XPS of Ni 2p, Fe 2p, O 1s and S 2p of the two materials are shown in Fig. 2 . Ni 2p spectrum of NiFe-LDH (Fig. 2a) is in accord with two spin orbit doublets of Ni2+ and Ni3+, and two satellites. The peaks at 855.2 and 872.9 eV are indexed to Ni2+. The peaks at 856.2 and 874.8 eV are indexed to Ni3+, indicating the presence of γ-NiOOH, which is considered to be the active species and represents the intrinsic catalytic activity for OER [26]. Obviously, Ni 2p spectrum of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 is consistent with that of NiFe-LDH, but the Ni3+ peak shifts 0.33 eV to the right, suggesting the introduction of S2 − reduces the electron binding energy of Ni3+, and which should be beneficial for improving the performance of the material for HER. Fe 2p spectrum of NiFe-LDH (Fig. 2b) shows a 2p3/2 orbital of Fe3+ at 711.7 eV, a 2p1/2 orbital of Fe2+ at 725.0 eV (Fe), and a satellite peak at 715.1 eV. Meanwhile, the peak at 706.7 eV indicates that Fe is not in its normal valence state. Fe 2p spectrum of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 is consistent with that of NiFe-LDH, but a decreasing relative peak strength of Fe3+ and Fe2+, and an increasing relative strength of the satellite at 706.7 eV, which indicates that part of Fe3+ and Fe2+ are converted to the abnormal valence state when the NiFe-LDH laminates are separated during the modification with Ni3S2 as shown in Fig. 1a and b [38,39]. The results demonstrate that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Fe. S 2p spectrum of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 (Fig. 2c) shows the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbital of S2− at 163.5 eV and 162.3 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of Ni3S2. The characteristic peak of SO4 2− at 168.5 eV indicates that part of Fe and Ni exist in the form of sulfate [40,41]. O 1s spectra of both NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 (Fig. 2d) show a M-OH peak at 530.9 eV, representing hydroxide as the dominant species and most of them should be Ni(OH)2, which agrees with the ICP-MS results as shown in Table S3. Meanwhile there is a -OOH peak at 531.9 eV corresponding to NiOOH, which is considered to be able to interact with Fe and significantly enhance the charge transfer after doped with iron [14,30], therefore beneficial for improving OER performance [42–45]. The O 1s spectra suggests that there are Ni-O-Ni electron channels in the materials. Besides, there are a M-O peak at 529.0 eV and a H2O peak at 533.3 eV [46–48]. By comparison with the O 1s spectrum of NiFe-LDH, the relative peak intensity of M-OH of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 decreases obviously, suggesting that some OH− ions are replaced by S2− [30], and thus forming new Ni-S-Ni electron channels. In the new channels, the bounding ability of S to the outer shell electrons is weaker than that of O in Ni-O-Ni channels, therefore the introduction of S is conducive to the hydrogen in H donors to gain electrons, and accordingly promoting HER. In addition, in catalyzing HER, the nickel in Ni3S2 will preferentially obtain the electrons from the electrode and convert to Ni0, which represents the intrinsic catalytic activity for HER [49]. Meanwhile, the doped Fe atoms connected with the S atoms can increase the electron cloud density around the S and consequently decrease their binding energy, which should be helpful increasing the charge density of the Ni-S-Ni channel, therefore optimize the adsorption of H on Ni3S2 [30] and improve the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 for HER. The XPS results demonstrate that the two kinds of charge channels Ni-O-Ni and Ni-S-Ni coexist in the hierarchical heterostructure sub-nanosheets, and meanwhile suggests that there is an obvious influence of the doped Fe on the charge density around Ni. The synergy among the compositions should be essential for NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 to present bifunctional catalysis for OER and HER. LSV, Tafel plots, CV and EIS were employed to evaluate the electrocatalysis of the as-synthesized electrodes, as well as a NF electrode for comparison purposes. LSV curves of NiFe-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF prepared with different mole ratio of Ni:Fe or Ni:S for OER are shown in Fig. S3 and S4, respectively. The results indicate that the as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF shows the best OER performance when the ratio of Ni:Fe and Ni:S are 1:3 and 1:4.8, respectively, under the researched conditions. Therefore, the electrodes prepared with these reagent proportions will be used in subsequent discussions unless otherwise specified. LSV curves of NF and Ni3S2/NF, NiFe-LDH/NF, NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF (Fig. 3 a) show different electrochemical behaviors for OER. There is an oxidation peak on the curves of Ni3S2/NF and NF, which represents the oxidation of nickel. On the LSV curves of NiFe-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, the oxidation peak almost disappears, indicating that the modification of NiFe-LDH for the surface of NF is necessary for improving the stability of the electrodes. In addition, when the current density is higher than 10 mA cm−2, the corresponding potentials of NiFe-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER at a same current density are much lower than those of Ni3S2/NF and NF. For comparison, herein, η is named overpotential, which equals to the potential value on a LSV curve minus the theoretical electrode potential 1.23 V of OER. Fig. 3b shows the overpotentials η 10 and η 50 of the four electrodes at 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2 on Fig. 3a, respectively. Obviously, the η 10 and η 50 of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF are only 179 mV and 266 mV, respectively, both of the values are undoubtedly the lowest among the four electrodes. In particular, the two values are lower than those of NiFe-LDH/NF, indicating that the modification of NiFe-LDH by Ni3S2 can significantly reduce the overpotentials for OER. The preparation method of the working electrodes also significantly affects the test results for OER. Fig. S5 shows the LSV curves of the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF electrodes prepared by the chemical self-assembled method described in Section 2.3 and an electrodeposition method described aslo in Section 2.3, respectively. Obviously, the chemical self-assembled electrode shows much lower overpotential and stability for OER. We consider which is related to the growth process of the electrode material on the substrate. The electric field force in the electrodeposition belongs to an external action, which can accelerate the deposition and growth of the active species. But at the same time, it is very likely to lead to a large number of structural defects, and weakens the interaction between the active substance and the substrate, thus reducing its performance for OER. Therefore, the electrodes prepared by the chemical self-assembled method is generally used in the related discussions unless otherwise specified. Table S4 summarize the overpotentials of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF and some reported electrocatalysts for OER in 1.0 M KOH. In comparison, NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF shows a distinctly low OER overpotential. Tafel plots were employed to investigate the OER kinetic of the fabricated electrodes further. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Tafel slope of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF is only 106 mV dec−1, which is lower than 114 mV dec−1, 222 mV dec−1 and 233 mV dec−1 of NiFe-LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF and NF, respectively, suggesting a high charge-transfer rate of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER. The Faraday efficiency of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER can be further calculated by the tested current values of RRDE shown in Fig. S6, and the result exhibits that the efficiency can be up to 98%. We consider that the excellent performance for catalyzing OER can be attributed to the abundant active sites and electron channels in the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 with hierarchical heterostructure. The stability and the electrocatalytic mechanism of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 have been studied by various methods, including XRD, TEM and XPS of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 after the LSV test for OER, as well as multiple-cycle CV and CP. The XRD pattern (Fig. S7) exhibits a similar diffraction peak distribution of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 before and after LSV test for OER. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern after the OER test shows a weak diffraction peak at 19.3° corresponding to the (001) face of Ni(OH)2 [JCPDS NO. 03–0177] [50], suggesting that some of the crystal plans were exposed during the OER on account of a partial stripping of the covering species. The TEM image (Fig. S8) shows that the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 remains in good morphology after the test. The XPS spectra (Fig. S9) demonstrate that NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 still remains its composition but a partial loss of sulfur-containing and iron-containing species on the electrode surface after the LSV test for OER. The partial loss of the iron-containing species probably results the exposure of Ni(OH)2 deep in the material, therefore the (001) plane diffraction of Ni(OH)2 appears on its XRD pattern (Fig. S7). The results also suggests that the iron hydroxide deposits preferentially on the (001) plane of Ni(OH)2 during the chemical self-assembling process of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2. In addition, the O 1s spectrum shows that the peak of active species NiOOH is almost unchanged before and after the OER, indicating an excellent electrocatalytic stability. The stability of NiFe LDH@Ni3S2/NF were also investigated by CV and CP. Fig. S10 shows the LSV curves of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER before and after a 2000-cycle CV test in 1.0 M KOH. Obviously, after the 2000-cycle experiment, the LSV curve (Fig. S10) shows a pretty little variation than the initial one. The CP curves of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER under 10 and 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3d) also show that, after 50 h, the potentials reduce only 0.003 V and 0.013 V, respectively. The results demonstrate that the direct growth of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 on NF by chemical self-assembly can effectively prevent the electrode active substance from falling off the substrate, thus giving the as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF excellent cycling stability and durability. Based on CV curves in non-Faradaic regions (Fig. S11), the electrochemical active areas of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, NiFe-LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF and NF are compared by means of double layer capacitance values (C dl) calculated according to the method described in Section 2.5. As shown in Fig. 3e, the C dl of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF is 8.91 mF cm–2, which is 5.7 and 2.0 times the values of NiFe-LDH/NF (1.56 mF cm–2) and Ni3S2/NF (4.51 mF cm–2), respectively. The significant high C dl suggests that the sub-nanosheet structure brings the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF a larger active area, and helps expose more active sites also. Furthermore, based on the EIS experimental results (Fig. 3f), Nyquist plot of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF shows the smallest semicircular diameter among those of the four electrodes, and thus corresponding with the smallest charge transfer resistance, which is about 6.20 Ω. The data demonstrate that the ultra-thin nanoflake layer structure formed by the optimization of Ni3S2 not only increases the electrochemically active area, but also improves the conductivity, therefore enhances the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER efficiently. The performance of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for HER was also evaluated by the same methods as for OER. LSV curves for HER were tested for investing the influence of the mole ratio of Ni:Fe and Ni:S, respectively. Fig. S12 and S13 show that the prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF presents the best HER performance when the mole ratio of Ni:Fe is 1:3, and the mole ratio of Ni:S is 1:4.8, respectively, which agree with the testing results for OER. Fig. 4 a shows that the HER overpotentials decrease in the order of NF, Ni3S2/NF, NiFe-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 at a same current. Further, Fig. 4b shows that the η 10 of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF is only 116 mV, which is significantly lower than the 144 mV, 174 mV and 214 mV of NiFe-LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF and NF. The values of η 50 show a similar trend to that of η 10. In Table S5, we sum up the overpotentials of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF and some reported electrocatalysts for HER in 1.0 M KOH. In comparison, NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF exhibits a low overpotential for HER also. Tafel plots (Fig. 4c) reveals that the Tafel slope of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF is only 92 mV dec−1, which is the smallest one among the four slopes. Further, Fig. S14 shows the tested Faraday efficiency of CP for HER. According to the results, the average Faraday efficiency of the prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for HER can be calculated, which is 95%. Meanwhile, the calculated results of TOF (Fig. S15) presents a distinct advantage over the NiFe-LDH/NF and Ni3S2/NF, suggesting the best intrinsic activity of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for HER. The results suggest that the modification of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF by Ni3S2 has a positive effect on charge transfer during the electrode process. The formation of Ni-S-Ni channels, confirmed by the XPS result, contributes to constructing an efficient electron path during HER process. Further, the XRD pattern (Fig. S16) of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 after the LSV test shows a similar diffraction peak distribution but the peak intensity of Ni3S2 decrease lightly. Meanwhile, the TEM image (Fig. S17) after the HER process reveals that the morphology of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 has hardly changed. The stability of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF was evaluated by CV and CP, too. After a 2000-cycle CV test in 1.0 M KOH, the LSV curve of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF (Fig. S18) for HER is similar to the initial one, except for a slight increase in potential. Moreover, Fig. 4d shows that, after a 50 h CP test at 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2 for HER, respectively, the potentials reduce only 0.003 V and 0.059 V. The results demonstrate that the as-fabricated NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF has an excellent cycling stability and durability for HER. Inspired by the outstanding OER and HER performance of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, a two-electrode cell, as illustrated in Fig. 5 a, was designed to evaluate its electrocatalysis for overall water splitting. In the system, the same two as-prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF electrodes were employed as the cathode and the anode, expressed as NF|NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2||NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2|NF. For comparison, NF|NiFe-LDH||NiFe-LDH|NF, NF|Ni3S2||Ni3S2|NF and NF||NF, were fabricated also. Fig. 5b exhibits the LSV curves of the four cells in 1.0 M KOH. It can be known from Fig. 5b that the curves of the three cells respectively composited of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF, NiFe-LDH/NF and NF exhibit excellent stability, except that the curve of Ni3S2/NF system shows an oxidation peak around 1.8 V, which demonstrates that direct deposition of Ni3S2 on NF surface conditions cannot improve the electrochemical stability of the material. Further analysis reveals that the cell voltages of the four systems decrease in the order of NF, Ni3S2/NF, NiFe-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 under a same current, and which are 1.61 V, 1.67 V, 1.70 V and 1.84 V at 10 mA cm−2 in turn. In Table S6, we sum up the cell voltages of the two-electrode system composed with NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF and some reported electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH. In comparison, the cell voltage of the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF system is slightly below the reported values. The results indicate that the synergistic optimization of NiFe-LDH and Ni3S2 plays an important role in improving the performance of the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 sub-nanosheets with hierarchical heterostructure for overall water splitting. In order to further explore an applicability, the LSV curve and current-time curve of NF|NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2||NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2|NF were tested under simulated industrial production conditions. As shown in Fig. S19, in 6.0 M KOH, the current density is 56 mA cm−2 at 1.70 V at room temperature. When the testing temperature rises up to 75 °C, as shown in Fig. 5c, the current density can reach up to 258 mA cm−2 at 1.70 V in 6.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the current-time curve of the two-electrode cell was measured in 6.0 M KOH at 75 °C for up to 140 h, and the result is shown in Fig. 5d. As expected, its current density decreased by only 0.75% over a period of near six days. The SEM image (Fig. S20) shows that the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 maintains intact of structure after 140 h stability test. The XPS (Fig. S21) show that after the test of 140 h, the element composition of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 does not change, and the relative content of sulfur slightly decreases also, which agree with the XPS result of the electrode after the LSV experiment for OER (Fig. S9), suggesting that the loss of sulfur is weakly correlated with the test time and the other test conditions considered here. The results demonstrate that the prepared NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF has great application potential in hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolysis. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a novel NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 sub-1 nm nanosheets by a simple continuous hydrothermal method. The Ni-O-Ni channels in NiFe-LDH are essential to promote OER. Meanwhile, the substitution of S2− for a part of OH− on the surface of NiFe-LDH appears an important effect on the structure and properties of the hierarchical heterostructure material. First, the introduction of S2− separated the layers from each other by breaking the hydrogen bond between the LDH layers, which enlarged the active areas of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 by a factor of 5.7 and thus exposed more electrocatalytic active sites. Second, after the substitution, the formed Fe-S bonds were conducive to HER on account of their weaker attraction to electron than Ni and O. Third, two electron-transport channels, Ni-O-Ni and Ni-S-Ni, coexist in the hierarchical heterogeneous material, which improved the electrocatalysis of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for both OER and HER, and reduce their overpotential to 179 mV and 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 was prepared on nickel foam by a chemical self-assembly method, which laid the foundation for enhancing its cycling stability and durability for OER and HER. After a 2000-cycle CV test in 1.0 M KOH, the LSV curves of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF for OER and HER were consistent with their respective initial curves, except for a slight increase in potential. And after a 50 h CP test at 50 mA cm−2 for OER and HER, the potential decreased only 0.013 V and 0.059 V, respectively. Remarkably, under simulated industrial conditions for alkaline water electrolysis hydrogen production (i.e. in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte and at the temperature of 75 °C), the NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF also exhibits an outstanding stability and durability. Under the conditions, a current density of 400 mA cm−2 can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.74 V. Further, after a 140 h test for durability, the current density decreased only 0.75% under the cell voltage of 1.70 V. The results demonstrate that the synthesis strategy of the bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting is effective for expanding the potential applications of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF in green hydrogen industry.

        "dc:description": "The development of water splitting catalysts for generating high-purity hydrogen in large-scale is still facing challenges in terms of improving efficiency and stability. Herein, Ni3S2-coated NiFe layered double hydroxides sub-nanosheets with a hierarchical heterostructure (NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2) were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a strategy of continuous hydrothermal synthesis. The introduction of S2− broke the hydrogen bonds between NiFe-LDH layers and separated into sub-nanosheets with a thickness of only about 1 nm, which enlarged the active areas of NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2/NF by a factor of 5.7. The coexisting charge channels Ni-O-Ni and Ni-S-Ni in the material enhanced the electrochemical activity, resulting in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials as low as 179 mV and 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, after a 50-hour chronopotentiometry test at 50 mA cm−2, the overpotential for OER and HER decreased only 0.013 V and 0.059 V, respectively. Furthermore, under the conditions of simulating industrial hydrogen production with an electrolyte of 6.0 M KOH and a temperature of 75 °C, after a 140-hour test for durability, the current density decreased only 0.75% at the cell voltage of 1.70 V.",
