Bluhm ∗ Cristina Folli Manfred Döring Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institute for Technical Chemistry (ITC-CPV), P.O. Box 3640, 76021 Karlsruhe, Germany * Corresponding author. Tel.: +49-7247-82-2383; fax: +49-7247-82-2244. New iron-based bis(imino)pyridine complexes 6, 7 and the acetyliminopyridine complex 8a are active catalysts together with the co-catalyst MAO for the oligomerization of ethylene. The influence of electron donating methoxy- and electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl-groups attached to the imino phenyl substituents is tested in the catalysis. New iron-based bis(imino)pyridine complexes 6, 7 and the acetyliminopyridine complex 8a are active catalysts together with the co-catalyst MAO for the oligomerization of ethylene. The ligands 1–4 with electron donating methoxy- and electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl-substituents react with FeCl2(thf)2 to the Fe(II) complexes 6–8a. Especially p-methoxy substituents in 6b increase the selectivity in the production of α-olefins. The distribution of oligomers obtained in the catalyzed ethylene oligomerization with 5–8a follows Schulz–Flory rules for oligomers >C4. The probability of chain propagation α is increased by lowering the reaction temperature, while higher pressure of the ethylene gas in the reaction has nearly no effect on the α-values. Keywords Oligomerization Single-site catalysts Ethylene Bis(imino)pyridines Acetylimino-pyridines 1 Introduction The oligomerization of ethylene is one of the major industrial processes for the production of linear α-olefins [1–3]. Those oligomers in the range C6–C20 are used as comonomers in the polymerization of ethylene to give linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or for the preparation of detergents and synthetic lubricants. Catalysts currently used in industry for the shell higher olefin process (SHOP) [4–8] contain Ni(II) complexes bearing bidentate monoanionic ligands [1–8]. Also cationic Ni(II) α-diimine complexes were reported to be effective ethylene oligomerization catalysts [9], while iron-based bis(imino)pyridine catalysts were described as highly active compounds in the oligomerization of ethylene in combination with the co-catalyst MAO or MMAO [10–14]. Several modifications of the bis(imino)pyridine backbone are already described in the literature [15] which mostly lead to a decrease of catalytic activity. Recently fluoro-substituted bis(imino)pyridine complexes and their catalytic reactivity in ethylene oligomerizations were described [16]. We investigated the influence of electron donating methoxy- and electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl-groups attached to the imino phenyl substituents. We thus describe the synthesis of the bis(imino)pyridine ligands 1, 2 and acetyliminopyridine ligand 3a which react with FeCl2(thf)2 [17] to the ferric complexes 6–8a. Additionally, the results of the catalytic oligomerization of ethylene with the precatalysts 6–8a together with MAO as co-catalyst will be presented. 2 Experimental All manipulations were carried out under an atmosphere of argon using standard Schlenk techniques. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer 250MHz ( 1 H ) and 62.9MHz ( 13 C ) at 293K. Mass spectra were obtained using electron ionisation (EI), electron spray ionisation (ESI) or field ionisation (FI). Oligomer products were analysed by GC with a flame ionisation detector, using a 50m DB1 column, injector temperature 40°C and the following temperature program: 40°C/5min, 40–300°C, 5°C/10min−1. The individual products were integrated, using n-tridecane as internal standard. Materials: 2,6-bis[1-(phenylimino)ethyl]pyridine [18] was prepared according to the literature. MAO (10% solution in toluene) and all other anilines were purchased commercially and used as received. 2.1 Synthesis of ligands 2,6-Bis[1-(3-methoxyphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine (1a) [19]: 2,6-diacetylpyridine (0.74g, 4.5mmol) was stirred with m-anisidine (1.83g, 15mmol, 3.3eq) in 20ml of dry benzene at ambient temperature in the presence of 8.5g of molecular sieves. The reaction was performed under argon in a closed flask for approximately 50 days.

A complete solution was obtained by leaving the flask in an ultrasonic bath for several minutes. A 150mlglass reactor was evacuated and then filled with argon. The precatalyst solution was added under argon into the reactor vessel. Under stirring the co-catalyst MAO (0.6ml, approximately 100eq of a 10mol% MAO solution in toluene) and n-tridecane standard solution were added under argon. For several minutes ethylene was introduced while streaming through the reactor to displace the argon. Then the reactor was closed and pressurized to 3bar with ethylene. The reactor pressure maintained constant throughout the oligomerization run by manually controlled addition of ethylene. Runs were terminated by venting off volatiles and extracting the solution with dilute hydrochloric acid and water. Quantitative GC analysis of the organic layer was performed immediately after the extraction. (b) High-pressure tests: Same procedure as described for low-pressure tests. Instead of a glass reactor was used a 150ml stainless steel reactor with cooling mantle. After the reactor was closed it was pressurized to 30bar with ethylene. The temperature of the reaction was controlled by cooling the reactor vessel with water. 3 Results and discussion Iron-based bis(imino)pyridine complexes 6 and 7 and the acetyliminopyridine complex 8a were prepared to investigate the influence of methoxy- and trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl groups in the ligands (Fig. 1 ) [24]. It was previously reported that the length of the formed macromolecule and the selectivity to α-olefins depends on the steric bulk and on the electronic characteristics of the substituents on each aryl ring of the bis(imino)pyridine complexes [11,12]. We developed bis(imino)pyridine 1, 2 and the acetyliminopyridine ligand 3a with substituents which especially influence the electronic properties in the ferric precursor complexes 6–8a. 2,6-Bis(acetyl)pyridine reacts with m,p-methoxy and m,p-trifluoromethyl substituted anilines under different reaction conditions to the corresponding bis(imino)pyridine ligands 1, 2 and to the acetyliminopyridine 3a. For the syntheses of 1a, 2a, and 3a both reactants have to be stirred in benzene for many days whereas the reaction conditions are different for the syntheses of 1b and 2b [24]. The yields were not optimized and are fairly low for 2b (8%) and higher up to 90% for 1b. The ligands 1–3a react with FeCl2(thf)2 [17] to the Fe(II) complexes 6–8a (Fig. 2 ). It failed to prepare ligands with mixed methoxy- and trifluoromethyl- substituents because of decomposition of the reactants and the formation of side-products. The precatalysts 6–8a are active compounds in combination with the co-catalyst MAO in the oligomerization of ethylene (Table 1 ). The turnover number for the unsubstituted precatalyst 5 is one of the highest among the tested catalysts but it lacks a good selectivity in the production of α-olefins. The p-methoxy substituted precatalyst 6b produces α-olefins in up to 77% yield at 3 bar ethylene pressure, whereas when the pressure is increased to 30bar it gives α-olefins in 88% yield with a loss of catalytic activity. A positive effect for the production of α-olefins is however only observed for the p-substituted derivative 6b, not for the m-methoxy compound 6a. This is in line with the results from catalytic experiments with electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl-substituted derivatives 7a and 7b: in fact in case of p-trifluoromethyl substituents in 7b the selectivity is not improved. Only a low selectivity to α-olefins in 36 % yield is obtained with the m-trifluoromethyl derivative 7a. A different behavior of the precatalysts 5–8a is also shown in the distribution of the formed oligomers (Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 3 ). Mostly hexenes are formed with the bis(imino)pyridine precatalysts 5, 6a and 7, while butenes outweigh in case of the acetyliminopyridine precatalyst 8a. On the other hand 6b mostly gives butenes both at 3bar and 30bar ethylene pressure. The reaction temperature rises in all catalytic experiments with 5–8a. The catalytic activity decreases or completely stops when cooling the reaction vessel and keeping it at room temperature during the reaction. Higher ethylene pressure leads to an increased formation of α-olefins [11] in up to 82% yield (runs 4, 8, Table 1). The distribution of oligomers obtained in the catalyzed ethylene oligomerization with 5–8a follows Schulz–Flory rules for oligomers >C4, which can be characterized by the constant α representing the probability of chain propagation (α = rate of propagation/[(rate of propagation) + (rate of chain transfer)] = (moles of C n+2 )/(moles of C n )) [25–28]. The α value can be determined in our case by the molar ratio of C12 and C14 fractions (Fig. 4 ); the obtained α values range between 0.30 and 0.39 for the catalytic oligomerization runs with 5, 6, 7, and 8a. Pressure shows nearly no effect on the α-values (runs 4, 8), which is consitent with previous observations in bis(iminopyridine) complexes [11,12]. All α numbers found in the catalytic runs 1–8 are much lower than those described in the ethylene oligomerization catalyzed by the monoalkyl-substituted iron complexes which reach α values of 0.70–0.85 [11,12]. In contrast α between 0.33 and 0.34 are found for the reported 2,4-difluoro-substituted bis(imino)pyridine complexes [16], which is in line with the results for the precatalysts 5–8a. 4 Conclusions In summary, the described bis(imino)pyridine and the acetyliminopyridine complexes 5–8a reveal differences in their behavior as precatalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene, which depend on the different electronic influence of the various substituents at the rings and on the reaction conditions in these experiments, too. Olefins ranging from C4–C18 are produced in all experiments but the turnover numbers vary between 1000 and 43000. Additionally, variation of the catalyst ligand, temperature and pressure has a significant influence on α-olefin selectivity and on the formation of the main olefin species in the products. The complexes 5–8a show small Schulz–Flory α values, which prove a low chain propagation. References [1] D. Vogt, in: B. Cornils, W.A.
