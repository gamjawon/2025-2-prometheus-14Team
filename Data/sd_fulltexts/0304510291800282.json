(Received August 20, 1990; accepted December 10, 1990) Abstract Novel supported nickel catalysts for ethylene oligomerization have been 'synthesized. Thus, silica or alumina has been modified using PhzP-CHz-CHZ-Si(OEt)3. The resulting supported phosphine was reacted with equimolar amounts of bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel and triphenylphosphonium 2-oxo-2-phenylethylide, yielding: Ph2 Ph,, Ni CH2 Si(OE)n(OC2H5)3_n Ph Ph2 E=Si of silica or A1 of aluntina, n=1, 2 In this way a well-known homogeneous catalyst has been fixed on a support chemically. Activity and selectivity of the new catalysts are similar to those of the corresponding homogeneous Ph% PPh3 Ni Ph Ph2 but the activity can be increased tenfold by treatment with hydrogen. Introduction Homogeneous nickel catalysts with a phosphorus-oxygen-chelate ligand are known [ 1 ] to activate the oligomerization of ethylene to linear a-olefins *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 @)Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 368 under ethylene pressures of 60-80 bar and at temperatures below 373 K. These nickel complexes have high selectivities (98-99ss'o) and high activities in the 'oligomerization of ethylene. Technical usage of this catalyst type is made in Shell's Higher Olefins Process SHOP. A disadvantage to ethylene oligomerization in the SHOP process is the difficulty in separating the catalyst from the reaction products thus enabling catalyst recycle. In the SHOP process, recycle was made possible by operating in two=phase systems. We are now attempting to heterogenize the chelate Ni-complex on the surface of inorganic supports. Direct heterogenization of homogeneous chelate nickel complexes on the surface of inorganic supports (Si02, A1203) or of polymeric supports give catalysts active in ethylene oligomerization [2, 3]. However, these catalysts have lower activities and selectivities in comparison to homogeneous nickel complexes, arid enhance double bond isomerization and oligomerization of primary products, thus leading to branched alkenes [2]. The present paper deals with the synthesis of supported nickel complexes directly on the surface of phosphined supports, thus using the supported phosphine. as a complexing agent. Experimental All experiments were carried out in argon atmosphere or in vacuo. Silica (Davison 952), with a surface area of 260 m2 g-' and a pore volume of 1.6 cm' g-' was heated in air at 730 K for 6-8 h, then in vacuo at 630 K for 4 h. Treatment with a toluene solution of (Et0)3Si-CH2-CH2PPh2 at 353 K for 3 h yielded the desired support [4] after removing excess reagent by washing with toluene and drying in vacuo. The catalysts were synthesized by simultaneously reacting Ni(COD)2 and triphenylphosphonium 2-oxo-2-phenylethylide [5] with a toluene suspension of the modified support, using a molar ratio of P:Ni:P=1:1:1. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at 273 K, 30 min at 323 K and 12 h at 293 K. The catalysts were washed with toluene three times, filtered and dried in vacuo. The catalytic ethylene oligomerization was performed in a 200 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer and using an ethylene pressure of 10-50 bar. For the experiments a toluene suspension (50 ml) of catalysts (0.1 g) was used. The selectivity of the formed oligomer was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Results and discussion Previously, Peuckert and Keim [ 2 ] used polymeric supports containing phosphine ligands for the synthesis of nickel compounds. Although these catalysts had high activities and high selectivities, the yield of surface nickel complexes was low. 369 In the present article, the modification of silica and alumina was carried out separately in accordance with the known reaction scheme [4], viz: (E-OH),n + (EtO)3Si-CHZ-CH2-PPh2 --i (E-0-) ,Si(OEt)3_,,-CHZ-CH2-PPh2+nEtOH (1) n=1, 2; E=Si, Al The modified silica contained 0.25 wt.% P, the modified alumina 0.36 wt.O P. The IR spectra of the modified alumina is presented in Fig. 1. The absorption bands at 3732, 3692 and 3677 cm-' characterize different types of free hydroxy groups of alumina. Upon modification, the above bands disappear and new bands which are characteristic of the phosphine ligand appear, i.e. at 3060, 1587, 1483, 1435, 1391 and 1259 cm-'. The absorption bands appearing in the 2800-3000 region are characteristic of the vCHz and the vim absorption.

These findings correspond to a Ni/surface phosphane ligand molar ratio of - 1 and to a Y.P/Ni ratio of - 2 in the nickel complex 11 (see reaction (2)). The IR spectrum of the A1203/Ni catalyst complex is presented in Fig. 2. There are three new absorption bands, i.e., 1564, 1512 and 1346 cm-'. According to [ 6 J these absorption bands characterize the stretching vibration of adjacent unsaturated carbons, e.g. in a PCCCNi chelate ring. 372 In accordance with reaction (2), the IR and the chemical analysis data confirm the formation of the chelate nickel complex type II on the surface of Si02 and A1203. The catalytic properties of these catalysts in ethylene oligomerization are presented in Table 1. The activity and the selectivity of the supported nickel complex suspended in toluene are comparable to those of the homogeneous nickel complex I dissolved in toluene. However, for the Si02/Ni catalyst complex the selectivity is lower than that for the homogeneous Ni complex. The homogeneous and supported nickel complexes give close distribution of a-olefins (Table 2, exps. 1, 4 and 8). The formation of lower a-olefins (C4-C$) can be increased by the addition of triphenylphosphane to the catalyst system (Table 2, exps. 2 and 5). The thermal stability of the supported nickel complexes was tested by heating the catalyst system in toluene at 353 K for 2 h. Analysis thereafter indicated no change in the nickel content. Moreover, after the ethylene oligomerization was carried out, analysis showed the absence of nickel from the toluene solution. The supported nickel catalysts have sufficiently high activity not only in aromatic solvent but also in THF (Table 1). The activity of the supported catalysts can be increased considerably if the solid catalysts are treated with hydrogen at 353 K; in fact the highest effect of such activation was obtained for the A1203/Ni complex. For this catalyst system the product distribution changed, whereby the yield of lower a-olefins was observed to increase (Table 2, exps. 4 and 6). We assume that the treatment of the catalysts with hydrogen gives a surface nickel hydride. According to Peuckert and Keim [ 7 j, a nickel hydride is an active center intermediate for nickel complexes in ethylene oligomerization. However, all our attempts to identify the surface nickel hydrides by IR analysis were unsuccessful. References 1 (a) Ger. Ofem 2 053 758 (1971) to Shell International Research Maatschapp(j N.V. (P.
