Quantum efficiencies as high as 30%, have been obtained for the oxidation of formic acid. Light absorption increased with an increase in membrane thickness and could be fit to a LambertBeer expression. This increase in light absorption in thicker membranes caused more electron-hole pairs to be generated. Increasing the light intensity also increased the rate of carrier recombination processes. Consequently, a maximum in the quantum yield was observed at a particular thickness. Higher quantum yields were obtained at the lowest intensities. Key words: formic acid; membranes; light intensity; quantum yield; photocatalysis 1. Introduction Semiconductor powders suspended in aqueous solutions have often been used to carry out heterogeneous photocatalytic and photosynthetic processes [ 1-8]. The photocatalytic activity of the semiconductors depends not only on the chemical nature of the system, but also on the interfacial properties. Adsorption of solutes on the semiconductor surface plays a very important role in determining the rates at which these species degrade [ 9-11 ] . It has been demonstrated that a number of common organic solutes present in aqueous *Corresponding author. *'Present address: Chemical Engineering Department, University of Barcelona, Marti i Franques, 1,6, 08028 Barcelona, Spain. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

These solutes include a number of refractory aromatic compounds [ 12-16] . In addition, simple carboxylic acids, e.g., formic, acetic and oxalic acids, have been used as scavengers of holes generated by UV or visible irradiation of such semiconductors as TiOz, ZnO and CdS [ 10,17-22 ] . A major difficulty in the commercial scale-up of photocatalytic processes employing aqueous suspensions of semiconductors involves the necessity for recovery of the suspended solids from the product stream for subsequent reuse. Economic considerations mandate that this be done in a cost-effective manner. In an early attempt to circumvent this problem, Borgarello et al. [ 23 ] demonstrated that a CdS photocatalyst could be fixed on polycarbonate plates. Unfortunately, this particular system suffered problems of photocorrosion [24]. Other reports in the literature indicate the possibility of immobilizing titania particles on glass [ 25-29 ] . Detachment of ftania from the support can represent a problem when liquids circulate at high speeds. To alleviate this problem, other authors [9,30] have used sol-gel techniques to deposit semiconductor membranes on Pyrex supports and sintered the composite material. The resultant supported catalyst can then be used to effect the photodegradation of various organic compounds. To date, few attempts have been made to optimize these photocatalytic membrane systems. In this paper, we address the influence of light intensity and the properties of porous ftania membranes on the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of formic acid. Formic acid is a useful model compound for studies of photocatalytic efficiency because: (I) it has a simple molecular structure; (2) it is readily susceptible to photodegradation [ 31 ] ; (3) it is highly soluble in water; (4) there are very limited possibilities for the formation of intermediates (radicals); (5) it is known to act as a scavenger for the positive holes generated by irradiated semiconductors; and (6) mass transfer limitations on the reaction rate are minimized due to the small sizes of the reactant (formic acid and oxygen) and product species (CO, and H20) [9,32]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus Tests of several membranes have been carried out in a battery of photocatalytic reactors. In this system, it is possible to test simultaneously and independently the photocatalytic activity of six different membranes. The apparatus has been described in detail elsewhere [9]. Each of the six independent systems is composed of a Teflon flat microphotoreactor, a reservoir for the solution feedstock, a liquid recirculation pump (one peristaltic pump with six lines) and a gas distribution manifold. Liquid from the reservoir was recirculated by the pump through the photoreactor at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/s. The volumes of liquid in each reservoir and the associated reaction chamber were 150 and 4 ml, respectively. Air was continuously bubbled into the formic acid solution in each reservoir at a flow rate of 10 ml/s to ensure that the concentration of dissolved oxygen corresponds to a saturated solution. The concentration of formic acid (Aldrich, 96%) was measured using a conductivity probe (VWR Scientific conductivity meter- Model 604 with a gold cell having a cell constant of 10.8 cm-') [9,32]. A selective electrode (ORION) was used to measure the M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 167 2.5 A 4 2.0 A d 1.5 ,n LAMP SPECTRUM o 1.0 a Q 0.5 GLA 0.0 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 wavelength (nm) Fig. 1.

Labels represent the membranes described in Table 2. amount of oxygen dissolved in the formic acid solution. Temperatures were monitored via thermometers immersed in the reservoir of each system. Experiments were carried out at a temperature of 23 3 C. All photoreactors were irradiated simultaneously using a UVP black-ray lamp, model XL-15L. The emission of this lamp was in the range 300-410 nm, with the maximum intensity at 350 run (see Fig. 1). The intensity of the light incident on the photocatalytic membrane was controlled by adjusting the distance between the reactor and the lamp. An optometer (United Detector Technology, Model 380), using a 1 cm2 photodiode (Model 1222, calibrated at 365 nm) as a detector, was used to monitor the radiation intensity. Measurements of incident, reflected and transmitted radiation were made with each membrane at all incident radiation fluxes. 2.2. Materials 2.2.1. Preparation of colloids Three aqueous colloidal suspensions of titania were prepared using sol-gel techniques [33,34] . The chemicals used in these preparations were titanium isopropoxide, nitric acid (both Aldrich and analytical grade) and Milli-Q water. The experimental protocols used to prepare these three colloids are described below. ColloidA. This colloid was prepared by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide followed by peptization with nitric acid at 80 C for 3 days [ 33 ] . The resulting suspension was concentrated by vacuum rotary evaporation. The final colloid contained 5.7% (w /w) titania and had a pH of 0.8. Colloid B. This colloid was prepared similarly to colloid A except that the peptization step was carried out at 25 C. The resulting nearly clear solution was then placed in a dialysis membrane characterised by a molecular weight cut-off value of 3,500 (Spectrum Medical Industries, Spectra/Por 3) and immersed in 4 1 of Milli-Q water. Dialysis continued until 168 M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 165-178 Table 1 Properties of colloids A, B and C and the unsupported membranes prepared from these colloids Property of sol or Method of Colloid unsupported membrane determination A B C average diameter of light scattering 100 75 103 colloidal agglomerates (nm) diameter of primary X-ray diffraction 7.2 6.3 3.1 particle of unsupported membrane (nm) specific surface area of BET 131 147 157 unsupported membrane (M2/g) porosity of unsupported maximum 31 45 45 membrane (%) adsorption average diameter of Kelvin equation 3.0 4.0 4.5 pores in unsupported membrane (nm) the pH of the suspension reached 3.5. The resulting suspension contained 3.0% (w/w) titania. Colloid C. In this case, titanium isopropoxide was hydrolyzed in a nitric acid solution at low pH ( < 1) at room temperature. The clear solution was then dialyzed using a Spectra/ Por 3 membrane until the pH of the suspension was 4.4. In this case, titania particles were formed during dialysis. The resulting suspension contained 1.5% (w/w) titania. Table 1 contains a summary of pertinent properties of both the colloidal particles and the unsupported membranes prepared from these sols using the same firing (sintering) protocol used to prepare supported membranes (see below). 2.2.2. Preparation of supported titania membranes Titania films were cast on a Pyrex microscope slide (9 X 3 cm) using a spin coating procedure. The slides were spun at 3000 (colloid A) or 2000 rpm (colloids B and C) for 30 s. Next, the coated gel was dried at room temperature and the resulting xerogel fired from room temperature to 400 C at 3 C/min. The resulting thin porous film was held at 400 C for 4 h (membranes prepared with colloid A) or 2 h (membranes prepared with colloids B or C). This procedure was repeated as appropriate to deposit the number of layers necessary to achieve the desired thickness of the ceramic membrane. X-ray diffraction was used to confirm that the resulting photocatalyst was the anatase form of titania. The coated microscope slides were then mounted on the top of the flat photoreactors with the coated side down. In this position, the area of the surface of the membrane in contact M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 169 with the flow of formic acid solution was 12 cm2. When they were irradiated from the back with UV light, the membrane acted as a photocatalyst to effect the degradation of dissolved formic acid [ 9 ] . 3. Results The three colloids (A, B and C) were used to prepare 18 titania membranes with different thicknesses. For each supported membrane, three light intensities were used to study the effect of membrane characteristics and light intensity on the photocatalytic reaction. Table 2 summarizes some of the characteristics of these membranes. Each membrane/ support combination was weighed after the coating-firing process. The average diameter of the primary particles in each membrane was determined by X-ray diffraction. The thickness of the membrane was characterized using profilometry and/or ellipsometry while its index of refraction was determined by ellipsometry. The index of refraction was used to determine the membrane porosity using the assumption that voids were filled with air and that the bulk solid was pure anatase (X-ray measurements). Ellipsometry measurements of membrane were not possible to do when membrane surface is rough. In those cases, the membrane porosity is not available (Table 2) .

The amounts of light absorbed by the membrane for each of the three incident radiation fluxes employed are also shown in the table. The amount of light absorbed by each membrane was calculated by subtracting from the light intensity incident on the membrane, the sum of the intensities of the transmitted and reflected light (directly and internally reflected) [34]. Similar calculations were used by Auguliaro et al. [35] to calculate the amount of light absorbed by titania suspensions. The light intensities were evaluated from radiometric measurements which accounted for the spectrum of the lamp, the absorption spectra of the Pyrex slides and the membranes supported thereon (Fig. I) and the response of the radiometer [32]. The methodology employed to evaluate the radiation directly reflected was the following: ( I ) Fix one value of reflected flux density of radiation (W/cm2). (2) With the photodiode identify positions where the reflected flux density of radiation equals the fixed value. A surface can be drawn with the coordinates of these positions. (3) Calculate the area of the surface (cm2). (4) Evaluate the total amount of reflected radiation as a product of surface area and the value of radiation flux density (W). (5) Evaluate, using the same procedure, the amount of reflected radiation due to the support in the same surface calculated in 2. (6) Evaluate the amount of radiation reflected by the slide by subtraction of the two amounts evaluated in 4 and 5. The directly reflected radiation evaluated following this methodology was between 6 I % and 9 2% of the incident radiation. The losses of radiation by internal reflection were calculated mathematically [ 36] considering the index of refraction of titania and water and the thickness of the film. These losses were always less than 2% of the incident radiation. Fig. 1 contains plots of the absorption spectra of the group of membranes made with colloid A (AI-A6). The emission spectrum of the light source is also shown in arbitrary units. These curves indicate that the absorbance of the membrane increases with the number of layers of titania (similarly shaped curves were obtained for the other sets of membranes prepared with colloids B and C). The recirculation pump and air supply were turned on 30 min before any membrane was exposed to the radiation source in order to establish adsorption equilibria of chemicals over the membrane. In the experiments, the conductivity of the solution was monitored (concentration of formic acid) as well as the oxygen concentration. In all experiments, the oxygen concentration corresponds to saturation (8-9 ppm). Fig. 2 contains typical plots of the changes in the formic acid concentration (cue c) as a function of time during a given experiment. These data correspond to membranes Al-A6 subjected to a radiation of 8.17 10-s einstein s-1. For thin membranes ( <ca. 300 nm) the reaction rate increased dramatically as the membrane thickness increased (see Fig. 2). However, for membranes with thicknesses above ca. 300 nm, further increases in the thickness did not lead to proportionate increases in the rate of the reaction. The fact that, in all cases, the plots are linear indicates that the rate expression is zero-order with respect to the formic acid concentration. This behavior can be interpreted as membrane saturation with respect to formic acid adsorption [9]. Table 3 contains information concerning the initial concentrations of formic acid used in each experiment, as well as the corresponding zero-order rate constants for each of the three M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 171 40 Membrane thickneas(nm) X \"I + 95 105 30 273 0 443 d 572 v --~- 800 ti 10 0 0 2 4 6 8 time (h) Fig. 2.

These constants incorporate the dependence of the reaction rate on the intensity and wavelength distribution of the incident radiation. Concentrations of formic acid higher than 20 ppm were always used in order to keep this reactant in excess. These titania membranes are not completely saturated with adsorbed formic acid when the solution concentration is lower than 20 ppm [32]. 4. Discussion The data in Table 2 indicate that, for membranes containing the same number of Ti02 coatings, the thickness and weight of each layer depends on the precursor colloid used to fabricate the membrane. The amount of ftania deposited in a given layer and the thickness of this layer depend on the viscosity of the precursor sol. The viscosity of a given sol depends on particle-particle interactions which, in turn, are governed by the pH and ionic strength of the solution, as well as the particle size and concentration of the sol [37] . More viscous sols can be used to increase the thickness of the film deposited in the spinning process. However, as the viscosity of the sol increases, it becomes more difficult to control the manner and rate at which the colloidal suspension flows onto the spinning slide. Membranes A6, B6 and C6 (see Table 2) represent the maximum thicknesses that could be achieved using the indicated spinning process with colloids A, B and C, respectively. Attempts to produce thicker membranes resulted in delamination of the membranes from the Pyrex support. Comparison of the first few membranes of a set corresponding to the same colloid (see Table 2) indicates that there is an apparent increase in porosity when the thickness of the membrane is increased. However, it is well known that an increase in the firing time normally causes a decrease in the porosity of a membrane [ 34] . Hence one would expect that layers deposited in the early stages of preparing a given membrane would lose some porosity in subsequent firings. The experimentally observed increase in global porosity with increasing membrane thickness (Table 2) may be explained by the hypothesis that, when a new coating is placed on top of a previous ftania layer, repulsion between layers occurs due to the fact that the layers bear the same charge. Subsequent layers are expected to have more open structures. This means that not all of the membranes have the same porosity. This phenomenon does not occur when the titania gel is initially coated onto the Pyrex support because the sol and support possess different surface charge. The pH values of the isoelectric points of titania and silica are 6 and 2, respectively. Consequently, in the case of the first layer, a tighter electrostatic attachment may be produced and less porosity could be expected. This rationale may indicate why the resultant xerogels do not become more compact when subsequent layers are deposited and sintered. It should also be noted that increasing the thickness of a membrane by using multiple coatings may at some thickness be problematic due to the potential for delaminating the membrane. Inspection of the calculated values of the radiation absorbed by the membranes indicates that the number of photons absorbed increases as the membrane thickness increases (see Table 2). These values also indicate that the amount of light absorbed also depends on the level of the incident radiation flux on the membrane. Fig. 3 contains plots of the average absorbance of the membrane prepared from the three colloid precursors (evaluated from M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 173 2.0 I V COLLOID B 1.5 C / I R a o N / a ss 1.0 d /. of /' d *;'C0LL01DC i 0.5 -COLLOI A /o i I li i ~ l I 0.0 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Membrane thickness (nm) Fig. 3.

If the LambertBeer law is followed, the absorbance of the membrane (A) should be related to its thickness by the following equation. A=log[l0/(l0 -IA)] -e t (I) where IA is the total intensity of the radiation absorbed by the membrane (Table 2) and 10 is the intensity of the radiation at the membrane/glass interface (the incident light minus the light absorbed by the glass support). Increases in membrane thickness result in an increase in absorbance (Fig. 3). The values of the absorptivities (e) of the membranes formed from sols A, B and C were 6.3 2.3 X 10-4, 10.2 1.5 X 10-4, and 9.6 1.5 X 10-4 nm-1, respectively. These values correspond to the slopes of the three plots in Fig. 3. The fit is not very good due to the different absorptivity of the membranes at different wavelengths (Fig. 1) . The membranes formed from colloids B and C have comparable absorptivities. These absorptivities are higher than those of membranes prepared from colloid A. This difference in absorptivity can be explained by differences in the density of the membranes. For a given thickness of membrane, denser membranes contain more titania which is capable of absorbing the UV radiation. Our calculations indicate that the mean absorptivity of the titania contained in the various membranes is ca. 0.3 mg-1. Thus, membranes made from different colloids can have comparable absorptivities even though the properties of the precursor colloids differ (see Table 1) . Consequently, the porosity and grain size of the membrane precursor do not have a significant effect on the absorptivity of the final membrane. Examination of the plots in Fig. 1 indicates that absorbance increases when the membrane thickness is increased. However, one must realize that for large values of absorbance, very little radiation can penetrate deeply into the membrane or emerge from the rear surface thereof. In such cases, almost all of the photons capable of activating the semiconducting 174 M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 0.3 o c 00 d 0.2 o _L d ~' 0.1 E c i 0.0 -1-_ 0 200 400 600 800 membrane thickness (nm) Fig. 4.

Thus, as more catalyst is added, the number of photons absorbed does not increase proportionately. Under these conditions, significant fractions of the membrane may not be utilized efficiently. Therefore, for supported photocatalysts (for example, membranes), there should be a critical thickness which would provide an optimum balance between the competitive demands of a large mass of catalyst and efficient utilization of the incident radiation. In an effort to explore this phenomenon, the experiments whose results are depicted in Figs. 4-6 were conducted. These figures contain plots of quantum yield (O) vs. membrane thickness for membranes prepared from colloids A, B, and C, respectively. The quantum yields have been calculated from the following equation: M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 165-178 175 _ 2 X moles formic acid degraded (2) O moles of photons absorbed by the membrane The factor of two is introduced in Eq. 2 because the stoichiometry of the photochemical reaction is such that two moles of holes are required per mole of formic acid degraded [9,10,17,19-22]. While each absorbed photon generates a single electron-hole pair, (3) only some of these electrons and holes lead to reactions HCOOH + 2h + -j COZ + 2H + (4 ) 2102+2e-+2H+-H20 (5) while the remainder recombine to liberate thermal or radiant energy. The highest quantum yield is observed when the intensity of incident light is low (see data for intensity R in Figs. 4-6). This phenomenon can be attributed to the effect of the incident intensity on the relative rates of recombination and chemical reaction processes involving electron-hole pairs. For a given membrane thickness, an increase in the absorbed radiation flux causes an increase in the concentration of e--h+ pairs. This increased concentration, in turn, results in an increase in the probability of the subsequent recombination reaction and a concomitant decrease in the quantum yield. For extremely thin membranes, the quantum yields found were low (See Figs. 4 to 6). For these membranes, an excess of e--h+ pairs are formed as compared to the amount of formic acid adsorbed. This high concentration of carriers leads to their recombination. In the same fashion, in some cases when the membrane is thick, the quantum yield decreases again (see Figs. 4-6). The first layers of the thicker membranes have a low porosity and consequently the amount of formic acid adsorbed is low. On the other hand, the first layers are those receiving the largest amount of irradiation and consequently they have the highest m 0.3 P c .(D _+_ Q 9 ) CD =~'r-- d 0.2 o i~ .o -,A!r.i\" o m - %. a 0.1 c a o.o 0 200 400 600 membrane thickness (nml Fig. 6.

Therefore, due to the combination of these effects, a decrease in quantum yield is expected. These effects are well illustrated, for example, by the data obtained for the membranes made from colloid B (see Fig. 5) . For this case, quantum yields are relatively constant for thicknesses between 500 and 1200 nn. These results indicate that possibly there exists an optimum combination of incident light intensity and membrane characteristics (thickness and density). The tendency of photocatalyst rate to increase with film thickness and finally reach a maximum was reported by Formenti et al. [ 38 ] . Transport limitations might also be invoked to explain why the efficiency decreased with increasing thickness. We have examined this issue in an earlier paper [30]. No external mass transfer limitations were found and neither were any mass transfer limitations for the transport of oxygen and formic acid within the pores. This behavior is expected according to the Thiele modulus for this reaction [ 9 ] . Due to the low concentration of oxygen used in these experiments (9 ppm), its concentration could be drastically reduced next to the membrane. However, knowing that the highest reaction rate achieved was less than 6 ppm h-' (Table 3), and considering the volume of reactor (4 ml) and the solution flow rate (0.35 ml/s), a decrease of 0.02 ppm in the formic acid concentration and 0.006 ppm in the oxygen concentration is expected for the solution within the reaction chamber. In this case, no significant change in reactant concentration is produced. Therefore we conclude that mass transfer limitations are not important in these experiments. It thus appears that the majority of problems associated with the loss in efficiency from increasing the thicknesses of these membranes stems from electron-hole recombination phenomena. The following calculation has been made in order to estimate the dominance of carrier recombination in these experiments. For zero order rates, the ratio of rates at two different light intensities should be: rt k` k Ita=(hllz) (6) r2 k2 k Iz where r; are the reaction rates, k; the zero order constant, k a constant, I, is the intensity of light absorbed by the membrane and a the exponent. If a = 1 the reaction rate is radiationdominated but if a=0.5 the process is dominated by the recombination of carriers. The logarithmic form of expression (6) reduces to one line with slope a. logk, -alogl' (7) k2 IZ The values of a obtained for each group of membranes were for: colloid A 0.78 0.20; colloid B 0.53 0.14; colloid C 0.60 0.22. It therefore seems that formic acid oxidation over membranes prepared with colloid B or C is dominated by carrier recombination [ 39 ] . 5. Conclusions In order to scale up a photocatalytic process based on supported Ti02 photocatalysts prepared by sol-gel methods, one must optimize the catalyst employed. Two aspects of this M.A. Aguado et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994)165-178 177 optimization are essential to the successful implementation of this technology: (1) that associated with the absorption of radiation and (2) that associated with the rates of reactions of the charge carriers (holes or electrons) with the reactants. With respect to light absorption by the photocatalyst: (1) Only the mass of the titania membrane influences its capacity for absorbing radiation. (2) Neither the size of precursor colloid particles from which the membrane is formed nor the porosity of the membrane has a significant effect on the absorption of UV radiation. (3) UV absorption by titania membranes can be described by the Lambert-Beer relation. With respect to the rates of reaction of the positive holes and electrons: (1) An increase in the intensity of the incident radiation leads to an increase in the amount of light absorbed. However, the rate of recombination of e--h+ pairs is also enhanced at higher intensities. Hence, the quantum yield decreases with increasing intensity of illumination. (2) For a given intensity of incident light, a thin membrane has a higher concentration of e--h+ pairs than a thick membrane, so that recombination processes are promoted in thin membranes. However, in thicker membranes, holes must travel greater distances to catalytic sites where formic acid is adsorbed, a process that increases the probability of e--h+ recombination prior to reaction. Due to these two opposing effects, an optimum combination of thickness and intensity of light is expected. This optimum combination depends on porosity of the membrane. We have prepared titania membranes which can capture nearly 74% of the near UV-light (Membrane B6) . For our best membranes (B3-B5) , an apparent quantum yield of ca. 30% has been obtained for the degradation of formic acid. Photoefficiencies of ca. 16% with respect to incident intensities are obtained for membrane B6. The maximum rate of degradation of formic acid over titania membranes was nearly 6 ppm h- ' at 23 C for membrane B5. This rate corresponds to a reaction rate per mass of catalyst of 0.62 g HCOOH per gram of catalyst per hour or 1.06 mol of HCOOH degraded per mole of Ti02 per hour. This value corresponds to a turnover number for this catalyst of around one per hour. 6.

The photocatalytic activity of ceramic membranes for the oxidation of dissolved formic acid has been evaluated as a function of the membrane thickness and porosity, as well as the intensity of the incident light. Quantum efficiencies as high as 30% have been obtained for the oxidation of formic acid. Light absorption increased with an increase in membrane thickness and could be fit to a Lambert-Beer expression. This increase in light absorption in thicker membranes caused more electron-hole pairs to be generated. Increasing the light intensity also increased the rate of carrier recombination processes. Consequently, a maximum in the quantum yield was observed at a particular thickness. Higher quantum yields were obtained at the lowest intensities.
