Optical microscopy and SEM/EDX were used to investigate the disposition of several structural motives. The heterogeneity of distribution of the promoter oxides was confirmed to exist on all levels of resolution. The microstructural discrimination of the iron metal into several distinct features and the porous structure of the iron crystals were made visible. An EXAFS experiment on these catalyst particles confirms that all iron structures are made-up from bcc iron unit cells and that the discrimination of the iron species should result from textural rather than from atomic structural differences. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The scientific interest in ammonia synthesis is still high despite the exhaustive investigation over the years. Among the topics of interest the question about the microstructure of the activated catalyst and the scientific explanation of its preparation and activation are of high priority [1--4]. Following the results of surface science it is the general conjecture [5-7] that the technical ammonia synthesis catalyst contains surfaces structurally iden- tical to potassium covered (1 1 1) faces of metallic *Corresponding author.

There the same elementary steps produce ammonia as they were identified in model studies on single crystals. This conjecture was strongly supported by a theoretical bridge over the pressure gap between model and technical studies which used the surface science data as input [9,10]. In an earlier study on the microstructure of the activated catalyst we found direct evidence for a platelet structure of iron exposing the (1 1 1) face as basal plane [11,15]. In a model study on the considerable catalytic activity of Fe-Zr amorphous alloys it was also found that thin platelets of iron exposing the (1 1 1) orientation cause the high activity [12,13]. In a recent electron crystallographic study of 84 G. Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 several activated catalysts the micromorphology of platelets as one component of the multi-structural material was confirmed [1]. It was shown that these platelets exposed the (1 0 0) face which is consider- ably less active than the (1 1 1) face [14]. It was possible, on the other hand, to confirm the chemical identity of the activated catalyst surface and a potas- sium-covered iron (1 1 l) surface using thermal de- sorption of molecular nitrogen at low temperature as probe reaction [8]. The present study tries to elucidate the microstruc- ture of an activated triply promoted iron catalyst with documented catalytic history. The technique of optical microscopy is applied as survey method whereas the present main methods of high resolution SEM and EDX can be considered as complementary to spatially restricted HRTEM studies [15,1]. The present work cannot determine crystallographic details of the cata- lyst constituents but analyses the elemental distribu- tion and gives an integral picture of the correlation between the various structural elements. In this way a continuation of the already substantial efforts [16] is attempted to understand the structure-reactivity relationship. In addition, we report about an EXAFS experiment carried out with the catalyst material used for the micromorphological studies. Such an experiment was carried out before [17] as in situ study with a different catalyst material and revealed the identity of the atomic structures of bcc and ammonia iron. 2. Experimental The conversion experiments were carried out with batches of 0.600 g of isotropic particles of 1.2 mm in diameter. A sample of H. TOPSOE KM1 was used in this study. A microreactor with NDIR on-line detec- tion for ammonia was used and conversion tests in stoichiometric ammonia synthesis gas were carried out with pre-purified gases and a protection reactor with activated catalyst upstream of the test reactor. The absence of hysteresis effects upon changing tem- perature of gas flow in the ammonia output response was taken as criterion for suitable testing conditions [18]. The catalyst sample was carefully passivated with a nitrogen-oxygen mixture at 423 K with no detectable overheating from the internal thermocouple response. After additional 48 h of the sample under passivation gas at 300 K the catalyst was taken out of the reaction and stored in air for several months. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample showed the presence of some magnetite besides a majority phase of bcc iron. A quantification was not possible due to the pronounced texture effects in the diffraction experi- ment of such large sample grains. Catalyst grains were mounted on iron wire to ensure electrical contact and fixed in metallurgical resin. A grinding procedure down 3 ~m average roughness using non-aqueous materials under nitrogen protec- tion yielded an optically smooth surface suitable for analytical electron microscopy. The surface was then electropolished in several cycles in a chlorine-free electrolyte to remove the defective grinding surface which was well-discernible in SEM images of the as- ground samples. Chemical etching experiments in different acidic and complex-forming media gave always blurred images due to the formation of oxidic scales on the optically smooth surfaces. Also the electropolished samples were unstable with respect to an oxide scale which became detectable in the SEM 48 h after electropolishing. We present data from a collection of seven individual grains in the freshly electropolished state unless otherwise stated (see Fig. 6). A Hitachi S-4000 instrument equipped with a field emission gun was used at acceleration voltages between 15 and 1.0keV. The TN EDX system attached was used with a polymer foil window with the sample at 15tilted in the surface normal towards the collimator. The EXAFS sample was not passivated but taken out from the reactor in a glove box under clean At. It was transferred after suitable dilution with BN powder and crushing into 0.1 mm particles into an air-tight cell with Be windows and In gaskets. The measure- ments and data analysis were performed at Daresbury Laboratory in transmission geometry with the sample at 78 K. Great care was taken to ensure a homoge- neous absorber which was comparable to a reference sample of iron powder (70 mesh) in BN placed after the experiment in the same sample holder as the catalyst. An X-ray diffraction scan of the used catalyst sample after the EXAFS experiment ensured the pre- sence of a distorted bcc iron diffraction pattern (para- crystallinity index ca. 0.9%) and the absence of G. Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 85 crystalline iron oxide phases. Air exposure after the control experiment caused a detectable warming up of the sample and the formation of magnetite and hematite besides elemental iron. 3. Results 3.1. Catalyst conversion In order to investigate the microstructure of the fully activated material, the samples were not activated for only a short time or simply reduced in hydrogen. A full activation and stationary performance test was carried out with the material prior to specimen preparation for electron microscopy. Fig. 1 presents some data obtained after 240 h on stream. Each data point is the average reading of two experiments carried out for 24 h with the temperature being adjusted from higher and lower values, respectively. The numerical error was found to be smaller than the size of the symbols used. The complete absence of hysteresis effects [l 1] upon temperature changes ensures that the catalyst is fully active and contains no significant volume frac- tion of unreduced precursor. Oxidic residual material would provide a continuous source of gas contamina- tion leading to significant spreading in the data points of Fig. 1. These data are used to suggest that the material is fully homogeneous in its chemical function and allows thus to extrapolate the results from the small imaged volumes to the average of the sample and to deduce a certain degree of universality of the present results. 3.2. Optical microscopy After grinding and electropolishing, individual cata- lyst particles were investigated in the polarised light optical microscope. Fig. 2 shows a typical image. Large grains of iron are separated by a system of boundaries filled with a granular material as seen from the profile scan along such a boundary. The particles form a network of pores with openings in the micron range providing a macropore system for gas transport. The material also prevents the large iron grains from sintering. The grains are terminated by regular faces some of which are stepped as can be seen from the high magnification image. Smaller grains are intern- E Q..

Survey optical micrograph of an electropolished sample under polarised light causing the light and dark contrast within the iron grains (see text). The profile was taken along a channel between metal grains. The small image shows inclusions and regular shapes of the secondary iron grains forming the macroscopic catalyst particles as seen in the main image. ally homogeneous, large grains contain inclusions of the porous material indicating that they were formed by a sintering process occurring in iron volumes in which the grains had contact with each other without the granular material acting as spacer. All iron grains exhibit a core and shell structure. The shells are associated with oxidic material (probably magnetite) formed during passivation and sample preparation. The fact that the shells are of irregular shape and varying thickness indicates internal heterogeneity and the presence of internal structure in the 'smooth' grains below the resolution limit of optical micro- scopy. The macroscopic catalyst grains contain a tertiary structure made up of particles with a regular morphol- ogy of metal separated by a layer of porous and brittle material (preferential removal during sample prepara- tion as seen from the deeper level of the granular areas). The iron grains contain some micron size inclusions of the porous material and are occasionally partially sintered. This contact between the iron grains accounts for the high mechanical stability of the iron catalyst. 3.3. Analytical scanning electron microscopy Fig. 3 summarises the results of low-magnification EDX analysis. It can be seen that an internal grain structure (the object in Fig. 3 is a single grain on the scale of Fig. 2) can be resolved as a system of thin cracks and inclusions of low secondary electron emis- sion. The holes within compact grains may indicate the formation of gas bubbles during the fusion process of the precursor. The fact that a 25 Wt% loss of material during activation did not lead to the occur- rence of regular or frequent holes, is a further indica- tion for a non-compact structure at a size level below the resolution of this image. The optically homogeneous parts (area 3) of the grain consist mainly of iron with small amounts of structural promoter elements binding most of the oxygen detected. The electronic promoter potassium is detectable only in a concentrations at the detection limit indicating its high dispersion as surface film [15,191.

Characteristic EDX spectra and the respective locations (numbers) illustrate the elemental heterogeneity. The EDX spectra were accumulated with 15 keV excitation in the point mode. In this and all following images no additional metal or carbon was placed on the specimen surface for enhancement of conductivity which was guaranteed by the metallic contact of the catalyst grain through the backside of the specimen. No electron beam modification or contamination occurred during analysis as can be seen from the image which was recorded after the analytical data were accumulated. ~a \"-,4 88 G. Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 analyses (areas I, 2, 4). Some inclusions are segre- gates of promoter oxides with little or no iron in them, or local enrichments of impurities such as Ti and V (area 2). Area 4 is either micro-heterogeneous or contains a ternary Fe-Ca oxide. The sample is chemically heterogeneous at dimen- sions small compared to the grain size seen in the optical microscope. The composition of the hetero- inclusions is variable over a wide range. Within the resolution limit of the image also the 'homogeneous' areas contain structural promoters in a finely divided form, Not one spot was found exhibiting analytically pure iron without non-oxygen heteroatoms at this resolution. Using lower acceleration voltages and higher reso- lution, a lamellar secondary structure was found in about every third grain looking homogenous at high acceleration voltage. Fig. 4 summarises morphologi- cal and analytical results. Both lamellar and irregular inclusions can be seen in a matrix exhibiting a spongy morphology. High-resolution spot EDX reveals that the spongy structure is elemental pure iron with slight impurities of promoter oxides. The inclusions repre- sent a mixture of oxides and iron. The special geo- metric conditions for high resolution EDX prevent the oxygen peaks to reflect the elemental concentration due to massive absorption effects, A distinction between iron and iron oxide as main component in the lamellae is not possible. The observation that the Fe to Ca ratio was variable within a single lamella allows to conclude that the material is a mixture of metal and oxide(s) and not a pure ternary iron oxide. 3.4. Micromorphology of iron grains Typical situations at internal boundaries are exem- plified in Fig. 5. Several types of inclusions can be seen as well as the spongy and anisotropic structure of the iron matrix phase. Of particular value are the cracks and their relative orientations as they indicate the directions of further internal boundaries. The parallel orientation of these cracks is a strong indica- tion that the basic structural units of the matrix are anisotropic and exhibit a platelet morphology. The size of the basic structural units is small with respect to the scale of the images in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(A) an inclusion is shown which is encap- sulated by a layer of matrix phase with the basic structural units being oriented parallel to the edges of the inclusion as concluded by the crack pattern. In a distance of about 20 ~tm a regular grain boundary system separates the layer of matrix from the main body of the matrix which is characterised by different orientation of the basic structural units resulting in a different orientation of the crack pattern. Fig. 5(B) and (C) reveal the grain boundaries along large and regular blocks of matrix phase which are spongy in their packing. Sizes of about 1 ~tm or even below of the basic structural units can be deduced from the spongy appearance of the blocks. In Fig. 5(B) the blocks are separated by a spacer phase which is eroded faster than the matrix giving rise to the sharp trench. In Fig. 5(C) this separation phase seems to be present in a lump form giving rise to the decoration of the grain boundary by a row of irregular holes. The spongy structure was a characteristic feature of all seven catalyst grains which were independently prepared. Fig. 6 summarises high resolution images. Samples A, B were prepared by electropolishing, samples C, D by additional chemical etching with nitric acid. The existence of a secondary structure with small pores can be seen in all images. The electro- polished surfaces reveal an anisotropic distribution of elongated platelets and pores whereas this impression is wiped out in the chemically etched samples by the existence of a insulating surface layer of more iso- tropic particles which are associated with a thin oxide overlayer formed during sample preparation. Great care was taken to account for the ferromagnetic effects on the astigmatism which was computer-controlled following adjustment at occasional spherical dust particles sitting over areas as displayed in Fig. 5. In Fig. 7 a high resolution image of the main material of the catalyst grains is combined with line scans for characteristic promoter elements. The inset reveals again the anisotropic nature of the basic struc- tural units and the existence of a system of small pores in the dimension 10 nm. The compact line is a vein of oxide material. The line scan analysis reveals a mutually exclusive lateral distribution of the promo- ters in the way that potassium is located within the particles and Ca at the periphery of each particle. This is in line with the notion of the function of the structural promoters as spacers between the structural units of the secondary structure. It is assumed that the basic structural units are covered with potassium in Fig. 4. Images and analytical identification of lamellar structures in a spongy matrix. The large dark area at the right-hand side of the survey image is an inclusion of pure iron with a crack system arising from post-catalytic oxidation. 2 L,j OO I 90 G.

For a detailed discussion see text. full agreement with surface science analytical results [ 19-21 ]. Between these particles we find pores and the Ca compound as spacer material. The platelet structure was further resolved by STEM. Fig. 8 reveals a stack of platelets overlapping partly with compact small particles in-between. The corresponding elemental analysis shows the presence of promoter elements in this small volume of the catalyst in much the same way as for large volumes analysed in Fig. 3. The dominating impression of Ca as promoter given by the data in Figs. 7 and 8 is characteristic for a particular grain. In other grains the dominating pro- moter element was A1 which occurred always together with Si. In earlier STEM images [15] of very similar appearance the particles contained almost no Ca but a similar total abundance of A1 and Si. High resolution SEM images at 200 keV accelera- tion voltage are presented in Fig. 9. The top images present surfaces with small particles of the same size as seen in STEM in Fig. 8 which are assumed to be the spacer oxide particles. In the small image in Fig. 9 on top and in the large image it can be seen that the material is not uniformly smooth but is formed from stacks of platelets. In the top image a stack exposing the basal faces can be seen. The main image in Fig. 9 represents a view on the prismatic faces. These images, obtained at the resolution limit of the method, support the view that the spongy structure of Fig. 7 is made up from anisotropic particles. 3.5. Artefacts Artefacts can occur either from precipitation of oxide particles in the wet chemical specimen prepara- tion processes or during gas phase passivation. Active catalysts are pyrophoric and oxidise vigorously in air. Careful passivation is thus pre-requisite to observe unsintered structures. Slow after-oxidation occurs under transformation of the average sample morphol- ogy if the passivation was insufficient. Fig. 10 sum- marises characteristic observations. The catalyst is split by large cracks separating compact grains as seen in the previous figures from volumes with a granular structure. Iron grains (EDX, not shown) in the micron range are formed under disintegration of G. Weinberg et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 91 Fig. 6. Characteristic SEM images of the spongy iron structure in several samples. Images A, B were obtained from electropolished surfaces, images C, D from chemically etched surfaces (for details see text). the previously compact solid. These particles can also exhibit more anisotropic forms and are covered in some areas by large segregates of oxide material (not shown in Fig. 10). A disintegration of the structural components with the consequence of sintering of the iron and the exsolution and sintering of the spacer oxide particles has occurred. 3.6. EXAFS analysis The local and qualitative character of the micro- scopic findings calls for an average and integral com- plement. In particular, the possibility that the dis- crimination into platelets and compact iron might be traced back to atomically homogeneous and inhomo- geneous basic structural units which is suggested by the paracrystallinity theory needs to be excluded as M6ssbauer spectroscopic data [2] indicate the pre- sence of only one single species of isotropic bcc iron. A pioneering in situ EXAFS study [17] confirmed the existence of only one species of bcc iron with no significant presence of heteroatoms. An anomaly was stated in the intensity of the EXAFS amplitude which would point to a cluster-type of basic structural units which was stated, however, to be incompatible with all structural studies on the system so far. As EXAFS amplitudes are subject to many experimental problems we decided to try and an ex situ study with respect to the intensity problem. A comparison was made between iron powder and the activated catalyst. The qualitative analysis pre- sented in an earlier report [15] fully confirmed the identity of the atomic structure of bcc iron with that of the catalyst. The high quality of the data in terms of 92 G. Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 Fig. 7. High resolution SEM of the spongy structure of the matrix. The elemental line scans indicate the complementary distribution of characteristic promoter elements in the matrix. A freshly polished surface and the absence of sputtered metal overlayers are required to obtain such images. signal to noise ratio further excluded the possibility of the presence of an additional minority species with a different local atomic structure. These findings indicate that the kinetics of the formation of the bcc iron under the condition of activation and due to the presence of the promoter elements controls the formation of several mesoscopic structures of iron particles made up all from the same bcc iron. The images described above thus all show bcc iron and cannot be explained in terms of the paracrystallinity theory [22] as different polymorphs of iron created by endotactic impurities. We also detected the problem of a lack of EXAFS amplitude which seems to be a characteristic of the activated catalyst iron as the conditions of our experi- ment did not contain several of the methodical pro- blems of the in situ experiment. In Table 1 the results of the EXAFS analysis of the reference powder and the activated catalyst are com- pared. The clear disagreement of the co-ordination numbers derived is apparent. In order to resolve this problem, a model was developed accounting for par- ticle size effects. If the particle size is reduced, the influence of the surface atoms on reducing the average coordination number becomes increasingly signifi- cant. This is shown in Fig. 11 for different co-ordina- tion shells and particle sizes. It runs out that the relative change in co-ordination number depends on the shell investigated; for the first shell the effect is less drastic than e. g. for the fourth co-ordination shell. The size of the relative difference of about 50% gives a handle on the detection of particle anisotropy. A small isotropic particle will show in higher coordination shells a larger reduction in the EXAFS amplitude than for lower co-ordination shells. If the particle is aniso- tropic then the reduction in amplitude will be less drastic in higher shells than expected from the ampli- tude reduction observed for the lower shells. In Fig. 12 the good agreement is shown between the experimental Fourier transform of the catalyst EXAFS and a model assuming bcc iron with a particle size of 0.5 nm. In the four shell model no multiple scattering contributions were taken into account. Table 1 reveals that the positional deviations are insignificant in terms of atom positions whereas the intensity deviations are quite significant in terms of lack in co-ordination. The trend that the isotropic small particle overestimates the amplitude losses for high co-ordination numbers is apparent. The data in Table 1 imply that for high co- ordination shells the particles resemble much more the G.

Particles and mesoscopically rough surfaces of the iron platelet stacks can be seen. model of the reference powder with infinite particle size whereas for the first co-ordination shell the devia- tion in amplitude is well accounted for with the 0.5 nm particle. The platelet anisotropy seen in the electron micrographs can account for this discrepancy. In this case EXAFS data would provide an independent and integral indication that the average iron structure is anisotropic in the activated catalyst whereas the nor- mal iron powder is perfectly isotropic. The morpho- logical anisotropy would then be one important factor in explaining the catalytically very different function of iron powder and ammonia iron. 4. Discussion The present study showed that a promoted iron catalyst after extended use under laboratory test con- ditions exhibits a complex microstructure which is far away from isotropic elemental iron. Several distinctly different dispositions of basic structural iron units in compact or spongy arrangements were found. This illustrates that the active iron catalyst is not only heterogeneous in the distribution of iron and the promoter elements [ 15,19,23,24] but also in the micro- structure of the iron metal phase itself.

This is in full agreement with M6ssbauer and other EXAFS results all confirming without doubt the existence of only bcc iron as the local metal structure. The main observation in the activated catalyst is that at all levels of resolution isotropic and several non- isotropic structures of elemental iron co-exist. The anisotropic forms of iron were accompanied by the presence of promoter compounds in high dispersion. The dispersion of potassium as a film [25] at the surface of each iron particle, which was also found in surface analytical studies [19-21], was confirmed by the absence of particles of alkali oxides and by the lateral distribution analysis shown in Fig. 7. It was further suggested in several studies [ 19,24,26] that the 96 G.

Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 97 structural promoters should be present in particulate morphology. STEM observations support this view and allowed to analyse the composition of the struc- tural promoter oxide particles, and to estimate dimen- sions of the basic structural units. The bimodal pore size distribution which was found from adsorption studies [26,27] can be localised in different sub-units in the structural organisation of the activated catalyst. The large pores with micron size diameter are located in the particulate intergrain layers connecting the grains of the tertiary structure. The narrow pores in the 10 nm range are located within the main iron matrix composed of the secondary structure of particles with pores and promoter oxide particles in- between. The particles of the secondary structure are com- posed from platelets of iron with small oxide granules as spacers which is in agreement with an earlier model [ 15] and recent TEM observations (1). These platelets are about 10 nm thick and several hundred nm wide and form turbostratic stacks. The orientation of the platelets was found in the TEM study [1] to be (1 0 0) as basal plane whereas we found in a previous study [11] the (1 1 1) orientation as basal plane. In view of the complexity of the catalyst microstructure it is well conceivable that both types of platelets can co-exist. A spongy structure of the secondary iron grains was found as a dominating feature in the SEM investiga- tion of the activated catalyst. This is in disagreement to the TEM study [1] which stated only a minority of the catalyst to be spongy besides a main fraction of dense iron. Differences in the chemical and thermal history of the samples and differences in the observa- tion techniques may be responsible for this discre- pancy. The impression of a dense surface can further occur from a thin oxide scale covering the mesopores within the iron grains. This highlights the relevance of artefacts in this, towards ambient conditions, reactive system when quantification is attempted. The para- crystallinity parameter, the BET surface area and all EXAFS data point to an integral presence of aniso- tropic iron basic structural units causing mesopores as a typical feature of the ammonia iron. The EXAFS experiment confirmed earlier conclu- sions obtained by EXAFS and Mtssbauer spectro- scopy [17,15,2]. The observed lack of EXAFS amplitude is seen in conjunction with the spongy structure of the activated material with platelets and pores of comparable geometric dimensions which renders ammonia iron certainly different from com- pact iron. Model calculations on the EXAFS ampli- tudes suggest that the iron metal platelets are indeed the average basic structural unit as with this assump- tion the lack in EXAFS amplitude can be rationalised. An average isotropic iron basic structural unit would have to invoke heteroatoms within the unit cells of bcc iron for the presence of which no evidence was found in the k-space distribution of the oscillation patterns. X-ray diffraction line profile and intensity data in the literature [15,22] can be interpreted as indication that the X-ray average of the sample is not isotropic but consists of platelets with different degree of structural perfection. The texture of the platelets was not analysed in the present work to but should be different from an average (1 0 0) orientation [l ] which should have resulted in a different intensity distribution of the X-ray diffraction data than that reported in the literature [ 15,22]. 5. Conclusion The present study revealed that an iron particle in a macroscopic catalyst grain of proven catalytic is not composed of dense isotropic iron but of a spongy structure of irregular stacks of iron platelets of a few nm thickness and up to 100 nm average diameter. Locations of intergrowth between platelets provide mechanical strength, particulates of non-reducible oxides act as spacers and create a pore system with several nm as characteristic diameter. The alkali pro- moter is not located in particulate matter but is spread as a thin film over the platelets [19]. Several types of platelets differing in orientation of their surface nor- mal may co-exist and can account for the discrepancy of TEM observations [1,11] which are all very punc- tual in nature. The present study is not aimed at a quantitative description of the microheterogeneity. Reservations have to be made in order to account for the completeness of a morphological study on the one hand and for the exclusion of specimen prepara- tion artefacts on the other hand. As only a fraction of all surface sites is involved in the catalytic process, this fraction may well be corre- lated with a fraction of platelets oriented such that the 98 G. Weinberg et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 83-99 basal planes are higher indexed than (1 1 0). Such high-indexed planes were identified as the most active ones for dissociating molecular nitrogen which is the rate-determining step in ammonia synthesis [7]. Would the complete removal of this structure- sensitivity by the presence of potassium [14] be valid for high-pressure ammonia synthesis, than any iron with highly dispersed potassium as surface film would be a good catalyst and all the development into the complex precursor and activation chemistry would not be required. We prefer the view that among the manifold of iron morphologies there is at least one structure which consists of stacks of platelets with a high-indexed surface normal [8,4,28]. The optimisation of the content of this frac- tion in the manifold of the iron structures by solid-state chemical measures would then be the ultimate goal of a rational catalyst development. The fact that this particular structure is energetically meta-stable and that the conditions of activation provide sufficient possibilities for the creation of more stable varieties of structures such as isotropic bcc iron sets a narrow limit to the maximum obtainable abundance of the desired structure. The packages of basic structural units form grains which seem almost isotropic in the resolution of the light microscope. There we observe the second level of structural organisation of the macroscopic catalyst grain which is made up of packages of iron and a layer of larger segregates of non-reducible promoters generating a pore system with several microns as characteristic dimension. The topotactic reduction and its kinetic modifica- tion by the presence of promoters decide over orienta- tion and compactness of the basic structural units and over the distribution between large and small preci- pitates of non-reducible oxides. This notion explains the observation that the details of the activation pro- cedure decide over the quality of the final catalyst [15]. Further, it is not desirable to accelerate the activation [29] as rapid reduction of the oxides would inevitably disturb the co-operation of the slow solid- state reaction steps and hand over the control of the iron metal growth to the defect distribution of the precursor oxide. The influences of epitaxy and energy minimisation by anisotropic ion migration [30] which are the handles for a rational modification of the iron catalytic properties would be annihilated by activation procedures optimised for the velocity of oxide conversion. The kinetic details of the activation are the origin of the textural organisation of the active iron which, in contrast to the dense metallurgical reduction products, forms a metallic sponge at the level of microstructure as well as at the mesoscopic level. The observation of anomalies in powder X-ray diffraction of active iron catalysts and the EXAFS analysis are good indicators that the non-equilibrium state of iron shown here represents a significant frac- tion of the bulk catalyst material in its fully active state. On an atomic level the complexities described here are not detectable, as all basic structural units are composed of normal bulk elemental iron. It was shown here and by an earlier in situ X-ray diffraction experiment [28] that chemical reactions with the metastable iron such as oxidation by air lead to an equilibration of the texture and result in a loss of the spongy structure and in catalytic activity [28]. The present study cannot answer the question about the bulk abundance of the spongy structure in any given catalyst material with eventual unclear chemical pre- history. Our sample was rich in this spongy structure, the observations from another sample in the literature [ 1 ] stated only small portions of spongy structure. The manifold of iron microstructures described in the literature [1] may be taken as indication that the material was subjected to a low-energy recrystallisa- tion during activation or later sample treatment. It is suggested, however, that a non-equilibrium form of iron such as the sponge structure carries the dominat- ing catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis. It is then quite reasonable that only highly specific recipes in generation, activation and operation of the elemental iron catalyst, which maximise and preserve the meta- stable fraction in the material, can lead to good catalysts.

The heterogeneity of distribution of the promoter oxides was confirmed to exist on all levels of resolution.

An EXAFS experiment on these catalyst particles confirms that all iron structures are made-up from bcc iron unit cells and that the discrimination of the iron species should result from textural rather than from atomic structural differences.
