The Cu-Cr catalysts were treated by heating at 300-900 under oxidizing or reducing atmospfiere. Calcined at 700-900 under oxidizing atmosphere, the formation of Cu2Cr204 spinel structure resulted in an enhanced activity not only for carbon monoxide oxidation but also for propene oxidation. On the other hand, treatment in a reducing atmosphere at 700-900 produced a sintered copper surface but induced a strong metal-support interaction that led to an enhancement in activity, but only for carbon monoxide oxidation. Addition- ally, the synergistic effect resulting from the ligand effect, as Cr203 species is closely associated with CuO species, occurs for carbon monoxide oxidation. The activity of propene oxidation on the CuO catalyst reaches a maximum at a copper content of about 10 wt.-% and that on the Cr203 catalyst reaches a maximum at a chromium content of about 25 wt.-%.

Introduction Base-metal oxide catalysts have been re-evaluated for automotive exhaust treat- ment due to the limited availability of precious metals in recent years, One of the most effective non-precious metal catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation seems to be the copper-chromium combination [ 1,2]. For automotive exhaust treatment, catalysts are required to maintain their activity after exposure to the exhaust at temperatures of 600-1000. Therefore, it is * Corresponding author, tel.

Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73-87 important to examine the possible relations between catalyst structures and their activities for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon oxidation. However, the charac- teristic of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon oxidation on Cu-Cr oxide catalysts with spinel structures is not understood and there is no clear definition of the role of each metal. Laine and co-workers [3,4] proposed that a mechanism of electron transfer between copper and chromium leads to the inhibition of the reduction of the Cu- Cr catalysts and thus copper is the main active species for carbon monoxide oxi- dation. Also, Leech and Campbell [5] found that CuCr204 spinels are relatively active as oxidation catalysts. The role of chromium is to limit the extent of reduction through the formation of CuCr204 phase [2]. Additionally, Fridman et al. [6] found that the enhancement of the dehydrogenation activity is caused by the sta- bilization of the copper species in the CuCr204 spinel. However, Apai et al. [7] observed that the high-temperature heating of the Cu-Cr oxide catalyst enhances the formation of Cu2fr204 at the catalyst surface, which is associated with increased methanol activity based upon normalized surface area. Monnier et al. [ 8 ] suggested that Cu is the active site responsible for carbon monoxide chemisorption over Cu-Cr catalyst. Farrauto et al. [9] reported that the most efficient Cu-Cr catalyst is with a metal composition close to a chromium to copper molar ratio of 1 rather than 2 that corresponds to the stable form of copper chromite, CuCr204. However, there is no clear interpretation for the relation between this optimal composition and its struc- ture. This indicates that the fundamental role of the active component of the catalysts with spinel type in complete oxidation reactions has not yet been sufficiently studied. In this work, the effect of the heat-treatment conditions over the Cu-Cr catalysts was studied to examine the relations between the catalyst structure and its activity for carbon monoxide and propene oxidation. On the other hand, Huang and co-workers [ 10,11 ] reported that heat treatment at 800 in a reducing atmosphere produces a sintered copper surface but induces a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) that causes a considerably enhanced activity of carbon monoxide oxidation over CuO/alumina catalyst. As temperatures higher than 800 may be encountered in automobile emissions, further investi- gation was needed and this was also carried out in this study to see whether a similar feature is at work over the Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts. In this work, heat treatments at different gaseous atmosphere (oxidizing or reducing) and temperature (300-900) were carried out to induce a large variation in the surface properties of the Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts. The effect of these heat- treatment conditions was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-pro- grammed reduction (TPR) and activity measurement for carbon monoxide and propene oxidation. C.-C. Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73~87 75 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Bohemite-alumina powder (Strem, 200-270 mesh) was used as the support. The total surface area was 235 m2/g before impregnation. The Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts were prepared by coimpregnating the alumina powder with an aqueous solution of copper and chromium nitrates. Following evaporating the excess solution at 65, the paste obtained was dried at 120 for 12 h and then calcined in a flow of 1 1/ min air by increasing the temperature at a rate of 2/min to 500 and it was kept at 500 for 5 h. Van der Grift et al. [ 12] reported that the particle size of supported copper is not affected by reduction treatments up to 600. Therefore, it is believed that calcination at 500 is suitable. Three series of catalysts were prepared: CuO/ alumina, Cr203/alumina and Cu--Cr/alumina with metal content varied between 5.0 and 30 wt.-%. The heat treatment of the catalysts, without any pretreatment after coimpregnat- ing, was carried out at a temperature between 300 and 900 in oxidizing atmosphere (in a flow of air) or in reducing atmosphere (in a flow of 5% hydrogen in argon). The Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst with a metal content of 20 wt.-% and a Cu/ Cr molar ratio of 1 was employed to study the effect of the heat-treatment conditions. 2.2. Catalyst characterization XRD Powder X-ray diffraction spectra were performed over the 20 interval of 5-65 using Cu Ka (A= 1.5418 ]k) radiation. Samples were removed from the reactor after heat treatment under an inert atmosphere at room temperature and taken immediately for XRD measurement. B.E.T. surface area Total surface areas were obtained with a Quantasorb surface area analyzer. All surface areas were derived from one point B.E.T. adsorption isotherms, with nitro- gen at - 195 as the adsorbate. TPR Temperature-programmed reduction was performed by 10% hydrogen in argon with 0.1 grams of catalyst in a conventional TPR set-up. The temperature was increased linearly at 10/min. Before carrying out TPR, the sample that was heat- treated in a reducing atmosphere was reoxidized in a flow of 50 ml/min air by increasing the temperature at a rate of 10/min to 300, at which temperature it was kept 1 h. 76 C.-C.

Activity measurement 0.1 g of catalyst was diluted with 0.1 g of alumina support and then placed in a flow reactor. The reactor was made of quartz tube with an outside diameter of 1.5 cm. For carbon monoxide oxidation, the catalyst bed was heated to the designated temperature and then a gas mixture containing 2% CO (Air Products, 99.9% purity), 2% oxygen and balance nitrogen were led through it at a flow-rate of 500 ml/min. A space velocity of 150 000 h- 1 could be calculated with these conditions. The residence time is thus 0.024 s. The propene oxidation activity was measured in a similar manner except that the reactant gas was a mixture of 8000 ppm propene (Air Products, 99.7% purity) and 4% oxygen in nitrogen in order to keep an oxygen- rich atmosphere. The reaction rate was determined between 150 and 400. All activity results were obtained under steady-state condition. Since catalysis is closely related with surface phenomena, it is very important to measure the metal surface area. The copper surface area is commonly determined by a nitrous oxide pulse method as described by Evans et al. [ 13 ]. Unfortunately, this method cannot be used in this work since nitrous oxide adsorption may also occur on Cr3 + ions as a reversible non-dissociative process and/or an irreversible dissociative process [14]. According to Table 1, high temperature calcination leads to plugged pores, buried copper oxides or chromium oxides and activity loss. Therefore, the specific activity for heat-treatment Cu-Cr catalysts should be referred to B.E.T. surface area instead of mass. The reactant and product gases were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-7A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. And, MS-13X and Porapak Q column was employed for carbon monoxide and propene oxidation reaction, respectively. 3. Results 3.1.

Cu-Cr oxides occurs during heat treatment by increasing the temperature from 300 to 900. According to the decomposition sequence of alumina hydroxides as by Satterfield [ 15 ], y-alumina is formed through the dehydration of bohemite-alumina (A1203\"H20) at the temperature range from 500 to 900. Therefore, the A1203 H20 phase exists only at temperature below 500, as also shown in Fig. 1 a. Some crystalline CuCrO4 species exist, but only with 300 treatment. Fridman et al. [6,16] reported that CuCr204 phase can be observed as an endotherm on DTA (differential thermal analysis) curves at 480 and is associated with the decomposition of CuCrO4 to CuCr204. Jacob et al. [ 17] reported that the decom- position temperature ofCuCrO4 in pure oxygen gas at 1 atm is 480. Also, Horvath and Hanic [ 18 ] found that the transformation of the crystalline CuCrO4 into amor- phous forms (CuO and CuCr204) occurs at a temperature range from 480 to 500. Hence, it is believed that the amorphous phases of CuO and CuCr204 were formed at 500 but not detected by XRD. From Fig. lc and Fig. ld, it is noteworthy that the spinel-like structure of Cu2Cr204 occurred when Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst was treated at 700, and the amount of Cu2Cr204 increased remarkably as the treatment temperature further increased to 900. This result suggests that the major portion of the copper species in the Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst exists in the form of the spinel-like structure as Cu2Cr204. This is in agreement with that in the literature [7,8,19], i.e., the high- temperature heating of Cu-Cr oxide catalysts enhances the formation of Cu2Cr204. Typical XRD patterns for the catalysts treated in a reducing atmosphere are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the amount of crystalline copper increases with increasing heat-treatment temperature. In addition, no spinel-like structure was found. This indicates that copper cannot interact with chromium under these con- ditions. This will be more obviously observed with the TPR profiles in Section 3.2. 3.2. Temperature-programmed reduction Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of the 20 wt.-% Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts treated in an oxidizing atmosphere. It is seen that the treatment temperature significantly 78 C.-C. Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73-87 2 2 b I ! ! J I I I I I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Scan angle(20) Fig. 2.

The large peak as shown in Fig. 3a is assigned to CuCrO4 according to the XRD patterns in Fig. la and a 2.5 H2/Cu ratio of TPR result due to the CuCrO4 reduced to copper and Cr203. According to literature [20-22], the TPR result of CuO/AI203 catalysts exhibits two reduction peak. One is the highly dispersive copper oxide at 200-220, the other is bulk copper oxide at about 250. In addition, Severino and Laine [ 3] found that the reduction temperature of CuO is same as that of CuCr204. Therefore, the peak in Fig. 3b can correspond to a combination of the reduction peak of CuO and that of CuCr204. In Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d, two separate peaks are observed. The first peak is due to the highly dispersive CuO species [20-22] that was undetectable by XRD. The second peak is due to the Cu2Cr204 species according to the XRD patterns in Fig. lc and Fig. ld.

Therefore, it is confirmed that Cu2Cr204 is the major species after the high-temperature treatment under oxidizing conditions. The TPR profiles of the catalysts treated in a reducing atmosphere are shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly observed that only one peak with a shoulder is present in each profile. The reduction temperature of each peak was 200-250. However, the reduction temperatures of the Cu-Cr spinels (CuCrO4, CuCr204, CuzCr204) were higher than 250. Hence, it is indicated that no Cu-Cr spinel structure was formed under reducing conditions. The peaks in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b are attributed to the dispersive CuO according to the XRD patterns in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. Solcova et al. [23 ] found that amorphous or poorly crystalline supports, such as T-A1203, suppress the reducibility of NiO due to the development of the strong bonds between NiO and support [ 24]. Hence, we think that the reduction peak of CuO, as shown in Fig. 4c and 4d, shifting toward a higher temperature is attributed to CuO/A1203 interaction. These results indicate that copper is unable to interact with chromium under the reducing condition and only Cu2 + species was formed after reoxidizing the catalysts treated in a reducing atmosphere. 3.3. Activity measurement Fig. 5 presents the activities of the 20 wt.-% Cu--Cr/alumina catalysts treated in oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. In order to give a better understanding of the surface properties, the activities are expressed as the rate of carbon monoxide consumption per unit total surface area. It is seen that increasing the treatment temperature from 500 to 700 in an oxidizing atmosphere dramatically enhanced the activity for carbon monoxide oxidation. On the other hand, treatment in a reducing atmosphere at higher temperature enhanced the activity only moderately. 80 C.-C.

Effect of heat-treatment conditions on 20 wt.-% Cu-Cr/3,-alumina catalyst for carbon monoxide oxidation activity at 300. (O) catalyst heated in air; (@) catalyst heated in 5% H2. This suggests that the activity is deeply affected by the heat-treatment condition. A suitable catalyst for automotive emission control must be active not only for carbon monoxide but also for hydrocarbon oxidation. For the measurement of hydrocarbon activity, propene is commonly employed to represent the overall hydrocarbons in automotive exhaust. The activities for propene oxidation are shown in Fig. 6. It is seen that the activity increases dramatically with increasing heat- treatment temperature in the oxidizing atmosphere. However, the activity remains almost the same with treatments in reducing atmosphere. In order to understand the role of the active component in Cu-Cr catalyst for oxidation, y-alumina supported CuO and Cr203 catalysts were employed. The effect of metal content on carbon monoxide oxidation is shown in Fig. 7. The activities of the CuO catalysts show a maximum at a copper content of about 10 wt.-%. Severino et al. [ 2 ] observed a maximum activity for carbon monoxide oxidation at around 7.5 wt.-% copper on CuO/y-alumina catalyst prepared by impregnating 3 I 0 i i J 200 400 600 O00 I000 Treatment temperature() Fig. 6.

The difference is attributed to the variation of the B.E.T. surface area of y-alumina. On the other hand, the Cr203 catalyst is almost inactive for carbon monoxide oxidation. How- ever, Cr203 could act as a promoter of the CuO catalyst for carbon monoxide oxidation, as also shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 shows that both CuO and Cr203 catalysts are active for propene oxidation. The activities of the CuO catalysts also show a maximum at a copper content of about 10 wt.-%, while the maximum activity on Cr203 catalyst is observed at a metal content of about 25 wt.-%. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of heat-treatment conditions The effect of heat-treatment conditions on Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts for carbon monoxide and propene oxidation is studied with the above-mentioned results of 82 C.-C. Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73-87 XRD and TPR. These results clearly demonstrate that the catalyst possesses a high activity due to the formation of the spinel-like phase of Cu2Cr204 during the high- temperature treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere. This is a beneficial effect on copper catalysts to modify the detrimental effect of sintering at high temperatures for automotive emission control. Huang and Yu [ 11] found that high temperature (800) treatment in an oxi- dizing atmosphere led to a redispersed copper surface but a dramatically reduced activity of carbon monoxide oxidation over copper/y-alumina catalysts. In that case, only Cu2 + existed on the surface and the inactive phase of CuA1204 is the cause for a lower activity. Friedman and Freeman [ 25 ] reported that saturation of alumina with copper formed the aluminate at a concentration of about 4 wt.-% for each 100 m2/g alumina surface. Therefore, in the present case of alumina supported 20 wt.-% Cu-Cr oxide, it is expected that most copper species are available to interact with chromium and the high-activity spinel is formed. Murthy et al. [26] investigated the reactivity in the spinel formation in CuO/ A1203\" Fe203\" Cr203 systems. They observed that the distorted tetrahedral and octahedral of oxide ions surrounding Cu2ions give rise to products (CuCr204 and CuFe204) with high defect structure that increases the reactivity of these spinel formation reactions, but the reactivity of CuA1204 is considerably low. Addition- ally, the Cu ion is associated with the Cu2fr204 spinel structure that is a stable phase under the reaction condition. It is well known and also shown in Fig. 7 that copper is the main active species for carbon monoxide oxidation on Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts [2-4,27]. The mech- anism of carbon monoxide oxidation over copper catalyst is considered as a Lang- muir-Hinshelwood type surface reaction and the kinetics is close to first order in carbon monoxide and zero order in oxygen [ 28 ]. In other words, carbon monoxide shows weak adsorption in comparison with oxygen over copper catalysts. In order to enhance the activity for carbon monoxide oxidation, the catalysts needs stronger adsorption of carbon monoxide. Doshi et al. [ 29 ] reported that p-type conducting materials were found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for carbon monoxide oxidation. Considering the chemisorptive character of carbon monoxide, it prefers to absorb on p-type semiconducting oxide [ 29,30] due to the lone pair of electrons on carbon, which has a high degree of p character and results in a donor-type chemisorptive behavior [31 ]. Accordingly, the p-type semiconducting oxide, which can supply the electron holes, will give a high activity for the donor-type reaction of carbon monoxide. Since Cu20 was classified to be a p-type semicon- ductor [32] with a stronger carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity than CuO [33,34], it is reasonable that Cu+ is more active than Cu2+ for carbon monoxide oxidation [ 8,35 ]. Monnier et al. [ 8 ] revealed that the concentration of surface Cu + (CuzCr204) depends on the calcination temperature and an enhancement of the formation of Cu~Cr204, the thermodynamically stable phase, is observed if high- temperature calcination is used. C.-C. Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73--87 83 It is concluded that the high-activity spinel phase of Cu2Cr204 is formed due to high-temperature treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, the excess amount of Cu2Cr204 phase cannot enhance the activity as shown in Fig. 5. Severino et al. [ 2 ] found that the optimum catalyst concentration corresponds to a chromium to copper molar ratio between 1 and 2. This indicates that an association of Cut, CuCr204 and Cu2Cr204 is the most effective for carbon monoxide oxidation. On the other hand, for propene oxidation, the active species is not only copper but also chromium, as shown in Fig. 8. A mechanism of propene oxidation over Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst as proposed by Hertl and Farrauto [ 36] states that adsorbed propene transforms to a unidentate carbonate group and liberates water vapor. In the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the reaction rate thus increases with increasing propene chemisorption. It is inferred that the capacity of propene chemisorption thus increases with the heat-treatment temperature due to the phase transformation from CuCrO4 to CuCr204 or Cu2Cr204. In other words, the activity of propene oxidation over Cu- Cr/alumina catalysts therefore increases with increasing heat-treatment tempera- ture in an oxidizing atmosphere. The results as shown in Fig. 6 are consistent with this inference. A similar result was observed by Apai et al. [ 7 ] that high-temperature heating of Cu-Cr oxide catalysts enhances the formation of Cu2Cr204 at the catalyst surface, which was associated with an increased methanol activity based on the normalized surface area. In contrast, no spinel-like structure was found on the Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst with heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere and copper existed only in the Cu2 + form after reoxidation according to the results of XRD and TPR as mentioned above. Chen and Lin [ 27 ] revealed that high-temperature reduction would produce a condition of high electron density on a Cr203 surface. This electron-rich surface of Cr203 destroys the promotion ability of Cr203 toward copper catalyst and the Cu/Cr203 catalyst behaves simply as a copper catalyst. Therefore, the activity of carbon monoxide and propene oxidation over the Cu-Cr catalyst treated in a reduc- ing atmosphere cannot vary as much as that in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, some increase of the carbon monoxide oxidation activity was observed and this is attributed to the SMSI effect as illustrated in Section 4.2. 4.2. Strong metal-support interaction effect Metal-support interaction in catalytic reactions over supported metal catalysts has received considerable attention over the past years. Strong metal-support inter- action (SMSI) is investigated mostly on Group VIII metals supported on reducible metal oxides (e.g., Tit2) [37]. The interaction was considerable due to an elec- tronic effect resulting from the reducibility of the supports, though SMSI also occurs on non-reducible metal oxide. Sanchez and Gazquez [ 38] and Shpiro et al. [ 39] reported that SMSI is due to the oxygen vacancy of the support, which causes a geometric effect that can affect the dispersion and alter the morphology of the 84 C.-C. Chien et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73-87 a~ Q 0 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 i i i 200 400 600 800 1000 Treatment temperature() Fig. 9.

(O) Carbon monoxide oxidation; (O) propene oxidation. supported metal. In addition, high-temperature calcination in a reducing atmosphere may also induce a strong metal-support interaction [ 10,40-42]. The SMSI effect usually leads to an increased peak temperature in the TPR process [40,41]. The activity ratios for carbon monoxide oxidation and propene oxidation as shown in Fig. 9 are obtained from Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. It is seen that high-temperature treatment in a reducing atmosphere causes a large increase in activity for carbon monoxide oxidation. As seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, no Cu-Cr spinel structure is formed with heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere. In addition, an interaction between copper and alumina that causes the reduction of CuO to be difficult is observed in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d. Nevertheless, a sintered copper surface was pro- duced as seen from the enhanced intensity of copper in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d. Rob- inson and Mol [43] found that a higher specific activity for methanol synthesis occurs over the catalyst with a lower dispersion and concluded that this higher activity is induced by an SMSI effect. Huang and co-workers [ 10,11 ] reported that heat treatment at 800 in a reducing atmosphere produces a sintered copper surface but induces an SMSI effect that causes a largely enhanced activity of carbon monoxide oxidation over CuO/alumina catalyst. Foger [42] suggested that a gen- eral feature of metals in the SMSI state is an enhanced activity for reactions involving carbon monoxide, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanation and the CO-NO reaction. The SMSI effect thus occurs over Cu-Cr/alumina catalyst treated in a reducing atmosphere but only for carbon monoxide oxidation. It is concluded that an SMSI effect is responsible for the high activity of Cu- Cr/alumina catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation and this effect is induced by the high-temperature reducing treatment. Additionally, this SMSI effect was stronger when the treatment temperature was higher. 4.3. Synergistic effect A synergistic effect, i.e., the association of CuO with Cr203 leading to a higher carbon monoxide conversion than the sum of conversions on both the CuO and the C.-C. Chien et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 73-87 85 Cr203 catalysts, is clearly observed from the results as shown in Fig. 7. This phenomenon is accounted for by the electronic interaction between copper and chromium. Bijsterbosch et al. [34] reported that the observed frequency shift of 10 cm-J for the Cu+-CO band is an indication that there exists electronic inter- action between CuO and Cr203 in a mixed oxidic phase. The electrical transport within the catalyst is important in the determination of the relationship between electronic structures and catalytic properties of semicon- ductors. Tiwari [44] found that the electrical conduction in Cu-Cr catalyst results from the jumping of electrons from a Cudefect to the Cu2+ normal sites at temperatures above 283. The combination of copper oxide and chromium oxide thus creates a synergistic ligand effect due to electronic interactions between copper and chromium, i.e., chromium acts as an electronic promoter of the copper catalyst for carbon monoxide oxidation. On the other hand, the synergistic effect occurs more obviously at lower metal content, as also shown in Fig. 7. Bijsterbosch et al. [34] found that the Cu-Cr mixed oxide catalyst contains loosely bound oxygen at the surface. They elucidated that the Cu-Cr oxide catalyst has a higher dispersion as compared with CuO and Cr203 catalysts due to the presence of a mixed oxidic phase. It is well known [ 27 ] that the dispersion of copper will decrease due to the formation of bulk oxides such as CuO, Cr203 or Cufr204 when the metal content increases. The occurrence of the synergistic effect is expected to come from the situation when Cr203 species is closely associated with CuO species [45]; the effect thus decreases as the metal content increases. In other words, chromium acts not only as an electronic promoter but also as a textural promoter of the copper catalyst for carbon monoxide oxidation. Therefore, it is concluded that the synergistic effect resulting from the ligand effect, as Cr203 species is closely associated with CuO species, occurs over the Cu-Cr/alumina catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation. 4.4. Effect of metal content Arlow and Wooddruff [46] observed that a structural sensitivity exists for carbon monoxide oxidation because the highest reaction rate occurs on the copper surface containing both steps and low-index terraces. This indicates that the major active sites are located at the interface that contains a large number of surface defects due to the interaction between support and active species. The number of active sites thus increases with the metal content and reaches a maximum. When further increas- ing the metal content, the number of active sites decreases due to the interface being covered by the bulk metal oxide. According to the classification of structure-sensitive reaction, propene oxidation belongs to this group [ 15 ]. Thus, the activity of propene oxidation over the CuO/ y-alumina catalyst also reaches a maximum and this is at a copper content of about 10 wt.-%, similar to that for carbon monoxide oxidation, but at a chromium content of about 25 wt.-%, as shown in Fig. 8. 86 C.-C. Chien et al./ Applied Catalysis A.\" General 131 (1995) 73-87 The temperature at which lattices begin to be appreciably mobile is sometimes termed the Tammann temperature [ 15 ]. With our calcination temperature of 500, near the Tammann temperature of CuO but far from that of Cr203, the sintering of the CuO catalyst is easier than that of the Cr203 catalysts for a higher loading. This is the reason that the activity of propene oxidation on the Cr203 catalyst reaches a maximum at a higher metal content than that on CuO. 5. Conclusion The Cu-Cr/y-alumina catalyst was demonstrated to have enhanced activity not only for carbon monoxide oxidation but also for propene when it was calcined at 700-900 under an oxidizing atmosphere. The enhanced activity resulted from the formation of Cu2Cr204 spinel structure that was detected with XRD and TPR. On the other hand, treatment in a reducing atmosphere at 700-900 resulted in a sintered copper surface but induced a strong metal-support interaction that led to an enhancement in activity, but only for carbon monoxide oxidation. Additionally, the synergistic effect resulting from the ligand effect, as Cr203 species is closely associated with CuO species, occurs for carbon monoxide oxidation. The activity of propene oxidation on the CuO catalyst reaches a maximum at a copper content of about 10 wt.-% and that on the Cr203 catalyst reaches a maximum at a chromium content of about 25 wt.-%.

The activity behavior of carbon monoxide and propene oxidation on CuCr catalysts was investigated by varying both the catalyst composition and the heat-treatment conditions. γ-Alumina supported CuO, Cr2O3 and CuCr oxide catalysts were employed. The CuCr catalysts were treated by heating at 300–900°C under oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. Calcined at 700–900°C under oxidizing atmosphere, the formation of Cu2Cr2O4 spinel structure resulted in an enhanced activity not only for carbon monoxide oxidation but also for propene oxidation. On the other hand, treatment in a reducing atmosphere at 700–900°C produced a sintered copper surface but induced a strong metal-support interaction that led to an enhancement in activity, but only for carbon monoxide oxidation. Additionally, the synergistic effect resulting from the ligand effect, as Cr2O3 species is closely associated with CuO species, occurs for carbon monoxide oxidation. The activity of propene oxidation on the CuO catalyst reaches a maximum at a copper content of about 10 wt.-% and that on the Cr2O3 catalyst reaches a maximum at a chromium content of about 25 wt.-%.
