Keywords CAL-B Enantioselective biotransformations Tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidines Therapeutic agents 1 Introduction The 2,4-disubstituted tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidine (THPP, Fig. 1 ) is a chemical scaffold with increasingly important biological and pharmacological activities. A broad number of THPP-derivatives have found use as modulators of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) with potential to deliver agents to treat osteoporosis (CaSR antagonists) [1], or to prevent and treat viral infections and diseases, especially those caused by hepatitis C virus [2]. Remarkably, in addition to these uses, hits from these chemical series active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been recently identified in several phenotypic screenings [3], and medicinal chemistry approaches have yielded promising structures with in vivo anti-tubercular properties [4]. In the chemical synthesis of THPP series, hydrogenation of the pyrimidine ring leads to a racemic mixture of cis-enantiomers (Scheme 1 ). Whereas in the case of THPPs as CaSR antagonists the (R)-enantiomer displays 10-fold higher pharmacological activity than the (S)-enantiomer [1a], in the case of hepatitis C inhibitors (5S,7R)-isomers are the active form [2] and as TB inhibitors the (5R,7S)-THPPs are at least two orders of magnitude more active than the (5S,7R)-compounds [4]. Furthermore, the regulations of enantiopurity applied by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for novel pharmaceuticals [5] force to the development of optically active THPPs for its further therapeutic use and commercialization. Herein, preparative chiral HPLC has been always industrially used for the separation of these enantiomers, regardless of the final medical application (Scheme 1). Albeit effective, such chromatographic techniques may involve tedious and time-consuming processes, while contributing significantly to solvent consumption and waste formation. Actually, solvents account for 80% of material use and waste production in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [6]. Conclusively, due to the emerging importance of THPPs as therapeutic agents, the set-up of more environmentally friendly and practically oriented strategies in the production of optically active THPPs would be highly desirable. To our knowledge, asymmetric catalysis – in its broadest sense – has never been assessed for the chirality generation/resolution in THPPs. Among the catalytic strategies for asymmetric synthesis, biotransformations have emerged in the last decades as a powerful and economically attractive option for the provision of optically active drugs and building blocks, under mild and environmentally friendly conditions [7]. Typically, enzymes are introduced as the core step for the chirality generation/resolution within a multi-step synthetic protocol. A recent relevant example is the industrial implementation of a transaminase-catalyzed process for the sitagliptin synthesis. In this case, a combination of a cosolvent (DMSO) to solubilize the substrate in the aqueous solution, together with an engineered enzyme variant, led to great results both in activity and enantiomeric excess [8a,b]. Likewise, that example shows the tremendous potential that biocatalysis may have for pharmaceuticals, starting from an inefficient wild-type enzyme, and ending up with a robust industrial process, once reaction set-up and protein engineering are judiciously aligned [7a,8]. Although some outstanding examples of enzymes being used at industrial scale have been described [8], the number of applications of biocatalysis to industrially interesting substrates remains to be low for its envisaged potential. Within a lead optimization program of THPPs as antitubercular agents [3a,4a,c], we considered the relevance of applying biocatalysis for the synthesis of optically active THPPs. Following these considerations, in this work the biocatalytic kinetic resolution of optically active THPPs is reported for the first time. To this end, hydrolases were assessed to perform the kinetic resolution of the formed racemic esters in aqueous solutions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Enzymes were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, Enzagen (Cambridge, United Kingdom) or kindly donated by Novozymes (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and c-LEcta (Lepzig, Germany). 2.2 Analytics Achiral UPLC–MS analysis was performed using an Acquity BEH-C18 1.7μm 2.1×50mm column (Waters), in a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters) coupled to an API 2000 Q-Trap (Applied Biosystems). Mobile phase ACN, 0.1% formic acid. Chiral HPLC analyses were performed in a Chiralpak IC column 4.6×250mm (Chiral Technologies Europe Cedex, France) in a HPLC 1200 from Agilent (Boeblingen, Germany), using different mixtures of hexane, ethyl acetate and TFA as mobile phases. 2.3 Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) synthesis Choline chloride and hydrogen-bond-donors (HBD) were mixed in different equimolar ratios and gently stirred and heated up to 80°C, until the DES was formed (30–90min). The water content of the DESs was determined by Karl Fischer titration at 20°C, and was typically found between 0.5 and 1.0% (w/w). 2.4 Activity screening The hydrolytic activity of a battery of 50 enzyme preparations against substrate 1a was tested under screening conditions: 300μL of a 2.5μM solution of 1a in PBS (phosphate buffer saline, 10mM, pH 7.4). Reactions were stirred at 30°C and 1000rpm in a Thermomixer for 48h. After this time, 100μL sample were taken and mixed with 150μL precipitating agent (methanol:aceonitile, 3:1, 1μM Resorufin as internal standard) and 50μL 0.1% formic acid in 96-well microtiter plates. Plates were centrifuged at 3700rpm and 10°C for 15min and reactions were analyzed by UPLC–MS. 2.5 Enzymatic hydrolysis in analytic scale To a reaction mixture of 2.5μM 1a in 800μL PBS (phosphate buffer saline, 10mM, pH 7.4), 20μg enzyme preparation was added (PLE, ERL or CAL-B). Reactions were incubated at 30°C and 1000rpm in a Thermomixer (Fischer, Germany). At periodic time points 100μL samples were withdrawn and mixed with 150μL precipitating agent (methanol:aceonitile, 3:1, 1μM Resorufin as internal standard) and 50μL 0.1% formic acid in 96-well microtiter plates. Plates were centrifugated at 3700rpm and 10°C for 15min and reactions were analyzed by UPLC–MS. 2.6 General procedure for CAL-B-catalyzed kinetic resolutions 2–4mg substrate and the correspondent amount of cosolvent (200μL DMSO in standard reactions, other cosolvents and amounts in optimization experiments) was added and stirred at 30°C for 5–10min. Sodium phosphate buffer (100mM, pH 7.4) was added to form a 5mM solution of substrate and mixed for 20–30min. The reaction was started with addition of 400μL liquid enzyme preparation (equivalent to 2mg protein). Aliquots of 500μL were taken after 24 and 48h, acidified with 20μL HCl 1N, and extracted three times with 500μL ethyl acetate. The organic phases were collected and evaporated, the mixture was re-suspended in 100μL methanol and substrate/product concentration and optical purity was analyzed by chiral HPLC-UV (254nm) using hexane:ethanol:TFA 90:10:0.1 as mobile phase for compounds 1a–1b, and 95:5:0.1 for compounds 2a–2b and 3a–3b. Conversion and E values were then calculated from the enantiomeric excesses from substrate and product following equations reported in the literature [9]. 2.7 General procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydropyrazolopyrimidine derivatives 1a–3a Ethyl esters of THPPs 1a–3a were synthesized as previously described [1]. For the synthesis of compound 1a, a mixture of ethyl 3-aminopyrazole-4-carboxylate (0.635g, 4.090mmol) and 1-(4-ethyl-phenyl)-4,4,4-trifluoro-butane-1,3-dione (1g, 4.090mmol) in AcOH (10mL) was heated under reflux for 6h. After cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was poured onto ice (60g). The solid formed was filtered off, triturated with hexane and dried to afford a pale yellow solid (950mg, 2.61mmol, 64%). This intermediate was resuspended (480mg, 1.321mmol) in dry MeOH (11mL) and sodium borohydride (175mg, 4.620mmol) was added in 4 portions at room temperature. The reaction was stirred for 5h and followed by LC–MS. When completion of the reaction was observed, the reaction was quenched with saturated citric acid solution, concentrated in vacuo and extracted with EtOAc (3×10mL). The organic solution was washed with aqueous NaHCO3 solution, water and brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to afford 1a as a pale yellow solid (452mg, 1.23mmol, 93%). 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 7.74 (s, 1H), 7.36 (d, J =8.3Hz, 2H), 7.25 (d, J =8.3Hz, 2H), 6.12 (bs, 1H), 4.87–4.81 (m, 1H), 4.55 (dd, J =2.5 and 11.6Hz, 1H), 4.28–4.22 (m, 2H), 2.68 (q, J =7.8Hz, 2H), 2.57–2.51 (m, 1H), 2.41–2.32 (m, 1H), 1.32 (t, J =7.1Hz, 3H), 1.26 (t, J =7.6Hz, 3H).

Given the envisaged synthetic approach to obtain the substrates, whereby esters were the obtained products (Scheme 1), hydrolytic reactions using lipases and esterases in aqueous buffer were set to probe biocatalysis. From a screening of 50 commercially available lipases and esterases (detailed list provided in Supplementary Information) using substrate 1a, only three active hits were found, pig and rabbit liver esterase (PLE and ERL), and Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B). The low hit rate of active enzymes is likely attributed to the bulky substrate employed. The use of PLE and ERL – mixture of different isoenzymes displaying different enantioselectivities – virtually led to full conversions of the ester (100%) with poor or negligible enantiomeric excess [11]. Conversely, CAL-B afforded 50% conversion, and the reaction stopped at that point, suggesting a high enantioselectivity for the THPP used as prototypical substrate (Fig. 2 ). Encouraged by the results achieved with CAL-B under the screening conditions reported (Fig. 2), that enzyme was selected for a more in-depth assessment of biocatalysis in THPPs. To this end, different THPP analogues based on structure–activity relationships (SAR) were selected, by changing the nature of the phenyl ring, aiming at improving physico-chemical and developability features. Conversions and enantioselectivities were measured, and results are summarized in Table 1 . The use of CAL-B led to the formation of the desired optically active drugs under very mild hydrolytic conditions (24h, 30°C). In all cases moderate-to-full conversions (for a kinetic resolution) were achieved, with high enantiomeric excesses in all cases. Albeit the overall productivities achieved are in the range of ∼1gL−1 d−1, still far from industrially sound conditions [12], the enzymatic resolution of this highly valuable scaffold with both asymmetric centres far from the catalytic centre has been achieved, which is a remarkable and underexplored fact for biocatalysis. The addition of a cosolvent (10% DMSO) to the buffer enabled the dissolution of both substrates and products. Yet, envisaging future real process set-up conditions, the use of DMSO often leads to problems during work-up procedure, with the generation of considerable amounts of wastewater and consequent yield losses and environmental challenges [13]. Aiming at providing more practical solutions combining ecology for pharmaceutical industries, in recent years the use of bio-based cosolvents, such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) [13b,14], or tert-butanol [15], have been suggested for enzymatic reactions. In addition, the use of ionic liquids and deep-eutectic-solvents (DES) as cosolvents have been put forth as well for several enzymatic catalytic systems by different research groups [16]. To further assess the enzymatic kinetic resolution of THPPs and aiming to improve substrate solubility, a broad screening of co-solvents was conducted (Fig. 3 ). Our screening revealed that apart from DMSO other cosolvents enabling a more straightforward work-up (e.g. distillation) and/or a potentially biogenic origin (2-MeTHF, tert-butanol and different DES) could also be satisfactorily used in the lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of THPPs. 2-MeTHF did not dissolve the substrate in the conditions applied, what may explain the lower enzymatic activity observed, compared to other more successful lipase-catalyzed processes reported in the literature for 2-MeTHF [14,17]. Remarkably the use of DES as cosolvents (10% in buffer) led to promising results in hydrolytic reactions, with comparable outcomes to those of DMSO (Fig. 3). Albeit DES did not fully dissolve the substrate satisfactorily at those conditions, and furthermore, it would be expected that the DES structure would be disaggregated under aqueous solutions, it appears that some beneficial effect may be found for hydrolytic enzymatic reactions. Analogous improved results for DES as cosolvents have also been reported for other enzymes (epoxide hydrolases, cellulases) [18], as well as for proteases in DES-containing water solutions [19]. Overall, the use of more environmentally friendly and easy-to-handle cosolvents (compared to DMSO) results compatible with the kinetic resolution of THPPs. 4 Conclusion This work has successfully explored for the first time the use of biocatalysis for the kinetic resolution of different tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidines (THPPs), structures that are having an increasingly importance as therapeutic agents (e.g. as agents to treat osteoporosis, as antivirals and as anti-tuberculars) whose enantiomeric centres are located far away from the carbonyl moiety. After screening a number of commercially available hydrolases, CAL-B was selected as the biocatalyst to undertake enantioselective hydrolysis using DMSO as cosolvent, with excellent enantiomeric excesses and conversions. Moreover, envisaging a further real use of the process, different easy-to-handle and (preferentially) bio-based cosolvents were tested. Herein, tert-butanol and aqueous solutions of different deep-eutectic-solvents (DES) appear promising for this specific case. Looking beyond, to convert this preliminary proof-of-concept into a robust industrial process, considerable improvements must be made, especially in delivering genetically improved enzyme variants that may perform this challenging transformation in reduced reaction times [8]. Being the first example of asymmetric catalysis in THPP synthesis – and given its foreseeable future importance for many therapeutic areas – it may be expected that improved (bio)catalytic performances will be disclosed in the coming years.
