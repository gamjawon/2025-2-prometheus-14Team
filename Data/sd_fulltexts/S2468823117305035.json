Graphical abstract Manganese mixed oxides with the compositions Mn-Mg-Al-O and Mn-O were synthesized by the self-combustion method. The effects of Mg and Al incorporation on the structural, textural, redox and catalytic properties of the manganese oxides were evaluated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, temperature-programed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), oxygen storage capacity (OSC), 18O/16O oxygen isotope exchange, and their catalytic performance was evaluated in the oxidation of toluene, ethyl acetate and 2-propanol. The analyses showed that the use of a glycine/nitrate ratio equal to 0.56 in the self-combustion favors the formation of the Mn3O4 phase and the incorporation of Mg and Al into the structure stabilizes this phase after a thermal process. In addition, the surface area increases, the particle size decreases, and the presence of electrophilic oxygens is favored, which increases the adsorption sites, exposes the active centers and facilitates the occurrence of redox cycles, leading to a better catalytic performance in the total conversion of the oxygenated compounds on the Mn-Mg-Al-O mixed oxide. In the oxide that only contains manganese, the presence of nucleophilic oxygens with great mobility was observed, leading to its good activity in the oxidation of the VOCs. The catalytic tests showed that a high oxygen exchange capacity leads to lower temperatures of conversion of toluene, which suggests that, for the oxidation of aromatic compounds, the lattice oxygen plays a fundamental role in the catalytic activity. In contrast, in the oxidation of oxygenated compounds that require lower temperatures of conversion, the existence of surface oxygens such as O2 − and O− favors the catalytic process and therefore ensures superior activity in the transformation of ethyl acetate and 2-propanol on the Mn-Mg-Al-O mixed oxide. Keywords Self-combustion Mixed oxide Oxygen mobility Oxygen storage 1 Introduction Manganese oxides are among the most active catalysts in the oxidation of VOCs and show high efficiency in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, toluene, ethanol and other catalytic oxidation processes [1–3]. Their catalytic properties are attributed to the ability of the metal to form oxides with different oxidation states, Mn2+/Mn3+ or Mn3+/Mn4+and to the participation of the lattice oxygens in the catalytic process through a Mars Van Krevelen mechanism [4]. Generally, the oxide mixture presents better physico-chemical and catalytic properties than the individual oxides due to cooperative effects between the elements and changes in the structural or redox properties. Thus, the mixed oxides from hydrotalcite-type precursors consisting of Mg-Al-M (M: Mn, Co, Cu, Fe) are active catalysts in the oxidation of different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) thanks to the unique properties of these oxides, such as high surface area, good thermal stability, good redox properties, homogeneous dispersion of the elements and basic properties, among others [5–8]. Hydrotalcites present a laminar structure formed by Mg2+ and Al3+ ions that can be substituted by divalent or trivalent cations, producing materials with different compositions [9]. Generally, the formation of hydrotalcites as oxide precursors proceeds through co-precipitation which usually requires prolonged times and the need to separate the product after the precipitation. Thus, self-combustion is an interesting, versatile and accessible method for obtaining mixed oxides because is possible to directly generate the oxides in much shorter synthesis times without the need to form precursors. Self-combustion is an oxidation-reduction reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer. It generates mixed oxides with great potential in reactions of catalytic interest, since the intimate mixture between the constituents of the reaction and the rapid evolution of gaseous products during the combustion dissipate heat, limit the temperature increase and inhibit particle size growth, allowing the formation of final materials rich in defects with well-dispersed active phases and highly porous structures [10]. In this work, manganese oxides were synthesized using self-combustion as the synthesis method. One of the oxides was prepared maintaining a composition similar to that obtained when using hydrotalcite-type precursors (Mg+Mn/Al), while the other solid corresponds to an oxide of manganese alone. The characteristics of these catalysts were compared to evaluate the effect of the presence and absence of Mg and Al on the structural, textural and redox properties, as well as the oxygen species and their mobility in the catalysts. In addition, the catalytic potential of the solids in the total oxidation of three VOCs of different nature was studied. The interest in the transformation of these organic compounds is because these substances come from industrial processes, mobile sources or household products and are considered to be among the most polluting substances in the atmosphere due to their high vapor pressure and easy evaporation at room temperature [11]. In addition, to determine whether the self-combustion method allows for the obtaining of materials with characteristics that are appropriate to obtain catalysts for the oxidation of VOCs, a manganese oxide was synthesized and characterized by thermal decomposition, and its properties were compared with those of the oxides synthesized by self-combustion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst synthesis For the synthesis of the oxides, nitrate solutions of Mg(NO3)2, Al(NO3)3 and Mn(NO3)2 were used as oxidizing agents and a solution of glycine [CH2NH2COOH] as fuel. A fuel/oxidant stoichiometric ratio of 0.56 was used in all cases, which is the ratio that leads the best redox and catalytic properties on manganese oxides [12]. For the mixed oxides containing Mg-Al and Mg-Al-Mn, molar ratios of M2+/M3+ =3 and Mn2+/Mg2+ =1 were maintained. The oxides were obtained by the addition of the respective nitrates to glycine, maintaining constant agitation. The resulting solution was evaporated slowly until a gel was obtained, which was heated to approximately 100°C (∼10min). Once the ignition reaction was reached (∼3min), a powder was obtained and calcined at 500°C for 4h to remove remaining carbonaceous residues and finally obtain the oxides; OMn, corresponds to the manganese oxide that contains only manganese; OMgAl, consists of Mg-Al; and OMnMgAl, contains Mn-Mg-Al. The general reaction between manganese nitrate and glycine, assuming only the generation of CO2, H2O, N2 and the respective manganese oxide, can be described as follows: Mn(NO3)2 +10/9 CH2NH2COOH+1.5/9O2 →1/3 Mn3O4 +20/9 CO2 +25/9H2O+14/9N2 In comparison a manganese oxide MnOx was synthesized by means of the decomposition of Mn(NO3)2 at 500°C for 4h. 2.2 Characterization The X-ray patterns were collected in a Panalytical X’Pert PRO MPD diffractometer equipped with a copper anode (λ=1.5406Å), using a speed of 1°θmin−1 and a step size of 0.02°θ. The diffraction patterns were identified by comparison with the JCPDS (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards) database. To determine the specific area, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model and a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument were used. The samples were degassed at 350°C for 4h, and the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196°C were then obtained. The temperatura –programmed characterizations (H2-TPR and O2-TPD) were conducted in a CHEMBET 3000 QUANTACHROME device equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. For O2-TPD, the mixed oxides (0.100g) were degassed at 400°C for 1h in the presence of He. The adsorption of O2 (9.99% O2 in He) was performed at 400°C and at room temperature, under the same atmosphere for 1h for each temperature. A He flow of 50mLmin−1 was used to remove the excess O2, and finally, the O2 desorption was carried out by increasing the temperature at a heating rate of 10°C/min up to 900°C. For the H2-TPR, the mixed oxides (100mg) were degassed at 400°C under a flow of 50mLmin−1 of N2 and reduced under a flow of 30mLmin−1 of H2/Ar (10% v/v) with a heating ramp-up of 10°C/min. In the determination of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of mixed oxides, 0.015g of catalyst in 0.100g of SiC was pre-oxidized under an air flow of 10mLmin−1 (21% O2) at 400°C for 1h and subsequently purged with argon until 32O2 was not detected. For the analyses, the temperature was maintained at 400°C and the Ar flow at 10mLmin−1, and successive pulses of 50μL of H2 (99.99%) were injected until the samples were saturated, followed by successive pulses of 50μL of O2 (15.2% in He) to re-oxidize the solid until no O2 consumption was observed. The concentrations of the output gases H2, O2, H2O, Ar and He were monitored by mass spectrometry (OmniStar mass spectrometer) following the signals m/z =2, 32, 18, 40 and 4, respectively. The OSC was calculated based on the amount of oxygen consumed during the re-oxidation stage after the H2 pulses and expressed in terms of μmol O2 g−1 of catalysts. The OriginPro 8.5 software was used to quantify the areas of each of the pulses associated with the O2 signal. In the 18O/16O isotope exchange analyses, the samples (0.015g with 0.100g of SiC) were treated under a flow of air (10mLmin−1) at 400°C for 1h. After pretreatment, the sample was left to cool to 200°C under a flow of argon. Pulses of 20μmLof 18O2 were injected into the samples at 200, 260, 350 and 400°C (one pulse at each temperature) in the presence of an argon flow of 10mLmin−1. The composition of the output gas was monitored by mass spectrometry (Omnistar mass spectrometer) following the signals m/z =36, 34 and 32, corresponding to 18O2, 18O 16O and 16O2, respectively. The OriginPro 8.5 software was used to quantify the areas under the signals of the mentioned species. In the catalytic evaluation, a fixed-bed reactor that operates at atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range from 400 to 100°C was used. The samples (0.200g sieved <250μm) were pretreated in an air flow (21% O2) at 400°C for 1h. The conversion curves were obtained by cooling at 1.5°C/min from 400 to 100°C while maintaining a total flow of 280mLmin−1 of air with the VOC to be treated (600ppm of toluene, 1000ppm of ethyl acetate or 1000ppm of 2-propanol). The reactants and products of the oxidation of toluene and ethyl acetate were analyzed in line using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph, and the production of CO2 was analyzed using a Bacharach Model 3150 CO2 analyzer equipped with an IR detector. The oxidation reaction of 2-propanol was monitored by mass spectrometry (Balzers OmniStar mass spectrometer) following the signals m/z =45, 43, 41, 18 and 44, assigned to 2-propanol, acetone, propene, water and carbon dioxide, respectively. The conversion of the VOCs was calculated following the reaction stoichiometry and using the following expressions: % C o n v e r s i o n = [ V O C ] i n p u t − [ V O C ] o u t p u t [ V O C ] i n p u t * 100 % C o n v e r s i o n t o C O 2 = [ C O 2 ] o u t p u t x * [ V O C ] i n p u t * 100 where x is equal to 7 for toluene, 4 for ethyl acetate and 3 for 2-propanol. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and textural properties The XRD profiles of the manganese oxides before and after the calcination process at 500°C and the mixed oxide that does not contain manganese (OMgAl) are shown in Fig. 1 . For OMgAl, the presence of the MgO periclase phase (JCPDS 45-0946) is observed without the formation of species such as Al2O3, suggesting that Al forms part of the Mg crystal lattice, as reported for such systems with a Mg/Al ratio=3.0 [13]. The formation of a periclase-type Mg-Al solid solution is possible due to the lower energy required to form the Mg-O bonds, compared with the energy required to form the Al-O bonds (363.2kJ/mol and 511kJ/mol, respectively), which allows the initial formation of a Mg2+–O2− network and the subsequent incorporation of Al inside the lattice to form a mixed oxide with a periclase-type structure [14].The lattice parameter a calculated for OMgAl (0.419nm) is lower than for pure MgO (0.421nm), evidencing the dissolution of small amounts of Al3+ inside the MgO lattice to form solid solutions [15]. The XRD profiles of the uncalcined manganese oxides show the formation of hausmannite (Mn3O4) (JCPDSN° 24-0734) using a stoichiometric fuel/oxidant ratio (0.56), where the highest reaction temperatures are reached during self-combustion, which is in accordance with the enthalpy of formation necessary to form Mn3O4, 1387.4kJ/mol, compared with the enthalpy required to form Mn2O3 (958.1kJ/mol) and MnO2 (520.9kJ/mol) [16]. However, the manganese oxides present different behaviors in the calcination process. For OMn, the profile suggests the presence of Mn3O4 before calcination, while after the thermal treatment, this phase is oxidized to Mn2O3. In the case of uncalcined OMnMgAl, the profile shows the signals corresponding to the MgO periclase and Mn3O4 phases, although the presence of spinel phases Mn2MgO4, Mg2MnO4 and MnAl2O4 (JCPDSN° 23-0392, JCPDS N° 19-0773 and JCPDS N° 29-0880, respectively) cannot be ruled out. After calcination, the OMnMgAl profile shows signals at 18.6, 36.2 and 57.8°2θ assigned to Mn3O4 or other spinels and additionally the signals of MgO show a shift towards higher °2θ values, possibly to the segregation of Mn3O4 outside the oxidic matrix demonstrated by the lattice parameter a calculated for the maximum peak of MgO in the OMnMgAl oxide before and after calcination, with values corresponding to 0.426nm and 0.412nm, respectively. The decrease in the parameter a after the thermal process indicates the segregation of the Mn3O4 oxide (MnO∙n2O3) over the catalyst surface, since the Mn2+ ions present a larger ionic radius than Mg2+ ( r Mn 2 + : 0.083 n m and r Mg 2 + : 0.072 n m ) [9]. From the XRD profiles, the stabilizing effect of Mg and Al on the Mn3O4 phase inside the structure is demonstrated, since OMn undergoes a change in the phases present after calcination, going from Mn3O4 to Mn2O3 oxide while in the OMnMgAl solid, the MgO and Mn3O4 phases remain without evidence of the formation of other species before and after the thermal treatment. On the other hand, following the calcination process, the oxide MnOx revealed the signals corresponding to the Mn2O3, oxide exhibiting an XRD profile similar to the calcined OMn solid. Among the virtues of using hydrotalcites as mixed oxide precursors, the great dispersion and distribution presented by the active phases of the final oxides is noteworthy due to the inclusion of the cations inside the periclase phase, which controls the aggregation of particles [17]. Table 1 shows an improvement in the dispersion and distribution of manganese as the active phase, when incorporating Mg and Al, it is observed when comparing the particle sizes calculated with the Scherrer equation, where the particle size is 7nm for OMnMgAl, while the particle size is approximately 30nm in the OMn oxide. Considering the particle sizes found for the OMn and MnOx oxides (Table 1), it can be established that by means of the two methods (self-combustion and direct calcination) oxides are achieved with the same phases and a similar particle dispersion. On the other hand, in oxides obtained by self-combustion, the resulting area is attributed to the evolution of gases such as CO2 and H2O generated during the combustion process, which produce a “template effect” and lead to materials with high porosity [18]. Fig. 2 shows type II isotherms (IUPAC classification) for the oxides, corresponding mainly to macroporous materials with H3-type hysteresis, characteristic of agglomerates of slit-shaped pores with non-uniform sizes and shapes [19,20]. The textural properties for OMgAl, OMnMgAl, OMn and MnOx are reported in Table 1. The results reflect that the surface area and pore volume improve with the presence of Mg and Al due to the decrease in crystallite size. In contrast, the introduction of Mn into the OMgAl structure decreases the surface area and pore volume of the final material. On the other hand, solids OMn and MnOx present similar surface areas without any significant effect being shown on the texture of the material when using self-combustion as a synthesis method. 3.2 Oxygen storage capacity and mobility A useful technique to study the type of oxygen species present in the catalysts is the oxygen temperature programmed desorption, where the oxygen species can be represented by the process O2(ad) →O2 − (ad) →O− (ad) →O2− (lattice) [21]. The O2-TPD profiles of the OMnMgAl and OMn mixed oxides are presented in Fig. 3 . In the desorption curve of OMnMgAl, three signals centered at 230°C, 620°C and 770°C stand out, suggesting the formation of oxygen species of different nature and mobility. The low temperature signal is assigned to oxygen species called α, which are weakly bound to the surface or adsorbed on the catalyst vacancies (O2 − and O−) and can participate in the oxidation process by a suprafacial mechanism. The remaining signals are attributed to so-called β oxygen species that come from the oxygens of the lattice (O2−), whose desorption temperature depends on the ease of reduction, the mobility of the oxide oxygens and the strength of the Mn-O bond, which in turn depends on the Mn valence. These β species are involved in the oxidation reaction through an intrafacial mechanism [22,23]. Comparing the O2-TPD profile of the OMnMgAl oxide with the profile reported for Mn3O4 [2], it can be inferred that the predominant phase in this solid corresponds to hausmannite, due to the similarity between the curves and the temperatures reported for the desorption of the β oxygens (605°C and 800°C); however, the presence of MgO promotes the appearance of α oxygens in the OMnMgAl by the appearance of the signal at 230°C, which is absent from the profile of pure Mn3O4. On the other hand, the desorption profile of OMn and MnOx (not shown) is characterized by a strong signal at 870°C, attributed to the reduction of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 [24], suggesting the exclusive presence of lattice oxygens (O2−) in these solids. Catalytic oxidation is a dynamic process that requires the constant oxidation-reduction of the catalyst so that the conversion of the VOC is carried out satisfactorily, reason for which it becomes necessary to evaluate the reducibility of the materials and their capacity for re-oxidation. The (H2-TPR) and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) techniques provide information regarding the redox process and the oxygen species involved in the catalytic transformation. The profiles of (H2-TPR) are presented in Fig. 4 . The redox behavior of the materials is attributed exclusively to all the manganese oxides present in OMnMgAl, OMn and MnOx, given that OMgAl did not reveal reduction signals throughout the interval of temperatures studied (100–800°C). The reducibility can be evaluated considering the maximum reduction temperatures in the low temperature zone corresponding to the range where the catalytic process is carried out. When comparing the oxides, a better reducibility was observed in the solids prepared by self-combustion when presenting signals at 340°C, 375°C and 411°C for OMnMgAl, OMn and MnOx respectively. This displacement at low temperatures demonstrates the presence of species more likely to undergo redox processes in the oxides prepared by self-combustion, which is attributed to the great evolution of gaseous products and the rapid velocity of the process that give rise to defects that facilitate and improve the oxygen mobility in the structure of the materials. In addition, the best reducibility in OMnMgAl is related to the presence of Mg and Al which improves the dispersion of the active phases and therefore, there is a greater availability of species susceptible to oxide-reducing environments, results supported when comparing the quantities of hydrogen consumed to T<400° and which are shown in Table 1. The oxygen storage capacity determines the available amount of surface and lattice oxygen and provides additional information on the redox process. The concentration of the most reactive and labile oxygen species (OSC) is defined by the amount of oxygen that reacts during the first pulse of O2 after fully reducing the catalyst with H2 and the total amount of available oxygen (OSCC) is calculated based on the amount of oxygen consumed during the total re-oxidation of the catalyst (eight pulses) [25]. Fig. 5 shows the oxygen storage capacity of the OMnMgAl and OMn oxides as a function of the number of O2 pulses. From this figure, it is observed that the increase in the number of pulses leads to a lower OSC, due to a decrease in the concentration of surface oxygens or to the gradual decrease in the migration of the lattice oxygens towards the surface. The OSC values represent the amount of surface oxygen susceptible to undergo redox cycles and for OMnMgAl and OMn correspond to 10.6μmol O2/g and 6.1μmol O2/g, respectively. This results show that the oxide with Mg and Al contains more surface oxygens capable of participating in the VOC oxidation process. These results verify the O2-TPD findings, where the OMnMgAl oxide contains very active species oxygens (O2 − and O−), while the OSC determined for the OMn oxide comes exclusively from the lattice oxygens with great mobility to participate in oxidation reactions. Likewise, a higher OSC value demonstrates a greater re-oxidation capacity, as this measure is considered after carrying out a total reduction treatment with hydrogen. From the OSC data shown in Table 1, a higher re-oxidation ability and a greater number of species available for creating redox sites on the manganese oxide containing Mg and Al is established, which is an advantage in a process of catalytic oxidation. The OSCC, which determines the total amount of available oxygen (surface or from the lattice), was calculated by adding the OSC of all pulses, yielding a value of 31.4μmol O2/g for the OMnMgAl oxide and 12.1μmol O2/g for OMn. These results can be correlated with the textural properties and the particle size, as the larger area and the smaller particle size of the OMnMgAl oxide provide higher availability of the active sites and favor the reducibility of the solid by the presence of the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox pair of the Mn3O4 phase stabilized by the matrix Mg-Al-O. A way to study the mobility of the oxygens from the solids is using the 18O/16O oxygen isotope exchange technique, which can proceed through two mechanisms, homogeneous and heterogeneous [26]. 1. Homogeneous: without the participation of the oxygen atoms of the solid, where the 16O and 18O concentrations remain constant during the test. 16O2(g)+ 18O2(g)⇔218O16O(g) 2. Heterogeneous: simple when it involves one oxygen atom of the solid and one oxygen atom from the gas phase or multiple when two oxygen atoms of the solid and the molecular oxygen participate. 18O18O(g)+ 16O(s)⇔ 18O16O(g)+ 18O(s) (Simple) 18O18O(g)+ 16O 16O(s)⇔ 16O16O(g)+ 18O 18O(s) (Multiple) Fig. 6 shows the concentrations of the 16O2, 18O16O and 18O2 species exchanged with respect to the temperature over the studied manganese oxides. Although in this study, the results of the 18O/16O oxygen isotope exchange of the solid without Mn (OMgAl) are not shown, the concentrations of the 16O2, 18O16O and 18O2 species for this oxide are 85%, 3% and 14%, respectively, with no significant change observed with the temperature increase; thus, the exchange observed is mainly due to the manganese species present in the solid structure. Because homogeneous exchange occurs with the exclusive participation of gas phase oxygens, the changes in the contents of the different oxygen species shown for the manganese oxides confirm that the oxygen exchange occurs through a heterogeneous mechanism, with participation of the oxygens of the materials. The exchange process of gaseous oxygen with the oxygen from the solids involves the adsorption and dissociation of the 18O2 oxygen, the exchange of these adsorbed species with oxygen ions of the oxide and, finally, the desorption of oxygen in the form of molecules. In this way, the presence of 18O16O in both catalysts can be explained in terms of one of the mechanisms accepted for the simple heterogeneous exchange, where it is assumed that the adsorption of oxygen occurs on anionic vacancies and that one of the dissociated oxygens fills the defect, while the other migrates along the surface to recombine with an oxygen from the oxide and finally desorb [27]. This process can be represented as follows: 18O2(gas) +Vo→ 18O/Vo+ 18O(ad.) 18O(ad.) + 16O/Vo→ 18O16O(gas) +Vo (Vo represents the oxygen vacancies present in the oxide.) On the other hand, one of the possible mechanisms that explains the presence of 16O2 in the gas current is the existence of a multiple heterogeneous mechanism, where two lattice atoms leave the oxide and bind together to form molecular oxygen: 2O2− (s) →O2(g) +2Vo+4e−. The 18O2 molecules can adsorb on anionic vacancies and then diffuse into the bulk, which depends on the oxygen mobility of the catalyst. However, it cannot be excluded that the O2 content might also be generated by the interaction between a formed 18O16O species and some oxygens from the oxide [28]. The oxygen mobility of the materials is determinated by comparing the decrease in the concentration of the signal 36 (18O2), or the increase in the concentration of the signal 32 (16O2) in the analysis current. Fig. 6 reveals that the oxygens that contribute to the exchange process at 200°C on the oxides correspond to the surface oxygen species, while at temperatures above 200°C, the lattice oxygens play a fundamental role. If the oxygens migrate easily from the bulk towards the surface or vice versa, the exchange with gaseous oxygen will be higher, and therefore, the solid will have higher O2 mobility. It is observed that at 200°C, the concentrations of 16O2 in OMnMgAl and OMn correspond to 78% and 76%, while at 260°C, the concentrations are 11% and 19%, respectively. The decrease in the 16O2 concentrations over both oxides indicates that initially, all the most-available and labile surface oxygen species are exchanged (O2 − , O− O2−), and after the lattice oxygen must migrate to the surface for the process to occur, then, the OMnMgAl oxide have the smallest oxygen mobility because is the solid with the smallest amount of 16O2 at the second temperature used (260°C). For the OMn oxide, the mobility of the lattice oxygens increases with temperature, considering the increase in the concentration of 16O2 in the gas current from 260°C to 400°C, which reaches 51% for this latter temperature. In the OMnMgAl oxide, the 16O2 content only increases again at 400°C (20%), showing that, in this catalyst, the participation of the lattice oxygens is only favored at elevated temperatures. These results demonstrate a higher contribution of the lattice oxygens of the OMn oxide to the 18O/16O oxygen isotope exchange and therefore a higher oxygen mobility than in the OMnMgAl oxide, which can be explained in terms of the strong interactions that manganese may exhibit in the solid solution, since some Mn ions can replace the Mg2+ and Al3+ ions inside the periclase lattice and decrease the oxygen mobility. Moreover, the presence of MnAl2O4 type spinel phases in OMnMgAl decreases the O2 mobility due to the high stability of these phases and the difficulty of reducing Al3+ [29,30]. 3.3 Catalytic activity Volatile organic compounds are emitted daily into the atmosphere from human activities or natural sources, and prolonged exposure can lead to negative effects on the nervous system, eye and throat irritation and even carcinogenic effects [11]. The catalytic behavior of the oxides was evaluated for the oxidation of three representative VOCs of different natures, toluene, ethyl acetate and 2-propanol. The activity of the materials in the catalytic oxidation of the three VOCs was compared considering two characteristic temperatures, T50 and T90, which correspond to the temperatures necessary to achieve 50% and 90% conversion of the organic compound to CO2; thus, the catalyst with the lowest value of T50 and T90 exhibits the best activity. Figs. 7–9 show the results of the oxidation of toluene, ethyl acetate and 2-propanol on the manganese oxides. The catalyst composed of only Mg and Al, OMgAl, does not present significant activity in the temperature of conversion range of the other catalysts; thus, the catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the presence of manganese. Fig. 7 shows the conversion of the three VOCs based on the temperature. The results in general show that the oxides obtained by self-combustion exhibit the best catalytic performance due to having the lowest processing temperatures among the organic compounds. This behavior coincides with the best redox properties and the greater oxygen mobility found in the H2-TPR and OSC analyses, thus verifying the efficacy of self-combustion as a method of oxide synthesis compared to a simple calcination process. Considering only the OMnMgAl and OMn oxides, it is shown that the presence of Mg and Al considerably reduces the conversion temperatures of oxygenated VOCs due to the participation of surface oxygen species and a highly mobile network, whereas in the case of toluene, OMn shows lesser conversion temperatures. The catalytic performance in the oxidation of the three VOCs on the materials was analyzed mainly in terms of T50 y T90 conversion values ​​towards CO2, since this compound is the final product of the total combustion of organic substrates. Fig. 8a shows the catalytic oxidation of toluene towards CO2 as the only product of the catalytic oxidation on the oxides. The values of T90(±5°C)/T50(±2°C) for OMnMgAl and OMn correspond to 273°C/248°C and 258°C/236°C, respectively, showing lower temperatures of conversion of the aromatic on the oxide that does not contain Mg and Al, OMn. These results seem to be correlated with the oxygen mobility of the oxides, where the catalyst that presents higher exchange capacity, and therefore better O2 mobility, will have higher catalytic activity for the oxidation of toluene. In the oxidation of the ester, CO2, water and acetaldehyde were the only reaction products, Figs. 8b and 9 a. From Fig. 8b, it is clear that the OMnMgAl oxide presents the best catalytic performance, exhibiting the lowest values of T90 (±3°C) and T50 (±2°C), 220°C and 206°C, compared to the temperatures of conversion of OMn oxide, 230°C and 218°C, respectively. This behavior is explained in terms of the results of the OSC, where the material that presents the best redox properties has the best activity for the oxidation of ethyl acetate. This result is attributed to the presence of manganese ions in different oxidation states (Mn2+/Mn3+) in the OMnMgAl oxide, favoring the VOC oxidation process more than the OMn oxide, where only the Mn3+ ion is present. The presence of acetaldehyde as an intermediate indicates that the ethyl acetate oxidation occurs through the formation of ethanol (Fig. 9a), which is the oxidation pathway proposed for the ester [31]. However, in the reaction products, there was no evidence of the presence of the alcohol, possibly because these compounds are oxidized faster than the acetaldehyde under the reaction conditions employed. Although it is known that the oxidation of the alcohol can be carried out through two parallel reactions, dehydrogenation forming acetone and dehydration to propene [32], the results found showed the formation of CO2, H2O and acetone as the only reaction products with the catalysts, Figs. 8c and 9b. From the figures it can be inferred that not all of the 2-propanol is oxidized to acetone, but part of the alcohol is oxidized directly to CO2. Also, it is noted that at temperatures below 170°C the conversion of 2-propanol is due only to the formation of acetone since at these temperatures no formation of CO2 is given; on the other hand, at temperatures higher than 300°C the concentration of acetone drops to zero and the only reaction product is CO2. According to these results, the oxidation of 2-propanol is 100% selective towards CO2 at temperatures higher than 300°C. The values of T90 (±3°C) and T50 (±2°C) for the OMnMgAl oxide are 242°C and 216°C, while the values for OMn are 254°C and 234°C, respectively. These temperatures show better catalytic performance of the oxide containing Mg and Al. The larger surface area, the smaller particle size, the best redox properties and the existence of oxygen α are the qualities of the OMnMgAl oxide that lead to a higher catalytic activity for the conversion of the alcohol. In general, the temperatures of conversion suggest that for the OMnMgAl oxide, the existence of surface oxygen species such as electrophilic oxygens (O2 − , O−), promoted by the presence of Mg and Al, play a beneficial role in the oxidation of the oxygenated VOCs, while in the oxidation of toluene, the mobility of the nucleophilic oxygens O2− plays an essential role, with the OMn oxide exhibiting the best activity for the conversion of the aromatic. Finally, from the results of the oxidation of the three evaluated VOCs, it can be established, according to the average temperature values to achieve 90% of conversion to CO2, that ethyl acetate is the easiest VOC to oxidize (T90 ∼225°C), followed by 2-propanol (T90 ∼248°C) and finally toluene (T90 ∼265°C). It has been reported that the complete oxidation reactions occur through the activation of the weakest CH bond of the molecule [33–35]; thus, the oxidation reaction begins with the interaction of the VOC with oxygen from the surface, which can be from the oxide lattice or adsorbed molecules. If the strength of the CH bond is considered in terms of the enthalpy of dissociation of the bond, the differences in reactivity between toluene (ΔHC−H = 368 kJ/mol), 2-propanol (ΔHC−H = 380 kJ/mol) and ethyl acetate (ΔHC−H = 401kJ/mol) cannot be explained, as the energy requirement to activate toluene would be lower than for 2-propanol and ethyl acetate [36]. However, in the case of the alcohol and the ester, the lower temperatures of conversion are attributed to their high capacity of adsorption on the catalysts, forming species such as alkoxides that can be easily oxidized to total oxidation products [37]. 4 Conclusions Regardless of the synthesis method, oxides containing only manganese present the same phases, similar particle size and surface area, however, the manganese oxide obtained by self-combustion has a lower reduction temperature than that obtained for its prepared equivalent by direct calcination. Like the reduction temperatures, the OSC amount provide valuable information regarding the redox properties of the oxides and the mobility of the oxygen species, where OMn is the oxide that presents the best results in these properties, which is directly related to its better catalytic performance in the oxidation of the three VOCs compared to the MnOx oxide. The incorporation of Mg and Al into manganese oxides synthesized by the self-combustion method promotes the stabilization of the Mn3O4 phase, a highly active phase in oxidation reactions due to the presence of the Mn2+/Mn3+ pair. In addition, it increases the dispersion of the phases (smaller particle size in the OMnMgAl oxide (7nm) than OMn (30nm)), increases the specific area and contributes to generating highly active surface oxygen species. Considering these properties, it is clear that the synthesis of mixed manganese oxides by the self-combustion method, with a chemical composition similar to the results generated when using hydrotalcite-type precursors (Mn-Mg-Al-O), makes it possible to obtain materials that improve the exposure of the redox centers and adsorption sites of the VOC, with the presence of highly active oxygens (O2 − and O−), which makes these materials very efficient catalysts in the oxidation of various VOCs. On the other hand, in the OMn oxide, the high mobility of the lattice oxygens plays an important role in the oxidation of the VOCs, since this solid exhibits good catalytic performance, which is attributed to the lattice oxygens that are forced to migrate to the surface and thus allow the catalytic process to proceed, despite having a low surface area and storage capacity. The lower temperatures of conversion to CO2 in the oxidation of toluene confirm this assessment. It was determined that in the oxidation of the oxygenated VOCs, the participation of the surface oxygen species (O−, O2 −) is required, while in the conversion of toluene, the lattice oxygens are mainly responsible due to the high temperatures required. Thus, the OMnMgAl oxide is the most active catalyst in the total oxidation of ethyl acetate and 2-propanol, while the OMn is the most efficient in the oxidation of toluene. The differences in the catalytic performance of the OMnMgAl, OMn and MnOx oxides result from the oxygen species involved in the oxidative process, the redox properties, the surface area and the particle size.

        "dc:description": "Manganese mixed oxides with the compositions Mn-Mg-Al-O and Mn-O were synthesized by the self-combustion method. The effects of Mg and Al incorporation on the structural, textural, redox and catalytic properties of the manganese oxides were evaluated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, temperature-programed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), oxygen storage capacity (OSC), 18O/16O oxygen isotope exchange, and their catalytic performance was evaluated in the oxidation of toluene, ethyl acetate and 2-propanol. The analyses showed that the use of a glycine/nitrate ratio equal to 0.56 in the self-combustion favors the formation of the Mn3O4 phase and the incorporation of Mg and Al into the structure stabilizes this phase after a thermal process. In addition, the surface area increases, the particle size decreases, and the presence of electrophilic oxygens is favored, which increases the adsorption sites, exposes the active centers and facilitates the occurrence of redox cycles, leading to a better catalytic performance in the total conversion of the oxygenated compounds on the Mn-Mg-Al-O mixed oxide. In the oxide that only contains manganese, the presence of nucleophilic oxygens with great mobility was observed, leading to its good activity in the oxidation of the VOCs. The catalytic tests showed that a high oxygen exchange capacity leads to lower temperatures of conversion of toluene, which suggests that, for the oxidation of aromatic compounds, the lattice oxygen plays a fundamental role in the catalytic activity. In contrast, in the oxidation of oxygenated compounds that require lower temperatures of conversion, the existence of surface oxygens such as O2 − and O− favors the catalytic process and therefore ensures superior activity in the transformation of ethyl acetate and 2-propanol on the Mn-Mg-Al-O mixed oxide.",
