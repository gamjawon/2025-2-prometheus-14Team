10.1016/j.jechem.2021.11.009 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Fig. 1 Simplified conceptual framework of the experimental procedure performed in this study. The low C-rate data is collected at every 100 cycles during the rapid C-rate cycling. The data obtained at the low and high C-rates are converted to incremental capacity-differential voltage (IC-DV) using dQ/dV and dV/dQ equations, which are used to validate the rapid measurement. Fig. 2 (a) IC and (b) DV curve variation of the 1 Ah pouch full cell, which is degraded over 1600 cycles at a 6C. The voltage profiles of the IC-DV curves at 0.1C were acquired every 100 cycles. The stars (★) in (a) indicate the features of interest, which maintain their peak shape during cycling at a high C-rate cycles. Fig. 3 IC-DV curves of the full and half cells to determine the reaction mechanism processed by delithiation at graphite (the negative electrode vs. Li metal) and lithiation at NMC532 (the positive electrode vs. Li metal). Half-cell tests:data at the negative electrode is converted to (a) IC and (b) DV curves. Data obtained at the positive electrode is converted to (c) IC and (d) DV curves. Full-cell data for which the negative and positive electrodes are employed: (e) IC and (f) DV curves. Fig. 4 Capacity degradations at 6 (red) and 0.1C (black), which are intermittently acquired (every 100 cycles) over 1600 cycles; (a) 0.25 and (b) 1 Ah cells. Calculated loss of active materials (LAM) in the (c) 0.25 and (d) 1 Ah cells. Calculated loss of lithium inventory (LLI) in the (e) 0.25 and (f) 1 Ah cells. Each solid line is a second-order polynomial fitting curve. Fig. 5 Incremental capacity profiles of the (a) fresh and (b) aged 1 Ah pouch cell as a function of C-rate to detect the changes in cell voltage due to IR drop. (c and d) Shifts in the peak voltage and (e and f) decreases in peak intensity are represented in terms of C-rate. Note that Ch_I and Ch_II denote the peaks I and II during charging (a). Dch_I and Dch_II denote the peaks I and II during discharging. Fig. 6 Simplified incremental capacity peak intensity scheme at each cell capacity retention (%) as a function of C-rate.

Graphical abstract Rapid determination method of Li-ion battery degradation using high C-rate voltage profiles proposing insights into the states of degradation modes in aged cells. Herein, incremental capacity-differential voltage (IC-DV) at a high C-rate (HC) is used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool in lithium-ion batteries, which inevitably exhibit capacity fading caused by multiple mechanisms during charge/discharge cycling. Because battery degradation modes are complex, the simple output of capacity fading does not yield any useful data in that respect. Although IC and DV curves obtained under restricted conditions (<0.1C, 25 °C) were applied in non-invasive analysis for accurate observation of degradation symptoms, a facile, rapid diagnostic approach without intricate, complex calculations is critical in on-board applications. Herein, LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532)/graphite pouch cells were cycled at 4 and 6C and the degradation characteristics, i.e., loss of active materials (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI), were parameterized using the IC-DV curves. During the incremental current cycling, the initial steep LAM and LLI slopes underwent gradual transitions to gentle states and revealed the gap between low- and high-current measurements. A quantitative comparison of LAM at high and low C-rate showed that a ICHC revealed the relative amount of available reaction region limited by cell polarization. However, this did not provide a direct relationship for estimating the LAM at a low C-rate. Conversely, the limiting LLI, which is calculated at a C-rate approaching 0, was obtained by extrapolating the LLI through more than two points measured at high C-rate, and therefore, the LLI at 0.1C was accurately determined using rapid cycling. Keywords Battery degradation Rapid degradation diagnosis Loss of active materials (LAM) Loss of lithium inventory (LLI) Incremental capacity (IC) Differential voltage (DV) 1 Introduction With increasing use of lithium-ion batteries, diagnostic technologies to evaluate the states of health (SOHs) of these batteries are required to prevent abnormal battery operation [1–3]. During cell design, understanding the mechanism of battery degradation may prevent major degradation during operation and unexpected accidents or problems by rapidly identifying battery conditions that induce different types of deterioration in various climates and usage environments during operation [4–7]. Typically, the degradation modes of lithium-ion batteries are classified as conductivity loss (CL), loss of active materials (LAM), and loss of lithium inventory (LLI). LAM is associated with the disorder of the crystal structure within the positive electrode, blocking of active sites by the resistive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at the negative electrode, and particle breakage and loss of electrical contact in both electrodes. LLI is caused by side reactions, such as SEI layer growth during lithiation/delithiation, electrolyte decomposition, and lithium plating, which consume lithium ions in the electrolyte. CL is related to the corrosion of the current collector and decomposition of the binder during the reaction. Degradation modes are correlated, i.e., LLI may be strongly influenced by LAM upon electrochemical isolation of the lithiated active material [8–11]. Various non-invasive analytical methods for evaluating the SOHs of lithium-ion batteries have long been studied, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy [12–14], incremental capacity-differential voltage (IC-DV) [15,16], pseudo open circuit voltage (pOCV) measurements [17,18], and differential thermal voltammetry [19,20]. However, the causes and effects of complex deterioration mechanisms are not clearly identified [3,8]. Among the numerous SOH evaluation methods, IC-DV analysis is widely used due to good correlation between the deterioration mode and changes in IC-DV peaks [8]. Furthermore, because the IC-DV peaks may be directly derived using the charge/discharge curve with dQ/dV and dV/dQ conversion, the analysis does not require additional equipment. Many previous papers have reported attempts to analyze the degradation mode using IC-DV analysis. Dubarry et al. investigated the degradation modes by tracking the change of the peak area of the IC curves during the aging using graphite/LiFePO4(LFP) cell with simulation toolbox. They analyzed and compared the rate-dependent capacity fading and IC (dQ/dV) fluctuations during cell degradation, and confirmed that the integral IC peak area was used as key information to determine quantify the contribution of each mode [21,22]. Pastor-Fernández et al. and Ghassemi et al. identified the degradation modes in graphite/LiNiCoAlO2 and graphite/LFP cells, respectively, by investigating the changes of feature points of the IC and DV curves. They quantified the mode of degradation by observing feature points representing dominant IC and DV changes with LAM and LLI [11,23]. In addition, data-driven approach such as deep learning and machine learning becomes emerging research area nowadays because this approach allows non-linear matching and model-free intelligent algorithm. Severson et al and Chahbaz et al. reported that prediction of the cell aging in graphite/LFP and NMC-LiCoO2/Li4Ti5O12 cells, respectively, using machine learning technique based on IC-DV curve. They predicted the degradation mechanism through the IC curve obtained in the actual experiment and developed a machine learning model based on the IC curves [24,25]. However, the biggest drawback is that low current driving leads to large time consumption, requiring separate analysis time owing to measurement at an additional current other than the driving conditions. To obtain the voltage curve in the equilibrium state, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is measured at zero external current. Because OCV cannot be obtained during battery cycling, cycling studies are conducted under low current conditions (<0.1C) to acquire as similar equilibrium states as possible, denoted as pOCVs [15,16,26–28]. As fast-charging electric vehicles are actively studied, more rapid diagnostic techniques are required to improve their applicability to battery management systems. Several researchers have used IC-DV analysis at high C-rate to overcome these disadvantages. For example, Fly et al. reported that IC curve distortion could be removed via IR compensation. The IC analyses were performed at various C-rates (up to 1C), and resistances obtained using DC pulse resistance measurements were used to compensate for distorted voltages in graphite/LiFePO4 and graphite/LiNiCoAlO2 cells [27]. In addition, Chen et al. suggested that the IR drop of the IC curve at a maximum of 1C was corrected using the voltage derived via the electromotive force extraction method in graphite/NMC532 cells [29]. In this study, we analyzed the degradation modes of various capacity fading in graphite/LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532) pouch cells with two capacities (0.25 and 1 Ah) [30–32]. During cycling, the IC-DV curves obtained at low (0.1C, denoted as IC-DVLC) and high C-rates (4 and 6C, denoted as IC-DVHC) were used to determine LAMx and LLIx (where x is LC or HC, denoting the low or high C-rate, respectively), respectively. Changes in the IC-DV plot as a function of C-rate are analyzed, suggesting that the high C-rates may be usefully employed in the determination of battery degradation (LLILC at 0.1C) based on extrapolation of the hypothetical limiting LLI. 2 Experimental 2.1 Battery specifications NMC532/graphite pouch cells with nominal capacities of 0.25 and 1 Ah were purchased from Soulbrain (Seongnam, Republic of Korea). The loading amounts of active material in the 0.25 and 1 Ah cells were the same, with 5.5 mg cm−2 of active material on each positive electrode. The cells contained electrolytes consisting of LiPF6 (1 M) in EC:EMC:DEC (3:5:2 vol%) containing VC (1 wt%) and 1,3-propane sultone (2 wt%), with an N/P ratio of 1.1. The capacity can be solely determined by the stack number (5 for 0.25 Ah and 20 for 1 Ah, respectively). 2.2 Battery cycling All battery studies were conducted using a battery cycler system (WBCS 3000S, WonATech, Seoul, Republic of Korea and BCS-815, Biologic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France) in a temperature chamber maintained at 45 °C for rapid degradation [33]. The electrochemical properties of all pouch cells were measured by applying a uniform external pressure. For rapid cell deterioration, the long-term cycle test was performed in high C-rate constant current (CC) charge/discharge mode (4 and 6C) between 3.0 and 4.25 V. During cycling, the charge/discharge data in the pOCV state were obtained using low C-rate (0.1C) charge/discharge at regular intervals. All C-rates were calculated based on the nominal capacity specified by the manufacturer. The IC curves were derived using the voltage and capacity histories during the cycling tests. The DV curve was obtained using the inverse of the IC profile. 2.3 Half-cell tests Electrodes were retrieved from each fresh and degraded 1 Ah pouch cell after discharge with a state of charge (SOC) of 0. Because of internal cell thermal inhomogeneity, which was induced by the imbalanced current flow [34–36], uneven local degradation was considered. Thus, all electrodes were collected from centrally located stacks and then punched into five individual 14 mm-diameter disks. Before punching, the opposite sides of the coated electrodes were gently removed using 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. The electrodes were rinsed in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solution to remove any remaining surface electrolytes. Coin-type cells (CR2032) were assembled with the same electrolyte as that within the pouch cells. Each anode and cathode half-cell was cycled in the voltage range 0.01–1 V and 3.0–4.3 V, respectively, under CC charge and discharge (0.1C). 2.4 Electrochemical measurements Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements were performed using the battery cycler system by applying a CC (0.1C) for 12 min, followed by open circuit equilibration for 20 min. For a practical, simple test, a short relaxation time was applied. 2.5 Instrumental analysis Fresh and degraded electrodes were collected after disassembling the pouch cells and washed with DMC solution in an Ar-filled glove box. The degraded state of each graphite active material was analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4300, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The dried electrodes were stored in a sealed plastic container under an Ar atmosphere prior to analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Conceptual protocol for diagnosis Fig. 1 shows the overall process for collecting battery degradation data during charging/discharging, with validation of the IC-DVHC relative to the IC-DVLC. To proceed with rapid battery degradation and analysis, a main cycle test is conducted at high C-rate charge/discharge conditions (4 and 6C). Low C-rate charge/discharge data are collected at regular intervals by lowering the C-rate to 0.1C, which is low enough to minimize the polarization effect. The charge/discharge voltage at 0.1C is a pOCV, which is close to the equilibrium state, allowing more accurate observations of the degradation phenomena [11,37]. The obtained high and low C-rate charge/discharge data are converted to IC and DV curves using the dQ/dV and dV/dQ equations, respectively. The LAM is calculated using Eq. (1) with respect to the change in peak intensity in the IC curve, where Δ Q is the charge difference (Ah) and Δ V is the voltage difference (V). Meanwhile, the LLI is derived using Eq. (2) with respect to the end-of-curve shift in the DV curve, where Q is charge (Ah). Eqs. (1) and (2) are widely used in the simulation of battery degradation since Dubarry et al. [8,11,23,38,39]. The subscript lowercase i in the equation indicates the corresponding cycle number. CL is ignored because it exerts a trivial influence on the IC-DV curve compared to those of LAM and LLI [26]. (1) L A M i = m a x ( Δ Q Δ V ) 1 - m a x ( Δ Q Δ V ) i m a x ( Δ Q Δ V ) 1 ∙ 100 (2) L L I i = m a x ( Q ) 1 - m a x ( Q ) i m a x ( Q ) 1 ∙ 100 The peaks in the IC plots represent the phase transitions of the active material during the reactions, whereas the peaks of the DV plots reveal the single-phase states as functions of cell capacities. Each reaction is simply identified in the DV plot, because it reveals the peaks and troughs of each anodic and cathodic half-cell [26]. Fig. 2 shows the curve variation of each IC and DV at a 6C within a 1 Ah pouch cell. In the IC plot in Fig. 2(a), several dominant changes are observed. We assign the changes in the peak intensities indicated by stars in Fig. 2(a) to features of interest (FOIs), as they are distinguishable at ICLC and ICHC. The FOI between 3.4 and 3.5 V exhibits relatively minor variations during cell degradation, whereas the highest FOI near 3.6 V dramatically decreases. The observed peak intensity changes in the IC curves are the results of the conversion from data obtained from each voltage curves at 0.1C. Because the two FOIs in the IC plot reflect the active material phase deterioration, the sum of the changes is used in the calculation of the LAM (Eq. (1)). Conversely, Fig. 2(b) shows the DV plot, clearly demonstrating a horizontal shift as the cell degrades (as indicated by the arrow). The LLI is calculated using the capacity derived using the DV plot in the fatigued state relative to that of the initial state (Eq. (2)). 3.2 Understanding the reaction mechanism using half-cell tests Because the converted IC-DV curve shown in Fig. 2 shows complicated peaks and troughs, we investigated the origin of each peak using positive and negative half-cell tests. Fig. 3 . shows the IC curves of the coin-type half cells (Fig. 3a and c), which are assembled using retrieved degraded electrodes from a 1 Ah pouch full cell, and the coin-type full cell (Fig. 3e). The peaks in the IC curves of the half-cell are strongly related to the phase transitions of graphite (negative electrode) and NMC532 (positive electrode) during delithiation and lithiation, respectively. The A1, A2, and A3 peaks observed using the negative electrode (Fig. 3a) and C1 and C2 peaks observed using the positive electrode (Fig. 3c) are explained as follows: Step-by-step lithiated Li ions within the graphite lattices are consecutively deintercalated. The peaks during graphite phase transition are identified at 0.12, 0.15, and 0.23 V, which correspond to stages 1–2 (A1), 2–3L (A2), and 4L–1L (A3), respectively [28,40,41]. Conversely, during discharge, NMC532 consisting of the layered transition metal oxide undergoes a phase transition from monoclinic to hexagonal in the potential range 3.8–4.0 V (C1). A broad peak in the potential range 3.5–3.8 V corresponds to the phase transition from rhombohedral to monoclinic (C2) [28,40]. These simultaneous lithiation and delithiation reactions at each negative and positive electrode are merged into three combined peaks (I, II, and III) in the full-cell discharge IC curve (Fig. 3e) [28,40]. In the DV curves, the troughs shown in Fig. 3(b, d, and f) corres Figs. 5 and 6 pond to the IC peaks shown in Fig. 3(a, c, and e). Because the X-axis is the voltage and capacity in the IC and DV curves, respectively, the troughs and peaks are not observed in the same positions. Unlike the IC curve, the DV curve directly provides data regarding the capacity fading, with which we may evaluate the contribution to degradation of either the negative or positive electrode. In addition, the full-cell DV curve is composed of the summation of the DV curves of the negative and positive electrodes [15,42]. Therefore, half-cell tests are used to determine which electrode mainly contributes to capacity fading during cycling (Fig. S1). To accurately compare the fresh and aged cells, reference points are set at the first reaction step: 0.62 and 0.41 mAh for the negative and positive electrodes (Fig. S1a and b), respectively, which are denoted by arrows (↓). Fig. S1c clearly shows that the decrease in the capacity is mainly due to the negative electrode. This is consistent with previous studies that reported that the degraded delithiated graphite contributes considerably to cell degradation, generating Li plating [8,43,44]. 3.3 Quantification of LAM and LLI To compare LAM and LLI at different C-rates, IC-DVHC and IC-DVLC were calculated using the charge/discharge profiles at 4 (Fig. S2) and 6C (Fig. 4 ) in 0.25 and 1 Ah graphite/NMC532 pouch cells. The 1 Ah pouch cell contains four-fold more stacks than those within the 0.25 Ah pouch cell, with each stack bearing the same amount of active material. Fig. 4 shows the cycle profiles at high and low C-rates (6 and 0.1C) over 1600 cycles, which are intermittently recorded every 100 cycles, with the capacity fading at 0.1C decreasing to approximately 20%. The obtained cycle profile was used for the calculations of the LAM and LLI via IC-DV analysis. As shown in Fig. 4(c–f), more than three points are acquired every 100 cycles to calculate LAM and LLI based on IC-DVHC to avoid biased collection due to data fluctuation (e.g., the block box in Fig. 4c). Fig. 4(c and d) shows that LAMLC is slightly higher than LAMHC, which is consistent with the results obtained at 4C over 800 cycles (Fig. S2c and d). Fig. 4(c and d) suggests that LAMHC derived from the ICHC is appropriate to estimate the LAM because there is a similar gap between LAMHC and LAMLC, although the slow C-rate (0.1C) is generally employed to estimate the degree of LAM. A detailed analysis of this is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The 1 Ah cell shows a significant gap between the LLIs at the 0.1 and 6C (Fig. 4f), which is because the 1 Ah cell contains a four-fold higher number of stacks than that within the 0.25Ah cell. Thus, the 1 Ah cell is possibly affected by non-uniform current flow, which influences the utilization of local active material even at identical areal current densities. Under 6C cycling, only a fraction of the active materials is intensively deteriorated because the reaction is concentrated at a specific location. Conversely, the site where the reaction is inactive may participate in lithiation or delithiation when the C-rate is 0.1C. Therefore, the increased capacity at the low C-rate in the 1 Ah cell is attributed to the relieved kinetic limitation. 3.4 LAM analysis interpretation For a detailed analysis of the data obtained at high and low C-rates shown in Fig. 4, we required insight into the effects of the C-rate on the LAM and LLI. Thus, the IC curves of fresh and aged cells (1 Ah) were measured during charge/discharge as a function of C-rate (Fig. 5a and b). Fig. 5c and d show the peak voltage shifts, which are denoted by I and II in Fig. 5(a and b). In the case of peak II, the multiple peaks observed at 0.1C converge into one peak as the C-rate increases. As shown in Fig. 5(c and d), the cathodic (red) and anodic peaks (blue) shift to lower and higher voltages, respectively, owing to the increasing IR drop as the C-rate increases. In addition, because the peak shifts exhibit a linear relationship with the C-rate, the shift may therefore be corrected via IR compensation (Fig. 5c). For the aged cell (Fig. 5d), a similar tendency to that of the fresh cells (Fig. 5c) is observed. However, the slope of the voltage shift as a function of the C-rate is slightly more gradual. This is attributed to the facilitation of delithiation progression in the aged cell due to the microcracks formed in the graphite electrode, which favors solid-state diffusion [45]. These results are consistent with the GITT analysis profile shown in Fig. S3. The GITT test was performed to compare the overpotentials during delithiation in fresh graphite cells with those of aged cells. For aged cells, the spike gap between voltages at charge and cut-off currents decreases over the entire SOC range, strongly indicating that the diffusion kinetics are improved in the aged cell. Although the peak voltage shifts linearly as a function of C-rate (Fig. 5c and d), it is not used in Eqs. (1) and (2) to determine the LAM characteristics, as peak intensity changes are the variables required. However, the changes in the peak intensities as functions of C-rate reveal that the intensity of peak I (indicated by the open circles) decreases nonlinearly for the fresh and aged cells (Fig. 5e and f). In addition, the intensity of peak II (indicated by the closed circles) of the fresh cell decreases nonlinearly, similar to peak I, as a function of C-rate (Fig. 5e). This nonlinearity is not yet sufficient to yield useful data regarding the battery degradation. However, when the intensities of peaks I and II are summed (Fig. S4), this may be converted into useful values for LAMLC and LAMHC, yielding good insight. To simplify this summation (Fig. S4), we replot the IC peak intensity sum, which is strongly related to the total available capacity, as a function of the C-rate, from 0.1 to 6C (Fig. 6). This clearly reveals that the curvature gradually decreases during cell degradation; 100%, 90%, and 85% retention exhibit different y-axis values and curvatures with respect to C-rate. The steep curvature indicates that the battery is significantly affected by the C-rate. The dotted lines are hypothetical curves that may be observed when the diffusion properties of the active materials do not change from those at 100% cell capacity retention as the degradation proceeds. The 85% retention curve exhibits relatively low peak intensity summations, and therefore the total available capacity is low because of the aging of the battery. In addition, the curvature of the 85% plot is gradual, indicating that the C-rate effect on the capacity is relatively low due to enhanced diffusion properties, as observed using the GITT. Fig. 6 is consistent with the smaller calculated LAMHC than LAMLC shown in Fig. S2 and 4; for Fig. 6, the LAMLC at the 0.1C-rate is higher than the LAMHC at the 6C. Therefore, the LAMLC is always slightly higher than the LAMHC for a similar graph shape, which allows an approximate estimation of the degradation pattern (Fig. 4c and d, and Fig. S2c and d). However, there are no correlations that can derive exactly the value at a low C-rate using high C-rate data because of the nonlinearity of the LAM in terms of C-rate. 3.5 LLI analysis interpretation Because LLI is the most prominent degradation mode at the negative electrode [18,46], DV analysis of fresh and aged cells was performed at various C-rates to compare LLILC and LLIHC (Fig. 7 a and b). Fig. 7c shows a decrease in capacity with increasing C-rate, showing that LLI at a C-rate approaching 0 (referred to as the limiting LLI) may be estimated using the values at higher C-rates. Because an inverse linear relationship is observed between C-rate and capacity, LLILC (at 0.1C, or the limiting LLI) may be estimated by extrapolating LLIHC through more than two data points (Fig. 7c). The major symptom of LLI is the growth of the SEI layer due to lithium-ion consumption caused by electrolyte decomposition. As the cell ages, the gradual growth of the SEI layer composed of inorganic and organic compounds on the graphite basal plane is observed due to electrolyte decomposition (Fig. S5a, c, and e) [47,48]. Once a microcrack occurs at the basal plane, the propagation of the crack cleaves the graphite particles. The extended surface area then triggers additional electrolyte reduction, and further loss of lithium ions may be induced by the newly formed SEI layer [47,49,50]. The degradation of the negative electrode was visualized using SEM (Fig. S5b, d, and f). The SEM images of the negative electrodes of the 1 and 0.25 Ah cells are captured at capacity retention of approximately 70% at 6C. However, the capacity profile measured at the intermittent 0.1C-rate shows different capacity retention, e.g., 83% and 68% in the 1 and 0.25 Ah cells, respectively. The SEM images clearly show that the degree of electrode degradation in the 1 Ah cell is quite different from that in the 0.25 Ah cell, indicating that the capacity fading profile at the rapid C-rate (6C) does not directly reflect the state of the electrode within the battery. Instead, the low C-rate (0.1C, or the limiting LLI) is useful for estimating the electrode degradation. Therefore, LLILC estimated by extrapolating LLIHC may indicate the degree of SEI layer growth in aged cells. For highly stacked cells with inhomogeneous degradation, a simple quantification of the LLI may be conducted using this method. For future studies, we discuss extensibility of our results. High C-rate analysis is time-efficient. However, because applying high current and accuracy of analysis have a trade-off relationship, it is necessary to check whether the degradation signal can be traced in peak change of IC curve according to the increase of C-rate. In addition, to apply to other cells, the C-rate should be selected in consideration of the rate capability of the cells, because it is affected by the mass loading, type of active material, and operation conditions such as applied pressure and temperature. 4 Conclusion We proposed a non-destructive method as an alternative to the time-consuming IC-DV analysis to investigate lithium-ion battery degradation modes. We demonstrated that intuitive indicators, i.e., LAMHC and LLIHC, yielded insights into the states of LAM and LLI in aged cells, providing effective parameters for evaluating battery SOH during operation under fast-charging circumstances. For LAM, although we could not exactly derive LAMLC from LAMHC owing to the nonlinear relationship with the C-rate, insights were obtained using the sum of the IC peak intensities, which was clearly related to the total available capacity. The capacity of the aged cell was less affected by the changing C-rate, which was attributed to the enhanced diffusion properties of degraded battery cells. This was consistent with the GITT results. Conversely, for LLI, which represented SEI layer growth on the negative electrode, the capacity as a function of the C-rate exhibited good linearity. This therefore enabled the use of LLIHC in extrapolation to estimate the limiting LLI, which was the calculated LLI at the OCV (C-rate approaching 0), allowing rapid evaluation of LLI battery degradation. This study provides a facile process to analyze intricate degradation modes at high-current cycling within a limited time, which may be useful in the evaluation of on-board battery systems.

        "dc:description": "Herein, incremental capacity-differential voltage (IC-DV) at a high C-rate (HC) is used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool in lithium-ion batteries, which inevitably exhibit capacity fading caused by multiple mechanisms during charge/discharge cycling. Because battery degradation modes are complex, the simple output of capacity fading does not yield any useful data in that respect. Although IC and DV curves obtained under restricted conditions (<0.1C, 25 °C) were applied in non-invasive analysis for accurate observation of degradation symptoms, a facile, rapid diagnostic approach without intricate, complex calculations is critical in on-board applications. Herein, LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532)/graphite pouch cells were cycled at 4 and 6C and the degradation characteristics, i.e., loss of active materials (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI), were parameterized using the IC-DV curves. During the incremental current cycling, the initial steep LAM and LLI slopes underwent gradual transitions to gentle states and revealed the gap between low- and high-current measurements. A quantitative comparison of LAM at high and low C-rate showed that a ICHC revealed the relative amount of available reaction region limited by cell polarization. However, this did not provide a direct relationship for estimating the LAM at a low C-rate. Conversely, the limiting LLI, which is calculated at a C-rate approaching 0, was obtained by extrapolating the LLI through more than two points measured at high C-rate, and therefore, the LLI at 0.1C was accurately determined using rapid cycling.",
