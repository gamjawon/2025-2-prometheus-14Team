(C.P. 29), 98166 Sant'Agata di Messina, Italy Received 8 January 1996; accepted 31 May 1996 Abstract The influence of ammonia on the reactivity of a V-Sb-oxide catalyst in propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN) was studied by infrared spectroscopy and flow reactor tests. Ammonia coordinates as such or as ammonium ions on the catalyst surface in relative amounts which depend on both the temperature at the time of contact and the hydroxylation state of the catalyst. The two chemisorbed species influence both the surface reactivity and the pathways of the reaction in propane ammoxidation. NH3 chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites inhibits the activation of propane differently from that chemisorbed on Br~nsted sites. The formation of the latter species, however, inhibits the reactivity of the Br~nsted sites in catalyzing various side reactions which decrease the selectivity to ACN. The results of the infrared study are in good agreement with the change in surface reactivity observed in flow reactor tests as a function of the concentration of ammonia in the feed. Both the nature and the amount of the chemisorbed ammonia species thus determine the intrinsic surface reactivity and selectivity of V-Sb-oxide catalysts in the synthesis of acrylonitrile.

Centi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 commercialization [6] due to the considerable difference in the price between an alkene or alkane feedstock and the significant contribution of the feedstock to the production cost. V-Sb-oxide based catalysts have good catalytic properties in propane am- moxidation [7-15] and have also been extensively patented for this reaction [16,17]. Various aspects of their catalytic behavior in propane ammoxidation have been reported in the literature, including (i) their structural chemistry and structure-activity relationships [11,18-27], (ii) their chemistry of preparation [12], (iii) their surface characteristics and analysis of the changes in reactivity or surface properties upon contact with the reactants [7-9,15] and (iv) the reaction kinetics [13,14]. V-Sb-oxide catalysts are characterized by the presence of a non-stoichiomet- ric rutile VSbO4-1ike phase (the exact composition depends on the method of preparation, type of thermal treatment, etc. [11,18-27]) plus tx-Sb204 when the Sb/V atomic ratio is > 1.0. Calcination temperatures above 1070 K lead to the ot-Sb204 ----) ~-Sb204 transformation [12]. When the Sb/V ratio is greater than 1.0, an increase in the selectivity to ACN is noted with a parallel decrease in the side reaction of NH3 conversion to N2 [2,8,14,27]. Control of the rate of unselective oxidation of ammonia to N2 has been reported as a key factor in determining the selectivity to ACN, because this side reaction limits the availability of the surface ammonia species necessary for ACN synthesis. A characteristic aspect of the reactivity of V-Sb-oxide catalysts in propane ammoxidation, in fact, is the apparent lower rate of transformation of the intermediate propene to ACN in comparison with the rate of propane to propene oxidative dehydrogenation [2,13,14]. Antimonate catalysts with a non- stoichiometric rutile-like structure and the presence of ot-Sb204 show excellent properties in the ammoxidation of propene [28,29]. V-Sb-oxide catalysts are also more selective and active in propene ammoxidation than in propane ammoxidation [7,15]. It is therefore apparently contradictory that the difficult step in propane ammoxidation to ACN is the conversion of the intermediate propene, if this hydrocarbon is converted at a much higher rate and with a higher selectivity to ACN on the same kind of catalysts, although in separate catalytic tests. The more severe reaction conditions (higher reaction temperature, longer contact times) required to convert propane in comparison with propene [1-4] cause a reasonable increase in the rates of ammonia oxidation to N2 with respect to that of ammonia used for the ACN synthesis [14]. Consequently, a lowering of the amount of chemisorbed ammonia species necessary for ammoxi- dation of the propene intermediate is expected. However, even in tests at low conversion and in the presence of an excess of ammonia, the selectivity to ACN from propane is considerably lower than that observed from propene on the same catalysts. This suggests that the differences in the surface reactivity of V-Sb-oxide catalysts in the ammoxidation of propane and propene may not be due only to the effect of the temperature on the rate of the NH3 --9 N2 reaction, G. Centi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 227 but also to a modification of the intrinsic surface reactivity characteristics due to a different nature and amount of chemisorbed species in the two cases. In the oxidation of n-butane over vanadium-phosphorus oxide (VPO) cata- lysts [30,31] it has been observed that the surface reactivity of the same catalyst in n-butane, 1-butene and butadiene oxidation may not be directly comparable due to the different population of strongly chemisorbed hydrocarbon species deriving from the different coordination chemistry of the olefins with the surface sites of the catalyst with respect to the paraffin. Furthermore, this strong chemisorption of the olefins inhibits that of oxygen. Both effects were the cause of a higher reactivity and selectivity of VPO in n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride than in 1-butene or butadiene oxidation to the same product, although both these olefins were indicated as the reaction intermediates from n-butane to maleic anhydride [30,31]. It is possible that an analogous effect also exists in the case of V-Sb-oxide catalysts, but due to the different surface acidity properties between the two classes of catalysts, the explanation may not fully justify the differences observed in the reactivity behavior of V-Sb-oxides in propane and propene ammoxidation. The reaction of propane ammoxidation over vanadium-phosphorus oxide catalysts ((VO)2P207 phase, in particular) has also been studied [32,33]. The more interesting observation over this catalyst was that the selectivity to ACN and the surface reactivity in propane depletion depend on the surface coverage of ammonia species chemisorbed at Lewis and Br~nsted acid sites. The chemisorbed ammonia was also found to inhibit the chemisorption of oxygen species necessary for the propane to propene conversion and therefore the optimal selectivity to ACN was found for an intermediate surface coverage with chemisorbed ammonia species. In infrared experiments [33] it also was observed that ammonia may influence the pathway of transformation of surface intermedi- ates. An influence of ammonia on the competitive pathways of surface transforma- tion has also been observed in toluene ammoxidation over vanadia-on-titania catalysts [34,35]. After a first step of H-abstraction to form a benzylic-like adsorbed radical, there are two main possible pathways: (i) the intermediate may react with an activated ammonia species to form a benzylamine intermediate further dehydrogenated to benzonitrile or (ii) the addition of lattice oxygen to the intermediate may occur with the formation of a benzyloxo or benzoate species which then reacts with the chemisorbed ammonia species to form the aromatic nitrile. Although apparently both pathways lead to the same final product, it is reasonable that the reactivity of the intermediates towards the direct or side reactions may be different and thus the intrinsic selectivity of the two pathways of transformation may be different. The two competitive pathways of reaction are a function of (i) the redox and coordination properties of the catalyst and (ii) the reaction temperature, but also depend on the amount of chemisorbed ammonia species. For this reason, the selectivity to the aromatic 228 G. Centi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 nitrile and its rate of formation show, for example, a maximum as a function of the concentration of ammonia in the feed [36,37]. Various examples thus exist which show that the chemisorption of ammonia over the catalyst and the nature/amount of chemisorbed ammonia species influence the reactivity properties of vanadium-based catalysts for the ammoxi- dation of hydrocarbons. The objective of the present study was to analyze the role of ammonia chemisorption in the modification of the reactivity and of the competitive pathways of reaction in the case of propane ammoxidation over a V-Sb-oxide catalyst. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used as the investigation tool to study the nature of the adsorbed species formed upon contact with the reagents or possible intermediates and obtain information about their influence on the surface reactivity. The results of the IR study were then used to analyze the reactivity in flow reactor conditions. Other aspects of the catalytic behavior of the V-Sb-oxide sample used in this study, its chemistry of preparation and its physico-chemical characteristics have been reported previously [12,27] as well as other aspects of the surface chemistry of these catalysts and the reaction mechanism in propane ammoxidation [38]. 2. Experimental A V-Sb-oxide catalyst with an Sb:V ratio of 1.0 (hereafter referred to simply as VSbO) was prepared by a precipitation-deposition method which allows highly selective catalysts to be obtained [27]. An aqueous 0.1 M HCl solution of VC13 is added dropwise to an aqueous 3-5 M HC1 solution of SbC15 to form first an Sb-hydroxide precipitate and then the V-Sb-mixed hydroxide by changing the pH to a basic value via the addition of a solution of concentred ammonia. The precipitate after 2 hours of ageing is then filtered, washed three times with distilled water and dried at 410 K overnight. The resulting solid is first calcined in a flow of air up to 870 K (3 h) using a constant rate of increase in temperature (50 K. h-1) and then activated at 770 K (3h) in a flow of propane, ammonia and air (the time of activation corresponds to the time necessary to reach the steady-state activity in propane conversion). During the activation procedure, a partial reduction of surface Vs + occurs together with an increase in the selectivity to acrylonitfile [8,9,12]. The surface area of the sample after the calcination and activation step is 17 m2 g- ~. The surface area does not change during the activation step in comparison with the surface area of the sample after calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the sample after activation show the presence of only a ruffle-like vanadium-antimonate phase and the unit cell characteristics correspond to those assigned by Hansen et al. [18,19] to a non-stoichiometric -~ SbVO4 phase with an indicative formula of SkS+ v3+,tz4+ [] o.1604 where the square denotes metal ion vacancies. Chemical v0.92 \" 0.28 \" 0.64 analysis data [11] are in agreement with this formula. Infrared (IR) characteriza- G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 229 tion of the sample [12,27] indicates the presence of small amounts of ot-Sb204 not revealed by the XRD data. The IR spectrum of the sample before activation, furthermore, shows the presence of VS+-oxide. This species for the most part disappears after the activation, reasonably due to the formation of VO2 in solid solution with the rutile-like vanadium-antimonate phase [18]. Further details on the characterization of these samples have been reported elsewhere [12,27]. Fourier-transform infrared (IR) spectra (resolution 2 cm-1) were recorded with a Perkin Elmer 1750 instrument in a quartz cell connected to grease-free evacuation and gas manipulation lines. The self-supporting disk technique was used. Before recording the spectra, the samples were treated with O2 at 720 K (lh) in order to clean the surface from organic contaminants, then cooled down to r.t. before evacuation of the O2. The sample was then evacuated at 370 K or 670 K in order to have an hydroxylated or partially dehydroxylated surface, respectively. Evacuation at temperatures higher than 670-720 K lead to a drastic cut off of IR transparency. Conventional methods were used to purify all reactants before their uses in the adsorption experiments. The background spectrum of the activated samples as well as that of the gas phase species were usually electronically subtracted from the spectra. A structural band of the catalyst at 1750 cm-1 (assigned to a combination band of the overtones of fundamental skeletal vibrations of V-Sb-oxide) was used as the internal refer- ence band for the normalization of the intensities of the bands as a function of the different treatments. The catalytic tests were carried out using an apparatus composed of (i) a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor, (ii) a section for the preparation of feed by mixing already calibrated mixtures of the single components in helium, (iii) a system for on-line gas-chromatographic (GC) analysis (two GCs equipped with a flame ionization and thermoconducibility detector, respectively) and (iv) a section for the analysis of NH3 conversion and HCN formation by absorption in appropriate solutions and titration [8,13,27]. Tests were made using 2-4 g of sample with particle dimensions in the 0.1-0.2 mm range and diluted in a 1:5 ratio using an inert support. The axial temperature profile was monitored by thermocouples inserted into the catalytic bed. Tests were made using the following feedstock: 7.5% propane and a O2/C3 ratio of 1.6; the NH3/C3 ratio was varied over a range from 0 to 1.6. 3. Results A V-Sb-oxide catalyst with a Sb:V ratio of 1.0 was used in this study, because its IR transparency is much better than that of samples with a higher ratio. Therefore, although better selectivities to acrylonitrile were observed in these catalysts for Sb:V > 1.0 [27,38], their use for a combined IR and flow reactor study is not advisable. Furthermore, catalytic data [27,38] also indicate 230 G. Centi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 that the overall selectivity to propene + acrylonitrile of the samples with Sb:V > 1.0 is analogous, although the relative proportion of the two products changes due to a depression of the side NH3 ~ N2 reaction. Therefore, the use of a sample with Sb:V = 1.0 is preferable to understand the role of ammonia chemisorbed species not only on the surface mechanism of acrylonitrile synthe- sis, but also on the side reactions. 3.1. Effect of ammonia on the reactivity in flow reactor conditions Both patent and kinetic data [13,14,17] indicate that a high concentration of propane and low 02 to C3H8 ratios are preferable to obtain higher selectivities from propane over V-Sb-oxides. The analysis of the effect of NH3 on the surface reactivity of VSbO was thus made in conditions analogous to those indicated as preferable [13,14,17]. A reaction temperature of 750 K was used for the tests, because it had been previously observed on the same catalyst that the selectivity to acrylonitrile passes through a maximum approximately at this temperature [27,38]. The effect of the NH3 to C3H8 ratio in the feed on the conversion of propane is shown in Fig. 1. Ammonia inhibits the rate of propane depletion especially for the lower amounts of ammonia in the feed. The effect of ammonia on the product distribution is summarized in Fig. 2. However, since the product distribution is also affected by conversion, the tests were made at a variable space-velocity in order to compare data at iso-conver- sion of propane (15%). In the absence of ammonia, the catalyst shows a low selectivity to partial oxidation products. Propene is the main reaction product, o c- o o w 40 I\"~ 30 ! \\/ 20 10 \\ '\\ Fig. 1.

When low amounts of ammonia are added to the feed, a considerable decrease in the formation of carbon oxides is observed with a parallel increase in the selectivity to propene as well as initially also in that to acrolein + acrylic acid. The formation of nitriles is also observed, but data show that for NH3/C3H8 ratios below 0.5-1.0 the main nitrile formed is acetonitrile and not acrylonitrile. For higher NH3/C3H8 ratios, acrylonitrile becomes the main product together with propene. It should also be noted that the selectivity to acrolein + acrylic acid, propene and acetonitrile passes through a maximum as a function of the ammonia concentration in the feed. 3.2. Ammonia chemisorption and transformation The IR spectrum of ammonia species formed upon contact at room tempera- ture (r.t.) of ammonia with VSbO (pretreatment at the lower temperature of evacuation to avoid dehydroxylation of the sample) is shown in Fig. 3 (spectrum a). The spectrum is characterized by the bands at 1609 and 1258 cm-J of ammonia coordinated on Lewis sites (~as and ~s, respectively [39,40]) and the bands at 1432 cm-1 and 1674 cm-1 (shoulder) of the ammonium ion (~as and ~s, respectively [39,40]). Although not well resolved, the corresponding VNH bands in the 3000-3400 cm-l region were also observed confirming the assignment. A weak band at 1106 cm-~ indicates the formation of small amounts of an ammonia species coordinated through H-bonding. This species readily disappears upon evacuation at r.t., whereas the ammonia species chemisorbed at Lewis and BrCnsted sites are more resistant to evacuation. Shown in Fig. 4 are the decreases in the relative intensities of the IR bands at 232 G.

The IR spectrum after contact at r.t. of a mixture of ammonia and 02 is shown in Fig. 3 (spectrum b). In comparison with the spectrum obtained in the same conditions, but in the absence of gaseous oxygen (spectrum a), a consider- able decrease in the intensities of the bands of ammonia chemisorbed at the Lewis sites (1609 cm-1 and 1258 cm-1) is observed.

G. Centi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 233 at progressively higher temperatures (370 K and 470 K in spectra c and d of Fig. 3, respectively) the relative intensity of the bands of ammonia chemisorbed at the Lewis acid sites increases. A weak band also appears at about 1150 cm-1 upon contact at 470 K (spectrum d of Fig. 3). This band (i) increases in intensity at higher temperatures of contact, (ii) was observed also after contact of ammonia with pure VzO5, (iii) disappears after treatment with pure oxygen and (iv) was also observed after various organic substances were put in contact with the catalyst [38,41]. A possible assignment is to the stretching frequency of a V=O group lying near to an oxygen vacancy created by removal of a bridging oxygen linked to the vanadium ion [9]. This suggests that ammonia reacts with bridging lattice oxygens to form N2 and HzO. Evidence for the formation of the latter, in fact, was obtained from the analysis of the spectrum of the gas phase, while no evidence was found for the formation of other possible products such as N~O and NO. When gaseous oxygen is present, the selective oxidation of ammonia reason- ably is higher for the possible reoxidation of the oxygen vacancies and thus a higher formation of water occurs as a by-product of the reaction. It is known that water may react with Lewis sites to form BrCnsted sites over various kind of oxides [42]. When VSbO is put in contact with a mixture of NH3 + 02, the higher formation of water due to the higher conversion of ammonia leads to the conversion of Lewis to BrCnsted sites. Therefore, the formation of ammonium ions only is detected instead of a mixture of ammonium ions and ammonia chemisorbed as such, when a mixture of NH3 + O2 is put in contact with the catalyst instead of using ammonia alone. At higher temperatures of contact, however, due to the high thermal stability of ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites (see Fig. 4), it is reasonable to expect an increase in the relative ratio of ammonia species chemisorbed at the Lewis and Brcnsted acid sites. The tests of ammonia chemisorption on VSbO thus indicate the following conclusions: (i) Ammonia may be converted to N2 even at room temperature by the catalyst when gaseous oxygen is present; partial reduction of the catalyst occurs as a consequence of the reaction. (ii) Ammonia chemisorbs both at Lewis and BrCnsted sites of VSbO, but the formation of ammonium ions occurs preferably when water is present and at low temperatures; no evidence was found, on the contrary, of the formation of dissociatively chemisorbed ammonia species (NH z-like) in either the presence or absence of oxygen. (iii) The relative amount of ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis sites increases with respect to that at Br~nsted sites with increasing temperature of interaction of ammonia with the catalyst. This is also caused by the higher thermal stability of the former species with respect to the latter species. It may thus be suggested that during the catalytic reaction of propane ammoxidation (temperatures of about 720-770 K; formation of large amounts of water as a by-product) both ammonium ions and ammonia species coordi- 234 G.

However, the thermal stability of the former is significantly lower than that of the latter which thus may be present in large amounts only when a large excess of ammonia is present in the gas phase. 3.3. Propane adsorption or coadsorption with ammonia The IR spectra obtained upon contact of VSbO with 4000 Pa propane at increasing temperatures (420 K, 470 K and 520 K) are shown in Fig. 5(spectra a-c, respectively). Already at 420 K, propane is oxidized to carbon oxides and water from the catalyst as shown by the growth of (i) intense bands at 1614 cm-1 (~OH) and in the 3000-3600 cm-1 region (VOH) of chemisorbed water, and (ii) weak bands at 2350 cm- 1 and 1420 cm- ~ due to physisorption of CO2 and formation of carbonate species, respectively, and (iii) by the appearance of a negative, broad and structured band with a maximum at 2040 cm-~. The same band at 2040 cm-1 was observed in V205 [43] and attributed to the first overtone of the Vv=o fundamental frequency. This negative band near 2040 cm-~ appears even at low temperatures of contact with propane (Fig. 5) indicating a rapid reduction of V--O groups. The vanadium species responsible for this band near 2040 cm-J may be assigned to a V-oxide species supported over the V-antimonate matrix [ 11,12]. At higher temperatures of contact, a band at 1145 cm-~ is also noted. According to the above discussion, this band indicates the removal of bridging lattice oxygen. Therefore, the data of Fig. 5 indicate that a low temperature a VS+-oxide species supported over the V-anti- monate matrix reacts with propane, but at higher temperature also bridging lattice oxygen of V-antimonate matrix are removed.

(b) or 470 K (c); or consecutive contact for 5 min of 1000 Pa propane and 2000 Pa 02 at 470 K (d) or 570 K (e). As the temperature of contact of the catalyst with propane increases, a series of other bands are observed in the spectra. They can be assigned to an acrylate species: 1530 cm-1 and 1435 cm-1 (Va~ and vs COO-), 1375 cm-1 and 1280 cm-I (~CH and Vcc), 1660 cm-1 (Vc=o coordinated at Lewis sites)and 1640 cm-~ (Vc_c). This acrylate species is stable upon evacuation up to relatively high temperatures (spectra d and e in Fig. 5) showing the strong chemisorption at the surface sites. The IR studies of propane and ammonia coadsorption are summarized in Figs. 6 and 7. Two types of sequences of experiments were done. In the first series (Fig. 6) ammonia was put in contact with the catalyst at high temperature to form mainly species chemisorbed at Lewis sites (see Fig. 4), whereas in the second series of experiments (Fig. 7) ammonia was chemisorbed at r.t. to form mainly species chemisorbed at BrCnsted sites. Upon evacuation to remove gaseous ammonia, both catalysts were then put in contact with propane or propane + O2 at increasing temperatures. In both cases weak bands at 2220 cm- ~ and 2280 cm- ~ (vcN band of a CN group chemisorbed at BrCnsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively) are observed upon contact with propane at high temperature. The assignment of these bands 236 G. Centi et al.// Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 IV i A\\ ; {\", \\~. f, I i Fig. 7. IR spectra after contact of VSbO with NH3 (1500 Pa, 5 rain, r.t.), subsequent evacuation and consecutive interaction with 2000 Pa propane for 1 min at 470 K (a), for 12 min at 470 K (b), for 18 min at 470 K (c), for 2 min at 570 K (d) and for 5 min at 570 K (e). was confirmed by IR tests of adsorption of acrylonitrile or acrylic acid + NH3 coadsorption experiments [38,41]. However, while in case B (NH3 preferentially coordinated at BrCnsted sites), the formation of chemisorbed acrylonitrile is already detected upon contact at 470 K (band at 2220 cm-l), higher tempera- tures are required in case A (about 570 K) where ammonia is chemisorbed mainly at Lewis acid sites. The progressive change in the relative intensities of the bands at 2220 and 2280 cm-1 with increasing temperature (Fig. 7) is due to the change in the chemisorption of acrylonitrile from BrCnsted to Lewis acid sites as a consequence of the stronger bond with the latter, the reactivity of which towards acrylonitrile, however, is inhibited at the lower temperatures by the stronger bond with ammonia. At the higher temperatures, ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites is oxidized by the catalyst to N2 making the Lewis acid sites free to chemisorb acrylonitrile. Furthermore, it may be noted in Fig. 7 that the intensity of the IR bands of ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites (1609 cm-Z) decreases faster than that relative to ammonia coordinated at BrCnsted sites (1432 cm-1) especially upon addition of oxygen (Fig. 6; spectra d and e), suggesting that the former species is oxidized faster. G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 237 The other bands in the spectra are in agreement with those expected from the overlapping of the relative spectra for pure ammonia or propane adsorption (see Figs. 3 and 5), indicating that no other significant chemisorbed species, apart from acrylonitrile, may be detected in propane + NH3 coadsorption experiments in addition to those evidenced in the separate adsorption of the two reactants. However, it may be noted that acrylate species appear to form in propane + NH3 coadsorption tests at slightly higher temperatures than in propane only tests (about 520 K and 420 K, respectively), further confirming the inhibition of propane conversion when ammonia is the first reactant to be put in contact with the catalyst. Propane and ammonia coadsorption experiments thus indicate that ammonia inhibits propane conversion by the catalyst and further suggest that the inhibition may be attributed to the strong chemisorption of ammonia at the Lewis acid sites suggested to be involved in the mechanism of alkane selective activation [31]. 3.4. Propene adsorption or coadsorption with ammonia Propene is the primary intermediate in the conversion of propane to acryloni- trile [2,7-10,13-15]. Experiments analogous to those with propane were there- fore made using this hydrocarbon, but due to its easier chemisorption already at low temperatures, better indications were obtained regarding the possible path- ways in the mechanism of ammoxidation. In the case of propane, instead, it was possible to observe only the more stable final product (an acrylate species) (Fig. 5), due to the necessity for an activated adsorption to convert an alkane. The IR spectra with VSbO after contact with propene and evacuation at r.t. shows clearly evident bands [38] at 1660, 1468 and 1455 (double), 1388 and 1372 (double), 1328, 1255, 1170, 1132 and 1101 cm-1, the last one very intense. The same bands are observed after adsorption of isopropanol alcohol and may be assigned to a mixture of an isopropoxylate species (1101 cm-l; vc_o) and coordinated acetone (intense band at 1660 cm-~; Vc=o); the latter assignment is confirmed by the analysis of the spectrum of acetone adsorbed over the same catalyst [41]. Analogous species were detected by adsorption of propene over vanadia - titania catalysts [44,45]. Additional weak bands at 1640 cm-1 and 1070 cm-1 are observed in the spectrum of propene in contact with the catalyst, but disappear after evacuation at r.t.. They can be assigned to vc = c and vc_o, respectively, of propene adsorbed in the form of allyl alcoholate. With increasing evacuation temperature, the bands associated with isopropox- ylate progressively decrease and disappear after evacuation at 390 K. Likewise, the bands of coordinated acetone increase in relative intensity up to about 430 K, and then decrease at higher temperatures. The spectrum of the sample evacuated at 430 K is dominated by an intense band near 1540 cm-1 plus other bands at 1438, 1660, 1420 and 1370 cm-~; the latter three bands are due to acetone which has not been completely transformed.

Other weak bands at 1640 cm-t and 1375 cm-1 (vc_c and 8cH, respectively) indicate the presence of an acrylate species and at 1360 cm-1 (~3) of an acetate. Propene thus readily reacts at r.t with VSbO to form an isopropoxylate species which then may develop along two possible pathways: (i) the first route (attack from surface hydroxyl groups) gives products of carbon chain degrada- tion (acetone plus CH4) and (ii) the second route occurring at higher tempera- tures gives rise first to an allyl alcoholate species which then transforms to acrolein and acrylate. The second routes thus involves nucleophilic oxidative attack by lattice oxygen. The results of the propene and ammonia coadsorption experiments are summarized in Figs. 8 and 9. Two series of tests were made. In the first series of tests (Fig. 8) propene was put in contact at r.t. with the catalyst for 5 rain, then removed by evacuation at r.t.; later anmaonia was put in contact for 2 rain at r.t. and then removed by evacuation.

Spectra were then recorded at increasing temperatures under vacuum. In the second series of experiments (Fig. 9) propene and ammonia together were put in contact with the catalyst and the spectra recorded at increasing tempera- tures of contact with the mixture of C3H6 + NH3. In the first experiments the change in coadsorbed species was studied, whereas in the second type of tests the effect of the presence of propene and ammonia also in the gas phase was analyzed. The two procedures of coadsorption experiments give different results. The more remarkable evidence is the absence of formation of a weak band near 2220 cm-1 (vcN of acrylonitrile chemisorbed at BrCnsted sites) in the tests in the absence of ammonia in the gas phase (Fig. 8), notwithstanding the disappear- ance of Vcn bands. The VcN band forms instead in the parallel experiments, but in the presence of ammonia in the gas phase (Fig. 9). When ammonia is absent in the gas phase, the amount of ammonia chemisorbed (mainly in the form of ammonium ion; strong band at about 1430 cm-1) rapidly decreases with increasing temperature due to conversion to N2 + H 2(compare spectra in Figs. 8 and 9) with a consequent freeing of the BrOnsted sites blocked by reaction 240 G. Centi et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 with NH3. The presence of ammonia in the gas phase (Fig. 9) instead inhibits this process. Other bands in the spectra are consistent with those observed after chemisorption of the pure components and indicates that in the absence of ammonia in the gas phase surface species develop with formation mainly of chemisorbed acetone and acetic acid, whereas in the presence of ammonia in the gas phase the formation mainly of chemisorbed acrolein and acrylic acid is observed. This indicates that the presence of ammonia in the gas phase changes the surface acidity characteristics of VSbO catalysts, thus modifying the surface reactivity. 4. Discussion The data reported in Figs. 1 and 2 show that the presence of ammonia in the feed significantly modifies the surface reactivity and not only the nature of the reaction products. In fact, (i) the activity of the VSbO catalyst toward the conversion of propane decreases and (ii) the selectivity to partial oxidation products is enhanced considerably, thus depressing the formation of carbon oxides. Furthermore, the product distribution changes as a function of the concentration of ammonia in the feed (Fig. 2). There are basically four kind of possible explanations to interpret these catalytic results: (1) The addition of ammonia decreases the amount of surface oxygens due to the presence of a faster reaction with respect to that of propane ammoxidation: 2NH3 + 1.502 ----> N2 + 3H20 which modifies the surface oxidation characteristics of the VSbO catalyst, decreasing its activity but increasing the selectivity to partial oxidation products. (2) The superior selectivity to partial oxidation products in ammoxidation with respect to oxidation is due to the lower rate of consecutive oxidation of the products obtained in the two cases, acrylonitrile and acrolein + acrylic acid, respectively. (3) Ammonia reacts with surface sites transforming them to different, more selective sites and in particular to metal-imido species (M=NH) analogous to that indicated for Bi-molybdate catalysts [5]. (4) The chemisorption of ammonia at the surface acid sites modifies their reactivity towards chemisorption of reactants (propane, 02) and their catalytic action on the mechanism of transformation of adsorbed organic species. When a competitive reaction such as that of ammonia oxidation to N2 subtracts the surface oxygens involved in the oxidation of the organic, an increase in the selectivity to partial oxidation products may be expected on the basis of kinetic reasons and models of the dynamics of surface sites [46]. It is G. Centi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 241 basically a consequence of the different number of oxygens involved for the various steps of the reaction. The synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane passes through the formation of propene as the main detectable reaction intermediate [1-4]. One oxygen atom is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, three oxygen atoms for the step from propene to acryloni- trile, 7.5 oxygen atoms for the oxidation of acrylonitrile to CO2 + N2 + H20 and ten for the complete oxidation of propane. Therefore, it may be expected that the selectivity to acrylonitrile passes through a maximum for V-Sb-oxide catalysts with increasing rate of NH3 ~ N2 reaction, even taking into account that ammonia is also a coreactant for acrylonitrile synthesis. Experimental data instead show an inverse linear relationship between selectivity to acrylonitrile and rate of the NH 3 ~ N2 reaction [27]. Therefore, although the first hypothesis may not be completely rejected, there is no experimental evidence which supports its role as the principal factor governing the reactivity of the VSbO catalyst in propane ammoxidation. The second hypothesis is based on the possible differences in the rate of consecutive reaction of acrylonitrile and acrolein + acrylic acid; propene, in fact, is formed as the main product is both cases (Fig. 2). However, data on the selectivity as a function of the NH3/C3H8 ratio in the feed (Fig. 2) show that for inlet ratios lower than about 1.0, acrylonitrile is not the primary product, notwithstanding a significant depression in the formation of carbon oxides. Furthermore, this hypothesis does not explain the decrease in catalyst activity with increasing ammonia concentration in the feed. Therefore, the second hypothesis also is not supported by experimental evidences. The third hypothesis is based on a modification of the surface sites in analogy with that proposed for Bi-molybdate catalysts active in propene ammoxidation [5]. However, transient catalytic tests [9], X-ray photoelectron data [8,14] and IR studies did not provide evidence supporting this hypothesis of the formation of a stable metal-imido species. A metal-imido species (V = NH) is expected, for example, to fall in the 1000-1200 cm-~ range, due to the isoelectronic character of the imido species with oxygen and the higher charge density at the nitrogen with respect to oxygen [47]. IR data instead show the formation of ammonia species chemisorbed at Lewis and Brcnsted sites (Fig. 3) up to high temperatures of interaction of NH3 with the catalyst. Furthermore, IR data also indicate that these chemisorbed ammonia species react with propene or propane to give acrylonitrile. Therefore, the experimental data do not support the hypothesis that the formation of metal-imido species is the key factor which modifies the surface selective behavior of VSbO in the ammoxidation versus oxidation reaction. IR data instead indicate a role of chemisorbed ammonia species in the modification of the surface reactivity of VSbO and in particular (i) of ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites in the step of propane activation and (ii) of ammonium ions formed by reaction of NH3 with BrCnsted acid sites in the 242 G. Centi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 inhibition of the reactivity of the Br~nsted sites themselves in catalyzing unselective side reactions. The data of Figs. 8 and 9 show that propene, intermediate from propane to acrylonitrile, may be converted along two competi- tive pathways, the first one with carbon chain breakage and the second one selective to acrylonitrile. The first pathway leads to the formation of acetic acid which, in the presence of ammonia, is readily converted to acetonitrile. This explains why at the low ammonia concentrations in the feed (Fig. 2), the selectivity to acetonitrile is higher than that to acrylonitrile, whereas the opposite effect is present for the higher ammonia concentrations. IR data, therefore, correlate well with the catalytic behavior observed in flow reactor conditions. IR data on propene + NH3 coadsorption experiments also indicate that the route leading to carbon chain breakage and acetonitrile formation, occurs preferentially at the lower temperatures, whereas the pathway to acrylonitrile is favoured at higher temperatures. In agreement, catalytic data [38] showed that the acetonitrile to acrylonitrile ratio decreases as the reaction temperature increases. Coadsorption experiments of acrylic acid and ammonia [38] indicate that the inhibition of Br~nsted reactivity converting them into ammonium ions also plays a role in the transformation of adsorbed acrylate species. Coordinated acrylic acid and ammonia react readily at low temperature to form acrylamide further transformed at higher temperatures to acrylonitrile. However, when free Br~nsted sites are present, decomposition of the amide to free acrylic acid + NH3 occurs. The free acid is unstable and is readily further converted to carbon oxides. The transformation of BrCnsted sites to ammonium ions also plays a key role in this step in determining the surface selectivity and thus ammonia not only acts as coreagent. 5. Conclusions The analysis of the effect of ammonia on the surface reactivity of VSbO indicates that both the reactivity and selectivity characteristics of the catalyst are considerably modified by the presence of NH3 in the gas phase. Ammonia coordinates as such or as ammonium ions with the surface of the catalyst in relative amounts which depend on the temperature at the time of contact and the hydroxylation state of the catalyst. Coadsorption experiments of propane or propene and ammonia showed that both chemisorbed species influence the surface reactivity, and in particular, (i) ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites primarily influences the rate of propane activation and (ii) ammonia chemisorbed at Br~nsted acid sites inhibits their action in catalyzing side reactions, lowering the selectivity to acrylonitrile. Even though other effects reasonably contribute in the modification of the intrinsic reactivity/selectivity of the VSbO catalyst, analysis of the various G. Centi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 225-244 243 factors indicates a primary role of the chemisorbed ammonia species. The good agreement with the catalytic behavior observed in flow reactor studies further supports this interpretation. Therefore, it can be concluded that both the nature and the amount of the chemisorbed ammonia species determine the intrinsic surface reactivity and selectivity of VSbO catalysts in the synthesis of acryloni- trile.

Tel. +39-90-393134, fax. +39-90-391518 The influence of ammonia on the reactivity of a V—Sb-oxide catalyst in propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN) was studied by infrared spectroscopy and flow reactor tests. Ammonia coordinates as such or as ammonium ions on the catalyst surface in relative amounts which depend on both the temperature at the time of contact and the hydroxylation state of the catalyst. The two chemisorbed species influence both the surface reactivity and the pathways of the reaction in propane ammoxidation. NH3 chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites inhibits the activation of propane differently from that chemisorbed on Brønsted sites. The formation of the latter species, however, inhibits the reactivity of the Brønsted sites in catalyzing various side reactions which decrease the selectivity to ACN. The results of the infrared study are in good agreement with the change in surface reactivity observed in flow reactor tests as a function of the concentration of ammonia in the feed. Both the nature and the amount of the chemisorbed ammonia species thus determine the intrinsic surface reactivity and selectivity of V—Sb-oxide catalysts in the synthesis of acrylonitrile.
