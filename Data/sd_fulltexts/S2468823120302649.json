Graphical abstract Aiming at a simple and effective way to activate the recycled cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries for air cleaning, LiCoO2 was synthesized and treated by water for airborne benzene removal. Compared with the pristine sample, whose benzene conversion was ∼20 % at 400 °C, the water-treated one could fulfill 100 % of conversion for 431 ppm of benzene at 300 °C under 120 L g−1 h−1 of space velocity. Furthermore, the water treatment process also worked effectively with the commercialized LiCoO2. Characterization results showed that surface oxygen, i.e., chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen, only acted as benzene adsorption sites inert towards benzene oxidation whereas bulk lattice oxygen was reactive for oxidation reaction. Water treatment played two roles in updating the LiCoO2 surface properties. One was to remove the excessive Li2CO3 and the thus-generated sites could adsorb gaseous oxygen, which was catalyzed to directly oxidize the gas-phase benzene into surface by-products at low temperatures (150−200 °C) following the Elay-Rideal pathway. Another more important role was to expose the bulk lattice oxygen by eliminating the surface oxygen species. The thus-exposed bulk lattice oxygen worked at high temperatures (250−400 °C) and could effectively oxidize the adsorbed benzene following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Keywords Catalytic oxidation VOCs Benzene Lithium cobalt oxides Surface and lattice oxygen 1 Introduction Catalysts are required for a variety of applications and researchers are increasingly challenged to find cost effective and environmentally benign catalysts to use. For the catalytic oxidation of airborne benzene, one of the notorious volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in polluted air, extensive studies on the supported noble metals [1–8] have been carried out due to their very high activity. For supported precious metal catalysts, the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) was generally desired for high VOCs oxidation efficiency. Li et al. [9] constructed partially confined Pt nanoparticles in the mesopores of micro-sized CeO2 (Pt/CeO2-MM) for benzene oxidation and found that a novel SMSI in Pt/CeO2-MM greatly improved the activity of interfacial lattice oxygen to destruct benzene. However, the deficiencies such as high cost, natural scarcity and easy poisoning impede the large-scale industrial application of noble metal catalysts. Therefore, great efforts have been made to lower the content of precious metal and use the relatively cheaper non-noble metal oxides to achieve high activity [10]. Deng et al. [11] adopted a hydrothermal method to create a defect-enriched Ag-MnO x (mole ratio of Mn/Ag = 39.7) catalyst for benzene oxidation. The large number of active oxygen species resulted from the high amount of oxygen vacancies offered the Ag-MnO x sample a high benzene oxidation efficiency comparable to that of 1 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Li et al. investigated the influences of hydrothermal temperature [12] and the tunnel K+ concentration [13] on catalytic benzene oxidation by cryptomelane-type MnO2, and correlated the benzene oxidation activity with the concentration of oxygen vacancies. They also investigated the effect of the morphology of δ-MnO2 on benzene oxidation [14]. In addition to anion vacancy, Li and co-workers discovered that cation vacancy, such as Co2+ defects inducing the formation of reactive lattice oxygen, massively enhanced the photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4 for benzene degradation [15]. Chen’s group reported several papers on the synthesis of metal oxide composites from the corresponding layered double hydroxide (LDH), such as CoMnAl [16] and CuCoAl [17]. Our group synthesized several MnO2 catalysts [18–20] that could more efficiently oxidize benzene than the reported counterparts at identical reaction temperatures. Besides, the oxides of V [21], Ti [21], Cu [22,23], Mo [24], W [24] and Ce [25] etc. were also studied for benzene oxidation. In addition to the conventional catalysts, environmental pollution control with novel materials is highly desirable. As reported in our previous studies [26,27], lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), constituting the cathode materials of spent lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, was proposed as a potential candidate for future application. However, the pristine sample without any modification was too inert to be used, and its surface properties needed to be updated to provide strong sites for gaseous benzene adsorption and active vacancies for gaseous oxygen activation. The nitric acid treatment method [26] and the co-modification by Ag and phosphotungstic acid [27] were effective to equip the LiCoO2 with strong benzene adsorption sites and increase the reducibility of the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen, thus lowering the reaction temperature for complete benzene oxidation by at least 100 °C. So far, the frequently used routes for modifying the surface properties of VOCs oxidation catalysts include regulating the reaction conditions (i.e., precursors, synthetic temperature, ratio of reactants, pH value, and so on), lattice doping and replacement of interlayer or tunnel cations with foreign atoms, and reduction by hydrogen, which would lead to favorable morphologies and exposed facets and reactive oxygen species, etc. Although effective, these processes are not very suitable for the large-batch processing of finished materials, such as the cycled LiCoO2 powder from spent Li-ion batteries. Herein, a simple and facile water treatment procedure was newly put forward to promote gaseous benzene oxidation over the synthetic LiCoO2. The samples before and after water treatment were comparatively studied with systematic characterizations and designed experiments. The benzene conversion achieved by the water-treated sample was a giant step forward from the negligible activity of the pristine one and the exposed bulk lattice oxygen by eliminating the surface oxygen species via water washing was responsible for the significantly improved reactivity. The water treatment method could also be extended to the commercialized LiCoO2. This study not only proposed a simple and effective way to activate the LiCoO2 materials for environmental application but also clarified the roles of different oxygen species in benzene oxidation for better understanding the reaction mechanisms. This knowledge provides useful guidelines for the future application of the recycled cathode materials from spent lithium-ion batteries in the total oxidation of VOCs at low temperatures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The pristine LiCoO2 (LCO) was synthesized via the thermal reaction between Li2CO3 and CoCO3 according to our previous studies [26,27]. Briefly, the powders of Li2CO3 and CoCO3 with a molar ratio of 1:2 were well mixed and ground in an agate mortar until they could not be differentiated by naked eyes. Then the mixture was transferred into a furnace and heated to 500 °C with a ramp of 2 °C min−1 in static air and kept at 500 °C for 6 h, followed by naturally cooling down to ambient temperature. The water-treated sample (H2O-LCO) was prepared as follows. The LCO powder was added into deionized water (m LCO:m water = 1:20) and the suspension was agitated with a magnetic stirrer in a water bath thermostated at 50 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the slurry was separated by centrifuge and the obtained solid was subjected to successive washing and centrifuging for three sets. The wet product was dried at 105 °C for 3 h. In this study, Cr-modified samples were studied as well for catalytic benzene oxidation in order to provide more information on the catalytically active sites. CrLCOiwp was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using Cr(NO3)3·9H2O as precursor and the LCO as support. The impregnated powder was calcined at 500 °C for 3 h after drying at 105 °C for 3 h. Similarly, CrLCOH2Oiwp was acquired using the H2O-LCO as support. CrLCOop was prepared by one-pot process, wherein the well-mixed Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Li2CO3 and CoCO3 solid was thermally treated under the same conditions as the synthesis of LCO. CrLCOsg was prepared through citric acid-assisted sol-gel procedure [28]. Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Li2CO3 and CoCO3 were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred at 60 °C for 15 min; then excess citric acid solid was slowly added into the mixture under vigorous stirring. After another 30 min, the resulting slurry was fully dried at 100 °C for 21 h, followed by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. The nominal weight percentage of Cr was ∼0.7 % in all the Cr-modified catalysts. The CrLCOiwp and CrLCOop samples, which were further treated with water, were denoted as H2O-CrLCOiwp and H2O-CrLCOop, respectively. All the as-synthesized catalysts were ground, tableted, crushed and sieved into pellets of 40–60 mesh in order to reduce the pressure drop during catalytic measurements [29]. The surface and bulk properties of the catalysts were investigated via comprehensive characterizations, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), temperature programmed desorption of adsorbed benzene (C6H6-TPD), O2-TPD, temperature programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). For details of the instruments, procedures and parameters used for the characterizations, see the electronic supplementary information. 2.2 Catalytic benzene oxidation The catalytic performance was evaluated in a fixed bed quartz tube reactor (i.d. = 6 mm) heated by a tubular furnace. Unless otherwise stated, about 0.1 g of catalyst was loaded. A gas mixture composed of 407−467 ppm of benzene and balance simulated air (20 v% O2 + 80 v% N2) was fed into the reactor, and the total flow rate was 200 mL min−1 controlled by mass flow controllers, equivalent to a space velocity of 120 L g−1 h−1. The reaction temperature was measured and controlled by a thermocouple and the temperature increasing rate was set at 5 °C min−1. The benzene concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the reactor were measured by an online VOCs detector (MiniRAE 3000, USA) and benzene conversion was defined as the decreased percentage of benzene concentration. It is worth pointing out that the outlet benzene concentration did not increase during the heating process in all cases, indicating that adsorption was not the main cause for gaseous benzene removal. Effects of the concomitant water vapor and the pre-adsorbed SO2 and NO2 on benzene removal were discussed as well based on the procedures described in our previous study [27]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Fundamental characterizations of the catalysts The crystal structures of the catalysts before and after water treatment were examined by XRD, with the results shown in Fig. 1 A. The standard LiCoO2 peaks (JCPDS No. 44-0145) were clearly observed over the LCO with no observable impurities, and the numbers marked over the diffraction peaks are related to the corresponding crystal facets. The LCO showed a single diffraction around 2θ = 66° ({110} plane), asserting the spinel structure [30]. Water treatment at 50 °C for 6 h (H2O-LCO) did not alter the phase structure and the crystallite sizes of the LCO and H2O-LCO estimated from the Scherrer formula were 20 and 22 nm, respectively. The surface functional groups of the LCO and H2O-LCO were investigated by ATR, with the corresponding IR spectra reproduced in Fig. 1B. The prominent difference between the spectra of the LCO and H2O-LCO lay in the significant weakening of the IR peaks at 1487, 1433 and 866 cm−1 (◆), which are assigned to the characteristic vibrations of the C O 3 2- in Li2CO3 [31,32]. Li2CO3 might be excessive with respect to CoCO3 in the starting reagents of LiCoO2 and the residual Li2CO3 was dissolved in water during water treatment process. However, the Li2CO3 was just slightly excessive based on the following calculation. When 1.478 g of Li2CO3 (0.02 mol) and 4.758 g of CoCO3 (0.04 mol) were mixed and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h, ∼3.7 g of product (≈ 0.04 mol LiCoO2) was obtained, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the equation Li2CO3(s) + 2CoCO3(s) + 0.5O2(g) → 2LiCoO2(s) + 3CO2(g). Thus, only a very small amount of Li2CO3 was unreacted during the synthesis of the LCO. One of the possible reasons why no peaks characteristic of Li2CO3 were detected in the XRD profile of the LCO (Fig. 1A) was the low content of Li2CO3. Effect of the wash-off of the residual Li2CO3 on benzene oxidation activity will be discussed in Section 3.2.1. The chemical environment and states of the surface elements were characterized by XPS, with the Li 1s, Co 2p, O 1s and C 1s spectra respectively exhibited in Fig. 2 A, B, C and D. One Li 1 s band centered at 53.9 eV appeared in both LCO and H2O-LCO and is in accordance with the reported binding energy of the Li element in LiCoO2 [33]. The identical Li 1s spectra before and after water treatment further confirm the very small amount of remnant Li2CO3 in the LCO. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the Co 2p spectra of the LCO and H2O-LCO, either. Two main lines at 779.5 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 794.5 eV (Co 2p1/2) together with the respective satellite peaks at 789.6 eV and 804.6 eV suggest that the Co species mainly existed in trivalent state [34]. The O 1s spectra of both samples consisted of two kinds of oxygen species. The Oα around 531.0eV and Oβ at 529.2eV are attributed to the oxygen species from the surface adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen, respectively [35,36]. Moreover, the Oα peak of the H2O-LCO shifted to lower position by 0.3eV in comparison with that of the LCO, implying the changed chemical environment of the Oα species by water treatment. With regard to the surface carbon species, the carbonates [37] disappeared over the H2O-LCO owing to the washing-off by water treatment, agreeing well with the ATR measurements (Fig. 1B). The morphological changes of the catalysts before and after water treatment were observed by SEM, with the images exhibited in Fig. 3 A–D. Overall, the untreated sample was presented in a coral-like appearance (Fig. 3A) and it can be seen from the enlarged view (Fig. 3B) that the “coral” actually contained two types of particles as the inset illustrated, i.e., the polygon structure (dark color) as the base, on which the small spheres (bright color, ∼15 nm) grew. The coral-like morphology was maintained over the H2O-LCO but broke into smaller pieces with better dispersion (Fig. 3C). The particle size of the H2O-LCO catalyst was ∼12 nm (Fig. 3D), similar to that of the LCO. TEM and HRTEM observations were performed to access the information of dimensions and exposed facets of the catalysts, with the images reproduced in Fig. 3E–H. As shown in Fig. 3E and G and the corresponding insets, the polygon structure was also detected by TEM and the particle dispersion was significantly improved by water treatment, consistent with the SEM results. In terms of exposed facets, clear and sharp lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of ∼0.46 nm were distinguished over the LCO (Fig. 3F), conforming to the LiCoO2 {003} plane. Meanwhile, a slightly narrower lattice spacing of 0.45 nm also existed over the pristine LiCoO2 sample, which might be due to the lattice distortion causing the slight deviation of the {003} d-spacing of the as-synthesized LiCoO2 in this study from that of the perfect LiCoO2 crystal, and researchers have observed similar phenomenon [38]. However, besides the LiCoO2 {003} facet, the H2O-LCO also exposed a new lattice spacing of 0.196 nm, belonging to the LiCoO2 {104} facet. Lu and co-workers [39] investigated the reactive surfaces of LiCoO2 for oxygen evolution reaction and identified the LiCoO2 {104} plane as a more active surface than the LiCoO2 {101} facet. Therefore, in this study the different exposed facets resulted from water treatment might also result in a higher benzene oxidation activity. Compared with the untreated sample, the lattice fringes of the H2O-LCO became much blurred and distorted, indicating the presence of crystal defects over the H2O-LCO. The HRTEM image also confirmed this by displaying obvious disordered atomic arrangement (marked with yellow dashed cycles in Fig. 3H) in the water-treated particles at a long-range distance. 3.2 Catalytic performance for benzene oxidation 3.2.1 From inert to highly active induced by water treatment Fig. 4 A shows the benzene removal curves as a function of reaction time over the pristine and water-treated LiCoO2 samples. For both catalysts, benzene removal increased with increasing reaction temperature. The pristine one (LCO) was almost inert towards benzene oxidation when the temperature was lower than 250 °C and only about 20 % of removal efficiency could be obtained even at a very high temperature of 400 °C. However, the water-treated one (H2O-LCO) exhibited a dramatically enhanced catalytic performance with respect to the LCO. After the LCO was treated in water at 50 °C for 6 h, the benzene removal at 250 °C rose up to ∼52 % at the beginning and then gradually dropped to ∼43 % at 40 min, and complete removal of benzene was achieved at 300 °C and above. These results demonstrate that the facile and simple water treatment procedure is effective to elevate the benzene oxidation activity of the LiCoO2 material. Furthermore, the H2O-LCO also showed relatively higher activity than the LCO in the low-temperature range (150−200 °C), but the catalyst was gradually deactivated probably due to the accumulation of oxidation by-products over the catalyst surface [2,17]. For future studies, there is still room for further improvement in the catalytic performance of the H2O-LCO. In addition to developing the more effective structural modification methods, taking advantage of the free radicals generated by the peroxymonosulfate/LiCoO2 protocol to degrade VOCs at ambient temperature is also worth trying, as enlightened by Huang et al. [40]. Based on the ATR results (Fig. 1B) that the residual Li2CO3 was leached off from the LCO during water treatment and according to our previous study [26] that Li2CO3 was barely active towards benzene oxidation, the elimination of Li2CO3 would thereby contribute to the improved catalytic performance of the H2O-LCO. In order to experimentally determine whether the greatly enhanced benzene oxidation activity of the H2O-LCO was closely related to the wash-off of the Li2CO3 residues, benzene oxidation reaction was also carried out with the Li2CO3-H2O-LCO sample, which was prepared by mechanically mixing the H2O-LCO with Li2CO3 (Li2CO3 was firstly heated at 500 °C for 6 h). As shown in Fig. S1, the benzene removal by the Li2CO3-H2O-LCO was merely slightly decreased (by less than 10 %) in comparison with the H2O-LCO, confirming that the wash-off of the residual Li2CO3 had a small impact on benzene oxidation and the more important role of water treatment was the surface modification of the LCO, which will be discussed in Section 3.3. In addition to the synthesized LiCoO2, it is necessary to extend the water-enhanced catalysis to the real cathode materials of Li-ion batteries. However, due to the limited conditions of the university lab (recycling and dismantling used batteries require large machineries), a commercialized LiCoO2 (CLCO) sample from a domestic supplier (Aladdin Company) was studied instead. As shown in Fig. 4A, although the H2O-CLCO was obviously inferior to the H2O-LCO for benzene oxidation, the benzene conversion achieved by the H2O-CLCO was really a big step forward from the negligible activity of the pristine CLCO, indicating the potential of applying the simple water treatment process to improve the air benzene removal by the recycled LiCoO2 from discarded electronic devices. 3.2.2 Recyclability of the H2O-LCO and effects of space velocity and the co-existing water vapor, SO2 & NO2 The recycling property of a benzene oxidation catalyst is also an important index to determine its suitability for practical application. Therefore, the used H2O-LCO after reaction in Fig. 4A was purged by 160 mL min−1 of simulated air at 400 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to ambient temperature and stored overnight. Benzene oxidation was started again the next day over this used sample, with the result displayed in Fig. 4B. Compared with the fresh LCO, the recycled one suffered from deactivation at temperatures lower than 350 °C. The sample after the second usage was regenerated by the aforementioned procedure and then stored at ambient temperature for 7 days. When the benzene-polluted air was fed into the same catalyst for the third time (Fig. 4B), benzene removal was not decreased in the temperature range of 150−250 °C with respect to the second run whereas the benzene removal at 300 °C was reduced to ∼83 % from ∼93 %, implying the catalyst poisoning during daily storage. Despite this, complete benzene removal was still fulfilled at 350 °C and above in all three cases above. The effect of space velocity (by changing the catalyst weight) on benzene oxidation over the H2O-LCO was investigated in Fig. 4C and the value of 120 L g−1 h−1 was selected as the basis. As the space velocity was decreased to 80 L g−1 h−1, the benzene removal at 250 °C was initially improved to ∼92 % and gradually faded to ∼79 % at 40 min; however, increasing space velocity to 240 L g−1 h−1 led benzene removal to significantly lower values, i.e., ∼27 % (at 40 min), ∼46 % and ∼70 % at 250, 300 and 350 °C, respectively. The residence time of reaction gas on the packed catalyst is inversely proportional to space velocity and the longer (shorter) the residence time is, the higher (lower) the benzene removal is. Compared with some of the reported counterparts in literatures, the H2O-LCO sample also exhibited superior benzene oxidation activity. For example, the TiO2 supported vanadia catalyst possessed ∼45 % and ∼95 % of conversion for 100 ppm of benzene at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively, under 60 L g−1 h−1 of space velocity [21]; the Al pillared clays supported MnCe sample achieved ∼40 % and ∼90 % of conversion for 130−160 ppm of benzene at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively, under 60 L g−1 h−1 of space velocity [41]. Water and other contaminants such as SO2 and NO2 are inevitably present in benzene-polluted air. Hence, effects of water vapor and pre-adsorbed SO2 and NO2 on benzene oxidation over the LCO and H2O-LCO were comparatively studied. As depicted in Fig. 4D, introducing 2.3 v% of water vapor reduced benzene removal to around 75 % from ∼96 % in the dry-gas reaction, resulted from the competitive adsorption of water vapor with benzene and O2 molecules on the catalytically active sites [42]. On the other hand, according to the study of Chen et al. [43], the catalytic oxidation of toluene followed the sequential steps of toluene→intermediate→CO2 with the second step consuming more oxygen. As a result, the reduced oxygen concentration due to water introduction was more negative to the transformation of intermediates to CO2, leading to the accumulation of oxidation by-products over the catalyst surface and finally catalyst deactivation. When the feed gas was switched back to dry gas, benzene removal could be recovered to as high as ∼96 %, supporting that the water poisoning was reversible in this study. There was no deactivation observed during multiple reactions with alternative humidities. Moreover, in the cases where SO2 and water were firstly adsorbed on catalyst surface before benzene oxidation reactions (Fig. 4E), the benzene oxidation activity of the H2O-LCO was significantly jeopardized with respect to the case where no pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O existed (Fig. 4A) and less than 40 % of benzene was removed even at 350 °C; on the contrary, the presence of pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O greatly promoted benzene oxidation by the LCO in the whole tested temperatures. For example, the benzene removal at 350 °C was 20–30 % higher in the presence of pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O. The difference of the catalytic behaviors between the LCO and H2O-LCO is likely ascribed to their different surface properties. According to our previous study [27], the pre-adsorbed SO2 would be more easily oxidized into surface sulfates over the relatively active benzene oxidation catalyst and the sulfates would occupy the reaction sites, thus leading to catalyst deactivation. As shown in Fig. 4F, for the H2O-LCO, NO2 imposed a negative impact on its benzene oxidation activity as well but to a less extent than the pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O did. Nevertheless, totally different from the positive influence of the pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O, the pre-adsorbed NO2·xH2O was not conductive to benzene oxidation over the LCO, and benzene oxidation was slightly hampered by the pre-adsorbed NO2·xH2O in comparison with the clean LCO surface (Fig. 4A). It can be seen from the above discussion that the pristine LiCoO2 was more resistant to the concomitant air pollutants than the water-treated sample and further effort will be made to improve the anti-deactivation properties of the H2O-LCO. 3.3 Advanced experiments and characterizations for understanding the reaction mechanism As a brief summary of the previous sections, the wash-off of the residual Li2CO3 had a small impact on benzene oxidation and the surface modification of the LCO by water treatment is suggested to be the decisive factor for the greatly increased activity of the H2O-LCO. In this section, the modified surface properties of the H2O-LCO were studied in depth from the perspectives of reaction sites and the reactivity of oxygen species. 3.3.1 Reaction sites In this study, chromium ion (Cr3+) was adopted as the plaster of active sites because it could selectively adhere onto specific sites to influence the catalytic activity. The selection of Cr3+ ion was totally by chance, merely because Cr species, which belong to the low-cost transition metal oxide, are commonly used as the active component for the removal of VOCs in literature [44,45]. Benzene oxidation over the Cr-modified catalysts is depicted in Fig. 5 . Compared with the H2O-LCO, the H2O-CrLCOiwp and H2O-CrLCOop displayed inferior benzene removal efficiencies when the reaction temperature was from 250 °C to 400 °C while comparable benzene removal was fulfilled by the H2O-CrLCOiwp and H2O-CrLCOop in the range of 150−200 °C, demonstrating that there were two kinds of reaction sites over the LCO, i.e., S H and S L respectively working at high (250−400 °C) and low (150−200 °C) temperatures, and the Cr species were more inclined to bind with the S H. What is more, various methods were applied to introduce Cr into the LCO (CrLCO) in this study and regardless of the synthetic ways, all the CrLCO samples (CrLCOiwp, CrLCOop and CrLCOsg) exhibited higher benzene removal in the high temperature range (250−400 °C) and similar catalytic activity in the low range (150−200 °C) in comparison with the LCO, further testifying that the Cr species favorably interacted with the S H of the LCO. The combined Cr-S H shielded the S H from being activated by water treatment, thus resulting in a worse performance than the H2O-LCO. The property of the S L over the H2O-LCO was altered by water treatment, as seen from the declined benzene oxidation activity of the CrLCOH2Oiwp in the range of 150−200 °C with respect to the H2O-LCO, indicating that the Cr species could also suppress the activity of the S L over the H2O-LCO. C6H6-TPD was then carried out for a better understanding about the benzene oxidation sites of the catalysts, with the results shown in Fig. 6 . During benzene adsorption stage (Fig. 6A), the outlet benzene concentration from the H2O-LCO (solid blue curve) dropped to a smaller value than the LCO (solid red curve), manifesting the larger benzene adsorption capacity of the H2O-LCO. The oxidation of gaseous pollutants preferentially took place over the surface that could provide abundant sites for adsorption [46]. Afterwards, the desorption of adsorbed benzene was performed in N2 with increasing temperature (Fig. 6B). For the LCO, only one large benzene desorption peak was detected around 420 °C (solid red curve); however, when the benzene adsorption time was prolonged to 2 h, not only the 420 °C peak became larger (solid gray curve) but also another small peak evolved at ∼85 °C (inset). In addition, after the LCO was subject to N2 pre-treatment at 500 °C for 1 h prior to benzene adsorption, the low-temperature benzene desorption peak remained and shifted to 130 °C (identical to the benzene desorption temperature on Li2CO3, solid green curve) whereas the high-temperature peak disappeared (dashed red curve). Therefore, the benzene desorption at low and high temperatures over the LCO is likely attributed to the benzene adsorbed on the Li2CO3 sites and oxygen sites, respectively. The oxygen sites were the main reservoir for benzene adsorption, as indicated from the remarkably larger amount of desorbed benzene from the oxygen sites (Fig. 6B) and the much less decreasing extent of outlet benzene concentration from the N2-pretreated sample during benzene adsorption (Fig. 6A). Gaseous benzene preferentially adsorbed on the oxygen sites till near saturation, and then began to adsorb on the Li2CO3 sites. Thus, no benzene was desorbed from the Li2CO3 sites of the LCO when the adsorption time was not long enough, i.e., 1 h. Since most of the residual Li2CO3 was washed off via water treatment (Fig. 1B), there was no benzene desorption at low temperature over the H2O-LCO (dashed blue curve). Besides, the oxygen sites of the H2O-LCO were probably more reactive than those of the LCO and the adsorbed benzene was oxidized with elevating temperature. Therefore, neither the benzene desorption at high temperature was detected over the H2O-LCO. The properties of oxygen species will be discussed in the next section. 3.3.2 Oxygen species The types and reactivity of the oxygen species over the LCO and H2O-LCO were disclosed with O2-TPD and H2-TPR measurements, with the results respectively displayed in Fig. 7 A and B. For the LCO, four oxygen peaks were evolved at 212, 333, 415 and 709 °C, respectively, and according to the literature [47], they are assigned to the desorption of chemically adsorbed oxygen, surficial lattice oxygen, lattice oxygen in bulk and oxygen species from deep decomposition of metal oxide, respectively. Two modifications took place over the H2O-LCO with respect to the LCO: (1) Only the strong desorption of bulk lattice oxygen was detected at 415 °C and the chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen were greatly reduced to nearly zero by water treatment, and (2) the evolution temperature of the oxygen species from deep decomposition of metal oxide shifted to a much lower temperature by 109 °C. Accordingly, the H2 consumption at 152, 256 and 490 °C over the LCO is supposed to originate from the successive reduction of the chemically adsorbed oxygen, surficial lattice oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen. And the reduction peaks at 717 and 837 °C, which were not seen over the H2O-LCO, are probably ascribed to the reduction of the oxygen species over the Li2CO3. For the H2O-LCO, the reduction temperature of the bulk lattice oxygen was decreased to 474 °C and a shoulder peak was newly formed at an even lower temperature of 421 °C, manifesting that water treatment significantly increased the reactivity of the bulk lattice oxygen. Herein, the results of the C6H6-TPD, O2-TPD and H2-TPR could be correlated as follows. Because of the blocking effect on the bulk lattice oxygen by the surface oxygen species, gaseous benzene was mainly adsorbed by the surface oxygen species, including chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen, over the LCO. The surface oxygen was not very reactive towards benzene oxidation and thus, most of the adsorbed benzene desorbed at high temperature. For the H2O-LCO, since there was no surface oxygen species covering the bulk lattice oxygen, the bulk lattice oxygen was much more easily accessed by gaseous benzene. Compared with the LCO, the reactivity of the bulk lattice oxygen of the H2O-LCO was markedly improved. Therefore, most of the adsorbed benzene over the H2O-LCO was oxidized by the lattice oxygen at high temperatures. 3.3.3 Proposed reaction mechanisms On the basis of the discussion above, the reaction mechanisms for catalytic air benzene oxidation over the LCO and H2O-LCO were proposed and illustrated in Fig. 8 , and the results in Fig. 4 could be explained accordingly. When gaseous benzene flowed through the LCO, a large amount of benzene came into contact with the surface oxygen sites with very little adsorption on the Li2CO3 site. However, the surface oxygen species, including chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen, were almost inert for the oxidation of adsorbed benzene. Therefore, high temperature was needed to make the bulk lattice oxygen transfer to contact and react with the adsorbed benzene. That is why only ∼20 % of benzene was removed at a high temperature as 400 °C. After the LCO was treated by water at 50 °C for 6 h, the surface oxygen was almost fully eliminated and the bulk lattice oxygen over the H2O-LCO was more exposed to gaseous benzene. What is more, the bulk lattice oxygen turned to be more reactive towards reducing reagent through water treatment. As a result, once the gaseous benzene was adsorbed and activated over the H2O-LCO, the adsorbed benzene could be efficiently oxidized by the bulk lattice oxygen. However, as inferred from the onset reduction temperature of the bulk lattice oxygen in Fig. 7B, the working temperatures for the bulk lattice oxygen during benzene oxidation should be in the range of 250−400 °C (as the S H sites). This is why the high-temperature activity (250−400 °C) of the H2O-LCO was much higher than that of the untreated sample and no deposition of any oxidation by-products was detected over the used H2O-LCO after benzene oxidation at 350 °C for 1 h (Fig. 9 ). The consumed lattice oxygen species would be replenished by the O2 in feed gas for the next reaction cycle according to the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism [48]. The activation of molecular O2 by these two samples was further evaluated via EPR (Fig. 7C) at room temperature. When the samples were exposed to air, an obvious signal with a g factor of ∼2.00 was observed for both the LCO and H2O-LCO, which can be ascribed to the surface superoxide radical anion O2·− species [49,50]. As for the H2O-LCO, this signal was much stronger than that of the LCO, confirming that O2 could be easily activated by the H2O-LCO. On the other hand, in terms of the benzene removal in the low-temperature range (150−200 °C), the H2O-LCO was superior over the LCO as well, which is attributed to the formation of another type of very active reaction sites (S L) via water treatment. These sites were very probably covered by Li2CO3 over the untreated sample and exposed after water treatment. Since the S L did not adsorb benzene according to the C6H6-TPD data (Fig. 6B), the S L-catalyzed reaction followed the Elay-Rideal (E–R) mechanism, in which the gas-phase benzene molecules could directly react with the oxygen species activated by the S L. Compared with the fresh H2O-LCO, the C O 3 2- peaks (dashed box in Fig. 9) grew much stronger over the used H2O-LCO after benzene oxidation at 200 °C for 1 h, indicating the accumulation of oxidation by-products at low reaction temperatures. Thus, the H2O-LCO gradually lost its activity in the low-temperature range (150−200 °C). Last but not least, as demonstrated from Fig. 4E and F, the pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O and NO2·xH2O deactivated the H2O-LCO to a large extent whereas the pre-adsorbed SO2·xH2O promoted benzene oxidation over the LCO. One can infer from these results that the chemically adsorbed oxygen and surface lattice oxygen might be more resistant to the SO2 and NO2 than the bulk lattice oxygen during benzene oxidation. This issue deserves further studies considering that the complicated air pollution might contain VOCs, SO2, NO2 and humidity at the same time, and the underlying mechanism will contribute to the successful preparation of active and anti-deactivation VOCs oxidation materials. 4 Conclusions Aiming at a simple and effective way to activate the recycled cathode materials from spent lithium-ion batteries for future environmental applications, in this study the reference LiCoO2 material was prepared by thermally treating the mixture of Li2CO3 and CoCO3, which was subsequently treated in water for structural modification. The obtained materials were used for catalytic benzene oxidation. XRD results show that the spinel structure of LiCoO2 was maintained after water treatment and SEM images indicate that water treatment could alleviate particle agglomeration. Water washing could not only leach off the Li2CO3 residues (ATR) but also eliminate the chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen (O2-TPD and H2-TPR). The bulk lattice oxygen was thereby exposed and more reachable to the gaseous benzene. According to the C6H6-TPD data, the Li2CO3 and surface oxygen species were inactive towards benzene oxidation and only acted as benzene adsorption sites while the bulk lattice oxygen could oxidize benzene efficiently at high temperatures. Under the reaction conditions of 120 L g−1 h−1 of space velocity, 416−431 ppm of benzene and 300 °C, ∼100 % of benzene conversion was achieved over the water-treated sample whereas only ∼6% of benzene could be removed by the untreated one. On the other hand, the benzene oxidation activity of the LiCoO2 at temperatures of 150−200 °C was also improved by water treatment. That is because the reactive sites generated by the wash-off of the excessive Li2CO3 could adsorb gaseous oxygen, which was activated to directly oxidize the gas-phase benzene into surface by-products at low temperatures (150−200 °C) following the Elay-Rideal pathway. The effectiveness of the water treatment process was also applicable to the commercialized LiCoO2 materials. We believe that this study should provide a new concept for reusing electronic wastes for air pollutant removal.
