Graphical abstract The oxygen evolution reaction performance was studied in the different oxygen coverage on the 110 surface of Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides by the first-principles. The OER activities on three O covered surfaces were compared with clean surface. The three different O covered surfaces included (i)1/4 monolayer O covered, (ii) 1/2 monolayer O covered, (iii) 3/4 monolayer O covered surface. The computed overpotential (η) on the four cases followed the order: 1/4 monolayer < clean < 1/2 monolayer < 3/4 monolayer. And the overpotential of the active site has the following order 1/4 monolayer Fe < 1/4 monolayer Ni. By calculating the partial density of states and Bader charge on the O covered surface, it was found that 1/4 monolayer O covered surface combined with the formation OH easily. Based on the above analysis, the 1/4 monolayer O covered Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides surface exhibited better OER catalytic performance than that of the clean surface in the OER cycle. Keywords Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides First-principles Oxygen evolution reaction Oxygen coverage Theory overpotential 1 Introduction For water splitting processes, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal reaction to many technologies for the conversion and storage of renewable energy metal-air batteries, and regenerative fuel cells [1,2]. However, this reaction is known kinetically sluggish and usually proceeds at high overpotential due to its unique reaction process, resulting in more energy loss and limiting the overall efficiency of the entire water splitting process. Therefore, to reduce energy loss, highly efficient electrocatalysts have been extensively studied. Among them, noble metal oxides such as RuO2 [3,4] and IrO2 [5] are well-known electrocatalysts, but these materials are not suitable for large-scale applications due to their rarity and high price. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that Ni-based catalysts showed the high OER catalytic activity among the 3d-transition metal systems in alkaline conditions [6–10]. Research by Yan's group shows that surface modification of the catalyst can further improve the performance of the catalyst [11]. Notably, electrode designed based on Ni-based catalyst, especially Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides (Ni3Fe-LDHs) with better OER performance, is still very challenging [12–16]. To design a catalyst with better catalytic performance, firstly the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction during water splitting needs to be studied. Moreover, studies have shown that Ni3Fe- LDHs materials have the better OER activity in alkaline media, the mechanism of OER on hydroxide need to be understood. At present, there have been numerous studies on the OER mechanism. The Nørskov [17] group studied the OER mechanism of oxide that the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst depends on the adsorption energy of the surface adsorption species *OH and *OOH under acidic medium. Simultaneously, the theoretical overpotential was calculated by ΔG*O, ΔG*OH, and ΔG*OOH. The method of calculating theoretical overpotential was followed by the transition metal alloy [18], the transition metal oxide and hydroxide [19]. The Be11 [20] group has studied different proportions of Fe doped into Ni(OH)2: The experimental results showed that the reaction activity was the highest when the content of Fe is 25 %. The density functional theory + U (DFT + U) calculation results indicated that when Fe was used as the OER reaction site, the overpotential was smaller. When the Ni3Fe-LDHs catalyst was exposed the (110) faces with more metal atoms, it was found that the OER process was energetically favored under common working conditions. As we all known, surface exposed metals are easily oxidized due to atoms being unsaturated. In Nørskov’s research mechanism [21], water molecules were decomposed to produce OH, which was also easy to adsorb on the exposed metal atoms. Nørskov et al. [22] used Pt and Au as catalysts to calculate the OER reactivity of two metal crystal faces(111) by the First-principles. The calculation demonstrated that for clean Pt and Au (111) crystal plane when O coverage is 1/3 ML. OER reaction activity is better than other cases. In 2013, the Kumar team [23] studied the water molecules adsorb on the surface of the nickel-iron spine on different surface structures using the First principles. Emily [24] and other researchers studied the OER activity of Fe2O3 surface (0001) covered by OH. The results of our previous research indicated that the OER electrochemical activity of Co in the case where the surface (110) of Co3O4 covered by O and OH was better than clean surface and the Co site had better performance under O covered conditions [25]. Besides, the adsorbed oxygen and hydroxyl were more stable intermediates, which was confirmed by Rossmeisl et al. [26]. In general, the different oxygen coverage on the catalyst surface play an key important role in the mechanism study of OER. Hence, this work aimed to investigate the oxygen evolving mechanism on the Ni3Fe-LDHs (110) surface and understand the OER performance on a clean surface and the O covered surfaces. Thereby, for the (110) crystal plane of Ni3Fe-LDHs, the OER activities was considered by the free energy changes on three different oxygen coverage surfaces including (i) 1/4 monolayer O covered, (ii) 1/2 monolayer O covered, (iii) 3/4 monolayer O covered surfaces. 2 Computational models and theoretical methods DFT calculations were performed with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [27,28]. For all the calculations, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) was used to describe the exchange and correlation energy density function [29,30]. The bulk lattice was optimized using the 5 × 5 ×5 Monkhorst-Pack type of K-point sampling and 3 × 3 × 1 for the period slab model was separated by 16 Å of vacuum [31]. The model of Ni3Fe-LDHs bulk in Fig. S1.The cutoff energy was chosen to be 400 eV in this study following our previous reports [32]. The maximum force and energy change of 0.01 eV/Å and 10−4 eV, respectively, were set as the convergence criteria [33]. We carried out Spin-polarized calculations including the dipole correlation, the atomic charge density coordinating to the adsorbed species through Bader charge analysis [34]. To improve the model accuracy, the DFT + U method was used to description correlation for 3d transition metal systems. The value of U was 5.3 for Fe and 6.45 for Ni. The U values were selected according to the literature [35–37]. To understand the surface reactivity of the four cases, the Gibbs free energy changes Eqs.(1–4) for the OER were calculated according to the simplified scheme developed by Nørskov et al. and energy differences ΔE i calculated relative to H2O and H2 (at U = 0 and pH = 0) as Eqs.(5–7). In the calculation, the OER was presumed to consist of four elementary reaction steps, Eqs.(a–d), in which each step involved the coupled transfer of an electron to the electrode and a proton to water as shown in the following equations [21]. a H 2 O(l)→ * OH+ H + + e - (1) Δ G 1 =E(*OH)+1/2E( H 2 )-E(*)-E( H 2 O) + Δ ZPE-T Δ S-eU+ k B TLn10•pH b * OH→ * O+H + +e - (2) Δ G 2 =E(*O)+1/2E( H 2 )-E(*OH)+ΔZPE-TΔS-eU+ k B TLn10•pH c H 2 O(l)+ * O → * OOH+H + +e - (3) Δ G 3 =E(*OOH)+1/2E( H 2 )-E( H 2 O)-E(*O) +ΔZPE-TΔS-eU+ k B TLn10•pH d * OOH→ * +O 2 +H + +e - (4) Δ G 4 =4.92-Δ G 1 -Δ G 2 -Δ G 3 (5) Δ E OH = E(*OH)-E(*)-[E ( H 2 O)-1/2E ( H 2 )] (6) Δ E O = E(*O)-E(*)-[E( H 2 O)-E( H 2 )] (7) Δ E O OH = E(*OOH)-E(*)-[2E( H 2 O)-3/2E( H 2 ) ] We marked the intermediate species adsorbed on the active sites with “*OH”, “*O” and “*OOH”. Notely, the E (*), E(*OH), E(*O), and E(*OOH) represented the total energy of the coordinate species adsorbed in the active sites which calculated by the First-principles. The energy of H + + e – was obtained by referencing the energy of H2 using the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, 1/2H 2 → H + + e −, at pH = 0, p =1 atm, T =298 K). Zero Point Energy (ZPE) and entropy (TS) change for gas molecules (H2, O2, H2O) could be found in Table 1 and the results of ΔZPE-TΔS (eV) for corresponding steps in Table2 , based on our calculation and confirmed by previous reports. -eU represented the free energy changes for one electron transfer where U is electrode potential respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Considering pH effects on free energy, it can be defined as -kBTLn10 pH (pH ≠ 0), where kB is Boltzmann constant [25]. ΔG4 was calculated by 4.92-ΔG1-ΔG2-ΔG3. The free energy of O2 was obtained through the reaction O2 + 4(H + + e−) →2H2O [16,36]. There are many researches on the reaction mechanism of OER [38]. Here a 4e- mechanism was used in our calculation and the equilibrium potential is 1.23 V, the full energy is 4 × 1.23 = 4.92 eV. This analysis is based on the scheme developed by Nørskov’s group. The theory overpotential of OER in this mechanism was defined as ηOER = max (ΔG1,2,3,4 /e) -1.23 V. 3 Results and discussion To investigate the impact the different oxygen coverage of Ni3Fe-LDHs surface on the OER performance, DFT + U calculations were firstly carried out to study the OER thermodynamics of Ni3Fe-LDHs. Different surface cases were taken into our consideration, namely, (i) clean surface, (ii) 1/4 monolayer O covered surface, (iii) 1/2 monolayer O covered surface, and (iv) 3/4 monolayer O covered surface. The optimized crystal cell parameters were shown in Table S1. The structures of the optimized species on the four different cases were shown in Fig. 1 a–i. The four-electron mechanism diagram of different sites on O covered surfaces was displayed in Fig. 2 . Firstly, the reaction occurred with an adsorbed H2O molecule on the surface, removing a proton to an adsorbed OH. Next, the adsorbed OH releases a proton, leaving the adsorbed atomic O, followed by the reaction to H2O with the adsorbed atomic O to produce the adsorbed OOH. The fourth step involved the reaction of the adsorbed OOH to form the molecular O2 and the initial surface. In the images of Fig. 2a and b, It is shown that the calculation process of a 4e− mechanism in Ni and Fe active site under the 1/4 ML O covered surface. The Fig. 2c and d displayed the optimized structure for all intermediates adsorbed 1/2 ML O covered surface of Fe and Ni site, respectively. The OER mechanism on 3/4 ML O covered surface was illustrated in the picture of Fig. 2e for Ni active site and Fig. 2f for Fe active site. In this work, the free energy changes in Eqs. (1–4) depended on the adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH and were determined based on the DFT + U calculations in Table3 . Gibbs free energy of other metal sites with different oxygen coverage was shown in Table S2. Under the condition of 1/4 ML oxygen coverage, the calculation results showed that the Fe1 site and the Ni1 site have the same rate-determining step, the OH dehydrogenation becomes O was the rate-determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction, and the overpotential 0.424 eV on Fe site was smaller than the overpotential 0.829 eV on Ni site. The free energy diagram of other different oxygen coverage was shown in Fig. 3 . Free energy plot on Ni site was demonstrated in Fig. 3a under the 1/4 ML O covered surface. The step diagram of 1/2 ML O covered surface and 3/4 ML O covered surface were showed in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. It found that the Ni site had the following tendency on overpotential: 1/4 ML ( = 0.829 eV) < 1/2 ML (η = 0.917 eV) < clean (η = 0.918 eV) < 3/4 ML (η = 0.999 eV), and the rate determining step did not change. The Fig. 3d and e displayed the free energy plots on Fe site of 1/4 ML O covered surface and 1/2 ML O covered surface. For 3/4 ML O coverage, the free energy was plot in Fig. 3f By analyzing the free energy, it revealed that the overpotential of the Fe site had the following relationship with the oxygen coverage: 1/4 ML (η = 0.424 eV)< clean (η = 0.571 eV)< 1/2 ML ( = 0.606 eV)< 3/4 ML (η = 0.770 eV), and the potential determining step of the OER reaction was changed from OH dehydrogenation to OH adsorption, indicating that different oxygen coverage had a greater influence on the OER performance of the Fe site. When the oxygen coverage was 1/4 ML, the Ni and Fe active sites showed the smallest overpotential in Fig. 4 a. This conclusion is consistent with existing reports that the catalyst has the best activity when the catalyst surface is covered with 1/4 ML of oxygen [39]. From the curve of -η vs ΔE*OH was shown in Fig. 4b, founding that the OER activity of 1/4 ML coverage of Fe site was better, and the adsorption energy of OH is the best position. The Fe site at the clean surface had smaller adsorption energy for OH, while the 1/2 ML and 3/4 ML oxygen coverage had larger adsorption energy, which is disadvantageous for the subsequent reaction. The binding energy of intermediates was calculated for different metal sites on the (110) surface of Ni3Fe-LDHs in Table 4 . The binding energy of *O versus *OH had the relationship of ΔE*OH = 0.66 ΔE*O -0.97 eV in Fig. 4c, which agreed with the before the study [4]. At the same time, the result also obtained a linear relationship of ΔE*OOH = ΔE*OH + 3.10 eV (±0.2 eV) between the binding energy of *OOH versus *OH in Fig. 4d. This curve is similar to the previous study [40]. From the free energy diagram analysis, it indicated that the rate-determining step of the OER process change with the increase of oxygen coverage. Those showed that different oxygen coverage have a great influence on the OER performance of the metal sites. Especially, the adsorption of OH played a key important role in the first step of OER reaction. Comparing with 1/4 O coverage, the clean surface has weaker adsorption of OH, however, when the oxygen coverage is 1/2 and 3/4, the adsorption energy of OH becomes too strong. To get further insight into the different oxygen coverage on surface metal atoms and changes in metal oxidation states, a partial density of states (PDOS) was taken into consideration. In the PDOS for Ni site (Fig. 5 a) and Fe site (Fig. 5b), the occupied states under the Fermi level were bonded by Fe 3d and Ni 3d. In Fig. 5a, for 1/4 ML oxygen coverage, the state density of the Ni was similar to that before uncovered, indicating that oxygen coating had little effect on Ni site. However, for Fe element in Fig. 5b, there was no change in the valence band maximum (VBM), the conduction band maximum (CBM) shifted to high energy with a value of 0.2 eV. The movement of 0.2 eV indicated that Fe3+ was more easily combined with the intermediate species OH, and the adsorption energy of OH was reduced, which was beneficial to the first step of OER processes. When the oxygen coverage was 1/2 ML, the state of Fe 3d was changed, spanning the Fermi level. Simultaneously the valence band maximum (VBM) of Ni element shifted 0.24 eV to high energy, and its conduction band shifted to high energy by 0.28 eV. The highest valence state moved to the Fermi level. When the band is low and broad, only a single resonance can be seen at the bottom of the band, but d shifts up a distinctive antibonding state appear above the band. Since these antibonding states were above the Fermi level, they were empty, and the bond becomes increasingly stronger as the number of empty antibonding states increases [41]. Therefore compared with 1/4 ML coverage, the adsorption energy of OH of 1/2 ML coverage was increasing. Similarly, when the 3/4 ML oxygen coverage, the number of the empty antibonding states was grow. As the oxygen coverage increases, the adsorption energy of OH increased gradually. Therefore, the adsorption energy of OH of 3/4 ML was the largest in the models. Combining with the above E*OH-η volcano pattern, the energy of the first step for the Ni site was gradually increased during the process of OER, but the rate-determining step was still the OH dehydrogenation reaction. For the Fe site, however, with the oxygen coverage increases, the first step became the rate-limiting step. This result fully demonstrated that oxygen coverage has a vital influence on the OER performance of metal active sites. To further understand effect of oxygen coverage, the Bader charge in Fig. 6 a was calculated, the results proved that under 1/4 ML O covered surface, the Bader charge of Fe was 1.4737, which was the largest than other O covered surface. On the condition of 1/2 ML and 3/4 ML O covered surface, the Bader charge was smaller, which is attributed to that the p orbital electrons of the covered oxygen might donate electrons to Fe site. As the number of oxygen atoms covered increases, the Lewis acidity of the metal sites decreased and the free energy (ΔG1) of the first step became larger, which the OER activity decreases. Nickel sites had the same trend as iron sites. From the analysis of the adsorption energy and oxygen coverage of OH in Fig. 6b, it can be seen that the OH adsorption energy of Fe element gradually increases, and the OH adsorption energy of nickel site also gradually increases, which reduced metal site activity. This is consistent with Bader charges. Summarizing the above analysis, the OER performance of 1/4 ML oxygen coverage was better than other cases. The calculation indicated that the Fe site had better activity than the Ni site, and the Fe site had a greater contribution in the process of OER and maybe the main active site, which is consistent with previous research conclusions [20]. 4 Conclusions In summary, the First-principles was performed to characterize the thermodynamics of OER in the different oxygen coverage on the 110 surface of the Ni3Fe-LDHs. The changes of the Gibbs free energy for the elementary steps, partial density of states (PDOS) and Bader charge for every species was calculated and analyzed in the OER processes on four surfaces including (i) clean surface, (ii) 1/4 monolayer O covered surface, (iii) 1/2 monolayer O covered surface, (iv) 3/4 monolayer O covered surface. Theoretical analysis suggested that for 1/4 monolayer O covered surface, the overpotential on Fe site for 0.424 eV is better than on Ni site for 0.829 eV. The computed overpotential (η) for the four cases followed the order: 1/4 ML < clean < 1/2 ML < 3/4 ML and the overpotential of the active site has the following order 1/4 ML Fe <1/4 ML Ni. Specifically, the optimal binding of O, OH, and OOH reactive species is the key to reduce the reaction potential. The 1/4 monolayer O covered Ni3Fe-LDHs surface is predicted to have higher catalytic activity than clean surface, indicating that the potential at which such material would split water is slightly lower than the potential needed on a clean surface.

        "dc:description": "The oxygen evolution reaction performance was studied in the different oxygen coverage on the 110 surface of Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides by the first-principles. The OER activities on three O covered surfaces were compared with clean surface. The three different O covered surfaces included (i)1/4 monolayer O covered, (ii) 1/2 monolayer O covered, (iii) 3/4 monolayer O covered surface. The computed overpotential (η) on the four cases followed the order: 1/4 monolayer < clean < 1/2 monolayer < 3/4 monolayer. And the overpotential of the active site has the following order 1/4 monolayer Fe < 1/4 monolayer Ni. By calculating the partial density of states and Bader charge on the O covered surface, it was found that 1/4 monolayer O covered surface combined with the formation OH easily. Based on the above analysis, the 1/4 monolayer O covered Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides surface exhibited better OER catalytic performance than that of the clean surface in the OER cycle.",
