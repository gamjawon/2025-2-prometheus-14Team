Recently, these catalysts have also been used for upgrading synthetic crudes such as coal-derived liquids. However, less efficient catalytic activity and shorter lifetime were obtained when using catalysts that were developed for petroleum refining [4] . This is mainly due to the difference in properties of the starting feed materials. Coal-derived liquids contain large amounts of nitrogen-containing compounds and aromatics as compared to petroleum. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop catalysts that are effective for upgrading coal-derived liquids. A new type of catalyst that promotes hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of the nitrogen-containing compounds and hydrogenation (HY) of the aromatic rings is now required for practical upgrading of coal-derived liquids [ 5 ] . During the course of developing better catalysts, a highly active Ni-W catalyst was designed and developed [6] . This catalyst showed much higher HDN and HY activities for upgrading coal-derived liquids as compared to commercial catalysts. In this work 500 and 1000 h of catalyst performance tests were carried out over the newly developed catalyst using coal-derived kerosene and gas oil, respectively. Catalyst deactivation during the upgrading reaction was then studied to understand the process of catalyst deactivation. Precise characterization of used catalysts by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS and XANES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done for this study. A good understanding of the deactivation profile will facilitate the development of a new generation of catalysts having superior activity and longer life. 2. Experimental Three series of transition metal sulfide catalysts (Ni-Mo, Co-Mo and Ni-W) were prepared using an impregnation method. Of the transition metal sulfide catalysts prepared, Ni-W catalysts were selected for upgrading coal-derived liquids, because the Ni-W/A1203 catalysts showed much higher HDN and HY activities as compared to the other catalysts (Ni--Mo and Co-Mo series). Physical and chemical properties of the A1203 support such as pore size distribution and acidity were controlled to enhance the catalytic performance (activity and long life) and to give a longer life by changing the preparation conditions [ 7 ] . Then each metal loading of the Ni-W catalyst was optimized to give the highest HDN and HY activities. Finally a 4.2 wt.-% Ni0-29.0 wt.-% W03AI203 catalyst (extrudate 0.8 mm diameter, surface area of 177 m2 /g, and pore volume of 0.42 cm3 / g) was developed for upgrading coal-derived liquids [ 5 ] . This catalyst was used in 500 and 1000 h of catalyst performance tests. A commercial catalyst (Ni-Mo/A1203) that had shown the highest catalytic performance for upgrading coal-derived liquids was selected from the commercially available catalysts as a reference catalyst for ker- T Kameoka et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 217-228 Table 1 Properties of the coal-derived distillates 219 Kerosene fraction Gas oil fraction C (wt.-%) 87.4 86.6 H (wt.-%) 10.3 9.3 S (wt.-%) 0.01 0.05 N (wt.-%) 0.57 0.51 Q (wt.-% ) 1.7 3.5 BRD (by DGC)\" IBP ()b 155 214 50 vol.-% () 216 290 90 vol.-% () 228 352 Boiling range distribution measured using a distillation gas chromatograph. n Initial boiling point. osene fraction upgrading. Before reaction, the catalysts were presulfided to produce the active sulfide form using a flow of H2S/HZ gas (5 vol.-%, 200 ml/min) at 400 for 10 h. The test feedstocks used were a kerosene fraction obtained from Wandoan coal and a gas oil fraction obtained from Battleriver coal (Table 1) . These distillates were upgraded using a continuous flow reactor (Fig. 1) . The reaction conditions selected for upgrading coal-derived kerosene were as follows; LHSV, 2.0 h- t; H, pressure, 13.2 MPa; reaction temperature, 370; and HZ/oil, 1000 Nm3/kl. For the upgrading reaction of coal-derived gas oil different reaction conditions were used (LHSV, 1.0 h-'; HZ pressure, 11.8 MPa; reaction temperature, 380; HZ/ oil, 1000 Nm3/kl). Model test reactions were also done using batch type reactors with a capacity of 50 cm3 to elucidate the deactivation behavior of each catalyst function such as hydrogenation (HY) or hydrocracking (HC) .

The reaction conditions were as follows; model compound, 10 ml; initial HZ pressure, 6.9 MPa; reaction temperature, 400; reaction time, 1 h. Gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID) and flame thermionic detection (FTD), and mass spectroscopy (MS) were used for the analysis of the feedstocks and products. The HDN activities of the catalysts were evaluated using a total nitrogen analyzer. Aromaticity was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Before and after catalyst performance tests, catalysts were characterized using XPS, XAFS (EXAFS and XANES), and TEM. XAFS measurement were carried out to evaluate changes in the local structures of the active atoms of the catalysts using beam lines lOB and 7C at the Photon Factory in the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst performance tests The results of a short-term catalyst performance test for upgrading the kerosene fraction are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The newly developed catalyst showed much higher HDN and HY activities than the reference catalyst during the 500 h upgrading reaction. Deactivation of the HDN activity was observed on the reference catalyst after 300 h of reaction, while no deactivation was observed on the Ni-W catalyst. A similar trend was obtained for the deactivation of the HY activity as shown in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows the properties of the products obtained after the 300 h upgrading of the kerosene fraction.

The newly developed catalyst was found to maintain high HDN and HY activities during the performance test, though slight initial deactivation was observed. The characteristics of the catalysts before and after the upgrading reaction of kerosene are shown in Table 3. The surface area and pore volume of the Ni-W catalyst decreased to some extent after the reaction. A similar trend was observed for the reference catalyst. The amount of carbonaceous deposits on the Ni-W catalyst after hexane extraction was 6.4 wt.-%, in keeping with that on the reference catalyst. A sift of pore size to lower diameters was not observed on used catalysts, while the pore volume decreased to some extent after reaction, as shown in Fig. 5.

Kameoka et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 217-228 223 These results indicate that the Ni-W catalyst developed is superior to the commercially available catalysts and that it has practical application in the upgrading of coal-derived liquids. 3.2. Characterization of used catalysts A complete understanding of catalyst deactivation behavior is invaluable for improving or developing a new catalyst with superior catalyst functions and long life. In particular, basic knowledge about changes in active sites of the Ni-W catalyst, such as the sulfide states or the local structure of the tungsten atoms, will lead to the improvement of the Ni-W catalyst. Accordingly, precise characterization of fresh and used catalysts was carried out. TEM was used to measure the shape and size of the WS2-like structures on the catalysts. XPS and EXAFS were used to clarify the changes in the sulfide state and local structure of tungsten sulfide on the catalysts during 1000 h of coal-derived gas oil upgrading. TEM analysis revealed considerable growth of WS2-like structures after the upgrading reaction (Fig. 6a and b). The average size of the WS2-like structures observed on the used Ni-W catalyst are larger than those of the MOS2-like structures observed on the used Ni-Mo catalyst (4.2 wt.-% Ni0--18 at. -% Mo03/A1203) that was also used for coal-derived gas oil upgrading under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 6b and Fig. 7b) .Small crystal sizes for WS2 or MOS2 structures were observed on both freshly sulfided catalysts (Fig. 6a and Fig. 7a). This means that the crystal growth of WS2-like structures on Ni-W catalysts is more rapid than that of the MOS2-like structures. This is mainly due to less interaction between tungsten and aluminum or tungsten and nickel as compared to that between molybdenum and aluminum or molybdenum and nickel. Measurements of Ni 2p photoelectron spectra showed that the surface concentration of nickel on the Ni-W catalyst decreased after 1000 h of upgrading, indicating phase segregation of nickel from tungsten (Fig. 8a) . On the other hand, measurements of W 4f photoelectron spectra indicated that sulfurization of tungsten proceeded during the upgrading reaction (Fig. 8b) . EXAFS and XANES measurements supported the above discussion and gave direct information on the active sites of the Ni-W catalyst such as W-S (Table 4) [ 5,81. The number of coordinated sulfur atoms around each tungsten atom increased after the upgrading reaction, showing the progress of the sulfurization of tungsten. The number of nearest tungsten atoms around each tungsten atom also increased after the upgrading reaction, indicating agglomeration of WS2-like structures during reaction. The results of these precise characterizations indicate that there more possibilities still remain for improving the catalyst performance of the newly developed catalyst, though catalyst deactivation was not observed in the short tests described here. 224 T.

Changes in the crystal size of the WSZ-like structures and the sulfide states, as well as in the local structure of the catalysts, affect the catalyst functions of the NiW catalysts. The crystal growth of WSZ-like structures results in a decrease in the number of effective active sites on the catalyst.

Based upon the above considerations, model test reactions were done to elucidate the changes in the catalytic functions of the Ni-W catalyst.

Diphenylmethane was used as a model compound to evaluate the HY and HC activities of the Ni-W catalyst. After 43 h of reaction, the yields of benzene and toluene decreased to a considerable extent as compared to that obtained over the fresh catalyst. This indicates that the HC activity of the Ni-W catalyst decreased. This is probably due to the deposit of carbonaceous material on the catalyst. The yield of benzylcyclohexane, however, did not change, showing that the HY activity of the Ni-W catalyst is still relatively high after 43 h of reaction. On the other hand, both HC and HY activities decreased to a large extend after the Ni-W catalyst was used for 1000 h of reaction. This deactivation is probably due to the changes in the catalyst properties such as the crystal growth or the local structure. The results obtained from the precise characterization of the catalysts and the model test reactions suggest that the HDN and HY activities of the Ni-W catalyst decrease when long term catalyst performance tests are carried out or when severe reaction conditions are used.

Summary and conclusions The newly developed Ni-W catalyst showed a much higher HDN activity than a reference catalyst or other Ni-Mo catalysts in the upgrading process of the coalderived kerosene and gas oil. The amount of aromatic compounds was decreased to a considerable extent after hydrotreating the feeds over the Ni-W catalyst. The deactivation of the Ni-W catalyst was not observed during the 1000 h upgrading reaction. Precise characterization of the Ni-W catalyst used in the upgrading, however, revealed that crystal growth of WSZ-like structures and changes in the sulfide states and local structure of tungsten on the catalyst occurred during the upgrading reaction. These changes indicate that there are changes in the functions of the Ni-W catalyst. The model test reactions confirmed these changes by showing that the HY and HC activities of the catalyst decreased after 1000 h of reaction. These findings gave new insight into how to improve the catalytic activity and life of the newly developed catalyst.

        "dc:description": "A NiW catalyst designed and developed for upgrading coal-derived liquids was used in 500 and 1000 h catalyst performance tests using coal-derived kerosene and gas oil, respectively. The catalyst showed considerable improvement in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrogenation (HY) activities and less initial deactivation as compared to commercial catalysts. The catalysts used for the catalyst performance tests were characterized to clarify catalyst deactivation behavior. Precise characterization of the used catalysts by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS and XANES), and transmission electron microscopy revealed that crystal growth of WS2-like structures and changes in the sulfided states and in the local structure of tungsten on the catalysts occurred during the upgrading reaction. These findings gave new insights for improving catalytic activity and the life of the newly developed catalyst.",
