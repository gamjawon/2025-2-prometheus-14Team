These catalysts are highly active and stereoselective for Heck vinylation reaction of aryl iodide with olefines at 130–150°C, and can be reused after washing without loss in activity. An induction period of more than 2h was observed. Keywords Heck reaction Poly-γ-aminopropylsilane Transition metal complex Induction period 1 Introduction The vinylation of aryl halides (Heck reaction), one of the most important CC bond formation reactions in organic synthesis is mostly catalyzed by palladium complex in homogenous solution [1–4]. Recently, several publications have appeared on the development of heterogeneous catalysts [5,6], such as supported palladium on carbon [7], metal oxides [8] and zeolites [9], and silica-supported palladium complexes [10], in order to perform Heck vinylation reaction in a simple and inexpensive way. Comparison with supported palladium catalysts, supported transition metal (Cu, Co, Ni) catalysts are much less expensive for Heck reaction, but catalytic activity decreased rapidly [11] when it was reused. We report here the application of silica-supported poly-γ-aminopropylsilane transition metal (Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+) complexes for a CC bond formation, viz. the Heck reaction. These catalysts give trans-products in high yields at 130–150°C and can be reused after washing without loss in activity. In addition, an induction period of more than 2h is found in the Heck reactions. 2 Experimental The supported transition metal complex catalysts (abbreviated as “Si”∼NH2·M(OAc)2, M=Ni2+, Cu2+ and Co2+) could be easily prepared by the reaction of poly-γ-aminopropylsilane with fumed silica, followed by treatment with metal acetate in ethanol (Scheme 1 ). The Ni, Cu and Co contents were 3.9, 3.6 and 3.7wt.%, respectively, and nitrogen content was 3.6wt.% in “Si”∼NH2·M(OAc)2 catalysts. In the presence of these catalysts, the vinylation reactions of substituted aryl iodides with a varieties of olefins were carried out at 130–150°C, and gave the corresponding trans-product in high yields. The trans-selectivity was always near quantitative, and no cis-product was observed (Scheme 2 ). A typical reaction, a mixture of tri-n-butylamine (11mmol), acrylic acid (10mmol), iodobezene (5mmol), 3ml NMP and 0.05g “Si”∼NH2·Ni(OAc)2 (0.034mmol) was stirred under N2 in an oil bath at 130°C. The reaction progress was monitored by TCL. After the reaction, the catalyst “Si”∼NH2·Ni(OAc)2 was separated from the mixture by filtration. A dilute HCl (2% solution) was poured into the filtrate, and then the white precipitate was filtered, washed by water and recrystallized to get trans-cinnamic acid. 3 Results and discussion All catalysts were treated with KBH4/C2H5OH before they were used. This results in the vinylation reactions of substituted aryl iodides with a varieties of olefins were summarized in Table 1 . From Table 1, it could be seen that the vinylation reaction using supported Ni complex as catalysts gave the substituted products in high yields (88–98%) at 130–150°C. Using supported Co and Cu complexes, also gave good yields (71–95%) of the substituted products except the reaction of iodobenzene with styrene, in which stilbene was obtained in about 40% yields. The function groups on benzene ring have influence on the activity of aryl iodides markedly. Longer reaction time was required in the reaction of 4-iodobenzoic acid with alkenes, and no reaction was observed with 4-iodonitrobenzene catalyzed by these catalysts. The activities of the supported transition metal (Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+) complexes without treatment with KBH4 were tested for the vinylation of iodobenzene with acrylic acid and their recycling studies were also carried out. The results were listed in Table 2 . From Table 2, it was found that these catalysts gave high yields in the first run, but all reaction had longer reaction time and were performed in 6–11h. In the recycling experiments, two recycling were carried out with all the catalysts. It was interesting that the yields of trans-product increased about 1–4% in the second run while all reaction were performed only in 2–4h. The similar results had also been reported in recycling test for supported Pd catalysts [12]. The much shorter reaction time in the second run indicated that there was an induction period in the first run. In order to test the induction period, the reaction progress was monitored by GC in the first run (as shown in Fig. 1 ). It was found that an induction period of more than 2h was observed for these catalysts. In the induction period studies of the supported Pd catalysts [13,14], the authors thought that the induction period corresponded to the delay required for the reduction of precursor Pd2+ species to the active Pd(0) and the reduction was probably caused by both styrene and OH groups in zeolite cages. Comparison of the results with Table 1 (entry 1) and Table 2 revealed that the supported M2+ complexes treated with KBH4/C2H5OH exhibit similar catalytic properties to the catalysts used in second run. The XPS data of these catalysts (after the first run reaction) also revealed the presence of the metals of 0 and +1 oxidation state. The probable mechanism of the reaction should be similar to homogenous catalyst for the Heck reaction. Hence, we believed that the induction period observed in our experiments might be caused by the reduction of supported M2+ species to the active M (0,1) (M=Ni, Cu and Co). In conclusion, we have synthesized new catalysts for the vinylation Heck reaction—silica-supported transition metal Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+ complexes. These complexes exhibit a high activity and stereoselectivity at a lower reaction temperature of 130–150°C, and can be reused after washing without loss in activity. It is interesting that an induction period of more than 2h has been observed in the first run reactions for these catalysts.
