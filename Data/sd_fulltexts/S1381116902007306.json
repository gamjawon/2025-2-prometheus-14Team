Fax: +886-2-23636359. MCM-41 supported MoO3/ZrO2 was an excellent catalyst for liquid phase condensation of 2-methylfuran with acetone to form 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl)propane. Molybdenum and zirconium mixed oxides were supported on siliceous MCM-41 mesoporous material. The resultant materials were characterized with various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), XANES, NH3-TPD, and Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of pyridine. It was found that the well-ordered channeling pores of MCM-41 were retained with a maximum loading of 9wt.% MoO3 and 13wt.% ZrO2. The ZrMo2O8 crystallites appeared with an even higher loading. The materials had surface areas greater than 500m2/g and a relatively narrow pore size distribution. MoO3 and ZrO2 were well dispersed inside the pores of MCM-41. The Mo(VI) was found in octahedral coordination when no ZrMo2O8 crystallites were detected. The MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples contained only Lewis acid sites. Although NH3-TPD experiments indicated that its acid strength was weaker than that of Y-zeolite, the MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 materials were excellent catalysts for liquid phase condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone to form 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl)propane (BMP). Keywords Molybdena Zirconia Mixed oxide Catalyst Acid MCM-41 2-Methylfuran Acetone Liquid phase condensation 1 Introduction Due to the hazardous properties of liquid acids such as HF and H2SO4 commonly employed in the current petrochemical industry, a great effort has been focused on the development of more environmental friendly strong solid acids [1]. Sulfated metal oxides, especially sulfated zirconia, have attracted great attention in this decade because they demonstrate high catalytic activities in skeletal isomerization of alkanes at relatively low temperatures [2–4]. However, the gradual loss of sulfur during the reaction processes is its drawback. Subsequent to the discovery of strong acidity on the sulfated zirconia, Hino and Arata found that zirconia loaded with tungsten oxide [5] or molybdenum oxide [6] also showed high catalytic activities for the skeletal isomerization of alkanes and benzoylation of toluene, both of which need strong acidic catalysts. These materials, if prepared properly, could achieve surface areas of around 100–200m2/g. However, the non-uniform pore size and relatively small surface area may limit their applications in catalytic reactions involving bulky molecules, such as those encountered in synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. MCM-41 is the most well studied member of the M41S meso-structured silica family discovered by the researchers at Mobil [7]. It has a uniformed hexagonal array of mesopores and very high surface area (typically around 1000m2/g). This material has been shown to be an excellent support for preparing supported catalysts with superior activities and selectivities, compared to those supported on amorphous silica, alumina, or zeolites in reactions such as hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil [8], hydrogenation of aromatics [9], and liquid phase metathesis [10]. That is because the mesoporous materials facilitate the diffusion of bulky organic molecules in and out of the porous structures [11]. However, the siliceous mesoporous material itself has no acidity and low catalytic activities. Over the past 3 years, strong acid sites were introduced onto the mesoporous materials by supporting sulfated zirconia on MCM-41 [12–16]. The resultant material was found to be a strong acid catalyst and very active in n-butane isomerization [12,13,15,16], MTBE synthesis and n-pentane isomerization [14]. Although zirconia loaded with tungsten oxide [5] or molybdenum oxide [6] were also reported to be strong acid catalysts, up to now, no reports concerning mesoporous materials supported on these mixed oxides were found. The aim of this study is to introduce acid function onto the mesoporous MCM-41 material by supporting Mo/Zr mixed oxide on it and to examine the catalytic activities of the resultant materials. The catalytic reaction under investigation is the liquid phase condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone to form 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl)propane (BMP). Furan is a well-known representative of a series of five-member unsaturated ‘heteroaromatic’ compounds. In this family, bisfurylalkanes are the relevant intermediates for macromolecular chemistry [17]. The derived materials have a useful range of applications, mostly for foundry cores and molds, corrosion-resistant materials, and precursors to graphitic composites and adhesives [18]. It is produced by the condensation of 2-methylfuran with acetone catalyzed by a strong acid, either Brönsted or Lewis acids [19,20]. Because the furan rings are highly reactive towards electrophilic aromatic substitution [21], large amounts of oligomeric products are generally formed during the reactions of furan heterocycles over zeolite catalysts such as H-β and H-US-Y [20]. Moreover, the strong adsorption of BMP or other reaction intermediates in the zeolite pores usually leads to extensive polymerization. As a result, the zeolite pores are blocked and the catalyst deactivates readily. Therefore, it is necessary to search for other strong acidic materials with relatively large pores catalyzing this reaction. Van Rhijn et al. [22] used sulfonic acid functionalized MCM-41 materials as catalysts for this reaction. The highest BMP yield of 82% was obtained. These results will be compared with those over Mo/Zr mixed oxide supported on MCM-41. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Pure siliceous MCM-41 was synthesized according to the method reported by Das et al. [23]. The molar ratio of the synthesis gel composition is SiO2:0.48CTMA+:0.33TPA+:0.39Na2O:0.29H2SO4:110H2O. A sample of Al-MCM-41 was also prepared by using sodium aluminate (Nakarai) as the Al source and the Si/Al molar ratio in the synthesis gel was 33. The MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples were prepared by depositing zirconium hydroxide on MCM-41, followed by impregnation to introduce molybdena. As-synthesized MCM-41 powders were dispersed in an aqueous solution of zirconyl chloride octahydrate (Riedel-deHaën, 99.5%) under vigorous stirring. Then aqueous ammonia was added until the pH reached ca. 10 to precipitate zirconium hydroxide. The obtained solids were washed until the filtrate was free of Cl− ions. After drying in air overnight at 100°C, the solid was impregnated with desired amount of aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (Riedel-deHaën, 99%). The dried samples were calcined in air at 560°C for 6h (heating rate at 1°C/min) to remove the organic surfactant. The resultant samples were further calcined at higher temperatures for 3h to examine the effect of calcination temperature. The same preparation procedure was used for preparing the MoO3/ZrO2/SiO2 sample, where SiO2 is a silica gel purchased from Acros. MoO3/ZrO2 without support was also prepared by impregnation of zirconium hydroxide, which was obtained by precipitation of zirconyl chloride octahydrate with aqueous ammonia, with ammonium heptamolybdate. After impregnation and drying, the sample was calcined at 750°C for 3h in air. Another sample MoO3/ZrO2+MCM-41 was prepared by physically mixing the MoO3/ZrO2 sample with calcined MCM-41. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Scintag X1 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Hitachi H-7100 instrument operated at 100keV. The elemental contents in bulk were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Jarrell-Ash, ICAP9000) on the HF and H2O2 dissolved samples. The X-ray adsorption spectra were taken with synchrotron radiation at the Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The storage ring was operated at 1.5GeV with about 120–200mA ring current. Data were collected using total electron yield and fluorescence detection. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 instrument. 50mg of dried sample was pre-treated at 500°C under ultra-high pure helium (50ml/min) for 1h and then cooled to 120°C. After introducing anhydrous NH3 at 120°C for 0.5h, the sample was flushed with helium for 1h. TPD profile of ammonia was obtained from 120 to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The desorption process was monitored by a quadruple mass spectrometer (Thermo ONIX, ProLab) connected on line through a heated capillary interface. The mass number of 16 was followed to obtain TPD profiles of NH3 because the mass intensity is relatively strong and the interference from H2O is negligible. A HY-zeolite sample (Si/Al=2.7) provided from Asia reference catalyst (no. 25) and another of Si/Al=24 from Advchem Laboratories Inc. were used as references. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of the samples adsorbing pyridine were recorded using a BOMEM MB155 FT-IR/Raman spectrometer. The equipment was furnished with an in situ sample cell (Harrick). The sample was pre-heated at 300°C for 3h under 10−6 mbar vacuum before pyridine vapor was introduced at room temperature, followed by evacuation for 30min. Spectra were acquired from room temperature to 500°C under vacuum. 2.3 Catalytic study Catalytic activities of the samples were tested in the acid-catalyzed condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone. In a typical case, 1.8g MF and 3.2g acetone were mixed in a three-necked glass flask with reflux set-up. After 0.18g solid catalyst was added, the reaction mixture was heated at 50°C with stirring for 24h. Then the solid was separated by filtration. The liquid to which was added known amount of toluene as an internal standard, was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with an Rtx-5 column and an FID detector. The BMP selectivity was calculated based on the conversion of MF instead of acetone. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts As-synthesized MCM-41 was used as the precursor for the preparation of supported catalysts. In contrast to the calcined samples, the as-synthesized MCM-41 with the surfactant templates still in the pores can tolerate the media encountered in the catalyst preparation procedure. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the MCM-41 samples before and after the introduction of zirconia and molybdena. All the samples preserve the ordered hexagonal structure of MCM-41, although the intensity of the diffraction peaks of MCM-41 decreases slightly after precipitation of zirconium hydroxide and impregnation with MoO3. The relatively lower diffraction peak intensity is attributed to the decrease in diffraction contrast of the lattice when the pores are filled with either the organic template or the oxides. In addition, the unit cells shrank slightly after the samples were calcined. The XRD patterns of 10% MoO3/7% ZrO2/MCM-41 samples calcined at different temperatures were also compared (not shown). Although a slight decrease in the diffraction peak intensity can be seen with the increase of calcination temperature, all the samples retain the ordered structure of MCM-41 after calcination at 560–800°C. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples with similar MoO3 loadings but different ZrO2 contents. For MCM-41 loaded with molybdena only, the ordered structure of MCM-41 collapsed completely after calcination at 750°C. Other researchers have also observed similar results. Wong et al. [24] reported that MCM-41 impregnated with 6wt.% MoO3 suffered a drastic destruction of MCM-41. Cho et al. [25] obtained amorphous structure for Mo-MCM-41 with Mo loadings up to ca. 10%. It is of great interest to notice that the ordered structure of MCM-41 was well preserved when zirconia was concomitantly introduced with molybdena. Four distinct diffraction peaks corresponding to 100, 110, 200, 210 planes of MCM-41 are visible for 8–10% MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 with ZrO2 content in the range of 4–22wt.%. These results imply that the MoO x species on MoO3/MCM-41 sample probably interact with the framework of MCM-41 strongly and destroy the structure. However, if MCM-41 is coated with Zr(OH)4 first, MoO x species then interact with ZrO2 instead of the silica framework of MCM-41 so that the ordered structure of MCM-41 is retained. Moreover, no diffraction peaks due to MoO3 or ZrO2 crystallites were observed on all these samples. Therefore, MoO3 and ZrO2 should be well dispersed on the surface of MCM-41. The TEM photographs (not shown) also confirmed that the hexagonal meso-structure of MCM-41 was still retained and MoO3/ZrO2 crystals were mainly in the channels of MCM-41. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 with similar ZrO2 contents but different MoO3 loadings. It can be seen that the patterns of samples with MoO3 loadings varying in 2–9wt.% are similar to that of MCM-41 loaded with 14% ZrO2 only. Within this range of MoO3 loading, the MoO3 seems to interact with ZrO2 and has little effect on the crystal structure of MCM-41. When the MoO3 loading is raised to 14wt.%, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of MCM-41 decreases drastically. Even further increase in the MoO3 loading to 17wt.%, caused the ordered structure of MCM-41 to collapse completely. In the mean time, the diffraction peaks corresponding to ZrMo2O8 phase [26] appeared. Based on the XRD results, the maximum loadings of MoO3 and ZrO2 on MCM-41 to retain the crystal structure of MCM-41 are 14 and 22wt.%, respectively. Iglesia and co-workers [27–29] reported that when the Mo surface density was higher than 5Mo/nm2 and the calcination temperature was above 600°C, ZrMo2O8 was the predominant structure on MoO x /ZrO2 samples due to the strong interactions between MoO x and ZrO2. Our MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples calcined at 750°C with MoO3 and ZrO2 loadings lower than 14 and 22%, respectively, do not show any diffraction peaks corresponding to ZrMo2O8. In these cases, the ordered structure of MCM-41 is still retained. Although MoO3 and ZrO2 have strong interactions, the well-dispersed ZrO2 on the surface of MCM-41 has a high surface area. As a result, the Mo surface density was lower than that for forming ZrMo2O8 structure. Above these loadings, the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 would collapses. Then, MoO3 and ZrO2 would have the opportunity to sinter together and form the ZrMo2O8 phase. The physical properties measured from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The calcined parent MCM-41 sample has a BET surface area of 1085m2/g and pore volume of 1.0cm3/g. It also has a very narrow pore size distribution centered at 27Å. After molybdena and zirconia were supported on MCM-41, the surface area, pore volume and mesopore diameter decrease with the metal oxide loading. These results imply that the supported oxides should be dispersed onto the internal surfaces of the mesopores of MCM-41. BET analyses show that the supported catalysts have much larger surface areas (>500m2/g) than the unsupported MoO3/ZrO2 (<100m2/g). Table 1 also shows that the surface area, pore volume and mesopore diameter decrease with the increase in calcination temperature. These results are in consistence with those observed from XRD studies. Synchrotron radiation based on X-ray absorption spectra at Mo L3-edge were taken because the data provided information on the local coordination symmetry (especially tetrahedral versus octahedral) of Mo [30–35]. The L3-edge spectrum of Mo(VI) is characterized by two absorption peaks, which are assigned to the electron transition from an initial state of p-level to the excited states of predominantly d-character. For Mo in the tetrahedral field, the splitting of the d-orbitals (e and t2) should be smaller than that in octahedral field (t2g and eg). Moreover, the number of orbitals is also reflected in the relative intensity of the two transitions. Mo in tetrahedral environment has two peaks in L3-edge spectra with an approximately 2:3 (e below t2) ratio in the peak intensity while that in octahedral coordination has a 3:2 (t2g below eg) ratio. Fig. 4 illustrates the Mo L3-edge spectra of MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples with different MoO3 loadings, along with that of α-MoO3 (octahedral Mo6+), Na2MoO4 (tetrahedral Mo6+) and ZrMo2O8 (tetrahedral Mo6+). It is readily seen that all the MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples with MoO3 loading lower than 14wt.% have the L3-edge spectra in agreement with Mo in octahedral coordination. However, 17% MoO3/13% ZrO2/MCM-41 sample has tetrahedral Mo6+. From the XRD results, we know that ZrMo2O8 is formed in this sample. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was performed to determine the amount and the strength of acid sites on the catalysts. Fig. 5 compares the NH3-TPD profile of MoO3/ZrO2 supported on MCM-41 with those of siliceous MCM-41, Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al=31 analyzed by ICP-AES), MoO3/ZrO2 mechanically mixed with MCM-41, and MoO3/ZrO2 supported on silica gel. The MoO3 and ZrO2 contents in the three supported samples were similar, 4% MoO3 and 13–17% ZrO2. Siliceous MCM-41 shows no desorption peak (profile a), indicating that it has no acidity. The MoO3/ZrO2 mechanically mixed with MCM-41 shows a very weak desorption peak maximized around 230°C (profile b), while that supported on MCM-41 has a strong desorption peak with the maximum at 203°C (profile c). The MoO3/ZrO2 supported on silica gel (profile d) also exhibits a strong desorption peak at ca. 218°C, but the peak intensity is weaker than that of MCM-41. Al-MCM-41 has a broad desorption peak centered at ca. 260°C (profile b), and the peak intensity is weaker than that of supported MoO3/ZrO2. The TPD profiles of HY-zeolites with Si/Al atomic ratio of 24 and 2.7 are also shown in Fig. 5 as references. The one with a high Al content (Si/Al=2.7) has two huge desorption peaks at ca. 200 and 350°C, corresponding to sites of weak and strong acidities, respectively. It implies that this sample has huge amounts of acid sites, and the amount of weak acid sites is greater than that of the strong ones. On the other hand, the HY-zeolite with low Al content (Si/Al=24) has more sites of strong acidity, although its acid amount is relatively low. In comparison, the supported MoO3/ZrO2 samples and Al-MCM-41 have most of their acid sites in the weak acidity region. The results also demonstrate that MoO3/ZrO2 supported on either MCM-41 or silica gel contains much more acid sites than the unsupported sample or the physical mixture. These results accompanying with the BET results in Table 1 suggest that supporting MoO3/ZrO2 on MCM-41 can form mixed oxide of high dispersion and generate a large amount of acid sites with relatively weak acid strength. Moreover, the acid strength is close to that of Al-MCM-41 and silica supported sample. Fig. 6 compares the NH3-TPD profiles of MCM-41 supported MoO3/ZrO2 with nearly the same ZrO2 content but different MoO3 loadings. For the 14% ZrO2/MCM-41 sample without MoO3, only a small desorption peak can be seen (profile a). This suggests that supporting ZrO2 onto MCM-41 can only generate a small amount of weak acid sites. When both MoO3 and ZrO2 were supported on MCM-41, the amount of acid sites increased drastically, while the acid strength does not change significantly. Especially when the MoO3 loading is increased from 4 to 9%, the TPD profiles show an additional desorption shoulder appearing at 244°C other than the main peak at 206°C. It implies that both the amount of acid sites and the acid strength increase with the MoO3 loading. However, when the MoO3 loading is increased further to 17%, only one desorption peak at 205°C is seen, and the peak area is lower than that containing 4% MoO3. As described above, the 17% MoO3 sample loses the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and the predominant species is found to be ZrMo2O8. Furthermore, this sample has a very low BET surface area. These results imply that ZrMo2O8 probably has little contribution to the acidity. In order to examine the effect of surface adsorbed water on acidity, the 4% MoO3/13% ZrO2/MCM-41 sample was pre-treated with water vapor at 50°C for 1h, followed by NH3-TPD experiment from 50 to 700°C. Fig. 6(e) shows that the acidity of the sample is basically unaffected by adsorbing water on the surface. The new huge peak that appeared at ca. 100°C is attributed to the physically adsorbed ammonia. The DRIFT spectra of pyridine adsorbed on MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 were taken to distinguish the Brönsted and Lewis acid nature of the acid sites. Fig. 7 shows the DRIFT spectra of 9% MoO3/13% ZrO2/MCM-41 after adsorption of pyridine and desorption at various temperatures. It can be seen that only Lewis acid sites, showing the bands at 1450, 1487 and 1609cm−1, are present on the sample. That is similar to the acid character observed on molybdena loaded zirconia [6]. Two peaks corresponding to H-bonded pyridine appearing at 1446 and 1597cm−1 disappear after heating to 200°C. No Brönsted acid sites (characteristic at ca. 1550cm−1) are observed [14,36]. With the increase in desorption temperature, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of Lewis acid sites decreases. The preservation of the pyridine peaks up to ca. 400°C implies that the strength of Lewis acid sites on MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 catalyst is not very weak. These results further suggest that ZrO2 as well dispersed particles probably forms a thin layer on the surface of MCM-41, and MoO3 is coated on ZrO2 and has little interaction with the silica wall. 3.2 Catalytic studies The catalytic properties of MCM-41 supported MoO3/ZrO2 were investigated in the condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone to synthesize 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl) propane (BMP). Table 2 compares the results of condensation of MF with acetone over MCM-41 mesoporous silica and MoO3/ZrO2 loaded on different supports. In the blank test reaction without any catalyst, no reaction occurs between MF and acetone. Pure siliceous MCM-41 also cannot catalyze the reaction. The three MoO3/ZrO2 containing catalysts give very high selectivities to BMP (90–96%). Among them, the catalysts prepared by impregnation gave higher MF conversion than the one prepared by physical mixing, and the one supported on MCM-41 was better than that on silica gel. These results are consistent with the acid amounts observed by NH3-TPD studies. The sample, which contains the largest amount of acid sites, gives the highest activity. Because NH3-TPD and DRIFT spectra show that these samples contain no strong acid sites, these results suggest that the condensation of 2-methylfuran with acetone does not need very strong acidity to catalyze the reaction. It is also noticeable that the MF conversion is very low over HY (Si/Al=2.7) while the catalytic activity of HY (Si/Al=24) is close to those of supported MoO3/ZrO2. Moreover, both the MF conversion and BMP selectivity are relatively low over Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al=31). The extremely low catalytic activity of HY (Si/Al=2.7) is attributed to the rapid deactivation of the catalyst, although no tar is detectable. The pores of HY were probably blocked by the oligomeric products of MF or the high ordered aldol condensation products of acetone since the dimer and trimer of aldol condensation products were detected in the liquid products over this catalyst. The product analysis also shows that the relatively low selectivity observed on Al-MCM-41 is due to some MF forming dimmer through alkylation. We also compared the effect of the MF/acetone molar ratio on the MF conversion and BMP selectivity on 10% MoO3/7% ZrO2/MCM-41. When the stoichiometric ratio of MF/acetone (2:1) is used, the MF conversion is high (91%), but the BMP selectivity is relatively low (87%). When the amount of acetone is increased, the MF conversions decrease to 78–84%, while the BMP selectivity increases to 96%. These results are elucidated by assuming that acetone in this reaction is a reactant but can also serve as the solvent. Lack of solvent may accelerate the oligomerization of 2-methylfuran. As a result, the MF conversion is high but the BMP selectivity is low. Although addition of more acetone dilutes MF and results in lower conversion, it ultimately helps to suppress MF oligomerization. In the following studies, a relatively high acetone/MF ratio was used. Table 3 shows the MF conversion and BMP selectivity over 10% MoO3/7% ZrO2/MCM-41 catalyst calcined at various temperatures. The MF conversion increases with the calcination temperature from 560 to 750°C. However, the conversion decreases slightly when the calcination temperature reaches 800°C. On the other hand, the BMP selectivity is independent of the calcination temperature and always has a value near 96%. It is also interesting to find that the optimal catalytic activity of MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 in the condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone is very similar to that of sulfonic acid functionalized MCM-41, 81% versus 82% BMP yield. The latter was reported by Van Rhijn et al. [22] based on the same catalyst weight and reaction conditions. Tables 4 and 5 compare the catalytic results of MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 with different MoO3 or ZrO2 contents. It is seen that ZrO2/MCM-41 without MoO3 shows very low catalytic activity, in both conversion and selectivity. The conversion of MF increases markedly with the increase in MoO3 loading, while the selectivity of BMP is kept constant around 95%. The catalytic activity is consistent with the variation in surface area and the amount of acid sites. The 9% MoO3/13% ZrO2/MCM-41 has the largest amount of acid sites, and it shows the highest activity. On the 17% MoO3/13% ZrO2/MCM-41 sample, the activity decreases greatly. This sample shows very small amount of acid sites. In this case, the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 also collapses, and ZrMo2O8 is the predominant species. We also tested the activity of ZrMo2O8 sample, but it showed no catalytic activity. Over the catalysts with 8–10wt.% MoO3, nearly no change in the BMP selectivity is observed when the ZrO2 content is changed. It is also noticeable that the 8wt.% MoO3/MCM-41 catalyst without ZrO2 still has 46% MF conversion, indicating that MoO3 is the main contribution to the acidity. However, the crystal structure of MCM-41 would be destroyed completely and a material of low surface area is obtained if MoO3 is loaded along (as shown in Fig. 2(a)). By introducing Zr(OH)4 on MCM-41 first before impregnation of MoO3, the zirconium and molybdenum mixed oxide is formed and well dispersed on MCM-41 surfaces. Compared to the catalytic activity of MoO3/MCM-41 catalyst without ZrO2, the MF conversion increases markedly when ZrO2 is also present and reaches a maximum value on the catalyst with 7–13wt.% ZrO2 contents. These results also indicate that a proper ratio of MoO3/ZrO2 is required in order to achieve the optimal catalytic activity. From the XRD studies, 9% MoO3 and 13% ZrO2 were the maximum loadings on MCM-41 to preserve the hexagonal structure without the formation of ZrO2, MoO3 crystals or ZrMo2O8 species. Consistently, MCM-41 with this loading of MoO3/ZrO2 gave the highest catalytic activity. The deactivation behavior of the catalyst was examined by recycling the 2% MoO3/14% ZrO2/MCM-41 catalyst. The catalyst after 24h reaction was filtered and calcined at 700°C for 3h, then used in the second time catalytic reaction. The result is shown in Table 4. The catalyst shows a minor decrease in the activity after the recycle, but the selectivity of BMP was found to still remain as high as 95–96%. These results indicate that the catalyst is not deactivated significantly and is of practical use. 4 Conclusions MoO3/ZrO2 mixed oxides supported on siliceous MCM-41 were successfully prepared. The hexagonal ordered structure of MCM-41 was well preserved and no crystalline structure of MoO3 or ZrO2 appeared for up to 8–10wt.% MoO3 loading and 13–14wt.% ZrO2 loading. In these ranges of loading, the molybdena and zirconia are highly dispersed on the MCM-41 surface. XANES spectra showed that Mo was in octahedral coordination, and that no ZrMo2O8 crystals were formed. Impregnation of MCM-41 with MoO3 tends to destroy the mesoporous structure; however, the structure was well preserved when the wall of MCM-41 was first coated with ZrO2. A stronger interaction between MoO3 and ZrO2 than that of MoO3 and SiO2 was probably the reason. The MoO3 and ZrO2 loadings higher than 14wt.% and 13%, respectively, would lead to the formation of ZrMo2O8 species. The MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples with well dispersed MoO3 and ZrO2 showed high surface areas and weak to medium acidity. Only Lewis acidity was observed on this material. The materials were highly efficient in catalyzing the condensation of 2-methylfuran and acetone with a high selectivity of 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl)propane. MCM-41 with 9% MoO3/13% ZrO2 gave the highest catalytic activity. This combination was also the maximum amount of their loadings on MCM-41 with the hexagonal structure preserved and without the formation of ZrO2, MoO3 crystals or ZrMo2O8 species. Therefore, this loading should give the highest dispersion of Mo and Zr mixed oxide on MCM-41.

        "dc:description": "Molybdenum and zirconium mixed oxides were supported on siliceous MCM-41 mesoporous material. The resultant materials were characterized with various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), XANES, NH3-TPD, and Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of pyridine. It was found that the well-ordered channeling pores of MCM-41 were retained with a maximum loading of 9wt.% MoO3 and 13wt.% ZrO2. The ZrMo2O8 crystallites appeared with an even higher loading. The materials had surface areas greater than 500m2/g and a relatively narrow pore size distribution. MoO3 and ZrO2 were well dispersed inside the pores of MCM-41. The Mo(VI) was found in octahedral coordination when no ZrMo2O8 crystallites were detected. The MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 samples contained only Lewis acid sites. Although NH3-TPD experiments indicated that its acid strength was weaker than that of Y-zeolite, the MoO3/ZrO2/MCM-41 materials were excellent catalysts for liquid phase condensation of 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetone to form 2,2-bis(5-methylfuryl)propane (BMP).",
