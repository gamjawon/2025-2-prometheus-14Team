Recteur Pineau, 86022 Poitiers Cedex, France Received 27 July 1993; accepted 30 November 1993 Abstract The transformation of cyclohexanone was carried out on PtHZSM5 catalysts under the following conditions: flow reactor, 473 K, pressures of cyclohexanone and hydrogen equal to 0.25 and 0.75 bar respectively. Six families of products were identified by GC or GC-MS analysis: C6 cyclic hydrocarbons 1, C,2 bicyclic hydrocarbons 2 (e.g., cyclohexylcyclohexene), cyclohexenylcyclohexanone 3, cyclohexylcyclohexanone 4, phenylcyclohexanone 5, tricyclic ketones 6 (e.g., biscyclohexeny1cyclohexanone). A reaction scheme is proposed to explain the formation of these products. Compounds 1 would result from the following steps: hydrogenation of cyclohexanone (probably in the enol form) on Pt sites, dehydration of cyclohexanol on the acid sites, hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on Pt sites. Compounds 2 are mainly formed through successive transformations of 4: hydrogenation, dehydration...; 3 results from aldolisation of cyclohexanone followed by dehydration of the resulting alcohol, 4 from hydrogenation of 3, 5 from dehydrogenation of 3. The compounds 6 result from aldolisation of 3 with cyclohexanone followed by dehydration, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation steps. The dehydration of alcohols is much more rapid than aldolisation and hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps. On a 0.2 PtHZSM5 catalyst with a platinum dispersion greater than 70%, aldolisation is slower than hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps. The deactivation of the catalyst affects more the acid sites than the metallic ones.

Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 1. Introduction . Various processes of refining and petrochemistry i.e., hydroisomerization of C5_ C6 alkanes or of the C8 aromatic cut, hydrocracking,... use zeolite bifunctional catalysts in which the acid function is provided by the protonic sites of a zeolite and the hydrogenating function by noble metals or mixed sulphides [ 1-3 ] . These catalysts present the advantage of carrying out in one operation transformations requiring several successive steps catalyzed by acid or by hydrodehydrogenating sites. These catalysts can also be used for the synthesis of functional compounds [ 4] . Thus it has been shown that the acetone transformation into methylisobutyl ketone which requires successive steps: aldolisation of acetone, dehydration of the resulting diacetone alcohol, then hydrogenation of the mesityl oxide could be carried out in one step on Pt or PdMFI zeolites [ 5-7 ] . PtHZSM5 zeolites are used here to catalyze the same type of transformation in the case of cyclohexanone. Cyclohexylcyclohexanone which is obtained through this transformation can be dehydrogenated into o-phenylphenol which is an important wide-spectrum conservative [ 8 ] . The reaction scheme will be established and the effect of the hydrogenating activity on the activity and the selectivity will be determined. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts HZSM5 (Nao.2113.2A13AS192.60192) was obtained through ion exchange with NH4Cl followed by calcination at 793 K under a 10-h dry air flow, of a commercial sample supplied by Conteka (CB V 5020) . The PtHZSM5 catalysts (about 0.05 and 0.2 Pt wt. %) were prepared under the conditions previously reported [ 9 ] . Platinum was introduced by competitive ion exchange (72 h with 24 h stirring) with a 1/100 (Pt (NH3)4) C12/NH4 N03 ratio. Calcination was carried out under the following conditions: air flow rate: 201 - h -1; 4 h heating at 453 K; 1 K/min temperature increase to 573 K then 6 h heating at this temperature. Reduction was carried out under hydrogen flow (41 - h -1) for 6 h at 773 K. The two samples were characterized by their activity for toluene hydrogenation in a flow reactor at 383 K with phydrogen 0.9 bar and Ptoluene = 0.1 bar. Toluene hydrogenation is a so-called structure non-sensitive reaction [ 10] i.e., the rate is proportional to the number of accessible platinum atoms. This was checked for 4 samples of PtHZSM5 samples of which the number of accessible platinum atoms was estimated from transmission electron microscopy experiments (7). Therefore the platinum dispersion of the 0.05 and 0.2 PtHZSM5 catalysts can be estimated from their activity for toluene hydrogenation. This dispersion was equal to about 50% and 70% for 0.05 and 0.2 PtHZSM5, respectively. F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 2.2. Cyclohexanone transformation 69 The reaction was carried out in a flow reactor at 473 K, under atmospheric pressure with a hydrogen /cyclohexanone molar ratio of 3. The reaction products were condensed at the reactor outlet, then analyzed by gas liquid chromatography (GC) using a CPSiI 5 CB capillary column with 50 m of length and 0.25 mm of interior diameter. In order to study the influence of contact time on the catalytic properties, different catalyst weights (15-850 mg) and different flows of liquid cyclohexanone (1.53.75 cm3/h) were used. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 cyclohexylbenzene, 2-phenylcyclohexanol, 2-cyclohexylcyclohexanone were identified by comparison in GC with reference compounds. The other products were identified through GC-MS coupling. Table 1 gives the main reaction products classified into six families. The same products were obtained from cyclohexanone transformation on PtHY catalysts [ 11 ] . The compounds of family 1 result from the following steps: hydrogenation of cyclohexanone (probably in the enol form) on Pt sites, dehydration of cyclohexanol on the acid sites, hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on the Pt sites (Eq. 1) fl I H2 H20 H/ 0 Pt Fi+ O P (1 ) --~ (0 As was the case with acetone [ 7 ] the dehydration step is more rapid than the hydrogenation step and cyclohexanol is not observed in the products. The compounds of family 2 could result from the dimerization of cyclohexene on the acid sites (Eq. 2): 2 0 H--;_ CFJO (2) The cyclohexylcyclohexene can be hydrogenated into bicyclohexane or dehydrogenated into cyclohexylbenzene. These compounds can also result from the transformation of 2-cyclohexylcyclohexanone (Eq. 3), Table 1 Reaction products with their molar weight M in parentheses Family Products 1 cyclohexene (82), cyclohexane (84), benzene (78), methylcyclopentenes (82) and methylcyclopentane (84) 2 bicyclic compounds: bicyclohexenes (162), cyclohexylcyclohexenes (164), bicyclohexane (166), cyclohexylbenzene (160) 3 cyclohexenylcyclohexanone isomers (178) and a small amount of methylcyclopentenylcyclohexanone 4 2-cyclohexylcyclohexanone (180) 5 phenylcyclohexanone (174), 2-phenylcyclohexanol (176), cyclohexylphenol (176), o-phenylphenol (170) and a small amount of other products with M=172 and 176 6 tricyclic compounds such as biscyclohexenylcyclohexanones (258), cyclohexenylcyclohexylcyclohexanones (260), biscyclohexylcyclohexanone (262), cyclohexenylcyclohexylbenzene(240) F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 as has been shown experimentally [ 11 ] . The cyclohexylcyclohexanol intermediate is not observed, which confirms the high rate of alcohol dehydration on the acid sites of HZSM5. The cyclohexenylcyclohexanone isomers (the main products of family 3) result from two successive steps catalyzed by the protonic acid sites: aldolisation of cyclohexanone then dehydration of the resulting alcohol (Eq. 4): O O O HO H+ O H20 2 H,. The mechanism of aldolisation is shown in Fig. 2. As was the case with acetone the alcohol intermediate is not observed, which shows that alcohol dehydration compared to the aldolisation step is very rapid. The methylcyclopentenylcyclohexanone is formed through skeletal isomerization of the cyclohexenylcyclohexanone on the acid sites. This isomerization occurs through protonated cyclopropane intermediates as shown below in the example of cyclohexene (Eq. 5) O H+_ O+ _ O _~+d _~00 (5) The cyclohexylcyclohexanone (family 4) which is the product expected from the bifunctional conversion of cyclohexanone results from the hydrogenation of cyclohexenylcyclohexanone compounds on the hydrogenating sites. The compounds of family 5 result from dehydrogenation and/or hydrogenation of cyclohexenylcyclohexanone isomers. It has been shown experimentally that Fig. 2. Mechanism of cyclohexanone aldolisation on protonic sites. 72 F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 these compounds were not formed through transformation of cyclohexylcyclohexanone [11]. The main compound in family 6 is the biscyclohexenylcyclohexanone. This compound is likely to have resulted from aldolic condensation of cyclohexenylcyclohexanone with cyclohexanone followed by the rapid dehydration of the alcohol produced (Eq.6): O O O 0 i c tc> 0-1 +( H+ -H 20i The probable scheme of cyclohexanone transformation is indicated in Fig. 3. It must be emphasized that the formation of compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 requires both acid and hydrogenating sites (bifunctional catalysis) while that of compounds 3 and 6 (at least biscyclohexenylcyclohexanone which is the main 6 compound) requires only acid sites. These latter compounds and particularly the cyclohexeny1cyclohexanone are furthermore the main products of cyclohexanone transformation on pure HZSM5 (a small amount of cyclohexene and benzene is also observed). From this reaction scheme it is clear that although alcohols (A, B, C) are necessarily reaction intermediates, these compounds are never observed in the reaction products. This shows that the dehydration of alcohols is much more rapid than their formation through aldolisation or hydrogenation of ketones. ~a ` H\\2AH2 6 +I20 A b\\: 0 \"' H 0-10 &C _Ri~ B 3 H+ \\ hi _z 2 CFOJ Fig. 3. Reaction scheme of cyclohexanone transformation over PtH7.SM5 catalysts. F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 73 3.2. Influence of the contact time. Relative rates of the reaction steps Fig. 4 shows how the conversion, X, for 4 values of the contact time, 0, changes with time on stream, t. Whatever the value of 0, X decreases when t increases. The value of X obtained for t equal to 10 min is higher than that expected from the extrapolation of the curve X vs. t drawn with the other t values. This could be due to an initial increase of the temperature of the catalyst (up to 3 K for high values of 9) caused by the exothermicity of the reaction. That is why this X value was not taken into account for estimation by extrapolation of the curve X vs. t fort=0 the conversion on the non-deactivated catalyst (XQ) (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows that Xo is proportional to B up to values of XQ of 10-15%. A straight line was also obtained for the transformation of cyclohexanone on a 0.2 PtHY catalyst. This catalyst which has twice as many acid sites as the 0.2 PtHZSM5 catalyst, is 3.5 times more active. Therefore the activity per acid site of PtHZSM5 catalysts is about half that of the PtHY catalysts, which can be related to an effect of the zeolite pore structure. Differences in the product distributions are also observed; in particular lower amounts of the bulkier products 6 and greater amounts of the smaller products 1 with PtHZSM5 catalysts, the other products (3+4) being formed in equivalent amounts. Limitations in the desorption of the bulky compounds from the pores of HZSM5 are probably responsible for the differences in activity and in selectivity with PtHY catalysts. Part of the bulkier compounds 6 could also be formed on the outer surface of the HZSM5 crystallites. The same procedure was used for estimating the yields in the products of the six families (defined in Table 1) on the non-deactivated catalyst. These yields are plotted vs. 8 in Fig. 6. From these figures it can be concluded that the compounds of families 1, 3, 4 and 5 are apparent primary products while those of families 2 10 5u 0 8 4 X0 40 6 ~ 3fl ~t 4 iC 20 ~.

Moreover the cyclohexenylcyclohexanone (family 3) which is very rapidly formed also undergoes a rapid secondary transformation into other products, as is indicated by the maximum in the curve of formation of this compound. This is in agreement with Fig. 3 which indicates that compounds of families 4, 5 and 6 result from the transformation of the cyclohexenylcyclohexanone. A maximum is also observed in the curves of formation of the compounds of family 4 which can be transformed into the compounds of family 2 but also in the curves of formation of the compounds of families 5 and 6. Hence these latter compounds undergo secondary reactions probably leading to heavy products. These heavy products retained in the pores of the zeolite are probably responsible for the deactivation [ 12] . The same conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 7 which gives the initial yield in each family of products as a function of the conversion Xo. Concerning the relative rates of the reactions involved in cyclohexanone transformation it can be concluded that: (i) The dehydration of alcohols is much more rapid than the other reactions catalyzed by the Pt or the acid sites (hydrogenation of cyclohexanone or of the cyclohexylcyclohexanone, aldolisation). Indeed the alcohol intermediates (A, B and C, Fig. 3) were never found in the reaction products. The dehydration of tertiary alcohols (e.g., B) but also of secondary alcohols (A and C) is therefore more rapid than aldolisation. This could be due to limitations in the rate of bimolecular reactions by steric constraints in the narrow pores of the ZSM5 zeolite or to differences in the strength of the acid sites involved in aldolisation and in dehydration. The second proposal is the more likely since no alcohol is found in the products of cyclohexanone transformation on PtHY catalysts [ 11 ] for which no steric constraint is expected. (ii) The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclohexenylcyclohexanone F.

Indeed, compounds 4 and 5 appear as primary products although according to Fig. 3 they result from the secondary transformation of 3. However Fig. 8 shows that the ratio of 76 F.

Initial value of the ratio between the rates of formation of the 3 and 4 compounds (3/4) vs. contact time, O (S). formation of the compounds of families 3 and 4 is high at zero contact time. This means that in the formation of 4 the hydrogenation step is not much more rapid than the aldolisation step. In agreement with the lower rate of aldolisation compared to that of the hydrogenation of the C-C double bonds, the compounds 6 appear as secondary products. However it is most likely that the formation of these bulky compounds is also limited by steric constraints. (iii) The hydrogenation of the C=C bond (e.g., 3-4, Fig. 3) is much more rapid than the hydrogenation of the C=O bond (4 - 2). Indeed the 2 compounds do not appear as primary products while 4 seems to be directly formed from F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 77 cyclohexanone. However the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone (likely in the enol form) is rapid since the compounds 1 are formed at the same rate as 4. 3.3. Influence of the hydrogenating activity Fig. 5 shows that 0.05 PtHZSM5 is about half as active as 0.2 PtHZSM5. The formation of the compounds of families 1, 2, 4 and 5 is slower, that of the cyclohexenylcyclohexanone 3 occurs at the same rate with both catalysts while that of the 6 compounds is initially greater on 0.05 PtHZSM5 (Fig. 6). This means that the rates of all the reactions occurring through bifunctional catalysis decrease with the Pt content, hence with the accessible platinum surface area while the rates of the reactions occurring through acid catalysis are either not affected (formation of 3) or increased (formation of the compounds 6). Initially the formation of the compounds 1 is about 3 times slower on 0.05 PtHZSM5 than on 0.2 PtHZSM5, whose accessible Pt area is 5 times greater. This seems to indicate that this formation is limited both by the acid and the hydrogenation steps. The hydrogenation of cyclohexanone should be however the limiting step, for cyclohexanol was not found in the products. The formation of the cyclohexylcyclohexanone compound 4 is also strongly affected by the decrease in the hydrogenating activity. With 0.05 PtHZSM5 this compound is a secondary product (Fig. 6) whereas it appears as a primary product with 0.2 PtHZSM5. This confirms that on these catalysts hydrogenation of 3 is not much faster than its formation through aldolisation. In agreement with this, for the values of contact time of 0.38, 0.72 and 1.9 s, the formation of 4 on 0.05 PtHZSM5 is 0.625 to 0.5 times that on 0.2 PtHZSM5. This formation is therefore limited both by the acid and the hydrogenation steps. Because of the decrease in the hydrogenation step the maximum in 3 is greater on 0.05 PtHZSM5 than on 0.2 PtHZSM5. Like the compounds 4, the compounds 5 are not directly formed on 0.05 PtHZSM5. This shows that the hydrodehydrogenation steps leading from 3 to 5 and the formation of 3 through aldolisation have rates of the same order of magnitude. The rate of production of the compounds 6 is greater with 0.05 PtHZSM5 than with 0.2 PtHZSM5 (Fig. 6f) which could be due to the greater amount of cyclohexenylcyclohexanone formed on the 0.05 PtHZSM5 catalyst (Fig. 6c). However for the highest value of 0 the contrary is found. This could be attributed to a secondary transformation of the 6 compounds into non-desorbed products ( I 'coke\"). 3.4. Influence of the deactivation on the formation of the various products In order to specify the relative influence of the deactivation on the acid and on the metallic sites the initial yields in the compounds of families 1 to 6 given in Fig. 78 F. Alvarez et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 67-79 7 were compared to the yields obtained during the deactivation of 0.2 PtHZSM5 for the longest contact time ( 9= 3.3 s). For the same value of conversion the yields in the compounds 3 and 5 are lower, whereas those in the other compounds are practically unchanged. This can be interpreted by a more pronounced deactivation of the acid than of the hydrogenating sites. Indeed, the formation of the compounds 3 which involves only acid reactions is more limited than the formation of the compounds 1, whose limiting step is the cyclohexanone hydrogenation on the Pt sites. This more pronounced deactivation of the acid sites means that the heavy compounds responsible for deactivation are probably formed and deposited preferentially at the channel intersections the furthest away from the metallic sites. 4. Conclusion On PtHZSM5 catalyst cyclohexanone can be transformed into various compounds either through a purely acid mechanism or through a bifunctional one. The acid sites are responsible for aldolisation of ketones and for dehydration of alcohols, this latter reaction being much more rapid. The metallic sites are responsible for hydrogenation of -C=C and -C=O (or -C=C-OH) bonds and for dehydrogenation into aromatics. On a 0.2 PtHZSM5 catalyst the bifunctional formation of C6 cyclic hydrocarbons is limited by the hydrogenation step while the formation of cyclohexylcyclohexanone is mainly limited by the aldolisation step. However the hydrogenation of cyclohexylcyclohexanone is not much more rapid than the aldolisation step. The deactivation more significantly affects the acid than the metallic sites.

The transformation of cyclohexanone was carried out on PtHZSM5 catalysts under the following conditions: flow reactor, 473 K, pressures of cyclohexanone and hydrogen equal to 0.25 and 0.75 bar respectively. Six families of products were identified by GC or GC-MS analysis: C6 cyclic hydrocarbons 1, C12 bicyclic hydrocarbons 2 (e.g., cyclohexylcyclohexene), cyclohexenylcyclohexanone 3, cyclohexylcyclohexanone 4, phenylcyclohexanone 5, tricyclic ketones 6 (e.g., biscyclohexenylcyclohexanone). A reaction scheme is proposed to explain the formation of these products. Compounds 1 would result from the following steps: hydrogenation of cyclohexanone (probably in the enol form) on Pt sites, dehydration of cyclohexanol on the acid sites, hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on Pt sites. Compounds 2 are mainly formed through successive transformations of 4: hydrogenation, dehydration…; 3 results from aldolisation of cyclohexanone followed by dehydration of the resulting alcohol, 4 from hydrogenation of 3, 5 from dehydrogenation of 3. The compounds 6 result from aldolisation of 3 with cyclohexanone followed by dehydration, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation steps. The dehydration of alcohols is much more rapid than aldolisation and hydrogenation—dehydrogenation steps. On a 0.2 PtHZSM5 catalyst with a platinum dispersion greater than 70%, aldolisation is slower than hydrogenation—dehydrogenation steps. The deactivation of the catalyst affects more the acid sites than the metallic ones. Keywords cyclohexanone hydrogen HZSM5 platinum References [1] Kh.M. Minachev Ya.I. Isakov J.A.
