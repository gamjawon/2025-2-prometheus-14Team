Introduction Over the past decades, gold catalysts have been widely conâ€� sidered as outstanding catalysts for oxidation of CO [1,2] and other compounds [3â€“5]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed on solid carriers are attractive as catalysts because of their increased stability, high activity under mild conditions, and easy recovery compared with bulk Au or free AuNPs [6,7]. Tin dioxide (SnO2) is an nâ€�type semiconductor with a wide band gap. In recent years, SnO2 has been extensively studied for various applications in catalysis [8], gas sensing [9], and reâ€� chargeable Li batteries [10]. Bulk and supported SnO2 are also effective catalysts for selective reduction of NO x by hydrocarâ€� bons [11,12]. There are many reports of gold catalysts disâ€� persed on semiconductor metal oxides [13] such as TiO2 [14], Î±â€�Fe2O3 [15], and Co3O4 [16]. However, the studies on Au supâ€� ported on SnO2 have mainly focused on sensors [17], electrodes with indium tin oxide [18], and catalytic oxidation of CO [19,20]. In addition, these materials were limited to coreâ€�shell structures [19,21] or gold particles dispersed on SnO2 by coâ€� precipitation (CP) [20,22]. Au/SnO2 catalysts prepared by depâ€� ositionâ€�precipitation (DP) and their application in the oxidation of alcohols have not been reported. Compared with CP, DP possesses a significant advantage that all of the active components remain on the surface of the support and none is buried within its bulk [23]. DP is readily scalable and works for any type of support. Usually, it allows complete precipitation of a gold precursor from solution * Corresponding author.

J.Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 LI Xian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 1013â€“1019 (<0.1% Au is left in the liquid phase), whereas more than 50% of gold remains in solution after CP [23,24]. Au/Fe2O3 prepared by DP exhibits higher catalytic activity in CO oxidation than that fabricated by CP [23]. Therefore, we prepared a series of Au/SnO2 catalysts by DP under a range of controlled conditions and used them to catalyze the oxidation of alcohols. Lactones and their derivatives are widely distributed in naâ€� ture and industry where they are used as solvents, extraction agents and intermediates in agriculture, the petroleum indusâ€� try, pharmaceuticals, resins, and fibers [25â€“28]. The aerobic oxidation of 1,4â€�butanediol is promising as an industrially acâ€� ceptable process [5]. Some supported gold catalysts induce conversion of 1,4â€�butanediol to ï�§â€�butyrolactone with high perâ€� formance [29â€“31], including that we previously reported nâ€�type semiconductor TiO2 as the carrier [32]. Herein, oxidative dehydrogenation of 1,4â€�butanediol to ï�§â€�butyrolactone is used as a test reaction to determine the activities of the series of Au/SnO2 catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Au/SnO2 catalysts were synthesized by homogeneous DP as follows. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (6.4 ml, 2.43 mmol/L) was mixed with deionized water (32 ml) at room temperature. Alkali was added as a precipitation agent to adjust the pH to the required value along with commercial SnO2 (1.0 g). The mixâ€� ture was stirred at 333 K for 2 h. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed five times with deionized water, and then dried in air overnight at 373 K. Finally, catalysts were calcined in air for 4 h at a desired temperature. For recycling tests, each used catalyst was washed with ethanol to remove contaminants and then calcined at 573 K in a muffle oven for 4 h. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The specific surface areas of samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Micromeritics Tristar ASAP 3000) using the Brunauerâ€�Emmettâ€�Teller (BET) method. Gold loadâ€� ings were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (Thermo E. IRIS). Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a diffractometer (Bruker D8 Adâ€� vance) with Cu KÎ± radiation (Î» = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 mA and 40 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) microâ€� graphs were obtained on a TEM (JOEL JEM 2010). The average size and relative distributions of gold particles were estimated from the sizes of more than 100 Au particles. Xâ€�ray photoelecâ€� tron spectra (XPS) were acquired under ultrahigh vacuum (<10 âˆ’6 Pa) at a pass energy of 93.90 eV on an XPS (Perâ€� kinâ€�Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA) equipped with a dual Xâ€�ray source using an Mg KÎ± anode (1253.6 eV) and a hemispherical energy analyzer. Binding energies were calibrated using adventitious carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV) as a reference. 2.3. Catalytic tests Catalytic tests were performed using a stainless steel autoâ€� clave equipped with a magnetic stirrer at 413 K. 1,4â€�Butanediol (1.645 g) was dissolved in tributyl phosphate (TBP, 20 ml). A specified amount of Au/SnO2 catalyst was added to give a moâ€� lar ratio of gold to 1,4â€�butanediol of 1:200. The autoclave was sealed and filled with air to a pressure of 1.2 MPa. The solution was stirred at a rate of 750 r/min. The reaction mixture was sampled at regular time intervals and analyzed by a gas chroâ€� matography(GC9560, Shanghai Huaai GC Co. Ltd)fitted with a flame ionization detector and PEGâ€�20M capillary column to determine the conversion and selectivity. Gas chromatogâ€� raphyâ€�mass spectrometry (GC 8000 TOFâ€�MS voyager) was used to detect the distribution of products. Recycling experiments using the Au/SnO2 catalysts were performed under identical reaction conditions to those above using recycled catalyst. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of catalysts The XRD patterns (not shown) indicated the carrier was standard SnO2 (JCPDS 41â€�1445). Although the BET area of plateâ€�like SnO2 (TEM image shown in Fig. 1(d)) was not large at just 11.3 m 2 /g, the vast majority of gold was successfully loadâ€� ed on the surface of the support, which was confirmed by XPS and TEM measurements, as shown in Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3. The good utilization of Au could be attributed to the use of DP to prepare the catalysts. The morphology, phase, and BET area of SnO2 showed little variation after Au NPs were deposited on (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 1. TEM images of Au/SnO2 with different pH. (a) pH = 6; (b) pH = 8; (c) pH = 9, (d) SnO2. LI Xian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 1013â€“1019 it according to Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3. Au diffraction peaks were not detected in the XRD patterns because the signals from Au and SnO2 overlapped. 3.2. Effect of preparation conditions on Au/SnO2 catalysts 3.2.1. Effect of pH It is usually considered that a suitable pH at different stages of catalyst preparation is favorable for nucleation, growth, and redispersion of Au NPs [33â€“35]. Under acidic or neutral condiâ€� tions, Au particles are difficult to disperse on the surface of SnO2, leading to low gold loading. When pH < 6, the average gold particle size was 50 nm (Fig. 1(a)) and the color of the catalyst was light purple. In strong basic solution (pH = 9.0), the structure of SnO2 was destroyed, the Au particle size increased to 25 nm (Fig. 1(c)) and the surface color turned to purpleâ€�red. When pH = 8.0, the resulting Au/SnO2 catalyst contained the smallest gold particles (3.9 nm, Fig. 1(b)) and the color was dark purple. 3.2.2. Effect of precipitant The precipitating agent clearly influences catalytic activity, so we prepared catalysts using three kinds of precipitants: urea, ammonia (NH3Â·H2O), and NaOH. The conversion of 1,4â€�butanediol (94%, 8 h) was the highest using NaOH as a precipitant (Table 2), because this catalyst contained the smallest Au particles. Meanwhile, the catalyst obtained using urea showed the highest selectivity (68%, 8 h). This is because the thermal decomposition of urea allowed the pH of the soluâ€� tion to be maintained throughout the whole deposition process, which could facilitate homogeneous precipitation of gold [36]. Because formation of [Au(NH3)4] 3+ would induce the loss of Au, the catalyst produced using NH3Â·H2O exhibited poor conversion of 1,4â€�butanediol and selectivity for ï�§â€�butyrolactone of 23% and 0.1%, respectively. It has been reported that not all gold is used in DP with NaOH [37], but using urea can avoid this probâ€� lem. Therefore, we chose urea as the precipitant in this study. The desired Au/SnO2 catalysts were obtained by accurately controlling the concentration of urea during DP. 3.2.3. Effect of calcination temperature Calcination of the catalyst plays an essential role in transâ€� Table 1 Physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of Au/SnO2.

LI Xian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 1013â€“1019 forming ionic gold species into Au NPs, affecting both Au partiâ€� cle size and reaction activity [38]. The performance of catalysts exposed to various calcination temperatures was examined. TEM images in Fig. 2 show that different calcination temperaâ€� tures gave rise to different Au particle sizes. The catalyst calâ€� cined at 573 K contained the smallest average Au particles of 3.9 nm with the narrowest size distribution. With increased temperature (773 K), the size of the gold particles increased to 21.3 nm because of the aggregation of Au NPs. The sample calâ€� cined at 473 K showed an average particle size of 5.2 nm, which was larger than that calcined at 573 K, possibly because of a large proportion of gold remaining as ionic species, as demonâ€� strated by the subsequent XPS characterization. The XPS results in Table 1 reveal the surface gold (Au surf) content exceeded that of the bulk, indicating that Au was mainâ€� ly loaded on the surface of the support by DP with urea. As the calcination temperature increased, the amount of Au surf deâ€� creased because more Au surf entered the bulk of SnO2. The Au 4f XPS peaks were quite asymmetric, demonstrating that there were both metallic (binding energy (BE) = 83.0 eV) and ionic (BE = 82.2 eV) gold species present. The BE of metallic gold (Au 0 ) was lower than that of the bulk gold at 84.0 eV, suggestâ€� ing a strong metalâ€�support interaction formed [30,32]. Accordâ€� ing to the deconvolution of Au 4f peaks, more than half of Au surf was metallic and the rest was in the Î´ â€“ state. The anionic gold (Au Î´â€“ ) formed by electrons from SnO2 shifting into Au NPs furâ€� ther indicates the strong interaction between Au and the SnO2 support. The catalysts calcined at 473 and 573 K contained the most Au Î´â€“ species (45% and 46% for 473 and 573 K) of the samples, indicating they possessed the strongest interactions between Au and SnO2. As the calcination temperature inâ€� creased, the amount of Au Î´â€“ reduced as more Au Î´â€“ species was transformed into Au 0 . The content of Au 0 was further conâ€� firmed by observing the colors of the samples. The fresh cataâ€� lyst before drying and calcination was light yellow, indicating the presence of a large proportion of Au Î´â€“ . After being dried at 373 K, the surface of catalyst began to turn to purple, and the color deepened as the calcination temperature was increased. 3.2.4. Effect of gold loading Adjusting Au loading directly influences catalytic properties, so the dependence of activity on Au loading was also studied. The results of ICPâ€�AES analysis presented in Table 1 show that the actual gold loadings of various catalysts were all near the nominal amount. TEM images in Fig. 3 reveal the average Au particle size in the catalyst with 3% loading was the smallest at 3.9 nm. When the gold loading was increased, the size of the Au NPs increased because of readily aggregated on the surface of the support whose BET surface area is low. The average Au particle size of 4.3 nm in the catalyst with 1% loading was larger than that with 3% loading, maybe because a large proâ€� portion of gold was present as ionic species as detected by XPS, similar to the catalyst calcined at 473 K. For the catalyst with 8% loading of Au, the average Au particle size was 6.3 nm, which was much larger than those of the other catalysts. This is because the low BET surface area of SnO2 could not accommoâ€� date all of the Au NPs, causing them to agglomerate. XPS results also revealed that the Au surf content increased with Au loading (Table 1). However, Au surf in the catalyst with 8% loading was less than that with 5% loading, indicating that more surface gold entered the bulk SnO2 in the catalyst with 24681012 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 4.3 ï‚± 1.2 nm P a r t i c l e n u m b e r s (b) 24681012 0 50 100 150 200 3.9 ï‚± 1.2 nm P a r t i c l e n u m b e r s (d) 24681012 0 40 80 120 160 200 4.5 ï‚± 1.3 nm P a r t i c l e n u m b e r s (f) 24681012 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Particle size (nm) Particle size (nm) Particle size (nm) 6.3 ï‚± 2.4 nm Particle size (nm) P a r t i c l e n u m b e r s (h) (a) (c) (e) (g) Â Fig. 3.

This was a result of the low BET surface area of SnO2, which led to saturation of Au surf when the Au loading reached 5%. Moreover, the BE of Sn 3d5/2 in Au/SnO2 was 488.0 eV, which was higher than that of pristine SnO2 (486.4 eV). This finding implies that electrons were transferred from the SnO2 support to surface gold particles, further indicating the forâ€� mation of strong interactions between Au and SnO2 [39]. 3.3. Catalytic oxidative lactonization of 1,4â€�butanediol 3.3.1. Effect of calcination temperature The performance of the catalysts in the oxidative lactonizaâ€� tion of 1,4â€�butanediol was examined at 413 K, and the results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. The Au/SnO2 catalyst calcined at 573 K showed the highest activity with a conversion of 94% of 8 h because it contained the most dispersed gold particles. The reaction rates of catalysts calcined at 473 and 573 K were 31.3 and 33.3 mol/(molÂ·h), respectively, which were faster than those calcined at higher temperatures because they conâ€� tained smaller gold particles. In addition, the rate of conversion decreased after 1 h for the sample calcined at 473 K, and the final conversion was relatively low (40% after 8 h). Meanwhile, the catalyst calcined at 773 K was inferior to the others because of the intrinsic agglomeration of Au, which led to it containing the largest gold particles. The catalysts containing more Au Î´â€“ exhibited higher catalytic performance, so we propose that Au Î´â€“ species contribute to the high activity. As a result, the deâ€� creased conversion of the catalyst calcined at 473 K could be ascribed to the transformation of Au Î´â€“ to Au 0 during the cataâ€� lytic reaction. 3.3.2. Effect of gold loading The catalytic activities of Au/SnO2 catalysts with various gold loadings are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5. The catalyst with 3% loading exhibited the highest conversion of 94%, while that with 5% loading had the highest selectivity of 83%. Catalysts with 1% and 3% loading exhibited similar reaction rates (36.3 and 33.3 mol/(molÂ·h) for 1% and 3%, respectively), which were higher than those of 21.5 and 8.0 mol/(molÂ·h) for cataâ€� lysts with a loading of 5% and 8%, respectively, because they contained smaller gold particles. The catalyst with 1% loading exhibited the worst performance, with a conversion of 55% after 14 h. Such low Au loading did not afford enough active sites, demonstrating that the gold particle size was not the deâ€� cisive factor influencing catalytic activity. The conversion by catalysts with 3% and 5% loading were alike at the beginning of the reaction, but after 2 h, the conversion decreased for the catalyst with 5% loading because of agglomeration of Au NPs. 3.3.3. Durability of Au/SnO2 catalyst The recyclability of the Au/SnO2 catalyst with 3% gold loading that was calcined at 573 K was examined. As shown in Table 3, the activity of catalyst decreased with conversion deâ€� creasing from 100% to 80% and selectivity falling from 68% to 30% after 3 uses. The used catalyst was characterized to deâ€� termine the reason for deactivation. We performed a leaching test using ICPâ€�AES, but no leaching of Au or Sn was detected in the reaction mixture. However, gold particle size increased from 3.9 to 8.6 nm after being used according to TEM images (Fig. 6), which explains the deactivation of the catalyst. Compoâ€� site supports have been reported to improve the durability and stability of gold against sintering [40], and the relatively large BET surface area of such supports may prevent Au NPs from agglomerating. This may be a feasible way to improve the cataâ€� 0 20 40 60 80 100 02468 0 20 40 60 80 100 573 K 473 K C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) 773 K 673 K (a) 573 K 473 K (b) S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Reaction time (h) 773 K 673 K Fig. 4.

Effect of multiple parameters To eliminate the influence from the surrounding environâ€� ment on the catalyst before the catalytic experiment, we tested the performance of catalysts that were preprocessed by drying under vacuum or in oxygen. No difference was observed in the performance of catalysts that were pretreated or not. Comâ€� bined the above results, the high activity of Au/SnO2 was caused by the small mean gold particle size and appropriate Au loading, along with the suitable ratio of Au 0 and Au Î´â€“ species. The highest activity was obtained for the catalyst with 3% gold loading that was calcined at 573 K, which was a result of the low BET surface area of the support and the appropriate ratio of gold species coming from the moderate interaction between Au and the support. We calculated the turnover frequency (TOF) value of the reaction from the first 1 h. To our surprise, the TOF value is 974 h â€“1 , much larger than that of an Au/TiO2 catalyst (64 h â€“1 , 3% Au loading, calcined at 573 K) under idenâ€� tical reaction conditions [32]. SnO2 and TiO2 both are nâ€�type semiconductors, and possess similar physicochemical properâ€� ties and applications [22,41], but Au/SnO2 exhibited higher activity than Au/TiO2 in this reaction. This difference is probaâ€� bly because gold generates an important surface state band on the valence band edge of SnO2 and crystallographic distortion localized at the grain surface, which can enhance the catalytic performance at the active sites [42â€“46]. This finding has not been reported for Au/TiO2. In addition, the gold is predomiâ€� nantly present in the form of Au Î´â€“ in our samples, but it is mainly Au Î´+ in Au/TiO2 [32]. We believe that Au Î´â€“ facilitates the oxidative reaction of diols, so Au Î´â€“ also increases activity. Moreover, some reports indicated that Au Î´+ could be photoreâ€� duced by natural light [33â€“35,47], so our catalysts avoid this shortcoming. Unlike TiO2, SnO2 has rarely been applied in gold catalysts, but according to the present study, SnO2 is a promisâ€� ing candidate as a support for gold catalysts. We hope Au/SnO2 will receive more attention as a catalyst. 4. Conclusions Highly efficient Au/SnO2 catalysts were prepared by DP and used for the oxidation of 1,4â€�butanediol to ï�§â€�butyrolactone. The highest catalytic activity was obtained on the catalyst with 3% gold loading that was calcined at 573 K, and was prepared at pH = 8.0 using urea as the precipitant. This catalyst exhibited a TOF value 15 times higher than that of Au/TiO2. The higher activity can be ascribed to the small gold particles and the strong metalâ€�support interaction that induced a suitable ratio of Au 0 and Au Î´â€“ species by adjusting calcination temperature and gold loading. Our results show that ureaâ€�DP is an effective method to prepare Au/SnO2 catalysts that could be used in a wide range of oxidation reactions. However, the stability and selectivity of this catalyst for oxidizing diols are still not very good, and the selectivity fluctuates during the reaction. We intend to improve the performance of these catalysts in the future. References [1] Zielasek V, Jurgens B, Schulz C, Biener J, Biener M M, Hamza A V, Baumer M.

Tel: +86-21-55664678; Fax: +86-21-55665701 A series of gold catalysts supported on commercial SnO2 were synthesized by deposition-precipitation while accurately controlling pH and precipitant species. The supported catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Gold loading and calcination temperature both affected the dispersion and nature of gold species on SnO2. The performance of the catalysts in the oxidative lactonization of 1,4-butanediol to γ-butyrolactone was investigated. The catalyst with 3% gold that was calcined at 573 K exhibited the highest activity, which was 15 times higher than that of Au/TiO2. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the high dispersion of gold particles and adequate Au0 and Auδ− species formed because of the strong interaction between Au and SnO2 and the intrinsic properties of SnO2. 摘要 采用沉积沉淀法制备了一系列商业SnO2负载的纳米Au催化剂, 通过电感耦合等离子体发射光谱、X射线粉末衍射、透射电镜和X射线光电子能谱等方法研究了溶液酸碱性、沉淀剂种类、Au负载量和焙烧温度等对催化剂性质的影响. 结果表明, Au的负载量以及催化剂的焙烧温度对Au颗粒状态有较大影响. 其中, 于573 K焙烧的3%Au/SnO2催化剂在1,4-丁二醇氧化制备γ-丁内酯反应中的催化活性最好, TOF值是Au/TiO2催化剂的15倍. 这主要是由于SnO2载体独特的性质对所负载的Au颗粒的影响.
