Herein, we perform systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic simulations to shed light on the activity and selectivity trends of ethanol relative to three competing by-products in syngas conversion, which quantitatively unveils the key determining factors on the transition metal-based catalysts. The scaling relations involved are revealed as functions of the adsorption energies of C and O species (E C and E O), and the three-dimensional activity and selectivity surfaces are constructed quantitatively, indicating that the optimal condition (peak position) correspond to E C = -6.10 eV and E O = -5.70 eV. Furthermore, we find that ethanol activity at the peak is primarily constrained by the kinetic barriers of CH3O dissociation and the coupling reaction of CH3 and CO, while its selectivity can be enhanced by increasing the energy barrier of CH3 hydrogenation and strengthening the adsorption of CH3CHO. More significantly, following these rules, the single-atom metal alloy catalysts (i.e., Cu1Co, Cu1Ni) are identified that could serve as promising candidates for ethanol synthesis, which are superior to the common alloy-type catalysts. We believe that these insights further deepen the understanding of theoretical design of metal alloy catalysts in ethanol production.

It can be derived from multiple sources including sugar fermentation, petroleum refining, or the conversion of syngas (CO/H2). Among these methods, syngas conversion to ethanol presents a promising avenue for harnessing coal, natural gas, and biomass resources, facilitating the production of valuable chemicals and environmentally friendly liquid transportation fuels [1-5]. However, the catalytic process encounters significant challenges, characterized primarily by low yields and insufficient selectivity in ethanol production [6-8]. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the underlying factors influencing ethanol selectivity to enable the design and optimization of catalysts for highly selective syngas-to-ethanol conversion. Despite considerable efforts in recent decades to determine the decisive factors affecting the ethanol selectivity, it is still under debate due to the competitive reaction channels with several major by-products (methane, methanol, acetaldehyde) [9-15]. For example, the formation of methanol requires the hydrogenation of non-dissociated CO, whereas the CO bond cleavage of CHxO is required for the formation of methane and C2 products (ethanol, acetaldehyde) [16-20]. This suggests that CHxO plays a critical role in product selectivity. In addition, the CHx is also considered to be the key intermediate to ethanol synthesis due to its different conversion pathways, i.e., its hydrogenation or coupling with CO [21-24]. In addition, current research is mainly focused on elucidating the activity and selectivity of ethanol synthesis on the individual transition metal (TM) catalyst (i.e., Rh, Cu, Co, etc.), failing to comprehend the overall activity and selectivity trends of different TM catalysts, let alone guide the rational optimization of highly selective ethanol synthesis catalysts. Overall, the following pivotal questions remain to be addressed. First, what is the rate-limiting step for the selective conversion of syngas to ethanol on different TMs? Second, are there any descriptors that can express the overall activity and selectivity? If so, how can we break the constraint relations between the activity and the descriptors to further improve the catalytic efficiency? Obtaining this information will be crucial for optimizing the catalytic performance of ethanol synthesis, which also provides the opportunity to screen for green and sustainable catalysts for industrial applications. Herein, we carried out systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic simulations to shed light on the activity and selectivity trends of ethanol in various competitive by-products from syngas conversion on a series of TM catalysts and their determining factors. Two key adsorption energy-based descriptors were identified from a large number of linear relationships, which gives the requirements for optimal activity and selectivity of ethanol. This allowed us to predict several potential alloy catalysts, which were confirmed by calculating the energy barriers of four rate-limiting steps sensitive to ethanol activity and selectivity. These computational results also explain the widespread use of Cu or Rh-based catalysts in ethanol synthesis and may provide the guidance on how to overcome their limited activity and selectivity. 2 Computational methods All the spin-polarized calculations were performed by DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [25], using the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [26]. The valence electronic states were expanded in plane-wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 450 eV. The Broyden method was employed for geometry relaxation until the maximum force on each relaxed atom was less than 0.05 eV/Å. The adsorption and transition-state energies were calculated using a four-layer slab model with the bottom two layers fixed. The vacuum (in z axis) between slabs was 15 Å and the (111) surface was modeled using a supercell of p(3 × 3) (Figure S1). A Monkhorst-Pack grid of 3 × 3 × 1 k-points was used for all DFT calculations [27]. All the transition states were searched by a constrained optimization scheme [28,29] and were verified when (i) all forces on atoms vanish, and (ii) the total energy is a maximum along the reaction coordination but a minimum with respect to the rest of the degrees of freedom. The force threshold for the transition state search is 0.05 eV/Å. The adsorption energy of species X, Eads(X), was calculated by Eads(X) = EX/surf – Esurf – EX , where EX/surf and Esurf are the total energies of the optimized catalyst surface with and without X adsorbed on the surface, respectively, and EX is the energy of species X in the gas phase. Thus, a more negative Eads (X) value indicates a stronger adsorption of species X on the surface. Notably, the microkinetic simulation was carried out using the CATKINAS package [30,31],in which the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of each elementary step were corrected with the entropy effects (TΔS) considered, according to ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. The selectivity of the target product is defined as its formation rate divided by the overall formation rate of all products. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 BrØnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations and linear relationships As reported in previous studies [32-34], the widely accepted reaction mechanisms for the selective conversion of syngas to ethanol and other by-products are shown in Scheme 1. More details on the mechanisms of ethanol synthesis can be found in Scheme S1 [32] and Table S2 in the Supporting Information, verifying the applicability of the reaction pathway in Scheme 1 . It can be described by the following four interconnected subprocesses: (i) The reactive H continuously attacks the C-end in CO to form CH3O species; (ii) CH3O can undergo hydrogenation to give methanol, or alternatively it could dissociate to form the CH3 intermediate responsible for the formation of other products; (iii) CH3 can either be hydrogenated into methane or couple with CO to produce CH3CO species; (iv) Ethanol and acetaldehyde can be produced via H attacking the O or C ends of the CH3CO intermediate, respectively. Obviously, these processes capture the key reaction steps that affect the selectivity between different products, such as the dissociation of CH3O and the coupling of CH3 and CO. The enthalpy changes (∆H) and the energy barriers (E a) of all the elementary steps mentioned above on the (111) surface of 7 TMs (TM = Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, Ag) were first calculated (Table S1), and the BEP relations of some key reaction steps and the structures of the intermediate species are shown in Fig. 1 and Figure S2, respectively. It can be clearly seen that ∆H and E a follow a good linear relationship, which provides a basis for accurately constructing the activity and selectivity trends of the products. More importantly, some general insights can be found: (i) Compared with the dissociation of CH3O, its hydrogenation exhibits the lower energy barriers on almost all TMs (Fig. 1a), implying that methanol synthesis may be kinetically more favorable than other products, and this result is in agreement with literature work [15]. (ii) The energy barriers of CH3* coupling with CO* on TMs are always higher than those of its hydrogenation steps via CH3* + H* ↔ CH4* + * (Fig. 1b), indicating that methane selectivity may be preferred to C2 species (CH3CH2OH and CH3CHO). (iii) H preferentially attacks the O-end in CH3CO to form ethanol on TMs (TM = Pt, Au, Rh, Pd), while attacking the C-end on the remaining three TMs to form acetaldehyde (Fig. 1c). (iv) The elementary reaction step involving bond cleavage can more easily occur on the reactive TMs (i.e., Ru, Rh, Pd) due to the lower energy barriers, such as the dissociation of CH3O species, whereas the remaining reaction steps involving bond formation tend to occur on the inert TMs (i.e., Cu, Ag, Au) (Fig. 1a). These results also suggest the difficulty in achieving the high selectivity of ethanol on pure TMs, and therefore how to combine the properties of different TMs to enhance its activity and selectivity deserves further investigation. The adsorption energies of all the intermediates involved on different TMs were calculated to identify the activity and selectivity descriptors of the products in syngas conversion (Table S3). By analyzing the linear relationships between their adsorption energies, it was found that the C and O species can classify all the intermediates into two categories, showing a better correlation coefficient (R 2) than the use of CO and OH species as descriptors in the literature (Table S4,S5 and Figure S3). More importantly, the greater sensitivity of the adsorption energy of C and O (E C and E O) on different TMs can cover a range of adsorption energy changes, increasing the possibility of screening for efficient catalysts of ethanol synthesis. 3.2 Microkinetic analyses 3.2.1 Activity and selectivity trends Under typical experimental conditions [35-37]: T = 593 K and P = 20 bar, P CO:P H2 = 1:2, Vgt = 20 cm3/min (space velocity), systematic microkinetic analyses were performed to quantitatively understand the activity and selectivity trends of four products (CH3CH2OH, CH3OH, CH4 and CH3CO). Using the BEP relations and linear relationships obtained above, the three-dimensional volcano-type surfaces as a function of E C and E O for methane, methanol, acetaldehyde, and ethanol formation are plotted in Fig. 2 . Note that we have compared the turnover frequencies (TOF) of ethanol formation estimated from the BEP relations and linear relations with those calculated directly from DFT energetics (Table S6 and Figure S5) and found a small difference between them, indicating that the TOF estimated from the relations can almost completely describe the activity trends of the complex ethanol synthesis on the TMs. It can be observed from Fig. 2 that the formation of methane and methanol exhibits higher activity than that of acetaldehyde and ethanol in most areas of the surface. This indicates that ethanol is indeed not easily generated on TM catalysts, which is consistent with many experimental results [38,39]. The main reason is that ethanol synthesis involves competing reaction steps to produce methane and methanol; in particular, the CO bond cleavage of CH3O and the CC bond coupling for CH3CO formation require extremely high energy barriers (Fig. 1a,b). Furthermore, we found that the peaks of four volcano surfaces are very close to each other, which explains to some extent the difficulty in screening highly active catalysts for ethanol production. Among the seven TMs calculated above, Cu, Rh and Ru are the only three TMs near the peak of the volcano surface for ethanol production (Fig. 2d), providing the possibility of being optimized to its peak by alloying. Furthermore, we calculated the selectivity of four products based on the activity maps described above. As shown in Fig. 3 , the selectivity towards the formation of methane (a), methanol (b), acetaldehyde (c), and ethanol (d) from syngas is constructed, respectively. It shows that, with the exception of Rh and Ru, the other five TMs exhibit notably high selectivity towards methanol. More interestingly, we observed that the methanol selectivity is mainly controlled by E O, i.e., the weaker E O (E O ≥ −5.5 eV) helps to improve the methanol selectivity (Fig. 3b). This is easy to understand because E O correlates well with E CH3O on TMs (Figure S3), the weaker E CH3O prefers hydrogenation rather than dissociation. Instead, under the condition of E O ≤ −5.5 eV, CH3O* tends to dissociate into CH3* and O* and then undergoes hydrogenation or CC coupling according to the criteria of E C ≈ −6.0 eV. Since the slope of the linear relationship between E CO and E C is greater than that between E H and E C (0.51 > 0.20 in Figure S3), the weaker E C (E C ≥ −6.0 eV) implies that E H is stronger than E CO on the catalyst surface, thereby promoting CH3* hydrogenation and leading to the high methane selectivity (Fig. 3a). In comparison, the coupling of CH3* with CO* requires E C ≤ −6.0 eV, which is conducive to the formation of acetaldehyde or ethanol (Fig. 3c,d). Compared to the lower left region for high acetaldehyde selectivity (Fig. 3c), ethanol can only exhibit the high selectivity within a localized region, which requires the moderate adsorption energies for C and O species due to the higher sensitivity between E CH3COH/E CH3CHOH and E C/E O (Figure S3), and their optimal energies satisfy E C = −6.10 eV and E O = −5.70 eV (Fig. 3d). This explains why it is difficult to find highly selective catalysts for ethanol synthesis. 3.2.2 Determining factors for ethanol selectivity Further, the origin of the influence on ethanol activity and selectivity was investigated in order to guide the optimization of catalysts. As shown in Table 1 , the degree of rate control (XRC,i ) [40] of each elementary reaction step was calculated at the summit of the volcano surface of ethanol synthesis (E C = −6.10 eV and E O = −5.70 eV in Fig. 3d). The higher the absolute value of XRC,i , the more sensitive the effect of the energy barrier of elementary step i on the ethanol activity and selectivity; the positive and negative signs of XRC,i indicate opposite influences. For example, steps R8 (CH3O* + * ↔ CH3* + O*) and R10 (CH3* + CO* ↔ CH3CO* + *) show the relatively larger XRC,i value of 0.61 and 0.63, respectively, suggesting that lowering their barriers is beneficial for increasing the ethanol activity. We can also see that steps R9 (CH3* + H* ↔ CH4(g) + 2*) and R12 (CH3CHO* ↔ CH3CHO(g) + *) separately show the negative XRC,i values of −0.67 and −0.85, indicating that the selectivity of ethanol can be improved by increasing the barriers of these two steps. These results can be briefly understood as follows, based on the reaction mechanism of syngas conversion to ethanol (Scheme 1). As the key reaction steps in ethanol formation, the lower kinetic barriers for R8 and R10 are a prerequisite for the high activity. In contrast, suppressing the formation of CH4 and CH3CHO by increasing their corresponding barriers (R9 and R12) can most sensitively increase the ethanol selectivity, while methanol formation behaves with a relatively small effect on the ethanol selectivity due to the smaller absolute XRC,i value (−0.16 for R6 in Table 1). From a thermodynamic point of view, the coverages (θi ) of the surface intermediates involved in the reaction mechanisms were also analyzed in order to understand how each surface species affects the reaction activity and selectivity. As can be seen from Table 2 , the catalyst surface is occupied by CO* and H* species (θ CO* = 3.87×10−1, θ H* = 1.19×10−1), while θ CH3O* and θ CH3* involved in the key determining steps (R8 and R10) are the relatively low (1.26×10−5 and 2.90×10−3, respectively). As a result, the efficient dissociation of CH3O* and the CC bond coupling of CH3* with CO* are inhibited due to the lower adsorption energies of CH3O* and CH3*. Therefore, such an excess of these two species (CO* and H*) on the surface could be considered as the main reason for limiting the catalytic activity of ethanol production, deviating from the expected one for the optimum catalyst. As is well known, the surface coverage of intermediate species is determined by their corresponding adsorption energy. Thus, by selectively modifying the catalysts to weaken the adsorption energies of CO* and H* species and strengthen the adsorption energies of CH3O* and CH3* species, the surface coverage of key reactive species (θ CH3O* and θ CH3*) can be increased, and accordingly, the activity of ethanol synthesis from syngas can be effectively improved. Moreover, based on the summit of the volcano surface of ethanol synthesis (E C = −6.10 eV and E O = −5.70 eV in Fig. 3d) and the linear relationships between the adsorption energies of the intermediates (Figure S3), we also calculated that the optimal adsorption energies of CH3O* and CH3* species are −2.44 eV and −2.01 eV, respectively. This result can provide a guideline for rapid screening of ethanol-producing catalysts. 3.3 Rational design for high selective ethanol synthesis catalysts The above microkinetic analyses have discussed the requirements for the optimal catalyst and its optimization in syngas conversion to ethanol. Perhaps more importantly, how can we apply these theoretical rules to screen for highly activity and selectivity catalysts for ethanol production? Here, using the corresponding optimal E C and E O as the descriptors, we first calculated the E C and E O over other TMs (i.e., Co, Ir, Ni) and found that Co and Ni are close to the summit of the volcano surface for ethanol formation in contrast to the original Cu, Ru and Rh (Fig. 4a ,b). It is known that a well-tested method for tuning the activity and selectivity of TM catalysts is to modify their electronic structure by forming alloys. Therefore, five potential TMs (Cu, Rh, Ru, Co, Ni) were selected to form alloys. Notably, two common alloy-typed catalysts were designed (Scheme 2 ); one is the AB type catalyst, where two TMs are uniformly mixed and the other is the single-atom alloy (denoted as A1B type). From Fig. 4a,b and Table S7, it can be seen that the A1B alloy-typed catalysts are closer to the peak of the volcano surface of ethanol synthesis compared to AB type catalysts, with Cu1Co being the closest to the peak. Interestingly, these single-atom alloys deviate more from the constraint relationship between E C and E O on pure TMs, indicating their greater potential to break the traditional linear relationships and then improve the activity and selectivity of ethanol synthesis. To further confirm the superiority of the Cu1Co alloy, we calculated the ∆H and the E a of some key reaction steps (R6, R8, R9, R10, R12) that affect the activity and selectivity of ethanol production on the Cu1Co. As shown in Fig. 4c,d and Table S8, we found that the effective energy barrier for CH3O dissociation and subsequent coupling with CO (R8 and R10) decreased significantly to 1.35 eV compared to 1.85 eV on pure Cu (Fig. 4c), indicating the kinetic enhancement of the activity in ethanol formation. Meanwhile, the increase in E a for steps R6, R9 and R12 suggests an inhibitory effect on the formation of by-products (CH4, CH3OH, CH3CHO), i.e., ethanol selectivity is improved (Fig. 4d). Overall, these calculations confirm that Cu1Co is beneficial for improving the activity and selectivity of ethanol, explaining the reason for choosing Cu and Co as the alloy in the experiment [41-43]. Similarly, another A1B alloy-typed catalyst (Cu1Ni) has also been verified to exhibit good selectivity of ethanol (Fig. 4b), as detailed in Table S9. 4 Conclusions In summary, we systematically investigated the activity and selectivity of ethanol synthesis from syngas conversion on TMs(111) surfaces, covering the formation of the common by-products (methane, methanol, and acetaldehyde), using the DFT calculations and microkinetic analysis. Two key descriptors (E C and E O) have been identified to provide insight into the activity and selectivity trends of ethanol production with the help of the obtained BEP relations and liner adsorption energy relationships, which predict that the optimum catalyst should satisfy the condition of E C = −6.10 eV and E O = −5.70 eV. It was further found that the energy barriers of CH3O* dissociation and the coupling of CH3* and CO* significantly affect the activity of ethanol formation, while increasing the energy barrier of CH3* hydrogenation and enhancing the CH3CHO* adsorption can improve the selectivity of ethanol. These theoretical results allow us to predict the potential alloy catalysts, such as Cu1Co and Cu1Ni, and they have been shown to have excellent activity and selectivity for ethanol. We believe that these rules would enhance our ability in screening new ethanol-producing catalysts for practical applications.

        "dc:description": "Achieving high selectivity in converting syngas to ethanol has long been a challenging task, requiring identification of key factors favoring ethanol production over other by-products such as methane, methanol, and acetaldehyde. Herein, we perform systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic simulations to shed light on the activity and selectivity trends of ethanol relative to three competing by-products in syngas conversion, which quantitatively unveils the key determining factors on the transition metal-based catalysts. The scaling relations involved are revealed as functions of the adsorption energies of C and O species (E C and E O), and the three-dimensional activity and selectivity surfaces are constructed quantitatively, indicating that the optimal condition (peak position) correspond to E C = -6.10 eV and E O = -5.70 eV. Furthermore, we find that ethanol activity at the peak is primarily constrained by the kinetic barriers of CH3O dissociation and the coupling reaction of CH3 and CO, while its selectivity can be enhanced by increasing the energy barrier of CH3 hydrogenation and strengthening the adsorption of CH3CHO. More significantly, following these rules, the single-atom metal alloy catalysts (i.e., Cu1Co, Cu1Ni) are identified that could serve as promising candidates for ethanol synthesis, which are superior to the common alloy-type catalysts. We believe that these insights further deepen the understanding of theoretical design of metal alloy catalysts in ethanol production.",
