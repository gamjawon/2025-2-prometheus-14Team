Feo di Vito, I-89060 Reggio Calabria, Italy * Corresponding author. Tel.: +39-0965-875256; fax: +39-0965-875201. Hydrogenation and isomerization of α,β-unsaturated alcohols have been investigated in tetrahydrofuran over Pd/TiO2 catalysts at 303K and 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure. The double bond isomerization reaction of these substrates affords also the corresponding saturated aldehydes or ketones. Catalytic activity and selectivity depend strongly on the steric and electronic effects characteristic of the organic substrate. A mechanism involving two σ-alkyl palladium bonded intermediates was proposed. Liquid phase hydrogenation and isomerization of some α,β-unsaturated primary and secondary alcohols have been investigated in tetrahydrofuran over a 2.5% TiO2 supported palladium catalyst at 303K and 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure. The double bond isomerization reaction of these substrates leads also to formation of the corresponding saturated aldehydes or ketones. Catalytic activity and selectivity were found to depend strongly on the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on the double bond of the alcohol. The less crowded is the olefinic bond of the unsaturated alcohol, the higher is the activity. Formation of two σ-alkyl palladium bonded intermediates was postulated to explain the different selectivity towards hydrogenated and isomerized products observed for α,β-unsaturated alcohols used. 2-Propen-1-ol exhibited the highest activity and selectivity for double bond migration leading to propanal up to 80% yield. Keywords α,β-Unsaturated alcohols Hydrogenation Double bond isomerization TiO2 supported palladium catalyst σ-Alkyl intermediates 1 Introduction The catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes to the saturated analogous is frequently accompanied by double bond migration and/or cis–trans isomerization [1–3]. In particular, in the case of α,β-unsaturated alcohols, the double bond isomerization reaction can afford the corresponding saturated aldehydes or ketones through the following sequence: The extent of formation of these products depends on the catalyst used as well as the reaction conditions. Therefore, an important challenge is to obtain the carbonyl derivative with high selectivity. It is also well known that supported palladium catalysts are both the most active and selective for hydrogenation and isomerization reactions of alkenes [4–6]. In previous papers we have presented the results on the liquid phase hydrogenation of an α,β-unsaturated diol, cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, over supported palladium catalysts. It was observed that, under the experimental conditions adopted, the cis-2-butene-1,4-diol is hydrogenated to butane-1,4-diol through a complex reaction network, involving also double bond and cis–trans isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions [7,8]. The study of the effect of some parameters, such as the nature of the support and the solvent and the partial hydrogen pressure, highlighted that high yield to double bond migration products can be obtained using TiO2 as material support, aprotic solvents (tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate) and low partial hydrogen pressure. In this work a systematic study on the catalytic hydrogenation and isomerization of a series of α,β-unsaturated alcohols, such as 2-propen-1-ol (A2), (E)-2-buten-1-ol (tB2), 3-buten-2-ol (B3), (E)-2-penten-1-ol (tP2), (Z)-2-penten-1-ol (cP2), (E)-3-penten-2-ol (tP3), (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (tH2), carried out at low partial hydrogen pressure and over a Pd/TiO2 catalyst, is reported in order to verify the possibility of a new synthetic route to carbonyl derivatives. The influence of the organic substrate structure on the activity and products distribution was also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The compounds studied, 2-propen-1-ol (A2), (E)-2-buten-1-ol (tB2), 3-buten-2-ol (B3), (E)-2-penten-1-ol (tP2), (Z)-2-penten-1-ol (cP2), (E)-3-penten-2-ol (tP3), (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (tH2), were commercial products, purchased from Aldrich. Distilled tetrahydrofuran (Fluka, 99.8% analytical grade) and ultra high purity hydrogen (multigas>99.9%) were used. The support used for the catalyst preparation was a commercial TiO2 (anatase phase) of low surface area (SA=8.6m2/g), supplied by Fluka. Palladium catalyst (2.5%) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the support with an acidic aqueous solution of PdCl2 in HCl 0.1M. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 393K for 2h and reduced at 423K for 1h under flowing hydrogen. 2.2 Reaction procedure The hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols was carried out in liquid phase at 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure and 303K, using tetrahydrofuran as solvent in a five-necked flask of 100ml, equipped with a reflux condenser and a thermocouple. Nitrogen was used to balance the total reaction pressure at 0.1MPa. The reaction temperature was maintained at the constant value (±0.5°C) by circulation of silicone oil in an external jacket connected with a thermostat. The catalyst was added to the solvent used (25ml) and reduced in situ at 323K for 1h under H2 flow. After cooling at the desired reaction temperature, 15ml of a 0.6M solution of the α,β-unsaturated alcohol in tetrahydrofuran, containing an internal standard, was added through one arm of the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred with a stirrer head having a permanent magnetic coupling at a stirring rate of 500rpm. The progress of the reaction was followed by analyzing a sufficient number of samples withdrawn from the reaction mixture. Products analysis was performed with a gas chromatograph (HP model 5890) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The products separation was obtained using a wide-bore capillary column (CP Wax 52 CB, 30m, i.d.=0.53mm). Quantitative analyses were carried out by calculating the area of the chromatographic peaks with an electronic integrator (HP model 3395). 3 Results and discussion Reactions of α,β-unsaturated alcohols were carried out over titania supported palladium, at 303K and 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure, using tetrahydrofuran as solvent, in order to favor the isomerization versus the hydrogenation process [8,9]. All experimental results concerning the activity and the products distribution are reported in Table 1 . Under the experimental conditions used, the reaction proceeds according to Scheme 1 . Hydrogenation of the starting compound (supposed to be a trans-derivative) gives the fully hydrogenated product (b). On the other hand double bond isomerization from 2 to 1 position affords the aldehyde (d), through a vinyl alcohol intermediate, whereas the analogous isomerization from 2 to 3 double bond position leads to formation of the trans-olefin derivative (c). This gives (b) as final hydrogenation product. Furthermore, hydrogenolysis of the starting material gives (e) that can be further hydrogenated to the compound (f). An analogous scheme can be formulated for olefinic secondary alcohols. In this case ketones are formed as isomerization final products instead of aldehydes. Subsequent hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of aldehydes or ketones does not occur on palladium catalysts in mild conditions. Furthermore, no isomerization takes place in absence of hydrogen or using only the Lewis acid support. Then hydrogen is necessary for isomerization reactions to proceed on palladium catalysts. A typical products composition–time plot showing the course of the reaction at 303K and 0.01MPa hydrogen pressure for the α,β-unsaturated alcohol, (E)-2-penten-1-ol, is reported in Fig. 1 . Besides final products (pentanal, 1-pentanol and pentane), (E)-3-penten-1-ol, (Z)-3-penten-1-ol and (E)-4-penten-1-ol are the main intermediates detected. They are formed by double bond isomerization from 2 to 3 and from 3 to 4 position, respectively. It should also be noted that double bond migration leads to both geometric isomers of the olefinic alcohol, but the thermodynamically more stable trans-isomer is predominantly formed. Subsequent intermediates hydrogenation affords the saturated alcohol, 1-pentanol. 3.1 Hydrogenation and isomerization of α,β-unsaturated primary alcohols Fig. 2 shows the activities comparison concerning different α,β-unsaturated primary alcohols over the 2.5% Pd/TiO2 used at 303K and 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure. It appears that the activity decreases as the chain length of the organic substrate increases. The highest activity observed, when A2 is used as substrate, is about three times bigger than that obtained with tH2. The results are in agreement with literature data and can be explained taking into account the Lebedev’s rule (the more substituted is the olefinic bond, the slower is the process of hydrogen addition) [10]. Therefore, the steric effect of C sp2 substituents is the most important factor affecting the reactivity of the substrate. Fig. 3 displays the selectivity towards hydrogenation and isomerization products at 80% conversion of the organic substrate. The results indicate that the selectivity towards the saturated aldehydes depends on the substrate structure and it decreases on increasing the chain length of the unsaturated alcohol. Conversely, the opposite double bond migration increases. The best yield to aldehyde, so far obtained, is ∼ 80% when propanal is formed from 2-propen-1-ol. Furthermore, on this substrate, no hydrogenolysis reaction was detected. Moreover, an increase of hydrogenolysis products was observed on other long chain alcohols (Table 1). In a recent paper concerning a detailed kinetic study on the hydrogenation and isomerization of cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, we have shown that formation of hydrogenation and isomerization products can be explained on the basis of an unique σ-alkyl palladium bonded intermediate [8]. Since no reaction occurs in absence of hydrogen, when α,β-unsaturated alcohols are isomerized, formation of a surface palladium hydride species is a fundamental requirement. Therefore the different selectivity towards the corresponding saturated alcohols, aldehydes and other unsaturated compounds deriving from a double bond migration process can be explained on the basis of two σ-alkyl palladium bonded intermediates, formed by an interaction between a chemisorbed unsaturated alcohol and a Pd–H (Scheme 2 ). The proposed formation of two intermediates stems from a hydrogen addition to the 3 carbon atom (intermediate A) and the 2 one (intermediate B) of the associatively adsorbed olefinic substrate. Accordingly, the results obtained indicate that the selectivity towards saturated aldehydes decreases as the C sp2 substituents become larger and it follows the order: CH3CH2CH2≅CH3CH2<CH3<H. Therefore the different stability of both intermediates involved in the process depends strongly on the electronic effects of the substituents: the more important is the electron donor effect of the substituent, the most stable is the intermediate. Propyl, ethyl, methyl group stabilize the intermediate B with respect to the intermediate A. It is also worth noting that no appreciable difference of selectivity was observed between tH2 and tP2, probably because the reactivity differences, due, as previously reported, mainly to electronic effects, reduce as the bulkiness of the groups increases. 3.2 Hydrogenation and isomerization of (Z)-2-penten-1-ol and (E)-2-penten-1-ol Table 1 and Fig. 4 display the results concerning the activity and the selectivity towards the main products observed when the geometric isomers (Z)-2-penten-1-ol and (E)-2-penten-1-ol react with hydrogen. As expected, the (Z) isomer is more reactive than the (E) analogous: its reaction rate, in fact, is about three times higher and takes into account the stronger steric hindrance of the (E) substrate [11]. A different products distribution was also detected. Indeed, when we use cP2, as substrate, a remarkable cis–trans isomerization reaction takes place together with a lower formation of other double bond migration alcoholic olefins. Moreover, no appreciable difference to aldehyde selectivity, pentanal, at 80% conversion of both geometric isomers is observed. As far as the hydrogenolysis product, pentane, is concerned the highest yield occurs starting from tP2. This is quite well understandable on the basis of steric reasons. Furthermore, since the reaction of cP2 and tP2 leads to the same final products, it is suggested that the same σ-alkyl intermediates are also involved (see Scheme 3 ). Therefore, in order to understand the different selectivity data, reported in Fig. 5 , we have to consider that: (i) the (E) derivative is thermodynamically more stable than the (Z) one; (ii) at 80% conversion the selectivity to aldehyde of both cP2 and tP2 are nearly equal. This may imply that, besides the fully hydrogenated compound, the σ-alkyl intermediate C gives, as the only product, the aldehyde derivative, whereas the intermediate D affords other double bond and geometric isomerization products. As a consequence the final yield to aldehyde increases when cP2 is used as starting material. 3.3 Hydrogenation and isomerization of α,β-unsaturated secondary alcohols In order to study the feasibility of saturated ketones from α,β-unsaturated secondary alcohols, 3-buten-2-ol and (E)-3-penten-2-ol were chosen as substrates, following their reaction with hydrogen on Pd/TiO2 at 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure and 303K. Table 1 and Fig. 5 show both activity and selectivity distribution observed. Again, as above reported for analogous unsaturated primary alcohols, these parameters depend on the length of the chain and the mechanism involves two σ-alkyl intermediates as shown in Scheme 4 . In particular the selectivity to ketones increases on changing the C sp2 substituent from CH3 to H and it is higher than that to analogous aldehydes. The best explanation for the observed results considers a greater stability of the σ-alkyl intermediate E (Scheme 4) deriving from a secondary alcohol, due to an additional CH3 on the C bearing the OH group. 4 Conclusions The main results of this work indicate that at 0.01MPa partial hydrogen pressure and over a 2.5% Pd/TiO2 catalyst double bond isomerization and hydrogenolysis products are formed in addition to hydrogenated compounds, starting from α,β-unsaturated alcohols. Aldehydes or ketones are the isomerized final products. The activity and selectivity of the reactions investigated are strongly dependent on the steric and electronic effects of the C sp2 substituents. The more important is the electron donor effect of the substituent, the lower is the formation of aldehydes or ketones. A high yield to aldehyde (∼80%) was obtained starting from 2-propen-1-ol. This result and others experimentally observed make the reaction studied, at least for some unsaturated alcohols, attractive for a new catalytic route leading to carbonyl compounds. References [1] S.
