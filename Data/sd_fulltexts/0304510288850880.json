Surface properties of the different catalysts were examined by chemisorption measurements and through the use of various physical methods. Isomerization of hexene-1 took place in parallel with metathesis, and the resulting internal olefins (hexene-2 and -3) participated actively in the total reaction of hexenes. Consequently, in addition to C^ and C{o, olefins ranging from Cj to C^ were obtained as products, which can be illustrated by the following overall reaction scheme : direct metathesis _ _ |> Cz + CIQ _ double bond isomerization _ C6-1 > Ce-2, Ce-3 __________l______i mixed metathesis Ca\" - Cc\" olefins Catalyst characterization data from HI TPR, 0^ uptake, NHa TPD, XRD, ESR and ESCA measurements have indicated that all of the properties related to the surface state of the Mo oxide, such as the oxidation state and binding energies of Mo cations, the dispersion state, surface acidity etc., are scarcely influenced by the presence of Re cations. There is therefore no obvious interaction between the Re and Mo oxides on the surface. Based on the catalytic behaviour and surface properties of Re-Mo- A12O3 observed in this work, a dual site mechanism was suggested in which the Re and Mo surface species exist independently. The main function of the Re species is to create more metathesis sites, which operate independently, while the isomerization reaction takes place on the acidic sites of the Mo- AlzOa surface. Introduction Olefin metathesis has become a very interesting reaction from the point of view of both industrial application and academic research ever since its 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 120 discovery by Banks in 1964 [1]. It is well known that rhenia, molybdena and tungsten oxide are active catalysts for the reaction. Among these, rhenia is found to be the most active and selective, and tremendous efforts have been made in order to reveal the chemical nature and mechanism of olefin metathesis and to develop new metathesis catalysts with much higher activity and selectivity. Nakamura and Echigoya [2] reported that pretreatment in a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen, carbon monoxide or propene followed by reoxida- tion with 0^ at the reaction temperature can enhance the activity of alumina- supported low-Re207 loading catalysts. Xu Yide et al. [3] found that the enhancement effect of the propene treatment is much more effective if the catalyst is not further reoxidized with 0^. Another approach to improve the activity of the MoOs-A^Oa and W03-Si02 catalysts for olefin metathesis involves the addition of a third component. Nakamura and Echigoya [4] first examined these systems and claimed that the electronegativity of the third component may have some essential role in the enhancement of the activity of the final catalyst. A Russian patent also declared that a few percent of rhenia incorporated into a Mo03-Al203 catalyst can increase the activity [5]. Recently Xu Xiaoding etal. [6] reported that, although olefin metathesis is presumably not defined in terms of an acidic reaction, the promotion effect of the incorporated third component may be attributed to the increased acidity of the catalyst. It should be mentioned that in their studies of the metathesis of functionalized olefins, tetraalkyltin or other organo- metallic compounds are consistently used as cocatalysts. In this work the promotion effect of Re^O^ on the metathesis of hexene-1 with Mo03-Al203 catalysts was investigated by studying the reaction of hexene-1 over Mo03-, Re207- and Mo03-Re207-Al203 catalysts. Experimental Hexene-1, produced by Koch-Light Co. with a purity of 99.0%, was refluxed with CaH2 to further remove trace water and was then stored in a desiccator before use. The catalysts were prepared by impregnating 7-alumina with an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate or perrhenate. Re207-Mo03-AL;03 catalysts were prepared by impregnating the Mo03-Al203 samples of differ- ent Mo03 loadings with an aqueous solution of ammonium perrhenate. The impregnated and dried catalysts were calcined in an air stream at 823 K for 4 h. The physical properties of the catalyst and support are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The metathesis of hexene-1 was studied in a micropulse reactor system equipped with a temperature-programmed gas Chromatograph. A sample of ~150 mg was loaded into the reactor tube. As a standard procedure for catalyst evaluation, the sample was normally treated in situ with an air 121 TABLE 1 Physical properties and impurities analysis of alumina Apparent True Pore Crystal Impurities analysis density density volume phase (gem-3) (gem-3) (gem-3) pb ^ cr Fe cu Mn 0.37 3.36 0.83 T-A^Oa 0.08 0.004 0.001 0.009 0.001 0.000 TABLE 2 Physical properties of the catalysts used in this work Sample Content of active componenta BET surface area Pore volume (wt.%)_______________ (n^g-1) (cnr'g-1) Re207 MoOa A R3A M12A R3M12A 0 3.1 0 3 0 0 13.0 12 229 0.83 209 0.77 208 0.67 185 0.65 ^The nominal content of active components: A = A1203 support; R3A = 3 wt.% Re^O?- Al203;M12A = 13 wt.% Mo03-Al203; R3M12A = 3 wt.% Re207-12 wt.% Mo03-Al203. stream at 823 K for l h and with a N3 stream for l h, before cooling to the reaction temperature of ~473 K. After this catalyst pretreatment, pulses of hexene-1 (1 ^idm3 per pulse) were passed over the catalyst at 473 K using N2 as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 80 cm3 min-1. A fraction of the tail gas was led through a capillary column coated with OV-101, and temperature- programmed for Chromatographie analysis using an FID detector. The Chromatographie separation program was processed and recorded with a CR-1A microprocessor. According to the main features of the metathesis process, the olefin reaction can be generally expressed as follows : (1) Conversion due to the metathesis of hexene-1, M 2(C^ + CJ + C^ + CJ) M = -^ 3 4 5 X 100% 2(Cr + Cj + Ci + CJ ) + C(T (2) Conversion due to double bond isomerization, D C^ -2 + C^ -3 D = = -= - X 100% 2(C^ + Ci- + + C-s) + Co (3) Selectivity for the metathesis of hexene-1, SM M SM = X 100% M+D 122 The product distribution during the metathesis of hexene-1 was expressed as mol%. As demonstrated in our previous work using pulse reaction tests, deactivation of catalysts was found to be appreciable, and therefore com- parisons of catalytic performance in the present work are only possible in terms of the relative magnitude of catalyst activity and/or selectivity. Characterization of the catalyst TPR, 02 uptake, XRD, ESR and ESCA techniques were used to charac- terize the surface and bulk properties of the catalyst. The experimental details are given in a previous work [7]. In order to examine the acidity of the catalyst, NH3 desorption was also studied by a temperature-programmed desorption technique similar to that used in the O; uptake measurements. Results and discussion Catalytic performance of MoOy-Al^O^ and Re^O-y-Al^Os in the metathesis of hexene-1 The results for the reaction of hexene-1 over MoOa-A^Oa with various Mo03 loadings are listed in Table 3. It is shown that the reaction behaviour is insensitive to the MoOa loading in the range from 5 to 26 wt.%. All of the catalysts are highly active with respect to isomerization, but only slightly active for the metathesis of hexene-1 (<10%). Moreover, approximately 95 mol% of the products are CJ to C^ olefins, indicating that for Mo03- A1203 catalysts, the metathesis reaction takes place mainly between hexene-2, -3 and -1. Re207-Alz03 catalysts displayed a distinct behaviour. It can be seen from Table 4 that, in parallel with the previous work on the metathesis of propene [3], the reaction behaviour was found to be very sensitive to the Re207 loading. The effect of rhenia is to increase the metathesis reaction and decrease the isomerization of hexene-1, with the result that the selectivity of TABLE 3 Catalytic behaviour of the metathesis of hexene-1 over MoOy-Al^Oy catalysts after air-Nz pretreatment MoOa content D M SM Product distribution (mol%) C2\"/Cio C^/CiT C'4/Cs' CS'/CT\" 0.0 91 - - 5.3 88 5 5 0 13 39 48 13.0 86 7 8 3 16 35 46 16.3 85 7 8 0 17 37 46 22,0 86 7 8 0 17 39 44 26.0 86 7 8 3 16 37 44 123 TABLE 4 Catalytic behaviour of the metathesis of hexene-1 over Keat^-Al^Oa catalysts after air-Nz pretreatment Re207 content D M SM Product distribution (mol%) (v/t.%) ^ r ; ; = r-^r Ci/Cio C3/Cg C4/Cg Cs/C^ 0.0 53 0 0 - 3.0 15 24 60 12 25 8 55 8.6 7 30 81 35 25 6 34 15.3 5 64 93 23 31 12 34 Re207-Al203 catalysts sharply increases with the Re^C^ loading. These results clearly demonstrate that Re207-Al203 is intrinsically active for the metathesis of hexene-1. Table 4 also shows that the product distribution for Re207-Al203 catalysis is quite different from that found for the MoOa-A^Oa catalyst. For Re207-Al203 catalyst, the usual content of Ci' to C^ olefins in the product is ~70 - 80 mol% lower than that found in the case of Mo03- A12O3 catalysts. Nevertheless, the 35 - 55 mol% of C^ to C7 olefins found in the products implies appreciable effectiveness towards isomerization. The product distribution is highly temperature dependent. For example, lowering the reaction temperature favors the yield of Cr/C{o olefins. Table 5 lists the reaction behaviour for the 10 wt.% Re207-Al203 catalyst in the metathesis of hexene-1 as a function of the reaction temperature. When the reaction temperature is lowered to 413 K, the conversion of hexene-1 over the catalyst is ~47% with a selectivity to metathesis of approximately 100%. Meanwhile, only ~19 mol% Cj to CcT olefins are obtained in the products. At this temperature therefore the catalyst shows little activity for isomeriza- tion, and as a result all of the internal olefins, once formed on the catalyst, are completely transformed into metathesis products. With increasing reaction temperature, the activity towards metathesis decreases, and the percentage of hexene-2 and -3 increases in the products.

Table 6 summarises the results obtained after 3 wt.% RezC^ is incorporated into Mo03-Al203 catalysts with different MoOa loadings. Catalytic activity for the metathesis of hexene-1 increases with Mo03 loading, but the product distribution has nearly the same trend as that shown by the Mot^-A^Oa catalyst; the CJ to C^ olefin content in the products is always above 90 mol%. An optimum Mo03 loading of 12 wt.% is found for the bicomponent Re-Mo catalysts listed in Table 6; this catalyst is subsequently defined as R3M12A. It is well known that the activity and selectivity of a metathesis catalyst are easily influenced by pretreatment. For example, pretreatment in a reducing atmosphere favours the catalytic activity and selectivity towards metathesis. Table 7 and Fig. 1 show the effect on the reaction behaviour of the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst for the pretreatment variations : (a) air-N2: treatment in air at 823 K for l h followed by N2 at 823 K for l h; (b) CO: insertion of CO treatment at 723 K for 0.5 h between the air- N3 treatments of (a); (c) propene: insertion of a propene pulse treatment at 723 K between the air-N2 treatments of (a); TABLE 7 Effect of various pretreatments on the catalytic behaviour of the metathesis of hexene-1 over R3M12A Pretreatment D M SM Product distribution (mol%) air-Ni 24 75 76 l 16 36 47 CO 19 80 81 1 17 38 44 propene 65 30 32 2 18 29 51 H2 91 4 4 0 7 32 61 125 ^^o-, 80 \"-a^-^-^a^ --o^o^a- ^o~ 40 c o U 20 46 8 10 12 Number of Pulses Fig. 1.

(d) HI: insertion of ii^ treatment at 773 K for 0.5 h between the air- N3 treatments of (a). The results clearly illustrate that CO and air-N3 pretreatment produces almost the same activity and selectivity in hexene-1 metathesis, while H^ pretreatment depresses the activity of the catalyst to almost zero. It is also interesting to note that the propene pretreatment has a deleterious effect on the R3M12A catalyst, in contrast to the improvement observed for a Re207-Al203 catalyst in the metathesis of propene [3]. It would seem that even a mild reduction of the surface produces catalytic activity tending towards isomerization rather than metathesis. The temperature of N2 pretreatment. Fig. 2, has no effect on the reaction behaviour at temperatures between 473 - 823 K, whereas CO pre- treatment at 723 K produces a maximum metathesis conversion. When the CO pretreatment temperature is as high as 823 K, the activity of the catalyst is reduced very quickly, perhaps due to the heavy carbonaceous deposit formed through the disproportionation of CO (see Fig. 3).

The product distributions during the metathesis of hexene-1 over R3M12A are similar for all catalyst pretreatments, demonstrating the relative insensitivity of the isomerization reaction. The results m Table 8 compare the metathesis reactions of R3A, M12A and R3M12A catalysts. It is clear that after air-N2 and/or CO pretreatment, the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst is more active than the monocomponent catalyst. To explain these results, we suggest that the promotion effect of the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst for the metathesis of hexene-1 may arise from dual site behaviour. The active sites arising from Mo-AI surface species are mainly responsible for the isomerization of hexene-1, while the active sites which are reponsible for the metathesis of hexenes are mostly repre- sented by surface Re species. The reaction scheme of the metathesis of hexene-1 over the catalyst can be expressed as follows: direct metathesis Ca + CIQ double bond isomerization C^-1 > C6-2,C^-3 __________________I______I mixed metathesis Cy - Cg^ olefins _______________________t The activity of Mo03-Al203 catalysts for isomerization is dominantly high, but negligibly low for hexene metathesis. Direct metathetic conversion of hexene-1 is very low, contributing less to the conversion than the metathesis between the internal olefins and/or between the internal olefin and hexene-1. Consequently the metathesis products are mainly olefins ranging from C^ to Cc\". For Re207-Al203 catalysts, the activity for metathesis is comparable with that for isomerization. Since the internal olefins are more metathetically 127 active compared to hexene-1, the hexene-2 and hexene-3, once formed, would metathesize at a high rate with the consequence that a high Ci' - C^ content would still be present in the products from Re2C>7-Al203 catalysis. Lowering the reaction temperature leads to a relative increase in the activity towards the direct metathesis of hexene-1 as a direct result of the decrease in isomerization activity of this Re207-Al203 catalyst. In consequence, even at the temperature 413 K, the activity towards isomerization is reduced to such a low level that a productive, direct metathesis yield from hexene-1 is obtained. The reaction behaviour of the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst can also be interpreted using the above reaction scheme, if it is proposed that dual sites play an important role during the metathesis of hexene-1. The site of the MoOa component possesses a high activity for the isomerization reaction, and the reactant initially becomes a mixture of hexene-1, -2 and -3. The metathesis reaction of the mixed hexenes then takes place at the sites of the Re207 component, which are more active for metathesis. The reaction product distribution for the Re-Mo catalyst retains features similar to that obtained for the MoC^-AL^Os catalyst, although the former distinctly possesses a higher activity for the metathesis of hexene-1. Characterization of the R2M12A catalyst In order to provide further structural evidence in support of the dual site model for the surface of the bicomponent Re-Mo catalysts, TPR, Oa uptake, XRD, ESR and ESCA techniques were used to characterize the surface and bulk properties of the catalysts. In addition, temperature- programmed desorption of ammonia was used to characterize surface acidity. In summary, the results showed that although the active components are in a highly dispersed state (i.e. monolayer state), appreciable interaction between the surface species of Re and Mo was not observed. The promotion effect observed for the Re-Mo catalyst arises chiefly from the enhanced acidity of the molybdena-modified alumina, giving rise to more internal olefins of higher metathesis reactivity and thus facilitating the metathesis reaction of the Re sites. The TPR profiles recorded for R3A, M12A and R3M12A catalysts are presented in Fig. 4. Table 9 summarizes the results of Tmax> Ha consumption, and C>2 uptake in the TPR and 0; uptake measurements. It seems that the presence of Re cations on the surface is able to facilitate the redox process in molybdena to a certain extent. The measured ii^ consumption for both Re or Mo monocomponent catalysts is in reasonable agreement with the calculated values for the corresponding oxides. Nakamura and Echigoya [2] reported a value of about 0.20 for the ratio of 0/Re for their ResO^Al^Oa catalyst, and our result of 02 uptake for R3A is in good agreement. For the MoOa-AL^Os catalyst, the measured value of the 0/Mo ratio is somewhat lower than that reported by Millman and Hall [8]. As different temperatures (195 K and 77 K) were used for the 0^ uptake measurements, the difference can reasonably be expected. For the bicompo- 128 TABLE 9 Ha consumption and 0^ uptake of the catalysts Sample '^ax\"1 (K) TPR Ha consumption (mmolH;i(gcat)-1) Oa uptake (mol 02 (g cat)-1) Atomic ratio O/M Tml Tm2 Expt. Theor.

A possible interpretation of this fact maybe that some part of the original molybdena on the surface was removed during subsequent impregnation with rhenia, as also indicated by the ESCA measurements. In any event, Table 9 and Fig. 4 show that the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst predominantly retains the chemisorption and reduction properties of the MoOf-Al^O^ catalyst. Figure 5 is a profile of NHs desorption from the catalysts. The acidity of these catalysts increases in the sequence: AliOa ~ R3A < M12A ~ R3M12A m agreement with the interpretation proposed for the reaction behaviour of hexene-1. The fact that the surface acidity of alumina is enhanced by the incorporation Mo03 has been reported by many authors [9]. The results show that the active components of both Re;^ and Mo03 in the supported catalysts used here are in the monolayer dispersed state, as no new crystalline phases were detected other than the y-alumina phase [7]. 523 -i- 723 0.5h 923 1123 273 473 673 Temp/K Temp/K Fig. 4.

Curve 1, Al^Oa; curve 2, R3A; curve 3, M12A; curve 4, R3M12A. 129 ESR spectroscopic examination provides further evidence that there is little or no interaction between the surface species of Re and Mo cations, except for small changes included in the redox property of Mo cations due to the presence of the Re. With the existence of Re cations on the surface in an oxidizing atmosphere, the redox process between Mo(+5) and Mo(+6) is facilitated to a certain degree (see Table 10). This observation also parallels the TPR results showing that the Tmax i01 bicomponent Re-Mo-catalysts shifts toward lower temperatures. Table 11 lists the results of ESCA measurements. As far as the binding energy of Mo(3d) is concerned, no significant shift can be detected in our case. The atomic ratio of (Mo/AI) XPS is also listed in Table 11, based on the intensity of Mo(3d) and Al(2p) XPS spectra. The atomic ratio of (Mo/AI) XPS gives rise to an estimated loading of 11 wt.% of MoOa on the surface of the R3M12A catalyst, and this gives an indication of possible loss of the Mo03 component in the surface during sample preparation, which involved separated impregnations of the solid with aqueous solutions of each compo- nent. In summary, the results of various characterization studies tend to support the conclusion that the interaction between rhenia and molybdena TABLE 10 ESR measurement of Mo(+5) in M12A and R3M12A catalysts'1 Pretreatment M12A R3M12A g\\\\ 81 I 8\\\\ 81 I 823 K l h in N2 1.939 1.904 99 1.939 1.904 101 823 K Ih in Oi 1.929 - 2 - 723 K in propene 1.939 422 1.937 538 \"J (relative intensity of ESR signal) = K'(^Hpp)(Hpp)/A; A^PP. the horizontal width and Hpp, the vertical height from bottom to the top in the ESR signal concerned; A, the amplitude of the instrument used in the measurement ; and K, the proportionality coeffi- cient.

Conclusion The studies of the reaction behaviour of Mo03-Al203, Re207-Al203 and Re207-Mo03-Al203 catalysts for the metathesis of hexene-1 have revealed that Mo03/Al203 catalysts exhibit very high activity of isomeriza- tion but the least activity for the metathesis of hexene-1; on the other hand, Re207-Al203 catalysts are only moderately active for isomerization but are highly active for metathesis. Incorporating 3 wt.% Re207 into Mo03- Al203 can increase the activity for metathesis, but the product distribution is almost the same as found for Mo03-Al203 and quite different from that over the Re207-Al203 catalysts. It seems apparent that the Re cation is capable of creating efficient metathesis sites, but the rate of metathesis is still not large enough to compete with the rate of isomerization. A dual mechanism for the metathesis of hexene-1 on the bicomponent Re-Mo catalyst is therefore postulated, which emphasizes the separate existence of Re- and Mo-AI sites which respectively effect the metathesis and isomerization reactions on the surface. The study of pretreatment effects, which is a problem closely related to the nature of the active sites for metathesis reaction, also implicitly reveals the independent role of Re cations displayed by Re207-Mo03-Al203 catalysts. The catalyst characterization data of H2 TPR, 0^ uptake, NHaTPD, XRD, ESR and ESCA measurements indicate that all of the properties related to the surface state of Mo03-Al203, such as the oxidation state and binding energy of Mo cations, the dispersion, the surface acidity etc., are little influenced by the presence of Re cations. It is therefore concluded that there is no obvious interaction between Re207 and Mo03 on the surface, although the redox process and/or the changes of oxidation states in the Re207-Mo03-Al203 catalyst may possibly be facilitated owing to the intimate contact between the highly dispersed Re and Mo oxides in different and changeable oxidation states.

Surface properties of the different catalysts were examined by chemisorption measurements and through the use of various physical methods. Isomerization of hexene-1 took place in parallel with metathesis, and the resulting internal olefins (hexene-2 and -3) participated actively in the total reaction of hexenes. Consequently, in addition to C2 = and C10 =, olefins ranging from C3 = to C9 = were obtained as products, which can be illustrated by the following overall reaction scheme : Catalyst characterization data from H2 TPR, O2 uptake, NH3 TPD, XRD, ESR and ESCA measurements have indicated that all of the properties related to the surface state of the Mo oxide, such as the oxidation state and binding energies of Mo cations, the dispersion state, surface acidity etc., are scarcely influenced by the presence of Re cations. There is therefore no obvious interaction between the Re and Mo oxides on the surface. Based on the catalytic behaviour and surface properties of Re-Mo-Al2O3 observed in this work, a dual site mechanism was suggested in which the Re and Mo surface species exist independently. The main function of the Re species is to create more metathesis sites, which operate independently, while the isomerization reaction takes place on the acidic sites of the Mo-Al2O3 surface.
