Graphical abstract Core–shell structured catalysts with cobalt nanoparticles coated by the silica shell were prepared by an in situ coating method to explore the dependence of their Fischer–Tropsch synthesis performances on catalyst structures. The reduction degrees of the catalysts were decreased by silica coating as evidenced by H2-TPR results. However, the catalytic activity was not decreased due to the enhanced and stabilized particle dispersion by the shell. In addition, such core–shell structures gave rise to a higher selectivity toward methane with a lower proportion of C19+ fraction as compared with an uncoated sample, which had cobalt particles located outside the silica spheres. It was considered that the shell coating not only resulted in severe diffusion restrictions of reactants but also retarded secondary reactions of olefins, both of which shifted product distribution toward the lighter end. As a result, the shell coating improved the selectivity to middle distillates with a higher percentage of olefins. Keywords Fischer–Tropsch synthesis Cobalt Structures Silica coating Middle distillates 1 Introduction The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is well known as an indirect liquefaction process for producing high quality sulfur-free fuels from coal, natural gas, and biomass-derived syngas. Among group VIII metals, cobalt is widely recommended as a preferable catalyst due to its higher selectivity toward hydrocarbons and lower activity for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction than the iron-based systems and more efficient price than that of ruthenium [1]. Unfortunately, a key challenge within this field is that carbon number distribution of FTS products follows the Anderson–Schultz–Flory (ASF) distribution [2], which means an unselective and wide range. Most researchers currently target at increasing the selectivity toward long-chain hydrocarbons and transforming waxes into branched, liquid fuels by a subsequent hydrocracking process [3]. Compared with this two-stage technology, an alternative single-step strategy to directly produce liquid fuels without hydrocracking would be more promising and energy efficient. Considering the catalytic performances are structure-sensitive to supports, dispersions, metal loadings and preparation methods [1], catalysts with optimal structures should be designed to realize the goal of producing liquid fuels via a single-step process. For conventionally supported catalysts, the sintering of active phase is proved to be the primary cause of deactivation [4] as suggested by extended X-ray absorption fine structure results [5]. In addition, the support deformation always leads to loss of activity during reaction [6,7]. Both phenomena are the obstacles of long-term operation for catalysts in FTS reactions. Recently, the idea of core–shell morphology has been attracted to many researchers [8–11]. It is proved that shells prevent the possible sintering of the core particles and reveal high thermal stability during catalytic reactions at high temperatures [9,11]. However, the synthetic protocols for generating such a configuration involve stepwise high temperature decomposition and multiple transfers of intermediates before coating the shells [10,11]. Besides, the inert and deaerated atmosphere are required to synthesis the core particles [8,10]. Those harsh preparation conditions block the ways of large-scale synthesis of core–shell catalysts. Moreover, significant challenges still remain in establishing control over the shape and maximizing accessibility of reactants to the cores via porosity of the shell [12]. Wonderful catalytic performances might be obtained by adjusting core and shell properties of core–shell structured catalysts [9]. Tsubaki et al. [13,14] previously synthesized core–shell catalysts with acidic zeolite shell coating onto the Co/Al2O3 through hydrothermal method, which completely suppressed the formation of the C12+ hydrocarbons due to spatial confinement effect and molecular shape selectivity of zeolite shell. Our group [11] found that the core–shell structured Co3O4@mSiO2 presented higher selectivity toward C5–C18 hydrocarbons in FTS than the conventionally supported Co3O4/mSiO2, which was prepared by impregnation method. However, previous studies focused on the acidic nature of zeolite shell and the mesoporous feature of silica shell. The intrinsic effects of shell coating on the mechanism for modifying hydrocarbon distribution were not clearly understood. Based on the above discussion, herein we report a facile procedure to prepare core–shell structured catalysts with cobalt nanoparticles coated by porous silica shell. The oxidation of Co(II) to Co3O4 nanoparticles was proceeded under ambient atmosphere at the reaction temperature of 333K, which was the lowest to the present stage of our knowledge. The core–shell catalysts were prepared via an in situ coating method without the prior use of silane coupling agent [15] or ultrasonic dispersion [16]. In the present investigation, a comprehensive correlation between the shell coating in connection with the mass transfers and product distribution is established. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation All catalysts were prepared according to cobalt loadings of 15wt% in the as-synthesized catalysts by weight. Cobalt oxide particles with a size of approximately 13nm were synthesized according to Ref. [17] with some modifications. In a typical process, 0.5M hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and 0.02M Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution were mixed together under ambient atmosphere. Subsequently, a desired amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW=1300kg/mol; mass ratio of PVP/Co(NO3)2·6H2O=2) was dissolved in the mixture for 10min followed by addition of H2O2 (3%, mass ratio) under stirring. After that, the whole system was heated to 333K in a water bath reactor for 12h. Then tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added in situ and reacted for another 48h. The products were collected by filtration, drying at 333K and calcination at 823K in static air to remove organic species. The as-prepared catalyst was designated as Co@SiO2-PVP. The Co@SiO2-NP was prepared by identical steps without PVP addition. An uncoated sample with nanoparticles located outside silica spheres was also synthesized for comparison. Cobalt oxide particles were synthesized similarly to the above steps without PVP addition. Then ammonium citrate tribasic (ACT), which was equal weight to PVP, was added and dissolved under ultrasonic vibration for 30min. Addition of TEOS and latter operations were proceeded above. The obtained catalyst was designated as Co/SiO2-ACT. 2.2 Characterizations The as-prepared samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL: JEM·2010FEF microscope operated at 200kV. Before microscopy observation, the samples were suspended in ethanol and dispersed by ultrasonic vibration for 10min. Afterwards, a drop of the suspension was extracted from the top side and placed on a carbon-coated copper grid (200mesh). In order to investigate the real dispersion of core particles in the as-synthesized colloid, a drop of the colloid was directly extracted without further ultrasonic dispersion. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were received on a DX-2700 diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154184nm). The spectra were scanned at a rate of 2°min−1 in the range 2θ =5–80°. Prior to the nitrogen physisorption experiment on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 sorptometer, the samples were outgassed at 473K for 24h. The BET surface area and pore volume of the catalysts were derived from the corresponding nitrogen adsorption isotherms conducted at 77K. The adsorption average pore diameter was determined by the BJH method. 30mg of catalyst was used for hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis, which was carried out on TP-5080 multi-purpose automatic adsorption instrument by heating at the ramp rate of 10Kmin−1 with a H2/N2 (5vol%) flow. The hydrogen consumption rate was monitored in a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) calibrated previously using the reduction of CuO as standard [18]. 2.3 Catalyst test The as-prepared catalysts were tableted and sieved to obtain 60–80mesh. 2mL of catalysts were mixed with the equal volume of quartz sands and evaluated in a stainless-steel ﬁxed-bed reactor (I.D.=10mm). After reduction at 673K for 6h and cooling to room temperature, syngas with a H2/CO mole ratio of 2.0 was switched. Wax and liquid products were collected by hot trap and cold trap, respectively. The exhaust gases were analyzed on-line using Carbosieve-packed column with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Porapack-Q column with flame ionization detector (FID). Oil and wax were analyzed off-line in a GC-920 chromatograph which was equipped with a 35m OV-101 capillary column and FID. N2 with a volume ratio of 4% was blended in the syngas as an internal standard. To ensure reliability of data, results were started to collect after time on stream (TOS) of 24h with nitrogen balance, oxygen balance, carbon balance and total mass balance in the range of 100±5%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst morphologies, phases and textures The TEM images of pure cobalt oxide particles and all the composites are presented in Fig. 1 . The particles show a uniform diameter of approximately 13nm (Fig. 1a) as determined using more than 200 particles from several imaged areas. Without PVP addition, nanoparticles tend to aggregate into large clusters due to strong forces, such as van der Waals forces and magnetic dipole interactions [19]. Bulky core–shell structures are attained when direct coating silica shell onto large aggregate of cores (Fig. 1b). PVP leads to a much higher particle dispersion (Fig. 1c) because the amphiphilic character, which derives from the presence of highly polar amide group and apolar organic groups, enables its adsorption onto many surfaces [20]. Highly dispersed core–shell structures are formed with coating silica shell onto the monodispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 1d). The silica coating may be considered as a seeded growth process [20], in which TEOS tends to polymerize around particle surfaces rather than nucleate independently. ACT addition cannot disperse the core particles (Fig. 1e). Clusters of uncoated particles and self-seeded silica beads appear after TEOS addition (Fig. 1f: discerning from particle sizes, the larger particles are silica spheres and the smaller ones are cobalt oxide nanoparticles), indicating ACT is not beneficial for silica growth onto the outer surface of the particles. This result is consistent with that reported by Graf who failed to coat citrate-stabilized gold particles by silica [20]. It is known that SiO− species dominate on silica surface when the pH value is higher than 5 [21], thus the self-seeded behavior of silica is probably attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged citrate ions and SiO− species (pH=7.2). By contrast, the cobalt particle size of Co/SiO2-ACT increases evidently after TOS of 240h (Fig. 1i) as compared with that of reaction before, indicating serious sintering revealed. However, the core–shell catalysts exert strong ability to resist sintering and the original structures are well preserved (Fig. 1g and h). Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts. All the diffraction peaks are indexed according to the JCPDS card (NO. 42-1467) for cobalt oxide having a cubic spinel structure [17], suggesting that silica coating cannot change the crystal structure of core particles. The broad peaks with low intensity located in the 20–30° range (Fig. 2B–D) may result from the coexistence of amorphous silica [22]. Average crystallite size of cobalt oxide particles calculated from Scherrer equation at the most intense peak (2θ =36.8°) [18] is listed in Table 1 . As a result of the shielding effect from silica shells, Co@SiO2-NP and Co@SiO2-PVP reveal slightly weaker signals corresponding to the cobalt oxide phase than that of Co/SiO2-ACT. The textural properties of the catalysts are collected in Table 1. The Co@SiO2-PVP reveals higher surface area and pore volume than the other two samples because PVP acts as a mesoporous template [23]. Evacuation of PVP molecules during calcination leads to sufficient pore channels within silica shell, thus facilitating access of reactants to the active cores in FTS reaction. The cobalt dispersion decreases in the order of: Co@SiO2-PVP>Co@SiO2-NP>Co/SiO2-ACT, which is consistent with TEM results shown in Fig. 1. It is probably because PVP addition greatly contributes to particle dispersion and the shell coating further anchors and prevents cores from aggregating. Both effects result in the highest cobalt dispersion of Co@SiO2-PVP. It can be proposed that the shell coating makes the higher cobalt dispersion of Co@SiO2-NP than that of Co/SiO2-ACT. Due to the absence of shell protection, a certain extent of particle sintering may take place on the Co/SiO2-ACT during calcination, which leads to the lowest cobalt dispersion. 3.2 Reduction behavior The reduction behavior of the catalysts was studied by means of H2-TPR in Fig. 3 . Reduction of Co3O4 by hydrogen proceeds in two steps: first reduction of Co3O4 to CoO (473–573K); then reduction of CoO to metallic Co (523–773K). Amorphous Co/silica phase was reduced at a temperature higher than 873K [24]. As shown in Fig. 3, the reduction temperature of core–shell composites is higher than the uncoated Co/SiO2-ACT, suggesting that encapsulation of core particles by silica shell makes reduction more difficult and leads to a stronger metal-support interaction. It is considered that hydrogen needed some time to travel through the pore channels of silica shell to reach the cores, thus the reduction reactions of core–shell catalysts are lagged and shifted to higher temperatures. For the same reason, the core–shell catalysts reveal a broad reduction peaks in the range of 700–1000K. Co/SiO2-ACT shows a very weak reduction peak at 873K, indicating a little cobalt silicate is generated when cobalt particles are not incorporated into silica spheres. As calculated from the TPR profiles, the reducibility decreased in the order of: Co/SiO2-ACT>Co@SiO2-NP>Co@SiO2-PVP (Table 1). 3.3 FTS performances The catalytic results in FTS reaction are collected in Table 2 . The catalytic activity is expressed in terms of CO conversion (XCO) and cobalt time yield (CTY), which decrease in the following order of: Co@SiO2-PVP>Co/SiO2-ACT>Co@SiO2-NP. It is known that the catalytic activity is affected by the synergy of reducibility and cobalt dispersion [25], thus this order is not the same as that of reducibility (Table 1). Co/SiO2-ACT is the easiest to be reduced but do not exhibit the highest CO conversion, probably because aggregation of particles seriously decrease cobalt dispersion, which is proportional to the number of surface active sites and exposed metal atoms [26]. As discussed above, the silica coating lowers reducibility of Co@SiO2-NP, thus showing lower reactivity than Co/SiO2-ACT. It is considered that the highest cobalt dispersion of Co@SiO2-PVP contributes to the optimum catalytic activity. The decreased catalytic activity, which results from the silica coating, may be offset by the enhanced cobalt dispersion. Intrapellet diffusion limitations of reactants and products often influence the hydrocarbon selectivity in complex catalytic processes [25]. There are two types of reaction-diffusion coupling mechanisms at typical FTS conditions: (1) diffusion-limited product removal catalysts pellets and (2) diffusion-limited reactants arrival at active sites [27]. The first type increases residence time of α-olefins within catalyst pellets and enhances probability of readsorption, thus contributes to chain propagation and formation of heavier products [26]. In the second regime, severe depletion of intrapellet CO favors the formation of lower weight hydrocarbons [25]. As drawn from Table 2, both of the core–shell catalysts reveal higher selectivity toward middle distillates and gaseous products at the expense of a lower C19+ fraction than the uncoated Co3O4/SiO2-ACT, suggesting shell coating favors the formation of shorter chain hydrocarbons. It is considered that CO concentration decreases to a greater extent than H2 concentration from exterior to the center catalyst pellet [25]. Such diffusional restrictions of reactants within the pores of silica shell lead to hydrogen-rich conditions near cobalt sites, thus chain termination probability is increased and product spectrum is shifted to methane and lighter hydrocarbons [2,25]. For the Co/SiO2-ACT, alternatively, as active sites are located outside the silica spheres, no diffusional restrictions of CO exist. Enough supply of carbon sources makes sure the chain growth to heavier hydrocarbons. Based on the above discussion, our results tend to confirm the second type of reaction-diffusion mechanism, namely, diffusion-limited reactants arrival at catalyst sites. Fig. 4 illustrates the formation of olefins over the different catalysts. Linear α-olefins are known to be the primary hydrocarbon products of FTS, and their secondary reactions (hydrogenation, isomerization, re-insertion, hydrogenolysis and hydroformylation) could be modulated to modify product distributions [28]. If α-olefins escape from the particles before being readsorbed, the olefin to paraffin ratio will increase [29]. The effect of water on raising olefin to paraffin ratio has been reported by literatures [30,31]. It is considered water inhibits the secondary hydrogenation of olefin products via a competitive adsorption at cobalt sites [32]. For the core–shell structured catalysts, the generated steam film cannot timely be removed off due to the effect of silica coating, thus the adsorption of water at cobalt sites is accelerated. As a result, the olefin readsorption and hydrogenation reactions are suppressed. In that case, α-olefins escape vastly from cobalt sites and become the final products. For the same reason, the re-incorporation into chain growth plays a less role and contributes to the formation of shorter chain hydrocarbons. In addition, the finally produced olefins mostly have carbon numbers in the middle distillates spectrum, thus further increases middle distillates selectivity (Fig. 4). The higher olefin selectivity was also obtained after H-β zeolite shell coating onto the Co/Al2O3 [14]. It is worth noting that another distinction in reaction mechanisms between core–shell catalyst and conventionally structured catalysts is the secondary readsorption probability of primarily generated products on other cobalt particles (Fig. 5 ). The primarily generated hydrocarbons have higher molecular weight than the reactants, thus are not allowed to flow freely through the porous shell to reach other cobalt particles by the diffusion dynamics. As shown in Fig. 5a, the readsorption of olefins on other cobalt cores is effectively restrained by the shell, thus favoring the formation of shorter chain hydrocarbons. However, the olefin readsorption is not limited by conventional structures, and the chain growth normally proceeds on these catalysts (Fig. 5b and c). This behavior offers resonable explaination to the higher C19+ selectivity of Co@SiO2-NP than that of Co@SiO2-PVP. The probability of olefin readsorption is greatly enhanced when many cores are embedded in a single silica sphere (Fig. 1b). 4 Conclusions The effects of shell coating in FTS reaction were investigated by core–shell structured catalysts as compared with an uncoated sample. The silica coating led to a decreased reducibility, whereas the catalytic activity was not decreased due to the enhanced cobalt dispersion. The core–shell catalysts exhibited a middle distillate distribution of hydrocarbons because the shell coating gave rise to severe diffusion restrictions of reactants and restrained secondary reactions (readsorption and hydrogenation) of α-olefins, from which higher selectivity of olefins was also obtained. Furthermore, silica coating onto particles appeared to be resistant to the sintering.
