Introduction The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide has been recognized to be one of the most serious problems in the world and a number of countermeasures have been proposed so far. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce various kinds of chemicals and fuels has received much attention as one of the most promising mitigation options. In particular, methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation has been considered to play a role in the transportation of hydrogen energy produced from natural energy such as solar energy, hydropower, and so on. NIRE and RITE have been doing a joint research on methanol synthesis by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide [1]. A practical methanol synthesis process greatly requires a high performance catalyst, which must be highly active and * Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 81-298) 588170, fax.

Saito et aL /Appfied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 311-318 selective for methanol synthesis and also stable for a long period in continuous operation. Since it has been reported that Cu/ZnO-based catalysts are effective for this reaction [2-8], we have tried to elucidate the role of metal oxides such as Ga203, A1203, ZrO2 and Cr203 contained in Cu/ZnO-based ternary cata- lysts and then we have developed Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts containing two or three metal oxides on the basis of the role of metal oxides. The present paper reports on the role of metal oxides contained in the perfor- mance of Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts developed in the joint research. 2. Experimental Various Cu/ZnO-based catalysts containing one to three metal oxide compo- nents were prepared by a coprecipitation method [9]. A mixed aqueous solution of metal nitrates (total metal concentration 1 mol/1) and an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (1.1 mol/1) were added dropwise to distilled water. Subsequently, the precipitate was filtered out, washed with distilled water, dried in air at 393 K overnight, calcined in air at 623 K for 2 h, finally screened to size between 60 and 80 mesh. The catalyst fixed in a reactor was reduced in a gas mixture of H2 (10%) and He (90%) at 523 K with a total pressure of 5 MPa. The hydrogena- tion of CO2 was then carried out at 523 K with a total pressure of 5 MPa in a fixed bed flow reactor by feeding a gas mixture of H2 and CO2 with a molar ratio of HJCO2 = 3 [9,10]. The reaction products were analyzed by means of gas chromatographs directly connected to the reactor. The catalyst activity was measured 2 h after supplying the feed gas to the reactor except for a long term (3400 h) methanol synthesis test. The total copper surface area of each catalyst after the reaction (Cutota1) was determined by the technique of N20 reactive frontal chromatography (RFC) after re-reducing the post-reaction catalyst with H2 at 523 K [11]. The surface area of metallic copper (Cureact) during the reaction was also estimated by the RFC technique after exposing the post-reac- tion catalyst to a stream of He at near ambient temperature. The oxygen coverage (Oo) was calculated by the following equation [10]: Oo = (CutotaI - Cureact)//(CUtotalX2). Here, we assumed that a N20 reacts with two Cu atoms on the Cu surface and that the saturation coverage of oxygen is ~9o = 0.5. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reaction paths for methanol synthesis The main products of CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO-based catalysts were methanol, CO and water. Methane, dimethyl ether and methyl formate were also M.

Fig. 1 shows the yields of methanol and CO as a function of reciprocal space velocity (1/SV = V/F). Methanol and CO were formed simultaneously at low conversions of CO2 by the following two reactions: CO2 -4- 3H2 ~ CH3OH + H20 (1) CO2+H2 ~ CO+H20 (2) The yield of CO increased with 1/SV and reached a maximum when reaction (2) had nearly attained equilibrium. It then gradually decreased, while reaction (2) remained in equilibrium. On the other hand, the yield of methanol gradually increased with 1/SV until reaction (1) attained equilibrium. These findings indicate that methanol was formed via reaction (1), not via reaction (2) followed by reaction (3) shown in the following: CO + 2H2 ~ CHsOH (3) Fig. 2 shows the inhibitory effect of water on methanol synthesis and CO formation, and also that of CO on methanol synthesis. The methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO-based catalysts was inhibited both by water and by CO, and the inhibitory effect of water was stronger than that of CO formation. The inhibitory effects of water and CO can explain the finding that the rate of methanol synthesis decreased with increasing 1/SV, as shown in Fig. 1. When using a mixture of CO, CO2 and H2 as a feed, which is used in industrial processes for methanol synthesis from natural gas, the yield of methanol almost linearly increased with increasing 1/SV, as shown in Fig. 1. This can be explained as follows: methanol and water are formed via reaction (1) and then water formed reacts with CO to produce CO2 and H2 via the 314 M.

Accordingly, methanol is apparently produced from CO and H2 in the feed mixture and a very small amount of water is formed, and thus methanol synthesis is hardly inhibited. 3.2. The role of metal oxides contained in Cu / ZnO-based ternary catalysts The methanol synthesis activities which were expressed by mass-time yields of methanol (MTY), total Cu surface areas (CUtotal) and the specific activities, i.e., MTY/CUtotal, of Cu/ZnO-based ternary catalysts (Cu/ZnO/MxOy) con- taining various metal oxides were examined. Table 1 shows the activities of a Cu/ZnO catalyst and the ternary catalysts containing optimum amounts of Table 1 Activities of Cu/ZnO and Cu/ZnO-based ternary catalysts containing the optimum amount of metal oxides Catalyst Composition Cu surface area a Methanol synthesis Specific activity (wt.-%) (m2/g-ca0 activity b (mg-CH3OH/m2 h) (g-CH 3OH/kg-cat h) Cu/ZnO 50/50 36.5 516 14.1 Cu/ZnO/Ga203 50/25/25 37.6 738 19.6 Cu/ZnO/AI20a 50/45/5 47.1 721 15.3 Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 50/40/10 46.0 665 14.5 Cu/ZnO/Cr203 50/45/5 32.8 602 18.4 a Total Cu surface (Cutota,) of the catalysts re-reduced at 523 K after CO2 hydrogenation were measured by N20 reactive frontal chromatography. b Reaction conditions: weight of catalyst = 1 g, H2/CO2 ratio in the feed = 3, feed gas rate = 300 ml/min, temperature = 523 K, total pressure = 5 MPa.

Ga203, A1203, ZrO2 and Cr203, which were higher than that of a Cu/ZnO catalyst by a factor of 43%, 40%, 30% and 17%, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the methanol synthesis activity of Cu/ZnO-based ternary catalysts containing Ga203, A1203, ZrO2 and Cr203 on varying the content from 5 to 40 wt.-% as a function of total Cu surface area (CUtota~). For each metal oxide contained in the Cu/ZnO-based catalysts, a linear relationship between MTY and CutotaI was seen, indicating that the specific activity is identical for each metal oxide even if the content of a metal oxide in a Cu/ZnO-based catalyst is varied. The specific activities for the Cu/ZnO-based catalysts containing Ga203 and Cr203 were greater than that of a Cu/ZnO catalyst by factor of 40% and 30%, respectively. On the other hand, the specific activity was not altered by the addition of A1203 or ZrOz, though these metal oxides play a role in increasing Cu surface area. This indicates that the addition of AI203 or ZrO2 improves the dispersion of Cu particles without changing the specific activity of a Cu/ZnO catalyst, while Ga203 and Cr203 are not effective for improving the dispersion of Cu, but are effective for increasing the specific activity of a Cu/ZnO catalyst. As it was reported that a part of the surface of Cu particles was covered with oxygen after methanol synthesis from CO/COz/H2 [11], the oxygen coverage of the Cu surface after the reaction for various Cu-based catalysts was measured. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the specific activities and the oxygen coverage of the Cu surface for the Cu-based catalysts containing different metal oxides. An excellent correlation was obtained, where the specific activity increased linearly with the oxygen coverage below 19o=0.16, reached a maximum at 19o = 0.17 and then decreased above 19o --- 0.18. The presence of oxygen formed on the Cu surface during the reaction is indicative of the presence of Cu+ species bound to the surface oxygen. Therefore, the results 316 M.

The increase in the specific activity by the addition of Ga203 or Cr203 indicates that the addition of Ga203 or Cr203 optimizes the ratio of Cu+/Cuon the Cu surface. In summary, the role of metal oxides contained in a Cu/ZnO-based catalyst was classified into two categories: (1) A1203 or ZrO2 improves the surface area of Cu, i.e., the dispersion of Cu particles in the catalyst. (2) Ga203 or Cr203 increases the specific activity by optimizing the ratio of Cu +/Cuon the surface of Cu particles. 3.3. Performance of Cu / ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts Two kinds of Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts named MCA (Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/AI203) and MCB (Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/AI203/Ga203) were prepared by selecting metal oxides on the basis of the role of metal oxide Table 2 Activities of Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts Catalyst Cu surface area a Methanol synthesis Specific activity (m2/g-cat) activity b (mg-CH3OH/m2 h) (g-CH 3 OH/kg-cat h) MCA (Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/AI2 03) 49.9 767 15.3 MCB (Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/AI203/Ga203) 44.5 785 17.6 a Total Cu surface areas of the catalysts were measured in the same way as shown in Table 1. b Reaction conditions were the same as shown in Table 1.

Table 2 shows the methanol synthesis activities of the multi- component catalysts. The activities of the multicomponent catalysts were higher than those of the ternary catalysts and MCB exhibited the highest activity. The total Cu surface area of MCA was higher than that of Cu/ZnO/AI203, but the specific activity of MCA was the same as that of Cu/ZnO/AI203. On the other hand, the specific activity of MCB was higher than that of Cu/ZnO/A1203, though the total Cu surface area of MCB was somewhat smaller than that of Cu/ZnO/A1203. These findings indicate that the promoting effect of metal oxides is exerted in the multicomponent catalysts as well as in the ternary catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the activities of the multicomponent catalysts, Cu(50)/ZnO(45)/A1203(5) and Cu(50)/ZnO(50) as a function of the tempera- ture of pretreatment in H2 ranging from 523 to 723 K. The activities of all the catalysts decreased with increasing pretreatment temperature mainly due to the decrease in Cu surface area by the sintering of Cu particles. However, the activities of MCB and MCA decreased only 10% and 15% even in pretreatment at 723 K, respectively, while the activities of the ternary catalyst and the binary catalyst decreased 30% and 85%, respectively. This suggests that the sintering of Cu particles can be suppressed by the addition of several metal oxides to Cu/ZnO. A methanol synthesis catalyst for a practical process should have a stable activity for a long period in continuous operation. A long-term methanol synthesis test was performed at 523 K with a total pressure of 5 MPa for 3400 h by using a gas mixture of CO2, CO and H2, because unreacted gas and CO must be recycled to the reactor in a practical methanol synthesis process. Fig. 6 shows the change in the activities of MCB, which was the best one of all the catalysts tested, and of a commercial catalyst used for methanol synthesis from syngas 318 M.

The activity of MCB decreased only by 17% in 1000 h during the test, but remained unchanged between 1000 and 3400 h. On the other hand, the activity of the commercial catalyst decreased by 20% in 1000 h, and still decreased to 75% of the initial activity in 2100 h. These findings suggest that the multicomponent catalyst developed in the present work is very stable for a long period in continuous methanol synthesis operation. In conclusion, the presented results clearly show that the Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts developed in the joint research are highly effective for a practical methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation.
