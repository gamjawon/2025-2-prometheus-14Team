Graphical abstract Morphology control of cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids on nickel foam is achieved by one-step electrodeposition in deep eutectic solvents, exhibiting the enhanced electrocatalytic performance for water reduction and oxidation. Active non-noble metal catalysts plays a decisive role for water electrolysis, however, the rational design and development of cost-efficient electrocatalysts with Pt/IrO2-like activity is still a challenging task. Herein, a facile one-step electrodeposition route in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) is developed for morphology-controllable synthesis of cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids on nickel foam (CoPO@C/NF). A series of CoPO@C/NF nanostructures including cubes, octahedrons, microspheres and nanoflowers are synthesized, which show promising electrocatalytic properties toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). Such surface self-organized microstructure with accessible active sites make a significant contribution to the enhanced electrochemical activity, and hybridizing cobalt oxide with cobalt pyrophosphates and carbon can result in enhanced OER performance through synergistic catalysis. Among all nanostructures, the obtained microspherical CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, affording an anodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 293 mV for OER and 93 mV for HER, with good long-time stability. This work offers a practical route for engineering the high-performance electrocatalysts towards efficient energy conversion and storage devices. Keywords Cobalt-based electrocatalysts Oxygen evolution reaction Hydrogen evolution reaction Deep eutectic solvents Electrodeposition 1 Introduction Growing energy demands together with environmental pollution have stimulated extensive attention in alternative energy conversion and storage systems, such as electrochemical overall water splitting, fuel cells and metal-air batteries [1–3]. Among them, the water electrolysis, a combination of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is figured to be one of the most promising strategies to realize sustainable and carbon-free source of energy stored by hydrogen fuel. Owing to the complex and multistep four-electron transfer pathways, the OER process was considered as the bottleneck of water electrolysis [4,5]. Thus, it is essential to design and develop high-performance catalysts for promoting OER kinetics and efficiency. Ir- and Ru-based materials are recognized as the most active OER catalysts, though their rare nature and high cost limit their further industrial-scale application [6–10]. A series of cost-efficient non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for OER have then been reported to date [11–15]. Featuring tunable electronic structure, low cost and high efficiency, Co-based oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides and phosphates, have received more and more attention for efficient electrochemical water oxidation [12–23]. In particular, Co3O4 has garnered tremendous research interest owing to its low price and good anticorrosion resistance in alkaline solution, showing the encouraging water splitting potential [24,25]. However, its catalytic efficiency is restricted by poor dispersion, questionable conductivity and insufficient active sites [25]. It is reported that the enhanced OER activity of Co3O4 can be anticipated by constructing hybrid nanocomposites through coupling with other ingredients [26,27]. For instance, electron transfer from Co3O4 to Co3(PO4)2 enable the Co3(PO4)2-Co3O4 hybrid to have a high OER performance [26]; hybridizing Co3O4 with Au has resulted in greatly increased OER activity through enhancing the binding of Co3O4 to oxygen [27]. On the other hand, decoration of Co3O4 on conductive substrates (such as Ni foam, Ti mesh and carbon paper) is also a good strategy to improve OER performance owing to the fast charge transfer between Co3O4 and substrates [17–21]. However, most of the reported catalysts are generally synthesized in the form of particle agglomerates that to be coated onto nickel foam, carbon paper or glassy carbon for electrode application [28–30]. The time-consuming coating procedure and the addition of high-cost polymeric binders (such as Nafion or PTFE) could result in uncontrolled microstructure and unfavorable electron conductivity of the prepared samples, thus yielding a compromised performance in water electrocatalysis [31–33]. By two-step preparation procedure of hydrothermal treatment and subsequent anneal treatment under different reaction conditions, various self-supported electrocatalysts such as Co3O4/NF [34], CoSe2/CFP [35], Co@Co9S8 [36] and CoP/CC [37], were synthesized at the expense of inconvenience, high cost and security risks. It is reported that one-step electrodeposition technology in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows significant potential to prepare self-supported electrode due to its rapid, nontoxic, low-cost, bind-free procedure as well as wide potential window [38,39]. Moreover, by adjusting the parameters of the electrodeposition, the morphology, size and texture of the fabricated catalysts could be well controlled, which provides a new platform for studying the structure-performance relationship of the catalysts. Recently, alloys or oxides based on transition metals addressed as Ni-Mo [40], Ni-Co [41], Co3O4 [42] and Co2P2O7 [43] have been electrodeposited in DESs electrolytes, however, their application in electrochemical water reduction and oxidation has remained largely unexplored. Besides, it is necessary yet undeveloped about controllable synthesis of active electrocatalysts with well-designed morphology for highly efficient OER kinetic process. Herein, cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids supported on nickel foam (denoted as CoPO@C/NF) are prepared via a facile one-step electrodeposition in DESs. By tuning the deposition potential, CoPO@C/NF with various morphologies are obtained, such as cubes, octahedrons, microspheres and nanoflowers. The formation mechanism for CoPO@C/NF nanohybrids through electrodeposition in DESs is proposed, providing an insight for morphology-controllable synthesis of nanostructured Co-based catalysts. The electrocatalytic properties of the obtained CoPO@C/NF samples are investigated for OER and HER, indicating the morphology effect of electrocatalysts. The microspherical CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst shows the electrochemical performance of small overpotentials of 293 mV for OER and 93 mV for HER at 10 mA cm−2 with robust stability, outperforming most of the previously reported Co-based catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Choline chloride (ChCl, 99 wt%), ethylene glycol (EG, 99%), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99%) and sodium hypophosphite (Na2H2PO2·H2O, 99%) were purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Co., Ltd. (China). All chemicals used here are of reagent grade and directly used without further purification. To obtain the eutectic solvents, ChCl (25 g) and EG (20 mL) were homogeneously mixed under vigorous stirring and kept in a dryer at 80 °C. Then, CoCl2·6H2O and Na2H2PO2·H2O with a concentration ratio of 0.05:0.05 were added into 40 mL of the obtained DESs. The electrodeposition was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical reaction cell using an IM6&ZENNIUM workstation, where carbon rod and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) are used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. A clean Ni foam (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) was used as the working electrode and electrodeposited for 3 h at constant potential. To study the effect of applied potential on the morphology of samples, the deposition potential was set at −1.4, −1.5, −1.6 and −1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the collected samples were washed with deionized water followed by drying at 65 °C for 10 h, denoted as CoPO@C/NF-1, CoPO@C/NF-2, CoPO@C/NF-3 and CoPO@C/NF-4, respectively. 2.2 Characterization Nickel foam attached with the prepared catalysts was directly observed for explicating the surface feature of the electrodeposited film. The catalyst powders were collected through ultrasonic treatment in ethanol for 5 min. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was carried out by using a CIT-3000SL X-ray fluorescence instrument composed of an X-ray tube working at 25 kV and 0.1 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Jeol JSM-6490LV microscope to observe the morphology of electrodeposited film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) to characterize the crystalline structures in a 2θ scan range from 10° to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo ESSCALAB 250 analyzer equipped with Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) to confirm the electronic state. The spectrometer energy scale was calibrated by C 1s (284.6 eV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed on a Jeol JEM 2100F microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV to observe grain diameter and crystalline structure. The sample was dispersed in ethanol and then dropped on the copper grid covered with porous carbon film. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical characterizations were performed on a conventional three-electrode system using IM6&ZENNIUM electrochemical instrument at room temperature. Carbon rod and Pt wire were used as a counter electrode for HER and OER, respectively. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was used as a reference electrode, which was protected from alkaline solution by a glass salt bridge. All the potentials were referred to the RHE following the equation E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH + E o Ag/AgCl without correcting iR drop. All of the tests were carried out in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14). The OER and HER activities of the as-prepared materials were tested by linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Tafel slop is calculated by the equation η = b log j + a , where η is the over potential, j is the current density, b is the Tafel slope, and a is the cathodic intercept related to the exchange current density. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were measured at a window of 0 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl and 1.13 to 1.18 V vs. RHE to access the electrocatalytic activity and calculate the electric double layer capacitance (C dI). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were evaluated with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at the amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage of 5 mV. The stability of the prepared materials were tested in two ways: one is 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 through CV, the other is chronoamperometric curves at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 for 12 h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Material synthesis and characterization The self-supported cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids (CoPO@C/NF) were prepared via a facile one-step electrodeposition in deep eutectic solvents (DESs). During potentiostatic electrodeposition, anions and cations from Co-P plating baths would undergo a redox reaction [39], resulting in deposition of Co-based oxides on the Ni foam. Over time, the resulting materials would undergo nucleation and growth, and the final morphology of the samples may be related to the applied potential. Acting as both reactant and pseudosurfactant, the existence of Na2H2PO2·H2O is essential to synthesize Co2P2O7 with phosphate group [26]. Meanwhile, the organic components from DESs would suffer from decomposition reaction and be electrodeposited onto the Ni foam. The resulting carbon composition is not only good for the improvement of the conductivity of catalysts but also beneficial to the exposure of active sites [44]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained samples are presented in Fig. 1 (a). Almost no significant diffractions were observed for the sample CoPO@C/NF-1 obtained by electrodeposition at −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while for the samples CoPO@C/NF-2, CoPO@C/NF-3 and CoPO@C/NF-4 obtained by electrodeposition at −1.5, −1.6 and −1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl respectively, except one broad peaks at about 24.1° (2θ) and still no other significant diffraction peaks were observed, indicating their amorphous nature of CoPO@C/NF [45]. To investigate the element species of the prepared samples, XRF analysis was performed on CoPO@C/NF. The corresponding XRF result (Fig. 1b) reveals the coexistence of Ni and Co elements, implying the coverage of the pristine Ni foam with cobalt element by electrodeposition. Additionally, the cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements with a wider potential window of samples were investigated, as depicted in Fig. 1(c). Ni foam shows a pair of obvious redox peaks (Fig. 1c, inset) when deposited in 5 sec, which is disappeared with the increase of reaction time to 120 min. In sharp contrast, three redox peaks were observed for CoPO@C/NF-x samples (Fig. 1c), attributing to the conversion among different cobalt oxide state (CoO, Co2O3, and Co3O4) during potential sweep [46]. Notably, the higher peak current of CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst both in cathode and anode was observed, as compared with other three control samples (Fig. 1d), indicating that the CoPO@C/NF-3 may have the best electrochemical capacity among all CoPO@C/NF-x samples for OER [47]. The morphology and structure of CoPO@C/NF were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images (Fig. S1) of CoPO@C/NF-x samples display the full coverage of the pristine Ni foam (Fig. S2) with rough-structure products. Note that the roughness and uniformity of the sample are different at each sample, and the surface of CoPO@C/NF-2 (Fig. S1b) and CoPO@C/NF-3 (Fig. S1c) is much more uniform and smoother than that of CoPO@C/NF-1 (Fig. S1a) and CoPO@C/NF-4 (Fig. S1d). Obvious cracks and even the exposure of partial Ni foam were observed for the surface of CoPO@C/NF-1 and CoPO@C/NF-4, implying the formation of low-quality CoPO@C/NF catalyst at too low or too high applied potentials. The high-magnification SEM images further indicate that the morphology of the prepared CoPO@C/NF-x samples could be well controlled by tuning the deposition potential, such as cubes, octahedrons, microspheres and nanoflowers, as depicted in Fig. 2 (a). Specifically, the cube-like particles (Fig. 2b) were obtained when the applied potential was set as −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Such cube-like particles are distributed in a wide size, the small cube is branching and the large cube is intact, indicating that the growth process might be controlled by branching growth. The large cube particle (Fig. 2b, inset) possesses a smooth face and relatively unambiguous edge, with a diameter of ~5 μm. This might be because that atoms could obtain the Gibbs free energy from entire system to reach this final state due to enough electrodeposition time. Increasing the potential to −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the morphology of the resultant sample changed from cube-like particles to octahedra with small size of ~300 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(c), but this octahedra suffers from obvious agglomeration during the electrodeposition. Further increasing the potential to −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the ball-shaped particles with a diameter of ~2 μm were obtained (Fig. 2d), with the fluffy surface. Finally, the nanoflower-like particles with a size of 200–300 nm formed when the potential was set as −1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Such petal-shape particles are aligned irregularly with a large voids amongst, as shown in Fig. 2(e). All these observations confirm that the applied potential plays an important role in controlling the morphology of CoPO@C/NF-x samples. Morphology and structure properties of CoPO@C/NF-x catalysts were further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With the increase of the applied potential, the morphology of the CoPO@C/NF-x catalysts exhibited obvious changes, from agglomerated nanosheets (Fig. 2f) to fluffy nanosheets (Fig. 2g) to microspheres (Fig. 2h) and nanoflowers (Fig. 2i), which is in good agreement with the SEM results (Fig. 2b–e). Among these, the ball-like structure of CoPO@C/NF-3 with a diameter of ~1.5 μm was assembled with 2D nanosheets (Fig. 2h). Further HRTEM image of CoPO@C/NF-3 in Fig. S3(a) reveals that the existence of seven sets of parallel lattice fringes: the three interplanar spacings of 0.202, 0.244 and 0.286 nm can be ascribed to the (400), (311) and (220) crystalline planes of Co3O4 (JCPDS 65–3103), respectively, and the other spacings of 0.215, 0.217, 0.225 and 0.255 nm fit well with the (413), (314), (304) and (220) planes of hexagonal Co2P2O7 (JCPDS 34-1378). The presence of cobalt pyrophosphate is expected to afford an excellent ability for enhanced electrocatalytic performance due to the strong adsorption of P2O7 4− on the intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*, etc.) for OER [24–26]. It is noted that the phase composition of each sample is varied from the electrodeposition voltage. As depicted in Fig. S4, at the voltage of 1.4 V the sample mainly represents a phase of Co3O4, fitting to the cube in micro-size. The phase at voltage of 1.5 and 1.7 V is the mixture of Co3O4 (marked in yellow) and CoP2O7 (marked in white). The elemental mapping image of CoPO@C/NF-3 (Fig. S3b) reveals the uniform distribution of Co, P, O and C elements on CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst, suggesting the possible hybridizing Co3O4 with Co2P2O7 and carbon, which might effectively boost OER kinetics and efficiency [26]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to elucidate the superficial chemical state of CoPO@C/NF-x samples. The typical peaks of C, P, Co and O were observed in the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S5), and their detailed content in each CoPO@C/NF-x sample is shown in Table S1. Seen from Fig. 3 (a), C 1s region of CoPO@C/NF-3 shows three peaks at 284.6, 285.9 and 288.5 eV corresponding to CC/CH, COC and OCO bond, respectively [48]. From Fig. 3(b), the O 1 s peaks at 533.5, 532.6, 531.5 and 530.2 eV are assigned to carbonxyl (COO), hydroxyl (COH)/ether (COC), carbonyl (CO)/quinone groups and cobalt oxide, respectively [49]. In Co 2p region (Fig. 3c), the peaks at about 781.0 and 796.6 eV can be attributed to Co3+ 2p 3/2 and Co3+ 2p 1/2, together with two satellite vibrations at 785.5 and 802.7 eV [50]. And two peaks at 782.5 and 798.1 eV are assigned to Co2+ 2p 3/2 and Co2+ 2p 1/2, together with two satellite vibrations at 787.5 and 804.6 eV. The distance between the two peaks of Co3+ 2p 1/2 (Co2+ 2p 1/2) and Co3+ 2p 3/2 (Co2+ 2p3/2) is 15.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ [50]. The corresponding oscillating satellite peaks appear at ~6 eV above the main peak, which is the characteristic of Co3O4 phase [39]. As depicted in Fig. 3(d), the deconvoluted two sub-peaks lying at 132.3 eV for P 2p 3/2 and 134.1 eV for P 2p 1/2 indicate the existence of the phosphate group of P2O7 4−, where the valence of P is +5 [39]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic OER and HER activities The OER activity of CoPO@C/NF-x samples was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH solution by using a typical three-electrode system. The pristine Ni foam and commercial IrO2 were used for comparison. From Fig. 4 (a), the Ni foam shows almost zero OER performance, however, CoPO@C/NF-x samples display excellent OER catalytic activity. Among these CoPO@C/NF-x samples, the CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of 293 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2, which is close to that of IrO2 catalyst (290 mV) and also lower than most of the previously reported Co-based catalysts (Table S2). Besides, the corresponding Tafel slope (Fig. 4b) of CoPO@C/NF-3 is 111.4 mV dec−1, smaller than that of CoPO@C/NF-1 (122.6 mV dec−1), CoPO@C/NF-2 (121.1 mV dec−1) and CoPO@C/NF-4 (130.0 mV dec−1), implying a more efficient OER kinetics by using sphere-like CoPO@C/NF-3 electrode. The robust stability of CoPO@C/NF-3 electrode was also revealed by 1000 CV scanning (Fig. 4c) and chronoamperometry measurements (Fig. 4d). The almost overlapped polarization curves are observed after 1000 cycles, and the overpotential slightly increase by ~70 mV after long-time electrochemical test, implying the excellent long-time stability of CoPO@C/NF-3. Further, the TEM image (Fig. S6a) of CoPO@C/NF-3 after long-time electrochemical test show that it maintains the morphology, and the EDX elemental mappings (Fig. S6b) also suggest that Co, P, O and C elements are still uniformly distributed over the microspheres after stability test. These results show the robust electrochemical stability of CoPO@C/NF-3 electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to further investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of CoPO@C/NF-x samples. As depicted in Fig. 4(e), lower charge transfer resistance (R ct) value was observed for CoPO@C/NF-3 as compared with CoPO@C/NF-1/2/4 samples, implying that CoPO@C/NF-3 possesses faster electron-transport rate and better electrocatalytic ability. Fitted value including the constant-phase elements by equivalent circuit in Fig. 4(e) is listed in Table S3, and CoPO@C/NF-3 reveals the minimum of R s (0.514) and R ct (0.634) in all CoPO@C/NF-x samples. The constant n with value nearing to 1.0 suggests the capacitance feature of the prepared samples [51]. Additionally, a potential range where no obvious Faradaic processes occur (Fig. S7) is chosen as the potential window (1.13–1.18 V) to study the double-layer capacitance (C dl) of CoPO@C/NF-x samples at different scan rates. The C dl values (Fig. 4f) of CoPO@C/NF-1, CoPO@C/NF-2, CoPO@C/NF-3 and CoPO@C/NF-4 are 138.9, 318.6, 638.0 and 284.1 mF cm−2, respectively, suggesting that CoPO@C/NF-3 can expose more active sites for OER or HER than other samples. Encouraged by the outstanding electrocatalytic capacity, we further investigated the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances of CoPO@C/NF-x samples. As expected, the CoPO@C/NF-3 affords a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 93 mV (Fig. 5 a), outperforming that of CoPO@C/NF-1 (135 mV), CoPO@C/NF-2 (102 mV), CoPO@C/NF-4 (147 mV) and many of other recently reported Co-based catalysts (Table S4). Also, the CoPO@C/NF-3 shows a Tafel slope (Fig. 5b) as small as 103.3 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of CoPO@C/NF-1 (120.1 mV dec−1), CoPO@C/NF-2 (111.2 mV dec−1) and CoPO@C/NF-4 (120 mV dec−1), confirming the more efficient HER kinetics and the higher electrochemical activity per active electrocatalysis site of CoPO@C/NF-3. The HER stability of CoPO@C/NF-3 was further probed by the accelerated degradation test for 1000 cycles at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Seen from Fig. 5(c), the LSV curves before and after 1000 CV test displays no obvious change, revealing that the CoPO@C/NF-3 is stable for HER. Besides, the CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst can maintain its HER activity for at least 12 h, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Based on the compositional analyses and electrochemical performance results, the remarkable catalytic activities of CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst for OER and HER can be ascribed to the following factors: (1) One-step electrodeposition technology in DESs shows a great advantage to produce well-designed CoPO@C/NF-x catalysts due to its rapid, nontoxic, low cost and bind free procedure. By using this facile one-step deposition strategy, active ingredients were in situ grown on the flexible Ni foam, acting as working electrode without using expensive binders (Nafion or PTFE), which could not only boost the charge transfer but also endow catalyst with robust stability [10]. Additionally, the morphology of the prepared CoPO@C/NF can be well controlled by tuning the deposition potential (Fig. 2). This self-organized surface microstructure with accessible active sites makes a significant contribution to the improved electrochemical activity. (2) The 3D conductive framework combined with the introduced carbon component plays a vital role in enhancing charge transportation and reducing the ohmic drop during HER and OER, which can be well confirmed by C dl and EIS tests, as shown in Fig. 4(e and f). In addition, it is reported that structural optimization of the electrocatalysts through amorphous engineering can expose richactive sites and induce defective sites to enhance catalytic activity [47]. Thus, the amorphous nature of CoPO@C/NF, revealed by XRD results (Fig. 1a), may be conducive to enhance the electrochemical activity. Further, TEM result reveals that the ball-like structure of CoPO@C/NF-3 is mainly composed of 2D nanosheets (Fig. 2h), which would provide a high exposure of the active sites and shorten the mass and charge transfer paths. (3) Generally, the OER process involves four electron transfer steps as following: (1) 2 H 2 O + M e ∗ → MeO H ∗ + H 2 O + e - + H + (2) MeO H ∗ + H 2 O → Me O ∗ + H 2 O + e - + H + (3) Me O ∗ + H 2 O → MeOO H ∗ + e - + H + (4) MeOO H ∗ → O 2 + e - + H + , where Me means active metals and asterisk (*) denotes the adsorption state. Based on these electron transfer steps, it is seen that the electrochemical OER performance of catalysts is greatly affected by the oxidation state of Co, such as Co(II), Co(III) or mixture of Co(II)/Co(III) [52]. In this work, the XPS Co 2p analysis reveals the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ species (Fig. 3c), indicating the multivalent oxidation state of Co in the CoPO@C/NF, which facilitates the adsorption and stabilization of various OER intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*, etc.) [53]. As depicted in Fig. 6 , the OH− was initially adsorbed on Co(II) sites to form Co(III)OH species together with the formation of one electron. Subsequently, the formed Co(III)OH would be further converted to intermediate Co(IV)O species, followed by adsorption of another OH− to produce Co(III)OOH species. Finally, with adsorption of another OH−, oxygen and water products would be released from the Co(III)OOH species. On the other hand, hybridizing Co3O4 with Co2P2O7 could synergistically enhance the electrocatalytic activity of CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst (Fig. 6a) [26]. Co(II)/Co(III) sites play a key role in adsorption of water molecule [24,25], and the phosphate group is capable of the enhanced adsorption and conversion of intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*, etc.) of OER [26]. Therefore, the adsorption/desorption energy barriers of these reaction intermediates are significantly reduced, and thus effectively boosting the OER process. 4 Conclusions Well-designed CoPO@C/NF catalysts with controlled morphology have been synthesized by a one-step electrodeposition technology in DESs, exhibiting extraordinary activity and robust stability for OER in 1.0 M KOH. By adjusting the applied potential, the morphology of the prepared CoPO@C/NF samples can be well controlled, from cubes to octahedrons to spheres and nanoflowers. Such varied morphologies resulted in the big difference in electrochemical performance, and the spherical CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst exhibits the best OER and HER activities in all CoPO@C/NF-x samples. The outstanding electrochemical performance of CoPO@C/NF-3 mainly originates from integrated effects of stable self-supporting system, well-designed nanostructure and hybridizing Co3O4 with Co2P2O7 and carbon. Moreover, it is also confirmed that one-step electrodeposition technology in DESs shows a great potential to produce well-designed catalysts due to its rapid, nontoxic, low-cost and bind-free procedure. This DESs-assisted electrodeposition method can be extended to the design and development of other non-noble electrocatalysts for efficient energy conversion reactions.

        "dc:description": "Active non-noble metal catalysts plays a decisive role for water electrolysis, however, the rational design and development of cost-efficient electrocatalysts with Pt/IrO2-like activity is still a challenging task. Herein, a facile one-step electrodeposition route in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) is developed for morphology-controllable synthesis of cobalt oxide/phosphate-carbon nanohybrids on nickel foam (CoPO@C/NF). A series of CoPO@C/NF nanostructures including cubes, octahedrons, microspheres and nanoflowers are synthesized, which show promising electrocatalytic properties toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). Such surface self-organized microstructure with accessible active sites make a significant contribution to the enhanced electrochemical activity, and hybridizing cobalt oxide with cobalt pyrophosphates and carbon can result in enhanced OER performance through synergistic catalysis. Among all nanostructures, the obtained microspherical CoPO@C/NF-3 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, affording an anodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 293 mV for OER and 93 mV for HER, with good long-time stability. This work offers a practical route for engineering the high-performance electrocatalysts towards efficient energy conversion and storage devices.",
