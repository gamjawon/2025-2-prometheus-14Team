PERRICHON, M. PIJOLAT and M. PRIMET Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2, avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex (France) Summary The hydrogenation of CO and CO; over iron-alumina catalyst has been investigated using in situ infrared spectroscopy. Experiments were performed in static or dynamic conditions between 200 and 275 C, and under 1 or 14 bars pressure. At 1 bar, hydrocarbons, formates and carboxylates were the main species observed. A detailed study was made of their reactivity towards H; by using hydrogen TPR. The results show that these species are adsorbed on alumina and cannot be considered as intermediates, even if some methane can be produced from carboxylate hydrogenation. Under 14 bars, the species detected by IR are identical. Moreover, there is evidence of the existence of metallic iron on the surface during the reaction. It is proposed that due to the joint effect of high pressure and moderate temperature, molecular CO can exist on the surface, and may be directly hydrogenated to methanol or be inserted into a growing hydrocarbon chain, thus leading to homologous alcohols. Introduction In the CO and CO; hydrocondensation reactions, the surface carbon mechanism has received strong support in the past decades [1-3] as being responsible for the hydrocarbon formation. However, oxygenated com- pounds are produced in industrial Fischer^Tropsch synthesis [4], and in our laboratory it was recently observed that on an iron-alumina catalyst homologous alcohols can be obtained under ~ 10 bars pressure with a selectivity as high as 60% [5]. It is thus important to determine whether, under these higher pressure conditions, oxygen-containing intermediates are present on the iron surface. For such a study, infrared (IR) spectro- scopy is a unique tool. Since the paper of Biyholder and Neff [6], there have been several IR studies of CO or CO; hydrogenation using catalysts based on Group VIII metals [7-11]. For iron catalysts, these studies have been limited to room temperature conditions [12 -14] except for the work 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 208 of King [8] on Fe/Si02. Therefore, the objective of our study was to charac- terize the species present on the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, i.e., in the presence of CO + H^ or CO; + H; at atmospheric or higher pres- sure, and to test their reactivity towards hydrogen in order to examine if they are possible intermediates in alcohol formation. Experimental The Fe/Al;>03 catalyst, prepared by a precipitation method [15], con- tains a nominal 10 wt.% metal. After reduction under hydrogen at 600 C, the dispersion of metallic iron is about 3-4% [16]. The BET area of the alumina (Degussa Oxyd C) represents 97% of the total area of the reduced solid (100 m2 g~1). The Fe/Al203 catalytic activity in the atmospheric pres- sure hydrogenation of CO or CO^ into hydrocarbons has been previously described [17,18]. The IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer (IFS 110) with a quartz cell, which allowed work under dynamic conditions at atmospheric pressure. Preliminary experiments in the static mode were realised using a Digilab FT-IR apparatus (FTS 14). For the two spectrom- eters, the practical resolution was equal to 4 cm\"1. The in situ spectra under pressure (14 bars) were obtained using a stainless steel IR cell built in the laboratory and equipped with KBr windows. A special device allowed high- temperature reduction in the cell, outside of the beam. All the experiments were made with pressed wafers (P = 2 torr cm\"2) of about 25 mg catalyst. Spectra were measured at the reaction temperature. However, under static conditions and for a few experiments under pressure, they were recorded at 25 C after cooling to room temperature, which may result in the trapping of gaseous products on the catalyst. The reactivity towards hydrogen of the species adsorbed on the catalyst during the reaction was measured using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). TPR runs were performed in a catalytic reactor at atmospheric pressure. After 20 h of H2 + CO or H, + COz reaction at 200, 225, 250 or 275 C, the catalyst (m = 400 mg) was cooled to room temperature under the reaction mixture and then heated under H^ flow up to 600 C at 1 C min\"' heating rate. The products were periodically analysed using gas chromatography. Infrared results for the (H^ + CO) reaction Interaction ofH-i + CO with the catalyst between 25 and 250 C A preliminary experiment was performed under static conditions, all the spectra being recorded at room temperature. After reduction of the sample at 600 C and evacuation at 25 C, the H2 + CO mixture is introduced in the cell (P = 100 torr). Two bands are observed at 2040 and 2008 cm~1 209 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 --.-1 3200 3000 2800 -1 Fig. I.

Fig. 2. Spectra of C H bands for the interaction of V.i + CO over Fe/Al203, static condi- tions; samples a, b, c, d, e same treatment as in Fig. 1. (Fig. 1, spectrum b) which can be attributed to CO molecularly bonded to metallic iron [12,13]. Different environments of the CO molecules (H6\", O2\", ...) can account for the presence of these two bands. When the cata- lyst is heated, these bands vanish progressively, which can be interpreted as the disappearance of metallic iron on the surface. Above 150 C a set of new bands appears between 1800 and 1200 cm\"1. They can be assigned to a formate structure (1595, 1395 and 1380 cm\"1) and to acetate or pos- sibly homologous carboxylates (1580 and 1460 cm-1) [7, 9,19]. At 200 C there is a mixture of the two species. When the temperature is increased to 250 C, the intensity of the formate bands decreases, whereas that of the acetate increases (spectrum e). A similar experiment performed on the alumina support alone shows evidence of formate species after heating at 100 C. However, acetates are not observed, even after interaction at 250 C. This proves that their forma- tion requires the presence of iron. Figure 2 represents the hydrocarbon C H stretch region during the same experiment. At lower temperatures (150 C) the main feature is the appearance of a major band at 2930 cm~1 together with a set of bands at 3020, 2960 and 2860 cnr1. With increasing temperature, these three bands become more important. The 3020 cm~1 band is due to methane (associated with 1305 cm~1) in the gas phase, as evidenced by evacuating the cell, whereas the other three bands can be assigned to the CH vibration of the CH3 and CH2 groups of hydrocarbon chains [8 -10]. 210 0 5 10 15 Time(hr ) Fig. 3.

H^ + CO reaction at atmospheric pressure In order to follow the development of the different species under actual reaction conditions, the experiment was performed under a flow of H^ + CO with the same space velocity (1300 h~1) as used in the catalytic runs [17, 18]. Unfortunately, due to the greater volume of the IR cell, it was not pos- sible to rapidly obtain the expected H^/CO ratio. Therefore the time scales between catalytic tests and IR data are different; however, that should not change the conclusions of the IR study. The reaction temperature was 225 C. From the beginning of the reac- tion, a rapid decrease in the transmission occurred, due to the volume of iron carbiding, in agreement with Mossbauer spectroscopy results [20]. No CO carbonyl could be observed, whereas the main bands were those corre- sponding to formates and acetates as in static conditions. The evolution of their optical density is shown in Fig. 3. They appear simultaneously and reach a plateau after about 13 h reaction. In the CH region, the methane band is still observed (Fig. 4) but to a limited extent. The set of bands at 2960, 2930 and 2860 cm\"1 has prac- tically disappeared with a new band arising at 2910 cm\"1. It seems normal that the frequencies corresponding to CHa and CH2 groups of the hydro- carbons are not detected, since they are certainly in low concentration under our experimental conditions (T= 225 C and flow regime). The 2910 cm~1 absorption is at a lower wavenumber than that of CH; groups in saturated hydrocarbons (v = 2930 cm~1). In agreement with other works [9], it can be assigned to the CH stretching vibration of a formate species adsorbed on the catalyst. This is supported by the fact that the evolution of the optical density of this band is quite similar to that of the formates (Fig. 3), and it is even more evident in the H, + CO^ reaction (Fig. 5). Additional proof is given by the fact that this 2910 cm\"! band is not observed with an Fe/SiO; catalyst in a similar experiment where no formate or acetate species could be detected. 211 3100 3000 2900 2800 cm >-^ ; 150' ^ S 100-^ ' 50- ^ ^. . b d < su .*:0. re ' 0 \" 1 S 10 15 0 5 10 15 Time (hr ) Fig. 4.

H-i + CO reaction under 14 bars pressure The reaction of H; + CO was performed in the IR cell under static con- ditions at 14 bars pressure. The temperature was progressively increased from 150 to 295 C. The main conclusions can be stated as follows: The behaviours of the formate and acetate species are completely analogous with the results obtained at 1 bar. No oxygen-containing species other than those mentioned before could be detected, in particular no acyi, hydroxycarbene, or alkoxy species. Due to the high CO pressure, the IR absorption is very intense in the carbonyl region and no observation could be made during the reaction of possible CO adsorbed on the surface. However, after cooling and lowering the pressure to 1 bar at room temperature, molecular CO bonded to the metal (v(CO) = 2025 cm~1) was observed after a test at 295 C and 14 bars, whereas such CO was not detected in a similar test at 1 bar. This implies the presence of a more reduced surface under pressure. During the reaction the water-cooled cell windows trap heavy hydro- carbons; thus the recorded spectra are less precise and the data in the CH region cannot be considered conclusive. Infrared results for the H^ + CO^ reaction Interaction of H^ + CO, with the catalyst between 25 and 250 C The results, already been presented in [18], can be summarized as follows: hydrogeno carbonates (v = 1650,1450 and 1230 cm\"1) linked to the support are formed at room temperature, and molecular CO bonded to the metal is formed as well. These species gradually disappear upon heating. After treatment at 250 C, formates are the only observed species. They are not created when C02 alone is used in place of H2 + COs. 212 H^ + CO-i reaction at atmospheric pressure Upon introduction in the cell of H; + CO; at 225 C under flowing con- ditions, formate bands appeared and increased in intensity up to a limit reached after about 15 h reaction. The same evolution was observed for methane in the gas phase and for the 2910 cm~1 band (CH vibration of formates). It must be noted that no band corresponding to acetates was observed. After 20 h at 225 C, the temperature was raised to 250 C and main- tained during 2 h, then raised to 275 C and maintained for 20 h. The evolu- tion of the optical density at this temperature for each main band is pre- sented in Fig. 5. Whilst the intensity of formate species slightly decreases (curves a, b, d), a pair of bands at 1580 and 1460 cm\"1, attributed to acetates, appears and their intensity increases with time. This observation must be related to the fact that at this temperature, hydrocondensation of CO occurs in place of that of CO; [18]. The evolution of methane is different, since it goes through a maximum, and must be related to activity changes and aging of the catalyst [18]. TPR of Fe/Al203 catalysts after H^ + CO or H; + CO; reaction In order to clarify the stability and the reactivity of the different species present on the catalyst, we carried out hydrogen TPR experiments on samples after 20 h of Hz + CO or H; + CO; reaction at 200, 225, 250 and 275 C. The main TPR products were methane and water. Except for CO and CO;, no other oxygenated compounds were detected. -04 hydrocarbons were also analyzed to a much lesser extent, with temperature peaks close to that of CH4. After TPR up to 600 C, chemical analysis indicated a very low concentration of unreacted carbon, which was nearly identical in all cases (Table 1). The TPR spectra of water are shown in Fig. 6. They can be resolved into two distinct peaks, noted aH;0 and ^H;0, at about 250 and 350 C. If the synthesis is carried out at 275 C (spectra d), the aH^O peak is absent, suggesting that the corresponding species do not exist at this temperature. The areas under the peaks were estimated and the values are given in Table 1. In spite of the rough approximation, this table shows that in the H; + CO reaction, the |3H;0 area is higher than the aH^O area (ratio 2), whereas in the H; + CO; reaction the opposite situation is observed. Concerning the origin of water, it must be noted that TPR with an Fe/SiOz sample (20 h, H; + CO;, 225 C) gives no water peak when IR detects no formates and no homologous carboxylates. Moreover, if H; is replaced by He for carrying out the corresponding TPD on Fe/Al203, the desorbing products are essentially CO and CO; (plus traces of CH4). There- fore we can conclude that in the TPR experiments, water is formed from the reduction of oxygenated species. By coupling TPR and IR experiments, it 213 TABLE 1 Values of the area of the TPR peaks for catalyst after 20 h reaction\" T (reaction) 200 C 226 C 250 C 275 C Hz+CO aH^O 10 30 0 ?0 20 70 CH4 620 480 680 residual C 60 40 40 Hz + CC>2 aHzO 60 501' 90 0 <3H,0 10 601' 50 30 CH4 90 300 250 330 residual C 50 40 40 40 a Units = limol per 400 mg catalyst. b Resolution into two peaks is difficult. 200 300 400 500 200 300 400 500 Temperature ( C) 100 200 300 400 Temperature C C) Fig. 6.

Therefore we attribute the origin of the a. and jSHzO peaks to the successive reduction of these two species. The spectra concerning methane are presented in Fig. 8. Generally speaking, they are constituted of a single peak, often broad and asymmetric. In one case (H; + CO;, 275 C) two peaks are distinctly observed. Upon rais- ing the reaction temperature (200 - 275 C), the methane peak increases from 280 to 360 (and 410 C) with the N2 + CO reaction, and from 250 to 310 C with the H2 + CO^ reaction. It should be noted that methane is formed at a lower temperature for this last reaction. The quantities calculated under the CH4 curves are given in Table 1. They are more important for the H; + CO reaction and greater than the 214 200 300 400 500 200 300 400 Temperature l C) Fig. 8.

If we suppose that after 20 h of synthesis the iron carbide formed has the stoichiometry Fe^C, which is nearly ob- tained after 20 h of Hz + CO synthesis at 250 C, its total hydrogenation would lead to 330 Jumol CH4 which is insufficient to explain all the measured quantities. In fact, each peak can be broken down into several peaks. This can be more effectively observed for the less-carbided catalyst. For example, after 1 h reaction at 225 C under H; + CO 2, the methane TPR spectrum presents three distinct peaks at 180, 240 and 330 C. As carbiding and aging progress, the carbon hydrogenation peak becomes broader and predominant, and overlaps the peaks from other species. In fact, the origins of the peaks due to CH4 are numerous; the following ones can be considered: (i) superficial carbon, easily hydrogenated; (ii) bulk carbide; (iii) superficial carbon, less hydrogenable, partly responsible for catalyst aging; (iv) formate and carboxylate species; (v) hydrogenolysis of adsorbed hydrocarbon chains, which also explains the formation of CyC^ in small quantities simultaneous to the formation of CH4. These hypotheses are in agreement with previous works [21, 22] show- ing the presence of different types of carbonaceous species at the surface of a working catalyst. Discussion A summary of the IR and TPR results is given in Table 2. It is clear that the presence of these species on the catalyst surface does not necessarily mean that they are intermediates in the hydrocarbon or alcohol synthesis. Some of them are formed on the support even in the absence of iron. How- ever they can be hydrogenated in the presence of metal atoms. In the follow- ing discussion, we concentrate on mechanisms of formation of the oxygen- ated products and we consider successively the possible role of the species put in evidence by IR in the reaction schemes. 215 TABLE 2 Summary of IR and TPR results Frequency Formula (cm-') Type Temperature, Temperature, Reactivity Remarks H; + CO Hz + CO; CO ( C) 2040 2008 CO molecular 25-150 adsorbed CO on Fe 25 (shift 1970- -100 to 1940 c m-1) Observable at 21 C after a test at 295 C under 14 bars 1650 1450 1230 HC03- hydrogeno-carbonate 25 -250 Formed also on A1203 alone 2910 1595 1395 1375 HCO,- formates 150 - 300 150 -300 At 250 C, leads to CH^ and H^O formation Formed also on Al^Oa alone 1580 1460 CHaCO;-RCHzCO;- acetates 200 - 275 carboxylates 250 - 275 (not at the beginning of the reaction) At 350 C, leads to CHf and H;0 formation 3015 1305 CH4 >150 >150 2960 2930 2860 CH3 CH; CH; hydrocarbon > 150 chains >150 Observed mainly under static conditions Carboxylate species During the reaction there is a development of formates and acetates bonded to the support. The formate formation is easily explained by the interaction of a CO molecule with hydroxyls of the support, either ini- tially present or created on alumina by adsorption of the water of reaction. The formation of homologous carboxylates is not so evident. Despite the fact that no alkoxide species could be detected by IR, it can be ex- plained by two successive reactions: R-CHaOH + A1-0-A1 and R-CHz-O Al + 2C>Ai - R-CH2-0 + OH Al Al R-CO 0 A1 + H,0 This reaction scheme is quite possible, considering the oxidizing properties of alumina [23]. However, the fact that acetates are observed in the H; + CO; reaction only when CO participates in the synthesis also suggests the 216 possibility of a CO insertion in a methoxy species which has already been proposed [24]. This cannot be excluded, even if such an insertion has never been observed in classical organic reactions. All these considerations are in agreement with the proposal that car- boxy late species are secondary products. This is supported by the fact that their quantity increases during the reaction whilst the catalyst activity de- creases. Their participation in product formation is more questionable. The formates are the most reactive species, and are hydrogenated to CI-U above 250 C. Thus they may participate to some extent in the methane formation. Under pressure, the methanol production drops drastically at 250 C, in the H2 + CO as well as in the H; + CO; reactions. However, under pressure, hydrogenation reactions are favoured and the transformation of formates into methane will be enhanced. Note also that formates can play an impor- tant role in the activity of the catalyst for the H; + CO; reaction and for the reverse of the water-gas shift reaction [18]. As for the homologous carboxylates, it is clear that under the usual reaction conditions (200 - 275 C) they are not hydrogenated to hydro- carbons and oxygenated products. Hydrocarbon chains Hydrocarbon chains are observed by IR spectroscopy mainly when the reaction is performed under static conditions, after cooling to room temper- ature. In a flow regime, their observation in smaller quantities rules out the possibility of long chain carboxylates and must be related to the presence of hydrocarbons in the gas phase or in slight interaction with the catalyst. CO carbonyl species The carburization of Fe/A^Oa catalysts during the H2 + CO reaction is well established [20]. Simultaneously, a decrease in the catalytic activity during this reaction was observed [17]. Thus, the observation of a CO car- bonyl band after a test under pressure reveals the presence of a more reduced iron surface, and consequently of a greater number of active sites, which accounts for the higher activity observed under pressure. But additionally, the existence of non-dissociated CO on the surface may be related to the ability of this catalyst to produce homologous alcohols under pressure. It may be supposed that at moderate temperatures, pressure would stabilize adsorbed CO in a molecular form, thus inhibiting its dissociation into active carbon. Its direct hydrogenation would lead to methanol, whereas homol- ogous alcohols would be formed by the insertion of this non-dissociated CO into a growing hydrocarbon chain and the further fast hydrogenation of the acyi species thus created. Unfortunately our IR results could not detect such a species, which would have brought the necessary support to our proposal. 217 Conclusions In Fischer-Tropsch catalysis, it is extremely difficult to identify the real intermediates for the numerous products formed. The present IR results show effectively that most of the observed species (hydrogenocarbonates, carboxylates, hydrocarbons) result from the adsorption of reactants and products on the support. As for the processes leading to oxygenated prod- ucts, it has not been possible to identify a specific reaction pathway. How- ever our results are in favour of the existence of a non-dissociated CO entity on the iron surface as an intermediate for the alcohol production, via an acyi species too reactive to be observed.

Primet Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2, avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne CédexFrance The hydrogenation of CO and CO2 over iron-alumina catalyst has been investigated using in situ infrared spectroscopy. Experiments were performed in static or dynamic conditions between 200 and 275 °C, and under 1 or 14 bars pressure. At 1 bar, hydrocarbons, formates and carboxylates were the main species observed. A detailed study was made of their reactivity towards H2 by using hydrogen TPR. The results show that these species are adsorbed on alumina and cannot be considered as intermediates, even if some methane can be produced from carboxylate hydrogéation. Under 14 bars, the species detected by IR are identical. Moreover, there is evidence of the existence of metallic iron on the surface during the reaction. It is proposed that due to the joint effect of high pressure and moderate temperature, molecular CO can exist on the surface, and may be directly hydrogenated to methanol or be inserted into a growing hydrocarbon chain, thus leading to homologous alcohols.
