Einstein, Mfi26 Vilieiirhitinif Cedex, Freiner Received 12 April 1996; accepted 23 Apri] 1996 Abstract The isomerisation of n-buiene into isobutene has been studied over a ferrierite catalyst being irs a selective state (aged catalyst) or non-selective state (fresh catalyst). It is observed, by using \\}C=C-C-C. thai a bimolecular process operates on the non-selective catalyst whereas a monomolecular process exists on the selective catalyst. 1. Introduction Isobutene is an important material needed for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl-ether) which is now used as an octane enhancer for unleaded gasoline. The major source of isobutene is from the catalytic cracking of petroleum and a recent patent [1] and recent reports [2,3] have shown that ferrierite-based catalysts are effective to transform n-butene into isobutene. Ferrierite, a natural or synthetic material, has an orthorhombic framework containing ten- membered (4.2 X 5.4 A) channels intersected by o eight-membered (3.5 X 4.8 A) channels. It is generally observed that ferrierite cata- lysts are not selective at the beginning of the reaction and that the selectivity increases with time-on-stream, reaching high values after a few hours. This behaviour is illustrated on Fig. 1 Corresponding author. relative to commercial ferrierite from Tosoh. This ferrierite (Si/Al = 9.5) is formed of small elliptical grains having sizes in the range of 2-40 (im as observed by SEM. On Fig. 1, the change in isobutene selectivity and isobutene yield are plotted as a function of time-on-stream. The exact nature of the active site and its location, are still under debate [4] and the reac- tion mechanism is not established. As for chlo- rinated alumina which is also active and selec- tive for the isomerisation of n-butenes into isobutene [5], it has been postulated that bute cou be transformed into isobutene either via a bimolecular reaction (oligomerisation and crack- ing producing C.^ +.;-C.^ , C^ +C,^) or a monomolecular reaction (isomerisation). For a ferrierite catalyst in its selective state (zone B of Fig. 1), it is observed that the isobutene selectivity changes with the bute pressure and the reaction temperature, this is interpreted to be in favour of the monomolecu- lar reaction mechanism [6]. 1381-1169/96/S15 00 Copyright 1996 Elsevicr Science B.V.

Experimental 'C enriched butane (99%. \"C-C-C-O has been obtained from CEA (FRANCE). In order to obtain butes from butane, the dehydrogena- tion of the labelled butane has been performed in a static reactor containing a Pt catalyst [7] highly selective and stable for the dehydrogena- tion of light alkanes. Reactant (butane) and products (butes) were then trapped in a cold finger at 77 K and the hydrogen formed was removed. Then the mixture (butane, 60% and butes 40%. 50 Torr) was introduced in a static reactor (17 ml) loaded with 100 mg of the ferrierite catalyst which is in its selective state (catalyst of Fig. I. /.one B). The reactants were analy/.ed by gas chromatography and mass spec- a b c Fig. 2. Bulene analysis by yas rhromalugraphy (left part) and mass analysis (right part), (a) Reactanl.

Results and discussion Fig, 2a indicates that with the unreacted bu- tane, there is a mixture of 1-bute. 2-butene P. Mrniuidvaii el ut./Journal nfMolecular Catalysis A: Chemical 110(IWfi> L177-L17V L179 (cis and turns) having only one '^C' atom per molecule, this '^C atom being randomly dis- tributed. In addition to that, traces of isobutene are observed. These tiny traces of isobutene are probably formed on the dehydrogenation cata- lyst via: pi PI butane isobutane -isobutene + H ^ When the labelled bute is reacted with the catalyst, isobutene may be formed cither via a monomolecular process (through a cyclo- propane intermediate) and by consequence will have only one '\"'C atom or via a bimolecular mechanism: + + c C-C-C-C - C-C-C=C *=C-C-C-C-C-C-C ^ C-C-C-C-C-C--C (each C^ molecular containing two '^C atoms) The 3 MC y is isomerized rapidly into a mixture of MC 7, DMC(, and TMC.,. Thus, the two '^C atoms will randomly distributed in these Cmolecules. The next step, the cracking reac- tion will transform the C^ molecule either into two molecules: The same reaction mixture has been reacted, in another experiment, on the femerite catalyst being in the non-selective state (state A, Fig. 1). The results of Fig. 2c clearly indicate that the isobutene formed is a mixture of molecules containing two '^C atoms (mass number 58), one ''C atom (mass number 57) and no '\"^C atom (mass number 56) the relative distribution being 1/2/1. It will be of interest to know how the selec- tivity is modified as a function of time-on- stream: different factors could be at the origin of this modification: S. poisoning of the non-selective sites 2. decrease in the pore dimensions by coke deposits defavoring bimolecular reaction 3. creation of selective isomerisation sites due to coke deposit [4] These change in isobutene selectivity as a function of time-on-stream will be discussed in a different paper. Thus. from this study it appears that the transformation of butes over a selective fer- rierite catalyst is occurring via a monomolecular mechanism but by contrast on a non-selective fen-ierite catalyst, a bimoleculir mechanism is operating. (eg C-C-C=C-C-C -> C=C-C + C-C=C-C) c c c or into C-^ +C^ References (eg C-C-C=C-C-C -r C=C-C - C=C-C-C) c c c These cracked products (i-C^^ , ^ , C^ and C,_) will have zero, one or two '^C atoms. The analysis of the products (Fig. 2b) indi- cates that indeed part of butes are isomerised into isobutene and that isobutene contains only one ' C atom clearly indicating that on the selective catalyst, the isobutene formation is occurring via a monomolecular mechanism.
