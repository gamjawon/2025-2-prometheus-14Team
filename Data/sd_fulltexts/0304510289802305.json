The concentration of H;0 in aqueous H^O; was shown to be a main factor determining the chemoselectivity for the allylic alcohol oxidation. Low concentrations of HyO^ (i.e. a large amount of H;0) favored dehydro- genation to form a,^-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, while higher H^Oa concentrations favored epoxidation. Oxidation of allylic alcohols can potentially occur either by epoxida- tion or dehydrogenation [1-3]. However, metal catalysts for dehydrogena- tion have not been as highly developed as similar epoxidation catalysts [4-6]. In the course of studying oxidation catalysis using transition metal- peroxide systems [7 -12], we found that H^O in aqueous H^O; played an important role in determining the chemoselectivity of allylic alcohol oxida- tion; higher amounts of H;0 favor dehydrogenation at the expense of epoxidation. In the case of alkylhydroperoxides, there are few reports concerning the H20 effect on metal-catalyzed oxidations [13-16]. Although there are many studies on the oxidation of organic compounds with transition metal- aqueous H^Oa systems, we are unaware of studies on the effect of HjO in the H20; oxidant [17]. This paper therefore examines the function of the H;0 molecule in relation to the reaction mechanism for the dehydrogenation. The oxidation of various allylic alcohols was carried out using transition metal compounds in the presence of fl-sQ-i- Typical results are shown in Table 1. Using the TiOCacac^-H^O; system, many allylic alcohols were oxidized by dehydrogenation to the corresponding a,^-unsaturated ketone or aldehyde products. Increasing the number of alkyi substituents on the olefinic carbons decreased the ratio of the dehydrogenation product to the epoxidation product (Runs 1, 5, 6 and 7).

Cycloocten-3-ol, a medium-sized ring allylic alcohol, did not yield any oxidation products. It is known from studies of the autoxidation of Cg-cyclic olefins that oxidation products derived from radical abstraction of allylic hydrogens are obtained in low yields, with formation of small amounts of epoxides, because the allylic radical in such systems cannot easily achieved maximum overlap of p and TT orbitals [18]. This result supports the idea that these metal-catalyzed dehydrogenations have a radical character (vide infra). Benzylic hydroxyl groups as well as allylic ones can be also oxidized; 1-phenylethanol gave acetophenone. It should be noted that the dehydrogenation is characteristic to titanium catalysts in the presence of aqueous fl'fl^ oxidant. In the case of ^uOOH, addition of H-fl depressed the rate of epoxy alcohol formation without giving carbonyl compounds [13, 14]. No significant differences in chemoselectivity were observed among titanium catalysts of Ti0(acac)2, Ti(0'Pr)4 and Cp2TiCl2. Other transition metal catalyst systems, e.g. VO(acac)2-H2C>2 and Mo02(acac)2-H202 in the place of the titanium catalysts, gave selectively epoxy alcohols (Runs 3 and 4). This is compatible with the following reactivity order for allylic alcohol epoxidation using ^uOOH as an oxidant: V > Mo > Ti [4]. 203 Fig. 1. Plots of ratio of initial formation rates for dehydrogenation (Vdehydro) snd epox- idation (Vepo) vs- HzO^ concentrations. Reaction conditions: 2-methyl-2-penten-4-ol 2 mmol, Ti02(acac)2 0.02 mmol, H^Oa 6 mmol, solvent 10 ml. 0 THF (40 C), dioxan (40 C), C dioxan (60 C), a CHaCN (40 C). The amount of tl^O in the HzO; oxidant remarkably influences the product selectivity; increasing the H 30 concentration increases initial forma- tion rates of the carbonyl compounds (Vdehydro) while decreasing those of the epoxy alcohol (Vepo)- These results for 2-methyl-2-penten-4-ol are shown in Fig. 1. All three solvents dioxan, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, which make homogeneous solutions with aqueous H-fl^, exhibited a similar depen- dence of the product selectivity of Vdehydro/^epo on H-fl concentration. The reaction at 40 C showed higher selectivity for the carbonyl compounds than at 60 C; lowering the reaction temperature to 20 C led to extremely slow oxidation rates. In order to determine whether the present dehydrogenation has a radical or ionic character, the rates of oxidation of a series of p-substituted 1-phenylethanols were determined and correlated with a Hammet plot. A small p-value of 0.06 at 40 C was measured. Addition of a radical scavenger, 2,6-di-tBu-p-cresol, to the reaction medium hardly affected the rate of dehydrogenation of allylic alcohols. Thus this titanium-catalyzed oxidation does not have a free radical nature. The intermediacy of oxo (Ti=0) and peroxo (TiO;) species could be excluded because the reaction of TiO(TPP) or TiO^fTPP) (TPP= tetraphenylporphyrino) with allylic alcohols in the absence of H^Oa gave no oxidation products even at 80 C. From deuterium- labeled experiments using 1-deuterio-l-phenylethanol, a kinetic isotope effect of kfilk-o = 2.2 was observed at 40 C. This suggests that the rate- determining step in the dehydrogenation involves the a-hydrogen abstraction of alcohols. 204 Dehydrogenation /L / 0^-^.0^ 20 . \\ ^ \\- \"^O-fQ; OH 0 ''f/ fn 1 11 . ^i V.

Alternative pathway for dehydrogenation and epoxidation. Here, we wish to propose that a titanium-hydroperoxide (Ti OOH) acts as a common active species for both the dehydrogenation and epoxida- tion [5]. The dehydrogenation proceeds via the homolytic splitting of the 0 0 bond in the peroxide, while the epoxidation via the heterolytic splitting of the bond (Fig. 2) [18]. According to this hypothesis, a possible role of HaO in the titanium-H^Oz catalyst systems would be as follows: (1) coordination of H^O to a titanium center to decrease its Lewis acidity; and (2) clustering of V.^0 molecules on a cationic oxygen of Ti OOH. In both cases, the electrophilicity of the cationic oxygen of the peroxide would be lowered. This would diminish the amount of epoxidation. Dehydrogenation could then prevail. In the oxidation of allylic alcohols using transition metal-peroxide sys- tems, epoxidation is a more facile reaction than dehydrogenation. In order to design efficient metal catalyst systems for the selective dehydrogenation of allylic alcohols, lowering the electrophilicity of an oxygen atom proximal to the metal in a metal-peroxide active species is a crucial factor.
