Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Received 21 March 1997; received in revised form 12 July 1997; accepted 14 July 1997 Abstract A series of H-ZSM-5 catalysts with a varying Si/A1 ratio, varying particle size and varying substitution (Fe for A1) has been studied in skeletal isomerisation of n-butene in continuous flow experiments. The various H-ZSM-5 catalysts which, unlike the other 10-membered ring molecular sieves, show a very low selectivity at standard conditions, have been used under modified reaction conditions. After changes on the catalyst, and under optimised conditions ZSM-5 showed rather high selectivity and yield of isobutene. The just mentioned modifications were suggested on basis of the knowledge on the mechanism of skeletal isomerisation and of the accompanying side reactions. ~, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, one step in the MTBE synthesis, the pro- duction of isobutene, forms a bottle-neck. Therefore, skeletal isomerisation of n-butene to isobutene has been studied intensively in the last few years [1-12]. In spite of all effort, the maximum yield of isobutene reached with contemporary catalysts is still low and novel catalysts are needed. A rational design of new catalysts and improvement of existing ones should be based on the knowledge of the mechanism. It has been recently established that the skeletal isomerisation of n-butene (unlike that of n- *Corresponding author.

Therefore, dimerisation has to be suppressed. This can be achieved in four ways: 1. by a high shape selectivity--the pore diameter of the 10-membered ring molecular sieves does not allow a formation of some branched dimers. For example, trimethylpentenes probably cannot be formed at all [5,13,14], and the formation of dimethylhexenes is strongly restricted as well [5,14,15]. Since dimers can be still formed on the outer surface, crystals should be large (i.e. with a relatively large inner surface) or with the deacti- vated outer surface, 2. by using a higher reaction temperature---dimerisa- tion is a reaction disfavoured at higher tempera- tures. While almost all isobutene dimerises to 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ~'; 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00225- 1 444 J. Hou~vi6ka et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 165 (1997) 443-449 trimethylpentenes at room temperature, amount of dimers formed at 700-800 K is negligible [5,16]. 3. by a lower partial pressure of the reactant--butene. 4. by using catalysts of moderate acidity--skeletal isomerisation runs on BrCnsted acid sites of mod- erate or high acidity. However, very strongly acidic OH groups induce too much dimerisation thus their presence leads to a high by-product formation [6,8,17]. The knowledge summarised in the above mentioned points has been applied in this paper to improve the selectivity of the ZSM-5 catalyst, which up to now has been generally considered as a non-selective catalyst. The only zeolitic materials successfully used up to now for skeletal isomerisation of n-butene are the 10- membered ring molecular sieves [18]. The unique performance of these materials is based on the shape selectivity (the first point mentioned above). However, not all the 10-membered ring sieves are good catalysts. The 10-membered ring channels of heulandite, for example, have an oval shape and they are too narrow for isobutene. The low selectivity of ZSM-5 and ZSM- 11 is due to large cavities formed in the place of intersections of the 10-membered ring channels. Cav- ities offer enough space for extended dimerisation and the by-products formation. ZSM-5 is otherwise very resistant against coking. If its selectivity could be increased by the suppression of dimerisation, ZSM- 5 would be an attractive catalyst for skeletal isomer- isation of n-butene, because of its high stability and its availability. Catalysts used for skeletal isomerisation of n- butene often suffer from an intensive carbon deposits formation and a low catalytic stability. Non-micro- porous materials deactivate in several hours. Zeolites survive longer on stream. However even the best one- dimensional channel structure molecular sieve SAPO 11, tested by us, still lost 25% of its activity in 100 h on stream. A very stable catalyst is ferrierite. Patent [1] reports that the isobutene yield is 42.1% still after 336 h on stream. In this case, the high stability is probably due to the two-dimensional channel struc- ture. ZSM-5 has a similar, three-dimensional struc- ture, so a high stability can be also expected. Up to now, ZSM-5 was considered in literature as a very unselective catalyst [17,19,20]. By this study, we made an attempt to increase its selectivity while preserving the high stability. Since the shape selectivity of ZSM-5 is insufficiently high, the three other possibilities mentioned above (points 2 to 4) have been explored in the attempt to improve the catalyst's properties. 2. Experimental Zeolites H-[A1]ZSM-5 with the particle size of about 1 ktm were obtained from the PQ Corporation. Silicon/aluminium ratio of various materials tested was 25, 75, 140, 600 and 1000. The characterisation of these catalysts is published elsewhere [21]. The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 molecular sieves were synthe- sised according to [22] with a small modification. Since Ludox, silicon source used in [22], contains aluminium impurities, it was replaced in the synthesis by tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). For example, when iron containing molecular sieve was synthesised, 39.2 g TEOS was dropwise added into the solution of 0.325 g Fe(NO3)3.9H20, 58 ml water and 3.2 g sulphuric acid. After 2 h of stirring, the third solution consisting of 4.8 g tetrapropylammonium bromide, 1 g NaOH and 15 ml water, was added. The final pH was adjusted to 9 by the NaOH solution in water. The sieve crystallised after 3 days at 447 K. Na- [Fe]ZSM-5 was detemplated and exchanged into a hydrogen form. The final material obtained was white. In this study, catalysts with Si/Fe ratio 200-1000 were synthesised. The large crystals of H-[A1]ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesised in the same way as just described for H- [Fe]ZSM-5. A12(SO4)3.18H20 was used as an alumi- nium source. All catalysts were characterised by XRD (Philips PW 1730) and electron microscopy. H- [Ga]ZSM-5 samples were prepared by R. Klik, UFCH Prague (direct synthesis, Si/Ga ratio =25, 75, 860, crystal size about 1 ~tm). To modify the acidic properties H-[A1]ZSM-5 with Si/AI ratio 1000 (the PQ Corporation product) was treated by trimethyl phosphite [23]. In this prepara- tion, 2 g of pre-dried zeolite were refluxed over night in a solution of 16 ml octane and 1.5 ml trimethyl phosphite. The ZSM-5 treated in this way was washed three times with 20 ml of dichloromethane and then calcined in oxygen at 713 K (heating rate 1 K min-1.). Acidity of H-ZSM-5 samples (as far as it is known) is discussed in [21]. J. I-lou2,vi(ka et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 165 (1997) 443-449 445 Catalytic tests were performed in continuous flow with a fixed bed reactor. The standard feed consisted of 5% n-butene (AGA GAS B.V. -99.4%) in nitrogen, the total flow was 20 ml min-~ and the total pressure used was about 1 bar. The product mixture was ana- lysed on line by gas chromatograph (HP 5890) equipped by a FID detector and a capillary column, filled by KCl-treated alumina. The data evaluation was as in [5-9]. The relative concentration of any compound in an effluent was defined by Eq. (1), where N is a GC signal (integrated peak area). This concentration (by some authors called yield, in the case of isobutene) can be taken as a measure of selectivity and, at low conversion, also of activity. The sum in the denominator comprises all gases detected by GC. Ci : [Ni/Z Ni] 100% (1) Conversion is defined by Eq. (2) (for more detailed information see [5]).

Results The aim of this study was to maximise the yield of isobutene, but to preserve the high catalytic stability of the original ZSM-5. Activity of all catalysts was measured in the conversion range as broad as possible, to find the highest possible yield (relative concentra- tion) of isobutene. Reaction conditions were modified to suppress the bimolecular mechanism. To this end, changes were introduced in the reaction temperature, acidity of catalyst, crystal size of catalysts and in the partial pressure of n-butene. The yield vs. conversion curves are shown in Fig. l for different reaction conditions and catalysts. Main products observed and the conversion at the maximum isobutene relative concentration, are shown in Table 1 Table 2. 30- 25- 20- 15- O 10- 5- 0~ 0 2'0 ,'0 6'0 8'o ,00 Conversion [%] Fig. 1. Yield of isobutene as a function of conversion for different ZSM-5 catalysts under different reaction conditions. Conditions are specified in Table 1. Catalysts codes are as in Table 1: II, catalyst 1; 0, catalyst 2; li, catalyst 3; V, catalyst 5; 0, catalyst 6. When n-butene has reacted over H-[A1]ZSM-5 under the standard reaction conditions at 623 K, the maximum isobutene yield is only about 13% and the selectivity is 16.5%. Under the same reaction condi- tions MAPO's and ferrierite catalysts reach a yield of 30-40%, or slightly more. When the reaction tem- perature is raised to 773 K, relative concentration of isobutene increases up to 22%. Reaction performed in pores is more selective than reaction on the outer surface of the same zeolite. Therefore, a use of crystals ten times larger than the standard ones used earlier (from 1 to 10gm) increases the maximum isobutene yield to 25%. Acid- ity of the catalyst can be modified in two ways: i) bridging OH groups are converted to moderately acidic P-OH groups by the reaction with trimethyl phosphite and calcination [23]; ii) aluminium in the lattice of ZSM-5 is replaced by iron which makes the bridging groups less acidic [24]. The first method (with trimethyl phosphite) is poorly reproducible and leads to slightly lower relative concentration of isobutene (25%) than the second one. H-[Fe]ZSM-5 yields 29% of isobutene under the optimum conver- sion. Partial pressure of n-butene is rather low already under standard reaction conditions (5 kPa). Therefore, only a small decrease of pressure, to 1 kPa, was tested. Relative concentration of isobutene obtained with H-[Fe]ZSM-5 was about 30% at the lower pressure. 446 J.

The yield of isobutene is higher than 30% for 130 h on stream (Fig. 2). When the Si/substitute ratio was equal or higher than 75, there were no differences in performance of a catalysts with a different aerial density of OH groups [21]. Product composition of butene reaction and the yield vs. conversion curve did not differ significantly over ZSM-5 with Si/Al=75 and ZSM-5 with Si/ AI=1000. At the same conversion, activity was how- ever related to the concentration of OH groups. H-[A1]ZSM-5 (Si/Al=25) was at 773 K slightly less selective than the other materials (isobutene yield 18%). At 623 K, all above mentioned catalysts (H- [A1]ZSM-5, H-[AI+TMP]ZSM-5, H-[Fe]ZSM-5, 30- 25- Z 20- == 15- 10- 0 f ~_- -. _ ,'0 20 6'0 \" 8'0 ' ,;0 ' ,~0 time-on-stream [hours] Fig. 2.

(Fig. 3). Under standard conditions, at 623 K, the ratio [(propene+pentenes)/isobutene] is between 2 and 3, over the whole conversion range (see Fig. 3). This value is very similar to the value which is obtained upon cracking of primary (in one step formed) dimers of butene [5], as one can see in Table 3. This also indicates that the main by-products (propene, pen- tenes) and most of isobutene are produced on ZSM-5 at low temperatures (623 K) by a bimolecular (dimer- isation) mechanism. Acidity of ZSM-5 can be modified in several ways. The first possibility is to substitute boron for alumi- nium. However, H-[B]ZSM-5 is so weakly acidic that the activity in skeletal isomerisation of n-butene is zero [21]. H-[Ga]ZSM-5 is too strongly acidic, so that the best results were so far obtained with H-[Fe]ZSM- 5. Replacement of bridging OH groups in H- [A1]ZSM-5 by P-OH groups using a reaction with Table 3 Octenes (saturated vapour pressure at 295 K) in nitrogen flow (20 ml/min) cracked over the H3PO4/SiO2 catalyst (1 g) at 713 K.

Although an increase in selectivity was always observed, sometimes it was accompanied with a severe loss of activity. 4. Discussion It seems to be well established that on selective catalysts skeletal isomerisation of n-butene to isobu- tene occurs mainly by a monomolecular mechanism [5-12]. At low conversion, by-products are mostly formed via a dimerisation, bimolecular mechanism, by which the C4-alkenes dimerise first to octenes and these octenes isomerise and crack to butenes, propene and pentenes. At high conversions, hydrogen transfer leading to alkanes, aromates and carbonaceous depos- its (catalyst is black after reaction) appears, too. Selectivity of the H-[A1]ZSM-5 is very low when tested under the same reaction conditions as those which allow a high selectivity to be achieved with ferrierite or MAPO's. This can be explained by an easy dimerisation in the place of intersection of channels in ZSM-5 (Fig. 4 in [17]). However, this catalyst never- theless shows a very high catalytic stability [ 18]. When the reaction conditions and composition of the ZSM-5 catalysts are modified to suppress dimer- isation (a higher reaction temperature, a lower partial pressure, a moderate catalyst acidity and a larger particle size), yield of isobutene increases from 13 to 30%. Obviously, dimerisation is responsible for by- products, namely for the formation of propene and pentenes. Hydrogen transfer reactions are influenced about .5.5A --t-F Fig. 4. Schematic picture of ZSM-5 channels intersection. 448 J. Hou~vi(ka et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 165 (1997) 443-449 much less by the mentioned changes. Although the stability of H-[Fe]ZSM-5 at 773 K is lower than that at 623 I( [18], catalyst's life is still very long. The yield of 30% isobutene is maintained for 130 h on stream. As already mentioned, dimerisation leading to by- products can be suppressed in four ways. From these, the shape selectivity is probably the most efficient way. While linear or mono-branched molecules like butene or isobutene can move relatively freely in channels of the 10-membered ring zeolites, formation of highly branched octenes is strongly suppressed there, if not impossible. This conclusion was con- firmed by catalytic [5,13,15], as well as by adsorption measurements [14]. The role of the shape selectivity can be demon- strated by a comparison of ferrierite and ZSM-5 catalysts. Under the same reaction conditions, ferrier- ite is a selective catalyst while the ZSM-5 selectivity is very poor [19,20]. Since both catalysts possess the same, very high acidity, the only difference between them, leading to the difference in selectivity, should be the channel structure [19]. The difference is very subtle, since both mentioned catalysts have intersec- tion cavities and only the size of intersections is smaller with ferrierite, but this difference is very important for the selectivity [19]. An increase in the reaction temperature can help when the shape selectivity is not sufficiently high. Our results (these partly shown in Fig. 1) show that about 1.4% of octenes are observed when n-butene reacts at 623 K (conversion 38.8%). At 773 K, under otherwise the same conditions (conversion 43.6%), only 0.43% of octenes is detected. The amount of C3 and C5 by- products decreases as the content of dimers does. As a result, initial selectivity increases from 27.4% to 68.8%. On the contrary, a significant decrease of a reaction temperature (under 600 K) would cause severe problems with selectivity. Not only butene dimerisation, but also dimerisation of isobutene and co-dimerisation take place. Formation of propene and pentenes from isobutene on the shape unselective H3POjSiO2 catalyst at 373 K (via trimethylpentenes) is very fast, compared to skeletal isomerisation of and to linear butenes [5]. However, reaction temperature cannot be elevated too much. Carbon deposition is faster at high tem- peratures and catalysts are then less catalytically stable. This is the case of ZSM-5 at 773 K. Thermo- dynamical equilibrium among butenes disfavours at high temperatures the desired reaction to isobutene, too. Butenes mixture in equilibrium contains about 80% of isobutene at 373 K, and only 45% at 713 K [5]. Therefore, an optimum reaction temperature should be a compromise among the above mentioned factors. A high reaction temperature (770 K) is a necessary condition to observe differences in selectivity among ZSM-5 crystals of different particle size and composi- tion. Aluminium and iron ZSM-5 catalysts, with a varying Si/substitute ratio and crystal size, are of about the same selectivity at 623 K. The ratio [(propene+ pentenes)/isobutene] is between 2 and 3 in the whole conversion range on all mentioned materials (Fig. 3), which is the value very similar to that obtained by cracking of dimers-2.5 (Table 3) [5]. It indicates that on ZSM-5 at 623 K the extent of a bimolecular mechanism (leading to by-products) is very large and modification in acidity and crystal size are not able to suppress this mechanism sufficiently. A decrease in partial pressure of n-butene (see Fig. 1) also leads to a higher selectivity. However, it is not efficient to use low partial pressures in an industrial process. Therefore, one has to investigate other possibilities. It seemed promising to investigate the effects of acidity strength. It is a common wisdom that cracking requires strong acidity and thus, the reverse reaction of dimerisation must require the same. On the other hand, a moderate acidity of the POH groups (phosphoric acid on silica [6] or MeAPO's [9]) is sufficient for activity in skeletal isomerisation. Therefore, a mod- ification in acidity of catalysts can be a more important way to suppress dimerisation. Acidity of molecular sieves can be varied in two ways: i) by different element composition of the lattice; ii) by replacing the bridging OH groups by other, less acidic groups. When various elements are used for synthesis of molecular sieves, acidity strength of catalysts decreases in the sequence: AI>Ga>Fe>> B [24]. The acidity of the A1, Ga and Fe materials is very similar and in all cases rather high. Borosilicates are, on the contrary, very weakly acidic [24]. If some reaction, like skeletal isomerisation of n-butene, requires active sites of moderate acidity, modification in composition of zeolites brings about only a limited improvement. Attempts to synthesise moderately acidic ZSM-5 using another element (for example indium) were J. Hou~vidka et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 165 (1997) 443-449 449 not very successful, despite of all effort [25]. Situation is even worse for other zeolites than ZSM-5, where the substitution of aluminium by another element is often difficult. However, a moderate acidity of sites is achieved in substituted APO's. The unique combina- tion of a high shape selectivity with a moderate acidity on MAPO's 11 results in selectivity close to 100% and isobutene yield about 40% [5,9]. Apparently on all zeolites, moderate acidity can be achieved by a replacement of bridging Si(A1)OH groups by the P-OH groups [6,9]. However, large problems also occur here. Lattice of most zeolites collapses when treated at a low pH with phosphoric acid or with POCI3 [26]. Treatment with trimethyl phosphite in a non-aqueous solution is a more gentle method. Structure of zeolite is then preserved, but sometimes a significant decrease in activity also occurs. This loss of activity can be caused by reactions of trimethyl phosphite in the presence of water or by extraction of AlzO3 which subsequently blocks pores. Increase in selectivity to isobutene after the treatment with trimethyl phosphite can originate in a lower acidity of P-OH groups as well as in modification of the cavity diameter. A more detailed study would be necessary to resolve this problem. 5. Conclusions 1. Skeletal isomerisation of n-butene to isobutene can run selectively via a rnonomolecular mechan- ism. This is concluded from the fact that all four ways mentioned in the Introduction (numbered points 1 to 4) show how to suppress the bimolecular mechanism and thus, how to rela- tively enhance the monomolecular mechanism, lead to increase in selectivity. 2. By-products are formed via a bimolecular mechan- ism. Their formation can be suppressed by the suppression of dirnerisation of butenes. 3. Selectivity to isobutene can be generally increased in these ways: by shape selectivity, a higher reac- tion temperature, a lower partial pressure of reac- tants, or by moderate acidity. 4. Modifying the factors mentioned under point 3, ZSM-5 can be made a stable, active and rather selective catalyst for skeletal isomerisation of n- butene.

A series of H-ZSM-5 catalysts with a varying Si/Al ratio, varying particle size and varying substitution (Fe for Al) has been studied in skeletal isomerisation of n-butene in continuous flow experiments. The various H-ZSM-5 catalysts which, unlike the other 10-membered ring molecular sieves, show a very low selectivity at standard conditions, have been used under modified reaction conditions. After changes on the catalyst, and under optimised conditions ZSM-5 showed rather high selectivity and yield of isobutene. The just mentioned modifications were suggested on basis of the knowledge on the mechanism of skeletal isomerisation and of the accompanying side reactions.
