The synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) by oxidative carbonylation of MeOH has been studied in the presence of various catalyst systems. The effect of catalyst composition on the catalytic activity and product composition is investigated. A three-component catalyst system composed of PdCl2(PPh3)2, Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl shows synergy effects in terms of the MeOH conversion (26%) and DMC selectivity (95%). The reaction performed in the presence of a single-component catalyst PdCl2(PPh3)2 produces dimethoxy methane (DMM) as a major product with selectivity over 90%, while the addition of Me4NCl or Cu(OMe)2 to PdCl2(PPh3)2 results in the increase of DMC selectivity from 2% to 60%. Keywords Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) Oxidative carbonylation Palladium compound Three-component catalyst Synergy effect 1 Introduction Dimethyl carbonate (DMC, (MeO)2CO) has been attracting much attention as an important chemical feed stock recently. It has versatile chemical properties as a nontoxic carbonylating and methylating agent by the presence of a carbonyl group and two methoxy groups in its molecule. It can be effectively used as an environmentally benign substitute for phosgene in polycarbonate and isocyanate synthesis, and for dimethyl sulfate in various methylation reactions [1,2]. In addition, a lot of researches for the use of a potential gasoline fuel additive are going on owing to its high oxygen content [3]. DMC has about three times higher oxygen content than methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and its synthesis is not dependent on isobutylene yields like MTBE. Several reaction routes have been known for DMC production so far and they are as follows. The phosgene–methanol process: (1) COCl 2+2CH 3 OH→(CH 3)2 CO+HCl The ester exchange process: (2) (CH 2)2 O+CO 2→(CH 2 O)2 CO (3) (CH 2 O)2 CO+2CH 3 OH→(CH 3 O)2 CO+(CH 2 OH)2 The carbon monoxide–methyl nitrite process: (4) CO+2MeONO→(CH 3 O)2 CO+2NO The oxidative carbonylation of MeOH has been extensively studied for the production of DMC [4–14]. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst systems have been investigated with a variety of main-group metal compounds [4,19], transition metal complexes [4–9,13], 2 2 Among many patents, the following are those with catalyst systems containing palladium compound catalysts: (a) U.S. Patent 4,005,128, Atlantic Richfield (Zehner), 1977. (b) Europe Patent 354,970, Daicel Chemical Industries (Yokota), 1990. (c) Europe Patent 350,697, General Electric (Chang), 1990. (d) Europe Patent 507,546, General Electric, (King), 1992. (e) Europe Patent 508,340, Idemitsu Kosan (Kezuka), 1992. transition metal-zeolites [10,12,15], solid-supported metals [16] and others [17,18]. Among various transition metals employed for the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH, palladium and copper are most frequently used [4–6,11,13–15]. 2 We now wish to report the new three-component catalyst system consisting of PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl for the carbonylation of MeOH, which produces DMC in relatively high yield and selectivity (Eq. 5). (5) MeOH+CO+1/2O 2 →(MeO) 2 CO+H 2 O catalyst system=PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl. 2 Results and discussion DMC is produced in relatively good yield with high selectivity from the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH in the presence of PdCl2(PPh3)2, Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl at 120°C (Eq. 5). The detailed data for the production of DMC with MeOH, CO and O2 are given in Table 1 . 2.1 Catalytic activities of palladium compounds In the presence of a single-component catalyst, PdCl2 or PdCl2(PPh3)2, the conversion and selectivity are relatively low and dimethoxy methane (DMM) is predominantly produced (>90%). Dimethyl oxalate (DMO) is not produced at all under the experimental conditions even though DMO has been frequently observed in the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH [6,7,9,20]. It is noticed that the conversion of MeOH is higher with PdCl2(PPh3)2 (11%) than with PdCl2 (4%). 2.2 Catalytic activities of copper compounds Cu(OMe)2 itself does not show any appreciable catalytic activity for the reaction, while CuCl2 is found to be fairly active under the same experimental conditions. Addition of Cu(OMe)2 to PdCl2(PPh3)2, however, significantly increases the selectivity to DMC while producing a considerable amount of DMO. The addition of CuCl2 to PdCl2(PPh3)2 decreases the conversion but increases the DMC selectivity compared with PdCl2(PPh3)2 only. Addition of Cu(OMe)2 to PdCl2 practically gives the same results as those obtained with Cu(OMe)2/PdCl2(PPh3)2 even though PdCl2 alone shows lower conversion than PdCl2(PPh3)2. It should be mentioned that the addition of Cu(OMe)2 to palladium compounds (PdCl2(PPh3)2 or PdCl2) significantly increases the selectivity to DMC. 2.3 Tetramethylammonium chloride (Me4NCl) as a promoter Me4NCl is not active at all under the same experimental conditions. Addition of Me4NCl to PdCl2(PPh3)2 considerably increases the selectivity to DMC, giving nearly same conversion as PdCl2(PPh3)2. The presence of Me4NCl seems to play a role in increasing the polarity of O–H bond in MeOH and thus facilitating the O–H bond cleavage. 2.4 Two-component catalyst system The activity of Cu(OMe)2 is strikingly increased by the addition of Me4NCl in both conversion and selectivity. On the other hand, the addition of Me4NCl to CuCl2 does not show any appreciable change in conversion. Interestingly, both Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl and CuCl2/Me4NCl systems exhibit much higher selectivity for DMC than other two-component catalyst systems, PdCl2(PPh3)2/Me4NCl, PdCl2/Me4NCl, PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2 and PdCl2(PPh3)2/CuCl2. 2.5 Three-component catalyst system The catalyst system consisting of PdCl2(PPh3)2, Cu(OMe)2, and Me4NCl gives higher MeOH conversion and DMC selectivity compared with single- and two-component catalyst systems and other three-component catalyst systems (see Table 1). The effect of catalyst composition on MeOH conversion and DMC selectivity is investigated and the results are listed in Table 2 . The highest conversion of MeOH is obtained at the molar ratio of PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl=0.1/2.5/5.0. 2.6 Synergy effect Either Cu(OMe)2 or Me4NCl is found to be completely inactive for the carbonylation of MeOH. However, the combination of Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl shows a remarkable synergy effect, producing DMC with 14% conversion and 99% selectivity. Such a synergy effect is also observed in the three-component catalyst system, PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl, giving much higher MeOH conversion of 26% in comparison with any combination of two components. 2.7 Reaction condition Table 3 shows the effect of PCO and PO2 on the activity of the three-component catalyst with molar ratio of PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl=0.1/2.5/5.0. The selectivity to DMC does not seem to depend largely on the partial pressures of CO and O2 in the range of P O2 /P CO=0.2–0.5. It is noticed that a significant amount of DMO is produced with P O2 /P CO=0.15 and total pressure=700 psig. The conversion of MeOH does not change much when the ratio P O2 /P CO is in the range of 0.4–0.5 with the total pressure being higher than 700 psig. Table 4 shows the effect of reaction time on the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH. The conversion of MeOH increases with increasing time up to 60 min and remains thereafter. As shown in Table 5 , the DMC selectivity and MeOH conversion gradually increase with the temperature rise. As the temperature rises, the production of DMO decreases. It has been found in separate experiments that DMO does not undergo decarbonylation to give DMC under the same experimental conditions employed in this study. It is likely that DMO would not be decomposed to give DMC at higher temperatures (120–140°C). DMM has been also observed in the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH by electrolysis [4,13,14,21,22]. It is suggested that electrolysis of MeOH produces HCHO and HCOOH that immediately react further with MeOH in the presence of an acid to give DMM and HCOOCH3 [13,14]. Neither HCHO nor HCOOMe has been found in this study. However, it seems also possible to produce HCHO from dehydrogenation of MeOH, since it is well known that transition metal compounds catalyze dehydrogenation of alcohols (RCH2OH) to give aldehydes (RCHO) [23]. Further investigation should be carried out to suggest reaction pathways for the production of DMM. The effect of molar ratio of MeOH/catalyst on the oxidative carbonylation was studied. The molar ratio of MeOH/catalyst was varied in comparison with fixed amounts of MeOH for the optimization and the results are shown in Table 6 . When the molar ratio of MeOH/catalyst is 1200, the reaction shows the highest yield and DMC selectivity. Large amounts of CO2 produced after the reaction indicate that the oxidation of CO (2CO+O2→2CO2) simultaneously occurs with the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH. It is likely that the formation of CO2 reduces the activity of catalyst system. This is supported by separate experiment where the initial addition of CO2 affects the remarkable decrease of MeOH conversion. In the reaction performed with the ratio of O2/CO/CO2=2/5/3 (total pressure=1000 psig), only 5% MeOH conversion is obtained, which is much lower in comparison with 26% obtained in the absence of CO2. The beige solid was isolated from the reaction mixture after 1 h of the catalytic reaction and its catalytic activity was tested for the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH. However, only 8% MeOH conversion and 5% DMC selectivity had been obtained with the formation of considerable amounts of DMM (38%) and DMO (57%). Spectral (1H, 13C, 31P NMR and IR) data for the beige solid do not provide much information about the nature of the beige solid which has been isolated from the reaction mixture of PdCl2(PPh3)2, Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl maintained for 1 h at 120°C. On the other hand, a white solid has been isolated from the reaction mixture maintained for 30 min at 60°C under P CO=500 psig and P O2 =200 psig. This white solid does not seem pure enough to be fully characterized while its 1H NMR (in CDCl3) spectra clearly shows three singlets at δ 2.391, 3.080 and 3.313 ppm. These signals are most likely due to CH 3 protons and are probably assigned to one of M–O–(CO)CH 3 , M–OCH 3 , and M–CO–OCH 3 . Infrared spectrum (Nujol) of the white solid shows a strong absorption band at 1674.0 cm−1 which is assigned to ν CO. Another beige solid has been isolated from the reaction of PdCl2(PPh3)2, with CO (500 psig) and O2 (200 psig) in MeOH at 60°C for 30 min in the absence of Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl. The 1H NMR (in CDCl3) and infrared (in Nujol) spectra show a singlet at δ 2.398 and strong absorption band at 1953 cm−1 that are assigned to M–O–COCH 3 protons and ν CO of a metal-carbonyl (M–CO). These spectral data above might be in agree with those species M–CO, M–OCH3, M–CO–OCH3 and M–O–CO–OCH3 suggested as the intermediates during the catalytic formation of DMC in presence of transition metal compounds. Oxidative carbonylation of MeOH to produce DMC has been studied with several transition metal complexes such as PdII(OAc)2(PPh3)2 [6], [{CoII(salen)}2]H2O [7] and CuICl [9] and methoxycarbonyl complexes, M(COOCH3)2 and M(COOCH3)(OCH3) have been frequently suggested as the intermediates during the formation of DMC and DMO [6,7,9]. Methoxycarbonyl complexes of Pd [20], Pt [24], and Ir [25] have been obtained from the reactions of M–OCH3 with CO, M–CO with OCH3 and related reactions. It is readily understood that DMC and DMO are then the products of reductive elimination of M(COOCH3)(OCH3) and M(COOCH3)2, respectively. It still remains unknown how the three compounds, Cu(OMe)2, PdCl2(PPh3)2 and Me4NCl, cooperatively work together to show such a synergy effect to produce DMC in good yield and selectivity. CO2 formation is another problem that should be solved to increase the conversion of MeOH. Deactivation of the catalyst systems should also be investigated more in detail, which would be very helpful in the investigation for suppression of deactivation as well as regeneration of the catalytic activity. 3 Conclusions The effects of various factors affecting the oxidative carbonylation of MeOH have been investigated in the presence of a new catalyst system comprising Pd, Cu compounds, and amine salts. A three-component catalyst system composed of PdCl2(PPh3)2, Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl shows synergy effects in terms of the MeOH conversion (26%) and DMC selectivity (95%). The highest DMC yield of 24.7% is obtained at 120°C, PdCl2(PPh3)2/Cu(OMe)2/Me4NCl=0.1/2.5/5.0, and P O2 /P CO=0.4 (P tot=700 psig). The DMC selectivity is more strongly dependent on the temperature than on the pressure and reaction time. 4 Experimental 4.1 Materials PdCl2 (Aldrich), Cu(OMe)2 and Me4NCl (Tokyo Kasei) were used as purchased. Palladium complexes (PdCl2L2 (L2=(PPh3)2, Ph2CH2CH2PPh2)) were prepared from the reactions of PdCl2 and phosphines according to the published procedures [26]. HPLC grade MeOH (99.93%) was purchased from Aldrich and stored over molecular sieve 4 Å. CO and O2 (both >99.99%) were purchased from Deokyang Gas. 4.2 Reactions All reactions were performed in a 25-ml stainless steel bomb reactor and the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer during the reaction. Premixed O2/CO were introduced into the reactor containing catalyst and MeOH. Total pressure and molar ratio of O2/CO were varied in the range, 400–800 psig and 0.1–0.5, respectively. The reactor was then heated to a specified temperature and the temperature was maintained during the reaction. 4.3 Product analysis The reaction mixture was filtered and the products in filtrate were analyzed by GC (Donam DS-6200A) equipped with FID using BP-1 column (0.25 μm×30 m). Gaseous products in the reactor were analyzed on-line with TCD using 3.2 mm×6 m column filled with polydivinyl benzene (HayeSep D, CRS). 4.4 Isolation of metal complexes A 50-ml portion of hexane was added to the reaction mixture and the solid products were isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum.
