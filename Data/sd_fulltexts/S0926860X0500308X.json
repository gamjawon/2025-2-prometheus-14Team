Here, synthesis of todorokite containing Al in its framework was studied and its formation by the hydrothermal method was, for the first time, confirmed by combining the results of ICP, XRD and TEM. There existed a limitation to the amount of Al that could be incorporated into the structure, probably because of the cation-to-cation repulsion in the channel. The oxidation of cyclohexane with tert-butyl hydroperoxide was studied as a model reaction. Results revealed that Al-containing todorokite and proton-exchanged Al-containing todorokite promoted the reaction to cyclohexyl alcohol and cyclohexanone. Keywords Octahedral molecular sieve Todorokite Manganese Hydrothermal synthesis Oxidation Cyclohexane 1 Introduction Many manganese compounds having a layered structure or a one-dimensional micro- or meso-porous structure are known [1–9]. One manganese compound with a layered structure is called birnessite [1–3], and two of the manganese compounds having interesting one-dimensional pore structures (tunnel structure) are known as hollandite and todorokite [4,5]. These manganese compounds are made up from MnO6 octahedra as a fundamental unit and these units are connected with each other by their corners and edges [7,8]. The rectangular pore mouths of hollandite and todorokite consist of 2×2 and 3×3 arrays of the MnO6 unit; the rectangular pore sizes of hollandite and todorokite calculated from their structures are 0.46nm×0.46nm and 0.69nm×0.69nm, respectively. To synthesize hollandite and todorokite, one needs template cations, namely potassium and magnesium, respectively. These cations are located inside the channel and can be ion-exchanged with other cations such as alkali cations or alkaline earth cations by the conventional ion-exchange method. Although hollandite and todorokite are expected as a functional material for catalysts, adsorbents or battery materials, not so many researches are reported so far and, therefore, it is interesting to further study the functionalization of these materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis of todorokite having Al in its framework and the liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexane as a model reaction using the obtained materials as catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Referring to the method to synthesize Al-free todorokite [10], we developed a procedure to obtain Al-containing todorokite as follows. The procedure has three steps: synthesis of birnessite of layered structure; ion-exchange of birnessite to buserite; and final transformation of buserite to todorokite by hydrothermal treatment. Typically, 0.45g (2.85mmol) of KMnO4 was added into 52ml of 4.0M NaOH solution. Similarly, 0.045g (0.55mmol) NaAlO2 was dissolved in 10ml of distilled water and this solution was added to another solution composed of 1.59g (8.03mmol) of MnCl2·4H2O, 0.32g (1.57mmol) of MgCl2·6H2O and distilled water of 35ml. The latter mixture was added to the former solution and the mixture thus obtained was stirred at room temperature in air for 1 week. Thus [Na, Mg]-Al-birnessite was obtained. This birnessite was ion-exchanged with 90ml of 1.5M MgCl2·6H2O at room temperature for 24h under stirring and thus [Mg]-Al-buserite was obtained. Then, this mixture was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 130°C for 2 days under stirring and thus [Mg]-Al-todorokite was synthesized. Here, the cation at the ion-exchange site is shown in the parentheses. In the case Al is incorporated, it is shown between the ion-exchange cation(s) and the bulk structure. By ion-exchange of birnessite and todorokite with 2M NH4NO3 at 90°C and following calcination in air at 300°C for 2h, [H, Mg]-Al-birnessite and [H, Mg]-Al-todorokite were obtained, respectively. 2.2 Oxidation of cyclohexane with tert-butyl hydroperoxide Into a stainless steel autoclave of 30ml, 4.20g (56.8mmol) of tert-butyl alcohol (solvent), 1.80g (24.3mmol) of cyclohexane, 2.00g (22.2mmol) of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and 0.034g of catalyst were placed. The atmosphere was changed to nitrogen and the autoclave was heated and maintained at 60°C for 40h. All the reagents were used as received. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography with FID (column: Unisole 30T 5% Uniport HP). 2.3 Characterization The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), JEOL JDX-3530, using Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 20mA. The morphology of the particles was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), JEOL JEM-2000FX, at 200kV. Elemental analyses were conducted by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP), Shimadzu ICPS-1000 III. The surface area of the product was measured by the nitrogen adsorption method (BET), BEL JAPAN BELSORP-mini-2. Thermogravimetric analyses (TG-DTA) were conducted on a Shimadzu DTG-60H under airflow. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization Table 1 and Fig. 1 show the results of elemental analyses of synthesized products and their XRD patterns, respectively. From Table 1, there seems to be a limitation to the amount of Al-incorporated into the structure of birnessite and todorokite under the synthesis conditions adopted. If the valence of Mn is 4+, then no cation is needed in the channel. However, cations such as Na+ and Mg2+ are necessary to compensate for the insufficient charge of Mn3+ or Al3+ against O2−. Then, there may be a limit to the density of adjacent cations so as not to cause too much cation-to-cation repulsion, and this might be a reason for the limited number of Al ions incorporated. The XRD pattern of [Mg]-todorokite (Fig. 1a) was in good agreement with that reported [10,11] and indicates the good crystallinity of [Mg]-todorokite. XRD patterns of [Mg]-Al-todorokite (Fig. 1b) also suggested that the crystallinity of the material was good, though the relative peak intensity differed from that of the Al-free todorokite. When the amount of Al in the starting mixture was large, a material of poor crystallinity was obtained (Fig. 1c). TEM photos of [Mg]-todorokite and [Mg]-Al-todorokite are shown in Fig. 2 . The low magnification image of [Mg]-todorokite (Fig. 2a) demonstrates the layered nature. The high magnification image of [Mg]-todorokite (Fig. 2b) shows parallel lines, indicating layers in one direction. If todorokite is really formed, then two lines perpendicular to each other should be observed. Therefore, this phenomenon is not consistent with the former result of XRD, which indicated the formation of well-crystallized todorokite. Fig. 2c shows a high magnification TEM photo of [Mg]-Al-todorokite. Although our resolution is not very high, parallel lines similar to Fig. 2b are observed, suggesting that Al is incorporated in the todorokite structure. BET surface areas for [Mg]-todorokite and [Mg]-Al-todorokite were 103 and 96m2 g−1, respectively. Together with the result of XRD, this result supports the conclusion that Al is incorporated into the todorokite structure. Todorokite of high surface area up to 250m2 g−1 is reported [12,13] and also todorokite of low surface area of about 30–50m2 g−1 is reported [11]. Therefore, the differences in the magnitude of the surface area among samples might be from differences in the morphology of the primary particles. Tables 2 and 3 show the molar ratios of Mg/Mn and Al/Mn during and after ion exchange with ammonium cation, respectively. It is apparent that by the repeated ion exchange the number of Mg2+ decreased gradually for both Al-free and Al-containing todorokites. Ion exchange of Mg2+ to cations such as Co2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ is also reported [14,15]. On the other hand, the Al/Mn ratio did not change by ion exchange, and this again suggests that Al is not at the ion-exchange sites but in the todorokite framework. The influence of ion exchange on the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 3 . For both [Mg]-todorokite and [Mg]-Al-todorokite, decreases of peak intensities were observed. The BET surface area of [H, Mg]-todorokite after ion-exchange repeated for three times decreased from 103 to 44m2 g−1 and that of [H, Mg]-Al-todorokite after twice repeated ion-exchanges decreased from 96 to 67m2 g−1. These results suggest that part of the crystal was destroyed during the ion-exchange procedure. Considering these results together, one can say that Al is incorporated in the framework of todorokite, not at the ion-exchange site. Magnesium at the ion-exchange site was partly ion-exchanged to protons. During the ion-exchange procedure, the crystallinity of todorokite decreased to some extent, roughly from 50% to 70% of the original. 3.2 Oxidation of cyclohexane As a model reaction, the oxidation of cyclohexane (c-C6) with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was studied; the result is shown in Table 4 . Under the reaction conditions adopted, without catalyst the conversion based on c-C6 and TBHP was 10.7% and 29.0%, respectively. On birnessite and [Mg]-todorokite, the conversion was almost the same as that without catalyst. Incorporation of Al into todorokite structure improved the conversion from 10.7% to 16.6%. By ion exchange of Mg2+ to H+, the conversion also increased; without Al, from 11.5% to 17.5% and with Al, from 16.6% to 18.0%, respectively. When Mg2+ is exchanged to H+, it is expected that the acidity of todorokite will increase. This might be one reason for the improvement of the conversion. On the other hand, as the yields of cyclohexyl alcohol and cyclohexanone did not change drastically among catalysts, the effect of enlarged pore size by ion exchange may prevail; the diffusivity of cyclohexane or oxidized products was improved and this resulted in the higher conversion. Wang et al. [10] studied the same reaction and they reported that [Mg]-todorokite (OMS-1 in [10]) catalyzed the reaction. However, our [Mg]-todorokite gave no substantial activity. This discrepancy may be because of the amount of catalyst used; Wang et al. [10] used twice as much catalyst as we did. 4 Conclusions An octahedral molecular sieve, todorokite, containing Al in the framework, was for the first time synthesized. Although birnessite, an intermediate material to todorokite, did not have catalytic activity for cyclohexane oxidation with tert-butyl hydroperoxide, Al-incorporated and proton-exchanged todorokite promoted the reaction.
