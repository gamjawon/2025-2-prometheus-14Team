Tel.: +86-1-6292-3564. Composite oxide MO x /Al2O3 supported gold catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were prepared and investigated. The presence of transition metal oxide was proved to be beneficial to the improvement of catalytic performance of Au/Al2O3 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. Furthermore, the influence of various pretreatment conditions on Au/MO x /Al2O3 catalysts was studied carefully. The image of TEM showed that gold catalyst with small gold particles only in the form of a fine dispersion exhibited highly catalytic activity. The XPS, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy characterization results of Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst showed that gold catalysts having partially oxidized gold species have the best catalytic performance. One possible pathway for CO oxidation on Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is that the CO adsorbed on gold particles reacts with adsorbed oxygen, which is possible to occur on oxygen vacancies on the support or at the metal–support interface. Keywords Gold catalyst CO oxidation Composite oxide support Pretreatment conditions Gold nanoparticle 1 Introduction The low reactivity of gold is attributed to the completely filled 5d atomic orbital and the relatively high value of its first ionization potential [1]. Since Haruta et al. [2] reported that CO oxidation could be achieved at room temperature over gold catalysts when very small gold nanoparticles were dispersed on suitable oxide supports. The last decade has witnessed a rapid growth of interest in the catalysis by gold. Recently, Bond and Thompson [3] have reviewed the advancement of gold catalysts in tension and depth. The choice of the prepared method is very critical for gold catalyst performances. Among the reported methods, co-precipitation (CP) or deposition precipitation (DP) was employed frequently. CP is easy to control with a powder sample obtained. DP has the advantage over CP in that all of the active components remain on the surface of the support and none active gold component is buried within it. This method is also applicable to any form of support, such as beads, honeycombs and thin film [4]. But it is very difficult to control the properties of a supported gold catalyst prepared by DP, because they are highly sensitive to preparation condition [5]. Although the use of gold catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation has been studied intensively, many aspects concerning gold catalytic behaviors are yet unclear. The presence of gold as small particles appear to be crucial for the high-activity [6,7]. Previous comparative studies showed that the activity of supported gold catalysts depends sensitively on the support materials [8–10]. Gold catalysts on a single oxide support were extensively studied. Also, some composite oxide supports, such as ZnFe2O4, NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4 [11] were investigated. Recently, the composite oxides supports of MO x /Al2O3 were employed by Grisel and Nieuwenhuys to prepare the Au/MO x /Al2O3 catalysts, and used for oxidation of CO and CH4 [12] and CO selective oxidation in H2-rich gas [13]. Al2O3 is a most common kind of oxide used as support in industrial catalytic process. However, Al2O3 is not regarded as a good support for gold catalysts. Schubert et al.’s studies [8] showed that Al2O3 was very different from reducible oxides such as FeO x , NiO x , CoO x and so on. When gold supported on the former oxide, which is believed to behave as neutral in the reaction process, only moderately active catalysts obtained. However, Au catalysts supported on reducible transition metal oxides exhibited very high activities. Perhaps, this resulted from synergistic effects between the gold nanoparticles and support material [2,8,10,14,15]. Therefore, gold catalysts supported on composite MO x /Al2O3 supports seem to have the possibility to realize the commercialization of high-activity catalysts. It is desirable to develop this kind of Au/MO x /Al2O3 catalysts for practicable applications. In this paper, various composite MO x /Al2O3 supported gold catalysts were prepared, and the influence of pretreatment conditions on the catalytic activity was investigated. Characterization techniques, such as XPS, X-ray diffraction (XRD), TEM and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to study the CO oxidation on Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation γ–Al2O3 (surface area =169m2 g−1, total pore volume = 0.41mlg−1, particle size = 1mm) was used as support. M(NO3) n ·mH2O was the precursor of the corresponding metal oxide (MO x ). Composite MO x /Al2O3 supports were prepared via iso-volume impregnation. The samples were dried at 373K over night, heated to 673K with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1 and kept for 2h. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O was used as Au precursor. Au was dispersed on support materials, such as Al2O3 and MO x /Al2O3, by homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) using urea as a precipitation reagent. The suspensions were kept at 350K under vigorous stirring to ensure a slow and gradual increase of pH value. When the pH reached 8.0, the suspensions were filtered and washed thoroughly to remove chloride ions. The samples were dried overnight at 373K and subsequently calcined at different temperatures under a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. 2.2 Activity evaluation The activity of the catalysts for CO oxidation was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor. The CO + O2 + N2 (CO: 0.5%, O2: 21.1%, N2: 78.4%) mixture passed through the catalyst bed with a space velocity (SV) of about 8000h−1. The reactants and the products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (SQ-206), equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector connected with a carbon sieve column. Catalytic activity was indicated by the lowest complete conversion temperature (denoted by T 100%). The lower the T 100%, the higher the activity of the catalyst. 2.3 Catalyst characterization A NOVA 1200 high-speed gas sorption analyzer was used to determine the BET surface area and the pore volume distribution of the samples. The Au content of the catalysts was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma-atom emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a IRIS Advantage spectrometer. X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Rigaku D/Max-Rc X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation. A XSAM 800 system was used for XPS measurements, with AlKα radiation as a target. The TEM measurements were performed on a Hitachi H-700 electron microscope equipped with an EDAX 9100 spectroscopy. Maximum resolution was 0.34nm at 250,000 magnifications. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Hitachi 270-30 infrared spectrophotometer with a 2cm−1 resolution at room temperature. The catalysts were pressed in flake, and then placed into a special vacuum cell, which allowed catalyst evaluation and sequential CO adsorption. The samples were evaluated at 473K for 2h and then cooled down room temperature. IR spectra were in situ scanned at room temperature for 1h after sequential CO adsorption. The spectra were obtained by subtracting the background of the sample prior to the CO adsorption and IR adsorption of CO in gas phase. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Influence of composite FeOx/Al2O3 supports The activity of FeO x /Al2O3 and various gold catalysts on different supports are listed in Table 1 . FeO x /Al2O3 was found not to be particularly active in CO oxidation. In fact, no obvious CO conversion was detected until 420K. Table 1 gives an example of the activity of different catalysts. Au/Fe2O3 catalyst made by CP [9] is more active than Au/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by HDP, and Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst clearly exhibits a better performance than Au/Al2O3 catalyst. Support Al2O3 has a specific surface area of approximately 169m2 g−1. The surface area of Au/Al2O3 and Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is about 166.7 and 154.8m2 g−1, respectively, which are very close to Al2O3. Fig. 1 shows that the pore volume distribution of Al2O3, FeO x /Al2O3 and Au/FeO x /Al2O3. Just a slight loss of pore volume is observed when prepared gold catalyst on composite FeO x /Al2O3 support. Fig. 2 shows a TEM image of Au/Al2O3 and Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalysts. Gold particles are clearly visible as spherical dark particles embedded in lighter patches of metal oxide. In Fig. 2b, no isolated areas of FeO x are formed. FeO x is rather homogeneously distributed on the surface. TEM investigations reveal that Au/FeO x /Al2O3 and Au/Al2O3 catalysts, which have comparable gold particle size distributions (most of the particles in the range of 3–6nm), result to be significantly different in the catalytic activities in CO oxidation. The T 100% of Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is much lower than Au/Al2O3 catalyst. This shows that the catalytic activity depends on both the gold particle size and the nature of the support. 3.2 Influence of different support materials The experimental results (Table 2 ) indicated clearly that the performances of Au catalysts were greatly improved by using composite oxide supports. Compared with literature data [12], the catalysts in this study showed excellent catalytic behavior. The T 100% of Au/Al2O3 catalyst is lower 136K than Grisel’s reaction data [12]. It was FeO x /Al2O3 as composite oxide support that enhanced the catalyst performance enormously. Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst can oxidize CO to CO2 even at 223K. The activity order for low-temperature CO oxidation is Au/FeO x /Al2O3 > Au/MnO x /Al2O3, Au/CoO x /Al2O3 > Au/CuO x /Al2O3 > Au/NiO x /Al2O3. This shows that the nature of the composite oxide supports plays an important role on the activity improvement of gold catalysts. Fig. 3 shows an acceptable homogeneous size distribution of Au/MO x /Al2O3 catalysts. All the observed gold particles are very small, most of them in the range of 3–6nm. It shows that nano-sized, well-dispersed gold particle is necessary to obtain high-activity Au catalysts, which also confirms that nano-sized gold particles are prerequisite for high-activity gold catalysts. However, the interaction between gold and transition metal oxide appears to be also of substantial importance in the case of CO oxidation. 3.3 Influence of Au loading The relationship between the activity and the Au loading of Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is listed in Table 3 . The high-activity depended on the content of gold in the catalyst, the higher the gold content, and the lower the T 100%. The optimum Au content is 0.5wt.%, which has an appreciably high catalytic activity (T 100% is 223K). On the other hand, the long-term stability of the catalyst was also related to the gold content. 0.1wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst was found to have a sustained activity without deactivation during 57h at room temperature in the condition of SV 8000h−1. However, the activity for 0.5wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is more than 150h in SV of 11,000h−1. Changing SV from 11,000 to 25,000h−1, the catalyst still converted CO to CO2 completely for more than 20h without any deactivation. This indicates 0.5wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst possesses high-activity and good catalytic durability. 3.4 Influence of precipitation reagents It can be seen from Table 3 that the variation of the precipitation reagents did not affect the catalytic activity of gold catalysts more except for urea. Using NaOH, KOH or NH4OH instead of Na2CO3 elucidated that Na+, K+, NH4 +, CO3 − and so on have little effect on the catalytic activity of the synthesized materials. Compared with the other precipitation reagents, the high-activity of Au catalyst prepared by urea precipitation is due to its slow and uniform decomposition to produce hydroxide ions in preparation process. 3.5 Influence of pH value of precipitation solution The catalytic activity of supported gold catalysts was found to depend strongly on the pH value of the precipitation solution, since dissolution of HAuCl4 (gold precursor) in water may yield three kinds of possible gold species. At pH 5.5–7.0, most of the Au precursor is present as AuCl n (OH)4−n −, which can dissolve in water. At pH value around 7–8, most of the Cl− will be displaced by OH− then leading to a neutrally charged Au(OH)3 species, which precipitates from the solution. Under basic condition, the Au(OH)3 can dissolve again as Au(OH)4 −. The pH of the precipitation solution is very important not only to determine the speciation of AuCl n (OH)4−n −, but also influences the amount of chloride adsorbed on the support. The amount of adsorbed chloride on a support depends on the isoelectric point of the support and its adsorption capacity [16]. The varied metal oxide has different optimum pH value for the synthesis of active gold catalysts. The optimum pH of Au/Al2O3 (the isoelectric points of Al2O3 is ∼9) is 5.5–8.5 [17]; that of Au/TiO2 (the isoelectric points of TiO2 is ∼6–7) 7.0; and that of Au/MgO (the isoelectric points of MgO is ∼12) 9.6 [18]. Fig. 4 shows the effect of pH value of precipitation solution on the T 100% of 0.1wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalysts. The pH value dramatically affected the activity of the gold catalysts. Below pH 7, the T 100% was as high as 312K. With an increasing of the pH value, the T 100% became lower and lower. When the pH value reached 8.0, the best catalytic activity was obtained which can catalytically oxidize CO to CO2 even at 251K. The activity decreases slowly with the continuous increasing of the pH. As a result, the optimum pH to prepare Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst from precipitating solution was around 8.0–8.5. 3.6 Influence of calcinations temperature Among the gold species on supported Au catalysts prepared by the DP method, Au(OH)3 of deposited gold species is thermally unstable at 373K, and tends to decompose into metallic gold during the drying treatment. 4Au(OH)3→4Au+6H 2 O+3O 2 The dominant gold species remaining on the dried sample could be the chloride-contaminated gold species (mainly AuCl n (OH)4−n −), which are not active gold species. It is therefore of interest to determine the minimum temperature required for decomposition of this chloride-contaminated gold to active gold species. We investigated the influence of the calcinations temperature on the catalytic activity by treating the as-made materials at different temperatures. The results show in Fig. 5 . The catalysts pretreated in air at 373K over night had already had certain activity, which can oxidize CO to CO2 at 295K. With the increase of calcinations temperature, the catalytic activity increased higher. The catalyst calcined at 573K showed the best catalytic activity (T 100% is 251K). Above 573K, the catalytic activity began to decrease. Perhaps for the reason of sintering, the catalyst calcined at 773K showed a very low activity for CO oxidation. 3.7 Catalyst structure characterizations XPS spectra of the Au 4f and Fe 2p binding energies of 0.5wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst, which was calcined at 573K with T 100% 223K, are showed in Fig. 6 . The peaks of Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 are centered at 87.7 and 84.3 (Δ=3.4eV), respectively, which are very close to the binding energy of metallic Au, and far from the binding energy of Au δ+. While Au 4f7/2 peaks of Au0 (e.g. Au), Au+ (e.g. AuCl) and Au3+ (e.g. NaAuCl4) are centered at 83.8, 86.1 and 87.3eV, respectively. The results of XPS indicated that the most portion of gold species on the catalyst surface were metallic gold, with minor portion gold species might be in an oxidized state. Our previous studies [11] showed that the catalyst precipitation precursor was Au(OH)3, when it was treated in an oxygen atmosphere at a relatively low-temperature, gold retained certain oxidized state. The oxidized Au phase was reduced almost completely to metallic Au with the increasing calcinations temperature. However, the gold catalysts with partially oxidation gold species had the best catalytic performance for CO oxidation. Park and Lee [19] also proved that the oxidation of gold species was important for CO oxidation, and they concluded that oxidation gold species were more active than metallic gold. This is different from our results. Our results supported the hypothesis suggested by Bond and Thompson [20], and Kung and co-workers [21] that an active catalyst contained both gold atoms and ions, and the initial activity depended on the ratio of both phases. Only the peaks of metallic gold are detected in XRD spectra (Fig. 7 ), no oxidized gold is observed. The average particle size calculated from the Scherrer’s equation was about 14nm. The TEM image of the same sample shows that numerous small particles are present in gold catalysts. These small particles gave such a large diffraction peak broadening that they were easily disappearing from the background of XRD spectra. A few large Au crystallites observed by XRD suggested that the small amount of Au particles were contained in gold catalysts. Therefore, it is reasonable that no oxidized gold is observed in XRD spectra. Iwasawa and co-workers [10] found that the phase of iron oxide support played an important role in the synthesis of gold catalysts using gold phosphine complexes and as-precipitated wet iron hydroxide. Horvath et al. [22] concluded that the most active sample was the oxidized gold in which the FeO x support contains Fe2O3 in hematite phase and also contains FeO and FeO(OH). It can be observed from Fig. 7 that FeO x shows in four main diffraction peaks, which can be ascribe to hematite phase of Fe2O3. The XPS spectra (Fig. 6b) obtained from the 0.5wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst depicted a predominant peak at around 711.4eV, a band assigned to Fe(III) 2p3/2 in amorphous Fe2O3. This was similar to the related literature [23]. 3.8 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on 0.5wt.% Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst were obtained (Figs. 8 and 9 ). Four main bands are shown in Fig. 8. The band at 2116cm−1, in principle, is assigned to CO chemisorptions on Au0. Because the peak is apparently asymmetric and a shoulder appears from the high-frequently side at 2131cm−1. Judging from the result for Au/TiO2 [6], we can assign the peak to CO adsorbed on oxidized gold sites. The band at 2170–2190cm−1 is usually attributed to CO adsorbed in the typical support oxide [24]. So we attributed the band at 2172cm−1 to CO adsorbed on FeO x . Another two bands at 2361 and 2341cm−1 were assigned to CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst [25]. The bands observed in the 1700–1000cm−1 ranges can be assigned to carbonate-like species adsorbed on the support. Boccuzzi et al.’s study [26] showed that the carbonate-like species might be produced without the participation of molecular oxygen. In fact, no molecular oxygen was fed into the IR analysis system. So the oxygen involved in these carbonate-like species came from the active oxygen species occurred on catalyst surface. A slight reduction of these bands was observed in Fig. 9 because of the slow decomposition of these carbonate-like species. As time passed, the band intensity of CO2 adsorption (in Fig. 8) decreased, which indicated that the dis-adsorption of CO2 was relatively easy and that this process was not a rate-decision step. CO2 was produced by the interaction of CO with adsorbed oxygen, which is possible to occur on oxygen vacancies on the support or at the metal–support interface. As a consequence of the Schotty junction [27], the oxygen vacancies could be present in the proximity of the Au particles at the metal–semiconductor interface. This is in agreement with the conclusion of Hao et al.’s studies [28,29]. In order to explore the reaction of CO with surface oxygen species in absence of gas phase oxygen, CO pulse reaction was conducted on gold catalysts, which showed that the surface adsorbed oxygen species could react with CO adsorbed on gold particles. However, the surface oxygen species were limited and used up gradually with the increase in CO pulse. Gupta and co-workers [30] also suggested that oxygen adsorbing on the support dissociated immediately, producing lattice oxygen which can subsequently react with CO at the interface or after a spillover of oxygen to small Au particles. 4 Conclusions The following conclusions were drawn on CO oxidation over the MO x /Al2O3 supported gold catalysts: 1. The Au/MO x /Al2O3 (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Cu) catalysts are more active than Au/Al2O3 catalysts. HDP is more suitable to prepare gold catalysts for commercial applications. 2. It is necessary for a good catalytic performance to prepare gold catalysts with small gold particles only in the form of a high dispersion. 3. From the characterizations of an Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst, it seems reasonable that for developing high catalytic activity, the gold catalyst should have minor portion oxidized gold species and the transition metal oxide supports should be amorphous which can result in synergistic effects between gold and supports. 4. One possible pathway for CO oxidation on Au/FeO x /Al2O3 catalyst is that the CO adsorbed on gold reacts with adsorbed oxygen, which is possible to occur on oxygen vacancies on the support or at the metal–support interface.
