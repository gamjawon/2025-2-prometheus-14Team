Graphical abstract The Ag/α-Al2O3 catalysts modified with rare earth, alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides for the epoxidation of propylene by molecular oxygen were prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM, CO2-TPD, BET and pore diameter distribution. The results show that adding 0.1wt% Y2O3 into the Ag/K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst increases the selectivity to propylene oxide from 4.3% to 46.8% with 4.0% conversion of propylene at 245°C. The Ag/α-Al2O3 catalysts modified with rare earth, alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides for the epoxidation of propylene by molecular oxygen were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), BET surface area and pore diameter distribution. The results show that the appropriate pore diameter and high surface area of α-Al2O3 support, and the suitable basic sites on the surface of catalyst are necessary to the highly effective Ag catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene. The presence of a small quantity of Y2O3 can restrain the sintering of Ag particles on the surface of α-Al2O3 and adjust the surface basicity of catalyst. The loadings of promoters and reaction temperature obviously affect the performance of Ag catalysts. Under the reaction condition of 0.1MPa, 245°C, space velocity 2000h−1 and the feed of 20% C3H6/8% O2/N2, 4% conversion of propylene and 46.8% selectivity to propylene oxide were obtained over the 20wt% Ag–0.1% Y2O3–0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst. Keywords Silver/alumina catalyst Y2O3 promoter Epoxidation of propylene Molecular oxygen 1 Introduction Propylene oxide (PO) is an extremely important organic intermediate to manufacture polyurethane, unsaturated resins, surfactants and other products. At present PO is mainly produced commercially by the chlorohydrin process and the organic-hydroperoxide (Halcon) process [1]. The chlorohydrin process requires a great deal of chlorine that is expensive, toxic and erosive. In addition, the chlorinated by-products and the disposal of CaCl2 also give rise to serious environmental problems. The disadvantage of the Halcon process is to produce equimolar amounts of co-products whose value lies on a demand in the market. Recently, the new processes and catalysts under development for the production of PO were discussed [2]. For example, the invention of titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) by Taramasso et al. opened a novel route to the epoxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant under mild reaction conditions, in which >95% PO selectivity based on propylene or 70%–99% based on H2O2 was obtained. However, the relatively high cost of H2O2 and TS-1 catalyst hinder the commercialization of this process so far [3–5]. In order to reduce the cost of H2O2, Sato and Miyake [6] and Meiers et al. [4] used Pd or Pd–Pt impregnated TS-1 catalyst to produce H2O2 in situ with a mixture of molecular oxygen and hydrogen, in which 46% PO selectivity was obtained over the TS-1 catalyst loaded with 1wt% Pd and 0.02wt% Pt. Although gold has historically been regarded as being poorly active for most chemical reactions, the highly dispersed nano-Au supported on 3D mesoporous silylated titanosilicate or titanosilicate is a highly effective catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene by the mixture of O2 and H2 at relatively low temperature, in which the PO selectivity of >90% and the propylene conversion of about 8% can be obtained [7,8]. Xi and co-workers [9–12] have prepared H2O2 in situ by the redox reaction of 2-ethylanthraquinone/2-ethylanthrahydroquinone, which could be used for the homogeneous catalytic epoxidation of olefins over a tungsten-containing catalyst. After the epoxidation reaction is finished, the catalyst can precipitate, be filtered and reused again. This process combines the advantages of both homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts in one system through reaction-controlled phase transfer of the catalyst. If this technique of producing PO would be used commercially, the key lies in how to improve the concentration of PO in the reaction medium and overcome the recycling problem of the catalyst. The direct gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with oxygen or air as an oxidant has long been the most desirable as well as challenging goal in the catalysis field. ARCO chemists [13–18] claimed that the propylene conversion of 1.5%–12.6% and selectivity to PO of 32%–60% were achieved over the K, W, Re and Cl modified Ag catalyst supported on CaCO3, CaF2, CaHPO4, CaMoO4 or BaTiO3. The composition of gas phase feed was typically 10% C3H6, 5% O2, optionally 5%–25% CO2, and balance N2, as well as 50–500ppm ethyl chloride, or 20–500ppm NO. The reaction temperature was 220–280°C and GHSV was 800–3000h−1. Lu and Zuo [19] have reported the unsupported Ag catalyst promoted with NaCl or BaCl2. At the condition of GHSV of 17,500h−1, 350°C, 10% C3H6 and balance air, the C3H6 conversion of 18.6% and the selectivity to PO of 33.4% were obtained. Recently, Jin et al. have investigated the Mo-modified silver catalysts for the gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with oxygen. When the oxygen conversion was 6.8%, the selectivity to PO reached 53.1% at 350–450°C [20,21]. Li et al. [22] claimed that the selectivity to PO was 43.4% when propylene conversion was 0.19% over the NaCl-modified VCe1−x Cu x catalyst with molecular oxygen as an oxidant. For the mechanism of silver-catalyzed epoxidation of propylene to PO, Nakatsuji and co-workers [23,24] suggested that the low selectivity to PO was due to a decreased rate of epoxidation of propylene and an increased rate of propylene combustion on the silver surface by different reaction pathways. The epoxidation of olefins was attributed to the reaction of the adsorbed oxygen species with the olefinic carbon atoms to form a α bond between oxygen and olefinic carbon with a breaking of the CC π bond, and the propylene combustion was initiated by the formation of the resonance-stabilized allyl radical or anion through the abstraction of allylic hydrogen by adsorbed oxygen [25–28]. Roberts et al. [29] have proposed a mechanism for the complete oxidation of propylene, that is, an acid–base reaction between atomically adsorbed oxygen and an allylic CH bond, which leads to the formation of surface hydroxyl groups and chemisorbed allyl species that are further oxidized to CO2 and H2O. In this paper, the effects of different promoters on the catalytic performance of Ag/α-Al2O3 were studied. The rare earth, alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides were used as the promoters. We have found that the selectivity to PO could be obviously improved when rare earth element Y was added into the catalyst as promoter. In addition, the influences of the physicochemical properties of the modified α-Al2O3 supports and catalysts on the catalytic performance were also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was prepared as follows: Y(NO3)3, KNO3, Ba(NO3)2 or Ca(NO3)2 was dissolved in distilled water, and then α-Al2O3 (BET surface area of 10.3m2/g, 20–40 mesh) was impregnated with this solution for 1h at 60°C. The particles impregnated were dried at 120°C for 5h, and calcined at 450–800°C for 2h. Subsequently, a silver–ammonium complex solution was synthesized by adding silver oxalate to an aqueous ethylenediamine solution. After modified α-Al2O3 was dunked into the silver–ammonium complex solution for 0.5h at 60°C, the particles were dried at 120°C for 4h and calcined at 280°C for 10min. Four kinds of α-Al2O3 (A–D) with different surface areas and pore diameter distributions were used to study the effects of support on the performance of Ag catalysts. If it is without the special label, α-Al2O3 (D, 10.3m2/g) was used as the support of Ag catalysts. 2.2 Catalytic epoxidation of propylene The catalytic epoxidation of propylene was carried out in a micro-reactor system. The size of the stainless steel fixed-bed reactor was Ø5mm×360mm, in which 0.25ml catalyst was placed. The catalytic epoxidation conditions were at 200–300°C, 0.1MPa and space velocity of 2000h−1. The feedstock gas consisted of 20% C3H6, 8% O2 and balance N2, and their flow rate was controlled by three mass flow meters. The reaction products were identified qualitatively by the quadrupole mass spectrometer (IPC 400, INFICON Ltd.). The concentrations of feedstock and reaction products were analyzed quantitatively by two on-line gas chromatographs with three packed columns (G.D.X-401, silica gel and 5A zeolite) and TCD detectors. Carbon balance was used to calculate the conversion of propylene and selectivity of PO. The conversion of propylene was equal to (n f − n e)/n f (n f is the total mole of carbon in propylene fed and n e is the total mole of carbon in effluent propylene), and the selectivity to PO was equal to n p/(n f − n e) (n p is the total mole of carbon in PO produced). 2.3 Characterization of catalyst The BET surface area and pore size distribution of samples were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M Sorptometer. Before being analyzed, the samples were evacuated at 90°C for 0.5h and at 350°C for 5h under vacuum. The SEM micrographs were obtained on a JEOL JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscopy. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/max-2550/PC powder diffractometer equipped with the Cu Kα radiation. Temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) of adsorbed CO2 was carried out in the conventional flow system equipment with the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The sample (600mg) was pretreated at 500°C for 1h at N2 of 30ml/min, and then it was quenched to room temperature and allowed to adsorb CO2 to saturation at 20°C for 1.5h. Physically adsorbed CO2 was removed by flushing the sample with N2 gas for 1h at adsorption temperature. The heating rate was 20°C/min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of promoter on the performance of Ag/α-Al2O3 catalyst The influences of different promoters on the performance of silver catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene are listed in Table 1 . The results show that PO or other oxygen-containing by-products cannot be gained except for CO2 and H2O over the unmodified Ag/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The modification with rare earth metal oxide, alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides has an obvious influence on the efficiency of Ag/α-Al2O3 catalysts. After the catalyst is modified with K2O, BaO, or CaO, PO can be gained; over the catalyst modified with Y2O3, propanal and acetone can be gained. Adding 0.1wt% Y2O3 into Ag/K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst increases the selectivity to PO from 4.3% to 46.8%. For the Ag/BaO/α-Al2O3 or Ag/CaO/α-Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of 0.1wt% Y2O3 affects hardly their catalytic performance. The influences of Y2O3, K2O, BaO and CaO loading on the catalytic performance of Ag/α-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 1 . There is a maximum of the selectivity to PO with an increase in the promoter loading. When 0.1wt% K2O is added into the Ag/α-Al2O3 catalyst, the maximum selectivity to PO is 8.0% with 4.3% conversion of propylene; as the loading of BaO is 1%, the highest selectivity to PO is 2.5% with 3.1% conversion of propylene; as the loading of CaO is 0.5wt%, the highest selectivity to PO is 1.7% with 1.6% conversion of propylene. As a single additive, the promoting efficiency is K2O>BaO>CaO, and Y2O3 is almost ineffective. When a small quantity of Y2O3 is added into the Ag–(0.1%)K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst, the conversion of propylene decreases to half and the PO selectivity increases noticeably. These results indicate that Y2O3 and K2O may play a role as cooperative electron-type promoters, and affect the electronic density of the adjacent silver atoms that produce the proper adsorbed oxygen species to inhibit the total oxidation of propylene, resulting in obvious enhancement of the PO selectivity. The effects of the reaction temperature on the propylene conversion and selectivity of PO over the Ag–Y2O3–K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst are listed in Table 2 . With the ascent of reaction temperature, the propylene conversion increases, and the PO selectivity reaches to the maximum 46.8% at 245°C and then sharply decreases. At >300°C, PO is totally oxidized to CO2 and H2O. 3.2 Effect of α-Al2O3 support It is well known that the surface area and pore diameter distribution of α-Al2O3 support affect obviously the performance of supported silver catalyst for the epoxidation of ethylene. Four kinds of α-Al2O3 with different surface areas and pore diameter distributions were used as the supports of Ag catalyst. Their surface areas and pore diameter distribution curves are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2 , respectively. The results in Table 3 show that, with the increase in the surface area of support, the conversion of C3H6 and selectivity to PO increase. When the surface area of support is larger than 3.2m2/g, the selectivity to PO is hardly changed (45.5%–46.8%) and a small amount of by-products containing oxygen is formed. As shown in Fig. 2, the pore diameter of support (A) is about 1.3μm, and the pore diameters of support (B–D) are only 0.1–0.15μm, and the pore sizes of supports reduce with an increase in their surface areas. Conventionally, α-Al2O3 support with large pore (∼1μm) had higher selectivity to ethylene oxide for the epoxidation of ethylene. However, the pore diameters of the support (B), (C) and (D) distribute in 0.08–0.4μm and their most probable pore diameters are 0.1–0.15μm. Correlation of the surface areas and pore diameters of α-Al2O3 supports with the epoxidation performances of the catalysts indicates that the surface area of α-Al2O3 support is a key factor in improving the conversion of propylene and the PO selectivity. 3.3 Effect of the calcination temperature of modified α-Al2O3 support The effects of the calcination temperature of modified α-Al2O3 on the performance of 20% Ag/0.1% Y2O3–0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 (wt%) catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene are shown in Fig. 3 . With an increase in the calcination temperature of modified α-Al2O3 from 450 to 800°C, the conversion of propylene and the selectivity to PO increase to the maximum, and then decrease. When the support is calcined at 550°C, the catalyst shows the best epoxidation performance, in which the propylene conversion is 4.0% and the selectivity to PO is 46.8%. The SEM micrographs of α-Al2O3, 0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 and 0.1% Y2O3–0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 calcined at different temperatures for 2h are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a shows that bare α-Al2O3 has a rather structureless surface with some floccule-crystals. When K2O-modified α-Al2O3 is calcined at 550°C, large (0.3–0.6μm) and small (0.05–0.1μm) particles exist simultaneously (Fig. 4b). On the surface (Fig. 4c) of Y2O3–K2O/α-Al2O3 calcined at 550°C, there are some small nearly spherical particles (0.1–0.2μm). When Y2O3–K2O/α-Al2O3 is calcined at 800°C, its surface morphology (Fig. 4d) is changed compared with Fig. 4c; the spherical particles of 0.1–0.2μm accumulates to result in an increase (0.2–0.6μm) in the particle sizes and pores, and a reduction of surface area, which leads to a decline of catalytic performance (Fig. 3). The above results indicate that Y2O3 is structure-type promoter and can effectively restrain the surface sintering of modified α-Al2O3. 3.4 Effect of Y2O3 on Ag crystallite size Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of 20% Ag/0.1% Y2O3–0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 and 20% Ag/0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3. The diffraction peaks of Y2O3 or K2O cannot be observed due to their low loadings. The diffraction peaks of α-Al2O3 support are located at 2θ (°)=25.6, 35.2, 43.4, 52.6, 57.5, 66.5 and 68.2. There are four diffraction peaks of Ag at 2θ (°)=38.1, 44.3, 64.4 and 77.4, corresponding to the crystal faces of Ag(111), (200), (220) and (311), respectively for two samples. The intensities of Ag diffraction peaks of the catalyst (A) are slightly higher compared with (B). The crystallite size of Ag was estimated by Scherrer's equation and the full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak of Ag(111). Ag crystallites of catalyst (A) are larger than those of catalyst (B), and the presence of 0.1% Y2O3 makes the Ag crystallite size decrease from 17.4 to 15.7nm. It shows that a small quantity of Y2O3 can effectively regulate the size of Ag crystallite to restrain agglomeration. Zemichael and co-workers [30] suggested that there was a correlation between K2O loading and Ag particle size for the Ag/CaCO3 catalyst, and found that higher K2O loadings caused extensive agglomeration of the individual Ag crystallites and that the catalysts containing Ag crystallites size of 20–40nm gave maximum PO yields. However, Lu et al. [31] claimed that the addition of NaCl increased the size of silver particles for the Ag/CaCO3 catalyst, and found that Ag particles of 400–700nm gave the highest selectivity to PO. The above results indicate that K2O and NaCl can accelerate the agglomeration of Ag crystallites. The effect of different Ag crystallites sizes on its catalytic performance might be ascribed to the different promoters and preparation methods. 3.5 CO2-TPD The CO2-TPD curves of the modified supports and catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . In the CO2-TPD curves of the samples A–C, there is a desorption peak at near 820°C, that is, the samples A–C have some strong basic sites on their surface. For 20% Ag/α-Al2O3 (D) and α-Al2O3 (E) samples, there is no desorption peak of CO2, that is, no surface basic sites. This shows that modified α-Al2O3 with alkali metal oxide possesses some strong surface basic sites. When 0.1wt% Y2O3 is added into 0.1% K2O/α-Al2O3 (B), a small shoulder peak is observed at about 720°C and the desorption peak at 820°C reduces obviously, that is, the strong basic sites decrease. The Ag/Y2O3–K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst (C) has two desorption peaks at 790 and 820°C, and the peak at 720°C has been included in the broad peak of 630–790°C. The peak at 790°C can be ascribed to the interaction between Ag particles and basic sites. It is concluded that the suitable basic sites are necessary to a highly effective Ag catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene. 4 Conclusion Modified Ag/α-Al2O3 with Y2O3 and K2O is a highly effective catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene to PO. The physicochemical properties of α-Al2O3 support affect the performance of the Ag/Y2O3–K2O/α-Al2O3 catalyst. For the α-Al2O3 support, the most probable pore diameters distribution at 0.1–0.15μm and higher surface area are appropriate to the supported Ag catalyst. The suitable basic sites are necessary to a highly effective Ag catalyst for the epoxidation of propylene. The presence of a small quantity of Y2O3 in the Ag catalyst can adjust its surface basic sites and evidently improve its performance. As a structure-type promoter, Y2O3 can restrain the sintering of Ag particles on the surface of α-Al2O3.
