In the case of internal alkenes, the ci's isomer was primarily used as the reactant. The effects of the structures of n-alkenes on reaction behaviors, reactivity and stereo selectivity of the reaction products were investigated. The catalyst appeared to be very selective and active for each metathesis. The selectivities of the main product and byproducts in the homometathesis were >94% and <6%, respectively. The byproducts were accompanied by the cometathesis of a reactant, with the isomer being formed by a double bond shift to the interior. Relative reactivity was investigated by competitive reactions. Reactivity of a homogeneous series decreased as the size of the molecule became larger. The reactivity of n-alkenes with the same number of carbon atoms decreased in the following sequence: 2- > 3- > 4- > 1-alkene. The reaction products consisted of cis and trans isomers. The t/c ratio of products changed greatly according to the degree of conversion. The (t/c)o was greater than unity and increased with an increase in the alkyi chain length (R). When R remained constant, (t/c)o decreased with an increase in the carbon number in R'. Reactivity and stereochemistry are discussed and explained in terms of the metal carbene mechanism. Introduction Among a number of heterogeneous catalysts for olefin metathesis, Re207-Al203 catalysts are known to be selective and active at milder reac- tion conditions. We have found that the selectivity to 5-decene in the metathesis of 1-hexene was improved by the addition of a small amount of cesium nitrate to a Re207-A403 catalyst [1]. The CsN03-Re207-Al203 catalyst was further applied to the metathesis of a, (*;-dienes [2] and 1,4- 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 158 alkadienes [3, 4], and it appeared to be a very active and selective catalyst. Undesirable side reactions such as polymerization, double bond shift isomeri- zation, and subsequent metathesis occurred to only a small extent in these reactions. This indicates that the reaction behavior and reactivities of olefins can be revealed more accurately by the use of such a selective catalyst. The olefin metathesis reaction has been carried out with many olefins of different types over various kinds of both heterogeneous and homoge- neous catalysts. However, little is known about the correlation between the structures of olefins and their reactivities. Only one relevant study on the reactivities of 1-alkenes in a batch system in the liquid phase has been published [5]. In the present work, the effects of the molecular structures of linear olefins on the reactivities, product distributions and stereoselectivity of reaction products were investigated systematically. Fourteen kinds of l-, 2-, 3- and 4-alkenes containing from five to nine carbon atoms were metathesized for this purpose. Cis-alkenes were mainly used, as it has been reported that the geometric isomers of alkenes greatly influence the reactiv- ities and stereochemistry of the reaction products [6-9]. The reactions were carried out in the liquid phase with a continuous-flow system at atmospheric pressure using a CsN03-Re207-Al203 catalyst. Experimental Catalyst A Re207-Al203 catalyst was prepared by impregnating J-Al^Oy, ob- tained from an alumina sol, with an aqueous solution of rhenia. A CsN03- Re207-Al203 catalyst was prepared by impregnating the calcined Re207- A12O3 with an aqueous solution of cesium nitrate. The calculated amount of cesium nitrate was 1 wt.% as cesium metal ion. The concentration of Re207 in the final calcined catalyst was found to be 17.5 wt.%. The details of the catalyst preparation were described previously [1, 3]. Reagents 1-Heptene and cis-2-hexene (ci's: 99.5%, trans: 0.5%) were obtained from Tohkaseiki Co. 1-Pentene, cis-2-pentene (cis: 98.2%, trans: 1.8%), cis-2-heptene (ci's: 96%, trans: 4%), cis-2-octene (cis: 97.4%, trans: 2.6%), ci's-2-nonene (ci's: 96.5%, trans: 3.5%), cis-3-heptene (cis: 95.7%, trans: 4.3%), cis-3-octene (cis: 95.8%, trans: 4.2%), cis-3-nonene (cis: 99.5%, trans: 0.5%), mix-4-nonene (a mixture of cis and trans isomers) (cis: 21.3%, trans: 78.7%) and 1-nonene were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Co. These reactants were used without any further treatment and their purities were each >99%. 1-Hexene (Aldrich) and 1-octene (Tokyo Kasei Co.) were dried over molecular sieve 5A and purified in a stream of dry nitrogen by distilla- tion from the sieve prior to use. Monochlorobenzene as a solvent and toluene as a internal standard to calculate the percentage of conversion and selectivity were purified by rectification from P 20 5 prior to use. 159 Experimental procedure The experiments were carried out in the liquid phase in a single path continuous-flow system with a fixed catalyst bed in a tubular Pyrex glass reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was activated in situ at 550 C for 1.5 h in a stream of nitrogen prior to the reaction. The concentration of the reactant was usually 3.4 mol%. A sebaconitrile glass capillary column (30 m) and a silicone OV-101 chemical bonded capillary column (50 m) were used. The trans isomer of all authentic samples was eluted earlier than the ci's isomer in both columns. Thus, the earlier eluent was regarded as a trans isomer for the reaction products when authentic samples were not available. Further details of experimental procedures and analytical methods have been described in previous papers [1-4]. Results and discussion Metathesis of 1-alkenes 'Homometathesis of a series of 1-alkenes was carried out. As an example of the typical metathesis of 1-alkenes, the results of 1-pentene are shown in Fig. 1. The selectivity to 4-octene was 99%. 2-Hexene and 3-heptene were produced to only a smaller extent, in approximately equimolar amounts. This shows that the double bond isomerization of 1-pentene to 2-pentene occurred to a small extent and that such byproducts were accompanied by their cometatheses. 2-Butene and 3-hexene, homometathesis products of 2-pentene, were not detected in the products. The results of gaseous analyses are also shown in Fig. 1. Propene was formed in a small amount at the initial stage of the reaction, but decreased rapidly with time on stream. The propene/ethene ratio attained a nearly constant value of ca. 0.02 for 1- pentene. 20 30 40 50 Time on stream (min) Fig. 1. Metathesis of 1-pentene.

Other 1-alkenes behaved m almost the same way as 1-pentene. The results for a series of 1-alkenes are summarized m Table 1. The almost con- stant propene^ethene ratios attained were ca. 0.02 for 1-hexene, 0.005 for 1-heptene and 1-octene, and ~0 for 1-nonene. Metathesis of cis-2-alkenes Typical results for the metathesis of ci's-2-hexene are shown m Fig. 2. Small quantities of 2-pentene and 3-heptene, co metathesis products between 161 2-hexene and 3-hexene, were produced in almost equimolecular amounts. However, cometathesis products between 2-hexene and 1-hexene, 2-heptene and 4-nonene, were not found in the reaction products. 2-Butene was found only in gas analyses, and neither ethylene nor propylene was detected. Metathesis of a series of cis-2-alkenes showed almost the same tendency as that shown by cis-2-hexene. The results are summarized in Table 1. Byproducts were always cometathesis products between the 2- and 3- alkenes. This shows that the double bond shift isomerization of the 2-alkene occurred not to the 1-isomer, but almost exclusively to the 3-alkene. The selectivities to the main products exceeded 94%, but they were lower than those found for 1-alkenes. Metathesis of cis-3-alkenes As an example of a typical metathesis of cis-3-alkenes, the results for cis-3-octene are shown in Fig. 3. The main products were 3-hexene and 5-decene. 3-Heptene and 4-nonene, cometathesis products between 3-octene and 4-octene, were each produced with 1% selectivity. 2-Pentene, 5- undecene, 2-heptene and 3-nonene, cometathesis products of 3-octene with 2-octene, were not detected. The metatheses of other 3-alkenes were similar to that of 3-octene. The activity decreased rapidly in the metathesis of ct's-3-octene, but the activity change was small for other cis-3-alkenes. The results for the meta- thesis of 3-alkenes are summarized in Table 1. Only a small amount of cometathesis products occurring between the 3- and 4-alkenes were observed as byproducts. This demonstrates that the double bond shift isomerization of 3-alkenes occurred exclusively to 4-alkenes. Metathesis of 4-nonene Equimolecular amounts of 4-octene and 5-decene were produced without byproducts in the metathesis of cis-4-nonene (ci's: 98.9%, trans: 1.1%, Tokyo Kasei Co.). However, the selectivity was only 75% and the mass balance was not good. Furthermore, the activity of the catalyst de- creased greatly with time on stream. The purified cis-4-nonene, obtained by passage through a silica, magnesia or alumina column, or by distillation from sodium metal, was metathesized but the results were almost the same, without clear changes in behavior. However, in the metathesis of a mixture of cis and trans isomers of 4-nonene (mix-4-nonene), equimolecular amounts of 4-octene and 5-decene were produced with 100% selectivity. The activity of the catalyst was higher and the activity decrease was less than those experienced in the metathesis of cis-4-nonene. Metathesis of mix-2-alkenes (mixtures of cis and trans isomers) It has been reported that the reactivities of cis and trans isomers differ greatly. Trans-2-pentene alone was inactive [6, 7] and the rate of metathesis of the trans isomer was usually lower than that of the cis isomer [7-9]. 162 The ci's-n-alkenes used in this study contained 0.5 ~ 4.3% trans isomer and mix-4-nonene contained 78.7% trans isomer. Therefore, the effect on the rate of the existence of the trans isomer in the reagents was examined. The metathesis of mix-2-alkenes containing 20 ~ 57% trans isomer, (2-pentene (cis: 71.1%, trans: 28.9%), 2-hexene (ci's: 43.4%, frans: 56.6%), 2-heptene (cis: 76.1%, trans: 23.9%), 2-octene (cis: 79.7%, trans: 20.3%), 2-nonene (cis: 67.7%, trans: 32.3%)), was carried out at W/F = 2.6, at 20 C for 2-pentene and at 31.5 C for other 2-alkenes. However, there were no definite differences in the reactivity and product distribution between cis-2-alkene and mix-2-alkene. This may have been caused by the higher content of the cis isomer in the mix-2-alkene. Reaction routes in the metathesis of n-alkenes The CsN03-Re207-Al203 catalyst showed high activity and selectivity Cor the metathesis of fourteen kinds of n-alkenes, as can be seen from Table 1. The selectivities of the main products and byproducts were >94% and <6%, respectively. The byproducts were accompanied by cometathesis between a reactant and the isomer formed by the double bond shift to the interior. A shift to the exterior seemed to be negligible within the limits of this experiment. Thus, the reaction routes can be expressed by a general equation, as shown in Fig. 4. Cometathesis The data on cometathesis are few, and a systematic study was not found in the literature. In this experiment, the reaction behavior and reactiv- ity of alkenes in cometathesis were investigated. An equimolecular mixture of two kinds of alkenes was metathesized. The concentration of each reactant was 1 mol%. p ==P -a-1 -b+1 p =c -a-1 -a-1 + C =C ~h-l-1 \" b+1 \"b+1 Product 0 r =p -a+1 -b-1 r =p ^b r a-1 a ^-l^b c =r \"a \"a+1 P =P -a+1 -'b-1 + ^+1=^ + r' =P \"b+1 a + C,=C, b b + p =p \"b-l \"b + c^cb + ^-l^b-l - > 94% ::::}- 6% Fig. 4.

(3) is degenerative, three kinds of liquid products will be produced through eqns. (1), (2) and (4). As a typical example, the results of the cometathesis of 1-hexene with 1-octene are shown m Fig. 5. Two kinds of homometathesis products and one cometathesis product were produced as liquids. 5-Decene, the lighter homometathesis product, was produced in a greater amount than the heavier 7-tetradecene. The former decreased and the latter increased gradually with an increase in W/F, conversion. This decrease seemed to correspond to a parallel increase in the other. The changes may have been caused by second- ary reactions among the reactants and the reaction products. Almost the same tendency as discussed above and as shown in Fig. 5 was observed for the cometathesis of 1-hexene and another 1-alkene. The liquid reaction products and the product distributions are summarized in Table 2. The amount of cometathesis product was always ca. 50% and was approximately equal to the sum of both homometathesis products. The difference in the distribution of the two homometathesis products increased as the difference in the molecular size of the starting alkenes increased. 5 --<D (I><D- 40 30 20 10 -<D- ^ -.\"' ^c ==c P\\^ 7 7 2345 W/F (g-cat-h/mol) 12345 W/F Cg-cat-h/mol) Fig. 5.

The amount of 4-octene produced was about 6 times greater than that of 5-decene, at the low conversion level, indicating that cis-2-hexene reacted at a greater rate than 1-hexene.

However, the amount of 1-pentene was slightly larger than that of 2-heptene at small values of W/F, and the ratio (2- heptene/1-pentene) decreased with an increase m conversion. This presum- ably was due to the secondary reactions of 2-heptene with reactants and products, themselves occurring through the higher reactivity of 2-heptene than that of 1-pentene. These changes in ratio and product distribution revealed the occurrence of secondary reactions with an increase in con- version. There was a fairly large difference in the selectivity of eqns. (6) and (7) as shown in Fig. 7. The 4-nonene produced from the combination between larger alkylidene moieties (eqn. (6)) was smaller than for 2- heptene (eqn. (7)) and the ratio of eqn. (6) to eqn. (7) was 0.64 at zero percent conversion. The results of the other cometatheses between 1-hexene and ci's-2- alkene are summarized in Table 2. The changes in product distribution, depending on conversion level, were similar to those found in the cometa- thesis of 1-hexene with ci's-2-hexene. Therefore, the initial data estimated by the extrapolation of the changes of product distributions to the intercept, at zero percent conversion, are used in the Table. More homometathesis product was produced from the 2-alkene than 5-decene from 1-hexene. The ratio of eqn. (6) to (7) was 0.62 ~ 0.65 at the low conversion level in the cometathesis of 1-hexene with cis-2-alkene. This value agreed closely with ca. 0.6 (C3=Cg /C2=Cg) obtained by the cometathesis of 1-nonene with ci's-2-pentene in a batch reactor [5]. 166 TABLE 3 Relative reactivity of ci's-alkenes Double bond position 1- 2- pentene 1.28 8.70 hexene 1.00 6.00 heptene 0.90 4.73 octene 0.66 3.50 nonene 0.44 2.55 3.55 - 2.78 - 2.03 1.30s1 ''Mixture of eis (21.3%) and trans (78.7%). Other cometatheses As an example, the results of the cometathesis of 1-hexene with ci's- 3-nonene are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2. All the predicted reaction prod- ucts were formed and the product distributions were reasonable, at least at low contact time. However, secondary reactions between reactants and reaction products occurred with an increase in contact time. The amount of conversion, and the product distribution deteriorated because of the dif- ferences in their reactivities. Cometathesis of further combination of two alkenes was carried out and the results are summarized in Table 2. The ratio of cometathesis products corresponding to eqn. (6)/eqn. (7) was 0.89 ~ 0.92. Reactivity of n-alkenes No systematic studies of the relation between the molecular structure and the reactivity of olefins have been reported, except for a, c^-dienes [2], 1,4-alkadienes [4] and 1-alkenes [5]. The relative reactivity of a series of n-alkenes was investigated by the competitive reaction technique. The results on the relative reactivity against 1-hexene are shown in Table 3. The reactivity of n-alkenes decreased with an increase in molecular size, that is, in the chain length of the alkyi substituent within a homologous series. The extent of the decrease was about 20 - 30% per one carbon atom increase. The relative reactivities of 1-alkenes were in fair agreement with the data obtained in the liquid phase with a batch reactor system by Naka- mura et al. [5]. As the size of the molecule increases, the available number of active sites on the catalyst will decrease because the area of the catalyst surface covered by a reactant molecule increases. Consequently, some of the decrease in reactivity may be caused by a decrease in the available number of active sites. The cross-sectional areas of molecules absorbed on solid surfaces were calculated [10] and the relative area was found to be as follows: l-hexene:l-heptene:l-octene:l-nonene = 1.00:1.08:1.16:1.21. This suggests that an increase of one carbon atom may decrease the reactivity by about 8%. 167 Productive RHC=CHR' + LnRe=CHR Degenerative I R' CH I II CH LnRe-.-ll CH /R\\R' RHC=CHR RHC-CHR ~^. +LnRe^CHR' Re LnKe Lnn LnRe- RHC=CHR' LnRe=CHR RHC=CHR' + LnRe=CHR 1' 2' R>R' Fig. 9. Two reaction pathways in homometathesis. Considering the data on the basis of the metathesis scheme, two pathways (productive and degenerative) result from the two possible ways of coordinating a reactant with a surface carbene (e.g. LnRe=CHR) as shown in Fig. 9. The reactivity of n-alkenes will be determined by the rate of the productive pathway. The key step governing the reaction rate must exist in the coordination step between the carbene and the n-alkene. The ratio of the rate of degenerative metathesis to the rate of produc- tive metathesis was 8.6 [11] and 2.4 - 3.5 [12] for propene, 15.7 for 1- butene [11] and 26 -155 for the mixture of l-octene-l,l-d2 and 1-hexene [13]. These data indicate that the ratio increases greatly with an increase in alkyi chain length, and that the repulsive interaction of the alkyi groups (R, R) in the intermediate 1, Fig. 9, is strong even if the alkyi groups are small. On the other hand, the steric interaction of the alkyi group (R) and the catalyst surface or the ligands on the transition metal in the intermediate 1 ', Fig. 9, is not great, compared with the interaction between R and R. The reactivity of n-alkenes of a homologous series decreased with an increase in the chain length of R. This must be caused by an increase in the repulsive interaction between R and R in the intermediate 1, resulting in the lower reactivity. The reactivity of n-alkenes with the same number of carbon atoms de- creased in the sequence 2-> 3-> 4-> 1-alkene, as can be seen in Table 3. The reactivity of 2- and 3-alkenes compared with 1-alkenes was 5 - 6 and ca. 4 times faster, respectively. With an increase of the chain length in R', the interaction between R and R decreases and that between R' and the catalyst surface increases. The data reveal that the increase in the latter interaction is larger than the decrease in the former interaction. This further 168 indicates that the interaction between the catalyst surface and R' is quite large even if R' is a small alkyi group such as methyl or ethyl. In the metathesis of n-alkenes to yield the same product, for example, 5-decene from 1-hexene, 2-heptene, 3-nonene or 4-octene, the reactivity of the reactants decreased as the molecular size increased, except for 1-alkenes. This suggests that the interaction between R' and the catalyst surface becomes stronger with an increase in R' alkyi chain length. The same order of the reactivity as described above was obtained. The order also agrees with the results obtained for the metathesis of 1,4-alkadienes [4]. The reactivity of 1-alkenes appeared to be abnormally slow compared with other n-alkenes as can be seen in Table 3. In the case of 1-alkenes, R' is H in Fig. 9. The interaction between R and H in the intermediate 1' is the least and degenerative metathesis will occur exclusively. For this reason the reactivity of 1-alkenes is the lowest. Stereochemistry of reaction products In studies on the stereochemistry of metathesis, propene and 2-pentene have been intensively investigated over various catalyst systems [14]. Unfortunately, only the stereoselectivity of 2-butene has been investigated in the metathesis of some higher 2-alkenes, rather than 2-pentene [14]. Little is known concerning the stereoselectivity of liquid products. It has been reported that the product 5-decene from 1-hexene occurs only as the trans isomer [5], and the initial trans/cis isomer ratio, (t/c)o, of 4-octene from 1-pentene had the values 2.0 [16] and 3.7 [5]. The initial Cts content in 3-hexene produced from cfs-2-pentene ranged from 48 to 73% [7, 9, 14, 15,17], that from 1-butene was 41% [14,16] and the value from trans-2- pentene ranged from zero to 18% [7, 9,14,17]. The ratios and the contents of the cto isomer cited above markedly changed with differences in the catalyst system and the nature of the reactant. The effect of the structure of the reactant on the stereoselectivity of the reaction product, and especially of the high molecular weight product, was investigated systematically in this study. As examples, results of the metathesis of 1-hexene and cis-2-heptene are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The t/c ratio increased markedly with an increase in the conversion or the t/c ratio of a reactant. Almost the same behavior was observed for other n- alkenes. The (t/c)o was estimated by extrapolating the curve to the intercept, i.e. to zero percent conversion or the t/c for [reactant] = 0. The data thus obtained are summarized in Table 4, from which the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) More trans isomer was produced than eis isomer, with the result that (fc/c)o>l independent of the molecular structure of the reactant. The content of ci's isomer in the product was 50% for 3-hexene [7], 33 - 42% for 4-octene, 29 - 36% for 5-decene, 29 - 33% for 6-dodecene and 30% for tetradecene. The isomeric structure of the reactant was not retained in the product when reactants giving rise to products larger than 4-octene were used. 169 W/F Temp.

(2) As the molecular size of the reactant with a double bond at the same position increased, i.e. as the molecular size of a reaction product increased, (t/c)o increased. (3) The (t/c)o values of the same reaction product obtained from different reactants (for example, 5-decene from 1-hexene, 2-heptene and 3-octene) were not constant. As the size of reactant became larger, the amount of ci's isomer in the product increased and thus (t/c)o decreased. The Stereoselectivity of the reaction products is determined by the relative stabilities of the substituted metallacyclobutane intermediates. The stabilities are governed by the repulsive interactions between the substitu- ents, and between the substituents and the catalyst surface. The four pos- 170 Fig. 12. Configurations of the puckered metallacyclobutane intermediate in the produc- tive metathesis of ci's-alkenes. sible configurations of the metallacyclobutane intermediates for the produc- tive metathesis starting with the ct's-alkene (R'CH=CHR, R > R') and the carbene species (Re=CHR) are shown in Fig. 12 [7]. The metallacyclo- butane intermediate has a puckered ring structure. Thus, the repulsive inter- action between the catalyst surface and the equatorial (e) alkyi groups on Cl and/or C3 will be strong, and the interaction between the diaxial (a-a) alkyi groups on Cl and C3 will be weak [7, 18]. The stereochemistry in the metathesis of 2-pentene over a Ress-,- A1203 catalyst has been investigated by Kapteijn and Mol [7]. Productive conformations which produce 2-butene in the metathesis of ci's-2-pentene can be obtained by replacing R and R' in Fig. 12 with methyl and ethyl groups, respectively. The eis isomer in 2-butene was 73% of the total prod- duct of isomers, ((t/c)o= 0.37) [7]. This indicates that the a-e interaction between methyl groups on Cl and C2 is weak, and that the interaction between the methyl and/or ethyl group of the e position on Cl and/or C3 and the catalyst surface is fairly strong, but it may be relatively small, at least in the case of the methyl group [18]. On the other hand, the a-a interaction between the methyl and ethyl groups on Cl and C3 is not large. Thus, the favorable order with respect to the metallacyclobutane inter- mediates must be as follows: I > IV > II > III. In the case the formation of 3-hexene from ci's-2-pentene, R and R' in Fig. 12 should be replaced by ethyl and methyl groups, respectively. The value of (t/c)o was unity [7]. The a-e interaction between the ethyl groups on Cl and C2 increases. The interaction between the equatorial ethyl group on Cl and the catalyst sur- face is fairly large, but structure IV might still substantially contribute to the productive metathesis. Thus, the ability to form the intermediates must be in the following order: I > II > IV > III. As R is larger than the propyi group in this study, the formation of both IV and III must be small, and the favored structures are I and II. On increasing the size of R, the a-e interaction between the substituents on Cl and C2 will increase for structure I. The interaction between the axial substituent on C2 and the catalyst surface will increase for structure II, but 171 TABLE 5 Estimation of degree of interactions Interaction Alkyi group Degree of interaction (Cl-o)(Cl-e) or (C3-e) + (C2-e)+ Catal. + Catal.

The most stable conformation of metallacyclobutane intermediate. this may not be large due to the magnitude of the separation between them. The data shown in Table 4 reveal that structure I becomes less favorable than II with increasing size of R. This means that the a-e steric restriction between substituents on Cl and C2 plays a dominating role in the stereo- chemistry of the reaction products, especially when alkyi groups are larger than propyl. When R was changed from ethyl to propyi, the value of (t/c)o increased drastically (60% increase). However, the amount of increase in (t/c)o gradually decreased for alkyi groups larger than butyl. The degree of interaction between the equatorial substituent on Cl or C3 and the catalyst surface might be revealed by comparing the data from reactions giving the same products (RCH=CHR) from different alkenes (R'CH=CHR), where R is constant and R' is varied. With an increase in the size of R', the a-a interactions between the R' on C3 and the R on Cl will become large for structure I, but must remain small for reasons already mentioned. For structure II, the interaction between the R' on C3 and the catalyst surface will become large. The data reveal that the interaction between R' and the catalyst surface increases on increasing the size of R', and this results in a decrease in the content of the trans isomer. For example, the frans content in 5-decene for R'=H, CHa and Cylis was 71, 67 and 64%, respectively, indicating that the trans isomer content decreased by a factor of ca. 5% per increase of one carbon atom in R'. 172 By taking the data and the discussions on stereoselectivity into account, a rough estimate of the relative magnitudes of the various interactions was made and the results are shown in Table 5. Not only the interactions dis- cussed above, but also the other various possible interactions between sub- stituents, and the substituents with the catalyst surface, should be con- sidered in order to arrive at a more precise estimation and/or interpretation of the results obtained for the stereoselectivity of the reaction products. However, it is difficult to evaluate the degree of the interactions separately because of their complexity. The most stable structure, depicted in Fig. 13, is formed from the interaction between a carbene species (M=CHR) and trans alkene (R'CH=CHR), producing a trans product. This is why the trans reactant yields a trans product with a greater structure-retaining selectivity [7, 14]. References 1 T. Kawai, Y. Yamazaki and A. Tokumura, Sekiyu Gakkaishi, 26 (1983) 332; T.

In the case of internal alkenes, the cis isomer was primarily used as the reactant. The effects of the structures of n-alkenes on reaction behaviors, reactivity and stereo selectivity of the reaction products were investigated. The catalyst appeared to be very selective and active for each metathesis. The selectivities of the main product and byproducts in the homometathesis were >94% and <6%, respectively. The byproducts were accompanied by the cometathesis of a reactant, with the isomer being formed by a double bond shift to the interior. Relative reactivity was investigated by competitive reactions. Reactivity of a homogeneous series decreased as the size of the molecule became larger. The reactivity of n-alkenes with the same number of carbon atoms decreased in the following sequence: 2- > 3- > 4- > 1-alkene. The reaction products consisted of cis and trans isomers. The t c ratio of products changed greatly according to the degree of conversion. The ( t c )o was greater than unity and increased with an increase in the alkyl chain length (R). When R remained constant, ( t c )o decreased with an increase in the carbon number in R'. Reactivity and stereochemistry are discussed and explained in terms of the metal carbene mechanism.
