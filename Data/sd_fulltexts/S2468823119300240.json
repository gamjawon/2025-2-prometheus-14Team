Graphical abstract In traditional Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, peracids or hydrogen peroxide are usually adopted as the oxidants. When molecular oxygen is used as oxidant, the sacrificial agents are always indispensable, such as aldehydes that are transformed into cheap acids after reaction. In this work, KA oil (the industrial raw material, a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) has been oxidized to caprolactone by molecular oxygen using N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) as catalyst, in which the sacrificial agent is cyclohexanol, and it is converted into cyclohexanone, then into caprolactone rather than into byproducts. The selectivity of caprolactone was 98% with cyclohexanol conversion of 34% and it was still kept at 90% when the conversion reached to 46%. The mechanism investigation showed a bifunctional role of CAN, which performed both as a radical initiator for cyclohexanol oxidation and a Lewis acid for Baeyer-Villiger reaction. In the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, a weak interaction between cerium and cyclohexanone was suggested by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), meanwhile, the active species generated from cerium and hydrogen peroxide was separated and characterized by FTIR. The detailed research also revealed an unusual effect between cerium and the Brønsted acid generated as a byproduct, which was critical for caprolactone synthesis. Keywords KA oil Baeyer-Villiger reaction Aerobic oxidation N-hydroxyphthalimide Cerium ammonium nitrate 1 Introduction Caprolactone is mainly used as a monomer for the manufacture of specialized polymers and its market demand is beyond 60 kilotons annually [1]. Since Baeyer-Villiger reaction was first reported in 1899 [2,3], it has become the highly valuable method for esters or lactones production from ketones. Instead of Caro’s acid (H2SO5) which was used by Baeyer and Villiger, current oxidants mainly consist of organic peracids (such as peracetic acid and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid) [4–6], hydrogen peroxide [7–10], and bis (trimethylsiyl) peroxide [11]. The high-cost, instability, shock sensitivity and potential explosiveness have seriously limited the applications of organic peracids. In recent years, various heterogeneous [12–14] and homogeneous [15–19] catalysts have been reported for Baeyer-Villiger reaction with hydrogen peroxide, which is a highly promising oxidant for its low-price, moderate activity and environmental friendliness. Corma [12] synthesized Sn-zeolite beta as a heterogeneous catalyst for Baeyer-Villiger oxidations which showed good catalytic performance. Titanium silicate molecular sieve (TS-1) has also been found to be an excellent catalyst assisted with H2O2 [20]. In addition to the catalyst, the solvent could also play a key role in Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Berkessel et al. [21] studied the Baeyer-Villiger reaction in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and found cyclohexanone could be quantitatively transformed into caprolactone with the help of p-TsOH, a relatively strong Brønsted acid. The molecular oxygen has also been applied in Baeyer-Villiger oxidation successfully, yet sacrificial agents are indispensable. For examples, when the acetaldehyde was used as sacrificial agent, the peracetic was in situ produced from excess acetaldehyde oxidation with the molecular oxygen, then the Baeyer-Villiger reaction occurs between cyclohexanone and peracetic acid [22–25]. After the pioneer work of Mukaiyama et al [26], a plenty of catalysts with activity for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation have been promoted [27–30]. Although the oxygen is used as the terminal oxidant in this strategy, the tremendous acetaldehyde consumption and large cheap acid generation appear to be the major drawbacks. Another sacrificial agent, the alcohol, was used by Ishii et al. [31]. They used oxygen as oxidant and NHPI/2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) /InCl3 as catalysts to synthesis caprolactone from KA oil, and the in situ produced hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and cyclohexanol acted as the actual oxidant. It should also be noted that the formation of hydrogen peroxide during the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by NHPI had been studied in an earlier work by Ishii [32]. This new strategy has been receiving much attention over the past years, however, it also leaves room for improvement. Inspired by Ishii and coworkers, herein we report a new strategy which is easy to conduct in one pot to produce caprolactone from KA oil using molecular oxygen (Scheme 1 ). A good selectivity of caprolactone can be readily reached under mild reaction conditions. The facile and high active catalyst was composed of NHPI and CAN which is abundant on earth [33]. To our surprise, the CAN played a bifunctional role in this reaction, which catalyzed not only the cyclohexanol oxidation as a radical initiator but also the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation as a Lewis acid. The mechanism research also revealed a unique synergistic catalysis effect originated from a byproduct and cerium. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials NHPI (98.5%), Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 (98%), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), HFIP (98%), biphenyl (99%), p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (p-TsOH·H2O, 98%), cyclohexanol (99%) and cyclohexanone (99%), 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (97%) were purchased from Energy Chemical. Acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99%), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (30%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the reagents were used directly without further purification. The ultrapure water was produced by Master-S UV laboratory water purification system. 2.2 Oxidation The aerobic oxidation proceeded in a 100 mL three-necked round bottom flask with a magnetic stirring bar in it. After the reagents were added, the flask was purged with pure oxygen for three times by a membrane pump, after which it was heated to 45℃ by oil bath. The reaction was monitored by a Shimadzu gas chromatography instrument (GC-2010) equipped with a capillary column (HP-1, 30 m length, 0.25 mm diameter, 0.25 μm film) and a FID detector. Biphenyl was used as the internal standard compound. For the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and cyclohexanone, a 25 mL single-necked flask was used while other conditions remained unchanged. GC–MS tests were conducted with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 instrument. For the reaction exploring water content effect, one equivalent water (compared to cyclohexanol) was added at certain time, the other conditions remained unchanged. Spiro-bisperoxide (7,8,15,16-tetraoxadispiro[5.2.5.2]hexadecane) was prepared according to the paper [38] demonstration. The rearrangement of spiro-bisperoxide proceeded in a 25 mL single-necked flask with 5 mol% catalyst added. 2.3 Characterization The hydrogen peroxide measurement was performed according to previous paper [34]. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted with ThermoFisher Scientific NICOLET iS10 instrument. Solid sample was tested as KBr pellets while liquid sample was tested as a film on the CaF2 salt tablet. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum was recorded by a Bruker cw-EPR spectrometer (A300) at X band. The modulation frequency was 100 KHz and power of microwave was 2 mw. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests were conducted on Bruker AVANCE III 500 instrument, 1H NMR at 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 125 MHz. Elemental analysis result was obtained by Elementar Vario MICRO cube. A portable pH meter was used to test the pH variation of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid with cerium nitrate. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Aerobic oxidation of KA oil to caprolactone with in situ produced hydrogen peroxide KA oil is composed of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol which is generated from aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane [35,36]. Herein, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were mixed at certain percentage to simulate the KA oil [1] for the discussion of ratio effect. We attempted to couple the H2O2 preparation from aerobic oxidation of cyclohexanol and the H2O2 utilization for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone in one pot. Table 1 presents the results for aerobic oxidation of KA oil under various conditions (Scheme 1). As the reaction progressed, the chemical substances showed a decrease of cyclohexanol (1) along with the increase of cyclohexanone (2) and caprolactone (3). Under the optimized conditions (Entry 2), almost quantitive caprolactone was obtained until 34% cyclohexanol was oxidized. Thereafter, cyclohexanone started to increase (Sel.% = 2%) while the selectivity of caprolactone holds to 90% based on a 46% conversion of cyclohexanol at 37 h. The oxidization of cyclohexanol became slow and caprolactone selectivity dropped significantly in the later stage (see supplementary material). Beside the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with the in situ produced hydrogen peroxide, the cyclohexanone was also oxidized by the molecular oxygen. In the absence of cyclohexanol (Entry 11), no hydrogen peroxide was generated, cyclohexanone was converted to caprolactone at a low selectivity catalyzed, and oxepane-2,7-dione (Sel.% = 20%) was recognized as the main byproduct (Scheme 2 ). As a result of the unwanted reaction, the selectivity of caprolactone slightly decreased when the catalyst amount (Entries 3, 4) and the ratio of cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol (Entry 7) were increasing. On the other hand, the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone proceeded smoothly with only 3 mol% catalyst (Entry 1), yet barely caprolactone was generated. The absence of caprolactone could be explained that almost all of the catalyst was occupied by cyclohexanol while none participated in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. This result may imply a bifunctional role of the catalyst. Although excess cyclohexanone gave rise to an inferior selectivity of caprolactone, it was important to keep an adequate ratio of cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol (Entries 5, 6). The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is an inevitable problem during its reaction, less cyclohexanone may lead to a low efficient utilization of hydrogen peroxide which was in situ produced from the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexanol. To our delight, when 10 mol% catalyst was used, the selectivity of caprolactone was as good as 67% at the end of the reaction (Entry 3). HFIP is a highly polar solvent as well as a strong hydrogen-bond donor [37]. Inspired by Berkessel and coworkers [21], we chose HFIP as the solvent for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation and acetonitrile as the solvent for cyclohexanol aerobic oxidation. Both solvents were indispensable for the caprolactone production (Entries 8, 10), furthermore, the combination of these two solvents should be kept at an appropriate ratio. No reaction occurred without acetonitrile (Entry 8), while the selectivity of caprolactone was apparently lower if the amount of acetonitrile was too much (Entry 9). 3.2 The negative influence of water The formation of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, which was facile to polymerize, was observed as a major byproduct (GC–MS, see supplementary material) in KA oil oxidation. Caprolactone was proved to be stable in this reaction, which would not be hydrolyzed to 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (HHA). As suggested by Berkessel [38], this byproduct could be derived from the hydrolysis of intermediate (Scheme 3 ) during the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone. To clarify its negative influence, we employed extra water and compared the selectivity of caprolactone at different stages. The hydrolysis clearly impaired the selectivity of caprolactone no matter the addition of the water was carried out at the beginning or in the middle of the reaction (Fig. 1 ). In conclusion, the selectivity of caprolactone dropped with the accumulation of water during the aerobic oxidation of KA oil. 3.3 Cerium as an efficient catalyst for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation Lewis acids had been proved to be the efficient catalysts for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with hydrogen peroxide [21,27–30]. In 2004, CAN was discovered to be an outstanding catalyst for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of steroids with peracids which were more active than hydrogen peroxide [39]. During the optimization of reaction conditions, we found the oxidation of KA oil reached a better selectivity of caprolactone without p-TsOH which was recognized as a necessary catalyst in the presumed reaction mechanism [21]. Thus, we separately conducted the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone with hydrogen peroxide (30%) using cerium as catalyst. Table 2 shows the comparison of catalytic performance of p-TsOH and various Lewis acids. To our delight, the cerium exhibited an unexpected efficiency which was even better than p-TsOH [21] and Sn-zeolite beta [12]. 3.4 Mechanism of aerobic oxidation of KA oil to caprolactone After the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation was reported, its mechanism had been investigated comprehensively. The classical “Criegee intermediate” mechanism [40] and a nonclassical mechanism [38] which must employ a Brønsted acid as catalyst had been both proposed. With the help of spectroscopic methods, we endeavored to investigate the mechanism of the one-pot aerobic oxidation of KA oil. NHPI is a versatile organocatalyst for CH activation which is with a general efficiency [41]. It usually works as a precursor of phthalimido-N-oxyl radical (PINO), which is able to abstract hydrogen atom from substrate and initiates the free radical processes [42–48]. The catalyst precipitate of the KA oil oxidation was tested by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) which presented the signal of PINO radical (g = 2.006, aN = 4.76 G) [49]. While no CAN was added, the reaction system was EPR-silent (see supplementary material). We speculated the PINO species was produced through the electron transfer from NHPI to CAN, as CAN was known for its property to participate in one-electron transfer reactions [36]. The performance of Lewis acid catalyst in Baeyer-Villiger oxidation was related to its acidity, which affected their ability to activate hydrogen peroxide or ketones [50,51]. We employed FTIR to investigate the interaction between cerium and cyclohexanone (Fig. 2 ) which showed an 8 cm−1 shift of the carbonyl group absorption peak toward lower wavenumber. Compared with the 48 cm−1 shift when the catalyst was Sn-zeolite beta [12], the smaller shift indicated a weaker activation of carbonyl group by cerium. We assumed the excellent catalytic performance of cerium was not majorly through the activation of cyclohexanone. On the other hand, when cerium was mixed with hydrogen peroxide, an orange solid different from the original catalyst was observed. Furthermore, after the reaction was completed, the color of catalyst changed from orange to white. The orange solid was separated and its FTIR spectrum was shown in Fig. 3 which clearly inferred a structure of CeOOH. The peak at 1433 cm−1 was corresponded to CeOOH [52] bond and absorption at 825 cm−1 was assigned to the CeOOH bond [53]. It is known that the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with hydrogen peroxide proceeds according to a nonclassical mechanism [38] when HFIP acts as the appointed solvent. However, Brønsted acid was needed, both for the formation of spiro-bisperoxide (7,8,15,16-tetraoxadispiro[5.2.5.2]hexadecane) and its rearrangement to caprolactone. Furthermore, a low pKa value of the Brønsted acid appeared to be necessary. We have synthesized the spiro-bisperoxide species and studied its rearrangement process. The catalytic performance of cerium nitrate accompanied with HHA [38] was shown in Scheme 4 . To our surprise, the combination of the weak Brønsted acid and cerium showed an excellently catalytic activity, but no activity was observed when they were used individually. This suggested a unique synergistic catalysis from reaction byproduct and catalyst in Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. It could be explained by the improvement of Brønsted acidity of HHA after its interaction with cerium (Fig. 4 ). With more cerium was added, the pH value of HHA solution was approaching that of the p-TsOH which showed the best catalytic performance for spiro-bisperoxide rearrangement [38]. Based on the spectroscopic results and control experiments, a plausible mechanism of aerobic oxidation of KA oil (Scheme 5 ) was proposed. Firstly, the active PINO radical, produced from NHPI and CAN, abstracted a hydrogen atom from the α-position of cyclohexanol, and then the yielded cyclohexanol radical was in turn adducted by molecular oxygen to generate a peroxide species, which decomposed into cyclohexaone and hydrogen peroxide as suggested by Ishii [32,43]. The produced hydrogen peroxide was not reactive enough for the nucleophilic addition to cyclohexanone, however it was facile to interact with cerium leading to the formation of cerium peroxo species as it was shown in FTIR spectrum. Eventually, attacked by the generated cerium peroxo species, two cyclohexanones were transformed into the spiro-bisperoxide intermediate, which subsequently rearranged to caprolactone, with the help of both cerium and HHA. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have adopted the cheap and available industrial material KA oil as substrate and molecular oxygen as oxidant to produce caprolactone with NHPI and CAN as catalyst. The advantage is that the cyclohexanol, unlike previous sacrificial agents that were transformed into byproducts, was oxidized to cyclohexanone, which was subsequently employed as the substrate for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of caprolactone was kept at 98% when the conversion of cyclohexanol reached 34%. This holds the promising industrial potential because the unconverted cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone can be easily distillated from product and then reused as substrates. The attractive finding is that the cerium could not only perform as a good radical initiator but also activate the hydrogen peroxide for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with an excellent efficiency. Besides, the synergistic catalysis of cerium and byproduct (HHA) was rarely reported in the literature and present the uniqueness of this catalyst system. Replacing the expensive solvent HFIP, development of more efficient alcohols and expansion of application scope are currently underway in our lab.

        "dc:description": "In traditional Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, peracids or hydrogen peroxide are usually adopted as the oxidants. When molecular oxygen is used as oxidant, the sacrificial agents are always indispensable, such as aldehydes that are transformed into cheap acids after reaction. In this work, KA oil (the industrial raw material, a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) has been oxidized to caprolactone by molecular oxygen using N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) as catalyst, in which the sacrificial agent is cyclohexanol, and it is converted into cyclohexanone, then into caprolactone rather than into byproducts. The selectivity of caprolactone was 98% with cyclohexanol conversion of 34% and it was still kept at 90% when the conversion reached to 46%. The mechanism investigation showed a bifunctional role of CAN, which performed both as a radical initiator for cyclohexanol oxidation and a Lewis acid for Baeyer-Villiger reaction. In the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, a weak interaction between cerium and cyclohexanone was suggested by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), meanwhile, the active species generated from cerium and hydrogen peroxide was separated and characterized by FTIR. The detailed research also revealed an unusual effect between cerium and the Brønsted acid generated as a byproduct, which was critical for caprolactone synthesis.",
