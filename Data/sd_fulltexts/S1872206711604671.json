DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60467-1 ARTICLE Influence of Mn/(Mn+Ce) Ratio of MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 Monolith Catalyst on Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO x with Ammonia XU Haidi, FANG Zhitao, CAO Yi, KONG Shuang, LIN Tao a , GONG Maochu, CHEN Yaoqiang b Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology of the Ministry of Education, College of chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: A series of monolith MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts with different mass ratios of Mn/(Mn+Ce) were prepared and used for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with NH 3 in the presence of excess O 2 . The catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption, oxygen storage capacity, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NH 3 /NO temperature-programmed desorption, and H 2 temperature-programmed reduction. The best catalyst had the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5. It gave 90% NO x conversion in the range of 173ï€­355 ÂºC at the gas hourly space velocity of 10000 h ï€­1 , and characterization results showed that a higher oxidation activity of NO to NO 2 , more surface Ce and Mn with a larger Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio, lower NH 3 and NO desorption temperatures, and excellent redox ability were together responsible for its best NH 3 -SCR performance. Key words: manganese; cerium; selective catalytic reduction of NH 3 ; nitrogen oxide; mass ratio Automobiles and fossil fuel combustion generate nitrogen oxides (NO x ), which are air pollutants with adverse effects, including photochemical smog, acid rain, ozone depletion, greenhouse effects, and causing respiratory diseases [1]. Many countries limit NO x emission. The selective catalytic reduction of NO x with ammonia (NH 3 -SCR) in the presence of excess O 2 is a technology widely used to remove NO x from coal-fired power plants and automobiles [2]. V 2 O 5 -WO 3 (MoO 3 )/TiO 2 is the most common commercial catalyst but it has high catalytic activity and SO 2 tolerance only in a narrow reaction window of 300ï€­400 Â°C [3,4]. Consequently, a SCR catalyst with an ex- cellent low temperature performance and a wide reaction window is still needed for desulfurization equipment and electrostatic precipitators. MnO x is the active component often used to promote low temperature SCR activity [5ï€­10]. CeO 2 is an additive compo- nent to enhance the oxidization of NO to NO 2 in the NH 3 -SCR reaction because it can store and release oxygen by the Ce 3+ -Ce 4+ redox pair [11ï€­13]. Many works have reported on the catalytic performance of the synergism between MnO x and CeO 2 [14ï€­17]. Qi et al. [15ï€­18] investigated the relationship between the mole fraction of MnO x and CeO 2 on MnO x -CeO 2 powder catalysts, and reported that the catalyst with the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mole fraction of 0.4 possessed the best NH 3 -SCR catalytic activity. However, the ratio is different for Mn/(Mn+Ce) loaded on different carriers. So the studying of the effect of Mn/(Mn+Ce) ratio on other carriers is significant. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of different WO 3 contents of MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 monolith catalysts on the NH 3 -SCR reaction [19], and showed that the catalyst with 10 wt% WO 3 for WO 3 -ZrO 2 gave excellent NH 3 -SCR performance in a broad reaction temperature window. In order to further investigate the effect of the active compoments on the SCR of NO x with NH 3 , in this work, a series of MnO x -CeO 2 /10 wt% WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts with dif- ferent Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratios were prepared. Their activities for the NH 3 -SCR reaction were investigated together with their characterization. XU Haidi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1927â€“1937 1 Experimental 1.1 Carrier preparation The 10 wt% WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier was prepared by the co-precipitation method from ammonium metatungstate (AR grade, 99%, Anda, Jiangyan, China) and zirconyl nitrate hy- drate (AR grade, 99%, Yutai, Shangdong, China) using the appropriate mass ratio. The precursors were mixed in an aqueous solution and a buffer solution of ammonia solution (3 mol/L) and ammonia-carbonate aqueous solution (3 mol/L) were added dropwise until the pH value reached approximately 9. The precipitate obtained was dried at 70 Â°C for 24 h, and then calcined at 550 Â°C for 3 h in air to get the 10 wt% WO 3 -ZrO 2 . 1.2 Catalyst preparation The prepared 10 wt% WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier was used with Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 Â·4H 2 O (AR grade, 99%, Kemiou, Tianjin, China) and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O (AR grade, 99%, Jinshan, Chengdu, China) as the precursors of MnO x and CeO 2 , re- spectively. MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts with different Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratios (Mn and Ce denoted the metal ox- ides) were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalyst was calcined at 550 Â°C for 3 h in air. Some water was added to the prepared catalyst powder and this was mixed to form a uniform slurry that was coated on hon- eycomb cordierites (cylinder, diameter: 11 mm, length: 26 mm, bulk: 2.5 cm 3 , 62 cell/cm 2 , Corning Ltd., USA). Then the cor- dierites were purged with air and dried, followed by calcination at 550 Â°C for 3 h in air. Finally, the monolithic catalyst was obtained with a loading of about 160 g/L. The composition of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. 1.3 Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic activity measurements were carried out on a fixed bed quartz flow reactor. Reactant gases were regulated by mass flow controllers. The concentration of the simulated gases were: 0.1% NO, 0.1% NH 3 , 5% O 2 , balance Ar. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 10000 h ï€­1 and the total flow rate was 420 ml/min. The NO and NO 2 concentrations in the inlet and outlet gases were continually analyzed by a chemilumi- nescencent NO/NO x analyzer (Model 42i-HL, High Level, Thermo Electron Corporation). N 2 O concentration was de- tected by FT-IR (Antaris IGS, Nicolet). To avoid any influence caused by ammonia, the outlet stream was passed through an ammonia trap containing phosphoric acid solution before it was sent to the chemiluminescencent analyzer. The data were recorded after the reaction was stabilized for 0.5 h. NO x conversion and N 2 selectivity (S(N 2 )) were calculated as: NO x Conversion = ([NO x ] inlet ï€­ [NO x ] outlet )/ [NO x ] inlet Ã— 100% (1) S(N 2 ) = (1 ï€­ (2[N 2 O] outlet + [NO 2 ] outlet )/ ([NO x ] inlet +[NH 3 ] inlet )) Ã— 100% (2) A separate NO oxidation activity was measured when NH 3 was not supplied. The data was recorded after the reaction was stabilized for 0.5 h. The NO 2 ratio was obtained by NO 2 ratio = [NO 2 ] outlet /[NO x ] outlet Ã— 100% (3) In the above three equations, NO x represents NO and NO 2 . 1.4 Characterization of supports and catalysts 1.4.1 N 2 adsorption The surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the carriers and catalysts were measured with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method by N 2 adsorption at ï€­196 Â°C on a Quanachrome automated surface area and pore size analyzer (Autosorb SI). The samples were pretreated at 300 Â°C for 3 h prior to the measurement. 1.4.2 Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) Total oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was measured with a microreactor. Prior to measurement, the sample (200 mg) was treated at 500 Â°C under H 2 flow (40 ml/min) for 1 h and cooled to 200 Â°C under N 2 flow (20 ml/min). Then pulses of oxygen were injected until the breakthrough point. The OSC was evaluated by the oxygen consumption. The detector was a thermal conductivity detector. 1.4.3 X-ray diffraction Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were per- formed on a Japan Science D/max-rA diffractometer using Cu K ï�¡ (ï�¬ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The tube voltage and current were 40 kV and 100 mA, respectively. The XRD powder dif- fractogram was recorded at 0.03Âº/s intervals in the range of 20Âºâ€“80Âº. The crystalline phases were identified using reference data from the International Center Diffraction Data (ICDD).

XU Haidi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1927â€“1937 1.4.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained by a British Kratos XSAM-800 electron spectrometer using 13 kV high voltage and 20 mA electron current using Mg K ï�¡ radiation. The C 1s peak (284.8 eV) was used for the calibra- tion of the binding energy values. The pressure in the analyti- cal chamber was about 1 Ã— 10 âˆ’9 Pa. 1.4.5 Temperature programmed desorption with NH 3 /NO Temperature-programmed desorption experiments of NH 3 or NO (NH 3 /NO-TPD) were carried out on a fixed bed quartz reactor. A sample mass of 80 mg and a gas flow rate of 30 ml/min were used. The experiment included four stages: (1) degasification of the sample in Ar at 400 Â°C for 1 h, (2) ad- sorption of 2% NH 3 (or 2% NO) at 80 Â°C for 1 h, (3) isothermal desorption in Ar at 80 Â°C until no NH 3 (or NO) was detected, and (4) temperature programmed desorption in Ar (TPD stage) at 10 Â°C/min up to 500 Â°C. The detector was a thermal con- ductivity detector. 1.4.6 Temperature programmed reduction with H 2 Temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 (H 2 -TPR) ex- periments were carried out on a self-assembled experimental equipment with a thermal conductivity detector. All samples (100 mg) were pretreated in a quartz tubular microreactor in a flow of pure N 2 at 500 Â°C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The reduction was carried out in a flow of 5% H 2 -95% N 2 from room temperature to 750 Â°C with a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic performance test 2.1.1 Catalytic activity The activities of the MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts with different Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratios at GHSV=10000 h ï€­1 are shown in Fig. 1. The NO x conversion curves had a volcano shape, which showed that the NH 3 -SCR reaction has an activity temperature window. Combining Fig. 1 with Table 2 showed that the activity temperature window of ï�„T 90 (temperature range at which NO x conversion exceeded 90%) was shifted to lower temperature, and the light-off temperature T 50 (tem- perature at which NO x conversion was 50%) gradually de- creased with the increase of the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio until 0.5 (Cat-4). However the T 50 of Cat-5 with the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio of 0.6 rose to 128 ÂºC. The trend of T 90 (temperature at which NO x conversion was 90%) was in agreement with the trend of T 50 , which indicated that the total activity first in- creased and then decreased with increasing Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio with a maximum at 0.5. Moreover, Table 2 showed that the differences between T 90 and T 50 (ï�„T = T 90 â€“ T 50 ) of the four catalysts with Mn/(Mn+Ce) â‰¤ 0.5 were all about 70 ÂºC, which showed that these catalysts possess a similar temperature be- havior. However, the ï�„T of Cat-5 was 122 ÂºC. The results indicated that the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio played a key role in the catalytic performance, and it affected T 50 , T 90 , ï�„T 90 , ï�„T and maximum NO x conversion. In addition, Cat-4 exhibited high H 2 O and SO 2 tolerance, which was shown in our previous work [19]. So Cat-4 with the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5 has the best catalytic performance of the five catalysts. The comparison of the NO x conversion between the carrier and catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. The 10% WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier had some activity and gave 10% NO x conversion below 350 ÂºC, and the NO x conversion increased with temperature and reached 40% at 500 ÂºC. From Fig. 1, it can be clearly seen that the activity of the carrier was remarkably increased when 20% MnO x (Cat-6) and 20% CeO 2 (Cat-7) were impregnated onto the carrier, respectively. The T 50 of Cat-6 was 149 ÂºC. Cat-7 had the highest T 50 , which was 218 ÂºC, and it reached T 90 fastest while ï�„T was only 49 ÂºC. Comparing Cat-4 with Cat-6 and Cat-7, the low temperature performance of Cat-4 was better than the two catalysts with a single active component. From the above results, it can be concluded that MnO x and CeO 2 together as active components improved the low tem- 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 0 20 40 60 80 100 Temperature ( o C) N O x c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Cat-1 Cat-2 Cat-3 Cat-4 Cat-5 Cat-6 Cat-7 10% WO 3 -ZrO 2 Fig. 1.

N 2 selectivity often decreased with increased temperature for catalysts with manganese oxides [11]. In this work, the N 2 selectivity of Cat-4 also followed this rule, while the generated amount of N 2 O was considerably enhanced by increasing temperature. The results are shown Fig. 2. It can be seen that the N 2 selectivity of Cat-4 was over 90% below 375 ÂºC. 2.1.2 Oxidation of NO to NO 2 Figure 3 depicts the NO 2 ratio (the fraction of NO 2 in the total outlet concentration of NO x ) as a function of reaction temperature in the absence of NH 3 over Cat-1 to Cat-5 from NO partially oxidized to NO 2 in the presence of excess O 2 . The NO 2 ratio showed an increasing trend with the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio below 300 ÂºC, although the curve for each catalyst was different. At above 300 ÂºC, the NO 2 ratios for all catalysts rapidly increased with temperature and then these became small after reaching the peak value. Cat-4 had the largest rate of increase of NO 2 and the peak maximum was at 350 ÂºC at which NO x conversion reached 100%. The other catalysts had the peak maximum at 400 ÂºC. Qi et al. [11] suggested that NO can be more easily reduced to N 2 by NH 3 when there is some NO 2 than with NO alone because the overall reaction would be the â€œfast SCRâ€� reaction: 2NH 3 + NO + NO 2 â†’ 2N 2 + 3H 2 O when some NO was oxidized to NO 2 in the SCR reaction. There is only a little NO 2 generated by the NO oxidation reaction in Fig. 3, but the NO 2 formed can be continuously fed to the reducing agent NH 3 , and would block NH 3 oxidation reaction at high temperatures [20]. Therefore, Cat-4 had the highest oxidation rate of NO to NO 2 and the lowest oxidation temperature, which contributed to its excellent NH 3 -SCR activity. 2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 Textural properties of carrier and catalysts The textural properties of the carrier and catalysts are shown in Table 3. Compared with the carrier, the surface area and pore volume of catalysts were sharply decreased after the carrier was loaded with the active components. This may be because the active components filled or partially plugged the pores of the carrier. The surface area and pore volume showed an in- creasing trend with the Mn/(Mn+Ce) ratio. Cat-4 had the largest surface area and pore volume of 60.0 m 2 /g and 0.17 ml/g, respectively. These values started to decrease with the further increase of the value of Mn/(Mn+Ce). The pore di- ameters of the catalysts showed improvement after the intro- duction of active components. However, the pore diameters of the catalysts decreased with the increase of the ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce), except for Cat-4 that had the largest pore di- ameter of 11.3 nm. Cat-4 had the largest surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter, which helped the active compo- nents to disperse well on the carrier. Thereby, the active sites were increased, and the NH 3 -SCR reaction performance im- proved. At the same time, the larger pore volume and pore diameter helped the transport of reactants and products [21,22]. Therefore, the NH 3 -SCR performance of Cat-4 was improved. 2.2.2 OSC of carrier and catalysts As can be seen from Table 3, there was no OSC on the 10% WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier. The catalysts with different mass ratios of Mn/(Mn+Ce) had oxygen storage capacity.

Cat-4 with the largest sur- face area, pore volume, and pore diameter was conducive for high MnO x -CeO 2 dispersion on the carrier, which improved the circulation and transformation of active oxygen species on the catalyst and this resulted in the largest OSC value for Cat-4. A previous study [23] has shown that the NH 3 -SCR reaction mainly occurs by 4NH 3 + 4NO + O 2 â†’ 4N 2 + 6H 2 O (5). However, the reaction will proceed by the â€œfast SCRâ€� reaction: 2NH 3 + NO + NO 2 â†’ 2N 2 + 3H 2 O (4) when there is NO 2 in the reaction system. The rate of reaction (4) is faster than that of reaction (5). Therefore, the reaction rate would be increased if there is NO 2 generated in the reaction system. Although the NH 3 -SCR reaction is carried out in a rich oxygen environment, the proportion of generated NO x still cannot meet the re- quirement of accelerating the reaction in the system [24]. Ac- tive oxygen on the catalyst surface favors the oxidation of NO to NO 2 , which then promotes the NO x conversion of the cata- lyst [18]. Therefore, a catalyst with a larger OSC and more surface active oxygen can increase the NH 3 -SCR reaction. With respect to the textural properties and OSC results, the catalytic activities of the five catalysts were consistent with the characterization results. In particular, Cat-4 had a large OSC and the best NH 3 -SCR performance. 2.2.3 Structure of the catalyst XRD experiments were carried out in order to study the structural properties of the catalysts. The results are given in Fig. 4. All the catalysts were mainly present as the tetragonal ZrO 2 phase after calcination at 550 Â°C with XRD peaks at 30.3Â°, 35.3Â°, 50.5Â°, 60.2Â°, and 74.5Â°. The five catalysts with different mass ratios of Mn/(Mn+Ce) showed cubic Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 crystals that had peaks at 2Î¸ = 28.8Â°, 48.0Â°, and 57.0Â°. There was a small shift, which was negligible, in these three diffraction peaks with increasing Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio. However, the intensity of the peaks gradually decreased and the crystalline phase became blurred, which indicated that the crystallites of the Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 solid solution became smaller because of the decrease of CeO 2 loading. In addition, no MnO x phase was observed with the catalysts containing Mn, which may be due to the fact that Mn was well incorporated into the matrix of ZrO 2 [25] or that MnO x existed as an amor- phous phase or was highly dispersed [6,26]. For Cat-6, only one diffraction peak of the monoclinic ZrO 2 phase was ob- served at 28.4Âº. Moreover, there was no diffraction peak for MnO x , suggesting that MnO x mainly exists as an amorphous structure. For Cat-7, the diffractogram of CeO 2 showed three diffraction peaks of the cubic fluorite-like structure located at 28.5Â°, 47.4Â°, and 56.3Â°. Based on the above analysis, there was only one diffraction peak attributed to the monoclinic ZrO 2 phase when MnO x was the only one active component, and there were cubic fluorite-like CeO 2 phases with the three characteristic peaks when CeO 2 was the single active compo- nent. Therefore, the co-existence of MnO x and CeO 2 promoted the formation of the Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 solid solution. In order to further characterize the state of Zr, a peak shift of the XRD patterns in the 2Î¸ range of 29Â°ï€­32Â° for tetragonal ZrO 2 was examined. This is shown in Fig. 4(b). With increas- ing Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, the diffraction peak attributed to tetragonal ZrO 2 was shifted higher to 30.23Â° for Cat-2, 30.34Â° for Cat-3, 30.45Â° for Cat-4, and 30.34Â° for Cat-5. This is listed in Table 4. Cat-4 with Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5 has the highest 2Î¸ of the five catalysts, indicating that the structural matrix of ZrO 2 has been altered by Mn and some manganese species has en- tered the tetragonal lattice to generate the MnZrO x solid solu- tion [27]. Since the radius of Mn 4+ (0.060 nm) and Mn 3+ (0.066 nm) are smaller than those of Ce 4+ (0.092 nm) and Ce 3+ (0.103 nm), manganese cations more easily enter the ZrO 2 lattice (the radius of Zr 4+ is 0.079 nm) [25] than ceria cations, and the incorporation of manganese cations into tetragonal ZrO 2 led to the decrease of the lattice parameters [27]. The cell volume V cell of the different catalysts was calculated from the formula: V cell = a Ã— b Ã— c, in which, a, b, and c are the cell parameters. The values are listed in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, Cat-4 had the smallest V cell of 0.0656 nm 3 and the highest value of 2Î¸ of 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 29.0 29.5 30.0 30.5 31.0 31.5 32.0 Tetragonal ZrO 2 Monoclinic ZrO 2 Cubic CeO 2 Cubic Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 2ï�±/( o ) Cat-7 Cat-6 Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 I n t e n s i t y Cat-1 (a) Cat-7 Cat-6 Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 Cat-1 I n t e n s i t y 2ï�±/( o ) (b) Fig. 4. XRD diffraction patterns for the different catalysts. XU Haidi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1927â€“1937 30.45Â°, which was consistent with the above analysis. Com- bining with Table 3, we can also see that the textural properties are in good agreement with the structural properties. The order of the average particle size of zirconia for the different cata- lysts, calculated from the diffraction peak at 30.3Â° of the (101) crystal plane was opposite to that of their surface area (in Table 3), which means that Cat-4 had the smallest crystal and the largest surface area. On further increasing the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce), the additional Mn cannot be incorporated into the matrix of ZrO 2 and the additional manganese blocked the pore network of the WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier, which resulted in the decrease of 2Î¸, average particle size and surface area of tetragonal ZrO 2 and V cell increases, so that the dispersion of MnO x on the catalyst surface was reduced [26]. Therefore, it can be concluded that Mn incorporated into the matrix of ZrO 2 promoted the dispersion of MnO x on the catalyst surface, and the appropriate mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) helped the disper- sion of MnO x on the catalysts, which plays a significant role in reducing NO x to N 2 . 2.2.4 XPS analysis To investigate the influence of different Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio on the surface electronic properties, the five catalysts were characterized by XPS. The XPS results of the Ce 3d peak for the catalysts are presented in Fig. 5(a). The Ce 3d 3/2 and Ce 3d 5/2 states contribution were denoted by â€œuâ€� and â€œvâ€�, respec- tively. The labels u, u2, and u3 showed the photoelectron peaks of Ce 4+ 3d 3/2 and v, v2, and v3 showed the photoelectron peaks of Ce 4+ 3d 5/2 [28]. The other two peaks, u1 and v1, were at- tributed to Ce 3+ 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 . According to the XPS patterns in Fig. 5(a), the characteristic peaks of Ce 4+ (u3 and v) were stronger than those of Ce 3+ (u1 and v1), which showed that the dominating valance state of Ce was Ce 4+ for the five catalysts, and Ce 3+ as the secondary valance state played a key role in creating charge imbalance, vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalyst surface [29]. The binding energies (BE) of the characteristic peaks of Ce 4+ 3d 5/2 (v) and Ce 3+ 3d 5/2 (v1) are listed in Table 5. With the increase of the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, there was a little difference that was within the error range for the BE value (about 822.5 eV) of Ce 4+ 3d 5/2 of all catalysts except for Cat-1, which was located at 822.9 eV. This may be due to the fact that Cat-1 had the largest loading of CeO x (16 wt%) and has a strong interaction between Ce and the carrier [14]. For Ce 3+ 3d 5/2 (v1), there was an increasing trend of BE with increased Mn/(Mn+Ce), but the trend was not obvious. However, for Cat-4, the BE suddenly decreased about 1 to 885.7 eV when the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) reached 0.5, indicating that Cat-4 possessed the highest electron density for Ce 3+ 3d 5/2 among all the catalysts. This is beneficial because Ce 3+ can lose one electron to be oxidized to Ce 4+ , which im- proves the mobility of the active oxygen between Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ [14]. From Fig. 5(a), it can be seen that the total peak area of Ce 3d was reduced with increasing Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, which then suddenly increased at the mass Mn/(Mn+Ce) ratio of 0.5. This then decreased with a higher Mn/(Mn+Ce). This is in good agreement with the result of the surface atomic con- centration of Ce in the catalysts listed in Table 6. Cat-1 with the largest CeO 2 loading (16 wt%) had more surface atomic con- centration of Ce (3.2%), but the surface atomic concentration of Ce was abruptly increased to 4.0% for Cat-4. The relative content of Ce 3+ /Ce on the various catalyst surfaces was calcu- Table 4 Structural properties of tetragonal ZrO 2 Sample 2Î¸/ (Âº) a = b (nm) c (nm) V cell (nm 3 ) Zirconia particle size d ZrO2 (nm) Cat-1 30.31 0.3598 0.5137 0.0665 13.8 Cat-2 30.23 0.3605 0.5149 0.0669 13.4 Cat-3 30.34 0.3592 0.5142 0.0664 12.7 Cat-4 30.45 0.3600 0.5061 0.0656 11.7 Cat-5 30.34 0.3592 0.5136 0.0663 12.4 Cat-6 30.43 0.3590 0.5168 0.0666 12.7 Cat-7 30.32 0.3595 0.5127 0.0662 12.7 880 890 900 910 920 635 640 645 650 655 660 525.0 527.5 530.0 532.5 535.0 Ce 3+ Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 I n t e n s i t y Cat-1 v v1 v2 v3 u u1 u2 u3 Ce 4+ (a) Binding energy (eV) Binding energy (eV) Mn 2p 1/2 Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 Cat-1 Mn 2p 3/2 (b) Binding energy (eV) O sur O ads O latt Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 Cat-1 (c) Fig. 5.

This is listed in Table 5. The order of the value of Ce 3+ /Ce with the change of Mn/(Mn+Ce) was the same as that of the surface atomic concentration of Ce. A previous paper [30] reported that the increase of the Ce 3+ content enhanced lattice oxygen de- fects on the catalyst surface. In addition, more Ce 3+ /Ce can promote the oxidation of NO to NO 2 because of the charge imbalance, vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds on the catalyst surface [29,31]. It is generally regarded that the NH 3 -SCR reaction at low temperature would be considerably enhanced when some NO is oxidized to NO 2 to give the â€œfast SCRâ€� reaction: 2NH 3 + NO + NO 2 â†’ 2N 2 + 3H 2 O (4) [32]. Cat-4 has the most surface atomic concentration of Ce (4.0%) and the largest value of Ce 3+ /Ce (20.7%), which is one reason for its best catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5(b), Tables 5 and 6, the peak intensities and sharpening of the Mn 2p peak was remarkably increased with the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio until 0.5, so Cat-4 has the most surface atomic concentration of Mn. For all the catalysts, there were two peaks of Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 . The BE of Mn 2p 3/2 was located at 641.9 eV, except for Cat-1 at 641.7 eV and Cat-5 at 642.3 eV, suggesting that Mn 4+ was the mainly valance state of Mn in these catalysts [33]. It also can be seen that the largest surface atomic concentration of Ce and Mn promoted the synergism between Mn and Ce because Ce can provide oxygen to Mn to enhance the valence and oxidation ability of Mn [34], and consequently, the activity for the SCR reaction was improved. Figure 5(c) presents XPS measurement results of the O 1s core level of the oxygen species on the catalysts surface. The data are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. According to the lit- erature, there are two lattice oxygen peaks of O 1s at 528.9â€“530 eV, one adsorbed oxygen peak at 531.9 eV and one surface oxygen peaks at 533.5 eV in pure CeO 2 . For pure MnO x , the O 1s spectrum has only one peak at 529.8 eV attributed to lattice oxygen. The peak at 531.3 eV can be assigned to adsorbed species (H 2 O, CO 2 , surface OH species) and active oxygen, and the peak of surface oxygen from hydroxyl species and ad- sorbed water species is at 533.5 eV [27]. For all five catalysts, there were three peaks, denoted as O latt , O ads , and O sur . The three BEs of O 1s showed a small difference that was within the error range. On the MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts, there was a shift to higher values with increasing Mn/(Mn+Ce) ratio except for Cat-5 with the high Mn content. Simultaneously, the amount of lattice oxygen decreased with increasing Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass, while the amount of adsorbed oxygen increased. The XPS O 1s results are in agreement with the following TPR analysis, and would explain the increased in- tensity of the reduction peaks in H 2 -TPR (given in detail in the TPR analysis). The above observation is in agreement with Arenaâ€™s report that â€˜â€˜Mnâ†�Oâ€™â€™ electron transfer processes en- able the formation of very reactive electrophilic oxygen species (O 2 ï€­ , O 2 = , O ï€­ , OÂ·)â€� [35]. These very reactive electrophilic oxygen species are active oxygen species. Absorbed oxygen is the most active oxygen species, which plays an important role in the oxidation processes [36]. The active oxygen can be easily transferred by the oxygen in the gas phase or in the molecules adsorbed on the catalysts [37]; they can actively take part in oxidation and are responsible for the high catalytic activity of Cat-4. 2.2.5 NH 3 /NO-TPD analysis The NH 3 -TPD patterns of the five catalysts are presented in Fig. 6(a). In all the catalysts, two desorption peaks in the tem- perature range of 80â€“500 Â°C were observed. Qi et al. [17,18] have proposed that the Lewis acid sites are the main acid sites, rather than the BrÃ¶nsted acid sites, on pure MnO x , pure CeO 2 , and MnO x -CeO 2 mixed oxides. In the preceding report, the quantity of Lewis acid sites was about as the same as that of strong BrÃ¶nsted acid sites in WO 3 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides meas- ured by the co-precipitation method [38]. Thus, we assigned the TPD peaks as: the low temperature peaks were assigned to the desorption of bonds between NH 3 and Lewis acid sites or NH 4 + and the surface hydroxyls [32], and the other broader peak was attributed to the desorption of coordinated NH 3 bonded to BrÃ¶nsted acid sites of WO 3 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides [39]. As seen from Fig. 6(a), the two peak temperatures shifted to lower temperatures on increasing the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, suggesting that the relative strength of the acid sites became weaker. The two desorption peaks of Cat-4 were located at 195 and 271 Â°C, which were the lowest among the five catalysts. Both peaks were shifted to a lower temperature of more than 50 Â°C compared with Cat-1. The above shift of the desorption Table 5 Binding energies of the characteristic peaks for different ele- ments in the samples Binding energy (eV) Sample Ce 4+ 3d 5/2 Ce 3+ 3d 5/2 Mn 2p 3/2 O latt O ads O sur Cat-1 882.9 886.3 641.7 529.3 530.7 532.1 Cat-2 882.3 886.4 641.9 529.5 530.8 532.1 Cat-3 882.5 886.7 642.0 529.5 530.8 532.1 Cat-4 882.5 885.7 641.9 529.3 530.7 532.2 Cat-5 822.6 866.6 642.3 529.8 531.1 532.4 Table 6 Surface atomic concentration of different elements in the cata- lysts Surface atomic concentration (%) Sample Ce Ce 3+ /Ce Mn O O latt O ads O sur Cat-1 3.2 14.6 3.6 81.8 24.2 40.6 17.0 Cat-2 2.5 14.1 3.5 84.3 26.5 39.7 18.1 Cat-3 2.0 14.0 3. 8 86.7 19.0 41.6 26.1 Cat-4 4.0 20.7 3.8 84.3 20.2 43.9 20.2 Cat-5 2.4 14.5 2.9 86.7 22.6 46.7 17.4 XU Haidi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1927â€“1937 peak temperatures is in good agreement with the order of T 50 , indicating that Cat-4 possessed better low temperature catalytic activity, as reported by Chen et al. [40]. The NO-TPD patterns of the five catalysts are presented in Fig. 6(b). It can be seen that there were also two NO desorption peaks. Several FT-IR bands attributed to bidentate nitrate and the monodentate have been investigated in the adsorption of NO on MnO x -CeO 2 mixed oxides by Qi et al. [17]. Liu et al. [32] proposed that the desorption peaks of the bridging nitrate species and bidentate nitrate species were located at the high temperature from their NO x -TPD results. Thus, the two NO desorption peaks in Fig. 6(b) were attributed to the decompo- sition of a bidentate nitrate species with high thermal stability. With the increase of the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, the intensi- ties of the main NO desorption peaks became stronger and the temperature of NO desorption peak shifted to lower tempera- tures with the increase of the Mn/(Mn+Ce) ratio. Cat-4 had the strongest NO desorption intensity and the lowest NO desorp- tion temperature (277 and 366 Â°C) of the five catalysts. It has been demonstrated that the increase of MnO x benefits NO oxidation to NO 2 , which then increases the generation of nitrate species at lower temperatures [32]. According to this analysis, the lower NO desorption temperature and larger peak area over Cat-4 suggested that more nitrate species took part in NH 3 -SCR reaction. This was beneficial for promote NO x conversion. 2.2.6 H 2 -TPR results In order to investigate the influence of changing the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) on the redox properties of the catalysts, H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out. The results are given in Fig. 7. A main reduction peak with the maximum at 657 ÂºC was observed on the 10% WO 3 -ZrO 2 carrier, while pure ZrO 2 gave a sharp reduction peak at 673 ÂºC. This indicated that the H 2 -TPR of WO 3 -ZrO 2 has two reductive steps, which were associated with the reduction of Zr 4+ to Zr 3+ and W 6+ to W 0 . After supporting 20% MnO x on WO 3 -ZrO 2 (Cat-6), the reduc- tion temperature was shifted to low temperature and there were four reduction peaks: a shoulder peak at 350 ÂºC attributed to the reduction of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3 and surface absorbed oxygen species, a sharp peak at 480 ÂºC ascribed to the reduction of Mn 2 O 3 to Mn 3 O 4 , another shoulder peak at 510 Â°C assigned to the reduction of Mn 3 O 4 to MnO [41,42], and another sharp peak at 620 Â°C due to the reduction of both Zr 4+ to Zr 3+ and W 6+ to W 0 . Only two reduction peaks were observed after sup- porting 20% CeO 2 on WO 3 -ZrO 2 (Cat-7): the first at 546 Â°C can be considered as the reduction of reducible surface CeO 2 to Ce 2 O 3 and surface absorbed oxygen species [27] and the sec- ond at 624 Â°C was the reduction of both Zr 4+ to Zr 3+ and W 6+ to W 0 . Therefore, it can be concluded that there were several types of reduction peaks after manganese species and cerium 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Cat-1 Cat-2 Cat-3 Cat-4 Cat-5 I n t e n s i t y (a) Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 I n t e n s i t y Temperature ( o C) Cat-1 I n t e n s i t y Cat-1 Cat-2 Cat-3 Cat-4 Cat-5 (b) Temperature ( o C) Cat-5 Cat-4 Cat-3 Cat-2 I n t e n s i t y Cat-1 Fig. 6.

XU Haidi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1927â€“1937 species were together impregnated on WO 3 -ZrO 2 , which were ascribed to MnO 2 â†’ Mn 2 O 3 , Mn 2 O 3 â†’ Mn 3 O 4 , Mn 3 O 4 â†’ MnO, CeO 2 â†’ Ce 2 O 3 , Zr 4+ â†’ Zr 3+ , W 6+ â†’ W 0 , and surface absorbed oxygen species in the sequence from low temperature to high temperature. For Cat-1 with Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.2, the reduction peaks of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3 and the surface absorbed oxygen species were located at 304 ÂºC, the reduction peak of Mn 2 O 3 to Mn 3 O 4 was at 449 ÂºC, the reduction peak of Mn 3 O 4 to MnO was at 505 Â°C, the reduction peak of reducible surface CeO 2 to Ce 2 O 3 was at 553 ï‚°C, and the reduction peaks of both Zr 4+ to Zr 3+ and W 6+ to W 0 were at 633 ï‚°C. With the increase of the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio, the intensities of the reduction peaks became stronger and the reduction temperatures shifted to lower values, but the various reduction peaks were no longer resolved but became continuous one by one. At the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5, Cat-4 showed four peaks in the H 2 -TPR spectrum, the reduction peaks of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3 and surface absorbed oxygen species was shifted to 290 ï‚°C, which was the lowest reduction temperature for this, and this catalyst had the largest reduction peak of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3 among the five catalysts. In addition, the reduction peak of Mn 2 O 3 to Mn 3 O 4 was shifted to 440 ï‚°C and the reduction peaks of Mn 3 O 4 to MnO and CeO 2 to Ce 2 O 3 were merged into a sharp reduction peak at 469 ï‚°C, which indicated that the manganese species was the main reducible species in Cat-4 with 10% content of both MnO x and CeO 2 . The reduction peaks of both Zr 4+ to Zr 3+ and W 6+ to W 0 was shifted to 620 ï‚°C. The whole reduction range was shifted towards higher temperature when the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) exceeded 0.5, and the main reduction peaks of the manganese species became sharper and stronger. Cat-4 had the lowest reduction temperature and largest re- duction peak of MnO x , which illustrated that MnO x on Cat-4 was more changed than that on the other catalysts, and the lower reduction temperature showed the higher dispersion of MnO x [43]. The lower reduction temperature and sharper re- duction peak indicated a stronger redox ability of the catalyst [44], which was one of the main reasons why Cat-4 had better low temperature SCR activity than the other catalysts. Fur- thermore, Cat-4 had stronger OSC ability and more surface O ads concentration than the other catalysts, according to the results of OSC and the analysis of the O 1s XPS result, so there were more mobile active surface oxygen species, which increased the redox ability of Cat-4 and promoted its SCR activity. 3 Conclusions A 10% MnO x -10%CeO 2 /10%WO 3 -ZrO 2 monolith catalyst gave a higher activity than other catalysts with different Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratios for the SCR of NO with NH 3 in the presence of excess O 2 . Increasing the Mn/(Mn+Ce) mass ratio promoted the NO activity of MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 up to Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5. On further increasing the Mn/(Mn+Ce) value, the drop in low temperature SCR activity was caused by a poorer dispersion of MnO x on the carrier surface. The supe- rior SCR activity of MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 with the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) of 0.5 was because it has a higher oxidation activity and the lowest oxidation temperature of NO to NO 2 , better textural properties that promoted the dispersion of the active components, and a higher surface atomic concentration of Ce and Mn with a larger value of Ce 3+ /Ce that promoted the synergism between Mn and Ce. In addition, the more active oxygen adsorbed on the surface of catalysts was more easily moved, and the catalyst had lower NH 3 and NO desorption temperatures and more acid sites and nitrate species on the surface that participated in the NH 3 -SCR reaction. An excellent redox ability also contributed the better NH 3 -SCR performance of the MnO x -CeO 2 /WO 3 -ZrO 2 monolithic catalyst with the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) of 0.5.

Tel/Fax: +86-28-85418451 A series of monolith MnO x -CeO2/WO3-ZrO2 catalysts with different mass ratios of Mn/(Mn+Ce) were prepared and used for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with NH3 in the presence of excess O2. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, oxygen storage capacity, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NH3/NO temperature-programmed desorption, and H2 temperature-programmed reduction. The best catalyst had the mass ratio of Mn/(Mn+Ce) = 0.5. It gave 90% NO x conversion in the range of 173-355 °C at the gas hourly space velocity of 10000 h−1, and characterization results showed that a higher oxidation activity of NO to NO2, more surface Ce and Mn with a larger Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, lower NH3 and NO desorption temperatures, and excellent redox ability were together responsible for its best NH3-SCR performance. 摘要 制备了一系列不同 Mn/(Mn+Ce) 质量比的 MnO x -CeO2/WO3-ZrO2 整体式催化剂用于富氧条件下的 NH3 选择性催化还原 NO x (NH3-SCR), 并采用 N2 吸脱附、储氧量、X 射线衍射、X 光电子能谱、NH3/NO 程序升温脱附以及 H2 程序升温还原等手段对催化剂进行表征. 结果表明, 当 Mn/(Mn+Ce) 质量比为 0.5 时, 整体式催化剂具有较好的 NH3-SCR 性能, 在空速 10000 h−1 和 173–355 ºC 条件反应下, NO x 转化率达 90% 以上. 这是由于该 MnO x -CeO2/WO3-ZrO2 催化剂具有更高的 NO 氧化活性、更高的表面 Ce 和 Mn 原子浓度以及 Ce3+/Ce 值较低的 NH3 和 NO 脱附温度以及优异的氧化还原性能所致.
