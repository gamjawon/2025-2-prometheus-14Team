The coordination of dual-heteroatom is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of single-atom catalysts. Here, we synthesize Mn-SG-500 with isolated Mn sites coordinated with two sulfur and two oxygen atoms on graphene, and perform in-depth research on the structure-activity relationship for the OER. Under alkaline conditions, the Mn-SG-500 displays higher OER activity than commercial RuO2. Combining in-situ structure analysis and theoretical calculations, we identify Mn-S2O2 as the catalytic active center, on which the oxidation of *O to *OOH is the rate-control step. The improved OER activity is attributed to the redistribution and optimization of Mn charges caused by the co-coordination of S and O. This work is helpful for further structure design and performance management of single-atom catalysts with dual-heteroatom doping. Graphical Abstract Through oxygen and sulfur dual-heteroatom doping, the OER activity of isolated Mn sites is significantly improved, on which the Mn-S2O2G structure exhibits lower OER energy barrier. Keywords Dual-heteroatom ligand In-situ Raman Oxygen evolution reaction Single atom catalyst Theoretical calculation 1 Introduction Developing and utilizing renewable energy (such as wind energy and solar energy) can mitigate the depletion of traditional fossil fuels [1,2]. However, due to geographical and weather restrictions, the storage and transformation of renewable energy break through various restrictions to increase the accessibility of energy utilization, which is the main direction of energy development at present [3,4]. OER is an important half-reaction of electrolytic water and rechargeable zinc-air battery, which has a high reaction barrier and a large overpotential, greatly limiting the performance improvement of energy storage systems [5,6]. Therefore, a great deal of research has been focused on developing efficient and stable OER catalysts. Single atom catalysts (SACs) are cutting-edge heterogeneous materials, in which the metal atom is the catalytic active center and has a high atomic utilization [7–10]. Due to large specific surface area, strong metal-carrier interaction, and high electrical conductivity, graphene materials show obvious advantages in SAC carriers [11–13]. Ir and Ru oxides have been widely studied and used in electrocatalytic OER, but their large-scale production has been limited by high cost [14–16]. To comply with sustainable development and reduce costs, transition metals, namely iron [17,18], cobalt [19,20], and nickel [21] have been loaded onto graphene carriers for OER [22,23]. As a natural OER active center, the excitation of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Mn atoms to the maximum extent has received extensive attention [24]. Metal atoms in carbon-support SACs used in electrochemical fields such as electrocatalysis and energy storage are typically connected in the form of M–N, as stronger metal-support interaction to ensure that metal atoms do not overflow [25]. Guan et al. [26] anchored manganese atoms on graphene to make the Mn sites exhibit excellent OER activity by combining with four nitrogen atoms. Nevertheless, in addition to structural stability, it is essential to regulate the d-orbital electrons of the central metal atom to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst. It has been shown that the adsorption of intermediates on M-N4 structure is not optimal due to the strong electron donating effect of nitrogen [27]. Changing the type and number of coordination atoms is an effective strategy to modulate the crystal field of single atomic sites, adjust the d-electron structure and spin state of the metal, and optimize the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. Li et al. [28] substituted two nitrogen atoms in Mn-N4 with two carbon atoms to regulate the adsorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst and reduce OER overpotential. Zeng et al. [29] introduced boron dopants into Mn-N4, which reduced the d-orbital charge density of Mn, reduced the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on Mn, and improved the electrocatalytic activity. Yao et al. [30] found that pre-adsorbed oxygen atoms at the Ru-N4 site further optimized the adsorption and desorption of active intermediates, improving the OER activity. Hence, the introduction of dual-heteroatoms has a positive effect on the activity of single atom sites [31]. Compared with nitrogen atom, the introduction of S has a stronger conductivity enhancement effect on graphene, effectively promoting the reduction of graphene oxide. The oxygen atoms on graphene are conducive to improving surface hydrophilicity and enhancing mass transfer efficiency, especially for water-based electrolytes. However, the enhancement of OER activity by dual-heteroatom on single atom electrocatalyst has been simply attributed to the coordination effect [32]. The electronic effect should be more deeply understood, which is beneficial to better understanding the electrocatalysis mechanism. To analysis the electronic effect caused by dual-heteroatoms, we designed isolated Mn sites coordinated with sulfur and oxygen on graphene to study the OER activity. Under alkaline conditions, Mn-SG-500 (Mn-O/S loaded on graphene) exhibited an overpotential of 332 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1, indicating enhanced OER activity compared to related materials such as Mn-G-500 (Mn-O/C loaded on graphene). In addition, the valence of Mn increased during the OER, and the Mn(IV) was the active center as analyzed by in-situ Raman and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Theoretical calculations showed that Mn-S2O2G demonstrated the best stability and the lowest theoretical overpotential, on which the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of *O to *OOH. The electron donating effect of oxygen and sulfur significantly increases the charge density around Mn. The electronic regulation strategy of double nonmetallic doping could be extended to the design of other transition metal SACs. For example, introducing sulfur into Fe-N-C was conducive to the generation of low-spin Fe3+ and promoted OH* desorption process [33]. Isolated Ni atom with three nitrogen and one sulfur coordination reduced the OER barrier by redistributing the charge [34]. The bonding of cobalt sites with oxygen intermediates was weakened due to the co-coordination of nitrogen and phosphorus [35]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of catalysts Graphene oxide was synthesized according to the method described in the literature [36]. Mn-SG-500 was synthesized by freeze-drying and high-temperature calcination. Firstly, 1.8 mg MnCl2·4H2O and 100 mg of GO were dispersed into 50 mL of deionized water, and stirred ultrasonically for 30 min to form a uniformly dispersed colloidal solution, which was then freeze-dried to obtain solid A. After grinding the solid A and sulfur powder evenly, it was calcined in a tube furnace at 500 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (the heating rate is 10 °C min−1), and a black powder, namely Mn-SG-500, is obtained. The catalysts Mn-SG-T (T = 400, 600, and 700) were obtained at annealing temperature of 400, 600, 700 °C respectively. Mn-G-500 was obtained by direct high-temperature calcination of solid A in a tubular furnace without the addition of sulfur powder. In order to ensure the experimental contrast, SG and G are also synthesized by lyophilization and calcined two-step. Graphene oxide and sulfur powder were evenly ground and calcined in a tube furnace at 500 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain SG-500. G-500 was obtained by direct high-temperature calcination of graphene oxide without the addition of sulfur powder. 2.2 Material characterizations Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was performed on a Hitachi HT7700. High angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging was conducted with an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM 200F microscope. Energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis and corresponding elemental mapping were performed using the FEI TEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000. XPS spectra were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250. X-ray absorption structure (XAS) of Mn K-edge was conducted at BL14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Raman spectra were performed on a confocal microscopic Raman spectrometer (HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution). 2.3 Electrochemical measurement The OER test was performed on a workstation (CHI 760E) using a three-electrode system in 1 mol L−1 KOH. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve is recorded with 95% iR-compensation at a scan speed of 5 mV s−1. The Tafel slope is obtained by plotting the LSV curve using the equation η = a + b log j, where η refers to overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and a is the intercept. The applied potential was converted to a reversed hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by equation: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 1.0684. The activation energy (E a) is calculated by Arrhenius formula: . The LSV curves of the catalyst at different temperatures were obtained without IR compensation, and then the temperature and the current at the overpotential of 300 mV were mapped as 1/T(K−1)–log[I(A)] to obtain E a. 2.4 Computational methods Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) was used for the density functional theory (DFT) calculations [37,38]. The exchange-correlation functional was performed by using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential. The Brillouin zone consists of 1 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack point mesh. In this work, the Brönsted's model was used to explore the OER mechanism. The models are generally reported to proceed based on the following four steps: (1) H2O + * → *OH + H+ + e − (2) *OH → *O + H+ + e − (3) *O + H2O → *OOH + H+ + e − (4) *OOH → O2 + H+ + * + e − The Gibbs free energies of *OH, *O and *OOH on the surface of the modified electrode was evaluated using DFT calculations. The Gibbs free energy changes were calculated at the standard conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization The synthesis process of Mn-SG-500 is shown in Fig. 1(a) . In simple terms, Mn2+ ions were uniformly anchored onto the surface of the graphene oxide by abundant oxygen-containing functional groups to get precursor (Mn2+-G). Then the Mn-SG was obtained by mixing Mn2+-G with sulfur powder and annealing under nitrogen at 500 °C. TEM image shows that the synthesized Mn-SG possesses two-dimensional nanosheet structure and no metal-based nanoparticles are observed on the nanosheet (Fig. 1(b)). In addition, HAADF-STEM image with atomic resolution shows uniformly dispersed bright spots, representing that manganese was loaded on graphene in the form of isolated single atom (Fig. 1(c)). The content of manganese and sulfur in Mn-SG-500 was 1.1 wt% and 5.2 wt%, respectively, as detected by element analysis. From the XRD pattern, the peaks located at 25° and 45° belong to the (002) and (101) planes of graphene, and the doping of sulfur and manganese introduces defects, which significantly weaken the peak intensity (Fig. S1). In addition, no peaks of manganese-based nanoparticles appear in the XRD pattern, indicating that no manganese aggregates exist. In addition, the EDS confirms uniform dispersion of Mn, S and O (Figs. 1(d) and (e)). The chemical environment of Mn in Mn-SG was analyzed by XAS. As shown in Fig. 2(a) , the Mn-SG has Mn-K edge regions between MnO and Mn2O3, but closer to MnO, displaying that the valence of Mn in Mn-SG is close to +2. The EXAFS spectra (Fig. 2(b)) show the absence of Mn-Mn in Mn-SG, further verifying isolated single-atom Mn distribution. According to the best fitting results, the Mn–S distance is 2.34 ± 0.07 Å and the coordination number is 1.7 ± 0.4, and the Mn–O distance is 1.94 ± 0.05 Å and the coordination number is 1.8 ± 0.4 (Fig. 2(c)). The bond of Mn–S is longer than that of Mn–O bond, which is due to the strong interaction of Mn–O coordination caused by the large electronegativity of O. Fig. 2(d) shows the difference in charge density obtained from S and O by calculating simulated Mn atom, where yellow and green represent the accumulation and depletion of charge, respectively. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance The OER performance of Mn-SG was studied in a three-electrode system in 1 mol L−1 KOH. Fig. 3(a) shows the LSV curves of the Mn-SG-500, Mn-G-500, SG-500, G-500, and commercial RuO2. The results display that when the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Mn-SG-500 is 332 mV, which is smaller than Mn-G-500 (391 mV), SG-500 (403 mV), and G-500 (422 mV), and even better than RuO2 (353 mV). Further, the Tafel slope was calculated to study the kinetics of the catalyst during OER process. The results show that the Mn-SG-500 has the smallest Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1, which is smaller than Mn-G-500 (85 mV dec−1), SG-500 (92 mV dec−1), G-500 (112 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (68 mV dec−1), indicating that Mn-SG-500 has the fastest OER kinetics (Fig. 3(b)). Besides, in the range of non-Faraday current, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the catalyst at different scanning rates were measured to calculate the double layer capacitance (C dl) and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (Figs. S2–S5). The Mn-SG-500 has more opportunities to expose available active sites during electrocatalysis due to the large ECSA (269 cm−2), far exceeding that of other catalysts. Due to the large radius of sulfur, the introduction of sulfur to GO is difficult, and the doping process is inevitably accompanied by oxygen atoms, which are inherited from GO. Therefore, in the case of excessive sulfur components, the incorporation of sulfur can be controlled by changing the doping temperature. In order to select the optimum doping content of sulfur, a series of Mn-SG-T catalysts were synthesized (T = 400, 600, and 700) (Fig. S6). The Mn-SG-500 has a larger ECSA than Mn-SG-400 (85 cm2), Mn-SG-600 (232 cm2) and Mn-SG-700 (184 cm2) (Figs. S7–S9). In addition, the activation energy (E a) of the synthesized catalyst was calculated according to Arrhenius formula. With the increase of reaction temperature from 25 to 55 °C, the reaction activity of the catalyst increases (Fig. S10). The E a of Mn-SG-500 was calculated to be 32.6 ± 2.8 kJ mol−1, which is smaller than Mn-G-500 (37.1 ± 1.5 kJ mol−1), SG-500 (42.3 ± 0.38 kJ mol−1) and G-500 (45.9 ± 3.2 kJ mol−1), indicating that the combined action of Mn and S species accelerates the OER process (Fig. 3(c)). The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) diagram shows that when the OER process occurs, the valence of manganese species has changed from +2 to +4, and the tetravalent manganese species is the active substance of OER, which can be obtained by applying high voltage (Fig. 3(d)). Additionally, the addition of sulfur reduces the activation potential of Mn from 1.39 to 1.348 V and promotes OER. Moreover, the coordination of Mn and S has an obvious effect on the reduction of charge transfer resistance (R Mn-SG-500 = 10.9 Ω cm−2), which is conducive to the rapid transfer of charge (Fig. 3(e)). The stability of Mn-SG-500 was measured by chronoamperometry test at 1.6 V. Notably, the current density does not decrease and remains above 10 mA cm−2 after 25 h, indicating the excellent electrocatalytic stability of the Mn-SG-500 (Fig. 3(f)). Besides, the structure of Mn-SG-500 after OER has been characterized by XRD, Raman and XPS. The XRD pattern shows that there is no formation of manganese-based nanoparticles after OER (Fig. S11). The carbon structure of Mn-SG-500 after OER was studied by in-situ Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S12). For the initial Mn-SG-500, the sp 3 carbon (D band) and sp 2 carbon (G band) peak is centered at 1339 and 1586 cm−1, respectively, and the peaking area ratio was 1.31. As the applied voltage increased from 0.2 to 0.55 V, the I D/I G ratio gradually increases, indicating that the number of active edges and defect sites of the catalyst graphene layer increases under high potential. To further understand the valence state change of Mn sites, the Mn-SG-500 under different voltage conditions was collected for XPS characterization (Fig. S13, and Fig. 4 ). For the fresh Mn-SG-500, the Mn 2p spectrum includes three peaks at 640.6, 653.3, and 644.4 eV, characteristic of Mn2+ (Fig. 4(a)). With the increase of applied voltage, a new peak corresponding to Mn4+ appears at 641.9 eV, indicating that Mn2+ was oxidized to higher valence state during the reaction. Besides, in the fresh Mn-SG-500, the peak intensity of the S 2p spectrum at 167.7 eV (C-SO x -C) is much smaller than that at 164 eV, indicating that the sulfur in the fresh catalyst exists more in the form of –2 valence state rather than sulfur oxide (Fig. 4(b)) [39]. In addition, the peak at near 164 eV can be deconvolved into two different chemical environments, S–Mn (162.9 eV) and S–C (163.7 eV) [40–42]. In the O 2s spectrum, the fresh Mn-SG-500 has three different types of oxygen chemical bonds at the binding energy of 530.2, 531.6, and 532.9 eV, corresponding to O–Mn, O=C, and O–C bond, respectively (Fig. 4(c)) [43]. During the OER process, a new peak is observed at around 534.9 eV due to H–O–H bond, which is attributed to catalyst affinity for H2O or O2. With the increase of reaction voltage, the relative contents of Mn–S and Mn–O do not decrease, indicating that the catalyst has structural stability in the OER process. 3.3 OER mechanism analysis To elucidate the OER mechanism of the four-electron reaction and the electrocatalytic activity of Mn-S x O y G, we conducted corresponding theoretical calculations using DFT. A considerable number of potential models including Mn-S4G, Mn-S3OG, Mn-S2O2G, Mn-SO3G, Mn-S3G, Mn-O3G and Mn-O4G were meticulously constructed. Based on the calculations of formation energy, the Mn-SO3G model exhibits the lowest formation energy values, indicating that it is the most stable structure among the considered models. To assess the catalytic activities of different electrocatalysts, we calculated the theoretical overpotential (η) for the catalytically active sites in each model. In the case of the O–S model, the S and C atoms adjacent to the O atom, known as electron donors, exhibit high potential barriers for the rate-limiting step in the OER. To delve deeper into the catalytic mechanism, the population distributions of the relevant doped graphene materials are illustrated in Figs. 5(a)–(h) . Fig. 5(i) illustrates a notable disparity in the theoretical overpotential values on these five models, in with Mn-S2O2G displays a significantly lower value of 2.2 eV compared to Mn-S3OG and Mn-S3G in the *O-*OOH reaction step. This difference in overpotential can be attributed to the symmetrical structure of Mn-S2O2G. Consequently, the determination of the overpotential for Mn-S4G and Mn-SO3G shifts to the Mn–O bond rupture step, rather than the oxidation of *O to *OOH observed in Mn-S2O2G. It is disappointing that Mn-S4G, Mn-SO3G, Mn-O3G and Mn-O4G all exhibit higher overpotential values than Mn-S2O2G due to the strong binding of *OOH on the surfaces. Fig. 5(j) showcases an elegant volcano plot that portrays various active sites on different models. The OER overpotential values have been meticulously calculated, yielding remarkable results: 1.03 V for the Mn-S4G model, 1.17 V for Mn-S3OG, 0.96 V for Mn-S2O2G, 1.48 V for Mn-SO3G, 1.24 V for Mn-S3G, 1.20 V for Mn-O3G and 1.21 V for Mn-O4G. Significantly, the Mn-S2O2G model emerges as the clear victor with the lowest overpotential value. This implies a substantial decrease in the potential barrier of the third step, unequivocally highlighting the outstanding catalytic process of Mn-S2O2-doped graphene compared to its counterparts. Furthermore, based on our meticulous DFT calculations (Fig. 5(k)), an intriguing band alignment emerges. The enlightening results derived from the projected density of states (DOS) analysis uncover a noteworthy characteristic of the Mn-S2O2G, showcasing an exquisite alignment of the conduction and valence bands. This exceptional feature sets the stage for an effortless transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, thereby propelling the catalytic reaction process with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of the charge density in Mn-S2O2G model. Remarkably, Fig. 5(l) showcases the significant amplification of electron density surrounding the active Mn site. This augmentation can be attributed to the exceptional bonding electron coupling effect facilitated by the distinctive structural characteristics of single-atom metal-sulfur-oxygen doping. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Mn-based SAC with oxygen and sulfur dual-heteroatom coordination on graphene. The Mn-SG-500 displays higher OER activity than commercial RuO2, and its overpotential (η 10) is reduced by 59 mV compared with the sulfur-free sample Mn-G-500. According to the XAS, in-situ characterization and theoretical calculations, Mn-SG-500 has the optimal active configuration of sulfur and oxygen dual-heteroatom coordination Mn-S2O2. Mn4+ is a key species for the OER and the rate-control step is the oxidation of *O to *OOH. The analysis of OER performance of Mn SACs with O/S-dual-coordination environment encourages the study of the optimal electronic structure of other transition metal-based catalysts, promoting the development of advanced OER catalysts for energy storage and conversion.

        "dc:description": "The coordination of dual-heteroatom is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of single-atom catalysts. Here, we synthesize Mn-SG-500 with isolated Mn sites coordinated with two sulfur and two oxygen atoms on graphene, and perform in-depth research on the structure-activity relationship for the OER. Under alkaline conditions, the Mn-SG-500 displays higher OER activity than commercial RuO2. Combining in-situ structure analysis and theoretical calculations, we identify Mn-S2O2 as the catalytic active center, on which the oxidation of *O to *OOH is the rate-control step. The improved OER activity is attributed to the redistribution and optimization of Mn charges caused by the co-coordination of S and O. This work is helpful for further structure design and performance management of single-atom catalysts with dual-heteroatom doping.",
