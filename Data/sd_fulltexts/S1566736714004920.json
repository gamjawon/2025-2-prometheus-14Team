TiO2/SnO2 double-shelled hollow spheres are successfully synthesized by two-step liquid-phase deposition method using carbon sphere templates. The formation process of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres is discussed. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The behavior of photogenerated charges in the TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction structures has been investigated through surface photovoltage spectroscopy. The TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres which are realized show significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities, with respect to the cases of SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres. Furthermore, TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres show good recyclable photocatalytic activities. Keywords Hollow spheres Liquid-phase deposition Photocatalysis SnO2 TiO2 1 Introduction Environmental problems, such as organic pollutants and toxic water pollutants, provide the impetus for fundamental and applied research in the environmental area. Semiconductor photocatalysts exhibit several properties that are strongly sensitive to their structures, and are considered to be important materials for environmental applications [1–4]. However, the relatively low quantum yield that is normally caused due to rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes hinders the commercialization of this technology [5]. In order to enhance the quantum yield, the application of heterojunction oxide structures, such as ZnO/SnO2 [6,7], TiO2/SnO2 [8,9], and WO3/TiO2 [10,11], have been further introduced because the heterojunction could provide a potential driving force (the internal electrostatic potential in the space charge region) to reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Among these semiconductor oxides, TiO2 and SnO2, well-known wide direct band gap n-type semiconductors, are considered as the most promising functional materials due to their unique physical and chemical properties [12,13]. In the past decade, more and more TiO2/SnO2 nanomaterials have been reported to improve photocatalytic efficiency, because these nanomaterials possess heterojunction structure and a high surface area, which can provide both effective driving force and convenient way for photogenerated carriers to transfer to the reaction surfaces. For example, TiO2/SnO2 composite nanoparticles had been fabricated by one-step flame to get improved photocatalytic activity [14]. Efficient bicomponent TiO2/SnO2 nanofiber photocatalysts were prepared by electrospinning method [15,16]. Sieve-like SnO2/TiO2 nanotubes also showed enhanced photocatalytic efficiency, which had been fabricated by assembling sieve-like macroporous Sb-doped SnO2 film on vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes through a block copolymer soft-template method [17]. However, there are few studies on TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres as efficient and low-cost photocatalysts. In this paper, we report the SnO2/TiO2 double-shelled hollow spheres synthesized by a two-step liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method using carbon spheres as the templates for the first time. The SnO2/TiO2 hollow spheres, which have been achieved, show highly efficient photocatalytic activities for the decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB). 2 Experimental 2.1 Fabrication of SnO2/TiO2 hollow spheres Carbon spheres were prepared by the hydrothermal method according to a reported procedure [18]. In a typical procedure, 4g of glucose was dissolved in 30mL of deionized water, and then the resulting solution was transferred to a 50mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180°C for 20h. The products were centrifuged and rinsed for several times with distilled water and finally dried at 80°C for 12h. For the preparation of SnO2 shell, 0.3g of carbon spheres was dispersed and immersed in the aqueous solution of SnF2 (0.02M) under stirring at 50°C for 8h. The products were centrifuged and dried at 80°C for 12h. For the fabrication of TiO2 shell, carbon spheres with SnO2 shell are dispersed and immersed in the aqueous solution of ammonium hexafluorotitanate (0.05M) and boric acid (0.15M) under stirring at 50°C for 40min. The resulting products were dried at 80°C for 12h, followed by calcination at 550°C for 4h in air. TiO2/SnO2 double-shelled hollow spheres were finally obtained. For comparison, SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres are also fabricated with the same process to obtain the SnO2 shell and TiO2 shell, respectively. 2.2 Characterization The structure and morphologies of the samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The element signatures of the samples were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The UV–vis transmission optical properties were texted by UV-3150 double-beam. The specific surface area was determined by using the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The separation characteristics of photogenerated charge carriers were tested by a lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system. 2.3 Photocatalytic evaluation The photocatalytic activities of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres were investigated by measuring the photodegradation rate of RhB aqueous solution. The reaction suspension was prepared by adding the sample (10mg) into a 10mL of RhB (10mgL−1) solution. The suspension was stirred in the dark for 1h to ensure an adsorption/desorption equilibrium prior to UV irradiation. The suspension was then irradiated by an Hg lamp (500W) under continuous stirring. The remaining amounts of RhB in solution were determined by measuring the absorption intensity of the main peak at 554nm by UV–vis spectrophotometer (KD723PC). 3 Result and discussion The crystallinity of composite hollow spheres was examined by powder XRD measurements (Fig. S1). It can be seen that there are two sets of diffraction peaks. One set of diffraction peaks is indexed to the rutile SnO2 phases (JCPDS file.03-1114). The other set of peaks is connected to the anatase TiO2 phases (JCPDS file.02-387). No characteristic peaks for impurity were observed, which further confirmed the composition of SnO2 and TiO2 in the heterostructure. Fig. 1a shows the typical SEM image of carbon spheres. The average diameter is about 460–520nm. From Fig. 1b, it can be seen that the hollow spheres have average diameters of ~550–700nm and some spheres show open features with two shells, indicating that TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres have been fabricated successfully. Fig. 1c shows the chemical analysis of the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres by EDX analysis. From the EDX result, it can be observed that the dominant elements in the hollow spheres are stannum, titanium, and oxygen. A more detailed view of the morphology and microstructure of hollow spheres has been obtained by means of TEM. TEM images of the spheres clearly depict the remarkable contrast between the peripheral and internal parts (Fig. 1d). It is evident the hollow spheres are formed with two shells. Close examination shows that the inner shell (SnO2) has a thickness of ~30–35nm and outer shell (TiO2) has a thickness of ~60–70nm. Fig. 1e and f shows HRTEM images of SnO2 and TiO2 shells respectively. The clear and aligned lattice fringes, with a mean interplanar spacing of about 0.33nm (Fig. 1e), correspond to the (110) plane of tetragonal SnO2. The distance between the adjacent lattice fringes corresponds to the interplanar distance of the tetragonal TiO2 (101), which is d (101)=0.35nm (Fig. 1f). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the calcined TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) have been plotted in Fig. S2. The isotherm exhibits a type IV with type H4 hysteresis loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous solid materials [19,20]. As revealed from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution (the inset of Fig. S2), the average mesopore size is about 3.5nm and pore volume is about 0.2cm3/g. The BJH analysis indicates that the overall BET surface area of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres is 46.1m2/g. The above results show that we have successfully prepared TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres using a simple two-step LPD approach. Fig. 2 illustrates schematically the steps for the formation of the hollow spheres. The process starts with growing carbon spheres by a hydrothermal method. This is followed by the deposition of SnO2 on the carbon spheres. The reaction is summarized as the following [21]: (1) S n F 2 + H 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 ↔ S n O 2 + 2 H + + 2 F − . In the first step of synthesis system, the SnO2 is formed on the carbon spheres by a hydrolysis of SnF2. For the formation of TiO2 shell, the reactions are described as the following [22,23]: (2) T i F 6 2 − + 2 H 2 O ↔ T i O 2 + 4 H F + 2 F − (3) H 3 BO 3 + 4 H F ↔ B F 4 − + 3 H 2 O + H + . In the synthesis system, the TiO2 is formed by hydrolysis of Ti-fluoro complex ions as in Eq. (2). As shown in Eq. (3), the added boric acid acts as a scavenger for F−. Lastly, the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres can be obtained by wiping off carbon spheres during the process of calcination. The UV–visible absorption spectrum of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres is shown in Fig. 3a. For comparison, the absorption spectrum of SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres are also presented. In the direct transition semiconductor, the optical absorption coefficient (α) and the band gap energy (Eg) are related by αhv =D(hv −Eg)1/2, where h is the Planck's constant, v is the frequency of the incident photon, Eg is the optical band gap and D is constant. The variations of (αhv)2 versus the photon energy hv in the fundamental absorption region are plotted in the inset of Fig. 3a. The Eg values of the SnO2, TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres are 3.59, 3.36 and 3.45eV, respectively, by extrapolating the linear portion to the photon energy axis. This experimental result shows that the presence of TiO2 in the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres contributed to a red shift of the absorption edge compared with the SnO2 hollow spheres. It is evident that the formation of TiO2/SnO2 heterojunctions modified the electronic structures of the pristine semiconductors. The results of surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) of the samples are shown in Fig. 3b. SPS presents the SPV amplitude as a function of the incident wavelength. SPS is a well-established contactless and nondestructive technique for semiconductor characterization that relies on analyzing illumination-induced changes in the surface voltage. It is an effective tool for the investigation of the photoinduced charge-transfer properties in TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres and may provide useful information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of the sample. From Fig. 3b, it can be seen that an apparent SPV response ranging from 300 to 390nm is observed for TiO2/SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres, whereas a quite weak SPV response is observed for SnO2 hollow spheres. Compared with the TiO2 hollow spheres, TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres show a distinctly stronger SPV response, indicating that the photogenerated charges are more effectively separated for the latter material. RhB, a chemically stable and poorly biodegradable dye contaminant in wastewater, is used to evaluate the photocatalytic ability of the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres. Fig. 4a shows the temporal absorption spectral changes of RhB in photo-degradation over the TiO2/SnO2 hollow sphere catalysts under UV-light irradiation. The result indicated that the absorption peak at 554nm disappeared after irradiation for 15min. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres is plotted in Fig. 4b, evaluated by the degradation examination of RhB solution under UV-light illumination. For comparison, the photocatalytic experiments were further carried out with the SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres. After 15min illumination, the degradation of RhB in a direct photolysis process without any photocatalyst is negligible. The degradation efficiency of RhB by a photocatalytic process was 100% when TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres existed. 80% and 9% of RhB were photocatalytic degraded when using TiO2 and SnO2 hollow spheres, respectively, under the same conditions. It is obvious that the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity. The stability of the TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction photocatalyst was also demonstrated by the recycling test (Fig. 4c). After four cycles of photocatalytic degradation, no significant loss of activity was represented. Based on the above photocatalytic results, it is demonstrated that the improved photocatalytic ability of the TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction photocatalyst could be attributed to the enhanced quantum yield promoted by the heterojunction, which was consistent with the observation in the SPV measurements. Additionally, the composite hollow spheres with high surface areas were in favor of the transfer of electrons and holes generated inside the crystal to the surface, and facilitated the degradation of RhB. The charge separation mechanism of TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres is shown in Fig. 4d. The whole process consists of the formation of charge carriers, the dissociation of charge carriers into free carriers, the transfer of free carriers to the surface, and the generation of active oxygen species such as OH or O2 −. Under UV luminescence, the photogenerated carriers of electrons and holes appear in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) for each semiconductor, respectively. As we know, the CB edges of SnO2 and anatase TiO2 are situated at +0.07 and −0.34V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH7, respectively. The VB edge of SnO2 (+3.66V) is more positive than that of anatase TiO2 (+3.02V) [8,24,25]. Under the potential driving force of TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction, the electrons (holes) transfer from the CB of TiO2 (VB of SnO2) to the CB of SnO2 (VB of TiO2). Due to the presence of a TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction, the probability of the recombination of electron-hole pairs is significantly reduced. Consequently, the highly efficient active oxygen species processes would occur for the degradation. It is proposed that the hole-related redox process plays a major role for the decomposition of RhB, because the CB potential of SnO2 seems too low for the electron to reduce O2 to generate O2 − (the E<theta>(O2/O2 −) is about −0.046eV). 4 Conclusions In conclusion, the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres have been fabricated by a facile two-step LPD method to attain excellent photocatalytic activities for the decomposition of RhB. The TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction structure can effectively promote an increase in the charge separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes within the composite structures to enhance photocatalytic reaction with respect to the performance of pure SnO2 and TiO2 hollow spheres. Furthermore, TiO2/SnO2 hollow sphere heterojunction shows no significant loss of activity in the recycling experiments. Considering the unique excellent properties of TiO2 and SnO2, the TiO2/SnO2 hollow spheres described herein presents a new approach which is expected to lead to a wide range of applications including photocatalysis, lithium ion batteries, and sensors.
