Methanol catalytic oxidation over VO x /Al2O3, VO x /ZrO2 and VO x /MgO catalysts has been studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It was found that stronger acid sites in VO x /Al2O3 result in almost the same selectivities for dimethoxymethane, paraformaldehyde and formic acid, and weaker acid sites in VO x /ZrO2 favor the formation of paraformaldehyde, while the VO x /MgO catalyst with the base support shows high selectivity for formate. Supporting VO x species on γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 leads to the formation of Brønsted acid sites as revealed by the adsorption of probe molecules. The acid strength of Brønsted acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst is found to be stronger than that of the VO x /ZrO2 catalyst which has the acid strength similar to zeolite HZSM-5's. The proposed bridging hydroxyl models accounting for the Brønsted acid sites formation were also confirmed by quantum chemical calculation. Graphical abstract Solid-state NMR spectroscopy results show that stronger acid sites in VO x /Al2O3 lead to almost the same selectivities for dimethoxymethane (DMM), paraformaldehyde and formic acid, and weaker acid sites in VO x /ZrO2 favor paraformaldehyde synthesis, while the VO x /MgO catalyst with base support shows high selectivity for formate. 13C single-pulse MAS NMR spectra (with proton decoupling) of methanol and oxygen reaction on VO x /Al2O3 at various temperatures. Keywords Methanol oxidation Vanadium oxide Solid-state NMR 1 Introduction Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are extensively used for the selective oxidation of methanol [1–8]. The structures and activities of these catalysts have been widely investigated in the past decades [9–18]. Among them, significant attentions were given to the studies of oxidation of methanol by the VO x /Al2O3, VO x /ZrO2 and VO x /MgO catalysts. However, most of the works have focused only on the nature of surface vanadium species. Isaguliants and Belomestmykh [17] suggested that the formation of pyrovanadate species (Mg2V2O7) in VO x /MgO makes the catalyst efficient for methanol oxidation, while Bars et al. [18] reported that vanadate dimmers are the active sites for oxidation dehydrogenation. Generally, in addition to the vanadium species, the support also plays a crucial role during the methanol oxidation reaction. Unfortunately, the acidic nature of these catalysts and their influence on the product distribution remain unknown. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a well-established technique to trap the intermediates in the heterogeneous reaction and reveal structures of catalysts [19–23]. With the application of the probe molecules, it is successfully applied in characterizing the acidity of various solid acid catalysts [24–33]. Theoretical calculation can reveal the acid strength, interactions between probe molecule and acid sites as well as the reaction transition state formed on zeolites [34–37]. Haw and co-workers [36–39] calculated proton affinity (PA) and 13C chemical shift of adsorbed 2-13C-acetone in order to measure the acidic strength of various solid acids. Our previous studies [40] also demonstrated that theoretical calculation is an efficient method to predict 13C chemical shifts of various organic species adsorbed on zeolites. In this contribution, three supported vanadium catalysts with different acidic properties were prepared by impregnation method. The catalytic oxidation reaction of methanol was investigated in detail by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Theoretical calculation was employed as well on the models that were proposed based on our NMR experimental results to study the structure and acidity of the catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Vanadium was introduced onto γ-Al2O3 (Merk), MgO (Merk) and ZrO(OH)2 [41] by wetness impregnation with an aqueous NH4VO3 solution. After impregnation, the materials were dried at 393K for 5h and then calcined at 773K for 12h in air. The physical characteristics of the catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The calcined sample was placed into a glass ampoule and activated at 673K under vacuum (10−3 Pa) for 5h. 1mmol methanol (13C, 99%, Cambridge Isotope Inc.) and 0.5mmolO2/g catalyst were adsorbed in the ampoule under vacuum at the temperature of liquid nitrogen and then the ampoule was flame sealed. Prior to NMR measurements, the sealed ampoule was warmed to room temperature, heated at the desirable temperature for 15min and then the reaction was quickly quenched by liquid nitrogen. For the adsorption of probe molecules, samples were kept at 673K under the vacuum at less than 1×10−3 Pa for at least 8h. To minimize the possible chemical exchange and polymerization, the adsorption of 2-13C-acetone was done at room temperature with a loading of ca. 0.1mmol/g catalyst. The adsorption procedure of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) was different from that of 2-13C-acetone. About 0.5g dehydrated sample was mixed with 3ml CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1M TMPO in a glovebox before the mixture was stirred for 3h by an ultrasonic shaker, allowed to equilibrate for 5h and then evacuated under vacuum to remove CH2Cl2 completely before NMR measurements. 2.2 Sample characterization All the NMR experiments were carried out at 9.4 T on a Varian Infinityplus-400 spectrometer with resonance frequencies of 400.12, 100.4 and 161.9MHz for 1H, 13C and 31P, respectively. The 90° pulse widths for 1H, 13C and 31P were measured to be 3.7, 4.4 and 3.6μs, respectively. The chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) for 1H, to hexamethylbenzene (HMB) for 13C and to 85% H3PO4 solution for 31P, respectively. Repetition times of 6s for 1H and 60s for 31P single-pulse experiments were used. The magic-angle spinning (MAS) rate was 5kHz. Single pulse 13C MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 10s recycle delay, allowing a quantitative measurement of the 13C signals. Cross polarization with interrupted decoupling is also employed for spectral assignments. 2.3 Computational method The optimizations and chemical shift predictions were carried out using Amsterdam density-functional (ADF) package [42] with the local spin density approximation for exchange and correlation potential employing the Vosko–Wilk–Nusair generalized gradient approximations (GGA) used for the density gradient correction to the exchange and correlation function [43,44]. The triple-zeta basis set including two polarization functions (TZ2P) based on Slater-type orbital (STO) was chosen. 1s–4p orbitals for Zr, 1s–3p orbitals for V and 1s–2p orbitals for Al atoms were kept frozen with the frozen core approximation, while all electron basis sets for the O, C and H atoms are used in the structure optimizations and NMR calculations. It was demonstrated that the relativistic effects are important for V and Zr atoms in defining the geometry of structure; therefore, the calculations were performed within the relativistic scheme with the zero-order regular approximation (ZORA) including the scalar effects [45]. Possible models (Scheme 1 ) were proposed for the Brønsted acid sites formed on the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts. No atom in acetone molecule was constrained during all the configuration optimizations of adsorption complexes. The 13C chemical shifts were calculated using the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) method on the optimized structure [46]. The 13C NMR isotropic chemical shift for the carbonyl carbon of acetone adsorption complexes was referenced to the NMR experimental value of the gas-state acetone (208ppm). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the 13C MAS NMR spectra of methanol and oxygen reaction on VO x /Al2O3 at various temperatures. After adsorption of methanol and oxygen on VO x /Al2O3 at 373K, four resonances are observable at 49, 53, 69 and 97ppm. The relatively intense signal at 49ppm is assigned to methoxyl group [20]. This species cannot be easily removed by vacuum pumping, indicating that it should correspond to surface-bound species. The intensity of this signal gradually decreases as the reaction temperature increase. The signal at 53ppm is due to the physisorbed methanol [20], which can be easily removed by vacuum pumping. The resonance at 69ppm is likely due to the ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) [47], and the signal at 97ppm arises from the methylene of dimethoxymethane (DMM) [48]. The appearance of the new signal at 162ppm (due to formic acid) [49] and a small signal at 90ppm (due to paraformaldehyde) [20] indicates that methanol has been further oxidized as the temperature is elevated to 423K. When the reaction temperature further increases, the intensity of the 162 and 97ppm decreases, indicating that high temperature does not favor the formation of formic acid and DMM. We also found that the intensity of the signal at 58ppm (due to dimethyl ether) [50] increases remarkably as the temperature increases from 423 to 573K. When the temperature is higher than 523K, methanol has been oxidized into CO2 (at 126ppm) [49]. The resonance at 113ppm is due to the background of the probe. By careful integration of the various 13C NMR signals (Table 2 ), we can find that on the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivities for DMM (23.2%), paraformaldehyde (30.2%) and formic acid (29.2%) at 473K are very close. 13C MAS NMR spectra of methanol and oxygen reaction on VO x /ZrO2 at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 . After heating the sample at 373K for 15min, the signal at 73ppm (due to ethylene glycol) appears significantly. The amount of DMM (97ppm) increases when the temperature is increased from 373 to 423K. As the reaction temperature increases further from 423 to 473K, the intensity of paraformaldehyde (90ppm) increases while the amount of DMM (97ppm) decreases considerably. A trace of formic acid (162ppm) is detected at 473K. As the reaction temperature increases further to 573K, the signals of formic acid, DMM and paraformaldehyde all disappear and the 126ppm signal of CO2 emerges, indicating that some of the hydrocarbons are oxidized into CO2. Compared with the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /MgO catalysts (Table 2), the VO x /ZrO2 catalyst seems to display higher selectivity for paraformaldehyde (71.2%) at 473K. 13C MAS NMR spectra of methanol and oxygen reaction on VO x /MgO at various temperatures are given in Fig. 3 . One dominant resonance at 49ppm is observed at 423K, characteristic of methoxyl group. Signals at 62 and 168ppm (due to dimethyl ether and formate, respectively) are present when the reaction temperature increases to 473K [51], which is indicative of the occurrence of methanol dehydration to form dimethyl ether and oxidation to form formate. As the reaction temperature increases to 523K, the intensity of signal at 168ppm increases and a trace of formic acid (at 162ppm) is also formed. When the temperature further increases to 673K, almost all the methanol is oxidized into formate, which suggests that the VO x /MgO catalyst has higher selectivity for formate compared with the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts. It is interesting that the signals of dimethoxymethane (DMM) cannot be detected in the VO x /MgO sample, indicating that Brønsted acid sites play a crucial role in the formation of dimethoxymethane. The higher selectivity (79.4% at 473K, Table 2) of the catalyst VO x /MgO for formate is probably due to the basic property of the MgO support. In spite of their similar 13C isotropic chemical shifts, formate and carbonate could always be easily distinguished based on their response to interrupted decoupling [20]. The methyl formate signals did not survive interrupted decoupling, as expected for a protonated carbon in a relatively rigid species. On the other hand, signals of carbonate species were not attenuated by interrupted decoupling. In the present case, the intensity of 168ppm signal decrease significantly in the interrupted decoupling experiment (result not shown), which allows us to assign unambiguously this signal detected in the 13C NMR spectra to formate. As demonstrated by Haw and co-workers [27,52], 2-13C-acetone can be used as a reliable NMR probe molecule to evaluate the acidic strength of solid acids. The stronger Brønsted acidity will result in stronger hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl carbon and the acidic proton, and consequently, the more downfield of the 13C isotropic chemical shift. Fig. 4 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of 2-13C-acetone adsorbed on VO x /MgO, VO x /ZrO2 and VO x /Al2O3. The signals at 208, 198, 155, 83, 72 and 28ppm can be assigned to bimolecular, trimolecular and mesityl oxide reaction products of acetone [52]. In Fig. 4a, there is no peak arising from the acetone adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites, implying the absence of the Brønsted acid sites in the VO x /MgO catalyst. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 2-13C-acetone adsorbed on VO x /ZrO2 (Fig. 4b), two signals (at 223 and 217ppm) were resolved in the deconvoluted spectrum. The former signal is originated from unreacted acetone adsorbed on the newly formed Brønsted acid sites, while the latter is ascribed to acetone adsorbed on the weakly acidic ZrOH groups present on ZrO2 [53]. The chemical shift of 223ppm indicates that acid strength of VO x /ZrO2 catalyst is close to that of the bridging OH group in zeolite HZSM-5, where adsorbed 2-13C-acetone gives rise to a 13C resonance at 223ppm. Similarly, two dominant signals at 217.5 and 225ppm (due to acetone adsorbed on the weakly acidic AlOH groups and the bridging Brønsted acid sites, respectively) can be observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of acetone adsorbed on VO x /Al2O3 (Fig. 4c). From the 13C acetone NMR results, it can be concluded that the VO x /Al2O3 has an acid strength slightly stronger than the VO x /ZrO2 and no Brønsted acid site is present in the VO x /MgO catalyst. We also used 2-13C-acetone as a probe molecule to study the acid sites present on the vanadium oxide (prepared by NH4VO3 calcination at 823K for 5h), MgO, ZrO2 and γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 5 ). Besides the peaks associated with diacetone or triacetone alcohol (72 and 29ppm) and mesityl oxide (208, 198, 146, 132 and 53ppm) [52], the main 13C signal at 217ppm can be ascribed to acetone adsorbed on the weakly acidic hydroxyl (ZrOH or AlOH) groups on ZrO2 and γ-Al2O3, indicating the absence of Brønsted acid sites present on these oxides. Obviously, the introduction of vanadium species onto the supports (γ-Al2O3, ZrO2) leads to the formation of new Brønsted acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts. For the VO x /MgO catalyst, the Brønsted acid site is unlikely formed because of the strong base site present on the MgO support. Deng and co-workers [54,55] considered that the bridging –Mo–OH–Zr–, –W–OH–Zr– and –Mo–OH–Sn– groups were responsible for the strong Brønsted acid sites generated in the MoO x /ZrO2, WO x /ZrO2 and MoO x /SnO2 solid acids, respectively. In our case, it is likely that the strong Brønsted acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts are also generated by the bridging –V–OH–Al– and –V–OH–Zr– groups. In order to detect the Lewis acid site on the catalysts, we recorded 31P single-pulse MAS NMR spectra of TMPO adsorbed on the three samples. As shown in Fig. 6a, only one resonance at 43ppm is observed in the 31P NMR spectrum of TMPO adsorbed on the VO x /MgO catalyst, and this signal can be ascribed to physisorbed TMPO [33]. The adsorption of TMPO onto the VO x /ZrO2 catalyst produces a very broad hump of 31P signal (Fig. 6b). By spectral deconvolution, three signals at 47, 58 and 68ppm can be found. The signal at 47ppm is due to physisorbed TMPO [56], while the other two signals at 58 and 68ppm can be assigned to TMPO adsorbed on the weakly acidic ZrOH groups and the Brønsted acid sites, respectively. For the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 6c), three 31P NMR signals are observed at 43, 55 and 69ppm. Similar assignment can be made with the former being assigned to physisorbed TMPO and the later two to TMPO adsorbed on the weakly acidic AlOH groups and the Brønsted acid sites, respectively. Based on our TMPO experimental results, we can conclude that the concentration of Lewis acid site on the catalysts is too low to be detected by NMR. Therefore, the role of Lewis acidity in the catalytic reaction can be neglected. The quantum chemical calculation method was used to predict the acidic strength of the bridging hydroxyl groups in our proposed models containing VO, V–O–V and V–O–Al (or Zr) bonds. The existence of these bonds was confirmed by UV and visible Raman spectroscopies [16]. The optimized structures of acetone adsorbed on the bridging Brønsted acid sites of the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . Generally, the stronger the Brønsted acidity, the stronger the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen and acidic proton, resulting in a longer CO bond length. In the complex structures, the bridging acidic O–H bond lengths are 1.060 and 1.024Å for acetone adsorbed on the bridging –V–OH–Al– and –V–OH–Zr– groups, respectively, and the distances between the acidic proton and carbonyl oxygen are 1.463 and 1.590Å, respectively. Meanwhile, the CO bond lengths increase from 1.220Å (in free gas state) to 1.238 and 1.231Å for acetone adsorbed on the bridging –V–OH–Al– and –V–OH–Zr– groups, respectively. The larger extent of elongation of the CO and the bridging O–H bond lengths in the adsorption complex on the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst suggests that its acidic strength is stronger than that of VO x /ZrO2 catalyst. The 13C isotropic chemical shifts of the carbonyl carbon for acetone on the bridging Brønsted acid sites were calculated, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 3 . The calculated 13C chemical shifts are 225.9 and 220.8ppm for acetone adsorbed on the acid sites of the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts, respectively, again indicative of the much stronger acid strength of the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst. Since the calculated 13C chemical shifts are very close to the experimentally measured values (225 and 223ppm, respectively), we believe that our proposed models can represent the structures of Brønsted acid sites formed on the catalysts after the introduction of vanadium species onto γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports. It is known that the VO x active content is very important to the oxidation performance of VO x -supported catalyst [16]. In the present case, the supports actually exhibit a significant effect on the product distribution of the methanol oxidation reaction. The stronger acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst surfaces direct almost the same selectivities for DMM, paraformaldehyde and formic acid, while paraformaldehyde is preferentially formed on the VO x /ZrO2 catalyst with less stronger acid sites and the VO x /MgO catalyst with the base support shows high selectivity for formate. Iglesia and co-worker [57] concluded that CH3OH converts to DMM via primary CH3OH oxidation reactions to form HCHO and subsequent secondary reactions of HCHO with CH3OH in steps requiring both redox and Brønsted acid sites. Brønsted acid sites are mainly involved in the formation of DMM from formaldehyde and CH3OH (Scheme 2 ). Our experimental results revealed that the main products are varied from DMM, paraformaldehyde and formic acid on VO x /Al2O3 to paraformaldehyde on VO x /ZrO2 and to formate on VO x /MgO as the acid strength of these catalysts decreases, which is consistent with Iglesia's findings. Therefore, different acidic nature of the supports may lead to very different catalytic activities. 4 Conclusions In summary, methanol catalytic oxidation over VO x /Al2O3, VO x /ZrO2 and VO x /MgO have been studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Our NMR experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that the supports have a great effect on the product distribution of methanol oxidation reaction over the supported vanadium oxide. Stronger acid sites in VO x /Al2O3 lead to almost the same selectivities for dimethoxymethane (DMM), paraformaldehyde and formic acid, while weaker acid sites in VO x /ZrO2 favor paraformaldehyde synthesis. Furthermore, the VO x /MgO catalyst with the base support exhibits high selectivity for formate. We also found that the interaction of VO x and supports (γ-Al2O3, ZrO2) leads to the formation of new Brønsted acid site on the VO x /Al2O3 and VO x /ZrO2 catalysts with acidic strength much stronger than that of the acid sites originally present on the supports. Our 2-13C-acetone NMR experimental reveals that the acid strength of bridging Brønsted acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 are stronger than that of VO x /ZrO2 catalyst which has the acid strength similar to zeolite HZSM-5. The quantum chemical calculation results of acetone adsorbed on the bridging Brønsted acid sites are in good agreement with our experimental observations.

        "dc:description": "Methanol catalytic oxidation over VO x /Al2O3, VO x /ZrO2 and VO x /MgO catalysts has been studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It was found that stronger acid sites in VO x /Al2O3 result in almost the same selectivities for dimethoxymethane, paraformaldehyde and formic acid, and weaker acid sites in VO x /ZrO2 favor the formation of paraformaldehyde, while the VO x /MgO catalyst with the base support shows high selectivity for formate. Supporting VO x species on γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2 leads to the formation of Brønsted acid sites as revealed by the adsorption of probe molecules. The acid strength of Brønsted acid sites on the VO x /Al2O3 catalyst is found to be stronger than that of the VO x /ZrO2 catalyst which has the acid strength similar to zeolite HZSM-5's. The proposed bridging hydroxyl models accounting for the Brønsted acid sites formation were also confirmed by quantum chemical calculation.",
