Taichung 402 Taiwan, ROC ⁎ Corresponding author. By controlling the synthesized conditions such as the compositions, pH and hydrothermal temperature of the In (or NH4)-V-O compounds, the structural information have been determined with the potential application in the hydrogen evolving efficiency. When the addition of ammonium ions to adjust the pH with the hydrothermal time of 4h, there is a maximum hydrogen production of 140.8μmol/g·cat. The maximum hydrogen production reaches at pH of 5. In addition, the (NH4)2V6O16 phase in the synthesized InVO4 has been observed. This crystalline ammonia vanadium-based material is capable to perform the photocatalysis process in hydrogen evolving. Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis Photocatalysis Hydrogen production InVO4 (NH4)2V6O16 1 Introduction Semiconductor photocatalysis has attractively been interested because of its special photocatalytic and electrochemical properties to split water into clean-energy hydrogen under solar energy [1–3]. Ye et al. have investigated the photocatalytic efficiency of InMO4 series (M=V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+) under visible light irradiation [4]. The band gap of InVO4 (1.9eV) depicts much narrower than those of InTaO4 (2.6eV) and InNbO4 (2.5eV). This suggests that InVO4 is possibly more efficient at photocatalytic production of H2 from water under visible light irradiation. Also, Fei et al. [5] have discussed that the molar ratio with In/V and pH value synthesize a single phase of InVO4, and InVO4 has been found to be a new photocatalyst because the chemical stability and lower band gap of about 1.9eV. However, the previous studies commonly use the sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH and result in the formation of the Na2V6O16. The formation of Na2V6O16 prevents to form an active InVO4 phase at higher pH value. From literatures survey, ammonium vanadium oxides possess the advantages of low cost, easy to synthesize and high-energy density, and thus have much interested for further investigations [6–11]. Various ammonium vanadium oxide nano-structures have been applied as lithium-ion battery cathode materials, such as NH4V4O10 nano-belts [12,13], (NH4)2V6O16 nano-rods [14], NH4V3O8·0.2H2O flakes [15] and NH4V3O8 nano-rods [16]. In addition, (NH4)2V6O16 is a member of the Hewettite (M2V6O16·nH2O, M=monovalent element, and MV6O16·nH2O, M=divalent element) group [17], and is a typical layered structure which consists of V3O8 layers which composed of VO6 and V2O8 units and interstitial hydrated NH4 + and found to be potential Li+lithium-ion battery materials. Nevertheless, ammonium vanadium oxide species have not been investigated in photocatalytic application. In our preliminary studies, it appears that ammonium vanadium oxide possesses the photocatalytic ability. Therefore, ammonia hydroxide has been used to replace sodium hydroxide to control the solution pH, and synthesized the InVO4 crystalline phase by hydrothermal method. The formation of (NH4)2V6O16 and InVO4 phase can be optimized by pH value and hydrothermal treatment time. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Catalyst preparation The InVO4 powder were firstly prepared by hydrothermal process from InCl3 (Indium(III) chloride, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and NH4VO3 (Ammonium metavanadate, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) precursors. The InCl3 and NH4VO3 was dissolved in 40ml distilled water separately, and controlled at a specific In:V molar ratio of 1:2. The InCl3(aq) solution was then mixed with NH4VO3(aq) drop wisely and adjust the pH value to 3, 5, 7, and 9 by adding proper amount of ammonium hydroxide. After continuous stirring for 1h, the mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Hydrothermal treatment was set to 1, 4, 6, and 8h under 200°C. After completing the hydrothermal procedures, the powder was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times. The powder was dried under 60°C in vacuum oven for 1h. For (NH4)2V6O16, the previous procedures were repeated without the addition of InCl3, the hydrothermal conditions were controlled under pH=5, hydrothermal temperature at 200°C with 4h reaction time to form the (NH4)2V6O16. For comparison, the previous procedures were repeated and used the sodium hydroxides to adjust pH value, the hydrothermal conditions were controlled under pH=5, hydrothermal temperature at 200°C with 4h reaction time to form the Na2V6O16 instead of (NH4)2V6O16 and InVO4 crystalline phases. 2.2 Characterizations The crystalline phase of InVO4 with/without the presence of the (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD) with a CuKα irradiation (λ=1.5406Å). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 spectrophotometer using the standard KBr disc method. The absorbance of catalyst over the spectrum range of 420–800nm was determined by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). The micro-structural morphology was observed by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-7401F). The above characterization techniques were performed as a function of pH value and hydrothermal treatment time. 2.3 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a closed gas circulation system. A 0.15g of powder sample was suspended in 300ml distilled water contain 100ml methanol within a quartz reactor. A 300W Xe lamp was placed in center of reactor. The gases evolved were analyzed with a TCD equipped gas chromatograph (China chromatography, GC9800). The hydrogen product rate was quantified using the calibration curve. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystalline phase of In (or NH4)-V-O as a function of preparation conditions The XRD patterns of pure (NH4)2V6O16, InVO4, and synthesized In-V-O as a function of preparation conditions are shown in Fig. 1 . All catalysts possesses a peak at 2θ=33.052°, which is the characteristic peak of InVO4, and 2θ=11.323° is the characteristic of the (100) peak of the (NH4)2V6O16. It appears that the crystalline structure of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst with the In:V=1:2 ratio is in good agreement with the orthorhombic InVO4-III phase (JCPDS 48-0898) and (NH4)2V6O16 phase (JCPDS 79-2051). The XRD patterns of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst as a function of hydrothermal treatment time are also shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic XRD peaks of InVO4 are not well defined for only 1h reaction time. It's insufficient to form InVO4 phase, and the (NH4)2V6O16 phase is dominate in the crystalline structure according to XRD results. Upon increasing the treatment time from 2 to 8h, the well-defined InVO4 phase can be observed, and the (NH4)2V6O16 phase becomes less intensity in the crystalline structure. In addition to hydrothermal time, the pH value of the solution is also an essential factor to control the formation of InVO4 phase and are shown in Fig. 1. When the solution of pH has been adjusted to 3, there is no strong XRD crystalline peaks of the InVO4 phase. This indicates that the (NH4)2V6O16 structure is favor in acidic environments. Upon increasing pH to 5 and 7, the InVO4 and (NH4)2V6O16 phase coexist due to the appearance of both structure's XRD patterns. However, only the In(OH)3 species remains (JCPDF 73-1810) upon the pH reaching to 9. This also indicates that the indium ions are much stable in basic conditions and not easy to combine with the vanadium ions at higher pH value. 3.2 FT-IR analysis of In (or NH4)-V-O as function of preparation conditions In Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst as a function of different hydrothermal treatment time and pH value. It shows that the main IR bands at 755 and 898cm−1, which are attributed to V-O-In stretching modes [18]. This indicates that the formation of the crystalline InVO4 phase, and the peak intensities characteristic of the V-O-In vibrational modes increase with increasing hydrothermal time. It is consistent with the XRD result. The IR bands at 1403 and 1614cm−1 are characteristic of the bending vibrations of the NH4 + and H-O-H species [19]. It appears that the (NH4)2V6O16 species co-exist in all the synthesized In-O-V catalysts. In addition, the IR bands in the 3000–3500cm−1 region are attributed to hydroxyl groups [20], and indicate that the hydrolysis state appearing in the low hydrothermal time (lower than 1h) prevents the formation of the crystalline InVO4 phase. The FTIR spectra of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst as a function of different pH are also shown in Fig. 2. It is consistent with the previous studies that the (NH4)2V6O16 species co-exist in all the synthesized In-O-V catalysts at lower pH value below 7. Upon the pH value increase to 9 with 1h of hydrothermal process, new IR bands appearing in 1150, 3112 and 3232cm−1 are characteristic of In(OH)3 hydroxyl stretching and bending vibrations [21]. This indicates that In(OH)3 is much stable than the formation of InVO4 under basic environments which is shown in the following equations [22]: In 3 + + 3 OH − → In OH 3 VO 3 − + OH − → VO 4 3 − + H + In OH 3 + VO 4 3 − → InVO 4 + 3 OH − 3.3 UV–Vis spectra of In(or NH4)-V-O as a function of preparation conditions The UV–Vis spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3(a) represents the spectra of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst as a function of different hydrothermal treatment times, and Fig. 3(b) represents the spectra with different pH values. The results indicate that a significant absorbance shifts toward higher wavelength (above 440nm) which is the range of the visible light. The XRD results have indicated that the specific crystalline peaks of (NH4)2V6O16 are observed, and UV–Vis spectra show the shift of the (NH4)2V6O16 absorbance toward the visible light after 1h hydrothermal treatment time. The XRD and UV–Vis results indicate the coexist of the InVO4 and (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase with increasing the hydrothermal time from 2 to 8h. The InVO4 and (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase also coexist upon the pH value increasing to 3 and higher, however, there is a phase transformation of the synthesized In-V-O catalyst into In(OH)3 with further increasing pH value to 9. Thus, the shift of absorption toward visible light results from the coexistence of (NH4)2V6O16 and InVO4 phase in the synthesized In-V-O catalysts. 3.4 Hydrogen evolving efficiency over the synthesized In-V-O materials The amount of the cumulative hydrogen over the synthesized In-V-O catalysts was monitored by GC analysis. The first 4h accumulation time of hydrogen molecular reaching to 102.7μmol/g·cat (see Fig. 4 ) indicates that the hydrogen production rate of the synthesized In-V-O with In:V=1:2 is much higher than that of the pure InVO4 (74.6μmol/g·cat), and pure (NH4)2V6O16 (65μmol/g·cat). With the comparison of the formation of the Na2V6O16 phase in the InVO4 crystalline phase, the hydrogen evolving efficiency was determined about 101.6μmol/g·cat and is much lower than the synthesized InVO4 catalyst with ammonia hydroxide. From previous structural information, the presence of (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase in the InVO4 nano-structure possessed the highest hydrogen evolving efficiency. In addition, the pure (NH4)2V6O16 is capable for the hydrogen production from water decomposition. The relative ratios of (NH4)2V6O16 to InVO4 crystalline phase can be finely tuned by hydrothermal time and pH value, in order to further enhance the hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen yields of the synthesized In-V-O with In:V=1:2 as a function of hydrothermal time are also shown in Fig. 4. The hydrogen yields after 4h accumulative time of the synthesized In-V-O with In:V=1:2 at 1h hydrothermal treatment time reaches only to 69.9μmol/g·cat. This indicates that the reaction time is too short to form the well-defined InVO4 structure, and only pure (NH4)2V6O16 phase is clearly observed by XRD. The formation of the well-defined InVO4 has been observed in the higher hydrothermal treatment time (above 2h), and the hydrogen yields increases with increasing hydrothermal time. XRD results indicate the formation of both InVO4 and (NH4)2V6O16 mixed structure results in the increase of hydrogen yields. However, the hydrogen yield starts to decrease with further increasing hydrothermal time to 8h. It appears that the (NH4)2V6O16 species sintering into a larger bar-shaped structure (see Fig. 5 ) after longer hydrothermal time. Thus, the optimizing hydrothermal time is set on 4h. The formation of the InVO4 with (NH4)2V6O16 in the structure can be controlled by pH values, and the hydrogen yields of the synthesized In-V-O with In:V=2:1 as a function of pH values are also shown in Fig. 4. At lower pH of 3, the relative ratio of (NH4)2V6O16 to the InVO4 is higher and hydrogen yield after 4h accumulation time reaches to 113.9μmol/g·cat. The relative ratio of (NH4)2V6O16 to the InVO4 starts to decrease with increasing pH value. The highest hydrogen yield reaches to 140.8μmol/g·cat at pH of 5. The In(OH)3 phase forms at higher pH value of 9, and results in the decrease of hydrogen yield. The effect of the morphology of InVO4, SEM images find that when hydrothermal treatment conditions were 200°C, pH was equal to 5, and treatment time was 4h (see Fig. 5). It can be formed a spherical and uniform size of the In-V-O crystalline particles, and only slightly tubular shape crystalline produced. Compare to the morphology of pure InVO4, it appears that the tubular crystalline species is due to the presence of the (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase. According to 1D structure of (NH4)2V6O16 mentioned before, it provides the unique advantage of introducing conductive pathways to improve the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This is similar to the effect of the Na2V6O16·xH2O material on photocatalytic activity [23] since the (NH4)2V6O16 crystalline phase possesses the ability to proceed the photocatalytic on hydrogen evolving. Thus, the coexistence of the (NH4)2V6O16 phase in InVO4 structure affects the hydrogen yield of the In-V-O materials. 4 Conclusion A facile template-free hydrothermal method for the synthesis of InVO4 has been presented by controlling the molar ratio of Indium and Vanadium to 1:2, hydrothermal time and pH value. It found that InVO4 consists of highly crystalline nanocrystals with the presence of (NH4)2V6O16, and exhibits a higher reactivity and improved optical absorption property. In addition, InVO4 with the presence of (NH4)2V6O16 exhibits photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen involving. The higher photocatalytic activity of the catalyst is mainly attributed to formation of (NH4)2V6O16 in the InVO4 crystalline phase.
