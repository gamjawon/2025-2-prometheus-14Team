Everson *, Harko Mulder 1, Martin J. Keyser 2 Department of Chemical Engineering, Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, Potchefstroom, 2520, South Africa Received 17 May 1995; revised 7 January 1996; accepted 29 January 1996 Abstract A mathematical model for a non-isothermal fixed bed reactor with supported ruthenium catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas was developed and tested with experimental results. A two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model with the well-known power law for the reaction rate was found to be suitable after consideration of all the possible transport mechanisms occurring under conditions favouring the formation of useful gaseous, liquid and solid (waxes) hydrocar- bons. The reaction rate was evaluated by a non-linear regression technique in order to demonstrate the validity of the equation and the associated constants for a fixed bed. It was found that the hydrogenation and/or polymerisation reactions occurring along the length of the fixed bed reactor influenced the reaction rate constants for the conversion of carbon monoxide conversion, whereas, the reaction rate constants for the formation of methane remained unaffected when compared with results obtained from a differential bed reactor. Reaction rate constants are also reported for the formation of a light gas fraction (C2 to C4). Keywords.\" Fischer-Tropsch; Ruthenium; Fixed bed; Model; Rate equation 1.

EL~erson et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 Many of these investigators examined the effect of operating conditions, bed length and the presence of secondary reactions on the products formed. Inglesia et al. [6] and Everson and Mulder [5] studied the formation and readsorption of alkenes and the subsequent initiation of secondary surface reaction leading to chain growth over ruthenium catalysts. King et al. [7] examined the durability of supported ruthenium catalysts under conditions favouring liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as a motor fuel. The mathematical modelling of a fixed bed reactor with a catalyst consisting of iron and manganese oxides was reported by Bub and Baerns [8] with reaction data obtained from a laboratory scale micro-reactor. The model results were compared with experimental measure- ments and the deviations observed were attributed to unsatisfactory reaction rate data. Blanks [9] reported results from an investigation involving the modelling of a reactor consisting of a series of coiling coils located within a fixed bed reactor packed with a cobalt-based catalyst. Blanks was able to predict tempera- ture profiles quite accurately at low conversions of carbon monoxide. There are no published results in the literature involving the development of a mathemati- cal model for a fixed bed reactor with supported ruthenium catalysts. The development of reaction rate models and the evaluation of constants for intrinsic reaction rates over supported ruthenium metal on various oxide sup- ports have been investigated extensively by many workers [10-18]. All these investigators used laboratory-scale micro-reactors operating under ideal reaction conditions and in most cases involving low carbon monoxide conversions with a narrow product spectrum consisting of mostly gases. Differential and Berty reactors have been used in which concentration and temperature gradients are absent. A reaction rate involving only the partial pressures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen raise to some power (power law) has been derived and discussed by Kellner and Bell [11] and Vannice [12] and has been used extensively by many researchers. There is however, no agreement between the results published regarding the absolute values of the constants. Dixit and Taviarides [18], Sarup and Woiciechowski [19] and many other investigators have derived rate equations for the Fischer Tropsch reaction based upon mechanistic equations of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson form involving one characteristic rate determining reaction. Rate equations based upon complex mechanistic models normally require a large number of constants which are not easy to obtain [19]. Also, there are no quantitative results available in the literature because of the complexity involved. Dixit and Taviarides [18], however, also deduced that at high conversions of carbon monoxide over ruthenium catalyst that the partial pressures of only carbon monoxide and hydrogen are important for the determination of the rate equation (power law). The experimental determination of reaction rates from fixed bed data (integral bed) with the aid of a non-linear regression technique is well known [20] and has the advantage that the reaction rates are evaluated under conditions similar to R.C. Everson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 225 conditions prevailing in industrial fixed bed (tubular) reactors. This technique, however, evaluates an average rate equation for the entire bed length and requires accurate material and energy balances in order to assess linear veloci- ties, temperatures and concentrations at different positions in the fixed bed. The development of a model for a catalytic fixed bed reactor, involving highly exothermic reactions in a jacket-cooled reactor, requires a systematic evaluation of the different heat and mass and momentum transport mechanisms. For this purpose equations and criteria have been proposed by various investiga- tors [20-23] for the assessment of the significance of interparticle, interphase and intraparticle diffusion as well as axial dispersion. An investigation was undertaken in our laboratories involving a non-isother- mal fixed bed reactor with a well-characterised ruthenium on ~/-alumina catalyst, to develop a mathematical model. This paper presents (1) a systematic develop- ment of a mathematical model for the fixed bed under conditions favouring the formation of a product spectrum consisting of useful hydrocarbons (gases, liquids and waxes), (2) an experimental evaluation of the reaction rate constants involving the power law only for the conversion of carbon monoxide and the formation of methane and a light gas fraction (C2 to C4), and (3) an experimen- tal verification of the model with the power law for the reaction rate with constants determined under different reactor conditions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Fixed bed reactor A sketch of the fixed bed reactor used to generate data for the evaluation of the mathematical model and the determination of the reaction rates by a non-linear regression technique, is shown in Fig. 1. A single stainless steel tube with a diameter of 20.93 mm and 1.6 m long is surrounded by a high pressure stainless steel jacket containing dowtherm under pressure. External heating of dowtherm is provided by electrical heating elements wrapped around the outside of the jacket. By boiling the dowtherm at different pressures, different jacket temperatures can be established which will also be constant along the entire length of the reactor as a result of the circulation of the dowtherm. Experiments are carried out by partially filling the reactor tubes with catalyst particles from the bottom upwards, thus providing a preheating section for the reacting mixture ahead of the catalyst packing for a downward flowing gas. Thermocouples are inserted into the packing with the tips situated at the centre of the tube and 150 mm apart along the length of the reactor. 2.2.

Sketch of reactor system. regression technique with the model from fixed bed reactor data, consisted of a packing in a 12.5 mm diameter stainless steel tube with the necessary heating elements [5]. The catalyst loading was 2.1 g and the flow rate through the packing was such that the carbon monoxide conversion was less than 5% thus ensuring that there were no concentration and temperature profiles. The synthe- sis gas was preheated to the desired reaction temperature in the unpacked portion of the reactor preceding the catalyst packing. The catalyst and the R. C. Everson et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 227 operating conditions were such that all diffusional effects were negligible according to well-known established criteria [24]. 2.3. Materials used All gases used were of high purity supplied from prepared high pressure gas bottles with the necessary flow measurement and pressure adjustment. The catalyst used in both the fixed and differential bed reactors is a commercial preparation of 0.5% (mass) ruthenium on ~/-alumina obtained from Engelhardt Industries. The catalyst is in the form of approximately 3 3 mm cylindrical pellets with the ruthenium metal impregnated only on the outer shell of the pellet to a depth of approximately 150 microns. From chemisorption experi- ments it was established that the metal dispersion was approximately 43% with a corresponding average crystallite diameter of 24 A. 2.4. Experimental procedure and analysis The catalyst loading inside the fixed bed and differential bed reactors were reduced with pure hydrogen at 350 and atmospheric pressure with a flow rate of 330 ml/min for 15 h. After this period synthesis gas at a desired pressure and temperature was introduced into the reactor and samples were taken at regular intervals. During the initial reaction period an unsteady state behaviour was observed which was followed by a pseudo-steady state operation. Results reported in this paper were calculated from analysis of products taken during the pseudo steady-state period only. The product stream was allowed to pass through a condenser, to remove high molecular weight hydrocarbons and a sampling valve fitted inside a gas chromatograph. Analysis of the products were carried out with a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph equipped with TCD and FID detection, fitted with a SE30 capillary steel column and a 2 m Porapak Q stainless steel column suitable for both the gas and liquid analyses. Experiments were conducted for a total of 24 h and with the aid of the gas analyses and an analysis of the liquid collected a complete product spectrum was calculated. The operating conditions for all the experimentation are given in Table I.

Everson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 3. Mathematical model 3.1. Model equations The development of the mathematical model involved the evaluation of the effects of radial transport of heat and mass, interphase and intraparticle transport of heat and mass, axial dispersion and the pressure drop across the catalyst packing. For extreme conditions occurring in a fixed bed reactor, such as the genera- tion of excessive heat (highly exothermic reactions) it is normal practice to include radial transport thus generating a two-dimensional model. Mears [21] proposed a criterion involving a complex dimensionless group and Finlayson [22] proposed a limitation on the Biot number calculated at the reactor wall; both these criteria are given in Appendix A. For the reactor system under considera- tion both criteria confirmed that a two dimensional model be used. For interphase transport between the gas phase and the catalyst surface, Mears [21] proposed a criteria for heat transport using a perturbation method. The method suggested by Mears was extended to mass transfer and heat transfer over cylindrical particles involving the power rate law and the results are given in Appendix B. By substituting values characteristic of the reactor under consideration in the respective equations it was found that interphase transport can be neglected. The effect of intraparticle diffusion of heat and mass was considered to be negligible because more than 88% of the ruthenium metal present is confined to a very thin layer with a thickness of 150 microns on the surface of the alumina pellets. Dixit [25] also examined similar catalysts and showed that pore diffusion is not important even at high carbon monoxide conversions. Mears [21] also indicated that interphase heat transport resistance becomes limiting before the intraparticle heat transfer provided the thermal Biot number is less than 10. A calculation for the catalyst and reactor under consideration gives of value of 0.378. Thus, since there is a negligible interphase resistance it follows that the intraparticle transport can also be neglected. The effect of axial dispersion can be established according to criteria put forward by Young and Finlayson [23]. The calculation shown in Appendix C confirms that axial dispersion can be neglected. Froment and Bischoff [20] proposed that axial dispersion can be ignored if the ratio of reactor length to particle size is greater than 150; which is the case for most of the experiments conducted in this investigation. A pressure drop over a catalyst bed can have a significant effect on the overall performance of the reactor and is normally included in the modelling of fixed bed reactors. It is shown in Appendix D that this effect is extremely small according to the Ergun equation and can be ignored. From the analysis of the different transport mechanisms (given above) it was R.C Everson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 229 deduced that a two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is applicable. The equations describing this model consists of a mass balance for a particular component and an overall energy balance and may be written as follows: EDer Or---5 + rOr ] Oz rppB =0 (1) where c (mol m-3) is the concentration of any component under consideration, is the bed voidage, Der (m2 s- l) is the effective radial diffusion coefficient, u (m s- 1 ) is the superficial linear velocity, rp (mol kg- l s- J ) is the reaction rate, PB (kg m-3) is the bed density, r (m) is the radial direction and z (m) is the axial direction. 10T ] OT 2T 7~r 0Z her ~-~] -GCp---PBrp(-AH)=O (2) where T () is the temperature of the catalyst bed, ~'er (W m-1 -l) is the effective radial thermal conductivity, G (kg m-2 s-1) is the mass flow rate of --1 o -1 the gas mixture, Cp (J kg C ) is the mean specific heat of the gas mixture and (- AH) (J mol-~) is the heat of reaction. The boundary conditions are: c( o,r) = co, T( o,r) = To (3) o (z,o) or(z,o) Or Or -0 (4) OT(Z,Ro) Or -o (5) r(z,eo) ~r Xer -- (T- Tw) (6) where R0 (m) is the radius of the reactor, a w (W m- 1 - ~) is the heat transfer coefficient at reactor wall and Tw () is the jacket temperature. The power law for the reaction rate developed by previous investigators [11-14,16-18] for a wide range of operating conditions and essentially for micro-reactors is assumed in this investigation for the prediction of the conver- sion of carbon monoxide and the formation of hydrocarbons [17]. It is also assumed that the functional form of the reaction rate and associated constants is constant over the total length of the fixed bed. Mechanistic models [19] involving absorption, complex surface reactions and desorption are considered too complex to handle because of the large number of unknown constants which 230 R.C. Everson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 restricts the validity of the non-linear regression technique developed in this investigation. The power law is the following. rp = koexp(-E/RT)p~o P~2 (7) where k0 is the pre-exponential term in the Arrhenius equation, E (kJ mol-~) is the activation energy, R (J mol 1 K- 1) is the universal gas constant, Pco (MPa) is the partial pressure of carbon monoxide, PH2 (MPa) is the partial pressure of hydrogen, a and b are experimentally determined empirical constants. The conversion X of carbon monoxide is given by, [ 0col x = (8) bloCo CO where u0 (m s 1) is the inlet superficial gas velocity and co (mol m-3) the inlet concentration. The wall heat transfer coefficient e~w and the effective radial thermal conductivity her, in Eq. (6), can be calculated using correlations published by Argo and Smith [26] and Beek [27] and the effective radial diffusion coefficient Der in Eq. (1) calculated using a correlation published by Froment and Bischoff [20]. 3.2. Method of solution and regression analysis The major problem with the solution of the above model is the calculation of the superficial linear velocity (u) as a result of the decrease in the number of moles involving many different products (C1 to C50). The stoichiometry of the reaction on ruthenium catalyst is governed essentially by; nCO + (2n + 1)H2 ~ CnH2n+2 + nH20 (9) which shows a total decrease of 2 moles for each mole carbon monoxide converted irrespective of the hydrocarbon formed. This property can be used to derive an expression for the linear velocity, at any position in the reactor at a temperature T, in terms of the inlet conditions of the gas mixture and the carbon monoxide conversion. For the reactor under consideration the following equa- tion is derived in Appendix E. T U = Uo(1- 2 YoX )--~o (101 where Y0 and To are the inlet mole fraction of carbon monoxide and inlet temperature respectively. Other methods for calculating the linear velocity based upon the average molecular weight of the gas mixture calculated from the product spectrum formed can also be used, but this would require prior knowledge of the reactor performance. It was found that the partial differential equations described above can be solved successfully with the implicit Crank-Nicholson method for the different R.C. Everson et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 231 components occurring in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. A non-linear regression algorithm, incorporating this model, based upon a direct search method pro- posed by Hooke and Jeeves (Himmelblau, [28]) was found to be very successful for the estimation of the rate constants. The objective function S which was minimized is; j=N j=M 2 S= Y'~ (~j_qj)2+ y, (~_ T1) (11) j=l j=l where ~j is the predicted conversion of carbon monoxide or rate of formation of methane or light hydrocarbon fraction and qj the corresponding experimental result, ~ is the predicted gas temperature and Tj the corresponding experimental result. Regression estimates were done for the four parameters (ko, E, a and b) appearing in the reaction rate equation (Eq. (7)) for each of the following: carbon monoxide conversion, methane formation and the formation of a light gas fraction (C2 to Ca). 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Reaction rate constants from differential bed reactor Experiments were carried out in the differential reactor under the conditions indicated in Table 1 and reaction rates were calculated for the hydrocarbons (C to C12) formed. Since the carbon monoxide converted was very low (less than 5%) and consequently difficult to measure accurately a calculation procedure involving the use of the Schultz-Flory distribution was adopted. The probability of chain growth c~ occurring in the Schultz-Flory equation w =noon_i(l_a)2 (12) where w, is the mass fraction of a carbon molecule with a carbon number n was evaluated from experimental results involving hydrocarbons from C1 to C~2. Since the distribution of the rates of formation of the hydrocarbons formed (rp)i are also a measure of the product distribution as predicted by the Schultz-Flory distribution, a plot of In (rp)i against carbon number (n) can also be used to evaluate a. Fig. 2 shows typical plots satisfying the Schultz-Flory distribution for C2 to Cl2 with the c~-values determined from the slopes. From this evaluation an estimate of the carbon monoxide used for the formation of hydrocarbons above C 12 was also included (which could not be measured). A standard linear regression technique was used to fit the reaction rate Eq. (7) to the experimental results and Table 2 shows the values of the constants obtained for carbon monoxide converted and methane formed. These results are also compared with the results obtained by Kirk [16] who used a catalyst with 232 R. C.

The results of Kirk were obtained at steady state condi- tions in a spinning basket reactor at high carbon monoxide conversions and with products consisting of gases and liquids (up to C t2). The activation energies reported for the conversion of carbon monoxide agree exceptionally well. The poor agreement between the other constants shows that the power rate law cannot describe reaction rates over a wide range of carbon monoxide conver- sions with the same set of constants.

These results show that there is an increase in the high molecular weight hydrocarbons with bed length at the expense of the low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Also Fig. 4 shows the change in the ratio of alkene to alkane for the different hydrocarbons at different bed lengths. As the bed length increases the ratio of alkenes to alkanes decreases indicating that hydrogenation and/or chain growth by polymerisation along the catalytic bed giving more high molecular weight hydrocarbons. The presence and effect of these secondary reactions over other catalyst have also been identified by other investigators. [2,3,6]. This effect is obviously not present in a differential reactor or a spinning basket reactor. It was also possible to obtain a spectrum of products under non-isothermal conditions, favourable for motor fuel processing, comparable with that produced in a isothermal reactor [5], and that obtained from an industrial reactor (Arge) with a promoted iron catalyst [29]. Table 3 shows the comparison. The temperature profiles obtained in the reactor for the different inlet temperatures used are shown in Fig. 5.

Reaction rate constants were evaluated by the non-linear regression procedure described above using fixed bed data for carbon monoxide converted, methane formed and a light gas fraction formed (C2 to Ca). The experimental results used consisted of concentration and temperature measurements made at four different positions in the reactor bed for four different inlet gas temperatures with a constant inlet flow rate (see Table 1). The reaction rate constants obtained by the non-regression analysis for carbon monoxide converted are shown in Table 4 and the predicted conversion profiles using these constants together with experiment results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Results from the model with reaction rate constants obtained from the differential bed reactor are also shown. With reference to Tables 2 and 4 it can be seen that the activation energies for carbon monoxide converted for all cases agree exceptionally well, but the constants a and b are very much different. The profiles in Figs. 6 and 7 calculated with constants from the differential bed do not agree at all with the experimental results. It was found that the model with reaction rate constants evaluated from data 6O 20- 0 , I , , 00 .20 .40 .60 .80 1.00 BED LENGTH (m) Fig. 6.

The non-linear regression technique with fixed bed data did not give different constants and could not improve the correlation coefficient. The presence of secondary reactions involving hydrogenation of alkenes (ethylene and higher) and/or polymerisation to form high molecular weight hydrocarbons along the length of the reactor (Fig. 2) is concluded to contribu- tion to the difference between the reaction rate constants obtained for carbon monoxide conversion The extent of the carbon monoxide conversion which is very low in the differential reactor is also considered to be a contributing effect. Since methane is not involved in secondary reactions its reaction rate would not be effected by the conditions mentioned and the experimental results obtained confirms this.

Finally, reaction rate parameters for the formation of a light gas fraction (C 2 to C4) were evaluated with the non-linear regression procedure and the results are shown in Table 4. The concentration profiles which agree very well with experimental results are shown in Fig. 9. 5. Conclusions A plug-flow pseudo-homogeneous model with radial transport of heat and mass and involving a reaction rate dependent on the concentration of the reactants only (power law) was derived, solved and successfully evaluated with experimental data. The variation of the superficial velocity of the gas mixture as a result of the stoichiometry of the reactions was accounted for in terms of the carbon monoxide conversion and temperature only. The evaluation involved the conversion of carbon monoxide and the formation of methane and a light gas fraction (C2 to C4) under reaction conditions favouring the formation of hydrocarbons useful for fuel manufacture. It was found that the power law for the reaction rates for the conversion of carbon monoxide and for the formation of methane and a light gas fraction (C2 to C4) is valid for a fixed bed reactor. The constants in the rate equation for the conversion of carbon monoxide, however, are different to the constants obtained from data from a differential bed reactor with low carbon monoxide conversions and very short contact times. It is deduced that the high carbon monoxide conversions and the presence of hydrogenation and/or polymerisation reactions involving alkenes in the fixed bed reactor has an effect on the value of the constants. The reaction rate constants for the formation of methane remained unaffected because the formation of methane is independent of hydrogenation and polymerisation reactions. 238 R.C. Everson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 223-241 Appendix A. Radial transport It has been proposed by Meats [21] and Finlayson [22] respectively that the following equations be used to determine whether radial transport is significant. 4KerRTwZ 1+ ~wdp ~ >0.4 (A1) c~ w R0 -- > 1 (A2) ~ker where R'(mol m-3 s-l) is the average reaction rate per unit bed volume, d (m) is the diameter of the reactor, dp (m) is the diameter (equivalent) of the catalyst particle and R0 (m)is the radius of the reactor. For the reactor under considera- tion and for an inlet temperature of 220, it is found that the dimensionless groups in Eqs. (A1) and (A2) are 3.7 and 12.0, respectively. Appendix B. Interphase transport [21] Using the power law for the conversion of carbon monoxide (Eq. (7)), the reaction rate with partial pressures of carbon monoxide Pco and hydrogen PH~ \" r s s close to the respective partial pressu es (p~o, PHi) at the surface of the catalyst can be obtained from a Taylor expansion of Eq.

For the reactor under consideration with assumed constants and for a 76% carbon monoxide conversion it was found that the terms on the left on Eq. (B4) gave a value of 1.6.10 5, which is much less than the required criterion. Substitution of the regressed values of the constants a and b obtained from the model also gives a much lower value. Similar criteria (Eq. (B4)) and results indicating negligible interphase trans- port can be derived for the products formed. For heat transfer with a power rate law for the reaction rate, a Taylor expansion around surface temperature TS gives the following: / = 1 + (TS- T) (B5) rp ] co RT2 From a heat balance over the surface of a cylindrical particle with a heat transfer coefficient hr (W m-: s 1) (-AHl(rcoP'BiTd~= hf(Ts- r)41vd~ (B6) Assuming the same criterion used above for mass transfer the following holds.

Substitution of typical values characteristic of the reactor under consideration gave a value of 0.007 for the group of terms on the left of Eq. (B7). Appendix C. Axial dispersion Young and Finlayson [23] stated that the following criteria must be satisfied before axial dispersion can be ignored. These are not priori criteria. dX maxl~Tz, I << Pem (C1) dT max[G---;, [ << Peh (C2) 240 R.C.

For the reactor under consideration the Peclet numbers are approxi- mately equal to 2 and the terms on the left of Eqs. (C1) and (C2) equal to values of the order of 0.02 calculated from results from a simulation based upon a one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model. Appendix D. Pressure drop The Ergun equation is applicable: AP 150(1 - 2ixuo 1.75(1 -pgU -- - + (D1) L E3(+dp)2 E!3+dp where A P (MPa) is the pressure drop, L (m) is the reactor length, e is the bed voidage, tx (kg m-] s-~) is the gas viscosity and d~ is the sphericity. For a catalyst bed of length 1 m with the catalyst and the operating conditions described in this paper a maximum pressure drop of the order of 2 10-5 MPa is obtained for a non-reacting system. Appendix E. Linear velocity From Eq. (9) it follows that the decrease in the total molar flow rate over any section of the reactor is 2 Nco where Nco(mol s-l) is the inlet molar flow rate of carbon monoxide and that the total molar flow rate is Nv(mol s- ~).

A mathematical model for a non-isothermal fixed bed reactor with supported ruthenium catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas was developed and tested with experimental results. A two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model with the well-known power law for the reaction rate was found to be suitable after consideration of all the possible transport mechanisms occurring under conditions favouring the formation of useful gaseous, liquid and solid (waxes) hydrocarbons. The reaction rate was evaluated by a non-linear regression technique in order to demonstrate the validity of the equation and the associated constants for a fixed bed. It was found that the hydrogenation and/or polymerisation reactions occurring along the length of the fixed bed reactor influenced the reaction rate constants for the conversion of carbon monoxide conversion, whereas, the reaction rate constants for the formation of methane remained unaffected when compared with results obtained from a differential bed reactor. Reaction rate constants are also reported for the formation of a light gas fraction (C2 to C4). Keywords Fischer-Tropsch Ruthenium Fixed bed Model Rate equation References [1] Atwood H.E. Bennet C.O.
