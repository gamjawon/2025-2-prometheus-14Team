Harrouch Batis, H. Batis *, A. Ghorbel Laboratoire de Chimie des Mat#riaux et Catalyse, Departement de Chimie, Faculte des Sciences de Tunis, 1060 Tunis, Tunisia Received 5 February 1996; revised 13 May 1996; accepted 22 May 1996 Abstract In order to investigate the effect of additives on the active sites of VPO catalysts, chromium doped catalysts have been prepared in aqueous medium. The Cr/V atomic ratio was limited to 2.5%. XRD, IR, XPS, isopropyl alcohol decomposition and n-butane oxidation tests were used for a comparative study of the bulk and surface properties of the catalysts. XRD analysis reveals that (VO)2P207 and VOPO4 phases are poorly crystallized. The XPS results show a strong surface enrichment of chromium in Cr-doped materials which is deleterious for the production of maleic anhydride (MA). At high conversion, catalyst deactivation occurred by surface coking. Keywords: VPO; Butane oxidation; Chromium; Doping; Maleic anhydride; Selectivity 1. Introduction The oxidation of butane over VPO catalysts has been the subject of consider- able research. Intensive studies were mainly focused on the catalyst preparation [1-4], the activation [3,5,6], the effect of P/V ratio [7-9], the search for active phases [10-15] and the reaction mechanism [15-19]. While academic studies deal with unpromoted VPO catalysts, the patent literature has concentrated on improving catalyst performance by inclusion of promoter compounds. Indeed introducing a doping agent was claimed to improve the MA yield. Numerous additives have been used, but promotional effects in VPO catalysts are little understood yet. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Batis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347 .361 However, it appears that the way in which promoters are added is of crucial importance and there is an optimal promoter/vanadium ratio which can be identified for several series of catalysts. Hutchings, in a recent review [20] has attempted to give some explanations about the promoter effects on VPO performance in the oxidation of n-butane to MA. Modifications of the (VO)zP207 structure or formation of solid solutions are claimed to enhance VPO catalytic properties, if a low amount of promoter is added. In the present investigation, a comparative study is carried out between undoped and Cr-doped VPO catalysts prepared in aqueous medium. For the ease of comparison of the catalyst performances, the P/V ratio is kept equal to unity and Cr/V ratios equal to 1% and 2.5%. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Catalysts were prepared in aqueous medium following a procedure fully described elsewhere [4,21]. Essentially this involves dissolution of a mixture of VC13 + V205 with V3+/V5+ atomic ratio equal to 1 in 90 ml of 37% HCI aqueous solution. Chromium dopant is added, as CrC13, in the desired propor- tion during the dissolution of VC13 + V205. The suspension is stirred continu- ously under reflux for 3 h. The appropriate amount of 85% H3PO4 required to have P/V = 1 is then added to the cooled solution which is refluxed and stirred for 3 h. A blue precipitate, obtained by evaporating the excess aqueous solution, is dried at 110 for 24 h. The Cr-doped solids are prepared with Cr/V = x atomic ratios equal to 1% and 2.5%. All catalyst precursors are heated in a flow of nitrogen for 16 h at 500 and will be hereinafter denoted VCPx. 2.2. Catalyst characterisation X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a Siemens diffractometer using Cu KoL radiation. Specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature, taking a value of 0.164 nm2 for the cross section of the adsorbed nitrogen molecule at this temperature. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 580 spectrophotometer using the KBr disc technique (0.5% dilution). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed with a VG ESCALAB 200R machine using the Mg Ka radiation (1253.6 eV). The data were collected with a digital VT 340 computer. The electron energy analyser N.H. Batis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 349 was operated at a pass energy of 50 eV. To compensate for possible charging effects, binding energies (BE) have been normalised with respect to the position of the Cls signal at 286.5 eV for VPO and at 289.8-289.6 eV for VCP catalysts. C ls, Ols, V2p, P2p and Cr2p peaks were recorded. The peak deconvolution is carried out with a non linear least-squares curve fitting program with a Gaussian-Lorentzian product function. Catalytic tests of n-butane oxidation and isopropyl alcohol (IA) dehydration and dehydrogenation have been described elsewhere [4,21]. Catalytic test equip- ment of n-butane oxidation was constructed in order to study catalytic oxidation of butane at atmospheric pressure with gas chromatography analysis on-line of reactants and products. The apparatus was automatically controlled. We used a differential flow microreactor made of pyrex glass (U-tube) with a continuous control of temperature beside the catalytic bed with a thermocouple. The reactor was heated by an electrical furnace. 0.1 or 0.5 g of each catalyst, in the form of powder, was placed in the reactor in a flow of nitrogen and pretreated at 500 for 1 h. The temperature was then lowered to 370 and the catalytic activity was measured by flowing 70 ml min- 1 of a mixture of 2.8% n-butane in dry air over the catalyst. The composition of gases was controlled with flowmeters. For the organic products, a Delsi IGC 120FL gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector was used. Helium was the carrier gas. The column was a 1-m 1/4\" Porapak. Butane, butene, furan, MA, acetic and acrylic acids were separated. For permanent gases and H20, a Delsi IGC 120 MB gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector was used. Helium was the carrier gas. Two columns were operated in series, a 3-m 1/4\" molecular sieve 5A column to separate O2,CO and N2, and a 2-m 1/4\" porapak Q column to separate CO2 and H20. Butane conversion (CBu) and MA selectivity were registered at the stationary state after stabilisation of the activity. Moreover, the stability of all catalysts was verified by measuring the catalytic performances 3 days after the steady state was reached, and by replicating the reference measurements. The catalytic decomposition of IA took place in a differential flow microreac- tor of pyrex glass with a perforated glass bed onto which 0.1 g of catalyst was placed. The system was heated in a tubular furnace with a control system to within + l. The catalyst, in the form of powder was placed in the reactor and heated at 500 for 1 h. The temperature was then lowered to 140. A regulated flow of helium used as carrier gas (70 ml/min), was saturated at a known temperature with the alcohol and this gaseous mixture, which can be diluted by a second stream of helium, was passed through the bed of VPO catalyst. The flow of carder gas was controlled by a soap-bubble flowmeter. The stream of helium was saturated with the alcohol by first passing in a saturator and subsequently in a condenser. Helium was assumed to be saturated with alcohol at the temperature of the condenser. In addition the partial pressure of alcohol was found to be constant to + 1% over a great range of flow rates, thus 350 N.H. Batis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 confirming saturation and also indicating no supersaturation. The partial pres- sure of alcohol in the gas stream was assumed to be the vapor pressure at the temperature of the condenser. The concentration of IA was 3.2% in helium. The exit gases were anaIysed by a Delsi Di 200 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector. Helium was the carrier gas. The column was 1-m 1,/8\" 10% chromosorb on carbowax 1500, and the temperature was 70. 3. Results 3.1. Solid structure Table 1 indicates the crystalline phases detected through XRD and the specific surfaces of the solids studied. All the precursors contain the VOHPO4, 1/2 H20 (HE phase) as the main crystalline phase. However, the VCPz5 spectra show also the presence of VOHPO4, 4 H20 (TH phase). The fresh catalysts contain the vanadyl pyrophosphate phase with broadened (200) reflection due to the presence of \"]VOPO4 in the VPO catalyst while VCP catalysts were poorly crystallized (Fig. 1A). After catalytic reaction, the used catalysts become relatively better crystal- lized (Fig. 1B). XRD spectra show additional peaks indicating the presence of (VO)2P207 as a major phase with different VOPO4 phases. Moreover, no peak is observed for any compound containing the dopant because of its presence in a very small amount. It is also evident from the nature of the peaks of Cr-doped catalysts (Fig. 1B, b-c) that the doping effect emphasizes the amorphous state of the VPO catalyst. The IR spectra of precursors show in all cases the characteristic bands of VOHPO4, 1/2 H20, while the fresh and the used catalyst spectra confirm the bad crystallization of the solids Fig. 2. From this study, it can be concluded that the crystallization of the main phases i.e VOHPO4, 1/2 H20 in the precursors and (VO)2P207 in the fresh Table 1 Physico-chemical characteristics of the catalysts Solids Precursors Fresh catalysts Used catalysts XRD (a) S (m2/g) XRD (a) S (m2/g) XRD (a) VPO HE 19 PV 17 PV, ~/, ~, ct II VCP~ HE a 8 a 8 a VCP2.5 HE,TH 12 ~ 10 a HE: VOHPO4, 1/2 H20, TH: VOHPO4, 4H20, PV: (VO)2 P207, '~: ~ VOPO4, g: ~VOPO4, ctlI: ctiiVOPO4. a Poorly crystallized or amorphous.

Catalytic properties and surface composition Catalytic properties of doped VPO catalysts in butane oxidation were studied at low ( < 10%) and high ( > 60%) butane conversion (CBu). The steady state is reached more than 16 h after the beginning of the reaction. For all catalysts, the results, measured 20 h after the beginning of the reaction, are summarized in Table 2.

MA, butene, furan and CO2 are detected at low conversion, however, only MA, CO2 and CO are produced at high conversion. With VCP catalysts, butene, furan and CO2 are produced early after the beginning of the reaction, while MA appears only 16 h after (Fig. 3). 100 S[ 25- 0 Y O\" D O~ S 20 I - 4+ 2b Fig. 3.

Batis et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 353 The specificity of Cr-doped catalysts, in these catalytic conditions, is the production of butene (Bu2-) and furan (Fu), which are not observed with the VPO catalyst. This result is indicative of different surface effects of Cr dopant on the nature of catalytic sites involved in the reaction steps. In general, if such intermediate compounds are produced during n-butane oxidation on VPO cata- lysts, they can be detected as desorption products only by using special low-pressure reaction environments [22] or by using catalysts with low activity to MA [23]. The intermediate species derived from n-butane are apparently rather tightly bound and then olefins are not likely to be intermediates for n-butane oxidation. Indeed activation of the paraffin has been suggested to involve V~O sites, and the dehydrogenated C4-hydrocarbon intermediate is proposed to be strongly adsorbed and constrained in such a manner that it reacts only at specific P-O-V sites. The latter are also involved in further incorpora- tion of oxygen to produce MA. Therefore, the question which arises is if any surface chromium compounds i.e chromium oxide and/or chromium phosphate, formed at the surface, have any, catalytic activity in the n-butane reaction. For this purpose, two catalysts, Cr203/AI203 and CrPO4, were tested in the same catalytic conditions as previously described. Both samples are selective only for butene and for carbon dioxide. As shown in Table 2, and in term of catalytic performances to MA produc- tion, the Cr dopant appears to be deleterious at low and high butane conversion. Note that for VCP catalysts, no butene and furan are produced but the selectivity to COx(Sco2, Sco) is drastically increased at high (60%) butane conversion. This would indicate that dehydrogenated intermediate compounds, when desorbed in the gas phase, may also give rise to side reactions of the total oxidation to carbon oxides, with a typical formation of CO products. The effect of temperature in the 350-430 range on the intrinsic rate is reported in Fig. 4. The increase of the reaction temperature decreases the MA selectivity more rapidly for VCP catalysts than for VPO. The apparent activation energies reported in Table 3 show that the activation energies for carbon dioxide formation are higher than those for MA formation. Comparatively the activation energies of the MA formation are larger for VCP catalysts than for VPO. The higher value of Ea(CO2) for the VPO catalyst indicates that the unselective oxidation of butane occurs at higher temperature than for VCP catalysts.

Batis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 The XPS results are reported in Table 4. An excess of P and O with respect to (VO)2P207 stoichiometry is observed. This trend is similar to the results of the literature [4,24-27]) where are reported surface P/V values in the range 2.6-3.0 for VPO catalysts with P/V > 1.1 in the bulk. This excess of P and O has been tentatively explained by the presence of VO(PO3)3 [27]. Doped VPO catalyst surfaces tend, also, to exhibit enrichment of phosphorus for a bulk P/V ratio close to unity and from the results shown in Table 4, the addition of Cr dopant seems to slightly affect the phosphorus surface enrichment but strongly increases the O/V ratio comparatively to the Cr exempted catalyst. Due to the inherently weaker Cr signals, the estimation of surface Cr/V ratios is accompanied by greater uncertainties than the estimation of surface Jt 't. % 30 o (rAM)VPO (rAM)VCP1 tm (rAM)VCP2,5 20 TO 620 6~o ~o ~o ~o 720 T (K) -1.5 tm * m -17 B Ln(rAM)VPO Ln(rAM)VCP1 i Ln(rAM)VCP2,5 -10 1,4 I[5 I[6 1/T xlO3 (K\" 1) Fig. 4.

The measured Cr/V ratios are considerably higher than those of the bulk. Then, it seems that chromium is highly segregated at the surface. The measured BE of the Crzp level is 577.4-577.5 eV which is intermediate between the BE associated to Cr3+ and Cr6+ ions [28]. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of Vzp peak of pure VOPO4 and (VO)2P207 phases is reported to be about 1.7 eV [29]. Moreover, different values of V2p BE have been reported, ranging for V5+ from 518.6 [30] to 517.2 [26]. However, the energy difference between the V5+ and V4+ oxidation state nearly always lies in the range 1.0 to 1.2 eV. For the samples studied in the present work, the fairly large Vzp peak (FWHM = 2.3-2.88 eV) is consistent with the presence of more than one oxidation state of V. The V2p peak has, therefore, been decomposed into two or three Gaussian component peaks with BE summarized in Table 5. In the case of VCP catalysts, the third component peak at almost 518 eV, is very weak (Fig. 5). This makes the estimation of the corresponding BE and the accompanying composition uncertain. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of the spectra lead to a good fit with the experimental Vzp peak. The BE values reported in Table 5 concern vanadium oxygen bonds with a different ionic character. In the abundant literature concerning VPO catalysts, generally reported values for g2p3/2 BE are 518.2 and 517.1 eV for VOPO4 (V5+) and (VO)2PzO7, respectively [4,29,31-33]. The higher BE values ob- served at 517.9-518.0 eV correspond reasonably well to the VS+-O bond. While the 516.6-516.9 eV can be attributed to the V4 +-O bond.

It is known [34] that the different reactivities of olefins and paraffins onto VPO catalysts is related to the degree of the surface oxidation. Indeed dehydrogenated intermediates are the favoured products when the surface contains some amount of V 3 + ions. The production of butene and small amounts of furan is observed at low n-butane conversion with VCP catalysts. Trifiro et al. [17] show that when the surface is nearly completely reduced to VTM and V\"x, very low yields in MA are obtained. This reduced surface state is obtained during olefin oxidation to MA. Note that at high n-butane conversion, on VCP catalysts, the carbon balance shows that high quantities of products remain strongly adsorbed on the catalyst. This trend is confirmed by the presence of a peak at 289.8 eV in the VCP spectra which was reported by Sananes et al. [14] to be characteristic of N.H.

Then an amount of used V3+ could remain unreacted. In order to better approach the catalytic properties in butane oxidation of these doped catalysts, the acido-basic properties of the samples have been determined, and compared using the isopropyl alcohol (IPA) decomposition test through propene and acetone formation. The results are reported in Table 6. While intrinsic activities to propene formation are almost the same, the activities to acetone formation are larger for VCP catalysts than for VPO. Assuming that the dehydration is catalyzed by acidic sites and the dehydro- genation is catalysed both by acidic and basic sites [35-37], the activation of IPA involves different sites in VPO and VCP catalysts. 4. Discussion The aim of this report is to study the effects of chromium as dopant on the VPO catalyzed oxidation of n-butane to MA. Starting from a catalyst prepara- tion method already used by us [4] and using a P/V atomic ratio close to unity, doped catalysts were prepared, in aqueous medium. Cr dopant was added to the preparation procedure prior to the formation of the precursor. Because the beneficial effects are claimed when the dopant is added at a low level [20], the maximum Cr/V atomic ratio was maintained equal to 2.5%. The XRD spectra of both doped and undoped catalysts show that there is a marked change in the crystallization state. It is evident from the nature of XRD peaks that the VCP catalysts are amorphous comparatively to VPO. No peak is observed for any compound containing the dopant because of its presence at small amounts. The catalytic results obtained with VCP catalysts, show that the total oxida- tion to COx is drastically enhanced at high n-butane conversion. Parallel to the 358 N.H. Batis et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 decrease in the selectivity of MA, a strong increase in the selectivities of both carbon mono- and dioxides is found. Note that no butene and furan are observed at high n-butane conversion. However, these dehydrogenated compounds, when desorbed at low conversion, are detected early after the beginning of the reaction, while MA appears 16 h later. This result indicates that active sites in butene and furan formation are present on the surface of the Cr-doped catalysts, while those active in MA formation appear after surface rearrangement occur- ring in the reaction environment. The effect of temperature on the MA activity has been studied by conducting the reaction in the temperature range of 350-430. The doped catalysts produce MA with higher activation energies and CO2 with lower activation energies as compared to the undoped one. On the other hand, the VCP catalysts give lower selectivities toward MA at low and high conversion. A probable reason of this behavior is that the dopant favours the successive oxidation of MA to carbon oxides. Moreover, the increase of total oxidation at high butane conversion, while butene and furan are not produced, would be indicative that the dehydrogenated intermediate compounds, when desorbed in the gas phase, may also give rise to side reactions of the total oxidation to carbon oxides with a typical formation of CO products. The IPA decomposition to propene and acetone shows a marked change in the nature of the surface sites. While VCP catalysts are as active as VPO to propene formation, the former give higher intrinsic activities to acetone. Sed- lacek and Craus [38] have concluded from quantum-chemical calculations that the adsorption of an alcohol by means of a free electron pair of its oxygen on a electron deficient center (Lewis or Brt~nsted sites) leads to dehydration. This would indicate that Lewis and/or BriSnsted sites are present at the surface of VCP and VPO catalysts. However, the mechanism of dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols seems to proceed on metal-oxygen pairs. A survey of the literature [39-42] shows that many authors assumed that the dehydrogenation activity of chromium oxide depends on the presence of coordinatively unsatu- rated Cr3+ ions on the surface: two types of alcohol adsorption are possible, a non dissociative one on Cr3+ and a dissociative one on Cr3+-O2- pairs. All these findings lead to the conclusion that dehydrogenation of IPA in contact with VCP catalysts proceeds on surface Cr3+. A further support of this view is obtained by XPS results which show a surface Cr enrichment. According to kinetic scheme proposed in the literature [34], it is generally accepted that butane is initially dehydrogenated to butene and then oxidized to MA through butadiene and furan. Centi et al. [16] conclude that dehydrogena- tion of n-butane to butene requires a vIV-vm redox couple, whereas the subsequent oxidation of butene to MA requires a vV-vTM redox couple by comparing n-butane and 1-butene oxidation under oxygen limited conditions. Normally, these dehydrogenated intermediates are not observed for n-butane oxidation, but with regard to the mechanism oxidation, they are indicative of N.H. Batis et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 359 sequences which come prior to MA formation. It is tempting to conclude that the surface of Cr-doped catalysts, which combine sites selective for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation with a matrix selective for alkane oxidative conver- sion, is suitable to high MA selectivity. However, the catalytic results show a deleterious effect. It is well known that notwithstanding the reasonably easier activation of butene as compared to butane, the activity of the catalyst in butene oxidation gives mainly carbon oxides as products [43]. In addition, the cofeeding of even a small amount of butene together with n-butane strongly inhibits the selective behaviour of VPO catalysts [44,45]. This inhibition can be explained by the formation of strongly adsorbed species which favour the reduction of vanadium to the V~I~ state. This latter can be tentatively explained by its presence in the form of V(PO3)3 which seems to be inactive in the MA production [46]. The higher O/V ratio for VCP compared to VPO catalysts, as observed by XPS supports this view. The difference in catalytic performances between VPO and VCP catalysts can thus be reasonably explained on the basis of these considerations. The chromium sites on the surface of Cr-doped catalysts are active in butane dehydrogenation as well as the reduced vanadium sites. Part of these dehydrogenated products, which are weakly bonded adspecies, are removed in the gas phase at low butane conversion. Strongly held adspecies present on the surface during butane oxidation block the active sites and therefore inhibit oxygen adsorption. The activity of such surface to MA (Table 2) is very low comparatively to VPO catalysts. At high n-butane conversion, the surface concentration of adspecies is higher and their unselective reaction with gaseous oxygen to form COx is favoured. Since the formation of MA requires the presence of a limited amount of V v ions on a surface, formed by a vanadium(IV) phosphate, the reduction of vanadium ions to Vm state favours unselective oxidation. 5. Summary and conclusion From all these studies the following points are clear: (i) substantial differences exist between the catalytic performance of the undoped and Cr-doped catalysts with respect to changes in activity, selectivity and MA yield; (ii) the doped catalysts produce MA with higher activation energies as compared, to that for the undoped catalyst. But the unselective oxidation of butane occurs with lower activation energies for doped compared to undoped catalysts. (iii) the Cr-doped catalysts cannot withstand high temperature conditions without decrease in MA selectivity; (iv) the doped catalysts produce butene and furan at low conversion and CO at high (60%) conversion. These products are not observed with VPO catalyst. 360 N.H. Batis et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 347-361 These findings suggest that paraffin activation on Cr-doped catalysts involves different sites than V=O present on the VPO surface; (v) the characterization studies of both doped and undoped catalysts confirm that there is a marked change in the surface area and crystallization state. It is also evident from the XRD study that Cr addition enhances the amorphous state of VPO solids. Acknowledgements The authors thank the IRC/CNRS (France) for technical assistance. Dr. J.C.

Harrouch Batis H. Batis * A. Ghorbel Laboratoire de Chimie des Matériaux et Catalyse, Departement de Chimie, Faculte des Sciences de Tunis, 1060 Tunis, Tunisia * Corresponding author. In order to investigate the effect of additives on the active sites of VPO catalysts, chromium doped catalysts have been prepared in aqueous medium. The Cr/V atomic ratio was limited to 2.5%. XRD, IR, XPS, isopropyl alcohol decomposition and n-butane oxidation tests were used for a comparative study of the bulk and surface properties of the catalysts. XRD analysis reveals that (VO)2P2O7 and VOPO4 phases are poorly crystallized. The XPS results show a strong surface enrichment of chromium in Cr-doped materials which is deleterious for the production of maleic anhydride (MA). At high conversion, catalyst deactivation occurred by surface coking. Keywords VPO Butane oxidation Chromium Doping Maleic anhydride Selectivity References [1] Hodnett B.K. Catal. Rev. Sci.
