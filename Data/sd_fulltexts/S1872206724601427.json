(Y. Wang) Constructing well-defined interfaces in catalysts is a highly effective method to accelerate reactions with multiple intermediates. In this study, we developed a heterostructure catalyst combining fcc NiCu and hcp Ni3N, aiming at achieving superior performance in alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The NiCu/Ni3N not only overcomes the inadequate hydroxyl binding energy performance of NiCu alloys but also solves the problems of insufficient active sites found in most Ni/Ni3N. Experimental results and density functional theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of heterostructure significantly depends on the amount of Cu. This approach effectively prevents the side effects of increased catalyst particle size, typically resulting from the high temperatures and prolonged reaction times required for conventional synthesis of Ni/Ni3N. The interface of this heterostructure induces a distinctive overlapping effect that enhances the adsorption of water and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step. The NiCu/Ni3N catalyst shows an impressive activity of 71.8 mA mg−1 at an overpotential of 50 mV, a 14.7 times efficiency enhancement compared to pure Ni and comparable to that of low-loaded commercial Pt/C. This research highlights the potential of NiCu/Ni3N in advancing catalyst development. Graphical Abstract The NiCu/Ni₃N heterojunction catalyst enhances HOR under alkaline conditions by optimizing the interface structure, which optimizes hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption energies, thereby accelerating HOR kinetics. Keywords Hydrogen oxidation reaction Heterostructured electrocatalyst Non-precious metal catalyst Hydrogen adsorption energy Hydroxyl adsorption energy 1 Introduction Energy storage and conversion devices have emerged as key technologies for portable power, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage [1,2]. Conversion devices such as PEMFCs [3,4], water electrolyzers [5], and zinc-air batteries [6] offer high energy efficiency and sustainability, making them ideal for renewable energy integration. Among all energy storage and conversion devices, Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (AEMFCs) show great potential for transportation applications due to their potential to replace proton exchange membrane fuel cells at a lower cost [7]. To achieve high electrochemical performance in AEMFCs, non-PGM electrocatalysts are urgently needed, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline environments. Among all non-PGM HOR electrocatalysts, nickel-based materials are currently recognized as the most promising catalysts [8]. However, according to hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory, strong adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the surface of Ni seriously hinders the rate-determining Volmer step (Had + OH‒ → H2O + e‒), leading to a high activation energy for the HOR process [9]. To address this issue, various methods based on lowering the d-band center of Ni to weaken the adsorption ability of H* have been developed [10]. Compared to Ni, copper (Cu) with a relatively low d-band center has recently been chosen to alloy with Ni to achieve this goal, expecting an accelerated HOR process [11,12]. However, this modification not only weakens hydrogen adsorption but also reduces the adsorption of hydroxyl [13]. It is worth noting that hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) plays a critical role in the HOR process [14,15]. Research indicates that when hydrogen adsorption is relatively weak, enhancing the hydroxyl adsorption around the active sites can further boost the activity of HOR catalysts [16]. Constructing a NiCu alloy might not be sufficient to improve the HOR activity in Ni-based catalysts, and it is necessary to further optimize the hydroxyl adsorption [17]. Recently, Ni-based TMNs have been demonstrated to possess excellent capability for activating water molecules in the hydrogen evolution reaction owing to their Ni-N coordination structure with enhanced hydroxyl binding energy [18,19]. Thus, heterostructured Ni/Ni3N electrocatalysts have been constructed, leading to an optimized OHBE at the interface to significantly boost HOR kinetics [20,21]. Although studies have highlighted the optimized of HBE and OHBE in Ni/Ni₃N at certain adsorption sites, some sites (N sites) within Ni₃N exhibit poor HBE, which do not contribute effectively to hydrogen electrochemistry [22]. Except for the Ni/Ni₃N interface, there is a lack of sites with high activity for HOR, which may affect its catalytic efficiency, especially in the catalytic layer. Furthermore, it should be noted that in previous studies, to obtain these heterostructured Ni/Ni3N electrocatalysts, the majority of approaches require elevated reaction temperatures or prolonged reaction times [23–25]. These necessary synthesis conditions at high temperatures inevitably result in an increased catalyst size [13,26]. As a result, the inherent chemical inertness of Ni and Ni₃N with agglomerated morphology leads to a scarcity of active sites for electrochemical reactions [27,28]. It is therefore urgently desired to create more interfaces with an optimized structure of Ni and Ni₃N to realize efficient catalysis for HOR. Herein, we have successfully constructed NiCu/Ni₃N heterostructured catalysts by combining the synergistic advantages of NiCu and Ni₃N in optimizing HBE and OHBE to achieve high activity. Rather than by controlling the calcination condition, this structure is achieved by regulating the doped Cu content. It is found that excessive Cu in the lattice of Ni can hamper the formation of Ni₃N owing to the low binding energy of N atoms on Cu sites, indicating that Ni₃N can only form at the Ni-rich parts rather than where Cu atoms are present. Thus, an extraordinary NiCu/Ni₃N catalyst has been synthesized, featuring small Ni₃N particles decorating the NiCu alloy with an average particle size of around 5 nm. NiCu/Ni3N could not only provide the expected interface structure to optimize the OHBE catalytic activity but also possess exceptional HBE performance inherent to NiCu, finally exhibiting an excellent activity for HOR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of NiCu/Ni3N Ni(OH)₂@Cu precursor sheets were synthesized via a modified solvothermal method. Briefly, 1.5 mmol of Ni(NO₃)₂·6H₂O and 0.075 mmol of Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O were dissolved in 13 mL of NMP and 2 mL of deionized water, stirred for 30 min, and then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave for a solvothermal reaction at 180 °C for 16 h. The cooled precursors were vacuum-dried. To obtain NiCu/Ni₃N, 50 mg of the dried Ni(OH)₂@Cu precursors were thermally treated at 390 °C for 1 h under H₂/Ar and NH₃ flow with 10/90 and 45 mL min−1, respectively. The synthesis methods for other catalysts (Pure Ni, Ni3N and NiCu) are provided in the Supplementary Information (SI). 2.2 Characterization techniques X-ray diffractometer (XRD, CX-2700 equipment with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA) was used to identify the crystal structure of all samples. Transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV were used for morphology and structure analysis. Field scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7500F) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, GENESIS-2000XMS) was used to observe the morphology and element distribution of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an Escalab 250Xi instrument to characterize valence state and composition of surface elements in products. The Cu loadings were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Avio 200, America PE). The Ni X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement was performed at BL14WI station in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The electron storage ring of SSRF was operated at 3.5 Ge V, with a maximum current of 200 mA. XAFS data were collected using a fixed-exit Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. A Lytle detector was used to collect the fluorescence signal, and the energy was calibrated using Ni foil. As for the tests of in situ Raman, the working electrode utilized in this study was a glassy carbon electrode with a catalyst loading of 0.445 mgNi cm−2. A graphite rod served as the counter electrode, while a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was employed as the reference electrode. These components were used in conjunction with in situ Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra were obtained using a laser micro-Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser at an excitation power of 1 mW. The methods of other electrochemical characterization and theoretical calculation are provided in the SI. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 1(a) , the nitridation treatment on precursor without Cu doping leads to the generation of a pure-phase Ni3N material. If there were Cu atoms doped into precursor with the content varying from 1% to 10% (Fig. S1), a NiCu/Ni3N heterojunction could be aquired. The rietveld refinement method was further employed to quantitatively analyze the phase constituents of the NiCu/Ni3N heterostructures as illustrated in the Fig. S2. It reveals that this phase constituents is as a function of doped content of Cu. Specifically, increasing with Cu content, the weight percentage of Ni3N phase decreases from 54 wt% to 14 wt% while that of NiCu alloy increases from 46 wt% to 86 wt%. And the Ni (111) planes for NiCu/Ni3N heter-structured catalysts gradually shifts towards lower angles with the increase of Cu content, which is caused by the lattice expansion due to Cu doping, confirming the formation of NiCu alloy even after nitridation. However, when the Cu content in precursor reaches 15%, only NiCu alloys with fcc sturture has been observed in the XRD. In summary, Cu in the catalyts not only cause lattice expansion to form NiCu alloy but also modify the phase ratios, highlighting the importance of Cu concentration in defining the structural properties. The structure of pure Ni3N, NiCu/Ni3N heterostructure and pure Ni3N was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Figs. S3–S5 provide a comprehensive overview of the nanoparticles with their size distribution. As shown in Fig. S5, the average particle size of the Ni3N is 13.02 nm, whereas the average particle size of NiCu/Ni3N is 13.82 nm, demonstrating that the synthesis of the heterostructure material does not affect the change in particle size. As clearly displayed in high resolution HRTEM (Figs. 1(b) and (c)), the particle size of the NiCu particles is about 10 nm which is noticeably larger than that of the Ni3N particles (≍ 5 nm). This discrepancy in size may be attributed to incomplete nitridation due to Cu doping, resulting in smaller Ni3N particles. Notably, there is a distinct interfacial region between Ni₃N and NiCu (Fig. 1(c)). In this interfacial region, lattice distortion is prominently observed, indicating significant structural interaction and strain between the Ni₃N and NiCu phases. Studies have shown that controlled lattice distortion can beneficially impact activity by modifying the electronic structure of the material, suggesting that the lattice distortion at the NiCu/Ni₃N interface may also have a positive effect on HOR performance [29,30]. The interface structure of the NiCu/Ni3N were further observed in Figs. S6 and S7, which is totally different from the structure of pure hcp-Ni3N and fcc-Ni phases in Fig. S8. It is obviously that there are (002) plane of hcp-Ni3N with lattice distance of 2.26 Å and the (200) plane of fcc-Ni with the lattice distance of 1.92 Å, confirming there are two phases in the NiCu/Ni3N. The FFT patterns further corroborate this finding; the FFT of the Ni particle region (Fig. S6(b)) displays sharp diffraction spots characteristic of the Ni(200) planes, while the FFT of the Ni3N particle region (Fig. S6(c)) reveals diffraction spots corresponding to the Ni3N(002) planes. The juxtaposition of these two distinct crystallographic patterns within a single HRTEM image confirms the presence of a NiCu/Ni3N heterojunction. Since there is a clear structural dependency of catalysts on the concentration of Cu, DFT calculations have been conducted to uncover the underlying mechanisms for the formation of NiCu/Ni3N. As depicted in Fig. 1(d), the PDOS manifests the strong interaction between Cu and Ni d-bands, resulting in the d-orbitals of Ni shifting towards those of Cu. And the d-band center for Pure Ni, Ni47Cu1, and Ni41Cu7 is –1.27, –1.47, and –1.96 eV, respectively. Since the strength of Ni–N bonding and consequently the formation of Ni3N were be affected by the d band electronic structure, it could be deduced that with a higher content of Cu in NiCu alloy it may not easy to react with nitrogen atoms. Indeed, in Fig. S9, we observed that the adsorption energy of nitrogen on Ni48 is markedly stronger (0.135 eV) compared to that on Ni47Cu1 (0.628 eV) and Ni41Cu7 (0.694 eV). This suggests a preferential adsorption of nitrogen atoms around Ni, rather than near Cu, supporting the notion that presence of Cu diminishes affinity of nitrogen atoms for the Ni surface. Further the COHP analysis, depicted in Fig. 1(e), contrasts Ni48 with Ni47Cu1 in the presence of adsorbed nitrogen, highlighting the reduced strength of the Cu–N bond due to Cu-induced electronic structure change as well. Moreover, we calculated the transition state energies (Fig. 1(f)) for nitrogen incorporation into the metallic layers of Ni48 and Ni41Cu7. It is found that the adsorption energy barrier for Ni47Cu1 is significantly higher at 5.252 eV, compared to that for Ni48 at 2.985 eV. During the nitridation, the sample is reduced to a NiCu alloy, and the presence of Cu leads to incomplete nitridation. This results in the segregation of Ni3N, forming an NiCu/Ni3N, as shown in Fig. S10. Modifications in the structure of the material substantially affect its electronic configuration. As depicted in Fig. 2(a) , the high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum shows that there is a negative shift of 0.24 eV to a lower binding energy for NiCu relative to Pure Ni (Fig. 2(a)). This shift indicates an electron transfer from Cu to Ni, aligning with the Bader charge analysis and differential charge density results presented in Fig. S11. In contrast, the Ni 2p XPS spectra of NiCu/Ni3N exhibits a positive shift to a higher binding energy compared to NiCu. Simultaneously, a similar positive shift has been detected in the Cu 2p spectra of NiCu/Ni3N, indicating that the formation of the heterostructure creates an electron-rich interface where NiCu alloy may donate electrons (Fig. 2(b)) [31,32]. In the high-resolution N 1s (Fig. 2(c)) XPS spectrum of the NiCu/Ni3N heterostructure, the distinct peak at 397.8 eV is indicative of Ni–N bond. The peaks at 399.2 eV can be attributed to N vacancies at the interface due to the presence of Cu [33]. Fig. 2(d) presents the Ni K-edge XANES spectra for NiCu/Ni3N. The valence state of Ni atoms lies between Ni0 and Ni2+, and is closer to Ni0. This indicates that Ni retains metallic properties but it has partially lost electrons. The local structure around Ni atoms was further elucidated using Fourier-transformed, k-weighted EXAFS spectra in the R space. In Fig. 2(e), an obvious peak is observed near 2.6 Å indicates the presence of typical Ni–Ni bonds [34]. Compared to Ni foil, the Ni–Ni bond of NiCu/Ni3N length is slightly increased, likely due to lattice expansion caused by Cu doping. In addition to Ni–Ni bonds, a characteristic peak near 1.9 Å is also observed, which is attributed to Ni–N bonding [35], confirming the presence of Ni3N. Detailed chemical insights are derived from the EXAFS fitting (Fig. 2(f), Fig. S12 and Table S1). In Table S1, Ni–Ni bond at 2.67 Å with a coordination number of 7.36 indicates that the coordination environment of Ni atoms is predominantly composed of other Ni atoms. While Ni–Cu bond measured at 2.92 Å with a much lower coordination number of 1.14, suggesting Cu is present in trace amounts in NiCu alloy. Besides Ni–metal bonds, the distance for Ni–N bond is found to be 1.92 Å with a coordination number of 1.25, confirming the presence of Ni3N. Employing wavelet transform (WT) analysis, we had a multi-dimensional insight into the local electronic and structural configuration of the catalyst. In Fig. 2(g), the distinct intensity peak observed for NiCu/Ni3N at (13 Å−1, 1.92 Å) sharply contrasts with the peaks of bulk Ni (Fig. 2(h)) and Ni oxide (Fig. 2(i)), serving as a definitive signal of the presence of Ni–N bonds. Additionally, the peak corresponding to Ni-metal interactions (7.5 Å−1, 2.67 Å) closely mirrors that observed in pure Ni, suggesting a slight extension in the bond length. In summary, Cu doping facilitates electron transfer from Cu to Ni, increasing the electron density with Ni of NiCu alloys. The Ni3N with NiCu alloy both Ni and Cu would lose electrons, indicating that there is charge transfer at the interface from NiCu alloy to Ni3N. To further elucidate the HOR performance of our NiCu/Ni3N catalysts, we employed rotating disk electrode (RDE) analysis. The results of comparing commercial Pt/C, Ni3N, NiCu, Ni3N, and Pure Ni are illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S13. The results of LSV indicate that NiCu/Ni3N manifests markedly higher current densities (Fig. 3(a)) in contrast to the comparative samples. The superior HOR performance of NiCu/Ni₃N is a result of its carefully optimized Cu content and the resulting structural properties. The NiCu/Ni3N attained a current density of 2.31 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 50 mV, which notably surpasses the 1.08 mA cm−2 exhibited by pure Ni even bears comparison with that of low-loading commercial Pt/C catalysts. The exchange current density (J 0) normalized to the electrochemical active surface area was further extrapolated from linear fits of the micro-polarization domain to compare its inherent activity (as depicted in Figs. 3(b) and (c)). The NiCu/Ni3N shows largest electrochemical active surface area among all samples (Fig. S14). Table S2 summarizes the R s and R ct of NiCu/Ni3N and Pt/C, respectively. The results demonstrate that the NiCu/Ni3N catalyst exhibits smaller R ct comparable to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, highlighting its better electrochemical kinetics (Fig. S15). The NiCu/Ni3N catalyst exhibited a specific surface activity of 0.066 mA cm−2, which is almost 6 times to that observed for Pure Ni, demonstrating an intrinsic enhancement of HOR activity for NiCu/Ni3N catalyst. Mass activity (J km) was further obtained through analysis of polarization curves across a spectrum of rotational speeds spanning from 400 to 2500 r min−1 for NiCu/Ni3N, delineated in Fig. 3(d). The NiCu/Ni3N possesses a mass activity of 71.8 mA mg−1 at an overpotential of 50 mV, which represents a remarkable 14.7-fold enhancement over the baseline established by pure Ni. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the pure Ni and NiCu alloy exhibit similar hydroxyl binding energies at around 0.261 V, indicating that trace doping with Cu does not alter the hydroxyl adsorption energy. In contrast, the NiCu/Ni3N exhibits an improved hydroxyl binding energy at 0.204 V [17]. This improvement in the NiCu/Ni3N can be attributed to the enhanced oxygen affinity [36]. And the enhanced oxygen affinity significantly boosts the HOR. Beyond mass activity and exchange current density, the cycle stability of a catalyst is equally crucial. The NiCu/Ni3N catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability as HOR activity remained nearly unchanged even after 1000 CV cycles (Fig. 3(f)). As shown in Fig. S16, the results of chronoamperometry demonstrates that after 100 hours, the NiCu/Ni3N maintains 73.82% of its initial current density. The XRD, XPS, SEM, and HRTEM analyses of the catalyst after the catalytic HOR activity tests, as shown in Figs. S17–S20, indicate no significant structural changes post-cycling, demonstrating its structural stability. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S21, in situ Raman result reveals a distinct Ni-OH peak at 475 cm−1 appearing at 0.4 V and increasing with voltage, indicating the transformation of Ni into β-Ni(OH)₂ [37]. In contrast, the absence of a Cu-OH peak at 290 cm−1 indicates that Cu remains stable during HOR, helping to maintain the high activity and durability of the NiCu/Ni₃N [38]. As shown in Table S3, the NiCu/Ni3N catalyst exhibits superior HOR performance compared to various other HOR catalysts. To meet the requirements for operation under extreme conditions, we also tested the resistance to CO and methanol poisoning, both of which showed better anti-poisoning performance than Pt/C (Fig. S22). Expanding upon the improved HOR kinetics observed in electrochemical tests, we constructed the model of NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002). Two sites have been chosen to investigate the role of NiCu/Ni3N heterostructure interface in the HOR activity (Fig. 4(a) ). Owing to the conducive orbital hybridization among Ni 3d, Cu 3d, and N 2p orbitals at NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) heterostructure, there is a marked downward shift of the d-band center for neighboring Ni atoms to –1.45 and –1.53 eV compared to that for pure Ni48 (Fig. 4(b)). Consequently, the reduced ΔG M*H on these two sites has been observed with values of –0.185 and –0.149 eV respectively, compared to that on other sites in Fig. 4(c) and Table S4, indicating NiCu site is the most favorable for the HOR process (Fig. S23). This further substantiates that the unique electronic and geometric structure of the NiCu/Ni3N interfacial sites provides favorable conditions for hydrogen adsorption [22]. Furthermore, electron density accumulated at the NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) heterointerface is observed in Fig. 4(d), which is in concordance with XPS and EXAFS results. This electron enrichment causes an escalated valence electron density, enhancing the adsorptive energies for water [35]. Additionally, to predict the adsorption strength of H2O, we compared the Ni–O bonds in both pure Ni and NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) via COHP analysis. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the results indicate that the antibonding states for the Ni–O bond in NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) are significantly lower than in pure Ni, suggesting a more stable bond in the NiCu/Ni3N structure. We also compared the adsorption energies of hydroxyl binding energy on both sides of the heterostructure and found that the Ni₃N side exhibits more favorable adsorption properties, further supporting the enhanced performance of the NiCu/Ni₃N interface (Fig. S24 and Table S5). Further, we identify the water formation step as the potential-determining step to calculate an activation energy (Fig. 4(f) and Fig. S25). It is found that the activation energy for the site on NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) is 1.178 eV, which is markedly lower than that on Pure Ni (1.337 eV). Therefore, the advanced HOR performance of the NiCu/Ni3N can be attributed to the reduced adsorption of H* along with an increased adsorption of OH* owing to the optimized interface structure. This highlights the critical role of both hydrogen and hydroxide binding energies in improving the efficiency of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reactions. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have developed a highly efficient heterostructured electrocatalyst, comprising NiCu and Ni3N particles, for the alkaline HOR. Both experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the formation of the heterostructure is closely linked to the concentration of Cu. The distinctive interface of this heterostructure markedly lowers the energy barrier for the potential-determining step of HOR, thus facilitating the acceleration of water formation during HOR. The optimally engineered NiCu(111)/Ni3N(002) demonstrates exceptional HOR catalytic efficiency, achieving a mass activity of 71.8 mA g−1 with almost no activity decay even after 1000 cycles of CV tests. This research lays the groundwork for developing high-performance heterostructured catalysts with an expanded range of interface chemistries for various applications.

        "dc:description": "Constructing well-defined interfaces in catalysts is a highly effective method to accelerate reactions with multiple intermediates. In this study, we developed a heterostructure catalyst combining fcc NiCu and hcp Ni3N, aiming at achieving superior performance in alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The NiCu/Ni3N not only overcomes the inadequate hydroxyl binding energy performance of NiCu alloys but also solves the problems of insufficient active sites found in most Ni/Ni3N. Experimental results and density functional theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of heterostructure significantly depends on the amount of Cu. This approach effectively prevents the side effects of increased catalyst particle size, typically resulting from the high temperatures and prolonged reaction times required for conventional synthesis of Ni/Ni3N. The interface of this heterostructure induces a distinctive overlapping effect that enhances the adsorption of water and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step. The NiCu/Ni3N catalyst shows an impressive activity of 71.8 mA mg−1 at an overpotential of 50 mV, a 14.7 times efficiency enhancement compared to pure Ni and comparable to that of low-loaded commercial Pt/C. This research highlights the potential of NiCu/Ni3N in advancing catalyst development.",
