Polyethers as potential electron donors for Ziegler–Natta ethylene polymerization catalysts Sami Pirinen Tuula T. Pakkanen ⁎ Department of Chemistry, University of Eastern Finland, P.O. Box 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland Department of Chemistry University of Eastern Finland P.O. Box 111 Joensuu FI-80101 Finland ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +358 50 4354379. Graphical abstract Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) were studied as possible electron donors for heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalysts employed for ethylene polymerization. Two synthetic routes were applied for the preparation of the catalysts by mixing the polyether and TiCl4 with δ-MgCl2 support in the same step or at different stages of the catalyst synthesis. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies revealed a clear interaction between PEG and δ-MgCl2 inducing changes in the chain conformation of the polyether. If PEG was added at the same stage with TiCl4, a yellow PEG/TiCl4 complex was formed and the activity of the catalyst was decreased. A partial decomposition of PTHF to tetrahydrofuran (THF) in contact with δ-MgCl2 was evidenced from the FT-IR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. The decomposition could be induced by the Lewis acid sites or by possible organomagnesium compounds present in the synthesized δ-MgCl2. However, the decomposition did not have a negative effect on the polymerization behavior of the prepared catalysts, when compared to the reference catalysts where THF was initially used as a donor. The catalysts prepared with polyethers as electron donor showed good activity in ethylene (around 1000kgP/molTi h) and in ethylene/1-hexene (around 1600kgP/molTi h) polymerizations. Keywords Poly(ethylene glycol) Poly(tetrahydrofuran) Electron donors Ziegler–Natta catalyst Polymerization 1 Introduction Since their discovery in the 1950’s, heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalysts have been under a constant research and development, which has led to catalysts widely employed today in olefin polymerization [1,2]. The first two generations of the Ziegler–Natta catalysts were comprised of TiCl3 activated by AlEt2Cl [3]. Many of today’s catalysts are based on the third generation of the Ziegler–Natta catalysts, which consist of TiCl4 supported on activated MgCl2 (δ-MgCl2) with electron donors (e.g., ethyl benzoate) modifying the active sites and with aluminum alkyls as cocatalysts [4–7]. The next breakthroughs have been largely related to finding suitable electron donors that enhance the activity and the stereospecificity of the catalyst even further. Examples from such donors are alkylphthalates of the fourth [8,9] and 1,3-diethers of the fifth [10,11] generation catalysts. These donors are called internal electron donors, which are added during the catalyst preparation the stereoselectivity of the catalyst [12]. As for external electron donors such as alkoxysilanes (used with alkylphthalates), they are added during activation of the catalyst with the aluminum alkyl cocatalyst [12]. Even though highly active and stereospecific catalysts are obtained with these electron donors, the search for new ones has continued as electron donors can produce new type of catalysts and hence affect polymer properties. For example, the use of succinate as a donor gives polypropylene with a broad molar mass distribution [13]. A suitable structurally disordered δ-MgCl2 support for the catalyst can be obtained by ball milling of α-MgCl2 [14]. However, even higher structural disorder can be achieved by dissolving α-MgCl2 in a suitable electron donor and then removing the coordinated donor or by synthesizing δ-MgCl2 from Mg metal and an alkyl chloride [15]. The structure of the support can be further tailored by the interaction of MgCl2 with an electron donor. The existence of polymeric chains of MgCl2/electron donor adducts and their importance in catalyst formation has been reported in several studies [16–18]. In addition, these studies show that the donor content of the adducts is decreased when they are contacted with TiCl4 and that the activity of the catalysts depends on the content of an electron donor. Ethers are an important type of electron donors in Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is often used for ethylene polymerization catalysts [19–21]. For propylene polymerization, 1,3-diethers have gathered much interest as their use in catalysts gives a narrow molar mass distribution and a good hydrogen response [22,23]. Not much attention has been paid to polyether donors. A step towards these types of donors has been a study, which showed that the use of triethers increased stereoregularity and molar mass distribution of polypropylene [24]. There has been to our knowledge only one study related to polyethers in the Ziegler–Natta catalysts, in which poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with a molar mass 200g/mol (∼4 repeating units) was used as a solvent to activate MgCl2 [25]. In relation to the catalyst support, the interactions of MgCl2 with PEG have been widely studied in the field of electrolytes [26–28]. An advantage of polyethers is that they are relatively harmless – in particular PEG used in many pharmaceuticals – increasing their potential as possible electron donors for the Ziegler–Natta catalysts. In this study, we examined the use of PEG and poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) as electron donors for Ziegler–Natta catalysts. The activated MgCl2 was synthesized by using a reaction of Mg with 1-chlorobutane first presented by Di Noto and coworkers [15,29] The interaction of the polyethers with δ-MgCl2 support and with the titanium tetrachloride in the catalysts was studied with infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Performance of the prepared catalysts was evaluated on the basis of the catalyst activity and polymer properties in polymerization of ethylene and in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Magnesium (Acros Organics) was dried in an oven at 110°C overnight and iodine (Merck) was used as received. Octane, 1-chlorobutane, THF, and anhydrous toluene were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and dried with 3Å molecular sieves. PTHF with an average molar mass 1400g/mol and PEG with an average molar mass 1000g/mol were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and dried under vacuum at 130°C overnight. TiCl4 (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as received. Ethylene gas (3.5 grade, Linde Gas) used in the polymerizations was passed through moisture and oxygen traps. 1-Hexene (Sigma–Aldrich) was distilled over sodium flakes and further dried with 3Å molecular sieves. 2.2 Synthesis of supports and catalysts All syntheses and characterizations of the supports and the catalysts were performed under an inert gas unless otherwise mentioned. δ-MgCl2 was synthesized according to a method previously described by Di Noto et al., with slight modifications [15]. An autoclave was packed with Mg (0.5g, 21mmol), few small crystals of iodine, octane (20ml), and 1-chlorobutane (6.5ml, 62mmol) and heated at130°C for 2h. The resulting δ-MgCl2 was washed with octane. The synthesis was continued by mixing δ-MgCl2 with polyether (5.1mmol of repeating units) dissolved in toluene (20ml). The mixture was heated in an autoclave at 90°C for 1h after which the solid product was washed with toluene and octane and dried under vacuum (Sup-donor in Table 1 ). Two preparation methods were employed to synthesize the catalysts (Scheme 1 ). In the first one (Cat–donor-A in Table 1), the catalysts were prepared by mixing the obtained MgCl2/polyether supports with TiCl4 (10ml) in octane solvent and heating the mixture in an autoclave at 90°C for 2h. In the second preparation method (Cat–donor-B), the catalysts were synthesized by mixing δ-MgCl2 simultaneously with polyether (5.1mmol of repeating units) and TiCl4 (10ml) in toluene solvent and by heating the mixture in an autoclave at 90°C for 2h. The obtained catalysts were washed with toluene and octane and dried under vacuum. Reference catalysts were prepared in the same manner without an electron donor (Cat–0) and with THF as a donor. 2.3 Polymerizations For ethylene polymerizations an autoclave was packed with 10–30mg of catalyst, 50ml heptane, and triethyl aluminum (molar ratio Al/Ti=100). The autoclave was kept 15min at the desired reaction temperature before starting the ethylene feed (2bar). The pressure and temperature were kept constant during the polymerization. After 60min from starting the ethylene feed the reaction was stopped by venting off the ethylene gas and by adding acidic ethanol. The polymer was washed with ethanol and dried at 60°C. In the case of ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, the comonomer (2ml) was added by a needle technique under nitrogen flow through the secondary valve of the autoclave just before starting the ethylene feed. 2.4 Characterization Magnesium was determined by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, chlorine by Mohr titration, titanium by spectrophotometric method, and carbon and hydrogen by elemental analyzer (Table S1, Supplementary data). The amount of oxygen was calculated based on the amount of the other elements. FT-IR transmission spectra of the supports and the catalysts were measured with a Bruker Vertex 70 instrument with a resolution of 2cm−1 using 32 scans and a Blackman–Harris 3-Term apodization function. Samples were ground with Nujol to make a mull and measured between KBr discs. For qualitative characterization of the water-soluble compounds present in the samples, 1H NMR spectra of samples dissolved in D2O with sodium acetate as an internal standard were measured with a Bruker Avance-400 NMR spectrometer with 32 scans and a relaxation delay of 10s. PXRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance instrument with a step size of 0.05° and a time per step of 8s. Samples were placed on a special steel-made sample holder and covered with a Mylar film to prevent exposure with air. SEM images were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 microscope with a voltage of 3kV. The samples were quickly fixed on a tape and immediately moved to the loading chamber of SEM. Crystallinity and melting point of the polymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements performed with a Mettler Toledo DSC823e instrument. The thermal history of the samples was removed by heating the samples from 25°C to 170°C and by cooling to 25°C with a rate of 10°C/min. The second heating from 25°C to 170°C with the 10°C/min heating rate was used for the analysis of the polymers. To determine the comonomer content of the polymers, FT-IR transmission spectrum with a resolution of 4cm−1 was recorded from a thin film. The comonomer content was estimated from the ratio between the areas of the absorbances at 1460cm−1 (CH2 deformation) and 1378cm−1 (CH3 deformation). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Composition of supports and catalysts Supports and catalysts having polyether as an internal electron donor were prepared. As a starting point for all samples, a reaction presented by Di Noto et al. [15] was utilized to synthesize δ-MgCl2 with a disordered structure exposing unsaturated lateral surfaces for electron donors and TiCl4 to bind to. Compositions of the samples are presented in Table 1. The weight percentages of the supports indicate that most of the added donor is present in the sample. THF is a monodentate ligand and hence it is probable that all the THF molecules are bound to Mg. On the other hand, PEG (∼22 repeating units) is a polydentate ligand and it is probable that only part of the oxygen atoms in one PEG molecule are bound to Mg atoms due to the steric effects caused by the short spacing between the adjacent ether oxygen atoms in a PEG molecule. For PTHF (∼19 repeating units) having longer spacing between ether oxygen atoms, a less steric hindrance could be expected. By contacting the supports with TiCl4, a clear decrease in the donor/Mg molar ratio is observed when the donor molecule used is THF or PTHF, whereas even an increase in the molar ratio is observed in the samples where PEG is used as a donor. The decrease in the molar ratio with THF and PTHF donors can be explained by the formation of soluble TiCl4/donor complexes [16,30], which could have been removed during the washing of the catalyst samples. On the other hand, based on the unchanged donor/Mg molar ratio of Cat–PEG-A and on the increasing molar ratio of Cat–PEG-B, it seems that removal of the PEG donor by TiCl4 is not taking place. In addition, Cat–PEG-B has a high Ti/Mg molar ratio as compared to the other samples. This can be explained by the formation of insoluble PEG/TiCl4 complex (for details see Supplementary data), which is not removed during the washing of the catalyst samples. A similar type of complex has been reported between PEG and titanium compound [31]. 3.2 Bonding of donors and decomposition of PTHF Interaction of the donor molecules with δ-MgCl2 was studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. Previous studies reporting properties of complexes between PEG and metal salts [28,32] indicate that FT-IR vibrational bands at 800–1200cm−1 are suitable for studying the interactions of PEG with metal cation. The FT-IR spectrum of pure PEG in Fig. 1 a shows CH2 rocking vibrations at 843, 949, and 965cm−1. In the FT-IR spectrum of Sup-PEG the band at 843cm−1 is nearly absent and the other two CH2 rocking vibrations have decreased in intensity. These changes clearly show that the conformation of the PEG chain is affected when brought in contact with δ-MgCl2. A similar result has been observed with PEG/MgCl2 complexes before [28]. Furthermore, the shift of the ν(COC) band maximum of PEG from 1117cm−1 (comprised from a group of absorption bands [32]) to a lower wavenumber at 1082cm−1, as observed for Sup-PEG in Fig. 1a, indicates the bonding of PEG to Mg atoms through ether oxygen atoms. The addition of TiCl4 does not bring any significant changes to these vibrations as can be observed from the FT-IR spectrum of Cat–PEG-A. On the other hand, in Cat–PEG-B, where PEG and TiCl4 were added at the same stage, the bonding of PEG is changed due to the formation of PEG/TiCl4 complex as described in the Section 3.1. This can be observed by comparing the FT-IR spectra of Cat–PEG-B and PEG/TiCl4 complex, which both show ν(COC) band maximum around 1065cm−1. The FT-IR spectra of PTHF (Fig. 1b) and THF (Fig. 1c) in the region 800–1200cm−1 are much simpler than for PEG. The ν(COC) of PTHF seems to have a large red shift from 1117cm−1 of neat PTHF to 1024cm−1 for Sup-PTHF (Fig. 1b). In addition, a strong absorbance appeared at 880cm−1 for Sup-PTHF that was not presence in the FT-IR spectrum of PTHF. A comparison of the FT-IR spectra of Sup-PTHF and Sup-THF (Fig. 1b and c) reveals a great resemblance of these spectra. This resemblance suggests that the bands at 1024cm−1 and 880cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of Sup-PTHF are not absorbances from PTHF, but instead, can be assigned to ν as and ν s(COC) of THF. Therefore, the FT-IR results suggest that PTHF decomposes to THF in the synthesis of the support. The presence of THF in Sup-PTHF was confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. 2 ). The signals for THF are observed at 1.87ppm (CH2 CO) and 3.73ppm (CH2 O). Although PTHF is only slightly soluble in D2O, the signals at 1.61ppm (CH2 CO) and 3.53ppm (CH2 O) are also observed in the NMR spectrum of Sup-PTHF indicating that PTHF is not fully decomposed. Similar decomposition of PTHF was observed for Cat–PTHF-A and B (Figure S1, Supplementary data). On the contrary, no decomposition of PEG was observed in the syntheses of support and catalysts. The decomposition of PTHF proceeds presumably by ether cleavage. A previous study [33] reports that under nitrogen the temperature required to decompose PTHF is 170°C or higher and the heating produces butane, butanal, THF, and dibutyl ether as the main products due to the ether cleavage. Although our experiments were conducted clearly at a lower temperature (90°C), the stability of PTHF was tested in our reaction conditions by heating it in a toluene solvent at 90°C for 1h. No aldehyde or ether compounds were detected after the heating (Figure S2, Supplementary data) suggesting that MgCl2 plays a role in the decomposition of PTHF. To study further the decomposition, a commercial anhydrous α-MgCl2 was heated with PTHF in toluene at 90°C for 1h. PTHF did not decompose with α-MgCl2 (Figure S3, Supplementary data), which suggests that the presence of δ-MgCl2 is required for the decomposition process. Compared to α-MgCl2, δ-MgCl2 forms smaller crystallites and thus has a relatively larger number of Lewis acidic [34] surfaces such as (104) and (110) planes having five and four coordinated Mg atoms along with a high surface area. These Mg sites on the coordinatively unsatured surfaces can possibly promote the decomposition of PTHF. This is supported by the fact that zeolites and mixtures of metal oxides have been used to catalyze the decomposition of PTHF–THF [35]. Furthermore, in our case the Grignard reactions [36] taking place in the synthesis of δ-MgCl2 may lead to the presence of tiny amounts of organomagnesium compounds that may also take part in the decomposition process. 3.3 Structure and morphology of supports and catalysts The structural features of the supports and catalyst were studied by PXRD analysis (Fig. 3 ). Sup-PTHF and Sup-THF give broad reflections at 12–16°, 27–37°, and 48–54° 2θ, typical to MgCl2 with a disordered structure i.e., δ-MgCl2 [14]. In addition, reflections at 6.6° and 10.1° 2θ are observed for these supports suggesting the presence of MgCl2 polymeric chains as has been reported in the literature [16]. As pointed out earlier, PTHF decomposes to THF and thus the PXRD patterns of Sup-PTHF and Sup-THF are highly similar. The reflections at 6.6° and 10.1° 2θ disappear when the supports are treated with TiCl4 leading to Cat–PTHF-A and Cat–THF-A having only reflections typical of disordered MgCl2. This structural change is probably due to the decreasing donor content, which can be attributed to TiCl4 removing part of the donor molecules. The structure of δ-MgCl2 was not affected by the interaction with PEG. All of the catalysts prepared had a similar δ-MgCl2 support structure (see also Figure S4, Supplementary data). According to SEM analysis, the morphology of δ-MgCl2 is influenced by interaction with PTHF and THF (Fig. 4 ). Sup-PTHF and Sup-THF have a network structure formed from nanofibers that are less than 100nm in width. A similar morphology has been observed in a previous study [37] for MgCl2/THF complexes and the network type structure was proposed to be an intermediate between amorphous and crystalline MgCl2/THF complexes. The network structure of Sup-PTHF and Sup-THF was destroyed in this work on addition of TiCl4 and the morphology of the catalysts was now similar to δ-MgCl2 (Figure S5, Supplementary data). Sup-PEG did not have a network-type structure and on the basis of the SEM image (Fig. 4) the morphology was similar to plain δ-MgCl2. 3.4 Polymerizations The prepared catalysts showed a good activity in homo- and copolymerization. Homopolymerization of ethylene was performed at 80°C and 50°C. The results in Fig. 5 (numerical data in Table S2, Supplementary data) show that with all catalysts the activity is 1.5–3 times higher at a polymerization temperature of 50°C. A similar effect of the temperature on ethylene polymerization has been observed previously [38]. A decrease in the activities with increasing temperature can be due to the decreasing stability of the catalysts or due the decreasing solubility of the monomer into the polymerization solvent [39,40]. Clearly the highest activity in homopolymerization was achieved with Cat–THF-B (4230kgP/molTi h at 50°C), whereas Cat–PEG-B had explicitly the lowest activity (226kgP/molTi h at 50°C). An explanation for the high (titanium based) activity of Cat–THF-B could be in the low titanium content (0.35wt%), which can increase the relative number of active titanium centers in the catalyst as it has been concluded in a previous study [41]. The low activity for Cat–PEG-B comes as a result of the formation of PEG/TiCl4 complex, which also accounts for the high titanium content (5.34wt%) of Cat–PEG-B. The activities of the other catalysts were in the range 800–1200kgP/molTi h in ethylene polymerizations performed at 50°C. When comparing to the reference catalyst Cat–0, the activities of Cat-PTHF-A and B were lower, but the activity of Cat–PEG-A was comparable to the activity of Cat–0. The activities in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene performed at 50°C are significantly higher than in the homopolymerization. This phenomena known as the comonomer effect [42,43] is most pronounced with catalysts Cat–PTHF-A and B and Cat–PEG-A, which had 1.5–2 times higher activity in copolymerization. Although, Cat–THF-B had still the highest activity, the introduction of the comonomer brought about only a slight increase in the activity. In the case of Cat–PTHF-A and B the preparation method did not affect the activity. With Cat–PEG-A and B a clear difference in the activities was observed due to the presence of a PEG/TiCl4 complex in Cat–PEG-B. On the other hand, the addition of THF and TiCl4 simultaneously resulted as low titanium content in Cat–THF-B giving a high activity. The homopolymerization temperature had a clear effect on the crystallinity of the polymers produced by the catalysts. The analytical data in Table 2 indicates a clear decrease by about 10% in crystallinity with a decrease in the homopolymerization temperature from 80°C to 50°C. Similar trend has been observed previously [38]. The lower crystallinity of the homopolymers produced at 50°C could lead to easier monomer diffusion to the active sites, and hence to an increase in the activity of the catalyst. The polymerization temperature did not have a clear effect on the melting point of the homopolymers. The introduction of 1-hexene comonomer increases short chain branching in the copolymers and leads to a decrease in crystallinity compared to that of homopolymers. The catalysts Cat–THF-A and B and Cat–PTHF-B produced copolymers with the highest comonomer contents and as consequence copolymers with the lowest crystallinity. Other catalysts (including Cat–0 without an electron donor) produced copolymers with a slightly lower comonomer content and higher crystallinity. The similarity of the polymers produced with Cat–0 and catalysts Cat–PTHF-A and Cat–PEG-A and B suggests that the donors might have no direct interaction with the active titanium sites. Although PEG/TiCl4 complex is present in Cat–PEG-B, the copolymer produced by the catalyst is similar to the one obtained with Cat–PEG-A indicating that the PEG/TiCl4 complex is not likely taking place in the copolymerization and its effect is only seen in lowering the titanium based activity of the catalyst. 4 Conclusions Polyethers, PEG and PTHF, were introduced as electron donors in titanium based Ziegler–Natta catalysts supported on δ-MgCl2. The synthesis procedure for applying the polyethers as electron donors in the catalysts was found to be a very important factor. When PEG and TiCl4 were added at the same stage, a PEG/TiCl4 complex was formed, decreasing the activity of the catalyst. The formation of this complex can be prevented or hindered by fixing PEG on δ-MgCl2 prior to the addition of TiCl4. As for PTHF, it was found to partially decompose to THF in contact with the δ-MgCl2 synthesized in this work. The decomposition of PTHF was attributed to the Lewis acidic nature of the lateral surfaces in the δ-MgCl2 and to possible presence of organomagnesium compounds in the δ-MgCl2. The catalysts prepared in this work showed good activity and comonomer response in the polymerizations suggesting the polyethers are potential electron donors for Ziegler–Natta catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) were studied as possible electron donors for heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalysts employed for ethylene polymerization. Two synthetic routes were applied for the preparation of the catalysts by mixing the polyether and TiCl4 with δ-MgCl2 support in the same step or at different stages of the catalyst synthesis. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies revealed a clear interaction between PEG and δ-MgCl2 inducing changes in the chain conformation of the polyether. If PEG was added at the same stage with TiCl4, a yellow PEG/TiCl4 complex was formed and the activity of the catalyst was decreased. A partial decomposition of PTHF to tetrahydrofuran (THF) in contact with δ-MgCl2 was evidenced from the FT-IR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. The decomposition could be induced by the Lewis acid sites or by possible organomagnesium compounds present in the synthesized δ-MgCl2. However, the decomposition did not have a negative effect on the polymerization behavior of the prepared catalysts, when compared to the reference catalysts where THF was initially used as a donor. The catalysts prepared with polyethers as electron donor showed good activity in ethylene (around 1000kgP/molTi h) and in ethylene/1-hexene (around 1600kgP/molTi h) polymerizations.",
