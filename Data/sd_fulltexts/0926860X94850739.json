In general, conversion and selectivity were strongly influenced by pretreatment conditions (temperature, nature of atmosphere). A restructuring of the catalysts was observed during o-xylene oxidation, resulting in higher V/Ti surface ratios, without changing crystallinity or crystal size. Acid-base properties of the catalysts were characterised by ammonia adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption, combined with FT-IR and mass spectroscopic analysis. At temperatures higher than 370, good correlation was observed between the strength of acid sites (K<Ba~-Bi< unpromoted = W = Sn) and phthalic anhydride yield (K < Ba < Bi < unpromoted = W = Sn). At low conversion and temperature only basic promoters had a positive influence. Redox properties were studied by TPR and XPS analysis. The oxidation state of vanadium was + 5 before and after reaction and it was independent of promotion. SnO2 and Bi203 improved the reducibility of vanadia by hydrogen, but no general correlation could be observed between redox properties and catalytic features.

Introduction Vanadia/titania catalysts are widely used in selective oxidation reactions, including the *Corresponding author. SSDI O926-860X ( 93 ) E0238-8 242 M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241 260 transformation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [ 1,2]. Many attempts have been made to correlate the physico-chemical characteristics of vanadia and vanadia/titania based catalysts and their catalytic features in oxidation reactions. However, the lack of in-situ techniques and the considerable deviation between the conditions of catalytic reactions and those used in characterisation methods makes interpretations subject to dispute. The superior behaviour of anatase-supported vanadia catalysts as compared to other systems is attributed to the formation of a highly disperse, amorphous vanadia layer on the anatase surface [ 3 ]. Formation and real structure of these species are still under discussion [4-6]. Several elements in the form of oxides or salts have been suggested as promoters for the vanadia/titania catalysts (ref. [2] and references therein). Their amount is usually around 1 wt.-%. Promoters might increase the selectivity to phthalic anhydride (e.g. potas- sium), stabilise the anatase form of the support (e.g. Mo) or improve long term stability of the catalyst (e.g. Sb). The improved catalytic performance of promoted vanadia catalysts is usually attributed to a change in acid-base or redox properties. Presumably, surface acidity is the most thoroughly discussed parameter. The adsorption strength of the reactants and products is a function of the acidity of surface sites and the relative acidity of the organic molecules. o-Xylene is less acidic (more basic) than the products phtalic anhydride and maleic anhy- dride. This is the basis of some patents suggesting the use of two catalyst layers [2]. The upper one (reactor entrance) has a low acidity to suppress destructive oxidation of o-xylene. In the lower part of the reactor, with high product concentration, the aim is to weaken the adsorption of phthalic anhydride to prevent its total oxidation. This may be achieved by applying a more acidic catalyst. Many groups have reported the influence of basic (alkali oxides) [7-10] and acidic (phosphorus oxide) promoters [ 10,11] on the selectivity in o-xylene and also in toluene oxidation. Note that the interpretation of the role of promoters is sometimes ambiguous due to formation of new phases during calcination or o-xylene oxidation, such as KVO3 after promotion with potassium [ 10]. Another point is that a clear identification of the influence of acidic and basic surface sites on the rate and selectivity of the oxidation process is only possible with a precise knowledge of the mechanism and the rates of the elementary steps. The influence of acidic and basic promoters on the catalytic performance of vanadia/ titania has also been investigated in methanol oxidation [ 12 ]. It has been proposed that the strength of the bridging vanadium-oxygen-support bond controls the activity of these catalysts. Spectroscopic measurements indicated that basic promoters, such as K20, destroy this bond and lead to a loss of activity. Acidic promoters, such as WO3, have been found to be coordinated directly to the titania support; they do not change the vanadium-oxygen- support interaction and hardly influence the activity. According to this explanation only the selectivity of vanadia/titania catalysts may be improved by promotion. There are various methods suggested for the determination of the (relative) acidity of oxides. The following order of acidity was found by Tanabe [ 13 ] for some oxides relevant in o-xylene oxidation, using amine titration in the presence of Hammett indicators: WO3 > SnO2 > Bi203 > V205 > BaO > K20 However, this and other acidity orders should be treated with caution. On one hand, different methods including base titration, adsorption of bases, determination of OH groups and M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 243 determination of electron acceptor properties, result in different acidity orders [ 14]. On the other hand, the relative acidity of an oxide depends on the presence of other oxides or impurities, on preparation method, etc. For example, the acidity of titania-supported vanadia is a function of vanadia content and vanadia dispersion [2]. For binary oxides, the highest acid strengths are found to increase with the increase of the algebraically averaged electronegativities of the metal ions, and decrease with the increase of partial negative charge of oxygen [ 13]. It is interesting to show how the acid strength of titania depends on the second compound of the mixed oxide: Ti-Si ~ Ti-Zr > Ti-A1 > Ti-Sn -- Ti-Zn = Ti-Cd > Ti-Bi > Ti-Mg Obviously, the redox property of these multicomponent oxidic catalysts is also a relevant parameter, o-Xylene oxidation follows the two step mechanism proposed by Mars and Van Krevelen [ 15]. Generally speaking, this mechanism involves catalyst reduction by the organic molecule and reoxidation of the catalyst surface by oxygen. It has been found [ 16] that selectivity to phthalic anhydride increases with the amount of vanadium present in the V5 + oxidation state at reaction temperature. One can conclude that those promoters which change the oxidation state of vanadia under reaction conditions, should have an influence on the catalytic performance. A similar concept has been suggested for the oxidation of olefins [ 17]. The molybdena catalyst used in the latter reaction is partially reduced, as is vanadia in o-xylene oxidation, which results in a decreased number of active sites. Promotion of molybdena ( \"acceptor\" ) with an oxide capable of donating oxygen by spill-over ( \"donor\" ) increases activity and selectivity by restoring the higher oxidation state of the acceptor. The suggested mechanism is called \"remote control effect\". Good oxygen donors for molybdena in olefin oxidation are Bi203 and SnO2. An interesting coordination chemical approach has been proposed for a wide range of oxidation reactions on oxidic catalysts [ 18 ]. The bond between reactant and catalyst was described as an electron pair donor-acceptor interaction. A basic catalyst (strong donor) increases this interaction, which results in deep oxidation. For selective oxidation, acidic oxides have to be chosen. In the present paper, we report the influence of promotion of vanadia/titania with the oxides (or carbonates) of Sn, W, Bi, Ba and K. The 8 wt.-% vanadia/titania catalyst was prepared by impregnation of an anatase support material with vanadyl oxalate. According to literature data, these promoters have substantially different acid-base and redox proper- ties. The aim of our work was to reveal which of these two important characteristics has higher influence on activity, selectivity and stability of vanadia/titania catalysts in o-xylene oxidation. The role of pretreatment conditions on the catalytic performances of promoted vanadia/titania catalysts will also be discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation A V205/TiO2 catalyst was prepared as described by S aleh et al. [ 19 ]. The anatase-titania support (EL10, Rh6ne-Poulenc) contained 0.04 wt.-% K20, 0.22 wt.-% Nb205 and 0.24 244 M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 Table 1 Catalyst compositions Code Promoter Promoter content Promoter precursor (wt.-%) V - - - KV K20 0.21 K acetate BaV BaO 0.67 Ba acetate BiV Bi~O3 1.03 B i ( NO3 ) 3\" 5HzO SnV SnO2 0.33 Sn oxalate WV WO3 | .0 (NH4) 6H2W12040 wt.-% P205. This titania (40 g) was impregnated with vanadyl oxalate, prepared by dis- solving 3.48 g V205 in 8 g oxalic acid and 8 ml water. Mixing, drying for 14 h at 120 and calcination for 3 h at 450 (heating rate approximately 5 min- ~) resulted in an 8 wt.-%VEOs/TiO2 catalyst (code V). This calcination procedure was shown to give a complete decomposition of vanadyl oxalate to vanadia [ 19 ]. At higher calcination temper- atures, the formation of a solid solution of V4+ in the TiO: support was observed which was accompanied by a transformation of anatase into rutile, and a loss of phthalic anhydride selectivity. Catalyst V was promoted with W, Sn, Bi, Ba and K compounds with a promoter-to- vanadium atomic ratio of 1:20. Table 1 lists catalyst compositions and precursors. Note that all promoters are considered formally as oxides throughout the paper according to the usual terminology, though it is known that above 250 barium oxalate is converted to carbonate, which is stable up to 1000 [20]. Similarly, K20 rapidly reacts with water or CO2 and forms hydroxides, carbonates or hydrocarbonates. Unfortunately, the real phase structure of promoters before or after the oxidation reaction could not be determined by XRD due to their low concentration. The appropriate amount of promoter precursor was dissolved in 3 ml of a 5% aqueous acetic acid solution, which was used to impregnate 5 g of catalyst V. Drying and calcination were performed as on the unpromoted catalyst V. In the case of catalyst SnV, the precursor was dissolved in an ammonium tartrate solution (precursor:tartrate-- 1:3 mol ratio). Cata- lyst BaV was made using a 2% acetic acid solution. At the applied calcination temperature all solvents evaporate or decompose completely, precursors are converted to the correspond- ing oxides (or carbonates) and Snn is oxidised to SnTM. 2.2. Catalyst characterisation BET surface areas and pore diameters were measured by nitrogen physisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. X-ray diffraction measurements of the crystal struc- ture were performed in a Siemens D5000 powder diffractometer. Atomic absorption spec- troscopic analysis (AAS) of the bulk composition of the catalysts was carried out with a Philips PU 9400 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. High resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) as well as scanning trans- mission electron microscopic (STEM) studies were made using a Philips CM303T (300 M.G. Nobbenhuis et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 245 kV) instrument equipped with an STEM unit and a Tracor Northern TN5400 microanalytical facility (EDX). The EDX detector was a high-purity germanium detector. Surface composition and valency states were determined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos S-800 instrument and Mg Ks radiation. The instrument was operated at a constant pass energy of 40 eV, energy resolution being 1.0 eV (Ag 3ds/2). No sample pretreatment was carried out prior to insertion in the analysis chamber. Peaks were calibrated with respect to the Ti 2p3/2 signal at 459.0 eV in order to compensate for charging effects. The O 1 s X-ray satellite was substracted from the V 2p signal. Atomic surface concentrations were calculated using empirical cross section values [ 21 ]. Catalyst reducibilities were measured by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in the apparatus described earlier [ 22 ]. Approximately 200 mg catalyst was heated to 750 at a rate of 10 min ~ in a 75 ml min-~ flow of 5% hydrogen in argon. No sample pretreatment was applied. Acidic properties of the catalysts were characterised by ammonia adsorption and desorp- tion measurements. These experiments were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer 1710 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a temperature-controlled environmental chamber (Starna, model HCV-D3) [23]. 70 mg powder sample was pretreated by heating in 7.2% O2/Ar up to 300 with a rate of 7 min- 1. After 60 min, the sample was cooled down to 25 and flushed with argon for 30 min. The chamber was flushed with 3600 ppm ammonia in argon for 30 min, then 2 h with argon. Diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia were recorded with a resolution of 8 cm- 1, averaging 50 scans. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was studied in argon. A heating rate of 7 min- ~ up to 300 was applied. Desorption gases were analysed with a Balzers QMGI25 mass spectrometer. During TPD, FT-IR spectra were recorded in 25 intervals (50 scans, 8 cm-1). All FT-IR spectra are presented as Kubelka-Munk functions [24] f(R/Ro) = [1 - (R/Ro)]2/ [2(R/Ro) ] in order to emphasise intense features. The back- ground spectrum of the unloaded catalyst, recorded during pretreatment at 300 under argon, was subtracted. 2.3. o-Xylene oxidation Catalytic properties of the multicomponent mixed oxides were determined in partial oxidation of o-xylene in a recycle reactor described previously [25]. A feed of 250 ml min-~ (STP) was used, which contained 0.55 mol-% o-xylene in air. External product recycling was applied to increase total flow rate in the reactor to 15 1 min ~ (recycle ratio 60). The U-shaped reactor with an internal diameter of 10 mm was filled with inert quartz beads and immersed in a heated fluidised sand bath in order to achieve better temperature control. 0.5 g catalyst grains of 0.3-0.5 mm diameter were mixed with 1.0 g inert quartz of equal size to enhance heat transfer. The high flow rate resulted in an inlet pressure of 2 bar (abs.). On-line product analysis of the partial oxidation products was performed by a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a 0.53 mm 20 m fused silica column coated with 2.65/xm methyl silicone gum (HP-1). CO and CO2 were analysed with infrared analysers (Maihak FINOR and UNOR). The activity and selectivity for o-xylene-phthalic anhydride transformation was measured at a constant temperature of 382 for a period of 24 h. Start-up procedure consisted of 246 M.G. Nobbenhuis et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 heating the catalyst in air to 375 at a rate of 7 min-1, then switching to a mixed o-xylene/air flow. Products were analysed every 30 minutes. Data are represented in figures by continuous lines, obtained by fitting second-to-fourth order polynomials (standard devi- ation between 0.01 and 0.0005), to the corresponding sets consisting of at least 25 data points. After 24 h, the reaction was stopped by immersing the reactor into a dry ice/acetone mixture under o-xylene/air flow, in order to minimise changes before characterisation of the used catalyst. A different procedure was used to measure temperature dependence of activity and selectivity. The catalysts were pretreated by heating in a mixed o-xylene/air flow to 250 at a rate of 7 min- i. Reaction products were analysed after one hour stabilisation. Product analysis was repeated after each stepwise increase of the temperature by 5-25 and a one hour stabilisation. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Surface area and morphology BET surface areas of the titania support and the vanadia/titania catalyst (V) were similar ( 10.7 and 11.7 m2 g- 1, respectively). A decrease in the average pore diameter of titania from over 100 nm to 50 nm was observed after the introduction of vanadia. Electron microscopic studies combined with EDX analysis revealed the inhomogeneity of the catalysts. Catalyst V contained separate, spherical titania particles of about 50-300 nm in size, which were partially covered by vanadia. Smaller elongated vanadia crystallites of about 15 125 nm were also detected. Obviously, vanadia crystallites filled a part of the space between titania particles, which resulted in the observed decrease in pore diameter, but had a minor influence on the specific surface area. It was proved that introduction of a promoter did not influence the vanadia distribution detectably. No separate promoter crystallites could be detected, but the presence of pro- moters was proved by EDX and AAS analysis. Fig. 1 shows the different shapes of titania and vanadia particles in the used SnV catalyst as an example. More details of the TEM/ EDX and EELS study of catalysts V and SnV are reported elsewhere [26]. XRD measurements on catalyst V revealed both anatase and small vanadia crystals, in agreement with the electron microscopic measurements. No change in crystallinity could be detected by XRD measurements after 24 h use in o-xylene oxidation. 3.2. Reducibility Redox properties of catalysts are an important parameter for the catalytic performance in o-xylene oxidation, which involves continuous oxidation and reduction of the catalyst. Usually, redox properties of mixed oxide catalysts are studied by temperature-programmed reduction with H2, CO or low molecular weight alkanes. It is well known that redox processes taking place at around 400 between the catalyst surface and o-xylene cannot be simply M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 247 Fig. 1. High resolution transmission electron micrograph of catalyst SnV after 24 h use in o-xylene oxidation at 382. modelled with reduction using the above-mentioned model reactants. Nevertheless, it is a widely used method to obtain some information on the reducibility of the catalysts. Accordingly, catalyst reducibilities are characterised by temperature-programmed reduc- tion with hydrogen. Reduction profiles for unpromoted and promoted vanadia/titania cat- alysts are shown in Fig. 2. Starting and maximum temperatures of the TPR peaks are collected in Table 2. The reduction profile of the unpromoted catalyst V shows two characteristic peaks. The first peak is usually attributed to reduction of vanadia in close contact with the titania support (\"monolayer\") and the second peak is associated with the presence of bulk crystalline vanadia [ 3 ]. Hydrogen consumption during TPR of the unpromoted catalyst V corresponds to a complete reduction of V205 to V203, as evidenced in previous studies [ 27 ]. Promotion of vanadia with only 5 mol-% metal oxide has a great influence on catalyst reducibility. Treating catalyst V with a 5% acetic acid solution without any precursor and subsequent drying and calcination, as done in the promotion procedure, did not change the reduction profile. Consequently, the observed changes in reduction profile can only be due to the presence of promoters. Hydrogen consumption for reduction of the promoter itself is almost negligible compared to the experimental error (5-10%) as the relative amount of promoter is low. 248 M.G.

Van Hengstum et al. [ 10] and Bond and Tahir [ 28] investigated several vanadia/ titania catalysts with vanadia loadings below the monolayer content, and reported an increase in reduction peak maximum of almost 100 caused by addition of 0.4 wt.-% K20. No data for comparison has been found in the literature for Sn-, W- and Bi-promoted catalysts. Reduction starts around 380 for all catalysts apart from tin- and bismuth-promoted catalysts, which show a lower onset of reduction. Considering peak maxima and onset of M.G. Nobbenhuis et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 249 reduction, the only unambiguous conclusion is that bismuth and especially tin promotion increases the reducibility of vanadia deposited on titania. For the other promoters, the interpretation of TPR data is difficult as both of the characteristic peaks are shifted by promotion, but in opposite directions. The considerable differences between the TPR curves indicate there is a considerable electronic interaction between vanadia and promoter oxides, obviously due to the fact that the promoters are partly located on vanadia. TPR measurements of the catalysts were repeated after use in o-xylene oxidation for 24 h. Differences between profiles of fresh and used catalysts were moderate to negligible. The TPR curve of catalyst SnV after o-xylene oxidation is shown at the bottom of Fig. 2 as an example. Note that much stronger influence of o-xylene oxidation on the reducibility of a 7 wt.-% vanadia/titania catalyst has been reported earlier [29]. A possible reason of this alteration may be the difference in methods applied to stop the reaction, as will be discussed later. 3.3. XPS measurements The surface compositions of catalysts V, SnV and KV were characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The selection was based on the catalytic properties, which will be discussed later. Table 3 lists binding energies of the catalysts before and after use in o- xylene oxidation. XPS measurements showed a V 2p3/2 signal at 517.1 _+0.2 eV for all three catalysts. This value corresponds to V5 +, as V4 + would show a V 2p3/2 signal around 516 eV [ 30]. This was confirmed by the fact that deconvolution of the V 2p3/2 signal into two peaks (V4+ and V5+) was not possible. This conclusion is also supported by XRD analysis which showed the presence of V205 and no reduced vanadia species. Furthermore, the stoichiometry observed in TPR measurements indicates that the major part of vanadia is present as V5 +. However, it cannot be excluded that a small fraction of vanadium (below the detection limits of the above methods) is present as V4+ in the bulk of the particles. There is a discrepancy in the literature concerning the existence of an intermediate V4 + layer on the anatase surface. Centi et al. [31,32] and Sanati et al. [33] found this layer by titrimetric and XPS measurements after removal of a surface layer of soluble V5 + by diluted sulphuric acid or ammonia. However, it is possible that the measured oxidation state of vanadium is influenced by a possible reaction with Ti3 + dissolved in sulphuric acid [34].

XPS characterisation of the catalysts after use in o-xylene oxidation (24 h at 382) showed no detectable change in oxidation state of vanadium. This result is in contradiction to former observations based on laser Raman spectroscopy that in a 7 wt.-% vanadia/titania catalyst, vanadia was partially reduced during reaction [ 19,29]. Our opinion is that the basic source of this deviation is the difficulty of stopping the reaction and taking the catalyst out of the reactor without altering its oxidation state. As discussed in the introduction, during reaction active sites of the catalyst are continuously reduced by reactant and intermediates and re-oxidised by oxygen. If the relative rate of these two processes is changed by the stoppingprocedure, the oxidation state of active sites will change and the measurement will not be characteristic of in-situ conditions. We kept gas flows constant during the very fast cooling procedure, while Saleh et al. [ 19,29] purged the reactor with nitrogen before removing from the salt bath. There is no way to prove which procedure is correct until the real oxidation state of the catalyst can be measured in-situ. However, we believe that if oxygen is substituted by nitrogen at reaction temperature, reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface rapidly reduce the active sites, which explains the observed decrease in the vanadium oxidation state [ 19,29]. Whereas we could not find any evidence for the presence of V4 + or V3 +, the surface composition of the multicomponent catalysts was considerably influenced by the oxidation reaction (Table 4). During reaction, the V:Ti mass ratio increased in all catalysts from 0.37-0.42 to a final value of 0.46---0.5. A minor decrease of the surface concentration of promoters was seen as well. An interesting feature is that the surface vanadia concentration was independent of the presence of promoters. The bulk concentrations, measured by AAS, did not change during the catalytic tests. Consequently, the change in surface concentrations was probably caused by the increased coverage of titania with vanadia. Note that V:Ti ratios of around 0.5 are typical for vanadia/titania catalysts with loadings above monolayer capacity [ 35,36]. Interestingly, there was no detectable difference in morphology between fresh and used catalysts, in contrast to the significant restructuring during o-xylene oxidation. 3.4. Acidity measurements The adsorption of ammonia was studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 251 spectra of ammonia adsorbed on the unpromoted catalyst V at room temperature. The strong peak at 1430-1435 cm- ~ and the medium peak at around 1670 cm- ~ have been attributed earlier to asymmetric and symmetric bending vibration of NH~ (Bronsted acid sites). The peak at 1610 cm- ~ corresponds to asymmetric bending vibration of coordinated ammonia (Lewis acid sites) [38]. N-H stretching vibrations of ammonia were found as broad adsorption bands between 3150 and 3400 cm ~ and those ofNH4+ between 2800 and 3000 cm ~ (not shown in Fig. 3). The TiO2 support exhibited a strong Lewis acidity (1605 cm ~) at room temperature, and no Brcnsted acidity was found. On the vanadia/titania sample V, a strong BrCnsted peak at 1435 cm-J was observed and Lewis acidity (1615 cm ~) was less pronounced than on the titania support, which is in agreement with earlier observations [ 39 ]. The spectra measured on catalyst V and on the promoted catalysts were rather similar. The only exception was sample KV, in which Brcmsted acidity was reduced. During temperature-programmed desorption, Lewis and Brc~nsted peaks disappeared at 175 (Fig. 3). The amount of adsorbed ammonia, measured by temperature-programmed desorption using a mass spectrometer, was about 3.1 /xmol m 2 on most of the catalysts (experimental error ___ 10%). The value measured on catalyst V is in good agreement with earlier data [40] obtained on a 6.5 wt.-% vanadia/titania sample at 25 and 400 (2.7 and 1.4 /~mol m-2, respectively). The only exception was sample KV, on which ammonia rr v 1800 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 wavenumber / cm1 Fig. 3.

Both BrOnsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites can be seen. Pretreatment: I h in 02 at 300, 30 min in Ar at 25, 30 min in 3600 ppm NH3/Ar at 25, 2 h in Ar at 25. 252 M.G. Nobbenhuis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 adsorption was unambiguously reduced (2.2/zmol m-2). FT-IR peak intensities showed that not only the amount of acidic sites, but also the ratio of the Br~nsted/Lewis sites decreased by promotion with potassium. Consequently, only promotion with potassium decreased the number of acidic sites significantly on the vanadia/titania; K20/KOH appears to interact specifically with the Br~nsted sites on vanadia. The moderate influence of the promoters on acidity, compared to the experimental error, may be due to their low concen- tration (0.3-1.0 wt.-%) and to the high amount of acidic P205 impurity in the titania support (0.24 wt.-%). An interesting question is what caused the substantial differences between the behaviour observed for the potassium- and the barium-promoted catalysts. Both promoters are strongly basic compared to the other promoters, but only catalyst KV was less acidic than the unpromoted catalyst V. This discrepancy might be explained by a different location of the promoters on the titania-supported vanadia. Potassium may be located on vanadia and decreases BrCnsted acidity. Barium may be located on the titania support, and influences only Lewis acidity. The amount of ammonia desorbed from the titania support is small ( 1.2 /~mol m-2), and a change in this value may be hidden within the experimental error. However, this explanation is in contradiction to TPR measurements (Table 2 and Fig. 2), according to which the potassium and barium promoters had a similar influence on the reducibility of vanadia/titania, indicating that both promoters are located mainly on vanadia. Ammonia desorption measured by mass spectrometry was complete on all samples at 300, with a desorption maximum at 100. On simultaneously recorded FT-IR spectra, the disappearance of all ammonia bands was observed at 125 on the catalyst KV, at 150 on BaV and BiV, and at 175 on V, SnV and WV. These results indicate that the approx- imate acidity order of promoted and unpromoted catalysts based on strength of acidic sites is the following: KV < BaV = BiV < V = WV ~ SnV Again, a possible explanation for the absence of the influence of (expectedly) more acidic tin and tungsten oxides is that they coordinate preferentially with the titania support and therefore can not effect acidic properties of vanadia, as has already been suggested earlier [ 12]. Though there is no direct evidence for the location of promoters, this explanation would contradict the TPR results: tin oxide has the highest influence on the reducibility of vanadia which indicates some sort of interaction between promoter and vanadia. 3.5. o-Xylene oxidation 3.5.1. Temperature dependence In Figs. 4 and 5, o-xylene conversion and selectivity to phthalic anhydride over the unpromoted and promoted catalysts are plotted as a function of temperature. There is a moderate influence of reaction temperature on the relative order of activities of these catalysts. The turning point is about 350, above which value the barium- and potassium- promoted catalysts exhibit significantly lower activities (lower conversion) than the others, whereas at 330 their performances are the best. The temperature dependence of the promotion effect on phthalic anhydride selectivity is more pronounced, as can be seen in Fig. 5. Again a change in the order with temperature M.G.

Below 370, the best catalysts are potassium- and barium- promoted vanadia/titania. The positive effect of alkali promoters at low conversions has already been reported by several authors [ 10,7,8]. Above 370, the highest selectivity to phthalic anhydride was measured on catalysts SnV and WV. Our results support ideas presented in several patents (ref. [ 2] and references therein) on the application of two catalyst layers in the reactor. The upper part contains basic 254 M. G. Nobbenhuis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 promoters to improve catalytic performance of vanadia/titania at low conversion, and the lower part is more acidic to prevent over-oxidation. 3.5.2. Time dependence Measuring conversion and selectivity at different temperatures is a fast method to test catalysts, but interpretation of the results may be difficult due to the strong interaction between conversion and selectivity. To obtain another insight into the catalytic performance, a series of catalytic experiments were performed at constant temperature. With all catalysts, the highest yields (i.e. conversion selectivity) of phthalic anhydride were achieved at almost complete conversion between 375 and 400. In this temperature range, selectivity to phthalic anhydride is hardly affected by temperature. Therefore, stability of the catalysts has been measured at 382, which is also typical for industrial applications [2]. Catalytic performances of the samples were tested for 24 h. o-Xylene conversions are plotted in Fig. 6. The activity is practically constant in all cases except for the potassium-promoted catalyst KV, which shows an increase in conversion from 70 to 83% during the one day test. Selectivity to phthalic anhydride (Fig. 7) shows a slight increase with time, especially in the first 5-15 h on stream. There are only two catalysts (BiV and KV) whose selectivity has not reached a maximum within 24 h. Con- sidering both conversion and selectivity we can conclude that none of the promoters has a positive influence on the catalytic performance of vanadia/titania under these conditions. Analysis of some intermediates and by-products offers some explanation to the influence of promoters on selectivity towards phthalic anhydride. The following components, in addition to the main product phthalic anhydride, were identified by GC and infrared spec- troscopic analysis: o-tolualdehyde and phthalide intermediates, maleic anhydride, CO, CO2 and benzoic acid over-oxidation products. The influence of promotion on o-tolualdehyde selectivity is shown in Fig. 8. The amount of this intermediate is usually low at this high 1 O0 o~ 9O t- O ~9 > 80 c O O (D t- (D >. 7O x 60 .................................. q-'~ ~( SnV V BiV ....................... ~,~ / BaV 5 10 15 20 time / h 25 Fig. 6. o-Xylene conversion during the first 24 h on stream at 382.

Selectivity to phthalide, which is an undesired constituent in the product due to its difficult separation from phthalic anhydride, is shown in Fig. 9. The influence of promoters is similar to that observed in the case of o-tolualdehyde. The role of promoters is different concerning selectivity to maleic anhydride (Fig. 10). On all promoted catalysts, except BaV, selectivity to maleic anhydride is higher than on the unpromoted catalyst V, but the differences are hardly more than 1%. Total oxidation selectivity (Fig. 11 ) is more important, since CO and CO2 are the main by-products at high conversions. The change with time in selectivity to phthalic anhydride 256 M.G.

(Fig. 7) may be correlated with the change in rate of total oxidation for most of the catalysts. For example, on the bismuth-promoted catalyst total oxidation selectivity decreases by 5- 6% in 24 h, in agreement with the continuous improvement in phthalic anhydride selectivity. After 15 h use there is no big difference between promoted and unpromoted catalysts with the exception of BaV. It is clear from Fig. 11 that the poor performance of the barium- promoted catalyst is mainly due to the strong tendency towards total oxidation. In general, barium promotion leads to an increased formation of total oxidation products and inter- mediates o-tolualdehyde and phthalide, at the cost of phthalic anhydride and maleic anhy- M.G.

The same effect, although much less pronounced, is found upon promotion with K20 and Bi203. Although the period of 24 h is quite short compared to the industrial use, we still can draw conclusions concerning the stability of promoted and unpromoted catalysts. It is clear from Figs. 6-11 that there is a considerable restructuring of the potassium-promoted cata- lysts resulting in an improved conversion and selectivity to phthalic anhydride. The phthalic anhydride selectivity of almost all the catalysts increased during this period. It is very likely that the restructuring of the catalysts has not been finished in 24 h. The change of the catalytic characteristics is in good agreement with the change in surface composition observed with XPS analysis (Table 4). The outstanding improvement of conversion and selectivity of potassium-promoted catalysts is likely to be due to the high mobility of potassium. Unfortunately the formation of any new phases between promoter and vanadia could not be observed by XRD analysis due to the low promoter content. 3.5.3. Role of catalyst pretreatment The study of catalyst stability (or time dependence) during 24 h at 382 yielded an astonishing result: the unpromoted vanadia/titania surpassed all promoted catalysts (Figs. 6 and 7). It is interesting to compare these data with those obtained in the investigation of temperature dependence (Figs. 4 and 5). Phthalic anhydride yields in Table 5 have been obtained under identical conditions with the exception of catalyst pretreatment. Method A: Catalyst samples were heated at a constant rate up to 250 in an o-xylene/air flow, after which the catalysts were tested at intermediate temperatures during 15 h before reaching the temperature of 382. Method B: Catalysts were heated up close to reaction temperature (382) with a constant rate in air but in the absence of o-xylene. The two methods resulted in different yields and a different order of promoted and unpromoted catalysts. In the former case, tin- and tungsten-promoted catalysts were slightly better than the unpromoted catalyst. When the catalysts were pretreated in air at a temperature close to reaction temperature, the 258 M.G.

Conclusions The aim of our study was to elucidate the importance of acid-base and redox properties of vanadia/titania by modifying its properties using several promoters. In order to get a comprehensive picture, several methods and techniques have been applied: catalytic tests under various conditions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy, ammonia adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption combined with FT-IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen, atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, surface area and porosity measurements. In many instances, catalysts were characterised before and after use in o-xylene oxidation at 382 for 24 h. The most important conclusions are the following: (i) The location of promoters could not be identified by a STEM/EDX analysis due to the low promoter content, but a significant interaction between the promoters and vanadia has been evidenced indirectly by TPR. (ii)There are clear indications on the restructuring of the promoted and unpromoted catalysts during o-xylene oxidation reaction at 382. This restructuring results in a higher V/Ti surface ratio without affecting crystallinity or crystal size. Surface enrich- ment in vanadia and the final surface vanadia content is hardly influenced by pro- motion. The time dependence of selectivity indicates that surface restructuring is not finished in 24 b. (iii) The reducibility of vanadia/titania by hydrogen is significantly improved by tin and bismuth promotion. Changes in reducibility during use were moderate. No evidence for reduction of V205 during reaction and formation of a V4+ layer on the anatase surface could be found. The oxidation state of vanadia was V5 +, independent of promotion. M.G. Nobbenhuis et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 241-260 259 (iv)The strength of acidic sites on vanadia was decreased by potassium, barium and bismuth promotion, but it was unaffected by tin and tungsten oxides. The number of acidic sites was influenced (decreased) detectably only by potassium promotion, interacting preferentially with the Br~nsted sites on vanadia. (v) The pretreatment conditions strongly influence the catalytic performance of the two- and three-component catalysts. Important parameters are the temperature and the nature of the atmosphere (only air or both air and o-xylene). (vi) The influence of a promotional oxide on a o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride may be positive, negative or negligible depending on the reaction temperature, con- version and catalyst pretreatment conditions. Basic promoters (K, Ba) improve selec- tivity substantially and conversion moderately at low temperature, but above 370 their influence is negative. At this higher temperature and at conversions above 95% only SnO2 and WO3 could increase the selectivity by a few percent. (vii) There are not enough data available for a clear correlation between redox properties and catalytic features of the catalysts. The SnO2-promoted catalyst showed the highest reducibility by hydrogen and this catalyst produced the highest amount of phthalic anhydride after pretreatment in an air/o-xylene mixture. However, the good catalytic properties may also be explained by the strength of acidic sites in this sample. The correlation between reducibility and catalytic performance was poor in the case of the other catalysts. (viii) There is quite a good correlation between the strength of the acidic sites and the phthalic anhydride yield above 370: acidity order: KV < BaV = BiV < V = WV = SnV; catalytic performance: BaV < KV < BiV < V = WV = SnV. A contrasting correlation is achieved at low conversion and low temperature. Under these conditions the catalytic performance decreases with increasing acidity: catalytic performance: WV < SnV < V < BaV < BiV < KV. Acknowledgement The authors are grateful to H.

The influence of K, Ba, Bi, W and Sn oxides or carbonates on catalytic properties of vanadia/titania in the oxidation ofo-xylene to phthalic anhydride has been studied in a recycle reactor. In general, conversion and selectivity were strongly influenced by pretreatment conditions (temperature, nature of atmosphere). A restructuring of the catalysts was observed duringo-xylene oxidation, resulting in higher V/Ti surface ratios, without changing crystallinity or crystal size. Acid-base properties of the catalysts were characterised by ammonia adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption, combined with FT-IR and mass spectroscopic analysis. At temperatures higher than 370°C, good correlation was observed between the strength of acid sites (K <Ba ≈ Bi < unpromoted ≈W ≈ Sn) and phthalic anhydride yield (K < Ba < Bi < unpromoted ≈ W ≈ Sn). At low conversion and temperature only basic promoters had a positive influence. Redox properties were studied by TPR and XPS analysis. The oxidation state of vanadium was + 5 before and after reaction and it was independent of promotion. SnO2 and Bi2O3 improved the reducibility of vanadia by hydrogen, but no general correlation could be observed between redox properties and catalytic features.

In general, conversion and selectivity were strongly influenced by pretreatment conditions (temperature, nature of atmosphere). A restructuring of the catalysts was observed duringo-xylene oxidation, resulting in higher V/Ti surface ratios, without changing crystallinity or crystal size. Acid-base properties of the catalysts were characterised by ammonia adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption, combined with FT-IR and mass spectroscopic analysis.
