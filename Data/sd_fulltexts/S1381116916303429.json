Graphical abstract A series of copper-promoted platinum supported on activated carbon (Cu-Pt/AC) catalysts were investigated for glycerol oxidation to lactic acid. The catalytic performance of 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst was greatly influenced by Cu loading (0.1–2.0wt%). Among them, the 0.5%Cu–1.0%Pt/AC catalyst showed the best promotional effect, whose lactic acid yield was 2.4 times of that on 1.0%Pt/AC under same reaction conditions. Characterizations were carried out to explore the relationships between catalyst properties and reaction performances. TEM images show that the introduction of Cu improves the dispersion of Pt and Cu, and some Pt-Cu interfaces are detected by HR-TEM, which would facilitate the glycerol transformation. XPS and H2-TPR analyses reveal that good catalyst performance is related with not only a proper surface Pt/Cu molar ratio, but also copper species’ oxidation states. Cu+ and Cu0 species favor glycerol conversion and lactic acid production, whereas large CuO particles facilitate the formation of glyceric acid. Keywords Cu promoter Pt Glycerol Oxidation Lactic acid 1 Introduction Lactic acid (LA), known as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, is a molecule of great attraction in the booming bio-refinery industry. It has versatile applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [1]. It also shows major potential in producing biodegradable PLA (polylactic acid) polymers, whose production is estimated to reach 1 million tons per year by 2020 [2]. Currently, LA is mainly produced by the fermentation of corn or other food based feedstock [3]. However, large scale fermentation is facing challenges in sustainability because of its low efficiency, waste disposal issues and worldwide food shortage. Therefore, developing alternative routes to LA has become a new challenge for scientists. As the major byproduct of biodiesel production, glycerol is a promising feedstock for the manufacture of high value chemicals. The production of LA from glycerol has been investigated through different approaches. Hydrothermal reforming of glycerol was first reported by Kishida, affording a LA molar yield of 90% in the presence of NaOH at 300°C [4]. Catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol over Ru and Pt catalysts in NaOH solution was also explored, which gave 45% yield of LA at 200°C under 4MPa of H2 [5]. Such severe operation conditions led to higher costs and risks in industrial applications. The selective oxidation of glycerol to LA is more attractive compared with aforementioned methods. Its operation conditions are generally moderate. For example, Shen and co-workers reported a one-pot aerobic oxidation of glycerol over an Au-Pt/TiO2 catalyst at 90°C in NaOH solution and obtained 84.8% selectivity to LA [6]. Heeres et al. disclosed that an Au-Pt/CeO2 catalyst gave 80% LA selectivity at high glycerol conversion at 100°C in NaOH solution [7]. Because of the synergistic effect between Au and Pt, bimetallic catalysts showed improved catalytic activity in glycerol oxidation to LA. Considering the scarcity and price of noble metals, exploring an efficient catalyst with lower cost is highly desirable. Recently, Li et al. reported Ni promoted noble metal catalysts (PtmNinOx/TiO2 and Pd1Ni1Ox/TiO2) for glycerol oxidation to LA in the presence of NaOH solution, which achieved 99.1% glycerol conversion and 62.6% LA selectivity in the first run of the reaction [8]. However, its glycerol conversion declined to 57.2% during the recycling experiments. The application of other non-noble metal promoters in glycerol oxidation to LA is still to be explored. Among non-noble metals, copper attracts much attention in glycerol utilization because of its advantages in dehydrogenation and lower activity for C-C cleavage [9–11]. Liu et al. reported that CuO was a better support than TiO2 and NiO in base-free glycerol oxidation reactions [9]. Xia et al. employed Cu/LDH (layered double hydroxide) in glycerol hydrogenolysis toward propanediols owing to its superiority to Ni and Co [10]. Roy et al. demonstrated that CuO, Cu2O and Cu/SiO2 were effective for glycerol conversion to LA at 200°C under 1.4MPa of N2 in the presence of NaOH [11]. Meanwhile, Cu promoter has also been widely adopted in alcohol oxidation reactions [12–14]. For example, Li et al. found strong synergistic effect between Au and Cu in aerobic oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde [12]. The Pt-Cu catalyst has also been intensively investigated in methanol oxidation reactions, which exhibited superior activity to monometallic Pt catalyst [13,14]. However, few researches covered the utilization of copper as a catalyst promoter in selective oxidation of glycerol to LA. Herein, we reported the catalytic performance of non-noble metal Cu-promoted 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst in glycerol oxidation to LA. The Cu-Pt/AC catalysts were characterized by ICP-OES, N2 physical adsorption, H2-TPR, XPS, TEM and XRD to reveal their structure-function relationships. The optimized 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst exhibited stable activity during the recycling experiments. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials H2PtCl6·H2O (Pt≥38%, Shanghai Jiuyue, China), Cu (NO3)2·3H2O (>99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, China), NaBH4 (>98% Tianjin Hainachuan, China), LiOH·H2O (>90%, Tianjin Kermel, China) and glycerol (>99%, Tianjin Guangfu, China) were all used as received. Activated carbon (AC, >99%, Tangshan United Carbon, China) was cleaned with deionized water to eliminate mineral impurities and crushed to 100 − 200mesh before use. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The impregnation and deposition-precipitation (DP) methods [15] were adopted for the catalyst preparation. In a typical preparation experiment of Cu-promoted Pt/AC catalyst, certain amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 4mL deionized water and then impregnated onto 2.0g of AC support. Then it was dried at 120°C for 12h and reduced at 400°C in a H2 flow for 4h. Sequentially, the Cu/AC sample was dispersed in 200mL of distilled water with vigorous stirring, and an H2PtCl6 solution was added. After 0.5h, excess amount of NaBH4 solution was dropped slowly into the suspension at 70°C, and the pre-adsorbed metal precursors would be reduced on the AC support. The suspended solution was kept stirring for 6h. Afterward, the black precipitates were filtered and washed several times with deionized water until Cl− was not detected by AgNO3 solution. Then the resultant solid was dried at 120°C for 12h. By changing the Cu loading, a series of xCu-1.0wt%Pt/AC catalysts were obtained (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0wt%). The catalyst was denoted according to its metal loading. For example, 0.2%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC indicated that the weight percent of Cu and Pt were 0.2wt% and 1.0wt%, respectively. Similar to our previous report [16], the 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst here was prepared via DP method; yet the reduction temperature was elevated from room temperature to 70°C in order to keep in line with above Cu-promoted Pt/AC catalysts. 2.3 Catalyst characterization Metal content analysis (Table S1) was tested on a Perkin Elmer ICP-OES Optima 7300 DV, and the samples were fully digested in a microwave oven before testing. N2 physical adsorption was carried out on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume was determined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure (p/p0 ) of 0.99. The average mesopore size was calculated based on the adsorption curve by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, and the micropore size was derived from the Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) method [17]. H2-TPR was tested on a 200-mg sample in a quartz U-tube on an Altamira Instruments AMI-300 with a thermal conductivity detection (TCD) device and an OmniStar GSD320 mass spectrometer. H2-TPR experiment was performed from 30°C to 320°C at a ramping rate of 5°C/min in a 10% H2/Ar flow. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The samples were pressed onto specified conductive adhesive tape for testing. A monochromatic X-ray source of Al Kα of 15kV was applied and the charging effect was adjusted according to the standard C1s binding energy of 284.6 eV[18]. The background spectra were subtracted using the Shirley-type baseline. TEM and HR-TEM were conducted with a JEM-2100 electron microscope operating at 200kV. The samples were pretreated by ultrasonic dispersion in ethanol, and then dropped onto nickel grids. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalyst samples were tested with Cu K α1 radiation on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer at 40kV and 40mA. 2.4 Glycerol oxidation reaction The glycerol oxidation reaction was carried out in a 100mL three-neck flask at atmospheric pressure in an oil bath. Glycerol solution (25.0g, 10wt%), LiOH (1.90g) and catalyst (0.25g) were mixed together and heated to 90°C in the reactor under constant stirring at 800 r/min with 100mL/min oxygen bubbling for 4h. After the reaction, the solution was filtered, neutralized with H2SO4 and diluted with deionized water. Then the products were analyzed by an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a refractive index detector (RID) and an Alltech OA-1000 column at 80°C. The mobile phase was a 0.005mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution and its flow rate was 0.5mL/min. All products were confirmed according to the same retention time with standard products from Aladdin, Sigma, Meryer, J&K and TCI. For easy comparison, we marked the salt products as their corresponding acids. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Texture properties of AC support and catalysts The N2 physical adsorption results obtained for the AC support, 1.0%Pt/AC, 1.0%Cu/AC and the copper modified 1.0%Pt/AC catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The specific surface area, pore volume and average meso-pore size of 1.0%Pt/AC and 1.0%Cu/AC catalyst were considerably smaller than those of the support. This may be owing to the partly blockage of the meso-pores by the deposited metal nanoparticles. Then the introduction of copper onto 1.0%Pt/AC had relatively small impact on the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the catalysts. For example, no significant distinction could be found between the 0.2%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC and the 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts. In addition, the micro-pores of all these catalysts were generally unchanged compared with the AC support, indicating that the metal species could not enter the micro-pores. 3.1.2 XPS results of catalysts X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to get the surface information of metal oxidation states and compositions of the 1.0%Pt/AC, 1.0%Cu/AC and xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0wt%). Fig. 1 a shows the Pt 4f spectra of 1.0%Pt/AC (sample F) and xCu-1.0%Pt/AC (sample A − E) catalysts. For sample F, the two doublet peaks at binding energy (BE) of 71.7eV and 75.0eV, ascribing to the Pt 4f7/2 and the Pt 4f5/2 states, indicated that the Pt species were presented in metallic form [19]. But its Pt 4f7/2 BE peak was at higher state than bulk Pt foil (71.1eV) [20], which may be because that the presence of small nanoparticles would cause apparent higher binding energy than the bulk material [21]. When Cu was introduced, the Pt 4f7/2 BE peak shifted slightly to a lower state of 71.5eV, and the increase in Cu loading led to BE peak shift to 71.6eV. It indicated that the presence of Cu would partly donate electrons to Pt through their mutual interactions, yet the donation was influenced at higher Cu loading. Fig. 1b depicts the Cu 2p spectra of 1.0%Cu/AC (sample G) and xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts (sample A − E). Compared with the monometallic 1%Cu/AC catalyst, the xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts exhibited lower BE peaks, with their Cu 2p3/2 peaks at 932.9eV and 931.9 − 932.6eV, respectively. This disagrees with previous discussion that Cu served as an electron donator for Pt. It may be because that the presence of Pt favored the NaBH4 reduction of Cu (Fig. S1). For bimetallic xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts, the deconvoluted BE peaks of low Cu-loading samples (A, B and C) were at 931.9 – 932.3eV, suggesting the presence of mere low valance Cu species (i.e. Cu+ and Cu0) [22]. Then the doublets gradually shifted to higher BE with the increase of Cu loading, which means that the overall states of Cu-species are getting higher. At high Cu loadings (sample D and E), the deconvoluted peaks at 934.5 − 934.6eV were also present, validating the presence of Cu2+ species [23]. The absence of the characteristic shake-up satellite peaks (938.8 – 946.2eV and 958.6 – 965.1eV) was another proof that Cu2+ species were not present when the content of copper was low (sample A, B and C) [24]. Meanwhile, these characteristic Cu2+ satellite peaks emerged at higher Cu loadings, revealing that their surface Cu2+ species were abundant. Given that Cu 2p spectra could not differentiate Cu0 from Cu+ species, Cu Auger L3VV spectra (Fig. 1c) were adopted to distinguish these Cu states [22]. For sample A and B, the little BE peaks at around 568.0eV indicated the existence of Cu0 species. For sample D, E and G, the BE peaks at around 569.5eV indicated the existence of Cu+ species [23]. And Fig. 1b suggested the presence of Cu2+ in D, E and G, whose Auger peaks might be overlapped by Cu+. As for sample C, its little Auger spectra was in the middle of two typical positions, i.e. positions of Cu+ species (569.5eV) and Cu0 species (568.0eV), implying the possible combination of both types [22]. The Pt/Cu molar ratios determined by ICP and XPS data are demonstrated in Table 2 . The ICP data represents the bulk Pt/Cu ratios, and the XPS data reveals the surface ratios. The bulk and surface Pt/Cu molar ratios show evident difference. Cu was enriched on the catalyst surface at 0.1 − 1.0% Cu loadings. And the ratio gap narrowed down with the increase of Cu loading. At Cu loading of 2.0%, slight Pt enrichment was observed (even so, surface Pt ratio was in minority). 3.1.3 H2-TPR of AC support and catalysts The H2 reduction profiles of AC support, 1.0%Pt/AC, 1.0%Cu/AC and bimetallic xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2 . The TPR profile of AC support (sample H) indicates that the support itself would not consume hydrogen in this temperature range. The 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst (sample F) also consumed negligible hydrogen because that Pt had been reduced by NaBH4 during preparation. For 1.0%Cu/AC catalyst (sample G), one apparent peak at 134°C and one wide peak at 260°C were observed, which were ascribed to well dispersed CuO particles and Cu2O, respectively [25]. The TPR profiles of bimetallic catalysts are more complicated than monometallic ones, testifying the strong interactions between platinum and copper. For 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst (sample E), the major H2 consumption peaks were at 107°C and 161°C, with a wide shoulder peak at 255°C, corresponding to highly dispersed CuO, large CuO particles and Cu2O, respectively [25,26]. Similarly, the reduction of 1.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst (sample D) showed a major peak at 120°C and two wide shoulder peaks at 190°C and 250°C, attributing to well dispersed CuO, large CuO particles and Cu2O as well, except that its reduction peak for large CuO particles was almost flat. For both sample D and E, the reduction of dispersed CuO and Cu2O appeared at lower temperatures than 1.0%Cu/AC catalyst, which was favored by the active H spillover from Pt [27]. Because of the lower copper loading, Cu was better dispersed on sample D than sample E. Thus, on sample D the interaction between Cu and AC support would be stronger, and its reduction temperature was higher than sample E [28]. For 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC, 0.2%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC and 0.1%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC (denoted as sample C, B and A, respectively), the reduction peaks were in similar trend, with three successive peaks at around 155°C, 215°C and 260°C. These reduction temperatures were even higher than those of sample D. That may be explained by the even better Cu dispersion and the stronger Cu-support interaction. For sample C, the peak corresponding to Cu2O (at 262°C) stood out, validating that Cu+ species were in dominance. The TPR profiles of sample A and B were relatively flat, implying that they have less oxidized copper than sample D and E. This is in accordance with XPS analysis, where Cu0 species were the major state at low copper loading (0.1% and 0.2%). The slight rise at 258°C indicated the presence of small amount of Cu+ species. 3.1.4 TEM images of catalysts The TEM images of xCu-1.0%Pt/AC, 1.0%Pt/AC and 1.0%Cu/AC samples are presented in Fig. 3 . Since the dark spots of bimetallic catalysts could be Pt, Cu or their alloy, we collectively termed them as the Pt-Cu cluster. In order to investigate the Pt-Cu cluster dispersion, the nanoparticle size was statistically measured from the TEM micrograph by counting more than 200 particles. For xCu-1.0%Pt/AC samples, the average particle sizes were around 2.3 – 3.5nm, while for 1.0%Cu/AC and 1.0%Pt/AC catalysts, the average particle sizes were around 9.8nm and 4.2nm, respectively. Therefore, the Cu-promoted 1.0%Pt/AC catalysts showed better dispersion of metals than monometallic catalysts, which is in good agreement with XRD observations (Fig. S2). In other words, the existence of Cu prevents the aggregation of Pt fine particles and vice versa. Wei et al. attributed such inhibitions of aggregation to the strong interactions between Cu and noble metals [29]. HR-TEM images of sample C, F and G were shown in the right corner of their TEM images, demonstrating the respective characteristic lattice fringes of the bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. In sample F and G, characteristic patterns of Pt (111) planes (d=2.27Å) (JCPDS, 00-004-0802) and Cu (111) planes (d=2.08Å) (JCPDS, 01-085-1326) were observed, respectively. In sample C, the Pt (111) and Cu (111) planes were detected to coexist with each other by connecting one of the planes together. For other Cu-promoted 1.0%Pt/AC samples (sample A − E, except for C), such coexistence was rarely detected, indicating that the formation of Pt-Cu interface was limited. There was also possibility that the current HR-TEM resolution was not sufficient to detect such coexistence lattice fringes on smaller particles, since the clear lattice fringes were generally acquired on particles of around 9nm, which were in the minority of their particle distributions. 3.2 Results of glycerol selective oxidation 3.2.1 Effect of copper loading on the catalytic performance Table 3 shows the results of glycerol oxidation over 1.0%Pt/AC and xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts, whereas 1.0%Cu/AC catalyst was inactive under our conditions (not shown here). Considering that the Pt loadings of above catalysts determined by ICP data (Table S1) were all around 0.95% and their metal particle dispersions determined by TEM (Fig. 3) were comparable, the variation trend of their respective activities represented by TOF number or glycerol conversion would be similar. Then we focused our discussion on glycerol conversion, and provided the TOF numbers as references. The 1.0%Pt/AC converted 40.6% glycerol with 56.6% selectivity of LA within 4h. When 0.1% Cu was added, the glycerol conversion was improved to 43.7% along with LA selectivity of 65.9%. Increasing Cu loading to 0.2%, the glycerol conversion was further elevated to 52.7% with little rise in LA selectivity. At Cu loading of 0.35%, glycerol conversion reached 68.2% with LA selectivity of 72.9%. Then the glycerol conversion was significantly raised to 80.0% and the LA selectivity dropped slightly to 69.3% when Cu loading was elevated to 0.5%. Continued addition in Cu content led to declines in both glycerol conversion and LA selectivity. For instance, for 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst, the glycerol conversion dropped rapidly to 42.8% and LA selectivity to 49.0%, but GLYA selectivity rose notably (27.5%). In terms of GLYA selectivity, it generally increased with the increase of Cu loading, which may be related with the enhanced catalytic ability for further oxidation. Therefore, the optimum copper loading is 0.5% under our reaction conditions. 3.2.2 The reusability of 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst The recycling experiments were carried out to evaluate the reusability of the 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst. After each run, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed with deionized water. Then the catalyst was dried at room temperature and used in the next run. As shown in Fig. 4 , the glycerol conversion maintained stable with the three successive glycerol conversion at 81.0%, 78.2% and 80.0%, respectively; their respective LA selectivity was at around 68%. Subsequently, the recovered catalyst was examined using TEM and ICP analyses. TEM images showed that the distribution of the Pt-Cu clusters were not significantly altered with the average size at 3.3nm (Fig. S3). ICP revealed that no Pt species were detected in the filtered reaction solution, suggesting that no Pt leaching occurred; the Cu species were detected leaching by 1.3%. These results corroborate that the 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst has a satisfactory reusability in glycerol oxidation reaction under our conditions. 3.3 Discussion The role of Cu is demonstrated through the testing of 1.0%Pt/AC, 1.0%Cu/AC and xCu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts in glycerol oxidation (Section 3.2.1). 1.0%Cu/AC could not convert glycerol under our reaction conditions, whereas 1.0%Pt/AC converted over 40% glycerol within 4h. Thus, Cu mainly acts as a promotor in this reaction. According to N2 physical adsorption analysis, the Cu-promoted 1.0%Pt/AC catalysts had similar specific surface area, pore volume and pore size with the un-promoted one. Therefore, the improved catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts might be attributed to the mutual effects between Pt and Cu rather than the limited variations in surface areas and porous structures. Based on XPS analysis (Fig. 1), the surface Pt/Cu molar ratio was different from the bulk ratio, i.e., the segregation effect occurred (Table 2). These bimetallic Cu-Pt catalysts all performed better than monometallic 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst (Table 3), regardless of whether surface Pt or Cu enrichment occurred. Therefore, the collaboration between Pt and Cu plays vital roles in improving the catalyst performance. Given that the reactions take place at the surface of the active sites, a proper surface Pt/Cu molar ratio would be important. In our case, the desirable surface Pt/Cu molar ratio was ca. 0.62 of the 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst. Although the 1.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst had a similar surface Pt/Cu molar ratio of 0.57, it showed apparently lower glycerol conversion and slightly lower LA selectivity (Table 3, entry 5 and 7). And their H2-TPR profiles are obviously different (Fig. 2), which indicates that the oxidation states of surface metals are also crucial for the glycerol conversion and LA selectivity. Specifically, based on the results from XPS and H2-TPR, Cu+ species were abundant in 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC, whereas the Cu2+ species increased a lot in 1.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC and 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC. The glycerol conversion and LA selectivity of the latter ones decreased markedly. Therefore, the excellent performance of 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst is closely related with its surface Cu+ species; the lowered activity of the latter ones is related with their abundant Cu2+ species. In addition, the difference between TPR profiles of 1.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC and 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC shows that the increase of large CuO particles may further decrease glycerol conversion and result in higher GLYA selectivity (Table 3, entry 7 and 8). The role of Cu0 species could be demonstrated by comparisons among 1.0%Pt/AC, 0.1%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC and 0.2%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalysts, since the XPS data and H2-TPR profiles of the latter two catalysts validated that Cu was in metallic form. Their glycerol conversion and LA selectivity were fairly enhanced than 1.0%Pt/AC (Table 3, entry 1 − 3), proving that the Cu0 species were also beneficial. Therefore, the surface Cu species notably influence the catalyst activity in glycerol oxidation, which is in agreement with literatures on Cu-catalyzed glycerol hydrogenolysis reactions [25,31]. The introduction of Cu also notably improved the Pt-Cu cluster dispersion on the support and led to the formation of some Pt-Cu interfaces. The essential role of Pt in primary glycerol dehydrogenation has been widely accepted [32]. At the same time, the Pt sites have another important role, i.e. acting as a bridge between O2 and regenerated OH− ions via peroxide intermediate decomposition [33]. Our previous discussion have shown that monometallic 1.0%Cu/AC could not activate glycerol (Section 3.2.1). Then the improvement in Pt-Cu cluster dispersion would provide reactants more access to Pt sites. The partly formation of Pt-Cu interfaces also allowed the reaction to proceed more efficiently by reducing products binding to Pt surface and offering more sites for dehydrogenation and O2-splitting reactions, similar to Stamenkovic’s illustration [34]. As for higher loadings of Cu promoter (for example, 2.0%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC), large CuO particles might cover the Pt sites, and the surface Pt/Cu ratio was quite low (0.31). Then the reactants’ access toward Pt was insufficient, both dehydrogenation and OH− regeneration steps were limited, and the catalyst performance was deteriorated. Based on above discussion and previous literatures, we proposed a reaction mechanism in our catalyst system, as illustrated in Scheme 1 . The primary glycerol dehydrogenation step is assisted by the coordination of xCu-1.0%Pt/AC and LiOH to form glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone intermediates, followed by LiOH catalyzed dehydration and intramolecular Cannizzaro rearrangement of intermediates to LA [6,32]. These intermediates may also undergo consecutive oxidation to GLYA and GLYA oxidation to TA. In this study, the Cu promoted 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst is expected to promote the glycerol conversion by the interaction effect of Pt and Cu, including factors of proper Pt/Cu ratio, improved metal dispersion and formation of some Pt-Cu interfaces. Meanwhile, the presence of Cu+ and Cu0 has a positive effect on LA formation. However, high copper loading would lead to more Cu2+ species, which would lower the glycerol conversion. Further increase in Cu loading would favor large CuO particle formation, which would further decrease the conversion of glycerol (compared with other Cu-Pt/AC catalysts) and inhibit the formation of LA by favoring consecutive oxidation to GLYA. 4 Conclusions We disclosed that the Cu promoted 1.0%Pt/AC catalysts were effective for glycerol oxidation to produce LA under mild reaction conditions. The optimized 0.5%Cu-1.0%Pt/AC catalyst showed much higher glycerol conversion and LA selectivity than that of 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst. The existence of Cu species contributes to the uniform metal dispersion and the formation of some Pt-Cu interfaces; proper surface Pt/Cu molar ratio (0.62 in our case) and presence of Cu+ and Cu0 species also played vital roles in improving glycerol conversion and LA selectivity. But excess Cu2+ species would lower glycerol conversion and LA selectivity. The current understanding of the Cu promotion effect might also be applied in the selective oxidation of other polyols.

        "dc:description": "A series of copper-promoted platinum supported on activated carbon (Cu-Pt/AC) catalysts were investigated for glycerol oxidation to lactic acid. The catalytic performance of 1.0%Pt/AC catalyst was greatly influenced by Cu loading (0.1–2.0wt%). Among them, the 0.5%Cu–1.0%Pt/AC catalyst showed the best promotional effect, whose lactic acid yield was 2.4 times of that on 1.0%Pt/AC under same reaction conditions. Characterizations were carried out to explore the relationships between catalyst properties and reaction performances. TEM images show that the introduction of Cu improves the dispersion of Pt and Cu, and some Pt-Cu interfaces are detected by HR-TEM, which would facilitate the glycerol transformation. XPS and H2-TPR analyses reveal that good catalyst performance is related with not only a proper surface Pt/Cu molar ratio, but also copper species’ oxidation states. Cu+ and Cu0 species favor glycerol conversion and lactic acid production, whereas large CuO particles facilitate the formation of glyceric acid.",
