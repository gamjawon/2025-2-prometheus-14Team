SELECTIVE REDUCTION OF POLYCYCLIC COMPOUNDS* IBRAHIM AMER, HAMDULLAH AMER, RACHEL ASCHER, JOCHANAN BLUM** Department of Organic Chemistry, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904 (Israel) YOEL SASSON Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904 (Israel) and K. PETER C. VOLLHARDT Department of Chemistry, University of California, and the Materials and Molecular Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 (U.S.A.) (Received April 13, 1986; accepted August 25, 1986) Summary Acenaphthylene, fluorene, anthracene, phenanthrene, benz[a]an- thracene, pyrene, fluoranthene, benzo[c] phenanthrene and some of their derivatives were shown to undergo partial hydrogenation in the presence of the RhCl3-Aliquat 336 catalyst in a highly selective manner. Olefinic double bonds were found to be hydrogenated prior to aromatic moieties. In linear aromatic molecules, only the terminal rings are reduced. In phen- anthrene the C9 Cio bond and in pyrene the 05 linkage are the only ones to be affected. Benz [a] anthracene is converted exclusively into 7,8,9,- 10-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene. Benzo[c] phenanthrene is hydrogenated to give primarily the 5,6-dihydro derivative. Chlorine and bromine substituents were found to undergo hydrogenolysis when attached to the reacting moi- eties, but usually remain unaffected when located on non-reacting aromatic rings. Introduction Hydrogenation of poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been found to occur with certain homogeneous and heterogeneous transit25_ metal cata- lysts (see [2 -11]). In a few cases (e.g. [6]), the processes were reported to be highly selective and consequently of particular synthetic value. We found, *ForPart 2 see [1]. *' 'Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 186 however, that often these reductions are of low reproducibility as they depend strongly on the quality of the catalysts and frequently require more severe conditions than reported in the literature. We now wish to report that the hydrated ion pair [(CgH^NCHa]- [RhC^], which has already proved to be an efficient isomerization [12] and hydrogenation catalyst [13], promotes also regioselective partial hydrogena- tion of a variety of polycyclic aromatic compounds under exceedingly mild conditions. Experimental General procedure for catalytic hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic compounds A microhydrogenation apparatus described in our previous paper [1] was charged under nitrogen at 30 0.5 C with a mixture of 10 mg (3.79 X 10~2 mmol) of RhCl3-3H20 in 1 ml of triply distilled water, 22 mg (5.4 X 10~2 mmol) of Aliquat 336, 100 pi (0.23 mmol) of tri-n-octylamine and 1 mmol of the freshly chromatographed substrate in 0.5 - 8.5 ml of 1,2- dichloroethane (see Table 1). The nitrogen in the system was removed and replaced by 1 atm hydrogen. The progress of the reduction reaction was monitored both by the H; uptake and by periodic GC analysis of the reac- tion mixture. After the period given in Table 1, the hydrogenation was stopped, the organic layer separated, dried and filtered through alumina (pH = 4.5, activity I). The composition of the eluate was determined by GC-MS on a Hewlett Packard 5790 gas chromatograph equipped with a HP 5970A mass selective detector and a 25 m X 0.22 mm HP Ultra 1 cross- linked methyl silicone capillary column. Quantitative separation was carried out using a preparative column packed with 15% OV-17 on Chromosorb W. The NMR spectra of the different compounds were compared with those of authentic samples. New compounds obtained in this study were subjected to elemental analysis. The results obtained with 20 polycyclic aromatic substrates are sum- marized in Table 1, and selected NMR and MS data of the partially reduced products are listed in Table 2. 1 2 R = Cl 4 3R=H 5R=H 7 6R=C1 8R=H 9 R = CHa 10R=C1 11 R=Br 12R=H 13 R = CH3 14 R = Cl ^R-Br 16 R = OH 17 R = CHa 18R=C1 19 R = OH 24R=H 25 R = Cl 26 R = Br 27 28 29 R 32 33 34 R = H 36 35R=C1 188 37 38 39 40 41 TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of various aromatic polycyclic compounds in the presence of the RhCla- 3H20-Aliquat 336 system\" Substrate (volume of solvent, ml) Reaction time (h) Conversion (%) Products (yield, %)11 1(1) 4 100 3(100) 2(1) 72 90 3 (92); 4 [14] (8) 3(1) 72 82 4(100) 5(1) 72 19 7 [15] (100) 6(1) 72 37 5 (51); 7 (42) 8(6) 30 20 12 [16] (100) 9(1) 72 52 13 [17] (100) 10(1) 24 100 14'1 (100)*' 11(2) 76 95 15 [18] (100) 20(3) 48 72 16 [19] (89);19 [19] (11) 21(8.5) 264 100 22^88); 23 (12) 24(0.5) 1446 1 27(100) 25(1) 75 19 24 (89); 27 (8) 26 (0.5) 36 37 24 (95); 27 (5) 28(1) 90 84 24 (10); 27 (24); 29 [20](60) 30(3) 48 95 31 [6] (100) 32(1) 122 28 33 [6] (100) 34(1) 1686 19 36 [21](84)11 35(3) 144 50 34 (90); 36 (10) 37(1) 72 54 38 [22] (62); 39 [23] (21) 40 [24] (11);W(5) \"Reaction conditions: 1 mmol substrate, 3.79 X 10 2 mmol RhCla^H^O in 1 ml triply distilled water, 5.4 X 10~2 mmol Aliquat 336, 0.23 mmol tri-n-octylamine in the indicated volume of 1,2-dichloroethane; hydrogen pressure 1 atm; T = 30 0.5 C. bThe references given are those according to which authentic samples have been prepared.

Table 1 indicates that the various polycyclic aromatics not only differ in their reactivities but also afford different types of hydroaromatic products depending on the structural constraints of the substrates. Olefinic bonds present in the aromatic substrates are always the first to be hydrogenated. Thus, e.g., indene is initially converted in quantitative yield into indane, and acenaphthylene (1) gives acenaphthene (3) prior to its conversion into the hexahydro compound (4). Polycyclics that are composed of linearly fused aromatic rings are hydrogenated exclusively at the terminal rings, indicating kinetic control of the course of the reaction. For example, anthracene (8) is transformed at first entirely to the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-derivative (12), while further reduction gives 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroanthracene. In this respect, our anthracene hydrogenation differs from most other reported homogeneous processes in which 9,10-dihydroanthracene is formed either as the sole or the main product (see e.g. [5]). The refractory behavior of the central ring towards H2 in the presence of the rhodium catalyst could be demonstrated by introduction of a hydrolyzable group at the 9 position. While the chlorine atoms in chlorobenzene [13] and chloronaphthalene [I], as well as in 5- chloroacenaphthene (2) and 4-chlorofluorene (6), are eliminated mostly prior to the saturation of the aromatic rings, the halogen atoms in 9-chloro- and 9-bromo-anthracene (10, 11, respectively) are completely retained during reduction to the corresponding tetrahydro-compounds 14 and 15. Even upon prolonged treatment with hydrogen that leads to the reduction of both terminal rings, no elimination of the halogen atom takes place. 9-Chloroanthracene (10) can therefore be converted into the pure octa- hydro derivative, 18. Chlorine and bromine on the terminal rings are, of course, hydro- genolyzed. Fluorine, however, resists hydrogenation (cf. the conversion of fluoro benzene into fluorocyclohexane [13]), but its presence causes some reduction also at the meso positions: 2-fluoroanthracene (21) yields, in addition to 22, also 2-fluoro-9,10-dihydroanthracene (23) as a minor prod- uct. 9-Anthrone reacts as the enol tautomer to give 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- anthracen-9-ol (16) in the first stage, and the octahydro derivative 19 upon further hydrogenation. In contrast to anthracenes, phenanthrene derivatives are hardly affected at their terminal rings. Phenanthrene (24) itself forms no 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro compound, but is reduced extremely slowly (1% in 144 h) at the 9,10-posi- tions. We attribute this behavior to the steric constraints of the nearly over- lapping hydrogen atoms of the bay region (64 and 65). Halogen substituents enhance the rate of hydrogenation of phenanthrene. However, as the reac- 193 tion takes place at and Cio, the 9-chloro- and 9-bromo-compounds (25, 26) give only the halogen-free products 24 and 27. On the other hand, the halogen in 3-chlorophenanthrene (28), which is attached to a nonreact- ing ring, is therefore affected only slightly during the hydrogenation process, and 3-chloro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (29) is the main reaction product. The difference in the reactivity between the linear and angular terminal rings can be observed also during the reaction of benz[a]anthracene (30). This compound gives exclusively 8,9,10,ll-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene (31) and cannot be hydrogenated further under our standard reaction con- ditions. As in phenanthrene, no reaction takes place at the 1, 2 and 3 positions of pyrene (32). The 04 Cg bond is the only one to be reduced. Benzo[c] phenanthrene (37), which can be regarded formally as a combination of two overlapping phenanthrene molecules, forms, as ex- pected, 5,6-dihydrobenzo[c] phenanthrene (38) as the chief primary prod- uct. However, in this system some further hydrogenation already starts before complete consumption of the starting material to give 1,2,3,4,7,8- and cis-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[c] phenanthrene (39 and 40 respec- tively). Both the major secondary product 39 and the minor one 40, still absorb hydrogen and yield twoisomericdodecahydrobenzo[c]phenanthrenes (41) (separated by GC-MS). It is notable that although 38 contains one isolated benzene ring and one naphthalene structure, the hydrogenation of this compound takes place only at one of the naphthalene rings. The main process occurs on the 'non- substituted' naphthalene ring, as one could predict from the results of our previous studies [1]. A similar difference between the reactivity of a benzene and a naph- thalene moiety in a polycyclic molecule is found in the hydrogenations of fluoranthene (34) and 3-chlorofluoranthene (35), which give the l,2,3,10b- tetrahydro compound (36) rather than the 6b,7,8,9,10,10a-hexahydro derivative. Finally, the high stereoselectivity in the formation of two fused hydro- aromatic rings should be noted. Both in the reduction of fluorene (5) to l,2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydrofluorene and in the generation of 40 from 38, the CIS-fused structures are the only ones formed.
