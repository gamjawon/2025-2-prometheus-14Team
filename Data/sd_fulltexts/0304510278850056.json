University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo (Japan) (Received October 5, 1976; in revised form May 20, 1977) Summary Organic quinone polymers containing sulphonic acid functional groups, combined with palladium ion, gave heterogeneous oxidation catalysts which are effective for the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde. Two forms of the resins, soluble or insoluble in water, were made by use of different networks of cross-linked polymers- Both polymer-anchored palladium catalysts showed stable activities for the ethylene oxidation without any co-catalyst such as CuC12. The rates and reaction kinetics to form acetaldehyde were determined. The effect of the combination of Pd(II) with polyquinone on the catalytic reaction, and a comparison of the anchored catalysts with a homogeneous catalyst PdC12 CUC12 are discussed. Introduction Although several transition metal complexes have been found to be highly selective homogeneous catalysts, the application of these systems has been limited by the expense of catalyst recovery. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the preparation of polymeric analogs of known homogeneous catalysts in the hope that these compounds are solids and yet retain the catalytic activity of the homogeneous catalysts [1] . Polymers containing rhodium complexes have been shown to be effective catalysts for hydrogenation and hydroformylation [2] _ In the work reported in this paper, organic polymers containing quinone and sulphonic acid functional groups were prepared from benzidine -2,2' disulphonic acid or 4,4'-diaminostilbene -2,2' disulphonic acid and quinone [3] . Palladium was attached to these polymers by ion-exchanging the sulphonic sodium ions with [Pd(NH3)4] C12. The resulting compounds were found to be catalysts for the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde without the need of the co-catalyst of CuC12. 428 Results and Discussion Benzoquinone has been used to reoxidize reduced palladium to palladium(II) in ethylene oxidation reactions- To compare with the polymeric palladium-quinone catalyst, we have evaluated the behavior of a monomeric palladium-benzoquinone ca`Lalyst under identical conditions. With this catalyst the amount of acetaldehyde, formed in 5 h was almost 28% of the sum of the palladium ion (0.50 mmol) and benzoquinone (9.26 mmol) and the rate decreased rapidly as shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that palladium(O) can be reoxidized back to palladium(II), since this amount of acetaldehyde produced represents five palladium turnovers. However, the drastic decrease in rate indicates that the hydroquinone generated could not be reoxidized to benzoquinone by molecular oxygen under these conditions and, thus, the reaction is not catalytic in benzoquinone. Also for comparison, we evaluated a catalyst comprised of palladium ion supported on a cation exchange resin containing no quinone group. In this case, the amount of acetaldehyde produced was almost equal to the amount of palladium used, which indicates that the combination of palladium ion and quinone groups in the polymer is a necessary requisite for a catalytic reaction. However, it should be noted that Haag and Whitehurst have reported that PdC12 on Amberlite catalyzed the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde [4] . Four kinds of polymers, soluble poly(2,2'-disulphobiphenylene benzoquinone) (AS), insoluble poly(2,2'-disulphobiphenylene benzoquinone) (AI), soluble poly(2,2'-disulphostilbenylene benzoquinone) (BS), and insoluble poly(2,2'-disulphostilbenylene benzoquinone) (BI) were synthesized, and the structures are shown in Table I. The palladium ion-exchanged polymers containing quinone groups have catalytic activity for ethylene oxidation to give only acetaldehyde and no other product. These polymer-anchored palladium ion complexes are concluded to be catalysts from the following evidence. 5 Q 0 O 1. 2 3 R S o REACTION TIME (h ) 7 Fig- I_ Fate of acetaldehyde formation vs hours on stream- o, Catalyst AS; 4P, PdCl2benzoquinone; o, Pd-ion-exchanged resin, temperature 80 C, W/F 13.5 g cat/mol, total pressure of reed gas I atm.; mole ratio ethylene:oxygen = 1.I.

The yield of acetaldehyde is equal to the amount of the palladium ion on the resin. (2) The activity was maintained for over seven hours as shown in Fig. 1. (3) The amount of acetaldehyde formation is several times more than the sum of the amount, of palladium ion and benzoquinone group, as shown in Table 2. (4) When the oxygen feed stopped, acetaldehyde formation decreased rapidly, and after the oxygen feed began the oxidation activity was restored, as shown in Fig. 2. (5) The rate of acetaldehyde formation depends on the partial pressure of oxygen. These facts show that oxidation by palladium ion-exchanged polymer containing quinone groups is a catalytic reaction. 430 TABLE 2 Catalytic activity* Support Pd Q** Rate (X ILO -4 mol/g cat h)Turnover (h-1) (mmol/g cat) (Ool/g cat) initial averages*- Pd Q AI 0.42 0_9 2-8 2.3 (30 h) 0.54 0.25 AS 0.49 2-4 4.8 3.0 (15 h) 0.61 0.13 BI _ 0.38 0.8 2.1 1.6 (25 h) 0.42 0.20 BS 0-50 2-0 12.0 8.0 (24 h) 1.6 0.40 Ion exchanged' polymer 1.17 - 0.7 - - - Quinone't, 0.50 9.26 17.0 - - - *Reaction conditions: Temperature, 80 C; total pressure, I atm; feed ratio, C2H4:02 = I:1; total flow rate = 7-4 X IO 2 mol/h. **Quinone group***The rates are the average of the reaction time indicated in the parentheses except initial 3 h.

Palladium ion and palladium metal were not detected in the solution during and after reaction as determined by atomic absorption analysis of the filtrate. This shows that the palladium was anchored strongly to the functional groups of polymers. These polymers are semi-conductors, and as reported by Dulov et a1. [5] , an electron may transfer through the conjugated polymer from palladium(O) to quinone to form the active palladium ion (11). Palladium(II) catalyzes the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde. The presence of quinone groups as co-catalysts in the polymer oxidized 431 palladium(O) back to palladium(II) and kept the process continuous. The hydroquinone in the polymer was reoxidized by molecular oxygen back to the quinone in reaction (3)- o- Pd(0) + 15- c-- Pd(II) + O O + zH+ (2) O OH ox 1 (3) + 2 OZ ~ + HZO OH O The reaction rates for acetaldehyde formation at 80 C in these four catalysts were measured with varying partial pressures of oxygen and ethylene, using nitrogen as the diluent. The rates of acetaldehyde formation for the insoluble catalysts (AI and BI) were of the order 0.50 with respect to ethylene, while the rates for the soluble catalyst (AS and BS) were of the order 0.67_ The rates of acetaldehyde formation for the insoluble catalysts were of the order 0.62 with respect to oxygen, while the rates for the soluble catalysts were first order- In the case of the insoluble catalysts, the analysis of the kinetics is very difficult due to the effect of pore diffusion. With soluble monomeric palladium catalysts the rate of reaction of quinone with Pd(0) to Pd(II) is fast relative to the reaction of ethylene with .eater and Pd(II). If this holds for our polymeric catalysts the kinetics and quinone turnover numbers in Table 2 suggest that reoxidation of hydroquinone to quinone may actually be the rate-determining step in the ethylene oxidation, since the reaction rate shows less than a first-order dependence on the partial pressure of ethylene, and the turnover numbers of palladium show more than those of quinone on these four catalysts. The rate of acetaldehyde formation increased as the temperature was raised from 30 to 90 C, and the activation energy was 7.6 kcal/mol for Catalyst BI and 8.7 kcal/mol for Catalyst BS. It is possible that the insoluble anchored catalysts could be similar to the soluble anchored one- The distinction between the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts has not been clearly defined in the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde. Experimental Polymer syntheses Poly(2,2'-disulphobiphenylene) [AS] (Q:A = 1:1) [3] 6.88 g benzidine 2,2'-disulphonic acid benzoquinone were dissolved with heating in 40 ml aqueous solution of 2.12 g sodium carbonate. 10 ml 432 hydrochloric acid was added (d = 1.19), the solution was cooled to 0 C and 11 ml aqueous solution of NaN-02 (20%) added dropwise with cooling; mixing was continued for 3 h at room temperature. The insoluble diazo compound was separated by filtration, and mixed with a saturated solution of 8 g sodium acetate. 2.16 g quinone in 80 ml methanol was added to the solution at 25 C with vigorous stirring and mixing was continued for 10 h. The reaction solution was filtered, hydrochloric acid (d = IL-19) added to the filtrate, and the insoluble material separated by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated at 25 C. The condensed filtrate was added slowly to ethyl alcohol to obtain a precipitate. It was reprecipitated from absolute ethyl alcohol by glacial acetic acid and then twice from absolute ethyl alcohol by benzene. The polymer was dried under vacuum at 25 C- 5.1 g of dry soluble product was obtained. The insoluble residue in the filter was washed in hydrochloric acid (d = 1.19), water and alcohol, and dried under vacuum at 25 C. Crosslfnked poly(2,2'-disulphobiphenylene benzoquinone) [AI] (Q-A = 1=3) Except for the ingredient ratio of quinone and the acid, the synthesis was as before. Using 2.16 g quinone and 20-64 g benzidine 2,2'-disulphonic acid, 10-1 g of insoluble product was obtained. Poly(2,2'-disulphostilbenylene benzoquinone) [BS] (Q:A = 1:1) The synthesis and separation of this polymer were the same as for AS. From 2.16 g quinone and 7-4 g 4,4'-diaminostilbene 2,2'-disulphonic acid, 14.5 g of soluble and 0.8 g of insoluble polymer were obtained- Crosslinked poly (2,2'-disulphostilbenylene benzoquinone) [BI] (Q: A = 1= 3) Except for the ingredient ratio of quinone and acid, the synthesis and separation were the same as for AS- From 2.16 g quinone and 22.2 g 4,4'diaminostilbene 2,2'-disulphonic acid, 11.5 g of insoluble polymer were prepared- Immobilized catalyst preparation Insoluble catalysts A given amount of an aqueous solution of 0.01 N [Pd(NH3)4] C12 was added dropwise to the above polymer. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 days. The ion-exchanged polymer was obtained by filtration and washed with distilled water until the washing gave a negative test for chloride anion. The solid was evacuated at 150 C for 4 h in order to remove ammonia.

Soluble catalysts The soluble polymers were dissolved in aqueous [Pd(NH3)4l Clz solution and ammonia was removed by heating at 90 C to give the homogeneous system. Palladium ion-exchanged polymer (Pd 0_30 mmol/g cat) A commercial cationized resin (Amberlite IR-120) was used as the ionexchanged polymer. The same method of the immobilized catalyst preparation was adopted in the ion-exchange of the polymer. Palladium-benzoquinone system Palladium chloride (0.50 mmol) was dissolved in the benzoquinone (9.26 mmol) solution. Reaction procedure The reactor was a vertical tube 20 mm in diameter and 45 cm long. In general, I g of catalyst (the palladium content of each catalyst is listed in 434 Table 2) was suspended in a 1 _N HC1 solution in the reactor. The whole suspension was maintained at the desired reaction temperature by the use of a heating tape around the reactor. The soluble catalyst was dissolved in the solution of the same concentration. The solution was then heated with continuous agitation by the inlet gases. The reactor exit tube and vapor-sampling valve were heated to prevent condensation of product vapors. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography on a 2 m column of PEG 500 for acetaldehyde and a 3 m Si02 column to confirm the absence of carbon dioxide.
