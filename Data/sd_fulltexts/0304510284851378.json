P. J. VERLAAN, P. J. T. ALFERINK and G. CHALLA Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry, State University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 16, 9747 AG Groningen (The Netherlands) (Received July 11, 1983) Summary To improve the process of oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP) to polyphenyleneoxide (PPO) with homogeneous soluble copper catalysts, a new type of ligand for the copper complexation was tested, viz. 4-disubstituted aminopyridine (I). Under comparable mild reaction condi- tions the new catalysts were able to transfer DMP within a short reaction period and with very good specificity to high molecular weight PPO. These ligands were bound to linear, partially chloromethylated, polystyrene in order to increase the re-oxidation rate of the catalyst in the nonpolar environment created by the polystyrene matrix. The intrinsic activities of the macromolecular catalysts, expressed as the rate-determining rate constant, k-i, was increased up to 0.14 s\"1, which is a thirty-five-fold increase compared to the low-molar mass catalysts based on pyridine. Introduction The oxidative coupling of 2,6-disubstituted phenols, catalyzed by homogeneous copper amine complexes yielding C C and/or C 0 coupled products (Scheme 1), is not only an important industrial process, but it is also of scientific interest. Poly-2,6-dimethyl-l,4-phenyleneoxide (PPO), when R=CH3, is a very serviceable engineering plastic with outstanding properties. Since Hay's discovery [1] many investigations have been performed to improve this process. Since then, the catalytic behaviour of a number of metal complexes has been tested. At slightly elevated temperature and under certain strict reaction conditions, copper complexes of substituted 1,2-diaminoethanes are known to be the best catalysts for the production of high molecular weight PPO with good yields [2, 3]. Soluble copper catalysts have been used in nearly all experiments involving oxidative coupling of phenols, but in such reactions the lifetime of the catalyst is considerably limited due to water production. There are two possibilities to improve the utility of the catalyst. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 236 y^^ ^..i 1 ^ catalyst m <0)-OH + Y IT) 0^ Scheme 1. The first possibility is the anchoring of the known catalysts on a support in order to separate the catalyst after reaction and make its re-use possible. This subject has been thoroughly explored by anchoring complete linear macromolecular ligands for copper complexation to an inert support [4-6]. In the oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, this resulted in complete preservation of activity after the nondestructive separation of the anchored catalyst. The intrinsic activity of the anchored catalyst was identical to that of the unbound macromolecular catalyst [4]. The second possibility is to improve the intrinsic activity and stability of the homogeneous copper catalyst by synthesizing new copper complexes. We wish to report here a new type of basic ligand for this copper complexa- tion, viz. 4-disubstituted aminopyridines (I), which are already known as acetylation catalysts with very high activities [7-9]. Ri--N R,2 RI = CHa, Ri = CHs or polymer, Riand Ri = (CH2)4 (I) To further improve the catalytic acetylation properties, the anchorage of these 4-disubstituted aminopyridines has recently been the subject of several investigations [10-13]. We studied the activities of some copper complexes of (I) to compare several types of ligands in the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP) and performed a kinetic analysis of the results. It is known from earlier investigations that the oxidative coupling of phenols with polymer-copper complexes can be described by the Michaelis- Menten concept [14] (Scheme 2), where E and E* stand for Cu(II) and Cu(I) complex respectively, S for substrate (DMP) and P for product (DPQ or PPO). Normally k^< fereox and therefore ft 2ls tne rate-determining step in the redox cycle. The copper amine complex for oxidative coupling reactions can be prepared starting either from CuCl in the presence ofdioxygen, amines 237 H-tO 0-i Scheme 2. and moisture or from CuC\\i'2ii^O, amines and a stoichiometric amount of potassium hydroxide [15]. Experimental Synthesis of poly styrene-co-4-(N-methyl-N-p-vinylbenzyl)aminopyridine Partially chloromethylated polystyrene was prepared either by the Galeazzi method [16] or by copolymerization of styrene and vinylbenzyl chloride [17]. Before use the monomers were distilled under reduced nitrogen pressure. The degree of functionalization, a (= mole fraction functional group in copolymer), was determined by elemental analysis (C, H, Cl) and was chosen between 0.05 and 0.25. The My of the starting polystyrene was determined in chloroform at 25 C with the Ubbelohde technique, and was approximately 40 000. Preparation of 4-(2V-methylamino)- pyridine and subsequent coupling to chloromethylated polystyrene was performed according to Tomoi [13] (Scheme 3). The polymer was precipi- [@N-<gN-^Cl,.

The white polymer was characterized by IR and elemental analyses (C,H,N,(C1)). Oxidatiue coupling The catalyst was prepared m situ. Copper(II) chloride was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene/methanol, amine was added, the reaction mixture was shaken and saturated with dioxygen in a thermostatted bath. After adding the substrate (2,6-dimethylphenol) the oxidative coupling was started by adding the appropriate amount of potassium hydroxide in methanoi. The dioxygen consumption rate was measured with an automatic isobaric gas burette. Reaction rates were calculated from the initial dioxygen consump- tion rates. At the end of the reaction, PPO was isolated by precipitation in an excess of acidified methanoi. PPO was filtered, washed with methanoi, dried under vacuum at 60 C and characterized by IR and elemental analysis (CgHgO) ; found (calculated): C: 78.0% (80.0%); H: 6.6% (6.7%). The intrinsic viscosity, [17], was determined by the Ubbelohde technique in chloroform at 25 C. The following standard reaction conditions were chosen: total reaction volume 0.015 dm3, T =298.16 K, solvent mixture: l,2-dichlorobenzene methanoi = 13:2 (v/v); [Cu2\"1'] = 3.32 mmol dm\"3; [phenol] = 0.06 mol dm-3; [ligand]: [Cu^] = 2, [OH-] = [Cu24'], Po = 101.3 kPa. Results and discussion In Fig. l, initial reaction rates are shown as a function of the amine-to- copper ratio. For all catalysts, C 0 coupling is favoured with an increasing amine-to-copper ratio. In general this effect can be attributed to an enhance- ment in basicity [18]. The observed reaction rates, in the case of 4-dimethyl- aminopyridine (DMAP) (a) or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine (PP) ( ) as ligand, are much higher compared to l,2-bis(dimethylamino)ethane (TMED) (o), or to pyridine-containing copper catalysts ( ) under the present standard condi- tions, which are not optimal for TMED. High reaction rates are also observed for the polymer-bound aminopyridine (A). The sequence of increasing reaction rates (going from pyridine to PP) is exactly the same asthat observed in acetylation catalysis [8]. In Table 1, several catalytic experiments are shown for different low molar mass amine ligands under comparable reaction conditions. The reaction product was isolated and characterized. In the case of PP as ligand, the PPO was obtained in 90% yield as a bright white powder. The intrinsic viscosity, [i}], amounts to 56 ml g-1, which corresponds to My = 61 000 (calculated using the Mark-Houwink relation, with K = 4.83 X 10-2 ml g~1 and a = 0.64 in chloroform at 25 C [19].

It is clearly demonstrated that under mild reaction conditions the new catalyst is able to transfer DMP in good yields, within a short reaction period and with good specificity to high-molecular-weight PPO. To investigate why these 4-aminopyridine catalysts do show such high reaction rates with high specificity, a kinetic analysis was carried out. The 240 Fig. 2. The dioxygen consumption rate R as a function of the catalyst concentration for DMAP as ligand under standard conditions (see experimental). reaction is first-order in catalyst concentration as shown for DMAP as ligand (Fig. 2). The reaction rates for these low molar mass catalysts were dependent on the dioxygen pressure, indicating that we are probably measuring reoxida- tion rates of Cu(I) to Cu(II) (fereox i\" Scheme 2) instead of oxidation of phenol. This was found earlier for low molar mass imidazole copper com- plexes [20]. Dioxygen-dependent measurements with the DMAP catalyst and DMP under standard conditions (see experimental) point to a Michaelis- Menten mechanism (Scheme 4). A so-called Lineweaver-Burk plot of the reciprocal dioxygen pressure against the reciprocal reaction rate yields a feyeox equal to 0.08 s\"' (Fig. 3). Thus the oxidation rate constant k^ must be at least as large as, or larger than, this fereox' but cannot be determined separately. fe'! ^reox E* + 02 i==i E*0i > E + HiO k'-1 Scheme 4. Polymer-bound 4-aminopyridines were synthesized with different degrees of functionalization, a, (= mole fraction 4-aminopyridine in the macromolecule) starting from the nonpolar polystyrene. After complexation with copper(II) chloride and the addition of the proper amount of methanolic potassium hydroxide, the catalytic 'activity of these macromolecular copper complexes were tested with DMP as a substrate. Variation in dioxygen pressure from 70 to 125 kPa with these macro- molecular catalysts did not alter the reaction rate, which is in sharp contrast to the results shown in Fig. 3 for the low molar mass analogue. Anchorage of ligands to a nonpolar polymer very often results in an enhancement of reoxidation rates of redox copper catalysts fixed along these macromolecules 241 Fig. 3. Lineweaver-Burk plot of dioxygen pressure-dependent measurements for a low molar mass DMAP catalyst under standard conditions (see experimental). [20,21]. Obviously we are no longer measuring reoxidation rates from Cu(I) to Cu(II) but real phenol oxidation rates, as shown in Scheme 2. In order to obtain values of fez, a further kinetic analysis was performed. A first-order dependence in catalyst concentration is found for these macro- molecular catalysts. Substrate concentration-dependent measurements are shown as a Lineweaver-Burk plot in Fig. 4. The values for &; and K^ = Fig. 4.

(fei)/(fe--i + fez) ^oi polymeric catalysts with different a's are summarized in Table 2. The binding of these ligands to a nonpolar polymer results in an enhancement of fereox since we now observe k^ values up to 0.14 s\"1 and the value of fereox fo1' these catalysts must be at least equal to this value. This is in agreement with earlier results [20]. The intrinsic activity of these macro- molecular catalysts is shown to be independent of a within the range of experimental error. The observed increase in activity going from pyridine or TMED-like catalysts to 4-aminosubstituted pyridine-containing catalysts can partly be attributed to an enhancement in basicity of the applied ligands, which favours phenolate ion formation. Moreover, the electron-donating properties of the ligands are improved (resonance stabilization) in the same order. This leads to a higher electron density on the planar copper(II) catalyst itself and favours deformation of the geometry around copper. The rate-determining step in the electron-transfer process between 'phenol' and copper seems to be a configurational change, from planar Cu2\"1\" to tetrahedral Cu\"*\" [22, 23]. Thus, due to this ligand effect the catalyst-substrate complex may slightly distort in the direction of the transition state. The rate-determining rate constants, k-^, were determined by substrate concentration-dependent measurements as mentioned before. With pyridine as ligand, fe; = 0.004 s~1 and for polystyrene-co-4-vinylpyridine fe; = 0.015 s~1 [23], while polymer-bound 4-aminopyridine catalysts show values up to 0.14 s~1. Consequently, the observed higher reaction rates obtained with the new polymeric catalysts can be attributed to an increase in k^, caused by the increase in electron-donating properties of these ligands. Although the soluble macromolecular catalysts do have fairly high activities for coupling, they cannot be used to synthesize high purity PPO. To ease the separation of the macromolecular catalysts, anchorage of these complete macromolecular catalysts on an inert support is required, and will be the subject of forthcoming studies. 243 Conclusions Copper complexes of(macromolecular) 4-disubstituted aminopyridines are good catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol. The kinetics of oxidative coupling with macromolecular aminopyridine catalysts is quite normal and can be described by the Michaelis-Menten scheme. The reoxidation rate constants of the macromolecular catalysts are increased in comparison with those found for the low molar mass analogues. The intrinsic activity of the catalysts is very high compared to known catalysts. References 1 A. S. Hay, H. S. Blanchard, G. F. Endres and J. W. Eustance, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 81 (1959)6335. 2 A. S.

The intrinsic activities of the macromolecular catalysts, expressed as the rate-determining rate constant, k 2, was increased up to 0.14 s−, which is a thirty-five-fold increase compared to the low-molar mass catalysts based on pyridine.",
