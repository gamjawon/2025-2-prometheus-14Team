CATALYSIS A: GENERAL ELSEVIER Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 217-227 Heteropolyacids supported on activated carbon as catalysts for the esterification of acrylic acid by butanol Pascale Dupont a, Jacques C. vrine a, Eric Paumard b, Gard Hecquet Fric Lefebvre 1,* a Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, CNRS, 2 avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex, France b CRDE Elf-Atochem, BP 1005, 57501 Saint-Avold, France `Elf, DRDI Atochem, 4 cours Michelet, 92091 Paris La Dense 10, Cedex 10, France Received 29 January 1995; revised 22 April 1995; accepted 22 April 1995 Abstract Heteropolyacids supported on activated carbon have been shown to be efficient solid catalysts for the esterification of acrylic acid by butanol in liquid phase. The reaction was carried out under batch and flow conditions and it was shown that such supported heteropolyacids display a better activity per proton than do conventional catalysts such as sulfuric acid or resins. It was also proved that under flow conditions deactivation of the catalyst was low (from 43 to 32% conversion) and was due to the dissolution of the supported heteropolyacid in the reaction medium (ca. 25% in the present case), after which a steady state stable catalyst was obtained, which makes such a system of prospective interest. In contrast, under batch conditions both polyanion dissolution and deposition of polymeric species resulted in deactivation of the catalyst (even in the presence of a polymerization inhibitor) which makes such a system not really reliable.

So, the challenge was to replace them by solid catalysts such as zeolites, alumina or resins, which are easier to separate from the products and less toxic. Heteropolyacids are known to be highly acidic compounds in solution [4], and so they have been used successfully in acid reactions such as esterification [5,6]. Unfortunately, as they are highly soluble in polar media, it is often difficult to separate them from the reaction products (the only method is distillation if one wishes to recycle them), which is problematic in industrial processes. So, a new family of catalysts has been developed by supporting heteropolyacids on various supports. It appears from literature data and from our own studies that the best support is activated carbon [7-9]. Moreover, we have shown recently [ 10] that acidic properties are retained in such catalysts. We report here the results on the esterification of acrylic acid by n-butanol catalyzed by supported heteropolyacids. The heteropolyacid chosen for these studies was H3PW120ao (denoted as HPW in the text), known to be the most acidic polyacid [ 4 ] and to display the Keggin structure. The studies were performed under both batch and flow conditions and the activity of the catalysts was compared to that of conventional resins. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterization of the catalysts H3PW,2040 - nH20 was supplied by Prolabo. Its purity was checked by 3'P NMR and it was used as received. Two activated carbons were used as supports: one of them (Darco from Aldrich) was a powder while the other (CECA SA 1763) was purchased as extrudates. The catalysts prepared with the Darco activated carbon were used for the batch experiments while those prepared with the CECA activated carbon were used for dynamic experiments in a flow system. As many other experiments were done with the Darco activated carbon [ 9 ] , it was characterized by several physical techniques. Its BET surface area (measured by nitrogen adsorption) was found to be S=1520 m2 g-'. Such a value is explained by the presence of a microporosity in the solid (pore volume 1.24 cm3 g-', mean pore radius < 2 nm). Electron microscopy showed that the solid is composed of uneven particles of 140 Am size. Programmed thermodesorption led to a major evolution of hydrogen (at T > 600) , water (two peaks at ca. 350 and 700 ) and carbon monoxide (one peak at ca. 700) . Only very small amounts of carbon dioxide were detected. The two resins used for the comparative testings were classical ion-exchange resins: VPOC-1052 (Bayer, capacity 1.8 eq dm--3) and Amberlyst 15 (Rohm and Hass, capacity 1.0 eq dm-3). P. Dupont et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 217-227 219 The HPW /carbon catalysts were prepared as described in ref. [ 7 ] by a typical ion-exchange method in 0.1 M HO aqueous solution. In order to have the highest polyanion loading, the solutions contained the same weight of activated carbon and H3PW12040 (preliminary studies showed that the highest polyanion loading was ca. 50 wt.-% or lower for all supports). The suspension was then filtered and the solid was washed with 0.1 M HCI solution and then dried overnight at 100. The polyanion loading of the samples was determined by various methods: 1. Determination of the amount of polyacid remaining in the exchange and washing solutions by mercury drop polarography. 2. Determination of the phosphorus content of the supported catalysts by recording 3' P MAS NMR spectra under quantitative conditions (recycle delay of at least 100 s). 3. Potentiometric titration by NaOH of the HPW/carbon in suspension in distilled water. The same results, within the experimental errors, were obtained with these three methods. 2.2. Batch experiments The reactions were carried out in a 1000 cm3 three neck flask equipped with a Vigreux column and a septum to enable sampling of the liquid phase. A distillation system was placed on the Vigreux column, allowing recovering of the water formed during the esterification reaction. As acrylic acid polymerizes easily, it was necessary to perform the reaction at low temperature (80) and to add a polymerization inhibitor (phenothiazine or p-methoxyphenol) to the reaction mixture. In addition, as the esterification reaction: RCOOH + R' OH -_ RCOOR' + H20 is an equilibrium, complete conversion can only be achieved by elimination of the water. This can be done by forming an azeotrope with an organic solvent such as toluene or butanol. After condensation, water separated from the organic phase which was then recycled. In order to maintain the temperature quite constant at 80 and to distil the water/organic solvent azeotrope, the system was connected to a vacuum line via a pressure regulation system. Typically, the pressure in the reactional system was maintained to ca. 2 - 104 Pa. Depending on the azeotrope used for removing the water, two slightly different experimental sets were used. (i) Butanol/water azeotrope: reaction temperature, 80; pressure: 2- 104 pa; butanol (BuOH) : 4.86 mol (360 g); acrylic acid (AA): 3.61 mol (260 g); BuOH / AA molar ratio: 1.35; polymerization inhibitor: phenothiazine (0.16 wt.-% of the total reagents corresponding to 0.38 wt.-% of the acrylic acid). (ii) Toluene/water azeotrope: reaction temperature: 80; pressure: 2.4 - 104 Pa; butanol (BuOH) : 3.61 mol (250 g); acrylic acid (AA): 4.86 mol (350 g); BuOH / 220 P. Dupont et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 217-227 AA molar ratio: 0.75; toluene: 1.09 mol (100 g); polymerization inhibitor: phen6thiazine (0.16 wt.-% of the total reagents corresponding to 0.28 wt.-% of the acrylic acid). In all cases, the kinetics of the reaction was followed by determination of the amount of evolved water with time and by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the solution. 2.3. Dynamic flow experiments The catalyst was placed in a column (1 meter long and 2.5 cm wide) kept at 80 by use of a thermostated bath. The reagents were introduced at the top of the column and the flow-rate was maintained constant by use of a small pump connected to a computer. Typical experimental conditions were as follows: Flow-rate: 100 g dm-3 h-'; temperature: 80; residence time: 107 min. The composition of the reaction mixture was: butanol (BuOH): 58 wt.-%; acrylic acid (AA): 41.9 wt.-%; BuOH/AA molar ratio: 1.34; polymerization inhibitor: p-methoxyphenol (0.1 wt.- The products were analyzed by GC [column 5% carbowax on chromosorb 101 (60-80 mesh), 1=1.50 m]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the catalysts The polyanion loading of the two samples was found to be 50 wt.-% for the catalyst prepared with the Aldrich activated carbon and 30 wt.-% for the sample prepared with the CECA carbon. In addition, 3'P MAS NMR spectroscopy showed that, in the two samples, the polyanion retained its integrity (presence of only one peak at -16 ppm shifted to -12 ppm on dehydrated samples). These results are quite in agreement with those of Kozhevnikov et al. [ 11 ] for highly loaded samples. Moreover, microcalorimetric experiments showed that supporting the heteropolyacid on activated carbon resulted in a constant number of acid sites per Keggin unit but also in a decrease of the acid strength (the mean heat of ammonia adsorption at 150 is 190 kJ mol-'for pure H3PW12040 and 150 kJ mol-'for HPW/carbon [ 10] ). A study as a function of the polyanion loading showed that increasing the polyanion loading increased the heat of ammonia absorption and increased also the activity per Keggin unit in the methanol to dimethyl ether dehydration reaction [ 8,9 ] . However, it was not possible to quantify the relative activities of the pure H3PW 12040 and the HPW /carbon catalysts as this reaction proceeds in the gas phase: in the case of the supported heteropolyacid all Keggin units are accessible to the reactants while in the case of the pure H3PW 12040 only an unknown part of them reacts readily (those contained in the pseudoliquid phase). The comparison P.

It was then observed [9] that the two HPW/carbon catalysts were three times less active, per Keggin unit, than the pure heteropolyacid, showing then that there is an important effect of the acid strength on the activity of the catalyst. 3.2. Reaction in batch conditions The activity and selectivity of H3PW1204o, HZS04 (the usually used industrial catalyst) and the HPW/carbon catalysts in the esterification of acrylic acid by butanol are given in Table 1. It can be seen that H3PW 04o is more active (reaction time decreased by a factor 2) and also more selective than HZS04 (in the two cases the predominant by-product is the butyl 3-butoxypropanoate, BuO-CHZ-CHZCOOBu, which corresponds to the addition of butanol onto the double bond of the acrylic ester). Fig. 1 gives the conversion as a function of time (determined as the evolved water) when the catalyst was the HPW/carbon catalyst and for the two cases (elimination of water by the butanol/water or toluene/water azeotrope). The two curves can be superposed, leading to the following remarks. (i) as the carbon just washed with 0.1 M MCI and dried overnight did not show any activity, it is reasonable to suppose that the catalytic activity was due to the HPW on the support; (ii) the choice of the azeotrope had no effect on the conversion; (iii) as the ratio AA/BuOH equalled 0.75 in the first case and 1.34=1/0.75 in the second one, the product nAA' n$upH (where nAA and nBupH are the number of 222 P.

Reaction B: toluene/water azeotrope. moles of acrylic acid and butanol in the flask) remained constant. We can assume that the kinetic law is of the form day,,/dt=k aAA aBH where ate,, aAA and asH are the activities (in the thermodynamic sense of the word) of water, acrylic acid and butanol, respectively. Such a kinetic law is generally admitted for esterification, while the terms corresponding to the reverse reaction are omitted in our case as water was removed by azeotropic distillation. The activities were assumed to be the same in the two cases (in the case of azeotropic distillation with toluene, one adds only 1.09 mol of toluene corresponding to ca. 13% of the total volume), since the number of moles of product (water) was observed to be the same. It may now be interesting to compare the activity of the HPW/carbon catalyst to those in homogeneous reactions with pure H3PWt2040 and H2S04. This is shown in Table 1. It is evident from these data that there is a great difference between the activities of the pure H3PWt2040 and the HPW/carbon catalyst. It was expected from the experiments with propanoic acid that the ratio of the activities for the esterification of acrylic acid should be 3, as mentioned above. The experimental results are in agreement with this assumption as a conversion of 98% was reached in 255 min with pure H3PWt2040 while 670 min were necessary to obtain a 95% conversion with the supported heteropolyacid (the same observations could also be made by comparing the TI/2 values in Table 1). Our results also show an interesting feature, namely that the selectivities for the pure and supported heteropolyacids were very good and even better than those obtained with sulfuric acid. Note also that the major secondary product was not the same in two cases: Bu0CHZ-CHZ-COOBu for pure H3PW1204p and Bu-O-Bu (di-n-butyl ether, formed by a classical dehydration reaction) for HPW/carbon, showing that there were probably some steric effects limiting the butyl 3-butoxypropanoate formation on the supported catalyst (an other explanation could be that this product was formed P. Dupont et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 217-227 223 Table 2 Loss of tungsten in the HPW/Carbon catalysts during the batch experiments Weight of Win the solution (g) Percent HPW in the catalyst Initial - 50.0 After the first reaction 1.43 48.4 After one recycling 0.33 48.0 at very high conversion when there were only alcohol and ester in the reaction medium). Another important parameter in these studies is the ease of recycling of the catalyst. For pure H3PW 12040 the only method is a distillation of the reaction mixture. The residue, which contained the heteropolyacid and some polymeric species was then reused without any purification. Under these conditions, only a very small loss of activity was observed [6]. For our supported heteropolyacids, the procedure was as follows: after reaction, the suspension containing the catalyst and the products was filtered. The solid was then washed with toluene and kept overnight in toluene. It was then reused immediately after separation from the toluene. The values of the activity and selectivity of the recycled catalysts are given in Table 1. It is evident from these data that there was a significant decrease of the activity when the catalyst recycled (13% after 670 min when the azeotropic solvent was butanol and 20% when it was toluene). A possible explanation could be that there was a loss of polyacid on the support, by dissolution in the reaction mixture as has been shown previously [ 12] . So, we determined the quantity of polyacid in the solutions, after filtration, by tungsten plasma emission spectroscopy. This was done for the solutions without toluene (butanol/water azeotrope). The results are given in Table 2. The loss of polyacid in the solution was not negligible and it decreased with the number of recyclings, in agreement with findings in ref. [12]. In the recycle experiment, we calculated that the HPW loading on the catalyst was, at the end of the reaction, 48 wt.-%. By itself, such a difference (between 50 and 48 wt.-% loading) cannot explain the size of the activity decrease. A reasonable explanation might be that this decrease was also due to a polymerization of acrylic acid on the support, blocking then some acidic sites. It should then be logical to have the same activity loss when the reaction was carried out in the presence of toluene. However, the decrease was more important but it should be noticed that the amount of polymerization inhibitor (in relation to the acrylic acid and not to the total amount of reactants) was not the same in the two experiments: it is about twice when there was no toluene in the reaction medium, and so there was probably a more important polymerization of acrylic acid on the catalyst (blocking some acid sites) in this latter case. Another explanation, which could also have the above one as a consequence, could be that phenothiazine (which is a weak base present as 0.45 mol per polyanion 224 P. Dupont et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 217-227 46 44 c. 42 o Q 40 o ~- 38 C 36 O = 34 V 32 30 1 28 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160180 Time (h) Fig. 2.

This will have two consequences: (i) decrease of the number of acidic sites during the recycling and (ii) as the inhibitor concentration decreased, polymerization of acrylic acid could occur. However, this cannot explain the difference between the experiments in butanol and toluene. 3.3. Reaction in a dynamic flow reactor For these experiments we used a catalyst purchased as extrudates in order to avoid diffusion phenomena through the solid. The catalyst volume was 200 cm3, corresponding to 0.03 mol of protons (0.01 mol of polyacid). As water was not eliminated during these experiments, the higher conversion which could be reached corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium (ca. 75% conversion, the value of the equilibrium constant being 4) . Fig. 2 shows the variations of the conversion with time on stream. The selectivity remained constant over the whole experiment and was equal to 98% (the sideproduct was di-n-butyl ether).

Ratio of the conversion of acrylic acid to the actual quantity of tungsten on the HPW /CECA carbon catalyst as a function of time. decreased rapidly but a limiting value corresponding to ca. 32% conversion was reached after 200 h. In order to determine if the deactivation process was due to a loss of polyanion on the catalyst, as described above in the case of batch experiments, or to a decrease in the number of active sites by polymeric species formed in the reaction, the quantity of tungsten in the reaction products was determined by plasma emission spectroscopy. Its variation with time is given in Fig. 3. It is seen that an important loss of tungsten occurred in the first stages of the reaction, and then the amount decreased continuously with time until after 200 h it could be considered negligible. The amount of tungsten lost corresponded to ca. 25% of the initial loading. Such a curve must be compared to that in Fig. 2. It is then interesting to calculate the ratio of the conversion of acrylic acid to the quantity of tungsten which was effectively present in the catalyst. This shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that this ratio is constant. One can thus reasonably conclude that the deactivation process was only due to the loss of tungsten, without polymerization of acrylic acid, in contrast to what was observed in the batch experiments ( vide supra). 3.4. Comparison with acidic resins Acidic resins are known to be very efficient catalysts for esterification reactions and even some of them are used industrially. In order to compare their catalytic properties to those of H3PW 12040 we studied two of them ( VPOC-1052 and Amberlyst 15) in the dynamic system under the same conditions as the HPW/carbon catalyst. However, as their volume, for the same quantity of protons, is smaller than that of the supported heteropolyacid, it was necessary to mix them with small glass balls in order to have the same residence time of the reactants. Fig. 5 shows the variations of the conversion of acrylic acid with time for the three catalysts. It is evident from these data that HPW /carbon was the most efficient catalyst, probing that it could be a good substitute to the resins.

Heteropolyacids supported on activated carbon have been shown to be efficient solid catalysts for the esterification of acrylic acid by butanol in liquid phase. The reaction was carried out under batch and flow conditions and it was shown that such supported heteropolyacids display a better activity per proton than do conventional catalysts such as sulfuric acid or resins. It was also proved that under flow conditions deactivation of the catalyst was low (from 43 to 32% conversion) and was due to the dissolution of the supported heteropolyacid in the reaction medium (ca. 25% in the present case), after which a steady state stable catalyst was obtained, which makes such a system of prospective interest. In contrast, under batch conditions both polyanion dissolution and deposition of polymeric species resulted in deactivation of the catalyst (even in the presence of a polymerization inhibitor) which makes such a system not really reliable.
