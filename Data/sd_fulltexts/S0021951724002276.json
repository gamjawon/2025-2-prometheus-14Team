Printed by Henry Ling Ltd., Dorchester, United Kingdom âˆž The paper used in this publication meets the requirements of ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992 (Permanence of Paper) Peer Review Policy on Journal of Catalysis The practice of peer review is meant to ensure that good science is published. It is an objective process at the heart of scholarly publishing and is conducted with rigor by all reputable scientific journals. Our referees therefore play an essential role in maintaining the high standards of Journal of Catalysis and all manuscripts are peer-reviewed using the procedure outlined below. Initial manuscript evaluation The Editor first evaluates all manuscripts. It is rare, but possible, for an exceptional manuscript to be accepted at this stage. Those rejected at this stage lack novelty, con- tainserious scientific flaws or unacceptable English usage and grammar, or address topics outside the aims and scope of the journal. Those that meet minimum criteria for clarity, novelty, and rigor are passed on to at least two experts for their review. Type of Peer Review This journal employs single-blind review, in which the referee remains unknown to the authors throughout the process. Referee Selection Process Referees are chosen based on their proven expertise in the subject of the manuscript from an extensive database that is continuously updated. We welcome suggestions for referees from the author, but these recommendations are used at the discretion of the Editor, as are requests for exclusion of specific reviewers based on supported claims of conflicts of interest. Referee reports Referees are asked to evaluate the manuscript on the basis of: â€“ novelty, creativity, originality and relevance â€“ sound and clearly described methods â€“ strict adherence to ethical guidelines â€“ clear evidence for conclusions â€“ accurate citation of all relevant previous work Referees are not asked or expected to correct or edit manuscripts for language. How long does the review process take? Manuscripts are typically reviewed within two months of submission. Contradic- tory reviews and recommendations or delayed reviewer responses may require the Editor to seek additional assessments from other reviewers, which may be asked to adjudicate and give an access to the contradictory or non-rigorous reviews. Final report The final decision to accept, modify, or reject the manuscript is sent to the author together with any specific comments provided by referees. Editorâ€™s Decision is final The referees act as expert advisors to the Editor, who has the sole responsibility to make the final decision to accept or reject the article.
