In this work, we prepare a series of NiCu alloy film catalysts with different contents by magnetron sputtering to investigate the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. The results show that alloying of Ni and Cu can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of benzaldehyde hydrogenation. With the increase of Ni content, the conversion rate of benzaldehyde increases two to three orders of magnitude, and the Faradaic efficiency of the Ni-rich catalysts is higher than that of the Cu-rich catalysts. In addition, the alloy composition affects the relative coverages of H and benzaldehyde, leading to different reaction orders in benzaldehyde. The boosted electrocatalytic activity with the increase of Ni content is in accordance with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that increasing Ni content can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the alloy catalysts. Graphical Abstract Alloying Ni with Cu changes the binding energy of benzaldehyde by redistribution of electrons, and therefore, increases the reaction rate and Faradaic frequency of benzaldehyde hydrogenation. Keywords Benzaldehyde hydrogenation Electrocatalysis NiCu alloy Magnetron sputtering Alloying effect 1 Introduction With the development of industry, the contradiction between the growth of global energy demand and issues is becoming increasingly severe [1,2]. Biomass, as an easily accessible renewable resource, has attracted much attention for the production of high value-added chemicals and energy carriers [3]. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) is considered as a sustainable alternative to conventional hydrogenation, using the renewable electricity instead of external hydrogen to reduce the unsaturated and unstable compounds in the biomass-derived oils under the mild reaction conditions [4,5]. Carbonyl compounds, such as furfural and benzaldehyde, can be easily reduced by external potential driving [5,6]. Benzaldehyde, composed of both aromatic ring and carbonyl group, is usually used as a model molecule for hydrogenation of biomass-derived aldehydes [7]. Precious metals (such as Pt, Pd) are highly active catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, but their limited abundance and high cost limit their wide applications [8,9]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost, non-precious metal catalysts with the same catalytic activity as precious metals as substitutes for the ECH of biomass-derived organic molecules [5,10]. Nickel-based catalysts, with lower cost and higher availability, show high activity in the hydrogenation of biomass platform molecules [11,12], while show the disadvantages of low stability and high overpotential [13]. The bimetallic catalysts, prepared by adding another metal to the catalyst, can improve the reaction rate, product selectivity, stability, and adjust the shape and structure by regulating the catalyst composition [8,11,12]. It has been reported that Cu can improve the stability of Ni in the hydrogenation process and increase the activity of catalysts [9,13,14]. This has been ascribed to the structural and electronic effects between Ni and Cu elements, leading to a better catalytic activity than either of the metals [3,15]. Magnetron sputtering is a physical vapor deposition process to synthesize thin films by depositing various metals and compounds on the substrates [16]. This technology is easy-control and low-cost, and the sputtered film has high purity, uniform composition and good adhesion, therefore, it has been widely used in industrial applications [16,17]. The desired metal composition and metal loading of the sample can be easily controlled by changing the power and time of sputtering. In general, the substrate for sputtering is arbitrary, which can be glass, silicon wafer and tool steel, etc [18]. Carbon fiber paper (CFP) was chosen as the substrate in this work because its surface inertness avoids other side reactions [19]. In this study, we report an investigation on the synergistic effect of Ni and Cu on the catalytic activity in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. A series of NiCu film catalysts with different atomic fractions were prepared by magnetron sputtering, and pure Ni and Cu catalysts were also prepared as control groups. The conversion rates of benzaldehyde hydrogenation and the corresponding Faradaic efficiency (FE) were measured on the catalysts. The NiCu alloy catalysts demonstrate a significantly higher catalytic performances than either pure Ni or Cu catalyst, indicating that the alloying of Ni and Cu can effectively improve the catalytic activities. It demonstrates a volcanic relationship between the composition and activity of the NiCu catalyst, and the formation rate of benzyl alcohol and FE achieve the highest point on Ni90Cu10, indicating an optimal binding energy of benzaldehyde on Ni90Cu10. The boosted catalytic activity in benzaldehyde hydrogenation with the increase of Ni content was in accordance with the electrochemical impedance spectra. This finding will be helpful for further development of alloy catalysts in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and catalysts Benzaldehyde, sodium acetate, acetic acid, ethyl acetate and cyclohexanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Toray carbon fiber paper was purchased from Fuel Cell Store. Nafion 117 membrane was purchased from 3 A Chem. The sputtering target materials Ni and Cu (99.99 wt%) were purchased from Beijing Dream Material Technology Co., Ltd. The Milli-Q water purification system was used to prepare double deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm from purification of deionized water. 2.2 Synthesis of Ni, Cu and NiCu film catalysts CFP was sonicated in ethanol for 5 minutes and then dried in air at 60 °C overnight. A magnetron sputtering equipment (SKY Technology Development Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China) was used for direct co-deposition of Ni and Cu on the CFP. The normal inclination between target and substrate was 20° and the working distance for sputtering was 6 cm. The entire sputtering process was operated at room temperature and at 1 Pa Ar with a flow rate of 30 cm3 min1. Under the same conditions, pure Ni and pure Cu film catalysts with single component were sputtered using the corresponding targets. Except for synthesizing Ni98Cu2 film catalyst, where the Cu target was powered on by radio-frequency (RF), the direct current (DC) was used in all the other cases. The sputtering time and working power of the Ni and Cu targets corresponding to the synthesis of each catalyst are shown in Table S1, to maintain the surface metal loading at ∼0.3 mg cm−2. 2.3 Catalyst characterizations The phase composition of the film catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, XD-3 diffractometer from Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd., China). The microstructures of the samples were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS SIGMA300). The element distributions and chemical compositions were characterized by the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscope attached to SEM. The chemical valence states of the elements were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI) at room temperature with an Al Kα X-ray source. C 1 s with a binding energy of 284.8 eV was used for calibrating all XPS spectra. 2.4 Electrocatalytic measurements The electrocatalytic reactions were carried out using a CHI 760E potentiostat in a two-compartment batch electrolysis cell, which was separated by a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane, as described in Ref [20]. H2O2 solution (3 vol%) and sulfuric acid (2 M) were used to pretreat the proton exchange membrane before reaction. 60 mL of 1 M acetic acid buffer (pH 5) was added to both the cathode and anode chambers. The working electrode was located in the cathode chamber, consisting of a film catalyst with an area of 1 cm−2 connected to a graphite clamp. Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) electrode with double junction protection was used as the reference electrode, which was also placed in the cathode chamber. Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and placed in the anode chamber. The entire reaction process was carried out at room temperature and ambient pressure with a stirring speed of 500 rpm. The catalytic rates at different rotation speeds in Fig. S1 indicated that the mass transfer limitation was eliminated above 500 rpm. The following equation was used to convert the potentials reported in this work to reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE): ERHE= E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.2046 + 0.059 × pH. Using the iR compensation function with a compensation level of 85% on the potentiometer to correct E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) [21,22]. The contribution of the remaining 15% to the electric potential was calculated to be less than 10 mV. A constant current of −40 mA was used to reduce the catalyst for 10 minutes before the ECH reaction. Then, 120 µL of benzaldehyde was added in the cathode chamber, to obtain a benzaldehyde concentration of 20 mmol L−1 in the system. The electrocatalytic hydrogenation process was carried out at a constant electric potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE for 40 minutes. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed before and after benzaldehyde addition at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. In addition, experiments were conducted at different electric potentials and reactant concentrations. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out by a Zahner Zennium potentiostat at open circuit voltage and the charged state. The frequency range was set from 100 mHz to 10 kHz with an excitation voltage of 5 mV. 2.5 Product analysis During the experiment, 0.5 mL of solution was sampled from the cathode chamber at regular intervals. The solution was extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate and then mixed thoroughly to separate the aqueous and organic phases and analyze the content of products and remaining reactants. Gas chromatography equipped with a wax capillary column (30 m x 250 μm) and a flame ionization detector was used for the quantitative analysis of the separated organic phases, and cyclohexanol was used as the internal standard. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations As illustrated in Fig. S2, magnetron sputtering technology was used to synthesize the pure Ni, pure Cu and NiCu alloy films. The NiCu alloy films with various Ni and Cu contents were obtained by co-sputtering Cu and Ni on the CFP, while the pure Ni and pure Cu films were prepared by the same method. The Ni and Cu contents of the alloy films were varied by the regulation of the sputtering power and determined through the EDX analysis, which are presented in Fig. S3. As shown in Fig. 1, the phase compositions of the pure Ni, pure Cu, and NiCu alloy films with different atomic fractions were characterized by XRD. The characteristic peaks at 18.0°, 26.4°, and 54.5° correspond to the substrate CFP [23]. Peaks of the pure Ni film at 44.3°, 51.7° and 76.1° correspond to the Ni phase (PDF # 70–1849), and peaks of the pure Cu film at 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° correspond to the Cu phase (PDF # 70–3038). The XRD peaks of the alloy catalysts are significantly shifted and are all located between those of the Cu phase and the Ni phase, indicating the formation of NiCu alloy [9]. In addition, the diffraction peak of the alloy films shifts towards lower 2θ angles in comparison with Ni, indicating that alloying Cu leads to lattice expansion. The surface morphologies and structures of the samples were characterized using SEM. Fig. 2a-c shows the surface morphologies of Ni, Cu and Ni57Cu43 film catalysts at lower magnification, and the surface of the carbon paper substrate is sputtered uniformly. At a higher magnification, obvious grain characteristics can be observed in the Ni57Cu43 film, especially in the grooves among the fibers of CFP (Fig. 2d-f). Similar scenarios appear in the other Ni, Cu and NiCu films (Fig. S4), indicating that the element content negligibly affects the morphology and structure of the NiCu alloy films. Additionally, EDX mapping (Fig. 2g-i) shows that the Ni and Cu elements of Ni57Cu43 are evenly distributed in the entire field of view, indicating that both Ni and Cu are well coated on the fiber surface of CFP, and the other NiCu film catalysts show the similar results (Fig. S3). The elemental composition and valence states of the NiCu alloy film catalysts, Ni17Cu83, Ni57Cu43 and Ni90Cu10, were analyzed using XPS technology. As shown in Fig. 3, two major peaks of Ni are Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, which are located at ∼ 855.9 and 874.2 eV respectively, with the corresponding satellite peaks located at ∼ 861.2 and 879.5 eV. These peaks are attributed to the oxidation state of Ni, and their large area may be due to the spontaneous surface oxidation of the catalyst in air before testing. The peak at about 853.5 eV is attributed to the metallic Ni on the catalyst surface[24]. The Cu characteristic peaks of the Ni-Cu catalysts are shown in Fig. 3b. An apparent peak at 932.6 eV is attributed to the metallic Cu[25], and the two peaks at around 934.6 and 952.3 eV are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. With the increase of Cu content, the peak shifts towards a higher binding energy. The peak of metallic Cu shifts from 934.2 eV (Ni90Cu10) to 935.1 eV (Ni17Cu83), and the peak of Cu 2p3/2 moves from 952.2 eV to 952.4 eV, which are evidence indicating the interaction between Ni and Cu elements[26]. Due to the lower work function of Cu (4.65 eV) than Ni (5.15 eV)[27], the binding energy transfer in the energy spectrum is attributed to partial electron transfer from Cu to Ni. The electronic interactions between Ni and Cu lead to an uneven distribution of electrons, which could change the adsorption energy of benzaldehyde and the related intermediates on the catalyst surface[28]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performances of the catalysts in benzaldehyde hydrogenation Fig. 4 shows the LSV curves of pure Ni, pure Cu and NiCu film catalysts in 1 M acetate buffer with and without 20 mmol L−1 benzaldehyde. Only hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs in the reaction system in the absence of benzaldehyde. Compared to pure Ni or Cu film catalysts, the NiCu alloy catalysts show a much higher activity of HER (the dashed lines in Fig. 4). The HER current increased significantly as the Ni content in the alloy catalyst increased, from −4.27 mA cm−2 for Ni17Cu83 to −11.43 mA cm−2 for Ni98Cu2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE. Adsorption of organic compounds such as benzaldehyde on metal surfaces has been reported to inhibit electron transfer to H+, thereby inhibiting HER and reducing the current density [29]. Apparently, HER is suppressed over Cu-rich alloy catalysts, confirmed by the lower current densities with benzaldehyde. However, for Ni-rich alloy catalysts, the current densities are enhanced after the addition of benzaldehyde, which indicates the ECH process enables faster charge transfer [28]. The current densities of the NiCu alloy catalysts are significantly higher than that of either Ni or Cu catalyst after adding benzaldehyde, indicating that the synergistic effect of Ni and Cu can promote the electrocatalytic performances of the alloy catalysts. In addition, the current densities of the Ni-rich catalysts are higher than those of the Cu-rich catalysts, indicating that the Ni-rich catalysts possess faster kinetics of ECH process. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were performed over different catalysts in the absence of benzaldehyde as shown in Fig. S5. The CVs were measured at different scanning rates (Fig. S6) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalysts were calculated accordingly based on the current density at 0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. S7). The Cdl of film catalysts ranges from 23.2 mF cm−2 (Ni98Cu2, Ni44Cu56) to 31.4 mF cm−2 (Ni), showing a small difference. This indicates the activity difference mainly results from the intrinsic activity of the catalysts rather than the electrochemical active surface area (the number of active sites). The ECH of benzaldehyde was carried out in acetate buffer (pH 5) over film catalysts to convert the reactive carbonyl group to hydroxyl group [28]. The product analysis based on the gas chromatography showed that no other products other than benzyl alcohol were generated [30,31].The formation rates of benzyl alcohol and the corresponding FE in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde catalyzed by pure Ni, pure Cu, and NiCu alloys in a 1 M acetic acid buffer solution at −0.3 V vs. RHE are shown in Fig. 5a. The bar chart shows the formation rates of benzyl alcohol, which were determined by the increased benzyl alcohol concentration with time in the system. The dot plot displays the corresponding FE, which are defined by the ratio of the charges consumed in benzaldehyde hydrogenation to the total charges of the reaction process. The FE and rate mentioned in the text were calculated below 20 min to ensure that they were within the kinetic region (conversion below 10%). The associated electrochemical properties as a function of time were shown in Figs. S8–11. As shown in Fig. 5a, the formation rates of benzyl alcohol significantly increase on the NiCu catalysts compared to pure Ni or pure Cu film catalysts, indicating that the alloying of Ni and Cu can significantly promote the catalytic activity. It shows that both the reaction rates and FE increase with the increasing Ni content for the NiCu alloy catalysts, and the rate increases from 0.06 mmol cm−2 h−1 for Ni17Cu83 to 0.20 mmol cm−2 h−1 for Ni90Cu10, much higher than that of Ni (0.0003 mmol cm−2 h−1) and Cu (0.002 mmol cm−2 h−1) under the same reaction conditions. In addition, the Ni-rich catalysts show a higher FE than that of the Cu-rich catalysts, with the FE increasing from 15% for Ni17Cu83 to 76% for Ni90Cu10, which is in accordance with the LSV study that the Ni-rich catalysts possess faster kinetics of ECH process. It is worth noting that when the Ni content reaches a relative high value (98 at%), the catalyst activity slightly decreases, though still higher than that of other catalysts with a lower Ni content (≤82 at%). Previous studies suggested that there is a volcanic relationship between the binding strength of the reactant on the metal and the reaction rate. This can be explained by the Sabatier principle, the weak binding may limit the contact between the substrate and the catalyst, while excessive binding energy may make it difficult for the substrate to be activated[32,33]. Notably, Ni and Cu are located on the different sides of the volcanic peak[33], therefore, NiCu alloys possess relatively optimal binding energy in comparison, which is in accordance with the volcanic relationship between the composition of the NiCu catalyst and the activity. In the above experiments, the reaction rates and FE are consistent in reflecting the relationship between the catalyst composition and the catalytic activity. The current density difference between the LSVs with and without the benzaldehyde addition can be used to predict the ECH performances. As shown in Fig. 5b, a positive correlation presents between the reaction activity and the current density difference with a coefficient of 0.7. The current density of the Ni90Cu10 film catalyst increases by the most after the addition of benzaldehyde, which indicates more electron transfer during the catalytic process and leads to the highest activity. Based on the above experimental results, the Ni90Cu10 catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performances for benzaldehyde hydrogenation among the explored catalysts, so it was selected for further investigation. As shown in Fig. 5c, the hydrogenation rate increases at a more negative applied potential, while FE decreases, showing a linear relationship [30]. As a matter of fact, both ECH and HER increase with the potential decreasing (more negative potential). However, absorbed benzaldehyde competes with adsorbed H for the same active site, therefore, the H coverage increases at a cost of benzaldehyde coverage decreasing. As the potential decreases, H occupies more active sites, and HER boosts more significantly than ECH, resulting in a decrease in FE, which accords well with the changes in the order of benzaldehyde hydrogenation from near zero to positive [34]. The reactant concentration effect was also studied on the Ni90Cu10 film catalyst as shown in Fig. 5d. Within the concentration range from 5 to 30 mmol L−1 benzaldehyde, the FE of the conversion from benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol monotonically increases with the increase of reactant concentration, due to the scenario that benzaldehyde occupies more active sites at a higher benzaldehyde concentration and inhibits HER [34]. However, when benzaldehyde concentration increases from 20 to 30 mmol L−1, the rate levels off, indicating the coverage of benzaldehyde arrives at a high value and changes negligibly with the bulk concentration. To figure out how the alloy component affects the reaction kinetics, the experiments at multiple potentials and reactant concentrations were also explored on a Cu-rich catalyst, Ni44Cu56. In Fig. 5e, the ECH rates of benzaldehyde increase with the potential decreasing over Ni44Cu56, which is the same as that of Ni90Cu10 due to the larger driving force. However, in contrast to Ni90Cu10, the FE of Ni44Cu56 shows the same increase trend as that of ECH rate, indicating the coverage of benzaldehyde gradually exceeds that of H on the electrode surface with the decreasing potential. An assumption is that the electric potential modifies the electronic property of the catalyst, which changes the adsorption energy of benzaldehyde and the related intermediates on the catalyst surface, which varies with the alloy composition. In addition, both the hydrogenation rate and FE decrease with the increasing reactant concentration on Ni44Cu56, showing a negative reaction order in benzaldehyde in Fig. 5f. This indicates benzaldehyde saturates the catalyst surface at a much lower concentration over Ni44Cu56 than on Ni90Cu10. The decreasing FE is probably due to the accumulation of reactant blocking the mass transfer of hydronium ions and hindering H adsorption [35]. The different reaction orders in benzaldehyde and the potential effect over the different catalysts indicate that alloying can change the binding energy of benzaldehyde by the redistribution of electrons of the catalyst, therefore, affect the coverages of benzaldehyde and H. EIS was used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the film catalysts. The Nyquist diagram consists of a small arc in the high-frequency region attributed to the electrode structure, and an anomalous line in the low-frequency range attributed to charge transfer resistance ( Fig. 6) [36,37]. The slope of the diagrams increases with the increase of Cu content both in presence and absence of reactants, indicating a higher charge transfer resistance [38]. In addition, EIS measurements of the NiCu catalysts under different electric potentials were also performed (Fig. S12). As the electric potential becomes more negative, the arc radius of the Nyquist diagram decreases, which is due to the acceleration of electron transport process and the corresponding impedance decreasing. The original EIS data were fitted by an equivalent circuit (Fig. S13). In this circuit, Rs, shown to be about 3–5 Ω, represents the solution resistance (Fig. 6). The high-frequency component uses Rc and Qc, which represent the resistance and capacitance of the coating, respectively. The low-frequency component uses Rct and Qdl, which represent the charge transfer resistance and the capacitance, respectively. The constant phase angle element Q was used instead of pure capacitor C in this circuit, due to the possible dispersion effect between the metal/coating system [39,40]. As shown in Table S2 and Table S3, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) increases with the decrease of Ni content both with and without benzaldehyde, which is in accordance with the results in Fig. 6. 4 Conclusions The NiCu alloy film catalysts significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance of benzaldehyde hydrogenation compared with the Ni or Cu catalyst. Due to the regulated binding energy of benzaldehyde on the NiCu alloy catalysts, there is a volcanic relationship between the increase of the electrocatalytic performances and the Ni content of the alloy catalysts. With the optimized atomic ratio of Ni and Cu, the reaction rate of Ni90Cu10 reaches 0.20 mmol cm−2 h−1 at −0.3 V vs. RHE, two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of Ni (0.0003 mmol cm−2 h−1) and Cu (0.002 mmol cm−2 h−1) under the same reaction conditions. Meanwhile, the FE increases from 15% for Ni17Cu83 to 76% for Ni90Cu10, which is in accordance with the LSV study that the Ni-rich catalysts possess faster kinetics of ECH process, and the EIS reveals that increasing Ni content can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the alloy catalysts. The different reaction orders in benzaldehyde and the potential effect over the different catalysts indicate that alloying can change the binding energy of benzaldehyde. This work demonstrates that alloying of Ni and Cu improves the electrocatalytic behaviors in benzaldehyde hydrogenation, and clarifies the effect of the contents of Ni and Cu in bimetallic alloys on the catalytic activity. The results of this work provide guidance for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes by rational design of alloy catalysts.

        "dc:description": "In this work, we prepare a series of NiCu alloy film catalysts with different contents by magnetron sputtering to investigate the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu in electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. The results show that alloying of Ni and Cu can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of benzaldehyde hydrogenation. With the increase of Ni content, the conversion rate of benzaldehyde increases two to three orders of magnitude, and the Faradaic efficiency of the Ni-rich catalysts is higher than that of the Cu-rich catalysts. In addition, the alloy composition affects the relative coverages of H and benzaldehyde, leading to different reaction orders in benzaldehyde. The boosted electrocatalytic activity with the increase of Ni content is in accordance with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that increasing Ni content can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the alloy catalysts.",
