BOSTELAAR and WOLFGANG M. H. SACHTLER* Gorlaeus Laboratoria, State University of Leiden, P. 0. Box 9500, 2300 RA Leiden (The Netherlands) (Received January 5, 1984; accepted March 26, 1984) Summary The asymmetric hydrogenation of a prochiral keto compound has been studied using silica-supported nickel catalysts which were 'modified' with (2?,E)-tartaric acid. The enantiomeric excess is found to increase with the severity of the catalyst reduction. For catalyst modification in aqueous solu- tion an alkali hydroxide is conventionally used to adjust the pH, but this alkali is not a necessary ingredient of the product-determining surface complex, as follows from a significant enantioselectivity found upon modi- fying in a methanolic solution in the absence of alkali. Halides such as NaBr, when dissolved in the liquid reaction mixture, are reversibly adsorbed on the tartrate-modified nickel surface and alter the enantioselectivity significantly. The results disprove a model which attributed the increase in enantiomeric excess to preferential and irreversible blocking of non-selective sites by the halide. They suggest, rather, that adsorbed ions affect the stereochemistry of the asymmetric surface complex. Introduction The hydrogenation of prochiral keto compounds: 0 H II catalyst I Ri-C-Ra + H; ^ Ri-C'\"-R2 OH is known to produce the two enantiomers of the hydroxy compounds in un- equal quantities, provided the heterogeneous catalyst has been 'modified' by *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Chemistry Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60201, U.S.A. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 378 exposing it to a solution of an optically active amino or hydroxy acid [1]. The selectivity of the reaction, known as the enantiomeric excess, is defined by e.e.= ([R] - [S])/([R] + [S]) X 100%, where [R] and [S] stand for the concentration of the respective enantiomer of the product. In particular, high values of e.e. have been reported by various groups for the hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate (MAA) over (R,R )-tartaric acid-modified nickel catalysts [2]. There is ample evidence suggesting that the modification process is essen- tially a corrosive chemisorption resulting in the formation of a tartrate com- plex adhering to the catalyst surface [3]. Indeed, it was found [3] that modifying Ni/SiO; catalysts with sodium nickel tartrate (NaNiTA) complexes results in an enantioselectivity of the same sign and similar magnitude as modification with a tartaric acid solution partly neutralized with NaOH. The conditions under which modification is carried out are of importance for the magnitude of the e.e. measured, but the relationship between the parameters catalyst preparation [4]; pretreatment [5]; modification [6]; washing; hydrogenation conditions [7]; promoters [8]; conversion [9], etc. and the selectivity are complex and little understood. The objective of the present work, described in this and the following paper [10], is to investigate the effects of these parameters on activity and enantioselectivity for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of MAA. We, therefore, have systematically varied relevant parameters, keeping others constant. In the present paper attention has been focussed on the solvent during modifi- cation and on the washing conditions, as this should be relevant to the question whether alkali ions are (1) necessary and/or (2) beneficial for high selectivity of the modified catalysts. The effect of washing should also be relevant in view of recent findings that co-modifiers such as alkali halides, which can be added during the modification, have a beneficial effect on the selectivity [11]. In the following paper [10], we will describe an extended study of the role of different alkali halides. Where these salts are added to the (liquid) hydrogenation mixture we shall call them 'promoters' to distin- guish them from additives to the modification solution, which are called 'co- modifers'. Experimental Catalyst preparation Ni/Si02 catalysts (5, 10 and 12 wt.%) were prepared by impregnation of the support (SiO; pellets, 2.5 mm in diameter, with wide pores of 40 - 80 nm and a surface area of 40 m2 g~1, kindly provided by Koninklijke/Shell Laboratorium, Amsterdam) with an aqueous solution of Ni(N03)2(H20)e (Baker, p.a.). After decantation, the catalysts were dried for 16 h at 105 C. For each experiment (three different hydrogenations) a portion of 3 g of a catalyst was reduced in a hydrogen flow of 150 - 200 ml min~1 at 400 C for 16 h, unless otherwise stated. 379 Catalyst modification The modification of the freshly reduced catalysts was performed in four different ways: (1) 'HzTA/HzO': The catalyst was modified in 100 ml of a 2 wt.% solution of (.R,.R)-tartaric acid (Aldrich, Gold Label) in demineralized water, brought to pH 5.0 with NaOH (Merck, p.a.), at 100 C for 2 h, under air; (2) 'H^TA/MeOH': Modification of the catalyst was carried out in 100 ml of a 2 wt.% solution of (R,R )-tartaric acid (Aldrich, Gold Label) in methanol (Merck, p.a.) at 66 C for 2 h, under air; (3) 'NiS04/H2TA/MeOH': Prior to modification as in (2), the catalyst was pretreated with 50 ml of a 2 wt.% aqueous solution of ?804 (Merck, p.a.) at 20 or 100 C. This 'soaking' was followed by decantation and, if desired, by washing with methanol [5]; (4) 'NiTA^O': A 0.04 M Ni aqueous solution of NiTA was prepared by the addition of NaOH to an aqueous solution of ?(N03)2, centrifugation of the colloid precipitate, decantation and washing with demineralized water (4 X ), addition of water and (R,R )-tartaric acid, and adjustment of this solution to pH 7.0 with NaOH. 100 ml of this solution was used for modifying the catalyst during 2 h, under air, at either 20 or 100 C. After modification, the catalysts were washed. Unless otherwise stated, washing with 100 ml demineralized water was followed by washing (3 X) with 50 ml methanol for 10 min. The catalysts which had been modified in methanolic solutions were only washed (3 X) with 50 ml MeOH. The procedure of adding alkali halides, e.g. LiBr (Merck, p.a.), NaBr (Baker, p.a.), RbBr (Fluka, purum) and Nal (Baker, p.a.) to the catalysts was also varied: (1) co-modification: the alkali halide was added to the modification solution [11]; (2) re-modification: the modified and washed catalysts were treated with 50 ml of a 22 mmol 1~1 methanolic solution of the alkali halide at 66 C for 1 to 3 h, under air, followed by washing three times with 25 ml MeOH; (3) promotion: the alkali halide was added to the hydrogenation solution. Hydrogenation The liquid-phase hydrogenations were carried out in atmospheric batch reactors, as depicted in Fig. 1. After washing the catalyst, portions of about 0.7 g of the (methanol-wet) catalyst were quickly transferred to three reac- tion vessels, each containing a mixture of 10 ml 50/50 (v/v) methyl aceto- acetate (Fluka, p.a.) with methanol (Merck, p.a.). The systems were flushed three times with nitrogen and three times with hydrogen before the hydro- genations were started. Hydrogenations were carried out at 50 C for 20 h. Thereafter, the catalysts were separated from the reaction mixture by centri- fugation, and methanol was removed by distillation under reduced pressure. 380 Pig. 1.

Product analysis The compositions of the purified MAA/methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB) mixtures were determined by GLC (Packard Becker 427) with a 3 m column of 10% Carbowax 20M TPA on Chromosorb WAW. The optical rota- tions (OD ) of these samples were measured with a Bendix NPL 143D polari- meterin a 0.20 dm cell. Correcting for the density of (.R)-MHB (1.05 g cm\"3), the enantiomeric excess e.e. (optical yield) of (JZ)-MHB was calculated from an and the concentration CMHB (vol.%) according to the equation [11]: e.e. = Results The effects of the reduction procedure and of the catalyst loading on the e.e. of 'H^TA/HzO' modified catalysts are summarized in Table 1.

If any dependence on Ni load exists in the range 5-12 wt.%, it is overshadowed by the effects of the reduction procedure. In Table 2 the results of prewetting the catalysts and of the modification solvent are compiled. The prewetting has been recommended in order to facilitate transport during modification by avoiding gas plugs in pore holes [5b]. Prewetting was achieved by evacua- tion followed by condensation of methanol vapour onto the freshly reduced catalysts. In agreement with earlier results, this effect is found to be bene- ficial but small for liquid-phase hydrogenations [5b]. Modifications in aqueous solutions gave significantly higher e.e. values than those in methanolic solutions. However, the e.e. is not zero for modifications in methanolic solu- tions. We conclude from this that alkali ions, though beneficial [6], are not indispensable for enantioselectivity of the tartrate-modified nickel catalyst. The effect of washing the catalyst with methanol after the modification procedure is shown in Table 3. It appears that thorough methanol washing enhances the selectivity. This is in accordance with data which show that water has a negative effect on the e.e. [12]. With respect to the effect of inorganic halides such as NaBr, the question is whether these are irreversibly chemisorbed on the catalyst, blocking certain active sites [2], or whether they are in a reversible equilibrium with 382 TABLE 3 Effect of washing with methanol on the e.e. of 'HaTA/H^O' modified 12 wt.% Ni/SiOz catalystsa MeOH washing time (min) 2 7 15 e.e.

In the latter case, their presence in the reactant solution would be required during hydrogenation. In Table 4 results are compared where during modification in aqueous solution NaBr was present or absent respectively, all catalysts having been washed after these modifications. The resulting values of the e.e.s are virtual- ly equal. Re-modification of modified and washed catalysts, by immersing them in methanolic alkali halide solutions, leads to some significant effects, as presented in Table 5: the e.e. is lowered by LiBr and RbBr, but is increased by Nal. In a third set of experiments, no alkali halide was used during modifica- tion, but NaBr was dissolved in the liquid hydrogenation mixture before adding the catalyst. This led to a significant enhancement of the enantio- selectivity. For instance, for HzTA^O-modified 12 wt.% Ni/SiO; catalysts, for which e.e. values of 24 - 28% (Table 1) were found without added NaBr, values of 38 - 55% were found when the hydrogenation mixture contained dis- solved amounts of NaBr. The enhancement was found to be concentration dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 2 for four differently modified 10 wt.% Ni/- TABLE 5 Effect of re-modification, e.g. extra treatment with a methanolic alkali halide solution after modification, on the e.e. of 'HaTA/H^O' modified 5 wt.% Ni/SiO; catalysts Halide LiBr NaBr RbBr Nal e.e.

Enantioselectivity of modified Ni/SiO^ catalysts as a function of the amount of NaBr added to the hydrogenation mixture. Modifications were carried out with: H/TA/- HiO (a), HzTA/MeOH (0), NiSO^HzTA/MeOH ( ) and NiTA (A). Si02 catalysts. For all four modification procedures, the e.e. passed through a maximum. This maximum became more pronounced when Ni2\"*\" ions were present in the modification solution. Further, it was observed that in the absence of NaBr, the modification with 'NiTA/I^O' was much more efficient (in terms ofe.eJ as compared to the modification with 'NiS04/H2TA/MeOH'. Discussion The effect of the reduction conditions on the e.e. of the catalyst sub- sequently modified is in line with results of other authors who found a signif- icant effect of particle size [13] and particle size distribution [4] on the enantioselectivity. Broadly speaking, such effects appear to reflect the in- fluence of particle morphology on the stereochemistry of reactions on the particle surface. It is conceivable e.g. that two-dimensional layers of nickel tartrate adhere differently on smooth or rough faces of the metal and that edges, comers or steps have a distorting effect on the adsorbed tartrate. We refrain from more detailed speculations here, as we are planning to use Ostwald ripening for a more detailed study of these phenomena. The large effect of the solvent used during modification is remarkable, and so is the finding that modification in methanol leads to any enantio- selectivity at all. Modification in aqueous solution usually implies that some alkali hydroxide has been added to adjust the pH [6], and the question arises whether alkali ions are a prerequisite for obtaining e.e. with tartrate-modified nickel [5b]. The present results, obtained upon modifying in methanol in the absence of alkali, appear to prove for the first time that significant enan- tioselectivity is obtainable without alkali ions. Upon accepting that chemi- sorption of tartaric acid on nickel must be of the corrosive type, it follows that adsorbed nickel tartrate suffices to induce significant enantioselectivity. 384 Independently, we found that no sodium is incorporated into nickel (R,R}- tartrate crystals when these are precipitated from sodium-containing solutions [14]. Another effect of the solvent was reported by Yasumori [15], who reported less adsorption of tartaric acid for modification carried out in 'alcoholic' solutions. If this is correct, one might expect an enhanced activity, since more bare nickel is exposed. Our result, that the activity is actually lowered upon modifying in MeOH compared to H^O, would then have to be interpreted in terms of an inhibiting effect of some reaction intermediate (the reaction order for either reactant or product being > 0 [5b, 7]). As to the action of added alkali halides on the e.e., the present results clearly show that the effect of NaBr vanishes upon thoroughly washing modified catalysts. This result is at variance with observations by Harada for Raney nickel cata- lysts [10, 2]. We do, however, find a strong positive effect of NaBr, if this salt is present in the hydrogenation mixture and this effect clearly depends on the concentration of the dissolved halide. These results lead us to the con- clusion that NaBr is not irreversibly adsorbed on the catalyst, blocking active sites, but that an equilibrium exists of adsorbed and dissolved ions with a low heat of adsorption. The effects further depend on the nature of both the cation and the anion and we shall discuss this in more detail in a subsequent paper[10]. Conclusion The enantio selectivity of tartrate-modified Ni/SiO^ catalysts is sensitive to reduction, washing and promotion procedures in addition to modification conditions. The enantioselectivity of catalysts modified without alkali ions, the comparable e.e. values obtained for catalysts modified with HzTA or NiTA and the similarity of the conditions for producing nickel (R,R )-tartrate and for modifying Ni catalysts suggest that enantioselective sites on the cata- lyst surface are formed by Ni tartrate. The ease with which halides, such as NaBr, are washed off from the catalyst surface, and the concentration dependence of the e.e. on the NaBr content of the hydrogenation mixture show that these halides are reversibly adsorbed; these results are in conflict with the simple model assuming preferential poisoning of non-selective sites.

        "dc:description": "The asymmetric hydrogenation of a prochiral keto compound has been studied using silica-supported nickel catalysts which were ‘modified’ with (R,R)-tartaric acid. The enantiomeric excess is found to increase with the severity of the catalyst reduction. For catalyst modification in aqueous solution an alkali hydroxide is conventionally used to adjust the pH, but this alkali is not a necessary ingredient of the product-determining surface complex, as follows from a significant enantioselectivity found upon modifying in a methanolic solution in the absence of alkali. Halides such as NaBr, when dissolved in the liquid reaction mixture, are reversibly adsorbed on the tartrate-modified nickel surface and alter the enantioselectivity significantly. The results disprove a model which attributed the increase in enantiomeric excess to preferential and irreversible blocking of non-selective sites by the halide. They suggest, rather, that adsorbed ions affect the stereochemistry of the asymmetric surface complex.",
