Sulfur modification can effectively modulate the electronic properties of the active sites on the metal catalysts and thus tune the catalytic performance. In this paper, sulfur-modified Pt/C catalysts were prepared by impregnation with a certain amount of thiourea as the precursor for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (NB) to p-aminophenol (PAP). Under reaction conditions, the highest conversion achieved was 99.5% and the selectivity was 72.5%. The effects of sulfur source type and sulfur content on the structure and physicochemical properties of catalyst support and active site were investigated. Results of XPS, H2-TPD-Mass and IR indicated the presence of strong inter-electron interaction between S and Pt. The sulfur modified catalyst not only reduces the dissociation and adsorption strength of hydrogen by Pt, but also inhibits the adsorption strength of phenylhydroxylamine on the catalyst surface, preventing excessive hydrogenation of phenylhydroxylamine, and prompting Bamberger rearrangement to p-aminophenol.

Conventional methods for synthesizing p-aminophenol, such as iron powder reduction [4] and phenol coupling, have been characterized by excessive energy consumption and severe environmental pollution [5]. To this end, a one-step approach has been proposed for the synthesis of p-aminophenol, which exhibits several advantages, including a reduced process duration, lower pollution levels, and decreased energy consumption by utilizing nitrobenzene as the raw material. The approach is of considerable industrial development value [6]. However, the reaction system is complicated and comprises four distinct phases, namely aqueous, organic, solid, and gaseous phases. The proposed mechanism of the method postulates that nitrobenzene adsorbs onto the catalyst surface to form droplets, and H2 passes through the water/organic phase interface and enters the droplets to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Here, the N-O bond in nitrobenzene undergoes hydrogenation to form the highly unstable intermediate phenylhydroxylamine. A portion of phenylhydroxylamine is desorbed from the catalyst surface in time and subsequently undergoes Bamberger rearrangement under acidic conditions, generating p-aminophenol. In contrast, the undesorbed phenylhydroxylamine undergoes further hydrogenation in the presence of H2 to form aniline, which serves as the first by-product [7]. However, aniline significantly impacts the final yield of p-aminophenol and represents the primary focus of this research topic aimed at enhancing product selectivity [8]. The selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to prepare p-aminophenol typically employs transition metals as catalysts, with Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, and Ni being the most frequently utilized active components [9–11]. While non-precious metal Ni has also been reported as a potential catalyst [12,13], Pt/C is currently considered the most suitable due to its outstanding hydrogenation activity. The active metal plays a critical role in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and the over-hydrogenation of phenyl hydroxylamine. An excessive adsorption strength of the active metal on the intermediate could hinder the transfer of the intermediate between organic and aqueous phases, resulting in over-hydrogenation and reduced selectivity. Conversely, if the adsorption strength of the active metal on the intermediate is too weak, the catalytic activity would be insufficient, leading to inefficient reaction processes. Shubo et al. [45] calculated the hydrogenation process of nitrobenzene and found that different catalyst configurations had different effects on the adsorption strength of intermediates. Yang [26] et al. also used FTIR spectroscopy to further explain the enhancement of selectivity of NB on PAP hydrogenation, the reaction of PHA on different catalyst surfaces, and the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, demonstrating that P doping effectively reduces the adsorption strength of nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxyamine on catalysts. Therefore, the most challenging task lies in tuning the electronic environment of the catalytic center to achieve high selectivity at high activity [14,15]. Many studies have been conducted to improve the selectivity of p-aminophenol, recently, heteroatom doping was reported as an effective way to improve the performance of the catalyst through multiphase catalysis, and selective modifiers such as sulfides and nitrides can modulate the electronic properties of noble metal catalysts [16–22]. Back in 2014, Zhang [23] et al. prepared a series of Ph2S-modified Pd/C catalysts (Pd-Ph2SC) using diphenyl sulfide (Ph2S), and the characterization results revealed that the diphenyl sulfide ligand was mostly adsorbed on the active site of Pd metal, the active site of Pd metal was partially covered and shielded the sites for side-reaction and resulted in high product selectivity. Subsequently, Zhang [24] and his colleagues successfully loaded Pd on S-doped carbon carriers by calcination and adjusted the size of Pd by adjusting the S content, which contributed to the high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. In addition, electron transfer effect was detected between S and Pt, the subsequent change in the adsorption capacity of H2 on Pd was also reported, resulting in efficient catalytic activity with excellent selectivity. Md Ariful Hoque [25] et al. reported a sulfur-doped carbon nanotube (S-CNT) loaded one-dimensional Pt nanowire (PtNW/S-CNT) and found a strong interaction between Pt and S-CNT, electrons transfer from S-CNT to Pt were identified, compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts S-CNT exhibits better long-term stability and significantly higher electrochemical activity for ORR reaction. Yang [26] et al. prepared highly dispersed Pt nanoparticle catalysts loaded on P-doped coconut shell activated carbon (Pt/P-ACC) using a two-step impregnation method, where the interaction between Pt and P species resulted in an electron-rich Pt surface causing reduced adsorption of the electron-rich substrate (benzylamine), resulting in higher activity, chemoselectivity, and reusability. An increasing number of studies have shown that sulfur modifications can effectively modulate the electronic structure of metals and affect the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on catalysts, hence changing the catalytic performance [27–29]. To date, S-modification has not been reported for the preparation of p-aminophenol via the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. This study presents the preparation of sulfur-modified Pt/C catalysts (Pt-S/C) using an impregnation method with thiourea as the precursor. After calcination, strong electronic interactions between S and Pt were observed in Pt-S/C, resulting in appropriate surface adsorption energy and electronic properties. The effects of sulfur species and addition on catalytic activity and chemoselectivity were investigated, and the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed using TEM, XPS, and H2-TPD-Mass techniques. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was explored. 2 Experiments and methods 2.1 Chemicals and materials Reagents used in the synthesis of catalysts include commercial Pt/C catalyst (PC, 3% Pt loading, Sigma-Aldrich), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99%, Macklin), sodium benzenesulfonate (C6H5SO3Na, 97%, Macklin), DL-methionine (CH3SCH2CH2CH(NH2)COOH, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich). Reagents required for catalyst evaluation include nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2, 99%, Macklin), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%−98%, Sinopharm), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 97%, Macklin), p-aminophenol (C6H7NO, ≥98%, HPLC, Macklin), aniline (C6H7N, ≥99.9%, GC, Sinopharm), 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl ether (C12H12N2O, 98%, Macklin), o-aminophenol (C6H7NO, 98%, Sinopharm). 2.2 Catalysts preparation The 3% Pt/C catalyst was used as the original catalyst and pretreated in an oven at 110 ℃ for 10 h to remove moisture. The Sulfur modification was carried out based on 3% Pt/C. Firstly, an appropriate concentration of sulfur precursor was added to 50 mL of deionized water solution (the molar ratio of Pt:S varied between 0.01 and 1) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. After 30 min of sonication, 1 g of 3% Pt/C catalyst was added, and the precursor suspension of 3% Pt/C and sulfur was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and sonicated again for 30 min. Then the obtained solution was filtered and washed with a certain amount of ethanol and deionized water, respectively, and dried in a vacuum oven at 110 ℃ for 8 h. The obtained black powder was kept at 500 ℃ for 4 h under N2 atmosphere in a tube furnace, where the nitrogen flow rate was 50 mL/min and the heating rate was 5 ℃/min, and finally, the sulfur-modified Pt/C catalyst was obtained, labeled as 3% Pt-S(X) /C (X = sulfur source). 2.3 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the catalysts were determined using a fully automatic specific surface and porosity analyzer, Micromeritic ASAP 2020. The catalyst samples were treated at 100 ℃ for 3 h to remove the impurities adsorbed on the surface of the samples. The catalyst samples were pre-piped and degassed for 12 h and then physically adsorbed in liquid nitrogen and the pore size distribution was measured by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Raman spectroscopy (Raman) measurements were performed on a LabRAM Odyssey model Raman spectrometer from Horiba with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The working voltage was 45 kV and the working current was 40 mA. The patterns were collected with a 2θ range from 10◦ to 80◦. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer(Kratos AXOS Ultra DLD) from Shimadzu(Kratos), using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (hν=1486.6 eV, 15 kV and 3 mA). The spectra were corrected for binding energy at the C1 s peak (B.E.=284.8 eV) using a correction for shifts due to positive charge effects. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were recorded on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope, and the size and morphology of Pt particles on the catalyst surface were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at an operating voltage of 300 kV, and the elements were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray energy spectroscopy (EDX). Temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD-Mass) was performed on a VDSorb-91i-MS chemisorption analyzer, model VDSorb, manufactured by Ward Instruments, using H2 as the probe molecule and a detector, model QGAMass, manufactured by Hiden Analytical Ltd. Typically, a 50 mg sample was first pretreated in 100 ℃ Ar for 1 h to remove water from the sample, held at 75 ℃ for 1 h in a 10 vol% H2/Ar atmosphere, and after cooling down to 30 °C in an Ar atmosphere, the sample was ramped up from 30 ℃ to 700 ℃ in an Ar atmosphere in a 5 ℃/min program, and hydrogen desorption was monitored by Mass. The infrared spectroscopy of nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine was performed on the VERTEX 70 V infrared spectrometer produced by Brook Company. Firstly, the catalysts before and after sulfur modification were treated with nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine adsorption, where nitrobenzene was adsorbed by adding 100 mg of both 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) catalysts into a sample tube containing 1 mL of nitrobenzene and 5 mL of anhydrous ethanol, shaking to disperse them evenly, leaving them for 24 h to saturate the adsorption, removing the solvent fraction and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 ℃ for 1 h to obtain the dried sample. For the adsorption of phenylhydroxylamine, 100 mg of 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) catalysts were added into the sample tube containing 100 mg of phenylhydroxylamine and 5 mL of deionized water, shaken and dispersed well, and left to saturate at 3 °C for 24 h. The solvent fraction was removed and the dried sample was freeze-dried in a freeze-dryer at − 47 ℃ for 7 h to obtain the dried sample. The background spectra of the catalysts 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) without nitrobenzene adsorption were first collected under Ar atmosphere, and then the IR spectra of the catalysts 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) with nitrobenzene adsorption pretreatment were examined under Ar atmosphere. Similarly, the IR spectra of phenylhydroxylamine were firstly collected under Ar atmosphere for the catalysts 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) without phenylhydroxylamine adsorption, and then the IR spectra of the catalysts 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) with phenylhydroxylamine adsorption pretreatment were conducted under Ar atmosphere. 2.4 Hydrogenation tests All the hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 250 mL hastelloy autoclave of Yanzhen Instruments. 25.3 g of nitrobenzene (NB), 0.4 g of catalyst, 0.25 g of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), 14 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 126 mL of deionized water were evenly dispersed in the reaction kettle, and the air inside the kettle was firstly replaced with N2 five times, the gas tightness of the kettle was checked. The hydrogen pressure was set at 1.0 MPa. The reaction temperature was set at 75 ℃ during the reaction. When the hydrogen pressure was lower than 0.7 MPa, the hydrogen was added to 1.0 MPa and the amount of hydrogen consumed in the reaction was recorded. Hydrogen consumption was calculated as: 0.3 *n (n = hydrogen refill times). When the hydrogen pressure no longer drops, the reaction is over. After the reaction, the reaction solution was filtered and diluted with a homemade mobile phase solution and transferred to a 250 mL volumetric flask (mobile phase: acetonitrile: water: isopropanol=500:450:50, and 2.91 g of ammonium acetate was added), and the catalyst was recovered. The products were quantified by Agilent liquid chromatography. The high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on a 4.6 mm * 150 mm (5 µm) C18 reversed column, mobile phase A was set to be isopropanol, mobile phase B was acetonitrile, mobile phase C was ammonium acetate, and the gradient elution was used to make the proportion of ammonium acetate decrease from 85% to 10% within 25 min, the proportion of acetonitrile increase from 10% to 85% within 25 min. The flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min, the column temperature was 30 ℃, and the detection wavelength of UV detector was 254 nm. 3 Results and discussion The pore structure of the catalyst carbon carriers was analyzed by N2 physical adsorption-desorption method. The N2 adsorption isotherms of all samples are shown in Fig. 1a. All four catalysts exhibited the characteristics of type I isotherms and significant capillary condensation at P/P0 < 0.05 [30], indicating the presence of abundant micropores in the carbon carriers of this catalyst. From the parameters in Table 1, it can be seen that the carbon carriers of 3% Pt/C, 3% Pt-S(sodium benzenesulfonate)/C, 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C, and 3% Pt-S(methionine)/C have a higher specific surface area, exposing more active sites and contributing to the uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles. Additionally, the pore volume and pore size of 3% Pt/C remained largely unaffected after sulfur modification, indicating that the different sulfur sources and the sulfur modification effect did not significantly alter the surface state of the carbon carriers [31]. To further evaluate the effect of sulfur modification on the structure of carbon carriers, Raman spectroscopy was performed to analyze the microstructure of Pt nanoparticles on carbon carriers after modification with different sulfur sources. As shown in Fig. 1b, where there are two distinct peaks at about 1342 cm −1 and 1590 cm −1, corresponding to the vibration of graphitic carbon crystalline edges and the planar motion of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms on ideal carbon planes, respectively [32,33], the ID/IG of 3% Pt/C, 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C, 3% Pt-S(methionine)/C, and 3% Pt-S(sodium benzenesulfonate)/C ratios were 2.78, 2.76, 2.70, and 2.88. The ID/IG values of the four were the same, all of which were carbon materials with the high disorder, indicating that the degree of defects and graphitization of the catalyst carbon carriers were relatively large, and the heteroatom doping had less influence on the carbon carriers, which was consistent with the N2 physical adsorption-desorption results. The morphology and structure and elemental composition of the samples were studied by TEM and EDX analysis. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, both 3% Pt/C, and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C catalysts showed similar morphologies and structures. Fig. 2c and d show that Pt is uniformly dispersed on the carbon carrier surface in both samples, Pt nanoparticles are highly dispersed, and the average particle size of Pt metal in 3% Pt/C, 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C catalysts is 2.67 nm and 2.96 nm, respectively, indicating that the basic structure of the catalysts is not destroyed after calcination. We calculated the lattice spacing for the two samples separately. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, the lattice spacings of 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C were 0.236 nm and 0.231 nm, respectively, which were attributed to the (111) crystal plane of Pt, indicating that the crystal plane type of the catalyst was not destroyed before and after the modification. EDS analysis is shown in Fig. 2g and h. The mass ratios of C and Pt in 3% Pt/C were 98.64% and 1.36%. The mass ratios of C, S, and Pt in 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C were 96.4%, 1.0%, and 2.6%. This gives a good correspondence between the distribution of Pt species and the distribution of S species, demonstrating that S species were successfully introduced into the catalyst [34–36]. To provide additional confirmation of the impact of both sulfur modification and heat treatment processes on the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, we conducted an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the catalysts both prior to and following sulfur modification ( Fig. 3). Our observations indicated that all samples exhibited two broad diffraction peaks at 23° and 43°, with no discernible Pt diffraction peaks present, suggesting that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly distributed across the surface of the carbon carrier. These findings were consistent with those obtained via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and provide further evidence that sulfur modification did not alter the catalysts grain size or lattice type, as previously demonstrated [37]. We then investigated the effect of the type of sulfur source and the amount of sulfur modifier added on the reaction selectivity and activity. From the evaluation results in Table 2, it can be seen that under the conditions of different sulfur source modifications, the four sample catalysts of 3% Pt/C, 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C, 3% Pt-S(methionine)/C, and 3% Pt-S(sodium benzenesulfonate)/C catalysts all achieved more than 99.5% conversion, and nitrobenzene was almost completely converted, and the unmodified sulfur modified Pt/C catalyst had a higher high catalytic activity, the complete reaction time was only 52 min, but the selectivity to aminophenol was only 39.2%. We found that the modification of different sulfur sources suppressed the activity of Pt/C catalysts, and the complete reaction times of the catalysts modified with thiourea, sodium benzenesulfonate and methionine required 128, 137 and 130 min, respectively, the selectivity corresponding to the three sulfur-modified catalysts were all improved to different degrees, especially the thiourea-modified Pt/C catalyst with a selectivity of 72.5%. The large improvement compared to Pt/C catalysts suggests that different sulfur sources have different degrees of modification of Pt species, and there are also differences in the chemical state and chemical groups of S doping on the catalysts, so we choose the thiourea with the best catalytic selectivity and proper catalytic activity for the ratio regulation. In order to examine the effect of sulfur modifier addition on the catalyst performance, we also see from Table 2 that with the increase of thiourea content, the catalyst complete reaction time was extended from 117 min, 128 min to the final loss of reactivity of the catalyst, however, the selectivity showed a trend of volcano type curve, where the highest was reached at 10 times of Pt metal molar amount of sulfur modifier addition 72.5% selectivity, indicating that during the change of different sulfur modifier additions, thiourea may modulate the electronic structure and dissociative hydrogen adsorption ability of Pt through strong interelectronic interactions between Pt and S, thus improving the catalytic performance of the catalyst. It has been shown that S interacts strongly with Pt so that S adsorbs preferentially on the surface of Pt species, which not only causes changes in the catalyst structure but also adjusts the electronic configuration of the catalyst metal active site, resulting in the gain or loss of electrons in the metal d-band orbitals [38]. To investigate the effect of heteroatom doping and addition on the charge transfer between Pt and S, we performed an XPS characterization. We corrected the binding energy based on the C1 s line at 284.8 eV. To investigate the bonding configuration and chemical state of S in the heteroatom-doped catalyst, it is clear from the XPS spectrum of high-resolution S2p ( Fig. 4) that S can be deconvoluted into three components, mainly of C-S-C (165.2 eV), the thiophene-like structure of the C-SOX group (∼168.5 eV) [39–41] and the peak in the S 2p region at 163.9 eV correspond to S2p1/2 in PtS[50]. The peak area ratio between PtS and C-S-C was 2.63, and these results indicate that S was successfully doped onto the catalyst metal surface. The Pt4 f spectra of 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S (thiourea)/C catalysts with different sulfur contents are shown in Fig. 5(a–d). Four peak positions appear for each catalyst, where the two sharp peaks at 71.8 eV and 75.1 eV for the 3% Pt/C catalyst are both attributed to the more active zero-valent Pt, while the satellite peaks at 72.8 eV and 76.2 eV are attributed to the less active divalent Pt. As can be seen by Fig. 5, when the S addition is less, compared to the 3% Pt/C catalyst the Pt4 f spectra of 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C did not undergo a significant shift, but with the increase of S content up to ten times, all four binding energy positions of Pt underwent a positive shift of 0.1 eV, and when the S content increased up to 100 times, the binding energy positions of Pt4f5/2 and Pt4f7/2 of 3%Pt-S/C were shifted by 0.5 eV relative to 3% Pt/C toward the higher binding energy [42,43]. It can be seen that after the sulfur modification of 3% Pt/C, and the binding energy of Pt shifts in the direction of high binding energy, resulting in a partial shift of Pt from the low valence state to the high valence state, thus indicating the existence of strong interelectronic interactions between Pt and S, which also affects the catalyst activity and chemical selectivity, which will be discussed later. In the hydrogenation reaction, it is often the low-valent zero-valent Pt that plays a dominant role, so with the addition of sulfur modifier, the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is suppressed, further hindering the excessive hydrogenation of the intermediate phenylhydroxylamine, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity of the catalyst during the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene versus an increase in the selectivity of p-aminophenol. The adsorption and dissociation behavior of sulfur (S) as well as its impact on the adsorption of hydrogen (H2) on the catalyst surface were investigated via hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (H2-TPD-Mass). As shown in Fig. 6, only one desorption peak was observed for each sample between 300 ℃ and 500 ℃, which was attributed to the chemical desorption of H2. Our findings revealed that, as the S addition increased, the chemical desorption peak of H2 gradually shifted to lower temperatures, from approximately 420 ℃ to 350 ℃, with a concurrent reduction in peak area. These observations suggest that the adsorption intensity of Pt on H2 weakened with the increase of sulfur modifier. Moreover, the efficient hydrogenation activity of the Pt/C catalyst resulted in a high concentration of phenylhydroxylamine on the catalyst surface, which could not be removed in a timely manner, leading to a low reaction selectivity. This outcome was attributed to the further hydrogenation of phenylhydroxylamine, catalyzed by the highly active Pt sites, which produced aniline as a by-product. The S-modified Pt/C catalyst exhibits partial S occupancy at the active site, resulting in the production of high-valent Pt that hinders the catalyst's ability to dissociate hydrogen and adsorb intermediates. As a consequence, the rate of phenylhydroxylamine production and its relative concentration on the catalyst's active site surface are reduced, Wang [46] et al. proposed that in nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction, hydrogen dissociation is the rate-determining step of the reaction, so the inhibition of hydrogen dissociation and adsorption by sulfur-modified catalyst will greatly affect the selectivity of p-aminophenol. This inhibition of H2 activation dissociation and adsorption strength of Pt, as observed in the H2-TPD-Mass results, is attributed to an electronic effect between Pt and S, where S attracts outer electrons of Pt to assume a higher valence state. This electronic effect constitutes the primary reason for reduced hydrogenation activity and increased selectivity of nitrobenzene [44]. In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to p-aminophenol, we investigated the adsorption properties of nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine on different catalyst surfaces using infrared spectroscopy. Fig. 7a depicts the adsorption of nitrobenzene on 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S (thiourea)/C(10) catalysts. The vibration bands of the nitro group at 1348 cm−1 and 1523 cm−1 were observed on the 3% Pt/C surface, while on the 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) surface, the vibration bands of the nitro group were observed at 1346 cm−1 and 1519 cm−1. This indicates that there is an interaction between the two catalysts and the nitro group, and the adsorption strength of the nitro group is inhibited on the sulfur-modified catalyst surface [47]. In Fig. 7b, the adsorption of phenylhydroxylamine on the 3% Pt/C and 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) catalysts are shown. The vibration band of phenylhydroxylamine at 1438 cm−1 was observed on the 3% Pt/C surface, we also observed a band at another 1474 cm−1 of the benzene ring while no obvious vibration band was observed on the 3% Pt-S(thiourea)/C(10) surface. This suggests that the sulfur modification of the 3% Pt/C catalyst inhibited the adsorption of phenylhydroxylamine on the catalyst surface [48,49]. Based on the IR results, we conclude that the sulfur-modified catalyst can effectively reduce the adsorption strength of nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine on the catalyst surface, allowing phenylhydroxylamine to desorb in a timely manner and undergo Bamberger rearrangement to generate p-aminophenol in the sulfuric acid phase. As a result, the selectivity of p-aminophenol is significantly improved by preventing excessive hydrogenation to aniline. 4 Conclusion This paper presents the development of an efficient sulfur-doped Pt/C catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to produce p-aminophenol with high activity and selectivity. The inspiration for this S-doping approach comes from the toxicizing behavior of sulfur species on the active site. In this study, we utilized this toxicizing behavior by deliberately sacrificing the dissociation and hydrogen adsorption ability of the active site of the conventional Pt/C catalyst to create a relatively low concentration hydrogen environment. This strategy effectively reduces the adsorption strength of the generated intermediates on the catalyst surface and prevents the reaction intermediates from over-hydrogenating on the catalyst surface to produce byproduct aniline. Furthermore, the strong inter-electron interaction between Pt and S facilitated the transfer of electrons from Pt to S, which reduced the electron cloud density on the Pt surface, resulting in an increase in the number of less active high-valent Pt. This reduction in hydrogenation activity led to a decrease in by-product generation and achieved high selectivity for aminophenol. Overall, this catalyst development strategy successfully demonstrated its general applicability and potential for selective hydrogenation reactions.

        "dc:description": "Sulfur modification can effectively modulate the electronic properties of the active sites on the metal catalysts and thus tune the catalytic performance. In this paper, sulfur-modified Pt/C catalysts were prepared by impregnation with a certain amount of thiourea as the precursor for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (NB) to p-aminophenol (PAP). Under reaction conditions, the highest conversion achieved was 99.5% and the selectivity was 72.5%. The effects of sulfur source type and sulfur content on the structure and physicochemical properties of catalyst support and active site were investigated. Results of XPS, H2-TPD-Mass and IR indicated the presence of strong inter-electron interaction between S and Pt. The sulfur modified catalyst not only reduces the dissociation and adsorption strength of hydrogen by Pt, but also inhibits the adsorption strength of phenylhydroxylamine on the catalyst surface, preventing excessive hydrogenation of phenylhydroxylamine, and prompting Bamberger rearrangement to p-aminophenol.",
