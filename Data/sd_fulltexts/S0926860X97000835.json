The metal-PVP particles were anchored onto the surface of water insoluble, crosslinked poly(2- vinylpyrrolidone), PVPP. Both the sols and the supported catalysts are stable in time, non-permeable to the lipid membrane, and can be separated completely from the reaction mixture by decantation or centrifugation. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Hydrogenation of biological membranes may influ- ence many important functions of the cells and may give useful information about their physical state and the role the biomembranes play in certain important physiological processes of the living cells, such as cold acclimation and heat shock tolerance [1-3]. The fluidity of lipid membranes is largely determined by *Corresponding author. IFor Part 1 see [27]. the unsaturation of the fatty acyl chains of the polar lipid constituents. The objective of biomembrane hydrogenations is in the selective reduction of the C=C double bonds in unsaturated lipids with no concomitant isomerization or chain fission, or re- actions of other constituents of the cell membrane (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.). Therefore one of the most important tasks is the choice of a suitable catalyst, capable to achieve 10-20% saturation of the lipids under mild conditions with short reaction times. In addition, the catalyst must not be toxic and water sensitive (stability to air is also preferable) and should be removable after hydrogenation [4]. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00083-5 58 L. Ncidasdi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997)57~59 In the earlier studies several homogeneous catalysts (e.g. RhCI(TPPMS)3, RuClz(TPPMS)2, Pd(QS)2; TPPMS=monosulfonated triphenylphosphine, QS= 1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone-3-sulfonic acid, alizarin red) were applied for membrane modification [5]. Efforts were made for surface selective hydro- genation to modify exclusively the plasma membrane or its external leaflet without the catalyst penetrating into the cells. With careful choice of the reaction time limited selectivity could be achieved, however, diffusion of the catalyst into the internal leaflet of the membrane could not be prevented and the catalysts could not be washed out completely from the membranes after hydrogenation. Among the heterogeneous catalysts, PtO2, Adam's catalyst was used for such purpose, but showed low activity [6]. Soluble, ionic catalysts like those dis- cussed above were anchored onto the surface of various ion exchanger supports (e.g. RuC12(TPPMS)2 on Molselect DEAE or Pd(QS)2 on Sephadex QAE). Although these heterogenized systems have retained their activity in hydrogenation of polar lipids, the liposomes and biomembranes adsorbed strongly onto the catalyst surface and separation was not possible without loosing the integrity of the membrane [7]. Some years ago we reported the use of metallic palladium precipitated onto cross-linked poly(2-vinyl- pyrrolidone) in biomembrane hydrogenation [8]. This Pd-PVPP catalyst was suitable for hydrogenation of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes and the thylakoid membrane of a blue-green alga, Syne- chocystis PCC 6803. The same Pd-PVPP catalyst was used for selective surface hydrogenation of rat plate- lets in order to study the processes during platelet activation and aggregation leading to re-distribution of the fatty acid residues originally residing in the inter- nal leaflet of the plasma membrane during platelet activation and aggregation [9]. Although this type of Pd-PVPP was found non-permeable, active and cell surface-selective, the strong adsorption of lipids and membranes onto the catalyst could not be avoided. In addition, rather poor reproducibility was observed, most probably because of the uncontrolled size and the morphology of the catalyst particles. Although colloidal catalysts attract continous atten- tion [10-26], to our knowledge no application is published on catalytic modification of biological samples (other than [8,9]). Aimed at biomembrane hydrogenation, we report here the use of polyvinyl- pyrrolidone protected palladium, palladium-rhodium and palladium-platinum catalysts which consist of largely uniform, nanosize metal particles. These col- loidal catalysts could be easily anchored onto the surface of water-insoluble PVPE Both the fine col- loidal dispersions and the supported metal catalysts allowed hydrogenation of phospholipid model mem- branes (liposomes) under gentle conditions with no adsorption of the substrate. The basic catalytic proper- ties of the catalysts were characterized in hydro- genation of homogeneous aqueous solutions of crotonic acid. Some of the results were published in preliminary form [27]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials All the reagents were commercial products of Aldrich or Sigma, purified by recrystallization or distillation when necessary. (NHa)2PdCI4 was a loan from Johnson-Matthey. PVP of different molar weight and the water-insoluble PVPP were purchased from Aldrich and Fluka, respectively. Deuterium gas (99.98%) was the product of Linde. Soy-bean lecithin (Lucas-Mayer, Germany) was obtained from a local pharmacy. 2.2. Preparation of Pd-PVP, PdPt-PVP and PdRh-PVP The preparation of Pd-PVP was based on the work of Porta et al. [28] and Bradley et al. [29]. 33.7 mg (0.15mmol) palladium-acetate (or 42.7mg tetra- chloro-ammonium-palladate) and 375 mg water-solu- ble polyvinylpyrrolidone (average MW=24000 or 360000) were dissolved in 125 ml of ethanol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 rain to dissolve all the palladium salt during which its color turned grayish-black. The solution was refluxed for 2 h using an electric heating mantle then cooled in an ice bath and the ethanol was evaporated on a rotavapor. The shiny dark-metallic product (400 mg) could be easily dispersed in aqueous or ethanolic solutions. PdPt-PVP and PdRh-PVP bimetallic catalysts were prepared as above but we used aqueous solutions L. N6dasdi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 57~69 59 (19.3 mmol/dm3) of H2PtC16 as platinum and solid RhC13.xH20 as rhodium source. The water content of the Rh salt (27.6%) was determined by thermogravi- metry on a Mettler TA3000 instrument. 2.3. Preparation of Pd-PVPP, PdPt-PVPP and PdRh-PVPP The same procedure was used as for the preparation of Pd-PVP (Section 2.2) except that the standard mixture contained 700 mg of water-insoluble poly- vinylpyrrolidone (PVPP), too. After cooling in ice the mixture was filtered and the solid product was dried at room temperature. Traces of acetic acid (in case of palladium acetate starting material) were removed by prolonged pumping in vacuo. It is of interest to note that these supported catalysts could not be prepared by heating ethanolic or aqueous solutions of previously isolated metal-PVP in the presence of PVPP. 2.4. Determination of size distribution and the surface charge Dynamic light scattering measurements were used to determine the size distribution of the catalysts (Brookhaven BI-200 SM instrument, A=632.8 nm). The formation of metal particles was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. A drop of Pd-PVP dispersion prepared in a 6% collodium-94% amyl acetate solution was deposited onto the surface of water and the resulting film was transferred onto a carbon supported Cu mesh. This sample was examined with a JEOL 2000 FX II transmission electron micro- scope operating at 200 kV. We used the enlarged TEM photos to determine the size distribution. The surface charge of the catalysts was determined using a Brookhaven ZetaPlus zeta potential analyzer with Au and Pd electrodes. 2.5. Determination of metal content Pd, Pt and Rh content of the samples was deter- mined on a Spectra A-10 atomic absorption spectro- photometer or a Spectroflame ICP AS equipment (Apa=340.5 nm, A~,t=265.9 nm, ARh=343.5 nm). Concentrated H2SO4 and H202 were used to digest the heterogenized catalysts for the ICP measurements. 2.6. Thermal stability The thermal stability of the catalysts was deter- mined by differential thermogravimetry in N2 atmo- sphere at 25-200 using a Mettler TA3000 instrument. 2.7. Hydrogenation experiments In the reaction of crotonic acid, the hydrogen uptake was measured in a gas burette at constant pressure and temperature [30]. A 0.25 M aqueous solution of cro- tonic acid was titrated with 0.2 M of NaOH solution until pH=7.00, and 5 or 10 ml of this solution was placed into the jacketed reaction flask. The latter was filled with H2 by several evacuation/refill cycles. The reactions were started by adding 100 ~1 of aqueous metal-PVP solution (50mg/ml) to the substrate (molc=c/molpo= 1134). The initial rates were obtained from volume readings in the first 5 min, and repeated experiments yielded initial rates within 5% margin. The same reactor was used for hydrogenation of liposomes. In a typical reaction 5 mg of soy-bean lecithin or dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was dispersed in 10 ml of sodium-phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH=7.00) using a Branson SONIFIER 250 instrument (3.2 min, output power=5), and the cata- lyst was added under hydrogen either in solution (50 ~tl, 50 mg/ml) or as a solid (100 mg) from a small paper cup (molc=c/mOlpd=l 8.2). Following hydroge- nation, the fatty acid distribution was determined by gas chromatography (HP 5890 Series II, SP 2330 column, l--30 m, FID, T-190, isothermal) follow- ing transesterification with HC1/MeOH [31]. Since FID sensitivity is practically the same for C16-C18 fatty acid methyl esters the distribution of fatty acids is represented by area% of their peaks on the chromato- grams. Conversion was calculated for total number of C=C double bonds carried by unsaturated fatty acids in the initial and hydrogenated samples. 2.8. Deuteration studies Deuteration activity of the catalysts was studied in reactions such as those in Section 2.6 replacing H20 by D20 and/or H2 by D2. Distribution of deuterium was calculated from IH and 13C NMR spectra obtained on a Bruker WP 360 SY instrument with J 60 L.

Preparation and characterization A series of well defined Pd-PVP catalysts was prepared by heating Pd(CH3COO)2 or (NH4)2PdC14 in ethanol in the presence of water-soluble PVP. Some of the characteristic data of the products including the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles determined by dynamic light scattering measurements are shown in Table 1. We used enlarged TEM photos, too, to obtain the size distribution of the individual metal particles. As expected they were smaller (5 nm, Pd-PVP I) than the hydrodynamic ones. In general, the properties of the catalysts were not influenced by the choice of the palladium source, however, the average diameter of the colloidal particles was shifted to larger values with increasing molecular weight of the PVP used (360 000 vs. 24 000). The effective diameter of the particles was always below 100 nm, but ca. 1-5% of the colloidal dispersion could be found in the ~tm size range (Fig. 1). This fraction, which may be formed by aggregation of the small particles, could be easily removed by filtration through a Millipore 0.22 ~m membrane filter or by centrifugation at 47000 g for 20 min as shown by subsequent light scattering measurements. We also prepared a series of bimetallic catalysts with varying molar proportion of palladium-rhodium and palladium-platinum (selected examples are shown in Table 1). Although the effective diameter of PdRh alloy particles increases with the Rh content, all bimetallic samples are characterized by a <100 nm size and a relatively narrow size distribution similar to their monometallic counterparts. The metal/PVP ratio did not have a significant influence on the size dis- tribution. In all the above cases the catalysts could be isolated from aqueous or ethanolic dispersions by evaporating the solvent in vacuo and the dry residue could be freely redispersed in water or alcohol without measurable change in the physical properties. Ageing of the redispersed aqueous solutions of PVP-protected col- loids or the solids obtained by evaporation was not observed for several months, and we used some of the batches for about a year. Again, the Pd-Pt or Pd-Rh ratio or the metal/PVP proportion did not influence the aggregation properties allowing preparation of stable alloy dispersions on the whole mole fraction scale. According to the zeta potential determinations all the metal(s)-PVP catalysts are uncharged (zero zeta potential). DTG measurements showed a minor weight loss (drying; 1.2-2.3% of various samples) in the 25- 150 temperature range. Above 180 significant gradual loss of weight was recorded owing to decom- position of the protecting PVP layer. These data show that while metal-PVP catalysts are stable in the Table 1 Some mono- and bimetallic PVP and PVPP stabilized colloidal catalysts Type of catalyst MWpvp (103) PVPP content Pd source Metal content (w/w %) Size distributiona (nm) Pd-PVP I 24 None Pd(CH3COOH)2 Pd: 4.7 6-40 Pd-PVP II 360 None Pd(CH3COOH)2 Pd: 4.2 40-70 Pd-PVP III 24 None (NH4)2PdC14 Pd: 4.4 50-100 Pt-PVP 24 None -- Pt: 2.8 n.d.

It is noted here that the size of the soluble metal- PVP particles is smaller than that of an intact living cell (>1)am) and in principle such particles may be internalized by passive or active mechanisms. For selective cell surface hydrogenations it was therefore important to anchor our colloidal catalysts onto a macroheterogeneous, biocompatible support with a hydrophilic surface. We have found that crosslinked, water-insoluble poly(2-vinylpyrrolidone), PVPP is perfectly suited for this purpose, and both the mono- and the bimetallic PVP-protected particles could be deposited on this support as described in Section 2. However, even a large amount of PVPP did not adsorb all the PVP-protected colloid particles formed during the preparation and about 50 times more metal could be found in the alcoholic supernatant than on the surface of the carrier. Therefore, the average metal content of the macroheterogenized catalysts is much less than the corresponding metal-PVP preparations (Table 1), although this does not necessarily reflect the surface concentration of the catalytically active par- ticles. These macroheterogeneous catalysts can be removed from aqueous or alcoholic dispersions by simple filtration or even by decantation. 3.2. Hydrogenation of soluble substrates Both the colloidal metal-PVP dispersions and their PVPP-supported derivatives were found to be active catalysts for hydrogenation of C=C double bonds of several water soluble unsaturated substrates under atmospheric pressure at 37. Relative rates of such hydrogenations catalyzed by Pd-PVP I are shown in Table 2. As expected, substrates with more substituted C=C bonds react slower and there is only a slight difference in the hydrogenation rate of cis-butene dioic (maleic) and trans-butene dioic (fumaric) acid. In contrast to the C=C unsaturated substrates, 2-oxo- carboxylic acids were not hydrogenated by these stabilized Pd sols. During the reaction the solutions looked homogeneous (transparent) and no macro- scopic aggregation, precipitation or other visible change was observed. 62 L.

Details of the catalytic properties of the Pd-PVP colloids were studied in the hydrogenation of homo- geneous solutions of crotonic acid. The reaction is of first order with respect to the Pd-PVP concentration (Fig. 2) and levels off with increasing crotonic acid concentration. The catalytic activity of Pd-PVP is independent of the molecular weight of PVP or the source of palladium but depends on the ratio of metal/ A: General 162 (1997) 57~9 PVP (Fig. 3). The activity of different colloidal cata- lysts increase in the order platinum < palladium < rhodium (Table 3), which is consistent with the results reported by Hirai et al. [10,11]. Hydrogenation of sensitive biological samples (especially that of isolated membrane fractions) require most active catalysts to allow manipulations in the shortest time and at the lowest temperature possible. With this aim in mind, we prepared a series of bimetallic colloidal catalysts by simultaneous reduction of palladium+platinum and palladium+ rhodium salts in the presence of PVP [32]. In order to characterize the catalytic activity, sols prepared with these alloys were applied for the hydrogenation Table 3 Comparison of the activity of different PVP supported metal colloids in hydrogenation of crotonic acid Catalyst PtPVP PdPVP RhPVP Rate (TO/h) 432 490 854 Conditions: C~at=l.0 mg/ml, Csubstrate--0.25 M, pH=7.0, T-37. ml/min 1.5 1.2 0.9 0.6 0.3 i 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 concentration of PdPVP [mg/ml] Fig. 2.

Turnover frequencies are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the composition of the bi- metallic colloids (the total molar amount of the metals were kept constant for the comparison, 2 ~tmol metal/ mg PVP). Very importantly, the bimetallic catalysts were always more active than the corresponding monometallic ones. For both the Pd-Rh and the Pd-Pt alloys the activity shows a maximum as a function of the metal composition; the highest value was obtained at 1 : 1 Pd : Pt and 3 : 2 Pd : Rh molar ratio. At this composition PdRh-PVP was about twice as active as PdPt-PVP with the same mole fraction of Pd, and three times more active than monometallic Pd-PVP. Addition of some common components of the cell culture media, 4.5% of saccharose or sorbitol or 0.9% of NaC1 did not result in any change in the rate of crotonic acid hydrogenation catalyzed by Pd-PVP. On the other hand, bovine serum albumin (BSA) sharply inhibited the reaction: only 2.5% of the uninhibited reaction rate could be measured with 1.2% of BSA present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 5). Prehydro- genation of the catalyst for 30 or 60 min before addition of the substrate did not accelerate the reac- tion. It is important to notice that these catalysts are sufficiently active in the physiological temperature range and even close 0 (Fig. 6). As described in Section 3.1, these palladium sols usually contain 1-5% fraction of particles with size in the 0.7-1.1 ~tm range. To test the contribution of this fraction to the overall catalytic activity we compared the colloidal solutions of the Pd-PVP catalyst before and after filtering through a Millipore 0.22 ~tm mem- brane filter in hydrogenation of crotonic acid under conditions described in the legend of Table 2. The catalytic activity was the same for both the unfiltered and filtered catalyst solutions within experimental error of rate determination (5%). Catalytic deuteration of the unsaturated lipids is an important method of rendering the biomembranes amenable to structural studies by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [33,34] and can be achieved by using either D2 or D20 as deuterium source [35].

It is seen that while c~-acetamidocinnamic acid is 100% deuterated on both the c~ and fl carbon atoms, there was a substantial incorporation of H into the product butyric and methylsuccinic acids. Since H can originate only from the solution phase one has to assume either an H/D exchange on the catalyst or a hydrogenation mechanism requiring protonolysis of some intermediates. However, using H2 and D20 labelling of the products was not observed at all, in sharp contrast to the Dz/H20 case! At the moment we do not have an explanation for this obvious contra- diction. Special mention is deserved of the multiple deuteration of the methyl group in methylsuccinic acid as a result of reducing itaconic acid with De in H20 with Pd-PVP catalyst. Although the mechanism of our process is not clear, similar observations have already been published in homogeneous catalytic deuterations [36]. 3.3. Hydrogenation of lipid dispersions Aqueous dispersions (liposomes) of dioleoylpho- sphatidyl choline (DOPC) and soy-bean lecithin, as models for more complex biological membranes, were hydrogenated with the PVP-protected metal colloids.

Pd-PVP catalyzed the hydrogenation of soy-bean lecithin under mild conditions (Table 5), The kinetics of this reaction showed no unusual features, in 10- 20 min 5-18% of conversion could be achieved (con- ditions are the same as described in Fig. 7). It is commonly observed that in hydrogenations under the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition tempera- ture of the lipid membranes (-20 in case of DOPC liposomes [37]) the overall conversion levels off around 50-60% which corresponds to the complete hydrogenation of lipids in the outer leaflet of the membrane (Fig. 7). Importantly, the reaction rate was not influenced by the pH in the range pH of 5- 8 (Table 6). Generally, polyunsaturated substrates can be hydro- genated faster than monounsaturated ones, and accordingly, DOPC is usually saturated with a lower rate than soy-bean lecithin. Nevertheless, in our case Pd-PVP catalyzed the hydrogenation of DOPC lipo- somes (Table 7) with turnover frequencies compar- able to those observed with the lecithin. 66 L.

The 5-20% conversion of the unsaturated fatty acyl moieties in the two lipids with low catalyst concen- tration and under mild conditions allows meaningful saturation of the biological membranes in short re- action times. This has actually been achieved with samples such as thylakoid membranes from blue- green algae and intact living cells - the results will be published in forthcoming parts of this series. The activity of the macroheterogeneous metal(s)- PVPP catalysts depend on their metal composition and Table 8 Hydrogenation of soy-bean lecithin with Pd-PVPP I, dependence of conversion on amount of catalyst Catalyst (mg) 100 200 300 Conversion (%) at 2 h 7.9 10.0 19.7 Conditions: Ccat=0.25 mg/ml, Csubstrate=0.15 mg/ml, pH=7.0, T--37'~C. on the metal/support ratio. Due to its low Pd content higher amounts of Pd-PVPP are required to achieve similar saturation of soy-bean lecithin than with Pd- PVP (Table 8). However, the moderate activity of our macroheterogeneous catalysts is still sufficient for proper modification of the fluidity of some cell mem- branes, as exemplified by the selective surface hydro- genation of Synechocystis PCC 6803 ([38], detailed results will be published later). 3.4. Adsorption and separation properties In the usual laboratory practice the amount of the substrate or products retained on the catalyst surface is L.

However, in biomembrane modifi- cations the amount of the sample is in most cases rather limited and its adsorption can lead to substantial and irreproducible changes in the composition of the reaction mixture. Consequently, strong adsorption of lipids, membraneous cell components or whole cells on the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst is an unwanted phenomenon which may completely pre- vent the use of the particular catalyst for hydrogena- tion of such samples. In order to estimate the extent of adsorption of lipids on our supported metal-PVP catalysts, we added known amounts of pentadecanoic acid, 15 : 0 (internal standard, not contained in the substrate) to the hydro- genated soy-bean lecithin samples before transester- ification for gas chromatography. It could be shown this way that more than 95% of the soy-bean lecithin (5 mg) was recovered from a hydrogenation with a relatively large amount of macroheterogeneous Pd- PVPP (300 mg) which was removed by centrifugation after the reaction. These data demonstrate very sub- stantial improvements compared to the previously studied heterogeneous and heterogenized homoge- neous catalysts mentioned in Section 114-9]. The metal(s)-PVP catalysts present in the reaction mixture in the form of colloidal dispersions could not be separated from the water-soluble substrates by simple filtration and even during ultracentrifugation these catalysts could be settled from aqueous solutions only at around 100 000 g. However, this latter property allows the separation of the cells or other membrane fractions from the catalysts since the former can be recovered by centrifugation typically at 10-50 000 g. 4. Conclusions Polyvinylpyrrolidone protected monometallic (Pd- PVP, Pt-PVP, Rh-PVP) and bimetallic (PdPt-PVP, PdRh-PVP) colloids were prepared and used as cata- lysts for hydrogenation. The catalyst particles are in the nanosize range and characterized by relatively narrow size distribution. Such uniformity manifests itself in highly reproducible catalytic activity. The 68 L. Nddasdi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 57~59 colloid particles can be isolated as a solid powder upon evaporation of the solvent and can be redispersed freely in water, i.e. no aggregation takes place during isolation. Similarly, the aqueous dispersions do not show noticeable ageing either. Although the mono- metallic catalysts themselves show high catalytic activity in hydrogenation of water soluble olefins a strong synergism is observed in case of the Pd-Pt and Pd-Rh bimetallic preparations in that the catalytic activity shows a maximum value as a function of the catalyst composition. In addition to soluble sub- strates lipid dispersions prepared from soy-bean lecithin or dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine could be hydrogenated under mild conditions showing that a membraneous structure of the olefinic substrate does not hinder the reaction. The above nanosize particles can be deposited on the surface of water insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone resulting in macroheterogeneous supported hydroge- nation catalysts. It is important to note that this support is biocompatible and has a hydrophilic surface. Despite the low metal loadings which were achieved in this study the supported catalysts showed sufficient turnover frequencies in hydrogenation of water solu- ble unsaturated acids and of lipid dispersions. Another very promising feature of these new cata- lysts is that neither the nanosize nor the macrohetero- geneous particles adsorb the phospholipids used in this study. The protecting polymer covering the sur- face of the metal particles is considered not only the agent preventing the aggregation of the colloidal dispersions but also the one providing the catalyst with low adsorption properties. Although it is not the only property governing aggregation and adsorption we emphasize again that the zero surface charge of the metal-PVP catalysts reported here may be an impor- tant factor leading to complete separation of both the colloid particles and the macroheterogeneous cata- lysts from the membrane fraction. Earlier experiments showed that some of the cata- lysts (e.g. the soluble Pd(QS)2) could not be used to study the genetic background of heat shock tolerance of certain organisms because the catalysts themselves triggered similar response than the thermal stress (formation of protective proteins, HSP-s). According to our latest results [38] this is not the case with the PdRh-PVPP catalyst and this opens the way to a deeper understanding of some aspects of most impor- tant processes such as biological acclimation to envir- onmental stress.

Aqueous dispersions of PVP-protected Pd, Pt, Rh, PdPt and PdRh colloids (PVP=poly(2-vinylpyrrolidone)) were successfully applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of water soluble olefins and liposomes as models of biological membranes. The metal-PVP particles were anchored onto the surface of water insoluble, crosslinked poly(2-vinylpyrrolidone), PVPP. Both the sols and the supported catalysts are stable in time, non-permeable to the lipid membrane, and can be separated completely from the reaction mixture by decantation or centrifugation.
