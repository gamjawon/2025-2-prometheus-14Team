The results indicate that about 1096 of the total iron atoms or about 5 atomic layers from the surface are reoxidized during the passivation treatment. This is of the same order as estimated by others from gravimetric, microcalorimetric and Mossbauer studies. Reductions aftdr exposure to oxygen at 20and 100 are comparable, but at 200 and above bulk oxidation sets in. The TPR of a passivated catalyst after five years of operation in the plant is still similar to that of the fresh catalyst after the first reduction and passivation, but the former has apparently only 3 of the iron area of the latter. Keywords: Ammonia synthesis catalyst; Catalyst passivation; Iron catalyst; Passivation layer; TPR 1. Introduction Nowadays ammonia synthesis catalyst is often pre-reduced and passivated by the catalyst manufacturer before it is despatched to the user plants. A relatively mild and quick reduction in the plant reactor is then sufficient to start normal ammonia production with such catalysts. This procedure saves a few days of production, compared to reduction of a fresh catalyst in the plant reactor. Other advantages of off-site pre-reduction and passivation are: specially designed units for reduction (and not for synthesis) and hence better controls; higher gas flowrate and better heating system, custom-designed for a smaller batch of catalyst, *Corresponding author.

Skaugset/Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 295-302 enabling lower water-vapour concentration through the entire catalyst bed; reduction at sufficiently low pressure to prevent uncontrolled temperature rise when some part of the catalyst becomes active for ammonia synthesis; ammonia plants are rarely equipped with systems for careful passivation of catalyst which will be reused. Furthermore, in spite of adequate precautions, in situ reduction in the plant reactor can sometimes result in catalyst layers towards the exit of the reactor having a lower BET surface area than that of the layers at the inlet; this is due to the sintering of the freshly reduced iron in the downstream layers under the influence of the water of reduction from the upstream layers of catalyst [ 1 ] . This partial deactivation of the catalyst, already occurring inadvertently during the very first reduction, can also be avoided by off-site reduction and passivation. The passivation treatment of the otherwise pyrophoric reduced catalyst consists of a very slow and controlled reoxidation to obtain a `skin layer' of iron oxide which can then prevent further oxidation of the reduced iron in the bulk of the catalyst particles. The passivated catalyst can be exposed to air at ambient temperatures and subsequently packed, transported and handled in the normal way [ 1,2 ] . Baranski et al. [ 3-5 ] have conducted several detailed studies on the reduction characteristics of industrial ammonia synthesis catalysts, in particular, on the effects of phase composition, hydrogen pressure and partial pressure of water vapour during reduction. In an earlier study, Baranski et al. [6], using thermogravimetry, have estimated that the `skin layer' of iron oxide formed during passivation is about 3 nm thick. Topsoe et al. [ 7 ] , using M6ssbauer technique, reported a passivation layer thickness of 2 nm for a singly promoted iron catalyst, assuming that half of the iron surface was covered by the potassium promoter. From microcalorimetric studies of oxygen adsorption, Tsarev et al. [ 8 ] report that two forms of oxygen participate in the formation of the passivation layer: the fist one, proceeding up to 7 monolayers and characterized by a high heat of adsorption of 420 kJ/mol, which is close to the heat of iron oxidation, and the second with only 84 kJ/mol is apparently an intermediate form of adsorbed oxygen. Krylova et al. [ 9 ] observe that catalysts passivated at 20 are not sufficiently stable to secondary oxidation. They suggest an optimum passivation temperature of either 100 or a much higher range of 400-500; at the intermediate range of 180-260, \"a thick and loose layer of the oxide mixture is formed and the catalyst cannot be so easily regenerated again\". From kinetics of oxygen adsorption on passivated catalysts, Vasilevich et al. [ 10] propose that further oxidation of passivated catalysts is related to a bulk process involving about 50 oxygen monolayers (calculated from the extent of the reduced iron surface). The degree of iron reoxidation at 50, 100, 150 and 200 is 7.3, 9.6, 18.8 and 31 %, respectively, according to Beskrovnyi et al. [ 11 ] . In the present study, the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) technique was employed (a) to estimate the fraction of total iron atoms on the catalyst which is involved in the passivation treatment, (b) to examine at what temperature bulk oxidation will set in and (c) for a comparison of fresh catalyst with a used one, taken out of a plant reactor after five years of operation. P. G. Menon, P. Skaugset /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 295-302 297 2. Experimental Commercial ammonia synthesis catalyst of the AS4 type of Norsk Hydro was obtained for this study in three states: (a) fresh, (b) pre-reduced + passivated (PR + P) and (c) used + passivated (U + P), discharged from a plant reactor after five years of ammonia synthesis on it. The catalyst samples were crushed to < 0.5 mm size for the TPR studies. Exactly 100 mg of the catalyst were taken between two quartz wool plugs in a quartz U-tube reactor (4 mm I.D. and 6 mm O.D.). Some properties of these catalyst samples are given in Table 1. Scanning electron microscopy, combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of the (PR+P) and (U + P) samples did not reveal any systematic difference between the samples [ 12 ] . This may perhaps be an indication that no major chemical restructuring or redistribution of promoters on the surface has taken place, although these techniques are not surface-sensitive to a few atomic layers. Crushing of the pre-reduced and passivated catalyst may expose some nonpassivated iron surface to air, which may lead to some reoxidation of the catalyst. This problem has not been studied in detail. However, in some check experiments, tens of grams of pre-reduced catalysts were crushed separately in air and in inert atmosphere from 6-10 mm particle size to 0.4-0.63 mm size, as required for activity testing. No significant change was found for either the activity or the measured total (BET) surface area of the samples crushed in air or in inert gas [ 12] . The (PR+P) fresh sample was taken from the commercially produced AS4F catalyst which was passivated in the normal way by slowly increasing the concentration of oxygen in nitrogen in the pre-reduction and passivation plant. The used catalyst was taken at 5.9 m from the top of the bed in a 11 m high bed of a TVA ammonia-synthesis converter; it was taken during emptying the converter (after five years of operation), as active catalyst under nitrogen atmosphere. It was then stored in a sealed steel tank (several litres in volume) for some days. Then the catalyst sample was passivated by circulating nitrogen and adding air very slowly, keeping the temperature below 40. This passivation procedure lasted a few days. The catalyst sample from this steel tank is designated as (U + P). Both the fresh and used samples have been stored for almost ten years in air, the former in a steel drum which has been opened from time to time to take samples and the latter in a Table 1 Characteristics of ammonia synthesis catalysts Type Industrial catalyst, AS4 type of Norsk Hydro Composition Elements present in more than trace concentrations: Al 2.0, K 0.55, Ca 2.2, Mg 0.5, Si 0.1 wt.-%; rest Fe and O Catalyst condition Fresh PR + P U + P BET surface area (M2/g) - 12 8 Pore volume (cm'/g) - 0.1 0.1 298 P.G.

No deterioration of any kind was noticed in the properties or catalytic activity of these samples over the years of storing [ 12] . The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies, the exposure of reduced catalyst to oxygen (5% 02/95% He) at 25, 100, 200, 300, flushing with argon, subsequent TPR, etc., were all carried out on an Altamira AMI-1 automated unit. The gases used were all of 99.999% purity grading and were used without any further purification. The water formed in the reduction is trapped on a molecularsieve column so that it does not interfere with the TCD signal. The sequential pretreatment/exposure/TPR/pulse-calibration experiments could be programmed up to 10 steps (and the unit could be left operating unattended overnight). 3. Results and discussion The TPR profile of the fresh unreduced catalyst is shown in Fig. 1. The reduction starts at about 380 and continues at 600 for several hours; at the low concentration of only 5% H2 in the HZ7Ar mixture used for TPR and its low flow-rate of only 20 ml/min, further reduction was not possible due to the prevailing ratio of the partial pressures of water vapour and hydrogen. Higher flow-rates or higher hydrogen content in the gas for TPR would affect the sensitivity of TPR and make it difficult to compare the results with those for the passivated catalyst samples. Fig. 2 shows the TPR of 100 mg of the pre-reduced + passivated catalyst and the used + passivated sample. The reduction peak maxima for these catalysts are at 474 and 492, respectively. One sample of the pre-reduced + passivated catalyst was exposed to a stream of 5% 02/95% He for 1 h at 25, 100, 200, and 300, with TPR after every exposure to 02/He. This sequence of oxygen-pretreatment/ TPR runs are shown in Fig. 3. The pre-reduced catalyst after exposure to oxygen at 25, 100 or 200 can still be reduced relatively easily and completely.

TPR conditions same as for Fig. 1. to oxygen at 300 involves bulk oxidation; subsequent reduction is incomplete and no longer easy ( Fig. 3 ) . There is an effect of water vapour also on the passivated catalyst: adsorbed water is observed as a weight loss at about 100 when TPR is followed by thermogravimetry [ 7 ] , but not by TCD, where the water is usually trapped on a molecular-sieve column. Krylova et al. [ 9] have proposed that passivation at 100 is better than that at 20. To check whether any evidence for this could perhaps be obtained from TPR, two separate TPR runs were made on two 100 mg PR + P catalyst samples, one pre-treated with 5%OZ/He for 1 h at 25 and the other at 100. TPR runs at a heating rate of 5/min showed a marginally easier reduction after exposure to oxygen at 100 (Fig. 4A). A repetition with two new catalyst samples, but with a heating rate of 2 /min, showed just the opposite effect ( Fig. 4B ) .

[ 13 ] . One corollary from these results, however, could be that the pre-reduced catalyst can withstand a temperature rise up to 100 (for instance, from an accidental air leak before the passivation treatment), whereas temperatures above 200 can cause bulk oxidation to a greater or less extent. On the Altamira unit, pulses (50 Al each) of argon can be sent into the carrier stream of 5% HZ/Ar under identical flow conditions as for the TPR run; the area of the resultant peaks is integrated automatically. An average value per pulse is calculated from 10 identical pulses: This gives a conversion factor to convert TPR peak area values directly into quantity of hydrogen consumed for the TPR. The results of the TPR runs, quantified in this way, are: hydrogen consumed for TPR after exposure of the catalyst to oxygen at 25 (PR+P) =1.83 mmol/g cat.; hydrogen consumed in TPR of used (U + P) catalyst =1.19 mmol/ g. This indicates a decrease (sintering) of the accessible iron surface area of the used catalyst to about two-third of that of the (PR + P) sample. (The well-known covering of a part of the iron surface by the promoter oxides has not been taken into account here). This sintering is also reflected in the BET surface area values: 12 and 8 m2/ g for the PR + P and U + P catalyst samples respectively (Table 1) . X-ray diffrac- P.G. Menon, P. Skaugset /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 295-302 301 tion measurements [ 12] indicate a mean iron-crystallite dimension of 28 nm for this sample of the used catalyst, compared to the normal values of 22-25 nn for a fresh pre-reduced catalyst. This difference here could be attributed to sintering of the iron, but it is not much larger than the usual margin in such measurements. The TPR technique, of course, cannot identify the chemical state of the passivating layer. Nor can it indicate whether the surface exists as FeO, Fe203, or Fe304, or how much of the surface is covered by the promoter-oxide species but the similar peak temperatures for the fresh and used samples may be taken as an indication that the surface species in these two are not very different. The surface area of 1 g Fe at a dispersion of 100% is about 700 m2. Since 1 g Fe contains 107 -102Fe atoms, the effective surface area per iron atom can be calculated to be 6.5 A2. Assuming the reduction step of the catalyst to be Fe0 + H2 -+ Fe + H20, the 1.83 mmol / g of hydrogen consumed in the TPR of the PR+P catalyst corresponds to 10% of the total iron atoms in the catalyst. An independent support for this 10% value is from the water of reduction collected in ammonia synthesis plants: the water collected during the reduction of PR + P catalyst is about one-tenth of that collected during the reduction of the corresponding quantity of fresh catalyst [ 14 ] . From the BET surface area of the PR+P catalyst (12 m2/g) and the value of 700 m2/g for iron at 100% dispersion, the fraction of iron atoms on the surface or the degree of dispersion of this catalyst can be estimated to be 2%. This value and the 10% value, mentioned above, suggest that about five atomic layers of iron from the surface are oxidized in the passivation treatment. The thickness of this passivation layer can then be estimated to be 1.5-2.0 run. This is in fair agreement with the value of about 3 nm, reported by Baranski et al. [ 6 ] from gravimetric measurements, 2 nm estimated by Topsoe et al. [ 7 ] from Mossbauer spectra, and 7 atomic layers proposed by Tsarev et al. [ 8 ] from microcalorimetric studies. The thickness of the passivation layer in the above calculation from TPR may vary by about 25% if other oxides of iron are assumed to be present on the catalyst surface; this is within the accuracy with which the thickness of the passivation layer from the various techniques above is compared. Using ultra-high vacuum and molecular beam techniques, the nature of the potassium promoter species in the (PR + P) and (U + P) catalyst species has been studied by Engvall et al. [ 15 ] at Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden. The emission of potassium as atoms, ions or excited species (the so-called Rydberg states) from the catalysts at typical process temperatures of 500 and above has been studied. Their separate concentrations, angular distributions, and activation energies for desorption could be determined from such measurements. Such studies by Holmlid and coworkers [ 16,17] are in progress. 4. Conclusions 1. The pre-reduced + passivated ammonia synthesis catalyst can be reduced rather easily; it requires about 1.8 mmol H2/g catalyst, corresponding to roughly 10% of the total iron atoms in the catalyst. 302 P.G. Menon, P. Skaugset/Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 295-302 2. Exposure of the pre-reduced catalyst to oxygen up to 100 does not involve bulk oxidation of iron to any appreciable extent. 3. The used catalyst has only 3 of the iron area of the unused catalyst. 4. In spite of its well-known limitations, TPR can be used as a sensitive finger- print for routine characterization of the passivated ammonia synthesis catalyst in its pre-reduced and used states.

        "dc:description": "Industrial ammonia synthesis catalyst, in its fresh, reduced + passivated and used + passivated conditions, was studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The results indicate that about 10% of the total iron atoms or about 5 atomic layers from the surface are reoxidized during the passivation treatment. This is of the same order as estimated by others from gravimetric, microcalorimetric and Mössbauer studies. Reductions after exposure to oxygen at 20° and 100°C are comparable, but at 200°C and above bulk oxidation sets in. The TPR of a passivated catalyst after five years of operation in the plant is still similar to that of the fresh catalyst after the first reduction and passivation, but the former has apparently only2/3 of the iron area of the latter.",
