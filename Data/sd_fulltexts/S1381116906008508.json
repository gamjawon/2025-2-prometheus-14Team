Graphical abstract The structure–selectivity relationship of the intramolecular enyne metathesis of 3 catalyzed by various ruthenium carbenes was investigated. This study witnesses the very subtle and cooperative influence of different parameters on the stereochemical course of this reaction. We have investigated the selectivity of the intramolecular enyne metathesis catalyzed by representative first- and second-generation ruthenium carbenes. This study witnesses the very subtle and cooperative influence of different parameters on the stereochemical course of this reaction. In the case of enynes containing an internal triple bond and a monosubstituted double bond only the application of first-generation catalysts leads selectively to the formation of the expected product. If the substrate bears an internal triple bond and a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment first-generation catalysts are inert in this cyclization, while in the case of more reactive second-generation catalysts the transformation proceeds with high conversion, but is not selective. Only when a substrate contains a less accessible (e.g. sterically hindered) triple bond the application of second-generation catalysts can ensure a high level of selectivity. Keywords Enyne metathesis Ruthenium Catalysis Selectivity 1 Introduction Enyne metathesis has become an important synthetic method. Recent reviews have described the synthetic utility and mechanistic aspects of this reaction in detail [1–3]. The metathesis between an alkyne and an alkene provides a conjugated 1,3-diene (Scheme 1 ). Like its sister transformation olefin metathesis, enyne metathesis has seen many applications in organic synthesis and is increasingly used in total synthesis of complicated bioactive or natural products [4]. This is due to the discovery of well-defined alkylidene-metal catalysts of which the ruthenium carbenes bearing types 1, 2 and 2′ ligands offer a good compromise between efficiency and tolerance toward functional groups (Scheme 2 ) [5]. 2 Discussion In the course of our investigation on the reactivity profile of new Hoveyda type catalysts N1 and N2 [9], we observed that the use of second-generation complexes H2, N2 and A2 in enyne metathesis led in some cases to the formation of an undesired product and, thereby resulting in a low selectivity for this process. Interestingly, the first-generation congener N1 exhibited a high level of selectivity in this transformation, leading to the formation of a single product [9]. Recently, Mori and co-workers have shown that metathesis of enynes containing an internal triple bond and a 1,1-disubstituted alkene unit proceed in a nonselective manner, leading to the formation of three products: an expected five-membered ring product 4, a six-membered ring product 5 and a bicyclic product 6, containing a cyclopropane unit (Scheme 3 , X≠H) [10a,b]. However, when a substrate having a monosubstituted alkene (X=H) was treated with G1 in a similar manner, the cyclized product 4 was obtained selectively in high yield [10c]. We decided to investigate in detail the respective influences of substrate's and catalyst's nature on the course of this transformation [11]. To do so, we were led to synthesize a range of enynes bearing different substitutents in hope to observe possible regularities. Our exploratory study (Scheme 4 ; Table 1 ) starts from a simple substrate bearing an internal C–C triple bond and a monosubstituted alkene fragment (3a). In reactions catalyzed by second-generation carbenes (both Grubbs’ and Hoveyda's type) an inseparable mixture of 4a, 5a and 6a was formed (Table 1, entry 1). The ratio of products was calculated from GC–MS and NMR spectra, while the products were identified by means of NMR and GC–MS spectra analysis and comparison with authentic samples, where available. Interestingly, first-generation catalysts give only one product, 4a. Similar results were obtained in the case of other substrates containing an internal alkyne motif (3b, 3c, 3d, 3e and 3f). In all cases the use of first-generation ruthenium catalysts led to selective formation of only one product (4), while second-generation complexes were in general less selective. It should be noted that in the case of 3c, a cyclopropane derivative of type 6 was not formed, whereas in the case of 3f, we did not observe a six-membered product 5f. After analyzing the data compiled in Table 1 one can arrange the catalysts in the following order of increasing selectivity: Encouraged by these results, we decided to undertake a similar investigation of “Mori's type” enynes bearing an internal alkyne and a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment [10a,b]. In the case of enyne 3g, two products 4g and 5g were formed in almost equal amounts (together with 1–5% of 6g) using second-generation catalysts. In line with previous observation [10a], in the case of first-generation catalyst the reaction did not proceed at all (Table 1, entry 7). Analysis of the conversion and selectivity rates yielded some interesting findings. Based on these results, we tried to explain the respective roles of the catalyst and substitution pattern of the enyne substrate on the course of this reaction. In general, two major pathways can be proposed for those substrates: “ene-then-yne”, features cases where the cycloaddition to a double bond occurs first, and “yne-then-ene”, those where prior addition to a triple bond takes place [10–12]. Perfect selectivity of first-generation catalysts may indicate that in this case the reaction proceeds according to path A, namely via cycloaddition of a ruthenium–carbene to the double bond followed by [2+2] cycloaddition to the triple bond, to form the sole five-membered ring product (Scheme 4). Path B is not possible due to formation of a highly strained bicyclic intermediate during the initial cycloaddition step (Scheme 4). Since dissociation of the phosphane ligand in G1, leading to the formation of catalytically active 14-electron species, occurs faster than dissociation of the chelating isopropoxy fragment in Hoveyda's complexes, therefore Grubbs I catalyst G1 initiates faster than Hoveyda's I-generation complexes [6,13]. On the other hand, it is known that 1,1-disubstituted alkenes do not react with first-generation metathesis catalysts [14], and for this reason the reaction of substrate 3g, where X=CH3 catalyzed by carbenes G1, A1, H1 and N1, does not proceed. Formation of 4g and 5g in equal amounts in the presence of 1a–d means that this reaction runs through paths C and D via addition to the triple bond (Table 1, entry 7). Also in other reactions of this type tested by us, second-generation catalysts gave usually mixtures of two major products 4 and 5. It means that, in that case, the reaction proceeded through pathways C and D. One exception is the reaction of 3f, where product 5f was not formed, even when the less selective second-generation catalyst N2 was used. We presume that, in this case, the steric hindrance of two phenyl groups prohibits the interaction between the ruthenium carbene and the triple bond. Products of type 6 are known to be formed in the path C via reductive elimination from metalacyclobutane derivative [10] or through “enyne bond reorganization” [15] and we, indeed, observed such products in many reactions catalyzed by second-generation complexes. NHC ligands 2 and 2′ are better σ-donors as compared to PCy3 and, as a result, NHC–ruthenium carbenes feature lower energetic barriers in cycloaddition–insertion reactions [12]. While this should not be over-interpreted, this would seem to indicate that [2+2] cycloaddition to the triple bond (paths C and D) which can give a six-membered ring product 5 and a cyclopropane derivative 6 (Scheme 5 ) is favorable in the case of second-generation catalysts. Nevertheless, the path A is still operative, with 4 being formed as a major reaction product in most cases. Since the kinetically controlled cycloaddition to the triple bond is determining the regioselectivity of the whole process, the most active catalyst N2 shows the lowest selectivity. In order to further confirm our hypothesis, we studied cascade enyne-RCM transformations of type 7 substrates (Scheme 6 ; Table 2 ). As expected, only one product, 10a, was formed using catalysts G1 and N1. Product 8a (9a) was not observed because it readily cyclizes to 10a under the reaction conditions. Product 11a (12a) is formed in the presence of second-generation catalysts via path D and further does not transform to condensed bicyclic product, perhaps, due to strain nature of 13. Products 10a and 11a (12a) differ by polarities and it was possible to separate them by column chromatography. In the case of 7b, explaining the observed selectivity control becomes more complicated. With catalysts G1 and N1 dihydrofurane 8b was obtained as a main product together with a small amount of 10b. One can assume that at first a new ruthenium–carbene was produced on the easiest accessible monosubstituted double bond (C-1, for relative numbering of atoms refer to Scheme 6), whereas cycloaddition to the triple bond (C-3,4) proceeded with further opening of a metalacyclobutene ring to give a next metal–carbene which can hardly react with 1,1-disubstituted alkene part (C-2). This can explain why first-generation complexes G1 and N1 give mostly product 8b. When the more reactive NHC-containing catalysts G2 and N2 are used, metal–carbenes formed from a triple bond (C-3/4) can more effectively react with a substituted C–C double bond to give 10b. In that case, however, the initial cycloaddition step to a triple bond is also possible, leading to the formation of a six-membered heterocycle 11b as the sole product. The preference for the formation of 11b over 12b corroborates the assumption that the ruthenium–carbene formed at C-4 reacts more readily with a double bond (C-1) than the ruthenium–carbene at C-3 reacting with alkene part (C-2), respectively. (In that case, it reacts with C-1 affording 10b through intermediate 8b.) In the case of 7c only 10c is produced due to sterical hindrance of a triple bond that makes impossible approaching of ruthenium carbene to the alkyne part (C-3/4). Products 8c and 9c do not form since the intermediate ruthenium–carbene (formed at C-3/4) easily inserts into the double bond (C-1 and C-2) affording 10c irrespectively of the catalyst used. Similarly, in the case of 7d the reaction also proceeds via path A. Second-generation catalysts G2 and N2 give only one product, 10d, while less active first-generation analogues are practically inert in this transformation. 3 Conclusion In conclusion, we have investigated the selectivity of the intramolecular enyne metathesis catalyzed by representative first- and second-generation ruthenium carbenes [16]. This study witnesses the very subtle and cooperative influence of different parameters on the regiochemical course of this reaction. In the case of enynes containing an internal triple bond and a monosubstituted double bond only the application of first-generation catalysts leads selectively to the formation of the expected product 4. If the substrate bears an internal triple bond and a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment first-generation catalysts are inert in this cyclization, while in the case of more reactive second-generation catalysts the transformation proceeds with high conversion, but is not selective. Only when a substrate contains a less accessible (e.g. sterically hindered) triple bond the application of second-generation catalysts can ensure a high level of selectivity. 4 Experimental 4.1 General procedure for enyne metathesis A Schlenck flask was charged with 4-(allyloxy)-2-butynyl acetate (3d) (42mg, 0.25mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3ml). To a stirred solution of substrate was successively added a solution of catalyst (N1) (4mg, 0.006mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1ml) and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature until TLC showed complete conversion of the substrate (1h). The solvent was evaporated in vacuum and the residue was purified by flash chromatography with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (9/1) as the eluent, thus providing product 4d as a colorless oil (39mg, 94%). 4.2 Analysis data N-Allyl-N-(2-butynyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (colorless oil) (3a). 1H NMR (200MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.74 (d, J =8.4Hz, 2H), 7.29 (d, J =8.4Hz, 2H), 5.82–5.63 (m, 1H), 5.32–5.15 (m, 2H), 4.05–3.97 (m, 2H), 3.79 (d, J =6.4Hz, 2H), 2.42 (s, 3H), 1.55–1.52 (m, 3H).

        "dc:description": "We have investigated the selectivity of the intramolecular enyne metathesis catalyzed by representative first- and second-generation ruthenium carbenes. This study witnesses the very subtle and cooperative influence of different parameters on the stereochemical course of this reaction. In the case of enynes containing an internal triple bond and a monosubstituted double bond only the application of first-generation catalysts leads selectively to the formation of the expected product. If the substrate bears an internal triple bond and a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment first-generation catalysts are inert in this cyclization, while in the case of more reactive second-generation catalysts the transformation proceeds with high conversion, but is not selective. Only when a substrate contains a less accessible (e.g. sterically hindered) triple bond the application of second-generation catalysts can ensure a high level of selectivity.",
