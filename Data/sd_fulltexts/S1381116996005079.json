Zakharov * , AX Startsev, G.M. Zhidomirov Boreskou Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia Received 21 September 1996: accepted 8 October 1996 Abstract The role of the electronic state of the Ni atoms in the sulfide catalysts is studied by means of ab initio molecular orbital calculations. It is shown that the Ni ion with d8 electron configuration in the square-planar sulfur surrounding is not active in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. The d8-state can be transformed to the d6-state after adsorption of the H , S molecule and formation of the square-pyramidal surrounding for the nickel ion. A square-pyramidal structure of the HZS adsorption complex on Ni/MoS2 catalysts with Ni(db) is calculated as the active center. The HDS catalytic cycle, for which the HS adsorption complex is the initial and final state, is proposed.

Introduction Nickel- or cobalt-promoted molybdenum sulfide catalysts are extensively studied in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. Especially the role and the chemical (electronic) state of the cobalt and nickel atoms in the sulfide catalysts is a subject of numerous experimental [1-3] and theoretical [4-6] investigations. Various models for the structure of an active center (AC) of the catalyst have been proposed [1-3], but at the present the models based on the MOS2 single slabs with Ni(Co) atoms localized in its edge plane have received the best recognition. Nevertheless, even if the similarity of the active com- Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science BA'. All rights reserved. PHS1381-1169(96)00507-9 portent and MOS2 structure does not cause any doubt, there is no unified opinion on the Ni(Co)-localization. There exist at least two points of view: a square-planar surrounding of Ni(Co) atoms with S atoms at the (1010) plane of a MoS2(WSZ) single slab [7] and a squarepyramidal surrounding of Ni(Co) with five S atoms at the edge plane of a MoS2 single slab [8,9]. But as was shown in [3], there is no contradiction between these models: the square-planar surrounding transforms into a square-pyramidal one after adsorption of a donor molecule (Fig. 1), which was confirmed experimentally [10]. This situation is typical of pentacoordinated metal complexes. Coordination of the corresponding donor molecule to the metal in a square-planar surrounding leads to the forma- 438 LL Zakharou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 437-447 Ni S2 S3 S1 S4 Mote Moo S9 $7 S5 g1o S8 Ss Ss Mo Mo S7 i S2 S3 goo Ni Sl S4 Fig. 1. Side and top view of a square-pyramidal Ni/MOS2 active component (NiMo2SIo-fragment). tion of complex in which the metal is localized in a square-pyramidal environment [ 11,12]. The electronic state of Ni in the composition of the active component of sulfide HDS catalysts seems to be the key problem for understanding the mechanism of HDS catalysis. To our knowledge this question has not been considered in the literature thus far. We have performed ab initio calculations of Ni(SZC2H2)2 as a molecular model of AC in HDS catalysts. It was shown that in the square-planar coordination Ni has a d8 electron configuration corresponding to the formal oxidation state MOO [13]. In this state Ni is not active for adsorption of donor molecule as H Z S [ 14]. Accounting for the tendency of the Ni(S 2C Z H 2) 2 complex (NiBDT) to form stable dimer structures with a Ni atom transferred from a plane of the complex, one can assume Ni C S I S C S S C Fig. 2. Calculated adduct of HZS molecule with chelate complex Ni(S2CZH2)2. [15] that there are structures for which the unusual oxidation state of Ni(W) with electron configuration db can occur. Our calculations of the HZS:NiBDT molecular adduct confirm such an assumption (Fig. 2). Two lone pairs n, and n,, of the H Z S molecule interact efficiently with two vacant d, and d,, orbitals of Ni(IV) with the electron configuration d6 [14]. The possibility of NOV) existence in the Ni/MoS2 system may be proposed basing on the XPS data [3,16,17] giving an excess of positive charge on Ni in Ni/MoS2 compared to NiS. The NOV) oxidation state (d b electron configuration) is well known in the cases of octahedral fluoro (NiF6)-2 and dithiocarbamate [Ni(R2dtc)3]+ complexes [18]. In this paper the ab initio calculations have been carried out for the NiMo2 S to cluster on the geometry suggested by Bouwens et al. [8,9]. 1.1. Zakharou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 437-447 For all atoms of the cluster the charges were given according to their formal oxidation state (+ 2, + 4 and - 2 for Ni, Mo and S respectively; the possible reduction of Mo by Ni has been also taken into account [4]). We focus our attention on elucidating the electronic and energetic effects for the interaction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) with the active component MMo2 S lo. 2. Method and calculation details All calculations were carried out with use of the LANLl effective core potential for inner shells of Ni, Mo and S atoms [19] and basis set single-~ (MB) or double-~ (DZ) for valence shells provided with the Gaussian 92 package [20]. The electronic correlation was taken into account using the Mler-Plesset perturbation theory at the second order (MP2) [21]. Geometry-optimized calculations for the H 2 S molecule and its adsorption complex were carried out at the MP2 level with the split-valence 3-21G basis set for H atoms and LANLIDZ for the S atom. The cluster model for ab initio calculations of the active component N'MoZSlo has been used. At this point, we must mention a typical problem that arises when performing cluster calculations, namely, the dangling bonds and charged species.

The basis set STO-3G with scale factor= 1.3 for H-`terminal' atoms, the LANLIDZ for Ni atom and the LANLIMB for S atoms were used for calculations of the clusters M02SIOH12 and NiMo2SloHIo.

Electronic structure of the N'Mo2Slo11lo cluster with dg electron configuration of Ni(II) It is well known that the addition of Ni(Co) to MoS2(WS2) can give rise to an enhancement of HDS activity. The effect of the Ni(Co)-promotion as an electronic (chemical) one has been supported by Harris and Chianelli [4]. This work [4] suggests that the synergetic systems behave at their surface as if they are hypothetical `pseudo-binary' sulfides having average properties of their two components. Our (A.N.S.) study of the sulfide catalysts by modern physicochemical methods resulted in a model of the active component structure which received the name `sulfide bimetallic species' - SBMS [3]. Considering the electronic structure of the cluster NiMo2S10H10 as such SBMS model one can note that the calculated charge on Mo (Table 2) is smaller than for the unpromoted MOS2 (Table 1). This is consistent with the SCF-X a calculation result for the Co-Mo and Ni-Mo binary sulfides [4], that Mo is formally reduced relative to the Mo4+ presented in MOS2. Most of the authors [1,2,4] claim that the increasing catalytic HDS activity is purely a promotion effect, while by our opinion [3], the promoter atoms are the catalysts themselves. The idea that Ni(Co) in sulfided Ni-Mo and Co-Mo catalysts is the actual catalyst rather than the promoter originates from Refs. [23-26]. That is the reason of our attention to calculation of the detail electronic structure of Ni in N'Mo 2 S 10 H 10. For the lowest energy state of N'Mo2S1oH10, the electronic structure of Ni with formally empty dX`, level (in the coordinate system of Fig. 3) is obtained (Table 2). The calculated dX,, orbital population has 1.1 electrons due to coordinate-covalent bonding with the four S1-S4 atoms in the cluster. Such d-orbital energy level scheme looks like the square planar transitionmetal complexes with one (d,y) above four d-obitals, though in our case, the Ni atom is transferred from the plane of Sl-S4 atoms by 0.48 (square-pyramidal coordination). The Ni basis d-functions are split into different representations in the C2v point group of the cluster NiMo2S101-110: dZ2(al), dxZ(bl), dvZ(b2)~ dX2_v2(al) and dxy(a2). Calculations were performed for all the closed-shell d''-configurations obtained from distributing the eight nickel 3d electrons among the five d-orbitals. This gives five various lA 1 states for the cluster. The calculated atomic population of the d-orbitals of Ni in these states and the charge distribution of the cluster are summarized in Table 2. First of all we note that the cluster electronic states with the nickel dZ2- and dXZ empty orbitals are lowenergy excite states, because these d-orbitals Table 2 Calculated dN electron configurations of divalent nickel ion (ds) for square-pyramidal active site in the cluster N'Mo2SIOH1o dN electron Calculated d-orbital Calculated net charges MP2 energy configuration a electron population b Ni Mo S1-S' SS-S6 S7-S1o for cluster (a.u.) for Ni ion dgd, ds9o`,zdxdz.ood2Pods.Vo +0.45 +0.54 -0.32 -0.29 -0.46 -159.24489 dsd d2.oodz.oods.o 9S,zdo.?s-0.54 +0.54 -0.36 -0.25 -0.44 -159.14497 d8d d?,P2dxdl,99d2.9o`,zd8o +0.65 +0.57 -0.36 -0.31 -0.44 -159.12174 d8 d, d?.Pxdx'd;91 VA1Z +0.89 +0.51 -0.43 -0.28 -0.44 -159.07642 dedo.z_,.z dx0sd2'b2dZ;d'~33d;'911~,z +0.82 +0.51 -0.45 -0.32 -0.38 -159.03423 Length for the `terminal' S-H-bond in the cluster re = 1.41 The Ni-Mo bond length (2.80 is taken from [8,9]. a Occupation number of nickel d orbitals in the one-determinant wavefunction used as initial approximation for the SCF calculations. b Mulliken population analysis was performed on the MP2 wavefunction. ` The sequence of the d orbitals corresponds to that calculated for the d-splitting levels. l. l.

Structure of adsorbed HZS complex on O-Ni N'MoZSIOHIo For studying the adsorption of H 2 S on the cluster NiMo2StoH,O, we have earned out calculations of electronic properties separately for the cluster (Table 2), for the free molecule HZS and for the composite H2S-NiMo2SloHto system (Fig. 4). Geometry-optimized calculations at the MP2 level for the H z S molecule and its adsorbed complex are shown in Table 3. From the analysis of the calculated data (Tables 2 and 3) the following features are worth to mention: (i) According to the total MP2 energy values, the dHd,-state of Ni in the cluster represents the most stable adsorbed complex of 142S. The corresponding MP2 energy value for the isolated NiMo2SloHlo cluster with the same dsdtx1,-state of Ni (Table 2) and MP2 energy for the free molecule H 2 S (Table 3) give minor bonding interaction ( Eads = 36 kJ/mol). The interaction HZS-NiMo2SloHlO produces very small changes of the electronic structures of the participants. The small value of the adsorption energy, 36 kJ/mol, also shows that the interaction with H2S has a polarizative (no-covalent) nature. This is in accordance with the result 441 nn n Ni -o / /mo /_ Mo o- Ht Fig. 4.

(ii) Analysis of the structure of the HZS adsorption complex with dgd=- and dgd,.~- zstates of Ni shows that the bonding interaction is stronger than in case (i). The symmetry of the nickel d_2 and dx=_V2 basis functions corresponds to the same a l irreducible representation in the C 2v point group.

Both of these states of the H 2 S adsorption complex are excite-energy states and will be unstable in real surface phenomena. 5. Electronic structure of the clusters with d6 electron configuration of Ni(IV) The common chemistry of nickel is the chemistry of the + 2 oxidation state, although its known chemistry spans all oxidation states from -1 to + 4 [ 17]. The nickel(II) ion has a d8 electron configuration and, with weak-field ligands such as H 20, it forms a six-coordinated ion with octahedral symmetry and a paramagnetic (t6gegeg) ground state. The splitting of the d orbitals shows two do. above three d,, orbitals. The thermodynamic stability of the sixcoordinate complexes generally increases as the ligand-field strength increases. A strong square-planar ligand field results in formation of the diamagnetic ground state with one (dXy) above four d orbitals. Nickel(IV) chemistry is commencing some 90 years after the synthesis of the heteropoly(molybdate) [NiMo9032 ]6complex [27]. In the case of nickel in a high oxidation state, it is imperative that the ligands should have more negative charges. In other words, the number of ligands and its electronegativity should be high. In this way the model of pseudooctahedral-coordinated NOV) with a d6 electron configuration can be understood.

Facile loss of eg electrons can then give NOV) species (Fig. 5). Actually, nickel(IV) complexes are diamagnetic and have a strong preference for an octahedral geometry [28,29] with IODq = 20000 cm-' [30] greater than for Ni(II) (10Dq 7250 cm-' [31]), for NiF-and NiF-, respectively. The + IV oxidation state for the nickel triad elements (Ni, Pd, Pt) provides a firmer basis for proposals involving this species in catalysis [32]. In the case of HDS reaction, Ni(IV) cation formation is expected to enhance the nucleophilic attack for such donor molecules as hydrogen sulfide, thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene. On the other hand, an electron-deficient metal atom on the surface should have a very high resistance to sulfur poisoning. As is shown in [33], the rate of deactivation of a Pd/A1203 catalyst by thiophene during ethylbenzene hydrogenation decreases as the concentration of Pds+ increases [34].

First of all, computed MP2 total energies for the cluster and the adsorption complex with Ni(IV), d6dd electron configuration are lower than for divalent Ni(II), dgdy (0 E, = 5.9 eV and 0 E2 = 6.4 eV, respectively, see Tables 2-4). The adsorption energy of the H 2 S molecule for Ni(IV), d6-state (Ends = 82.6 kJ/mol) is greater than for MOO, dg-state (Eads = 36.0 kJ/mol). The calculated equilibrium bond distances Ni-SH2 are 2.60 A and 2.77 A for Ni(IV) and Ni(II), respectively. From this, the adsorption energy appears to increase with increases in the formal oxidation state of Ni in the cluster. Because the stabilization energy of the d6-state for the H2S adsorption complex (0 E2 = 6.4 eV) is greater than for the free cluster (D El = 5.9 eV), we can conclude that the d6-state of the Ni(IV) ion is stabilized during adsorption. The relatively strong interaction between the H 2 S and the NOV) ion can be understood in terms of orbital overlap (see Scheme 1). Two lone pairs na and n, of the H 2 S molecule interact efficiently with two vacant da( z`) and d,,(xz) orbitals of Ni(IV), d6 electron configuration. It is interesting to note that there is a difference in such interaction between the Ni(IV) ion and metallic 443 H / H nn n 6 Ni(IV) 3dxz 3dz2 Scheme 1.

The latter results in the `tilted' geometry of H 2 S adsorbed with competition between o- and 7r-lone pairs for the maximum bonding to the surface [35]. The charge transfer from H 2 S to the cluster NiMo 2 S to H to due to adsorption and the charge transformation of cluster due to the MOO --> NOV) transition are demonstrated in Table 5. Changes in the values of the charge of S'-S4 atoms in the cluster are the most dramatical due to Ni(IV) formation. Increase in the formal charge of nickel (Ni2+- Ni4+) in the cluster has brought about twice changes in the calculated charge on the Ni atom (Table 5). The second point to consider is the change in the Mo oxidation state.

Six-coordinated Mo4+ ions are in the trigonal sulfur prism of the MoS2 unit cell (`bulk-like' position) (Fig. 6a). The IR study of the adsorption of NO on Ni-Mo catalyst by Topsoe and Topsoe [36] indicated that the edge Mo atoms are screened and cannot be directly responsible for the catalysis. As Fig. 6b demonstrates, the Ni2+ ion is attached to the square face of a trigonal sulfur prism, but to obtain electrical neutrality two of six ligands should be SH- groups (in place of S2- ). As shown in [8,9], the Ni(Co) atoms at the edges of a single slab of MoS2 have a distorted 5- to 6-fold sulfur coordination (Ni-S coordination number is equal to 5.3). This can be related to our result on stabilization of NOV) ions at the edges of MoS2. A square-pyramidal structure of the H Z S adsorption complex on Ni/MoSz catalyst with NOV), db can be proposed as the active center in the HDS process (Fig. 6c). From a purely chemical point of view, when the sulfur atom is removed as H Z S from MoS 2 molybdenum reduction must be expected [37]. The change of the Mo oxidation state (reduction) must occur due to nickel oxidation also (Ni2+- Ni4+) (see Fig. 6, reaction b --+ c.) Nevertheless, our results do not confirm these expectations, as can be seen comparing Tables 1 and 5. The calculated MP2 values of charges on Mo atoms in MoS2 ( q = + 0.73) and in Ni/MoS2 ( q = + 0.60) indicate, that the significant reduction of Mo does not occur. The main changes in calculated charges are realized on St-S4 and Ni atoms of the surface cluster (Table 5). The oxidation of nickel (Ni2+ - Ni4+) results in significant changes of the charges on Ni atom ( + 0.45 +0.98). These are in accordance with the XPS data [15]: (i) The Mo 3d line in XP-spectra of the sulfide Mo/z03 catalysts is characterized by well-resolved doublets with BE Mo 3d5/2 = 229.0 + 0.2 eV, which corresponds to bulk MoS2, and does not change in bimetallic sulfide [Ni(Co)-Mo1/A1203 catalysts. (ii) The S 2p line in all the catalysts studied exhibits a broad maximum with BE = 162.0 + 0.3 eV. No regularities in its position is found for the mono- and bimetallic sulfide catalysts. (iii) The Ni 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 lines in the sulfide [Ni(Co)-Mo] catalysts are shifted towards high values of BE's by 1.0 (0.5) eV correspondingly in comparison with the sulfide Ni(Co)/203 catalysts. A possible explanation in increase of the Ni oxidation state in the process of the catalyst sulfurization under hydrogen atmosphere seems to be as follows. Formally, reaction b -j c presented in Fig. 6, should be considered as reduc- LL Zakharoo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 437-447 tive elimination, but we believe that under the catalysts preparation conditions the reaction of the oxidative addition of the hydrogen molecule occurs. This reaction of oxidative addition of H 2 to the square-planar Ir(I) complex was discovered over 30 years ago [40] and nowadays it is one of the key reactions in homogeneous catalysis by the VIII group metal complexes [41,42]. As was underlined in [41], the squareplanar complexes with ds electron configuration have a strong tendency to the oxidative hydrogen addition resulted in the transition metal atom with db electron configuration. As also well known, this reaction is the first step of the active center formation in the Wilkinson olefin hydrogenation catalysts [43]. Besides, r1-H 2 transition metal complexes are synthesized [44] and well characterized [45] and now they are considered as precursors into the oxidative addition reactions. Molecular hydrogen complexes represent a relatively new but rapidly expanding area of transition metal chemistry [46,47]. Based on these investigations we believe that the high oxidation state of Ni into the active centers of the HDS catalysts resulted from the oxidative addition of HZ under conditions of catalyst preparations. This problem is a subject of our current investigation. 6. Catalytic cycle and concerted mechanism of thiophene hydrogenolysis Fig. 7 shows a proposed catalytic cycle for HDS of thiophene over Ni(IV)/MOS2 structure. The thiophene hydrogenolysis reaction occurs on SBMS of any composition with low activation energy (30-60 kJ/mol) and high selectivity. The reaction involves 1 molecule of thiophene and 3 (or 4) molecules of hydrogen without appearance of the intermediate products in a gas phase. The following mechanism may be proposed [3]: Adsorption of a thiophene molecule is performed on an active Ni(db) site replacing a H Z S molecule.

Proposal for thiophene HDS catalytic cycle over Ni(IV)/MoS,. confirm the essential reversibility of H 2 S adsorption in the reaction conditions and the possibility of adsorbed H2S being supplanted by thiophene. Hydrogenation of the thiophene molecule results in the destruction of the 7r-system of the aromatic ring and an additional lone pair appears on the S atom of the tetrahydrothiophene (THT). Because THT is more basic than thiophene, it does not desorb into the gas phase. The calculated [38] heat of adsorption in the series H2S < thiophene < THT correlates with present concept. Electron density from the S atom of THT is transferred to catalysts and localized on the its terminal S atoms, which is a driving force for the dissociative adsorption of dihydrogen. Thereupon activated hydrogen is transferred to the adsorbed THT molecule and the process is accomplished with C-S bond scission and butene desorption into the gas phase (Fig. 7). We would like to stress, that the H2S adsorbed complex is regarded as the initial and final step in the HDS mechanism. So, the proposed mechanism does not contradict to the one suggested previously [3], but makes it more detailed. Recently the catalytic cycle for HDS of thiophene over Co-Mo catalysts was pro- 446 LL Zakharou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 437-447 posed [39], where the Co atom is an active center for C-S bond homolysis. 7. Conclusions On the basis of the calculations presented here, we consider that the Ni(dg) ion in the square-planar sulfur surrounding, which can be realized in real catalysts [7], is not active in the HDS process, but the d8-state can transform to the d6-state in the square-pyramidal surrounding of Ni. After adsorption of the H Z S molecule, its two no. and n,,, lone pairs efficiently interact with two vacant dand d,,-orbitals of Ni(d6) and stabilize the active state of the sulfide bimetallic species (SBMS) - the active component of the HDS catalysts. Therefore, we believe that this H 2 S adsorption complex is the initial and final step of the catalytic cycle. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to IN.

The role of the electronic state of the Ni atoms in the sulfide catalysts is studied by means of ab initio molecular orbital calculations. It is shown that the Ni ion with d8 electron configuration in the square-planar sulfur surrounding is not active in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. The d8-state can be transformed to the d6-state after adsorption of the H2S molecule and formation of the square-pyramidal surrounding for the nickel ion. A square-pyramidal structure of the H2S adsorption complex on Ni MoS2 catalysts with Ni(d6) is calculated as the active center. The HDS catalytic cycle, for which the H2S adsorption complex is the initial and final state, is proposed.
