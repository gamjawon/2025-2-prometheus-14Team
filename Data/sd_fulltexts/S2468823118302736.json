Graphical abstract Core-shell type Co0.24Ba (CS) catalyst was prepared by adsorption-deposition method, in which cobalt oxide with small amount of Ba incorporation mainly exists in the porous shell over the BaCO3 support core. This structure of the catalyst not only endues the active component Co a high accessibility to the reactant, but also made the active component promoted by barium better. Due the special structure, the catalyst is much more active in N2O decomposition compared with the catalysts with traditional structure. Over the Co0.24Ba (CS) catalyst that containing only 8.91 wt.% of Co3O4, N2O in feed gas 2000 ppmv N2O/Ar with 20,000 h-1 was 100% decomposed at 400 °C. Keywords Core-shell Co3O4 BaCO3 N2O decomposition 1 Introduction Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most potent anthropogenic green house gasses with high global warming potential [1,2] and the largest stratospheric-ozone-depleting substance [3–4,5]. Therefore, extensive efforts have been invested to evolve an efficient technology for N2O removal from industrial exhaust gases. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging task for environmental engineering to develop a suitable catalyst for low temperature N2O decomposition [6]. For the N2O decomposition, transition metal oxides (M x O y ) based catalysts have attracted considerable attention of the researchers due to their superior activity at low temperature [3,7–17] and the following reaction mechanism has been widely accepted by researchers. The decomposition of N2O molecules is initiated by collision on some oxygen vacancies of the M x O y surface, where the molecules lose their oxygen atoms and thereby become N2 [12,14]. The subsequent step is the oxygen vacancies regeneration by O2 desorption from the MxOy surface, which controls the total reaction rate [8-0911]. Alkali metals and alkaline earth metals additives effectively weaken the M-O bond, and promote surface oxygen desorption, and thereby accelerate the surface oxygen vacancies regeneration [15,16]. Although Ba-induced modification is not comparable to that of the alkali metals for enhancing the activity of M x O y [8], some Ba-doped M x O y catalysts exhibited higher activity under the impurity gases, e.g. O2, H2O, and NOx coexisting reaction conditions [10]. In many transition metal oxide catalysts, the Co-based catalysts were more noticeable for catalyzing the reaction [8,9,15–17]. However, the industrial application of the catalysts has been limited in some extent, as the price of cobalt compounds is considerably higher than that of other transition metals compounds. Clearly, effective utilization of cobalt component in the catalysis is a way to resolve the problem. To seek effective utilization of the cobalt for catalyzing the reaction, a core-shell type of Co3O4/BaCO3 catalyst with a cobalt-rich porous shell was investigated in this paper. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation The raw material BaCO3 and Co(NO3)2·6H2O purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd were directly used for the catalyst preparation without treatment. Due to the large deference of CoCO3 (1.4 × 10-13) and BaCO3 (2.58 × 10-9) in solubility product, the reaction (1) BaC O 3 s + C o 2 + aq . → CoC O 3 s + B a 2 + aq . Occurs on the BaCO3 surface in Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution. Base on this principle, core-shell type of Co x Ba(CS) catalysts were prepared by adsorption-deposition method, where x represents the atomic ratio of Co to Ba in the catalysts. According to the x to be obtained, the following two different methods (a or b) were selected for preparing the catalysts (Table 1 ): a. The catalysts with the Co/Ba ratio x ≤ 0.03 were prepared in the following procedures. 1 g BaCO3 powder was added to 6 mL of 0.1 mol/L Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution at room temperature and shaken for a desired time. The solid taken by centrifugation was washed with deionized water until the filtrate reaching 7 in pH, dried at 110 °C and calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 h. The concentration of Co(NO3)2 solution was analyzed by UV-vis spectrum before and after the surface reaction, and with which the x can be calculated from the concentration decrease. b. The catalysts with Co/Ba ratio x ≥ 0.24 were prepared in the following procedures. 1 g BaCO3 powder was added to 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mol/L Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution containing 5 mmol Co(NO3)2, stirred for 3 hours at 40 °C. The other procedures to obtain the catalysts-b are the same as that of the catalysts-a (mentioned above). For the catalysts-b, the Co/Ba ratio of the catalyst was analyzed by ICP AES due to the severe dissolution of BaCO3. For comparison, some catalysts were prepared by other methods. For instance, Co3O4(P) and Co0.24Ba(CP) were prepared by precipitation or coprecipitation [16], Co0.24Ba(IM) was prepared by incipient impregnation. All of the catalyst samples were finally obtained by calcination in air at 500 °C for 3 h. 2.2 Characterization and activity test Morphology of the catalyst was observed on field-emission scanning electron microscope (NOVA NanoSEM 450), and elementary analysis of the sample was detected on scanning electron microscope (QUANTA-450) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. H2-TPR was performed using Chem BET Pulsar TPR/TPD apparatus. 20 mg of catalyst sample was pretreated on line at 500 °C for 20 min in Ar, cooled to 100 °C and exposed to pure O2 in pulses until saturated adsorption. After that, the catalyst was purged in Ar and cooled to 50 °C. Then, the gas stream was switched to 5 vol% H2/Ar (100 mL/min). When the TCD baseline became flat, H2-TPR profile was recorded at temperature ramp rate 10 °C/min. XRD, O2-TPD and BET surface measurements of the samples were the same as those reported in our previous work [16]. Activity test of the catalysts was identical to that reported in the literature [16]. The reaction was carried out in an integral quartz reactor, and gas mixture 2000 ppmv N2O in Ar was fed to 0.200 g catalyst (40-60 mesh) at 20000 h-1. The N2O was analyzed by GC using TCD as detector. Steady-state N2O conversion at each temperature was calculated according to the equation Conv . % = c N 2 O in − c N 2 O out c N 2 O in × 100 % 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural structure of the Co x Ba(CS) catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Co x Ba(CS) catalyst samples (x = 0.24, 0.35 and 0.56). On Co0.24Ba(CS), all diffraction peaks are arisen from BaCO3 (JCPDS 45-1471) and no diffraction peak belonging to cobalt could be observed. However, on Co0.35Ba(CS), a quite weak diffraction peak involving Co3O4 spinel (JCPDS 43-1003) appeared at 2θ = 36.8 °, which can be confirmed by the observation that the peak on Co0.56Ba(CS) became stronger. These results indicate that the Co(NO3)2 concentration is an important factor influencing the cobalt amount depositing on the BaCO3 support. The SEM photographs of the BaCO3 support and the Co0.24Ba(CS) were given in Fig. 2 . For the Co0.24Ba(CS), it seems that a layer of tiny particles with dozens nm in diameter adhered to the primary particles, and the primary particle size is considerably larger compared with that of the support BaCO3. To clarify the distribution of Co in the Co0.24Ba(CS) particles, EDX was scanned on a selected larger particle (Fig. 2C and 2D). It can be seen that the relative content of cobalt with respect to Ba sharply decreased from the particle outer surface to the depth. Combining the results with that given by XRD for the Co x Ba(CS), it can be known that the tiny particles layer is mainly composed of cobalt component, and the primary particle is come from the BaCO3 support. On the other hand, the view of Co0.24Ba(IM) showed outward of the catalyst with bare BaCO3 particles and the aggregates that is probably composed of cobalt component and Ba(NO3)2, as indicated by XRD. The adsorption-deposition of the cobalt on the BaCO3 support endows the Co0.24Ba(CS) catalyst with larger specific surface area (4.7 m2/g) compared with that of the support (2.3 m2/g) (Table 1). It means that accompanying the adsorption-deposition, some new pores were created in the catalyst. The mechanism involving the core-shell structure formation can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 . The much lower solubility product of CoCO3 than that of BaCO3 makes Ba2+ ions substituted by Co2+on the BaCO3 surface. At the same time, the BaCO3 support may be eroded by the acidity of Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.1 M, pH = 5.77), which interprets why the Co0.24Ba(CS) catalyst has much higher Co/Ba atomic ratio than that obtained by the simple substituting of the Ba2+ with Co2+ on the BaCO3 surface (e.g. the sample Co0.0089Ba). The CO3 2- ions thus shed off form the BaCO3 combine with the Co2+ ions, forming CoCO3 at the vicinity of the solid-liquid interface. After calcination, the CoCO3 enriched layer become the Co3O4 crystals promoted by Ba, which should be responsible for some tiny particles deposited on the primary particles outside. 3.2 Specific reaction rate over the Co x Ba(CS) catalysts Fig. 4 shows the specific reaction rate in unit mass of Co3O4 ( r Co3O4) and in unit mass of the catalyst ( r cat.) for N2O decomposition over the Co x Ba(CS) (x = 0.009-0.56) catalysts at 400 °C. With the Co/Ba ratio decreasing, the r Co3O4 significantly increased (Fig. 4A), while no N2O conversion could be detected over BaCO3 support itself. It means that the Co both accessible to the reactant molecules and contacted to barium is more active than the Co without the chemical environment. On the other hand, higher r cat. was given by the catalysts with the larger Co/Ba ratio, and the r cat. increasing versus the Co/Ba ratio became slow when the Co/Ba ratio exceeds to 0.24 (Fig. 4B). The results indicate that for the Co x Ba(CS) catalysts (x = 0.009-0.56), although all of the Co has contribution to the reaction, the effectiveness of them for catalyzing the reaction decreases with the Co/Ba ratio increasing. Clearly, the Co0.24Ba(CS) gave the relative ideal r Co3O4 and r cat.. 3.3 Activity of the Co0.24Ba catalysts influenced by the structure The catalytic performances of the different Co0.24Ba catalysts were compared in Fig. 5 . For the Co0.24Ba(CP) and Co0.24Ba(IM), although they have the same cobalt content as that of Co0.24Ba(CS), their activity is much lower compared with that of the latter. For example, at 400 °C, 100% of N2O conversion was achieved over Co0.24Ba(CS), while over Co0.24Ba(CP) and Co0.24Ba(IM) the N2O conversion just reached to 32% and 19%, respectively. For the three catalysts, the much large difference in activity between them could be well correlated with their structure. As revealed by the SEM photograph, worse dispersion of Co on the support and bad contact of Co to Ba are accountable for the inferior activity of the Co0.24Ba(IM). For the Co0.24Ba(CP), although a better dispersion of Co and the contact could be expected worse accessibility of the Co component deep inside its particles should be responsible for its lower activity. For the Co0.24Ba(CS), the special structure that the Co-enriched shell over the BaCO3 core not only ensured the active component the best accessibility but also made active component modified by barium better. The BaCO3 itself is inert to the H2-TPR, as shown in Fig. 6 . As the Co content in the catalysts is deferent from that in the Co3O4 sample, normalized H2-TPR profiles with respect to definite amount of Co for the Co0.24Ba(CS) and Co0.24Ba(CP) was compared in the figure. Two reduction peaks in the range of 240-350 °C and 350-550 °C, which were ascribed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and Co2+ to Co°[18,19], respectively, appeared on the catalysts. The strength of Co-O bond should be reflected by the temperature where considerable amount of Co3+ begins to be reduced in the H2-TPR. Obviously, the H2 consumption areas due to the Co3+ reduction at lower temperature in the H2-TPR decreased in the order of Co0.24Ba(CS) > Co0.24Ba(CP) > Co3O4(P). For instance, the Co3+ reduction on Co0.24Ba(CS), Co0.24Ba(CP) and Co3O4(P) generated the areas with the ratio 167: 125: 86 before 280 °C, and the ratio 546: 423: 308 before 300 °C. The results clearly indicate that the Co-O bond is effectively weakened by barium for the Co0.24Ba(CS) as well as the Co0.24Ba(CP). However, it appeared to be unintelligible that the contact situation between the cobalt and barium would be better for the Co0.24Ba(CP) compared with Co0.24Ba(CS), why the Co3+ reduction on the Co0.24Ba(CP) is lagging to that on the Co0.24Ba(CS), and why activity of the Co0.24Ba(CP) is even lower than the Co3O4 samples itself (Fig. 5)? The reason is that accessibility of the Co component in the catalyst as another factor influences the H2-TPR and the N2O decomposition for the catalyst. It is reasonable to speculate that most of the Co component existing deep in the catalyst particles is covered by BaCO3 and therefore is difficult in somewhat to be reduced and to catalyze the N2O decomposition. Actually, the situation over the Co0.24Ba(CP) was also appeared in the reduction of Co2+ to Co° in the H2-TPR. It can be clearly observed that the most reduction of Co2+ to Co° occurs at 394 °C over the Co0.24Ba(CS). However, over the Co0.24Ba(CP), although the reduction of Co2+ to Co° considerably occurs at this temperature, the more reduction with stronger peak lagged to 415 °C. The results conversely indicate that the higher accessibility and better transfer of the reactant in the catalyst pores are more important for the catalyst used for N2O decomposition, which explains why the Co0.24Ba(CS) catalyst with the core-shell structure has superior activity compared with the catalyst with uniform structure. 4 Conclusions The core-shell type Co0.24Ba(CS) catalyst was obtained by the adsorption- deposition method, in which Co mainly exists in the outer layer of the catalyst, forming a Co-rich porous shell doped by Ba. The special structure of the Co0.24Ba(CS) made the cobalt in the catalyst properly promoted by barium and easily accessed to the reactant molecules, so it endows the catalyst with not only a high specific reaction rate of unit amount of Co3O4, but also a superior specific activity of unit amount of catalyst in comparison with the catalysts possessing traditional structure.
