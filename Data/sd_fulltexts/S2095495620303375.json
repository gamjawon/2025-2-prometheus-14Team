Graphical abstract Using model catalysts, it is revealed that electron-rich M-N4/C sites are more favorable for oxygen electrocatalysis when noncovalently adsorbed on carbon supports. Transition-metal based M-N4/C catalysts are appealing for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Employing model catalysts, which have well-defined molecular structures and coordination environments, to investigate electrocatalytic performance of M-N4/C sites for ORR and OER is of fundamental significance. Herein, we reported the use of Co tetra(phenyl)porphyrin 1 and Co tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 2 as models to probe the role of Co-N4/C sites for oxygen electrocatalysis. We showed that Co porphyrin 1 is more efficient than its structural analogue 2 for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline aqueous solutions, indicating that the electron-rich Co-N4/C site is more favored when noncovalently adsorbed on carbon supports. This work inspires rational design of reaction-oriented catalysts for sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Keywords Molecular electrocatalysis Model catalyst Oxygen evolution reaction Oxygen reduction reaction Porphyrin Electrocatalytic ORR and OER are involved in many new energy storage and conversion technologies, such as meal-air batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting devices [1–8]. Nevertheless, these two reactions suffer from sluggish kinetics, due to the transfer of multiple electrons and protons, and the rearrangements of several atoms in a concerted manner. As a result, high-performance electrocatalysts for these two reactions are required [9–11]. Noble metal-based catalysts possess benchmarking activity, such as Pt/C for ORR, and IrO2 and RuO2 for OER. However, their large-scale commercialization is limited by the scarcity and the high price of these noble metal elements [12–14]. Designing non-noble metal-based catalysts is thus desired [3,15–23]. First-row transition metal-based complexes, carbon materials, and their hybrids have been largely studied as electrocatalysts for ORR and OER [24–32]. Particularly, transition metal single-atom catalysts have emerged as an outstanding family in the past decade because of their impressed activity, low cost, flexible tunability, and high metal-atom economy [33–40]. With previous studies, it is suggested that the M-N4/C sites are the active sites for oxygen electrocatalysis [41–44]. By chelating the metal site with four surrounding N atoms, the migration and agglomeration of metal ions can be effectively controlled [4]. Meanwhile, the flexible connections of carbon matrix in sp2 hybridization realize the design of targeted nanoarchitectures with favorable electron transfer and full exposure of active sites [45]. As a result, M-N4/C sing-atom catalysts demonstrate high performance in these electrocatalytic reactions [46,47]. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to revealing the regime of M-N4/C sites in oxygen electrocatalysis. Co and Fe are unveiled to be nearest to the top of the Sabatier volcano curves, and are generally identified as the most active metal sites in ORR and OER [48–56]. Further, it is revealed that Cr, which is typically thought to be not active for oxygen electrocatalysis, can also demonstrate a great activity when Cr-N4/C moieties are implanted in an appropriate coordination environment [57]. Similar scenario is also disclosed for Zn-N4/C catalysts [58]. Besides, the physiochemical properties of carbon matrix are found to have a prominent impact on the efficiency of M-N4/C sites [59]. Recently, the edge-trapped M-N4/C catalysts are unclosed to present a higher activity for ORR than the center ones [60]. Theoretical calculations further unveiled that the edge-located M-N4/C moieties possess a higher electron density than the center ones, leading to a lower gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. It is obvious that the cooperation environments play a vital role in M-N4/C sites for oxygen electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the investigations are mainly based on high-performance but complicated material systems, generally synthesized by precursor pyrolysis. In the case, the co-exist of different types of active sites, such as various N dopants, and different kinds of defects, challenges the investigations to identify the intrinsic role of M-N4/C sites in oxygen electrocatalysis, and further hampers the rational design of new efficient catalysts [61]. Therefore, employing model catalysts to unambiguously investigate the oxygen electrocatalytic performances of M-N4/C sites is of fundamental significance. In this work, we used molecular model complexes, Co tetra(phenyl)porphyrin 1 and Co tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 2 (Fig. 1 ), to probe the electrocatalytic performance of M-N4/C sites for ORR and OER. Metal porphyrins with the M-N4/C coordination environment are shown to be active for oxygen electrocatalysis [2,43,50,51,62]. The rigid square-planar coordination between porphyrin ligands and metal ions delivers a great stability for the complexes, against metal etching even in harsh acidic or alkaline solutions. The negatively charged porphyrin ligands are favored to stabilize metal ions of high oxidation states, which are key intermediates involved in both ORR and OER. Meanwhile, the flexible tunability of the ligands gifts the complexes systematically regulated electronic structures for active sites. We show that electron-rich Co-N4/C sites are more favorable to catalyze ORR and OER when noncovalently adsorbed on carbon supports. This work provides new insights in electrocatalysis based on M-N4/C sites and facilitates the rational design of targeted catalysts for clean energy conversion technologies. Co porphyrins 1 and 2 were synthesized through the coordination of Co2+ ions with corresponding porphyrin ligands. Both complexes were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and UV–vis spectroscopy to confirm their identity and purity (Figs. S3–S6). Co ions with suitable electron filling in the 3d orbits have been demonstrated active for ORR and OER [42]. The square-planar structures of porphyrin ligands deliver a solid cooperation with Co ions, leading to a modulated electronic structures and great stability for electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the slight distortion of the conjugation systems in the porphyrin ligands, derived from the compression of N atoms with lone-pair electrons to the surrounding elements, are favorable for the adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Consequently, Co porphyrins 1 and 2 are expected to exhibit favorable intrinsic activity for oxygen electrocatalysis. In both Co porphyrins 1 and 2, d7 Co2+ ions are coordinated by porphyrin ligands through four N atoms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are utilized to get insights into the specific electronic configurations of the Co-N4/C sites. As shown in Fig. 1, porphyrin ligand with meso-phenyl substituents exerts a little impact on the electron density of the Co-N4/C site. In contrast, a significantly decreased electron density on the Co-N4/C site is observed for 2, which is ascribed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the four meso-pentafluorophenyl substituents. The coordination environments of Co ions can also be disclosed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2 (a and b), two distinct peaks at around 780 and 796 eV are observed in the high-resolution Co 2p region for both 1 and 2. A slight shift to the lower binding energy is evidenced for 2 in comparison with 1 (Fig. 2c), which is attributed to the electron-withdrawing property of meso-pentafluorophenyl substituents of 2. This difference indicates that complex 1 has a higher electron density at the Co-N4/C site than 2, which is consistent with the DFT result. These results all clearly indicate different electron configurations of the Co-N4/C sites in 1 and 2. In junction with the promising activities of porphyrin molecules, 1 and 2 are considered to be the rational models to probe the regime of Co-N4/C active sites in ORR and OER electrocatalysis. Electrocatalytic ORR studies were carried out in 0.1 M KOH solutions using catalyst-loaded working electrode. Co porphyrins were first mixed physically with carbon nanotubes (CNTs, Fig. S7) to promote electric conductivity, thereby securing the direct comparison of the intrinsic activities of the probed model catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 (a and b), no aggregated particles are observed on the surfaces of catalyst-loaded CNTs by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), suggesting that catalyst molecules are uniformly distributed on CNTs. The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of 1/CNTs exhibits a large catalytic ORR wave with a half-wave potential E 1/2 = 0.81 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, all potentials reported in this work are referenced to RHE), while for 2/CNTs, the catalytic ORR wave has E 1/2 = 0.76 V (Fig. 3c). The U-turn observed in the current density for 1/CNTs in the LSV is due to the high ORR activity of the catalyst and the limited mass transfer process of dissolved O2. These results suggest that 1/CNTs possesses a higher ORR electrocatalytic activity than 2/CNTs. Note that 1/CNTs and 2/CNTs show remarkably higher activity than pristine CNTs, suggesting that catalyst molecules of 1 and 2 instead of CNTs are the active sites for ORR. Besides, large limited current densities are also observed for both catalysts, with 5.46 mA cm−2 for 1/CNTs and 5.12 mA cm−2 for 2/CNTs, suggesting fast kinetics and rapid mass transfer for these catalysts. The Tafel slope for 1/CNTs and 2/CNTs are 36.9 mV dec−1 and 43.5 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 3d). All these results show that 1/CNTs has a prominently higher ORR activity than 2/CNTs, implying that Co porphyrins with a high electron density on the Co-N4/C site are more favorable for ORR when noncovalently adsorbed on CNTs. Moreover, the LSVs of 1/CNTs before and after 100 cycle voltammetry (CV) are almost identical, indicating a decent stability of the model catalyst in ORR catalysis (Fig. S8). Electrocatalytic OER studies were carried out in 1.0 M KOH solutions. As shown in Fig. 3(e), a higher activity is also observed for 1/CNTs as compared to 2/CNTs. The overpotential required for reaching 10 mA cm−2 current density is η = 407 mV for 1/CNTs, while it is η = 480 mV for 2/CNTs. Evident chemical oxidation peaks are not observed in the LSV curves of the model catalysts due to the considerably low content of the cobalt elements. A negligible current density is also observed for pristine CNTs under similar conditions. In addition, 1/CNTs displays a smaller Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec−1 as compared to the value of 71.6 mV dec−1 with 2/CNTs (Fig. 3f). The electrochemical double-layer capacitance is measured to represent the electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA). As shown in Fig. S9, 1/CNTs and 2/CNTs deliver high ECSA due to the contribution of the carbon substrates. Benefited from the support of carbon matrix and the uniform distribution of the molecules on the substrates, the mass transfer process and active site accessibility are greatly promoted, which secures the investigation of the intrinsic activity for the probed catalysts. To gain more insight into the charge transfer process during electrocatalysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further explored. As shown in Fig.S10, 1/CNTs presents a smaller semicircle than 2/CNTs, suggesting that the favorable electronic structures of active sites on 1/CNTs more facilitate charge transfer between the catalyst surface and electrode as compared to 2/CNTs. These results show that 1/CNTs is more active than 2/CNTs to catalyze OER, implying that electron-rich Co-N4-C sites are more favorable for OER when noncovalently adsorbed on CNTs. The durability of 1/CNTs is examined, showing almost identical LSVs before and after 100 cycle CV tests (Fig. S11). On the basis of electrocatalytic ORR and OER activities of 1/CNTs and 2/CNTs, we used these catalysts to assemble aqueous rechargeable zinc-air batteries and examined their performance under practical cell conditions. The home-made batteries were assembled with polished Zn foil as the anode, and catalyst-loaded carbon cloth/gas diffusion layer as the cathode (Fig. 4 a). The electrolyte is 6.0 M KOH with 0.2 M Zn acetate, to ensure the reversible reactions when charging. As seen in Fig. 4(b), the battery based on 1/CNTs presents evidently shrunken charge–discharge polarization data as compared to 2/CNTs, suggesting better battery performance in both charging and discharging processes. As a result, a larger peak power density of 155.7 mW cm−2 was obtained for 1/CNTs, considerably higher than that of 84.5 mW cm−2 using 2/CNTs. Besides, when cycled at a constant current density of 2.0 mA cm−2, the stable charge-discharge platforms were observed for batteries based on both 1/CNTs and 2/CNTs, indicating great battery rechargeability and stability from the two catalysts. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4(c), a small charge-discharge gap is evidenced for 1/CNTs with a high energy efficiency of 52.7%, which is significantly larger than that of 2/CNTs (31.5%). These results manifest the greater charge–discharge performance of the battery with 1/CNTs as compared to that with 2/CNTs. This result is consistent with the results obtained in the three-electrode systems. In summary, Co porphyrins were employed as model catalysts to probe the role of M-N4/C sites on ORR and OER. The unique electron configuration of Co ions and the stable square-planar coordination environment from porphyrin ligands deliver excellent activity and durability for these model catalysts in oxygen electrocatalysis. We show that electron-rich Co M-N4/C sites are more active for both ORR and OER when noncovalently adsorbed on CNTs. Note that the noncovalent interactions between catalyst molecules and CNTs may also exert an impact on electrocatalytic performance [63]. Detailed investigations of the activity difference between 1 and 2 are the on-going projects in our lab. This work provides new insights for electrocatalysis on M-N4/C sites by using structure-defined model catalysts, which enlightens the rational design of high-performance catalysts for clean energy conversion technologies.

        "dc:description": "Transition-metal based M-N4/C catalysts are appealing for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Employing model catalysts, which have well-defined molecular structures and coordination environments, to investigate electrocatalytic performance of M-N4/C sites for ORR and OER is of fundamental significance. Herein, we reported the use of Co tetra(phenyl)porphyrin 1 and Co tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 2 as models to probe the role of Co-N4/C sites for oxygen electrocatalysis. We showed that Co porphyrin 1 is more efficient than its structural analogue 2 for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline aqueous solutions, indicating that the electron-rich Co-N4/C site is more favored when noncovalently adsorbed on carbon supports. This work inspires rational design of reaction-oriented catalysts for sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies.",
