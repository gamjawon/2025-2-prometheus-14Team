Graphical abstract Highly dispersed (Ce,Cr)xO2 in Nb2O5 matrix can enhance the strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, facilitating acid-redox synergy to improve catalytic performance for DCE destruction. CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 mixed oxides were synthesized by three different methods (coprecipitation, deposition-precipitation and mechanical mixing) and subjected for 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) deep oxidation tests. Detailed characterizations such as XRD, UV-Raman, N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, XPS, NH3-TPD and H2-TPR were performed. Results show that the synergistic effect between redox and acid properties are critical for promoting the catalytic oxidation of DCE. The CeCrNb-cp prepared by coprecipitation method presents larger specific surface area and mesopore volume as well as smaller particle sizes. Moreover, the highly dispersed state of (Ce,Cr)xO2 in the Nb2O5 matrix can enhance the strong interaction between Nb2O5 and (Ce,Cr)xO2, facilitate the synergy between surface acid sites and oxidation sites, thus improving the destructive efficiency of DCE. The CeCrNb-cp catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for DCE destruction, high selectivity for less toxic products (HCl and CO2), scarce formation of chlorinated byproduct (C2H3Cl) and relatively good durability, all of which indicates it would be promising for potential industrial application. Keywords 1,2-Dichloroethane Deep oxidation Mixed oxide Nb2O5 Synergistic effect 1 Introduction Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) produced from various industrial and civil process have become serious threats to both human health and eco-systems due to their toxic bio-chemical properties [1,2]. Catalytic oxidation is widely recognized as an economical and effective technique for low concentration Cl-VOCs elimination, since it can destroy Cl-VOCs without producing extra pollutants [3,4]. So far, supported noble metal catalysts [5–7] and metal oxide catalysts [8–12] are two major categories of catalysts that have been successfully commercialized for Cl-VOCs deep oxidation. Supported noble metal catalysts usually show better oxidation activity, but they tend to form polychlorinated byproducts with chlorine species, causing catalyst poisoning and deactivation. Such poisoning issue and high costs remain serious challenges for supported noble metal catalysts. Metal oxide catalysts exhibit better resistance against chlorine poisoning along with lower cost, and they have also been investigated and used extensively as substitution for noble metal catalysts. In recent years, CeO2-based mixed oxides [11–15] have attracted lots of attentions for Cl-VOCs elimination, since CeO2 possesses high oxygen mobility and can readily achieve the redox cycle between Ce4+ and Ce3+. Among the CeO2 mixed oxides reported, (Ce,Cr)xO2 mixed oxide exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for deep oxidation of Cl-VOCs due to its high oxidizing ability [11,12]. On the other hand, our previous studies [16–19] have demonstrated the introductions of high-valence metal oxides (TiO2, WO3, MoO3, ZrO2 and Nb2O5 etc.) and H-type zeolites with abundant acid sites (also known as “solid-acid” catalysts) are a promising method in improving the catalytic activity at low temperature, thermal stability as well as other physico-chemical properties of the CeO2-based materials such as (Ce,Cr)xO2/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. However, due to the strong surface acidity of zeolites, coke deposition always occurs during the oxidation process and causes catalyst deactivation. Nb2O5 has been widely used in acid-catalyzed reactions (such as NH3-SCR) due to its remarkable acid properties [20], but it is rarely reported in the field of Cl-VOCs oxidation. In order to further promote the catalytic performances for Cl-VOCs deep oxidation over CeO2-based mixed oxides, combining CeO2-based mixed oxides with solid-acid oxides would be a promising strategy. In this work, Nb2O5 is chosen as a typical solid-acid supporting material, and three CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 catalysts are synthesized through different preparation methods. These catalysts are evaluated for DCE deep catalytic oxidation and subjected to further characterizations. The scope of this paper is to focus on investigating the structure-activity relationship of Nb2O5 promoting CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 catalysts, meanwhile to acquire some further understanding about the synergistic effect between surface acid sites and oxidation sites in the CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Coprecipitation method Ce(NO3)3, Cr(NO3)3 (Ce to Cr molar ratio was 4:1) and Nb(HC2O4)5 were first dissolved in deionized water, and then 0.50 mol L−1 (NH4)2CO3 was added dropwise under continuous stirring until the final pH reached 9.0. After ageing at 25 °C for 12 h, the precipitate was filtered, washed by deionized water and dried in ethanol under super critical condition (265 °C, 2 h, 7.5 Mpa). The solid was then calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h. 2.1.2 Deposition-precipitation method Nb2O5 was added into Ce(NO3)3 and Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution (Ce to Cr molar ratio was 4:1), and then ultrasonic oscillated for 1 h. 0.50 mol L−1 (NH4)2CO3 was then added dropwise under continuous stirring until the final pH reached 9.0. After aged at 25 °C for 12 h, the precipitate was filtered, washed by deionized water and dried in ethanol under super critical condition (265 °C, 2 h, 7.5 Mpa). The solid was then calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h. 2.1.3 Mechanical mixing method (Ce,Cr)xO2 mixed oxide (Ce to Cr molar ratio was 4:1) was first prepared through a similar coprecipitation procedure and was well-mixed with Nb2O5 through sufficient grinding. All the obtained catalysts were subject to palletization process before tests. First, certain amount of powder catalysts is placed in the tablet mold and compressed for 5 min using hydraulic compressor. Then, the obtained catalyst tablets were break mechanically and sifted through two-layer sieves (usually 40 and 60 mesh respectively). Those left between the two-layer sieves are the desired catalyst pellets and can be subject to further tests. The catalysts prepared by coprecipitation, deposition-precipitation and mechanical mixing methods were labeled as CeCrNb-cp, CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-mm respectively, while the (Ce,Cr)xO2 to Nb2O5 mass ratio was 1:4 in all the obtained catalysts. 2.2 Catalyst characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an R-ASIX RAPID X-ray Diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation) using Cu Kα radiation. The diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 250 mA and the diffraction patterns were recorded at 0.02° step-size in the range of 20–80° (2θ), with the counting time of 2.5 s per step. N2 adsorption and desorption was carried out using a Coulter OMNISORP-100 apparatus −196 °C. All the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 200 °C for 2 h. Specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. UV–Raman spectrum was obtained on a LabRam-HR800 with a 325 nm He–Gd laser source. The spectral resolution was 4 cm−1, with a scanning range of 150–2000 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on a Thermo K-Alpha system equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated using C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a SU1510 apparatus. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with TCD detector. 100 mg samples were first pretreated in N2 at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 100 °C, 20 vol.% NH3/N2 flow (30 mL min−1)was inlet for 0.5 h, and then purged with N2 for 1 h. The desorption process was carried out in N2 (40 mL min−1) by raising the temperature from 100 °C to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All the profiles were simulated by Gaussian functions. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction of (H2-TPR) was conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with TCD detector. After pretreating in N2 at 200 °C for 30 min, the sample was reduced in 5 vol.% H2/Ar flow (40 mL min−1) by raising the temperature from 50 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 2.3 Catalytic activity tests Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. 500 mg catalyst was loaded and the feed flow consisted of 1000 ppmv DCE and dry air as balance, with a total flow of 75 mL min−1. The DCE concentration, as well as possible organic byproducts in the outlet gas was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography equipped with FID and TCD detector. When DCE was completely converted, the waste gas was bubbled through a 0.0125 mol L−1 NaOH solution for 20 min. The Cl− concentration in the solution was determined by Cl− selective electrode, while the Cl2 concentration in the solution was determined by chemical titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) using N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) sulfate as the indicator. HCl selectivity was calculated as SHCl = [HCl]/([HCl] + [Cl2]). Effect of different inlet gas mixture were also investigated by introducing 1000 ppmv benzene or 2.3% water vapor into the reactor. The catalyst durability was also evaluated through the same procedure at 265 °C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Results of catalytic performance 3.1.1 Evaluation of DCE oxidation Fig.1 (A) presents the DCE conversion curves of all the obtained catalysts. According to the T50% values (temperature for 50% conversion), the catalytic activity follows the order as: CeCrNb-cp (213 °C) > (Ce,Cr)xO2 (226 °C) > CeCrNb-dp (230 °C) > CeCrNb-mm (248 °C) > Nb2O5 (304 °C), which is also in consistent with the sequence of T90% values (temperature for 90% conversion). (Ce,Cr)xO2 shows a relatively low T50% value possibly due to its strong oxidation ability. However, CeCrNb-cp still exhibits highest catalytic activity and its T50% value is much lower than single (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 samples. The calculated apparent activation energy (see Fig. S1) shows that the apparent activation energy of CeCrNb-cp (31.3 kJ mol−1) is significantly reduced compared to (Ce,Cr)xO2 (43.4 kJ mol−1) and Nb2O5 (41.4 kJ mol−1). These results indicate there exists obvious synergistic effect between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, and such synergistic effect is beneficial for DCE destruction and is most likely related to the high dispersion of active component in the catalysts prepared by coprecipitation method [17]. Scarce amount of C2H3Cl is detected as the only C-containing byproduct and no other C-containing byproducts (such as phosgene, chloroform, CCl4 and dioxins) were detected over the catalysts (Fig. 1(B)). The maximum concentration of C2H3Cl increased in the order as: (Ce,Cr)xO2 < CeCrNb-cp < CeCrNb-dp < CeCrNb-mm < Nb2O5. For Nb2O5, noticeable amount of C2H3Cl (maximum 40 ppm at 400 °C, not shown) is detected and wasn’t destroyed even at 480 °C. For (Ce,Cr)xO2, although it shows the minimum C2H3Cl production, its selectivity towards HCl was quite unsatisfying when compared with other catalysts (Table 1 ), which can be possibly caused by its strong oxidation ability in oxidizing C2H3Cl into the undesirable toxic Cl2. Among all the catalysts, CeCrNb-cp shows relatively lower C2H3Cl production with high selectivity towards CO2 (more than 98%, not listed) and HCl (see Table 1). These results indicate the synergistic effect between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 is not only beneficial for degrading DCE into C2H3Cl, but also facilitating C2H3Cl oxidation into nontoxic final products. Thus, CeCrNb-cp would be one of the potentially best-in-class catalysts for DCE elimination without generating toxic products. 3.1.2 Influence of benzene or water DCE oxidation activity is also evaluated with additional 1000 ppmv benzene or 2.3% water vapor to better simulate practical conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 (A), the T50% values for DCE oxidation on both CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-cp are increased in the presence of either 1000 ppmv benzene or 2.3% water, indicating that both water and benzene inhibits DCE oxidation possibly related to competitive adsorption/oxidation on the surface active sites [12,16], especially under the presence of benzene. Notably, CeCrNb-cp still shows obvious higher activity than CeCrNb-dp for DCE oxidation. For the byproduct (Fig. 2(B)), lower concentration of C2H3Cl is observed in the presence of water on both CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-cp catalysts. This can be explained that the water vapor promotes the removal of surface Cl species through HCl formation [5,18], which can facilitate the recovery of surface OH group and therefore promote the protonation and further oxidation of C2H3Cl. However, in the presence of benzene, the maximum concentration of C2H3Cl increases on both CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-cp catalysts, which is related to the partially occupation of surface active sites by benzene, as both catalysts show preferred catalytic activity towards benzene oxidation (total conversion under 350 °C). For benzene oxidation reaction, the catalytic activity is mainly determined by surface oxidation properties. In the CeCrNb-dp catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitation method, strong oxidation sites such as Cr6+ species may be exposed on the surface of Nb2O5 support, thus CeCrNb-dp shows obvious higher benzene oxidation activity than CeCrNb-cp. 3.1.3 Durability of the catalysts The durability tests were also performed at 265 °C by changing different inlet gas mixture and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . In the first 10 h stage, the inlet gas consisted only DCE and dry air. (Ce,Cr)xO2 shows relatively good durability and the DCE conversion decreased gradually possibly due to the slight coking and Cl species deposition on the catalyst surface [11,21], which can be further validated by TG-MS analysis of the used samples (see Fig. S2). In the second 10 h stage, 2.3% water vapor is introduced and the DCE conversion over (Ce,Cr)xO2 decreases accordingly; When water is removed from the inlet gas in the third 10 h stage, DCE conversion can fully recovered, suggesting the activity decrease is caused by H2O competitive adsorption. In the fourth 10 h stage, as 1000 ppmv benzene is introduced, DCE conversion decreases more sharply than the second 10 h stage. When benzene is switched off in the final stage, DCE conversion wasn’t able to fully recover. This is more likely to related to severe coke formation with benzene in the reaction atmosphere. For CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-cp catalysts, similar durability results can be observed with no obvious evidence of improvement. 3.2 Results of catalyst characterizations 3.2.1 Structural/textural properties The results of the N2 adsorption–desorption tests are listed in Fig. 4 and Table 1. It can be seen that all the three catalysts show typical mesoporous structures. CeCrNb-dp and CeCrNb-mm catalysts shows similar pore-size distributions range from 3 to 20 nm, mainly concentrates on 4 nm and 7.5 nm. CeCrNb-cp catalyst shows a narrower mesopore distribution range from 3 to 20 nm, indicating more uniform particle size can be obtained by coprecipitation method. Moreover, CeCrNb-cp catalyst possesses largest specific surface area and pore volume, with smallest average pore diameter (see Table 1). Previous studies have demonstrated that the catalytic activities for Cl-VOCs are not directly linked with textural properties, although larger specific surface is beneficial for exposing active sites. For CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 mixed oxides, the key factors for the activity improvement are still related to the existing interaction and synergistic effect between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, which will be discussed later in this article. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of all the catalysts, and the corresponding crystallite sizes are listed in Table 1. The feature diffraction peaks of TT-phase Nb2O5 (at 2θ = 22.6, 28.5, 36.7, 46.2 and 50.6°, respectively) [19] and cubic CeO2 (at 2θ = 28.6, 33.0, 47.6, and 56.4°, respectively) [16] appear for all three catalysts. The characteristic peaks of Cr2O3 (at 2θ = 33.6, 36.3 and 54.9°) [17] are not detected mainly due to the low content or well dispersion of Cr species. For CeCrNb-cp catalyst, the characteristic peaks of CeO2 and Nb2O5 is both widened and weakened, revealing the formation of small crystallites. The sequence of crystallite size follows as: CeCrNb-cp < CeCrNb-dp < CeCrNb-mm. Together with the activity results, we can see that the highly dispersed nanoparticles in the CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 mixed oxides are beneficial for enhancing their interaction and promoting the synergistic effect between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, thus leads to the improved catalytic activity. UV–Raman profiles of all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . All the catalysts show a characteristic peak at 325 cm−1, which can be assigned to the LO vibration mode related to the defect spaces of oxygen vacancy in the metal oxide lattice; two peaks at 687 and 810 cm−1 can be observed, which can be assigned to symmetrical stretching vibration of Nb-O bond in both surface N2O5[NbO6] and [NbO4] structure [22,23]; and three peaks at 460, 587 and 1176 cm−1, which can be assigned to symmetrical stretching vibration of Ce-O bond in the [CeO4] structure [12,22,23]. No Raman signal assigning to Cr2O3 is observed. For CeCrNb-cp catalyst, the characteristic peak assigning to CeO2 is quite weak, and the profile mainly present Nb2O5 related peaks. The peak intensity of CeO2 characteristic peaks follow the sequences as: CeCrNb-cp < CeCrNb-dp < CeCrNb-mm, possibly due to the smaller crystallite size of CeO2 in CeCrNb-cp catalyst. All these results agree well with the XRD characterization results. XPS results are shown in Fig. 7 and surface element content are listed in Table 2 . In the Ce 3d spectra shown in Fig. 7(A), two peaks observed at u' (901.9 eV) and v' (883.8 eV) are the characteristics of the Ce3+ species, which are generally related to the formation of oxygen vacancies [24,25]. In the Cr 2p spectra shown in Fig. 7(B), two peaks of Cr 2p at 578.6 eV and 587.4 eV are associated with Cr (VI) species, while the peaks at 576.2 eV and 585.5 eV are related to Cr (III) species [26,27]. Our previous studies [28] have revealed such Cr6+ species result from the strong interaction between CrOx and CeO2 [28]. In the he Nb 3d spectra shown in Fig. 7(C), two peaks around 207.4 eV and 210.2 eV are the characteristics of the Nb5+3d 5/2 and Nb5+3d 3/2 species [22,23]. It is worth noticing that the binding energies of Nb5+ in CeCrNb-cp and CeCrNb-dp are quite close, but they are all much lower than that in single Nb2O5. This is another clear evidence for the strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, as partial surface Nb5+ was reduced to lower valence state Nbx+ ions, thus shows lower binding energies in the Nb 3d spectra. In the O 1s spectra shown in Fig. 7(D), two characteristic peaks at 532.8 eV and 530.6 eV represent the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in the Nb2O5 respectively, while the other two peaks at 531.3 eV and 529.1 eV represent the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in the (Ce,Cr)xO2 mixed oxides respectively [14,22,29]. Table 2 summaries the element distribution and ion content on the catalysts surface. As can be seen, the values of Ce3+/Ce and Cr6+/Cr increase in the same order as CeCrNb-cp > CeCrNb-dp > (Ce,Cr)xO2, indicating the strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 can increase the surface Ce3+ and Cr6+ content, thus enhancing the redox abilities and benefiting activity improvement. The surface/lattice oxygen ratio is significantly decreased in either CeCrNb-cp and CeCrNb-dp compared to (Ce,Cr)xO2, indicating the strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 can also promote the transformation from surface adsorbed oxygen to lattice oxygen. For the Cl-VOCs deep oxidation, the adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen species are considered to benefit from such transformation from surface adsorbed oxygen to lattice oxygen, resulting in enhanced oxidation ability. Such benefitting effect of the transformation from surface adsorbed oxygen to lattice oxygen can be observed clearly under the oxygen deficient conditions by conducting the DCE oxidation tests under different O2 concentration (see Fig. S3). 3.2.2 Morphology characterization SEM images are shown in Fig. 8 (A)–(C). For CeCrNb-dp catalysts, the “snow-like” (Ce,Cr)xO2 particles are well dispersed on the sheet-shaped Nb2O5 surface. For CeCrNb-mm, (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 are independently agglomerated with no close contact observed, mainly because they are simply physical mixed together. For CeCrNb-cp catalyst, SEM image shows uniform sheet-shaped particles with smaller sizes, and neither amorphous nor independently dispersed particles can be seen. This result suggests homogenous dispersion of (Ce,Cr)xO2 mixed oxides in the Nb2O5 matrix, which is in consistent with the XRD results. 3.2.3 Acidity properties Surface acidity properties are characterized by NH3-TPD and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . As can be seen in Fig. 9(A), three distinct desorption peaks are observed over all the catalysts. The peaks below 150 °C are generally recognized as the physical adsorbed NH3. Two peaks in the range of 150–400 °C can be observed, as peak α appearing at relatively lower temperature is ascribed to surface weak acid sites, while peak β appearing at relatively higher temperature is assigned to strong acid sites [16,17]. It is clearly seen that NH3 desorption peak over CeCrNb-cp catalyst is much larger than the rest two catalysts. Fig. 9(B) correlates the surface acid concentration to the catalytic activities (represented by T50% values) of all the three catalysts. The concentrations of surface weak acid sites (W), strong acid sites (S), as well as the total acid sites (S + W) all decrease in the order as: CeCrNb-cp > CeCrNb-dp > CeCrNb-mm, which is in good consistent with the order of catalytic activities obtained from DCE degradation tests. These results indicate that the surface acidity has significant impact on the catalytic activities for DCE decomposition. Increasing surface acidity would be favorable for the dehydrochlorination of DCE into C2H3Cl. However, the revealed acidity order is not consistent well with the maximum concentration of byproduct C2H3Cl detected during DCE decomposition tests, indicating that the overall catalytic performances are not only determined by the surface acid properties, but also related to the redox ability of the catalyst. The synergistic effect between the redox ability and acid property should play important roles in Cl-VOCs deep oxidation. 3.2.4 Redox properties H2-TPR profiles of all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 . Obvious H2 consumption peaks can be observed in three temperature ranges as: 200–450 °C, 450–700 °C and above 700 °C, representing reduction of different MOx species. For CeCrNb-dp catalyst, three reduction peaks can be observed. Peak α (200 °C–350 °C) is ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ species to Cr3+ species while peak β (350 °C–410 °C) is ascribed to the reduction of surface/sub-surface oxygen in Nb2O5 [19,29–31]. Peak γ (450 °C–700 °C) is ascribed to the reduction of either surface/sub-surface oxygen in CeO2 or small Cr2O3 particles [32,33] and the peak at high temperature(above 700 °C) is ascribed to the reduction of CeO2 lattice oxygen [17]. For CeCrNb-cp catalyst, both peak α and peak β shift to relatively lower temperature, suggesting the strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 can enhance the reduction of both Cr6+ species and surface/sub-surface oxygen in Nb2O5, which is beneficial for the further oxidation of reaction byproducts generated during Cl-VOCs deep oxidation. Besides, peak γ over CeCrNb-cp catalyst extends to higher temperature with broadened peak width, meanwhile reduction peak of lattice oxygen shifts to lower temperature. This is another evidence of the existing strong interaction. For CeCrNb-mm catalyst, both peak α and peak β appear at higher temperature and overlaps with peak γ, implying its relatively weak redox ability due to weakened interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5 under loose physical contact condition, thus leads to worst catalytic performance in DCE decomposition. 4 Conclusions Three CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 catalysts were synthesized by coprecipitation, deposition-precipitation and mechanical mixing methods respectively, and evaluated for DCE deep oxidation. Among all the catalysts tested, CeCrNb-cp catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method shows better catalytic activity, higher selectivity to HCl and CO2, scarce formation of C2H3Cl byproduct, as well as good durability either in dry air or in additional water and benzene. The synergistic effect between acidity and redox properties proves to be essential for promoting the catalytic oxidation of DCE over CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 catalysts. Further characterizations attribute such synergy to (i) DCE adsorption and dehydrochlorination promoted by strong acid sites and (ii) the deep oxidation of byproducts as well as the reduction of surface coke and Cl deposition promoted by the strong oxidation sites. Meanwhile the highly dispersed state of (Ce,Cr)xO2 in the Nb2O5 matrix can enhance the existing strong interaction between (Ce,Cr)xO2 and Nb2O5, facilitate the synergy between surface acid sites and oxidation sites, further improving the destructive efficiency of DCE. The revealed high activity, selectivity as well as durability suggests that CeO2-CrOx-Nb2O5 system is worth further exploration and might be promising for potential industrial application.
