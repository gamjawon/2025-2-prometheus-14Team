The CuO/YSZ/y-alumina catalysts were character- ized by TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), TPO (temperature-programmed oxidation) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The bulk-like copper oxide can exhibit a two-step reduction (i.e., Cu~+ ~ Cu+ ~ Cu, while isolated Cue+ ions cannot. This has been attributed to a \"long- range\" electronic effect caused by the strong electronegativity of chlorine, which comes from the decomposition of the YSZ precursors. An experiment employing chlorine-containing CuO/y- alumina catalysts, of which the chlorine content was controlled by adding HC1 to the impregnating solution, has confirmed that the two-step reduction behavior is caused by the chlorine. In addition, it was found that the residual chlorine not only improves the dispersion of supported copper oxide but also enhances the oxidizability of the reduced copper.

Introduction Many catalyst studies have increasingly focused on oxygen-ion conducting oxides [1-8]. Previous studies indicated that using such materials (a) as supports could significantly enhance the catalytic activity of Pt [1], Rh [4] and CuO [5,7] for CO oxidation and NO reduction, or (b) as catalysts might enhance the selectivity of CO hydrogenation [2,3] and the decomposition rate of formic acid [8]. These improvements in catalytic activity have been attributed to the effects * Corresponding author. Tel. (+886-35) 716260, fax.

Huang /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 17-29 of oxygen ionic transport [1,4,5,7], interfacial metal-support interaction (IMSI) [1,5,7] or surface oxygen vacancies of these oxygen-ion conducting oxides [2,3,7,8]. Our previous studies [5-7] have demonstrated that the oxygen-ion conducting support, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), can markedly enhance the reducibility of supported copper oxide and improve the catalytic activity of a copper oxide catalyst. More specifically, the YSZ support can improve the light-off behavior of a copper oxide catalyst for CO oxidation [7], which is unexpected since the base-metal oxides generally have poorer light-off behavior than that of precious metals [9]. This activity enhancement of YSZ supported copper oxide catalysts has been ascribed to the modification of the reaction mechanism and the synergistic effect caused by the interfacial metal oxide-support interaction (IMOSI) [7]. Hence, extending the interfacial boundary line between the sup- ported copper oxide and the YSZ support should significantly enhance the copper oxide activity for CO oxidation. Dispersing YSZ crystallites on y-alumina support could be a feasible alterna- tive for application purposes. Such an action cannot only extend the interfacial boundary line but may also reduce the usage requirement of YSZ. However, if the precursor metal salts of supported YSZ are chlorides such as YC13 and ZrCI4, it should first be considered whether chlorine is a contaminant, since many studies have reported that the residual chlorine coming from the precursor chloride salts can affect the catalysts' physical and chemical properties. For instance, chlorine can (a) improve the dispersion of supported metals [10-12], (b) change the catalysts' activity and selectivity [13,14], and (c) affect the crystallization of the ZrO2 support [15]. Moreover, chlorine can significantly reduce both the adsorption rate and capacity of a metal surface [16,17]. In fact, C1 can lead to a more serious poisoning effect than S and P owing to its stronger electronegativity [16,17]. Therefore, this work examines (a) the effects of chlorine, which comes from the precursor metal salts of YSZ supported on y-alumina, on the reduction and reoxidation behaviors of supported copper oxide and (b) the feasibility of preparing the YSZ/y-alumina support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Support and catalyst preparation YSZ/y-alumina supports were prepared by a co-impregnation method. Ap- propriate amounts of ZrC14 (Strem, 99.6%) and YC13 6H20 (Aldrich, 99.9%) was dissolved in deionized water, and y-alumina (Strem, 150-200 mesh) was then added to the solution. After evaporating the excess water at ca. 60, the slurry was dried in air at 120 for 12 h, calcined in air at 700 for 4 h and Wei-Pin Dow, T.-J.

CI/(CI + Cu); .... means unknown value. then immediately quenched in water to maintain a cubic fluorite-type structure of the supported YSZ. The yttria content in all y-alumina supported YSZ is 8 mol%. The copper oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnating supports with an appropriate amount of aqueous solution of copper nitrate (Strem, 99.999%). After evaporating the excess water at 80, the catalysts were dried in air at 120 for 24 h and then calcined in air at 260 for 1.5 h and at 500 for 3.5 h. The chlorine effect was next investigated by preparing several chlorine-con- taining CuO/y-alumina catalysts. The chlorine contents in this work were those during impregnation by controlling the added amount of HC1. The chlorine content is represented with mol percentage and with respect to the copper content, i.e., C1/(C1 + Cu). After the chlorine-containing catalysts were calcined in air at 500, some chlorine might be removed from the catalysts due to the formations of C12 and HC1 [14,15,18]. Accordingly, the C1/Cu ratios of those chlorine-containing catalysts are unknown after calcination. However, the chlo- rine contents of these catalysts must be lower than their original values during impregnation. In addition, the more HC1 added would likely cause a higher residual amount of chlorine under the same calcination conditions. Table 1 lists the compositions of CuO/YSZ/y-alumina catalysts. This table also provides their codes as directly related to the curves in TPR and TPO figures. 20 Wei-Pin Dow, T.-J. Huang /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 17-29 2.2. Catalyst and support characterization The BET areas of various supports were determined by nitrogen physisorp- tion, as applied via a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) instrument. The phase composition of the supported YSZ was determined from XRD patterns (Shimadzu, Model XD-5) using Cu K o~1 radiation. Next, the chlorine effect on valence variation and structure transformation of the supported copper oxide during reduction was revealed by interrupting several TPR tests with immediate cooling-down when the TPR had run to a particular temperature. These TPR samples were then taken to run XRD immediately, thereby allowing a quasi-in situ XRD detection of these supported copper species and providing valuable information into the chlorine effect. 2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) TPR of the catalysts was performed using 10% hydrogen in nitrogen as the reducing gas. The gas flow rate was 30 ml/min and adjusted by mass flow controllers. The gas flow system of the TPR apparatus was composed of two 6-pore valves. Hydrogen consumption of the TPR was detected by a TCD; its signal was transmitted to a personal computer. The peak areas of TPR could also be separated and integrated by this computer using a software program. Also, the temperature was controlled by a programmable controller (Eurotherm, Model 815P). The cell used for TPR was made of an 8 mm I.D. quartz U tube and the catalyst sample of 100 or 200 mg was mounted on loosely packed quartz-wool. Next, the outlet of the TPR cell was connected to a glass column packed with a molecular sieve 5A to remove the moisture produced during reduction. The system and method of TPO are similar to those of TPR. Following a TPR run, the TPO was carried out using 3% oxygen in argon as an oxidizing gas. The gas flow rate was 30 ml/min and was adjusted by mass flow controllers. Oxygen consumption of TPO was also detected by a TCD and its signal was transmitted to a personal computer. The sample weight used for TPO was 100 mg. 3. Results and discussion Table 2 summarizes the BET areas of various supports. Both supported YSZ and copper oxide can reduce the BET area of the ,/-alumina support. However, experimental results indicate that the influence of supporting copper oxide on reducing the BET area is more significant than that of supporting YSZ.

This figure clearly reveals that the cubic fluorite-type YSZ has been formed on y-alumina within our preparation conditions because no XRD pattern of monoclinic or tetragonal zirconia is found in Fig. lb and Fig. lc. This would suggest that nearly all the supported zirconia can be stabilized by yttria via the co-impregnation method. Many investigators have examined y-alumina supported copper oxide cata- lysts [19-26]. The structure of copper oxide and the environment of copper ions supported on alumina are complicated. However, only two types of copper ions, isolated (well-dispersed) and clustered (bulk-like) ions, are normally detectable by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [20,22], TPR [23], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [26-28] and XRD [19,20,22]. This is despite the fact that Tikhov et al. [24,25] could distinguish between various types of copper oxide species on alumina support. A previous work [6] indicated that four peaks, i.e., c~I, c~2, /3 and y, can be found in the TPR patterns of CuO/YSZ catalysts, while only two peaks, /3 and ,ca , g.

The a-peak temperature is lower than that of /3 and y peaks with a difference of ca. 50. The formation of c~l and a2 peaks has been attributed to the hydrogen consumption of interface-boundary terminal oxygen ions of the supported CuO caused by the surface oxygen vacancies of the YSZ support [6]. The fl-peak formation is due to the reduction of several highly dispersed copper oxide species, which include isolated Cu2+ ions, weak magnetic associates and small two- and three-dimensional copper oxide clusters [6]. The y-peak formation is due to the reduction of large three-dimensional copper oxide clusters and bulk CuO phase [6]. Furthermore, the a l-peak copper species have been confirmed to be the active center of the CuO/YSZ catalyst for CO oxidation [7]. However, when copper oxide was supported on the YSZ/y-alumina support, neither an c~l nor an c~2 peak was found in the TPR patterns as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d reveal that the y peak, which has been defined in our previous work [6] and ascribed to the reduction of bulk-like CuO, has split into two peaks, y~ and Y2. From above discussion, the following points should be mentioned: (1) The y~ and \"/2 peaks occur only in the case of higher copper loading; (2) The peak areas of yl and Y2 are roughly identical; and (3) The peak temperature of \"/2 is very close to that of Cu20 reduction [5,23,29]. We can infer from these points that the bulk-like copper oxide, which results in the generation of a y peak, has apparently exhibited a two-step reduction (i.e., Cu2+ ~ Cu+ ~ Cu owing to the YSZ/y-alumina support. On the other hand, reduction of isolated Cu2+ ions, as assigned to the fi-peak copper oxide species [6], seems to be less affected by the YSZ/y-alumina support. Wei-Pin Dow, T.-J.

Next, the two-step reduction of bulk-like copper oxide supported on YSZ/y- alumina was confirmed by performing the quasi-in situ XRD detection. When TPR had run to the valley between the Yl and \"/2 peak, the TPR cell was immediately cooled down and the sample was then immediately taken to run the XRD. Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d show the exact temperatures chosen for XRD run. The XRD patterns in Figs. 4 and 5 reveal that (a) only CuO peaks are observed for freshly calcined catalysts and (b) Cu20 is the only detectable copper oxide species for the TPR-interrupted samples.

These are shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 5c, respectively. Correspondingly, the inference mentioned above is confirmed. Bond et al. [18] and Rouco [30] pointed out that TPR of supported CuCI2, when is carried out, exhibits two-step reduction due to the chlorine ions. In our cases, XRD patterns indicate that copper(II) oxides are the only supported species on the freshly calcined catalysts as shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 5a. Nevertheless, the precursors of supported YSZ are chlorides. Hence, some residual chlorine species, of which the contents are too small to be detected by XRD, exist on the YSZ/y-alumina support although it had been calcined at 700 for 4 h. AgNO3 titration confirmed the existence of residual chlorine species. Therefore, we believe that the two-step reduction of YSZ/y-alumina supported copper oxide is also associated with the chlorine species. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b verify this occurrence. Fig. 3a shows a normal TPR pattern of chlorine-free 15 wt.% Cu/y-alumina catalyst, which has a strong resemblance to that of a previous work [6]. Fig. 3b shows the TPR pattern of 15 wt.% Cu/y-alumina catalyst of which the added amount of chlorine is 9.7 mol%. The feature and profile of the TPR curve shown in Fig. 3b are the same as those of Fig. 3c or Fig. 3d. This observation verifies the inference that the two-step reduction of the bulk-like copper oxide supported on YSZ/y-alumina is due to the effect of chlorine species. Notably, the added amount of chlorine ions is merely 9.7 mol% with respect to the copper content during impregnation. Furthermore, all HJCu ratios given in Fig. 3 are approximately equal to one. Hence, the possibility that the \"Y2 peak is due to the reduction of CuC1 can be ruled out. This correlates with the XRD results shown in Figs. 4 and 5, in which no XRD peak of bulk CuC1 was observed. Actually, chlorine content of the freshly calcined catalysts must be Wei-Pin Don,, T.-J.

Restated, it is suggested that one chlorine ion can induce a number of Cu20 (i.e., bulk Cu20) to be formed during TPR. Since the reduction of isolated Cu2+ ions is less affected by the chlorine addition, we can infer that the chlorine species should exist only in a specific configuration and environ- ment that is beneficial to the formation of bulk Cu20 during reduction. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, the /3-peak area of chlorine-free 15 wt.% Cu/y-alumina has a fraction of 16.6% with respect to the total peak area; meanwhile, that of the chlorine-containing one is 24.5%. This implies that a small number of chlorine ions can increase the amounts of highly dispersed copper oxide species, because the fl peak has been demonstrated to appear owing to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species [6]. This assumption was confirmed by preparing several 15 wt.% Cu/y-alumina cata- lysts with different added amounts of chlorine. Fig. 6 displays their TPR patterns. Indeed, the larger the amount of chlorine added implies the larger the area of /3 +/3' peaks, particularly if /3' peak can be observed. The area of the so-called y peak is generally decreased with the added amount of chlorine, implying that the added chlorine can help the supported copper oxide species to resist agglomeration and sintering during calcination and ultimately improve their dispersion. The XRD patterns in Fig. 7. confirm this assumption. Under the same copper loading, the higher the amount of chlorine added causes the weaker the XRD intensity, thereby implying that some copper oxides have become undetectable by XRD due to their particle size becoming small after the chlorine addition. A similar dispersion enhancement due to the chlorine addition has also been 26 Wei-Pin Dow, T.-J. Huang/Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 17-29 e ,6 d b a 20 30 40 50 60 70 20 Fig. 7.

Previous investigations have pointed out [11,12] that chlorine can be strongly bonded to the support and, then, the platinum oxide crystallites can interact with it to form oxychloroplatinum complexes such as PtOxC1 ;.. Once the complexes are formed, sintering does not easily occur. In our cases, only the bulk-like copper oxide can be induced by chlorine to exhibit the two-step reduction, whereas the isolated copper ions cannot. Hence. we believe that chlorine also prefers to remain in the cluster of copper oxide. Therefore, the isolated Cu2+ ions, which do not have a suffi- ciently large \"body\" to provide an adequate space for containing the chlorine, are less affected by the added chlorine. The chlorine located in the copper oxide cluster may be regarded as a dopant and therefore does not alter the lattice structure of copper oxide as demonstrated by XRD and shown in Fig. 4a, Fig. 5a and Fig. 7. Consequently, the /3'-peak formation in the TPR patterns of Fig. 6 can be reasonably attributed to the reduction of these chlorine-doped copper oxides, which are a highly dispersed species. Fig. 6 also shows that the higher the amount of chlorine added implies the lower the reducibility of the bulk-like copper oxide. When the added amount of chlorine is sufficiently high as shown in Fig. 6e, the two-step reduction behavior disappears and a y3-peak species is subsequently formed. To identify the 73-peak species, the quasi-in situ XRD detection was employed again. Fig. 6e and Fig. 8 show the exact temperatures chosen for the XRD runs and the TPR-interrupted XRD patterns, respectively. Those figures reveal that, whether 270 or 300 is chosen for TPR interruption, copper(II) oxide, instead of copper chloride, is the only detectable species. This suggests that the inhibitive extent in reduction of bulk-like copper oxide depends on the added amount of chlorine and that the added chlorine does not modify the lattice structure of bulk copper oxide although its added amount is high.

Added amount of chlorine, 30 mol%. Pretreatments: (a) TPR-interrupted; interrupted temperature, 270; (b) TPR-interrupted; interrupted tempera- ture, 300. (O) CuO. A few added chlorines leading to the reduction behavior of whole bulk-like copper oxide to be modified can be attributed to a \"long-range\" electronic effect of chlorine due to its strong electronegativity [16,17,31]. This effect is a through-space electrostatic interaction [32,33], thereby requiring a bulky \"body\" such as a cluster to act as a medium for dissemination. This finding corresponds to that in which chlorine should be doped into the copper oxide cluster as proposed above. From another perspective, these results also suggest that a small amount of chlorine can strengthen the bond strength between oxygen and copper. Restated, copper tends to lose its electrons owing to the effect of doping chlorine. A similar tendency of electron loss caused by the added chlorine was also found on noble metal catalysts [10-12,31]. Hence, it is conceivable that once the oxygen bonded to the copper which is shielded by the long-range electronic effect is removed by hydrogen, it should easily return. Restated, the reduced chlorine- containing Cu/y-alumina catalyst should be more easily reoxidized than the reduced chlorine-free one. TPO results as shown in Fig. 9 confirm this assump- tion. Indeed, TPO peaks of the reduced chlorine-containing Cu/y-alumina catalysts have markedly shifted toward lower temperatures than that of a chlorine-free one. Furthermore, the more residual chlorine causes the lower temperature of TPO peak. The assignment of different TPO peaks cannot be determined on the basis of current data. Further study is required to complete the identification. The enhancement of oxidizability of the reduced chlorine-contain- ing Cu/y-alumina catalysts may be associated with the acid strength of support because the acid strength of y-alumina can be increased by the addition of chlorine [34]. Strong acid is beneficial to the oxidation of metals. 28 Wei-Pin Dow, T.-J. Huang/Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 17-29 .d g 5O e d C b a 150 250 350 450 Temperature () Fig. 9.

Conclusion We can conclude the following on the basis of the results in this study. 1. Yttria-stabilized zirconia can be formed and supported on y-alumina using the co-impregnation method. However, the residual chlorine species resulting from the decomposition of the supported YSZ precursors cannot be easily removed by calcination, even at 700 for 10 h. Furthermore, after treatment with hydrogen at 500 for 5 h, chlorine still exists on the YSZ/y-alumina support [35]. This results in the disappearance of a1 and a2 peaks defined in our previous work [6] due to the surface oxygen vacancies of YSZ being blocked by the strongly adsorbed chlorine [7]. 2. A slight amount of residual chlorine can be doped into the bulk-like copper oxide, thereby leading to a two-step reduction due to a \"long-range\" electronic effect caused by the strong electronegativity of chlorine. This effect results in a strong tendency of electron loss of copper, ultimately leading to a significant enhancement in oxidizability of the reduced copper. 3. This work demonstrates that chlorine precursors are inadequate for synthesiz- ing the YSZ or YSZ/y-alumina support unless the residual chlorine can be completely removed. This is despite the fact that the residual chlorine can improve the dispersion of supported copper oxide. Nitrate precursor may be a promising alternative, but the solubility of zirconyl nitrate is very low. Hence, developing another series of oxygen-ion conducting oxides such as CeO2, ThO2, HfO2 and 6-Bi203 as supports should be a feasible approach. This work is currently underway [36].

Tel. (+886-35) 716260, fax. (+886-35) 717126. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was deposited on γ-alumina using a co-impregnation method and then copper oxide was supported on it. The CuO/YSZ/y-alumina catalysts were characterized by TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), TPO (temperature-programmed oxidation) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The bulk-like copper oxide can exhibit a two-step reduction (i.e., Cu2+ → Cu+ → Cu0), while isolated Cu2+ ions cannot. This has been attributed to a “long-range” electronic effect caused by the strong electronegativity of chlorine, which comes from the decomposition of the YSZ precursors. An experiment employing chlorine-containing CuO/γ-alumina catalysts, of which the chlorine content was controlled by adding HCl to the impregnating solution, has confirmed that the two-step reduction behavior is caused by the chlorine. In addition, it was found that the residual chlorine not only improves the dispersion of supported copper oxide but also enhances the oxidizability of the reduced copper.
