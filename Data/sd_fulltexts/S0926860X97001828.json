Introduction The hydrogenation of highly unsaturated hydrocar- bon is a process of considerable industrial importance in order to remove small concentrations of alkynes and alkadienes from streams comprising chiefly alkenes, either C2, C3 or C4. These products arise from con- version processes like steam-cracking or fluid cataly- tic cracking and virtually complete removal of alkynes and alkadienes is essential before the alkenes can be further processed by polymerization for instance [ 1,2]. Palladium is the most active and selective metal for these hydrogenation reactions. The high selectivity results from the fact that alkynes and alkadienes are both more strongly adsorbed than the corresponding alkenes and thus in a batch reactor no alkene will react *Corresponding author.

However, the very strong chemisorption of the reactant on the catalyst surface and particularly on atoms of low coordination number can lead to self- poisoning. Indeed, it was shown that hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene in the liquid phase on palladium cata- lysts is structure sensitive, the turnover frequency decreasing as dispersion is increased [3]. This effect was explained by the electron-deficient character of small Pd particles. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of iron on the catalytic properties of palladium for the hydrogenation of isoprene in the liquid phase. Indeed, various studies reported in the literature point out a promoting effect of this element on the activity or the selectivity of Pd and Pt hydrogenation catalysts [4-7]. Iron was introduced following different procedures in order to modify the interaction between the two 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Three methods were used: the coimpregnation or the successive impregnations of the metal precursor salts and a controlled surface reaction (CSR). 300, then outgassed at this temperature and cooled to room temperature. Metal accessibilities were obtained by the hydrogen chemisorption method at 7o [8]. 2. Experimental 2.3. Isoprene hydrogenation 2.1. Catalyst preparation A \"7-A1203 (Rh6ne-Poulenc SCS 69, surface area 60 m2/g) was used as catalyst support. Catalyst 1 (0.5wt% Pd/A1203; D=66%) was prepared by exchange of palladium acetylacetonate [Pd(CsHTO2)2] dissolved in toluene. After drying overnight in air at 120, catalyst 1 was calcined at 300 for 4 h and then reduced in hydrogen at 400 for 4 h. Catalyst 2 (0.5 wt% Pd/AI203; D=20%) was obtained by sinter- ing catalyst 1 under hydrogen for 4 h at 600. For the preparation of bimetallic catalysts by con- trolled surface reaction, the parent Pd/A1203 catalyst is introduced into a glass reactor where it is activated under hydrogen flow at 150. Then, a solution of formic acid, previously degassed under nitrogen flow, is introduced onto the catalyst at room temperature. Finally, the solution of Fe(NO3)3, dissolved in formic acid solution ([Fe3+]=10-4 M) and degassed under nitrogen, is introduced onto the catalyst. No iron hydroxide precipitation was observed under these reaction conditions. After a 15 min reaction time under hydrogen flow, the solution is eliminated by filtration and the catalyst is dried under nitrogen flow, then reduced under hydrogen at 150 for 2 h. Blank Pd/A1203 catalysts were prepared following the same procedure but without addition of the iron salt. Bimetallic catalysts were also prepared by co- impregnation of the precursor salts (Pd(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3) or successive impregnations of palladium and iron salts with an intermediary reduction step. Iron contents were determined by the ICP technique at the 'Service Central d'Analyses du CNRS'. 2.2. Metal accessibility Palladium accessibility was determined by volu- metric chemisorption in a conventional glass system equipped with a turbomolecular pump. The system is capable of a dynamic vacuum typically below 10-4 Pa. Prereduced samples were reduced again at Kinetic tests were carried out in the liquid phase in a 300 ml batch reactor (autoclave) at 2 MPa (20 bar) constant pressure. Isoprene (10 ml) was diluted in n- heptane (150 ml). The hydrogenation rate was foll- owed by recording the pressure drop in a constant volume hydrogen ballast, upstream of the pressure regulator, as a function of time. The temperature of the kinetic test and the catalyst weight were 25 and 0.250 g, respectively. Prereduced catalysts were either immersed into the solvent (n-heptane) without expo- sure to air before introduction into the autoclave or reduced again into the autoclave before introduction of the solvent. 3. Results Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the dif- ferent catalysts used in this study, their conditions of preparation and the metal accessibilities determined by hydrogen chemisorption. Catalysts 3-12 were obtained by the CSR method from the well dispersed parent monometallic catalyst (catalyst 1) while cata- lysts 13-18 were obtained by the same technique from the Pd/A1203 catalyst of low dispersion (catalyst 2). The amount of deposited iron by CSR is always lower than the amount of iron initially present in the solution (corresponding to a possible deposition of 3000 ppm on the solid) and it increases with both the pH and the accessibility of palladium. These evolu- tions tend to prove that iron deposition would occur by underpotential deposition (UPD) [9] since, by this technique, the submonolayer amount of iron must increase with the surface of palladium and with the pH (allowing the control of the reversible potential of hydrogen). Moreover, the treatment of the parent Pd/ A1203 catalysts following the same procedure but under nitrogen flow (blank catalysts) does not lead to a significant iron deposition, thus bearing out the prominent role of the supplementary Hz]H+ couple in the control of the potential of palladium particles.

Isoprene hydrogenation on monometallic catalysts In Fig. 1 is reported the isoprene conversion as a function of time for the hydrogenation of isoprene over the two Pd/A1203 catalysts with 20% and 66% metallic dispersion, respectively. Curves A and B show that isoprene is hydrogenated more quickly on low dispersion than on high dispersion catalysts. This conclusion is more obvious when the activity is expressed as turnover (moles of isoprene converted per atom of palladium exposed per second) using the initial slopes of the curves. Indeed, Fig. 2 shows that the turnover of the different monometallic Pd/A1203 catalysts used in this work decreases monotonously as palladium dispersion increases. On the other hand, the product distribution during the reaction was similar for the different catalysts in accordance with previous work [3]. For example, at 20 min reaction time the feed composition is close to 20% 2-methyl 1-butene, 10% 3-methyl 1-butene, 60% 2-methyl 2-butene and 10% isopentane. Moreover, isopentane production was not observed at the begin- ning of the reaction which allowed to determine the initial rate from hydrogen consumption assuming one hydrogen molecule consumed per isoprene molecule. 3.2. Isoprene hydrogenation on Pd/AleO~ catalysts prepared by controlled surface reaction First we examined the influence of the activation procedure on the activity of bimetallic catalysts pre- pared by controlled surface reaction. After deposition of iron, drying under nitrogen and reduction under hydrogen at 150 into the preparation apparatus, the catalyst is either immersed in n-heptane without expo- sure to ambient air (in situ reduction) or exposed to air and reduced again into the hydrogenation reactor 316 R.

As is seen in Fig. 3, the activity of the bimetallic catalyst depends strongly on the activa- tion procedure (Fig. 3(a)) while that of the blank monometallic one is not affected (Fig. 3(b)). Indeed, iron enhances isoprene hydrogenation when the bi- metallic catalyst is not exposed to an oxidizing atmo- sphere while that promoting effect of iron is not observed on the catalyst exposed to air and reduced at 150 into the hydrogenation reactor. This difference could result from the effect of having a bimetallic catalyst not completely reduced after exposure to air and reduction under hydrogen at 150. Indeed, it was noticed in a previous work that bimetallic Pd-Fe/A1203 catalysts prepared by this technique consumed hydrogen until 200 in the course of TPR studies. In order to discuss this hypoth- esis, the bimetallic catalyst was reduced into the autoclave at 300 before isoprene hydrogenation. The results reported in Fig. 3(a) show that the pro- moting effect of iron is lost after exposure to air whatever the temperature of the subsequent reduction. Consequently, hydrogenation experiments were per- formed on bimetallic catalysts which were not exposed to air during the transfer from the preparation apparatus to the test apparatus (in situ reduction mode). Otherwise, the activity of the parent Pd/ A1203 catalyst (D=66%) submitted to nitrogen bub- bling in the acid medium at pH=3.7 in the presence of ferric nitrates is similar to that of the blank after in situ reduction (Fig. 4). As such treatment does not lead to iron deposit, this result shows that the deposition of iron on the parent catalyst is necessary to increase the rate of palladium for isoprene hydrogenation and that the only contact of the catalyst with ferric nitrates is not sufficient to improve its hydrogenating activity. The various bimetallic Pd-Fe/A1203 catalysts pre- pared by controlled surface reaction from the well dispersed monometallic Pd/A1203 catalyst (D=66%) were submitted to the reaction of isoprene hydrogena- tion after in situ reduction under hydrogen at 150. In Fig. 5 is plotted the rate of hydrogenation of isoprene (in moles of isoprene hydrogenated per second per gram of palladium) as a function of the pH of the acid medium used for the iron deposition by controlled surface reaction. The activities of the blank Pd/A1203 catalysts obtained following the same procedure but without addition of iron are also reported.

How- ever, the activity goes through a maximum as a function of the pH and therefore as a function of the iron content. On the other hand, no promoting effect of iron is observed on bimetallic catalysts prepared by controlled surface reaction from a parent Pd/A1203 catalyst of low dispersion (Table 2). Indeed, the activity of the bimetallic Pd-Fe/A1203 catalyst is quite similar to that of the corresponding blank Pd/ A1203 catalyst. Otherwise, iron addition does not modify the product distribution on the different cata- lysts. 3.3. Activity of bimetallic catalysts prepared by various methods The purpose of this study is to compare the activity for isoprene hydrogenation of catalysts prepared by controlled surface reaction and by more classical methods such as the coimpregnation or the successive impregnations of the metal precursor salts. The cata- lysts prepared by these two last procedures are activated either by direct reduction or by calcina- tion-reduction (Table 1) and then reduced again under hydrogen at 150 before the test-reaction ('in situ' reduction). The curves reported in Figs. 6 and 7 reveal that catalysts prepared by coimpregnation are less Table 2 Effect of iron addition by CSR on the activity of the low dispersion parent catalyst (D=20%) for isoprene hydrogenation pH of preparation Activity (mol g-lPd s 1) Blank Pd/AI203 Pd-Fe/A1203 2.0 0.128 0.140 3.7 0.114 0.101 5.0 0.114 0.109 320 R.

Moreover, the lowest activity is observed on the bimetallic catalysts initially activated by calcination-reduction, this result being more obvious for the highest iron content (2300 ppm). Likewise, iron added by the technique of successive impregnations on a mono- metallic Pd/A1203 catalyst activated by calcination- reduction at 300, does not promote the activity of palladium for isoprene hydrogenation (Fig. 8). On the contrary, the addition of 0.06 wt% iron inhibits strongly the activity of the parent catalyst. Therefore, for similar iron contents, the bimetallic catalyst prepared by successive impregnations is far less active than the bimetallic one prepared by controlled surface reaction. A sample of the bimetallic catalyst prepared by successive impregnations was submitted to hydrogen bubbling in formic acid medium at pH=3.7 and reduced under hydrogen at 150 before the hydro- genation reaction ('in situ' reduction). This experi- ment was carried out in order to see if the treatment under the operating conditions of the deposition of iron by controlled surface reaction (but without ferric nitrates) is able to induce a restructuration of the bimetallic catalyst leading to a promoting effect of iron. The result reported in Fig. 8 shows that such treatment does not improve the activity of the catalyst prepared by successive impregnations. 4. Discussion-conclusion The higher activity observed for isoprene hydro- genation on large palladium particles is in agreement with previous studies on the hydrogenation of alka- dienes and alkynes [3]. The authors explain this particle size effect by the electron-deficient character of small particles and by a too strong complexation of the highly unsaturated hydrocarbons which are elec- tron donors. 322 R. Bachir et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 313-322 The results of isoprene hydrogenation on Pd-Fe/ A1203 catalysts show that the effects induced by iron on palladium activity depend on the procedure used for the preparation of bimetallic catalysts. Indeed, iron added by controlled surface reaction promotes more or less the activity of palladium particles while the opposite effect is observed when iron is introduced by coimpregnation or successive impregnations. As the promoting effect of iron appears only on bimetallic catalyst prepared by CSR from a well dispersed parent catalyst we may believe that this behaviour is the result of an electron transfer from iron to palladium. Thus, by a 'ligand effect', iron would decrease the complexation strength of isoprene on palladium and consequently would enhance the activity of small palladium particles. Otherwise this promoting effect of iron is lost after oxidation and subsequent reduction. This phenom- enon, which results probably from a modification of the bimetallic catalyst surface, leads to catalytic prop- erties similar to that of the coimpregnated catalysts with a comparable iron content (catalysts 19 and 20). Two reasons could be invoked to explain this result. The first one could be that upon oxidation iron oxide moves away from the Pd particles to the alumina. Upon subsequent reduction it would then be difficult for the iron ions to become reduced to iron atoms and return to the Pd surface. Another explanation could be the diffusion of a part of iron adatoms into palladium bulk, leading to alloy formation as it has been reported in the literature [10-12]. However Edge and EXAFS experiments on Pt-Fe alloys have indicated that there was an electron transfer from iron to platinum [4]. The same conclusion was put forward from a theoretical study with an increased electron density on the surface Pt atoms of a PtsoFe2o (1 1 1) alloy [13]. If we assume the same electron transfer between iron and palladium in Pd-Fe alloys, the addition of small amounts of iron to palladium ought to increase the activity of palla- dium particles. Such effect is not observed on bi- metallic catalysts prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnations. In conclusion, the promot- ing effect of iron introduced by CSR may result from an electron transfer between iron and palladium, but an electron effect does not seem sufficient to promote palladium activity. Indeed, the catalytic properties of the Pd-Fe catalyst depend also on the nature of the interaction between the two metals and on the surface structure of the metallic phase. Iron introduced by CSR would be deposited on the surface of palladium particles while coimpregnated catalysts would lead to alloy formation with a strong Pd surface segregation [14,15]. The deposition of iron adatoms on small palladium particles promotes the activity of palladium for isoprene hydrogenation while this effect is not observed when the two metals would be alloyed.

Fax: 33-49 45 34 99. Isoprene hydrogenation was investigated on PdFe/alumina catalysts in the liquid phase. Iron added by a controlled surface reaction (CSR) promotes the activity of small palladium particles while the opposite effect is generally observed on catalysts prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnations of the metal precursor salts. Iron introduced by CSR would be deposited on the surface of palladium particles while the other preparation techniques would lead to alloy formation.
