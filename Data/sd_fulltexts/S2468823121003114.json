In this study, novel Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 catalyst is synthesized via a one-step electrodeposition process, with the heterojunction having excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. There is a strong electronic interaction between the Ni and NiS x , which resulted in fast charge transfer ability and hydrogen release ability for hydrogen evolution process. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 catalyst has ultralow overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm−2. In addition, a Tafel slopes of 34.31 mV dec−1 indicates that the catalytic performance of the catalyst for the HER via the Volmer – Heyrovsky mechanism. The catalyst also exhibits excellent continuous electrocatalytic stability. These key performance parameters are comparable to the commercial platinum carbon catalyst, owing to the synergistic enhancement effect of heterojunction and the strong adhesion of the catalyst to the substrate by electrodeposition. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Transition non-noble metal Heterojunction Electrodeposition Hydrogen evolution reaction Electrocatalysis 1 Introduction With the increasing global energy consumption, people have searching for new energy resources to replace the traditional fossil energy, such as hydrogen, water and solar energy [1, 2]. Hydrogen has attracted considerable attention because of its high specific energy and lack of pollution [3, 4]. Hydrogen production via natural gas reforming, light and electrolytic water have been successively developed [5]. At present, a catalyst has been used to promote the electrolysis of water, which is one of the most effective ways to produce hydrogen energy [6, 7]. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), noble metals (Pt–based) has been widely used in industrial production, but there are certain disadvantages such as high manufacturing cost and poor durability [8]. It is inevitable to find cheap and non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the development and utilization of HER. Unfortunately, this goal is still a huge challenge and requires more efforts. However, many recent researches have reported numerous transitional non-precious metal materials including carbides (e.g., Mo2C) [9, 10], phosphides (e.g., WP2) [11, 12, 13, 14], nitrides (e.g., Cu1Ni2 N) [15, 16], and chalcogenides [17, 18] for HER. In contrast, the ingenious design of these materials improved the economic benefits of the materials to a certain extent and increased the sustained high catalytic activity. In short, the performance of catalyst may be improved and optimized by selecting compounds with different atomic composition and controlling the ratio of different atoms [11]. However, further research is needed for industrialization. In order to improve the catalytic ability of catalyst materials, it is necessary to consider factors such as conductivity, morphology controls [19,20] and intrinsic catalytic activity [21, 22, 23]. Importantly, transition metal sulfur compounds have unique electronic structure and physical and chemical properties. NiS x has certain properties of metal because its whole crystal structure framework contains continuous network of Ni–Ni bonds [23]. Therefore, it has good conductivity. Moreover, recent reports have revealed that heterojunction structure can improve the performance of the catalyst. For example, Li et al. reported that N, B co-doped nickel phosphide nanoparticles/graphene exhibited a strong synergy between heterojunctions, which resulted in the optimized hydrogen adsorption and water free energy [24]; Qi et al. presented a (MoO2–CeF3/NF) heterojunction nanosheet, which improved the durability of the catalyst [25]; Huang et al. reported an atomic-level heterostructure (MoS2QDs@Mo2C@NF) and suggested that the heterojunction interface has low contact resistance [26]. The density and the activity of the active center determine the inherent catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst [27, 28, 29]. Interestingly, the heterojunction can effectively change not only the electron distribution of the catalyst producing sufficiently strong interfacial polarization, but also the full exposure of the catalytic active sites. More importantly, recent theoretical research [30, 31] shows that the Ni/NiS x heterojunction has adequate adsorption and desorption energy ratio for HER, which attributed to the weakening of Ni–H and the promotion of the breakage of the hydrogen-oxygen bond in water [32]. Therefore, this synergistic effect improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Ni/NiS x system. Herein, we report for the first time that a coralline-stacked Ni/NiS x heterojunction electrocatalyst for HER loaded on foamed nickel (NF) can be synthesized quickly and efficiently via one-step constant-voltage electrodeposition. The preparation of self-supporting electrodes by electrodeposition can increase the contact between the catalytic material and the electrolyte solution, and improve the adhesion of the material. In order to improve the conductivity of the material, we use NF as the supporting electrode. For the morphological controls, the sedimentary layer has abundant cracks and coral-like protrusions so that the catalytically active layer is fully exposed. In addition, the synergistic enhancement effect of the heterojunction can also further enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of the material. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals Nickel foam and Carbon paper (Cyber Electrochemical Materials Network), NiCl6•6H2O (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, China), CH4N2S (Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology Co., Ltd.), C6H5O7Na3•2H2O (Tianjin, China Komiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), KOH (China Tianjin Yuanli Chemical Co., Ltd.). All reagents are analytically pure and can be used directly without further purification. 2.2 Electrodeposition synthesis of Ni/NiS x @NF Cleaning foam nickel: To remove oxide and oil stains on the surface, a NF (approximately 1 cm × 2 cm × 2 mm) was continuously ultrasonized in ethanol, 3 M HCl solution and deionized water (20 min per step). Subsequently, the NF was cleaned in a vacuum dried oven and dry at 60 °C for 6 h. Deposition process: In the deposition process, three-electrode system was used on CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. NF (deposition area of 1.0 cm2), saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum sheet were used as working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Approximately 50 mL electrolyte contains 0.12 M NiCl6•6H2O, 0.30 M C6H5O7Na3 (Na3Cit), and different concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M) of CH4N2S,which denoted as Ni/NiS x @NF-0, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8, and Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, respectively. The deposition voltage, deposition time and stirring speed were −1.5 V, 80 min, and 300 rpm, respectively. Some experimental conditions have been optimized. (see Tab. S1–3 and Fig. S1) Simultaneously, Ni/NiS x @CP-0.8, NiS x @NF and Pt/C@NF were used as control sample. (see supplementary materials for detailed preparation methods) 2.3 Physical characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected via a diffractometer (D8 advance, Brooke, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra was studied by laser Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, invia reflex). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, s4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 200 kV, jem-2100f, Britain) were used to observe the surface morphology of the materials. Additionally, X-ray spectrometer (EDS) was used for elementical analysis of the nanomaterials on a jem-2100f. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the valence distribution of elements by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (15 kV, 10 mA, axis supra, Kratos, Britain). Amorphous carbon (284.8 eV) was used for binding energy correction. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization All the tests and characterization were carried out at 25 °C. Ni/NiS x @NF (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm), carbon rod electrode, and SCE were used as working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively. Before measuring the polarization curve, the catalyst was pre-activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at 50 mV s − 1, and then the linear voltammetric polarization curve (LSV, test range: 0 to −0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), scanning rate: 1 mV s − 1) was recorded and analyzed to evaluate the catalytic activity for HER, and then corrected by iR compensation. All measured potentials were calibrated using the Nernst equation relative to RHE (E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.0591 × pH + 0.2415). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at −1.1 V in the frequency range of 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. CV was used to evaluate electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) of the prepared catalyst was calculated. In addition, the stability test was carried out by obtaining multiple current density steps and chronopotentiometric curve of 100 mA cm−2. In this paper, only the LSV curve and Tafel slope were adjusted for iR. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Deposition principle When the current density is applied to the electrodes in the salt solution, H + is reduced to H2 on the surface of the nickel foam, and the produced H2 cannot desorb from the metal surface owing to the surface tension. This discontinuous deposition forms a deposit layer, such as dendritic, coral and foam, on the electrode material surface. The following chemical reactions occur during the electrochemical deposition process: (1) C H 4 N 2 S + 2 e → C N − + N H 4 + + S 2 − (2) N i 2 + + C i t 3 − → N i C i t − (3) N i C i t − + 2 e → N i + C i t 3 − (4) N i C i t − + x S 2 − → N i S x + C i t 3 − Under the same potential, the driving potential of reaction (3) is lower than reaction (4) [33]. When the constant deposition voltage is −1.5 V, Ni2+is preferentially deposited on the Ni foam surface to form nanoscale nickel particles. Subsequently, amorphous NiS x is deposited on the surface of single-crystal Ni, and finally forms Ni/NiS x heterojunction. In addition, we use the CV cycle test to further analyze the deposition mechanism. It can be clearly observed in Fig. 1 that the initial deposition potential of Ni in the first cycle is approximately −0.45 V. With the progress of the deposition process, the initial deposition potential of Ni shifted and the cathode current density gradually decreased. This may be because the decomposition of thiourea in the solution produces a large amount of S2−(Reaction (1)), which inhibits the reduction of Ni [34, 35] and produces amorphous NiS x . This difference in deposition order leads to the formation of heterojunction. 3.2 Characterization of morphology and structure Fig. 2 was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which illustrates the surface morphology of different catalysts. It can be seen that there are significant differences in the depositional morphology under different preparation conditions. When there is no thiourea, the arrangement of the deposited layer is compact without cracks (Fig. 2b). However, as the concentration of thiourea increases, cracks in the sedimentary layer gradually expand and produce a large number of coral-like protrusions (approximately 100 nm) (Fig. 2c–d). Numerous faults and crack may be attributed to the formation of a large number of bubbles and the difference in internal stress of Ni and NiS x during the progress of the electrochemical deposition [36, 37]. However, the appropriate coral structure and faults considerably increase the specific surface area of the catalyst, enlarge the contact area with water, and finally accelerate the process of HER [38, 39]. Fig. 2f illustrates the diffraction peaks of all catalyst correspond well with the standard PDF#04–0850 (Ni) and previous reports [31]. However, there are no characteristic peaks related to NiS x , implying that NiS x is amorphous. In order to eliminate the influence of foamed-nickel substrate on the characterization results, a comparative analysis of the deposition on carbon paper (Ni/NiS x @CP-0.8) found that the peak position has not changed. Notably, the catalytic activity of NiS x decreases with increasing crystallinity [40, 41]. Compared with NiS x with good crystallinity, amorphous morphology can expose more active edges [42] and exhibit improved stability [43, 44, 45], which resulted in the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity. The ultrasonically treated powders from Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 were characterized via TEM. Fig. 3 a clearly shows that nickel crystal particles (approximately 10 nm) are uniformly distributed in the whole plane. Fig. 3b illustrates that the lattice spacing is approximately 0.206 nm, which can be classified as the (111) crystal plane of crystal Ni (PDF#04–0850) [30]. However, lattice fringe related to NiS x were absent, indicating that NiS x is amorphous. This conclusion is consistent with the previous XRD conclusions. In addition, Fig. 3b also demonstrate that the Ni nanoparticles are wrapped by numerous amorphous NiS x , resulting in the formation of a large number of grain boundaries. In addition, it can be seen that Ni and S are distributed over the entire plane via the elemental composition analysis by EDS (Fig. 3c–f and Fig. S2). The elemental composition of the catalyst surface was analyzed by XPS (Fig. 4 ). Here it can clearly be observed that spin-orbit double peaks and their satellite peaks appears in the deconvoluted Ni 2p profiles in different catalysis. The spin-orbit double peaks at 855.5 and 873.3 eV are derived from Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni2+, as well as their satellite peaks at 860.8 and 879.6 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4,Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 and Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2 also display two peak of Ni–S bond at 852.9 and 869.5 eV [46], which is red-shifted by 1.0 eV relative to the peak of NiS x @NF (853.9 and 870.5 eV, respectively) [47]. This means that there is a strong interaction between Ni and NiS x , which causes electrons to be transferred at their interface. We also noticed that the position of the Ni-S bond of the catalysts with different sulfur content did not change. It can be shows that the synergistic effect may not be the only factor that affects the performance of the catalyst. The content of Ni and NiS x may be another factor. For HER, Ni and NiS x in the Ni/NiS x heterojunction act as proton acceptors and hydride acceptors, respectively. The proper ratio of Ni and NiS x is crucial for the dissociation of water and the release of hydrogen. The binding energy (BE) peak at 852.2 eV can be assigned to Ni0 [48]. Moreover, the 2p spectrum of S (Fig. 4b) also show the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peak at 161.8 and 162.9 eV, which is consistent with the previously report [49]. The peak at 168.3 eV is attributed to the partial oxidation of surface S by O2 in the air. 3.3 HER catalytic performances The electrocatalytic performance of HER catalysts were detected by a typical three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution. As expected, bare-NF, Ni/NiS x @NF-0, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4, Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, and NiS x @NF exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance, whereas the performance of the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 catalyst is comparable to commercial Pt/C. Specifically, Fig. 5 a shows that Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 has the best electrocatalytic activity, and overpotential is 42 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER, whereas bare-NF, Ni/NiS x @NF-0, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4, Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, NiS x @NF, and Pt/C@NF requires 227, 228, 65, 51, 214, and 35 mV, respectively. Compared to Ni/NiS x @NF-0 and NiS x @NF, the excellent catalytic performance of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 verifies the synergy between Ni and NiS x [24]. Exactly, the synergy is mainly manifested in accelerating the rate of charge transfer and hydrogen release for HER [50]. More importantly, compared to Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4 and Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, appropriate microstructure also contributes to the improvement of catalytic performance, which was attributed to number of active centers and full exposure of the active center [51]. In addition, the corresponding overpotentials of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 are 54, 74, and 91 mV at 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. However, compared to Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8, bare-NF, Ni/NiS x @NF-0, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4, Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, NiS x @NF, and Pt/C@NF requires a higher overpotential to achieve the corresponding current density (see Fig. S4 for details), indicating that Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 has better catalytic activity at high current density and meets the needs of industry. Evidently, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 has been superior than most of the non-precious metal catalysts that have been reported (Table S4), implying that the heterojunction structure formed by Ni and NiS x has a very strong synergistic effect compared with the single-component structure [52]. Tafel slopes (Fig. 5b) obtained by linear fitting of the LSV curve further demonstrated the catalytic mechanism for HER. As expected, the Tafel slopes of bare NF, Ni/NiS x @NF-0, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.4, Ni/NiS x @NF-1.2, NiS x @NF, and Pt/C@NF are 182.3, 158.6, 76.68, 46.13, 127.3, and 52.2 mV dec−1, respectively. However, Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 has a ultrasmall Tafel slopes of 34.31 mV dec−1, indicating that the Ni/NiS heterojunction leads to reaction to proceed with a more favorable mechanism (Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism) [53]. In alkaline medium, it is generally considered that the HER reaction consists of two steps: (1) Volmer reaction: H2O+e −→H*+OH−(Tafel slopes 118 mV dec−1); (2) Heyrovsky reaction: H*+H2O+e −→H2+OH− or the Tafel reaction: 2H*→ H2 +2*(Tafel slopes 40 or 30 mV dec−1). The decrease in the Tafel slopes of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 proves that the Volmer reaction rate is accelerated. The possible reason is that the change of the electron density around the catalyst atoms improves the ability of the catalyst to bond with the hydrogen atoms, thereby accelerating the Volmer reaction for HER. Specifically, the chemical synergistic effect of Ni/NiS x heterojunction optimizes the bond energy of the nickel-hydrogen bond formed by single crystal Ni and hydrogen atoms and the adsorption of NiS x for OH, which reach a lowered barrier for H2O splitting [30, 54]. In addition, the coral-structure and faults also improve the contact between water and the active center of the catalyst and facilitate mass transfer [55, 56]. It can be seen that the Cdl (281.4 mF cm−2) of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 is considerably higher than the other catalysts (Fig. 5c), implying that the heterojunction and coral-like structure can increase and more effectively expose the active sites [57]. In addition, Fig. 5d illustrates that Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 has the smallest semicircular diameter, indicating that it has the smallest charge transfer resistance (6.721 Ω) compared to other catalysts. Ultra-low resistance means excellent electrochemical conductivity and faster charge transfer process for HER [58], which was also proved by the Tafel slopes results (Fig. 5b). More importantly, the existence of the heterogeneous grain boundary induces a Coulomb potential gradient near the grain boundary, which promotes the efficient transfer of electrons at the interface [30, 31], thereby accelerating the rate of the reaction. It is essential to excellent charge transfer ability and suitable adsorption and desorption ability for excellent catalyst. Interestingly, the existing data (Fig. 5e) reveal that the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 not only has a suitable adsorption and desorption for hydrogen atom, but also shows excellent charge transfer capacity. The main reasons for the excellent catalytic performance of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 are as follows: Firstly, the protrusions and cracks of the deposited layer enhance the contact between the active points of the catalyst and water [59], and promote the hydrogen release process for HER. Secondly, the synergy of the Ni/NiS x heterojunction changes and improves the state of the surrounding electrons of atom. Therefore, the number of active sites and the degree of activity of the catalyst are increased. In addition, the interface between the high-conductivity matrix and the synergy of the Ni/NiS x heterojunction facilitates rapid charge transfer for HER, thus it has extremely low electrochemical reaction resistance. Fig. 6 a shows that the trend of the correlation curve between the overpotential and time. There was a satisfactory change in the catalytic performance during the entire process, implying that the developed electrocatalytic material has exceptional persistent catalytic activity. After 3000 cycles of CV testing, it can be seen that the overall overpotential changed little (Fig. 6b). The long-term stability of Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 can be attributed to excellent adhesion between surface active material and the substrate and stability of catalyst components. 4 4.Conclusions In this study, the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 electrocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a simple electrodeposition method. The catalyst has extremely small overpotential of 42 mV (10 mA cm−2), Tafel slope of 34.31 mV dec−1, and excellent catalytic stability in alkaline environments for HER. The high catalytic activity might be due to the following reasons. Firstly, the coral-like structure and crack can expose more active sites and facilitate the release of hydrogen, which promotes the progress of the HER. Secondly, the highly conductive nickel and interfacial electric field between Ni/NiS x heterojunction promote the rapid transfer of charges and accelerate the reaction process for HER. Thirdly, the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 prepared by electrodeposition is firmly combined with the substrate, so it has a longer-lasting excellent catalytic activity. More importantly, compared with some traditional methods, the remarkable advantages such as low energy consumption and rapid efficiency of the electrodeposition provide the possibility for industrialization applications.

        "dc:description": "In this study, novel Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 catalyst is synthesized via a one-step electrodeposition process, with the heterojunction having excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. There is a strong electronic interaction between the Ni and NiS x , which resulted in fast charge transfer ability and hydrogen release ability for hydrogen evolution process. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the Ni/NiS x @NF-0.8 catalyst has ultralow overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm−2. In addition, a Tafel slopes of 34.31 mV dec−1 indicates that the catalytic performance of the catalyst for the HER via the Volmer – Heyrovsky mechanism. The catalyst also exhibits excellent continuous electrocatalytic stability. These key performance parameters are comparable to the commercial platinum carbon catalyst, owing to the synergistic enhancement effect of heterojunction and the strong adhesion of the catalyst to the substrate by electrodeposition.",
