The results directly showed that the catalyst was first reduced and then oxidized. The rate-determining step was the adsorption and activation of propane on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst. Propane and oxygen were adsorbed on dif- ferent sites of the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst. Key words: propane; propene; vanadium and magnesium oxide catalyst; oxygen activity; solid electrolyte potentiometry � Propene is an important chemical that can be used to produce polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, etc. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene is being intensively investigated to produce olefins. The ODP reaction is an exothermic process favored by thermodynamics. Compared with the traditional cracking dehydrogenation reac- tion used in industry, the ODP process has the advantages of low energy consumption, low temperature, less coke deposi- tion, and no equilibrium limitation [1–3]. However, due to the high reactivity of product, the selectivity for propene is usually low. ODP is a promising alternative process to produce pro- pene, but it is also a challenging process for catalytic chemists. Many efficient catalysts have been explored, and the structure and the active sites of the catalysts were studied in detail. Among these catalysts, the V-Mg-O catalyst system is one of the most important catalyst systems [4]. In this paper, periodic oscillations of oxygen activity on a Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated by solid electrolyte potentiometry (SEP). SEP is a technique in which the oxygen activity ( Z O 2 ) of a catalyst is monitored in situ by measuring the electromotive force (emf) of a solid state electrochemical cell [5–7]. The measurement of the activity of oxygen species under reaction conditions has proved to be very useful for understanding the reaction mechanism. This method uses a galvanic cell to monitor the oxygen activity on the catalyst. The cell typically consists of a 8% Y 2 O 3 -doped ZrO 2 (YSZ) membrane that separates the reference and reaction compartments. The cata- lyst is deposited on the electrolyte in the form of a porous electrode film as the measuring electrode, and a porous Pt electrode is deposited on the other side of the electrolyte as the reference electrode. When the catalyst is exposed to a mixture of oxygen and inert gas and the reference Pt electrode is ex- posed to air respectively, the potential difference � E under an open circuit condition can be calculated by the Nernst equation � E = RTln(P O2m /P O2r )/4F, where � E is the electromotive force of the cell, P O2m is the oxygen pressure of measuring side, P O2r is the oxygen pressure of the reference side, and R, T, and F are the ideal gas constant, temperature, and Faraday constant, respectively. Under this condition, the oxygen activity on the catalyst electrode is the same as the oxygen pressure, Z O 2 = P O2m . When the measuring catalyst electrode is exposed to a mixture of propane and oxygen, the catalyst is reduced and the oxygen activity on the catalyst electrode is the same or less than the oxygen pressure, Z O 2 � P O2m . The potential difference � E under the open circuit condition is given by � E = RTln( Z O 2 /P O2r )/4F. The solid state electrochemical cell comprises the following: air, Pt/YSZ/Mg 2 V 2 O 7 , C 3 H 8 , O 2 , and He. Air (P O2 = 20.28 kPa) was fed to the reference Pt electrode at a flow rate of 50 JI Baofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(5): 375–377 ml/min. A mixture made of C 3 H 8 , O 2 , and He was fed to the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 electrode at a total flow rate of 50 ml/min. The Mg 2 V 2 O 7 was prepared by the wetness impregnation method in which the Mg(OH) 2 material was added to a hot aqueous NH 4 VO 3 solution. The suspension was evaporated and dried overnight at 120 o C. The resulting solid was crushed and cal- cined at 550 and 800 o C for 6 h, respectively [4]. Then, a mixture with a weight ratio of Mg 2 V 2 O 7 :terpineol:glycol = 2:1:1 was pasted onto one side of the YSZ membrane with thickness of 1 mm. The resulting pellet was calcined at 450 o C for 10 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 5 o C/min. The weight of loaded Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst was 28 mg. Platinum paste was brushed onto the other side of the YSZ pellet, which was then treated at 450 o C for 10 h. The weight of loaded Pt was 30 mg. The areas of the electrodes were both 0.75 cm 2 . The obtained YSZ pellet with the electrodes was sealed onto a dense Al 2 O 3 tube using a ceramic sealing. Gold grids were pressed onto the two electrodes and connected with the multimeter by gold wires. The emf of the cell was monitored by a Keithley 2000 multimeter. Reaction products from the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 electrode were determined by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890). In this work, the conversion of propane was under 0.5% and the temperature variation of the cell was less than 0.2 o C. In general, two mechanisms were proposed for the ODP reaction. One is a free radical type of reaction [8] and the other is the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, which is also called the redox mechanism [9,10]. The redox mechanism includes a series of consecutive steps. In these steps, the two most im- portant steps are the reduction of the catalyst by propane and then the reduced catalyst is oxidized by oxygen. Fig. 1 shows the variation of oxygen activity on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst under reaction conditions at 500 o C. In Fig. 1, the oxygen activity on Mg 2 V 2 O 7 that was exposed to air was steady and almost the same as the oxygen activity in air. However, periodic oscillations of oxygen activity on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst were observed when the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 was placed under reaction conditions (propane/oxygen/helium). The oxygen activity on Mg 2 V 2 O 7 decreased suddenly and then increased back to the initial value. This process shows the redox process of Mg 2 V 2 O 7 during the ODP reaction. A com- plete redox period includes the adsorption and activation of propane and oxygen, and then the reduction of the catalyst by propane and oxidization by oxygen in succession. Helium was used to adjust the total flow rate of the reactant to 50 ml/min when adjusting the ratio of propane and oxygen to 8%:8%, 8%:4%, and 8%:2%. The oscillation period of oxygen activity was 2.4 s, and this did not change with the propane/oxygen ratio, as shown in Fig. 1. In this period, the adsorption and activation of propane needed 2 s, and the consequent reduction and oxidization processes only required 0.4 s. Therefore, the rate-determining step of the ODP reaction on Mg 2 V 2 O 7 is the adsorption and activation of propane, which is approved by the literature [11–14]. According to the literature [13–15], the rate of propene formation is first order in propane and zero order in oxygen, and gaseous oxygen does not take part directly in the ODP reaction. The oxygen activity on Mg 2 V 2 O 7 in the adsorp- tion and activation process was 8.21 kPa in propane/oxygen = 8%:8%, 3.85 kPa in propane/oxygen = 8%:4%, and 2.23 kPa in propane/oxygen = 8%:2%. It is clear that during the adsorption and activation processes, the oxygen activities of Mg 2 V 2 O 7 were almost the same as that of the reactants. The adsorption and activation of propane did not affect the oxygen activity of the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst until the activated propane was oxidized to propene. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that propane and oxygen were adsorbed on different active sites on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst and the adsorbed propane did not react with gaseous oxygen. Table 1 lists the catalytic results of the ODP reaction on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst at 500 o C. As shown in the table, the con- version of propane increased with the oxygen concentration and the selectivity for propene followed the reversed trend. Kinetics studies have shown that the combustion of propane is first order in propane and 0.5 order in oxygen [13,14]. With increased oxygen concentration, CO 2 selectivity for increased. Baldi et al. [15] reported that the rate of ODP reaction was 5–6 times faster than the rate of propane combustion. They sug- 02468101214161820 1E-3 0.01 0.1 2.0 s2.4 s (4) D 2 Time (s) (1) (2) (3) Fig. 1.

JI Baofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(5): 375–377 gested that CO 2 and CO are the products of further oxidizing the intermediate products or propene. However, Pantazidis et al. [16] suggested that the ODP reaction and the combustion reaction occur on different active sites. Because the ODP re- action is much faster than the combustion of propane, if the two reactions occur on different active sites, there should be two different oxygen activity oscillations. This is not consistent with that only one oxygen activity oscillation was observed. Therefore, CO x was the product of the consecutive oxidation of the intermediate product or propene. The control of the further oxidization of the intermediate product or propene is important to improve the selectivity for propene. The redox ability of the catalyst affects the reaction activity significantly and influences the distribution of the products. The ODP reaction is a very complicated process and the mechanism is not yet clear. In this work, we tried to understand this process by the in situ monitoring of the oxygen activity of the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst. The results showed that the redox mechanism was the dominant mechanism of the ODP reaction on the Mg 2 V 2 O 7 catalyst at 500 o C and propane and oxygen were adsorbed on different active sites. The oscillation period directly showed that the rate-determining step was the adsorp- tion of propane. References 1 Capannelli G, Carosini E, Cavani F, Monticelli O, Trifiro F.
