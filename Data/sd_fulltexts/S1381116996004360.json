Rooney School of Chemistry, Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland BT9 SAG, Ireland Received 19 June 1996; accepted 16 October 1996 Abstract The hydrogenolysis of neopentyl iodide on reduced Co or Pt dispersed on Mg0 support yields increasing amounts of 2-metylbutane and 2-methylbutenes in addition to neopentane, as the temperature is raised from 50 to 150. These results support the idea that a Tr-complexed half-reaction state is simultaneously involved in activation of the R-I bond and in the evident 1,2-methyl shift. This a-complex mechanism is the same as that first suggested almost a quarter of a century ago for neopentane isomerism during hydrogenolysis at >_ 200 on Pt catalysts. The present results also support the contention that similar 7r-complexes are responsible for analogous carbon skeleton rearrangement reactions mediated by coenzyme Biz.

However, while there is much evidence [1,3-5] since the initial suggestion in 1973 [3], that a 7r-complexed half-reaction state generates the 1,2-bond shift on the metal surfaces (Eq. (1)), there is no consensus even after extensive investigation of model systems about the mechanisms) of the rearrangements in BIZ catalysis. H3 H3C-H,C- ~ -CH3 ht 90 V. Amir-Ebrahimi, J.J. Rooney /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 89-92 In recent years most of the support has been for a free radical intermediate such that the central Co ion in the cornn complex of the coenzyme is merely acting as a free radical initiator, but plays no role otherwise in the H-atom abstraction and addition steps, and in the crucial bond shift step [2]. Very recently Mu He and Dowd [6], in a series of very elegant experiments, have shown Br-HOC- \\ Z -f- Bt.,s X = COSEt Y = CO,,Et Z - 'y ' ~Ph Dowd's work lends considerable support to our earlier suggestions [7-9] that 7r-complexes analogous to those postulated for the rearrangements on the metal surfaces also mediate the Br-HZC- Z We therefore decided to investigate the hydrogenolysis of neopentyl iodide vapour in an excess of flowing hydrogen on catalysts consisting of reduced Pt or Co dispersed on MgO, a basic support. The prediction was that bond shift would accompany R-I bond fission (Scheme 1), and that it would be easier than the analogous rearrangement starting with neopentane. The R-I bond is longer and weaker than the corresponding R-H bond and this should favour 7r-complex formation during the initial fission step. The basic support rules out a carbocationic mechanism which is possible on more acidic supports, e.g. A1203, etc. A 4 wt% Pt/Mg0 catalyst was prepared by conclusively using well-designed model substrates, that free radicals do not participate in the rearrangements catalysed by B t2. They studied the reactions in Eq. (2) and found that the C3 ring (group Z) remains intact after 1,2 shift of group X. Quite clearly, free radicals of the type X-CH 2-CZY are not present since the C 3 ring in Z has not opened.

A 10 wt% Co/Mg0 sample was also prepared by impregnating the support with Co(N03)2 from aqueous solution, followed by drying, calcination at 500 and reduction in H 2 at 500 for several hours. A 10 wt% Co/Si02 catalyst was also made in the same way. Typical results are recorded in Table 1. All the catalysts behaved in the same fashion with both the conversion of the substrate and the % bond shift increasing as the temperature was raised, so increasing direct formation of the 7r-complex intermediate (Scheme 1) is indi- V Amir-Ebrahimi, J.J.

There is also a concomitant increase in conversion and a more evident extensive reversible poisoning effect by I-adatoms on alkene hydrogenation. This is especially true of the cobalt catalysts. The initial 2-methylbut-l-yl species formed via the 1,2-bond shift of a methyl group is then showing an increasing tendency to eliminate a (3-H atom to give the corresponding two alkenes rather than add an H atom and desorb off the surface as 2-methylbutane. Neopentyl bromide reacts in the same way as the iodide but the Br-adatoms do not poison hydrogenation to the same extent as the Iadatoms. Thus, the only products are paraffinic consisting mainly of neopentane at low conversion at 70, but largely 2-methylbutane at high Table 1 Product distributions from neopentyliodide hydrogenolysis Cat.

As a final test, PtO,, without a support and reduced at 150 was found to give the same results as Pt/Mg0 for hydrogenolysis of both the iodide and bromide, i.e. only the two paraffins, which are mainly neopentane at 100 and mainly 2-methylbutane at 150. This proves that the metal sites alone are responsible. The correspondence between the solid metal and the metalloenzyme catalysis described here is powerful support for the 7r-complex mechanism. The same mechanism also applies to all the bond shift rearrangements noted for B and especially to the hydroxy group shift in the 1,2-diol rearrangements [2], where a free radical mechanism per se is not immediately obvious. Indeed, the 7r-complex mechanism four the 1,2diol reaction was first suggested in 1977 by Salem et al. [10], even though these authors were then unaware that the same mechanism had been advanced several years earlier to account for neopentane isomerization to 2-methylbutane on Pt [3]. Another very important consequence if the ,7r-complex mechanism is valid for 13,21 is that the metal bound radical, and not the free radical, may be involved in the next crucial step, namely 92 V.

The reaction is then that of the R ~-[Co ~ ] di-radical engaged in a [2 + 2] addition to R-H. Such [2 + 2] reactions are well known and are often very stereospecific in the area of catalysis by electron-deficient metal complexes, espe cially Ziegler-Natta polymerization of simple alkenes [ 12]. The H-atom abstraction step in the BIZ field of catalysis is also very stereospecific [2] and this is to be expected [7] if it is the bound radical and not the free radical which is responsible, as described by Eq. (5). In conclusion, the [Co]-alkyl chemistry in volved in Blz catalysis may have many features in common with important aspects of metal-al- kyl behaviour in the general field of catalysis, both homogeneous and heterogeneous.
