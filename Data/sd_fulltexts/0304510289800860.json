J. DEN HARTOG, A. G. T. M. BASTEIN and V. PONEC* Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, P.O. Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden (The Netherlands) Summary Supported metal catalysts were studied in the reactions of n-hexane and neohexane (= 2,2-dimethylbutane). The metals used were the 2nd and 3rd row Group VIII metals. The catalysts were modified by adding VOCI;. This 'modification' led to a strong decrease in the CO/M ratios at high reduction temperatures, a behaviour known as the SMSI effect. For all metals studied except Pt modification by VOCI; results in a decrease in the selectivity to hydrogenolysis, which is ascribed here to the so-called ensemble size effect. In the case of Pt, an increase in the hydrogenolysis selectivity is observed. The deviating behaviour of Pt is explained by the single site adsorption of hydrocarbons on this metal. Introduction In the presence of metal catalysts, alkanes can be converted in mixtures with hydrogen via hydrogenolysis, isomerization and dehydrocyclization reactions. Selectivity patterns which are typical for each metal can be strongly influenced by alloying a metal with another metal, or by depositing carbon or sulfur on the surface of the metal. Shirts in selectivity in the hydrocarbon reactions thus induced can often be explained by variations in the distribution and size of available metal ensembles (for a review see [1]; an ensemble is defined as the minimum number of contiguous active metal atoms required by the reaction). A decrease in the average ensemble size or elimination of large ensembles usually results in the suppression of hydrogenolysis, which is believed to require large ensembles with most of the metals [1,2]. Yet another way to modify the surface of a metal has received wide attention during the last decade. Tauster et al. [3] observed a strong de- crease in the Ha adsorption capacity of supported metal catalysts, when the metals were supported on a reducible oxide (TiOa, NbzOs, VaOs, etc.) and reduced at temperatures above 400 C. This effect, called the 'Strong *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 130 Metal Support Interaction' (SMSI), is now generally believed to result mainly from a coverage of the active metal by the partly reduced support moieties [4]. In the so-called SMSI state, generally a strong decrease in the activity of the catalyst in hydrocarbon reactions is observed, irrespective of the active metal or the reaction studied (C^tl^ or butane hydrogenolysis and C2H4 or benzene hydrogenation have been already used as model reac- tions) [5-9]. Whereas the activity changes due to the SMSI effect are well docu- mented, only a few studies thus far have been devoted to the selectivity changes caused by SMSI, and the results are rather ambiguous: some studies report a decrease in the selectivity for hydrogenolysis [10 -12], whereas other studies claim that there is no effect on the selectivity patterns [13]. The absence of variations in the selectivity patterns is often observed when TiOa is used as a support, and various tentative explanations have been offered for this phenomenon. Schepers et al. [11] argue that a patch-like coverage of the Rh surface by TiO; might still leave a sufficient number of large ensembles unaffected. As a result, the total activity drops but the selectivity remains the same after high temperature reduction (HTR). The same type of explanation has been suggested for the effects observed with the Pt/Au system. Here an epitaxially Au layer grown on top of Pt causes suppression of the total activity but does not affect the hydrogenolytic selectivity. Only subsequent annealing and alloy formation affects the selec- tivity by a decrease in hydrogenolysis [14,15]. A different explanation is proposed by Anderson et al. [13], who studied the SMSI effect with the Pt/Ti02 catalysts. The authors observed that neither changing the support from SiOa to TiOa, nor a reduction of the TiOi-supported sample at high temperatures results in pronounced changes of the selectivity in the n-hexane conversion. As explanation, the authors suggest that in reactions of hydro- carbons on Pt catalysts a single-site mechanism is operating. The SMSI effect can be simulated by adding certain 'promoter' com- pounds to a metal catalyst [7,16,17]. Vanadium, molybdenum or niobium salts used as promoters cover the catalyst efficiently. (N.B. The term 'pro- moter' is justified by synthesis gas chemistry, where the addition of these compounds indeed leads to an enhanced activity and/or a changed selec- tivity [4,18,19]). In contrast to the amount of work devoted to the pro- moter effects in syngas reactions, very few data exist on the effects of promoter addition on hydrocarbon reactions. The available literature reports only a drop in activity when a promoted ('modified') catalyst (e.g. with V, Nb, Cr, or Mn compounds) is reduced at elevated temperatures [20]. Therefore, a systematic study has been performed and is described in this paper, to identify the potential effects on 2nd and 3rd row Group VIII metals in reactions of n-hexane and neohexane. VOCI; was chosen as a 'modifier', since it is known as a very efficient promoter in syngas reactions (it enhances CO dissociation as well as oxygenate formation over Rh catalysts [17] ). The effect is likely related to the ability of VOClz to spread over the metal surface. It must be mentioned here that the state of the 131 modifier under actual reaction conditions is probably VOC1, since VOCI; is known to disproportionate into volatile VOC13 and rather stable VOC1, at temperatures above 300 C. The latter compound is stable up to at least 700 C[21]. Experimental Two series of catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. Modified catalysts were prepared by coimpregnation, which implies that the metal precursor and VOCI; were added simultaneously to the impregnation solu- tion. All catalysts were prepared from an acidic solution containing addi- tional HC1. The metal precursors used were HzPHOH)^, RhCIs, RuCIa, PdCl; and (NH4)2lrCl6 (all supplied by Johnson Matthey). The supports used were Aerosil 200 (Degussa, 200 m2 g-1) and Kieselgel (Merck, 480 m2 g-1). The catalysts were reduced in situ for 5 h prior to the catalytic experi- ment. The reaction was carried out in a fixed bed, plug flow reactor, ac- cording to a program defining an increasing and a decreasing temperature regime. The hexane/H; ratio used was 1/16. Some experiments were performed in a pulsed flow reactor. During the latter experiment, the temperature was kept constant and a flow of H; was led over the catalyst. The activity and selectivity of the clean cata- lysts were determined by leading a gas mixture of n-hexane/H^ (50 JL(I; ratio 1:16) over the catalyst, while the products were frozen in liquid nitrogen. With both the continuous and the pulse flow techniques, GC analysis was performed and evaluated automatically. Details of analysis and of selectivity calculations have been described previously [22]. As an example, the selectivity to isomerization is expressed by eqn. (1). Similar equations are used to calculate other selectivities. 2 JC,^ Siso = Jr1 100% (1) i iC^ 1=1 Herein C,00 is a reaction product and C,0^ is an isomerization product (n = number of C atoms in reacting hydrocarbon). In the reactions of n- hexane, the multifission parameter is defined according to eqn. (2): Aft = (402 + 303 + 2C4 + Cs)/Ci (2) When Ci units are terminally split off (one by one), Mf should be near unity. When internal splitting is important (Ce -* 2C3 or Cg - Ca + ), the Aft should exceed unity considerably. If a multiple splitting takes place (Ce -* 6Ci), an Mf factor lower than 1 will be expected. 132 Catalyst characterization CO/M ratios were determined after an in situ reduction in a Quanta- sorb adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome). In this determination, CO is injected m the Ha flow at room temperature. CO uptake is determined using a TCD. The average particle size was determined by using XRD line broadening (Philips goniometer PW 1050/25 equipped with a Cu Ka tube (Cu 2103/00)). The particle size was calculated using the simple Scherrer equation. Results The metals studied here in the reactions of hexanes are the metals from the second and third rows of the Group VIII metals. In all cases, a modified catalyst was compared with a regular unmodified catalyst. In all cases, the support was silica and VOCli was used as a modifier. Reactions of two isomers of hexane were studied: n-hexane and neohexane (2,2- dimethylbutane ). All catalysts were characterized by XRD and CO chemisorption. The results of the characterization and other relevant information are presented in Table 1. In Table 2 the essential results obtained with the hexane/Ha reaction are presented for all the metals studied. These results will be described and discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.

In these experiments the reduction temperature has been varied. In- creasing the reduction temperature results in a decrease in the hydrogeno- lytic selectivity. As far as the activity is concerned, addition of V and an increase in Tred both result in a decrease in activity. This is demonstrated by Fig. 2. Also plotted here is the CO chemisorption capacity of the mod- ified catalyst as a function of the reduction temperature. The decrease in the CO/M ratio implies that at higher reduction tem- peratures the metal surface becomes blocked and shows 'SMSI behaviour'. An effect of deposited carbon on the selectivity patterns is often found. To verify this effect, the catalysts were studied in an increasing and decreasing temperature regime. In all cases, a decrease in activity was observed when going from the increasing temperature regime to the subse- quent decreasing temperature regime. This indicates the existence of self- poisoning, obviously due to carbonaceous deposits. Also a small shift in the group selectivities was found: selectivity to hydrogenolysis is lower in the decreasing temperature regime. Neohexane Neohexane is used as an 'archetypical' molecule for certain adsorbed complexes: under specified conditions (using a low conversion level to avoid multiple reactions) the reaction products provide direct information about the adsorption mode of the substrate molecule. These adsorption modes are shown in Fig. 3. The results obtained with the modified catalyst are presented in Table 3. All catalysts show hydrogenolysis selectivities of over 95%, mostly in- duced by a,(3-adsorption. At higher reduction temperatures a shift from the a/y'-adsorption to o:,7-adsorption is observed.

This is clearly demonstrated by the presence of propane and butane, two products that cannot be formed by one single reaction step. Also, when few or no multiple reactions occur, the ratio (neopentane + isopentane)/ methane should be equal to unity. However, the deviation from this ratio and the already mentioned presence of both butane and propane indicate here a contribution of multiple reactions. Pt catalysts n-Hexane It is known that unreactive carbonaceous layers ('C') are more easily deposited on the surface of a platinum catalyst than on other metals [23], and that these carbonaceous layers sometimes influence the group selec- tivities. Furthermore, it is known that the deposition of 'C' is sensitive to the particle size [24]; the effect of these deposits can thus be varied by varying the particle size. All these secondary effects can, in principle, be influenced by the modifier. In order to verify these trivial, and for this particular study less relevant, effects on the hexane/Ha reaction, two types 136 100 80- 60- 40- 20- (a) \"\" '\"\" T( C) ' '\" (b) \"\" -'\"\" T( C) J )\" Fig. 4.

Although the values for the group selectivities vary with the particle size, the effect of the addition of VOCI; remains essentially the same. Modifying the catalyst results in a slight increase in the hydrogen- olysis selectivity for both types of catalysts. In Figs. 4a and 4b the hydrogenolysis selectivities are plotted as func- tions of the reaction temperature for various catalysts prepared at varying reduction temperatures. Figure 4a shows the results for the large particle catalyst, and Fig. 4b for the small particle catalyst. In Fig. 5 the activity plots are shown. Whereas modifying a Rh catalyst results in a decrease in the selectivity to hydrogenolysis, the opposite effect is found in the case of Pt as the active component of the catalyst. Also, the drop in activity by the presence of the modifier is not the same with different metals (the activity drop is much smaller on Pt than on Ir, Rh and Ru, see Table 2). The multifission parameter is not changed by the addition of the V modifier, indicating that the mode of hydrogenolysis (described by the relative contributions of internal, terminal or multiple fission) remains the same. All catalysts show a high extent of internal fission, as is often reported for Pt catalysts [1]. 800 Y (au) 250 300 350 (a) T( C) Fig. 5.

However, under conditions of minimum 'C' deposi- tion, the results were also similar to those obtained in the continuous flow experiments. Thus, the effects induced by the modifier are not due to the effect of the modifier on the 'C' deposits. Neohexane Reactions with neohexane were performed with the catalysts con- taining small metal particles. The standard, unmodified catalyst favours the a,7 and a/y '-adsorption over a,ss-adsorption, as has already been reported [25]. With the modified catalyst this overall selectivity feature is not dif- ferent. Only at temperatures below 340 C a small increase in the hydrogen- olysis selectivity is found, resulting from a shift of a,7'-isomerization to u!,7'-hydrogenolysis. At higher reaction temperatures, this small effect is reversed and the modified catalysts show a lower selectivity in hydrogen- olysis. The effects found at higher reduction temperatures thus resemble those found with Rh catalysts. The results on the o:,ss-hydrogenolysis of neo- hexane are plotted in Fig. 6. In all cases small amounts of propane and butane were found, products resulting from multiple reactions. TOO-r S'/. 50- Y .-- 2SO 300 350 400 Tt-C) Fig. 6.

Ir, Ru and Pd catalysts All catalysts prepared with Ru, Pd and Ir show behaviour similar to that observed with Rh. Upon addition of a V modifier, the relative activity to hydrogenolysis decreases when compared with the standard catalysts. This is demonstrated for Ir and Pd in Figs. 7 and 8. Ruthenium is a very active catalyst (see Table 2) even at low tempera- tures, forming methane as the main (or even the only) product. Upon addition of the modifier, the catalysts remain active but a shift towards isomerization can be observed. Ir, which itself is not as strong a hydro- genolysis catalyst as the others mentioned, shows a modest shift in the group selectivities by modifying the catalyst with the V compound. 138 100- SC/.) 3IO 350 Fig. 7.

In all cases the multifission parameter, describing the cracking mode, increases upon addition of the V modifier. The increase indicates that the terminal fission and multiple fissions are partly replaced by the internal bond splitting. Reactions on the modifier surface In order to determine whether the modifier itself is active in the hexane/H2 reaction (e.g. by an 'acid' mechanism similar to that found by Grenoble et al. [26]), two experiments were performed. In the first experi- ment, l-hexene/Ha was led over a VOCl^/SiO; catalyst. In the second ex- periment, an n-hexane/Hi reaction was carried out over a layer of Pt/SiOz followed by a layer of VOC^/SiOa. In the latter experiment, the precursors which might react over VOC1 (i.e. partially dehydrogenated hydrocarbons) should be supplied by the Pt/SiOz layer. Neither of the two experiments revealed any activity of the modifier alone. 139 Discussion From the results presented above, several straightforward conclusions can be made. (1) In all cases the addition of the V modifier to the metal catalysts changes the catalytic behaviour of these catalysts; selectivity and activity in reactions of hydrocarbons are changed. (2) Although in all cases the activity decreases when the V modifier is added, this suppression is not the same for different metals (or different probe molecules). (3) The changes in selectivity induced by the V compound differ with the different metals. The metals studied can be subdivided into two groups: Pt on the one hand, and the other 2nd and 3rd row Group VIII metals on the other hand. The most intriguing observation is that under point (3). Addition of the vanadium modifier causes a noticeable decrease in the hydrogenolytic selectivity with Rh, Pd, Ru and to a smaller extent with Ir, whereas with Pt catalysts an increase in the hydrogenolytic selectivity is observed. There is no definitive explanation for the atypical behaviour of the Pt catalysts and some speculations are discussed below. At this point it is pertinent to mention an additional observation generally made in the study of Group VIII metals in hydrocarbon reactions. When these metals are compared ac- cording to their propensity to form isomerization products, the groups of metals found are the same as those presented above. Pt excels in isomeriza- tion, Ir and Pd are intermediate in this selectivity and the other metals show only a very low propensity to isomerize hydrocarbons [1, 27]. The analogy between these two different observations (the difference in isomerization and in the effect of vanadium) can possibly help to explain the different ef- fects resulting from the addition of V modifier to the metal catalysts. The following part of the discussion is split into two parts, concerning the addition of V modifier to the metals Rh, Ru, Pd and Ir and to Pt. In the speculative explanation presented here, various adsorbed com- plexes are suggested which are proposed by various authors (for reviews see [1] and [28]). These complexes are shown in Scheme 1 (vide infra). In this scheme a division is made between the single-site adsorbed and the multi-site adsorbed complexes. The bottom of the Scheme indicates which metals prefer which type of intermediate single- or multisite. One charac- teristic of these adsorbed complexes, i.e. the number of carbon atoms involved, is known quite reliably [1] (complexes involving 2, 3 and 5 carbon atoms are experimentally well documented), but the number of metal atoms involved is always uncertain. Therefore, we only discriminate between 'single'- and 'multiple'-site ensembles, without specifying the exact number of metal atoms involved. Moreover, the number of bonds between the intermediates and the surface is not exactly known; the indicated bonds merely illustrate the possibilities. 140 Catalysis by Rh, Ru, Ir and Pd Rhodium is the metal most thoroughly studied in this paper, among the metals listed above. However, all the effects found with Rh are also encountered with other metals of this group. Coverage of the Rh metal surface by the modifier was varied by varying the reduction temperature (ired)- Modification of the properties of the Rh catalysts were observed only when Tred > 250 C. The effects of the modifier are obviously less pronounced here than in the syngas (CO/H^) reactions [15-19]. When T,ed > 250 C, the activity of a given catalyst decreases with increasing Tred This decrease in activity parallels the decrease in CO adsorption capacity (CO/Rh in Fig. 2) and the increase in the isomerization selectivity (Fig. 1). It is remarkable that with Rh, Ru and Pd (Ni and Co also belong to this group), alloying with an inactive metal (such as Au or Cu) causes similar effects on the selectivity patterns [1]. The isomerization selectivity increases when the inactive component is added to the Group VIII metal. The suppres- sion of the activity by alloying is considerably stronger than could be ex- pected if the surface concentration of active metal alone were concerned. On these grounds it has been concluded [1] that the reactions which are strong- ly suppressed by alloying require more than one metal atom to operate as a reaction center. The presence of ensembles consisting of more than one ac- tive metal atom is of course strongly suppressed when an active (Group VIII) metal is diluted in an inactive (Group Ib) metal matrix. Additional support for the above-postulated multiply-bonded species (i.e. bound to several metal atoms) is also available. Such species have been demonstrated for example in the case of CO adsorption [29]. Upon adsorption of ethene (and ethyne), the ethylidyne species and its analogues are also bound via multiple bonds to the metal surface [30]. Hydrocarbon/D; exchange reactions also support the existence of multiply bound species (for a review see [1]). Due to the similarities between the effects of alloying and of adding the V modifier, we suggest that the modifier on Rh, Ru, Ir and Pd sup- presses the availability of large ensembles of active metal atoms. Thus the demanding hydrogenolysis reaction is strongly suppressed, whereas the less demanding reactions such as isomerization and dehydrocyclization are influenced to a lesser extent. Reactions of neohexane performed over Rh catalysts can supply addi- tional information about the mechanisms involved in hydrocarbon reac- tions. Modification of the Rh surface suppresses the formation of the 3C a,7- and the 2C a,jss-complexes (the latter resulting only in hydrogenolysis) to almost the same extent. From this observation one may conclude that, in the spirit of the foregoing paragraph, both a,7- and o;,ss-complexes on Rh and similar metals need large ensembles of active metal atoms, but the ratio of the different complexes is not influenced by the modifier. The main effect of the modifier in neohexane reactions then is the suppression of multiple reactions (demonstrated by the multifission parameter Mf in Table 3). This effect can be achieved when the residence time of molecules 141 on the surface or the apparent contact time is shortened. A shorter resi- dence time might be caused by a decrease in the average number of multiple bonds between the carbon and the metal. A shorter contact time could be due to partial blocking of the Rh surface. Pt catalysts The results obtained with Pt are different from those obtained with the other Group VIII metals. The activity of the Pt catalysts is suppressed less by the modifier (at the same nominal concentration) compared to the activity drop of the metals Ir, Rh and Ru, although the CO/Pt ratio de- creases by addition of a modifier or its improved coverage (SMSI) in the same way as with all other metals. However, the selectivity is changed by the modifier in the opposite way when Pt is compared with the other metals: hydrogenolysis is relatively favoured (i.e. less suppressed) over isomeriza- tion and dehydrocyclization. When T^, and therefore the blocking of Pt by the modifier, is increased, only marginal changes in the selectivity patterns are observed. However, the increasing Tred does result in a lower CO/Pt ratio, as already mentioned above and in other papers [13]. In many aspects thus Pt differs from the metals discussed in the preceding section. Effects similar to those described for vanadium compounds as modi- fying agents have been observed with Pt catalysts modified by TiO^ [13] or upon alloying Pt with Cu [31]. Some results found with the Pt/TiOz system in this study supply additional information. When the reduction temperature is varied with the Pt/TiO; system, the group selectivities do not change, as is also found with the Pt/V/SiO; system. The problem is now to explain the atypical behaviour of Pt. The following points may be important in explaining the observed phenomena and should thus be discussed: (i) Pt is usually more sensitive to changes in the metal particle size and in surface structure than other metals [1]. (ii) Pt catalysts are sensitive to changes in the extent and character of carbonaceous deposits, which are formed easily over this metal [23]. These layers are known to be influenced by e.g. alloying with an inactive metal and by variations in the particle size [24]. (iii) When Pt is alloyed with Cu, a relatively higher hydrogenolysis selec- tivity is found than with the pure Pt catalysts (in contrast with e.g. Ru, Ni or Co, where a dramatic suppression is observed) [1]. Alloying with Au suppresses destructive reactions, provided that a real alloy formation occurs. When Au is not well distributed, little or no effect on the hydrogenolytic selectivity is found [14,15]. (iv) The propensity to form intermediates which are adsorbed on more than one metal site varies on going from one metal to the other. An inspec- tion of literature and our own results suggests that most of the Group VIII metals would favour such intermediates (shown on the left hand side of Scheme 1) whereas Pt allows the formation of intermediates adsorbed on one site (shown on the right hand side of Scheme 1, below). 3U ,a ^ s00 ^ . aM f-1 0 X: tB H 4-1 01 4J a 4J x E aU-t <U f-l ^ .-1 o ciJS U.

Small and large Pt particles are modified by the V com- pounds in a very similar manner. The possible effect of 'C' deposits (ii) has been checked by experiments carried out in a pulsed flow reactor. The pulses used were so small that little or no carbon deposition took place. Yet, the behaviour of the catalysts in the pulsed flow reactor is again similar to that of the same catalysts in the continuous flow reactors, which implies that 'C' deposition cannot explain the results found with the Pt catalysts. The data mentioned under (iii) and the results presented by this paper indicate that attention should be focussed on the points presented under (iv). This has led to the proposal of the network shown in Scheme 1. In this scheme two types of surface intermediates (multiply-coordinated on the left and singly-coordinated on the right) are presented, and it is further indicated which products they yield and by which reaction path (3C or bond shift mechanism, 5C or cyclic mechanism, a^-hydrogenolysis, o;,'y-hydrogenolysis and ring closures) they occur. The negligible effect of the Tied on the modified Pt catalyst strengthens our and other authors' suspicions that this metal can operate also via a single-site mechanism [13,32]. Once the surface of the metal is partly covered by the V modifier (or by Ti species), no additional change in the selectivities is found, even though the total metal surface area changes. A change would be expected if ensemble size effects due to the modifier were important in these systems. However, no change should be expected if the prevailing intermediates were bound to single Pt atoms. In organometallic chemistry, numerous examples of complexes are known in which hydrocarbons are bound through more than one carbon atom to a single metal atom or ion [35]. This stimulated McKervey to suggest that single-site complexes are the only ones operating in homo- geneous and heterogeneous catalysis [32]. This also inspired Anderson et al. to postulate that on a Pt surface single-site adsorption is strongly fa- voured [13]. We believe that such postulates [13,32] can indeed explain the results presented in this paper. We propose that the following effects are related: (a) the different propensity of the various metals to catalyze isomerization; (b) the effect on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of a V compound as a modifier; and (c) the effect on Shydr f alloying the Group VIII metals with Cu. The three mentioned effects can all be accounted for by assuming a certain order in the propensity of Group VIII metals to adsorb hydro- carbons on multiple or single sites. This sequence, which has as a conse- quence the situation shown in Scheme 1, is, as already mentioned: Ru, Rh, Pd < Ir < Pt The reactions of neohexane (2,2-dimethylbutane) over Pt/SiO; and Pt/V/SiO; still remain to be discussed. At low temperatures the unmodified catalyst shows a somewhat smaller hydrogenolysis selectivity, whereas at higher temperatures (Treac > 340 C) this trend is reversed and the un- 144 modified catalyst shows higher hydrogenolysis selectivities (Fig. 6). In neohexane, obviously, a 5C single-site adsorption is not possible [1,32]. The observation of just a small shift to higher hydrogenolysis selectivities, or even a decrease, might indicate that in the n-hexane reactions the exis- tence of the 5C single-site adsorbed complex results m an increase in S^y^i when the V modifier is added. It is quite reasonable to expect that the presence of the V modifier suppresses the formation of the planar 5C single- site complex more than that of the single-site 3C complexes. Moreover, the presence of a V modifier, which is known to accommodate large amounts of H; [36], can possibly increase the degree of dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon, thus increasing the selectivity towards hydrogenolysis via deeply dehydrogenated intermediates (which would otherwise isomerize via the 5C single-site mechanism) and in doing so suppress isomerization. Copper might play a similar role (since it can bind some Ha) in in- creasing hydrogenolysis selectivity. This is not expected for Au, which does not adsorb H; or hydrocarbons. The importance of the capacity of the modifying agent to adsorb Ha suggests that different modifiers (with varying H; adsorption capacities) should result in different shifts in Shydr. which was indeed found experi- mentally. Conclusions (1) The metals Ru, Rh and Pd show a strong shift from (multiple) hydrogenolysis to isomerization and dehydrocyclization upon addition of a vanadium compound to the metal. This observation is explained in terms of ensemble size effects. (2) Addition of a V modifier to a Pt catalyst results in an increase in the hydrogenolysis selectivity in reactions of n-hexane, and some decrease in the total activity. This is explained by assuming that Pt prefers single-site adsorption. The formation of 5C complexes is affected to a larger extent than that of the 3C complexes. (3) The increase in the hydrogenolysis selectivity is induced by the suppression of the 5C adsorption mode and is likely supported by the dehydrogenating power of the V-modified Pt surface. (4) Ir exhibits behaviour in between that of Pt and the other Group VIII metals tested.

Supported metal catalysts were studied in the reactions of n-hexane and neohexane (= 2,2-dimethylbutane). The metals used were the 2nd and 3rd row Group VIII metals. The catalysts were modified by adding VOC12. This 'modification' led to a strong decrease in the CO/M ratios at high reduction temperatures, a behaviour known as the SMSI effect. For all metals studied — except Pt — modification by VOC12 results in a decrease in the selectivity to hydrogenolysis, which is ascribed here to the so-called ensemble size effect. In the case of Pt, an increase in the hydrogenolysis selectivity is observed. The deviating behaviour of Pt is explained by the single site adsorption of hydrocarbons on this metal. References 1 V.
