DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60469-5 ARTICLE Preparation of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 Catalyst Using NaBH 4 as Reducing Agent and Its Performance in Selective Hydrogenation of Benzene XUE Wei a , QIN Yanfei, LI Fang, WANG Yanji b , WANG Zhimiao Hebei Provincial Key Lab of Green Chemical Technology and High Efficient Energy Saving, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin 300130, China Abstract: A Ru-[bmim]BF 4 catalyst was prepared in a mixture of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]BF 4 ) and H 2 O using NaBH 4 as a reducing agent. The Ru-[bmim]BF 4 catalyst showed higher selectivity for cyclohexene than a catalyst reduced by N 2 H 4 Â·H 2 O because of the influence of boron. When Ru-[bmim]BF 4 was reused, higher activity and lower selectivity were obtained because the number of Ru active sites increased through leaching of the ionic liquid. The used catalyst also contained ZnOHF formed in the reaction between F â€“ and ZnSO 4 , which was an additive in the reaction. Under the influence of the ionic liquid as a template, ZnOHF grew along the (001) direction and exhibited rod-like morphology. Key words: ruthenium; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate; sodium borohydride; zinc hydroxyfluoride; benzene; selective hydrogenation Selective hydrogenation of benzene is a way to produce cyclohexene and has been the focus of both industrial and academic researchers because of its atom economy and inex- pensive raw materials [1â€“6]. However, cyclohexane is more readily obtained during hydrogenation of benzene than cyclo- hexene. To increase the selectivity for cyclohexene, Ru-based catalysts as well as H 2 O are used. ZnSO 4 is also added to in- crease the hydrophilicity of the catalyst. This limits readsorp- tion of cyclohexene onto the catalyst surface through its low solubility in H 2 O. As a result, further hydrogenation is prohib- ited and the selectivity for cyclohexene increases. In recent years, ionic liquids (ILs), as a novel kind of sol- vent, medium and catalyst, have been widely used in organic synthesis, catalysis, extraction, and material preparation. ILs are expected to act as an effective reaction medium or additive in selective hydrogenation of benzene. Rossi et al. [2] prepared Ru(0) nanoparticles from a RuO 2 precursor in imidazolium IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]BF 4 ) for selective hydrogenation of benzene. The cyclohexene (65%) was obtained when benzene conversion was only 0.3%. Silveira et al. [3] and Liu et al. [4] prepared Ru-based catalysts in ILs [bmim]PF 6 and [beim]Cl, respectively. However, cyclohexene was only obtained with high selectivity at low rates of conversion. Schwab et al. [5] investigated the influence of several kinds of ILs as additives on the selective hydro- genation of benzene. They indicated that some ILs, such as [B3MPyr][DCA], could enhance the hydrophilicity of the Ru catalyst and adsorb onto its surface. This reduced the catalytic activity of Ru, allowing more cyclohexene to be obtained. However, they also observed that high selectivity for cyclo- hexene of ~60% appeared only in the initial stage of the reac- tion; in other words, at low benzene conversion. When hy- drogenation was continued, the obtained cyclohexene could be readsorbed onto the Ru active sites and further hydrogenated to cyclohexane. We prepared Ru-[bmim]BF 4 catalyst in a mixture of [bmim]BF 4 and H 2 O using N 2 H 4 Â·H 2 O as a reductant [6]. Over this catalyst, 12.2% benzene was converted into cyclohexene XUE Wei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1913â€“1918 with a selectivity of 40.5%. It was also found that a Ru-carbene metal complex formed through the interaction between imi- dazolium cations and Ru particles under alkaline conditions. Although the abovementioned Ru-[bmim]BF 4 catalyst achieved better results than other analogous catalysts [2â€“5], it was unable to match the performance of traditional Ru-Zn catalysts. There are a number of possible ways to improve the catalytic performance of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 that require further investigation. Sun et al. [7] prepared Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 for selective hydro- genation of benzene using NaBH 4 as a reductant. They achieved a selectivity for cyclohexene of up to 80% after 54% benzene conversion. The high selectivity for cyclohexene was attributed to the boron in the catalyst. In this paper, a Ru cata- lyst was prepared in a mixture of [bmim]BF 4 and H 2 O using NaBH 4 as a reductant. The performance of the resulting cata- lyst for selective hydrogenation of benzene is determined, and the change of the catalyst during the reaction is also discussed. Ru-[bmim]BF 4 catalyst was prepared in a similar manner to that described in the literature [6] using NaBH 4 as a reductant instead of N 2 H 4 Â·H 2 O. A molar ratio of NaBH 4 to Ru of 10:1 was used. The obtained catalyst had a Ru content of 10 wt% and was named Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II. The Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II cata- lyst was washed thoroughly with ethanol and double distilled H 2 O, and then dried at 80 ï‚°C for 12 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer and Cu K Î± radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a PE PHI-1600 spec- trometer with a Mg K Î± source (1253.6 eV). Binding energies were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peaks at 284.6 eV arising from adventitious carbon. Transmission electron mi- croscope (TEM) images were obtained with an FEI TECNOL 20 microscope. Selective hydrogenation of benzene was carried out in a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave fitted with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical experiment, benzene, Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst and ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O were introduced into the autoclave together with H 2 O as a solvent. The autoclave was sealed and pressurized with N 2 for leak testing, then purged and the temperature was adjusted to that desired. Pressurized H 2 was then introduced into the autoclave to react with benzene. At the end of the reaction, the autoclave was cooled in an ice bath and vented. The catalyst was separated by centrifugation, and the liquid was separated into water and an oil phase. The reaction prod- ucts in the oil phase were identified and quantified by capillary gas chromatography using a BAIF SP-3420 chromatograph with a 50 m ï‚´ 0.25 mm PEG 20M column and flame ionization detector. Figure 1 shows an XRD pattern of the fresh Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst. A broad peak is centered at a 2Î¸ of ~43Â°, which was assigned to amorphous Ru-B alloy by Liu et al. [8]. The broadness of this peak indicates the small size of the Ru particles. TEM images of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst are presented in Fig. 2(a). A large number of Ru particles, with diameters of about 1â€“2 nm, are loosely aggregated with some organic compounds coating the outside. The external layer is possibly remnant IL. Selective hydrogenation of benzene was carried out to evaluate the performance of the Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst; the Fig. 2. TEM images of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalysts.

(a) (b) (c) XUE Wei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1913â€“1918 results are listed in Table 1. Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II shows slightly lower activity than that of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -I catalyst, which was prepared using N 2 H 4 Â·H 2 O as a reductant. However, the selec- tivity for cyclohexene over the former catalyst is far higher than that obtained over Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -I. This difference may be attributed to the effect of boron. To clarify the influence of boron on catalyst performance, Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II was characterized by XPS (Fig. 3). Because the Ru 3d 3/2 peak overlaps with that of C1s, only the Ru 3d 5/2 peak is considered in the following discussion. From Fig. 3, one can see that almost all of Ru is present in its elemental state with a binding energy (BE) of 280.7 eV, which is slightly higher than that of elemental Ru (280.0 eV) reported by Liu et al. [8]. This positive shift may be assigned to the remaining [bmim]BF 4 on the surface of Ru. The BF 4 â€“ anion attracts elec- trons strongly, which can decrease the electron density of Ru and increase the BE of inner electrons. Moreover, surface oxidation of Ru by O 2 before XPS measurement would also result in a positive shift of BE [6]. According to the BE of B 1s (193.5 eV), oxidized boron was present in the Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst [9]. These oxides may come from the hydrolysis of NaBH 4 . Xie et al. [10] found that the presence of oxidized boron species on the surface of Ru catalyst could greatly enhance the hydrophilicity of the catalyst by interacting with water molecules through hydrogen bond- ing. In addition, according to the asymmetry of the B 1s XPS spectra, there was some elemental boron with a lower BE in the catalyst. Elemental boron would donate electrons to elemental Ru, making boron electron deficient, which also promotes water adsorption on the catalyst surface, because elec- tron-deficient boron can readily accept the lone electron pair on the oxygen atom in a water molecule. Therefore, during selec- tive hydrogenation of benzene, further hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane is retarded by reducing the read- sorption of cyclohexene on the hydrophilic catalyst surface. Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst that had been used once was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation and then reused for selective hydrogenation of benzene without any further treatment. Entry 3 in Table 1 indicates that Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II showed low stability during the reaction, because the selectivity for cyclohexene decreased significantly when benzene conversion increased to 59.6%. Figure 1(b) shows an XRD pattern of the Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst that had been used once. There are obvious differences between the patterns of the catalysts before and after reaction. The peaks corresponding to metallic Ru become strong and sharp, which indicates that Ru particles gradually increase in size because of the H 2 atmosphere in the reaction. It also in- dicates that the protection from the IL was weakened. There are also some strong diffraction peaks assigned to zinc hydroxyfluoride (ZnOHF), which formed during selective hydrogenation of benzene through a reaction between [bmim]BF 4 and ZnSO 4 , an additive in the selective hydro- genation of benzene. Wu et al. [11] synthesized ZnOHF nano- fibers from Zn 5 (OH) 8 (NO 3 ) 2 Â·2H 2 O in the presence of the IL 1,2,3-trimethylimid-azolium tetrafluoroborate. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show TEM images of the Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst after one use. There are two main kinds of substance in the images. Some are agglomerations of small particles, which are presumed to be metallic Ru particles. Compared with Fig. 2(a), the Ru particles in the used catalyst are clearer because the IL protection layer is absent, which also allows the Ru particles to aggregate. The other type of substance in the image is rod-like particles with widths of up to 200 nm and lengths on the micro scale. These rod-like particles are ZnOHF.

XPS spectra of Ru 3d (a) and B 1s (b) for Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst. XUE Wei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1913â€“1918 XPS measurements of the used Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst revealed that the content of N on the surface decreased from 18.8% to 1.7%, which also indicated the leaching of IL from the surface of Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II. These results all suggest that there were more exposed me- tallic Ru active sites in the used Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst than the fresh one. Therefore, the used catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity and lower selectivity for cyclohexene. Liu et al. [12] reported that when the transition metal ion was reduced by NaBH 4 , a small amount of sodium metaborate was found in the product, which made it weakly basic. As a result, the basic Ru-[bmim]BF 4 -II catalyst readily reacted with ZnSO 4 , an additive with weak acidity, during the selective hydrogenation of benzene, producing Zn(OH) 2 and partly covering Ru active sites. This reduced the catalytic activity and increased the selectivity for cyclohexene. However, because of the presence of [bmim]BF 4 in this study, ZnOHF was formed in the used catalyst instead of Zn(OH) 2 . A mechanism for the formation of ZnOHF is proposed as follows (Eqs. 1 and 2) from the work of Dai et al. [13]: Zn 2+ + F â€“ â†’ ZnF + (1) ZnF + + OH â€“ â†’ ZnOHF (2) First, Zn 2+ rapidly combines with F âˆ’ from [bmim]BF 4 to form a ZnF + complex (Eq. (1)). Solid ZnOHF is then obtained from the reaction between ZnF + and OH âˆ’ (Eq. (2)), which is present from the hydrolysis of NaBH 4 . In addition, because of hydrogen bonding and Ï€-Ï€ stacking, the (110) plane of ZnOHF is covered by an adsorbed layer of BF 4 âˆ’ , which slows the rate of growth. At the same time, [bmim] + cations align and arrange along the (110) plane driven by the coulomb coupling force, which leads to ordered growth of ZnOHF in the [001] direction to form rod-like crystals with a 1D feature.

        "dc:description": "A Ru-[bmim]BF4 catalyst was prepared in a mixture of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]BF4) and H2O using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The Ru-[bmim]BF4 catalyst showed higher selectivity for cyclohexene than a catalyst reduced by N2H4·H2O because of the influence of boron. When Ru-[bmim]BF4 was reused, higher activity and lower selectivity were obtained because the number of Ru active sites increased through leaching of the ionic liquid. The used catalyst also contained ZnOHF formed in the reaction between F− and ZnSO4, which was an additive in the reaction. Under the influence of the ionic liquid as a template, ZnOHF grew along the (001) direction and exhibited rod-like morphology.",
