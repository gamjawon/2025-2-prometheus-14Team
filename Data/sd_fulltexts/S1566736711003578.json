A novel catalytic hollow fibre microreactor (CHFMR) that uses an asymmetric YSZ hollow fibre has been developed for on-board H2 generation to be used in portable device applications. In the development of CHFMR, the 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst that was selected as a catalyst for the ethanol steam reforming (ESR) was impregnated into the inner surface of YSZ hollow fibres using the sol–gel Pechini technique. The catalytic activity tests were performed in the YSZ hollow fibres and the results were compared with fixed-bed reactors. An excellent catalyst utilisation in the CHFMR enables a small quantity of catalyst to be used for the ESR. The result shows that 8 units of CHFMR that only has an 18mg catalyst produced a relatively similar amount of H2 compared to a fixed-bed reactor that used 100mg. Graphical abstract A catalytic hollow fibre microreactor is developed for on-board H2 production. Ethanol steam reforming is used to test the benefit of finger-like structure. H2 obtained in 8 fibres with only an 18mg catalyst is similar to 100mg fixed-bed reactor. Keywords Catalytic hollow fibre microreactor Ethanol steam reforming Finger-like structure Conical microchannel Sol–gel Pechini method 1 Introduction To date, batteries are still widely used for powering a number of portable devices [1]. Typically, the performance and operational period of batteries depend on their basic designs and how they are used. However, the use of batteries has a number of drawbacks including a short operating period, the cell capacity diminishes over time, sensitivity over high temperature and disposal problems [2]. To overcome the limitation of batteries as an energy provider to portable devices, the fuel cell technology has been regarded as an alternative to replace this available technology [3]. Initially, the fuel cell is developed for large scale applications and transportations but researchers also focus on the possibility of developing much smaller units to provide lower prices per kilowatt [4–6]. This has led to great interest to develop miniature fuel cell that is small enough to replace batteries in portable device application [7]. The development of portable devices which could incorporate fuel cell as a battery replacement has been initiated by various manufacturers. Manhattan Scientifics Inc. develops the Micro-Fuel Cell™ to be used with mobile phones [7]. The Micro-Fuel Cell™, which used a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), is used as an instant charger to provide power supply to the mobile phone while it is in the holster. This company claims that the DMFC can provide up to 18 to 27h of talk time, 3 to 5 times higher than the specific energy offered by lithium-ion batteries. In more recent development of notebook powered by fuel cells, Samsung Electronics in Korea has developed a notebook computer powered by a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system [8]. The notebook is equipped with a compact methanol-reforming system with a CO preferential oxidation unit, a 16-cell PEMFC stack, and a control unit for the management of the system with a direct current converter. Hydrogen fuel that has been produced in large scale either using conventional techniques or using renewable energy, e.g. solar and wind, can be used directly for fuel cells in large scale applications, such as industrial scale and the automotive industry. The storage of H2 is less complicated compared to portable devices in which H2 can be stored easily either using compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2) or liquid hydrogen (LH2). However, fuel supply for portable device is still problematic even though a compact fuel cell has been successfully developed. For small scale application, metal hydrides has been regarded a promising technique to store hydrogen for fuel cell used in the portable device application because the materials to synthesis metal hydride is easily available and cheap [9]. Furthermore, the performance of metal hydride can be improved by reducing its size into nanoscale particle [9]. However, metal hydrides that have been considered as a state of art for storing H2 for portable unit can only store a small amount of H2 and it is difficult for hydrogen to be desorbed under ambient conditions [10,11]. The use of liquid methanol directly in the DMFC is still unfavourable due to toxicity of methanol and a relatively low specific power offered by the DMFC [7,12]. Owing to the drawback of metal hydrides and the DMFC, there has been an increasing interest to use a compact reformer in on-board H2 generation to produce H2 instantly for the fuel cell system [13–16]. The use of on-board H2 generation enables various liquid fuels to be used as fuel supply which consequently reduces problems related to H2 storage. Ethanol which exists as liquid at room temperature can be considered as an alternative fuel over methanol. In addition, ethanol has various advantages, i.e. non-toxic, easily decomposed in the presence of water and renewable energy source [17–21]. Besides, the microreactor technology with a compact design and high efficiency has been proposed for the development of on-board H2 generation that can be used in portable device applications. Recently, asymmetric Al2O3 hollow fibre, prepared by phase inversion and sintering technique has been used as a microreactor substrate for the WGS reaction [22,23]. It has been reported that the microchannels in the finger-like region of the asymmetric Al2O3 hollow fibre, formed during the phase inversion process, act as a microreactor that can enhance the efficiency of the WGS reaction [23]. In this study, an asymmetric yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) hollow fibre is proposed as a microreactor substrate for the development of catalytic hollow fibre microreactor (CHFMR) for on-board H2 generation using the ethanol steam reforming (ESR) reaction. This ceramic substrate offers a high surface area/volume ratio due to its smaller diameter. Furthermore, the presence of thousands of microchannels in the cross-section of YSZ hollow fibre also increases the geometric surface area of this ceramic substrate, which is useful for the dispersion of catalyst. In addition, the support length as short as 10cm can be used to develop the CHFMR suitable for the small-scale of on-board H2 generation. Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of the cross-section of CHFMR and the distribution of reactants in the YSZ hollow fibre. The 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst [24], selected for the ESR reaction, is dispersed onto the inner surface of YSZ hollow fibre using the sol–gel Pechini method. The evaporated mixture of reactants is fed to the lumen of YSZ hollow fibre and owing to the high flow rate of gas carrier, the reactant mixture enters the finger-like structure through its narrow opening. The ESR reaction occurs in the conical microchannels and the products are forced to diffuse out to the lumen as more reactant enters into this reaction zone. Fig. 1b shows the possible arrangement of CHFMR in a square-shaped module. In principle, hollow fibre configuration enables a direct scaling up in which the number of CHFMR can be easily determined based on the production rate of single unit CHFMR. The present article discusses the use of asymmetric (YSZ) hollow fibre as a microreactor substrate for the ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and the possibility of this ceramic hollow fibre to be used in the portable devices application. Although, the concept of CHFMR has been proposed in early study by Garcia-Garcia et al. [23], this work emphasizes on the use of a different ceramic substrate, which is YSZ hollow, and using the ESR to generate H2 for the fuel cell application. This work does not also use palladium membrane to separate H2 from reaction zone as proposed by Rahman et al. in their study [25] because the amount of CO2 produced in this system is less and would not affect the overall performance of fuel cell. It should be noted that this substrate that has been used for the ESR is obtained from the work of Wei et al.[26]. However, Wei et al. focused on the fabrication of YSZ hollow fibre and carried out a number of characterisations on this ceramic hollow fibre [26]. 2 Experimental In this study, YSZ hollow fibre which was prepared using the dry-jet wet spinning technique followed by the sintering process was used as a microreactor substrate for the 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst in the development of the CHFMR [26]. The fabrication procedure of the CHFMR was discussed in detail elsewhere [23,25]. The impregnation of 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalysts into the finger-like region was carried out using the sol–gel Pechini method and it can be found elsewhere [23]. Before the catalyst impregnation process, YSZ hollow fibres were wrapped with the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape to avoid a catalyst deposition on their outer surface. A homogeneous catalyst solution was injected into the lumen of YSZ hollow fibres using a glass pipette. This process was repeated a number of times until finger-like voids were considered totally filled with the solution. The YSZ hollow fibres impregnated with the catalyst solution were dried in an oven (Salvislab Thermocenter) at 60°C for 24h. The drying process was continued at 115°C for 2h. The YSZ hollow fibres, with xerogel formed during the drying process, were calcined in tubular furnace (Vecstar Furnaces, VCTF/SP) at 400°C in a 50cm3 min−1 flowing air for 1h. The amount of catalyst impregnated inside the inner surface of YSZ hollow fibres was determined by measuring the weight of YSZ hollow fibres before and after the deposition and calcination steps. The catalytic activity tests for the ESR reaction were carried out in the fixed-bed reactor and the CHFMR under atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 350°C to 500°C. Prior to catalytic activity tests, the 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst was reduced in situ using a 30mlmin−1 of pure H2 at 400°C for an hour. The ethanol molar flow rate was kept constant at 6.24×10−5 molmin−1, with EtOH/H2O feed molar ratio of 1/5. A gas carrier with flow rate of 56mlmin−1 was used to deliver an evaporated mixture into the fixed-bed and CHFMR. The amounts of catalyst in 2, 4 and 8units of CHFMR were 5mg, 12mg and 18mg, respectively. The reaction zone was approximately 10cm in the centre of the YSZ hollow fibre. Three different amounts of 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst (5.7mg, 13.5mg and 100.0mg) were used in the catalytic activity tests using the fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst was mixed with 1.5g of 100μm YSZ particles before being packed into a 6mm ID ceramic tube. The packed-bed length was approximately 30mm and the pressure drop across the bed was negligible. The concentrations of the products were measured using a thermal conductive detector (TCD) gas chromatography (Varian-3900) and the product flow rates were measured using a bubble flow meter. 3 Results and discussion The tubular shape of the YSZ hollow fibres, with 0.1cm OD and 10cm length, has been used in the development of CHFMR for the ESR reaction, as shown in the photographic image of Fig. 2a. The proposed length of ceramic hollow fibre for this system is only 10cm. The use of long microreactor length is not favourable for most microreactor applications because it will reduce the selectivity of catalytic reaction in the microreactor [27]. In addition, the use of short hollow fibre enables the microreactor from being the possibility of break during the assembling of the reactor. The structure and morphology of the cross-section of the YSZ hollow fibres were studied using the SEM, as shown in Fig. 2b. As can be seen, the cross-section of the YSZ hollow fibres consists of 80% large finger-like structure originated from inner region and the rest is occupied by the sponge-like region and small finger-like structure originated from the outer-region. The 80% large finger-like region is made up of hundreds of conical microchannels which are distributed perpendicularly to the lumen of YSZ hollow fibre. The structural feature of the microchannels, truncated cone with a conical circular base between 10μm and 50μm and a total length of 200μm provides high geometric surface area for the catalyst impregnation process, enhancing the catalytic activities of the 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst. Apart from being a microreactor, the conical microchannel of the finger-like structure has a similar shape to the diverging micromixer studied by Fu and Pan [28]. The presence of diverging micromixers enhances the diffusion/mixing process between ethanol and water vapour due the deceleration of liquid flow at the entrance of finger-like structure. A sudden change of flow from high (in the lumen) to low (finger-like opening) flow rate contributes to strong deformation on liquid interfaces in the conical microchannel, which consequently improves the diffusion/mixing process [29]. Further looking at Fig. 2b, the outer layer of the YSZ hollow fibre consists of small finger-like regions and a sponge layer with a thickness ranging from 3μm to 6μm. In the development of membrane microreactor, this sponge layer can be used as an exceptional substrate onto which Pd/Ag membrane can be deposited [25]. However, in the application of CHFMR for on-board H2 generation, the thin-skin layer can be further densified, producing a gas-tight layer which eliminates the requirement of a high temperature sealant on the outer layer [30]. Fig. 2c and d shows a uniform distribution of Ce and Ni ions on the cross section of the YSZ hollow fibre, respectively. These images suggest that the impregnation of the 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst onto the inner walls of both large and small finger-like regions was successfully carried out using the sol–gel Pechini method. The catalyst impregnation process started from the lumen of the YSZ hollow fibre, in which the catalyst solution could diffuse through the narrow opening of the conical microchannels due to the capillary force and ended in the outer-layer. The sol–gel Pechini method enabled not only a uniform dispersion of the catalyst on the finger-like regions but also produced the ESR catalyst with higher surface area. The specific surface area of YSZ hollow fibre also increased from 0.57 to 1.40m2 g−1 after the catalyst impregnation process. The presence of thin layer of 10wt.%NiO/MgO–CeO2 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel Pechini method increases the specific surface area of YSZ hollow fibre. The advantages of the CHFMR for on-board H2 generation can be illustrated based on comparative catalytic studies that were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor and the CHFMR shown in Fig. 3 . The flow rate of liquid reactants was kept constant at 0.01mlmin−1 and the highest flow rate of H2 can be obtained was 9.2mlmin−1 if the selectivity of H2 reaches 100%. Fig. 3a shows the H2 flow rate increased with numbers of CHFMR used. The difference between the flow rate of H2 produced became significant after 450°C and the highest flow rate of H2 produced at 510°C, approximately 8.9mlmin−1 when 8units of the CHFMR was used. An increase in the production of H2 was associated with an increase in the amount of 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst involved in the ESR reaction. These findings are also in agreement with numerous studies demonstrating that mixed oxides used for the ESR reaction show their significant catalytic activities when the reaction temperature is above 400°C [31–33]. Fig. 3b shows H2 flow rate produced during the ESR reaction carried out in the fixed-bed reactors. In the preparation of these fixed-bed reactors, a specific amount of 10wt.%Ni/MgO–CeO2 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel Pechini method was mixed with an inert material before being packed in a tubular tube. An increase in the amount of catalyst ranging from 5mg to 13mg demonstrated an insignificant increase in the amount of H2 produced, which was different from its hollow fibre substrate counterpart. As the amount of catalyst was increased to 100mg, the amount H2 produced increased significantly with reaction temperatures. Typically, a number of researchers study the catalytic activities of their novel catalysts using catalyst amounts up to 100mg to obtain significant ethanol conversion and/or H2 production [24,34,35]. This study shows that H2 produced in 8units of CHFMRs, which have only 18mg, is relatively similar to that produced in a fixed-bed reactor. It is interesting to note that the use of CHFMR enables effective utilisation of catalyst, i.e. the amount of catalyst used is 5–6 times less compared to the fixed-bed reactor. Furthermore, a uniform distribution of the catalyst into the microchannels of the asymmetric YSZ hollow fibre increases the catalytic surface to volume ratio and improves the mass transfer and the mixing process of the reactants during the ESR reaction. It is interesting to note that the coke deposition was absent throughout the catalytic activity tests due to the use of magnesium, which is alkaline earth metal, during synthesis of catalyst using the sol–gel Pechini method. The product composition has a small amount of CH4 which is less than 4%. Fig. 3c shows a linear relationship between the amounts of H2 produced at 410°C and 510°C as the number of CHFMR was increased in a testing module. These findings are in agreement with a general consensus which states that hollow fibre configuration can be directly scaled-up to large production scales. From Fig. 3, H2 was produced at a rate of 8.9mlmin−1 at 510°C when 8units of CHFMR were used for the ESR reaction. According to Son et al., 888mlmin−1 H2 is required to enable the PEMFC to produce 35W of electricity which is sufficient for a laptop application [8]. Based on a direct scale-up, the total number of the CHFMR required for producing 888mlmin−1 of H2 is 800units, using 1.00mlmin−1 of EtOH/H2O mixture with feed molar ratio of 1/5 as reactants. Based on these calculations and the diameter of single substrate, it can be estimated that a 2.9cm×2.9cm×10cm square module can be used to assemble 800units of the CHFMR. In the actual system, it is expected that the dilution would not be a problem due to high flow rate of reactant involved in the system. Similar to a system proposed/used by Son et al. [8], this microreformer can be coupled with a PROX system to eliminate trace amount of CO and CH4 in the product so that the product of the microreformer does not reduce the overall performance of fuel cell in portable devices. In the development of powering devices for portable applications such as laptop, an operating temperature for a reformer should be lowered ranging from 200°C to 400°C [8]. The ESR reaction requires a slightly higher temperature for a complete conversion of ethanol and higher selectivity of H2. Continuous researches on development of catalyst for the ESR reaction have been done by numerous researchers due to the advantages of ethanol over methanol as a fuel for most reformers in H2 production and it is likely that a low-temperature catalyst for the ESR reaction can be produced in the near future. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, this study shows that an asymmetric yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) hollow fibre is an exceptional substrate to be used for the CHFMR in the development of on-board H2 generation. The finger-like structure of YSZ hollow fibres can be regarded as a hundreds of conical microchannels which increase the catalytic surface to volume ratio and improve the heat and mass transfer, as well as the mixing of the gases during the reaction. A uniform distribution of catalyst on the wall of finger-like structure can be obtained using the sol–gel Pechini method. An excellent catalyst utilisation in the CHFMR enables a small quantity of catalyst to be used for the ESR reaction. The CHFMR can be directly scaled-up to large production scales. About 800units of the CHFMR with a feed (mixture ethanol and water) flow rate of 1.00mlmin−1 are required to produce sufficient amount of H2 to generate 35W of electricity.
