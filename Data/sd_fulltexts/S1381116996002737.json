SOCHAt AND T. T. SOONG Department of Civil Engineering, State University of Neu, York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14620, U.S.A. (Received 26 September 1990, and in final form 18 April 1991) The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between sensitivity analysis and equivalent linearization as applied to the study of non-linear stochastic systems. For an oscillator with an odd order polynomial stiffness and Gaussian white noise excitation, we consider four approximate procedures in which the operation of equivalent linearization, calculation of sensitivity and calculation of moment equations are taken into account in different orders. An example is given to compare the sensitivity characteristics so obtained with the exact result. 1. INTRODUCTION Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in the study of the response of stochastic systems. This approach has been developed recently by many authors; for instance, references [1-6, 9-15]. A review of these works can be found in a survey paper by Socha [I1]. The basic idea of this technique is to differentiate the governing stochastic differential equations with respect to a constant parameter and to find desirable characteristics using one of the closure techniques. Then we obtain so-called output sensitivity measures [10]. Another possibility is first to find the moment equations and then to differentiate them with respect to a parameter. As it was shown in reference [9], both approaches give the same result in the case of linear systems with white noise excitations. However, this is not true for general non-linear cases [ 10], indicating that the operations of equivalent linearization, derivation of sensitivity equations and derivation of moment equations using one of the closure techniques are not commutative for non-linear systems. In this paper, we consider four procedures in which these operations are performed in different orders. They are as follows: (a) procedure LSM-equivalent linearization followed by sensitivity equation followed by moment equations; (b) procedure SLM-sensitivity equations followed by equivalent linearization followed by moment equations; (c) procedure MS-moment equations followed by sensitivity equations; (d) procedure SMsensitivity equations followed by moment equations. To obtain moment equations for stationary solutions in cases (c) and (d), we will apply the Gaussian closure technique. Results are derived for oscillators with odd order stiffness polynomials and Gaussian white noise excitation. It is shown that, for this class of nonlinear systems, all four procedures give the same result. t On leave from the Institute of Transport, Silesian Technical University, Katowice, Poland. 79 0022-460X/92/130079+ 19 $03.00/0 1992 Academic Press Limited L. SOCHA AND T. T. SOONG 2. MATHEMATICAL MODEL We consider a non-linear oscillator with white noise excitation given by mz,+2hx,+kx,+f,(x,)=~(t), x,(to)=x,o, x,(to)=xzo, (1) where m, h and k are the mass, damping and stiffness coefficient, respectively, f, (x,) is a non-linear function of xj, 4(t) is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and intensity 80 and x,o and xzo are initial conditions. We assume that N f(x)= ~ En-,xzn-l' n=2 where s; (i=1, . . . , N-1) are positive constants. Transforming system (1) into the vector form dx=[Ax+B(x)]dt+Gd4, x(to)=xo, where (2) (3) X1 I IX2 A=[ 0 1 , B(x)_ 0 ~ G=[ 0 , x<'_ xlo ' azi azzJ f(xi)J $iJ CxzoJ xz=x1 5 az1 =-(klm), azz=-(2h/m), f(xi)=-(.iOxOlm), 8, =1/m, (4) we calculate the sensitivity equations, which are as follows: (a) with respect to the parameter h, I dt AYI+As,x+BsOx, Y ),Y'(4)=0; and (b) with respect to the parameter k, d n dt Ayr' +Aszx+Bsz(x, Y'), y\"(to)=0, where (5) (6) YI ~1 r/ z~yr ~z`~ ASS , =[o0 al], AA = 01 Bsi(x~Y`)=[bOxOy')I Bsz(x~Y\")=Cbz(xOYn)y Y'l-axilah~ YZ=axZ/ah, y;'=ax,/ak, yz=z/, a,=-2/m, a2=-1/M, N-2 bi(xmY')=- 2: (2n-1)sn-,xzn yi~ n=2 N bz(xi,Y'r)=- y_ (2n-1)sn_,xzn zYir. n=2 (8) (9) NON-LINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 81 The first and second order moment equations for system (3) have the form dm/dt=Am+C, (m, h, m(tv)=mo, (10) dA' -=Arffv+C2(m,.,Yv)+DI, '*'v(tv)=.Y\"~' (11) dt where 7T ~p 7 m = [ml ~ m21v = [.1G 1 I X'12 , -*522JT' my = [m10 , m20]T, ~*o=[.folI ~ .*9012~ ~*0o221T' ml =E[x11, m2=E[x2J, ~,Y11 =ELxl~ A~12=E[xj, x2J, X22=E[xz~ mlo=E[xlo], m2o=E[x201, ~e,,=E[(xlo)2], ]2 =D[x10I x2o)i '*\"o2z = E[(x20)2], 0 2 0 ] _ 0 A,-= a2, a22 1 , C, (m, f' , L(m,, Yvii)10 2a2, 2a22 0 C2(m2, l'v) = CAM, -(fv) CAM, .'*0fv) __ _ cl(ml,.Yv,,)=E[l(xl)h C2(m,~)=E[f(xl)xl1, C3(m>1yv)=E[f(x1)x2l(12) Since C,(m2, .rv has the form CI(mI, vii)=-W(M1' -100v1i) ml, (13) where W(m,,v is a polynomial, the stationary solution of equation (10) is therefore equal zero, i.e., m(oo)=0, and the functions c2 and C3 reduce in this case to N C2(~v) (2n 1)iicn_1(E[xij)n> (14) n=2 N C3(Or e o) I (2n 1)!!gn_1(E[x)n lE[xl, x2](15) n=2 The derivation of equalities (14) and (15) follows from properties of Gaussian random variables (see, for instance, references [7, 8] and Appendix equations (A40, A42)). As mentioned in the introduction, we will compare the four procedures of sensitivity analysis of the response of system (1). To be derived in all procedures are equations for derivatives 7r/, r/, x/ and r/, where ar and ar are the variances of the displacement and the velocity, respectively. 3. PROCEDURE LSM Applying equivalent linearization to system (3), we obtain dx=AL,xdt+Gd4, x(to)=xo, (16) 82 L. SOCHA AND T. T.

(20) m n=2 Upon rewriting equations (16) and (18) and also equations (16) and (19) in vector form, we have dz'=.d;z' tit+9 d~, z'(to)=zo, (21) where x, x, 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 x2 2 - x2 k2 a22 0 0 _ yk2 a22 0 0 _, z z y.s/I0 0 0 1 S12 0 0 0 1 ' Y2 Y2 Y' Y2 k2 a22 Y3 0 k2 a22 4 = [0, 8> > 0, O]T, zo = [xiO, x2o , 0, O]T.

In the above, l'fk is an element of matrix 1\"'=E[zYT]. Matrix .1,; and vector B,- are given in the Appendix. Let us remark that coefficients k2, y, and y3 depend on the first and second moments of the solution of equation (21). If we restrict our considerations to the stationary case, then the solutions can be found from the system of non-linear algebraic equations obtained NON-LINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 83 from equations (23) and (24) by equating their left sides to zero. In this case, m'(o0)=0, i=1, 2. For example, the system of algebraic equations for i=1 has the form - I - 1 52 = 0, 1 2 21 - I - I F 12 = 0, k2l 11 + a221 12 + 1 22 0, 2k2F 12 + 2a221 22 + (25--27) r114+1- 23=0, r24+k2r13+a22r23=0, 2F34=0, (28-30) Y,r;, + Y2ri2+k2r;3+a22ri4+rz4=0, (31) 'Ylr112+Y2r22+k2F23+a22rl24+k2r+a22I (32) Ylr i3+ Y2r23+kzr33+a22r34+r=0, (33) Yiri4+Y2ri4+k2r34+a22r=0, (34) where S2= Sm2. (35) The coefficient k2 and variables rand 1-22 can be calculated separately from equations (25)-(27). We find that ri2=0i rz2=-S2/2a12=-k2rii > (36) where k2 is defined by equation (17). Hence, it follows that r;, satisfies the non-linear algebraic equation N 52 (2n-l)!!sn_j(r)n+a2ir,1,+-=0. (37) n=2 2a22 The solution of equation (37) cannot be found analytically in the general case. However, for the particular case in which N= 2 (Duffing oscillator), the coefficient k2 and the solution r;, =E[x have the forms 21 k2=a21-3sr,1, r=Ca2i+ (a22-6s S JI6s.

It is also shown that, if we assume that the coefficients k3 and k4 are equal, the derivations [x;]/, [x2]/, [x;]/ and [x2J/ are the same as the coefficients obtained by procedure LSM. 5. PROCEDURE MS We have derived in section 2 the moment equations for system (3) in closed form using the Gaussian closure technique. To obtain moment sensitivity equations, we differentiate moment equations (10) and (11) as follows: (a) with respect to h, dv'/dt=Av'+As,m+Hi, v'(to)=0, (49) du'/dt=Al-u'+Ar,*H2, u'(to)=0, (50) where v'= /, u'= ,Y, Hi '= ;/, where C; is defined by equation (12), and 0 0 0 Ar,= 0 a, 0 , A,, =[00 0~ (51) 0 all 0 0 2a, and (b) with respect to k, dvZ/dt=AvZ+A,szm+H vZ(tj =0, (52) du2/dt=AruZ+Alsz'7XfH2, u2(to)=0, (53) where v' = 8m/, u2 = a /, H? = aC/8k, 0 0 0 As2=CO 0J, A17,2= aZ 0 0 . (54) a2 0 10 2a20 We transform equations (10) and (49), (11) and (50), (10) and (52) and (11) and (53) into the vector form and consider only the stationary case. From equations (10) and (49), and also equations (10) and (52), it follows that in the stationary case m(00)=0 and v'(oo) = 0, i =1, 2. Solving the algebraic equations obtained from equations (11) and (50) and also from equations (11) and (53), we find that [x;]/=u [x2]/=u3, OE[x/=ui, [xz]/=u3 are the same as the coefficients obtained using procedure LSM. 6. PROCEDURE SM This last procedure has been partially considered in section 4, where we have transformed the state equation (3) and the output sensitivity equations (5) and (6) into the vector form 86 L. SOCHA AND T. T. SOONG (43). Now, instead of linearization, we use Gaussian closure technique to obtain the first and second order moment equations. They take the forms dm'/dt=.;m'+P'(m', r;,), m'(to)=m (55) dr',,/dt=Arrv+Ye',(m', r',)+Br, r',,(to)=r\" (56) where m'=E[z'], r;,=[r, ri2~ ri2~ ri3~ ri3, r`33,1 1 r24,1 `sa, rT> mo-E[Zo], ro=[E[x i0], E[x10, x20], \"[x20]e 0, O, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]T. rj'k is an element of the matrix r ` = E[z T ] and P`(m`, r;,)=E[~;(z~)]=.~ `(m`, r;,)m'. (57) The matrices Ar, and vectors -yf;, and Br are defined in the Appendix. Here the last equality follows from properties of Gaussian variables. F'(m', r;,) is a 4 x 4 matrix, the elements of which are polynomials of components of vectors m' and r;,. From equations (55) and (57), it follows that the stationary solution is m'(oo)=0, and further calculations show that the relations for [x/, jxZ]/, [x/ and [x22]/ for the stationary solution are the same as the corresponding ones obtained using procedure LSM. 7. EXAMPLE As an example, consider the Dufng equation m.z+2h.z+kx+sx3=(t). (58) As it was shown all the procedures give the same result in the stationary case, i.e., the dependence of the variances of displacement and velocity on the change of damping and stiffness have the forms (41) and (42), i.e., aX2] 52 X2] 52 E[ 1 )2 _r2 aE[ 2 72 )21 (59) ah 2(a22 (a21-6EF,,)' Oh (a22 a a[ki]=(m r~(a21-6.-r,1), a k2]=o, (60) where a2i=k/m, a22=-2hlm, Y2=-2/m, S2=Sm2, s2\\ r,, =la2i+ (a2,)2-6s-IJ6&.

It is shown that the reaction rate greatly depends on the nature of the solvent (protic or aprotic) whether the reaction is catalyzed or not. In the case of the catalyzed reaction, Ti-beta is more active and selective than TS-1 for all the solvents. Keywords: Ethylsulfide; Ethylsulfoxide; Oxidation; Hydrogen peroxide; Titanosilicalites 1.

H202 has taken new importance in recent years, because of its environmental implication, water being the only chemical by-product of oxidation reactions; moreover, it is less expensive and more accessible than the other oxidizing agents, such as peracids or hydroperoxides. The use of transition-metal (Ti, Mo, Fe, V, W, Re, Ru) complexes as active catalysts for the selective oxidation of thioethers by H202 in homogeneous conditions has been reported by various authors [2-11]. It has been shown more recently that some of these metals (Ti, V), incorporated in a zeolitic framework are able to catalyse such an oxidation reaction [ 12,13]. The application of such transition metal-containing zeolites in the oxidation of various organic substrates, i.e. alkanes, alkenes, phenols, amines, sulfides [12,14-16], constitutes a significant 500 V. Hulea, P. Moreau /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 499-505 breakthrough in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The structure of the zeolite (MFI, BEA, MEL) plays an important role in the oxidation processes [17-20], but the nature of the solvent can also affect the reaction [21,22]. Nevertheless, systematic studies on the effect of the solvent in the oxidation reactions of organic substrates by HZOZ using Ti- (or V-) containing zeolites as catalysts are not reported. The purpose of the present study is to explore the influence of various solvents in the sulfoxidation of thioethers by hydrogen peroxide using Ti-beta and TS-1 as catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Ethyl sulfide (98%) from Aldrich was used as supplied. Hydrogen peroxide (aqueous solution 31 wt%) was obtained from Prolabo. Methanol, analytical grade (SDS), ethanol, analytical grade (SDS), tert-butanol, HPLC grade (Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile, 99% (Aldrich), acetone, HPLC grade (Aldrich) and tetrahydrofuran, analytical grade (SDS) were used as solvents. 2.2. Catalysts TS-1 and Ti-beta, with structure MFI and BEA, respectively, have been used as catalysts. The composition of the catalysts was Ti/(Ti + Si) = 0.011 and 0.008 for TS-1 and Ti-beta, respectively. Crystal size as determined by scanning electron microscopy (Cambridge Stereocan 260) was 0.1 Am for TS-1 isometric crystals and 0.4 Am for zeolite beta spheroidal grains. The presence of an absorption band corresponding at 48 000 cm-' in DR-UV-vis spectra [13] indicates that Ti (IV) is incorporated in the framework of molecule sieves. No band corresponding to segregated Ti02 particles was found to be present in this spectra. 2.3. Catalytic experiments The catalytic sulfoxidation of ethyl sulfide with hydrogen peroxide was carried out in a glass flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer and a condenser. In a typical experiment, TS-1 (40 mg) or Ti-beta (50 mg) was stirred with sulfide (2 mmol), the solvent (10 ml), and H202 (2 mmol) at a constant temperature. Samples were periodically collected and analyzed by GC in a capillary column (Methyl Silicone Gum, 25 m X 0.2 mm X 0.33 Am film thickness). The hydrogen peroxide was measured by standard iodometric titration. 3. Results and discussion A previous study [ 13] concerning the oxidation of various alkyl and arylsulfides by H 202 over Ti-beta and TS-1 in alcoholic solvents led us to some interesting remarks: the reactivity of thioethers is in agreement with both the nucleophilic character of the sulfur atom (alkylsulfides are more easily oxidized than arylsulfides) and their molecular size: Et 2 S > Prz S > Allyl Z S > MePhS > Ph2S; Ti-beta is more active than TS-1 in the sul foxidation of hindered molecules; an effect of the nature of the alcohol is observed for both TS-1 and Ti-beta: MeOH > t-BuOH. We present here the results obtained in the study of the sulfoxidation of ethyl sulfide by H202 in the presence of various solvents. Ethyl sulfide has been chosen as a model molecule in order to avoid steric constraints due to the substrate. Methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and t-butanol (t-BuOH) were used as protic solvents, and acetonitrile (MeCN), acetone (MeCOMe) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were used as aprotic solvents. The concentration of both ethyl sulfide and hydrogen peroxide was 0.19 M in all the solvents, and the reaction temperature was 303 K. The reaction has first V. Hulea, P. Moreau/ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 499-505 been studied without any catalyst, and then with TS-1 and Ti-beta as catalysts, respectively. 3.1. Ethyl sulfide oxidation by HZOZ without catalyst Fig. 1 shows the ethyl sulfide conversion versus time for all the solvents used, under conditions described above. The results obtained confirm first that, as already reported [23,24], alkylsulfides can be oxidized with H 202 under mild conditions, even in the absence of any catalyst. Secondly, they show that ethyl sulfide conversion highly depends on the nature of the solvent: the protic solvents, methanol and ethanol, favor the oxidation reaction, whereas, in aprotic solvents acetone and THF, the reaction is very slow. For each type of solvent (protic and aprotic), a direct correlation between the ethyl sulfide conversion and dielectric constant of the solvents is observed (Table 1), but this correlation is not applicable if we consider all the solvents together: the initial rates obtained for the conversion in acetonitrile and acetone are not as high as it should be, taking into account the high dielectric constant of these solvents compared with those of methanol and ethanol, re- spectively.

A good correlation between the initial rate of the oxidation reaction, ro, and the molar transition energy is obtained for all the solvents studied. The molar transition energy, ET(30), is an empirical parameter of the solvent polarity, which is calculated from spectroscopic measurements, according to [26,27]. Fig. 2 shows the linear dependance between log ro and this parameter.

Two mechanisms are possible for the cleavage of the peroxide bond in the oxygen transfer to the organic substrate [28): - an hotnolytic process -ZO~+ OY~ V - an heterolytic process ZOnoY~zo++- The heterolytic process is energetically favored, particularly in the presence of a nucleophilic reagent (Nu:). In this case, the heterolytic reaction is bimolecular, bringing up a pair of electrons to the oxygen which is losing grip on the O-O bonding electrons (Scheme 1). In polar solvents the heterolytic mechanism, possibly aided by structural factors, is certainly the dominant process, where the partially or totally ionic intermediates are stabilized by the solvent. The dependence between the initial rate of the oxidation reaction and a parameter directly connected to the polarity of the solvent confirms such an assumption. Moreover, if the solvent is hydroxylic (ROH), it may participate, as a third molecule, to the transition state in transferring a proton to the leaving group in a cyclic process [28]. Such a possible transition state for the system Et2SHZOZ is shown by Scheme 2. 3.2. Ethyl sulfide oxidation by H202 over Ticontaining zeolites 3.2.1.

Figs. 3 and 4 show the conversion of ethyl sulfide versus time for TS-1 and Ti-beta respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the use of TS-1 as catalyst leads to a higher conversion of the thioether, whatever the solvent. The order of efficiency of the solvents is exactly the same as that observed without catalyst: MeOH > EtOH > MeCN > tBuOH > MeCOMe > THF. The catalytic activity of Ti-beta (Fig. 4) is higher than that of TS-1 for all the solvents, but the results obtained regarding the behavior of each solvent are significantly different. Thus, it can be seen that, for the three protic solvents, conversions of ethyl sulfide are very similar (MeOH = EtOH = t-BuOH) and much higher than those obtained in aprotic solvents.

It is known that in such a complex the transition metal increases the electrophilicity of the peroxydic oxygen atom, which makes the nucleophilic attack of organic substrate easier. The coordination of a erotic solvent to the active site leads to a stabilization of this intermediate, and thus favors this type of mechanism. The results obtained over the Ti-beta catalyst for ROH type solvents (Fig. 4), i.e. MeOH = EtOH .-~. t-BuOH, show that, due to the Ti-active species, the influence of the nature of the solvents becomes smaller, compared with the noncatalytic reaction (Fig. 1) where MeOH > EtOH t-BuOH. The latter order of efficiency of alcoholic solvents is found for the oxidation reaction over TS-1 (Fig. 3). Assuming that the oxidation mechanism of ethyl sulfide by H20z 503 is similar for both TS-1 and Ti-Beta, such results confirm that small pore zeolites, containing Ti, like TS-1, lead to a significant transition-state shape selectivity effect. If we consider the results obtained over the Ti-beta zeolite in aprotic solvents, Fig. 4 shows a relatively slow conversion of ethyl sulfide in THF and MeCOMe, but a high conversion using MeCN as a solvent. Such a behavior could be explained by a possible addition reaction of hydrogen peroxide to acetonitrile, leading to the peroxyimidic acid, R-C(=NH)-O-O-H, which is known to be an active oxidant agent towards various organic substrates [29-31]. 3.2.2. Selectivity The oxidation of a thioether can yield either the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone, or both, depending on the reaction conditions (Eq. (1)). For the ethyl sulfide oxidation, the selectivity in ethyl sulfide depends on both the catalyst type (TS-1 < Ti-beta) and the solvent nature MeOH EtOH > MeCN > THF (Table 2). Moreover, as already observed for the sulfoxidation of various thioethers under the same conditions [13], a fast and high conversion (high ro) leads to a high selectivity in sulfoxide, as for example in methanol and ethanol. In order to establish whether the nature of the solvent can modify the rate ratios between the two steps of the sulfoxidation reaction (Eq. (1)) and thus the selectivity, the kinetics of the oxidation reaction of ethyl sulfide has been Table 2 The initial rate and selectivity in sulfoxide for Et, S sulfoxidation with Hz02 using Ti-containing zeolites a - Solvent ro X 105 (mol I- I s-1) S1so b (%) TS-1 Ti-beta TS-1 Ti-beta g MeOH 25.66 35.00 98.1 98.5 EtOH 9.41 35.50 96.2 98.5 t-BuOH 3.18 29.5 93.8 96.8 MeCN 4.85 11.92 94.7 94.9 Si0- Ti 0 - H MeCOMe 2.13 4.30 93.4 97.2 Si0/ ~ \\ O~ THF 1.33 3.75 78.2 92.8 osi Scheme 3.

The results obtained lead to the following remarks and comments: 1. for a given solvent, the rate of formation of the sulfoxide (dotted lines in Fig. 5) is higher when an excess of H202 is used compared with the stoichiometric conditions (Fig. 4); 2. as expected, the rate of formation of the sulfone (continuous lines) is lower than that of formation of the sulfoxide (dotted lines), whatever the solvent; 3. the order of efficiency of the solvents is the same for the two steps: EtOH MeCN > THF. Considering this latter order, the lower selectivity in sulfoxide observed in THF and MeCN compared with EtOH (Table 2) can be attributed only to the lower reaction rate of the first step and not to a favorable effect of these solvents in the second step. 4. Conclusion The oxidation reaction of ethylsulfide by hy- drogen peroxide has been investigated in vari ous organic solvents. It has first been shown V. Hulea, P. Moreau /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 499-SOS that this reaction can be carried out without catalyst, in mild conditions, and that the reaction rate greatly depends on the nature of the solvent. A linear relation between log ro and an empirical parameter of the solvent polarity has been found. Ti-containing zeolites are very active as catalysts for this reaction; in all the solvents used, the activity and selectivity of Ti-beta are higher than those of TS-1. Such a difference is due to a shape-selectivity effect of the medium-pore zeolite TS-1 compared with the large pore structure of Ti-beta. In the case of TS-1, the order of efficiency of the solvents is the same as that observed without catalyst: MeOH > EtOH > MeCN > t-BuOH > MeOMe > THF, whereas, over Ti-beta, the conversion of ethylsulfide is very similar in all the protic solvents, and much higher than that obtained in apotric solvents.

CONCLUDING REMARKS We have considered four approximate procedures in which the operation of equivalent linearization, calculation of sensitivity and calculation of moment equations are taken into NON-LINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 89 account in different orders. It is shown that, similar to linear systems [9], all these procedures give the same result for a relatively wide class of non-linear oscillators. It includes the stiffness force in the form of odd order polynomials and with Gaussian stationary white noise excitations. Such representation give approximation of any odd function. It follows from the fact that if we represent an odd functionfix) in the basis of orthogonal Hermite polynomials Hk(x), i.e., ckHk(x), (66) k=0 then all even order coefficients cz, are equal to zero.

(A5) Substituting N 1-1 1 1 k2 - X2])n - I 12~0, r23+F,4=0, = a2l 1] (2n - I )!! _-, - I (E[ I n=2 and N YI -- I 2(n-1)(2n-1)!lEn_ I(E[x21)n 2E[xlyi] n=2 into equation (AS), we obtain N - 2(n- 1) (2n- 1)It-1(E[xi])n-Ir13+221r n=2 N - Y_ 2(2n-1P En_1(E[xi] )n Ir13=0, (A6) n=2 where I- i 3 = E[x1Yi]. Hence, relations (39) follow from equations (A4)-(A6). Similar to the previous case, in order to obtain the quantities [x;]/ and [x2]/ in the stationary case, we equate the system of equations (23) and (24) to zero for i=2 and we find that m2(oo)=0 and, instead of equations (25)-(34), we solve the following system of equations: 2r=0, k2r+a22r+r21=0, 2k2r+2a221\"22+52=0, (A7-A9) rjq+r23=0, r24+k2r+a22~23=0, 234=0, (A10--A12) Y3r +k2r13+a22r1a+r z4=0, Y3r12+k2r23+2a22~24+k2F14=0, (A13, A14) Y3rj3+k2r33+a22F34+r44=0, Y3r+k2r 34+a22r0. (A15, A16) One can observe that equations (A7)-(All) are the same as equations (25)-(30). Therefore, rig=ri2~ rz2=rz2, ril=ri1. (A17) Substituting r = 0 and r + r 23 = 0 into equation (A 14), we find r24=o. (A18) Adding equations (A11) and (A13) and substituting 1-'24=0 and rZ3=0, we obtain 1 + 2k2r = 0, (A 19) where N Y3=- 1 - 2(n-1)(2n-1)it6n-1(\"lx1J)n 2E[x1Yi'I, m n=2 N k2=a21 ~, (2n 1)Ilan-1(E[xi])n-1. n=2 Hence, relations (40) follow from equation (A18). 92 L. SOCHA AND T. T. SOONG PROCEDURE SLM First, we outline the derivation of coefficients k k,'4, k5 and kb. Differentiating the meansquare error 1, given by equation (47), i.e., 11 -[a2ixi +j(x,)-k3x,]2+[a1X2+a2iY1 +b,(x, , y')-k4, -ksxz-k4y,]2, (A20) with respect to coefficients k3, k ks and kb and equating these values to zero, we obtain 1 al, _ _ 2 3 E[f(x,)x,]-az,E[x;]+k3E[x=0, (A21) 1 oil --a2jE[Yi]-E[bi(xi ,Y')Yi]-aiE[xz,Yl]+k6EIxiYi]+ksE[xzyi]+kaEYi 2 4 ]=0, (A22) 1 al, _-a2jE[xZy,]-E[b,(x,,Y')xz]-a,E[x2]+k6E[xixz]+k5E[x2]+kaE[xz,YI]=0, 2 s (A23) I al, --a21Ejx,y1]-E[b,(x,, y)x,]-a,E[xIx2]+k6E[x+k5E[xIx2]+k4E[x,y,]=0. 2 6 (A24) In order to solve this system of algebraic equations, we add the moment equations for the linearized system dE[xl]/dt=E[x2], dE[x2]/dt=k3E[x,]+a2zE[xz], dE[y,]/dt=E[yz], (A25-A27) dE[y2]/dt=k6E[x,]+k5E[xz]+k4E[y,]+az2E[yz], dE[x;]/dt=2E[x,xZ], (A28, A29) dE[x, x2]/dt = E[x2] + k3EIx;] + a22E[x, x2], dE[x2] /dt = 2k3E[x,x2] + 2a22E[xZ] + 82, (A30, A31) dE[xiyi]ldt=E[x?y,]+E[xiYz], dE[x2y,]/dt=E[xzYz]+k3E[xiyi]+aZ2E[xzY,], (A32, A33) dY2] E[ I 1dt=2E[Y1Y21, (A34) dElxIyz]ldt=E[xzyz]+k6E[x+k5E[x,x2]+k4EIx,y,]+aZZE[x,yz], (A35) dE[xzy2]ldt=k3E[x,Yz]+2aZ2E[x2Y2]+k6E[x,x2]+k5E[x2]+k4E[xzYi], (A36) dE[YIYz]ldt=E[Yi]+k6E[xlyi]+ksE[xzyi]+kaE[Yi]+azzE[YIYz], (A37) dY2] 21. E[ 21dl=2k6EIxIY2]+2k5E[xzy2]+2k4E[YIY2]+2a22E[Y2 (A38) NON-LINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 93 Here, we have denoted y;=y;, i=1, 2. In the stationary case, we equate the right sides of equations (A7)-(A20) to zero and obtain E[xi(oo>l =E[x2(00)1=E[Yi(oo)1=E[Y2(1=E[xIx2(OC))1=E[YIY2(cc)1=0. (A39) In order to find the quantities E[ f(x,)x,], E[b,(x, , y~)y,], E[b,(x, , y')x2] and E[b,(x,, y')x,], we use the following properties of Gaussian processes x, v, z with means equal to zero (see, for instance, reference [7]): (a) E[x2n- 1] -0; (A40) (b) E[x2n]=(2n-1)!!(E[x2])n, (2n-1)!!=1-3-5...

(A49) n= 2 2a22 In the stationary case, the algebraic equations obtained from equations (A22)-(A24) and (A32)-(A38) with relations (A39), equations (A45)-(A47) have the form N -a2iE[Yil+ E (2n-1)!!En-i(E[xil)n 2[E[xi]E[Yil+(2n-2)(E[xiyil)21 n=2 - a, E[x2y, ] + k6E[x, y, ] + k5E[x2y i ] + k4E[ y = 0, (A50) N -a2lE[xzy,l+ E (2n-1)!!En_i(E[xil)n 'E[xzyjl -ajE[xil +ksE[xil +k[xzyll =0, n=2 (A51) 94 L.

(A57, A58) This system of non-linear algebraic equations can only be solved numerically. However, if we assume that N k4=k3=a2l- (2n-1)iiEn_~(E[xi])n-'~ (A59) n=2 then we have, from equation (A52), N kb=- (2n-2)(2n-1)ii_rn_i(E[xi])n 2E[xlYl], (A60) n=2 and it follows from equation (A51) that k5=a,. (A61) Equation (A50) is also satisfied for these values of k4, ks and k6. Substituting equations (A59), (A61) and (A53) into equation (A56) gives E[xzY2] = a 1152 /4(a22)2. (A62) Adding equations (A54) and (A55), we obtain 2EIx2Y2] + k6E[x + 2k4E[x, y, ] + a22(E[x, y2] + E[xzy, ]) = 0.

NON-LINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS 95 Now we show the derivation of coefficients k3 , k k2 and kb . Differentiating the meansquare error 12 given by equation (47), i.e., 12=[a2lxi+f(xi)-k3xi]2+[a2xi+a21Y1+b2(xi,Y\")-k6X1-ksx2-k4Y1]2, (A66) with respect to coefficients k3, k4, ks and kb and equating these values to zero, we obtain 1_2__ 2 3 E[f(x,)x,]-a2,E[x+k3E[x=0, (A67) 1 012 j] Yi]=0, i --a21E[Y-E[b2(xi,Y\")Yi]-a2E[xlyi]+ktE[xiyl]+ksE[xzyl]+kaE[ (A68) 1 012 - -a2lE[ y, x2] - E[b2(x, , y')x2] - a2E[x,x2] + k6E[x,x2] + k5E[x2] + k4E[x2y, ] = 0, 2 s (A69) 1 2=-a2jE[x,y,]-E[b2(x,,yx,]-a2E[x;]+k6E[x2]+kSE[x,x2] 2 b +k4E[x,y,]=0. (A70) The moment equations for the linearized system are described by equations (A25)(A38). Similarly, one can show that, in the stationary case, relations (A39), (A48) and (A49) are satisfied and, using the properties of Gaussian processes, equations (A40)(A43), we find that relations (A44)-(A47) are likewise satisfied, i.e., N E[b2(x>>Yf1 )Y I ]=- I (2n-1)!!En_,(E[xi])n 2[E[xl]E[Yi]+(2n-2)(E[xiyi])2], (A71) n=2 N E[b2(x>>Y\")x2]=- E (2n-1)!!s([E[xi])n 'E[xzy,], (A72) n=2 N E[b2(x>>Y\")xI]=- (2n-1)(2n-1)!!En_,(E[x2])n-'E[xlyl].

The oxidation reaction of ethyl sulfide by hydrogen peroxide is investigated in various organic solvents, without catalyst and over Ti-containing zeolites (TS-1 and Ti-beta, respectively) as catalysts. It is shown that the reaction rate greatly depends on the nature of the solvent (protic or aprotic) whether the reaction is catalyzed or not. In the case of the catalyzed reaction, Ti-beta is more active and selective than TS-1 for all the solvents.
