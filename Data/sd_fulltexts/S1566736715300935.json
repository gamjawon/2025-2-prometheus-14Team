Abstract In this study, a core–shell Fe3O4@amine-functionalized graphene (Fe3O4@GON) composite was prepared as a support for the immobilization of Pd nanoparticles. The graphene oxide (GO) shell was aminated by a condensation reaction between GO and a polyamine. The Pd nanoparticles were immobilized on Fe3O4@GON using sonochemical method without additional reducing agents. The prepared Pd/Fe3O4@GON composite was characterized using TEM, XRD, XPS, ICP-OES and EDS. The catalytic activity of Pd/Fe3O4@GON in heterogeneous Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between various aryl iodides and terminal acetylenes was investigated. Graphical abstract Keywords Catalyst Pd nanoparticle Sonogashira cross-coupling Graphene Fe3O4 1 Introduction During the past decade, metal nanoparticles that supported on various materials, including activated carbon [1], polymers [2], alumina [3], metal oxides [4], zeolite [5] and metal-organic frameworks [6] have received considerable attention as catalysts. Iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) are easily accessible magnetic supports for various metal nanoparticles and provide improved recovery and reusability in heterogeneous catalysis [7–9]. Recently, carbon-coated Fe3O4 has attracted the attention of several groups and been extensively used in various applications, because of its superior properties [10–12]. Carbon materials with high surface areas and controllable pore sizes are suitable for the immobilization of metal nanoparticles. In addition, the distribution of nanoparticles on carbon materials can be easily controlled. As a result of these characteristics, the carbon matrix improves the catalytic activity and selectivity [13–14]. Graphene-based materials such as graphene and graphene oxide (GO), which are the most important carbon nanomaterials with one-atom thick structures, have received much attention in catalysis in recent decades, because of their high specific surface areas as well as excellent stabilities, porosities and flexibility [15–18]. Recently, GO has been widely used as a support in the fabrication of metal–graphene nanocomposites for various applications such as catalysts [19], lithium-ion batteries [20], fuel cells [21] and solar cells [22]. The oxygen functional groups on GO provide nucleation sites for metal precursors, and this leads to the formation of metal–graphene nanocomposites. Various metals or metal oxides, including Pd [23], Pt [24], Au [25], SiO2 [26], Fe3O4 [27] and TiO2 [28], can be easily immobilized on GO surfaces. Furthermore, GO can be dispersed in both water and various organic solvents, which enables easy handling and substitution of its oxygen functional groups, leading to enhanced catalytic activities [29]. In this paper, we report the preparation of effectively immobilized Pd nanoparticles on a newly developed core–shell Fe3O4@amine functionalized graphene (Fe3O4@GON) composite as a support. The core–shell Fe3O4@GON composite was prepared by amination of GO. The oxygen functional groups of GO can be easily exchanged with amine groups, and show good cohesion with Pd. The Pd nanoparticles were immobilized by sonochemical reduction, generating monodisperse Pd nanoparticles on Fe3O4@GON. The prepared Pd/Fe3O4@GON composite was used as the catalyst for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between aryl iodides and terminal acetylenes. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized using a solvothermal method [30]. 7.7mmol of FeCl3·6H2O (2.08g) and 56mmol of sodium acetate (NaOAc, 4.60g) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (50mL) with magnetic stirring. The obtained solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave; the autoclave was sealed and heated at 200°C. After 8h, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The resultant mixture was centrifuged; the solid was washed several times with ethanol and vacuum dried at room temperature. 2.2 Preparation of Fe3O4 wrapped by GO (Fe3O4@GO) Prior to Fe3O4@GO preparation, 3-aminopropyltimethoxysilane (APTMS)-treated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized as follows. Fe3O4 nanoparticles (0.2g) were dispersed in ethanol (100mL) and the mixture was sonicated for 30min. APTMS was added and the mixture was refluxed for 4h. The resultant particles were washed several times with ethanol and dried under vacuum. Fe3O4@GO was prepared by electrostatic interaction between positively charged APTMS-treated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and negatively charged GO. GO was synthesized using a modified Hummers method [31]. The APTMS-treated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were added to water of pH6 and the mixture was sonicated for 30min. The amount of GO was adjusted to 2wt.% with respect to Fe3O4. The solution was vigorously stirred for 30min at room temperature. The resultant mixture was centrifuged; the solid was washed several times with water and vacuum dried at 70°C. 2.3 Preparation of Fe3O4@GON The amination of GO was performed using a previously reported method [32]. Fe3O4@GO (0.1g) was dispersed in dried dimethylformamide (DMF, 30mL) by sonication for 30min. After sonication, the Fe3O4@GO solution was cooled to 0°C, and then ethylene dicarbonate (0.153g) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHC, 0.092g) were added. The mixture was stirred for 2h at 0°C. Diethylenetriamine (0.173mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16h. The mixture was separated by centrifugation; the solid was washed several times with acetone and water, and vacuum dried at 70°C. 2.4 Preparation of Pd/Fe3O4@GON Pd was immobilized on Fe3O4@GON, as follows. Fe3O4@GON (0.02g) was dispersed in deionized water (18mL) by sonication for 30min. An aqueous solution of K2PdCl4 (18mM, 2mL) was rapidly added to the container in an ice bath. The mixture was ultrasonicated (Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator 500, 400W, 20min pulse time, and 20% amplitude). The final mixture was centrifuged; the solid was washed with water and vacuum dried at 70°C. 2.5 General procedure for Sonogashira coupling reaction Iodobenzene (0.50mmol), phenylacetylene (0.55mmol), NaOAc (1mmol), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 8mL) were mixed. Well-dispersed Pd/Fe3O4@GO (0.4mol%) in DMSO (2mL) was added to the mixture with vigorous stirring. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the solution by centrifugation. The product was extracted three times with dichloromethane (20mL) and dried using MgSO4. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Pd/Fe3O4@GON Scheme 1 shows the procedure for the preparation of Pd/Fe3O4@GON. Fe3O4@GO was successfully prepared by electrostatic interaction between positively charged APTMS-treated Fe3O4 and negatively charged GO (Fig. 1a, c). The average Fe3O4 core size was approximately 200nm and the GO shell thickness was about 1.5nm. The GO shell was aminated by a condensation reaction between GO and a polyamine. Fig. 1d shows that the amine-treated graphene shell on the Fe3O4 core was well retained after amination. The immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on Fe3O4@GON was performed by sonochemically. Sonochemical syntheses of noble metal nanoparticles have been developed by several groups, because of their numerous advantages such as reduction of metal ions without the use of extra reducing agents, rapid reaction rates and production of uniformly small nanoparticles [33–34]. Pd ions easily bind to the amine groups of Fe3O4@GON and grow into nanoparticles. The role of sonochemical reduction of Pd ions can be summarized as follows: (1) H2O→·OH+·H (water pyrolysis) (2) ·OH (·H)+RH→·R (reducing radicals)+H2O (3) RH→·R+·H (4) Pd(II)+·H, ·R→Pd(0)+R·CHO+H+ (ion reduction) (5) nPd(0)→Pdn (particleformation). Ultrasonic irradiation of an aqueous solution produces free radicals such as ·OH and ·H. The OH radicals generated by water pyrolysis react with C–NH2 and C–OH species on the amine-functionalized graphene, forming ·R, which act as reducing radicals. Pd nanoparticles can be therefore formed by reducing radicals without extra reducing agents. Fig. 2a and b shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the corresponding elemental mappings of Pd/Fe3O4@GON. Pd nanoparticles with average size of 4.75nm were immobilized around Fe3O4@GON. The corresponding elemental mapping images indicate that the Pd elements were immobilized uniformly (Fig. 2c). Fe and O elements were detected in the core material, suggesting the presence of Fe3O4. The high concentration of N elements shows that the oxygen groups on GO were largely replaced with amine groups. We prepared Pd/Fe3O4@GO by immobilizing Pd nanoparticles on Fe3O4@GO, without GO amination, and compared the amounts of Pd nanoparticles immobilized on Fe3O4@GON and on Fe3O4@GO. The TEM images of Pd/Fe3O4@GO show that none-uniform Pd nanoparticles with average size of 28.5nm were immobilized on Fe3O4@GO, and the amount of immobilized Pd nanoparticles was less than that on Fe3O4@GON (Fig. S3). The amount of Pd inPd/Fe3O4@GON and Pd/Fe3O4@GO was estimated about 8.58 and 3.3% respectively, by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry). These results indicate that the Pd nanoparticles interact with amine groups better than oxygen groups, as expect. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Pd/Fe3O4@GON composite. There are peaks located at 30.1°, 35.4°, 43.1°, 53.4°, 56.9°, and 62.5° which are indexed to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440), lattice planes, respectively, and correspond to the spinel structure of Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 19-0629). However, no peaks from Pd nanoparticles were detected in the XRD pattern; this indicates that the diffraction peaks of Pd were invisible because of the excellent dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles [35]. Fig. 4 shows the Fe 2p, C 1s, N 1s and Pd 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Pd/Fe3O4@GON. In the Fe 2p high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4a), the peaks with binding energies of 710.5 and 724.1eV are related to Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2, indicating the formation of mixed oxides of Fe(II) and Fe(III). In the C 1s high-resolution XPS, three peaks at 284.5 (C–C), 285.9 (C–N) and 288.3 (O=C–N) eV were detected, but no additional peaks related to C–O and O–C=O were detected (Fig. 4b). In addition, a N 1s peak at 399.4eV (N–C) appeared (Fig. 4c), this indicates that the oxygen functional groups on GO were successfully exchanged with amine groups. The splitting pattern of the Pd 3d high-resolution XPS contained two doublet peaks (Fig. 4d). The doublet peaks at 337.1 and 342.8eV are assigned to metallic Pd, and the other doublet peaks at 337.8 and 343.3eV, are related to the +2 oxidation state of Pd. The presence of Pd ions in the catalyst may arise from incomplete reduction of Pd ions during the sonochemical reaction and the formation of PdO by oxidation of naked metal Pd atoms under ambient conditions. The magnetic properties of Pd/Fe3O4@GON were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) with an applied field from −7500 to 7500Oe (Fig. S5). The saturated magnetization (Ms) and coercivity (Hc) were 53.8emu/g and 62.5Oe, respectively. The results show that the Pd/Fe3O4@GON catalyst is superparamagnetic, which indicates that no magnetization remained when the applied magnetic field was removed. 3.2 Catalytic reactions The catalytic activity of the Pd/Fe3O4@GON composite was tested in the heterogeneous Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between iodobenzene and phenylacetylene. The optimum reaction conditions were identified based on a series of reactions using different bases (Table 1 , entry 1–5), solvents (Table 1, entries 6–9), reaction temperatures (Table 1, entries 10 and 11), and amounts of catalyst (Table 1, entry 12). The most suitable condition was determined in the presence of 0.5mol% Pd/Fe3O4@GON and NaOAc in DMSO at 120°C (Table 1, entry 11). Next, the catalytic activity of Pd/Fe3O4@GON was compared with those of Pd/Fe3O4@GO, Fe3O4 and commercially available activated carbon supported Pd (Pd/C) under the optimized conditions (Table 1, entries 13–15). The conversions obtained with these four catalysts clearly showed that the catalytic activity of Pd/Fe3O4@GON was higher than those of the other catalysts. Particularly, compared to Pd/Fe3O4@GO (TOF=53.1h−1), the catalytic activity of Pd/Fe3O4@GON (TOF=62.5h−1) was higher, which might be ascribed to smaller size and high dispersity of the Pd nanoparticles on Fe3O4@GON. No coupling reaction occurred with Fe3O4, which proved that the Pd nanoparticles catalyzed the Sonogashira coupling reaction. Table 2 shows the results of further investigations of the catalytic activity of Pd/Fe3O4@GON in Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between various aryl iodides and terminal acetylenes. Under the optimized conditions using 0.5mol% Pd/Fe3O4@GON in DMSO at 120°C, various aryl iodides bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups coupled with phenyl acetylene with conversions of more than 92%. In addition, moderate catalytic activities were observed in the coupling reactions between iodobenzene and various terminal acetylenes. The stability of nanoparticles on a support is an important issue for sustainable use in catalysis. The stability of the Pd/Fe3O4@GON catalyst was examined by performing recycling tests under the optimized conditions. The superparamagnetism of Pd/Fe3O4@GON facilitated separation from the reaction mixture. The separated catalyst was washed several times with ethanol and recycled for the next reaction under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 , the Pd/Fe3O4@GON catalyst was reused six times, with only a slight decrease in the catalytic activity, for the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between iodobenzene and phenylacetylene. The catalytic activity remained constant at 87% until the fourth cycle, and then decreased to 77% after the fifth cycle. Fig. S6 shows the reused catalyst after six consecutive cycles. Although part of the GON shell was detached from Fe3O4, Pd nanoparticles were still immobilized on the GON because of the strong interactions between Pd and GON. The amount of palladium leaching (after six recycles) from Pd/Fe3O4@GON with the aid of ICP-OES was found to be 3.74wt.%. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we developed a method for stable and effective Pd nanoparticle immobilization on Fe3O4@amine-functionalized graphene core–shell nanocomposites. The immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on the amine-functionalized support material was better than that before the amine treatment. In this process, the Pd nanoparticles were easily synthesized using the sonochemical method, without additional reducing agents. The prepared Pd/Fe3O4@GON catalyst gave good conversions and high regioselectiviteis in Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between aryl iodides and terminal acetylenes. Furthermore, the catalyst retained its catalytic activity for several cycles.
