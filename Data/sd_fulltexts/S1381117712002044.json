Graphical abstract Highlights ► Electrospun silica fibers were coated with an alkyl-silicate layer containing lipase. ► The lipase-immobilizing fibrous catalyst successfully worked in an organic solvent. ► The catalytic activity was 1.8 times greater than that of physically adsorbed lipase. ► The catalyst worked for 15 days with a 10% reduction in catalytic performance. Electrospun ultrafine silica fibers were coated with alkyl-silica encapsulating Burkholderia cepacia lipase to fabricate fibrous catalysts for reactions in organic solvents. The optimal catalytic performance of the immobilized lipase, determined from the initial transesterification rate of triglyceride in rapeseed oil with n-butanol, was 15- and 1.8-times faster than that of reagent lipase powder and lipase physically adsorbed onto silica fibers, respectively. Furthermore, the equilibrium conversion yield of the new catalyst was almost 100%, whereas that of the physically adsorbed lipase was only about 70%. Catalytic activity was maintained for 15 days in a flow-through continuous reaction system, with a 10% reduction in conversion yield at the outlet of the reactor compared with the value detected at day 1. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the fibrous silica catalyst containing immobilized lipase for reactions in organic solvents. Keywords Lipase Electrospinning Flow-through reactor Sol–gel Silica 1 Introduction Industrial applications of enzymes are often limited by a lack of long-term stability and the difficulty of enzyme recovery for re-use. Enzyme immobilization is widely recognized as an effective way to solve these problems [1]. From an operational performance viewpoint, the use of suitable immobilization methods on/into carriers, e.g., adsorption, covalent binding, and entrapment, and choice of carriers are known to be important issues for industrial processes. In recent decades, nanostructured carriers and mesoporous carriers have attracted significant attention because of their special properties, such as very high surface area-to-volume ratios, which enables a high enzyme content for a given reactor volume [2–4]. Silica has often been investigated as a material for nanostructured carriers because of its high tolerance to organic solvents, high thermal stability, and the ease with which nanostructured and mesoporous constructs can be fabricated [3,4]. Electrospinning is a simple and versatile method for producing ultrafine fibers with diameters ranging from several microns to 100nm or less. Electrospun fibers are exceptionally long, uniform in diameter and have diverse compositions [2]. Attractive features of electrospun fibers, compared with other nanostructured carriers, are their high porosity and interconnectivity, which are useful for the diffusion of substrate towards or product away from the loaded enzyme. Furthermore, a fibrous membrane-like structure is effective for easy recovery of immobilized enzymes from reaction media and continuous operation in a bioreactor. The recovery of nanoparticles from dispersed reaction media for reuse is often difficult [5]. Therefore, various enzymes have been immobilized on a variety of electrospun fibers [2,6–8]. The aim of this study was to fabricate lipase-immobilizing, ultrafine, fibrous silica catalysts for reactions in organic solvents. Lipases are versatile enzymes used in a variety of applications from industrial to pharmaceutical fields. The enzyme catalyzes several reactions in organic media, including transesterification, esterification, and thiotransesterification, as well as the hydrolysis of triglycerides in aqueous media [9]. A unique feature of lipases as catalysts in organic media is that they can be highly activated and stabilized by tuning the hydrophobicity of the surrounding environment [10]. For example, encapsulation of lipase in alkyl-substituted silica (alkyl-silica) by the sol–gel method has been reported to be effective in enhancing catalytic activity [11–15]. The porous structure allows substrates and products to diffuse in and out of the sol–gel derived silica matrices [16]. We also previously reported that lipase immobilized in electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers after encapsulation in alkyl-silica nanoparticles showed a higher catalytic activity in organic solvents than that immobilized directly in PVA fibers [17]. One drawback of the PVA fibrous catalyst, which resulted in hindrance of the catalytic activity of the enclosed lipase, was the swelling of individual fibers by adsorption of water in the organic solvent [18]. Considering the potential problems that may arise with the use of organic polymers through interactions with substrates, products, and solvents, we propose that electrospun ultrafine silica fibers may comprise a versatile carrier for lipases, enabling a variety of reactions to be carried out in organic solvents. In the present study, we developed a lipase-immobilizing, ultrafine, fibrous silica catalyst. This catalyst was prepared by coating electrospun silica fibers with an alkyl-silica layer encapsulating lipase (Fig. 1 ). The alkyl-silica was obtained through the sol–gel process, involving the hydrolysis and polymerization of two silicon alkoxide precursors, tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and n-butyltrimethoxysilane (BTMOS). Hydrolysis of the precursors results in the formation of SiOH bonds. The bonds polymerize into SiOSi bonds, and a three-dimensional network entrapping lipase is developed [19]. The effectiveness of the fibrous catalyst was evaluated by determining the catalytic activity and stability for a reaction producing fatty acid butyl-esters from n-butanol and rapeseed oil. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Electrospun silica fibrous mats were kindly donated by Japan Vilene Company, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The average diameter of the fibers was about 700nm. Burkholderia cepacia lipase (Lipase PS-SD) was obtained from Amano Enzyme Inc. (Aichi, Japan). Rapeseed oil and TMOS were purchased from Riken (Saga, Japan) and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The composition of fatty acids in the oil was reported by the manufacturer to be 61.6% oleic acid, 19.6% linoleic acid, 10.1% linolenic acid, 4.2% palmitic acid, and 1.9% stearic acid. n-Butanol was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). BTMOS was kindly supplied by Dow Corning Toray Co. (Ichihara, Japan). 2.2 Immobilization of lipase encapsulated in an alkyl-silica coating on silica fibers A brief scheme for the production of lipase-immobilizing fibrous silica catalyst is shown in Fig. 1. BTMOS and TMOS were mixed at a 4:1 molar ratio in a glass tube and distilled water was added. A 1/40 (v/v) ratio of 40mM HCl was added to make a total volume of 200μL and mixed in an ice bath. The resultant mixture was placed into a hot water bath at 90°C for several minutes to allow the hydrolysis reaction of TMOS and BTMOS to proceed until the mixture became a homogeneous sol. Subsequently, the resultant sol was cooled in an ice bath for 5min and 1.8mL of sodium phosphate buffer (PB, 100mM, pH 7.5) was added to the cooled sol. 1.0mL of PB (100mM, pH 7.5) containing 300mg reagent lipase powder was then poured slowly into the sol solution and mixed using a magnetic stirrer for 20s. The molar ratio of total silanes to 100mol water in the sol was varied from 0.4 to 2.4 to evaluate its effect. Silica fibrous mats cut into small squares, 3mm×3mm (300mg), were added into the sol containing the lipase. After 1min of mixing, the resultant fibrous mats, incorporating the lipase-containing alkyl-silica sol between individual fibers, were lyophilized for 1 day. After lyophilization, the increase in mass of the vessel containing the fibrous specimen with deposited alkyl-silica gel was measured to calculate the content of lipase per unit mass of the alkyl-silica gel. The mass of the resultant fibrous specimen was then measured to calculate the lipase content per unit mass of the resultant fibrous specimens. The specimens were used for subsequent studies without rinsing. Electrospun silica fibers containing physically adsorbed lipase were used as controls. Specimens were prepared by mixing silica fiber mats (300mg) with 30mL PB (pH 7.5) containing 300mg of lipase powder and stirring on an orbital shaker at 255rpm for 12h at 25°C, followed by drying. The amount of lipase immobilized was determined by measuring the lipase content in the remaining solution by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of physically adsorbed lipase on the silica fibers was 5.6mg-protein/g-catalyst (catalyst: protein+silica). 2.3 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic activity of the immobilized lipase was determined from the initial transesterification rate of rapeseed oil and n-butanol to produce fatty acid butyl-esters as follows: fabric samples immobilizing 110μg lipase-protein (BSA standard) or reagent lipase powder containing 110μg lipase-protein were placed in a 20mL screw-capped glass vial containing 4.2mL of reaction medium. The reaction medium was a mixture of rapeseed oil and n-butanol containing water at 8000ppm. This water content was less than that required to cause phase-separation, resulting in a water-in-oil emulsion system. The molar ratio of triglyceride in rapeseed oil and alcohol was 1:3. The vessel was mixed at 1300rpm at 40°C using a temperature controlled shaker. Initial transesterification rates were determined from the increase in concentration of C18 fatty acid butyl-esters during the first 2h of reaction in the range of less than 30% conversion, with measurements taken every half hour. The concentration of C18 fatty acid butyl-esters was determined using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010, Kyoto, Japan) using methyl laurate as an internal standard, based on a calibration curve for n-butyl ester obtained from butyl-oleate. The C18 fatty acids content in the rapeseed oil used in this study was 93.2% (supplier's data). Conversion was calculated from following equation: Conversion (%)=[C18 butyl-esters concentration (mM)]/[total fatty acids concentration in fresh reaction medium×0.932]×100. 2.4 Stability measurement A fabric sample immobilizing 1mg lipase protein was placed into a glass tube of 1cm inner diameter and 10cm length. Both ends of the glass tube were sealed with caps equipped with plastic tubing connected to a pump. The glass tube was horizontally placed and the reaction medium at 40°C was flowed at 0.25cm/min throughout 15 days of operation without changing the flow direction. The medium exiting the outlet of the glass tube was collected to determine the degree of conversion. The reason for adopting this flow rate was that it resulted in about 30% conversion. Below 30% conversion, the conversion increased linearly with reaction time in batch experiments (Section 2.3), i.e., the reaction cycle of the enzymes proceeds faster under this condition. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Alkyl-silica depositions The electrospun silica fibers used in this study were produced from a viscous sol obtained through the sol–gel process involving hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane, based on a previously reported method, without addition of organic polymers, which must be removed by subsequent calcination [20]. Thus, the surface of the fibers was abundant in silanol groups, which can subsequently condense with one another. We attempted to precipitate alkyl-silica containing lipase onto the fibers by condensing the silanol groups on the fibers with those in hydrolyzed alkyl-silica precursors. As shown in Fig. 2 , the smooth surface observed on electrospun silica fibers before alkyl-silica deposition (a) changed to a rough surface when alkyl-silica was deposited at a molar ratio of silanes (TMOS+BTMOS) to water of 0.8:100 (b). Under this condition, the interconnected void space between individual fibers was well preserved, in a similar way to the fibers before treatment (Fig. 2a). The weight of the resultant fibrous matrices containing alkyl-silica and lipase increased with the molar ratio of silanes to water (Fig. 3 ). At a molar ratio of 2.4:100, the majority of the initial void spaces between the individual fibers were occupied by silica precipitates (Fig. 2c). The high porosity and interconnectivity of the electrospun fibers make them attractive as enzyme carriers. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that we can precipitate alkyl-silica on electrospun fibers, while preserving their interconnectivity by controlling the amount of alkyl-silica precursors. 3.2 Catalytic performance It has been reported that the encapsulation of lipase in alkyl-silica is an effective way to enhance catalytic activity in organic media [11–13]. In this study, we obtained alkyl-silica from a mixture of BTMOS and TMOS at a molar ratio of 4:1. This condition was chosen based on a previous report describing an eight-fold increase in the initial reaction rate for methanolysis of rapeseed oil compared with that of reagent powder lipase [13]. In that report, a non-fibrous matrix with a monolithic structure was coated with alkyl-silica containing lipase. Fig. 4 shows initial reaction rates calculated from the data for conversions of triglyceride and n-butanol to butyl-esters below 30%, using the same lipase content for each reaction condition. The lipase immobilized on the silica fibers via physical adsorption showed an 8.5-times greater initial reaction rate than that of reagent lipase powder. The same tendency has also been reported for non-fibrous matrices such as mesoporous [21] and nanoparticle silicates [22]. The greater catalytic performance of the physically adsorbed lipase on the matrices was explained by the high dispersity of lipase [22]. Reagent lipase is a crude purification product containing a lipase-stabilizing agent that is insoluble in organic solvent, resulting in low dispersity of the lipase molecules in the solvent [23]. A noteworthy result of this study was that the initial reaction rate increased with an increasing molar ratio of silanes to water from 0.4:100 to 0.8:100 (Fig. 4). The maximum initial reaction rate at a molar ratio of 0.8:100 was 15- and 1.8-times faster than those of reagent lipase powder and physically adsorbed lipase on the silica fibers, respectively. However, further increases in the molar ratio resulted in a decrease in the initial reaction rate. Considering the fixed molar ratio of BTMOS and TMOS (4:1), resulting in alkyl-silicas having the same degree of hydrophilicity for each condition, the hyperactivation can be explained by the enhancement of hydrophobicity around the lipase by the increasing amount of alkyl-silica deposition, as shown in Fig. 3. The enhancement of catalytic activity of lipase on/in hydrophobic carriers in organic media has been explained by interaction between the lipophilic domains of the lipases and the hydrophobic materials, resulting in a more active conformation of the enzyme in organic media [11–13,24]. The decrease in the initial reaction rate with increasing molar ratios of silanes to water from 0.8:100 to 2.4:100 was interpreted as a consequence of the hindrance of substrate supply to lipase by the excess amount of alkyl-silica deposited around the lipase molecules, as indicated by the increase in weight of alkyl-silica. The amount of alkyl-silica at a molar ratio of silanes to water of 2.4:100 was 2.4-times greater than that at 0.8:100 (Fig. 3). The excess alkyl-silica filled the void space between individual fibers required for the flow of medium containing substrate (Fig. 2c). Fig. 5 shows the transition in the degree of conversion of rapeseed oil to butyl-esters by the silica fibrous catalysts containing physically adsorbed lipase and the lipase encapsulated in alkyl-silica prepared at a molar ratio of silanes to water of 0.8:100. An interesting finding was the difference in equilibrium conversions between the two systems, despite the use of the same amount of lipase (110μg-protein/4.2mL reaction medium). Equilibrium conversion was around 70% for the catalyst with physically adsorbed lipase but was almost 100% with lipase encapsulated in alkyl-silica. We believe that the lower equilibrium conversion with physically adsorbed lipase can be attributed to the lower hydrophobicity of the naked silica fibers, resulting in attachment of glycerin, the main by-product of transesterification of triglyceride with alcohol, onto the surface of the individual fibers. In fact, we observed the formation of glycerin droplets on the bottom of glass vessels after completion of the reaction by the catalyst with alkyl-silica but these were not observed when using the catalyst with physically adsorbed lipase. The attached glycerin would hinder diffusion of substrate towards or product away from the loaded lipase and result in an equilibrium conversion around 70%. An external mass transfer limitation due to the formation of an external film layer on lipase-immobilizing carriers has been reported as the cause of decreased enzyme efficiency [25]. For biodiesel production systems using immobilized lipase, glycerin has been reported to decrease enzyme activity through mass transfer limitations [26,27]. Therefore, it has been suggested that formation of an external glycerin film layer on carriers should be avoided [25]. In light of these observations, the deposition of hydrophobic alkyl-silica on electrospun ultrafine silica fibers would be effective not only through hyperactivation of the immobilized lipase but also through inhibition of the film layer formation that would decrease the enzyme efficiency for reactions in organic solutions producing hydrophilic by-products. Finally, we studied the stability of the new catalyst using a flow-through reactor. As shown in Fig. 6 , the decrease in conversion after 2 weeks continuous operation was about 10% compared with that after 1 day of operation. In this experiment, we set the flow rate of the reaction medium at 0.25cm/min to give about 30% conversion at the outlet of the reactor. As shown in Fig. 5, conversion increased linearly with reaction time during batch experiments so the reaction cycle of the enzymes proceeds faster under conditions that give about 30% conversion. This result indicates the catalyst was stable for 2 weeks of operation under continuous, heavy working conditions. 4 Conclusion The aim of the present study was to develop a catalyst immobilizing lipase on electrospun ultrafine silica fibers for reactions in organic solvents. The lipase was encapsulated in alkyl-silica to enhance the catalytic efficiency. The fibrous catalyst was developed by soaking electrospun silica fibrous mats in an alkyl-silica precursor sol containing lipase, followed by subsequent gelation and drying. The alkyl-silica was obtained from a mixture of BTMOS and TMOS at a molar ratio of 4:1. The greatest initial reaction rate of transesterification of triglyceride in rapeseed oil and n-butanol was obtained at a molar ratio of silanes to water of 0.8:100. Under these conditions, the initial reaction rate was 15- and 1.8-times faster than those of reagent lipase powder and lipase physically adsorbed onto the silica fibers, respectively. In addition, after 15 days of continuous operation in a flow-through reactor, the fibrous catalyst with the lipase-encapsulating alkyl-silica layer maintained 90% of the conversion measured at day 1. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the lipase-immobilizing fibrous silica catalyst for reactions in organic solvents. References [1] R.A. Sheldon Adv. Synth.
