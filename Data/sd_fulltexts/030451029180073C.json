Szymanska-Buzar Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw, 50-383 Wroclaw (Poland) (Received November 26, 1990; accepted March 6, 1991) Abstract Different tungsten carbonyl complexes: [W(CO),Lz], [NEt4][W(CO),LX] and [WXZ(CO)3Lz], where L=CH3CN, pip, PPh2H, PPh3, bipy, dppe, Zr(PPhz)2cP2, Zr(PPh2C~H,)ZC12, X=Cl-, Br-, can be transformed into catalysts for olefin metathesis in the presence of certain Group 4, 13 or 14 element halides (AX.). The process of transformation of these systems into catalytically active complexes is a multistage one. The first stage is based upon the interaction of the tungsten complex with AX as Lewis acid, which abstracts one ligand from the coordination sphere of tungsten, thus freeing a coordination site for the attachment of an olefin ligand. Catalytic activity of the system depends upon ligand L and X in the tungsten complex and element A in AX . In the series of halides studied, the most active proved to be ZrCl4, whose activity could be explained by its high Lewis acidity at the most stable metal halide bond. Introduction The known catalytic systems for olefin metathesis reactions are mostly multicomponent, based on transition metals W, Mo and Re and organometallics [ 1 ]. The interaction between them leads to the formation of true catalyst for the olefin metathesis, which is a metal-carbene species [ 2 ] . The contribution of the metal carbene compounds formed in separate reactions in the multiple catalytic cycles still requires the presence of a suitable Lewis acid [3-5]. The role of the Lewis acids in these systems is based upon the labilization of the coordination sphere of the transition metal. In studies of the metathesis reaction mechanism, the most difficult problem is to explain how the metal-carbene would be formed in catalyst systems that do not contain an organometallic component and the initially formed carbene must come from the olefin. Such a situation exists in the classical heterogeneous catalysts such as Mo03, Re207.and W(CO)6 supported on alumina [6], combinations such as WC167-AIC13 [7] or the photochemically induced W(CO)6 organic or inorganic halides catalytic system investigated by us previously [8, 9]. The structure of the true catalytic species formed by the tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes is still unknown. Synthesis and structural investigations of [(carbene)(7r-olefin)W(CO)4] complexes have revealed the trans position 0304-5l02O1/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 178 of the carbene and olefin ligands [ 10 ]. It therefore appears questionable whether metal(0) carbonyl complexes are realistic models for olefin metathesis [ 10]. We have scrutinized the catalytic systems based upon the different tungsten carbonyl complexes activated by metal and non-metal halides. Our goal was not only to determine the catalytic activity of these new systems, but also to clarify the role of both components of the system in formation of the true catalytic species. Experimental Reagents The following compounds were prepared by literature procedures: [NEt4j[W(CO)5C1] [11], [NEt4][W(CO)4(PPh3)Cl] [12], [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] [13], [W(CO)4(pip)2] (pip=NHC5H,o) [14], [W(CO)4(NBND)] (NBND=norbornadiene) [15], [W(CO)4(PPh2H)2] [16], [W(CO)4(dppe)] (dppe=bis(diphenylphosphino) ethylene) [17], [W(CO)4(bipy)] (bipy=2,2'-bipyridine) [181, [W(CO)q(A-PPh2)2ZrCp2l [191, [WC12(CO)3(PPh3)21 [201, [WC12(CO)3(bipy)] [21], [WC12(CO)2'(dppe)] [20], [NMe4][ZrClb] [22], [NMe4]2[ZrCIg] [22], Cp2ZrC12 (Cp=C5H5) [23], ZrC14(THFD2 [24], Zr(PPh2C5H4)2*C12 [25]. [W(CO)4(PPh2C5H4)2ZrC12] was prepared by modifying Tikkanen's preparation of molybdenum compound [25]. [V,/Br2(CO)3(PPh3)21 was prepared in similar way as [WC12(CO)3 - (PPh3)21 [20]. [WCl(CO)3(PPh3)2SnC13 was obtained by photochemical reaction of W(CO)s with PPh3 and SnC14 [26]. ZrCl4 and AIC13 were used after sublimation. All solvents and liquid reagents were dried, distilled and deoxygenated by a minimum of three freeze-thaw cycles and stored under argon. Heptane was distilled from sodium-potassium amalgam, chlorobenzene from P205 and olefins from CaH2. All manipulations were performed under argon using a vacuum line and standard Schlenk techniques. Metathesis reaction procedure Reaction mixture contained 3 X 10-3 mol 1-1 tungsten carbonyl compound, 0.3 mol 1-1 pent-2-ene and 3 X 10-2 mol 1-' of metal or nonmetal halide in 20 cm3 chlorobenzene, benzene or heptane. After the required amount of solid compounds were introduced, the reactor was evacuated and then filled with argon. Liquid reagents were added via syringe while the system was still under nitrogen flow. The course of the reaction was followed by observing the changes in IR spectra of the reaction mixture and by GLC analysis of the reaction products. Infrared spectra were obtained with Specord 75 and 80 IR instruments. IH NMR spectra were recorded on a Tesla 100 spectrometer. 179 Results and discussion In many reports about the photocatalytic reactions of the transition metal carbonyls, the olefin-carbonyl complexes formed by CO photosubstitution by olefinic ligand are regarded as catalytically active [27-30]. On investigations of the catalytic activity of W(CO)s, it was found that photochemical substitution of CO by alkene was not enough to initiate the metathesis reaction [8, 9]. The formation of the catalytically active transition compound requires the presence of a compound with electron-acceptor properties; it could be a metal or non-metal halide. The donor-acceptor interactions between the tungsten complex and electron-acceptor reduce the electron density at tungsten and make the metal center more reactive. In the W(CO)6-olefin photochemical system, the cis-W(CO)2L2 type complexes, stable in the reaction conditions, were observed by IR only in the presence of electron acceptors [9]. It seemed interesting to examine the catalytic activity of cis-W(CO)4L2 type tungsten compounds (L = nitrogen or phosphorus ligands of different donor-acceptor properties). Especially attractive is the [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] complex, in which the poor ir-acceptor ligand acetonitrile can be very easily exchange by a stronger 7r-acceptor ligand alkene [15]. The olefin complexes formed do not initiate olefin metathesis, but they can be activated in the presence of halides AX, [9]. No less interesting is the comparison of the catalytic activity of substituted tungsten(0) carbonyl and tungsten(II) carbonyl compounds. (W(CO)4 (CH3 CN)2), AX, In the system [W(CO)4(CHaCN)2], AX,(ZrC14) and pent-2-ene in nonpolar solvents at room temperature, the equilibrium mixture of olefins containing 5096 pent-2-ene and 25ss'o each hex-3-ene and but-2-ene was formed in 15 min (Table 1). AIC13 is almost as effective as ZrC14 as activator, and TiC14 TABLE 1 Effect of halide (AX ) on pent-2-ene metathesis in the presence of [W(CO)4(CH3CN)Zl AX Conversion of pent-2-ene' A-X bond energy [381 (9 b) (kcal mol-') ZrC14 50 112 A1C13 40 99 TiC19 24 82 CC14 < 1 78 CBr4 < 1 49 SiC14 - 91 SnC14 - 76 Reaction mixture contained 3 X 10-3 mol 1-' [W(COVCH3CN)21, 1-3 X 10-2 mol 1-' AX and 0.3 mol 1-' pent-2-ene in 20 cm3 chlorobenzene. '% Hex-3-ene X 2 after 15 min at room temperature. 180 a bit worse (Table 1). The very low activity of the system with CC14 and CBr4 could be explained by the simultaneous halogenation of tungsten(0) complexes by CC14 and CBr4, producing tungsten(II) halocarbonyl compounds, inactive in this system. The reaction between [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] and CBr, in CrH5C1 solution at room temperature is accompanied by the appearance of new v(CO) bands at frequencies higher than those of [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] (Fig. lb). The band at 2035 cm-' can be attributed to [W(Br2(CO)3(CH3CN)2], Synthesized by Baker et al. [311, which has v(CO) absorptions at 2033s, 1982m and 1940s cm-'. The v(CO) absorption band at 2095 cm-' is characteristic for the carbonyl halides of tungsten(II) [32]. The same reaction, carried out in CHZCl2 solution, produced [WZBr4(CO)$ ] quantitatively, with v(CO) absorption bands at 2095m, 2018s and 1930vs cm-' (Fig. lc), without the formation of the catalytically active complex. The reaction of [W(CO)4(CH3CN)21 with CC14 proceeds in a similar way, as indicated by the changes in the IR spectra (Fig. la). The unstable [WCIZ(CO)3(CH3CN)2] exhibited v(CN) absorption bands at 2330 and 2300 cm-' (from coordinated CH3CN) and v(CO) bands at 2030, 1985 and 1945 cm-' (Fig. la). The tin and silicon tetrachlorides reacted with [W(CO)4(CH3CN)Z] in C6H5C1 solution without formation of the catalytically active compound.

The latter exhibits v(CO) absorption bands at 2033s, 2018shm, 1962m and 1928vs cm-' in CHZCIZ solution (Fig. Id) and v(CO) at 2033s, 1982m, 1940m, 1905vs, v(SnCI) at 342m, 323m and v(CN) at 2335 and 2305 cm-' in Nujol. The similar compound [MOCl(CO)3(CH3CN)ZSnCl3] described by Baker and Bury [331 shows v(CO) absorption bands at 2017, 1978 and 1934 cm-'. The small differences in IR spectra of both compounds are probably due to the presence of [WC12(CO)3(CH3CN)21, a decomposition product of [WCl(CO)3(CH3CN)ZSnC13]. This is also indicated by the presence of three methyl group protons signals in the 'H NMR spectrum (2.58, 2.48, 2.31 ppm). SiC14 also undergoes oxidative addition to [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2]. The IR spectrum of the reaction mixture in Nyjol exhibits v(CO) bands at 2030, 1985 and 1930 cm-', v(CN) 2320 and 2300 cm-' and v(SiCI) at 372 cm-'. The somewhat lower activity of TiCl4-containing systems, compared with ZrC14, could be due to the elimination of [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2], as the result of oxidation with TiC14. The IR spectrum of the reaction mixture show the v(CO) band at 2115 cm-' (Fig. 2d) characteristic for carbonyl halides of tungsten(II) complexes. The interaction of [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] with ZrC14 and AIC13 in nonpolar solvents (C6Hg or C6H5C1) could be regarded as the donor-acceptor interaction a b c d u 1 21 0 21 20 1f 2f 20 19 11 0 .1000w, Fig. 2.

This interaction lowers the v(CO) absorption band of the initial compound from 2024 cm-' to 2014 and 2000 cm-' (Fig. 2a). The range below 2000 cm- `was impossible to observe because of absorption from the solvent. The removal of solvent from the reaction mixture and dissolution of the remainder in CH2C12 or CHC13 was followed by decomposition of the donor-acceptor complex and formation of halogenation products. The latter were mainly [W2(CO)8CI4] and [W2(CO)7C14] and traces of 1WC12(C0)3(CH3CN)2)h confirmed by 'H NMR. The signal from the CH3CN methyl group protons appeared at 2.49 and 2.30 ppm. It is assumed that the role of an oxidizer is played here by the alkyl halide. The ZrC14 only helps in the formation of coordinatively unsaturated species. [W(CO)4(CH3CN)2] in pure CH2C12 undergoes slow decarbonylation with formation of unidentified compounds, but not lW(CO)4CI2]2* The differences in behaviour between ZrC14 and the other tetrahalides should be discussed considering the Lewis acidity of AX, and stability of the A-X bond. Because the A-X bond is most stable in ZrC14 (Table 1), ZrC14 interacts with the tungsten complex as the Lewis acid, without cleavage of the Zr-Cl bond and without electron transfer from tungsten to zirconium. (WCCO)4L2 J, Z? -C14 The catalytic activities of the [W(CO)4L2]-type compounds, activated by ZrCl4 at room temperature are compared in Table 2. Catalytic activity of the system was found to increase with increasing lability of the ligand L in the tungsten complex.

Reaction mixture was irradiated with mercury lamp HBO 200. 183 ZrC14, a strong Lewis acid, interacts with the [W(CO)4L2 ] tungsten complex through the oxygen of the most basic CO groups in the trans position to ligand L. This labilizes the ligand L, which will then coordinate to the ZrCl4 molecule, giving rise to the formation of ZrC14L2. Increasing the -rr acceptor properties of the ligand L and increasing the stability of the tungsten complex, due to the chelating factor of ligand L, lowered the susceptibility to activation by ZrC14, and in consequence, the catalytic activity of the system (Table 2). The zirconium compounds of lower acidity, i.e. ZrCp2C12, Zr(PPh2C5H4)2C12 and [NMe4]2[ZrCls], do not activate the tungsten complex. However, [NMe4][ZrC15] is capable of such activation. [Zr(PPh2C5H4)2C12] in reaction with [W(CO)4L2] (L=CH3CN, piperidine) may substitute the L in the coordination sphere of tungsten to produce a stable, bimetallic complex inactive in metathesis reaction even in the present of ZrC14. Another bimetallic compound, [W(CO)4(p.-PPh2)2ZrCp2 ], is activated by ZrC14. Its catalytic activity is comparable to that displayed by the other [W(CO)4L2] tungsten complex, where L = bidentate ligands, (Table 2). lWXz (C0)3La]y Z? _Cla The halocarbonyls of W(II), which are formed as the halogenation products of tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes in the earlier discussed reactions, were the deactivation products of W(0) complexes. Tungsten(II) complexes synthesized separately and then applied together with ZrC14 exhibit high catalytic activity (Table 3). The catalytic properties of such compounds were reported by Bencze and coworkers [34-36] who applied [MX2(CO)3L2] (M=Mo, W; X=Cl-, Br-; L=PPh3, AsPh3) as catalysts for the metathesis of terminal olefins and for the ring-opening polymerization of cycloalkenes. Activation of these compounds requires high temperature. In our studies, ZrC14 activated them in chlorobenzene solution at room temperature. Zirconium tetrachloride interacts with tungsten complexes as the Lewis acid. Because of its high affinity for TABLE 3 Comparison of the catalytic activity of tungsten(II) complexes in pent-2-ene metathesis in the presence of ZrCl4 Tungsten compounds Conversion of pent-2-ene' M [WCIZ(CO)3(PPh3)21 50 [WBrz(CO)3(PPh3)21 20 [WCIZ(CO)3(bipY)1 < 1 [WCIZ(CO)2(dppe)] < 1 [WCl(CO)3(PPh3)zSnC13] 1 Reaction mixture contained 3 X 10-3 mol 1-' tungsten compound, 1-3 X 10-Z mol 1-' ZrCl4 and 0.3 mol I-' pent-2-ene in 20 cm3 C6H5Cl. \"46 Hex-3-ene X 2 after 30 min at room temperature. 184 the halide ligand, it could easily be removed from the coordination sphere of tungsten, freeing a coordination site for the attachment of an olefin. The IR spectrum of [WC12(CO)3 - (PPh3)2 ] and ZrCl, in chlorobenzene solution shows the v(CO) band at 2045 cm=', while the highest frequency band for [WCI2(CO)3(PPh3)] is located at 2014 cm-' (Fig. 3c). IR spectra support the fact that ZrC14 is bound to the halide, presumably trues to the CO group, removes electron density from tungsten and weakens the bond between tungsten and the carbonyl group. The following equilibrium could be assumed to exist in solution: WC12(CO)3(PPh3)21 + ZrCl4 [(PPh3)2(CO)3W,C1-ZrCi4 ] ~Cl-~ [(PPh3)2(CO)3W\"L*\"-ZrCls] ;i:---- [(PPh3)a(CO)3WMi]+ L* C1 L* z[ZrClf,]-z (NEt J1W(CO)QLXJ, ZrCI, ZrC14 may activate the W(II) and W(0) halocarbonyl compounds, by interaction as the Lewis acid via the halide ligand.

The [W(CO)4(PPh3)(ethylene)] synthesized by Schenk and Miiller [37] has v(CO) absorptions at 2033, 1949, 1936 and 1908 cm-'. Conclusions The interaction of tungsten carbonyl complexes with halides of elements A drawn from Group 4, 3 or 14, [AXj gives rise to the formation of the true catalysts for olefin metathesis reaction. They are formed by removal of one L or X ligand from the coordination sphere of the tungsten, thus providing a coordination site for the incoming olefinic ligand. The catalytic activity of [W(CO)4L2] complexes depends on the donor-acceptor properties of the ligand L. The highest is for acetonitrile (the poor ir-acceptor) and it declines with increasing 7r-acceptor properties of the ligand L. This is confirmed by substitution of the L, rather than CO, by the olefin. In the case of tungsten complexes containing CO, L and halide X in the coordination sphere, ZrCl4 because of its high affinity to halide, removes halide X from the coordination sphere of the tungsten. This applies to tungsten(0) and (II) complexes. The catalytic activity of the system also depends on the properties of AX. halide, mainly on its Lewis acidity and stability of the A-X bond. For weak A-X bonds, the interaction of the Lewis acid with tungsten(0) could lead to oxidative addition or oxidative halogenation and deactivation of the tungsten complexes. Disregarding the Lewis acidity of SnC14, its interaction with [W(CO)4L2] yields only the product of oxidative addition, [WCl(CO)3LZSnCl3], inactive in the catalytic process. The interaction of tungsten(0) complexes with other halides CC14, CBr4 and TiC14 also partially eliminates the tungsten complex as a result of redox processes, yielding [WXZ(CO)3L2] and/or [W(CO)4X2]. The tungsten(II) complexes formed here could be activated by Lewis acids, which are good halide acceptors. The nonpolar solvents which stabilize the molecular complexes formed between the tungsten compounds and AX4 are favourable for the formation of the catalytically active species. Such solvents, such as THF and CH3CN, interact with ZrC14 as nucleophiles and suppress its Lewis acidity towards the tungsten complex. Dichloromethane deactivates, by oxidation, the coordinatively unsaturated species formed in the interaction between Lewis acids and tungsten complexes. References 1 J. K.

Szymańska-Buzar Institute of Chemistry, University of Wrocław, 50-383 Wrocław Poland Different tungsten carbonyl complexes: [W(CO)4L2], [NEt4[W(CO)4LX] and [WX2(CO)3L2], where L = CH3CN, pip, PPh2H, PPh3, bipy, dppe, Zr(PPh2)2cp2, Zr(PPh2C5H4)2Cl2, X = Cl−, Br−, can be transformed into catalysts for olefin metathesis in the presence of certain Group 4, 13 or 14 element halides (AX n ). The process of transformation of these systems into catalytically active complexes is a multistage one. The first stage is based upon the interaction of the tungsten complex with AX n as Lewis acid, which abstracts one ligand from the coordination sphere of tungsten, thus freeing a coordination site for the attachment of an olefin ligand. Catalytic activity of the system depends upon ligand L and X in the tungsten complex and element A in AX n . In the series of halides studied, the most active proved to be ZrCl4, whose activity could be explained by its high Lewis acidity at the most stable metal halide bond. References 1 J.K.
