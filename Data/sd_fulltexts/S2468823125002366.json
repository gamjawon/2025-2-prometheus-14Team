The challenge is to develop highly active and green organocatalysts in this domain. Herein, the zwitterionic carboxybetaine catalyzed the ROP mechanism of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) cyclic ester and lactide (LA) was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). By comparing the ROP of TMC catalyzed by natural trimethyl glycine (TMG) and unnatural tetramethylammonium acetate (TMAA), we found the proton-accepting ability of the anion part in zwitterionic carboxybetaine is the main influencing factor of polymerization activity. Based on this finding, it is proposed to enhance the proton-accepting ability of the anion part in TMG by extending carbon spacer lengths between CH3COO‒ and N(CH3)4 + of TMG. Among them zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules ((CH3)3N+(CH2)nCOO‒ (n = 1–5)), the (CH3)3N+(CH2)4COO‒ shows the highest catalytic activity in the ROP of TMC. Moreover, the ROP of LA catalyzed by (CH3)3N+(CH2)4COO‒ showed very high catalytic activity compared to the TMG in both theoretical calculation and experiment. This work will inspire the future development of natural organocatalysts with high catalytic performance.

At present, the majority of the polyesters and polycarbonates are obtained via the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters and carbonates, wherein the catalysts play a decisive role in prompting the polymerization process [5,6]. Numerous organometallic catalysts were widely used in the ROP of cyclic esters and carbonates, but potential metal-residues toxicity and the costly removal of metal impurities from synthetic polymer could severely limit polyesters and polycarbonates in the files of biomedical and environmental engineering [7–13]. Therefore, the selection of organocatalysts is pivotal for the synthesizing polymers without metal residues [14–16]. Many organocatalysts have proven effective for ROP of cyclic monomers, such as 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD), phosphazenes, organic acid, N-heterocyclic carbenes, N’-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N-cyclohexylthiourea (TU) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) [17–24]. Unfortunately, some organocatalysts (such as DMAP and TBD) can also exhibit a certain level of cytotoxicity [25,26]. To address these issues, a harmless catalyst with low cost and remarkable polymerization performance is urgently needed. Recently, several natural products as safe and economic catalysts have been used for the ROP of cyclic monomers due to their harmless and without metal residues. For instance, Liu et al. found that some amino acids (including, l-alanine, l-proline, l-phenylalanine and l-leucine) could initiate the ROP of ε-caprolactone (CL) [27]. Zinck et al. used adenine as a catalyst to achieve the ROP of lactide (LA) [28]. In contrast to these mono-functional natural products, the bifunctional trimethyl glycine (TMG) exhibits higher reactivity in the ROP of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) [29]. However, the detailed ROP mechanism of TMC, the main influencing factor of polymerization activity, and the origin of low activity for LA polymerization by TMG remain unclear. These problems are the main reasons that hinder the application of bifunctional natural product catalysts in the ROP of cyclic monomers. To identify efficient natural product for ROP of cyclic monomers, a theoretical calculation to understand the doubts is necessary. DFT computation can provide valuable insights into the ROP of cyclic monomers by organocatalysts [30–34]. For example, Coralie et al. showed that the reason why the slower ROP of LA catalyzed by benzoic acid (BA) than that of CL is the sterichindrance of the methyl group at the propagation chain end and the α-position methyl group of LA [35]. Another study on the ROP of γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) catalyzed by urea and alkoxide catalytic system. The mechanism revealed that the urea with electron-donating group exhibits a lower energy barrier in the rate-determined step than that of urea with the electron-accepting group, which indicates higher catalytic activity [36]. Furthermore, the DFT can also reveal the natural product catalyzed ROP mechanism of cyclic monomers and design catalytic system. For example, Hedrick et al. revealed that the (-)-sparteine chirality had essentially no effect on the ROP of LA [37]. Luo et al. designed a green and highly efficient adenine/sac for the rapid ROP of LA and TMC [38]. In this study, theoretical computational studies on the ROP of cyclic monomers catalyzed by TMG and tetramethylammonium acetate (TMAA) were conducted. The main factors affecting catalytic activity were elucidated by analyzing the geometric structure and electronic factors of the key transition state. Based on this funding, a series of zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules ((CH3)3 +N(CH2)nCOO‒) (n = 1‒5) with different carbon spacer lengths for the ROP of TMC was systematically investigated. It was found that extending carbon spacer lengths between CH3COO‒ and N(CH3)4 + of TMG significantly enhanced the ability of proton-accepting of the CH3COO‒. Guided by the DFT, the (CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒ was prepared and its catalytic performance in LA polymerization was verified. This study will provide theoretical insights into the development of the high-performance natural organocatalyst systems for the synthesis of polyesters and polycarbonates. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The ROP mechanism of TMC catalyzed by TMG and TMMA The mechanism of the ROP of TMC catalyzed by TMG (Fig. S1) was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 (the energy profiles of in G scale as shown in Fig. S2), a ternary initial complex 1A comprising TMG hydrogen-bonding to both TMC and initiator PPA (Ph(CH2)3OH), which is more stable (−12.6 kcal mol-1) than the original reactants. In 1A (Figs. 1a and S3), the H1−O1 bond in PPA is activated by CH3COO‒ of TMG via hydrogen bond interaction (H1···O2 distance of 1.76 Å), and the N(CH3)4 + of TMG bonds to the carbonyl group of TMC through triple hydrogen-bonding interactions, as suggested by H2···O4 (2.64 Å), H3···O4 (2.31 Å), and H4···O4 (2.59 Å). In addition, the H5 of TMC and O1 of PPA (H5···O1 contact of 2.39 Å) was connected by hydrogen bonding interaction. Subsequently, the Ph(CH2)3O‒ of PPA makes nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of TMC via a transition state TS1_2A (Fig. S3) with an energy barrier of 24.8 kcal mol-1 to afford an unstable tetrahedral intermediate 2A . In 2A (Figs. 1a and S3), the oxyanion of TMC is stabilized by TMG through triple bond interactions (H2···O4 (2.29 Å), H3···O4 (2.06 Å), and H4···O4 (2.15 Å)), where the H1 proton of PPA transferred to the CH3COO‒ of TMG. Subsequently, the TMGH+ transfer from O1 to O3 via a TS2_3A with an energy barrier of 24.9 kcal mol-1 and finally form 3A (Fig. S3), where the H1···O1 was broken and the H1···O3 (1.50 Å) was formed (Fig. 1a). In this step, the C1‒O3 bond of TMC is stretched from 1.44 to 1.52 Å, suggesting that H1···O3 facilitates the ring-opening of the tetrahedral intermediate via a barrierless pathway, resulting in the formation of a more stable 4A (Fig. 1a) . During this transformation, the triple hydrogen-bonding interactions become weaker (the average distance of O4···H(2/3/4) is 2.44 Å in 4A larger than 2.13 Å in 3A ) and the H1 proton transfers to O3 of TMC ring (Fig. 1). To further explore the ROP mechanism, the chain propagation process of TMC polymerization was also calculated. As shown in Fig. 1b, the coordination of the second TMC and the dissociation of the chain-end opened TMC in 4A to give a more stable complex 5A , which releases an energy of 2.3 kcal mol-1. This suggests that the 4A readily combines with the second TMC. From 5A to 8A , the energy barriers of nucleophilic attack, intermolecular H-bond rearrangement, and ring-opening process are 25.3, 25.2, and 21.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Based on the above calculations, the TMG catalyzed ROP of TMC follows a bifunctional mechanism. The CH3COO‒ of TMG plays different roles in the nucleophilic attack, intermolecular H-bond rearrangement, and ring-opening processes. In the nucleophilic attack process, the CH3COO‒ of TMG grabs the H+ of initiator PPA to form a tetrahedral intermediate (2A or 6A ). In the intermolecular H-bond rearrangement process, the CH3COOH of TMGH+ transfers from O1 to O3 (TS2_3A ) or from O3 to O3’ (TS6_7A ) to form 3A or 7A under thermodynamic drive. In the ring-opening process, the CH3COOH of TMGH+ transfers H+ to TMC, facilitating the breaking of the C−O3 (TMC) bond to form 4A or 8A. In the overall process, the N(CH3)4 + of TMG activates TMC via triple hydrogen bond interactions (O4···H(2/3/4) or O4’···H(2/3/4)). Based on the whole energy profile, it was concluded that the nucleophilic attack overcomes a higher energy barrier (25.3 kcal mol-1) than those of intermolecular H-bond rearrangement and ring-opening events. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack during the chain propagation is rate-determining step. In order to investigate the effect of catalysts with the same functional group on the ROP activity of TMC, the tetramethylammonium acetate (TMAA) (Fig. S1) was selected as the catalyst and the PPA as the initiator. The energetic paths of chain initiation and propagation are shown in Fig. 2 . The calculation results reveal that the ROP catalyzed by TMAA follows the same mechanism as that of TMG. A stable 1B (Fig. S4) of the ternary components TMC/TMAA/PPA is exergonic by ‒14.9 kcal mol-1 relative to the raw chemicals, which is attributed to the formation of hydrogen bond. The PPA activated by CH3COO‒ of TMAA to nucleophilic attacks the TMC via a TS1_2B (Fig. S4) with an energy barrier of 18.2 kcal mol-1, thereby yielding an unstable tetrahedral intermediate 2B . In TS1_2B , the oxyanion of TMC is stabilized through three hydrogen bond interactions, where the O4···H(2/3/4) distances of 2.49, 2.08, 2.14 Å, respectively. Then, the 2B then comes across a TS2_3B (Fig. S4) to isomerize to 3B by H1 of CH3COOH transfer from O1 to O3. The 3B is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds (O4···H(2/3/4)) and facilitates the ring-opening of TMC to form 4B. The TS3_4B is the rate-determining step, where the CH3COOH of TMAA transfers H+ to O3 of the TMC ring, facilitating the breaking of the C−O3 bond . Chain propagation involves the 4B binding with the second TMC to produce the 5B (Fig. 2b). This step is calculated to be exergonic by 4.4 kcal mol-1, suggesting that the binding of the second TMC to 4B is favorable. It is similar to the chain initiation stage, based on the 5B , successive nucleophilic attack, intermolecular H-bond rearrangement, ring-opening processes happen with the energy barriers of 18.1, 20.9, and 20.7 kcal mol-1, respectively. On the basis of the whole energy profile, it is concluded that the ring-opening process overcomes a higher energy barrier than the nucleophilic attack. Therefore, the ring-opening is rate-determining step. The calculation demonstrated that TMAA has a lower energy barrier than TMG (20.7 vs 25.3 kcal mol-1), suggesting the TMAA exhibits higher activity than TMG. To clarify the difference, the geometries structure of nucleophilic attack transition states TS5_6A and TS5_6B were compared (Fig. 3 ). The average distance (Davg of O4’···H (2/3/4)) between N(CH3)4 + in TMAA and TMG and TMC was compared. Actually, the Davg of O4’···H (2/3/4) in TS5_6A (TMG) and TS5_6B (TMAA) are the same (2.22 Å), indicating that the N(CH3)4 + part of TMG or TMAA is not the main factor affecting for the polymerization activity difference. However, the bigger discrepancy of H1···O2(CH3COO‒) in TS5_6B (1.06 Å) and TS5_6A (1.14 Å) confirms that the CH3COO‒ in TMAA and TMG with different the proton-accepting ability, which is the main factor affecting the polymerization activity. Except for the bond lengths, Mulliken charges are also an important factor in illustrating the catalytic activity. The Mulliken charges of the O2 atom (‒0.379 C) on the CH3COO‒ of TMAA is more negative than that in TMG (‒0.311 C), which drives the H+ transfer from PPA to the anion part of TMAA (Fig. S5). The analysis of structural and electronic factors indicates that the proton-accepting ability of the CH3COO‒ in TMAA and TMG is the main reason for their differing catalytic activities. 2.2 Design of catalyst based on the TMG To investigate the effect of carbon spacer lengths in TMG on the catalytic activity of the ROP of TMC, the energy barriers of nucleophilic attack for a series of zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules ((CH3)3 +N(CH2)nCOO‒) (n = 1(TMG), 2(T1), 3(T2), 4(T3), 5(T4)) (Fig. 4 ) were calculated, respectively. The results demonstrated that the energy barriers of transition states TST1 5_6A, TST2 5_6A, TST3 5_6A , and TST4 5_6A are 20.6, 18.0, 16.8 and 18.8 kcal mol-1, respectively (Fig. 5 a-d). Compared to the energy barrier of TMG, all the designed catalysts are decreased, especially, the T3 ((CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒) shows the lowest energy barrier. The difference in the energy barrier was determined by the Mulliken charge of the CH3COO‒ in the zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules. The calculation results indicated that the Mulliken charges of the anion part in TMG and T1‒4 are ‒0.647, ‒0.867, ‒0.885, ‒0.953 and ‒0.931 C (Fig. S6), respectively. Specifically, when carbon spacer length is ≤4, as the carbon spacer lengths increase, the Mulliken charge of the CH3COO‒ part becomes more negative, resulting in an enhancement of hydrogen bond interactions between the CH3COO‒ part and PPA. Thus, the CH3COO‒ is inclined to grab the H proton of initiator PPA. However, when the carbon spacer length is equal to 5, the Mulliken charge of CH3COO‒ tends to become more positive, making it difficult for CH₃COO⁻ to attract the H proton of initiator PPA. Therefore, further extending the carbon spacer lengths cannot prompt catalytic activity improvement. These results confirmed that the carbon spacer lengths will affect the catalytic activity of the zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules. To examine the catalytic activity of the TMG and T3, the representative example of the ROP of LA was investigated. According to the ROP mechanism of TMC catalyzed by TMG, the nucleophilic attack in the chain propagation is the rate-controlling step. Here, we calculated the energy barriers of the nucleophilic attack transition state to evaluate the catalytic activity of TMG and T3 for the ROP of LA. As indicated in Fig. 6 , the energy barrier of TS5_6C and TST3 5_6C are 27.2 and 18.6 kcal mol-1, which means the T3 exhibits higher catalytic activity than TMG for the ROP of LA. The low energy barrier of TST3 5_6C contributes to the enhanced proton-accepting ability of the anion part in T3. This is reflected in the fact that the Mulliken charges of anion in T3 (‒0.953 C) are more negative than that in TMG (‒0.647 C) and the distance of H1···O2 in TST3 5_6C (1.03 Å) is shorter than that in TS5_6C (1.10 Å) (Fig. 6). Based on theoretical calculation regarding the catalytic activity of T3 for the ROP of LA, the polymerization experiment was carried out to verify its high activity. Guided by the theoretical prediction, poly(lactide) (PLA) was synthesized by the ROP method with an initial [LA]0/[PPA]0/[(CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒] ratio of 100/1/1 under 100 °C in solvent-free conditions. The used raw chemicals and specific experimental processes can be found in SI. As shown in Table 1 , the LA conversion reached 88 %, indicating that (CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒ (T3) efficiently prompts the ROP of LA with lower catalyst loading and shorter reaction time in contrast to the TMG. From the 1H NMR spectrum of the obtained PLA, we can clearly observe the signal of the main chain of PLA and minor signals of the 3-phenyl-1-propoxy group (Fig. S7), indicating that T3 served as a catalyst while PPA acted as an initiator during the ROP of LA. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) trace of the prepared PLA is monomodal, and the molecular weight (Mn, GPC) is 6685 g mol-1 (Mn = 3877 g mol-1 after calibrated by the correcting factor of 0.58), which is larger than that of the obtained PLA catalyzed by catalyst TMG (Table 1). Moreover, the dispersity (Đ) value is 1.11 (Fig. S8 and Table 1). These results confirm that T3 has better catalytic ability than TMG for the ROP of LA. Therefore, the investigated (CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒ catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity for the ROP of LA, resulting in PLA that exhibits good control over the molecular weight and yield. In this sense, extending the carbon spacer lengths of zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules presents a promising approach for catalyzing the ROP of cyclic monomers. 4 Conclusions In summary, the DFT calculations and experiments investigated the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers by zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) TMG and TMAA via bifunctional activation mechanism to catalyze the ROP of TMC, where the CH3COO‒ prompts the nucleophilic attack and ring-opening process by H+ transfer, and the N(CH3)4 + stabilizes the TMC through triple hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, the CH3COO‒ plays a key role in catalytic activity. (2) DFT calculations reveal that catalytic performance of the zwitterionic carboxybetaine catalyst could be improved by extending the carbon spacer lengths, as this shortens the distance between H1 (PPA) and O2 (CH3COO‒) and cause the Mulliken charge of the anion part to become more negative. In the ROP of TMC catalyzed by (CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒, the Mulliken charge of the anion part is ‒0.953 C and the energy barrier is 16.8 kcal mol-1, resulting in higher catalytic activity than TMG. (3) Compared to the rate-determining step of ROP of LA catalyzed by TMG and (CH3)3 +N(CH2)4COO‒, the results show that the energy barrier for the latter (18.6 kcal mol-1) is lower than that for the former (27.2 kcal mol-1). Furthermore, the experimental results indicated that prepared PLA possesses the molecular weight of 6685 g mol-1 and the dispersity (Đ) value is 1.11. We expect that the strategy of extending the carbon spacer lengths between the cation and anion of zwitterionic carboxybetaine will contribute to the design of green catalysts and the application of these catalysts in the ROP of cyclic monomers.

        "dc:description": "Organic catalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters and carbonates is an effective strategy for obtaining biodegradable and biocompatible aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates. The challenge is to develop highly active and green organocatalysts in this domain. Herein, the zwitterionic carboxybetaine catalyzed the ROP mechanism of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) cyclic ester and lactide (LA) was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). By comparing the ROP of TMC catalyzed by natural trimethyl glycine (TMG) and unnatural tetramethylammonium acetate (TMAA), we found the proton-accepting ability of the anion part in zwitterionic carboxybetaine is the main influencing factor of polymerization activity. Based on this finding, it is proposed to enhance the proton-accepting ability of the anion part in TMG by extending carbon spacer lengths between CH3COO‒ and N(CH3)4 + of TMG. Among them zwitterionic carboxybetaine molecules ((CH3)3N+(CH2)nCOO‒ (n = 1–5)), the (CH3)3N+(CH2)4COO‒ shows the highest catalytic activity in the ROP of TMC. Moreover, the ROP of LA catalyzed by (CH3)3N+(CH2)4COO‒ showed very high catalytic activity compared to the TMG in both theoretical calculation and experiment. This work will inspire the future development of natural organocatalysts with high catalytic performance.",
