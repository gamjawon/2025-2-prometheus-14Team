L. PELT, J. J. J. J. BROCKHUS*, R. P. J. VERBURG and J. J. F. SCHOLTEN** Department of Chemical Technology, Delft University of Technology, Julianalaan 136, 2628 BL Delft (The Netherlands) (Received May 21, 1984) Summary During hydroformylation of alkenes in a fixed bed flow reactor over supported liquid-phase rhodium catalysts, the alkanals produced dissolve into the liquid phase of the catalyst, triphenylphosphine (PPh3). In this article the solubility data of n-pentanal in PPh3 are presented, together with data on the influence of n-pentanal addition on the solubility in PPh3 of CO, Hi and but-1-ene. The consequences of alkanal dissolution for the performance of the catalysts are discussed. Introduction In supported liquid-phase rhodium catalysts (Rh SLPC) used in the hydroformylation of alkenes, schematically represented in Fig. 1, we deal, in principle at least, with three classes of rhodium complexes: (a) those at the gas-liquid interface; (b) those dissolved in the solvent-ligand PPh3; (c) those physically or chemically adsorbed at the liquid-solid inter- face. Gerritsen et al. [l], who studied the hydroformylation of ethene and propene over Rh SLP catalysts, showed the reaction not to be diffusionally retarded in the capillary-condensed liquid phase of the catalyst. Nevertheless, these authors arrived at the conclusion that mainly the rhodium complexes in the gas-liquid interface are catalytically active, the inactivity of the dis- solved complexes being due to coordination with more PPh3 ligands than the *Present address : Unichema, Gouda, The Netherlands. **Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed; also affiliated to the Dept. of Catalysis, Central Laboratories, DSM, Geleen, The Netherlands. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 108 Fig. 1. Schematic representation of a SLP rhodium catalyst. S = support material, G = gas-phase (alkene, CO and H^), L = liquid-phase (PPh3 and dissolved alkanal), l = complex in the meniscus (gas-liquid interface), 2 = complex dissolved in the bulk of the liquid, 3 = complex adsorbed at the liquid-solid interface. complexes in the gas-liquid interface. Hence, it was concluded that RhHCO- (PPh3)3 dissolved in excess PPh3 is catalytically inactive. An exception was made for the complexes in the gas-liquid interface, since these complexes are in direct contact with the carbon monoxide gas molecules, and part of their PPh3 ligands are exchanged for CO ligands. In their calculations Gerritsen et al. [l] took into account the diffusion coefficients and solubilities of the reactants in PPh3, viz. alkene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. However, they overlooked the fact that the alkanal will dissolve into the capillary-condensed PPh3 to a considerable extent, especially when working at higher conversions per pass. This entails three possible consequences: (1) Too much alkanal is capillary-condensed into the pores, besides the PPh3 already present, and thus the maximum degree of pore filling (5 = l) is exceeded. If this should occur, the expensive rhodium complex is leached out. In order to prevent this, the partial pressure of the alkanal has to remain below a certain limit, corresponding with a degree of pore filling lower than one. (2) As shown by Gerritsen et al. [l], and further confirmed by our own measurements [2], a part of the rhodium complexes are adsorbed at the liquid-solid interface. The question arises as to whether the dissolved alkanal influences the extent of the rhodium complex adsorption. (3) Dilution of the rhodium complex solution in PPh3 by capillary- condensed alkanal may influence the position of the equilibria between the various dissolved rhodium complexes. In view of the above considerations, we decided to measure the solu- bility in PPh3 of n-pentanal, the main product of our but-1-ene hydro- formylation studies, as a function of temperature and n-pentanal pressure. 109 Moreover, we investigated to what extent the presence of n-pentanal influ- ences the solubility in PPh3 of the reactants, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and but-1-ene. Finally we examined the influence of a co-solvent on the extent of rhodium complex adsorption on the support materials a-alumina, 7-alumina and silica. Experimental Materials n-Pentanal, from Fluka A.G., F.R.G., purity 99%, was distilled under nitrogen before use. Triphenylphosphine (Merck, F.R.G., 98%) was used as received. RhHCO(PPh3)3 was prepared according to the method of Ahmad et al. [3], But-1-ene (99.5%), nitrogen (99.9%) and hydrogen (99.99%), were obtained from Hoek Loos N.V., The Netherlands, and carbon monoxide (99.5%) from Air Products, U.S.A. Polyethylene glycol (purity > 98%), type PEG-200 with a mean molecular weight of 200, was supplied by Merck, F.R.G. The support materials a-alumina SA 5202, 7-alumina 000-1, 5E and silica 000-3E, were the same as those used in our preceding study; their suppliers are listed in Table 1 and their texture and sodium content in Table 2 of ref. 2. Solubility determinations The solubility of n-pentanal in triphenylphosphine, at temperatures in between 353 and 393 K, was determined by means of a tensiometer. The solubilities of the reactants hydrogen, carbon monoxide and but-1-ene, in liquid triphenylphosphine admixed with varying amounts of n-pentanal, were determined by means of a Cailletet apparatus, described by Lemkowitz etal. [4]. A detailed account of this experimental part of our work will be published elsewhere [5]; a good description of similar previous work dealing with the solubility of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ethene and propene in triphenylphosphine, is reported in ref. 6. Determination of adsorption isotherms Adsorption isotherms of the rhodium complex from a triphenylphos- phine melt on various supports in the presence of a co-solvent were per- formed as described in ref. 2. To determine its effect, the co-solvent is brought into the apparatus together with the solvent ligand PPh3. Results and discussion The solubility of n-pentanal in triphenylphosphine The results of the n-pentanal solubility determinations at 343, 363 and 383 K are plotted in Fig. 2. The difference between the experimental and calculated data is less than 5%. 110 Fig. 2.

Maximum allowable but-1-ene conversions, ^maxi as a function of reaction temper- ature T, calculated for maximum total pressures of 0.5 MPa, 1.1 MPa and 1.5 MPa. The initial degree of pore filling with PPh3 is assumed to be 0.5. H2:CO:but-l-ene = 1:1:1. (a):PT=0.5MPa,(b):PT= 1.1 MPa, (c): PT= 1.6 MPa. Starting from the data in Fig. 2, we estimated the amount of admixed n-pentanal in the liquid PPh3 in a Rh-SLPC under the conditions of our but-1-ene hydro formylation experiments. It then appears that at 363 K and a but-1-ene conversion corresponding to a partial n-pentanal pressure of 45 kPa, the number of admixed n-pentanal molecules is equal to the number of PPh3 molecules. This means that, starting from a degree of PPh3 pore filling of 0.5 in the fresh catalyst, the degree of pore filling will rise to 0.8. We have taken into account in these calculations the molar volumes of n-pentanal and PPh3 to be, respectively, 115 and 244 cm3 mor1. It follows that partial n- pentanal pressures higher than 45 kPa are hardly feasible at this temperature (90 C), otherwise leaching out of the catalyst from the support will occur. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2, we calculated the maximum allow- able but-1-ene conversions as a function of reaction temperature, corre- sponding to a degree of pore filling of one (PPh3 plus n-pentanal), starting from an initial PPh3 degree of pore filling of 0.5 (see Fig. 3). When choosing experimental conditions, for instance a reaction temperature of 373 K and a total pressure of 1.1 MPa, it appears from Fig. 3 that the maximum allow- able but-1-ene conversion never exceeds ca. 15%. Consequently one might consider the choice of a still lower initial PPh3 pore filling to be advantageous. However, calculations show that the maxi- mum allowable but-1-ene conversion increases only slightly by this ploy (see Fig. 4). Ill 100 50 0.5 1.0 butene-1 Fig. 4.

The initial degree of PPh3 pore filling is 0.5. (a):PT=0.5MPa,(b):PT=l OMPa,(c):PT= 1.5 MPa. The only way to obtain higher but-1-ene conversions per pass is to strongly diminish the partial but-1-ene pressure in the feed; this is demon- strated in Fig. 5, by calculated maximum conversions, at various total pressures and partial but-1-ene pressures. The n-pentanal production may only be increased by increasing the reaction temperature.

(l) where , is the fugacity of the gas, .x, is the mole fraction of the gas in the liquid phase and 7, is the activity coefficient of the dissolved gas in the liquid phase. Figure 6 shows that, for mole fractions of n-pentanal in the liquid from 0 - 0.12, and in the range of temperatures 364 - 394 K, the solubilities of hydrogen and of carbon monoxide are hardly influenced by admixture of n-pentanal to PPh3. The solubility of but-1-ene, on the other hand, is more strongly influenced by dissolution of n-pentanal (see Fig. 6). On theoretical grounds, discussed elsewhere [ 5 ], it is to be expected that the solubility at 363 K of but-1-ene, and of carbon monoxide, and to a lesser extent the solubility of hydrogen, increases with increasing mole fraction of n-pentanal above ca. .tn-pentanai = 0-2. On increasing the degree of but-1-ene conversion, the partial n-pentanal pressure in the flow reactor increases, and hence more of the alkanal is dissolved in the catalyst. It is likely that this will influence the but-1-ene hydroformylation kinetics. 112 4.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 2.4 2,5 2.6 2.7 2.8 1000 -1, Fig. 6.

Fig. 7. Extent of equilibrium rhodium complex adsorption, at the liquid-solid interface PPh3/support material, as influenced by admixture of polyethylene glycol PEG-200, at 363 K. Before admixing PEG-200, the rhodium complex equilibrium concentration in PPh3 was 20 mol Rh m\"3; (a): on a-alumina SA 5202, (b): on 7-alumina 000-1,5E, (c): on silica 000-3E. The amounts of adsorbed complex in this Figure, at 0% glycol added, correspond with the adsorption equilibria at 20 mol Rh m\"3 in Figs. 5 and 7 of ref. 2. The influence of a co-solvent on the complex adsorption at the solid-liquid interface in a Rh SLPC In our previous article [2] we showed that in a Rh SLPC the Wilkinson complex is withdrawn from the solvent ligand PPh3 by chemical adsorption at the solid-liquid interface. The extent of adsorption and the nature of the adsorptive bond depends on the type of support material used. We may ask to what degree dissolution of alkanals into the liquid PPha in the catalyst during hydroformylation will influence the extent of the com- plex adsorption presented in [ 2]. Unfortunately, experiments with n-pentanal as a co-solvent are hampered by the high volatility of this compound. There- fore, additional experiments with polyethylene glycol PEG-200 as a co- solvent were performed. Results are presented in Fig. 7. Curve (a) in Fig. 7 shows that on increasing the weight percentage of PEG-200 in PPh3, the amount of adsorbed rhodium complex on a-A^Oa SA 5202 remains constant. Obviously the rhodium complexes, which are con- sidered to be bound to the surface of the support via ligand exchange of the PPh3 ligands and Lewis basic O2\" groups (see [2]), are so strongly at- tached to the support that they are not displaced by PEG-200. In hydro- 113 formylation with a Rh-SLPC and a-alumina as a support, addition of poly- ethylene glycol will not influence the extent of the rhodium complex adsorption, and hence the catalytic activity is expected to remain constant. If y-alumina 000-1,5E is chosen as a support (curve (b) in Fig. 7), a dif- ferent result is obtained. Now co-adsorption of PEG-200 lowers the extent of rhodium complex adsorption, by as much as a factor of co. 2 at the highest PEG-200 concentration in our measurements. If we assume that the rhodium complexes chemisorbed at the solid-liquid interface are catalytically eliminated, pre-addition of PEG-200 will have a positive effect on the activity of the catalyst. As follows from curve (c) in Fig. 7, the same reasoning as applied for 'y-alumina holds for the use of silica 000-3E as a support. Our conclusion with respect to the beneficial influence of PEG-200 addition is in agreement with results published by Gerritsen et al. [9] deal- ing with the hydroformylation of propene over silica-supported SLP cata- lysts, where it was shown that addition of 10 vol.% PEG-200 to the catalyst increases the catalytic activity by a factor of 1.5. It is to be expected that alkanal as a co-solvent will have a beneficial influence similar to that found for PEG-200. A limited number of relative- ly inaccurate measurements with n-pentanal, not given here, supported this supposition. The activity and selectivity of the rhodium complexes in the SLPC, as influenced by the uptake of n-pentanal in the catalyst According to Ostwald's dilution law, addition of n-pentanal to the rhodium complex solution in PPha in our SLPC might result m the dis- sociative removal of PPl^ ligands. For example, in the PPh3 solution the equilibrium: RhHCO(PPh3)3 ^==1 RhHCO(PPh3)2 + PPh3 might shift to the right when n-pentanal is taken up in the catalyst. As is generally known, a lowering of the number of PPh3 ligands around the rhodium center in the complex results m a lowering of the linear .-branched alkanal ratio in hydroformylation, and in a simultaneous increase of the catalytic activity of the complex. From our but-1-ene hydroformylation experiments over a rhodium - SLPC [10], it was found that an intentional increase of the initial degree of pore filling from 0.5 up to 1.0, by addition of n-pentanal to the feed, resulted in a decrease of the linear: branched ratio from 20 to 15, with an attendant increase of the catalytic activity per rhodium complex of about 10%. Hence, in our SLP catalysts, the effect of dilution is relatively low, and compares favourably with that reported on homogeneous but-1-ene hydroformylation by the Low-Pressure-Oxo (LPO) process [11]; due to the presence of n-pentanal and trimers, the rhodium complex concentra- tion in the LPO process is 25 times lower, and in consequence the linear: branched ratio of alkanals has the relatively low value of 10. 114 The influence of the degree of pore filling on the catalytic activity of rhodium SLP catalysts Based on our fresh insights into the adsorption of rhodium complexes at the liquid-solid interface [2], and from our new knowledge on the influence of co-solvents on rhodium complex adsorption, we now can renew the discussion of Gerritsen's results on the influence of the degree of pore filling on the catalytic activity [9]. For convenience we reproduce in Fig. 8 his results for ethene hydroformylation over Rh SLP catalysts, applying various supports. Curve (a) in Fig. 8 describes the activity change as a function of 8 for XAD-2 as a support. The catalytic activity per unit weight of rhodium is appreciably higher than that found for all other supports. This must be due to the fact that there is very little, if any, adsorptive withdrawal of rhodium complexes at the solid-liquid interface [2]. Curve (a) shows that on proceed- ing from 5 = 0.05 to o = 1, the activity decreases by a factor ofca. 2. Gerritsen et al. [9] stated that only the rhodium complexes in the meniscus (the gas- liquid interface) are catalytically active. If this is true a much stronger decline of activity would have occured, for the BET surface area of the catalyst decreases from 165 m2 g\"' to only a few m2 g~1 on proceeding from o = 0.05 to 5=1. We therefore conclude that we are not dealing with exclusive meniscus catalysis. In the PPh3 solution, as well as at the gas- Fig. 8.

The BET surface area of the gas-liquid interface of a silica OOO-SE-supported Rh SLP catalyst, as influenced by the PPh3 degree of pore filling. Taken from Table 2, ref. 9. liquid interface, catalytically active rhodium complexes are present. The complexes in the interface are more active, but less selective, than those in the PPh3 solution. This is caused by the difference in PPh3 coordination. Curve (b) in Fig. 8 describes the change in the activity for silica 000-3E as a support. The most striking fact is that for all 0-values the activity level is at least a factor of two lower than for XAD-2 as a support. This is related to the fact that, in contrast to XAD-2, silica 000-3E shows adsorptive rhodium complex withdrawal at the solid-liquid interface (see adsorption isotherm 1 in Fig. 7, ref. 2). Gradually more complexes remain in solution when the degree of pore filling is increased [2], and the activity rises to a maximum value of ca. 180 cm3 ethene per g rhodium per s at 6 = 0.3. It follows that the part of the complexes which are adsorbed are catalytically eliminated, or have an appreciably lower activity. As argued above for the case of XAD-2 as a support, a description of curve (b) in terms of exclusive catalysis at the gas-liquid interface has to be ruled out. In Fig. 9 the surface area of silica 000-3E-supported catalysts is plotted as a function of the PPh3 pore filling. It is seen that, on proceeding from 5 = 0.3 to 5 = 1.0, the surface area decreases from 100 m2 g~1 to nearly l m2 g71. However, an activity decline by a factor of 100 is not observed in this range of 0 values; the catalytic activity remains constant. Curve (c) in Fig. 8 represents Gerritsen's results with a strongly acidic silica-alumina support. The low activities measured point to catalytic elim- ination of the largest part of the rhodium complexes by destructive chemi- sorption on the strongly acidic sites of the support. This is in accordance with the adsorption isotherm of RhHCO(PPh3)3 in molten PPh3 on this sup- port, given in Fig. 2 of ref. 9; the steep rise in the isotherm at low complex concentrations is an indication for very strong adsorption. Curve (d) in Fig. 8 shows the activity of the SLP catalysts with 7- alumina 005-0,75E as a support as a function of the degree of pore filling. The course of the curve is similar to that found with silica-supported cata- 116 lysts. Due to the stronger complex adsorption, discussed in [2], the activity is much lower than if silica is used as a support. Curve (e) applies to a-alumina SA 5202. The experimental conditions are the same as for the other curves, except for a rhodium complex concen- tration of 100 mol m\"3. Calculation shows that at 5 = 0.1 even 80% of the complexes are chemisorbed at the liquid-solid interface, but this has only little influence on the catalytic activity. The increase in the activity, if the degree of pore filling is decreased, is analogous with the use of XAD-2. It is very likely, therefore, that the complexes bound via 02--PPh3 ligand ex- change are not catalytically eliminated. Conclusions The idea developed by Gerritsen et al. [9] that exclusively the rhodium complexes in the meniscus are active, was based on the observation that, on passing from the liquid to the solid state of PPh3 in a SLPC, neither the apparent activation energy nor the pre-exponential factor describing the kinetics of propene hydro formylation underwent any alteration. Further- more, the activity of a solid-state non-supported catalyst (the rhodium complex dissolved in solid PPh3) was measured, and the same apparent activation energy was found as in the case of a supported solution of the rhodium complex in liquid PPhg. On the basis of the alkanal solubility measurements presented in this article, it is now clear that the produced alkanals dissolve into the triphenyl- phosphine. Obviously in most experiments by Gerritsen et al. the catalyst was actually in the liquid state due to the uptake of alkanal. This fact makes their conclusions untenable. Moreover, starting with a catalyst in which the PPh3 solution was in the solid state (e.g. starting with a fresh catalyst at room temperature) Gerritsen et al. [9] found that there is a jump in the pre-exponential factor of the propylene hydroformylation kinetic equation around the PPh3 melting point. It is likely that around this temperature more butyraldehyde is taken up by the PPh3, by which the catalyst activity increased by a factor of 1.7. Hjortkjaer et al. [13] observed that the rate of reaction is very strongly dependent on whether or not PPh3 is present in a liquid state. On increasing the temperature for an unsupported catalyst system from 50 to 90 C the rate increases ca. 70-fold, and a similar decrease in rate is observed on cool- ing again to 50 \"C. This observation might be explained by a large difference in activity of complexes in a solid or in a liquid meniscus. However, the change in the solubility of butyraldehyde in PPh3 at 50 C as compared to that at 90 C may play a role as well. From the results presented in this article, we conclude that supports such as the macroreticular resin XAD-2 are the best choice with respect to maximum rhodium utilization. Furthermore, a high degree of PPh3 pore filling, combined with a high rhodium concentration, ensures a high 117 conversion per unit reactor volume, but solubility data of alkanal in PPh3 have to be taken with care that soaking of the catalyst, by increasing the initial PPh3 degree of pore filling by the dissolved alkanal to values of 0 above one, does not occur. The effects of additional solvents other than the hydrofonnylation products have been extensively studied by Hjortkjaer et al. [13]. These authors demonstrated that, whether or not beneficial effects of co-solvents were seen, these effects were very dependent on the initial liquid PPh3 loading. These findings are in accordance with our experiences. The initial PPh3 loading strongly determines the ratio of the number of meniscus com- plexes to the number of dissolved complexes, and both types of complexes contribute to the performance of the catalyst. Moreover, dependent on the initial degree of pore filling, the influence of a co-solvent on the extent of adsorptive complex withdrawal will be different, and this factor will influ- ence the activity per unit weight of catalyst as well.

During hydroformylation of alkenes in a fixed bed flow reactor over supported liquid-phase rhodium catalysts, the alkanals produced dissolve into the liquid phase of the catalyst, triphenylphosphine (PPh3). In this article the solubility data of n-pentanal in PPh3 are presented, together with data on the influence of n-pentanal addition on the solubility in PPh3 of CO, H2 and but-1-ene. The consequences of alkanal dissolution for the performance of the catalysts are discussed. References 1 L.A. Gerritsen J.M. Herman W. Klut J.J.F. Scholten J. Mol. Catal. 9 1980 157 2 H.L.
