Box 213, DK-2800 Lyngby (Denmark) (Received June 1, 1993; accepted July 1,1993 ) Abstract 371 13C MAS NMR has been performed in situ to investigate the early stages in the conversion of propane to aromatics on Ga-containing ZSM-5 catalysts. Propane 2-'8C was used as labelled reactant. The scrambling of the 13C label in the very early stages of the propane conversion, even at 573 K, indicates that the first reaction intermediate is a protonated pseudocyclopropane (PPCP ) species formed by activation of propane on a (Ga9+,0'-)ion pair and its protonation by a nearby BrsnsO acidic site. This PPCP species can decompose in several ways leading to H2, CH4, C2H4, C2I16, and C3H8 as primary products. The very same molecules can also be produced as secondary products by cracking and hydrogen transfer at high conversion. CH3 , C2Hs and C3H7' carbenium ions which are formed by decomposition of PPCP can react further with alkane or olefmic species. Reaction of CH9 (stabilised by a basic anionic framework oxygen) with propane (activated on a Ga site) may yield n-butane as indicated by the increase in the n-butane/i-butane ratio when the catalyst contains gallium.

Introduction Dehydrocyclodimerisation converts light paraffins to aromatics, as was disclosed by Csicsery in the early seventies [ 1 j . This reaction is known to occur on pure acid catalysts (e.g., H-M71) or on bifunctional catalysts having a dehydrogenating and an acid function (e.g., Ga/H-MFI). As shown in Fig. 1, the aromatisations of liquefied natural gas (LPG) and light naphtha (LN) have different active sites requirements. The conversion of LPG to aromatics requires bifunctional catalysts where `Corresponding author.

Type of catalytic site: (A) acidic, (D) dehydrogenation, (T) hydrogen transfer. both acidic (A) and dehydrogenation (D) catalytic sites function in synergy. Acidic sites are necessary to condense C2-C6 hydrocarbons into higher (Cs+ ) hydrocarbons which can then dehydrogenate and cyclise to form aromatics. In contrast, the aromatisation of LN does not require acidic sites. For both LPG and LN aOmatisations, removal of hydrogen by recombinative desorption is highly desired on sites acting as H2-portholes (P) [2], mainly to minimise hydrogen transfer promoting the formation of unwanted by-products such as CH,, and CzHg. Acidic sites (A) promote a number of secondary reactions for both LPG and LN aromatisations, e.g., isomerisation of C4-C6 alkanes and C4-C10 olefins, and the cyclisation of Cg-Clo to form naphthenes or longer chain/branched alkanes. In addition, the acidic sites also promote the highly undesired cracking of products and intermediates to C,-C2 species. Consequently, it is obvious that acidic and dehydrogenation catalytic functions should be carefully balanced in the catalysts for the aromatisation of LPG and that acid activity should be avoided in the catalysts for the aromatisation of LN. These requirements explain the limited success of M2-forming (MOBIL) [3,4] and the rel- E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 373 atively low aromatic and high C1-CZ selectivities of AROFORMING (IFPSALUTEC) [5] for LN conversion (about 55% aromatic selectivity) compared to processes more specifically designed for the conversion of LPG (CYCLAR of BP-UOP [6,7] or LN (AROMAX of CHEVRON [8,9]) (both processes have aromatic selectivities of about 60% ). There is a fundamental reason why Ga-modified H-MFI catalysts, which perform well in dehydrocyclodimerisation of LPG are not ideal for LN aromatisation, as some gallium may be incorporated in the framework and generate Bronsted acidity, even in the absence of framework aluminium. The high methane yields observed in the aromatisation of LN over bifunctional catalysts increase dramatically the cost of hydrogen recovery and decrease the overall process economy. Describing the interplay between the acidic and dehydrogenating catalytic functions is thus of key importance in understanding the behaviour of model and industrial LPG aromatisation catalysts. Such information is vital for the design of catalysts with optimal selectivity, activity, and lifetime. Most of the research efforts dealt with Ga-modified H-MFI catalysts as evidenced by two recent reviews [5,10 ] . Although the conclusions of our work may be applicable to other systems, we will focus our contribution exclusively on the aromatisation of propane over Ga-modified H-MFI. We will not consider H-MFI catalysts moOed with dehydrogenating functions based on other elements such as Zn, Cr, V, etc... The overall conventional aromatisation pathway is described in Fig.1. Propane is first dehydrogenated to propene which is then di- or oligomerised, resulting in a pool of olefins. These olefins are then further dehydrogenated to naphthenes, aromatics, and eventually to undesired coke. Discrepancies exist in the literature between the various detailed mechanistic proposals. According to Ono et. al. [ 10,11 ], the initial step in the activation of propane involves acidic sites only, via the formation of carbonium ions as described by Haag and Dessau [ 12 ] . In contrast, Meriaudeau et al. favour a route involving dehydrogenation of propane on Ga species [ 13,14 ] as also proposed by Gnep et al. [ 15 ] and reviewed recently [ 5 ] . These Ga species are probably non-framework entities [ 14 ] . A general consensus exists about the acid-catalysed di- or oligomerisation of propene, combined with cracking, to yield a pool of olefins. Aromatics are eventually formed from these olefins by dehydrogenation to di- and tri-olefinic intermediates on Ga sites [ 16 ] or via naphthenic intermediates if both acidic and dehydrogenating sites operate [ 17 ] . The most important role of gallium recently disclosed is to provide a porthole for the recombination of abstracted hydrogen and its release as dihydrogen species [ 2 ] . The latter report complements earlier proposals by Inui [ 18 ] and Le Van Mao [19]. In this paper, we aim to clarify the mechanism by which propane is initially activated over Ga-modified H-ZSM-5 and to quantify the competition between cracking, dehydrogenation, and aromatisation in the dehydrocyclisation of propane. 374 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts MFI zeolites were crystallised in hydrothermal conditions from gels prepared by mixing silica, sodium aluminate, and TPABr [ 20 ] . The amount of sodium aluminate was varied to change the Al content of the zeolite. The products were calcined as usual in nitrogen and then air at 773 K (2 h). NH4exchange was performed with NH4C11 M. (Ga,H) -ZSM-5 catalysts, each with 1.6 wt.% Ga-loading, were prepared by impregnation of two NH4-ZSM-5 zeolites (1 g) differing by their Al content (Z234: Si/Al=18; 2356: Si/Al=128) with 5 ml of a 0.05 M gallium nitrate solution (pH=2.3; T=373 K; t-4 h). The materials were filtered, washed, and dried at 150 C overnight before calcination in air at 550 C (2 h). The Ga-modified catalysts are coded 2234 SL2 (2 impregnations) and 2356 SLl (1 impregnation), respectively. Three other H-MFI-based catalysts were used to investigate specifically the complementary roles of gallium and acidic sites in propane activation at 573 K. Gallium was also introduced to these catalysts via impregnation. These catalysts are H-MS40, a pure H-MFI material with Si/Al=35, Ga-MS40, HMFI with Si/A1=40 containing 1.02 wt.% of gallium, and Ga-MS76, H-MFI with Si/A1=480 and containing 0.95 wt.% of gallium. Hence, Ga-MS40 and H-MS40 differ by the presence of gallium in the former, whereas Ga-MS40 and Ga-MS76 have different amounts of aluminium sites but are similar with respect to gallium content. E.G.

Catalyst characterisation The catalysts were characterized extensively using solid state \"Ga, \"Al and 'Si MAS NMR, electron microscopy, XRF, XPS, EDX, Rutherford backacattering (RBS), sorption of n-hexane, and NH3 TPD. Surface segregation of Ga species in the unused catalysts was more important in 2356 SLl than in 2234 SL2 because of the lower ion-exchange capacity of the former. Thermal analysis and temperature programmed reduction provided complementary information on the chemical modification of the Ga species. These results are described and discussed elsewhere [21,22 ]. The combination of quantitative \"Al, 'Si, and \"Ga MAS NMR with NH3- TABLE 1 Distribution of some aluminium and gallium species in catalysts 2234 SL2 and 2356 SLl AIT/uc Ac. sites/uc GaT/uc Gao.=/uc Garw/uc (1) 2234 SL2 3.70 2.60 0.22 0.92 0.18 (2) 2356 SLl 1.14 0.99 0.15 0.25 0.92 Ratio (1):(2) 3.24 2.60 1.47 3.68 0.20 E.G Derouane et al. / J.

Thermodynamic calculations Thermodynamic calculations of propane conversion to an equilibrium mixture of CH4, CZH4, C~6, C3H8, C, H2, and C6Hg at a total pressure of 1 bar and in the temperature range 673-823 K were performed using the EquiTherm Basis 2.10 software (Verlag Chemie). 2.4. In situ 13C MAS NMR measurements The powdered catalysts samples (about 0.09 g) were packed into NMR cells (5.6 mm o.d.) with a constriction (Wilmad) fitting exactly double-bearing Bruker zirconia rotors. The catalysts were evacuated down to a final pressure of 6 X 10-'ss Torr after heating for 8 h at 573 K, and cooled down to 293 K before adsorbing 4 molecules (dosed volumetrically) of C3H8 2-13C (>99% enriched) per zeolite unit cell. The NMR cells, maintained at 77 K to avoid local overheating and to ensure a quantitative adsorption of propane, were then carefully sealed to achieve proper balance and high spinning rates in the MAS NMR probe. In situ 13C MAS NMR measurements were carried out with a MSL-400 Bruker spectrometer operating at 100.6 MHz for 13C. Quantitative conditions were achieved using high-power gated proton decoupling with suppressed NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect), 90 pulse, recycling delay=4 s. Spinning rate is 3000 rpm. A few non-lH-decoupled spectra were also recorded to identify some reaction intermediates and products. Cross-polarisation experiments were performed to distinguish between species with different mobilities, e.g., gas phase and adsorbed molecules. In the latter two cases, no attempt was made to quantify the results as only a qualitative response was needed. In a typical in situ labelled reactant reaction experiment, the sealed NMR cell is heated to selected and controlled higher temperatures in the range 573793 K, for progressively longer times. MAS NMR spectra are recorded at ambient temperature after rapid cooling of the sample. After collecting the NMR data, the sealed NMR cell is rapidly returned to reaction conditions. Kinetic information obtained from such experiments, i.e., activation energies and relative reaction rates, are compared with the microreactor data to validate the quantification of the NMR studies. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Nature and distribution of the aluminium and gallium species Detailed characterisation of the catalysts used in this investigation is available elsewhere [ 21,22 ] . Information needed in the following discussion is summarised below. 376 E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 The total amounts of Al atoms per unit cell are 5.36 for 2234 SL2 and 1.28 for 2356 SL1. The total Ga atoms per unit cell is 1.3 in each 2234 SL2 and 2356 SLI. The combination of quantitative 2' Al, 29Si, and '1Ga MAS NMR with NH3-TPD measurements leads to a detailed picture of the chemical distribution of the Al and Ga species. Aluminium is present as framework Al Tatoms (AIT), dislodged pentacoordinated (Alp) and non-framework octahedrally (Alo) coordinated, Al (Alp+o) species, and as other extraframework (AlEF) species. Gallium is found as T sites (Gar), as exchanged cations (Ga;one=), and as non-dispersed extraframework (GaND) Ga species. Note that dispersed non-framework Ga species (GaD) appear under reducing conditions (HZ or propane feed) [21,22 ]. Table 1 shows that: (1) The Ga ion-exchange used leads to about the same extent of Ga incorporation in the MFI framework for 2234 SL2 (0.22 GaT/uc (uc=unit cell)) and 2356 SM (0.15 Gar/uc). The amount of non-dispersed gallium extraframework species, GaND, is much larger for 2356 SM (0.92 Ga/uc) than for 2234 SL2 (0.18 Ga/uc). The number of ion-exchanged gallium, Ga;onea, is higher in 2234 SL2 (0.92 Ga/uc) than in 2356 SM (0.25 Ga/uc). 2234 SL2 and 2356 SM contain 3.70 and 1.14 aluminum sites (AIT) per unit cell, respectively. Thus, samples 2234 SL2 and 2356 SM differ essentially by the concentration of Bronsted acid sites, 2.6 times larger for 2234 SL2, the amount of ionexchanged gallium, 3.7 times larger for 2234 SL2, and the quantity of nondispersed gallium, probably present as Ga203, 5.1 times larger for 2356 SLl. (2) (3) (4) 3.2. Thermodynamic considerations The need has arisen, in the course of this work, to have a reliable thermodynamic description of propane conversion to various possible products in the temperature range 673-823 K, namely, because of the necessity to compare results obtained from continuous microreactor tests [ 21 ] to observations made in batch conditions (those in which the in situ NMR measurements were performed).

Derouane et aL / J Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 three reactions, (ii) aromatisation and dehydrogenation, and (iii) dehydrogenation only. It is observed that: (i) Propane dehydrogenation is the least thermodynamically favoured reaction at all temperatures. In the absence of cracking and aromatisation reactions, the equilibrium of propane conversion (C-atom basis) to propene would be about 17% at 773 K and about 31% at 823 K. (ii) Propane cracking is definitely thermodynamically preferred over aromatisation below 775 K. This reaction should be minimised as much as possible because it leads to irreversible carbon loss as CH4. In addition, the presence of CH, would also increase the difficulty of hydrogen recovery. Hence, the acidity of the catalyst will have to be carefully balanced with its dehydrogenating function. (iii) When all three reactions are allowed in the temperature range of 773 to 823 K, the major product is CH4 and the equilibrium selectivities (C-atom basis) to Cl-CZ hydrocarbons and CgHs are 54 and 46%, respectively. (iv) When cracking is assumed to be negligible (in non-equilibrium conditions, it corresponds to the presence of a catalyst favouring strongly aromatisation and dehydrogenation over cracking), H2 becomes the dominant reaction product. Excluding hydrogen, the C6Hg selectivity (C-atom basis) is then 88.6% at 773 K, and 97% at 823 K. A number of conclusions can be drawn from the thermodynamic data. Firstly, the statement sometimes made in the literature that the low yield of propene in propane conversion is due to the slowness of the propane dehydrogenation step when compared to cracking, must be corrected. Thermodynamics indeed show that dehydrogenation is not the favoured reaction. As the temperature dependencies of cracking and dehydrogenation equilibria are rather parallel (see Fig. 2 ), the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio should not be affected much by temperature, which is indeed the case. Secondly, thermodynamic calculations indicate, in addition to all other mechanistic and kinetic considerations, that higher selectivity in CH4 and lower selectivity to C6Hg are interrelated and inevitably linked to reaction pathways that allow cracking. Consequently, excess acid activity that enhances cracking will reduce aromatic selectivity, as indeed observed in the conversion of light naphtha for which acid activity is not required. Understanding the interplay between the acidic and dehydrogenating functions hence becomes the central problem in the optimisation of bifunctional catalysts for the aromatisation of LPG. Thirdly, the CH4/C6Hs ratio may be used to evaluate the relative contributions of cracking and aromatisation pathways to the conversion of propane. The equilibrium ratio is about 1.2 in the temperature range of 773 to 823 K, when all reactions are allowed to occur simultaneously. This ratio is in excellent agreement with values of 1.25 recently published for H-MFI [ 5 ] . Finally, when batch experiments, e.g., the in situ 13C MAS NMR mea- E.G. DeroOne et aL / J. Mod. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 379 surements reported here, are performed, CH4 is the end and a major reaction product. This behaviour will be more pronounced if the reaction temperature is not high enough to allow aromatisation reaction to occur. This will be proven by our experimental results. 3.3.13C MAS NMR of propane activation 3.3.1. Identification of the reaction intermediates and products Figures 3.a and 3.b show the in situ 13C MAS NMR spectra observed after reaction of propane 2-13C on catalysts 2356 SLl and 2234 SL2, at 723 K after 5 min and 573 K for 640 min, respectively. Both spectra show a set of resonances in the chemical shift range of -10 to 50 ppm corresponding to aliphatic carbons (CH, CHz, CH3) . Olefinic and aromatic carbon lines, with chemical shifts in the range 80--160 ppm, were usually not observed (except at 723 K and low initial propane loading [37] ), possibly because their lines are broadened to beyond the detection limit and due to limitations imposed by their relaxation times.

Table 3 lists the observed resonances, their assignments, and the corresponding predicted chemical shifts (referred to TMS) in solution. The proposed line assignments are further discussed below. The assignment of the methyl group lines corresponding to ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane, and i-pentane is straightforward. The chemical shifts are nearly identical to those reported in solution as seen in Table 3. The resonances at about 36 and 46 ppm are the spinning sidebands from the most intense resonances at about 6 and 16 ppm which correspond to the carbon atoms of ethane and propane, respectively. The lines at about - 7 and -11 ppm are characterised by a number of features: (i) The resonance at - 7 ppm always appears before the resonance at -11 ppm. (ii) 'H-13C cross-polarisation is observed for the -7 ppm line only. (iii) The ratio of both lines is affected by temperature as shown in Fig. 4. The - 7 ppm line is the only one observed below ambient temperature. The intensity of the -11 ppm line increases with temperature. (iv) In the absence of 1H decoupling, the resonance at 6.2 ppm is a quadruplet with relative intensities 1:3:3:1, corresponding to a methyl group (from ethane) (Fig. 5.b) .

These observations indicate that the lines observed at - 7 and -11 ppm stem from CH4 species. The CH4 component observed at - 7 ppm is more strongly sorbed than that at -11 ppm as shown by the cross-polarisation and variable temperature experiments. The resonances at about 17, 22, and 26 ppm are shifted from predicted values of either CHZ or CH groups. However, the 17 ppm line must correspond to the methene group of propane as it is the only one observed after adsorption of CH3 CHZCH3 at ambient temperature (the \"' indicates the position of 13C label). The 26 ppm and 13.5 ppm lines appear simultaneously. It is thus likely that the 26 ppm line stems from the methene group of n-butane. The same observation holds for the lines at 24.5 and 22 ppm. The 22 ppm resonance could then correspond to the CH group of i-butane. However, the latter signal might also arise from the Cl carbon of i-pentane as other resonances (11, 30, and 32 ppm) which could be attributed to the other carbon atoms of isopentane are also distinguished simultaneously in some spectra.

This problem is beat answered by comparing 13C MAS NMR spectra obtained with (a) and without (b) decoupling, such as those observed after 70% conversion at 573 K of propane 2-'3C on catalyst 2356 SLl (Figs. 5.a and 5.b ) .13C nuclei bound to an odd number of proton ( s ), i.e., CH or CH3 groups, appear as multiplets with an even number of lines ( 2 or 4 ), respectively. The lines in the split spectrum in Fig. 5.b are symmetrical with respect to the corresponding resonances in the unsplit spectrum in Fig. 5.a. This situation is observed for the CHa resonances identified hereabove and also for the resonance at 22 ppm. The latter splits as a doublet. It is confirmed to be the CH group of i-butane. Multiplets consisting of an odd number of lines characterise 13C nuclei bound to an even number of protons, i.e., CHz or CH4. In this case, the multiplet line with the highest intensity coincides in position E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 383 with the only line observed in the unaplit spectrum. Thus, the resonance at 26 ppm is indeed associated with the CH2 group of n-butane. Besides the shift to higher field observed for methane, it is thus observed that CH3 resonances are not shifted much with respect to data in solution. This is expected as the geometry and electron distribution of CH3 groups are not expected to be noticeably affeO by adsorption. The situation is however different for CHZ and CH groups. Indeed, upon adsorption, the C-CH. C angle (s) may vary as geometrical constraints are imposed on the sorbate (propane, n-butane, i-butane, ... ). Thus, the 13C resonance may be remarkably shifted as observed in the present work, when it is due to a CH2 or a CH group. In conclusion, a number of NMR lines corresponding to intermediates and products observed in the initial steps of the propane conversion have been unambiguously identified. Their assignments are given in Table 3. The quantification of the intensity variation of these lines as a function of several variables (temperature, concentration of acid sites and of various Ga species, ... ) will be the basis for the understanding of the mechanism explaining the activation and conversion of propane. 3.3.2. Complementary role Otween acidic and gOium-related sites for propane activation Figures 3.a and 3.b show nearly identical spectra, although they result from propane conversion at two different conditions; at 573 K for 640 min on 2234 SL2 and at 723 K for 5 min on 2356 SLI. The most obvious conclusion is thus that the reaction pathway is the same for both catalysts systems and is not altered by the operating conditions, i.e. (i) it does not change in the temperature range of 573-723 K (extended to below 793 K), and (ii) acid and dehydrogenating catalytic sites complement each other under the same reaction conditions. A mechanism previously claimed for the activation of propane is the protonation by a superacidic site to form the C3H9 carbonium ion possessing a pentacoordinated carbon, followed by its decomposition into C3H7 and Hz or CZHb and CH4 [ 12,23,24 ] . This type of carbocation explains the product distribution observed in the catalytic cracking of hesanes on H-MFI catalysts at temperatures higher than 723 K [ 12 ] . Thus, in accordance to this proposal, the activation of propane has two limitations. Firstly, there is the necessity to operate the reaction at \"high\" temperature, and the other is the need for the catalysts to possess superacidity [ 12 ] . However, these criteria need not be met when the conversion of propane is carried out at 573 K on (Ga/H) -MFI. Hence, there must be another reaction pathway in conjunction with other possible propane activation routes to explain the activation of propane, already occurring at 573 K and still prevailing at higher temperature. Interestingly, some recent reports indicate that propane can be activated, possibly by heterolytic dissociative adsorption, on non-framework or ion-exchanged Ga species [14,25]. 384 723 K, Smin 573 K, 160 min 573 K, 40 min 573 K, 10 min 573 K, 5 min 298 K, 0 min E.G.

Three in situ NMR experiments were performed to investigate the complementary synergy between gallium species and acidic sites in the early stage of (2-13C) propane activation. Figures 6 to 8 show spectra observed after conversion of propane (4 molecules/uc) at 573 K on Ga-MS76, Ga-MS40, and HMS40. Ga-MS76 (Si/Al=480, 0.95 wt.% Ga) has very low activity at 573 K (Fig. E.G.

After 5 min of reaction time at 723 K, some \"CH3CH2CH3 species (16 ppm ) are formed by scrambling of the 13C label, and the presence of other weak lines associated to the formation of n-butane (13.5 and 26 ppm), isobutane (24.5 E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 387 ppm ), ethane (6.2 ppm ), and methane (- 7 ppm, very weak) . In contrast, GaMS40 (Si/Al-35,1.02 wt.% Ga) displays a remarkable activity at 573 K (Fig. 7) . Scrambling of the 13C label in propane is immediately observed and is completed in about 20 min. After about 5-10 min of reaction time, n-butane and isobutane appear as products although ethane and methane are still not visible. Ethane and methane are only observed after about 10-20 and 20-40 min, respectively. These results prove unambiguously that Bronsted acidity (richer in Ga-MS40 than Ga-MS76) is necessary to activate propane at 573 K on Gacontaining H-MFI catalysts. In view of the similarity in the behaviour of Gaand Zn-containing MFI catalysts towards propane aromatisation, this observation is in line with a recent report indicating that propane dehydrogenation to propene is the only reaction observed on a Zn-silicalite catalyst [ 26 ] . Figure 8 shows that propane activation also occurs at 573 K on Ga-free HMS40. However, two major differences arise due to the absence of gallium as seen when comparing Figs. 7 and 8: Firstly, scrambling of the 13C label in propane is about 4 times slower on HMS40 relative to Ga-MS40. It is thus confirmed that there is a complementary synergy between the actions of Ga and acidic sites in the very first step leading to the activation of propane. Secondly, Ga-MS40, relative to H-MS40, shows a higher selectivity for the formation of n-butane. This may be due to the formation of Cl-species, e.g., CHI , by decomposition of a propane intermediate formed on catalytically active Ga species. Such carbenium ions could subsequently attack propene or propane at either the terminal or the central carbon atom, leading to n-butane or isobutane, respectively. Reaction could also occur with a pseudo-cyclopropane intermediate, generating a methyl-pseudo-cyclopropane carbenium ion which would lead to n-butane and i-butane in a 2:1 ratio. Formation of the CZHb carbenium ion and its subsequent reaction with CZH4 or CZHg may also lead to n-butane. The spectra observed after prolonged reaction time, greater than 40-80 min, at 573 K on H-MS40 and Ga-MS40 are almost identical, although there is a difference in the intensity of n-butane/isobutane ratio (Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, evidence of faster scrambling and higher concentration of n-butane observed in Ga-MS40 than H-MS40, lead us to conclude that gallium species play a vital role in the catalytic activity occurring during the initial steps of the propane activation. Scrambling of the 13C label in propane, in the absence of any large amount of other reaction products, can only occur via a cyclic intermediate. As both Ga sites and acidic sites have a complementary function to each other during this process, we propose the propane activation mechanism shown in Fig. 9. The active site responsible for the propane activation consists of an (Ga3+, 02-) ion pair closely associated with an acidic Bronated site. The acidic site is provided by the bridge OH of the zeolite, as a result of either A1 or Ga isomor- 388 H C3Hg + Ga+3 0-2 O GaD or Z Ga ionex E.G. Derouane et al. /J. Mol.

The (Ga3+, OZ-) ion pair involves either ion-exchanged gallium, Gao ea, and an oxygen anion from the zeolite lattice, or dispersed extra-framework Ga species, (GaD), which may contain oxygen if they are (hydroxy)-cations or neutral species, or may also need zeolite oxygen anions otherwise. It is proposed that propane interacts heterolytically with the (Gal 1, 02- ) ion pair via a positive and a negative charged hydrogen atom, and that it( is converted to a pseudo cyclopropane entity which can be protonated by a neighbouring Bronated site. The heterolytic activation/dissociation of propane as (C3H.; , H-) on an oxidic Ga-component was already claimed previously [14,26]. However, in these reports it was proposed that the activation of propane involves Ga sites only and the existence of a cyclic intermediate was not identified. The formation of the protonated pseudocyclopropane (PPCP) species is the key step for the initial 13C scrambling in propane. Upon chemisorption of propane, Ga3+ in the active site is formally reduced to Ga (I) and Ga is present as dispersed Ga hydride (Fig. 9) . This model provides an explanation for the recent Ga K-edge EXAFS data [ 27 ] claiming that active Ga species in Ga/H-MFI are highly dispersed, probably as Ga hydride coordinated to basic oxygens in the zeolite channels. Besides scrambling the carbon atoms of propane, by deprotonation recovering the Bronsted acid site and propane, the PPCP intermediate can evolve in at least four different ways, as illustrated in Fig. 10. (i) It can reorganize (by rupture along 1) to yield a C3H9 carbocation bound to the zeolite framework. We have discussed earlier that such carboca tions are unlikely to form by direct protonation of gas phase propane. We propose that PPCP provides an alternate route for the formation of such species which may play a role in the aromatisation of propane, similar to the proposal of Kitigawa et al. [ 28 ] . (ii) A C3H.; carbenium ion bound to the zeolite framework and dihydrogen are obtained if rupture occurs along 1 and 2. The C3H~ carbenium ion may further decompose into propene and in the event, restore the original zeolite Bronated acid site. This pathway is in line with the carbenium ion mechanism proposal by Mole et al. [ 29 ] , although the role of Ga was not E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol.

It also shows that molecular hydrogen release will occur from Ga (I) sites in agreement with the recent disclosure on the role of Ga as hydrogen \"porthole\" [ 2,27 ] . (iii) A third route involves rupture along 1 and 3. Methane and a CZHS carbenium ion bound to the zeolite framework are formed. CZH5 may restore 390 E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 the Bronsted acid site if it decomposes to ethene. This mechanism pathway explains how methane, observed even at very low conversion, is a primary reaction product [ 28,57,5 ] . However, the way how methane is formed as discussed earlier, differs from the proposal of Kitigawa et al. [ 28 ] and Gnep et al. [ 15 ] whereas here we propose the participation of gallium in its formation. (iv) Finally, the PPCP intermediate can also decompose into ethane and a CH' carbocation bound to the zeolite framework if rupture occurs along 1 and 4. Ethane has always been believed to be a secondary product of the aromatisation reaction, formed by hydrogenation of ethene via hydrogen transfer reactions. In addition to this conventional mechanistic pathway for the formation of ethane, we propose a novel route for the formation of ethane, i.e., decomposition of the PPCP intermediate along 1 and 4. Hence, ethane is also a primary reaction product. CH' carbocations formed can react further with olefins and alkanes. For example, reaction of CHI (stabilised by a basic zeolite oxygen) with propane (activated on the Ga site) may yield n-butane or isobutane. These products are indeed observed in the initial reaction stages. The yield of n-butane relative to isobutane was found to be higher for Ga-containing catalysts (Figs. 7 and 8), probably because the CH' carbocation may attack (activated) propane on one terminal C atom to form n-butane. Our model further rationalises the conclusions of several recent reports contributing to the understanding of the role of gallium in the early stages of the propane conversion. Ga (III) is reduced formally to Ga (I) upon formation of the PPCP intermediate. In our model, the early stage of propane conversion involves Bronsted acid sites and active gallium species which are either ionexchanged or non-framework dispersed Ga. Ga (I)-H formed in this process (Fig. 9) resembles the monomeric hydride species identified by recent in situ Ga K-edge EXAFS measurements [ 27 ] . Ga (III) is restored by dihydrogen desorption from these sites which act as hydrogen \"porthole\". Reduction of Ga (III) to a lower oxidation state of Ga has also been evidenced by'1Ga MAS NMR [21 ] where the resonance is shifted to higher field by about 30-40 ppm. The PPCP intermediate model is also in line with the activation of propane by dissociative adsorption on Ga species [ 14,25,30 ] . It justifies well the negative kinetic order with respect to HZ pressure reported for the propane conversion on Ga/H-MFI catalysts containing non-framework Ga species [ 14 ] . The heterolytic dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen on (Ga 3+, 02-) ion pairs would indeed prevent the activation of propane as PPCP. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the activation of propane on Ga/H-MFI occurs via a bifunctional catalytic mechanism involving a Bronsted acidic site and a dehydrogenation function provided by an (Ga3+, 02-) ion pair. The formation of a PPCP intermediate explains the rapid scrambling of C-atoms in propane and various products distributions observed. The Ga site, acting as \"porthole\", is also responsible for the desorption of molecular hydrogen. E.G. Derouane et al. / J Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 391 3.3.3. Reaction steps, relative reaction rates and activation energies Figures 11 and 12 show the 13C MAS NMR spectra observed after reaction of propane 2-13C at 573 K on catalyst 2234 SL2 and at 723 K on 2356 SLl. The following sequence of NMR signals is observed in the chemical shift range of -20 to 60 ppm relative to TMS: (i) Scrambling of the 13C label in propane 2-13 C, evidenced by the emergence of the 16 ppm resonance. ( ii) Simultaneous formation of n-butane (13.6 and 26 ppm ), i-butane (24.5 ppm), and ethane (6.2 ppm) (see Table 3). (iii) Formation of ethane and methane (lines at - 7 and -10.5 ppm) at the expense of residual propane, for longer reaction times. (iv) Eventually, conversion of ethane to methane. It is observed that higher acidity increases all reaction rates. 13C carbon balances indicate that up to 30% of the 13C labels may end up in aromatic and carbonaceous products which are also evidenced by broad resonances in the 120-150 ppm range. The conversion of propane to ethane and methane, and of ethane to methane, will be dealt with elsewhere [ 31 ] . Table 4 gives the variation of the NMR line intensities of propane, ethane, butane, and methane as a function of contact times at various temperatures. All intensities are normalised, 100% corresponding to the intensity of the starting resonance for propane 2-13C. From these values, assuming first order kinetics, apparent rate constants have been derived for the total conversion of propane, the scrambling of 13C in propane 2-13C, and the formation of butanes. Their values are listed in Table 5 together with the apparent activation energies derived from Arrhenius plots (Fig.13 ). The activation energies for the total conversion of propane are 24.5 and 28.6 kcal-mol-1 for catalysts 2234 SL2 and 2356 SL1, respectively. These values are in good agreement with our available kinetic data which report 22 kcal mol-1 for catalyst 2234 SL2 and the values reported in the literature of 19.5-20.8 kcal mol-1 for a Ga-exchanged H-MFI catalyst [32]. In addition, these values must also be compared to the activation energy reported for both cracking and dehydrogenation of propane, i.e., 34 kcal-mol-1, on Ga-free HMFI or H-mordenite catalysts [ 33 ] . The lower activation energy observed on Ga-containing catalysts militates in favour of the role of Ga, as demonstrated with the formation of the PPCP intermediate. The higher activity of 2234 SL2 compared to 2356 SLl, by a factor of 8.7 at 573 K and by 4.0 at 723-729 K, cannot be attributed only to a change in the concentration of acid sites. Indeed, the number of Bronsted sites in 2234 SL2 relative to 2356 SL1 is only higher by a factor equal to 2.6. Considering that gallium plays a role in the activation of propane to form PPCP and that the concentration of dispersed gallium (Ga;o.) in 2234 SL2 is 3.7 times larger than in 2356 SLl, the maximum activity increase to be expected on a purely statistical basis is (2.6 X 3.7) 9.6 times if the active site involves one Bronated and one dispersed gallium site per propane molecule. This value agrees well with our observation. 392 E.G. Derouane et al. / J.

Arrhenius plots for the total propane conversion (PC ), the scrambling of the 13C label in propane (S13C ), and the formation of butane (FB ) on 2234 SL2 and 2356 SLl catalysts. The activation energies for the scrambling of the 13C label in propane and the formation of butanes are 28.2 and 30.9 kcal-mol-1, respectively. These activation energies are close to that observed for the overall reaction, which could be explained by the formation of a common intermediate in the initial step. The formation and evolution of the proposed intermediate, PPCP, are described in Figa. 9 and 10. It involves both Bronsted acid sites and dispersed Ga species. 396 E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 3.3.4. Mechanism: proposal The first step in the activation of propane on Ga/H-MFI catalysts was reported, so far, to involve only monofunctional catalysis. Indeed, it was described to be either acid-catalysed (formation of a C3 carbenium or carbonium ion) or Ga-catalysed (dehydrogenation to propene). We have demonstrated that the initial activation of propane on Ga/HMFI catalysts was bifunctional. The bifunctional reaction step for the activation of propane (BREST) leads to the formation of a PPCP intermediate (Figs. 9, 10 and 14.A) which can further decompose to H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C3H6 as primary products or intermediates as shown in Fig. 14.A. The CH3 carboniO ion or the C3H' and C2Hg carbenium ions (RH+ ), stabilised on basic anionic ogygens of the zeolite framework, can further react as illustrated in Fig. 14.B.

(B) BREST for the reaction between CHs and carbeniO ions with olefins and alkanea. E.G. Derouane et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 397 ion pair (Ga3+, 02-) as illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10, yields a higher alkane R' RH2 or an olefin R' R (accompanied by the release of dihydrogen) . If RH+ is CH3 (note that CH3 is the protonated form of the carbene :CH2) and R' H2 is propane, the reaction product is either n-butane or isobutane. As no CH4 is detected in the early reaction stage when butanes and ethane begin to be formed, it is tempting to explain the formation of butanes observed only by the above mechanism which also justifies the higher yield of n-butane in the presence of gallium. However, it should be kept in mind that butanes can also be formed by reaction between C2Hg and C2He or C2H4 (accompanied by hydrogen transfer) or by cracking of Cb+ carbenium ions. Finally, it is to be noted that the absence of methane in the products when the scrambling of the 13C label in propane 2-13C has not occurred to a reasonable extent, is expected as the terminal methyl groups of propane 2-13C are non-labelled. Figure 14.B schematises a new pathway for the activation of light alkanes, including propane, butane, and possibly ethane. Cracking of the latter is indeed also observed (Figs.11 and 12). This pathway requires the conjunct action of both Ga and acidic catalytic sites. In contrast, the parallel and conventional reaction of carbenium ions such as C2H6 or C3H7 , most probably present at the surface as alkoside species at ambient temperature [34], with olefins, depends only on the availability of Bronsted acidic sites. The precise contribution of the novel propane activation route to the overall aromatisation reaction is difficult to evaluate at this moment, although it certainly affects the products yield as evidenced by the variation of the i-butane/n-butane ratio. Our view on the overall reaction mechanism for the aromatisation of propane is schematised in Fig. 15, taking into account pre-existing information [35] and our results described hereabove. In the first step of propane activation, the upper reaction network in the figure shows the conventional mechanism where propane can be transformed into propene via a C3H7 carbenium Ga+3 H+ C3H8 H+ H2 -~-D C3H~ H+ _ C4, CS H+ _ C6, Ca Ga+_ 3Diolefins Ga+3 Triolefins CZH4 aliphatics aliphatics H2 H+ HZ Ga+3 H+ Ga+3, ~k CH4i H+ 1 ~~H_6 ~qrCH3+ .

Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 371-400 ion on gallium sites. This route further implies a pool of intermediate C2-C8 olefins. It is assumed that the C2-C6 olefins can further react, as similarly proposed for the conversion of methanol to gasoline, by conjunct polymerisation to yield higher olefins (dimers, trimers) [ 36 ]. The carbenium ions CH3, C2H5+ and C3H' which are formed by decomposition of the PPCP intermediate can react further with alkanes and olefins as discussed above (lower part of Fig. 15). The (Gal+, 02-) ion pair act as \"porthole\" for the release of molecular dihydrogen. The Ce-C8 aliphatics formed can undergo dehydrogenation on gallium sites to form diolefins and/or can undergo cyclisation on protonic sites to form naphthenes. These two intermediates can then easily form aromatics through further dehydrogenation on gallium sites. 4. Conclusions (11) Four novel major conclusions can be drawn: Firstly, the activation of propane occurs on bifunctional catalytic sites consisting of an (Gal+, 02-)ion pair and a Bronsted acidic site. The Gacontaining species are in ion-exchanged or in dispersed extraframework positions. The NMR experiments with labelled propane conclude to the existence of a pseudo-protonated cyclopropane species (PPCP) intermediate which can decompose in various ways to yield CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3Hg, and H2 as primary products. Note however that the very same molecules can also be produced by conventional dehydrogenation (on gallium sites), cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions (on acid sites) at high conversion. Methyl carbonium ions, formed by decomposition of PPCP with ethane besides other products, may react further with olefins or alkanes (if the latter species are activated on the Ga site). The first reaction is conventional, the second one is novel. It corresponds to a new reaction pathway for the activation of propane into the aromatisation cycle/process. (iii) C2 and C3 carbenium ions may be formed by evolution of the PPCP intermediate. It is believed that these carbenium ions can further react with C2 and C3 olefins or alkanes activated on the Ga sites to yield higher aliphatic compounds which will eventually dehydrocyclise. (iv) The function of gallium as \"porthole\" for the release of dihydrogen is probably associated in some way to its catalytic action in the activation of propane to form the PPCP intermediate.

Propane 2-13C was used as labelled reactant. The scrambling of the 13C label in the very early stages of the propane conversion, even at 573 K, indicates that the first reaction intermediate is a protonated pseudocyclopropane (PPCP) species formed by activation of propane on a (Ga3+,O2−) ion pair and its protonation by a nearby Brønsted acidic site. This PPCP species can decompose in several ways leading to H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6 as primary products. The very same molecules can also be produced as secondary products by cracking and hydrogen transfer at high conversion. CH+ 3 , C2H+ 5 and C3H+ 7 carbenium ions which are formed by decomposition of PPCP can react further with alkane or olefinic species. Reaction of CH+ 3 (stabilised by a basic anionic framework oxygen) with propane (activated on a Ga site) may yield n-butane as indicated by the increase in the n-butane/i-butane ratio when the catalyst contains gallium.
