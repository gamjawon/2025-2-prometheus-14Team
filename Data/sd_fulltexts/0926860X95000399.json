Kharkara Chemical Engineering Division, Department of Chemical Technology, University of Bombay, Matunga Bombay-400 O l 9, India Received 29 June 1994; revised 23 November 1994; accepted 30 January 1995 Abstract Liquid-phase hydrogenation of a series of nitriles, namely, benzonitrile, butyronitrile, cinnamoni- trile and crotononitrile over Cu-Ni/SiO2 and Fe-Ni/SiO2 has been investigated and the activities of the catalysts have been correlated with the structure of the catalysts on the basis of frontier orbital energy levels. Keywords: Hydrogenation; Nickel-copper/silica; Nickel-iron/silica; Nitriles 1. Introduction Addition of another metal to the parent metal has been found to have an inter- esting effect upon the activity and selectivity of the parent metal for various vapour phase reactions [ 1]. This effect has not been fully exploited for liquid-phase hydrogenations which are of great relevance in organic synthesis. Some studies do exist [2-4] for single model compounds, which do not give a true picture of the behaviour of the functional group as a whole, especially the effect of substituents. So in the present study a series of nitriles, namely, benzonitrile, butyronitrile, cinnamonitrile and crotononitrile were hydrogenated on silica supported copper- nickel and iron-nickel systems of different compositions. The activity results obtained have been correlated with the structure of the catalysts determined from * Corresponding author. Fax. (+91-22) 4145614. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Attempts have been made to explain the activity changes obtained for various nitriles on various catalysts on the basis of frontier orbital energy levels calculated by quantum chemical MNDO method for various molecules. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Different compositions of silica (Aerosol-200, Degussa) supported Ni-Cu and Ni-Fe (range 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100) were prepared by co-impregnating silica with the respective nitrates in appropriate proportions on weight basis by the incipient wetness technique. The total metal loading was kept at 20% by mass. The nitrates were decomposed to their corresponding oxides by heating in a flow of air at 723 K for 4 h and reduced in a flow of H2 at 723 K prior to their use. 2.2. Characterization of catalysts The reduced catalysts were passivated in order to prevent total oxidation leading to sintering, when exposed for analysis (as some instruments do not have in situ reduction facilities). It was ensured that the procedure followed for passivation gave only a surface layer of oxide. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the reduced and passivated catalysts were recorded on a Rigaku diffractometer. Ni and Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) were recorded in a specially designed cell in situ by using a Rigaku Mo-anode rotating diffractometer. Mossbauer spectra were recorded in situ in the same cell, by using a 57Co source. The details of the characterization technique and data analysis procedures will be published elsewhere [5]. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the above mentioned catalysts was performed by using a Stanton-Red- croft programmable furnace and the response was measured by using a thermal conductivity detector connected to a recorder. Hydrogen chemisorption measure- ments were done by using the conventional high vacuum static method. 2.3. ActiviO' studies The hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 100 ml Hastealloy B2 Parr autoclave, equipped with a four-bladed magnetically driven impeller, under kinet- ically controlled conditions. For benzonitrile and butyronitrile, the substrate con- centration was 30% w/w in methanol, and for crotononitrile and cinnamonitrile, it was 10% w/w in methanol. Catalyst loading in all the cases was maintained at 1% w/w of substrate. The products were analysed by gas-liquid chromatography (Per- kin Elmer 8300) by using FID. G.D. Yadav, M.R.

Results and discussions 3.1. Characterisation The metal content of the impregnated catalysts was checked by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The respective metal contents of the bimetallic catalysts were found to be in the expected range of compositions with a deviation of _+ 2%. The XRD pattern of Ni-Cu (75:25)/SiO2 showed a single phase face centered cubic (FCC) alloy, whereas Ni-Cu (50:50 and 25:75)/SIO2 showed formation of a biphasic alloy. The crystallite sizes determined by using Schrerrer's equation are given in Table 1. The crystallite sizes of all the catalysts are fairly large. For Ni- Fe catalysts at all the compositions the Mossbauer spectra showed the presence of a Ni-Fe super paramagnetic alloy. Additionally, the 75:25 and 50:50 compositions showed a small ferromagnetic alloy component with a small amount of Fe2 +. The 25:75 composition showed non-alloyed Fe and some Fe2 +. Fe3 + was not observed in any compositions used in this study. The radial structure functions (RSF) of the Ni and Fe K-edge EXAFS of the Ni-Fe catalysts showed some interesting features. The RSF of Ni-Fe (75:25) is similar to that of pure Ni having FCC structure, whereas both Ni-Fe (50:50) and Ni-Fe (25:75) showed the presence of mixed phases (FCC+body centered cubic (BCC)). Similar observations have been reported by Rao et al. [6] for Ni-Fe catalysts prepared by the precipitation tech- nique. The summary of the structural parameters determined by fitting the EXAFS data is given in Table 2. The high values for the co-ordination number, the same as those that are found in unsupported metals, indicate the presence of large crystallites supporting the earlier XRD data. 118 G.D. Yadav, M.R.

The TPR studies of the Ni-Cu system show that the addition of Cu enhances the reducibility of Ni, as reported by Robertson et al. [ 7 ]. Similarly in the case of the Ni-Fe system, the reducibility of Fe is enhanced by the addition of Ni. 3.2. Actiyity The results of benzonitrile and butyronitrile hydrogenation are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The activities are compared on the basis of unit mass of the catalyst. The main feature of these plots is the improved activity of the Ni-Fe (75:25)/SIO2 catalyst as compared to Ni/SiO2, whereas on addition of Cu to Ni the activity gradually drops. Table 3 presents the results of cinnamonitrile and crotononitrile hydrogenations. In the case of cinnamonitrile an increase in activity was also observed at the ( 75:25 ) Ni-Fe composition.

This observation is consistent with another part of this study for cyclohexene hydrogenation [5], wherein enhancement on Ni-Fe (15:25) was not observed. In all four reactions, no major changes in selectivity took place with change in catalyst compositions. The reproducibility of the results was checked by repeating the runs at least three times on the same batch of catalyst and for another three times for a different batch of catalyst and was found to be within acceptable limits ( _+ 5% for the same batch of the catalyst and _+ 10% for different batches of the catalyst). 3.3. Selectivity The nitrile hydrogenations proceed according to the scheme described by Rylan- der [8] and the major final product is the primary amine with some secondary Table 3 Hydrogenation of cinnamonitrile and crotononitrile Catalyst Activity 105 (mol s 1 gcatl) Cinnamonitrile 20% Ni/SiO2 3.65 20% Ni-Cu (75:25)/SiO2 4.30 20% Ni-Fe (75:25)/SiO2 5.48 Crotononitrile 20% Ni/SiO2 13.65 20% Ni~u ( 75:25 )/SiO2 11.83 20% Ni-Fe (75:25)/SiO2 9.41 Reaction conditions: temp.= 150; H2 pressure= 34 atm., catalyst loading: 1% w/w; substrate concentra- tion- 10% w/w in methanol. 120 G.D.

For the unsaturated nitriles, the products were saturated amines and nitriles. No unsaturated amine was observed for any of the catalyst compositions. The decrease in the activity of Ni-Cu catalyst is much smaller (see Table 4) than that observed for CO hydrogenation [9], where the drop in activity caused by alloying of Ni with Cu was explained by the geometric or ensemble effect [ 1,9]. As can be seen from Table 4, the activity per site, of pure Ni and Ni-Cu (75:25), is comparable. Obviously, this hydrogenation of benzonitrile does not require ensembles of Ni, as many other hydrogenations do [ 1 ], whereas for Ni-Fe (75:25), the activity is found to increase by a factor of 1.6. Earlier studies on Pt-Fe, Rh-Fe, and Pd-Fe catalysts for CO hydrogenation have reported similar improvements in activity [ 10]. The improved activity of Ni-Fe catalysts has been attributed to the formation of either (i) M-Fe3+ sites in which CO binds by the oxygen end to Fe3+ or (ii) M- Fealloyed sites, in which case there is a charge transfer from Fe to the metal M. Such a charge transfer produces what is commonly called an electronic or ligand effect. In the present study no evidence of Fe3 + is found by Mossbauer spectros- copy. Another explanation may perhaps be given that the electron transfer in alloys is generally negligible and that Fe has a promoting effect on Ni, in the case of hydrogenation of nitriles. The promoting effect may be due to one of the following possibilities: (i) Pure Fe has a much lower activity than pure Ni, hence, the higher activity of Ni-Fe (75:25), which has a single phase FCC structure, can be attributed to the Ni-Fesites because it gets covered by reaction byproducts. However, an isolated Fe atom in the Ni lattice is more active site than a Ni atom. (ii) An Fe atom is not a good site for catalysis, the site must be an Ni atom. However, a CN group 1r-complexed to Ni can be activated towards hydrogenation by Fe (or Fe2 +), the latter atom (or ion) attracting the electron from the orbital on nitrogen. It is therefore necessary to provide further credence to one of the above hypoth- eses. The work of Chouresia and Chopra [ 11 ] could be cited in this context. They have reported a charge transfer from Feto Ni for Ni-Fe (76:24) by using soft X- ,ay appearance potential spectroscopy and the improved activity of nitriles as a whole can be attributed to the electronic effect. Our results on acetophenone hydro- genation have also shown that for the Ni-Fe (75:25) composition the much larger enhancement in activity [4] is due to the same effect. The further drop in activity G.D. Yadav, M.R.

To understand how such a charge transfer from Fe to Ni might enhance the activity, knowledge of the nature of bonding between adsorbate and the transition metal is necessary. Considerable work on CO adsorption on transition metals has been done [ 12]. The primary interactions are the forward donation from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of CO, i.e., from 5o- to the surface dz2 and s states, and the back donation from the metal dxz,yz states to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CO i.e. 2rr*. The HOMO 5o- which is a bonding orbital is mainly a carbon lone pair. The LUMO 27r* consists of two antibonding orbitals with large coefficients at the carbon atom. Increased back donation strength- ens the metal--carbon bond and favours C=O bond dissociation. An excellent treatment of C-N chemisorption has been given by Albert et al. [ 13 ]. who have shown that the C--N is also perturbed similar to C--O, by an increase in back donation from metal to the adsorbate. Thus, from a hydrogenation point of view, an increase in electron density of Ni due to charge transfer from Fe, should lead to increased back bonding, thereby weakening the carbon-nitrogen bond, which in turn should favour hydrogenation. An interesting fact which emerges in this study is that the four nitrile compounds are perturbed to varying extents by the addition of Fe. Some idea about the reasons for different levels of perturbation is obtained from the molecular orbital details of these molecules. Accordingly the MNDO (minimum neglect of differential orbital overlap) energy optimization programme was run on a Micro-Vax computer for each molecule after feeding the respective co-ordinates. In Table 5 the pertinent details obtained from the output are compiled for the four nitriles. From the above discussion it is clear that binding interaction will be favoured when the HOMO is at a higher energy level to favour forward donation and LUMO is at a lower energy level to favour back donation from the metal. 122 G.D. Yadav, M.R. Kharkara /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 126 (I 995) 115-123 Table 5 shows that: (1) The HOMO increases in the following order: cinnamonitrile > benzonitrile > crotononitrile > butyronitrile. (2) The LUMO decreases in the following order: benzonitrile < cinnamonitrile < crotononitrile < butyronitrile. (3) Thus with an increase in electron density on the metal surface, the order in which the molecules will be perturbed (or the metal carbon bond strength- ened) is: benzonitrile > cinnamonitrile > crotononitrile > butyronitrile. (4) The trend which is actually obtained on addition of Fe, is more or less in the similar order. The low activity for the hydrogenation of crotononitrile has already been explained. 4. Conclusions The activities and selectivities of the bimetallic Ni-Cu and Ni-Fe supported on silica for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of some saturated and unsaturated nitriles -- benzonitrile, cinnamonitrile, crotononitrile and butyronitrile -- have been inves- tigated and correlated vis-h-vis their structures. The quantum chemical MNDO calculations for each nitrile have been used to explain the observed activities of the catalysts. Acknowledgements M.R.
