THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEGREE OF PORE-FILLING ON THE PERFORMANCE H. L. PELT, N. A. DE MUNCK*, R. P. J. VERBURG, J. J. J. J. BROCKHUS** and J. J. F. SCHOLTEN+ Department of Chemical Technology, Delft University of Technology, Julianalaan 136, 2628 BL Delft (The Netherlands) (Received July 12, 1984; accepted November 26, 1984) Summary The catalytic hydroformylation of butene-1 and butene-2 (cis and trans) is compared with the hydroformylation of ethene and propene, using supported liquid phase rhodium catalysts (Rh SLP catalysts). Attention is paid to the reaction rates, the linear-to-branched alkanal ratios (1/b), and the catalyst stabilities found with the various alkenes. It is shown that the degree of pore-filling of SLP catalysts not only determines the catalytic activity per unit weight of rhodium, but the linear- to-branched alkanal ratio as well. This is due to the fact that the alkene conversion must be attributed to two classes of rhodium complexes, viz. rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface and those dissolved in the liquid phase. The relative contribution of these two classes of complexes to the catalytic performance changes as a function of the degree of pore-filling. In studying SLP catalysts with the macroreticular resin XAD-2 as a support, it appeared that on decreasing the degree of pore-filling, the linear- to-branched alkanal ratio decreased with a simultaneous increase in catalytic activity per unit weight of rhodium. Catalysts with a very low degree of pore-filling are attractive with respect to their high activity per rhodium complex. It is shown that the rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface exhibit a higher activity and a lower 1/b ratio than the complexes in solution. Butene-2, which exhibits an extremely low hydroformylation activity due to steric hindrance, could only be hydroformylated over Rh SLP catalysts having a very low degree of pore-filling (monolayer catalysts).

The influence of type of support on the performance of a SLP has been demonstrated by us in two previous articles [8, 9]. It was shown that many supports induce adsorptive complex withdrawal, which often gives rise to elimination of the complexes as catalytic centres. Hence, supports negatively influence the rhodium utilization in SLP catalysts, but an exception must be made for the styrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2), which exhibits almost no complex adsorption. Therefore this support is an excellent choice with respect to maximum rhodium utilization. In our previous work it was also pointed out that during hydroformyla- tion the alkanals produced dissolve into the solvent-ligand, and attain a steady state concentration which depends on experimental conditions such as temperature and feed composition [8,9]. The dissolved alkanal may influence the position of the equilibria between the various rhodium com- plexes in solution, and also the extent of rhodium complex adsorption. Therefore the amount of dissolved alkanal co-determines the catalytic per- formance. Furthermore, dissolution of the alkanal limits the maximum allowable alkene conversion, because too large a conversion to alkanal leads to soaking of the catalyst. Moreover, we concluded that the reaction takes place at the gas-liquid interface as well as in the bulk solution. In the present article, the performance of some rhodium SLP catalysts in the hydroformylation of butene-1 and butene-2 (cis and trans) is reported, and compared with the results of hydroformylation experiments with ethene and propene. It is generally known that internal alkenes such as butene-2 need fairly active catalysts. As explained above, XAD-2 is the best choice in such a case. Moreover, from exploratory research by de Munck [10], we know that XAD-2 as a support, combined with a very low degree of pore- filling, leads to catalysts with a very high activity per rhodium complex. Such catalysts were coined monolayer catalysts by us, and in connection with their high specific activity they were tested in the hydroformylation of butene-2. The fact that these catalysts give rise to low linear-to-branched alkanal ratios is no disadvantage in this case, since the introduction of the formyi group on carbon atom 2 or 3 in butene-2 leads to the same alkanal. Experimental Materials RhH(CO)(PPh3)3 was prepared by the method of Ahmad et al. [11]. Triphenylphosphine (Merck, F.R.G., 99%) was used as received. Benzene and toluene (Merck. F.R.G.. 99%) were dried over molecular sieve 3A. from 373 Union Carbide, U.S.A. Butene-1 (99.5%), cis- and frans-butene-2 (99%), nitrogen (99.9%) and hydrogen (99.99%) were obtained from Hoek Loos NV, The Netherlands. Carbon monoxide (99.5%), helium (99.98%), propene (99.5%) and ethene (99.9%) were obtained from Air Products, U.S.A. The gases were freed from traces of oxygen, water and carbon dioxide over BASF catalyst R3-11, molecular sieve 3A and sodium hydroxide on asbestos ('Ascarit') respectively. Hydrogen was freed from traces of oxygen and water over Pd-on-alumina catalyst (BASF, F.R.G.) and over molecular sieve 3A. The support material Silica-H is a non-commercial product from DSM, The Netherlands (SBET = 46 m2 g~1, Vp = 0.44 cn^g\"1, sodium content 10 ppm). The macroreticular resin Amberiite XAD-2, (Serva, F.R.G.) has a BET surface area of 300 m2 g~1 and a pore volume of 0.69 cm3 g~1. Catalyst preparation The rhodium SLP catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with a solution of RhH(CO)(PPh3)3 and of PPha in benzene to incipient wetness, followed by evaporation of the benzene. This method is described extensively by Gerritsen et al. [I], Some catalysts on XAD-2 (monolayer catalysts) were prepared by wet impregnation. Dry XAD-2 (10 g) was stirred with a solution containing the desired amount of the rhodium complex (0.10-0.35 g) and 3 mol PPh3 per mol rhodium in 80 cm3 toluene, saturated with hydrogen. The solution was slowly heated to 338 K during 1 h, and kept under hydrogen at 338 K for 2 h. The complex-loaded resin was then separated from the solution, and carefully washed three times with 100 cm3 toluene and twice with 100 cm3 diethyl ether in order to remove excess rhodium complex and triphenyl- phosphine. Additional triphenylphosphine was added to the surface by contacting the catalyst with a solution of PPh3 in diethyl ether for 0.5 h. Finally the catalyst was dried under hydrogen. Catalyst characterization The phosphorus content of the catalysts was determined by digestion of the samples, followed by colorimetric phosphorus titration. Digestion of the samples was carried out with a solution of sodium sulfate/mercury oxide in 95 - 98% sulfuric acid, at 743 K for 24 h. In a Technicon Autoanalyser, a blue colour is formed on addition of orthophosphate, molybdate and antimony ions, followed by reduction with ascorbic acid at pH = 7, see [12]. The phosphomolybdenum concentration was measured at X = 660 nm. The rhodium content of the catalysts was determined by neutron activation analysis, based on detection of the isotope ^Rh. The single comparator method was used, with Ti as a reference material [13]. The textures of supports and catalysts were determined by physical adsorption and capillary condensation of nitrogen at 77 K using a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic apparatus, type 1800. 374 Hydro formylation equipment The fixed bed continuous flow equipment and the method of experi- mentation is described in [ 1 ]. Gas chromatographic analysis of the product stream was performed in two apparatus. The first, self-constructed apparatus analysed the isomerisation and hydrogenation products of the alkene, and was equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a Hewlett Packard 5701A electrometer. The column used was filled with Spherosil XOB-75 (length 3 m, i.d. 0.0021 m). The selectivity for hydrogenation and isomerisation products was very low, and never exceeded 2% of the alkene conversion described in this paper. The second apparatus was a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph 5710A, with which the hydroformylation and the aldol condensation prod- ucts were analysed. Use was made of a column filled with 25% 0V 101 on Chromosorb WHP (length 4 m, i.d. 0.0021 m). Peak areas were integrated with a microprocessor LCI 11/03 from Digital Equipment Co., U.S.A. Results Comparison of the hydroformylation rates of ethene, propene and butene-1 over a Rh SLPC In the experiments reported in this paper, the reactor was operated differentially (conversion per pass <5%), and hence the reaction rate (r) can be expressed by: r=H/(W/F) (1) where W is the weight of rhodium in the reactor in grams, F is the alkene flow expressed in cm3 alkene per second (at 0.1 MPa, 293 K), ^ is the alkene conversion, and r is the reaction rate consequently expressed in cm3 alkene converted (at 0.1 MPa, 293 K) per gram rhodium per second. The reaction rates in Table 1 are the rates measured after a stable activity level was reached, which took less than 2 h. Stable activity is observed for at least 1000 h, and after this period there were no indications of deactivation. The SLPC was supported on Silica-H lumps, mean particle size 0.5 mm, with a degree ofpore-filling (6) of 0.5, and a P/Rh ratio of 100 mol phosphorus per mol rhodium. In the seventh column of Table 1, standardized reaction rates are presented, fixing the reaction rate with ethene at 100 arbitrary units. The standardized reaction rates were calculated at the same alkene concentration in PPha and at the same space velocity used in the ethene experiment. We took into account the facts that the reaction rate is first order in the alkene pressure and zero order in hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These orders were reported by Gerritsen et al. [3] and by Herman [5] for the case of propene, and were found in our own experiments for the case of butene-1. Furthermore, allowance is made for differences in alkene solubilities [14,15].

On lowering the carbon monoxide partial pressure, l/b strongly increases, whereas the hydrogen and butene-1 partial pressures hardly influence the l/b ratio. This is in agreement with the results found by Gerritsen et al. [3] in the hydroformylation of propene over a SLPC. The l/b ratios for the butene-1 hydroformylation, in compar- ison with propene hydroformylation, are on an average 60% higher over the entire range of carbon monoxide partial pressures investigated. In studying the effect of the degree of pore-filling (5) on the linear-to- branched ratio, a very interesting result was obtained. In order to avoid any influence of adsorptive complex withdrawal, XAD-2 was chosen as a support. The results are presented in Fig. 2, in which l/b, together with the butene-1 hydroformylation rate, is plotted as a function of 5. By way of comparison, the ethene hydroformylation reaction rate as a function of 5, published earlier by Gerritsen et al. [2], is reproduced in the same Figure. The course of curve (a) is explained in [9]: the lower the degree of pore- filling, the higher the percentage of rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface. These complexes are in direct contact with the gas-phase carbon monoxide, and therefore their mean coordination number with P, IMPd) Fig. 1.

By comparing curve (a) with curve (c), the ratio of the hydroformyla- tion rates of ethene and butene-1 can be calculated. We obtain the following results: at 6 = 0.1, the rate ratio is 7.3; at 8 = 0.2, the rate ratio is 11.3; at 5 = 0.5, the rate ratio is 29; at 8 = 0.8, the rate ratio is 43. Hence it appears that the lower the ratio of the rates of ethene and butene-1 hydrotormyla- tion, the lower the PPh3 coordination around the rhodium centre. Curve (b) in Fig. 2 represents the change in the linear-to-branched ratio in butene-1 hydroformylation, as influenced by 5. The higher the percentage of interface complexes (lower 5), the lower the 1/b ratio. This is in agreement with our previous conclusion that the gas-liquid interface complexes have a lower average PPh3 coordination. Catalytic behaviour of monolayer catalysts In the foregoing section the high activity per rhodium complex of SLP catalysts with very low degrees of pore-filling was demonstrated. Lowering the degree of pore-filling leads to catalysts covered with a monolayer of PPh3, in which the complexes are dissolved, or even to sub-monolayer cata- lysts. In this article, all these catalysts are termed 'monolayer catalysts'. A number of such catalysts were prepared and tested in the hydroformylation of propene, butene-1 and cis- and trans-butene-2. The rate of propene hydroformylation as a function of time, for a series of XAD-2-supported monolayer catalysts with various coverages, is shown in Fig. 3. Experimental conditions are indicated in the legend to Fig. 3, and the characteristic catalyst parameters are given in Table 2. These catalysts were Fig. 3.

The coverage with PPh3, containing dissolved complexes, is defined as: mol P (g support)-1 A^AV S(PPh3) (/-p, 1^1 pphi S(BET) where S(PPh3) is the cross-sectional area of a PPh3 molecule (1.2 X 10~18 m2), NAV is Avogadro's number (6.02 X 1023 molecules mol~1), and S(BET) is the BET surface area of the support (300 m2 g~1). Using XAD-2 as a support, a degree of pore-filling of 0.15 corresponds with monolayer coverage. By comparison, catalyst k shows the activity of a SLPC with 5 = 0.66. It is seen from the Figure that the catalytic activity of monolayer catalysts^ per unit weight of rhodium, is appreciably higher than found for SLP cata- lysts with a higher degree of pore-filling. In the case of catalyst a (6 is a 0.112 only), the activity is even a factor of 23 higher than that of k (0 is 4.4) (Fig. 3). The explanation for this effect is the same as that presented above for the behaviour of SLP catalysts. Just as found for this last type of cata- lyst, an increase in the activity is accompanied by a decrease in the linear-to- branched ratio (Fig. 4). Monolayer catalysts are stable only at reaction temperatures below 373 K. At higher degrees of pore-filling, the catalyst remains stable up to at least 393 K. Hydroformylation of butene-1 and butene-2, and mixtures thereof Alkenes with the double bond in the /3-position, like butene-2, react more slowly than alkenes with the double bond in the a-position, like butene-1. Alkenes with the general formula R,iR,2C=CH2 react even more slowly. In studying the hydroformylation of a number of unsaturated sub- strates, Brown and Wilkinson [16] observed an activity difference of a factor 379 0.02 0.0'. 0.06 008 0.10 Fig. 4.

We investigated to what extent our catalytic system shows the same trend. In Fig. 5 the rate of butene hydrofonnylation per unit weight of rhodium is plotted as a function of the percentage of butene-1 in the butene feed. The type of catalyst used and the experimental conditions are indi- cated in the legend of the Figure. In some cases part of the butene-1 was replaced by helium, in others by cis-butene-2. From the Figure it is shown that dilution of butene-1 by butene-2 has an effect on the reaction rate similar to that of dilution by helium, in accordance with the fact that the rate of reaction is 30 times lower for butene-2 compared to butene-1. It is also shown in Fig. 5 that the linear-to-branched ratio (1/b) is perfectly con- stant, independent of the percentage of butene-1. Hence in the hydrofor- mylation of a mixture of butene-1 and butene-2, butene-2 behaves practical- ly as an inert gas. During hydrofonnylation, butene-1 is separated from a mixture of butenes. Butene-2 can be hydroformylated, provided extremely active catalysts are used. Such catalysts are the monolayer catalysts described above. In Table 3 the results of the hydrofonnylation experiments are given. Under identical experimental conditions, the butene-1 conversion per unit weight of rhodium is six times higher over the monolayer catalyst than over the rhodium SLPC, and the 1/b ratio is lower, as explained earlier. Over the monolayer catalyst, both cis- and trans-butene-2 can be hydroformylated with measurable rates, which are about 30 times slower than that found for butene-1. Using the monolayer catalyst we observe a behaviour in the 380 TABLE 3 The rate of hydroformylation of butene-1, ci's-butene-2 and ftwis-butene-2 using a rhodium monolayer catalyst (catalyst B); for comparison, the rate of hydroformylation of butene-1 over a Rh SLPC is added (catalyst A) Type of alkene Catalyst Rate of hydroformylation Linear-to- to linear/branched alkanal branched ratio (cMbutene3 8Rh S~1) butene-1 Rh-SLPC (A) 17.3 butene-1 monolayer 86.0 catalyst (B^ cts-butene-2 monolayer c catalyst (B)11 (rons-butene-2 monolayer c catalyst (B)1' 1.0 17.3 23.0 3.7 3.3 c 3.6 c Experimental conditions: T = 363 K, P-[ = 1.2 MPa, H2:CO:butene = 1:1:1. \"This catalyst is described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Obviously the degree of PPh3 coordination in both types of catalysts is the same. SLP catalysts, on the other hand, show a behaviour corresponding with a higher degree of PPh3 coordination. It is noteworthy that the difference in hydroformylation rates between cis- and frans-butene-2 is very small. Obviously the difference in steric hindrance during formation of the Tr-bonded complex is small. During hydroformylation of butene-2, no isomerisation to butene-1 was observed, and hence no n-pentanal was observed in the product gas. Discussion The results summarized in Table 1 are typical of SLP catalysts with a relatively high degree of pore-filling. In such catalysts the ratio of the num- ber of active rhodium complexes in solution to the number of active rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface is very high, and therefore their catalytic behaviour is mainly governed by the complexes in the bulk of the liquid. This liquid is characterized by a high triphenylphosphine concen- tration, whereas the carbon monoxide concentration is very low [14]. It is very likely that the rhodium centre is provided with at least two triphenyl- phosphine ligands, and this finds expression in a high 1/b ratio (see the last column in Table 1). In the homologous series of alkenes, an activity decline by a factor of about 50 is found, proceeding from ethene to propene (seventh column of Table 1), but the activity found with butene-1 as a substrate does not deviate significantly from that of propene. Experiments with gaseous octene-1 in the feed (not reported here) showed that the activity of this higher alkene with i81 the double bond in the a-position did not deviate substantially from that of propene. However, higher alkenes gave rise to higher 1/b ratios. In the hydroformylation mechanism, the choice between the formation of a linear or a branched alkyi ligand is made during the interiigand reaction between the w-bonded alkene and the hydrogen ligand. It is likely that, for steric reasons, the formation of a linear alkyi ligand is increasingly favoured the longer the alkyi chain in the reacting alkene. By comparison with more highly diluted solutions of the Wilkinson complex, the activity of the rhodium complexes in our SLP catalysts is rela- tively low, in particular the activity to give the branched product. This is probably why the activity for the hydroformylation of cis- and trons-butene- 2 is virtually zero (see last two rows of Table 1). The most important observation reported in this paper is that the hydroformylation activity of SLP catalysts, calculated per rhodium complex, increases considerably with decreasing degree of pore-filling. This effect is accompanied by a decrease in the linear-to-branched ratio (see Fig. 2). The explanation is as follows. On decreasing the degree of pore-filling, the surface area of the gas-liquid interface greatly increases (see, for instance, Fig. 9 in [9]). Hence the percentage of complexes at the gas-liquid interface markedly increases, and these complexes have a lower average number of triphenylphosphine ligands around the rhodium centre. This follows from the observation that the 1/b ratio is much lower than that found for rhodium complexes in the bulk of the solvent-ligand. The lower average coordination with triphenylphosphine ligands at the gas-liquid interface we attribute to the direct contact these complexes have with the gas-phase carbon monoxide molecules. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the gas-phase (at 0.4 MPa partial carbon monoxide pressure, 1.2 MPa total pressure, and at 363 K) is a factor of about 15 higher than the concentration of carbon monoxide dissolved in the solvent-ligand triphenyl- phosphine. This follows from the solubility of CO in PPh3 experimentally determined by Herman et al. [14], and it means that the PPh3 ligand replace- ment by CO ligands is higher at the gas-liquid interface than in the bulk of the solvent-ligand. A secondary factor may be that the coordination of the rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface with free non-liganded PPh3 molecules is half the value in the bulk liquid, which means the thermo- dynamic activity of PPh3 is lower. The advantages of catalysts with a high gas-liquid interface-to-bulk liquid ratio manifest themselves most clearly in catalysts with a degree of pore-filling so low that a monolayer, or less than a monolayer, of PPh3, in which the rhodium complexes are dissolved, is present. From Table 3 we calculate that cis- or frans-butene-2 reacts more slowly by a factor of about 30 than butene-1 over these monolayer catalysts. This factor is about equal to that found by Brown and Wilkinson [16]. In comparing the reaction rates of pentene-1 and pentene-2 (CES and trans) and heptene-1 and heptene-2 (cis and trans), these investigators arrived at a factor of 25 and 30 respectively. Just as in our experiments with ct's- and frans-butene-2. Brown and Wilkinson 382 [16] did not find a significant difference between the rates with cis- or trans- heptene-2 as a substrate. Obviously the catalytic performance of the com- plexes at the gas-liquid interface in our catalysts is comparable with that of the complexes used by Wilkinson in his experiments with homogeneous dilute systems. Contrary to what was found with SLP catalysts with a high degree of pore-filling, monolayer catalysts are able to hydroformylate alkenes with the double bond in the (3-position, such as butene-2 (see Table 3). The activity found for butene-2 (cis and trans) is a factor of about 30 lower than that for butene-1. This may be due both to steric hindrance and to the electron- donating strength of the two CH3 groups in butene-2. Acknowledgements We thank Mr. P.

The catalytic hydroformylation of butene-1 and butene-2 (cis and trans) is compared with the hydroformylation of ethene and propene, using supported liquid phase rhodium catalysts (Rh-SLP catalysts). Attention is paid to the reaction rates, the linear-to-branched alkanal ratios (1/b), and the catalyst stabilities found with the various alkenes. It is shown that the degree of pore-filling of SLP catalysts not only determines the catalytic activity per unit weight of rhodium, but the linear-to-branched alkanal ratio as well. This is due to the fact that the alkene conversion must be attributed to two classes of rhodium complexes, viz rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface and those dissolved in the liquid phase. The relative contribution of these two classes of complexes to the catalytic performance changes as a function of the degree of pore-filling. In studying SLP catalysts with the macroreticular resin XAD-2 as a support, it appeared that on decreasing the degree of pore-fuling, the linear-to-branched alkanal ratio decreased with a simultaneous increase in catalytic activity per unit weight of rhodium. Catalysts with a very low degree of pore-filling are attractive with respect to their high activity per rhodium complex. It is shown that the rhodium complexes at the gas-liquid interface exhibit a higher activity and a lower 1/b ratio than the complexes in solution. Butene-2, which exhibits an extremely low hydroformylation activity due to steric hindrance, could only be hydroformylated over Rh-SLP catalysts having a very low degree of pore-filling (monolayer catalysts).
