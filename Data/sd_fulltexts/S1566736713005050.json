Tel./fax: +86 25 58731090. Uniform and well-defined CuO cauliflowers have been prepared via a simple hydrothermal route, which form through the “oriented attachment (OA)–preferential growth–Ostwald ripening (OR)” processes. Furthermore, the CuO cauliflowers show a much higher activity than the irregular CuO for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). Its apparent rate constant (0.0156min−1) is 5.24 times higher than that (0.0025min−1) of the latter. The higher activity is mainly attributed to its higher crystallinity (84.02% vs. 62.86%), which can reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. Graphical abstract CuO cauliflowers show a higher degradation activity of RhB than the irregular one, which has been mainly attributed to its higher crystallinity. Keywords CuO cauliflowers Crystallinity Photocatalytic 1 Introduction CuO, as a p-type semiconductor, has a wide potential applications in various fields, such as gas sensors [1,2], photocatalysts [3–5], optoelectronic devices [6], and so on. To date, various CuO micro/nanostructures, including nanowires [7,8], nanorods [9], nanoribbons [10], dumbbells [11], and flowers [12,13], have been reported. Among them, three-dimensional micro/nanostructures have attracted the interests of researchers, which provide a direct bridge between the nanoscale objects and the macroscale world [14]. For example, Khan et al. have fabricated the flower-like CuO sensor, which shows a higher sensitivity than the Al/ZnO sensor [15]; Yuan et al. have synthesized the porous CuO flowers by an “alkali etching” method, which shows a high cycle stability as the lithium-ion battery electrode [16]; Umadevi et al. have prepared the CuO nanoflowers by the combustion method using glycine as the fuel [17]. However, these preparation methods are complicated or expensive. It is desirable to explore a simple method to synthesize the new micro/nanostructures. Herein, we report the synthesis of the novel CuO cauliflowers by a simple hydrothermal method without using any surfactants or templates. The sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), nitrogen sorption isotherms, etc. A plausible mechanism was proposed to understand the formation of the CuO cauliflowers. Also its photocatalytic activity has been investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation All the chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used without further purification. 2.1.1 CuO cauliflowers Typically, 1.25g of CuSO4 was dissolved in 20mL of deionized water to form a blue solution. Under stirring, 20mL of 0.5M NaOH solution was added to the solution. After being stirred for several minutes, 7g methenamine was added to the above suspension. Then the mixture was transferred into a 50-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by the hydrothermal treatment at 120°C for 20h. After being cooled to the room temperature naturally, the sample was separated by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times, and dried overnight at 60°C. To understand the formation of CuO, the time-dependent experiments were conducted at 120°C for 3h, 9h, 12h and 20h, while keeping the other conditions constant; and also, the temperature-dependent experiments were conducted at 80, 100, 120 and 160°C for 20h, while keeping the other conditions constant, respectively. 2.1.2 Irregular CuO Under stirring, 40mL of 0.5M NaOH was directly added to 20mL of 0.785M CuSO4 solution, and a blue precipitate formed immediately. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 50-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 120°C for 20h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the sample was obtained using the same procedures as discussed above. 2.2 Characterization The size and morphology of the sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU-1510), operating at 120kV. The sample was coated with a 5-nm-thick gold layer before observation. The crystal phases of the sample were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2550VB) using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154nm), operating at 40kV and 50mA. The XRD patterns were scanned in the range of 20–80° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 5°min−1. The fine structure of the sample was observed through the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100) with an acceleration voltage of 200kV, equipped with electron diffractometer. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were performed at 77K on the NOVOE 4000 physicoadsorption apparatus. The surface areas are calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. 2.3 Photocatalytic degradation reaction Photocatalytic activities of the samples were tested by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). Typically, 0.1g of powders was put into a solution of RhB (200ml, 8mgL−1), which was irradiated with a 300W Xe arc lamp equipped with a UV–visible light. Before the lamp was turned on, the suspension was stirred continuously for 30min in the dark to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The concentration of RhB was determined by colorimetry using a UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2500 PC) at a wavelength of 550nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the typical CuO cauliflowers Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the typical sample prepared at 120°C for 20h. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to those of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS 05-0661). No impurity peaks, e.g., Cu(OH)2, Cu and Cu2O, can be detected, indicating that the phase-pure CuO has formed. As observed from Fig. 1b,c, the uniform and well-defined cauliflowers have been obtained, whose average sizes are about 10μm. Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM images of the CuO cauliflowers. The single crystalline nature of the CuO cauliflowers can be revealed by the electron diffraction pattern (the inset of Fig. 1d). The lattice fringe spacing is determined to be 0.23nm, which can be indexed to the (111) facet of monoclinic CuO, suggesting that the CuO cauliflowers grow preferentially along the [111] direction. 3.2 Influences of reaction temperature and time on the samples First, the effect of hydrothermal temperature on the samples has been investigated. Fig. 2(a–d) shows the SEM images of the samples at different temperatures. It is found that the CuO cauliflowers can only form at 120°C, whereas the aggregated and irregular particles are obtained at 80, 100 and 160°C. Moreover, Fig.2e shows that at 80 and 100°C, the as-formed samples consist of Cu(OH)2 and CuO, while Cu form at 160°C. It is clear that the reaction temperature has a significant influence on the crystal phase and morphology of the sample. It has been reported [4] that at the elevated temperatures, methenamine can hydrolyze according to the chemical reaction as follows: (1) (CH2)6 N4 +H2O→6 HCHO+4 NH3. Under the hydrothermal conditions, the chemical reactions may occur as follows: (2) NH3 +H2O→NH4 + +OH− (3) Cu(OH)2 →CuO+H2O (4) Cu(OH)2 +HCHO→Cu+H2O+CO2. We hold that these reactions are competitive, which are strongly dependent on the temperatures. As a result, we could assume that at low temperatures (80 and 100°C), the formed Cu(OH)2 cannot convert completely into CuO by dehydration [12], leading to the formation of both CuO and Cu(OH)2. At 120°C, the phase-pure CuO forms. At a high temperature (160°C), however, Cu(OH)2 can be reduced to Cu by the in-situ generated HCHO. Furthermore, the time-dependent experiments have been performed in order to explore the crystal growth process. When the hydrothermal time is 3h, only the irregular Cu(OH)2 particles can be obtained, as confirmed by Fig. 3a and e. When the reaction time was increased to 9h, some of the unclear petals can be observed in the inset of Fig. 3b, although the particles agglomerate, and the sample consists of both Cu(OH)2 and CuO (Fig. 3e). At 12h, the phase-pure CuO cauliflowers form, as confirmed by Fig. 3c and e. At 20h, the petals can be observed clearly, and the uniform and well-defined CuO cauliflowers form (Fig. 3d and e). Further prolonging the time to 32h, the morphology of CuO cauliflowers does not vary (not shown). 3.3 The plausible formation mechanism of the CuO cauliflowers A few studies have reported that methenamine (HMTA) can act as additive to control the growth of materials [4,12,18,19]. We have tried to use HCHO or NH3·H2O, instead of methenamine to prepare CuO while keeping all the other factors constant. However, the CuO cauliflowers have not formed. It has been reported that HMTA can complex with Cu2+ ions to form [Cu(HMTA)2]2+ [20]. As a result, the Cu2+ ions in the complex can be released slowly under hydrothermal conditions. On the other hand, methenamine would hydrolyze to produce OH−, NH4 + and HCHO under hydrothermal conditions [4,21]. The released OH− will combine with the released Cu2+ to form Cu(OH)2; then Cu(OH)2 converts to CuO by the dehydration process. Therefore, we hold that a synergistic effect of both methenamine and its hydrolysis product (OH−) leads to the formation of cauliflowers. Furthermore, the formation of a few blurry petals indicates that the CuO nanoparticles begin to grow, as confirmed by Fig. 3b and e. Fig. 3f shows the peak intensity ratio of (111)/(113) at different reaction times. With prolonging the reaction time, the (111)/(113) ratio increases from 2 to 4.5, indicating that the (111) plane grows preferentially. It is reasonable that an Ostwald ripening is also involved in the growth progress, in which the nanoparticles undergo the dissolvation and recrystallization processes to form the well-defined CuO cauliflowers. According to the analyses above, a plausible process is proposed in Scheme 1 . We hold that the uniform and well-defined CuO cauliflowers form from the Cu(OH)2 intermediates. At the initial stage, the Cu(OH)2 nanocrystals form through the reaction between Cu2+ and OH− ions. With prolonging the reaction time, the Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles grow into the petal-like particles, which then organize to form cauliflowers through oriented attachment [22–24]. It is noted that the phase transformation from Cu(OH)2 to CuO will occur simultaneously. Therefore, we could assume that oriented attachment (OA) or self-assembly, preferential growth and Ostwald ripening (OR) are all involved in the formation of CuO cauliflowers. 3.4 Degradation activity of the CuO cauliflowers Fig. 4a shows the photocatalytic activities of the typical samples for the degradation of RhB dye. The CuO cauliflowers obtained at 20h show a higher activity than the others. In Fig. 4b, the apparent rate constant (0.0156min−1) of the CuO cauliflowers obtained at 20h is 1.93 times as high as that (0.0081min−1) of the sample at 9h, which can be ascribed to their different crystalline phases. As shown in Fig. 3e, the former is the phase-pure CuO, but the latter is composed of both CuO and Cu(OH)2. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the CuO cauliflowers synthesized at 20h is significantly higher than that of the irregular CuO; the apparent rate constant (0.0156min−1) of RhB over the CuO cauliflowers is 5.24 times higher than that (0.0025min−1) of the irregular sample. The nitrogen sorption isotherms show that the irregular CuO has a higher surface area than the CuO cauliflowers (6.9 vs. 3.3m2 g−1). Herein the crystallinity of both samples is mainly considered. The crystallinity of photocatalyst is important to photo-degradation reaction, which is closely relative to the crystal defects [25]. It has been demonstrated that the bulk defects of photocatalyst are generally believe to be the recombination centers for both electrons and holes, resulting in a low photocatalytic activity; but surface defects favor for the charge separation, leading to the improvement of photocatalytic activity [25]. Although the irregular CuO has a higher surface area than the CuO cauliflowers, the CuO cauliflowers have a greatly higher crystallinity (84.02%) than (62.86%) the irregular CuO. A higher crystallinity of the CuO cauliflowers means a less defects [25], which could be attributed to the higher photocatalytic activity. A schematic diagram for electron transfer process is described in Scheme 2 . Under irradiation, the electrons in valent band can be excited to the conducting band of CuO, the holes are generated in valence band. The generated electrons and holes would migrate from bulk to the crystal surface. During the process, the electrons and holes can combine again if there are more bulk defects, leading to a low charge separation efficiency. On the other hand, the photogenerated electrons can be captured by the surface defect, leading to a high charge separation efficiency, which then leads to a high activity. The pollutants would be oxidized by the generated active species (e.g., holes, hydroxyl radicals, superoxides) formed on the CuO surfaces [21,26,27]. Moreover, the total organic carbon (TOC) value of the irradiated solution is analyzed to evaluate the mineralization of RhB over CuO cauliflowers under UV irradiation (Fig. 5 ). The initial TOC value before irradiation is determined to be 21.55mg/L, and then the value decreases gradually under irradiation, which confirms the progressive mineralization of RhB resulting from a rapid and efficient decomposition of aromatic intermediates [19]. The maximum TOC removal of RhB reached 62.2% at the point that the solution was discolored completely (80min of irradiation), which indicated that some organic carbon (7.11mgL−1) was still left in the solution. The reason might be attributed to a little residual HMTA remained in CuO cauliflowers. 4 Conclusions The uniform CuO cauliflowers can be prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The CuO cauliflowers show a high activity due to its high crystallinity.
