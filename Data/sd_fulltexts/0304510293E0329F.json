Zhang, A. Kladi, X.E. Verykios* Institute of Chemical Engineering and High Temperature Chemical Processes, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Patras, GR-26500 Patras, Greece (Received 8 December 1993) Abstract Structural alterations of highly dispersed Rh/Ti02 catalyst upon CO adsorption and desorption was investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. It was found that, during CO adsorption and desorption, the inter-conversions between the three adsorbed species, namely linear Rh\"CO at ca. 2070 cm-', bridged Rh CO at 1865-1900 cm-' and gem dicarbonyl Rh'(CO)Z at 2096 and 2032 cm-', involve some unstable intermediate species. The CO adsorption at 300 K, resulted in the disruption of rhodium crystallites to isolated rhodium sites, and was found to proceed via a bridged RhZCO species ( at ca. 2005 cm-') as intermediate. The decarbonylation of supported Rh'(CO)2 at elevated temperatures, which leads to the agglomeration of rhodium sites, takes place involving Rh2 CO and Rh'CO (at ca. 2087 cm-') as intermediates. In addition to alteration of the dispersive state of rhodium, the structure of the Ti02 carrier was also observed to be changed during the adsorption of CO at 300 K, as manifested by the enhancement or depletion of surface hydroxyl groups on the carrier. The presence of hydrogen significantly promoted the decarbonylation of Rh'(CO)2, via a process which did not involve Rh2C0 and Rh'CO as intermediates. While no chemical reaction between the gem dicarbonyl species and hydrogen was observed in the temperature range of 300-450 K, dissociation of the C-O bond and formation of hydrocarbon fragments, mainly originating from the bridged adsorbed CO, already occurred at temperatures as low as 325 K.

Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (7994) 229-246 mylation of olefins. Considerable effort has been extended toward the characterization of the surface state of rhodium on oxide supports [ 1-5]. Since the finding that the presence of gaseous CO can induce a significant change in the dispersion, state of rhodium on the surface, many studies have focused on the use of infrared spectroscopy as a means of probing the interaction of CO with supported rhodium catalysts [3-7] . It is now generally recognized that the adsorption of CO onto supported rhodium generates three primary carbonyl species, i.e. linear RhCO which is detected at 2045-2070 cm-', bridged RhZCO at 1850-1900 cm-' and gem dicarbonyl Rh'(CO)2 at ca. 2100 and 2030 cm-'. While the reason for forming the linear and bridged adsorbed species is rather straightforward, significant controversy exists concerning the origin of gem dicarbonyl species and their interconversion with other adsorbed species. Primet [8] proposed that Rh'(CO)Z forms via dissociation of CO which results in the oxidation of Rho to Rh' by oxygen adatoms. However, his proposal has been questioned by subsequent studies which showed that the gem dicarbonyl species is already formed at temperatures much lower than those required for CO dissociation [9,10]. Hyde et al. [ 11 ] proposed an alternative model according to which electrons are transferred from the Rho atoms into the A1203 support so that Rh with a partial positive charge is formed. However, this model cannot properly explain the appearance of gem dicarbonyl species on Rh/Ti02 and Rh/SiOz, as in these catalysts the work function of the support is lower than that of the metal. In contrast to the above explanations, Brenner and Hucul [ 12,13 ] suggested that the reduction of OH- groups on the support may be responsible for Rh' formation. This suggestion was later supported by a number of subsequent studies, particularly by the work of Yates and co-workers [ 14] and Solymosi and Pasztor [ 15] who found a correlation between the development of gem dicarbonyl and the consumption of the isolated OHgroups on the support. It is noted, however, that recent work by Evans et al. [ 16] does not support the above idea. By examining the phase changes of rhodium on TiOz (110), these authors did not find any evidence connecting the formation of gem dicarbonyl and the reduction of surface OH- groups. They, therefore, proposed that the rather facile reaction converting Rho to Rh' on the Ti02 (110) surface is more likely to be associated with a small concentration of surface defects (oxygen vacancies) which can provide sites of variable local stoichiometry. By studying adsorption of CO on Rh/A120, at various temperatures, Yates and Haller [ 17] found that the Rh'(CO)Z species probably interacts with a CO species which is adsorbed on the A1203 carrier. It is noted that while the majority of infrared studies have focused on Rh/A1203 [ 1114] and Rh/Si02 [18,19], some detailed work on Rh/Ti02 has been carried out in recent years [ 16,20-22] . A survey of the literature shows that the interaction of CO with Rh/Ti02 is still rather unclear, as compared to that with Rh/A1203 and Rh/Si02, probably due to the specific interaction of TiOz with rhodium, which makes the processes complicated. A study on Rh/Ti0= is of interest because this system is capable of inducing the Strong MetalSupport Interaction (SMSI) state. Using EXAFS to study the Rh/TLO= system, Resasco and Haller [ 23,24] showed that the interaction between Rh and reducible Ti02 is so strong, that even a direct Rh-Ti bonding is formed when the catalyst is reduced at 773 K. The influence of the carrier on CO hydrogenation over supported Rh was investigated in detail by Katzer et al. [25,26]. The authors found that the order of activity of CO hydrogenation Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 231 is: Rh/Ti02>Rh/Al.03>Rh/SiO2- In terms of selectivity, Rh/Si02 produces mainly methane, while Rh/T'02 produces the largest amount of higher hydrocarbons. In a previous study in this laboratory [ 27 ] , the interaction of CO with Rh dispersed on Ti02, Si02 and A1203 was investigated employing TPD and TPR techniques as well as steady-state kinetic measurements of CO hydrogenation. The results showed that the Rh/ Ti02 catalyst, which showed much higher specific catalytic activity than Rh/Si02 and Rh/ A1203 catalysts, exhibits a unique interaction with CO. This is found to be particularly true for the catalysts with low metal loadings (e.g. 0.5 wt.% Rh), on which the metal-support interaction is more pronounced due to its high metal dispersion. In the present study, the interaction of CO with a 0.5 wt.% Rh/Ti02 catalyst of high metal dispersion was investigated employing infrared spectroscopic techniques. The aim of the study was to explore the interaction of CO with Rh, highly dispersed on the Ti02 carrier. The investigation focused not only on the species formed on the Rh surface upon exposure to CO but primarily on structural alterations of the carrier and of the metal particles during the adsorption process and on the reactivity of various adspecies in the presence of HZ. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization Details of the preparation and the characterization procedures of the 0.5 wt.% Rh/Ti02 and 0.5 wt.% Rh/Si02 catalysts employed in the present study have been reported previously [ 27 ] . Briefly, the catalysts were prepared by impregnation of Ti02 (Degussa P25) or Si02 (Alfa Products) with an aqueous solution of RhCl3. After impregnation, the samples were dried in air at 373 K for 18 h, and then reduced at 473 K under hydrogen flow for 2 h. The catalysts were characterized with respect to exposed metallic area and metal dispersion employing room temperature HZ and CO chemisorption. 2.2. Spectroscopic study A Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DRIFT cell was used for the present in situ measurements. The cell, containing ZnSe windows which were cooled by water circulating through blocks in thermal contact with the windows, allowed collection of in situ spectra over the temperature range of 300-600 K and atmospheric pressure. For all spectra reported, a 32-scan data accumulation was carried out at a resolution of 3.0 cm-'. During the measurements, external optics were purged with dry nitrogen in order to minimize the level of water vapor and carbon dioxide in the testing chamber. An IR spectrum obtained under He flow was used as the background to which the spectra, after CO adsorption, were ratioed. The intensity of the IR spectra is presented in the Kubelka-Munk unit for getting a linear change with the concentration of the adsorbing species. In order to observe small changes in band intensity, subtraction procedures were often used to obtain difference spectra between those measured under different conditions. 50-70 mg of sample which had been previously finely powdered, were placed onto the sample holder. The sample surface was carefully flattened in order to obtain high IR 232 ZG. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-24o reflectivity. Before exposure to CO, the sample was pretreated in the following sequence: heating the sample to 573 K under He flow; maintaining at 573 K under hydrogen flow for one hour; switching the flow to He and keeping at 573 K for half an hour; decreasing the sample temperature to 300 K under He flow. The sample was subsequently exposed to a 10% CO in He mixture flowing over it at a rate of 20 cm'/min and spectra were recorded approximately every minute. All gases (CO, He, HZ) employed in the IR experiments were of ultra-high purity and were further purified by passing them through an Oxisorb oxygen trap that reduced the impurity level to less than 0.1 ppm. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Quantities of Hz and CO adsorbed on supported Rh catalysts The supported Rh catalysts employed in the present investigation (i.e. Rh/Si02 and Rh/ Ti02) were characterized in terms of their degree of dispersion by selective equilibrium HZ and CO adsorption at room temperature. The volume of HZ and CO adsorbed at monolayer coverage was used to estimate the H/Rh and CO/Rh ratios (number of hydrogen atoms or CO molecules adsorbed over the total number of Rh atoms in the catalyst), respectively, assuming that each rhodium atom adsorbs one hydrogen atom or one CO molecule (Table 1) . The H/Rh ratios thus estimated were found to be 1.66 for Rh/Si02 and 0.79 for Rh/ Ti02, indicating that the catalysts had a good metal dispersion. Hydrogen-to-metal ratios of supported metal catalysts larger than unity have also been observed by other investigators [27,28] and they have been attributed to spill-over of hydrogen from the metal to support or to the multiple adsorption of hydrogen on rhodium sites. In an EXAFS study of a 0.57 wt. % Rh/A1203 catalyst by Prins and co-workers [ 10], it has been shown that the surface of the catalyst, which exhibits a H/Rh ratio of 1.7, as measured by HZ adsorption, is actually dominated by small rhodium crystallites consisting of 6-10 atoms. Similarly, based on the H/Rh ratios of the present catalysts, it can be estimated that the rhodium crystallites, highly dispersed on the Ti02 and S'OZ carriers, consist of a small number of atoms. The CO/Rh ratios of the present catalysts are not only found to be different than the H/ M ratios but also to vary in the opposite direction. Thus, Rh/Si02 exhibits a higher H/Rh Table 1 HZ and CO adsorption capacity of Rh/Ti0z and Rh/Si02 catalysts Catalyst V\"/ml-g-' H/Rh' CO/Rh' 0.5% Rh/ H, CO Ti02 0.39 1.97 0.72 1.80 Si02 0.91 0.86 1.66 0.79 'Quantity of gas adsorbed at equilibrium at room temperature. n Assuming that each rhodium atom adsorbs one hydrogen atom or one CO molecule.

As has been shown in previous studies [ 14,15 ] and will also be discussed in the present study, the dispersion of Rh is significantly affected by the presence of CO. The interaction of CO with the Rh crystallites induces their restructuring on the surface of the carrier, which alters the number of exposed Rh atoms and thus the CO adsorption capacity of the catalysts. Apparently, the degree of surface restructuring of the Rh particles is affected by the carrier, and is significantly promoted by Ti02, as compared to Si02. This issue is addressed in more detail in a subsequent section. 3.2. Structural alteration of Rh particles upon CO adsorption and desorption IR spectra of CO adsorbed on 0.5% Rh/Ti02 and 0.5% Rh/Si02 catalysts (for comparison) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. In addition to a band due to gaseous CO, which appears as a shoulder at ca. 2122 cm-',five absorption bands on Rh/TiOZ and four absorption bands on Rh/Si02 can be clearly distinguished. The gaseous CO band can be removed by passing He flow through the IR cell at 300 K, a step which does not alter the absorption bands. The absorption bands at ca. 2070 and at ca. 1865-1900 cm- ` are identified as linear (1) and bridged (11) adsorbed CO species, respectively, on rhodium crystallites. The twin bands at 2096 and 2032 cm-' are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretching frequencies of gem dicarbonyl on the isolated Rh' sites (III) [3-7]. The broad band at 1865-1900 cm-' may consist of two types of bridged adsorbed CO 'm 0.5% Rh/Ti02 1 O 76 Torr CO 300 K B 10 min d c 2 50 2050 1 50 1 501750 WAVENUMBER ( cm') Fig. 1.

The relative proportion of gem dicarbonyl species (each rhodium site bound with two CO molecules) on Rh/TiOz is around 90%, which is much higher as compared to that on Rh/Si02 (around 62%). This is indeed in agreement with the results shown in Table 1, which indicate that restructuring of rhodium crystallites, induced by CO, is very significant when TiO, is used as the carrier, as indicated by the significantly higher CO/Rh ratio. The absorption band at ca. 2005 cm-' observed on Rh/Ti02 is a unique one since it is not observed over Rh/Si02 (Fig. 2) and has not been referred to in previous studies on Rh/Si02 [ 18,19] and Rh/Ti02 [20-22]. Since this band is positioned between the bands of the linear and bridged CO adsorbed on Rh sites, it appears that it may correspond to CO which is linearly adsorbed on negatively charged rhodium sites or in the bridged form on positively charged rhodium sites. Rice et al. [28] have postulated that a band in the vicinity of 2000-2020 cm-' should arise from a bridged-type Rh'(CO), species. Following the assignment of Rice et al. [28], the band at ca. 2005 cm-', observed in the present study over Rh/TiOz, is assigned to RhzCO species (1V), although it has not been previously detected on Rh/Ti02. It is interesting to note in Fig. 1 that the band due to Rh2 CO at ca. 2005 cm-' is gradually developed and then decreases with increasing CO exposure. This indicates that Rhu`, CO species is only an intermediate species formed during CO chemisorption. The difference spectra between those measured at various exposure times (not shown) indicate that the disappearance of the Rh2C0 band coincides with the enhancement of the band due to the gem dicarbonyl, suggesting the transformation of RhZCO to Rh'(CO)2 with increasing CO Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 235 exposure. This means that the Rht-Rht sites are only a transient species of the disruption of rhodium crystallites, which can be further disrupted into the isolated Rht species on which the gem dicarbonyl species is formed. If this view is correct, it can be further derived that the partial oxidation of rhodium may already occur before the rhodium atoms are atomically isolated. This deduction seems reasonable because, when the rhodium particles are too small (e.g. containing only several metal atoms), they do not preserve their metallic properties. Their interaction with the oxide support may no longer be governed by Schottky junctions [ 29 ] . Meanwhile, such small metal particles are easily attacked by various surface groups, including OH-, inducing the oxidation of the rhodium particles (containing only several atoms) even though the Ti02 support is donating electrons to larger rhodium crystallites (the work function of reduced Ti02 is lower than that of rhodium metal). It has been reported [5,9,25] that the decarbonylation of Rh'(CO)Z on A1203 at elevated temperatures results in the enlargement of rhodium crystallites, a process reverse of that observed during CO adsorption at room temperature. However, this important process is still unclear on Ti02. Buchanan et al. [21 ] showed that desorption of CO from Rh/Ti02 at 523 K was accompanied by a structural change, which led to inactive rhodium crystallites on which no gem dicarbonyl species were formed upon readsorption of CO at room temperature. However, a very recent study [ 16] has demonstrated that the inactive rhodium crystallites were not formed unless the decarbonylation of Rht(CO)Z species on Ti02 was carried out by heating the surface to temperatures as high as 800 K (which are high enough Table 2 Relative intensity (in arbitrary units) of various CO adspecies on Rh/Ti02 samples which have been treated under different conditions prior to CO adsorption at 300 K Experiments Exposure Intensity of adspecies CO band time/min (76 Torr CO) I II III IV Experiment a\" 1 4.3 2.4 3.8 0.4 2 4.9 2.7 5.6 0.7 3 5.3 2.7 7.2 0.9 10 4.8 2.6 9.7 0 Experiment bb 1 4.2 2.0 2.9 0.3 2 4.7 2.2 3.4 0.5 3 4.9 2.1 4.0 0.7 10 4.2 2.1 4.3 0 Experiment c` 1 4.3 2.2 2.8 0.2 2 4.6 2.5 3.5 0.4 3 5.0 2.3 4.2 0.7 10 4.3 2.4 4.4 0 \"CO adsorbed on a fresh sample.

In order to address this issue, the following experiment was conducted: CO was adsorbed on 0.5% Rh/TiO, on which CO had been adsorbed at 300 K and then decarbonylated at 573 K. The features of the resulting spectra are given in Table 2 (Experiment b), in which the corresponding features of the spectra obtained on the fresh sample, (i.e. Fig. 1) are also reported (Experiment a). It is apparent that similar adsorbed species are observed on both surfaces. The intensity of the gem dicarbonyl species is smaller on the surface which had been treated at 573 K. This alteration is exactly the same as that observed on Rh/A1203 [5,9,28] and can be attributed to the enlargement of the rhodium crystallites via sintering induced by CO, which makes the disruption of the Rh-Rh bond more difficult. The relatively low intensity of species IV could also be explained by the slow disruption of rhodium crystallites. Thus, the results of this experiment support those reported by Evans et al. [ 16] on the Rh/Ti0= (110) surface. Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 12T 0 T/K b1b 660 Fig. 4. The dependence of the relative intensities of various adsorbed CO bands on temperature. 237 The desorption of CO from Rh/Ti02 was examined by monitoring the variation of absorption bands as a function of temperature. Before heating the sample under He flow, it was exposed to 76 Torr CO at 300 K until saturation uptake was achieved, and then it was purged with He at 300 K to remove gaseous CO. The sample was subsequently heated under He flow with a heating rate of 10 K/ min and spectra were recorded at selected temperatures. Heating the sample to temperatures up to 400 K results in a small decrease in the intensity of the gem dicarbonyl bands (III) and the appearance of a very weak shouldering band at ca. 2087 cm-' at 400 K. A reduction in the intensities of the linear (I) and bridged (II) bands and a development of a band at ca. 2005 cm- ' were also observed at 350100 K ( see Fig. 3 ) . These observarions suggest that the inter-conversion between adsorbed CO species also occurs during CO desorption. This inter-conversion is more clearly shown in Fig. 4, in which the dependence of the intensity of the various CO bands on temperature is given. Although the development of the band at 2005 cm-' (IV ) appears to coincide with the reduction of the linear band (I), it is more likely that the Rh2C0 (IV) at 2005 cm-' is formed via the agglomeration of the isolated Rht sites at elevated temperatures ( the decrease in the intensity of the gem dicarbonyl (III) between 300-400 K is in agreement with the development of the band at ca. 2005 cm-' ). With further increasing temperature ( > 400 K), the Rh2C0 species disappears again as the extent of agglomeration is enhanced. Similar to the processes occurring during CO adsorption at 300 K, the Rh2'CO (IV) is only an intermediate species during the inter-conversion between the isolated Rh' sites and agglomerated Rhr crystallites. The structural changes of Rh crystallites supported on Ti02 during CO adsorption and desorption can be represented schematically as follows: CO Adsorption intermediate 238 Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 A significant decarbonylation of the gem dicarbonyl species is initiated at 425 K. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a sharp decrease in the intensity of the band due to gem dicarbonyl species coincides with a marked increase in the intensity of the band at 2087 cm-' and with only a small increase of the band due to the linear CO species (2070 cm'). This suggests that in addition to the above decarbonylation scheme, there exist the other parallel decarbonylation pathways which lead to the formation of the bands at ca. 2070 and 2087 cm-'. It appears that the scheme leading to the formation of RhzCO at ca. 2005 cm-' occurs already at temperatures below 400 K, while the decarbonylation pathways to form the bands at ca. 2070 and 2087 cm-' become pronounced at temperatures above 400 K. The band at ca. 2087 cm-', which appears only as a weak shoulder at 400 K now becomes apparent at 425 K. This band was previously observed on a Rh/A'Z03 catalyst during the initial CO adsorption at low temperatures and was assigned as Rh' monocarbonyl species (V) [ 28 ] . This band, which has not been reported on Rh/TiO, is very close to the high frequency band (at ca. 2096 cm-') of the gem dicarbonyl species, therefore, it is frequently overlapped with the band at 2096 cm-', making itself indiscernible in most cases. If the assignment of the 2087 cm-' band is accepted [ 28] , the present results imply that the decarbonylation of Rh'(CO)Z proceeds at temperatures above 400 K mainly following the transformation sequence: Rh'(CO)z -Rh'CO+CO (1) Rh'CO-Rh'+CO (2) Only a small part of Rh'(CO)2 is converted into Rh CO, probably via Rh' CO: Rh'CO + e - - Rh CO (3 ) The decarbonylation of the gem dicarbonyl is completed at 450 K, while a broad band at 2052 cm-' remains with a pronounced tail towards lower wavenumbers and a weak band due to the bridged CO at ca. 1860 cm-'. The very broad band centered at ca. 2052 cm-' may represent the linear species bonded on heterogeneous sites of rhodium crystallites. All absorption bands disappeared upon heating to 573 K. The entire desorption process essentially occurs between 400 and 470 K, which is in agreement with CO TPD results on Rh/ Ti02 [27]. It is worth mentioning that the intermediate species, RhZCO at ca. 2005 cm-' and Rh' CO at ca. 2087 cm-', which arise during the decarbonylation of Rh'(CO)2 on Ti02, are observed for the first time in the present study, offering a better understanding of the elementary steps of Rh'(CO)2 decarbonylation on Ti02, 3.3. Structural changes of Ti02 upon adsorption of CO on RhJTi02 Surface structural changes of Ti02 during the adsorption of CO on Rh/Ti02 were examined by monitoring the alterations of OH- groups as well as H-associated hydroxyl groups on Ti02. As already mentioned in the experimental section, the reduced catalyst was treated in He flow at 573 K for half an hour before exposure to CO. This would exclude the possibility that the surface chemistry results from residual surface hydrogen from the reduction. The spectra showing such alterations during CO adsorption at 300 K are presented Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (/994) 229-246 239 in Fig. 5. The corresponding CO absorption bands are shown in Fig. 1. A clean spectrum of Rh/Ti02, which was taken just prior to CO adsorption was used as background, and all subsequent spectra were recorded after subtracting the background spectrum. Therefore, any changes in this region must be induced by the process of CO adsorption. It is apparent that both, the isolated OH- groups, which are characterized by two sharp bands at 3735 and 3663 cm-' [ 14,21 ], and the H-associated hydroxyl groups, which are characterized by a broad band in the neighborhood of 3502 cm-' [ 14], are concomitantly enhanced during CO adsorption. While the enhancement of the H-associated hydroxyl groups band is already obvious upon the initial exposure, the band due to the isolated OH- groups becomes apparent only after an extended exposure to CO. Since special care was taken to ensure the absence of trace amounts of water in the CO gas stream, it is unlikely that the enhanced H-containing bands are due to adsorbed water on the surface. This is further supported by the failure to observe the band of the bending mode of adsorbed H20 in the 1600-1700 cm-' wavenumber range. Therefore, the enhancement of the bands of hydroxyl groups upon CO exposure indicates that, in addition to the alteration of rhodium dispersion, the structure of the Ti02 carrier is also changed during CO adsorption. The increased amount of H-containing species on the surface may originate from subsurface layers of the Ti02 carrier. During reduction of the Rh/Ti02 catalyst hydrogen atoms can spill over from the Rh crystallites to the Ti02 carrier. These hydrogen atoms may diffuse into the lattice of TiOz to form relatively stable Ti\" /a+ hydride species [30,31 ] .

Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 229-246 these hydrogen species may resurface, due to the participation of Ti02 in the interaction with the CO species. It is interesting to note that the present finding on Rh/Ti02 is significantly different from that reported on Rh/A1,03 and Rh/Si02- On these catalysts, instead of enhancement of surface hydroxyl groups, depletion of the isolated OH- groups was observed and was correlated with the development of the gem dicarbonyl species [ 14] . In order to verify this difference, alterations of OH- groups on 0.5% Rh/S'02 catalyst were also examined during CO adsorption. The results obtained (Fig. 6) show that the two sharp bands at 3737 and 3636 cm-' are depleted with increasing CO exposure (negative peaks), implying that the isolated OH- groups are consumed during CO adsorption. This observation is identical to what has been previously observed over a Rh / S'Oz catalyst by Yates and co-workers [ 14 ] . They observed a sharp negative band at ca. 3741 cm-' and a broad positive band at around 3500 cm-'. The negative band was attributed to depletion of the isolated OH- groups on the Si02 carrier, as a result of the formation of the Rht(CO)Z species, while no detailed explanation was given for the development of the broad band following CO chemisorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface processes on Rh/TiOZ, occurring during CO adsorption, are indeed different than those on Rh/Si02 and Rh/A1203. The unique interaction of Rh/Ti02 catalyst with CO, as compared to Rh/S'Oz and Rh/ A1203, has been revealed by previous TPD and TPR studies [ 27 ] . The present new finding on Rh/Ti02 provides structural information on the interaction of the Rh/T'02 with CO.

(The corresponding CO absorption bands are shown in Fig. 2.) Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 241 can be derived that both rhodium crystallites and the Ti02 support are experiencing structural changes during exposure to CO. The former one is characterized by the attenuation of crystallite size and subsequent formation of isolated gem dicarbonyl species. The latter is indicated by changes in the Ti02 structure, involving the resurfacing of OH- groups and H-associated hydroxyl groups which probably had been formed during reduction of the catalysts. It appears that the unique behavior of Rh/Ti02, as compared to Rh/SiO' and Rh/ A1203, is related to the reducibility of the TiO, support, onto which an appreciable amount of dissociated hydrogen is bound into the carrier lattice as hydroxyl groups and/or Hassociated hydroxyl groups. These types of H-containing species are probably formed during the reduction of the catalyst, via the channel of hydrogen spill-over from the metal. The participation of surface groups from the Ti02 carrier in the interaction with CO has been demonstrated by previous TPD and TPR studies [ 27,32,33 ] . Recently, Falconer and coworkers [32,33] conducted extensive TPR studies of CO adsorbed on noble catalysts dispersed on various carriers. They demonstrated the existence of two distinct CH, formation pathways, one involving the direct hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on the metal surface, and one involving conversion of the metal-adsorbed CO to support-bound methoxy, which is subsequently hydrogenated to CH, The second path was found to depend on the carrier and to be important for Ti02-supported catalysts but not for S'02-supported catalysts. The present results also show that the Ti02 carrier is involved in the interaction with CO, as evidenced by the observation of structural alterations of the Ti02 carrier upon chemisorption 76 Torr CO 300 K 0.2 3498 3664 3736 x 1 /4 d 10 min x 1 /2 c 3 min x1 b e x 1 2 min 1 min 4600 3650 3300 2950 2600 WAVENUMBER (cm') Fig. 7.

Together with the previous TPR and TPD results, it may be derived that, for Rh/Ti02 catalyst, a type of metal-support interaction exists which influences the alteration of the dispersive state of rhodium, induced by CO, accompanied by a structural change of the TiO, carrier. Both of these structural alterations, in turn, result in significant changes in the reactivity of Rh/Ti02 catalysts towards CO. It has to be mentioned that the fact that enhancement and not reduction of the isolated OH- groups was observed on Rh/Ti02 catalyst during CO adsorption (Fig. 5), does not exclude the possibility that the conversion of Rh to Rh' on TiO, proceeds via the consumption of surface isolated OH- groups since the rate of consumption of the hydroxyl groups may be lower than the rate of their resurfacing. In order to further address this issue, a 0.5% Rh/Ti02 catalyst of enlarged metal crystallites (i.e. pretreated at an atmosphere containing 10% CO before reducing at 573 K) was exposed to CO in the usual manner and IR spectra were recorded. The variation of hydroxyl groups during CO adsorption is shown in Fig. 7. The features of the development of CO absorption bands are given in Table 2 (Experiment c). A smaller amount of gem dicarbonyl species is developed on this sample and with a slower rate, as compared to that on the fresh sample (Table 2, Experiment a). Therefore, it may be deduced that more intense bands due to the isolated hydroxyl groups are expected if the formation of gem dicarbonyl species is accompanied by the consumption of isolated OH- groups and resurfacing of H-containing species. As is shown in Fig. 7, more intense bands at ca. 3736 and 3664 cm-' (corresponding to the isolated hydroxyl groups) are indeed observed on the sample with a smaller amount of gem dicarbonyl species. Thus, the results obtained in these experiments strongly support the conclusion that the consumption of OH- groups and the resurfacing of the OH- groups and H-associated hydroxyl groups occur concomitantly during CO adsorption on Rh/TiOz at room temperature. It is apparent that the presence of CO induces structural changes in both the rhodium crystallites and the TiOZ support. 3.4. Reactivity of CO adsorbed on RhMOZ The reactivity of various adsorbed CO species with hydrogen was examined by exposing samples with preadsorbed CO to hydrogen at various temperatures and monitoring changes of the adsorbed CO bands. As shown in Fig. 8, when the sample with adsorbed CO was exposed to hydrogen (760 Torr) at 300 K, the bands due to the linear and bridged CO shifted to lower frequencies by approximately 35 cm -' and 18 cm-', respectively, whereas the position of the bands of the gem dicarbonyl was not altered. These results are in contrast to those observed on Pt [34-36], over which no influence of the dissociative adsorption of HZ was detected on the position of adsorbed CO bands. The changes in band intensity between Fig. 8a and 8b are deceiving. It has been observed that the passing energy gain is reduced in the presence of hydrogen, probably due to reduction of the IR reflectivity of the sample. Heating the sample in the presence of 760 Torr hydrogen did not result in any alteration in the position of the gem dicarbonyl band except for the attenuation of the band intensity. This is in contrast with the case of Rh/Si02 [ 19] on which the formation of gem dicarbonyl hydride species HRh`(CO)Z with a shift towards lower wavenumbers by ca. 10 cm-' was reported.

It is noted that the intermediate Rh2C0 species at ca. 2005 cm- t and RhtCO species at 2087 cm- ~ were not detected during the decarbonylation of gem dicarbonyl in the presence of hydrogen, a result in contrast to that in the absence of hydrogen. This should also be related to the promotional effect of hydrogen on the reduction of Rh' to Rh . Since the band due to the linear adsorbed CO also did not significantly change upon heating from 300 to 400 K, it appears that the decarbonylation of gem dicarbonyl, promoted by hydrogen, mainly occurs as: Rht(CO)2 + zH2 +Oz- - Rh +2C0+OH- (4) which is somewhat different from the process occurring on Rh dispersed on A120, and Si02 [ 5,15,19,28] . The intensity of the broad band due to the bridged CO is observed to decrease with increasing temperature. This band is practically indiscernible after heating the sample in the presence of hydrogen to 350 K. This is in strong contrast to the desorption process in the absence of hydrogen, in which the band due to the bridged CO was still detected at temperatures as high as 450 K (Fig. 6). These results are reasonable since the bridged CO is characterized by strong M-CO bonds and relatively weak C-O bonds. Thus, the shift of 244 Z.G. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 229-246 this band upon exposure to hydrogen is probably due to the coordination of hydrogen onto this site; the disappearance of this band at elevated temperatures may result from the dissociation of the weak C-O bond, assisted by hydrogen. It should be pointed out that earlier studies on Pt catalysts [34-36] have demonstrated that there is no difference in the reactivity of the various adsorbed CO species towards H- The discrepancy between Pt and Rh may be related to the bonding of H, O, and C on the metal surface [ 37 ] . Fig. 9 shows the development of hydrocarbon fragments during the exposure of the adsorbed CO sample to hydrogen at various temperatures. The corresponding alterations of the CO absorption bands are shown in Fig. 8. The bands at 2900-3000 cm-' due to the C-H stretching vibration were observed at temperatures as low as 325 K. This implies that the dissociation of the C-O bond and the addition of hydrogen to carbon occurs on Rh/ Ti02 at temperatures as low as 325 K, a temperature which is much lower than that required for the CO/Hz reaction [27]. The intensity of the C-H band reached a maximum at 350 K and did not change significantly in the temperature range between 350 and 400 K. However, it decreased significantly when the temperature reached 425 K. Considering the results of TPR of adsorbed CO under HZ flow [27], which show that only methane is evolved from the surface of Rh/Ti02, it can be deduced that the decrease of the band at 2900-3000 cm-' is due to the desorption of hydrocarbons, mainly in the form of methane, from the surface. Referring to the corresponding alterations in the CO absorption bands (see Fig. 8), it can be further concluded that the hydrocarbon fragments mainly originate from the bridged 2985 I 0.1 425 K , H2 ~~A~A I9 400 K.

The high reactivity of the bridged adsorbed CO towards hydrogen coincides with its weak C-O bond. It should be pointed out that, although the gem dicarbonyl Rh'(CO)= species does not directly react with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons, the enhanced decarbonylation of the gem dicarbonyl species, promoted by hydrogen (see reaction 4), would alter the dispersive state of the rhodium particles, which, in turn, results in significant changes of the reactivity between hydrogen and the adsorbed CO species (e.g. the bridged adsorbed CO). From this point of view, the gem dicarbonyl Rh' (CO) , species still plays an important role, affecting the reaction between CO and H=. 4. Concluding remarks The most interesting phenomenon resulting from the interaction between CO and supported Rh is the structural alteration of rhodium crystallites, induced by CO. This actually consists of several surface processes which are significantly affected by the type of carrier employed, as well as the rhodium particle size. The present detailed infrared study of CO chemisorption on a highly dispersed Rh/TiOz catalyst disclosed that the disruption of the Rh-Rh bond, as manifested by the formation of gem dicarbonyl species, involves the alteration and inter-conversion of linear and bridged bound CO species, as well as intermediate species, e.g. RhZCO (see Fig. 1). This is also found to be true for the decarbonylation of adsorbed CO species on Rh/Ti02 at elevated temperatures, although the extent and direction of inter-conversion between various adsorbed species are different (see Figs. 3 and 4). It appears that the interaction of CO with Rh/TiO, is rather unique as compared to that with Rh/Si02 and Rh/A1203. It results not only in significant changes in the dispersive state of rhodium crystallites but also in alterations of the surface structure of the Ti02 carrier, as revealed by the enhanced and depleted bands of hydroxyl groups on the catalysts pretreated differently (see Figs. 5-7). The structural change of the Ti02 carrier during CO chemisorption implies that the Ti02 carrier also participates, to a certain extent, in the interaction with the reactant. This type of metal-support interaction may be related to the high catalytic activity of Rh/Ti02 in CO hydrogenation. It should be pointed out that although the interaction of CO with supported Rh has been extensively studied and the formation of stable adsorbed CO species (i.e. linear, bridged and gem dicarbonyl species) are well documented, the detailed processes of the interconversion between the various adsorbed species during CO adsorption and desorption is still largely unknown. The present study was motivated by recent results obtained in this laboratory, which showed that the unique properties of Rh/TiOz, as compared to Rh/Si02 and Rh/A'Z03, are more pronounced when the rhodium dispersion is high [ 27 ] . The present detailed IR study of CO interaction with a highly dispersed Rh catalyst has revealed new information concerning the intermediate species, such as Rh2C0 at ca. 2005 cm-' and RhtCO at ca. 2087 cm-', produced during the adsorption of CO at room temperature and CO desorption at elevated temperatures. These results offer a better understanding of the 246 Z.L. Zhang et al. /Journal of Molecular CataNsis 89 (1994) 229-246 mechanism of the influence of the carrier on the specific activity of Rh in reactions involving CO. 5. References [ 11 L. Guczi, in L.

Structural alterations of highly dispersed Rh/TiO2 catalyst upon CO adsorption and desorption was investigated by Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. It was found that, during CO adsorption and desorption, the inter-conversions between the three adsorbed species, namely linear Rh0CO at ca. 2070 cm−1, bridged RH0 2CO at 1865–1900 cm−1 and gem dicarbonyl RhI(CO)2 at 2096 and 2032 cm−1, involve some unstable intermediate species. The CO adsorption at 300 K, resulted in the disruption of rhodium crystallites to isolated rhodium sites, and was found to proceed via a bridged RhI 2CO species (at ca. 2005 cm−1) as intermediate. The decarbonylation of supported RhI(CO)2 at elevated temperatures, which leads to the agglomeration of rhodium sites, takes place involving RhI 2CO and RhICO (at ca. 2087 cm−1) as intermediates. In addition to alteration of the dispersive state of rhodium, the structure of the TiO2 carrier was also observed to be changed during the adsorption of CO at 300 K, as manifested by the enhancement or depletion of surface hydroxyl groups on the carrier. The presence of hydrogen significantly promoted the decarbonylation of RhI(CO)2, via a process which did not involve RhI 2CO and RhICO as intermediates. While no chemical reaction between the gem dicarbonyl species and hydrogen was observed in the temperature range of 300–450 K, dissociation of the CO bond and formation of hydrocarbon fragments, mainly originating from the bridged adsorbed CO, already occurred at temperatures as low as 325 K.
