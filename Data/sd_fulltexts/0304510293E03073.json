Overton* University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK Abstract The Cr-silica catalyst system is commercially important in the polymerisation of ethene. This catalyst is made much more active by the inclusion of small quantities of titanium. This study attempts to identify the nature of any new species which may be formed by investigation of a series of titanium and magnesium modified Cr-silica catalysts. TPR experiments of the modified catalysts showed evidence for two new surface species. These species exhibited increased thermal stability with respect to the surface chromate and dichromate-like species already present and approximated to aggregates of titanium or magnesium chromate and dichromate. Key words: chromium; ethene; modified catalysts; polymerization; silica 1. Introduction As previously reported [ 1 ] , when the chromium loading is approximately 1 % the silica surface is predominantly covered by chromate-like species accompanied by varying amounts of dichromate-like species and aggregates of Cr03. The relative abundance of these species depends upon chromium loading, preparation method and activation conditions. The inclusion of small amounts of titanium has a promotional effect on the polymerisation activity of the catalysts [ 2] . This investigation examines the effect of incorporating small amounts of titanium or magnesium in several ways. TPR studies gave an indication of the number of surface species. The possible identities of any new species are discussed. *Corresponding author; fax. ( +44-482)470225. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Impregnation of promoters Samples were prepared in which a high surface area silica (EP10, surface area 300 m2 g-', ex Crosfield Chemicals, UK) was impregnated at room temperature with a methanolic solution of either titanium (IV) isopropoxide or magnesium acetate in order to give approximately 1 % Ti or Mg on the support. Following drying at 100 C, these samples were then impregnated with a methanolic solution of Cr03 and again dried. These samples will be referred to as, for example, 1% Cr(Ti). Two industrial catalysts, EP20 and EP30, have been described previously [ 1 ] . These samples were each impregnated with a methanolic solution of either the titanium or the magnesium species described above to give samples which contained approximately 1 % chromium and 1% Ti or Mg. These samples will be referred to as, for example, EP20 (Ti). 2.2. Inclusion of promoters in support Two silica gel supports were prepared by coprecipitation in which approximately I % of titanium or magnesium had been incorporated into the gel [ 3 ] . These supports were subsequently impregnated with methanolic solutions of Cr03. and will be referred to as, for example, 1% Cr-Si/Ti. 2.3. Temperature programmed reduction The TPR apparatus has been described previously [ 1 ] . Samples were activated in situ in dry, flowing air for 5 h at 600 C prior to reduction. The reducing gas was 10% Hz/Ar at a flow rate of 35 cm3 min-' and samples were heated from 20 C up to 900 C at a rate of 10 C min-'. The resulting complex reduction profiles were subjected to computer-aided deconvolution, enabling the position and relative proportion of each overlapping component to be estimated. 2.4. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy UV-vis reflectance spectra were obtained using a Unicam SP700 spectrophotometer fitted with a SP735 diffuse reflectance accessory. 2.5. SIMS Time of flight SIMS experiments were performed on a VG lonex 1X2SS instrument with a working pressure of less than 10-s mbar. \"Ga+ primary ions were used as the pulsed source with an equivalent current of 0.5 pA on the sample surface and a pulse frequency of the order of 8 kHz. A. Ellison, TL Overton /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 81-86 83 3. Results 3.1. TPR Three standards were prepared which contained approximately 1 % Cr as chromium trioxide, sodium chromate and sodium dichromate mixed with EP 10 silica. These samples were subjected to reduction under the same conditions as the samples. The deconvolution of the TPR profiles of Cr-silica catalysts has been reported elsewhere [ 1 ] . Four chromium species were detected; Cr,, and CrB approximated to aggregates of Cr03, Cry was chromate-like and Crp was dichromate-like.

These species exhibited an increased stability towards reduction having Tm in the ranges 560-600 C and 650-600 C respectively. 3.2. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy The presence of dichromate like species can be confirmed by detection of an absorption maxima at approximately 21,500 cm-'. Absorption maxima for a number of \"standards\" and samples are given in Tables 4 and 5. A. Ellison, T.L. Overton /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 81-86 85 3.3. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy All of the samples exhibited SiO, CrO and mixed Si-Cr fragments. which is also usual for unmodified samples [ 1 ] . In addition to these families of fragments, some of the modified samples produced TiO and Ti-CrO or MgO and Mg-CrO fragments, indicating the possibility of titanium-chromium or magnesium-chromium near neighbours. 4. Discussion When the Cr-silica catalysts were modified by the inclusion of approximately 1% Ti or 1 % Mg the most abundant species present was chromate-like and was accompanied by aggregates of Cr03. Dichromate-like species, which were normally present in an unmodified sample, were not present but two new species were detected. These showed increased stability towards reduction and their temperature of peak maxima, Tm, were similar to those of \"bulk\" chromate and dichromate species. Diffuse reflectance measurements indicated the presence of dichromate species on some samples even when the surface dichromate, CrD, was not detected. The occurrence of this absorption coincided with the detection of CrE and CrF by TPR. Therefore, one of these new species could be responsible for this absorption and would, therefore, be dichromatelike. SIMS analysis detected mixed Si-Cr fragments, indicating that some of the chromium was in close contact with the support, and Cr205 fragments indicating the possible presence of dichromate or polychromate-like species. Mixed Cr-Ti and Cr-Mg families of fragments were also observed, indicating the possible existence of Cr-Ti or Cr-Mg near neighbours on the surface. The occurrence of these fragments always coincided with the detection of CrF, and Cr, by TPR. Therefore, the occurrence of CrE and CrF was always accompanied by Cr-Ti or Cr-Mg fragments in the SIMS spectra and by the observation of an absorption band due to dichromate-like species in the UV-vis reflectance spectrum. It would seem likely, therefore, that CrE and CrF arose from interaction between the chromium and the dopant species, giving rise to mixed Cr-Mg or Cr-Ti entities, one of which may be dichromate-like. This interaction occurred regardless of the method of sample preparation but occurred more readily with titanium than with magnesium species. It was observed when the dopant species was impregnated prior to or following impregnation of the chromium, but, more surprisingly, even when the dopant species was incorporated into the support. In this case 1% Ti or Mg was dispersed throughout a large surface area silica gel. What proportion of the dopant species was available at the surface of the support is not known but interaction between the chromium and the dopant species still occurred. 86 A. Ellison, T L. Overton /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 81-86 Other authors [4] have reported that incorporating small quantities of titanium into the catalyst leads to the formation of more easily reduced species. The Ti and Mg containing species in this study were less reducible with hydrogen than unmodified species. TPR gives a direct indication of the reducibility of a species although, unfortunately, reduction with CO or ethene was not possible. During a polymerisation reaction the chromium species would be reduced with ethene or pre-reduced with carbon monoxide. References [ 1 ] A. Ellison, T.L. Overton, L. Bencze, J. Chem. Soc.
