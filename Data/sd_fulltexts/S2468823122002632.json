PdCo bimetallic catalysts were synthesized using oleyamine and oleaic acid as capping agents to effectively disperse the metals over activated carbon via incipient impregnation. The synthesis, in conjunction with the carbon support, resulted in single-atom dispersion of Co over the carbon with the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Thermal activation of the catalysts, under a reducing atmosphere, allowed sufficient Pd and Co mobility leading to the formation of a PdCo alloy, according to STEM, in situ XRD and XANES analysis. Furthermore, molar percentages between 0.2 to 0.3 in Co were effective in producing Pd nanoparticles that are partially decorated with Co to produce a highly active catalyst for CO oxidation. The optimized catalyst formulation and synthesis method provide active sites for CO absorption onto Pd while maintaining active sites, in close proximity, for O2 activation via Co. The resulting catalyst showed a marked reduction in CO light-off temperatures compared to the monometallic formulations. Image, graphical abstract Keywords CO oxidation PdCo bimetallic Single-atom catalyst STEM In situ XRD and XANES characterization 1 Introduction Bifunctional catalysts comprising two metals and their oxides supported on inert matrixes are widely investigated in heterogeneous catalysis [1–4]. This interest is derived from the synergic properties arising from metal-promoter interactions, which typically originates from the addition of a more oxyphilic metal onto a noble metal, such as AuCu [5], PdCo [6], and PtFe [7]. In these systems, the nature of the alloying and segregation of the nanoalloys (or active phase) plays a significant role in promoting or, in some cases, hindering catalytic activity. For example, Destro et al.[5] showed that catalysts comprising AuCu nanoparticles (NPs) supported on SiO2 are highly susceptible to changes in the pretreatment conditions which affect the alloy composition and either promotes or suppresses CO oxidation. The effect is partially linked to the formation of CuOx species adjacent to the (de)alloyed AuCu-NPs. Hence, careful consideration of these effects is important to understand the interaction between the metals and their behaviour under catalytic conditions. Furthermore, a variety of chemical and physical parameters relating to bimetallic catalysts have been investigated such as, alloy composition [1,5,8–10], core-shell formation [10,11], single atmos formation [12–21],phase crystallinity [22], particle size and particle distribution [5] as well as the influence of the support on the catalytic performance [23,24]. In general, studies commence from samples with well-controlled composition and particle size, their response to thermal treatment, catalytic environment and interaction with the supports are then explored. Recently, Wu et al. [10] used surface characterization techniques and CO oxidation as a probe catalytic reaction to provide important insights into the promotional effect of adding Co to Pd based catalysts. Their valuable discoveries showed that Pd and Co play different roles in the catalytic reaction whereby CO is absorbed onto Pd, O2 is then activated at the Co sites, then, depending on the active particle boundaries and interfaces and the proximity of both metals, CO and O interaction is facilitated to form CO2. According to the studies, there is a fine balance between Pd and Co ratios which leads to improved CO conversions. Less than a monolayer of Co on Pd is required, otherwise, CoOx species will hinder CO adsorption onto Pd. The proximity between these metals and an optimal ratio between Pd and Co creates synergic effects which are not merely a linear combination of their monometallic counterparts and generate unique active sites to improve the efficacy of the catalytic reactions [10]. Probe reactions such as the oxidation of carbon monoxide can offer insights into the behaviour of active sites and aid in elucidating reasons for observed catalytic activity for more complex reaction systems, such as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derived chemicals and various electrochemical reactions [1,22]. Although CO oxidation in the presence of O2 is considered a relatively simple reaction, the mechanistic steps occurring during this reaction and their correlation with the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst provide valuable information. However, the interpretation of the catalytic data relating to bimetallic catalysts is not trivial. For example, the hysteresis features of CO oxidation reactions over noble metal nanoparticles dispersed on a variety of supports have been studied [23,25] with no general agreement being reached. This lack of consensus arises from the complexity of the catalytic process that involves adsorption, diffusion, multiple reaction rate kinetics and surface interactions followed by desorption [23,25]. The mechanism underpinning hysteresis features has been explained via the existence of multiple steady states during CO interaction with the catalyst surface [23,25–27]. In the work published by Casapu et al. [26], a direct correlation between the hysteresis feature and the Pt nanoparticle size was determined. CO oxidation over noble metal nanoparticles of 2 nm resulted in an inverse hysteresis. In contrast, larger Pt nanoparticles resulted in typical hysteresis for the CO oxidation reaction. This was attributed to differences in the adsorption strength of CO onto the active sites of the catalyst with variations noted between surface/bulk sites, and the degree of oxidation of the Pt nanoparticles [26]. In this work, the CO oxidation reaction is used to probe PdCo bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon. Moreover, pourous, high surface area [28] activated carbon was chosen as a support due to its favourable chemical interaction with Co to produce highly dispersed cobalt anchored on carbon [29]. Furthermore, activated carbon exhibits acid-base chemical properties, can be easily functionalized, and presents electrical conductivity [28,30]. These characteristics make the catalysts studied herein a promising material for the HDO of biobased molecules [30,31] and show potential as catalysts for cathode materials in Li-air batteries [11,32]. The synergic and promotional effect played by Co when added to Pd based catalysts is studied via CO oxidation probe reactions. Characterization of the catalysts using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was performed to investigate the correlation of the alloy formation and metal segregation during the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments and under CO oxidation reactions. In addition, transmission electron microscopy analysis was conducted to investigate morphological and chemical properties of the active catalysts as well as after catalytic reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst synthesis All reagents were used as received without further purification. Catalysts were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation [7]. Briefly, the acetylacetonate complexes of each metal Pd(acac)2 and Co(acac)2) were dissolved at 70°C in a mixture of 75:2:2 (isopropanol:oleylamine:oleic acid) and were added dropwise to activated carbon (Merck, incipient point of 1.58 mL.g−1) at the same temperature. The solid was dried overnight at 110°C and was subsequently calcined at 300°C for 30 min under a flow of 50 mL.min−1 of 10% O2 with a heating rate of 2°C.min−1. Pd loading was fixed at 2 wt.% on all samples with the Co loading adjusted to the ratios of Co/Pd in mol with the molar fraction (xCo) shown in parenthesis 0.1 (0.09), 0.2 (0.17), 0.5 (0.33), 0.7 (0.41), 1 (0.5), and 2 (0.67). Pd/C and Co/C monometallic counterparts were also synthesized for comparison: Pd loading was set to 2 wt.% and the Co loading was set to be similar to the Co/Pd molar ratio of 1. All catalysts were named as follows: PdaCob/C, in which a and b are the molar fraction of each metal. Then, the synthesized bimetallic samples were coded: Pd0.9Co0.1; Pd0.83Co0.17; Pd0.67Co033; Pd0.59Co0.41; Pd0.5Co0.5; Pd0.33Co0.67. 2.2 Catalytic activity 15 mg of sample was mixed with 95 mg of activated carbon (Merck) and placed into a vertical fixed-bed quartz reactor (10 mm internal diameter) surrounded by a tubular furnace (200 mm in length). A scheme of the experimental setup used for catalytic tests is shown in Fig. 1 . The sample was heated to 450°C at a rate of 5°C.min−1 in a flow of 5% H2/He at 50 mL.min−1 and then held isothermally for 30 min to remove the organic capping agent and to reduce the metallic particles. After cooling to room temperature under helium flow of 50 mL.min−1, the gas stream composition was switched to 1% CO and 1% O2 at 100 mL.min−1 in He. CO oxidation light-off curves were then measured during heating to 300°C at a rate of 2°C.min−1 and again during cooling to room temperature. An online µGC (Agilent 490) equipped with a Molsieve 5A (M5AHBF) and a CP-SIL 5CB (5CBH) column module (each with a thermal conductivity detector) was used to quantify CO and CO2, respectively. The CO conversion (CO%) was calculated from the CO peak areas, see equation (E1). (E1) C O % = [ ( [ C O ] 0 − [ C O ] ( T ) ) / [ C O ] 0 ] · 100 % where: [CO]0 is the blank stream composition and [CO](T) is the composition at each temperature during the reaction. 2.3 Electron microscopy Catalysts were characterized by the acquisition of High Angular Annular Dark Field (HAADF-STEM) and Bright Field STEM (BF-STEM) in an atomic resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher/FEI Titan Themis 80-300 operating at 300 kV) in operation at the LNNano-CNPEM. Preliminary TEM images were taken using a JEOL 2100F microscope operating at 200 kV at the LNNano-CNPEM facility(SI, Fig.S3) The samples were prepared by dropping a sonicated suspension of the catalysts in isopropanol onto 400 carbon-coated copper grids (ultrathin carbon/holey carbon, 400 mesh copper grid, Ted Pella, Inc.), followed by solvent evaporation at room temperature overnight. Compositional maps were acquired by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) image using a Super-X detector at Titan microscope. The same microscopy grids were used for TEM and STEM analysis. 2.4 In situ XRD In situ X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out during temperature-programmed reduction (XRD-TPR) studies at the XPD beamline at the LNLS-Brazil. Samples were placed in an in-house developed furnace, installed on a Huber 5020 diffractometer (4+2 circles), operating in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. The samples were heated at a rate of 5°C.min−1 using a flow of 50 mL.min−1 of a 5%H2/He gas mixture. Diffractograms were continuously acquired during the TPR analysis using a Mythen-1k linear detector installed 1m from the sample. 2.5 In situ XANES In situ XANES measurements were also performed during the TPR experiments (XANES-TPR) at the DXAS beamline at the LNLS-Brazil. Samples were loaded into a quartz capillary (1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.01 mm wall thickness) and were reduced under a flow of 5 mL.min−1 of 5%H2/He at 5°C min−1, using a hot air blower GSB1300 (FMB Oxford), while measuring XANES at the Co K-edge (7.709 keV). The normalized integrated area around the region of the pre-edge peak of the metallic Co (7.705 to 7.720 KeV) was calculated for selected normalized TPR-XANES spectra using the integration tool in OriginPro 8.1 SR3. In situ XANES measurements of the catalysts were also carried out during the CO oxidation reactions. A tubular furnace (LNLS in-house development) in transmission mode was used and the sample was mixed with BN and pressed into a pellet and measured at the Co K-edge (7.709 keV) at the XAFS2 beamline, LNLS. Absorption spectra were analyzed via standard procedures using the DEMETER 0.9.25 package [33]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic testing – CO oxidation Light-off curves, i. e. catalytic activity measured non-isothermally using a heating and cooling ramp, were collected for Pd/C, Co/Pd and bimetallic PdCo samples comprising various Pd/Co molar ratios as shown in Fig. 2. A blank reaction, with only activated carbon, was also measured for comparison. The temperature at which 50% CO conversion occurs is known as the catalyst light-off temperature (T1/2) and is a parameter used to characterize and compare CO conversion among the catalysts [25]. Catalytic results show (Fig. 2 ) that Co-promotion reduced the light-off temperature for the reaction when compared to the monometallic catalyst compositions (Pd/C and Co/C). Moreover, an inverse hysteresis curve is noted in the Co/C light-off curve as well as in the bimetallic sample comprising (Pd0.33Co0.67/C). On the other hand, hysteresis was almost absent with respect to the Pd/C catalyst [25]. A correlation between the light-off temperature (T1/2) and Co molar fraction of the bimetallic catalysts is shown in the SI, Fig. S1. When considering the monometallic catalysts, T1/2 decreases from ≈280 °C for Co/C samples to ≈220 °C for the Pd/C catalyst (Fig. 2a)). Interestingly, the catalytic results suggest there is an optimal Co mol fraction at which T1/2 is minimized which lies between 0.2 and 0.3. Similar results were also obtained by Wu et al. [10] where studies of PdCo nanoparticles with varying Co loadings were measured and characterized using TEM and ambient pressure XPS. The authors showed Co promotion of Pd nanoparticles increased the catalytic activity during CO oxidation reactions and suggested an optimized Co loading. The minimum temperature for 100% conversion of CO was around 110 °C and was reached using a catalyst comprising Co0.26Pd0.74. Based on the experimental analysis, a mechanism was proposed by the authors to explain the dependence of Co-promotion in relation to the PdCo alloy and its effect on CO oxidation. First, Co segregates to the Pd surface during thermal treatment. At lower temperatures (150°C), Pd is completely reduced by CO, but Co remains mostly oxidized. In samples comprising higher Co content (Co0.58Pd0.48), CoOx species cover the Pd surface and inhibit access to the Pd sites thereby hindering catalytic activity. On the other hand, at lower concentrations of Co (Co0.26Pd0.74), the Pd surface remains exposed in addition to the existence of Pd and Co interfaces and boundaries which act as active catalytic sites. On top of the Pd particles, CO is strongly absorbed with O2 showing affinity towards the Co sites. The reagents are now in close proximity to each other and the CO oxidation reaction mechanism is kinetically favourable following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism [10]. Interestingly, in this work, a similar catalytic result was obtained with bimetallic PdCo catalysts. Although it was not possible to derive an exactly optimized Pd/Co molar ratio, the data indicates this value lies between 0.2 and 0.3 (SI, Fig. S1). Further, differing from Wu´s et al`s work [6], where bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized in a well-defined composition with respect to the PdCo alloy stoichiometry and particle size (4.5 ± 0.3 nm), in this work, these two parameters were not prioritized in the synthesis. The strategy was rather aimed at the optimization of Pd and Co contact through single-atom deposition of Co on carbon as will be discussed later by HAADF-STEM analysis. 3.2 Morphological and chemical investigation To investigate the morphology of the catalyst, HAADF-STEM analysis was undertaken on the Pd0.67Co0.33/C sample (Fig. 3 ), after the activation (thermal treatment under 5%H2/He, 400 °C for 30 min) and after the CO oxidation reaction. Fig. 3 (a-c) and (e-g) present STEM images at different magnifications and show particles that are well distributed over the amorphous carbon support. High-resolution images (Fig. 3 (c) and (g)) and their respective Fast Fourier Transform images (Fig. 3 (d) and (h)), reveal crystalline nanoparticles with uniform shape in the activated catalyst and with non-uniform (agglomeration-like) on the catalyst after the catalytic reaction. The metal particle sizes on the catalyst prior to catalytic reaction are not uniform but, in general, are smaller than 10 nm. TEM images illustrating the morphology and distribution of the metallic nanoparticles over the carbon support of different catalysts: Co/C, Pd0.5Co0.5/C, and Pd0.67Co0.33/C can be accessed in the SI (Fig. S3). Fig. 4 shows the elemental mapping of the activated and spent Pd0.67Co0.33/C catalyst acquired via EDS during STEM mapping. Maps exhibiting higher and lower magnification are shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S4). The elemental mapping obtained for the activated sample (Fig. 4 (b-d)) shows an overlapping of the Pd nanoparticles with the highly dispersed Co. The higher molar ratio of Co highlights the contact between the Pd and Co on the bimetallic catalyst. The elemental mapping is shown in SI Fig. S5. Therefore, for the activated catalyst with lower Co loadings (Pd0.67Co0.33/C), the PdCo interactions are less visible but cannot be discarded. The elemental mapping via EDS of the spent Pd0.33Co0.67/C catalyst (Fig. S5(a-e)) reveals that some degree of agglomeration of Co over the Pd nanoparticles takes place after activation. Increased agglomeration of the bimetallic was also noted by HAADF-STEM images for the catalyst after CO oxidation (Fig. 3 (e)-(g)), in comparison with the same catalyst before activation (Fig. 3 (a)-(c)). However, the reduced dispersion and larger bimetallic particles did not affect the catalytic performance, as seen in the light-off curves measured during a second catalytic run (SI, Fig. S2). Fig. 5 shows a high-resolution HAADF image of the activated Pd0.67Co0.33/C catalyst. The simultaneous collection of BF and HAADF micrographs is shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S6). The images also point to the existence of single atoms of Co dispersed on carbon and permeating the Pd nanoparticles [10]. Some of the single atoms are indicated by red arrows for easier visualization due to the lower phase contrast of Co in comparison with Pd nanoparticle. Direct atomic-scale images are difficult to obtain when the substrate is amorphous and/or relatively flat, which is the case of the activated carbon used here. When the support is crystalline, the aberration-corrected HAADF images may show different contrasts of the atomic mass between the support and the single-atom metal. These had been observed by Li et al.[12] in palladium single-atoms in β-FeOOH nanorods and by Lou et al. [15] on gold single-atoms on Co3O4 supports. However, the observation of single atoms on the amorphous carbon support using aberration-corrected STEM operating at 300 kV is challenging due to the high mobility of the atom on the support under electron bombardment as observed in the literature [13,14,16,17]. Further, to examine single atoms, observation at thin regions of the support is required to contrast images in Bright Field and High Angular Annular Dark Field collection modes as shown in Fig. S6. Fortunately, the evidence of single atoms of Co dispersed over the carbon support with nanosized Pd particles was confirmed in Fig. 5 and Fig. S6 from the high-resolution HAADF image. Moreover, a similar image of single atoms of Co being highly dispersed and interacting with the Pd nanoparticle as evidenced in the chemical mapping (Fig. 4 (b-d)) is observed. The incipient impregnation of an optimal proportion of Pd/Co on activated carbon appears to support single atom Co dispersion. Moreover, the synthesis methodology employed via the use of oleyamine and oleaic acid favours highly dispersed nanoparticles of the noble metal over the carbon support decorated with atomic Co and ensures close interaction between Pd and Co. As seen in the STEM images (Fig. 4) Pd agglomerates to a higher degree forming small particles ca. 5 nm in size whereas Co remains atomically distributed over the surface. This indicates an anchoring effect of Co on the activated carbon support attributed to carbons solubility in Co trapping atomic Co on the support surface and inhibiting agglomeration [29]. The subsequent thermal treatment to remove the capping agents and activate both metals acts to improve PdCo alloy formation, which is fundamental to optimize the catalytic activity during CO oxidation reactions as shown in the light-off curves in Fig. 2 a) and b). The convolution of the selected synthesis parameters results in an active PdCo/C catalyst, presenting an optimized Co/Pd ratio around 0.2-0.3 molar percentage (SI, Fig. S1). In addition, the light-off curve obtained for Pd/C catalysts presented an almost absent hysteresis (Fig. 2 a)). On the contrary, a broader and inverse hysteresis was obtained for the PdCo/C catalysts with different Co/Pd molar ratios. The results demonstrate the benefit of depositing Co in a proportion below that of monolayer coverage [6], which creates small active sites on the Pd surface and lead to observed inverse hysteresis. Due to variations in the adsorption strength of CO onto different active sites of the catalyst, the light-off curves may show either inverse or typical hysteresis curves [25]. Inverse hysteresis usually occurs where noble metal nanoparticles are smaller than 2 nm with typical hysteresis noted for larger particles. Here, the PdCo nanoparticles vary in size with some of the distribution above 2 nm. However, Co remains well segregated and highly dispersed even after the thermal activation while also creating localised and well-distributed PdCo interfaces where Co decorates the larger Pd particles which remain stable active sites for CO adsorption and O2 activation even as the catalyst is cycled (SI, Fig. S2). 3.3 Structural and Electronic characterization via in situ experiments In situ XRD data were measured during the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts to investigate the structural evolution of the bimetallic PdCo/C samples during the same thermal treatment used to remove the capping agent and subsequent activation of the catalyst. The XRD pattern obtained at room temperature Fig. 6 a) for Pd/C and Pd0.67Co0.33/C samples show broad peaks around 35° and 43° 2θ, indicating the presence of nanoparticles and amorphous carbon. Contrasting to the sample composed of pure Pd, the sample containing Pd, and Co exhibits a more pronounced and broader peak around 43o 2θ, which is not only assigned to nanosized Pd, but also PdCo alloy formation. The data is in agreement with STEM images as shown in Fig. 4. Diffraction peaks relating to a CoO phase were not detected by XRD due to single atom Co formation which is below the detection limit for XRD but are clearly visible in the HAADF-STEM and EDS images (Fig. 5; Figs. S5 and S6). The XRD patterns collected after the XRD-TPR experiment (Fig. 6b) show sharper, more intense peaks, revealing that migration and sintering of Pd occur during the reduction of the metal under thermal treatment in the monometallic sample. In the case of the bimetallic sample, the diffraction peaks remain broad, with noted peak asymmetry and a significantly larger full width at half maximum (FWHM) indicating smaller nanoparticles. The broadening and peak asymmetry indicate the presence of nanosized Pd and PdCo alloy, respectively. XRD patterns obtained during the TPR experiment are shown in the SI, Fig. S7. The PdO phase is reduced below 100°C, and above 400°C, and the intensity of the Pd(111) peak increases in intensity with a corresponding decrease in the FWHM, indicating agglomeration of the Pd particles. In the case of the bimetallic sample (Pd0.67Co0.33/C), palladium oxide reduction also occurred around 100°C, and above 350°C, the Pd(111) peak shifts to higher 2θ angles, indicating a contraction in the Pd lattice parameter, indicating Co incorporation [34]. XANES analysis at the Co K-edge was also performed under the same conditions as the XRD-TPR. The oxidation state of Co was probed via the examination of the E0 position from the spectra. The XANES profile is related to the chemical environment of the absorbing atoms. Both the Eo position and the profile of the spectra are sensitive to alloy formation [11,34]. A catalyst with an increased Co to Pd molar ratio was studied by XANES (Fig. 7 a) and b)) to improve the Co XANES absorption signal quality. Examining the XANES profile, prior to the TPR (Fig. 7 a)), the spectra of the Co species resemble that of the CoO standard, with the pre-edge features and oscillations being either absent or attenuated. This indicates the presence of randomized species, such as in very small particles lacking long-range structural order. Secondly, after the TPR, at higher temperature, the edge resembles the Co foil standard, but with some differences in the overall profile. The white line intensity is increased with the oscillations above the edge shifted to lower energies. These data indicate that the Co is in a reduced form in this sample. However, its occupied density of states, i. e., the electron density in the metallic bands, differ from the Co foil. Also, the energy shift observed in the oscillations at higher energy, implies that the backscattering pairs are in different positions, i.e., the atoms around the absorber are in different positions to that of a standard Co structure (Co foil). These features are explained via the migration of the Co atoms into the Pd lattice, which lead to the formation of a Pd-Co alloy. This result confirms observations noted in the XRD (Fig. 6) and STEM (Fig. 4) analysis. In situ XANES spectra obtained during the TPR analysis are shown in the SI, Fig. S8. Despite the lower resolution of the Co XANES spectra resulting from the low concentration of Co in the samples, the results corroborate the XRD-TPR results (SI, Fig. S7). In the XANES features (SI, Fig. S8), initial changes are observed below 100°C followed by secondary changes above 350°C for the Co species, indicating Co reduction. The in situ XANES data collected during the CO oxidation reaction (Fig. 8 ) show that Co is slowly oxidized during the reaction until a stable oxide is formed. As oxygen is activated on the Co surface an increase in the oxidation state of the Co is expected. Three different species are formed and further indicate the primary species responsible for the observed catalytic activity. For Co/C and Pd0.5Co0.5/C the profile is similar to the Co2O3 bulk standard, which suggests the formation of a well-defined Co(III) phase. On the other hand, for Pd0.67Co0.33/C, the profile reassembles the CoO standard (Co(II)), which both indicate the stabilization of a reduced oxidation state, likely due to the close proximity of Co to Pd whereby Pd and the reducing nature of CO act to partially reduce the Co from Co(III) to Co(II). The reduction of the Co white line further indicates this feature. Moreover, the attenuation of the XANES oscillations indicates a disorganized phase, such as small particles lacking long-range structural order. These combined results show that Co resides around the surface with close contact to the Pd-NPs. The more reduced species, Co(II), is likely more active and behaves as the O2 activation site that directs the reaction mechanism towards a non-competitive route with CO being activated at Pd sites. This result is in agreement with a meticulous study by Wu et al.[10] showing that Co preferentially segregates to the Pd surface but in proportions below that of total surface coverage over the noble metal´s surface. Finally, the exposed Pd interacts with CO meanwhile Co is oxidized to Co(III) when oxygen is present during the reaction. 4 Conclusions The synthesis methodology, using oleyamine and oleaic acid as capping agents for the optimized delivery of Pd and Co to the activated carbon surface, created single-atom, highly dispersed cobalt and nanosized particles of Pd over the support. Thermal activation of the catalysts, under reductive atmosphere, allowed Pd and Co mobility leading to the formation of a PdCo alloy, according to STEM-EDS, in situ XRD and XANES analysis. The intimate contact between Co and Pd facilitates rapid adsorption of CO onto Pd while maintaining active sites in close proximity, via Co, for oxygen activation. The adsorbed CO and O readily combine due to their proximity leading to reduce light-off temperatures, and therefore, improved catalytic activity via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. Catalytic testing in combination with electron microscopy, in situ XRD and XANES showed molar percentages between 0.2 to 0.3 in Co produced Pd nanoparticles that are partially decorated with Co. These Co/Pd ratios allow for interfaces and boundaries providing favourable catalytic properties where Pd is partially metallic, and Co is oxidized, albeit as Co(II) rather than Co(III). The less oxidized Co species gives improved oxygen activation facilitating improved catalytic performance. The resulting catalyst showed a marked reduction in CO light-off temperatures compared to monometallic formulations.

        "dc:description": "PdCo bimetallic catalysts were synthesized using oleyamine and oleaic acid as capping agents to effectively disperse the metals over activated carbon via incipient impregnation. The synthesis, in conjunction with the carbon support, resulted in single-atom dispersion of Co over the carbon with the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Thermal activation of the catalysts, under a reducing atmosphere, allowed sufficient Pd and Co mobility leading to the formation of a PdCo alloy, according to STEM, in situ XRD and XANES analysis. Furthermore, molar percentages between 0.2 to 0.3 in Co were effective in producing Pd nanoparticles that are partially decorated with Co to produce a highly active catalyst for CO oxidation. The optimized catalyst formulation and synthesis method provide active sites for CO absorption onto Pd while maintaining active sites, in close proximity, for O2 activation via Co. The resulting catalyst showed a marked reduction in CO light-off temperatures compared to the monometallic formulations.",
