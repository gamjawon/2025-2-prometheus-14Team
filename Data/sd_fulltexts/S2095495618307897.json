We have first performed density function theory to propose the edge of Janus MoSSe (EJM) monolayer as a potential catalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction. Our results show that the superficial D-band centers play an important role in nitrogen fixation. The strain effects greatly alter the D-band center, and further change the interaction between the adsorbates and the surface of catalysts.

Keywords Nitrogen fixation Electrocatalysis Janus MoSSe Strain engineering Density function theory 1 Introduction Nitrogen fixation is one of the most attractive conversions in the world because nitrogen is required to biosynthesize basic building blocks of plants, animals, and other life forms [1–4]. The Haber-Bosch process is widely used in industrial production of fertilizers. However, it needs to be realized at high reaction temperatures (400–500 °C) and pressures (200–250 bar) and the use of Fe or Ru catalysts [5,6]. To overcome the inertness of N2 molecules, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identify the feasible catalytic systems for this transformation [7–12]. Electrocatalysts [13–15], photocatalysts [16,17] and purified nitrogenases [18] can be used to activate the N2 molecule and convert the N2 to ammonia at ambient conditions. The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has six protons/electrons reaction processes: N2 + 6H +  + 6e −  → 2NH3. It is well-recognized that the excellent catalyst requires a small activation energy and small adsorption energy for the intermediate species. Strain is one of the most important physical properties for solid materials and widely studied by researchers [19–27]. Strain effects can be used to tune the physical and chemical properties of materials. Recently the strain effects have been introduced to the research of electrocatalysis [26,28–36]. For example, Zheng's group proposed that the formation of strained sulphur vacancies could activate and optimize MoS2 basal planes for hydrogen evolution reaction [33]. Cui's group tuned the strain of Pt nanoparticles using a common Li-ion battery electrode material (LiCoO2) as the support [37]. Huang's group performed PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplates to boost oxygen reduction catalysis [38]. However, the mechanism of strain effects how to adjust the process of NRR is still unclear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to elucidate the effects of strain for NRR and realize high intrinsic NRR activity. It is well-known that the D-band center model has played a crucial role in the adsorption ability and reaction activation energy [39–41]. It is one of the indicators to evaluate the catalytic effect [42–47]. Specifically, the effect of strain on the reactivity of the surface of catalyst can induce a shift in the metal D-band center. For the late transition metals (more than half filled d band), the tensile strain upshifts the D-band center, whereas comprehensive strain downshifts the D-band center [40]. The closer the D-band center of catalytic surface to the Fermi level, the stronger interaction with adsorbates; because the lower occupation of antibonding states in the surface-adsorbates enhances the interaction strength. The Janus MoSSe with symmetry breaking in the out-of-plane has been synthesized by Lu et al. in 2017 [48]. It has attracted increasing attention due to some unique properties such as out of plane piezoelectricity and vertical dipole. Interestingly, the Janus MoSSe also has the similar physical and chemical properties as the conventional MoS2, which has attracted significant attention due to its good hydrodesulphurization, hydrogen evolution reaction, and carbon dioxide or oxygen reduction reaction. Moreover, it is exciting that the edge of MoS2 could catalyze the conversion of N2 to NH3 [49]. Herein, we firstly performed density functional theory to elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen fixation at the edge of MoSSe. We identified that the strain effects of the edge of MoSSe were the cause for the nitrogen fixation. 2 Computational methods Theoretical calculations were based on the density functional theory (DFT) methods by using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code on the basis of the plane-wave pseudopotential. The plane-wave cut-off energy was set to 350 eV. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional for generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [50] was employed to optimize all the geometric structures. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a Monkhorst-Pack 5 × 5 × 1 K-point grid [51]. The process of geometry optimization approached the electronic ground state when the energy and force on each ion were reduced below 10-5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å. To optimize the MoSSe model, we first built a periodic supercell (3 × 3) containing 9 Mo, 9 S and 9 Se atoms with a vacuum of 15 Å in the z-direction. The edge model of Janus MoSSe (EJM) was established by six layer atoms thickness with a vacuum of 15 Å in the z-direction, and the bottom two layers were fixed as the bulk structure. The adsorption energy (E ad) was defined as follows: E ad = E MoSSe + N 2 − E MoSSe − E N 2 where E MoSSe + N 2 , E MoSSe, and E N 2 are the total energies of MoSSe with adsorbate (N2), a clean surface of MoSSe, and the isolated adsorbate of N2 respectively. 3 Results and discussion To reveal the various applications of the Janus MoSSe, we calculated the structural parameters and discussed in detail. The Janus MoSSe monolayer presented a sandwich structure between Mo plane and S and/or Se layers (Fig. 1 a and b), which is similar to the MoS2 or MoSe2 monolayer. Moreover, we also found that the covalent bonding of Mo atomic layer with S or Se atomic layers by using the electron localization function (ELF). It is well-known that the ELF has value between 0 and 1, where the 0.5 and 1 correspond to electron-gas-like pair probability and the perfect localization, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the isovalue of ELF was 0.65, indicative of the covalent bonding of Mo atoms with S and Se atoms. The optimized lattice constants of the MoSSe monolayer were a = b = 3.24 Å, and the bond lengths of Mo–S and Mo–Se were 2.42 and 2.51 Å, respectively. Compared with the MoS2 (3.17 Å) and MoSe2 (3.29 Å), the relevant parameters of Janus MoSSe were in the middle between MoS2 and MoSe2, which suggests the reasonable geometry optimization for the Janus MoSSe [48]. To elucidate the natural electronic structure of Janus MoSSe, we firstly calculated the band structure and found that it was a direct-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.55 eV and located at the K point of the Brillouin zone (Fig. 2 a). It is clear that the band-gap was underestimated about 50% by using the PBE-GGA method. The measured band-gap was about 2.30 eV, which is in agreement with the theoretical analysis. It is noteworthy that the intrinsic dipole in Janus MoSSe can lead to special distribution of the frontier orbitals. As shown in Fig. 2(b and c), the valence band maximum (VBM) was mainly located around Mo and S atoms, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) was occupied by Mo, S and Se atomic orbitals. These electronic properties also can be evidenced by the density of states (DOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS), as shown in Fig. 2(d). It can be found that both the Mo 3d orbitals and S 3p orbitals were located at the Fermi level, but the orbitals of Se did not contributed to the VBM, which is in agreement with the orbitals charge density distribution (Fig. 2b). However, the orbitals of Se 4p were contributed to the CBM, as well as Mo 4d and S 3p orbitals. We have investigated the typical edge structure of Janus MoSSe, which has potential active sites in the Mo terminate layer to catalyze the nitrogen into ammonia at ambient environment. To study the tensile strains effect for nitrogen fixation process, we firstly threw the strains through increasing the lattice constants along the y direction of MoSSe (Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3(b) shows the linear variation of lattice constants under the uniaxial stress from 0% (6.366 Å) to +6% (6.748 Å) along the y direction. Additionally, the superficial bond lengths of Mo–S and Mo–Se are shown in Fig. 3(c). It is clear that the bond length of Mo-Se was higher than that of Mo-S, which is due to the different configurations of extra-nuclear electron. The valence electron of Se (4s 24p 4) is more delocalized than the S (3s 23p 4) valence shell, resulting in longer bond length of Mo–Se. Moreover, it can be found that the Mo–Se bond was more sensitive than the Mo–S bond under the uniaxial strains. The catalytic activity as a function of the strain can be explained by the D-band center model. According to the D-band model, the early transition metals (less than half-filled d band) with tensile lattice strain cause the weaker interaction with adsorbates, whereas compression strain enhances the interaction. For the late transition metals, however, tensile strain upshifts the D-band center for enhanced interaction with adsorbates, whereas compression strain downshifts the D-band center weakening the interaction. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the tensile strain narrows the d band due to the reduced overlap of the wave functions. For an early transition metal, the population of the d band is decreased. In order to preserve the D-band filling, the d band downshifts to maintain the charge distribution. On the contrary, the band narrowing leads to an increased population of the d band of the late transition metal, and the d band upshifts to protect its degree of d band filling. Therefore, under the tensile strain, the intensive interfacial interaction can be seen in the interface between the Mo metal and adsorbates. To further reveal the influence of D-band center on the surface of bulk-like layer of EJM, we calculated the D-band center of K-MoSSe, L-MoSSe, M-MoSSe for superficial layer (first layer) and second layer and bottom layer, respectively. The A-MoSSe represented the whole D-band center of the EJM, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). As shown in Fig. 5(b), a linear relationship between the D-band center and tensile strain was indicated. It is suggested that the tensile strains can upshift the D-band center to the Fermi level and then enhance the EJM-adsorbates interaction. Interestingly, it is clear that the K layer has the highest D-band center, which is closed to the Fermi level, suggesting that the surface of EJM has the strongest interaction with the adsorbates than the L and M layer. This is because the low-lying coordination of the surface Mo atoms, which have only four ligating atoms as compared to the sublayer of EJM. Actually, the filling of the d band is similar to each layer of EMJ, thus the narrowing of the K layer D-band center upshifts to the Fermi level and then enhances the interaction. Additionally, the whole D-band center of EJM (A-EJM) is located between the L and M layer. We can draw the conclusion that surface effects have the nonnegligible role in the D-band model. This finding will direct us to design an appropriate catalyst to catalyze the adsorbates through decreasing the thickness of the catalyst to exposure of the D-band center. The inertness of N2 molecule limits the converting of the abound nitrogen into ammonia. It is well recognized that the adsorption of nitrogen, the first step of the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction, played an important role in the conversion process. Moreover, after the N2 was adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface, the following reaction processes could be performed at ambient temperature. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the tensile strains enhanced the adsorption ability of the EJM for the N2 molecule. It is clear that upshifting the D-band center can improve the superficial interaction. To investigate the influence of adsorbates on the surface of EJM, the surface v-band center was calculated, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). It is clear that the surface D-band center (K-EJM) downshifted a lot after the absorption of N2. For example, the D-band center downshifted to 0.055 eV without the lattice strain. It is implied that the catalyst could be deactivated after absorbing the N2 molecule. Further, the fraction of coverage has been taken into account to reveal the effects of nitrogen molecule on the surface of EJM, as shown in Fig. 6(b). It is found that there is a linear relationship between the surface fraction of coverage and D-band center. The higher fraction of coverage and lower D-band center in the N2 contact patterns lower the adsorption ability of N2. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have firstly performed density function theory to propose a new insight into the design of transition-metal chalcogenide catalysts for NRR. The superficial D-band center at the edge of Janus MoSSe played an important role in nitrogen fixation. Moreover, it was found that the D-band center could be affected by the surface to bulk of catalyst and thus changed the interaction between the adsorbates and the catalyst. This work reveals that the tuning of D-band center may be a reasonable method to screen feasible catalysts for nitrogen fixation.
