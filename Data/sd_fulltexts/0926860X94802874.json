The main products were methacrylonitrile, acetone, and carbon oxides with a small amount of cyanic acid. The selectivities to methacrylonitrile were about 70 tool- % at an isobutyronitrile conversion of around 85% in the presence water vapor. On the other hand, in the absence of water vapor, the selectivity reached 80 tool-% and a marked amount of carbon deposit was observed, though the activity was relatively stable. The activity of a fresh catalyst consisting of only Fe 3+ ions is low, but it increases with an increase in the time-on-stream up to about 10 h and then levels off with a further increase. It was also found that the selectivity to methacrylonitrile increases at the expense of a decrease in acetone, as the reaction temperature rises. The variations in the structures and valence states of iron ions due to the use in the reaction and their effects on the catalytic performances were also studied.

Introduction Catalysts based on iron phosphates are known in patents to be effective as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid, much as heteropoly compounds based on 12-molybdophosphoric acid [ H3PMo12040]. There have been several scientific reports in this connection [ 1-7 ]. Further, it was recently found that iron phosphates are effective as catalysts for oxidative dehy- drogenation of isobutyraldehyde to form methacrolein [methacrylaldehyde; 2- *Corresponding author.

It was therefore concluded that iron phosphates are favorable only for the oxidative dehydrogenation of compounds in which the carbon atom at the a-position of an electron-attracting group such as -COOH and -CHO is tertiary. This led us to expect that iron phosphates are also effective for oxidative dehydro- genation of isobutyronitrile [IBN] to form methacrylonitrile [MAN]: (CH3) 2 CHCN + 0.5 O2 ---> CH2 =C (CH 3) CN -k- He O MAN is an important raw material for useful polymers. It is produced by an ammoxidation of isobutene using Bi-Mo-based multicomponent metal oxides as catalysts. IBN is usually obtained by a hydrogenation of MAN. However, in recent years the demand for isobutene is expected to grow markedly, because a large amount of isobutene is consumed for production of methyl tertiary butyl ether that is used as a gasoline additive. On the other hand, IBN is obtained relatively easily by an addition of cyanic acid to propene; CH3 - CH=CH2 + HCN ---> (CH3)2CHCN Therefore, when the supply of isobutene becomes difficult, the oxidative dehydro- genation of IBN to MAN would come into view. In this work, we attempted to study the oxidative dehydrogenation of IBN to MAN using an iron phosphate catalyst that showed a good performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid [ 5,8 ], and to obtain more information on the catalytic actions of iron phosphate. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst An iron phosphate with a P/Fe atomic ratio of 1.2 was prepared according to the following procedures. Iron nitrate [Fe(NO3)3\" 9H20] (122 g; 0.3 mol) was dis- solved in about 5 1 of water and a dilute ammonia solution was added to precipitate iron hydroxide gel. The precipitate was filtered and the obtained wet gel was mixed with a solution containing 41.5 g of 85% orthophosphoric acid [H3PO4] and 9.0 g of colloidal silica 'Snowtex O' (Nissan Chem. Co.) containing 20% of silica. The mixture was then slowly boiled for 1 to 2 h, yielding a slightly brownish white precipitate. Excess water was evaporated by means of a hot air current; the paste- like compound obtained was dried in an oven at 120 for 6 h. The resulting solid was broken up and sieved to a 7-20-mesh size. Finally, it was calcined in a stream of air at 550 for 4 h. The content of silica in the catalyst was about 3.3%. The catalyst had a BET surface area of 15 m2/g. E. Muneyama et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 165-177 2.2. Reaction procedures The reaction was carried out with a continuous-flow system at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was made of a stainless steel tube, 50 cm long and 1.8 cm I.D., mounted vertically and immersed in a lead bath. The catalyst was placed near the bottom of the reactor and porcelain cylinders, 3 mm long and 1.5 mm I.D./3.0 mm O.D., were placed both under and above the catalyst bed. A mixture of nitrogen and oxygen was fed in from the top of the reactor; IBN and water were introduced into the preheating section of the reactor by means of two injection syringe pumps. Unless indicated otherwise, the feed rates of IBN, oxygen, water, and nitrogen were 31.4, 24.6, 625, and 350 mmol/h, respectively, and the reaction temperature was 480. The other procedures were the same as those described in the previous studies [ 5-10]. The definitions of contact time, conversion, yield, and selectivity were similar to those in a previous study [6]. 2.3. Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray powder diffraction patterns were studied using a Rigaku-Denki, model RAD-RB diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Chemical analysis of the Fee +/(Fee + + Fe 3 +) ratio The amounts of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions in the bulk of the catalyst samples were determined by the redox titration method [ 11 ]. The detailed procedures were described in the previous paper [6]. 3. Results 3.1. Activity of fresh (non-reduced) iron phosphate catalyst The gaseous reaction-feed described in Section 2.2. was passed over a 1.0 g portion of freshly calcined (non-reduced) iron phosphate catalyst; the contact time was about 0.2 s. The main products were MAN, acetone, carbon oxides (COx), and small amounts of cyanic acid. The Fe 2 + / (Fe 2 + + Fe 3 + ) ratio, conversion of IBN, and selectivity to MAN are plotted as a function of the time-on-stream in Fig. 1. The Fe z + / (Fe 2 + + Fe 3 + ) ratio increases as the time-on-stream increases, though the rate is slow, that is, the fresh catalyst is slowly reduced during use in the oxidation of IBN. The activity increases with an increase in the time-on-stream up to about 10 h and levels off with a further increase in the time. On the other hand, the selectivity to MAN is scarcely affected with the variations in the time-on-stream and valence states of iron ions. E.

Activity of reduced iron phosphate catalyst The gaseous reaction-feed was passed over a 1.0 g portion of catalyst that had previously been reduced in hydrogen at 480 for 8 h. The variations in the Fe 2 / (Fe 2+ + Fe 3+ ) ratio, conversion of IBN, and selectivity to MAN are shown as a function of the time-on-stream in Fig. 2. As the time-on-stream increases, the Fe 2 + / (Fe 2+ +Fe 3 ratio decreases gradually; after 7 h on stream, it decreases from 0.95 to 0.72. This indicates that the reduced catalyst is reoxidized during use in the oxidation of IBN. On the other hand, both the activity and selectivity to MAN increase, to a very small extent, with an increase in the time-on-stream. It should be noted that the levels of activity and selectivity of the reduced catalyst are almost the same as those obtained with the fresh (non-reduced) catalyst that was used in the reaction for more than 10 h (Fig. 1 ). It is clear that the activity is stable under the conditions used and that the activity and selectivity are scarcely affected with variations in valence states of iron ions in the bulk.

Product distributions in the reaction over reduced iron phosphate catalyst The gaseous reaction-feed was passed over 0.25 to 2.0 g portions of iron phos- phate catalyst that had previously been reduced by hydrogen at 480 for 8 h [the Fe2+/(Fe2+ +Fe 3+) ratio of 0.95]. The conversion of IBN, yields of MAN, acetone, CO~, and loss, and selectivity to MAN are summarized in Table 1. It is found that the selectivity to MAN increases with an increase in the conversion of IBN up to 85%; it is about 70 mol-% at a conversion from 75 to 85%. The main by-product is acetone; the selectivity to acetone is about 17 to 20 mol-%. 3.4. Effect of temperature on the reaction over reduced catalyst The reaction was conducted at 400, 440, and 480 with different contact times of from 0.04 to 0.8 s. The obtained IBN conversions are plotted as a function of the contact time in Fig. 3. It was found that the effect of temperature on the reaction rate is relatively small; the apparent activation energy that was calculated from the initial rates, was about 12 kcal/mol (50 kJ/mol). 100 T 480 ~c 60 .9 t- o U 20 o-, , , , , ' ' ' o 0.2 0.~ 0.6 0.8 Contact time / s Fig, 3.

Fig. 4 shows the selectivities to MAN, acetone, and COx at 400, 440, and 480 as a function of the IBN conversion. It is clear that the selectivity to MAN increases at the expense of a decrease in that to acetone, as the reaction temperature rises. However, the effect on the selectivity to COx is small. It is therefore concluded that a high temperature of about 480 is favorable for production of MAN. 3.5. Effect of oxygen feed rate A series of experiments was conducted over the reduced catalyst with a contact time of 0.4 s by fixing the feed rates of IBN, water, and nitrogen at 31.4, 625, and 350 mmol/h, respectively, while changing the feed rate of oxygen from 20.5 to 32.0 mmol/h; the oxygen/IBN molar ratio of 0.65 to 1.01. The results are sum- marized in Table 2. As the oxygen feed rate increases, the extent oflBN conversion increases; this suggests that the extent of reaction is limited by a lack in oxygen. However the yield of MAN levels off; that is, the selectivity decreases with an increase in the conversion above 85%. 3.6. Reaction in the absence of oxygen over reduced iron phosphate catalyst The gaseous reaction-feed without oxygen was passed over a 1.0 g portion of the reduced iron phosphate catalyst; the feed rates of IBN, water, and nitrogen were 31.4, 625, and 350 mmol/h, respectively, (contact time of about 0.2 s). The products were only carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide; their yields were 2-3 and 1.5-1.7 mol-%, respectively and remained constant for about 10 h. E.

Reaction in the absence of oxygen over fresh catalyst The gaseous reaction-feed without oxygen was passed over 3 g portions of the freshly calcined (non-reduced) iron phosphate catalyst (the contact time was 0.6 s) and the variations in the Fe2+/(Fe 2+ +Fe 3+) ratio, conversion of IBN, and yields of MAN, acetone, and COx are plotted as a function of the time-on-stream in Fig. 5. The fresh catalyst is reduced much more rapidly by IBN in the absence of oxygen than in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 1); after about 30 min on stream, about 75 % of Fe 3 + was reduced to Fe 2 (Fig. 5). The yields of oxidation products such as MAN and acetone decrease sharply as the time-on-stream increases, while that of COx increases. As a result, after about 2 h on stream, the main portion of IBN is consumed to form only COx. 6O LO b \"~.0 p .... .e ........... 0.8 -o /-'--9' c 20 O.t, ,.~ ! 0 .~- '~-'3 ' ' ~----~ 0 0 ~ 2 3 Time-on-stream I h Fig. 5.

Conditions for IBN oxidation and symbols as in Fig. 1. 3.8. Effect of pre-reduction of fresh catalyst In the previous sections, it was found that the reduced catalyst is much more active than the fresh (non-reduced) catalyst. Therefore, an attempt was made to study the influence of pre-reduction performed for fresh catalyst with IBN in the absence of oxygen. Fig. 6 shows the Fe 2 / (Fe 3 + + Fe 2 ) ratio, conversion of IBN, and selectivity to MAN, which were obtained after about 1.5 h of use in the reaction, as a function of the time of pre-reduction. It is found that the fresh catalyst is clearly reduced and its activity is markedly enhanced by a very short time (1-2 min) of pre-reduction. 3.9. Reaction in the absence of water The oxidation of IBN was performed in the absence of water over 0.25 to 3.0 g portions of the reduced catalyst, the feed rates of IBN, oxygen, and nitrogen were 31.4, 24.6, and 350 mmol/h, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 3. It was found that the selectivities to MAN (about 80 mol-%) and COx are higher, but that to acetone is lower, than those obtained in the presence of water (Table Table 3 Oxidation of IBN in the absence of water over reduced iron phosphate Catalyst used Contact time Conv. of IBN Yield (mol-%) of Selectivity to MAN (g) (s) (%) (tool-%) MAN Acetone COx loss 0.25 0.13 49.7 36.3 2.3 7.6 3.5 73 0.5 0.26 68.0 53.0 2.8 12.3 0.0 78 1.0 0.52 78.0 61.4 2.5 14.5 0.0 79 2.0 1.04 85.7 62.1 2.9 15.1 5.6 80 Feed rates, IBN/oxygen/nitrogen = 31.4/31.9/350 mmol/h. E. Muneyama et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 165-177 1 ). It should also be noted that a marked amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst was observed in the elementary analysis of the used catalysts. However, no clear change in the activity was observed during 15 h of use in the reaction. 3.10. Variation in the structure during use in the reaction Fig. 7 shows the XRD spectra of the iron phosphate samples that were reduced, to different extent, with IBN in the absence of oxygen, [Section 3.7. (Fig. 5)]. The reduction times for spectra A, B, C, and D are 0, 7.5, 15, and 180 min, respectively. The figures denote the FEE+/(Fe 2+ + Fe 3+ ) ratios. The fresh (non- reduced) sample (spectrum A) consists of an FePO4 phase and an unidentified phase characterized with three peaks at 20 = 20.00 20.95 and 22.50 (this phase is designated hereafter as X-phase). With an increase in the extent of reduction, the X-phase disappears first and two new phases appear; the one is characterized with peaks at 20 = 19.96 21.24 35.04 35.54 50.68 (this phase is designated hereafter as B-phase), and the other is characterized with a peak at 20 = 29.5 (this phase is designated hereafter as Y-phase). The FePO4 phase is then trans- formed to the two new phases. With a further increase in the extent of reduction, these two new phases are also transformed to the FeaP207 phase [ 12] (spectrum D).

(B) is the spectrum of a sample obtained by reoxidation of the reduced sample with air at 480 for 12 h. The samples consist of only Y-phase. (C) is the spectrum of a reduced sample used in the oxidation of IBN for 7 h. The sample consists of Y-phase with a small amount of Fe2P207 . It is found that the Fe2P207 phase is reoxidized with oxygen to the Y-phase, but not to FePO 4, the X-phase, or the B-phase. 4. Discussion For comparison purposes, the performances of the iron phosphate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid obtained in our previous works [ 7,13] are summarized in Table 4. It was found from the present study that iron phosphate shows a high selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of IBN to MAN. However, the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation of IBN is clearly slower than that observed in the oxidation of isobutyric acid [ 5-7 ]. As a result, a high temperature of around 480 is required to achieve a high IBN conversion (Fig. 3). This difference in reactivities may be related to the difference of the -CN group from the -COOH group in electron-attracting properties that is associated with the H-C bond strength at the a-position. The main side reaction is the formation of acetone, much as in the case of oxidation of isobutyric acid [ 1,4,6 ]. Acetone may be formed in parallel with MAN as in the oxidation of isobutyric acid. It is likely that cyanic acid is accompanied Table 4 Catalytic performances of iron phosphate in the oxidation of isobutyric acid Catalyst Feed rate (mmol/h) Contacttime IBAconv.

The scheme for the main reactions is considered to be as shown in Fig. 10. As shown in Fig. 4, as the reaction temperature rises, the selectivity to MAN increases at the expense of a decrease in acetone, though the effect of temperature on the selectivity is small in the oxidation of isobutyric acid [ 1 ]. This suggests that the activation energy for the formation of MAN is higher than that for the formation of acetone. It was also found that the extent of the reaction, that is, the conversion of IBA, is almost of the same level regardless of the presence or absence of water vapor in the reaction feed (Tables 1 and 3); however, in the case of oxidation of isobutyric acid the catalytic activity falls markedly as the feed rate of water decreases [ 1,4]. Further, the activity for the oxidation of IBN in the absence of water vapor scarcely decreases with an increase in the time-on-stream, while the activity for the oxidation of isobutyric acid falls markedly. It should also be noted that higher selectivities to MAN and lower selectivities to acetone are obtained when the oxidation is per- formed in the absence of water vapor. The action of water vapor in the reaction of IBN seems to be different from that in the reaction of isobutyric acid; the presence of water vapor is not indispensable for the oxidation of IBN, unlike for the oxidation of isobutyric acid. This may in part be due to the reaction temperature; the affinity of oxygenated products to the catalyst is weak in the oxidation of IBN because the oxidation of IBN is performed at a temperature as high as 480, and as a result, the products are removed relatively easily. While in the oxidation of isobutyric acid the affinity is strong because the temperature is lower, and as a result, the products are removed with the aid of water vapor. A clear deposition of carbon on the catalyst was observed in the reactions of both IBN and isobutyric acid, when they were performed in the absence of water vapor. This finding may suggest that water vapor plays a role in removing the oxygenated products from the surface and, as a result, in suppressing the deposit of carbon. However, the extent of carbon deposit is much greater in the oxidation of isobutyric acid than in the oxidation of IBN. The products obtained in the reaction of IBN performed over reduced catalyst in the absence of oxygen were only COx (Section 3.6. ). The products obtained in the reaction of IBN performed over fresh catalysts in the absence of oxygen after about 10 h of use were also only COx (Section, 3.7.; Fig. 5). These findings suggest that COx is formed not by an oxidation of IBN, but by a 'water-gas-shift-type reaction' between carbon and water; C + xH20 -'~ COx q-xH2. It should also be noted that this 'water-gas-shift-type reaction' is promoted by only reduced iron phosphates, but not by non-reduced catalysts. The fresh iron phosphates consisting of Fe 3 + ions are reduced by IBN at 480 to Fe2P207 via the B-phase much as they are reduced by isobutyric acid at 400 E. Muneyama et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 165-177 [7], and the obtained Fe2P20 7 is reoxidized by oxygen to the Y-phase. During the use in the oxidation of IBN, a part of the fresh catalyst is also reduced to the B- phase and a part of the catalyst consisting of Fe2P20 7 is reoxidized to the Y-phase, though both rates are slow. It was found that the catalysts containing B-phase, Y-phase, and/or FeEP207 show the same levels of activity, but that the fresh catalysts consisting of FePO4 and/or the X-phase are clearly lees active than those containing B-phase, Y-phase, and/or FeEP207 phase. This may suggest that the active sites are related to the presence of B-phase, Y-phase, and/or FeEP20 7 phases, but not to FePO4 or X-phase. In the oxidation of isobutyric acid, reduced catalysts consisting of the Fe2P20 7 phase showed almost the same level of activity as that of fresh (non-reduced) catalysts consisting of FePO 4 and/or X-phase [ 7 ]. Indeed, the B-phase is promptly formed from the fresh catalyst during the oxidation of isobutyric acid, while it is formed very slowly during the oxidation of IBN. Possibly, the reducing properties of IBN may be much lower than those of isobutyric acid. It seems hard to fully explain the obtained experimental results from the infor- mation about the bulk of catalyst such as valence states of iron ions and structure. Further information about the surface properties seems to be needed. At this stage, it is likely that surface species which promote the oxidation of IBN are formed on the B-phase, the Y-phase and/or the Fe2P207 phase, but not on the FePO4 and/or X-phase.

Tel. (+81-45) 9245271, fax. (+81-45) 9245276. The oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyronitrile was studied using an iron phosphate with a P/Fe atomic ratio of 1.2 as the catalyst. The main products were methacrylonitrile, acetone, and carbon oxides with a small amount of cyanic acid. The selectivities to methacrylonitrile were about 70 mol-% at an isobutyronitrile conversion of around 85% in the presence water vapor. On the other hand, in the absence of water vapor, the selectivity reached 80 mol-% and a marked amount of carbon deposit was observed, though the activity was relatively stable. The activity of a fresh catalyst consisting of only Fe3+ ions is low, but it increases with an increase in the time-on-stream up to about 10 h and then levels off with a further increase. It was also found that the selectivity to methacrylonitrile increases at the expense of a decrease in acetone, as the reaction temperature rises. The variations in the structures and valence states of iron ions due to the use in the reaction and their effects on the catalytic performances were also studied.
