Graphical abstract Fumed silica was modified with octadecyl groups at different Cl:OH ratios (0:100, 20:80, 50:50 and 80:20) and used as support to immobilize an FI Ti-based catalyst. The supported catalysts were evaluated for ethylene polymerization and the effects of the organic ligands on the surface of the support, and the polymerization temperature in the reaction medium was examined. The resulting polymers have molecular weights higher than 1 million gmol−1, which is typical of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The organic group appears to act as a modifier (horizontal spacer) around the active sites, thus affecting the activity and kinetics of the catalyst. Keywords Fumed silica octadecyl ligand FI catalysts UHMWPE 1 INTRODUCTION Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a polyolefin with a molecular weight (Mw) higher than one million gmol−1 and is characterized by superior properties such as high impact viscosity, increased wear resistance, low friction, slide and adhesion coefficients, and high chemical stability [1–4]. Since the middle of the 1990s, Fujita and co-workers have synthesized phenoxy-imine based catalysts for olefin polymerization combined with early transitional metal complexes, known as FI catalysts [5]. These catalysts can produce polymers of variable structure, from linear crystalline to highly branched amorphous polymers, and are very versatile due to their functional groups. Furthermore, these catalysts can be highly active, acting as single-site systems, in the presence of a broad range of co-catalysts [5,6]. In particular, for ethylene polymerization, FI catalysts are known for their high activity and good performance when used under mild reaction conditions [7,8]. These features motivated us to use this type of catalyst in our study to produce UHMWPE. From the processing perspective, low temperature polymerization conditions induce a high molecular weight in and fast crystallization of polymer chains [9]. The nature of the catalyst and the reaction polymerization conditions are mandatory for obtaining UHMWPE. From the catalyst perspective, production of this polyolefin has been achieved by a variety of approaches such as controlling the monomer pressure and the reaction time of the homogeneous FI catalyst [10], modifying the substituent on the N-aryl group of these catalysts [11], modifying the supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts using magnesium ethoxide and graphene oxide as catalyst supports [12], producing blends with a variable content of UHMWPE using dual-site catalyst systems supported on functionalized grapheme[13], or supporting the Fe/Cr catalyst with silica [14]. To overcome the issues caused by homogeneous polymerization, such as reactor fouling and the lack of polymer morphology control, a broad range of different materials such as polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanocomposites [2,15], MgCl2 [16] and latex particles[17] have been used as supports for the immobilization of FI catalysts. However, to the best of our knowledge, organomodified silica has not been used to support FI catalysts. From the surface perspective, the modification of a silica surface with an organic functional group has been exploited in the case of supported metallocenes. For instance, Greco et al. modified the support with ligands that were used as horizontal spacers to avoid catalyst bimolecular deactivation [18], and Casas et al. modified a silica support with sulfonic groups to achieve higher catalyst activity due to the increased acidity on the support surface [19]. Several approaches have been used to modify the silica surface with ligands to create active species spaced apart from each other and farther from the support surface or to tune the acidity on the catalyst metal centre. The goal of the present research is to evaluate the feasibility of the production of UHMWPEs by modifying the surface of a commercial silica support (fumed silica) with chloro(dimethyl)octadecylsilane followed by treatment with methylaluminoxane (MAO) prior to the grafting of an FI catalyst on the surface. This organic insertion on the silica surface creates a very isolated catalytically active site, spaced through the organic groups, which can act directly on the final polymer molecular weight and improves catalyst activity [2]. 2 EXPERIMENTAL 2.1 Materials Bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoranilinato]titanium(IV) dichloride (FI catalysts) was kindly provided by the LSP group and was previously synthesized following the Fujita group’s protocol [20]. Fumed silica (395m2 g−1, 0.007μm particle size), chloro(dimethyl)octadecylsilane (95%), and triisobutylaluminum (TIBA, 1M) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Methylaluminoxane (MAO, 10wt% solution in toluene) was purchased from Chemtura – AXION®. Toluene (99.9%) and heptane (95%) were purchased from ROMIL – SpS and purified using an MB SPS-800 solvent purification system prior to use. Ethylene (2.5 grade) was purchased from Rivoira and purified by passage through activated-Cu/A4 molecular sieves in mixed bed columns. All manipulations were performed under argon or nitrogen atmospheres using an Mbraum MB200MOD glove box. Silica modification and FI catalyst immobilization procedures were conducted in a glove box equipped with a Symix XCM (core module) platform specially designed for organic synthesis. Polymerization reactions were performed using a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) made by Symix Technologies, currently Freeslate. 2.2 Silica surface modification The received fumed silica was subjected to a thermal treatment using a silicone bath at 110°C under a vacuum for 15h prior to insertion into the glove box. The amount of hydroxyl groups (OH) on the silica surface is reported in the literature by different authors, experimentally and through theoretical models, relating values in a range of 4.5–4.6OHnm−2 [21]. Therefore, in this work, the amount of hydroxyl groups on silica surface was estimated as approximately 4.6OHnm−2, based on the data reported in the literature relating the silica thermal treatment temperature and OH number [21,22]. All reactions were performed in a glove box using 4mL vials for the support modification. In a typical preparation, a mass of silica corresponding to 288μmol of OH was weighed and suspended in 2mL of toluene. Then, a mass of chloro(dimethyl)octadecylsilane (Cl-ODS), corresponding to the different Cl:OH ratios, was also suspended in toluene and added to the vials containing the silica suspension. All vials were filled with toluene until a total volume of 3mL was attained and stirred for 16h at 70°C using a magnetic stirrer. Then, the suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the resultant solid was washed with 3 aliquots of 2mL of toluene. The investigated Cl:OH ratios (considering the Cl from the silane and the OH from the silica surface) used for the surface modification reactions were 0, 2, 20, 50 and 80. The resulting catalysts were labelled with the initials of fumed silica (FS) followed by the proportion of Cl from the organosilane. For instance, FS50 represents a silica produced by the surface reaction corresponding to a Cl:OH ratio of 50:50. 2.3 Catalyst immobilization Hereafter, the abbreviation FI will be used for the catalyst bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoranilinato]titanium(IV) dichloride for the sake of clarity. The organosilane-modified silica was treated with an MAO solution (corresponding to 10wt%. All considering the total amount of initially weighed SiO2) and stirred for 2h at 50°C followed by centrifugation. After removing the supernatant, the solid was washed with 3 aliquots of 2mL of toluene and further reacted with a titanium complex solution (corresponding to 0.5wt% of Ti/SiO2) in toluene for 30min under magnetic stirring at room temperature. The centrifugation and solid washing steps were repeated with an additional step of washing with 1-heptane followed by drying the immobilized catalyst under vacuum for 12h. 2.4 Polymerization The synthesized catalysts were tested for ethylene polymerization by applying the high-throughput technique using the parallel pressure reactors (PPR) from Freeslate. The PPR comprises 48 single reactor cells arranged in a 6 (columns)×8 (rows) matrix with an internal volume of approximately 16mL. The reactors were equipped with glass inserts of approximately 6mL that correspond to the internal working volume of the polymerization reaction. Each column module has a heating system to control the temperature of each cell that in turn contains an individual pressure control and magnetic stirrers. TIBA was used as both the scavenger and co-catalyst, and heptane was used as the solvent. The temperature ranged from 50 to 70°C under the ethylene pressure of 8.3bar. Prior to the insertion of the catalyst suspension into the reactors, sonication of the supported catalysts for 2min was necessary to guarantee a better dispersal within the reactors. 2.5 Catalyst and polymer characterization Small-angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments were carried on the D11A beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). The scattering data were collected at a wavelength λ=1,488nm at distances of 491mm and 1605mm. The samples were fixed between two Kapton® windows, and the collimated X-ray beam was passed through a chamber containing the stainless steel sample holder. SAXS data analysis was performed using the Irena evaluation routine implemented in the Igor Pro Software (WaveMetrics, Portland, USA) [23]. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu FTIR spectrophotometer model 8300 (32 scans with a resolution of 4cm−1). The synthesized silica samples were analysed as pellets with a thickness and a diameter of approximately 2mm and 5mm, respectively. Sample mass dilution was performed with KBr. Grafted Ti content on the modified support was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES) using an Agilent 710 setup. The samples were previously digested in nitric acid. The polymers were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a TA Instruments model DSC-2100 differential scanning calorimeter and by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a PL 220 liquid chromatograph equipped with refractive index and viscometer detectors. GPC analyses were performed using four Toso-Hass columns (HT6E, HT6E, HT7, and HT7) and a 20-micron filter. 3 Results and discussion Prior to catalyst immobilization on the support, the amount of ligand incorporated into the fumed silica was calculated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and can be seen on Table 1 . Values showed that, in a temperature range from 200°C to 700°C OH groups can still remain on silica surface and can be lost, as demonstrated by the small weight loss of support with no organic modification (FS). On the other hand, it is possible to note an increase on mass losses with the increase on surface modification, due to the higher amount of organic groups on silica surface. However, even when a big excess of Cl-ODS is used on silica modification reaction, it is not possible to achieve a complete substitution reaction by Cl and OH, reaching a maximum of 30% of organic group incorporation considering the initial added amount, and thus not consuming all OH groups of silica surface. Such behavior has been already reported in the literature and has been associated to the steric effect impinged by grafted species, which hinders further reactions between the residual surface silanol groups and the species in the solution [24]. Therefore, the treatment of support with MAO becomes necessary due to the high amount of residual OH group on the silica surface. Polymerization reactions were performed at 50 and 70°C under 120psi while varying the type of support (ratio of organic group used to modify commercial silica). The amount of incorporated metal into the modified silica determined by ICP OES analysis and used to calculate the catalyst productivity was approximately 60μmol of Ti/g (Table 1), representing approximately 60% of the incorporated metal. For the initial catalyst amount, no significant differences were observed with higher silane concentration in the support. The steric effect imposed by the FI catalyst itself may be sufficiently strong and determine the amount of the grafted catalyst. On the other hand, in spite of the same amount of metal found on resulting catalysts, their performance seems to be dependent on the amount of grafted organic modifier. One can speculate that the difference may be due to the nature of the grafted catalyst species: for none or lower grafted organosilane amounts, the availability of silanol groups on silica surface may allow the generation of bidentate species (which are inactive). As the amount of grafted orgasilanes increase, the amount of residual silanol groups reduces impinging the formation of monodentated species, which is traduced in an increasing in catalyst activity. SAXS analysis provides structural information about colloidal scales or scales of approximately 1–100nm. In this technique, the intensity (I) of an X-ray beam is scattered by the sample at the same wavelength as the source (λ) and is measured as a function of the length of the scattered wave vector, q=4π/λsin(θ/2), where θ is the scattered angle [25]. The primary particle formation of the supported catalysts is observed by the radius of gyration (Rg1) increasing from 20nm to 30nm following the increase of the ligand ratio used on the support, suggesting that organic groups prevent the formation of larger particles by the catalyst precursors. The α parameter is the Porod law exponent that relates the particle nanostructure to a fractal object through the relationship I(Q)=Q−α, where α assumes values between 1 and 4. This α parameter provides the information about the growth process [26,27]. A mass fractal structure is observed when the exponent value is between 1.0 and 3.0. A value between 3.0 and 4.0 represents a fractal structure for the secondary particles, while, for the exponent value of 4.0, the secondary particles may have a dense core and a uniform surface [28,29]. According to Table 1, mass fractal structure was observed for all catalytic systems with no difference observed when bare silica was used as the support. Analysis of the FTIR spectra in the 4000–2600cm−1 range shows the presence of the band assigned to asymmetric and symmetric CH2 vibrations in the heterogenized catalyst prepared on the modified silica (Fig. 1 ). The FTIR spectra of all supported catalysts show a weak peak approximately 2960cm−1 that is assigned to CH3 symmetric stretching due to the presence of MAO used to treat the support before the FI immobilization. The CH3 asymmetric stretching at approximately 2870cm−1 is almost undetectable starting from FS20, the stretching from CH2 starts to be noticeable, corresponding to the symmetric CH2 and asymmetric CH2 stretching at approximately 2857 and 2930cm−1, respectively [30]. However, the presence of CH2 chains of octadecyl groups is clearly observed only for supported catalysts on modified silica with more than a 50 (Cl:OH) ratio. Furthermore, estimation of the polymethylene chain ODS group conformation on the silica surface is possible by using the positions of these peaks. The peaks at approximately 2925 and 2855cm−1 are due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching, respectively, of the CH2 group. According to the literature, these peak positions are characteristic of a liquid-like configuration [31,32], which means that the polymethylene chain is in a more disordered configuration even in the presence of the FI grafted onto the support. All the systems were shown to be very active in ethylene polymerization. Table 2 shows the catalyst activity and polymer characteristics, such as molecular mass and polydispersity (Mw/Mn), as determined by the GPC technique, and melting temperatures, as determined by the DSC technique. The main effect of the reaction conditions is observed with the increase of Cl-ODS molecules that reacted with the fumed silica. The increase of the reacted amount on the support strongly affects the performance of these systems, resulting in higher catalyst activity. It is known that the organic groups used to modify the silica surface are consuming the silanol sites prior to catalyst grafting, generating a more spaced catalyst species and acting as horizontal spacers, thus avoiding bimolecular deactivation when the catalyst is immobilized on the support and leading to an improvement in the catalyst activity [33–35]. Furthermore, surface support modification by substitution of OH groups by octadecyl groups lead to a more hydrophobic silica which is chemically more compatible with catalyst recipe, increasing catalyst activity. All produced polymers by these system, show a very regular morphology, with a pellet-like form, as shown in Fig. 2 , proving that the polymerization takes place on support surfaces, suggesting replica phenomenon and that there is not leaching out in the solution phase. The GPC analysis confirms that all the resulting polymers are UHMWPE, but a slight decrease in the molecular mass of these polyethylenes occurs with increasing organic concentration on the modified silica surface. Similar results have been reported in the literature with systems of FI type catalysts and metallocenes. The results of molecular weight obtained with modified silica support are higher as those obtained with other type of supports, as POSS [2,15] and MgCl2 [16]. An inverse relationship between activity and Mw has been reported for metallocene catalysts as well, attributed to the increase in the rates of chain termination higher than polymer chain propagation (growth). In the case of metallocene, the increase in electron density on the active cation, increases the chain termination rate more than the chain propagation rate, leading to lower Mw [19,36]. Thereby, in the present system, a similar behavior may be attributed to the stabilization of the cationic active specie caused by the protection from the ligands on silica surface to the active center. It is important to mention that the Mw was not measured for the polymers produced at 70°C. Therefore, one cannot affirm that if it would have the same behavior between activity and Mw as the system obtained at 50°C. In summary, the increase in organic content on the support surface directly influences the catalyst activity and molecular mass of the polymer, with the higher catalyst activity leading to a smaller Mw in the produced polymers, as shown in Fig. 3 . It is important to note that the activities presented on Table 2 were calculated by taking into account the first 30min of reaction time. In Fig. 4 , longer reaction times are shown in the uptake profiles of the FI supported catalysts with different Cl-ODS ratios. Considering the effect of the temperature, a deactivation of the catalyst is observed with polymerization reactions at higher temperatures (see entries 1, 2, 6 and 7), confirming the high performance of FI catalysts types at lower temperatures. The melting temperatures of the first heating cycle found by the DSC analysis are higher than the temperatures reported in the literature, with a difference of approximately 10°C in the melting temperatures between the first and second scans [2,3,37]. According to Rastogi et al. [38], high melting temperatures are normally found for “chain-extended” polyethylene crystals. After the second heating, this high melting temperature is lost and the polymer recovers its normall melting temperature of 135°C. 4 Conclusions The FI immobilized catalysts on modified fumed silica were shown to have good activity for UHMWPE production. The higher the amount of organic ligands on the support increased the catalytic activity. This increase is probably due to the organic groups on the silica surface that may work as horizontally spacers of the active sites. The morphology of the resulting particles seems to follow the replica phenomenon. In sum, the modification of silica support may create active sites separated by the organic group on the support. Further investigations are necessary to better understand the limits of the influence of the presence of such organic groups in promoting these characteristics of polyethylene production.
