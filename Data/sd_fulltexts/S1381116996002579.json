France Received 14 June 1996: accepted 27 June 1996 Abstract In the course of systematic investigations, both the `H,W04/H=O,-Hz0/H3P04' and `H3[PW,=Ono} - yH20/H7OzH,O/H3POa' systems are found to show several 3'P and~183W NMR signals which can be assigned to new phosphatooxoperoxotungstate species, [PW,O,.]~- (x=1-4). It is clear that in the oxidations, the Keggin heteropolyanion is only a precursor to the true catalyst. The addition of Q+Cl- (an appropriate onium salt) to these systems leads to the isolation of pure crystalline salts: Q3[P04{WO(02)2}4], 1, and QZ[HPOQ{WO(O,),}2], 2. The solid state structure of [(nC4H9)4N]2[HP04{WO(Oz)z}z] is known. Synthesis and structural investigation of complexes with other assembling anions were also reported. Some of these complexes are: Q3[P04(Mo0(O1),}4], 3, QZ[SOQ{M00(OZ)z}2], 4, WAS04{WO(O-1)=}4], 5, Q2[HASOQ{WO(Oz)z}2], 6, Q2[CH3A803{WO(O1)2},] - H,O, 7, 2Q3[(HS04)(SOAW306(OZ)J] - 7H ,0. 8, Q,[W4,01(OZ)6(CH30H )2(CH 30)21, 9, etc. Some of these polyanions (1 to 7) have one or two neutral [M,O,( Nj-Oz)=(O_,),] moieties with one bridging and one non-bridging peroxo group on each W (or Mo) center. Infrared and/or Raman and ;1P and 183W NMR spectra show that the structures of the anions are conserved in organic solvents at room temperature. There is also clear evidence for the formation of [(P04){Mo4__rW,Ozo}]; in the reaction of IPM04014 ]3- and [PW,t0,4]3-; novel mixed compounds can be isolated. The salts with the [M, O,( A-0=)=(O=)=] moiety, in particular with M = W, are among the most efficient for the transfer of `active oxygen' to olefinic substrates. (R)-(+)-limonene is stoic hiometrically epoxidized; only half the peroxide oxygen is transferred to the olefinic substrate at room temperature. The results show an effect of the assembling ligand in stoichiometric systems and in phase transfer catalytic systems. Extended Hiickel molecular orbital calculations have been used to support an active oxygen-to-olefin transfer mechanism. The best mechanistic model involves direct interaction of one olefinic carbon atom with an oxygen atom of the peroxo groups without binding of the alkene to the transition metal center. ` Corresponding author.

Introduction Since the work of Beiles et al. [ 1 ], much research effort has been directed towards the synthesis and the characterization of novel d peroxo species with the assembling anions [P0413 , [AsO4]3 [2,3] or [C6HSPO3]'[4,5]. 376 G. Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 375-387 The oxoperoxo complexes containing molybdenum or tungsten have been widely proposed as both stoichiometric and catalytic oxidants in organic chemistry, mainly in Ishii-Venturello systems [2,3,6-12] or analogues with [Me2AS02]- or [PhzPOZ]- anions [13]; there are also implications in the preparation of novel materials [ 14]. In the course of our systematic investigations of the 'H2W04/H2O2-H2O/H3PO4' and `H 3[PW12040] ' yH20/H2O2-H2O/H3PO4' systems we have shown by 31 P and 183 W NMR the presence of new phosphatooxoperoxotungstate species, [PWXOy]Z- (x = 1-4) [ 11,15,16]. It is now clear that in the oxidations, the Keggin heteropolyanion [PM12040]3- (with M = Mo, W), is only a precursor to the true catalyst [7-12,15-17]. The addition of an appropriate onium salt Q+X- (e.g. Q+= (nBu4N)+, (PPN)+, (n-Hex4N)+, etc.) to these systems leads to the isolation of pure crystalline salts: Q31(P04)(W20201-02)2(002121, 1, and Qa[(HP04)(W2O2(9-O2)2 (02)21], 2. It is generally accepted that the metal center and the nature of the assembling ligand are of paramount importance in determining the activity of the peroxo complexes. These results led us to define several objectives: (i) The synthesis and structural investigation of analogues (changing the assembling anion). (11) A comparative study of their activity in stoichiometric oxidation reactions and in phasetransfer metal catalyzed epoxidations. (iii) Finally, we shall examine some proposals for an active oxygen-to-olefin transfer mechanism based on previous studies and extended Bickel molecular orbital calculations. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Crystal structures with the (M202(1,02)2(02 )27 moiety (M = Mo or W) Here, we considered some of the species related to 2, which can be isolated as tetrabuty- lammonium salts. The main results are summarized in Scheme 1. Other dinuclear peroxo species w ere isolated: [( nC4H9)4N]Z[(RASO3){W202( /.(.-02)2(02)2}] where R = OH or CH 3 [17] and [(nC4H9)4N]2[(SO4)iWz02( fi1-02)2(02)211 [121 with the previously known [(nC6H13)4N]3[(ASO4)iW2O2( bL-OZ)Z(O2)2)2] [18] a n d th e n o v e 1 s a lt: [(CH3)4N]3[(HS04)(SO4)iW306(O2)3)] ' 3.5H20 [ 12]. X-ray diffraction data on some of the tetranuclear and dinuclear anionic structures show that they are structurally very similar (Fig. 1). The anionic structures, in all cases, consist of an assembling anion: [AS04]3-, [HAS04 ]2-, [CH 3 AS03 ]Z-, [HP04 ]2-, [S04 ]2-, etc. and of one or two neutral groups, [WZO2( A,02)2(02)2], in which the W atoms are seven coordinated by oxygen atoms in a pentagonalbipyramidal arrangement (PBPY-7). All these polyanions have then one bridging and one non-bridging peroxo group on each W center, with slightly elongated peroxo O-O bonds. This dimeric unit, [W202(,u-02)2(02)2], is a common building block for all the oxoperoxotungstate species, which are highly active in stoichiometric and catalytic oxidation systems but easily deactivated by diols or epoxides [15]. We also considered the syntheses of some oxoperoxomolybdate species and studied the structure of the [PM04024]3- anion[ 19] which [HPW20141z_ [ASW40241R As043- HP04z_ [HS2W3020]2.

The crystal and molecular structures of these salts compare well with those described for the tungsten analogues (Fig. 2). 2.2. Vibrational spectroscopy and 31 P NMR data Vibrational data OR and Raman, solid state and solution) and 31 P NMR for complexes 1 and 2 suggest that the overall structures of these anions are maintained in organic solvents at room temperature [10-12,17]. There is also clear evidence (Fig. 3) for the formation of mixed anionic species [(P04){M04-,rWxO20}]3 ( x = 1, 2, 3) in the reaction of the [(n-C4H9)4N]+ salts [PMo4024j3_ 377 of IPM04024 ]3- and of [PW4024]3- in acetonitrile solution. Whatever the initial ratio, p ( p = [`PMo4']/[`PW4']), the 3tP NMR spectra of such solutions exhibit five lines, with relative intensities depending on p (Fig. 3). This pattern is obtained immediately after mixing the two components and the spectra do not change after a few days standing at room temperature. According to previous results, the high frequency line ( 8 = + 7.8 ppm; no W satellites) is assigned to IPM04024 ]3- [19] and the low frequency line ( 8 = +4.0 PPM; ZJP_W = 18.6 Hz) to [PW4024]3- [11]. The three other lines present also tungsten satellites, with nearly the same coupling constant (ZJP_W = 18.6-19.0 Hz); moreover, for each resonance the relative ISM02014 j2~ Fig. 2. Oxoperoxotungstate species containing one or two neutral groups, [M0202( li-O')_(02)-]. 378 M003 H3P04 ~H202~ H2S04 [PM024i3- Q3[PM0241 Scheme 2. [SM020141z_ [(n-Bu)4N]+Cl- [(n-Bu)4N]z[SMoz014] intensity of the satellites with respect to the central line [11] corresponds to X values of 1, 2 and 3 for the lines at 6.8, 5.85 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. According to these observations, the three new lines can be confidently assigned to the mixed anionic species, [PMo4 _ xWx024 ]3 with x = 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Table 1). The 31 P chemical shift variation through the whole series is consistent with the previous observations concerning phosphomolybdotungstate: replacement of tungsten by molybdenum in the mixed [PMoxWlz-x040]3 Keggin oxoanions induces a deshielding of the 31 P nucleus (0 83, P = + 1 ppm per Mo/W replacement [20]). At room temperature the line assigned to [(P04)Mo2W2020 ]3- appears, however, significantly broader than the resonances of the four other species. In fact, at lower temperature the line of `PMo2W2' splits into two narrow lines PM03W PM04 xs L.

Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Cataltsis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 375-387 change between the two isomers is rapid on the 31 P NMR time scale at room temperature (coalescence of the two resonances) but becomes slow enough at low temperature ( - 20) for both resonances to be observed. Interconversion between the two isomers implies the breaking of the dimeric units without affecting the four P-O-M (M = Mo, W) junctions. The activated species obtained in this way, [(P04)MOZW20\"o]3-, could be implicated in the stoichiometric or catalytic reactions. All these 31 P NMR spectra can be understood if we consider that there are several equilibria which may be tentatively summarized by schemes involving oxodiperoxo species, {MO(O,)2(HZO)J, related to Mimoun's mononuclear complexes, [MO(O2)ZL'L2] (Ll, L'- = HMPA and H20) [21,22]. Recent results of Griffith et al. [5] show that this unit is one of th e b u ild in g b to c k s o f [NMe4],,[(PhPOAWO(OZ)2]2{WO(02),(HZO)]]. Moreover, these results compare well with the 31 P NMR spectrum obtained after exchange between H3[PMo12040] - aq and H3[PW1204o] - aq in water. However, in non-protic organic solvents such an exchange between different HPAS is not observed [20]. In this case, the splitting of the resonances is due to the existence of several positional isomers. From the stepwise appearance of new signals, it seems likely that exchanges involve single oxo MOand/or oxohydroxo units only (M = Mo or W). The formation of positional isomers, `PMo2W2', was also o b se rv e d w ith th a `( n - 379 Off cis-isomer traps-isomer Scheme 3.

It appears from these experiments that if the overall structures of these anions can be maintained, the NMR experiments (when possible) show that dynamic systems can exist even at ordinan, temperature. 2.3. Stoichiometric oxidation reactions We must keep in mind these possibilities and the fact that catalysis is a purely kinetic phenomenon accomplished by intermediates or transients, but not generally by isolable complexes. Comparison of the activity of all these novel dinuclear anionic species, which can be used as catalysts or catalyst precursors, was nevertheless attempted. We chose the reaction of (R)-( +) limonene which is stoichiometrically epoxidized at room temperature (the temperature of physicochemical measurements).

Nearly half the peroxidic oxygen is transferred to the olefinic substrate at room temperature, but only for the dinuclear com plexes with similar {M202( A-02)2(02)2) units (Fig. 4). This means that only half the peroxo group is available for producing oxygenated product at RT. The [PMo4024]3- anion is not a good stoichiometric epoxidizing agent com pared to the other dinuclear anions. The order of decreasing activity towards epoxidation of (R) ( + )-lim onene was found to be: `SW2' > `AsW2' > `PW2' > `SMo2' `PMo4'.

Some results of catalytic tests In the presence of a dilute aqueous solution of H202, the active precursor or catalyst can be regenerated in most cases, thus forming the basis for catalytic oxidations of alkenes and other substrates by H 202 using phase-transfer catalysis, PTC (Scheme 4). The assembling ligand X (X = P04 -, AS04 -, HP04 -, HAs04 -, CH3As03-, S04-, etc.) causes no reaction, but a peroxo group can transfer `active oxygen' to the olefinic substrate. In most cases, the best results are obtained with Arquad 2HT ' as phase transfer agent.

Theoretical approach to the mechanism epoxidation of alkene using 71 z-peroxocomplexes and heteropolyperoxo complexes containing rl2, 771-peroxo linkages We shall now consider a theoretical approach to the mechanism of the epoxidation of alkene using one of the dinuclear complexes.

We considered another good model [(n-C4H9)4N]2[(HAs04)1Wz02( /,Oz)2(O_),}], `AsW-,', with a crystal structure refined to R = 0.033 and Rw = 0.035 and for which the spectral data suggest that the overall structure is maintained in organic solvents at room temperature [17]. We keep in mind that the transient active species may be different from the binuclear complex `AsW2' or even of the mononuclear `WO(OZ)2(H20),' moiety: dynamic exchange evidenced by 31 P NMR experiments with the `PW4/PMo4' system (vide supra) may also occur for the dinuclear unit. The objective is the search, if any, of `privileged peroxidic oxygen' for the transfer of active oxygen to olefinic substrate, but not a detailed mechanism. Here we take C , H 4 as a model for olefins. According to Mimoun [24] the mechanism for the oxygen-to-olefin transfer of an oxygen atom of a side-bonded rl`-peroxo ligand of the diperoxidic complexes [MO(O2)2 L' L' ], starts with the coordination of the alkene on the metal center (M-coordination, Fig. 5a). For the dmetal centers, the interaction results uniquely from the -ir-donation of the olefin to an empty orbital of the metal, since no back-donation is possible from the metal (the non-bonding d HZC i' i0 l of ~0 CHz a CHZ H2 C i ~i 6 '11 M0- 0 C! .1 / b Fig. 5. Illustration of the two postulated interactions of the alkene with (a) the coordination of C2 Ha to molybdenum (Vt) by which the alkene loses its nucleophilic character, (b) with the interaction of C, H4 with one of the peroxo groups of the [Mo0(O=),LlL`] complex (L1, L= = H=O, HMPA, etc.). 382 L. Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 375-387 orbitals are vacant). This situation is less favorable than with centers such as Pd, Pt and Rh that possess d electrons available for back-donation. This is one argument that led Sharpless [25] to propose a coordination to one oxygen from the peroxo, generating a three-membered ring as transition state (Fig. 5b). Jorgensen and Hoffmann [26] have investigated the slipping motion of the alkene from Mo to O of an 'qz-peroxo ligand and concluded that the best initial approach did correspond to the coordination to the metal, as proposed by Mimoun, but that the transition state obtained in a further step was close to that proposed by Sharpless, the slipping motion being favored when donation from the oxygen pairs of the peroxo 7r to the 7rczH4 orbital of the olefin is optimal. Experimental results indicate that the mechanism for the oxygen-transfer step from the tungsten-peroxo complex to the alkene involves attack of the alkene on one of the peroxidic oxygens of the complex [27]. More recently, a different mechanism via nucleophilic attack of alkene on an electrophilic oxygen of the coordinated peroxo group was proposed on the basis of a theoretical analysis; the decrease in the electrophilicity of the 7-coordinated diperoxo molybdenum complexes is the reason why these complexes are much less reactive towards epoxidation of olefins than the 6-coordinated ones [28]. This is one argument which can be considered with the heteropolyperoxotungstates containing '12,711-peroxo linkages, since they have structures in which one of the two oxygen atoms of a side-bonded n2-peroxo ligand forms a very weak bond (-7t) to an adjacent tungsten atom. Nevertheless, for our binuclear anionic complex [(HAs04){Wz0z( A-02)2(02)2}]Z-, each metal center is surrounded by ligands and the direct M-coordination of the olefin must be ruled out for a static model. The reaction should then begin by interaction of the olefin with an oxygen atom (O-coordination). We must optimize donation from an oxygen pair (a 7r orbital) to the 7r,*zH4 orbital. Referring to the mononuclear complex (Fig. 5), it seems that the reaction O ~3 1.470 A [0.364] O . 6 05 O OH \\A's W 1.987 .'[0.254] Z.396~VV~?

The initial dinuclear anionic species, `AsW2' with some interatomic distances ( and overlap populations: []. starts at a stage that is only obtained once the olefin is in the vicinity of the O atom. In the following, we shall first consider the Mulliken atomic charges and overlap populations in the binuclear complexes. Then, we shall investigate models for the interaction between the ethylene molecule and the binuclear complex, [(HAs04){W202(,ct,-02)2(02)2}]2 denoted `AsW2' (Fig. 6). 2.5.1. Mulliken atomic charges Let us first consider the charges on the oxygen atoms related to the anionic binuclear complex. The donation from the oxygen pairs of the peroxo to the olefin should be efficient when the oxygen atoms have large negative charges. The charges increase in the order: 03 > OS > 04 06, 1 Qp I being 0.722, 0.716, 0.708 and 0.627, respectively, suggesting that the olefin coordination preferentially takes place on atom 03. On the contrary, coordination on atom 06 seems very unlikely. The O charges are not sufficiently sensitive to the nature of the central atom (replacement of Mo by W, assuming the same geometry, gives nearly the same charges). Consequently, this simple model does not help with the comparison of the various binuclear complexes. To improve the model, it is probably necessary to take into account the variation of the geometry with the L. Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical Ill (1997) 375-387 A A' Fig. 7. O;-/C=H, interaction. Donation from a 7r orbital to a 7TCC orbital is represented for a parallel orientation (A) and for an optimized geometry (). nature of the metal and of the assembling ligand. 2.5.2. Overlap populations The reactivity of the O atoms should decrease with increasing coordination. From this point of view, atom O6 would be weakly reactive. The sum of the overlap populations for the two metal-oxygen bonds O6-W, 0.42, is larger than the values for the other atoms, 0.31-0.33. Considering the overlap populations (see Fig. 6), we get again the order of reactivity: 03 > Oa >056. 2.5.3. OM interactions. The C, H4 + OZ - model The n'-peroxo fragments in the complexes appear as OZ- moieties. The simplest model consists of OZ- interacting with CZH4. The ar \" orbital (HOMO) of the peroxidic anion is occupied and donation to the 7r * orbital of the olefin suggests, at first sight, a symmetric geometry (interaction labelled A in diagrams of Fig. 7A and Fig. 8). Thus, the ( 7rc=H ~'rr-) overlap is maximized whereas the 'rrca and the 7r- orbital cannot overlap for reasons of symmetry. As- 0 suming 2 A for the CO distance, also used by Jgensen [26], the interaction energy is repulsive by 0.98 eV (94.5 kJ/mol). The main reason is a repulsion between subjacent occupied symmetric orbitals: 7rc H+ and -rrov- (see S on diagram in Fig. 8). To avoid this repulsion a distorted model must be considered. The distortion consists in binding the two fragments by 383 Energy 6* CzHa Ozz_ Fig. 8. Molecular orbital diagram for the O;-/C, H4 interaction. one end and moving the two other ends away from each other, as shown in Fig. 7A'. Each fragment involves a 7r ` orbital (either C,H4 or O22-) and the best orientation for a reactant (the partner or in general a reactant R - see Scheme 5) with the 7r ' orbital is of the order of 110 For C , H a Tr * is the LUMO and R is a nucleophile. For the approach of the nucleophile to a carbonyl group, it was found that the maximal overlap between a nucleophile (say H-) interacting with a 7r * orbital (7rc*o) is obtained for B = 105[29]. In our case, B ,, the angle of approach for 02- as nucleophile, is comparable, 110(Fig. 7A'). Considering now the orientation relative to O-O- (7- is the HOMO), the maximal overlap of an electrophilic reactant is along the direction of a `spa' lone pairs. The best interaction between two rr ` orbitals is therefore that described in Fig. 7A. Assuming 2 0 A for the CA-OA distance, optimization of the Scheme 5.

Newman representation for the Oz- - C2 4H system along the OACA direction for = 60 The o-CAC g bond conjugates with the antiparallel lone pair on OA. This conjugation explains the preferential orientation for 0 = 60 Note that the primary interaction between CA and OA involving the a \" orbital is not visible on this Newman representation. OBOACA and CBCAOA angles ( = 112and = 110 leads to a stabilizing interaction of 1.19 eV (114.5 kJ/mol). In contrast with the importance of these angles, the CA-CB can easily rotate around the CA-OA direction; the planar geometry is slightly less stable than a gauche orientation (Scheme 6). This orientation is explained by a secondary interaction along the CA-OA direction, shown below on a Newman projection (Scheme 6): The methylene group and the oxygen do not overlap because the conformation results from the conjugation of an oxygen lone pair with the O-CA-CB bond. The optimized dihedral angle OB-OA-CACB9 is 60 The improvement in energy relative to the planar configuration is only 0.03 eV (2.9 kJ/mol). 2.5.4. OM interactions. The CZ H4 + binuclear complex model Finally, we performed several calculations with the binuclear anionic complex interacting with CZH4, also assuming a CA-OA distance of 2 There is a great number of possible ethylene orientations; we have made two choices: first of all, Fig. 9 (model 1) corresponds to linear W-Oi , * * CA (with i = 3-6). This favors the mononuclear fragment, assuming that the local coordination is the main factor. In another choice, Fig. 10 (model 2), CA is oriented opposite to the middle, I, of the W . . .

Four approaches are represented for the ethylene molecule. The CA ~ ~ ~ O; distance is 2A. CA-CB is rotated around the O;CA axis. This ensures that the ethylene stands in the open space and avoids steric repulsion with the remaining part of the complex. In both cases we have varied the CA-CB orientation around the O;-CA direction. For most of the approaches, the interaction is stabilizing in the range of ca. 3.5 eV (ca. 334 kJ/mol in absolute values) (see Figs. 11 and 12). The interaction energy does not vary very much with the dihedral angle, except when two atoms are moved close together. This is the case for the approach on atom 06 (model 1) where atom C B is too close to atom 03 attached to the other metal center. This atom (O6) clearly cannot be the reactive center.

Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Catah~sis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 375-387 Atoms 03 and 04 come out slightly ahead, before atom 05. The most important factor seems to be the accessibility of the oxygen atom. The importance of this factor should increase with larger olefins. The difference between the reactivity of the oxygen atom is small. The less coordinated atoms are slightly more reactive than the others. 2.5.5. Possible assistance by the oxo group For the mononuclear complex, oxidation could be initiated by coordination to the metal center [24]. Next, the olefin migrates to react with the peroxo group that is necessarily involved in the oxidation process [26]. In the case of the binuclear complex, the oxidation process can benefit from an initial interaction with the oxo group. Indeed, this center appears according to various criteria to be involved in a much stronger interaction with the olefinic substrate than the oxygen from the peroxo group. Its net charge is the largest, -1.37 e, facilitating donation to ethylene, considered as an electrophile, by interaction with the 7rCZH4 orbital. The neighbourhood of the oxo group is less crowded than that of the peroxo groups. The W atom is the only atom coordinated to the oxo oxygen. All these considerations could favor an interaction with the oxo group. We performed the calculation of the reacting system with an OoXO CA distance of 2 A and found the largest interaction energy, 382.9 kJ/mol (3.97 eV), when W = O - - - CA is linear (O - - - CA-CB = 107. When the ethylene is oriented such that W = O - - - CA is equal to 165with CB closer to one peroxo oxygen atom, 04, then the C B-04 0 distance becomes 2.12 A and the system is destabilized by 95.6 kJ/mol. However, the in teraction energy of the system remains stabiliz ing by 287.3 kJ/mol. For this geometry, the overlap population of the C B . . . 04 bond is slightly positive whereas that of the CA * - , OOXo bond becomes slightly negative. This indicates that the ethylene molecule is transferred to the reacting oxygen atom of the peroxo group. Such destabilization does not seems prohibitive; note that for the mononuclear complex, the slipping motion away from the metal center also implied a destabilization [26]. 3. Conclusion We have been able to isolate and to characterize two categories of heteropolyoxoperoxometalates which can be considered as `nonlacunary species', including the Beiles complex [PM04024]3- denoted `PM04', the Venturello complexes [PW4024]3-, [ASW4024]3 , denoted `PW4' and `ASW4', or as `lacunary species': [HPW20,4]2-, [HASW2014]2`, [CH3AsW2013]2-, [SW2014]2 , [SM02014]2-, etc. The chemistry of classical polyoxometalates and of the parent peroxide species has led us to propose analogies between the Keggin moiety and the [XM4024]3- anions, and between the two kinds of lacunary species (those isolated with polyoxometalates and those with the IM20101 moiety). Most of these heteropolyoxoperoxo complexes have one or two neutral [M202(,u,02)2(02)2] moieties (M = Mo, W). This dimeric unit has, in each case, two distinct pairs of peroxo ligands: one non-bridging (r12), and one bridging (r12, r11) peroxo group on each M center. Spectral data (infrared and/or Raman and 31 P NMR spectra) show that the structures of the anions are conserved in organic solvents at room temperature. The activities, both stoichiometric and catalytic, depend on the nature of the metal and its assembling ligand ([P04]3-, [HP04]2-, [HAs04]2-, [S04]2-, etc.). Usually oxoperoxotungstates with (W20io) moieties are more active than oxoperoxomolybdates with the {M 020 10) unit. The formation of [(PO4){M04_XYOZO]]3 In the reaction of [PM04024]3- and of [PW4024]3- was clearly identified by 31P NMR experiments. These processes have been applied to the preparation of mixed Keggin units [30]. It appears, from these data that dynamic systems can exist, every at L. Salles et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 11711997) 375- 387 room temperature. A dynamic model could contribute to the reactivity of these complexes, but is difficult to consider it in the representation of the interaction of the peroxidic complexes with an olefinic substrate. Extended Hiickel molecular orbital calculations support an outer-sphere mechanism for active oxygen-to-olefin transfer as the best mechanistic model. According to our calculations based on a system with ethylene and a static anionic complex [(HAs04)(W,O,( ~t,-O,),(OZ)j]'`-, the three less coordinated peroxidic oxygen atoms of a W center are slightly more reactive than the others. In the case of this binuclear tungsten anion, the oxidation process can benefit from an initial assistance by the oxo group without coordination to the metal center. References [I] R.G. Beiles. Z.E.

It is clear that in the oxidations, the Keggin heteropolyanion is only a precursor to the true catalyst. The addition of Q+Cl− (an appropriate onium salt) to these systems leads to the isolation of pure crystalline salts: Q3[PO4{WO(O2)2}4], 1, and Q2[HPO4{WO(O2)2}2], 2. The solid state structure of [(n-C4H9)4N]2[HPO4{WO(O2)2}2] is known. Synthesis and structural investigation of complexes with other assembling anions were also reported. Some of these complexes are: Q3[PO4{MoO(O2)2}4], 3, Q2[SO4{MoO(O2)2}2], 4, Q3[AsO4{WO(O2)2}4], 5, Q2[HAsO4{WO(O2)2}2], 6, Q2[CH3AsO3{WO(O2)2}2] · H2O, 7, 2Q3[(HSO4)(SO4){W3O6(O2)3}] · 7H2O, 8, Q2[W4O6(O2)6(CH3OH)2(CH3O)2], 9, etc. Some of these polyanions (1 to 7) have one or two neutral [M2O2(μ-O2)2(O2)2] moieties with one bridging and one non-bridging peroxo group on each W (or Mo) center. Infrared and/or Raman and 31P and 183W NMR spectra show that the structures of the anions are conserved in organic solvents at room temperature. There is also clear evidence for the formation of [(PO4){Mo4−x W x O20}]3− in the reaction of [PMo4O24]3− and [PW4O24]3−; novel mixed compounds can be isolated. The salts with the [M2O2(μ-O2)2(O2)2] moiety, in particular with M = W, are among the most efficient for the transfer of ‘active oxygen’ to olefinic substrates. (R)-(+)-limonene is stoichiometrically epoxidized; only half the peroxide oxygen is transferred to the olefinic substrate at room temperature. The results show an effect of the assembling ligand in stoichiometric systems and in phase transfer catalytic systems. Extended Hückel molecular orbital calculations have been used to support an active oxygen-to-olefin transfer mechanism. The best mechanistic model involves direct interaction of one olefinic carbon atom with an oxygen atom of the peroxo groups without binding of the alkene to the transition metal center.

        "dc:description": "In the course of systematic investigations, both the ‘H2WO4/H2O2-H2O/H3PO4’ and ‘H 3[PW 12 O 40] · yH 2 O/H 2 O 2-H 2 O/H 3 PO 4’ systems are found to show several 31P and 183W NMR signals which can be assigned to new phosphatoox-operoxotungstate species, [PW x O y ] z− (x = 1–4). It is clear that in the oxidations, the Keggin heteropolyanion is only a precursor to the true catalyst.
