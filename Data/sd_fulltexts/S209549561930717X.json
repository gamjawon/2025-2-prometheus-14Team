Lithium metal has been considered to be the most promising anode material for the new generation of energy-storage system. However, challenges still stand in protecting lithium metal from spontaneous reactions with electrolytes and preventing the dendritic propagation, both of which would lead to undesirable decrease in Coulombic efficiency. Polysulfone (PSf) membrane with high rigidity and free-volume cavities of approximately 0.3 nm was employed to provide a stable interface on the surface of anodic electrode. The isotropic channels were constructed by the interconnected and uniformly distributed free volumes in the polymer matrix, and were expected to be swelled by solvent molecules and anions of lithium salt and to allow Li+ ions to pass through onto the electrode surface. As a result, dendrite-free morphology of deposited lithium was observed. The stabilized interface arose from the PSf film was verified by the promoted performances of Cu|Li cells and steady voltage polarization of Li|Li cells. The full cell with PSf coated anode exhibited excellent cyclability (85% capacity retention rate over 400 cycles at 1 C) and an outstanding rate capability (117 mAh g− 1 at 5 C). The beneficial performances were further verified by the EIS results. This work provides a new strategic idea to settle the dendritic problems of Li metal anodes. Graphical abstract Polysulfone membrane with free-volume cavities of 0.3 nm was employed to provide a stable anodic interface to faciliate uniform Li deposition and non-dendritic morphology.

As the most promising source of energy storage, lithium batteries have been widely concerned and studied since primary market introduction in 1991 and their energy densities have to be further improved to enable continued market growth [1–3]. Lithium metal has been highly anticipated as “Holy Grail” of anode materials due to its highest theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and the lowest electrochemical potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) [4,5]. As an important component of Li-S and Li-O2 batteries with high energy density [6–8], lithium metal has extremely low density and is environmentally friendly, which is considered to be the most promising anode material for the new generation of energy-storage system. However, challenges still stand in protecting lithium metal from spontaneous reactions with electrolytes and preventing the dendritic propagation, both leading to undesirable decrease in Coulombic efficiency [9,10]. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), generated from the thermodynamically reactions between lithium and electrolyte, is too brittle to completely isolate the metal from the organic electrolyte and would continuously consume the lithium metal in the break and reformation process during cycling. The inception and propagation of dendrites are expected to facilitate the process with an increase in surface area of the electrode and a consequence increase in reaction sites [11–13]. Many strategies [14–23] have been proposed to prevent the formation of dendrites. Most focus on the suppression of lithium dendrite by lowering the specific surface area so as to further prevent the cracking of fragile dendrites and to limit side reactions on the interface, which are thermodynamically favorable and would not be completely inhibited unless the contact of the two reactants is avoided. In this regard, artificial SEI has been explored to resolve these issues. Inorganic materials are most popular candidates for their high modulus and high ionic conductivities, such as hexagonal boron nitride [24], lithium phosphorus oxynitride [25], SiO2 [26], Al2O3 particles [27,28] and ultrathin Al2O3 film [29]. Nevertheless, most inorganic compounds are easy to break with loads applied during repeated plating/stripping processes, which is supposed to lose its insulating properties. Hybrid membranes [30,31] have been recently developed as artificial SEI to obtain properties of both flexibility and mechanical strength, which exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and prolonged battery cycling even in carbonate electrolytes, indicating an effective prevention in side reactions in spite of defect propagation at the organic/inorganic interface after long-term use. As an alternative, organics have rarely been employed due to its low ionic conductivities and low mechanical strengths. When applied, nanosized channels [32,33] have to be designed to ensure efficient transport of Li+ ions onto the electrode surface and to avoid the possibility of mechanical deformation. Nanosized channels enable the uniform distribution of Li+ ions flux, the dominant factor for the suppression of lithium dendrites [34–40], but are usually too wide to block the large molecules in the electrolyte. Thus, better electrochemical performances would be expected if the size of nanochannels were further decreased to the scale comparable to the diameter of Li+ ions to ensure both uniform flux and allow only Li+ ions to pass [41,42]. Meanwhile, no excessive resistance must be guaranteed [43,44]. In this respect, polysulfone (PSf) membrane with free-volume cavities of approximately 0.3 nm was employed to provide a stable interface on the surface of anodic electrode, inhibiting the formation of lithium dendrite and limiting side reactions. The interconnected free volumes were created by the gaps left between the entangled polymer chains, uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix, and highly related with transport properties. They constructed isotropic channels, which were expected to be swelled by solvent molecules and anions of lithium salt and to allow Li+ ions to pass through onto the electrode surface (Fig. 1). The thickness of the membrane was controlled under 1 µm to reduce diffusion resistance. Advanced tips are also adopted to ensure a uniform thickness. The soft and rigid segments of PSf chains provide required properties of both flexibility and high strength. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of materials The PSf particles were first dispersed and stirred in the purified N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a slurry in a specific concentration. Then a certain amount of the solution is spread on a copper or lithium foil applied on a horizontal platform without bubbles beforehand and is evacuated at a constant and uniformly distributed vapor pressure until the solvent is totally evaporated. The homogenous and stable vapor pressure would prevent shrinkage of the surface from the boundary and ensure a uniform thickness of the PSf film. The obtained Cu and Li foils with PSf coating were denoted as Cu@PSf and Li@PSf respectively. All the procedures were operated in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). 2.2 Characterization The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured using the NICOLET IS10 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed by the Waters 1515 system. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) analysis was performed using a fast-slow coincident ORTEC system with 22Na as a positron source and a source strength of 13 micro-residues. The positron annihilation lifetime spectrum is measured by fast-slow compliance measurement technology, using a pair of BaF2 scintillation detectors to detect the gamma rays released after positron annihilation. The total lifetime spectrum is 2 million to ensure statistically reliable, and the time resolution is 195 ps. The morphologies of the polymer film and deposited lithium were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta FEG 250). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements Cu|Li cells were assembled as 2025-type coin cells with bare Cu foil or Cu@PSf as the cathode and a Li foil as the anode, Celgard 2400 as the separator. The electrolyte was 1.0 M lithium bis (trifluor-omethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) dissolved in DOL and DME (1:1 by volume) with 2% LiNO3 in it. For full cells, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes were prepared by mixing the LFP power, carbon black (Super P) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the mass ratio of 8:1:1. The counter electrode was bare Li foil or Li@PSf, and the electrolyte was 1.0 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in EC and DEC (1:1 by volume). All the batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). The galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles were conducted using a Neware battery management system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on EC-lab at a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV. 3 Results and discussion The structural unit of PSf is composed of benzene rings, two ether groups and a sulfone group, as shown in Fig. 1 . It is believed that the diphenylene sulfone group confers the inherent characteristics of high strength, thermal stability and oxidation resistance to the polymer molecule, while the ether groups present little steric hindrance to rotation making ether-containing chains flexible enough to accommodate the volume change during cycling. The functional groups and chemical composition of the PSf we employed were determined by FT-IR (Fig. 2 a). The characteristic peaks of PSf in the FT-IR spectrum were approximately at 1585, 1490, 1235 and 1015 cm−1, which were assigned to the stretching mode of the benzene ring, the asymmetric stretching vibration of the sulfonyl group and the asymmetric stretching vibration of aromatic ether [45,46]. No impurities were observed. The existence of ether and methylene groups in the chains of PSf intended to disturb the regular packing of rigid chains and to create more amorphous regions and more free volumes. The average molecular weight of the PSf was evaluated to be 164 kDa with a narrow molecular weight distribution (M w/M n = 1.22) (Fig. 2b), indicating polymers of similar lengths and long molecules with many entanglements, which was sufficient to increase tensile strength and the number of free volumes. The size and concentration of free-volume cavities in the polymer matrix were studied using the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) technique (Table 1). As indicated by the parameter τ 3, the longer pick-off annihilation of the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) component, the mean size of the free-volume cavities in the PSf matrix was approximately 0.287 nm, which was comparable to the diameter of Li+ ions (0.152 nm) but much smaller than that of the anions and solvent molecules. The relative concentration was derived from the annihilation intensity I 3 and was estimated to be 15.65%, suggesting abundant free volumes for Li+ ions diffusion [47,48] . The morphology of the PSf film was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The surface of the bare PSf film exhibited a smooth morphology without any defect visible at a scale of 2 µm (Fig. 3a), while the cross section image (Fig. 5a, insert image) showed a consistent thickness of approximately 1 µm, indicating a successful coating of ultrathin PSf film with a uniform thickness on the electrode. A cycled half-cell with a plating capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2 on the coated electrode was disassembled to detailed research the morphology of the Li deposition on the bare Cu and Cu@PSf current collector. It was revealed that the film still preserves its original appearance (Fig. 3b), and only a few small round-edge protrusions were observed on the surface. Bulk lithium metal without any dendritic morphology was found under the film (Fig. 3c) after 30 cycles, in comparison with the growth of large amount of Li dendrites (Fig. 3e and f) induced by the inhomogeneous electric field near the rough surface of Cu foil (Fig. 3d). The deposition of lithium metal under the membrane indicated the transfer of Li+ ions through the PSf film and the reception of electrons near the electrode, which confirmed the properties of the film to be with low resistance allowing Li+ ions to flood through the membrane onto the surface of the current collector, and flexible and rigid enough to accommodate the volume expansion and to stay intact after long cycles. The non-dendritic lithium demonstrates that the coating of PSf film weakened the influence of the inhomogeneous electric field on the morphology of lithium. The reason was probably that, the isotropic channels constructed by the interconnected free volumes in the polymer matrix and the uniform thickness observed from the SEM image together ensured the uniform flux of Li+ ions near the electrode surface and thus uniform deposition of Li atoms under the PSf film (Fig. 3a). The large molecules swelling the PSf polymer and trapped in the network of chain entanglements served as the medium for the transfer of Li+ ions. The prevention of dendrite formation by the PSf film, decreasing the specific surface and incremental sites for side reactions, is expected to inhibit the consumption of solvents in the electrolyte and consequently to result in a long cycling performance. Electrochemical tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of the PSf film on electrochemical performances. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed in half-cell configuration. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the PSf coating on the surface of the electrode enabled the stable and long cycling with a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) value. At the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, the initial CE of Cu@PSf|Li was as high as 98% and still remained a high value of 95.6% after 200 cycles. As comparison, the CE of bare Cu|Li decreased quickly to 80% within 100 cycles. As the current density increased to 1.0 mA cm−2, the CE of the Cu@PSf|Li was 93% for the first cycle, then increased to 99.5% from the 5th cycle and only reduced to 90% after 150 cycles. Once the CE value dropped down to blew 90%, it began to decline rapidly due to the broken of the film. The prolonged cycling performance was attributed to the existence of the film avoiding direct contact between the electrolyte and the electrode, lowering the influence of non-uniform electric field intensity on the current collector, and creating a stable interface and controlled morphology of lithium. The flexibility of the polymer film enabled adaptive responses to repeated volume expansion, while the rigidity arose from the benzene rings in the chains allowed the film to move up and down so as to accommodate the Li deposition. This was consistent with that observed in the SEM images. However, the CE curve at 1.0 mA cm−2 was not as smooth as that of 0.5 mA cm−2. The low degree of swelling for PSf in the electrolyte accounted for the phenomenon, whereas limit solvent molecules or anions distributed along the inner wall of the channels formed by free volumes to act as an adsorption site and to help large amount of Li+ ions cross the PSf film simultaneously, resulting in insufficient mass transfer, high resistance and unstable CE. The symmetric cells were also assembled to investigate the main short circuit event induced by Li dendrites (Fig. 5 ). At a current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2, the increase of voltage polarization was discovered only a few hours from the beginning for the bare Li|Li cell. A sudden drop of the voltage profile at approximately 180 h indicated the total failure of the cell caused by the dendritic growth of lithium and the complex surface chemistry of the electrode. As comparison, the PSf-protected symmetric cell displayed a lower voltage polarization and longer valid cycle life for over 250 h, declaring a stable electrode/electrolyte interface. It was speculated that the dendrite-free morphology arose from the PSf coating was also achieved on the lithium electrode just as that observed on the Cu electrode from the SEM images (Fig. 3e and f). Side reactions were greatly suppressed, the resistance of the interface was stabilized by the coating, and thus Li+ ions were allowed to shuttle back and forth regularly and continuously in a long time. The beneficial performance from the PSf coating on the lithium electrode was further evaluated in the full cell configuration for an assessment of the artificial SEI under practical conditions. Lithium anode, LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode, and carbonate electrolyte of 1.0 M LiPF6-EC/DEC (1:1 by volume) without any addition were adopted. All the LFP cathodes maintained the typical mass loading of active materials of approximately 2.0 mg cm−2. The cells were firstly cycled at 0.1 C for 3 cycles to activate the active substance and were further charged and discharged at 1 C to evaluate the durability of the bare and protected electrodes (Fig. 6 a). The cell with the bare Li foil as the anode exhibited a rapid capacity retention to 80% of the initial capacity within 60 cycles, indicating unfavorable changes on the lithium foil as the structure of the LFP was highly reversible. Without protection, the lithium was supposed to deposit on the surface of the anode in dendritic morphology, leading to the formation of dead Li and unstable interface. As comparison, the cell with the protected electrode showed significantly enhanced performance with discharged capacity of over 120 mAh g−1 for 400 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency exceeding 90%. The voltage-areal capacity profiles (Fig. 6b) before and after cycling gave explanations for the differences. The overpotential of the unmodified cell showed a substantial increase only during 50 cycles, directly accounting for the rapid capacity retention of the cell (Fig. 6a). The initial overpotential of the modified cell (160 mV) was slightly lower than that of the unmodified one (250 mV), and remained stable in the following 100 cycles, which was consistent with the performance of the symmetric cells and confirmed the positive effect of the PSf coating on stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface not only in the ether-based but also carbonate-based electrolytes. The rate performances of the full cells were also promoted by the PSf coating (Fig. 6c). The cells were charged to 4.2 V and discharge to 2.8 V at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 C for 10 cycles, respectively, and then cycled at 0.5 C for 10 cycles. Highly reversible capacities of 151, 147, 142, 133, and 117 mAh g−1 were observed at various C-rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 C, respectively, in comparison with the much lower capacities of 148, 143, 132, 116, and 83 mAh g−1 for the cell with bare lithium anode. As the C-rate was again lowered to 0.5 C, a capacity of 146 mAh g −1 was obtained for the cell with PSf coated anode, corresponding to a capacity recovery rate of nearly 97%. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was conducted to further understand the effect of the PSf coating on the cells. The Cu|Li configuration was employed, and the charged cells after the 10th, 70th, and 150th cycles were tested. The distinct two semi-circular arcs were observed at the frequency range from 100 kHz to 50 mHz for the cell with bare lithium anode. The high frequency semi-circular arc represented the SEI resistance (R SEI), while the low frequency semi-circular arc corresponded to the charge transfer resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte (R ct). The equivalent circuit for the unmodified cell was shown in Fig. 7 (a). The semi-circle at low frequencies was larger than that at high frequencies (Fig. 7b-d), indicating that the resistance of the charge transfer is the rate-determining step. After the 150th cycle, the resistances of both the charge transfer and the SEI were significantly decreased due to the inner short circuit (Fig. 7d). For the cell with PSf coated anode, the semi-circle of the high frequency accounts for the charge transfer resistance (R ct) and the low frequency tail corresponds to the diffusion resistance between the PSf coating and the electrode (Q 3) (Fig. 7f-h). Higher slope of this tail indicated smaller diffusion resistance and lower values signified enhanced solid phase diffusion resistance. The impedance tail appeared as a straight line with a slope of approximately 45° for the cell after 10 cycles (Fig. 7f), which greatly improved with the cycle number increased to 70 (Fig. 7g), suggesting the propagation of the channels for Li+ ions and the intactness of the PSf coating during cycling. As the cell worked for 150 cycles, the low frequency response changed from a straight line to an arc (Fig. 7h), demonstrating the cracking of the PSf coating and new SEI film produced by the electrolyte and the lithium metal was resulted. The results of the EIS measurement confirmed the beneficial effect of the PSf coating on the Li deposition and its intact morphology during repeated plating/stripping process. It is illustrated that the PSf film provided stable electrolyte/electrode interface to allow Li+ ions to transfer through the film and to deposit on the electrode uniformly. As a result, dendritic growth of lithium induced by the uneven electric field distribution was prevented and promoted electrochemical performances were gained. 4 Conclusions Polysulfone (PSf) with high rigid and free-volume cavities of approximately 0.3 nm, was employed to act as a stable interface on the surface of anode, inhibiting the formation of lithium dendrite and limiting side reactions with electrolyte. Dendrite-free morphology of deposited lithium was observed. The promoted performances of Cu|Li cells and steady voltage polarization of Li|Li cells verified beneficial effect of the PSf coating on the Li deposition and the stable electrolyte/electrode interface, allowing Li+ ions to transfer through the film and to deposit on the electrode uniformly. The full cell with PSf coated anode exhibited excellent cyclability (an 85% capacity retention rate over 400 cycles at 1 C) and an outstanding rate capability (117 mAh g− 1 at 5 C). The EIS measurement confirmed the beneficial effect of the PSf coating on the Li deposition and its intact morphology during repeated plating/stripping process, providing stable electrolyte/electrode interface to allow Li+ ions to transfer through the film and to deposit on the electrode uniformly. This work provides a new strategic idea to settle the dendritic problems of Li metal anodes.

        "dc:description": "Lithium metal has been considered to be the most promising anode material for the new generation of energy-storage system. However, challenges still stand in protecting lithium metal from spontaneous reactions with electrolytes and preventing the dendritic propagation, both of which would lead to undesirable decrease in Coulombic efficiency. Polysulfone (PSf) membrane with high rigidity and free-volume cavities of approximately 0.3 nm was employed to provide a stable interface on the surface of anodic electrode. The isotropic channels were constructed by the interconnected and uniformly distributed free volumes in the polymer matrix, and were expected to be swelled by solvent molecules and anions of lithium salt and to allow Li+ ions to pass through onto the electrode surface. As a result, dendrite-free morphology of deposited lithium was observed. The stabilized interface arose from the PSf film was verified by the promoted performances of Cu|Li cells and steady voltage polarization of Li|Li cells. The full cell with PSf coated anode exhibited excellent cyclability (85% capacity retention rate over 400 cycles at 1 C) and an outstanding rate capability (117 mAh g− 1 at 5 C). The beneficial performances were further verified by the EIS results. This work provides a new strategic idea to settle the dendritic problems of Li metal anodes.",
