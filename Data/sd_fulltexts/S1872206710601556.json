DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60155-6 Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene over a MoP Catalyst ZHOU Guilin 1 , WANG Puguang 2 , JIANG Zongxuan 1 , YING Pinliang 1 , LI Can 1, * 1 State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 Shannxi Yanchang Petroleum Co., Ltd., Xiâ€™an 710075, Shannxi, China Abstract: A MoP catalyst was prepared by high temperature hydrogen reduction. Its properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was used for the selective catalytic hydrogenation of acetylene. The results indicated that MoP is formed by hydrogen reduction at 650 Â°C. The prepared MoP catalyst contained high valence molybdenum and phosphorus species. The catalyst is a bifunctional catalyst, which includes a hydrogenation center and an electron-deficient center. Ethylene selectivity can exceed 73% when the acetylene conversion is higher than 99%. Key words: molybdenum phosphide; acetylene; selective hydrogenation; ethylene The ethylene obtained from thermal cracking and steam cracking contains small quantities of acetylene (< 2%), which poisons ethylene polymerization catalysts. The selective hy- drogenation of acetylene has been extensively investigated over Pd and promoted Pd catalysts. However, since the hy- drogenation of acetylene is a series reaction (C 2 H 2 Äº C 2 H 4 Äº C 2 H 6 ), the selectivity for ethylene decreases drastically with increasing acetylene conversion [1â€“3]. Unpromoted Pd cata- lysts have high activity for trace acetylene elimination, while they suffer from low ethylene selectivity at high acetylene conversions. Although most selective hydrogenation of acety- lene studies to date have involved Pd-based systems, other catalysts have also been considered [4â€“6]. However, these studies focused on precious metal catalysts rather than a non-noble metal catalyst. Molybdenum phosphide (MoP) is a new hydrogenation catalyst that has attracted the attention of researchers. Many studies have shown that the MoP catalyst has superior catalytic activity for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [7â€“9] but few studies have paid any attention to their reactivity in other hydrogenation reactions such as acetylene selective catalytic hydrogenation. In this work, MoP was prepared and used for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. Ammonium heptamolybdate (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 Â·4H 2 O was mixed with diammonium hydrogen phosphate (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 in distilled water at a Mo/P molar ratio of 1.0. After the evaporation of water and calcination in air at 500 Â°C for 4 h, the obtained solid was ground to a powder and sieved to 20â€“40 mesh particles. The obtained particles were placed in a quartz reactor and reduced in a temperature con- trolled manner from room temperature to 300 Â°C in 30 min and from 300 to 650 Â°C over 175 min at a rate of 2 Â°C /min in flowing H 2 (~100 ml/min). The final temperature was main- tained for 2 h followed by cooling to room temperature in H 2 . The sample was then passivated at room temperature for 6â€“8 h in a stream of 1%O 2 -99%N 2 . The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained using a Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu K Ä® radiation. In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a KRATOS X-ray source (model VG ESCALAB MK2) with Al K Ä® radiation. The chemical state of Mo and P in the MoP catalyst was acquired by XPS analysis. The hydrogenation of acetylene was evaluated in a con- tinuous flow quartz reactor at ambient pressure. 100 mg of catalyst was pretreated at 600 Â°C in a 90 ml/min flow of hy- drogen for 60 min followed by cooling in H 2 flow to the desired reaction temperature. The feedstock containing 1 vol% acety- lene and 10 vol% hydrogen was balanced with Ar at total flow rate of 60 ml/min and this was controlled by mass flowmeters. ZHOU Guilin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 27â€“30 The reactants and products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a FID and a GS-GASPRO column (30 m Ã— 0.320 mm). The crystal structure of the MoP catalyst prepared in hy- drogen at 650 Â°C for 2 h was examined using XRD and shown in Fig. 1. This figure shows a series of typical peaks at 2È™ = 27.94Â°, 32.08Â°, 43.06Â°, 57.16Â°, 57.74Â°, 64.78Â°, 67.06Â°, 67.58Â°, and 74.12Â°, which can be attributed to the (001), (100), (101), (110), (111), (102), and (201) crystal planes of the MoP phase, respectively. Besides the MoP crystal no other new compounds were detected. The results indicate that the perfect MoP crystal was produced by the reduction of molybdenum phosphate in hydrogen at 650 Â°C. Figure 2 shows in-situ XPS spectra of the MoP catalyst pretreated at 500 Â°C for 60 min in pure hydrogen. The Mo 3d 5/2 peak positions for the catalyst is located at electron binding energies of about 228.0, 229.1, and 232.2 eV, and these are with the same as those of Mo 3+ , Mo Ä¯+ , and Mo 6+ in a multiphase environment. These results are in agreement with previously reported results [10]. Additionally, the P 2p 3/2 peaks were at 129.2 and 133.4 eV, which is with the same as that for the P 3 and P 5+ species, and this is also in agreement with a previous report [11]. The P 3 /P and Mo 3+ /Mo ratios are 0.22 and 0.24, respectively, on the surface of the MoP catalyst and this is based on XPS peak areas. The results show that the Mo 3+ and P 3 species (MoP) can be formed by hydrogen reduction. However, some high valence state molybdenum and phosphorus compounds still exist in the MoP catalyst. The catalytic hydrogenation reaction was investigated at H 2 /C 2 H 2 = 10, a space velocity of 36000 ml/(gÂ·h), and different reaction temperatures for the prepared MoP catalyst. The re- sults are shown in Fig. 3. As show in Fig. 3, the MoP catalyst has good catalytic hydrogenation activity toward acetylene and the conversion reaches 45.2% at 180 Â°C. The main hydro- genation product is ethylene and the selectivity exceeds 77.3%. Acetylene conversion and ethylene selectivity is 99.5% and 73.4% at a reaction temperature of 240 Â°C, respectively. XRD and XPS results indicated that the molybdenum phosphate precursor material can be reduced by hydrogen to form the MoP phase at 650 Â°C over 2 h. The characteristic IR band is attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on the Mo atoms of the MoP surface and is similar to the IR bands at 2040 2060 cm 1 , which corresponds to CO adsorbed on noble metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium [12].
