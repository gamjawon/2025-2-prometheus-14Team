Tel.: +81-6-9638031; fax: +81-6-9638040 Ammonia decomposition proceeds at 300°C over a catalyst consisting of ruthenium metal and CeO2 highly dispersed on Y-form zeolite. The catalyst, Ru-CeO2/YZ, is highly active for NH3 decomposition under conditions at which Y-form zeolite and CeO2 do not work. The decomposition rate is first order in ammonia. The initial rate of nitrogen adsorption supports the decomposition mechanism involving a rate-limiting step in dinitrogen desorption. Moreover, the load of ruthenium particles on CeO2/YZ catalyst makes an inhibition of the decomposition rate by hydrogen less strong. IR spectra for the catalyst indicate that the ammonia decomposition proceeds via the formation of the intermediate species, such as RuNH3, RuNH2, RuN2 and RuH on the surface of ruthenium. The adsorption of hydrogen and XRD data support the idea that ruthenium is highly dispersed in the Ru-CeO2/YZ Keywords Ruthenium metal Cerium oxides Y-form zeolite 1 Introduction Cerium oxides possess unique features, such as stabilization of noble metal dispersion [1–5] and ability to improve hydrogen poisoning [6–8]. This oxide has been used as catalytic support to promote dinitrogen activation or ammonia synthesis [9–11], which is very important as basic chemicals and raw materials for synthetic fertilizer It is, therefore, important to improve the catalytic properties of the oxide. The decomposition and synthesis of ammonia have played important roles in the development of a large number of kinetic principles and so the studies on the decomposition should give a pointer to improve synthetic ammonia catalyst. In addition, the decomposition of ammonia exhausted in the atmosphere is essential to avoid an environmental pollution, for example, ammonia is generated very often on treating sewage and activated sludge. The fine particles of a catalytic material have been frequently used to improve its catalytic properties [12–22]. We have reported that small particles of CeO2 incorporated into zeolite cavities are highly activated and accelerates the oxidation of alkyl benzene [23]. In this paper, we report (1) preparation of ruthenium and CeO2 highly dispersed in Y-form zeolite, (2) high activity for ammonia decomposition, (3) adsorption species on the surface of ruthenium. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemicals were analytical grade commercial materials and used without further purification. The protonated form Y-form zeolite was supplied by the Catalyst Reference Committee of the Japan Catalysis Society. Nitrogen and hydrogen gas (more than 99.9%) were purified according to a usual method, and then dried at 77K over a molecular sieve (4Å). 2.2 Preparation of CeO2/YZ catalyst Small particles of cerium oxide supported on Y-form zeolite, CeO2/YZ, are prepared by the method similar to that reported earlier [23]. 2.3 Preparation of Ru-CeO2/YZ catalyst Ruthenium trichloride hydrate (1g=0.004mol) was dissolved in 5ml of distilled water in a 200ml beaker and then 10ml of 85mol% hydrazine solution was added drop wise carefully at room temperature to the well-stirred ruthenium solution. The solution was stirred for 20h at room temperature with a magnetic stirrer and then was filtered by a glass filter. The filtered solution contains a mixture of hexaammineruthenium(II) and pentaammine(nitrogen)ruthenium(II) ions [24]. Large quantity of ammonia gas formed by the decomposition of hydrazine was evolved in vacuo. The solution was evaporated in vacuo at 65°C till the volume of the solution became about 2ml. The evaporation procedures changed the solution from chocolate-brown to wine-red; [Ru(NH3)5(N2)]2+ yellow, [Ru(NH3)5Cl]2+ yellow, [Ru(NH3)5(OH)]2+ wine-red [24]. The wine-red solution was diluted to 100ml with distilled water. The CeO2/YZ (2g) was placed in 100ml of the wine-red solution in a 200ml Erlenmeyer flask. The CeO2/YZ was impregnated for 12h at 65°C in the wine-red solution. The impregnation changed the CeO2/YZ slurry from pale yellow to wine-red. The wine-red slurry was filtered, washed several times with 500ml of deionized water, and dried at 100°C for 5h. A dark gray powder was obtained. The dark gray powder was evacuated at 400°C until no ammonia gas was desorbed. The sample changed dark gray to black. The chemical composition of the Ru-CeO2/YZ was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The contents of SiO2, Al2O3, CeO2 and Ru were determined to be 64.0, 19.5, 10.2 and 1.9wt.%, respectively. 2.4 Decomposition of ammonia The catalyst (0.020g) was placed in a constant volume of a glass tubular reactor that is connected to a vacuum line and pressure gages (MKS Baratron type 627A11TBC and 622A13TBE). The reactor is a closed system without circulation; the inner diameter of the tubular reactor is 6mm and reactor volume is 83ml. The sample was pretreated in vacuo for 3h at 400°C and then exposed at a fixed temperature to 2–4kPa of NH3. The decomposition rate was determined on the basis of a reactor volume and an increase in reaction pressure resulting from ammonia decomposition: 2NH 3→N 2+3H 2 2.5 X-ray measurements XRD patterns of the samples were recorded using a Mac-Science 18 spectrometer (Ni-Filtered Cu Kα, 40kV, 50mA). The samples were mounted on sample boards and the measurements were carried out immediately. 2.6 Chemisorption of nitrogen and hydrogen The amount of nitrogen chemisorption at 0°C and the rate of nitrogen chemisorption at 300, 330 and 350°C were measured under a desired pressure of nitrogen using a Magnetic Suspension Balance-Low Pressure (Rubotherm Prazisionsmesstechnik Ghbh). The sample was pretreated in vacuo for 2h at 400°C. The sample was then reduced for 30min at 300°C with 15kPa of hydrogen and evacuated for 1h at 350°C to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and adsorbed water prior to nitrogen adsorption at 0, 300, 330 and 350°C under a desired pressure of nitrogen. The amount of hydrogen chemisorption at 0°C at 1.55kPa of hydrogen and the rate of hydrogen chemisorption at 300°C at 9kPa of hydrogen were also measured using the apparatus as described above. The other procedures were the same as described above. 2.7 FTIR measurements FTIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 8100 FTIR spectrometer using a conventional IR cell connected to a vacuum line and adsorption apparatus. The catalyst (0.001g) was compressed at 7.5toncm−2 using a pellet die to form a circular disk with a 3mm diameter. All samples were pretreated in vacuo for 3h at 400°C before the FTIR measurements. The sample was exposed at 300°C to NH3 gas under 0.10kPa of NH3. The FTIR measurements were carried out at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The decomposition rates of NH3 were measured at 300, 320, 330 and 350°C under nitrogen pressure of 2–4kPa and determined using an increase in reaction pressure due to decomposition. The time-on-stream variation in the partial pressure of NH3 for the decomposition of NH3 at different temperature is shown in Fig. 1 . Y-form zeolite and CeO2 have no decomposition activity under the conditions. The logarithmic partial pressure of NH3 falls in proportion to reaction time. The result indicates that the decomposition rate is first order in partial pressure of NH3 and hydrogen has little effect on the decomposition rate below 320°C. The small deviation at 330 and 350°C from a straight for the reaction time higher than 10min are additionally due to small variations in the pressure of NH3 resulting from incomplete diffusion of NH3 in the slender reaction. The initial rates of nitrogen adsorption on the bare surface of the catalyst were measured at 300, 330 and 350°C under nitrogen pressure of 2.0 and 7.0kPa, and the results were shown in Table 2 . The initial rate corresponds to the decomposition rate at the same temperature in Fig. 1. The decomposition rate and initial rate of nitrogen chemisorption are both of the same order of magnitude, 10−5 molmin−1 g-cat−1. In addition, the equilibrium adsorption of hydrogen was instantaneously attained on introducing hydrogen at 300°C. The initial rate of hydrogen chemisorption on the bare surface is more than 6.0×10−3 molmin−1 g-cat−1 at 9kPa of hydrogen. These results support the decomposition mechanism involving a rate-limiting step in nitrogen desorption. The ammonia decomposition and its reverse reaction generally involve a rate-limiting step in dinitrogen desorption [25–27]. The decomposition rates (ν d) under the pressure of ∼100kPa are often fitted by (1a) ν d =k′(P NH 3 )n or (2a) ν d = k(P NH 3 ) [1+K(P NH 3 )] where k, k′, K and n (0≦n≦1) are constants [28–32]. In the expressions, (P NH3 ) represents a partial pressure of ammonia. Eq. (3a) is derived by substituting n=1 in Eq. (1a) or 1⪢K(P NH3 ) for denominator term in Eq. (2a). ν d =k′(P NH 3 ) or ν d =k(P NH 3 ) (3a) ν d =k d (P NH 3 ) where k d is a constant. The reaction is generally zero order in N2 and H2, first order in NH3, and can be inhibited by NH3 [32]. The observations are reasonably fitted by Eq. (3a). Ammonia synthesis over Ru powder [25] and Ru supported on X-form zeolite [33] is limited by nitrogen adsorption and strongly inhibited by hydrogen; decreasing the H2 content down to 650ppm does not suffice to make the inhibition disappear. In the Ru-CeO2/YZ, little inhibition effect of hydrogen on the rate has been observed as described above. It is reasonably considered that the load of ruthenium particles on CeO2/YZ significantly makes the inhibition effect by hydrogen less strong. A similar decrease of the inhibition by hydrogen has been reported for the catalytic reaction [8,27,34,35]. The decomposition rate in the Ru-CeO2/YZ, 5×10−2 μmols−1 g-cat−1 at 350°C under 2.8kPa of NH3, is higher by 100 times than that, 5×10−4 μmols−1 g-cat−1 at 440°C under 21kPa of NH3, in highly active catalyst reported by Oyama [31], because the former decomposition rate is first order in ammonia and the later one is zero order. The Arrhenius plots of the rate constant are represented in Fig. 2 on the basis of the data in Fig. 1. The Arrhenius plots lies near a straight line. The apparent activation energy is determined to be 16kcalmol−1. The activation energy for dinitrogen adsorption on a variety of supported Ru catalysts, including Ru/Al2O3, Ru/MgO, and Ru/CsMgO, ranged from 61kJmol−1 to 33kJmol−1 [36]. Assuming the decomposition involving a rate-limiting step in nitrogen desorption, the value (16kcalmol−1) is reasonable as activation energy for nitrogen desorption, because the value is equal to the sum of the activation energies for nitrogen adsorption and heat of nitrogen adsorption. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded and shown in Fig. 3 . X-ray diffraction patterns for the Ru-CeO2/YZ is well in accordance with those for Y-form zeolite [37] except the broad peaks at 2θ=28.6°, 33.1°, 47 5° and 56.4°. The catalyst maintains the structure of Y-form zeolite. No diffraction pattern resulting from ruthenium metal suggests high dispersion of ruthenium in the zeolite. The X-ray diffraction peaks, resulting from a cubic crystal structure of CeO2, appear in the range of 2θ=28.6° (III), 33.1° (200), 47 5° (220) and 56.4° (311); their relative intensities are 100, 30, 52 and 42, respectively. 1 Powder Diffraction File Inorganic Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS, International Center for Diffraction Data, JCPDS 34-394. 1 We had already reported that small particles of CeO2 incorporated into the mordenite cavities, CeO2/Mordenite, were prepared by a hydrolysis of cerium ions with a moist ammonia gas [23]. The CeO2/YZ was prepared by the same procedures as those of the CeO2/Mordenite except the use of Y-form zeolite [23]. The broad peaks are attributed to the small crystal size of CeO2 highly dispersed on Y-form zeolite. FTIR spectra were measured for the Ru-CeO2/YZ and shown in Figs. 4–6 . As shown in Fig. 4, bands at 1618∼3, 1520 and 1454cm−1 were observed. Coordinated and adsorbed ammonia display the bands, resulting from NH2 or NH bending, in the region of 1650–1515cm−1. IR absorption, arising from NH bending vibration of NH3 coordinated to ruthenium, occurs in the range of 1634–1605cm−1 [38], whereas arising from that of NH3 chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites and Brönsted acid sites, occurs the band at 1620cm−1 and around 1400cm−1, respectively [39]. On MgO catalyst, the intermediate species of ammonia synthesis, such as NH(a), NH2(a), and NH3(a), results in bands at 1410, 1550 and 1610cm−1, respectively [40]. The band at 1643cm−1 was observed for the Y-form zeolite, but the Y-form zeolite scarcely displays bands in the range of 1600–1200cm−1. The bands at 1618–3cm−1 can attribute to NH bending vibration due to ammonia coordinated to ruthenium and/or chemisorbed on Lewis acid sites in the Ru-CeO2/YZ. The band 1520cm−1 is attributable to the bending vibration of NH in NH2 species. The band at 1454cm−1 is attributable to the bending vibration of NH due to NH4 + bonded with Brönsted acid sites, because an increase in decomposition time scarcely influences on the intensity of the band. As shown in Fig. 5, the bands at 3389, 3375 (with a shoulder at 3337cm−1), 3310 and 3270cm−1 (with a shoulder 3192cm−1), were observed on adsorption of NH3 at 300°C. The stretching vibration of NH in ruthenium ammine complexes displays the bands around 3100–3375cm−1 [38]. The ruthenium ammine complexes display three bands, resulting from the stretching vibration of NH3; [Ru(NH3)5N2)Br 3300cm−1 (with a shoulder at about 3230 and 3180cm−1); [Ru(NH3)5N2](BF4)2 3370, 3310, 3230cm−1; [Ru(NH3)5N2](PF6)2 3375, 3306, 3225cm−1 [38]. IR absorption, arising from NH vibration, gives the bands at 3444, 3337, 1627, around 950cm−1 for NH3 and 3380, 3290, 1610cm−1 for the adsorption species of NH2, NH2(a) and 3200cm−1 for the adsorption species of NH, NH(a) [39,41]. Bands at 3399cm−1 (with a shoulder around 3390cm−1), 3318 and 3270cm−1 are observed for the Y-form zeolite (Fig. 7 ). The band at 3375cm−1 with a shoulder around 3340cm−1 and the shoulder at 3192cm−1 appear in the presence of ruthenium and CeO2. Though IR absorption, arising from the symmetric stretching vibration of NH3 gas, shows a band at 3337cm−1 [39], the shoulder around 3340cm−1 remains after 1min evacuation at room temperature. Furthermore, in the FTIR measurements, the bands due to NH3 in gas phase are canceled out by difference spectrum. Therefore, the bands at 3375 (with a shoulder around 3340cm−1), about 3310 and 3192cm−1 are attributable to the symmetric stretching vibration of NH3 coordinated to ruthenium. The increase in decomposition time results in a blue shift of the stretching vibration at 3375 and 3310cm−1. Furthermore, the evacuation at room temperature results in a red shift of their bands (Fig. 5d). The results indicate the existence of some adsorption species that have a different strength of a bond between their species and adsorption sites. The results are hence explainable in terms of a multiformity in the active sites: ammonia decomposition rapidly and mainly occurs in the more active sites, but slowly in less active ones. The bond strength between NH2(a) and the more active sites is stronger than that in the less active sites, that is, the electron density of H2NRu bond with the more active sites is higher than that with the less active sites. In the more active sites, the higher density of electron in the H2NRu bond may be attributable to decreasing influence of the electron density of HN bond. This decrease gives a red shift of stretching vibration of HN bond. The lower frequency bands due to the intermediate bonded with more active sites, thus, are observed in the initial reaction stage and at an evacuation, whereas the rather high frequency one due to the intermediate on less active sites is observed after a long reaction time. Therefore, the difference between the more active and less active sites is believed to be due to different location of ruthenium particles in the inner and on the outer surface of the zeolite. The bands at ca. 2225, 1985, 1973, 1960, 1950 and 1894cm−1 were observed for the Ru-CeO2/YZ (Fig. 6), whereas these bands were not recognized for Y-form zeolite which is inactive for the decomposition. IR absorption, arising from the stretching vibration of RuH, shows bands in the range of 2000–1880cm−1, resulting from on-top, and side-on type adsorption [42–44]. IR absorption, arising from the stretching frequency of dinitrogen molecules adsorbed on ruthenium, bands in the range of 2240–2020cm−1 [11,42,45]. The intensity of the band around 2225cm−1 decreases on evacuation at room temperature for 1min, and the band simultaneously shifts to lower frequency. The band around 2225cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of dinitrogen molecules formed by the decomposition of ammonia. A similar shift, resulting from the adsorption of nitrogen on the multiform active sites, has been observed for the stretching vibration of NN bonding with ruthenium [11,46]. The bands at 1985, 1973, 1960, 1950 and 1894cm−1 are attributed to the stretching frequency of RuH in the on-top type adsorption. The intensities of the bands increase with an increase in decomposition time (Fig. 6b and c). The evacuation at room temperature results in a decrease of the intensity of the bands due to RuH (Fig. 6d). The band at 1942 and 1960cm−1 remain after the evacuation. The results are explainable in terms of the same explanation of frequency shift at 3375 and 3310cm−1 as described above: ammonia decomposition rapidly occurs in the more active sites, but slowly in less active ones. The hydrogen species strongly bonded with the more active sites may give the lower frequency bands, because the adsorption ability of the active sites depends on a shift quantity from 2000cm−1 [42,43]. These results substantiate the proposal that the active sites in the Ru-CeO2/YZ have certain multiformity. A similar shift due to a multiformity in the active sites has been observed for the stretching vibration of RuH in the ruthenium catalysts [42,43]. The amount of nitrogen chemisorption was measured at 0°C under 3.25kPa of nitrogen and was determined to be 1.6×10−5 molg-cat−1. Similarly, the amount of hydrogen chemisorption was measured at 0°C under 1.55kPa of hydrogen. The amount is determined to be 4.2×10−5 molg-cat−1 at 0°C even under 1.55kPa of hydrogen which is half a pressure of nitrogen. No hydrogen is chemisorbed on the CeO2/YZ under the same conditions. On the other hand, the amount of the supported ruthenium is calculated to be 1.8×10−4 molg-cat−1=0.019/101.007 from the chemical composition in Table 1 and an atomic mass of ruthenium. Assuming that hydrogen atom bonds with one ruthenium atom and hydrogen coverage is 100%, the number of the adsorption sites of dissociative hydrogen possesses 46%=(4.2×10−5)×2×100/1.8×104 of the amount of the supported ruthenium, that is, the number of surface ruthenium atoms is 5.1×1017 atoms g-cat−1=4.2×10−5×2×6.02/1023. The former value, 46%, indicates that the ratio of surface Ru atoms to bulky Ru atoms is 46/54. The average size of Ru particles is calculated to be ca. 2nm on the basis of the ratio, closest packing and atomic radius of Ru. Similarly, the number of nitrogen adsorption sites at 0°C under 3.25kPa of nitrogen possess 9%=(1.6×10−5)×100/1.8×10−4 of the amount of the supported ruthenium. The difference between the amount of hydrogen- and nitrogen-adsorption is probably due to lower nitrogen coverage under the conditions. The results indicate that small particles of ruthenium are highly dispersed in the CeO2/YZ. 4 Conclusion The catalyst consisting of ruthenium and CeO2 highly dispersed on Y-form zeolite have been prepared. The Ru-CeO2/YZ is highly active for NH3 decomposition under the conditions at which Y-form zeolite and CeO2 don’t work. The decomposition rate is first order in ammonia and hydrogen has little effect on the decomposition rate below 320°C. The initial rate of nitrogen chemisorption on the bare surface corresponds to the decomposition rate at the same temperature. The initial chemisorption rate and decomposition one are both of the same order of magnitude, 10−5 molmin−1 g-cat−1, whereas the initial rate of hydrogen chemisorption on the bare surface is far faster than the decomposition one. The results support the decomposition mechanism involving a rate-limiting step in nitrogen desorption. The load of ruthenium particles on the CeO2/YZ makes the inhibition by hydrogen less strong. The observations are reasonably fitted by Eq. (3a) derived by substituting n=1 in Eq. (1a) or 1⪢K(P NH3 ) for denominator term in Eq. (2a). The apparent activation energy is determined to be 16kcalmol−1. Assuming the decomposition involving a rate-limiting step in nitrogen desorption, the value (16kcalmol−1) is reasonable as activation energy for nitrogen desorption. The adsorption of NH3 gives the band at 1520cm−1 which is attributable to the bending vibration of NH in NH2 species. In addition, the adsorption gives the band at 2225cm−1 and the bands at 1985, 1973, 1960, 1950 and 1894cm−1: the former band is attributable to the stretching vibration of NN bonding with ruthenium and the later ones are attributed to the stretching frequency of RuH in the on-top type adsorption. These results indicate that the decomposition of NH3 at 300°C proceeds via a generation of RuNH2, RuH and RuN2 species. The ammonia decomposition hence occurs on the ruthenium surface. The adsorption of hydrogen and XRD data support the idea that small particles of ruthenium are highly dispersed in the Ru-CeO2/YZ.
