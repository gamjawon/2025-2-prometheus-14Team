Graphical abstract Three different Fe doping strategies were studied to explore the influence in both the formed kinds of active sites and ORR/Mg-air batteries’ performance. Fe/N/C catalysts, synthesized through the pyrolysis of Fe-doped metal–organic framework (MOF) precursors, have attracted extensive attention owing to their promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity in fuel cells and/or metal-air batteries. However, post-treatments (acid washing, second pyrolysis, and so on) are unavoidable to improve ORR catalytic activity and stability. The method for introducing Fe3+ sources (anhydrous FeCl3) into the MOF structure, in particular, is a critical step that can avoid time-consuming post-treatments and result in more exposed Fe-N x active sites. Herein, three different Fe doping strategies were systematically investigated to explore their influence on the types of active sites formed and ORR performance. Fe-NC(Zn2+), synthesized by one-step pyrolysis of Fe doped ZIF-8 (Zn2+) precursor which was obtained by adding the anhydrous FeCl3 source into the Zn(NO3)2•6H2O/methanol solution before mixing, possessed the highest Fe-N x active sites due to the high-efficiency substitution of Zn2+ ions with Fe3+ ions during ZIF-8 growth, the strong interaction between Fe3+ ions and N atoms of 2-Methylimidazole (2-MIm), and ZIF-8′s micropore confinement effect. As a result, Fe-NC(Zn2+) presented high ORR activity in the entire pH range (pH = 1, 7, and 13). At pH = 13, Fe-NC(Zn2+) exhibited a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.95 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), which was 70 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C. More importantly, Fe-NC(Zn2+) showed superior ORR stability in neutral media without performance loss after 5,000 cycles. A record-high open-circuit voltage (1.9 V) was obtained when Fe-NC(Zn2+) was used as a cathodic catalyst in assembled Mg-air batteries in neutral media. The assembled liquid and all-solid Mg-air batteries with high performance indicated that Fe-NC(Zn2+) has enormous potential for use in flexible and wearable Mg-air batteries.

Metal-air batteries, especially Zinc-air batteries applied in alkaline media, have received significant attentions owing to their high energy capacities, great flexibility and so on [1–4]. However, corrosive alkaline electrolyte of Zinc-air batteries hinders their widespread application in wearable devices. Mg-air batteries applied in neutral electrolytes have been demonstrated as power systems owing to their high stability and bio-compatibility [5–7]. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the air cathode limits their widespread application in recent years [8–10]. At present, enormous efforts have been made on non-precious metal catalysts to replace platinum group metal catalysts with high cost, limited resource availability and poor stability [11–13]. In particular, zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF)-derived transition metal (M)/N/C catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their high N content and numerous micropores that originated from ZIF. Notably, ZIF-derived Fe/N/C catalysts have outperformed several non-precious metal catalysts, such as Co/N/C, Mn/N/C, and Cu/N/C [14–18]. Researchers have attempted to synthesize ZIF-derived Fe/N/C catalysts with more exposed atomic FeN4 active sites in recent years. It has been demonstrated that the doping strategy of Fe played significant role in forming the Fe-N x structure [19–23]. Typically, Fe sources were doped in ZIF by a post-absorption method or replacing the sites of Zn2+ ions with Fe3+ ions during ZIF growth. The number of Fe-N x active sites obtained in various studies varied even though their synthetic methods seemed similar. However, few studies focus on whether or not different Fe doping strategies will cause different active sites and ORR performance of catalysts. Besides, few study focuses on the activities and application of catalysts in neutral conditions. Thus, establishing the relationship between the existing form of Fe3+ ions in ZIF precursors and the formation of Fe-N x active sites in final catalysts is still challenging. Herein, ZIF-8 with rich N content and micropores was used as a precursor to investigate the influence of three different Fe doping strategies on the type and number of active sites of Fe-NC obtained catalysts after pyrolysis. The optimized catalyst, denoted as Fe-NC(Zn2+) which was synthesized by directly mixing an Fe source with Zn(NO3)2 in a methanol solution, exhibited the most number of Fe–N x active sites owing to the high-efficiency substitution of Zn2+ ions with Fe3+ ions during ZIF-8 growth. Besides, Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst achieved high ORR activity in the entire pH range (pH = 1, 7, and 13), especially with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.95 V (vs. RHE) at pH = 13. More importantly, Fe-NC(Zn2+) showed superior ORR stability in neutral media, where E 1/2 (0.62 V) was still retained after 5,000 cycles at 0.6–1.0 V (vs. RHE). Fe-NC(Zn2+) also showed a record-high open-circuit voltage (1.9 V) when it was used as a cathodic catalyst in neutral assembled Mg-air batteries, implying that it has great potential for usage in flexible and wearable Mg-air batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of ZIF-8 / Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) / Fe doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) / Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) 6.560 g of 2-Methylimidazole was dissolved in of 200 mL methanol (referred as “Solution A”). Then, 2.976 g of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O was dissolved in 200 mL of methanol (referred as “Solution B”). Later, a mixed solution which was obtained by quickly pouring “Solution B” to “Solution A” was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the white suspension was centrifugated at 10,000 r/min for 6 min, washed with methanol for three times and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h. The obtained white powders were ZIF-8. To prepare Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8), all of the obtained ZIF-8 powders were dispersed to 400 mL of methanol, then 16.22 mg of anhydrous FeCl3 was added to the solution and stirred at room temperature for another 1 h. Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) precursor was connected by centrifugation without washing. Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) / Fe doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) were prepared by the same synthetic method as ZIF-8 expect the introduction of Fe3+ source (FeCl3). 16.22 mg of anhydrous FeCl3 was added to solution B before mixing A and B for preparing Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+), while it was added to solution A for preparing Fe doped ZIF-8(2-MIm). 2.1.2 Preparation of Fe-NC(Zn2+) / Fe-NC(2-MIm) / Fe-NC(ZIF-8) catalyst The Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) / Fe doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) / Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) precursors were respectively annealed at 1050 °C for 1 h in a furnace with a nitrogen flow (heat rate: 5 °C/min). The black powders obtained after naturally cooling was marked as Fe-NC(Zn2+)/Fe-NC(2-MIm)/Fe-NC(ZIF-8) catalyst, respectively. 2.2 Electrochemical measurement The ORR half-cell performance of all the catalysts were performed on a CHI760D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) coupled with a rotating instrument (PINE, USA). A conventional three electrode system, consisting of a graphite rod (counter electrode), a silver chloride reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, AgCl + e- ↔ Ag + Cl-, saturated KCl concentration, reference electrode) and a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, 5 mm, working electrode, disk material: glassy carbon, ring material: Pt) or rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE, 5.6 mm, working electrode), was used for the electrochemical measurements. To prepare catalyst film, 5 mg of the as-prepared sample was weighed and added to 1 mL solution containing 960 μL of 2-propanol and 40 μL of Nafion (5 wt%). After 1 h dispersion by ultrasonication, the homogeneous ink was dropped on the surface of a RDE or RRDE electrode with a pipette gun until the catalyst loading reached to 0.8 mg/cm2. The commercial Pt/C catalyst (Johnson Matthey, 20 wt%) was used for comparison (Pt loading: 40 μgPt/cm2). The ORR activity was evaluated in 0.1 M HClO4 (pH = 1), 0.1 M NaCl (pH = 7) and 0.1 M KOH (pH = 13) aqueous electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, 10 mV/s) was conducted after stable cyclic voltammetry (CV, 100 mV/s) curve was obtained. All the LSV curves were calibrated with background and ionic resistance. Accelerated durability test was conducted at a potential range from 0.6 V to 1.0 V for 5000 cycles (100 mV/s) in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte. ECSA was determined by the following equation (1) [24]:. (1) E C S A = C D L C s where Cs is the specific capacitance of the sample or the capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface of the material per unit area. CDL is the electrochemical double-layer capacitance. CVs for all samples were tested in 0.1 M KOH with scan rate of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mV/s. 2.3 Materials characterization The crystal structure of all the samples was determined by the power X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Cu Kα, 5°/min, 10°-80°). A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Fei Nova nano 450) was applied to investigate the surface morphology of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were conducted on a Talos-F200X microscope and aberration-corrected STEM were conducted on FEI Titan 80–300 electron microscope operating at 300 kV. A Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer (Autosorb IQ) was used to determine the specific surface area and the pore size distribution of all the samples (degas temperature: 120 °C, 3 h). The near-surface element composition and chemical environment of all the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). Raman spectra were obtained by a microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (Labram HR800 Evolution, 532 nm). The electronic state and environment of the precursors was evaluated by electron spin-resonance spectroscopy (EPR, ELEXSYS E500, Bruker). The Fe content was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) method. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted on the beam line of 11B station of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The Fe K-edge spectra of all the samples were recorded under fluorescence mode except for the Fe foil was transmission mode. The XAS data were analyzed by the Athena and Artemis software. 2.4 Mg-air battery fabrication and test Liquid Mg-air batteries were assembled and tested in a home-made electrochemical cell. Catalysts uniformly loaded onto a commercial carbon paper with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) gas diffusion layer (area: 1 cm2, catalysts’ loading: 1 mg/cm2 for Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Pt/C) was used as the air cathode. A polished Mg sheet was used as the anode. The electrolyte was 10 wt% NaCl aqueous solution. LSV curves were conducted until a stable open circuit voltage was obtained. The rate performance of the battery was evaluated by step constant current discharge curve. The solid flexible electrolyte was the LiCl/ polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel, which obtained by dissolving 6.0 g PVA powders and 8.5 g LiCl into 40 mL deionized water [5]. The all-solid Mg-Air battery was assembled as the following protocol. A polished Mg sheet was applied as anode, and then the LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte was cast onto its surface, subsequently the carbon cloth with loaded catalyst (catalysts loading: 1 mg/cm2) was placed on the Mg sheet with gel electrolyte. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and structure characterization As depicted in Scheme 1 , three different Fe doping strategies were used to explore the relationship between the existing environment of Fe3+ in Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursors and the formation of Fe-N x active sites in the ultimate catalysts. The doping methods are as follow: (1) an Fe source was mixed with a Zn(NO3)2 methanol solution in advance, (2) an Fe source was mixed with a 2-Methylimidazole (2-MIm) methanol solution in advance, and (3) an Fe source was introduced into the ZIF-8 pore structure by a post-absorption method. All added orders poured the Zn2+-based methanol solution (with/without Fe source) into the 2-MIm based methanol solution (with/without Fe source). Different Fe-NC catalysts were synthesized through a short-time (1 h) pyrolysis without any post-treatment, such as acid washing or the second pyrolysis. For the Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst, anhydrous FeCl3 was uniformly mixed with the Zn(NO3)2 methanol solution in advance, and then, the mixed solution was poured quickly into the 2-MIm methanol solution to grow the Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) precursor, where the Fe3+ ions will partly substitute the Zn2+ ions in the framework structure of ZIF-8 (Scheme 1a). The Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst was obtained after the pyrolysis of the Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) precursor at 1050 °C under flowing N2 gas. There were no post-treatments for Fe-NC(Zn2+), such as acid washing and/or the second pyrolysis. It is worth mentioning that the entire synthetic procedure of the Fe-NC catalysts shortened the time significantly owing to the short synthetic period of the Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor (only 1 h), and no post-treatments were needed after pyrolysis. For comparison, as illustrated in Scheme 1b-c, the other two Fe-NC catalysts were synthesized using the same procedures as Fe-NC(Zn2+), but with different doping strategies. The dosage of FeCl3 used in these three different kinds of doping strategies was kept constant to ensure the comparability of experiments. More prepared details are provided in the experimental section. The precursor of the Fe-NC(2-MIm) catalyst was Fe doped ZIF-8(2-MIm), which was obtained by pouring the Zn(NO3)2 methanol solution into a pre-prepared methanol solution containing FeCl3 and 2-MIm. In this way, Fe3+ ions are acknowledged to coordinate with 2-MIm, and the products, Fe x (2-MIm) y complex (denoted as Fe-MIm), would be generated in the pre-prepared FeCl3/2-MIm methanol solution, making it difficult for Fe3+ ions to replace Zn2+ ions in the ZIF-8 structure due to the larger size of the coordinated Fe-MIm complex than Fe3+ ion [25]. The precursors of the Fe-NC(ZIF-8) catalyst, namely, Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8), were obtained by first synthesizing the pure ZIF-8 and subsequently introducing FeCl3 into the inner structure of ZIF-8 by a post-adsorption method. In this way, Fe3+ ions were easily diffused into the micropores of pure ZIF-8, resulting in less interaction with 2-MIm. SEM was used to determine whether the three different kinds of Fe doping strategies have a significant difference in the surface morphology and size of the three obtained Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursors. In Fig. 1 (a-c), nearly dodecahedral-like morphology as that of pure ZIF-8 (Fig. S1) was found in the three precursors. In addition, the average particle size was approximately 50 ± 5 nm for ZIF-8, Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm), and Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) precursors, whereas that of Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) was approximately 78 nm (Table S1). It is a common phenomenon that Fe doping brings about a larger ZIF crystal size [20,26], as attributed to the pH change in the Zn(NO3)2 methanol solution after the addition of FeCl3 which would hydrolyze (a small amount of water exists in methanol) [27]. In principle, crystal sizes are decided by the relative rates between seed nucleation and growth. The nucleation of ZIF-8 was formed by coordinating deprotonated 2-dimethylimidazole with zinc ions. The pH changes caused by the hydrolysis of iron ions inhibit the deprotonation of 2-dimethylimidazole, thus slowing down the formation of the crystal nucleus. Less nucleus can grow into larger particles more easily. Fig. 1(d) shows that there was a negligible difference in the nitrogen isotherm curves of the three Fe-doped precursors compared to that of ZIF-8. The specific surface areas were 1362, 1371, 1330, and 1669 m2/g for ZIF-8, Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8), Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm), and Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) precursors, respectively. Furthermore, their pore distributions were dominated by micropores with an average pore size of approximately 0.54 nm (Fig. 1e). The pore structure and specific surface area of ZIF-8 were not changed by the introduction of Fe3+ ions using the post-adsorption method. The above results elucidate that different doping strategies had prominent effects on the morphology and interior structure of the above precursors. The crystal structures of three precursors were characterized by powder XRD. As shown in Fig. 1(f), all precursors retained their characteristic diffraction peaks of pure ZIF-8 [28–30]. Two diffraction peaks at approximately 7° and 13° (heart symbol) correspond to the (011) and (112) crystal planes of ZIF-8, respectively. However, for Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) precursor, the intensity ratio of (011)/(112) planes changed to less than 1 compared with that of ZIF-8 (more than 1), and the intensity of diffraction peaks at approximately 16° and 18° (club symbol) were significantly enhanced. Notably, Fe-MIm, namely, the complex formed by the coordination of Fe3+ ions with 2-MIm, exhibited a wide diffraction peak from 10° to 40° (Fig. S2), demonstrating that the intensity difference of peaks at approximately 7°-18° for the Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) precursor was due to the existence of Fe-MIm in ZIF-8 and demonstrating that Fe3+ ions in ZIF-8 were in the form of the coordinated Fe-MIm complex [25]. The Fe3+ electronic environment of the three precursors probably is different. EPR and XAS were used to provide a deeper insight into the coordinated environment of Fe3+ ions. Fig. 1(h) shows a dominated peak at 7119.4 eV that was different from Fe foil in all three Fe-doped precursors. In addition, a dominant peak located at 1.41 Å, assigned to the scattering of Fe-N bond, could be seen in all three Fe-doped precursors, elucidating that Fe3+ ions were coordinated with the N atoms of 2-MIm for these three Fe-doped precursors (Fig. 1i) [31–33]. However, in Fig. 1(g), identical and periodic sine-like curves could be seen in both the EPR spectroscopy of Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) and Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm). The appeared sine-like curves are related to the unpaired electrons excited by coordination between Fe3+ and 2-methylimidazole. However, the curve with no signal could be seen in that of Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8), illustrating that Fe3+ ions in Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) were not doped in the framework of ZIF-8 in the form of coordination [34–36]. Based on the XRD, EPR, and XAS results, it can be concluded that Fe3+ ions were doped in Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) through the substitution toward Zn2+ ions, whereas they were doped in Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) through Fe-2-MIm. For Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8), Fe3+ ions exist in the pore structure of ZIF-8. XPS and ICP-OES were performed to identify the kinds of elements and Fe content of the three different Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursors. In Fig. S3, strong photoelectron peaks belonging to C, O, N, and Zn elements appeared in these three precursors, whereas weak photoelectron peaks belonging to the Fe element could be found in high-resolution Fe 2p XPS, implying that the Fe element was successfully doped in ZIF-8. In addition, the Fe contents of three precursors obtained by ICP measurement are shown in Table S2. The Fe-doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) precursor showed the highest Fe content (0.39 wt%) than Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) and Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) with 0.30 and 0.05 wt%, respectively. On the other hand, the Fe content of the Fe-doped ZIF-8(2-MIm) precursor was approximately 6–8 times lower than the other two precursors. Notably, as shown in Table S2, the Fe content on the near-surface of the three Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursors was nearly identical to 0.09 at%, which elucidated that most Fe species were dispersed in the interior structure of ZIF-8 for the Fe doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) and Fe doped ZIF-8(ZIF-8) precursor. Although Fe3+ ion would interact with 2-MIm during the synthesis of Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+), most 2-MIm tend to coordinate with Zn2+ ions and grow ZIF-8 due to the high Zn2+ concentration, and thus, the generation of Fe-MIm will be prevented. The above XPS and ICP results suggest that Fe3+ ions could easily interact with ZIF-8 through post-adsorption or replacement with Zn2+ ions, and it was difficult for Fe-MIm ions to enter the interior structure of ZIF-8 due to their larger size than Fe3+ ions. After one-step pyrolysis at 1050 °C for 1 h, the crystal structures of the three obtained catalysts were characterized by XRD. In Fig. 2 (a), two diffraction peaks belonging to the (002) and (101) plane of graphitic carbon are found in Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm). However, apart from the graphitic carbon diffraction peak at approximately 26.4°, other diffraction peaks belonging to the (Fe, C), Fe, and FeO phases were found in Fe-NC(ZIF-8) although its Fe content of precursor (0.39 wt%) is comparable to that (0.30 wt%) of Fe-NC(Zn2+), illustrating that it was easy to occur Fe aggregation by the method in which the Fe3+ source was introduced by the post-absorption treatment of pure ZIF-8 toward FeCl3. In addition, a sharper diffraction peak at 26.4° in Fe-NC(ZIF-8) indicated that parts of the sample had a high graphitic crystallization degree, which was further verified by the Raman spectra. In Fig. 2(b), evident 2D peak at approximately 2683.9 cm−1, which is acknowledged to be related to the number of graphene layers, can be seen in Fe-NC(ZIF-8) [37,38]. The higher graphitic crystallization degree of Fe-NC(ZIF-8) was attributed to the catalysis of the formed Fe species during pyrolysis [39]. The graphitization degree of the three catalysts was analyzed by the values of I D/I G. It could be found that the I D/I G of NC, Fe-NC(Zn2+), and Fe-NC(2-MIm) was approximately equal to 1, but that of Fe-NC(ZIF-8) reached 1.30, implying that Fe-NC(ZIF-8) contained more defects than Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm). The defects were greatly related to the structure change after carbonization. As shown in Fig. S7, the specific areas of all samples decreased after carbonization when compared with their precursors (Fig. 1d). Fe-NC(2-MIm) had a specific area of only 357 m2/g, which was much lower than its precursor (1371 m2/g). However, Fe-NC(Zn2+) kept a high specific area of 1320 m2/g (1669 m2/g for its precursor) owning that it could maintain its structure free from damage during the carbonization. The BET results were greatly consistent with Raman data. In Fig. 2(c and d), TEM results showed that Fe-NC(Zn2+) maintained the dodecahedral-like morphology structure without aggregation and structural collapse, except for a slight shrink in size. The average particle size of Fe-NC(Zn2+) changed from 78 to 45 nm after pyrolysis (Fig. 1a and Fig. 2d), which could be attributed by dehydrogenation, deoxidation and the evaporation of Zn. The small size was beneficial to expose more active sites and improve the utilization rate of catalysts. Furthermore, the transportation of the O2 molecular and active substances can be improved. In Fig. S4 and Table S1, although the size of Fe-NC(2-MIm) also shrunk from 56 to 35 nm, its morphology structure exhibited a slight deformation with some aggregation, which would lead to parts of active sites not being used. In Fig. S5, an obvious signal peak of the Fe element was found in the EDS spectra, but no apparent Fe species were observed in both Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm). TEM characterization was not performed for Fe-NC(ZIF-8) due to the strong magnetism derived from the (Fe, C)/Fe phase. EDS elemental mapping was further used to analyze the element distribution. As shown in Fig. 2(e-h), the Fe and N elements were distributed uniformly in Fe-NC(Zn2+), implying that Fe and N were successfully doped into the carbon structure, forming atom-level active sites. However, in Fig. S6d, a significantly weaker Fe signal was found in the EDS mapping compared to that of Fe-NC(Zn2+). ICP measurement was used to explore the mass content of the Fe element. Table S2 showed that the Fe content of the three Fe-NC catalysts was higher than that of their corresponding precursors. The Fe content of Fe-NC(Zn2+), Fe-NC(2-MIm), and F-NC(ZIF-8) was 0.61, 0.09, and 1.41 wt% respectively. The Fe content of Fe-NC(Zn2+) was approximately six times as much as that of Fe-NC(2-MIm). Notably, although Fe-NC(ZIF-8) showed the highest Fe content, most of Fe atoms formed Fe species, such as (Fe, C), Fe, and FeO phases, which will perform less ORR activity than Fe-N x active sites, especially in acid media [40]. Integrating with the analytic results for the precursors of Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm), it could be recognized that Fe3+ existing in ZIF-8 was in the form of coordination with 2-MIm, and the strong interaction between N and Fe and the micropores’ confinement effect of ZIF-8 can prevent the aggregation of Fe atom during pyrolysis, resulting in uniform Fe dispersion with an atomic level in both Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm). XPS analysis was performed to determine the chemical status of Fe active centers. Before peak fitting, peak locations were calibrated according to the C–C peak (284.8 eV). In Fig. S8a-b, the presence of the C-N bond was found in both Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm), indicating that N was successfully doped in the carbon skeleton after pyrolysis and the presence of N was conducive to the anchors of Fe atoms. The peak fitting analysis results of N 1 s could indirectly help understand the coordination environment of Fe atoms, and the high-resolution N spectrum of the catalysts showed four major N peaks containing pyridinic N (398.5 eV), pyrrolic N (399.9 eV), graphitic N (401.3 eV), and oxide pyridinic N (404.0 eV). The content of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N is typically related to the Fe-N x active sites of catalysts. Pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen own high affinity for the Fe ions. Higher content of pyridine N and pyrrole N is beneficial to bonding more Fe atoms [41–44]. In Fig. 3 (a and b), compared with Fe-NC(2-MIm), a stronger intensity of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N peaks could be seen in the high-resolution N 1 s spectrum of Fe-NC(Zn2+). The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrums of Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Fe-NC(2-MIm) were also performed to recognize the environment of Fe in catalysts. As shown in Fig. S9, it could be found that the characteristic peaks related to Fe (2p 3/2, 2p 1/2) of Fe-NC(Zn2+) were more obvious than that of Fe-NC(2-MIm) at about 710.6, and 724.4 eV [45,46], and there was no signal about zero-valence iron. Therefore, it could be considered that Fe-NC(Zn2+) has more Fe-N x structure than Fe-NC(2-MIm). XAS measurement was used to ascertain the local geometry of Fe atoms in Fe-NC(Zn2+). A dominated peak located at 1.41 Å (Fig. 3d), assigned to the scattering of Fe-N bond, could be seen in Fe-NC(Zn2+). In contrast, a dominated peak located at 2.21 Å, assigned to the scattering of the Fe-Fe bond, could be seen in the Fe foil. Besides, compared with the Fe foil, Fe-NC(Zn2+) exhibited a dominated peak at 7119.4 eV (Fig. 3c), elucidating that the active site in Fe-NC(Zn2+) was Fe-N x . In order to further confirm the existence of Fe single atom, the corresponding aberration-corrected STEM was performed. As shown in Fig. S10, a number of well-dispersed bright dots marked with yellow circles corresponded to heavier Fe atoms. These bright dots further verified the presence of isolated Fe atoms. Following the above results, it can be concluded that the first Fe doping strategy can obtain Fe-NC catalysts with the highest number of Fe-N x structures and Fe atom utilization rate. 3.2 ORR catalytic activity LSV was used to evaluate the half-cell ORR activity of catalysts at room temperature. The ORR performance of the three catalysts was first assessed in alkaline media due to the acid-dissolved Fe species (such as Fe/FeO phase) in Fe-NC(ZIF-8). In Fig. 4 (a and b), Fe-NC(Zn2+) exhibited the best ORR activity with E 1/2 of 0.95 V in 0.1 M KOH, followed by Fe-NC(2-MIm), Fe-NC(ZIF-8), and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Meanwhile, Fe-NC(Zn2+) also showed the highest diffusion-limited current density (5.80 mA cm−2) compared with the Fe-NC(2-MIm) and Fe-NC(ZIF-8) catalysts (5.30 and 5.60 mA cm−2, respectively). Notably, Fig. 4(b) showed the E 1/2 of Fe-NC(Zn2+) were approximately 70 mV higher than that of Pt/C, and the calculated mass activity of Fe-NC(Zn2+) was about 15979 m A/gFe, which was about 320 times as large as Pt/C (49 mA / gPt) (Table S3). The TOF of different electrocatalysts are also used to evaluate their ORR performance. As shown in Table S4, Fe-NC(Zn2+) had a TOF about 0.1635 s−1, which was about 6.5 times as large as that of 20% Pt/C. Due to the lower Fe content in Fe-N x active sites, Fe-NC(2-MIm) achieved poorer ORR activity (E 1/2 = 0.93 V) than Fe-NC(Zn2+). In addition, the E 1/2 of Fe-NC(ZIF-8) was only 0.91 V, which was attributed to the majority of Fe atoms forming Fe/Fe compounds rather than atomic Fe-N x sites. The ORR results above demonstrated that the number of atomic Fe-N x sites played a crucial role in ORR activity. What’s more, the values of ECSA tested by the method of double-layer capacitance also gave the similar conclusion. As shown in Fig. S11, Fe-NC(Zn2+) had the highest value of ECSA. According to the Koutecky-Levich equation, the ORR electron transfer number of Fe-NC(Zn2+) was calculated to be approximately 4 (Fig. S12a and S13), indicating that the ORR mechanism of Fe-NC(Zn2+) was a nearly four-electron process in alkaline media. In Fig. 4(c), Fe-NC(Zn2+) had the lowest Tafel slope value of 49 mV/dec., which was 3, 16, and 36 mV/dec. lower than those of Fe-NC(2-MIm), Fe-NC(ZIF-8), and Pt/C, respectively, implying that Fe-NC(Zn2+) had the fastest ORR kinetic. In addition, Fe-NC(Zn2+) also achieved high ORR activity in acidic and neutral electrolytes (Fig. 4d-g, Fig. S9). Fig. 4(d and e) showed the CV and LSV curves of Fe-NC(Zn2+), which were obtained at pH = 1, 7, and 13. The pH of 1, 7, and 13 corresponded to 0.1 M HClO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. In Fig. 4(d), the oxygen reduction peaks (E red) could be seen in the three electrolytes. The potentials of E red appeared at 0.68 V (pH = 1), 0.47 V (pH = 7), and 0.83 V (pH = 13), respectively. As a contrast, the electrochemical tests were performed for Fe-NC(2-MIm) in pH = 1, 7 and 13 media while only pH = 7 and 13 for Fe-NC(ZIF-8), because there were acid-dissolved Fe compound in Fe-NC(ZIF-8). As shown in Fig. S15, both Fe-NC(2-MIm) and Fe-NC(ZIF-8) had lower ORR performance than Fe-NC(Zn2+), with similar trend as that obtained at all pH. Fig. 4(e and f) showed that Fe-NC(Zn2+) achieved higher ORR activity in the entire pH range compared with Pt/C. The E 1/2 of Fe-NC(Zn2+) was 0.81 V (pH = 1), 0.61 V (pH = 7), and 0.95 V (pH = 13), whereas that of Pt/C was 0.89 V (pH = 1), 0.66 V (pH = 7), and 0.88 V (pH = 13). Fe-NC(Zn2+) also achieved the near four-electron ORR mechanism in neutral and acid media (Fig. S13b and S14). More importantly, Fe-NC(Zn2+) achieved higher ORR activity and stability than Pt/C in 0.1 M NaCl. After 5,000 potential cycles at 0.6–1.0 V (vs. RHE), no shift could be found in the LSV curve of Fe-NC(Zn2+), whereas the negative shift with approximately 50 mV E 1/2 loss was found in Pt/C (Fig. 4i), implying that Fe-NC(Zn2+) achieved higher stability than Pt/C in the neutral electrolyte. In addition, Fe-NC(Zn2+) exhibited significantly better ORR performance than those Fe-NC catalysts reported in the recent five years (Tables S5, S6, and S7). The above results elucidated that Fe-NC(Zn2+) achieved a superior ORR activity in the entire pH range and especially achieved high stability in neutral media. The pyrolysis condition and the Fe doping amounts of the Fe-doped ZIF-8(Zn2+) precursor was investigated to further obtain Fe-NC catalysts with more exposed Fe-N x active sites. In Fig. S16, when annealed at 1050 °C, its product, namely, the Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst, achieved the highest ORR activity among the other Fe-NC catalysts synthesized at 950 °C and 1000 °C, either in alkaline or acid media. As shown in Fig. S17, Fe-NC(Zn2+) (0.10 mM Fe), which is corresponding to Fe-NC(Zn2+) mentioned above, had the optimal oxygen reduction activity. 3.3 Liquid and all-solid Mg-air batteries tests Given the remarkable stability of Fe-NC(Zn2+) under neutral conditions, Fe-NC(Zn2+) was used as a cathode catalyst to evaluate its application potential in Mg-air batteries. In Fig. 5 (a), a home-made liquid Mg-air battery was constructed, a Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst-loaded carbon paper was prepared as the air cathode, and a polished Mg sheet served as the anode. A 10 wt% NaCl aqueous solution was used as an electrolyte. Commercial Pt/C was also used as the cathode catalyst to assemble a liquid Mg-air battery for comparison. It could be seen apparently that the Mg-air battery with Fe-NC(Zn2+) as the cathode catalyst showed an open-circuit voltage up to 1.9 V, which was significantly higher than that of Pt/C (1.7 V). Other six non-platinum based catalysts reported in recent years were used for comparisons in terms of the open-circuit voltage (Fig. 5b). Apart from the superior ORR activity in the half-cell test, it was observed that the Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst achieved the highest open-circuit voltage among six non-platinum based catalysts, which was 0.04 V higher than that of the Fe, Ni-SAs/DNSC catalyst. Furthermore, the Mg-air battery based on Fe-NC(Zn2+) can directly drive a micro fan or three LEDs, which were operated at 1.5 V in parallel, and their real pictures can be seen in Fig. S18. Fig. 5(c) showed the polarization and power density curves of the assembled liquid Mg-air battery. Notably, the voltage decreased with an increase in current density. The maximum power density for Fe-NC(Zn2+) was as high as 18 mW cm−2, whereas that for Pt/C was 8 mW cm−2. Fig. 5(d) showed the change of galvanostatic discharge voltages of the Fe-NC(Zn2+) and Pt/C catalysts. The voltages of the Fe-NC(Zn2+) Mg-air battery were 1.65 and 1.60 V when the discharge current densities were set as 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm−2, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of Pt/C, implying that Fe-NC(Zn2+) was more stable than Pt/C. The specific capacity of the Fe-NC(Zn2+) Mg-air battery gained a specific capacity of 58 mAh g−1 at a discharge current of 0.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5f). To explore the stability of the Fe-NC(Zn2+) Mg-air battery in practical applications, a micro fan driving test was conducted after a half-hour open-circuit test (Fig. S19). As shown in Fig. 5(e), the output voltage was approximately 1 V when the battery was connected to a micro fan. After 24 h, the output voltage could still be stably maintained at 1 V. However, when the micro fan was disconnected from the battery, the open-circuit voltage changed to approximately 1.65 V, slightly lower than the initial voltage of 1.9 V. The actual test results showed that Fe-NC(Zn2+) achieved good stability of energy output and might have good practical application value. In addition, as depicted in Fig. 5(g), apart from the liquid Mg-air battery, an all-solid Mg-air micro battery was also constructed to explore other probable applications, such as flexible electronics devices. A flexible carbon cloth was used to load Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5(g), the Fe-NC(Zn2+)-equipped all-solid battery also showed a high open-circuit voltage of 1.88 V, which was similar to that of the liquid Mg-air battery. Besides, its discharge performance was nearly constant at different current densities (Fig. 5i), similar to that of the liquid Mg-air battery. Owing to its high open-circuit voltage, a LED (1.5 V) or a micro fan (1 V) was easily powered for a few hours without connecting multiple all-solid batteries in series (Fig. S15), indicating that Mg-air batteries assembled with Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalysts can be used in flexible electronic devices as power sources. 4 Conclusions In summary, this study focused on the influence of three different doping strategies of Fe3+ ions on the types of active sites formed and the ORR performance of Fe-NC catalysts. The types of Fe-N x active sites depended on the existing environment of Fe3+ in the Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor. As confirmed by XRD, TEM, STEM, XPS, and XAS results, Fe-N x active sites with high atomic dispersion and content (0.61 wt%) were formed when Fe3+ ions substituted Zn2+ ions, which was attributed to the high-efficiency substitution of Zn2+ ions with Fe3+ ions during ZIF-8 growth, the strong interaction between Fe3+ ions and N atoms of 2-MIm, and ZIF-8′s micropore confinement effect. However, the majority of Fe3+ ions would be converted into Fe/(Fe, C)/FeO phases when Fe3+ ions were introduced into the pore structure of ZIF-8 by the post-adsorption method. Besides, when Fe3+ ions were introduced into the ZIF-8 structure as Fe-MIm, fewer Fe-N x active sites were obtained because the low content of Fe-MIm could be doped in ZIF-8. The Fe-NC(Zn2+) catalyst, synthesized by substituting Zn2+ ion sites with Fe3+ ions, achieved high ORR performance in the entire pH range, especially promising ORR stability in neutral media. In addition, Fe-NC(Zn2+) showed promise in the development of flexible and wearable Mg-air batteries. In this work, the established relationship between the existing environment of Fe3+ in Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursors and the formation of Fe-N x active sites in the ultimate catalysts will provide a deep understanding and guidelines for the rational design of Fe/N/C catalysts with high ORR performance.

        "dc:description": "Fe/N/C catalysts, synthesized through the pyrolysis of Fe-doped metal–organic framework (MOF) precursors, have attracted extensive attention owing to their promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity in fuel cells and/or metal-air batteries. However, post-treatments (acid washing, second pyrolysis, and so on) are unavoidable to improve ORR catalytic activity and stability. The method for introducing Fe3+ sources (anhydrous FeCl3) into the MOF structure, in particular, is a critical step that can avoid time-consuming post-treatments and result in more exposed Fe-N x active sites. Herein, three different Fe doping strategies were systematically investigated to explore their influence on the types of active sites formed and ORR performance. Fe-NC(Zn2+), synthesized by one-step pyrolysis of Fe doped ZIF-8 (Zn2+) precursor which was obtained by adding the anhydrous FeCl3 source into the Zn(NO3)2•6H2O/methanol solution before mixing, possessed the highest Fe-N x active sites due to the high-efficiency substitution of Zn2+ ions with Fe3+ ions during ZIF-8 growth, the strong interaction between Fe3+ ions and N atoms of 2-Methylimidazole (2-MIm), and ZIF-8′s micropore confinement effect. As a result, Fe-NC(Zn2+) presented high ORR activity in the entire pH range (pH = 1, 7, and 13). At pH = 13, Fe-NC(Zn2+) exhibited a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.95 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), which was 70 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C. More importantly, Fe-NC(Zn2+) showed superior ORR stability in neutral media without performance loss after 5,000 cycles. A record-high open-circuit voltage (1.9 V) was obtained when Fe-NC(Zn2+) was used as a cathodic catalyst in assembled Mg-air batteries in neutral media. The assembled liquid and all-solid Mg-air batteries with high performance indicated that Fe-NC(Zn2+) has enormous potential for use in flexible and wearable Mg-air batteries.",
