Work has focused on developing both catalysts and processes. Unfortunately, much of the catalyst development work was done under conditions where catalyst deactivation was rapid and possibly accelerated by the test equipment chosen to compare catalysts and conditions.

A CSR system has been shown to give relatively constant activity over much greater times than conventional fixed-bed or batch reactor systems. The effects of these parameters on olefin conversion, useful catalyst lifetime and product quality are reported and initial rate constants, catalyst deactivation rates and an energy of activation for olefin conversion are calculated. In summary, these experiments show the dramatic effect of time-on- stream for the reaction of isobutane and 2-butene, which exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. The first stage is the \"initial activity\", which is never actually observed due to experimental limitations but is important in kinetic treatment of the data. The second stage is the \"useful lifetime of the catalyst\", which is characterized by high olefin conversion and relatively slow catalyst deactivation. The third stage is the \"rapid deactivation\" region where a rapid loss of catalyst activity for olefin conversion coupled with a change in selectivity from Cs-Cs products to C9+ products occurs. The fourth stage is where the product of olefin conversion is primarily C9+ products and the deactivation is again rather slow. These experiments also show that most changes in experimental conditions which increase the concentration of unreacted olefin (e.g., decreasing olefin conversion by increasing feed olefin concentration, decreasing feed olefin residence time, etc.) decreases the catalyst lifetime and product quality. The experiments also show that there is an optimum reaction temperature which balances the low olefin conversion at low temperature and the high oligomerization activity at high temperature.

Introduction Alkylation processes based on solid acid catalysts have been studied with varying degrees of urgency for the last three decades. An excellent overview of these studies has recently been given by Corma et al. [1]. Early work was driven by attempts to develop an alkylation process which would be more cost effective and easier to operate than commercial liquid acid alkylation processes [2]. As it became evident that solid acid alkylation processes could not compete on an economic basis, interest dwindled. In the late 1980's, interest was rekindled when public concerns over the safety of hydrofluoric acid (HF) alkylation plants were raised [3-5]. At that time, no commercially demonstrated alternative technology was available. This gave a renewed sense of urgency for the development of solid acid alkylation processes. However, given the safety improvements in existing HF alkylation plants brought about by the installation of aerosol mitigation equipment, the EPA recommended that no further regulations be placed on HF alkylation plants [6]. With this recommendation in place, interest in the development of solid acid alkylation processes again appears to be decreasing. Once more, the pendulum is swinging back toward competition between solid acid and liquid acid alkylation processes on a purely economic basis. The goal of developing a solid acid alkylation process which competes eco- nomically with conventional liquid acid alkylation processes is challenging. Such a process must have acceptable investment costs relative to liquid acid alkylation processes, be cheaper and easier to operate, and be environmentally friendly. Much of the technology developed to date suffers from overly rapid catalyst deactivation, unduly long hydrocarbon residence times, requirement of excessively high iso- paraffin/olefin mole ratios, and excessive amounts of side reactions with corre- spondingly low yield of alkylate. Never-the-less, after many years of development, solid acid alkylation processes are slowly moving from the laboratory to pilot plant and beyond [7]. Processes whose conception and development came about in the flurry of work conducted when the fate of HF alkylation was still unknown, are poised to move into the market place. Further development of these processes and commercialization are now being impeded by the lack of urgency felt in the refining community. Work done in developing solid acid alkylation processes has focused on both catalyst and process developments. Unfortunately, much of the catalyst develop- R.J. Taylor, D.E. Sherwood Jr.~Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 195-215 197 ment work was done under conditions where catalyst deactivation was rapid and possibly accelerated by the test equipment chosen to compare catalysts and conditions. It has been shown that under typical operating conditions, significant catalyst deactivation occurs within the first 30 min of an experiment using a fixed- bed reactor [8,9]. Under these conditions, the true performance of the catalyst for alkylation is not measured. Batch and semi-batch catalyst evaluations also suffer from accelerated deactivation unless proper measures are taken [10,11 ]. Compared with fixed-bed and batch reactors, a continuous stirred reactor (CSR) has been shown to give relatively constant activity over much greater times [12]. However, given this advantage over other testing methods, little work has been reported using CSR systems. This paper reports a study of the effect of time-on-stream, olefin concentration, feed olefin residence time, temperature, and catalyst loading for isobutane/2-butene alkylation using a CSR system. The effects of these parameters on olefin conversion, useful catalyst lifetime and product quality are reported and initial rate constants, catalyst deactivation rates and an energy of activation for olefin conversion are calculated. Performance equations were also determined which allowed the calculation of initial conversion activity, change in conversion activity over time and an estimate of the useful lifetime of the catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Equipment description Experiments were conducted in an Autoclave catalytic reactor system utilizing a Berty stationary catalyst basket. This system is an internal recycle, gradientless reactor designed with a fixed catalyst bed and a bottom entering vane-type impeller. Circulation in this type of reactor is directed upward along the vessel wall then deflected downward through the catalyst bed. The reactor had an internal diameter of 7.6 cm and a free volume of 280 cm3. The volume of the reactor containing all the internals and 30 g of catalyst was determined to be 204 cm3. Liquid feed entered and exited through the top of the reactor. An internal thermocouple was placed inside the catalyst bed through the top of the reactor to measure the catalyst bed temperature. The reactor temperature was controlled using a three zone electric furnace. The reactor pressure was controlled using a pneumatic valve controlled from the signal produced by a transducer which measured the reactor pressure. The feed entered the reactor system from two pressurized tanks, one containing 25 wt% 2-butene in isobutane and the other containing 99+ wt% isobutane. Individual flow rates from each tank were con- trolled using liquid mass flow controllers. Product separation was carried out by passing the reactor effluent into a 4.5 cm i.d. 95 cm high vessel which was packed with 2 mm glass beads. The liquid product was collected in a receiver whose temperature was controlled using cooling coils connected to a circulating bath. The 198 R.J. Taylor, D.E. Sherwood J~/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997)195-215 pressure in the recovery section was controlled using a spring-controlled back- pressure valve. Gas exited the recovery section through a gas sampling loop connected to a gas chromatograph and then out to a vent system through a dry gas test meter, where the gas volume and temperature were measured. The gas and liquid compositions were determined using a HP 5890E gas chromatograph utilizing a 50 ft.2 mm i.d. HP PONA column. The liquid hold-up in the reactor at the different reactor temperatures was determined and a relationship between reactor hold-up and reactor temperature was developed. At temperatures between 100 and 200, a linear relationship was established and the liquid hold-up at different temperatures could be calcu- lated. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature for isobutane (273), this relationship does not hold. 2.2. Test procedure The catalyst (30 g) was dried in situ at 250 for 14 h in flowing nitrogen (0.5 l/h) prior to evaluation. The reactor was then cooled to the desired start of run temperature. At the start of the run, the proper flow rates were set using the mass flow controllers to give the desired olefin concentration and residence time. Prior to starting the feed to the reactor, the mixture was allowed to bypass the reactor and the olefin concentration was determined by gas chromatography and the flow rate at the gas meter was checked versus the weight loss observed in the feed tanks. Once the proper olefin concentration and flow rates were established, the feed was allowed to flow into the reactor and the pressure was increased to 300 psig. The impeller was operated at 1250rpm. Liquid leaving the reactor section was depressurized to 15 psig, allowing the unreacted feed to vaporize and be separated from the liquid product. The liquid product was collected at a constant 75 and periodically removed and weighed. After weathering for 1 h to allow the dissolved isobutane to degas, the sample was weighed again and then analyzed using gas chromatography. The values obtained on the degassed liquid samples were used to calculate the product compositions given in the tables in this report. The gas composition was determined via sample loop injection into the gas chromatograph each time a liquid sample was collected. Quantitative analysis of the gas gave the amount of unreacted 2-butene and allowed an exact calculation of the olefin conversion. Qualitative analysis of the gas showed that only a small portion of the C5-C8 product was carried out of the receiver in the gas stream and that the composition of the Cs-Cs fraction in the gas stream was very similar to that of the Cs-Cs fraction in the liquid product. We did not attempt to combine the qualitative data of the Cs-Cs fraction in the gas stream with the quantitative data of the Cs-Cs liquid product. Since the amount of Cs-Cs in the gas stream was not constant due to the different conditions of each experiment, the C5+ liquid yield values were not considered reliable enough to use in the kinetic analysis of the data and will not be reported. The product composi- R.J. Taylor, D.E. Sherwood Jr./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 195-215 199 tions reported in the tables (which are those measured on the degassed liquid samples) were considered to be reliable because the qualitative composition of the C5-C8 in the gas stream was very similar to the quantitative composition of the C5-C8 in the liquid product. The catalyst used in this investigation was an ultrastable zeolite Y (CBV-500) obtained from PQ Corporation. The catalyst was in the form of a nominal 1.6 mm diameter extrudate composed of 80% zeolite and 20% alumina binder. The zeolite used to prepare the extrudate was reported by the manufacturer to have a SiO2/ A1203 molar ratio of 6.16, a lattice constant of 24.52 and a crystallinity of 92%. The 80/20 extrudates had a single point BET surface area of 665 mZ/g. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of time-on-stream The reaction of isobutane and 2-butene in a CSR exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. In order to illustrate these stages, we will first consider a single experiment performed with the process parameters given in Table 1. To illustrate the stages of activity, we first consider the changes in olefin conversion with time on stream as given in Fig. 1. The first stage of activity, as typified by olefin conversion, is the \"initial activity\" at time zero. This is presumed to be the Table 1 Effect of time-on-stream on product composition during isobutane/2-butene alkylation Time-on-stream (h) 3 23 37 X2B 0.98 0.90 0.26 Composition of Cs+ (wt%) C5~27 15 18 0 C8 78 65 20 C9+ 7 17 80 TMP 72 58 3 Composition of C8 (wt%) TMP 92 88 15 DMH 8 11 32 Composition of TMP (wt%) 2,2,4-TMP 28 21 2,2,3-TMP 10 7 2,3,4-TMP 26 33 2,3,3-TMP 36 39 m m m Experimental conditions for run no. 2210 Berty CSR: 149, 1.92 wt% 2-butene, 30 g catalyst, 210 ml/h. 200 R.Z Toylot: D.E.

The second stage of activity is a region where olefin conversion is maintained at very high levels. During this second stage of activity, the olefin conversion decreases only slowly over time such that the olefin conversion activity is generally maintained at greater than 90%. It is this second stage of activity which defines the \"useful lifetime of the catalyst.\" As the age of the catalyst continues to increase, a third stage of activity is reached which is characterized as a period of \"rapid deactivation\" of olefin conversion (generally decreasing to below 30%). Finally, a fourth stage of activity is reached which is characterized by a low but never-the-less measurable level of olefin conversion activity and a second period of rather slow deactivation. To illustrate the stages of selectivity, we next consider the changes in product compositions with time on stream as given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Product compositions during the first stage of \"initial activity\" at time zero are never observed, as discussed above. Early in the second stage of activity, which we have defined as the useful lifetime of the catalyst, the composition of the C5+ product is primarily Cs compounds which in turn are primarily trimethylpentanes (TMP). Thus, early in the useful lifetime of the catalyst (as typified by the data obtained after 3 h in Table 1), the primary product of olefin conversion is Cs isoparaffins (i.e., classical alkylation reaction products). As the catalyst activity for olefin conversion slowly deactivates during the useful lifetime of the catalyst, the selectivity to Cs compounds gradually decreases (with a corresponding rise in C5-C7 and C9+ compounds) and the selectivity of the Cs compounds to TMP also gradually decreases (with a corresponding rise in dimethylhexanes (DMH)). Even so, toward the end of the useful lifetime of the catalyst (as typified by the data obtained after 23 h in Table 1), the primary product of olefin conversion is still Cs isoparaffins. At the onset of the period of \"rapid deactivation\" of olefin conver- sion, there is also a rapid change in terms of selectivity both to Cs compounds and to TMP in the C8 fraction. Once the fourth stage of activity is reached (as typified by the data obtained after 37 h in Table 1), which is characterized by a low but measurable level of olefin conversion activity and a second period of rather slow deactivation, the composition of the C5+ product shifts from predominately Cs to R.J.

We also found it useful to consider the cracking activity of the catalyst. Fig. 2 shows that there were small but significant amounts of both C5-C7 and C9+ components in the C5+ product during the useful lifetime of the catalyst (indeed, for most of this stage, the amount of C5-C7 compounds was found to be greater than the amount of C9compounds). This suggests that in addition to the alkylation reaction, there was also some formation of Cl2components which then cracked to lighter Cs-C1] components (including the C5-C7 fraction) during the useful lifetime of the catalyst. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, the cracking activity essentially went to zero after the period of rapid deactivation as evidenced by the disappearance of the C5-C7 fraction. To summarize, the reaction of isobutane and 2-butene in a CSR exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. The first stage is the \"initial activity\", which is never actually observed due to experimental limitations but is important in kinetic treatment of the data, as will be discussed below. The second stage is the \"useful lifetime of the catalyst\", which is characterized by high olefin conversion and relatively slow catalyst deactivation. The C5product composition in this region is predominantly Cs isoparaffins. There is also a significant C5-C7 content in the product from this stage, suggesting the products from olefin oligomerization 202 R.J. Taylor, D.E.

The third stage of activity is the \"rapid deactiva- tion\" region. This transition stage is characterized by a rapid loss of catalyst activity for olefinconversion coupled with a change in selectivity from C5-C8 products to C9+ products. This suggests that deactivation results from a loss of alkylation and cracking activity while maintaining some level of oligomerization activity. This transition regions leads into the fourth stage of activity, where the product of olefin conversion is characterized as being primarily C9+ products and the deactivation is again rather slow. 3.2. Effect of olefin concentration The effect of the olefin concentration on the alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene was investigated. Fig. 3 shows that increasing the olefin concentration in the feed dramatically decreased the useful lifetime of the catalyst. At 2% olefin concentration in the feed, the useful lifetime of the catalyst was about 20 h; at 3% olefin concentration in the feed, the useful lifetime of the catalyst was severely reduced to only about 6 h. Increasing the concentration to even higher values (e.g., 6%) resulted in almost immediate catalyst deactivation with no useful lifetime of the catalyst. Table 2 gives product compositions taken and measured at the earliest opportunities during the evaluations. Table 2 shows that this early 2-butene conversion activity decreased with increasing feed olefin concentration. This in turn suggests that as the concentration of olefin in the feed increased, the availability of excess olefin to participate in other reactions increased, including the reactions which are responsible for catalyst deactivation. These reactions were found to be primarily olefin oligomerization followed by cracking. Note that both the C9components and the C5-C7 components of the C5+ product increased with increasing feed olefin content at the expense of C8 components. This increase in oligomerization activity with increasing feed olefin content is felt to be responsible for the more rapid catalyst deactivation and shortening of the catalyst life. It can be R.J.

Effect of residence time The effect of feed olefin residence time on the catalyst performance at both 200 and 150 was investigated. Fig. 4 shows that decreasing the olefin residence time decreased the useful lifetime of the catalyst. First we considered the data obtained at about 200 At a residence time of 1.64 h, the useful lifetime of the catalyst was about 45 h; at a residence time of 0.93 h, the useful lifetime of the catalyst was reduced to only about 19 h. Decreasing the olefin residence time to even lower values (e.g., 0.42 h) resulted in a severe reduction in the useful life of the catalyst. These results appeared to confirm that any factor which decreased olefin conversion and increased the concentration of excess olefin, such as decreased feed olefin residence time, was detrimental to catalyst lifetime. Table 2 shows that an increase in the flow rate (i.e. a decrease in olefin residence time) 204 R.J. Taylor, D.E.

This is consistent with a change in the selectivity of the oligomer- ization/cracking reactions at lower residence times to give higher amounts of C8 and less C5-C7. Table 2 also shows that the composition of the C8 fraction remained fairly constant with increasing flow rates (i.e., the main product being TMP in all cases). Similar trends were seen in the data obtained at 150. 3.4. Effect of temperature The effect of reaction temperature on catalyst performance was studied. Fig. 5 shows that there was an optimum temperature between 100 and 200 which gives the maximum useful catalyst lifetime. Table 2 shows that the C8 fraction is also maximized between 100 and 200 but the TMP content of the C8 fraction decreased steadily as the temperature increased. These results suggest that as the temperature increases, the rate of oligomerization and secondary cracking reac- 100 .-e. 8O 60 0 40 o 20 i i 1 2 3 4 Catalyst Age, g Olefin/g catalyst Fig. 5.

The occurrence of an optimum temperature is therefore a trade off between decreased conversion at the lower temperature (and thus high excess olefin concentration) and increased oligomerization at the higher temperature, both of which decrease catalyst lifetime. The effect of increased cracking reactions on catalyst lifetime and product composition may also be important. 3.5. Effect of catalyst loading The effect of catalyst loading on the catalyst performance was investigated. Fig. 6 shows that lowering the amount of catalyst from 30 to 20 g had very little effect on catalyst lifetime or product composition. However, when 10 g of catalyst were used, the catalyst lifetime was decreased dramatically. This suggested that as long as enough catalyst was present to maintain a high olefin conversion, the catalyst lifetime and product quality were not affected. However, once the amount of catalyst was low enough to allow the concentration of unreacted olefin to increase, the rate of oligomerization reactions increased and catalyst performance decreased. 4. Discussion 4.1. Catalytic cycle The widely accepted catalytic cycle for alkylation is shown in Fig. 7 [13]. In this cycle, the catalyst must be able to promote the initial formation of a t-butyl carbenium ion in a two-step process (involving protonation of a 2-butene molecule to form an n-butyl carbenium ion followed by a hydride transfer from an isobutane molecule forming n-butane and the desired t-butyl carbenium ion), catalyze the 206 R.J. Taylor, D.E. Sherwood J~:/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 195-215 Acid H + other C40lefins Fig. 7. Catalytic cycle for alkylation. reaction of the carbenium ion with another 2-butene molecule to form a C+ carbenium ion and promote the hydrogen transfer from another isobutane to the C~- carbenium ion forming the desired Cs product and regenerating the t-butyl carbenium ion. What are not shown in Fig. 7 are the side reactions which can take place if the catalyst or process conditions are inadequate. If the catalyst has the ability to catalyze the formation of the n-butylcation from the olefin but not the hydride transfer reactions, the n-butyl cation and excess olefin can further react to give oligomerization products. If the hydride transfer reaction between C~- and isobutane is too slow, further reaction of C+ and an olefin can occur, also resulting in undesirable oligomer products. Once these C9+ products are formed through oligomerization reactions, they can crack to form lighter products or condense on the catalyst and cause deactivation. The lighter cracked products can include both C5-C7 and C8 (including DMH and TMP). This complex matrix of reaction products complicate interpretation of compositional data obtained at different experimental conditions. It can also be seen that an increase in the olefin concentration at the catalyst surface will increase oligomerization (i.e., if there is too much 2-butene in the presence of the initially formed n-butyl carbenium ion). This effect is greater for oligomerization reactions relative to alkylation reactions because oligomerization is second-order in olefin where alkylation is only first- R.J. Taylor, D.E. Sherwood Jr.~Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997)195-215 207 order in olefin. Similar results have been reported by others using a fixed-bed reactor system [1]. 4.2. Kinetics of the solid acid alkylation reaction 4.2.1. Theoretical expressions for kinetic parameters Isobutane alkylation is the reaction of isobutane (IB) with an olefin, in this case 2-butene (2B), to form a C8 hydrocarbon. This reaction is described in the simplest form in IB + 2B ---+ Products (1) Under the conditions used to carry out this reaction, the concentration of IB is much greater than that of 2B and can be considered constant. This allows Eq. (2) to be used as the rate expression for the disappearance of 2B where k is the reaction rate constant and Cp is the concentration of 2B in the CSR product. --rZB = kCp. (2) While this is a very simplistic view of a complex reaction network which involves other primary and secondary reactions of 2-butene, it proves useful for determining kinetic expressions during the initial stages of catalyst life under the conditions of the experiments studied here. As described above, the primary products formed during the early lifetime of the catalyst were C8 compounds, mainly TME Since the catalyst deactivates over time, a deactivation function, a(t), must be added to Eq. (2) to account for the decrease in catalyst activity over time. --rzB(t) = a(t)kCp. (3) Assuming a first-order deactivation with respect to time, the deactivation function can be expressed as shown in Eq. (4) where t is the time on stream for the catalyst and kd is the first-order deactivation rate constant. a(t) = exp(--kdt). (4) For a CSR reactor which uses a batch of solid catalyst and a mixed constant flow of fluid, the rate can be expressed using Eq. (5), where FZB is the flow rate of 2B, X2u is the fractional conversion of 2B, and Wcat is the weight of catalyst in the reactor. Eq. (6) defines the weight-time factor r' where Cf is the concentration of 2-butene in the feed and Eq. (7) expresses Cp in terms of Cf and XzB. --rZB = F2BX2B/Wcat, (5) \"r' = CfWc,t/F2s, (6) Cp = cf(1 - x2B). (7) Using Eqs. (3)-(7), Eq. (8) can be developed and subsequently, Eq. (9). XZB/(1 -- XzB) = kw7' exp(--kdt), (8) 208 R.J. Taylor, D.E. Shenvood Jr./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 195-215 ln[X2B/(1 - X2B)] ---- ln[kw~-'] - kdt. (9) Therefore if the assumptions above are correct, a plot of ln[X2~/(1--XzB)] versus t for each experiment will give a straight line where the first-order deactivation rate constant, kd, can be calculated from the slope and the first-order reaction rate constant, k, from the intercept. In this case, k is expressed as kw to designate it accounts for the weight of catalyst. Assuming the reaction rate constant can be represented by Arrhenius law, it can also be expressed as Eq. (10) where ko is the frequency factor, E is the activation energy for the reaction, T is the reaction temperature and R is the gas constant. kw = k0 exp[(-E/R)/7~)]. (10) Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (8) and rearranging gives Eq. (11) and, subse- quently, Eq. (12) can be developed. XZB/(1 - XZB)/T' = ko exp[(-E/R)/V)] exp(--kdt), (11) ln[X2B/(1 -- XZB)/T'] = ln[k0 exp(--kdt)] -- (E/R)/T. (12) From Eq. (12), a plot of ln[XzB0/(1 --XZB0)/T'], where X2B0 is the fractional conversion of 2B at t=0, versus 1/Tyields the energy of activation from the slope (-E/R) and the frequency factor from the intercept [ln(ko)]. kw can then be calculated from Eq. (10). 4.2.2. Kinetic parameters from experimental data The data from these experiments were used to calculate kinetic parameters using the theoretical method described above. In this analysis, the 2-butene conversion versus time data was filled into Eq. (9) and graphed, giving a deactivation rate constant, kd, and a reaction rate constant, kw, for each experiment. Fig. 8 shows a plot of the data from one experiment which is representative of the others. It is apparent from the linear plot of ln[XzB/(1--X2B)] versus t that the initial reaction rate and deactivation rate are well represented by the theory presented above. 3 x, 2 - o (1) (2) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time, hr Fig. 8.

In two of the experiments, this catastrophic deactiva- tion occurred too early for the kd of the initial deactivation and kw of the initial reaction to be calculated (Run Nos. 2201 and 2216 with the highest concentration of feed olefin and the lowest loading of catalyst, respectively). The values calculated using this analysis method, along with the experimental conditions for each of the experiments, are shown in Table 3. Theoretically, the kw values for experiments at the same temperature should be the same, and in general, this holds true. The exceptions, as noted above, are when high initial olefin concentrations or very low catalyst loadings are used. In these cases, the useful catalyst lifetime is too brief and kd could not be accurately measured. For this reason, the parameters derived here are only useful for low initial olefin concentrations (<3 wt%) and high catalyst loadings (>100 g cat/l). Fig. 9 shows a plot of Eq. (12) for the experimental data. The energy of activation, E (4.25 kcal/mol), and frequency factor, ko (344 1/g cat/h), for the initial olefin conversion were calculated from the slope and intercept, respectively. Again, these values are only useful within the range of experimental conditions described above. 210 R.J. Taylor, D.E.

Arrhenius plot for alkylation reaction It is easy to see that kd must be a strong function of initial feed olefin concentration. At high values of feed olefin concentration deactivation was very fast. To illustrate this point, consider the trend in useful catalyst lifetimes. At a feed olefin concentration of 1.97 wt%, the useful catalyst lifetime was 1.85 g of olefin processed per gram of catalyst (Run no. 2211). Increasing the feed olefin content to 3.19 wt% decreased the useful catalyst lifetime to only 0.98 g of olefin processed per gram of catalyst (Run no. 2203). A further increase in feed olefin content to 6.27 wt% caused such instantaneous deactivation that we can only comment that the useful catalyst lifetime must be <0.6 g of olefin processed per gram of catalyst (Run no. 2201). For runs with feed olefin contents greater than ~2 wt%, we did not feel that we could calculate an accurate value for kd because the deactivation was too rapid. An empirical relationship for kd was developed in terms of the free (or unreacted) olefin content at t=0 (for feed olefin contents of <3 wt%), temperature (for values in the range of 100-200) and weight-time factor. This empirical relationship is given in Eq. (13) and fits the experimental data fairly well given the limited number of experiments. kd = (CfX2Bo)/(a - bZ2) -~- 1/(c3j2 - d) - e, (13) where a=0.0465, b=8.25E-7, c=0.0156, d=41.8, and e=0.005. Free olefin content at t=0, Cp0, is expressed in Eq. (13) as (CfX2~o) because with known values of ko, (E/R), Tand 7-/, this quantity is easily calculable via Eq. (11). Again, we would expect this relationship to only be valid with feed olefin contents of <3 wt%, and the data were developed with feed olefin contents of ~2 wt%. Fig. 10 shows a plot of kd values calculated by Eq. (13) versus kd values calculated from a fit of each individual experiment. There is very nearly a one-to-one correspondence. Thus, the first-order deactivation rate constant can be predicted from the kinetic parameters calculated for t=0. The relationship between useful catalyst lifetime and experimental conditions (i.e., from the kinetic parameters calculated for t--0) were found to be more R.J. Taylor, D.E.

Predicted versus calculated values for kd. 211 difficult to express. When only the flow rate is varied, it can be seen from Fig. 11 that catalyst lifetime, expressed as maximum catalyst age, decreases as flow rate increases. When only temperature is varied, an optimum temperature occurs where the lifetime is a maximum. Fig. 11 also shows that catalyst lifetime drops dramatically as initial olefin concentration increases. One method to predict useful catalyst lifetime would be to use Eq. (13) to calculate kd and then to use Eqs. (3) and (4) to predict a value for t when olefin conversion has reached a limiting value (generally in our experiments the onset of the period of rapid deactivation occurred when olefin conversion reached about 92%). A second method to predict useful catalyst lifetimes would be to use Eq. (13) to calculate kd and then to use Eq. (14) to calculate the half-life of the 2-butene conversion activity, tl/2. tl/2 = ln(2)/kd. (14) As shown in Table 3, the number of half-lives per useful catalyst lifetime, for all of the runs (lifetime~q/z), was fairly constant (3.6.4). If we neglect Run 2208, which gave an unusually large number (lifetime/tl/2=4.4), the average number of half-lives per useful catalyst lifetime is reduced to 3.5.2. Thus, the useful catalyst lifetime can be estimated by lifetime --~ 3.5tl/2 (15) or lifetime _~ 2.4/kd. (16) 4.2.3.

Once XZB0 has been determined, kd can be calculated for a set of T, FZB, and Cf. After kd has been calculated, XZB for any time, t, can be calculated. Fig. 12 shows a plot of how well the experimental data can be fit using the performance equations derived in this work. As shown in Fig. 12, a breakdown of this relationship occurs when catastrophic deactivation begins (i.e., at the end of the useful catalyst lifetime). The useful catalyst lifetime can be estimated as discussed above, particularly by the use of Eq. (16). 5. Conclusions In summary, these experiments show the dramatic effect of time-on-stream for the reaction of isobutane and 2-butene, which exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. The first stage is the \"initial activity\", which is never actually observed due to experimental limitations but is important in kinetic treatment of the data. The second stage is the \"useful lifetime of the catalyst\", which is characterized by high olefin conversion and relatively slow catalyst deactivation. The C5+ product composition in this region is predominantly C8 isoparaffins. There is also a significant C5-C7 content in the product from this stage, suggesting the products from olefin oligomerization are cracked to lighter products. The third stage of activity is the \"rapid deactivation\" region. This transition stage is characterized by a rapid loss of catalyst activity for olefin conversion coupled with a change in selectivity from C5-Cs products to C9+ products. This suggests that deactivation results in a loss of both alkylation and cracking activity while maintaining some level of oligomerization activity. This transition region leads into the fourth stage of activity, where the product of olefin 214 R.,L Taylor, D.E. Sherwood Jr.~Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 195 215 conversion is characterized as being primarily C9+ products and the deactivation is again rather slow. These experiments show that most changes which increase the concentration of unreacted olefin (e.g., decreasing olefin conversion by increasing feed olefin concentration, decreasing feed olefin residence time, etc.) decreases the catalyst lifetime and product quality. The experiments also show that there is an optimum reaction temperature which balances the low olefin conversion at low temperature and the high oligomerization activity at high temperature. The optimum conditions for extending catalyst lifetime, in the range of parameters studied, were found to be moderate temperature and low feed flow rates for feed 2-butene concentrations around 2 wt%. A set of performance equations from kinetic parameters was developed to describe the conversion of 2-butene under various experimental conditions using a USY catalyst. These performance equations allowed the calculation of initial conversion activity, change in conversion activity over time and an estimate of the useful catalyst lifetime of the catalyst. 6.

Sherwood Jr. Texaco Inc., Fuels and Lubricants Technology Department, PO Box 1608, 4545 Savannah Ave., Port Arthur, TX 77641, USA ∗ Corresponding author. Alkylation processes based on solid acid catalysts have been studied with varying degrees of urgency for the last three decades. Work has focused on developing both catalysts and processes. Unfortunately, much of the catalyst development work was done under conditions where catalyst deactivation was rapid and possibly accelerated by the test equipment chosen to compare catalysts and conditions. Under these circumstances, the true performance of the catalyst for alkylation was not measured. This paper reports a study of the effect of time-on-stream, olefin concentration, feed olefin residence time, temperature, and catalyst loading for isobutane/2-butene alkylation using a continuous stirred reactor (CSR) system. A CSR system has been shown to give relatively constant activity over much greater times than conventional fixed-bed or batch reactor systems. The effects of these parameters on olefin conversion, useful catalyst lifetime and product quality are reported and initial rate constants, catalyst deactivation rates and an energy of activation for olefin conversion are calculated. In summary, these experiments show the dramatic effect of time-onstream for the reaction of isobutane and 2-butene, which exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. The first stage is the “initial activity”, which is never actually observed due to experimental limitations but is important in kinetic treatment of the data. The second stage is the “useful lifetime of the catalyst”, which is characterized by high olefin conversion and relatively slow catalyst deactivation. The third stage is the “rapid deactivation” region where a rapid loss of catalyst activity for olefin conversion coupled with a change in selectivity from C5–C8 products to C9+ products occurs. The fourth stage is where the product of olefin conversion is primarily C9+ products and the deactivation is again rather slow. These experiments also show that most changes in experimental conditions which increase the concentration of unreacted olefin (e.g., decreasing olefin conversion by increasing feed olefin concentration, decreasing feed olefin residence time, etc.) decreases the catalyst lifetime and product quality. The experiments also show that there is an optimum reaction temperature which balances the low olefin conversion at low temperature and the high oligomerization activity at high temperature. A set of performance equations from kinetic parameters were derived to describe the conversion of 2-butene under various experimental conditions using a USY catalyst. These performance equations allowed the calculation of initial conversion activity, change in conversion activity over time and an estimate of the useful lifetime of the catalyst.

        "dc:description": "Alkylation processes based on solid acid catalysts have been studied with varying degrees of urgency for the last three decades. Work has focused on developing both catalysts and processes. Unfortunately, much of the catalyst development work was done under conditions where catalyst deactivation was rapid and possibly accelerated by the test equipment chosen to compare catalysts and conditions. Under these circumstances, the true performance of the catalyst for alkylation was not measured. This paper reports a study of the effect of time-on-stream, olefin concentration, feed olefin residence time, temperature, and catalyst loading for isobutane/2-butene alkylation using a continuous stirred reactor (CSR) system. A CSR system has been shown to give relatively constant activity over much greater times than conventional fixed-bed or batch reactor systems. The effects of these parameters on olefin conversion, useful catalyst lifetime and product quality are reported and initial rate constants, catalyst deactivation rates and an energy of activation for olefin conversion are calculated. In summary, these experiments show the dramatic effect of time-onstream for the reaction of isobutane and 2-butene, which exhibits four distinct stages of activity and selectivity. The first stage is the “initial activity”, which is never actually observed due to experimental limitations but is important in kinetic treatment of the data. The second stage is the “useful lifetime of the catalyst”, which is characterized by high olefin conversion and relatively slow catalyst deactivation. The third stage is the “rapid deactivation” region where a rapid loss of catalyst activity for olefin conversion coupled with a change in selectivity from C5–C8 products to C9+ products occurs. The fourth stage is where the product of olefin conversion is primarily C9+ products and the deactivation is again rather slow. These experiments also show that most changes in experimental conditions which increase the concentration of unreacted olefin (e.g., decreasing olefin conversion by increasing feed olefin concentration, decreasing feed olefin residence time, etc.) decreases the catalyst lifetime and product quality. The experiments also show that there is an optimum reaction temperature which balances the low olefin conversion at low temperature and the high oligomerization activity at high temperature. A set of performance equations from kinetic parameters were derived to describe the conversion of 2-butene under various experimental conditions using a USY catalyst. These performance equations allowed the calculation of initial conversion activity, change in conversion activity over time and an estimate of the useful lifetime of the catalyst.",
