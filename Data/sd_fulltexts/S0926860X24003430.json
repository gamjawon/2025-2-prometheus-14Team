Fig. 1 (A) Schematic representation of the catalytic setup used for CO2 trapping and methanation. N2, O2 and CO2 were fed through mass flow controllers (MFC). The feed could be sent through a 4-way valve (4-W) to the sorbent and catalytic bed located in a MW oven first or directly into the FT-IR gas analyzer. (B) Illustration of power delivery in MW technology for a nominal 50 % of the full power capacity: left, the “non-inverter” technology, the MW irradiation switches between maximum power and none; right, the “inverter” technology, power is supposedly constant and changeable step-wise. (C) Examples of FT-IR transmission spectra showing the typical signals of CH4, CO and CO2 measured with the IR gas-cell. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 (A) Product selectivity and CO2 conversion calculated over the 300 s duration of the experiment under MW irradiation during continuous flow of 2 % CO2 + 20 % H2 in N2, total flow: 50 mL min–1, MW power = 300 W. Sample masses were 450 mg of SiC and 300 mg of SiC + 99 mg of Fe3O4, respectively. (B) Evolution of CO2, CH4 and CO concentrations as a function of time under MW irradiation in the case of the reactor filled with SiC + Fe3O4. (C) Catalytic activity of 104 mg of Fe3O4 measured in a quartz flow reactor located in a conventional tubular furnace. Same flow as in (A). Fig. 2 Fig. 3 (A) Reactor layout consisting of a layer of a mechanical mixture SiC (300 mg) + Fe3O4 (100 mg) followed by a Co/Siralox (48 mg) layer and (B) pictures of the reactor under a MW power of 270 W at different times. A link gathering videos recorded at 440, 300, 270 and 100 W is given in [33]. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Evolution of the illuminance (in lux, lx) as a function of time under MW irradiation for different MW oven nominal powers: (A) 440 W, (B) 300 W, (C) 270 W and (D) 100 W. Reactor filled with SiC (300 mg) + Fe3O4 (100 mg) followed by Co/Siralox (48 mg) as described in Fig. 3A. Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Evolution of CO2, CH4 and CO concentrations as a function of time under MW irradiation during continuous flow of 2 % CO2 + 20 % H2 in N2, total flow: 50 mL min–1, for different MW oven power: (A) 440 W, (B) 300 W, (C) 270 W and (D) 100 W. See a zoom of [CH4] measured under 100 W in the corresponding inset (D). Reactor filled with SiC (300 mg) + Fe3O4 (100 mg) followed by Co/Siralox (48 mg) as described in Fig. 3A. Fig. 5 Fig 6 (A) CO2 conversion and selectivity to CO and CH4 calculated over 300 s at different MW oven power. Irradiation were done under a continuous flow of 2 % CO2 + 20 % H2 in N2, total flow: 50 mL min–1. Reactor filled with SiC (300 mg) + Fe3O4 (100 mg) followed by Co/Siralox (48 mg) as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Catalytic activity of 50 mg of Co/Siralox measured in a quartz flow reactor located in a conventional tubular furnace. Same flow as in (A). Fig 6 Fig. 7 Products released as a function of time under MW for three consecutive runs. The sample was first exposed to 2 % CO2 + 20 % O2 in N2 for 5 min, then purged under N2 for 5 min, then left for 5 min under 20 % H2 in N2 with a total flow of 50 mL min–1. The MW were then turned on for 5 min still under 20 % H2 in N2 with a total flow of 50 mL min–1. MW power = 100 W. Reactor filled with SiC (300 mg) + Fe3O4 (101 mg) followed by Co/Siralox (100 mg). Fig. 7 Fig. 8 CO2 conversion and selectivity to CO and CH4 calculated over 300 s over three consecutive runs. MW power = 100 W.

SiC and Fe3O4 were used as microwave (MW) susceptors in a novel type of domestic MW oven featuring the so-called “Inverter” technology used for CO2 trapping and methanation. A catalyst based on cobalt was added and the conversion of CO2 was studied both in continuous mode (co-feeding H2 and CO2) and pulsed mode (sequential CO2 trapping and desorption/hydrogenation). CO2 conversion up to 80 % could be achieved over the physical mixture of SiC, Fe3O4 and Co/Al2O3, although high selectivities to CO were observed. The periodic glow of the susceptors and the corresponding oscillation of the catalytic activity at powers lower than 440 W revealed that MW power delivery was actually pulsed, unlike the manufacturer claim. Higher output power enabled both higher CO2 conversion rate and selectivity to CH4. The catalytic performances were improved by operating in CO2 trapping/methanation mode as compared to a continuous flow mode.

CO2 could be used as a feedstock to produce base chemicals, such as syngas and carbonates. CCU technologies are still under development and their commercial viability will depend on the reduction of production costs, in particular those related to energy consumption, several energy models being considered [1]. CCU coupled with Power-to-Gas (PtG) technology is investigated here through the trapping and subsequent desorption and hydrogenation of CO2 into CH4. CH4 is produced through Sabatier reaction (Eq. (1)): (1) CO2 + 4 H2 → CH4 + 2 H2O (2) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O The Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction (Eq. (2)) is often proposed as an intermediate step during methanation [2]. The H2 needed for these reactions should preferably be obtained from water electrolysis using renewable or nuclear energy. CH4 could be then directly injected into already existent pipeline networks or storage infrastructures. Developing an effective system that could combine CO2 capture and conversion to CH4 in a single unit is of particular interest for the efficiency of PtG plants [3]. One of the most mature technologies in carbon capture process is based on the use of amines solutions [4]. CO2, coming from post-combustion industrial effluents, is chemically absorbed on mixed solvents (typically aqueous solution of alkanolamines) before transportation to a site of storage. Such process has many advantages such as fast absorption rate, high selectivity to CO2 or large treatment capacity. Unfortunately, the high energy consumption needed during the regeneration step, since it requires heating of the whole system, is still a major issue. Alternatives of solvents amines are still explored such as use of “Dual Function Materials (DFM) [5−8]. DFM contains a CO2-storing component, typically an alkali or earth-alkali oxide, which exhibit a strong basic character [9−11], and a catalytic metal able to hydrogenate CO2 to methane, usually Ru or Ni or alloys of those [5−8]. Energy savings can be achieved by using microwave (MW) heating, which involves conversion of electromagnetic energy to thermal energy [12]. MW energy is directly transferred to the material through molecular or charge interaction with the electromagnetic field. For example, Jang et al. showed that desorption of a solid guanidine carbonate under MW heating is up to 17 times faster than conventional conductive heating at 160 °C, resulting in a 40 % electrical energy reduction [13]. A crucial aspect is that MW-matter interactions markedly depend on the type of material. Materials are usually classified into three categories: (1) electrical conductors (opaque) when MW are reflected at the surface; (2) low dielectric loss materials (or transparent) when MW are transmitted through materials with poor interaction and (3) high dielectric loss materials (absorbers or susceptors) when MW irradiation induces heating. Tubes, fitting and reactors can thus be made of microwave-transparent materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE (= Teflon®) or quartz [14,15], meaning that those would not consume electromagnetic energy and remain at low temperatures. Energy savings for desorption can rise up to 94 % when the sorbent is microwave-transparent (i.e. when only the adsorbed molecules are heated up) [16]. We recently reported on the use of a domestic MW oven to trap/release and methanate CO2 over a set of sorbents (ZrO2, Fe3O4) and MW absorbers (SiC, Fe3O4), using Ru/SiO2 as CO2 methanation catalyst [17]. Silica-supported ruthenium was chosen as methanation catalyst because of its high activity [6−8] and the ease with which it can be reduced. Ru is yet a rare metal and unlikely to be used in practical applications so alternative catalysts need to be explored. Cobalt-based materials are routinely used as methanation catalysts, being less toxic and volatile than Ni-based formulations [18]. The aim of the present study was to study the trapping and methanation of CO2 over a combination of SiC + Fe3O4 and supported cobalt under MW and determine whether practical conversions could be obtained. The activity under continuous flow conditions was also measured for the sake of completeness. 2 Experimental Plain Fe3O4 (10 m2 g–1) was bought from Alfa Aesar (lot X08G023). SiC (46 grit, ca. 340 μm particles) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (batch #10179265). A cobalt-based material previously investigated for CO hydrogenation [19] was used as CO2 hydrogenation catalyst: the 15 wt% Co/Siralox® (Siralox being a mixed oxide comprising about 5 % silica and 95 % alumina) was supplied by IFPEN. The surface area of the sample was 129 m2 g−1 and the average Co3O4 particle size of the calcined sample was 12 nm, based on XRD line broadening. High purity gases N2, H2, O2 and CO2 from Air Liquide were used without any further purification. The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The gas flow rates were controlled using Brooks electronic mass flow controllers. A commercial MW domestic oven (Panasonic, model NN-SD28HSGTG) featuring the “Inverter” technology was used to heat up the materials. Inverter technology allows, according to the manufacturer, delivering continuously microwave power with time, in contrast to traditional oven, which operate on a pulsed mode unless run at full power (Fig. 1B). In our case, four different powers were used: 100, 270, 300 and 440 W. The MW oven was modified similarly as described elsewhere [17,20]. A quartz tube was placed in the oven to accommodate the sorbent and catalyst bed, using PTFE (Teflon®) Swagelok fittings. Sorbent and catalyst beds were held with quartz wool plugs. Gases were flown through polyethylene tubing passing through 2 mm holes drilled in the oven cavity. The gas feed could be sent first through the sorbent and catalytic beds located in a microwave oven or directly into the IR gas analyzer, which consisted of a 10 cm pathlength IR gas cell (from Harrick) fitted in a Bruker Tensor 27. The gas cell was kept at 80 °C and 8 scans were averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1. A typical FT-IR transmission spectrum showing methane, CO and CO2 bands are given in Fig. 1C. IR Band assignment was ascertained via comparison to the NIST database [21]. CO2 and product concentrations were derived from calibration curves, using the area of the bands located at 670 cm−1 (for CO2), 3015 cm–1 (for methane) and 2145 cm–1 (for CO). The conversion of CO2 was calculated as the ratio between reacted CO2 and the inlet CO2, the reacted CO2 being the difference between the measured CO2 and the inlet CO2. The signal of the inlet CO2 was measured by by-passing the reactor. The yield of CO (or CH4) was calculated as the concentration of CO (or CH4) divided by that of reacted CO2. The release of adsorbed CO2 during the MW experiments could arise from different materials used. It must be stressed that no CO2 desorbed from SiC, even after exposure to 2 % CO2 for 5 min. The CO2 released from Fe3O4 and Co/Siralox determined by temperature desorption experiments carried out up to 600 °C were 74 and 22 µmol g−1, respectively. This shows that the main contributor to CO2 storage was the iron phase, followed by the Co/Siralox catalyst. Transient experiments in which CO2 was removed from the feed showed that a delay of 30 s needed to be subtracted to the time of the IR data to account for dead-volume purge (reactor + lines). This delay correction was applied to the data reported here. The purge of the gas-cell (17 mL of dead-volume) itself was not negligible at the flow rate of 50 mL/min used here. The gas-cell was purged at 75 % after ca. 20 s, hence any concentration modulation with similar or shorter periods will be significantly dampened. The illuminance of the reactor zone versus time under MW irradiation was measured with the light sensor from a mobile phone and the Arduino Science Journal application [22]. Measure temperatures in multimode MW ovens is difficult [23,24] and was not attempted here. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Activity of SiC and Fe3O4 under continuous flow conditions The activity of SiC and that of a mechanical mixture of SiC and Fe3O4 were first measured under a continuous flow of CO2 and H2. The samples were irradiated under a nominal power of 300 W over 300 s. No conversion of CO2 to CO or to CH4 were observed when using SiC alone ( Fig. 2A), in agreement with an earlier report [17]. In contrast, the mixture of SiC and Fe3O4 led to a major decrease of the CO2 concentration and to the formation of CO (Fig. 2B). The initial induction period of about 30 s was due to the time needed to achieve a sufficient increase of the temperature of the iron oxide under MW irradiation. Observing only CO as reaction products was consistent with the fact that iron oxides are highly active catalysts for the RWGS reaction (Eq. (2)), but not for CO x methanation [25]. The concentrations of CO measured over the first 230 s were actually higher than the 2 % of CO2 fed in the reactor (Fig. 2B). This excess CO x likely derived from the decomposition of carbonate species initially present at the surface of the samples, which had formed from atmospheric CO2 adsorption while handling the sample in air before the experiment. The plots of CO2 and CO concentrations versus time exhibited some oscillations (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the MW irradiation was not constant over time, as confirmed by visual observations of the sample black body radiation that varied during the experiments. This behavior was not expected since the “Inverter” MW technology is supposed to deliver a continuous irradiation over time, according to the manufacturer specifications. This point will be discussed in detail in Section 3.2. The conversion of CO2 over the mixture of SiC and Fe3O4 calculated over the 300 seconds of the experiment was about 84 % (Fig. 2A). The instantaneous CO2 conversion once the system reached steady-state (time under MW > 200 s) was about 95 % (Fig. 2B). This shows that CO2 could be readily converted under these conditions, except for the brief induction period. Yet, the absence of methane stressed that the hydrogenation ability was inadequate. It indicates that the iron oxides present could not be reduced to the carbide state, which is that active for CO hydrogenation (Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) [26,27]. The catalytic activity of a similar mass of Fe3O4 using the same reaction flow was also measured (in the absence of SiC) as a function of temperature in a conventional tubular furnace delivering heat through Joule effect. The CO2 conversion only reached 14 % at 550 °C, with CO being the sole product (Fig. 2C). The temperature required to achieve a conversion similar to those obtained in the MW experiment reported in Fig. 2B (ca. 95 %) was about 700 °C (determined by extrapolation of the Arrhenius plot). This value gives an estimate of the temperature obtained in the SiC + Fe3O4 mixture in the MW experiment at 300 W. 3.2 Activity of Co/Siralox, SiC and Fe3O4 under continuous flow conditions Metallic cobalt is highly active for the hydrogenation of CO [28] and CO2 [29] and thus a cobalt-based catalyst supported on Siralox was selected to achieve CO x hydrogenation. The cobalt oxide CoO was reported too as being active for CO2 hydrogenation [30]. The as-prepared Co/Siralox catalyst had been calcined and mostly exhibited Co3O4 as crystalline phase before use [19]. Unfortunately, the Co/Siralox did not heat up under MW irradiation and no catalytic activity could be observed when used alone (data not shown). Alumina and silica that make up the Siralox support are both poor MW susceptors at room temperature [14,31]. In contrast, cobalt oxides are strong MW absorbers [31,32], yet the concentration of those in the fresh catalyst appeared too low to induce sufficient heating. More, it was noted that by adding only 50 mg of Co/Siralox to a mixture of 200 mg of Fe3O4 and 100 mg SiC (corresponding to a dilution of 85 %) inhibited the heating ability of the latter. This observation stresses the difficulty in obtaining efficient susceptor mechanical combinations. A lay-out in which the Co/Siralox bed was physically separated from that of the SiC + Fe3O4 mixture was eventually used. The Co/Siralox was placed ca. 5 mm after the SiC + Fe3O4 mixture in the quartz reactor, separated by quartz wool ( Fig. 3A). The reactor was then irradiated by MW under a flow of CO2 and H2 at decreasing nominal powers from 440, 300, 270 and 100 W in consecutive experiments. The highest power used of 440 W led to an essentially continuous glow, while lower power settings at 300, 270 and 100 W induced a pulsed behavior of the sample brightness, as exemplified by the case at 270 W (Fig. 3B). A video comparing the emission observed in the four experiments can be viewed on-line or downloaded [33]. The pulsations were likely due to a discontinuous MW irradiation. The oscillations observed at lower powers were qualitatively characterized by measuring the illuminance of the reactor zone versus time under MW irradiation ( Fig. 4). The patterns of the illuminance were irregular and depended on the MW power applied. The illuminance observed at 440 W was always high after 20 s under irradiation, although it was uneven. The 300 W case consisted of long pulses that were briefly interrupted every 23 s. The 270 W case displayed pairs of pulses every 55 s, while the 100 W case exhibited brief periodic pulses (of weaker intensities) every 21 s. In conclusion, the present “Inverter” MW oven did not deliver continuous irradiation versus time at low powers, contrary to the manufacturer claims. Purge data discussed in the experimental section indicated that the gas-cell analyzer dead-volume required about 20 s to be flushed at 75 %. This indicated that any pulsation with a similar or shorter period, as those observed at 100 W (Fig. 4D) will be dampened. In contrast, the pulsation of 76 s observed in the case of the 270 W data (Fig. 3C) should still be clearly resolved. The corresponding concentrations of CO2 and reaction products CO and CH4 measured under MW irradiation are shown in Fig. 5. The initial lag times before observing any product were due to the time needed to purge the gas-cell dead-volume and heat up the materials present in the reactor. Methane and CO could be observed at each power used. The large carbon balance excess (sum of concentrations > 2 %) observed at 440 W (Fig. 5A) was due to the contribution of adsorbed carbonates, as discussed above. Carbon monoxide was the main reaction product in all cases and some unreacted CO2 could always be observed. The evolution of the concentrations of CO2, CO and CH4 observed at 440 W were complex (Fig. 5A). CO and CO2 levelled off after about 200 s, while CH4 somewhat slowly decayed. The observed trends are difficult to rationalize as those resulted from a combination of catalyst activation (cobalt oxide reduction), potential deactivation (e.g., sintering of the cobalt phases) and adsorption/desorption effects on the various solids present in the reactor whose temperature evolved differently. The Co/Siralox was actually heated indirectly through convection and radiation from the heat generated over the SiC + Fe3O4 mixture. In turn, the iron oxide probably got reduced to FeO or Fe, as observed in our earlier work [17]. The signals observed when subsequently irradiating at 300 W were steadier (Fig. 5B). The essential lack of signal oscillation indicates that the thermal inertia the catalysts and the dead-volume of the analyzer IR gas-cell averaged the power pulsation of the MW source (Fig. 4B). The CO concentration was about 4-fold higher than that of methane, stressing a poor methanation ability. The concentrations of CO2, CO and CH4 displayed strong oscillations at 270 W (Fig. 5C) and 100 W (Fig. 5D), due to the pulsed nature of the MW irradiations (Fig. 4C and D). CO was again the main reaction product as very little CH4 was formed. Averaged conversions of CO2 were calculated over the total duration of the experiment and appeared to depend on the MW power ( Fig. 6A). The conversion of CO2 was highest at 440 and 300 W, reaching 80 %. The highest selectivity to CH4 of 36 % was achieved at 440 W, likely associated with a higher bed temperature. The selectivity to methane dropped to 24 % at 300 W. Both CO2 conversion and selectivity to CH4 dropped further at 270 and 100 W, with methane representing less than 10 % of the converted CO2. The catalytic activity of a similar mass of Co/Siralox (in the absence of SiC and Fe3O4) using the same reaction flow was also measured in a conventional tubular furnace as a function of temperature. Methane was the main reaction product with a selectivity close to 90 % over the 200–500 °C range (Fig. 6B). This is in sharp contrast to the activity measured over the Fe3O4, which only led to CO (Fig. 2). The methane present was thus only formed on the Co/Siralox and the activity data reported in Fig. 6B can be used to estimate the Co/Siralox bed temperature in the MW experiments reported in Fig. 5 and 6A. The methane yield (= CO2 conversion × selectivity to methane) at 440 W was ca. 0.28, which corresponded to a temperature of ca. 260 °C in the conventional oven. The methane yield obtained at 100 W of ca. 0.04 corresponded to a temperature of ca. 200 °C. It stresses that the heat transfer between the red hot (> 700 °C) SiC + Fe3O4 mixture and the Co/Siralox bed was not very efficient. 3.3 CO2 trapping followed by desorption and methanation under MW Pulsed experiments were carried out during which CO2 adsorbed at 20 °C using 2 % CO2 + 20 % O2 in N2 for 5 min. This duration was sufficient to saturate the samples with CO2, as evidenced by the CO2 signal coming out from the reactor (data not shown). Molecular oxygen was added to the CO2 stream as O2 will be present alongside CO2 (and water) in realistic applications. The presence of O2 is a major challenge since it will invariably lead to the oxidation of cobalt, at least superficially. This will result in some additional H2 consumption to reduce the corresponding oxide back to the metallic state under methanation conditions and a delay before activity can be observed. Bulk and supported Co3O4 typically start reducing at around 300 °C [34,35]. The reactor was subsequently purged under N2 for 5 min, then left a further 5 min under 20 % H2 in N2 with a total flow of 50 mL min–1. The MW power was then turned on for 5 min under 20 % H2 in N2 while monitoring the reactor effluent. The evolution of CO2, CO and CH4 concentrations as a function of time under 100 W MW irradiation for three consecutive runs is given in Fig. 7. Concentrations oscillated due the non-continuous nature of the irradiation at the low powers, as discussed in Section 3.2. No CH4 was produced in the first 50 s, as CO2 was first released closely followed by CO. The temperature of Co/Siralox catalyst was initially insufficient to yield CH4 (Eq. (1)). CH4 appeared from 50 s and remained the main product from 100 seconds. The average selectivity to CH4 calculated over the 300 s experiment was similar over the three runs and was about 40 % ( Fig. 8), which was five-fold higher than that obtained under steady flow conditions at the same power of 100 W (Fig. 6). The amount of CO2 converted reached about 70 % (Fig. 8), which was much higher than that obtained under continuous flow conditions at 100 W (Fig. 6). Note that CO was always present under our experimental conditions. Future work should address minimizing CO formation by varying contact time through the H2 flow rate or pressure. 3.4 Discussion MW-assisted heterogenous catalysis is gaining momentum as MW heating is an efficient heating method, which can lead to significant reduction of energy consumption [13]. The present work shows that conversion of CO2 into CH4 over Co-based catalyst could be achieved under MW irradiation, which is promising for reducing energy costs of Power-to-CH4 applications. This is the first example of the application of a non-noble metal for the MW-assisted catalytic hydrogenation of CO2, to the best of our knowledge. We had reported earlier the utilization of a Ru-based catalyst for the same reaction in a traditional (non-inverter) domestic MW oven [17]. The utilization of a non-noble metal is a greater challenge, because base oxides are significantly harder to reduce than those of noble metals. The metal present will get oxidized under realistic CO2 trapping applications because of the presence of O2 and water. Ni-based catalysts are highly active for CO and CO2 hydrogenation [36], but were not selected here because of the propensity of Ni-based catalyst to form volatile Ni(CO)4 when exposed to CO below 150 °C [37,38]. This could have easily occurred here because part of the catalyst bed remained cold and would have been contacted by CO formed over the FeO x -containing bed. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of using an inverter domestic oven for MW-assisted catalysis. In contrast to the manufacturer claim, the MW irradiation appeared pulsed at low powers 100, 270 and 300 W. This was evidenced by the periodic variations of the sample emission (Figs. 3 and 4) and CO2, CO and CH4 concentrations (Fig. 5) as a function of time. The SiC + Fe3O4 mixtures were rapidly heated up to a red/orange glowing colors, indicating locations with temperature higher than 600 °C. Yet, the bed glow was not uniform, stressing that strong temperature gradient were present. A comparison of the activity of Fe3O4 and Co/Siralox measured in a traditional furnace indicated that the temperature of the iron-based material was in excess of 700 °C, while that experience by the Co/Siralox was below 300 °C. This stresses that the heat transfer between the two beds is limited and should be improved to achieve higher methanation activity. The MW-absorbing ability of the SiC + Fe3O4 mixtures was inhibited by diluting it down merely to 85 wt% with Co/Siralox. MW heating is known to be sensitive to grain size, morphology and contact point which could leads to “hot-spot” as shown in the case of SiC [39] and even grapes [40], even leading to plasma generation in the latter case. These observations stresses that the control of bed composition and packing are crucial for efficient heat generation from MW will require careful control if this technology is to be implemented. The catalytic performances were improved by operating in CO2 trapping/methanation mode (Fig. 8) as compared to a continuous flow mode (Fig. 6). Further investigations are required to optimize the materials to be used, e.g. nature of the MW absorber, CO2 sorbent and catalyst, possibly by considering combination of noble and base metal to alleviate the release of unreacted CO2 due to a slow reduction of cobalt oxide. 4 Conclusions Combinations of microwave absorbers (SiC, Fe3O4), CO2 adsorbents (Fe3O4), and Co/Al2O3 as CO2 methanation catalyst were investigated for the conversion of CO2 into CH4 through MW heating using a quartz plug flow reactor. The inverter-technology MW oven irradiation mode appeared pulsed at the lower power setting (below 440 W), in contrast to the manufacturer claims. CO2 reaction led to the formation of CO and CH4 to different extents depending on the MW power used. CO2 conversion raised up to 80 % under 440 W MW irradiation, although selectivity to CH4 was only about 35 %. The average selectivity to CH4 was increased 4-fold under trapping experimental conditions compared to continuous flow. Total selectivity to CH4 could not yet be achieved with the present Co-based catalyst and operating conditions. The release of unreacted CO2 at the start of the experiment was likely due to the slow kinetics of cobalt oxide reduction.

        "dc:description": "SiC and Fe3O4 were used as microwave (MW) susceptors in a novel type of domestic MW oven featuring the so-called “Inverter” technology used for CO2 trapping and methanation. A catalyst based on cobalt was added and the conversion of CO2 was studied both in continuous mode (co-feeding H2 and CO2) and pulsed mode (sequential CO2 trapping and desorption/hydrogenation). CO2 conversion up to 80 % could be achieved over the physical mixture of SiC, Fe3O4 and Co/Al2O3, although high selectivities to CO were observed. The periodic glow of the susceptors and the corresponding oscillation of the catalytic activity at powers lower than 440 W revealed that MW power delivery was actually pulsed, unlike the manufacturer claim. Higher output power enabled both higher CO2 conversion rate and selectivity to CH4. The catalytic performances were improved by operating in CO2 trapping/methanation mode as compared to a continuous flow mode.",
