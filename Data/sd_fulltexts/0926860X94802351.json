Ind. Series Vol. 53), by J.R. Kosak and T.A. Johnson, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1993, ISBN 0-8247-9140-1, xviii+582 pp., $185.00. This book is a compilation of technical papers and posters presented at the 14th Conference on Catalysis of Organic Reactions, held in Albuquerque, N.M., in April 1992. It forms volume 53 of the Chemical Industries Series and is the seventh book with the same title (the previous were volumes 5, 18, 22, 33, 40 and 47 of the series). The book has a contents index and a list of contributors at the beginning and a useful subject index at the end. There are 47 contributions of different lengths (from three to 51 pages) but these are presented without following a similar style. Further, they are not separated into different sections according to their subjects, as was usual in the previous books of the series. About 80% of the papers are concerned with heterogeneous catalysis. The first eleven papers deal with several hydrogenation reactions and they are more related to organic synthesis than to the catalytic phenomena or to the catalyst. Other subjects are oxidation (e.g. of glucose, of durene to pyromellitic acid), alkylation (e.g. of aromatic amines with aldehydes and with ketones, of anilines with p-isopropenylaniline to produce bisanilineA), hydrolysis (e.g. of haloaromatics to phenols), acylation (e.g. 1-methylcyclohexanol to 1-methylcyclohexyl acetate), amidation (e.g. of methyl esters with formamides), condensation (e.g. of !mine to 4-methyfthiazole), hydrogenolysis (e.g. of n-butane), cracking (e.g. of organic amides), etc. In general, these subjects are more related to the catalytic phenomena. There are descriptions of new catalyst materials used in the synthesis of a variety of new chemicals: titanium silicate molecular sieves for m-xylene isomerization and ethylbenzene cracking (Deeba et al.); copper aluminum borates, in which framework copper or aluminum are replaced with appropriate metals, for dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization reactions (Satek and McMahon); and copper-exchanged zeolites for the production of phenols from haloaromatics (Perot et al.). Many of the papers are written by industrial chemists and they are related to real problems faced in industry. Grate el al. describe in detail a new technology for the oxidation of olefins to carbonyls (ethylene to acetaldehyde and higher olefins to ketones) using a palladium and polyoxoanion catalyst system of which the preparation is described. This process presents advantages over the Wacker technology. Some of the papers offer a view of industrial process technologies for the synthesis of valuable chemicals: m-aminophenol, n-butyl-l-deoxynojirimycin, S-Naproxen, peptide mimics, gluconic acid, 4-methyl4hiazole, etc. A couple of papers are related to the characterization of catalysts and one of them (Augustine et al.) describes an apparatus forthe study of hydrogenation reactions. One author (Manzer) refers to catalytic synthesis of chlorofluo- rocarbon alternatives to protect the ozone layer. applied catalysis A: General Volume 112 No. 2 - 26 May 1994 N27 The book is worth reading for those working in catalysis and should be especially useful on the shelf of libraries dealing with organic catalytic synthesis. Santa Fe N. FIGOLI 8 April 1994 Tailpiece Early Work on Ammonia Synthesis in the US: Part II Youthful Training of an Innovator (J) All too frequently a discovery is heralded but the discoverer receives little or no attention. For example, the Haber process lives on in chemistry texts but the complex and interesting personality as well as the values of the inventor do not survive as well. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the individual and the accomplishment we should consider them in the light of the times that they receive their training, conduct their research and make the discoveries. This is a most difficult task. It is easier to consider the individual in today's light and thereby obtain some understanding of changes that have occurred. As we look at the early years of Cottrell, a very successful innovator, we should consider how he would fit into the training today's youth receives and whether society can accept today such an unique person. Cottrell was certainly not the typical child. The school he attended was opened by Miss Sarah Horton; she intended that the school help its pupils to lay the foundation of a general culture. During his early school years, he completed Miss Horton's homework assignments while his Aunt Mame read to him from Harper's Young People or the Scientific American. His powers of maintaining divided attention permitted him to absorb both. He could immediately prompt Aunt Mame to the exact point where she had left off reading to him the previous evening. Today, one hundred years later, the youth in even the most underdeveloped nation would be plugged into a headset listening to \"modern music\" rather than science. Harpers Magazine at that time included an \"Amateur's Workshop\" column. Cottrell followed instructions, while still in elementary school, contained in it for building his own camera, and then started a business of photographing real estate. He made enough doing this to purchase a better camera. Cottrell soon turned his attention to electricity, and at eleven he was making a dynamo, medical battery and an induction coil to carry out experimental work with them. At the young age of thirteen, Cottrell and a friend were publishing the \"Boy's Workshop\", a four page newspaper that was mailed to subscribers every Monday. The first issue stated its policy as: \"Having dedicated this to the public in general and boys in particular we wish to say that it will be devoted chiefly to the description of easily and cheaply constructed apparatus.\" A subscription cost $0.50 for six months, and advertising was a dollar an inch - prices that were, in 1900, on the expensive side. The first issue contained five advertisements. The publication was soon granted second-class mailing privileges by the Oakland applied catalysis A: General Volume 112 No. 2-26 May 1994 APCATA 94802351 0926-860X(94)80235-1 10.1016/0926-860X(94)80235-1 Elsevier Science B.V.
