Tel.: +43-316-873-84-58; fax: +43-316-815-886 The synthesis and characterization of metathesis polymers functionalized with triethyleneoxy-methylether and crown-ether side groups is reported. The triethyleneoxy-methylether substituted norbornene and acetylene derivatives and the 14-crown-4 functionalized norbornene were synthesized and metathesis polymerization with carbene complexes of molybdenum or ruthenium provided the substituted polynorbornene or polyacetylene backbone. The polymers were characterized with NMR, GPC, FT-IR and DSC. Addition of lithium ions to these amorphous polymers results in increasing of the glass transition temperature, T g, because the oxygen–metal coordination leads to an enhanced order. The triethyleneoxy-methylether-bearing polymers show a low T g even at high O:Li ratios. This is in contrast to the crown-ether-modified polynorbornene where the crown-ether ring stiffens the main chain and leads to higher T g. Keywords Metathesis polymerization Crown-ether Poly(ethyleneoxide) PEO Polymer electrolytes 1 Introduction The use of polymeric materials bearing oligoethyleneoxy or crown-ether side chains as solid electrolytes is well described [1–3]. Such ionically conducting materials continue to be studied because of various technological applications such as low weight, all solid-state lithium batteries, polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) or sensors [4,5]. Since 1973, when Fenton et al. [6] first reported the ionic conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and the following suggestion of Armand [7] for the use of PEO as a solid electrolyte system, much work has been reported on this field. In pure PEO the dissolution of lithium ions causes a considerable increase in glass transition temperature T g because the lithium ions cross-link the PEO chains and the increased order diminishes the ionic mobility. Various attempts have been made to modify PEO by plasticizers, cross-linking, or grafting to improve the properties [8]. The aim was to get a noncrystalline polymeric material wherein lithium addition is not accompanied by an increase in T g above room temperature. This is important because ion conduction takes place in the amorphous regions of the polymer where the ion transport is assisted by the liquid-like chain relaxation processes occurring in the polymer above its glass transition temperature [3]. It is desired to produce polymeric materials with high stereoregularity because such highly ordered structures give the possibility for the oligo(ethyleneoxide) units to arrange in regular tunnels. Such “ion channel formation” is assumed to be responsible for the high ion conductivity in polymer gel electrolytes [8]. In these systems ion transport does not depend directly on chain flexibility [3]. Also, crown ethers have been found to be excellent cation binding agents and it is desired to form regular stacks of the crown structures for building up an oxygen coated tunnel which works as an ion conductor. 14-Crown-4 is known to form relatively strong 1:1 complexes in which the lithium ion sits in the plane of the ring [9]. The monomers and their method of synthesis are shown in Fig. 1 . By the ring-opening metathesis polymerization [10] of the norbornene derivatives using well-defined molybdenum or ruthenium carbene complexes [11,12] we hoped to obtain polymers with high stereoregularity. In addition due to the nonpolar main chain a self-assembling of the polar moieties could be possible. By metathesis polymerization of acetylene derivatives [13–15] with molybdenum carbene complexes it is possible to get a polyacetylene main chain with a high density of the triethyleneoxy-methylether side chains. In this case the advantage should be to combine a rigid, stiff and nonpolar backbone with a cover of regular, polar side chains. We studied the microstructure of the polymers obtained with different catalysts and finally we investigated the thermal behavior after lithium salt addition. We could show that it is possible to produce polymers with a regular, nonpolar backbone via metathesis polymerization and that the polar side chains are able to dissolve high amounts of Li salts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and analysis THF was purified by distillation from Na/K alloy. Dichloromethane was distilled from CaH2 prior to use. Propargyl alcohol and the methoxy-triethylene-glycol were ordered from Fluka and used as received. The molybdenum carbene complexes were prepared as described in the literature [11]. The ruthenium benzylidene catalyst was obtained from Strem Chemicals. All polymerizations were carried out in a dry box filled with nitrogen. All monomers were degassed before the transfer into the dry box. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 300-MHz Bruker MSL, Varian Gemini 200 or a 90-MHz Bruker WH-52 spectrometer. Glass transition temperatures were measured by differential scanning calorimetry with a Perkin-Elmer DSC 4 (20°C/min) or a Polymer Laboratories simultaneous thermal analysis STA 625 (15°C/min). Molecular weights were determined, relative to polystyrene standards, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of THF or chloroform solutions of the polymer using a UV or refractive index detector. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FTIR as thin films on NaCl plates. 2.2 Synthesis of monomers The starting materials for the monomer synthesis were the alcohols 1, 2 and 3 . Compounds ANC3 ANC1 were synthesized according to literature [16]. The introduction of the oligoethyleneoxy functionalities was achieved by etherification of the various alcohols with triethylene-glycol-ditosylate or the tosylate of the triethylene-glycol-monomethylether [17] using sodium hydride or potassium hydroxide as a base and THF as a solvent in order to obtain monomers ANC2 ANC4 and gel permeation chromatography. The reaction of the disodium salt of the bis-5,6-(hydroxymethyl)-norbornene 3 with the triethylene-glycol ditosylate was made under high dilution conditions (THF solution) to obtain the norbornene-14-crown-4 in 22% yield. Description of the syntheses in detail: 2.2.1 5-{2-[2-(2-Methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethoxymethyl}-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene 1a (endo, exo mixture) A 60% sodium hydride suspension in mineral oil (0.45 g, 0.011 mol) was washed several times with dry THF. THF (50 ml) were added to the sodium hydride and warmed slightly. A solution of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-norbornene 1 (0.57 g, 0.004 mol) in 3 ml dry THF was added (bubbling). The mixture was heated until reflux and a solution of methoxy-triethylene-glycol tosylate (1.9 g, 0.006 mol) in 5 ml dry THF was added with a syringe. The mixture was stirred under reflux overnight. After cooling the solid salts were removed by filtration and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to get a slightly yellow colored oil which was purified by column chromatography on silica (eluent: cyclohexane/ethylacetate= 3/1) to yield a colorless oil (0.79 g, 64 %, endo, exo mixture 2:1). δ H (CDCl3): 6.10 (m), 5.92 (m), 3.55–3.65 ( 14 H, m), 3.4 (3 H, s), 3.12 (2 H, m), 2.9 (1 H, b s), 2.78.

Methoxy-triethylene-glycol tosylate (4.3 g, 0.013 mol) was added and the mixture was stirred 5 h at room temperature. During this time a white solid precipitates. Hydrochloric acid was added and the mixture was extracted three times with diethylether. The organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to get a slightly colored liquid which was purified by vacuum distillation (b.p. 175°C/0.2 mm Hg). Yield: 1.55 g (59%). δ H (CDCl3): 4.18 (2 H, d), 3.67 (10 H, m), 3.58 (2 H, m), 3.35 (3 H, s), 2,42 (1 H, t) ppm. δ C(CDCl3): 79.69, 74.55, 71.96, 70.63 (2 C), 70.59, 70.44, 69.14, 59.07, 58.43 ppm. 2.2.3 Endo, exo-4,7,10,13-tetraoxa-tricyclo[14.2.1.02,15]nonadec-17-ene 3a A 60% sodium hydride suspension in mineral oil (0.5 g, 0.0125 mol) was washed several times with dry THF. THF (100 ml) was added to the sodium hydride and heated until reflux. A solution of bis-5,6-(hydroxymethyl)-norbornene (0.5 g, 0.00325 mol) in 3 ml dry THF was added with a syringe. After 10 min a solution of triethylene-glycol ditosylate (1.5 g, 0.00325 mol) in 150 ml of dry THF was added slowly during the next 3 h. The reaction mixture was kept under reflux for 3 days. After cooling the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the white solid was extracted with 100 ml chloroform. After filtration the solvent was again removed and the residual oil was purified by column chromatography on silica (eluent: cyclohexane/ethylacetate=4:1) to get a colorless oil. Yield: 0.192 g (22%). δ H (CDCl3): 6.08 (2 H, t), 3.55–3.7 (12 H, m), 3.45 (2 H, m), 3.18 (2 H, m), 2.84 (2 H, b s), 2.44 (2 H, m), 1.39 (2 H, dd) ppm. δ C (CDCl3): 135.38 (2 C), 71.6–71.9 (8 C), 49.78, 45.90 (2 C), 42.27 (2 C) ppm. 2.3 Polymerization The monomers ANC2 ANC4 ANC5 were polymerized using well-defined molybdenum (Mo1, Mo2) or ruthenium carbene (Ru) complexes (Fig. 2) . In a typical polymerization procedure the monomer (1 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml dichloromethane and a solution of the catalyst (0.003 mmol) was added. In the case of the molybdenum catalyst after 2 h benzaldehyde was added to quench the reaction. After 10 min the reaction mixture was filtered through a silica column in order to remove the molybdenum. By pouring the polymer solution in pentane the highly viscous (1b, 2b, 4b) or solid (3b) polymer could be separated (Fig. 3) . In the case of Ru after 2 h ethyl vinyl ether was added as a quenching reactant. After 1 h the polymer solution was poured into pentane. A highly viscous (1b) or solid (3b) polymer precipitated. 2.4 Lithum salt complexation Lithium addition was carried out in the dry box filled with nitrogen as follows. Fifty milligrams polymer (5% solution in THF) was weighed into a 10-ml flask equipped with a stirrer bar. The amount of anhydrous lithium perchlorate required to give the desired O:Li ratio (varies from 40:1 to 4:1) was added as a stock solution containing 100 mg/g THF. After 1 h stirring the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the sample was dried under vacuum at 40°C for several hours. This was repeated for each different O:Li ratio and differential scanning calorimetric analyses were carried out. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Polymerization Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the norbornene derivatives ANC2 ANC5 was achieved with catalyst Mo1, Mo2 and Ru. With all catalysts we obtained the polymers 1b and 3b in quantitative yield under mild conditions (room temperature, 2 h). The copolymer 4b was produced with catalyst Mo2 and a 1:1 mixture of the monomers ANC2 ANC5 with 75% yield. Metathesis polymerization of the acetylene derivative 2a was achieved using catalyst Mo1 [14]. The polymerization reaction was carried out in a 10% monomer solution for 16 h (monomer:catalyst=100:1). We obtained a maximum yield of 85% of the polymer 2b which showed low molecular weight. The polymer structures are shown in Fig. 3. The data from GPC and DSC analyses are reported in Table 1 . 13C and 1H NMR studies of the obtained polymers provide elucidation of the microstructure [18,19]. Polymer 1b synthesized by Ru showed an amount of about 70% trans double bonds in the backbone. The trans vinylene units were found in the 1H NMR at 5.33 ppm and cis at 5.23 ppm (Fig. 4) . With catalyst Mo1 we obtained nearly the same microstructure (about 80% trans). Employing Mo2 as catalyst resulted in a polymer with a cis content >95%. 3a polymerized with Ru gave a polymer with 82% trans vinylene units, whereas Mo2-initiated polymerization resulted in a 75% cis polymer. Here trans and cis vinylene units were, in 1H NMR, nearly at the same chemical shifts (trans 5.44 ppm, cis 5.40 ppm). For determination of the cis/trans ratio the peaks at 3.0 ppm (cis) and 2.65 ppm (trans) were integrated. In 13C NMR we were not able to resolve the vinylene units clearly by using the Bruker 300 MSL. Further investigations are going on. The NMR analysis of copolymer 4b showed AB blocks in the backbone. In the 13C NMR only the signals of the homopolymers were visible. GPC nevertheless showed a monodispersed polymer with an M w of 55000 and a PDI of 2.3. We assume that a block copolymer is formed due to a higher rate of incorporation of the monosubstituted norbornene derivative 1a . Thus, after the formation of a block of mainly 1a units, units of 2a began to be incorporated in the polymer main chain. In the 1H NMR analysis of polyacetylene 2b a broad signal of the olefinic hydrogen at 6.3 was found. No separated peaks for cis or trans double bonds were observable. In Fig. 5 the FT-IR spectra of monomer 2a and polymer 2b are shown. The UV spectrum of 2b showed an absorption maximum at 245 nm and is illustrated in Fig. 6 . 3.2 Lithium complexation studies Addition of anhydrous lithium perchlorate to the polymers 1b–4b resulted in an increase in the glass transition temperatures because the oxygen–metal coordination leads to an enhanced order (Fig. 7) . The triethyleneoxy-methylether functionalized polymers remained in the amorphous phase even at high O:Li ratios and DSC measurements showed that T g was still below room temperature. We were not able to determine a T g of the crown-ether functionalized polymer even at very low Li:O ratio (1:40=one Li per 10 rings) because decomposition took place below the T g. We assume that the building of strong 1:1 complexes of crown ether and lithium cation is responsible for the drastic increase of T g. During lithium addition to the rigid crown-ether polymers (T g=78°C) we could observe that at an oxygen to lithium ratio of 12:1 the polymers become insoluble in THF. This was the reason for preparing the copolymer 4b which consisted of about 35% of crown-ether moieties. We can see that the increase in T g in polymer 4b is more sensitive to the amount of added lithium than in polymer 1b. We assume that this is due to the crown-ether compound. We could also detect the oligo-ethyleneoxy–lithium salt complexes interacting by IR measurements of polymer 2b and the corresponding lithium doped sample (Fig. 8) . The coordination between the cation and the ether oxygens was proved by a broadening of the C–O–C stretching and the shifting to lower wave numbers [8]. 4 Conclusions We have shown that it is possible to prepare metathesis polymers with a polynorbornene or polyacetylene main chain and triethyleneoxy-methylether or crown-ether side chains with defined microstructure. These polymers are able to dissolve high amounts of lithium salt. The increase in T g is low using polymer 1b and 2b bearing triethyleneoxy-methylether side groups. Crown-ether-containing polymers 3b and 4b show higher T g values after incorporating lithium ions. Acknowledgements The authors thank the “SFB Elektroaktive Stoffe” for supporting this work.
