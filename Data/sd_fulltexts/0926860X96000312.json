Liu, G.D. Lei, W.M.H. Sachtler * V.N. lpatieff Laboratory, Center for Catalysis and Surface Science, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2137 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA Abstract Skeletal isomerizations of n-pentane and n-butane have been studied at 11 bar in a microflow reactor over platinum containing sulfated zirconia (Pt-SZ) catalysts. The isomerization rate of n-pentane is about seven times higher than that of n-butane; selectivity to i-pentane is 91.6% at p(H2) = 2.2 bar. Hexanes and butanes are the main byproducts of pentane isomerization; the C6/C4 ratio is 0.91. Upon increasing the H2 pressure from 2.2 to 6.1 bar, the isomerization rate of n-butane decreases markedly (nH2 < -- 1.1), but that of n-pentane only marginally ((nil2 = 0). Both changes are perfectly reversible. Kinetic analysis reveals that the major mechanism of C4 isomerization is inter-molecular, but that of C5 isomerization is intra-molecular. With n-pentane, small amounts of hexanes and butanes are formed in a parallel, apparently inter-molecular reaction, one presumably involving a C10 intermediate. The qualitative difference between the isomerization mechanisms of butane and pentane parallels the known chemistry in liquid superacids. Catalysis via \"chemisorbed carbenium ions\" on heterogeneous catalysts thus strongly resembles catalysis via \"solvated carbenium ions\" in liquid acids.

Introduction The skeletal isomerization mechanism of small hydrocarbons has been stud- ied extensively in liquid superacids and was found to proceed via a protonated cyclopropane intermediate [1,2]. For C5+ hydrocarbons, this path avoids the energetically prohibitive stage of a primary carbenium ion. In the case of n-butane, however, opening of the protonated methyl cyclopropane ring still * Corresponding author.

Liu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 165-180 leads to a primary carbenium ion. Therefore isomerization of n-butane to i-butane in liquid acids is negligible under conditions where C5+ hydrocarbons swiftly isomerize. Likewise, over the solid catalyst Pt/AI203-SiO2, the isomer- ization rate of n-butane at 573K has been reported to be much slower than that of n-pentane [3]. For hydrocarbon isomerization over solid acid catalysts it has often been assumed that the mechanistic principles found to be valid in liquid super acids can be applied. However, this view has been challenged by Kazansky, who showed that \"chemisorbed carbenium ions\", e.g., in zeolites, form strong, covalent bonds between carbon atoms of the sorbate and oxygen ions of the surface [4]. \"Chemisorbed carbenium ions\" thus are in fact alkoxygroups at the catalyst surface. The polarity of such chemisorption complexes is low. Only the transition state for the chemisorption of an olefin on a \"surface proton\" (in reality the H-end of a surface O-H group with small dipole moment, hut high polarizability) has a higher polarity with a positive adsorbate. Kazansky's calculations also suggest that in these transition states the bond between one carbon atom and the \"surface proton\" is already quite short, whereas the distance between the adjacent carbon atom and the surface oxygen ion is still rather long. This lends some justification to the view that the known chemistry of carbenium ions might be applied to rationalize observed catalysis on solid acids. It is therefore of interest to define the limits of this analogy between isomerization in liquid acids via \"free\" or solvated carbenium ions and isomerization over solid acids via \"chemisorbed carbenium ions\". To this end a systematic comparison of the isomerization of butane and pentane appears promising. As mentioned, these isomerizations are qualitatively different in liquid superacids as a consequence of the large energy difference between primary carbenium ions and protonated cyclopropane ring ions. Solid acids based on sulfated zirconia, SZ, with the zirconia in the tetragonal structure, are remarkably active catalysts for the isomerization of light alkanes at low temperature. The finding by Hsu et al. [5] that some promoted SZ catalysts are able to catalyze butane isomerization at low temperature with an activation energy of only 44.8 kJ mol- ~ is obviously inconsistent with the assumption of a primary carbenium ion intermediate. Indeed, research on the reaction mecha- nism by Adeeva et al. [6] with double-labelled n-butane, 13CH3-12CH2- 12CH2-13CH3, unequivocally showed that butane isomerization over such cata- lysts follows a different route: an adsorbed oligomer is formed, probably a C8 adsorbate, which isomerizes and dissociates into i-butyl fragments which leave the catalyst surface as i-butane molecules. The reaction is thus an inter-molecu- lar process. Spectroscopic analysis of the acid sites in promoted and unpromoted SZ catalysts by FTIR (using CO to probe Lewis acid sites and CH3CN to probe BrCnsted acid sites) and solid state proton NMR showed that the Br~nsted sites are weaker acids than protons in H-ZSM-5, and that the Lewis sites are weaker H. Liu et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 165-180 167 acids than exposed A13+ ions in the surface of dehydrated alumina [7,8]. The unusual catalytic activity of the SZ based catalysts is therefore not caused by superacidity, but by the low Gibbs free energy of the transition state. In analogy to Kazansky's [4] and van Santen's [9] conclusions for acid zeolites, it has been speculated that the surface intermediates on SZ form chemical bonds between C atoms and O= ions bridging between a Zr4+ ion and a S6+ ion. The formation of a C8 intermediate from n-butane implies that part of the alkane is dehydrogenated to butene. Accordingly, the reaction order in H2 is negative over SZ [10]. The equilibration between butane and butene is even faster in the presence of platinum; in a previous study it was shown that in the presence of H2 at a total pressure of 11 bar and in the temperature range of 450-550 K a Pt-promoted SZ catalyst displays an extremely stable operation over days; consequently a very precise determination of the kinetic parameters is possible [11]. Therefore, platinum promoted sulfated zirconia, further to be called Pt-SZ, has been used as the catalyst for the present comparison of the isomerizations of n-butane and n-pentane. Previously, Garin et al. had demon- strated the effects of H2 pressure and Pt addition to SZ catalysts [12,13]. Under the conditions used here it is known from the results with double J3C labelled butane and the strongly negative reaction order in H2, that isomeriza- tion of n-butane to i-butane proceeds via a bimolecular reaction path. From the analogy with the chemistry in strong liquid acids, it appears plausible that the C8 intermediate easily isomerizes; rapid [3-fission of the 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane ion results in two i-C4 fragments. The description of the experimental results on n-butane isomerization over Pt-SZ in ref.[ll] will not be repeated here; the isomerization kinetics of n-pentane is studied under the same conditions and in the same reactor as was used for the n-butane work. The Pt-SZ catalyst with 0.38 wt% of Pt is the same as in the previous study [11]. The primary objective of the present research is to identify gradual or qualitative differences in the isomerization kinetics of these molecules. 2. Experimental Catalysts were prepared by sequentially impregnating Zr(OH)4 (kindly pro- vided by Magnesium Elektron) with Pt and SO4 ions, using procedures previ- ously reported [14]. After drying overnight at 383 K, 10 g of this solid was slurried with 20 cm3 of an aqueous solution of H2PtC16 containing 0.05 g Pt and stirred for 300 s. After filtration and drying of the solid overnight at 383 K it was added to 22 cm3 of 1 N sulfuric acid. After 300 s the slurry was filtered and the solid dried overnight at 383 K, followed by calcination in flowing dry air at 923 K for 4 h. The samples were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. The Pt-SZ catalyst was found to contain 0.38 wt% Pt and 1.8 wt% S. 168 H. Liu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 165-180 The reaction was studied in a downflow fixed bed microflow reactor (Max II, Xytel Corp.) which follows the design by Snel [15]. Catalyst samples (0.50 g) were loaded in a 9 mm i.d. steel reactor. They were heated in flowing hydrogen (1.7 cm3 s-~; Matheson, UHP) to 513 K within 2 h and held at 513 K for 2 h. Helium (Matheson, UHP) and a feed of n-pentane (0.988 vol% n-pentane, 10.4 vol% H2, and He balance; Matheson, certified std. 3 components) or n-butane (1.91 vol% n-butane, 20.1 vol% H2, and He balance; Matheson, certified std. 3 components) were subsequently introduced into the H2 stream; the flow-rates were adjusted to give the desired pressures of H2 and n-pentane or n-butane at a constant total pressure of 11 bar and a constant total flow-rate of 5 cm3 s- ~. In a series of experiments over Pt-SZ, the partial pressure of one feed component, hydrogen or n-pentane, was varied at constant overall flow-rate, while the partial pressure of the other reactant was kept constant by adapting the helium make-up. From the resultant changes in conversion and production rates the reaction orders in hydrogen and n-pentane were determined. The reactions were carried out at 479 K over Pt-SZ catalyst. The effluent was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography with a 50 m X 0.2 mm capillary column of PONA (Hewlett-Packard) attached to a FID detector.

Total pressure 11 bar: p(n-C4) 0.11 bar, p(n-C5) 0.054 bar, p(H2) 2.2-6.6 bar, helium balance. Increasing the hydrogen pressure from 2.2 bar to 6.1 bar leads to a slight decrease in the rates of n-pentane conversion and i-pentane formation, but causes a marked decrease in the rates of butane and hexane formation. The formation rate of the smaller molecules C1, C2 and C3 increases slightly. The \"Guldberg-Waage\" or \"power rate law\": r = kpm(H2)P\"(n-CsHl2) (1) has been used to compute the reaction orders in hydrogen. The results are listed in Table 2. The orders in hydrogen are nearly zero (slightly negative) for conversion of n-pentane, the formation of i-pentane and of the small molecules C j, C2 and C3. For the formation of butane and hexane, the orders in hydrogen are distinctly negative ( < - 1). The effects of hydrogen on the isomerization rate of n-butane and the formation of the products of C4 conversion are markedly different from those observed with n-pentane. With butane, an increase of p(H2) from 2.2 bar to 6.6 bar leads to a marked decrease in the rates of n-butane conversion and of i-butane formation; also the formation of the C5 byproduct is strongly affected. Only the formation rate of (Cl + C2) remains nearly constant, while the rate of propane formation decreases very slightly. Accordingly, the orders in hydrogen, listed in Table 2, are distinctly negative for n-butane conversion, i-butane formation and pentane formation [11]. 172 H.

The role of alkene in the isomerization of alkane An important finding of this study is the strikingly different reaction order in hydrogen for the isomerization of these homologue alkanes. The order is 174 H.

For hexane isomerization over Pt-SZ, Iglesia et al. report a positive reaction order in hydrogen [14]. For n-butane over SZ at lower pressure than used in [11] and in the present study, Garin et al. reported a negative reaction order in H2 at high H2/C4 ratios, but a positive order at very low ratios [12]. In catalytic reforming a positive hydrogen order is usually rationalized by removing the coke precur- sors from the catalyst. In ref. [14] a rate limiting alkane desorption step is assumed to be responsible for the positive order in hydrogen. It is remarkable that isomerization of butane, the only alkane which, in liquid superacids, can be isomerized only via a primary carbenium ion [1,2], displays a kinetic signature that differs from that for the isomerization of pentane and hexane. In our previous paper [11] arguments were presented that the negative reaction order in hydrogen is due to a pre-equilibrium between butane, butene and hydrogen. Over Pt containing catalysts this hydrogenation/dehydrogenation equilibrium will be established both for C4 and C5 molecules: C4H8 4- H2 ~ C4HI0 or CsHl0 + H2 ~ CsHj2 (2) Figs. 9 and 10 show that i-pentane formation from n-pentane correlates linearly to n-pentane pressure but not to n-pentene pressure.

This suggests that in pentane conversion an intermediate of pentene is not required for i-pentene formation, but that the formation of butane and hexane do require an unsaturated intermedi- ate such as pentene. It appears likely that this minor side reaction follows a bimolecular mechanism and a C 10 intermediate is involved. 4.2. Mechanism of n-pentane isomerization Whereas reactions in liquid acids can be described in terms of \"free carbenium ions\", reactions at the surface of solid acid catalysts proceed via chemisorbed complexes. The present results give some indication on the extent of similarity between \"free\" and \"chemisorbed\" carbenium ions. In terms of the carbenium ion model, an intra-molecular isomerization mechanism will involve secondary C~- ions as in liquid acids. These can be formed in three ways: (1) carbonium ion formation, followed by release of H2. (2) H- release of pentane on a surface Lewis acid site [16] (3) interaction of pentene molecules with surface protons, H+. 176 H.

Isomerization of the secondary carbenium ion would then proceed via a protonated cyclopropane ring intermediate, followed by opening of this ring to a branched secondary carbenium ion which easily converts into a tertiary ion by simple hydride shift. The driving force for this sequence of steps is the conversion: n-CsH+l(sec.) = i-CsH~l(tert.) (4) As the energy difference between a secondary carbenium ion and a protonated cyclopropane ring intermediate is about 16 kJ mol-I [18], a low activation energy would be expected for these steps. H.

Hydrogen and platinum are not mentioned explicitely in this scheme but they act in at least two ways: (1) Prevailing in situ hydrogenation of coke precursors would imply a positive reaction order in hydrogen, as usually observed in catalytic reforming; (2) Though at high surface coverage with tertiary carbenium ions the hydride ion transfer step (4) will be the prevailing entry to the population of adsorbed secondary carbenium ions, some secondary carbenium ions might be formed by reaction of pentene molecules with \"surface protons\". As pentene will be in equilibrium with pentane and hydrogen, this would imply a negative reaction order in hydrogen. This negative order will, however, converge towards zero for high ratios of adsorbed carbenium ions to \"surface protons\". However a highly negative reaction order in hydrogen is expected for any inter-molecular isomerization mechanism. In this scenario, adsorbed C~- react with a pentene molecule to form an adsorbed C~-0 ion: n-CsH,o + CsH ~-l(sec.) : C,0H 2-1(sec.) (5) These ions can easily isomerize to any of the tertiary carbenium ions of this 178 H.

Some of them will undergo easy [3-fission either to two i-C5 fragments or to an i-C6 and an i-C4 fragment. When facing the experimental data with this sketchy analysis of the antici- pated reaction mechanism, the following picture emerges: (1) Under the conditions chosen in this work, catalyst deactivation is low. (2) For the isomerization of n-butane the kinetic data agree with the inter- molecular mechanism. The highly negative reaction order in hydrogen and the positive order in butene suggest that the inter-molecular route prevails. (3) In the case of pentane two mechanisms are operating in parallel. The intra-molecular isomerization mechanism prevails, with most of the i-pentane molecules being formed via adsorbed C5 carbocations, including secondary and tertiary ions and protonated dimethyl cyclopropane ions. A small minority is, however, formed by an inter-molecular route, i.e., via adsorbed C~-0 carboca- tions. These adsorbed C~0 entities have a finite chance to decompose into C4 + C6 fragments. As the intra-molecular mechanism provides the lion's share to the formation of i-pentane, the kinetic data for n-C5 conversion and i-C5 formation are those predicted for the intra-molecular mechanism. The C4 and C6 fragments, however, are formed via the inter-molecular mechanism, and therefore show the kinetic signature typical for that scenario. Actually, butane H. Liu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 165-180 179 and hexane are produced in nearly equimolar ratio at low hydrogen pressure (Table 1). The orders in hydrogen for butane and hexane formation are - 1.95 and - 1.12, respectively, in agreement with the inter-molecular mechanism. (4) The striking difference in isomerization mechanism between butane and pentane agrees perfectly with the expectations based on the chemistry of \"free carbenium ions\". Pentane is able to isomerize in an intra-molecular way via protonated cyclopropane rings and to avoid intermediate formation of primary carbenium ions. Butane does not have this opportunity: any intra-molecular isomerization mechanism necessarily leads to primary carbenium ions in one stage or the other. Only the inter-molecular route enables butane to isomerize by avoiding the energetically prohibitive stage of primary carbenium ions. (5) It is remarkable that for processes involving only \"chemisorbed carbe- nium ions\", which are stabilizied by strong covalent C-O chemisorption bonds, the catalysis still shows the familiar signature of \"free carbenium ions\". Apparently, stabilization by covalent chemisorption bonds does not wipe out the characteristic differences between primary, secondary, and teritary carbenium ions and protonated cyclopropane rings. 5. Conclusions The kinetic data over Pt-SZ show that the major mechanism of pentane isomerization is intra-molecular, not requiring pentene intermediates. For bu- tane isomerization the prevailing mechanism is an inter-molecular process, requiring butene intermediates. The cause for this qualitative difference is that intra-molecular isomerization of butane would requires primary carbenium ions, but the intra-molecular isomerization of pentane does not. Both molecules isomerize via protonated cyclopropane ring intermediates; in the case of butane, formation of an adsorbed C~- entity, followed by its isomerization and [3-fission to iso-C4 fragments, circumvents the energetically unfavo~:able step of opening a protonated methy-cyclopropane ion to form a primary carbenium ion. The present results thus show that for \"chemisorbed carbenium ions\" the chemistry of \"free carbenium ions\" also retains some validity.

Skeletal isomerizations of n-pentane and n-butane have been studied at 11 bar in a microflow reactor over platinum containing sulfated zirconia (PtSZ) catalysts. The isomerization rate of n-pentane is about seven times higher than that of n-butane; selectivity to i-pentane is 91.6% at p(H2)= 2.2 bar. Hexanes and butanes are the main byproducts of pentane isomerization; the C6/C4 ratio is 0.91. Upon increasing the H2 pressure from 2.2 to 6.1 bar, the isomerization rate of n-butane decreases markedly (nH2< −1.1), but that of n-pentane only marginally ((nH2≈ 0). Both changes are perfectly reversible. Kinetic analysis reveals that the major mechanism of C4 isomerization is inter-molecular, but that of C5 isomerization is intra-molecular. With n-pentane, small amounts of hexanes and butanes are formed in a parallel, apparently inter-molecular reaction, one presumably involving a C10 intermediate. The qualitative difference between the isomerization mechanisms of butane and pentane parallels the known chemistry in liquid superacids. Catalysis via “ chemisorbed carbenium ions” on heterogeneous catalysts thus strongly resembles catalysis via “ solvated carbenium ions” in liquid acids.
