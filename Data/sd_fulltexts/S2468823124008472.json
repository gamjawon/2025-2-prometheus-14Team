The influence of TiO2 band gap on structure and reactivity of the supported single ruthenium (Ru1) atom was studied by density functional theory calculations, utilizing Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 as model catalysts for CO2 methanation. The supports have band gaps of 2.39 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively. The band gap plays a significant role in electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) and the position of the d-band center of the Ru1 on the TiO2. The Ru1/3L-TiO2, the Ru1 catalyst supported on the 3L-TiO2 with a narrower band gap, shows enhanced EMSIs and a d-band center that is positioned farther from Fermi level, leading to lower charge density on the Ru1 and weaker adsorption of H2, CO2, and CO compared to the Ru1/2L-TiO2. CO2 methanation followed CO pathway, with the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* identified as the rate-determining step on the Ru1/nL-TiO2. The Ru1 catalyst supported on TiO2 with a narrower band gap is more favorable kinetically and thermodynamically for CO2 methanation, despite the band gap not altering the reaction pathway. Enhanced hydrogen mobility and a pronounced promotional effect of hydrogen on CO adsorption, due to the narrower band gap support, are key factors facilitating the easier hydrogenation of CO* on the Ru1/3L-TiO2.

It determines the fundamental physical characteristics such as photon excitation and electron transport. The method of band gap regulation is widely used in the rational design of catalysts for photocatalytic reactions [1,2]. The band gap effect of an oxide also found to have pivotal effect on the activity for some thermo-catalytic reactions such as the oxidation of propylene to acrolein on the bismuth molybdate catalysts [3] and CO oxidation on the NiO and CeO2 catalysts [4,5]. It was revealed that the smaller the band gap of the catalyst, the lower the activation energy for the reactions, and the higher the catalytic activity. Our density functional theory (DFT) studies using two-dimensional oxides 2L- and 3L-TiO2(110) as models provided the reason for the band gap control of adsorption energy as the occupation of the antibonding orbital of the adsorbate by electrons after molecular adsorption, leading to the adsorption energy being determined by the band gap, establishing a theoretical foundation for the application of band gap control in heterogeneous catalysis [6]. Previous studies have indicated a close relationship between the band gap of semiconductor oxides and their thermocatalytic reaction performance, suggesting that band gap control strategies can be used for the rational design of oxide catalysts. In recent years, the band gap of oxide supports was also reported to significantly affect structure and catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts. Wang and coworkers reported that the activation energy (Ea) of ammonia-borane hydrolysis on the single Rh atom supported on VO2 nanorods with metallic-to-insulating phase transition was highly correlated to the band gap of the supports: the apparent Ea for the metallic VO2-supported catalyst around 40 kJ mol-1 lower than that for insulating VO2-supported catalyst [7]. Fung and coworkers reported that the band gap of rutile-type MO2 supports can adjust the adsorption of CH4 on single-atom Pt sites: CH4 undergoes strong chemical adsorption on Pt single-atom sites of wide-bandgap supports such as TiO2, GeO2, and SnO2, while no chemical adsorption occurs on Pt single-atom sites of metallic supports like IrO2 and RuO2. The reason is that for semiconductor supports, the Pt dz2 empty orbital is positioned within the band gap, facilitating the acceptance of σ-orbital electrons from CH4; whereas for metallic supports, orbital interactions with the Pt dz2 empty orbital result in electron occupation, thus losing the adsorption capacity for CH4 [8]. Our previous work investigated the effect of band gap of two dimensional (2D) nL-TiO2 on the Pt single-atom site that replaces a surface fivefold Ti atom, and found that the adsorption energy, dissociation energy, and heterolytic cleavage activation energy of CH4 are all linearly correlated with the band gap of the nL-TiO2: the smaller the band gap of the nL-TiO2, the stronger the CH4 adsorption and the lower the activation energy [9]. Metal-support interactions (MSIs) and electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) are of fundamental importance in heterogeneous catalysis. The electronic structure of the prepared single-atom catalysts has been demonstrated to be readily adjustable through EMSIs, thereby enabling the development of high-performance catalysts [10]. The influence of band gap of oxide support on MSIs &EMSIs, the adsorption of reactants and reaction mechanisms over oxide-supported metal single atom catalysts still need to be further elucidated, although the above pioneered works. It is of significant theoretical and practical importance to investigate in depth the influence of oxide's band gap on structure and performance of single-atom catalysts. The CO2 methanation known as the Sabatier reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that converts CO2 and hydrogen into methane (CH4) and water, represented by the following equation: CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O, ΔH 298 K = −165 kJ mol−1. It is particularly crucial for the emerging application for the circular carbon economy, power to gas technology [11,12], and future space exploration missions [13]. Oxide-supported Ru-based catalysts have garnered significant attention for their catalytic activity for CO2 methanation due to their relatively high activity at low temperatures. The reactivity of Ru catalysts supported on TiO2 (Ru/TiO2) for the hydrogenation of CO2 is markedly influenced by the properties of the support, owing to the modification of MSIs [14]. Our recent experimental findings have reported that Ru/TiO2 catalysts exhibiting high low-temperature activity for CO2 methanation can be achieved by narrowing the band gap of the support [15]. Hence, in this work, we aim to elucidate the impact of the band gap of TiO2 support on the structure and reactivity of Ru single-atom (Ru1) catalysts. By employing Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 as model catalysts with distinct band gap of the support, we investigate how the support's band gap affects the MSIs & EMSIs, adsorption of reactants, reaction mechanism for CO2 methanation on the catalysts. 2 Computational method and model All computational simulations were performed utilizing the plane-wave based density functional theory (DFT) methodology as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [16,17]. The interactions between electrons and ions were described via the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach [18,19]. The exchange and correlation energies were accounted for with the generalized gradient approximation and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (GGA-PBE). The thresholds for energy and force convergence during the optimization of configurations were set to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The Grimme's DFT-D3 method [20] was employed for all calculations to accurately describe dispersion interactions. Furthermore, spin polarization and dipole corrections along the vacuum-layer direction were taken into consideration. The charge transfer was conducted using the Bader charge analysis method. Previous studies have indicated that the band gap of two-dimensional (2D) nL-TiO2(110) exhibits an odd-even oscillation pattern that correlates with the thickness of the layers. Specifically, the band gap diminishes for even-numbered layers and augments for odd-numbered layers [9]. In this work, 2L- and 3L-TiO2, which possess the largest and smallest band gap values respectively, were chosen as supports for a single Ru atom (Ru1). The calculated band gaps for 2L- and 3L-TiO2 were determined to be 2.39 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively. The Monkhorst-Pack grid employed was 4 × 2 × 1 for both 2L- and 3L-TiO2, and a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was utilized. On-site Coulombic interactions, particularly relevant for Ti 3d electrons, were addressed using the DFT + U method with U set to 2 eV [21]. Simulations of the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 structures were conducted using a (2 × 2) slab model, which include a thickness equivalent to two or three O-Ti-O trilayers (Fig. 1 ). A vacuum space of 15.0 Å was adopted between the slabs to prevent interactions. Our previous research [6] confirms that the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 structures can remain stable without undergoing structural reconstruction. These surfaces consist of twofold-coordinate bridging oxygen atoms (O2f), threefold-coordinate oxygen atoms (O3f), and fivefold-coordinate titanium atoms (Ti5f). It is evident that while the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 share the same geometric configuration, they exhibit distinct band gap characteristics, which are ideal models for understanding the band gap effect on the structure and reactivity for it and its supported metal catalysts [6,9]. The binding energy (Eb), which serves as a metric for the stability of Ru1 supported on various TiO2 surfaces, is defined by the equation Eb = ERu/support – Esupport − ERu. In this equation, ERu/support, Esupport and ERu denote the energies of the Ru/support, the nL-TiO2 (110) support, and the isolated Ru atom, respectively. The adsorption energy is calculated by the formula Eads = Eadsorbate‑Ru/support − ERu/support – Eadsorbate, where Eadsorbate‑Ru/support, ERu/support and Eadsorbate are the energies of the adsorption system, the pristine Ru/support, and the isolated gas-phase molecule, respectively. An adsorption energy that is negative signifies an exothermic interaction. Transition state (TS) structures were elucidated employing the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [22] and confirmed by only one imaginary frequency. The activation energy (Ea) and the reaction energy (ΔE) are delineated as Ea = ETS - EIS and ΔE = EFS - EIS, respectively. Here, EIS, EIS and EFS sequentially represent the energies of the initial state (IS), the transition state (TS), and the final state (FS) for an elementary reaction step. The vacuum energy level (Evac) is taken as the reference zero-energy value for all systems and is computed using the formula Evac = Ef + W, where Ef and W correspond to the Fermi level and the work function, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The structure and metal-support interactions of Ru1 on the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 To identify the most stable configurations for Ru1 binding on the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 surfaces, a variety of potential sites, including the top and bridged O2f sites, were evaluated. The favored binding site for Ru1 was found to be the bridging site between two O2f atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 2 a and b. The binding energy of Ru1 on the 2L- and 3L-TiO2 surfaces was calculated at −3.37 and −4.37 eV, respectively. This indicates that the 3L-TiO2, with smaller band gap, exhibits a stronger binding capacity compared to the 2L-TiO2. Two Ru-O2f bonds are formed with bond lengths of 1.964 Å on the 2L-TiO2 and 1.836 Å on the 3L-TiO2. The corresponding charge transfer from Ru to the support was 0.63 e for the 2L-TiO2 and 1.01 e for the 3L-TiO2. This demonstrates that stronger electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) occur on the 3L-TiO2 with the smaller band gap, resulting in the formation of more robust Ru-O bonds. The enhanced EMSIs render the Ru in the Ru1/3L-TiO2 system more positively charged than that in the Ru1/2L-TiO2 system. The projected density of states (DOS) for nL-TiO2, both before and after the binding of Ru1, was examined to investigate changes in the electronic structure. The conduction-band minimum (CBM) of 2L- and 3L-TiO2 is predominantly composed of Ti 3d states, while the valence-band maximum (VBM) is mainly derived from O 2p states, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. Upon Ru binding, the entire band structure of TiO2 was observed to be disturbed without evident band shifting with the vacuum energy (Evac) as energy zero, and the occupied Ru 4d orbitals were found to primarily reside within the band gap of TiO2, as depicted in Fig. 2e and f. This filling of the Ru 4d electrons into the band gap imparts a metallic characteristic to both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 systems. Notably, a portion of the occupied Ru 4d orbitals for the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 system is penetrated the valence band region, overlapping with the O 2p orbitals, which coincides with the formation of Ru-O2f bonds. It is noted that more Ru 4d electrons enter the valence band region of 3L-TiO2 than that of 2L-TiO2. This difference can likely be ascribed to the 3L-TiO2, which, with its smaller band gap, exhibits superior electronic mobility compared to the 2L-TiO2. The d-band centers (εd) of Ru in the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 systems are positioned at −0.95 eV and −1.43 eV, respectively, relative to the corresponding Fermi energy (Ef) level. The band gap of the TiO2 support effectively influences the position of the d-band center of the supported Ru1, modulating its electronic properties [23]. 3.2 Band gap effect of TiO2 on H2, CO and CO2 adsorption Reactants such as H2 and CO2, along with intermediates like CO, are typically involved for CO2 methanation catalyzed by Ru-based catalysts [24–26]. To elucidate the impact of the TiO2 band gap on the adsorption states of these reactants and intermediates, the adsorption of H2, CO and CO2 on Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 was examined. For H2 adsorption, it was observed that H2 spontaneously dissociates into two H atoms on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 surfaces, with dissociated adsorption energies of −1.35 eV and −0.88 eV, respectively. This suggests a stronger H adsorption affinity on the Ru1/2L-TiO2. For CO2 adsorption on the Ru1/3L-TiO2, both the Ru site and the bridged site between Ru and Ti5f were considered (Figure S2). CO2 was found to preferentially adsorb at the bridge between Ru and Ti5f (Figs. 3 c and 3d) on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2, with corresponding adsorption energies of −1.64 eV and −1.49 eV The adsorbed CO2 molecule is bent and activated, with its two CO bonds elongated compared to the 1.177 Å bond length in free CO2. CO was found to be favorably adsorbed in a linear configuration at the top site of Ru on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 (Fig. 3e and f), with adsorption energies of −2.22 eV and −1.61 eV, respectively. The newly formed C-Ru bond on the Ru1/2L-TiO2 is approximately 0.07 Å shorter than that on the Ru1/3L-TiO2. The Ru1/2L-TiO2, with its larger band gap, exhibits stronger adsorption of H2, CO2, and CO on the surface compared to the Ru1/3L-TiO2. This enhanced adsorption can be attributed to the closer proximity of the d-band center to the Fermi level, according to the d-band center theory [23]. Bader charge analyses reveal that the Ru in the Ru1/2L-TiO2 transfers 0.70, 0.77 and 0.77 electrons to the support and the adsorbates H2, CO2 and CO, respectively, whereas the Ru in the Ru1/3L-TiO2 transfers 0.96, 0.92 and 0.94 electrons in sequence. Moreover, more electrons are transferred from the Ru in the Ru1/3L-TiO2 to the support. The stronger EMSIs of the Ru1/3L-TiO2 result in a lower charge density at the Ru site, leading to weaker adsorption of reactants H2 and CO2, and intermediate CO on the Ru1/3L-TiO2. This could, in turn, influence elementary steps involved in the CO2 methanation reaction. 3.3 Band gap effect of TiO2 on initial conversion of CO2 To investigate the influence of the TiO2 band gap on the initial transformation of CO2, calculations were performed for the dissociation of CO2* to CO*, the C-end hydrogenation of CO2* to HCOO*, and the O-end hydrogenation of CO2* to COOH* on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 surfaces (Fig. 4 ). Among the three pathways, the direct dissociation of CO2* to CO* on the Ru1/2L-TiO2 surface displayed the lowest activation energy (Ea), with an Ea of 1.44 eV and an reaction energy change (ΔE) of 0.45 eV The CO bond of CO2 was elongated from 1.268 Å to 1.882 Å and then decomposed. The hydrogenation at the C-end of CO2 to form HCOO* was found to be more favorable than the O-end hydrogenation to COOH* in terms of both kinetics and thermodynamics, with a smaller Ea and ΔE. A similar trend was observed for the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface, albeit with varying degrees of reduction in the Ea and ΔE for the three pathways. Specifically, the direct dissociation of CO2* on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface showed an Ea of 1.37 eV and a ΔE of 0.12 eV The findings indicate that the band gap of the TiO2 support had a negligible impact on the initial conversion of CO2. This can be attributed to the minor differences in the adsorption energies of CO2 on the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 surfaces. 3.4 Band gap effect of TiO2 on CO hydrogenation The findings from the initial conversion of CO2 suggest that the CO pathway was most favorable on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 catalysts, aligning with our previous experimental study that have reported CO2 methanation following the CO pathway on Ru nanoparticles supported on rutile TiO2 [26]. To delve deeper into the impact of the TiO2 band gap on the hydrogenation of CO, a comprehensive analysis of all potential elementary steps for the conversion of CO to CH4 was conducted on the surfaces. The configurations and energies associated with these steps are detailed in Figures S4-S5 and Table S1. The most favorable pathway (Fig. 5 ) for the hydrogenation of CO to CH4 on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 was identified as follows: CO* → HCO* → H2CO* → H2COH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4*. Specifically, the conversion of CO* to H2CO* involves two successive C-end hydrogenation steps (reactions R2 and R3). Subsequently, H2CO* is transformed into H2COH* through an O-end hydrogenation step (reaction R4). The formation of H2C* from H2COH* (reaction R5) is followed by two further C-end hydrogenation steps, culminating in the formation of CH4* (reactions R6 and R7). The hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* (reaction R1) is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS). When combining these findings with the results from the dissociation of CO2 to CO*, it is evident that the same mechanism is followed for CO2 methanation on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 surfaces. On the Ru1/2L-TiO2 surface, the RDS involving the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* requires overcoming an Ea of 1.78 eV, with a ΔE of 0.86 eV In contrast, on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface, a lower Ea of 1.41 eV is needed to overcome for CO2 methanation, accompanied by a markedly reduced ΔE of 0.23 eV These results demonstrated that the band gap of the support material significantly influences the change of activation energy and reaction energy. The CO2 methanation process on the Ru1/3L-TiO2, which features a narrower band gap, is considerably more favorable from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. Table 1 3.5 Band gap effect of TiO2 on the mobility and promotion role of hydrogen during CO hydrogenation In the process of hydrogenating CO* to HCO* (Fig. 5 and Figure S4), the hydrogen atom migrates from the Ru site to the C end of CO*. The mobility of the hydrogen atom appears to be pivotal for the RDS of CO2 methanation. The adsorption of a hydrogen atom on the CO-adsorbed Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 was calculated. The calculated adsorption energy for a hydrogen atom on the CO-adsorbed Ru1/2L-TiO2 is −0.82 eV, whereas on the CO-adsorbed Ru1/3L-TiO2 it is −0.68 eV This suggests that the migration of a hydrogen atom to the C-end of CO* on the Ru1/2L-TiO2 surface is more challenging than on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface. Additionally, the bond length of the CO in CO is observed to be elongated when co-adsorbed with hydrogen on both the Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 surfaces, as compared to CO adsorption in isolation. This elongation suggests that the presence of a hydrogen atom enhances the activation of CO, highlighting the critical role of hydrogen in the reaction process. The adsorption energies of CO on the hydrogen-adsorbed Ru1/nL-TiO2 surfaces exceed those on the pristine surfaces, further confirming the promotional effect of hydrogen on CO adsorption. Moreover, this promotional effect is more pronounced on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface, which features a narrower band gap support, compared to the Ru1/2L-TiO2 surface. Consequently, CO* is more highly activated on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increased hydrogen mobility and the more significant promotional effect of hydrogen on CO adsorption, attributed to the support with a narrower band gap, are the driving forces behind the more facile hydrogenation of CO* on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 as opposed to the Ru1/2L-TiO2. Fig. 6 4 Conclusions In this work, we explored the impact of the band gap of an oxide support on the structural and reactivity of a single Ru atom by DFT calculations, using Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 as model catalysts for the CO2 methanation reaction. These supports featured band gaps of 2.39 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively. We discovered that the band gap significantly influences the EMSIs and the position of the d-band center of the supported Ru1 atom. Specifically, the Ru1/3L-TiO2, whose support has narrower band gap, displayed stronger EMSIs and a d-band center of the Ru1 farther from the Fermi level compared to the Ru1/2L-TiO2. This resulted in a reduced charge density on the Ru1 and diminished adsorption strength for H2 and CO2, and CO on the Ru1/3L-TiO2. The CO2 methanation reaction adheres to the CO pathway, with the sequential transformation of intermediates as follows: CO2* → CO* → HCO* → H2CO* → H2COH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4*. Within this sequence, the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* is identified as the rate-determining step. The methanation process occurring on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 realized a lower activation energy and was accompanied by a significantly reduced endothermic heat, in contrast to the reactions on the Ru1/2L-TiO2. These findings indicate that the Ru1 catalyst supported on the TiO2 with a narrower band gap is substantially more advantageous from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives for CO2 methanation, even though the band gap does not modify the reaction pathway itself. The improved hydrogen mobility and the pronounced enhancement of hydrogen's promotional effect on CO adsorption, which can be attributed to the support with a narrower band gap, are identified as the pivotal factors to propel the more facile hydrogenation of CO* on the Ru1/3L-TiO2 compared to the Ru1/2L-TiO2. The findings underscore the critical role of the support's band gap in modulating the electronic structure of supported metal single atom catalysts and dictating the catalytic activity for CO2 methanation and provide deeper insights into the fundamental principles governing the interactions between metal and support.

        "dc:description": "The influence of TiO2 band gap on structure and reactivity of the supported single ruthenium (Ru1) atom was studied by density functional theory calculations, utilizing Ru1/2L-TiO2 and Ru1/3L-TiO2 as model catalysts for CO2 methanation. The supports have band gaps of 2.39 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively. The band gap plays a significant role in electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) and the position of the d-band center of the Ru1 on the TiO2. The Ru1/3L-TiO2, the Ru1 catalyst supported on the 3L-TiO2 with a narrower band gap, shows enhanced EMSIs and a d-band center that is positioned farther from Fermi level, leading to lower charge density on the Ru1 and weaker adsorption of H2, CO2, and CO compared to the Ru1/2L-TiO2. CO2 methanation followed CO pathway, with the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* identified as the rate-determining step on the Ru1/nL-TiO2. The Ru1 catalyst supported on TiO2 with a narrower band gap is more favorable kinetically and thermodynamically for CO2 methanation, despite the band gap not altering the reaction pathway. Enhanced hydrogen mobility and a pronounced promotional effect of hydrogen on CO adsorption, due to the narrower band gap support, are key factors facilitating the easier hydrogenation of CO* on the Ru1/3L-TiO2.",
