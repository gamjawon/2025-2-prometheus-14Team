In DEG amination, catalytic activity was proportional to the dispersion of metallic nickel only, while in DEGA amination catalytic activity depended on the acidity of the catalysts. Key words: amination; morpholine; nickel; reduction; supported catalyst 1. Introduction Morpholine is often used as a component of vulcanization accelerators, emulsifiers, pesticides or pharmaceutical products, and therefore, an optimal procedure for its production is very important. Morpholine can be produced [ 1 ] by the dehydration of diethanolamine by treatment with a strong acid, such as oleum, concentrated sulfuric acid or concentrated hydrochloric acid. A second method for the production of morpholine involves the reaction of diethylene glycol with ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst at a temperature between 150 and 400 C and a pressure between 3 and 40 MYa. In the presence of specially tailored nickel catalysts [2,3] reaction of diethylene glycol with ammonia proceeds even under relatively mild conditions (190 C, 0.1 MPa). From a macroscopic point of view, the formation of morpholine (M) from diethylene *Corresponding author. Fax (+42-2) 342073, e-mail ICECAS@CSEARN.BITNET 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is evident that the selectivity of the catalyst used must play a decisive role in limiting the amounts of the byproducts produced. Many catalytic systems were proposed for the selective formation of morpholine from diethylene glycol and ammonia. Alumina [ 5-7 ] in its y or a form, titania [ 8,9] or chromia [ 10] were recommended as the best catalyst supports and nickel as the best active com- O. Solcovd, R. Jirdtovd / Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994)193-204 195 ponent. The highest activity and selectivity was observed with the catalysts containing 3060 wt.% of nickel. The aim of the work was to elucidate the role of the support of the nickel catalyst in the reductive amination of DEG, since both metallic character and acid-base properties of the catalyst can affect the course of the morpholine formation from diethylene glycol and ammonia. 2. Experimental Nickel catalysts in their oxidic form (50 to 79 wt.% Ni0) were prepared by mixing the alumina (Condea Chemie, FRG), silica (Tonaso NeWmice, Czech Republic), zirconia, titania, niobia, vanadia or zinc oxide (all Lachema Brno, Czech Republic) purum) in the form of a fine powder with a solution of basic nickel carbonate in aqueous ammonia. The same nickel solution was used for the preparation of unsupported nickel oxide. All the supported nickel catalysts and the unsupported catalyst were dried at 120 C and calcined at 370 C for 3 h. The powders of calcined catalysts were pelleted, crushed and screened to the size of 0.16-0.32 mm. Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced in situ by hydrogen at 270 C for 2 h (unless indicated otherwise). The activity of the catalysts in the reaction of diethylene glycol or diethylene glycol amine with ammonia was measured in an integral flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed of 0.5 g catalyst. The molar ratio of DEG : NH3 : HZ was 1:10: 5, reaction temperature 190 C. The liquid condensate at 0 C was analysed by GC on a glass column of 2 m length and 3 mm i.d. (packed with Supelcoport covered by 4% of Carbowax 20 M with 0.8 wt.% of KOH). Nitrogen as carrier gas, FID detector and temperature program ranging from 65 up to 200 C were applied during the analysis. The results are expressed in terms of the peak area percentage of the main compounds in the liquid reaction product. The rate constants of diethylene glycol kDEG and diethylene glycol amine kDEGA transformation were determined from Eq. 5 for pseudo-first order reaction k WIF= =ln(1-x) (5) (W= the catalyst weight/g; F= feed rate of DEG or DEGA mol h-', x=peak area fraction of the initial reaction components (DEG or DEGA) present in the liquid reaction product). Calculated rate constants, k, were used for comparison of the activity of the catalysts. The selectivity of the catalyst, S;, was determined as S;=100 x;/(1-xj) (6) where x; is the peak area fraction of the products and xj the peak area fraction of reactants in the liquid reaction product (i = morpholine, splitting or consecutive products and j = DEG or DEGA). Porosimetric measurements were performed with the use of a computer-controlled automatic porosimeter, AutoPore 9200 (Micromeritics, USA) working up to 400 MPa. Helium densities were measured in a helium pycnometer, AutoPycnometer 1320 (Micrqmeritics, USA). Catalyst surface areas were determined from the physical adsorption of nitrogen at 196 O.

The acidity of the catalysts (total amount of acidic sites) were determined from the measurements of TPD of adsorbed ammonia up to 400 C. Details were given earlier [ 11 ] . Chemisorption of oxygen was measured by the dynamic pulse method. The procedure was described in detail elsewhere [ 12]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Physical properties Physical properties of the supports and catalysts (surface area, apparent and real density, porosity and the amount of nickel) are summarized in Table 1. Considerable differences in the BET surface areas of the supports and the catalysts were found: The BET surface areas of the catalysts varied in the range 46 to 199 m2 g-', while the BET surface areas of the supports varied in a substantially broader range - from 1 to 269 m2 g'. The findings are understandable when possible mechanism of solid phase formation (taking into account the preparation method used) is considered: 1. In case of the support with high BET surface area, small pores of the supports are blocked Table 1 Physical properties' of the pulverized supports and the grains of the catalysts Sample Ni S PHg pH. p _b Porosity wt.% Ni 100 89 2.76 6.04 6.67 0.54 Ni-Si02 57 199 0.81 2.65 0.69 Ni-SiO2, 38 142 1.11 3.19 0.65 Ni-Si02 24 179 1.95 3.97 0.51 Si02 94 0.28 2.17 2.17` 0.87 Ni-A1203 52 123 2.12 4.56 0.54 y-A1203 269 1.13 2.68 3.42 0.58 N'-V205 57 121 2.06 4.45 0.54 V205 8 1.57 3.31 3.36 0.52 Ni-Zn0 52 88 1.9 5.59 0.66 Zn0 2 1.09 5.4 5.66 0.80 Ni-Ti02 54 64 2.08 5.31 0.61 T'02 1 1.61 4.2 4.26 0.62 Ni-Zr02 58 58 1.11 5.61 0.8 Zr02 18 0.75 5.36 5.73 0.86 Ni-Nb205 52 46 1.39 4.73 0.71 1'o205 6 2.57 4.57 4.86 0.44 'S =surface area/M2 g-1; p.g=apparent density/ g cm-j; pH, =true density/g cm-3; pe,~,=crystal density/g cm-3; porosity =1-pHB pH~- '.

Jirdtovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994)193-2O 197 with the particles of solid nickel compound formed after drying the impregnation solution. Simultaneously, small particles of the supports could be placed on the surface of nickel phase formed. Therefore, both support and nickel can participate in the resulting catalyst BET surface area. In this way, the surface area of the catalyst prepared can decrease and the dispersion of nickel phase increases (the most pronounced effect was observed with the Ni/A1203 system). 2. When the support with low BET surface area is used for the catalyst preparation, the large pores of such supports are filled with solid nickel phase which has its own porous structure changing with alteration of the preparation conditions. As a result, an increase of the BET surface area can be observed. Also in this case, both support and nickel phase take part in the formation of the resulting BET surface area. The fact that both nickel phase and the support contribute to the formation of the porous structure of the catalyst is documented by pore size distribution curves. An example of the pore size distribution curves of the Si02 support and the corresponding catalysts containing different amount of nickel is shown in Fig. 1.

Jirdtovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994)193-2O nm) the distribution curves of the catalysts copy the distribution curve of the support. In the range of the small pore sizes (from 2 to 30 nm) there is a great difference between the pore size distribution curves of the support and the catalysts. It is evident that small pores are present in the pore size distribution curves of nickel oxide and the supported catalysts, whereas they are absent in the curves of the support. Small pores of the nickel oxide phase consequently contribute to an increase of the total surface area of the catalysts. This fact confirms the idea that both support and nickel oxide phase participate in the formation of porous structure and surface area of high-loaded nickel catalyst. In Table 1 there are the values of theoretical densities Aheor [ 13] of the metal oxides together with the skeletal densities Ne and particle densities Ng of the oxides and the supported nickel catalysts. The comparison of theoretical and skeletal densities shows that the values are very similar for Ti02(rutile) and V205. For other oxides, the differences in both densities reach values of 5 to 27% rel, which indicates a non-perfect crystalline state of the oxides used. 3.2. Catalytic activity In the transformation of DEG, catalytic activities of the catalysts expressed as rate constants of DEG depletion are found in the range (0.6 to 8.8) X 10-3 mol h-' gcat` (Table 2). While the catalysts on silica were the most active, the Ni-Zr02, Ni-Nb205, Ni-Zn0 and unsupported Ni were the least active. It was found that the rate constants kDEG are proportional to the catalyst BET surface area (Fig. 2). Similar linear correlation was observed between the rate constants of DEG transformation and the data of oxygen chemisorption [ 12] (Fig. 3) . The findings are not very surprising as a decrease of nickel particle size (and consequently an increase of oxygen chemisorbed) can be expected with increasing surface area of the catalyst and vice versa. No dependence of DEG transformation on the catalyst acidity was found.

Catalysts are denoted as in Fig. 2. In the transformation of DEGA, the activities of the catalysts moved in the range (2 to 15) X 10-3 mol h-1 gQt (Table 2). Also in this reaction, the activity of the Ni-Si02 catalyst was the highest and the activities of the Ni-ZnO and the unsupported Ni were the lowest. No dependence of the activity of the catalysts on the catalyst or nickel surface area was observed. Therefore, some other factors had to play a role in the reaction. As elimination of water or ammonia from diethylene glycol amine leading to a formation of six-membered cycle might be an acid-base mechanism, acidity of the catalysts can be important. In Fig. 4, a relation between the rate constants of DEGA transformation and the amount of chemisorbed ammonia characterising the acidity of the catalysts is shown. The dependence of the rate constants for DEGA transformation passed through a maximum which was located 200 O. golcova, K.

Catalysts are denoted as in Fig. 2. near the acidity, 0.8 atoms of NH3 per 1 nm2 of catalyst surface area. Fig. 4 proves that an optimal catalyst acidity is necessary for achievement of maximum conversion of diethylene glycol amine. This \"volcano\" shape of the curve is not easily explained. Low conversion of diethylene glycol amine at low concentration of acidic sites is natural and understandable. An explanation of the decrease of catalytic activity with higher concentration of acidic sites than the optimal value is more complicated. It can be supposed that a considerable part of the acidic sites cannot be exploited for catalytic reaction, either because of an unsuitable geometric arrangement at higher density of sites, or because of an increased amount of sites with insufficient acidic strength. Therefore, the activity related to the total surface concentration of acidic sites must decrease. For all our catalysts examined, the rate constants, kDEGA, were significantly higher than the rate constants, kDEG (Table 2). This means that dehydrogenation of DEG and/or consequent amination to DEGA is slower than cyclization of DEGA to morpholine which, therefore, affects the overall transformation of DEG to morpholine less significantly. However, the difference is not so high (ratio is < 10) in order to consider transformation of DEG as a rate-determining step. In contrast to that, Cooper and his coworkers [ 14] report that the hydrogenation step, i.e. the formation of an aldehyde or aldimine from a primary alcohol or amine, is the rate-determining. 3.3. Selectivity of the catalysts With some supported nickel catalysts, many products of splitting and consecutive reactions were detected during the transformation of DEG to morpholine. Their amounts were given by the selectivities of the catalysts for the morpholine formation. The selectivities to the individual products (morpholine, DEGA, splitting and consecutive products) observed at concentrations 30% of the starting DEG in the liquid reaction mixture are given in Fig. 5. The best selectivity to morpholine (70-80%) was observed with the catalysts in which O. golcovd, K Jiratovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994)193-2O 201 silica or alumina were used as catalyst supports. In the presence of these catalysts, the amounts of splitting and consecutive products were very low. Somewhat lower selectivity to morpholine (50-69%) was showed by the Ni-Ti02 and Ni-V205 catalysts. The formation of consecutive products was preferred in the presence of the Ni-V205 catalyst, whereas on the Ni-Ti02 catalyst both splitting and consecutive products were found. The lowest selectivity to morpholine (about 30%) was obtained for the Ni-M20.5, Ni-Zr02, Ni-ZnO and the unsupported Ni catalysts. The last two catalysts promoted the formation of undesirable splitting and consecutive products to a large extent.

Solcovd, K Jirdtovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994)193-2O mediate (DEGA) in the liquid reaction product was low in the presence of all catalysts tested, with exception of Ni-V205 catalyst. The selectivities to the individual reaction products, when DEGA was used as a starting reactant in reductive amination, observed in the presence of our supported nickel catalysts, are given in Fig. 6. It is remarkable that no splitting products were found in the liquid products with all catalysts. Very likely, the presence of some amount of DEG in the reaction mixture is necessary for their formation. In terms of the selectivity to morpholine, the best value (85%) was observed with the Ni-Si02 catalyst. With nickel supported on alumina, vanadia and titania, respectively, approximately identical selectivities to morpholine were found (ca. 70%) . In the case of the remaining nickel catalysts (Ni-Zr02, Ni, Ni-Nb205 and Ni-Zn0), the selectivities to morpholine gradually decreased to ca. 45%. Comparison of Figs. 5 and 6 shows that differences in the morpholine concentration in liquid products of the DEGA transformation are lower than those observed in the case of the DEG transformation. 4. Conclusion The strong effect of support on the activity and selectivity of nickel catalysts (with high nickel content; ca. 55%) for reductive amination of DEG and DEGA was confirmed. In the reductive amination of DEG, the catalytic activity was proportional to the BET surface areas of supported nickel catalysts only. In the reductive amination of DEGA, the catalytic activity was non-linearly dependent on the acidity of the catalysts. The first step of the overall DEG transformation which includes in general the dehydrogenation and amination step, is kinetically the more important step than cyclization of DEGA to morpholine, which is faster and thus, its effect on the overall reaction rate is less significant. 5.

In DEG amination, catalytic activity was proportional to the dispersion of metallic nickel only, while in DEGA amination catalytic activity depended on the acidity of the catalysts.
