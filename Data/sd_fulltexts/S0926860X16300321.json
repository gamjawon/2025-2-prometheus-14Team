Graphical abstract MgO-coated Ni catalysts with two different shell thicknesses were prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and their catalytic activities for the CO2 reforming of CH4 (CRM) were compared with that of bare Ni catalyst. Conversion of CO2 and CH4 in the CRM reaction at 800°C was enhanced with increasing thickness of the ALD-deposited MgO shells. In particular, the catalytic activity of MgO/Ni catalyst prepared using 200 ALD MgO deposition cycles was fairly durable, with negligible deactivation during a 72h CRM reaction. We suggest that the MgO shell, which is highly basic and has high affinity to CO2, likely, accelerated the reverse CO disproportionation, thereby reducing the poisoning of Ni active sites during the CRM reaction. Furthermore, the 200-cycled MgO shell destroyed ensemble of Ni catalysts surface, allowing preservation of Ni active sites with preferential growth of filamentous carbon to layered graphitic ones. We suggest that the preparation of core–shell structures using ALD can be a promising strategy for fabricating highly active and durable catalysts that are operable at relatively high temperatures. Keywords Atomic layer deposition (ALD) CO2 reforming of CH4 (CRM) Ni catalyst MgO 1 Introduction In recent decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) has been regarded as a chief cause of climate change, owing to its high emissions from the excessive use of fossil fuels. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been increasing consistently and now surpasses 400ppm. Accordingly, various strategies to reduce CO2 have been studied by many researchers. Much previous research on the reduction of CO2 emissions has focused on the storage of CO2 in liquid or solid media; however, more recently, much attention has also been paid to the chemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals [1–4]. Carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CRM; CH4 +CO2 =2CO+2H2, Δ H 298 K 0 =247kJ/mol) can be regarded as a first step of the process of converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, because once syngas molecules such as CO and H2 are produced, they can be relatively easily converted into other valuable chemicals by means of diverse reactions using already commercialized catalysts; candidates include the Fischer–Tropsch process, methanol synthesis, and oxo synthesis [5–11]. It is also worth noting that CRM consumes CH4, which is another well-known greenhouse gas. Because the CRM reaction is endothermic, it requires a high reaction temperature typically above 800°C, even if an active catalyst is used; in this situation, it is important that the catalyst not only be highly active, but also highly durable. Noble metal catalysts such as Rh, Ru, Pd, and Pt have been widely considered as catalysts for the CRM reaction because of their highly stable catalytic activity for the CRM reaction as well as their high conversion of CO2 and CH4 [12–16]. Nevertheless, the utilization of noble metal catalysts can be economically prohibitive due to their expense and limited availability. To replace these noble metal catalysts, Ni-based catalysts have been investigated as attractive candidates on account of their relatively low cost, abundance, and high catalytic activity for the CRM reaction [17–20]. However, deactivation of Ni catalysts under very high operating temperatures has remained a major drawback; this is attributed to sintering as well as surface formation of a carbon layer (coke). Consequently, a great deal of effort has been devoted to enhancing Ni catalysts’ performance, not only with respect to their initial catalytic activity but also their long-term stability in the CRM reaction. It has been demonstrated that the acidic or basic properties of the Ni catalyst surface can significantly affect its catalytic performance; introduction of basic sites in Ni catalysts by doping, alloying, or the use of basic supporting materials can increase catalytic conversion and durability by favoring the adsorption of CO2 on the basic sites, thereby inhibiting the deposition of coke [21–26]. In the present work, enhancement of the catalytic activity and stability of Ni-based catalysts for the CRM reaction was attempted by using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to prepare the catalysts. Recently, ALD has been in the limelight as a superior method for catalyst design, owing to its ability to form thin films with high uniformity, conformity, reproducibility, and thickness accuracy at the atomic level [27–29]. We deposited MgO, which is a strongly basic material, onto commercially available Ni catalysts by using ALD and studied the effect of the MgO shell upon the catalytic performance of Ni for the CRM reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of MgO/Ni catalysts via atomic layer deposition (ALD) An ALD process was used to deposit MgO onto Ni particles (particle size <1μm, Sigma–Aldrich). Ni particles of 1.0g were contained in a custom-made sample holder for powder, which was then placed in the center of a stainless steel chamber at 200°C. Bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)magnesium (Mg(CpEt)2, EG Chem Co., Ltd.) and O2 were respectively used as the precursor and oxidizing agent for MgO deposition. Vaporized Mg(CpEt)2 precursor at 80°C and at the working pressure of 200mTorr was injected into the chamber for 20s and then exposed to the surface of the Ni particles for 40s. Subsequently, O2 at the working pressure of 1.2Torr was injected into the chamber for 3s and exposed to the precursor-treated Ni particles for 50s. Evacuation and purging with N2 gas (99.999%) were carried out repeatedly between injections of each reactant to inhibit gas-phase reactions of the precursor with the oxidizing agent. The conditions noted above constitute one ALD cycle for the MgO deposition. In this work, MgO/Ni catalysts were prepared for the CRM reaction by applying 50 and 200 ALD cycles; hereafter, these MgO/Ni catalysts are respectively denoted as 50MgO/Ni and 200MgO/Ni. 2.2 Characterization of catalysts The surface composition and chemical state of MgO/Ni catalysts were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS analyses were carried out under ultrahigh vacuum conditions with the base pressure of 5×10−10 Torr. XPS spectra were collected using a concentric hemispherical analyzer (CHA, PHOIBOS-HSA3500, SPECS) with a pass energy of 10eV and Mg Kα X-ray source with a photon energy of 1253.6eV. A morphological image of each catalyst was obtained by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL). N2 adsorption isotherms of bare Ni and the 50MgO/Ni and 200MgO/Ni catalysts were carried out (ASAP2010, Micromeritics) to enable calculations of catalyst surface area and pore volume by means of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH), respectively. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was used to evaluate the basicity of the catalysts by using a gas chromatograph (GC; HP6890, Hewlett-Packard), which was equipped with a fused silica capillary column (Carboxen 1010 PLOT, 30m×0.32mm, Supelco) and dual detectors (thermal conductivity detector, TCD; flame ionization detector, FID). A 50mg sample of each catalyst was wrapped in quartz wool and placed in the center of a horizontal quartz tube reactor (31mm in internal diameter and 530mm in height). Each catalyst was saturated with CO2 molecules at room temperature for 6h, followed by purging with N2 for 2.5h and subsequent heating under N2 flow from 30 to 800°C with the constant heating rate of 5°C/min. To characterize the surface carbon species after the CRM reaction, CO2 temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles of the used catalysts were acquired; these profiles were governed by the reverse CO disproportionation reaction (C+CO2 →2CO). CO2 was flowed over the used catalysts with increase of temperature 30 to 800°C in conjunction with the constant heating rate of 1°C/min. Details about the calculations of CO2 desorption and CO evolution rates were described in Supplementary material, S1. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the used catalysts over the scanning range from 20 to 80° were obtained using a X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source (λ =1.5418Å). 2.3 CRM reaction over MgO/Ni catalysts The CRM reaction was carried out over each catalyst in a vertically fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. In each test reaction, a 100mg sample of catalyst was wrapped in quartz wool and placed in the center of a quartz tube, in the same manner used to carry out the CO2 TPD. A reagent gas mixture with the CH4/CO2 ratio of 1 was injected with the total flow rate of 20ml/min. Under this flow, the reactor was heated from 30 to 800°C with the heating rate of 1°C/min and then held at 800°C for 4h to stabilize the system. To monitor the CRM reaction, the catalyst was held at 800°C and the gas flow was continued for 72h while the fractions of CRM reactants and products were measured using a GC. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the as-prepared MgO/Ni catalysts The surfaces of bare and MgO-deposited Ni catalysts were characterized by XPS (Fig. 1 ). In the Ni 2p3/2 spectra of bare Ni catalysts, peaks were observed centered at 855.4eV with shoulders at 852.1eV; these were respectively assigned to Ni(OH)2 and metallic Ni [30]. This result indicated the presence of an intrinsic hydroxide layer in the surface regime of the bare Ni particles. For 50MgO/Ni catalysts, the intensity of the Ni peak in the hydroxide state was significantly decreased with respect to that of the bare catalyst and the metallic Ni peak almost vanished; on the other hand, a peak assigned to the nickel oxide species was observed, centered at 853.8eV [30]. During the initial stage of MgO deposition, NiOH species on the surface of Ni particles can be converted into NiOMg in the interface as a consequence of reaction between the Mg precursor molecules and the hydroxyl species of the Ni surface. Also, the Ni 2p3/2 peak was drastically decreased in the spectrum of the 200MgO/Ni catalyst compared to that of the 50MgO/Ni catalyst; contrastingly, the new Mg 2p peak centered at 50.7eV was more pronounced for the 200MgO/Ni sample. The chemical shift of this peak corresponds to the Mg(II) species (MgO). To study the morphology of the Ni catalysts before and after 200 deposition cycles to form the MgO shell, SEM analysis was carried out (Fig. 2 ). The mean diameter of the Ni particles before MgO deposition was approximately 700nm, and after 200 cycles of MgO deposition, Ni particles were almost completely wrapped by a MgO shell with a mean thickness of approximately 20nm (Fig. 2a). Thus, one can deduce that each ALD cycle deposited approximately 1Å of MgO film, i.e., several ALD cycles are required for completing one monolayer of MgO. A magnified view of the Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 1a inset) revealed that the Ni peak did not fully disappear in the 200MgO/Ni sample, even if the MgO layer was much thicker than the monitoring depth of the XPS analysis; note that XPS is only sensitive to the first 5–10nm of depth from the surface outermost layer. This suggests that the MgO film included some cracks, allowing detection of photoelectrons emitted from the Ni core. Table 1 compares the surface areas and pore volumes of the samples before and after MgO ALD, which were determined by the BET and the BJH methods, respectively. Both the surface area and the pore volume decreased slightly from 3.9m2/gcat and 0.0055cm3/gcat to 3.5m2/gcat and 0.0043cm3/gcat after 50 cycles of MgO deposition. On the other hand, 200MgO/Ni sample showed a pronounced increment in the pore volume compared with the other samples, albeit with decreased surface area. The gradual decrease of surface area of Ni with the increase of MgO loading seems to be related to the surface roughness of the bare Ni surface. As shown in Fig. 2, the rough surface structure of Ni nanoparticles was smoothened with MgO deposition, resulting in the decrease of BET surface area. Taking both XPS and pore volume analyses into account, one can suggest that the MgO shell was not densely packed, and contained some cracks and defect sites. In heterogeneous catalysis, it is crucial that reactant molecules chemisorb onto the active sites of the catalyst surface, and facile desorption of product molecules from the surface of catalytically active sites is also important. An MgO shell with a compact structure could completely block the Ni sites that are catalytically active for the CRM reaction, thereby quenching the catalytic activity. The porosity of the MgO shell may play an important role in the CRM reaction because the MgO pores can act as an interfacial diffusion channel of reactant and product molecules between the gas phase and the Ni active sites. In order to evaluate the basicity of each sample, CO2-TPD profiles of various catalysts with different MgO loadings were acquired (Fig. 3 ). The desorption temperature and the amount of desorbed CO2 can be respectively associated with a catalyst’s basicity and the number of basic sites on its surface. In the CO2-TPD profiles, three distinct CO2 desorption peaks were observed in the temperature ranges of 170–270, 300–450 and 450–700°C, which can be respectively attributed to the weak, moderate, and strong basic surface sites. In previous studies, the weak and strong basic sites were respectively attributed to surface hydroxyl groups and two types of undercoordinated O− sites, whereas the moderate basic sites were ascribed to either metallic Ni or Mg2+–O2− pairs [26,31]. As shown in Fig. 3, with increasing numbers of ALD MgO deposition cycles, the temperature of maximum CO2 desorption was generally shifted toward higher temperatures, indicating that the proportion of stronger basic sites on the surface increased gradually with increasing MgO deposition. In addition, the CO2-TPD spectra of the bare and MgO-coated Ni catalysts were de-convoluted with the suggested five different surface basic species for the quantitative determination of contribution of each species to CO2 adsorption/desorption (Supplementary materials, S2 and S3). For bare Ni, two different peaks were dominantly observed in the weak and moderate basic sites, which were attributed to CO2 desorption from the surface hydroxyl group and metallic Ni, respectively [32], and the total amount of the desorbed CO2 was 8.2μmol/gcat. Whereas, after the MgO deposition on Ni surface, CO2 desorption was mainly occurred on Mg2+–O2− pairs and undercoordiated O− sites with desorbed CO2 amounts of 6.5 and 12μmol/gcat for 50 and 200MgO/Ni, respectively. Although the total amount of CO2 adsorption sites on the 50MgO/Ni was a little bit smaller than that of the bare Ni, partly due to the lowered surface area upon MgO deposition with 50 cycles, almost same amounts of the moderate and strong basic sites were existed on the bare and 50-cycled Ni surfaces. In a previous study about CO2 adsorption/desorption on Ni (111), it was suggested that the binding state of one CO2 molecule with two Ni atoms is the most stable structure on Ni (111) surface [33]. Thus, based on the assumption that metallic Ni is active sites for the CRM reaction, one can approximately calculate the number of active sites available for the CRM reaction on the basis of the CO2 amounts, which were desorbed from metallic Ni sites (Supplementary material, S3). It was determined that there were 1.04, 0.08, and 0.06μmol/gcat of active Ni atoms on the bare Ni, 50 and 200MgO/Ni catalysts, respectively. 3.2 Catalytic performance for CRM reaction The CO2 and CH4 conversions of Ni catalysts without and with MgO layers during the CRM reaction at 800°C for 72h were plotted as a function of time on stream (Fig. 4 a, b). For bare Ni catalysts, CH4 conversion of 52.2% and CO2 conversion of 60.5% were observed at the beginning of the CRM reaction at 800°C, and the catalytic activity decreased gradually during the 72h test. The initial catalytic activity of the 50MgO/Ni catalysts was greater than that of bare Ni catalysts, but still decreased as the CRM reaction progressed. Contrastingly, the catalytic activity of the 200MgO/Ni catalysts was vastly greater than those of both the 50MgO/Ni and bare Ni catalysts, and remained almost unchanged throughout the 72h test, despite the relatively small amount of active Ni atoms. Compared with the recent work of Gould et al. which showed a positive effect of porous Al2O3 shell to the catalytic performance of Ni catalyst for the CRM reaction [34], we introduced not only porous shell, but also basicity on Ni catalyst using MgO deposition, which is hypothesized to be responsible for the enhancement in catalytic performance of Ni (Fig. 3). The increased basicity of the catalyst upon MgO deposition can promote chemisorption and activation of ‘acidic’ CO2 molecules, thereby leading to greater conversion of CO2 and CH4 and greater durability. It is noteworthy that the CO2 conversion was greater than the CH4 conversion and the H2/CO ratio was less than unity for all catalysts. Theoretically, the stoichiometry for the consumption of CO2 and CH4 in the CRM reaction should be 1:1, and the H2/CO ratio should be unity; however, CO2 and H2 molecules were additionally consumed and CO molecules were produced in our experiments due to the reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O), which is well known as a competitive side reaction of CRM. For bare Ni catalysts, the H2/CO ratio was 0.87 during the initial stage of the CRM reaction and declined to 0.71 after 72h of the reaction. The initial H2/CO ratio (0.89) of the CRM reaction over the 50MgO/Ni catalyst was slightly higher than that of bare Ni catalyst, and decreased more slowly than that of the bare Ni catalyst. The 200MgO/Ni catalysts showed the highest H2/CO ratio of any catalyst throughout the reaction time, as well as the slowest decrease in this ratio. In summary, the deposition of an MgO shell on the Ni catalyst improved its selectivity for the CRM reaction by suppressing the reverse water gas shift reaction. 3.3 Analysis of used catalysts: resistance to graphitic carbon formation In studies of the CRM reaction, a key issue has been how to suppress coke formation during the reaction, which deactivates the catalysts. For shedding light on the origin of the enhanced durability of the Ni catalysts by addition of the MgO shell, TPO by CO2, XRD analyses, and SEM analyses of the used catalysts were performed. CO2-TPO profiles of the used catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 . During CO2-TPO, CO production is governed by the reverse CO disproportionation reaction and the amount of carbon accumulated on each catalyst after 72h of the CRM reaction can be calculated using the following equation. (1) N a c c u m u l a t e d c a r b o n = ∫ 0 ∞ v C O d t 2 × 1 g c a t The carbon species accumulated on the used catalysts of bare Ni, 50MgO/Ni, and 200MgO/Ni were determined to be 0.103, 0.1015, and 0.085mol/gcat, respectively, indicating that increased MgO loading on Ni surfaces slightly decreased the accumulation of carbon. Moreover, regarding the reaction kinetics, the maximum of the CO evolution rate in TPO curve shifted from 650 to 595°C as the number of MgO ALD cycles applied was increased from 0 to 200, indicating that MgO facilitates the formation of CO during CO2-TPO. The CRM reaction comprises two sequential reactions: CH4 molecules dissociate into H2 molecules and carbonaceous residue on the catalyst, and then the deposited carbon reacts with CO2 molecules to produce CO molecules [35–37]. Also, the formation of carbon can be accelerated by acidity of the catalyst surface, and the modification of the catalyst surface by basic alkaline earth metal can promote the conversion of the carbon species to CO molecules because enhanced basicity of the catalyst surface facilitates chemisorption and activation of CO2 molecules [23]. Although the direct demonstration about the relationship between MgO basicity and CO2 affinity is still needed, one can hypothesize that the durability of the 200MgO/Ni catalysts and their lack of any significant deactivation for the CRM reaction is due to the critical role of MgO, which expedited the elimination of the deposited carbon species by enhancing the catalyst’s affinity toward CO2 and thereby lowering the activation energy of the reverse CO disproportionation reaction. Though, the 200MgO/Ni still showed a large amount of accumulated carbon, which is only ∼20% lower than on bare Ni, and therefore, the origin of the much lowered deactivation of Ni catalysts by MgO shell cannot be fully justified by only taking less accumulation of carbon in the presence of MgO shell into account. XRD and SEM results for the used catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . XRD analyses of the three catalysts yielded identical peaks centered at 2θ values of 44.5, 51.8 and 76.3°, which respectively correspond to the [111], [200], and [220] phases of the metallic Ni species. The intensity of an additional peak at 26.5° assigned to graphitic carbon was less pronounced for the 200MgO/Ni catalyst relative to the bare Ni and 50MgO/Ni catalysts, in agreement with the CO2-TPO result. SEM analysis of used bare Ni and 50MgO/Ni catalysts showed no difference in morphology; both had an encapsulating layer of carbon. Contrastingly, growth of filamentous carbon species occurred on the 200MgO/Ni catalysts (Fig. 6d). In general, Ni catalysts are deactivated by 2-D structured graphitic carbon deposition on the surface of catalysts during the CRM reaction. Accordingly, destruction of Ni ensemble against carbon deposition has been regarded as a key strategy for the enhancement of the catalytic durability of Ni catalysts [19]. Here, it is noteworthy that MgO shell on Ni surfaces destroyed Ni ensemble, resulting in formation of the 3-D structured carbon filaments, which are much less able to obstruct the active Ni sites for the CRM reaction than 2-D layered carbon species. This observation suggests that not only the amount of carbon accumulated but also the structure of carbon deposited on Ni surfaces is crucial in the catalytic durability of Ni catalysts for the CRM reaction. 4 Conclusions MgO-deposited Ni catalysts were prepared using ALD and their catalytic behaviors for the CRM reaction at 800°C were studied. The MgO/Ni catalysts showed enhanced catalytic conversions of CO2 and CH4 relative to bare Ni catalyst; in particular, there was almost no deactivation of the 200MgO/Ni catalyst during a 72h CRM reaction. The durability of 200MgO/Ni catalyst was ascribed to the unique property of MgO in facilitating the formation of filamentous carbon rather than a layered structure, as well as its high basicity, which decreased carbon deposition by promoting the reverse CO disproportionation reaction. We conclude that the preparation of core–shell structures using ALD is a promising strategy for fabricating highly active and durable catalysts that are operable at relatively high temperatures.

        "dc:description": "MgO-coated Ni catalysts with two different shell thicknesses were prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and their catalytic activities for the CO2 reforming of CH4 (CRM) were compared with that of bare Ni catalyst. Conversion of CO2 and CH4 in the CRM reaction at 800°C was enhanced with increasing thickness of the ALD-deposited MgO shells. In particular, the catalytic activity of MgO/Ni catalyst prepared using 200 ALD MgO deposition cycles was fairly durable, with negligible deactivation during a 72h CRM reaction. We suggest that the MgO shell, which is highly basic and has high affinity to CO2, likely, accelerated the reverse CO disproportionation, thereby reducing the poisoning of Ni active sites during the CRM reaction. Furthermore, the 200-cycled MgO shell destroyed ensemble of Ni catalysts surface, allowing preservation of Ni active sites with preferential growth of filamentous carbon to layered graphitic ones. We suggest that the preparation of core–shell structures using ALD can be a promising strategy for fabricating highly active and durable catalysts that are operable at relatively high temperatures.",
