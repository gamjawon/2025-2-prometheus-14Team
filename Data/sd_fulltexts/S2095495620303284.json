Graphical abstract The synergistic effect of TiN nanocrystal with NG matrix can effectively restrain the shuttle effect of the Li polysulfides and accelerate the electrochemical reactions, leading to improved electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become prospective candidates for next-generation energy storage owing to the high energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish kinetics of the electrochemical reaction and shuttle effect result in a rapid capacity decay. Herein, a titanium nitride nanocrystal/N-doped graphene (TiN@NG) composite is developed to host elemental sulfur. The TiN nanoparticles decorated on graphene sheets attract Li polysulfides (LiPS x ) and catalyze the electrochemical reduction and oxidation of LiPS x in the discharge and charge processes, respectively. These two effects effectively restrain the dissolution of the LiPS x and accelerate the electrochemical reactions, thereby, alleviating the shuttle effect. As a result, the cathode composed of TiN@NG/S delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (1390 mA h g−1 at 0.1C) and excellent cycling performance (730 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles). We believe that this work can bring some inspiration for designing high-performance Li-S batteries. Keywords Titanium nitride Nitrogen-doped graphene Catalysis effects Adsorption capability Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1), high energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and relatively lower cost compared to conventional Li-ion batteries based on transition metal oxide cathodes [1–4]. Unfortunately, the development of Li-S batteries is limited by many obstacles. First, the electronic conductivities of both the elemental sulfur and Li2S (discharge product) are extremely poor, leading to the sluggish kinetics of the electrochemical reaction and low utilization of the S in cathode; second, the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS x , 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) tends to dissolve in the electrolyte and shuttle between the cathode and anode, which results in low electrochemical reversibility [5–9]. Thus, the high theoretical capacity of Li-S battery has rarely been achieved. Great research efforts have focused on optimizing the cathode of Li-S batteries to improve the electrochemical performance, which includes: 1) developing carbonaceous materials as electronic conductive supports of light in weight to accommodate elemental sulfur [10–13]; 2) tailoring the surface chemistry of the conductive supports to effectively bonding the LiPS x [14–16]. These strategies have improved the electrochemical performance of the S cathode to some extent, yet the slow reaction kinetics of the S cathode still limits the reversibility and rate capability of the battery [17]. The S cathode involves in a multi-electron redox reaction during the discharge-charge process. 75% of the theoretical capacity of the battery originates from the transformation of soluble Li2S4 to insoluble and nonconductive Li2S. The poor electronic conductivity of Li2S and the liquid (Li2S4)–solid (Li2S) phase transformation lead to sluggish kinetics, which causes an accumulation of soluble LiPS x , consequently the accelerated shuttle effect and also the arbitrary precipitation of solid Li2S in cathode. The large Li2S particles due to arbitrary precipitation are difficult to be reused because of their poor electronic conductivity. Therefore, the detrimental effects as the results of sluggish kinetics of the transformation of LiPS x significantly limits the cycling reversibility and stability of the S cathode [5,18–20]. Innovative strategies have been adopted to accelerate the conversion of LiPS x in discharge (to Li2S) and charge (to elemental sulfur) processes. Nazar et al. proposed the surface-enhanced redox reactions of LiPS x triggered by Magneli phase Ti4O7 [21,22]. And various nanoparticles made of metal sulfides [23–25] and metal oxides [26–28] were reported to be able to catalytically accelerate the conversion of LiPS x . Recently, our research group reported that Co-N coordination centres embedded in graphitic matrix can facilitate the reversible transformation between LiPS x and Li2S, which rendered a cathode of areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm−2 and capacity fading rate of 0.029% when the S mass ratio in the S-C composite was considerably high of 90 wt% [29]. On the other hand, transition metal nitrides (TMN) in range of IVB–VIB group (such as NbN, VN, TiN and MoN) have been extensively studied for the cathode of Li-S batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and capability to adsorb LiPS x , which can effectively suppress the shuttle effect [30–36]. Herein, we have successfully synthesized TiN nanocrystal anchored on N-doped graphene (TiN@NG) composite to accomodate elemental sulfur for the cathode of Li-S batteries. Encouragingly, the introducing of TiN on NG yields efficiently enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics for the conversion of LiPS x to insoluble Li2S (or Li2S2), and TiN has strong adsorption capability to LiPS x . These two effects facilitate the redox reactions with rapid electrons transfer during the discharge and charge process, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of intermediates and alleviate the shuttle effect. Consequently, the cathode composed of TiN@NG/S can deliver an initial capacity of 1390 mAh g−1 (at 0.1C), and the reversible capacity maintains a high value of 730 mAh g−1 (at 1C) after 300 cycles. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the TiN@NG and TiO2@rGO composites Typically, 0.75 g of titanium sulfate was firstly dissolved in 15 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring to achieve a complete dissolution. Meanwhile, 50 mg graphene oxide (GO) powder (Fig. S1, Supporting Information), which was prepared via a modified Hummers method [37], was dispersed in 25 mL deionized water and ultrasonicated for 3 h to obtain GO aqueous suspension. Subsequently, two solutions were mixed under vigorously stirring and transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. After heating at 100 °C for 6 h, the intermediate TiO2@GO precursor was centrifugalized and washed three times with deionized water followed by freeze-drying for 24 h. To synthesize the TiN@NG composite, the TiO2@GO precursor was annealed at 800 °C for 3 h under an NH3 flow. For comparison, a control sample, the TiO2 loading on reduced graphene oxide (TiO2@rGO) was prepared following the same procedure except for annealing the TiO2@GO precursor under Ar flow. 2.2 Preparation of TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S composites The preparation of the TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S composites were carried out by a typical melt-diffusion method. Specifically, the sublimed elemental sulfur powder and the TiN@NG (or TiO2@rGO) powder were uniformly mixed in a mass ratio of 7:3. The mixture was then transferred into an argon-protected container by maintaining at 155 °C for 10 h. 2.3 Materials characterization The crystalline phase of these materials were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, TTR-III with Cu Kα radiation) at scanning rate of 8° min−1. Structural and morphological characterization were obtained by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Specific surface area (SSA) and pore size distribution were carried out by the Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ instrument (BET, ASAP2020, Micromeritics, USA). To further analyse the chemical structure of these materials, Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) were also performed. The contents of the TiN (or TiO2) in TiN@NG (or TiO2@rGO) as well as the sulfur loading in both TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S composites were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TGAQ5000IR) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements To prepare the electrodes, TiN@NG/S (or TiO2@rGO/S) composite, Ketjen black, and PVDF binder were mixed at a mass ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurries. The slurries were then casted onto an aluminum foil. The areal S loading of the electrodes were about 1.2–1.5 mg cm−2. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated by using 2032 coin cells assembled in Ar-filled glove box. The TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S of sulfur mass ratios of 70 wt% were served as the working electrodes. The diameter of the circular electrode is 10 mm. Lithium metal foil was served as the counter/reference electrode and the separator was Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane. Moreover, the electrolyte was a 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (volume ratio 1:1) mixture solvent containing 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 2 wt% LiNO3. The amount of electrolyte was controlled by the quality of active material sulfur (15 μL mg−1). The symmetrical cells were assembled with two identical electrode disks as the working and counter electrodes, which consist of active materials (TiN@NG, TiO2@rGO, TiN, NG, or rGO, 80 wt%) and PVDF binder (20 wt%) coated on Al foil. The electrolyte contained 0.5 M Li2S6, 0.5 M LiTFSI, and 2.0 wt% LiNO3 dissolved in DOL/DME (volume ratio 1:1) solvent. The galvanostatic charge-discharge performance was achieved from LANDTE CT2001A battery test system in the voltage range of 1.6–2.8 V. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were performed in the voltage range of −1.4 to 1.4 V with scanning rate of 3 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were operated on an electrochemical workstation from 0.01 to 100 kHz (PARSTAT P4000A). 2.5 Polysulfides adsorption experiments Li2S6 solution was prepared by dissolving sublimation S and Li2S powders (mole ratio of 5:1) in the DOL/DME solvent (volume ratio of 1:1) followed by heating to 60 °C under magnetic stirring for 24 h. The concentration of Li2S6 was 10 mM. The adsorption tests were performed by dispersing 20 mg of composite powders (TiN@NG, TiO2@rGO, TiN, NG and rGO powders) in 3 ml of the Li2S6 solution. The suspensions were kept standing still for 10 h before being analyzed by the Ultraviolet (UV–vis) absorption spectrum (SpectraMax M5). 3 Results and discussion The preparation procedure of the TiN@NG composite is illustrated in Fig. 1 . During the hydrothermal reaction, the GO sheets provide nucleation sites for the formation of TiO2. Thus, the GO sheets decorated with nano-sized TiO2 particles were obtained [38]. Afterwards, the TiO2@GO composite was annealed at 800 °C for 3 h under NH3 flow, where the TiO2 was converted to TiN, and the GO was reduced and doped with N atoms to yield TiN@NG. The control sample, TiO2@rGO was prepared by annealing the TiO2@GO in argon flow at 800 °C for 3 h. The hydrothermal reaction yields TiO2 particles with size of 5–10 nm uniformly distributing on the GO sheets (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). After heat treatments at 800 °C, in either NH3 or Ar, the sizes of the particles are increased to 10–20 nm (Figs. 2 a and S2, Supporting Information), while the TiO2 are converted to TiN when NH3 was applied during the thermal annealing process (Fig. 2b). The increase of the particle size should be due to the crystallization and agglomeration of TiO2 and TiN crystallites to reach a lower energy state, which is enabled by the higher mass transport rate at elevated temperature. Moreover, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings in Fig. 2(c) show that the Ti and N elements are uniformly distributed. The formation of crystalline TiN was further confirmed by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3 a), in which strong diffraction peaks that can be indexed to the cubic phase of TiN (PDF# 38-1420) are observed without the diffraction peaks of TiO2. In contrast, the TiO2@rGO obtained by thermal annealing in Ar shows diffraction peaks that only matches hexagonal phase TiO2 (PDF# 21-1272). XPS spectra are further used to explore the chemical states of the Ti and N elements in the TiN@NG composite. As illustrated in Fig. 3(b), the Ti 2p spectrum presents two peaks at 456.0 and 457.0 eV, which can be assigned to the Ti-N and Ti-N-O bonds, respectively [39], which are also observed in the N 1s spectrum along with the C-N peak (Fig. 3c). The peak at 458.5 eV with a high intensity of Ti-O is clearly seen in the Ti 2p spectrum, which is due to the surface oxidation of the nano-sized TiN in the air [40]. Nevertheless, the XRD and XPS results confirm the formation of TiN nanocrystals on the N doped graphene sheets. The Raman spectra of the TiN@NG and TiO2@rGO are almost identical, which show broad D and G bands (Fig. S3, Supporting Information), indicating that the atmospheres applied during our thermal annealing process does not effectively altering the hybridization state of the carbon matrix [41]. TGA analyses are used to obtain the mass ratios of TiN and TiO2 in the composites (Fig. 3d), which are calculated to be 81.0 and 91.4 wt%, respectively (details for the calculations are shown in Supporting Information). Note that the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. 3e) reveal that the SSA of the TiN@NG composite is 143 m2 g−1 with pore volume and average pore diameter of 0.25 cm3 g−1 and 4.7 nm, respectively. The TiO2@rGO presents a similar average pore diameter of 5.7 nm (Fig. 3f) while a lower SSA (73.7 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.14 cm3 g−1) than those of the TiN@NG. The mesoporous structure of the TiN@NG and TiO2@rGO composites may originate from the stacking of TiN and TiO2 nanocrystals and the graphene sheets in the TiN@NG and TiO2@rGO composites, respectively, and the larger SSA of the TiN@NG may due to the etching of carbon atoms by NH3 during the thermal annealing. These porous structure features are favored for accommodating elemental sulfur for the cathode of the Li-S batteries. Sublimation sulfur was infiltrated into the sample by melt-diffusion method at 155 °C to obtain the TiN@NG/S composite. A sulfur mass loading of ~70 wt% (Fig. 4 a) was applied for structure characterization and electrochemical studies. In terms of the TiO2@rGO/S composite, the sulfur mass loading of around 70 wt% was also applied for comparative studies (Fig. S4, Supporting Information). Fig. 4(b) presents the morphology of the TiN@NG/S, from where the EDS mappings of the carbon, nitrogen, titanium, and sulfur elements (Fig. 4(c)) were acquired. The sulfur element map is almost identical to the morphology and the carbon, nitrogen, and titanium elements map except for some structure details, suggesting, at the sub-micrometer scale, a uniform dispersion of the sulfur in the TiN@NG/S composite. A uniform dispersion of sulfur in the TiO2@rGO/S composite was confirmed by the EDS analysis (Fig. S5, Supporting Information) to avoid the negative effects of nonuniform dispersion of sulfur on the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of the TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S electrodes were investigated in 2032 coin-type cells. Fig. 5 (a) illustrates the rate performance of the TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S electrodes at various current densities. It can be clearly seen that at different C-rates from 0.1C to 1.5C, the TiN@NG/S electrode delivers the high gravimetric capacities (calculated with respect to the mass of sulfur) of 1390, 1250, 1030, 910, and 850 mA h g−1. In contrast, the TiO2@rGO/S electrode can only deliver gravimetric capacities of 1230, 1050, 850, 530, and 200 mA h g−1, which are much smaller than those of the TiN@NG/S at the same C-rate. Note that the mass ratio of TiN in the TiN@NG was tuned by adjusting the GO/Ti(SO4)2 ratios during the hydrothermal reaction to achieve an optimized electrochemical performance (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). Remarkable, the gravimetric capacity of the TiN@NG/S at 1.5C (850 mA h g−1) is more than four times higher than that of the TiO2@rGO/S (200 mA h g−1) measured at the same experimental condition. Besides, when the C-rate returns to 0.2C, the reversible capacity of the TiN@NG/S electrode resumes to 1080 mA h g−1, indicating good resilience of the TiN@NG/S electrode. The corresponding discharge and charge profiles of these two types of electrode materials measured at different C-rates are depicted in Fig. 5(b) and (c). As expected, the TiN@NG/S sample shows a lower charge-discharge voltage hysteresis than the TiO2@rGO/S at 0.1C (0.17 versus 0.22 V), and the difference in voltage hystersis between the two composites increases with the C-rate. The much lower voltage hysteresis observed in the discharge-charge profiles is in accordance with the much lower charge transfer resistance of TiN@NG/S (35 Ω) than that of the TiO2@rGO/S (75 Ω) obtained from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5d). The cycling performance of these two composites measured at 0.2C are presented in Fig. 5(e). The TiN@NG/S delivers an initial capacity of 1310 mA h g−1 and a high reversible capacity of 830 mA h g−1 is maintained after 100 cycles. In comparison, the TiO2@rGO/S can only deliver an initial capacity of 1140 mA h g−1 and its reversible capacity drops to 690 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The EIS of the TiN@NG/S and TiO2@rGO/S electrodes after 100 times cycling were further acquired. The impedance of TiO2@rGO/S electrode increases from 75 to 106 Ω while that of the TiN@NG/S electrode only gains tiny from 35 to 46 Ω after 100 times cycling (Fig. S7, Supporting Information), indicating that TiN@NG is more favorable to host sulfur. To further investigate the long-term cycling stability of the TiN@NG/S electrode, galvanostatic discharge-charge processes are evaluated at 1C for 300 cycles. Note that the initial two cycles are tested at 0.2C to active the electrode. When the charge and discharge rate turn into 1C, the TiN@NG/S cathode delivers a specific capacity of 1070 mA h g−1 with high coulombic efficiency of 99.3%. After 300 cycles, the reversible capacity can still reaches 730 mA h g−1, rendering a slow capacity decay rate of 0.1% per cycle. The TiN@NG/S shows improved cycling and rate performance than TiO2@rGO/S, and the reduced discharge-charge hysteresis and charge transfer resistance. Notably, mass ratios of sulfur (70 wt%) in the two electrodes are the same, and the mass ratios of TiN (81 wt%) and TiO2 (91 wt%) in the graphene based composites are also very close. In order to explore the mechanism of the improved electrochemical performance observed from the TiN@NG/S electrode, CVs were conducted on symmetric cells (see details in the experimental section). The CV test starts with a cathodic scan in the voltage range of open circuit voltage (0 V) to −1.4 V, which is followed by an anodic scan in the voltage range of −1.4−1.4 V. Finally, the voltage sweep back to 0 V to complete the CV measurement. As depicted in Fig. 6 (a), the CV profile of the TiN@NG exhibits two cathodic peaks at −0.16 and −0.5 V and two anodic peaks at 0.16 and 0.5 V. The cathodic peak at −0.5 V arises from the reduction of Li2S6 to Li2S (or Li2S2) on the working electrode and the simultaneous oxidation of Li2S6 to S8 on the counter electrode. The anodic peaks at 0.16 and 0.5 V can be attributed to the oxidation reactions of Li2S (or Li2S2) to Li2S6 and the conversion of Li2S6 to elemental S8, respectively. And the last peak at −0.16 V during the CV test is due to the reduction process of S8 to Li2S6 on the working electrode. These pronounced cathodic and anodic peaks observed from the CV profile of the symmetric cell assembled with TiN@NG indicate the accelerated kinetics of the electrochemical conversion of LiPS x (here represented by Li2S6) [42]. The CVs of the control samples, nitrogen doped graphene (NG) and titanium nitride (TiN) powder, also show these four redox peaks, but with significantly lower current densities and greater voltage polarization (Fig. S8, Supporting Information). Notably, these redox peaks are not observed in the CV profiles acquired from the TiO2@rGO and rGO. Therefore, the introducing of TiN on NG yields efficiently enhance electrochemical reaction kinetics for the conversion of LiPS x . Furthermore, the LiPS x adsorption capabilities of these materials were examined by comparing the color changes and the UV–vis spectra of the Li2S6 solutions mixed with different composite powders (Fig. 6b). Compared with the Li2S6 solution without mixing with any powders, the solution containing TiN@NG powder is almost colorless while the solution mixed with TiO2@rGO is pale yellow, which is in accordance to the much weaker absorption in the wavelength range of 330 to 450 nm that originates from the Li2S6 (Fig. 6b). These results indicate a stronger adsorption capability to LiPS x of TiN@NG than that of TiO2@rGO, which can be ascribed to the synergistic dual bonding, Li–N and Ti–S, with binding energy of as high as 4.43 eV, much larger than those of TiO2 [43]. Accordingly, a negligible adsorption capabilities to LiPS x of NG and rGO is found from the UV–vis spectra, thus the adsorption of LiPS x of TiN@NG is owing to the strong chemical adsorption capability of TiN. Overall, the improved electrochemical performance of the TiN@NG/S should be originate from the TiN that are decorating on the graphene sheets (Fig. 6c). First, TiN is capable to accelerate the electrochemical conversion of LiPS x , in both the reduction of LiPS x in the discharge process and the oxidation of LiPS x in the charge process (Fig. 6a). The improved electrochemical reaction kinetics reduces discharge-charge voltage hysteresis and charge transfer resistance, rendering an improved rate capability of the TiN@NG/S electrode. Plus, the effective conversion of LiPS x by TiN@NG together with the strong capability of TiN in adsorbing the LiPS x further restrain the dissolution of these discharge-charge intermediates (Fig. 6b), which remits the shuttle effect and consequently improves the cycling reversibility and life. 4 Conclusions In summary, we developed a composite material consisting of TiN nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene, which was prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction. The resulted composite shows improved cycling reversibility and stability when serves as a cathode for Li-S battery. The TiN nanoparticles and N dopants in graphene sheets accelerate the electrochemical conversion of LiPS x in both the discharge and charge processes, and the TiN shows strong adsorption capability to the LiPS x . These two effects can effectively improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics and restrain the dissolution of LiPS x , thereby, alleviating the shuttle effect. Improved reversible capacity (1390 mA h g−1 versus 1150 mA h g−1 for the TiO2@rGO/S at 0.1C), rate capability (860 mA h g−1 versus 210 mA h g−1 for the TiO2@rGO/S at 1.5C), and long-term cycling performance (730 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles).

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become prospective candidates for next-generation energy storage owing to the high energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish kinetics of the electrochemical reaction and shuttle effect result in a rapid capacity decay. Herein, a titanium nitride nanocrystal/N-doped graphene (TiN@NG) composite is developed to host elemental sulfur. The TiN nanoparticles decorated on graphene sheets attract Li polysulfides (LiPS x ) and catalyze the electrochemical reduction and oxidation of LiPS x in the discharge and charge processes, respectively. These two effects effectively restrain the dissolution of the LiPS x and accelerate the electrochemical reactions, thereby, alleviating the shuttle effect. As a result, the cathode composed of TiN@NG/S delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (1390 mA h g−1 at 0.1C) and excellent cycling performance (730 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles). We believe that this work can bring some inspiration for designing high-performance Li-S batteries.",
