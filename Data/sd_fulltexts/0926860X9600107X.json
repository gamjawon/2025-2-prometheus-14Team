Sendai 980-77, Japan Received 15 August 1995; revised 15 December 1995; accepted 27 February 1996 Abstract A sulfided K-MoO3/~-AI203 catalyst with excellent activity for the synthesis of mixed alcohols was prepared. By a durability test of 1300 h, it was found that the initial reaction activity over the catalyst is quite low and the activity increases obviously with reaction time in the first 15 h, then the increase of the activity becomes rather slow and the activity curve becomes horizontal after reaction for 200 h. In the whole process of 1300 h reaction the activity for alcohol synthesis did not show any sign of decrease. So the catalyst possesses excellent reaction stability. According to the structural studies, the major component of the fresh sulfided sample is an MoS2-1ike structure, accompanied by a small amount of Mo-S species with different valences of Mo and S atoms. In the catalytic reaction process, some of the sulphur species including that coordinated with Mo atoms is lost. The Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination number for the post-reaction sample decreases notably compared to that for the fresh sulfided sample; and some highly coordinated unsaturated sites are formed, which may be favourable for the formation of catalytic active centers for the synthesis of mixed alcohols. The existence of these coordinated unsaturated sites may be the reason for the fact that a part of the Mo4+ species is oxidized and converted to Mo~+ and Mo~- species while contacting with air in the short time for structural measurements.

Bian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 79-91 moter, the catalyst shows excellent activity for the mixed alcohol synthesis from CO hydrogenation [1-6]. The Mo based catalyst has been studied by a variety of techniques and by many researchers in order to determine the structural features of the catalyst and to relate these features to the catalytic performance. Many authors have studied the effect of Co and Ni promoter on the structure and catalytic performance for different hydrogenation processes of the modified Mo catalyst. Some authors have published papers concerning the effect of a potassium promoter. Woo et al. have studied the structure and catalytic features of K2CO3 promoted MoS2 catalyst for the synthesis of mixed alcohols [7-9]. Recently, Knozinger et al. have studied the structure of supported potassium promoted Mo catalyst with laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) etc. [10,11]. In recent years, supported K-MoO3 catalysts have been studied in our laboratory for the synthesis of mixed alcohols from CO hydrogenation. The results about the effect of different supports, potassium content and preparation conditions on the structure and catalytic activity for the mixed alcohols synthesis have been published [4,5,12-14]. A new Mo based catalyst was successfully prepared which showed high activity for the synthesis of mixed alcohols [4,15]. In this work, we report the results about the catalytic durability for the mixed alcohol synthesis and the structural changes during the reaction. Some important information about the formation of a catalytic active center has been obtained. 2. Experimental 2.1. Sample preparation The oxidic sample was prepared by impregnating \"y-A1203 support (produced by Institute of Tianjing Chemical Engineering, BET surface area was 270 m2/g) with the aqueous KC1 solutions, followed by drying at 120 for 6 h and calcination in air at 300 for 1 h. Then this sample was impregnated with a (NHn)6MOTO24\" 4H20 solution, followed by drying and calcination in a flow of 02 at 500 for 24 h, and calcination in air at 800 for 12 h. The sulfided sample was obtained by calcination of the oxidic sample in a flow (30 ml/min) of CS2/H2 (obtained by H2 passing through 0 CS2 liquid) at 400 for 6 h. Both the fresh sulfided and post-reaction samples were kept in small bottles filled with N2 before structural measurement. The molybdenum content in the sample, expressed as MoO3/A1203 weight ratio, is 0.24, and the potassium content, as K/Mo atomic ratio, is 0.8. 2.2. Catalytic durability measurement Catalytic durability of the sulfided K-MoO3/Y-A1203 catalyst on the mixed alcohol synthesis from syngas was measured with a fixed bed flow reactor G.-z. Bian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 79-91 81 equipped with an on-line gas chromatography. 0.5 ml sample was used for the experiment. The synthesis gas was composed of CO 33%, H2 55% and N2 12%. The effluent gas from the reactor was directed into a sample valve on the gas chromatography and was kept > 200 by a heating band. The product was analyzed by a hydrogen flame ionization detector with N2 as carrier gas and a 2 m Porapak Q column for separating the hydrocarbon and alcohol products, and a thermal conductivity detector with Ar as carrier gas and a 2 m TDX-01 column for separating CO, CO2, H2 and N2. 2.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement The spectra were recorded on an XSAM800 spectrometer (Physical and Chemical Analysis Center of Beijing) using an A1 KoL X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The measurements were performed under a vacuum of at least 10 7 Pa. Binding energies were recorded for the Mo3d, S2p, Kzp, Ois and CI~ regions. The Alzp peak (74.5 eV) associated with support and the C ~ peak (285.0 eV) associated with the hydrocarbon impurities present on the sample surface were used as reference standard for binding energy calibration. The atomic ratios of the surface species on the sulfided samples were calculated from peak areas corrected by Wagner's sensitivity factors [16]. The Mo(6 + )3d5/2, Mo(5 + )3a5/2, and Mo(4 +)3a5/2 binding energies used for the deconvolution of the Mo3a regions were 232.6, 231.0, and 229.0 eV, respectively. 2.4. Total sulphur analysis The total sulphur contents of the fresh sulfided sample and the post-reaction sample were determined by the combustion of the samples at 673 K in oxygen flow (1000 cm3/min). Sulphur oxide was trapped and titrated with KIO3. 2.5. EXAFS measurement X-ray absorption data round the Mo-K-absorption edge were collected at the EXAFS station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The measure- ments were performed at room temperature with ionization chambers filled with Ar. For the EXAFS measurements, the precalculated amounts of samples were grounded and pressed into plan-parallel rectangular tablets and the reference compounds were mounted between pieces of adhesive tape. The thickness of the samples was chosen such that ix x = 1 on the high absorption side of the edge. The X-ray, which were emitted by positron in the storage ring with an energy of 2.2 GeV and a typical current of 45 mA, were monochromatized by two Si(l 11 ) single crystals. All spectra were obtained at 5 eV steps from 19800 eV to 19950 eV, 1 eV steps from 19950 eV to 20150 eV and 5 eV steps from 20150 eV to 21000 eV. 82 G.-z. Bian et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 79-91 Some samples were measured on the Laboratory EXAFS equipped with a rotating-gold-anode X-ray source and a double-crystal monochromator in To- hoku University, Japan. MoS2 compound used as reference sample for the EXAFS calculation was also measured at the Photon Factory in the Japanese National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. Similar results were obtained from these measurements under different facilities. The EXAFS data analysis used here involved a background subtraction by means of cubic spline functions, multiplication of the EXAFS by a factor k 3 and normalization by the jump height at the K edge. Fourier transform ranges for all samples are 30.0-130.0 nm-J. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic durabiliw The sulfided K-MoO3/~/-AI203 catalyst was tested for the synthesis of mixed alcohols from syngas under the conditions of P = 4.0-14.0 MPa, GHSV = 3000-11000 h-1, and T= 340-385. The conversion of CO toward alco- hols was calculated by analyzing the composition of the collected product. The results demonstrated that this catalyst shows excellent ability to synthesize mixed alcohols from syngas. Under the reaction conditions of 385, 14.0 MPa and 11000 h J, the space-time yield is 416.7 ml/1 h and the alcohol selectiv- ity is 82% [15].

Bian et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 79-91 83 The test of catalytic durability of this sulfided K-MoO3/7-A1203 catalyst ibr mixed alcohol synthesis was performed for more than 1300 h under the reaction conditions of 340, 4.0 MPa and 3600 h-I. The results are shown in Fig. 1. A long period of about 200 h was needed for the reaction to reach a final steady state. In initial 15 h, the CO conversion to alcohols increased rapidly with the time on stream. After reaction for more than 15 h, the increase of the CO conversion becomes rather slow. Alter reaction for 200 h, the activity curve becomes horizontal, and the activity kept in a steady state in the next 1100 h. No significant decrease of the activity toward alcohol formation was seen in the whole 1300 h durability test. The experiment demonstrated that methanol was predominant in the alcohols product(C~OH/Cz+OH = 1.2) and the contents of the alcohols with two or more carbon numbers decreased gradually with increasing carbon number. The product distribution did not show obvious changes with reaction time. The total alcohol selectivity (as carbon atom percentage) is about 60%, the product contains some hydrocarbons with methane as most abundant. The activity toward hydrocarbon formation changes with time on stream in a similar tendency to the alcohol formation (not shown in the Fig. 1). 3.2. XPS The surface compositions of fresh sulfided K-MoO3/7-A1203 samples and a post-reaction sample over which reaction toward alcohol formation had been performed for 200 h were determined by XPS. Figs. 2 and 3 show the S2p and the Mo3d spectra, respectively. 158 163 168 173 Binding energy (eV) Fig. 2.

XPS Spectra of the MOzp region of fresh sulfided K-MoO3/'y-Al203 catalyst (a), and 200 h post-reaction K-MoO3 / 7-A1203 catalyst (b). In Fig. 2a, the spectrum for fresh sulfided sample is dominated by the 82p3/2 peak of MoS2 at about 162.0 eV [16]. The broadened peak shape shows that this peak also includes the contribution from some additional Mo-S species, they are assigned to a subsulfide MoS2_x at 161.0 eV and a polysulfide S2- at 163.0 eV [17,18]. Another small peak at about 169.0 eV on the Szp spectrum is due to a sulfate species (804)2- [16]. Fig. 2b displays the spectrum taken after 200 h reaction for alcohol synthesis. Compared to the fresh sulfided sample, the absolute concentration of the higher binding energy component remains constant while the species at about B.E. -- 162.0 eV decreased remarkably in the concen- tration. This change may be due to the loss of the sulphur species on the sample during the reaction. Fig. 3a presents the MO3d spectrum for the fresh sulfided sample. The major component in the spectrum is same as the MO3d peaks in MoS2, for which the binding energy of MO3ds/2 is about 229.0 eV and that of MO3d3/2 is about 232.5 eV [16], along with the minor contributions from some unreduced Mo5+ and Mo6+ components. For Mo5+ and Mo6+ components, the binding energies of MO3ds/2 are shifted to 231.0 eV and 232.6 eV [16,18], respectively. Fig. 3b shows a change in the spectrum after reaction toward mixed alcohol formation for 200 h. There is a significant increase in the intensity of the peak due to Mo5+ and Mo6+ species and a concurrent decrease in the intensity of the peak for the MoS2 component. Table 1 shows the relative concentration of different Mo species on the fresh and post-reaction sample, which indicates that some MoS2-1ike species has been converted into Mo5+ and Mo6+ species. In the present work, the catalyst samples were not sulfided in-situ for XPS measurement, and during the reaction the catalyst was exposed to the strongly G.-z.

So the large amount of Mo5+ and Mo6+ species observed on the post-reaction sample should be attributed to the oxidation of the sample while exposed to air in a short time for XPS measurement. This may be caused by the formation of highly coordinated unsaturated sites, e.g. active sites, during the reaction. The existence of these sites made it easier for the catalyst to be oxidized while contacting with air. Table 2 presents the relative atomic concentration on the fresh and post-reac- tion samples according to the XPS measurements. The results show a notable decrease in the concentration of surface sulphur and a little increase in the relative concentration of surface, O, A1 and K components. These results should be caused by the loss of surface sulphur species, which make some O, AI and K components in the inner layer of the samples be exposed to the surface and could be detected by XPS. 3.3. Total sulphur analysis The sulphur contents of fresh and two post-reaction K-MoO3/',/-A1203 samples from total sulphur analysis are shown in Table 3. The atomic ratio of sulphur to molybdenum for fresh sulfided sample is 2.4. After reaction for mixed alcohol synthesis for 80 h and 200 h, the atomic ratios of sulphur to molybdenum on the catalyst decrease to 1.8 and 1.6, respectively. These results clearly show the loss of sulphur species on the sample during the reaction, which are in good agreement with the result obtained from XPS. It is seen from total sulphur analysis that about 25% of total sulphur on the sample is lost in the first 80 h reaction, and only a little more than 8% of total sulphur is lost in the next 120 h reaction. It is significant that the loss of total sulphur tend to be leveled with increasing reaction time.

According to literature [19,20], S/Mo atomic ratio on the sulfided MoO3/'y-Al203 sample is usually below 2, but the S/Mo atomic ratio on sulfided Co-promoted sample was higher than 2 [20], which is similar to the results in this paper. 3.4. EXAFS The EXAFS spectra for well-crystallized MoS2, the flesh sulfided K- MoO3/'y-A1203 sample and the 200 h post-reaction sample were measured. The radial distribution functions round the center Mo atoms in the three samples, as determined by Fourier transformation of the EXAFS data, is shown in Fig. 4, where R is the uncorrected radial distance from the absorbing Mo atom.

The location of the peak due to the second coordination shell (R = 0.285 nm) is also found to be essentially identical in all three samples, but the magnitude of this peak is substantially lower in the catalysts (Fig. 4b and c) than in MoS2. There is also obvious difference between the magnitude of the second peak for fresh catalyst sample and for post-reaction catalyst sample. In crystalline MoS2, the center Mo atom has been surrounded by S atoms in the first coordination shell and Mo atoms in the second shell, thus the first peak situated at 0.19 nm in the radial distribution of the MoS2 compound is attributed to S atoms and the second peak at 0.285 nm is due to Mo backscattering atoms. The Mo-S and Mo-Mo interatomic distances in MoS2 are 0.241 nm and 0.316 nm, respectively [21-23]. The locations of the Mo-S and Mo-Mo peaks in the radial distribution function are downshifted about 0.05 nm and 0.03 nm, respectively, which is caused by the transferability of the phase shifts. The Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination numbers in MoS2 compound are both equal to 6 [22]. In order to separate the contribution from different coordination shells, a region surrounding each of the two main peak in the radial distribution function shown in Fig. 4 was transformed back into k-space.

It is seen that the shape of the EXAFS oscillations for the samples are similar, but the amplitude for the catalysts are smaller compared to those for MoS2 crystalline, which is in accordance with the Fourier transforms. By single-shell fitting of the back transformation data of the Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination shells on the catalysts using the results of MoS2 as referencing standard, the structural parameters for the nearest Mo-S and Mo-Mo shells were obtained, which are shown in Table 4. The Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination distances on the catalyst samples are the same as that in MoS2. These results suggest that Mo on the catalysts is presented as an MoS2-1ike species. The Mo-S coordination number for fresh sulfided sample is 5.1, which is near to that for MoS2. This result implies that the Mo species in the catalyst has a low degree of disorder in the first Mo-S coordination shell, and the structure Table 4 The local structural parameters around the center Mo atom of fresh and post-reaction K-MoO3/~-AI203 samples from EXAFS analysis Sample Mo-S Mo-Mo N R (nm) N R (rim) Fresh 5.1 0.240 3.4 0.316 80 h post-reaction 4.6 0.241 3.2 0.316 200 h post-reaction 3.5 0.241 2.6 0.316 G.-z.

But for the post-reaction sample, the Mo-S coordination number is 3.5, which is much smaller than that for the fresh catalyst sample. The obvious changes in the structure of the nearest Mo-S shell may be caused by the loss of sulphur species during the reaction. The Mo-Mo coordination numbers for both fresh and post-reaction sulfided samples are obvious lower than that for the MoS2 compound. The much lower coordination numbers indicate that the MoSz-like species in the catalysts are different in the local structure of the second coordination shell round center Mo atoms from crystalline MoS2 [22,23]. The reduction of the Mo-Mo coordination number for post-reaction samples compared to that for fresh samples implies the formation of the coordinated unsaturated Mo sites during the reaction. Total sulphur analysis shows that the S/Mo atomic ratio on the fresh sulfided sample is 2.4, while the Mo-S coordination number is 5.1 according to EXAFS analysis. On the supposition that all of the sulphur existing on the sample is coordinated with Mo atoms, each sulphur atom should be coordinated by 5.1/2.4 = 2.1 Mo atoms on an average. Since some of sulfur is not coordinated with Mo atoms, most of the sulfur atoms around Mo atoms in the sample should be coordinated with at least 2 Mo atoms, which demonstrates clearly that the Mo species on the sample are present in the form of a chain-like structure with Mo-S-Mo bonds as basic building units. The much small value of Mo-Mo coordination number from EXAFS analysis may suggest a high disorder of Mo-Mo coordination. A Debye-Waller correction was made in the process of the quantitative structure parameter calculations, but it may be inappropriate if a non-Gaussian disorder is present [22,24,25]. So, the local structure of Mo-S-Mo bonds on the catalyst sample is structurally different from crystalline MoS2, in which the Mo-S-Mo bonds are present with lower disorder and each sulphur atom is coordinated with 3 Mo atoms. High dispersion of the small MoS2 crystallites on the sample surface would readily explain these effect. The reduction of Mo-Mo coordination number of post-reaction sample indicates the further increase of the structural disorder, which is probably attributed to the creation of sulphur vacancies during the reaction. The results from XPS and total sulphur analysis demonstrate clearly the loss of sulphur in the initial reaction process. However, sulphur on the fresh sample was presented with different states including polysulfide and adsorbing sulphur [ 12], which have been thought to be easily lost during the reaction. The results from EXAFS analysis demonstrate that the sulphur atoms in the nearest coordi- nation shell around the center Mo atom are lost and the local structure in the shell is changed during the reaction. The test of catalytic durability for the synthesis of mixed alcohols exhibits lower initial activity and a gradually increase of the activity toward mixed alcohols synthesis in the first 200 h of the reaction. These results suggest that the observed changes in the structure may be a process of the formation of a catalytic active center for the synthesis of mixed alcohols. 90 G.-z. Bian et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 79-91 4. Conclusion The sulfided K-MoO3/~/-A1203 catalyst shows excellent reaction stability for the synthesis of mixed alcohols from syngas. Its initial reaction activity is quite low and the activity increases obviously with reaction time in the first 15 h, then the increase of the activity becomes rather slow and the activity curve becomes horizontal after reaction for 200 h. In the whole process of 1300 h reaction the activity toward alcohol synthesis did not show any sign of decrease. According to the structural studies, the major component on the fresh sulfided sample is a MoS2-1ike species, along with small amounts of Mo-contained species with different valences of Mo and S atoms. In the catalytic reaction process, some of the sulphur species including that coordinated with Mo atoms are lost and the Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination number for the post-reaction sample decreases notably compared to that for fresh sulfided sample, which makes the formation of some highly coordinated unsaturated sites possible. These changes may be favourable for the formation of a catalytic active center for the synthesis of mixed alcohols.

Tel. (+86-551) 3601118, fax. (+86-551) 3631760 A sulfided KMoO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with excellent activity for the synthesis of mixed alcohols was prepared. By a durability test of 1300 h, it was found that the initial reaction activity over the catalyst is quite low and the activity increases obviously with reaction time in the first 15 h, then the increase of the activity becomes rather slow and the activity curve becomes horizontal after reaction for 200 h. In the whole process of 1300 h reaction the activity for alcohol synthesis did not show any sign of decrease. So the catalyst possesses excellent reaction stability. According to the structural studies, the major component of the fresh sulfided sample is an MoS2-like structure, accompanied by a small amount of MoS species with different valences of Mo and S atoms. In the catalytic reaction process, some of the sulphur species including that coordinated with Mo atoms is lost. The MoS and MoMo coordination number for the post-reaction sample decreases notably compared to that for the fresh sulfided sample; and some highly coordinated unsaturated sites are formed, which may be favourable for the formation of catalytic active centers for the synthesis of mixed alcohols. The existence of these coordinated unsaturated sites may be the reason for the fact that a part of the Mo4+ species is oxidized and converted to Mo5+ and Mo6+ species while contacting with air in the short time for structural measurements.
