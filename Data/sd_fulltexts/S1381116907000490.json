Tel.: +86 22 27401476. The performance of La2NiO4 perovskite catalysts, prepared using a citric acid complexation method, for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas has been studied. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental studies show that the calcination temperature and the amount of citric acid (CA) have a significant influence on the characteristics of the catalysts and their catalytic activity. Among the catalysts tested, the La2NiO4 catalyst calcined at 850°C with a molar ratio of La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 exhibited the best activity and excellent stability as well as very low coke formation. Graphical abstract Performances of La2NiO4 perovskite, prepared using citric acid complex method, as catalysts for partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas have been studied. The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TG/DTG and SEM. Among catalysts tested, the catalyst La2NiO4 calcinated at 850°C with the molar ratio of La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 exhibits the best activity and excellent stability as well as very low coke formation. Keywords Partial oxidation of methane Perovskite La2NiO4 catalyst Preparation 1 Introduction The partial oxidation of methane (POM) to synthesis gas has attracted both academic and industrial interest. Compared with conventional steam reforming, which is very energy and capital intensive, POM is more energy efficient and can be carried out with a much lower investment of capital. POM produces synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of ca. 2, which is suitable for use in the production of methanol and Fisher-Tropsch synthesis. The catalysts reported to be active for the POM to synthesis gas are either noble metal catalysts, like Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru, particularly Ru [1–4], or Ni-based catalysts. Despite the high activity of noble metal based catalysts, the high cost of such systems limits their widespread industrial application. Ni catalysts, usually supported on alumina and silica, have been most extensively studied [5–11], the major drawback of this reaction, however, is the rapid deactivation caused by carbon deposition. One promising method for the inhibition of carbon deposition over Ni catalysts is using perovskite-type oxides. Lago et al. [12] observed that a series of LnCoO3 (Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, or Gd) perovskites gave high activity and selectivity for the POM to synthesis gas. Choudhary et al. [13] reported that complex oxides with a perovskite structure, like LaNiO3, La0.8Ca (or Sr)0.2NiO3 and LaNi1−X Co X O3 (X =0.2–1.0), were resistant to coking. Takehira et al. [14] found that Ni supported on perovskites like Ni0.2/ATiO3 (A:Ca, Sr or Ba), which were prepared by solid phase crystallization, showed good activity and selectivity as well as very low coke formation. In addition, carbon deposition can be suppressed by the use of alkaline oxides or rare earth oxides in catalysts [15,16]. Tsipouriari et al. [17,18] investigated the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas over a Ni/La2O3 catalyst. They found that CH4 conversion and H2 selectivity were close to thermodynamic predictions, However, Ni catalysts suffer from the problem of coke formation. To inhibit carbon deposition, one must keep the size of the metal clusters smaller than the critical size needed for coke formation [19]. In this paper, the Ni catalyst from K2NiF4-type perovskite oxides La2NiO4 exhibits high activity and a rather high stability. The effects of calcination temperature and citric acid concentration on the structure and the catalytic activity for the partial oxidation of methane were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The La2NiO4 catalyst was prepared by a citric acid complexation method. Stoichiometric amounts of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and La(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved completely in de-ionized water, and a stoichiometric amount of citric acid was mixed into the solution. The solution was then heated to 80°C with constant stirring until a gel formed. The gel was then dried at 110°C for 12h, and subsequently calcined at different temperature for 5h. The calcined samples were pressed, crushed and sieved to obtain a particle size of 0.40–0.50mm. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out on Philips PANalytical apparatus with Co Kα radiation, at 40kV and 40mA. The diffraction angle (2θ) was scanned from 10° to 90°. Specific areas were calculated using the BET method from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms, recorded at the temperature of liquid nitrogen on a NOVA-2000 instrument. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under an oxidative atmosphere with a Pyris Diamond analyzer. About 10mg of sample was heated from room temperature to 850°C at 10°C/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a PHILIPS XL30 scanning electron microscope operating at 20kV. 2.3 Activity measurement The partial oxidation of methane (POM) was carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor (8mm i.d.) at atmospheric pressure. A 100mg sample of the catalysts was diluted with SiC (SiC/catalyst=1) in order to avoid hot spots and was placed between quartz-wool swatches in the middle of the reactor. The reactor was kept in a tubular furnace and its temperature was controlled by a thermocouple, which was placed in the center of the catalyst bed. The catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2 at 500°C for 1h before the reaction. The reaction mixture was fed by mass-flow controllers at a total flow rate of 98mL/min with a molar ratio of CH4:O2:N2 =2:1:4. The products were analyzed on-line by a GC900 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a TDX-01 column. The conversion of CH4, the selectivities of CO and H2 are defined as follows: X C H 4 ( % ) = [ C H 4 ] o [ C H 4 ] i − [ C H 4 ] o × 100 S H 2 ( % ) = [ H 2 ] o 2 × [ C H 4 ] i − [ C H 4 ] o × 100 X CO ( % ) = [ CO ] o [ C H 4 ] i − [ C H 4 ] o × 100 where [CH4]i are inlet flow rates, and [CH4]o, [H2]o and [CO]o are outlet flow rates. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Influence of the calcination temperature The XRD patterns of La2NiO4 samples calcined at different temperature are shown in Fig. 1 . After the amorphous precursor was calcined at 500°C for 4h, intense peaks for La2O3 were observed. When the temperature was increased to 700°C, typical diffraction peaks for the perovskite-like oxide La2NiO4, which is identified as single phase with a tetragonal K2NiF4 structure, as well as a small amount of La2O3 were observed. When the calcination temperature was increased to 1000°C, the diffraction peaks for the spinel structure significantly intensified and became sharper, which suggests that the crystalline phase of La2NiO4 became more perfect. This result indicates that La2NiO4 with pure spinel structure can be formed by complexing citric acid with a mixture of La3+ and Ni2+ and calcining the obtained gel above 700°C. The specific surface areas and crystal sizes of the La2NiO4, calculated from the half-width of a diffraction peak using Scherrer's formula, are listed in Table 1 . Upon increasing calcination temperature, the particle sizes increased, and the specific surface area decreased dramatically, especially for the La2NiO4 catalyst calcined at 1000°C. The drop in specific surface area may originate from the aggregate of the perovskite phase, which indicates the structure properties are significantly dependent on the calcination temperature. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of CH4, the selectivities of H2 and CO and the H2/CO ratio over La2NiO4 catalysts which have been caicined at different temperatures. The activity of the La2NiO4 catalyst increases with the increase in calcination temperature from 500 to 850°C, but the activity of the La2NiO4 catalyst calcined at 1000°C was remarkably lower than those calcined at 500°C, 700°C or 850°C. The La2NiO4 catalyst calcined at 850°C showed the highest POM activity and remained constant during the 80h test (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the activity of the La2NiO4 catalysts for the POM is sensitive to the calcination temperature of the precursors. 3.2 Influence of the amount of citric acid Citric acid (CA) was used as a chelating reagent in the synthesis of the La2NiO4 powders. The amount of citric acid plays an important role in the morphology and activity of the catalysts. If the amount of citric acid is too low, some of the ions may not chelate with the citric acid and resulting gel may not be homogeneous. On the other hand, too much citric acid causes waste and precipitation from unchelated citrate. The SEM micrographs of the catalysts with different molar ratios of La:Ni:CA are shown in Fig. 3 . An homogeneous phase is visible (Fig. 4 ) when molar ratios of La:Ni:CA is 2:1:1 and 2:1:3, thus we propose that this technique is a good and convenient method to disperse the active metal. While the catalyst powders with La:Ni:CA=2:1:4 have the relatively large average granularity due to significant agglomeration of fine powders. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the La2NiO4 catalysts calcined at 850°C with different mole ratios of La:Ni:CA. All these catalysts exhibit the characteristic diffraction lines for the La2NiO4 spinel structure. Weak diffraction lines of NiO are also observed in the catalysts with La:Ni:CA=2:1:1 and La:Ni:CA=2:1:4. This phenomenon indicates that the optimal amount of citric acid needed to obtain a pure perovskite structure of La2NiO4 is La:Ni:CA=2:1:3. The surface areas of fresh and used La2NiO4 catalysts prepared with different amount of citric acid are listed in Table 2 . As the amount of citric acid increases from La:Ni:CA=2:1:1 to 2:1:4, the specific surface area of the fresh catalysts decreased from 7.78 to 6.48m2/g. After the POM reaction, the specific surface area for La:Ni:CA=2:1:1 decreased dramatically, and that for La:Ni:CA=2:1:4 decreased slightly, but the specific surface area for La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 was almost the same. This suggests that the La2NiO4 catalyst with La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 has the most stable structure. The conversion of CH4, the selectivities of H2 and CO and the H2/CO ratio over La2NiO4 with different molar radios of La:Ni:CA were studied and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . In the temperature range of 600–850°C, the catalysts with La:Ni:CA=2:1:1 and 2:1:3 exhibited fairly good conversion of CH4 and good selectivities for H2 and CO. The ratio of H2/CO produced was close to 2. In contrast, the catalyst with La:Ni:CA=2:1:4 had very low activity. When the reaction temperature was below 750°C, the conversion and the selectivities are higher for La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 than for La:Ni:CA=2:1:1. 3.3 Stability of La2NiO4 catalyst Fig. 6 shows the conversion of CH4, and selectivities for CO and H2 as a function of time on stream over a La2NiO4 catalyst using a feed molar ratio of CH4:O2:N2 =2:1:4. Over a period of 80h, the CH4 conversion was above 97%, and CO and H2 selectivities remained above 98% and 95%, respectively, which suggests that the La2NiO4 catalyst is quite stable and catalytically highly active. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh, reduced and used La2NiO4 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 For the fresh La2NiO4 catalyst, typical diffraction peaks for the La2NiO4 spinel structure were observed. After the catalyst was reduced by hydrogen at 500°C for 1h, most of the diffraction peaks attributed to La2NiO4 disappeared, whereas those belonging to La2O3 appeared, and nickel exists chiefly as Ni0, and the average crystal size of Ni0(21nm)for La2NiO4(after reduction), obtained from the XRD line broadening, is found to be much smaller than that (125nm) for Ni-La2O3 [20].This suggests that the La2NiO4 has been reduced and decomposed by hydrogen to form nanoscale Ni particles, which are segregated by La2O3. Liu [21] suggested that La2O3 can prevent transition metals from agglomeration and promote the dispersion of nanoscale Ni0 particles, resulting in an enhancement of catalytic activity and stability. After reaction the catalysts showed similar patterns with the results of Zhang and Verykios [22] and Nam et al. [23]. The La2O3 phase that existed in the reduced catalysts disappeared, the La2O2CO3 phase was formed due to the adsorption of CO2 on La2O3 (CO2 +La2O3 →La2O2CO3). The La2O2CO3 phase that existed in the used La2NiO4 catalyst is mainly hexagonal. Ni0 particles were not observed, thus, Ni0 particles might be present in an amorphous form or they are highly dispersed. Zhang and Verykios have noted that the carbon species formed on the Ni sites were easily removed by the oxygen species originating from La2O2CO3 (La2O2CO3 +C*→La2O3 +2CO+*) and thus produces an active and stable catalyst due to the existence of synergetic sites which consist of Ni and La elements. As indicated in this experiment, La2O2CO3 may play a crucial role in the POM using La containing catalyst prepared from perovskite precursors. The TG/DTG curves for the La2NiO4 catalyst after POM at 800°C for 80h are shown in Fig. 8 . The DTG curve of the used catalyst distinctly indicates a weight loss due to the removal of carbon. Three DTG features were observed at 363, 513 and 700°C. This indicates that at least three kinds of carbon deposition were formed on the La2NiO4. One of the carbon depositions is likely attributed to La2O2CO3, which had been verified by XRD. La2O2CO3, formed by the interaction of La2O3 with CO2, may decompose into CO and produce oxygen species, which react with the surface carbon species on the Ni sites, thus giving active and stable catalytic performance for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. This has been confirmed by Tsipouriari and Verykios [18]. 4 Conclusion A series of La2NiO4 catalysts were prepared by a citric acid complexation method, and their catalytic performance for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas were evaluated. The result showed that better catalytic performances can be achieved using the perovskite La2NiO4 as catalysts precursor. Among the catalysts tested, the catalyst La2NiO4 prepared with La:Ni:CA=2:1:3 and calcined at 850°C exhibits the best activity with excellent stability. The XRD results confirmed that La2NiO4 exhibited a typical spinel structure. During the POM, the active Ni0 particles did not aggregate and sinter, and the catalyst showed good stability within an on-stream time of 80h.
