Zenkl and F. Stelzer* Christian Doppler Laboratorium fur katalytische Polymerisation am Institut fur Chemische Technologie organischer Stoffe der Technischen Universitat Graz, Stremayrgasse 16, A-8010 Graz (Austria) Abstract 7-Oxa-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (exo,exo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester) was polymerized by ring-opening methathesis polymerization (ROMP) using various ruthenium catalysts and various aqueous solvents. The influence of solvent on induction time, molecular weight and yield of the product polymer is discussed. Norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene), regarded as quite unreactive in aqueous solvents until now, gave copolymers with this oxa-monomer in good yield. Introduction The ring-opening methathesis polymerization (ROMP) of strained cyclic olefins is one of the most attractive methods for synthesizing unsaturated polymers. Metathesis polymers are potential precursors for the synthesis of conjugated polymers [1]. The incorporation of functional groups into hydrocarbon polymers presents an opportunity to modify the chemical and physical properties of the respective polymer. For a considerable time unsaturation was the only functionality, because classical and modern ROMP catalyst systems are often very sensitive to oxygen, moisture and monomers containing functional groups, such as esters, alcohols and amides. However, Re2O,-A1203-based catalyst systems have successfully been applied to metathesis and co-metathesis of unsaturated esters derived from fatty oils [2]. Some early metal catalyst systems that use aluminium alkyl co-catalysts show rate enhancement with added water or alcohol, but only by a small amount. Recently Novak and Grubbs [3] found that selected group VIII coordination complexes, especially ruthenium complexes, polymerize derivatives of 7-oxanorbornene in methanol in the presence of water. Even in pure water, the polymerization could be carried out to obtain high-molecular-weight polymer in high *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

Norbornene and its derivatives are not easily polymerized with Ru salts in aqueous solution, because the monomers are only poorly soluble in water. Even if a surfactant is added, the polymerization proceeds slowly and with low yields [5]. This situation changes when a preformed catalyst complex between Ru and an appropriate 7-oxanorbornene compound, together with detergent, is used. We looked for solvents that would counterbalance the effects caused by the detergent. One of our aims was to find solvent mixtures in which both the catalyst and the monomer are soluble. Mixtures of water with various organic solvents exhibit this property. In this paper we report on the homopolymerization of exo,exo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (I) and its copolymerization with bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (II) (norbornene) in highly polar solvents such as water and aqueous ethanol, acetone, dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran. The reaction pathways are given in eqns. (1) and (2). The catalysts used were KZ[RuC15-H20] and Ru(III) hexaaqua complexes. 0 COOCH3 O n //~ /COOCH CH300C COOCH 0 COOCH3, 0 n ff jCOOCH3 + m x 25t) CH300CCOOGH3 (2) In contrast to RuC13, which is known to contain impurities with Ru in various oxidation states [6], KZ[RuCl,-H20] is a well-defined compound but is insoluble in most organic solvents. We circumvented this problem by mixing organic solvents with water. Polymerizations using Ru-salt catalysts are sometimes preceded by a lengthy induction period. To minimize this initiation time in a reproducible way was another aim of our investigation. Experimental Chemicals Laboratory-grade reagents and solvents (Fluka, Merck) were used as supplied. KZ[RuC15-H20] was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. 3 Catalyst synthesis Ru(H20)6(tos)3-3H20 (tos =p-toluenesulfonate) was prepared via the modified route described by. Bernhard et al. [7, 8]. Ru02 (aq.) oxidation with NaI04 under argon gave Ru04, which was dissolved in H,SiF6 solution and reduced with metallic Pb. After elimination of Pb as PbS04 the pink Ru(II)(H20), solution was oxidized with air, resulting in a deep yellow Ru(III)(H20)6 solution. Ion exchange was accomplished using Amberlite 120 instead of Dowex 80 with 2.2 mol L-l toluenesulfonic acid as the eluent. Concentration and crystallization, followed by washing with ethyl acetate, yielded yellow crystals. Stronger bonding of Ru(III) and the use of a different resin are probably the reasons for the very low yield (5 /a) of solid Ru(H,O)s(tos)3-3H2O. Monomer synthesis Exo,exo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethylester (I) was obtained by esterification of the Diels-Alder adduct of furan and maleic anhydride [9] with methanol and sulfuric acid [10]. Exo,exo-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (50 g) was boiled for 10 h with a mixture of 107 ml methanol and 1 ml conc. sulfuric acid (65% S03), then cooled, and the precipitated diester was separated. Recrystallization from methanol yielded pure white leaflets (35 g, 56%). 1H NMR (CDC13, 60 MHz, external TMS standard): 6.23 (1H, s), 5.00 (1H, s), 3.46 (3H, s), 2.66 (1H, s) ppm. Polymerizations Homopolymerizations of I in various solvents In general, the polymerizations were performed by dissolving the monomer in a mixture of water and an organic solvent at 50 C and adding a fresh solution of catalyst in distilled water. Some reactions were carried out under argon. The temperature was maintained at 50 C. In all cases colour changes occurred, giving a yellow solution. A change to a green colour was interpreted as deactivation of the ruthenium by chelation. Depending on the solvent, the resulting polymer remained in solution or precipitated during the polymerization. The polymer, poly(3,4-bis(carbomethoxy)tetrahydrofur-2,5-ylenevinylene), hereafter poly(I), was recovered by centrifugation (if the polymerization was carried out in solution, the polymer was first precipitated by addition of methanol) and thoroughly washed with water and ethanol. If some catalyst (coloured polymer) and/or monomer (determined by NMR) remained, the polymer was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and reprecipitated in distilled water. Recycling studies were carried out by subsequently adding monomer to the used and centrifugated catalyst solution without adding any further solvent. It was found that recycling of the 4 active catalyst solution is possible within a fixed overall reaction time, typically 2-4 days. Copolymerization of I with norbornene H 308 mg (1.45 mmol) I and 300 mg (3.19 mmol) II were dissolved in 7 ml acetone and 1 ml distilled water. To the resulting clear and colourless solution K2[RuCl,-H20] (25 mg) in 0.3 ml distilled water was added. The reaction tube was placed in an oil bath at 50 C. The polymerization was performed under 1 atm air. After an initiation time of 20 min, polymer precipitated from the yellow solution. After 3.25 h the polymer was isolated by centrifugation under air, washed with acetone and water, dissolved in THF and reprecipitated in distilled water. The white polymer (poly(IIa)) was then dried under vacuum, yielding 413 mg. To the active catalyst solution another portion of 301 mg (3.20 mmol) III was added. The clear yellow solution was then heated to 50 C, and polymer precipitated within a few minutes. After a reaction time of 15 h the polymer was recovered and reprecipitated as mentioned above to yield 203 mg of white polymer (poly(IIb)). Polymer characterization NMR spectra were recorded on a Hitachi- Perkin Elmer spectrometer operating at 60 MHz (external TMS standard) or on a Bruker MS-300 FT spectrometer operating at 300 MHz (proton) with CDC13 as the solvent. Resonances were referenced to residual solvent. All \"C NMR spectra were broad-band decoupled. Molecular weights of the polymers were assessed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in tetrahydrofuran. The equipment consisted of a Perkin Elmer pump (LC10), three 30 cm PL gel columns (10 p, 105 A; 5 p, 1000 A, 5p, 100 A) (Polymer Laboratories), refractive index and UV detectors in series, and a Linseis recorder. Molecular weights are referred to polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories). IR spectra were recorded on a Bomem Michelson 100 FT-IR instrument. Films were cast from solution on NaCl disks. Thermal characterization was carried out using a Perkin Elmer DSC-4/TADS instrument. Results and discussion Variation of solvent and catalyst For industrial applications, the use of inexpensive solvents that are not harmful to the environment and the possibility of recycling the noble metal catalyst are desirable in ring opening metathesis polymerization. For our experiments we therefore chose catalyst systems based on Ru salts and Ru complexes. As shown by Novak [5], these systems work well in the homopolymerization of 7-oxanorbornenes in aqueous solution or 5 alcohol/water mixtures. Norbornene had been polymerized only in suspension with the help of an emulsifying agent using a recycled catalyst solution after a primary polymerization of a 7-oxanorbornene. Until now it had not been ascertained whether the 7-oxanorbornene compound was incorporated into the final polymer. Our goal was to find more versatile reaction conditions and catalyst systems. As the 7-oxa-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (I) seemed to fulfill some of the requirements for a good initiating monomer (inexpensive and uncomplicated synthesis of a well-defined, highly pure product, easy handling due to good environmental stability, partial solubility in water and organic solvents, well-resolved signals with high sensitivity in NMR analyses of copolymers) we decided to use this monomer for ROMP reactions according to eons. (1) and (2) with various catalysts and solvents. The results are summarized in Table 1. The choice of catalyst was influenced by previous investigations showing that Ru-based catalysts are more active in ROMP than those based on Os or Ir [4]. This led us to the use of KZ[RuC1s-H20] because of its commercial availability and its well-defined oxidation state, in contrast to RuCl3-xH20. Novak proposed a Ru(lI) 7-oxanorbornene complex as the active catalyst species, because of the very short induction period of TABLE 1 Polymerization of monomer I in various aqueous solvents at 50 C Solvent Solvent ratio Catalyst M PDI Yielda water KZ[RuC15-H201 -b - 99 water [Ru(H20) j(tos)3 -b - 96 ethanol/water 11/5 K2[RuC15-H201 291000 1.89 99 ethanol/water 11/3 [Ru(H20)sj(tos)3 282 000 1.50 76 first cycle [Ru(olefin)jd 329000 1.42 38c second cycle' [Ru(olefin)jd 385000 1.38 10 acetone/water 5/4 K2[RuC15-H201 314000 1.59 92 dimethylformamide/water 1/1 first fraction' K2[RuC15.H201 422000 1.41 42 second fraction' [Ru(olefin)jd 412000 1.41 24 tetrahydrofuran/water 5/1 K,[RuC15-H201 163000 2.06 82 dimethylsulfoxide/water 1/1 KZ[RuC15-H201 - - 0 'The reaction was monitored until no further polymer was formed.

'The same batch, but different reaction times (1 and 12 h). 6 [Ru(II)(H20)s](tos)2 and exo,exo-5,6-bis(methoxymethyl)-7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]kept-2-ene, characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy [3]. We used [Ru(III)(HZO)6](tos)3 under air and found, surprisingly, that the reaction proceeds as quickly as with the Ru(II) complex. The initiation period was virtually the same as that for the very active monomer (I). From this we hypothesize that the same labile Ru(aqua/olefin) complex forms in both cases and are conducting NMR investigations to study the active catalyst species. Various solvent mixtures were used, none of which exhibited catalyst degradation or deactivation, except for dimethylsulfoxide, in which a stable Ru complex inactive for ROMP was formed. During most polymerizations the polymer precipitated from solution and could easily be separated by centrifugation or filtration. In aqueous THF the polymer stayed in solution, giving a large increase in the viscosity. Generally, in precipitation polymerizations, very high molecular weights were obtained, with polydispersity indices (PDI) ranging from 1.38 to 1.89. When carried out as a solution polymerization in THF, the molecular weight was much lower, while the PDI increased to 2.06. In the case of dimethylformamide/water the polymerization proceeded slowly and two fractions were separated after various reaction times. The polydispersities of both fractions were equal, and the molecular weights varied only slightly (within the measurement error; see Table 1). This indicates that the ROMP of monomer I with K2[RuC15-H20] was not a living one. However, the active catalyst solution was reusable. Further recycling studies were carried out with [Ru(IIl)(H20)6](tos)3 in ethanol/water, as described in Experimental. The molecular weight increased slightly in subsequent polymerization runs. The same catalyst solution was used 3 times, whereas the yield of polymer dropped with subsequent recycling (for comparisons see Table 1). NMR investigations of the polymer after recycling showed that the cis content increased with subsequent recycling. This could be due to slow hydrolysis of the monomeric ester and deactivation of the catalyst by chelation (irreversible formation of a ruthenium- dicarboxylic acid complex [11]). Therefore, polymerizations are sensitive to free carboxylic acids or the corresponding anions. Throughout, no free carboxylic acid protons were detected in the polymer by 1H NMR. If the same solution was used once more (run 4, after 3 days), in contrast to runs 1-3 the polymer obtained was not soluble in THF (Mn determination by GPC was not possible) but was soluble in THF/chloroform or dichloromethane. This indicated that no crosslinking had occurred and that either a high-molecular-weight polymer or a supramolecular structure had been formed. In pure water the reaction yield was virtually 100%, but again the polymer afforded was not soluble in THF, making molecular weight 7 determination impossible. Only trans double bonds were detected by NMR. For further recycling studies the use of other non-hydrolysable (giving free carboxylic acids) but water-soluble 7-oxanorbornene derivatives (ethers, ketones, etc.) should be better, but these have the disadvantages of overlapping NMR signals. Water acted in all cases as an activator or co-catalyst. If water was excluded the polymerization failed completely, or proceeded with a low conversion. We hypothesize that the water is necessary to exchange with some of the chloro ligands and build up the labile Ru-aquo complexes, and not only to solubilize the KZ[RuC15-H20] salt. Poly(I) can easily be hydrolysed in alkaline aqueous solutions to give the polymeric dialkali salt. Acidification of these solutions yields the colourless poly(diacid) in pure form, without impurities derived from the catalyst. This is an improvement over the polymerization of 7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride in water using RuCl3, which yielded the poly(diacid) contaminated with substantial amounts of Ru [4]. Polymer microstructure Homopolymer, poly(I) Microstructural analysis was made with reference to the homocyclic analogues, the poly(norbornenes) [12, 13] and published spectra of poly(tetrahydrofurylene vinylenes) [5, 14]. The monomer (I) used in this work is symmetrical and therefore cannot give rise to HH, TT or HT addition modes, but there are several different ways in which the repeating unit can be incorporated into the polymer chain. The double bonds may be cis or trans, and the allylic methines on either side of the double bond are chiral and may have opposite chirality, giving meso (m dyads, isotactic polymer) compounds, or the same chirality, giving racemic (r dyads, syndiotactic polymer) compounds. There are four possible dyads and microstructures and a variety of triad, tetrad, etc., microstructures. The numbering of atoms in the repeating unit of the polymer used in interpretation of the NMR spectra is given in Fig. 1. The 'H NMR spectrum of poly(I) using KZ[RuC15-Hz0] as the initiator in ethanol/water solution is shown in Fig. 2. The vinylic protons (6 and 7) resonate at 5.89 ppm (trans) and 5.59 ppm (cis).

The allylic protons at positions 2 and 5 resonate at 5.06 ppm (cis) and 4.68 ppm (trans). The methine protons adjacent to a trans double bond show no splitting or fine structure, while those adjacent to a cis double bond show a broad shoulder at 5.11 ppm. The methyl ester protons, 10 and 11, are observed at 3.68 ppm. Finally, methine protons at positions 3 and 4 resonate together at 3.08 ppm. The cis/trans ratio can easily be calculated by the integration of the vinylic or allylic protons. This ratio was found to be 1.19, giving a cis content 6, of 0.54. The Q, value exhibits strong dependence on the solvent mixture and the number of reaction cycles (e.g., in ethanol/water the cis content increased on subsequent recycling). During the aqueous polymerization (first run) no observable hydrolysis of the polymeric ester occurred. This can be seen by integrating the methyl ester protons and comparing them with the allylic protons (ratio = 3/1). In addition, no carboxylic acid protons were observed above 9 ppm. The 13C NMR spectrum of the same polymer is displayed in Fig. 3. The carbonyl carbons, 8 and 9, resonate as a multiplet centered at 171 ppm (cis,trans). The cis vinyl carbons resonate at 132.83 and 132.49 ppm and the trans vinyl carbons appear as a multiplet, with the main resonance at 131.40 ppm. This splitting may be due to cis/trans effects and/or tacticity effects. Allylic carbons at positions 2 and 5 resonate at 80.83 ppm (multiplet) if they are adjacent to a trans double bond and at 77.55 ppm if they are adjacent to a cis double bond. However, this peak cannot easily be resolved, owing to solvent (CDC13) peak overlap.

Spectral parameters are listed in Table 2. All signals of the homopolymers poly(I) and polynorbornene occur in the spectrum of the copolymer. This must be due to blocky sequences of both homopolymers (triads, tetrads, etc.). Additional resonances are seen at 5.80 ppm (quartet) and 5.45 ppm (multiplet), which can be assigned to the vinylic protons adjacent to both rings derived through ROMP of monomers I and II. These results indicate that the copolymerization leads neither to an alternating nor to a diblock copolymer, but rather that monomer I is incorporated almost statistically. To measure the molar ratio of the incorporated monomer units in the bulk polymer, clearly resolved and representative peaks were integrated. The methyl ester protons of monomer I are very sensitive to chemical changes (6 equivalent protons at 3.68 ppm) and do not overlap with other peaks. This makes an accurate determination possible. Resonances characteristic for the norbornene content occur at 2.78 and 2.44 ppm (allylic protons). Analysing the peak areas, we find that the copolymer consists of 26% monomer I and 74% norbornene with 68% trans content. This ratio agrees well with the feed ratio 31% I and 69% II, although the yield of copolymer is only 68% by weight. The used catalyst solution derived from the first copolymerization of monomers I and II still contained the very active preformed Ru(olefin) complex with the oxanorbornene. To this solution (under air) another portion of monomer II was added (second run). Within a few minutes polymer precipitated from the yellow solution. This was in contrast to the long initiation time (29 min) in the first run. This initiation time behavior is typical of aqueous ROMP Ru catalysis.

In the 'H NMR spectrum of the resulting polymer all resonances assigned to poly(I) homopolymer in the vinylic region can be seen, indicating that some short sequences (dyads, triads, etc.) are still present in spite of the small amount of monomer I in this copolymer. Comparison with the spectrum in Fig. 5 demonstrated that 8 mol% of monomer I was incorporated in the polynorbornene matrix. This quantitative determination of the I content was possible only by integrating the methyl protons peaks; all other signals stemming from I were too weak for integration or overlapped with strong polynorbornene signals. 77% of the polynorbornene double bonds were trans. From the two polymers with different I contents we were able to assign the resonances originating from the linkage between the norbornene and the oxanorbornene units. The multiplet centered at 5.80 ppm was assigned to the vinylic protons a and b (see Fig. 4) with a trans configuration of the double bond, and the multiplet at 5.45 to the cis configuration. The allylic protons of the monomer I units are also sensitive to these linkages and show additional splitting. The 13C NMR spectrum of the same polymer is displayed in Fig. 6. A general assignment can be made on the basis of the known spectra of the homopolymers. In every region of the spectrum there are peaks that do not appear in the spectra of the homopolymers. The resonances derived from the polynorbornene portion were extracted from the spectrum and agree well with \"C NMR data given in [ 17]. Investigation of the molar mass distribution by means of gel permeation chromatography of the copolymers showed only one peak, indicating that a real copolymer - and not two separated homopolymers - had been formed. This is in agreement with NMR studies. _ _ _ tfi0 120 80 LO 0 pp m Fig. 6. '3C NMR spectrum of the copolymer poly(IIa) from monomer I and monomer II in acetone/water with KZ[RuC15~H20] at 50 C (*indicates solvent). 12 Infrared absorption analysis In Fig. 7 we present the IR spectra of poly(I), poly(II) and copolymers. In the homopolymer of I, plot (a), the vinylic C-H stretching frequency appears at 3003 cm-1 and the saturated C-H stretching frequencies range from 2954 to 2849 cm-1. The absorption at 2849 cm-1 is characteristic of -0-CH, groups derived from the methyl ester. The spectrum displays the expected carbonyl absorption at 1739 cm-1. The C-H out-of-plane bending mode associated with cis vinylene units is evident at 733 cm-1. The shoulder at 965-970 cm-1 has been assigned to the trans double bonds. The IR spectra of the two copolymers with different I contents are displayed in plots (b) and (c). The characteristic carbonyl absorptions of the ester groups at 1739 cm-1 indicate the incorporation of monomer I into the polynorbornene matrix. For comparison, the IR spectrum of polynorbornene polymerized with MO(CH-t-Bu)(NAr)(O-t-Bu)z as the initiator is displayed in plot (d). IR spectroscopy is only a qualitative tool for determining the incorporated monomer I content, but in this case it is very sensitive, owing to the high absorption coefficient of the carbonyl group. Thermal properties The thermal properties of the polymers were studied by DSC. Degradation of the homopolymer poly(I) occurred with a reasonable rate starting at about 300 C.

IR spectra of (a) poly(I), (b) and (c) copolymers with different monomer I contents (see text), and (d) poly(II) on NaCI. 13 The Tg value of polynorbornene (see ref. [18]) was observed in both copolymers, indicating that at least the polynorbornene portion exhibits segregated domains. Conclusion 7-Oxa-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has been polymerized through ROMP with Kz[RuC15-H20] or Ru(H20)6(tos)3-3H20 in water alone or in mixtures of water with ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, to yield high-molecular-weight polymers. The polymerization can be carried out as precipitation or solution polymerization, depending on the solvents used. The diester I is a good and inexpensive candidate for forming Ru complexes active as initiators in aqueous ROMP. With a preformed catalyst solution even nonpolar monomers such as norbornene can easily be polymerized in nontoxic aqueous acetone mixtures without using inert gas and surfactants. The resulting copolymers are neither diblock nor alternating polymers. Recycling of the active catalyst solution was possible, but limited. The cis/trans ratio, polydispersity and average molar weight were influenced by the choice of cosolvent. The use of aqueous solvent mixtures may broaden applications of ROMP.
