DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60378-1 ARTICLE Effects of Partial Substitution of Ni by Cu in LaNiO 3 Perovskite Catalyst for Dry Methane Reforming G.R. MORADI*, F. KHOSRAVIAN, M. RAHMANZADEH Catalyst Research Center, Chemical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah 67149-67346, Iran Abstract: A series of ternary perovskite type oxides LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) were synthesized via the sol-gel method in propionic acid. Partial substitution of Ni by Cu showed higher activities and selectivities towards syngas products. LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 was the most active toward the CH 4 and CO 2 conversions, and was selective for syngas products. Temperature-programmed reduction results showed that the addition of Cu facilitates the reduction of Ni 3+ to Ni 0 , which is the main reason for the higher performance of this catalyst. Key words: dry reforming of methane; perovskite; lanthanun; nickel; sol-gel method Dry reforming of methane has attracted many academic and industrial researchers as it produces synthesis gas with a low H 2 /CO ratio while converting two major greenhouse gases to valuable products [14]. For dry reforming, noble metals are known to be active and stable catalysts and the order of activity for these metals and nickel are Ru > Rh > Ni ~ Ir > Pt > Pd. Despite the high activities and low sensitivities to carbon de- posits of the noble metals, costs and limited availability of these metals discourage their widespread industrial applica- tions. Ni is more promising since Ni-based catalysts are rela- tively inexpensive [5,6]. Nickel is more susceptible to coking and deactivates more rapidly than noble metals so many studies have been done to reduce this issue. Dispersing the active metal on a high surface area support along with the use of promoters, improves the stability and activity of the catalyst. The better dispersed the metal, the higher the catalytic activity [7,8]. Efforts have been made to synthesize Ni catalysts resistant to carbon deposition by introducing the metal into perovskite type oxides (ABO 3 ). These are well defined structures which can produce very small metal particles after reduction, with the metal well dispersed at the surface of a basic support. This small particle size helps avoid carbon formation and increases the activity and stability of the catalyst. Another advantage of the perovskite type structure is the possibility of total or partial substitution of its cations, modifying their oxidation state, mobility within the oxygen lattice, and the redox properties that can modify the catalytic activity and stability [912]. Partial substitution at the A site can strongly affect the catalytic activ- ity through stabilization of unusual oxidation states at the B site and the simultaneous formation of structural defects. Interac- tions created by the formation of bonds between Ni oxide and rare earth elements, increase in the reduction temperature of nickel oxide. However, particularly for LaNiO 3 , the thermal stability of the perovskite is low in a reducing atmosphere and coke formation can be important [13]. Thermodynamic calcu- lations of graphitic carbon deposition suggest that carbon formation can be avoided by working at high temperatures (e.g., 1000 Â°C) as well as using an excess of CO 2 , H 2 O, or O 2 . Also, coke formation can be suppressed by the addition of alkaline earth metals with high basicity. There are some published articles reporting improved activ- ity, selectivity, and stability of LaNiO 3 in the dry reforming of methane by adding basic or noble promoters for Ni substitution such as in LaNi 1-x M x O 3 (where M = Co [12], Mg [11,14], Rh [15], Ru [8,16], Fe [13], Al [17]). The presence of cobalt en- hances in situ formation of Ni 0 -Co 0 particles highly dispersed on the La 2 O 2 CO 3 matrix that inhibits coke formation in spite of the severe reaction conditions. These perovskite-type oxides (LaNi 1-x Co x O 3 ) produce very active catalysts when x 0.8 [12]. A small portion of Mg substituted into a perovskite, also de- G. R. MORADI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 797â€“801 creases the amount of coke produced during the reaction. Par- tial substitution of nickel by rhodium (5% mol, LaNi 0.95 Rh 0.5 O 3 ) increases the catalytic activity. Characterization of the solids reveal the complete decomposition of the perovskite type structure after reduction with the formation of metallic species such as Ni and Rh, and the presence of a considerable amount of La 2 O 2 CO 3 . The presence of rhodium not only modifies the catalyst surface but also improves the catalytic performance by enhancing nickel reduction and dispersion [15]. The partial replacement of nickel by ruthenium in the perovskite structure makes the metal reduction more difficult due to the stronger RuOLa bond as compared with the Ni?OLa bond. The most promising catalyst was the partially substituted perovskite LaNi 0.8 Ru 0.2 O 3 which, in spite of being less active than the other samples, showed the highest resistance to carbon depo- sition [8]. The partial substitution of Ni by Fe in the perovskite structure, LaNi 1-x Fe x O 3 decreased the rate of conversion of both reactants. However, the stability of the catalyst during the reaction was much increased [13]. Also, the addition of alu- minum to LaNiO 3 resulted in an efficient catalyst in steam and the dry reforming of methane and generated a change in the temperature of nickel reduction and stabilized the structure under reaction conditions [17]. In this work, Cu was chosen for partial substitution of Ni in LaNiO 3 perovskite. There is not any comprehensive study on the effects on catalysis of Cu substitution into a LaNiO 3 perovskite in the literature. Therefore, a series of LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 perovskites were synthesized by a sol-gel method and were used as catalyst precursors in dry methane reformation. 1 Experimental 1.1 Synthesis of perovskite-type oxides The ternary oxides LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) were synthesized by a sol-gel method in propionic acid. These were then used as catalyst precursors in the dry re- forming of methane to syngas. In the synthesis, La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O, Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3H 2 O, and propi- onic acid (C 3 H 6 O 2 ) were used. All reagents were purchased from Merck. The initial sources of each metal were individu- ally dissolved in additional hot propionic acid until the solution was clear at reflux. These salts were lightly warmed on a metal sheet with constant agitation until the dissolution of the solids was achieved. After complete dissolution, the solutions were mixed and agitated constantly for about 4 h at reflux. The propionic acid was then evaporated by increasing the tem- perature of metal sheet above the boiling point of the solvent, forming a resin, which hardened on cooling. The resulting gel was dried at 120 Â°C for 2448 h, ground to a fine powder and then calcined at 750 Â°C for 4 h. Catalysts were calcined by increasing the temperature from ambient to 750 Â°C at a rate of 3 Â°C/min and maintained at that temperature for 4 h in order to obtain the perovskite phases with the same order of crystallin- ity [12]. The calcined precursors were grounded to a fine powder and used as fresh catalysts in dry reforming reaction. 1.2 Catalytic activity The experiments were carried out with a feed composition of CH 4 :CO 2 :He = 1:1:1 and a total flow of 30 ml/min. All gases used were special purity grade (> 99.9999%). An appropriate mixture of reactants was injected through a mass flow con- troller (MFC, Brooks 5850 TR series) to a fixed bed quartz tubular micro reactor which was 50 cm long and had an inner diameter of 5 mm, containing 0.01 g of sample. The samples were diluted with quartz particles with a mesh size between 30 and 60. The reactor was imbedded in an insulated electric furnace, equipped with a programmable temperature controller. The sample was fixed by two layers of quartz wool at the center of reactor to prevent the catalyst from moving and to reduce the free volume. The exhausted gas stream entered a condenser to remove water before entering a gas chromatograph. Exhaust gases were analyzed using a thermal conductivity detector. The catalytic properties have been evaluated in terms of CH 4 and CO 2 conversions, H 2 and CO yields, and H 2 /CO ratio, as fol- lows: X(CH 4 ) = (n in (CH 4 ) n out (CH 4 ))/n in (CH 4 )) Ã— 100% (1) X(CO 2 ) = (n in (CO 2 ) n out (CO 2 ))/n in (CO 2 )) Ã— 100% (2) Y(CO) = n(CO)/(n in (CH 4 )) + n in (CO 2 )) Ã— 100% (3) Y(H 2 ) = n(H 2 )/2n in (CH 4 ) Ã— 100% (4) 2 /CO = n out (H 2 )/n out (CO) (5) A schematic view of the dry reforming setup is shown in reference [18]. Each experiment took about 20 h to produce the active catalyst. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 750 Â°C at a rate of 14.5 Â°C/min, and maintained at this temperature for the desired reaction time. In all ex- periments the perovskite catalyst was used without previous reduction. The stability of the catalysts was measured at 750 Â°C for 20 h. 1.3 Catalyst Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed to determine the internal structure of the synthesized solids, using a SIEMENS D5000 equipment with a copper anode (K Cu, 0.15406 nm), operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. Phase rec- ognition was obtained by comparison with JCPDS files. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts were carried out in a stream of 5.1% H 2 balanced with Ar at a flow rate of 50 ml/min using a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705 instrument. A catalyst sample (20 mg) placed in a quartz tube was degassed for 2 h at 120 Â°C under a N 2 stream, and then cooled to room temperature. Afte r the stream was switched from N 2 to the reducing gas, the sample was heated linearly at a rate of 5 Â°C/min. The water G. R. MORADI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 797â€“801 which formed during the reduction was trapped by cooling in a mixture of ethylene glycol and liquid nitrogen. The hydrogen concentration in the effluent was continuously monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic activity To find the effects of partial substitution of Cu for Ni in the LaNiO 3 perovskite structure and its optimum value, the ternary oxides LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 were prepared with different degrees of substitution with x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 and tested in the micro-reactor. The results of the catalytic tests for LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 series are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) shows the methane conversion of the LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 series perovskites. This value is greater than that of perovskite LaNiO 3 when x 0.6. Among this series, LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 showed the greatest increase in the conversion of methane. CO 2 conversion of LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 series perovskites is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Again, when x 0.6, this value is greater than that of LaNiO 3 (x = 0.0). For the partially substituted perovskites LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 where x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, the CH 4 and CO 2 conversions are close to the parent LaNiO 3 , changing by ~4%. For x > 0.6, these con- versions decrease intensely to the values lower than 30%. Figure 1(c) illustrates the H 2 /CO ratio of the LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 series. For x 0.6, this value is similar to that of the parent LaNiO 3 . For x 0.8, this value decreases to between 0.5 and 0.7. Among this series, LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 showed the greatest conversions of CH 4 and CO 2 reactants. Comparing the con- versions of CH 4 and CO 2 shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b), CO 2 conversion is uniformly higher than CH 4 . This occurs because of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (Equation 6), which is thermodynamically possible at these temperatures, and consumes CO 2 , occurs simultaneously with the CO 2 ref- ormation of CH 4 . For this reason, the H 2 /CO ratio attained is less than unity. 2 + CO 2 CO + H 2 O (6) 2.2 XRD results Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of perovskite-type oxide LaNiO 3 after calcination and after on-stream operation. As seen in Fig. 2(1), the main diffraction peaks of the calcined perovskite can be attributed to the perovskite structure. The diffraction patterns of the activated LaNiO 3 (Fig. 2(b)) are completely different from the patterns after calcination. It is obvious that after activation of this sample, the perovskite phase is lost to form two new phases which correspond to lanthanum oxide (La 2 O 3 ) and nickel (Ni). Focusing on the 2 between 32Â° and 35Â°, which correspond to the more intense diffraction of LaNiO 3 , shows a split characteristic of rhombo- hedra symmetry. The position of the peak of maximum inten- sity of LaNiO 3 was located at 33.168Â°. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of perovskite-type oxide LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 after calcination and after on-stream operation. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 13579113151719 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 M e t h a n e c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) LaNiO 3 LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 LaNi 0.6 Cu 0.4 O 3 LaNi 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3 LaNi 0.2 Cu 0.8 O 3 LaCuO 3 (a) C O 2 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) LaNiO 3 LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 LaNi 0.6 Cu 0.4 O 3 LaNi 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3 LaNi 0.2 Cu 0.8 O 3 LaCuO 3 (b) H 2 / C O r a t i o Time on stream (h) LaNiO 3 LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 LaNi 0.6 Cu 0.4 O 3 LaNi 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3 LaNi 0.2 Cu 0.8 O 3 LaCuO 3 (c) Fig. 1.

XRD patterns for perovskite LaNiO 3 after calcination (1) and after on-stream operation (2) [10]. G. R. MORADI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 797â€“801 In Fig. 3(1), the main diffraction peaks appear at 23.13Â°, 32.77Â°, 33.9Â°, 47.27Â°, and 58.67Â°, characteristic of the LaNiO 3 rhom- bohedra structure (JCPDF 33-711) that confirms the presence of a perovskite-type structure. Comparing with the XRD pat- tern of the perovskite LaNiO 3 , a progressive shift of the most intensive diffraction peak to lower angles is observed when nickel is partially substituted by copper (x = 0.2), accompanied of a small increase in its intensity. This shift indicates that a solid solution of LaNiO 3 is formed. Characterization of the after reaction catalyst used in the dry reforming of methane shows that the structure is completely different from that of the calcined counterpart (Fig. 3(2)). After on-stream operation, the perovskite phase is again lost to form two new phases which correspond to La 2 O 3 and Ni. The XRD pattern shows the main diffraction peaks at 29.97Â°, 39.51Â°, 46.08Â°, 52.13Â°, and 55.44Â° characteristic of La 2 O 3 hexagonal structure (JCPDF 5-602) and main diffraction peaks at 44.12Â° and 51.37Â° characteristic of the Ni cubic structure (JCPDF 3-1043). This La 2 O 3 phase has been claimed to be responsible for removal of carbonaceous material developed at the interface with the Ni 0 crystallites. Figure 3(3) shows the XRD pattern of the perovskite-type oxide LaNi 0.2 Cu 0.8 O 3 after calcination. In this pattern, the par- tial substitution of nickel by copper at x = 0.8, gives rise to two new phases which correspond to CuO and La 2 CuO 4 , as well as the original perovskite LaNiO 3 . The main diffraction peaks at 24.31Â°, 31.16Â°, 43.49Â°, and 47.66Â° are characteristic of La 2 CuO 4 face-centered orthorhombic structure (JCPDF 38-709). Peaks at 32.75Â°, 33.21Â°, and 58.1Â° are characteristic of LaNiO 3 rhombohedra structure (JCPDF 33-711), and peaks at 35.56Â°, 38.71Â°, and 65.24Â° are characteristic of the CuO monoclinic structure (JCPDF 5-661). By applying the Scherrer?s equation to the most intense dif- fraction peaks in the XRD patterns, the average crystallite sizes in the calcined and activated samples were calculated. The main crystalline phases and the average crystallite sizes of the precursors LaNiO 3 (calcined), LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 (calcined and after the activation process), and LaNi 0.2 Cu 0.8 O 3 (calcined) are shown in Table 1. The crystallite sizes of the calcined samples are on the order of 20-62 nm. As the substitution increases, the mean particle size of calcined perovskites increases. For the perovskite LaNiO 3 , the mean particle sizes for cal- cined sample and the sample after activation are similar, indi- cating that no sintering of the metal particles occurs during activation process [10]. For LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 the mean particle size after the activation process is greater than after calcination. It is possible that the sintering of the metal particles has oc- curred during this process. For the calcined samples, the mean particle size increases as the substitution degree increases. 2.3 TPR results Figure 4(1) displays the TPR profile of the perovskite LaNiO 3 . LaNiO 3 shows two main reduction peaks: the first peak at 390 Â°C is assigned to the reduction of the Ni 3+ to Ni 2+ with concomitant formation of La 2 Ni 2 O 5 ; another reduction at 522 Â°C is due to the reduction of Ni 2+ species in the brown- millerite phase to Ni 0 and La 2 O 3 in agreement with XRD pat- terns as suggested by Valderrama et al. [10] and Martinez et al. [19]. The resulting Ni 0 metal particles, which are the active phase in the dry methane reformation, remain highly dispersed on the lanthanum oxide phase (Ni 0 /La 2 O 3 ). A third smaller broad H 2 component overlaps the first main peak and extends over 350370 Â°C was also observed. If LaNiO 3 is the only phase present the intensity of the second peak should be twice 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 CuO La 2 O 3 Ni La 2 CuO 4 LaNiO 3 I n t e n s i t y 2? /( o ) (1) (2) (3) Fig. 3.

MORADI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 797â€“801 the first peak, however, the observed 1.41 value suggests that a small amount of a separate NiO phase is also present (NiO Ni 0 ). Based on these results, the reduction steps are written as follows: 2LaNiO 3 + H 2 La 2 Ni 2 O 5 + H 2 O (7) La 2 Ni 2 O 5 + 2H 2 La 2 O 3 + 2Ni + 2H 2 O (8) It was reported that the propionic acid synthesis method favors reduction of the solids at lower temperatures. According to some reports [10], the XRD patterns that do not show the formation of an alloy between nickel and added promoter to the perovskite structure have highly disperse metals. No alloy formation was observed in our XRD patterns, implying the metal is highly disperse. Figure 4(2) displays the TPR profile of the perovskite LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 . Two reduction peaks can be observed. The first peak at 365 Â°C shows a shift of ~25 Â°C to lower temperatures, compared with the LaNiO 3 perovskite. The second reduction peak at 510 Â°C shows a smaller shift of 12 Â°C to lower tem- peratures again compared with the LaNiO 3 perovskite. Thus the Cu 2+ reduces to Cu 0 at lower temperatures than either Ni 3+ or Ni 2+ , and the Cu 0 crystallites favor the reduction of nickel cations. A similar behavior was observed by Rivas et al. [15] for the LaNi 0.95 Rh 0.05 O 3 perovskite-type oxide. Comparing Figs. 6(1) and (2), the area under the first re- duction peak of the perovskite LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 is greater than that of the perovskite LaNiO 3 . It is possible that NiO and La 2 O 3 were formed, as well as the LaNiO 3 perovskite. This NiO can be reduced to Ni 0 simultaneously with the formation of La 2 Ni 2 O 5 , resulting in hydrogen consumption larger than the expected. The lower ratio of the area under the second peak area compared with the first indicates the amount of com- pounds other than the perovskite structure that were not ob- served by XRD and contribute to hydrogen consumption. 3 Conclusions After partial substitution of Ni in the LaNiO 3 perovskite structure by Cu, perovskites exhibit high conversions of CH 4 and CO 2 reactants and high yields of H 2 and CO products. In the LaNi 1-x Cu x O 3 perovskite series for x 0.6, the partial sub- stituted perovskites were found to be highly active toward the production of valuable syngas product during the dry refor- mation of methane. Among these perovskites, LaNi 0.8 Cu 0.2 O 3 , was the most active. Characterization of the catalysts revealed the complete decomposition of the perovskite-type structure after the activation process and the high activities are attributed to the in situ formation of metallic species including Ni 0 and Cu 0 which highly dispersed on a La 2 O 3 matrix. Cu 2+ reduces to Cu 0 at lower temperatures than either Ni 3+ or Ni 2+ , and the generated Cu 0 crystallites favor the reduction of nickel cations. The stability of the prepared catalysts is due to the presence of the La 2 O 3 phase. References 1 Subramani V, Gangwal S K. Energy Fules, 2008, 22: 814 2 Xu J K, Zhou W, Wang J H, Li Zh J, Ma J X.

Partial substitution of Ni by Cu showed higher activities and selectivities towards syngas products. LaNi0.8Cu0.2O3 was the most active toward the CH4 and CO2 conversions, and was selective for syngas products. Temperature-programmed reduction results showed that the addition of Cu facilitates the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni0, which is the main reason for the higher performance of this catalyst.
