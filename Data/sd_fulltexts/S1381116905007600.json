Graphical abstract αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 have been investigated as catalysts for the gas phase oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to cyclohexene with the addition of acetic acid (HOAc) in the feeds. αI-VOPO4 phase catalyst gives better catalytic performances than αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 in presence of acetic acid due to its higher acidity. αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 have been investigated as catalysts for the gas phase oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexane to cyclohexene with the addition of acetic acid (HOAc) in the feeds in a fixed bed reactor. Different VOPO4 phases showed different acidity and reducibility. β-VOPO4 phase is more active than αI-VOPO4 and αII-VOPO4 in the ODH without acetic acid addition. In the presence of acetic acid, the acidity of the catalyst may play an important role in the ODH process. Due to higher acidity, αI-VOPO4 phase catalyst gives better catalytic performances than αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 for the ODH of cyclohexane by adding of acetic acid in the reactants. Keywords αI, αII, β-VOPO4 catalysts Oxidative dehydrogenation Cyclohexane Cyclohexene Acetic acid 1 Introduction Catalytic selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cycloalkane has been the subject of many studies due to the importance of refining and reforming process in the petroleum industry, but there are very few practical processes for converting alkanes directly to more valuable products [1,2]. As the aimed products transformed from alkanes are usually relatively active than consequent alkanes, therefore, it is hard to control the high conversion of alkanes with high selectivity of alkene simultaneously [3]. Cyclohexene is one of chemicals of considerable industrial importance which is a valuable intermediate for producing cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, epoxycyclohexane, adipic acid, the precursors for nylon-6,6 and nylon-6 [4–6]. Cyclohexene obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane has been reported by using vanadate, molybdena and zeolite catalysts [7–10]. However, obtaining a high selectivity of cyclohexene from the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is difficult owing to the deep dehydrogenation to benzene which is thermodynamically much more favorable [11]. In previous study, we reported a new route to control the product selectivity in gas phase catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and cyclohexene over vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalyst with the addition of acetic acid (HOAc) in the feed [12]. VPO is an active catalyst well known in the vapor phase oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride (MA) [13,14]. Vanadium phosphorous oxide catalysts have also been widely investigated for the partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of others lower hydrocarbons [15–20]. V5+ species play an important role in abstracting H-atom from alkanes [21,22]. However, vanadyl phosphate phases (VOPO4 V5+) have been received less attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Lisi et al. detailed reported the correlation between physical–chemical properties and catalytic activity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethene in the use of vanadyl phosphate and vanadyl phosphate supported on oxides (TiO2, γ-Al2O3 and SiO2) as catalysts [23–26]. Various VOPO4 (V5+) crystalline structures reveal the different reactivity. αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 phases have similar structure with VOPO4·2H2O, each equatorial oxygen of VO6 sharing a corner of one PO4, with vanadyl chains running in the perpendicular direction, but the oxygen of PO4 being shared with the VO6 is different, which lead to the different catalytic activity [14,27]. Here the effect of different VOPO4 (V5+) catalysts (i.e. αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4) on gas phase-oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to cyclohexene with the addition of acetic acid (HOAc) in the feeds is reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Different VPO phases were prepared from the two precursors VOPO4·2H2O and NH4(VO2)2PO4·VOPO4·2H2O was prepared by long-term boiling of V2O5 in aqueous phosphoric acids as previously described [28]. NH4(VO2)2PO4 was obtained by adding 85% H3PO4 to a solution of NH4VO3 according to reference [29]. αI-VOPO4 was obtained by calcining the precursor, VOPO4·2H2O, at 500°C for 8h under air atmosphere and αII-VOPO4 catalyst was prepared as above but calcined at 750°C for 17h. β-VOPO4 catalyst was obtained by the decomposition of NH4(VO2)2PO4 in dry air with a heating rate of 1.25°Cmin−1 and kept temperature at 600°C for 10h [29,30]. 2.2 Characterization of catalysts X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the catalysts were obtained with a D/Max-IIB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Co.) at room temperature. Ni-filtered, Cu Kα radiation was used. Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) were carried out using a GC102 gas chromatography equipped with TCD as a detector. In TPD experiments the sample (0.1000g) was saturated with pure ammonia at room temperature for 1h, after purging with pure He for 3h, it was heated to 500°C at constant rate (10°Cmin−1) in flowing He (50cm3 min−1). Before saturating with pure ammonia the samples were treated in flowing helium (40cm3 min−1) at 400°C for 1h in order to clean up the adsorbed water. In TPR experiments, the sample (0.0250g) was reduced with a 5%H2/N2 mixture (25cm3 min−1) by heating to 650°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. BET surface areas were measured by N2 adsorption at 77K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. 2.3 Catalytic procedure ODH of cyclohexane reactions were preformed in a fixed-bed reactor made of quartz glass tube of 6mm inner diameter operated isothermally at atmospheric pressure. 0.20g of the VPO catalysts (40–80mesh) was adopted in the test and cyclohexane was fed at a flow rate of 9.25×10−3 molh−1 by means of a micro-perfusion pump. Acetic acid was also fed at a different flow rate by means of another micro-perfusion pump. The flow rate of air was maintained at 40cm3 min−1 by a mass flow controller for all experiments. The system was allowed to stabilize for 60min before the first product sample was taken for analysis. The product stream at reactor exit was collected in a liquid nitrogen trap. Blank test showed that the reactor was inert with respect to cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation in the temperature range investigated. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography employing a β,β′-oxydipropionitrile column for cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexidene and benzene separation, XE-60 column (13.5m×0.25mm) for maleic anhydride equipped with flame ionization detector and porapak Q column for HOAc with TCD. N2, O2, CO x were separated by β,β′-oxydipropionitrile and 5A molecular-sieve column with TCD. Mole conversion of cyclohexane is defined as [(M 0 − M i)/(M 0)]×100%, where M 0 is the initial number of moles of cyclohexane feeding to the reactor per unit time and M i is the number of moles of cyclohexane exiting from the reactor. Mole selectivity in terms of products C6 is calculated by [( M C 6 )/(M 0 − M i)]×100%, where M C 6 is the number of moles of individual C6 compound in the product (C6 indicate cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene or benzene). The carbon balance was measured within a ±5% error. 3 Results 3.1 H2-TPR results Results of hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments carried out on α1-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples are reported in Fig. 1 . αI-VOPO4 sample gives rise to a single, almost symmetric peak with maximum temperature at 615°C, and a small undistinguishable shoulder peak by the left of the main reduction peak. Both of H2-TPR of αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples show two reduced peaks, at 550 and 622°C for β-VOPO4, at 571 and 615°C for αII-VOPO4. 3.2 NH3-TPD results The surface acidity of the different VPO phase catalysts has been measured by ammonia adsorption. Fig. 2 shows the NH3-TPD curves of αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts and the relevant amounts of desorbed NH3. Two peaks are recognizable for the NH3-TPD curves of every VPO sample. A well-defined peak, with maximum temperature at 172, 216 and 159°C was arisen from αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4, respectively, and another shoulder peak at about 335°C for all samples. 3.3 Catalytic test results Catalytic reaction of cyclohexane with air over αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts only dehydrogenation and/or deeply oxidation products were obtained in the temperature range 400°C≤ T ≤500°C, but no cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone were observed. The product distribution of oxidation of cyclohexane with air over αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts at 400°C was shown in Table 1 . Benzene is the major product under the reaction conditions. No trace of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene was detected at 400°C, although the conversion of cyclohexane is very low for all VPO catalysts (only 6.4% for αI-VOPO4, 6.9% for αII-VOPO4 and 7.3% for β-VOPO4). β-VOPO4 shows slight higher activity than αII-VOPO4 and αI-VOPO4 catalysts, but lower selectivity (76.5%). Comparing with αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts, αI-VOPO4 catalyst is much more favorable to obtain oxidative dehydrogenation products than deep oxidation products. The ODH results of cyclohexane were shown in Tables 2–4 over αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts at 450°C, respectively. All catalysts show a further increasing in activity towards deep oxidation products, however, the relative sequence in selective benzene formation keeps unchanged. Therefore, the catalytic oxidative activity of cyclohexane over these three catalysts in the absence of HOAc is as follows: αI-VOPO4 <αII-VOPO4 <β-VOPO4. In order to reduce deep oxidation of cyclohexane, HOAc is added into reaction system as a reaction controlling agent. A new route to control product selectivity in cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation process has been put forward [12]. Tables 2–4 show the effect of HOAc on the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane over different VPO catalysts. After adding a certain amount of HOAc (the mole ratio of HOAc to cyclohexane is 2.4:1), the conversion of cyclohexane decreases and the products distribution is changed for all catalysts. It is noteworthy that the conversion of cyclohexane reduced significantly over αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts and more selective to benzene than that of αI-VOPO4 catalyst. Selectivity to cyclohexene increases and other products decrease with the increase of HOAc. Furthermore, a low level of unstable intermediates, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD), were simultaneously observed at the mole ratio of HOAc/cyclohexane about 5.3:1. Here, the selectivity of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene in Tables 2–4 as a whole denoted by cyclohexadienes. For αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 catalysts, almost 100% selectivity to cyclohexene was obtained when the mole ratio of HOAc to cyclohexane was 12.9:1, 10.3:1 and 7.7:1, respectively, at 450°C, correspondingly, conversion of cyclohexane was 6.9, 1.8 and 1.0%. These results indicate that the catalytic activity of ODH of cyclohexane on these three catalysts in the presence of HOAc is as follows: αI-VOPO4 >αII-VOPO4 >β-VOPO4. 4 Discussion It is well known that the performance of various vanadium phosphorus oxide catalysts is dependent on the following factors: surface area, redox-capability and surface acidity. In the present study, αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples have similar specific surface area: 6.42m2 g−1 for αI-VOPO4, 5.75m2 g−1 for αII-VOPO4 and 6.64m2 g−1 for β-VOPO4. The difference of catalytic performance among all VOPO4 catalysts cannot be attributed to the surface area. Redox properties of the catalysts play a key role in alkane oxidation over vanadium-based catalysts; the simultaneous presence of V4+ and V5+ species on the surface has been proved to be essential for the selective oxidation of butane over VPO catalyst [31]. In fact, VOPO4 compounds have the capability of reversible transition from one oxidation state to the others in the reaction process [32]. In general, starting from V5+ precursors, the layered αI-VOPO4 and αII-VOPO4 are more stable as compared to β-VOPO4 and their reduction leads to the formation of (VO)2P2O7 phase [27]. In other words, β-VOPO4 should have higher activity than α-VOPO4. The H2-TPR peaks of αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples shown in Fig. 1 can be recognized for reduction of crystal lattice oxygen species of VOPO4 catalysts. Both of αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 H2-TPR curves show two reduced peaks that indicate αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 each possesses two different kinds of reducible crystal lattice oxygen species. The first peak of β-VOPO4 denotes the reducing crystal lattice oxygen species of +5 oxidation state of vanadium to +4 oxidation state (in (VO)2P2O7) that is confirmed by XRD after the TPR experiment at 580°C, the second peak can be assigned to the formation of +3 oxidation state crystal lattice oxygen species of vanadium as reference described [23]. Compared with αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples, the H2-TPR profile of αI-VOPO4 shows a much more intense high-temperature peak, which denotes the existence of mainly more difficult reducible crystal lattice oxygen species. As shown in Fig. 1, the TPR curves of all VOPO4 samples indicate that the capability of reversible redox cycle between V5+ and V4+ for β-VOPO4 is easier than that of αII-VOPO4 and αI-VOPO4. This suggests that the catalytic activity should be in the order of: β-VOPO4 >αII-VOPO4 >αI-VOPO4. In the case of no HOAc addition, the activity of β-VOPO4 at reaction temperature 450°C is conformed to this agreement (Tables 2–4). At low temperature (400°C), the performance of the samples is also consistent with the relation between catalytic activity and redox property of the catalysts, although the conversion of cyclohexane is similar and low. However, in the presence of HOAc, the activity dramatically decreases with the amount of HOAc as in the order of: β-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4, αI-VOPO4. It is suggested that the redox ability of the catalysts has been changed by the addition of HOAc. It seems that original redox ability of the catalysts is not determinant factor for the ODH of cyclohexane in the presence of acetic acid. A basic factor determining the different catalytic performance of αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 samples seems to be changed into the surface acidity, which plays an important role in the presence of acetic acid. In our previous study indicated that acetic acid should be competitively adsorbed on the active sites of VPO catalyst, so that adjacent active sites for the deep oxidation are eliminated obviously. Thus, there are almost no adjacent active sites for the deep oxidation of reactants [12]. In other words, acetic acid competitively adsorbs on the unselective sites of VPO catalyst. The lower the acidity of VOPO4 compounds, the stronger the ability of active sites interacting with HO Ac will be. The results of the surface acidity show all VPO samples possess weak acid site. As known, NH3-TPD measurements do not give the information of acid type, but from literature data the low temperature peaks could be assigned to Lewis acid sites for VPO catalysts [33,34]. The amount of acid sites, very high for αI-VOPO4, and their order is as follows: αI-VOPO4 ≫αII-VOPO4 >β-VOPO4. As a result, the activity of β-VOPO4 and αII-VOPO4 catalyst dramatically decreases by adding small amount of HOAc. The better catalytic activity of αI-VOPO4 to cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation by adding HOAc in the feeds can be assigned to the presence of higher surface acidity which was evidenced by ammonia TPD measurements. 5 Conclusions Adding of acetic acid in the feed is a reliable method to control the activity of catalysts; therefore, high cyclohexene selectivity from ODH of cyclohexane over VPO catalysts can be realized. Different VOPO4 phases inherent different acidity and reducibility. β-VOPO4 phase is more active than αI-VOPO4, αII-VOPO4 in the absence of acetic acid addition. In the presence of acetic acid, the oxidation-reducibility of catalyst is changed; as a result that αI-VOPO4 phase catalyst gives better catalytic performances than αII-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 due to its higher acidity. The higher the acidity of VOPO4 compounds, the weaker the ability of active sites interacting with HOAc, which is one of the reason why the acidity of the catalyst plays an important role in the process.
