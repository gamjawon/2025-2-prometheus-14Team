Methanol production (CO* + 4H* → CHO* + 3H* → CH2O* + 3H* → CH3O*+ H* → CH3OH*) is highly favored by Ni1/W6S8 catalysts. In contrast, Co1/W6S8 catalysts strongly favor C2 hydrocarbons production. The rate constant of the step for the subsequent transformation of CH3O* species on the Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 was determined with the harmonic transition state theory (TST). The results of rate constant are in line with our kinetic results. Simultaneously, we use the d-band center to prove the correctness of the previous steps, the d-band center value of Co1/W6S8 is closer to EF than that of Ni1/W6S8; the result indicates that the catalytic activity of Co1/W6S8 is the best. The present study provides the basis to understand and develop novel M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni) single-atom catalysts for C2 hydrocarbons and methanol synthesis.

To decrease the dependence on crude oil and adhere to strict global environmental stipulations, the hydrogenation of CO is an extremely important reaction in quite a few contexts, and it has attracted considerable recent interest. The CO hydrogenation into clean fuels and value-added chemicals process can produce methanol and hydrocarbons in the Fischer-Tropsch (FT). Methanol is considered to be an important alternative fuel for future transportation needs, either for methanol fuel cells or for on-board generation of H2 for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells [3,4]. Methanol is attractive both as a feedstock for making commodity chemicals and as fuel additives. Because of wide varieties of sources, syngas has become increasingly popular as a valuable alternative feedstock for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals. Fischer-Tropsch (FTS), which generates hydrocarbons through CO and H2 becomes a mounting number of important route for the producing chemical feedstocks or motor fuels without the production of the environmentally harmful compounds [5–7]. In the past 70 years, although efforts have been made to find a reaction mechanism for determining FT synthesis [8,9], the final result has not been determined. Fischer and Tropsch firstly proposed the carbene mechanism, which starts with the direct dissociation of CO in atomic carbon and oxygen. Carbon atoms are subsequently hydrogenated to CHX species that then couple to hydrocarbon chains. Whereas, Choi and Liu [10] have found that CO hydrogenation to form formyl species (COH or CHO) is more plausible than the direct CO dissociation on the Rh(111) surface. Furthermore, on the flat Co(0001) surfaces, the carbide mechanism is not viable, and an alternative pathway with the hydrogenation of the adsorbed CO to CHO/CH2O followed by CO bond cleavage is preferred [11]. Additionally, they think that the most favorable monomer among all the CHx species is not consistent [12–14]. The studies by Kapur et al. [14] have shown that CO insertion into CH2 is deduced to be the precursor for C2 oxygenate formation on Rh(111) and Rh(211) surfaces. Interestingly, Zhao et al. [15] have shown that CHO insertion is superior and/or competitive to CO insertion for CC chain formation on Rh(111) and Co(0001) surfaces. Nie et al. [16] have found that CH* is the most favorable monomeric species for production of CH4 and C2H4 via CC coupling of two CH* species and subsequent hydrogenation. As a result, the mechanism and kinetics of CHx (x = 1–3) and CC chain formation are still many questions unanswered: (1) CHx (x = 1–3), formed by the hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation mechanism or the carbide mechanism? (2) What is the most favored CHx monomer? (3) Which way is more plausible for CC chain formation, CHi (i = 0–3)−C Hj (j = 0–3) coupling or CO/HCO insertion into CHx followed by CO bond scission? In order to resolve the issues above, in this study, the mechanisms of C2 hydrocarbons and methanol formation from CO hydrogenation on M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni) single-atom catalysts have been systematically investigated by using DFT calculations. In contrast to methanol synthesis based on Cu-based catalyst [17] or FTS of hydrocarbons by using Fe- or Co-based catalysts [18,19]. However, Co FTS catalysts exhibit higher activity, chain growth probability, stability, with lower water gas shift activity than Fe-FTS catalysts [6]. In comparison with previous results for other catalyst surfaces for CO hydrogenation, we find that between Cu and Co catalysts is Ni, which occupies a middle ground in terms of the favored production of methanol or methane [20]. Previous experimental studies have shown Ni to be an active catalyst for CO methanation [21,22], but theoretical studies have suggested that methanol production is a strong possibility on Ni surfaces as well [23,24]. Moreover, Wang et al. [25] studied the reaction mechanism of ethanol on model cobalt catalysts. And Liu et al. [26] have found that the Mo6S8 cluster is active for syngas conversion and is more selective for methanol formation. Moreover, the Mo and W belong to the same group VIB, and the structure of W6S8 same as the Mo6S8 is octahedron of Oh symmetry [27], so chemical properties of W6S8 are similar to Mo6S8. Co-Mo6S8 and Ni-Mo6S8 have been found active for methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 [28]. Consequently, our research reports for the first time that single M1 (M = Co and Ni) atoms anchored on W6S8 can be served as the highly effective catalyst for CO hydrogenation, with a focus on the competition between pathways leading to C2 hydrocarbons and methanol synthesis. 2 Computational details 2.1 DFT calculation methods All DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian09 program [29] with the B3LYP functional [30,31]. Some recent theoretical articles also used B3LYP functional [25,32]. The geometry of the intermediates was optimized at the B3LYP/6–31 g(d,p) level and their corresponding vibrational frequencies and single point energy calculation were computed at the same level. The 6–31 G(d,p) basis set was employed for the H, C, O and S, while the Co, Ni and W atoms were described with the LANL2DZ pseudopotentials basis set, and its core electrons are represented by the LANL2DZ effective core potential (ECP) [33]. The transition state search was performed with the linear and quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) complete search [34]. Meanwhile, we have calculated the harmonic vibrational frequencies to verify the nature of the corresponding stationary points (minima or transition state) to provide zero point vibrational energy (ZPE) and the thermodynamic contributions to the enthalpy and free energy. To confirm the transition states and their connected minima, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations [35] were performed to follow the reaction pathways.The rate-limiting step is given by the transition state of highest energy, relative to the intermediate at the beginning of the section [36,37]. The adsorption energies were calculated using the equation: (1) Eads = Eadsorbate-M1/W6S8 - Eadsorbate - EM1/W6S8 where Eads represents the adsorption energy of the adsorbate on M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni), Eadsorbate is the energy of free adsorbate, EM1/W6S8 is the energy of M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni) and Eadsorbate-M1/W6S8 is the energy of adsorbate-M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni) adsorption system. The reaction barrier (Eact) is defined as Eact = ETS - EIS and the reaction energy (Ereat) is defined as Ereat = EFS - EIS, where EIS, EFS, and ETS are the total energy of the initial, final, and transition states, respectively. 2.2 Harmonic transition state theory (TST) We applied the TST to predict the rate constants of the reactions. The rate constant k and pre-exponential factor A° were estimated using TST [38]: (2) k = k B T ℏ Q T S Q I S exp − E a R T = A 0 exp − E a 0 R T where kB is the Boltzmann constant; R is the gas constant; ℏ is Planck’s constant; T is the absolute temperature; Ea° and Ea are the energy barriers with and without zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections; QTS and QIS are the partition functions for the transition states and reactant of elementary reaction, respectively. According to Eq. (2), the first step in employing the TST is to compute the partition functions of reactants and transition states. These partition functions have the contributions of [39] translations (3) Q t = ( 2 Π k B T ) 3 / 2 V ℏ 3 rotations (4) Q r = 8 Π I a I b I c 2 Π k B T 3 / 2 σ ℏ 3 and vibrations (5) Q v = 1 1 − e − ℏ v / k B T Ia, Ib, and Ic are the moments of inertia of each species relative to axes a, b, and c, respectively; V is the total volume of each species; σ is the symmetry number; and ν is its frequency. In our paper, the partition functions (Q) of the TS and reactants obtained from the Gaussian09 output. 3 Results and discussion Octahedral molybdenum and tungsten clusters face-capped by chalcogens M6Q8 (M = Mo, W; QS, Se, Te) have drawn extensive attention because of the well-known molybdenumbased Chevrel phases [40]. The molecular W6S8L6 (MW, Mo; L = Lewis base ligand) clusters are available in experiment [41]. For the modified Mo6S8 (M-Mo6S8) system, M interacts with Mo6S8 via both S and Mo, and M atoms favor the hybrid Mo SSMo 4-fold site [28]. Similar situation is also observed for M1/W6S8 (M = Co and Ni), the W-S-S-W 4-fold hollow site is preferred by M (Table S1). In addition, our calculations show that Ni(Co) atom on the W6S8 has the lowest energy and is the most stable at the W-S-S-W 4-fold site. We also give the adsorption energy and bond length of the Ni(Co) atom on the W6S8 catalysts in Table S1 of the supporting information. 3.1 Adsorption of reactants and possible intermediates By our DFT calculations, the most stable configurations of reactants and possible intermediates are presented in Fig. S1. The preferred adsorption sites, key geometrical parameters and the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates involved in CO hydrogenation on Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 (Table S3). We will discuss mechanism on Co1/W6S8 here, and mechanism on Ni1/W6S8 are presented in the Supporting Information in detail. 3.2 The Dissociation and hydrogenation of CO For the CO* activation, the first possible step direct dissociation and hydrogenation of CO* have been taken into consideration (Fig. 1 a). The potential-energy profiles of CO* activation paths on the Co1/W6S8 surface are shown in Fig. 1b. CO* → C* + O* (R1) CO* + H* → COH* (R2) CO* + H* → HCO* (R3) For (R1), the CO bond breaking of CO* can dissociate into C* and O through transition state TS1. This reaction requires an activation barrier of 129.69 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of 99.19 kcal/mol. The CO distance is elongated to 2.929 Å from 1.145 Å in CO*. For CO* hydrogenation, there are two alternative products, one is COH* and the other is HCO*. In (R2), CO* hydrogenation to COH* via TS2 needs to overcome an activation barrier of 54.49 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of 17.78 kcal/mol. In TS2, OH distance is 1.259 Å and SH distance is 3.768 Å. For (R3), CO* hydrogenation to HCO* via TS3, this reaction proceeds with an activation barrier of 7.02 kcal/mol, and it is endothermic (Ereat = 5.15 kcal/mol). In TS3, CH distance is 2.047 Å and SH distance is 2.149 Å. Overall in this step, CHydrogenation of CO* is favored over CO bond breaking. It clearly shows that the activation barrier of CO* + H* → HCO* step is the smallest compared to CO direct dissociation and COH formation on both Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 (shown in Fig. S2 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the HCO formation is easier compared to that of CO direct dissociation or COH formation. It is reported that the activation barrier for CO bond cleavage is extremely reduced after H-assisted mechanism [42,43]. Meanwhile, CO hydrogenation to HCO* is more favorable on Co1/W6S8 than on Ni1/W6S8 because the higher activation barrier is required for the Ni1/W6S8 (Eact = 22.50 kcal/mol). The (R3) activation energy barrier on Co1/W6S8 than on Ni1/W6S8 is lower than the reported literature [44,45]. 3.3 CHx formation We carried out calculations for CHx formation (R4 − R13) based on the above mechanisms (Fig. 2 ) and the geometry of TS (Fig. S3). The potential energy diagram for these reactions is displayed in Fig. 3 . 3.3.1 CH formation (R4) HCO* + H* → CHOH* (R5) HCO* → CH* + O* (R6) HCO* + H* → CH2O* (R7) CHOH* → CH* + OH* In (R4), H* adatom associates with the O* atom of HCO* via TS4 to form CHOH*, and this reaction is endothermic by 6.73 kcal/mol with an activation barrier of 21.44 kcal/mol. In TS4, OH distance is 1.741 Å. CHOH* further dissociates its C–O bond on elongating the C–O distance to 2.846 Å in transition structure TS7, with a barrier of 24.46 kcal/mol, and forms products CH* and OH*, 1.00 kcal/mol exothermic (R7). For CH formation, in (R5), HCO* dissociates its C–O bond via an elongation of the C–O distance to 2.013 Å, on crossing transition structure TS5 with a reaction barrier of 23.68 kcal/mol, which is exothermic by 5.76 kcal/mol. For (R6), to form CH2O*, the coadsorbates, HCO* and H*, might proceed through an association of the H* atom and the C* atom of HCO* with a barrier of 4.25 kcal/mol, which is exothermic by 7.64 kcal/mol. In TS6, C–H distance is 2.149 Å. As shown in Fig. 3, the result demonstrates that further hydrogenation of HCO* to form either CHOH* or dissociates to form CH* and O* would not be favored; rather, HCO* can be more easily hydrogenated to CH2O* as the most thermodynamically and kinetically preferable step on both Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 (shown as the black line). 3.3.2 CH2 formation (R8) CH2O* + H* → CH2OH* (R9) CH2O* → CH2* + O* (R10) CH2O* + H* → CH3O* (R11) CH2OH* → CH2* + OH* In (R8), CH2O* is first hydrogenated to CH2OH* via TS8, and this reaction is exothermic by 18.40 kcal/mol with an activation barrier of 8.26 kcal/mol. In TS8, dO-H = 1.224 Å. CH2OH* further dissociates into CH2* and OH* via TS11 with an activation barrier of 23.01 kcal/mol, and it is exothermic by 7.08 kcal/mol (R11). In TS11, dC–O = 2.745 Å. For CH2 formation, in (R9), CH2O* dissociates its C–O bond via an elongation of the C–O distance to 1.296 Å, on crossing transition structure TS9 with a reaction barrier of 17.06 kcal/mol, which is exothermic by 17.84 kcal/mol. In (R10), CH2O* can undergo C–Hydrogenation to CH3O* through TS10 is exothermic by -43.43 kcal/mol with an activation barrier of 14.32 kcal/mol. In TS10, d C-H = 2.015 Å. Accordingly, CH3O* formation is more feasible than either direct dissociation into CH2* and O* or CH2OH* formation on both Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 (shown as the black line). 3.3.3 CH3 formation (R12) CH3O* → CH3* + O* (R13) CH3O* + H* → CH3OH* For CH3* formation on the Co1/W6S8, upon the CO bond cleavage of the CH3O* intermediate where CH3* is formed (R12, TS12), the reaction is exothermic (Ereat = −0.59 kcal/mol), which corresponds to an activation barrier of 8.91 kcal/mol. In (R13), CH3O* associates with a H* atom to form CH3OH* on crossing transition structure TS13, with a barrier of 21.62 kcal/mol, which is 11.71 kcal/mol endotherm. It is noteworthy that, CH3O* dissociates to form CH3* and O as the most thermodynamically and kinetically preferable path on the Co1/W6S8. However, on the Ni1/W6S8, CH3O* associates with a H* atom to form CH3OH* has the lowest energy barrier of 18.30 kcal/mol, which is lower by 51.78 kcal/mol than that CH3O* dissociation into CH3*. 3.3.4 CH4 formation (R14) CH* + H* → CH2* (R15) CH2* + H* → CH3* (R16) CH3* + H* → CH4* The potential energy profile of CH4 formation together with the geometry is shown in Fig. 4 . In (R14), CH* hydrogenation to CH2* via TS14 is exothermic by 49.02 kcal/mol, and it has an activation barrier of 1.78 kcal/mol. In (R15), CH2* hydrogenation to CH3* via TS15 requires an activation barrier of 3.96 kcal/mol, and it is exothermic by 35.78 kcal/mol. (R16) is exothermic by 20.94 kcal/mol and has a reaction barrier of 10.25 kcal/mol in TS16. (R16) is the rate-determining step for CH4* formation. On the basis of the above-mentioned results, we can summarize that the most favorable path for CO hydrogenation is CO* → HCO* → CH2O* → CH3O*. Thereby, CH* comes from direct HCO* dissociation. CH2* as well as CH3* come from CH* hydrogenation. 3.4 C-C chain formation 3.4.1 CO/HCO insertion into CHx (x=1–3) species In this section, the CO/HCO insertion into the CHx species at the bimetallic sites was investigated and summarized in Fig. 5 , and the corresponding structures of transition states are illustrated in Fig. S4. 3.4.1.1 CO insertion (R17) CH* + CO* → CHCO* (R18) CH2* + CO* → CH2CO* (R19) CH3* + CO* → CH3CO* In (R17), CO* insertion into CH* to CHCO* via TS17 has an activation barrier of 12.03 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -30.02 kcal/mol. In TS17, the CC bond length of 1.909 Å. In (R18), CO* insertion into CH2* to CH2CO* via TS18 has an activation barrier of 16.28 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -26.60 kcal/mol. In TS18, dC-C = 2.005 Å. In (R19), CO* insertion into CH3* to CH3CO* via TS19 has an activation barrier of 7.45 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -4.90 kcal/mol. In TS19, the CC distance is 1.800 Å. Comparing these three reactions, CO insertion into CH3 is kinetically favorable than CO insertion into CH and CH2. 3.4.1.2 HCO insertion (R20) CH* + HCO* → CHCHO* (R21) CH2* + HCO* → CH2CHO* (R22) CH3* + HCO* → CH3CHO* In (R20), HCO* insertion into CH* forms CHCHO* via TS20, this reaction is exothermic by 66.38 kcal/mol with an activation barrier of 3.34 kcal/mol. In TS20, the CC bond length of 2.457 Å. In (R21), HCO* insertion into CH2* to CH2CHO* via TS21 has an activation barrier of 13.04 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -28.76 kcal/mol. In TS21, the CC bond length of 2.063 Å. In (R22), HCO* insertion into CH3* forms CH3CHO* via TS22, this reaction is exothermic by 22.61 kcal/mol with an activation barrier of 2.41 kcal/mol. In TS22, dC-C = 2.084 Å. It can be seen from Fig. 5 and the Table S5 that the energy barrier of HCO* insertion into CHx (x = 1, 3) are all smaller than CO* insertion. In comparison with two insertion pathways, the results demonstrate that HCO* insertion into CHx (x = 1, 3) is more preferable than CO* insertion. In the previous study of Zhao et al. [15], HCO* insertion into CHx (x = 1–s3) exhibits comparative activity to CO* insertion, which is consistent with our results. The preference for HCO* insertion better than CO* insertion for CHx can be attributed to the superior activity of HCO* compared to CO*. As shown in Fig. 6 , compared with the CO, the HOMO level of the HCO moves upward and the LUMO level goes down. As a result, the smaller HOMO-LUMO gap of HCO compared to CO, which facilitates charge transfer and hybridization between HCO and the catalyst. 3.4.1.3 CHxC(H)O dissociation in C–O bond (R23) CHCO* → CHC* + O* (R24) CH2CO* → CH2C* + O* (R25) CH3CO* → CH3C* + O* (R26) CHCHO* → CHCH* + O* (R27) CH2CHO* → CH2CH* + O* We carried out the calculations of C–O bond scission for these elementary steps, (R23)-(R27) on Co1/W6S8 (Fig. 5). As listed in Table S2, CH3CHO* can desorb easily because of the low adsorption energies of 18.62 kcal/mol. In (R23), the CHCO* dissociation is a slightly exothermic process (6.54 kcal/mol) with a relatively high barrier of 51.24 kcal/mol. In TS23, C–O distance is 2.103 Å. For (R24), the C–O bond breaking of CH2CO* can dissociate into CH2C* and O* through transition state TS24. This reaction requires an activation barrier of 28.54 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -9.35 kcal/mol. In TS24, C–O distance is 2.067 Å. In (R25), the C–O bond breaking of CH3CO* can dissociate into CH3C* and O* via TS25 needs to overcome an activation barrier of 31.32 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of 7.96 kcal/mol. In TS25, C–O distance is 1.902 Å. In (R26), the CHCHO* dissociation is a slightly exothermic process (7.59 kcal/mol) with a relatively high barrier of 36.72 kcal/mol. In TS26, C–O distance is 2.108 Å. In (R27), the C–O bond breaking of CH2CHO* can dissociate into CH2CH* and O* via TS27 needs to overcome an activation barrier of 25.49 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of −7.46 kcal/mol. In TS27, C–O distance is 3.137 Å. In summary, the calculations suggest that both C–O bond cleavage in CHxC(H)O is not an energetically favorable process on Co1/W6S8. 3.4.2 CHx (x = 1–3) coupling with CHy (y = 1–3) (R28) CH* + CH* → CH−CH* (R29) CH* + CH2* → CH−CH2* (R30) CH* + CH3* → CH−CH3* (R31) CH2* + CH2* → CH2−CH2* (R32) CH2* + CH3* → CH2−CH3* (R33) CH3* + CH3* → CH3−CH3* CHx−CHy coupling reaction is also the alternative pathway for CC chain formation. Table S6 lists the reaction barriers, the reaction energy, and CC distances at transition structures of each CC coupling reaction; the IS, TS and FS geometry of CC coupling on Co1/W6S8 are given in Fig. 7 respectively. For the CH* species, CH* self-coupling to C2H2* is spontaneous. The reaction energy is −77.02 kcal/mol. CH* coupling with CH2* can form CHCH2*, which has the reaction energy of -42.36 kcal/mol with an activation energy barrier of 8.03 kcal/mol. In TS29, CC distance is 2.309 Å. CH* coupling with CH3* to give CHCH3* has the reaction energy of -33.05 kcal/mol with an activation energy barrier of 5.90 kcal/mol. In TS30, dC-C = 2.237 Å. CH2* self-coupling to C2H4* has the reaction energy of −57.04 kcal/mol with an activation energy barrier of 3.41 kcal/mol. In TS31, the CC bond length of 2.304 Å. CH2* coupling with CH3* to CH2CH3* intermediate has the reaction energy of −20.25 kcal/mol with an activation energy barrier of 12.24 kcal/mol. In TS32, CC distance is 2.158 Å. CH3* self-coupling to C2H6* via TS33 needs to overcome a lower activation barrier of 1.50 kcal/mol with the reaction energy of -30.62 kcal/mol. In TS33, CC distance is 2.806 Å. Our studies showed that CH* self-coupling to C2H2* is also the most feasible among all the CHx−CHy coupling reactions on the Co1/W6S8. 3.4.3 C–H bond formation (R34) CH−CH* + H* → CH−CH2* (R35) CH−CH2* + H* → CH−CH3* (R36) CH−CH2* + H* → CH2−CH2* (R37) CH2−CH2* + H* → CH2−CH3* (R38) CH−CH3* + H* → CH2−CH3* (R39) CH2−CH3* + H* → CH3−CH3* Therefore, we examined the reaction energetics for hydrogenation of CH−CH* to produce C2H4 and C2H6. Optimized structures of IS, TS and FS produced are shown in Fig. 8 , and reaction energetics, activation barriers, and CH distances (dCH) at the transition states are included in Table S7. The activation barrier for CH−CH* hydrogenation is 1.23 kcal/mol and further hydrogenation of CH−CH2* to form adsorbed CH−CH3* is spontaneous. But, CH−CH2* to form C2H4 requires to overcome a barrier of 4.39 kcal/mol, as listed in Table S7. The activation barriers for hydrogenation of CH2−CH2* and CH−CH3* to form CH2−CH3* on Co1/W6S8 are 4.16 kcal/mol and 1.15 kcal/mol, respectively. In (R39), the hydrogenation of CH2−CH3* to form C2H6* requires to overcome an energy barrier of 3.86 kcal/mol. The reaction energetics for C–H bond formation is exothermic. But (R36) is endothermic by 39.81 kcal/mol. Consequently, in CC chain formation is via CH* coupling with CH*. C2H4 is formed via CH + CH → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 2H* → CHCH2* + H* → C2H4; C2H6 is formed via CH* + CH* → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 4H* → CHCH2* + 3H* → CHCH3* + 2H* → CH2CH3* + H* → C2H6. 3.5 Summary of the subsequent transformation of CH species From the above-mentioned results, we can summarize the formation path as follows: CO* is first hydrogenated to produce HCO*, which then undergoes CO bond cleavage, leading to the formation of insertable monomers, CH* species. CH* is considered as the most favorable monomer for CC chain formation, which is consistent with the proposition suggested by Weststrate [46] and finding on the Co(0001) [47] surface. The potential energy diagram for the subsequent transformation of CH* species is shown in Fig. 9 . For the CH species, as shown in Fig. 9, CHO* insertion into CH* to give CHCHO* has a lower free energy barrier (1.78 kcal/mol) than CO* insertion into CH* to CHCO* (12.03 kcal/mol). Although CH* hydrogenation to CH2* has a low free energy barrier of 1.78 kcal/mol, the reaction CH* self-coupling to C2H2* is spontaneous. On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that CH* self-coupling to C2H2* is the most favorable among all the reactions related to CH* species. In Weststrate’ s work [46], the chain initiation undergoes via coupling with two CH* species, namely, C2H2 is the primary product of coupling. 3.6 Comparisons for C2 hydrocarbons and methanol formation between Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 Fig. 3 presents the potential energy profile of CH3 and CH3OH formations on both Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8, respectively. First, CO* + 3H* → CHO* + 2H* → CH2O* + H* → CH3O* is the common optimal pathway on Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8; Beginning with CH3O*, on Co1/W6S8, the activation barrier of CH3* and CH3OH* formations are 8.91 and 21.62 kcal/mol, respectively; whereas, on the Ni1/W6S8, the activation barrier of CH3* and CH3OH* formations are 51.78 and 18.30 kcal/mol. Thus, Fig. 3 presents the potential CH3O* dissociation to CH3* is energetically compatible with CH3O* hydrogenation to CH3OH* on Co1/W6S8, CH3OH* formation is more preferred in kinetics on Ni1/W6S8. 3.6.1 Comparison of the rate constant of the subsequent transformation of CH3O* species In this section, the rate constant of the step for the subsequent transformation of CH3O* species on the Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8 was determined with the harmonic transition state theory (TST). This kinetic modeling approach has been successfully applied to other reaction systems [48,49]. As shown in Table 1 , it is worthy to note that the rate constant of CH3* is larger than CH3OH* formation, which suggests that the CH3O* → CH3* + O* is the more favorable step on Co1/W6S8. In comparison, the rate constant of CH3OH* is larger than CH3* formation, which indicates that the CH3O* + H* → CH3OH* is the more favorable on Ni1/W6S8. The results of rate constant are in line with our kinetic results. Moreover, the rate constant for the formation of CH3* by CH3O* on Co1/W6S8 is larger than the rate constant for the formation of CH3OH* on Ni1/W6S8. 3.6.2 The rate constant of C2 hydrocarbons The rate constant of the step for the C2 hydrocarbons on the Co1/W6S8 was determined with the harmonic transition state theory (TST). On Co1/W6S8, CO* is hydrogenation to HCO* (CO* + H* → HCO*). Next, CH* comes from HCO* direct dissociation (HCO* → CH*+O*). C2H4 is formed via CH + CH → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 2H* → CHCH2* + H* → C2H4; C2H6 is formed via CH* + CH* → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 4H* → CHCH2* + 3H* → CHCH3* + 2H* → CH2CH3* + H* → C2H6. For C2H4 and C2H6 formation, HCO* dissociated into CH* and O* step is the rate-limiting step with a reaction barrier of 23.68 kcal/mol. As shown in Table S8, it is worthy to note that the rate constant of CH* formation is the smallest among all steps of C2H4 and C2H6, which suggests that the CHO* → CH* + O* the rate-limiting step for the C2H4 and C2H6 formation on Co1/W6S8. 3.6.3 Comparison of d-band center position with catalytic activity In order to make our results more accurate and reliable we will employ the Hammer-Nørskov model [50] is that determines the catalytic activity of Co1/W6S8 and Ni1/W6S8. The model has systematically studied which parameters influence the reactivity of metal surface. The model has systematically studied which parameters influence reactivity of the metal surface. It suggests that the molecular adsorption energy is dependent primarily on the occupancy of bonding and antibonding states formed by hybridization of the wave functions of adsorbate and metal’s d-state electrons. If the antibonding state lies below the Fermi level (EF), the interaction between adsorbate and metal surface becomes repulsive, thereby giving rise to a weak chemisorption. This situation can be well explained by the position of d-band center of the metal. The position of d-band center (εd) can be described by the energy of d-band center relative to EF. The position of εd moving towards EF affects the activity of catalyst and leads to a stronger chemisorption. As shown in Fig. 10 , the Co1/W6S8 adsorbs a CO molecule the d-center value is the highest and corresponds to -0.77 eV, which results to the strongest adsorption of CO on Co1/W6S8, predicting reaction of Co1/W6S8 with CO proceed easily. We can also find that Ni1/W6S8 has the more negative value of d-band center, -1.06 eV. The closer of the d-band center is from the Fermi level, which is more favorable for catalytic reactions. We get the following conclusions: the d-band center value of Co1/W6S8 is closer to EF than that of Ni1/W6S8; the result indicates that the catalytic activity of Co1/W6S8 is the best. We use the d-band center to prove the correctness of the previous steps. In the steps listed in the Table S9, the reaction energy barrier on the Co1/W6S8 is smaller than Ni1/W6S8. This further verifies the correctness of our computational reaction energy barrier. 4 Conclusions In this work, the formation mechanism of C2 hydrocarbons and methanol on M1/W6S8 single-atom catalysts have been systematically investigated, and the following conclusions are drawn. CH3OH* formation is (via CO* + 4H* → CHO* + 3H* → CH2O* + 3H* → CH3O*+ H* → CH3OH*) more preferred in kinetics on Ni1/W6S8. CO* hydrogenation to HCO* is the rate-determining step for the methanol synthesis with a reaction barrier of 22.50 kcal/mol. However, on Co1/W6S8, CO* is hydrogenation to HCO* (CO* + H* → HCO*). Next, CH* comes from HCO* direct dissociation (HCO* → CH*+O*). C2H4 is formed via CH + CH → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 2H* → CHCH2* + H* → C2H4; C2H6 is formed via CH* + CH* → C2H2*, then, C2H2* + 4H* → CHCH2* + 3H* → CHCH3* + 2H* → CH2CH3* + H* → C2H6. For C2H4 and C2H6 formation, HCO* dissociated into CH* and O* step is the rate-limiting step with a reaction barrier of 23.68 kcal/mol. Moreover, the rate constant for the formation of CH3* by CH3O* on Co1/W6S8 is larger than the rate constant for the formation of CH3OH* on Ni1/W6S8. The results of rate constant are in line with our kinetic results. Simultaneously, the d-band center value of Co1/W6S8 is closer to EF than that of Ni1/W6S8; the result indicates that the catalytic activity of Co1/W6S8 is the best. We believe that the insight derived from this study can be valuable for both the catalyst design of methanol synthesis and other C2 hydrocarbons related catalytic systems.
