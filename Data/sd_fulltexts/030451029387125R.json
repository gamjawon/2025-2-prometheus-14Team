Petit*, A. Katrib, P. Girard, F. Garin and G. Maire Laboratoire d Etude de la Reactiuite Catalytique, des Surfaces et des Interfaces (L.E.R.CS.Z) URA 1498, E.H.LC.S.,1 rue Blaise Pascal, 67008 Strasbourg (France) (Received September 10,1992; accepted July 20,1993 ) Abstract The catalytic behaviour of silica and alumina supported Pt-Mo catalysts has been studied in the isomerization of hydrogenolysis of hexane hydrocarbons. XPS analyses were performed to follow the different oxidation states of molybdenum alone, or with platinum under hydrogen or under argon bombardment. The XPS analysis showed that molybdenum interacts more strongly with alumina than with silica. As a result, two classes of catalysts were identified, depending on the presence of the reduced relatively mobile, state of molybdenum on the catalyst surface. At low molybdenum content, the catalytic behaviour is similar to the platinum catalysts. But when the molybdenum concentration is increased another type of behaviour emerges, linked to a dual activity between platinum and molybdenum. It has been observed that hydrocarbon structure has a strong influence on the catalyst selectivity. When no tertiary carbon atoms are present in the hydrocarbon, the cracking reactions occur very deeply. Only secondary and primary carbon atoms are involved in the degradation process. The isomerization reaction is only a bond shift reaction. Key words: alumina; hexanes; molybdenum; platinum; silica; skeletal rearrangements; surface structures Introduction The well known reforming Pt/A1203 catalysts have been progressively replaced by bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Re and Pt-Ir which are more active and resistant [ 1 ] . However, Re and Ir metals are rare and expensive, and it would be advantageous to replace them by other metals, like molybdenum or tungsten. A strong synergistic effect has been observed in the case of Pt-Mo/Si02 catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of ethane [2], butane [3] and the CO +HZ reaction [ 4 ] . G. Leclercq et al. [ 5 ] have studied the catalytic behaviour of this bimetallic catalyst for structurally sensitive or insensitive reactions.

Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 results were observed by using Pt-Mo deposited on zeolites [ 7-9 ] . The synergistic effect of these bimetallic Pt-Mo catalysts has been interpreted by Yermakov et al. [ 10 ] in terms of well dispersed platinum particles on the silica support, where both Pt and Mo are in contact with each other and where each metal plays an individual role, complementary to the other for the catalytic activity [4-9]. Although the Pt-Mo/A1203 system has been studied, its catalytic activity was not well understood. It has been reported that a strong interaction occurs between Mo and alumina [5,11]. In the present work we have studied the catalytic selectivity of Pt-Mo deposited on Si02 or A1203 for the isomerization reactions of hexanes. By using labelled 13C hexanes it has been possible to distinguish between the different reaction mechanisms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed in order to determine the nature of the interaction, if any, between Pt, Mo and the support. Experimental Catalyst preparation Silica and alumina support Pt-Mo catalysts were used in this study (Table 1). Except for Pt-Mo 38% /Si02, all the silica Pt-Mo catalysts corresponding to 3% Pt were prepared by G. Leclercq et al. [ 5 ] . High purity silica Aerosil 200 Degussa support (BET surface area 200 m2 g-1, average particle size 12 nm) was impregnated following the classical coimpregnation method using aqueous solutions of hexachloroplatinic acid (Johnson Matthey) and of ammonium heptamolybdate (Fluka). After evaporation, the solids were dried overnight in an oven at 383 K, then reduced under flowing hydrogen at 773 K. These Pt- TABLE 1 List of catalysts used Catalyst % eq.

C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 77 Mo catalysts were prepared with a constant metal atom content (Pt +Mo) of about 9 X 1019 metal atoms per gram of dried unreduced catalyst, which corresponds to about 2.9 equivalent wt.-% Pt with various proportions of Pt and Mo. These catalysts were designated PMD x where P refers to platinum, M to molybdenum, D to Degussa and x to the relative atomic percentage of molybdenum in the total metal content. The alumina supported Pt-Mo catalysts containing 3% and 10% equivalent of Pt (PMA 50) were prepared by the coimpregnation method under the same conditions. Woelm alumina was used with a specific area of 154 m2 g-1 and a 0.28% of pore volume. The alumina Pt-Mo (PMA) catalysts were prepared by successive impregnations as follows: - Alumina Ketjen CK 300B was used with a specific area of 217 m2 g-1, a pore volume of 0.62 cm' g-1 and a particle size of 200-500 nm. - The wet impregnation technique was carried out by first adding ammonium heptamolybdate. The solution was stirred and slowly evaporated and then hegachloroplatinic acid was added. After evaporation the catalyst was reduced at 773 K. These catalysts were designated: PMA 60 and 80. Reactants The unlabelled hydrocarbons were Fluka Puriss grade. The carbon-13 labelled hydrocarbons were prepared following the already published procedure [ 12 ] . Before each experiment the 13C-labelled reacting hydrocarbon was purified by gas liquid chromatography. Apparatus Catalytic reactions were carried out in a flow system working at atmospheric pressure where pH2/pHC =120. The total conversion was maintained below 15% so as to limit secondary reactions. In each run a fraction of the reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography over a 5-m X 1/8-in column of DC 200/fire-brick and, for location of the label in each isomeric product GLC-MS spectrometry is used with 13C hydrocarbons. The experimental procedure has already been described [ 13 ] . Under our experimental conditions the accuracy of the measurement of the mass spectra is limited only by the heights of the peaks, and the change of the total ion current is smaller than 0.3% for a group of 10 masses. The mass spectra of the various=isomers were recorded in the parent, demethylated and deethylated regions. After correction for the naturally occurring isotopes and the C-H fragmentation, the location of carbon-13 in the various molecules was determined by comparing the demethylated and deethylated mole fractions to the ones obtained for the various pure isotopic species. The XPS spectra were obtained by using an ESCA III, VG instrument with AIKa radiation. The charging effect was considered with great attention 78 C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 throughout this work [ 14 ] . All the spectral line binding energies were referred to Al (2p) at 74.6 eV in the case of Pt/A1203 and at 75.0 eV in the case of Mo/ A1203 on the basis of the Fermi levels of Pt and Mo, obtained in each case by in situ vapour deposition [ 14,15 ] . Similarly, it was found that Si (2p) was 102.8 eV in the case of Pt/Si02 and 103.6 eV in the case of Mo/Si02. All the reference values were taken into account in the case of Pt-Mo supported on alumina or silica depending on the nature of interaction, if any, between Pt and Mo. Catalytic results The overall catalytic activity, Va was expressed as the number of millimoles of hydrocarbons transformed per gram of catalyst per second. The following reactions were studied: (i) Hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane (MCP). The initial step in this reaction was the breaking of one C-C bond, leading to the formation of one saturated hexane such as 2-methylpentane (2MP), 3-methylpentane (3MP) and n-hexane (n-H). Secondary reactions may occur, such as cracking. (11) Isomerization of hexanes. This type of reaction occurs by chemical bond shift or cyclic mechanism as a result of intramolecular rearrangement. (iii) Hydrogenolysis of hexanes leads to cracked products. This type of reaction occurs as a result of either the dissociation of one C-C bond leading to the formation of products such as (C2, C4), (CS,CI) and 2C3, or of many CC bonds leading to the formation of light products such as 6C1 or 3C2. Hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane (MCP) The catalytic activity and selectivity at 523 K of this reaction performed on the Pt-Mo system which contains 3 equiv-% of Pt deposited on silica are reported in the Table 2, where results obtained on alumina supported catalyst are compared. Table 2 shows that the maximum hydrogenolysis activity was obtained in the case of Pt/Si02 (PMD 0) catalyst. A substantial decrease in this activity is observed in the catalyst containing molybdenum, PMD x, x > 38%. We may note also that the highest selectivity leading to isomer products is obtained in the case of PMD 0 catalyst. The ratios 2MP/n-H and 3MP/ n-H are equal to 1.1 and 0.4, respectively, for this platinum catalyst. These values are near the statistical ratio values of 1 and 0.5, respectively. This result shows, on this catalyst, a non-selective ring opening which has already been correlated with the presence of small metallic platinum particles [ 12,16 ] . A large increase in the amount of 2MP and a drastic decrease in n-hexane formation is observed in the case of PMD x with x > 38% as compared to PMD 0. C. Petit et al. / J. Mol.

Isomerization and hydrocracking of 2-methylpentane (2MP) The results of the 2-methylpentane isomerization reactions using different catalysts are reported in Table 3. The isomerization activity of PMD 14 is very close to the one obtained on PMD 0 catalyst. The catalytic activity decreases at higher molybdenum contents, PMD x with x> 38%. The largest amount of n-hexane is obtained on PMD 0 and PMD 14 catalysts. A substantial decrease, by a factor of 10, in the amount of n-hexane is obtained at higher molybdenum content. By contrast, the maximum amount of 3-methylpentane is obtained in the case of PMD 50. It is interesting to note that the ratio 3MP/ n-H increases as the molybdenum concentration increases. Concerning the hydrocracking reactions we can see (Table 3) that no extensive degradation of the starting molecule occurs (6C1= 3C2 = 0) . The selectivity in the carbon- 80 C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 carbon bond rupture shows that when molybdenum is present in relatively large quantity in the catalyst, the bond rupture in the demethylation process involving primary and secondary carbon atoms is favoured over the one involving primary and tertiary carbon atoms. These results are shown in the column iCb/C5, where the formation of iCs is favoured on PMD 50 and on PMD 38 and the iC5 and n-C5 are formed statistically on the PMD 0 and PMD 14. The same tendencies for 3MP/n-H ratio and iC6/nC6 ratio are observed with the alumina supported catalysts having higher concentrations of molybdenum. Isomerization and hydrocracking of 3-methylOntane (3MP) Table 4 shows that the activity for isomerization is similar for both PMD 0 and PMD 14 catalysts. This catalytic activity is 15 times higher than that observed in the case of the other PMD x with x > 38% catalysts. The maximum in n-hexane formation is obtained on PMD 0 and PMD 14 catalysts. A drastic decrease in n-hexane formation is observed in the case of PMD x > 38% catalysts. A maximum in 2-methylpentane formation is obtained in the case of catalyst PMD 75. However, the maximum 2MP/n-H ratio is obtained in the case of PMD 50 and its value is 30 times the value obtained on PMD 0. No extensive cracking reactions were observed. Concerning the selectivity in the carbon-carbon bond rupture we can see that n-pentane is formed in a lower amount than isopentane. The iCb/nC5 ratio is 10 times higher on PMD 50 than on PMD 0 or PMD 14. This indicates that the most probable carbon-carbon bond dissociation is between primary and secondary carbon atoms rather than between primary and tertiary carbon atoms. The alumina supported catalysts improve the isomerization activity as compared to PMD 75 catalyst. The 2MP/n-H ratio reaches a maximum on PMA 80 compared to PMD 50 and PMD 75. The same tendency is observed for isopentane formation, which is favoured compared to n-pentane formation.

Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 81 Isomerization and hydrocracking of n-hexane (n-H) The isomerization activity of n-hexane, at 523 K, is of the same order for both PMD 0 and PMD 14 catalysts (Table 5). This activity decreases considerably at higher molybdenum content. The 2MP/3MP ratio is nearly equal to 1. Concerning the selectivity, we can see in Table 5 that, except for PAM 0, the selectivity to hydrocarbons with six carbon atoms S (2MP + 3MP + MCP) % , presented as S% in Table 5, is low. On the other hand, no extensive cracking occurs with n-H, the internal carbon-carbon bonds ruptures are favoured (deethylation and depropylation) on PMD x, x > 14. The PMD 0 catalyst shows a statistical distribution. The isomerization activity, selectivity and the cracking product distribution of n-hexane using alumina supported catalyst is of the same tendency as those obtained using the PMD x, x > 38% catalysts. From the above results it is concluded that: The activities of the PMD 38, PMD 50 and PMD 75 catalysts are in the same range for all the hydrocarbon compounds studied in this work. However, in the case of the 2MP, 3MP and n-H on PMD 0 and PMD 14, the activities are similar and are 10 times higher than the other catalysts. Only in the case of MCP is the PMD 0 activity 20-30 times higher than all the other PMD x catalysts. By comparison with other hydrocarbons, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane, it is observed that the selectivities are strongly influenced by the hydrocarbon structure. It was found that the selectivity to hexanes for all the catalysts was around 90% in the case of MCP and higher than 30% for 2MP and 3MP. On the other hand, it was observed that only in the case of PMD 0 was the selectivity for n-H relatively high, while it is below 30% for all the other PMD x, x > 14 catalysts. The isomerization reaction mainly occurs via methyl shift, where the total number of carbon atoms in the principal chain is maintained throughout all the possible transformations. For example: 2MP gives 3MP and vice versa; 2,2-dimethylbutane gives 2,3-dOethylbutane and vice versa. However, in the case of n-H, only cracking reactions were observed.

Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 Chain lengthening (2MP or 3MP > n-H) or chain shortening (n-H > 2MP or 3MP) are not favoured processes. Isomerization of labelled hexanes To be able to quantify these mechanisms we have performed some reactions with 13C labelled hydrocarbons. The isomerization reaction of 2- (213C) methylpentane leading to labelled 3-methylpentanes has been selected at 523 K using the PMD 0, PMD 50 and PMD 60 catalysts (Fig. 1). The catalytic behaviour of the PMD 0 has been compared to a 2.5% Pt/A1203 catalyst already in use in our laboratory. If a metallic character will occur, two mechanisms may be expected in this case. (i) The cyclic mechanism, which needs an adsorbed methylcyclopentane to be formed as an intermediate species. (ii) The bond shift mechanism as a result of an alkyl group migration leading to the formation of isomers. If, for example, we look at the 3-methylpentane formation we may have the reactions shown in Fig. 1. It was useless to study the reactivity of 2- (4-13C) methylpentane and 3- (3- 10 '0~ a 2.(Z.t3C1 methypentnne 3-(3-13C) methypentane /~^ __. /*~ b 2-(2-13C) methypentane 3-(2-13C) methypentane Fig. 1.

These two types of reactions occur on alumina supported platinum catalysts [ 16 ] but, when the catalyst is modified by molybdenum, not only the metallic behaviour will occur but also some acidic character may appear, which means that the catalyst may behave as a bifunctional one. In that case most of the reactions will occur via a carbenium ion, as for example in the scheme of Mills et al. [ 17 ] . Then the analysis of the labelled isomers will not be straightforward and we have to take into account the various possibilities. It is interesting to note that almost the total (94.5%) isomerization reaction in the case of the PMD 50 occurs via the bond shift mechanism. A very close value of 87.0% is observed in the case of PMA 60 catalysts. These results are in agreement with the fact that 2MP reaction gives 3MP and the reverse and that n-H is not formed. At this point we have to consider that the bond shift is not similar to the one obtained on a metallic catalyst. XPS results The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the bimetallic Pt-Mo system deposited on alumina or silica is discussed in terms of Pt (4f), Cl(2p), Mo(3d) and the valence band energy regions. The unreduced Pt-MoJAt203 (PMA 50)10% equivalent Pt catalyst The XPS of freshly prepared Pt-Mo/A1203 (PMA 50) unreduced catalysts containing 10% equivalent Pt by the coimpregnation method mentioned previously shows the presence of a relatively broad and low intensity line at - 77.6 eV as compared to the intense, well-defined line of Al (2p) at 74.65 eV (Fig. 2a). Since the Pt (4f) spin-orbit components are located in this energy region and separated by 3.3 eV, we assign the line at 77.6 eV to the Pt (4fb/2) component, while the other Pt (4f.,/2) at 74.3 eV cannot be observed due to its overlap with the Al (2p) spectral line. The Pt (4f6/2) at 77.6 eV most probably corresponds to a Pt (II) C12 species observed previously as a result of the partial decomposition of PtC14 [ 15 ] . The two spectral lines at 198.3 and 199.4 eV shown in Fig. 3a are assigned to the Cl (2p) spin-orbit components. The Mo (3d) spin-orbit components are observed in the form of two broad lines at 233 and 236 eV (Fig. 4a). The broadening of these two lines as compared to those of the dried Mo salt [ 18 ] can be attributed to either the wetness of the surface or to a slight interaction of Mo with the alumina surface as a result of the decomposition of the Mo salt during impregnation on the alumina surface.

(a) Fresh sample; (b) after 45 a Ar+; (c) after 300 s Ar+. the Mo ( VI ) salt simultaneously is not excluded. The presence of Pt and Mo result in a considerable increase in the relative intensity and broadening of the low energy region of the valence band (Fig. 5a). The argon ion bombardment of the surface for a total of 45 s results in the appearance of a new line at 71.6 eV beside the Al ( 2p ) (Fig. 2b ) . A substantial decrease in the relative intensity of the Cl ( 2p ) at 199.2 eV is also observed (Fig. 3b). On the basis of the above results, it is concluded that the Pt(II)C12 species has been reduced by Ar+ bombardment to the almost metallic state (Pt (4f7/2) -71.1 eV). The slight increase of 0.5 eV in the Pt(4f) as compared to the elemental state is attributed to the presence of chlorine in relatively small amounts. The other Pt (4f6/2 ) component which is expected to be at 74.9 eV cannot be observed due to its overlap with the intense Al(2p) line.

Such a structure indicates the presence of more than one oxidation state as a result of the partial reduction of the Mo (VI) state of the initial sample. Also, the appearance of a relatively intense line at 2.4 eV in the valence band energy region can be observed (Fig. 5b), which can be attributed to the reduction of Pt as well as Mo on the alumina surface. Further Ar+ bombardment of the surface for the total of 300 s results in the relative increase in the binding energy of the Pt (4f7/2) at 72.4 eV (Fig. 2c) . A further decrease in the relative intensity of the CI (2p) at 199.3 eV can be observed (Fig. 3c ). This new state of Pt is attributed to a strong metal-support interaction in the form of Pt-O-Al induced by Ar+ bombardment [ 15 ] . The Mo (3d) spin-orbit components remain relatively broad, indicating the presence of more than one Mo oxidation state. The most intensive Mo (3d5/2) line at 233.5 eV is attributed to an Mo (VI) species which is bonded to the alumina 86 C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 Mo(3d) a c 235.00 240.00 Fig. 4.

The sputtering effect of the Ar+ bombardment which results in the removal of certain amounts of metal atoms from the catalyst surface can be observed through the considerable decrease in the relative intensity of the low energy side of the valence band (Fig. 5c) .

The XPS of the energy region between 70 and 80 eV shows the presence of one relatively symmetrical and intense line at 74.6 eV which is assigned to the Al (2p) (Fig. 6a). The presence of platinum on the catalyst surface, even in a small amount, should be observed in this energy region regardless of its oxidation state, as shown previously for the C. Petit et al. / J.

These lines are relatively broader than those of the unreduced Mo sample. Fine structure determination by deconvolution of this band shows the presence of another Mo ( VI ) oxide state shifted by 0.8 eV to higher binding energy than the bulk Mo03 structure. This state is attributed to an Mo ( VI ) species strongly interacting with the alumina surface through oxygen, and forma a stationary phase. The presence of such a state has been observed previously [ 19,20 ] . The other phase ( Mo ( 3d6/2 ) ) at 232.8 eV is not interacting with the surface. Further reduction of the catalyst surface by H2 gas at 773 K for 2 h in situ did not produce any significant change in the energies or the line shapes of the Al ( 2p ) , Mo ( 3d ) and the valence band energy regions (Figs. 6-8 (b ) ) . In order to obtain more information about the absence of Pt on the reduced PMA 50 catalyst, as revealed by XPS, we have C. Petit et al. / J. Mol.

(a) Initial sample; (b) after 45 s Ar+; (c) after 300 s Ar+. prepared a Pt (5%) /A1203 sample and reduced it following the same procedure as in the case of PMA 50. A relatively strong line at 71.8 eV was observed, which is attributed to the Pt (4f7/2) of the reduced platinum. These results seem to indicate that the Pt particles are covered by the stationary Mo phase rather than being diffused through the alumina support. The presence of metal (s) on the alumina surface can be observed by the relative increase in the intensity of the line at 6.3 eV in the valence band energy region (Fig. 8a). Argon ion bombardment of the surface for 300 s did not significantly modify the Al (2p) line B.E., where a shoulder at 71.9 eV might be present (Fig. 6c). A considerable decrease in the relative intensity and energy of the Mo(3d) spin-orbit components is observed (Fig. 7c), as well as in the low energy side of the valence band energy region (Fig. Sc). Argon ion bombardment can reduce the non- or slightly interacting Mo (VI) phase with the alumina to the Mo (IV) state. Such reduction is not possible in the case of strongly interacting Mo (VI) phase. The measured XPS results are given in Table 8.

These binding energies certainly correspond to the metallic state of platinum. However, the Mo (3d) energy region shows the presence of two partially resolved broad lines at 232.9 and 235.8 eV (Fig. l0a). Other values can also be observed at 229.2 and 230.1 eV in the low energy side. The two prominent lines at 232.9 and 235.8 eV are assigned to the Mo(VI) state, while the other two lines correspond to Mo oxidation states of Mo (IV) and may be Mo (V) . Although platinum remains in the metallic state, despite the exposure C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 a b 68.00 72.OA 91 76.00 Fig. 9.

(a) Initial sample; (b) reduction in situ at 773 K for 2 h; (c) after 300 a Ar+. of the catalyst to air for almost 1 h during the sample preparation for the XPS analysis, we find that Mo is oxidized to the higher Mo ( IV )-Mo ( VI) states. In fact, we have observed previously that the metallic Mo state obtained through Mo vapour deposition on a silica surface in situ oxidizes to Mo (VI ) upon exposure of the surface to air for 30 min [ 14 ] . Further reduction of the surface by H2 gas in situ at 773 K for 2 h results in a substantial increase in the relative intensity of the Mo ( 3d6/2 ) at 229.7 eV which corresponds to the Mo (IV ) state (Fig. lOb), while the Pt(4f) spin-orbit binding energies did not change (Fig. 9b ). Argon ion bombardment of the sample for 300 s results in a further reduction of the Mo to the almost metallic state at 228.4 and 231.4 eV (Fig. lOc ) . The presence of other oxidation state ( s ) , especially Mo ( IV ), is not excluded, 92 C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 Mo(3d) a 225.00 230.00 235.00 Fig. 10.

On the other hand, we find that the Pt (4f7/2) appears at 71.5 eV (Fig. 9c ), which can be attributed to a certain interaction with the silica surface. The strong Pt-O-Si interaction has been observed after 20 min of Ar+ bombardment, where the Pt (4f7/2) appears at 72.4 eV [ 15 ] . From the above results it can be observed that the H2 treatment of the PMD 50 catalysts at 773 K for 4 h results in the reduction of Pt (IV) to the metallic Pt (0) state, while the Mo is reduced most probably from Mo (VI) to Mo (IV) and even lower oxidation state (s) . The presence of a stationary Mo (VI) state which is strongly interacting with the silica surface in a similar way to that observed in the case of alumina is not observed. C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 93 Discussion From the isomerization activities and selectivities of heganes on Pt-Mo deposited on silica and alumina, we observe the presence of two different types of catalytic behaviour versus the Mo content of the catalyst. Pt-Mo catalysts with low concentration of molybdenum Pt-Mo on silica: (PMD 0 and PMD 14) The catalytic behaviour of these two catalysts is characterized by the high conversion (5 times higher for methylcyclopentane as compared to hesanes 2MP, 3MP and n-H). On these catalysts the cyclic mechanism is predominant, as observed in the case of the transformation of 2- (2-13C) methylpentane, giving 71.4% of 3-(3-13C)methylpentane. The selectivity in isomers and cracked products corresponds to a statistical dissociation of a linear carbon-carbon bond; it is very similar to the behaviour of the 2.5% Pt deposited on alumina catalyst. In fact, Leclercq et al. [5] have shown by chemisorption measurements that the dispersion of Pt in these catalysts is about 60% and that Pt particle size is of the order of 2 nm as determined by electron microscopy [ 15 ] . Pt-Mo on alumina. (PMA 5010% equivalent Pt) It has been observed that the Pt-Mo catalysts deposited on alumina with 3 and 10% equivalent Pt, which are prepared in a similar way to those deposited on silica, are not active at the temperature of 523 K, as used in the case of PtMo/Si02. The activity starts at 623 K with a strong adsorption of hydrocarbon, giving a memory effect. Similar observations were made in the case of the 2.5% Mo deposited on silica or alumina. From the XPS results in the case of relatively low Mo loading of Pt-Mo deposited on alumina and reduced by HZ at 773 K, a strong interaction is observed between Mo and the alumina surface through oxygen atom (s) to form a stationary Mo (VI) phase which acts as a barrier to stop the migration of the reduced and mobile Pt particles on the alumina surface. In order to observe some catalytic activity of Pt-Mo deposited on alumina, a higher loading of Mo is required, as compared to that in the case of silica. This is attributed to the strong interaction effect between the Mo and the alumina surface, while such interaction is not observed in the case of silica support. The order of impregnation of Pt-Mo on alumina plays an important role in the catalytic activity of the system. As we have shown by XPS, in the case of the coimpregnation of the inactive Pt-Mo on alumina at 523 K that the Pt particles are covered by the interacting stationary, Mo phase with the alumina surface. This stationary Mo (VI) phase, which is characterized by the Mo (3db/2) at 233.6 eV, constitutes the only phase of low Mo concentration up to 5% . This Mo phase, which strongly interacts with the alumina surface, cannot be reduced by H2 at 773 K or by argon bombardment. However, at higher 94 C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 Mo concentration, another reducible Mo (VI) mobile phase (Mo3db/2 = 232.8 eV) has been observed. Pt-Mo catalysts with high concentration of molybdenum Pt-Mo on silica: (PMD x, x > 38% catalysts 3% equivalent Pt; PMD 50 10% equivalent Pt) The catalytic behaviour of these catalysts are completely different from those of PMD 0 and PMD 14, as can be seen by the low conversion of hydrocarbons, independent of the nature of the starting hexane. Also, the predominant mechanism is a bond shift mechanism as shown by the transformation of 2- (2-13C) methylpentane to 3- (2-13C) methylpentane (95 %) . It is also observed that the isomer selectivity on these catalysts strongly favours the formation of isomers having the same number of carbon atoms in the chain as the starting compound. This means that the interconvertion of 3-methylpentane to 2-methylpentane and vice versa, or the formation of 2,2-dimethylbutane from 2,3-dimethylbutane occurs. The cracking distribution products on these catalysts seem to strongly favour the dissociation reaction between a primary and a secondary carbon atom. In the case of Pt-Mo deposited on silica, both Mo with different reduced states; Mo (II), Mo (IV) and may be Mo (0) and Pt (0) are present on the silica surface. A weak interaction is observed, if any, between Mo and silica. Pt-Mo on alumina: (PMA 60 and PMA 80) The catalytic behaviour of these two systems is very similar to that of PMD x, x > 38%. The predominant mechanism is a bond shift mechanism, as shown by the transformation of 2- (2-'3C) methylpentane to 3- (213C)methylpentane (87% ). The impregnation of Mo prior to Pt seems to prevent the covering of Pt by the stationary Mo phase. Mo concentrations equal or higher than 6% enable the less interacting, mobile Mo phase to play an active catalytic role. It seems that this mobile phase, which is interacting to some extent with Pt particles, constitutes the catalytic species on the alumina surface. Conclusion The study of the reactivity of different hydrocarbons over Pt-Mo deposited on silica (PMD x) and alumina (PMA) catalysts as a function of the Mo concentration clearly shows the important role of Mo in these bimetallic catalysts. In the case of Pt-Mo supported on silica (PMD x), only one mobile phase of Mo was observed slightly interacting with the silica surface at all Mo concentrations. This mobile phase can easily be reduced by hydrogen or under argon (Ar+) bombardment to different lower oxidation states; Mo (IV), Mo (II) and Mo(0). PMD 0 and PMD 14 are very similar in activity to Pt deposited C. Petit et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 75-95 95 on alumina with small metal aggregates. At higher Mo concentration (PMD x, x > 38% ), the catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts change completely. A strong metal-support interaction between molybdenum and the alumina surface was observed at relatively low concentration; lower than 5% of Mo leading to a stationary, non-reducible phase of molybdenum Mo (VI) strongly anchored to the support in the case of Pt-Mo deposited on alumina. The PMD 50, 10% equivalent of Pt catalysts prepared by the coimpregnation method are catalytically inactive at 523 K. This is attributed to the covering of Pt by the stationary phase of Mo, as revealed by XPS. At higher Mo concentration (> 5% ), another Mo (VI) phase was observed, which can be reduced to lower Mo oxidation state (s ), and this constitutes the mobile, catalytically active phase. The two PMA 60 and PMA 80 catalysts prepared by the impregnation of Mo prior to Pt have very similar catalytic activities to those of PMD x, x > 38% . We found that in both Pt-Mo supported on alumina or silica, the active species is mainly a mobile Mo (IV) phase which interacts to some extent with the reduced Pt (0) particles. The presence of other reduced Mo species which contributes to the catalytic activity is not excluded. References 1 J.H. Sinfelt, Catal. Rev., 9 (1974) 147. 2 Y. Yashu, G. Xiexian, L. Huimin, D.

The catalytic behaviour of silica and alumina supported Pt-Mo catalysts has been studied in the isomerization of hydrogenolysis of hexane hydrocarbons. XPS analyses were performed to follow the different oxidation states of molybdenum alone, or with platinum under hydrogen or under argon bombardment. The XPS analysis showed that molybdenum interacts more strongly with alumina than with silica. As a result, two classes of catalysts were identified, depending on the presence of the reduced relatively mobile, state of molybdenum on the catalyst surface. At low molybdenum content, the catalytic behaviour is similar to the platinum catalysts. But when the molybdenum concentration is increased another type of behaviour emerges, linked to a dual activity between platinum and molybdenum. It has been observed that hydrocarbon structure has a strong influence on the catalyst selectivity. When no tertiary carbon atoms are present in the hydrocarbon, the cracking reactions occur very deeply. Only secondary and primary carbon atoms are involved in the degradation process. The isomerization reaction is only a bond shift reaction. Keywords alumina hexanes molybdenum platinum silica skeletal rearrangements surface structures References 1 J.H. Sinfelt Catal.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic behaviour of silica and alumina supported Pt-Mo catalysts has been studied in the isomerization of hydrogenolysis of hexane hydrocarbons. XPS analyses were performed to follow the different oxidation states of molybdenum alone, or with platinum under hydrogen or under argon bombardment. The XPS analysis showed that molybdenum interacts more strongly with alumina than with silica. As a result, two classes of catalysts were identified, depending on the presence of the reduced relatively mobile, state of molybdenum on the catalyst surface. At low molybdenum content, the catalytic behaviour is similar to the platinum catalysts. But when the molybdenum concentration is increased another type of behaviour emerges, linked to a dual activity between platinum and molybdenum. It has been observed that hydrocarbon structure has a strong influence on the catalyst selectivity. When no tertiary carbon atoms are present in the hydrocarbon, the cracking reactions occur very deeply. Only secondary and primary carbon atoms are involved in the degradation process. The isomerization reaction is only a bond shift reaction.",
