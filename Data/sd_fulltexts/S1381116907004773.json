Graphical abstract In this paper we report on new silica immobilized di(ethylthio)ethane and di(ethylthio)propane palladium catalysts where the presence of two sulfur donor atoms in the immobilized ligands assist Pd binding. Catalyst synthesis and use in Suzuki coupling chemistry under two different sets of conditions, isopropanol at room temperature and hot xylene is reported. The catalysts may be recycled and are resistant to leaching in both cases. Novel heterogeneous silica supported 1,2-bis(ethylthio)ethane palladium and 1,2-bis(ethylthio)propane palladium catalysts are reported. Applied to Suzuki coupling chemistry these catalysts are very effective, reusable and resist leaching at room temperature in isopropanol or in hot xylene. Keywords Dithio palladium 1,2-Bis(trimethoxysilylethylthio)ethane and 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilylethylthio)propane Palladium Cross-coupling Suzuki Silica support Immobilized di(ethylthio)ethane Di(ethylthio)propane 1 Introduction Many palladium complexes as well as supported palladium complexes have been investigated as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, respectively, for Suzuki CC bond forming reactions. This chemistry is compatible with a large variety of functional groups. The literature covering this area has very recently been reviewed and an extensive range of reaction conditions has been explored [1]. The challenges for the heterogeneous systems are linked to maximising activity while minimising the palladium requirement and optimising ligand design to prevent palladium leaching. To this end many different types of immobilized ligands have been explored to bind, for example, palladium chloride or palladium acetate for use in heterogeneous catalytic Suzuki chemistry. The list of silica-immobilized palladium binding ligands includes Schiff bases [2], N-heterocyclic carbene [3], polyamines or pyridine [4] and imadazolylpropyl [5]. Of particular relevance to this paper are studies on silica-immobilized sulfur containing ligands. Shimizu and co-workers reported that silica supported mercaptopropyl palladium is virtually resistant to leaching of palladium during Suzuki and Heck coupling [6]. Using similar catalysts Crudden confirmed minimal leaching of palladium by three-phase tests and analysis of hot filtrates [7]. We recently reported on silica-immobilized palladium ethylthioglycolate catalysts for both Heck and Suzuki coupling [8]. We found that this system was effective and recyclable with no evidence of palladium leaching. The effective palladium binding was attributed to the presence of sulfur in the thioglycolate ligand. In this paper we report on new silica immobilized di(ethylthio)ethane and di(ethylthio)propane palladium catalysts having two sulfur donor atoms in the immobilized ligands to enhance binding through sulfur coordination. Catalyst synthesis and conditions for use in Suzuki coupling chemistry at both room temperature and 110°C are reported. 2 Results and discussion In this paper we report on the synthesis, characterisation, and catalytic activity of some functionalised silica materials derived from 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilylethylthio)ethane 1 and 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilylethylthio)propane 2. The silica supported derivatives, silica∼(CH2CH2S(CH2)2SCH2CH2)∼silica 3 and silica∼(CH2CH2S(CH2)3SCH2CH2)∼silica 4 were formed from the trimethoxysilyl compounds by grafting to commercial silica with pore size 60Å (see Scheme 1 ). Post-modification of 3 and 4 with palladium acetate gave materials 5 and 6 with likely structures shown in Scheme 1. Trimethyl- and triphenylsilyl analogues of 1 and 2, 1,2-bis(trimethylsilylethylthio)ethane, 7 and 1,3-bis(triphenylsilylethylthio)propane, 8, were also prepared to aid confirmation of NMR assignments of the solid phase immobilized heterogeneous systems. Immobilisation was confirmed by solid state NMR, 13C (ligand resonances observed) and 29Si (T and Q resonances observed). The functional group loadings were estimated from sulfur analysis and the Pd loading by ICP-OES after digestion. Sulfur analysis indicated that the grafted material 3 had a ligand, Si(CH2CH2S(CH2)2SCH2CH2)Si, loading of 0.6mmolg−1 while 4 had Si(CH2CH2S(CH2)3SCH2CH2)Si loading 0.5mmolg−1. The supported Pd catalysts used in this work were prepared by stirring the grafted materials 3 or 4 with palladium acetate in THF at room temperature for 24h. Deep orange coloured palladium acetate loaded materials 5 and 6 were obtained. The PdS2C2 and PdS2C3 ligation indicated in the scheme for 5 and 6 is featured in a large number of palladium complexes, for example see [9] or [10], listed on the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. The uptake of palladium acetate by 3 and 4 is extremely rapid. The measured Pd loadings were 0.38mmolg−1 5 and 0.46mmolg−1 6. The surface areas of the materials decreased from ∼380m2/g in 3 and 4 to ∼200m2/g in 5 and 6 after treatment with palladium acetate which is consistent with similar palladium acetate uptake. The 13C CPMAS spectra show line broadening of all resonances in 5 and 6 relative to 3 and 4, respectively (exemplified for 4 and 6 in Fig. 1 ). A new peak at ∼90ppm in the Pd acetate loaded material may be assigned to the quaternary carbon of bidentate acetate. Materials 5 and 6 were assessed as heterogeneous catalysts for a range of Suzuki coupling reactions under two different sets of reaction conditions. The results are given in Table 1 . The choice of conditions used, hot xylene and potassium carbonate as base, for the first set of experiments with catalysts 5 and 6 was based on those frequently reported for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysed Suzuki coupling reactions and those we previously employed for similar reactions with immobilized palladium glycolate catalysts [8]. Under these conditions close to quantitative conversions were observed for the Suzuki reactions with aryl bromides. The catalysts could be recycled without loss in activity. This was typically accomplished by removal of supernatant liquid from the catalyst followed by addition of fresh substrates, solvent and base. A filtration protocol, wherein fresh base was added to the hot filtrate, was applied to the reaction with bromoanisole as substrate, 50min into the run. This resulted in no further conversion which is indicative of negligible palladium leaching. The apparent excess of Pd free sulfur ligand sites in the materials should facilitate Pd retention. The catalyst is clearly more active and activity more effectively preserved between runs with activated bromide substrates under these conditions (conversion is slower for entries 3 and 4). Chloroanisole was not converted. There are no major differences in activity between the catalysts 5 and 6 under these conditions. The second set of experiments using 5 and 6 were performed at room temperature using isopropanol in place of xylene and sodium tert-butoxide as base. These reducing conditions had previously been used by Nolan et al. in studies involving homogeneous palladium carbene catalysts [11]. High and recyclable conversions were achieved with 6 for aryl bromide substrates at room temperature under these conditions while 5 was a little more sluggish particularly with less activated substrates. This is in contrast to the reactions carried out in hot xylene where the catalysts showed very similar activity. The slightly lower Pd loading and surface area and slightly more constrained PdS2C2 coordination environment in 5 may be more limiting at room temperature. The catalysts were recycled without significant drop in activity. Conversion to the coupled product ceased when the reactions were filtered after 1h (and fresh base added). This is indicative of negligible Pd leaching. Once again chloroanisole was not converted. Cesium carbonate proved an effective alternative to the tert-butoxide base for bromotoluene under these conditions although other bases including triethylamine and sodium acetate were less effective. In terms of mechanism, the reaction conditions utilizing isopropanol are typically reducing for Pd(II) so that a Pd(0)/(II) couple is envisaged for the cycle. In contrast the reactions carried out in xylene are not obviously reducing for Pd(II) and so are more likely to proceed by the Pd(II)/(IV) couple. Further studies on the catalytic materials are in hand to probe these mechanistic aspects. The compounds 1 and 2 can also be processed by sol-gel routes with TEOS to give very high loaded silica supported di(ethylthio)ethane and propane products or they may be processed alone to give the organobridged polysilsesquioxanes. Details and properties of these materials will be published in due course. 3 Experimental 3.1 General information All reagents used were purchased from Aldrich, Avocado or Lancaster and were used without further purification, unless otherwise stated.

Analysis showed no further conversion following this hot filtration. For the reactions carried out in isopropanol at room temperature the reaction mixture was filtered after 1h. Further solvent and base was added to the filtrate and the reaction continued in the absence of catalyst for a further 3h. Conversion was found to be 43% at 60min. Analysis showed no further conversion following this filtration.
