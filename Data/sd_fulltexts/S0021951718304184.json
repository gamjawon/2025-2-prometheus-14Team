Graphical abstract This paper describes core-shell cobalt-manganese oxides with specific morphologies and oxygen vacancies for electrochemical water oxidation. Developing efficient and stable non-noble electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the promising and challenging issues. This paper describes an approach to prepare core-shell cobalt-manganese oxides with specific morphologies and oxygen vacancies. Via a facile seed growth method, facets evolution is achieved during the formation of core-shell structure. Benefited from optimized surface environment, oxygen vacancy-enriched octahedral cobalt-manganese oxides supported on Ni foam exhibited relatively low overpotential of 284 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and diminutive tafel slope of 73.1 mV dec−1 as well as long-term stability. This work successfully unveils a method for facet-modulation of core-shell metal oxides as efficient electrochemical OER catalysts. Keywords Cobalt-manganese oxides Core-shell structure Facet-evolution growth Oxygen vacancy Oxygen evolution reaction Faced with the environmental contamination and fossil fuel depletion, it is urgent to exploit clean and renewable energy sources [1–3]. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a pivotal half-reaction of water splitting, CO2 reduction and metal-air batteries, is achieving ever-increasing attention nowadays [4–9]. In consideration of its four-electron process, the development of efficient OER catalysts still remains a huge challenge due to its sluggish kinetics and high-overpotential demand [10–14]. Currently, precious metal oxides, such as Ir- and Ru-based oxides, are generally served as OER catalysts [15,16]. However, commercial utility of these materials is hindered by their exorbitant price and limited reserves. Therefore, highly efficient and affordable OER catalysts are extremely urgent. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are considered as one type of promising candidate catalysts, due to their efficient activity towards OER, storage abundance and corrosion resistance in alkaline medium. Among them, Co/Mn-based oxides have been paid attention to especially due to their relatively efficient OER performance and tunable geometric/electronic structure. [17–21]. In order to achieve efficient OER performance, considerable approaches have been developed to improve the electrochemical activity of Co/Mn-based oxides, including chemical composition optimization [22], high-energy interface construction [23], specific morphology design [24] and etc. Owing to the surface process of oxygen evolution, exposed crystal facets would make a significant contribution to catalysts performance with their distinct atom arrangements. For instance, Xiao et al. demonstrated that (1 1 1)-exposed Co3O4 octahedrons with more surface Co2+ ions showed better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity than (1 0 0)-exposed Co3O4 nanocubes. The surface Co2+ sites benefited to break O-O bond with more electron around absorbed O2 molecules [25]. Li et al. claimed that Co3O4 nanosheets exposed with (1 1 2) crystal plane could reduce the temperature of CO oxidation owing to more open reactive surface and missed neighbors of a unit cell [26]. Xiao et al reported that Co3O4 octahedron exposure larger number of Co2+ and Co3+ sites, which were good for the charge/discharge capacity and rate capability of lithium ion batteries [27]. Meanwhile, it is important of the surface structure to OER performance. Owing to the difficulty of direct synthesis of facets-dependent CoxMn3-xO4 particles, core-shell structure will make shell modulation come true, such as facets evolution [28], electronic structure optimization [29] and coordination number construction [30]. Nevertheless, there are few researches prepared the facet-controlled cobalt-manganese oxides. Herein, seed-mediated growth method was adopted to obtain CoxMn3-xO4 with specific facets. Octahedral, truncated-octahedral and cubic Mn3O4@CoxMn3-xO4 core-shell nanoparticles were successfully prepared by using Mn3O4 as seeds. Three types of Mn3O4@CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles, including cubes, truncated octahedrons and octahedrons, were successfully synthesized through seed-mediated growth method (denoted as Cubic NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Octahedral NPs). The electrochemical results show that the Octahedral NPs exhibited higher OER activity than Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs due to more exposed sites and richer oxygen vacancies. Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs were synthesized via seed-mediated growth at 90 °C with the presence of oleylamine (OLA), oleic acid (OA) and water [31,32]. Fig. S1 showed the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of cubic and octahedral Mn3O4 seeds. After shell formation, the initial Mn3O4 seeds gradually evolved into Cubic NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Octahedral NPs as illustrated in Scheme 1 . Fig. 1 A–C displayed low-magnification TEM images of these three samples. Fig. 1D–F were their high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images with inserted FFT models. The average particle sizes (the longer spacing between two opposing corners) of Cubic/Truncated octahedral/Octahedral NPs were 12.3 nm, 11.5 nm and 13.2 nm, respectively. HRTEM images of individual Mn3O4@CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles highlighted the ultrathin CoxMn3-xO4 shell as the white line displayed. The lattice spacing of 0.28 nm, 0.48 nm and 0.48 nm could be assigned to the (1 1 3), (1 1 1) and (1 1 1) plane of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 shell (JCPDS Card 18-0408) of Cubic NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs, Octahedral NPs, respectively. Furthermore, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) element scanning also indicated that Mn element mainly existed inner the nanoparticles and Co element dispersed around the nanoparticles (Fig. 1G). Besides, EDS line scan also showed the core-shell distribution of Mn/Co elements (Fig. 1H), indicating the successful construction of Mn3O4@CoxMn3-xO4 catalysts via seed-mediated growth. Concretely, a series of experiments were conducted via the adjustment of synthetic parameters to understand the synthesis mechanism. During the preparation of Mn3O4 seeds, 2:1 ratio of OLA/OA produced cubic Mn3O4 NPs and 1:1 ratio of OLA/OA resulted in octahedral Mn3O4. This result indicated that the OLA served not only as the reduction agent, but also as the selective capping agent of (1 0 0) crystal planes. According to Wuff facet theory, crystal growth would occur rapidly around high-free-energy facets after the nucleation stage and crystal with low-free-energy facets would be gained finally [33]. Therefore, it could be concluded that the OLA was the capping agent to stabilize the high-free-energy (1 0 0) facets. In addition, morphology evolution occurred during the shell-growth process, which might result from the weaker and less interaction between the Mn3O4 NPs and OLA molecules oriented by the added water. Owing to the attenuation of OLA, the high-energy facets were not stable and the particles evolved to the truncated-octahedral structure eventually. To further confirm above hypothesis, cubic Mn3O4 seeds were reacted at 90 °C for 2 h only with 12 mL deionized water as the control experiment. As the Fig. S2 showed, the cubic Mn3O4 NPs evolved into truncated-octahedral morphology. The results preferably manifested the capping role of OLA. Additionally, we proposed that Mn2+ in the reagent was responsible for CoxMn3-xO4 shell formation. To better understand the contribution of remained Mn2+, the Mn3O4 seeds were collected after centrifugation and washing. The shell growth was conducted in the reagent of purified Mn3O4 seeds, xylene, OLA, OA and little content of Mn(AC)2. As the Fig. S3 showed, the truncated octahedral Mn@CoMnO particles with homogenous shell were also obtained. The ratio of Co/Mn ratios of these three catalysts were further detected via ICP test. The results showed similar molar ratio of Co/Mn of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs were 2.64, 2.70 and 2.69, respectively. Above all, we deduced that the generation of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs was attributed to the capping role of OLA, formation of CoxMn3-xO4 shell between the remained Mn ions and added Co ions. The phase information of three samples was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The obtained Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs could match well with Co-Mn mixed oxides (JCPDS Card 18-0408; Fig. 2 A) [34,35]. Surface states of these obtained samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All of Co, Mn and O existed as the survey spectra showed in Fig. S4. The fined-scanned Mn 2p XPS spectra, Co 2p XPS spectra and O 1s XPS spectra were detected to demonstrate the detailed valence states. As Fig. 2B showed, Mn 2p spectrum owned two main spin-orbit lines at the binding energies of 641.2 eV and 652.9 eV, which were belonged to the Mn2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 peaks. As Fig. 2C showed, the fitted peaks of Co 2p spectra were Co2+ and Co3+, respectively. The binding energies at 782.1 eV of Co2+ and 780.2 eV of Co3+ belonged to the Co 2p 3/2 in the main peaks, while the binding energies at 797.2 eV of Co2+ and 795.6 eV of Co3+ belonged to the Co 2p 1/2 in the main peaks [36–38]. Besides the spin-orbit splitting value of Co 2p 1/2 and Co 2p 3/2 was about 15 eV. To further explore the surface Co condition, a quantitative analysis about the valence distribution of cobalt on the catalysts surface was calculated from the XPS fitted spectra. By calculating the area that the fitted curve covered, we could conclude that ratio of Co2+/Co3+ on the surface of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs were 0.83, 0.71 and 0.52, respectively. The higher percentage of low state Co2+ exhibited more open coordination and oxygen vacancies as well, which could also be reflected from O 1s spectra. As Fig. 2D showed, three types of oxygen peaks were clearly observed. The peaks located at 529.9 eV, 531.5 eV and 532.9 eV were attributed to the lattice O, O vacancies and surface-adsorbed water molecules, respectively [39,40]. The area of the peak at 531.5 eV is the largest of Octahedral NPs, showing the highest percentage of vacancy sites [40,41]. As the previous work reported, the lower the lattice oxygen content the higher the oxygen vacancy concentration [42]. Via calculating the peak area of surface elements, the ratios of Co:Mn:lattice O of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs was 1:2:1.9, 1:1.9:2 and 1:1.7:2.2, respectively. This result further showed the highest oxygen vacancies of Octahedral NPs. To identify the relationship of structure and OER performance, electrochemical measurements were carried out via a standard three-electrode system in O2-saturared 1.0 M KOH solution. Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs were dipped on the Ni foam as the working electrodes. Ni foam was used as a three-dimensional catalyst support to further deliver high current densities owing to its high surface area and complementary catalysis [43]. As displayed in Fig. 3 A and Fig. S5, Octahedral NPs exhibited 284 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, lower than Truncated octahedral NPs (306 mV), Cubic NPs (311 mV) and commercial RuO2 (296 mV). Tafel slope results (Fig. 3B) showed that Octahedral NPs had minimal tafel slope of 73.1 mV dec−1 smaller than that of Truncated octahedral NPs (76.9 mV dec−1), Cubic NPs (88 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (92.4 mV dec−1). Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also conducted under the potential bias of 0.52 V (vs. Ag/AgCl; Fig. S6). The semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). It is clearly revealed that charge-transfer resistance followed an order of Octahedral NPs < Truncated octahedral NPs < Cubic NPs. To identify the reason behind the various OER behavior, electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was simulated via electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) by collecting cyclic voltammetry (Figs. 4 A and S7) [44]. The calculated Cdl values were ∼6.0 mF cm−2, ∼5.0 mF cm−2 and ∼3.6 mF cm−2, respectively, showing the most abundant OER active sites of Octahedral NPs. To further elucidate the different OER performance of particle shapes and remove the influence of Ni foam, polarization curves of these three catalysts were launched on the glassy carbon (Fig. S8) and then normalized the Cdl to explore intrinsic properties of different facets. As Fig. 4B showed, more efficient intrinsic OER activity of (1 1 1) facet than (1 0 0) facet was displayed. In addition, long-term electrochemical stability was also demonstrated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 3C) under stirring condition. All of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs, Cubic NPs and RuO2 carried out 20-h stability at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 [45,46]. Negligible difference in overpotential and current density was attained at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The detailed morphologies of these three catalysts were also characterized after 20-h stability tests. As Fig. 5 A–F showed, several cubic nanoparticles changed into truncated nanoparticles due to the removal of surfactant. The high-energy (1 0 0) facets converted to low-energy (1 1 1) facets to maintain the structure stability. While the surface of three catalysts still maintained the crystalline as the Fig. 5D–F displayed. In addition, XRD patterns after OER test also showed the bulk crystalline of these three catalysts (Fig. S9). XPS spectra after OER test showed that oxides surface was covered with -OH species and -OH coverage of Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs was 0.92, 0.87, 0.84, respectively, showing the successful transformation of O vacancies into active MOOH phase for oxygen evolution reaction (Fig. S10). Oxygen vacancies were essential for hydroxyl group capture and formation of OER-active oxy(hydroxide) surface as well as suitable adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface as the previous work reported [42,47]. In summary, we developed a facile method to prepare Mn@CoMnO NPs with facet modulation. Owing to the capping role of OLA and the deposition of the remained Mn ions and added Co ions for the CoMnO shells, Octahedral NPs, Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs were successfully synthesized. Octahedral NPs presented 284 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and minimal tafel slope of 73.1 mV dec−1 as well as long-term stability. Owing to multiple active sites, plentiful oxygen vacancies, low charge-transfer resistance and other artifacts, Octahedral NPs exhibited higher OER activity compared to Truncated octahedral NPs and Cubic NPs. The above work exhibited a method for rational design of facet-modulation of core-shell metal oxides as effective oxygen evolution catalysts.
