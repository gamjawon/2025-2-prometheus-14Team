The homogeneous distribution profile of NiO and NiFez04 on the surface and in the bulk of the catalyst is essential for the formation of phenol. Keywords: Benzoic acid; NiO-Fe203 catalyst; Oxidation; Phenol; Vapour phase oxidation 1. Introduction The oxidation of toluene to phenol is one of the conventional methods for the commercial production of phenol. In the Dow process, for example, toluene is first oxidized to benzoic acid a using cobalt-manganese catalyst, and then the benzoic acid is oxidized to phenol using a copper catalyst. Although a number of copper based catalysts for the latter reaction have been studied and proposed, the problems such as low yield of phenol, tar formation and catalyst deactivation still remain unsolved [ 1-15 ] . In order to solve these problems we have already proposed novel catalysts composed of NiO and Fe203 which exhibit excellent activity for the reaction [ 16,17 ] . In this Letter we investigated the relationship between the structure of the Ni0-Fe203 catalyst and the catalytic activity to identify the active species. *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental Fe203-NiO catalysts were prepared by a precipitation method with aqueous solutions of metal nitrates and sodium hydroxide. The precipitates obtained were washed with pure water until they became free from sodium, dried and then calcined in air at a temperature of 800 C for 4 h. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure using a continuous flow type reaction apparatus with a fixed catalyst bed. The organic products and effluent gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph using flame ionization and thermal conductivity detection. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by the BET technique with a Shimadzu ASAP2000. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using nickel filtered Cu Ka radiation with a Rigaku Ru-300 diffractometer. Electron probe microanalyses (EPMA) were carried out using a Shimadzu EMX-SM7. The electron gun was operated at 15 kV and the transitions chosen for this study were Ka for Fe and Ni. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed using an SSI SSX-100 instrument with Al Ka X-ray radiation. Quantitative determinations were made by correcting the ratios of the peak areas (Fe2P3/2, Ni2P3/2) using the instrumental sensitivities for the pure oxides. 3.

The structures of oxides were identified by comparing their XRD spectra with those of NiO, NiFe204 and Fe203.

It was proved that NiFe204 is formed in preference to NiO or Fe203 under the preparation conditions. The activities of the catalysts for phenol synthesis are summarized in Table 1.

On the other hand, the nickel-rich catalysts gave low conversions while the iron-rich catalysts showed low selectivities to phenol. A high nickel content resulted in a relatively low surface area. The catalyst composed of only NiFe204, i.e. with a Ni/Fe atomic ratio of 0.5, showed extremely low selectivity to phenol. These results indicate that NiFe.104 is not essential for the formation of phenol. Fig. 2 exhibits the results of EPMA. The cylindrical catalyst (Ni/Fe=1) was analyzed along the dotted line shown in Fig. 2. Evidently the catalyst has a very homogeneous profile. In conjunction with the quantitative analysis, equal amounts of nickel and iron are distributed uniformly from the surface to the center of the catalyst. In order to investigate the relation of the amounts of components at the surface and in the bulk, composition analyses were performed by EPMA and XPS. The linear plots in Fig. 3 indicate that the elemental composition of the bulk is proportional to that of the surface. Thus it is proved that the surface composition reflects the mass components in the catalyst preparation. Fig. 4 exhibits the XPS spectra of Ni 2P3,z level of NiO, NiFe204 and the catalyst (Ni/Fe=1). The signal of the catalyst shown in the middle trace in Fig. 4 appears to be the medium in shape and width compared with those of NiO and NiFe204 [ 18-20] .

Miki et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) Gl-LS L5 two kinds of oxides, namely NiO and NiFe204, exist on the surface of the catalyst. As mentioned above, NiFe204is not an active species for the formation of phenol. In addition, it is difficult to consider that NiO is essential for phenol production. Because Ni0-rich catalysts such as that with a molar ratio of NiO to NiFe2O4 of 3 gave low conversion levels as shown in Table 1. The low conversion might be attributed to the low surface area of the catalyst. These results lead to an assumption that finely dispersed NiO in NiFe2O4 is an active species for phenol formation. In conclusion, the catalyst with a Ni/Fe atomic ratio of 1 exhibited excellent activity for the vapor-phase oxidation of benzoic acid to form phenol selectivity. The homogeneous distribution profile of NiO and NiFe204on the surface and in the bulk of the catalyst is found to be effective for the enhancement of catalytic activity. References [ 1 ] W.W.
