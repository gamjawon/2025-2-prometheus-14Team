A potent methodology was designed for the one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of the biomass-based olefin, (R)-carvone in an aqueous biphasic medium, regiospecifically producing the corresponding linear aldehyde as the desired product. The protocol was made more sustainable as a result of, the reusability of the catalytic system, the use of water as an eco-solvent, the employment of affordable ligand and phase transfer agent. Moreover, only a single Rh-based catalyst was applied for executing distinct reactions at two different remote sites of the substrate. Selectivity tuning of the system with respect to temperature, pressure, concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), catalyst to ligand ratio, kinds of phase transfer agents, aqueous phase volume, reaction time and catalyst to substrate ratio furnished a high chemoselectivity of 97 %, along with a full conversion. The catalytic system could be recycled for at least four consecutive cycles without a significant loss in the activity.

At the beginning, the first-generation cobalt catalyst precursors were utilized for this purpose, however, they proved to be inefficient in furnishing a good selectivity to the system, even with the use of high pressures and temperatures [4–7]. Varied metal catalysts like platinum/tin have been investigated in an attempt to improve the efficiency of the process, though to date, rhodium derived complexes remain the best-suited due to their characteristic of providing a superior selectivity to the reaction system without the need of extreme experimental setups [8–13]. In order to suffice the needs of the huge population, numerous chemicals are produced every year and for their production, non-renewable resources are exploited which has raised concerns in regard to the depletion of these resources in the near future. Therefore, one of the most practical and smart approaches is to utilize biomass-derived feedstocks which serve as inexpensive, naturally occurring and widely abundant sources to procure value-added end products by bringing about chemical transformations [14–15]. One such category of bio-renewable sources is terpenes [16]. Terpenes are abundantly available in nature and also hold potential uses in many industries such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances, foods, flavors and cosmetics because of their pleasant fragrance and biological activity [17–21]. An example of a potentially useful terpene is (R)-carvone which is obtained from caraway and spearmint essential oils and possesses olfactory properties [22]. Hydroformylation being a widely utilized process, the use of bio-based renewable olefins can cut down the overuse of non-renewables to a large extent, hence creating a sustainable approach while still producing the required chemicals [23]. The hydroformylation of (R)-carvone has only been scarcely investigated and hence, very few reports are available in the literature, in this regard [24–27]. Rh-catalyzed hydroformylation of carvone was initially reported in the form of a patent in 1983 mentioning harsh and broad range of reaction conditions to receive moderate yield of 60–70 % [24]. The next work was published in 1990, wherein the application of platinum/tin catalytic system was made, howbeit the conversion and yield remained at only 60 % and 59 %, respectively, under the optimized conditions [25]. The subsequent work was done, by Bhagade and Bhanage in 2018, to design domino multistep protocol to synthesize 1,5-dimethylhexahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one in a Rh-based system [26]. The most recent work is from our research group which deals with an efficient single-step hydroformylation of (R)-carvone with an almost complete conversion and an excellent yield of 95 % [27]. Apart from using renewable starting materials, there are certain other approaches through which sustainability can be improved, such as, devising setups with recoverable and reusable biphasic catalytic systems, use of green solvents, development of one-pot processes and targeting multiple reactions with a single catalyst [28–29]. Aqueous biphasic systems provide the benefit of recyclability, while using the environmentally-friendly and commercially cheap solvent, water [30–31]. For such systems, the frequently utilized aqueous-phase-soluble ligand is triphenylphosphine-3,3′,3′′-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (TPPTS), due to its cost-effectiveness, which was first applied to propene hydroformylation in 1984 [32]. Such systems require the aid of phase transfer agents, like cyclodextrins and surfactants [33–34]. One-pot processes lead toward sustainability because of the reduction in, chemical wastage involved with the multi-step chemical reactions and product separations, minimization of time and labor, as well as process efficiency [35–36]. Additionally, the use of a single catalyst, with no other co-catalyst, for carrying out multiple reactions at different remote sites of a substrate increases the overall sustainability of the process as the number and amount of chemicals are cut down [37]. The present work reports an efficient strategy for the one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of the naturally occurring olefin, (R)-carvone in a recyclable aqueous biphasic medium. A comparative study of the research work on the hydroformylation and associated reactions of (R)-carvone in literature intrigued the designing of this novel methodology (Fig. 1 ). For this purpose, a single rhodium-based catalyst precursor, without any co-catalyst, was used for two different reactions at two different remote sites of the substrate, that is, hydroformylation at the outer terminal double bond and hydrogenation at the hindered endocyclic double bond. Interestingly, Wilkinson's and related rhodium-derived catalysts have not been known to carry out the hydrogenation of hindered double bonds, as in this case. In addition, rhodium complexes are selective toward hydroformylation reaction under the conditions set for hydroformylation. In our knowledge, the aqueous biphasic one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of (R)-carvone, with the resultant aldehyde as the desired product, has never been designed hitherto. Moreover, the utilization of a rhodium-based catalyst for carrying out simultaneous hydroformylation and hydrogenation at varied double bonds of the substrate selectively, has seldom been reported. The primary goal was to design a system for the novel hydroformylation/hydrogenation of the underexplored renewable olefin (R)-carvone with sustainability benefits of one-pot process, water as a green solvent, single catalyst for dual reactions and recyclability of the catalytic system, at the same time providing high conversion and selectivity. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods The chemicals were obtained from reputed vendors such as Sigma Aldrich, TCI chemicals, Alfa Aesar etc. and were used without further processing, unless mentioned otherwise. Inert atmosphere was maintained while performing all the experiments. Synthesis gas was procurred from Rakhangi gas service. Distilled deionized water was added as the solvent in the reactions. All the experimental reactions were conducted in a 100 mL stainless steel high-pressure autoclave. Gas chromatography (GC) was employed for the study of the yields and conversions of the reactions while gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used for the identification of the products. ThermoScientific Trace 1110 GC instrument, with flame ionization detector and Shimadzu GCMS–-QP 2010 operating at 70 eV were employed for this purpose. The major product was characterized with 1H and 13CNMR (δ in ppm) spectra which were recorded on Agilent Technologies NMR spectrometer with 500 MHz and 126 MHz operating frequencies, respectively, in CDCl3 solvent using tetramethyl silane as the internal standard. Column chromatography was performed for the separation of the major product from the crude reaction mixture. 2.2 Procedure for (R)-carvone hydroformylation in an aqueous biphasic medium In a 100 mL autoclave, (R)-carvone (3.75 mmol), [Rh(acac)(CO)2] (0.01 mmol), TPPTS (0.04 mmol), CTAB (8.0 μmol) and distilled deionized water (10 mL) were introduced. The reactor was closed and flushed thrice with syngas, then subjected to 45 bar and heated at 90 °C for 21 h with 700 rpm of stirring. After the reaction time was complete, the reactor was cool ed down to the room temperature by switching off the heater, then it was depressurized by venting out the excess syngas carefully. Following this, the reactor was opened, its contents were transferred to a separatory funnel and ethyl acetate was added as the extracting solvent. The two layers were then mixed by vigorous shaking and then allowed to separate. The product phase was washed three times with water and passed through sodium sulfate to eliminate the presence of moisture. This organic phase containing the products was then subjected to GC and GC–MS analysis. 2.3 Procedure for catalyst recycling To study the system's recyclability, several experiments were conducted. For this, a 100 mL high-pressure reactor was charged with (R)-carvone (3.75 mmol), [Rh(acac)(CO)2] (0.01 mmol), TPPTS (0.32 mmol), CTAB (8.0 μmol) and distilled deionized water (10 mL) were added. The run was conducted at 45 bar pressure of syngas, 90 °C for 21 h with 700 rpm of stirring. After cooling the reactor, excess gas was first vented out before opening it. Then the contents of the reactor were transferred to a separatory funnel along with ethyl acetate as the extracting organic solvent. The funnel was thoroughly shaken for the mixing of the two phases which were then allowed to separate. The upper organic layer containing the organic products was washed thrice with water, passed through sodium sulfate for elimination of any water content and used for further GC and GC–MS analysis to study the conversion and yield, and to identify the various organic components present. The aqueous phase was collected with formed emulsion. The recovered aqueous phase containing the rhodium catalyst, TPPTS and CTAB was charged into the 100 mL reactor along with the substrate, (R)-carvone (3.75 mmol) and subjected to the same parameters as in the fresh run. The separation of the phases was again carried out and the recyclability study was performed for five runs, in each case, using the aqueous phase of the previous run. This biphasic catalytic system could be efficiently recycled at the least for four consecutive runs. 3 Results and discussion The hydroformylation of (R)-carvone, a natural terpene has not been studied till date in an aqueous biphasic medium. (R)-carvone (1a) under hydroformylation conditions in Rh-catalyzed aqueous biphasic medium yields the linear aldehyde, 3-(4-methyl-3-oxocyclohexyl)butanal (2a) as the main product (Scheme 1 ). This reaction is regiospecific in terms of the linear aldehyde as no branched aldehyde trace was detected in any of the experiments conducted. Herein, a single catalyst, which is rhodium derived, gives two different reactions at two different remote sites of the substrate. The outer terminal double bond was hydroformylated, along with a simultaneous hydrogenation of the hindered endocyclic double bond to give the major aldehyde product, thus making this system highly selective and efficient for the one-pot formation of 2a. The employment of a single catalyst for the dual reaction of the substrate in a one pot fashion not only reduces the cost of the process, but also the time, labor and chemical wastage involved with a multi-step synthesis. In addition, inexpensive reagents such as water-soluble ligand (TPPTS), phase transfer agent (CTAB) and solvent (water) led to a further cut down of the process cost. Moreover, water which is a green solvent was used as the only solvent in all the experimental reactions making the process even more sustainable. The major aldehyde product was formed as a diastereomeric mixture as the substrate already possessed a chiral center ‘R’ and two new stereogenic centers were developed due to the reactions at the two remote sites of the substrate. Each newly generated stereogenic center could be either ‘R or S’, thus forming four isomers of the product which are diastereomeric to each other in nature. These diastereomers were inseparable in GC and GC–MS analysis, as well as through column chromatography. The product mixtures themselves had pleasant fragrance which provide them a potential to be used in fragrance industries without further separation. The prominent side products were 3-(4-methyl-5-oxocyclohex-3-en-1-yl)butanal (3a) from the terminal double bond's hydroformylation of carvone, 5-(4-hydroxybutan-2-yl)-2-methylcyclohex-2-enone (4a) formed due to one-pot reductive hydroformylation, 5-isopropyl-2-methylcyclohex-2-enone (5a) and 5-isopropyl-2-methylcyclohexanone (6a) resultant of direct reduction of carvone's double bonds, 2-methyl-5-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclohex-2-enone (7a) from isomerization of the substrate double bond, 3‑hydroxy-1,5-dimethyl-3,3′,7,7′-tetrahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one (8a) and 3‑hydroxy-1,5-dimethylhexahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one (9a) from aldol reaction and 1,5-dimethyl-3,3′,7,7′-tetrahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one and 1,5-dimethyl-5,6,7,7′-tetrahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one, (10a) and 1,5-dimethylhexahydro-1H-inden-4(2H)-one (11a) from aldol condensation (Fig. 2 ). The products, 3a, 5a, 6a and 7a were produced from the direct reaction of the substrate (Scheme 2 ). However, majority of the side products were generated from 3a in a one-pot fashion including the major product, 2a. 8a, 9a, 10a, and 11a were a result of the aldol reaction and aldol condensation of 2a or 3a [26]. Due to the sensitivity of the system with respect to its conditions, a careful tuning of the several parameters played a crucial role in the development of a highly chemoselective methodology. 3.1 Hydroformylation/hydrogenation of (R)-carvone in Rh-catalyzed aqueous biphasic system For the chemoselective one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of (R)-carvone in an aqueous biphasic medium, a rigorous screening of various reaction parameters was required as the system had the tendency to form multiple side products. Hence, in order to achieve an efficient conversion of the substrate and yield of the desired product, varied conditions such as temperature, pressure, Rh/L ratio, CTAB concentration, different types of phase transfer agents, aqueous phase volume, duration of reaction and Rh/substrate ratio were studied. In all the experimental reactions, the catalyst precursor, [Rh(acac)(CO)2], water soluble phosphine ligand, TPPTS and solvent, distilled deionized water were employed. 3.1.1 Effect of temperature and pressure The optimization study was started with the screening of the process at five distinguished temperatures in 80–120 °C range, by keeping all the other parameters same (Table 1 , entries 1–5). At 80 °C, a good substrate conversion of 96 % and major product yield of 85 % were observed (Table 1, entry 1). A rise in the temperature to 90 °C led to a complete conversion and a huge increase in the yield to 95 % (Table 1, entry 2). However, a further hike in the temperature to 100 °C, witnessed a slight drop in the yield of the desired product as the formation of side products occurred (Table 1, entry 3). In an attempt to assess the effect of higher temperatures on the reaction result, experiments were set up at 110 °C and 120 °C (Table 1, entries 4–5). At 110 °C, there was a marginal decrease in the conversion to 96 %, while the yield abruptly declined to 75 % (Table 1, entry 4). Moving to 120 °C, although the conversion remained the same, the yield fell down further to 55 % (Table 1, entry 5). In 100–120 °C range, many byproducts such as 11a and 10a, 9a, 8a, 7a, 6a, 5a and 4a were evidently formed and went on increasing with every 10 °C rise in the temperature. At the extreme end of the range, that is, at 120 °C, 10a and 11a, which were resultant of the aldol condensation of 3a, collectively comprised of 25 % of the total product composition of the system, thus diminishing the overall selectivity of the system. In conclusion, the reaction saw a drop in the yield from 90 °C to 120 °C, albeit the conversion was less affected, which was due to a build-up of undesired products with the temperature surge. This system favors the formation of different products at different temperatures, but the desired product 2a was favored at 90 °C. Hence, 90 °C was selected as the most suitable temperature for the remainder of the studies. The next set of runs were performed to find out the effect of pressure on the given system in the 40–50 bar range by maintaining a constant temperature of 90 °C (Table 1, entries 2, 6 and 7). 40 bar turned out to be a mediocre pressure choice as only a poor conversion of 54 % and yield of 16 % were obtained (Table 1, entry 6). Under this condition, even the selectivity of the system suffered immensely due to the favorable production of certain side products, certainly, 21 % of 3a formed from the terminal double bond hydroformylation of carvone, 10 % of 5a and 6a generated due to the reduction of carvone's double bonds and a total of 7 % of 8a and 9a occurring as a result of the aldol reaction of 3a. Interestingly, raising the pressure by only 5 bar, that is, to 45 bar supplied the system with a spike in conversion and yield to 100 % and 95 %, respectively (Table 1, entry 2). Contrary to the poor selectivity at 40 bar, at 45 bar the selectivity was as good as 95 %, the reason for which was only 5 % composition of undesired product with a full conversion. Applying an elevated pressure of 50 bar gave a complete conversion but with a reduced yield of 89 % (Table 1, entry 7). This showed that even a pressure difference as small as 5 bar greatly influenced the reaction system, thus proving the crucial role played by the reaction parameters. It is noteworthy, that when 45 bar of hydrogen gas was present in the system, without any CO gas, only 21 % of the substrate got converted to 5a and 6a. This tells that although this Rh-catalyst brings about the hydrogenation of the double bonds of the substrate to some extent, it is not very active for hydrogenation of the C = C double bond by itself without the presence of CO under the given pressure. This indicates that the catalytic species formed in the presence of H2 as well as CO gas in this aqueous biphasic system is responsible for not only the hydroformylation of the external double bond, but also the hydrogenation of the endocyclic double bond. Taking these results into consideration, 45 bar of syngas was chosen as the optimum pressure. 3.1.2 Effect of CTAB concentration and aqueous phase volume After the optimization of temperature and pressure was done, the selected temperature and pressure, that is, 90 °C and 45 bar, respectively, were employed for analyzing the effect of CTAB concentration and that of aqueous phase volume on the reaction system (Table 2 ). To ascertain the necessity of a phase transfer agent for this process, initially a reaction run was set up without the use of CTAB. It is of interest to note that the system fared poorly in the absence of CTAB, wherein only 62 % conversion and 35 % yield were obtained (Table 2, entry 1). Also, under this condition appreciable amounts of byproducts were evident which included, 10 % of 4a that was formed by the hydrohydroxymethylation of the substrate and 17 % of a sum of 5a and 6a resultant of direct hydrogenation of carvone's double bonds, thus providing only 56 % selectivity to the system. This dissatisfactory result can be explained by the fact that (R)-carvone is soluble only in an organic solvent with no tendency to be soluble in water, the reason being the lack of any highly polar bond promoting hydrophilicity. Nevertheless, the employment of a phase transfer agent brings all the reactants to the interface for a successful reaction. Thus, the addition of an amount of CTAB as low as 4.0 μmol was made into the system due to which not only the conversion jumped to 95 %, but also the yield surged to 79 %, along with a great reduction in the amounts of undesired products, which supplied the system with a higher selectivity of 83 % with respect to 2a (Table 2, entry 2). Doubling the CTAB concentration, boosted the process to afford full conversion and an elevated yield of 95 % (Table 2, entry 3). Upon the introduction of 12.0 μmol of CTAB into the experimental setup, the conversion remained complete with a slight loss of yield as the concentration of 4a increased (Table 2, entry 4). With 16.0 μmol of CTAB, a further depletion of yield and an equivalent increment in the product of reductive hydroformylation, 4a took place (Table 2, entry 5). The inclusion of CTAB proved to be necessary to increase the interfacial area in this system through the formation of micelles. Electrostatic interactions, between the cationic group of CTAB and the Rh-catalyst carrying the negatively charged sulfonate group of TPPTS ligand, takes place as both are directed toward the aqueous phase, thus increasing the concentration of the catalyst at the interface, favoring the hydroformylation reaction. An increase in the CTAB concentration up to a certain value leads to the growth in the number of micelles, beyond which the expansion of micelles takes place disrupting the interfacial area. These experiments put forth the evidence that a phase transfer agent is inevitably required to have a selective composition of the system. Apart from that, these studies also showcase that a small amount of CTAB concentration is enough to bring about a huge variation in the results. Since, 9.0 μmol of CTAB generated the best yield, it was used for all the further experiments. The following runs were aimed at providing an insight into the effect of the aqueous phase volume on the reaction outcome. For this purpose, a volume range of 10–30 mL was considered (Table 2, entries 3, 6 and 7). With 10 mL aqueous phase volume, full conversion and a high yield of 95 % was witnessed (Table 2, entry 3). When the volume was doubled, the yield fell marginally, while tripling the volume led to a jaw-dropping downturn of the yield to 66 % (Table 2, entry 3 vs entries 6 and 7). In all the cases, 100 % conversion was obtained, but the build-up of side products went on increasing with every 10 mL increase in the aqueous phase volume. At 30 mL, the system favored the formation of 4a through hydrohydroxymethylation of the substrate, thus curtailing the major product formation (Table 2, entry 7). Looking at the experimental outcomes, 10 mL of aqueous phase was employed in the following experiments. 3.1.3 Effect of catalyst to ligand ratio and types of phase transfer agents Moving ahead, various catalyst to ligand ratios were explored. Herein, the optimized experimental parameters were used, that is, (R)-carvone (3.75 mmol), [Rh(acac)(CO)2] (0.01 mmol), CTAB (8.0 μmol), CO/H2 (1:1, 45 bar), 90 °C with 10 mL of water for 18 h at a stirring speed of 700 rpm. To comprehend the role of the ligand, initially the reaction was conducted without the addition of any ligand to the system. In the absence of a ligand, the system could not bring about the expected transformation and the reaction proceeded only to a negligible extent (Table 3 , entry 1). This made it clear that for the protocol to work, the use of a ligand was inevitable. At 1:2 ratio of Rh/L, a moderate conversion of 84 % with a poor yield was witnessed (Table 3, entry 2). This can be attributed to the inclination of the system toward the formation of 4a through the reductive hydroformylation of the substrate as the most prominent product under this condition. Altering the system with 1:4 ratio of Rh/L granted it a full conversion and a superior yield of 95 % (Table 3, entry 3). A further change in the ratio to 1:6 led to marginal drops in both, the conversion as well as the yield (Table 3, entry 4). Owing to its distinguished results, 1:4 was concluded to be the ideal Rh/L ratio. Next, various phase transfer agents were examined to test their ability to afford good conversion and selectivity to the reaction system. For this, four phase transfer agents, that is, CTAB and α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins were assessed (Table 3, entries 3, 5–7). The use of a phase-transfer agent was required for the substrate-catalyst/ligand interactions as the substrate is mostly non-polar. Surfactants, especially CTAB and cyclodextrins are the most widely utilized phase-transfer agents in such biphasic systems. Hence, the efficiency of CTAB was compared to that of the cyclodextrins. The use of CTAB gave full conversion and a high yield and selectivity of 95 % to the system. Switching to the cyclodextrins, as phase transfer agents, catered dissatisfactory results of conversion, yield and selectivity (Table 3, entries 5–7). In these cases, the conversion and yield were received approximately in the range of 50–60 % and 25–35 %, in the given order, which meant that the systems with cyclodextrin as the phase transfer agent indicated a strong aversion toward the formation of the desired one-pot process, making it unsuitable to choose them under the employed conditions. Cyclodextrins form inclusion complexes through substrate recognition, which favor the substrate-catalyst interactions making the reaction possible. The reason for the poor results of this system with cyclodextrins could most probably be the lack of efficient formation of inclusion complexes as the substrate molecule is too big to fit the cavity of the given cyclodextrins [38]. Other than that, the employment of cyclodextrins intensely favored the generation of 4a through the reductive hydroformylation of the substrate as well as 5a and 6a through direct reduction carvone's double bonds, thus retarding the system's selectivity. Consequent of the best results, CTAB was picked up as the preferred phase transfer agent for this system under the parameters employed. 3.1.4 Effect of duration of time and catalyst to ligand ratio To ascertain the relation between the reaction time and its results, runs were performed for 8–24 h (Table 4 , entries 1–5). Initially, a reaction was set for 8 h that resulted in 66 % conversion and 45 % yield of 2a (Table 4, entry 1). This meant that more time was needed for the conversion of the substrate into 3a, which in turn gets converted to the final product, 2a. After 15 h of continuous run, an almost complete conversion of 99 % and a high selectivity of 90 % were granted to the system with minor amounts of undesired products (Table 4, entry 2). When the reaction was conducted for 18 h, the system had reached a complete conversion with a surge in the yield to 95 % (Table 4, entry 3). A subsequent increment in the reaction time to 21 h catered a rather clean system with only 3 % of 4a as a side product, along with complete conversion and 97 % yield of 2a (Table 4, entry 4). To investigate the effect of a higher reaction time, a run was planned for 24 h which curtailed the yield to 90 %, regardless of a full conversion (Table 4, entry 5). The hike in the yield with time was expected as with more time, more and more molecules of substrate got converted to the product, as is evident in the time range of 8–21 h. Howbeit, the shrinking of the yield of 2a with further increase in time took place as, although 3a got converted to 2a, the latter itself got converted to the other side product, 9a through aldol reaction in a tandem fashion. These results led to the preference of 21 h as the most suited reaction duration for the given reaction system. A comparison was also made with an equivalent homogeneous system, wherein triphenyl phosphine (TPP) was the ligand (as it is organic phase soluble) instead of TPPTS and the reaction was carried out in the absence of water and CTAB under the optimized parameters (Table 4, entry 6). In this system, a full conversion was observed with 64 % yield of 2a. This showed that 2a was formed as the major product even in the homogeneous system with toluene as the solvent, however, 36 % of 3a was also obtained which indicates that the conversion of 3a to 2a was slower in this system as that in the aqueous biphasic system. The next few experiments were executed with the aim to determine the optimum catalyst to substrate ratio (Table 4, entries 4, 7–8). The ratio of 1:300 for Rh/substrate furnished a full conversion and a decent yield of 93 % (Table 4, entry 7). Working with a ratio of 1:375 gave a boost to the yield of 2a to 97 %, while sustaining a full conversion (Table 4, entry 4). The ratio of 1:450 retarded the conversion and yield to 99 % and 91 %, in sequence (Table 4, entry 8). These experiments showed that the amount of the catalyst, with respect to that of the substrate, was crucial to bring about the desired transformation in the system. The decrease in the conversion of the substrate could be due to an insufficient amount of catalyst in comparison to that of the substrate. In view of the results, the catalyst to substrate ratio of 1:375 was taken as ideal for this experimental setup. 3.2 Catalyst recyclability studies Arguably, one of the most significant benefits of developing an aqueous biphasic catalytic system is the recovery and reusability of the catalyst, keeping in view the cost of the catalyst. This is done by an feasible separation of the catalyst-containing aqueous phase from the product-containing organic phase and the former phase so received can be reused by introducing a fresh stock of the substrate. To test the efficiency of this system for recyclability, we designed a setup based on the results of this work as well as those from the literature, which included the use of an enhanced ligand/rhodium ratio [39]. With this aim, five consecutive runs were performed (Fig. 3 ). In all the runs, excellent conversion and selectivity of the desired product were achieved, which reflected the high catalytic activity of this system. The catalytic system for the one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of (R)-carvone was found to be reusable for a minimum of four consecutive cycles without a remarkable loss in the catalytic activity. The ICP-OES analysis revealed negligible leaching of rhodium (≈ 0.5 ppm) in the organic phase, which was quite minute to impact the recyclability the system. These studies prove the sustainability of this system, not only in terms of use of a bio-renewable starting material, but also in terms of an excellent catalytic activity over consecutive cycles. Reaction Conditions: (R)-carvone (3.75 mmol), [Rh(acac)(CO)2] (0.01 mmol), TPPTS (0.32 mmol), CTAB (8.0 μmol), CO/H2 (1:1, 45 bar), 90 °C, water (10 mL), 21 h, 700 rpm. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have designed a successful protocol for the one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of bio-renewable (R)-carvone in an aqueous biphasic medium. For this purpose, only a single Rh-derived catalyst was used for carrying out two varied reactions at two distinguishable remote sites of the substrate. Interestingly, this Rh complex is known to execute selective hydroformylation under the oxo process conditions, but in this case, it performed hydroformylation of the outer terminal double bond, as well as, hydrogenation of the hindered endocyclic double bond, selectively. Keeping the sustainability factor in mind, the system was created to possess the additional advantages of, recyclability of the catalyst, water as a green solvent, cost-effective ligand and mass transfer promoter; other than those of, renewable starting material, process-efficient one-pot process and single catalyst targeted dual reaction. Rigorous screening of the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, catalyst to ligand ratio, CTAB concentration, types of phase transfer agents, volume of the aqueous phase, reaction duration, catalyst to ligand ratio and catalyst to substrate ratio were performed, in order to ensure the selectivity, as the system had the capacity of forming multiple side products. Fine tuning of the system granted a high chemoselectivity of 97 % with a full conversion under the optimum conditions. Moreover, the system was regiospecific for the linear aldehyde. Above all, the catalytic system was reusable for a minimum of four consecutive runs without an appreciable loss in its activity. CRediT authorship contribution statement Rupali S.

        "dc:description": "A potent methodology was designed for the one-pot hydroformylation/hydrogenation of the biomass-based olefin, (R)-carvone in an aqueous biphasic medium, regiospecifically producing the corresponding linear aldehyde as the desired product. The protocol was made more sustainable as a result of, the reusability of the catalytic system, the use of water as an eco-solvent, the employment of affordable ligand and phase transfer agent. Moreover, only a single Rh-based catalyst was applied for executing distinct reactions at two different remote sites of the substrate. Selectivity tuning of the system with respect to temperature, pressure, concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), catalyst to ligand ratio, kinds of phase transfer agents, aqueous phase volume, reaction time and catalyst to substrate ratio furnished a high chemoselectivity of 97 %, along with a full conversion. The catalytic system could be recycled for at least four consecutive cycles without a significant loss in the activity.",
