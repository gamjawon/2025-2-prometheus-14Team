Graphical abstracts Improved selectivity of electrochemical N2 reduction to NH3 on functionalized RuO2 by ionic liquid [HOBIM]OH, which disperses RuO2 nanoparticles on fibrous carbon structure for facile N2 adsorption. Ammonia (NH3) plays a key role in the agricultural fertilizer and commodity chemical industries and is useful for exploring hydrogen storage carriers. The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is receiving attention as an environmentally sustainable NH3 synthesis replacement for the traditional Haber–Bosch process owing to its near ambient reaction conditions (<100 °C and 1 atm). However, its NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency are extremely low because of the sluggish kinetics of N≡N bond dissociation and the hindrance from competitive hydrogen evolution. To overcome these challenges, we herein introduce a dual-functionalized ionic liquid (1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide [HOBIM]OH) for a highly dispersed ruthenium oxide electrocatalyst to achieve a biased NRR. The observed uniform distribution of RuO2 on the carbon fiber and increase in the surface area for N2 adsorption by limiting proton access can be attributed to the presence of imidazolium ions. Moreover, extensive N2 adsorption contributes to enhanced NRR selectivity with an NH3 yield of 3.0 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 (91.8 μg h−1 mg−1) and a faradaic efficiency of 2.2% at −0.20 VRHE. We expect our observations to provide new insights into the design of effective electrode structures for electrochemical NH3 synthesis. Keywords Ammonia synthesis Nitrogen reduction reaction Imidazolium-based ionic liquid Ruthenium oxide 1 Introduction The electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) as a green ammonia (NH3) production route has garnered attention in recent years. This has led to significant research interest in the development of highly active and selective electrocatalyst materials. NH3 has the potential for widespread application as a hydrogen-storage medium, renewable-energy carrier, and carbon-free fuel owing to its high energy density (4.32 kW h L−1 for liquid NH3) and high H2 content (17.8 wt%) as well as easy handling and storage exploiting existing infrastructure [1–3]. For over 100 years, NH3 has been majorly produced via the traditional Haber–Bosch process [4]. This technology, however, consumes approximately 2% of the global energy output [5] and generates around 2% of all CO2 greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The increased production coupled with the widespread use of NH3 as a key feedstock for fertilizers played a significant role in the growth of the world’s population [6,7]. To overcome challenges such as the high activation barrier of the robust triple covalent bond (N≡N, ∼941 kJ mol−1) and thermodynamic limitations as exemplified using Le Chatelier’s principle [8], industrial NH3 production via the Haber–Bosch process involving an iron- or ruthenium-based heterogeneous catalytic reaction (via an exothermic process) is desired. The conversion is typically conducted at high temperatures (350–600 °C) and under high pressures (150–300 bar) owing to the use of highly pure N2 and H2 and is therefore considered an energy-intensive process [9–11]. In order to achieve a desirable NH3 yield, this thermodynamically unfavorable NH3 production process (N2 + 3H2 ↔ 2NH3, ΔH = -46 kJ mol−1) is required to expedite the alternative technology [12]. Considering the low cost and worldwide demand for environmentally sustainable production of electricity from renewable sources (such as solar, wind, and oceanic energy) and nuclear power plants, there is a growing need for electrochemical green NH3 synthesis from water and N2 to provide an alternative driving force to temperature and pressure for improving the reaction rates of NH3 conversion. Moreover, the development of a small-scale distributed NH3 manufacturing technology using a low-temperature membrane-based electrolytic system is anticipated to save over 20% of energy consumption compared to the Haber–Bosch process because of its rapid response to load variations; thus, this electrochemical approach would also allow the integration of intermittent renewable electricity [13]. However, there are two key challenges in the development of the electrochemical NH3 synthesis process (NRR: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3, E 0 = 0.06 VRHE). The first is the low catalytic activity ascribed to the near-inertness and poor accessibility of N2 molecules in liquid electrolytes (low solubility; only 0.02 g N2 dissolves in 1 L of water) [14], and the second is low selectivity owing to the sluggish kinetics of both the dissociation of the N≡N bond and six-electron transfer compared to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: 2H+ + 2e− → H2, E 0 = 0 VRHE) by water splitting [15–18]. Diverse solutions and strategies have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned challenges. NRR mechanisms have been computed using density functional theory (DFT) to gain a fundamental understanding (e.g. mechanism and adsorption strength) and to find possible catalyst combinations [19,20]. Several studies have focused on the development of metal nanoparticles by modifying the structure morphology [21], alloying [22–24], interface engineering [25], vacancy/defect engineering [26–30], and tuning the metal cluster size [31–33] to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity. One of the important considerations for biased NRR electrodes is the increment of the active area for facile N2 adsorption on the electrocatalyst surface, which provides increased possibilities for the N2 reduction reaction [34]. Moreover, the inhibition of proton adsorption can be achieved by blocking the access of water using non-aqueous media as the electrolyte and controlling the hydrophobicity of the gas diffusion layer [35–37]. However, component changes in the electrochemical cell can increase the cell resistance and further decrease the NH3 yield. For the synthesis of electrocatalysts with well-defined nanoparticles, controlling the surface charge in metal/metal oxide nanoparticles is critical. Besides traditional surfactants, the use of ionic liquids as a new type of capping agent has been proposed for the stabilization of metal nanoparticles during the synthesis process [38,39]. Fonseca et al. prepared Ir nanoparticles by stabilization with imidazolium ionic liquids and observed the ionic liquid layer surrounding metal nanoparticles using small-angle X-ray scattering measurements [39]. In addition, imidazolium-based ionic liquids were used to synthesize stable Pt and Ru nanoparticles as electrocatalysts for dioxygen reduction [40] and CO2 methanation [41], respectively. In addition to the dispersion and synthesis of metal nanoparticles, imidazolium-based ionic liquids have other important functions in energy production and storage. Yang et al. reviewed the use of ionic liquids such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Emim][PF6]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Emim][TFSI]), and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorate ([Pmim][CIO4]) for Li/Na-ion, dual-ion, Li/Na–S, and Li/Na–air (O2) batteries [42]. Another example is the use of two different imidazolium-based ionic liquids namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidozium iodide (BMII) and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) in conjunction with a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) copolymer and polyethylene oxide (PVDF-HFP/PEO) membranes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The use of such an ionic liquid-incorporated membrane led to an improved photovoltaic performance of DSSCs and a promising increase in the solar conversion efficiency of approximately 6.47% [43]. Furthermore, Zhu et al. proposed a 1,3-dimethyl-3-imidazoliumhexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF6) ionic liquid in a formamidinium-cesium lead iodide perovskite (Cs0.08FA0.92PbI3) solar cell to achieve passivation of the perovskite as the cation part [DMIM]+ of the ionic liquid bonded to lead at the surface. This could further assist in the energy barrier reduction between the hole transport layer and perovskite, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the solar cell from 21.09% to 23.25% [44]. In contrast, imidazolium-based ionic liquids such as 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [Hmim][PF6] and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Hmim][NTf]) incorporated in supported ionic liquid membranes (SILM) could improve proton transfer and increase the diffusion coefficient compared to those of microbial fuel cells [45]. Therefore, an ionic liquid with an imidazolium cation is a promising candidate for the synthesis of narrowly distributed nanoparticles and an effective NRR catalyst with increased reaction active surface. Here, we introduce a highly dispersed RuO2 electrocatalyst in the presence of an amphiphilic ionic liquid, namely [HOBIM]OH, for effective N2 reduction; Ru-based electrocatalysts are promising for effective electrochemical nitrogen reduction [46–49]. Recently, Cai et al. observed a high NH3 yield rate and a faradaic efficiency of 26% in a 0.1 M Li2SO4 solution using a surface-selenized RuO2 electrocatalyst [47]. Thus, we expect surface-modified RuO2 via ionic liquid treatment to improve NRR activity. Moreover, ionic liquids consisting of imidazole and hydroxide ions facilitate the uniform distribution of RuO2 catalysts on a carbon fiber electrode and capture protons by directly forming an N–H bond. This synergetic effect enables the increase of the active surface area for the N2 reduction and helps achieve superior both faradaic efficiency and a NH3 yield rate of 3.0 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 at −0.2 VRHE than pristine RuO2 electrode. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of the [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid 1-methylimidazole (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was allowed to react with 4-chloro-1-butanol (>85%, Tokyo Chemical Industry) at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 at 80 °C for 24 h using toluene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) as the solvent. A yellowish sample of 1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride was obtained, which was kept at 0 °C for 4 h to decant the solvent. The sample was then rinsed with diethyl ether (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), and the excess solvent was removed by drying at 105 °C for 12 h under vacuum followed by reaction with an equimolar amount of KOH (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in an aqueous medium at room temperature for 24 h. The sample was then filtered and washed several times with diethyl ether to obtain the hydroxyl ionic liquid. The remaining solvent was evaporated for 22 h at 90 °C under vacuum. Finally, a yellowish ionic liquid, [HOBIM]OH, was obtained. 2.2 Fabrication of an electrocatalyst electrode for NH3 synthesis The catalyst ink consisted of RuO2 (Sigma-Aldrich), deionized water (D.I. water, 18.2 MΩ cm), 2-propanol (Junsei), and Nafion solution as an ionomer (Sigma-Aldrich). The ink was dispersed using a ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and then NRR electrodes were prepared by a direct ink-spraying method on a piece of carbon fiber paper (gas diffusion layer, MGL190, AvCarb). Finally, the following types of RuO2 electrodes were fabricated: (i) RuO2 mixed with Nafion solution (1:0.4 wt%), (ii) RuO2 mixed with [HOBIM]OH (1:0.4 wt%), and (iii) RuO2 mixed with both Nafion solution and [HOBIM]OH (1:0.4:0.4 wt%). The RuO2 mass loading amount of each catalyst was 0.2 mgcat cm−2. 2.3 Physicochemical analysis The structural composition of [HOBIM]OH was investigated using FT-IR-4100 (JASCO) and Avance III 500 1H NMR (Bruker 500 MHz/Liquid). The morphologies and elemental distributions of the three as-prepared electrocatalyst electrodes were analyzed using a focused ion beam system scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM, NX5000, Hitachi). The crystal structures of the electrodes were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Miniflex II, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The RuO2 nanoparticles mixed with Nafion solution and [HOBIM]OH were observed using a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL LTD.). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was also employed to determine the elemental distribution in the RuO2/[HOBIM]OH cluster. The electronic state and the surface chemical composition were validated using X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) spectra obtained at the GIST Central Research Facilities (GCRF, Korea). After subtracting the Shirley background, the obtained XPS spectra were deconvoluted with fitting parameters (Tables S2 and S3). To observe the hydrophilicity of the electrodes with and without [HOBIM]OH, we determined the contact angle using a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix 300, SEO). An automatic dispensing needle was used to suspend a 1.0 µL droplet of deionized water on the surface of the specimen. 2.4 Electrochemical measurement Electrochemical NH3 synthesis experiments were carried out using an H-type cell with a three-electrode system consisting of Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl, Pine Research), Pt mesh, and the as-prepared catalyst loaded on carbon fiber paper (active area = 1 cm2) as the reference, counter, and working electrodes, respectively (Fig. S1). To prevent the leakage of gas and the produced NH3, all joints were sealed using a silicon gasket Nafion 115 membrane (Dupont) between the anode and the cathode chamber for proton exchange. The Nafion membrane was pre-treated by boiling in a mixture of H2O2 (Junsei) and DI water for 2 h to remove organic compounds. The catholyte and anolyte were 50 and 20 mL of 0.1 M HCl (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. All components were purified and prepared using an ultrapure deionized water system. Dry ultrahigh-purity Ar (99.999%, Daedeok) and N2 (99.999%, Daedeok) gases were used in this study. Before all electrochemical tests, Ar was allowed to flow for 20 min at a flow rate of 50 ml min−1, while Ar or N2 gas was purged at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1 during the test. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained, using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic, VSP), in Ar-saturated 0.1 M HCl electrolyte in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 VRHE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed to compare the catalytic activity with respect to the dosing gas in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 VRHE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out after CV and LSV measurements in the range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz at −0.2, −0.4, −0.6, and −0.8 VRHE. Constant potentials in the range of −0.2 to −0.8 VRHE were applied for 30 min in N2-saturated 0.1 M HCl for electrochemical NH3 production. Chronoamperometry (CA), as a stability cycling test, was repeated 10 times for 30 min at −0.2 VRHE. To identify and quantify the amount of as-synthesized NH3, ammonium ions (NH4 +) produced in the cathode chamber were collected from the catholyte, and the electrolytes from both chambers were replaced with fresh ones for the next NH3 synthesis in the stability cycling test. 2.5 NH3 quantification analysis NH3 collected from the electrolytes was quantified using the indophenol blue method [50]. A known amount of NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl to prepare standard solutions with various concentrations (0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μg mL−1) for calibration. 2 mL of NH4Cl solution was mixed with 2 mL of 1 M NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5 wt% salicylic acid and 5 wt% sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate (Sigma-Aldrich). An amount of 1 mL of 0.05 M NaClO (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added as the oxidizing solution and 0.2 mL of 1 wt% sodium nitroprusside (Sigma-Aldrich) as the catalyst solution. The prepared solution was incubated in the dark at room temperature (25 °C) for 2 h, and the sample absorbance was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy (Lambda 950, Perkin Elmer) in the range of 850 to 550 nm. The maximum absorbance peaks appeared at ∼ 690 nm in standard solutions. A fitted curve of absorbance depending on the NH4Cl concentration showed a linear relationship (c(NH4Cl) × 0.01178 + 0.00234 = absorbance) with an R2 value of 0.998 (see Fig. S2). We obtained the NH3 yields and faradaic efficiency of the samples using the following equations from the calibration fitted curve [51]. NH3 yield rate [mol cm−2 s−1] = c(NH3) × V / (a × t), Faradaic efficiency = (c(NH3) × 3 × F × V) / (17 × Q), where c(NH3) is the measured NH3 concentration and V is the catholyte volume. a is the working electrode area, and t is the operating time for electrochemical NH3 synthesis. F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the charge during the operation. To clarify the product during the NH3 synthesis reaction, the catholyte after the NH3 synthesis reaction was collected and analyzed using a 900 MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR, AVANCE NEO, Bruker), which was operated at room temperature in KBSI, Ochang. 10% DMSO-d6 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the samples to standardize the chemical shifts. As a reference for 14NH4 + triplet peaks, standard samples were prepared with 10 mM 14NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) by dissolving a 0.1 M HCl solution. The amount of hydrazine (N2H4), a potential by-product, was measured using the Watt–Chrisp method. A mixture of para-(dimethylamino) benzaldehyde (5.99 g, Sigma-Aldrich), HCl (concentrated, 30 mL, Sigma-Aldrich), and ethanol (300 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a color reagent. The electrolyte sample (5 mL) from the cathode chamber was added to the above color reagent (5 mL). The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 457 nm after 10 min at room temperature. A calibration curve was obtained using the known concentrations (0. 0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 μg mL−1) of N2H4 standard solution (Sigma-Aldrich). 2.6 15N2 isotope-labelled experiment To prove electrochemical NH3 production on the RuO2 electrode, 15N2 gas (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) was used as a reactant for NH3 synthesis. The electrochemical experiment setup was the same as the NH3 synthesis test which used 14N2. Prior to NH3 synthesis, Ar gas was allowed to flow for 30 min to remove the remaining 14N2 from the solution. 15N2 gas was fed at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1 during the test at a potential of −0.2 VRHE. The obtained catholyte was acidified to pH 1 using 4 M HCl in order to ensure fully protonated ammonia and extracted at 100 °C in the range of 5 mL to 1 mL [52]. Further, 168 μL of the catholyte was mixed with 392 μl of DMSO-d6 and analyzed using 900 MHz 1H NMR. 3 Results and discussion The ionic liquid [HOBIM]OH was synthesized using a modified form of the protocol proposed by Patil et al. [53], shown in Fig. 1 (a). The structural composition of [HOBIM]OH was investigated using FTIR, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Distinctive peaks were observed at 1642, 1525, 1338, 1168, and 1021 cm−1, attributed to C = C, C = C–C aromatic, C–N aromatic, C–H aromatic, and C–N stretching, respectively [54,55], confirming the presence of the functional groups of the imidazolium ring in [HOBIM]OH. The peaks at 1461 and 1285 cm−1 represented CH3 bending and CH2 rocking, respectively, of the [HOBIM]OH. After exposure of [HOBIM]OH to an acidic (1 M HCl) solution for 10 h, most of the [HOBIM]OH peaks showed negligible changes, while some peaks shifted or newly appeared (see Fig. 1b and Table S1), which might have originated from the increase and decrease in the strength of the bond length between proximate atoms [56]. For instance, the peaks at 1083 and 1027 cm−1 assigned to C–O and C–N stretching shifted to 1086 and 1028 cm−1, respectively, owing to the change in the strength of the hydrogen bond. Peaks at 1589, 1557, and 1487 cm−1 assigned to the N–H bending, N–H, and C–H bending, respectively, also appeared after acid exposure, which may be due to the interaction between HCl and the nitrogen of the imidazolium group of [HOBIM]OH [57]. On the other hand, a decrease in the peak intensities such as C = C–C aromatic stretching and C–H bending were possibly due to changes in the [HOBIM]OH concentration due to the acid treatment [58]. Furthermore, the structural composition of the [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid was also investigated using 1H NMR (ppm, D2O, 500 MHz), and Fig. S3 shows the corresponding peaks: 1H NMR (500 MHz, Water (D2O)) δ 1.36 (m, 2H), 1.75 (m, 2H), 3.41 (t, 2H), 4.07 (s, 3H), 4.11 (t, 1H), 7.21 (s, 1H), 7.39 (s, 1H), and 8.83 (d, 1H). Previously reported results in the literature indicate that hydroxyl-functionalized [HOBIM]OHs can not only serve as an electrolyte but also as a catalyst promoter to tune the catalytic reaction [59]. In addition, solvents with high viscosity and dielectric constants can improve the distribution ability of catalyst ink upon the electrode [60]. Taking the effect of the [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid on the uniformity of catalytic dispersion into account, the surface morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared RuO2 electrodes with and without the Nafion ionomer and [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid were investigated by SEM, as shown in Fig. 2 . In the case of the RuO2 electrode with the Nafion ionomer, the RuO2 particles are deposited on the fibrous carbon layer in a partially agglomerated shape, as shown in Fig. 2(a). For the RuO2 electrode with [HOBIM]OH, the morphology of the dispersed RuO2 catalyst shows a slightly lower amount of RuO2 on the electrode as shown in Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, the deposited RuO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed over the entire carbon fiber by combining Nafion and [HOBIM]OH solutions in the mixture of the catalyst ink, as shown in Fig. 2(c). A relatively large amount of RuO2 particles was deposited with a highly dispersed morphology as observed in the enlarged HR-SEM image (Fig. 2d). [HOBIM]OH affected the uniformity of the RuO2 catalyst and strongly supported the catalyst interaction with the carbon electrode, which was attributed to the low dielectric constant of [HOBIM]OH, while the Nafion ionomer acted as a binder in addition to the ion conductor. Interestingly, we observed RuO2 clusters covered by [HOBIM]OH using TEM and EDS analysis (Fig. 2e and f), and the gray area in the TEM image consisted of C and N, indicating the hydrocarbon and imidazolium ions of [HOBIM]OH. RuO2 particles are directly linked to [HOBIM]OH by forming an interface. Compared to RuO2 mixed with only Nafion solution, well-dispersed and small-sized RuO2 clusters appeared in the presence of HOBIM[OH] (Fig. S4). As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the imidazolium ion of [HOBIM]OHs was possibly adsorbed on the electrocatalyst/electrode surface via π–π interactions and/or cation-π interactions of imidazolium ions with the π-electronic surface of the electrode [61]. In addition, the hydroxyl functional group of [HOBIM]OH could be adsorbed via the π–π interactions on the surface of the electrode, while the other imidazolium moiety of [HOBIM]OH could interact with the RuO2 catalyst. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring undergoes an electrostatic interaction with the polar surface of RuO2, which prevents the agglomeration of RuO2 and enhances the dispersion and catalytic activity of the catalyst [62]. We also observed the surface charge change of RuO2 nanoparticles using zeta potential measurements in the range of −23.5 mV to + 32.4 mV in the presence of [HOBIM]OH in RuO2 nanoparticle dispersion solution, which indicated a direct linkage between the RuO2 catalyst and the imidazolium ion of [HOBIM]OH (Fig. S5). Such interactions among the electrocatalyst/[HOBIM]OH/electrode could contribute to an improvement in NH3 synthesis, in addition to the low dielectric constant of [HOBIM]OH, allowing the stable dispersion of the catalyst [63]. As described above for the proposed interaction, the RuO2 catalyst mixed with both the Nafion solution and [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid can obtain a high loading amount and a high degree of dispersion simultaneously, providing a much larger active surface area of the electrocatalyst sites on the electrode. To gain a deeper fundamental understanding of the effect of [HOBIM]OH on the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared RuO2 electrodes, C 1s and Ru 3d XPS spectra of the RuO2 electrode (RuO2 electrode with the Nafion ionomer) and high-D RuO2 (highly dispersed RuO2, which contains both the Nafion ionomer and [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid) electrode were collected, shown in Fig. 4 (a). Based on the C 1s XPS spectra of RuO2 and high-D RuO2, sp 2 C and sp 3 C appeared at 284.5 eV and 285.3 eV, respectively. The C–N peak appeared at a lower binding energy of 286 eV than C–O bonding (287 eV) due to the lower electronegativity of N. The peak at approximately 289 eV was assigned to C = O bonding [64]. The spectra from both electrodes show a large sp 2 C peak from the fibrous carbon structure. Compared to RuO2, the high-D electrode showed C–N and C–O bonding, resulting from the imidazolium and hydroxyl ions of [HOBIM]OH, respectively. To confirm the change in the Ru oxidation state by [HOBIM]OH, we collected the XPS spectra of Ru 3p instead of Ru 3d. In the XPS technique, Ru is generally analyzed based on signals from the 3d spectra; however there is interference from the strong C 1s peak in the Ru 3d spectra. The XPS spectra of Ru 3p 3/2 were deconvoluted into two peaks: RuO2 (462.2 eV) and RuOH (461.1 eV) [65]. The ratio of the RuO2 and Ru(OH)2 peak areas was 68:32 for both RuO2 and high-D RuO2 electrodes, indicating that [HOBIM]OH did not affect the surface electronic structure of the RuO2 catalyst. In addition, the XRD results showed no drastic change in the crystal structure between the RuO2 and the high-D RuO2 electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Therefore, the above analysis results reveal that there is no chemical interaction between the physically mixed [HOBIM]OH and RuO2 catalysts, as well as no significant change in the structure of RuO2. The d-spacing for the (110) plane, appearing at 27° in the XRD patterns, was also constant at 0.32 nm for both electrodes (Fig. S4c). Meanwhile, the contact angle of pure water on high-D RuO2 was similar to that of the pristine RuO2 electrode, indicating that [HOBIM]OH did not affect the wettability of the RuO2 electrode (Fig. 4c and d). The electrochemical properties of the RuO2 (RuO2 electrode with the Nafion ionomer) and high-D RuO2 (highly dispersed RuO2, which contains both the Nafion ionomer and [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid) catalysts were investigated obtaining CV curves in Ar-saturated 0.1 M HCl electrolyte, as depicted in Fig. 5 (a). The results show that the oxidation/reduction peaks for each sample in the CV curve of the high-D RuO2 catalyst are larger than those of the RuO2 electrode. This might be attributed to the higher electrochemically active area of the high-D RuO2 catalyst, and it is in good agreement with the above SEM result, which shows a higher loading amount and highly dispersed RuO2 particles after the introduction of [HOBIM]OH. LSV curves of the RuO2 and high-D RuO2 catalysts were also measured in Ar- and N2-saturated 0.1 M HCl electrolytes (Fig. 5b). The high-D RuO2 catalyst showed a higher reduction current density in both the Ar- and N2-saturated electrolytes compared to the pristine RuO2 catalyst owing to its uniform dispersion and high electrochemically active area. For the RuO2 catalyst, there was almost no gap between the current densities in the Ar- and N2-saturated electrolytes, while the current density of the high-D RuO2 catalyst in the N2 atmosphere was slightly higher than that in the Ar atmosphere in the range of −0.1 to −0.4 VRHE. This trend was observed in several studies that used a selective catalyst for N2 reduction to produce NH3 [66–68]. Considering that the NRR and HER may occur simultaneously while sharing the same active sites, the HER could be suppressed on the surface of the high-D RuO2 catalyst in the N2-saturated electrolyte in the low-potential region. Such inhibition of the HER on high-D RuO2 could be explained by the interaction between the proton and the imidazolium group in the [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid (N–H bond), which was revealed by early FT-IR results. Electrochemical NH3 synthesis tests were performed in N2-saturated 0.1 M HCl by applying a constant potential for 30 min. Based on the chronoamperometry curves as shown in Fig. 5(c), the current densities at −0.2 VRHE were found to be approximately 2.5 and 4.0 mA cm−2 for the RuO2 and high-D RuO2 electrodes, respectively. At −0.8 VRHE, the reduction current densities of high-D RuO2 (−41 mA cm−2) were still larger than those of the RuO2 electrode (−32 mA cm−2), and the difference between the two electrodes became more obvious. Fig. 5(d) shows the EIS Nyquist plots of RuO2 and high-D RuO2 electrodes at different potentials in N2-saturated 0.1 M HCl electrolyte. Both the electrode resistance and the charge transfer resistance of the high-D RuO2 electrode (33.8 and 63.76 Ω) were lower than those of the RuO2 electrode (39.58 and 126.1 Ω), revealing that [HOBIM]OH enhanced the electrochemical reactions due to its effective electronic and ionic conductivity (Fig. S6 and Table S3). To evaluate the NH3 production ability on the high-D RuO2 electrode, we carried out colorimetric-based quantification analysis using the indophenol blue method for the catholyte after a chronoamperometry test for 30 min at various potentials (Fig. S7). Prior to comparison of NH3 yield rates from the NRR, we confirmed the NH3 amount by performing a control experiment with Ar feed gas. Fig. S8 shows that a negligible amount of NH3 was detected in the Ar atmosphere compared to the results when applying N2 gas at the same applied potential, but we calibrated the NH3 yield rate from the NRR with the value from the Ar control experiment to prevent overestimation of the NH3 yield rate due to contamination sources. As seen in Fig. 6 (a), both the NH3 yield rates and faradaic efficiencies of the high-D RuO2 electrode were higher than those of the RuO2 electrode at each potential, which was attributed to the high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the high-D RuO2 electrode. However, from the viewpoint of selectivity, such a high ECSA can cause not only efficient NH3 production but also facile hydrogen evolution. Notably, the high-D RuO2 electrode showed superior NH3 yield rates in a low potential range from −0.15 to −0.20 VRHE and reached a maximum NH3 yield rate as high as 3.0 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 (91.8 μg h−1 mg−1), which was approximately three times that of the pristine RuO2 electrode, with a faradaic efficiency of 2.2 % at −0.20 VRHE. This NRR performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art Ru-based catalysts reported in recent literature (Table S5). Above −0.25 VRHE, the high-D RuO2 electrode still produced more NH3 molecules than the pristine RuO2 electrode; however, vigorous HER at high overpotentials significantly and monotonically reduced both the NH3 yield rate and faradaic efficiency of the high-D RuO2 electrode below 1.1 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 and 0.5 %, respectively [48]. This potential dependence of the selectivity of NH3 production could be attributed to the second role of the ionic liquid [HOBIM]OH in the high-D RuO2 electrode. To improve the selectivity of electrochemical NH3 synthesis, two strategies for limiting the proton transfer rate can be adopted: (i) reducing the concentration of protons in the bulk solution and (ii) the use of a protection barrier to hinder proton adsorption [69]. A proton-filtering barrier can be chosen between the hydrocarbon chain for physical repulsion [70] and metal particles (e.g., Pd) for hydrogen absorption [71]. Additionally, an efficient electrochemical reaction can also be achieved via surface modification using an imidazole group, which shows excellent proton adsorption behavior [72]. The imidazolium group in [HOBIM]OH may also act as a proton-filtering barrier by forming N–H bonds with protons, in agreement with the LSV results. As [HOBIM]OH may inhibit the access of protons to the RuO2 particles, it contributes to the exposure of active sites for N2 adsorption. To confirm the change in N species after the NRR, we carried out XPS analysis for testing the high-D RuO2 electrode. The N 1s spectrum indicated the reduction of imine (–N = C, binding energy = 398.4 eV) (Fig. S9). Quantitatively, the ratios of imine(–N = C) and amine(N–H, binding energy = 400.2 eV) were 42:58 and 65:35 before and after the NRR on high-D RuO2, respectively [73]. This indicates that some portion of the imidazolium ion linked to RuO2 was protonated by the formation of N–H bonds, in agreement with the FT-IR results in Fig. 1(b). However, a higher amount of [HOBIM]OH above 40% led to a reduction in the NH3 yield rate (Fig. S10). Moreover, amphiphilic [HOBIM]OH can act as a surfactant in RuO2 nanoparticle dispersion. Excess surfactant above the critical micelle concentration could lead to the formation of clusters, which will in turn cause RuO2 nanoparticle agglomeration and a low active area toward the NRR. On the other hand, N2H4, a possible nitrogen product, was not detected in the catholyte of both pristine RuO2 and high-D RuO2 electrodes in the range of −0.15 to −0.8 VRHE (Fig. S11). Furthermore, NRR experiments based on the electrolyte temperature and RuO2 loading amount were carried out. As the electrolyte temperature was increased from 0 to 60 °C, the NH3 yield rates were found to gradually decrease owing to N2 solubility according to Henry’s law (Fig. S12). As observed in Fig. S13, the electrode with a high RuO2 amount of 0.8 mgRu/cm2 showed a higher NH3 yield rate per electrode size [9.8 × 10−10 mol−1 s−1 cm−2], but a lower NH3 yield rate per catalyst amount [70 μg h−1 mg−1] than the high-D RuO2 electrode. This indicates that high RuO2 loading could lead to the reduction of the RuO2 active area because of agglomeration of the fibrous carbon structure. As seen in Fig. 6(b), the long-term stability test shows that the NH3 yield rate of high-D RuO2 at −0.2 VRHE was slightly reduced after the 1st cycle; however, it still maintained a high NH3 yield rate for 10 cycles. As shown in Fig. S14, the morphology of RuO2 nanoparticles on the fibrous carbon structure of the high-D RuO2 electrode was maintained after the stability test. Furthermore, the Raman spectra and XRD patterns confirm that both the chemical state and structure of RuO2 were maintained. Control experiments were conducted using isotopically labeled 15N2 as the feed gas to confirm NH3 production over the high-D RuO2 electrode via N2 electrochemical reduction, and the catholyte obtained from each NRR experiment was analyzed using 900 MHz 1H NMR, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The product from the NRR experiment using N2 has an obvious triplet (∼52 Hz), which can also be observed in the 14NH3 standard solution. The sample from the NRR experiment with 15N2 feed gas showed a dominant doublet (∼72 Hz), which corresponds to 15NH4 + and an identifiable triplet that represents 14NH4 +. Based on other studies with similar results, it is most likely due to the mixed products from 15N2, the functional group of [HOBIM]OH, and possible impurities from the feed gas or electrolytes [52,74]. Meanwhile, the different NMR spectrum of [HOBIM]OH with other products proves the absence of [HOBIM]OH in the catholyte after the NRR experiment. The quantitative analysis of the isotope labeling experiments was conducted with NMR spectra, in which the peak of DMSO-d6 was used as the internal standard [75]. As a result, the 15NH4 + yield rate of the NRR test using 15N2 feed gas was calculated to be 1.13 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1, while the 14NH4 + yield rate from 14N2 feed gas was found to be 1.25 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1. The amounts of the products from the 14N2 and 15N2 isotope labeling tests showed similar values and matched well with our 14N2 and 15N2 isotope experiments. 4 Conclusion In summary, the [HOBIM]OH ionic liquid was successfully synthesized using a modified metathesis method. This ionic liquid remarkably improved the degree of RuO2 nanoparticle catalyst dispersion when mixed into the ink solution for electrode preparation. Therefore, the ionic liquid-introduced highly dispersed RuO2 electrocatalyst (high-D RuO2) could show an enlarged active area toward N2 adsorption for a facile N2 reduction reaction to NH3, achieving a NH3 yield of 3.0 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 (91.8 μg h−1 mg−1) and a faradaic efficiency of 2.2% at −0.20 VRHE. In addition, during the electrochemical NH3 synthesis tests, the ionic liquid layer on the high-D RuO2 electrode surface inhibited the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its ability to capture protons on the imidazolium group. With the advantages of a higher active area and the ability to suppress the HER, high-D RuO2 led to significant improvement in both the NH3 production yield rate and faradaic efficiency. In addition, the NH3 synthesis performance was validated by 1H NMR quantification using 14N2 and 15N2 isotope labeling experiments, which indicated promising results. The results from using this strategy, which adopts a functionalized ionic liquid in the catalyst layer, provides new insights into the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction in aqueous media.

        "dc:description": "Ammonia (NH3) plays a key role in the agricultural fertilizer and commodity chemical industries and is useful for exploring hydrogen storage carriers. The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is receiving attention as an environmentally sustainable NH3 synthesis replacement for the traditional Haber–Bosch process owing to its near ambient reaction conditions (<100 °C and 1 atm). However, its NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency are extremely low because of the sluggish kinetics of N≡N bond dissociation and the hindrance from competitive hydrogen evolution. To overcome these challenges, we herein introduce a dual-functionalized ionic liquid (1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide [HOBIM]OH) for a highly dispersed ruthenium oxide electrocatalyst to achieve a biased NRR. The observed uniform distribution of RuO2 on the carbon fiber and increase in the surface area for N2 adsorption by limiting proton access can be attributed to the presence of imidazolium ions. Moreover, extensive N2 adsorption contributes to enhanced NRR selectivity with an NH3 yield of 3.0 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 (91.8 μg h−1 mg−1) and a faradaic efficiency of 2.2% at −0.20 VRHE. We expect our observations to provide new insights into the design of effective electrode structures for electrochemical NH3 synthesis.",
