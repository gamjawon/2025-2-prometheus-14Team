The V2O5/TiO2 catalyst is the most concerned NH3-SCR catalytic system for simultaneous removal of NO x and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs). There is an urgent need to develop a vanadia-based catalyst with low vanadium loading and excellent low-temperature catalytic performance. In this work, the Pr and W co-doped vanadia-based catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. After the doping of Pr and W, the vanadia-based catalyst exhibited the excellent catalytic activity for NO x reduction and chlorobenzene (CB) oxidation. The more abundant polymeric vanadyl species and crystalline V2O5 were observed on the PrV5W/Ti catalyst, which are contributing to NH3-SCR and CB oxidation activity. The redox capability and the amount of surface-active adsorbed oxygen of vanadia-based catalyst were improved markedly, thus promoting NH3-SCR and CB oxidation reaction on PrV5W/Ti. This catalyst is promising to be used in the muti-pollutant control reaction of NO x and VOCs.

Introduction Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from stationary sources such as municipal waste incineration, coal-fired power plant, and metal smelting caused photochemical smog and secondary organic aerosol, which are harmful to ecosystems and human life [1,2]. Among them, the chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) represented by dioxins with high toxicity and carcinogenicity easily resulted in the deactivation of noble metals and some transition metal oxides (e.g. Mn, Ce) due to containing chlorinated species [3]. Moreover, a large amount of exhaust emissions from these industrial sources usually included relative high proportion of NO x , low concentration of VOCs (around an order of magnitude lower than NO x content), and even SO2, H2O. Therefore, the conventional VOCs oxidation and adsorption technologies are difficult to remove VOCs and other pollutants effectively in these flue gasses. It urgently needs to develop an approach for the multi-pollutant control (MPC) of NO x and VOCs. Selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH3 (NH3-SCR) is a well-established technology for NO x abatement due to high denitration efficiency [4]. Currently, numerous NH3-SCR catalysts have been developed, such as V, Mn, Ce, Cu, Fe-based catalysts [5,6], among which V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity at 300–400 °C, superior resistance to SO2 and chlorine [7,8]. In addition, the operating window of vanadia-based catalysts for NO x abatement overlaps with that of VOCs removal. Thus, in consideration of technical feasibility and economic practicality, vanadia-based catalytic system seems to be the most promising multifunctional catalysts for NO x and VOCs catalytic degradation without extra capital cost [3,9]. Recently, several studies have focused on the performance evaluation and reaction characteristics on vanadia-based catalysts in the synergistic removal of NO x and VOCs [10–18]. However, in these studies, the V2O5 loading was high (> 3%) while NO x and CB conversions were still insufficient at low temperature. Furthermore, the temperature of flue gas emitted from the precipitator and desulfurization units upstream of the SCR unit in power plants or from steel, glass and cement plants is typically lower than the operating temperature of traditional vanadia-based catalysts [1]. Although the catalysts with high ratio of vanadia exhibited good low-temperature activity, high vanadia loading led to a decrease of N2 selectivity and thermal stability, and more SO3 formation from SO2 oxidation [19]. In addition, in the operating temperature of traditional vanadia-based catalysts (300–400 °C), the catalytic oxidation of Cl-VOCs could result in more formation of dioxins-like species. Therefore, the research and development of NH3-SCR catalysts with low vanadium loading and excellent low-temperature activity attracted considerable interests in the simultaneous elimination of NO x and VOCs. The redox performance and surface acid sites are the key factors affecting the denitration performance of NH3-SCR catalysts [20,21]. The rare earth metals have excellent oxygen storage and release capacity, and are widely used in catalyst modification [22,23]. Previous studies had shown that the rare earth elements could inhibit the transition of TiO2 from anatase to rutile [24]. Ce doping has been considered as an important modification of vanadium-based catalysts [25,26]. Compared with CeO2, praseodymium (Pr) shows a variety of stable oxidation states, which allow for more oxygen exchange at lower temperatures. Especially, Pr still could maintain its oxygen storage capacity during the high-temperature sintering process, which is also appropriate for VOCs oxidation [27]. Hou et al. reported that Pr doping could improve the activity and SO2 resistance of Fe-Mn/Ti catalyst [28]. Chao et al. suggested that the addition of Pr could enhance the low-temperature activity of V2O5−-MoO3/TiO2 catalyst [29]. However, there have been no research about Pr-modified vanadia-based catalysts for the synergetic removal of NO x and VOCs. In this study, the effects of Pr doping on NO x abatement and chlorobenzene (CB) oxidation (as a model compound of dioxins) of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts with low V2O5 loading were investigated. The PrV5W/Ti catalyst exhibited superior NH3-SCR catalytic performance and CB oxidation efficiency. The various characterizations were employed to explore the structure-activity relationship of the modified catalysts and the synergetic mechanism of Pr, W and V species in the process of the simultaneous elimination of NO x and CB. Experimental Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method, using TiO2 (DT51, purchased from Shenzhen Millennium Titanium Industry Co., Ltd.) powder as the support. All chemicals used are of analytical grade. The Pr-doped and Pr + W co-doped V2O5/TiO2 catalysts (denoted as PrV/Ti and PrVnW/Ti, n = 1, 5, 10, ‘n’ represents the percentage of WO3) were prepared by multi-step impregnation method. In a typical process, 2 g TiO2 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of praseodymium nitrate hexahydrate (0.0768 g), then stirred, dried, and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, to prepare Pr/Ti precursor. The PrnW/Ti was prepared by the same method using Pr/Ti and ammonium meta tungstate as precursors. Then, PrV/Ti or PrVnW/Ti catalyst was prepared by impregnating Pr/Ti or PrnW/Ti with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid. The mixed solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, sonicated for 0.5 h, then rotary evaporated to remove excess water, dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. For comparison, V2O5/TiO2 (denoted as V/Ti) and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 (denoted as VnW/Ti) catalysts were prepared by the same procedure. Among the catalysts, the loading of V2O5 is 1 wt.%. Activity tests The catalytic activities of various catalysts were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor with 0.58 g catalysts (40–60 mesh). The intake gas consisted of 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 100 ppm SO2 (when used), 50 ppm CB (when used), 5 vol.% O2 and N2 balance with a total flow rate of 500 mL/min (GHSV = 50,000 h −1). The concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, and CB were continuously analyzed by an online Nicolet IS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a heated, low-volume multiple-path gas cell. Based on the concentration of the gas at steady state, the NO x and CB conversions were calculated according to the following equations: (1) N O x c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = [ N O x ] i n − [ N O x ] o u t [ N O x ] i n × 100 % (2) C B c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = [ C B ] i n − [ C B ] o u t [ C B ] i n × 100 % Characterization The catalysts are analyzed and characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, Raman, NH3-TPD, NO + O2-TPD, NH3 + CB-TPD and in-situ DRIFTS experiments. The experimental instruments and details are listed in Supporting Information (SI). Results Catalytic activity The effect of Pr and W doping on the NH3-SCR activity of the vanadia-based catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The NO x conversion of V/Ti catalyst reached 100% only in the range from 350 to 450 °C, due to the low loading of V2O5 (1 wt.%). After addition of Pr, the low-temperature catalytic activity decreased on PrV/Ti catalyst. After the doping of W, the NH3-SCR activity of VnW/Ti catalysts was improved with the increase of ‘n’ (the percentage of WO3) (Fig. S1), which is consistent with the previous literature [30].The introduction of WO3 could inhibit the sintering of TiO2. Compared with VnW/Ti catalyst, the NO x conversion of PrVnW/Ti catalysts was further enhanced due to the doping of Pr, among which the low-temperature activity of PrV5W/Ti increased remarkably when ‘n’ was 5 (the content of WO3 was 5 wt.%) (Fig. S1). PrV5W/Ti exhibited the excellent NH3-SCR activity and the NO x conversion leveled off at 100% at 250–450 °C. Compared with V/Ti and V5W/Ti catalyst, the low-temperature activity was further enhanced and the operating window was broadened over PrV5W/Ti catalyst. Furthermore, when 100 ppm SO2 was introduced into the SCR atmosphere, on PrV5W/Ti catalyst, the low-temperature activity decreased and the high-temperature activity increased, and the deNO x efficiency still maintained 100% at 240–420 °C, indicating of the excellent resistance to SO2 (Fig. S2). The synergetic mechanism of Pr and W and the structure-activity relationship of modified V/Ti catalysts were explored in the subsequent sections. Fig. 2 shows the NH3-SCR performance with/without CB and the CB oxidation performance with/without SCR reactants on V5W/Ti and PrV5W/Ti catalysts. When CB was present in the inlet atmosphere, the NO x conversion of PrV5W/Ti decreased slightly (< 250 °C) and was still higher than that of V5W/Ti. In Fig. 2b, both PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti exhibited excellent CB oxidation activity in the absence of SCR reactants, with CB conversion of 100% above 210 °C. When the inlet gas contained NH3, NO x and CB, the CB conversions on both of PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti catalysts were significantly inhibited (< 300 °C), which may be ascribed to the competitive adsorption of NH3 and CB [15]. The CB mineralization rates of the catalysts also decreased significantly in the synergistic reaction, whereas the CO/CO2 selectivity over 80% was only at temperature > 350 °C (Fig. S3). Compared with V5W/Ti, PrV5W/Ti still exhibited enhanced CB oxidation activity in the presence of SCR gas components, indicating that the doping of Pr could effectively improve the catalytic performance of vanadia-based catalysts in MPC reaction. Meanwhile, when CB was introduced into the SCR atmosphere, the NO x conversion and CB conversion still maintain 100% at 300 °C for 24 h, indicating that PrV5W/Ti catalyst was remarkably stable during the co-catalytic process of CB and NO x (Fig. S4), which is critical for its practical application in MPC reaction. Structural properties The physical properties of the vanadia-based catalysts obtained from N2 physisorption are given in Table S1. The specific surface areas of V/Ti, PrV/Ti, V5W/Ti, PrV5W/Ti were 74.7, 68.9, 78.2 and 65.3 m2/g, respectively. Compared with V/Ti catalyst, after doping with Pr, the specific surface area decreased while the pore volume and pore size of the catalyst increased. The introduction of WO3 increased the specific surface area. PrV5W/Ti catalyst had the lowest specific surface area while exhibited the best NH3-SCR activity, and the specific reaction rate at 210 °C (based on the kinetic experiments) was maximum among these catalysts (1.280 mol·m−2·s−1 for PrV5W/Ti, 0.293 mol·m−2·s−1 for V/Ti, 0.268 mol·m−2·s−1 for PrV/Ti, 0.621 mol·m−2·s−1 for V5W/Ti), indicating that there are other factors determine the catalytic activity besides the specific surface area, which will be discussed in the subsequent sections. As seen from the XRD patterns of catalysts (Fig. S5), the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.28° (101), 36.95° (103), 37.8° (004), 38.58° (112) 48.05° (200), 53.89° (105), 55.06° (211), 62.69° (204), 70.31° (220), and 75.03° (215) are attributed to anatase (PDF#21–1272) [31,32]. Only anatase phase was detected in all catalysts, and no diffraction peaks belonging to Pr, V or W species were observed, which may be due to the low loading of Pr, V or W species or their presence in amorphous state or small crystalline size or their high dispersion in/on the catalysts. In addition, there was also no significant difference in the morphology of modified vanadia-based catalysts (Fig. S6). Raman spectroscopy Fig. 3 shows the Raman results of the modified vanadia-based catalysts. The Raman bands at 1002, 974 and 942 cm−1 are assigned to monomeric vanadyl species, crystalline V2O5 and polymeric vanadyl species, respectively [33,34]. The monomeric vanadium species (1002 cm−1) and polymeric vanadyl species (942 cm−1) were detected on the V/Ti catalyst. After doping with Pr and W, the monomeric vanadium species disappeared, and crystalline V2O5 was detected on both V5W/Ti and PrV5W/Ti catalysts, which may be due to the effective surface of vanadium loading was occupied. The amounts of different vanadium species are shown in Fig. 3b based on integration of peak areas. The PrV5W/Ti catalyst presented the maximum amount of surface polymeric vanadyl species and crystalline V2O5 species. The polymeric vanadyl species acted as the active sites for NH3-SCR reaction and had higher activity than the monomeric vanadyl species [21]. Previous studies have shown that the transformation of vanadium species occurred from crystalline V2O5 to surface polymeric vanadyl species during NH3 adsorption [35], which is the reason for enhanced low-temperature NH3-SCR activity of PrV5W/Ti catalyst. In addition, typically vanadium in the polymerized state has a greater oxidizing capacity, and the presence of crystalline V2O5 is also necessary for CB oxidation at low temperature [36], thus PrV5W/Ti exhibited the superior CB oxidation activity. H2-TPR analysis The redox properties of the samples were investigated by H2-TPR, as shown in Fig. 4 . The overlaps of H2 reduction peaks of surface vanadium or titanium species were observed at 371–440 °C [35,37]. The PrV/Ti catalyst presented two H2 reduction peaks at 404 °C and 630 °C, due to the reduction of V or Ti species, and residual bulk Pr4+ to Pr3+, respectively [27]. Compared to the other three catalysts, the low-temperature H2 reduction peak of the PrV/Ti catalyst shifted to higher temperature, owing to decreased dispersion of vanadium species, resulting in the decrease of catalytic activity. The H2 reduction peak at 777 (778) °C on V5W/Ti and PrV5W/Ti catalyst was caused by the reduction of W4+ to metallic W [38]. The H2 consumption of catalysts (based on reduction peaks below 500 °C) is shown in Fig. 4b. PrV5W/Ti showed the lowest low-temperature H2 reduction peaks (371 °C) and largest amount of H2 consumption, indicating of the excellent redox performance. XPS analysis XPS was used to analyze the valence of the elements on the surface catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5a shows the O 1s XPS for all samples. The peak of O 1s could be divided into the two peaks located at 531.5 eV and 530.0 eV, which are attributed to surface active adsorbed oxygen (denoted as Oα) and lattice oxygen (denoted as Oβ), respectively. According to the literature, Oα with high mobility could oxidize NO to NO2 effectively, favoring the NH3-SCR reaction via the “fast SCR” reaction [39,40]. After calculation from integral area, the ratio of Oα/ (Oα + Oβ) obtained and followed in order of PrV5W/Ti (18.1%), V5W/Ti (17.5%), V/Ti (17.2%), and PrV/Ti (14.8%), which is in agreement with the NH3-SCR activity. PrV5W/Ti catalysts exhibited more abundant active surface adsorbed oxygen, which favors SCR activity and CB oxidation [16]. Fig. 5b shows the V 2p XPS spectra for all catalysts. After the deconvolution, the bands at 516.8–517.2 eV and 515.8–516.0 eV are ascribed to V5+ and V4+ species, respectively [39]. The V5+/ (V4+ + V5+) ratios of all the catalysts were calculated and shown in Fig. 5b. The V5+/ (V4+ + V5+) ratios of the catalysts were in coincidence with the NH3-SCR activity. According to the literature, V5+ is the main active species in NH3-SCR reaction, and the more V5+/ (V4+ + V5+) ratio means the better SCR activity [20]. PrV5W/Ti catalyst presented the highest ratio of V5+, which may be due to the charge interaction between Pr, W, and V [26]. The W 4f XPS spectra of the V5W/Ti and PrV5W/Ti catalysts are shown in Fig. 5c. Two peaks were detected at 37.5 eV and 35.7 eV, assigned to W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2, indicating that the W species existed in the W6+ state on both catalyst surfaces [41,42]. Fig. 5d shows the Ti 2p XPS spectra of the vanadia-based catalysts. The two characteristic peaks of Ti4+were observed at 464.5 eV (Ti 2p1/2) and 458.9 eV (Ti 2p3/2) [43]. NH3-TPD results NH3-TPD was performed to determine the acidity of the catalysts. As seen from Fig. 6 , all catalysts exhibited a wide desorption peak in the range of 100 to 500 °C. According to the previous studies, the NH3 desorption peak below 100 °C, at 100–250 °C and above 250 °C were attributed to NH3 physisorption, weak acid sites, and medium-strong acid sites, respectively [44]. Compared with V/Ti catalyst, the total amount of acid sites decreased with the introduction of Pr due to decreased BET areas, while increased with doping with W due to W taken as a more acidic metal. Thus, the total amount of acid sites was in the order of V5W/Ti > V/Ti > PrV5W/Ti > PrV/Ti. The adsorption properties The in-situ DRIFTS results of adsorption of NH3 and NO x on the modified vanadia-based catalysts are shown in Fig. S7. Overall, the vanadia-based catalysts exhibited the superior NH3 adsorption capability and weak adsorption of NO x at 200 °C. The in-situ DRIFTS results of reactions between the pre-adsorbed NH3 (NO x ) and NO x (NH3) showed that the NH3-SCR reaction on Pr/W-modified vanadia-based catalysts may mainly followed Eley-Rideal (E-R) reaction mechanism (Fig. S8). This could explain the slight influence of CB on NH3-SCR activity on PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti catalysts. The competitive adsorption of NH3, NO, and CB on the surface of PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti determined by the temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiment is shown in Fig. 7 . Broad NH3 desorption bands were observed on both PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti. CB desorption peaks were not observed, which may be owing to the relative weak adsorption of CB on the surface of catalysts. The CO x desorption bands observed above 450 °C are attributed to the decomposition of organic fragments resulted from CB partial oxidation [16]. These results indicated that NH3 adsorption is dominant on both of PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti catalysts even in the presence of competitive adsorption of NH3 and CB. Compared with the results of NH3-TPD, the desorbed amount of NH3 species at medium and low temperatures in NH3 + CB-TPD (Fig. S9) decreased significantly, indicating that the NH3 adsorption was inhibited by CB, because of the same adsorption sites [16]. However, the desorption behavior of NO x was different on PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti catalysts. On PrV5W/Ti, the desorption peak of N2O was presented, which may be due to the non-selective oxidation of NH3 [15], indicating of the stronger oxidizing property. The two weak desorption peaks of NO at 100–300 °C and above 500 °C are assigned to monodentate nitrate species and bidentate/bridged nitrate species, respectively [45]. The desorption amount of NO on V5W/Ti was more than that of PrV5W/Ti, indicating the inhibition of NO by the co-doping of Pr and W, which is also verified by the in-situ DRIFTS results of NO x adsorption (Fig. S7b). The trace amount of NO2 desorbed from both PrV5W/Ti and V5W/Ti catalysts indicated that NO oxidation was significantly inhibited by CB, which was also proved by the results of NO + O2-TPD with/without CB (Fig. S10). Discussion The effect of Pr and W doping on the NH3-SCR activity of the vanadia-based catalysts was investigated in this study. Among these catalysts, PrV5W/Ti presented the highest NO x conversion at temperature from 150 to 450 °C. The catalytic activity of PrV/Ti was lower than that of V/Ti catalyst. The specific reaction rate for NH3-SCR was in order of PrV5W/Ti > V5W/Ti > V/Ti > PrV/Ti, in agreement with the NH3-SCR activity (Fig. 1). Based on the H2-TPR results, the H2 reduction peak of V species on PrV/Ti catalyst shifted to higher temperature (404 °C), which may be due to lower dispersion of vanadium species resulted from the decreased specific surface area. PrV5W/Ti showed lower H2 reduction temperature than V/Ti, indicating of the stronger redox capability at low temperature, which was beneficial for the SCR reaction. The higher concentration of polymeric vanadyl species on the PrV5W/Ti catalyst, as shown by Raman results, indicating of more active sites of NH3-SCR, improved the deNO x performance. Moreover, the ratio of surface active oxygen (Oα/ (Oα + Oβ)) and V5+/ (V4+ + V5+) increased after introducing Pr and W to V/Ti catalyst. The higher Oα/ (Oα + Oβ) ratio suggested that the doping of Pr and W can improve the oxygen carrying capacity of the catalysts, thus promoting the SCR reaction. Therefore, the low-temperature NH3-SCR activity of the vanadia-based catalyst was improved by the modification of Pr and W. The surface acidity is usually responsible for NH3-SCR performance at high temperature. The decrease in catalytic activity at high temperatures (> 450 °C) was due to the unselective oxidation of NH3, as indicated by NH3 separate oxidation (Fig. S11). The adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface is critical for the catalytic reaction. In MPC reaction, there is definitely the competitive adsorption among NH3, NO, and CB. Previous studies showed that both CB and NH3 are inclined to adsorb on the Brønsted acid sites [15,16]. Although the NH3 adsorption was inhibited partially, and still dominant, as shown in TPSR and NH3 + CB-TPD. PrV5W/Ti exhibited the better NH3-SCR activity than that of V5W/Ti in the presence of CB, possibly due to the enhanced oxidizing property. The slight decline of NO x conversion on PrV5W/Ti may be due to the NO oxidation to NO2 was inhibited by CB. PrV5W/Ti is also a candidate catalyst for CB oxidation due to the excellent oxidizing ability. In MPC reaction at 300 °C, the IR peaks of CB were still observed, indicating that CB oxidation was inhibited by SCR reactants (Fig. S12). The decrease of low-temperature CB oxidation efficiency was related to the competitive adsorption of NH3 and CB on acid sites. Conclusions The catalytic activity of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for removal of NO x and CB was enhanced by the modification of Pr and W. The PrV5W/Ti catalyst showed the excellent NH3-SCR activity and CB oxidation performance at low temperature. The maximum amount of polymeric vanadyl species and crystalline V2O5 formed on the PrV5WTi catalyst, which is in favor of NO x reduction and CB oxidation. The enhanced SCR performance of PrV5W/Ti catalyst was also associated with the increase of surface-active oxygen species and V5+ ratio. In MPC reaction, the decrease of NO x conversion was mainly due to the inhibition of oxidation of NO to NO2 by CB, and the decline of CB conversion was associated with the competitive adsorption between NH3 and CB.

        "dc:description": "The V2O5/TiO2 catalyst is the most concerned NH3-SCR catalytic system for simultaneous removal of NO x and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs). There is an urgent need to develop a vanadia-based catalyst with low vanadium loading and excellent low-temperature catalytic performance. In this work, the Pr and W co-doped vanadia-based catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. After the doping of Pr and W, the vanadia-based catalyst exhibited the excellent catalytic activity for NO x reduction and chlorobenzene (CB) oxidation. The more abundant polymeric vanadyl species and crystalline V2O5 were observed on the PrV5W/Ti catalyst, which are contributing to NH3-SCR and CB oxidation activity. The redox capability and the amount of surface-active adsorbed oxygen of vanadia-based catalyst were improved markedly, thus promoting NH3-SCR and CB oxidation reaction on PrV5W/Ti. This catalyst is promising to be used in the muti-pollutant control reaction of NO x and VOCs.",
