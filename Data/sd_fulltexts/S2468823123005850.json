Mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 was synthesized by pyrolysis and acid washing using sucrose and SBA-15 as precursors. It served as an excellent support for the adsorption of zinc acetate in acetylene acetoxylation. The content of the oxygen-containing functional group on the surface of CMK-3 was controlled by adjusting the calcination temperature, it was found that the specific activity of Zn/CMK-3 increased with carbonyl content of CMK-3 support. Zn/CMK-3 was directly blew by C2H2 without the presence of acetic acid, vinyl acetate (VAc) was still generated even if there was no external acetic acid supply, indicating that the acetate (CH3COO−) in VAc was from the zinc acetate component. XRD, TEM, TG and XPS characterizations displayed that the catalytic recycles of acetylene acetoxylation was that zinc acetate changed to ZnO after the adsorption of C2H2, and then ZnO adsorbed the acetic acid to become zinc acetate. The deactivation kinetics of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was proposed, catalyst deactivation was caused through one-center adsorption of feed species, and the loss of the active Zn component was the main reason for the deactivation of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst.

It was estimated that VAc demand would increase to 8.5 million tons in 2030 [1]. The industrial production of VAc currently was employed for two methods, ethylene and acetylene method. Acetylene method was widely applied in coal rich areas [2], due to acetylene could be easily obtained from coal resource by calcium carbide route. In the industrial application, zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2) was used as active component, and active carbon was used as support to catalyze the acetylene acetoxylation [3]. For improving the catalytic performance of Zn component, the second transition metal was used to change the electronic structure of Zn [4,5], He et al. added Co [6] and Ni [7] to Zn(OAc)2 component, the conversion of acetic acid (HAc) increased from 19.9% to 30%, and it was found that the addition of transition metal significantly inhibited sintering of active components and carbon deposition. The physical and chemical property of the carbon support could also affect the catalytic performance. The types and contents of doping heteroatoms, functional groups [8] on the surface of carbon supports could significantly affect their catalytic performance. Our previous investigation found that the boron doped carbon [9] could change the density of the electron cloud around Zn and then improved the adsorption capacity of the reactants on the catalyst, increased HAc conversion from 49% to 63.5%. The reaction kinetics and mechanism of acetylene acetoxylation had attracted much attention. Cornelissen et al. found that acetylene and HAc (monomolecularly) firstly co-adsorbed on the surface of catalyst, and the adsorbed HAc did not participate in the reaction, then the adsorbed acetylene reacted with HAc in the gas phase to produce VAc, acetylene adsorption on Zn(OAc)2 sites was the rate-controlling step [10]. B.A. Morrow believed that a σ complex was formed between acetylene and the catalyst which as the rate-determining step, and activated carbon not only dispersed the active components but also provided electrons for the catalysis [11]. However, K.B.S. Prasad proposed a quite different multiple response modeling, and they found that the coadsorption of acetylene and HAc on the catalyst could act as the rate-controlling step in the process of acetylene acetoxylation [12]. Kripylo argued that HAc was first adsorbed on the catalyst, then VAc began to generate after acetylene was adsorbed [13], and Zhang et al. proved Kripylo's viewpoint by density functional theory (DFT) [14]. According to the co-adsorption mechanism proposed by Cornelissen, the acetate (CH3COO−) in VAc might be from the reactants of HAc in the gas phase. However, the CH3COO− in VAc might be from the Zn(OAc)2 catalyst according to the acetylene adsorption mechanism of B.A. Morrow. Although the reaction mechanism of acetylene acetoxylation had been widely investigated, there was no clear experimental results regarding the source of CH3COO− in the VAc product, which caused the reaction mechanism acetylene acetoxylation was still controversial. Therefore, it was meaningful to experimentally investigate the source of CH3COO− in the products of VAc. Zn(OAc)2 catalyst exhibited poor stability for acetylene acetoxylation, the conversion of HAc could decrease from 62% to 45% during 320 h life test [9]. It had been proposed that two reasons were assigned with the deactivation of Zn(OAc)2 catalyst. In our previous investigation, we found that carbon deposition caused the decrease of the catalytic activity, carbon deposition led to the active sites embedded in the polymer from the acetylene [9]. The loss of active components was the other reason for the deactivation of catalysts, it was found that the Zn content decreased from 33.6 wt% to 23.5 wt% [15]. Unfortunately, the catalyst deactivation kinetics of acetylene acetoxylation was not investigated, which inhibited the design of novel catalyst with better stability. In order to investigate the resource of CH3COO− and deactivation kinetics in the process of acetylene acetoxylation, we used Zn(OAc)2 as the active components and CMK-3 as the support. CMK-3 was selected as support due to its high specific surface area, and regular and controllable mesoporous pore structure. Its mesoporous structure was advantageous for the dispersion of active components [16], the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of CMK-3 could improve the catalytic performance of Zn(OAc)2/CMK-3 [17]. The obtained Zn(OAc)2 /CMK-3 catalyst was employed for acetylene acetoxylation reaction, and through a series of experiments and characterization, we discussed the reaction mechanism for acetylene acetoxylation, and clarified the deactivation kinetics of this reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Sucrose (99%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, AR, 40%), were obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Sulfuric acid (GR) and glacial acetic acid (AR) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Acetylene(C2H2) was purchased from the Yantai Feiyuan Special Gas Co., Ltd. SBA-15 was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. All of the experimental materials were not further purified prior to the testing. 2.2 Synthesis of carbon support According to the previous method [18], carbon support CMK-3 was synthesized from mesoporous silicon material SBA-15 as the hard template to impregnate with carbon-source. Typically, added 2.5 g of sucrose to 8 g of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution, then added 0.15 g of sulfuric acid to the homogeneous solution and mixed well. Afterwards, added 2 g of hard template SBA-15 to the above solution to obtain the sticky mixture. The mixture was heated in the muffle furnace for 6 h with 100 °C, then raised the treating temperature to 160 °C, same with the former to keep for 6 h. The brown-black mixture obtained was ground evenly, subsequently, added the brown-black mixture powder to the mixed solution containing 1.65 g of sucrose, 0.1 g of sulfuric acid and 5 g of deionized water. The brown-black mixture was treated by the repeated same thermal treatment. Using the tube furnace to carbonize the black product for 5 h at different temperatures (500, 700, 900 and 1100 °C) in the atmosphere of nitrogen. Finally, the carbonized carbon-silicon composites were stirred vigorously in 10% HF solution for 24 h, then the mixture after acid etching was separated by suction filtration and rinsed several times with deionized water until neutral, dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and denoted as CMK-3(T), where T represented the carbonization temperature (500, 700, 900, and 1100 °C). 2.3 Synthesis of Zn/CMK-3(T) catalysts Added 1 g of Zn(OAc)2 to the 30 mL deionized water to form the precursor solution, and put 1 g of CMK-3(T) support to the above solution, stirred for 10 h at room temperature, the catalysts were obtained with drying in the oven at 80 °C overnight, which named as 15%Zn/CMK-3(T), where 15% represented the theoretical content of Zn. 2.4 Catalysts Physical Characterization The structure properties of above catalysts and supports were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipped with Cu Kα radiation and lambda = 1.5406 Å (Rigaku SmartLab SE, Japan). 2θ range of low angle and wide angle were from 0.5° to 5°and 10° to 90°. The elements content of the supports was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi (USA). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the catalysts was carried out on PerkinElmer STA 8000 in the United States, the test condition was to rise to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C per minute in an air atmosphere. The pore structure data, specific surface area and the adsorption and desorption curve of N2 of the catalyst were measured by Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument.( The pore diameter distribution and average diameter (D) of samples were conducted by adsorption following the Kelvin equation. The total pore volume (V) was derived by converting the total adsorption volume at P/P0 = 0.99 relative pressure to the volume of liquid N2. V could be calculated by dividing the N2 density under standard temperature and pressure (STP) by the liquid N2 density at 77 K and multiplying by the N2 adsorption volume under the corresponding STP condition (0.99). According to Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method (BET) and Kelvin equation in the range of P/P0 of 0.05-0.99, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the samples were calculated.) In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the supports were recorded by ZEISS Sigma 300 in the Germany. Transmission Electron images with ultra-high spatial resolution (HRTEM) were obtained using the FEI Themis Z-type spherical aberration-corrected electron microscope instrument. Zn content of the samples were quantitatively analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Agilent 5110 (OES), USA). 2.5 Catalytic performance evaluation The micro fixed-bed reactor (12 mm stainless steel tube) was applied to evaluate the performance of the above catalysts. Normally, added the 0.6 g of the catalyst to the microreactor and heated up to 180 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, liquid HAc (0.01 mL/min) was passed into the reactor after pumped into the gasification device for gasification, and then the adjusted reaction temperature to 493 K. After 30 min, the nitrogen gas was replaced by 11.11 mL/min of pure C2H2. The products were collected after passing through the condenser tube, and were quantitatively analyzed by Shimadzu GC-2014C gas chromatography. 3 Results and discussion The morphological structure of CMK-3 investigated by HRTEM was shown in Fig. S1 (a-b), an ordered structure and well-organized pores parallel of CMK-3 could be observed. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of CMK-3 sample and its pore diameter distribution curve were examined. As shown in Fig.S1c, adsorption-desorption isotherm was identified as the type IV isotherm with the distinctive H1 mesoporous structure hysteresis loop (P/P0 = 0.5-0.9) by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, displaying the obvious property of mesoporous structures. Mesoporous channels could often facilitate the transport path of gas and also could improve the dispersion of the active components [16,19,20]. From Fig. S1d, the strong diffraction peak at 0.9° corresponded to the (100) plane, and the weak diffraction peak at 1.59° and 1.8° degrees corresponded to the crystal plane (110) and (200), respectively. The low-angle XRD characterization revealed the ordered mesoporous structure within the CMK-3 [21]. Zn(OAc)2/CMK-3 catalysts with different Zn contents (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) were used to catalyze acetylene acetoxylation reaction. As Fig. 1 shown, the optimal Zn loading reached was 15 wt%, and the HAc conversion was 74%. When further increased the Zn content, the catalytic activity no longer increased with the increment of Zn loading. The pore structure data (Table. S1) showed that excessive Zn loading could cause the pore blockage of the support. The dispersion of active Zn(OAc)2 component on CMK-3 was observed from the XRD diffraction pattern (Fig. S2). Only 15%Zn/CMK-3 and 20%Zn/CMK-3 catalysts showed characteristic peaks of Zn(OAc)2. While the characteristic peaks of Zn(OAc)2 in Zn (5% & 10%)/ CMK-3 catalysts were not observed, which indicated that Zn(OAc)2 active component were well dispersed on CMK-3 support. To further explored the influence of CMK-3 property on the catalytic activity, the specific surface area and surface functional group of Zn/CMK-3 catalysts were investigated, and then the relationship between the oxygen-containing functional group of supports and the specific activity of the catalyst was established. Firstly, CMK-3 supports were calcined at different temperatures to change the oxygen containing functional group, and then loaded with Zn(OAc)2 to obtain the Zn/CMK-3 catalysts. The catalytic performance was shown in Fig. 2 a, an overall upward trend of the HAc conversion with the calcination temperature (500 °C-900 °C) of the CMK-3 support. Zn/CMK-3(900) exhibited HAc conversion of 75.1%, being higher than 63.2%, 67.8% and 67.5% of Zn/CMK-3(500), Zn/CMK-3(700) and Zn/CMK-3(1100) catalysts, respectively. It was found that Zn/CMK-3 (900) catalyst displayed better catalytic performance comparing with the previous reported Zn(OAc)2/0.5N-AC (31%) [3], Zn/0.02B-AC-900 (65%) [8], Zn/AC-30 (63%) [9]. In order to investigate whether the calcination temperature led to changes in the morphology of CMK-3 supports, the morphology of the CMK-3 with different calcination temperatures were analyzed by SEM. Fig. S3 revealed that all CMK-3 with different calcination temperature consist of aggregated, rod-type microparticles, indicating that the morphology of CMK-3 did not be impacted by calcination temperatures The specific surface area and pore structure parameters of these CMK-3 supports were summarized in Table 1 , the specific surface areas gradually decreased with the increment of carbonized temperature. The carbonization process of CMK-3 caused the shrinkage of the carbon skeleton and the pores in CMK-3 were collapsed. It was well known that the specific surface area of the catalyst would affect the adsorption capacity of the reactant gas, and then affect the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Therefore, we calculated the specific activity based on the specific surface areas, the specific activity of Zn/CMK-3 was calculated according to the following equation [22]: (1) r = q · X A 22400 · S · W Moreover, the calcination temperature could affect on the oxygen content of CMK-3 significantly. As shown in Fig. S4, three divided oxygen peaks corresponding to C=O, C-O and COOH were found, being similar with the results of the literatures [23,24]. Contents of oxygen-containing functional groups on CMK-3 supports were listed in Table 2 , the carbonyl content gradually increased when the calcination temperature increased for CMK-3. When the calcination temperature was 900 °C, the content of carbonyl group was the highest, the calcination temperature increased to 1100 °C, the carbonyl content decreased slightly. In order to elucidate the effect of functional group of CMK-3 on the catalytic activity of Zn/CMK-3, we proposed the relationship between specific activity and carbonyl content, and the results were shown in Fig. 2b. Positive correlation were observed between specific activity of Zn/CMK-3 and the carbonyl content of CMK-3 supports, being consistent with the results of previous literatures [25]. To investigate the source of CH3COO− in the production of VAc. 15% Zn/CMK-3(900) (Subsequent abbreviated as Zn/CMK-3) was used as a model catalyst in the following experimental procedure: the Zn/CMK-3 was directly blew by C2H2 without the presence of HAc reactant, and detected the yield of VAc product by gas chromatograph, the catalyst after this reaction process was named as Zn/CMK-3-C2H2. We could judge whether the CH3COO− in the Zn(OAc)2 catalyst would participate in the reaction by observing the yield of the reaction product VAc. The results of VAc yield were shown in Fig. 3 . From Fig. 3, the product VAc was still generated even if there was no external HAc supply. The yield of VAc gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, 0.02 g VAc was detected after 1.3 h of acetylene blowing, only 0.002 g VAc was detected when the reaction time increased to 9 h. VAc could be produced without the presence of HAc reactant, this was direct evidence that the CH3COO− in VAc was from the Zn(OAc)2 component. With the consumption of CH3COO− in Zn(OAc)2 component, the production of VAc decreased because less CH3COO− could be provided by Zn(OAc)2 component. Zhang et al. found similar phenomena by DFT calculation [26]. If Zn(OAc)2 provided CH3COO− for the reaction, the Zn(OAc)2 would convert to ZnO. To validate this hypothesis, we characterized the reacted catalyst Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 by XRD. As shown in Fig. 4 a, Zn/CMK-3 only presented a weak Zn(OAc)2 diffraction peak, and Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 exhibited a strong ZnO diffraction peak, indicating that Zn(OAc)2 lost its CH3COO− and converted to ZnO. The obtained Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 catalyst was blew by HAc to start the reaction of acetylene acetoxylation, and the catalyst was named Zn/CMK-3-C2H2-R. From Fig. 4a, the diffraction peak of Zn(OAc)2 was observed on Zn/CMK-3-C2H2-R, and characteristic peak of ZnO pattern disappeared after the blowing of HAc. Zn(OAc)2 reacted with C2H2 and converted to ZnO, ZnO reacted with HAc to form Zn(OAc)2. In order to further confirm the viewpoint, TEM, TG and XPS was carried out. From Fig. 4d, there were no obvious particles appeared on the catalyst Zn/CMK-3, indicating that Zn(OAc)2 was uniformly distributed on the CMK-3 support. While Fig. 4e showed obvious ZnO particles of Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 catalysts, the lattice spacing corresponds to ZnO (101) crystal faces [27], indicating that ZnO was formed in the C2H2 process. For Zn/CMK-3-C2H2-R, no ZnO particles could be observed from Fig. 4f. TG analysis of these two catalysts (Zn/CMK-3 and Zn/CMK-3-C2H2) in air condition also confirmed this hypothesis. From Fig. 4b, Zn/CMK-3 had a step of mass loss between 150 °C and 345 °C that be assigned to the decomposition of anhydrous Zn(OAc)2 into ZnO, which was consistent with the mass loss of Zn(OAc)2 [28]. For Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 catalyst, there was no step on the TG-curve because the Zn(OAc)2 on the Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 catalyst had been converted to ZnO. The XPS characterization of Zn/CMK-3, Zn/CMK-3-C2H2 and Zn/CMK-3-C2H2-R was compared. From Fig. 4c, Zn species existed in form of divalent, indicating that the valence of Zn did not change in acetylene acetoxylation. Based on these results, we proposed the catalytic recycles for acetylene acetoxylation, and a brief schematic was shown in Fig. 5 . The Zn(OAc)2 on the catalyst provided CH3COO− to react with C2H2, C2H2 obtained CH3COO− to product VAc, meanwhile, Zn(OAc)2 lost CH3COO− and changed to ZnO particles. And then, HAc in the gas phase adsorbed on the surface of ZnO to regenerate Zn(OAc)2 to form the catalytic recycles. In order to further prove the catalytic recycles, we investigated the adsorption energies (kcal·mol−1) of C2H2, and CH3COOH adsorbed separately and co-adsorbed on the catalysts to analyze the catalytic process of acetylene acetoxylation. As listed in Table S3, the Eads of CH3COOH on both Zn(OAc)2 and ZnO were much higher than that of C2H2, indicating that CH3COOH was firstly adsorbed on the catalyst. In that case, ZnO could easily turned into Zn(OAc)2 after the adsorption of CH3COOH. After the adsorption of CH3COOH, C2H2 was then adsorbed could form co-adsorption on the catalysts. From Table S3, co-adsorption Eads of Zn(OAc)2 was much lower than that of ZnO, which meaning that VAc was more easily desorbed from Zn(OAc)2. After VAc desorbed from Zn(OAc)2, Zn(OAc)2 lost its CH3COO− and turned into ZnO. Based on the excellent catalytic performance of Zn/CMK-3, we considered further exploring the stability of the catalyst, the stability of the Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was evaluated at a higher temperature of 260 °C, Fig. 6 showed that the conversion of HAc decreased from 96% to 93% after 45 h life test. The HAc conversion had only decreased slightly, meaning that Zn/CMK-3 catalyst had excellent stability at high temperatures. Therefore, in order to test the stability of the Zn/CMK-3 catalyst under more demanding experimental conditions, the catalytic activity of the Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was tested in 300 °C. As Fig. 7 a shown, the HAc conversion decreased from 94% to 49%, exhibiting rapid deactivation of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst at higher temperature. By investigating the deactivation kinetics model of the reaction, the cause for the accelerated deactivation of the catalyst would be revealed. We established the kinetics equation for deactivation based on the concept proposed in the literature [29]. This reaction kinetic model was proposed based on the mechanism of acetylene as a rate control step [10], and combined with the above deactivation kinetics equation. The calculations followed Eq. (2): (2) ( r ) = k p C 2 H 2 ( 1 + K 1 p H A c + K 3 p V A c ) where, r was the reaction rate; k was the reaction rate constant; K1 was the absorption equilibrium constant of C2H2; K 3 was the absorption equilibrium constant of VAc; p C 2 H 2 , p H A c and p V A c were the partial pressure of C2H2, HAc, VAc, respectively. The HAc conversion at every interval of 1 h was selected and the corresponding reaction rate (r) was calculated. A nonlinear curve was fitted with the data of relationship between the reaction time and the reaction rate (Fig. S5), and the fitted equation was as followed in Eq. (3): (3) r ( t ) = 3.681 × 10 − 6 t 2 − 4.356 × 10 − 5 t + 0.0021 According to the Langmuir absorption model, deactivation kinetics ( φ ) equation was derived as follows Eq. (4): (4) φ ( t ) = − 1 r 0 d r d t where, r0 was the initial reaction rate. The deactivation rates of catalysts at different reaction times were calculated by the equations. The deactivation rate data were used to establish the equations for the deactivation kinetics of the Zn/CMK-3 catalyst, as Eq. (5) shown. (5) φ ( t ) = − 0.00351 t + 0.021 Fig. 7b showed that the deactivation rate of Zn/CMK-3 gradually decreased as the catalytic reaction proceeds. Based on the deactivation mechanics equation, it could be proposed that the catalyst deactivation was caused through one-center adsorption of feed species [29]. For the purpose of illustrating the properties of the deactivated Zn/CMK-3 catalyst clearly, the deactivated Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was characterized by TG in air atmosphere. Through the TG curves in Fig S6, there was 13% carbon deposits in the deactivated Zn/CMK-3 catalyst. Subsequently, to further explore the loss of Zn on the deactivated Zn/CMK-3 catalyst, ICP-OES of the deactivated Zn-CMK-3 was compared with fresh Zn-CMK-3 catalyst, the results were listed in Table S3. Compared with the 15.2 wt% loading of Zn/CMK-3, the loading of deactivated Zn-CMK-3 catalyst was only 1.9 wt%, most of Zn component was lost in the acetylene acetoxylation at the temperature of 300 °C, being corresponded to the rapid deactivation rate in Fig. 7a. The Zn content of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst decreased from 15.2 wt% to 1.9 wt% in the catalytic process of acetylene acetoxylation. The main reason for Zn loss was that Zn(OAc)2 forms a complex with vinyl acetate, which was volatile. In addition, we increased the reaction temperature to 300°C to accelerate the loss of Zn component, so serious loss of Zn components happened in acetylene acetoxylation. Then, it could be concluded that the loss of the active Zn component was the main reason for the deactivation of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst. 4 Conclusions We investigated the impact of oxygen-containing functional group of carbon support on the catalytic activity by experimental method using Zn/CMK-3 as a model catalyst, and it was found that carbonyl group on CMK-3 had a positive effect on catalytic activity of Zn/CMK-3. The Zn/CMK-3 was directly blown by C2H2, and the production of VAc showed that the CH3COO− in VAc was from the Zn(OAc)2 component, not from the HAc reactants. There was a phase change between Zn(OAc)2 and ZnO in the catalytic recycles of acetylene acetoxylation. A rapid deactivation experiment on Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was carried out and the deactivation kinetics equation was established, the deactivation of the catalyst was the one-center adsorption of the feed species accompanied by the serious loss of the active component of Zn(OAc)2.

        "dc:description": "Mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 was synthesized by pyrolysis and acid washing using sucrose and SBA-15 as precursors. It served as an excellent support for the adsorption of zinc acetate in acetylene acetoxylation. The content of the oxygen-containing functional group on the surface of CMK-3 was controlled by adjusting the calcination temperature, it was found that the specific activity of Zn/CMK-3 increased with carbonyl content of CMK-3 support. Zn/CMK-3 was directly blew by C2H2 without the presence of acetic acid, vinyl acetate (VAc) was still generated even if there was no external acetic acid supply, indicating that the acetate (CH3COO−) in VAc was from the zinc acetate component. XRD, TEM, TG and XPS characterizations displayed that the catalytic recycles of acetylene acetoxylation was that zinc acetate changed to ZnO after the adsorption of C2H2, and then ZnO adsorbed the acetic acid to become zinc acetate. The deactivation kinetics of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst was proposed, catalyst deactivation was caused through one-center adsorption of feed species, and the loss of the active Zn component was the main reason for the deactivation of Zn/CMK-3 catalyst.",
