Graphical abstract A series of sulfur-free Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different metal Ni loading amount were prepared by impregnation method. The prepared catalysts and corresponding precursors were investigated through XRD, BET, H2-TPD, and H2-TPR analysis methods. The effect of Ni loading on catalytic performance of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated by methyl laurate catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Results indicate that the catalytic HDO performance of the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was directly related to hydrogen storage properties, hydrogen desorption properties, dispersion of the active component Ni, and so on. The 10 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the best HDO performance, and the methyl laurate conversion can reach 91.1% when the reaction temperature is 400 °C and pressure is 2 MPa. The HDO products are alkanes, such as C<10, C10, C11, C12 alkane, C12 alcohol, and C12 acid, especially. The main product C11 alkane with one carbon less is formed by decarbonylation/decarboxylation, and selectivity can reach 68.6%. The effects of reaction conditions on HDO reaction of oils were studied, for example, reaction pressure and H2/Oil ratio. The catalyst retains comparable activity upon regeneration through calcinations and H2 reduction. Keywords Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts Methyl laurate Catalytic hydrogenation Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) 1 Introduction With the rapid development of society and the continuous enrichment of petroleum-derived products, the demand for energy in global is increasing day by day [1]. However, the contradiction between social development and energy supply is becoming more and more serious. How to balance the effective supply of energy and the rapid development of society has become a pressing matter of the moment. In today's world, the production of oils is huge, which is mainly composed of animal fats and vegetable oils. At present, many researchers are interested in the transformation of oil into other functional chemicals [2]. In the recent years, bio-diesel, as a substitute of traditional fossil fuels, has attracted widespread attention due to its excellent environmental and renewable properties [3,4]. However, the first generation biodiesel, prepared with triglyceride (vegetable oil, waste oil and microalgae oil, etc.), is limited to large-scale use due to its high oxygen content, poor compatibility, and low production capacity [5,6]. Compared with the first generation biodiesel, the oxygen content of the second generation biodiesel was greatly decreased, the heating value and cetane number were significantly improved, the quality of the bio-diesel was obviously improved, and even it could be compared with the petrochemical diesel in some respects. Therefore, it is considered to be a very promising alternative fuel. Catalytic HDO of oils into long-chain hydrocarbons (C12–C24), which is also called the second generation biodiesel, with high conversion and high selectivity is the most attractive strategy [7]. The long-chain alkanes have better flow properties at low temperature, better adaptation as diesel fuels, and better compatibility with current infrastructures and engines than the first generation biodiesel [8]. At the same time, HDO technology has attracted the attention of many researchers because of its important strategic significance. It will play an immeasurable role in the energy structure system of the future society [9,10]. From the view of kinetics, high temperature and high pressure are more conducive to HDO reaction of oils. However, high temperature and high pressure can easily cause coking or carbon deposition and then affect catalytic activity. From the point of energy consumption, this reaction belongs to high-energy consumption reaction [11]. Thus, for energy and process efficiency, how to achieve the efficiently preparation of biodiesel using HDO technology under the low energy consumption has become the focus of current research. The core issue of the oils HDO technology is still the design and development catalyst with high performance. At present, the catalysts used into catalytic HDO reaction of oils are mainly noble metals (such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru) and non noble metals (such as Ni, Mo, and Co). However, the high costs limit the industrial application of noble metal catalysts. Non noble metal catalysts, especially Ni based catalysts, have been widely used in catalytic hydrogenation reactions. At present, the research of non noble metal catalysts is mainly sulfide catalysts. Inevitably, a large amount of containing sulfur pollutants will be produced in the process of sulfide catalyst preparation. This practice is not conducive to the concept of environmental protection, which will also lead to residual sulfur in biodiesel products and reduce the environmental protection performance of the produced biodiesel. Therefore, the development of sulfur free catalysts can enhance the environmental protection performance of the production of catalyst and biodiesel. Peng et al. [12] prepared Ni/HZSM-5 (10 wt.%, Si/Al = 45) and Ni/HBeta catalysts and used them into the stearic acid hydrodeoxidation. The stearic acid was completely converted and high selectivity of C18 and C17 was obtained when the reaction was under for 8 h in H2 atmosphere at 260 °C and 4 MPa. Ma et al. [13] encapsulated high concentration metal Ni into the nanopore structure of HBEA single crystal and applied them into the HDO of methyl stearate and waste cooking oil. The methyl stearate conversion reached 100% and C18 selectivity was 80% at 260°C and 4.0 MPa. Our previous work also confirmed that the Ni based catalyst which was used into ester HDO reaction showed superior HDO performance. At atmospheric pressure and 300°C, the reactants can be completely converted, and the selectivity of deoxidized products can reach over 98% [14]. In addition, the relationship between the catalytic activity and the structure characteristics, as well as the chemical composition of the catalyst was established by adjusting the load of the active component Ni and modulating of the size of the metal Ni particles. By studying different preparation methods, Ni catalysts with different structures were prepared, and the regulative methods of pore size, particle size and pore structure were obtained. It was also proved that the structure of the studied catalyst had an important influence on catalytic HDO properties [14,15]. The structural properties of studied catalysts including specific surface area, pore size, pore volume and crystal size significantly affect the catalytic performance. In the HDO reaction of oils, the large pore size of studied catalyst is conducive to oil molecules enter into the catalyst pores, the contact with the active centers can be enormously increased. Meanwhile, the large specific surface area and pore size are favorable for the diffusion and migration of the reactant and product molecules in the pore structure of the corresponding catalyst [16,17]. The commonly support materials for the loading Ni active components are γ-Al2O3, silicon and silica-alumina molecular sieve, titanium dioxide, various zeolite materials, mesoporous silicon materials modified with or without auxiliaries, MCM-41, SBA-15, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, etc. [18–21]. The high-cost zeolite supports have small pore diameters which are not desired when the reactants are bulky molecules. Also, the high acidity of these supports leads to an increase in the yield of lighter products as a consequence of enhanced cracking. This phenomenon is not favorable for obtaining target product with high selectivity [22]. When carbon is used as a support, the catalysts tend to the coke or carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. And it is not possible to regenerate via calcination, so as to the hydrogenation activity is hard recovered [23,24]. As a porous support, γ-Al2O3 has rich chemical composition. Moreover, i) γ-Al2O3 has rich Brönsted and Lewis acidic sites, which can improve the stability of HDO reaction, prolong the life length, and prevent carbon deposition. ii)γ-Al2O3 can promote the interaction between active components and support, and prevent microcrystalline sintering [25]. iii)The large specific surface area and the well-developed pore structure of γ-Al2O3 promote the highly dispersed of active components on the support surface. Therefore, γ-Al2O3 is an ideal support material in the study of catalytic HDO for the preparation of alkane compounds. In addition, the research of sulfur-free Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with high specific surface area and developed mesoporous structure for HDO of oils is very few. In this paper, the sulfur-free Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared, metal Ni and γ-Al2O3 with high specific surface area and developed mesoporous structure were used as active component and support, respectively. The effect of Ni loading on catalytic performance of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated by methyl laurate catalytic HDO. The effects of reaction conditions on HDO reaction of oils were studied, for example, reaction pressure and H2/Oil ratio. The morphology, structure, and surface chemical composition of the corresponding catalysts were studied by H2-TPR, H2-TPD, XRD and BET, and the stability of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was also investigated. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different metal Ni loading amount were prepared by impregnation method. γ-Al2O3 (Zibo New Material Co., Ltd. China) was used as the support for the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. 13.76 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O is dissolved in distilled water, after fully dissolving, adding 25 g γ-Al2O3 support, after shocking in the table at room temperature for half an hour, heat up to complete drying. The sample continued to dry overnight in a oven with 100 °C and then calcine at 550 °C for 4.0 h in air. Finally, the obtained catalyst precursor was subjected to hydrogen reduction 2.0 h at 420 °C to produce the 10 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The metal Ni loading amount of the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts thus prepared was 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 wt.%, which were labeled as 6NA, 8NA, 10NA, 12NA, and 14NA, respectively. The used catalyst is regenerated by calcinations (500 °C / 4 h) and H2 reduction (420 °C / 2 h). 2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 H2-TPR studies H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted as follows: 15 mg of catalyst precursor was placed in a quartz U-tube reactor. The precursor sample was then heated at 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C with a gas mixture of 5% H2 (Ar as balance) at a flow rate of 25 mL min−1. The hydrogen consumption was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.2.2 XRD characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern were record on a Shimadzu-6100 diffractometer with a rotating anode using Ni filtered Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV of a tube voltage and 30 mA of a tube current. The data of 2θ from 20 to 80° range were collected with the step size of 0.02 at the rate of 3° min−1. 2.2.3 BET characterization The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the catalysts was determined by N2 adsorption–desorption using an ASAP 3020 (Micromeritics USA) instrument. The catalysts were outgassed at 300 °C for 3.0 h before being subjected to N2 adsorption. The BET method was used to calculate the specific surface areas. The pore size distributions were derived from desorption branches of the isotherms using the BJH method. 2.2.4 H2-TPD studies Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD) was conducted as follows: 50 mg of catalyst precursor was placed in a quartz U-tube reactor. The catalyst precursor was firstly pre-reduced with a 5% H2/Ar mixture (25 mL/min) at 420 °C, then cooled to room temperature. After that, the catalyst is flushed with Ar flow (25 mL/min) to remove all physically adsorbed molecules. The catalyst was then heated at 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C with pure Ar at a flow rate of 25 mL min−1. The hydrogen desorption signals were monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.2.5 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic tests of all the studied catalysts were carried out in a tubular, continuous-flow, fixed-bed reactor under a certain pressure. The reactor containing 15 mL of the supported nickel oxide precursors were placed inside the tubular furnace. High-purity hydrogen was flowed downward through the reactor containing the catalyst bed, while an electronic mass flow controller was used to control the hydrogen gas flow rate. The precursors were reduced at 420 ºC at a 50 mL min−1 hydrogen flow rate for 120 min, followed by cooling under a H2 flow to the studied temperature. Catalytic activity tests were performed at temperature range of 300–400 ºC. The actual reduction and reaction temperatures were measured using a thermocouple which was directly inserted into the catalyst bed and were monitored by a temperature programmable controller at a heating rate of 5 ºC min−1. The fed was obtained by pump. The products were monitored using a gas chromatograph (SC-3000B), equipped with a FID. The conversion of reactant and the selectivity of products were calculated according to our previous study [14]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 H2-TPR studies Fig. 1 shows the results of H2-TPR studies on the prepared precursors NiO/γ-Al2O3. It can be known from Fig. 1 that two obvious H2 consumption peaks, which were recorded as region α and β, were formed in the studied 6NOA, 8NOA, 10NOA, 12NOA and 14NOA precursors. And region α belongs to the reduction of the highly dispersed NiO species on the precursors surface. Region β can be attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO species and the reduction of the NiO species in the pore structure, as well as the NiAl2O4 species formed in the process of high-temperature calcination. With the increase of Ni loading amount, the peak area and temperature of H2 consumption peak gradually increase, and the interval change is 500–520 °C. The amount of hydrogen consumption is shown in Table 1 . The γ-Al2O3 support can provide large surface area, well-developed pore structure, and abundant surface chemical sites for NiO species loading. The structural strength results in highly dispersed NiO species on the support surface. The reduction of the highly dispersed NiO species forms region α. With the increase of Ni loading, the amount of highly dispersed NiO species formed on the support surface can be increased, thus the peak area of region α can also be increased. The highly dispersed NiO species formed on the support surface can enhance the interaction between active components and supports, which can effectively promote the formation of active Ni components on the support surface in the reduction process. In addition, the surface oxygen vacancies of NiO species in the precursors have strong adsorption and dissociation ability for H2 molecules [26]. The dissociation reactive hydrogen species can induce lattice oxygen vacancies to migrate toward the precursor surface, and the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the precursor surface can control the length of induction period in the reduction process [26,27]. Unfortunately, with increasing Ni loading, H2O generated in the reduction process of NiO on the support surface can be adsorbed on the oxygen vacancies, which can prevent the adsorption and dissociation of H2 molecules, and the lattice oxygen transferring to surface sites can also be inhibited [28]. As a result, the induction period of reduction can be prolonged and the reducibility of NiO species may decrease [28]. Therefore, the peak temperature of region α is shift to higher temperature with increasing Ni loading. Moreover, NiAl2O4 species may be formed in the precursors during high-temperature calcinations. The reduction of NiAl2O4 may form region β, which can be attributed to the strong interaction between NiO species and support. Simultaneously, reducible NiO species can enter into the inner pore structure of the support to form the bulk or aggregate NiO species, which may also be reduced to form region β. With the increase of Ni loading, the amount of NiAl2O4 and the bulk or aggregate NiO species should correspondingly increase. Thus, the peak area and temperature of peak β increase. As we know, NiO species are prefer to embed into the octahedral vacancy of the γ-Al2O3 surface, thus the proportion of NiO species embedded in the octahedral vacancy can be enhanced with the increase of Ni loading amount [29]. NiO species, which embedded in the octahedral vacancy, can be reduced to metallic Ni easily [29]. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen consumption for NiO/γ-Al2O3 samples increases with the increase of Ni loading. Meanwhile, the confinement and attachment effects of the nano pore structure of γ-Al2O3 may restrict the migration and diffusion of H2 molecules in the pore structure, which may decrease the contact probability of the reducible species and H2 [14]. Thus, the reducibility of NiO species may be decreased. According to the results of H2-TPR studies, it can be seen that the highly dispersed NiO species on the precursor surface and just a part of NiO species in the pore structure can be effectively reduced at 420 °C, which can promote the formation of active centers on the surface. Unfortunately, a certain amount of NiO species cannot be reduced. 3.2 XRD characterization The prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts have been studied by XRD, the results are shown in Fig. 2 . For 6NA, 8NA, 10NA, 12NA, and 14NA catalysts, the XRD diffraction peaks of metal Ni are detected at 2θ = 44.5, 51.8, and 76.4°, corresponding to the {111}, {200}, and {220} planes of the face-centered cubic phase of metallic Ni (JCPDS), respectively [30]. Meanwhile, a series of NiO characteristic diffraction peaks, corresponding to the crystal surface of {111} and {220}, are formed at 2θ = 43.2 and 62.6° [30]. The results indicate that a certain amount of NiO species still exists in the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which is accordance with the H2-TPR results. Interestingly, only the metallic Ni diffraction peaks are obversed in the spent 10NA catalyst. The other diffraction peaks in XRD spectras belong to the characteristic peaks of support γ-Al2O3. With the increase of Ni loading amount, the XRD diffraction peaks of metallic Ni and NiO crystal become sharper and the width of half peak become narrower. For spent 10NA sample, the diffraction peaks of Ni are stronger than that of other catalysts, and the XRD diffraction peaks of NiO almost completely disappear. The crystal size of metallic Ni for each sample can be obtained by Scherrer Equation, the results are shown in Table 1. The large specific surface area and developed pore structure of the support γ-Al2O3 provide the structural strength for the loading of Ni. This strength may effectively promote the dispersion of the Ni active component and the refinement of the crystal size. Therefore, metal Ni and NiO species can evenly disperse on the support surface, the coordination and interaction between Ni active components and support γ-Al2O3 can also be enhanced. Compared with each other, the XRD peaks of metal Ni and NiO are weaker and broader in 6NA and 8NA catalysts, the crystal size is smaller. Interestingly, the XRD peaks of metal Ni and NiO become sharper with the further increase of Ni loading. This phenomenon can be attributed to massive metal Ni and NiO species spreading on the outer surface, and filling a part of pore structures, as well as coating or even encapsulating in the support inner surface. Simultaneously, the strong interaction between active components and support (SMSI) may be enhanced, which leads to the increase of crystallinity and crystal size of the corresponding catalysts. Under the high temperature reduction, H2 flow can also accelerate the migration of metal Ni species. The initial highly dispersed state on the surface can be destroyed and the dispersion of metal Ni may also decrease. As a result, the stronger XRD peaks of metal Ni and NiO are detected in 10NA and 12NA catalysts than other catalysts. After continuously increasing Ni loading, the XRD peaks of metal Ni and NiO species can be significantly enhanced and sharpened. This phenomenon can be attributed that the loading amount of metal Ni species accumulate on the surface, and Ni species may form a multilayer covering. This found may lead to metal Ni and NiO species accumulating or gathering on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the metal Ni components mainly exist on catalyst surface in the form of high crystalline and aggregation state when the Ni loading reaches a certain value. The XRD peaks with high strength and narrow half peak width can be formed, and excessive Ni species may accumulate on the inner surface. Interestingly, The Ni species with low surface energy can easily migrate to the catalyst surface at high temperature, which may lead to the corresponding species aggregating and the crystal size increasing to a certain extent [14]. In addition, based on the H2-TPR results, only a part of the NiO/γ-Al2O3 precursors can be reduced to Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts under 420 °C for 2.0 h in H2 atmosphere. For the spent 10NA sample, only the XRD peaks of metal Ni are observed, indicating that the NiO component can be further effectively reduced in the process of the catalytic hydrogenation. This phenomenon may be attributed that the higher pressure is more conducive to the reduction of NiO species, which is similar to the results from Atthapon Srifa [31]. 3.3 BET characterization The porosity of the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was studied by N2-physisorption method. Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of the studied catalysts. The N2-physisorption data demonstrates that all the catalysts show type IV adsorption isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop, which indicates that all the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts maintain the mesoporous structure of γ-Al2O3 support. The increase of Ni loading amount does not destroy the mesoporous structure of γ-Al2O3 support. The large specific surface area and developed pore structure of γ-Al2O3 effectively promote the dispersion of Ni active components. However, the specific surface area and pore volume of the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts gradually decrease with the increase of Ni loading amount, which can be attributed that the Ni species may fill in the pore structure of the support. Ni species may also effectively fill the inner surface, or even block the pore structure, resulting in the specific surface area of the corresponding catalyst decreasing. That is to say, excessive Ni loading can destroy the pore structure of the corresponding catalyst. Strangely, the change of the average pore size of the studied catalyst is not obvious, owing to the Ni components evenly dispersing on the support surface or the inner wall of the pore channel in the form of thin layer. With Ni species filling in the pore structure and covering on the surface of catalysts, the larger pore may be filled to form smaller pore structure, and the micropores may be blocked. Thus, the specific surface area, pore volume, and even the number of pore may decrease, owing to the confinement effect and the recombination of the pore structure, the pore size distribution of the catalyst has not obviously changed. In other words, it has not shown a significant rule. The pore size distribution is still close to that of support. Thereby, the tiny change of pore size is mainly due to the growth of crystal and the contraction of pore at high temperature. Interestingly, the specific surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of the spent Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst obviously decreased, which can be attributed that carbon deposits or macromolecule products may cover the catalyst surface, or block some pore structure. Fortunately, carbon deposits or macromolecule products can be effectively removed after high temperature treatment. Then the structure and physicochemical parameters of the catalysts can be recovered again. 3.4 H2-TPD studies The H2-TPD profiles of the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were shown in Fig. 4 . Two apparent hydrogen desorption peaks are formed for all the catalysts, which are marked as region α (30–500 °C) and region β (500–800 °C), respectively. The hydrogen desorption peak area and initial desorption temperature of each catalyst are distinct in the same temperature range. The hydrogen desorption peak area increases and the initial desorption peak temperature decreases with the increase of Ni loading amount. When the loading amount of metal Ni reaches 10%, the 10NA catalyst has the largest hydrogen desorption peak area between 30 and 500 °C. Moreover, the amount of hydrogen desorption for each catalyst is shown in Table 1. The hydrogen desorption region β may be attributed to the desorption of bulk hydrogen species, which can store hydrogen species and replenish the reactive hydrogen species in time. In addition, the physisorbed hydrogen on the studied catalysts surface can be effectively removed by pure Ar gas before the H2-TPD test, thus the hydrogen desorption region α belong to the desorption of chemisorbed hydrogen species. As we all know, the chemisorbed hydrogen species on the catalyst surface can be desorbed at appropriate temperature to provide reactive hydrogen species for catalytic HDO reaction [30]. Therefore, the reactive hydrogen species in region α mainly come from the splitting of the \"H-H\" bond or the \"Ni-H\" bond. At the same time, the dissociated hydrogen species may also form a new chemical bond with support after the \"Ni-H\" bond is broken, that is to say, the hydrogen spillover phenomenon. The spillover hydrogen can also provide the reactive hydrogen species for the HDO reaction [32]. By changing the loading of Ni, the supply ability of the reactive hydrogen species for the catalytic HDO reaction can be effectively controlled, mainly owing to the strong interaction between the active center and support. Unfortunately, the active component cannot effectively activate H2 molecules in the reaction system when the Ni loading is low. In other words, the cracking of the \"H-H\" bond or the formation and cracking of the \"Ni-H\" bond can be weakened. In addition, based on the results of XRD, the crystal size of metallic Ni is small when Ni loading is low. The small crystal size can enhance the metal property, as well as the interaction between dissociated hydrogen and the catalyst surface, which are unfavorable for the desorption of reactive hydrogen species. Therefore, when Ni loading is relatively low (such as 6NA and 8NA catalysts), the adsorption and activation ability for H2 molecules on the corresponding catalyst is weak. With the increase of Ni loading, the desorption amount of reactive hydrogen species significantly increases, while the initial desorption temperature decreases. The 10NA catalyst shows the lowest initial desorption temperature and the maximum desorption amount of reactive hydrogen species. In other words, the 10NA catalyst has the best adsorption and desorption properties for H2, mainly due to the rich active Ni component, suitable active metal Ni crystal size, large specific surface area, and developed pore structure. These good structural strength are beneficial to the adsorption and activation for H2 molecules of the studied catalysts. After further increasing the Ni loading, the initial desorption temperature obviously increases, and the hydrogen desorption peak area of region α decreases. This phenomenon can be attributed that a lot of Ni species can accumulate on the support surface and pore structure, resulting in the crystal size increasing. However, the larger crystal size is not conducive to expose more reactive crystal planes. The adsorption and activation capacity for H2 molecules can be weaken, and then showing relatively poor hydrogen adsorption and desorption properties. Meanwhile, the BET characterization results show that the pore structure can be blocked and even destroyed, the specific surface area may also decrease when the metal Ni loading is high, which is unfavorable for the adsorption, migration and activation of H2 molecules in the catalyst pore. As a result, the supply of reactive hydrogen species can be limited for the HDO reaction. 3.5 Catalytic activity test The prepared xNA (x = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) catalysts exhibit good catalytic HDO performance for methyl laurate. Under the function of the prepared catalysts, the reactant conversion and products selectivity are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . The loading amount of metal Ni is an important factor affecting the catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts. The methyl laurate conversion on all the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exceeds 90%. With the increasing of reaction temperature, the methyl laurate conversion decrease firstly and then increase. The 10NA catalyst exhibits the best HDO performance, and the methyl laurate conversion can reach 91.1% when the reaction temperature is 400 °C. The products are alkanes, such as C<10, C10, C11, and C12 alkane. The HDO products also contain a certain amount of hydrolysates (including C12 alcohol and C12 acid) and condensation products generated by dodecyl laurate and acetal species. With the increasing of reaction temperature, C11 alkane selectivity gradually decrease, and the maximum value is only 68.6%. While the selectivity of C12 alkane, C12 acid, and condensation products increase, the maximum value can reach 4.5, 45.4, and 14.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the selectivity of low carbon alkanes increase first and then decrease, and their value on all catalysts is lower than 15%. Moreover, methane, ethane, CO and CO2 are also detected in gaseous products (Fig. 1s). Based on the results of the above product analysis, the main deoxygenation pathway is hydrogenation decarbonylation/carboxyl in the methyl laurate HDO reaction, and the main product is C11 alkane. This phenonemon can be attributed that the small crystal size of the metal Ni can enhance the metallicity which is beneficial to the hydrogenation decarbonylation/carboxyl [33]. The CH4 in the gas products can be produced by the CO/CO2 methanation reaction on the Ni based catalyst, the hydrogenolysis of OCH3 bond in the ester group, and the thermal cracking of long chain alkanes at high temperatures. Interestingly, the cracking of long chain alkanes may also produce other low carbon alkanes, including C<10 alkanes detected in products. The C12 alkane in the products is mainly derived from the direct HDO of methyl laurate, and O atoms in the reactants can be removed in the form of H2O. Meanwhile, the formed H2O molecules are favorable for the hydrolysis of methyl laurate on the acid sites of the prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, and increasing reaction temperature can also obviously promote the hydrolysis of methyl laurate. Prior studies reported that the transform of oils to fatty acids occurred by hydrolysis in the first step [34,35,36]. Under the catalysis of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the hydrolysate C12 acid can not only further be deoxidized to C12 alcohol or even alkanes, but also produce condensation products. Strangely, the methyl laurate conversion decreases first and then increases with the increasing of the reaction temperature. This is mainly due to that the H2 molecules in the reaction system can be effectively activated at the initial reaction temperature. As a result, the amount of reactive hydrogen species in the reaction system increase, and these reactive hydrogen species can effectively participate in the HDO reaction. When the reaction temperature is elevated, the energy of reaction system can be increased, and the effective collision frequency of reactive molecules with each other can also be enhanced, which accelerates the rate of HDO reaction. However, the number of reactive hydrogen species in this system cannot maintain the need of the whole HDO process for the reactive hydrogen species, which can lead to the reaction activity decreasing. At that reaction temperature, the number of reactive hydrogen species, which are produced by the activation of the studied catalyst to the H2 molecules, is insufficient to meet the consumption for reactive hydrogen species in the whole reaction process. That is to say, the supply of reactive hydrogen species cannot meet the system's consumption of the reactive hydrogen species. Thus the catalytic HDO activity may decrease. Fortunately, after increasing the reaction temperature, the rate of the bulk hydrogen species migrating to the catalyst surface can be accelerated, and the adsorption and activation ability of the corresponding catalyst to the H2 molecules can also be enhanced. Correspondingly, the number of reactive hydrogen species in the reaction system can increase, resulting in the \"consumption\" of the reactive hydrogen species balance with the \"supply\", and the HDO activity can be enhanced [37,38]. The HDO performance of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can be obviously influenced by the Ni loading, and the catalyst structure is also one of the important factors affecting the catalytic performance. The specific surface area and pore volume of the corresponding catalyst decrease with increasing Ni loading confirmed by BET results, which is not conducive to the diffusion and migration of the reactant molecules in the pore structure. The catalytic HDO performance can be weakened. Meanwhile, the increase of Ni loading is unfavorable for the dispersion of Ni species on the catalyst surface, which may cause the accumulation and aggregation of metal Ni species on the support surface. The utilization of the reactive centers can be decreased and the structural advantage of the support γ-Al2O3 can be weakened. Therefore, the methyl laurate HDO performance may significantly decrease when the metal Ni loading exceeds 10 wt.%, and the catalytic hydrogenation activity of the studied catalysts continues to decrease with the further increasing Ni loading. Unfortunately, when the metal Ni load is low (<10 wt.%), the specific surface area and the developed pore structure of the support γ-Al2O3 cannot be effectively utilized. The amount of catalytic active centers on the catalyst surface is relatively low, which leads to the corresponding catalyst exhibiting the poor catalytic activity. The loading amount of metal Ni is not only significant affect the structure of catalyst, but also affect the chemical composition of catalyst. The number of reactive sites formed on the catalyst surface is little when the Ni loading is low, which cannot effectively activate H2 molecules and oxygen-containing functional groups. As a result, the amount of reactive species formed in the reaction system is low, and the effective collision frequency of reactive species with each other decreases, which leads to the catalytic activity decreasing. According to H2-TPD results, the adsorption and activation ability of the prepared catalysts for H2 molecules is obviously weak, when Ni loading amount is lower than 10 wt.%. Therefore, most of the H2 still exist in the form of gaseous molecules, and the content of the reactive hydrogen species in the system is low, there are not enough reactive hydrogen species to be used. After increasing the Ni loading, the catalytic performance of the 10NA catalyst can be obviously improved. This is mainly attributed to the rich reactive composition and the suitable crystal size of metal Ni, which can effectively activate the H2 molecules and the oxygen containing functional group. The 10NA catalyst contains rich metal Ni species, and the crystal size of metal Ni is relatively small supported by XRD results, which is beneficial to exposing more reactive crystal planes. Thus the adsorption and activation ability of the studied catalyst for the reactant molecules can be improved. Among of all the studied catalysts, 10NA catalyst shows best good adsorption and activation capacity for H2 molecules, which can provide most reactive hydrogen species for reaction confirmed by H2-TPD results. That is to say, 10NA catalyst has the best activation capacity for reactant H2 molecules compare with others, and effective formation of reactive hydrogen species is beneficial to the methyl laurate HDO reaction. Further increasing the Ni loading, the HDO activity significantly decreases. Based on the XRD characterization results, the crystal size of metal Ni increases with increasing Ni loading amount, and the large crystal size is not conducive to expose more reactive crystal planes, thus the HDO activity can be weakened. In summary, when the metal Ni load is 10 wt.%, the corresponding catalyst shows superior methyl laurate catalytic HOD performance. 3.6 The effect of reaction pressure Fig. 7 is the activity test of 10NA catalyst for HDO reaction of methyl laurate under different reaction pressure. The reaction conditions are as follows: H2/Oil = 500 N and LHSV: 1.5 h−1. The catalytic activity of methyl laurate is obviously affected by the reaction pressure. The methyl laurate conversion increases with the increase of reaction pressure, and the products are mainly C11 alkane, C12 acid and condensation products, as well as a small amount of by-products, such as decane, C12 alkane, low carbon alkane and C12 alcohol. It can be known from above that decarbonylation/decarboxylation, hydrolysis and HDO are the dominant reactions in the hydrogenation process of methyl laurate. And the C11 selectivity decrease, while the selectivity of condensation products, C12 acid and C12 alkane increase with the increase of reaction temperature, which indicate that increasing reaction temperature are favorable for the HDO reaction and condensation reaction of intermediate products. Low carbon alkanes including decane are derived from the cracking reaction of long chain alkanes at high reaction temperature. With the increasing of reaction pressure, the conversion of methyl laurate gradually increase under the studied temperature range, which indicate that increasing reaction pressure is conducive to the conversion of methyl laurate and decarbonylation/decarboxylation reaction. The selectivity of long chain alkanes also increase owing to the positive reaction order with respect to a certain H2 pressure which is consistent with prior reports [39,40], while the hydrolysis reaction and condensation reaction are inhibited. Besides, the crack reaction of long chain alkanes and the selectivity of low carbon alkanes increase with further increasing reaction pressure. As a result, appropriate reaction pressure and temperature is more beneficial to improving the selectivity of long chain alkanes, and the decarbonylation/decarboxylation is the main reaction to produce C11 alkane. 3.7 The effect of H2/Oil ratio Fig. 8 a–c show the results of methyl laurate HDO reaction over 10NA catalyst (the H2/Oil ratio is 100, 300 and 500 N, respectively). As shown in Fig. 8 a, when the H2/Oil ratio is 100 N, the methyl laurate conversion and the selectivity of C12 acid (main product), C12 alcohol, C12 alkane and the low carbon alkanes increase with increasing reaction temperature. At 400 °Ϲ, the methyl laurate conversion and C12 acid selectivity can reach 35 and 69.6%, respectively, and C12 alkane selectivity is only 1.3%. While the selectivity of C11 alkane and condensation product shows an opposite tendency, the maximum values are 18.1and 20.8%, respectively, at 300°Ϲ. When the H2/Oil ratio is raised to 300 N, the HDO performance of methyl laurate is obviously enhanced, and the methyl laurate conversion can exceed 60%, at 400 °C. Contrarily, the activity of hydrolysis reaction is seriously weakened, the maximum value of C12 acid in selectivity is only 58.9%, droped by 10.7% compared with 100 N (the value of H2/Oil ratio). The selectivity of C11 alkane, C12 alkane and condensation product remarkably increase, and the value can up to 59.1, 1.7, and 9.2%, respectively. When H2/Oil ratio is further increased, the HDO activity of methyl laurate is continuously enhanced, the methyl laurate conversion can reach 91.1% at 400 °C. Among all the products, the selectivity of C11 alkane, C12 alkane, and condensation products continuously increase, and the value can reach 68.6, 4.5, and 14.7%, respectively. While C12 acid selectivity tends to decrease. With the increase of the H2/Oil ratio, the HDO performance of methyl laurate is enhanced, the methyl laurate conversion can also increase. This phenomenon can be attributed to the amount of reactive hydrogen species increasing when the amount of H2 in the reaction system is increased, which is favorable for the HDO reaction. After further increasing the H2/Oil ratio, the increasing rate of methyl laurate conversion become slowly, the methyl laurate conversions are equal by and large. This can be ascribed that massive H2 molecule and oxygen-containing functional groups can competitively adsorb on the catalyst surface. However, excessive H2 molecules are not conducive to occupying more active sites. Thus, the amount of reactive hydrogen species and the methyl laurate HDO performance cannot be increased limitlessly with the increase of H2 molecule amount in the reaction system. When the H2/Oil ratio is relatively low, hydrolysis reaction is the main reaction and the main product is C12 acid. With the increase of H2/Oil ratio, the reactive hydrogen species can increase, which is favorable for the decarbonylation/decarboxylation reaction to produce C11 alkane. Therefore, the selectivity of C11 alkane increase, while C12 acid selectivity decrease. 3.8 Study on cycle and regeneration performances Catalyst reusability is important in determining its potential for practical applications. The cycle and regeneration performances of 10NA catalyst were investigated under the reaction conditions of H2 pressure with 2 MPa, H2/Oil = 500 N and LHSV: 1.5 h−1. The results are shown in Fig. 9 a–c. From Fig. 9 a, we can see that fresh Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows superior methyl laurate HDO performance, the methyl laurate conversion can reach 91.1% at 400 °C. The products are C<10, C10, C11, and C12 alkane. At the same time, hydrolysis product (such as C12 alcohol and C12 acid) and condensation product are also detected. With the increase of reaction temperature, C11 alkane selectivity decrease, while the selectivity of C12 alkane, C12 acid and condensation product increase, their maximum value are 68.6, 4.5, 45.4, and 14.1%, respectively. Among all products, the selectivity of C<10 alkane always less than 15%. Besides, methyl laurate HDO activity evidently decrease in the second cycle and the maximum value of methyl laurate conversion is only 53.1%. The main product is C12 acid, and the C12 acid selectivity can reach 65%. The selectivity of C11 alkane obtained by decarbonylation/decarboxylation can only reach 28.1%. By-products contain C<10, C10, C12 alkane, a few of C12 alcohol and condensation product. Fortunately, after the used Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst regenerated, the catalytic activity was recovered in a certain extent. The methyl laurate conversion can reach 72.9% at 400 °C, and the highest selectivity of C11 alkane is up to 67.5%. The specific surface area of corresponding catalyst can decrease and the pore structure can be blocked confirmed by BET result, owing to carbon deposition or macromolecule condensation product covering on the catalyst surface. This phenomenon is not conducive to the diffusion, migration and activation of reactant molecules. Thus, the methyl laurate HDO performance decreases. Meanwhile, hydrogenation reactive site may be covered, which can lead to the number of the reactive centers decreasing so as to inhibit catalytic performances. As the XRD results, the content of metal Ni species increases, and the NiO content is relatively low. At the same time, the crystal size of metal Ni increase, which can be attributed to metal Ni microcrystalline sintering, and larger crystal size is not conducive to exposing more reactive planes. Therefore, hydrogenation activity is hard recovered. Fortunately, the catalytic HDO activity can be recovered by high temperature calcinations and H2 reduction for the used Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the recovery of the physicochemical properties after calcinations and H2 reduction for the used Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It is known by BET results that the specific surface area and the developed pore structure of the regenerated catalyst can be recovered, which is beneficial to the migration, diffusion, adsorption, and activation of the reactant molecules in the pore structure. At the same time, after calcinations, the carbon deposition and the macromolecular species on the surface of the active metal can be effectively removed, which is beneficial to expose active crystal surface, thus improving the catalytic HDO performance [31]. However, the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalyst did not completely recover to that of the fresh catalyst, mainly due to the loss of the reactive species and the sintering of the active metal during the heat treatment process. 4 Conclusions The prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can maintain the developed mesoporous structure of γ-Al2O3 and have a large specific surface area, which can reach 158 m2/g. With the increasing metal Ni loading, the specific surface area, pore volume, and the dispersion of the metal Ni decreased, while the crystal size increased. The prepared Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts have good adsorption and activation ability for H2 molecules. The maximum value of chemical adsorption hydrogen species can reach 6.67 mmol/g when the Ni loading amount is 10 wt.%. In addition, the 10 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the best HDO performance, and the methyl laurate conversion can reach 91.1% when the reaction temperature is 400 °C, reaction pressure is 2 MPa, H2/Oil is 500 N, and LHSV is 1.5 h−1. The HDO products are alkanes, such as C<10, C10, C11, C12 alkane, C12 alcohol, and C12 acid, especially, the main product C11 alkane selectivity can reach 68.6%. Increasing reaction pressure and H2/Oil are conducive to decarbonylation/decarboxylation reaction to produce C11 alkane. Meanwhile, the selectivity of long chain alkanes also increases, while the hydrolysis reaction and condensation reaction are inhibited. What’s more, the main reason for the deactivation of the studied catalyst is the carbon deposition. The catalyst retains comparable activity upon regeneration through calcinations and H2 reduction.
