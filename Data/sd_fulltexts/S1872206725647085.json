Graphical Abstract Focusing on the electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules, this comment aims to uncover the scientific issues underlying current bottlenecks in electrosynthesis technologies, while exploring the challenges and opportunities from laboratory innovations to large-scale industrial applications. Keywords Electrosynthesis Hydrogen energy Value-added chemicals Energy conversion Reaction engineering 1 Introduction The electrochemical synthesis of value-added chemicals has emerged as a transformative technology platform that synergistically addresses scientific, industrial, and ecological imperatives. This innovative paradigm utilizes electrical energy to activate molecular transformations, converting abundant feedstocks, including water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), and oxygen (O2), into premium chemical products such as synthetic fuels, pharmaceutical precursors, and specialty materials [1–4]. Distinct from conventional thermochemical processes requiring energy-intensive high-pressure/temperature conditions, electrochemical systems typically operate under ambient conditions with superior energy efficiency. There are critical advantages define this technological revolution. Firstly, the integration with renewable electricity enables carbon-neutral production cycles. For instance, water electrolysis generates only hydrogen and oxygen without secondary pollution. Additionally, it decouples chemical manufacturing from fossil fuel dependence by establishing electricity-to-chemicals pathways, effectively reducing the carbon footprint of chemical industries compared with conventional methods [5]. Moreover, the technology provides grid-stabilizing solutions through chemical energy storage (such as methanol/ammonia synthesis), converting intermittent renewable energy into transportable liquid fuels that transcend geographical limitations of power transmission. Recent progress has expanded applications beyond energy carriers to high-margin products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates requiring precise stereochemical control, ultra-pure electronic-grade reagents for semiconductor manufacturing, and advanced polymeric materials with tailored functionalities [6,7]. From a systematic perspective, electrochemical synthesis serves as a critical nexus connecting renewable energy infrastructure with sustainable chemical production. The technology’s dual function in energy conversion and chemical manufacturing positions it as a cornerstone for circular economy implementation. In this context, we focus on the analysis of the emerging strategies in small molecule activation (CO2, N2, H2O and O2) while looking ahead to the challenges for translating electrochemical technologies from laboratory innovation to chemical industry transformation. Ultimately, the hope is expected on establishing electrically driven chemical plants that simultaneously achieve net-negative emissions, energy resilience, and economic competitiveness. 2 Chemicals for storing renewable energy Fig. 1 illustrates potential sustainable pathways for producing critical fuels and compounds, including hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenated derivatives, and ammonia, as alternatives to energy-intensive conventional industrial processes. Natural components such as CO2, N2, H2O and O2 serve as readily available raw materials. These can be electrochemically converted into desired end-products through renewable energy-driven processes enabled by innovative catalysts. Sustainable hydrogen production via H2O electrolysis has attracted global research interest due to its potential to decarbonize industries ranging from transportation to steel manufacturing [8]. While hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier with high gravimetric energy density for clean power generation in fuel cells, its low volumetric energy density and cryogenic storage requirements pose significant challenges in storage and transportation [9]. This has spurred interest in alternative hydrogen carriers. Carbon-based carriers derived from CO2 reduction, including fuels, fine chemicals and polymer precursors, offer promising solutions. Notably, liquid products such as methanol, ethanol and formic acid serve as versatile carbon-based hydrogen carriers, enabling closed-loop carbon cycles through their utilization in direct organic fuel cells [10]. Meanwhile, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide emerge as popular carbon-free hydrogen carriers. Ammonia, a cornerstone of agricultural and industrial production, can be sustainably synthesized via electrochemical nitrogen reduction. This method not only bypasses the distribution challenges inherent to centralized Haber-Bosch infrastructure but also circumvents the intrinsic biological limitations of traditional bio-based nitrogen fixation systems. By enabling modular production powered by renewable energy, electrochemical synthesis offers a highly scalable and renewable pathway to nitrogen utilization, aligning with global decarbonization goals while addressing both logistical and ecological constraints of conventional technologies [11]. Hydrogen peroxide, essential for disinfection, paper bleaching, and water treatment, can be on-site generated through the oxygen reduction reaction with two-electron transfer process [12]. While electrolytic hydrogen production technology is maturing and demonstrating economic viability through declining electricity and electrolyzer costs (compared to gray/blue hydrogen), other electrochemical processes such as nitrogen fixation and hydrocarbon synthesis remain economically challenging. Even with battery storage costs projected to fall below 100000 $ MWh–1 by 2050 [13], system-level costs remain prohibitive. For instance, in the continuous production of 1 tonne of ammonia per day with an energy efficiency of 60% (approximately 8.8 MWh t-1), a purely solar-powered system would necessitate 18 hours of daily energy storage (6.6 MWh). Based on the anticipated median battery cost of 200000 $ MWh–1, this translates to 1.2 million $ t–1 in daily storage costs (annualized 3,300 $ t–1)-doubling current capital intensity benchmarks (1000–1500 $ t–1) for energy-intensive industrial processes [14]. Therefore, the realization of this technological vision necessitates achieving transformative advancements in system-level energy conversion efficiencies while establishing robust pathways to translate laboratory innovations into industrially viable solutions. 3 Improving the energy conversion efficiency The successful realization of high-yield electrosynthesis depends on enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of electrolytic systems—an intricate engineering challenge that spans hierarchical scales, from the precise design of catalysts at the atomic level to the seamless integration of processes at the macroscopic level (Fig. 2 ). Central to this effort is the rational design and scalable production of high-performance catalysts tailored for both cathodic and anodic reactions. A comprehensive evaluation of catalytic performance must balance four critical parameters: economic viability, intrinsic activity, product selectivity, and operational durability. While traditional catalyst development relies on extensive trial-and-error experimentation, emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted screening platforms now dramatically accelerate the discovery cycle by predicting structure-activity relationships [15]. However, the following challenges must also be addressed, including the insufficient availability of standardized and high-fidelity datasets, the inherent complexity of integrating multi-scale data spanning atomic-level simulations to macroscopic performance metrics, and structural deficiencies in predictive model architectures that limit their generalizability to dynamic catalytic environments [16]. A fundamental challenge lies in the dynamic evolution of catalyst structures under operational conditions. Pre-characterized catalyst morphologies often differ from the true active species forming during electrochemical processes, necessitating advanced in situ or operando monitoring techniques to identify real catalytic centers and elucidate reaction mechanisms [17]. Atomic-level insights into these transient structural changes are indispensable for guiding catalyst optimization. Nevertheless, current methodologies remain constrained by critical operational limitations, such as compromised spatiotemporal resolution (impairing the detection of ultrafast interfacial dynamics), and persistent signal artifacts arising from complex electrochemical conditions. These limitations underscore both challenges and opportunities for advancing next-generation in situ characterization techniques, particularly in achieving extreme-condition compatibility and cross-scale analytical integration. Mass transfer limitations further complicate system efficiency, particularly for gas-involving reactions. Gas diffusion electrodes, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-modified hydrophobic carbon matrices, with engineered hydrophobicity gradients address this by establishing distinct zones for gas permeation (hydrophobic domains) and ion transport (hydrophilic interfaces) [18]. Such architectures enhance triple-phase boundary interactions while mitigating electrowetting effects under high current densities (>500 mA cm–2) [19]. However, maintaining stable interfacial properties during prolonged operation remains a significant hurdle. Electrolyte engineering critically influences reaction kinetics through proton/electron coupling dynamics. Optimal electrolyte selection—whether acidic, alkaline, or non-aqueous—must suppress parasitic reactions while promoting target pathways. For instance, alkaline electrolytes effectively inhibit hydrogen evolution in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction, while Li+ additives strengthen N2 adsorption [20]. Additionally, the introduction of quaternary ammonium salt cationic surfactants in the electrolytes, as a proton transport inhibitor, greatly improves the selectivity for hydrogen peroxide in the oxygen reduction reaction [21]. Therefore, comprehensive mass transfer analysis must extend beyond gaseous species diffusion to explicitly account for proton mobility constraints in complex electrolytes, interfacial charge transfer resistance at catalytic surfaces, and their collective impact on reaction pathway selectivity. This multidimensional approach is particularly crucial for optimizing systems where product distribution depends critically on local proton activity and electronic state modulation. Membrane technology also plays a pivotal role, where advanced alternatives to commercial Nafion membranes must reconcile competing demands: high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and cost-effectiveness, which is a balance yet to be achieved [22]. System-level energy efficiency extends beyond electricity costs to anode process optimization. Conventional oxygen evolution reactions (OER) impose substantial energy penalties due to sluggish kinetics [23,24]. Innovative approaches now prioritize coupling cathodic CO2/N2 reduction with value-added anodic oxidations (such as organics conversion), exploiting reactions with lower theoretical potentials than OER [25]. This dual-output strategy simultaneously reduces voltage requirements and generates premium co-products, effectively transforming electrochemical reactors into multi-product synthetic platforms. Meanwhile, critical factors must be considered under practical high-current electrochemical conditions, including rigorous suppression of competing oxygen evolution reactions, mitigation of electrolyte corrosion and cell component degradation, and development of efficient product separation/collection systems. These challenges collectively necessitate more sophisticated electrolyzer configurations and operational protocols compared to conventional water electrolysis systems. Fundamentally, enhancing energy conversion efficiency necessitates a multiscale engineering framework that synergistically integrates rational catalyst design, optimized transport dynamics, tailored electrolyte systems, advanced membrane architectures, and the strategic integration of value-added anodic reactions. 4 Challenges and opportunities in industry Transitioning electrosynthesis technologies from laboratory breakthroughs to industrial implementation demands radical advancements that transcend conventional research metrics. Beyond achieving fundamental scientific validation, next-generation electrolysis systems must deliver unprecedented economic and operational performance (Fig. 3 ). Achieving industrial-scale viability for electrolysis systems requires comprehensive optimization across multiple device components. Strategic materials selection, coupled with advanced manufacturing techniques like 3D printing [26,27], enables drastic cost reduction through minimized catalyst loadings and simplified structural architectures. Simultaneously, operational longevity should be up to tens of thousands of hours under continuous service, which is a target demanding revolutionary materials durability. This necessitates developing corrosion-resistant membranes and fatigue-tolerant electrodes capable of withstanding prolonged electrochemical stresses. Current densities must surpass laboratory benchmarks (>1 A cm–2) through synergistic engineering: highly active/selective catalysts paired with low-resistance cell architectures featuring optimized electrode geometries and ionomer distributions [28]. A key example is the EU Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Venture’s 2030 roadmap targeting proton exchange membrane (PEM) current densities exceeding 2.5 A cm–2 [29]. Driven by such short-term goals, the gradual introduction of multi-disciplinary joint guidance of industrial integration and intelligent supervision can further accelerate the long-term development process to achieve a fully autonomous long-cycle electrolytic system. However, scale-up introduces emergent challenges, such as increased parasitic reactions at elevated current densities. For example, the two-electron oxygen reduction pathway for hydrogen peroxide production faces intensified competition from parasitic reactions at elevated current densities [30]. This arises from two concurrent effects, including the increased overpotential pushes the operating window into the thermodynamic region favoring the four-electron pathway (4e–-ORR), which dominantly produces water, and accelerated ion transport under high current conditions amplifies interfacial pH gradients, further destabilizing the desired 2e– reaction mechanism [31]. Additionally, the high current density may also cause the potential interval to cross the electrolytic water reaction, thereby inducing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Mitigating these effects requires precision engineering of gas diffusion electrodes with tailored pore hierarchies and microstructured flow fields that maintain reaction zone homogeneity [32]. Reaction acceleration strategies must integrate atomic-scale catalyst design (such as strain-engineered active sites) with macroscopic process intensification [33]. For example, photothermal activation techniques demonstrate particular promise, enhancing charge transfer kinetics through localized plasmonic heating [34]. Computational fluid dynamics-guided reactor design, when combined with real-time electrolyte concentration modulation enables dynamic optimization of interfacial reaction environments. These advancements collectively push the boundaries of sustainable electrosynthesis, bridging the critical gap between laboratory discovery and industrial implementation. However, the true test lies in reconciling these extreme performance parameters; sustaining ultrafast electron transfer rates at industrial current densities without accelerating catalyst degradation presents a quintessential engineering paradox demanding novel materials solutions [29,35]. The industrial landscape introduces multifaceted challenges that laboratory environments rarely anticipate. Reactor design must evolve beyond single-cell optimization to embrace modular architectures enabling seamless scalability from kilowatt to megawatt capacities, all while integrating intelligent thermal management systems capable of dissipating megawatt-level heat loads with spatial variation [36]. System integration emerges as a critical hurdle, requiring sophisticated power electronics to harmonize intermittent renewable inputs with millisecond-precision control, coupled with AI-driven automation platforms that dynamically optimize process parameters across thousands of interconnected cells. Scaling effects fundamentally alter reaction dynamics—while lab-scale reactors achieve uniform mass transfer through centimeter-scale diffusion paths, industrial-scale systems battle long-distance reactant distribution networks that can depress reaction rates, necessitating revolutionary approaches to feedstock distribution and in-line product separation [8,35]. In complex electrolytic systems designed for high-value anodic product generation, the challenges of the new coupling electrocatalysis processes discussed above demand prioritized attention, such as maintaining sustained Faradaic efficiency against competing OER pathways, ensuring material compatibility under corrosive electrochemical environments, and developing energy-efficient product recovery architectures. These multifaceted requirements fundamentally redefine conventional process engineering paradigms for electrochemical systems. Ultimately, economic viability hinges on orchestrating these technical advancements into a cohesive ecosystem where high energy efficiencies coexist with competitive production costs, all while outpacing established petrochemical processes in both carbon intensity and market responsiveness—a feat requiring simultaneous innovation across materials science, process engineering, and supply chain. This multidimensional optimization defines the new frontier of industrial electrosynthesis, where success demands not only incremental improvements but also fundamental reimagining how electrochemical technologies interface with global energy and manufacturing infrastructures. In summary, the paradigm-shifting objective now crystallizes in operationalizing industrial-scale electrochemical manufacturing facilities capable of synergistically delivering three transformative outcomes: net-negative carbon footprints, enhanced grid resilience through chemical energy buffering, and cost-competitive production metrics that disrupt traditional petrochemical economics. These next-generation electrosynthesis hubs aim to align with carbon neutrality, serving as operational blueprints for circular economies where renewable electrons directly power value-added chemical synthesis while dynamically stabilizing clean energy infrastructure. While this technological frontier presents unprecedented potential, its realization demands systematic navigation through multi-scale challenges spanning fundamental science to industrial implementation. Short-term priorities should focus on AI-assisted screening and multi-scale dynamic in-situ monitoring to advance high-performance catalytic interfaces and membrane development, while simultaneously enhancing durability under high current densities to ensure economic viability. Medium-term goals include deploying smart reactors with embedded sensors and closed-loop optimization for adaptive voltage modulation based on renewable energy fluctuations, alongside AI-driven monitoring platforms. Ultimately, sustained efforts will enable the transition of laboratory innovations to fully autonomous industrial-scale systems. The path toward operationalizing these transformative concepts remains punctuated by critical knowledge gaps in reaction engineering, economic viability, and scalability constraints that must be resolved through concerted interdisciplinary efforts.
