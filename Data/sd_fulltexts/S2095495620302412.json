Graphic abstract A highly efficient bifunctional oxygen catalytic electrode is enabled via NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures on nanoarray architecture that integrates and fully manifests the ORR catalytic activity of NiO and the OER catalytic activity of NiFe2O4. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Heterostructure Nanoarray architecture Bifunctional catalysis Oxygen diffusion electrode Lithium–oxygen batteries In recent years, as one of the most promising chemical power sources for future society, lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) battery receives great attention due to its extremely high theoretical energy density of 3505 Wh kg–1 [1–4]. In practice, large polarization and consequent low energy efficiency currently still hinder the application of Li–O2 batteries, which mainly results from the sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics of oxygen diffusion electrodes in aprotic electrolytes [5]. On one hand, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aprotic electrolytes is intrinsically sluggish due to the difficult charge transfer, the low solubility of oxygen, and the blockage of mass diffusion channels by discharge product accumulation [6]. On the other hand, the high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aprotic electrolytes is also observed because of the high-energy barrier of Li2O2 reduction and the limited contact between Li2O2 and solid catalysts [7,8]. Therefore, bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrodes that can efficiently facilitate both the ORR and OER in aprotic electrolytes are highly desired to ameliorate the large polarizations of Li–O2 batteries [9]. So far great efforts have been dedicated to the research and development of bifunctional catalysts for Li–O2 batteries, however single-component catalytic materials that have intrinsic bifunctional catalytic activities are still restricted to few perovskite oxides [10,11]. Catalytically active perovskite oxides with a formula ABO3 usually have scarce rare-earth element La or alkaline-earth element Sr at the “A” sites, which will further results in the shortage of traditional perovskite catalysts [12]. In order to break through this limitation, two kinds of combinational strategies have been reported to explore more bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrodes. The first one is to prepare binary metal compounds or alloys that combine the electronic configurations and catalytic activities of two differently featured metal elements at atomic level [13,14]. For instance, PtAu alloy nanoparticles combine the ORR catalytic activity of surface Au atoms and the OER catalytic activity of surface Pt atoms to achieve the bifunctional catalytic activity [14]. The second approach to enable bifunctional activities is to fabricate nanocomposites via nanoscale assembling, which integrate the catalytic activities of two differently featured nanosized materials. In previous reports, the nanocomposites of carbon-carbon [15,16], carbon-transition metal oxide (TMO) [17–22], and TMO-TMO [23–26] were all prepared as the bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrodes. For example, RuO2/Mn2O3 tube-in-tube nanocomposite integrate the ORR catalytic activity of Mn2O3 and the OER catalytic activity of RuO2 to achieve an excellent bifunctional activity [24]. Although the above-mentioned combinational strategies for bifunctional catalysts preparation enable the reversible charge-discharge cycles of reported Li-O2 batteries, the charge and discharge polarizations of oxygen electrodes summarized in the Table S1 in Supporting Information (SI) are still high to deteriorate battery energy efficiencies. In order to further enhance the catalytic performance of oxygen electrodes, several factors including materials, composite dimensions, and electrode architectures should be reconsidered for multiple-component catalysts. Firstly, although a wide variety of carbon nanomaterials coupled with different doping provide lots of possibilities to prepare highly efficient catalysts [27–29], peroxides and superoxide radicals formed during the oxygen electrochemical reactions will react with carbon materials to degrade the oxygen electrode quickly [30,31]. Compared to the unstable nature of carbon materials and the scarcity of noble metals, the diverse transition metals provide more possibilities for oxygen electrodes to achieve desired bifunctional catalytic activities via the different combination of two TMOs. Currently, the TMO composites as bifunctional catalysts for Li–O2 batteries are limited in RuO2-MnO2 [23,24] and Co3O4-MnO2 systems [25,26]. Therefore, more possible combinations of TMOs should be extensively studied for highly efficient bifunctional catalysis. Secondly, being different with the atomic-level mix in alloys and compounds and the nanoscale assembling in nanocomposites, heterostructure might be an alternative composite dimension to integrate the distinct features of each component. For instance, NiCo2S4-NiO core-shell heterostructure integrates the different LiO2-affinity characteristics of each component to promote the formation of large peasecod like Li2O2 and then enhance the electrode capacity [32]. In NiO-NiCo2O4 heterostructure microsphere, NiCo2O4 is helpful for boosting reactions on oxygen electrodes for Li–O2 batteries and NiO is likely to promote the decomposition of certain by-products [33]. Therefore, heterostructure is a promising architecture to integrate different functionalities of each component. Highly efficient ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic electrodes for Li-O2 batteries could be achieved via heterostructures that integrate the ORR catalytic activity of one component with the OER catalytic activity of another component. Thirdly, bifunctional active sites in porous composite electrodes are usually blocked by binders and other additives. Therefore, novel electrode architectures such as nanoarrys are also highly desired to manifest the catalyst activity in oxygen electrodes [34–36]. With these concerns, herein, we prepare a nanowire array (NA) electrode on carbon cloth (CC) by the self-scaffolding of NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures through a facile hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination in air (see the SI for experimental details). This simple synthesis route simultaneously integrates two resource-abundant TMOs on one electrode only by the control of raw material ratio instead of the redundant steps assembling multiple components one by one. Although NiO‐NiFe2O4 composite was demonstrated to be a very promising catalyst for only the OER in aqueous solution [37], its catalytic activity in aprotic electrolyte is not revealed yet. In the NiO‐NiFe2O4 heterostructures, dissimilar crystalized grains grow one on another to form nanowires with lots of heterojunctions. When used as a novel architecture for oxygen electrodes of Li-O2 batteries, the NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures in NA electrode integrate the ORR catalytic active sites of NiO and the OER catalytic active sites of NiFe2O4 within several nanometers to achieve intensive bifunctional activity. In addition, the bifunctional catalytic activity is fully manifested via the openly accessible nanoarray architecture without binder blockage and the ultimate contact between discharge products and heterostructures. Thus, NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures on NA scaffold (NiO-NiFe2O4@CC) achieve a high capacity of 3.35 mA h cm–2 and an extremely low overall overpotential of 1.17 V (the sum of cathodic and anodic overpotentials). The morphologies of prepared NA electrodes were firstly investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1 (a and b) shows that NiO-NiFe2O4@CC has a sea urchin-like morphology composed of nanowires uniformly grown on the fibers of CC. This urchin-like NAs on CC form a porous architecture that exposes almost all catalytic active sites, facilitates mass diffusion, accommodates discharge product, and thus functions as an efficient gas diffusion electrode. The chemical components and crystal phases of prepared NA electrodes were then studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The HRTEM image in Fig. 1(c) shows a morphology of crystal grain packing. In detail, the well-resolved lattice fringes with the d-spacings of 0.210 and 0.244 nm can be assigned to the (111) plane of cubic NiO and the (311) plane of spinel NiFe2O4, respectively. Therefore, the nanowires in NiO-NiFe2O4@CC are not single phases but heterostructures composed of NiO and NiFe2O4. Consequently, the self-scaffolding of NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures on interweaved nanowires form a nanoarray architecture, enabling NiO-NiFe2O4@CC functions as a porous oxygen catalytic electrode. In order to comparatively study the catalytic activities of NiO and NiFe2O4 single components, NiO and NiFe2O4 NAs on CC (NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC) were also prepared by the similar hydrothermal route (see SI for details) as reference electrodes. As investigated in Figs. S1 and S2 by SEM and XRD, both NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC have the morphologies of interconnected nanosheets, except that NiO nanosheets are much bigger than NiFe2O4 nanosheets. These interconnected nanosheets also form a porous architecture that can function as gas diffusion electrode. Both XRD and XPS studies further confirm the chemical composition of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC. In the XRD pattern of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC in Fig. 1(d), besides the diffraction peak at around 25 degrees (marked with #) of carbon fiber in CC, diffraction peaks indexed to the (220), (311), and (440) lattices of spinel NiFe2O4 phase (JCPDS 86-2267) [37] and diffraction peaks indexed to the (111), (200) lattices of cubic NiO phase (JCPDS 78-429) [38] are clearly observed without any other purity. The XPS survey spectrum of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC (Fig. S3 in SI) supports the presence of C, O, Ni, and Fe elements without other purities. The EDS mappings of a single fiber in NiO-NiFe2O4@CC (Fig. S4 in SI) confirm the uniform distribution of Ni and Fe element. The intensities in mapping indicate that the Ni/Fe atomic ratio is 2/1, which is consistent with the ratio of 2.1:1.0 determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and the raw materials ratio. The molar ratio of NiO/NiFe2O4 in the heterostructures is approximately 3:1. The high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p in Fig. 1(e) can be fitted as the Ni2+ peaks at 854.1 and 871.6 eV and the Ni3+ peaks at 856.1 and 873.6 eV with satellite peaks [33]. The binding energies of surface Ni in NiO-NiFe2O4 is very close to that in single NiO phase because molar amount of NiO is three times than NiFe2O4 in the heterostructures [39]. The Fe 2p spectrum in Fig. 1(f) clearly shows the Fe2+ peaks at 710.5 and 722.4 eV and Fe3+ peaks 712.8 and 725.0 eV [40], indicating a mixed valence spinel composition. The binding energies of Fe in NiO-NiFe2O4 is consistent with that in single NiFe2O4 phase [41]. All these characterizations confirm that the NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures are successfully prepared on nanowire arrays. The electrochemical performances of Li−O2 batteries using heterostructured NiO-NiFe2O4@CC as the cathodes are studied comparing to those with NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC cathodes. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), NiO-NiFe2O4@CC shows the highest specific capacity of 3.35 mA cm–2 at the current density of 0.1 mA cm–2 from 2.0 V to 4.3 V, while NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC only give 2.25 and 2.75 mA cm–2, respectively. Not only so, NiO-NiFe2O4@CC also shows the lowest overall overpotential of 1.17 V (the sum of cathodic and anodic overpotentials at 50% capacities) among the studied NA electrodes. The voltage profiles comparison of NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC in Fig. 2(a) shows that NiO@CC has much higher discharge voltage plateau (2.80 V) than that of NiFe2O4@CC (2.55 V). This result suggests that NiO@CC has higher ORR catalytic activity than NiFe2O4@CC. By contrast, NiFe2O4@CC has lower charge voltage plateau (3.95 V) than that of NiO@CC (4.08 V), indicating the higher OER catalytic activity of NiFe2O4@CC than NiO@CC. Interestingly, NiO-NiFe2O4@CC shows a high discharge plateau at 2.83 V that is very close to the discharge plateau of NiO@CC at 2.80 V and a low charge plateau at 4.0 V that is very close to the charge plateau of NiFe2O4@CC at 3.95 V. This means that heterostructured NiO-NiFe2O4@CC integrates the high ORR catalytic activity of NiO and the high OER catalytic activity of NiFe2O4 to function as a bifunctional catalyst for oxygen electrode. Compared with the reported bifunctional catalysts based on noble metal free materials in literatures (Table S1 in the SI), NiO-NiFe2O4@CC shows the lowest overall overpotential when the current densities are higher than 0.1 mA cm–2. The superior activity of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC could also be attributed to its highest electrochemical surface area (ECSA) with the highest amount of active sites. Cyclic voltammetry tests in Fig. S5(a-c) were carried out in the double-layer region to determine the capacitances. The double-layer capacitances (C dl) of NiO@CC, NiFe2O4@CC and NiO–NiFe2O4@CC determined by the plot of currents versus the scan rates in Fig. S5(d) are 11.37, 6.76 and 31 mF cm–2, respectively. These results indicate that NiO-NiFe2O4@CC has the highest amount of catalytic active sites. Due to the integrated bifunctional catalytic activities on nanoarray architecture, heterostructured NiO-NiFe2O4@CC demonstrates excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling life than each single components. At the high current densities of 0.2 and 0.3 mA cm–2, NiO-NiFe2O4@CC hybrid NAs still deliver high areal capacities of 2.25 and 1.1 mAh cm–2 (Fig. 2b). NiO is reported as a N-type semiconductor with a band gap of 3.5 eV [32], and as-prepared NiFe2O4 is p-type with band gap of 1.6 eV [42] because of the presence of Ni3+ and hole-hopping from Ni3+ to Ni2+ [43,44]. The p-n junction of NiO–NiFe2O4 heterostructre can induce a built-in electric field on the heterointerface to boost internal charge transfer and accelerate reaction kinetics during repeated cell operations [32]. The narrower band gap of NiO than NiFe2O4 also enables the facile charge transfer of NiO–NiFe2O4 heterostructure. Therefore, the distinct electronic structure of NiO–NiFe2O4 heterostructure enables more activities to exhibit faster reaction kinetics than each single component. The cycling performance of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC were studied with a current density of 0.05 mA cm–2 and a curtailed capacity of 0.25 mA h cm–2 comparing to NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC. As shown in Fig. 2(c), at the capacity of 0.1 mA h cm–2, the overall overpotenitals of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC, NiO@CC, and NiFe2O4@CC are 0.52, 1.18, and 1.23 V, respectively. At the capacity of 0.2 mA h cm–2, NiO-NiFe2O4@CC shows the second charge plateau resulting in an overall overpotenial of 0.99 V, which is still lower than those of NiO@CC and NiFe2O4@CC. The excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC results in 46 cycles (Fig. S6 in SI), which is much higher than the 20 cycles of NiFe2O4@CC and 4 cycles of NiO@CC. In order to further illustrate the bifunctional performance, both ORR and OER catalytic activities of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC were investigated in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 2(d) shows linear scanning voltammograms (LSV) of prepared NA electrodes in the OER voltage range at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s–1 (see SI for the experiment details). The OER overpotentials (η) of NiO@CC, NiFe2O4@CC and NiO-NiFe2O4@CC are 470, 390 and 340 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2, respectively. As shown in Fig. S7(a) in SI, Tafel slopes are 196, 124, and 102 mV dec–1 for NiO@CC, NiFe2O4@CC and NiO-NiFe2O4@CC, respectively. The overpotentials and Tafel slopes clearly indicate that NiFe2O4@CC has higher OER catalytic activity than NiO@CC, and NiO-NiFe2O4@CC integrates the distinct nature of NiFe2O4 to present excellent OER catalytic activity. The LSV curves in ORR range were determined at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s–1 via rotating disk electrodes (RDE) loaded with active materials scratched from NA electrodes (see SI for experiment details). Fig. S7(b-d) shows the LSV curves of NiO-NiFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and NiO with different rotating speeds, respectively. Fig. 2(d) compares the LSV curves of NiO, NiFe2O4 and NiO-NiFe2O4 at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. NiO shows more positive onset potential and higher diffusion-limiting current density than NiFe2O4, indicating that NiO@CC has higher ORR catalytic activity than NiFe2O4@CC. Interestingly, NiO-NiFe2O4@CC integrates the ORR catalytic activity of NiO to present the highest diffusion-limiting current density, namely the highest ORR catalytic activity among the prepared three NA electrodes. The schematic diagram in Fig. 2(f) illustrates the bifunctional catalysis mechanism of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC enabled by the NA architecture formed by the self-scaffolding of heterostructures. Firstly, the textural porous architectures of NA electrodes provide the efficient diffusion paths for oxygen and lithium ions, and the sufficient inner space for the accommodation of discharge product. Secondly, almost all the ORR and OER active sites are accessible to reaction reactive materials. In detail, oxygen and lithium ion efficiently diffuse to ORR active sites and facilely react to product Li2O2. As shown in Fig. 2(f), due to the uniformly distributed heterostructures in the NA electrode that integrate ORR and OER catalytic activities in nanoscales, Li2O2 not only forms on ORR active sites but also ultimately contact with the exposed OER active sites. Thus, in the charge process, Li2O2 can be easily oxidation to release oxygen and lithium ions. Therefore, heterostructured NiO-NiFe2O4@CC achieves a highly efficient bifunctional catalytic performance. The structural advantages and bifunctional activities of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC were also investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of discharged and charged NA electrodes. SEM images of discharged and charged NA electrodes at low magnification were shown in Fig. S8 in SI. At high magnification, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the thick cover layer of discharge product is seen on the NiO-NiFe2O4@CC and the nanowire arrays cannot be observed. After the discharge, the nanowire arrays morphology reappears in Fig. 3(b). In order to analysis the chemical component of discharge product, the XPS spectra of discharged and charged NA electrodes were collected in Fig. 4 . After discharge, Li 1s peak at 54.6 eV (Fig. 4a) and O 1s peak at 531.0 eV (Fig. 4b) of Li2O2 are clearly seen [35,45]. While, the small Li 1s peak at 55.5 eV and O 1s peak at 532.1 eV indicate the formation of Li2CO3 side product [35,45]. Therefore, the discharge product of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC are Li2O2 with small amount of Li2CO3. After the following charge, all the Li 1s peak at 54.6 eV (Fig. 4a) and O 1s peak at 531.0 eV (Fig. 4b) of Li2O2 are completely disappeared, indicating the reversible decomposition of main discharge product. Although there is still residual Li 1s peak at 55.5 eV of Li2CO3 on charged NiO-NiFe2O4@CC, O 1s peak at 529.7 eV for Metal-O is clearly seen after the elimination of Li2O2 [40]. All the SEM and XPS investigations further demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic activities of NiO-NiFe2O4@CC, which enables the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2. In contrast, the aggregation of discharge product can be found on both discharged NiFe2O4@CC (Fig. 3c) and discharged NiO@CC (Fig. 3e) along the nanosheets in the NAs. However, after the charge process, the discharge product on both charged NiFe2O4@CC (Fig. 3d) and charged NiO@CC (Fig. 3f) cannot be completely eliminated. This is because that both NiFe2O4@CC and NiO@CC are not bifunctional catalytic electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4(c and d), the XPS peaks of Li2O2 on discharged NiFe2O4@CC are almost eliminated by the charge process, and only small amount of Li2CO3 remains. The excellent OER catalytic activity of NiFe2O4 is clearly demonstrated. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4(e and f), no Li2CO3 is formed on the discharge NiO@CC, which might be ascribed to its excellent ORR catalytic activity. However, after the charge process, large amount of Li2O2 still remain on NiO@CC electrode, suggesting a poor OER catalytic activity. That is why NiO@CC shows a very short cycling life in Fig. S6. All these SEM and XPS investigations indicate the poor reversibility of NiFe2O4@CC and NiO@CC, and NiO-NiFe2O4@CC integrate the advantages of each component to achieve a comprehensive bifunctional performance. In summary, we have developed a bifunctional oxygen electrode for lithium–oxygen batteries via fabricating NiO-NiFe2O4 heterostructures on nanowire arrays architecture, i.e. NiO-NiFe2O4@CC, through a facile hydrothermal route followed by calcination in air. NiO-NiFe2O4@CC integrates and fully manifests the ORR catalytic activity of NiO and OER catalytic activity of NiFe2O4 to enable a highly efficient bifunctional activity. NiO-NiFe2O4@CC achieves an extremely low overall overpotential of 1.17 V at the current density of 0.1 mA cm–2, which is the lowest one among the reported noble metal free bifunctional oxygen electrodes so far. This work presents an effective strategy to develop highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrodes for aprotic Li−O2 batteries via preparing heterostructures on nanoarrays that integrates the ORR and OER catalytic activities of each component.
