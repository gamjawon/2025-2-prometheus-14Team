Fung* Exxon Research and Engineering Company, Route 22 East, Annandale, N! 08801, USA Received 24 January 1994; revised 19 May 1994; accepted 19 May 1994 Abstract Coke oxidation rates on supported metal catalysts were studied by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The TPO data were successfully modeled with a linear combination of power-law kinetic expressions. The validity and limitations of the model, for carbon oxidation on metal containing catalysts, were analyzed in detail. The influence of heating rate, coke concentration, coke particle size and number, catalyst mass and oxygen concentration on TPO spectra predicted by the model agreed well with experimental results. Coke particle size and morphology have a great influence on a WO spectrum. Even though this simplified form of kinetic expression does not explicitly account for all the physical phenomena in a coke-burn process, it considers some of the most important factors: the effect of carbon surface area and the promotional effect of supported metals on coke-burn kinetics. Deconvolution of a complex TPO spectrum by the above model provides kinetic parameters which can be used to predict TPO spectra of partial-coke-burn experiments. Difficulties in the predictive capability of this model arrive if other factors such as large variations in coke morphology and coke particle size exist and there is no information relating them to a particular feature in the TPO spectrum. However, the model can adequately account for these variations, if their characteristics and extent are known, e.g., they may be determined by electron microscopy.

Querini,S.CFunglAppliedCatalysisA:General117(19w)53-74 disposal of used catalysts and catalyst recovery has stimulated research efforts to extend the life of a catalyst as has been shown by the appearance of several review articles on catalyst deactivation in the same issue of `Catalysis, Vol. 9' [ 1-3] . Catalyst regeneration is also extensively covered in recent papers [ 4-7 ] and reviews [ 1,8,9] . Most of the literature in the regeneration field deals with mathematical models for the estimation of the maximum temperature increase during regeneration. Excessive temperature rise can lead to irreversible damage to a catalyst [ 10-13 ] . Models developed so far, are related to monofunctional acid catalysts. The intrinsic kinetics of coke combustion has been assumed to be first order with respect to coke and oxygen. These models are based on one type of coke and assume catalysts are free of metal [ 14-22 ] . Even in catalysts such as Cr203/A1203 where Cr203 catalyzes coke oxidation [ 21,23 ] , a single type of coke has been assumed when writing the kinetic expression [4,12] . There is no account for coke deposited far away from the Cr203- In a few cases, different intrinsic kinetic expressions have been compared. Hughes and Shettigar [ 24 ] used a power-law kinetic in the testing of their data where first and 2/3 order were assumed for coke. Both models gave similar quality in their fitting of the experimental data. But the 2/3 order showed statistical parameters slightly better than the first order. When coke has a three dimensional structure, the oxidation reaction occurs on the surface of the coke particles, and the order with respect to coke results in less than first order [ 24] . Coke on supported metal catalysts, such as Pt/A1203, has been shown to consist of more than one type [ 25 ] . In some cases two well defined temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) peaks have been obtained [ 25 ] . In other cases, up to five different peaks are used to fit a TPO spectrum of a coked bimetallic Pt-Re/ A1203-Cl catalyst [ 26 ] . In the latter study, the curve fitting was done using Gaussian curves, from which activation energies were calculated. With this procedure, it was not possible to analyze the influence of oxygen partial pressure, coke reaction order, coke concentration, or sample size on the TO spectrum. Meaningful comparison of literature TPO data, on coked catalysts obtained at a wide range of experimental conditions, can be realized only if these effects on a TPO spectrum are understood. Though some of these kinds of effects have been studied in detail in temperature-programmed reduction, TPR, [ 27 ] there is little discussion on TPO of coked catalysts. During coke burning, several phenomena are taking place. At lower temperature, Pt and the other metals are oxidized, perhaps before and as the coke starts burning [ 28 ] . The original metal and its oxide have different catalyzing effects on the reaction between coke and oxygen. A t higher temperature, the mobility of MO,, species increases and could promote the burning of coke on the support. At high enough temperatures, sintering occurs, and lower activity could be observed. Additionally, there may be a change in the reaction order of the different types of carbon due to change in the concentration of coke during the TPO process, as will be CA. Querini, S. C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 55 discussed in following sections. Hydrogen in coke oxidizes at higher rate than carbon. This might affect heat balance during coke removal from pellets [ 16] . At low temperatures there is an initial adsorption of oxygen to form partially oxidized species [ 16,29 ] . Due to the complexity of all such phenomena, and the lack of a detailed knowledge of the individual kinetics for some of them, it is not possible to develop an all encompassing kinetic model in TPO experiments. The objective of this study is to determine the validity of the often used linear combination of power law kinetic expressions [28,30,31] for coke oxidation on supported metal catalysts. Though the model does not directly account for all the above phenomena, it implicitly considers the catalyzing effect of metals and metal oxides by providing a type of coke burned at a lower temperature. Additionally coke-buns kinetics is expressed in term of surface carbon atom concentration instead of total carbon concentration. Model predictions are tested against experimental results on the effects of heating rate, oxygen concentration, coke concentration, coke particle size and number, reaction order of coke, and sample size on TPO spectra. Deconvolution of a complex TPO spectrum by the above model provides kinetic parameters which can be used to predict TPO spectra of partial-coke-burn experiments even though this simplified form of kinetic expression does not explicitly account for all the physical phenomena in the coke-burn process. 2. Experimental TPO was used to obtain data for the reaction between coke and oxygen. Experiments using various heating rates, oxygen concentrations, final temperatures, and coke concentration were carried out. In a typical TPO experiment, a dilute oxygen stream (in helium) at constant flow-rate of 60 cm3/min is fed into the sample cell under ambient conditions. The sample temperature is increased linearly at the desired heating rate from room temperature to a high enough final temperature at which complete oxidation of all the carbon deposits occurs. The exit gas containing a mixture of C02, Oz, H20, and He is fed into a methanator. The methanator is supplied with a pure hydrogen stream at 22 cm3/min. A supported Ru catalyst in the methanator quantitatively transforms C02 into CH4 which is continuously monitored by a flame ionization detector (O). This new detection method greatly improves the sensitivity, the stability of the baseline, and the resolution of the conventional TPO technique, making it specially suitable to obtain kinetic data. Additional details of this procedure can be found elsewhere [ 32 ] . To avoid diffusion effects, all experiments were carried out under kinetic regime using 60-80 mesh particles. This was verified by running TPO using the same coked sample at various particles sizes. When the sample particles were in the range of 0.250-0.177 mm (60-80 mesh particles) or smaller, the same TPO spectra were obtained. However, bigger particles within the range of 0.420-0.250 mm (40- 56 CA. Querini, S. C.

This agrees with calculation reported in [ 10]. 3. Model formulation Fig. IA shows a typical TPO spectrum of a Pt/A1203-C1 reforming catalyst containing 1.26% C, at three heating rates. The catalyst was coked using n-heptane as feed, at a H2/n-C7 ratio of 3, 175 psig and 482 for 290 hours. It can be seen that there are several peaks that form the whole envelope. Let q be the number of peaks. Each of them corresponds to a certain type of coke. Assuming that for each peak there is a reaction of the type: CH,,+(1+h/4)02-3'COZ+h/2H20 and each of them follows a power law kinetic of the form: r;=A;~exp-Ei/RT~S;~Poz (A) where ri is the production rate of CO2, in mole s-' g-' catalyst, from the ith coke type and S; is the exposed surface area of a particular type of carbon in square centimeters per 100 g of catalyst, Po, is the partial pressure of oxygen and m is the oxygen reaction order. Coke exposed area Sl is related to the initial area S;o based on its conversion level X;. It can be shown that a general relationship can be written as: CA. Querini, S.C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 57 Si Sio' (1 Xi)n (2) where n is coke reaction order, and depends upon the geometry and how coke is consumed during the oxidation process. For spherical particles n=2/3. If coke particles are such that all carbon atoms are exposed, then, n =1. Since the surface to volume ratio of a sphere is equal to 3 /R, Sio is related to the initial concentration of the ith coke type, C,n in gram of coke per 100 g of catalyst, by: Sio=3' Ciol(Rio'dc,) (3) R,ro is the initial radius of the ith coke particle and d. is coke density (g/cm3).

For a dilute oxygen stream and a small amount of carbon in the analysis, the outlet gas flow-rate is essentially equal to the inlet flow-rate because the increase in the number of moles in the gas phase according to Reaction (A) is insignificant. It has been generally accepted that pseudo-steady state for the gas phase can be assumed for these systems [ 11,13,33,34] . This implies that dYco/dt is considered to be much smaller than Fo - dYcO2/dw. At any instant during the reaction, the concentration in weight fraction, of each type of carbon, is: Ci=Ci0' ( 1 -Xi) (7) There are 3 parameters associated with each peak: Ei, Ai, and Cio; plus the carbon reaction order, n. The reaction order could be the same or different for all the peaks. Oxygen reaction order m will be taken as 1 throughout this study [ 14-20] . The experimental information obtained from the TO experiment is the total production rate of C02 (sum of C02 produced from each individual type of coke) as a function of temperature. The temperature of the sample is increased at a constant rate. The C02 production rate from the ith coke type is given by: Wildt= =Aig - exp(-EilRT) - CIO (1-Xi)n -Po2 * 12 - 100 (8) also: 58 CA. Querini, S.C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 9 E Ci0 - C ( i where C% is the total amount of coke, in wt.-%, initially on the catalyst. This can be determined from the TPO spectrum with a calibration by a known standard as described in [ 32 ] . The 02 partial pressure is calculated with a mass balance, since it is related to the C02 produced, according to the stoichiometry of Reaction (A). The estimation of the parameters involved in the model is done by minimization of the objective function: G= ~ [ (Ycoz)eXP- (Yco2)cay (10) NP is the number of points obtained in the TPO spectrum, ( YC02) eXP is the C02 concentration that has been experimentally obtained and (Yc02) ce, is the amount of C02 calculated from solving Eqs. (8) and (6) for a given set of parameters. The differential equations are solved using an implicit method of Moulton-Bashforth, and the minimization is done with the Levemberg-Marquardt algorithm. In some studies, coke concentration has been used instead of the amount of exposed coke [ 30] . In such cases, reaction rate for each type of coke is given by: r;=Ai-exp(-E;lRT) -C`-Po2 (11) Even though the use of total coke concentration is not properly related to the reaction mechanism, it can be used as an empirical equation to represent the behavior of the coke-02 reaction in supported metal catalysts. Eqs. (4) and (11) are identical for coke reaction order 1. It will be discussed in a later section that there are advantages in using Eq. (4) or Eq. (8) over Eq. (11) in cases where the carbon reaction order differs from one. The consideration of carbon surface area, Eqs. (4) and (8) , in the kinetic model gives a much better description of the coke-burn process than just relying on carbon concentration, Eq. (11). In general, the H/C ratio (h) was taken as 0.5, because this is the average value reported in the literature for these catalysts [ 29,35 ] . Parameters estimation was done by regression of a single set of data, and by regression of 2 independent sets of data simultaneously, obtained at two different heating rates: 7 and 13/min. Both Eqs. (4) and (11) will be tested in these regressions. First the model will be used to analyze the influence of experimental variables in the TPO spectrum for a single type of coke in order to gain some understanding of the technique. Results from these calculations are checked with experimental data. CA. Querini, S. C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 59 4. TPO Strum analyses 4.1. Influence of heating rate The sensitivities of the TPO and TPR techniques, to heating rate, are similar. However, the present TPO technique has a major advantage over TPR because the FID in a TPO experiment directly measures the absolute quantity of COZ produced (as CH4). The highly sensitive FID detector can detect less than 10-9 g of hydrocarbons. In contrast, in a TPR experiment, the signal observed is due to the difference in the hydrogen concentration of the inlet and outlet streams passing through the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A substantial consumption of hydrogen by the sample is required to give reasonable precision of the measurement, because of the low sensitivity of TCD in comparison with FID. This requires a minimum of 10% hydrogen conversion at the peak maximum [ 36 ] . For a fixed amount of catalyst, hydrogen concentration, and flow-rate, there is a minimum heating rate below which insufficient hydrogen conversion occurs and a meaningful signal cannot be obtained. The maximum heating rate in a TPR experiment is determined by the amount of hydrogen consumed at the peak maximum not to exceed 2/3 of the hydrogen fed to the sample cell in order to avoid severe mass transport limitations [ 36 ] . Therefore, a relative small range of heating rate, a variation within a factor of 2, should be used for a fixed amount of catalyst and hydrogen input. In the present TPO experiments, a wider range of heating rate, within a factor of 4, can be chosen since there is enough sensitivity of the FID to accommodate low heating rate. High heating rate used in a TPO experiment shortens the time needed to complete an analysis and greatly increases the sensitivity of the technique. At too high a heating rate, problems associated with both mass and heat transfer encountered in TPR also occur in TPO. Fig. lA shows three TPO spectra, obtained under the same experimental conditions varying only their heating rates: 25, 13 and 7/min, of a coked catalyst. Temperatures at peak maximum, TM, differ by 37 for the spectra obtained at 7/min and at 25/min, and their maximum peak heights differ by a factor of 3. Lower sensitivity is obtained with the low heating rate. However, the areas of the three spectra are the same, when calculated as total amount of COZ VStime. Moreover, it can be seen that the temperature at which signal starts increasing is the same for all three heating rates. The temperature at which the signal goes back to zero decreases as the heating rate decreases. However, this compression of the spectrum does not lead to a reduction in the resolution at lower heating rate. It can be seen in Fig. lA that there is no difference in the resolution (separation) of these peaks when changing the heating rate from 25 to TV /min. This inconsistency is resolved later when we show the effect of heating rate on the simulated TPO spectrum of a single type of carbon using the model. The reason that lower heating rate finishes coke oxidation at a lower temperature can be visualized better when the data in Fig. 1 A are plotted as a percentage of the coke remaining on the catalyst 60 CA.

Lowering the heating rate results in lengthening the time for the catalyst remaining at a particular temperature and, therefore, provides more coke removal. Fig. 1 B shows the simulated TPO spectra calculated from the model ( Eqs. ( 8 ) and ( 6 ) ) , for a single peak at the three heating rates. The pre-exponential factor, A;,,, is 20, the activation energy is 40 kcal/mol, coke content is 3 wt.-%, and catalyst mass is 20 mg. Oxygen and carbon reaction orders were taken as 1. The same qualitative results as those observed experimentally in Fig. 1 A are obtained. The TO spectra obtained at the three heating rates show that their signals start to increase at the same temperature, but the completion of carbon oxidation ends at different final temperatures. The lower heating rate produces the lower final temperature. There is a 40 downward shift in TM when the heating rate is lowered from 25 to 7/min. This is in good agreement with experimental data. The magnitude of the downward shift in the temperature of peak maximum depends on the activation energy. Additionally, Fig. 1B shows that the peak width at half height decreases when the heating rate is reduced. This explains why the resolution of the multi-peak structure in Fig. lA does not diminish when the heating rate is lowered. The expected loss in the resolution of the spectrum due to compression, is compensated by the narrowing of the line width of the individual peaks. 4.2. Coke reaction order Fig. 3 shows the effect of reaction order of carbon on the simulated TPO spectra of a single carbon peak. Spectra are obtained using Eqs. ( 8 ) and ( 6) with the same activation energy, preexponential factor, coke concentration and catalyst mass as CA. Querini, S. C.

Decreasing the order below 1 accentuates the asymmetric character of the peak, i.e., a fast decrease in the reaction rate on the high temperature side of the peak. The change in coke reaction order during TPO, from zero to 1, and its physical significance will be discussed in a later section. A change in the heating rate has little effect on the symmetry of the peak (see Fig. 1 B) but has a profound influence on the temperature at peak maximum, TM, for any reaction order. 4.3. Infuence of coke content Fig. 4A shows the experimental TPO spectrum of a coked catalyst with 7.33 C%. This TPO spectrum was obtained under the standard TPO condition heating up to a final temperature of 770 (solid line). Another TPO spectrum (dash line) of this catalyst was obtained by performing a second TPO after the coke has been partially burned off in a TPO experiment with a final temperature of 500, holding this temperature for 30 min. The second TPO shows that only a small amount of coke was left. There are several distinct differences between these two TPO spectra. The peak position of the preburned catalyst shifts towards a lower temperature, the analysis is completed at a lower temperature, and the shape of the peak becomes more symmetric. This indicates coke concentration and quantity (coke concentration times sample weight) have a profound effect on the TPO spectrum. The origin of this effect is examined in the following section based on the relationship of coke content with the number of coke particles and their size. The increase in carbon concentration in a coked catalyst generally leads to an increase in the coke particle size and the formation of more coke particles. We will look into the independent effects of these two factors on the TPO spectrum when 62 CA. Querini, S.

Coke particle size remains unchanged at increasing coke concentration In the simulations that follows, constant initial coke particle size is assumed. This means that increasing coke concentration creates more coke particles per unit weight of catalyst, but A;, in Eq. ( 5 ) does not change, i.e., Rio is kept constant. It is obvious from Eq. ( 8 ) that increasing Coo to 2 X C;o raises the rate of coke oxidation by a factor of 2 if there is little change in oxygen concentration (when oxygen partial pressure is high and small amount of coke is in the sample cell). The difference in the total quantity of coke being removed from the two catalysts with initial coke concentration of C;o and 2 X C;o is also a factor of 2. Therefore, the coke conversion, Xj, is the same at any instant for the two cases. Their TO spectra should have the same shape and TM when both have the same coke reaction order. The only difference between these two spectra should be in their peak height when the same quantity of the coked catalysts is in the sample cell. The above statement is correct for any value of n. However, Fig. 4B, which is obtained from Eqs. (8) and (6), shows that for carbon reaction orders of 0.5 and 1, TM shifts to a higher temperature and the TPO spectrum finishes at a higher temperature when the concentration of coke is increased. The behavior observed in Fig. 4B, in contradiction of our prediction for CA. Querini, S. C.

(B) Experimental TPO spectrum of carbon physically mixed with alumina: (1) 5 wt.-% C/A1203 (2) 0.1 wt.-% C/A1203. TM remaining constant, is solely due to a significant change in oxygen partial pressure because of increasing coke concentration. It should be emphasized that there is no direct impact of coke concentration, C;o, or conversion, Xin Eq. (8) on the TM of the TPO spectrum. The catalyst mass w used in the simulation was 0.020 g, the inlet oxygen partial pressure was 0.01 atm and the gas flow-rate was 60 cm3/min. The low oxygen concentration and flow-rate resulted in a significant change in the oxygen partial pressure as coke concentration increased. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the TPO spectrum will be discussed later. The indirect carbon concentration effect (due to change in oxygen concentration) on the TM of the TPO spectra with different reaction orders is shown in Fig. 5A. Although carbon reaction orders greater than I have not been reported in the literature, they are included for comparison. Increasing the concentration of carbon shifts the TM to higher temperatures for all the reaction orders of carbon, including order of 1. The shift in TM is about 12 for all reaction orders when the coke concentration is increased from 0.5 to 5 wt.-%. Fig. 5B shows the TPO spectrum of a high surface area carbon (560 m2/g, Monarch 1400 from Cabot Corp.) physically mixed with A1203 at two different levels: 0.1 and 5 wt.-%. Fine powders of carbon and A1203 were well mixed together and then the mixtures were formed into disks under pressure. The disks were broken into 60/80 mesh particles which were used in the TPO experiments. Since the same carbon was used in both cases, it is reasonably to assume that carbon particle size was the same in both samples. Therefore, the greater amount of carbon in the higher carbon sample is solely accounted for by the increase in the number of carbon particles. There are 5 difference in TM between these two spectra. This is in good O CA. Querini. S. C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 agreement with the simulated results. Therefore, the use of carbon surface area in the kinetic model, Eq. (8) , is far superior to just considering carbon concentration in Eq. (11) as has been mentioned earlier. 4.3.2. Number of coke particles remains unchanged at increasing coke concentration An increase in the catalyst coke concentration is now assumed to be reflected solely as an increase in the size of coke particles. Assuming particles are spherical, the radius increases 1.26 times when coke concentration is doubled. Eq. (5) shows that A;,, depends inversely on initial coke particle size. Therefore, a doubling of coke concentration in Eq. (8) leads to an increase of coke oxidation rate by a factor of 2 X (1 / 1.26) =1.59 when the same amount of catalyst is used. Therefore, the conversion level, Xat any instant for the high coke level sample is lower than that of the low coke level sample. This results in shifting the TM to a higher temperature as the coke concentration is increased. Fig. 6A shows TPO spectra of a set of simulations using spherical coke particles at different coke levels. Coke reaction order of 2/3 is used in these simulations (see Eq. (2) ). It can be seen that there is a significant shift in the peak position to higher temperature and coke oxidation completes at higher temperature as carbon concentration increases. Fig. 6B, curve 1, shows TM as a function of wt.-% C for the spectra presented in Fig. 6A. Changes in TM are significantly greater than those found assuming constant coke particle size. The above section demonstrates that different dependence of TM on number of carbon particles and carbon particle size can be obtained with Eq. (8) but not with Eq. (11) , because the latter does not consider the relationship between carbon concentration and carbon surface area. As time on oil increases, coke particle size increases. TPO spectra of Pt/A1203 catalysts coked at different times on oil, were reported in [ 37 ] . When comparing samples with a coke content of 2.11 wt.-% and 6.7 wt.-%, a difference of approximately 35 was found, which indicates that coke particle size has a large influence on TM. The observed changes of the preburn sample shown in Fig. 4A, especially the change in peak shape, can be explained assuming that there is a change in the reaction order for coke. The increase in the observed reaction order as coke content decreases is the result of a decrease in coke particle size in the preburned sample because its coke level has been greatly reduced. This can be interpreted following the reasoning of Butt and Petersen [ 8 ] . Initially, when the catalyst is highly coked, forming large coke particles, the amount of carbon exposed undergoes insignificant changes when burning a small portion of it, because about the same number of new carbon atoms are exposed. The carbon oxidation rate appears to be independent of carbon concentration, i.e., an order of zero may be expected in this limiting situation. With time as the coke particles become smaller, the decrease in the carbon surface area is progressively larger for the same amount of carbon oxidized and thus the CA. Querini, S. C.

Finally when there is only a small amount of carbon left as a monolayer or as particles with diameter less than 20 A, the exposed carbon atoms are directly related to the amount of carbon, and therefore order 1 is obtained. In a practical situation, an increase in the carbon reaction order can be expected during the coke burning process if the sample contains large coke particles. The shift to a lower temperature in TM in the preburned sample's TPO spectrum is due to a large decrease in its initial coke particle size in the preburn step. The reduction in coke particle size also leads to an increase in the carbon reaction order and, therefore, a change in the shape of the TO spectrum, from asymmetric (the as received sample) to more symmetric (the preburn sample) is observed. 4.4. Influence of sample mass Catalyst mass affects TM even for a carbon reaction order of 1 due to a change in the OZ concentration during reaction. The greater the sample mass at a fixed 66 CA.

Influence of catalyst mass on TM at constant coke particle size. E=40; Ais=20, n=1. initial carbon concentration, the more the oxygen concentration decreases along the bed. Therefore, the reaction rate decreases when increasing the mass of the sample, resulting in a shift of TM toward higher temperature. This explains the results obtained by Pieck et al. [ 7 ] . They reported peak maximum temperature shifted to higher temperatures with increasing amount of coked catalyst in a sample cell. Fig. 7 shows that for an the initial carbon concentration in a catalyst of 0.5 wt.-%, TM increases by about 12 when the catalyst mass is increased from 0.0002 g to 0.2 g. When the initial carbon concentration in the catalyst is increased to 3%, changes in TM are very noticeable. In practice, one should not use high carbon content in the sample cell with low inlet oxygen concentration and low gas flowrate because the carbon oxidation kinetics becomes limited by oxygen diffusion. At low carbon content in the sample cell the TM is independent of initial carbon concentration at constant initial coke particle size. Essentially the same TM is obtained with both coke concentrations (3 wt.-% and 0.5 wt.-%) when the catalyst mass is small enough (far left hand data points in Fig. 7) and the coke particles in the two catalysts are assumed to have the same initial particle size. Fig. 8 shows TM as a function of coke concentration when the amount of coke initially loaded into the cell is kept constant, i.e., catalyst mass times carbon concentration (w x wt.-% C) is the same at different initial carbon concentrations. This is accomplished by adjusting the catalyst mass according to the initial carbon concentration on the catalyst. In this case, the same initial carbon particle size was assumed and the sample cell contained 0.001 g of coke. This simulation indicates for both orders 1 and 0.5, TM does not depend on carbon concentration. When the oxygen consumption is maintained at the same level for different initial carbon concentration by adjusting the catalyst mass in the sample cell, the 12 shift in the Tm with carbon concentration, observed in Fig. 5, disappears. However, if the increase in carbon concentration corresponds to an increase of carbon particle size, a constant amount of coke loaded into the sample cell still CA. Querini, S.C.

Peak maximum temperature TM, as a function of percentage of coke, at constant coke particle size, at constant amount of coke loaded into the cell (1 mg); leads to a shift in TM with carbon concentration as shown in Fig. 6B, Curve (2). Carbon concentration has a great influence on a TPO spectrum when the carbon particle size changes with carbon concentration, even though a constant catalyst weight or constant amount of coke is in the sample cell. 4.5. Infuence of coke morphology According to previous results and discussions, multi-peak TO spectra could be generated in several ways, all of them with physical significance. At least four different situations result in a multi-peak spectrum: (I) E and A change due to different oxidation properties of the coke deposits. (2) E and A do not change, but coke reaction order changes as a function of wt.o C. This implies that reaction order changes with coke conversion during TPO. (3) E and A do not change, but coke has a particle size distribution. (4) E and A do not change, but coke particles have different geometries. This implies different coke reaction orders. The first case is obvious, and is the situation that has been assumed to be true in the literature on the deconvolution of TPO spectra [ 26,30] . It is interesting to analyze the other three situations, all of them related to coke morphology. 4.5.1. Reaction order as a function of coke conversion As was mentioned earlier, coke reaction order may increase during coke oxidation as a consequence of important changes in the geometry of the coke particles. These changes increase the coke reaction order as coke content decreases. In order to analyze the influence of this factor on a TPO spectrum, simulations were carried out using various relationships between coke reaction order and coke content. Fig. 68 O CA. Querini, S.C.

A carbon reaction order of 0 was assumed for conversions lower than 0.3, then a step, exponential or linear and then step increase up to order 1 were analyzed. The peak with constant order 1 is included as a reference. Fig. 9A clearly shows that the change in the coke reaction order affects the TPO spectrum, changing both the peak height and the peak maximum temperature, TM. Fig. 9B shows another example, obtained with a different initial coke concentration and a different value of conversion above which the carbon reaction order is assumed to change from 0 to 1. The spectrum looks like a multipeak spectrum, with a shoulder at the high temperature side of the main peak. A deconvolution of this spectrum without the knowledge of change in carbon reaction order at high conversion, would produce a wrong analysis, giving two types of coke with two respective pairs of E and A. 4.5.2. Coke particle size distribution Fig. l 0A and 10B show results of simulations of TPO spectra assuming that there are 2 or 3 different particle sizes respectively. As was previously mentioned, for a given geometry of coke particles, different particle sizes produce different TPO spectra because the preexponential factor A;S depends on particle size. Therefore, a coked catalyst containing a distribution of particle size could display a mufti-peak type spectrum, even though there is only one type of coke. In Fig. 10A, two particles sizes were assumed and one of them was 4 times larger than the other. The spectrum seems to be a `two peaks' spectrum. As another example, in Fig. lOB, three different particle radii were used. The whole spectrum shows a shoulder on the high temperature side of the peak. CA. Querini, S.C.

Coke particles with different geometry When the coke is present in the catalyst as particles with different geometry, a complex spectrum may appear. For example, if some coke is in the form of three dimensional particles while another portion of the coke is in a two dimensional structure, the simulated TPO spectrum appears to consist of two peaks even though one set of E and A values is used in the calculation. A smooth shoulder appears at the high temperature side of the main peak in Fig. 11. In this case, carbon reaction 300 O O TEMPERATURE, C Fig. 11.

Influence of oxygen concentration Fig. 12 shows theoretical influence of oxygen concentration on a TPO spectrum. Increasing the inlet concentration of oxygen increases the rate of coke oxidation and, therefore, coke oxidation completes at a lower temperature and an increase in peak height is observed. 5. TPO spectrum deconvolution In order to minimize the influence of non-homogeneity of the coked catalyst due to non-uniform coking, the coked catalyst was homogenized by repeated grinding and mixing to a fine powder before it was compressed and sieved to 60/80 mesh particles, as was described in [ 32] . Reproducibility was excellent by using this method. A TPO spectrum of a 0.6 wt.-% Pt/A1203 obtained under the standard TPO condition, at a heating rate of 13/min with 1.26% coke, was deconvoluted with a linear combination of power law rate expressions. Four peaks were used in this fitting. The four different types of carbons were assumed to have the same reaction order and oxygen reaction order was assumed to be 1. There was an excellent agreement between data calculated from the model and those obtained in the TPO experiment. However, when the kinetic parameters (Table 1) obtained in this fitting are used to predict a TPO spectrum generated under a different set of conditions, the results were poor. To improve the prediction capability of this model, we simultaneously regress 2 independent sets of data. obtained for example, with heating rates of 13/min and CA. Querini, S. C.

This deconvolution was also carried out using Eq. (11) instead of Eq. (4). Results are shown in Table 3. Parameters and fitting quality were both essentially the same in either case. 6. Conclusions Though the simple power law kinetic model does not explicitly describe all the physical processes involve in coke oxidation, it does account for the effect of carbon CA. Querini, S. C. Fung /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 53-74 73 surface area on the coke-burn kinetics. The model provides a physical basis of how experimental conditions and coke properties affect TPO spectra. This should facilitate comparison of TPO data obtained at different conditions. A deconvolution procedure is required to analyze a complex TPO spectrum and to obtain kinetic parameters of the coke-burn process. However, the validity of the kinetic model used in the deconvolution has to be substantiated by its ability to predict TO spectra. The linear combination of power law rate expressions give a good correlation-prediction model in many instances. Occasionally, deconvolution of TPO spectra by this simple model fails to yield the right kinetic parameters which give good prediction of experimental data. This suggests that the multi-peak spectrum might not be the result of different types of coke. It might be the result of a change in carbon reaction order during the coke-burn experiment or a distribution of coke particle size and morphology. Therefore, some prior knowledge of the characteristics and the distribution of the coke deposits is required to set up the right form of the power law rate expression to reflect the physical processes occurring in the coke-burn process. In this regard, electron microscopy investigations of coke morphology and coke particle size should be helpful in determining the extent of these factors influencing a TPO spectrum. 7.

Coke oxidation rates on supported metal catalysts were studied by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The TPO data were successfully modeled with a linear combination of power-law kinetic expressions. The validity and limitations of the model, for carbon oxidation on metal containing catalysts, were analyzed in detail. The influence of heating rate, coke concentration, coke particle size and number, catalyst mass and oxygen concentration on TPO spectra predicted by the model agreed well with experimental results. Coke particle size and morphology have a great influence on a TPO spectrum. Even though this simplified form of kinetic expression does not explicitly account for all the physical phenomena in a coke-burn process, it considers some of the most important factors: the effect of carbon surface area and the promotional effect of supported metals on coke-burn kinetics. Deconvolution of a complex TPO spectrum by the above model provides kinetic parameters which can be used to predict TPO spectra of partial-coke-burn experiments. Difficulties in the predictive capability of this model arrive if other factors such as large variations in coke morphology and coke particle size exist and there is no information relating them to a particular feature in the TPO spectrum. However, the model can adequately account for these variations, if their characteristics and extent are known, e.g., they may be determined by electron microscopy.

        "dc:description": "Coke oxidation rates on supported metal catalysts were studied by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The TPO data were successfully modeled with a linear combination of power-law kinetic expressions. The validity and limitations of the model, for carbon oxidation on metal containing catalysts, were analyzed in detail. The influence of heating rate, coke concentration, coke particle size and number, catalyst mass and oxygen concentration on TPO spectra predicted by the model agreed well with experimental results. Coke particle size and morphology have a great influence on a TPO spectrum. Even though this simplified form of kinetic expression does not explicitly account for all the physical phenomena in a coke-burn process, it considers some of the most important factors: the effect of carbon surface area and the promotional effect of supported metals on coke-burn kinetics.
