Most of them, however, require ultraviolet (UV) irradia- tion to initiate the process because of the wide band gap of the used photocatalysts, raising energy consumption and safety issues [4,5].

Introduction Since the pioneering work of Honda and Fujishima, photocat- alytic water splitting into hydrogen has received much attention due to the economic and environmental promise of the resulting clean fuels [1]. Photocatalytic water splitting can be initiated by incident irradiation,which requires energy equal to, or greater than, one of the main candidates for efficient solar light water splitting [6]. It has attracted intensive interest, because the possible theoret- ical maximum solar conversion efficiency of the photocatalyst is 15.9% [7]. However, the overall water splitting efficiency of the Ta3N5 photocatalyst remains low because of several drawbacks, including fast recombination of the generated electrons and holes, low charge transfer efficiency, and poor stability, because the gen- TAvailable online 24 May 2017 Keywords: Ta3N5 V dopant PANI sensitizer Water splitting Solar fuelsVanadium-doped tantalum nitride sensitized/protected by polyaniline (Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI) was successfully synthesized for efficient photocatalytic water splitting under visible light. The vanadium was used as a dopant incorporated into the Ta3N5 lattice, where it acted as an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of Ta3N5 to narrow the band gap energy of Ta3N5. This intermediate band of the V dopant also enhanced the electronâ€“hole pair separation efficiency and prevented the recombi- nation of the generated electrons and holes, thereby extending the lifetime of the electronâ€“hole pairs. PANI, a conducting polymer with an extended pâ€“pâ�„ conjugated electron system, was used as a sensi- tizer/protector covering the V-doped Ta3N5 particles to enhance the charge transfer efficiency for migra- tion of the photogenerated electrons and holes to the photocatalyst surface. The PANI cover also prevented Ta3N5 from oxidizing the generated holes (self photocorrosion). As a result, the synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI material exhibited very high photocatalytic activity for water splitting, producing H2 and O2 even under visible light. The production rates of H2 and O2 generated from water splitting by Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were 745 and 370 (mmol g 1cat h 1), respectively. 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental2.1. Materials synthesis Ta3N5 was synthesized by heating Ta2O5 powder (Sigma- Aldrich, 99.9%) in a quartz tube reactor under a flow of ammonia gas at 1000 C for 10 h. To synthesize V-doped Ta3N5 (V-Ta3N5), Ta2O5 powder was added into a 0.05 M NH4VO3 solution. The weight of Ta2O5 and the volume of NH4VO3 solution were calcu- lated to ensure that the V/Ta atomic percentage was 5%. Then the mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h and stirred for 24 h to obtain a uniform suspension. The suspension was dried in an oven at 200 C for 24 h. The obtained powder was also calcined for 10 h in a quartz tube reactor under a flow of ammonia gas at 1000 C to obtain Vâ€“Ta3N5 material. To synthesize Ta3N5 sensitized/pro- tected by PANI (Ta3N5/PANI) and V-Ta3N5 sensitized/protected by PANI (V-Ta3N5/ PANI), the synthesized Ta3N5 and V-Ta3N5 were respectively dispersed in deionized water with stirring for 30 min. Then, designed amount of aniline was added to the above mixture with ultrasonication for another 30 min, after which 0.5 M ammonium peroxydisulfate solution was added dropwise into the mixture as an oxidant for polymerization of the aniline. Then, the obtained suspension was filtered. Finally, the precipitates were washed with water, acetone and ethanol and then dried at 80 C for 10 h to obtain Ta3N5/PANI and V-Ta3N5/PANI. The weight percentages of PANI/Ta3N5 in both Ta3N5/PANI and V-Ta3N5/PANI were 5%. PANI was also synthesized under the same conditions except for the presence of Ta3N5 or V-Ta3N5 for comparison. 2.2. Photocatalyst characterization R E T Rmaterial [17]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet used V as a dopant for Ta3N5. In our previous study, we used V as a dopant for the TiO2 lattice [18]. The V dopant migrated to the TiO2 lattice, leading to formation of Ti3+ and V4+, which increased the electronâ€“hole pair separation efficiency and generation capac- ity and also prevented the recombination of generated electrons and holes of the TiO2, which in turn enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. In the present study, we therefore used V as a dopant in the Ta3N5 lattice because of its ability to migrate to the Ta3N5 lattice (similar to the role played by the V dopant in the TiO2 lattice) to enhance its photocatalytic activity for efficient solar light water splitting. Recently, conducting polymers with extended p-conjugated electron systems, such as polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene, poly- pyrrole, and their derivatives, have been reported as promising sensitizers to increase the visible light response of photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, and CdSe, because of their high visible light absorption coefficients, high charge transfer efficiency, and excel- lent stability [19â€“22]. Thus, the second aim of the study is to use PANI to sensitize the V-doped Ta3N5 photocatalyst in order to increase the charge transfer efficiency, prevent the recombination of the generated electrons and holes of the V-doped Ta3N5 system, and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials for efficient solar light water splitting. The increase in charge transfer efficiency is also expected to prevent the self pho- tocorrosion of Ta3N5 in electrolyte solution (or enhance the stabil- ity of Ta3N5) because the generated holes of the V-doped Ta3N5 system can be quickly transferred to the PANI surface, and there- fore cannot oxidize nitrides in Ta3N5.from 2.1 eV (bare Ta3N5) to 1.75 eV (W-doped Ta3N5), which 14 T.-D. Pham et al. / Journal oThe pristine Ta2O5, PANI, and the synthesized tantalum-based materials were analyzed by a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha X-ray photo-3. Results and discussion 3.1. Materials characteristics 3.1.1. Crystalline structure and morphology Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of pristine Ta2O5, synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. The main diffraction peaks observed at 2h values of 22.9 , 28.3 , 28.8 , 36.7 , and 46.9 indicate that the pristine Ta2O5 existed in the form of orthorhombic Ta2O5 (JCPDS 25-0922) [23]. The XRD pattern of the synthesized Ta3N5 corresponds to the typical XRD pattern of Ta3N5 [24]. No impurity peak was observed in the XRD pattern, indicating that Ta2O5 was completely nitrided to Ta3N5. As com- pared with the XRD pattern of the synthesized Ta3N5, the XRD pat- tern of the synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5 shows a shift in the peak position toward smaller diffraction angles, accompanied by a peak broaden- ing. This was due to the migration of the V dopant to the Ta3N5 lat- tice, where it was incorporated [25]. The diffraction lines in the XRD patterns of Ta3N5/PANI and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were similar to those of Ta3N5 and Vâ€“Ta3N5, respectively. This indicates that PANI2.3. Experimental system A continuous gas system was designed for photocatalytic water splitting experiments. First, 0.2 g of synthesized photocatalyst was added into a 350 mL top and bottom quartz reactor containing 200 mL deionized water. An external cooling system was set up in the reactor sidewall to maintain the temperature of the reactor. The reactor was put into a reaction chamber, which was a cask with a dark cover. White light bulbs (EFTR 20EX-D, Kumho Co., Ltd) were placed at the top and bottom of the reaction chamber to generate visible light in the range 400â€“700 nm. Before irradia- tion, the reactor was thoroughly degassed with N2 and Ar in order to drive off the air inside. The light bulbs were turned on to gener- ate visible light with a power density of 0.1 W/cm2 for photocat- alytic water splitting when the residual air content in the reactor was confirmed to be negligible. The produced gases were collected by an online sampling loop (1 mL) at intervals of 30 min and ana- lyzed by a gas chromatography (GC) system (a thermal conductive detector equipped with a 3.5 m long molecular sieve 5A packed column with Ar as carrier gas). C T Eelectron spectrometer (XPS) system. The XPS spectra were fitted by Gaussian multipeak shapes to characterize the elemental states of the vanadium, tantalum, and nitrogen in the materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the photocatalysts were obtained using a Bruker AXN model equipped with a Cu-Ka radiation source (k = 1.5418 Ã…) and operated at a scan rate of 0.02 s 1 over the 2h range 15â€“55 . A JEOL TEM-2010F system was used to obtain trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR- TEM) images of the synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. The optical absorp- tion ability of the synthesized photocatalysts was characterized by an Evolution 300 spectrophotometer (UV-1700 Shimadzu). Photo- electrochemical measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell using Pt and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as coun- ter and reference electrodes, respectively. The synthesized material was dispersed in a dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution (1 mg sam- ple/0.1 mL DMF). Then the mixture was sonicated to obtain a slurry, which was spread onto FTO conductive glass to prepare the working electrode. To improve adhesion, the working electrode was further dried at 373 K for 2 h. Current response was measured with a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte (pH 6.8). talysis 352 (2017) 13â€“21 Ddid not affect the crystalline structure of the Ta3N5 and Vâ€“Ta3N5 particles. The TEM and HRTEM results of Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI show that PANI existed as a nanolayer covering the Vâ€“Ta3N5 particles (Fig. 2). result that Ta2O5 was completely nitrided to Ta3N5. The peaks observed at 397.1 and 397.9 eV in the XPS spectra of Vâ€“Ta3N5 cor- were smaller than the @NA fractions. The remarkable decrease in the ANHA- fractions, accompanied by a slight increase in the NATa fractions, was because nitrogen in the ANHA could bond with Ta in Ta3N5 to form Nâ€“Ta bonding, which chemically attached PANI to Ta3N5 (or Vâ€“Ta3N5). 3.1.3. Optical properties Fig. 4 shows the optical absorption spectra of the pristine Ta2O5 and the synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/ PANI. Based on the optical absorption spectra, we used a Tauc plot combined with the Kubelkaâ€“Munk method to estimate the band gap energies of the photocatalysts (Fig. 5) [28,29]. In the Tauc plot of a material, a linear fit is drawn from the transformed curves to the photon energy axis (hm) and the energy value at the point of intersection of the line and the horizontal axis represents the band gap energies of the materials. The results indicated that the pris- tine Ta2O5 only absorbed UV light, which has a wavelength of less T.-D.

This means that the V dopant was incorporated into the Ta3N5 lattice and existed in the form of the Vâ€“N bonds. The XPS spectra of the synthesized PANI indicate that RThis also confirms that PANI did not affect the crystalline structure of Ta3N5. Thus, the synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI was composed of two different layers: a nano PANI layer covering the V-doped Ta3N5 particles. 3.1.2. Elemental states Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of N1s and Ta4p3/2 in Ta2O5, Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, PANI, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. The occurrence of a N1s peak in the XPS spectra of Ta3N5 confirms that Ta2O5 was suc- cessfully nitrided to Ta3N5. In addition, the N/Ta atomic ratio, which is proportional to the ratio (area under the N peak)/(area under the Ta peak) in the XPS spectra, is approximately 1.6, which is close to the Ta3N5 stoichiometry [26]. This also confirms the XRD Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the pristine Ta2O5 and the synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI.nitrogen in the material existed in forms of pyrrolic N (@NH@) and pyridinic N (@NA) [19]. In the synthesized PANI, the @NH@ frac- tion was larger than the @NA fraction (Fig. 3). However, in both synthesized Ta3N5/PANI and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI, the ANHA fractions Fig. 2. TEM and HRTEM images of t R E Tthan 325 nm, with a band gap energy of approximately 3.8 eV. As compared with the pristine Ta2O5, the synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“ Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI exhibited significantly enhanced visible light absorption. The synthesized Ta3N5 could absorb a certain amount of visible light with a band gap energy of approximately 2.1 eV, corresponding to a typical band gap energy of Ta3N5. The visible light absorption of both Vâ€“Ta3N5 and Ta3N5/PANI was higher than that of Ta3N5. This indicated that both the V dopant and the PANI sensitizer enhanced the visible light adsorption of Ta3N5. The V dopant incorporated into the Ta3N5 lat- tice could act as an intermediate band between the VB and the CB of Ta3N5 (Fig. 6). Therefore, the low energy levels provided by inci- dent visible light could be utilized (Vâ€“Ta3N5 absorbed the incident visible light) to transfer electrons from the VB (N2p) to the inter- mediate band of V3d, and finally to the CB (Ta5d) [30]. Thus, the visible light absorption efficiency of Vâ€“Ta3N5 was higher than that of Ta3N5. The PANI covering Ta3N5 could also absorb a certain amount of visible light to induce the pâ€“pâ�„ transition, thereby transporting the electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PANI (Fig. 6). Ta3N5/PANI could also absorb visible light for electron transfer from the VB of Ta3N5 to the HUMO of PANI and from the LUMO of PANI to the CB of Ta3N5 [20]. The visible light absorption of Ta3N5/PANI was higher than that of Vâ€“Ta3N5, indicat- ing that the PANI sensitizer was better than the V dopant at enhancing the visible light absorption of Ta3N5. However, the band gap energy of Vâ€“Ta3N5 was lower than that of Ta3N5/PANI (Fig. 5) because V was incorporated into the Ta3N5 lattice, while PANI only C E Dhe synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. Fig. 3.

Pham et al. / Journal of Ca R E R Atalysis 352 (2017) 13â€“21covered the Ta3N5 particles. Therefore, the V dopant directly nar- rowed the gap between the VB and the CB of Ta3N5, which is the band gap energy of the material, rather than PANI, which combined with Ta3N5 to form a hybrid system, resulting in an indirect narrowing of the band gap energy of the Ta3N5 material. The syn- thesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI material exhibited the best optical absorp- tion ability and the lowest band gap energy, because it could utilize the advantages of both the V dopant and the PANI sensitizer. 3.1.4. Photoelectrochemical properties The current response is a useful basis for evaluating the elec- tronâ€“hole pair separation efficiency of a photocatalyst [31]. Fig. 7A shows the current density of Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI as a function of the applied potential (vs. NHE) under dark and visible light con- ditions. Under dark conditions, a flat current signal was obtained, indicating that the synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI could not generate electronâ€“hole pairs in the dark. However, under visible light condi- tions, Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI exhibited a certain current response, indicat- ing that a significant number of electronâ€“hole pairs was generated. 5% Vâ€“Ta3N5, PANI, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI.

The results indicated that the pristine Ta2O5 did not show any current response under either dark or vis- ible light conditions. However, the current signal of the synthe- sized Ta3N5 and the modified Ta3N5 exhibited a sharp increase and decrease with light on and light off, respectively. This was because Ta3N5 and modified Ta3N5 could strongly absorb visible light, leading to the formation of electronâ€“hole pairs and indicating the excellent photoelectrochemical activity of the synthesized materials [32]. The current densities of the synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“ Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI under visible light were 39.5, 53.5, 70, and 80 mA cm 2, respectively. Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI exhib- ited the highest current density, because the V dopant and the PANI sensitizer in the materials narrowed the band gap and Fig. 5. Tauc plot of the pristine Ta2O5 and the synthesiz R E T R Atalysis 352 (2017) 13â€“21 17enhanced the charge transfer efficiency, respectively, which greatly increased the electronâ€“hole separation efficiency of Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. 3.2. Water splitting 3.2.1. Novel overall water splitting The pristine Ta2O5 and the synthesized Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/ PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were used for overall water splitting under both dark and visible light conditions. The results show that the pristine Ta2O5 could not split water under either dark or visible light conditions. This was due to the wide band gap of Ta2O5. The synthesized Ta3N5 and the modified Ta3N5 could not split water under dark conditions, either. However, under visible light condi- tion, a significant amount of H2 and O2 was produced from water splitting by the synthesized Ta3N5 and the modified Ta3N5, due ed Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI.

This was because the generated electrons and holes need a certain time to reach the density necessary to carry out the reac- tion [34]. Fig. 8B shows the production rates of H2 and O2 produced from water splitting by Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/ PANI after they were irradiated for 4 h with visible light (when the production rate was stable). The production rates of H2 and O2 were clearly in a stoichiometric ratio of 2 to 1, which demon- strated that overall water splitting was achieved in the tested pho- tocatalytic system. The production rates from water splitting by the synthesized materials were in the order Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI > Ta3N5/PANI > Vâ€“Ta3- N5 > Ta3N5. The experimental results totally agreed with the char- acterization properties previously obtained, indicating that Vâ€“ Ta3N5/PANI was the most suitable candidate for water splitting among the tested materials.

Pham et al. / Journalincorporated into the Ta3N5 lattice narrowed the band gap of Ta3N5, enhanced the electronâ€“hole pair separation efficiency, and also prevented the recombination of the generated electrons and holes, thus increasing the formation and lifetime of the electronâ€“ hole pairs. As compared with the V dopant, the PANI sensitizer, a conducting material covering Ta3N5, could not only narrow the band gap energy of Ta3N5, thereby enhancing the electronâ€“hole pair separation efficiency, but also prevent the recombination of the generated electrons and holes by enhancing the charge transfer efficiency for improved migration of the generated electrons and holes to the photocatalyst surface. Therefore, the water splitting efficiency of Ta3N5/PANI was higher than that of Vâ€“Ta3N5. The syn- thesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI material exhibited the highest water split- Fig. 8.

The production rates of H2 and O2 generated from water splitting by Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were 745 and 370 mmol g 1cat h 1, respectively. 3.2.2. Photocatalyst stability Recycling experiments on the photocatalysts were to analyze the stability of the synthesized materials during water splitting processes. For the recycling experiments, the photocatalysts, which were used for water splitting for 5 h, were collected by filtration and then vacuum-dried for 2 h before being used for the next cycles. Fig. 9A shows the total production rates of H2 and O2 (at s I irradiated with visible light for 300 min (A) and from water splitting of Ta3N5, Vâ€“ t (B). ) and the XPS spectra of Ta3N5 before and after five cycles of water splitting (B). C T E D f Ca Astable value) generated from water splitting of Ta3N5, Vâ€“Ta3N5, Ta3N5/PANI, and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI. The production rates from water splitting by Ta3N5/PANI and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were almost unchanged over five cycles, which demonstrated the great stability of the materials. However, the production rates from water splitting by Ta3N5 and Vâ€“Ta3N5 were significantly decreased, possibly due to the self photocorrosion of Ta3N5 and Vâ€“Ta3N5. The photogenerated holes could oxidize nitride in Ta3N5 to form Ta2O5 according to the following equation [35]: 2Ta3N5 Ã¾ 30hÃ¾ Ã¾ 30 OH! Ta2O5 Ã¾ 5N2 Ã¾ 15H2O: Ã°4Ãž Fig. 9B shows the XPS spectra of Ta3N5 before it was used for the first cycle and after five-cycles of water splitting. The intensity of the N1s peak of Ta3N5 after five cycles was much lower than that of Ta3N5 before the water splitting. This confirmed the proposed theory that the nitrides of Ta3N5 and Vâ€“Ta3N5 were oxidized during the water splitting experiment. When Ta3N5/PANI and Vâ€“Ta3N5/ PANI were used for water splitting, PANI, which covered Ta3N5 and the Vâ€“Ta3N5 particles, facilitated charge transfer for quick migration of the generated electrons and holes to its surface and thus prevented contact between the holes and nitride of Ta3N5. Zhang et al. reported that PANI is not decomposed by holes or hydroxyl radicals [36]. Therefore, Ta3N5/PANI and Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI were stable during long-term water splitting. This could open up a new era for the application of these mate- rials in the commercial production of hydrogen and oxygen. 4. Conclusions The synthesized Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI exhibited very high photocat- alytic activity for the production of H2 and O2 by water splitting even under visible light. This was because the V dopant incorpo- rated into the Ta3N5 lattice narrowed the band gap energy of Ta3N5, thereby enhancing the electronâ€“hole pair separation effi- ciency, preventing the recombination of the generated electrons and holes and thus increasing their lifetime. The HOMO and LUMO bands in the PANI sensitizer also combined with the VB and the CB of Vâ€“Ta3N5 to form a hybrid system. In the hybridized system, elec- tronâ€“hole pairs could be separated easily even under visible light. The PANI conducting material also enhanced charge transfer for migration of the generated electrons and holes to the photocatalyst surface and thus protected Ta3N5 from oxidation of the generated holes. Therefore, even under visible light, the synthesized Vâ€“ Ta3N5/PANI generated a significant number of electronâ€“hole pairs that participated in the reaction with H2O to produce H2 and O2. Thus, the Vâ€“Ta3N5/PANI material exhibited very high photocat- alytic activity for water splitting to produce H2 and O2. The ability of the covering layer of the PANI sensitizer to increase the stability and lifetime of the Ta3N5 or Vâ€“Ta3N5 particles promises to open up a new era in commercial application of photocatalysis for efficient solar hydrogen production.
