The effect of the post-condition on the structure, surface properties of the catalysts and their precursors as well as the catalytic activities for methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation have been studied. The results showed that the washing with ethanol or drying directly derived a large specific surface area, highly dispersion ultrafine Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts, which exhibited a higher catalytic activity and optimum methanol selectivity for methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation.

Introduction In the end of 1960s, a low pressure-low temperature methanol synthesis catalyst was introduced by ICI [1], which was based on copper-containing system such as Cu/ZnO/A1203 with various compositions. Since then, many studies and discus- sions focus on the role of copper, on which the catalytic reaction of CO(CO2) hydrogenation to form methanol could take place. It was found that the particle size, surface area, metallic copper surface area and composition of Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalyst are important factors to the catalytic process. A linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the metallic copper surface area of the catalyst was * Corresponding author.

Pll S0926- 860X(96)003 62-6 106 Y Zhang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 105-120 proposed by Chinchen et al. [2,3]. In our previous work [4], it was observed that the catalytic activity of methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide hydrogenation increased with increasing metallic copper surface area for Cu/ZnO/A1203 ternary catalysts until it reaches a maximum and decreases at Cu/ZnO=8 (molar ratio). In recent years, various methods have been developed to prepare Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts with larger surface area and copper surface area, fine particle size and optimized compositions, which was believed to have a high catalytic activity for methanol synthesis from CO(CO2) hydrogenation. Tanaka and co-workers [5] prepared Cu/ZnO binary catalyst from a solution of copper zinc nitrates dissolved in ethylene glycol. It was found that the selectivity to methanol was highest when the ratio of copper to zinc was 1. The active sites were concluded to be copper atoms in contact with crystallites. Raney copper catalysts have been prepared and studied by Yong et al. [6-11]. The activities of the catalysts in the low pressure range were comparable to that of the commercial Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts. In the studies of Zr/Cu, Ti/Cu, and RE/Zr/Cu, RE/Ti/Cu alloys catalysts [ 12], prepared by electron beam melting of an appropriate amount of the constituent metals, it has been shown that the rate of methanol synthesis over Zr/Cu and Ti/Cu catalysts can be substantially enhanced by the addition of RE compounds (RE=rare earth or yttrium). Cu/ThO2 [13,14] catalyst prepared from the binary alloy ThCu6 is more active than those Cu/ZnO/AI203 catalysts used in industry. Nitta [15] prepared Cu/ZrO2, Cu/ZrO2/ZnO catalysts with coprecipitation method. It was found that the addition of ZnO to Cu/ZrO2 catalyst of Cu : ZrO2= 1 : 1 (weight ratio) greatly enhanced the activity at low temperatures, while keeping the high methanol selectivity of Cu/ZrO2. Sun [ 16] reported that Cu/ZrO2 areogel catalyst prepared by supercritical drying method was highly active and stable in methanol synthesis reaction from carbon monoxide hydrogenation. In this work, a series of Cu/ZnO/ A1203 catalysts were prepared with a novel oxalate gel-coprecipitation method for investigating their nature and reactivity in CO/CO2 hydrogenation. The influence of post-treatment conditions on the structure of the catalysts and catalytic activity was studied. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts were prepared with an oxalate gel-coprecipitation method similar to the previous report [4]. A typical procedure to prepare the precursor of the catalysts is as follows: Oxalic acid and mixed salts of copper nitrate, zinc nitrate and aluminum nitrate (molar ratio of Cu, Zn and A1 is 6 : 3 : 1) were dissolved in ethanol, respectively. The ethanol solution of oxalic acid was rapidly added to the mixed solution of metal nitrates at 298 K under vigorous stirring. A gel-like precipitate was formed and separated by centrifuge, then Y. Zhang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 105-120 107 divided into four portions. A typical precipitate was dried at 383 K under flowing air condition (CZA01); the others were washed three time with ethanol (CZA02) or with deionised water (CZA03), respectively, then dried at 383 K under flowing air condition. For comparison, another precipitate was dried at 298 K under vacuum condition (CZA04). All precipitates were crashed into powders and calcined in a muffle oven under an optimum condition and then kept at 623 K for 4 h. The oxide samples were pelletized and then broken to a uniform 40~60 and 10~20 mesh sizes for catalytic activity testing in both the microreactor and small reactor, respectively. 2.2. Characterization TG/DTG was carried out in open air with a heating rate of 5 K min ~ using a Dupont 951 thermogravimetric analyzer. XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Dmax-rA X-ray diffractometer with CuKc~ radiation. The specific surface area and pore-size distributions were determined with N2 BET method using a Micromeritics ASAP2000 automatic physical adsorption apparatus. TEM mea- surements were performed using a Hitachi H600 Scan-transmission microscope. The specific areas of metallic copper were measured using nitrous oxide titration method similar to that described by Evans et al. [ 17]. The catalysts were reduced in a flowing premixed H2/Ar (5/95) before the measurement of the copper metallic area. N2 was used as a carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector for measuring the consumption of N20. Copper metal surface areas were calculated assuming 1.461019 copper atoms per m2 [17]. 2.3. Measurement of catalytic activity The catalytic activities of Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 were tested using a continuous tubular flow fixed-bed microreactor. The catalyst sample (40~60 mesh size, 0.5 ml) was packed in a stainless steel reactor (i.d.=6.0 mm) and reduced in a premixed H2/Ar (5/95) flOW of 40 ml/min (NTP). The temperature was raised to 513 K at a heating rate of 2 K min- 1 and held for 10h. After the reduction, the gas flow was switched to the reactant gas (CO : CO2 : H2=20.5 : 5 : 74.5), and then the reaction pressure was gradually increased to 2.0 MPa. The flow rate of the reactant gas was controlled by a mass flow controller and measured by a bubble meter. The products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a 2 m long Propak Q column and thermal conductivity detector. The catalytic activity of CZA01 was also evaluated in a stainless steel pressur- ized continuous tubular flow fixed-bed small reactor (i.d.= 18 mm). The tempera- ture in the reactor was monitored and controlled by two chromel-alumel thermocouples through a microcomputer. It can be held to within 0.2 K of the described level. The gas flow was controlled by a mass sensor flow controller and 108 Y Zhang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 105-120 the pressure was monitored by a pre- and back pressure regulator. Five milliliters catalyst (10~20 mesh with a mean particle size of 2.5 mm) was mixed with silica grains of similar size in a ratio of 1 : 2 and packed in the small reactor. The catalyst was activated in a flowing hydrogen flow of 450 ml min 1 (NTP). The temperature was increased at a heating rate of 0.2 K rain-1 from room temperature to 513 K, then kept constant for 12 h. After the reduction, hydrogen gas was replaced by the syngas (CO : CO2 : H2--33.0 : 1.0 : 66.0) and then pressurized slowly to 5.0 MPa. The products were collected by ice-water bath every 4 h. The amount of outlet gas was measured at atmospheric pressure using a wet gas meter and sampled with a gas-bag every 4 h. Both outlet gas and liquid samples were analyzed by a gas chromatograph. The conversion of carbon, selectivity and yield of methanol were calculated according to the flow of syngas and outlet gas as well as the weight of methanol. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization The XRD patterns of the precursors of the catalysts post-treated and dried under various conditions are shown in Fig. 1. It shows that only two phases (c~- ZnC204-2H20 and CuC2Oa.xH20) are observed in the patterns. I3-ZnC204 appear- ing in the precipitate prepared by the conventional oxalate coprecipitation method [4] is not detected here. This indicates that the structure and morphology of the precipitates prepared by the oxalate gel coprecipitation method are significantly different from those observed from the conventional oxalate coprecipitation method. It is also interesting to notice that the diffraction peak of ce-ZnC204.2H20 varies with the post-treat conditions. The precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts exhibit a similar diffraction patterns, on which only diffraction peak of CuC204.xH20 are observed, while the diffraction lines of c~-ZnC2On.2H20 in the precursors of CZA03 and CZA04 catalysts are sharper and stronger than that of o~-ZnC204.2H20 in the precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts. This can be attributed to the fact, suggesting in our previous work [4], that the isomorphous substitution between copper and zinc in the precipitate prepared by the oxalate gel coprecipitation method. It was believed that a considerable amount of the zinc was incorporated into the structure of CuC204-xH20 in these oxalate precipitates. The increase in intensity of the diffraction peak of c~-ZnC204.2H20 in the precursors of CZA03 and CZA04 catalysts indicates that the fraction of c~-ZnC204.2H20 incorporating into the structure of CuC204\"xH20 could be decreased. This is further supported by the results of thermal gravimetric (TG/DTG) analysis. Fig. 2 shows the DTG spectra of the precursors of various catalysts. It shows that three weight-loss peaks are observed at 394.7, 581.9, and 617.4 K for the precursor of CZA03 catalyst, respectively. They can be assigned to the desorption of physically Y.

Two weight-loss peaks at about 387, 569.2 and 615.5 K are observed for the precursor of CZA04 catalyst. While only one weight-loss peak at about 574.5 K is obtained for the precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts. This result indicates that there are obvious differences in the structure of precursors of various catalysts. The fact that only one weight-loss peak is found for the precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts indicates that these precipitate is in single phase and most of zinc is incorporated into the CuCaO4 phase. Namely, the isomorphous substitution take place between copper and zinc in the precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts. By analyzing above, it is revealed that the washing with ethanol has no influence on the structure of the gel oxalate precipitate. The observation of two or three weight- 110 Y.

DTG spectra of the precursors of the catalysts: (a) CZA01; (b) CZA02; (c) CZA03; (d) CZA04. loss peaks for the precursors of CZA03 and CZA04 catalysts indicates that copper and zinc exist in two phases (i.e. a-ZnC204.2H20 and CuC204\"xH20) and the isomorphous substitution taking place in the oxalate gel coprecipitate is reduced. These are in good agreement with the result from XRD. As an explanation, it can be attributed to following reasons: CuC2Oa.xH20 is crystal disorder along b0 direction, it presents as zeolitic type (Moolooite) and isomorphous substitution of copper and zinc is promised in the oxalate coprecipitate when the water content is in the range of 0<x<l. Consequently, only one X-ray diffraction peak and one weight-loss peak are expected for the precursors of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts because no water was added into the precipitates. When the precipitate was washed with deionised water, x in the CuC2Oa'xH20 phase increased and CuC204\"xH20 became a relatively well-developed crystal, reducing the isomorphous substitution. While the oxalate precipitate was dried directly under vacuum condition at 298 K, the ethanol covered on the surface of the precipitate was first removed and the residual water (came from the coordinated water of the nitrates of copper, zinc and aluminum and oxalic acid) was difficult to be removed under this condition, and it led to a well-developed crystal of CuC204\"xH20 structure since the CuC204.xH20 zeolitic structure is only stable at water-less condition. These differences in the structures of the precursors could led to the variation in the structures of the catalysts after calcination. The surface areas and metallic copper areas of the various Cu/ZnO/A1203 samples are listed in Table 1. The CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts have much higher surface areas and metallic copper areas than those of CZA03 and CZA04. It indicates that the post-treatment has a significant influence on the dispersion and particle size of CuO and ZnO in the mixed oxide. It may be caused by the following reasons: When the precipitates were washed with deionised water, the residual Z Zhang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 105-120 111 Table 1 Properties of Cu/ZnO/AI203 catalysts Catalyst Molar ratio Post-treatment SBET rv Scu dcu Cu : Zn : AI and drying condition (m2 g l) (nm) (m2 g cat 1) (nm) CZA01 60 : 30 : l0 Air flowing, dried at 63.58 14.52 36.1 10.70 383 K overnight CZA02 60 : 30 : 10 Ethanol washed, 54.54 13.95 36.8 10.41 dried at 383 K overnight CZA03 60 : 30 : 10 Water washed, 33.88 11.24 11.88 31.90 dried at 383 K overnight CZA04 60 : 30 : 10 Dried at 298 K 47.41 13.87 12.46 30.42 under vacuum condition ethanol over surface of the precipitates was replaced by the water. It is well known that the surface tension of water is greater than that of ethanol (~298[H20]=71.9 mN m-1 and ~298[C2HsOH]z21.8 mN m-l). This stronger ten- sion leads to the serious shrinkage in the volume and microstructure collapsing of the precipitates. In addition, the reduction of isomorphous substitution and the formation of the relatively well-developed crystal of oxalates cause an serious sinter of oxide particle during calcination process, known as the earthquake effect. Therefore, when these precipitates were dried and calcined, the particles of CuO and ZnO aggregated and became large, the surface area and metallic copper area decreased. The XRD patterns of the oxide samples are shown in Fig. 3. All the peaks for the samples of CZA01, CZA02 are broader than those of CZA03 and CZA04, indicating that the very fine particles of CuO and ZnO were formed under the corresponding drying and calcination condition. The observation of the narrower and sharper diffraction peaks of the oxide sample of CZA03 and CZA04 catalysts reveals that the crystalline sizes in the catalysts are larger than those in CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts. It is also seen from Fig. 3 that the diffraction lines of ZnO and CuO overlap at 3420<37for the oxide samples of CZA01 and CZA02 catalysts. Although this result cannot be used to determine if part of copper is substituted into the ZnO phase, at least it is suggested that the particle sizes of CuO and ZnO are much smaller and the copper and zinc in the catalysts exhibit amorphous-like or less ordered structural feature. The relatively strong interaction exists between CuO and ZnO with much smaller particle-sizes, amorphous-like or less ordered structures as like the previous suggestion [ 18-21 ]. TEM photographs are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that CZA01 catalysts consist of clusters of interconnected particles with size of 8~15 nm. The particle size of CZA03 catalyst is larger than that of CZA01 catalyst, further showing that the post-treatment (i.e. washing with deionised water) has an important influence on the structure and dispersion of the catalyst. This result is also consistent with the observation in our XRD and surface area and copper metallic area studies. 112 Y.

CZA01 and CZA02 had higher methanol production than those of CZA03 and CZA04. It is also found that the catalytic activity is quite similar between CZA01 and CZA02 catalyst although the precursors of the catalysts were dried under different post-treatment conditions. However, it can be attributed to the similarity in the surface area, metallic copper area or the particle size and their microstructure for CZA01 and CZA02. A possible explanation for the similarity of those surface properties and structure between CZA01 and CZA02 catalyst could be as follows: The surface of the original precipitates prepared by the oxalate gel coprecipitation was covered mainly by the ethanol, when the precipitates were washed by ethanol, those residual ethanol on the surface of precipitates was only replaced by fresh ethanol. Therefore, the structure and surface properties would not change during drying and calcining processes. It is well known that the hydrogenation of CO or CO2 over Cu/ZnO/A1203 or supported copper catalysts is a structure sensitive reaction. It is believed that similar structure and surface properties lead to a similar catalytic behavior. The catalytic activity results of the CZA01 catalyst tested in the small reactor (5 ml catalyst was mounted) are listed in Table 3. The yield of methanol at the pressure of 5.0 MPa, temperature of 513 K and space velocity (SV) of 10 000 h-1 attains 1.31 g ml cat-1 h-1 within the first 10 h of reaction time, and the selectivity to methanol reaches 99.2%. The activity then gradually declines to a stable value of 1.18 g ml cat-1 h-1 (see Fig. 8), which is still much higher than that previous reported [1]. It is well known that copper (metallic copper or Cu is recognized as an essential component of the active site. Some studies have demonstrated that for a given type of catalyst and a given synthesis gas composition, the methanol formation rate is proportional to the metallic copper area [2,3,22]. Klier [23] considered that the active site is the partly oxidized copper dissolved in the ZnO lattice. Burch [24] believed that there is a strong synergy between copper and ZnO with the area specific rate of Cu/ZnO catalysts being one order of magnitude higher than that of a Cu/SiO2 catalyst. In our previous experiment, the influence of metallic copper area on the rate of methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation appeared to be significant [4]. The activities increased with the increase of the metallic copper area in a non-linear correlation. The activities decrease in spite of higher specific copper area when copper content exceeded 80%. By comparing the results of XRD, TEM, metallic copper surface area and specific surface area of various catalysts, it can be found that CZA01, CZA02 catalysts with a high dispersion, large metallic copper area and specific surface area catalyst exhibit higher activities than those of CZA03 and CZA04 catalyst. As a result, it is believed that a higher metallic copper area (finer particle size of metal copper) results in a higher activity for Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalyst.

Zhang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 105-120 CuO and ZnO particles (exhibit as amorphous-like or less-ordered structure) were formed after calcination, in which a relative strong interaction may exist between copper and zinc [ 18-21 ]. This synergy could have an important promoter action on the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalyst. The reactions involved in the methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation are shown in the following equations: CO(g) + 2Hz(g) -- CH3OH(g), AH298 = -90.64 kJ mo1-1, AG298 = -25.34 kJ mol-l (1) CO2(g) + 3H2(g) = CH3OH(g) + HzO(g), AHz9s = -49.47 kJmo1-1, AG298 = 3.30 kJmo1-1 (2) CO(g) + H20(g) ~ CO2(g) + Hz(g), AHzgs ---- -41.17 kJmo1-1, AG298 = -28.64 kJmol 1 (3) The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide produces water and methanol, as shown in reaction (2). Both carbon monoxide and dioxide take part in reaction (3). Reactions (2) and (3) combined are equivalent to reaction (1). Many previous works [2,3,23] have been carried out to elucidate the role of CO2 in this catalytic reaction system. Klier [23] considered that CO2 only adjusts or controls the surface composition, oxidation state, and dispersion of CuO in the catalyst, but not as a direct reactant. A conflicting conclusion is suggested by Chinchen [2,3] who observed that methanol was formed solely through CO2 hydrogenation. However, other researchers [25] reported that both CO and CO2 can be hydrogenated to methanol and the predominant reaction depends on the operating conditions. Fig. 5 shows the methanol formation rates for feed gases containing only CO2 and H2 (1/3), containing only CO and Hz (1/2) as well as a containing CO/CO2 mixture and H2 (20.5/5/74.5). It shows that both the methanol formation rates for the individual CO and CO2 hydrogenation are much lower than that for CO/CO2 mixture hydrogenation, and the methanol formation rate for CO hydrogenation is lower than that for CO2 at 499 K, which indicates that CO2 promotes the methanol formation remarkably. It is worthy of note that the fraction of CO2 in the outlet gas for various catalysts under all reaction conditions retains a similar level (see Fig. 6), and the ratio of CO to CO2 under higher SV with various reaction temperatures is higher than that of lower SV (see Fig. 7). Based on above results, the following mechanism is proposed: For hydrogenation of CO/CO2 on Cu/ZnO/ A1203 catalysts, carbon dioxide can be the starting point for methanol synthesis via reaction (2). Water produced in reaction (2) reacts rapidly with CO to form CO2. As the reactant gas, it is further converted to methanol via reaction (2). In this reaction system, reaction (3) is considered as a fast equilibrium shift reaction, which even can attain the thermodynamic equilibrium under various reaction conditions. Reaction (2) may be the rate-determining step in methanol synthesis.

Since the CO/HE mixture cannot undergo the water-gas shift reaction (3) when water is not present and the methanol formation rate from CO hydrogenation is very low at 499 K (see Fig. 5). While the methanol yield in CO2 hydrogenation could limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium. So, the methanol synthesis rate are much lower for the individual CO and CO2 hydro- genation. When CO2 is added into CO/HE mixture, the methanol formation rate is 118 Y.

Water produced is consumed by the fast water-gas shift reaction (3), simultaneously providing CO2 which is the feed gas for methanol synthesis from reaction (2). As a result, the limitation of thermo- dynamic equilibrium for reaction (2) is removed, which leads to a higher methanol ~1 40 .

It is also found from Fig. 5 that the optimum reaction temperature for CO/CO2 hydrogenation is about 499 K which is consistent with CO2+H2. This result further demonstrated that the reaction (2) is a rate determining step and methanol is formed from CO2 hydrogenation. The stability for CZA01 catalyst shown in Fig. 8 reveals that the catalyst exhibits a higher catalytic activity, as well as an optimistic stability. As a possible explanation, since the copper species are isolated and highly dispersed, the sintering of copper particle is prohibited under the corresponding reaction con- dition. 4. Conclusions Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalysts derived from oxalate gel coprecipitation method show stable and high activities for methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation. The post-treatment for the precipitate has a remarkable effect on the structure and the catalytic activity for methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation. Washing with deionised water leads to a larger metallic particle size, smaller surface area (and metallic copper area) and weaker synergistic interaction between copper and ZnO. As a result, the catalytic activity decreases dramatically. It has been experimentally shown that methanol is formed from CO2 hydrogenation.
