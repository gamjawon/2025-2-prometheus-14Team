Introduction The anchoring of homogeneous metal com- plexes into various supports often leads to unex- pected alterations in the catalytic activities, which are due to changes in the microenviron- ment of the metal ions, to diffusional limita- tions, and to the changes in the rigidity of modifying groups. That is why the concept of attaching metal complexes to soluble polymers has recently become the focus of much attention [1]. These exciting new catalytic systems allow to perform various organic reactions due to unique features of conformational non-rigidity * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All SSDI 1381-1169(95)00212-X of macroligands which makes them in a certain sense similar to natural catalysts. We investigated a new type of water-soluble catalysts combining the properties of metal complexes and surfactants prepared from transi- tion metal complexes and terminally functional- ized polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of various molecular weights and block-copolymers of eth- ylene oxide and propylene oxide with different combinations of ethylene oxide (E) and propy- lene oxide (P) fragments (REP and RPE, R=CH3, C4H9). The properties of functional- ized RE, RPE and REP offer the possibility of designing soluble and potentially recoverable catalysts for various reactions. The PEGs and their derivatives are easily precipitated in a number of solvents (acetonitrile, benzene, meth- rights reserved 236 E.A. Karakhanov et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 235-240 ylene chloride, etc.) by addition of diethyl ether. The catalyst can be located in the aqueous phase, and the substrates and products in the organic phase. The use of such type of ligands [2](a,b) pos- sessing conformational sensitivity to the reac- tion conditions (solvent, temperature, pH, etc.) enables to influence the catalytic properties. Bergbreiter et al. recently described the use of oligomers of triblock copolymers of ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-ethylene oxide which are terminally functionalized by phosphine groups as ligands for the synthesis of rhodium hydrogenation catalysts, which possess the abil- ity to regulate reaction temperature by a re- versible temperature dependent phase separation [21(c). We used PEG functionalized by phosphine groups as a ligand to prepare a water-soluble Rh catalyst for the hydroformylation of alkenes. The development of a new water-soluble hydro- formylation catalyst active under moderate pres- sure and temperature is considered to be an important goal [3]. The sulphonated triph- enylphosphine-rhodium hydroformylation cata- lyst was patented by Rhone Poulenc [4] and technically realized by Ruhrchemie. On the basis of polymers, functionalized by dipyridyl and acetylacetonate, the complexes of iron and cobalt were obtained. These complexes were examined as catalysts for the oxidation of cyclohexane and ethylbenzene by both hydro- gen peroxide and oxygen. This choice seems to be interesting also from the point of view of developing of new biomimetic catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and measurements We used PEG of a molecular weight of 1550, monobutyl ether of PEG of a molecular weight of 5000 and monomethyl ethers of PE (REP, RPE) of a molecular weight of 3000. Ethers were synthesized by anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide [5]. 1H and 3~p NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VXR-400 spectrometer. Products were analyzed by GC on a Chrom-5 gas chromatograph and by HPLC on Gilson-310 and further characterized by GC-MS using a Finnigan-MAT-1125 GC- MS system. 2.2. Preparation of macroligands and com- plexes The tosylates were obtained according to a literature procedure [6]. For the synthesis of acetylacetonate derivatives (PEG-acac, RE- acac, REP-acac, RPE-acac) 6.2 mmole of acetyl acetone was dissolved in 10 ml of dry acetone and a solution of 6 mmole of sodium ethylate and 3.1 mmole of tosylate in 25 ml of acetone were added. The mixture was refluxed for 48 h. The acetone was distilled off, the residue was dissolved in dry methylene chloride and precipitated by dry diethyl ether (repeated three times). The yield was 90%. NMR: CH3(acac), 2.2 ppm; CH2-CH2-O(PEG), 3.61 ppm; CH3(Bu), 1.1 ppm; CH2, 1.4 ppm. NMR analysis indi- cated 90% substitution for PEG, RPE and 70% for REP. The synthesis of polymers modified by dipyridyl groups (PEG-dipy, REP-dipy) was performed in the following way: 5.25 mmole of triethylamine was added to a solution of 1.5 mmole of polymer in 50 ml of methylene chlo- ride at room temperature, thereafter a solution of 1.6 mmole of chloroanhydride of 2,2'-di- pyridyl-3,3'-dicarboxylic acid in 15 ml of meth- ylene chloride was added. The mixture was stirred for 6 h, filtered, and the product was precipitated by dry diethyl ether on cooling. The modified polymer was purified by double pre- cipitation from methylene chloride. NMR spec- tra: C-H(dipy), 8.65, 8.96 ppm; CH2-CH2- O(PEG), 3.61 ppm; CH3(Bu), 1.1 ppm. The degree of modification in case of REP was 80% and in case of PEG not more then 20%. The synthesis of complexes with cobalt E.A. Karakhanov et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 235-240 237 (RE-acac-Co3+) was performed as follows: equimolar amounts of 0.4 N KOH was added to 10 ml of stirred aqueous 0.1 N Co(NO3)2 solu- tion. On appearance of the precipitate of Co(OH)2 simultaneously with adding of the al- kali a double excess of the aqueous solution of the polymer, modified by acetylacetonate groups, was added. The mixture was stirred for 48 h. Then the water was removed by distilla- tion, the residue was dissolved in dry methylene chloride, filtered and precipitated by dry diethyl ether. The yield was 65%. The Co content was estimated by emission spectroscopic analyses, and found to be 0.2%. The synthesis of terminally functionalized PEG by phenylphosphine was performed in in- ert atmosphere according to [6]. The structure of the ligand obtained was proved by the ~H and 31p NMR. The amount of terminal groups was determined on the basis of I H NMR (0.5 mmole/g). The uptake of oxygen was measured with a gas buret. The complexes of polymers with iron were not isolated, but were introduced into the reaction mixture as water solutions, obtained by dissolving equimolar amounts of FeC13 and modified polymer. Hydroformylation was performed in a steel autoclave. Rh-acac(CO)2, the required amount of polymer and 2 ml of anhydrous toluene were inserted in autoclave. After careful cooling in liquid nitrogen the autoclave was degassed and then filled by 1 atm CO + H2 (1:1). The solu- tion was stirred at room temperature and atmo- spheric pressure for 3 h, and 1.5 ml of water, 1.5 mmole of dodecene-1 and 5 (10 or 15) atm/ CO + H2 were added. Under mechanical stir- ring a temperature of 50 was maintained for 6 h. The water phase with the catalyst was sepa- rated and was re-used. The organic phase was dried and analyzed. 2.3.

The maximum rate of the reaction was achieved in the solvent acetonitrile/water (1/3.5). The major product of the reaction was cyclohexanol, while the yields of cyclohex- anone were less than 5%. It is worth mentioning that under the reaction conditions used cyclohexanol was not oxidized, which testifies the fact that the route of products formation is different -- cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol are independently formed in paral- lel reaction paths. It follows from the results shown in Fig. 1 that macrocomplexes exhibit significantly higher activity than systems consisting of mixtures of polymer and iron salt. This fact can be ex- plained as follows: the oxidation of cyclohexane is likely to proceed via radical mechanisms in polymer micelles. In the complexes metal ions are coordinated both to terminal ligands and to oxygen atoms in the chain of PEG. The latter has a significant lability and are not bound strongly to iron,. The micelles formed can be regarded as microreactors in which the reaction proceeds. Free Fe(III) can easily be hydrolyzed and poorly absorbed by the polymer globules. The macromolecular structure of the catalysts hinders thehydrolysis of Fe(III) ions. At the same time iron coordinated to terminal groups of the ligand penetrates more easily to the inside of micelles where the concentration of cyclo- hexane is high. The oxidation of cyclohexane at different temperatures proves that the reaction proceeds inside the micelles. Extremes in yields of products were noticed at certain temperatures for every type of macrocomplexes. Apparently, this fact points to the change of conformation of polymers during the formation of micelles under alteration of the temperature. Micelles of block copolymers RPE and REP differ in the location of the modified groups. The hydrophilic part of the micelles consists of ethylene oxide blocks and nuclei of the micelles -- blocks of propylene oxide. The fixed metal ions in REP are located in the center of the micelle, meanwhile in case of RPE they are on the surface. Consequently, it is necessary to overcome the conformational and steric hin- drances to facilitate the reaction in the second case. The decrease of the yield of the product with further increase of temperature is connected with the decrease of the affinity of the polymer chains to the solvent and the formation of big con- glomerates. There is an optimal ratio of [H202]/[Fe(III)]. Increasing this ratio the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide increases and becomes predominant when the ratio gets higher than 225. 3.2. Oxidation of ethylbenzene The macrocomplexes obtained showed high activity and selectivity in the oxidation of ethyl- benzene by hydrogen peroxide.

The main prod- uct is acetophenone, the minor is methylphenyl- carbynol. As in the case of cyclohexane macro- complexes were more active than the catalytic systems consisting of mixture of FeCI3, acety- lacetone, and PEG in equimolecular amounts. With rising temperature the yields of prod- ucts grow and reach 73% in 2 h (Table 2). The results can be explained by increasing the affin- ity of ethylbenzene to PEG with rise of tempera- ture. Macrocomplexes PEG-acac-Co exhibited significant activity in the oxidation of ethylben- zene by dioxygen. From the data shown in Table 4 it is obvious that under the same tem- perature and even at smaller concentrations of cobalt macrocomplexes turned out to be more active than their non-polymeric analogues. The only product was acetophenone. The rise of oxygen and catalyst concentration resulted in the increase of reaction rates. The reaction is likely to go through the activation of dioxygen by the cobalt macrocomplex.

Hydroformylation The hydroformylation catalyst was obtained in situ from Rh-acac(CO)2 and the functional- ized polymer (RE)2-PPh under the atmosphere of the synthesis gas.

The rise of the pressure of the synthesis gas caused the increase of total yield of aldehyde. Using catalysts with different P/Rh ratio for hydroformylation showed that the optimum is around 15:1. It was shown that at the end of the reaction the catalyst practically completely re- mains in the water phase and can be easily separated from the products. The catalyst proved to be active in the hydroformylation of a new portion of dodecene. References [1] E.A. Karakhanov, E.B. Neimerovets and A.G. Dedov, Appl. Organomet. Chem., 4 (1990) 1.
