Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /Substrate Monolithic Catalyst for Toluene Catalytic Combustion ZHANG Qingbao, ZHAO Leihong*, TENG Botao, XIE Yunlong, YUE Lei Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Reactive Chemistry on Solid Surfaces, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, China Abstract: A novel Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 washcoat has been prepared by an impregnation method and used as a host for the active Pd component to prepare a Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst for toluene catalytic combustion. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, N 2 adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, and CO tempera- ture-programmed reduction have been used to characterize the catalyst. The washcoat is uniform and shows strong adhesion to the substrate according to an ultrasonic test. A toluene conversion of 97% is obtained at a temperature as low as 210 °C over the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst calcined at 400 °C. The formation of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution and the presence of the stable PdO phase at high tem- peratures are primarily responsible for the good thermal stability of the monolithic catalyst. Key words: monolithic catalyst; toluene; catalytic combustion; washcoat; palladium; ceria; zirconia Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced in industrial processes are major air pollutants causing a series of serious environmental problems. The increasingly stringent environ- mental regulations have prompted the development of tech- nologies to eliminate VOCs. Catalytic combustion has been recognized as one of the most effective technologies to destroy VOCs at low temperature because of its advantages such as high energy efficiency, low ignition temperature, and envi- ronmentally friendly. On the other hand, monolithic catalysts have been widely used in practical environmental applications [1]. These catalysts usually consist of a monolithic substrate, a washcoat, and noble metals as active components. The most common material as the monolithic substrate is cordierite monolith, which exhibits a low pressure drop, a low thermal expansion coefficient, a high mechanical strength, and a high thermal shock resistance [1,2]. The washcoat usually has a high surface area to better disperse the noble metals. The most commonly used washcoat material is -alumina. However, -alumina is not very stable and transforms into . -alumina at high temperatures [3,4]. To improve its stability, promoters such as CeO 2 , La 2 O 3 , and BaO [4–6] have been frequently used to inhibit the phase transformation and enhance the catalytic activity. However, the formation of CeAlO 3 from CeO 2 , LaAlO 3 from La 2 O 3 , and BaAl 12 O 9 (or BaAl 2 O 4 ) from BaO occurs, resulting in the destruction of active species when calcined at high temperatures. Another disadvantage of the -alumina washcoat is the different thermal dilation coefficient, leading to the formation of deep creeps [7]. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to the development of new washcoat materials such as carbon, zeolite, La 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , TiO 2 , and Y 2 O 3 [1,8–12]. Noble metals loaded on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides have been widely investigated as washcoat materials owing to their ex- cellent oxygen storage capacity, high thermal stability, and enhanced redox and catalytic properties [13–18]. Therefore, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides are regarded as a potentially practical material used as the support or main component of the wash- coat in third-generation three-way catalysts (TWCs) [19,20]. On the other hand, supported palladium catalysts have indus- trial potentials in the total combustion of hydrocarbons because of their lower price as compared with other noble metals in the market, excellent oxidation activity [21], and high temperature durability [22]. However, there are few reports using CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides as the washcoat material. This prompts us to carry out an extensive and systematic investiga- tion on this topic. ZHANG Qingbao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(4): 373–378 Recently, Tidahy et al. [23] prepared Pd/ZrO 2 , Pd/TiO 2 , and Pd/ZrO 2 -TiO 2 catalysts in the form of pellets for toluene and chlorobenzene combustion using hierarchical bimodal macro-mesoporous ZrO 2 , TiO 2 , and ZrO 2 -TiO 2 as supports, respectively. Moreover, Guo et al. [24] prepared Pd-only three-way catalysts with a washcoat consisting of Al 2 O 3 , CeO 2 -ZrO 2 , and/or La 2 O 3 using boehmite, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide powders prepared by the oxidation-coprecipitation method, and/or La(NO 3 ) 3 as the precursors, respectively. The active Pd component is introduced in the washcoat using a classical post-impregnation method. In this study, a Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst composed of the monolithic substrate, the washcoat, and the active component was prepared by combining the advantages of the cordierite monolith, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides, and Pd. The novel Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 washcoat on the cordierite monolith was developed by simultaneously washcoating the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides and Pd on the cordierite monolith using soluble precursors. It was found that the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 washcoat and Pd can anchor well onto the monolithic substrate, and the wash- coat shows high cohesive stability. Besides, the catalytic ac- tivity and thermal stability of the monolithic catalysts for toluene combustion were investigated. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation A commercial cordierite monolith (2MgO·2Al 2 O 3 ·5SiO 2 , in a cubic form of 48 mm × 24 mm × 40 mm) was used as the substrate. It had square channels, a cell density of 200 cpsi (cells per square inch), and a wall thickness of approximately 0.33 mm. The monolithic catalysts were prepared as follows. A mix- ture of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 ·5H 2 O with a Ce:Zr molar ratio of 4:1 was dissolved in distilled water. The citric acid monohydrate was used as the complexing agent in 1.5:1 molar ratio with respect to the sum of metal ions. The solution was constantly stirred at 80 °C in a water bath. An appropriate amount of 95% ethanol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with an average molecular weight of 10000 were added as the dis- persant and binder, respectively. Then an appropriate amount of aqueous solution of H 2 PdCl 4 was added to obtain a catalyst with the Pd mass percentage of 0.1%. The washcoating was carried out by dipping the cordierite monolith in the solution. The washcoated monolith was taken out and blown with air to remove the excessive solution. It was dried for 12 h in air at room temperature and then at 130 °C for 4 h in an oven fol- lowed by calcination at 400 °C for 1 h under static air in a muffle furnace. The dipping and drying procedures were re- peated, and then the catalysts were calcined at different tem- peratures (400–900 °C) for 2 h. The nominal loading of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides was 6 wt%. The obtained monolithic catalyst was designed as Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate. For com- parison, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxides-washcoated cordierite monolith, indicated as support material hereinafter, was pre- pared similarly except that the aqueous solution of H 2 PdCl 4 was not added. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) experiments of the dried sample were carried out using a Netzsch STA 449C instrument. Approximately 10 mg sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an air stream of 30 ml/min. The sample morphology was examined with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at an accelerated voltage of 15 kV. The samples were glued to the sample holder with silver paint and sputtered with gold to make them more conductive. The ultrasonic test was performed to evaluate the cohesive ability of the washcoat. The samples were subjected to ultrasound by immersing them in water inside a glass vessel and in an ultrasonic bath (KU-200 ultra- sonic vibration cleaner, 40 kHz, 220 W) for 30 min. After that, the samples were dried at 130 °C for 4 h in an oven. The weight of the samples before and after the ultrasonic treatment was measured, and the weight loss was calculated. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips PW3040/60 powder diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using nickel-filtered Cu K . ( = 0.1542 nm) radia- tion. The intensity data were collected at room temperature in a 2 range of 20°–60° at a scan rate of 9.6°/min. Nitrogen ad- sorption isotherms of the samples were obtained at 196 °C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 apparatus. The specific surface area was determined using the linear portion of the Brunauner-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microscope. The 514.5 nm line of an argon ion laser was used, and the laser power at the sample was set at 3 mW. The scanning range was 100–900 cm 1 . The reduction properties of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with CO as the reducing agent. The experiments were carried out in a quartz microreactor, and about 100 mg sample was used in each measurement. After introducing 5% CO/Ar at a total flow rate of 20 ml/min, the samples were heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The amount of CO 2 evolved during the reduction was monitored by a Balzers Omnistar 200 mass spectrometer at m/e = 44. 1.3 Catalytic activity test The as-prepared Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic cata- lyst was cut into two cylinders (i.d. 21 mm u 40 mm) for the catalytic activity test. Catalytic combustion of toluene over the ZHANG Qingbao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(4): 373–378 Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate catalyst was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with (i.d. 22 mm u 600 mm). The reactor was placed in an electric furnace, and the temperature was controlled by a programmed temperature controller. At the same time, both temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the monolithic catalysts were monitored. The reaction was performed at temperatures ranging from 200 to 350 °C, always from high to low tem- perature. The toluene concentration in air was 4000 mg/m 3 and the total flow rate was 0.3 m 3 /h corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10800 h 1 . The concentration of toluene was analyzed on a Shimadzu GC-14C gas chromato- graph equipped with an FID detector. In typical runs, the reac- tion data were obtained after the catalytic combustion of toluene was performed for more than 30 min to achieve the steady state. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 TG-DSC characterization To determine the optimum calcination temperature, the dried Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst was characterized by TG-DSC in air. As seen in Fig. 1, the weight loss occurs in one distinct region between 165 and 305 °C, which corre- sponds to about 5% weight loss of the dried sample. In addi- tion, a strong exothermic peak centered at 265 °C is also ob- served in this region. The weight loss may be primarily as- cribed to the decomposition of carbon species. This indicates that calcination at 400 °C in air is sufficient to remove the carbon species in the dried sample. Therefore, this temperature is chosen for all heat treatment. 2.2 Morphological characterization The morphology of the bare substrate and the Pd/ Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst calcined at 400 °C is shown in Fig. 2. Compared with the bare substrate (Fig. 2(a)), one sees that the washcoat (Fig. 2(b)) does not accumulate in thick layers at the corner of the cordierite monolithic wall. This observation is consistent with the earlier report [1]. As a result, the interaction between the washcoat and the substrate may be Fig. 1. TG-DSC curves of the dried Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate mono- lithic catalyst. Fig. 2.

ZHANG Qingbao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(4): 373–378 quite strong, and the washcoat may tightly anchor onto the substrate, which will be further validated by an ultrasonic test. In addition, Fig. 2(d) shows that the uniform and densely packed particles are deposited onto the surface of the substrate, implying that the washcoat is well distributed on the substrate. The homogeneous washcoat is very favorable for the disper- sion of the active phase and the improvement of the catalytic activity. For further verification, an ultrasonic test, which is usually used as a severe method of adhering testing, was performed. The weight losses of the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate catalysts calcined at 400 and 900 °C are 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively, which are considerably lower than that of the Al 2 O 3 washcoat (11.3%) [25], indicating that the washcoat shows strong adhe- sion to the substrate. 2.3 XRD and Raman characterization Fig. 3 illustrates the XRD patterns of the substrate, the support material, and the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts calcined at different temperatures. Compared with the substrate, no peaks corresponding to CeO 2 and ZrO 2 are ob- served for the support material and the monolithic catalysts calcined at 400–800 °C. However, the diffraction peaks at 2 = 28.5°, 33.0°, 47.5°, and 56.7° corresponding to the reflections of cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 are observed when the cal- cination temperature increases up to 900 °C. Meanwhile, no peaks of ZrO 2 phase are observed, indicating that ZrO 2 is in- corporated into the CeO 2 lattice to form a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution while maintaining the fluorite structure at a calcination temperature of 900 °C. In fact, the formation of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution has been frequently reported in the literature [26–28]. In addition, the appearance of CeO 2 diffraction peaks as the calcination temperature increases is mainly attributed to the sintering of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 particles. This will be further con- firmed by the BET surface areas of the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /sub- strate monolithic catalysts calcined at different temperatures. The surface area of the substrate is only 0.5 m 2 /g, whereas that of the support material is 5.9 m 2 /g. The surface areas of the monolithic catalysts are 4.4, 4.3, 2.6, 1.2, and 0.9 m 2 /g at cal- cination temperatures of 400, 500, 600, 800, and 900 °C, re- spectively. As anticipated, the surface areas of the monolithic catalysts decrease from 4.4 to 0.9 m 2 /g with increasing calci- nation temperature, indicating that CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide particles are sintered at higher temperatures. The laser Raman spectra of the substrate, support material, and Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. A peak centered at about 465 cm 1 is observed for the support material and the monolithic catalysts, which is typical of the F 2g Raman active mode of the cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 [29]. The intensity of the CeO 2 peak sharpens as the calcination temperature in- creases up to 900 °C, indicating that the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide particles are sintered, in agreement with the XRD and BET surface area results. No evidence of pure ZrO 2 absorption peaks is found in the corresponding laser Raman spectra, which Fig. 3. XRD patterns of the substrate, the support material, and the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts calcined at different temperatures. Fig. 4. Laser Raman spectra of the substrate, the support material, and the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts calcined at different temperatures. ZHANG Qingbao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(4): 373–378 indicates the formation of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution. Fur- thermore, the peak centered at 650 cm 1 is observed for the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts, which is as- signed to the Raman active B 1g vibrational mode of PdO [30]. With the calcination temperature increasing to 900 °C, the Raman peak of PdO becomes stronger and sharper, implying that the average crystallite size of PdO increases. 2.4 CO-TPR characterization Compared with H 2 , CO-TPR is one of the best probes to study the reducibility of both PdO and the support and is helpful in identifying the finely dispersed PdO, as well as to understand the redox behavior of the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5, no obvious reduction peak is observed for the substrate, while a main reduction peak around 520 °C related to the reduction of surface oxygen is observed for the support material. Three reduction peaks at about 110 °C ( . ), 220 °C ( ), and 520 °C ( ) are observed for the monolithic catalysts calcined at 400–600 °C, which corre- spond to the reduction of the finely dispersed PdO, large PdO particles [31], and surface oxygen [32], respectively. When the calcination temperature is above 600 °C, the . peak vanishes, while the peak shifts to a higher temperature, indicating that the finely dispersed PdO and large PdO particles are sintered. This result completely coincides with the analysis in the laser Raman experiment. At the same time, the peak disappears, while a new peak around 800 °C ( G) associated with the re- duction of the bulk oxygen [32] appears and shifts to a higher temperature. This is an indication that CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide particles are sintered, which is consistent with the XRD, BET surface area, and laser Raman results. 2.5 Catalytic combustion of toluene over the monolithic catalysts Catalytic combustion of toluene over the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 / substrate monolithic catalysts calcined at different tempera- tures is shown in Fig. 6. Carbon dioxide and water are observed as the reaction products, indicating that complete combustion occurs in the reaction. As shown in Fig. 6, the catalyst calcined at 400 °C exhibits the highest activity for toluene combustion. Toluene conversion of 97% is achieved at a temperature as low as 210 °C. Moreover, the dependence of toluene conversion on the reaction temperature is obviously related to the calcination temperature. The catalytic activities of the Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 / substrate catalysts calcined at different temperatures decrease with increasing calcination temperature. This may be attributed to the sintering of the PdO particles and CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide particles and the decreasing surface area as shown in the XRD, BET surface area, Raman, and CO-TPR results. On the other hand, the lowest temperature for toluene conversion of 97% is increased by 60 °C for the monolithic catalyst calcined at 900 °C compared with the monolithic catalyst calcined at 400 °C. This indicates that the monolithic catalyst has a good thermal stability. As reported in the literature [33,34], CeO 2 can act as an oxygen storage reservoir giving lattice oxygen to Pd, which can stabilize Pd in an oxidized form at high tempera- tures. Besides, it is well known that CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution shows a high mobility of lattice oxygen in comparison with pure CeO 2 [13–15]. Therefore, the good thermal stability may be associated with the formation of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution and the presence of the stable PdO phase at high temperatures. 3 Conclusions The Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst with a novel washcoat Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was prepared. This washcoat is uniform and shows strong adhesion to the substrate. The Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst calcined at 400 °C Fig. 5.

ZHANG Qingbao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(4): 373–378 exhibits the highest catalytic activity, over which the toluene conversion is up to 97% at a temperature as low as 210 °C. The Pd/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 /substrate monolithic catalyst has a good ther- mal stability in the toluene combustion test, which is mainly attributed to the formation of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution and the presence of the stable PdO phase at high temperatures.

RESEARCH PAPER Pd/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2/Substrate Monolithic Catalyst for Toluene Catalytic Combustion ZHANG Qingbao ZHAO Leihong * TENG Botao XIE Yunlong YUE Lei Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Reactive Chemistry on Solid Surfaces, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-579-82298907 A novel Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 washcoat has been prepared by an impregnation method and used as a host for the active Pd component to prepare a Pd/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2/substrate monolithic catalyst for toluene catalytic combustion. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, and CO temperature-programmed reduction have been used to characterize the catalyst. The washcoat is uniform and shows strong adhesion to the substrate according to an ultrasonic test. A toluene conversion of 97% is obtained at a temperature as low as 210 °C over the Pd/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2/substrate monolithic catalyst calcined at 400 °C. The formation of CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution and the presence of the stable PdO phase at high temperatures are primarily responsible for the good thermal stability of the monolithic catalyst.
