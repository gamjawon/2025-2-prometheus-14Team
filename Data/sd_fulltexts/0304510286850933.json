Substitution of the pyridine ligands in Mo(NO)2(pyridine)2Cl;j with the polymer-bound ligands has been found to give the most stable catalyst. The co-catalyst EtAlCl2 has been found to interact with the polar func- tional groups on the polymer, causing a relatively high consumption of co- catalyst. The reaction of the polar groups with EtAlCl2 has been mimicked in a separate study, in which Mo(NO)2(PPh3)2Cl2 was used as the catalyst and with methyl stearate added to the reaction medium. For the polymer-bound catalyst, the activity and the stereoselectivity at 0% conversion have been found to be almost identical to those observed for homogeneous analogues. Introduction The method of metal complex immobilization on a solid support, e.g. polystyrene, is today a well-established technique [1, 2]. Applied to the type of catalyst systems used in the olefin metathesis reaction, two different ap- proaches have emerged, viz. immobilization of the catalyst precursor (A) and immobilization of the co-catalyst (B). Reported examples of method A have used phosphine [3] or bipyridine ligand [4] bound to the support. These ligands were then in turn used to covalently bind a transition metal complex e.g. M(CO)6-xL.K (M = Mo, W; L = polymer-bound ligand). Addition of co- catalyst then gave an active catalyst. By the use of method B, the catalyst precursor is linked to the support via reaction with the polymer-bound co- catalyst and simultaneously activated. Reported examples of this method include WC4 and as the polymer-bound co-catalyst either EtAlCl; [5] or * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 376 SnMe4 [6]. Method A is restricted to complexes bearing ligands that can eas- ily be linked to a support. This means that complexes like WClg coordinated solely to chloro ligands cannot be immobilized via this route. In addition, in order to prevent severe metal-leaching from the support, the bond between the metal and the supported ligand must be chemically stable under the cat- alytic cycle. One metal complex highly active as catalyst for metathesis of olefins and which can meet the two requirements mentioned is the M(NO)2L2C4 (M = Mo, W) type of complexes. These complexes were originally introduced as metathesis catalysts by Zuech et al. [7] and further explored by Hughes [9]. The ligands denoted L in the formula can be phosphines, phosphites or amines, i.e. ligands that with traditional methods can be bound to a support. Moreover, earlier reports [8, 9] indicate that the Mo L linkage is stable under catalyst generation (treatment with co-catalyst) as well as under the catalytic cycle. However, whether the active specie is ligated by or free from the ligand L is a matter of controversy, since in a recent investigation Seyferth and Taube [10] formulated an active intermediate as a MoCl(NO) fragment free from the ligand L. Immobilization of Mo(NO)2Li2Cl2 on phosphinated polystyrene has been described by Grubbs et al. [6]. They found that, after activation with Me^lada, this catalyst gave nearly the same activity as the non-supported complex. No information on metal leakage was, however, reported in that study. In the present study we report results on the metathesis of olefins with MotNC^LjCl^ supported on a different type of polymer gel, viz. a copoly- mer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate (Fig. 1). To our knowledge this is the first study in which a highly polar organic polymer is used as a support for homogeneous metathesis catalysts. Since it is well known that the presence of Lewis bases inhibits or diminishes the activity for most metathesis catalyst systems, our results with this polar carrier can CH3 CH3 CHg -CHa-C- CH; - C - CH; - C - CHz- CO CO CO 0, 0 0 ^u / / CHz CM^CHaOH CH^CHaOH CMz 0' CO I \"~ dig * C*\"* CHg \"'*\" CHa Fig. 1.

Experimental Materials Z-2-pentene was purchased from Fluka and stored as received over ac- tivated molecular sieves. Analytical grade chlorobenzene was dried over CaHz and distilled under nitrogen before use. EtAlCl; (Alfa Ventron) was used as received and diluted to the desired concentration with dry oxygen- free chlorobenzene under nitrogen. The polymer Spheron 1000 was pur- chased from Lachema, Czechoslovakia. Before use, the polymer was washed with acetone, methanol, dichloromethane and finally dried in vacuo. Mo (N0)2012 and Mo(NO)2L2Cl2 (L = pyridine, triphenylphosphine, benzonitrile, diphenylbutoxyphosphine) were prepared according to the procedures de- scribed by Cotton and Johnson [11]. All syntheses and manipulations were carried out under dry oxygen-free nitrogen. Infrared spectra IR spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 580B IR spectrometer equipped with a PE data station. The polymers were examined as KBr or polyethylene pellets. IR determination of the complex formation between EtAlCl2 and methyl stearate was done as described earlier by Kemula and Iwamoto [16]. Ana/yses C, H and N elementary analyses were carried out at the Microanalytical Laboratory, University of Lund. Molybdenum was determined by AAS. The analytical determinations of phosphorus [12] and the number of hydroxyl groups [13] followed literature procedures. The reaction mixtures from the olefin metathesis experiments were analysed on a Perkin Elmer F17 GC equipped with a computing integrator (LCI-100). Two different columns were used, viz. 10% TCEP on Chromosorb P and Durapak n-octane/Poracil C. The different products obtained were identified by mass spectrometry and by comparison of their retention times with that of authentic samples. Preparation of polymer-bound catalysts The polymer was phosphitated by the method described by Lieto et al. [I], viz. esterfication of chlorodiphenylphosphine with the hydroxyethyl groups on the polymer in the presence of pyridine as the base. By this method, a polymer containing 2.3% phosphorus was prepared. The catalyst precursor Mo(NO)2L2Cl2 was immobilized by the two fol- lowing routes: 378 Route 1: ligand exchange The phosphitated polymer was equilibrated in boiling CH^Cl^ with an excess of Mo(NO)2L2Cl2 (L = pyridine or benzonitrile) for 4 - 5 h. The green- yellow polymer was filtered, Soxhiet extracted with CH^C\\^ for 16 h and finally dried in vacuo. Route 2: reaction with Mo(NO)^Cly 1.0 g phosphitated polymer was suspended in 50 ml of degassed CH^CIa and treated with 83 mg Mo(NO)2Cl2 for 18 h at room temperature. Filtra- tion, Soxhiet extraction and drying gave a yellow-green polymer. Analytical data for the prepared catalyst precursors are collected in Table 1.

Olefin metathesis experiments The catalytic experiments were conducted in a 25 ml two-necked glass vessel equipped with a silicon rubber septum and connected to a tubing sys- tem which allowed the introduction of co-catalyst or chlorobenzene from storage bottles and nitrogen or vacuum via the vacuum line. The glass vessel was dried in an oven at 130 C before use. After introduction of the desired amount of the polymer-bound catalyst precursor, the vessel was evacuated for 15 min and then filled with nitrogen. Thereafter, 10 ml of chloroben- zene was introduced followed by the desired amount of EtAlCl; in chloro- benzene. The olefin was then added and the pressure adjusted to 1 atm. A similar procedure was also used with the corresponding non-supported com- plexes, except that an induction period of 60 min was used in this case. Sampling was done with a hypodermic syringe via the membrane. The polymer-bound catalyst was separated by centrifuging the samples. For the case of the homogeneous catalysts, the reaction was terminated by addition of ethanol to the samples. 379 Initial rates expressed as mole substrate converted per minute and mole catalyst were calculated from the initial slopes of the conversion versus time curves. Results and discussion Catalyst preparation and characterisation The synthesis of the polymer-bound molybdenum complexes starts with the introduction of the phosphorus donor ligand onto the polymer via reaction of the surface hydroxyl groups with chlorodiphenylphosphine (eqn. 1). ^-OH + CIPPh, -Baa \" ^-0-PPhg (1) A theoretical value of 10% phosphorus can be calculated using the number of hydroxyl groups on the polymer surface as determined by titration (see experimental). The highest figure we have reached, however, is 2.3% phos- phorus corresponding to 23% of the theoretical conversion. This shows that a large proprotion of the surface hydroxyl groups are not accessible for re- action with chlorodiphenylphosphine under the conditions used. Neverthe- less, under other conditions or together with other reagents, such surface hydroxyls are potentially reactive as discussed earlier [14]. In the esterfica- tion reaction there is also a possibility for a tertiary phosphine oxide to form on the surface by isomerisation [15]. The possibility of metal binding via hydroxyl and/or phosphine oxide groups must thus be taken into account in the preparation of the catalyst. These extra ligand sites and the complexes eventually formed from them will affect the catalyst behaviour and stability. With this in mind, we have investigated two different ways to prepare our catalyst precursors. Starting from the polymeric molybdenum-nitrosyi compound (eqn. 2) reactions with phosphines, phosphine oxide and alcohol [MotNO^Cis],, +2nL - nMotNOztzCIa (2) hydroxyl groups [11,17] have been observed. In the case of phosphines or phosphine oxides complexes of the Mo(NO)2l-i2Cl2 type are obtained, while the alcohol complexes are less well-defined with the general formula Mo- (NO)2Cl2(ROH)x [17]. Applying eqn. 2 to the synthesis of polymer-bound catalysts, at least three different complexes can consequently be expected to form on the polymer. In addition, part of the polymeric nature of the starting complex can stay intact if the ligand sites on the polymer are well separated. Under cat- alytic conditions these oligomers can split to form other complexes or even- tually cause metal leaching. In our opinion, the ligand substitution reaction (eqn. 3) is in this respect more attractive. In this case, the ligands on the 380 Mo(NO>21-2C12+ 2L 3==E Mo(NO);,L';,CI;> + 2L (3) polymer must compete with the exchanging ligand. The relative proportion of the different complexes formed on the polymeric resin will therefore be dependent on the relative amount of the different ligands and of their com- plexing ability compared to that of the leaving ligand. After reaction of the pyridine complex with the non-phosphitated polymer, the polymer was re- covered unchanged, while reaction with the benzonitrile complex resulted in substantial metal uptake, as noted by the color of the polymer. In the IR spectrum of this latter polymer, no sign of any coordinated benzonitrile was observed, but the spectrum showed two bands in the NO-stretching region, viz. 1795 cm\"1 and 1695 cm~1. These frequencies are in accordance with those observed for alcoholate complexes [17], e.g. the ethyleneglycol com- plex at 1792 cm\"1 and 1680 cnT1. It is therefore likely that the surface hydroxyl ligands will substitute the benzonitrile ligands, but not the pyridine ligands, in the reacting complex. Even reaction of the non-phosphitated polymer according to eqn. 2 resulted in a green polymer with the same IR frequencies in the NO-region. Obviously, reaction with the benzonitrile complex as well as the bridge-splitting reaction leads to the same type of sur- face compounds. However, reaction of the phosphitated polymer independent of the method used resulted in green-yellow polymers with NO-stretching frequen- cies at 1787 cm\"1 and 1668 cm\"!. These frequencies are lower than those observed for the non-phosphitated polymers, more in agreement with those observed for phosphine complexes [11]. From our spectra we cannot how- ever exclude the presence of small amounts alcoholate complexes, even on the phosphitated polymer. We have also studied the Mo Cl stretching frequencies of our prepara- tions. In all of them a band was present which can be assigned to a Mo Cl vibration. No significant differences in the position of this band (308 cm~1) for preparations A-D was found, but the intensity was markedly increased for preparations C and D compared to that of A and B. Two explanations are plausible, viz. the presence of oligomeric chloro-bridged complexes or a frans-chloro arrangement at Mo. Both explanations are equally possible, if literature data [11,18] on Mo Cl stretching frequencies and intensities are taken into account. On the basis of the stability of the different preparations under catalytic testing, vide supra, the oligomeric type of complexes are however the most likely ones. A complete mapping of the type of complexes and their relative amounts on the polymers is, however, a difficult task. Olefin metathesis studies The prepared polymer-bound complexes were tested with respect to activity for the metathesis of Z-2-pentene. As shown by Hughes [20], the type of complexes under discussion are activated by reaction with EtAlClz and maximum activity was, in that study, found at an Al/Mo ratio of 5 - 6. 381 Fig. 2. The initial rate R^ vs. the amount of EtAlCl^ (mmol (g polymer)\"1). Reaction conditions: 0.18 g catalyst, preparation A, olefin/Mo = 400, T = 23 C. We have also used the same co-catalyst, but found that a much larger amount of co-catalyst was needed to reach the highest activity. The activity was strongly dependent on the amount of co-catalyst added (Fig. 2), and max- imum activity was found at about 7 mmol EtAlCl; per gram of polymer. This number corresponds to an Al/Mo ratio of 36 (preparation D). This high value of the Al/Mo ratio is not mainly due to the activation of the molyb- denum complex, but is merely an effect of reactions of EtAlCl^ with the polymer carrier. In Fig. 1, two types of functional groups in the polymer which can react with EtAlCl; are recognized, viz. hydroxyl groups OH and carbonyl groups C=0. In addition, uncomplexed phosphite groups 0 PPh; are also present on the polymer, as shown by the Mo/P ratio (Table 1). As a result of these groups, three different EtAlCla-consuming reactions, shown in eqns. 4-6, are possible. (4) (5) (6) - CH^CHa-OH +EIAIC12 - -CH2CHa-OAlCl2+ Ethane -CHaCHz-OPPha+EtAICIzS^-CHaCHa-OPPhaAIEtCta ^C=0 tElAIOI,-^ ^CssO-AIEtCIa After reaction of the polymer with EtAlCl^ the formation of ethane was observed by GLC analysis, while the formation of ester carbonyl adducts (eqn. 6) was detected by IR spectroscopy in the carbonyl stretching region. 382 1800 1600 Fig. 3. IR spectrum of the phosphitated polymer after reaction with EtAlCl^ (7 mmol (g polymer)\"1). Upon reaction of the catalyst with EtAlClz, the original CO band of the polymer at 1728 cm\"1 was split into a doublet containing the original band and a new one at 1632 cm\"1 (Fig. 3). The shift observed of 96 cm\"1 resem- bles that observed earlier [19] for MeAlCla-ester adducts (AcnT1 = 98 -126) or the shift we have observed (vide supra) for EtAlCls-methyl stearate adduct (Acm\"1 = 126). Instead of using EtAlC^ to block the Lewis basic groups in the poly- mer, we have also used combinations of A1C13 and EtAlCl; in the activation procedure. A1C13 itself was not able to activate the catalyst. By the addition of A1C13 to the polymer (6 mmol (g polymer)\"!) before the addition of EtAlCl2, it was possible to reduce by 47% the amount of EtAlCl; needed to reach full activity. This support the idea that the main consumption of EtAl- Cl; is due to reaction with the Lewis basic groups on the polymer. As noted in the introductory paragraph, Lewis basic groups in the polymer could eventually interact and diminish the catalytic activity of the Mo catalyst. However, by blocking these sites via coordination or reaction with the co-catalyst, their ability to interact with the catalytic center is sub- stantially reduced, and thus catalytic activity will be maintained. Blocking of Lewis basic groups with a Lewis acidic co-catalyst could perhaps be used to tackle the problem of metathesis of functionalized olefins. We have in the present study made some efforts in that direction by investigating the meta- thesis of Z-2-pentene in the presence of methyl stearate using the homoge- neous Mo(NO)2(PPh3)2Cl2/EtAlCl2 catalyst. 383 Initially, we studied the complex formation between methyl stearate and EtAlCIa by IR measurements (r(CO) methyl stearate 1738 cm\"1 and adduct 1611 cm\"1). We then also examined the catalytic activity for Z-2- pentene metathesis as a function of the C^AICI /Cestei ratio (Fig. 4). One can note that the activity of the metathesis is low for conditions when the com- plex formation is low, i.e. there are large quantities of free ester that can poison the catalytic system. When the majority of the ester groups are bonded in a complex with the Lewis acid, however, the activity rises sharply. The curve in Fig. 4 shows striking similarities to that of the polymer-bound system in Fig. 2. In both cases a relatively large amount of EtAlCl, must be used to reach maximum activity, because of the Lewis bases present. Besides the consumption of co-catalyst, one other divergent behaviour of our polymer-bound catalyst was observed. This was a lack of pretreatment Pig. 4. n: the percentage complex-bound methyl stearate (%CMS) as a function of the C'EtAlCl^/C'Ester ratio as determined by IR spectroscopic studies in chlorobenzene solu- tion at 23 C; v: the initial rate (R^) for the metathesis of Z-2-pentene with Mo(NO)a- (PPh3)2d2 in the presence of methyl stearate us.

Hughes [20] found that a pretreatment period of 60 min gave the best initial activity for the homogeneous system. In our case, the activity as depicted in Fig. 5 was found to be equally as high on simultaneous addi- tion of catalyst, co-catalyst and olefin, as that observed for the analogous homogeneous complex MotNCOatPPhaOB^zClz after 60 min pretreatment. The results presented in Fig. 5 show that the two systems are equally active. With respect to the stereoselectivity at 0% conversion, using the method described by Bilhou et al. [21] to determine this quantity, the het- erogenized system is also very similar to the analogous homogeneous sys- tems. For our preparations (A-D) the E/Z 2-butene ratios fall in the range of 0.22 - 0.26 and thus in very close resemblance to the value of 0.20 - 0.24 for homogeneous systems [22]. Fig. 8.

However, for all of them nearly the same activities, ex- pressed as initial rate, were found. The stability of these heterogenized complexes, i.e. their tendency to leach metal, is of interest for two reasons. Firstly, if they are to be of any practical value, it is essential that they stay intact. At any reasonable concen- tration of EtAlCl; (up to 7 mmol EtAlCIa (g polymer)\"1) all the complexes (A-D) were stable as determined by AAS of the reactant solutions. At high concentrations (>7 mmol EtAlCIa (g polymer)\"1) some leaching was observ- ed for C and D. The reason for this is most likely the presence of halide- bridged complexes in these two preparations, of the type discussed in the previous section. Secondly, the question whether the Mgand L stays coordinated to the active species under the catalytic cycle is not yet solved. Since we have observed no metal leaching from our polymers under catalytic operation, this is indicative of an active intermediate with the ligand L coordinated to the metal, contrary to the active intermediate proposed by Seyferth and Taube [10]. The present study shows that highly polar polymers can be used as carriers for metal complexes active as metathesis catalysts, if a proper method of preparation is used. This study also presents one of the very few examples in which a successful immobilization has been carried out without altering the catalytic behaviour of the system, i.e. where the activity and selectivity are essentially maintained.

The metathesis of Z-2-pentene has been studied using Mo(NO)2L2Cl2 immobilized on a polar organic polymer, viz. a copolymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate, as the catalyst. Substitution of the pyridine ligands in Mo(NO)2(pyridine)2Cl2 with the polymer-bound ligands has been found to give the most stable catalyst. The co-catalyst EtAlCl2 has been found to interact with the polar functional groups on the polymer, causing a relatively high consumption of cocatalyst. The reaction of the polar groups with EtAlCl2 has been mimicked in a separate study, in which Mo(NO)2(PPh3)2Cl2 was used as the catalyst and with methyl stearate added to the reaction medium. For the polymer-bound catalyst, the activity and the stereoselectivity at 0% conversion have been found to be almost identical to those observed for homogeneous analogues. References 1 J. Lieto D.
