UV irradiation of the anchored catalyst at 275 K in the presence of COz and H20 led to the photocatalytic formation of CH,, CH30H and CO as major products. Based on the direct detection of the intermediate species such as 'C, 'H and Ti3+, a molecular scale reaction mechanism was discussed. Introduction With well-defined anchored catalysts, one can expect not only to achieve more active and selective photocatalytic systems, but also to obtain more detailed information about the mechanisms of photocatalysis on a molecular scale. Also, with the anchoring method one can design active surfaces that span the range from discrete molecules to extended semiconductor structures. Such structure changes are of special interest in connection with the particle size and/or size quantization effects on photocatalysis [ 11. On the other hand, reducing global air pollution caused by exhaust gases is currently an urgent and serious challenge [1, 21. In particular, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the most important problems in connection with the `greenhouse effect'. Photosynthetic reduction of carbon dioxide with Hz0 to produce CH4 and CH30H using highly active photocatalysts is of special interest and one of the most desirable objectives in this area [31. In this paper we report on photosynthetic reduction of C02 with H20 to produce CHQ and CH30H on highly dispersed titanium oxides anchored onto transparent porous Vycor glass. Experimental Anchoring was performed using a facile reaction of TiC14 with the surface OH groups of transparent porous Vycor glass (Corning code 7930, BET *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

Afterward, the samples were degassed at around 473 K, calcined in 02 at around 873 K, and finally degassed at 453-473 K before use. The concentration of titanium ions anchored onto the surface of Vycor glass that had been degassed at 773 K was determined to be about 3 x 10-5 mol g-1. UV irradiation was carried out using a 75 W high-pressure mercury lamp through water and color filters (.t > 280 nn) at 275 and 323 K. ESR spectra were recorded with a JES-RE-2X (X-band) spectrometer at 77 and 298 K. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu RF-501 spectrofluorophotometer with filters to eliminate scattered light at 77 and 298 K. Analysis of photoreaction products was accomplished by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The experimental details can be found in our previous papers [2, 4-7j. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows a typical photoluminescence spectrum of the titanium oxide anchored onto Vycor glass and its excitation spectrum (i.e., absorption spectrum) at 77 K. As reported in the previous papers [3-5], the absorption of light brings about an electron transfer from oxygen to titanium ion, resulting in the formation of pairs of a trapped hole center (O-) and an electron center (Ti3+). Thus the absorption and photoluminescence spectra are attributed to the charge-transfer processes on the anchored titanium oxide species on the support surface.

As shown in Fig. 1 (spectra 1-5), the addition of H20 or COZ molecules at 275 K onto the anchored titanium oxide leads to an efficient quenching of the photolurninescence with different efficiencies. Such an efficient quenching of the photoluminescence with COz or Hz0 suggests not only that the emitting sites are highly dispersed on the surfaces, but also that added COZ or H20 interacts and/or reacts with the anchored titanium oxide species in both its ground and excited states. As shown in Mg. 2, upon UV irradiation of the anchored titanium oxide catalyst in the presence of a mixture of COz and H20, the evolution of CH4 and CH30H into the gas phase takes place at 275 K with good linear relationships between the yields of these products and the UV irradiation time. The amounts of photo-formed CO and Oz have not yet been determined quantitatively, their evolution into the gas phase also being detected by GC and MS. The CO/CH4 yield ratio was found to increase when the UV irradiation was carried out at 323 K instead of at 275 K. As shown in Fig. 2 (curves a' and b'), in addition to the CHq and CH30H that evolved into the gas phase at 275 K under UV irradiation, additional CH4 and CH30H were formed as desorption products when the temperature of the catalyst was raised stepwise up to 673 K after the UV irradiation. The yields of these additionally formed CH4 and CH30H desorption products are found to be much larger than those of the CH4 and CH30H that were evolved into the gas phase under UV irradiation at 275 K.

Time profile of the photocatalytic evolution of (a) CHq and (b) CH30H at 275 K from COZ and Hz0 on the anchored titanium oxide catalyst under LTV irradiation at 275 K, and of the formation of (a') CHQ and (b') CH30H from the system when the temperature of the catalyst was raised to 673 K after LTV irradiation at 275 K. (After UV irradiation, the temperature was raised stepwise up to 673 K.) 210 is clear that the yields of these additionally formed CH4 and CH30H products also depend on the UV irradiation time for up to 4 h, and then decline gradually, especially after long UV irradiation times. Thus these results clearly indicate that CH4 and CH30H are produced from COZ and H20 on the anchored titanium oxide under UV irradiation at 275 K. Simultaneously, some parts of the reduced carbon intermediate species are trapped and remain on the surface as stable compounds at 275 K. Upon raising the temperature of the catalyst after UV irradiation, the majority of these stable compounds should desorb as CH4, with the formation of a small amount of CH30H. Figure 3 shows the effect of the H20/COZ ratio on the yields of the photocatalytic reaction of COZ and H20 on the anchored titanium oxide catalyst at 275 K. It is clear that in the presence of COZ alone, only a very small amount of CH4 is produced. In the presence of both COZ and H20, CH4, CZHs, C2H4 and CH30H are formed, their yields increasing with increasing H20 /COZ ratio of the reactants. These results clearly indicate that the presence of both COZ and HZO is indispensable in the photocatalytic reduction of COZ to produce CH4 and CH30H on the anchored titanium oxide at 275 K. In agreement with these results, it was found that CD4 was the major composition of the photo-formed methane molecules in the photocatalytic reaction systems- involving COZ and D20 in place of H20. - Thus this is the first report to find the photosynthetic reduction of C09 and the formation of CH4 and CH30H from COZ and H20 in the solid-gas phase photocatalytic systems. UV irradiation of the anchored titanium oxide catalyst in the presence Of COZ and H20 at 77 K led to the appearance of the ESR signals shown 20 ~- sn 60 2 0 ' Wig. 3. Effect of the H20/COZ ratio upon the yields of the photo-formed products in the photocatalytic reaction of COZ and HZO on the anchored titanium oxide catalyst at 275 K. The amount of COZ was constant at 4.56 x 10-6 mol g-'. 211 in Fig. 4. These ESR signals increased in intensity with LTV irradiation time at 77 K and were found to disappear once the temperature of the cell was raised to 275 K. In this system the formation of CH4 as a product was detected, though the amount was very small compared with that of the photoreaction. The signals consisted of three different radical species: 'C radicals with a symmetric shape and a g value of 2.003, H atoms with a doublet having about a 490 G splitting value, and Ti3+ ions with g1 -1.9678 and gi, -1.9218. The relative intensities of these ESR signals were found to depend strongly on the amounts of COz and HZO on the catalyst, the intensity of the H atoms signal increasing with increasing amount of H20, while the intensity of Ti3+ ions signal decreased. These results suggest that CH4 is formed by the reaction of 'C radicals formed from COz with H atoms that are formed by the reduction of protons (H+) supplied from H20 adsorbed on the catalyst. Judging from the absorption band at around 320 nm and the photoluminescence spectrum at around 470 nn of the anchored titanium oxide, the catalyst is expected to have much higher electronic reduction and oxidation potentials. As a result, the photoreduction of COz molecules into bare carbons (via the formation of CO) on the anchored titanium oxide is attributed to the highly excited electronic state of the catalyst, i.e., to the high reactivity of the charge-transfer excited state of (Ti3+-O-)3* species. Such high reactivity may be linked with the well-dispersed homogeneous titanium oxide species on the anchored catalyst, as suggested in our previous papers [3-5]. Major parts of the reduced bare carbons may be trapped and may remain stable in the form of graphitic carbons on the surface. These graphitic carbons H-atoms g=2.180 (A = 489 G) 1.9678 3+ ions g = 1.9218 Fig. 4. ESR spectra obtained in the photocatalytic reaction system involving COZ and HZO on the anchored titanium oxide catalyst at 77 K. LTV irradiation at 77 K for 1 h; the amount of COZ was 6.6X 10-5 mol g-'. H20 was adsorbed (6.6X 10-5 mol g-') and then evacuated at 290 K for 20 min. 212 easily decompose and react with the remaining H20 and/or the surface OH groups to produce CH4 (with formation of a minor amount of CH30H) when the temperature of the catalyst is raised stepwise up to 673 K after UV irradiation, as shown in Fig. 2 (curves a' and b'). Although the direct detection of 'OH radicals seems to be very difficult owing to their high reactivity, it is expected that CH30H may be formed by the reaction of 'OH radicals and the photo-formed 'CH3 radicals and/or CH4. The formation of CZHg and CZH4 as minor products should be produced by the reaction of the photo-formed 'CH3 radicals. Conclusions UV irradiation of the anchored titanium oxide catalyst in the presence of COZ and H20 at 275 K led to the formation of CH4, with a minor amount of CH30H. C2H4 and C2H8, CO and OZ were also produced. Thus the photocatalytic reduction of COZ with H20 is first performed on the active anchored titanium oxide catalyst at 275 K. UV irradiation of the catalyst at 77 K in the presence of COZ and HZO led to the formation of 'C radicals, H atoms and Ti` ions, their yields strongly dependent on the amounts of COZ and H20 on the catalyst. These results clearly indicate that CH4 is formed by the reaction of 'C radicals and H atoms. The formation of CH30H may be associated with the reaction of bare carbons with H atoms and 'OH radicals. Thus the photoreduction of COz with H20 should be linked to the much higher reactivity of the charge-transfer excited state, i.e., (Ti3+-O-)3*, owing to the presence of well-dispersed homogeneous titanium oxide species on the surface.
