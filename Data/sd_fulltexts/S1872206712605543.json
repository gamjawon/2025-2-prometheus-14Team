Keywords: Carbon dioxide Dry reforming Methane Nickel catalyst Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 zeolite Carbon deposition Â Â 1. Introduction Synthesis gas, usually called syngas (CO and H2), is industriâ€� ally useful for making various valueâ€�added liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates through the wellâ€�known Fischerâ€�Tropsch proâ€� cess [1,2]. Syngas can be produced through the following cataâ€� lytic processes: partial oxidation, steam reforming, and dry reforming of methane [3,4]. Dry reforming is attracting inâ€� creasing attention as it consumes two of the most important greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) to produce syngas [5â€“7]. The catalyst support plays an important role in coking resistance of metal particles and may even participate in the catalytic activiâ€� ty [8]. Zeolites are attractive supports for CO2 reforming of CH4 because they have wellâ€�defined structures, high surface areas, high thermal stabilities, and high affinities for CO2; these propâ€� erties are expected to enhance the catalyst selectivity and staâ€� bility [9,10]. It is also well known that zeolite supports have the potential to deliver very high metal dispersions and to provide stable systems. These excellent properties, combined with a low potential for supportâ€“metal interactions and superior cokâ€� ing resistance, make zeolites important catalyst supports in the CO2 reforming of CH4. Ni catalysts are used industrially for both steam reforming and dry reforming reactions because of their fast turnover rates, ready availability, and low costs [11]. A major problem encountered in Niâ€�based catalysts is carbon deposition on the surface, which leads to deactivation and blockage of reactor tubes. Besides coke formation, sintering of metal particles can also contribute to loss of catalytic activity [12,13]. Materials traditionally used as supports are insulating oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, V2O5, and TiO2, and various types of zeolites have also been tested [14,15]. Recently, the activities of different zeoliteâ€�supported Ni catalysts for CH4 reforming with CO2 have been investigated [4,16]. Among these, MFIâ€� and USYâ€�type zeoâ€� lites greatly improve the stability and selectivity of the reaction because they have suitable properties (e.g., microporous strucâ€� * Corresponding author.

FAKEEHA et al./Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 764â€“768 Â tures, high surface areas, and high affinities for CO2 adsorption) for catalyst supports in reforming reactions [17â€“19]. In this study, the stabilities and catalytic activities of three Ni catalysts, supported on alumina, Yâ€�zeolite, and Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 zeolite, were investigated. Various characterization techniques were used to quantify the carbon deposition. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation ï�§â€�Al2O3 (SAâ€�6175) with a Brunauerâ€�Emmettâ€�Teller (BET) area of 230 m 2 /g, Yâ€�zeolite (CBV500) with a BET area of 750 m 2 /g, and Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 (CBV2030E) with a BET area of 405 m 2 /g were used as supports. A series of Niâ€�based catalysts (the Ni content was fixed at 5 wt%) were prepared on the supports. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregâ€� nation method using Ni(NO3)2Â·6H2O as the metal precursor. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried overnight at 120 ï‚°C and then calcined at different temperatures, namely 500, 700, and 900 ï‚°C, for 3 h. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Phase identification of the prepared catalysts was carried out using Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD), with Cu KÎ± radiation, in the 2Î¸ range 0ï‚°â€“80ï‚° on a Unisantis XMDâ€�300 diffractometer. N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption isotherms were measured to examine the porous properties of each catalyst. The measurements were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Beâ€� fore the analyses, all the samples were pretreated under vacâ€� uum conditions at 200 Â°C for 12 h. Temperatureâ€�programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out using a Chemisorb Miâ€� cromeritics 2920 instrument to monitor the metal oxide reducâ€� tion. The sample was first pretreated in a flow of helium at 200 Â°C and then reduced under a flow (20 ml/min) of a 5.32% H2/N2 mixture. The sample was heated from 60 to 900 Â°C at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. After reaction at 700 Â°C for 9 h, temâ€� peratureâ€�programmed oxidation (TPO) was performed to study the reactivity of the carbon species by oxidizing the samâ€� ple under a flow of air while the temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 Â°C, linearly with time, at a heatâ€� ing rate of 10 Â°C/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts after use in the CO2 reforming of CH4. The analyses were performed using a TGA/differential thermal analysis (EXSTAR SII TG/DTA 7300) instrument; 10 mg of each sample were introduced into a platinum microbalance pan in an air atmosphere, and the heating rate was 10 Â°C/min. 2.3. Catalytic tests The CO2 reforming reaction of CH4 was carried out in a conâ€� tinuousâ€�flow reactor, at a pressure of 101.3 kPa and different temperatures (500, 600, and 700 Â°C), with a constant stoichioâ€� metric feed mixture of CH4 and CO2 (1:1) and a total flow rate of 36 ml/min. Samples of 0.6 g of catalyst were used for each catâ€� alytic test. The data were collected every 30 min on stream for 9 h. The reaction products were analyzed using an onâ€�line gas chromatograph (Varian Star 3400 CX). The details of the exâ€� perimental setup and procedure have been given in previous publications [20,21]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic activity The catalytic performances of 5 wt% Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, 5 wt% Ni/Yâ€�zeolite (denoted Ni/Y), and 5 wt% Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts were investigated at different calcination and reaction temperâ€� atures. Table 1 shows the effects of the calcination and reaction temperatures on CH4 and CO2 conversions for the Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts. It can be seen that the effect of the reaction temperature on the catalytic activity is more proâ€� nounced than the effect of the calcination temperature. For all calcination temperatures, an increase in the reaction temperaâ€� ture resulted in higher conversions of CH4 and CO2, confirming the endothermicity of the reaction. It can be seen from Table 1 that the Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalysts at all calcination and reaction temperatures, and the Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts at all calcination temperatures and a reaction temperâ€� ature of 700 Â°C, showed higher conversions of CO2 than of CH4. A similar trend was observed for the Ni/Y catalysts for calcinaâ€� tion temperatures of 500 Â°C (at a reaction temperature of 500 Â°C), 700 Â°C (at reaction temperatures of 500 and 600 Â°C), and 900 Â°C (at a reaction temperature of 500 Â°C). A CO2 conversion greater than that of CH4 is the result of the reverse water shift reaction, which consumes the formed H2, resulting in an H2/CO ratio less than one. For the Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts, for all calciâ€� nation temperatures and reaction temperatures of 500 and 600 Table 1 Activity tests for Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts with different calcination temperatures.

FAKEEHA et al./Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 764â€“768 Â Â°C, and for the Ni/Y catalysts, for all calcination temperatures and a reaction temperature of 600 Â°C, the higher CH4 converâ€� sion compared to CO2 conversion could be attributed to therâ€� mal cracking of CH4, leading to coke formation and, conseâ€� quently, an H2/CO ratio greater than one [21]. The data in Table 1 also shows the effect of calcination temâ€� perature on catalytic activity. It can be seen that for the Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts, at low reaction temperatures (500â€“600 Â°C), the catalytic activity is higher for a calcination temperature of 500 Â°C, whereas at a higher reaction temperature (700 Â°C), a calcination temperature of 900 Â°C leads to high activity. These differences could plausibly be atâ€� tributed to phase formation in the catalysts. 3.2. Catalytic stability Timeâ€�onâ€�stream conversions, amounts of coke deposited, and the surface areas of the fresh and spent catalysts are preâ€� sented in Table 2. It can be seen that both CH4 and CO2 converâ€� sions decreased over a time period of 9 h. The main reason for this deactivation of the catalysts was carbon deposition. Based on thermodynamics, at a high reaction temperature (>650 Â°C) coke is expected to be formed mainly via CH4 deâ€� composition (reaction (1) below). TGA was used to estimate the amounts of carbon deposited. It is clear from Table 2 that the average amount of carbon deposited on Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 (5.9 wt%) was much less than the amounts deposited on Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3 (8.5 wt%) and Ni/Y (12.0 wt%). This proves the higher stability of the Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalyst and lower carbon deposition on its surface; the stabilities of the catalysts are in the order Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 > Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3 > Ni/Y. 3.3. Catalyst characterization Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns for fresh Ni/Y and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts calcined at different temperatures. It can be seen that Ni/Y and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 passivated catalysts calcined at 500, 700, and 900 Â°C showed the diffraction peaks of NiO(111), NiO(200), and NiO(220) at 2Î¸ = 37.2Â°, 44Â°, and 62.5Â° (JCPDS 04â€�850), respectively.

FAKEEHA et al./Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 764â€“768 Â figure shows carbon formation on the catalyst surfaces (with Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 having the lowest amount). This deposition of carbon is in agreement with the TGA results listed in Table 2. TPO is a useful technique for investigating carbon deposiâ€� tion in more detail. TPO provides important information reâ€� garding accumulated carbon species, and their structures, amounts, and compositions. It is widely recognized that amorâ€� phous carbon species can be combusted at lower temperatures than crystalline species, i.e., the oxidation temperature inâ€� creases with increasing degree of crystallinity. Figure 3 disâ€� plays the signals of generated CO2 for the three catalysts as a function of temperature. The spent catalysts calcined at 900 Â°C showed a significant CO2 release peak at 450â€“620 Â°C, which can be related to combustion of different crystalline forms of carâ€� bon, e.g., carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes. Generally speaking, the most probable reactions leading to carbon forâ€� mation during reforming processes are those shown in Equaâ€� tions (1)â€“(4): CH4 â†” 2H2 + C (1) 2CO â†” CO2 + C (2) CO + H2 â†” H2O + C (3) 2 + 2H2 â†” 2H2O + C (4) Reactions (2), (3), and (4) are favored at low temperatures (<575 ï‚°C); CH4 decomposition (reaction (1)) takes place at higher temperatures, and is therefore the prime cause of carâ€� bon formation [22]. Figure 4 presents the TPR results for fresh and used Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts. The fresh Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 500 and 900 Â°C showed three peaks in the temperature range 420â€“800 Â°C, and the fresh Ni/Y catalysts calcined at 500, 700, and 900 Â°C showed three peaks in the temperature range 500â€“800 Â°C. The fresh Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalyst calcined at 500 Â°C showed two peaks, at 350 and 470 Â°C, and a shoulder at 575 Â°C. The lowâ€�temperature peaks can be assigned to NiO reduction as a result of very low metalâ€“support interactions, and the highâ€�temperature peak is assigned to reâ€� duction of NiO particles with high interaction with the support. The peak for the fresh Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 900 Â°C at around 800 Â°C is attributed to reduction of spinel NiAl2O4. For the fresh Ni/Y catalyst calcined at 900 Â°C, the peak at 750 Â°C can be attributed to the reduction of Ni 2+ hexagonal prisms, and for the fresh Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalyst calcined at 900 Â°C, the peak at around 600 Â°C can be related to NiO particles of a different size. In contrast, the Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 spent cataâ€� lysts showed only one peak, in the temperature range 300â€“600 ï‚°C, which can be attributed to a methanation reaction, i.e. the reaction of H2 with carbon deposited on the catalyst surface (reverse of reaction (1) above). 4. Conclusions CO2 reforming of CH4 is efficiently catalyzed by supported Ni catalysts. The activity towards CH4 conversion was found to depend on the nature of the support material.

ALâ€�FATESH, Ahmed E. ABASAEED * King Saud University, Saudi Arabia In dry reforming of methane, the Ni catalyst supported on Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 zeolite was found to be more stable than those supported on aluâ€� mina or Yâ€�zeolite. k at around 600 Â°C can be related to NiO particles of a different size. In contrast, the Ni/Î³â€�Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 spent cataâ€� lysts showed only one peak, in the temperature range 300â€“600 ï‚°C, which can be attributed to a methanation reaction, i.e. the reaction of H2 with carbon deposited on the catalyst surface (reverse of reaction (1) above). 4. Conclusions CO2 reforming of CH4 is efficiently catalyzed by supported Ni catalysts. The activity towards CH4 conversion was found to depend on the nature of the support material. H2/CO ratios close to unity and lower carbon deposition leading to high staâ€� bility were obtained for Ni/Hâ€�ZSMâ€�5 catalysts. These findings were confirmed using XRD, EDS, TPO, and TPR techniques. 200 400 600 800 Used, 900 o C 900 o C T C D s i g n a l T C D s i g n a l T C D s i g n a l Ni/ï�§-Al 2 O 3 500 o C Ni/Y Used, 900 o C 900 o C 500 o C Temperature (ï‚°C) Ni/H-ZSM-5 Used, 900 o C 900 o C 500 o C Fig. 3.

Tel: +966-1-4676856; Fax: +966-1-4678770 Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni/Y-zeolite, and Ni/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Their catalytic performance in dry reforming of methane was studied. The fresh and used catalysts and deposited carbon were characterized using H2 temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed oxidation, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The H-ZSM-5-supported Ni catalyst proved to be more stable than the other two catalysts, as it had the lowest carbon deposition.
