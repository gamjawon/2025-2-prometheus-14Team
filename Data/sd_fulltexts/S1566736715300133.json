An efficient manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves OMS-2-catalyzed chemoselective synthesis of 1,4-enediones and 1,4-diketones from 1,3-dicarbonyls and α-iodoacetophenones is described. The present catalytic system can be applied in one-pot, three-component reactions of methyl ketones, 1,3-dicarbonyls and iodine. Moreover, OMS-2 can be reused at least 5 times without loss of activity. Keywords Heterogeneous catalysis OMS-2 C–C bond formation 1,4-Enediones 1,4-Diketones 1 Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis plays an important role in a wide range of applications, due to convenient catalyst handling, recyclability of catalyst, and easy separation of catalyst from reaction medium [1–4]. As a mixed valent material, OMS-2 (cryptomelane-type manganese oxide-based octahedral molecular sieves, KMn8O16) has captured broad attention and also been applied to catalysis, ion-exchange, battery materials and adsorption because it is crystalline and semi-conductive [5]. OMS-2 has a 2×2 edge- and corner-shared MnO6 octahedral chain, which is corner connected to form a one-dimensional tunnel structure with a pore size of 4.6Å, and shows ~3.8 as the average oxidation state [6,7]. Previously, OMS-2 had been used as a heterogeneous catalyst in oxidation [8], cyanation [9], dehydrogenation [10], epoxidation [11], ring opening [12], as well as the synthesis of imines, amides, quinoxalines, and 2-aminodiphenylamines [13–17]. 1,4-Enediones are not only important structural motifs in natural products and pharmaceutical compounds [18], but also versatile building blocks for the synthesis of heterocycles [19]. Many synthetic routes have been established, including oxidation of furans and enones [20], rearrangement of 2-alkynyl alcohols [21], Stille coupling [22], Wittig reaction [23], nucleophilic addition of dibenzoylacetylenes and oxidative coupling [24]. Most recently, Wu's group reported an oxidative synthesis of 1,4-enediones from acetophenones and 1,3-dicarbonyls mediated by stoichiometric amounts of CuO and I2 [25]. However, these approaches are not eco-friendly and generally suffer from limited substrate scope. Therefore, there is an incentive to develop a convenient and straightforward approach for producing 1,4-enediones by environmentally friendly way with a recyclable catalyst. In continuation of our research towards heterogeneous catalysis [26–28], we would like to describe a heterogeneous OMS-2-catalyzed chemoselective synthesis of 1,4-enediones and 1,4-diketones from α-iodoacetophenones and 1,3-dicarbonyls. This synthetic method avoids using stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents, which can be an alternative to previous methods (Scheme 1 ). 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation [26] 5.89g of KMnO4 in 100mL of water was added to a solution of 8.8g of MnSO4 ·H2O in 30mL of water and 3mL concentrated HNO3. The solution was refluxed at 100°C for 24h, and the product was filtered, washed, and dried at 120°C for 8h. Finally, the dry OMS-2 was calcined in a muffle furnace at 350°C for 2h. Then, the black powder OMS-2 was obtained. BET surface area: 158.4870m2/g; pore volume: 0.5249cm3/g; pore size: 127.058Å. 2.2 Characterization The specific surface areas (SBET) of the catalysts were measured from a multipoint Braunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77K recorded on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 apparatus. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts were obtained on a JEM2010 microscope operated at 200kV. The sample was dispersed into ethanol with ultrasonic treatment for 1h, and drops of the suspension were placed on a copper grid for TEM observations. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.1542nm). The working voltage was 40kV and the current was 40mA. The intensity data were collected at 25°C in a 2θ range from 10° to 90°, with a scanning speed of 0.7° s−1 and a step of 0.03°. 2.3 General procedure for the synthesis of 1.4-enedione OMS-2 (12mg, 0.015mmol, 5mol%), α-iodoacetophenone (0.3mmol), 1,3-dicarbonyl compound (0.3mmol), DCB (1mL) were added to a flask with a stirring bar. The mixture was stirred at 100°C for 12h under air. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and filtered. The filtrate was removed under reduced pressure to get the crude product, which was further purified by silica gel chromatography to yield corresponding product. 2.4 General procedure for the synthesis of 1,4-diketones OMS-2 (12mg, 0.015mmol, 5mol%), α-iodoacetophenone (0.3mmol), 1,3-dicarbonyl compound (0.3mmol), EtOH (1mL) were added to a flask with a stirring bar. The mixture was stirred at 70°C for 12h under air. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and filtered. The filtrate was removed under reduced pressure to get the crude product, which was further purified by silica gel chromatography to yield corresponding product. 3 Results and discussion In our initial study, the reaction between α-iodoacetophenone 1a and 1,3-dicarbonyl compound 2a was chosen as a model reaction (Tables 1 and S1). Firstly, the reaction did not proceed without a catalyst in DMSO (Table 1, entry 1). Using OMS-2 as a catalyst in DCB also failed the transformation (Table 1, entry 2). Interestingly, increasing reaction temperature to 100°C enabled the formation of 1,4-enedione 3a with E/Z mixture in 92% yield (Table 1, entry 3). Next, more experiments confirmed that increasing or decreasing OMS-2 loading did not enhance reactivity and the reaction did not occur without OMS-2 even at a higher temperature (Table 1, entries 4–6). Using MnSO4 and KMnO4 that are precursors of OMS-2 as catalysts gave inferior results (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Moreover, MnO2 was tested and it did not trigger the reaction at all (Table 1, entry 9). Surprisingly, the reaction offered 98% yield of 1,4-diketone 4a [29] instead of 3a in EtOH at 70°C via nucleophilic substitution (Table 1, entry 10). Then, more experiments were conducted in EtOH to better the yield of 4a and results showed that the reaction did not work without OMS-2, and decreasing reaction temperature slowed down the transformation (Table 1, entries 11–13). Finally, the formation of 4a also worked efficiently under nitrogen (Table 1, entry 14). In order to prove that the observed catalysis is derived from the solid catalyst OMS-2 rather than the leached Mn species, the hot filtration experiment was conducted (see ESI, Fig. S1) and the results suggested that the observed catalysis is heterogeneous. Then, the recyclability of OMS-2 on the synthesis of 1,4-enedione 3a was investigated (Table 2 ). After each run, OMS-2 was separated by filtration and washed with deionized water and EtOH respectively, then dried at 110°C for 4h. It was found that OMS-2 can be reused at least 5 times without obvious loss of activity. Then, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize the fresh and retrieved OMS-2 (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Specifically, the TEM image of OMS-2 demonstrated that the fresh catalyst was composed of short nanorods which were structurally single crystalline (Fig. 1, A). Additionally, the TEM image showed retrieved OMS-2 which was used for 1cycle maintained the morphology and lattice structure (Fig. 1, B). The XRD pattern of OMS-2 showed peaks which can be indexed to the pure cryptomelane phase consistent with JCPDS file No. 29–1020. Reused OMS-2 was also characterized by XRD, which confirmed that the structure of it was not altered even after the fifth cycle (Fig. 2). TEM and XRD revealed that OMS-2 has good structural stability. With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we examined the scope of the C–C bond formation between α-iodoacetophenones and 1,3-dicarbonyls using OMS-2 as the catalyst in DCB (Table 3 ). Gratifyingly, the reactions were tolerant of various substrates and gave moderate to good yields of corresponding 1,4-enediones with mixture of major thermodynamically stable E-isomers and minor Z-isomers. Electron-rich iodoacetophenones offered slightly higher yields of 1,4-enediones than electron-poor ones did (Table 3, b–i). Heterocyclic α-iodoketone, 1-(furan-2-yl)-2-iodoethanone, also proceeded in a good yield (Table 3, j). On the other hand, various 1,3-dicarbonyls participated in the reactions and good yields were obtained (Table 3, k–o). Unfortunately, aliphatic α-iodoketones, such as 1-iodobutan-2-one and 1-iodopropan-2-one, did not participate in the reactions and aliphatic acetylacetone was not a suitable substrate for this catalytic system. And α-bromo acetophenone did not react under the present reaction conditions. Since the excellent chemoselectivity of this heterogeneous catalytic system, a number of 1,4-diketones were synthesized via OMS-2-catalyzed nucleophilic substitutions in EtOH (Table 4 ). In all cases, the desired 1,4-diketones were obtained chemoselectively. Ortho-substituted α-iodoacetophenones gave low yields of 1,4-diketones, which indicates that the reaction was affected by steric hindrance of the substrates (Table 4, b–m). 1,3-Dicarbonyls with substitutions underwent reactions to furnish desired products in excellent yields (Table 4, n and o). When aliphatic acetylacetone was employed as a substrate, the desired product 4p was isolated in a low yield of 8%. However, the reactions of aliphatic α-iodoketones, such as 1-iodobutan-2-one and 1-iodopropan-2-one, did not occur under the present reaction conditions. Because α-iodoacetophenones are easily formed from corresponding acetophenones with iodine [26,30,31], the one-pot, three-component reactions of I2, acetophenones and 1,3-dicarbonyls catalyzed by OMS-2 to yield 1,4-enediones and 1,4-diketones were smoothly realized (see ESI, Scheme S1). Based on the previous reports [25,30,31] and control experiments we performed (see ESI, Scheme S2), α-ketoaldehyde A (Scheme S2) probably is an intermediate during the oxidative synthesis of 1,4-enedione. In the presence of OMS-2, α-ketoaldehyde A that is formed from α-iodoacetophenone under air reacts with 1,3-dicarbonyl via Knoevenagel condensation to afford the desired 1,4-enedione after loss of H2O [32]. In EtOH, 1,4-diketone is generated by OMS-2-assisted nucleophilic substitution between electrophilic α-iodoacetophenone and nucleophilic 1,3-dicarbonyl compound. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a heterogeneous OMS-2-catalyzed oxidative C–C bond formation between α-iodoacetophenones and 1,3-dicarbonyls for the synthesis of 1,4-enediones. By changing the reaction solvent, the catalytic system can afford high yields of 1,4-diketones. This simple catalytic system tolerates a variety of substrates and can be performed in one-pot, three-component reaction of acetophenones, 1,3-dicarbonyls and I2. Furthermore, OMS-2 can be reused 5 times without loss of catalytic activity. Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21403256, 21372102).
