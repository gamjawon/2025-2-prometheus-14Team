Graphical abstract An Fe modified USY catalyst was built for ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol to ethyl levulinate. Characterization results confirmed that Fe species was existed in the form of Fe2O3, and Fe/USY is modified by Fe2O3 in two aspects, viz., the strong acidic sites were sharply reduced, and also a large number of weak acid sites were generated. The first aspect effectively suppressed the oligomerization reaction of furfuryl alcohol and formation of diethyl ether, while the enhanced weak acid sites guaranteed activity of the catalyst. Finally, a 90.6% yield of ethyl levulinate was obtained under optimization conditions for four successive runs. Keywords Ethanolysis Ethyl levulinate Furfuryl alcohol Fe/USY 1 Introduction Regarding the trend of fossil energy exhaustion and the demand of improving environment, the exploiting of renewable biomass resource attracted more and more attention [1–3]. As a kind of potential green biomass based platform compounds, ethyl levulinate (EL) maintained high chemical activity due to a carbonyl and an ester group in its molecular structure. EL are widely used in medicine and health, perfumes, elasticizers and other industries. In addition, EL was also used as a novel form of liquid fuel additive, which would dramatically reduce the depletion of fossil energy [4–6]. In recent years, the synthesis of EL has become a quite important research subject among the researchers [5–8]. EL can be produced in a routine way, viz., esterification of levulinic acid with ethanol over acid catalyst [6–8]. Although several pioneering works developed an effective way to produce levulinic acid from acid hydrolysis of various feedstock. Levulinic acid is still a high costly raw material for EL production due to its hard separation and purification from the acid hydrolysis mixture [9]. Therefore, it is strongly demanded to establish an efficient EL production route from widely available and low cost raw material. Furfuryl alcohol (FAL) is easily obtained from the hydrogenation of furfural, and furfural can be produced from hemicellulose-rich biomass [10,11]. It has been proved that EL can be effectively obtained through ethanolysis of FAL over acidic catalysts [12]. Every year, hundreds of thousands of furfural were produced, thus FAL was considered to be a lower-cost starting material for EL production [9–12]. Recently, many kinds of acid catalysts such as metal salts, mineral acids, ion-exchange resins, zeolites, and hybrid acid have been attempted for ethanolysis of FAL to EL [12–15]. Although, high yield of EL were achieved in these pioneering works, more efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly catalysts are still desirable. In recent studies, zeolite have been widely used in conversion of biomass to bio-fuels or value-added chemicals reactions due to their tunable acidity and three-dimensional porosity [16–19]. Therefore, it is surely an interesting exploration to investigate the ethanolysis of FAL to EL over zeolite based catalysts. Herein, we report our studies about ethanolysis of FAL to EL with Fe modified zeolite catalysts. The reaction was monitored and the intermediates or by-products were identified by GC–MS. Based on the insights on the reaction pathway, a catalyst modification strategy was developed, and the obtained catalyst was intensively researched via several physical methods. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials USY, HZSM-5 and Hβ powder were supplied by Nankai University catalyst Co., Ltd. SiO2 was provided by Qingdao Hailang silica-gel drier factory. γ-Al2O3 were purchased from the Aluminum Corporation of China, Zibo, China. FAL was supplied by Shandong Yino Biologic Materials Co., Ltd. Ferric trichloride was acquired from Tianjin Guangfu Fine chemical institute. 2.2 Catalyst preparation All the commercially available catalysts were used for the ethanolysis reaction without further pretreatment except for being dried at 120°C for 8h. Fe species modified USY catalyst was prepared by wetness impregnation method. Taking 3%Fe/USY as an example, the catalyst preparation procedure can be described in brief as follows. USY powders (10g) were impregnated with 17mL aqueous solution of 0.3g FeCl3, 4h later the mixture was separated by filtration. Being dried at 120°C for 6h, the filter cake was milled and impregnated with the remained filtrate for another 4h. And then, the solid mixture was dried at 120°C for 6h and calcined at 400°C for 5h. 2.3 Catalysts characterization N2 sorption were measured using a NOVA 2000e analyzer (Quantachrome, US). The catalysts were degassed at 250°C for 2h under vacuum before liquid N2 adsorption and the isotherms were taken at 77K. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaka D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer, using Cu-Kα radiation and scanning 2θ from 5° to 50°, operated at 40kV and 100mA. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was carried out on a TP-5080 instrument. In a typical experiment for NH3-TPD, the catalyst was activated at 300°C for 2h by passage of He gas. Then it was saturated with NH3 and He mixture gas at 100°C for 1h and subsequently flushed with He gas at 100°C for 1h. Finally, the TPD of catalyst was performed at heating rate of 10°C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of catalyst samples were obtained using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. The nature of the acid sites (Brønsted and Lewis) was distinguished by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. The ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidity was determined based on the method reported in previous literature [16]. 2.4 Catalytic test The ethanolysis reaction was performed on a stainless steel autoclave. In a typical procedure, FAL (2.5g), ethanol (97.5g) and a certain amount of catalyst (Based on the Solution weight) were sealed into the reactor, then the reaction mixture was heated to 120°C through an electrical heating system under vigorous stirring. After reacted for 4h, the reaction was quenched by cooling water, and then the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and the liquid sample was analyzed by GC–MS (HP 6890/5793 gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer equipped with a FID detector and DB-5 capillary column, 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The temperature of the column increased from 100°C to 240°C at 10°Cmin−1. The temperature of the injection port and detector was 260°C. In the present studies, the conversion and product yields were obtained from GC analysis based on the internal standard method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst modification In the present studies different solid acids were investigated, and the obtained results are listed in Table 1 . It was found the ethanolysis reaction could not be conducted without any catalyst, SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 catalyst yields a quite poor amount of EL. Clearly, the quite low EL yield (less than 20%) over these catalysts is a result of the weak acidic capacity of these catalysts at relatively mild reaction conditions. All zeolite catalysts afforded high EL yield than the normal oxide catalysts, and the highest EL yield of 73.7% was collected for USY. To identify the composition of ethanolysis reaction mixture, the liquid sample obtained over USY was analyzed by GC–MS. It was found that besides EL, FAL and amounts of diethyl ether, 2-(ethoxymethyl)furan, 4,5-diethoxy-5-hydroxype ntan-2-one, 4,5,5-triethoxypentan-2-one, angelica lactone isomers (α- and β- angelica lactone), 2,2′-Methylenebis(furan), 2-Furaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2,5-bis(2-furanylmethyl)furan and others (Too little to be identify their real structure) were also detected in the reaction mixture. The carbon balance for all catalysts were less than 100%. The loss of the carbon might be converted into humin during the reaction (the solution turned to dark-brown), which cannot be detected by GC. The reaction pathway of ethanolysis of FAL to give EL is put forward based on the obtained GC–MS results and literatures [9,15], which is illustrated in Scheme 1 . The ethanolysis reaction mechanism is rather complex since FAL may be converted into EL through different reaction pathways. In addition, FAL may undergo oligomerization reaction under acidic conditions. Obviously, the quite poor yield of EL is due to the complicated ethanolysis reaction over USY catalyst. From the GC–MS results and above analysis, we can get to know that besides FAL and EL, the components in the reaction mixture can be classified into three categories. The first is diethyl ether (DEE), which was formed through the dehydration reaction of two ethanol molecular over the catalyst, and the formation of DEE surely leading to a “non-productive” consumption of ethanol. The second is the reaction intermediates, which contains 2-(ethoxymethyl)furan, 4,5-diethoxy-5-hydroxypentan-2-one, 4,5,5-triethoxypentan-2-one, and angelica lactone isomers. The third can be named as the by-product, which contains 2,2′-Methylenebis(furan), 2-Furaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2,5-bis(2-furanylmethyl)furan. Nowadays, catalytic transformation of ethanol into valuable chemicals over acidic catalyst attracted mountains of attention [20]. It has been confirmed that during this transformation reaction, ethanol is firstly adsorbed as ethoxy species on the Brønsted acid sites of the catalyst and then the adsorbed ethoxy species form diethyl ether [21]. Thus, it is easily to infer that the decrease of the Brønsted acid sites of the catalyst may effectively shrink amounts diethyl ether in the present studies. To clarify the source of by-products, the same amount of EL instead of FAL was injected to the reactor and followed the same reaction procedures. The analysis of liquid phase reaction mixture demonstrated that EL is quite stable during the catalytic reaction, since the conversion of EL was less than 1.0%. Thus, it is easily to infer that the by-products were not formed from the decomposition of the EL, but probably are produced through the oligomerization of FAL under acidic conditions. The stronger the acidic strength, the higher catalytic activity of catalyst for the oligomerization of FAL. According to the reaction mechanism, the ethanolysis reaction can be activated by either Brønsted acid site or Lewis acid site, and the Brønsted acid sites always exhibit more robust acidic strength than Lewis acid site. So, if we kill some of the strong or medium acid sites, while increase the weak acid sites of the USY catalyst may inhibit the by-products. Surely, diethyl ether, the intermediates and by-products are produced inevitably. However, based on the above results we have no reason to doubt that the yield of EL could be improved through the modification of acidic properties of the catalyst. Based on the above analysis, the strong acid sites of the catalyst should be modified to further improve its the catalytic performance. Several previous studies have proved that the incorporation of metals, especially Fe species into a zeolite unit could change its acidic strength distribution [22,23]. In view of this, Fe species modified USY catalysts were prepared and were employed for the ethanolysis reaction. In an attempt to verify our previous inference, the separate experiments were performed without FAL under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 , the formation of diethyl ether was remarkably diminished by the doped Fe species. The catalytic performance of these Fe species modified catalysts on ethanolysis of FAL to give EL were listed in Table 2 . As described in Table 2, along with the increased Fe species loading to the catalyst, conversion of FAL and yield of by-products decreased obviously, while the amounts of intermediates increased slightly. The best yield of EL reached to 73.6% over 5%Fe/USY catalyst. Table 2 also displayed that when the loading of Fe species more than 5wt%, the yield of EL was slightly decreased. These results indicated that the catalytic performance of USY in ethanolysis of FAL reaction were evidently influenced by the introduced Fe species, and 5%Fe/USY displayed the best catalytic performance, over which only small amount of by-products and DEE were collected. 3.2 Catalysts characterization To better understand the effects of doped Fe species on the catalytic performance, USY and Fe modified catalysts were investigated by some physical methods. 3.2.1 N2 sorption Table 3 displays the surface area, pore volume of USY and Fe/USY catalysts. It can be found that the impregnation of Fe species apparently changed the porosity properties of USY catalysts. The total area and micropore volume of the catalysts reduced from 635.5m2/g and 0.36m2/g to 422.2m2/g and 0.245m2/g with the increasing loading amounts of Fe species, respectively. These results demonstrated the Fe species were successfully loaded in the interior of the zeolite pores or channels. However, the micropore volume for USY is still very high, indicating the main structure of USY was kept intact during the catalyst preparation process. Similar results were also reported in previous studies [23]. 3.2.2 XRD Fig. 2 displayed that the XRD patterns of USY and Fe modified USY are almost identical, which confirmed that the introduction of Fe species via impregnation process has no obvious effect on the USY structure; this result was in consistent with N2 sorption characteristics of USY and Fe/USY catalysts. However, less intense XRD peaks of Fe/USY compared to that of USY zeolite was observed for these catalysts, which indicates that impregnation of Fe species on USY led to decrease in its crystallinity, similar phenomena were also reported in previous studies [16]. It had been reported the doped Fe species would be oxidized and generated iron oxide compound during the calcinations process [24]. However, the typical peaks of formed iron oxide (Fe2O3) could not be detected in these XRD patterns. The results are probable attributed to the non-crystalline phase of these Fe species. 3.2.3 FT-IR In order to further understand the influence of Fe species, FT-IR spectra of these samples were presented in Fig. 3 . All the IR spectras of these catalysts exhibited two typical main regions of zeolite, which could be attributed to the framework vibration of lattice cell (1300–400cm−1) and the hydroxyl groups (4000–3000cm−1), respectively [25]. And no obviously band position shift could be observed on the FT-IR spectra, demonstrated that the main framework of USY remained intact after loading of Fe species, which was in accordance with the XRD and N2 sorption discussion results. It should be noted that, there were still without IR spectra of Fe2O3 were detected on modified USY catalysts. 3.2.4 XPS According to previous studies, the introduced Fe species may exist in the form of Fe2O3. However, both of XRD and FT-IR results did not present the evidence of the existed Fe2O3. So to further investigate the type of Fe species, XPS characterization of 5%Fe/USY was performed. The spin-orbit split doublet of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 could be observed on the XPS spectra of Fe 2p (Fig. 4 ), which confirmed that Fe presented on the catalyst in the form of Fe3+ species. In addition, the obvious peak for oxygen atoms connected with metal ions was observed in Fig. 5 . Therefore, these results confirmed that the Fe species on the Fe/USY was existed in the form of Fe2O3, which was in consistent with previous studies [23]. 3.2.5 Acidity The acid properties of USY based catalysts were determined by NH3-TPD, and the obtained NH3 desorption curves were depicted in Fig. 6 . All USY based catalysts showed two typical NH3 desorption peaks, which could be ascribed to the weak (120–300°C) and strong (400–500°C) acid sites, respectively [26]. The amount of disaggregated NH3 of all the catalysts was quantified based on the area of the NH3 desorption peaks, and listed in Table 4 . It can be seen that the strong acid sites on USY were effectively suppressed after Fe species loading, which may substitute parts of the Brønsted acid protons of USY during the ion impregnation process [27]. The NH3-TPD results also demonstrated that weak acid sites of the catalyst was evidently increased firstly and then slightly decreased with the increases of Fe species loading, which may be attributed to the formation of new Lewis acid sites of Fe(OH)2+ [19]. The total acid sites followed the same trend with the number of weak acid sites, and the highest total acidity was observed on 5%Fe/USY. The total acidity of 10%Fe/USY was lower than 5%Fe/USY catalyst although the Fe species loading was higher. This is probably due to the presence of Fe2O3 probably partially covered the acidic sites on USY catalyst surface, thus reducing the catalyst acidity, and similar results has been reported previously [25,28]. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine were observed to distinguish the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7 , the intensity of the band assigned to Brønsted acid sites (BA) (around 1545cm−1) was decreased while the intensity of the band assigned to Lewis acid sites (LA) density (around 1450cm−1) was increased with the increases of Fe species loading. The molar ratio of BA to LA was listed in Table 4, which was calculated based on the peak area in Fig. 7. As shown in Table 4, the molar ratio of BA to LA is found to be decreased gradually with increase in Fe2O3 loading. The result implies that, Fe/USY zeolite catalysts exhibited higher Lewis acid sites compared to Brønsted acid sites. The increment of Fe species loading resulted in lower molar ratio of BA to LA. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the formation of diethyl ether were remarkably diminished by the doped Fe species. Clearly, these NH3 desorption and infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine results confirmed our previous inference that reduction of the strong acid sites on the catalyst could effectively shrink amounts of the formed diethyl ether. Based on the NH3 desorption results and Table 2, it seems that conversion of FAL was mainly influenced by strong acid sites on the catalyst, since it is slightly reduced with the decreased of the strong acidic capacity on the catalysts. Table 2 demonstrated that with the increased of Fe species loading the formation of by-products were successfully suppressed. Clearly, this result followed the order of the strong acidity of these catalysts. And these results also proved that strong acid sites are favorable for oligomerization of FAL. All in all, the above results suggested that the acid strength of the catalyst was a key factor for the formation of EL. In other words, a conclusion can be reached that the decrease of strong acid sites could suppress the oligomerization of FAL and formation of Diethyl ether, while the enhanced weak acid sites guaranteed activity of the catalyst. Thus the catalyst modification strategy used in our studies was effectively to built an efficient catalyst (5%Fe/USY) for the FAL ethanolysis reaction, which has moderately strong acid sites and the most total acid sites. 3.3 Optimization of process parameters Since, 5%Fe/USY exhibited the excellent catalytic performance for the ethanolysis reaction, the reaction conditions were optimized to further investigate its catalytic performance. 3.3.1 Influence of reaction time As seen in Table 2, quite amounts of intermediates were detected in the liquid reaction mixture. To further improve the yield of EL, the reaction time was investigated from 2h to 6h. As shown in Fig. 8 , conversion of FAL was slightly increased with the elevation of reaction time. While the reaction intermediates decreased obviously, leading to a gradually increasing of EL yield. However, when the reaction time was further increased from 4h, both conversion of FAL and yield of EI did not change significantly, which could be ascribed to fact that the equilibrium for the reaction was almost reached. Thus, 4h was chosen as the best reaction time. 3.3.2 Influence of temperature As shown in Fig. 9 , the conversion of FAL was increased with the elevation of reaction temperature. The EL yield gradually increased while the reaction intermediates decreased to a negligible level. and reached a maximum point at 130°C. The maximum EL yield was reached at 130°C, and then it was gradually decreased when further lifting the temperature to 140°C. Therefore, the appropriate reaction temperature for the present reaction was 130°C. 3.3.3 Influence of catalyst dosage As shown in Fig. 10 , along with the increased catalyst dosage, EL yield increased firstly to the maximum value and then gradually decreased. This was attributed to the increase of the acid active sites which can promote the conversions of the reaction. However, over loading of the catalyst to 3.0wt.% led to a decrease in the EL yield and more side reactions. Therefore, 3.0wt.% was the best catalyst dosage for the present reaction. 3.4 Catalyst recycling Stability of the obtained catalyst was investigated under the optimization reaction conditions. The spent 5%Fe/USY catalyst was separated through centrifugation, washed with dichloromethane, dried overnight at 120°C, and then the catalyst was added into the reactor along with FAL and alcohol for the catalytic tests again. As shown in Fig. 11 , the catalytic performance of 5%Fe/USY was almost unchanged within 4 runs. To further evaluate the catalytic performance of the 5%Fe/USY. For comparison, several previous reported catalysts such as sulfated oxides, AlCl3 and Amberlyst-15 were used instead of the 5%Fe/USY [9,12,29]. Lower EL yields were obtained over these catalysts (Table 5 ). Therefore, the obtained results confirmed that 5%Fe/USY is a stable and recyclable catalyst and efficient catalyst for the ethanolysis of bio-based FAL to give EL. 4 Conclusion In this study, efficient conversion of furfuryl alcohol to ethyl levulinate was carried out over Fe modified Fe/USY catalysts in ethanol. Among which, the 5%Fe/USY showed the best catalytic ability with the highest ethyl levulinate yield of 90.6%. This demonstrated that the modification of USY catalysts with Fe species by wetness impregnation method apparently effectively to built an efficient catalyst for the transformation of furfuryl alcohol to ethyl levulinate.
