In the 1960s, on the basis of extensive investigations, DICP re- searchers summarized a series of rules for governing the preparation of hydroisomerization and hydrocracking catalysts. By utilizing these rules as guidelines, DICP investigators have developed hydrocracking catalysts suitable for use in a single-stage process of vacuum gas oil hydrocracking. The catalysts as well as the process were then commercialized successfully in the first hydrocracking unit of China, which was constructed in Daqing Refinery with a capacity of 400 kt/a in 1967. Starting from 2000, DICP investigators have developed new generations of zeolite-based hydroisomerization catalysts, which were deployed in the 200 kt/a isodewaxing unit of Daqing Refining and Chemical Co. for base-oil feedstocks in 2008. Key words: hydrocracking; hydroisomerization; bifunctional catalyst Hydroisomerization of hydrocarbons is an important process in petroleum refining, mainly used for producing high quality fuels and lubrication oils. Hydroisomerization of light hydro- carbons can yield high octane fractions for gasoline blending, while hydroisomerization of long-chain alkanes can be em- ployed for improving the low-temperature fluidity of middle distillates (e.g., jet fuels and diesels) or lubrication oils. On the other hand, hydroisocracking (abbreviated as â€œhydrocrackingâ€�) is a process for maximal production of middle distillates from residual oils, which constitutes the most important means for satisfying the demand in jet fuels. The successful development of the hydrocracking process signified a brilliant advance in the history of petroleum refining technologies. The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (DICP) was formerly the Dalian Institute of Pe- troleum (DIP), which was the first specialized institute for petroleum and fuel R&D in China. In the early 1950s, due to the lacking of petroleum resources in our country, DIP had done a great number of investigations on the hydrogenation of shale oils and coal tar for production of premium fuels. On the basis of these investigations, processes for high pressure fixed-bed liquid phase hydrogenation of shale oils and high pressure or medium pressure slurry bed hydrogenation of low-temperature coal tar have been developed, which had been operated up to the pilot or demo plant scales [1,2]. These ac- complishments have laid a solid foundation for the subsequent research work of DICP (transformed from DIP in 1964) in the R&D of catalytic hydrogenation technologies for petroleum feedstocks. During the 1960s, large petroleum resources were found in China, and the R&D of petroleum refining technologies be- came one of the most demanding tasks in the petroleum in- dustry of China. Facing the new challenges, and by taking the advantage of ample experiences in hydrocarbon hydrogenation and hydrocracking gained previously, DICP researchers have achieved new successes in the development of unique hydro- cracking catalysts and processes for the treating of petroleum feedstocks. In this paper, a review on the progressing course of DICP in the R&D of hydrocracking and hydroisomerization catalysts for petroleum refining is presented. TIAN Zhijian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 705â€“710 1 R&D of catalysts for hydroisomerization of paraffinic kerosines to low-freezing jet fuels In the early 1960s, jet fuel supply to China was cut off from abroad due to political situations, and we were facing an urgent need for producing jet fuels on our own technologies. At that time, the newly discovered Daqing oil field could provide enough oils for our countryâ€™s daily consumption. However, the Daqing crudes were highly paraffinic in nature, and conven- tional petroleum processing techniques were not adequate to manufacture jet fractions from them. On the basis of our previous experience in the R&D of catalysts for shale oil and coal tar hydrogenation, Lin, Zhang, and Liang succeeded in producing low-freezing jet kerosines from straight-run paraffinic kerosene fractions via hydroi- somerization in 1960. The core of the paraffinic hydrocarbon hydroisomerization process was developing an adequate cata- lyst. A large number of studies on reaction mechanisms have elucidated that the isomerization of straight chain paraffins proceeds via intermediate steps of carbonium ion formation, and these steps can be realized only on dual-functional cata- lysts, i.e., catalysts comprising both metal components and acidic components. It has also been known that the two reac- tions, hydroisomerization and hydrocracking, are two com- peting reactions via the same carbonium intermediate species. Accordingly, for the sake of attaining maximum yields in middle distillates or lubricating oil fractions from heavy feed- stocks, it is apt to minimize the occurring of the hydrocracking reaction. In a word, the key factor in the successful develop- ment of a novel catalyst for paraffinic heavy feedstocks lies in a sophisticated monitoring of the selectivity of the catalyst. Lin, Zhang, and co-workers, based on the summarizing of a great number of reported data, were able to propose a series of rules that have proved to be versatile guidelines for the prepa- ration of tailored hydroisomerization and hydrocracking cata- lysts for hydrocarbon processing. These rules were designated as the â€œhybridization rules of electronic and acidic interac- tionsâ€�, and the main points are as follows. (1) The metal (i.e., the electronic component) and the support (i.e., the acidic component) of the catalyst interact with each other to form a hybridized active center. The catalytic properties of the hy- bridized centers depend on the nature of the precursor com- ponents as well as the interaction between the two components. (2) The stronger the acidity of the support, the higher the cracking activity, and the lower the isomerization selectivity. However, by hybridizing the acidity of the support with the electronic action of the metal component, the hydrogenation activity will be strengthened, whilst the cracking activity will be weakened, and this hybridizing effect will in turn enhance the isomerization activity of the catalyst [3â€“5]. These hybridizing effects can be illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. By means of these guidelines, Lin and co-workers [6] have succeeded in the development of a hydroisomerization catalyst comprising W, Mo, and Ni supported on fluorinated alumina in a rather short period of time, which could catalyze straight-run paraffinic kerosines from Daqing fractions to jet fuels of low freezing points (< â€“ 60 ÂºC) with high yields under medium pressures (Table 1). The catalyst was scaled up to a commercial scale, and completed a long-term operation in a pilot plant of 40 L catalyst loading in 1964. At the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, the demand for high octane-rating gasolines increased rapidly, Table 1 Comparison of hydroisomerization performance of different catalysts Operating conditions Product data Freezing point (oC) Catalyst p/MPa t/oC H2/oil (v/v) LHSV (hâ€“1) > 130 oC fraction 180â€“240 oC fraction Yield (< 180 oC fraction, %) Content of wax (> 180 oC fraction, %) Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 3 425 1000 0.9 28 41 51 Ni/Al2O3-F 3 430 1000 0.5 21 13 46 Pt/Al2O3-F 3 425 1000 0.5 39 45 24 29 Pt/Al2O3 3 420 1000 0.5 30 11 30 Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 3 420 1000 0.5 46 43 35 Mo-W-Ni/Al2O3-F 4 420 1000 0.5 62 60 24 13 Feedstock: Daqing straight-run kerosene, distillation range = 200â€“290 oC, freezing point = 20 oC, content of wax > 40%.

TIAN Zhijian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 705â€“710 especially in the United States, so that big petroleum refining companies world wide were putting great efforts to develop technologies for hydrocracking of heavy oils to high quality light fuels. Among them, the Standard Oil Co. of California (the later Chevron Co.) was the first one to announce its suc- cessful commercialization of the Isocracking Process in 1959 [7]. Meanwhile, basic research on the catalysis of hydroisom- erization and hydrocracking has been progressing to a rela- tively mature stage. In 1956, Weisz [8,9] defined the concept of bifunctional catalysis. In 1964, Coonradt and Garwood [10] proposed the classical mechanism of hydrocarbon hydroisom- erization and hydrocracking: both the activation of normal alkanes and hydrogenation of the double bonds of iso-olefins have to occur on metallic sites of the catalyst, whilst the for- mation of the intermediate carbonium ions as well as the isomerization and rupturing of the Câ€“C bonds during the reac- tion are to proceed on acidic sites. Besides, the rupturing of the carbonium ions follows the È•-scission mechanism. In that period of time, international exchanges were rather lacking in China; however, the researchers of DICP developed their hydrocarbon conversion catalysts and processing tech- nologies with the similar trend of the western countries. The distinctive features of this team at that time were more con- centrated on the metal-acidic interaction rather than the bi- functional mechanism of reaction. In the 1960s, western countries were focusing on the production of gasoline from heavy oils as their main goal, so that they were stressing high cracking activities of the catalysts for obtaining maximal yields of light fuels. On the other hand, the DICP trend of catalyst development was aimed mainly at the manufacturing of low-freezing middle distillates. Therefore, besides high cata- lytic activities, DICP researchers were pursuing especially high isomerization selectivities of the catalysts. Owing to this dif- fered objective with the western researchers, the DICP inves- tigators have paid great attention all along on enhancing the isomerization selectivities of the catalysts, which has become one of the research features of DICP in the R&D of hydro- carbon conversion catalysts. The bifunctional mechanism proposed by Coonradt and Garwood [10] mainly describes the conversion mechanism of saturated hydrocarbons, with emphasis on the dual functions of the metallic component and the acidic component of the cata- lysts. On the other hand, the hybridization rules of electronic and acidic interaction for hydrocarbon conversion proposed by Lin and co-workers, as has been mentioned above, are ex- ploring the origins of the isomerizing-cracking selectivity of the catalyst and stressing the effect of the interaction between the metal and the acidic components on the selectivity of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the chemical natures of the two theories are identical, and similar concepts for the design of hydro- cracking-hydroisomerization catalysts can be obtained from both of the two models. 2 R&D of the 219 Type catalysts for hydrocracking of vacuum gas oils and its commercialization Lin, Zhang, and co-workers, by applying again the hy- bridization rules of electronic and acidic interaction as the guiding principles, developed successfully a highly active hydroisomerization catalyst by combining a highly efficient hydrogenation component with a weakly acidic support. The catalyst was then employed in the processing of hydrotreated Daqing waxy VGOs to produce isomerized feedstocks for a subsequent hydrocracking reaction unit to yield low-freezing middle distillates. In 1963, on the basis of this catalyst, and entrusted by the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum Industry, DICP researchers commenced the research project of â€œproduction of jet fuels via isocracking of Daqing heavy oilsâ€�. A novel catalyst system comprised of W and Ni as the metallic components and a proprietary amorphous alumino-silicate support with large pore and mild acidity was developed by Lin, Zhang, Xiao, and Li, and was designated as the 219 Type catalyst. Furthermore, by analyzing the specific features of the Daqing heavy oils, a new catalyst-bed configuration was employed for the first time in the petroleum refining industry, namely, two catalysts with slightly different performance properties were loaded into a single reactor, the upper part of the reactor was filled with a 219A Type catalyst, which had a higher hydrogenation activity, while the lower part of the reactor was loaded with a 219B Type catalyst, which had a better isomerization activity. In this way, the poisonous N-containing feeds were hydrodenitro- genated more efficiently in the upper bed of the catalysts, thus creating cleaner reactants for enhancing the hydrocracking conversion of the process. With this 219 Type catalysts and the renovated catalyst-bed configuration, high quality and low-freezing middle distillate products were yielded under a pressure of 15 MPa. The 219 Type catalysts and the new catalyst-bed configura- tion were then enlarged to a bench scale test with a 2 liter reactor volume, and the scaling up experiment was a complete success. A semi-demo plant was then arranged for a pre-commercialization examination of the 219 Type catalysts and the reactor performance. The 219 Type catalysts were put into commercial scale production at the No. 3 Petroleum Plant in Fushun City of Liaoning Province, and the commercial designation of this catalyst system was the â€œ3652 Catalystâ€�. Approximately 1.5 m3 of the commercially produced 3652 Catalyst were loaded into a semi-industrial reactor to carry out a demo performance. The demo operation of the 3652 Catalyst again proved to be fully satisfactory, and a commercial hy- drocracking unit of 400 kt/a, the first one in China, was con- structed in the Daqing Refinery on the basis of the DICP results and was put into full operation at the end of 1966. The com- mercial unit in Daqing produced high quality jet fuels and low-freezing diesel fractions with excellent reproduction of the DICP laboratory results. It can be seen from Table 2 that over TIAN Zhijian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 705â€“710 the 219 Type catalysts developed by DICP, the commercial unit could produce low-freezing jet fuels (freezing point < 60 ÂºC) as well as diesels (freezing point 35 ÂºC) with high yields from Daqing vacuum wax oils. Subsequently, the same catalyst and technology were utilized in production units at the No. 3 Pe- troleum Plant and the Yanshan Petrochemical Co. in Beijing. It is worth to point out that with the successful development of the DICP hydrocracking catalysts and technology, China be- came one of the earliest countries that were capable of handling the sophisticated and advanced hydrocracking technology in the world [11]. Moreover, in the 1960s, most western refining companies employed two-staged hydrocracking reactor systems in order to obtain high octane-rating gasolines, while China was the exceptional one to use the single-staged reactor system with a two catalyst-bed configuration for hydrocracking performance. It was only from the beginning of the 1970s that the western countries also adopted similar single-staged reactors of two-bed configuration for hydrocracking operations. 3 R&D of isodewaxing catalysts for lubrication base-oils and their commercialization Not long after the development of the hydrocracking cata- lysts supported on amorphous acidic solids, the development of new generations of hydrocracking catalysts using acidic crys- talline zeolites to substitute the amorphous supports has also been started. It was found that the hydrocracking catalysts supported on Y type zeolites exhibited higher activities and better selectivities for light fuel fractions than the amorphous supported ones. In the 1970s, based on the shape-selective cracking properties of the ZSM-5 zeolites towards normal alkanes, the Mobil Co. of the United States commercialized catalytic dewaxing catalysts and technologies for middle dis- tillates (MDDW) and lubrication base oils (MLDW) [12]. In the 1990s, the Chevron Co. commercialized isodewaxing catalysts comprising of noble metals supported on SAPO-11 zeolites (Isodewaxing) [13]. Meanwhile, Mobil Co. also put forward new generations of zeolite-supported noble metal catalysts for isodewaxing of middle distillates (MIDW) and lubrication base oils (MSDW) [12]. The application of zeolites in catalyst systems has given renewed impetus to the basic studies on mechanisms of cata- lytic hydrocracking and hydroisomerization. According to the classical bifunctional mechanism mentioned above, it is pos- sible to regulate the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization selectivities of an amorphous acidic solid-supported bifunc- tional catalyst by monitoring an adequate balance of the me- tallic and acidic properties. On the other hand, for a zeo- lite-supported catalyst, the catalytic properties are also affected by the shape selectivity features of the zeolite support. For example, with the ZSM-5 zeolite, the pores with 10-membered ring openings will allow the entering of normal alkanes but will hinder the access of branched alkanes (reactant shape selec- tivity). As a result, this kind of zeolites will crack normal al- kanes selectively, with the retention of the iso-alkanes. Alter- natively, zeolites with 10-membered ring pores of one-di- mensional straight channels, such as SAPO-11 and ZSM-22, can hinder the formation of multi-substituted carbonium ions via the space constraint effect, and this in turn will retard the occurrence of the cracking reaction (transition-state shape selectivity, or pore mouth and keyâ€“lock selectivity) [14,15]. Thus, by using these zeolites as the supports, and at the same time by incorporating noble metal components to enhance the hydrogenation activities, it is possible to develop isodewaxing catalysts especially suited for treating high wax content feeds to produce low pour point and high viscosity index (VI) base oils. At the end of last decade, the DICP research team of Tian and coworkers, in collaboration with PetroChina, has com- menced the R&D of zeolite-supported noble metal catalysts for hydroisodewaxing of lubrication base oils. On the basis of the traditional model of bifunctional catalysts, they proposed a new bi-tetrahedron model (Fig. 2), which has proved to be a practical guide for the design of hydroisodewaxing catalysts. In conformity with this model, and by combining certain 10-membered ring opening and one-dimensional straight channel zeolites with appropriate metal components, they have investigated systematically the effects of synthesizing condi- tions of zeolites, chemical modification of micro-pores of zeolites, doping atoms, and modification of acidity on the hydroisomerization properties of the catalysts [16â€“20]. Through these investigations, they have succeeded in the syn- thesis of highly active AEL type zeolites under alcohol-thermal conditions [16,17]. They also found that via silanization of the SAPO-11 zeolite, it was possible to reduce the acidic sites on Table 2 Typical performance data of 219 Type hydroconversion catalysts for maximum middle distillates Operating conditions Yieldsb (%) Catalyst p/MPa t/oC H2/oil (v/v) LHSV (hâ€“1) Conversion (%) H2 consumption (N M3/t) Gasoline Kerosene (freezing point < â€“60 oC) Diesel 219 14.4 420 2000 0.92 66 226 18.5 51.2 27.1 A referencea 18.0 415 2100 0.77 60 339 32.7 43.1 21.6 aA hydrocracking catalyst imported from abroad in 1980. bSingle stage with recycle.

These modifications were favorable for enhancing the selec- tivity towards mono-branched isomers [18]. Meanwhile, they have prepared a new Pt/MgAPO-11 catalyst having high ac- tivity and selectivity for hydroisodewaxing [19]. With progresses made in applied investigations, mechanistic studies on the synthesis of zeolites were also strengthened in this research team [21â€“25]. By means of the newly rising ap- proach of ionothermal synthesis [26,27], they have studied the templating action during the synthesis of zeolites [21] and have found for the first time concrete evidence showing that water molecules play a key role in the synthesis of zeolites [23]. A new method for the synthesis of zeolites via microwave iono- thermal actions has also been developed [24]. Great contributions of this research team could be repre- sented by their successful development of a hydroisomeriza- tion catalyst for the processing of Daqing vacuum gas oils and a hydroisodewaxing catalyst for the treating of Kelamayi light deasphalt oils. The PIC802 catalyst developed by this team, which was scaled up from the laboratory reactor of a few milliliters to a pilot plant reactor of several liters, has been operated success- fully for a long duration of 8 000 h. Furthermore, preparation of the zeolite for the catalyst support was undertaken in large scale with a 5 m3 commercial autoclave. Another catalyst developed by them, the WICON802 cata- lyst, was also put into pilot plant tests for hydroisodewaxing of Kelamayi light deasphalt oils, and the results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that over this catalyst, high yields of low pour point 150 BS bright stocks with viscosity index greater than 80 could be obtained. The PIC802 catalyst was then commercialized and em- ployed in a high pressure hydrogenation unit of 200 kt/a in the Daqing Refining & Chemical Co. of PetroChina. Performance data (Table 4) indicated that when processing pre-hydrogenated 200SN light dewaxing oils and 650SN furfural refining oils, high yields of low pour point medium base oil (with viscosity Table 3 Typical performance data of hydroisomerization of Ke- lamayi light deasphalt oil on WICON802 catalyst Feedstock light deasphalt oil from Kelamayi naphthene base crude vacuum residue Distillation (ÂºC) 5% 431 50% 571 95% 706 Density (20 ÂºC, g/cm3) 0.923 Pour point (ÂºC) 5 Kinematic viscosity (100 ÂºC, mm2/s) 69.5 Operating conditions Pressure (MPa) 16 Temperature (ÂºC) 340 H2/oil (v/v) 800 LHSV (hâ€“1) 0.8 150BS product data Distillation (ÂºC) > 460 Yield (%) 67.30 Pour point (ÂºC) 19 Kinematic viscosity (100 ÂºC, mm2/s) 31.79 Viscosity index (VI) 85 Table 4 Typical performance data of the Daqing 200 kt/a base oil Isodewaxing Unit using the PIC802 catalyst Feedstock 200SN light dewaxing oil 650SN furfural refining oil Distillation (ÂºC) 5% 409.9 475.4 50% 461.1 516.2 95% 504.4 556.1 Density (20 ÂºC, g/cm3) 0.8788 0.8678 Pour point (ÂºC) 0 > 60 Kinematic viscosity (100 ÂºC, mm2/s) 6.645 10.59 Operating conditions Pressure (MPa) 13.6 13.6 Temperature (ÂºC) 320 350 H2/oil (v/v) 600 900 LHSV (hâ€“1) 0.82 0.7 Base oil data middle distillation Heavy distillation Distillation (ÂºC) >400 >420 Yield (%) 80 72 Pour point (ÂºC) 21 18 Kinematic viscosity (100 ÂºC, mm2/s) 6.50 10.03 Viscosity index (VI) 105 128 Acidity Metal Shape selectivity Catalyst Active (yield) Selectivity (pour point) Selectivity (viscosity index) Acidity Catalyst Active (yield) Metal Selectivity (pour point) (a) (b) Fig. 2.

This progress signified a new breakthrough in the production of high quality lubrication base oil in China. 4 Conclusions and prospect With continuing efforts of several generations of researchers for 60 years, DICP has established an intact research system of applied catalysis, which has the feature of â€œpushing basic re- search forward by practical tasksâ€� and â€œpaying equal attention to both basic and applied studiesâ€�. DICP researchers have played important roles in promoting the technological progress of petroleum refining and petrochemical industry of our coun- try in its various developing stages. With the coming of the new century, the rapid development in our countryâ€™s national economy stimulates a greater demand for the supply of jet fuels and middle distillates. Meanwhile, with the posing of more and more stringent regulations on environmental protection as well as on quality control, the Chinese government requires that increment in the production of high quality middle distillates should be fulfilled only by pursuing measures to enhance technological advances. The hydroisomerization/hydrocracking technologies have the advantages of high yields in middle distillates, high quality in products, and flexibility in produc- tion. Accordingly, these technologies will be one of the chief developing orientations in the refinery industry of our country. Lubrication oils are one of the main petroleum products and play an unsubstitutable role in the saving of energies. With the developments in wind-energy, energy-saving automobiles, and spacecrafts, more severe requirements for viscosity- tempera- ture properties of lubrication oils will be put forth. Then, hy- droisodewaxing will be the best choice to fulfill these re- quirements. DICP is in the course of preparation for the construction of the Dalian National Laboratory for Clean Energy, and clean technologies for fossil fuel processing will be one of the main research orientations in this newly established national labo- ratory. It is confident that facing the new challenges and op- portunities, DICP researchers will do their best to make new contributions for the advancement of Chinaâ€™s petroleum re- finery industry.

Tel/Fax: +86-411-84379151 The research and development of catalysts and catalytic processes for hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of petroleum feedstocks in Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) are described. In the 1960s, on the basis of extensive investigations, DICP researchers summarized a series of rules for governing the preparation of hydroisomerization and hydrocracking catalysts. By utilizing these rules as guidelines, DICP investigators have developed hydrocracking catalysts suitable for use in a single-stage process of vacuum gas oil hydrocracking. The catalysts as well as the process were then commercialized successfully in the first hydrocracking unit of China, which was constructed in Daqing Refinery with a capacity of 400 kt/a in 1967. Starting from 2000, DICP investigators have developed new generations of zeolite-based hydroisomerization catalysts, which were deployed in the 200 kt/a isodewaxing unit of Daqing Refining and Chemical Co. for base-oil feedstocks in 2008.
