Trifir6* Dipartimento di Chimiea Industriale e dei Materiali Viale Risorgimento 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy Abstract The surface properties of the V-P-O-based catalysts are discussed referring to their reactivity towards different organic substrates. Various saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons were fed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the results were discussed in terms of the main surface characteristics of the active component, the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P207. The combination of acid and oxygen-insertion properties of the vanadyl pyrophosphate makes several contemporaneous reactions possible, and the final products distribution is a function of (i) the reaction conditions, which also affect the average oxidation state of vanadium, (ii) the extent of the interaction between the hydrocarbon and the surface, and (iii) the tendency of the activated hydrocarbon to undergo acid-catalysed transformations rather than oxidative ones. Keywords: Vanadyl pyrophosphate; Vanadium phosphorus mixed oxides; Alkane oxidation; Maleic anhydride synthesis; Phtalic anhydride synthesis; Surface properties 1. Introduction The vanadium-phosphorus mixed oxide is the oxidation catalyst for the indus- trial transformation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [ 1 ]. Fixed-bed, moving-bed and fluidized-bed catalysts all present the same type of active phase, the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2OT, and no other catalytic compositions have been pro- posed. The same phase has been reported to be an efficient catalyst for the oxyfunctionalization of light paraffins: (i) for the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid [2-4], (ii) for the oxidation and ammoxidation of propane to acrylic acid [5] and acrylonitrile [6,7], respectively, and (iii) for the oxidation of n-pentane to maleic and phthalic anhydrides [8-13]. This system has been extensively studied in the * Corresponding author. Fax: +39 51 6443680; e-mail: trifiro@ms.fci.unibo.it 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00052-5 196 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 last 10--15 years; the results have been analysed in several reviews [ 1,14-16] and in a special issue of Catalysis Today [17]. It has been proposed in previous papers that in order to fulfil the requirements which are needed for the multi-electron oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, the catalyst must present a large spectrum of active sites able to operate different oxidative attacks [18,19]. Moreover, an important role is played by the surface acidity of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, which was recognized to be fundamental in the activation of the C-H bond in the paraffin, and in favouring the desorption of acid products, thus avoiding undesired consecutive reactions [14]. Starting from the discovery of the catalytic properties of the V-P-O system, the surface features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate have been characterized by several different spectroscopic and transient techniques, aimed at the study of the interaction between specific probe molecules and the active centres [ 14,15]. These techniques include FT-IR spectroscopy and TPD of adsorbed probe molecules, and the TAP reactor [20]. All these in situ techniques have yielded many information about the nature of active sites. The characterization can be completed by studying the reactivity of these sites. We have, therefore, begun a program of screening of the catalytic behaviour of V-P-O-based catalysts in different classes of reactions, with the following aims: (1) To rationalize the network of reactions which can occur in the oxidative functionalization of hydrocarbons over V-P-O-based catalysts. (2) To titrate and identify the active sites through a study of the oxidation of different organic substrates. In this way it is possible to single out the reactivity of the surface by the use of a technique which is both in situ and dynamic, and capable to give both mechanistic and kinetic information. (3) To understand the key properties of V-P-O-based catalysts in determining the catalytic behaviour by comparison with other vanadium oxide-based catalysts. (4) To study the mechanism of synthesis of phthalic anhydride from n-pentane, which requires a catalyst with both oxidizing and acid properties. (5) To verify the possibility of new ways of utilization of paraffins and/or of alternative applications of this catalyst, such as the direct synthesis of phthalic anhydride, acids, aldehydes and ketones. In this paper we report and discuss the results concerning the oxidation of (i) C2-C8 paraffins, (ii) C5-C8 cycloparaffins, (iii) C4-C5 olefins and (iv) C6-C8 (alkyl)aromatic compounds. The results obtained in the anaerobic transformation of C4-C5 paraffins and olefins are also reported. 2. Experimental V-P-O-based catalysts were prepared by the organic procedure; V205 was suspended in isobutanol and H3PO4 (at the desired P/V ratio), and heated at reflux for some hours. The solid obtained was filtered, dried, and calcined in nitrogen flow E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 197 at temperatures higher than 450 for 6 h at least. The material obtained was then sized to particles of 0.3-0.5 mm in diameter, and loaded in a stainless steel flow reactor for catalytic tests. The fresh catalyst will be referred to as a non- equilibrated one. After approximately 500 h reaction in n-butane oxidation the same catalyst is referred to as an equilibrated one. Details concerning the apparatus for catalytic tests have been reported in a previous paper [11]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The oxyfunctionalization of light alkanes on vanadyl pyrophosphate V-P-O systems have been reported to be efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of C2-C5 alkanes, but have been successfully applied at commercial level only for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. Table 1 reports the maximum yield to the oxygenated products from each paraffin over V-P-O-based catalysts. It is worth mentioning that in all cases the catalyst is mainly constituted of vanadyl pyrophosphate, which however may contain either metal dopants or other vanadium phosphates. The selectivity to the product of partial oxidation is a function of the reactant nature; from n-butane and n-pentane the selectivity to maleic anhydride and to maleic+phthalic anhydrides, respec- tively, is relatively high, while from ethane the prevailing products obtained are either ethylene or carbon oxides (depending on the reaction conditions); acetic acid is formed in rather low amounts. From propane very low amounts of acrylic acid are formed, and carbon oxides prevail. These differences can be attributed to the possibility of formation of very stable products (the anhydrides) from C4 and from C5 paraffins, while acrylic acid (from propane) undergoes consecutive reactions of oxidative degradation. This is also demonstrated by the fact that a higher selectivity can be obtained from propane in the presence of ammonia, because acrylonitrile is a much more stable compound Table 1 Maximum yields to the desired products in the oxidation of light alkanes Reactant Catalyst comp.

Finally, the low selectivity to acetic acid from ethane has to be attributed to the low specificity of the active sites in this reaction, rather than to the instability of the product, since acetic acid can be regarded as a stable compound. In the case of ethane oxidation, by-products are carbon oxides, ethylene and acetaldehyde; in propane oxidation by-products are carbon oxides, propylene, acetic acid and acrolein, while in propane ammoxidation by-products are carbon oxides, propylene, acetonitrile and cyanidric acid. On the contrary, one main characteristic of n-butane oxidation (but the same considerations apply to the oxidation of n-pentane) is the substantial absence of by-products of partial oxidation other than maleic anhydride (apart from a low amount of phthalic anhydride). This constitutes an obvious advantage for the industrial exploitation of this reaction; on the other hand, the absence of by-products does not allow to obtain information on the reaction mechanism. It has been proposed that the transformation of n-butane to maleic anhydride involves the following steps at the adsorbed state [1,14]: 1. 2. 3. 4. 4t\" 5t\" n-butane+l/2 O2--*butenes+H20 (oxidative dehydrogenation), butenes+l/2 O2~butadiene+H20 (allylic H-abstraction), butadiene+l/2 O2-+2,5-dihydrofuran (1,4 oxygen-insertion), 2,5-dihydrofuran+2 O2---~maleic anhydride+2 H20 (allylic O-insertion, possibly via lactone) or, 2,5-dihydrofuran+l/2 O2---ffuran+H20 (allylic H-abstraction), furan+3/2 O2---~maleic anhydride+H20 (electrophilic oxygen-insertion). The absence of any of the proposed intermediates amongst the products under usual reaction conditions can be ascribed to their reactivity, which is higher than that of n-butane. In other words, they are readily converted in the adsorbed state up to the final product before they can desorb in the gas phase. This mechanism has received indirect confirmation through the isolation of some of the reaction intermediates, even though this could be achieved only under rather unusual conditions [22,23]. In general, olefin-like intermediates are thought to be the first intermediates in the reactions involving transformations of C3-C5 alkanes to the corresponding oxygenated compounds [23]. These intermediates have been isolated only at high hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratios and at very low residence times in the case of n-butane and n-pentane oxidation, but are always observed in the case of propane (amm)oxidation [6,7]. It is also possible to favour the formation of propylene (with selectivity higher than 50%) with respect to carbon oxides and acrylic acid by operating at high propane-to-oxygen ratio in feed [24]. In ethane oxidation, instead, ethylene and acetic acid are formed through parallel, independent ways. 100 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 02 cony., selectivity, % iC4 conv., % 199 12 80 60 40 20 10 8 -6 -4 -2 j ox JJ~ : nv ~ acr. acid .~ ~ sel. iC4= \"~ sel. acet.acid ~ v v sel. methacrolein- ~ v 390 O' 0 350 360 370 380 400 410 temperature, *C Fig. 1.

Reaction conditions: residence time 3.6 s, feedstock composition 26 mol% isobutane, 13% 02, 12% H20, rest He. The reaction pattern proposed evidences the need for different kinds of active sites on the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, able to perform with great selectivity each step in the reaction pathway. 3.2. The oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein and methacrylic acid, and the role of the oxidation state of vanadium Very few data are available about the use of V-P-O-based catalysts for the oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein and methacrylic acid [21]. Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst might seem to be a reasonable choice, since this reaction has several points in common with n-butane transformation to maleic anhydride, at least from a formal point of view. However, one main difference concerns the nature of the product; in fact methacrolein and methacrylic acid are much less stable compounds than maleic anhydride, and easily undergo consecutive degra- dation reactions to carbon oxides and to acetic acid [15,25-27]. As shown in Fig. 1 (which reports the isobutane and oxygen conversions as well as the selectivity to the various products as functions of the reaction temperature) the overall selectivity to methacrolein and methacrylic acid is always lower than 40%, and the best selectivity is obtained only for very low isobutane conversion. The data were obtained with a well-crystallized vanadyl pyrophosphate (equilibrated catalyst). 200 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 Conditions used (given in the caption) were those typically employed in the oxidation of isobutane over heteropolycompound-based catalysts, that is very high hydrocarbon concentration (fuel-rich conditions); therefore oxygen was the limit- ing reactant. With respect to data given in literature for the oxidation of isobutane over heteropolycompounds [28,29], the vanadyl pyrophosphate is remarkably less active; in fact comparable conversions of isobutane are achieved at a temperature which is at least 50 higher than that with heteropolycompounds. Since the products are rather unstable, and suffer from reaction temperatures higher than 380, at these conditions the selectivity to the desired products drops to 10-15% at 9% isobutane conversion (T-400). With heteropolycompounds, instead, operation can be carried out at temperatures lower than 380, and the selectivity can be maintained close to 50% even at 10-12% isobutane conversion [25-27]. Therefore, these results suggest that vanadyl pyrophosphate might be a good catalyst for this reaction, provided its activity could be increased so to allow operation to be carried out at lower temperatures. The figure shows that isobutene was produced only for very high oxygen conversion (at temperatures higher than 370); this indicates that the olefin possibly is the reaction intermediate, and that in the absence of molecular oxygen the transformation of isobutene to methacrolein and methacrylic acid is hindered. When the same catalytic tests were carried out loading an oxidized V-P-O catalyst (a sample containing mainly vVoPo4 phases and only a small fraction of vanadyl pyrophosphate), results similar to those displayed in Fig. 1 were obtained under stationary conditions (i.e., after approximately 100 h time-on-stream). On the contrary, we expected a lower selectivity to methacrylic acid than with vanadyl pyrophosphate, in analogy with what occurs in the oxidation of n-butane; in fact, in the latter case the selectivity to maleic anhydride is greatly affected by the oxidation state of vanadium [1,14,15,30-32]. However, the characterization of the catalyst after reaction revealed that under these operative conditions (high isobutane-to-oxygen ratio in feedstock) the vanadium at the catalyst surface was mainly in the IV oxidation state. Therefore, a reduction of the surface vanadium ions from the original average oxidation state close to V to a state close to IV had occurred in the reaction environment, until a steady performance and a corre- sponding stable vanadium state was reached. This may explain the similar catalytic performance of the two samples examined. When instead isobutane-lean conditions were used (1.5% isobutane in air, analogously to what is done in the industrial process for maleic anhydride production from n-butane in traditional co-feeding flow reactors), higher selectiv- ities to methacrolein and methacrylic acid were obtained with the vanadyl pyrophosphate than with the oxidized vV-p-O system. In fact, since these conditions are much less reductant than the isobutane-rich conditions, the oxidized V-P-O catalyst maintained its original oxidation degree in the reaction environ- E Cavani, E TrifirO/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 201 ment, yielding a less selective catalyst. This confirms the important role of the oxidation state of vanadium. Many papers have been published in literature describing the role of the oxidation state of vanadium in V-P-O-based catalysts in affecting the catalytic performance in Ca oxidation [15,30-34]. In general, it is accepted that a certain amount of oxidized vanadium sites is necessary to achieve good yields to maleic anhydride, but that an high concentration of Vv sites is responsible for the consecutive oxidative degradation of the product to carbon oxides. This effect has been described in detail for the oxidation of butene and butadiene [19,34]. It was reported that the distribution of the products is greatly affected by the reaction conditions; the latter also modify the nature of surface vanadium species. In the case of 1-butene oxidation, the main products obtained are (i) butadiene below 300, (ii) maleic anhydride (together with other oxygenated products, such as furan and methylvinylketone, obtained from the allylic oxidation of the olefin, and acetic acid from the oxidative cleavage of C-C bond) at intermediate temperatures, and (iii) carbon oxides above 350. In correspon- dence, the analysis of the catalyst revealed that the average oxidation degree of vanadium increased on increasing the reaction temperature; at the highest tem- perature, the average oxidation state of vanadium at the catalyst surface was higher than IV, which indicated that a considerable fraction of vanadium was in the oxidation state V. The data reported here indicate that the average oxidation state of vanadium in the vanadyl pyrophosphate also affects the selectivity to the products in the oxidation of isobutane. The differences between catalysts of different vanadium oxidation state become minimal when the reaction is carried out under very reducing conditions, since a great fraction of the original Vv in oxidized catalysts is reduced to VTM species. The same is known to occur in the DuPont process for the oxidation of n-butane, where the paraffin and the oxygen are fed separately to perform the oxidation of n- butane and the reoxidation of the catalyst in separate vessels; therefore, the catalyst operates under very reducing conditions. The claimed selectivity to maleic anhydride in this case is remarkably higher than for the traditional co-feeding process [35]. Furthermore, the oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid has the following points in common with the oxidation of n-butane: (1) The best catalytic systems described in literature for these reactions, heteropolycompounds and vanadyl pyrophosphate, both exhibit a structure which couples acid and oxidizing properties; therefore they possess intrinsic multi- functional properties, which are fundamental features a catalyst must have to catalyse the oxidative transformation of alkanes with good selectivity. It is not surprising that heteropolycompounds and vanadyl pyrophosphate are the systems which are most studied for the oxyfunctionalization of more reactive (C_>2) paraffins to oxygenated compounds [ 15]. 202 F. Cavani, F. Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 (2) The olefin is the first intermediate of the reaction, but it can only be isolated in conditions of oxygen deficit. Differences with the oxidation of n-butane are: (1) In the oxidation of isobutane the intermediate olefin cannot be further oxydehydrogenated to the diolefin. The mechanism, therefore, is different from that of n-butane, and involves allylic O-insertion on intermediate isobutene, in the same way as it occurs in the oxidation of propane. This is also a mechanism which occurs when 1-butene is oxidized on vanadyl pyrophosphate, yielding several by- products like unsaturated aldehydes and acids. (2) From the mechanistic point of view, the oxidation of n-butane is a more demanding reaction than the oxidation of isobutane, since a more complex array of adjacent active sites, each one with a specific property, is necessary to reach the final product. The vanadyl pyrophosphate structure may accomplish these require- ments, which on the other hand are not fundamental for the synthesis of methacrylic acid from isobutane. (3) Since the products of isobutane partial oxidation, methacrolein and methacrylic acid, are less stable than maleic anhydride, the control of the reaction conditions (especially temperature) is much more important than in the case of n-butane oxidation. 3.3. The oxidation of Cs--Cs n-alkanes and cycloalkanes The formation of phthalic anhydride with good selectivity in the oxidation of n- pentane clearly indicates a reaction pathway including a step of dimerization occurring upon some reactive intermediate [8-13]. In addition, it suggests the possibility of other oxidative transformations starting from higher n-paraffins. However, the oxidation of n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane only yields traces of phthalic anhydride (Table 2); in fact carbon oxides, maleic anhydride and light hydrocarbons (arising from cracking reactions) are the prevailing products [24]. Since a very low selectivity to phthalic anhydride (less than 1%) is also obtained from n-butane, these data indicate a specificity of the vanadyl pyrophosphate in the transformation of a C5 intermediate to phthalic anhydride (or to a precursor of phthalic anhydride). It is worth mentioning that the oxidation of n-pentane on other vanadium oxide-based catalysts either yields olefins and diolefins (on Mg-V-O) [36] or maleic anhydride (V205/SIO2) [37], besides carbon oxides.

Reaction conditions: residence time 1.6 s, feedstock composition 0.7 mol% hydrocarbon in air. The oxidation of C5-C8 cycloalkanes was also studied. For example, Fig. 2 compares the overall selectivity to maleic+phthalic anhydrides and the maleic-to- phthalic anhydrides selectivities ratio as a function of the reaction temperature for the oxidation of cyclopentane and of n-pentane. Cyclopentane was remarkably more reactive than n-pentane; total conversion was achieved already at 330, while n-pentane was completely converted at 370. This higher reactivity allows operation to be carded out at milder conditions, and therefore leads to an higher overall selectivity (and hence higher yields) to the anhydrides than those obtained from n-pentane. Phthalic anhydride was the prevailing product at low conversion; on increasing the temperature, a maximum in the yield of phthalic anhydride was obtained, while the yield of maleic anhydride was progressively increased up to total reactant conversion. As a consequence, with both hydrocarbons the ratio between the maleic anhydride selectivity and the phthalic anhydride selectivity increased on increasing the reaction temperature. The analogies between cyclopentane and n-pentane suggest the possibility of a cyclic intermediate in the transformation of n-pentane to phthalic anhydride. Therefore, one possible pathway might involve a Cs cyclic (cyclopentene or cyclopentadiene) intermediate, which is then dimerized (through a sort of \"tem- plate addition\") to a bicyclo C10 compound; the latter is finally oxydehydroge- nated, decarboxylated and oxidized to phthalic anhydride (Scheme l(a)) [8,38]. 204 E Cavani, F.

Mechanisms proposed in the literature for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride in n-pentane oxidation over vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst: via \"template addition\" of two cyclopentadiene molecules (a) and via acid-catalysed dimerization of two pentadiene molecules to decaline (b). The need for a cyclic intermediate might explain the very low amount of phthalic anhydride from n-butane. Also in the case of C6 and C7 cycloolefins (formed by oxydehydrogenation of the corresponding n-paraffins and cyclization of the olefins or diolefins), analogous dimerization mechanisms can occur. In these cases, however, the formation of a phthalic anhydride precursor can be hypothesized with more difficulty than with the Cs hydrocarbon. Alternatively, it is known that in the presence of acid centres cyclopentene is rapidly transformed to decaline [39]; the latter may be the precursor of naphtha- lene, which might be finally converted to phthalic anhydride (Scheme l(b)) [18,38]. In fact, the direct oxidation of decaline yielded tetraline, naphthalene, naphthoquinone and phthalic anhydride, besides carbon oxides, in a consecutive stepwise scheme. Naphthalene and naphthoquinone were not reactive intermedi- ates; in fact they could not be completely transformed to phthalic anhydride for all conditions of temperature, residence time or reactants concentration [ 18,38]. Since on the contrary naphthalene and naphthoquinone have never been identified, not even in traces, amongst the reaction products when n-pentane is the reactant, it is possible to exclude the formation of decaline as the reaction intermediate in n-pentane oxidation.

The balance is made of carbon oxides. Other possible pathways involving the contribution of the acid centres and alternative mechanisms for the formation of phthalic anhydride will be discussed later. The results obtained in the oxidation of C>5 cycloalkanes are summarized in Table 3. A comparison with the results of Table 2 indicates that only for the C6 hydrocarbons the cycloparaffin is more reactive than the corresponding n-paraffin, due to the high velocity of cyclohexane aromatization. This means that once the cyclic compound is formed from n-hexane, it is soon oxydehydrogenated to benzene. However, the cyclization of n-hexane is a slow process, and other parallel reactions (oxidative attacks) may occur, leading to a different distribution of products than from cyclohexane. In fact, benzene is obtained in very low amounts from n-hexane (which mainly yields carbon oxides, small amounts of maleic anhydride and traces of phthalic anhydride), while benzene is obtained with high selectivity from cyclohexane up to total reactant conversion. For temperatures higher than 350 benzene is then converted to maleic anhydride with good selectivity. The oxidation of cycloheptane yields mainly carbon oxides, with small amounts of maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, toluene, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. The formation of these aromatic compounds is explained by hypothesizing an acid-catalysed skeletal isomerization of intermediate cyclohep- tene. Cyclooctane yields more phthalic anhydride than the other cycloparaffins, as it can be expected since the number of carbon atoms for the two compounds is the same. In this case the formation of the anhydride likely occurs via a multistep skeletal isomerization of intermediate cyclooctene to a dimethylcyclohexene, which is then oxydehydrogenated to o-xylene, precursor of phthalic anhydride. The non-negligible amount of C7 oxidation products (benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) indicates the contribution of the parallel reaction of cracking. Besides the 206 80 F.

In fact, an higher selectivity to phthalic anhydride is obtained from 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane than from cyclooctane, as shown in Fig. 3. The figure reports the effect of the W/F ratio on the reactant conversion and products distribution in the oxidation of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The cycloparaffin is readily converted to o-xylene (a primary product), which then undergoes consecutive oxidation to phthalic anhydride. The results obtained indicate significant differences between the n-paraffins and the corresponding cyclic compounds. In fact different products distribution are obtained from the two reactants, except in the case of C5 hydrocarbons (Fig. 2); the difference is particularly evident for the C6 hydrocarbons. This suggests that after the first steps of n-paraffin oxydehydrogenation to the olefin and diolefins, these intermediate compounds can undergo different parallel transformations: (i) cycli- zation, (ii) oxidation to unsaturated oxygenated compounds (amongst which is maleic anhydride), some of which are likely precursors of carbon oxides, (iii) other acid-catalysed transformations (i.e., dimerization). The relative rates of these reactions are a function of the nature of the reactant. When the rate of oxidation (or combustion) of the olefin/diolefin is higher than the rate of cyclization, the nature of the products obtained starting from the n-paraffin and from the cyclo- paraffin is different.

Possible reaction pathways for the formation of oxygenated by-products which have been identified (the latter are indicated by shaded areas) in 2-pentene and in pentadiene oxidation over an equilibrated vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst. 3.4. The oxidation of 2-pentene and 1,3-pentadiene Several products are obtained in the oxidation of 2-pentene and pentadiene; the two hydrocarbons give similar distributions of products. These reactions exhibit analogies as well differences with respect to the oxidation of n-pentane. The two unsaturated hydrocarbons are much more reactive than the paraffin, and thus can be efficiently oxidized at lower temperatures. Despite this, they are transformed to maleic and phthalic anhydrides with a remarkably lower selectivity than n-pentane; in fact the maximum overall selectivity to the two anhydrides is always lower than 20%. All the by-products which formed in the oxidation of 2-pentene have been indicated in Scheme 2, together with a possible pathway of formation. They have been classified in products with five and less than five carbon atoms, formed by reactions involving only one C5 molecule, and products with more than five carbon atoms, formed by reactions which involve two C5 molecules. Besides carbon oxides, pentadiene, cyclopentene and cyclopentadiene [40], main by-products which formed were acetic acid, acrylic acid, pentenone, 2H-pyran-2-one, citra- conic acid, cinnamaldehyde and 5-norbornene-endo-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. 208 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 Most compounds reported in Scheme 2 have also been isolated in n-pentane oxidation; however, in the latter case these by-products have been observed only at very low residence time and at high hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio, while from the unsaturated reactants they are obtained even at usual reaction conditions (i.e., residence time 1-3 s, feedstock composition 1% hydrocarbon in air) [ 12]. This also occurs from C4 hydrocarbons; in fact several by-products are formed when the unsaturated hydrocarbons (butenes and butadiene) are oxidized; these by-products lower the yield to maleic anhydride with respect to the paraffinic (n-butane) feedstock. The low amount of maleic and phthalic anhydrides from 2-pentene and from pentadiene is due to the strong interaction of these olefins with the catalyst surface; this interaction leads to a high extent of surface coverage, to a reduction of the vanadium centres, and thus to a scarce availability of nucleophilic oxygen- insertion sites, which are necessary to complete the reaction network up to the formation of the anhydrides. In other words, under these conditions the adsorbed intermediates do not find neighbouring oxygen-insertion sites, and easily undergo non-selective oxidative attacks by some electrophilic oxygen species [41]. The performance can be improved by increasing the oxygen concentration in feed, as shown in Fig. 4(a), which reports the 2-pentene conversion and the selectivity to the main products as functions of the oxygen content in feed. An increase in the oxygen concentration restores some of the surface selective oxygen-insertion sites, causing a slight increase in the formation of the anhydrides and a corresponding decrease in the selectivity to carbon oxides. On the other hand the oxygen concentration does not affect remarkably the formation of the other by-products (Fig. 4(b)), except for acrylic acid, the amount of which is strongly decreased on increasing oxygen concentration. In agreement with the hypothesis reported above, the distribution of products obtained from n-pentane becomes the same as that obtained from 2-pentene and pentadiene when the paraffin concentration in feed is very high (20 mol% n- pentane in air). This is shown in Fig. 5(a), which reports the yields to the products as functions of the residence time, at 340. Maleic and phthalic anhydrides are now obtained with low selectivity, because under these conditions the surface concentration of adsorbed intermediate olefin species (generated by oxydehydro- genation of the reactant) is high enough to lead to a low availability of oxygen- insertion sites. This is practically the same situation which occurs when the olefin is used as the reactant. The paraffin conversion is very low (less than 3%), and also in this case an increase in oxygen concentration improves the selectivity to phthalic and maleic anhydrides at the expense of carbon oxides. Fig. 5(b) shows the yields to the other main oxygenated by-products, which at these conditions are formed in amounts comparable to maleic and phthalic anhydrides. In fact the high concentration of adsorbed olefin species leads to the formation of many different compounds, which in other conditions would be either burnt or not formed at all. E Cavani, F.

E CavanL F Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 211 The similar nature of the products obtained from n-pentane (Fig. 5) and from 2-pentene (Fig. 4 and Scheme 2) confirms that an adsorbed olefin-like compound is the first intermediate in the oxidation of the paraffin. The adsorbed pentene is then quickly transformed to the diolefin, which constitutes the second intermediate species in the multistep oxidation of n-pentane. Maleic and phthalic anhydrides are formed through parallel ways from n-pentane, and both of them probably have the same intermediate, pentadiene. All the other by-products are formed by transfor- mation of adsorbed olefins or diolefins; some of them can also be intermediates in the synthesis of maleic anhydride or phthalic anhydride. The analysis of the by-products reported in Scheme 2 indicates that the diolefin may follow different pathways: 1. be oxidized to oxygenated compounds; 2. cyclize, and be oxidized to oxygenated compounds; 3. cyclize, dimerize (or, alternatively, first dimerize and then cyclize), undergo skeletal rearrangement, be oxydehydrogenated to the corresponding alkyl- aromatic, and be oxidized to oxygenated aromatic compounds. The evidence for the formation of alkylaromatics from pentene and from pentadiene suggests the possibility of an alternative pathway for the formation of phthalic anhydride from n-pentane, involving the decarboxylation and oxidation of an intermediate Clo aromatic compound (i.e., dimethylethylbenzene). 3.5. The oxidation of aromatics and alkylaromatics Table 4 reports the results obtained in the oxidation of benzene, toluene and o-xylene over vanadyl pyrophosphate. The conditions employed and the catalyst used are the same as those of Table 2. The oxidation of toluene results in the production of carbon oxides and low amounts of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. A comparison with the data of Table 3 indicates that the reactivity of toluene is similar to that of cycloheptane. Differ- ences concern the nature of the products: the aromatic does not yield maleic and phthalic anhydrides, and is more selective to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. The oxidation of o-xylene yields phthalic anhydride with high selectivity, and traces of phthalide, benzoic acid and o-tolualdehyde. The alkylaromatic is more reactive Table 4 Oxidation of aromatic compounds on vanadyl pyrophosphate (conditions and catalyst as in Tables 2 and 3) Reactant T () Conv.

The oxidation of benzene yields maleic anhydride with good selectivity. These data indicate that the vanadyl pyrophosphate can oxidize alkylaromatics to the corresponding aldehydes and acids. The low selectivity which is generally achieved is due to the high temperatures employed, which favour the decarb- oxylation and oxidative degradation of these unstable products. In fact, high selectivity can be obtained when two adjacent carboxyl groups form the very stable anhydride; this is what happens in the oxidation of o-xylene, which yields phthalic anhydride with high selectivity. 3.6. The acidity of the vanadyl pyrophosphate The presence of acid centres on the surface of vanadyl pyrophosphate justifies some of the reactions described here, such as the skeletal isomerization of cycloparaffins. It has been reported that the surface acidity of vanadyl pyropho- sphate is both Bronsted-type, arising from pendant P-OH groups, and Lewis-type, associated to Vrv ions [ 14,15,42]. In addition, vanadyl pyrophosphate was found to be active in the high-pressure alkylation of benzene with propylene [12]. The activity was less than one order of magnitude lower than that of silica-supported phosphoric acid, which is utilized commercially for this reaction. The distribution of products was also very similar for the two catalysts, and this suggests that the nature of the active acid sites for the alkylation is the same in both systems, likely associated to the free P-OH groups. In order to clarify the role which is played by surface acidity in the mechanism of phthalic anhydride formation from n-pentane, tests were made under anaerobic conditions by feeding the following reactants, diluted in helium: (i) n-pentane, (ii) 2-pentene, (iii) pentadiene, (iv) cyclopentene and (v) butadiene. The products obtained with each reactant are summarized in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that in all cases the yields to these products were very low (less than 2%); this may be due to the fact that under anaerobic conditions the catalyst exhibited a rapid Table 5 Anaerobic transformation of hydrocarbons on equilibrated vanadyl pyrophosphate Reactant Products n-Pentane 2-Pentene Pentadiene and cyclopentene Butadiene No products No products Diethylbenzenes, ethyldimethylbenzenes, tetramethylbenzenes, minor amounts of 1-methyl-lH-indene and 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene Styrene, ethylbenzene, minor amounts of 1,3,6 octatriene, 2,5-dihydrofuran, toluene and benzene Temperature=340, feed composition=l mol% hydrocarbon in He.

Possible mechanism of the acid-catalysed dimerization of pentadiene and successive transformation to a cyclic unsaturated Clo compound occurring on the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. Reactions reported represent possible pathways, but obviously other products can form. deactivation because of the formation of heavy compounds which remained adsorbed on the catalyst surface. It is clear that the acid centres of the catalyst can dimerize the pentadiene, cyclize the dimer and finally dehydrogenate it (through a mechanism of H-transfer, or by using the oxygen of the catalyst bulk) till the corresponding Clo alkylaromatic is obtained (Scheme 3). Therefore, the Clo alkylaromatic can be the precursor of phthalic anhydride (after decarboxylation of two carbon atoms). It is worth mentioning that alkylaromatics also formed from butadiene, and therefore, there is no need to postulate an intermediate cyclization stage (which anyway may occur for C>4) as a necessary step for the transformation of pentadiene to the phthalic anhydride precursor. In the presence of acid centres, the formation of the cyclic compound will certainly occur for compounds with C>4, and an equilibrium between the cyclo- and the linear hydrocarbons will possibly establish. On the other hand, the production of styrene and ethylbenzene from butadiene, as well as the absence of xylenes, indicates that the formation of alkylaromatics occurs through a much more specific reaction than an acid-catalysed transforma- tion. If the latter were the case, in fact, the formation of xylenes and styrene would be equally likely. Therefore it is possible to hypothesize a more specific mechan- 214 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 \\ 1 1 \"~'lk a b c Scheme 4.

In any case, the absence of xylenes may explain the negligible yield of phthalic anhydride in n-butane oxidation. The same reactions illustrated in Scheme 4 might also occur between a molecule of diolefin and an olefin, but not between two molecules of olefins. In agreement, the 2-pentene did not yield any product under anaerobic conditions (Table 5); this confirms that the allylic H- abstraction of the adsorbed olefin to the diolefin is a necessary step in the formation of the aromatic compounds. 3. 7. The mechanism of n-pentane oxidation to maleic and phthalic anhydrides A possible mechanism of n-pentane oxidation to maleic and phthalic anhydrides is summarized in Scheme 5, as inferred from the data reported here. The paraffin is first oxydehydrogenated to pentene, and then oxidized to pentadiene. Pentadiene can be in equilibrium with cyclopentene (the latter yields the same products as pentadiene under anaerobic conditions); the cyclization may occur either via an allylic H-abstraction on pentadiene, or via an acid-catalysed mechanism.

For sake of simplicity, the parallel and consecutive reactions of combustion have not been indicated. unsaturated C5 compound can either be oxidized to maleic anhydride (with a mechanism analogous to that proposed for the oxidation of n-butane, except for an additional decarboxylation step), or be transformed to an alkylaromatic compound as described above. The final aromatization step can occur either via an H-transfer mechanism or by oxidative dehydrogenation. Finally, the alkylaromatic possessing two neighbouring methyl groups is oxidized to phthalic anhydride. The pentadiene is, therefore, a common intermediate in the two reactions of maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride formation; from a kinetic point of view the two reactions can be considered as parallel ones [10,13]. The intermediate dimerization or condensation step is thermodynamically unfavoured at high temperature, but the irreversible following steps may continuously shift the equilibrium towards the formation of the products.

Against the mechanism proposed in Scheme 5 is the fact that o-xylene has not been observed amongst the products in the oxidation of n-pentane, 2-pentene or pentadiene. However, Fig. 6 (which reports the 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane conver- sion and the selectivity to the products as functions of the cycloparaffin content in feed) shows that for low reactant concentration the hydrocarbon is completely transformed to carbon oxides and phthalic anhydride; intermediate o-xylene is not desorbed under these conditions, because it is quickly transformed to the final products. Low concentrations of hydrocarbon better simulate the situation occur- ring at the catalyst surface during n-pentane oxidation, when the concentration of intermediates produced is supposed to be very low. 4.

Competitive reactions in the transformation of n-paraffins over V-P-O-based catalysts On the basis of the results obtained it is possible to draw a general reaction network for the transformation of paraffins over vanadyl pyrophosphate E Cavani, F.

A summary of the possible reactions which occur when n-paraffins are oxidized over vanadyl pyrophosphate. The transformation of the model molecule n-pentane is represented. (Scheme 6). This scheme arises from the unique combination of acid and oxidizing properties of this catalytic system, and includes many different reactions. The nature of the prevailing product under aerobic conditions depends on the reaction which is kinetically favoured. In particular: (1) For ethane, the two competitive pathways are the oxydehydrogenation to ethylene and the direct oxidation of the methyl group to yield acetic acid (however, the latter is not favoured over the vanadyl pyrophosphate). At the temperatures which are needed to activate the paraffin (and to reach acceptable conversions), reversible exothermic reactions (such as dimerization) are thermodynamically unfavoured. (2) For propane, oxydehydrogenation followed by allylic oxidation (O-insertion) is the only pathway. Dimerization is thermodynamically unfavoured at the temperatures which are needed to activate this paraffin. (3) For n-butane, the specific properties of the vanadyl pyrophosphate make the reaction pathway leading to the formation of maleic anhydride quicker than other parallel reactions. This is achieved in the presence of available oxygen-insertion sites, in an array of active centres each one playing a peculiar role in the multistep mechanism which leads to maleic anhydride. The temperatures which are needed for C4 activation are lower than for lighter paraffins. The parallel pathway of dimerization of intermediate olefins leads to the formation of alkylaromatic 218 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 products whose fate is not to be converted to phthalic anhydride, but rather to carbon oxides or to maleic anhydride. (4) For isobutane, the same considerations apply as for propane. (5) For n-pentane, the same considerations which have been done for n-butane are still valid. In this case, however, the reaction of 1,4 O-insertion on the diolefin has to compete with the parallel pathway of diolefin dimerization or condensation, which leads to the precursor of phthalic anhydride. (6) For n-hexane, a favoured route would be the one leading to benzene and then to maleic anhydride (and this is indeed the preferred one when starting from cyclohexane). However, the intermediate olefins and diolefins are readily trans- formed to oxygenated compounds which are unstable in the reaction environment, and are, therefore, burnt to carbon oxides. This route is quicker than that leading to maleic anhydride. The dimerization route may also occur, but leads to unsaturated compounds which are not precursors of phthalic anhydride and undergo con- secutive reactions of combustion. (7) For cycloheptane and cyclooctane the same considerations apply as for cyclohexane. In addition, the formation of an alkylaromatic compound necessitates a further step of skeletal isomerization, which is slower than the unselective oxidation of intermediate unsaturated cyclic compounds. With cyclooctane, the skeletal isomerization leads to the formation of o-xylene, precursor of phthalic anhydride. 4.2. Properties of the vanadyl pyrophosphate system The polyfunctional nature of the vanadyl pyrophosphate is clearly evidenced by the different classes of reaction which can be catalysed by this material, as summarized in Table 6. Vanadyl pyrophosphate can catalyse most of these transformations with great selectivity; this also indicates that the several steps proposed for the mechanism of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride can effectively occur on vanadyl pyropho- sphate, and that the mechanism postulated can be the true one. The peculiarity of vanadyl pyrophosphate, however, also is related to the possibility of catalyzing each step in the right sequence; for instance, the transformation of intermediate butene to butadiene must be quicker than the allylic oxygen-insertion, in order to favour the selective pathway to maleic anhydride instead of the formation of other oxygenated compounds (which are also possible precursors of carbon oxides) [23]. This specific property can be considered as typical of the vanadyl pyrophosphate; for instance, in the case of the V-Mo--O system the rate of oxygen-insertion (well represented by the reaction of benzene oxidation to maleic anhydride) is very high in comparison to that of n-butane oxidation. In fact, the V-Mo-O system is selective in benzene oxidation but not in n-butane oxidation [43]. In conclusion, the results reported here give indications on the reactivity of the vanadyl pyrophosphate: E Cavani, E Trifir~/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 Table 6 Classes of reaction catalysed by the vanadyl pyrophosphate [18,19] 219 Reactant Product Reaction type Isobutyric acid Methacrylic acid Cyclohexane Benzene Succinic anhydride Maleic anhydride Hexahydrophthalic anhydride Phthalic anhydride Paraffin Olefin Olefin Diolefin 2,5-Dihydrofuran Tetrahydrophthalic anhydride Furan Phthalic anhydride Benzene Maleic anhydride Naphthalene Naphthoquinone Furan Maleic anhydride Oxydehydrogenation Allylic oxidation (H-abstraction or Ooinsertion) Electrophilic oxygen-insertion (1) This system possesses sites able to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. This is demonstrated by the formation of benzene with high specificity from cyclohexane, as well as by the formation of olefins and diolefins from n- paraffins, of aromatic compounds from decaline, and of cycloolefins from cyclo- paraffins. However, this is not the optimal system for the synthesis of light olefins from paraffins. (2) It possesses centres able to perform with great specificity the allylic oxidation. This is the reason why vanadyl pyrophosphate does not yield olefins with great selectivity in the oxidation of C>2 paraffins. In fact the desorption of intermediate olefins is not allowed, since they are quickly transformed to the oxygenated products. Only when molecular oxygen is lacking (and the catalyst possesses a low number of oxygen-insertion sites), the olefin can be saved from consecutive transformations, and a good selectivity to the olefin can be achieved. (3) It possesses centres able to insert oxygen into electron-rich substrates. (4) The oxidation state of vanadium under reaction conditions is a very important parameter in the control of the process selectivity; a certain number of oxidized vanadium sites is necessary to transform the intermediate olefins to the oxygenated products. On the other hand, an overoxidized surface may be responsible for the consecutive oxidative degradation of the desired products. When olefins are used as the reactant, the interaction of the electron-rich organic substrate with the vanadium ions leads to a reduction of the latter, and hence to a lower availability of oxygen-insertion sites. The average oxidation state of vanadium under reaction conditions is determined by the nature of the V-P-O phases which have formed during the catalyst activation and ageing (i.e., during the thermal treatment), and by the operative conditions [ 13]. One main property of the vanadyl pyrophosphate is its ability to easily undergo reversible structural changes, from vVoPO4 phases to 220 E Cavani, E Trifirb/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 195-221 the (vIVo)2P207 phase [44-46]. It is known that the active and selective catalyst for the oxidation of n-butane is constituted of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, but that the latter can \"host\" at its surface Vv sites, which positively contribute in the mechanism of selective transformation of the paraffin to maleic anhydride [30-32]. (5) It possesses acid centres, able to perform a number of different transforma- tions; some of these reactions do not need a strong acidity (condensation, dimerization), but some do need alkylation or aromatics with olefins and skeletal isomerization of cycloparaffins. (6) It may favour bimolecular condensation reactions which are not acid- catalysed, but which are accelerated by the proper geometry of sites at which the molecules are adsorbed. This property likely plays an important role in the development of the phthalic anhydride precursor from intermediate pentadiene [10].

Trifirò ∗ Dipartimento di Chimica Industriale e dei Materiali Viale Risorgimento 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy ∗ Corresponding author. Fax: +39 51 6443680 The surface properties of the VPO-based catalysts are discussed referring to their reactivity towards different organic substrates. Various saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons were fed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the results were discussed in terms of the main surface characteristics of the active component, the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7. The combination of acid and oxygen-insertion properties of the vanadyl pyrophosphate makes several contemporaneous reactions possible, and the final products distribution is a function of (i) the reaction conditions, which also affect the average oxidation state of vanadium, (ii) the extent of the interaction between the hydrocarbon and the surface, and (iii) the tendency of the activated hydrocarbon to undergo acid-catalysed transformations rather than oxidative ones.
