Results show that the elimination of inorganic impurities, mainly sulphur, enhances the nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate. Moreover, the functionalization treatments of purified carbon with ozone and hydrogen peroxide have a positive effect both on the Pt dispersion and on the hydrogenation capacity of the catalyst, while the HNO3-treatment has a lower effect. The effect of the different oxidants can be related to the nature of the functional groups developed on the carbon surface. Thus, HNO3-treated carbon displays a high density of both strong and weak acid sites, while H202- and O3-treated carbons show an important concentration of weak acid sites but a low concentration of strong acid sites, according to the TPD results. Moreover, the H2PtCI6 isotherms in liquid phase at 298 K show a stronger interaction of the metallic precursor with the carbons of low acidity (like those treated with H202 or 03) than with the most acidic carbon (treated with HNO3). Carbons functionalized with weak oxidants, which develop acidic sites with moderate strength and show strong interaction with H2PtC16 during impregnation, would favour the PI dispersion on the carbon surface and consequently the catalytic behaviour. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The textural characteristics are mainly defined during the genesis of carbon. The inorganic salts can be concentrated on the surface [5] and they can interact with the active metallic phase, thus modifying the catalytic behaviour [6]. Hence, the elimination of inorganic impurities of carbon before being used as a support must be taken into account. A 0926-860X/97/$17.00 .~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Torres et aL/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 major fraction of these impurities can be removed from the raw material by acidic extraction treatments [6-8]. The anchorage of the metallic precursor on the carbon surface is a critical point during the preparation of supported metallic catalysts. It is known that the interaction of the metallic precursor with the support depends on the nature of the surface groups [9-14]. Several types of surface functional groups can be produced as a consequence of the oxidation treat- ments. Thus, carboxylic, phenolic, carbonyls, anhy- drides, lactones and peroxides have been suggested as acidic surface groups produced by oxidation treat- ments [15]. These acidic groups can be progressively destroyed by thermal treatments [ 16]. When the func- tional carbon is hydrated, hydroxyl groups can be developed on the surface [ 17]. These hydroxyl groups behave as amphoteric species being dissociated or protonated depending on the pH of the solution. Hence, the selection of the metallic precursor (anionic or cationic complex) will be determined by the pre- sence of protonated or dissociated centres [ 13] and by the pH of the solution. Platinum/carbon catalysts are widely used in a great variety of reactions mainly hydrogenations [8,18,19] and oxidations [20]. In these applications, it is claimed that small metal particles are required for the optimal utilization of the noble metal deposited on the support. However, conflicting points of view regarding the effect of the metal dispersion, the valence state of the metal and the nature of the metal-support inter- action on the catalytic behaviour are found in the literature. For instance, in a careful XPS/SIMS study of the surface groups of a commercial carbon, the O/C atomic ratio decreased when the carbon was treated with mineral acid [21], but this O/C ratio increased in carbons submitted to an HzO2-oxidation treatment, which produced a decrease in the platinum crystal size [9]. These latter findings are in disagreement with the observation of other authors [22], who found a parallel increase of both the O/C ratio and the crystal size. In this context, this work was undertaken with the aim to understand the influence of the functional groups of carbon on the formation and stabilization of the supported platinum phase and consequently on its catalytic performance. For this purpose, the raw car- bon and the functionalized carbons (after HNO3, 03 or H202 treatment) were studied by N2 adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption. Moreover, the HzPtCI6 adsorption isotherms were also determined. Pt/C catalysts were studied by H2 chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy, and tested in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction. This information is dis- cussed in the frame of the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in liquid phase. 2. Experimental A commercial peach pit derived carbon (GA-160 from Carbonac) was used as a support. This carbon was crushed and sieved to a final particle size between 100 and 140 mesh. The content of impurities in the raw carbon was 2.9 wt%. The commercial support (without further treatment) was labelled as C-ST. A fraction of the commercial carbon was purified (elim- ination of inorganic impurities) by successive treat- ments with aqueous solutions (10 wt%) of HC1, HNO3 and HF at room temperature during 48 h. The ratio between the volume of each acid solution and the carbon weight was 1.6 ml g-1. After HC1 and HNO3 treatments, the carbon was repeatedly washed with deionized water up to a final pH=4. After the HF- treatment, the carbon was washed with deionized water up to a final pH=7, and then it was dried at 393 K during 24 h. The acid-treated carbon was alter- natively submitted to a thermal treatment with 5 ml of He or H2min-lg 1 at 1123K during 8h. These samples were labelled as CP-He and CP-H2, respec- tively. Purified CP-He and CP-H2 carbons were sub- sequently submitted to alternative functionalization procedures: (i) treatment with H202 aqueous solution (10 v/v%) at room temperature during 48 h (samples labelled as CP-He-HP and CP-H2-HP), (ii) treatment with HNO3 aqueous solution (10 wt%) at room tem- perature during 48 h (samples labelled as CP-He-N and CP-H2-N) or (iii) treatment with an 03 (1.5 v/v%)- N2 mixture at 773 K during 2 h (samples labelled as CP-He-O3 and CP-H2-O3). The functionalized HNO3- and H2Oz-carbons were dried at 393 K during 24 h. The characterization of the porous structure of starting, purified and functionalized carbons was car- ried out by physical adsorption of N2 at 77 K by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. The analysis G.C. Torres et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 215 of the impurities of starting and purified carbons was carried out by EDX on the ashes of the carbons, which were obtained by total burn-off of carbons with air at 773 K in an electric furnace. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was used to identify the oxidized functional groups of different carbons. Each sample was pre-treated under vacuum at 303 K for 1 h. Then, it was heated in an electric furnace at 10 K min i from 303 to 1273 K under vacuum (10-4 Torr). The desorbed products were analysed by mass spectrometry using a Balzers QMG- 125 equipment coupled on line with the vacuum system. Chloroplatinic acid adsorption isotherms on the different carbons were also obtained. For this purpose, the support was put in contact at room temperature with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution (with a given initial concentration) until reaching the equili- brium. The equilibrium Pt concentrations in the liquid and in the solid phases were determined by chemical analysis. The different points of the isotherms were obtained by modifying the initial HzPtC16 concentra- tion in the impregnating solution. Pt/C catalysts were prepared by impregnation of carbons with an aqueous solution of HzPtC16 with a concentration such as to obtain a Pt loading of 1 wt% in all cases. The ratio between the volume of impreg- nating solution and the carbon weight was 30 ml g-l. The supports were maintained in contact with the impregnating solution under stirring at 298 K during 5 h. Then, the solid was separated by filtration and dried at 393 K during 24 h. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experi- ments were carried out in an automatic equipment coupled to a data acquisition station. Since water is produced during the sample reduction, the gas exiting the reactor was passed through a cold trap before entering to the thermal conductivity detector. In these experiments 100rag of sample was heated at 10 K min ~ from 290 up to 773 K while a H2 (10 v/v%)-Ar gaseous mixture (50cm3 STP min-~) flowed through the reactor. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained by using a Fisions ESCALAB MkII 200R spectro- meter fitted with a MgKcx (1253.6 eV) source oper- ated at 12 kV and 10 mA and a spherical electron analyser. Before analysis, samples were pre-treated \"in situ\" with He at 623 K. The ion pumper analysis chamber was maintained below l0 9 Torr during the data acquisition. Peak areas were estimated by calcu- lating the integral of each peak after subtraction of the S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak by Lorentzian-Gaussian mix. Binding energies were referenced to C ls peak at 284.9 eV. The Pt dispersion was determined from the H2 chemisorption isotherm. The catalyst sample was reduced with Hz at 623 K during 4 h, then it was outgassed under high vacuum (10 4 Tort) at 623 K for 1 h. When the sample was cooled down to room temperature, the chemisorption test begun. The H2 monolayer amount was used to calculate the Pt dis- persion (D). The catalytic activity for cyclohexane (CH) dehy- drogenation was determined at atmospheric pressure in a differential flow reactor by using a H2-CH mixture (H2/CH molar ratio=26) and a CH volumetric flow of 6 cm3h i. The sample weight used in the experiments was such as to obtain a CH conversion lower than 5%. The activation energy of this reaction was obtained by measuring the catalytic activity at 543, 558 and 573 K. Catalysts were tested in the nitrobenzene hydroge- nation reaction in liquid phase. A batch reactor with a magnetic stirrer was used for these experiments. Hydrogen was introduced in the reactor through a manifold and its consumption was measured in a gas burette assembled to the system. The reaction was carried out at 298 K using 0.025 g of catalysts, 0.25 ml of nitrobenzene and 25 ml of ethanol. The stirring rate was 500 rpm. Before reaction, catalysts were reduced \"in situ\" under flowing H2 at 373 K for 3 h. Reaction products were analysed in a GC chromatograph by using a Carbowax 20 M on Chromosorb column. Liquid samples were intermittently withdrawn from the reactor and analysed in order to monitor the product distribution as a function of time. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of supports 3.1. I. Effect of the purification treatment The efficiency of the purification treatment was reflected by the decrease of the impurities content from 2.9 wt% for the starting carbon to 0.16 wt% for 216 G.C.

Results of the elementary ana- lysis of the impurities of the starting and purified carbons (obtained by EDX) are shown in Fig. I. It is observed that Na, Si, P, K, Ca, CI and, in a minor C-ST extension Mg and Fe, were depleted by the purifica- CP-He tion treatment. Moreover, it must be indicated that CP-He-N very small differences in the impurities contents were CP-He-HP found for purified Hz-treated samples with respect to CP-He-O3 those treated with He, except for S, such as shown in CP-H2 CP-Hz-N Fig. 1. In fact, the content of sulphur was practically CP-Hz-HP unmodified by the He-treatment, while after the H2- CP-H2-O3 treatment, this element was practically depleted according to EDX results. 3.1.2. Characterization of textural properties The effect of purification and functionalization treatments of carbon on the textural properties (BET surface area and micropore volume) is shown Table 1 Textural characteristics of the different carbons Carbon sample SBET (m2 g 1) Vrnicrop.

It is observed that the purification treat- ment (acid extraction) and subsequent He-treatment do not modify the textural characteristics of the sup- port. For He-treated supports and submitted to differ- ent functionalization treatments, a similar behaviour G.C. Torres et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 217 was found. In fact, a slight modification in the SBET and in the pore volume with respect to the purified sample was observed for functionalized carbons pre- treated in He. The textural characteristics of purified carbon pre- treated with H2 were similar to those corresponding to the purified carbon pre-treated with He. Functiona- lized carbons pre-treated with H2 display some differ- ences with the corresponding functionalized carbons pre-treated with He, but such differences are not very important so as to consider that an important mod- ification of the textural characteristics is produced by the H2-treatment. 3.1.3. Characterization of functional groups by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) The oxidized surface groups of the different sup- ports were characterized by TPD. According to the literature, these surface complexes decompose upon heating desorbing CO2 at low temperatures and CO at high temperatures [10]. Fig. 2 shows the CO2 and CO desorption profiles of CP-He, CP-He-N, CP-He-O3 and CP-He-HP carbons. The CO2 desorption profile of CP-He is very small and shows a small peak at low temperature (523 K). TPD profiles of functionalized carbons with H202 and 03 display CO2 desorption peaks slightly higher than that corresponding to the CP-He sample. On the other hand, the TPD profile of CP-He-N shows two CO2 desorption peaks, the first at 388 K and the second is a broad peak with a maximum at 663 K. The amount of CO2 desorbed from the different carbons follows this sequence: CP- He < CP- He- HP - CP- He- 03 << CP- He- N Similar CO2-TPD profiles and sequence of amounts of desorbed CO2 were found for the functionalized Hz- treated samples. The CO desorption profile of CP-He is small and very broad and it displays a maximum at 1128 K. A similar CO desorption profile (but more intense) was obtained for the CP-He-HP sample. The CO desorp- tion profiles of CP-He-O3 and CP-He-N samples are very similar, displaying two peaks, one at 953 K and the other at 1065 K, probably corresponding to the decomposition of different weak acidic functional groups. The CO amount desorbed from the different CP-He-N CO ........ C02 2_>, .,p_o CP-He 275 475 673 873 1075 1275 T,K Fig. 2.

It is claimed in the literature [15] that the oxidation treatments of carbons lead to different surface acid groups: carboxylic, anhydrides, lactones, phenols and carbonyls groups. Carboxylic and anhydrides are con- sidered as strong acid groups, meanwhile lactones, phenols and carbonyls groups would display weaker acid properties [18]. Moreover, it has been reported that the strong acid groups lead to a CO2-desorption during TPD experiments, in contrast with the weaker 218 G.C. Torres et aL/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 acid sites which lead to a CO-desorption [10]. Taking into account this evidence, our TPD results would indicate that the HNO3-treatment of carbon produce a high density of both strong and weak acid groups. On the other hand, H202- and O3-0xidation treatments produce a lower concentration of strong acid groups with respect to the HNO3-0xidation treatment, while an important concentration of weak acid groups was produced by the O3-treatment. The treatment of car- bon with H202 has a slight effect on the concentration of weak acid groups. It must be noted that Suh et al. [18] and Coloma et al. [13] found similar results for HNO3- and H202-treated carbons. 3.1.4. H2PtCI6 adsorption isotherms Figs. 3 and 4 show the H2PtC16 adsorption iso- therms on carbons pre-treated with He and H2, and the corresponding functionalized ones. These iso- therms cannot be described as a Langmuir-type pro- cess. The shape of the isotherms would indicate that Pt adsorption on the carbon surface is not a simple process. In fact, all isotherms display a first portion where H2PtCI6 is very strongly adsorbed and a second portion where a weak adsorption appears to be occur- ring. In any case, the H2PtC16 adsorption is modified by the treatment of the support. Taking into account that all supports have similar surface area and pore volume (Table 1), the different behaviour towards H2PtC16 adsorption may be produced by the different surface chemistry of the support as a consequence of the purification and functionalization treatments. A similar trend in the adsorption strength (given by the slope of the isotherm at very low H2PtC16 equilibrium concentration in liquid phase) and in the adsorption capacity was found for both He and H2-treated and functionalized carbons series. Thus, purified carbons (CP-He and CP-H2) show both the highest strength and the highest adsorption capacity, followed by the H202-treated carbon and, in a decreasing sequence, by the O3-functionalized carbon and finally by the HNO3- treated one. In order to explain these behaviours, TPD results must be taken into account. In fact, HNO3- treated carbons display a higher concentration of strong acid groups than the 03 and H202-treated ones. ~.0.16{ o'T/. _z o.o6~/ ~0.04 :cj0.02 0~- 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 CP-He + CP-He-HP CP-He-O3 CP-He-N 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 [ H PtCl ]eq IN LIQUID PHASE, (g Pt/I) 2 6 Fig. 3.

H2PtC16 adsorption isotherms in liquid phase at 298 K on purified and functionalized H2-pre-treated carbons. It has been reported in the literature that highly acidic carbons (like those treated with HNO3) lead to a lower ZPC, and in this condition the PtC16 adsorption from an acid solution (H2PtC16) is unfavourable [ 13]. On the other hand, 03- and HzO2-treated carbons have a lower density of strong acid groups, which would increase the ZPC and, in consequence, the PtC16 adsorption would be favoured. In the case of purified carbons (pre-treated with He or H2), the major fraction of acidic groups are destroyed by the thermal treat- ments. However, these carbons display both the high- est strength and adsorption capacity. It must be indicated that van Dam and van Bekkum [11] reported a stronger interaction of HzPtC16 on carbon pre-treated with H2 than on functionalized carbons obtained by using different HNO3 concentrations, which is in agreement with our results. These authors proposed a PtCI~ adsorption model consisting in two-step pro- cess, where first Pt(IV) is reduced to Pt(II), which is then coordinatively bound by the carrier on two different sites: (a) C=C structures in the basal planes and (b) oxygen-containing functional groups on the edges of the basal plane of the carbon. The higher adsorption strength observed by van Dam and van Bekkum [1 l] on Hz-treated carbons is attributed to the higher reductive capacity of this carbon with respect to functionalized ones. 3.2. Characterization of the metallic phase 3.2.1. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) Figs. 5 and 6 show the TPR profiles of the different Pt catalysts supported on the purified carbons (CP-He and CP-Hz) and on the corresponding functionalized carbons (CP-He-HE CP-He-O3, CP-He-N, CP-Hz-HP, CP-H2-O3 and CP-Hz-N). By comparing Figs. 5 and 6, it can be noted that TPR profiles of Pt/C catalysts prepared on functionalized carbons pre-treated with He are similar to those corresponding to catalysts prepared on carbons pre-treated with H2. The profiles of the different Pt catalysts display a first reduction zone at 473-500 K, due to the reduction of the anionic Pt precursor, and a second reduction zone at higher temperatures (573-623 K). This second reduction 220 G.C. Torres et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 t5 t- O c3 E ~o c- o 0 OJ \"I\" Pt/CP-He-N Pt/CP-He-O3 , Pt/CP- He- HP 273 373 473 573 673 T,K Fig. 5.

[12]. The desorp- tion of carboxylic groups would leave new reactive sites on the support, which can interact with atomic hydrogen (originated by dissociation of molecular H2 on the particles of metallic Pt). Taking into account that TPR profiles of carbons (before Pt impregnation) did not show He consumption in the range of reduction temperatures (298-773 K), it must be inferred that the dissociation of molecular hydrogen only occurs on the Pt/C catalysts (after Pt reduction) but not on the support alone (without metal). It must be noted that the second reduction zone is more intense for Pt catalysts supported on HNO3-functionalized carbons, which develop the highest amount of carboxylic groups according to TPD results. It can also be observed from Figs. 5 and 6 that the temperature corresponding to the maximum of the first reduction peak in catalysts prepared on HNO3-functionalized carbons is shifted to higher values than in the other catalysts. The different behaviour of Pt/CP-He(or H2)- N catalysts during the TPR experiments can be explained considering that the first reduction zone can be produced not only by the reduction of anionic Pt species but also by the reduction of the reactive sites G.C.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Table 2 shows the binding energies of core elec- trons corresponding to C 1 s and Pt 4fvn of different Pt catalysts supported on CP-H2 carbons functionalized with HNO3, 03 and H202, after a reduction treatment at 623 K during 1 h. Two C 1 s peaks at 284.9 (corre- sponding to graphitic carbon) and at 286.3-286.4 eV (corresponding to -C-O bonds) were detected in all the samples. The values between parentheses (Table 2) correspond to the percentage of each struc- ture. It can be observed that the Pt/CP-H2-N catalyst shows the highest percentage of-C-O groups, fol- lowed by the Pt/CP-H2-O3 sample. These results are in agreement with those found by TPD. The signal of Pt 4f7/2 at 71.9-72.0 eV, observed in all Pt/C catalysts (irrespective of the previous functionalization treat- ments of the support), can be assigned to a metallic state of Pt in the reduced catalysts, though the litera- ture values for the Pt4fw2 level of metallic platinum ranged between 71.0 and 71.3 eV [23].

Samples were previously reduced at 623 K. towards higher binding energies (+0.6-0.7eV) observed for our catalysts could be due to electronic effects produced by the presence of very small and highly dispersed Pt particles supported on the acti- vated carbons. Besides, similar binding energies values of Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt catalysts supported on carbons with different amounts of functional groups (Pt/C and Pt/C-H202) were also found by Coloma et al. [13]. 3.2.3. 1-12 chemisorption and cyclohexane dehydrogenation Table 3 shows the Pt dispersion values for the different catalysts. The Pt dispersion of catalysts supported on functionalized H2-treated carbons are much higher than those corresponding to catalysts supported on functionalized He-treated ones. These differences can be related to the poisoning effect of S in He-treated samples. In both catalysts series (He or Hz-treated supports), the Pt dispersion follows a simi- lar sequence: Pt/CP-N<Pt/CP<Pt/CP-HP<Pt/CP-O3. The beneficial effect of the 03 treatment on the final metallic dispersion in both catalysts series is observed. Considering that the purified and functionalized car- bons display similar textural characteristics, the Pt dispersion appears to be related to the chemistry of the carbon surface. It has been reported in the literature that the Pt dispersion can be controlled by the che- mical nature of the support if the textural character- istics of the carbon are kept constant [24]. Hence, taking into account the above dispersion sequence and the functional groups created by the different functio- nalization treatments of the carbon (see TPD experi- ments), we can conclude that the Pt dispersion would be favoured in functionalized carbons with a low concentration of strong acidic centers and a high concentration of weak acidic sites. Table 3 also shows the behaviour of the different catalysts in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction (initial reaction rates and activation energies). The effect of sulphur poisoning in catalysts pre-treated with He is observed since these samples display lower activities than catalysts prepared on carbons pre-trea- ted with H2. On the other hand, samples supported on functionalized carbons with moderate acidity (like those supported on CP-H2-O3 and CP-Hz-H202) show both the highest activity and the highest platinum dispersion, such as shown in Table 3. TON values for the different catalysts are similar (between 100 and 200), which is in agreement with the structure- insensitive characteristics of the cyclohexane dehy- drogenation reaction. The activation energies for the different catalysts are also similar which would indi- cate that there is no electronic modification of the metallic phase due to its interaction with the different functionalized carbons, in agreement with our XPS results.

Evaluation of catalysts in nitrobenzene hydrogenation The pattern of the distribution of reaction products in the nitrobenzene hydrogenation with time was similar for all the catalysts. As an example, Fig. 7 summarizes the distribution of the reaction products for Pt/CP-He-HP. A first reaction step, where nitro- benzene (Ph-NO2) is rapidly transformed into aniline (Ph-NH2) as a major product, is observed. In a parallel way, small quantities of phenylhydroxylamine (Ph- NHOH) are also produced as an intermediate product. In the second step, after the major fraction of nitro- benzene was reacted, phenylhydroxylamine was slowly transformed into aniline. It was found in all cases that the amount of consumed hydrogen followed a linear function with the reaction time for both the first and the second reaction steps. It must be indicated that the reaction rates reported in this paper were calculated from the slope of the linear function (H2 consumption vs. time) corresponding to the first reac- tion step. Table 4 compiles the results of reaction rates obtained for Pt/C catalysts prepared on C-ST, CP- He, CP-He-HP, CP-He-N, CP-He-O3, CP-H2, CP-H2- Table 4 Initial hydrogenation rate (r0) at 298 K and TON values for different catalysts in nitrobenzene hydrogenation in liquid phase Sample ro (1/g Pt min) TON Pt/C-ST 1.13 Pt/CP-He 1.45 17.47 Pt/CP-He-N 1.40 20.29 Pt/CP-He-HP 1.53 11.50 Pt/CP-He-O3 1.53 9.62 Pt/CP-H2 4.03 11.99 Pt/CP-H2-N 5.07 16.35 Pt/CP-H2-HP 6.00 15.80 Pt/CP-H2-O~ 5.75 13.59 HP, CP-H2-N and CP-H2-O3. It can be observed that the purification treatment and subsequent He-treat- ment enhances the hydrogenation reaction rate with respect to Pt/C-ST catalyst. The lower activity of the catalyst prepared on the starting carbon can be explained in terms of the enrichment of the carbon surface with inorganic impurities, which can interact with the active metal thus modifying the catalytic behaviour [5,6]. It must also be noted that the func- tionalization treatments only produce a slight modi- 224 G.C.

Taking into account that the purified carbon treated with He (CP-He) retained not only the textural char- acteristics but also the sulphur contained in the starting carbon, reaction rate measurements on catalysts pre- pared on purified H2-treated carbons and subsequently submitted to functionalization treatments (Pt/CP-H2, Pt/CP-H2-N, Pt/CP-H2-O3 and Pt/CP-H2-HP) were made in order to analyse the effect of sulphur. It must be remembered that the H2-treatment leads to a com- plete elimination of sulphur, according to the above mentioned EDX results. Table 4 shows a different catalytic behaviour of these Pt/CP-H2-(N, HP or 03) catalysts with respect to the corresponding sam- ples prepared on He-treated carbon. These results clearly indicate that the differences in the activities are due to the poisoning effect of sulphur. In the case of Pt/C samples prepared on H2-treated carbon, the catalytic behaviour depends on the functionalization treatment. The Pt/CP-H2 sample displays a similar dispersion but a lower activity in nitrobenzene hydro- genation than Pt/CP-Ha-N, which means that in the first catalyst the Pt particles are well dispersed but the anchorage of Pt on the basal planes of carbon would lead to some inaccessible sites for these reactions. The sequence of activity observed for both Pt catalysts series supported on functionalized carbons appears to be related to Pt dispersion. Fig. 8 shows the influence of the Pt dispersion on the activities of both reactions (CH dehydrogenation and nitrobenzene hydrogena- tion). In this way, the Pt dispersion plays an important role in both catalytic activities, though it must be noted that in some cases the activity does not improve in proportion to the dispersion, which means that other effects could be present. These effects could be due to the different distribution and localization of the Pt particles in the inner porous structure of the carbon, such as Suh et al. [14] reported in a previous paper. In this way, Pt particles located in very narrow pores could not easily contact large reactant molecules. Besides, Tables 3 and 4 show that the TON values G.C. Torres et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 213-226 225 (TON=rdl0-2 D; ro: initial reaction rate, D: percen- tage of Pt dispersion) in the CH dehydrogenation and in the nitrobenzene hydrogenation lie in a narrow range (between 100 and 200 and between 10 and 20, respectively), which can indicate that both reac- tions are structure-insensitive ones. Hence, the cata- lytic activities in these reactions will be mainly defined by the Pt dispersion. The different distribution and localization of Pt particles in some catalysts could also explain the small differences of TON values for these reactions. the Pt dispersion on the carbon surface and con- sequently the catalytic behaviour. In conclusion, the higher Pt dispersion of catalysts supported on functionalized carbons would be favoured in car- bons with low concentration of strong acidic cen- tres and high concentration of weak acidic sites. The catalytic activity of Pt/C catalysts for CH dehydrogenation and nitrobenzene hydrogenation is mainly defined by the Pt dispersion, but other effects like Pt particles distribution in the inner porous structure of the support, could play a role in the catalytic behaviour. 4. Conclusions The elimination of inorganic impurities of the carbon has a beneficial effect on the catalytic activity. In this sense, sulphur plays an important role due to its poisoning action on the metallic phase with the subsequent decrease of the hydro- genation-dehydrogenation activities. The functionalization treatment of purified and Hz-treated carbon with 03, H202 and HNO3 enhances the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation capacities, but this effect depends on the oxidant type. Thus, 03 and H202 appear as more efficient that HNO3. This different behaviour can be related to the concentration and strength of the acidic surface groups produced by the different oxidants. The HNO3-treatment produces a high concentra- tion of strong acidic sites, while H202 and O3 only enhance the population of weak acid groups, according to TPD results. Chloroplatinic adsorption isotherms show that the interaction of the metallic precursor with the carbon surface is higher for carbons with low acidity (like those functionalized by H202- or O3-treatment) than for the highly acid supports (HNO3-treated ones). TPR, XPS and Activation Energies (for CH de- hydrogenation reaction) results would indicate that the state of the metal after reduction is similar for all Pt/C catalysts irrespective of the previous functionalization treatments. Carbons functionalized with weak oxidants (like 03 and H202), which develop acidic sites with moderate strength and show strong interaction with HzPtCI6 during impregnation, would favour Acknowledgements We thank the Secretary of Science and Technology (Universidad Nacional del Litorai) for the financial support.

This paper reports a study of the effect of the purification and functionalization treatments of a peach pit derived carbon on the properties and performance for nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction of Pt/C catalysts. Results show that the elimination of inorganic impurities, mainly sulphur, enhances the nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate. Moreover, the functionalization treatments of purified carbon with ozone and hydrogen peroxide have a positive effect both on the Pt dispersion and on the hydrogenation capacity of the catalyst, while the HNO3-treatment has a lower effect. The effect of the different oxidants can be related to the nature of the functional groups developed on the carbon surface. Thus, HNO3-treated carbon displays a high density of both strong and weak acid sites, while H2O2- and O3-treated carbons show an important concentration of weak acid sites but a low concentration of strong acid sites, according to the TPD results. Moreover, the H2PtCl6 isotherms in liquid phase at 298 K show a stronger interaction of the metallic precursor with the carbons of low acidity (like those treated with H2O2 or O3) than with the most acidic carbon (treated with HNO3). Carbons functionalized with weak oxidants, which develop acidic sites with moderate strength and show strong interaction with H2PtCl6 during impregnation, would favour the Pt dispersion on the carbon surface and consequently the catalytic behaviour.
