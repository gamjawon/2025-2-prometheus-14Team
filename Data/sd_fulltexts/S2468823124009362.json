Hydrodeoxygenation is a promising method for producing green diesel from fatty-acid-based biomass. Herein, we have reported NiCo alloy catalyst obtained by reduction of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor, which displays prominent behavior for selective hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids to prepare long-chain alkanes. The optimal Ni1Co1–600 shows catalytic performance (conversion: 99 %; alkanes selectivity: 97 %) in palmitic acid hydrodeoxygenation reaction, with milder conditions compared with previously reported studies on non-precious metal. A combination study including HR-TEM, XAFS and XPS confirms that a strong electron exchange occurs at the NiCo alloy catalys with electron transfer from Ni to Co in the metal. Both kinetic experiments and in situ FT-IR reveal the adsorption configuration of the substrate and the reaction pathway:Firstly, fatty acid is adsorbed at Ni-Co bimetallic sites through carboxyl group in the form of a bidentate bridge adsorption configuration; Then the active site is conducive to the process of decarbonylation of fatty alcohol intermediate to produce alkanes. This versatile catalytic system is poised to expand its applications to a wider array of reactions involving the breakdown of polar chemical bonds.

Among these alternatives, green diesel, as a sustainable substitute for conventional fossil diesel, has garnered significant public and academic attention [5,6]. The reliance on biodiesel (main component is fatty acid ester), characterized by high oxygen content, has led to notable challenges including elevated cold-cranking temperatures, manifested through a high cloud point, and reduced energy density due to lower calorific values. Green diesel emerges as a promising alternative, synthesized through hydrodeoxygenation processes that transform it into a rich reservoir of long-chain hydrocarbons [7–11]. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction primarily occurs through three pathways: decarboxylation (DCO2), decarbonylation (DCO), and direct HDO, where oxygen atoms are removed in the form of CO2, CO, and H2O, respectively [12,13]. Typically, the reaction usually requires high temperatures (320–450 °C) and high hydrogen pressures (4–12 MPa), conditions that increase energy consumption [14,15]. These high energy consumption conditions not only inflate production expenses but also promote sintering or carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, which in turn leads to catalyst deactivation [16,17]. Therefore, the rational design and development of a hydrodeoxygenation catalyst with both high activity and high stability is a key challenge [18,19]. The HDO reaction of fatty acids predominantly relies on two categories of metal catalysts: those based on noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, etc. [20–22]) and non-noble metals (Co, Ni, Cu, Fe, etc. [23–26]). Although precious metal-based catalysts have ideal activity, their high cost limits their large-scale application. Furthermore, extensive research has indicated that sulfidation treatment of catalysts can improve reaction performance. However, the issue of sulfur leaching poses a considerable risk of catalyst deactivation and contamination of the alkane product [27,28]. Improving HDO performance through non-noble metal and non-sulfide catalysts has attracted widespread attention. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of well-structured synthetic two-dimensional anionic hydroxide compounds, consisting of a positively charged main layer and charge-balancing ions spaced apart [29]. Several studies in the literature have highlighted the benefits of LDH phases as catalyst precursors, such as customizable main-layer elements, high dispersion, and structural topological transformation. The benefits of LDHs have roused our interests in utilizing them to generate non-precious metal alloy catalysts incorporating Ni, Co, or Cu within the cationic layer. This enables the production of active metal alloys during the reduction processes, potentially enhancing the interaction between two or three metals through localized electrostatic repulsion in precursor, which may increase the C‒O bond activation capabilities in HDO reaction [30–32]. Herein, we synthesized a series of Ni x Co y alloy catalysts (x: y = 1:0, 4:1, 1:1 and 1:4) derived from Ni x Co y Al z -LDH (x + y: z = 2:1) precursors by carefully regulating the ratio of two metals. The catalytic performance of the HDO reaction for the preparation of alkanes was evaluated to explore how the combination of Ni and Co was expected to provide excellent catalytic performance. In addition, we investigated the influence of the Ni/Co ratio on catalytic efficiency. The structure and composition of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, XPS and XAFS to study potential synergistic interactions between Ni and Co. Further, the structure-activity relationship of the catalyst was explored by a combination of in-situ infrared spectroscopy and kinetic experiments. Based on these analyses, we speculated on the adsorption configuration of fatty acids on NiCo alloys and the subsequent process of alkane formation. This research aims to pave the way for the rational design and development of highly stable heterogeneous HDO catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of catalysts NixCoyAl-LDHs was prepared by urea decomposition [33]. In a typical synthesis, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.05 M), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.05 M), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.05 M) and urea (0.6 M) were dissolved in deionized water (150 mL). The mixed solution was transferred to a sealed Teflon autoclave and heated at 110 °C for 24 h to obtain Ni1Co1Al-LDHs. A series of NixCoy alloy catalysts (x: y = 1:0, 4:1 ,1:1 and 1:4) were also derived from Ni x Co y Al z -LDH (x + y: z = 2:1) precursors by regulating the ratio of two metals. The LDH precursors were reduced at 600 °C for 6 h (the inlet gas is a mixture of H2 and N2 in a volume ratio of 1:9; the heating rate was set to 2 °C/min). Finally, the product was cooled in N2 stream to obtain the Ni-600, Ni4Co1–600, Ni1Co1–600, Ni1Co4–600 and Co-600 samples. 2.2 Characterization procedure X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) with a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 and the 2θ angle range of 3 to 80° Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were captured with Zeiss Supra 55 electron microscopes at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H₂-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics Chemi-Sorb 2720 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A quartz tube reactor containing 100 mg of catalyst was supplied with a H₂/Ar gas mixture (1:9, v/v) at 30 mL/min, and the temperature was ramped to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was carried out on a JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo VG Escalab 250 XPS with a working pressure of 2 × 10−9 Pa and a C 1 s peak value of 284.8 eV X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) was measured at the beamline 1W2B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In situ FT-IR measurements were carried out on a VERTEX 70 spectrometer with a KBr window, with reaction temperature controlled by thermocouples. 25 mg catalyst sample was pressed into a round flake, installed in the reaction chamber, and pretreated at 600 °C in a pure H₂ flow for 1 h, then cooled to room temperature in He. For the CO adsorption test, the baseline signal was collected in 1 % CO/He flow until CO saturation, followed by He purging at 30 mL/min to remove gas-phase CO. In situ FT-IR measurements of propionic acid adsorption were performed using a transmission reactor. The sample was first calcined at 600 °C for 1 h in a pure H2 flow. After an initial background scan, propionic acid was introduced into the reactor via He flow (30 mL/min) for bubbling. After saturation adsorption, the He flow was used to purge the gas-phase adsorbate and spectra were subsequently collected in the range of 2000–1000 cm⁻¹. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation Palmitic acid (0.3 g), dodecane (15 mL) and the catalyst (0.05 g) were placed in a stirred stainless batch reactor (Beijing Century SenLong experimental apparatus Co., Ltd.). For the catalytic evaluation, a stirred stainless batch reactor was charged with hydrogen gas at a pressure of 2 MPa. The reaction temperature was maintained at 220 °C for 4 h (the temperature increase rate was set to 10 °C/min; the stirring speed was 700 rpm). After the reaction, the catalyst was centrifuged and collected, washed three times with dodecane, and then tested for cyclicity. The conversion of palmitic acid (Eq. (1)) and the selectivity of pentadecane (Eq. (2)) were identified and calculated by GC–MS, and the quantitative analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GC-2014C gas chromatograph. The reaction rate was calculated using (Eq. (3)) and the apparent activation energies of the two steps were calculated by (Eq. (4)) (1) Conversion ( % ) = n p a l m i t i c a c i d , t 0 − n p a l m i t i c a c i d , t n p a l m i t i c a c i d , t 0 × 100 (2) Selectivity ( % ) = n p r o d u c t , t n p r o d u c t , a l l × 100 (3) k ( m o l · g − 1 · h − 1 ) = n p a l m i t i c a c i d , t 0 − n p a l m i t i c a c i d , t ( m o l ) m c a t a l y s t ( g ) × Δ t ( h ) (4) d l n k d T = E a R T 2 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterizations The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ni x Co y Al-LDHs precursors synthesized through hydrothermal method shows obvious hydrotalcite-like compounds (JCPDS: 51–0045), with the existence of (003), (006), (009) and (012) characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 11.50, 23.10, 34.59 and 38.89°, respectively (Fig. 1 a) [34,35]. After a thermal reduction treatment in a H2 atmosphere at 600 °C, Ni x Co y Al-LDHs were transformed into NiCo bimetallic alloy (Fig. 1b). For the single-crystal Ni-600 sample, the main diffraction peak at 44.50° is identified as the Ni (111) crystal plane. As the Co content increases, the diffraction peaks for three catalysts Ni4Co1, Ni1Co1, and Ni1Co4 shift to a lower angle gradually and all peaks are located between those of Ni (JCPDS 04–0850) and Co (JCPDS 15–0806), indicating Single-phase alloy NiCo nanoparticles are formed [34,36]. H2-TPR experiment was carried out to explore the reducibility of the catalysts and the metal interactions. As shown in Fig. 1c, a broad peak appears at ∼480 °C, which is attributed to the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni. With the introduction of Co, a new peak appears at the low temperature range of 200–225 °C, which belongs to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+. The peak at 580–600 °C in the high temperature range belongs to the co-reduction peak of Ni and Co [37,38]. Notably, the reduction peak of Ni1Co1–600 exhibits the most significant shift towards lower temperatures. The morphologies of the reduced samples (Ni-600, Ni4Co1–600, Ni1Co1–600 and Ni1Co4–600) were investigated by SEM. The four samples all present the flower-like morphology with a diameter of ∼1.8–2 μm nanocrystals, which retained well with the LDHs precursor (Fig. S1). TEM images (Fig. 2 a1-a4) show uniformly dispersed high-density nanoparticles with particle sizes of 23.32 nm, 23.76 nm, 24.98 nm and 26.07 nm for Ni-600, Ni4Co1–600, Ni1Co1–600 and Ni1Co4–600 [39]. HRTEM images (Fig. 2b1-b4) show clear lattice spacing, which was measured after IFFT transformation (Fig. 2c1–4), corresponding to Ni (d111 = 0.203 nm), Ni4Co1 alloy (d111 = 0.204 nm), Ni1Co1 alloy (d111 = 0.205 nm) and Ni1Co4 alloy (d111 = 0.206 nm) [40]. The lattice of the NiCo alloy expands as the Co content increases, which is consistent with the XRD results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be used to study the chemical state of the elements on the surface of a sample. The XPS results for the three alloy samples showed Ni, Co, C and O (Fig. 3 a–b and Figure S2) [36]. The details of the data processing after XPS analysis are given in Table S1. After data analysis and processing, the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p can be decomposed into spin-orbit doublets and satellite peaks (Fig. 3a). The presence of Ni0 is confirmed by the prominent peak of Ni 2p3/2 around 852.7 eV, while the peak around 855.8 eV indicates the coexistence of Ni oxide. The exposure of the sample to atmospheric conditions caused partial oxidation of the outer surface, which is the reason for the oxidised state in the XPS analysis. It is worth noting that, compared with Ni-600, the positive shift of the Ni0 peak in the Ni x Co y sample with increasing Co content indicates that Ni is losing electrons. The transfer of electrons from Ni to Co reveals the formation of an alloy(Table S1) [37]. The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows prominent peaks at 778.3 eV and 781.2 eV, which are assigned to Co0 and Co in the oxidised state, respectively [41]. As the Co content increases, the alloyed Co2p3/2 peaks of Ni x Co y show a negative shift, indicating Co gets electrons from the neighboring Ni atoms. These changes observed in the binding energy of the alloy Ni and Co, confirming the strong electronic interactions between adjacent Ni and Co. The electron transfer in the bimetallic NiCo alloy is the main reason for its excellent synergistic effect. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy can be used to study the complex electronic structure and coordination environment of elements. XAFS analysis was performed on four samples (Fig. 3c-f), and the fitted parameters such as the coordination number were listed in Table S2–3 and Fig. S3–4. The Ni K-edge white line intensity of Ni x Co y closely resembles that of Ni foil (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the average oxidation state of Ni is predominantly zero. Furthermore, the white line signal enhancement with increasing Co content, which can be attributed to the electron diminishment on the Ni atom. Fig. 3d shows the normalized Co K-edge XANES spectra of all alloy samples and the energy absorption edge fell between metallic Co foil and CoO, indicating the co-existence of both metallic and oxidized states. In contrast, the white line signal degradation with increasing Co content, suggesting electron enrichment on the Co atom. This can be attributed to interface electron transfer from the Ni atom to the Co atom in the Ni x Co y -600 sample. Fig. 3e and f show the Fourier transforms of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the four samples in real space. After in situ H2 reduction, the EXAFS spectra of all Ni samples display a dominant peak at ∼2.1 Å, mainly associated with Ni-Ni coordination. In a pure nickel sample, the coordination number (CN) of the dominant Ni-Ni coordination is 8.5, whereas the Ni-Ni coordination number decreases gradually with the rise in Co content and a CN of 7.4 in Ni1Co4 (Figure S3 and Table S2), suggesting that Ni atoms are randomly replaced within NiCo alloy, in line with the HR-TEM observation. As increasing the Co content, the peaks at ∼2.2 Å, assigned to the Co-Co coordination were observed. EXAFS curve fitting shows that the CN of Co-Co coordination in the Ni4Co1, Ni1Co1 and Ni1Co4 samples is 8.2, 7.7 and 7.4, respectively (Fig. S4 and Table S3) [38]. 3.2 Catalytic evaluations Typically, the Hydrodeoxygenation of palmitic acid to prepare alkanes would occur through three reaction pathways (Scheme S1). For path (1), palmitic acid can be converted to pentadecane in one step by decarboxylation (DCO2). In path (2) and (3), the hydrogenation of palmitic acid produces the intermediate hexadecanol, which is then converted to pentadecane by decarbonylation (DCO) or to hexadecane through hydrogenation (direct HDO). The catalytic evaluations for catalysts with different metal ratios toward HDO of palmitic acid are shown in Fig. 4 a. The conversion of palmitic acid (Fig. 4a) over the Ni-600 sample reaches 82.1 % and a substantial quantity of alcohols are produced as the catalytic product, with the selectivity to pentadecane only at 40.0 %. Notably, the Ni1Co1–600 sample exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving a conversion of >99 % for the substrate and a remarkable selectivity of 97.3 % for the pentadecane product, suggesting that the introduction of Co tends to favor the decarbonylation pathway. Moreover, a rise in the Co content resulted in a decrease in conversion, as demonstrated by the Ni1Co4–600 sample, where the conversion rate significantly decreased to 53.9 %. The pristine Co-600 catalyst exhibits a conversion rate of only 40.3 %, suggesting that the catalytic performance of pure Co is notably low. In addition, we investigated the effect of the synthesis method on the catalyst activity. As the results are shown in Table S4, the HDO activity of the Ni1Co1/Al2O3–600 which prepared by wet impregnation was much poor than that of the Ni1Co1–600 obtained with LDHs as precursor by the topological transition method. Ni1Co1–600 catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity for fatty acids and fatty acid esters with different carbon numbers (Table S5). Furthermore, the HDO reaction temperature of Ni1Co1–600 was optimised (Fig. 4b). The conversion in the low temperature range (180–190 °C) is <50 %. As the reaction temperature increases, the conversion of the HDO reaction increases significantly, with a conversion of 99 % and a selectivity of 97.3 % for pentadecane at 220 °C. Through the screening of reaction pressure and solvent (Fig. S6–7), the optimal conditions for the reaction are determined to be a 2 MPa H2 and a solvent of dodecane. Stability tests on the Ni1Co1–600 catalyst (Fig. 4c) shows that the conversion and the selectivity of pentadecane decreases by only 4 % and 2.3 % over nine cycles. The XRD and TEM results of the recycled catalysts (Fig. S8–9) show no significant changes compared to the new catalysts, indicating that the Ni1Co1–600 catalyst has good stability and reusability. In contrast, both the Ni-600 and Co-600 monometallic catalysts show a significant decrease in conversion after 9 cycles (Fig. 4d and Fig. S5a), which emphasizes the importance of bimetallic alloy sites in the HDO reaction. The Ni-600 sample shows a decrease in the conversion of palmitic acid from 82.1 % to 65.0 % and a selectivity to pentadecane of <40 % after 9 cycles. The XRD pattern of the recovered Ni-600 catalyst shows a clear NiO phase (Figure S10), and the TEM image shows an increase in particle size (Figure S11). This indicates that the Ni-600 sample is less stable during the HDO process and is subject to oxidation and agglomeration. Subsequently, the effect of reaction time on product distribution was studied in detail on the Ni1Co1–600 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4e, the substrate palmitic acid gradually decreases and is completely consumed at 4 h A large amount of hexadecanol is observed during the early stage of the reaction. The content of hexadecanol peaks at 1.5 h and begins to decrease. While the content of pentadecane gradually increases to 97 % at 4 h and remains constant. The main product of Co-600 is alkane, but its conversion only reaches 40.3 % in the end (Figure S5b). Comparing the time-dependent change curve of the reaction performance of Ni-600 (Fig. 4f), the conversion reaches a maximum value of 82.1 % at 4 h, and the main product is hexadecanol. There is a slight increasing trend in the content of alkanes as the reaction proceeded, reaching a maximum of 41.0 % and remaining unchanged. Based on the relationship between the product distribution and reaction time, it is speculated that the possible reaction path is (2)Decarbonylation (DCO). In the presence of the Ni1Co1–600 catalyst, the main intermediate in the preparation of pentadecane by the hydrodeoxygenation reaction of palmitic acid (CH3(CH2)14COOH) is hexadecanol. The Co is important in the hydrodeoxygenation of hexadecanol, which can promote the decarbonylation of hexadecanol to pentadecane. Compare with the catalysts reported in recent years (Fig. 4g). It can be seen that this catalytic system has the following two characteristics: On the one hand, the reaction conditions are milder (220 °C, 2 MPa H2, 4 h), which is much lower than most reports (Table S6); On the other hand, it has good recyclability and good stability. 3.3 Catalytic mechanism In the time-dependent product distribution curve, a decrease in hexadecanol accompanied by the formation of pentadecane is observed. Therefore, hexadecanol is an important intermediate in the reaction process. The kinetics of the two steps were studied: the first step is the production of hexadecanol, and the second step is the conversion of hexadecanol to pentadecane. In the process catalyzed by Ni1Co1–600 and Ni-600, all of them contain a good linear relationship between the fitted 1/T and lnk, respectively. The Arrhenius plots ( Fig. 5 a and 5b) in the kinetic region (Table S7–8) were fitted to calculate the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the two steps, and the order is as follows: Ea2 Ni-600 (167.72 kJ/mol) > Ea2 Ni1Co1–600 (145.76 kJ/mol) > Ea1 Ni1Co1–600 (100.26 kJ/mol) > Ea1 Ni-600 (74.47 kJ/mol). Therefore, we believe that the second step of this reaction, the decarbonylation of hexadecanol to form pentadecane is the rate-controlling step. This result corresponds to the performance evaluation of the reaction: the presence of Co reduces the Ea of the step of alcohol decarbonylation to alkane. Propionic acid was used as a probe molecule to investigate the adsorption configuration of the carboxyl group on different catalysts. Pure propionic acid was pumped into the reaction cell at 25 °C, and propionic acid gas was continuously passed for 30 min, followed by purging with helium for 60 min to remove physically adsorbed substrate from the catalyst surface (Fig. 5c). Two obvious absorption bands of gas-phase propionic acid appear, which are a strong absorption band at 1772 and 1737 cm−1 attribute to the C = O group and a weak absorption band at 1150 cm−1 attribute to the OH group. The signal of v(C = O) in Ni1Co1–600 shows a significant red shift from 1772 to 1688 cm−1, and the signal peak shows a weak red shift with an increase in Ni content, indicating stronger chemisorption on the Ni (111) surface. Two vibration bands centered at 1686 and 1431 cm−1 are observed on the surface of the Ni-600 catalyst, which are the stretching vibrations of the C = O and CO bonds in the monodentate adsorption configuration [42]. The signals of v(COO−) appears in Ni1Co1–600 and Co-600 after the incorporation of Co, and the adsorption configuration changes to bidentate adsorption. The difference between vas(COO−) and vs(COO−) in Ni1Co1–600 is 104, indicating the bidentate bridge adsorption mode. The difference between vas(COO−) and vs(COO−) in Co-600 is 76, indicating the bidentate chelation adsorption mode [43]. Fig. 5e shows a schematic diagram of the adsorption structure. In situ Fourier transform infrared measurements of CO adsorption measurements were carried out to compare and explore the CO adsorption characteristics of the alloy catalysts. After He purging, a distinct gas-phase CO adsorption band was observed on all three catalysts. The peaks at 2030 and 1890 cm−1 are attributed to linear bonded CO and bridged adsorbed CO at two adjacent metal atoms, respectively. With the introduction of Co, the absorption band of CO shows a high-frequency shift, and the dipole-dipole forces interaction between adjacent CO species is enhanced. Based on the above catalytic evaluations results, kinetic experiments, and in-situ infrared results, we speculate on the hydrodeoxygenation reaction pathway of fatty acids to form alkanes on a NiCo alloy. As shown in Fig. 6 , fatty acids are combined with a NiCo alloy in the form of a double-bridged adsorption, and after hydrodeoxygenation, an intermediate fatty alcohol is formed [44]. The aliphatic alcohol is then converted by decarbonylation to an alkane with one fewer carbon number [45]. In this process, the formation of the NiCo alloy reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, thereby increasing the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have prepared a NiCo bimetallic alloy catalyst with unique synergistic effects. Compared with previously reported non-noble metal catalysts, the resulting Ni1Co1–600 has excellent catalytic activity (conversion: 99 %; alkane selectivity: 97 %) and mild reaction conditions (220 °C, 2 MPa H2, 4 h), which can be used for the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids to prepare alkanes. For the Ni-600 sample, the adsorption configuration of the fatty acid COO− is monodentate adsorption, resulting in the production of fatty alcohol. Nevertheless, the introduction of Co changes the substrate adsorption configuration to a bidentate bridge adsorption mode, which reduces the activation energy required for the decarbonylation reaction to occur, and the main product changes to alkane. This study explores the structure-activity relationship of the Ni x Co y alloy catalyst, revealing the influence of substrate adsorption modes on the selectivity and pathway of the HDO reaction. Our strategy successfully demonstrates the case of the non-precious metal Ni x Co y alloy as a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids to prepare alkanes.

        "dc:description": "Hydrodeoxygenation is a promising method for producing green diesel from fatty-acid-based biomass. Herein, we have reported NiCo alloy catalyst obtained by reduction of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor, which displays prominent behavior for selective hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids to prepare long-chain alkanes. The optimal Ni1Co1–600 shows catalytic performance (conversion: 99 %; alkanes selectivity: 97 %) in palmitic acid hydrodeoxygenation reaction, with milder conditions compared with previously reported studies on non-precious metal. A combination study including HR-TEM, XAFS and XPS confirms that a strong electron exchange occurs at the NiCo alloy catalys with electron transfer from Ni to Co in the metal. Both kinetic experiments and in situ FT-IR reveal the adsorption configuration of the substrate and the reaction pathway:Firstly, fatty acid is adsorbed at Ni-Co bimetallic sites through carboxyl group in the form of a bidentate bridge adsorption configuration; Then the active site is conducive to the process of decarbonylation of fatty alcohol intermediate to produce alkanes. This versatile catalytic system is poised to expand its applications to a wider array of reactions involving the breakdown of polar chemical bonds.",
