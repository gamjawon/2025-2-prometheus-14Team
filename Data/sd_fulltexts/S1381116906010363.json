Keywords Alumina Methane Hydrogen production Carbon nanotubes 1 Introduction Hydrogen is considered to be the energy carrier of the future and its production is a subject of current interest for fuel cell applications where it is the preferred fuel. For stationary applications, the most convenient source of hydrogen for fuel cells at the present time is natural gas, because of its availability and low cost [1–5]. Among the possible natural gas processing technologies, the direct catalyzed decomposition of methane has recently been receiving attention as an alternative route to the production of CO/CO2-free hydrogen. Unlike other conventional hydrogen production methods, such as methane steam reforming and methane partial oxidation, which produce a mixture of hydrogen and carbon oxides, catalytic cracking produces hydrogen and solid carbon, thereby eliminating the necessity for the separation of hydrogen from the other gaseous products. This significantly simplifies the process, reduces overall CO2 emissions and makes it particularly attractive for fuel cell applications [3–14]. In addition, the decomposition of methane also results in the generation of a very important byproduct, nanocarbon materials (carbon nanotubes and nanofibers), that have been paid considerable attention due to their excellent properties and potential utilizations [15–18]. The potential uses of the nanocarbons depend on their textures and structures; therefore, another goal of the process is to monitor the features of the carbon formed. In previous studies, several catalysts have been proposed to be further considered for practical applications in direct decomposition of methane. Shah et al. [11] presented the results for the catalytic decomposition of undiluted methane into hydrogen and carbon using nanoscale Fe-M (M=Pd, Mo or Ni) catalysts supported on alumina. These binary catalysts reduced the methane decomposition temperature by 400–500°C relative to thermal methane cracking and they were more active than a monometallic 5%Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, the form of carbon produced is different at different decomposition temperatures and in the temperature range where the catalysts were most active; multiwalled carbon nanotubes were the dominant form of carbon produced. Muradov [12] has studied direct cracking of methane over different samples of elemental carbon, including a variety of activated carbons, carbon blacks, nanostructured carbons, graphites, glassy carbon and synthetic diamond powders. It was demonstrated that carbon materials are capable of producing hydrogen-rich gases at moderate temperatures. Although activated carbons are initially more active than carbon blacks, the latter result in a more sustainable process of methane decomposition and the catalytic activity of carbons is mostly determined by their origin and surface properties. Most of the metal supported catalysts for methane decomposition reported until now were prepared by impregnation of commercial supports with a solution of the salt of the active component or by co-precipitation of salts of the active component and a textural promoter. In this context, this paper presents the synthesis of spherical Al2O3 and Ni-doped Al2O3 catalysts with porous structures, containing mainly mesopores, with a high surface area. The synthesis method for the spherical catalysts developed by our group consists of obtaining a hybrid spherical compound of aluminum hydroxide and the organic polymer chitosan. Through the polymer elimination by thermal treatment, a porous Al2O3 sphere is obtained [19]. With the aim of highlighting the enhancement of catalytic properties, the catalysts obtained were tested in the decomposition of methane reaction for hydrogen production. After the catalytic tests, characterization of the deposited carbon was carried out and the results are reported here. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation For the Al2O3 spheres preparation, 1.50g of chitosan (C6H11O4N) n (Aldrich) was dissolved in 50mL of acetic acid solution (5%, v/v) and 4.60g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Riedel-de-Haën) were dissolved in 20mL of distilled water. The Al aqueous solution was then added to the polymer solution with stirring. The chitosan monomer to Al molar ratio was 1.5–2. The Al–chitosan solution was added into a NH4OH solution (50%, v/v) under vigorous stirring, in the form of drops with a syringe pump. The gel spheres formed were removed from the NH4OH solution and dried at ambient temperature for 72h. The nickel addition (5wt.%) was carried out by impregnation of an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Fluka, 98%) on the Al2O3 spheres with stirring for 6h. The samples with nickel were dried at ambient temperature for 24h. The Al2O3 (Al2O3#350, Al2O3#550 and Al2O3#700) and Ni/Al2O3 (Ni/Al2O3#550 and Ni/Al2O3#700) samples were obtained by calcining the dried samples at 350, 550 and 700°C in air flow for 1h with a heating rate of 5°C/min. 2.2 Sample characterization Samples were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms obtained at the temperature of liquid nitrogen in an automated physisorption instrument (Autosorb-1C, Quantachrome Instruments). Prior to the measurement, the samples were outgassed in vacuum at 200°C for 2h. Specific surface areas were calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distributions were obtained according to the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption data. For the determination of the Ni content an atomic spectrometer (Varian Model SpectrAA 50), equipped with an air–acetylene flame atomizer and a Hitachi hollow cathode lamp (HLA-4S) was used. The instrument parameters were: wavelength 232nm, slit width 1.0nm, lamp current 4mA, aspiration rate 5mL/min and fuel acetylene with support air. The standard solutions for the Ni ion were prepared through appropriate dilution of a stock solution (Merck) containing 1000ppm. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was performed in a quartz reactor under 5vol.% H2/N2 flow (30mL/min) from 30 to 920°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the H2 consumption. A PM5A column trapped water formed during the process. The crystalline phases (of freshly prepared catalysts and their reduced forms) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a Siemens D-5000, with graphite monochromated Cu Kα irradiation. The sample morphology was observed with scanning electron micrographs, obtained with a Philips XL30 scanning microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 20kV. 2.3 Catalyst testing The decomposition reaction of CH4 (Scheme 1 ) was carried out in a quartz-tube fixed bed flow reactor (12mm inner diameter) heated by an electric furnace. The Ni/Al2O3 spheres (100mg), heat-treated at 550 and 700°C, were pre-treated in situ in a H2 stream at 700°C (with a heating rate of 10°C/min) for 1h. The experiments were conducted under atmospheric pressure at 600, 700 and 800°C. The reaction gas was composed of N2 and CH4 in a 6:1 molar ratio. The total flow rate of the reaction gas was 70mL/min. The reactant and the product gases were analyzed with a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph, equipped with a TCD, Porapak-Q and a 5A molecular sieve column with Ar as the carrier gas. The N2 in the reaction gas was used as a diluent and as an internal analysis standard. Catalytic activity was evaluated in terms of methane conversion. We defined methane conversion as: (1) C ( C H 4 ) = Q conv Q C H 4 × 100 % where Q conv represents the quantity (moles) of converted methane; Q C H 4 represents the total quantity (moles) of methane fed into the reactor. 2.4 Sample characterization after catalyst testing The specific surface areas of the samples used were calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the pore volumes were obtained according to the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption data. The structure, texture and morphology of the deposited carbon were characterized by means of Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw Raman System 3000) at room temperature. Spectra were recorded using the 632.2nm excitation line of a Spectra Physics He–Ne laser. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained in a Philips CM 200 microscope operating at 200kV. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained with a Philips SEM-505 scanning microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 20kV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysts characterization The spheres were heat-treated at 350, 550 and 700°C under airflow for 1h. After calcinations at 350°C, the Al2O3 sample had a black colour, indicating the presence of residual carbon. On the other hand, the samples heat-treated at 550 and 700°C had a white colour and for the Ni/Al2O3 samples a light green colour was observed after the heat-treatment, which indicates the elimination of carbon at high temperatures (550 and 700°C). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the Al2O3 samples heat-treated at 550 and 700°C show type-IV (IUPAC) curves, pointing to the mesoporous material. By contrast, the Al2O3 sample heat-treated at 350°C shows a microporous isotherm (Fig. 1a). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the Ni/Al2O3 samples (Fig. 1b) indicate a change in the patterns due to nickel addition. The profile suggests a change from a mesoporous to a macroporous material and lowering of the surface areas (Table 1 ). The pore size distributions of the samples (Fig. 2 ) confirm the presence of micropores for the sample heat treated at 350°C, but with an increase in the calcination temperature mesopore formation is significantly favored. This behaviour is attributed to carbon elimination at the higher treatment temperatures. With a heat treatment at 350°C, the amount of residual material is still high. However, as summarized in Table 1, the higher surface area and the lower total pore volume of the sample heat treated at 350°C may be due to the small pore size. The residual carbon elimination by heating at 550 and 700°C resulted in a surface area decrease and thus, the residual carbon is thought to contribute significantly to a higher surface area. On the other hand, the carbon elimination promoted a great increase in the total pore volume, which suggests that the residual carbon present within the pores of the crystalline matrix is an amorphous carbon with high surface area. Burning off the residual carbon generated pores, which leads to mesopore formation and an increase in the total pore volume. The Ni doped Al2O3 sphere samples also presented a high surface area and pore volume. However, as shown in Table 1, these values were lower than those for the Al2O3 samples. The comparison of pore size distributions of Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 (Fig. 2a and b) shows clearly a difference in their pore sizes. The presence of nickel promoted the obtention of a sphere with meso- and macropores. Such a change in the pore size distribution cannot be attributed totally to the pore closing due to the NiO. As indicated by the hysteresis of the isotherms in Fig. 1b, the pore shapes of the Ni/Al2O3 samples appear to be slitlike. The presence of nickel promotes faster carbon elimination and such behaviour certainly affects the type of pores formed during the heat-treatment [19,20]. With the aim of identifying the phases present in the catalytic samples, X-ray diffraction and TPR analysis were carried out. Despite the NiAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3 peaks being overlaid, in the XRD results of the freshly prepared catalysts presented in Fig. 3a the profiles show the NiAl2O4 formation, which is clearer for the sample heat treated at 700°C. The XRD results also indicate the presence of the NiO phase. This suggests the possibility of obtaining catalytic sites with different properties after the activation. The shifts in the peaks at 2θ =45° and 66° are greater for the Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 700°C due to the presence of NiAl2O4, which means that the NiAl2O4 phase formation is greater for this sample. Fig. 3b shows the results of the XRD analysis of the reduced form of the catalysts. For the Ni/Al2O3#550 catalyst there were more intense diffraction peaks related to the crystalline planes (111), (200) and (222) of the Ni, in comparison to the Ni/Al2O3#700 catalyst, indicating that the Ni/Al2O3#550 catalyst can be reduced more easily. In addition, a decrease in the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the crystalline planes of the Ni was observed for the Ni/Al2O3#700 catalyst due to the presence of a strong metal–support interaction resulting from the high temperature of the heat treatment applied to the material. The determination of reducible species at the surface of the catalyst and the temperature at which these species are reduced, gives important information on catalysis. The H2 consumption peak near 530°C and the shoulder near 630°C in the TPR profile (Fig. 4 ) for the Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 550°C are due to the presence of NiO. For the Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 700°C, H2 consumption was observed at these temperatures but it was significantly lower, indicating that there is less NiO in this sample than in the sample heat treated at 550°C. The Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 700°C gave a wide range of H2 consumption, beginning at 450°C until the final temperature of the process. However, the maximum H2 consumption peak was observed at 830°C, which is characteristic of the NiAl2O4 phase, indicating a greater metal–support interaction, promoted by the calcination temperature applied to the material. This observation is in agreement with the XRD profile, which indicates the presence of the NiO and NiAl2O4 phases. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out in order to observe the typical morphologies of the samples obtained. The SEM images presented in Fig. 5a and b show the Al2O3 spheres heat-treated at 550°C before the catalyst tests. The SEM image presented in Fig. 5a shows a pore diameter size quite different to that determined by the N2 adsorption isotherm, but it can illustrate the morphology, which is due to the utilization of organic precursor in the catalyst preparation. During the pyrolysis step the elimination of volatile materials occurs, which produces cavities as a result of their removal. At the same time, a solid rearrangement takes place, forming the crystalline matrix. 3.2 Catalyst testing In order to investigate the catalytic activity of the Ni/Al2O3 spheres (Ni/Al2O3 heat treated at 550°C and Ni/Al2O3 heat treated at 700°C) the decomposition reaction of methane was carried out. All tests were conducted under identical experimental conditions and the reactions were run for 90min. No methane decomposition products other than hydrogen were detected in the effluent gas during the experiments, thus carbon and hydrogen can be regarded as the only products of methane decomposition, that is, only the following reaction occurs during the process: (2) CH4 →C+2H2 ΔH°=75.6kJ/mol Fig. 6 shows the general performance of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts on methane decomposition at different temperatures (600, 700 and 800°C). Over both Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, the initial conversion values of methane decomposition increase as the temperature increases. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C, at a reaction temperature of 700°C, showed the highest initial activity on methane decomposition while that for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 700°C with a reaction temperature of 600°C was the lowest. High initial decomposition values presented by both Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were followed by a rapid drop in catalytic activity, reaching a quasi-steady-state rate (over 10–20min) which remained stable for several minutes. This behaviour may be related to the carbon deposition that promotes a blocking of the active surface [10,17]. During the catalytic decomposition reaction, methane molecules are initially adsorbed and decomposed on the metal surface of the catalyst particle, resulting in the formation of chemisorbed carbon species and the release of gaseous hydrogen; the carbon species proceed to dissolve and diffuse through the bulk of the metal particle. Deactivation occurs when the rate of carbon diffusion through the metal catalyst particle is slower than that of the formation of carbon at the surface of the Ni0 sites. Under these circumstances, carbon builds up at the catalyst surface and eventually encapsulates the metal particle that causes activity loss [17,18]. However, it is interesting to note that the activity is different for different catalysts, the activity being dependent on the catalyst and reaction temperature. For example, the CH4 conversion presented by the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C, at a reaction temperature of 800°C, remains near 20% higher than that of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 700°C, at the same reaction temperature, after 20min of time-on-stream. This behaviour may be related to the formation of catalytic sites with different characteristics on the surface of the samples (confirmed by TPR and XRD analyses) promoted by the different calcination temperatures to which the material was exposed. The commonly accepted mechanism for methane decomposition over nickel catalysts includes stages of activation and decomposition of methane on the metal surface. The reaction starts with the dissociative adsorption of the methane molecule on the surface of the active sites [6]: (3) (CH4)g →(CH3)a +(H)a This is followed by a series of stepwise surface dissociation reactions leading to elemental carbon and hydrogen: (4) (CH3−x )a →(CH2−x )a +(H)a (5) ( C ) a → 1 n ( C n ) c ( carbon crystalline growth ) (6) 2(H)a →(H2)g, where, 0< x <2, subscripts (a), (c) and (g) denote adsorbed, crystalline and gaseous species, respectively. From the results of Fig. 3b, one can see that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C shows the largest relative intensity of Ni (111), (200) and (222) planes, which may be the reason why it shows the highest capacity for methane decomposition. In this sense, the active phase is more accessible (or evident) in the Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 550°C; as a consequence the catalyst is able to maintain its high activity. In the presence of Ni, the catalyst becomes more active and the active metal site is responsible for the breaking of the CH bonds in the CH4 cleavage to produce H2. On the other hand, the NiAl2O4 phase formation (indicating a greater metal–support interaction) presented by the Ni/Al2O3 sample heat treated at 700°C decreases the concentration of the active component in the catalyst and this is presumed to difficult methane adsorption on the metal surface of the catalyst particle. This phenomenon may be responsible for the low CH4 conversion observed over this catalyst. 3.3 Sample characterization after catalyst tests The changes in the surface properties, including pore properties and surface images were measured for the fresh and used Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Some of their surface properties are summarized in Table 2 and the SEM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 5c–f. For both catalysts, the BET surface areas are all significantly reduced after reaction in the methane stream. For example, the BET surface area of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C, after a reaction at temperature of 800°C, decreases from 270 to 156m2/g. This may be related to it showing the highest activity during the methane decomposition that leads to the greatest decrease in surface area. The pore volume also decreases for both catalysts after the decomposition reaction. These phenomena result from the carbon deposition especially in the pores of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, which contribute greatly to the surface area and pore volume characteristics of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. These observations are confirmed by the SEM images that show the changes in the surface of the Ni/Al2O3 samples after catalyst tests (shown in Fig. 5c and d), where carbon deposition is clearly seen on the sample surface. Also, the carbon produced using the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts was of different types distinguished by the naked eye. A part of the carbon deposition is in the form of carbon filaments and another part is in an irregular agglomerate form. The TEM images of the Ni/Al2O3 samples heat treated at 550°C after catalytic testing at 700°C (Fig. 5e and f) indicate abundant carbon nanotubes growing out of the Ni particles. The carbon nanotubes grow in a random direction and tend to take the form of arcs. The Raman spectra of the catalysts after the catalytic tests are shown in Fig. 7 . The spectra present bands originated from carbon structures. A band at 1587cm−1 is due to the tangential CC stretching (G mode); another at 1321cm−1 is the D mode, attributed to disordered carbon structures, present in carbon nanotubes or other carbon forms, with its overtone at 2609cm−1. The Raman spectra of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C, after the catalytic tests at 700 and 800°C, and the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 700°C, after the catalytic tests at 800°C, show the presence of a low frequency band near 188cm−1, attributed to the radial breathing mode (RBM) of the carbon nanotubes, characteristic of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) [21], however, with a low degree of purity, as can be inferred from the low relative intensity of the G and D bands (IG/ID), of approximately 2. It is known that the higher intensity IG/ID ratio, the more perfect and purer are the SWNTs [21,22]. For the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 700°C, after the catalytic tests at 600 and 700°C, the spectra indicate only the presence of multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) or other carbon forms, because of the negligible intensity of the RBM. The absence of SWNTs for this catalyst may be related to the presence of catalytic sites with different properties on the surface of this sample mainly due to the more intense NiAl2O4 phase presence. In this case, the active phase (Ni0) is expected to be less accessible (or available) and the growth of the carbon nanotubes would be inhibited. These results suggest that the mechanism of carbon deposition on the Ni/Al2O3#550 catalyst is different from that on the Ni/Al2O3#700 catalyst. It is generally agreed that diffusion of carbon through the catalyst particle is the rate-determining step in the growth of nanocarbons [17]. Therefore, according to the above results, the diffusion of carbon is affected not only by the reaction temperature but also by the fraction of Ni0 sites on the surface of the catalysts. The growth condition for SWNTs is a bit more rigorous than that for MWNTs, which need a higher temperature and are more dependent on the characteristics of the catalytic sites. 4 Conclusions It was observed that the methodology used in the preparation of Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 spheres led to the obtention of materials with important properties for applications in catalytic processes, such as decomposition of methane. The results clarify that the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were active and stable in relation to the decomposition of methane reaction for the production of hydrogen. This process produces CO/CO2-free hydrogen in a single step, which is a very attractive feature for fuel cell applications and tests with the objective of evaluating the catalytic stability of the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts are being carried out. Carbon, as a valuable byproduct of the process, could potentially significantly reduce the net cost of hydrogen production. After the catalytic tests, we carried out the characterization of the deposited carbon by TEM, SEM and Raman spectroscopy. The analyses indicated the presence of SWNTs and MWNTs. It was observed that the production of SWNTs and MWNTs is dependent on the characteristics of the sites present on the surface of the catalyst and on the reaction temperature. The quantity of SWNTs produced is much higher for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 550°C than for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst heat treated at 700°C, that presented mainly the formation of MWNTs and amorphous carbon. However, we believe that in the near future, the production of SWNTs by decomposition of CH4 over the catalysts developed by our group will be optimized to obtain SWNTs with high quality.
