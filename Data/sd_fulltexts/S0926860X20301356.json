Graphical abstract A composite of zeolite Y type -graphene as a support doped with molybdenum-cobalt and molybdenum-nickel (active phase and promoter) was synthesized and evaluated as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. The ZGMoCo was found to have the ability to reduce the sulfur content by ≈98 % after a 5 h reaction time which is higher compared to the ZMoCo or ZMoNi. This activity can be ascribed to the improved surface area and better distribution of the active phases (molybdenum and cobalt or nickel) on the zeolite Y type -graphene surface. SEM images showed enhanced dispersion of the active phases on the support surface. As per the BET measurements, the surface area was improved due to the introduction of graphene to be 323.6 m2/g ZGMoCo compared to 257.3 m2/g ZMoCo; and 312.5 m2/g for ZGMoNi compared to 245.7 m2/g for ZMoNi. The work offers a convenient approach to prepare an effective HDS catalyst. Keywords Zeolite Graphene Dibenzothiophene Distribution Hydrodesulfurization 1 Introduction Environmental concerns related to the fuel specifications with ultra-low sulfur content became an important approach to prevent air pollution caused by sulfur dioxide emission. Nowadays, the demand for deep desulfurization has become a requirement to meet the regulations for sulfur in petroleum products [1–4]. Recently, sulfur content reduction in diesel fuel and gasoline by using catalytic hydrotreating has become a very intensive research area. Environmental regulation suggested that the sulfur contents in diesel and gasoline should be lowered to be 10−15 ppm [5–7]. In the refinery processes, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) has been used extensively to reduce sulfur-containing contents in petroleum. The use of hydrodesulfurization catalysts has attracted researchers owing to their good catalytic activities, product longevity, and selectivity. As a result, HDS catalysts are required to meet the specifications of sulfur during fuel transportation. Previous studies demonstrated the removal of refractory molecules like 4,6 dimethyl dibenzothiophene (4,6 DMDBT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) which present the greatest challenge to get sulfur at ultra-low levels [8]. A highly efficient HDS catalyst with excellent properties towards desulfurization is a challenge [9–11]. The catalyst support is an important factor due to its catalytic performance [12]. To improve the hydrotreating performance of the catalyst, researchers tested zeolite and alumina. This showed that these acidic materials that contain alumina and silica mixture have a better surface area for the dispersion of metals and high concentrations of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites compared to alumina. As a result, zeolites were used extensively as a support for CoMo and NiMo [13]. The presence of a hydrogenating strong acid site has a synergetic effect, not only for accelerating the C–S bond cleavage but also for enhancing different ways of sulfur atom removal from the aromatic molecules. The microporous natural system of zeolites has a role, which limits its applications in the bulky molecules' hydrotreating field. Subsequently, the need to obtain a synthesized material with Bronsted acid sites and more surface area became of great interest [14]. Zeolite as a catalyst support is promising in the petroleum refining industry [15] because of its hierarchical structure, micro-mesoporous nature, and acid-base properties that can be changed using synthesis methods. Zeolite was used as an adsorbent due to its capacity for ionic exchange besides its role in catalysis as a support for the dispersal of the catalyst nanoparticles [16]. Zeolite also has a role to provide acidity to the catalyst structure while the finely dispersed metal nanoparticles are used to exert hydrogenation-dehydrogenation activity. A large variety of applications are present for noble metals supported by zeolite such as the production of high-octane gasoline throughout the hydroisomerization of C5-C6 n-paraffins [17,18] Also, these types of catalysts can be used in the hydrocracking process depending on the obtained product, the partial pressure of the sulphurated contaminants and the feedstock types [19]. Many types of zeolite were also included as subjects to be studied like zeolite beta (BEA) and Y zeolite-based catalyst due to their good properties as a surface for catalyst dispersion [20–23]. Supports modified with carbon such as monocarboxylic acid and citric acid have been reported to synthesize supported active metal catalysts [24,25]. These types of surface modification used to be an effective alternative way, besides the used ones [26]. For example, the intrinsic role of citric acid includes its ability to partly change to carbonaceous deposits during the sulfidation, decreasing the WS2 slab length. It may also react with basic and neutral hydroxyl groups to moderate the interactions between the active phase and the support. The stability and catalytic performance of catalysts can be enhanced through the incorporation of nanocatalysts within suitable conductive materials. It avoids the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and accelerates charge transfer. Nickel and cobalt-based catalysts have been implemented in various applications such as HER and OER and it was used extensively as a promoter in desulfurization processes. These materials are of low cost with facile fabrication processes [27–29]. Graphene has a two-dimensional single sheet of carbon atoms distributed in a hexagonal network. It has a plate-like structure with a one-atom-thick material [30]. Due to its properties, such as a high surface area and excellent mechanical properties, it has been used in different applications like batteries, solar cells, and composite materials, as well as catalysts [31]. One of the most characteristic features of graphene is its large specific surface area. Other properties such as mechanical, thermal and electronic features have made graphene an attractive substrate for the dispersion and deposition of nanoparticles to obtain a composite catalyst [32,33]. Recently, catalysts that use graphene as a support have become a hot area of interest [34]. Both graphene and zeolite have been implemented in various applications such as their good ability towards the molecular dye adsorption from aqueous solution. The composite fabrication for effective separation should be with a hierarchical porous structure based on zeolite or graphene. It became a promising approach for hazardous substances removal [33–38]. Also, the combination between zeolite and graphene was used extensively for the electrochemical detection of various compounds like dopamine and ascorbic acid [39] and as invitro drug carrier for anticancer drug [40]. Catalyst structure, surface atomic arrangement, and coordination are very sensitive parameters involved in catalytic reactions. Control of these parameters occurred by tuning the morphology, composition and catalyst size. The catalytically active components are bonded to support with a large surface area like alumina, zeolite, and others to confirm its dispersion on the support surface [41–44]. Different alternative supports have been used for HDS reactions such as MgO [5], SiO2 [8], ZrO2 [12], Al2O3 [4], and mixed oxides [5]. The role of supports to disperse the active phases on its surface has still not been thoroughly investigated [6]. Here, zeolite Y type - molybdenum- nickel (cobalt) (ZMoNi or ZMoCo) and Zeolite Y type -graphene/ molybdenum- nickel (cobalt) (ZGMoNi or ZGMoCo) were synthesized to illustrate the effective role of graphene for enhancing the catalyst activity. The performance of the synthesized catalyst has been investigated in catalytic reactions using desulfurization of dibenzothiophene. The structural and morphological properties of the prepared catalyst and the role of graphene for improving the catalyst activity were characterized by different techniques. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Commercial zeolite Y type, polyvinylpyrrolidone (C6H9NO)n, decalin (>99 % purity), dibenzothiophene (DBT) (98 %), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (98 %), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (98 %), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (98 %), and ethanol (99 %) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Eschenstrasse, Taufkirchen, Germany. De-ionized water with high purity distilled with a Labstrong FiSTREEM™ II 2S Glass Still distiller, USA and acquired in-house using Thermo-Scientific Barnstead Nanopure. 2.2 Preparation of the catalyst Composite support of zeolite Y type -graphene (ZG) was obtained by mixing graphene dispersed in water and commercial zeolite (Y type). The sol-gel method has been used to mix around 20 mg of graphene dispersed in water with 6.4 g of zeolite. During this process, 100 mL of deionized water and 0.2 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to enhance the interaction between the two supports beside its role for dispersing the active phase and 10 mL ethanol was added to ZG. The stirring of the composite support was for 1 h and refluxing 5 h at 110 °C. After cooling, the filtration was performed and the product was then dried at 90 °C. The incipient wetness impregnation procedure was used for adding the active phases of molybdenum (Mo) and cobalt (Co) or nickel (Ni) nanoparticles to the support with ratios of 15 % Mo and 5 % Co (Ni), respectively. The selection of these percentages for the active phases was decided after a literature survey and it was found that Co (Ni) was from 1 to 5 % and the catalyst was from 8 to 15 % [7]. A solution of cobalt nitrate (1.97 g) and ammonium molybdate (2.43 g) was prepared. Also, around 5.53 g of ZG support dispersed in 0.1 L of deionized water was kept under stirring at 90 °C for 30 min. This is followed by mixing the catalysts solutions with ZG support under stirring at 100 °C for 5 h. Then, the catalyst was filtered and dried at 100 °C. Catalyst calcination in a pure nitrogen medium occurred at 350 °C for 3 h. When synthesizing the reference catalysts ZMoCo or ZMoNi, the same steps were used without the incorporation of graphene for comparison. Here, we should mention an important process during catalyst work which is the sulfidation process. It occurred within the reactor where molybdenum sulfidation happened after the temperature reached to optimum 300 °C that took around 3 h. 2.3 Characterization techniques used for catalysts Several techniques were used for structural and morphology characterization. The textural properties of the catalysts including surface area, pore size distribution and pore volumes were measured by Micromeritics TriStar II PLUS surface area. Sample degassing before measurement at 150 °C for 3 h was performed to remove moistures and gases. Then, the isotherm curves N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 °C were obtained. The surface area was calculated from BET method while total pore volume was obtained by nitrogen adsorption and the pore size was attained from BJH method and its adsorption isotherm. Function groups of the catalysts were characterized by Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. A very small quantity of the material was mixed with KBr powder to prepare a thin translucent disc for measurement. The background noises correction was done using 16 scans with resolution 2 cm−1. Crystallinity was recorded using Rigaku Mini-flex II x-ray diffraction (XRD). The radiation of Cu-Kα was used in the 2θ range (5−80°) and detector angular speed of 2° /min and step size of 0.02°. The surface morphology was recorded using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with mode name JEOL e JSM6610LV. A backscattered electron (BSE) and a secondary electron (SE) mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV were used. The elemental composition and sample mapping were measured with the attached Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Oxford Inc.) detector. Catalysts' thermal stability at high temperature was investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a model name of Q600 Thermal Analyzer Instrument. The sample heating started from ambient temperature up to 900 °C using Platinum/ Platinum Rhodium (Type R) thermocouples. The binding energies and chemical states were measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a model name PHI 5000 Versa Probe II, ULVAC-PHI Inc. spectroscope. A high vacuum for the disc pelletized form of the catalyst was applied before the XPS analysis start. The sample components were defined through gas chromatography-mass spectrometric technique (GCMS) with model name Shimadzu GC17A/GC14C using quadrupole ion-trap analyzer, ions with m/z values orbits around the cavity. 2.4 Assessment of the catalysts A batch reactor (model 4848B) from Parr instruments co. Moline, Illinois USA, was used to assess the catalyst activity (ZMoNi, ZMoCo, ZGMoNi, and ZGMoCo) towards the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene. Decalin acted as a solvent model fuel for dissolving DBT to make a feedstock solution for HDS of DBT that has 0.5 % of sulfur. The catalytic reaction conditions were 55 bars for hydrogen partial pressure and 300 °C as a reaction temperature. About 0.6 g of the synthesized catalysts interacted with 0.1 L decalin and 550 ppm-S DBT. The reaction started when inserting the mixture into the vessel of the reactor. A collection of six samples and a zero point (first sample) was taken after the temperature of the reaction reached 300 °C. Reaction monitoring during 5 h was mandatory with collecting a sample every hour by a manual valve. The determination of the sulfur concentration for the collected samples was carried out by a gas-chromatography sulfur chemiluminescence detector (GC–SCD), (column: J&W 123–1033 - DB-1, 30 m, 0.32 mm, 1.00um). Agilent Stevens Creek Blvd. Santa Clara, United States. GC–MS technique was implemented to illustrate the components of the synthesized catalysts. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physico-chemical properties The N2 sorption isotherms and distribution of pore size of the catalysts were conducted, Fig. S1. The textural properties of the catalysts are illustrated in Table 1 . Incorporation of graphene within zeolite Y type to form composite support increased the surface area from 245.7 m2 g−1 (ZMoNi) to 312.5 m2 g−1 (ZGMoNi) and from 257.3 m2 g-1 (ZMoCo) to 323.6 m2 g-1 (ZGMoCo) and. This improvement in the surface area enhances the activity of the catalysts. Also, the improvement was attributed to the quantity of graphene after parameter optimization for commercialization purposes. The isotherm curves are like type IV. At a high value of relative pressure, there is a hysteresis loop which clarifies the mesoporous nature of the material, while the nitrogen uptake at low pressures indicated the microporous existence within the catalysts. Therefore, graphene improved the textural properties of the catalysts that lead to an enhanced activity towards the hydrodesulfurization of benzothiophenes. It was found the slight change in the textural properties of the catalyst ZGMoCo after HDS reaction that prove the stability of the catalyst. The hierarchy factor (HF) was also calculated to illustrate the role of graphene on the textural properties of the catalysts as: (1) HF = (Vmicro/Vtotal) ∗ (Smeso/SBET) By replacing these parameters in Eq. (1), the HF was obtained. It was shown that the HF values for ZGMoNi and ZGMoCo are higher than the reference sample ZMoNi and ZMoCo which clarifies their higher adsorption efficiency [8]. The quantity adsorbed-desorbed for catalysts was always higher than the reference one at any relative pressure value, which supports our results regarding HF. The incorporation of graphene into the catalyst component has a crucial effect on its stability. TGA curves, Fig. S2, indicated that in the temperature range 0−900 °C and inert gas medium, it is obvious that the weight loss for the ZMoNi reference sample was 17 % at 400 °C and 27 % at 800 °C, while for ZGMoNi, it was 13 % at 400 °C and was reduced by only 4 % up to 800 °C. In addition, the weight loss for ZMoCo was 14.6 % at 400 °C and 23 % up to 800 °C, compared to ZGMoCo which was 11 % and 18 % for the same temperature scale. The total decomposition rate of ZGMoNi and ZGMoCo after 800 °C was 18.9 % and 17 %, which is better than the reference ones (ZMoNi and ZMoCo) that were 22.5 % and 27 %. These results reflected the enhanced thermal stability of the synthesized catalyst after graphene incorporation into the zeolite Y type. The XRD patterns for the synthesized catalysts, Fig. S3, indicated that the characteristic peak at 2θ = 27.3° (100) was attributed to MoO3 according to JCPDS card no. 05-0508. Peaks at 2θ = 6.3° (002), 19.2° (006), 21.3° (101), 24.6° (104), 32.7° (108), 35.6° (112) can be assigned to zeolite material that appeared in the four catalysts. No clear peaks for the active phases Mo and Co (Ni) could be due to their enhanced dispersion on the composite support surface which is consistent with the nitrogen adsorption-desorption results. In the modified catalyst, no diffraction peak for graphene appeared in the curve, which may be due to the low diffraction intensity of graphene and its low amount [9]. In the FTIR patterns, Fig. S4, reveal a slightly small peak at ≈ 3600 cm−1 was ascribed to the bridging OH group in Al−OH-Si [8,10]. The observed peaks at 486 and 1086 cm-1 were related to the Mo = O central vibrational mode [13]. Bands in the range of 450−1000 cm-1 indicated good dispersion of the active phases on the composite support surface [11]. The band at 1566 cm-1 maybe for the OH bending mode. The catalysts’ surface morphologies and their elemental compositions were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fig. 1 illustrates the SEM images for the four catalysts. The surface modification by graphene doping enhanced the dispersion of the active phases Mo and Co (Ni) on the composite support surface. Images of ZGMoCo and ZGMoNi (5e-h) show a better distribution of the catalyst and promoter on the catalyst support surface and the role of graphene sheets for enhancing the surface area. From these images, graphene sheets are present beside the zeolite support. In comparison to the reference samples, it was noticed in the ZMoNi and ZMoCo images (5 a-d), that the dispersion of the active phase is poor and not homogenous [18]. The catalyst SEM image was presented in (5 i-j) and it does not show a big difference from the catalyst before HDS reactions. EDX spectra were used to confirm the presence of elements introduced into the catalysts’ composition. The existence of all the elements Al, Si, Co, Mo, and nickel were confirmed in the reference samples, Fig. 1, while the carbon element attributed to the graphene incorporation. Consequently, we successfully introduced support and active phases into the four catalysts. HRSEM and mapping were utilized to evaluate the distribution and introduction of the components in the ZGMoCo catalyst, Fig. 2 . It was shown that all the components have been induced within the catalyst with a homogenous dispersion. The surface study regarding chemical states and binding energies of the catalyst components was discussed using XPS in Fig. 3 , and Table 2 . The fully scanned spectrum proved the presence of many elements in the synthesized catalyst. Some insights and identification for the degree of Mo species sulfidation [39]. The characteristic binding energies of Mo oxide species were illustrated as per deconvoluted XPS spectra. The spectra confirmed the presence of MoO2 (Mo4+ (3d5/2)) and MoO3 (Mo6+(3d5/2) and Mo6+(3d3/2) at 230.3 eV, 232.7 eV and 235.8 eV respectively. The peaks in the range 775−786 eV was related to Co2p [41,42]. The characteristic peak for C1s which is located at 284.7 eV reflected the graphitized structure [43]. The peak at 529 eV was attributed to O1s that contribute to Mo-O and O of MoO3 exists in the form of O−2 [44]. 3.2 Catalysts activity towards HDS Figs. 4 and 5 show the sulfur conversion in ppm for 5 h reaction time and the percent of this value for the mentioned four catalysts. The reaction parameters used for DBT desulfurization were 300 °C temperature, H2 partial pressure of 55 bar, rotation of 190 rpm, catalyst amount (0.6 g), and 0.1 L model fuel. It was noted that after 5 h, the sulfur concentration for the reference samples ZMoNi and ZMoCo were 66.3 and 55.8 ppm, respectively, while the modified catalyst showed enhanced sulfur removal to be 16.7 and 11.2 ppm for ZGMoNi and ZGMoCo respectively. The conversion percentage for the catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 5. It was 89.8 %, 91.4 %, 97.5 and 98.3 % for ZMoNi, ZMoCo, ZGMoNi and ZGMoCo, respectively, Table S1,2. The improvement in the surface area of the catalyst after the incorporation of graphene has a crucial role in increasing the catalytic activity. Also, the HF calculation and adsorption-desorption isotherm supported our conclusion regarding the activity. All the textural properties like pore volume and surface area with average pore diameter were enhanced with graphene doping which leads to a better distribution of the active phases on the composite support surface. 3.3 Proposed reaction mechanism for hydrodesulfurization There are two routes for sulfur removal from DBT, namely, hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrogenolysis or direct desulfurization (DDS), as in Fig. 6 . In the case of hydrogenation, tetrahydro and hexahydro DBT were obtained as intermediate products for DBT. Then, desulfurization occurred to form cyclohexyl benzene and finally bicyclohexyl, while, in the DDS route, no intermediate products are formed as DBT was desulfurized directly to form biphenyl. The reaction pathway of DBT hydrodesulfurization over the synthesized catalysts is proposed in Fig. 7 . Product analysis in GCMS was used to illustrate the proposed pathway. It was expected to be hydrogenolysis as DBT was desulfurized by C–S bond breaking to obtain biphenyl (BP). The presence of a hydrogen source leads to the hydrogenation of biphenyl to get cyclohexyl benzene (CHB). The large number of peaks in GCMS may be attributed to the high number of products that were separated for each analysis, Fig. S5. The characteristic peak at 154 m/z is related to biphenyl, while the peak at 166 m/z was attributed to bicyclohexyl. As a conclusion from these results, the direct desulfurization pathway can be a dominant path for DBT over the ZGMoCo catalyst. The percent distribution of the compoundbiphenyl, cyclohexyl benzene, tetrahydro dibenzothiophene and hexahydro dibenzothiophene were listed in Table S3, it was shown that the contribution of the intermediate products THDBT and HDDBT is very low while the ratio of CHB and BP is high to confirm the conclusion regarding the dominance of DDS pathway as the main one for hydrodesulfurization of DBT [45–47]. In Fig. 7, structural interactions are proposed between graphene and zeolite, in addition to the combination of the active phases and the composite support surface. As a final step, C–S bond breaking and releasing of biphenyl from DBT. The existence of hydrogen during HDS lead to the formation of bicyclohexyl. A comparison of our catalyst with literature was made and presented in Table 3 . 4 Conclusion The results in this work showed the higher activity of zeolite Y type -graphene/ molybdenum - cobalt (nickel) compared to zeolite Y type / molybdenum-cobalt (nickel) for dibenzo thiophene hydrodesulfurization reactions. Data obtained for the synthesized catalyst showed an improvement in the textural properties like surface area and pore size after doping graphene as a co-support with zeolite Y type. The SEM images illustrated the enhanced dispersion of the active phases on the support surface in the presence of graphene. TGA indicated the improved thermal stability of the synthesized catalyst, as the percentage weight loss for the four catalysts has been reduced after graphene incorporation within the support. The EDX results confirmed the successful introduction of the nanoparticles' active phase on the support surface. The novel catalysts ZGMoCo and ZGMoNi evaluation for the desulfurization of DBT was found to be superior when compared to the reference samples ZMoCo and ZMoNi. The catalyst activity was ≈98 % (ZGMoCo) removal of sulfur compared to 91.4 % (ZMoCo) and 97.5 % (ZGMoNi) to 89.8 % (ZMoNi). Regarding the mechanism pathway involved during the HDS reaction, it was found to be direct desulfurization as per the obtained data from GC–MS. In conclusion, we confirmed the effective role of graphene doping within the catalyst to form composite support. The superior activity for sulfur removal with enhanced properties was also obtained.

        "dc:description": "A composite of zeolite Y type -graphene as a support doped with molybdenum-cobalt and molybdenum-nickel (active phase and promoter) was synthesized and evaluated as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. The ZGMoCo was found to have the ability to reduce the sulfur content by ≈98 % after a 5 h reaction time which is higher compared to the ZMoCo or ZMoNi. This activity can be ascribed to the improved surface area and better distribution of the active phases (molybdenum and cobalt or nickel) on the zeolite Y type -graphene surface. SEM images showed enhanced dispersion of the active phases on the support surface. As per the BET measurements, the surface area was improved due to the introduction of graphene to be 323.6 m2/g ZGMoCo compared to 257.3 m2/g ZMoCo; and 312.5 m2/g for ZGMoNi compared to 245.7 m2/g for ZMoNi. The work offers a convenient approach to prepare an effective HDS catalyst.",
