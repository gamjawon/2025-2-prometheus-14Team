Graphical abstract Polymer-immobilized fluorinase for the synthesis of 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyadenosine (FDA) from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and fluoride ion in aqueous media is described. The optimal composition of the poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and the heterogeneous catalytic reaction conditions are developed to yield FDA in 45% within 150min. In PET radiochemistry, using [18F]fluoride ion in [18O]H2O obtained from the cyclotron, [18F]FDA was synthesized in 68% fluorination efficiency. The immobilized fluorinase is recycled for up to four runs with catalytic activity of the immobilized fluorinase enzyme remains at 80%.

Keywords Nucleophilic fluorination Enzymatic catalysis Polymer support Immobilized fluorinase 1 Introduction 1.1 Statement of significance Research on a simple, mild and selective fluorination methodology of complex molecules is critical in facilitating the development of pharmaceuticals and in accelerating the field of molecular diagnostics. Fluorinated organic molecules are known to enhance lipophilicity, metabolic stability, bioavailability and selectivity through their inductive effects [1a–c]. Additionally, the less stable fluorine-18 isotope counterpart is an ideal nuclide for molecular diagnostic using positron emission tomography (PET) due to the moderate half-life and the high image resolution in PET imaging in comparison to other radioisotopes [2]. To date, fluorine-18 labeling reactions require time consuming multistep synthesis in organic solvents due to the incompatibility of fluoride ions with other functional groups, the use of harsh reagents and the need of high reaction temperatures to produce injectable doses of PET probes in less than 6h [3,4]. More recently various fluorination methodologies utilizing transition-metal catalysts and bulky protic solvents are emerging to simplify fluorination reactions [5]. Notably, the enzyme catalyzed fluorination reaction using fluoride ion in aqueous media is particularly attractive due to its high chemoselectivity and high reaction yield under extremely mild conditions [6–8]. In the field of enzyme catalysis for organic syntheses, solid supported enzymes enable simpler separation of the enzymes from the product, and the immobilized enzymes could be recycled over a finite number of cycles. These features of immobilized enzymes have the potential to reduce the overall cost and synthesis time [9,10]. However, there is no evidence of successful applications of recyclable biocatalysts for fluorination of organic molecules. Specifically in PET radiochemistry, the short-lived [18F]fluorine isotope (t 1/2 =109min) necessitates the development of a rapid, simple and efficient methodology for the preparation of [18F]-labeled compounds to obtain optimal PET images. Therefore, it is critical to streamline the radiolabeling process with the shortest time for reaction, purification and reformulation. Specifically for homogeneous enzymatic reactions, the enzymes need to be first separated from the reaction product prior to subjecting the crude mixture through a standard purification process. Thus, the combined features of solid phase enzymatic fluorination catalysis and the mild and selective enzymatic reactions have significant potential toward the development of a more efficient, simplified and rapid preparation of fluorine containing molecules. 1.2 Known procedures O’Hagan and co-workers discovered and isolated a specific halogenase, called fluorinase (also known as 5′-deoxy-5′-fluoroadenosine synthase, EC 2.5.1.63) to catalyze the reaction of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) with fluoride ion [11,12]. In comparison to conventional synthetic methodologies, which require multistep reactions, high temperature, long synthesis time and necessitate complicated purification processes, enzymatic reactions are performed in a single step under mild reaction temperature and produce only a single compound in high yield. It was demonstrated that the fluorination of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) substrate in the presence of fluorinase and l-amino acid oxidase produces 5′-deoxy-5′-fluoroadenosine with over 90% yield. The enzymatic fluorination reaction proceeds at 38°C and the reaction time was as short as 1h [13,14]. While the fluorination methodology is attractive, the disadvantages of working with enzymes are the need to separate the enzymes from the reaction product prior to the standard purification process and the high cost of the enzyme. To the best to our knowledge, there is only one report on the investigation of immobilized fluorinase preparation and its recyclability. Kitazume and co-workers investigated the recyclability of fluorinase immobilized on the BL-100 polymer (butyl rubber latex) [15], using ionic liquid as the reaction solvent. However, the yield of the desired FDA product is low in the first cycle (19.8%) and dramatically decreased to 2.6% and 0.4% in the second and third cycles, respectively. Herein, we developed a new immobilization methodology of fluorinase on a functional polymer monolith to catalyze the formation of C-F bond in aqueous media in a higher yield than the previous report using KF. We also investigated various enzymatic processes, recyclability and demonstrated the applicability of this methodology for the preparation of fluorine-18 labeled FDA. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Enzyme and chemicals 2.1.1 Fluorinase isolation Fluorinase enzyme was isolated by Dr. Mark Arbing and Sum Chan, at the Protein Expression Technology Center, UCLA-DOE Institute for Genomics and Proteomics, University of California, Los Angeles. Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) pLysS were used for fluorinase production. The fluorinase gene (flA) was amplified from the S. cattleya NBRC14057 genome using primers reported previously [16–18]. Only a single, silent mutation in flA was detected by DNA analysis. The flA was cloned in pET28b+ (GenScript, USA) and consequently fused to the His-tag-containing peptide in the N-terminal of the enzyme, termed pETflA. The His-tagged flA protein was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-NTA (Sigma) affinity column followed by gel filtration chromatography using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution column (GE Healthcare). 2.1.2 Reagents and buffers All commercially available reagents and buffers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. 2.2 Analytical methods 2.2.1 RP-HPLC analysis The fluorination reaction was monitored by RP-HPLC analysis carried out using the Knauer Analytical System (Column: Phenomenex® Luna C18 5μm, 250mm×4.60mm; UV–vis detection at λ =254nm). Isocratic elution with water:ethanol (80:20, v/v) mixture was applied and a flow-rate of 0.6ml/min was used. 2.2.2 Enzyme quantity determination Fluorinase concentration in solutions was assayed according to the Bradford method [19] with bovine serum albumin as a standard and Coomassie® Brilliant Blue G dye (Fluka Analytical). UV/vis experiments were performed using Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer at λ =600nm. 2.2.3 IR analysis ATR-IR spectra of polymers as solid powders were analyzed using Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5. 2.2.4 UV-polymerization conditions Polymerization reactions were performed using the Electro-cure 500 UV flood curing chamber equipped UV lamp at 365nm and an output power of 30mW/cm2. 2.2.5 Radio-TLC conditions Radio-TLC measurements were performed using a Raytest mini-Gita TLC-station equipped with Beta detector GMC. Silica TLC plates were developed in a water:ethanol (80:20, v/v) mixture. 2.3 Enzyme-catalyzed fluorination with immobilized fluorinase 2.3.1 Preparation of polymers The polymer monoliths were prepared as described by Yu et al. [20]. Preparation of GMA:EDMA (2:1) polymer monolith: AIBN 12mg, 0.073mmol was placed into a 20ml scintillation vial containing glycidyl methacrylate monomer (665μl, 5mmol) and the ethylene dimethacrylate crosslinker (455μl, 2.42mmol). 1820μl of methanol and 455μl of ethanol were added as porogens. The reaction mixture was degassed by sonication for 10min. The mixture was then divided into 1ml-aliquots, which were placed into three separate 20ml scintillation vials and were polymerized under the UV light (λ =365nm) for 94min. The polymer was finally washed with methanol through Soxhlet extraction for 12h and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C overnight to obtain a white crystalline powder. ATR: 755, 847, 905, 990, 1145, 1254, 1456, 1635, 1653, 1684, 1718cm−1. 2.3.2 Preparation of the immobilized fluorinase Fluorinase solution in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 100μl, C =2.79mg/ml) was placed into a scintillation vial containing 20mg of polymer and 400μl of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The vial was capped and shaken intensively with an orbital shaker at 600rpm for 1h at room temperature. The top supernatant was discarded and analyzed for residual protein concentration via the Bradford method and the effective concentration of the immobilized fluorinase was calculated as a difference between the starting concentration (C st) and residual enzyme concentration (C res) in solution (C eff = C st − C res). The polymer was washed with phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 2×200μl) to remove residual protein solution. Then the fluorinase immobilized on the polymer monolith was stabilized by washing with 4×300μl of phosphate buffer, shaking the vial for 1h at RT during each wash cycle. Finally, the immobilized fluorinase (0.7mg flA/20mg polymer) was dried in vacuum over CaSO4. 2.3.3 Determination of enzyme leakage A portion of the polymer-immobilized fluorinase (20mg of polymer and 0.7mg of enzyme) was placed in a scintillation vial containing 600μl of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The heterogeneous mixture was shaken with the orbital shaker at 600rpm for 1h at room temperature. The top supernatant was removed and analyzed for the total enzyme concentration that was leached out using the Bradford method. The percentage of leached enzyme was calculated using this formula: %leakage={C leak/C immob}×100. The concentration of the remaining enzyme was calculated as C eff = C immob − C leak . The procedure was repeated for several times to obtain the graph of enzyme leakage from the carrier surface (Fig. 1 ). 2.3.4 Single-run enzymatic fluorination procedure A portion of polymer-immobilized fluorinase (20mg of polymer and 0.7mg of enzyme) was placed in the scintillation vial. Solutions of l-AAO (300μl, C =30mg/ml), SAM (100μl, C =10mg/ml) and potassium fluoride (100μl, C =50mg/ml) in phosphate buffer were added and the mixture was diluted with 500μl of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The vial was capped and incubated at 38°C for 150min with intensive shaking at 500rpm. After the reaction was finished, the supernatant was removed and subjected to heating at 95°C for 5min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 6,500rpm for 15min and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC for FDA content. Target product identity was confirmed by comparison with the standard FDA sample. 2.3.5 Recycling of enzyme For experiments on recyclability, the reaction was done in the same way as for the single-run reaction. After separation of the aqueous solution, the fluorinase-containing polymer was washed with phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 3μl×200μl) and dried in the vacuum desiccator over CaSO4. Then, the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was repeated. The whole procedure was repeated until a significant loss of fluorinase activity was observed. 2.3.6 Single-run enzymatic radiofluorination procedure A portion of polymer-immobilized fluorinase (20mg of polymer and 0.7mg of enzyme) was placed in a 1.8ml scintillation vial. Solutions of l-AAO (10μl, C =10mg/ml), SAM (10μl, C =8mg/ml) and 18F-fluoride (7μl, 5mCi) were added and the mixture was diluted with 50μl of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The vial was capped and incubated at 38°C for 150min with intensive shaking at 500rpm. After the reaction was finished, the supernatant was removed and heated at 95°C for 5min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 6500rpm for 15min and the supernatant was analyzed by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC for conversion of [18F]FDA from the [18F]fluoride ion. The [18F]FDA product identity was confirmed by comparing the retention time with the standard FDA sample on the radio-HPLC. 3 Results and discussion Immobilized enzymes are widely used in organic syntheses to fully apply the technical and economic advantages of biocatalysts based on isolated enzymes. Immobilization enables enzymes to be easily separated from the reaction mixture, and can significantly lower the costs of synthesis by recycling the enzyme for a finite number of reaction cycles. Immobilized enzyme preparations also provide a well-balanced overall performance, based on reasonable immobilization yields, low mass transfer limitations, and high operational stability [21]. Generally, enzyme immobilization involves binding the enzyme via a simple adsorption or covalent binding to a carrier (support) with different composition and geometry (e.g. ion exchange resin, mesoporous silica, polypropylene hollow fiber, glass balls, cellulose membrane and magnetic beads) [22–24]. For our studies, we decided to use the glycidyl methacrylate functionalized polymeric carriers for three reasons: (a) the epoxide functionalized polymer monolith enables covalent binding of the enzyme to the solid carrier to increase the stability of the immobilized enzyme and the ability to recycle the enzyme, (b) the GMA-EDMA polymer monolith is compatible with the nucleophilic fluorination reaction, and (c) polymethacrylate supports are known for their high mechanical and chemical stability. Specifically for fluorine chemistry, inorganic carriers such as silica and ion exchange resin are not suitable due to their strong interaction with the fluoride ion reagent during the fluorination reaction [25]. There are also numerous papers utilizing the commercially available Eupergit® polymer beads with successful immobilization of different classes of enzymes [26,27]. Herein, we chose to prepare Eupergit®-like polymer monolith using glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) monomer as the reactive functional moiety and ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) cross-linker. The reactive glycidyl groups on the poly(GMA-EDMA) monolith allow the formation of covalent linkages to the fluorinase, thus enabling easy separation of the enzyme from the product and the ability to recycle the enzyme. Furthermore, polymer support based on monolithic structures were chosen due to their unique properties, including high surface area and porosity to allow easy access of both the enzyme and substrate, high mechanical stability and the versatility of installing functional groups on the pore surface of the polymer monolith. Based on our previous experiments (unpublished), water is necessary in the enzymatic fluorination of SAM. The high porosity of the macroporous nature of monolithic support is anticipated to adsorb sufficient amount of water within the monolith to assist the heterogeneous enzymatic fluorination reaction. In our studies, we utilized the standard SAM-to-FDA reaction catalyzed by the fluorinase enzyme. (Scheme 1 ) [14]. The initial investigations were carried out in phosphate buffer at 38°C for 12h. In this paper, the optimal ratio of GMA and EDMA in the monolith was investigated by varying the feed ratios of the GMA monomers to the EDMA crosslinker in the polymerization mixture (Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1, the increase of GMA content in the polymer monolith resulted in a significant decrease of the FDA yield, presumably due to the excess of glycidyl groups, which are not covalently bound to the fluorinase. Decreasing the composition of GMA feed ratio to 1:1 led to a decreased in the FDA yield. This observation could be explained by the insufficient concentration of oxiranyl moieties to bind with the necessary amount of enzyme, which led to the reduction of the reaction rate. Based on this polymer composition study, the following optimization experiments were carried out using the GMA:EDMA polymer monolith with 2:1 feed ratio. To eliminate any contribution from the homogeneous catalysis reaction, we determined the number of solvent washes needed to achieve a high stability of the immobilized enzyme on the polymer monoliths. We confirmed that the catalytic activity observed originated from the covalently immobilized enzyme by preparing the standard fluorinase-polymer composition and analyzed the supernatant of the subsequent washes via the Bradford method to determine the leakage of enzyme from the polymer monolith. Based on this study, the initial immobilization rate was calculated to be 90%, which translates to a net content of 0.75mg fluorinase/20mg polymer. Subsequently, the stability of the immobilized enzyme was investigated by measuring the amount of enzyme that leaked out to the solution phase. As shown in Fig. 1, 6.5% of the immobilized enzyme leaked out during the first four wash cycles, which is confirmed by the Bradford analysis. In the subsequent washes (5th and 6th cycles), no fluorinase was detected in the supernatant phase, which indicated that the remaining enzymes were covalently immobilized on the polymer monolith, and was thus stable for the solid supported enzymatic fluorination reactions. The total enzyme leakage was analyzed to be ~7% (0.05mg), and the final effective amount of the deposited enzymes was calculated to be 0.7mg in 20mg of polymer carrier. Based on this observation, the subsequent fluorinase-polymer preparations were first stabilized with four wash cycles after the immobilization step and prior to the fluorination reaction. Next, the most effective concentration of fluorinase used for the immobilization was investigated to achieve the highest yield of FDA. In this study, a range of 0.06–1mg of fluorinase immobilized onto 20mg of polymer was investigated (Fig. 2 ). We found that the optimal enzyme loading for the GMA:EDMA 2:1 polymer monolith is 0.75mg of fluorinase per 20mg of solid carrier (0.7mg in stabilized form). Based on this fluorinase concentration, 41% of FDA was obtained from the heterogeneous enzymatic fluorination reaction. In comparison to the work by Kitazume et al. [15] our method allows 2.5-fold increase of fluorinase to be immobilized onto the GMA-EDMA monolith with concurrent increase in the FDA yield by two-fold. There have been numerous reports on the discrepancies of the optimal pH values of immobilized enzyme versus the same enzyme when applied in a homogeneous solution reaction. Based on our previous experience, we learned that the immobilized enzymes may exhibit higher catalytic activity at a different pH optimum from the one reported for the same enzyme in solution [24]. This observation led us to investigate the optimal pH value of the immobilized fluorinase to achieve the highest catalytic activity. In this study, the heterogeneous enzymatic reactions were performed in varying pH values ranging from pH 6.5 to 9. Phosphate buffers of desired pH were used for this purpose and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . Based on these experiments, we demonstrated that the pH-optimum of fluorinase remains at pH 8.0, which was reported for the homogeneous reactions in aqueous solutions [14]. The yield of FDA was optimal between pH 7.5 and 8.5, but the enzyme activity was dramatically reduced at pH outside the range of 6.5–9 as shown in Fig. 3. Finally, the reaction kinetics of SAM and fluoride ion to yield FDA catalyzed by the polymer-immobilized fluorinase was investigated. Based on the optimal polymer supported catalysis condition established in this report, the reaction kinetic was carried out by analyzing aliquots of the reaction mixture at pre-determined time periods (Fig. 4 ). As shown in the kinetic curve (Fig. 4), the optimal fluorination time catalyzed by the polymer-immobilized fluorinase is 150min and the maximum yield achieved was 45±2% (n =5). The 150min reaction time is 2.5 times longer in comparison to the same reaction performed homogeneously [14]. This observation is anticipated for immobilized enzyme due to various mass transfer limitations, such as the diffusion of the substrate and product in and out from the catalytic pocket through the macroporous carrier [28]. Since the half-life of [18F]fluorine is 109min, the 150min of reaction time using the polymer-immobilized fluorinase remains attractive for the synthesis of 18F-labeled PET-tracers. Based on the optimized conditions, the recyclability of the polymer-immobilized enzyme catalyst was investigated in the fluorination of SAM. The immobilized fluorinase was reused several times by replacing a new batch of reagent after each fluorination reaction (150min) and the yield of FDA was analyzed via the HPLC (Fig. 5 ). As shown in Fig. 5, the enzyme activity gradually decreases during the first 4 runs. Between runs 1–4, the enzyme activity decreased from 100% to 82%. The enzyme lost most of its activity after the 4th run. Based on this recyclability experiment, we showed the turnover number (TON) of the polymer-immobilized fluorinase is equal to 4, and the total FDA amount which can be produced with one enzyme loading is about 184%. To prove the applicability of the newly developed method for the synthesis of PET-tracers, radiofluorination reactions were carried out, using the [18F]F−/[18O]H2O obtained from cyclotron. For the enzymatic radiofluorination reaction, we found that it is absolutely critical to reduce the overall reaction volume from 500μl (performed in cold chemistry) to 100μl, presumably due to the low concentration of the [18F]fluoride ion. Based on the optimized polymer supported enzymatic reaction, the radiofluorination efficiency of [18F]fluoride ion to [18F]FDA was analyzed to be 68% on the radio-TLC. The differences in the yield reported for the cold and hot chemistry can be explained by the differences in the definition of yield. In radiochemistry, the [18F]fluoride ion is the limiting reagent and thus the reaction yield is conventionally defined based on the conversion of the [18F]fluoride ion to [18F]FDA. In cold chemistry, the limiting reagent is the SAM substrate, and therefore, the reaction yield is calculated based on the conversion of SAM to FDA. 4 Conclusions We successfully demonstrated for the first time a practical application of the polymer monolith supported fluorinase for solid phase (radio)fluorination. An optimal composition of poly(GMA-EDMA) monoliths, enzyme loading, pH, reaction time, and an optimal immobilization protocol were developed to yield FDA in a much higher yield (49%) and TON (4) than the previously reported literature [15]. The recyclability of the optimized polymer-supported enzymatic catalyst was demonstrated with a TON of four and a total yield of 184% of FDA using 1 enzyme loading. This is the first example of a polymer-immobilized fluorinase application for the synthesis of 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyadenosine with high fluorination efficiency and turnover number. This polymer supported enzymatic catalysis methodology has the potential to simplify the separation of the enzyme from the reaction product, stabilize the enzyme against harsh reaction conditions, and allow repetitive use of the enzyme. Furthermore, we have also showed that this solid phase methodology can be used to produce [18F]F-labeled compound for PET imaging with the ultimate aim to simplify and shorten the overall enzymatic (radio)fluorination reaction While this first proof of concept study showed that the polymer supported fluorinase remained relatively active, we will investigate the co-immobilization of both the fluorinase and the amino oxidase coenzyme to eliminate the need of separating the enzyme from the crude reaction mixture.
