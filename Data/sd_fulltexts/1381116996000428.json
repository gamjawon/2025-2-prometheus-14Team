Bodnar, T. Mallat, A. Baiker * Department of Chemical Engineering and Industriul Chemistry, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH-Zentrum. CH-8092 Ziirich, S~vitzerlund Received 8 November 1995; accepted 19 January 1996 Abstract The selective, one step oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TMQ) by a catalytic amount of CuClz (up to 100 turnovers) and NH,OH . HCl has been investigated. TMQ was obtained in up to 80% yield using only 1.5 wt% CuC12 catalyst (related to the amount of TMP) and 2.8 wt% NH,OH . HCl co-catalyst under ambient conditions. The initial oxidation state of copper had no influence on the rate or selectivity of the reaction. The synergy between catalyst and co-catalyst was most prominent in the low concentration range. Highest TMQ yield was obtained with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), whereas the use of molecular oxygen (under pressure) resulted in relatively poor yield. At low TBHP/TMP ratio, the dimer content of the product is significant, but can be efficiently suppressed by applying the oxidant in lo-25 mol% excess to the stoichiometric ratio. The TMQ yield could be improved by adding TMP in portions during oxidation, and by using TBHP in air instead of nitrogen atmosphere. The presence of Cl- ion proved to be important for obtaining good selectivity, but the formation of 4-chloro-2,3,6-trimethylphenol as an intermediate can be excluded, when the amount of catalyst is less than 3 wt%. Electrochemical and catalytic investigations revealed that the reduction of Cu by TMP and its reoxidation by TBHP are fast, but the further oxidation of the dimer intermediate to TMQ is slow.

An im- portant synthesis route to vitamin E starts with the oxidation of 2,3,6_trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,6-trimethyl- 1,4-benzoquinone (TMQ), ac- cording to Scheme 1.

In acetone/water mix- ture the yield is 80-87% at full conversion. Several moditications of this reaction have been developed using copper halides together with alkali, alkali earth and ammonium halides [2-91. A serious drawback of the method is that an almost stoichiometric amount of CuCl, is re- quired for complete and selective oxidation of TMP. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

A milestone in the development of the oxida- tion of TMP to TMQ, was the work of Japanese researchers who were the first to reduce the amount of CuCl, by applying nitrogen contain- ing compounds as co-catalysts [ 10-141. The best co-catalyst is hydroxylamine hydrochlo- ride, but some oximes and amines (as hydro- chlorides) are also effective. However, during scale-up of the process the amount of CuCl, has to be increased to obtain good yield. For example, the oxidation of 270 mg TMP with 80% yield requires 125 wt% CuCl, . 2H,O related to the reactant, but the oxidation of 680 mg TMP necessitates 25 wt% CuCl, * 2H,O for obtaining the same yield [14]. The selectivity to TMQ obtained with equimolar amount of CuCl, atalystcan also be improved by the addition of NH,VO,, MnCl, or CoCl, [15-171, but the amount of CuCl, cannot be reduced by this way. Some heteropolyacids, such as H 3+?lPMo i2 _ ,V,O,, , also catalyse the oxidation of TMP with molecular oxygen [l&20]. TMQ yields up to 86% have been obtained in polar solvents, but the amount of catalyst is rather high, over 25 wt% related to TMP. Hydrogen peroxide is also frequently used as oxidising agent in the synthesis of TMQ. Vari- ous metal salt catalysts have been tested and the best result, 90% yield at full conversion, was achieved using only 1.5 wt% RuCl, in AcOH [21,22]. However, RuCl, is rather expensive and other catalysts, such as Cu, Fe or MO salts, were hardly selective. For example, using CuCl, or CuCl the yields were only 32% and 37%, respectively. Several heteropolyacids, containing Si, MO, W or P, catalyse the oxidation of TMP with H,O, in acetic acid [23-251. Interestingly, the selectivity of heteropolyacids is lower with H,O, than with molecular oxygen and TMQ yields of only 57-72% have been obtained even at relatively high catalyst/reactant ratio (> 33 wt%). Here we show that the amount of CuCl, catalyst can be substantially reduced compared to literature data, if the oxidation of TMP is carried out with alkylhydroperoxides as oxidant in acetic acid. The TMQ yield can be increased by applying co-catalysts such as NH,OH . HCl. The influence of some important reaction pa- rameters has been studied and a kinetic analysis of the rather complex reaction, supported with UV-Vis and electrochemical potential measure- ments is presented. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Analytical grade reagents were used, except TMP and TMQ, which were of technical grade (supplied by Hoffman-La Roche AG). TMP was recrystallised from hexane before use. For the experiments the following solutions were used: tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, 70 wt% in water), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP, 80 wt% in cumene), peracetic acid (32 wt% in AcOH) and H,O, (35 wt% in water). 2.2. General oxidation procedure The oxidation of TMP was performed in a 200 ml flat-bottomed, thermostated glass batch reactor, equipped with gas inlet and outlet, re- flux condenser, magnetic stirrer and thermome- ter. In a typical oxidation procedure TMP (2.5 g, 18.4 mmol), CuCl, catalyst (25 mg, 0.19 mmol), NH,OH . HCl co-catalyst (140 mg, 2.0 mmol) and AcOH (30 ml) were put into the reactor and flushed with nitrogen (99.999%). TBHP (6 ml, 44 mmol) was added to the stirred mixture after 5 min. Other reaction parameters are indicated in the tables and in the figure captions. The relative amount of catalyst (in wt%) is defined as catalyst:TMP weight ratio. Yield and conversion were determined using gas chromatography. An HP 5890 chromato- graph equipped with cool on-column injection and an HP-l fused silica capillary column with a retention gap were used. Several by-products, including 4-chloro-2,3,6_trimethylphenol (CITMP), 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-hydroquinone (TMHQ) and the dimers: 2,23,36,6hexa- methyl-4,4biphenyldiol (D) and 2,23,36,6 hexamethyl-4,4biphenylquinone (DQ) could be detected. Unfortunately, D and DQ could not be separated properly and the presence of polymers was undetectable. GC-MS was used for identi- fication of the peaks and pentadecane was ap- plied as an inner standard for quantitative analy- sis. 2.3. Physico-chemical measurements The measurement of electrochemical poten- tial was performed in a magnetically stirred 200 ml electrochemical cell (Metrohm No.: 6.1415.250). The reference electrode was AglAgClIKCl (0.1 M) (Metrohm No.: 6.0724.140) with a double bridge filled with 0.1 M KC1 to protect the reference electrode from the reaction medium. The working electrode was a bright Au rod (Metrohm No.: 6.033 1.060). The solvent was 30 ml AcOH deoxygenated with nitrogen before the measurement. The po- tentials in the figures and text are referred to the applied reference electrode. UV-Vis spectra were measured at wave- lengths between 200 and 900 nm of samples in quartz cells ( 10 mm path lengths) employing a Perkin Elmer Lambda 16 spectrophotometer. For the measurements the samples and reference materials were diluted with AcOH. 3. Results 3.1. Synergy between catalyst ad co-catalyst A strong interaction was found between the influence of the amount of catalyst and co-cata- lyst. Selectivities obtained in the oxidation of TMP with CuCl, catalyst and NH,OH . HCl co-catalyst are presented in Fig. 1. With increas- ing amount of CuCl? the reaction is faster, and in the presence of at least 1 wt% CuCl, the conversion is always complete in 2 h. Without catalyst and co-catalyst only 10% conversion and no selectivity to TMQ was achieved. The higher the amount of CuCl, (without co-cata- lyst), the more selective is the oxidation to TMQ.

Bodnar et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 1 IO (1996) 55-63 there is an optimum in the amount of CuCl,. As an example to these local maxima, 100% con- version and 72% selectivity was achieved with 3 wt% catalyst and 6 wt% co-catalyst. Interest- ingly, the lower the amount of CuCl,, the higher is the synergic effect between catalyst and co- catalyst. 3.2. Chemical nature of catalyst and co-catalyst Substitution of CuCl, by CuCl as catalyst, under otherwise identical conditions, had no detectable influence on conversion and selectiv- ity. The role of the initial oxidation state of copper will be discussed later. Concerning the nature of the anion, Cl- ions provided far better results than acetate, sulphate or nitrate ions. Substitution of CuCl, by FeCl, was detrimental to the selectivity. Note, that FeCl, is a good catalyst in the hydroxylation of phenols with Co-catalysts Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 shows the influence of some co-cata- lysts on the conversion of TMP and selectivity to TMQ and dimers (D + DQ) in the presence of 1 wt% CuCl,. The selection of these com- pounds was based on the analogy to well-known oxidising systems such as Fenton, Hamilton and Udenfriend reagents [26-281. All com- pounds (and several others not shown in Fig. 2) provided lower selectivity to TMQ and some- times also a lower rate of conversion than NH,OH: HCl. Similarly, hydroxylamine hydro- chloride was more efficient in improving the rate and selectivity of the CuCl,-catalysed oxi- dation than other salts of hydroxylamine, in agreement with earlier observations [14]. When applying HCl (in equivalent amount) instead of NH,OH * HCl, conversion and selectivity dropped to 88% and 42%, respectively. This is an indication that HCl alone is not a good co-catalyst, but the Cl- ion is important in the Z. Bodnar et al. / Journal ofMolecular Catalysis A: Chemical 110 (1996) 55-63 59 interaction between CuCl, and NH,OH * HCl (reduction of Cu*+ and complexation, see later). The influence of NH,OH + HCl on TMP con- version and the formation of TMQ and dimers during reaction is presented in Fig. 3. Note that in this case the inner standard could not be used and the % values represent only the integrated area of the peaks of the gas chromatogram. The conversion of TMP was scarcely influenced by the addition of NH,OH . HCl, but the yield of TMQ increased and the actual concentration of dimers was suppressed by the co-catalyst. It seems that the role of NH,OH . HCl as a co- catalyst is most probably to promote the further oxidation of dimers to TMQ, as has been pro- posed earlier [ 181. 3.3. Oxidising agent The oxidation of TMP to TMQ or D are shown by the formal Eqs. (1) and (2), respec- tively: C,H,,O + 2TBHP -+ C,H,,O, + H,O + 2t-BuOH (1) 2C,H ,20 + TBHP -+ C ,XHz202 + H,O + t-BuOH (2) In agreement with this stoichiometry, 2-2.5 mole TBHP/mole TMP were necessary to achieve full conversion and good yield, as illus- trated in Fig. 4. At low TBHP/TMP ratio the dimer content in the product was significant, but could be efficiently suppressed by applying at least 2 mole oxidant per mole reactant. (Note that there was always some unused TBHP pre- sent at the end of the reaction, but its amount was not determined quantitatively.) Table 1 shows that concerning the TMQ yield (conversion X selectivity), molecular oxy- gen (under pressure) was the poorest and TBHP was the best oxidising agent. Note that TBHP is a stable organic peroxide and safer to handle than peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxide. Usu- ally, the reactions were carried out under nitro- gen at 1 bar. Interestingly, when the nitrogen atmosphere was substituted by air, the TMQ 100 - Conversion Yield I , I_ 0 1 2 3 4 TBHPiTMP (mol/mol) Fig. 3.

Intermediates and by-products The time dependence of TMP conversion to TMQ using 1 or 3 wt% CuCl? is depicted in Figs. 3 and 5, respectively. Interestingly, the amount of TMQ increased even when TMP was fully converted. For example, in the presence of 3 wt% CuCl, (Fig. 5) TMP was consumed in 60 min but the amount of TMQ increased slowly Table I Efficiency of various oxidising agents Oxidising agent Conversion % Selectivity % O2 (50 bar) 57 48 H,O, * 100 48 Peracetic acid 100 48 CHP 90 63 TBHP 100 68 TBHP/air 100 72 Conditions: 2.5 g TMP, 30 ml AcOH, 25 mg CuCI,, 140 mg NH,OH.

(Decomposition of TMQ was found to be negli- gible under the mild reaction conditions.) The shift on the time scale between the consumption of TMP and formation of TMQ can easily be explained by assuming that TMQ is formed - at least partly - via an intermediate. It has been proposed previously [ 181 that TMP is trans- formed to TMQ via dimer formation, as shown in Scheme 2. Our results support this assump- tion. The total amount of intermediates and by-products, defined as X in Fig. 5 and deter- mined by gas chromatographic analysis, repre- sents the material formed in the reaction exclud- ing TMQ. The time-resolved amount of X reached almost 50% at the beginning of the reaction and decreased slowly, parallel to the formation of TMQ. Besides the dimers, there are two other com- pounds proposed as intermediates [ 14,181: (i> When oxygen and a large amount of CuCl, as catalyst are used, a considerable amount of 4-chloro-2,3,6_trimethylphenol (ClTMP) is produced [14], which is mostly con- sumed by the end of the reaction (Scheme 2). In our case the maximum amount of ClTMP was less than 1% in the presence of 3 wt% CuCl,, as shown in Fig. 5, and it was below the detection limit (ca. 0.01%) throughout the reac- tion when only 1 wt% CuCl, was used. (ii) Direct hydroxylation of TMP results in 2,3,6-trimethyl- ,4-hydroquinone (TMHQ, Scheme 2). This intermediate was hardly de- tectable ( < 0.1 %o> even at the beginning of the reaction, independent of the reaction conditions. This observation suggests that in the (CuCl,- NH,OH . HCl-TBHP-AcOH) oxidising sys- tem, TMQ formation via direct hydroxylation of TMP to TMHQ is less important than the reac- tion via dimers. ----- _---__ __________________ ______ ___________________.__...______ __{ Cl CITMP Scheme 2. 61 3.5. Addition of TMP in portions An interesting and hitherto not reported ob- servation is that the yield of TMQ can be increased by adding TMP in portions to the reaction mixture. The best result was obtained when two portions of TMP were added, with the second portion being added lo-20 min after starting the oxidation reaction. Applying shorter or longer time intervals or continuous dosing of TMP diminished the effect. About 10% increase in TMQ yield was obtained by this method. compared to the reaction performed under iden- tical conditions but adding the total amount of TMP at the beginning of the reaction. For ex- ample, 807~ TMQ could be prepared by adding TMP in two portions and using only 1.5 wt% overall catalyst/reactant ratio (reaction condi- tions: 5 g TMP, 75 mg CuCl,, 140 mg NH ,OH . HCl. 30 ml AcOH. 12 ml TBHP, 25, 2 h. nitrogen atmosphere). Note, that this reaction was repeated on a tenfold greater scale without losing TMQ yield. 3.6. PhJsico-chemicul measurement In order to gain some information on the nature of interaction between catalyst. co-cata- lyst and reactant, UV-Vis and electrochemical potential measurement were undertaken. A shift in the UV--Vis spectrum at around 400-500 nm was observed when CuC12 and NH,OH * HCl were mixed in AcOH, and there was no de- tectable change when mixing CuClz and TMP or TMQ. However. the concentrations were sev- eral orders of magnitude lower (due to the requirements of the method) than the usual con- centrations during TMP oxidation. Fig. 6 and Table 1 show the electrochemical potentials measured during mixing of the reac- tion components in a nitrogen atmosphere and during oxidation with TBHP. The potential of CuCII in AcOH in the reactor is about the same as the redox potential of a CuClJCuCl = 40 mol/mol system (mixture A in Table 2). Note that this potential was rather stable and not 600 TMP 560 1 s Jk 540 - 3 E E 520 - a 500 . t 480 t 460 1 440a 0 10 20 30 40 Time (min) F-if. 6.

When TMP was added to the CuC12 catalyst, the electrochemical potential rapidly decreased to a value which corre- sponded to the reduced state of the catalyst (mixture B). This observation explains why both CuC12 and CuCl are equally good catalysts for TMP oxidation.

Bodnar et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical II0 (1996) 55-63 When NH,OH - HCl was added first to CuCl, in AcOH, the electrochemical potential de- creased slowly (steady state value after 1 h). Addition of TMP increased the rate of catalyst reduction without changing the final value, which was about 40 mV lower than that mea- sured in the absence of co-catalyst. Similarly, a 40 mV negative shift was observed between the electrochemical potentials of model mixtures B and C (Table 21, which is due to the effect of co-catalyst. The negative potential shift is likely due to complex formation between catalyst and co-catalyst. Comparison of the data in Table 2 indicates that the co-catalyst had a dual effect: it reduced the potential (i) by reducing the oxida- tion state of the catalyst and (ii) by complexa- tion. As soon as the oxidant was dropped into the reaction mixture, the electrochemical (mixed) potential rose up to 560-600 mV and did not decrease during reaction (2 h), in agreement with the continuous presence of some TBHP detected by gas chromatography. No unambigu- ous difference in the electrochemical potential could be recognised in the presence or absence of co-catalyst, likely because the mixed poten- tial is determined mainly by the oxidant. 4. Discussion Our study demonstrates that the oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,6-trimethyl- 1,4-benzoquinone (TMQ) can be performed with a catalytic amount of CuCl,. A yield of 80% at full conversion was obtained at a catalyst turnover of about 100 without optimising the reaction parameters. Considering the yield of TMQ and the amount of catalyst (without recy- cling), the method is superior to other known processes. The good performance of CuCl, necessitates the presence of NH,OH - HCl co-catalyst and the use of tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) as oxidant. The role of co-catalyst is not fully understood yet. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the co-catalyst plays a dual role: it reduces the Cu*+ catalyst to Cuf and forms a complex with the latter. The reduction seems to be of minor importance as TMP reduces Cu*+ more rapidly. The role of NH,OH . HCl as co-catalyst is most probably to promote the further oxidation of the intermediate (dimers) to TMQ. A comparison of several catalysts and co- catalysts uncovered the crucial role of Cl- ions. The presence of Cl- ions can be important in the Cu*+/Cu+ transformation and also in the complexation of the catalyst, but the consider- able formation of 4-chloro-2,3,6-trimethylphe- no1 (ClTMP, Scheme 2) as an intermediate could be excluded, when only small a amount of CuCl, catalyst is used. Our catalytic study indicates that the likely intermediates of the TMP + TMQ transforma- tion are dimers: 2,23,36,6hexamethyl-4,4 biphenyldiol (D) and 2,23,36,6hexamethyl- 4,4biphenylquinone (DQ), as shown in Scheme 2. Dimers are possibly formed by abstraction of a phenolic proton from TMP and by subsequent tautomerisation, dimerisation and oxidation [ 141. Electrochemical and catalytic investigations dis- closed that the reaction of TMP with CuCl, in AcOH is fast and the decomposition of dimers to produce TMQ is slow, especially when only stoichiometric or even lower amounts of TBHP are used. Direct hydroxylation of TMP to 2,3,6-trimethyl- 1,4-hydroquinone (TMHQ, Scheme 2) is also found to be unlikely under the reaction conditions. Cut ions, which formed by interaction with TMP and NH,OH . HCl, are reoxidised by TBHP, while generating HO. radicals which are important in the oxidation process. It seems to be crucial, that none of the redox cycles (the interaction of catalyst with TMP and its oxi- dised intermediates, and with the oxidant) is hindered under the very mild reaction condi- tions which enables the use of catalytic amount of CuCl, . 2. Bodnar et al. / Journal of Molecular Cma1mi.y A: Chemical I IO (19961 55-6.3 63 5. Conclusions The oxidation of 2,3,6_trimethylphenol to 2,3,6-trimethyl- ,4-benzoquinone with the -(Curl,-NH,0H e Hci-mHP4~oH)- SYS- tern affording 80% yield provides an alternative to the CuCl,-catalysed aerobic oxidation. The advantage of the former is that only a catalytic (instead of stoichiometric) amount of CuCl, is necessary, whereas the drawback is the use of a more expensive oxidant (TBHP). The TMQ yield achieved so far could be further improved by optimising the reaction conditions, particu- larly by fine tuning the dosing of TMP which was found to have significant effect.

Tel.: (+41-1)6323153; fax.: (+41-1)6321163 The selective, one step oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TMQ) by a catalytic amount of CuCl2 (up to 100 turnovers) and NH2OH · HCl has been investigated. TMQ was obtained in up to 80% yield using only 1.5 wt% CuCl2 catalyst (related to the amount of TMP) and 2.8 wt% NH2OH · HCl co-catalyst under ambient conditions. The initial oxidation state of copper had no influence on the rate or selectivity of the reaction. The synergy between catalyst and co-catalyst was most prominent in the low concentration range. Highest TMQ yield was obtained with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), whereas the use of molecular oxygen (under pressure) resulted in relatively poor yield. At low TBHP TMP ratio, the dimer content of the product is significant, but can be efficiently suppressed by applying the oxidant in 10–25 mol% excess to the stoichiometric ratio. The TMQ yield could be improved by adding TMP in portions during oxidation, and by using TBHP in air instead of nitrogen atmosphere. The presence of Cl− ion proved to be important for obtaining good selectivity, but the formation of 4-chloro-2,3,6-trimethylphenol as an intermediate can be excluded, when the amount of catalyst is less than 3 wt%. Electrochemical and catalytic investigations revealed that the reduction of Cu2+ by TMP and its reoxidation by TBHP are fast, but the further oxidation of the dimer intermediate to TMQ is slow.
