DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60196-9 Dual-Templating Preparation and Enhanced Low-Temperature Reducibility of Three-Dimensionally Ordered Macroporous Ceria with Mesoporous Walls ZHANG Han, ZHANG Lei, DENG Jiguang, LIU Yuxi, JIANG Haiyan, SHI Fengjuan, JI Kemeng, DAI Hongxing* Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China Abstract: Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) ceria with mesoporous walls and cubic crystal structures were prepared with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a hard template and triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (EO 106 PO 70 EO 106 ), cetyltrimethylam- monium bromide (CTAB) , or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a soft template. Citric acid was used as a complexing agent and cerium nitrate was used as a metal precursor. The 3DOM CeO 2 samples were characterized by numerous analytical techniques. The as-fabricated CeO 2 samples had a 3DOM architecture with polycrystalline wormhole-like mesoporous walls. The nature of the soft template had an important effect on the pore structure and the surface area of the final product. The surface areas of the F127-, CTAB-, and PEG-derived 3DOM CeO 2 samples (denoted CeO 2 -F127, CeO 2 -CTAB, and CeO 2 -PEG, respectively) were ca. 60.5, 60.2, and 51.8 m 2 /g, respectively. The low-temperature reducibility of the 3DOM-structured CeO 2 samples was much better than that of the bulk counterpart and the low-temperature reducibility of the three 3DOM ceria samples increased according to: CeO 2 -PEG < CeO 2 -CTAB < CeO 2 -F127, which coincided with the surface oxygen vacancy density sequence. The improved physicochemical properties associated with the formation of the 3DOM skeleton with wormhole-like mesoporous walls may be useful for applications such as CeO 2 materials in heterogeneous ca- talysis. Key words: dual-templating preparation method; three-dimensionally ordered macropore; ceria; low-temperature reducibility; worm- hole-like mesoporous wall; surfactant Ceria is a catalytic material that is used in the chemical and petrochemical industries [1]. Because of the good oxygen storage capacity (OSC) associated with the rich oxygen va- cancies and the low redox potential between Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ , CeO 2 has been used as a promoter in three-way catalysts for the removal of automotive exhaust gases [2â€“4] and as a catalyst for the reforming and partial oxidation of methane and the wa- ter-gas shift during â€œon boardâ€� hydrogen production [2,4]. Ceria is also applied as an optical material in high-temperature ceramics, as oxygen sensors, and as fuel cells [5â€“7]. Porous ceria with good porosity, a high surface area, a narrow pore-size distribution, and good reducibility is expected to possess improved properties. Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) mate- rials have attracted a large amount of attention lately because of their potential use as battery materials, sensors, catalysts or supports, and biomaterials [8,9]. To date, the colloidal crystal templating method is a commonly adopted pathway to obtain 3DOM materials with metals (Ni, Co, Fe, and Ni 1â€“x Co x ) [10], metal oxides (MgO, Cr 2 O 3 , Mn 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , Co 3 O 4 , NiO, ZnO, and CaCO 3 ) [11], mixed metal oxides (CsAlTiO 4 , MgAl 2 O 4 , MgFe 2 O 4 , and In 2â€“x Mg x O 3 ) [9,12], and perovskite-type oxides (LaFeO 3 and La 1â€“x Sr x FeO 3 ) [13,14]. 3DOM-structured CeO 2 possesses an ordered pore architecture and a high surface area, ZHANG Han et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 842â€“852 which gives these materials unique physicochemical proper- ties. Therefore, it is highly desirable to establish an effective strategy for the controlled preparation of 3DOM CeO 2 . Several reports exist about the fabrication of 3DOM CeO 2 . For exam- ple, Wu et al. [15] prepared 3DOM CeO 2 using well-aligned polystyrene (PS) microspheres as a hard template and cerium nitrate as a metal precursor. Waterhouse et al. [16] used poly- methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a hard template and cerium nitrate as a cerium source to generate a 3DOM CeO 2 material with a surface area of 51 m 2 /g. With PS as a hard template and cerium and/or copper nitrates as a metal precursor, Zhang et al. obtained 3DOM CeO 2 with a surface area of 38â€“41 m 2 /g [17] and 3DOM CuO-CeO 2 with a surface area of 24 m 2 /g [18]. Obviously, the surface areas of these 3DOM materials are relatively low. Previously, our group investigated the synthesis, charac- terization, and physicochemical properties of various 3DOM-structured materials with high surface areas such as MgO (surface area = 243 m 2 /g), È–-Al 2 O 3 (surface area = 145 m 2 /g), Ce 1 x Zr x O 2 (surface area = 100 m 2 /g) [19], and SiO 2 (surface area = 663 m 2 /g) [20] using the surfactant- and/or the citric acid-assisted PMMA-templating method. We found that the introduction of a surfactant or citric acid during the syn- thesis process is beneficial for the formation of mesoporous walls and thus for the synthesis of 3DOM-structured materials with the desired physicochemical properties [19,20]. Recently, we extended our attention to the fabrication of 3DOM- struc- tured rare earth oxides with high surface areas. In this work, we report a facile dual-templating preparation method to obtain a 3DOM-structured CeO 2 material with wormhole-like mesoporous walls and excellent low-temperature reducibility by employing PMMA as a hard template and the triblock co- polymer Pluronic F127 (EO 106 PO 70 EO 106 ), cetyltrimethylam- monium bromide (CTAB), or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a soft template. Citric acid was used as the complexing agent and cerium nitrate was used as the metal precursor. We found that the 3DOM CeO 2 derived with F127 had the highest surface area of ca. 61 m 2 /g and the best low-temperature reducibility. 1 Experimental 1.1 Fabrication of 3DOM-structured CeO 2 with worm- hole-like mesoporous walls Uniform monodispersed PMMA colloid crystal micro- spheres with an average pore diameter of 298 nm were syn- thesized using the method described previously [19]. 3DOM-structured CeO 2 with mesoporous walls were prepared using the surfactant-assisted PMMA-templating strategy. Typical fabrication procedures were as follows. 1.0 g of Plu- ronic F127 or PEG-10000 or 0.1 g of CTAB, 2.1 g of citric acid, and 4.34 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O were dissolved in 10.0 g of ethanol aqueous solution (40 wt%) while stirring. After disso- lution, 2.0 g of highly ordered PMMA colloidal crystal mi- crospheres was added and suspended in the above mixed solu- tion. After the PMMA microspheres were thoroughly wetted, the excessive liquid was filtered using a Buchner funnel con- nected to a vacuum (0.07 MPa). After drying at room tem- perature (RT) for 24 h, the 3DOM materials were obtained by calcination in air at a heating rate of 1 Â°C/min from RT to 300 and 500 Â°C and maintained at these two temperatures for 3 and 5 h, respectively. The obtained samples were denoted CeO 2 -F127, CeO 2 -PEG, and CeO 2 -CTAB, respectively. The bulk ceria (denoted bulk-CeO 2 ) sample was also prepared by calcining a certain amount of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â˜6H 2 O in air at 500 Â°C for 5 h for comparison. All the chemicals used in this work were from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company and were of analytical grade and used without further purification. 1.2 Sample characterization The crystal structures of the samples were determined using a Bruker/AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) op- erated at 40 kV and 35 mA with Cu K Ä® radiation and a nickel filter (Èœ = 0.15406 nm). The crystal phases were identified by referring to standard XRD data from the JCPDS database. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis of the uncalcined samples were carried out on a SDT Q600 (TA) apparatus in an air flow of 100 ml/min from RT to 900 Â°C using a ramp of 10 Â°C/min. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded on a Gemini Zeiss Supra 55 operated at 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images as well as selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the samples were ob- tained using a JEOL JEM-2010. The surface areas of the sam- ples were measured by N 2 adsorption at 196 ÂºC on a Micro- meritics ASAP 2020 adsorption analyzer. Before measure- ment, the samples were outgassed at 250 Â°C for 3 h. The sur- face areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore-size distributions of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples were determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry (Autopore IV 9510). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG CLAM 4 MCD Analyzer) was used to determine the Ce 3d, O 1s, and C 1s binding energies (E b ) of the surface species with Mg K D (hÈž = 1253.6 eV) as the excitation source. Before XPS analysis, the samples were calcined in O 2 (flow rate = 20 ml/min) at 500 Â°C for 1 h and then cooled to RT. After this pretreatment, the samples were mounted and transferred to a spectrometer in a transparent glove bag (Instruments for Re- search and Industry, USA) that was filled with helium. The samples were then outgassed in the preparation chamber (1.33 u 10 3 Pa) for 0.5 h and placed in the analysis chamber (4 u 10 7 Pa) for spectrum recording. The C 1s signal at 284.6 eV was taken as a reference for E b calibration. Hydrogen tempera- ture-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) experiments were con- ZHANG Han et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 842â€“852 ducted on a chemical adsorption analyzer (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics). Before the TPR measurement, 30 mg of the CeO 2 sample was first treated in an air flow of 30 ml/min at 450 Â°C for 1 h in a quartz fixed-bed U-shaped microreactor (i.d. = 4 mm). After cooling to RT in the same atmosphere, the pre- treated sample was exposed to a 50 ml/min flow of a 5% H 2 -95% Ar (v/v) mixture and heated to 900 Â°C at a ramp of 10 Â°C/min. The change in H 2 concentration of the effluent was monitored on-line by a chemical adsorption analyzer. The reduction band was calibrated by the complete reduction of standard powdered CuO (Aldrich, 99.995%). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Crystal structure Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the 3DOM CeO 2 sam- ples prepared under different conditions. By comparison to a XRD pattern of a standard CeO 2 sample (JCPDS 34-0394) the XRD lines of all of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples were well in- dexed, as indicated in Fig. 1(3). Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the as-fabricated CeO 2 samples possess a cubic crystal structure. Small differences in diffraction intensity were apparent for the three 3DOM CeO 2 samples indicating that they possessed similar crystallinity. Figure 2 shows the TGA/DSC profiles of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples before calcination in air at high temperature. For the uncalcined CeO 2 -F127 sample (Fig. 2(a)), a small weight loss (ca. 6.6 wt%) was apparent below 210 Â°C, and this was as- signable to the removal of adsorbed water [21]. This was ac- companied by the appearance of an endothermic peak at 136 Â°C and two significant weight losses (ca. 62.8 wt% in the 210â€“335 Â°C range and ca. 24.7 wt% in the 335â€“390 Â°C range) because of the thermal decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and the elimination of the F127 and PMMA templates [10,11,22]. This was in addi- tion to the endothermic peaks at 332 and 354 Â°C, respectively. Since PMMA microspheres dissociate at ca. 290 Â°C and be- come oxygenolyzed at around 363 Â°C it is reasonable to as- sume that the PMMA template could be totally removed below 400 Â°C. For the uncalcined CeO 2 -CTAB sample (Fig. 2(b)), a weight loss of ca. 5.0 wt% below 240 Â°C because of the re- moval of adsorbed water in addition to an endothermic peak at 146 Â°C was evident. The other two weight losses of ca. 80.0 wt% in the 240 355 Â°C range and ca. 11.0 wt% in the 355â€“406 Â°C range is attributed to the thermal decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and the elimination of the CTAB and PMMA tem- plates, which corresponds to the endothermic peaks at 341 and 361 Â°C, respectively. As for the uncalcined CeO 2 -PEG sample (Fig. 2(c)), a weight loss of ca. 6.8 wt% below 240 Â°C because of adsorbed water removal (with the appearance of a weak endothermic signal at 143 Â°C) and two weight losses of ca. 40.5 wt% in the 240â€“323 Â°C range and ca. 48.5 wt% in the 323â€“395 Â°C range is attributed to the thermal decomposition of 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 (420) (331) (400)(222) (311) (220) (200) (111) 2T /( o ) I n t e n s i t y (3) (2) (1) Fig. 1.

These results indicate that the final calcination tempera- ture (500 Â°C) used in this work was high enough for the re- moval of the hard and soft templates and for the formation of single-phase cubic 3DOM CeO 2 . 2.2 Morphology, pore structure, and surface area Figure 3 shows representative SEM and TEM images as well as SAED patterns of the as-prepared CeO 2 samples. We ob- served that all the samples had a high-quality 3DOM structure with macropore sizes of 50â€“200 nm, and the typical wall thickness was in the range of 15 40 nm. The walls of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples were composed of relatively uniform nanoparticles (diameter = 4â€“10 nm) among which numerous wormhole-like mesopores (diameter = 2â€“5 nm) were present. As can be seen from the high-resolution TEM images (Figs. 3(d), (h), and (l)), there were well-resolved lattice fringes with lattice spacings (d value) of the (111) plane being 0.312 nm for each of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples. This is rather close to that (0.31234 nm, JCPDS 34-0394) of the standard cubic CeO 2 sample. Furthermore, the recording of multiple bright electron diffraction rings in the SAED patterns (insets of Figs. 3(b), (f), and (j)) means that all the 3DOM CeO 2 samples were poly- crystalline. Figure 4(a) shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples.

ZHANG Han et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 842â€“852 type II isotherm with a big H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (p/p 0 ) range of 0.8â€“1.0. They also have a small H2 type hysteresis loop in the p/p 0 range of 0.2â€“0.8. The H3 hys- teresis loop, which did not clearly show any adsorption plateau at p/p 0 close to unity is related to the existence of slit-shaped pores in the materials, which is indicative of a pore-size dis- tribution that extends to the macropore range [23]. The low-pressure portion of the almost linear middle section of the isotherm, which can be attributed to unrestricted mono- or multilayer adsorption suggests that the samples were macro- porous [11]. The H2 hysteresis loop in the p/p 0 range of 0.2â€“0.8, linkable to the capillary condensation taking place in mesopores indicates that mesopores exist in the wall structure [11,23â€“25]. This was confirmed by the results of TEM inves- tigations (Fig. 3). Figure 4(b) shows the pore-size distributions of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples that were measured by Hg po- rosimetry. Each of the three samples exhibited a rather narrow pore-size distribution centered at ca. 4â€“5 nm and a broad pore-size distribution that was scattered from 50 to 200 nm. The BET surface areas and pore-size distributions of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples that were synthesized under different conditions are summarized in Table 1. We found that the nature of the surfactant had an impact on the textural property of the samples. The 3DOM CeO 2 samples had surface areas of 51.8â€“60.5 m 2 /g with the CeO 2 -F127 and CeO 2 -CTAB samples having higher surface areas. The discrepancy in surface area might be associated with the difference in the mesoporous wall structures of the 3DOM CeO 2 materials, which were dependent on the nature of the surfactant adopted. For the CeO 2 -F127, CeO 2 -CTAB, and CeO 2 -PEG samples, the average mesopore diameter was ca. 3.9, 4.9, and 4.3 nm, respectively. The cor- responding macropore diameter was ca. 130, 125, and 120 nm. The presence of wormhole-like mesopores that formed because of the aggregation of CeO 2 nanoparticles in the walls of the samples was responsible for the increase in surface area (Table 1). 2.3 Oxygen species, cerium oxidation state, and oxygen vacancy density Figure 5 illustrates the O 1s and Ce 3d XPS spectra of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples. Figure 5(a) shows that the O 1s spec- trum of each of the 3DOM CeO 2 samples could be deconvo- luted into two components at E b = 529.4 and 531.7 eV, which is attributable to the surface lattice oxygen (O latt ) and the ad- sorbed oxygen (O ads , e.g. O , O 2 2 , or O 2 ) species [26], re- spectively. The O ads species are usually present at the oxygen vacancies of CeO 2 . A large amount of O ads species implies a higher oxygen vacancy density. The surface O ads /O latt molar ratio decreased as follows: CeO 2 -F127 > CeO 2 -CTAB >> CeO 2 -PEG (Table 2). In other words, the CeO 2 -F127 and CeO 2 -CTAB samples possessed much higher surface oxygen vacancy densities than the CeO 2 -PEG sample. Figure 5(b) shows that two sets of signals are present: one set centered at E b = 882.8, 885.6, 889.2, and 898.7 eV, assignable to Ce 3d 5/2 , and the other centered at E b = 901.3, 903.1, 907.6, and 917.0 eV, assignable to Ce 3d 3/2 [26â€“29]. The signals at E b = 885.6 and 903.1 eV are due to Ce 3+ whereas those at the other E b s are due to Ce 4+ [26,27,29]. As shown in Table 2, the surface Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ molar ratio increases as follows: CeO 2 -PEG << CeO 2 -CTAB < CeO 2 -F127. This order suggests that there are larger amounts of surface oxygen vacancies on the CeO 2 -CTAB and CeO 2 -F127 samples than on the CeO 2 -PEG sample. This is in good agreement with the O 1s XPS results.

ZHANG Han et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 842â€“852 surface oxygen vacancy density of these samples is due to the difference in the surface cerium oxidation state distribution, which might be induced by surfactants (soft templates) of different nature. It is well accepted that the presence of oxygen vacancies is favorable for an improvement in the reducibility of ceria [26,27]. Therefore, the CeO 2 -CTAB and CeO 2 -F127 samples are expected to have much better reducibility than the CeO 2 -PEG sample, as substantiated by the TPR results below. 2.4 Reducibility Figure 6 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the bulk and 3DOM CeO 2 samples. Two reduction steps are present for each sam- ple: a low-temperature step in the range of 250â€“550 Â°C and a high-temperature step in the range of 550â€“850 Â°C. The bulk CeO 2 sample showed one rather weak and broad reduction band centered at 420 Â°C and one weak reduction band centered at 800 Â°C. Its H 2 consumption was 290 and 177 È�mol/g, re- spectively. The 3DOM CeO 2 samples had similar reduction features. (i) One sharp reduction band is present at 470 Â°C with a shoulder at 360 Â°C, which suggests the existence of at least two kinds of cerium species in the different coordination en- vironments and the H 2 consumption was 740, 725, and 700 È�mol/g for the 3DOM-structured CeO 2 -F127, CeO 2 -CTAB, and CeO 2 -PEG samples, respectively. (ii) One broad reduction band is centered at 780 Â°C and the corresponding H 2 con- sumption is 610, 477, and 392 È�mol/g. The low- temperature reduction band is attributable to the reduction of surface Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ as well as the removal of a small amount of oxygen adspecies [26,30â€“32] whereas the high-temperature reduction band is attributable to the reduction of bulk Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ [26,32]. Based on the H 2 consumption of these samples, the low-temperature reducibility increased as follows: bulk-CeO 2 << CeO 2 -PEG < CeO 2 -CTAB < CeO 2 -F127. These results indicate that the pore structure and morphology significantly affect the low-temperature reducibility of CeO 2 . In other words, the presence of the 3DOM architecture with worm- hole-like mesoporous walls is beneficial for the low-temperature reducibility of the ceria material. 3 Conclusions Using the dual-templating strategy with PMMA as a hard template and F127, CTAB, or PEG individually as soft tem- plates, citric acid as a complexing agent and cerium nitrate as a metal source, it is possible to generate 3DOM-structured CeO 2 materials with wormhole-like mesoporous walls. The nature of the soft template greatly influences the morphology and porous structure of the obtained CeO 2 samples. The addition of a certain amount of F127, CTAB, or PEG to the precursor solu- tion during the preparation process can markedly enhance the 526 528 530 532 534 536 880 890 900 910 920 (2) (3) Binding energy (eV) I n t e n s i t y O 1s (1) (a) (3) (2) Binding energy (eV) I n t e n s i t y Ce 3d (1) (b) Fig. 5.

ZHANG Han et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 842â€“852 surface area of the 3DOM ceria sample. The 3DOM-structured ceria samples have much better low-temperature reducibility than their bulk counterparts. Among the three 3DOM ceria samples, the low-temperature reducibility increased as fol- lows: CeO 2 -PEG < CeO 2 -CTAB < CeO 2 -F127. This order is in good agreement with their surface oxygen vacancy density order. The unique physicochemical properties and behavior related to the presence of 3DOM architecture with worm- hole-like mesoporous walls can potentially be used in hetero- geneous catalysis.

Citric acid was used as a complexing agent and cerium nitrate was used as a metal precursor. The 3DOM CeO2 samples were characterized by numerous analytical techniques. The as-fabricated CeO2 samples had a 3DOM architecture with polycrystalline wormhole-like mesoporous walls. The nature of the soft template had an important effect on the pore structure and the surface area of the final product. The surface areas of the F127-, CTAB-, and PEG-derived 3DOM CeO2 samples (denoted CeO2-F127, CeO2-CTAB, and CeO2-PEG, respectively) were ca. 60.5, 60.2, and 51.8 m2/g, respectively. The low-temperature reducibility of the 3DOM-structured CeO2 samples was much better than that of the bulk counterpart and the low-temperature reducibility of the three 3DOM ceria samples increased according to: CeO2-PEG < CeO2-CTAB < CeO2-F127, which coincided with the surface oxygen vacancy density sequence.
