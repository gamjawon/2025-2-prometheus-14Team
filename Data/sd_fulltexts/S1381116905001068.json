Graphical abstract The effect of iron on the structure and catalytic performance was investigated by comparison of iron-promoted and un-promoted catalysts calcined at different temperature. It was found that, when the catalysts were calcined at different temperature, the change of metal-support interaction strongly influenced the surface and crystal structure of the catalysts and hence its catalytic performance. Low calcination temperature yielded poorly crystallized catalysts and favored the formation of a Cu(OH)2-like structure, which was highly dispersed. For the CuMnZrO2 catalyst, with the rise of calcination temperature, surface area and dispersion of copper decreased, and the crystallization of zirconia occurred. Nevertheless, the TOF showed a maximum on the catalyst calcined at 873K due to the increase of the copper–zirconia interaction. The presence of iron could suppress agglomeration of copper species and crystallization of amorphous zirconia. The dispersion of copper was enhanced. However, overall catalytic activity was suppressed. On the one hand, the increase of iron–zirconia interaction with the rise of calcination temperature suppressed the interaction between copper species and zirconia. On the other hand, the interaction between iron and zirconia hindered the reduction of iron oxide, and then copper–iron interaction weakened, which reduced the active sites for higher alcohol formation. The structure and catalytic performance of CuMnZrO2 and Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts, which were calcined at different temperature, were investigated by BET, XRD, N2O-titration, XANES, EXAFS and TPR. It was found that the calcination temperature strongly influenced the interaction between the active species and support and hence the structure and catalytic performance. Low calcination temperature yielded poorly crystallized catalysts and favored the formation of a Cu(OH)2-like structure. The presence of iron could suppress crystallization of amorphous zirconia and increased the dispersion of copper due to the iron–zirconia interaction within the rise of calcination temperature from 623 to 873K. However, the addition of iron resulted in the decrease of catalytic activity and selectivity. This could be explained by strong iron–zirconia interaction. It led to the decrease of copper–zirconia interaction, which was responsible for the methanol synthesis, and the decrease of copper–iron interaction, which was responsible for the formation of higher alcohols. Keywords Structure Fe-CuMnZrO2 Higher alcohols Calcination temperature 1 Introduction The production of C1–C6 alcohol mixtures can be considered as a possible added value pathway for natural gas passing through the intermediacy of syngas [1]. The obtained alcohols have been proposed for various utilizations such as solvent, fuel, or additives such as octane boosters in gasoline [2]. Among the several categories of catalysts for mixed alcohols synthesis [3,4], Fischer–Tropsch elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Ru) modified copper based catalysts have drawn a widely attention because of their high activity and selectivity, such as Co-CuZnOAl2O3 [5–7], Co-CuZnCr [8] and Co-CuLaZrO2 catalysts [9]. Those researches showed that the synergism was the result of interaction between cobalt and copper [10]. The cobalt was thought to provide the CC chain growth, while copper would be responsible for chain termination [7]. Moreover, Bailliard–Letournel et al. [11] found that the interaction of copper and cobalt in Cu-Co catalysts led to a surface alloy, and proposed that such an alloy was responsible for the high selectivity to alcohols. But the metal-support interaction or cobalt alumina spinel phase formation could strongly inhibit the interaction between copper and cobalt [12], and the preparation parameters were found to have the greatly influence on the formation of copper–cobalt phase or cobalt alumina spinel phase [13]. In our earlier research, we found that the Fischer–Tropsch elements (Fe, Co, Ni) modified CuZrO2 catalysts showed relatively high activity and selectivity for mixed alcohols synthesis [14]. It was thought that the CuM (MFe, Co, Ni) phases were the active sites for higher alcohol formation. The effect of iron on the adsorption properties of CuMnZrO2 catalysts was investigated used TPD and FTIR spectroscopy in our previous paper [15]. It was found that the adsorption features of catalysts changed significantly with the addition of iron. The interactions that took place among the active phases or between the metal and support generally influenced the surface and structural properties of the catalyst and hence the catalytic performance. However, the catalysts system of Fe-CuMnZrO2 was quite complex and made it difficult to understand the interaction between different components. In the present work, the effect of calcination temperature on CuMnZrO2 and Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts was investigated to establish the influence of iron on the structure of catalyst and to obtain the information on the interaction between different components. Catalytic performance was discussed in relation to the structures of the catalysts, which were clarified by the combination of BET, N2O-adsorption, XRD, XANES, EXAFS and H2-TPR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts CuMnZrO2 catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation of a solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Mn(NO3)2, and ZrOCl2·8H2O with an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 at 343K and a constant pH of 10 in a well-stirred thermo-stated container. Then the precipitates were aged at 343K for 2h. After washed thoroughly with distilled water, the precipitates were dried at 393K for 12h, and then calcined at different temperatures in air for 3h. Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts were prepared using the same procedure as for CuMnZrO2, except that Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was introduced into the mixed solution. The composition of so-produced catalysts was as follows: Cu:Mn:Zr:Fe=1:0.5:2:0.1 (molar ratio). 2.2 Characterization of catalysts The BET surface areas of catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption at 77K using the Tristar 3000 chemical adsorption instrument (Micromeritics). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max diffractorments with a Cu target and Ni filter. Elemental analysis was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Atomscan 16). For the CuMnZrO2 catalysts and Fe modified catalysts, the Na content was in the range of 0.02–0.05%. The copper surface area (S Cu) was determined by using a nitrous oxide pulse method as described by Evans et al. [16]. The sample was placed in a quartz tube reactor and reduced in flowing hydrogen. After reduction, the gas flow was switched to argon and the temperature was lowered down to 353K. A pulse of nitrous oxide was introduced into the argon flow by means of a calibrated sample valve. The exit gas was analyzed by mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 200). The amount of surface copper was calculated from the amount of nitrogen evolved, assuming the dissociation of nitrous oxide takes place on surface copper followed the equation (average atom density: 1.49×1019 atomsm−2): (1) N2O(g)+2Cus =N2(g)+(CuOCu)s N2O did not decompose on FeMnZrO2 catalyst pre-reduced at 623K, suggesting that any reduced iron species and manganese species presented not decompose N2O at 353K. X-ray adsorption spectra (XAFS) around the Cu K-adsorption edge were obtained using the beamline of 1W1B of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The storage ring was operated at 2.5GeV with a typical current of 40–60mA. The fixed-exit Si(111) flat double crystals were used as monochromator. A sampling step of 0.5eV for the XANES part of the spectra and a variable sampling step for EXAFS part were adopted. Spectra were collected at room temperature. EXAFS data were processed using the program for EXAFS data analysis written by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Temperature program reduction (TPR) was carried out in a U-tube quartz reactor. The samples (50mg) were flushed with an argon flow of 50cm3 min−1 at 393K to remove water and then reduced in a flow of hydrogen–argon mixture (containing 5vol.% of hydrogen) at a rate of 10Kmin−1 with a programmable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity cell (TCD) attached to a gas chromatograph (GC-950). The effluent gas was passed through a cold trap placed before TCD in order to remove water from the exit stream of the reactor. 2.3 Activity measurements The activity tests were conducted with a fixed-bed, stainless flow micro reactor. All catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen–nitrogen mixture (containing 5vol.% of hydrogen) flow at 573K and atmospheric pressure before exposure to syngas. The steady-state activity measurements were taken after at least 48h on the stream. The analysis of the gaseous and liquid products was made by Shimazu-8A gas chromatographs. H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were determined by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped with a TDX-101 column. The water and methanol in liquids were also detected by TCD with a GDX-401 column. The alcohols and hydrocarbons were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) with a Porapak-Q column. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural and structural properties of catalysts The BET surface area of CuMnZrO2 catalysts decreased continuously with the rise of calcination temperature, while the pore volume decreased and the average pore size increased (see Table 1 ). Particularly, when the calcination temperature was increased from 873 to 1073K, the surface area decreased sharply from 82 to 9m2 g−1. At the same time, the pore size increased from 11.2 to 30.4nm. This was due to that metallic oxide particles shrink and agglomeration when they were calcined at high temperature. Compared with CuMnZrO2, the presence of iron could inhibit the metallic oxide particles agglomeration. The surface area of Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst was 171m2 g−1 at 723K and 116m2 g−1 at 873K, which were higher than the unprompted catalyst. The copper dispersion measured by N2O decomposition on catalysts was shown in Fig. 1 . For the CuMnZrO2, the copper dispersion was 5.7% when calcined at 623K and decreased monotonously with the rise of calcination temperature. The presence of iron favored the formation of small copper metal crystallites on supports. The copper dispersion of Fe-CuMnZrO2 calcined at 623K was 6.6%. Moreover, the copper dispersion of Fe-CuMnZrO2 slightly increased with the rise of calcination temperature from 623 to 873K. This indicated that iron could increase the interaction between copper species and supports, which favored the dispersion of copper species. As Huang et al. [17] revealed, the re-dispersion of copper species took place during the process of calcination because of the interaction between copper species and supports. But such an improvement was limited, the copper species aggregated seriously when the catalyst was calcined above 1073K, which led to a drastic decrease in the copper dispersion. The X-ray diffraction pattern of CuMnZrO2 catalysts did not show any peaks when the catalysts were calcined below 723K, indicating that the active phase could be well dispersed on amorphous zirconia (see Fig. 2A). The crystallite sizes were not enough large to be detected by X-ray. For the catalyst calcined at 873K, the peaks at 2θ =30.2° corresponding to the diffraction of tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2), and the peaks at 2θ =28.3° and 31.3° corresponding to the diffraction of monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) were observed. Moreover, the CuMnZrO2 catalysts became much well crystallized at 1073K. The diffraction peaks of m-ZrO2 were predominant and the peaks of t-ZrO2 became very weak. CuO exhibited major peaks at 2θ =38.7° and 35.5°, while CuMn2O4 showed a peak at 2θ =63.2°. This indicated that the zirconia was mainly in monoclinic phase and the active species aggregated seriously at that calcination temperature. The presence of iron greatly influenced the crystallinity of Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts. Compared with CuMnZrO2, the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts exhibited an amorphous-like or less well-ordered structure feature even if the calcination temperature was 873K (see Fig. 2B). This suggested that the presence of iron suppressed the crystallization of zirconia. After the catalyst was calcined at 1073K, several sharp peaks appeared. Different from CuMnZrO2 catalyst, the diffraction peaks of t-ZrO2 were still strong, indicating that the t-ZrO2 phase was still a big fraction in the zirconia. This meant that the presence of iron could inhibit the crystal phase transformation of zirconia. Moreover, it was noteworthy that the CuFe2O4 phase exhibited a major peak at 2θ =35.6°. This result demonstrated that the interaction between iron and copper increased by formation of spinel compound. 3.2 XANES and EXAFS of catalysts The XANES of the Cu K-edge of Cu catalysts have been measured to reveal the structure and electronic state of the Cu species [18–22]. Fig. 3 shows Cu K-edge XANES spectra of CuMnZrO2 and iron-modified catalysts. The XANES spectra of reference compounds, CuO (Cu2+ in a square planar symmetry) and Cu(OH)2 (Cu2+ in an octahedral symmetry) were shown in Fig. 4 for the comparison. The CuMnZrO2 catalysts calcined at 623 and 723K showed very close XANES spectra to that for Cu(OH)2, indicating that the major Cu2+ species in the catalysts were in an octahedral symmetry, surrounded by six O2− anions (see Fig. 3A). The presence of a weak 1s→3d pre-peak at 8977eV supported the conclusion [23,24]. On the other hand, clear humps appeared at 8986 and 9013eV on CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 873K and their intensity increased with the rise of calcination temperature. Since CuO showed similar characteristic peaks in the XANES spectrum as presented in Fig. 4, it suggested that CuO clusters would produce at the temperature higher than 873K. Generally, the CuO species (Cu2+ in a square planar symmetry) would produce in supported Cu catalysts after calcination in air, such as Cu/α-Al2O3, Cu/SiO2 and Cu/TiO2, because CuO was more stable than Cu(OH)2. But in the present study, a structure of Cu(OH)2 was observed. In Cheah et al. [25] research on the Cu/amorphous SiO2 catalysts, they also found that Cu(OH)2 produced on the amorphous SiO2 surface. A possible explanation was that the surface energy of CuO was larger than that of Cu(OH)2. Consequently, Cu(OH)2 would become the more stable phase when the precipitating particle sizes were small enough that surface energy was an important contribution to the free energy [26]. On the other hand, Okamoto et al. [27] investigated calcined CuZrO2 catalysts using XANES and FTIR, suggesting that the highly dispersed copper species were formed by the reaction of copper oxides with the hydroxy groups on zirconia, moreover, Cu(OH)2 species was detected in the catalyst. In present study, the amorphous zirconia support had abundant surface hydroxyl as many papers had reported [28]. Therefore, the highly-dispersed copper species could have a strong interaction with these surface hydroxy groups and favor the formation of Cu(OH)2. When the amorphous phase transformed to t-ZrO2 or m-ZrO2 at higher calcination temperature, the reduction of surface hydroxy groups led to the decrease of interaction between copper and zirconia. The copper species began to agglomeration. Thus, the CuO cluster formed on the support and dispersion decreased obviously. This was in conformity with the N2O-titration and XRD results. However, for the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts, their XANES spectra showed similar to that for Cu(OH)2 even calcined at 873K (see Fig. 3B). This indicated that iron could enhance the stability of Cu(OH)2 species by stabilizing the amorphous phase of zirconia at high temperature. Fig. 5 showed the background subtracted k 3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, k 3 χ (k), for CuMnZrO2 and Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts calcined at different temperature. For CuMnZrO2 catalysts calcined at either 873 or 1073K, fine structures characteristic of CuO all appeared at 8.0 and 8.5Å−1, while the same phenomenon appeared for Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 1073K. This was in agreement with the XANES results in Fig. 3. The corresponding partial radial distribution functions (partial RDFs) obtained by Fourier transforms of k 3 χ (k) were shown in Fig. 6 (Δk =3.0–11.5Å−1). The Δk values were restricted to be relatively narrow, because the Hf L3-edge (9561eV) of HfO2 (present as an impurity in the ZrO2 used) severely hampered extraction of Cu K-edge oscillations at higher k values. The RDF, for CuMnZrO2 catalysts calcined at both of 623 and 723K, were significantly different from that of CuO or Cu(OH)2 [29], suggesting formation of a copper species in a distinct local structure. On the other hand, the absence of CuCu bonding suggested that the Cu2+ species were highly dispersed on the zirconia surface. However, for CuMnZrO2 calcined over 873K, a weak peak due to CuCu bonding emerged at 2.8–2.9Å (uncorrected for phase shifts), indicating the formation of CuO clusters. It was noteworthy that the presence of iron clearly favored remaining the highly copper dispersion. The CuCu bonding only appeared on the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 1073K. Structural parameters, as derived from an EXAFS analysis, were summarized in Table 2 . In Cheah et al.'s research on the XAFS study of copper model compounds, they indicated that, due to the Jahn–Teller effect, the first coordination shell of Cu2+ was generally a distorted octahedron with four short bonds to equatorial ligands and two longer bonds to axial ligands [29]. However, the axial CuO bonds were difficult to characterize quantitatively by XAFS spectroscopy due to their very large Debye–Waller factors (Δσ 2 >0.02Å2). Their distances also could not be determined accurately. As a result, the four equatorial O atoms were only found to comprise the main EXAFS oscillations in the spectra [29]. Herein, the CuO coordination numbers for the catalysts, which showed Cu(OH)2 structure in an octahedral symmetry in XANES, were close or less than 4.0 as listed in Table 2. However, for the catalysts calcined at higher temperature, the CuO coordination numbers and distance was very close or equal to 4.0 and 1.95Å, indicating the formation of CuO cluster which had a densely structure. 3.3 Temperature-programmed reduction Fig. 7A presented the TPR profiles of CuMnZrO2 catalysts. Two peaks of H2 consumption were observed, corresponding to the reduction of highly dispersed copper species (at low temperature) and bulk CuO species (at high temperature), respectively [30]. Moreover, the area of the peak at low temperature monotonously decreased and synchronously shifted to higher temperature with the rise of calcination temperature. This illustrated that the copper species aggregated when the catalyst was calcined at high temperature. Apparently, the reduction behavior of CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 1073K was quite different from that observed on the others, suggesting that new phases formed. It might be due to the formation of spinel compounds, CuMn2O4, as revealed in XRD (see Fig. 2), which hindered the reduction of copper species as envisaged in TPR profiles. Compared with CuMnZrO2 catalyst, the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 623K exhibited a higher intensity for the low temperature peak than that at high temperature (see Fig. 7B). It was worthy noted that when the calcination temperature increased from 623 to 873K, the intensity of peak at 505K decreased and shifted to lower temperature, while the intensity of peak at 530K increased. The highly dispersed copper species were amorphous, which could be reduced easily due to their loose structure and the strong interaction between copper species and zirconia [31]. The reduction of highly dispersed copper species shifted to low temperature, suggesting that the copper crystallite sizes became smaller [30]. On the other hand, such a result indicated that with the rise of calcination temperature, the interaction between copper and iron decreased because this interaction could increase the temperature of copper species reduction [32]. Notably, no obviously peak of H2 consumption was found at higher temperature, suggesting that the iron was hardly reduced. It was possible that the interaction between iron and zirconia was too strong to reduce the hematite to Fe0. Castro and coworkers reported that the formation of Fe0 species could be hindered by the interaction of Fe2+ ions with the zirconia support [33]. However, metallic oxides particles shrank and crystallization when calcined at 1073K, suggesting that the metal-support interface was destroyed and the interaction between metallic oxide and support decreased. The metal species migrated to surface and formed new phases. Moreover, the formation of spinel compounds (CuMn2O4, CuFe2O4) hindered the reduction of copper species as envisaged in TPR profiles because of the strong interaction between them. 3.4 Catalytic activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation CuMnZrO2 catalyst showed the high activity and selectivity towards methanol synthesis. However, the activity decreased monotonously with the rise of calcination temperature as shown in Table 3 . The selectivity for alcohols showed a maximum when the catalyst calcined at 873K. The addition of iron suppressed the hydrogenation activity with the improvement of higher alcohols synthesis. The carbon chain growth was noticeably observed with the proportion of C2 + alcohols more than 18% when the catalyst calcined at 623K. Moreover, the selectivity for alcohols increased in line with the calcination temperatures increasing from 623 to 873K, while the proportion of C2 + alcohols in the total alcohol fraction decreased. On the CuMnZrO2 catalyst, with the rise of calcination temperature the copper species agglomerated and the dispersion decreased that led to decrease of catalytic activity. However, the TOF showed a maximum on the catalyst calcined at 873K, suggesting that the interaction between copper species and support reached the peak. This interaction was considered as the important factor for methanol synthesis by several researches [34,35]. Compared with CuMnZrO2, the addition of iron to the catalyst resulted in the suppression of overall catalytic activity, while it favored the higher alcohols synthesis. Courty et al. [10] investigated the Co modified Cu-Zn/Al2O3 catalyst, suggesting that suppression of the hydrogenation activity of Co would allow partially hydrogenated CH x species to remain for longer periods, and these were involved in the CC chain formation leading to the production of higher hydrocarbons and alcohols. On the basis of the XRD and XAFS results, iron enhanced the stability of the catalysts by stabilizing the amorphous phase of zirconia, and then the dispersion of copper species increased. However, the increase of copper dispersion did not improve the activity and the TOF reduced to minimum on the catalyst calcined at 873K. This indicated that the iron–zirconia interaction suppressed the interaction between copper species and zirconia. On the other hand, the interaction between iron and zirconia hindered the reduction of iron oxide, and then copper–iron interaction weakened, which reduced the active sites for higher alcohol formation. As a result, the catalytic activity for higher alcohols synthesis reduced. When the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst calcined at 1073K, it was found that the active phase greatly aggregated in XRD study. However, the overall activity increased consumingly. A large amount of hydrocarbons produced. At the same time, the proportion of higher alcohols in the liquid products was quite high. This might be explained by the enhanced interaction between copper and iron by formation of spinel compounds (CuFe2O4). It was reported that the copper–iron based catalyst had a high activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation, such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [32]. 4 Conclusion The effect of iron promoter on the structure and catalytic performance of CuMnZrO2 catalysts was investigated by comparison of iron-promoted and un-promoted catalysts calcined at different temperature. It was found that the change of metal-support interaction strongly influenced the surface and crystal structure of the catalyst and hence its catalytic performance. Low calcination temperature yielded poorly crystallized catalysts and favored the formation of a Cu(OH)2-like structure. For the CuMnZrO2 catalyst, with the rise of calcination temperature, surface area and dispersion of copper decreased, and the crystallization of zirconia occurred. Nevertheless, the copper–zirconia interaction increased in a way. The TOF showed a maximum on the catalyst calcined at 873K. The presence of iron could suppress agglomeration of copper species and crystallization of amorphous zirconia. The dispersion of copper was enhanced on the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst. However, the addition of iron to the catalyst resulted in the suppression of overall catalytic activity. On the one hand, the increase of iron–zirconia interaction with the rise of calcination temperature suppressed the interaction between copper species and zirconia. On the other hand, the interaction between iron and zirconia hindered the reduction of iron oxide, and then copper–iron interaction weakened, which reduced the active sites for higher alcohol formation.
