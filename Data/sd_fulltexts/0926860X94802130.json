Drago*, Krzysztof Jurczyk University of Florida, Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Lab. Building, Room 408, Gainesville, FL 32611-2046, USA (Received 26 August 1993, revised manuscript received 24 November 1993) Abstract The catalytic activity of some carbonaceous adsorbents in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl- benzene was investigated. By proper selection of conditions, the results of these studies indicate that comparable conversions and selectivities can be attained with these catalysts at significantly lower temperatures than those reported for metal oxide catalysts. The effects of oxygen concentration in the carder gas, contact time, and the addition of dopants and inhibitors to the reaction have been studied. Changes in these variables produce substantial changes in the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. One of the shortcomings of this reaction is coke formation. Studies with inhibitors suggest the cause of coke formation and methods for inhibiting it. Key words: Ambersorb ~'; carbon; dehydrogenation; ethylbenzene; oxidation; styrene 1. Introduction Styrene is produced industrially by catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene [ 1,2]. This is an endothermic reaction that is carried out at high temperatures (around 600 inlet and 550 exit) with moderate conversions (usually about 50%). In addition to the search for better catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, studies involving oxidative dehydrogenation are also being pursued [3-9]. The systems most often studied for the oxidative process are promoted inorganic oxide catalysts. These catalysts usually require temperatures of at least 500 where conversions of about 50% and selectivities of about 90% are obtained. The carbonaceous material formed on the inorganic oxide in the course of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene has been considered as the true catalytically active substance [ 6,9,10]. Consistent with this proposal, charcoal exhibits dehydrogenation *Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 1-904)392 6043, fax. ( + 1-904)392 4658. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

[7] and [8] and will not be repeated here. In this laboratory, we have been involved with the study of carbonaceous materials as supports for catalytic reactions. One of the interesting features of these materials is their ability to participate in the catalytic reactions and also function as a high-surface-area support. The combination of catalyst and support reactivity has led to synergism in the catalytic activity [ 13]. Earlier reports show that the carbonaceous supports have catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at significantly lower tempera- tures than those reported [ 14]. This finding prompted an investigation of some of the variables that can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity of carbonaceous catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Ambersorbs ~'~ \", Carbosieve G and GEO samples were supplied by the Rohm and Haas Company. AX-21 was purchased from Anderson Development Company. The Ambersorbs were modified by introducing KMnO 4 and NaOH using the pore filling technique. This involves adding solutions of the dopants to the carbon until the solid appears moist. Unless specified otherwise, the solution concentration is adjusted so that the amount of dopant added is 1 wt.-%. One sample (Ambersorb 572) was pore filled with 1 wt.-% of 2- mercaptobenzimidazole. After pore filling the samples were aged overnight and dried in a vacuum oven at 180 for 4 h. 2.2. Catalytic studies The oxidative dehydrogenation ofethylbenzene is carried out in a laboratory flow system. In a temperature-controlled glass reactor, 1.0 g of catalyst is supported on a fritted disc and covered with glass beads to facilitate complete vaporization of the substrate. Prior to the reaction, each sample was activated for 4 h in nitrogen at 360 using a flow-rate of 5 ml/ min. The reaction is initiated by switching to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen containing between 7.2 and 21 vol.-% O2 after the reaction temperature stabilizes. The gas flow-rate is varied from 5 to 15 ml/min. The temperature is monitored via a thermocouple in contact with the catalyst reaction bed. In some runs carbon tetrabromide, 1-butanethiol or ethanol were added to the ethylbenzene in the amount of 0.025-2 mol-%. Ethyl benzene is fed to the top of a reactor first contacting the glass beads on top of the catalyst. The ethylbenzene delivery rate was 0.2 ml/h except in one experiment where 0.5 ml/h was used. Products were condensed in a trap maintained at 0. Each reaction was carried out continuously for at least 50 h. Immediately after the reaction was stopped, the reactor was flushed with dry nitrogen during cooling to prevent oxidation of coke deposited on the catalyst. \"Ambersorb adsorbents are a registered trademark of Rohm and Haas Company.

The separation was made at 90 on a 2-m column packed with 15 wt.-% of DEGS on Chrom Waw 80-100 mesh. Gaseous products were also analyzed by gas chromatography using a thermoconductivity detector. This separation was made on a 2-m column packed with Carboxen TM 1000 with the temperature ramped from 42 to 175 at 15/min. 3. Results and discussion The results for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with various carbonaceous catalysts are compiled in Table 1. All the results given describe the catalyst's activity after at least 40 h of reaction. Studies of a limited number of systems at both 325 and 360 led to the selection of the higher reaction temperature for the more complete study because of the increased conversions. The catalysts studied are all based on carbon made by the pyrolysis of carbon containing materials. Both of the Ambersorb [ 5,22] adsorbent samples studied here are produced by pyrolysis of sulfonated poly (styrene-divinylbenzene) resins [ 15-17]. These precursors are designed to have high macropore and mesopore volume to facilitate transport of adsorbates in ion-exchange applications [ 18,19 ]. During the pyrolysis procedure, the polymer loses hydrogen and sulfur oxides becoming a carbon skeleton of the parent polymer. In the process, the macropore and mesopore characteristics of the macroreticular polymer are retained in the carbon form. The pyrolyzed materials have very Table 1 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene -- effect of support variation Reaction conditions: catalyst weight= 1.0 g; cartier gas (air) flow-rate=5 ml/min; ethylbenzene feed=0.2 ml/h Catalyst~ Conversion Selectivity (%) Coke (%) (g/g cat.)

AX-21, the carbon used in our earlier report, [ 13 ] is prepared by a process involving the high-temperature pyrolysis of polymeric petroleum coke in the presence of a large amount of KOH [20]. Washing the salt out of the carbon matrix after pyrolysis gives pores of molecular dimensions (5-6 ,~). The surface area of this material is very large (reported to be ca. 3000 m\"/g) and is attributed to high microporosity. The carbons selected for study differ in surface area, pore volume (see Table 2), pore size distributions and in surface functionality. Most of the carbons studied have high catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (Table 1) and most are more effective than the AX21 material reported earlier. At 360 the total conversion for the most active catalysts exceeds 65% with the selectivity to styrene above 70%. With samples having large micropore volumes (Amber- sorb 572, AX-21 ), adsorption of ethylbenzene by the carbon is observed at the start of the reaction. After approximately 2 h of reaction, surface area determinations show that much of the microporosity is lost. In spite of micropore plugging, the activity remains stable for a long period of time (50 h ). Consistent with this observation is the absence of a relationship between conversion and microporosity. Apparently, most of the reaction is occurring in the mesopores and macropores as well as on the external surface of the Ambersorbs. Though there is no direct relation between activity and meso- and macropore volumes for the most active catalysts, GEO 0316A with only 0.24 cm3/g of mesopores and macropores is least active in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at the feed rates employed. Variations in the activity of materials with greater than 0.5 cm3/g of meso- and macropores probably depend on surface functionality of the carbon. This property of the carbons is very difficult to probe. Paramagnetism precludes the use of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and complete adsorption of infrared radiation occurs in adsorption or reflectance spectros- copies. Photoacoustic spectroscopy provides no information about surface functionality. Two runs were carried out at different contact times (Table 3) with Ambersorb 572. Shorter contact times lead to decreased conversion but to a significant increase in selectivity. In order to assess the effect of other variables on the reaction, Ambersorb 563 and 572 were selected for study. The influence of the concentration of oxygen in the gas employed is shown in Table 4. As the oxygen concentration decreases, a decrease in the total conver- sion of ethylbenzene and an increase in selectivity to styrene results. In the case of Amber- sorb 563, 90% selectivity to styrene can be attained at 50% conversion.

These results parallel those obtained in the contact time variation studies and are probably caused by the same factor. Increasing contact time and percent oxygen to obtain more complete conversion led to increased production of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in many other experiments. The amount of coke produced is about the same in all the experiments in Table 4. With increased conversion, the fraction of ethylbenzene converted to coke decreases as the oxygen content in the carrier gas increases. More of the reaction product is carbon dioxide. In an attempt to co-catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation to styrene, the Ambersorbs were pore filled with a small amount of KMnO 4 and NaOH. This additive was chosen as one of a class of metal oxides with ability to catalyze the oxidation of hydrocarbons. At 360, the change in reactivity by adding KIVInO 4 and NaOH is not significant (Table 5). At the lower temperature (325), especially in the case of Ambersorb 563 sample, the effect of KMnO4/NaOH dopants is positive. Both the total conversion and the selectivity to styrene are increased. Sodium hydroxide by itself has a slight, deleterious effect leading to more carbon dioxide production. The deleterious effect of NaOH accounts for the poorer performance of the AX- 21 carbon reported earlier [13]. Basic conditions apparently destroy beneficial acidic functionality on the carbon. All of the catalysts studied have a tendency for coking, as observed by mass increase of the catalyst after reaction. In some instances, coking is so severe that the glass reactor tube Table 4 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene -- effect of oxygen variation Reaction conditions: T=360; catalyst weight= 1.0 g; carrier gas=mixture of (Q+N2); ethylbenzene feed = 0.2 ml/h Catalyst Carrier gas 02 content in Conversion Selectivity (%) Coke flow-rate carrier gas % EB (g/g cat.)

Porosimetry studies on the used catalyst show that the catalyst's micropores are filled in the process. The catalytic activity remains high during the entire reaction for many of the coked catalysts in spite of the decrease in surface area and loss of micropore pore volume. Coke is also reported [ 6,9,10] to form on metal oxide catalyst surfaces during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and this coke is active in the dehydrogenation reaction. One possible cause of coke formation is the polymerization of styrene and its subsequent thermal decomposition. In order to test this possibility and to prevent coke formation, experiments were carried out with inhibitors added to the feed of ethylbenzene. Carbon tetrabromide has the most positive effect as an inhibitor for coke formation. Some runs at Table 6 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene --effect of inhibitors Reaction conditions: catalyst weight = 1.0 g; carder gas (mixture of 02 + N2) flow-rate = 5 ml/min; ethylbenzene feed = 0.2 ml/h additives shown in parentheses Catalyst and inhibitor 02 content Conversion Selectivity (%) Coke in cartier % EB (g/g cat.) gas (%) Sty CO CO2 Temperature = 360 Amb 572 (2 mol-% CBr4) 7.2 44.4 92.7 2.1 4.1 0.00 Amb 572 + 2 wt.-% NaOH 7.2 58.3 94.1 1.6 3.5 0.00 ( 1 mol-% CBr4) Amb 572+ l wt.-% 7.2 39.3 88.1 3.4 8.1 0.54 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (0.025 mol- % 1 -butanethiol ) Amb 572 ( 1 mol% CBr4) 21 90.5 79.8 5.3 12.5 0.00 Amb 563 (2 mol% CBr4) a 10.7 52.5 90.1 3.1 5.1 0.00 Temperature = 325 Amb 563 + 2 wt.-% NaOH 7.2 53.8 93.0 2.0 3.8 0.00 (2 mol-% CBr4) Amb 563 ( 1 mol-% EtOH) 21 65.1 78.2 6.0 14.5 0.67 a Carder gas flow-rate = 9 ml/min; ethylbenzene feed = 0.5 ml/h.

Conversions of 90% can be obtained with a reduction in selectivity to 80%. A similar improvement with the use of CBr4 is also observed at 325. In all instances, when carbon tetrabromide is added as an inhibitor, no coking of the catalyst is observed during the reaction. Comparison of the results in Table 6 with those in Tables 1 and 4 shows that sulfur additives have little effect on reactivity and coke formation. Addition of ethanol leads to a slight increase in selectivity to styrene but does not inhibit coke formation. The use of halides as promoters of oxyde- hydrogenation is reported [21,22] to involve oxidation to the halogen, halogenation and oxidation of HX back to the halogen. This reaction sequence or a radical trapping mechanism could account for the inhibition of polymerization and eventual reduction in coke formation by CBr4. 4. Conclusions Various carbonaceous adsorbents have been shown to be active and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. In spite of blocking the micropores during the reaction, due to polymerization and subsequent decomposition of styrene, the activity of the catalysts remains high. Decreasing the amount of oxygen in the carrier gas or decreasing the contact time increases the selectivity to styrene and decreases the conversion. The effect of dopants causes minor improvement in conversion. Adding CBr4 to the ethyl- benzene feed prevents coking of the catalyst and has a very positive effect on selectivity. 5.

The effects of oxygen concentration in the carrier gas, contact time, and the addition of dopants and inhibitors to the reaction have been studied. Changes in these variables produce substantial changes in the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. One of the shortcomings of this reaction is coke formation. Studies with inhibitors suggest the cause of coke formation and methods for inhibiting it. Keywords AmbersorbXXX carbon dehydrogenation ethylbenzene oxidation styrene References [1] Lee E.H. Catal.
