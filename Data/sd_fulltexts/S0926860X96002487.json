A solvent extraction technique using two different solvents located the coke either on the external surface or within the pores of the zeolite and GC-MS analysis characterised the soluble coke. Coke was also examined using 13C MAS NMR and high resolution TEM. Substituted benzenes were identified as the major precursors to coke formation, and the external coke had a graphitic structure. The contact time was shown to affect only the rate of formation but not the composition of the coke. Keywords: ZSM-5; Deactivation; GC-MS; Graphite 1. Introduction The formation of carbonaceous residues (coke) on hydrocarbon processing catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance to the petrochemical industry. As a result, a great deal of work has been carded out to study the nature and formation of these residues. Various analytical techniques have been employed to examine the deposition of coke on zeolite catalysts. Several review articles have been published outlining experimental procedures [1-3].

Holmes et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 355-372 Sorption studies have been used to locate coke within the zeolitic pores [4,5], and also to differentiate between poisoning and blockage of the active sites [6,7]. Bulk techniques such as 13C MAS NMR and FTIR, have been used to investigate the general composition of the coke deposits and to display changes with temperature [8,9], giving rise to the terms 'high' and 'low temperature' coke. Both of these techniques were also used by Wojciechowski and co-workers [10,11] to study the mechanisms of coke formation over H-US-Y during the cracking of straight chain hydrocarbons. Other bulk methods, such as XRD [12], EPR [13,14], gravimetric analysis [15] and UV-Visible spectroscopy [7] have also been used to study coke deposits, but none are adequate to identify individual components in the coke mixture. However, a solvent extraction technique proposed by Magnoux et al. [16], involving the destruction of the zeolite framework with hydrofluoric acid, has been particularly successful in the study of individual components [ 1,17-21 ]. The aim of this study is to investigate the formation of coke on H-ZSM-5 during the cracking of hexadecane by examining the location of the soluble and insoluble coke using four solvent extractions coupled with the destruction of the framework with HF. The effect of time-on-stream, contact time and Si/A1 ratio on the composition and location of coke is examined. Quantification of the various classes of coke components, and trapped products, is achieved using an internal standard calibration, coupled with GC-MS analysis. TEM and ~3C MAS NMR are also used to study the composition of the 'insoluble' coke. 2. Experimental 2.1. The catalyst The sample of ZSM-5 used was obtained from Eka Nobel (id. no. 13-91-001 EZ-332). Atomic absorption analysis was used to determine the bulk Si/A1 ratio for the zeolite which was found to be 25. The zeolite was repeatedly ion-ex- changed using ammonium sulphate solution to remove sodium ions from the framework (Na wt.-% < 0.03). 2.2. The reaction Hexadecane of 99% purity (ex Aldrich) was used without further purification. The major impurities were found to be skeletal isomers of hexadecane. Reaction was carried out in a fixed bed flow reactor at 350 and 20 atmospheres pressure with pre-dried hydrogen as cartier gas. A ratio of 4/1 H 2/feed was maintained for all reactions. These conditions were chosen since further work involved a comparison with platinum loaded hydrocracking cata- lysts. The catalyst was activated at 450 under flowing hydrogen. The contact S.M.

The catalyst was pelleted to a mesh size of 40-60 (250-420 /zm). The dilution of the zeolite, and the subsequent contact times are shown in Table 1. For each dilution of the zeolite, the coke was examined at four different times-on-stream, after 1, 2, 4 and 6 h. After these times, the reaction was halted by turning off the feed, and the coked zeolite was left overnight at the reaction temperature, under flowing hydrogen, to remove any residual products or unreacted feed. After removal from the reactor, the weight percent of carbon and hydrogen on the sample was determined, using a Carlo Erba 1108 elemental analyser. 2.3. Examination of the products A sample of the liquid products was collected over the final 30 min of any given reaction, and the off-gas analysed 15 min before the end of the reaction. The liquid products were analysed using a PIANO (paraffins, iso-paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes and olefins) technique on a 100 m OV101 capillary column in a Hewlett Packard PU-5890 gas chromatograph. The gaseous prod- ucts were analysed on a 50-m PLOT A1203/KC1 capillary column using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph. 2.4. Coke analysis An initial extraction with CCl4, a bulky molecule too large to enter the pores, removed externally accessible coke. A second extraction of the zeolite with CH2CI2, which in principle can enter unblocked pores, removed material accessible within the pore system. Finally, the zeolite containing residual coke was treated with 40% HF to destroy the framework and release any trapped products. The products were extracted with CH2C12 to separate 'soluble' and 'insoluble' coke residues. The solvent extracts were concentrated, and an internal standard (acen- aphthene 99.9% pure) was added. Peak areas from GC-MS analysis for each coke component were then referenced against this internal standard, and the 358 S.M.

The analysis was made using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph, fitted with a 25-m BP21 fused silica capillary column, con- nected to a Delsi-Nermag (ATI Unicam) Automass 120 mass spectrometer. After the final CH2C12 extraction, residual insoluble coke was quantified simply by weighing the residue after filtration. Several samples of the initial coked zeolite were washed with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone which was found to dissolve all coke residues [22]. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone is too large to enter the pores of ZSM-5, and hence will only remove external coke. It was found that after treatment of the coked zeolite with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, no 'insoluble' coke could be found using the standard extraction technique with CC14, CHzCI2, and 40% HF. This showed the 'insoluble' coke to be formed solely on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. The 'insoluble' coke was further examined using a Philips EM400 transmission electron microscope fitted with an energy dispersive spectrometer for X-ray analysis (EDAX) system. The insoluble coke from the filter paper was examined and EDAX used to ensure the complete dissolution of the zeolite framework (shown by the absence of silicon or aluminium peaks). A comparison of a 6 h, and 1 h-on-stream experiment was carried out using ~3C MAS NMR, however, the low coke levels and the low natural abundance of ~3C meant that long acquisition times were required for this study, and hence only one such experiment was carried out. The NMR experiments were made using a Bruker 400 MSL spectrometer, the experimental conditions are shown in Table 2. 3. Results 3.1. Product analysis The change in conversion with contact time, Si/A1 ratio and time-on-stream is displayed in Table 1. Conversion showed little change over the range of times-on-stream studied here. This is consistent with previous work which has shown ZSM-5 to deactivate slowly relative to other zeolite catalysts. As a S.M. Holmes et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 355-372 359 consequence of the very slow deactivation, the product distributions were found to be reasonably constant over the reaction period studied. The product distribu- tions show little change in the alkane/alkene ratio with time-on-stream and show that the fall in the iso/normal alkane levels was not significant. 3.2. Coke analysis A pelletised sample of the pure LUDOX AS-40 was run for 6 h under reaction conditions and it was found, using the solvent extraction techniques, that no coke was deposited on the LUDOX, and only trace amounts of hexadecane were detected. Another sample of LUDOX was placed in the reactor under a bed of pure H-ZSM-5 and again, when the LUDOX was solvent extracted, there was no evidence of coke deposition on the LUDOX. We can, therefore, assume that neither the feed nor the cracking products generate coke on the LUDOX diluent, and that all coke was deposited either within the framework or on the external surface of the zeolite. For simplification of presentation the numerous soluble coke components which were found in the three extracts were grouped into compound types. Only four classes of compound were detected in the soluble coke: Alkanes Alkenes Substituted benzenes Substituted naphthalenes No coke molecules larger than substituted naphthalenes were detected in the soluble extracts. This is not caused by reduced solubility since similar work on larger pore zeolites [1,16] has shown much larger and more aromatic molecules to be soluble in methylene chloride. Since we have shown that all the coke is formed on the zeolites, and not on the support, all of the results are presented as mass of coke per gram of zeolite in the catalyst bed. 3.3. Coke composition and location The total amounts of each class of coke component are displayed in Figs. 1-4. In Fig. 1 the alkane levels (excluding unreacted feed) are displayed and show the fall in concentration of alkanes, found in the two external washes, with increasing time-on-stream. As contact time is increased the levels of alkanes in the three extracts fall, probably due to the increase in secondary reactions which generate products which either diffuse out of the framework during the reaction (i.e., smaller alkanes and alkenes), or generate unsaturated bulkier products such as coke precursors. The alkene levels are extremely low at all but the shortest contact times (Fig. 2), this would seem to indicate rapid secondary reaction of trapped alkenes to give smaller products which can rapidly diffuse out of the pores, or the 360 S.M.

Schematic of the change in concentration of soluble coke with time-on-stream and contact time. Relative to the substituted benzenes, the levels of naphthalenes shown in Fig. 4 were extremely low and, as expected of a bulkier molecule, very low levels were detected in the external washes throughout the study. The general trend is an increase in the naphthalenes concentration with time-on-stream, which im- plies that the naphthalenes are a product of the coking reaction which do not react further, to any great extent, to form larger coke molecules. In fact, the bulky nature of the substituted naphthalenes may lead to some pore blockage in the channel intersections of H-ZSM-5. The total soluble coke levels are displayed in Fig. 5. At the longest contact time, the levels of soluble coke are low and relatively constant whilst maxima at the shorter contact times are observed to move to longer times-on-stream with decreasing contact time. It would seem that in the case of the longest contact time, this maxima has already been passed by the time of the first test point. A schematic of the trends seen is shown in Fig. 6. The maxima in extractable coke levels are probably caused by the subsequent formation of 'insoluble' coke, this formation consumes the soluble coke generating the maxima. The formation of insoluble coke is much faster at longer contact time where secondary reactions predominate hence the shift in maxima. As previously stated substituted ben- zenes form the major component of the soluble coke and the total soluble coke levels detected follow the trends in the substituted benzenes, Since the other coke components do not follow similar trends, it would seem that substituted benzenes are the main precursors in the coking reaction. Fig. 7 displays the mass of carbon on the zeolite detected by elemental analysis and also the total mass of coke extracted from the zeolites, including the insoluble coke and the unreacted feed. By comparing the two levels, it is possible to establish the efficiency of the extraction technique and ensure that significant quantities of coke are not lost in the procedure.

The change in the insoluble coke composition with time-on-stream was studied using 13C MAS NMR. Two samples of the 10% zeolite catalyst were analysed and the spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The 10% zeolite was of interest since the extraction studies showed the most marked difference in coke composi- tion on this catalyst, although the lower abundance of coke on the low zeolite catalyst makes NMR studies more difficult. From Fig. 8 we can see that after 1 h, the only signals are in the aliphatic region with peaks at 13, 22 and 30-32 ppm which correspond to the terminal methyl, a-methylene and intemal CH2 groups respectively [9]. Since cross polarisation was not used, we can say that the average number of carbons per hydrocarbon molecule in the zeolite was 13. After 6 h, the spectra changed dramatically, in that no aliphatic peaks were detected, and a broad hump around 144 ppm was generated, this hump is indicative of numerous poly-aromatic species [22,23,10]. The change in spectra is similar to that shown by Karge and co-workers [8,9] with increasing tempera- ture. The present work shows that a similar change also occurs with time-on- stream at constant temperature. Elemental analysis provides the hydrogen/carbon ratio for the coke deposits on the zeolites thereby showing the overall degree of unsaturation of the coke. The H/C ratios for all three catalysts are shown in Fig. 9. The H/C ratio falls with time-on-stream, and at the longest contact time, an almost graphitic composition is achieved. The external insoluble coke was studied using transmission electron mi- croscopy, the complete dissolution of the zeolite framework was checked using the EDAX facility on the microscope, and from Fig. 10a it is evident that the coke forms a cocoon-like structure around the zeolite crystal. Further inspection (Fig. 10b,c) shows the cocoon to be made up of parallel filaments of the order of H/C Ratio 1.6 -- 1.4, ,~ 1.2' 1 0.8i 0.6i ~ 0.4.- 0.2 \" \" 0 ....... 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Time on Stream (hrs) 100% Zeolite ~ 30% Zeolite ~ 10% Zeolite Fig. 9.

These twisting sheets are characteristic of a graphitic structure. Electron diffraction patterns of these twisting sheets reveal d-spacings suffi- ciently close to assign the structure to that of graphite [24] (Table 6). 4. Discussion From the distribution of both the soluble coke and the products, it appears that coke formation involves two major steps. The initial cracking reaction generates alkenes, which then undergo secondary reactions, involving cyclisa- tion and dehydrogenation, to form small substituted aromatics, both benzenes and naphthalenes. These smaller aromatics then undergo further cyclisation and dehydrogenation to form larger insoluble polyaromatic compounds, and eventu- ally graphite. Mechanisms for the formation of small aromatics from straight chain hydrocarbons have been suggested previously [1,10]. For example the formation of toluene from hexadecane with subsequent formation of naphthalene might proceed as in Fig. 11. It seems that further increase in the size of the aromatic molecule does not occur within the H-ZSM-5 framework, since no compounds larger than substituted naphthalenes were detected in the HF extract. This selectivity must occur as a result of transition state constraints rather than diffusional limitation since, following destruction of the framework, product molecules bulkier than naphthalenes which were hindered by diffusional restric- tions would be detected. The continued increase in the substituted naphthalenes within the framework but not on the external surface shows that those naphthalenes formed within the framework from the substituted benzenes are too large to diffuse out of the framework and further cyclise and condense to give bulky coke molecules. The transition states required for further cyclisation of naphthalenes are too large to occur within the pores, and hence this reaction only occurs at the surface of the crystals. The substituted benzenes in the extracts display a maximum value which tails off as the insoluble coke levels rise. It would appear therefore that the formation of the larger coke molecules requires the rapid cyclisation and dehydration of the substituted benzenes. The substituted benzenes which diffuse to the surface of the crystal generate substituted naphthalenes which then rapidly cyclise to generate large polyaromatic coke species. It is clear that coking in H-ZSM-5 is not confined to outer surfaces, but involves both internal and external surfaces in agreement with previous work [25,26]. Previous work has shown that aromatics with up to six rings are soluble in methylene chloride [1,21]. The absence of these intermediate sized aromatics, coupled with the presence of insoluble coke only at the external surface of the zeolite, again indicates that the formation of the insoluble coke from the benzenes occurs either at the surface or in the pore openings of ZSM-5. If the S.M. Holmes et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 355-372 371 VVVV A/V I$OM CRACKING > > +R+ ~ +R+ + + ~ + + +R + % -RH -:4 > > \" ;, +R+ ~ -KH .:4 < Fig. 11. Possible mechanism for the formation of naphthalene from hexadecane. intermediate sized aromatics are formed at the surface they will either react further to generate larger insoluble aromatics or they will be removed in the purge of the catalyst after the reaction has been halted. This does not mean that the deactivation of ZSM-5 is caused solely by external surface coverage of the zeolite crystals since large substituted benzenes and naphthalenes which cannot diffuse out of the framework will block or partially block intersections and thereby deactivate the catalyst [5,18,27]. It would seem that the very low rate of deactivation, as evidenced by the slow fall in conversion, is a result of the relatively small pores in ZSM-5 which restrict formation of the bulkier 'deactivating' molecules which are found in the larger pore zeolites. Although a graphitic cocoon is formed around the surface of the zeolite it would seem that 372 S.M. Holmes et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 355-372 this cocoon does not affect (at least at the levels considered here) to any great extent the diffusion of the feed in or the products out of the zeolite crystals.

The location and composition of the coke formed over H-ZSM-5 zeolites during the cracking of hexadecane at 350°C and at 20 atmospheres was studied. A solvent extraction technique using two different solvents located the coke either on the external surface or within the pores of the zeolite and GC-MS analysis characterised the soluble coke. Coke was also examined using 13C MAS NMR and high resolution TEM. Substituted benzenes were identified as the major precursors to coke formation, and the external coke had a graphitic structure. The contact time was shown to affect only the rate of formation but not the composition of the coke. Keywords ZSM-5 Deactivation GC-MS Graphite References [1] M. Guisnet P. Magnoux Appl.
