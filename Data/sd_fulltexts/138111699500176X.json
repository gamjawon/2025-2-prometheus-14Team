Brescia, Dept. lngegneria Meccanica, Via Valotti, 25060 Brescia, Italy Abstract In high pressure gas phase conditions, methanol and syngas mixtures can be converted to acetic and higher carboxylic (C3-C5) acids on supported rhodium catalysts in presence of methyl iodide. Chemical trapping and FTIR spectroscopic studies show that two mechanisms are involved in the carboxylic acid formation. One is the conventional carbon monoxide insertion model on the rhodium part of the catalyst. The second proceeds through the isomerization of methyl formate on the support. On the support alone the chain growth stop~ at the C2-intermediate since no rhodium is present to convert acetic acid or methyl acetate to ethanol or ethoxy species. Keywords: Methanol; Carbonylation; Acetic acid; Carboxylic acids; Rhodium catalysts; Mechanism 1. Introduction Carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid is a well known industrial process. It is performed in homogeneous systems mainly by the so-called Monsanto process in presence of rhodium based catalysts at moderate temperature and pressure ( 150-200, 30-60 bar) [ 1 ]. Acetic acid can also be produced directly from CO + H2 on Ru [2], Co [2] or Rh [3] containing catalysts. It has also been shown that C,H2n + 1OH alcohols can be con- verted into CnH2, ~COOH carboxylic acids [4]. Further acetic acid can be produced by catalytic isomerization of methyl formate with Rh, Ir, Ru, Co [ 5 ] and Ni [ 6 ] catalysts. Higher monocarbox- ylic acids can be prepared by reacting C1_9 alkyl * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ct to C3 aliphatic car- boxylic acids are produced in presence of hafnium compounds from CO + H2 [8]. Recently it has also been claimed that the reaction of methanol with a CO + H2 mixture in presence of methyl iodide and heterogeneous supported catalysts can lead to a series of straight chain higher carboxylic acids [ 9,10]. The present work will be devoted to the formation of acetic acid and higher carboxylic acids on supported rhodium catalysts. Infrared spectroscopy and chemical trapping have been used to study the individual steps of carboxylic acid formation from methanol and CO + H2. 368 L.

Catalyst preparation The rare earth oxides (CeO2, Pr6Oll, LaaO3) were prepared from their nitrate (Ln(NO3)3\"6HaO; Ln=rare earth). 10 g Ln(NO3)3.6HzO were dissolved in 400 ml dis- tilled water, heated under stirring at 80. The pH was adjusted to 7 with ammonia. The precipitate was filtered, washed, dried at 120 and calcined in air at 400 for 10 h. ZrOz was prepared by hydrolysis of Zr(C3H70)4 (Fluka). The pH was adjusted to 7 by ammonia, and the precipitate was treated like that of rare earths. SiOz has been pur- chased from Degussa (Sipernat 22). The La2Zr207 pyrochlore has been prepared as fol- lows. The precursors (La(NO3)3.6H20 and Zr(C3H70)4) are dissolved in alcohol, precipi- tated by oxalic acid, filtered and calcined at 700. The BET specific surface area of the oxides were about 35 mz g- 1. The catalysts were prepared by a conventional impregnation of the support by the suitable amount of an aqueous solution of RhC13.xHzO from Johnson Matthey to obtain 3 wt%Rh/sup- port. The catalysts were dried at 120 and cal- cined in air at 450 for 10 h. 2.2. Activity measurements The catalytic tests have been performed in a stainless steel (Z2CND17-12) reactor of 8 mm inner diameter which has been lined by a copper tube of 6 mm inner diameter. The length of the heated part was 0.43 m and the catalyst was main- tained in the middle part of the reactor by glass wool plugs. The CO-Ha mixture has been pre- pared in the laboratory and controlled by GC with a TCD detector. The synthesis gas was then com- pressed to 50 MPa in a 500 ml high pressure ves- sel. The pressure in the device (21 MPa) is regulated by a Tescom 70 MPA, the gas flow is measured by a Setaram 3100 flowmeter and reg- ulated by an electronic controller coupled with a Brooks 5835N electrovalve. At the exit of the reactor the liquids are trapped at 10 under high pressure. The pressure of the exit gas is reduced to 2 MPa and analyzed by GC with both TCD and FID detectors. The CH3OH---CH3I mixture is cooled to 0 to avoid evaporation and introduced into the device by a model 303 Gilson metering pump. Previous to the catalytic test, the catalyst (0.5 g) is reduced by hydrogen at 230 during 15 h. The hydrogen is then released and the syn- thesis gas is progressively introduced. The sam- pies are collected after 24 h in order to achieve the steady state. 2.3. FTIR spectroscopy 10 to 20 mg of catalyst were pelleted as a disk 12 mm in diameter. The spectra were taken in a vacuum device similar to that used by Lamotte [ 11 ]. The spectra were recorded on a Nicolet MX1 FTIR spectrometer after 100 scans with a 4 cm- 1 resolution. The catalysts are reduced in situ at 400 by hydrogen which has been admitted into the cell. The hydrogen atmosphere was then pumped off and the procedure was repeated 5 times. Metal particle size as measured by carbon monoxide adsorption by pulse techniques were estimated to be 2.5 nm for Rh/CeO2 and 1.9 nm for Rh/Pr6Oll. 3 to 5 kPa of products were intro- duced into the vacuum device and the first spec- trum was taken after 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was then lifted into the heating part for 10 min. The pellet was reintroduced into the beam at room temperature, the pressure being main- tained constant during the measurement. The reported spectra are obtained after subtraction of the catalytic pellet and the gas phase spectra. 2.4. Chemical trapping experiments The device used for the chemical trapping has been reported elsewhere [ 12]. The species were trapped at 120 by an excess of CH3I or CD3I. L.

Activity measurements Catalyst Remaining Selectivity % reagent % Acids The results obtained in continuous flow exper- iments at the steady state are given in Table 1. It can be seen that almost all tested catalysts give a chain growth in our reaction conditions. Rh/La203 has the best productivity, however rho- dium is rapidly lost from the catalytic surface and lanthanum is dissolved as lanthanum acetate. The selectivity for methyl acetate is much higher on the Rh/CeO2 catalyst which gives no further chain growth. In order to control if acetic acid is an intermediate in the C3 acid formation, acetic acid was introduced with a CO + H2 flow into the reac- tor. The obtained results are given in Table 2. It can be seen that acetic acid takes part in the chain growth but that its reduction to ethanol or ethoxy species is rate determining since in the same conditions ethanol is almost completely con- verted to propionic acid with a good selectivity. Thus from these experiments it can be proposed that the reaction sequence is the following: CH3OH CH31 H2 CO + CO ~ CH3COOH ~ CzHsOH \"--) C2HsCOOH CH3I CH3OH AcMe AcEt C2 C3 C4 C5 5%Rh/ 88.7a 26.3 7.4 4.1 - 60.1 2.1 - La203 5%Rh/ 13.1b - 4.7 7.1 11.8 63.3 4.5 0.2 La203 a Acetic acid. b Ethanol. Operating conditions see Table 1. 3.2. Carbon monoxide adsorption The attribution of bands in the FTIR spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed on 3%Rh/Pr6Ol~ is given in Table 3. A band at 2066 cm-t can be attributed to a linearly adsorbed species. Two small ones at 1908 and 1882 correspond to carbon monoxide chemisorbed in a bridging configura- tion. According to the literature the band at 1908 cm- t has been ascribed to CO bridge bonded to two rhodium atoms on the rhodium (100) face [ 13]. It shifts to 1944 cm- t for higher coverages. The band at 1882 cm- ~ arises from CO adsorption on the more dense ( 111 ) face. Similar observa- tions have been made for rhodium supported on CeO2 [ 14,15]. It seems that this could point to a dependence of the activity from the morphology of the rhodium particle [ 16]. Further a low fre- quency band appears at 1720 cm- 1.

This low frequency feature has been attrib- uted to a carbon monoxide species which is coor- dinated to the surface both through carbon and Table 4 oxygen [14,17-20]. At room temperature twin bands are observed at 2096 and 2029 cm-~ and can be attributed to the symmetric and antisym- metric vibrations of gem carbonyl species on iso- lated Rh1sites [17-20] resulting from the rupture of Rh-Rh bonds in small particles [ 19,21- 23]. In order to confirm the attribution of the bands, I3CO and Ctso have been adsorbed on 3%Rh/Pr60~ (Table 3) and the results are com- pared to that of Ichikawa et al. [24] on Rh-Mn/ SiO2. Very similar results are thus obtained on Rh/ Pr6Oll and Rh-Mn/SiO2, except that for ct80 adsorption, the expected shift in the C and O bonded species ( ~ 60 cm- 1) is present, whereas Ichikawa et al. [24] observed that the position of this low frequency band is very near to that observed for C160 suggesting that on Rh-Mn/ SiO2 a facile 180 to 160 exchange occurs. By heat- ing, the linear and bridge bonded species are more rapidly desorbed than the C and O bonded species. FTIR spectra of adsorbed methanol and attribution of bands (25).

Methanol and formaldehyde adsorption The FTIR spectra of adsorbed methanol and formaldehyde have been interpreted and pub- lished elsewhere for Rh/SiO2 and Rh/CeO2 [ 25 ]. The results are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively, and compared to that obtained on Rh/Pr6Ojl in the present work. The most striking result is the formation of formyl species on the CeO2 and Pr6Oll supported rho- dium catalysts. It seems that one of the roles of the support is to stabilize these formyl species when compared to a silica supported catalyst. 3.4. Adsorption of formic acid FTIR spectra of formic acid on Pr6011 are given on Fig. 1. A band at 2940 cm- ~ could correspond to physisorbed formic acid [26]. Bands at 2855 and 1696 cm ~ are similar to that observed by Millar et al. [26] on supported copper catalysts. Table 5 FTIR spectra of adsorbed formaldehyde and attribution of bands. These authors attribute these features to vCH and vC=O of formic acid coordinated by oxygen to a Lewis acid site H OH ( \\C\" u ) 0 4, The band at 1696 cm- i disappears upon heat- ing. Two bands at 1565 and 1536 cm- 1 could be attributed to the va(OCO) vibrations of bidentate formates adsorbed on two different sites. They correspond to vs(OCO) features at 1335 ~md 1373 cm-~ and to a 6(OCO) vibration at 773 cm - I. These bands can be ascribed by comparison with the results of Li et al. on CeO2 [ 27 ]. Two types of monodentate formates have also been evidenced with va(OCO) at 1604 and 1590 cm- l and vs(OCO) at 1270 cm-1. Bands observed at 1066, 1175, 1467 and 1476 cm-' are similar to that obtained by CH20 adsorption on TiO2 and ZrO2 and attributed to vC-O, /9CH2, wCH2 and 6CH2 of a dioxymethylene species [28].

At 120 these bands disappear again. Comparing to the results obtained by Saussey et al. [29] upon adsorption of CO+H2 on ZnO (6CH: 1371, ~,C- O: 1521 and vCH: 2664 and 2769 cm-l), these features could be attributed to the formation of a formyl species. The FTIR spectra of formic acid on Rh/Pr6OI1 show only few differences with that of the adsorp- tion on the support. However it seems that only one of the bidentate formate species is present ( va(OCO): 1553, vs(OCO): 1375 and 6(OCO): 765 cm- 1). At 789 cm- 1, there is a feature which does not appear on the support alone. Lamotte [ 11 ] has evidenced a band in the same area on Cu/ZnO and suggested that it might be ascribed to the for- mation of a formic anhydride adsorbed on the surface. The band at 1507 cm-~ on the support alone is shifted to 1529 cm-~ and can also be attributed to a formyl species. The presence of different formate species on the support can be explained by the fact that Pr6Ol 1 is partially reduced to Pr203 and that the charge of Pr is somewhere between 3 (Pr203) and 3.66(Pr6Oll) and therefore several different adsorption sites may be present. In presence of rhodium, more activated hydrogen can be pro- vided to the support and only one adsorption site remains. The results obtained for the adsorption on the catalyst suggest that the reactions outlined in Scheme 1 might be operative. H \"C=O l M-O-M species have previously been proposed by Hattori and Wang to be present on the surface of MgO [30] after interaction with CO + H2. 3.5.

At room temperature a band at 1698 cm which disappears upon heating is similar to that obtained by adsorption of formic acid and can therefore be attributed to a species adsorbed on the surface through its oxygen as follows: CH3 OH \\C/ ii O :k The same bands are observed on Rh/Pr60~ ] but two features appear in the area of ua(OCO) ( 1568 and 1558 cm ~) and of vs(OCO) (1453 and 1427 cm-]). This corresponds to two types of acetates located one on the support and the second possibly on rhodium. The combination band between 6(OCO) and p(OCO) is shifted to a lower frequency (1253 instead of 1277 cm-~). Like on Pr60]~, a band appears at 1703 cm ] and could correspond to an O adsorbed acetic acid. Indeed it disappears readily upon heating. 3.6. Acetaldehyde adsorption Acetaldehyde adsorption on unpromoted and promoted (CeO2, ZrO2) Rh/SiO2 has been stud- ies and published by Demri et al. [33 ]. The most striking point is the stabilization of an acetyl spe- cies on the surface of the promoted catalysts. On Rh/Pr60]], at room temperature a band at 1694 cm ] is characteristic of the vC=O vibration of physisorbed acetaldehyde [34]. A series of fea- tures can also be associated with this physisorbed species (vCH: 2866, combination bands: 2824, 2767, 6aCH3: 1440, pCH: 1407 and 1384, 8sCH3: 1342, uaC-C: 1127 and 1098 cm-~). By heating the sample to 120 a new band appears at 1665 cm-~. This band disappears by further heating. A series of other bands appears and disappears in same time as the previous one and correspond well to the features observed by Hieber et al. [ 35 ] for an acetyl linked to a neutral rhenium carbonyl complex (vCH3: 2903, vaC- C: 1094, pCH3:957 and 910 cm- ~ ). The similar- ity of the results presented here with those found by Demri et al. [33] leads us to attribute this species to a stabilized acetyl species. Further, ace- tate species are also observed during the heating of the sample: ( vaCH3: 3016, 2987, usCH3: 2940, vaO-C-O: 1555, pCH3:1052 and 1009 cm-]). 374 L.

Surface coupling reactions In order to elucidate the mechanism of chain growth on Rh/Pr6Oll, two reactions have been studied: CH3I + CO and CHaOH + CO. 3.8. CH3I + CO (Fig. 3) Addition of CH3I on Rh/Pr60~~ results imme- diately in a peak at 1248 cm- 1 which is charac- teristic of a chemisorbed CH3 species. Upon addition of CO the bands of chemisorbed carbon monoxide appear at 2059 cm-~ (linear), 2092 and 2036 cm-1 (gem-dicarbonyl) and 1895 and 1851 cm-~ (bridged). By heating to 90, fea- tures corresponding to an acetate species develop in the spectrum ( vaCH3:3034 and 2979, usCH3: 2931; ua(OCO): 1555; ~(OCO): 1421; t~CH3: 1345; RCH3: 1068, 1016 and 8a(OCO): 943 cm- ~ ). At the same time a band increases at 1655 cm-~ together with features at 2955, 2898, 1412, 1093 and 943 cm-~). If compared to the spectra of the acetyl observed by Hieber et al.

Adsorbed acetaldehyde can also be observed (vC=O: 1690, 6sCH3: 1346, vCH: 2781 cm-l and a combination band at 2823 cm-]). Acetal- dehyde can indeed be formed by reaction of the acetyl species with adsorbed hydrogen from the catalyst' s reduction.

FTIR spec~a of methyl formate adsorbed on PrrO~, ( 20 mbar ): ( a ) 60, (b) 180. 700.00 bution of bands to mono and bidentate methoxy species on Pr6Oll has been made according to the results obtained by Binet et al. [36] and Li et al. [ 27 ] on CeO2. Solymosi et al. [ 37 ] have observed the formation of methoxy species by adsorption of CH3OH on clean Rh( 111 ). They observed that this species is decomposed to CO + H2 at 200-220 K. It seems therefore that the support stabilizes the methoxy species formed on the rhodium particle. When the temperature is increased from room temperature to 120 new features appear. The band at 1715 cm- 1 can be attributed to a C and O coordinated carbon monoxide. The other bands can be ascribed to two bidentate formate (va(OCO): 1578, vs(OCO) (I): 1371, vs(OCO) (II): 1346; 3(OCO): 765), to an oxy- methylene species (rCHz: 1478 and vCO 1154 cm- 1) and to a formyl entity ( vC=O: 1501; ~CH: 1401 cm-]) located on the support. In the meth- anol adsorption, the band of linear CO is observed at 2012 cm- 1 and in presence of CH3OH + CO at 2050 cm-] compared to 2066 cm-1 with pure CO. The differences can probably be attribute to a decrease in dipole-dipole interactions caused either by a lower CO coverage or by dilution of CO by carbonaceous residues (CH3, CH30) from methanol decomposition. On the support alone, the bands corresponding to mono and bidentate methoxy species are also present, together with features corresponding to formates. The oxymethylene features are not observed. No acetyl species are observed on the support alone or on Rh/Pr60]]. On the support alone unlike on Rh/Pr6011, slight amounts of ace- tate are formed ( va(C-C): 96 cm- 1, ~a(CH3): 1445 cm- 1, vs(CH3) : 2926 cm- 1 and va(CH3): 2978, 3015 cm- 1). This is in agreement with the results of Ichikawa and Fukushima [ 38 ] who have shown that only a minor part of ethanol or acet- aldehyde formed in CO + Hz reactions incorpo- rated ]3C by addition of ]3CH3OH into the inlet gas flow. 3.10. Adsorption of methyl formate (Fig. 5) In the reactivity experiments it has been found that in the reaction CH3I + CH3OH + CO + Hz, L. Chateau et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 11996) 367-378 377 acetic acid or methyl acetate could be produced on the support alone with no further chain growth. It is also known from the literature that acetic acid can be produced by isomerization of methyl for- mate [5-7]. Methyl formate has therefore been adsorbed on Pr6Oi 1 to see if acetic acid or acetate species can be formed. At room temperature, methoxy species ( uaCH3:2931, Fermi resonance 2g~CH3 + usCH3: 2872, usCH; 2795, 6CH3: 1469; vC-O: 1060 cm ~) as well as monodentate formate (va(OCO): 1608; vs(OCO)\" 1267) and two types of bidentate formates ( ua(OCO)\" shoulder 1555; vs(OCO): 1379 (I), us(OCO)' 1336 and 6(OCO): 770 cm L) and dioxymethylene spe- cies 16CH2:1469 and uC-O: 1175 cm - ~ ) are formed. By heating the features ascribed to methoxy and dioxymethylene species diminish, the formates are strongly increased. Bands which can be ascribed to acetate entities appear (uaCH3: 3006; esCH3: 2961; us(OCO) 1428, combination between 6(OCO) and p(OCO)\" 1254 and uaC-C together with the intense ua(OCO) band at 1565 cm 1). Recently in homogeneous catalysis, the possi- bility of the formation and migration of methyl carbenium ion by the action of Lewis acid on methyl formate was suggested for the catalytic system [PPh3Pt(OAc)2]~ BF3139]. H Me ~C - O\" O Sn ~,, has been proposed by Onishi et al., [40] for the activation mode of methyl formate with a Run- Snn cluster system. It is suggested that such a multicenter interaction may facilitate the overall rearrangement of the CH3 group (from O to C) to realize the isomerization of methyl formate to ace- tic acid. From our FTIR result a mechanism sim- ilar to that proposed in refs. [3911 and [40] may operate on ProOf1 which is partially reduced and contains Pr4 + and Pr3 + ions which can play the role of Run and Snn respectively. 4. Conclusion It is well known that the main problem in the methanol carboxylation is the rupture of the C-O bond of CH3OH or of CH30 species. The results obtained in the present work show that acetate or acetic acid are not formed directly from methanol and CO on the rhodium containing catalysts. The CH3 species obtained by the reaction of CH3I with the rhodium gives an acetyl entity which is the chain growth intermediate in acetic acid formation in agreement with the results in homogeneous catalysis [41]. However acetic acid has been shown to be formed on Pr6Oll alone. In this case another mechanism must be operative. From our results in FTIR spectroscopy, it can be seen that no chain growth occurs from CH3I + CO and that only slight amounts of acetate are formed from CH3OH + CO. It is therefore proposed that acetic acid is formed by isomerization of methyl formate. 5. Unlinked References [171 References [ 1 ] R. Schultz, (Monsanto Co. ), US Pat. 3 717 670 ( 1973 ). [ 21 J.F.

In high pressure gas phase conditions, methanol and syngas mixtures can be converted to acetic and higher carboxylic (C3C5) acids on supported rhodium catalysts in presence of methyl iodide. Chemical trapping and FTIR spectroscopic studies show that two mechanisms are involved in the carboxylic acid formation. One is the conventional carbon monoxide insertion model on the rhodium part of the catalyst. The second proceeds through the isomerization of methyl formate on the support. On the support alone the chain growth stops at the C2-intermediate since no rhodium is present to convert acetic acid or methyl acetate to ethanol or ethoxy species.
