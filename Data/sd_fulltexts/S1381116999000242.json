Fax: +7-383-2-343-056; E-mail: potapov@catalysis.nsk.su 27 Al NMR MAS method has been used to study the surface aluminium compounds forming during the treatment of supported TiCl4/MgCl2 catalyst with organoaluminium compounds (OAC) of various composition (AlEt3, AlOct3, AlEt2Cl). Dialkylaluminium chloride has been found to be the main surface compound in the case of trialkylaliminium. Three surface species of dialkylaluminium chloride have been identified: one of them corresponds to 5-coordinated aluminium; the other two correspond to 6-coordinated aluminium with different alkyl-to-chlorine ratio. The relative amounts of surface species depend on the conditions of OAC reaction with catalysts and OAC composition. After polymerization of ethylene or propylene on trioctylaluminium-treated catalysts (polymer yield ca. 1 g/1 g catalyst), the signals of 5-coordinated aluminium disappear from the 27 Al NMR spectra of the catalysts. Keywords 27 Al NMR MAS Supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts Olefin polymerization 1 Introduction Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl4, adsorbed on the surface of highly dispersed MgCl2 is an active component of supported titanium–magnesium catalysts for olefin polymerization. Active sites of these catalysts are formed at the reaction of the TiCl4/MgCl2 with co-catalyst, usually AlEt3 and Al(i-Bu)3. The co-catalyst reduces supported TiCl4 into TiCl3 with its subsequent alkylation, with the aluminium containing compounds adsorbing tightly on the catalyst surface [1, 2]. The composition of organoaluminium co-catalyst affects essentially a performance of the catalyst kinetic and stereospecificity of the propylene polymerization [3–5]. For example, supported titanium–magnesium catalysts with dialkylaluminium chloride as co-catalyst demonstrate no polymerization activity [3, 5]. Several possible structures of the active component and active centers of supported titanium–magnesium catalysts are suggested in the literature [1, 6–9]. However, reliable experimental data in favor of any one of these structures are still lacked. In particular, the role of aluminium compounds formed on the catalyst surface after the catalyst reaction with organoaluminium co-catalyst has yet to be determined. Previously, with the use of 27 Al NMR MAS spectroscopy, we have identified the surface complexes of various OAC adsorbed on highly dispersed magnesium chloride [10]. In the present work, we have used 27 Al NMR MAS to study surface species formed in the reaction of OAC with supported TiCl4/MgCl2 catalyst. 2 Experimental Titanium–magnesium catalyst (TMC, 0.6 wt.% Ti) was obtained by supporting TiCl4 on highly dispersed MgCl2 (S BET∼76 m2/g) in heptane at room temperature and washing with hexane. Highly dispersed MgCl2 support was obtained via the reaction of Mg powder with butyl chloride (molar ratio BuCl/Mg=3) in hexane at 68°C [11]. Heptane solutions of AlEt3, AlEt2Cl and AlOct3 (trioctylaluminium) were used to treat the obtained catalyst. The procedure was as follows. Weighted portions of catalyst and solvent (heptane) were loaded into a glass reactor under Ar atmosphere, then OAC solution with a concentration of 50–60 mmol/l was added at a molar ratio of Al/Ti≈30–40 under stirring, the mixture was kept at ambient temperature for 60 min. In a separate experiment this treatment continued for 3 min (Table 1 , sample 1), then the obtained samples were washed with solvent and dried in vacuum. In order to obtain samples of the catalysts with a polymer—after treatment of catalyst with OAC—the reactor at ambient temperature was fed with olefin (ethylene or propylene) amounting to ca. 1.5–2 g olefin/g catalyst (ca. 400 g/g Ti) and kept for 5 min. The samples were then washed with solvent and dried under vacuum. Polymer content in samples were calculated from the decrease in Ti content. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (magnetic field 9.4 T, 27 Al resonance frequency 104.5 MHz) in a frequency range of 100 kHz. The number of accumulation was ca. 25 000 with a pulse width of 2 μs (π/12) and 0.2 s delay between pulses. Magic angle spinning in Andrew–Beams PMMA rotors (rotation frequency of 3–4 kHz) was applied. Chemical shifts were measured in ppm and referenced to the external 1 M aqueous solution of AlCl3. The accuracy of the chemical shift measurements depends on signal/noise ratio and usually attains 10% of the line width (i.e., 1–10 ppm). To avoid contact of the samples with air, their weighted portions (0.1–0.2 g) were loaded into the NMR rotor under Ar atmosphere and insulated with a paraffin bed under the rotor cap. Thus prepared samples can be stored in air over a day without changes of their spectra. 3 Results and discussion Table 1 shows the data on Ti and Al content in the studied catalysts as determined by the chemical analysis. It should be noted that the treatment of the catalyst with OAC results in decrease of Ti content. For example, samples 2, 7 and 10 contain 0.40, 0.48 and 0.40 wt.% of Ti, respectively, vs. 0.60 wt.% of Ti in the initial catalyst. Similar result has been obtained previously in Ref. [12]for TiCl4/MgCl2 catalyst treated with AlEt3 or AlEt2Cl at ambient temperature and molar ratio Al/Ti=1–2. Catalysts treated with different OAC contain close amounts of aluminium (0.36–0.42 wt.% of Al in samples 2, 7 and 10 in Table 1). As we demonstrated earlier [10], OAC of various composition (AlEt3, AlEt2Cl and AlEtCl2) tightly adsorb on the surface of initial MgCl2 support. It is important that different OAC adsorb on MgCl2 surface in close amount; so it is proposed that adsorbed OAC form surface complexes with the same Lewis acid sites of the magnesium chloride [10]. The support used in the present study can adsorb OAC in an amount of ca. 0.174 mmol/g (see sample 5, Table 1). According to Ref. [10], it is possible to suggest that TiCl4 and OAC adsorb on the same centres of MgCl2 surface. Therefore, in catalyst with 0.083 mmol Ti/g (sample 2, Table 1), free MgCl2 surface centres are still available for OAC adsorption. The number of these centres can be estimated as a difference 0.174–0.083 mmol/g=0.091 mmol/g. Sample 2 (TMC treated with AlEt3) contains 0.156 mmol Al/g. If this aluminium compound will adsorb preferentially on MgCl2 surface (as a limit case), then it will be distributed as 0.091 mmol/g on MgCl2 surface and 0.065 mmol/g on titanium centres. Draftly, in this sample OAC can bind with ca. 80% of titanium ions; and in sample 10 with more than 60% of titanium ions. The important conclusions of these estimations are: (i) OAC-treated catalysts contain two types of surface organoaluminium species: bonded with Ti-centres and bonded with free MgCl2 surface; (ii) the main part of titanium ions are bonded with organoaluminium compounds. Following are the results of 27 Al NMR MAS experiments. Fig. 1 a shows the spectrum of the AlEt3/TMC sample obtained after 3 min contact time of AlEt3 with TMC. This spectrum may be considered as a superposition of three lines (possible decomposition inserted): the more intensive line at ca. 10 ppm and two less intensive lines at 35 and 70 ppm. It is important to note that no spectra were detected for AlEt3/MgCl2 sample in Ref. [10], which seems to be due to a strongly disordered structure of surface AlEt3 species. In contrast, the spectrum of the AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 sample (Fig. 1c and data of Ref. [10]) contains three lines, with positions close to those for the spectrum of AlEt3/TMC sample, with somewhat different relative intensities. The similarity of the spectra seems to originate from the similarity of surface species for AlEt3/TMC and AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 samples. This is no surprise since AlEt3 reacts with TMC producing AlEt2Cl. The second AlEt2Cl molecule can be formed at the alkylation of TiCl3 with AlEt3. Hence the species formed at the reaction of AlEt3 with TMC have AlEt2Cl composition and are strongly bonded with the catalyst surface. The structure of these species is close to that of AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 samples, that follows from the above-mentioned similarity of their NMR spectra. The attribution of the lines in these spectra was performed in Ref. [10]as follows. The line at 70–80 ppm was attributed to 5-coordinated Al with two ethyl groups. The line at 35 ppm could arise from the 6-coordinated Al with three ethyl groups in the (AlEt2Cl) n chains forming on the MgCl2 surface. The line at 10 ppm most likely corresponds to the 6-coordinated Al with 4 chlorine atoms and 2 ethyl groups in the first coordination sphere. Note, the AlEt3/TMC and AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 spectra differ by a relative intensity of lines: the line at ∼70 ppm is more intensive in the spectrum of AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1b shows 27 Al NMR spectrum of AlEt3/TMC (sample 2) obtained via the interaction of AlEt3 with TMC during 1 h. Compared with sample 1 (Fig. 1a), longer reaction time resulted in the decrease of intensities of the lines at 70 ppm and 35 ppm, although the Al content in this sample did not change, as chemical analysis showed (see Table 1). Perhaps, AlEt3 displaces the surface species with 5-coordinated Al and 6-coordinated Al with three chlorine ligands. To check this suggestion, we treated sample AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 (Fig. 1c) with a solution of AlEt3 at molar ratio AlEt3/(AlEt2Cl)surface=30 for 50 min (Table 1, sample 6). The spectrum of this sample (Fig. 1d) is similar to that in Fig. 1a. We conclude that the process of chemical exchange of the surface and dissolved Al compounds occurs in these systems. Equilibrium is shifted towards binding of AlEt2Cl, since a priori the adsorption heat of AlEt2Cl exceeds that of AlEt3. To provide a more profound displacement of AlEt2Cl from the catalyst surface, the excess of AlEt3 is required. Besides, catalyst surface retains the tightly adsorbed Al compound (most likely AlEt2Cl) which coordination corresponds to the 27 Al NMR line at ca. 10 ppm. The time of equilibrium achievement depends on experimental conditions and seems to exceed several minutes. The above chemical analysis data confirm that in this system OAC can adsorb both on free surface centres of MgCl2 and on TiCl3. It should be noted that we cannot distinguish AlEt2Cl adsorbed on MgCl2 from that adsorbed on TiCl3 forming in this system. We carried out an adsorption of AlEt2Cl on TiCl3 so as to check the above supposition. For this purpose we treated a sample of α-TiCl3 (S BET=52 m2/g) with AlEt2Cl at a molar ratio Ti/Al=40 at ambient temperature. The 27 Al NMR spectrum of the obtained sample is shown on Fig. 1e. The position of the main line is ca. 10 ppm, which is close to one of the lines in the spectrum of AlEt2Cl/MgCl2. TiCl3 formed at the reduction of supported TiCl4/MgCl2 exists on the catalyst surface predominantly in a form of associates (TiCl3) x replicating the structure of the MgCl2 surface [12]. The coordination environment of Al in OAC adsorbed on TiCl3 is likely to be the same, as in OAC adsorbed on MgCl2. The spectrum of sample AlEt2Cl/TMC is presented on Fig. 1f. It consists of two lines—the main line at 10 ppm and a less intensive line shifted to low field. The first line may be attributed to adsorbed AlEtCl2, quite likely forming in this system. It should be noted that the previously recorded spectrum of sample AlEtCl2/MgCl2 consisted of a similar line [10]. However, the main line cannot be unambiguously attributed to AlEtCl2, since the same line is observed in the spectrum of sample AlEt2Cl/MgCl2 (Fig. 1c). The line at 70–80 ppm seems to correspond to small amounts of adsorbed AlEt2Cl. Adding monomers to catalyst AlEt3/TMC (sample 2), we obtained samples containing ca. 1 g of polymer per 1 g of catalyst (samples 2 and 4 from Table 1). Fig. 2 a shows the spectra of AlEt3/TMC before and after polymerization of ethylene. After polymerization, the spectrum of the catalyst contains a broad line with a maximum at ∼10 ppm. The polymer formation did not practically change the 27 Al NMR spectrum of triethyl-treated TMC. The spectra of the samples after ethylene or propylene polymerization are close. The spectra of the ethylene- or propylene-treated sample AlEt2Cl/TMC are the same as for the initial catalyst. It should be noted that the AlEt2Cl system produced half as many polymer (0.4–0.6 g/g cat) as the AlEt3 system did, polymerization conditions being the same (Table 1). The spectrum of sample AlOct3/TMC (Fig. 2b) is similar to that of AlEt3/TMC (Fig. 1a). The lines at 70 and 35 ppm disappear from the spectrum of the sample after polymerization of ethylene (Fig. 2b). The spectra of samples AlOct3/TMC/PE and AlOct3/TMC/PP are close. A fraction of Al compounds disappeared from 27 Al NMR spectra after polymerization attains ca. 20% of total Al content. Possible reasons of disappearance from the 27 Al NMR spectra of this part of Al atoms are the removal of Al complexes from surface or disordering of Al coordination environment, as it has been observed for AlEt3/MgCl2 [10]. The spectra of samples AlOct3/TMC/PE and AlOct3/TMC/PP are similar to those of samples AlEt3/TMC/PE and AlEt3/TMC/PP (Fig. 2a). So, we can conclude that surface dialkylaluminium chlorides Al1 and Al2, corresponding to the lines at 70 and 35 ppm on the 27 Al NMR spectra of samples AlEt3/TMC and AlOct3/TMC, are more labile compared with surface complexes Al3, characterised by the line at 5–10 ppm. As the catalyst reacts with excess of AlR3 or participates in polymerization, the lines at 70 and 35 ppm disappear from its spectrum. We suggest that these results can be explained in the following way. Compounds Al1 (75 ppm) and Al2 (35 ppm) are reversibly adsorbed on the catalyst surface, including titanium trichloride—the active component of the catalyst. Active centres can be formed only after Al1 and Al2 desorption, for example, under the action of excess AlR3. Forming on the catalyst surface, the polymer inhibits reversible adsorption of dialkylaluminium chloride or disorders the coordination environment of Al in adsorbed AlR2Cl (Al/Ti ratio in samples with polymer remains the same, see Table 1). As a result, the line corresponding to 5-coordinated Al disappears from the 27 Al NMR spectrum. Surface compounds Al3, corresponding to the line with a chemical shift of 5–10 ppm, are tightly adsorbed on catalyst and thus can block a significant amount of Ti ions during the whole period of polymerization. 4 Conclusion It has been found with the use of 27 Al NMR that as catalyst TiCl4/MgCl2 is treated with aluminium trialkyl, the formed dialkylaliminium chloride adsorbs on catalyst surface; 27 Al NMR spectra demonstrate three types of surface aluminium complexes with different coordination state. The fraction of complexes of each type depends on the conditions of the interaction of catalyst with trialkylaluminium. The changes in the spectra of samples after polymerization (yield 1 g polymer/1 g cat) indicate that part of the Al compounds is removed from catalyst surface or that the coordination environment of Al in this compound became disordered. The existence of aluminium compound unremovable from the catalysts surface indicates that efforts have to be undertaken so as to prevent its formation at interaction of catalysts with co-catalyst. Based on these results, we suppose that the portion of Ti ions in active state is governed by the process of adsorption/desorption of OAC (most likely, chlorine-containing OAC derivatives), which, being adsorbed, blocks active centres. Practically, this means that excess of trialkylaluminium is required for polymerization. This suggestion explains the low co-catalytic efficiency of AlEt2Cl in olefin polymerization.
