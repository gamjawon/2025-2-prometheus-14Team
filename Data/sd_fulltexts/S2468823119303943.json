Graphical abstract Proposed structure-activity relationship of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst (a), Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst (b) and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst (c) for selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3. Each active site on catalysts with multiple active sites is vital important to their catalytic performance, how to assemble these active sites to obtain the best performance is an attractive spot. In this work, the CeO2-WO3-TiO2 (CeWTi: Ce-W/Ti, Ce/W/Ti and W/Ce/Ti) catalysts with different loading sequence of CeO2 (redox site) and WO3 (acidic site) were prepared to investigate the active sites assembly effect on their catalytic performance for NH3-SCR reaction. Catalytic activity evaluation proposed that active sites assembly effect depends largely on the ratio of CeO2/WO3 and had a significantly influence on NOx removal efficiency over CeWTi catalysts (espeicially for Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 (mass weight)). From the analysis of surface properties, different assemble of active sites would affect the redox and acid properties of CeWTi catalysts. Reaction process study by in situ DRIFT suggested that the reaction over CeWTi catalysts followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism at low temperature but Eley–Rideal (E–R) mechanism at high temperature. Based on the analysis of the reaction process, it was concluded that the control step of NH3-SCR reaction over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was the adsorption and activation of NH3. Through this study, we constructed a study strategy of active sites assembly effect that might contribute to understand the catalytic mechanism over catalysts with multiple active sites. Keywords CeO2-WO3-TiO2 Active sites assembly Acid sites Redox sites NH3-SCR 1 Introduction NOx cause serious environmental problems, such as stratospheric ozone depletion, photochemical smog and acid rain [1]. Nowadays, one of the commonly used technologies for controlling NOx emissions is selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (NH3-SCR) using commercial V2O5/WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 catalysts [2]. Although such catalysts exhibited good activity at 300–420 °C, vanadium-based catalysts are still not satisfactory due to the narrow working temperature window, toxicity of V2O5 and low N2 selectivity at high temperature [2,3]. Therefore, a new catalyst without vanadium species is desirable to develop. In recent years, CeO2 has attracted more and more attention due to the excellent redox properties, low cost and non-toxic. Nowadays, cerium oxide based catalysts, such as CeO2/TiO2 [4–7], CeO2/WO3 [8,9], CeO2/Al2O3 [10], CeO2/ZrO2 [11], CeO2-Nb2O5 [12] and CeO2/MnOx [13] have been studied. Among them, CeO2/TiO2 based catalysts have been widely applied for industrial denitrification due to its wide active window and environmental friendliness. [6,14–16]. Mechanism studies proposed that CeO2 mainly determines the redox properties and TiO2 are major sites for NH3 adsorption on CeO2/TiO2 catalyst during NH3-SCR reaction [17,18]. However, the acidic of TiO2 is so weak that cannot achieve a perfect match with the redox of CeO2 (especially at high loading content of CeO2) to obtain the best activity. Therefore, many studies have focused on the modification of CeO2/TiO2 catalyst with acidic substance [3,19–21]. WO3 as a solid super acid caught the most attention of researchers, thus many studies about WO3 promoting the activity of CeO2/TiO2 catalyst have been reported [9,21–23]. These studies proved that the introduction of WO3 can significantly improve acidic and redox of CeO2/TiO2 catalyst, thereby improve their NH3-SCR performance. Another more interesting finding is that CeWTi catalysts with different loading sequence of CeO2 and WO3 would lead to differences in activity [21,23]. As far as we know, however, no research has done to explain these. To obtain a better catalyst, the precise structure-activity relationship should be constructed. Herein, we synthesized Ce-W/Ti, Ce/W/Ti and W/Ce/Ti catalysts with different CeO2/WO3 proportions by wet impregnation method. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of active sites assembly on NH3-SCR processes over CeWTi catalysts and establish their precise structure-activity relationship. We expected this work would contribute to accelerating industrial application of CeWTi catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO2-WO2-TiO2 (CeWTi) catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. The Ce-W/Ti (CeO2 and WO3 were loaded together) catalyst was synthesized by the following process. The calculated amount of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, (NH4)6W7O24·6H2O and TiO2 support (Aladdin, 10–25 nm) were mixed in distilled water. Subsequently, the mixture solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h. After that, the obtained solution was dried at 120 °C for 5 h and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air. For preparation of Ce/W/Ti (loading CeO2 after WO3 was loaded) and W/Ce/Ti (loading WO3 after CeO2 was loaded) catalyst, the method was similar to the process described above, but the difference was that this process should be carried twice in the loading of CeO2 and WO3. In the text, the different content of CeO2 and WO3 in CeWTi catalysts was abbreviated as CexWyTiz (x, y and z represented the weight content of CeO2, WO3 and TiO2, respectively, e.g. Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8.) 2.2 Catalytic activity test The NH3-SCR activity measurements were tested in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 5 mm). The components of the reactant gas were 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 5% O2, 200 ppm SO2 (when used), 3 vol% H2O (when used) and balanced N2. 0.2 g catalyst of 40–80 mesh was used to test. The flow rate was 200 ml/min, corresponding to the GHSV of 60,000 h−1. The concentration of NO and NO2 were measured by an infrared gas analyzer (IS10 FT-IR). The NOX conversion were calculated by follows: NOX conversion (%) = ([NOX]in − [NOX]out)/[NOx]in × 100% 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD, Purkinje XD-3), BET experiments (Quantachrome Instruments, USA), HR-TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5000C, ESCA), automated chemisorption analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT, Nicolet IZ10 FTIR spectrometer) were performed. The experimental details are presented in the supplementary material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance Fig. 1 shows the NOx conversion of CeO2-WO3-TiO2 catalysts with different CeO2/WO3 ratios. Each catalyst showed a wide active temperature window from 240 to 450 °C (the conversion of NOx was higher than 85%). Obviously, the loading sequence of CeO2 and WO3 and the loading ratio of CeO2/WO3 had a significant influence on the catalytic activity of CeWTi catalysts. Apparently, Ce/W/Ti catalyst displayed the highest activity below 240 °C and W/Ce/Ti exhibited the best catalytic activity when the reaction temperature was higher than 350 °C, which suggested that loading CeO2 after (before) WO3 was favorable for low (high) temperature NH3-SCR. From the N2O concentration presented in Fig S1, no evident difference could be observed, indicating active sites assemble effect had little impact on N2 selectively [22–24]. When the content of CeO2 was more than or equal to WO3 (Fig. 1a, b, c and e), the catalytic activity of CeWTi catalysts followed the order of Ce/W/Ti > W/Ce/Ti > Ce-W/Ti at low temperatures (120–270 °C) and W/Ce/Ti > Ce/W/Ti > Ce-W/Ti at high temperatures (300–450 °C). Since the Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts with different loading sequences displayed the largest difference in activity (Fig. 1c), we selected the Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts to study the effect of active sites assembly on catalyst performance. The influence of SO2 and water vapor on Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was evaluated at 250 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 , when 200 ppm SO2 and 3 vol.% H2O was added, the activity of catalysts decreased and the SCR activity recovered to some extent when SO2 and water vapor were cut off. The NOX conversion of the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 recovered to more than 85%. The anti-toxicity of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was the worst, but the NOX conversion still could recover to about 75%. This result indicated that the tolerance of H2O and SO2 over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was good. It could be concluded that the assemble of active sites also has a great influence on the resistance of SO2 and H2O. We would make further research in the future work. 3.2 Catalyst characterization Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts. For all catalysts, anatase phase (PDF#21–1272) was detected as the main phase and a peak at 28.6° (2θ) was attributed to cubic CeO2 (PDF#01-0562). Notably, Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst showed tri-peaks at 23–25° which were attributed to WO3 (PDF#20–1323). It could be concluded that co-impregnation of CeO2 and WO3 could lead to the crystallinity of WO3. The other XRD patterns of CeWTi catalysts with different CeO2/WO3 ratio were presented in Fig S2. HR-TEM images were shown in Fig. S3. By comparison, the obvious agglomeration of active components was observed on Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst (Fig. S3a), while Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 showed better dispersion. As shown in Fig. S3d–f, the lattice fringe of 0.35 nm, 0.32 nm and 0.37 nm corresponded to anatase (101) phase, CeO2 (111) and WO3 (200), respectively. The lattice fringe of WO3 could be found on Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst (Fig. S3d), but could not be found on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalysts. Moreover, the agglomeration of TiO2 on Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was obvious, which was not conductive to the dispersion of the active components on the carrier. This conclusion was consistent with the result of XRD. Moreover, the BET data were summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S4. The surface area of these catalysts was similar, which indicated that the surface area has little effect on the catalytic activity. XPS was tested to study the surface chemical properties. The surface elements content of Ce, W, O and Ti of catalysts were shown in Table 2 . The ratio of surface elements of Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was similar. The content of Ce and W species on the Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was the least, but the content of Ti species was the most. This result indicated that agglomeration of CeO2 and WO3 occurred on Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst, which made the TiO2 carrier exposed more. Moreover, the conclusion was consistent with the results of XRD and TEM. The XPS spectra of Ce 3d were shown in Fig. 4 a, the bands labeled u´ and v´ were attributed to Ce3+ species and the bands labeled u, u″, u‴, v, v″ and v‴ were attributed to Ce4+ species [25]. Notably, the Ce3+ was beneficial for the oxidation of NO to NO2 [26]. The Ce3+ ratio calculated by Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) was Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 (32.9%), Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 (43.7%) and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 (26.5%). This result confirmed that pre- or co-impregnated W species could promote the formation of Ce3+ during the process of loading CeO2. It is well known that redox equilibrium of Ce3++W6+⇋Ce4++W5+ can be induced by the interaction of Ce and W species [22,27]. In this work, the precursor of CeO2 and WO3 were the most commonly used cerium nitrate (Ce3+) and ammonium paratungstate (W6+), respectively. Thus, the electron of Ce3+ might be retained in the form of W5+ during the formation of CeO2 and released due to redox shift of Ce3++W6+⇋Ce4++W5+. It must be noting that the dispersed WO3 could form stronger interaction with CeO2 than crystalline WO3, thus it had better electron transfer ability. Therefore, Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 showed higher Ce3+ ratio than Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8. Moreover, since the CeO2 had formed a stable structure in the preparation of CeO2/TiO2, it is difficult to transfer electrons when WO3 was loaded. Therefore, the ratio of Ce3+ on the W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was the least. The XPS spectra of W 4f were shown in Fig. 4b. Two main peaks in the range from 32 to 40 eV could be assigned to W 4f 7/2 (around 35.6 eV) and W 4f 5/2 (around 37.6 eV). And the peaks were both assigned to W6+ [27]. Apparently, the binding energy of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 was lower than the others, which revealed that the tungsten species on Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst exhibited higher density of electron cloud. This result represented that it was difficult to transfer electrons between WO3 and CeO2, so the ratio of Ce3+ in the Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was small [28]. The O 1s (Ti 2p) spectra were shown in Fig. 4c (d). There was no change in the position and intensity of peaks, which indicated that the active sites assembly has little effect on surface oxygen and the carrier. 3.3 Redox and acid properties H2-TPR were performed to study the redox property. According to the literature, the reduction peaks below 500 °C were assigned to the reduction of CeO2 and the reduction peaks at 500–800 °C were assigned to the reduction of WO3 [29,30]. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the shape and position of peaks presented by three catalysts below 500 °C were similar. However, Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst showed a larger reduction peak area of CeO2 than the others, which indicated that the redox of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was stronger than the others. Previous literatures had reported that the better redox properties would improve the catalyst activity [31–33]. In this study, however, Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst displayed the worst NOx conversion at low temperature. Thus, the redox property of Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 were enough to ensure the NH3-SCR reaction activity at low temperature. In other words, the controlling factor of low temperature NH3-SCR over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts might be the adsorption and activation of NH3. Acidity is another crucial factor in SCR reaction. NH3-TPD patterns were performed among Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8, Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 samples. As shown in Fig. 5b, the curves showed two peaks at 100–500 °C. According to the reports, the desorption peaks below 250 °C were assigned to the weak acid sites and the peaks located at above 250 °C were assigned to the strong Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites. [34,35]. As to the peaks above 500 °C, it could be assigned to the desorption of lattice oxygen of WO3 species (Seen O2-TPD in Fig. S5). Apparently, three Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts showed a similar NH3 desorption peak below 377 °C, suggesting that the adsorption sites for NH3 on Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts might be the same. In addition, W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 exhibited a bigger NH3 desorption peak at 377–500 °C, which proposed that a part of NH3 adsorbed on later loaded WO3 might be very stable at low temperature and this stable NH3 species leaded to the highest activity of W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 above 350 °C. 3.4 Reaction process mechanism study In order to study the NH3 adsorption-desorption behaviors over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 samples, the catalysts were pre-adsorbed with NH3 for 0.5 h and then purged with N2 to eliminate physisorption NH3. The in situ DRIFT spectra were collected at different temperature. As shown in Fig. 6 , the tri-peaks in the range of 3400 cm−1 to 3100 cm−1 were assigned to the NH stretching vibrations of NH3. In terms of Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 sample displayed in Fig. 6b, the bands at 1584 cm−1 and 1196 cm−1 were attributed to the NH3 bound to Lewis acid sites. The bands at 1661 cm−1 and 1447 cm−1 were attributed to the bending vibrations of NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites [36–38]. Moreover, the bands of the three kinds of catalysts were in the nearby position, indicating that the NH3 adsorption sites were the same over the three kinds of catalysts. It was worth noting that the peaks on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 6b) disappeared in a lower temperature (250 °C) and the peaks of the other two catalysts disappeared at 300 °C, indicating that NH3 was more easily to be activated on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst. The in situ DRIFT spectra of NO + O2 adsorption were collected at different temperature to study the nitrates adsorption-desorption behaviors over Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8, Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 samples. As shown in Fig. 7 , the adsorption peaks were in the same position, indicating that the type of adsorbed nitrogen oxide species were the same. Several bands on the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 7b) were assigned to monodentate nitrates (1357 cm−1), chelating bidentate nitrates (1579 cm−1) and bridging bidentate nitrates (1273 and 1602 cm−1) [36,39]. It was worth noting that the amount of nitrates adsorbed on the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 sample (Fig. 7b) was the most, which indicated that the oxidation ability of the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was strong. In the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 sample, the intensity of the peaks decreased dramatically within 200–300 °C, indicating that the nitrate species were easily to be activated on this catalyst in this temperature range. Previous studies suggested that NO3- could be decomposed into NO2 by reacting with adsorbed NO, thereby promoting the “fast-SCR” route and promoting the deNOx activity [28,40,41]. The amount of nitrates adsorbed by the W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 was the least. However, the activation of nitrate species occurred at the lowest temperature on the W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8. The activation temperature of nitrate species on the Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was the highest, indicating that the reaction was difficult to occur. In addition, no adsorbed nitrate species could be observed above 300 °C in the Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts. The reactions between pre-adsorbed NH3 and NO + O2 were conducted to investigate the reaction between gaseous NO + O2 and adsorbed NH3 at 150 °C. As shown in Fig. 8 , the bands of NH3 adsorbed species could be observed after NH3 adsorption. With the purging of NO + O2, the bands of the NH3 species disappeared gradually. In the case of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 8a), the peaks assigned to the NH3 species disappeared until 30 min and no new band attributed to nitrate species was detected. Compared to Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8, the bands attributed to the adsorbed NH3 species disappeared more quickly on the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 8b) and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 8c) catalysts, wherein all of the bands attributed to the adsorbed NH3 species disappeared after purged with NO + O2 for 20 min. Meanwhile, new bands assigned to nitrate species were detected and the intensity of the peaks on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was much stronger than W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8. In conclusion, NO + O2 could react with the adsorbed NH3 species and the reaction rate on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was the fastest. The reactions between pre-adsorbed nitrate species and NH3 were conducted to investigate the reaction between gaseous NH3 and pre-adsorbed nitrate species at 150 °C. Fig. 9 shows that the bands assigned to nitrate species could be observed after NO + O2 adsorption. With the purging of NH3, the bands of nitrate species disappeared gradually. In the case of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 9a), the peaks of the nitrate species disappeared after 5 min and the peaks of the ammonia species were detected at 10 min. Compared to Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8, the peaks assigned to the nitrate species disappeared faster on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 9b) and W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 (Fig. 9c) catalysts. When these catalysts were purged with NH3 for just 1 min, all of the bands attributed to the nitrate species disappeared. Meanwhile, new peaks assigned to the NH3 appeared. It could be concluded that NH3 could react with nitrate species, so the NH3-SCR reaction on Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism at low temperature [38,42]. Fig. 10 shows the in situ DRIFT spectra of NH3 + NO + O2 co-adsorption on catalysts at 50–400 °C. No obvious peak of adsorbed nitrate species but only the adsorbed ammonia species could be found in the spectra of samples. There are two possible reasons to explain the result. The first one was that the NH3-SCR reaction might occur in E–R mechanism. Another was that NH3-SCR reaction might occur in L–H mechanism, but the reaction rate of NH3 with nitrate species was so fast that could not be detected by DRIFT. However, the results presented in Figs. 7 and 9 had revealed that no adsorbed nitrate species could be observed above 300 °C and the reaction rate between NH3 and nitrate species was very fast at 150 °C. Therefore, the NH3-SCR reaction over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was process via L–H mechanism at the temperature below 300 °C and E–R mechanism at the temperature above 300 °C. Moreover, it could be drawn that the key factor in controlling NH3-SCR over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was the adsorption and activation of NH3. 3.5 Analysis of active sites assembly effect Based on all above discussion, possible active sites assembly effect was proposed. As shown in Fig. 11 , the different assemble of active sites would affect their space distribution. And the space distribution of active sites played a vital role in the structure and surface properties of catalysts. For Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalyst, the co-impregnation of CeO2 and WO3 could improve the redox properties of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8. However, the superior redox property of Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 was favorable for the excessive oxidation of NH3 then lead to its lowest NOx conversion at high temperature (>350 °C). In addition, the crystalline phase of WO3 performed worse than the well dispersed WO3 in activating NH3. According to the in situ DRIFT results, however, the control step for NH3-SCR reaction over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was the adsorption and activation of NH3. Therefore, Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8 showed the worst catalytic activity at low temperature. On the other hand, WO3 species were well-dispersed over the Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst. These WO3 species could form strong interaction with the later loaded CeO2 so that highest Ce3+ ions ratio was obtained. Combined with the above excellent properties, the activation temperature of NH3 on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was lower than the others, thus it showed the best activity at low temperature. Although the dispersion of WO3 on W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst was well, these dispersed WO3 had a poor interaction with pre-loaded CeO2 species. Hence, the ability of W0.1/Ce0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst to activate NH3 was worse than Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 but better than Ce0.1-W0.1/Ti0.8. Furthermore, its worst redox property was beneficial to obtain the best catalytic activity at reaction temperature above 350 °C. The kinetic test was experimented to further prove the results of activity order. The details and results were presented in the supplementary material. And the result was consistent with the previous conclusion. 4 Conclusion Based on the above results and discussions, active sites assembly effect would affect the acidity and redox properties of Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts. Combined with the analysis of the reaction process, it was concluded that the control step of NH3-SCR reaction at low temperature for Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was the adsorption and activation of NH3. Structure characterization and reaction process analysis suggested that Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 catalyst could make dispersed WO3 transfer electrons easier, then form more Ce3+ and promote the NH3-SCR process via “fast SCR”. Moreover, the NH3-SCR reaction over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was proven to occur via the L–H mechanism at low temperature and E–R mechanism at high temperature. The better synergism between CeO2 and WO3 on Ce0.1/W0.1/Ti0.8 made the SCR reaction more likely to occur. We hope this study will be useful for the design of new NH3-SCR catalysts in the future.

        "dc:description": "Each active site on catalysts with multiple active sites is vital important to their catalytic performance, how to assemble these active sites to obtain the best performance is an attractive spot. In this work, the CeO2-WO3-TiO2 (CeWTi: Ce-W/Ti, Ce/W/Ti and W/Ce/Ti) catalysts with different loading sequence of CeO2 (redox site) and WO3 (acidic site) were prepared to investigate the active sites assembly effect on their catalytic performance for NH3-SCR reaction. Catalytic activity evaluation proposed that active sites assembly effect depends largely on the ratio of CeO2/WO3 and had a significantly influence on NOx removal efficiency over CeWTi catalysts (espeicially for Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 (mass weight)). From the analysis of surface properties, different assemble of active sites would affect the redox and acid properties of CeWTi catalysts. Reaction process study by in situ DRIFT suggested that the reaction over CeWTi catalysts followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism at low temperature but Eley–Rideal (E–R) mechanism at high temperature. Based on the analysis of the reaction process, it was concluded that the control step of NH3-SCR reaction over Ce0.1W0.1Ti0.8 catalysts was the adsorption and activation of NH3. Through this study, we constructed a study strategy of active sites assembly effect that might contribute to understand the catalytic mechanism over catalysts with multiple active sites.",
