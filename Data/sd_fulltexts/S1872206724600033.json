ABSTRACT Fabrication of porous hierarchical structures is an effective method to improve the photo-absorption capability of photocatalysts by enhancing the photogenerated charge separation and transfer. In-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are utilized as self-sacrificial templates to synthesize various hierarchical In2S3 photocatalysts including hollow nanotubes/microtubes/ spheres and dodecahedrons by the sulfidation process. The porous hierarchical structures improve multiple refraction and reflection of the incident light, provide larger surface areas, and increase the light utilization and phase separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. As a result, the photocatalytic efficiency is much higher than that of the bulk and commercial In2S3. In particular, the hollow In2S3 nanotubes (HNTs) have the best photocatalytic properties boosting degradation rates of organic pollutants that are 135.6 and 446.9 times than those of the bulk and commercial-grade In2S3, respectively. Theoretical calculations, optical/electrical characterization, and free radical trapping experiments reveal that under the condition of light, the photogenerated electron hole pairs produced in In2S3-HNT can effectively separate due to its hierarchical porous structure. So, the In2S3-HNT can accumulate more reactive oxygen radicals. This novel self-sacrificial template method has large potential in the design and fabrication of hierarchical high-efficiency photocatalysts. Graphical Abstract Four indium sulfide materials derived from metal-organic frameworks with different morphologies were constructed by self-sacrificing template method, and the performance of photocatalytic pollutant degradation was increased by adjusting the hierarchical porous morphology. Keywords In2S3 Metal-organic framework Morphological control Photocatalysis Pollutants degradation 1 Introduction Semiconductor-based photocatalysis is one of the promising strategies to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the carbon footprint and environmental pollution [1–6]. Although carbon nitride [7], metal oxides [8–10] and bismuth halide oxide [11–12] have been proposed as photocatalysts, the photocatalytic efficiency cannot satisfy commercial needs due to their low solar energy utilization, weak redox potentials, and fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs [13–16]. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the catalytic efficiency of photocatalysts [17–19]. The common techniques include the introduction of suitable heterojunctions [20–24] and defects [25,26]. However, the heterojunction interfaces and defects can serve as recombination centers for photogenerated carriers, consequently affecting adversely the separation of electron-hole pairs and carrier lifetime. By constructing porous hierarchical structures, the light absorption properties of photocatalysts can be improved due to the larger surface area and smaller photogenerated carrier recombination rates [27–29]. Nevertheless, it is important to be able to control the crystal morphology in the hierarchical structures to obtain the best performance and stability. Morphological control can be accomplished by the hard-template method and soft-template method [30]. The hard-template method utilizing silicon/polystyrene spheres, mesoporous silica/carbon templates, and so on produces porous hierarchical nanomaterials by encapsulating or filling the templates with active materials [31,32]. On the other hand, the soft templates based on ionic liquids, block polymers, anionic/cationic surfactants, and other materials produce the desirable morphology by micelles-confined growth of nanomaterials [33,34]. However, in the hard-template method, the conditions needed to remove the hard template agents are quite stringent frequently resulting in partial collapse of the porous structure. In the soft-template method, the inherent instability of soft templates renders them vulnerable to fluctuations in the pH and temperature during synthesis. Furthermore, the majority of soft templates consist of multi-carbon chains which not only are expensive, but also contribute to environmental pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need to contrive novel approaches to prepare nanomaterials with diverse morphologies, especially semiconducting materials with good optical and electrical properties. Sun et al. [35] have prepared yolk-shell silicon@void@carbon composites by the self-sacrificial template strategy for lithium-ion batteries and Xu et al. [36] have used the sacrificial template method to synthesize carbon nanosheets with abundant active Fe-N4O1 groups assembled on hollow spheres to enhance electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. Owing to the environmental friendliness, the self-sacrificial template method has broad prospects in the future [37]. Herein, In-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are utilized as self-sacrificial templates to synthesize various hierarchical In2S3 photocatalysts including hollow nanotubes/microtubes/spheres and dodecahedrons by the sulfidation process. The porous hierarchical structures increase the surface area and light absorption capability while mitigating the recombination of photogenerated charges. Among the various nanostructures, In2S3-HNT possesses the best photocatalytic properties as manifested by rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline (TC) degradation rates that are 135.6 and 7.8 times than those of bulk In2S3 (In2S3-bulk) and 446.9 and 36.5 times of those of commercial In2S3 (In2S3-COM), respectively. Our comprehensive analysis based on photo/electrical tests, free radical trapping experiments, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) reveals that In2S3-HNT produces the largest concentration of surface photogenerated electrons and holes besides more reactive oxygen species. The results and mechanistic study provide ideas for the design and preparation of the efficient photocatalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and synthesis Indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O), indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·xH2O), 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (C6H4N2S), 2,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid (C7H5NO4), 4,5-imidazole dicarboxylic acid (C5H4N2O4), and benzimidazole (C7H6N2) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Urea (CH4N2O) and N,N-dimethyl formamide (C3H7NO, DMF) and thiourea (CH4N2S) were obtained from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used without purification. The precursors were synthesized according to the reported methods with some modifications as shown in Scheme 1 . 2.1.1 Synthesis of In(OH)3 0.5 g of InCl3·4H2O and 4 g of urea were dissolved in 45 mL of distilled water and stirred for 30 min. Then transferred the clear solution to a 100 mL round-bottomed flask and heated to 80 °C for 2 h. After cooling to the room temperature, the white solid was collected, washed several times in distilled water, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.1.2 Synthesis of MIL-68-In 0.06 g of In(NO3)3·xH2O and 0.06 g of H2BDC were dissolved in 40 mL of DMF and stirred for 5 min. Then the solution was transferred to a 100 mL round-bottom flask and heated to 120 °C for 0.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the white solid was collected, washed several times with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.1.3 Synthesis of In(OH)(2,5-PDC) 0.03 g of C7H5NO4 and 0.02 g of C6H4N2S were dissolved in 4 mL of DMF and 6 mL distilled water and stirred for 60 min. The solution was placed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the white solid was collected, rinsed several times with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.1.4 Synthesis of In-rho-ZMOFs 0.045 g of In(NO3)3·xH2O, 0.063 g of C5H4N2O4, and 0.3 g of C7H6N2 were dissolved in 18 mL of DMF and stirred for 10 min. The solution was put in a 100 mL round-bottom flask and heated to 120 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the white solid was collected, washed several times with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.1.5 Vulcanization of precursors As shown in Scheme 1, thiourea (0.15 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol to which In(OH)3/MIL-68-In/In(OH)(2,5-PDC)/ In-rho-ZMOFs (0.05 g) was added prior to sonication. The solutions were transferred to 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves and heated to 180 °C for 24 h. After the solvothermal reaction, the products were rinsed several times with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C overnight. The resulting materials were denoted as hollow In2S3 nanotubes (In2S3-HNT), hollow In2S3 microtubes (In2S3-HMT), hollow In2S3 spheres (In2S3-HS), and In2S3 porous dodecahedrons (In2S3-PD), respectively. 2.1.6 Synthesis of bulk-In2S3 1 mmol sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) and 1 mmol InCl3·4H2O were grinded and calcined to 200 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min under the air atmosphere in a tube furnace for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the yellow solid was collected and washed several times with deionized water and alcohol, then dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.2 Materials characterization The morphology of the materials was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JOEL JSM-7800F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos 200×), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI Talos 200×). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on the Shimadzu XRD-6000X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation and the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were acquired on the UV-3600 Plus spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The elemental composition and chemical states of the samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi). The intermediates formed during RhB degradation were analyzed by the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Thermo LXQ LC/MS) in which the mobile phase contain 30% methanol and 70% water and the flow rate is 1.0 μL/min. And TC was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (ThermoLXQ LC/MS). The surface area analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA) was used to determine the specific surface area and particle size based on the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The photocurrent tests were performed in Na2SO4 with a concentration of 0.2 mol/L and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in a solution containing 0.1 mol/L KCl and 5 mmol/L Fe(CN)6 3–/Fe(CN)6 4–. The Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis was done in 1 mol/L KCl using the standard 3-electrode configuration on an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments Company). The photoluminescence (PL, QM4m) spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Electron spin resonance (ESR) was conducted on the Bruker JES-FA200 spectrometer to detect the superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals under light exposure. 2.3 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation The DFT calculation was performed using the Vienna Abinitio Simulation Package (VASP) and projected augmented wave method (PAW) [38]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function was used to deal with the exchange-correlation energy within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [39]. The structure of In2S3 was first optimized. The energy cutoff of the plane wave was 420 eV and the k-point was 3 × 3 × 1. The convergence criteria for structural optimization and energy were 0.03 eV/Å and 10–4 eV, respectively. The k-point was set to be 9 × 9 × 1 and the destiny of state (DOS) was calculated [40]. 2.4 Photocatalytic experiments The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of the RhB solution (20 mg/L) and TC solution (10 mg/L), respectively. The temperature was maintained at 30 °C with a circulating water system. An air pump was employed to provide a sufficient amount of oxygen during the reaction. The Pyrex photocatalytic reactor was equipped with a 250 W Xe lamp (Wavelength: 420 nm; Operating Voltage: 220 V; Yangzhou University Town Science and Education Equipment Co., Ltd.). Before light irradiation by the Xe lamp, the suspensions were stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Afterward, the suspension (about 3 mL) was collected every 15 min and centrifuged. The absorbance of RhB and TC was monitored at 553 nm and 356 nm by the UV-vis spectrophotometry and the photocatalytic properties of the samples were determined based on the absorbance. 3 Results and discussion The morphology of the samples was examined by SEM and TEM. The In(OH)3 precursor has a rod-like structure with vertical stripes approximately 1.7 µm in length and 0.5 µm in diameter (Figs. 1(a) and (b) ). The MIL-68-In precursor manifests as a hexagonal prism with an approximate length of 7 µm (Figs. 1(f) and (g)). The In(OH)(2,5-PDC) structure shows the form of a hollow sphere with a diameter of about 500 nm (Figs. 1(k) and (l)), while In-rho-ZMOFs is a dodecahedron with a smooth surface of about 1 µm (Figs. 1(p) and (q)). After sulfidation, In2S3-HNT shows a hollow tubular configuration adorned with In2S3 nanosheets (Figs. 1(c) and (d)), and In2S3-HMT has a micrometer-scale hollow tubular structure with abundant nanosheets on the surface (Figs. 1(h) and (i)). In2S3-HS retains the hollow spherical morphology of the precursor (Figs. 1(m) and (n)) with In2S3 nanosheets on the surface. In2S3-PD changes from smooth dodecahedrons characteristic of the precursor to dodecahedrons with mesopores (Figs. 1(r) and (s)). The structure was further analyzed by HR-TEM. The lattice spacing of 0.31 nm corresponds to the (222) crystal facet of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, and In2S3-PD, while that of 0.27 nm stems from the (400) crystal plane of In2S3-HS (Figs. 1(e), (j), (o), (t)). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are depicted in Fig. 2(a) . All of the In2S3 samples were hithermost to the type-IV with H3 hysteresis loop in the P/P 0 range of 0.5–1.0, implying the presence of mesoporous and microporous structures. The specific surface areas of In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are 17.3, 0.71, 126.3, 56.5, 162.5, and 119.6 m2/g, respectively, As shown in Fig. S2, the relevant results were calculated using the BJH method, in which the main pore size was 2–16 nm. For the In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD, the pore sizes were 3.70, 3.60, 3.60 and 3.34 nm, respectively. This demonstrates that the porous hierarchical structures increase the surface area consequently benefiting reactant absorption and light capturing. The XRD patterns of In2S3-COM, In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD can be labeled as the tetragonal In2S3 phase (JCPDS No. 73-1366) (Figs. 2(b) and S3). The prominent diffraction peaks at 27.4°, 33.2°, 44.7°, and 55.9° correspond to the crystal facets of (1 0 9), (0 0 12), (2 2 12), and (3 0 15), respectively [41]. The XRD pattern of In2S3-bulk corresponds to the tetragonal In2S3 phase (JCPDS No. 86-0640). No impurities are observed by XRD which confirms successful preparation. The XPS survey spectra of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD in Fig. S4 show the presence of only four elements (In, S, O, and C) corroborating the high purity. The two peaks at 452.5 and 444.9 eV arise from In 3d 3/2 and In 3d 5/2, respectively (Fig. 2(c)) and the S 2p peaks at 162.6 and 161.4 eV correspond to S 2p 1/2 and S 2p 3/2, respectively (Fig. 2(d)). The density of states (DOS) was computed to analyze the band composition (Figs. 2(e)–(f)). The valence band maximum (VBM) of In2S3 consists of the S 2p orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) of In2S3 is primarily composed of the In 3d and S 2p orbitals. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was conducted to assess the light absorption capacity of the nanomaterials (Figs. 2(g) and S5). The absorption band edges of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are at 600 nm and the bandgaps (E g) are determined by the following formula: αhν = A (hν – E g) n/2. The curve of (αEphoton)2 versus Ephoton for the monomers is evaluated by the classical Tauc approach, yielding Eg of 1.78, 1.36, 1.77, 1.79, 1.77, and 1.79 eV for In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD, respectively. The band structure of In2S3 (Fig. S6) is analyzed by the bandgap, XPS valence band spectrum, and Mott-Schottky curve. The valence bands of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are 0.90, 1.04, 0.82, and 1.05 eV (Fig. 2(h)). The Mott-Schottky curves of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS and In2S3-PD are displayed in Fig. 2(i) and Fig. S7. In general, a tangent line can be made in the linear part of the Mott-Schottky curve. If the slope of the line is positive, it is an n-type semiconductor and if the slope of the line is negative, it is a p-type semiconductor. Obviously, the materials are n-type and the flat band potentials of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are –0.28, –0.35, –0.21, and –0.38 V, respectively. It has been shown that the flat band potentials of n-type semiconductors are approximately equal to the Fermi levels. The VBs of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are calculated to be 0.62, 0.69, 0.61, and 0.67 V, respectively. According to E CB = E VB – E g, the CBs of In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are –1.15, –1.10, –1.16, and –1.12 V, respectively. Hence, In2S3 has the proper bandgap for visible light absorption. TC is a common broad-spectrum antibiotic due to its affordability, and its stability and resistance to biodegradation have made it popular in the detection of surface water [42]. RhB is an industrial dye used in colored glass and specialty fireworks [43]. However, when industrial wastewater laden with substantial amounts of dyes and antibiotics is discharged without the proper pretreatment, pollution of surface and ground water can result. Conventional techniques like adsorption and membrane separation fall short of complete degradation, and chemical or biological approaches can even lead to secondary contamination [44]. In this respect, advanced photocatalytic oxidation is promising in the elimination of environmental pollutants by utilizing sunlight. In this study, the photocatalytic properties of the synthesized In2S3 are determined using TC and RhB as the model pollutants. In Table S1, the photocatalytic degradation of RhB or TC of some materials have been listed. It can be found that compared with the previous work, our materials have advantages in performance. As shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b) , degradation of RhB and TC is insignificant in the absence of photocatalysts. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of In2S3-COM and In2S3-bulk is suboptimal manifested by the removal of only about 1% and 4% of RhB after light irradiation for 2 h and 4% and 15% of TC after 1.5 h of visible light exposure, respectively. In comparison, In2S3-HNT has excellent photocatalytic properties. After light exposure for only 1.5 and 2 h, In2S3-HNT removes about 50% of TC and 95% of RhB. The kinetics follows the relationship of –ln(C/C 0) = kt (where k represents the kinetic rate constant) (Figs. 3(c), S8). The degradation rates of RhB by In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are 2.36 × 10–4, 7.16 × 10–5, 0.032, 0.0064, 0.013, and 0.0041 min–1, respectively, and those of TC by In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD are 0.0018, 3.84 × 10–4, 0.014, 0.0043, 0.0056, and 0.0042 min–1, respectively. Therefore, the degradation rate of RhB by In2S3-HNT is higher. Specifically, the rates are approximately 135.6, 446.9, 5, 2.5, and 7.8 times than those of In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD, respectively. Moreover, the degradation rate of TC by In2S3-HNT is the highest and it is 7.8, 36.5, 3.3, 2.5, and 3.3 times than those of In2S3-bulk, In2S3-COM, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD, respectively. The effects of interfering ions and pH on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency are investigated. As shown in Figs. 3(d) and (e), 1.0 mmol L–1 inorganic ions are added to study the effects of inorganic ions on the photocatalytic degradation of RhB. To investigate the impact of cations on photocatalytic degradation, NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, and NH4Cl are introduced. Furthermore, the influence of anions on photocatalytic degradation is evaluated with the aid of NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and Na2CO3. These inorganic ions do not inhibit the photocatalytic activity of In2S3-HNT. To evaluate the pH dependence, the pH of the solution is changed from 13 to 1 with 1 mol/L NaOH or HNO3. As shown in Fig. 3(f), RhB degrades faster under acidic conditions because it is a weakly alkaline dye thus enabling effective binding with the catalysts through electrostatic adsorption in the acidic environment [45,46]. The stability of In2S3-HNT is assessed by cycling. As shown in Fig. S9, the degradation efficiency of In2S3-HNT decreases slightly because of the inherent tendency of indium sulfide to undergo photo-corrosion. Nonetheless, the stability is maintained after one cycle. The In2S3-HNT after cycling was analyzed by XRD (Fig. S10), SEM (Fig. S11), and TEM (Fig. S12). The results reveal that the structure and morphology of In2S3-HNT are intact corroborating the good durability. In order to explore the resistance during charge transfer, EIS is conducted (Fig. 3(g)) [47–49]. The resistance is determined based on the diameter in the Nyquist plot, with a smaller diameter indicating a lower resistance [50,51]. The Nyquist diameter of In2S3-HNT is indeed smaller than those of the other materials thus facilitating charge transport. The results reveal that the porous hierarchical structures mitigate the impedance and promote charge transport. As shown in Fig. 3(h), according to the photocurrent intensity, the following order of In2S3-HNT > In2S3-HS > In2S3-HMT > In2S3-PD > In2S3-bulk > In2S3-COM is observed. The photocurrents of In2S3-bulk and In2S3-COM are smaller than those of other materials, indicating that In2S3-HNT, In2S3-HMT, In2S3-HS, and In2S3-PD have rapid charge separation and transfer capabilities under visible light irradiation, consequently improving the utilization rates of photogenerated carriers. The separation and recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes are analyzed by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As expected, the fluorescence from In2S3-HNT is less intense (Fig. 3(i)), suggesting suppression of photogenerated charge recombination. To study the degradation mechanism of RhB and TC, the products generated are analyzed by LC-MS. Fig. S13 displays the mass spectra of the solutions at different time points, revealing there were many small molecules formed during the degradation process. According to the identified intermediates, the degradation routes of RhB and TC are postulated. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b) , the initial step involves the adsorption of RhB molecules onto the catalyst surface. Subsequently, a cascade of reactions takes place, including N-deethylation, deamination, dealkylation, decarboxylation, cleavage of the chromophore, ring opening, and eventual mineralization. The degradation process of RhB (m/z = 443) gives rise to many intermediates such as N,N-diethyl-Nʹ-ethyl rhodamine (DER, m/z = 415), N-ethyl-N’-ethyl Rhodamine (EER, m/z = 387), Nʹ-ethyl rhodamine (ER, m/z = 362), rhodamine (R, m/z = 331), besides intermediates with m/z values of 317, 301, 279, and 217. These small molecules are gradually carbonized to form CO2 and H2O. TC (m/z = 445) is attacked by the active species to produce P3’ (m/z = 361) by hydroxyl substitution and amide group elimination. Subsequently, P3’ undergoes ring opening to yield P5’ (m/z = 244), followed by further ring opening to produce P7’ (m/z = 158). This constitutes the initial degradation pathway for TC. The second degradation route involves the dehydroxylation of TC, resulting in the formation of P2’ (m/z = 412). Subsequent ring opening of P2’ leads to the generation of P4’ (m/z = 301), which is then converted into P6’ in the sequence involving ring opening, dihydroxylation, and demethylation. Finally, these smaller molecules undergo mineralization progressively forming CO2 and H2O. In addition, the toxicity of the intermediate products was evaluated by growing mung beans (Fig. 4(c)). The root length of the sprouts irrigated with deionized water, RhB solution after treatment and RhB solution were about 9, 8 and 7 cm, respectively (Fig. 4(d)). The growth of bean sprouts cultured in untreated RhB solution was inhibited and the roots were stained. The bean sprouts grown from RhB solution after photocatalytic degradation are not much different from normal bean sprouts. This further demonstrates that organic pollutants can be effectively decomposed after the photocatalytic reaction. Free radicals trapping experiments and ESR are performed to study the active species in the photocatalytic system [52,53]. Figs. 5(a)–(c) show the free radical trapping results of In2S3-HNT under visible light irradiation. Triethanolamine (TEOA) is the hole-trapping agent, Ar is the superoxide radical inhibitor, tert-butanol (TBA) is the hydroxyl radical trapping agent, and tryptophan (Trp) is the singlet oxygen-trapping agent [54]. The photocatalytic activity of In2S3-HNT is inhibited by introducing TEOA, Trp, and Ar. However, the incorporation of TBA does not significantly impact the photocatalytic efficiency of In2S3-HNT because the VB position of In2S3-HNT is more negative than that of E 0 (∙OH/OH–) (2.38 eV vs. NHE). The results indicate that the holes, ·O2 –, and 1O2 are the main active species. To further prove the presence of these active species, ESR is performed in the presence of the materials (Figs. 5(d)–(h)). The photogenerated electrons and holes are analyzed using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-Oxyl (TEMPO) as a trapping agent (Figs. 5(d) and (e)). Holes were tested in CH3CN with a TEMPO concentration of 30 mmol/L, and the electrons were tested in oxygen-free conditions in CH3CN with a TEMPO concentration of 20 mmol/L. As a typical spin-labeled molecule, rhythms containing unpaired electrons exhibit a triplet ESR signal with an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 in the dark but under visible light irradiation, the signal strength is reduced due to the formation of TEMPOH [55]. TEMPO on In2S3-HNT is completely consumed within 10 min, indicating that In2S3-HNT generates the biggest number of photo-generated electrons and holes under simulated sunlight, and the photogenerated carrier can be separated effectively. O2 – and ·OH were tested in methanol or water with a DMPO concentration of 100 mmol/L, 1O2 was tested in methanol or water with TEMP concentration of 50 mmol/L. In the absence of light, DMPO-·O2 – (Fig. 5(f)), TEMP-1O2 (Fig. 5(g)), and DMPO-·OH (Fig. 5(h)) of the four materials show no signal under dark conditions. However, after light illumination, all four materials produce signals of DMPO-·O2 – and TEMP-1O2, and the signal from In2S3-HNT is significantly stronger than those from others. However, the DMPO-·OH signal cannot be observed from the four materials. The ESR results are in line with the EIS spectra, photocurrent curves, PL spectra, and radical capture data, revealing that the main active species produced during photocatalysis are superoxide radicals, holes, and singlet oxygen. The reaction mechanism of the catalysts is proposed according to the above results. As shown in Fig. 5(i), the process involves the excitation of electrons within the valence band (VB) of In2S3-HNT upon exposure to visible light. Subsequently, these excited electrons are transferred to the conduction band (CB) to activate molecular oxygen (O2) and generate superoxide radicals (·O2 –) and singlet oxygen (1O2) as the authentic active species. Concurrently, the positively charged holes (h+) that remain in the VB of In2S3-HNT initiate the direct oxidation of RhB and TC. 4 Conclusions In-based MOFs are used as self-sacrificial templates to synthesize hierarchical In2S3 photocatalysts by sulfidation. The porous hierarchical structures increase the specific surface area, multiple refraction and reflection of incident light, as well as light utilization and phase separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity is much higher than that of the bulk and commercial grade In2S3. Among the various structures, In2S3-HNT has the best photocatalytic properties showing an organic pollutant degradation rate that is 135.6 and 446.9 times than those of the bulk and commercial grade In2S3, respectively. Our systematical studies disclose that In2S3-HNT effectively separates the photogenerated carriers and generates more active oxygen radicals under visible light irradiation to boost the photocatalytic efficiency. The results reveal a novel strategy to design and prepare efficient photocatalytic materials.

        "dc:description": "ABSTRACT Fabrication of porous hierarchical structures is an effective method to improve the photo-absorption capability of photocatalysts by enhancing the photogenerated charge separation and transfer. In-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are utilized as self-sacrificial templates to synthesize various hierarchical In2S3 photocatalysts including hollow nanotubes/microtubes/ spheres and dodecahedrons by the sulfidation process. The porous hierarchical structures improve multiple refraction and reflection of the incident light, provide larger surface areas, and increase the light utilization and phase separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. As a result, the photocatalytic efficiency is much higher than that of the bulk and commercial In2S3. In particular, the hollow In2S3 nanotubes (HNTs) have the best photocatalytic properties boosting degradation rates of organic pollutants that are 135.6 and 446.9 times than those of the bulk and commercial-grade In2S3, respectively. Theoretical calculations, optical/electrical characterization, and free radical trapping experiments reveal that under the condition of light, the photogenerated electron hole pairs produced in In2S3-HNT can effectively separate due to its hierarchical porous structure. So, the In2S3-HNT can accumulate more reactive oxygen radicals. This novel self-sacrificial template method has large potential in the design and fabrication of hierarchical high-efficiency photocatalysts.",
