It is generally considered that the hydrogenation of CO2 is the critical bottleneck of the CO2 electroreduction. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 molecules over Indium-doped SnP3 catalyst were systematically studied. Through doping with indium (In) atom, the energy barrier of CO2 protonation is reduced and OCHO* species could easily be generated. This is mainly due to the p orbital of In exhibits strong hybridization with the p orbital of O, indicating that there is a strong interaction between OCHO* and In-doped SnP3 catalyst. As a result, In-doped SnP3 possesses high-efficiency and high-selectivity for converting CO2 into HCOOH with a low limiting potential of −0.17 V. Our findings will offer theoretical guidance to CO2 electroreduction. Graphical abstract Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that In-SnP3 catalyst possesses efficient catalytic ability for the CO2-to-HCOOH conversion. This work provides deep insights into the formation mechanism of HCOOH on p block metal doped SnP3 surface.

HCOOH, as an economical and feasible conversion product for electrochemical CO2 reduction, is widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical, rubber coagulants, textiles, leather and electroplating. More importantly, it can serve as a chemical storage medium of hydrogen due to its low cost, high capacity as well as easy transportation and storage [8–10]. However, the diversification of products from CO2 reduction makes it challenging to obtain the desired product. Therefore, selecting the suitable catalyst is essential to convert CO2 into valuable HCOOH. Hori et al. classified the traditional metals into four categories according to the reduction products [11], wherein the post-transition (p-block) metals with d 10 electronic configuration such as Cd, In, Sn, Hg, Tl, and Pb are typical HCOOH-producing catalysts [12–14]. In particular, tin-based catalysts are the most widely studied by virtue of their economy and environmentally-friendly characteristics. For instance, nitrogen-doped SnO2 crystal surfaces [15] and crystalline SnO2 nanosphere catalyst [16] could be beneficial for the production of HCOOH. Recently, monolayer SnP3 as novel two-dimensional materials is predicted by DFT calculations [17,18], moreover, it displays remarkable multifunctional properties in microelectronics, optoelectronics and lithium/sodium ion batteries due to its good stability and high carrier mobility [19,20]. However, it remains a scarcity of study on SnP3 towards its application in catalysis. Besides, many strategies have been employed to enhance the electrochemical performance such as doping heteroatom, introducing surface defects, transforming crystal facets and applying surface strain, etc. Among them, doping is a very effective means to regulate the electronic structures of electrocatalysts and enhance the catalytic effect of CO2 conversion [21–23]. For instance, Liu et al. found that pyrrolic-nitrogen doped graphene is a promising catalyst for converting CO2 into HCOOH by the first-principle calculation due to its ultralow overpotential of 0.24 V [24]. Sun and co-workers reported MoP nanoparticles supported on indium-doped porous carbon displayed a superior catalytic activity and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH [25], which is attributed to the suitable binding energy of key intermediates lowers the energy barrier for the potential-limiting step. Herein, we tailor the electronic structure of SnP3 via introducing a second row main-group metal Indium. This is not only due to the fact that it is a recognized HCOOH-producing metal but also that it is environmentally friendly compared to other typical HCOOH-producing metals. Therefore, it is deserved to systematically study the electrochemical performance of In-doped SnP3 as efficient catalyst in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via theoretical calculations. With the help of DFT, we calculated the electronic properties of SnP3 and Indium-doped SnP3 (denoted as In-SnP3), and the adsorption energy of intermediates on the catalyst surface. Mechanistic studies exhibit that doping of Indium narrows the bandgap due to the newly formed orbits at the Fermi level, which facilitates the charge transfer between OCHO* and In-SnP3, thus promoting the generation of OCHO* on the In-SnP3. In a word, In-SnP3 is more conducive to convert CO2 to HCOOH than SnP3. 2 Computational details 2.1 Methods All the geometric optimizations, electronic structures and single-point energies calculations were performed by means of spin-polarized DFT methods using Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code on the basis of the plane-wave pseudopotential [26–28]. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional for generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [29] and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method to account for the core-valence interactions were utilized, and the density functional dispersion correction (D3-Grimme) was used to accurately describe the weak interactions between small molecule and SnP3. The cutoff energy for plane-wave basis was set to 520 eV, The Brillouin zones were sampled with 1 × 1 × 1 Gamma center Monkhorst–Pack meshes for geometry optimizations [30], while a 3 × 3 × 1 k-points grid was implemented for electronic structure computations. The electronic relaxation was performed within an energy tolerance of 10−5 eV for self-consistency, while ionic optimizations were performed until all the residual forces were smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. Sn s 2 p 2, P s 2 p 3 and In s 2 p 1 electrons were treated as valence electrons. Spin-polarized wave functions were used for all calculations, which is crucial to properly represent the electronic structure of various adsorbed reaction intermediates. In addition, we have set a vacuum region of 20 Å between adjacent images to avoid the interaction along the z direction. The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for each elementary step was computed by exploiting the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model suggested by Nørskov et al. [31] . The ΔG was defined as follows: Δ G = Δ E + Δ E ZPE − T Δ S + Δ G U + Δ G pH , where the reaction energy ΔE can be directly obtained through analyzing the DFT total energies. ΔE ZPE is the change in zero-point energies, T is the system temperature (298.15 K) and ΔS is the difference in entropy. The zero-point energies and entropies of the CO2 adsorbed species were calculated by considering only the vibrational frequencies. Whereas, the frequencies and entropies of the free molecules(CO, CO2, HCOOH, H2) were derived from the NIST database [32]. ΔGU is the free energy contribution related to electrode potential U. ΔG pH = 2.303k B TpH represents the free energy contribution due to the variations in H concentration, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and the pH value was assumed to be zero for acidic medium. The limiting potential (UL) for the overall reaction depends on the most positive ΔG(ΔG max), which can be calculated as U L = −ΔG max/e. 2.2 Models Monolayer SnP3, a honeycomb-like six-membered ring structure with upper and lower folds composing of P and Sn atoms, is theoretically constructed by leaving only one layer from the optimized bulk structure. The optimized lattice constant of monolayer SnP3 is a = b = 7.17 Å, which is around 3% smaller than the bulk values according to experimental reports [33]. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) displays the optimized structure of monolayer SnP3 in the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell, which consists of 54 P atoms and 18 Sn atoms. In-SnP3 is established by substituting a Sn atom on the intact SnP3 surface with an Indium atom (Fig. 1c, d). In order to figure out the change in electronic properties of SnP3 caused by the indium doping, and to comprehend the effect of indium doping on CO2 reduction, we painted the band structure and density of states (DOS) of SnP3 and In-SnP3 (Fig. 2 ). The band structure of SnP3 is revealed in Fig. 2(a), and it is a semiconductor with bandgap of 0.44 eV, which is consistent with the theoretically reported value [20]. Meanwhile, the band structure of In-SnP3 was illustrated in Fig. 2(b), which demonstrates In-SnP3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with bandgap of 0.32 eV, and VBM and CBM fell at the G point simultaneously. Furthermore, the valence electrons taken away by Sn atom is more than the valence electrons introduced by Indium atom, hence In-SnP3 exhibits p-type semiconductor nature. It is worth mentioned that the solid dots on the orbit represent the weight of Indium atom, and the larger the point, the greater the contribution of indium to the orbit. It is evident that Indium atom has a great contribution in Fermi level. Fig. 2(c) illustrates the projected density of states (PDOS) of SnP3. Clearly, the valence band and the conduction band are mainly originated from P 3p orbits and Sn 5p orbits, and they exhibit a strong hybridization near the VBM and CBM indicating the formation of the stable P–Sn bond. Analyzing the PDOS of In-SnP3 (Fig. 2(d)), we can clearly observe that the orbit of Indium atom has the greatest contribution at the Fermi level, which is in line with the results presented by the band structure (Fig. 2(b)). In addition, the s and p orbitals of In hybridize with the p orbital of Sn and the p orbital of P at the Fermi level so that the new orbital appears at Fermi level, which is also the reason for the decrease of the band gap. In a word, the incorporation of Indium atom causes the valence band to move up, and the band gap value is significantly reduced, which facilitates the transfer of electrons and improves the catalytic activity. 3 Results and discussion After clarifying the geometry and electronic properties of the SnP3 and In-SnP3, we further analyzed their catalytic properties. The following reaction steps has been generally accepted for the reduction of CO2 to CO and HCOOH [34–36]. CO generation: * + C O 2 + H + + e − → COO H * COO H * + H + + e − → C O * + H 2 O C O * → CO + * HCOOH generation: * + C O 2 + H + + e − → COO H * / OCH O * COO H * / OCH O * + H + + e − → HCOO H * HCOO H * → HCOOH + * An efficient catalyst needs strong adsorption energy for COOH but weak adsorption energy for CO and HCOOH in terms of CO2 reduction, thereby ensuring it has the ability to stabilize COOH and release CO and HCOOH. Therefore, we next analyze the energy relationship of different intermediates. The Gibbs free energy change is schematically shown in Fig. 3 . In both reaction paths, the activation of CO2 is a transition from a linear molecule to a bent structure, and it is the initial step towards further reduction of CO2. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the conversion of CO2 into CO and HCOOH on SnP3. The protonation of O to form COOH* or the protonation of C to form OCHO* on the SnP3 catalyst is the most energetically difficult step in the entire reduction process, which is because the protonation process is endothermic and needs to absorb energy of 1.2 and 0.75 eV, respectively. Remarkably, the formation of COOH* and OCHO* is a rate-limiting step, therefore the negative electrode potential (−1.2 and −0.75 V) are applied for removing the energy barriers. Once the COOH* is formed, it will couple the second proton and electron to generate CO or HCOOH. Analyzing Fig. 3(a), we can find that the production and removal of CO* and HCOOH* are relatively easy, which is ascribed to the weak interaction CO and the SnP3 surface as well as HCOOH and SnP3 surface (as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d)). Fig. 3(c) and (d) reveals the reaction pathway of In-SnP3 for CO2 reduction to CO and HCOOH. The generation of the COOH* by way of CO2 activation is the potential-limiting step on In-SnP3 catalyst, which is due to the first proton coupled electron transfer step is uphill with higher onset potential of −0.76 V (Fig. 3(c)). On the contrary, the hydrogenation of the adsorbed CO2 species to OCHO* is energetically favorable on In-SnP3 with downhill free energy of −0.14 eV. Then the second proton-coupled electron occurs on the O atom to produce HCOOH*, which is the potential-limiting step with maximum positive ΔG of 0.17 eV for the consecutive pathway. The energy barrier is because the In-SnP3 catalyst has strong interaction with OCHO and weak interaction with HCOOH (Fig. 5(g)), thus leading to the formation of HCOOH* with a low onset potential of −0.17 V (Fig. 3(d)). In the following step, the desorption of HCOOH is also a non-spontaneous process and requires to adsorb energy of 0.08 eV. In summary, by analyzing the free energy values of different intermediates for CO2 reduction on the SnP3 and In-SnP3, we determine the thermodynamic limiting potential for each path and find CO2 HCOOH on the In-SnP3 is the kinetically most favorable reaction routes (the lowest-energy pathway). In addition, since the extraction of HCOOH is an endothermic process, it is necessary to explore whether HCOOH will further protonate to form multi-electron transfer products such as methane and methanol. Hence, we compared the energy barriers between HCOOH* desorption and the further hydrogenation of HCOOH*, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . The protonation of the C atom in the carbonyl group forming H2COOH* (0.53 eV) or CHO* and H2O (0.18 eV) are uphill processes, and their energy barriers are higher than those of the removal of HCOOH* (0.08 eV). Clearly, HCOOH* intermediates were more likely to desorb to form HCOOH product rather than further hydrogenation to the deep reduction products. In summary, the doping of Indiun atom lowers the energy barriers of the key intermediates COOH* and OCHO*. In particular, the spontaneously produced OCHO* has an ultra-low onset potential, which greatly enhances the catalytic performance for CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, In-SnP3 is a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction and leads exclusively to HCOOH as the product. In order to make clear the improvement of catalytic performance caused by doping Indium atom, we calculated the absorbed energy value and the charge density difference of various intermediate absorbed on SnP3 and In-SnP3 catalysts (as shown in Fig. 5 ). Our computations show that COOH* species adopts a monodentate end-on configuration on SnP3 and In-SnP3, and the corresponding adsorption energies are −1.44 and −1.97 eV, respectively, which further testifies that the formation of COOH* requires a higher energy barrier in SnP3 than In-SnP3 (Fig. 3(a) and (c)). Furthermore, this similar adsorption energy value for OCHO* on the SnP3 catalytic surface (−1.98 eV) and COOH* on the In-SnP3 catalyst surface (−1.97 eV) also meet their similar energy barrier values (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). Finally, special attention is paid to the pivotal Fig. 5(g). The OCHO* prefers to adopt a bidentate adsorption mode, forming two O-In bonds with the distance of 2.29 Å. The adsorption energy value is −2.28 eV, which is significantly higher compared to those of other intermediates, suggesting that there is a strong interaction between them, so CO2 is prone to protonate to form OCHO intermediates on the In-SnP3. The increase in catalytic activity caused by doping effect is mainly attributed to electronic properties. And therefore, the corresponding difference in charge density was also analyzed to confirm the as-mentioned above discussions. It is clear that the electron cloud shown in Fig. 5(g) is largest than that of the others, which represents a large amount of electron transfer and strong interaction between OCHO* and the catalyst surface, which is also verified by its negative adsorption energy value (−2.28 eV). The key intermediate COOH* and OCHO* have larger electron cloud on the surface of In-SnP3 (Fig. 5(e) and (g)) compared with SnP3 (Fig. 5(a) and (c)), which may be due to the asymmetric distribution of charge on the surface of the catalyst caused by the doping of Indium atom. Briefly, the doping of Indium atom enhances the adsorption between crucial products and the catalyst, which greatly reduces the catalytic energy barrier and enhances the catalytic activity. To gain a deep understanding of the electronic interaction between the adsorbate and catalysts, the PDOS of SnP3 and In-SnP3 (as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (d)) were analyzed. The main overlaps between 2p orbitals of C in the COOH* and the 5p orbitals of In in the In-SnP3 (Fig. 6(c)) is stronger and closer to the Fermi level than SnP3 catalyst, and this is also the reason for its relatively low energy barrier. It is worth noting that the PDOS of O and C are the contribution of two O atomic orbitals and one C atomic orbital, respectively. So the PDOS of O is denser than the PDOS of C. On the other hand, Fig. 6(d) indicates that In behaves the strongest hybridization with O in the adsorbed OCHO* species (between −0.2 and −3.8 eV), which greatly promote the formation of OCHO* on the In-SnP3 and further substantiate its excellent catalytic activity for converting CO2 to HCOOH. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have comprehensively studied the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of SnP3 and In-SnP3 by using spin-polarized DFT calculation combined with SHE models. Our results revealed that In-SnP3 catalyst possesses prominent catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction, especially HCOOH as the product with a considerably small onset potential of −0.17 V. The reduced band gap, the strong interaction between OCHO* species and In-SnP3 catalyst as well as the feasible HCOOH desorption are responsible for the high activity of the In-SnP3 catalyst. Our findings not only provide theoretical insights for CO2 reduction reaction, but also open a new avenue to further explore the potential monolayer two-dimensional material as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "It is generally considered that the hydrogenation of CO2 is the critical bottleneck of the CO2 electroreduction. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 molecules over Indium-doped SnP3 catalyst were systematically studied. Through doping with indium (In) atom, the energy barrier of CO2 protonation is reduced and OCHO* species could easily be generated. This is mainly due to the p orbital of In exhibits strong hybridization with the p orbital of O, indicating that there is a strong interaction between OCHO* and In-doped SnP3 catalyst. As a result, In-doped SnP3 possesses high-efficiency and high-selectivity for converting CO2 into HCOOH with a low limiting potential of −0.17 V. Our findings will offer theoretical guidance to CO2 electroreduction.",
