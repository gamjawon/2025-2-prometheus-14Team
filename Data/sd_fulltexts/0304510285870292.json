Addition of extra EtAlC^ as a co-catalyst is required for the formation of the catalytically active species necessary for olefin metathesis. Polymer-anchored ethyl- aluminum chloride or diethylaluminum seem to act as carriers of the active species for the olefin metathesis reaction. Introduction Some problems exist for the application of olefin metathesis to organic syntheses: (a) the active species and the catalyst components are sensitive to dioxygen or atmospheric moisture; (b) the lifetimes of the active species are relatively short as a result of site-site recombination; (c) the separation of the catalyst from the reaction products is difficult; and (d) contamination with the remaining catalyst causes the quality of the products to deteriorate. The use of a polymer as the carrier of the active species for olefin metathesis may be expected to provide at least a partial solution for these difficulties. The support of homogeneous catalytically active transition metal com- plexes on organic polymers has been the subject of much research activity [1]. Although some polymer-anchored olefin metathesis catalysts have already been reported [2-4], the catalyst prepared with polymer-anchored organoaluminum compounds has not yet been applied to olefin metathesis reactions. We now report the investigation of the olefin metathesis reaction of pent-2-ene or oct-2-ene in the presence of polymer-anchored catalysts, i.e. WCle/polymer-anchored ethylaluminum chloride or diethylaluminum, WCV polymer-anchored trimethyltin [2], or polymer-anchored tungsten hexa- chloride/EtAlClz [3]. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 210 Experimental All of the reactions and manipulations were carried out under nitrogen or in vacua. Commercial nitrogen of ultra-high purity (>99.999%) was used after passage through a column of 5A molecular sieves and a cold trap cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. Pent-2-ene was obtained by the dehydration of pentan-2-ol with sul- furic acid, dried with anhydrous sodium carbonate, passed through 5A molecular sieves, and then subjected to trap-to-trap distillation and treated with silica gel before use. Commercial ci's-oct-2-ene was stored over molec- ular sieves and treated with silica gel before use. Chlorobenzene was washed with concentrated sulfuric acid and water, dried over phosphorus pentoxide, distilled and stored over molecular sieves. Benzene, THF, cyclohexane and n-hexane were distilled from sodium benzo- phenone ketyl. WClg was purified through the removal of the more volatile oxytungsten chlorides in vacua at ca. 100 C, while EtAlCl; and Et3Al were distilled under atmospheric pressure. Commercial n-butyllithium in n-hexane was used as received. Tetra- methylethylenediamine (TMEDA) was refluxed over calcium hydride for 3 h and distilled. Trimethyltin chloride was purified by recrystallization from benzene. Analyses of the reaction products were achieved through the use of a Shimazu model GC-4b PTF or model GC-R1A gas chromatograph employ- ing a flame ionization detector. The gas chromatographic column measured 0.25 mm X 30 m and was coated with Apiezon grease L. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas, the column temperature being increased from 50 C to 140 C over 30 min. Crosslinked polystyrene (3% or 1%) was prepared by polymerization of a mixture of 15.0 g of styrene and 0.80 g or 0.30 g of divinylbenzene in the presence of 0.38 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) in 30 ml of water at 90 C, using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. The polymer was washed with water, dried and purified by removing ethanol- or benzene-soluble substances by Soxhiet extraction and drying the final product in vacua. Brominated polystyrene was prepared by the reaction of 5.0 g of polystyrene in 50 ml of refluxing chloroform with 2.0 g of bromine in 20 ml of chloroform in the presence of a trace of iron powder. The product was air-dried, and then refluxed in 20 ml of hydrobromic acid (ca. 47%) for 3 h. The product was washed with water and dried in vacua. The bromine content of the resulting products was determined by elemental analyses. The lithiated polystyrene was prepared via two routes: the reaction of n-butyllithium with brominated polystyrene in the presence of THF, or with polystyrene in the presence of TMEDA. Typical procedures were as follows: (1) In a Schlenk-type reactor, 0.2 g of brominated polystyrene (3% crosslinked; bromine content, 0.40 mg atom) was dried in vacua for 30 min, treated with 0.75 ml of n-butyllithium in hexane (1.58 M) in the presence of 2.0 of THF for 2 h, and washed with three 5 ml portions of benzene. The resulting polymer was black. 211 (2) In a Schlenk-type reactor, 0.10 g of polystyrene (3% cross-linked) was dried in vacua for 20 min, and 2.0 ml of cyclohexane and 0.21 ml TMEDA (1.40 mmol) added. After the addition of 0.88 ml of n-butyllithium (1.58 M) (1.40 mmol) in n-hexane, the mixture was kept at 65 C in an oil- bath for 20 h. The color of the resin changed from colorless to yellow and then to black. The resultant polymer was separated by filtration, washed six times with 20 ml aliquots of cyclohexane and the filtrate titrated with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (0.1 N) using a pH meter to determine the consumption of n-butyllithium. The resulting polymer was washed three times with 2 ml aliquots of THF. Metathesis of pent-2-ene or cis-oct-2-ene in the presence of WCl^/polymer- anchored ethylaluminum chloride and EtAlCl^ Polymer-anchored ethylaluminum chloride was obtained by treating the lithiated polystyrene prepared via route 1 described above with 1.1 ml of EtAlCl; solution (0.73 M) (0.80 mmol, Al/Br = 2:1), and washing the resin three times with 5 ml aliquots of benzene. After treating the resultant resin with WClg solution in chlorobenzene (0.025 M) (0.20 mmol, W/Br = 1:2), 1.1 ml of pent-2-ene (10.2 mmol, pent-2-ene/W = 50:1) was added and the mixture stirred for 10 min. The reaction mixture was separated by filtration and analyzed by GC (run 1). After stirring the resin with an addi- tional 0.3 ml of EtAlCl2 in chlorobenzene (0.73 M) (0.2 mmol) for 10 min, 1.1 ml of pent-2-ene (10.2 mmol, pent-2-ene/W = 50:1) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was separated from the resin by filtration and the filtrate analyzed by GC (run 2). After similar treatment of the resin with an additional 1.1 ml of pent-2-ene, the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC (run 3). The resin was treated with 0.3 ml of EtAlClz (0.73 M) (0.2 mmol) and 1.1 ml of pent-2-ene. After stirring for 1 h the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC (run 5).

The experimental procedure and the notation of the results are similar to those described in the former sections. The experimental results (runs 18 - 23) are summarized in Table 4. 214 Results and discussion Several olefin metathesis catalysts have already been reported [2-4]. Two synthetic approaches are available for the support of typical olefin metathesis catalysts such as WCls/EtAlCIa, WCle/EtaAl, or WCle/tetramethyl- tin or tetraphenyltin on an organic polymer: the fixation of a transition metal complex on the polymer [1,3,4], or the fixation of the organo- metallic co-catalyst on the polymer [2] (Scheme 1).

In this research, several polymer-anchored catalyst components, includ- ing polymer-anchored aluminum compounds, were synthesized and the metathesis reactions of pent-2-ene and c;s-oct-2-ene in the presence of these polymer-anchored catalysts, i.e. WCle/polymer -anchored ethylaluminum compounds, WCle/polymer-anchored trimethyltin and polymer-anchored tungsten pentachloride/EtAlCIs, investigated. The polymer-anchored catalyst components were synthesized via the routes shown in Scheme 2. - -Tonte-r ^D-Li -BAIC12- (py-Q-Aiaci (D^ ^ouun ^OK, -Et3A1 (pHO^Aia; (^B^ Q-routeT -a^Ll-Me3sna (p)^)\"SnMe3 <E>^ route lor 2 -^L' w16 (P>-^WCl5 Scheme 2. Because some of the reactants and products in Scheme 2 are sensitive to air and moisture, the polymer-anchored catalyst components were prepared via one-pot reactions. The lithiated polystyrene was prepared by means of two routes: the reaction of brominated polystyrene with n-butyllithium in 216 the presence of THF, or the reaction of polystyrene with n-butyllithium in the presence of TMEDA (the direct lithiation). The experimental results are summarized in Tables 1-4. As a catalyst, WCle/polymer-anchored ethylaluminum chloride displays quite unusual behavior: it is inactive for the metathesis of pent-2-ene and Ci's-oct-2-ene when the ratio (W/A1) of catalyst components (WClg and polymer-anchored ethylaluminum chloride) is 1/2 (runs 1 and 5), which corresponds to the optimum ratio when the homogeneous catalyst WC4/ EtAlCl2 is employed in the reaction. The addition of a 2 mol equivalent of EtAlC^, however, causes the metathesis of the two olefins (runs 2, 3, 6 and 7). The depression of the catalytic activity by treatment with new olefins is evident in runs 3 and 7, which apparently demonstrate a shorter lifetime for active centers on 3% crosslinked polystyrene compared with expectation. The regeneration of the catalytic activity by the addition of a 2 mol equiv- alent of EtAlCl2 is unexpected (runs 4 and 8). A similar trend was observed with WCl^/polymer-anchored diethyl- aluminum as the catalyst. Treatment of polymer-anchored diethylaluminum with a 0.5 mol equivalent of tungsten hexachloride resulted in a material which failed to catalyze the metathesis of pent-2-ene (runs 9 and 12). The catalytic activity was regenerated, however, by treatment with additional EtAlCl2. The activities of the catalysts studied appear to depend on their manner of preparation, i.e. from brominated polystyrene or from lithiated poly- styrene. The catalyst prepared from brominated polystyrene was more active than that prepared from lithiated polystyrene. This seems to indicate that the equilibrium position of reaction (2) in Scheme 3 lies further to the left possibly as a result of the greater stability of the phenyl anion in comparison to the ethyl anion. -@-Br Et3A'- -^-AIEt; EtBr (1) - -Li - t3 - -@-AlEt2 * EtLi (2) The behavior of WClg/polymer-anchored trimethyltin as a catalyst was similar to that of the polymer-anchored ethylaluminum compounds. Thus polymer-anchored trimethyltin was inactive for the metathesis of ci's-oct-2- ene when treated with a 0.5 mol equivalent of tungsten hexachloride (run 15), while the catalytic activity was regenerated on addition of a 2 mol equivalent of EtAlCl2 (runs 16 and 17). Polymer-anchored tungsten pentachloride/EtA!Cl2 behaved quite differently from the three former catalysts. This catalyst was active in the absence of additional EtAlCl2 (runs 18 and 21), although, as in the case of the three former catalysts, the catalytic activity was depressed by treatment with new olefins (runs 19, 20, 22 and 23). This seems to indicate that WCV 216 polymer-anchored organo-aluminum or -tin are quite different from polymer- anchored tungsten pentachloride/EtAlC^ as catalysts. A similar dependence of the catalytic activity on how the polystyrene was lithiated (either directly or indirectly) was observed with these catalysts, with the catalyst formed via route 2, i.e. the direct lithiation of polystyrene, being more active (runs 21 - 23) than that via route 1 (runs 18 - 20). The formation of inert catalysts for olefin metathesis by the reaction of WClg/polymer-anchored ethylaluminum or methyltin compounds, and the formation of active catalysts by the addition of EtAlCl;, seems to indicate that the polymer-anchored ethylaluminum or methyltin compounds pre- pared in this study act rot as co-catalysts but rather as carriers of the active species for the olefin metathesis reaction. The complexation of the active species of olefin metathesis to Lewis acids, such as aluminum chloride, via chlorine or alkylidene bridges is well- known [5]. Indirect fixation of catalytically active species onto polymer- anchored Lewis acids by such chlorine or alkylidene bridges is rare, the present WCle/polymer-anchored ethylaluminum compounds appearing to provide such an example.

Addition of extra EtAlCl2 as a co-catalyst is required for the formation of the catalytically active species necessary for olefin metathesis. Polymer-anchored ethylaluminum chloride or diethylaluminum seem to act as carriers of the active species for the olefin metathesis reaction.",
