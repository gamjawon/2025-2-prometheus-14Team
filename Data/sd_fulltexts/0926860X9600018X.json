Y zeolites with unit cell size in the range 24.21-24.60 A, were used as materials for fluid catalytic cracking. The matrix of the catalysts composed of kaoline filler and silica binder is quite inactive for VGO cracking. The intrinsic activity of the catalysts, defined as the rate constant of VGO cracking divided by the zeolite surface area, increases with increasing unit cell size and then decreases through a maximum and correlates directly with the number of 0-NNN aluminum atoms. This indicates that only 0-NNN aluminum atoms in the zeolite are the active sites responsible for VGO cracking. The increased coke yield with larger unit cell sizes can be attributed to the increased number of 1,2,3,4-NNN aluminum atoms. Keywords: Fluid catalytic cracking; Cracking; Zeolite; Unit cell size 1. Introduction The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is one of the major processes that contributes to the gasoline pool. Because of its durability and flexibility in processing a variety of feedstocks, FCC is an important upgrading process for oil refineries. Since 1964 almost all FCC catalysts have contained a kind of stable Y zeolite dispersed in an amorphous silica-alumina matrix or silica-clay * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are a function of the Si/A1 ratio of the zeolite, since this ratio controls the total number, density, and strength distribution of the active sites [2]. Breck and Flanigen found a propor- tional linear relationship between the unit cell size of faujasite type zeolites and the number of active sites (aluminum atoms) in the zeolites [3]. Numerous studies reporting the effect of the unit cell size of the zeolite on the product selectivity in gas oil cracking have been presented [2,4-8], but relatively few studies have investigated the relation between gas oil cracking activity and the unit cell size of the zeolite [2,9]. Pine et al. [2] reported that the cracking activity of FCC catalysts increased with the increase of the unit cell size of the zeolite merely because of the increase in the total number of acid sites in the zeolite. Rawlence et al. [10] also reported that higher steaming severity resulted in a lower equilibrium unit cell size and lower activity. The cracking activity of the zeolite correlates with the total number of acid sites in the zeolite; however, the acid strength of the active sites is still an important factor affecting the catalytic activity of the zeolite. In addition to cracking activity, coke selectivity is also important for FCC catalysts, because FCC units are operated with a heat balance between the reactor and the regenerator. The heat generated by coke burning is supplied for the endothermic cracking reaction. The coke selectivity of FCC catalysts is also affected by the unit cell size of the zeolite [4,6,8]. With the increase in the unit cell size, the coke formation is accelerated by the increased hydrogen transfer activity of the zeolite. In this work, the authors investigated the effect of the unit cell size on the activity and coke selectivity of steamed and calcined Y zeolites. The effect of the acid site distribution in the zeolite on the catalytic behavior is discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Three types of USY zeolites (TSZ-330HSA, TSZ-330HUA, TSZ-360HUA) supplied by Tosoh Corporation and an NHa-Y zeolite (LZY 62) supplied by Union Carbide Corporation were used as the raw materials of the catalysts. The silica-to-alumina ratios of each zeolite determined by chemical analyses and calculated from their unit cell size are listed in Table 1. Each zeolite was mixed with kaoline clay and stabilized silica sol (SI-550) supplied by Catalysts and Chemicals Industries Co. The obtained slurry was heated over a sand bath with continuous stirring. The dried product was crushed and sieved to the proper particle size (520-710 p~m). Though typical particle sizes of commercial FCC catalysts are in the range of 20 to 150 ~m, rather large catalyst particles were T. lno, S.

Each catalyst contains 30% zeolite, 50% kaoline clay, and 20% silica binder. The prepared catalysts were calcined in air at 600 for 2 h except the NH4-Y containing catalyst, which was calcined at 500 for 2 h. Some portions of the catalysts were treated with 100% steam at temperatures in the range from 600 to 810 for 6 h. The catalysts were designated by the type of zeolite, the treatment atmosphere, and the treatment temperature. The first letter of the catalyst name indicates the name of the zeolite and the second indicates the treatment atmosphere, i.e., S is steam and C is calcination. The following numerals indicate the treatment temperature expressed in degrees Celsius. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The unit cell size of the zeolites was determined by X-ray diffraction following ASTM D-3942-80. High purity silicon powder (99.999%) was used as the calibration standard. The crystallinity of the zeolites was defined as \"% XRD intensity/NaY\", that is described in ASTM D-3906-80. NaY (LZY 54) supplied by Union Carbide Corporation was used as the reference zeolite. The zeolite and matrix surface areas of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption at - 196. The distinction between micro- and meso-pores was made by applying the t-plot method to the measured isotherms. The authors attributed the micro-pore to zeolite and the meso-pore to matrix. The acid property of the catalyst was characterized by pyridine temperature programmed desorption (TPD). In all experiments, 50 mg of sample was charged into a tubular cell. Prior to obtaining TPD spectra, the sample was outgassed at 400 for 30 min in flowing helium and then cooled to 150. At that temperature, pyridine was adsorbed on the sample by injecting pulses of pyridine (2 pA/pulse). The injection of pyridine was repeated until the amount 8 7\". Ino, S. Al-Khattaf/Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 5-17 of pyridine detected was the same for the last two injections. After the adsorption of pyridine was saturated, the sample was flushed at 150 for one hour with helium to remove excess pyridine, and then the temperature was programmed at 30/min to 1000 in flowing helium at 30 ml/min. An FID detector was used to monitor the desorbed pyridine. 2.3. Catalyst evaluation The catalytic experiments were carried out on a micro-activity test (MAT) unit (fixed bed), which was designed according to the ASTM D-3907 method with minor modifications. The reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure and 520. For a given catalyst, the conversion was varied by changing the catalyst-to-oil ratio (C/O) in the range of 0.5-3.0. The C/O is defined as the amount of catalyst divided by the total amount of oil fed in a given time on stream and was varied by changing the weight of the catalyst while the total amount of oil fed and the time on stream were constant, i.e., one gram of the oil was charged to the reactor in 30 s. Thermal effects and changes in the bed volume were minimized by diluting the catalyst with kaoline particles sieved to 520-710 txm and by keeping the total weight of the catalyst bed at 3 g. The distribution of gaseous products was analyzed by gas chromatography. The boiling point range of the liquid products was determined by simulated distilla- tion gas chromatography. The carbonaceous deposit on the spent catalyst was measured with a carbon determinator (Leco CS244). The product mass balance was typically > 95%. The conversion of the feed oil was defined as the same as that of the ASTM D-3907. Hydrotreated Arabian light vacuum gas oil (VGO) was used as the feed for the MAT unit. Its properties are shown in Table 2.

Catalyst characterization The prepared catalysts were treated under various conditions and they were characterized according to the unit cell size of the zeolite, the surface area, and the acidity. All the data obtained by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and pyridine TPD are listed in Table 3. The zeolite surface area is also shown in addition to the total surface area. All of these parameters characterizing the catalysts decreased as the treating temperature increased. The treatment under steam atmosphere accelerated the damage to the catalysts. 3.2. Effect of unit cell size on the activity VGO cracking is known to obey second order kinetics. The second order conversion can be written as = Z/(1 - X) = ko(C/O)t, (1) where r is the second order conversion (-), X the conversion (-), k0 the rate constant (s-1) and t the reaction time (s). In this study, the reaction time was fixed at 30 s. Then, the rate constant can be found by plotting X/(1 - X) versus C/O as shown in Fig. 1. By thermal or hydrothermal treatment of catalysts, the dealumination of zeolite takes place accompanying the partial collapse of the zeolite, resulting in a decrease of the zeolite surface area. In order to cancel the effect of the zeolite surface area from the kinetics of VGO cracking, the authors defined the intrinsic activity of zeolite as k0 divided by the zeolite surface area (Eq. (2)), K = ko/Sz, (2) Table 3 Characterization of catalysts Catalyst Treatment Unit cell Surface area (mz/g) Acidity Zeolite crystallinity size (,~) total zeolite (mmol/g) (% XRD intensity/NaY) AC600 calcination, 600 24.264 201 143 0.044 102.5 AS810 steaming, 810 24.239 163 116 0.019 85.0 BC600 calcination, 600 24.363 179 145 0.112 103.1 BS710 steaming, 710 24.281 171 131 0.047 93.7 BS760 steaming, 760 24.244 155 121 0.029 88.3 BS810 steaming, 810 24.224 137 96 0.020 72.1 CC600 calcination, 600 24.401 177 128 0.121 95.4 CS600 steaming, 600 24.317 155 122 0.087 92.7 CS810 steaming, 810 24.206 125 76 0.019 67.5 EC500 calcination, 500 24.577 154 118 0.239 89.4 10 T. lno, S.

The rate constant (ko) and the intrinsic activity of zeolite (K) for each catalyst are listed in Table 4. The effect of the unit cell size on the intrinsic activity of the zeolite is shown clearly by plotting K versus unit cell size (Fig. 2). The intrinsic activity K initially increases with the increased unit cell size; however, it reaches a maximum value at 24.36 A and then it decreases as the unit cell size increases. The unit cell size of zeolite is one of the most important factors affecting the activity and selectivity of FCC catalysts. In general, the cracking activity of FCC catalyst decreases as the unit cell size of the zeolite decreases because of the decrease in the number of acid sites in the zeolite [10]. In this study, the activity of steamed catalysts also showed similar behavior relative to the unit cell size. But the activity of the calcined catalysts showed a quite different trend from the steamed catalysts relative to the unit cell size. It is well known that the acid sites of zeolites correspond to the framework Table 4 The kinetic rate constant and the intrinsic activity Catalyst Rate constant (s- i ) Intrinsic activity (g s- I m- 2) AC600 0.0543 0.000380 AS810 0.0233 0.000201 BC600 0.0987 0.000680 BS710 0.04 10 0.000313 BS760 0.0297 0.000245 BS810 0.0270 0.000281 CC600 0.0737 0.000576 CS600 0.0693 0.000568 CS810 0.0263 0.000346 EC500 0.0500 0.000424 T. lno, S.

The effect of the unit cell size on the intrinsic activity ( K ). 24.6 aluminum atoms in the zeolites. From XRD studies of a number of faujasite type zeolites by Breck and Flanigen, the number of framework aluminum atoms in the unit cell of the zeolite is known to increase linearly as the zeolite unit cell size increases [3]. The authors also found a linear relationship between the acidity of the zeolite measured by pyridine TPD and the number of aluminum atoms per unit cell, as shown in Fig. 3. From these results, the decrease in the activity of the calcined catalysts accompanying the increase in the unit cell size cannot be explained by the amount of the acid sites. In order to study the relationship between the unit cell size of the zeolite and its catalytic properties, three important factors should be considered, i.e., the total number of acid sites, the ratio of B65nsted acid to Lewis acid, and the acid 0.24 0.20 ~ 0.16 Q E E o.12 0.08 <~ O.Ot+ 0 ilOi i 210 i 30L i 401 J Number of AI Atoms/Unit Ceil Fig. 3.

The distribution of 0-NNN aluminum atoms with the unit cell size. strength distribution of each type of site. Both BriSnsted and Lewis type acid sites are present in the Y zeolite used in FCC catalysts [11-13]. BriSnsted acidity is due primarily to acidic hydroxyl groups attached to the framework, while Lewis acidity is attributed mostly to nonframework aluminum species [14]. The concept of \"next nearest neighbors\" (NNN) provides a reasonable estimate of the acidic property of the zeolite [2,15]. The number of NNN can vary from zero to nine theoretically. In Y zeolites, however, the amount of aluminum atoms larger than 5-NNN is negligible [2]. The strength of the acid sites increases with the decrease in the number of NNN. Thus the isolated framework aluminum atoms (0-NNN) have the strongest acidity [2,16,17]. As the unit cell size of the zeolite decreases, the fraction of 0-NNN aluminum atoms among the total aluminum atoms increases, while the fraction of higher numbers of NNN decreases [2,17]. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of 0-NNN aluminum atoms in the unit cell of the zeolite as a function of the unit cell size. The maximum in 0-NNN aluminum atoms/unit cell was found to be around 24.36 A of the unit cell size. This distribution of 0-NNN aluminum atoms is quite similar to the variation in the catalytic activity shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, 0-NNN aluminum atoms, which correspond to the strongest acid sites, can be considered to be the site most responsible for VGO cracking. Fig. 5 shows pyridine TPD chromatograms of BC600 (maximum activity) and EC500 (maximum acidity). The tail end of the chromatogram of BC600 shifted to a higher temperature. This means that BC600 contains stronger acid T. Ino, S.

Fig. 6 shows the variation in the specific activity relative to the unit cell size of the zeolite. The total acidity was measured with pyridine TPD. The specific activity decreases significantly with increased unit cell size; this behavior is similar to the variation in the fraction of 0-NNN aluminum atoms relative to the unit cell size, which is also shown in Fig. 6. This indicates that the cracking activity of the catalysts depends only on the number of 0-NNN aluminum atoms contained in the catalysts. It has been reported that the new strong acid, or \"super acid\", sites are generated by the interaction of framework Br~insted sites and the Lewis sites associated with nonframework aluminum [18-20]. Since dealumination is accel- erated by increasing the steaming severity, the zeolites with lower unit cell size contain more nonframework aluminum atoms. In this study, however, no effect of the nonframework aluminum on boosting the cracking activity was observed. 10 6 3: -= 4 0 0 / i / 0I ,f // // o yoO/ / o// I I I I I I 1 2 3 ~ 5 6 ( Cony.

Coke selectivity 15 Coke is an important product in the FCC unit because coke burning in the regenerator provides the heat required to maintain the heat balance of the unit. On the other hand, excess coke formation leads to the loss of valuable liquid products and the restriction of stable operations. The coke formed in the FCC unit can be divided into four types based on its origins: catalytic coke, cat-to-oil coke, contaminant coke, and carbon residue coke [21,22]. In resid cracking, contaminant coke and residue coke are major contributors to the overall coke formation. In conventional VGO cracking, however, catalytic and cat-to-oil coke contribute predominantly. Furthermore, only catalytic coke is responsible for the coke formed in VGO MAT measure- ments, since the stripping time of MAT is long enough to remove oil caught in the catalyst pores. Taking the role of coke in the FCC unit conversion into consideration, Mott [23] introduced the concept of \"dynamic activity\". A plot of second order conversion versus coke yield gives a straight line whose slope and intercept represent the dynamic activity and the carbon residue in the feed oil. In VGO cracking, this straight line goes to the origin. The authors defined intrinsic coke selectivity as the reciprocal of dynamic activity, i.e., the slope of the line obtained by plotting coke yield against second order conversion. A typical example of this plot is shown in Fig. 7. The intrinsic coke selectivity is reflected in the nature of the FCC catalyst, since it is not affected by conversion at the .R o o ~ o 3 1.0 ~1/ //// /// O // (9(9 -.e-Cock Selectivity 7t/ --- Froction o f 1,2,3, 4,- NNN / AI atoms / / // I I I o o.e z z o.6 z i (',,I 0.4---- 0.2 LI_ 0.0 24.2 2t,.3 24.1, 2t,.S 2k.6 Unit Ceil Size (A) Fig. 8.

Al-Khattaf /Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 5-17 same reaction temperature. An inactive clay matrix was used for all catalysts tested in this study. Thus the intrinsic coke selectivity is a function only of the nature of the zeolite. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the unit cell size of the zeolite on the intrinsic coke selectivity. The coke-making tendency increases with increased unit cell size as mentioned in previous papers [4,6,8]. One of the most likely routes of the catalytic coke is the dehydrogenation of the polyaromatic coke precursor by the hydrogen transfer reaction. It is generally recognized that the hydrogen transfer reaction is accelerated by increasing the unit cell size of the zeolite, because paired aluminum atoms are required for the hydrogen transfer reaction. The paired aluminum atoms correspond to 1,2,3,4-NNN aluminum atoms. As shown in Fig. 8, the fraction of 1,2,3,4-NNN aluminum atoms among the total framework aluminum atoms also increases in the same manner as the intrinsic coke selectivity with the unit cell size. This explains the strong relationship between coke selectivity and 1,2,3,4-NNN active sites. 4. Conclusions The effect of the unit cell size of faujasite zeolites on the catalytic activity and the coke selectivity for VGO cracking has been investigated. The catalytic activity depends primarily on the number of 0-NNN aluminum atoms (strongest acid sites) in the catalyst. The coke selectivity defined as (coke yield)/(kinetic conversion), which is independent of the degree of conversion, corresponds to the fraction of 1,2,3,4-NNN aluminum atoms among the total framework aluminum atoms in the zeolite. This indicates that the active sites with paired aluminum atoms are responsible for coke formation.

The effect of the unit cell size of Y zeolites on their cracking performance has been investigated by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and VGO cracking reaction using a micro-activity test unit. Y zeolites with unit cell size in the range 24.21–24.60Åwere used as materials for fluid catalytic cracking. The matrix of the catalysts composed of kaoline filler and silica binder is quite inactive for VGO cracking. The intrinsic activity of the catalysts, defined as the rate constant of VGO cracking divided by the zeolite surface area, increases with increasing unit cell size and then decreases through a maximum and correlates directly with the number of 0-NNN aluminum atoms. This indicates that only 0-NNN aluminum atoms in the zeolite are the active sites responsible for VGO cracking. The increased coke yield with larger unit cell sizes can be attributed to the increased number of 1,2,3,4-NNN aluminum atoms.
