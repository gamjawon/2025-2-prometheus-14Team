The complexes bearing a Si(OEt)3 group were heterogenised to a modified USY-zeolite by covalent bonding. All catalysts, homogeneous and heterogenised, are active and regioselective in the epoxidation of allylic alcohols at room temperature using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as terminal oxidant. The catalytic activity of the heterogenised complexes is generally comparable with the corresponding homogeneous ones, yielding epoxyalcohols with excellent yields and selectivity and moderate enantioselectivity. Life time of heterogenised catalysts has been examined by repeated use of the complexes leading similar rates and yields of epoxide, whilst no appreciable loss of metal has been observed over several runs. 1. Introduction The transition metal-catalysed epoxidation of alkenes using alkyl hydroperoxides as the oxy- gen source has been extensively employed in the last two decades in both laboratory and industrial processes [1]. In the laboratory Sharp- less and Verhoeven have made extensive studies of regio- and stereoselective alkene epoxida- tions using molybdenum and vanadium-based complexes as catalysts [2], and enantioselective epoxidations of allylic alcohols with t-butyl hy- droperoxide (TBHP) activated by a titanium-di- * Fax: 34-1-5644853; e-mail: felix-iqo@pinarl.csic.es alkyl tartrate (Katsuki-Sharpless reagent) [3]. The most important industrial application is the oxidation of propene: the Halcon or Arco pro- cess using homogeneous Mo(VI) [4] or hetero- geneous Ti-silica [5] catalysts. Research on readily recoverable and recy- clable supported heterogenised catalysts for ox- idative processes has grown steadily in recent years. The majority of these has been based upon polymer supports (specially porous polystyrene resins) [6], and has displayed favourable activity and selectivity, but in terms of recycling, has been disappointingly unstable and often showing excessive metal leaching. These main disadvantages could be overcome by heterogenising the complexes on a high sur- 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Corma et aL /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 225-234 face supports (silica or zeolite) [7], which stabi- lize the Mo-species and the organometallic compound remains strongly bonded to support during reaction course. Heterogenised homoge- neous catalysts combine the properties of the homogeneous ones, as reactivity, controllability and selectivity, and the heterogeneous ones, as enhanced stability and reusability [8]. In a previ- ous paper we reported on the synthesis, reac- tions and catalytic applications of some zeolite- anchored Mo-complexes for epoxidating simple alkenes [9]; the use of zeolite-supported Mo- complexes in oxygen transfer reactions involv- ing TBHP in comparison with the correspond- ing homogeneous reactions were made. In this paper we describe the selective syn- thesis, as pure enantiomers, and characterisation of chiral MoO2(acac)L where L are bidentate O,O-ligands derived from (L)-trans-4-hydroxy- proline. Those compounds bearing an Si(OEt)3 group were heterogenised by anchoring into modified USY-zeolites. The application of these novel heterogeneous catalysts for the selective epoxidation of allylic alcohols was tested. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Molybdenyl acetylacetonate (MoO2(acac)2) (Aldrich Chemical) was used as supplied. All solvents were carefully degassed prior to use. The silylating agent OCN(CH2)3Si(OEt)3 ob- tained from Fluka (96%) was distilled before use. An anhydrous solution of TBHP in CH2C12 recently prepared from aqueous TBHP-70 ac- cording to a literature method was employed [21. All preparations of Mo-complexes were car- ded out under dinitrogen by standard Schlenk techniques. C, H and N analyses were carried out by the analytical department of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Institute of Materials Science (C.S.I.C.) with a Heraeus and a Perkin-Elmer 240C apparatus, respectively. Metal contents were determined by atomic ab- sorption in a Unicam (SP9) Philips apparatus. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Nicolet XR60 spectrophotometer (range 4000-200 cm-l). IH- and ~3C-NMR spectra were taken on Varian XR300 and Bruker 200 spectrome- ters; chemical shifts are given in ppm with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Optical rotation values were measured with a Perkin Elmer 241 MC polarimeter. The inorganic support taken as model is an ultrastable Y zeolite (USY) prepared by steam calcination at 1023 K from a partly (80%) am- monium exchanged NaY (SK40 Union Carbide), followed by treatment with a 1 N citric acid solution at 333 K for 30 min for removing extraframework species. After this, the zeolite was thoroughly washed and dried at 403 K for 6 h. The final zeolite contained, besides the typi- cal ca. 12 .~ micropores, a well developed supermicropore-mesopore system (pore diame- ter 12-30 A). The controlled dealumination promotes destruction of some sodalite units, which allowed direct communication between a-cages generating cavities wider than 12 ,~. The formation of supermicropores and large mesopores has been detected by N2 adsorption-desorption. The main characteristics of the resultant zeolite are: unit cell size, 24.40 o A; bulk SiO2/A1203, 4.2; crystallinity, > 95%. The inorganic support was dried at 415 K under 0.01 torr before the anchoring process. 2.2. Preparation of the ligands 2.2.1. Methyl (S)-N-benzyl-4-oxopyrrolidine-2- carboxylate (1) To a solution of oxalyl chloride (1.4 g, 11 mmol) in methylene chloride (25 ml) cooled at -60, dimethyl sulphoxide (1.7 g, 22 mmol) in methylene chloride (5 ml) was added during 2 min, then a 2-ml solution of methyl (2S,4R)- N-benzyl-trans-4-hidroxypyrrolidine-2-carbox- ylate (2.35 g, 9.43 mmol). After stirring for 1 h at -60, triethylamine (7 ml, 50 mmol) was added and then allowed to warm up to room A.

General procedure A solution of the corresponding ligand 2-7 (0.43 mmol) in methylene chloride or cyclohex- ane (10-15 ml) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of MoO2(acac)2 (139 mg, 0.43 mmol) in the same solvent 50 ml in Schlenk type flask under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1-5 h at r.t. (CH2C12, ligands 2, 6a, 6b) or 70 (cyclohexane, ligands 3, 7a, 7b). The solid crude complex was filtered, washed with ethyl ether or hexane. Characteri- sation of the different complexes has been car- ried out by elemental analysis of C, H, N, atomic absorption of Mo, and 1H-NMR and IR spectra.

Preparation of zeolite heterogenised molyb- denum complexes A molybdenum-complex bearing a tri- ethoxysilyl group (0.2 mmol), described above, in dry dichloromethane (2 ml) was added to a suspension of the inorganic support (modified USY-zeolite dried at 140 for 3-4 h' in vacuo') (1 g) in dry toluene (40 ml) (Scheme 1). The mixture was stirred, under argon, for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the solid was filtered and Soxhlet-extracted with CH2C12/ethyl ether (1:1) for 7 h to remove the remaining non-sup- ported complex. The pale solid was dried in vacuo. The structure of the supported complex was deduced from analytical and spectroscopic data. The co-ordination sphere around the metal is the same for the unsupported complexes un- der these reaction conditions. The analytical data were presented in Table 3. 2.5. Catalytic epoxidation of allylic alcohols A typical procedure for the epoxidation of allylic alcohols is as follows: into a 25-ml round-bottomed flask catalyst (0.0048 mmol), CH2C12 (2.5 ml), alkene (1 mmol) was placed and TBHP solution (1.5 mmol anhydrous solu- tion in CH2C12) was added dropwise, this point being taken as the starting of the reaction. Sam- ples were periodically withdrawn by syringe during the reaction period and monitored by GLC on a permethyl-/3-cyclodextrine/OV-701 (15/85) capillary column by comparison with authentic samples. The results obtained are summarised in Table 4. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Synthesis of ligands and catalysts The chiral dihydroxy ligands were prepared from methyl (2S,4R)-N-benzyl-4-oxopyrroli- dine-2-carboxylate [9]. The attack to the 4-keto group can be done highly selective by tuning the temperature and nature of organometallic reagent, yielding almost exclusively the enan- tiomerically pure (2S,4R) or (2S,4S)-proline derivatives 2, 3 depending of the conditions given (Scheme 1). The introduction of N-carbamoyl substituents containing a t-butyl group, useful for working in solution, or a triethoxysilyl group, adequate for anchoring on zeolite, was performed by treatment of free amine with the selected alkylisocyanate at room temperature in quantita- tive yields. In preparation of ureas 6b and 7b, bearing a triethoxysilyl group, no products from hydrolysis of Si-OEt bonds in the reaction me- dia could be detected. The molybdenum complexes were prepared by using a ligand exchange procedure, in which .o ?.

The resulting complex were isolated by crystallization in ex- cellent yields. In all cases the IR spectra con- tained two bands assigned to Mo=O stretching modes in the region 950-900 cm-~ as well as bands which belong to acetylacetonate group and the corresponding chiral ligand. The struc- ture of the products were determined by spec- troscopic methods and elemental analysis (C, H, N, Mo) (Scheme 2). The complexes bearing the Si(OEt)3 were bonded covalently to the free silanols in the support (USY-zeolite) at room temperature by controlled hydrolysis of ethoxysilyl group and posterior reaction with superficial silanols. The successful synthesis of the supported catalysts is confirmed by the analytical data of C, H, N and atomic adsorption of molybdenum with good loading ~ 1% (more than adequate for catalytic applications) were achieved. In all cases the IR spectra show bands at 940 and 910 cm-~ as- signed to two cis-Mo=O stretching modes, in- dicating the presence of oxo-molybdenum cen- (a) 100 80 o ~ 60 o 40 20 (b) 100 II , .............................................. :_ /~/~\" O 9b ~'P [] Zeol-9c 0 1 2 3 4 t (h) /:/ / ~' / .. 1.7.~ ~. ........... ..................... m ........................................... > / ={.-. /-.--m \" 0~ rn/ ....... .:./-.-II .... ~ 40 mc .,/~/ 'ij \"8b ] .,' Zeol-8c I I 20 * 9a I Z o 9b I [] Zeol-gc I 0 ~ , I ....

Epoxidation of allylic alcohols The soluble and heterogenised Mo-com- plexes were tested for the epoxidation of (E)- and (Z)-3,7-dim ethyl-2,6-octadien- 1 -ol (geraniol and nerol, respectively), which were used as models, with TBHP as oxygen source at room temperature, 0 and -20 in anhy- drous conditions. The results of epoxidation of allylic alcohols are summarised in Table 4. Even though for test reactions we have only used 0.5% of molar ratio catalysts/substrate the conversion of allylic alcohols is generally high. The selectivity of the reaction toward the forma- tion of 2,3-epoxialcohols obtained with homo- geneous and zeolite-supported catalysts was al- most complete (up to 99%) with both types of catalysts. The time-course plots of the epoxida- tion of geraniol and nerol catalysed by homoge- neous and heterogenised Mo-complexes are shown in Fig. 1. The results obtained for hetero- genised catalysts are generally comparable with the corresponding soluble molybdenum com- plexes which show a similar pattern indicating that both reactions take place through the same mechanism, without any significant change in the reaction pathway. The lifetimes of the zeolite catalysts were examined by their repeated use in the epoxida- tion of geraniol. The amount of metal ion was determined for each run. Approximately more than 95% of the metal was still retained on the zeolite-complex after five runs. The yield of epoxide decreased only slightly (more than 90% remained) and notable change in selectivity has not been observed. The major advantages of zeolite-anchored catalysts over their homogeneous counterparts are the ease of the recovering and recycling of the catalysts and the easier workup procedure, that permits removing catalysts (metal and chi- ral inductor) from reaction media through a simple filtration. Our catalysts systems have relatively long lifetime as catalytic activities after five runs are essentially the same as those of the first run. The enhanced stability of the present complexes may be attributed to the stronger co-ordination of the dihydroxyligand to Mo than that of the acetylacetonate or hydroxyl group present on the substrate, t-butylalcohol or hydroperoxide, and by dispersion the molecules of catalysts on the mesopores that avoid the dimerization and polymerization of Mo species. As it has been claimed earlier for the homo- geneous catalysts systems, the high regioselec- tivity achieved in the epoxidation of allylic alcohols can be interpreted by a mechanism in which simultaneous co-ordination of the hy- droxyl groups of the substrate and t-BuOOH to the metal ion at neighboring position is involved in the key intermediate. The fixed geometry of the allylic alcohols by the formation of such temary complex results in preferential transfer of oxygen to an olefinic site close to the hy- droxyl group. This may be supported by the observation that the rate of epoxidation is re- tarded in the presence of a large amount of t-BuOOH which could compete with the sub- strate for the co-ordination to the active center. The enantioselectivity of the reactions are low, except for catalyst 9b and its correspond- ing supported Zeol-9c. In these catalysts the enantioselectivity increased significantly when moving from homogeneous to heterogenised catalysts, which suggests an important role for the steric constraints of the support. These con- straints determine that both ternary diastereoiso- meric key intermediates (organometallic com- plex + substrate + hydroperoxide) must be ac- commodated differently in the confined spaces of mesopores, where the metal complexes are anchored, and as a consequence, induce a pref- erential transfer of oxygen to the pro-S face of the olefinic bond. The high activity and selectivity and the sig- nificantly easier workup indicate that this type of catalysts is a truly heterogeneous counterpart of homogeneous transition metal complex cata- 234 A.

Addi- tional efforts are being done for designing and preparing new chiral ligands in order to increase the enantioselectivity.

Life time of heterogenised catalysts has been examined by repeated use of the complexes leading similar rates and yields of epoxide, whilst no appreaciable loss of metal has been observed over several runs.",
