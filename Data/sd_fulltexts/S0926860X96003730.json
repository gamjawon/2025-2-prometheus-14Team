The material is then dried and calcined (in this work, for 5 h at 610). The sulfur content of the calcined material increases with the increase in the quantity of sulfuric acid, but the ratio of sulfate retained after calcination to sulfate impregnated decreases at first and then increases. The surface area gradually increases with the quantity of the acid up to 3 ml of acid per gram of zirconium hydroxide (2.5% S in SZ after calcination), then decreases abruptly. The crystal structure of the sulfated zirconia is also affected by the sulfur content. XRD data show that the sulfated zirconia with a low or medium sulfur content crystallizes only in the tetragonal form, whereas at higher sulfur content a minor fraction of monoclinic zirconia begins to be seen, in addition to the major tetragonal form. XPS data indicate that at the higher sulfate loading part of the sulfate is present in the bulk phase, rather than on the surface. Thus, the increase in sulfur uptake, decrease in surface area and change in crystallinity appear related to sulfate migration inside the particles. The catalytic activity for the isomerization of methylcyclopentane at 65 shows a maximum for a sulfur content around 3%. It appears that the optimum catalyst should contain the maximum amount of sulfate near the surface, but not necessarily on the surface, and crystallize in the tetragonal form. * Corresponding author.

Introduction Since the first report of the invention of sulfated zirconia catalysts and their activity in paraffin isomerization and alkylation by Holm and Bailey in 1962 [1] (a report almost generally overlooked in subsequent publications), the synthesis of this and similar materials (sulfated metal oxides, SMO) was based on filtration of an excess of dilute sulfuric acid through a bed of zirconium hydroxide or submersion of the same precursor under dilute sulfuric acid followed by removal of the excess acid, drying, and calcination [2-6]. We noticed, however, that application of this method gave in different laboratories materials with different compositions and properties, even though the same preparation procedure was reported; thus, treatment of zirconium hydroxide with 1 N H2SO4, filtration, and calcination at 600 for three hours gave materials with widely different sulfur contents: 4.0% [7], 2.7% [8], 1.5% [9], and even 0.85% [10]. We then developed a procedure in which the sulfur (sulfate) content of the catalyst can be controlled and the reproducibility is assured. The procedure was first used for the preparation of a sulfated alumina catalyst for methylation of phenol with methanol. The goal was to increase the selectivity for oxygen methylation, which was achieved at the cost of a reduction in the overall catalytic activity following sulfation [ 11 ]. The variation of the sulfate loading was not pursued in our early work. Later, we applied the procedure for the synthesis of a sulfated metal oxide of higher activity, namely sulfated zirconia [12]. For the limited range of sulfate loading investigated in our first study of sulfated zirconia, it appeared that surface area and catalytic activity increased with the sulfur content of the solid. We report here the results of a more extensive study of the effects of the amount of sulfuric acid impregnated onto Zr(OH)4 on the quantity of sulfur (sulfate) retained after calcination, surface area, crystal structure, and catalytic activity in the liquid phase isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts The sulfated zirconia catalysts were prepared by the controlled impregnation method, from zirconium hydroxide, as described previously by FSxcasiu et al. (SZCH) [ 12]. For the larger amounts of acid (>2 ml solution per gram of Zr(OH)4), evaporation through the bed of catalyst and along the walls results in a non-uniform D. Fgtrca~iu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 173-184 175 distribution of sulfate. To assure uniformity, the evaporation of water was con- ducted in a rotary evaporator at atmospheric pressure. The duration of evaporation can be varied by varying the depth of immersion of the flask in the oil bath (bath temperature 150). An evaporation time of 90 min was selected as the standard procedure, but no difference was observed between the properties of materials obtained with evaporation times of 40 min and 90 min. Drying of the moist cake was then continued in an oven at 150 for 15 h. The catalysts were then calcined for 5 h at 610, because it was found that for a catalyst obtained with 0.95 ml acid per gram of Zr(OH)4 and calcined at 610 gave a more active catalyst than calcination at 580 used in the previous paper [12]. A complete optimization of the calcination temperature was, however, not undertaken. 2.2. Characterization of sulfated zirconia All the catalysts in this study were characterized by sulfur content and specific surface area, as described previously [12]. Selected materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2.2.1. Crystallinity Crystallinity of the catalysts was determined by the XRD method, with a Phillips X' Pert X-ray diffractometer, using Cu-Ka radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA, at angles 20 from 20 to 60 scanned at a rate of 2min. 2.2.2. Thermal stability Thermal Stability of the catalysts was examined with a Hi-Res 2950 thermo- gravimetric analyzer, heated from 298 K to 973 K at a rate of 15 K/min, with a nitrogen gas flow of 20 ml/min. It was found that calcined materials are thermally stable up to the temperature used earlier for their calcination. 2.2.3. XPS Samples were prepared for photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on vacuum compatible, double-sided adhesive. The data were collected on a Physical Elec- tronics 5600 hemispherical analyzer at 23.5 eV pass energy and 0.050 eV steps. Due to sample charging for these insulating materials, the energy calibration for both the Zr and S regions was achieved by fixing the residual carbon (Is) signal from each sample to 285.0 eV. A non-monochromatic AI anode was used for this analysis, which led to a significant spectral overlap in the S(2p) region of the Ka3,4 induced Zr(3d). As a result of this interference, quantitation of the sulfate species was achieved from the peak heights measured at 170.0 eV per sample. The values reported represent the relative sulfate concentration at a fixed zirconia concentration. A peak at 160 eV, of intensity too low to be measured, could be due to sulfide. 176 D.

Composition and properties of the catalysts The sulfur content and specific surface area of the catalysts prepared are presented in Table 1, together with their catalytic activities, evaluated in the isomerization of methylcyclopentane (MCP) to cyclohexane at 65. 3.1.1. Effect of quantity of sulfuric acid on sulfur contents of the sulfated zirconia The sulfur content of the catalysts is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of the quantity of sulfuric acid used for impregnation. It can be seen that the sulfur content of the sulfated zirconia increases with an increase of the quantity of sulfuric acid solution used in the impregnation; the catalysts dried in the rotary evaporator exhibit a somewhat higher sulfur content than those dried in the dish when the same quantity of sulfuric acid is used in the impregnation. The difference increases with the increase of the amount of acid added. The amount of sulfur retained is smaller than the amount impregnated as sulfuric acid. The ratio (sulfur added)/(sulfur retained) increases with the amount of sulfuric acid added, up to ca. 3 ml per gram of Zr(OH)4, then decreases, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. This result is an indication that at high sulfate loading the sulfate moves into the bulk phase of the solid. It is also seen that more sulfate is retained in the materials dried in a rotary evaporator than in a dish; the difference increases with the amount of sulfuric acid added (Fig. 2).

Two approaches were previously used for varying the sulfate loading in the percolation method. The first, use of different concentrations of sulfuric acid, appears irreproducible, as discussed in the introduction of this paper [7-10]. In a study of sulfated iron oxide it was found that pre-treatment of iron hydroxide before sulfation has more effect on sulfate retention after impregnation and calcination than the concentration of sulfuric acid used [13]. In one example, more sulfate was retained after impregnation with 0.5N H2SO4 (1.37% S) than with 1 N H2SO4 (0.93% S) [13]. The second approach, variation of the calcination temperature, obviously affects the crystallinity as well [7,14]. Sulfate loading control by changing the pre-calcination of the metal hydroxide before impregna- tion should have the same consequence [13]. Thus, none of these approaches compare favorably with the procedure reported here. 3.1.2. Effect of the amount of sulfuric acid on the specific surface area Fig. 3 shows that the specific surface area of the sulfated zirconia first increases with the increase of the quantity of sulfuric acid solution, then decreases when the amount of sulfuric acid solution added is greater than 3 ml per gram of zirconium hydroxide. A previous report indicated no clear correlation between sulfur content and specific surface area, but the catalysts compared in that study had been calcined at different temperatures [7]. It has been known that surface area is a function of the calcination temperature [15-17]. In another study, materials prepared by soaking in acid of varying concentration followed by 178 D.

A large decrease in surface area was observed when the sulfur content was 7.2% (21.6% sulfate) [14]. The abrupt decrease in surface area for higher sulfur contents observed by us (Table 1) correlates with the alteration of crystal structure and sulfate migration into the bulk phase of the solid as discussed below. 3.1.3. Effect of sulfuric acid on the crystalline structure Most published studies agree that sulfation retards crystallization of zirconia support and then the transition from the tetragonal to the monoclinic form [2,15,18,19]. There was only a report of the opposite behavior, for an amorphous precursor precipitated from zirconium tetraisopropoxide which crystallized directly to the monoclinic form upon treatment with sulfuric acid at room temperature [20]. Also worth noting is the report that crystallinity of SZ prepared by the \"standard\" preparation procedure was determined by the pH of precipita- tion of the zirconium hydroxide precursor (between 6.0 and 9.3) and that only the precursor precipitated in basic medium (pH 9.3) gave a catalyst consisting entirely of the tetragonal form of zirconia [21]. In the previous study we found, however, that sulfated zirconia prepared from hydroxide consists of the tetragonal form [ 12]. The same form was seen in the XRD patterns of most materials prepared in this study; in all cases we precipitated zirconium hydroxide maintaining the pH D.

We think that it is possible that other, unnoticed experimental factors were at play in the experiments reported from the other laboratory; for instance, no sulfur analysis was reported [21 ]. As the parent ZrOz calcined at 550 was mostly monoclinic [21], it is reasonable to expect that at low sulfate coverage some monoclinic form would be present. Most interestingly, we found in the current work that at high sulfate levels the special stabilization of the tetragonal form starts to diminish. Thus, at a sulfate loading level higher than 5% S the XRD lines of the monoclinic form begin to appear and at the highest loading level investigated (5.64% S) they are definitely present, albeit still of much lower intensity than the lines of the tetragonal form. The XRD patterns of catalysts with varying sulfate loading prepared in this study are shown in Fig. 4. 3.1.4. Sulfate distribution as obtained from XPS As indicated in Section 2 the quantitative interpretation of the XPS spectra is complicated by the overlap of lines for Zr(IV) and S(VI). With this caution, the relative sulfate concentration for samples SZCH-0.95, SZCH-3.0, SZCH-4.0, and SZCH-5.0R were measured (after correction for a background of 0.15 for the parent zirconia) as 0.38, 1.40, 0.79, and 1.07, respectively. A comparison with the calculated sulfur loading (Table 1, column 5) shows immediately that at high sulfate content part of the sulfate has migrated into the bulk of the catalyst particles. These internal sulfate ions seem to be isolated in the zirconia matrix; no 180 D. F~rca~iu et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 154 (1997) 173-184 ,oo{ t1.0 5O Q.O 60. aO. ZO.

Comparison of activities of the catalysts for isomerization of methylcyclopentane at 65, XRD lines indicating the presence of a zirconium sulfate phase were observed (Fig. 4). 3.2. Catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia As discussed in our previous communication, a study of catalytic activity of sulfated metal oxides is most relevant when applied to the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons, the least reactive of the substrates converted so far by these catalysts [12]. Our choice of reaction has been the isomerization of methylcyclopentane (MCP) to cyclohexane (CH) at 65 [12,22]. The MCP conversion data are listed in Table 1 and plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. It can be seen that the MCP conversion is a function of sulfate loading. The MCP conversion increases with the increase in sulfur content up to 3% (catalyst prepared with 3.5 ml 1 N H2SO4 per gram of dry Zr(OH)4), then decreases as the sulfur content (sulfate) increases further. The sulfated zirconia prepared by the percolation technique [1-6], shown in Table l and Fig. 5 as SZPH-15, exhibits an activity at the lower end of the range of activities found for our catalysts, commensurate with its sulfur content. A correlation of activity with specific surface area is less satisfactory and it seems 182 D.

It is seen that the highest activity was exhibited after the specific surface area had peaked. There is no unanimity in literature as to the effect of sulfate loading level upon catalytic activity of SMO-s. Hint and Arata [13] studied the dehydration of propanol and found for one group of catalysts that the activity increases with sulfate loading up to 1.37%S (highest loading in the series), whereas for another group of catalysts a maximum in activity was observed at the rather low sulfur content of 0.8 %. Chen et al. [ 14] found that the rate of isomerization of n-butane at a given temperature changed with the sulfur content of the sulfated zirconia, but the catalysts used were calcined at varying temperature, and in addition, the experi- mental points were scattered. Nascimento et al. [7] also reported that the rate of n- butane transformation at 150 was a function of specific (\"intrinsic\") sulfur content (i.tmol/ma), but the data were badly scattered. But, other workers reported that the amounts of sulfate have no effect upon the rate of conversion of hexadecane at 150 [23]. Our data indicate that for the same calcination temperature catalytic activity is a function of the sulfate present on the surface, but an examination of the XPS data presented above indicates that the relationship is not a simple one, because the activity still increases after some sulfate has already migrated into the bulk. It appears likely that some of the sulfate groups present in the underlying layer might also contribute to the initiation of the carbocationic reaction by one-electron oxidation, characteristic to this type of bi- functional catalysts [22,24,25]. Considering that incorporation of promoters with redox properties [25,26] into sulfated zirconia increases greatly the catalytic activity [27] without changing the acidity measured by the standard techniques D. F{trcasiu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 173-184 183 [28], it is most likely that oxidizing ability is the activity-controling property of this and similar catalysts [26]. Once the reactive carbocation precursors have been generated by oxidation, the acid-catalyzed reactions proceed smoothly. At the same time, considering that the special oxidizing character of these materials is generated by the interaction of sulfate groups with the metal oxide [22,24,25], full coverage of the surface by sulfate, that is conversion of the surface to zirconium sulfate, should destroy the activity. The activity is also tied to the crystal structure of zirconia support, but the latter is in turn tied to the quantity of sulfur present as sulfate on the surface. As already observed by others [3,10,14,29] and confirmed by us [12], a zirconia support crystallized in the tetragonal form seems to be essential for high catalytic activity. The materials reported to be obtained directly in monoclinic form by sulfation were not tested for catalytic activity [20,30].

Tel. (+1-412) 6247449; fax. (+1-412) 6249639. The sulfur content of sulfated zirconia can be varied by changing the quantity of sulfuric acid used for impregnation in the controlled impregnation method, in which a pre-set quantity of sulfuric acid is added and evaporated without filtration or decanting. The material is then dried and calcined (in this work, for 5 h at 610°C). The sulfur content of the calcined material increases with the increase in the quantity of sulfuric acid, but the ratio of sulfate retained after calcination to sulfate impregnated decreases at first and then increases. The surface area gradually increases with the quantity of the acid up to 3 ml of acid per gram of zirconium hydroxide (2.5% S in SZ after calcination), then decreases abruptly. The crystal structure of the sulfated zirconia is also affected by the sulfur content. XRD data show that the sulfated zirconia with a low or medium sulfur content crystallizes only in the tetragonal form, whereas at higher sulfur content a minor fraction of monoclinic zirconia begins to be seen, in addition to the major tetragonal form. XPS data indicate that at the higher sulfate loading part of the sulfate is present in the bulk phase, rather than on the surface. Thus, the increase in sulfur uptake, decrease in surface area and change in crystallinity appear related to sulfate migration inside the particles. The catalytic activity for the isomerization of methylcyclopentane at 65°C shows a maximum for a sulfur content around 3%. It appears that the optimum catalyst should contain the maximum amount of sulfate near the surface, but not necessarily on the surface, and crystallize in the tetragonal form.
