Introduction Ruthenium complexes are good epoxidation catalysts, by being high-valent oxo-ruthenium species as active intermediates in the oxygen transfer reactions. The mechanism of the reac- tion, however, is still not fully understood and also the detailed nature of the oxiJizing species is not definitely established, since several types of oxo-ruthenium species can be formed with oxidation number ranging from IV to VIII. Most of the reported ruthenium-catabzed epoxida- tions are indeed affected by important by-reac- tions generally leading to less valuable oxy- genated compounds arising from the oxidative * Corresponding author.

It appears essential to control the epoxida- tion process relatively to the non-epoxide reac- tions, which must be avoided or at least mini- mized: as an example, whereas 'naked' high valent oxoruthenium species, i.e., in the absence of organic ligands, only effect the oxidative cleavage of the olefins [1], ruthenium com- plexes are generally also able to promote epoxi- dation, although with various selectivities [2- 19]. A better understanding of the factors influ- encing epoxidation would thus provide a basis for optimalization of the catalytic oxidation of alkenes by ruthenium derivatives. A recent critical review by Sheldon [2] on mechanistic and synthetic aspects of ruthenium-catalyzed epoxidations prompted us 1381- l 169/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Scien~:e B.V. All rights reserved.

Bressan / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 119-125 to re-examine a previously reported [4-6] alkene oxidation catalyzed by the five-coordinate phos- phino-complexes [RuIICI(LL)z]PF6 (LL= 1,3- bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, DPP, or 1-di- phenylphosphino-2-(2'-pyridyl)ethane, PPY), with the aim to further elucidate the mechanistic features of the competitive epoxidation versus oxidative cleavage reaction. In this paper we selected stilbenes (cis- and trans-) as a model for alkene oxidation, because they give stilbene epoxides and benzaldehyde as the only products in balanced yields. In the previous papers we reported that in the presence of catalytic amounts of the above ruthenium-complexes, the reaction between iodosobenzene and a number of olefins yields the corresponding epoxides and varying amounts of by-products, mainly from the allylic oxidation and/or the oxidative cleavage of the double bond. Several lines of evidence sup- ported that, upon reaction of the ruthenium(II) complexes under examination with PhlO, RuIV=o groupings are formed, rather than O=RuvI =O, which is another common feature in ruthenium(II) chemistry: indeed, from the reaction mixtures paramagnetic oxo-bridged [(LL) 2C1RunI(O)RumCI(LL)2 ]2+ complexes were isolated, whose formation is more likely to take place upon reaction of the coordinatively unsaturated [Run CI(LL)2] species and the pu- tative mono-oxo [RuIVCI(O)(LL)2]+ derivatives formed in situ [4]. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Materials Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, stored at -20 and used without further purification. Iodosoben- zene (K and K Rare and Fine Chemicals) was stored at -20 in the dark. The complexes [RuCI(DPP) 2 ]PF6 [20] and [RuCI(PPY) 2 ]PF6 [21] were prepared as previously described and stored at -20 under argon. 2.2. Kinetic measurements 1 ml of a dichloromethane solution contain- ing 0.01 + 0.4 mmol of the substrate, 0.002 + 0.01 mmol of the metal complexes and a gas- chromatographic standard (n-decane, 0.005 retool) were stirred magnetically in a vial to- gether with 11 + 110 mg of solid PhIO (0.05 + 0.5 retool) at 22. Organic analyses were per- formed on aliquots of the reaction mixture with- drawn at appropriate time with a hypodermic microsyringe, with a DANI 3800 gas chromato- graph equipped with FID, using 30 m SE-30 capillary column (0.25 mm i.d.). The identity of each product was confirmed by comparison of the fragmentation pattern in the mass spectra obtained with a VG 16F mass spectrometer operating in the electron ionization mode at 70 eV. Reaction rates were determined at 22 for early stages of the reaction and were repro- ducible to within 15%. 3. Results The reactions between iodosobenzene and cis-stilbene in the presence of small amounts of the ruthenium(II) complexes give cis- and trans-sfilbene epoxide and benzaldehyde, as the only identified oxidation products. The reaction with dilute cis-stilbene, 25 raM, and [RunCI(DPP)2]PF6 catalyst, 2 mM, was investi- gated in details, to allow the identification by glc-ms of all organic compounds present in the reaction mixtures at various times (Fig. 1). All oxidation products were formed contemporarily since the very onset of the reaction and main- tained their molar ratio throughout the reaction: direct control experiments confirmed that in the reaction conditions and within the times taken into consideration stilbene epoxides are not af- fected by rearrangement to benzaldehyde or by overoxidation, typically to benzophenone [17] and that no isomerization of cis-stilbene epox- ide to the trans-isomer occurs. The presence of added benzaldehyde does not affect the forma- A. Moruillo, M. Bres.;an / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 119-125 121 tion of the epoxides, thus ruling Out the possibil- ity that epoxidation could be triggered via the well-known mechanism of aldehyde co-oxida- tion of alkenes [13]. The ratio between cis- and trans-stilbene epoxide remains essentially the same during the reaction (ca. 0.7) and does not apparently depend upon the initial concentration of the substrate. Quite unexpectedly, trans-stil- bene was found in the reaction mixtures at the very beginning of the reaction in rather large amounts (ca. 25% of total alkere): the amount of trans-stilbene rapidly decreases to zero, par- alleling the decrease of cis-stilbene, well before the end of the oxidation, without affecting the rate of formation of trans-stilbene epoxide. Since the substrate cis-stilbene used was 99% purity grade, extensive isomerjzation of cis- stilbene to trans-stilbene migh. occur in the presence of the catalytic system (no isomeriza- tion was indeed observed in the presence of the catalyst, but in the absence ot the oxidizing agent). Mass balance, as calculated from the amount of benzaldehyde (divided per two), cis- and trans-stilbene epoxide and cis- and trans- stilbene, is close to 100% throulghout the reac- tion: control experiments confirmed that benzal- 25 q 20- |.. ~ -xi L--X--.--\" \"'X \"-, X X -X 15- \" :y-. \"0. g 10- -.. \" \"WW -4, / 5- A- .A~. 0 1 2 3 4 5 time,h Fig. 1.

It should be noted that in the experiments at higher substrate concentrations the ratio between formed Phi and oxidation products is much closer to the expected value of 1:1, indicating that in the presence of excess substrate the so-called 'lost oxygen' reaction [14] becomes less important. 2,0 1,5- ..~ 1,0- 0,5- 0,0- o',4 0',6 o; 1',0 log [catalyst] Fig. 3.

The extent of the oxidative cleavage reaction over the epoxidation is strongly dependent both upon the concentration of the substrate, with significant discrimination between the two examined cata- lysts, by being the cis-configuration better re- tained by the [RuCI(PPY)2]PF6 complex (Fig. 5a), and, more markedly, upon the concentra- tion of the catalyst, as expected by the fact that different reaction orders in the catalyst are ex- hibited by the two competitive reactions (Fig. 5b). The kinetics of the epoxidation of cis- and trans-stilbene was examinated in details in the previous paper [4], where a strictly linear rate dependence with respect to the catalyst concen- tration (Fig. 3) was reported, with reaction order to the substrate varying between zero and one (Fig. 4b). The competitive reaction of the oxida- tive cleavage of the double bond of the same substrates was investigated in the present work and was shown to obey a second order kinetic law to the metal catalyst (Fig. 3), with a pecu- liar rate dependence upon the substrate concen- tration, in which the rate increases with the concentration of the substrate until a maximum and then monotonically decreases, which is most 1,0 0,8- a--q 0,6- \"~.~ 0,4- 0,2- 0,0 .o _ g3---~- ....... -. ...... -~ ....- .... * ......

Discussion The results indicate that the two oxidation reactions, i.e., epoxidation and oxidative cleav- age, although competitive and based on the same catalytic system, proceed by different mechanisms. A simple mechanism was pro- posed for the epoxidation [4], which involves the fast formation of a ruthenium(IV) mono-oxo species upon reaction of PhIO with the starting complexes (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and the fast re- versible formation of a stable reaction interme- diate containing the metal complexes 'bonded' to both the oxygen to be transferred and the olefin (Eq. (3)), followed by a first-order slow step leading to the epoxides (Eq. (4)).

(5) We found that each olefin epoxidizes at differ- ent rates, a strong indication for a reaction intermediate involving the olefin, which clearly rules out a rate determining step consisting in the formation of the oxidizing metal-species, as A.

Metal-iodosobenzene adducts, which are the likely precursors to the high-valent metal oxo complexes (Eq. (l)), have been also suggested as themselves competent as oxidizing reagent, that can react directly with olefins [14]. We were not able to distinguish between the two possibilities by kinetic data alone and, although no evidence for such adducts was obtained dur- ing the present investigation, we cannot rule out that the actual putative oxidizing species may be a [(LL)2C1RulI(PhIO)]+ species, instead of the proposed [(LL)2CIRu~V=o]+ one: it should be noted however that this will oaly marginally affect the discussion of the kineti c data. Finally, the fact that the ratios of cis- to trans-stilbene oxide, formed upon epoxidation ~f cis-stilbene, are substantially independent upon the concen- tration of the substrate (Fig. 6)~ strongly sug- gests that isomerization depends upon a satura- tion mechanism. By treating the kinetic data of the epoxidation by the conventional Michaelis Menten analysis (Eq. (5)), the values of Km and Vmax for each olefin were ob:ained by the Lineweaver-Burk method, where Km can be regarded, as usual, as the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the reaction intermediate into the catalyst and the substrate (Eq. (3)) and gmax as the rate of the limiting step leading to the products in saturation conditions (Eq. (4)). The distinctive experimental rate law found for the competitive reaction of oxidative cleav- age, i.e., the second order in the catalyst, and the peculiar rate dependence on the substrate (Fig. 4a), is consistent with a mechanism in- volving again the pre-equilibrium described in Eq. (3), but followed by slow step, tentatively described in Eq. (6). The kinetic parameters are estimated assuming the kinetic law of Eq. (7).

(7) only in part fits with the observed rate dependence: at higher concentration of the sub- strates an additional term, probably dependent upon the concentration of the substrate, be- comes apparently important, likely arising from an independent oxidative cleavage of the double bond, which has been not further investigated. On this basis, the kinetic parameters for the oxidative cleavage can be estimated by the rate vs. [substrate] plot, by being the position of the maximum of Fig. 4a related to the value of Km of pre-equilibrium 3 and the corresponding val- Table 1 Kinetic parameters for the oxidation of stitbene (cis- and trans-) catalyzed by [RuCI(LL)2]PF6 complexes a Catalyst Substrate Epoxidation b Oxidative cleavage c (LL = ) d Km Vmaxe Kmd V~axe DPP cis 30 0.54 35 4- 10 ca. 4.0 DPP trans 30 0.33 30 _+ 20 _< 2.4 PPY cis 20 0.31 30 + 20 < 2.2 a Catalyst, [RuCI(LL)2]PF6 (LL = DPP, PPY), 2 raM, and sub- strate, 10-400 raM, in CH2CI2 with solid PhIO; 22. b Rates for the epoxidation were determined by the amount of stilbene epoxides (cis and trans) formed; kinetic parameters were calculated by a Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the data (see Ref.

The estimated values of Km for the oxida- tive cleavage reactions agree considerably well with those calculated from the conventional Michaelis-Menten treatment of the competitive epoxidation reaction (Table 1), by being an indirect, although suggestive, indication that the two competitive reactions share the same pre- equilibrium (Scheme 1). 5. Conclusion The kinetic behavior of the catalytic oxy- genations under examination is remarkably sim- ilar to that of natural enzymes and of some synthetic manganese-porphyrins in related oxy- genations of olefins [15,23,24]. For the case under examination all oxygenation products arise from a common reaction intermediate, which evolves via kinetically differentiated paths. The mechanistic conclusion drawn from our data has some relevance, since the mecha- nism of the oxidative cleavage is generally be- lieved, but not fully proven, to involve a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of a cis-dioxo moiety to the dou- ble bond [25]: however, very few cis- and trans-ruthenium-dioxo isomers sharing the same ligands have been compared and experimental data indicates that in many cases both trans- and cis-dioxo complexes equally afford epox- ides during the oxidation of alkenes [2,16,18,19], whereas very rarely mono-oxo- or trans-dioxo- ruthenium exhibits 100% selectivity in epoxida- tion. The distinctly different [substrate]-rate depen- dencies of the epoxidation and of the oxidative cleavage found in the system under investiga- tion make it possible, at least in principle, to divert the oxidation towards either the oxidative cleavage or the epoxidation, by simply changing the concentration conditions. At high substrate concentrations, where the experimental rates of the epoxidation reach a maximum and those of the oxidative cleavage approach zero, epoxides are expected to become the major products (see Fig. 5a). Since also the [catalyst]-rate dependen- cies are different for the two competitive reac- tions (first- versus second-order), major amounts of epoxides are expected to be obtained in the presence of diluted solutions of the catalyst, as clearly evidenced by the experimental trend de- picted in Fig. 5b. The proven possibility to trigger significant changes in the chemioselec- tivity of the oxidation by varying the concentra- tion conditions is noteworthy, for it suggests that one may ultimately generate 100% selectiv- ity in the alkene epoxidation by an accurate raise a point of the reaction conditions. Finally, also an appropriate choice of the ligands around ruthenium(II) may lead to more favorable epox- ide/benzaldehyde ratios: we observed that with the [RuCI(PPY)2]+ catalyst, epoxidation of cis-stilbene becomes more important than in the case of the closely related [RuCI(DPP)2]+ cata- lyst (Fig. 5a).

Tel.: +39-85-4537548; fax: +39-854537545 The catalytic oxidation of stilbenes, cis- and trans-, by iodosobenzene in the presence of the diphosphino-complexes of ruthenium(II) [RuCI(LL)2]PF6 (LL = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane, DPP; 1-diphenylphosphino-2-(2′pyridyl)ethane, PPY) gives rise to stilbene epoxides, cis- and trans-, and to benzaldehyde with distinctly different kinetic pathways. The reaction is first-order to the catalyst fpr the epoxidation and second-order for the oxidative cleavage, whereas the rate dependence upon substrate concentration indicates reversible formation of a common catalyst-substrate intermediate.
