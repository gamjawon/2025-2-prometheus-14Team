Graphical abstract With MoS2 that is smaller in slab size and layer number, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl prepared by ammonia-free co-precipitation is superior to traditional CoMo/MgAl prepared by incipient wetness impregnation in water-gas shift reaction. A series of CoMgAl mixed oxides with homogeneous Co dispersion were prepared using co-precipitation method. The CoMgAl composites were then doped with Mo species, giving Mo/Co(x)MgAl (x=Co/(Co+Mg)) catalysts for water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). In the synthesis of these catalysts, there is limited release of ammonia, which is traditionally common in the generation of Mo-Co catalysts for WGSR. The Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts were characterized using techniques such as XRD, N2-physisorption, H2-TPR, H2S-TPS, Raman, HRTEM and XPS. It is noted that the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst gives 91.2% CO conversion at 350 °C, which is close to the equilibrium CO conversion (91.7%). The H2S-TPS results disclose that there is decrease in activation energy for Mo sulfidation with increase of Co content in Mo/Co(x)MgAl, indicating the presence of Co promotes Mo sulfidation. The outcomes of HRTEM and XPS analyses reveal that the role of Co is to decrease stacking number and slab length of MoS2 moieties. The EDX elemental analysis suggests synergism between Co and MoS2, especially in the case of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl. With the formation of small-size MoS2 slabs and enhanced Co-MoS2 synergistic effect, the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst has high exposure of active sites, leading to improved catalytic activities in WGSR. Keywords Hydrotalcite Co(x)MgAl Ammonia-free Synergistic effect Water-gas shift reaction 1 Introduction Green and renewable hydrogen is essential for chemical processes such as ammonia synthesis, petroleum hydrocracking and refinement reactions [1–5]. With the crises of fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution, proper production and utilization of H2 is a matter of concern. Currently, hydrogen is produced in large scale by means of water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) using catalysts that are based on mixed metal oxides with active Fe, Cu or Co-Mo components [6–9]. In general, the feed gas is from coal gasification, which contains multiform of sulfur components [10]. It is known that compared to the Fe-based and Cu-based catalysts [8,11], the Co-Mo based ones exhibit higher sulfur tolerance [12], and are widely used in industry [13,14]. Up to now, there are different kinds of commercial Co-Mo based WGSR catalysts such as K8-11 (CoMo/MgAlO), SFB-03 (CoMo/MgAl2O4), and FBK-1P (CoMoK/Al2O3). Unfortunately, these catalysts are usually prepared by classical impregnation method in which Co and Mo precursors are dissolved in ammonia aqueous solution for the formation of Co-Mo complexes [12]. In the calcination process that follows, there is the release of a large amount NH3. In addition, pH adjustment using ammonia during co-impregnation is needed to avoid Co aggregation and separation of Co and Mo moieties that would result in Co-Mo based catalysts of limited activity [15]. In other words, to achieve homogeneous Co dispersion in Co-Mo based catalysts, the use of ammonia is critical [14]. In so doing, the Mo species could be well-dispersed automatically [15]. It is hence highly desirable to develop an ammonia-free way to prepare active Co-Mo based WGSR catalyst with homogeneous Co dispersion. Using hydrotalcite-like compounds as precursor, Wang et al. achieved homogeneous dispersion of Co sites [16]. As a kind of laminar materials, hydrotalcite-like compounds are composed of positively charged texalith-like layers and hydrous commutable anions [17]. Having a LDHs (layered double hydroxides) structure, the materials display properties such as high BET surface area, controllable and versatile composition, and good stability [16]. It was demonstrated that homogeneous dispersion of metal sites could be accomplished in catalysts that were derived from hydrotalcite-like compounds [16–18]. Furthermore, when mingled with metal ions (e.g., those of Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni), hydrotalcite-like compounds MgAl-LDHs gave highly dispersed and stable metal oxides during calcination [17–20]. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions such as ethanol transesterification [20], NO x and N2O removal [21], benzene oxidation [22], propane reforming [23], acetonitrile hydrogenation [24], ethanol dehydrogenation [25], and guaiacol synthesis [26], admirable performances were observed over catalysts that were derived from hydrotalcite-like materials. Meanwhile, materials derived from hydrotalcites also show excellent applicability in homogeneous catalytic reaction such as suberin depolymerisation [27] and gas capture such as CO adsorption [28]. Furthermore, hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite-like materials have been applied in industrial processes for the production of gases from biomass [29]. In brief, hydrotalcite-like compounds have a wide variety of applications. To develop efficient Co-Mo based catalysts for WGSR, a rational approach is to improve Co dispersion. The above information related to the use of hydrotalcite-like materials indicates that it is possible to synthesize Co-Mo based catalysts of high activity using hydrotalcite-like compounds as precursor. In the present work, we synthesized a series of Co(x)MgAl materials from hydrotalcite-like compounds by means of co-precipitation. Using the materials as support, Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts were prepared through incipient-wetness impregnation of Mo on Co(x)MgAl, and there is only limited release of NH3, which is derived from Mo(NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O in the calcination process that follows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LDHs-derived CoMgAl oxides were used to synthesize Co-Mo based WGSR catalysts. The catalysts were analyzed by XRD, ICP, N2-physisorption, H2-TPR, H2S-TPS, Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM and XPS techniques. Overall, homogeneous Co dispersion, MoS2 slabs of small size, enhanced Co-MoS2 synergism, and decreased activation energy for Mo sulfidation were observed over the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst. Compared to traditional CoMo/MgAl catalyst, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl shows excellent activities under similar WGSR condition. This strategy provides an ammonia-free way to prepare CoMo/MgAl catalysts that are high in Co dispersion and excellent for WGSR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of support materials Co(x)MgAl-LDHs were synthesized by co-precipitation. Typically, 12.5 mmol of Al(NO3)3•9H2O, x mmol of Co(NO3)2•6H2O and (62.5–x) mmol of Mg(NO3)2•6H2O [(Co2++Mg2+)/Al3+ = 5, Co2+/(Co2++Mg2+) = 1%˜7%] were dissolved in deionized water. Using a peristaltic pump, the solution was slowly added to a three-necked, round-bottomed flask that contained a certain amount of Na2CO3 aqueous solution at 25 °C. During the whole process, the pH of the mixture was kept at 10 ± 0.5 using aqueous NaOH (2 M). Then, the resulted suspension was allowed to stand at 90 °C for 24 h. The generated solid substance was collected by centrifugation, washed to neutrality with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C overnight. The precursors are denoted herein as Co(x)MgAl-LDHs. Finally, the substance was heated (3 °C/min) to 500 °C and calcined at this temperature for 4 h in ambient environment, and the as-obtained support materials are denoted herein as Co(x)MgAl. Likewise, a sample of MgAl support was synthesized without the participation of Co(NO3)2•6H2O. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Briefly, 5 g of a Co(x)MgAl support (20–40 mesh) was impregnated with a designated amount of Mo((NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O solution, and the mixture was subject to ageing at room temperature for 12 h before being dried at 100 °C for 4 h and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain the Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalyst with a MoO3 percentage of 7 wt%. Having the (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O solution replaced by a mixed solution of Co(NO3)2•6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O, a CoMo/MgAl catalyst with Co and Mo contents the same as those of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl was likewise prepared for comparison purposes. 2.3 Characterization Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of Co(x)MgAl-LDHs, CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(x)MgAl samples were performed over OPTIMA 8000 (PerkinElmer). H2S temperature-programmed sulfidation (TPS) was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 equipped with a corrosion resistant TCD. The weight of catalysts and pretreatment procedure was the same as that of H2-TPR investigation. The catalyst was heated from 50 to 550 °C at a ramp of 3 °C/min in a flow (30 ml/min) of 1%H2S/9%H2/90%He gas mixture. The peak area of H2S consumption was obtained by integral using the software of Micromeritics Autochem 2920 apparatus. Furthermore, the activation energy for Mo sulfidation (Esulf) could be evaluated using the Micromeritics Autochem 2920 instrument following the procedure described by Zhang et al. [7]. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were also conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 apparatus. The catalyst (precisely 50 mg) was pre-treated in a flow of pure He at 300 °C for 30 min. Then the catalyst was heated from 50 to 1000 °C (10 °C/min) under a flow (30 ml/min) of 10%H2/Ar with the concentration of hydrogen continuously monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The total H2 consumption of the Mo/CoMgAl catalysts was calculated on the basis of peak area and calibration curve according to the AutoChem II 2920 Operator's Manual. Laser Raman spectra of oxidic and sulfidic Mo/Co(x)MgAl and CoMo/MgAl catalysts were acquired on an inVia Reflex spectrometer using a 532 nm semiconductor laser at an intensity of 1%. HRTEM images were collected on a Zeiss Libra200 TEM at 200 kV (acceleration voltage). The oxidic Mo/Co(x)MgAl and CoMo/MgAl samples were pre-treated in 1%H2S/9%H2/90%He at 350 °C for 2 h before rapid dispersion in ethanol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement of the sulfided catalysts was performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific EscaLab 250Xi instrument. Catalyst charging during measurement was compensated using an electron flood gun. 2.4 Catalytic activity Catalytic activity test was performed in a vertical fixed-bed micro reactor with 5 ml oxidic catalyst (20–40 mesh) secured at the middle section. First, the catalysts were sulfided in a mixture of 10%H2S/H2 for 2 h at 350 °C, and catalytic activity measurements were carried out under the following conditions: reaction pressure of 0.15 MPa, temperature range of 200–450 °C, feed gas of 26 vol%CO/54 vol%H2/20 vol%CO2, space velocity of 2000 h−1 and steam/gas ratio = 1. In this work, CO concentration among reactants and reaction products was analyzed using on-line GC (Shimadzu GC-8 A). According to CO mass balance in the WGSR, the dry-basis CO content of the reactants is the sum of reacted CO and CO of reaction products (Taking 1 mol of dry-basis gas as reference). On the basis of mass balance and coefficient of WGSR reaction equation, CO mass balance (VCO) can be obtained as follows: (1) VCO = VCOXCO+(1+VCOXCO)V’CO Then CO conversion (XCO) can be calculated using Eq. 1, (2) XCO = [(1-V’CO/VCO)/(1+V’CO)]×100% Where VCO and V’CO are the inlet and outlet concentration of CO, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of Co content It is known that Co is an active component of WGSR catalysts that are Co-Mo based, and catalytic activity could be greatly improved at optimal Co content [14]. It is hence meaningful to optimize the x value of Mo/Co(x)MgAl for optimal performance. Also, through monitoring the dependence of physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of Mo/Co(x)MgAl on Co content, it is possible to gain insights into the related mechanism. 3.1.1 Catalyst performance According to the XRD results (Fig. S1), it is confirmed that Co(x)MgAl-LDHs were successfully synthesized using the co-precipitation method. Afterwards, Co(x)MgAl were obtained through the calcination of Co(x)MgAl-LDHs at 500 °C for 4 h (Fig. S2). The Co(x)MgAl samples are with BET surface area of 70–99 m2/g (Table 1 ). The loading of Mo on Co(x)MgAl would generate the Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts. Then these Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts were sulfided and tested for the water-gas shift reaction. As depicted in Fig. 1 , CO conversion over Mo/Co(x)MgAl increases with increasing temperature within the 200–350 °C range. Above 400 °C, it decreases with further rise of reaction temperature because WGSR is exothermic [1]. It is noteworthy that CO conversion is low at 200 °C, and it is only between 250 °C and 350 °C that there is a significant rise of CO conversion. It is noted that Mo/Co(5%)MgAl and Mo/Co(7%)MgAl show highest CO conversion at 350 °C. In addition, the activities of Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts first increase with increasing Co content from 1% to 5%; and further rise of Co content to 7% would result in decrease of activity. The Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst displays the best activity, which is 91.2% CO conversion at 350 °C, getting close to the CO conversion (91.75%) at equilibrium. Considering that CO conversion over Mo/Co(1%)MgAl at 400 °C is only ca. 69%, it is deduced that the introduction a proper amount of Co can effectively improve the catalytic performance of Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts, especially at temperatures below 350 °C. 3.1.2 H2S-TPS characterization The basicity of MgAl and Co(x)MgAl was characterized through CO2-TPD measurements (Fig. S5), and the basic nature of the supports promotes the dispersion of Mo components [4]. Furthermore, the results of H2-TPR studies (Fig. S6) suggest that the Mo species on Mo/Co(3% and 5%)MgAl are better dispersed and could be more easily reduced at higher Co contents. However, the Co-Mo based catalysts are active for WGSR only in the sulfided state. Hence it is necessary to identify the effect of Co content on catalyst sulfidation [14,30]. We performed H2S-TPS to characterize the effect of Co content on Mo/Co(x)MgAl sulfidation (Fig. 2 ). All the Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts exhibit one H2S consumption peak attributable to the sulfidation of Mo oxides [4]. It is noted that the peak position shifts from 465 to 397 °C with increasing Co content, suggesting enhanced sulfidation by Co presence, in parallel to the H2-TPR results. On the basis of the weight-normalized H2S consumption depicted in Fig. 2 (Inset), H2S consumption becomes rapid and fast reaching equilibrium with the increase of Co content. The Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst consumes the highest amount of H2S, indicating that it is the most enriched with surface MoS2, which is known to be active for WGSR [31]. However, the Mo/Co(7%)MgAl catalyst shows decreased amount of H2S consumption, which could be due to Mo agglomeration. Overall, the H2S-TPS results are consistent with the fact that Mo/Co(5%)MgAl shows the best catalytic activity in WGSR. 3.2 Investigation on the method of Co introduction The above results demonstrate that the Co contents of Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts have an effect on WGSR, and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl performs the best among the Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts. The adopted preparation method is more environmentally friendly because there is no addition of ammonia solution. It is meaningful to compare the adopted method with the traditional one to reveal how catalytic performance can be affected by the way of Co introduction into the Co-Mo based catalysts. We prepared a CoMo/MgAl catalyst by traditional co-impregnation method with Co and Mo contents equal to those of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl, and studied the catalytic activity over the two catalysts. Furthermore, the physico-chemical properties of these two catalysts were characterized and discussed together with the catalytic performance. 3.2.1 Catalytic performance The catalytic performances of the sulfidic Co-Mo based catalysts and a commercial CoMo/MgAl2O4 catalyst were evaluated (Fig. 3 (A)). It is noted that the commercial CoMo/MgAl2O4 catalyst contains 3.5 wt% of CoO and 8.5 wt% of MoO3 which are higher than those of CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalysts (around 3.31 wt% CoO and 7 wt% MoO3). The catalytic activity of the three follows the order of: Mo/Co(5%)MgAl > CoMo/MgAl > CoMo/MgAl2O4 > Co(5%)MgAl, which suggests that MgAl is a better support than MgAl2O4. Compared with CoMo/MgAl, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl displays much higher CO conversion, especially at lower temperatures such as 250 and 300 °C. Furthermore, the catalytic stability of CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl were tested at 350 °C under the same condition. As shown in Fig. 3(B), the CO conversion over Mo/Co(5%)MgAl remains constant at ca. 91% in a test of 60 h, displaying high stability. As for CoMo/MgAl, CO conversion is ca. 58% in a period of 40 h before starting to decrease. The well dispersion and good stability of the Co(5%)MgAl support ensure the high stability of the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst. The above results confirm that our method for the introduction of Co is superior to the traditional one, especially in terms of stability and low-temperature performance of the prepared catalysts. 3.2.2 Raman, H2-TPR, and H2S-TPS characterization The results of H2-TPR and Raman spectroscopic studies indicate that the methods of Co introduction have a strong influence on the reduction behavior and chemical state of Mo species. In H2-TPR studies, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl shows two reduction peaks at around 466 °C and 851 °C, whereas CoMo/MgAl shows three peaks at 554, 730 and 819 °C; these peaks can be related to the reduction of tetrahedra Mo6+ to Mo4+ of polymeric Mo entities as well as to the gradual reduction of Mo4+ to Mo [32–34] (Fig. S7). It is deduced that the interaction between Mo and support of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is less complex and weaker than that of the CoMo/MgAl. As for Raman investigations, the signal at around 840 cm−1 detected over oxidic Mo/Co(5%)MgAl ascribable to Mo-O-Mo vibration can also be seen over oxidic CoMo/MgAl (Fig. S8) [35]. As for the sulfidic ones, SE/SA ratio (relative area ratio of E1 2g and A1g peaks) of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is apparently higher than that of CoMo/MgAl, suggesting that the MoS2 of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is more enriched with Mo-S species than that of CoMo/MgAl (Fig. S9) [36]. Furthermore, we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses based on the H2S-TPS results (Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 4(A), the H2S consumption peak detected over Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is at 436 °C, significantly lower than that of CoMo/MgAl which is at 458 °C, proving that the way for Co introduction has an effect on Mo sulfidation. According to weight normalized consumption (Fig. 4(A), inset), Mo/Co(5%)MgAl consumes a larger amount of H2S than does CoMo/MgAl, indicating a larger amount of Mo is converted to MoS2 over the former. As shown in Fig. 4(B), the Esulf of Mo sulfidation over CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is 89 kJ/mol and 79 kJ/mol (Table 1), respectively, implying that the latter is more easily sulfided. Despite both catalysts show Esulf higher than that of bulk MoO3 (48.1 kJ/mol), they display Esulf much lower than that of commercial CoMo/MgAl2O4, which is 126 kJ/mol (calculated based on H2S-TPS results obtained over CoMo/MgAl2O4). The results confirm that Mo sulfidation occurs more readily in the case of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl, which is a positive factor for WGSR. 3.2.3 HRTEM and elemental mapping In the HRTEM images of sulfided CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl (Fig. 5 ), the layered MoS2 slab-like structures can be clearly seen [37]. Compared with Mo/Co(5%)MgAl, CoMo/MgAl shows multideck MoS2 slabs, suggesting MoS2 slabs formation is promoted over CoMo/MgAl. The STEM images and elemental mappings of CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The pictures of EDX elemental analysis are also shown. The Co/(Mo + S) molar ratio of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl (0.395) is higher than that of CoMo/MgAl (0.134), which suggests that the amount of Co in the MoS2 slabs of sulfided Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is much higher than that of sulfided CoMo/MgAl. The results of elemental mapping reveal that Co, Mo and S dispersion on Mo/Co(5%)MgAl is homogeneous, confirming efficiency of the synthetic method deployed in this work for Co dispersion. According to Chen et al. based on density functional theory, Co of Co-MoS2 functions as a textual promoter for the acceleration of WGSR rate [14]. Thus, an enhanced synergism between Co and MoS2 is relevant for improvement of WGSR activity. Furthermore, a smaller stacking number of MoS2 would mean higher exposure of active sites [14,24,38]. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of MoS2 moieties derived from the statistical data obtained over the HRTEM images of sulfided CoMo/MgAl and Mo/Co(5%)MgAl. Statistically, the MoS2 slabs of CoMo/MgAl is higher in stacking number and longer in length than those of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl. The data suggest that the MoS2 slabs on CoMo/MgAl are larger and thicker than those on Mo/Co(5%)MgAl, plausibly a consequence of difference in interaction between Mo and supports. Endowed with thinner and shorter MoS2 slabs, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl has larger amount of active sites and hence higher catalytic activity. According to Topsøe [39] and Shimada et al. [40], there are Type I and Type II Co-Mo-S sites on sulfidic Co-Mo based catalysts. The one-layered MoS2 slabs with edge Co belongs to Type I, while the multi-layered MoS2 slabs embedded with Co (except for the bottom layer) belongs to Type II [41]. On the basis of the HRTEM and activity results of the present study, it is concluded that Type I sites are active for WGSR. They are different from the Type II ones which are active for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions [39]. 3.2.4 XPS characterization The XPS technique was used to study the chemical state and surface component of the sulfided catalysts and the results are shown in Table S1, Fig. S10 and Fig. 8 . Compared with CoMo/MgAl, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl has higher percentage of Co in the form of CoMoS (61.0%) and lower percentage of Co in the form of Co9S8 species (14.4%), evidencing that the method deployed for the preparation of Co(x)MgAl has the advantage of generating more CoMoS on the Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts [42,43]. The Mo3d spectra of the sulfided catalysts (Fig. 8) could be deconvoluted into three sets of Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 peaks. The Mo3d5/2 signals at binding energy of 228.6, 230.4 and 232.2 eV are assigned to MoS2 (Mo4+), oxysulfide MoOxSy (Mo5+) and MoO3 (Mo6+) species, respectively [44,45]. In Fig. 8, the S2s peaks at 225.9 eV can also be seen [45]. The relative amounts of MoS2, MoOxSy and MoO3 species are listed in Table S1. Compared with CoMo/MgAl, Mo/Co(5%)MgAl has higher percentage of MoS2 (41.8%) and lower percentage of MoO3 (49.8%), revealing again that the adopted method for Co(x)MgAl formation has the advantage of facilitating Mo sulfidation of Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts for the creation of Type I active sites. Based on the data in Table S1, the sulfidation degree of Mo oxides (Wsulf) defined by Yue et al. [46] as the ratio of Mo4+ (MoS2) to the sum of Mo4+ (MoS2), Mo5+ (MoOxSy) and Mo6+ (MoO3) was estimated. The Wsulf of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl (41.8%) is obviously higher than that of CoMo/MgAl (21.6%), indicating better Mo sulfidation over the former, in good agreement with the H2S-TPS results. 4 Conclusions According to the physico-chemical properties and catalytic performance of the Co-Mo based catalysts described in the present study, the method of co-precipitation for the fabrication of Co(x)MgAl has the advantage of generating highly active Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts for WGSR. The Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst is superior to the commercial CoMo/MgAl2O4 catalyst in activity, showing lower Mo sulfidation activation energy, improved Co dispersion, optimal MoS2 slab size, and enhanced Co-MoS2 synergism. The method demonstrated in this study is original, effective and ammonia-free for the preparation of Co(x)MgAl for the synthesis of Co-Mo based WGSR catalysts. With adjustable Mo active sites, the strategy is suitable for the development of next-generation catalysts for the WGSR.

        "dc:description": "A series of CoMgAl mixed oxides with homogeneous Co dispersion were prepared using co-precipitation method. The CoMgAl composites were then doped with Mo species, giving Mo/Co(x)MgAl (x=Co/(Co+Mg)) catalysts for water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). In the synthesis of these catalysts, there is limited release of ammonia, which is traditionally common in the generation of Mo-Co catalysts for WGSR. The Mo/Co(x)MgAl catalysts were characterized using techniques such as XRD, N2-physisorption, H2-TPR, H2S-TPS, Raman, HRTEM and XPS. It is noted that the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst gives 91.2% CO conversion at 350 °C, which is close to the equilibrium CO conversion (91.7%). The H2S-TPS results disclose that there is decrease in activation energy for Mo sulfidation with increase of Co content in Mo/Co(x)MgAl, indicating the presence of Co promotes Mo sulfidation. The outcomes of HRTEM and XPS analyses reveal that the role of Co is to decrease stacking number and slab length of MoS2 moieties. The EDX elemental analysis suggests synergism between Co and MoS2, especially in the case of Mo/Co(5%)MgAl. With the formation of small-size MoS2 slabs and enhanced Co-MoS2 synergistic effect, the Mo/Co(5%)MgAl catalyst has high exposure of active sites, leading to improved catalytic activities in WGSR.",
