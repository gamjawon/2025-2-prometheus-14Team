Friedel-Crafts reaction of 2-alkylfurans with 3-substituted allylic alcohols Felipe Algarra, Avelino Corma *, Hermenegildo Garcfa, Jaime Primo hzstituto de Tecnologia Qu{mica CSIC-UPV and Departmento de Qu(mica, Universidad Polit~cnica de Valencia, Apartado 22012, 46071-Valencia. Spain Received 20 June 1994: revised 19 September 1994: accepted 19 September 1994 Abstract Methyl 3- ( 2-furyl ) propanoate ( 1 ) and 3- ( 2-furyl ) propyl acetate ( 3 ) can be conveniently alkylated with high conversion and selectivity by cinnamyl and crotyl alcohols in the liquid phase at moderate temperatures using acid zeolites of medium and large pore size as heterogeneous catalysts. ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited the highest turnover number for the heteroaromatic alkylation. This reaction was found to be totally regioselective at the 5 position of the substituted heterocyclic ring, as well as chemoselective with regard to either the C=C double bond of the allylic alcohol or ester groups on the lateral chain of the furan. However, two alkylation products (linear and branched), arising from a non-regioselective attack on the 1 or 3 position of the allylic alkylating reagent, are generally observed. Formation of the corresponding symmetric ethers by dehydration of the alcohols, especially at lower reaction temperatures and higher alcohol molar ratios, is a competing side reaction. Keywords: Alkylation; Friedel-Crafts reaction: Zeolites; ZSM-5 1. Introduction Fine chemicals are generally complex organic molecules, characterized by the concurrence of different functionalities. Therefore, catalysts required for the prep- aration of this type of compounds must display a high degree of chemoselectivity in order to avoid undesired side-reactions. Zeolites [I-4] in their H+-form are widely used as heterogeneous acid catalysts, [5-7] including large-scale petro- * Corresponding author. E-mail: itq@upvnet.upv.es, fax.

Algarra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 125-134 chemical processes [8]. Moreover, by appropriate choice of zeolite physicochem- ical parameters, such as the framework Si-to-AI ratio and crystalline structure, it is possible to control the acid strength distribution, hydrophobicity of the surfaces, accessibility of the sites and dimensions of the reaction cavity. This allows the tuning of the zeolite properties to a particular chemical transformation. Application of acid zeolites as catalysts for the preparation of fine chemicals is a topic of much current interest [ 9,10]. Among the reactions where the use of acid zeolites can be a viable alternative to conventional catalysts, much attention has been paid to the Friedel-Crafts aromatic substitution [ 5-7,1 I, 12 ]. Besides the fact that Lewis or BrOnsted acids are typically destroyed during the work-up subsequent to the reaction, the available conventional catalysts display a poor chemoselectivity. Thus, when the alkylating reagent encom- passes several functional groups, the final products generally arise from the con- secutive reaction of some of these groups. A paradigmatic example is allyl alcohol, which under the relatively drastic conditions required for the alkylation gives rise to diarylpropanes derived from the reaction of both the hydroxyl and the C=C double bond [ 13 ]. In the present work we have studied the reaction of 2-alkylfurans with cinnamyl and crotyl alcohols in the presence of acid medium and large-pore zeolites as catalysts in the liquid phase under mild conditions. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of furans usually leads to complicated reaction mixtures due to the high reactivity of these heterocycles [ 14]. In some cases, an indirect efficient strategy, consisting of metallation with n-BuLi at the 5 position of furan and subsequent reaction with primary alkyl halides, has been developed to overcome the low yields of the direct aromatic alkylation pathway. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts\" HY (Si/Al 2.6, unit cell size 24.56 A) zeolite was prepared bu stirring a sus- pension of commercial NaY (Union Carbide, SK-40) at room temperature in an 0.2 M aqueous solution of ammonium acetate using a solid:liquid ratio 1:10 for 1 h. After this time, the solid was filtered, thoroughly washed with distilled water, dried (100, 5 h) and calcined (500, 2 h). The resulting partially exchanged NaHY sample was submitted to two additional exchange-calcination cycles under the same conditions as above but using 0.4 M and 0.6 M solutions of ammonium acetate. A more detailed experimental procedure has been reported elsewhere [ 20]. H/3 was prepared by template decomposition (550) of an as-synthesised tetrae- thylammonium sample (Si/A1 13), obtained by hydrothermal treatment (135, 15 h) of a gel whose composition was 2KOH:4NaOH: 25 (Et) 4N + OH - :A1203:50SiOz:750H20 following the protocol reported in the lit- F. Algarra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 125-134 127 erature [21]. HMor (Si/A1 10, Na20 content <0.02 wt.-%, surface area 550 mR g ~ ) and H-ZSM-5 (Si/A1 17, crystal size 1-3/xm, surface area 430 m2 g- J ) were supplied by PQ Industries. 2.2. Organic substrates Cinnamyl and crotyl alcohol (mixture of cis and trans isomers) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Methyl 3- (2-furyl) propanoate ( 1 ) was obtained by condensation of furfural with malonic acid in pyridine, followed by esterification of the resulting crotonic acid with dimethyl sulphate in the presence of lithium hydroxide monohydrate and final hydrogenation using Pd/C catalyst. The detailed experimental procedure can be found in the literature [22]. Lithium aluminium hydride ( 1.5 equivalents) reduction of methyl ester 1 in dry ethyl ether (50 ml) at 0 afforded 3-(2-furyl)-1-propanol 2 (88%), while acetylation of the latter with acetic anhydride in pyridine (5 ml) and catalytic amounts of 4-dimethylaminopyr- idine gave rise quantitatively to the acetate derivative 3. 2.3. Reaction procedure Zeolites (1.00 g) were thermally (150) activated under vacuum (1 Torr, 133.3 Pa) for 2 h and cooled down to room temperature just prior to use. Then, a solution of the corresponding compound ( 100 mg) and nitrobenzene ( 100 mg) as internal standard in tetrachloromethane (50 ml) previously heated at the required temperature, was poured onto the catalysts and the suspension magnetically stirred at controlled temperature. The course of the reaction was periodically followed by analysing the organic phase using a gas chromatograph (HP 5980A) provided with a 25 m capillary column of 5% phenylmethylsilicone. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed with fresh solvent and submitted to continuous solid-liquid extraction using dichloromethane as solvent. The combined organic solutions were concentrated and the residue weighed and analyzed by gas chro- matography (GC), and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (HP5988A spectrom- eter, same conditions as GC) and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (IH-NMR) (Varian Unity +, 400 MHz, CDC13 as solvent, TMS as internal standard). Products were isolated by column chromatography using mixtures of hexane-dichlorome- thane as eluent. Hydrolysis of acetate 3 into the propanol 2 could be accomplished quantitatively by stirring a solution of 3 ( 100 rag) in acetone (20 ml) at room temperature in the presence of potassium carbonate (500 rag) for 3 h. 2.4.

Results and discussion The starting methyl 3- ( 2-furyl ) propanoate ( 1 ) and 3- ( 2-furyl ) - 1 -propanol ( 2 ) were synthesized from furfural by condensation with malonic acid, decarboxyla- tion, esterification and partial hydrogenation as outlined in Scheme 1. The acetate derivative 3 was prepared by reaction of 2 with acetic anhydride in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP). Compounds like 2 and 3, encompassing a functionalized three carbon side chain at the 2 position of the furan, are precursors of spiroacetals, [15] some of which exhibit a potent activity as antagonists of juvenile hormones for some insects. However, the final acetalization step requires the presence of labile OH or OAc groups on the alkyl lateral chain in 2 and 3, which are expected to exert a negative influence on the course of the alkylation on the heterocyclic ring. Reaction of methyl ester 1 with cinnamyl alcohol (4) was carried out by stirring equimolar solutions of these reagents in CC14 at different temperatures in the presence of the corresponding acid zeolites. The results achieved are collected in Table 1. Besides unreacted furan 1, the isomeric cinnamyl derivatives 5 and 6 arising from alkylation of furan 1 were formed in all cases (Scheme 2). Variable amounts of cinnamyl ethers 7 and 8 were also present. Similar results reporting the lack of reactivity of C=C double bond in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene and toluene catalyzed by acid Y zeolites have recently been published [ 12]. Time-conversion plots of the reaction established that cinnamylfurans are pri- mary and stable products, while cinnamyl ethers, formed preferentially at lower reaction temperatures (see Table 1 ), are primary but unstable products. A typical reaction kinetics is illustrated by Fig. 1, which corresponds to the alkylation of furan 1 by cinnamyl alcohol in the presence of HY zeolite. Precedents about the instability of related dibenzyl ethers which can act as alkylating reagents in the presence of solid acid catalysts can be found in the literature [ 16-18]. )--CHO ?--C =CHCOO.

Comparison of the initial rates of alkylation to give 5 and 6 established that medium pore-size ZSM-5 is the sample with the higher turnover number for this reaction. This fact, together with the lack of regioselectivity in the allylic attack to form both linear and vinylic products, would indicate that the crystalline framework of the zeolites does not impose geometrical restrictions to the products under any of the conditions studied in this work. In order to learn more about the chemoselectivity of acid zeolites as catalysts, reaction of cinnamyl alcohol was also carried out with derivatives 2 and 3 having an OH and OAc functional group on the side chain, respectively (Table 1, last two entries). In the case of furylpropanol 2, although the starting material progressively disappeared from the organic solution, selectivity to heterocyclic alkylation prod- ucts (9 + 10) is remarkably low. This fact can probably be due to a strong adsorption of the polar OH group onto the catalyst surface and/or the possible formation of self-alkylation oligomers of the type found for benzyl alcohol and derivatives using Nation as catalyst [ 19]. In support of this assumption, thermo- gravimetric analysis of the ZSM-5 catalysts used in this reaction revealed the presence of considerable amounts of non-recoverable organic material. By contrast, reaction of cinnamyl alcohol with the corresponding acetate deriv- ative 3 proceeded smoothly with much higher selectivity to the alkylation products 11 and 12. This result illustrates the negative influence of a free OH group of the furan lateral chain in the course of this reaction. This effect can be overcome by protecting the OH prior to the alkylation step, since we have observed that this acetate can be hydrolyzed under extremely mild basic conditions. Likewise, alkylation of furan derivative 3 was carried out using the less reactive crotyl alcohol instead of cinnamyl alcohol (Table 2 and Scheme 3 ). As anticipated, yields of the 2-butenylfurans 14 (mixture of cis and trans stereoisomers) and 15 were much lower than those obtained for 11 and 12 under the same conditions and F.

Thus, we observed that products 14 and 15 are formed with higher conversion and selectivity using 10 equivalents of crotyl alcohol. As observed for cinnamyl alcohol, compounds arising from reaction of the crotylic C=C double bond could not be detected. In conclusion, we have found that acid zeolites are highly chemoselective cata- lysts to perform the regioselective alkylation (5 position of the heterocycle ring) of 2-alkylfurans with 3-substituted allylic alcohols. Thus, the C=C double bond of the product lateral chain is totally unaffected under our experimental conditions. However, this process displays a poor regioselectivity with respect to the 1 or 3 position of the ailylic alkylating reagent and two products (linear and branched) are generally formed.

Methyl 3-(2-furyl) propanoate (1) and 3-(2-furyl) propyl acetate (3) can be conveniently alkylated with high conversion and selectivity by cinnamyl and crotyl alcohols in the liquid phase at moderate temperatures using acid zeolites of medium and large pore size as heterogeneous catalysts. ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited the highest turnover number for the heteroaromatic alkylation. This reaction was found to be totally regioselective at the 5 position of the substituted heterocyclic ring, as well as chemoselective with regard to either the CC double bond of the allylic alcohol or ester groups on the lateral chain of the furan. However, two alkylation products (linear and branched), arising from a non-regioselective attack on the 1 or 3 position of the allylic alkylating reagent, are generally observed. Formation of the corresponding symmetric ethers by dehydration of the alcohols, especially at lower reaction temperatures and higher alcohol molar ratios, is a competing side reaction.
