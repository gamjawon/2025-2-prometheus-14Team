E. Martell and R. J. Motekaitis, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, 1988, xiv + 216 pages, ISBN 0-89573-715-9, price DM 74.00 The volume of stability data that has been produced in various parts of the world has resulted in a high diversity in both the nature and quality of the publications in this field. The use of computers has revolutionized the calculation of stability constants from equilibrium data. This volume teaches the computation and use of stability constants for systems that may even become very complex due to their high multicompo- nent nature. Considerable attention is devoted to safeguards and methods for avoiding misinterpretation and over-interpretation of equilibrium data. The book is divided into ten chapters which cover the determination of various equilibrium constants, common errors and their elimination or mini- mization, the selection of critical stability constants and the development of a complete critical metal complex data base. Three programs, available on diskette, are included with the book. PKAS is a fast computer program for the calculation of protonation con- stants from potentiometric data. BEST is a program for the computation of titration curves from user-supplied input data. SPE computes species distri- bution for given stability constants. All of them are written in Fortran and designed to run efficiently on a personal computer. A most interesting volume indeed, which is relevant in particular for those researchers dealing with or interested in problems involving analytical chemistry, metal complexation, corrosion and chemical cleaning, environ- mental problems, membrane and catalytic research, and metallurgy. ERIC G. DEROUANE Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, Volume 46 Zeolites as Catalysts, Sorbents and Detergent Builders edited by H. G. Karge and J. Weitkamp, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, 1989. 872 pages, ISBN 0-444-87 383-X, price US$ 184.25/Dfl. 350.00 Also available from Elsevier Sci. Pub. Co., P.O. Box 1663, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163. This book contains seventy-six original contributions on recent work dealing with the fundamental and technological aspects of zeolite research and application. This volume is the proceedings of an international sym- 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 136 posium in zeolite science, with emphasis on catalytic, sorption and ion- exchange properties, held in WUrzburg (F.R.G.) in September 1988. Aside from the classical areas in zeolite synthesis, characterization and utilization, topics which are either novel or of current interest are also covered. We note in particular the new applications of zeolites in the syn- thesis of fine chemicals, the novel formulations of detergent builders, and new industrially developed zeolite-based separation processes. Ecological and economic points of view in zeolite uses are also discussed. Several contributions are by experts of international reputation from both the industrial and academic communities. The contributions are well- organized, and a detailed keyword index enables quick and easy retrieval of pertinent information. This volume is indispensable in the library of any laboratory which has an interest in zeolite science. ERIC G. DEROUANE Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, Volume 48 Structure and Reactivity of Surfaces edited by C. Morterra, A. Zecchina and G. Costa, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, 1989, xiv + 970 pages, ISBN 0-444-87465-8, price US$ 184.25/ Dfl. 350.00 Also available from Elsevier Sci. Pub. Co., P.O. Box 1663, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163. This book reports the proceedings of a European conference held in Trieste (Italy) in September 1988. This scientific meeting aimed at decreasing the gap between the area known as surface science (dealing essentially with single crystal surfaces) and the vast amount of information concerning the surface properties of dis- persed solids (knowledge that is applied in catalysis and materials science), with special emphasis on metal-support interfaces. These proceedings bring together ninety-three contributions, com- prising plenary lectures, communications and posters, about metals, oxides and -'' ' ed systems. in/ited plenary lectures were by A. T. Bell (Surface carbonaceous species), H. P. Boehm (Surface properties of carbon), A. M. Bradshaw (Structure and bonding of adsorbates), S. Coluccia (Surface optical spectres- copies), J. Haber (Structure sensitivity in catalysis by oxides), A. Masson (Free and supported metal clusters), R. Prins (Metal-support interaction), M. W. Roberts (Overlayers studied by electron spectroscopy), and L. Woste (Reactivity of metal clusters). These examples illustrate best the breadth of this symposium.
