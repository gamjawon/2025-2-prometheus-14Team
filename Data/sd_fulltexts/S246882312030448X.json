Graphical abstract It is an urgent desire to decrease release of methane, a potential greenhouse gas, over methane-oxidation catalysts. However, the commonly used Pd-based catalysts normally suffer from poor hydrothermal stability. Here, we report a Pd-Pt bimetallic nano-catalyst stabilized by magnesia-alumina spinel via a facile doping strategy for lean methane combustion. The promoted effects of platinum on the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst are confirmed by XRD, HRTEM, STEM, XPS, CO-DRIFTS characterizations. Pd-Pt bimetallic catalyst can almost maintain its intrinsic catalytic activity (2.7 × 10−5 molCH4 gnoble metal -1s-1 at 260 °C) after harshly hydrothermal aging, while the aged analogous sample without Pt promotion presents remarkably reduced catalytic performance with an increment in CH4 light-off temperature of ca. 50 °C. Kinetic analysis further reveals a much higher turnover frequency (0.011 s-1 at 260 °C) and lower apparent activation energy (119 kJ/mol) of CH4 oxidation on the aged Pd-Pt bimetallic samples. Pt stabilized by magnesia-alumina spinel has a strong interaction with PdO. This interaction could stabilize Pd species in active PdO and also suppress the decomposition of active PdO to less reactive Pd°. Consequently, the sintering resistance of Pt and PdO crystallite and the electron interaction between them could be responsible for the enhanced hydrothermal stability.

Catalyst is always used to activate methane during its application or emission control. However, conversion of the unburned methane from natural gas vehicles exhaust is still rather challenging [3]. Fortunately, owing to rapid development of nano-catalysis, last decades have witnessed great successes in methane activation via low-temperature combustion under lean conditions [4–7]. This reaction has been widely used in energy utilization and pollution governance. Supported Pd-based nano-catalyst is highly active and extensively applied in industrial application for methane combustion [6,8–10]. The catalytic performance can be affected by many parameters, for instance, metal-support interaction, chemical characteristic, redox properties, catalyst pretreatment and synthesis method [11]. As a key factor, the metal nanoparticles size has received extensive attention since it was closely related to the accessible active sites. Hicks et al. [12] investigated the effect of Pd size on the activity of lean methane combustion over supported Pd catalysts and reported that the turnover frequency (TOF) (0.02 s−1) over small Pd nanoparticles (NPs) (∼1.3 nm) was lower than that (1.3 s−1) over large Pd ones (∼4.0 nm) but the apparent activation energy (Ea) for these two Pd nanoparticles was almost the same (∼28 kJ/mol). The result indicates that careful monitoring Pd NPs can adjust the activity of methane oxidation. Stakheev et al. [13] tested the conversion of methane over Pd/Al2O3 with varied size of Pd particles (1.5−22 nm) and found that the medium size of Pd (∼5.0 nm) presented the highest activity of methane elimination, whereas the smallest Pd ones (∼1.5 nm) showed the lowest catalytic performance. Small PdO crystallites normally accompany with remarkably increased Pd-O bond strength. Therefore, high energy is required to cleavage the Pd-O band for small PdO nanoparticles [14,15]. These results illustrate that the catalytic performance of lean methane combustion over Pd-based nano-catalyst was closely associated with the size of Pd particle. Although high initial methane conversion, Pd-based nano-catalyst normally suffers from poor hydrothermal stability during long-term working conditions [16]. The sintering of PdO crystallite, the main active species for lean methane combustion [2], results in catalytic deactivation because of a decrease in available active sites on the catalysts surface [17]. Particularly, the presence of steam in industrially hydrothermal situation can dramatically accelerate the sintering of PdO nanoparticles because of a remarkable rise in surface free energy [18]. Besides, the thermal decomposition of active PdO to metallic Pd can also occur during high-temperature operational circumstance, which leads to an undesirable degradation of catalytic performance [19]. Therefore, it is an urgent desire to develop highly efficient Pd-based catalysts to meet the increasingly strict emission standards, such as Europe VI ab, China VI ab and US vehicle greenhouse gas (2022–2025) [20]. The stability of PdO active phase during severely hydrothermal condition is essential to achieve the optimal catalytic performance. It is commonly accepted that supports significantly affect the catalytic behavior of Pd-supported catalysts via the interaction with active phase. γ-Al2O3 is one of the widely used supports for dispersing PdO active phase due to its high surface area and mechanical properties. The state-of-the-art PdO based catalysts loaded on γ-Al2O3 have been previously used in industrial practice [21]. However, PdO/γ-Al2O3 still endures significant deactivation due to the sintering and decomposition of active PdO on γ-Al2O3 [21]. The element doping or surface modification is a facile strategy to resist the aggregation of active PdO. Mg-modified Al2O3 seems to improve the catalytic activity possibly because of the enhanced dispersion of active phase [22]. Nevertheless, in order to meet the demand emission regulation, it is still a need to further improve the hydrothermal stability of PdO-supported catalyst [23,24]. Multi-metallic nanostructures considerably affect the catalytic performance and have been systematically investigated [4,25,26]. Adding another metal to Pd-only catalyst may change its intrinsic physiochemical properties, such as melting point, electronic properties and surface composition. Specially, the development of Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts has achieved great attention because each metal can contribute to the overall characteristic of the target catalysts [27]. However, it is a desire to further enhance the sintering resistance of noble metals due to the increasingly stringent emission regulations. Besides, there is still disagreement on the effects of addition of Pt to Pd-supported catalyst on the catalytic activity for methane conversion. For instance, some works [23,28,29] reported that introducing amounts of Pt was an effective method to improve the activity of Pd/Al2O3. This positive effect could be ascribed to the prevention of the aggregation of Pd species and enhanced amount of active species. Nevertheless, the negative impacts have also been reported [30]. Natalia Semagina et al. [31] used in situ X-ray absorption technique to monitor the chemical state of Pd phase in Pd-Pt/Al2O3 during methane combustion. The authors found that the generation of metallic palladium species, a rather lower activity in comparison of palladium oxide, lead to inhibited activity. These discrepant conclusions for Pt effects possibly resulted from the different of catalyst synthesis parameters, catalyst history, and metal precursors, all of which may induce various fractions of metallic Pt and PdO [32]. In this work, the role of Pt in Pd nano-catalyst stabilized by MgAl2O4 spinel on alumina support for lean methane conditions was systematically investigated after harshly hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst was characterized by pulse CO chemisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). It can be found that platinum addition helps to maintain the intrinsic catalytic activity of Pd catalyst and significantly enhance the hydrothermal stability for lean methane combustion due to the interaction between Pt and active PdO crystallite and their properties of sintering resistance. This work may help to design highly efficient catalyst for methane elimination. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A commercial gama-alumina was pretreated in flowing air at 600 °C for 3 h (ramp: 5 °C/min). Magnesium was introduced into the gama-alumina support (5.00 g) by incipient wetness impregnation method [22,33] using magnesium nitrate (Sigma Aldrich) as magnesium precursor. The Mg2+ concentration and volume of the solution during the preparation was 5.0 mL and 2.08 M. respectively, resulting in a Mg content of 5 wt%. The powder was heated at 110 °C for 10 h, and then calcined in flowing air at 950 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The resulting Mg-Al2O3 support was denoted as M-A. The formation of magnesia-alumina spinel was confirmed by powder XRD technique (see Fig. 2). The Pd-only and Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using M-A as support. Pd(NO3)2 solution (Heraeus, 15.6 wt.%) and Pt(NO3)2 solution (Heraeus, 30 wt.%) were used as the precursors of Pd and Pt, respectively. The Pd2+ concentration and volume of the solution for the preparation of Pd-only catalyst was 5.0 mL and 0.705 M respectively. The Pd2+ concentration, Pt2+ concentration and volume of the solution for the preparation of Pd-Pt bimetallic catalyst was 0.113 M, 0.0156 M and 5 mL, respectively. A rotary evaporator was used to remove the solvent at 50 °C overnight. Prior calcination, the samples were heated in flowing air at 110 °C for 10 h. The catalysts were then heated in flowing air at 550 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The result catalysts were named as Pd/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A. The precious metal loading for these two catalysts was constant (1.5 wt%), and the mole ratio of Pd:Pt is 8:1. The actual metal loading was showed in Table 1 . In order to evaluate the hydrothermal stability of the as-synthesized catalysts for industrial application, the calcined samples were further aged at 750 °C for 12 h in a 20 % O2-10 % H2O atmosphere with a rate of 1280 mL/min [22]. This aged condition is in line with the literature [34]. The resulted aged catalysts were labled as Pd/Mg-A-a and Pd-Pt/Mg-A-a, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity measurements and kinetic analysis The catalytic behaviors of the catalysts were tested in a multiple fixed bed reactor. The test conducted at atmospheric pressure. The samples (100 mg, 40–60 mesh) were putted into the reactor (inside diameter: 5 mm, length: 40 cm) between two layers of quartz sand, which avoids the move of catalyst during measurement. The temperature of the samples was detected using a K-type thermocouple. A bank experiment under the same conditions was used to check the reliability of the reactor. The conversion of methane could be negligible in the testing temperature range of 200−500 °C when only quartz sand was placed in this reactor for the blank measurement. Each reaction gas was regulated with a mass flow controller. The reaction gas contains 1 vol% CH4, 20 vol% O2 and 79 vol% N2. The total gas flow rate was 200 mL·min−1. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) for the test was 120,000 mL gcat −1 h−1. Prior to the test, the catalysts were cleaned in flowing 20 vol% O2/He (200 mL·min−1) at 500 °C for 60 min and then cooled to 200 °C under the same gas conditions. The temperature was heated from 200 to 500 °C to acquire the conversion curves (light-off curves) of methane. The gas component of outlet reactor was continuously measured using a FTIR equipment. The spectrometer was corrected at 165 °C and 940 Torr, the working pressure of which was maintained using a pressure detector. CO was not observed in the outlet of reactor. CO2 selectivity was nearly 100 % over these catalysts in the present lean circumstance. The conversion of methane was estimated according to the Eq. (1): (1) CH4 conversion (%) = 100*(mol CH4, in – mol CH4, out)/ mol CH4, in where mol CH4, in and mol CH4, out were the content of CH4 at the inlet and outlet gas, respectively. With respect to kinetic analysis, CH4 conversion was kept below 15 % to eliminate the limitations of heat and mass transfer [6,35–37]. The reaction rates of CH4 conversion and TOF value was estimated using the Eq. (2) and (3), respectively. (2) rCH4 = (XCH4 * CCH4 * Vgas) /m (mol g noble metal −1 s−1) (3) TOF=rCH4 * M / D (s−1) Where XCH4 is the methane conversion; CCH4 is the methane concentration in feed gas; Vgas is the total gas rate (mol/s); m is the mass of noble metal (g); M is the mean molar mass of Pd (106.42 g/mol) and Pt (195.08 g/mol); D is the dispersion of noble metal determined from pulse CO-chemisorption (ca.). The apparent activation energy was calculated from Arrhenius plots. 2.3 Physicochemical characterization The samples were analyzed by varied kinds of measurements, such as N2 adsorption, XRD, pulse CO chemisorption, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, and CO-DRIFTS. The details were displayed in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical characteristic The physical feature of the as-synthesized catalysts was systematically investigated. Fig. 1 a presents the isotherms of N2 adsorption-desorption. The H1 hysteresis loop and type IV can be observed, which indicates the presence of a mesoporous structure over all the catalysts [40].As summarize in Table 1, the specific surface areas of the fresh samples are almost identical. After aging treatment, the BET surface area of Pd/M-A decrease from 102 to 89 m2/g, suggestive of a slight change in its pore structure. Under the same conditions, the surface area of Pd-Pt/M-A can be almost retained. From the BJH pore size distribution (Fig. 1b), the average pore diameters of Pd/M-A and Pd-Pt/MA both locate in ca. 19 nm regardless of aging treatment. The similar trend is also seen in the parameter of total pore volume. The results suggested that Pt introduction has no negative effects on the textual properties of the catalyst. Pulse CO chemisorption experiment was used to obtain the amount of CO-uptake and the metal dispersion. As seen in Table 1, the CO-uptake amount of Pd/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A is almost the same (∼65 μmol g−1 cat), indicating the near dispersion for the two fresh catalysts. It can be seen that the consumption of CO on Pd/M-A-a and Pd-Pt/M-A-a was 15.7 and 42.0 μmol g−1 cat, respectively. Moreover, during the aging treatment, the decrease in CO-uptake amount (75 %) for Pd/M-A-a is two times more than that (36 %) over Pd-Pt/M-A-a. This distinction can be clearly reflected on the calculated metal dispersion. The number of available active sties over the sample surface can be expressed by the active metal surface area (MSA), which is an important parameter for determining the catalytic performance [39]. Obviously, the active MSA (1.33 m2/g) over Pd-Pt/M-A-a is significantly higher than that (0.50 m2/g) over Pd/M-A-a. The results indicated that Pt addition can help to expose more active sites on catalyst surface and thereby Pd-Pt/M-A-a may present higher activity and hydrothermal stability. 3.2 Structural properties The structural properties of the catalysts before and after hydrothermal aging were measured by powder XRD technique. As displayed in Fig. 2a, for all the samples, the main peaks at 2θ = 31.8, 37.5, 45.6, and 66.3° can be respectively ascribed to the characteristic diffraction (220), (311), (400), and (440) of MgAl2O4 spinel (PDF-87−0345). This confirms the formation of MgAl2O4 spinel over the catalysts during preparation. No diffraction peaks of metallic Pd and PdO species are detected in both Pd/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A, which could be due to the fact that the small palladium crystalline is under the detection limit (below 3−4 nm) of XRD instrument [41]. This reason could also explain the absent characteristic peak of Pt phase rationally over Pd-Pt/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A-a. However, there is obvious difference between the XRD patterns in Pd catalysts with and without Pt additive after hydrothermal aging. As shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.8 and 39.7° can be observed over Pd/M-A-a, and the peaks origin from the features of PdO (101) (PDF-41−1107) and metallic Pd (111) (PDF-87−0643), respectively. With the aid of the Debye-Scherer equation and the width at half maximum for the feature at 2θ = 33.8°, the average size of PdO particle over Pd/M-A-a is calculated to be up to 14.0 nm (Table 1). The observation indicates the significant sintering and agglomeration of PdO species. Moreover, the existence of metallic Pd suggested the decomposition of PdO phase without the anchoring effect of Pt additive. However, no apparent change is observed in XRD patterns between Pd-Pt/M-A-a and Pd-Pt/M-A. Particularly, the diffraction features of metallic Pd and PdO are both absent over Pd-Pt/M-A-a. Additionally, for Pd-Pt/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A-a, we cannot see any diffraction peaks corresponding to Pt-Pd alloy (Figure S1), which has a negative effect on the catalytic activity of lean methane combustion [30,31,37]. The Pt nanoparticles may be stabilized by MgAl2O4 spinel over the catalysts. However, small Pt-Pd alloy under the limitation of XRD experiments might present in the catalyst [27]. The result confirms that after Pt introduction, the agglomeration and decomposition of PdO active phase under severely hydrothermal conditions could be suppressed to a great extent. The structure and morphology of the fresh and aged catalysts were further analyzed by TEM measurements. The average metal diameter was estimated based on a spherical model by calculating more than 200 isolated particles. As shown in Fig. 3 , small and uniform metal nanoparticles are seen over the fresh samples, whereas the metal particle size (∼2.4 nm) of Pd-Pt/M-A is slight smaller than that (∼2.9 nm) of Pd/M-A. It can be clearly seen that these two catalysts both suffer from sintering under harsh hydrothermal treatment. However, the calculated metal particle size of Pd/M-A-a is up to 12.7 nm, which increases by 4.4 times by comparsion of that on Pd/M-A. Note that the estimated metal size of Pd-Pt/M-A-a is around 4.5 nm with the metal particle size increasing only by a factor of 1.9 times. These results are in good line with those of pulse CO chemisorption and XRD measurements. Thus, it provides adequate evidence that platinum as a structural additive can enhance the dispersion of palladium particle and hinder its agglomeration regardless of aging. In order to investigate the structure of Pt and Pd on the catalyst surface, HAADF-STEM and HRTEM measurements was carried out on Pd-Pt/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A-a. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . The present Pt and PdO crystalline in both samples have a respectively spacing of 0.24 nm and 0.265 nm, corresponding to Pt(111) and PdO (101), respectively. It can be found from EDS mapping images that for these two catalysts the signals of palladium and platinum with bright spots appear to be overlapped, indicating that Pt species is co-localized and in close proximity to PdO species. This observation could be confirmed by the HRTEM results, which shows that Pt locates on the near surface of PdO crystalline over the samples regardless of aging treatment. The strong interaction between Pt and PdO species may exist in the Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts. From this point, the lack of appreciable sintering of Pt and PdO nanoparticles could be benefited from this interaction, which may promote the catalytic activity and stability of methane elimination. 3.3 Chemical characteristic To investigate the chemical state of Pd species, the interaction between Pt and PdO, and the surface element composition, XPS experiments were performed on the catalysts. The scanning time and source for spectra was identical for all the catalysts (acquisition time: 330 s; source: 150 W). The square root of reduced X2 and a coefficient of determination R2 for the XPS fitting are showed in Table S1. The Pt 4f XPS peak is entirely overlapped by Al 2p peak because the location of the two peaks is almost the same and the amount of Pt is rather lower than that of Al in the present samples (Figure S2). This overlap makes it difficult to determine the state of Pt species. However, Pt might co-exist in Pt and PdOx over fresh and aged samples in the present experiment [19,27]. Specific attention was paid to the spectra of Pd 3d. The results are exhibited in Fig. 5 . For the fresh samples, the XP peaks of Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 at 341.3–341.8 and 336.1–336.6 eV, respectively, can be ascribed to Pd2+ [25]. It means that the chemical sate of Pd over the surface of the fresh samples presents completely in PdO phase. However, hydrothermal treatment leads to the appearance of two new peaks at ca. 334.9 and 340.2 eV over both Pd/M-A-a and Pd-Pt/M-A-a, and these peaks are assigned to less active Pd° phase [42]. It indicated the occurrence of PdO decomposition during the aging conditions. However, PdO are still the main Pd species over the aged samples since the peak area of PdO phase are higher than that of metallic Pd phase. Note that a positive shift (∼0.5 eV) of PdO 3d5/2 was observed over Pd-Pt/M-A compared with Pd/M-A. A similar trend for shift of binding energy was seen over in the aged samples. The results suggested the electron interaction between Pt and Pd in bimetallic Pd-Pt catalyst, in line with the measurements of HAADF-STEM and HRTEM, which shows the close proximity of these two noble metals. This shift might be ascribed to electron transfer from PdO to Pt species, resulting in a possibly changed environment around PdO phase [3]. In order to determine the relative concentration of metallic Pd and PdO over catalyst surface, the fitting of Pd 3d spectra was carried out using a Gaussian function. The estimated amount is presented in Table 2 . Compared to Pd/M-A-a, a slight higher amount of surface Pd/Al was observed Pd-Pt/M-A-a, suggestive of its better dispersion of Pd. This is well consistent with the results of XRD, CO-chemisorption and TEM. It should be noticeable that the surface relative concentration of Pd0 phase (34 %) over Pd/M-A-a is nearly 5 times than that (7%) over Pd-Pt/M-A-a. It provides a clear evidence that Pt has an ability to suppress the sintering and decomposition of PdO possibly via the interaction with active PdO species. Thus, Pd-Pt/M-A-a is capable of offering more available PdO-active sites for C–H activation of methane and may present considerable catalytic activity and stability toward lean methane oxidation [16,19]. In order to further understand the role of Pt, CO-DRIFTS experiments were carried out. As showed in Fig. 6 , the IR band at ca. 2081 cm−1 could be ascribed to the linear adsorption of CO onto noble metal atoms on corners or edges with low coordination numbers [43,44]. The 1971 cm−1 IR band origins from bridged adsorption of CO on Pd(111) or Pd(100) facet [42,45]. Finally, the IR adsorption band in 1930−1700 cm−1 can be assigned to CO species adsorbed on hollow sites in Pd (111) facet or Pt particles [46]. Note that hydrothermal aging significantly decreases the intensity of CO adsorbed species on Pd/MA. However, under the same hydrothermal treatment, the intensity of the CO adsorption species on Pd-Pt/MA can be almost maintained. This observation suggests the promoted role of Pt additive on the stability of the catalyst again. 3.4 Catalytic activity and kinetics analysis The test of catalytic performance for lean methane combustion was performed. Fig. 7 a shows the light-off curves of methane conversion over fresh and aged samples. The low-temperature catalytic performance normally is expressed by the methane light-off temperature, corresponding to 50 % methane conversion. As summarized in Table 3 , the light-off temperature of methane for Pd/M-A and Pd-Pt/M-A is nearly identical (∼322 °C). However, after hydrothermal treatment, the methane light-off temperature for Pd/M-A-a shifts forward by up to 50 °C. On the contrast, the light-off characteristic can be nearly maintained over Pd-Pt/M-A-a, although its methane light-off temperature raised by ∼3 °C. The results indicated the significantly promoted effect of Pt additive on the hydrothermal stability of Pd catalyst. This improvement is likely due to the preservation of active PdO species, which is benefited from the interaction of PdO with Pt. The normalize reaction rate of methane conversion as a function of temperature is presented in Fig. 7b. The methane elimination rate over Pd-Pt/M-A can be retained but that over Pd/M-A is lower remarkably after suffering from hydrothermal aging. Particularly, as shown in Table 3, the reaction rate (2.7 × 10−5 molCH4 gnoble metal -1s-1) at 260 °C over Pd-Pt/M-A-a is about 13 times more than that (0.2 × 10−5 molCH4 gnoble metal -1s-1) over Pd/M-A-a, which confirms the better hydrothermal stability over the modified samples again. TOF was estimated using the methane conversion below 15 % where the mass and heat transfer limitation could be negligible [6,35–37]. The TOF value (1.1 × 10-2 s-1) at 260 °C of Pd-Pt/M-A-a is about 15 times higher than that (0.07 × 10-2 s-1) of Pd/M-A-a. A similar trend is also seen at 290 °C. The result indicates that higher intrinsic catalytic activity exists in Pd-Pt/M-A-a. In order to further elucidate the distinct of catalytic performance over the samples, kinetic analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 7c, a lower apparent activation energy (Ea) of methane oxidation is observed over Pd-Pt/M-A-a in comparison of Pd/M-A-a (ca. 119 versus 188 kJ/mol). Generally, the catalyst with lower Ea value can activate methane molecule much easier [52], in good agreement with higher TOF value in Pd-Pt/M-A-a [47]. The larger Ea value in Pd/M-A-a is associated with its higher concentration of surface Pd0, a rather less active for lean methane combustion [50]. More specially, during the aging treatment, the increase in Ea over Pd/M-A is up to 69 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than that (2 kJ/mol) over Pd-Pt/M-A. All of these results clearly demonstrate that Pd-Pt bimetallic nano-catalyst can maintain its intrinsic catalytic activity for lean methane combustion during severely hydrothermal treatment and present significantly enhanced hydrothermal stability. 3.5 General assessment The promoted impacts of platinum on the hydrothermal stabilization of Pd catalyst have been confirmed by varied means of characterizations. Let us note that the increased specific rate and TOF value on Pd-Pt/M-A-a reveals the interaction between Pd and Pt contributing to its enhanced catalytic activity. XPS investigation also supplies additional essential information by the estimation the ratio of surface PdO/(PdO + Pd). A much more concentration of surface PdO active phase is seen over Pd-Pt/M-A-a, which can be related to the interaction of PdO with Pt species. This interaction has been previously reported for the enhanced catalytic activity of diesel emission control. Datye and co-worker[51] investigated the chemical state of Pt/Al2O3 aged at 750 °C for 10 h in 20 %O2 and found that Pt grows speedily to generate large metallic Pt particles because of its lower vapor pressure and lack of strong metal-support interaction. Besides, treating Pt-Pd/Al2O3 and a physical mixture of Pd/ Al2O3 and Pt/ Al2O3 in abovementioned conditions lead to the formation of Pt-Pd alloy. In the present work, however, no X-ray diffraction patterns corresponding to Pt species including metallic Pt, PtOx and Pt-Pd alloy can be seen over PdPt/M-A before and after hydrothermal treatment. This may be due to the fact that the formed magnesia-alumina spinel could stabilize Pt species and hinder their agglomeration, which can be confirmed by the results of TEM and in situ DRIFTS (Figure S3−4). Fig. 8 shows the possible steam deactivation over the samples after severely hydrothermal treatment. As revealed by HRTEM and XPS, the Pt species anchor on the surface of active PdO phase via the electron interaction between them (Fig. 5). Consequently, there is a lack of appreciable sintering of Pt and PdO species (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Indeed, PdO particle size (4.5 nm) over Pd-Pt/M-A-a is smaller than that (12.7 nm) over Pd-Pt/M-A-a (Table 1). As a matter of fact, previous investigations exhibited the volcano type curves of catalytic activity with increasing Pd particle size revealing the optimal particle size to be 4−5 nm [13]. Furthermore, a considerably higher concentration of active PdO is observed over Pd-Pt/M-A-a compared with Pd/M-A-a (93 atm. % vs 66 atm. %) (Table 2). However, without such Pt promotion, PdO on the surface of Pd/M-A sinters dramatically and decomposes to large metallic Pd particle (∼15.2 nm), which normally is considered to be less active for lean methane combustion. Due to more accessible PdO active sites, lower Ea value along with higher intrinsic catalytic activity can be obtained over Pd-Pt/M-A-a, thereby presenting higher hydrothermal stability (Table 3 and Fig. 7). 4 Conclusions In summary, a Pd-Pt bimetallic nano-catalyst on gama-alumina modified by magnesia-alumina spinel was prepared using a facile doping strategy. The effects of platinum on the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of Pd catalyst were systematically studied by XRD, HAADF-STEM, HRTEM, XPS, and CO-DRIFTS experiments. Pt species may be stabilized by magnesia-alumina spinel. Besides, the electron interaction between Pt and Pd can stabilize Pd species in active PdO and hinder the agglomeration and decomposition of active PdO to less active Pd°. With the aid of this interaction, the structure of Pd-Pt bimetallic catalyst is maintained and the sintering of Pt and Pd nanoparticles is suppressed to a great extent during severely hydrothermal treatment. Indeed, this aged catalyst presents a stabilized intrinsic catalytic activity (2.7 × 10−5 molCH4 gnoble metal -1s-1 at 260 °C) for lean methane combustion and shows enhanced hydrothermal stability, whereas a significant deactivation is observed over the aged analogous sample without Pt promotion. This work is likely to guide the design of highly efficient emission catalyst for environmental control.

        "dc:description": "It is an urgent desire to decrease release of methane, a potential greenhouse gas, over methane-oxidation catalysts. However, the commonly used Pd-based catalysts normally suffer from poor hydrothermal stability. Here, we report a Pd-Pt bimetallic nano-catalyst stabilized by magnesia-alumina spinel via a facile doping strategy for lean methane combustion. The promoted effects of platinum on the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst are confirmed by XRD, HRTEM, STEM, XPS, CO-DRIFTS characterizations. Pd-Pt bimetallic catalyst can almost maintain its intrinsic catalytic activity (2.7 × 10−5 molCH4 gnoble metal -1s-1 at 260 °C) after harshly hydrothermal aging, while the aged analogous sample without Pt promotion presents remarkably reduced catalytic performance with an increment in CH4 light-off temperature of ca. 50 °C. Kinetic analysis further reveals a much higher turnover frequency (0.011 s-1 at 260 °C) and lower apparent activation energy (119 kJ/mol) of CH4 oxidation on the aged Pd-Pt bimetallic samples. Pt stabilized by magnesia-alumina spinel has a strong interaction with PdO. This interaction could stabilize Pd species in active PdO and also suppress the decomposition of active PdO to less reactive Pd°. Consequently, the sintering resistance of Pt and PdO crystallite and the electron interaction between them could be responsible for the enhanced hydrothermal stability.",
