Colloidal synthesis method such as oleylamine (OAm)-stabilized process is of great interest for obtaining uniform and highly dispersed platinum nanoparticle catalysts, yet the ligand may unavoidably inhibit their electro-catalytic performance. Thus, fully removing these ligands is critical to activate catalyst surface. Previous research of OAm removal process pointed that thermal annealing was the most effective way in comparison with other methods such as chemical washing, UV–Ozone irradiation and cyclic voltammetry sweeping, but generally resulting in undesired growth of platinum nanoparticle. Few studies concerning a more efficient ligand removal process have been published yet. In this work we proposed a platinum in-situ catalytic OAm combustion strategy to elucidate the removal mechanism of OAm ligands in thermal process and the key experimental parameters were also optimized. In addition, heat flow signal based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement as a sensitive indicator, is suggested to reveal the ligand removal efficiency, which is much more reliable than the traditional spectroscopy. In comparison with commercial Pt/C sample, such a surface clean Pt/C electrocatalyst has shown an enhanced specific activity for oxygen reduction reaction. Our removal strategy and the evaluation method are highly instructive to efficient removal of different organic ligands.

Keywords Ligand removal Platinum in-situ catalytic OAm combustion Carbon supported platinum electro-catalyst ORR 1 Introduction Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), characterized by high energy conversion efficiency and environmental friendliness, are regarded as one of the most promising application in civilian and military fields [1–4]. Development of high performance carbon supported electro-catalysts is one of the major steps for the commercialization of PEM fuel cells [5–8]. In recent years, many researchers proposed that size and shape controlled platinum and platinum based binary nanoparticles can be obtained in a typical OAm-stabilized colloidal method by rapidly injecting metal precursor into OAm solvent [9–12]. The –NH2 functional groups of OAm molecule have high affinity with platinum, resulting in the formation of a stable [Ptn+-OAm] complex [13]. The [Ptn+-OAm] complex can be further reduced to stable platinum colloid nanoparticle covered with OAm on surface, avoiding agglomeration [14]. Recent numerous works indicate that OAm-stabilized platinum colloid is beneficial to obtain uniformly distributed platinum nanoparticle on solid support, however, the OAm ligand will mask the metal particle surface and jeopardize electrochemical reactions by blocking the adsorption and electron transfer of reactant molecules [15]. For the practical application of platinum colloids in electro-catalysis, it is necessary to remove ligands capped on the particles, and the complete removal of OAm ligands without compromising the nanostructure and property of the nanomaterial is a challenging work. Recently, various physical and chemical methods [16–21] have been developed for the removal of OAm ligand and synthesis of a surface clean platinum nanoparticle catalyst. Niu and Li [22] made a detailed review on the ligand removal and utilization for some inorganic nanoparticles. The repeatable solvent washing procedure is usually adopted as a routine procedure for the freshly lab-prepared colloidal nanoparticles, but it does not work for unsupported nanoparticles less than 5 nm because the nanoparticle in this size region is difficult to precipitate under regular centrifugation during the washing treatment. Some solid supports need to be introduced to promote the sedimentation of nanoparticles, which brings new challenges to ligand removal. Humphrey et al. [18] assessed the efficacies of several ligand removal methods, including chemical solvent washing and thermal pre-treatment procedures in regard to nanoparticle surface changes, and the impact of their electro-catalytic properties with regards to HCOOH and surface-adsorbed CO (COads) oxidation in acidic solution. It is shown that thermal annealing treatment in H2 or Ar atmosphere at moderate temperatures (300–400 °C) is highly effective for OAm removal. Liu et al. [20] also carried out a series of tests to explore the efficacies of ligand removal for OAm-stabilized platinum nanoparticles and they found that platinum nanoparticles could be activated by thermal treatments in the air at 185 °C, but the UV/ozone treatment did not work. Up to now, thermal treatment seems to be the most effective strategy for ligand removal, although it possibly induces the sintering of particles, causing the loss of surface area and consequently the degradation of catalytic activity. On the premise that ensuring the effective removal of ligands, how to minimize changes of particle morphology and maintain the best catalytic activity is the main purpose for heat treatment strategy of OAm removal. In order to achieve the above target, two basic questions need to be resolved. Firstly, a simple and sensitive method for the evaluation ligand removal efficiency should be established. Secondly, the removal mechanism of OAm ligands during heat treatment must be revealed in order to better design and optimize the key parameters. In this study, heat flow signals based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement were proposed as a sensitive indicator to track the presence of OAm ligands, even if the amount of OAm is very weak. Combined with TEM (Transmission electron microscopy), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), TG (Thermogravimetric) and XPS (X-ray photo-electron spectra) techniques, the removal mechanism of OAm on carbon supported platinum nanoparticles in different atmospheres is explored and revealed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Pt/C nanoparticles synthesis The synthesis of carbon supported platinum colloid nanoparticles was adapted from the literature [23]. The whole synthesis procedure was carried out in N2 atmosphere. At first, 94.4 mg platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2, Xi'an catalyst chemical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in a solution with tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, 97%, Aladdin) and oleylamine (OAm, 80%–90%, Aladdin) to form [Ptn+-OAm] complex solution. Subsequently, 189.8 mg carbon support (Vulcan XC-72R, Cabot Corp.) was added into above [Ptn+-OAm] complex solution. Then, a mixture solution containing 4.0 mL oleylamine, borane tert‑butylamine complex (TBAB 88.8 mg, 95%, Aladdin), and tetralin (36.0 mL) was stirred vigorously for 10 min and injected into [Ptn+-OAm] complex solution later. The temperature was raised to 200 °C and maintained for 6 h. When the reaction was complete and cooled at room temperature, 5 mL ethanol (99.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd) was added to obtain Pt/C sedimentation at the bottom of vessel. The solid Pt/C sample was dried in a vacuum (60 °C) overnight and denoted as Pt/C-OAm. In addition, different OAm-modified samples including XC-72 carbon support, commercial Pt/C, commercial platinum black were also prepared by a similar procedure with above Pt/C-OAm sample, named as C-OAm, Commercial Pt/C-OAm, Commercial Pt black-OAm, respectively. 2.2 Platinum-catalyzed oleylamine combustion removal In a tube furnace, the samples were heated under different atmospheres (oxidative or inert gas) to a certain temperature at 5 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for 1 h. Pt/C samples experienced different ligand removal strategies are donated as a defined format like M–X ((M stands for OAm-modified carbon support (C-OAm) or OAm-modified catalyst (Pt/C-OAm) and X represents different clean protocols, like washing times, temperature and atmosphere). For comparison, other OAm containing samples like C-OAm will also experience the similar procedure. 2.3 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were carried out with JEOL JEM-2100 operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and Nano Measurer software was used to measure particle diameter. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on RIGAKU Miniflex600 X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 15 mA. The XRD patterns were collected by in a step scanning mode over 2θ angle between 10° and 90° at a scan speed of 5 °/min. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on SDT-Q600 (TA Corp., USA). Noticeably, to eliminate mass loss caused by the adsorbed water, all samples in TG/DSC characterization were dried for 1 h at 110 °C, and then cooled to 85 °C under a dry nitrogen atmosphere before thermal analysis. This ensures all weight loss in Pt/C-OAm samples is ascribed to OAm and carbon support combustion oxidation rather than water desorption. Thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) results were obtained on a PE Diamond TG/DTA, coupled to a mass spectrometer Thermo Star. Pt/C catalyst was heated to 700 °C at 10 °C/min under helium or air atmosphere using a flow rate of 100 mL/min while monitoring ion currents for various m/z fragments between 12 and 63. The presence of OAm at the Pt particle surface was also monitored by Fourier Transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR) using Thermo Nicolet 6700. The spectrometer was used in the transmission mode between 3400 and 1450 cm−1. X-ray photo-electron (XPS) spectra was used to check whether oleylamine has been removed from particle surface after different treatments. The spectra was done on ThermoFisher ESCALAB250xi. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode. Meanwhile, ca. 50 µg/cm2 catalyst films were loaded on freshly polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 0.19625 cm2) as a working electrode, and then dried under ambient conditions. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in N2 saturated perchloric acid aqueous solution (HClO4 aq., 0.1 M) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s and the electrode potential was between 0.05 and 1.2 V. The polarization curves for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were recorded in an oxygen saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution between the same scanning ranges with an electrode rotation speed of 1600 rpm and sweep rate of 20 mV/s. For comparison, 1 mg 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts (Johnson Matthey) were measured under similar conditions. All potentials given were calibrated versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). 2.5 DFT calculation The spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed by the DMol3 code embedded in Materials Studio [24]. The generalized gradient approximation with the PW91 [25] functional was employed to describe exchange and correlation effects. The all electrons core treat method was implemented. The double numerical atomic orbital augmented by a polarization function is chosen as the basis set [26]. During geometrical optimization, the basis set cut-off was chosen to be 5.2 Ǻ. The convergence tolerances for the geometry optimization were set to 10−5 Ha for the energy, 0.002 Ha/Ǻ for the force, and 0.005 Ǻ for the displacement. The electronic SCF tolerance was set to 10−6 Ha. A Fermi smearing parameter of 0.005 Ha was used in the calculations. The reciprocal space was sampled with a 4 × 4 × 1 and 5 × 2 × 1 k-points grid generated automatically using the Monkhorst–Pack method [27] for the relaxation calculations of Pt(111) (three layers p(4 × 4) slab) and rectangular graphene with single atom vacancy (p(5 × 7) slab), respectively. More than 35 Ǻ thick vacuum was added to avoid the artificial interactions between oleylamine adsorbed Pt/graphene and its images. In all of the structure optimization calculations, all the atoms are fully relaxed except the bottom layer of Pt(111). The binding energies (ΔE b) between oleylamine molecules and Pt/graphene substrates are calculated as follow, Δ E b = E mole − slab − E slab − E mole where E mole-slab, E slab and E mole are the total energies of the oleylamine adsorbed Pt/graphene systems, Pt/graphene slab and an isolated oleylamine molecule, respectively. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the typical TEM image and XRD pattern of the as-prepared Pt/C-OAm without intentional ligand removal and it can be found that platinum nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the support surface. The average particle size is ca. 2.6 ± 0.4 nm and no obvious particle agglomerations are observed. XRD pattern shows that the major diffraction peaks of both the Pt/C-OAm and commercial Pt/C catalyst are centered around 39.6°, 46.1°, 67.4°, 81.2°, and 85.6°, corresponding to the reflection planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222), which are consistent with the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of platinum (JCPDS Card No. 04-0802). Based on TEM and XRD results, we conclude that highly dispersed Pt/C sample can be successfully synthesized through our modified OAm-stabilized colloidal process. As we all know, infrared technique is a common method to detect the functional groups of organic ligands, and thermal analysis (TG/DSC) [28] is a thermoanalytical technique that is sensitive to monitor the heat flow of endothermic or exothermic process of a few samples. Subsequently, we employed infrared technique and DSC measurements to investigate the effect of conventional solvent washing on ligand removal efficiency. The infrared spectra of the supernatant as a function of washing times in solvent washing process are shown in Fig. 2 (a). In comparison with the FTIR spectrum of OAm in the published literature [29], we learn that the peaks at 2853 cm−1 and 2923 cm−1 should be ascribed to CH stretching vibration of OAm ligands. It can be clearly seen that no more infrared characteristic peaks associated with OAm can be observed in the supernatant after at least five times washing, which seems to indicate that OAm in the sample has been completely removed. In contrast, we further performed thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DSC) on our Pt/C-OAm samples after different solvent washing times in Fig. 2(b). Coupled with Figs. 2(b) and 3 , the attribution of heat flow peaks was first discussed. Unlike the OAm combustion occurs at ca. 200–500 °C and the heat flow of carbon oxidation appears at ca. 500–700 °C for C-OAm sample, the onset temperature of both OAm combustion (ca. 120–300 °C) and carbon oxidation (ca. 350–500 °C) for Pt/C-OAm shift to lower temperature since platinum could catalyze the combustion of oleylamine and accelerate carbon decomposition in carbon-supported Pt catalysts. With the increment of solvent washing times, we observed a steadily decrease in the onset temperature of first heat flow region (ca. 120–300 °C) and the peak area of heat flow becomes smaller in Fig. 2(b), indicating that the OAm content of our Pt/C-OAm sample is gradually decreased. It is worth mentioning that the first heat flow signal of Pt/C-OAm-9 wash can still be observed, indicating ligand residuals still remain on the sample surface even though catalyst experienced 9 washing times. Such inconsistent between FTIR spectra and TG/DSC analysis in Fig. 2 helps us assume that the infrared method is unreliable for detecting OAm removal and a subsequent thermal treatment is essential to remove organic ligands. Considering the difference combustion temperatures of OAm and carbon support with or without Pt catalyst in Fig. 3, we proposed an in-situ platinum-catalyzed OAm combustion removal strategy for carbon supported Pt electro-catalyst. Due to the atmosphere and temperature are two key factors that will affect OAm removal efficiency and the morphology of Pt nanoparticle, we investigated heating programs by TG-MS measurements with rising up temperature gradually to 700 °C (Fig. 4 ). When the data was collected in helium atmosphere, there is no significant MS signal below 400 °C although accompanied with obvious weight loss. The tiny signals of 12 (C), 15 (CH3 +), 29 (C2H5 +), 44 (CH3CHNH2 +), 45 (C2NH7 +) related to OAm species can only be detected when the temperature is higher than 400 °C, indicating OAm molecules begin to degrade in an inert gas. Alternatively, when Pt/C-OAm sample is exposed to an oxidative environment, the main peak of m/z 12 (C), 17 (OH−), 18 (H2O), 44 (CO2), 45 (HCO2 +) and a broad MS peak for m/z 46 (NO2) related OAm combustion can be clearly observed under a much low temperature range around 150–250 °C. The obvious MS signals of CO2, NO2, H2O at low temperature mean that heating in oxidative atmosphere will be a more suitable candidate than that in Ar. That is because mild temperature in the air will not only ensure minimum destroy for the morphology of catalyst but also allow for OAm molecules to be oxidized to gas instead of other by-products, which is promising to realize a clean surface catalyst. Electrochemical voltammetry technique, a well-known sensitive surface probing method, is beneficial to detect if the outer surface of Pt catalysts is covered by ligands for catalysts experienced our platinum in-situ catalytic OAm combustion and to further balance the relationship between surface cleanness, morphology and electrochemical performance by optimizing the thermal temperature. Based on the electrochemical data in Fig. S1, poor activities in CV curve and ORR polarization for Pt/C-OAm-100 °C-Air and Pt/C-OAm-150 °C-Air lead us to speculate that there is still residual oleylamine bound to particle surface. Simultaneously, higher temperature at 220 °C is also infeasible because of low ORR activity caused by larger particle size, which is evidenced by TEM images (Fig. S2). Compared with the above mentioned samples, Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air presents most optimum performance in aspects of CV and ORR curves. Moreover, our sample possesses a mass activity (MA) of 256.5 mA/mgPt at 0.9 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 5 ), which is close to that of commercial Pt/C (252.2 mA/mgPt), and the specific activity (SA) value for our Pt/C catalyst (0.34 mA/cm2 Pt) is about 1.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.25 mA/cm2 Pt). Our measured ORR activity of commercial Pt/C agrees well with the values reported in the literature [30]. The origins of the significantly enhanced SA value of Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air can be ascribed to the ligand-free platinum surface through our proposed advanced ligand removal strategy. Next, to further shed light on removal efficiency and mechanism, TG/DSC, XPS characterization and DFT calculation were carried out for Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air. Firstly, when the reaction is carried out in an oxidizing atmosphere in Fig. 6 (a), heat flow that is ascribed to carbon oxidation instead of OAm combustion cannot be identified until heating to 400 °C, indicating low temperature heat treatment in the air is an effective removal method to achieve ligand-free Pt catalyst surface. Furthermore, we have noticed, most surprisingly, that too much OAm in the sample may cause an uncontrollable burning accident in our platinum in-situ catalytic OAm combustion removal process, which is responsible for the catastrophic destruction on the property and morphology of Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S3). That is because the large amount of heat derived from oxidation of the surfactant may induce an abrupt temperature raise in a limited space. It suggests that sufficient solvent washing must be performed before the heat treatment and we found that OAm content should be less than about 4%–5% (Fig. S4), providing guarantees for annealing at aerobic environment in low temperature successfully. Secondly, Pt 4f XPS spectra of these catalysts in Table 1 shows that the bonding energy values of Pt0 species in Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air is consistent with that of commercial Pt/C (this value is also identical with the value published in literature [31]), verifying a good agreement with the observation from Figs. 4 and 5 that heat treatment in the air at low temperature is sufficient to clean catalyst surface thoroughly. In addition, the XPS signal of N 1s related to OAm in Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air is also shown in Fig. 6(b) and the trace N 1 s peak of Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air is present. This funding is unexcepted but suggested there may exist difference for OAm absorbed on Pt catalyst and carbon support. Thus, DSC curves and DFT calculation were also discussed below. Apparent heat flow in the range of 250–400 °C ascribed to the oleylamine oxidation in Fig. S5 appears even C-OAm sample has treated by annealing in the air at 185 °C. In addition, we used defective graphene to simulate the carbon support of Pt/C-OAm catalyst to simplify the calculation. Several other configurations were explored but were found to be less favorable and the final optimal model is shown in Fig. S6. As can be seen in Table S1, the calculated binding energy (E b) of OAm on Pt (111) is –1.23 eV, however, the defective graphene surface displayed a higher binding energy with OAm (–1.42 eV). This suggests that oleylamine has a stronger adsorption on carbon than Pt (111) surface. Consequently, residual OAm bonded on carbon support is much stronger than that on Pt (111) surface under the help of chemical washing and those far from Pt catalyst in distance can never be catalytically combusted due to the absence of Pt. A relevant point worth mentioning is that the reason why this weak amounts of OAm cannot be captured by DSC technique and displayed in heat flow. By analyzing DSC curves in Figs. 2(b), 3 and S5, it is not hard to discover that the onset temperature (ca. 200–500 °C) of OAm combustion on carbon in the absence of Pt atoms will coincide with that (ca. 350–500 °C) of carbon oxidation catalyzed by Pt, thus there exists common part in heat flow for OAm combustion and carbon oxidation. In this case, the oleylamine on the carbon support but away from the platinum atom can never be captured by DSC technique and presented in heat flow curves, coinciding with flat heat flow at ca. 200–500 °C in Fig. 6(a) and the trace N1s peak in Fig. 6(b) for Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air sample. 4 Conclusions In summary, we outlined a ligand removal mechanism to successfully remove OAm ligands and activate nanoparticles for electrocatalytic reactions while leaving the size and morphology of the supported particles unchanged. Specially, we systematically investigated various variables such as solvent washing times, thermal temperatures and atmospheres on the removal efficiency and those conditions are optimized to give the best performance for OAm-coated Pt/C nanoparticles. Multi-washing process ensures the residual oleylamine adsorbed onto the particle surface is less than 4%–5%, providing guarantees for annealing at aerobic environment in low temperature. The results show that the best performance is achieved by chemical washing prior to thermal treatment and the specific activity of Pt/C-OAm-185 °C-Air reaches 0.34 mA/cm2 Pt at 0.9 V, which is superior to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.25 mA/cm2 Pt). Meanwhile, in terms of the high precision and sensitivity of DSC technique, for the first time, we suggest the heat flow signal as a sensitive indicator to monitor the ligand removal efficiency through a temperature-dependent Pt catalytic organic ligands combustion process. Our ligand removal process is a promising way for future research for other electro-catalysts. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the financial support by DICP Grant no. ZZBS201705.

        "dc:description": "Colloidal synthesis method such as oleylamine (OAm)-stabilized process is of great interest for obtaining uniform and highly dispersed platinum nanoparticle catalysts, yet the ligand may unavoidably inhibit their electro-catalytic performance. Thus, fully removing these ligands is critical to activate catalyst surface. Previous research of OAm removal process pointed that thermal annealing was the most effective way in comparison with other methods such as chemical washing, UV–Ozone irradiation and cyclic voltammetry sweeping, but generally resulting in undesired growth of platinum nanoparticle. Few studies concerning a more efficient ligand removal process have been published yet. In this work we proposed a platinum in-situ catalytic OAm combustion strategy to elucidate the removal mechanism of OAm ligands in thermal process and the key experimental parameters were also optimized. In addition, heat flow signal based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement as a sensitive indicator, is suggested to reveal the ligand removal efficiency, which is much more reliable than the traditional spectroscopy. In comparison with commercial Pt/C sample, such a surface clean Pt/C electrocatalyst has shown an enhanced specific activity for oxygen reduction reaction. Our removal strategy and the evaluation method are highly instructive to efficient removal of different organic ligands.",
