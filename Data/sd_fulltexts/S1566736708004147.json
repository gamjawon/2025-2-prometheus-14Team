Tel.: +81 774 38 3502; fax: +81 774 38 3508. Monodispersed flower-like titanate superstructure was successfully prepared by simple hydrothermal process without any surfactant or template. N2-sorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) observation of as-synthesized product revealed the formation of flower-like titanate with diameter of about 250–450nm and BET surface area (S BET) of 350.7m2 g−1. Upon thermal treatment at 500°C, the titanate nanosheets were converted into anatase TiO2 with moderate deformation of their structures. The as-prepared flower-like titanate showed high photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water splitting reaction. Moreover, the sample heat treated at 500°C exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than that of commercial TiO2 anatase powder (ST-01). Keywords Titania Flower-like Sphere Nanosheets Template-free Hydrothermal 1 Introduction Titania (TiO2) is an attractive semiconducting material due to its characteristic photochemical properties and high chemical stability [1]. Applications of TiO2 have been explored in different fields including optoelectronics [2], photocatalysts [3], photoelectrodes [4], lithium rechargeable batteries [5], and sensor devices [6]. Many studies in the fundamental and practical fields have been performed using nanoscale materials, because a high specific surface is generally required for their applications [1]. In addition, many different methods and techniques have been developed for the preparation of TiO2 nanomaterials, including sol–gel technique [7], micelle and inverse micelle methods [8], solvothermal method [9], chemical vapor deposition [10], electrodeposition [10], hydrothermal method [11], etc. In contrast to other techniques, the hydrothermal method offers an inexpensive and environmentally friendly route and the ability to control chemical, homogeneity, purity, morphology, shape, and phase composition of the powder under moderate conditions [12–14]. Since it is known that the structural, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of TiO2 nanomaterials are strongly depended on their size, shape, and crystal structure, several attempts have been paid on the preparation of special morphologies of TiO2 nanostructure, such as nanotube [15], nanowire [16], hollow nanosphere [17], nanosphere [18], nanosheets [1,19], due to the fact that the synthesis of these TiO2 nanomaterials offer fundamental scientific opportunities for investigating the influence of size and dimensionality of materials with respect to their properties. In our previous work, we have reported the synthesis of spherical TiO2 nanosheets (flower-like morphology composed of nanosheets) via simple hydrothermal synthesis using titanium butoxide as starting material [19]. Our results showed that this prepared spherical TiO2 nanosheets exhibit higher photocatalytic activity and efficiency for dye-sensitized solar-cell when compared to the commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (Ishihara ST-01 and Degussa P25). However, the TiO2 prepared by this method were not homogeneous in size with large diameter raging from 500nm to 2μm. So it is meaningful to develop a simple method to synthesize the spherical TiO2 nanosheets with homogeneous size at rather low temperature. In this work, we report a simple hydrothermal approach for preparation of spherical titanate nanosheets by a novel 2-step method combining the synthesis of spherical amorphous titania using controlled hydrolysis and formation of spherical titanate nanosheets by hydrothermal treatment in ammonia aqueous solution. The effects of hydrothermal treatment temperature and time are also investigated. The spherical titanate nanosheets can be easily converted into spherical TiO2 nanosheets by thermal treatment at 500°C. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of monodispresed amorphous TiO2 spheres Monodispersed amorphous spherical TiO2 particles were synthesized through controlled hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Ti-(OC3H7)4, 97%, Aldrich) in ethanol [13]. Typically, 100mL of ethanol was mixed with 0.4mL of 0.1M aqueous potassium chloride, followed by the addition of 2.2mL of TTIP at ambient temperature under stirring condition. The solution was mixed until a white precipitate appeared. The suspension was aged in a static condition for 24h in a closed container at room temperature (25°C). The powder (denoted as AS) suspended in the vessel was collected by filtration and dried at 60°C in air. 2.2 Preparation of titanate nanosheets Monodispersed spherical titanate nanosheets were prepared by hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution. An amount of 0.3g of AS was suspended in 60ml of ammonia solution (20ml of 28% ammonia solution, 40ml of distilled water, pH 12) in 80-ml Teflon-line stainless autoclave at 60, 80, 100, and 120°C with stirring condition for 12 and 24h. The obtained powder was then washed by distilled water and ethanol. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a powder diffractometer (Rigaku RINT-2100). The microstructure of the prepared materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6500FE) The nitrogen sorption isotherm and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area were determined by nitrogen adsorption method (BEL Japan, BELSORP-18 Plus). 2.4 Photocatalytic measurement The photocatalytic activity measurement was evaluated with H2 evolution from water splitting reaction. The procedure was basically the same as described in previous work [20,21]. The reaction was carried out in a closed gas-circulation system. The amount of 1g of sample was suspended in aqueous methanol solution (800mL distilled H2O, 80mL methanol) by means of magnetic stirrer in an inner irradiation-type photoreactor made of Pyrex glass. The mixture was purged by Argon gas (Ar) to remove the air dissolved in solution. The suspension was irradiated by a 450W high-pressure Hg lamp (Ushio UM-452) and cooling water was circulated through a cylindrical Pyrex jacket located around the UV light source to maintain the reaction temperature. The evolved gasses were periodically analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A, Molecular sieve 5A, TCD, Ar Carrier). 3 Results and discussion Generally, transition metal alkoxides are very reactive with moisture, heat, and light due to the presence of highly reactive alkoxy (OR) groups. In sol-gel processing of metal alkoxides, hydrolysis and condensation reactions occur so rapidly that uniform and fine particles are difficult to obtain. However, the use of bulky, branched alkoxy groups (such as TTIP) could reduce the hydrolysis rates as reaction rates decrease with the steric bulk of alkoxy ligands to favor the formation of fine particles with a more uniform size distribution. Another approach to retard the hydrolysis and condensation rates is the chemical modification of metal alkoxides with modified agent, such as alcohols and acids or bases [22]. In this work, spherical TiO2 nanoparticles were formed through a controlled hydrolysis of TTIP in ethanol [23]. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of AS and the samples hydrothermally prepared in ammonia solution for 24h at 60 to 120°C. No XRD pattern of AS was found, indicating the amorphous nature of the samples obtained by hydrolysis of TTIP. According to XRD measurement, the XRD data of hydrothermally treated samples prepared at ⩾80°C show a poorly crystalline titanate. The peak at around 2θ ≈9° indicated that titanate has a layer structure with an interlayer distance of ca.1.0nm. The broad peaks in the high-angle region were similar to the theoretically estimated diffraction peaks for layered titanate (NH4)2Ti3O7− x N x [1,24]. However, the peak cannot be clearly observed for the sample prepared at 60°C. Recently, Takezawa and Imai have reported the formation of layered titanate in the basic solutions [1,25]. According to their work, the layered titanates can be constructed by stacking of anionic TiO2 manolayers with the counter cations (NH4 + or Na+). However, almost the same amount of anionic species and cationic agents, and a basic condition above pH 8 are required for the formation of the titanates [25]. As mentioned above, the pH of ammonia solution used in our experiments was pH 12. Therefore, the pH of ammonia solution used was sufficient for the formation of the layered titanates. The morphologies of resulting samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2 gives the morphologies of AS. As shown in Fig. 2a, uniform, solid spherical particles were obtained after 24-h. The high magnification SEM image (Fig. 2b) shows that the surface of these spheres is relatively smooth with size of 250 to 450nm. Fig. 3 shows the high magnification SEM images of hydrothermally prepared samples prepared for 12 and 24h at 60to 120°C. After hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution, the size of these spheres was not changed too much. However, their surfaces became rough. Obviously, nanosheets structure could be observed for all samples prepared at temperature ⩾80°C (Fig. 3c–h). Our results showed that, for this preparation method, the hydrothermal temperature was a critical factor. As seen in Fig. 3c–h, nanosheet structure could be obtained for samples prepared at ⩾80°C. At 60°C, the nanosheet morphology could not be obtained in the sample prepared for 12h (Fig. 3a). However, the nanosheet structure could be observed for sample prepared for 24h (Fig. 3b). Therefore, it can be preferably concluded that the longer time or higher temperature was required in order to obtain nanosheet structure. Some physical properties of AS and flower-like titanate superstructure prepared at 120°C for 12h are listed in Table 1 . The specific surface area of the products obtained at 120°C, 12 was estimated to be about 350.7m2 g−1. Such a high value of the specific surface area suggests that the nanosheet structure provide high surface area. In addition, it has been reported that the interlayer spacing can provide an effective surface for the adsorption of nitrogen molecules [1]. The sample prepared at 120°C, 12h was then heat treated at 500°C to investigate the effect of treatment temperature. Upon thermal treatment at 500°C for 1h, the titanate nanosheets were converted into anatase TiO2 (Fig. 1f), with slightly deformation of their structures (Fig. 4 ). The anatase nanosheets exhibited specific surface area about 31.7m2 g−1, where the thickness of the sheets was estimated to be larger than 15nm from SEM images. Fig. 5 shows the UV–Vis spectra of AS, flower-like titanate and flower-like titanate calcined at 500°C which are compared with that of commercial Ishihara ST-01 (ST-01). The AS shows an absorption edge at around 380nm. This absorption value is significantly lower than that of ST-01 (390nm). The flower-like titanate sample exhibits a main absorption edge at 385nm and, in addition, a shoulder that extends above 430nm. Upon calcination of flower-like titanate at 500°C, the obtained TiO2 anatase (Fig. 1) shows an absorption edge at around 400nm. Preliminary measurement of photocatalytic activity was evaluated with H2 evolution from water splitting reaction under UV light irradiation. For comparison, the same measurement was also carried out on ST-01 sample as the reference. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of H2 evolved after 5h irradiation for ST-01was estimated to be 92μmolg−1. In case of AS, the amount of H2 evolved was estimated to be 72μmolg−1, which was lower than that of ST-01. This was expected because the AS possess amorphous phase which generally show lower photocatalytic activity when compared to crystalline TiO2 photocatalyst. The amount of H2 evolved was raised to be 342μmolg−1 when as-synthesized flower-like titanate was used. However, the imperfect crystallization from XRD spectra (Fig. 1) accompanying with amorphous phase, which favorably increase the probability of mutual e−/h+ recombination at both surface and bulk trap, contained to some extent in the as-synthesized flower-like titanate resulted in the decrease in H2 evolution rate after 2h of reaction (Fig. 6). The amount of H2 evolved was raised to be 588μmolg−1 when the flower-like TiO2 calcined at 500°C was used. This was due to the spherical TiO2 nanosheets calcined at 500°C has anatase structure which show highest activity when compared to other TiO2 phase [20,21,26]. Moreover, the UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 5) shows that the number of absorbed photon of flower-like TiO2 calcined at 500°C is larger than other samples. The results revealed that the use of the flower-like TiO2 with unique structure could promote great H2 evolution. In summary, this study provides a simple route for fabrication of flower-like titanate superstructure with uniform size under mild condition. In addition, we found that the hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution used in this study can also be applied to prepare other nanosheets-composed TiO2 materials, such as TiO2 nanowires and TiO2 nanowire arrays. The results will be reported and discussed in the forthcoming work. Furthermore, it is expected that the hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution could also be applied to other nanostructured materials. 4 Conclusion Monodispersed amorphous TiO2 spheres were prepared by controlled hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol. By applying the hydrothermal treatment in ammonia solution, flower-like titanate of desired morphology could be easily prepared from amorphous TiO2 spheres. In addition, it was obvious that temperature exerts a great influence on the structure of the products prepared by this method. Moreover, the titanate nanosheets could be easily converted into anatase TiO2 by calcination at 500°C. Preliminary photocatalytic activity measurement showed that the flower-like titanate superstructure show high photocatalytic activity due to their unique structure. Moreover, the sample heat treated at 500°C, which show anatase phase, exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than that of commercial TiO2 anatase powder (ST-01).
