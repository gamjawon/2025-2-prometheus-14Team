Addition of NH3 to the impregnating solution in an NH3/Cr ratio = 2 improves the number of active sites to 52 or 42% of the total chromium, respectively (at low chromium concentration; 0.074% Cr). The number of active sites and the reflectance spectra of the chromium(III) surface complex are very similar to those from the chromium(III) surface complex prepared from Cr(VI)/Cr(II). A dinuclear model of the active site of the chromium(III)/silica gel catalyst is proposed. Introduction In a recent paper, the author proved that chromium(III) on silica gel can be a highly active catalyst for the polymerization of efhylene [1]. The polymerization activity was indeed more than a hundred times better than for Cr(II) on silica gel, which is the active center of the industrially used Phillips catalyst (Cr(VI) on silica gel) [1, 2-4]. The Cr(III) on silica gel was prepared according to Naumann [5] by oxidizing Cr(II) on silica gel with HzO/Oz to Cr(III). The product was heated thereafter in vacuum to 800 C with a yield of 50% active sites per total chromium at low chromium concen- tration (0.074% Cr/SiO;) [1]. A simpler preparation method, impregnating the silica gel with a water solution of Cr(H20)6Cl3, was used by Przhevalskaya et al. [6] and by Myers and Lunsford [7]. The activation temperature used by Przhevalskaya et al. was too low (500 C), so that the polymerization activity was very low. When comparing the turnover numbers given by Myers and Lunsford [7] for their Cr(III)/Si02 catalyst with those from [I], similar values of roughly 20 (at 20 C, 100 kPa CyH^) are noticed after recalculation. This is a clear indi- cation that in the two different preparation procedures the same active species are formed. However, Myers and Lunsford found a surprisingly low number of active sites: ten times lower than observed in [1]. 0304-5102/86/S3.50 Elsevier Seouoia/Printed in The Netherlands 356 The present paper uses the simpler preparation method of the Cr(III)/ silica gel from a water solution of Cr(H20)6Cl3 with the aim to improve the number of active sites. According to the idea that active sites of the Cr(II) and Cr(III) on silica gel catalysts consist of dinuclear surface species [8], a dinuclear Cr(III) complex HOCr2(NH3)ioCl5 was also used for impregnating the silica gel. Experimental Silica gel 60 'Merck 7733' (spec. surface: 600 m2 g~1) was used as a support after purification with cone. HC1 to remove Fe, Ca and Na. Cr(H20)6Cl3 was a commercial p.a. product, and HOCr2(NH3)ioCl5 was prepared according to Linhard and Weigel [9]. C^fi^ had a purity of 99.7% and other gases used were purified by passing them through a Cr(II)/Si02 column. The polymerization measurements [1] and the recording and recalcula- tion of the diffuse reflectance spectra with the Kubelka-Munk function [10] have been described previously. The silica gel was impregnated with the chromium compounds by dis- solving them in water and adding the solution to the silica gel together with the necessary amount of the ammonia solution. Additional water was added so that the silica gel was completely covered by solution. The mixture was dried in air at 120 C with frequent stirring, and stored at room temperature. The catalyst was activated in a quartz tube under vacuum (10 Pa) by increas- ing the temperature in 100 C steps every 15 min to an ultimate temperature of 800 C. To avoid degradation of the catalyst, the polymerization and the first diffuse reflectance spectrum were performed without prior contact with any gas whatsoever (strict vacuum conditions). The chromium content of the silica gel was 0.074% Cr per g silica gel after vacuum heat treatment at 800 C. This concentration, with the spec. surface mentioned above, gives a surface concentration of 0.015 Cr atoms per nm2. The polymerization measurements were carried out with an initial pressure of 60 kPa and at 0 C, using 0.833 g of the catalyst diluted with 4 g silica gel. Results Polymerization measurements In some early experiments done with Cr(H20)6Cl3 impregnated samples, it was found that using acidified solutions (HC1) during impregnation de- creased the polymerization activity of the catalysts compared with neutral conditions. The same effect was more pronounced when impregnating with HOCr2(NH3)ioCl5. Only alkaline solutions using NH3 in water were therefore studied in more detail. 357 Pig. 1. Produced polymer and number of active sites of ethylene polymerization in relation to the NHs/Cr ratio in the impregnating solution during preparation of the catalysts with Cr(H20)<,Cl3 and HOC^NHahoClj. Figure 1 shows the amount of polymer produced by the catalyst vs. the ratio of ammonia to chromium in the impregnating solutions. The amount of polymer produced by the catalyst can be, under the present polymerization conditions, correlated to the number of active centers (see [1]). In Fig. 1, an increase in the number of active centers is observed for impregnation with CrtHaO^C^ from 34% of the total chromium in neutral solution to 52%, when a ratio of slightly more than 2 NHa to one Cr ion is used. The latter number of active sites is nearly identical to that observed previously [1] using the more troublesome preparation through Cr(VI) and Cr(II) devised by Naumann [5]. Increasing the NHa/Cr ratio to values > 2 again decreases the number of active sites to the same number as measured for impregnation with neutral solutions. In the case of the Cr(III) dimer HOQ^lS^ioCIs, one observes a dif- ferent influence of the alkaline impregnation (Fig. 1). The increase in the number of active sites is more pronounced, because the number of active sites at neutral conditions is much lower for the dimer (9%). After reaching 42% active sites at an NHs/Cr ratio of 2, the number of active sites is only changed in a minor respect, so that at higher NH3/Cr ratios, a higher number of active sites is observed for the dimer than for impregnation with the monomer Cr(III) complex (Fig. 1). The polymerization activity with ethylene reaches a maximum of 335 g (C2H4) (mmol Cr)\"1 (h)~1 (100 kPa)~1 for the monomer sample with the NH3/Cr ratio of 2.28. This gives the same turnover number as measured pre- viously [I], A decrease in the polymerization activity to 165 (same units as above) steeper than for the number of active sites in direction of the neutral solution was observed. 358 Fig- 2.

Other spectra from samples prepared from Cr(H20)fiCl3 as used in Fig. 1. Reflectance spectra of the Cr(III)/silica gel catalyst Figure 2 shows the reflectance spectra of the Cr(III) catalyst prepared from the monomer Cr(H20)6Cl3 and by Naumann's method (X in Fig. 2). The most important observation from Fig. 2 is that the spectrum marked X and the spectrum 'n = 2.28', which is the catalyst that gives the highest number of active sites in Fig. 1, have similarly intense peaks at 12 900 and at 42 000 cm\"1. A slight shift of the peak at 12 900 to 12 500 cm\"1 for the impregnation with the monomer is observed. The main difference between the two spectra is, however, the intensity decrease of the shoulder at 9500 and the peak at 23 700 cm~1. For the sample impregnated with the neutral solution (n = 0 in Fig. 2) the peak at 12 500 cm~1 has decreased considerably and a second maximum is observed at 14000 cnT1. The maximum at 23700 cm~1 is shifted to 22 700 cm~1 and the band at 42 000 to 45 000 cm~1. These differences may be explained by the presence of two different Cr(III) surface species: one dominating at high concentrations of catalytically active sites (Cr(III)-A) and the other at lower concentrations (Cr(III)-B). The first one appears to be more like that produced by Naumann's method, and has probably a higher polymerization activity (see above). Figure 3 shows the reflectance spectra prepared from the dimer Cr(III) complex (HOCr2(NH3)ioCls). As might be expected, the intensity of the peak at 12 500 cm~1 is not as high as for the monomer samples. What is important is that all three peaks decrease with decreasing numbers of active sites, and that the Cr(III)-B surface species (defined above) does not increase with a lower number of active sites. In conclusion, one may say that all three dif- 359 Fig. 3. Reflectance spectra of Cr(III)/silica gel catalysts under vacuum.

The spectra show that the Cr(III) surface species are indeed coordinatively unsaturated. This is also valid for the Cr(III) species from less active samples impregnated with the monomer Cr(III) complex (Cr(III)-B, Fig. 4). The sample with a higher number of active sites (Cr(III)-A, Fig. 5) is, as might be expected, very similar to that prepared by Naumann's method [11]. Discussion The intensity decrease in the peak at 12 500 cm\"1 with decreasing number of active sites, as can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, points to a correlation between these two groups of measurements. In Fig. 6 such a correlation is shown. The rather surprising result, that the straight line drawn through the points extrapolates to zero, means that the catalytically inactive part of the chromium has no, or a very low, adsorption in this part of the spectrum. The relatively large error margin of the points in Fig. 6 is mainly due to the very low chromium concentration of the catalysts. Myers and Lunsford [7] found only 4 to 7% active sites for a similar preparation with monomeric C^HaO^Clg in neutral solution, which is five to eight times less than noticed above. The slightly higher Cr concentration (0.11% Cr) and the lower spec. surface of their silica gel (300 m2 g~1) results in a higher surface concentration of the Cr (0.044 Cr nm~2). However, the lower surface concentration can only partly explain the difference in active sites. Samples with 0.5% Cr (0.1 Cr nm~2) showed active site concentrations ofll%[l]. 361 ACTIVE Cr[o/,) POLYMER (gl Fig. 6. Relation between intensity of the absorption peak at 12 500 cm\"1 of Cr(III)/silica gel catalysts and polymer produced, together with number of active sites during ethylene polymerization (0 from Fig. 3, X from Fig. 2). After determination of the turnover number of the Cr(II) on silica gel catalyst [I], it is now clear that Cr on silica gel forms two different catalyt- ically active species with Cr(II) and Cr(III) as active sites. The above results show that on starting with solution of monomeric (and dimeric) Cr(III) salts in water, large numbers of active sites are formed similar to that with prep- arations according to Naumann. In other words, it is not the preparation method that sets the absolute maximum of the number of active sites. This maximum is most likely determined by the distribution of silanol groups on the silica gel surface. A similar conclusion was drawn previously for Cr(II)/ silica gel [12]. On fully hydroxylised silica gel surfaces, a concentration of 4.6 OH groups per nm has been measured of which 3.2 are neighbours [5]. From this number it becomes clear that only a small portion of the OH groups is suitable for the formation of surface compounds, and an even smaller portion for the formation of the active sites of the Cr(III) catalyst. It has been established for some time that the catalytically active Cr(II) surface compound is coordinatively unsaturated [13 -16]. The same is true for the Cr(III) catalyst [5, 11, 17]. In the case of the Cr(II)/silica gel cat- alyst, evidence accumulates now in favour of a dinuclear surface complex as theJcatalytically active site [8,12]. Preparation of the Cr(III)/silica gel catalyst according to Naumann's method uses the dinuclear Cr(II) surface complex as an intermediate prep- aration step. Additional evidence for a dinuclear Cr(III) active site was found in the deterioration of the catalytic activity by moderate heat (120 and 200 C) in the oxidation step from Cr(II) to Cr(III) [1]. Further evidence for a dinuclear active species is provided by the above results. Dimeric Cr(III) complexes with Cr-O-Cr or Cr-OH-Cr bridges have been known for more than a hundred years. With a trivalent cation, three different ways of forming a surface compound are formally possible. The one involving three Si-O-Cr bonds cannot form a dimer with a Cr-O-Cr 362 bridge. The one with only one Si-O-Cr bond would be rather weakly bound to the surface. In conclusion, the best precondition for formation of a dimer should be a joining of Cr(III) by two bonds to the surface. As shown in Scheme 1, NH3 increases the possibility of ion exchange by formation of NH4\"*\" (A in Scheme 1). The NH3/Cr ratio of 2 is now interpreted as the for- mation of two such surface sites per Cr on neighbouring Si-0~ groups. How- ever, even this way only roughly half the number of the Cr(III) ions are catalytically active. A possible explanation would be the assumption that only a part of the surface Cr(III) ions formed by this reaction have the close position favourable to form a dimer as shown in Scheme 1 (B). At higher NH3/Cr ratios, the Cr(III) surface species with three Si-O-Cr bonds may become more dominant, and agglomeration of Cr(III) to the hydroxide might also be possible. Cr(III) oxide with relatively weak absorption bands may function as a Cr(III) 'dump' and so enable the relation between the absorption band at 12 500 cm\"1 and the number of active Cr(III) sites as shown in Fig. 6. In the case of the dimeric Cr(III) complex, the Cr-OH-Cr bridge is most likely destroyed in neutral solutions and the ammonia ligands prevent an early formation of the Cr-O-Cr bridge. The result of these reactions may be only one Si-O-Cr bond per Cr(III) and a low number of catalytically active Cr(III) sites. On reaching an NH3/Cr ratio of 2 in the alkaline impreg- nating solution, the Cr-OH-Cr bridge of the dimeric Cr(III) complex stays intact and the whole complex is now bonded at the same surface sites as the monomeric Cr(III) complex (C in Scheme 1). The author must admit that the present model of the catalytically active Cr(III) dimer is slightly different from that proposed previously [I], where a model with two Cr-O-Cr bridges was drawn. The present model, however, resembles the Cr(II) surface compound to a higher degree (also only one Cr-O-Cr bridge) and therefore makes it easier to imagine an initia- tion mechanism the same as that proposed earlier [1, 8].
