Graphical abstract Molecular iodine has been used as an efficient catalyst for an improved and rapid one-pot synthesis of 2,4,5-trisubstituted and 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles in excellent yields.

Keywords 2,4,5-Trisubstituted imidazoles 1,2,4,5-Tetra substituted imidazoles Molecular iodine As an important member of the five-membered ring heterocycles, imidazole moiety is present in a wide range of naturally occurring molecule [1]. Compounds with imidazole moiety have many pharmaceutical activities [2]. The biological importance of the imidazole ring system has made it a common structure in numerous synthetic compounds, such as fungicides [3], herbicides [3], plant growth regulators [4] and therapeutic agents [5]. Recently, the advances in green chemistry and organometallic chemistry have extended the boundary of imidazoles to the synthesis and application of a large class of imidazoles as ionic liquid and imidazoles [6] related N-heterocyclic carbenes [7]. Due to their wide range of biological, industrial and synthetic applications, these have recently received a great deal of attention. There are several methods reported in literature for the synthesis of imidazoles, such as hetero-cop rearrangement [8], four component condensation of aryl glyoxals, primary amines, carboxylic acids and isocyanides on wang resin [9], reaction of N-(2-oxo)amides with ammonium trifluroracetate [10], 1,2-amino alcohols in the presence of PCl5 [11], diketones, aldehydes, amine and ammonium acetate in presence of phosphoric acid [12], in acetic acid [13], organocatalyst in acetic acid [14] as well as H2SO4 [15], DMSO [16]. Many of the synthetic protocols for imidazoles reported above, suffer from one or more disadvantages, such as harsh reaction conditions, poor yields, prolonged reaction time period, use of hazardous and often expensive acid catalysts. Moreover, DMF and DMSO leads to complex isolation and recovery procedure. There are several efficient methods developed for the synthesis of imidazoles, which comprise the use of MW/silica gel [17], MW/silica gel/H-Y [18], MW/Al2O3 [19], MW/acetic acid [20], in DMF [21]. However, the use of high temperature, expensive instruments likes microwave and corrosive reagents limiting these methods. Thus, simple efficient and flexible protocol for the synthesis of imidazoles are still in need as there is a scope for further improvement towards milder reaction conditions, development of simple and inexpensive reagents, convenient procedures and higher product yields. In recent years, the use of molecular iodine as a catalyst has received considerable interest in different areas of organic transformations [22] to afford the product in good to excellent yields. Owing to several advantages, such as inexpensive non-toxic, eco-friendly nature, iodine has been used as a readily available catalyst in the investigation of different organic reactions [23]. Development of efficient, selective and eco-friendly methods for application in complex organic preparations is the ultimate goal of several research groups, including ours [24], so in continuation of our work here we wish to report the eco-friendly synthesis of highly substituted imidazoles by iodine catalyzed cyclo condensation of aromatic aldehyde, ammonium acetate, aniline and benzil. Different solvents were tried to standardize the reaction condition. Reaction goes well with I2/toluene, I2/acetonitrile, I2/dichloromethane and I2/ethanol, but we used only ethanol, which is relatively benign organic solvent. Moreover with ethanol, only aqueous work up is required where as in other solvents, we need hazardous solvents for extraction of products. Minimum amount of solvent was used only to facilitate the homogeneous stirring. Further investigation was carried out for catalytic evaluation of iodine for the best reaction conditions (Table 1 ). The increase in the quantity of iodine up to 50mol% not only increases the yield but also lessens the reaction time but results clearly indicate that even 5mol% of iodine is sufficient to catalyze the cyclocondensation. However, in the absence of iodine, the reaction did not yield any product even after 4h. In order to examine the effect of temperature, concentration of iodine was kept constant at 5mol% and the reaction was monitored at different temperature as compiled in Table 2 . At elevated temperature using 5mol% of iodine gave better results in terms of yield and reaction time. Among various conventional procedures for the synthesis of 2,4,5-triarylimidazole 4a–4h, molecular iodine was found to be more effective catalyst as nearly stoichiometric amount of ammonium acetate was used where as conventionally higher fold of ammonium acetate was required. Thus, this method is advanced with respect to the existing procedures. After optimizing the best condition for the 2,4,5-triarylimidazoles 4a–4h (Table 3 ), the generality and scope of the iodine catalyzed reaction was examined by selecting a four component synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetraarylimidazoles 6a–6h. As expected, excellent yields of product were generated under refluxing condition with 5mol% of iodine (Table 4 ). The structure of 6g was also confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography [25]. It can be observed from Tables 3 and 4 that the process tolerates both electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents on the aldehydes. The aryl group substituted with different positions of the aromatic ring has not shown much effect on the formation of the final product. Molecular iodine catalyzes the reaction as a mild Lewis acid. Molecular iodine is capable of bonding with the carbonyl oxygen increasing the reactivities of the parent carbonyl compounds. As shown in Scheme 1 , we give the likely mechanism. Iodine facilitate the formation of a diamine intermediate (I), which under mild acid catalysis of iodine condenses further with the carbonyl carbon of 1,2 diketone followed by dehydration to afford the iso-imidazole (II), which rearranges via [1,5] sigmatropic shift to the required imidazoles. The overall greenness of this reaction was high as minimum amount of environmentally benign ethanol was used during the course of reaction. Moreover, it is important to note that in all cases, imidazoles were precipitated on dilution of the reaction mixture with water and were isolated by a simple filtration. The dried product thus obtained showed a single spot on TLC and was pure enough for all practical purposes. In summary, this paper describes a simple and convenient method for the synthesis of Imidazoles. We have successfully developed an easy and efficient method to prepare a variety of tri substituted and tetra substituted imidazoles in the presence of catalytic amount of iodine. The catalytic activity of iodine is remarkable and the use of low cost, commercially available iodine as catalyst for the synthesis of imidazoles in excellent yields is also significant under the aspect of environmentally benign processes. The advantages, such as shorter reaction times, product yields, the easy procedure to carry out the reaction makes the inexpensive and commercially available iodine as a powerful catalyst for the synthesis of imidazoles. 1 Experimental 1.1 General Melting points were determined using a Thomas Hoover melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained on Perkin-Elmer FTIR-1710 spectrophotometer using Nujol film. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance Spectrospin at 300 and at 75MHz, respectively, using TMS as internal standard. Analytical TLC's were performed on pre-coated Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates; the spots were detected either under UV light or by placing in iodine chamber. Elemental analysis was performed on a Horeaus CHN Rapid analyzer. The temperature of the reaction mixture was measured through a non-contact infrared thermometer (AZ, Mini Gun type, model 8868). X-ray diffraction data was made on a Enraf-Nonius CAD4 Diffractometer (Fig. 1 ). 1.2 Synthesis 1.2.1 General procedure for the synthesis of 2,4,5-triarylimidazole 4a–4h A mixture of benzil 1 (10mmol), ammonium acetate 2 (20mmol), aromatic aldehyde 3 (20mmol) and iodine (5mol%) in 2ml of ethanol was stirred at 75°C for the appropriate time mentioned in Table 3. The completion of reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with water (having small amount of Na2S2O3). The solid imidazole products that separated out, were filtered, washed with water and dried. The crude products, thus obtained were pure and subjected to further purification by column chromatography of silica gel (60–120mesh size) using 25% ethylacetate in petroleum ether as eluent to yield 2,4,5-triarylimidazole 4a–4h. The structures of all the products were unambiguously established on the basis of their spectral analysis (IR, 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectral data). 1.2.2 General procedure for the synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetraarylimidazole 6a–6h Again a mixture of benzil 1 (10mmol), ammonium acetate 2 (10mmol), aromatic aldehyde 3 (10mmol), aniline 4 (10mmol) and iodine (5mol%) in 2ml of ethanol was stirred at 75°C for the appropriate time mentioned in Table 4. The completion of reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of reaction, same work-up procedure was followed as followed in the synthesis of 2,4,5-triarylimidazole 4a–4h) (Schemes 2 and 3 ). 1.3 Spectral and analytical data Compound 4a, mp: 272–273°C; IR (cm−1, Nujol): 3432 (NH), 1660 (CC), 1550 (CN); 1H NMR (CDCl3/DMSO-d 6): δ =7.52–7.91 (m, 15H), 12.62 (br, s, NH) ppm; 13C NMR (CDCl3/DMSO-d 6): δ =122.5, 127.0, 128.7, 129.2, 136.4ppm; Anal.
