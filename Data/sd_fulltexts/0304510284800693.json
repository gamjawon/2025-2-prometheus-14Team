As a part of our work on hydrogen transfer reactions from isopropanol to ketones catalyzed by transition metal complexes [1] we have investigated the reaction R^ H,C OH % H,C ^+ x ^ ^+ >= ^ H,C H HO-\" H3C where R = H, or t-butyl group, using as catalyst precursor iridium complexes of the type [Ir(COD)L2]'1' (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, L^ = t-phosphine ligands). Results and experimental conditions are summarized in Table 1. [L^CODXPPl^i]\"'\" turned out to be the most active catalyst ever reported for this kind of reaction, with a turn-over number of 175 000 expressed in moles of substrate X (moles of catalyst)\"1 X min\"1, calculated over the first 15 s of reaction (run 2, Table 1). Such extremely high activity places this complex on the same level as horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (Table 2), for which a turnover number of 5000 was found at 27 C in the case of cyclohexanone as sub- strate [2], and makes it probably one of the most active synthetic homoge- neous catalysts ever reported for any kind of reaction. Catalytic activity depends on the basicity of the coordinated phos- phine, decreasing according to the sequence: PPh3> P(p-tolyl)3> P(p-anisyl)3 > PMePh2> Pti2P(CH2)2PPh2 [3]. This trend is roughly parallel to the one found for hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates, where a non-oxidative addition of hydrogen was proposed [4]. Potassium hydroxide must be present in solution and it plays a funda- mental role in the reaction, probably facilitating the formation of alkoxo complexes which could be reactive intermediates in the hydrogen transfer 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 310 TABLE 1 Reduction of ketones in isopropanol at 83 C using [Ir(COD)L2I'\" as the catalyst pre- cursor' Run 10s X [catalyst] (mol l 1) [substrate ] Conversion (%) (time) L Turnover number1' [catalyst] l 2 30000 75 (10 s) PPhs 130000 99 (4 min) 7400 2 1.2 100000 44 (15 s) PPha 175000 80 (4 min) 20000 85 (120 min) 700 3 2 30000 33 (10 s) PPhs 60000 52 (4 min) 3900 4e 1.2 50000 34 (15 s) PPhs 68000 77 (8 min) 4800 5e 1.2 50000 19 (15 s) P(p-tolyl)3 38000 62 (8 min) 3900 6e 1.2 50000 11 (15 s) P(p-anisyl)a 22000 45 (8 min) 2800 7 1.2 50000 3.5 (30 min) Ph2P(CHi)2PPh2 60 8 1.2 50000 13.5 (30 min) PMePhi 225 44 (280 min) 80 reaction conditions: Substrate 4-t-butylcyclohexanone, except in run 3 where cyclo- hexanone was used. Precursor and substrate were treated in 50 ml of degassed i-PrOH with HI for 5 min. The temperature was increased to 83 C and KOH added through a serum cap with a microsyringe. Reaction time started after the addition of KOH. [KOH] = 1 X 10~3 M. In all cases the experiments were carried out strictly under argon.

A slow down in the reaction rate is generally observed, particularly at very high substrate/catalyst ratio, and this effect can probably be attrib- uted to impurities present in the solution or to the formation of less active species under these particular experimental conditions. Table 2 reports the catalytic activities of various iridium complexes for the reduction of the carbonyl group via hydrogen transfer. A comparison between the turnover numbers of runs 1 and 3 shows that it is possible to increase the activity of a catalyst by 104 or more times by changing the ligands and the reaction conditions. Moreover, the comparable results re- ported for [Ir(COD)(PPh3)2]'1' and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (runs 3 and 4, Table 2) indicate that in principle it is possible to obtain synthetic catalysts as active as enzymes. 311 TABLE 2 Reduction of carbonyl group via hydrogen transfer reaction using various catalysts at 83 C Catalyst Substrate Turnover Conversion Ref. number (%) (cycles min\"1) l IrCl3(DMSO)3 cyclohexanone 0.1 97 6 2 [lt(COD)(3,4,7 ss-Me^hen)}* 4-t-butylcyclo-hexanone 1000 98.8 7 3 [Ir(COD)(PPh3)ir 4-t-butylcyclo-hexanone 7400 99 this work cyclohexanone 3900 52 this work 4-t-butylcyclo-hexanone 1750001' 44 this work cyclohexanone 60000e 33 this work 4 alcohol dehydrogenase-1,1,1,1 4-t-butylcyclo-hexanone 125 (27 C)<1 2 cyclohexanone 5000 (27 \"C)'1 ~~ 2 Average values calculated over the reaction time.
