Kevwords: Hydrogenation by dihydrogen; Transfer hydrogenation; Nitrogen ligands; Water soluble phosphine ligands 1. Introduction Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes in organic solvents by organometallic complexes was intensively studied. These studies comprise complexes between various transition metals and ligands with phosphor and nitrogen as donor atoms [1-3]. Even more attention has been paid to homogeneous hydrogenation of ketones, however, since their reduction usually leads to compounds with a new stereogenic (chiral) centre. Stereoselectivity (enantioselectivity) in reduction of ketones is therefore one of the main issues in the application of chiral Corresponding author. Permanent address: \"Podravka^, R. Co.

The difference between these two substrates resides not only in the fact that hydrogenation of aldehydes does not create new chiral centre (unless the isotope I H is used), but also in the tendency of aldehydes to undergo catalytic decarbonylation, whereas ketones are stable in the presence of the same homogeneous catalysts. Hydrogenation of aldoses, or sugars generally, is traditionally performed under elevated hydrogen pressure in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts [6-8]. Because of their complete insolubility in organic solvents, where most homogeneous catalysts are operative, homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of aldoses in aqueous solution is only recently reported [9]. This review covers therefore in the first part the application of homogeneous catalysts in hydro- 240 S. Kolari V, gunji/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 239-249 genation of aldehydes in aqueous solvents, and in the final part it reports on the use of analogous water-soluble catalytic species. 2. Hydrogenation of aldehydes by molecular hydrogen in organic solvents Complexes of transition metals with triphenylphosphine, such as RuC12(PPh3)3, RhCI(PPh3)3, and IrH3(PPh3)3, have been proven as effective catalysts in hydrogenation of multiple C-C bond and carbonyl group [2]. Tsuji and Suzuki have performed hydrogenation of aldehydes with RuC12(PPh3)3 (1) in benzene at 50-80 and hydrogen pressure 10-20 bar [10]. Under these conditions both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are reduced quantitatively to primary alcohols. These authors have also demonstrated that completely selective hydrogenation of benzaldehyde in the presence of benzophenone or nitrobenzene can be achieved under specific conditions, although it was known that complex 1 is an effective catalyst for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline [11-13]. [RuH2(PPh3)41 (2) [RuH2(CO)(PPh3)31 (3) [RuC12(PPh 3 )31 (4) [RhH(PPh3)4] (5) [RhCI(CO)(PPh3)2] (6) [CoH[P(OPh)3] 31 (7) [FeC12(PPh 3 )21 (8) [N'C12(PPh 3)21 (9) [COC12(PPh3)2] (10) [PdC12(PPh 3)21 (11) [PtC12(PPh3)2] (12) i - [RhCI(PPh3)31 (13) D icarbonyl congener of 1, RuC12(CO)2(PPh3)2, is an effective catalyst for hydrogenation of linear and branched aliphatic aldehydes at relatively low hydrogen pressure (15 bar) and elevated temperatures, 160-200. Such harsh conditions led to the formation of the side products, in particular with linear aliphatic aldehydes [ 14]. RhCI(PPh3)3 is a highly efficient catalyst for hydrogenation of alkenes, conjugated and nonconjugated dienes, and alkynes [15], but during hydrogenation of aldehydes it also acts as decarbonylating agent. Carbonylic complex that is formed, RhCI(CO)(PPh3)2, is completely catalytically inactive [15]. Primary aldehydes are decarbonylated by RhCI(PPh3)3 already at ambient temperature; after 24 h in dichloromethane 90% of n-heptanal is decarbonylated [16]. Decarbonylation of secondary aldehydes can be achieved at reflux of toluene, sterically more impeded aldehydes proved unreactive [16]. Decarbonylation of aldehydes by Rh complexes have been studied by Ohno and Tsuji [17], and Baird et al. [16], who proposed the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1. s ~ 3 RCHO~ r 3 RhCI(P)3 \"~;;-4 S ~-_ Rho ----[ RCHOP /Rh C ~` PPh3 C( '* PPh3 H in RCHOI O n R c\\ H S 'k i Ag PP113 Rh C( R PPh3 Iv 0 11 H PPh3 I _\\ !h C R ' yer C, s PPh3 RCHO' 0 n ,,c \\ R H RCHO a f 3 CI ~ PP63 O*C~H K PPh3 RhCICOI2 + paraffin + olefine S=solvent; L=ligand Scheme 1. S. Kolari V. Sunji/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 711 (1996) 239-249 Osborn et al. have demonstrated solvation of I to diphosphine II [15]. This species posses strong affinity for CO and forms stable complex RhCI(CO)(PPh3)3. Baird et al. pointed out the coordination of aldehyde in III as an alternative or subsequent step to the formation of II [ 16]. Both II and III are 16-electron species, however, and can oxidatively add a second mol of aldehyde forming complexes IV or V. The last part of the cycle initiates the transfer of hydrogen to metal, and results from decarbonylation of aldehyde and formation of alkane. The overall rate of decarbonylation represents a process of autoinhibition of the catalyst, and is determined by the oxidative addition step. Once formed, acyl complex undergoes fast decarbonylation by migration of the alkyl group. Carbonylation can be monitored by the colour change of the solution from deep-red to yellow [ 16]. C om plexes of the type [Rh(NBD)(PR3)Z]+C104- (NBDnorbornadiene, R-alkyl group) also catalyst hydrogenation of aldehydes [18]. Their catalytic activity is strongly dependent on the type of trialkyl phosphine. The complex with PEt3 ligand proved notably more active than with PMe3, PPh3-complex was active only with phenylacetaldehyde whereas Ph 2 P-CH ZCH 2-PPh 2 (diphos) complex was catalytically completely inactive in hydrogenation. The overall rates are generally rather low at low hydrogen pressures; [Rh(NBD)(PEt3)Z]+C104 has converted ca. 400 of n-butanal to n-butanol after 24 h at 30 and 1 bar hydrogen pressure. Propane and propene have been identified in the reaction mixture, revealing contemporaneous decarbonylation. Deactivation of the catalyst by the substrate diminishes in the order: n-butyraldehyde >_ phenylacetaldehyde >_ benzaldehyde. Hydrogenation of aldehydes by cationic Rh complexes is proposed to follow the pathway depicted in Scheme 2 [18]. Stereoelectronic bases of the outlined mechanism, in particular for the step IX - X, resides in high polarization of the sterically relatively 241 Rh(NBD)12 + 3H2 (NBD) f H + ' I /L fRh12(XON]+ / H-Rh S] RCHO JJH VI RCHO~ H L lRhLZS,]+~ IRhL2(RCHO)Syl~---r H-Rb O-C/H H2 L/ I - ~R RC HO XI S RCH20H '/r L I HO- - _H-Rh - O- CH2R O H/ VIII S=solvent; L=ligand; NBD=norbcMtane Scheme 2.

The complex X cannot be regenerated to catalytically active species VI at low hydrogen pressure; at higher pressures process IX -> VI becomes reversible and suppresses self-deactivation of the catalyst. Stereoelectronic arguments are offered only for selective activity of PPh3-complex with phenylacetaldehyde; coordination of phenyl group within cationic Rh complex leads to formation of particularly reactive XII in Scheme 2 [ 18]. The only reported Ir complex active in hydrogenation of aldehydes, IrH3(PPh3)3 involves formation of [Ir(HZ)(CH3C00)(PPh3)3] as the actual catalytic species in acetic acid [ 19]. Butyraldehyde is quantitatively hydrogenated at 50 and 1 bar hydrogen pressure. Hydrogenation completely ceased in toluene or in neat butyraldehyde, addition of acetic acid initiates the reaction, however. All these data converge to [Ir(HZ)(CH3C00)(PPh3)3] as the actual catalytic complex whose formation in the presence of acetic acid is documented [20]. According to Coffey [19] hydrogenation of aldehydes catalyzed by this Ir complex can be accommodated by the pseudo first-order kinetics, calculated on the concentrations of aldehyde and catalyst. 242 S. Kolari V. Sunji/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 239-249 3. Hydrogenation of aldehydes by transfer hydrogenation in organic solvents Many complexes of Rh, Ir and Ru promote hydrogen transfer from an hydrogen donor to aldehydes [2]. As the usual sources of hydrogen are used primary and secondary alcohols, formic acid and its salts. Imai et al. [21 ] have performed first systematic study of catalytic activity of phosphine complexes of various metals (2-13) in transfer hydrogenation of n-hexanal with benzylalkohol as hydrogen donor. With complex 2 90% conversion, and with 3 78% conversion after 150 min at 120 was achieved. Complex 4 was far less catalytically active, while complexes 5-12 were completely inactive under cited conditions. For 13 was confirmed that deactivation is result of decarbonylation of aldehyde [17,18,22,23]. With complex 2 other sources of hydrogen, as 2-propanol, cyclohexanol or 2,5-dihydrofurane, proved also convenient; on the bases of kinetic measurements Imai et al. proposed the mechanism outlined in Scheme 3 [21]. Starting from Ru(PPh3)3, aldehyde and alcohol, addition complex XIII is formed. Oxidative addition of the OH group to Rh atom. accompanied by the hydride transfer, affords hydride-alkoxyde-complex XIV, which affects hydride transfer to the carbonyl group forming dialkoxyde complex XV. Finally, this complex rearranges to XVI, which reduces aldehyde and oxidizes alcohol. Various formiates are well known sources of hydrogen in homogeneous catalytic transfer hy- Table 1 Catalytic reductions with formates Compound reduced Catalytic system Product o tr3)3RJ .'

The examples are given in the Table 1. Low solubility of formiates in most organic solvents limits their application to highly polar ones like DMSO or DMF [29], or to the phase transfer catalytic systems [30], where formiate anion is extracted from the aqueous to organic phase by lipophilic quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. Bar and Sasson [31] have studied hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones by the phase-transfer catalysis, using sodium formiate and RuC12(PPh3)3 in the presence of Aliquat 336. Hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes was performed under argon in the two-phase system xylene-water at 90; after 30 min 50-70% conversion was achieved.

Pillai et al. [34] demonstrated that RuC12(PPh3)3 catalyses de hydrogenation of some alcohols from natural sources, like menthol, cholesterol and cytronelol, but carbonylation of the catalyst by the formed aldehydes was also observed. Crowdhury and Bkvall [35] performed de tailed studies of the transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone by primary and secondary alco hols in the presence of RuCI(PPh3)3 and RuH4(PPh3)3. Whereas 2-propanol proved very effective with both catalytic species, reaction in ethanol was notably sluggished, an in methanol it failed completely. After 1 h, 89% conversion to cyclohexanol was observed with 2-propanol as hydrogen source in the presence of NaOH, whereas with ethanol after 4 h only 28% con version was reached. The presence of hydroxide ions seems obligatory for the formation of alkoxyde ions bound to Ru in the complex, and %1N ND H Ali--- (f_ N c ~N ~~,OH- RIz~b C~ H ,I `OH R CH )r CH3-'CHOH /'~N N /4h,_ 0.C R chel=bisnien ligand HZO %1N~ N- ~O'~ CH1\\~ N H ~CH3 1V O NL1Rh-H _.~ \\'~ R R Scheme 4. 243 slower reaction with primary alcohols was ascribed to deactivation of the complex by CO. The mechanism of this reaction was assumed to be similar to that described by Morton and Cole-Hamilton [36], and also proposed by Mestroni et al. for transfer hydrogenation of ketones by some Rh complexes with bisnitrogen ligands [37], Scheme 4. Much lower activity in transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes as compared to ketones was demonstrated for IrHC12(MeZS04)3 complex in the presence of 2-propanol [38]. Hydrogenation of cyclohexanon after 2 h at 90 reached 97%, whereas only 5% of butyraldehyde was reduced under the same conditions. 4.

Kolari V. SunjiJournal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 239-249 reduction of substrates soluble in organic solvents combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis: simple and complete separation of the products from the catalyst, high reactivity and high selectivity. Such catalytic reactions are performed in two-phase systems, and industrial applications in the field of hydrogenation [39,40] and hydroformylation [41,42] have already indicated the wide scope of this type of catalysis. However, with water-soluble organic substrates lake sugars, homogeneous catalysis with water-soluble complexes is obligatory, though their separation from the catalyst usually is not trivial and requires specific chromatographic techniques. In order to effectively perform this reaction, ligands which form water-soluble transition metal complexes are required. To this aim triaryl phosphines are modified to hydrophilic ligands by introduction of polar, ionized groups. Water soluble phosphine complexes are usually prepared from hydroxylated, carboxylated, amminated, and sulphonated phosphines [43-45]. Sodium salt of tri(meta-sulphonylphenyl)phosphine, P(C6H4S03Na)3, TPPTS, represents one of the best water-soluble ligands (1200 g/1). A series of its Ru complexes 14-20 has been examined in hydrogenation of propanal in water at 100 and 50 bar hydrogen pressure [46,47]. 1 /2 [RuC12 L2] 2 (RuHCI L3 ] [RuH(OAc) L3] [RuH2 L4] [RuHI L3 ] [RuCL2(CO)2 LZ] [Ru(OAc)(CO)2 L] 2 [ L = tri(meta-sulphonylphenyl)phosphine)] (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) Fast and quantitative reduction to propanol was achieved with all complexes, though IR spectra of the reaction solution indicated formation of carbonylated Ru species.

It was also demonstrated that catalytic activity of the complexes 14-17 is promoted by the inorganic salts [47]. Hydrogenation of propanal in the presence of NaI was faster at 30 than at 100 in the absence of this salt. Activity of the catalyst is dependent on both, anion and cation of the added salt. Hydrogenation rate was enhanced by the anions in the order HC1:SbF6 < N03 <_ Cl < Br c J, and by the cations of the order of Li +< K+<_ Na+> Mg2+< Ca2+. The same authors proposed catalytic cycles in aqueous solution initiated by RuH2(TPPTS)3, as outlined in the Scheme 5, corresponding to that proposed for hydrogenation of aldehydes in organic solvents [48]. Iodide ion enters into coordination sphere of the complexes 1-4, as confirmed by I H-, 13C-, and 31 P-NMR spectra [46].

Subsequent interaction with the electrophilic centre, as e.g. sodium cation, changes coordination from 712 to q1, precluding hydrogen transfer to the carbon atom, and promoting formation of the complex D. In the next step complex D hydrolyses into E which undergoes reductive elimination to n-propanol and complex F. This latter complex regenerates starting complex A by oxidative addition of hydrogen. One mole of HI is formed in the last step, which is neutralized by the base formed in the hydrolysis of C, and regeneration of the salt is completed. Joet al.

At neutral pH 22 was inactive, by formation of its stable complex with oxoacid, as explained by the authors. 5. Homogeneous hydrogenation of aldoses Kruse et al [50] studied hydrogenation of D-glucose by RuClz(PPh3)3 in various solvents at 75 and 3 bar hydrogen pressure. Kinetic measurements in dimethylacetamide (DMA) revealed no enhancement of the rate at hydrogen pressures over 3 bar. The rate was of the first order in concentration of aldose and the catalyst, and was dependent on the solvent used, Table 3. D-Fructose was hydrogenated in DMA at approximate the same rate as D-glucose, affording a 58:42 mixture of D-mannitol/D-sorbitol. Based on the kinetic data the authors proposed the mechanism outlined in Scheme 7. Coordination of aldoses to the solvated complex XVI results in aldehyde-Ru complex XVII wherein hydrogen transfer from Ru atom to carbonyl carbon leads to alkoxy-Ru complex XVIII. Second, hydrogen transfer takes place in the next step, and Ru-O bond cleaves affording alkoxyde XIX.

Rajagopal et al. [51,52] described the first transfer hydrogenation of aldose, D-glucose catalyzed by RuC12(PPh3)3 in the presence of various alcohols as hydrogen donors in the mixtures of organic solvents and water, Table 4. In the absence of an effective hydrogen donor D-glucose disproportionates into D-sorbitol and 1,5-gluconolactone [53]. This process is significantly slower when secondary alcohol is used as the solvent and hydrogen donor.

All these species have been isolated from the reaction solution and spectroscopically identified; their formation from the open form of D-glucose was postulated [54,55]. D-Fructose was also hydrogenated in the presence of RuC12(PPh3)3, and propanol-2 or butanol-2 as hydrogen donors [56]. At 100 conversion was complete, and ca. 1:1 mixture of D-mannitol/D-sorbitol was obtained. In our recent study [9], we have compared relative rates of hydrogenation of epimeric al- S. Kolari V.

Both methods proved effective, transfer hydrogenation was pH and temperature dependent, and D-mannose proved more reactive isomer. Fig. 1 shows much faster hydrogenation of D-mannose at hydrogen pressure of 50 bar, and also promoting effect of sodium iodide, as already discussed in the Section 4. Fig. 2 reveals that transfer hydrogenation with formiate strongly depends on the counterion. Azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine (5:2) was much more effective than sodium or ammonium formiate. The former reagent was successfully used by Brunner and co-workers in transfer hydrogenation of a,nsaturated carboxylic acids [57,58]. 6.

Though this side reaction usually leads to self-deactivation of the catalyst, conditions are presently known where hydrogenation could be safely performed with high regioselectivity and in good yields. Future development is expected in the field of homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation in aqueous solution, where significantly lower hydrogen pressures, or the use of inorganic salts as hydrogen donors put no special demand on the equipment, and thus outweighs the eventual need for chromatographic separation of the complex homogeneous catalyst.
