Graphical abstract In this study the amorphous Co–P alloy was electrodeposited on Cu sheet to produce a film form catalyst for hydrogen generation reactions. The effect of NaH2PO2 concentration on the microstructures of Co–P alloys and their catalytic activities for hydrolysis of NaBH4 were investigated. Experimental results showed that the deposited Co–P alloys exhibited amorphous structure and when 1.0M NaH2PO2 was used, the highest hydrogen generation rate of 5965mL (ming-catalyst)−1 was achieved. This rate was 1.4 folds higher than the reported electroless-deposited Co–P catalysts. Furthermore, the activation energy for hydrolysis of NaBH4 was as low as 23.9kJmol−1. The durability of the Co–P catalyst was also tested and showed stable activity in 5 cycles. Keywords Sodium borohydride Hydrogen generation Fuel cells Cobalt phosphorus 1 Introduction Recently, the researches of fuel cells became increasingly important due to the depletion of fossil fuel [1]. Since the methods of hydrogen storage were still inefficient, the application of hydrogen fuel cell was still immature and quite limited [2]. In this regard, developing efficient in situ hydrogen supply technique was one of the key issues in improving fuel cell feasibility. Using metal hydrides with high hydrogen storage capacity, such as NaBH4, LiBH4, NaH and NaAlH4 were proposed to be a promising way. Among these compounds, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) received an extensive attention owing to its ability to contain as high as 10.8wt% of hydrogen [3]. Besides, the aqueous alkaline sodium borohydride solution had several advantages in portable applications, such as the environmentally benign of hydrolysis product (NaBO2), the low reaction initiating temperature and controllable rate of hydrogen generation when used with proper catalysts. But the high cost in sodium borohydride production process was proposed in the practical use [1,4]. Many researchers have focused on the reproduction of NaBO2 back to sodium borohydride to solve this problem [5,6]. Previously, various catalysts had been tested in NaBH4 hydrogen fuel cell, including noble metal materials, such as Pt/LiCoO2 [7], Pt–Ru [8] and Özkar et al. has a good insight into the catalytic of Ru [9–12]. In order to decrease the cost, substitutions of noble metal catalyst were required. In recent years, the amorphous alloy catalyst of transition metal borides was extensively studied owing to its high catalytic activity. Amorphous alloy is a class of material with long-range disordered but short-range ordered structure and presented attractive performance in catalysis. In recent reports, using of amorphous alloy Ni–B [13], Cu–Zr [14] and Ni–P–B in hydrogenation [15] had been reported and showed promising catalytic activities. Fernandes et al. synthesized metal-doped Co–B alloy catalysts by mixing cobalt salt solution and other metal salts. The mixture was reduced to elemental state by adding sodium borohydride [16,17]. They demonstrated that Co–B based alloy catalysts Co–Ni–B [18] and Co–P–B [19] exhibited high catalytic activity in NaBH4 hydrolysis. Kalu et al. deposited Co–Ni–P ternary alloy on Pd-activated TiO2 [20] and Komova et al. generated Co–B in situ [21] both obtained high activity in NaBH4 hydrolysis. According to Patel, B and P showed two effects: promoting the formation of amorphous; B could increase electron density of Co and P could create more Co active sites on the surface [22]. However, powder form catalysts had several disadvantages such as difficult to separated, easily aggregated and difficult to handle in continuous flow systems. Using of the catalysts in thin film form avoided such problems [23,24]. The catalysts could easily coat on the inner wall of the reactor. Meanwhile, the hydrogen generation rate on the thin film could be controlled by changing the contact area. The catalyst was synthesized via electroplating or electroless deposition methods. Dai et al. supported Fe–Co–B catalyst on Ni foam by electroless plating [25]. Compared with electroless deposition method, electroplating methods had several advantages such as wider range of compositions, easier to control and lower processing temperature. The effects of NaH2PO2 on electroless Co–P catalyst had been tested [26] and it was found that the hydrolysis rate of NaBH4 was influenced by the concentration of NaH2PO2. However, the effect in electroplating method had not been investigated. In this work, the effect of the concentrations of NaH2PO2 was systematically studied by analyzing the microstructures, morphology and the hydrogen generation properties of as-prepared Co–P catalysts in alkaline NaBH4 solution. It was observed that the activity of Co–P catalyst was significantly influenced by the concentrations of NaH2PO2 and the highest hydrogen generation rate of 5965mL (ming-catalyst)−1 at 30°C was achieved, which was higher than the electroless deposition of Co–P catalyst. Compare with our previous paper [27], the hydrogen generation rate was increased through doping and optimizing NaH2PO2 concentrations. It also indicated that the hydrogen generation rate could be further increased by controlling the (Co+doping metal)/P. 2 Experimental method 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Co–P catalysts were synthesized by the electroplating method. A Cu sheet with an exposed surface area of 2cm×3cm was used as the substrate. A pure graphite rod was used as an anode. Before plating, the Cu sheet was successively polished by sanding, degreased with absolute alcohol, and activated for 1.0min in 10wt% H2SO4 solution. The electrodeposition of the catalysts was conducted in a sulfate based solution containing 0.10M CoSO4·7H2O, 0.80–1.1M NaH2PO2·H2O trisodium citrate (TSC) and (NH4)2SO4 was used as complexing agent and the concentration was 0.30M and 0.15M, respectively. The effects of the concentrations of NaH2PO2 on deposition rate in electroplating Co–P bath was presented in Fig. 1 . In Co–P bath, when the concentration of NaH2PO2 was 1.0M, the deposition rate decreased to the lowest (0.238mgmin−1 cm−2). 2.2 Characterization The surface morphology and the composition of the Co–P catalysts were analyzed by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The microstructure of the electrodeposited catalysts was observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface electronic states of the Co and P in the catalytic surface (∼2nm) of the Co–P catalyst and the compositions of electrodeposited Co–P catalyst were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2.3 Measurement of hydrogen generation rate The hydrogen generation in experiments was analyzed by measuring the displacement weight of water from the cylinder during the reaction proceeded which similar to Ref [28]. The hydrogen generation rate was indicated by using the unit of [mL (ming-catalyst)−1]. Typically, 20mL 10wt% NaBH4 solution with 10wt% NaOH was firstly placed in a sealed flask with thermal couple and the temperature was kept constant. In order to eliminate the substrate influence, the Co–P catalysts (2cm×3cm) was dropped into the NaBH4 solution to initiate hydrogen generation in all experiments and no stirring was undertaken during the reaction. The Co–P catalyst hydrogen generation reaction was carried out at 30, 35, 45 and 50°C, and the activation energy was calculated. Finally, cycle test of the catalyst was conducted for 5 cycles in 20mL 10wt% NaBH4 and 10wt% NaOH solution at 30°C for 30min. The Co–P catalyst electrodeposited in the Co–P bath in NaH2PO2 concentration is 1.0M was employed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effects of NaH2PO2 in Co–P bath Fig. 2(a) showed X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Cu sheet-supported Co–P catalysts under various NaH2PO2 concentrations. The deposition weight of electrodeposited Co–P was maintained at 0.90mgcm−2. For all the Co–P catalysts, only the substrate peak Cu (111) and Cu (200) were observed. No Co phase was detected. The broad peak was about 45°, which represented the amorphous structure of deposited Co–P films. The surface morphologies of the electrodeposited Co–P catalysts were intimately depended on NaH2PO2 concentration, as shown in Fig. 2(b–e). It was obvious that the Co–P films could be divided into two parts: the outer spherical Co–P particles and the inner Co–P layer. The micro-cracks on the inner flat of Co–P films indicated the existence of residual stress. The diameter of the spherical Co–P particles was about 3.0μm. As the NaH2PO2 concentration increased, the size of spherical Co–P particles decreased while the outer spherical catalyst particles increased. When the NaH2PO2 concentration was 1.0M, the largest number of spherical Co–P particles was observed. When the NaH2PO2 concentration further increased to 1.1M, the outer spherical catalyst particles were broken up. This was mainly due to the severe hydrogen production during the electroplating. The EDX analysis showed that the chemical composition of the deposited Co–P alloy films was sensitive to the NaH2PO2 concentration. The content of P in the deposited Co–P alloy increased with rising NaH2PO2 concentration (Table 1 ). The incorporation deposition of phosphorus, can be described by the following equation: (1) H2PO2 − +e→P+2OH− So when the concentration of NaH2PO2 increased, more H2PO2 − got electron at cathode and resulted in more P in electroplating films. Fig. 2(f) showed the hydrogen generation kinetics of the Co–P catalysts at different NaH2PO2 concentrations. The specific hydrogen generation rate (mLmg−1) was used to describe the hydrogen production. At 0.60M NaH2PO2, hydrogen generation rate was only 1303mL (ming-Co)−1, which mainly due to the low content of P and the small amount of outer spherical catalyst particles. When the concentration of NaH2PO2 was increased from 0.80 to 0.90M, the hydrogen generation rate increased from 1665 to 2412mL (ming-Co)−1. When the concentration of NaH2PO2 was further increased to 1.0M, the highest hydrogen generation rate 8112mL (ming-Co)−1 was obtained. The value was higher than the Co–P catalysts electroless deposited on Cu sheet [22]. When the concentration of NaH2PO2 was up to 1.1M, the hydrogen generation rate decreased to 5111mL (ming-Co)−1. When the concentration of NaH2PO2 was 1.0M, the deposition rate was the lowest, which facilitated the nucleation of the outer spherical Co–P particles and restrained the inner Co–P layer deposition. In conclusion, to attain the best catalytic activity, more spherical Co–P particles at low deposition and appropriate P content in the deposited Co–P catalyst was required. 3.2 XPS To understand the effect of phosphorous in catalyst, it is necessary to study the surface electronic interaction with various phosphorous. Thus, Fig. 3 showed the XPS spectra of Co 2p3/2 and P 2p in the Co–P catalyst. On the surface of Co–P catalyst, cobalt was composed of both elemental Co (Co0) 778.4eV and oxidized Co (Co2+) 781.9eV at the Co 2p3/2 bonding orbital level. If one compares the intensity of the peaks of elemental Co (Co0) 778.4eV there is the highest intensity when the concentration of NaH2PO2 was 1.0M. The oxidized Co peak due to oxidized Co was mainly related to the Co(OH)2 which formed during the catalyst preparation reaction and the oxidation by ambient atmosphere [29]. Fortunately, but this oxidized Co can be easily reduced by NaBH4 in the course of the hydrogen generation. At the P 2p bonding orbital level, two kinds of phosphorous species appeared on the surface of Co–P catalyst. The peaks around 133.0eV was assigned to oxidized phosphorus and the peak around 129.1eV was assigned to phosphorus interacting with cobalt. A large number of oxidation phosphorus peaks were observed, indicating P provided a large number of electrons. So the synergistic effect of P and Co created high number of Co active sites on the surface of catalyst. 3.3 Hydrogen generation kinetics of the Co–P catalyst Fig. 4 showed the kinetics of hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of alkaline sodium borohydride solution in the presence of Co–P catalysts at different solution temperatures. The Co–P catalyst was electrodeposited on Cu in Co–P bath with 1.0M NaH2PO2. The apparent activation energy (E a) was determined by the following Arrhenius equation: (2) ln k = ln k 0 − ( E a / R T ) where k is the reaction rate (molmin−1 g−1), k 0 is the reaction constant (molmin−1 g−1), R is the gas constant and T is the solution temperature. It was observed that when the solution temperature was 35°C, the hydrogen generation rate of Co–P was 7115mL (ming-catalyst)−1. And when the solution temperature increased to 45°C, the hydrogen generation rate for Co–P was 9600mL (ming-catalyst)−1.When the solution temperature increased to 50°C, the hydrogen generation rate for Co–P was 12,076mL (ming-catalyst)−1. The activation energy (E a) of the hydrolysis reaction by using Co–P catalyst was determined to be 23.9kJmol−1. The value was lower than the previously reported 33.0kJmol−1 in Co–B/Ni catalysts [30], 35.245kJmol−1 in Co–Co2B nanocomposites, 55.81kJmol−1 in Ni–Ni3B nanocomposites [31] and 49.6kJmol−1 in Co–Cu–B catalyst [32]. 3.4 Cycle behavior of Co–P catalyst The cycle test of the Co–P catalyst was performed in 20mL 10wt% NaBH4 and 10wt% NaOH solution at 30°C. As showed in Fig. 5(a), the H2 generation rate decreased by 32% after the first cycle, mainly due to the separation of the outer spherical Co–P particles and the decreased surface area. From the third cycle to the fifth cycle, the H2 generation rate remained at 60% of the initial H2 generation rate. The surface morphologies of Co–P catalyst after 5 cycles were presented in Fig. 5(b). It can be seen some spherical particles separated from the surface of the catalyst and some were broken up. The XPS spectra of Co2p3/2 and P2p in the Co–P catalyst before and after 5 cycles testing are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). After 5 cycles, of the peak signifying metallic Co (Co0) and the peak representing metallic Co (Co2+) almost disappears but the peak representing metallic Co (Co3+) increases in amplitude. Meanwhile, the peaks representing elemental P(P0) and oxidized P (P5+) both decreases dramatically after 5 cycles. The relevant investigation had been studied by Kwon et al., which reported that after 5 cycles of the test, H2 generation rate decreased due to the decreased number of P atoms which produced metallic Co active sites [33]. And they reported that after 10 cycles, the spherical particles separated from the surface of the catalyst and some were broken up [34]. 4 Conclusions In this article, we prepared the Co–P catalysts electrodeposited from Co–P bath under several of NaH2PO2 concentrations, and investigated the hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution by these catalysts. The experimental results showed that the hydrogen generation properties of the electrodeposited Co–P catalysts in alkaline NaBH4 solution largely depended on NaH2PO2 concentrations. To obtain high hydrogen generation rate [mL (ming-catalyst)−1], the proper NaH2PO2 concentration of 1.0M was used for Co–P catalysts. Under the proper deposition weight of 0.9mgcm−2, the highest hydrogen generation rate of 5965mL (ming-catalyst)−1 was achieved. In summary, the morphology of the catalysts, deposition weight (mgcm−2) and their composition influenced the hydrogen generation rate. The as-prepared catalysts showed promising recycling ability and lower activation energy compared with other reported Co-based catalysts. Hence, this high activity, low-cost and reusability Co-based catalyst was economically viable and excellent for hydrogen production from NaBH4 alkaline hydrolysis process. References [1] U.B.
