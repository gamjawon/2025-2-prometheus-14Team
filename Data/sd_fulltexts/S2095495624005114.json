Graphical abstract The Li-S reaction-oriented MXene catalytic electrode is designed by using the ice template assisted freeze drying technology. The lithium-sulfur reaction can contribute to the chemical electrical energy conversion capacity due to the multi-level ion/electron transfer process. However, the appearance of soluble intermediate products prevents efficient electron transfer, making it impossible to achieve stable cycling and capacity contribution. Restricted catalysis provides a solution for inhibiting the shuttle of soluble lithium polysulfides. Herein, MXene aerogel with optimized channel utilization is designed as S host according to the polysulfide control strategy of localization, adsorption, and catalysis. With the help of the results of oriented channels, the polysulfide conversion process is optimized, providing a comprehensive scheme for inhibiting the shuttle effect. Lithium sulfur catalytic batteries have achieved high capacity and stable cycling. This system provides a comprehensive solution for lithium sulfur reaction catalysis and a new perspective for the functional application of MXene based lithium sulfur batteries. Keywords MXene Aerogel Lithium-sulfur battery Catalyst 1 Introduction With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its huge demand for electricity has raised concerns about its environmental impact. To address this challenge, the development of renewable energy and the construction of smart grids and energy storage systems have become crucial [1,2]. Electrochemical energy storage technology plays a crucial role in building smart grids and promoting energy industry innovation, especially in improving the utilization rate of renewable energy and the stability of the power grid, which has strategic significance [3–6]. At present, lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) are in a leading position in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their superior energy density. However, the positive electrode oxidation-reduction reaction generates soluble polysulfides, which shuttle to the negative electrode under concentration gradient and electric field action and undergo chemical reaction with the lithium metal negative electrode to deposit insulating sulfides, leading to corrosion of the lithium metal negative electrode and continuous consumption of electrolyte [7], causing the capacity degradation, shortened cycle life, and reduced efficiency of LSBs [8,9]. In order to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides in LSBs and accelerate the S reaction kinetics, the idea of constructing a polysulfide conversion space based on low-density materials and achieving “physical confinement” has been systematically explored, such as constructing mesoporous [10] and graded porous carbon [11], hollow carbon spheres [12], carbon nanotubes [13], graphene [14], carbon fibers [15], and other materials to form materials with high specific surface area and specific pore structures, and using enclosed spaces to prevent the migration of polysulfides [16,17]. However, non-polar carbon materials have poor chemical affinity with polar polysulfides, making it difficult to effectively adsorb polysulfide ions and provide active sites, resulting in a lower conversion rate of polysulfides. In order to increase the interaction between polysulfides and host materials, polar materials such as metal oxides [18], carbides [19], sulfides [20,21], and nanoparticles [22] are used to construct positive electrodes. By adding “chemical adsorption” sites, polysulfide ions are effectively adsorbed, reducing their shuttle through during battery charging and discharging processes [23,24]. The electrochemical conversion of polysulfides involves complex reaction processes, including multi-step electron transfer and the formation and decomposition of sulfides [25–27]. The kinetics of the reaction steps is slow, especially in the conversion process from high-order polysulfides to low-order sulfides [28]. On the basis of physical confinement and chemical adsorption, introducing catalytic action to convert polysulfides adsorbed on the surface of enclosed spaces into insoluble solid phases is an active strategy to fundamentally reduce the shuttle of polysulfides [29,30]. Therefore, developing LSBs catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity, designing catalytic electrode structures, evaluating catalytic effects, revealing the pathways and rate control steps of electrochemical reactions, providing a theoretical basis for catalyst optimization, and the development of new catalysts are innovative strategies to improve the performance and stability of lithium sulfur battery systems [31,32]. MXene materials can be used to construct confined spaces and achieve physical confinement of polysulfides due to their two-dimensional (2D) geometric structural characteristics and metallic like conductivity [33,34]. In addition, M transition metal elements and adjustable surface functional group modifications exhibit strong chemical adsorption ability towards polar polysulfides [35–37]. By combining with MXene, the utilization rate of sulfur is significantly improved, and the shuttle effect is also suppressed to a certain extent [38]. However, MXene materials are prone to spontaneous stacking due to interlayer van der Waals forces, making it difficult to achieve rapid electrolyte mass transfer, resulting in slow transport of substances involved in the reaction, which limits the construction and performance of catalytic electrodes [39,40]. Therefore, it is urgent to explore how to design the geometric configuration of MXene catalytic electrodes based on the lithium-sulfur chemical reaction process, effectively synergize the physical confinement, chemical adsorption, and catalytic functions of MXene, and suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides [41,42]. In this paper, with the help of ice template assisted freeze drying technology, MXene aerogel lithium sulfur catalytic electrode with a guide pore structure was constructed. Through the rational design of MXene spatial geometry, the conversion kinetics of polysulfides was optimized, the energy density and cycle stability of the battery were comprehensively improved, and the development of LSBs technology towards higher performance and longer life was promoted. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of MXene aerogel electrodes with structure design Based on the occurrence of liquid polysulfides in the lithium sulfur chemical reaction process, it is necessary to design a functional confined reaction space to optimize the lithium sulfur reaction kinetics process. In this work, ice template assisted freeze drying technology was utilized to construct MXene aerogel with ion transport channel as the host of S. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the MXene nanosheet dispersion was prepared by in-situ etching with hydrochloric acid/lithium fluoride, with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and a size of approximately 200–500 nm. In order to enhance the structural stability and electronic conductivity of MXene aerogels, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypyrrole (PPy) were introduced to crosslink MXene nanosheets. With the help of semiconductor cooler, the directional pre-freezing is realized, and then with the help of freeze-drying technology, PPy-PVA-Ti3C2T x (PPy-P-Ti3C2T x ) MXene aerogel with a guide channel structure is obtained. Fig. S1 presents the digital photograph of the corresponding radial freezing process. Fig. 1(b and c) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) basic characterization data of MXene nanosheets. Fig. S2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2T x . Fig. S3 is selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Ti3C2T x MXene. To investigate the effect of PVA and PPy on the dispersion of MXene. The Zeta potential test of the dispersed liquids of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x was performed. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the electronegativity of Ti3C2T x MXene dispersion is −42.03 mV. After the introduction of PVA, its Zeta potential was −37.23 mV, while the Zeta potential of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x , after PPy was continued to be introduced, was −23.63 mV. Introducing a low amount of polymer can still maintain the charge environment of MXene dispersion. The microstructure and composition of the aerogel electrode were visually obtained by SEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) tests (Figs. S4 and S5). As shown in Fig. 1(e and f), the microstructure and composition of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x MXene aerogel electrodes were obtained directly by SEM and EDS, which showed that the sulfur was uniformly attached without aggregation after the drip of the sulfur source. The illustration shows that the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x @Li2S8 aerogel has a multistage porous structure. Fig. S6 shows the uniform distribution of dropwise Li2S8 liquid on T3C2T x and PVA-T3C2T x . Fig. S7 shows the channel size distribution information of Ti3C2T x and PVA-Ti3C2T x . The density of the obtained PPy-P-Ti3C2T x MXene aerogel (diameter and height) is 43.17 kg m−3, which can be placed on the dandelion flower without obvious deformation. Fig. 1(g) shows the cross section optical image of the obtained PPy-P-Ti3C2T x MXene aerogel. It can be seen that its thickness is about 1.64 mm, and it has a channel perpendicular to the electrode surface. The structural evolution of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x aerogel was characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). After MXene was compounded with PVA and PPy, the (002) peaks of Ti3C2T x MXene shift to a lower angle owing to PVA and PPy polymers acting as intercalators, inhibiting the restacking of MXene, in favour of more active sites and space to accommodate adsorption and conversion of polysulfides. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra are shown in Fig. 2(b and c). The characteristic Raman peaks at 256.1, 410.4, and 606.0 cm−1 can be attributed to the Ti–C bond of MXene. The peak at 150.1 cm−1 originates from the Ti–O bond of the surface functional group of MXene. The peak in the PVA at about 3000 cm−1 is attributed to the CH stretching. FTIR further confirmed the surface functional groups and interactions between the introduced polymers and MXene. Vibration peaks of OH, CO, OH, TiF, and TiO bonds were observed at 3444, 1600, 1383, 1353, and 574 cm−1. The characteristic peaks of hydrophilic PVA at 3431, 1438, 1355, and 1276 cm−1 are derived from OH, CH, OH, and CO bond vibrations, respectively. The characteristic peaks at 3430, 1635, 1598, 1393, and 1165 cm−1 of PPy correspond to NH, CC, NH (in-plane), CH, and CN vibrations. The presence of OH bond at 1367 cm−1 in Ti3C2T x /PVA aerogel indicates hydrogen bonding. In addition, the π-π interaction can be observed between the polymerized PPy/PVA and Ti3C2T x . The characteristic peak at 3458 cm−1 shows a red shift and peak deformation compared to PPy, which is caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds. As shown in Fig. 2(d), Ti, C, O, and F elements are representing Ti3C2T x MXene, while PPy-P-Ti3C2T x shows an additional N element. Ti 2p (Fig. 2e) was fitted, corresponding to OTiO, TiF, TiOH, TiO, and TiC, respectively. The enhancement characteristic peak of OTiO can be attributed to the partial oxidation. The Ti shifts to a lower binding energy, which is due to the increased electron cloud density caused by hydrogen bonding between the surface functional groups (OH, O, and F) of MXene and hydroxyl and NH groups in the polymer, indicating the hydrogen bonding interaction between MXene and the polymer. Therefore, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure shows strong stability. Fig. 2(f) is schematic description of the interfacial interaction between PPy, PVA, and MXene flakes. As shown in Fig. 2(g), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas obtained from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x are 32.74, 23.39, and 96.49 m2 g−1, respectively. The illustration shows the pore size structure distribution. The decreased specific surface area of PVA-Ti3C2T x may be caused by PVA cross-linking MXene. The micropore and mesopore of MXene aerogel are filled or covered by a large amount of PVA. The joint introduction of PVA and PPy increases the specific surface area, breaking the cross-linking and recombination of PVA. PPy is of great significance in improving the dispersion of MXene and preventing the re-accumulation of Ti3C2T x MXene. A high specific surface area in the electrode means that the abundance of active sites directly affects its electrochemical performance. The pore volumes of Ti3C2T x and PVA-Ti3C2T x are 0.23 and 0.12 cm3 g−1, while PPy-P-Ti3C2T x has a larger pore volume of 0.49 cm3 g−1. A large specific surface area and diverse pore structure can increase the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby shortening the ion diffusion path, alleviating the expansion of electrode volume during charging and discharging, and improving capacitance performance [43]. In Fig. 2(h), to clearly understand polysulfide interaction, a visual static adsorption experiment was conducted. A 0.2 mol L−1 Li2S6 solution was chosen as the model polar adsorbate for static adsorption. The color of solutions containing the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x changes to light obviously. Quantitative analysis of the LiPSs was provided by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic measurements. The observed peak intensity of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x was the lowest. These phenomena indicate that the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x is highly adsorptive to the polysulfides species. The information obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can further understand the adsorption process of the interaction between polysulfides and composite materials. As illustrated in Fig. S8, semi-quantitative analysis of XPS data revealed the atomic percentage content of LiO bond, LiS bond, and TiC bond during the charging and discharging process. Additionally, the total XPS spectra following the adsorption of Li2S6 by Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrodes show the atomic percentage content of each atom. These findings indicate that the electron transfer process is reversible, suggesting that the catalytic process remains stable and sustainable across multiple consecutive heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The contact angle of the electrolyte on the surface of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode is almost 0°, indicating that the surface of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode has good wettability, which is conducive to electrolyte mass transfer process (Fig. 2i). 2.2 Kinetics of polysulfide conversion Fig. 3 (a) shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at 0.1 mV s−1 in the range of 1.7–2.7 V. Two reduction peaks appear at 1.98 and 2.34 V on the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode. The reduction peak at 1.98 V corresponds to the process of S8 reduction to generate Li2S n , while the reduction peak at 2.34 V belongs to the conversion process of Li2S n to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. The oxidation peak at 2.38 V corresponds to the process of Li2S2/Li2S being oxidized to S8. It can be seen that the polarization potential (ΔE) of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode is 0.40 V, which is lower than 0.60 V of Ti3C2T x and 0.50 V of PVA-Ti3C2T x , indicating that the introduction of PPy can reduce the conversion barrier of polysulfides, which is consistent with the overpotential trend reflected in galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves. In the first 5 cycles of the CV curve (Fig. S9), there is a shift of the redox peak, which is owing to the formation of an SEI film. However, during the subsequent cycles, the CV curve shape of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x remained consistent, indicating that the material has good cycling stability and redox reversibility. This indicates that the diverse pore structure is stable and can effectively encapsulate the active substance sulfur and facilitate chemical adsorption, greatly reducing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The diffusion process of lithium ions directly affects the conversion process of polysulfides. As shown in Fig. 3(b and c) and Fig. S10, the diffusion rate of Li+ can be calculated based on the relevant parameters of the CV curve at different scanning rates, referring to the Randles Sevick formula. The fitted curves based on the relationship of Ip-v 1/2 at different scan rates exhibit a linear relationship during the electrochemical reaction process, and the D Li + is directly reflected by the slope of the curves. Fig. S11 shows the diffusion rate of Li+ of Ti3C2T x and PVA-Ti3C2T x according to the relevant parameters of CV curve at different scanning rates. Comparing the Ip-v 1/2 slopes, it can be seen that the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x has the highest lithium ion diffusion coefficient during the redox reaction process, further revealing that polysulfides have the fastest migration rate and conversion kinetics. This is because the diverse pore structure provides more pathways for ion diffusion, while also accelerating the conversion process of polysulfides. In Fig. 3(d), the capacitance contribution from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1 is calculated based on the voltage and current response (j p = Av 1/2 + Bv). As the scanning speed increased, the capacitance effect gradually dominated the contribution in the total capacity. Among them, PPy-P-Ti3C2T x has a higher pseudocapacitive effect, with the increased contribution rate of capacitive effect. Understanding the electrode charge storage mechanism and reaction kinetics is of great significance for further developing the high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Fig. S12 shows the linear relationship between log(i) and log(v) of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrodes. In order to compare the differences in the effects of three electrocatalysts on the reaction kinetics of sulfur electrodes in LSBs, it was found after zooming in the local CV curves of the three curves (Fig. S13) that the CV curves of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode have higher reduction potential and lower oxidation potential. Tafel curves are calculated, as shown in Fig. 3(e), and their slope values were compared. It was found that the Tafel curve of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode has a smaller slope, indicating a higher exchange current density. This means that a lower reaction barrier of the sulfur redox reaction [44]. The conversion from liquid Li2S4 to solid Li2S is the rate limiting step in discharge process, requiring a high reaction energy barrier. However, the capacity provided by this process accounts for 75% of the entire discharge capacity. Therefore, using electrocatalysts to accelerate the nucleation and deposition of Li2S is beneficial for improving the overall discharge capacity. The nucleation and deposition processes of Li2S strongly depend on the properties of the reaction interface. In order to evaluate the regulatory effect on the Li2S deposition process, constant potential discharge experiments were conducted using chronoamperometry (CA) technology, and the i-t curves in Fig. 3(f and g) were obtained. The current peak in the curve is generated during the Li2S deposition process. Based on the integrated area of the curve, the capacity provided by Li2S deposition can be calculated. The curve can be split and fitted into three parts, representing the three reaction processes. The processes of converting Li2S6 to Li2S4, Li2S8 to Li2S6, and Li2S4 to Li2S accord with the filling color from dark to light [45]. On the surface of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x , the deposition capacity of Li2S is 131.5 mAh g−1, which is much larger than the deposition capacity on PVA-Ti3C2T x electrodes (23 mAh g−1). As shown in Fig. S14, the deposition time of Li2S of Ti3C2T x is the latest. In addition, when depositing on the surface of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x , the current peak is narrower, the peak current is stronger, and the peak time is shorter. These results indicate that the surface of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x is more favorable for the deposition of Li2S. This indicates that the introduction of PPy regulates the plane of Ti3C2T x and enhances its catalytic ability for the conversion of polysulfides, which promotes the reaction kinetics process of the entire sulfur cathode. Fig. S15 shows the dissolution profiles of Li2S with Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x . For Li2S decomposition, the Ti3C2T x and PVA-Ti3C2T x electrodes (98.38 and 178.31 mAh g−1) exhibited smaller deposition capacities than the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrodes (439.63 mAh g−1). The results show that the electrocatalyst of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode has a higher efficiency in promoting the decomposition of Li2S. These results clearly show that the structure of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode not only promotes the deposition of Li2S during discharge, but also accelerates the decomposition of Li2S during charging. Therefore, the reaction kinetics of the whole sulfur cathode is promoted. Impressively, MXene can catalyze the conversion of LiPSs through the 2D surface and M, not only avoiding the LiPSs shuttling but also ensuring a faster electron transfer/Li+ supplementation upon the charge/discharge process (Fig. 3h). Fig. 3(i) shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements and equivalent circuit fitting. The charge transfer resistance (R ct) at the corresponding electrode/polysulfide interface showed that the semicircle diameters of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x decreased sequentially. This indicates that during the multiphase conversion process, the accumulation of LiPSs in PPy-P-Ti3C2T x batteries is greatly suppressed, and the migration resistance of charges on the electrode surface is the smallest. The impedance of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x is significantly lower, indicating its fast charge transfer dynamics, which is attributed to the 3D conductive network ensuring sufficient electron transfer. The slope of the low-frequency straight line of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x is relatively large, indicating a faster diffusion rate of lithium ions. This is mainly due to the constructed 3D network skeleton and porous structure providing channels for ion diffusion and shortening the path of ion transport, and the good wettability between the electrolyte and porous structure, which is also conducive to the rapid transmission of lithium ions. Therefore, the rapid electron/ion transfer of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x enhances the electrochemical reaction kinetics, namely the polysulfide conversion kinetics, exhibiting excellent rate performance and cycling stability. Fig. 4 (a) compares GCD curves. PPy-P-Ti3C2T x achieves a lower overpotential (179.5 mV) than Ti3C2T x (346.9 mV) or PVA-Ti3C2T x (324.3 mV), indicating that the introduction of PPy can reduce the nucleation barrier of soluble Li2S4 to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. In addition, the discharge process can be divided into two parts: the high voltage region (2.4–2.06 V) corresponding to the reduction process of S8 to Li2S4 (solid-liquid conversion) and the low voltage region (2.06–1.7 V) corresponding to the deposition process of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S [46]. At 0.2 C, PPy-P-Ti3C2T x has a Q H capacity contribution of 376.35 mAh g−1 and Q L of 847.08 mAh g−1, demonstrating that PPy-P-Ti3C2T x can effectively adsorb polysulfides and reduce the reaction energy barrier to suppress the shuttle effect in LSBs. Fig. S16 shows a comparison of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode platform capacities. It can be found that the capacity Q L/Q H of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x aerogel cathode is larger than that of Ti3C2T x and PVA-Ti3C2T x . This suggests that PPy-P-Ti3C2T x aerogel cathodes promoted the conversion of soluble Li2S4 to insoluble Li2S. Fig. 4(b) shows the discharge capacities of Ti3C2T x , PVA-Ti3C2T x , and PPy-P-Ti3C2T x from 0.1 to 2 C (1 C = 1675 mA). Thanks to the introduction of PPy and the comprehensive advantages of pore structure design, PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode has demonstrated excellent capacity, especially at high current densities. Its specific capacity is more than 5 times higher than others. This indicates the stable reversibility of the electrochemical conversion reaction. GCD curves at different currents are shown in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S17. Fig. 4(d) shows cycling performance of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x with a sulfur load of 1.1 mg cm−2 at 0.2 C. The initial discharge specific capacity is 1223.43 mAh g−1, and the discharge specific capacity after 600 cycles is 679.11 mAh g−1. The capacity retention rate is 55.5%, and the average capacity degradation rate for each cycle is only 0.074%, with Coulombic efficiency being over 99%. Fig. S18 shows GCD curves with different number of cycles. Furthermore, the long-term cycle performance of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x cathode is evaluated at 1 C, as shown in Fig. S19. The initial three cycles are conducted at a low current density to ensure the uniform and complete nucleation of LiPSs. The specific discharge capacity reaches 813.25 mAh g−1 at the fourth cycle and remains stable at 569.06 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, with high Coulombic efficiency and low-capacity decay (0.15% per cycle). Fig. S20 shows cycle performance and the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x cathode with a sulphur loading of 4.2 mg cm−2 at 0.05 C. The battery exhibits a desirable initial capacity of 467.11 mAh g−1. Fig. 4(e) shows the Li-S battery diagram. Fig. S21 shows the CV curve after cycling, indicating good electrode stability. In addition, to directly reveal the kinetics of liquid-liquid reactions, we conducted CV tests in a symmetric battery containing Li2S6 cathode electrolyte (Fig. S22). To further explore the mechanism by which LiPSs react on PPy-P-Ti3C2T x , we measured XPS at selected states of the charge/discharge process (Fig. S23). Fig. 4(f) shows the XPS spectrum of Ti 2p, where 463.95 and 459.03 eV, 463.26 and 457.89 eV, 462.34 and 456.97 eV, 461.60 and 456.07 eV, and 460.72 and 455.24 eV correspond to OTiO, TiF, TiOH, TiO, and TiC, respectively. The binding energy of Ti element shifts towards low binding energy during discharge and then reversibly towards high binding energy during charging, indicating that Ti has chemical stability and reversibility during catalytic conversion. Fig. 4(g) and Fig. S24 show the XPS spectrum of O 1s, Li 1s, and S 2p. During the discharge process, the binding energy of O 1s shifts toward higher binding energy, while the binding energy of Li 1s moves toward lower binding energy. During the charging process, O 1s moves towards the low binding energy, while Li 1s moves towards the high binding energy, indicating the charge interaction between Li+ and the oxygen atom with lone pair electrons. The PPy-P-Ti3C2T x structure can effectively catalyze sulfur species conversion by forming TiS and LiO bonds, avoiding shuttle phenomena and ensuring faster electron transfer and Li+ supplementation during charge/discharge. The chemical interaction and catalytic behavior between polysulfide and MXene were verified by the XPS spectra of S 2p. The XPS of S 2p can be divided into LiS, SS, metalS, thiosulfate, and polythiosulfate peaks. At a full discharge of 1.7 V, the increase in the LiS peak area indicates the conversion of polysulfide to Li2S. When charged to 2.7 V, the LiS peak area decreases, indicating the reversible transformation of sulfur species. This phenomenon is consistent with the above electrochemical properties, nucleation and transformation of sulfur species. Fig. 4(h) shows the Nyquist plot obtained after electrode cycling, with a significant decrease in the semicircle in the high-frequency region, indicating a denser contact inside the electrode after cycling. At the same time, the charge transfer resistance of the PPy-P-Ti3C2T x electrode is significantly lower than that of the PVA-Ti3C2T x and Ti3C2T x electrodes. In addition, the cycling performance of PPy-P-Ti3C2T x is superior to that of some previously reported cathodes, as shown in Fig. S25 and Table S1 [6,15,16,47–52]. 3 Conclusions In general, based on the reaction path of polysulfides in lithium sulfur reaction and the geometric structure and catalytic function of MXene materials, we constructed MXene catalytic electrode with specific orientation by using the ice template assisted freeze drying technology, and strengthened the structural stability of MXene aerogel by introducing PPy as a polymer stabilizer with the help of hydrogen bond correlation. The structure oriented MXene aerogel catalytic electrode can achieve a high capacity performance improvement and cycle stability improvement by virtue of the synergistic effect of confined spatial structure, adsorption, and catalytic active sites. In addition, this method provides an innovative path for constructing MXene electrodes with directional channel structures. It also provides comprehensive design guidance for the construction of lithium sulfur catalytic electrodes. Experimental section Experimental details can be found in the Supporting Information.

        "dc:description": "The lithium-sulfur reaction can contribute to the chemical electrical energy conversion capacity due to the multi-level ion/electron transfer process. However, the appearance of soluble intermediate products prevents efficient electron transfer, making it impossible to achieve stable cycling and capacity contribution. Restricted catalysis provides a solution for inhibiting the shuttle of soluble lithium polysulfides. Herein, MXene aerogel with optimized channel utilization is designed as S host according to the polysulfide control strategy of localization, adsorption, and catalysis. With the help of the results of oriented channels, the polysulfide conversion process is optimized, providing a comprehensive scheme for inhibiting the shuttle effect. Lithium sulfur catalytic batteries have achieved high capacity and stable cycling. This system provides a comprehensive solution for lithium sulfur reaction catalysis and a new perspective for the functional application of MXene based lithium sulfur batteries.",
