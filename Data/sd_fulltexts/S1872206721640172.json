Stable and high-efficiency bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are desired for the practical application of Li-O2 batteries with excellent rate performance and cycle stability. Herein, a novel hybrid bifunctional catalyst with carbon nanofibers inlaid with hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles and separate active sites for ORR and OER were prepared and applied in Li-O2 batteries. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of unique porous structural features and high electrocatalytic activity of hollow Co3O4 intimately bound to N-doped carbon nanofibers, the assembled Li-O2 batteries with novel catalyst exhibited high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and cycle stability up to 150 cycles under a capacity limitation of 500 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The facile synthesis and preliminary results in this work show the as-prepared catalyst as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for applications in metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and electrocatalysis. Graphical abstract A high-performance bifunctional catalyst with separated active sites for the ORR and OER was developed for rechargeable Li-O2 batteries. Owing to their unique design, the assembled Li-O2 batteries exhibit excellent rate capability and cycling stability. Keywords Li-O2 batteries Bifunctional catalyst Co3O4 N-doped carbon nanofibers Oxygen reduction reaction Oxygen evolution reaction 1 Introduction It is well recognized that global warming and air pollution can be mitigated once fossil fuel-powered engines in vehicles are replaced by environmentally friendly technologies such as electromotors, which can be powered by proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), supercapacitors, or rechargeable batteries [1–4]. Among these electrochemical energy devices, lithium oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered to be one of the most attractive energy storage and conversion devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, which is several times higher than that of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries and is comparable to that of gasoline engines [5,6]. However, in practice, the achieved capacity and energy density of Li-O2 batteries are normally lower than expected. In addition, neither the rate capability nor the round-trip efficiency is satisfactory [7,8]. Catalyst performance in Li-O2 batteries has been identified as the dominant factor owing to the sluggish kinetics in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes [9–11]. Therefore, stable and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER are desired for the practical application of Li-O2 batteries. In recent years, many nanomaterials have been explored to find a high-efficiency and stable catalyst for the ORR and OER processes, such as noble metals, transition metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and their composites [12,13]. Among these electrocatalysts, earth-abundant transition metal oxides have attracted increasing attention; in particular, Co3O4 has been extensively studied as a catalyst for Li-O2 batteries because of its environmental friendliness and low cost [14–18]. However, a common problem with metal oxides is that Co3O4 exhibits a relatively low electronic conductivity. Furthermore, carbon materials, because of their high stability, good electronic conductivity, and easy control of desired porous architectures, are very attractive materials and have been widely used in electrochemical devices as conductive additives and catalyst supports [19–23]. Huang et al. [19] prepared a hybrid electrode composed of a Co3O4/carbon nanotubes/carbon fiber (Co3O4/CNTs/CFP) catalyst, which could deliver a discharge capacity of 7196.5 mAh g−1 and 25 stable cycles with a capacity restriction of 1000 mAh g−1 obtained at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Zhang's group [20] synthesized oxygen-defective amorphous-crystalline CoO nanosheets through a vacuum-calcination strategy, which exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for both ORR and OER. Additionally, they fabricated CoPt nanoparticles anchored on the surface of OH- and NH2-functionalized porous carbon using a sol-gel method. Li-O2 batteries with a CoPt/activated functional carbon cathode exhibited a high discharge specific capacity of 8.25 mAh cm−2 and a long cycle stability of 156 cycles with a limited capacity of 0.2 mAh cm−2 [21]. Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that nitrogen-doped carbon materials can improve electrochemical properties owing to changes in the chemical and electronic properties of carbon-based materials, such as the formation of defects and functional groups derived from heteroatom doping [24–27]. Yan et al. [24] used DFT calculations to show that N-doping could boost the adsorption of oxygen atoms and reduce the energy barrier of oxygen molecular dissociation from 2.39 to 1.20 eV, resulting in better catalytic activity toward ORR and OER. Li et al. [25] verified that N-doped graphene nanosheets can exhibit discharge capacities of 11660, 6640, and 3960 mA g−1 at current densities of 75, 150, and 300 mA g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of electrodes made of bare graphene nanosheets. Additionally, many studies have suggested that a stable air cathode with proper porous structures can facilitate the storage of discharge products, oxygen diffusion, and electrolyte wettability, resulting in excellent cycling performance, round-trip efficiency, and rate capability [28–32]. For example, Jiang et al. [28] prepared Co3O4 nanocages via metal-organic framework derivatization. The Co3O4 nanocage has the most complete skeleton and porosity of ZIF-67 and exhibits some oxygen vacancies. Benefiting from the unique structure and active sites, the Co3O4 nanocage catalyst stably delivered an ultrahigh specific capacity of 15500 mAh g−1 and can exhibit a long life of 132 cycles with a limited discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 at a charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A g−1. Herein, we employed a facile approach to design and prepare a hybrid bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and OER in Li-O2 batteries. The hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles were inlaid in porous and highly graphitized N-doped carbon nanofibers (H-Co3O4-CNFs). According to the design, the naked Co3O4 may be active sites for OER, while the remaining (inlaid) content of Co3O4 together with the porous N-doped carbon nanofibers can electrocatalyze the ORR process. Thus, the ORR and OER active sites in a bifunctional catalyst are separated at the nanoscale, resulting in separated active sites for the ORR and OER during the discharging and charging processes. The bifunctional catalyst with separated active sites is expected to facilitate the decomposition of discharge products, which are insoluble and insulative in non-aqueous electrolytes. In addition, the as-prepared porous and highly graphitized carbon substrate has at least two advantages: (1) mesopores can facilitate O2 diffusion and electrolyte penetration throughout the porous N-doped carbon nanofibers; (2) N-doping and high graphitization can boost the electronic conductivity of carbon materials. 2 Experimental 2.1 Fabrication of H-Co3O4-CNFs H-Co3O4-CNFs were prepared by electrospinning, as illustrated in Scheme 1 . For comparison, Co-CNFs and bare CNFs were prepared using similar processes. The detailed synthesis procedure is as follows: First, 0.4 g cobalt (II) acetate anhydrous (Co(AC)2) and 0.8 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were mixed in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). After 12 h of continuous stirring, a red precursor with a high viscosity was obtained. Then, the as-prepared liquid precursor was loaded into a plastic syringe for spinning. A piece of 30 × 40 cm clean aluminum foil was used as the collector during spinning. The applied voltage was controlled at 10.0 kV. At the end of the spinning process, the obtained fibers on the aluminum foil were transferred to an oven at 80 °C for drying for more than 12 h. Subsequently, the dried fibers were first annealed in air at 300 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then the fibers were further annealed in an Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to form Co-CNFs (Co nanoparticles inlaid in carbon nanofibers). Finally, the Co-CNFs were transferred into H-Co3O4-CNFs after heating in air at 300 °C for 5 h. The H-Co3O4-CNFs catalysts prepared with 0.4, 0.2, and 0.6 g Co(AC)2 reagent were denoted as H-Co3O4-CNFs (or H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.4), H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.2, H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.6, respectively. 2.2 Characterization The morphology and structure of the catalyst samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NANO430 and Regulus SU8100) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu Kα = 0.15406 nm). More specific structural details were obtained using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F). Analysis of the material composition depends on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which was carried out on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα radiation. Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRam Aramis Raman system (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 632.8 nm laser as the excitation source. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using a NETZSCH STA44C instrument. The operation was performed from 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the catalyst samples were measured using a surface area and pore size analyzer (ASAP 2460) under a nitrogen atmosphere (adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K). 2.3 Electrochemical tests The electrocatalytic performances of all samples were investigated using a standard three-electrode cell, in which a graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared as follows: A catalyst ink was prepared by adding 4.9 mg of catalyst powder to a solution made of 990 µL ethanol and 10 µL 5% Nafion solution. After 10 min of sonication, 18 µL of the as-prepared ink was deposited on a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with a disk area of 0.196 cm2 and a ring area of 0.237 cm2. The total mass loading was calculated to be approximately 0.45 mg cm−2. To extract the kinetic parameters of ORR on catalysts, the kinetic parameter (transferred electron number) can be further calculated based on the disk current and ring current using the following equation [3]: n = 4I d/(I d + I r/N), where I d is the disk current, I r is the ring current, and N is the collection efficiency. 2.4 Li-O2 cells assembly and characterization The oxygen cathode was fabricated by soaking nickel foam in a homogeneous catalyst slurry and then drying at 80 °C for 12 h. Generally, a homogeneous slurry was prepared by mixing 60 wt% of catalyst, 30 wt% of Ketjenblack carbon (KB), and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. The mass loading of the slurry on the electrode was approximately 0.5 mg cm−2. All coin cells (porous 2032 coin cells) were assembled in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere. Glass fiber (Whatman®) membranes and Li foil were used as the separator and anode, respectively. LiTFSI (1.0 mol/L) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) electrolyte was employed as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic discharge-charge tests were carried out with a Battery Testing System (Neware) between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex) at a potential range from 2.0 to 4.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) at 0.2 mV s−1. All measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The polymeric nanofiber precursors were electrospun and subsequently subjected to thermal treatment (Scheme 1); thus, the cobalt salt was first decomposed and then reduced to metallic Co. The metallic Co was finally oxidized in air at a mild temperature to form Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles inlaid in the CNFs (denoted as H-Co3O4-CNFs). In addition, N-doped carbon materials can be prepared by heating a composite of carbon materials and nitrogen-containing materials in an inert atmosphere [26,27]. Because nitrogen is contained in polyacrylonitrile (PAN), N-doped carbon fibers are expected to be formed in this process. The crystalline structures of all samples were determined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . Typically, the collected diffraction peak at approximately 25° can be indexed to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon, which can be observed in all three patterns. After annealing in an Ar atmosphere, the diffraction peaks around 44°, 52°, and 76° are consistent with the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Co (PDF#15-0806), respectively [27]. This indicates that polymeric precursors are carbonized, and metallic cobalt is formed after thermal treatment in Ar. After calcination at 300 °C in air for 5 h, the diffraction peaks of metallic Co disappeared, and new diffraction peaks at 19°, 31°, 36°, 45°, 59°, and 65° were observed, which can be assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of Co3O4 (PDF#42-1467), respectively [28,30]. This demonstrates that metallic Co can be transferred into Co3O4 after thermal treatment in air at a mild temperature. To further determine the mass ratio of Co3O4 in the final sample, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a precursor of H-Co3O4-CNFs in an air atmosphere. The results shown in Fig. 1(b) demonstrate two major weight losses starting at 25 and 300 °C, respectively. The first weight loss (approximately 8%) can be ascribed to the evaporation of water, while the second weight loss (53.3%) is likely due to the decomposition of organics or the oxidation of carbon. As the TGA measurement was conducted until 800 °C, and there was no notable weight loss, the Co3O4 mass ratio in the H-Co3O4-CNFs was determined to be 38.7%. XPS analysis of H-Co3O4-CNFs showed that only C, N, O, and Co were observed, as shown in Fig. 2(a) , indicating low contamination. The C 1s spectrum in Fig. 2(b) can be divided into three peaks at 284.5, 285.1 and 286.4 eV, which can be assigned to graphitic carbon (C–C), carbon in C–N and C–O, and carbon in C=O, respectively [33]. In addition, pyridinic (N-6, 398.7 eV), pyrrolic (N-5, 400.2 eV), and quaternary (N-Q, 401.3 eV) nitrogen are shown in Fig. 2(c) [34]. The contents of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and quaternary N were 42.9%, 32.4%, and 24.7%, respectively. In Fig. 2(d), the two strongest peaks centered at 781.3 and 796.9 eV can be assigned to Co2+ 2p 3/2 and Co2+ 2p 1/2, and the peaks centered at 780.4 and 795.0 eV can be assigned to Co3+ 2p 3/2 and Co3+ 2p 1/2, respectively. In addition, two weak satellite peaks were observed in the higher binding energy side of the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 transitions, indicating the co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ on the surface of the H-Co3O4-CNFs. These features further confirmed the formation of the Co3O4 phase. [28,30] Moreover, the XPS profiles of H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.2, H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.6, and CNFs were also obtained. As shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1, the content of pyridinic N and the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ in H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.4 was higher than that in other materials. It should be pointed out that N-doped carbon nanofibers with a high content of pyridinic nitrogen should have a high ORR catalytic activity because the carbon atoms with Lewis basicity adjacent to pyridinic N are generally considered to be the highly active sites for ORR in N-doped carbon materials [35]. Moreover, the high ratio of Co2+/Co3+ describes more oxygen vacancies due to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+, which generates more free electrons to promote the adsorption of oxygen molecules [31]. Thus, the H-Co3O4-CNFs prepared with 0.4 g Co(AC)2 reagent possess optimal electronic structures. The morphology and structure of all prepared samples were first investigated by SEM, and the results are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the Co-CNFs had a smooth surface, while the surface of the H-Co3O4-CNFs was roughened after heat treatment and presented an evident porous characteristic. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured to analyze the pore properties, as shown in Fig. S3. The typical hysteresis loop of type-IV verifies a mesoporous structure inside the sample, which is consistent with the mesoporous structure observed in the SEM images in Figs. S2(c) and (d). Further BET measurements (Fig. S3(a)) showed that the surface area of the H-Co3O4-CNFs was approximately 372.63 m2 g−1. The mesoporous size distribution calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method is centered at 4 nm (Fig. S3(b)), which is favorable for the diffusion of oxygen and penetration of the electrolyte in the air electrode. However, the H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.2, H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.6, and CNFs have unsatisfactory BET surface areas and pore volumes (Figs. S3(c)–(h), Table S2). According to the thermal reaction process of preparing materials, a small amount of Co3O4 nanoparticles embedded in carbon fibers may result in a very small pore structure; however, too many Co3O4 nanoparticles lead to particle agglomeration, which may hinder gas diffusion and mass transfer. Thus, H-Co3O4-CNFs embedded with an appropriate concentration of Co3O4 nanoparticles have a large specific surface area and pore volume, which can promote gas diffusion and mass transfer. The microstructures of all prepared samples were further revealed by TEM. The typical TEM images in Figs. 3(a)–(c) and the STEM images in Fig. S4 indicate that the Co3O4 nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 10 to 80 nm are distributed uniformly on the surface and/or partially inlaid in the porous carbon nanofibers and show a hollow morphology. Compared with the TEM images of Co-CNFs (Fig. S5), it can be confirmed that the formation of a hollow structure occurs during the heating treatment in air. A previous report suggested that the formation of a hollow structure was mainly attributed to the well-known Kirkendall effect: when metal nanoparticles are exposed to oxygen, the outward diffusion speed of the cations is much higher than that of the inward diffusion of the anions, leading to the formation of hollow voids inside the nanoparticles [36]. In addition, from Figs. 3(a)–(c), it can also be observed that, with the formation of the Co3O4 hollow structure, the carbon nanofibers also undergo structural transformation and show a typical porous morphology, which is likely due to the oxidative decomposition of non-graphitic carbon during the heat treatment process. The structural details of the Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles and porous carbon nanofibers were further identified by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). A single hollow Co3O4 nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 3(d), where the inset figure on the top-left highlights the spacing of the crystalline lattices of 0.245 and 0.463 nm, which can be indexed to the (311) and (111) planes of the Co3O4 phase, respectively. The inset figure in the top-right displays the clear spot and ring diffraction patterns, which are again indexed as the crystal structures of the Co3O4 phase. Fig. 3(e) indicates that the porous carbon nanofibers have a graphite-like layered structure. The measured spacing is 0.348 nm in Fig. 3(f), which matches well with the (002) plane of the graphite phase, confirming that the porous carbon nanofibers are composed of graphitized carbon. Raman spectroscopy was applied to analyze the influence of Co on the structure of the carbon nanofibers, and the results are shown in Fig. S6. The bands at 1348 and 1554 cm−1 are indexed to the typical carbon features of the D- and G-bands, respectively. The relative I G/I D values for CNFs and H-Co3O4-CNFs are 1.09 and 0.99, respectively, which suggests that more structural defect sites were constructed during high-temperature carbonization in inert atmosphere and following oxidation in air atmosphere [37,38]. It is well accepted that the suitable coexistence of defective and graphitic carbon leads to better electronic conductivity and enhanced activity of the carbon catalyst toward the ORR and OER. Simultaneously, because the non-graphitic carbon is easily burned off during thermal treatment in air, a large number of mesopores could be introduced into the carbon nanofibers, as shown in Fig. S7. To investigate the electrocatalytic properties of the H-Co3O4-CNFs for ORR, cyclic voltammograms in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution saturated with O2 and N2 were evaluated. For comparison, the electrochemical activities of the bare CNFs and commercial Pt/C were also evaluated. Fig. S8 shows typical CV curves of the three samples at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 within the potential range of 0.2–1.2 V (vs. RHE). Clearly, a cathodic peak was observed for the three samples when the solution was saturated with O2, indicating that all three samples exhibited ORR activities. For the bare CNFs catalyst, a broad cathodic peak centered at ~0.6 V with a reduction current density of 3.80 mA cm−2 was observed. For the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst, a sharp cathodic reduction peak centered at 0.76 V (vs. RHE) was observed, which is slightly negative compared to that of Pt/C (0.79 V). Interestingly, the reduction current density deviation between the O2-saturated and N2-saturated electrolytes for the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst (~4.10 mA cm−2) was significantly improved compared to that of Pt/C (~1.45 mA cm−2). These results clearly demonstrate that the H-Co3O4-CNFs have excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed at a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in O2-saturation with 0.1 mol/L KOH aqueous solutions at a rotating speed of 1600 r/min. The measured results are shown in Fig. 4(a) . The onset potential of the H-Co3O4-CNFs is approximately 0.93 V, which is significantly higher than that of the CNFs (0.76 V) and close to that of commercial Pt/C (0.95 V). This is consistent with the results observed in the CV test described above. It should be noted that the H-Co3O4-CNF electrocatalyst exhibits a 10 mV negative shift at the half-wave potential compared to the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst (0.81 and 0.82 V for H-Co3O4-CNFs and commercial Pt/C at the half-wave potential, respectively), while the H-Co3O4-CNFs exhibited a current density comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. The excellent catalytic performance of the H-Co3O4-CNFs for ORR can be attributed to the porous structure of graphitized CNFs (good electronic conductivity and rich mass transfer channels) and the synergistic effect of Co3O4 intimately bound to CNFs (rich and efficient active sites). To investigate the ORR kinetic process, the kinetic parameter (transferred electron number) was calculated according to the disk current and ring current (Fig. S9(a)). As shown in Fig. S9(b), the H-Co3O4-CNFs presented an ideal four-electron transfer pathway for oxygen reduction, which is similar to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The OER performances of the three samples were also evaluated by LSV measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential (1.49 V) and the highest oxygen evolution current, indicating that the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst has excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. Commercial Pt/C shows a low oxygen evolution current, which is notably different from the performance in the ORR process, suggesting that the excellent ORR electrocatalyst Pt/C cannot act as a bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER. A low OER current was also observed for the bare CNFs catalyst, indicating that the CNFs catalyst has poor performance toward both ORR and OER in the absence of Co3O4. In addition, the influence of different Co3O4 contents on the catalytic performance was investigated. Via a comparison of the ORR performance (Fig. S9(a)) and OER performance (Fig. S9(c)) of different catalyst samples, it can be clearly seen that the catalyst sample with 0.4 g Co(AC)2 as the raw material shows optimal catalytic performance. Such a dominant catalytic performance should be due to the higher Co3O4 utilization of H-Co3O4-CNFs, since the appropriate cobalt content leads to a more uniform dispersion and fewer sintered agglomerations of Co3O4 nanoparticles during carbonization. To evaluate the practical application of catalysts in Li-O2 batteries, full cells were assembled in a porous 2032 coin cell mold, as shown in Fig. S10. Full cells with a bare KB electrode and a CNFs/KB electrode were also assembled for comparison. Fig. 5(a) shows the CV curves obtained at a scanning rate of 0.2 mV s−1 within a voltage range of 2.0–4.5 V, where the reduction peak during the cathodic scan and the oxidation peak during the succeeding anodic scan correspond to the ORR and OER process, respectively [16,23,28]. Obviously, the Li-O2 cell with the H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB electrode exhibits higher ORR and OER currents and lower onset potential compared to that of Li-O2 cells with CNFs/KB electrode and KB electrode, indicating that the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst can facilitate the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 more efficiently. Fig. 5(b) exhibits the initial galvanostatic discharge-charge curves of three electrodes, namely, bare KB, CNFs/KB, and H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB, at a current density of 100 mA g−1 (based on the mass of KB). Clearly, the discharge, especially the charge voltage plateau, is significantly improved using H-Co3O4-CNFs as the air electrode. The Li-O2 battery based on H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB displays a stable discharge platform of ~2.6 V, which is higher than that of the bare KB electrode and CNFs/KB electrode by approximately 100–200 mV and is closer to the thermodynamic potential of the Li-O2 battery (2.96 V). Notably, the charge voltage plateau of the Li-O2 cell with the H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB electrode was found to be much lower than that of the KB electrode and CNFs/KB electrode by approximately 300 and 450 mV, respectively. As a result, the round-trip efficiency of the Li-O2 battery was improved and a lower overall overvoltage of 1.35 V can be achieved. These results suggest that the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst has a high catalytic activity for the ORR and OER, which is consistent with the RDE testing results discussed previously. In addition, in contrast to the KB and CNFs/KB electrodes, Li-O2 cells with H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst also showed higher specific capacity and capacity retention rate even at high current densities (Fig. S11). The synergistic effect of hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles intimately bound to N-doped CNFs on the ORR and OER processes, and the highly porous carbon structure might lead to the improved specific capacity and rate capability of Li-O2 cells (Figs. 5(c) and (d)). Fig. 5(e) shows the cyclic performance of H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB, CNFs/KB, and KB electrodes tested between 2.0 and 4.5 V at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The discharge product (mainly Li2O2) is insulating and insoluble and accumulates on the surface of the electrode. To improve the cyclic performance of Li-O2 cells, the discharge capacity during cycling must be limited to a certain value. Compared with the bare KB and CNFs/KB electrodes, the H-Co3O4-CNFs/KB electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability (Table S3) and can stably maintain a limited discharge capacity of 500 mAh g−1 for 150 cycles without any distinctive capacity fading. The CNFs/KB and KB electrodes can only run for 36 and 28 cycles under the same capacity restriction, respectively. Figs. 6(a)–(d) show the SEM images of the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst under different charge/discharge situations, and it is clear to see that the discharge products accumulate around the H-Co3O4-CNFs during the ORR process, but when the cell is charged, most of the discharge product is decomposed. The discharge products are mostly Li2O2 (PDF#09-0355), which is confirmed in Figs. 6(e)–(h). The excellent cyclic performance of the H-Co3O4-CNFs catalyst is likely related to available catalytic sites for the ORR and OER processes, where the ORR and OER active sites function alternately during the discharge and charge processes. Generally, the discharge products will accumulate around the ORR active sites and deactivate the catalyst during the charge process. While, there are available active sites that can participate in the catalysis reaction to consume and decompose the discharge products during the charge process because of the separated ORR and OER active sites on the unique bifunctional catalyst. Ultimately, the cyclic stability and round-trip efficiency could be significantly improved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the electronic interactions between Co3O4 and C, and the results are shown in Fig. S12 and S13. Fig. S12 shows the optimized structures of the pristine Co3O4 (311) surface, C surface, and C-modified Co3O4 (311) surface. Fig. S13 shows the charge density difference plots of the C-modified Co3O4 (311) surface, where the purple and yellow contours represent the charge accumulation and charge depletion, respectively. It can be seen that electron transfer occurs between Co3O4 (311) and C. In addition, the binding energies of the Li2O2 cluster on the active surfaces were further calculated, and the optimized adsorption structure and calculated results are shown in Fig. 7 and Table S4. Notably, the binding energy of the Li2O2 cluster on the C-modified Co3O4 (311) surface (–5.18 eV on the C site and –6.66 eV on the compound interface) is much lower than that of the clean Co3O4 (311) surface (–2.82 eV) and C surface (–4.43 eV), suggesting that the presence of C strengthened the preferential binding of the Li2O2 cluster on the compound interface of the C-modified Co3O4 (311). It is known that strong adsorption is favorable for Li2O2 species forming nanofilms on the substrate, thereby boosting the discharge process of Li-O2 batteries [18]. Thus, the C-modified Co3O4 (311) can stabilize the adsorption of the Li2O2 cluster on the surface to improve the performance of the Li-O2 battery, which is attributed to the electron interaction between Co3O4 (311) and carbon. 4 Conclusions We proposed a novel bifunctional catalyst concept in which the OER and ORR active sites are separated at the nanoscale. A model bifunctional electrocatalyst, where hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles were inlaid in N-doped porous carbon nanofibers was successfully prepared by a facile electrospinning process followed by thermal treatment. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the unique porous structural features and high electrocatalytic activity of hollow Co3O4 intimately bound to N-doped carbon nanofibers, an outstanding activity and electrochemical performance toward both ORR and OER processes under alkaline conditions was demonstrated. Moreover, Li-O2 batteries with H-Co3O4-CNFs as cathode catalysts exhibit good rate capability and cycling stability up to 150 cycles under a capacity limitation of 500 mAh g−1. The preliminary results suggest that the newly designed bifunctional catalyst concept is a promising strategy to remove the residual discharge products to achieve high round-trip efficiency, good rate capability, and excellent cycle performance in Li-O2 batteries. Furthermore, such unique electrode construction is also suitable for supercapacitors and fuel cells/electrolyzers.

        "dc:description": "Stable and high-efficiency bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are desired for the practical application of Li-O2 batteries with excellent rate performance and cycle stability. Herein, a novel hybrid bifunctional catalyst with carbon nanofibers inlaid with hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles and separate active sites for ORR and OER were prepared and applied in Li-O2 batteries. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of unique porous structural features and high electrocatalytic activity of hollow Co3O4 intimately bound to N-doped carbon nanofibers, the assembled Li-O2 batteries with novel catalyst exhibited high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and cycle stability up to 150 cycles under a capacity limitation of 500 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The facile synthesis and preliminary results in this work show the as-prepared catalyst as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for applications in metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and electrocatalysis.",
