Graphical abstract We have developed the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand/PdCl2 catalyst for CC coupling reaction of aryl iodides and organobismuths at room temperature. The established catalytic system exhibited high cross-coupling reactivity between a variety of orgnobismuths and aryl iodides in the presence of K2CO3 as base in NMP or DMSO at room temperature. The simple and efficient transformation can tolerate either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating functional groups. It was notably found that both aryl bromide and aryl chloride generated moderate to good yields of the corresponding biphenyl products using 5mol% of PPh3/ligand 5 (1:1) as catalyst. Keywords N-Heterocyclic carbene Triarylbismuths Cross-coupling Catalyst Palladium 1 Introduction The palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions is one of the most important reaction for CC bonds forming in synthetic organic chemistry [1]. Aryl-aryl bond formation is one of the most studied processes in cross-coupling chemistry such as the Suzuki-Miyaura [2], Stille [3], and Hiyama coupling reactions [4]. Recently, the use of bismuth-derived compounds as alternative reagents for the cross-coupling has attracted increasing attention [5–8]. Organobismuth compounds are emerging as prospective organometallic green reagents for coupling reaction in organi.synthesis due to low-level toxic, stable to air, and environmentally benign nature. The known palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of organobismuth compounds were performed under 80–130°C conditions with aryl halides [9,10]. Several protocols with a variety of ligands and palladium based on phosphines and amines are reported with promising reactivity in coupling reactions. For example, Yasunari Monguchi reported that a ligand-free 10% Pd/C-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between the aryl iodides and triarylbismuths by the addition of 2,2′-biquinoline in 120°C [11]. In 2010, Maddali L. N. Rao established a catalytic protocol using Pd(OAc)2(Cy2NH)2 system for the coupling reaction with a variety of triarylbismuth and aryl iodides under mild condition (35°C) [12]. Then, he unravelled an unprecedented cross-coupling of triarylbismuth reagents with aryl iodides under task specific Pd-Cu dual catalytic conditions in 2016 (Pd(OAc)2/CuI, dppf, DMF, 90°C, 4h) [13]. Although organobismuth compounds have been successfully utilized for the cross-coupling reaction, the studies are scarce in the literature for the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of organobismuth compounds with aryl halides. Thus, it is still desirable to develop inexpensive and efficient catalytic methods for the cross-coupling reaction using organobismuth reagents at the room temperature. As far as we know, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been extensively studied in the field of organometallics as ligands comparable to the conventional phosphine ligands capable of coordination with a wide range of transition metals [14]. N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are now regarded as an efficient catalyst as possible alternatives to pd–phosphine systems in the cross-coupling reaction [15]. Some highly active palladium systems with N-heterocyclic carbene ligands for the activation of aryl halides have been developed [16]. In 2016, C. Pichon reported the first cross-coupling reaction of Ar3Bi with Ar’X mediated by Pd-NHC-PPh3 (ratio PEPPSI IPr/PPh3: 1/1) in 90°C. Efforts were focussed on the rule of each additive such as PPh3 and the base. It was notably found that the presence of PPh3 was essential to keep the process efficient [17]. In this paper, we report the modular synthesis of an imidazolium salts based on benzo-9-crown-3 and a practical and efficient method for the cross-coupling reaction of aryl iodides with organobismuth catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbene-PdCl2 at the room temperature. 2 Experimental section 2.1 General procedures The compounds PdCl2(CH3CN)2 and Ar3Bi were prepared according to literature methods. All manipulations were performed using Schlenk techniques, and solvents were thoroughly dried and deoxygenated by standard methods. All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III HD 600MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts are expressed in ppm and are internally referenced. Positive-ion mass spectra were recorded by Bruker Impact II. All products were characterized by their 1H NMR and 13C NMR that were identical to those in the literature. 2.2 Synthesis of imidazolium salt ligand (5) 2.2.1 Preparation of 4-aldehyde-benzo-9-crown-3 (2) Aldehyde 1 (18.0g, 74mmol) was added to a suspension of powdered K2CO3 (20g, 147mmol) in DMF (500mL). After stirring under Ar at 90°C for 24h, the mixture was filtered and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residues were poured into water, the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2, washed with brine and dried with MgSO4. The combined organic phase was concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexanes: EtOAc 2:1) to afford the pure product 2 (7.0g, 45%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (600MHz, CDCl3, 25°C): 9.81 (s, 1H) 7.52 (d, 1H, J =1.93Hz), 7.47–7.49 (dd, 1H, J =1.93, 8.28Hz), 7.04 (d, 1H, J =8.28Hz), 4.61 (t, 2H, J =4.26Hz), 4.26 (t, 2H, J =4.36Hz), 3.86–3.91 (m, 4H)ppm; 13C NMR (125MHz, CDCl3, 25°C): δ =189.41, 155.86, 150.17, 130.88, 125.75, 123.88, 121.32, 74.19, 71.67, 70.95, 70.65ppm. Anal. Calcd for C11H12O4: C, 63.45; H, 5.81.

After the reaction time, the contents were quenched with 15mL water and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extract was washed with brine (15mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography to afford biaryl compounds. 3 Results and discussion The synthetic routes of the NHC-benzo-crown ether ligand (5) were demonstrated in Scheme 1 . Compound 1 was readily obtained by the alkylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and an excess of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether as described in previous literature [18]. We investigated synthetic strategy for preparing a mono-imidazolium salt based on benzo-9-crown-3. Cyclization of 1, carried out by base K2CO3 in DMF, yielded 4-aldehyde-benzo-9-crown-3 (2), TLC monitoring shows that an appropriate reaction time for 48h. Purification of the crude product from the reaction mixture using silica-gel chromatography afforded the product in 45% yield [19–21]. The aldehyde 2 was reduced following by NaBH4 in methanol to give 4-methanol-benzo-9-crown-3 (3), which brominated to mono-bromide 4, and subsequently transformed into mono-imidazolium salt 5. The structure of ligand 5 was established by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and X-ray. 1H NMR spectra of 5 in DMSO-d 6, the proton peak from the imidazolium (NCHN) was observed at 9.08ppm, which is consistent with the chemical shifts of known imidazolium salts [22]. The signals of salt 5 displays three resonances at 4.26, 4.24, 3.79ppm for the CH2O-ether groups, which reveal the molecular asymmetry. Yellow single crystals of salt 5 were obtained by a solution of diethyl ether and acetonitrile at room temperature (Fig. 1 ). The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21/c, and the X-ray structure was determined at 293K. The benzene and anthracene ring are respectively positioned on both sides of the imidazole ring, the dihedral angel of the two rings with imidazole ring are 87.9° and 83.5°, respectively. The initial reaction conditions were optimized using 4-iodonitrobenzene and triphenylbismuth as the model substrates under different bases, solvent, and temperature conditions (Table 1 , entries 1–18). As shown in Table 1, when 4-iodonitrobenzene (1 equiv) was stirred with BiPh3 (0.43 equiv) in presence of PdCl2(CH3CN)2, ligand 5 and different bases in heated DMF (90°C), the corresponding 4-nitrobiphenyl was obtained in 30–60% yields (Table 1, entries 1–6). The catalytic activity of 5 is highly dependent on bases. Among the several bases examined, the use of KOH, KOAc, K3PO4, Na3PO4 and Na2CO3 as the bases in DMF at 90°C gave 4-nitrobiphenyl in about 30–50% yields after 5h (Table 1, entries 1–5). It is noteworthy that the desired product was obtained in 60% yield using the base K2CO3 in DMF at 90°C (Table 1, entry 6). Encouragingly, this cross-coupling reaction was founded to be effective even at room temperature in 70% yield (Table 1, entry 7). Lower reaction temperature led to higher yield. This might be attributed to the reduction of by-products of biphenyl from BiPh3 and homo-coupled product from aryl iodide at room temperature. Therefore, the base K2CO3 was proven to be effective in DMF at room temperature. Among the solvents tested, the cross-coupling product was poor in THF, acetone and 1,4-dioxane (Table 1, entries 8–10). However, excellent yields were obtained when the solvent was changed to DMSO or NMP (Table 1, entries 11–12). Under the best conditions described in Table 1, the reaction afforded a 95% isolated yield of 4-nitrobiphenyl by employing 5mol% of ligand 5, 3mol% of PdCl2(CH3CN)2, 4 equiv K2CO3 in DMSO at room temperature for 24h (Table 1, entry 11). Using optimized conditions, the cross-coupling scope and generality of a variety of aryl iodides with different triarylbismuths was investigated in DMSO at room temperature (Table 2 ). The presence of an electron-withdrawing group of aryl iodide is tolerated. As shown in Table 2 (entries 1–11), electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl iodide gave higher yields of isolated pure compound at room temperature. Besides, electron-donating substituents on the triarylbismuths result in slightly lower yields. It has been suggested that the presence of an electron-donating group of triarylbismuths is favourable to increase side products of biaryl from triarylbismuths. Unfortunately, a substrate with an electron-donating group at the para-position of aryl iodide did not afford the corresponding biaryl in high yield because of the competitive and intercurrent homo-coupling of 4-iodoanisole (Table 2, entry 12, 72% yield). So, we commenced our studies by examining the effects of various reactions parameters on the yield of this cross-coupling using 4-iodoanisole and triphenylbismuth. After the Pd-NHC was shown to be an effective catalyst for the cross-coupling of aryl iodides and triarylbismuths, the ligand 6 was also prepared for comparison. This imidazolium salt 6 was then compared with NHC-benzo-crown ether ligand 5 in standard cross-coupling forming biaryls (Table 2, entries 1–9). It was worth noting that both precursors gave comparable reaction yields under optimized reaction conditions of cross-coupling aryl iodides and triarylbismuth. It is surprising that ligand 5 seems to have a large impact on the coupling (Table 2, entries 1–9). Palladium complexes with the supermolecular NHC ligands have been studied previously and shown to be efficient in Suzuki-Mayarua cross coupling reaction [23–25]. For example, Luo M. group reported palladium (II)-NHC Metallacrown Ether Complexes in 2009 [24]. We have prepared the NHC ligand based porphyrins and metallacrown ether scafford, and discussed the catalytic activity of Suzuki coupling [25]. The crownether-based imidazolium salt is promising for the constructions of highly active supramolecular catalytic systems. The model reaction was also tested under the reaction conditions used in the synthesis of 4-methoxylbiphenyl (5mol%) of ligand 5, 3mol% of PdCl2(CH3CN)2, 4 equiv K2CO3 and the results are summarized in Table 3 . In the current studies, we usually investigated the effect of solvent and reaction temperature on the model reaction. Among the solvents examined, DMSO was afforded moderate yield (72%), regardless of the reaction temperature (Table 3, entries 1, 5 and 10). NMP was found to be the best solvent, and the yields increase with the decrease of reaction temperature (Table 3, entries 3, 8 and 9). The nature of the initial precatlayst, solvent and base is crucial for the success of the cross-coupling reaction, especially. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl iodide gave higher yields of isolated pure compound in DMSO at room temperature. Besides, electron-donating substituents on the triarylbismuths result in slightly lower yields. It has been suggested that the presence of an electron-donating group of aryl iodides is favourable to increase side products of biaryl from aryl iodides in DMSO. We found that the substrate with an electron-donating group underwent the reaction smoothly to furnish the corresponding biaryl in higher yield and minimized side products in NMP at room temperature. Using NMP as solvent led to higher yield. This might be attributed to the reduction of by-products from homo-coupling of aryl iodide at room temperature. Therefore, the optimal catalytic system involved the use of ligand 5 (5 mol%), PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (3mol%), K2CO3 (4 equiv) in NMP at room temperature for 24h. The scope of this cross-coupling reaction of triarylbismuths and aryl iodides with electron-donating group was also established by different triarylbismuths and various aryl iodides (Table 4 ). Using the NHC-benzo-9-crown-3 ligand 5, PdCl2(CH3CN)2 as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, the cross-coupling reactions of aryl iodides and triarylbismuths were carried out in NMP at room temperature. The cross-coupling reactivity with aryl iodides with electron donating was found to be efficient even with a lower palladium catalyst (3mol%) loading (Table 4, entries 1–15) at room temperature. The reactions of electron-rich p-methyl, p-methoxy and p-amino substituted iodophenyl gave high yields of the cross-coupling products. In general, strong electron-donating substituents on the aryl iodide or triarylbismuths result in lower slightly yields. The Pd–NHC was show to be an effective catalyst for the cross-coupling of triarylbismuths and aryl iodides. Despite the lower reactivity of aryl chlorides and bromides compared with the corresponding aryl iodides. Aryl chlorides and bromides are the most desirable substrates because of their lower cost and ready availability. Here, we have performed the reaction of triarylbismuths with aryl bromides and chlorides in order to extend scope and define limitation of our strategy (Table 5 ). Unfortunately, in our system, the ligand 5 only demonstrated a low level of catalytic activity compared with aryl iodides at room temperature (entries 1 and 5), but showed higher activities in 90°C (entries 4 and 8). When 5mol% of PPh3/ligand 5 (1:1) were employed in cross-coupling reaction at room temperature, both aryl bromide and aryl chloride generated moderate to good yields of the corresponding biphenyl products (Table 5, entries 3 and 7). It was notably found that the presence of PPh3 was essential to keep the process efficient. The hypothesis of the reaction mechanism has been described in reference (Scheme 2 ) [17]. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed an efficient reaction of aryl iodides and triarylbismuths catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbene-PdCl2 based on benzo-9-crown-3 at room temperature. Aryl iodides bearing an electron-withdrawing or electron-donating group underwent the reaction smoothly to furnish the corresponding biaryl in high yields in NMP or DMSO by combined use of imidazolium salt 5 with K2CO3 as ligand and base, respectively. The transformation can tolerate either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing functional groups. When 5mol% of PPh3/ligand 5 (1:1) were employed in cross-coupling reaction at room temperature, both aryl bromide and aryl chloride generated moderate to good yields of the corresponding biphenyl products. This exploration is expected to have great applications in organic synthesis. 4.1 X-ray structure crystallography Crystals of 5 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown from layering a saturated CH3CN and chlorobenzene solution with diethyl ether. Suitable crystals of 5 were mounted on a glass fiber in a random orientation. The structures were solved by direct methods and all nonhydrogen atoms were subjected to anisotropic refinement by full-matrix least squares on F2 using the SHELXTL package. Data collection was performed at room temperature on a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD diffractometer operating at 50kV and 20mA using Mo-Ka radiation (0.71073Å). An empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program. All hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically (CH bond lengths fixed at 0.96Å), assigned appropriated isotropic thermal parameters and included in structure factor calculations.

        "dc:description": "We have developed the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand/PdCl2 catalyst for CC coupling reaction of aryl iodides and organobismuths at room temperature. The established catalytic system exhibited high cross-coupling reactivity between a variety of orgnobismuths and aryl iodides in the presence of K2CO3 as base in NMP or DMSO at room temperature. The simple and efficient transformation can tolerate either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating functional groups. It was notably found that both aryl bromide and aryl chloride generated moderate to good yields of the corresponding biphenyl products using 5mol% of PPh3/ligand 5 (1:1) as catalyst.",
