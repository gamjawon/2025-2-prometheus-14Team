Hybrid CP-MS41 architectures ordered by covalently bound ionic species were synthesized via a template-directed, self-assembling process of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) with 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane (ClPTES). The solvent extracted CP-MS41 was activated by the consecutive immobilization of imidazole followed by alkylation with an alkyl halide resulting in the immobilized imidazole substituent CP-MS 41 (RIm+X−-MS41) or immobilized ionic liquid (IIL). A wide variety of CP-MS41 and RIm+X−-MS41 were synthesized and characterized using XRD, BET, FT–IR, EA, SEM, CP 13C-, 29Si-MAS-NMR, and TG/DTG. EA and FT–IR confirmed adduct formation of ionic-liquids with the host system. The effects of temperature, catalyst amount, influence of alkyl chain length, and variation of CO2 pressure were examined. Keywords Carbon dioxide Cyclic carbonates IIL Eco-friendly process Hybrid MS41 1 Introduction The cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates is one of the few industrial processes that utilize CO2 as a raw material. Cyclic carbonates are widely used as electrolyte components in lithium batteries, aprotic polar solvents, chemical intermediates and monomers in the production of pharmaceutical and fine chemicals [1–4]. Although many phosgene-free processes for the synthesis of corresponding 5-membered cyclic carbonates have been reported [5–7], the reaction of epoxides with carbon dioxide has also attracted considerable attention. In the last decade of the 20th century, many catalytic systems [8–10] were developed for the insertion of carbon dioxide into an oxirane, such as alkali metal salts [11], alkali metal salts combined with crown ethers or quaternary ammonium salts [12], organoantimony halides [13], MgO [14] or Mg–Al mixed oxides [15], ionic liquids [16], porphyrin [17], transition-metal complexes [18], phthalocyanine [19], polyoxometalate [20], supercritical carbon dioxide [21], amorphous silica immobilized ionic liquid/ZnCl2 [22], amine-functionalized mesoporous Ti(Al)-SBA-15 [23], and as-made MCM-41 [24]. However, these catalysts suffer from low catalytic activity and/or selectivity, low stability, separation, and require high pressure and/or high temperatures. Hence, the development of a highly efficient solid catalyst system for the chemical fixation of carbon dioxide under mild conditions remains a challenge. Recently, a better synthesis approach has been reported for the preparation of hybrid inorganic–organic mesoporous materials based on the co-condensation of siloxane and organosiloxane precursors in the presence of a templating surfactant solution [25]. These materials are of particular interest on account of their regular, ordered architecture allowing high accessibility of the immobilized imidazolium units due to the ionically connected ionic liquid to the surface of supported materials through an appropriate linker. These IILs have both anionic and the cationic parts, which can be tuned for specific purposes. Such an anchoring mode tends to force the active sites towards the center of the pores, which imparts high chemical and thermal stability leading to high catalytic activity. This study examined the synthesis of IILs by a 2-step immobilization on CP-MS41. Improved ionization and uniform distribution of the IL over the CP-MS41 system for the effective utilization of CO2 is an expected outcome. In addition, these ionic liquids enable a phosgene-free system. These open type active sites containing a catalyst are very efficient in chemical fixation of carbon dioxide to form cyclic carbonate under conditions of higher pressure, high TON (turnover number) and TOF (turnover frequency), and in the absence of solvents. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of hybrid material, method of solvent extraction, and immobilization The molar ratio of the organically modified MCM-41 materials was determined from the various constituents in the synthesis mixture as follows: (1 + X) TEOS:(0.222 − X) ClPTES:0.29 C16TMABr:0.58 TMA-OH:81.67 H2O; where the (1+X)/(0.222−X) ratio ranged from 4.5–9.0, (1 + X) from 1.000–1.100, and (X) was 0.00 (4.5), 0.048 (6.0), 0.078 (7.5), 0.100 (9.0). Solution A: In a typical synthesis, TEOS [19.45 mL (4.5),20.36 mL (6.0),20.96 mL (7.5),and 21.39 mL (9.0)] was mixed with ClPTES [4.84 mL (4.5), 3.81 mL (6.0), 3.14 mL (7.5), and 2.66 mL (9.0)]. Solution A was added to Solution B, which consisted of 18.35g of TMA-OH and 18.0g of H2O. The mixture was stirred for 5min. The resulting solution is denoted as Solution C. Solution D contained 9.1g of CTMABr dissolved in a mixture of 30.0mL H2O and 45.0mL EtOH. Solution C was added into Solution D and the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 45min. The mixture was then heated in a water bath at 80°C for 45min to remove the alcohol added and produced from alkoxide hydrolysis. Finally, 54.0g H2O was added slowly to the solution during which the clear liquid turned into a turbid gel. The gel was aged overnight with continuous stirring for 20h (pH ∼12.1), and the pH of the resulting gel was adjusted to 11.3 with 4.0N HCl. The resulting solution was stirred for 4h, and the resulting gel heated in a Teflon-coated stainless steel autoclave at 140°C for 48h. The surfactant was extracted from 1.5g of the as-synthesized hybrid material with 210.0mL ethanol and 6.0mL 35% HCl at 65°C for 6h in first case. In the second case, 1.5g of the as-synthesized hybrid material was extracted with 210.0mL of ethanol and 20.0mL of 35% HCl at 65°C for 24h [26]. The resulting solid was then filtered, washed sequentially with 500.0mL ethanol and 2.0L of distilled water, and dried in air at 100°C. The same procedure was repeated to ensure maximum extraction. The immobilization experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere (99.99%) applying the following procedure. The CP-MS41 (4.5) was pre-activated at 200°C under vacuum (10−3 mbar) for 4h to remove physisorbed water. Five grams of mesoporous molecular sieves were immobilized with imidazole (5.0mmol/g) and dry benzene (10.0mL/g) refluxing at 90°C under a nitrogen atmosphere; alkyl halide (10.0mmol/g) was then added and the resulting mixture stirred for 12h. The excess imidazole and alkyl halide was removed by filtration followed by repeated washing with 2.0L dichloromethane (2.0L/5.0g of catalyst). The resulting solid was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. The IILs were prepared from the following: (1-Bromoethane) 1BE; (2-Bromopropane) 2BP; (1-Bromopropane) 1BP; and (1-Bromobutane) 1BB on CP-MS41 designated as: n-EImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-n-ethylimidazolium bromide-MS41); iso-PImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-iso-propylimidazolium bromide-MS41); n-PImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-n-propylimidazolium bromide-MS41); and n-BImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-n-butylimidazolium bromide-MS41). 2.2 Catalytic runs The synthesis of allyl glycidyl carbonate (AGC or 4-[(prop-2-en-1-yloxy)methyl]-1,3-dioxolan-2-one) from allyl glycidyl ether (AGE or 2-[(prop-2-en-1-yloxy)methyl]oxirane) and CO2 using RIm+X−-MS41s as carried out under a CO2 atmosphere at a pressure of 110 psig in a high pressure-reactor (55.0mL). The catalyst was introduced into the reactor containing 40.0mmol of AGE, with and without the solvent, with 0.5 or 1.0g of the catalyst (amount of the catalyst based on the amine content) in 110–360psig of CO2 at 80–140°C for 6h. A small portion of the reaction mixture was used to analyze the AGE concentration by gas chromatography (HP 6890 A) equipped with a HP-1 capillary column. The 5-membered cyclic carbonate was confirmed using a standard sample. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The powder XRD patterns of the solvent extracted materials in various TEOS to ClPTES ratios at pH 11.3, shows the hexagonal mesophase with the typical intense diffraction pattern of the (100) plane [27,28]. The presence of high angle peaks corresponding to (110), (200), and (210) planes confirms that the mesoporous materials possess a well-defined pore structure, which also confirms that the materials were unaffected by the acid treatment. Conversely, the crystallinity of the materials increased (I 100 from Table 1 ) with an increasing TEOS to ClPTES ratio. However, the I 100 peak increased drastically with increasing the TEOS to ClPTES ratio from 4.5 to 6.0. Therefore, a higher organosilane loading with a maximum intensity of CP-MS41 (6) is considered the optimum ratio for further immobilization studies. Table 1 shows the d100 spacing and lattice parameter (a 0) calculated according to earlier reports [29]. When comparing the used and fresh immobilized material with the host material (CP-MS41), the intensity was gradually affected upon every subsequent treatment. The Fig. 1 clearly shows that the host material has high I 100 and d 100 spacing values compared with the immobilized fresh n-EImBr-MS41 and used n-EImBr-MS41 catalyst. This shows that the immobilization process and reaction conditions (high pressure and long reaction time) significantly affected the material quality [30]. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the CP-MS41 (4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0) are type IV in nature, indicating the presence of mesopores [27,28]. The pore size distribution also shows a very narrow and strong band; a relatively small pore diameter (pore size distribution measured by the BJH method). Table 1 shows the surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the various organically modified MCM-41. The CP 13C-MAS-NMR of CP-MS41 (4.5) showed peaks at 50.2 (a’), 43.2 (b′), and 34.3 (c′) ppm corresponding to the carbon atoms of Cl–CH2 (a′), –CH2 (b′), and –CH2 (c′), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 [31]. The CP 13C-MAS-NMR of n-EImBr-MS41 (6.0) shows a variety of peaks in the range of 0–114ppm, with total carbons matching exactly the theoretical values. Immobilization of the imidazole on the host system was further confirmed from the appearance of aromatic imidazole peaks between 110–140ppm. The cis carbons of the imidazole moieties are observed at the adjacent peaks of 114 and 117ppm. Solid-state 29Si-MAS-NMR spectra of CP-MS41 (4.5) confirmed the presence of organo-functionalized moieties as a part of the silica wall structure for all the organically modified MCM-41 materials (Fig. 3 ). Distinct resonances can be clearly observed for the siloxane [Qn =Si(OSi)n(OH)4−n, n =2–4; Q3 at −104ppm; Q4 at −112ppm] and organosiloxane [Tm =RSi(OSi)m(OH)3−m, m =1–3; T3 at −77ppm; T2 at −74ppm] units [32], whereas, the post-grafting method shows T1 to be the only main peak compared with T2 and T3 [31]. Fig. 4 shows the FT–IR spectra of the parent and grafted materials. The bands at 2969 and 2937cm−1 were assigned to alkyl –C–H stretching, whereas the bands at 3116 and 3018cm−1 were assigned to aromatic –C–H stretching vibrations. Comparatively weak bands appearing at approximately 1721, 1480, and 1420cm−1 were assigned to –C–H bending vibrations, originating from the –CH2 groups present in the organic silane group. The presence of the imidazole in the host system can be further evidenced by confirming the presence of the –C–N stretch from the imidazolium units. The bands at 1215, 1045, and 769cm−1 [33] were attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the mesoporous framework (Si–O–Si). The effect of immobilization was demonstrated from EA, which apparently revealed the amount of imidazolium units present in the IILs (Table 2 ). The amount of RIm+X− units clearly showed that the effect of immobilization was irrespective of the imidazole. All the n-EImBr-MS41, iso-PImBr-MS41, n-PImBr-MS41, and n-BImBr-MS41 showed higher RIm+X− units, indicating that the small and flat type 5-membered cyclic imidazole immobilization was not interrupted due to common initial stage of the immobilization step. 3.2 Catalyst activity The RIm+X−-MS41 heterogeneous catalysts were tested for the chemical fixation of carbon dioxide in epoxide for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate, with AGE and carbon dioxide as the reactant. Scheme 1 shows the general mechanism for the formation of cyclic carbonate through an intermediate using a catalyst for the reaction between the oxirane–carbon dioxide system [11,17]. The cycloaddition reaction of oxirane was carried out in the presence of the IILs. From Table 3 , n-EImBr-MS41, iso-PImBr-MS41, n-PImBr-MS41, and n-BImBr-MS41 showed the AGE-conversion to be 98.9, 98.7, 99.1, and 99.3wt.%, respectively. The n-BImBr-MS41 showed the highest level of AGE-conversion. Xiao et al. [22] synthesized the IIL-hybrid amorphous silica and could achieve the maximum conversion only by the addition of zinc chloride with the immobilized materials. These microporous materials were unable to access the large size reactant. Therefore, such a reaction required the addition of an ionic salt; hence the reaction yielded the maximum outcome through the conversion of the catalyst again from a heterogeneous to homogenous system. However, the catalyst in the present study, RIm+X−-MS41, gave the highest outcome compared with the other heterogeneous immobilized ionic systems published thus far. In order to explain the advantage and importance of this study, the activity of the higher-ionic-system (RIm+X−-MS41) was compared with the lower-ionic-system (Hybrid Ti(Al)-SBA-15) developed by Srivastava et al. [23], which contained a functional organic and a Lewis acidic inorganic active system. These organic–inorganic active systems satisfy the requirements but the system remains complicated. The substituted, imidazole-immobilized CP-MS41 showed better activity, which might occur due to the high strength of the ionic character generated and well-separated by the imidazole group through aromaticity resulting in activity better than the organic–inorganic active system [23]. Table 3 reports the activity of the catalyst with the results of the pressure-influenced reaction in good agreement with a 2-phase reaction mechanism. The AGE-conversion increased with increasing pressure. When the CO2 pressure increased from 110 to 360psig, the level of AGE-conversion increased up to 300psig, but decreased with further increases in pressure. Although the higher length of the n-butane group present in the active center resulted in greater steric hindrance than other linear alkyl groups from alkyl halides (1-bromoethane and 1-bromopropane), the n-butane group can donate greater electron density (through +Inductive effect) than the other corresponding linear alkyl halides. These behaviors can be understood by the competitive nature between the inductive and steric effects on a system possessing restricted pores, MCM-41 and MCM-48. Therefore, the diffusion constraint of the lengthy n-butane was unavoidable, even though the increase in electron density overcome depends on the diffusion constant. While comparing the higher and lower activities of the RIm+X−-MS41s, the activity depends on the diffusion limitation of residual pores, steric effect, and inductive effect. In the case of n-BImBr-MS41, solid ions with lengthy n-butyl linker moieties in the channels may cause some diffusion limitation, whereas iso-PImBr-MS41 solid ions do not have large diffusion constants, as in the previous case, even though the linker isopropyl moieties will show some influence, through steric factors, over the approaching bulky reactant oxiranes. However, the results showed that the more steric isopropyl group yielded lower AGE-conversion. Conversely, there was a higher TON value than that of the material activated by the n-butyl group. Hence, the higher activity not only depends on steric and inductive effects, but also on the free space for the reactants to approach the active sites. This can be explained by the amount of imidazolium unit per gram in iso-PImBr-MS41 being significantly lower than the n-BImBr-MS41 (Table 2); the lower imidazole units may result in a material with a higher average-idle-adjust space. Such free space may support the approach and formation of the bulky intermediates for incoming reactant molecules without producing diffusion constraints. This may increase the diffusion-adsorption–desorption rates, thus showing a positive sign. This activity can be explained from the TON of AGE-yield in Table 3, which shows that the reaction falls into a typical heterogeneous reaction trend. While comparing the differences in CO2 pressure, the n-EImBr-MS41 catalyst shows a gradual increase in TON, up to 300psig, but a gradual decrease above the optimum pressure. This shows that the TON depends entirely on the availability of CO2. These results can be further confirmed by AGE-conversion, which also matches the TON results discussed above, whereas the TOF is significantly lower due to the longer reaction time. The second catalytic cycle was run to examine the stability of catalytic activity and recycling. In each cycle, the catalyst was separated by filtration and used directly for the next run. Control experiments were performed to examine the extent of leaching, which could also account for activity loss. Reaction conversion was either unaffected or insignificantly affected by the lack of leaching phenomenon in the consecutive cycles (n-EImBr-MS41 showed 98.4% AGE-conversion with 89.3% AGC-selectivity at 240psig after 6h at 110°C of reaction time of the second cycle). Therefore, the formation of ionic bonds on the IILs and the porous system was unaffected by the reaction conditions. 4 Conclusions RIm+X−-MS41 materials were generated with a larger number of active sites, more uniform pores, higher surface area with long-range order, and better-distributed functionality than the materials produced using the post-grafting technique. Moreover, these materials are reusable without affecting long-range order. The activity of these solid ions was not influenced significantly by high pressure, high temperature, or higher amounts of catalyst due to the presence of a larger number of active sites in the host system.
