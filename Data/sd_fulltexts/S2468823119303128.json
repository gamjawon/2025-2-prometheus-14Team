Graphical abstract Various metal oxides (MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2) were treated with NH3 for incorporating nitrogen into the structure of metal oxides. The pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides were used as solid base catalysts for isomerization of glucose to f7ructose in water. SiO2 and Nb2O5 showed a large increment of nitrogen content by the treatment with NH3. FT-IR study on NH3-treated SiO2 revealed that NH3 reacted with terminal silanol groups and siloxane bonds to form Si-NH2 and Si-NH-Si groups. Meanwhile, nitrogen was incorporated into bulk crystal of Nb2O5, causing amorphization of the crystal. Of all the samples, pristine and NH3-treated MgO showed highest catalytic activity for the isomerization of glucose. However, the selectivity to fructose was low due to subsequent reactions of formed fructose. Catalytic activity of Al2O3 and SiO2 was increased by the treatment with NH3, while that of the other metal oxides was not affected. Particularly, the catalytic activity of SiO2 emerged after the treatment with NH3 and was enhanced by increasing the temperature for the treatment up to 800 °C. While fructose was consumed by subsequent reactions over MgO, decreasing the selectivity, such reactions of fructose were not noticeable over NH3-treated SiO2. Consequently, NH3-treated SiO2 showed higher selectivity to fructose and gave higher carbon balance than MgO. Keywords Fructose Glucose Isomerization Knoevenagel condensation Oxynitride Solid base 1 Introduction Biomass is expected to be a carbon source for production of chemicals in the future. Since cellulose is the major component in lignocellulosic plant biomass, glucose is an important intermediate material for the production of chemicals from biomass. With a view to manufacturing useful chemicals from biomass, fructose is considered to be more preferable than glucose. For instance, the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is a potential precursor for bio-based furanics, has been achieved in acceptable yield from fructose, though the production of HMF from glucose is much more difficult and still a challenging issue [1–5]. Thus, isomerization of glucose to fructose is a primary reaction to utilize biomass as a feedstock for chemicals [6,7]. The first example of a chemocatalyst for the isomerization of saccharides was base catalysts found by Lobry de Bruyn and van Ekenstein in 19th century. Since their pioneering research, classically, various types of homogeneous base catalysts were investigated as catalysts [8,9]. However, with concern over the problems arising from the use of homogenous base catalysts, research attention has been paid to heterogeneous base catalysts. So far, diverse materials such as single metal oxides [10–13], hydrotalcite [14–18], zeotype materials [18–21], metallosilicate [22], polymer-based materials [23,24] and supported amine (imine) [25,26] have been studied as solid base catalysts. From the viewpoint of availability, handling, and cost, basic single metal oxides such as MgO and ZrO2 have been expected to be promising candidates as catalysts for the isomerization of glucose to fructose. However, the use of these metal oxides resulted in low selectivity to fructose and occasionally significant loss of carbon balance [11,13,17]. Hence, modification of such metal oxides is absolutely indispensable to improve the selectivity to fructose. Treatment of metal oxides with NH3 at high temperature is a well-known method to incorporate nitrogen into metal oxides and modify their properties. Many examples of the treatment are found in silicon-based materials such as amorphous silica [27,28], mesoporous silica [29,30], and aluminosilicates including zeolites [30–33]. Due to the incorporation of nitrogen onto their surface by the treatment, these materials gained base properties and were usable as solid base catalysts [27–32]. However, to our knowledge, there has never been a report on application of such NH3-treated metal oxides as solid base catalysts for the isomerization of saccharides. In the present study, catalytic properties of various pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides were investigated in the isomerization of glucose to fructose. We found that NH3-treated SiO2 with preferable base properties promoted the isomerization of glucose selectively. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Benzaldehyde (98%), 1,4-dioxane (99.5%), ethyl cyanoacetate (98%), fructose (99%), glucose (98%), octane (98%), and toluene (99.5%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical. He (99.99%) and NH3 (99.9%) were purchased from Air Water Inc. TiO2 (STR-100 N) was purchased from Sakai Chemical Industry. ZrO2 (RC-100), and CeO2 (type A) were purchased from Daiichi Kigenso Kagakukogyo. Al2O3 (AEROXIDE Alu C) and SiO2 (Aerosil 300) were kindly given by Nippon Aerosil. MgO (500A) and Nb2O5 hydrate made by UBE Material Industries and CBMM, respectively, were obtained through the Japan Reference Catalyst Project, Catalysis Society of Japan. 2.2 Treatment of metal oxides with NH3 MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2 were tested as catalysts for isomerization of saccharides. Prior to the use, all the powdery metal oxides were calcined in air at 500 °C for 5 h using a muffle furnace. The calcined metal oxides were pressed, crushed and sieved into 500–710 μm in size. The sieved sample was placed in the middle of a quartz tube and sandwiched with quartz wool at both sides. By using a horizontal tubular electric furnace, the sample was treated in NH3 flow (20 mL/min for 1 g of metal oxide) at 500 °C for 5 h and then purged with He flow at the same flow rate at 500 °C for 0.5 h. After cooled down to ambient temperature in He flow, the sample was taken out and ground. The powdery sample was used for characterization and catalytic reactions. The samples treated with NH3 are denoted with -N at the end of the name of the metal oxides, e.g., MgO-N. The treatment with NH3 was conducted at 600, 700, and 800 °C in the same manner as that at 500 °C. These samples are denoted with the temperature at the end of the name, e.g., SiO2-N800. 2.3 Characterization Powder XRD patterns were collected using Cu Kα radiation (30 kV, 15 mA) on a Rigaku MiniFlex diffractometer. Nitrogen content of the samples was determined by CHN analysis using a vario MICRO cube elemental analyzer (elementar). N2 adsorption isotherms were measured using a BEL-mini analyzer (MicrotracBEL) at −196 °C. Prior to the measurements, powder samples were pretreated in N2 flow at 300 °C for 1 h. Specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Base properties of the samples were examined by temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) using a BEL-TPD analyzer (MicrotracBEL) equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer M-QA100 F (ANELVA). A powder sample (50 mg) was pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h in He flow (20 mL/min). After cooled down to 50 °C in He flow, the sample was exposed to CO2 (27 kPa) for 10 min. The sample was purged with He flow (20 mL/min) at the same temperature for 0.5 h to remove weakly adsorbed CO2. A TPD profile was obtained by increasing the temperature of the sample from 50 to 500 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min in He flow (20 mL/min) and concentration of CO2 (m/z = 44) in the effluent gas was monitored by the quadrupole mass spectrometer. FT-IR spectra were measured on JASCO FTIR-4600. A powder sample (50 mg) was pelletized to a self-supporting disk and set in a quartz cell connected to a vacuum line. The sample was heated to 400 °C and kept for 1 h in vacuo as a pretreatment. A spectrum was recorded at ambient temperature. 2.4 Isomerization of glucose Catalytic performance of pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides was evaluated in isomerization of glucose to fructose in water (Scheme 1 ). A powder catalyst (50 mg) was added to 5 mL of aqueous solution of glucose (50 mM) in a test tube. The suspension was heated at 80 °C using an aluminum block heater. After a pre-set time, the reaction was quenched by cooling the test tube in an ice bath. The solid sample was removed with a membrane filter and the resulting filtrate was analyzed on an HPLC using an LC-20A (SHIMADZU) equipped with an ion-exclusion column (ROA-Organic Acid, Phenomenex). Glucose and products in the filtrate solution were detected with a refractive index detector and their amount was calculated according to the calibration curves with 1,4-dioxane as an internal standard. To identify by-products, the filtrate was analyzed on a GC–MS (SHIMADZU GCMS-QP2010SE) equipped with a capillary column (SHIMADZU SH-Rxi-5Sil MS). In order to analyze non-volatile compounds such as glucose and fructose, trimethylsilylation was conducted. An aqueous solution of the fitrate (1 mL) was exposed to N2 flow and evaporated to dryness. Then, 2 mL of pyridine was added as a solvent and 0.25 mL of 1-tirmethylsilylimidazole was added and kept static for 0.5 h. The obtained pyridine solution was analyzed on the GC–MS and products were identified with reference to a database. 2.5 Knoevenagel condensation Catalytic performance of the pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides was also evaluated in Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate to ethyl cyanocinnamate (Scheme 2 ). A powdery sample was added to the toluene solution of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate in a test tube and the suspension was heated at 70 °C for 2 h using an aluminum block heater. The solid samples were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was analyzed by GC-FID equipped with a ZB-1 column (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.5 μm, Phenomenex). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Composition and structure Nitrogen content determined by CHN analysis is shown in Table 1 . All the pristine metal oxides contained only a small amount of nitrogen below 20 μmol/g. The treatment of MgO, TiO2, and ZrO2 with NH3 resulted in only a small increment of the nitrogen content and the obtained samples had the nitrogen content less than 100 μmol/g. For Al2O3 and CeO2, the nitrogen content was moderately increased to 130 and 230 μmol/g, respectively. A large increment of nitrogen was observed on Nb2O5-N, probably due to incorporation of nitrogen inside bulk crystal, which is explained later. When SiO2 was treated at 500 °C, a moderate increment of nitrogen was found (210 μmol/g for SiO2-N500). By increasing the temperature for the treatment, the nitrogen content was drastically increased up to 1140 μmol/g for SiO2-N800. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides. MgO and MgO-N showed diffraction patterns of the rock salt-type cubic structure, indicating that no significant change of the structure in the bulk occurred during the treatment with NH3. However, the intensities of diffraction lines became higher after the treatment because of crystallite growth, which was consistent with a small decrease in specific surface area (Table 1). Al2O3 and Al2O3-N showed diffraction patterns typical to γ-Al2O3. SiO2 showed only a halo peak around 20°, reflecting its amorphous structure. Even after the treatment at 800 °C, SiO2-N800 retained the amorphous structure. TiO2, ZrO2, and CeO2 had rutile, tetragonal, and cubic structures, respectively, and their structures were retained after the treatment with NH3. Nb2O5 showed a diffraction pattern assigned to orthorhombic structure. After the treatment with NH3, similar diffraction lines were observed in lower intensity on undulated baseline, implying amorphization of the crystalline structure during the treatment. Considering that Nb2O5-N had a high nitrogen content, it is presumed that Nb2O5 was highly reactive for NH3 under the treatment conditions and that incorporation of a large amount of nitrogen inside the crystal induced the amorphization. Base properties of the pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides were examined by CO2-TPD (Figure S1). MgO showed a broad desorption of CO2 from 100 to 300 °C and the number of base sites was 40 μmol/g, which did not change significantly after the treatment with NH3 (Table 1). ZrO2 and ZrO2-N had a small number of base sites at ˜20 μmol/g. CeO2 and CeO2-N showed similar desorption peaks at ˜100 °C, but the number of base sites was slightly decreased by the treatment with NH3. This is probably because a part of oxygen that originally formed base sites was consumed by the reaction with NH3 and the resulting nitrogen sites did not adsorb CO2. The other pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides adsorbed only a negligible amount of CO2, independent of their nitrogen content. MgO, ZrO2, and CeO2 are known as basic metal oxides and in fact, each of these materials adsorbed a considerable amount of CO2. For these metal oxides, oxygen atoms with low coordination numbers can act as base sites that adsorb CO2 [34]. Meanwhile, for all the metal oxides, nitrogen atoms incorporated onto them had only weak affinity for CO2 [35,36]. As a result, the increment of base sites by the treatment with NH3 was negligible. 3.2 Isomerization of glucose to fructose Catalytic properties of the pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides were evaluated in the isomerization of glucose to fructose (Table 2 ). The isomerization hardly proceeded without a catalyst (Blank in Table 2). MgO showed high catalytic activity and achieved 52.2% conversion of glucose. However, selectivity to fructose was only 65.8% and yield of fructose was 34.4%. Following MgO, ZrO2 showed high activity for the isomerization, giving 9.7% yield of fructose at 14.1% conversion of glucose. TiO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2 showed poor catalytic activity and gave low yield of fructose less than 3%. Al2O3 and SiO2 g were basically inactive for the isomerization. MgO-N also showed high activity similar to that of MgO, but the selectivity to fructose was further decreased to 55.5%. In addition, the recovery of saccharides, which corresponds to the total amount of glucose and fructose after the reaction, was only 82.2% and 73.9% for MgO and MgO-N, respectively, indicating that unselective conversion of glucose occurred over these catalysts. The treatment with NH3 was not effective for TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2 and their catalytic performance was altered only slightly by the treatment. Catalytic activity of SiO2 emerged after the treatment with NH3. SiO2-N500 gave 11.4% yield of fructose at 12.1% conversion of glucose. The activity was further increased by the treatment at 600 °C; SiO2-N600 gave 20.2% yield of fructose. Further increase in the temperature led to a slight increase in the activity and eventually, SiO2-N800 gave 22.8% yield of fructose. It is noteworthy that NH3-treated SiO2 catalysts showed high selectivity to fructose over 90% and that the saccharides recovery was nearly 100%, which was quite different to MgO-based ones. While Al2O3 was inactive for the isomerization of glucose, Al2O3-N promoted the reaction and gave 7.2% yield of fructose. These results demonstrated that the treatment with NH3 was effective for SiO2 and Al2O3 to enhance their activity and that the isomerization occurred over nitrogen incorporated onto these materials. 3.3 Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate We applied Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate to ethyl cyanocinnamate as a typical base-catalyzed reaction for evaluating catalytic properties of the pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides (Fig. 2 ). Only MgO showed catalytic activity for the reaction among the pristine metal oxides. For almost all the metal oxides except for Nb2O5, the catalytic activity appeared obviously after the treatment with NH3. Especially, NH3-treated SiO2 samples showed high catalytic activity due to the plenty of nitrogen incorporated on them. SiO2-N500 gave 11% yield of ethyl cyanocinnamate and SiO2-N600 showed higher activity, achieving 46% yield. SiO2-N700 and -N800 samples gave slightly higher yield than SiO2-N600. This trend in the catalytic activity for the Knoevenagel condensation was similar to that observed in the isomerization of glucose. Presumably, these two reactions are promoted by the same active nitrogen sites. Al2O3-N and ZrO2-N, which had similar nitrogen content, showed similar moderate catalytic activity and gave ˜9% yield of the product. Although having the relatively large nitrogen content, CeO2-N gave only 5% yield of the product. TiO2-N having a small nitrogen content gave 7% yield of the product. In spite of the large nitrogen content, Nb2O5-N was inactive for the Knoevenagel condensation nor the isomerization of glucose. Since nitrogen was incorporated into the bulk crystal of Nb2O5, as observed in the amorphization by XRD, such nitrogen did not contribute to the catalysis on the surface of the crystal. 3.4 Formation of active nitrogen base sites on SiO2 The treatment with NH3 was effective to enhance the catalytic activity of particular metal oxides such as SiO2 for both isomerization of glucose and Knoevenagel condensation. Meanwhile, TiO2 and CeO2 showed poor catalytic activity after the treatment with NH3. The catalytic activity of NH3-treated metal oxides was presumably related to the structure of surface nitrogen species. Hence, choosing SiO2 and CeO2 as representative samples, the structure of nitrogen was examined by measuring IR spectra of the pristine and NH3-treated samples (Fig. 3 A). In a spectrum of SiO2, a sharp absorption band for OH stretching vibration of terminal silanol appeared at ˜3740 cm−1 on a broad band for hydrogen-bonded silanol groups at 3500 – 3800 cm−1. For NH3-treated SiO2 samples, the intensity of the band for terminal silanol was decreased, but absorption bands of NH stretching vibration were newly observed at 3350 – 3450 cm−1 [37,38]. Obviously, terminal silanol reacted with NH3 to form surface NH x groups. In contrast, such absorption bands for OH and NH stretching vibrations were hardly observed for CeO2 nor CeO2-N. Since CeO2 had only a small amount of terminal hydroxyl groups, CeO2-N had only a limited amount of surface NH x groups if terminal hydroxyl groups reacted with NH3 and consequently showed the poor catalytic activity. The changes of functional groups on SiO2 were clearly observed in difference IR spectra (Fig. 3B). After the treatment with NH3 at 500 °C, the absorption band for terminal silanol at 3736 cm−1 was slightly decreased, but a broad band for hydrogen-bonded silanol at 3600 – 3700 cm−1 was increased. Additionally, an absorption band for Si-NH2 appeared at 3417 cm−1. By the treatment at 600 °C, the absorption band for Si-NH2 was increased. Upon increasing the temperature to 700 and 800 °C, absorption bands for Si-NH-Si were observed at 3377 and 3437 cm−1 in high intensities. At 600 °C or higher, terminal and hydrogen-bonded silanols were decreased and finally at 800 °C, hydrogen-bonded silanol was largely decreased, compared to SiO2. Based on the above observation, a plausible scheme for the formation of NH x groups on SiO2 is described in Scheme 3 . Below 600 °C, NH3 reacted with terminal silanol to form Si-NH2, releasing H2O. In addition, NH3 cleaved Si-O-Si bond to form Si-NH2 and silanol. At further elevated temperatures, condensation of surface functional groups dominantly occurred to form Si-NH-Si and regenerate Si-O-Si bonds. Catalytic activity of SiO2 was significantly enhanced by the treatment with NH3 at 500 °C and increased more by the treatment at 600 °C. However, further increase in the temperature to 700 and 800 °C resulted in only a small increase in the activity. This trend well agrees with the change in the intensity of the absorption band for Si-NH2 at 3417 cm−1, indicating that a catalytically active nitrogen site is Si-NH2 rather than Si-NH-Si. 3.5 Difference in catalytic performance between SiO2-N800 and MgO The catalytic performance of SiO2-N800 was compared with that of MgO in detail in the time course of the isomerization of glucose (Fig. 4 ). In the presence of SiO2-N800, the conversion of glucose reached plateau at ˜40%. Since the isomerization of glucose to fructose is a reversible reaction and glucose is thermodynamically favorable under the reaction conditions, the conversion of glucose seemed to level off in long-term reactions unless side reactions proceeded. In contrast, the conversion of glucose constantly increased as time went by in the presence of MgO. The selectivity to fructose was decreased as the conversion was increased, suggesting that fructose was consumed by subsequent reactions. Since such subsequent reactions consumed a part of formed fructose and consequently, the reaction did not reach the chemical equilibrium between glucose and fructose, the conversion of glucose constantly increased. Therefore, SiO2-N800 was found to be more suitable than MgO as a catalyst for the isomerization of glucose in terms of selectivity to fructose. Catalytic performance was further compared between SiO2-N800 and MgO for isomerization reaction using fructose as a reactant instead of glucose (Fig. 5 ). Since fructose is generally more reactive than glucose, the catalyst dosage for the isomerization of fructose was only a half of that for glucose. For SiO2-N800, the conversion of fructose was slightly higher than the yield of glucose at any reaction time, implying the high selectivity to glucose (Fig. 5a). In the presence of MgO, while fructose was rapidly consumed and the conversion of fructose reached 50% within 1 h, the maximum yield of glucose was below 20% (Fig. 5b). Although several by-products such as dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde were identified by analysis on a GC–MS (Figure S2), total yield of them did not possibly account for the difference between the conversion of fructose and the yield of glucose for the reaction with MgO. Colorless solution of fructose colored in the course of reaction in the presence of MgO. After 5 h, the solution became dark brown due to the formation of colored by-products. Formation of such colored by-products was the main cause of the low selectivity to glucose. Similar phenomena was also observed in the isomerization of glucose to fructose. In the isomerization of glucose, the rapid subsequent reactions of fructose would lead to the low selectivity to fructose. Table 3 summarizes reaction results on the isomerization of glucose and fructose over SiO2-N800 and MgO. For both saccharides, MgO gave higher conversion and higher yield of the desired product. However, in the cases using MgO, the saccharides recovery was low, especially in the isomerization of fructose due to the unselective reactions of fructose. Comparing the reactivity, fructose was much more reactive than glucose over MgO, while both saccharides showed similar reactivity over SiO2-N800. The high reactivity of fructose over MgO could make it impossible to produce fructose selectively through the isomerization of glucose. There was no clear correlation between the number of base sites determined by CO2-TPD and the catalytic activity for the isomerization nor Knoevenagel condensation. Contrary to MgO, ZrO2, and CeO2, which adsorbed a large amount of CO2, NH3-treated metal oxides including SiO2-based samples hardly adsorbed CO2, though they showed catalytic activity for Knoevenagel condensation. Additionally, while MgO promoted the reaction of fructose more than that of glucose, SiO2-N800 promoted the reactions of both saccharides almost equally. These results suggest different base properties between oxygen sites on MgO and nitrogen sites on SiO2-N800. 3.6 Reaction mechanism for isomerization of saccharides over SiO2-N800 In order to demonstrate that SiO2-N800 can act as a base catalyst for the isomerization of glucose, sulfuric acid was added into the solution for the isomerization of glucose with SiO2-N800. The presence of sulfuric acid strongly inhibited the isomerization of glucose, because the homogeneous acid strongly coordinated to base sites on SiO2-N800 and inhibited reaction with glucose. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate that SiO2-N800 worked as a heterogeneous catalyst for the isomerization of glucose, a hot filtration test was done (Fig. 6 ). The yield of fructose was 9.5% at 1 h with SiO2-N800. Then, the solid catalyst was removed by filtration and the reaction was proceed again for further 2 h. The yield of fructose was slightly increased to 11.4% by homogeneous catalysis. However, SiO2-N800 gave much higher yield of fructose (22.8%) at 3 h, demonstrating that the isomerization of glucose was promoted predominantly by heterogeneous catalysis of SiO2-N800. These results surely confirmed that SiO2-N800 can promote the isomerization of saccharides in water as a solid base catalyst. Two types of reaction mechanism have been known for the catalytic isomerization of glucose to fructose; one is a hydride transfer mechanism promoted by Lewis acid catalysts such as metal chlorides [39] and Lewis-acidic zeolites [40–42]. The other is proton abstraction mechanism in which base catalysts abstract proton at C-2 of glucose to form the enediol intermediate and the following keto-enol tautomerization produces fructose [43]. It is well known that Knoevenagel condensation proceeds via abstraction of proton from active methylene compounds such as ethyl cyanoacetate. Based on the good correlation between the activity for the isomerization of glucose and that for Knoevenagel condensation, SiO2-N800 as a base catalyst promoted the isomerization of glucose through the proton abstraction mechanism (Scheme 4 ). 3.7 Reusability of SiO2-N800 In order to check the stability and reusability, the spent SiO2-N800 was recovered and used multiple times (Figure S3). After each reaction run, the solid catalyst was recovered by filtration, dried overnight at 60 °C, and reused in the next run. The yield of fructose was gradually decreased and eventually, for the fourth run, the yield of fructose was 7.4%. The nitrogen content of SiO2-N800 was decreased from 1140 μmol/g to 500 μmol/g after the fourth run. The leaching of nitrogen during each reaction led to the decline in the catalytic activity. Future work needs to improve the stability of ammonia-treated metal oxides. 4 Conclusions NH3-treated SiO2 was found to deserve as a promising solid base catalyst for the isomerization of glucose to fructose in water. SiO2-N800 with the largest nitrogen content gave ˜40% yield of fructose in ˜90% selectivity, suppressing side reactions that lowered the selectivity to fructose. Si-NH2 was mainly formed by the treatment of SiO2 with NH3 at 500–600 °C and catalytic activity of SiO2 was remarkably enhanced by the treatment with NH3. However, further increase in the temperature resulted in the formation of Si-NH-Si, leading to only a small increase in the activity. Si-NH2 group was presumed to be a catalytically active nitrogen site on SiO2. Unlike MgO, subsequent reactions of fructose was not considerable over NH3-treated SiO2, being more suitable than MgO as a catalyst for the isomerization of glucose in terms of selectivity to fructose.

        "dc:description": "Various metal oxides (MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2) were treated with NH3 for incorporating nitrogen into the structure of metal oxides. The pristine and NH3-treated metal oxides were used as solid base catalysts for isomerization of glucose to f7ructose in water. SiO2 and Nb2O5 showed a large increment of nitrogen content by the treatment with NH3. FT-IR study on NH3-treated SiO2 revealed that NH3 reacted with terminal silanol groups and siloxane bonds to form Si-NH2 and Si-NH-Si groups. Meanwhile, nitrogen was incorporated into bulk crystal of Nb2O5, causing amorphization of the crystal. Of all the samples, pristine and NH3-treated MgO showed highest catalytic activity for the isomerization of glucose. However, the selectivity to fructose was low due to subsequent reactions of formed fructose. Catalytic activity of Al2O3 and SiO2 was increased by the treatment with NH3, while that of the other metal oxides was not affected. Particularly, the catalytic activity of SiO2 emerged after the treatment with NH3 and was enhanced by increasing the temperature for the treatment up to 800 °C. While fructose was consumed by subsequent reactions over MgO, decreasing the selectivity, such reactions of fructose were not noticeable over NH3-treated SiO2. Consequently, NH3-treated SiO2 showed higher selectivity to fructose and gave higher carbon balance than MgO.",
