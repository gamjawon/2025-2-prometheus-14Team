Graphical abstract Hydrogen generation by catalytic hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is studied by using Co–B-based thin film catalyst synthesized by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Co–B nanoparticles, produced in the catalyst film after the laser ablation process, act as active centers producing significantly higher H2 generation rate than Co–B bulk powder. Films were deposited at different PLD set-up parameters in order to estimate the density of the nanoparticles and to understand the role of their size in the catalytic process. Cobalt has been found here to act as an efficient catalyst only when alloyed with boron which partially prevents cobalt oxidation. In particular we report that when used as suitable thin films, Co–B produces H2 with a maximum generation rate of about 3300ml/[ming catalyst].

Keywords Hydrogen generation Catalyst Sodium borohydride Nanoparticles Cobalt boride 1 Introduction Hydrogen is very important as future energy vector whose application areas range from the vehicular transport to energy batteries. Pure hydrogen is adopted as the fuel in proton exchange membrane fuel cell PEMFC [1]. However, on industrial level, H2 is mostly produced by steam reforming of natural gas which, however, contains carbon contamination (CO2 and CO). The presence of carbon monoxide (even at ppm level) in the hydrogen gas reduces the performance of PEMFC by catalyst poisoning [2]. Therefore, especially for the mobile application, a fast and clean hydrogen supply method is required. Chemical hydrides are very attractive materials for hydrogen supply to the fuel cells at room temperature. Large amount of pure hydrogen gas is released during the hydrolysis of chemical hydrides in presence of certain catalysts. Alkaline sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is one of the most preferred hydride because of: (i) the high hydrogen storage capacity (10.9wt.%); (ii) the good chemical stability of its alkaline solutions; (iii) the optimal control on H2 generation rate by supported catalysts; (iv) the acceptable reaction rate even at low temperature; (v) the reaction product, borax, is environmentally clean and can be recycled [3]. In fact, NaBH4 can be regenerated by using mechano-chemical reduction of borax with MgH2 [4]. Catalysts like Ru supported on anion-exchange resin [3], fluorinated Mg-based alloy [5], Pt [6] and Pd supported on carbon [7], PtRu supported on metal oxide [8], raney Ni and Co, and even nickel and cobalt borides [9], are generally used to accelerate the hydrolysis reaction of the NaBH4. Catalysts based on Co–B seem to be interesting materials due to their low cost [10] and their high catalytic activity on hydrolysis reaction. Generally, all the previous catalysts were used in form of homogeneous powder which has some issues to be still solved, like: (1) separation of the catalyst from the suspension after the reaction is difficult; (2) the suspended particles tend to aggregate, especially when they are present at high concentrations; (3) particulate suspensions are not easily applicable to continuous flow systems. Catalyst in form of thin films, which has an extra degree of freedom to change the surface morphology and structure, can be easily recovered and reused and can work as on/off switch for generation of H2. For all these reasons, catalysts in form of thin films are used to solve the problems with the powder [11]. Catalytic activity is mainly a surface effect and forming nano-catalysts is a potential route to increase the surface area. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has emerged as viable method for the production of nanoparticles on surface of the thin films [12]. By changing the deposition parameter in PLD can lead to tune the surface of the film. In the present study, we used inexpensive and efficient cobalt boride catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4. Catalyst was synthesized in form of powder and thin film by using chemical reduction method and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), respectively. Catalyst thin film gives rise to high H2 generation rate as compared to the bulk powder: this is attributed to the prevailing surface morphology effects. The role of boron as partially protective agent against cobalt oxidation in the cobalt boride catalyst is also been studied and discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Co–B catalyst for the H2 generation was prepared by using NaBH4 as reducing agent of aqueous solution of Co(II) salts. The black powder separating from solution during reaction course was filtered, extensively washed with distilled water and ethanol, and vacuum dried at room temperature. In order to be used as a target for the film deposition, the Co–B powder was cold pressed in form of cylindrical disks. PLD was performed using KrF excimer laser (Lambda Physik) at the operating wavelength of 248nm, pulse duration of 25ns, and repetition rate of 20Hz. Details of the deposition apparatus are reported in Ref. [13]. Films were deposited on silicon substrates for the characterization and on glass substrates for checking their catalytic activity. For ablation in vacuum, laser fluence was varied from 1 to 10J/cm2. Deposition was also carried out under different Ar gas pressure in chamber by using laser fluence of 10J/cm2. Ar gas was introduced in the chamber through mass flow controller and pumping was throttled in order to maintain desired gas pressure. The target to sample distance was maintained at 4cm. Weight of the catalyst films was evaluated by measuring the weight of the glass slab (76mm×46mm), before and after deposition, and it was kept approximately constant (∼3mg) for all laser fluences by varying the number of laser pulses during deposition. Pure cobalt powder (99.9%) was cold pressed in form of cylindrical disk to obtain Co film using same laser parameters as used for Co–B compound. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface morphology of the Co–B catalyst was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) and particle size distribution was measured through the SEM images using an analysis 3.2 (SIS) software. The amorphous structure of both the catalyst powder and film was determined by convectional X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5414Å) in Bragg–Brentano (θ–2θ) configuration. Bruker (Equinox 55) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to identify the eventual presence of chemical species with BO bonds in the films. The composition of the film was studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS spectra were collected using a VG ESCALAB 210 (VG Scientific, UK) spectrometer equipped with a Mg Kα1,2 exciting source. The operative mode of the multi-channel electron analyzer was set at 50eV for wide acquisitions and at 20eV for detailed scans of: Co 2p, B 1s, Cl 2p, O 1s and C 1s. The calibration of peak positions was made using the Ag 3d5/2 (368.266±0.05eV) line of a standard silver foil, in situ sputtered with argon ions in order to remove the surface oxide and, finally, acquiring a clean spectrum. The energy resolution was of 0.9eV on the same line. The electrostatic charge correction was made on contamination C 1s peak position at 285eV for all narrow scan spectra. The elaborations were performed using the commercial software “CasaXPS” v.2.2 and the graphs were built up by Origin5.0 program and SLG(30) (Sum Lorentzian Gaussian) peak shape functions for all the components. Average surface roughness (R a) measurements were performed using Dektak IIA surface profilometer. 2.3 Activity measurement For catalytic activity measurements, an alkaline-stabilized solution (pH 13 (0.026±0.001M)) of sodium borohydride, (Rohm and Haas), was prepared by addition of NaOH. The titre of reagent was independently measured through iodometric method [14]. Gas volumetric method was used to measure the hydrogen generation in an appropriate reaction chamber with thermostatic bath, to keep the temperature constant within accuracy ±0.1°C. The chamber was equipped with pressure sensor, stirrer system, catalyst insertion device and also coupled with an electronic precision balance to accurately measure the weight of water volumes displaced by the hydrogen volumes produced during the reaction course. In all the runs, catalyst (in form of film or powder) was placed on the appropriate device inside the reaction chamber and the system was sealed. For comparison the plot of the time dependences versus stoichiometric hydrogen production yield (%) instead of versus amount hydrogen (ml) is reported. Co–B catalyst, both in forms of powder or as PLD-generated thin film, was added to 200ml of the above solution, at 298K under continuous stirring. Catalyst film is compared with the powder by using analogous amount of catalyst (∼3mg). Thus, in our tests the molar ratio between hydride and catalyst is about 10. 3 Results and discussion Films were deposited using three different laser fluences (1, 5, 10J/cm2). The surface morphologies of the deposited films, as obtained by SEM, are reported in Fig. 1 . As laser fluence increases from 1 to 10J/cm2 the average particle size increases from about 180 to 300nm and the number of particles also increases (Fig. 2 ). Reason behind this increase can be explained by phase explosion process, in which at higher laser fluence the target material under the target surface reaches a temperature of ∼0.9T c (thermodynamic critical temperature) causing a very high homogeneous nucleation of vapor bubble. The target then makes a rapid transition from superheated liquid to a matrix of vapor and liquid droplets, which leave the irradiated target surface and are deposited on the substrate [15]. Similar laser deposition parameters are used to produce pure Co film and indeed we observe in SEM image (Fig. 3 ) similar morphology as for Co–B compound films. Another set of films was deposited by using two different Ar pressures (1 and 10Pa) in the chamber and constant laser fluence (10J/cm2). As seen from the SEM images (Fig. 4 ), at low Ar pressure (1Pa) the surface morphology of the film shows similar nature as that deposited in vacuum and there is also no significant change in the particle size and density. But in the film deposited at 10Pa Ar pressure, the particle size and density decrease. The presence of gas molecules during laser ablation causes plume confinement effect due to collisions between the ablated particles and gas molecules [16]. Collisions stop the particles growth in the plume before they arrive to the substrate surface. The efficiency of collisional cooling depends strongly on the density of the gas molecules in the plume. The films do not exhibit any peak in the XRD spectra indicating an amorphous nature which enhances the catalytic activity due to its unique short-range ordering but long-range disordering structure [17]. Surface composition of the deposited catalysts was analyzed by using XPS and FT-IR techniques. XPS analysis, carried out on the surface of the catalyst, indicates that Co, B and even oxygen are present on the surface of both powder (Fig. 5 ) and film (Fig. 6 ). No significant changes in XPS spectra were observed in both the form of catalyst except the presence of chlorine atoms (Cl) contamination on the surface of film catalyst. In order to explain the lack of Cl on the powder surface and its presence on the deposited films, we note that laser ablation also involves the subsurface layers of the target material where Cl is present. The XPS spectra in Co 2p3/2 levels show the presence of cobalt species in form of metallic and oxide state corresponding to binding energies (BE) of 778.8 and 783.3eV, respectively [18,19]. There is no evidence of CoB or Co2B species but only of boron oxide (B2O3) and of Co(II)hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In B 1s level, however, only oxidized boron species were observed with the BE of 192.5eV [18]. In addition, XPS spectra in O 1s level clearly show the existence of cobalt and boron oxide on the surface of catalyst film and powder. By using the XPS spectra, the atomic ratio of B and Co on a given (small) area of the surface of catalyst powder is determined as 2.75 while, in case of the film, the ratio changes to 0.75. The atomic ratio of Cl atom contamination as (B+Cl)/Co is determined to be about 1 in the film. Accordingly to authors in Ref. [18], Co–B amorphous alloy produced by chemical method experiences the surface enrichment of the boron species, but in our case the film was deposited by ablating the target material also beneath the surface. Exact atomic ratio between Co and B is difficult to obtain because of the non-homogeneous nanoparticle distribution on the surface. Presence of species containing boron–oxygen in the film was also detected by FT-IR spectrum which shows the bands at frequencies attributable to the normal mode of vibration of borate BO2 − species (Fig. 7 ) [20]. In Fig. 8 we present the H2 yield and its production rate from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 using Co–B powder and the corresponding PLD-prepared thin films. The expected total amount of H2 has been measured no matter of the used catalyst. The generation rate initially increases (incubation time) to a maximum value and then decreases with time as expected for a first order reaction with respect to NaBH4 concentration. Thus, during hydrolysis, H2 generation rate decreases with time because the NaBH4 concentration decreases in the solution. Reproducibility of the films synthesized by PLD was established by obtaining approximately (the differences are lower than 5%) the same H2 generation rate by three films deposited at the same laser parameters. During the reaction, the catalyst films were quite stable in terms of hydrogen production. The maximum generation rate obtained by using the films (∼3300ml/[ming catalyst]) is about five times higher than that by using the powder (∼650ml/[ming catalyst]): this could be explained also in terms of the prevailing surface morphology effects in nanoparticle assembled films (Figs. 1 and 4). The average size of the nanoparticles is around 180–300nm for the all films and they are thought to be highly active sites for the hydrolysis reaction even at low concentration of NaBH4 and room temperature. These active Co–B nanoparticles promote the hydrogen production immediately after coming in contact with the solution, as seen by the high initial H2 generation rate (Fig. 8). To understand more about this aspect, the H2 generation rate was measured for films deposited using different laser energies (Fig. 9 ) and Ar gas pressures (Fig. 10 ). The catalyst films deposited at highest laser energy and lowest Ar gas pressure showed a significant increase in H2 generation rate. As showed in Table 1 ., the particle size and density is higher when film is deposited using higher laser fluence (5 and 10J/cm2) and low gas pressure which in turn increases the average roughness (R a) of the film. Thus, the enhancement of the catalytic activity is possibly attributable to an increase in the particle size and density. We cannot hitherto quantify the role of the surface area but a specific work is being planned to address also this aspect. In Co–B amorphous catalyst, partial electron transfer from alloying B to vacant d-orbital of metallic Co makes it electron-rich and B electron deficient. Electron-enriched Co active sites repel the adsorption of oxygen atoms while the latter are strongly adsorbed by the electron-deficient B. In other words, alloying B effectively protects metal Co from oxidation [21]. To prove this mechanism, catalytic activity was tested for the pure Co film deposited using similar laser parameters as that to produce nanoparticles of Co–B. Hydrogen yield, for catalyst Co films, is only 20% and H2 generation rate is also very low (Fig. 8). This shows that Co metal alone cannot be used as efficient catalyst probably because of oxidation (oxygen is indeed signaled by EDS) which inhibits catalytic activity even though having nanoparticle morphology (Fig. 3) as for Co–B films. XPS and FTIR spectra show indeed the presence of Boron oxide again confirming our previous conclusion that alloying B could protect Co from oxidation. Maximum H2 generation rate for our Co–B catalyst films is about 3300ml/[ming catalyst], which is much higher than literature data reported for other catalysts, like Ru on IRA (378ml/[ming]) [3], Ni–B (233ml/[ming]) [22], Pt-LiCoO2 (1387ml/[ming]) [8]. Catalytic activity was tested using solution containing 1wt.% NaBH4 and 5wt.% NaOH for comparison. Only carbon supported Pt (Pt/C) shows higher H2 generation rate (23,000ml/[ming]) than our catalyst films [7]. However, Pt is one of the costliest materials and not preferable for the commercial use. Note that 1g of Co–B catalyst can produce about 0.6kW for PEMFC (0.7V) which is the requirement for the portable devices. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have synthesized Co–B nanoparticles thin films using PLD, which act as efficient catalyst for hydrolysis of NaBH4: this is the main result of our work. Films show higher performance when compared to the bulk powder which could be explained also in terms of the prevailing surface morphology effects in nanoparticle assembled films. Catalytic activity is increased further by increasing the number and average size of the nanoparticles. Cobalt can be used as catalyst only when alloyed with boron since it prevents cobalt from oxidation. Acknowledgments We acknowledge Romina Belli for SEM analysis.
