The development of efficient and cost-effective metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become crucial for electrochemical energy systems. However, reasonably validating and precisely regulating the active sites for designing optimized materials are still challenging. Herein, we report a precise and controllable tandem strategy to boost the ORR activity based on metal-free covalent organic frameworks (MFCOFs) comprising imine-N, thiophene-S, or triazine-N. Among these MFCOFs, post-tandem BTT-TAT-COF structure displayed a more positive catalytic capability and excellent electrochemical stability, indicating that the synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites induced the ORR catalytic activity through the conjugated skeleton of the structure. Density-functional theory calculations suggest that the series-connected backbone contained highly effective electrocatalytic active centers and provided synergistic catalysis. More importantly, this strategy highlights new opportunities for the advancement of efficient COF-based metal-free ORR catalysts. Graphical Abstract A precise and controllable tandem strategy is developed to boost the oxygen reduction activity based on metal-free covalent organic frameworks, which comprise imine-N, thiophene-S, or triazine-N. The series-connected units induce unique electron density redistribution as a result of the activated conjugated skeleton of the structure, engendering their synergistic catalysis. Keywords Covalent organic frameworks Metal-free electrocatalyst Tandem strategy Synergistic catalysis Oxygen reduction reaction Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in efficient energy conversion technologies with low environmental pollution, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries [1,2]. However, the applications of these technologies have been limited due to the sluggish kinetics of the ORR without appropriate and effective electrocatalysts [3,4]. Currently, Pt, which is a noble metal, is considered as the most active catalyst for ORR. However, the disadvantages associated with the Pt-based catalysts, such as scarcity, high cost, and vulnerable stability, have limited their large-scale applications [5–7]. Therefore, it is crucial to explore novel high-performance ORR catalysts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [8–11] are an emerging class of crystalline, porous polymers that have shown promising prospects as metal-free catalysts [12–15] owing to their unique structural features, such as tunable pore sizes, large surface areas, ordered network structures, and excellent mass transport ability. Moreover, flexible adjustment of their structure and high-precision control of their catalytically active centers make them appropriate candidates for ORR catalysts. Unfortunately, most pristine COFs intrinsically possess inappreciable ORR catalytic performance because of the absence of catalytically active sites and poor electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, the use of COF-derived heteroatom-doped carbon materials has been considered as an effective method for high-performance ORR electrocatalysts [16,17]. However, most of these materials do not retain the advantages associated with pristine COFs due to the structural deformation and disordered atomic-level position of active centers during the uncontrollable pyrolysis process [18,19]. Recently, pristine COFs obtained via in situ heteroatom doping with structural tunability, high atomic precision, high charge-carrier mobility, and tight π-stacking have been explored as ORR electrocatalysts [20–22]. In addition, π-electron-rich components including porphyrin [23–25], phthalocyanine [26,27], imine [28], triazine [29], and thiophene [30] are considered as active centers owing to their rapid electronic transportation for the ORR. Furthermore, the chemical bonds of O2 molecules are easily broken by the uneven charge distribution and additional charge transfer induced by the introduction of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen or sulfur, onto carbon frameworks, which improves the electrocatalytic activity during the ORR [31–33]. In particular, the heterocycles of six- or five-membered rings are generally preferred as suitable ORR building units because the heteroatoms with lone electron pairs can easily disturb the charge distribution and spin density of the frameworks [34,35]. Thus, we aim to build high-performance COF-based, metal-free ORR catalysts using a concatenating heteroatom component strategy to achieve precise catalytic structures and synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites. Herein, we propose a precise and controllable tandem strategy to synthesize a novel BTT-TAT-COF for radically boosting the ORR performance of metal-free covalent organic frameworks (MFCOFs) via the synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites. These MFCOFs, with imine-N, thiophene-S, or triazine-N units, feature heteroatoms on the carbon frameworks and can produce local charge transfer within their conjugated backbones. Moreover, the electron-accepting triazine and electron-donating units of imine or thiophene could lead to positive charges on the adjacent carbon atoms, and the high active-center densities effectively induce O2 coordination and the ORR [36]. As an ORR electrocatalyst, BTT-TAT-COF with imine-N, thiophene-S, and triazine-N units in series exhibited better ORR performance than that shown by imine-N and thiophene-S-constructed BTT-TAPB-COF, while BTT-TAPB-COF showed better performance than that shown by imine-N-constructed TFPB-TAPB-COF. The remarkable improvement in the ORR performance of the as-synthesized MFCOFs validated the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites was supported by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work may provide new insights into the advancement of efficient COF-based metal-free ORR catalysts. Scheme 1(a) shows an illustration of the tandem synthetic procedures of the three MFCOFs; their molecular skeletons are constructed by repeating units of imine, five-membered ring thiophene, or six-membered ring triazine (Scheme 1(b) and Figs. 1(a)–(c) ). The novel 2D BTT-TAT-COF was synthesized through the solvothermal Schiff base condensation reaction of benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b’:5,6-b’’] trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde (BTT) and 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TAT) at a molar ratio of 1:1 in a solvent mixture of o-dichlorobenzene, n-butyl alcohol, and 6 mol/L acetic acid (10:10:1, v:v:v) at 120 °C for 72 h (Scheme S3). For comparison, we also prepared BTT-TAPB-COF with the TAPB monomer instead of TAT under similar conditions (Scheme S4). To investigate the role of thiophene-S, only imine-N-constructed TFPB-TAPB-COF was prepared according to a previously reported method (Scheme S5) [37]. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and solid 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C CP/MAS NMR) analyses were used to determine the skeletal structure and imine linkage formation of the MFCOFs. The FT-IR spectra (Figs. S1–S3) exhibited peaks located at 1600, 1612, and 1616 cm−1 for TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF, respectively, which are typical characteristic peaks of C=N. The disappearance of the C=O and N–H stretching vibration peaks confirmed that the MFCOFs were indeed constructed through Schiff base reactions. Additionally, the characteristic resonance signals at 148.3, 150.3, and 151.2 ppm in the solid 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra (Figs. S4–S6) correspond to the newly formed imine carbons of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF, respectively. The crystallinity and unit cell parameters of the as-prepared MFCOFs were analyzed through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements in combination with theoretical simulations and Pawley refinement (Figs. 1(d)–(f)). The theoretically simulated models of the MFCOFs were obtained using the Materials Studio software package. BTT-TAT-COF exhibited a long-range ordered structure, displaying an intense peak at 4.64° (2θ), which corresponds to the (100) diffraction. Diffraction peaks at 8.04°, 9.29°, 12.29°, 16.78°, and 25.31° were attributed to the (110), (200), (210), (310), and (001) diffractions, respectively (Fig. 1(f)). The 2θ peaks at 4.59°, 7.95°, 9.18°, 12.15°, 16.59°, and 25.34° for BTT-TAPB-COF were attributed to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (310), and (001) planes, respectively (Fig. 1(e)), whereas those at 3.85°, 6.67°, 7.70°, 10.19°, 13.90°, and 25.70° for TFPB-TAPB-COF were attributed to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (310), and (001) planes, respectively (Fig. 1(d)). The experimental PXRD patterns of the MFCOFs were well fitted with the simulated patterns of the eclipsed stacking (AA) model in the P6? (No. 174) space group (Figs. S7–S9 and Tables S1–S3). Pawley refinement gave the optimized unit cell parameters as follows: a = b = 21.5453 Å, c = 3.4962 Å, α = β = 90.00°, and γ = 120.00°, with R-weighted pattern (wRp) = 4.39% and R-pattern (Rp) = 3.23% for BTT-TAT-COF; a = b = 21.5395 Å, c = 3.6054 Å, α = β = 90.00°, and γ = 120.00°, with wRp = 3.41% and Rp = 2.59% for BTT-TAPB-COF; a = b = 25.6603 Å, c = 3.8263 Å, α = β = 90.00°, and γ = 120.00°, with wRp = 3.11% and Rp = 2.31% for TFPB-TAPB-COF. These results demonstrate that the three MFCOFs were in their predicted crystalline frameworks. The specific surface areas and porous features of the MFCOFs were examined by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at 77 K. As shown in Fig. 2(a) , the three MFCOFs exhibited type-I adsorption isotherms. The significantly increased N2 adsorption capacity at low relative pressures (P/P 0 < 0.03) suggested the typical micropore characteristics of the MFCOFs. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (Fig. S11 and Table S4) of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF were 111.2, 1070.0, and 868.5 m2 g−1, respectively. Frameworks with high specific surface areas expose sufficient catalytic sites and expedite the mass transfer of oxygen, thus promoting the ORR process [38]. To obtain electrocatalysts with a preferable specific surface area, the as-synthesized MFCOFs were activated using supercritical CO2 treatment following a previously reported method [39]. A larger N2 adsorption capacity was observed in the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the post-activated MFCOFs (Fig. S11), demonstrating the superior specific surface areas of MFCOFs. The BET surface areas (Figs. 2(a), S12, and Table S4) of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF increased significantly to 321.7, 1303.9, and 1006.7 m2 g−1, respectively. The porous features of the MFCOFs were than 2.0 nm, as determined through DFT calculations, which was close to the theoretical value (Figs. S13 and S14). Notably, excellent crystallinity of MFCOFs was observed (Fig. S10) after supercritical CO2 treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figs. 2(c)–(f) and S15–S17) indicated that TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF exhibited cluster-like nanosheets, short rod-like structures, and clavate-like morphology with particle sizes larger than 200 nm, respectively. The EDS-based elemental mapping (Figs. 2(f), S16, and S17) showed homogeneously distributed C, N, and S elements within the MFCOFs. Furthermore, the MFCOFs exhibited excellent thermal stability, with thermal decomposition temperatures above 350 °C (Fig. S18). Moreover, the chemical stability of BTT-TAT-COF was evaluated after immersion in various solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), hexane, toluene (Tol), boiling water, 12 mol/L HCl, and 12 mol/L KOH) for at least 24 h. The crystallinity of BTT-TAT-COF was almost unchanged after the treatment (Fig. 2(b)), confirming its excellent chemical stability for the ORR. The electrocatalytic activities of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF were investigated using a conventional three-electrode system in an O2-saturated 0.1 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the MFCOFs in Fig. 3(a) demonstrate that BTT-TAT-COF showed more efficient ORR activity than that shown by BTT-TAPB-COF, while BTT-TAPB-COF showed better performance than that shown by TFPB-TAPB-COF. The half-wave potential (Figs. 3(a) and S19) of BTT-TAT-COF was 0.77 V (vs. RHE), which was 60 and 120 mV higher than those of BTT-TAPB-COF (0.71 V vs. RHE) and TFPB-TAPB-COF (0.65 V vs. RHE), respectively. The advanced activity of BTT-TAT-COF was ascribed to the series-wound connection of the heteroatomic active centers of imine-N, thiophene-S, and triazine-N. Notably, the half-wave and onset potential values of BTT-TAT-COF outperformed most of the pristine metal-free COF-based ORR catalysts; they were even better than those of some metal-free COF-derived carbon catalysts (Table S5). The improvement in ORR activity was further identified by the Tafel slope (Fig. 3(b)), where a much lower slope of 71.0 mV dec−1 was observed for BTT-TAT-COF. As shown in Figs. 3(c) and S20, the electron transfer number (n) and H2O2 yield (%) in the ORR were further measured using the RRDE method, and a higher n value and lower H2O2 yield of BTT-TAT-COF were obtained among these MFCOFs. Similarly, n values were analyzed through the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation (Figs. S21–S25) at 0.2 V (vs. RHE); the value of BTT-TAT-COF (3.66) was higher than those of BTT-TAPB-COF (3.53) and TFPB-TAPB-COF (2.74). Significantly, the n value of BTT-TAT-COF was approximately 4.0 at a high potential (Fig. 3(c)), demonstrating a close four-electron reaction process of the BTT-TAT-COF electrocatalyst in the ORR. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the MFCOFs were obtained via their electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) values to evaluate the effective surface area involved in the ORR. The Cdl of BTT-TAT-COF extracted from the J (at 0.95 V) versus scan rate line was 13.7 mF cm−2, which remarkably outperformed BTT-TAPB-COF (9.0 mF cm−2) and TFPB-TAPB-COF (5.5 mF cm−2) (Figs. S26–S29). The intrinsic activity of the MFCOFs was appraised by the turnover frequency (TOF) at 0.7 V (vs. RHE). Assuming that all the N and S atoms acted as active sites, the TOF values (Fig. 3(d)) of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF were calculated as 0.0009, 0.0025, and 0.0028 s−1, respectively. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 3(d), BTT-TAT-COF exhibited a remarkable mass activity of 15.23 A g−1, which is 1.6 and 10.4 times higher than those of BTT-TAPB-COF (9.28 A g−1) and TFPB-TAPB-COF (1.46 A g−1), respectively. These results demonstrated that BTT-TAT-COF exhibited the best ORR activity among the MFCOFs owing to its abundant active sites and effective synergy of its functionalized active sites. The stability of BTT-TAT-COF was tested by chronoamperometry at 0.7 V (vs. RHE). The BTT-TAT-COF catalyst retained 86.3% of its current density after 12 h (Fig. 3(e)), which suggests its favorable long-term stability. Moreover, a small decrease in the current density was observed upon the introduction of methanol in the electrolyte at 400 s (Fig. 3(f)), which indicates that the BTT-TAT-COF exhibited excellent methanol tolerance. Aqueous Zn-air batteries (ZABs) were installed to assess the potential application value of the BTT-TAT-COF electrocatalyst. The BTT-TAT-COF-based ZAB exhibited a power density of ~118 mW cm−2 at 0.6 V (Fig. S30), maximum voltage of 1.24 V at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, and persistent galvanostatic discharge process where the voltage only decreased by 100 mV for 70 h (Fig. 3(g)). Furthermore, three ZABs in series using BTT-TAT-COF as cathodes successfully lit a “SCUT” LED panel (Fig. 3(g) inset), confirming that MFCOF can be considered as a feasible electrocatalyst in metal-air batteries. To investigate the electrocatalytic mechanism of the three MFCOFs, DFT calculations were conducted to understand their ORR performances under various alkaline conditions [40–42]. We constructed three computational models that included repeating structural units of TFPB-TAPB-COF, BTT-TAPB-COF, and BTT-TAT-COF (Figs. 4(a)–(c) ). The post-tandem BTT-TAT-COF had the narrowest band gap near the Fermi level (set as the zero-point energy) in these models, and BTT-TAPB-COF exhibited a narrower band gap than TFPB-TAPB-COF (Fig. 4(d)). Thus, the BTT-TAT-COF model, with its constricted band gap, may stimulate electron transfer and enhance ORR activities compared with those of TFPB-TAPB-COF and BTT-TAPB-COF. Similar results were observed in the gaps of model compounds of the MFCOFs between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) [43,44]. The LUMO-HOMO gap (3.27 eV for BTT-TAT-COF) (Fig. 4(e)) was lower than those of TFPB-TAPB-COF (3.80 eV) and BTT-TAPB-COF (3.51 eV). Furthermore, Gibbs free energy (ΔG) diagrams of the three structures were used to analyze the overpotential for the ORR. The carbon atom (site 1, TFPB-TAPB-1) near the imine-N unit showed the lowest overpotential (1.45 eV) in TFPB-TAPB-COF (Table S6). When thiophene-S units replaced the phenyl units, the BTT-TAPB-5 exhibited a lower overpotential of 1.39 eV (Table S7) compared to that of TFPB-TAPB-1. Similarly, when triazine-N units were introduced to supersede the phenyl units, the overpotential of BTT-TAT-5 decreased significantly to 1.10 eV (Table S8). These results indicate that imine-N, thiophene-S, and triazine-N induced a positive ORR process. Furthermore, the overpotentials of carbon atoms (BTT-TAT-5, 9, and 10) were lower than those of all the sites in BTT-TAPB-COF and TFPB-TAPB-COF (Fig. 4(f) and Tables S6–S8), thereby demonstrating the synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites. The theoretical calculation concluded that BTT-TAT-COF showed the best ORR catalytic activity, which agrees well with the experimental results. In conclusion, we proposed a new tandem strategy to boost the ORR performance of COFs as metal-free electrocatalysts. The proposed strategy avoids the use of uncontrollable pyrolysis process, thus enabling precise and controllable atomic-level ordering of the catalyst structures. The resultant novel catalyst BTT-TAT-COF demonstrated enhanced ORR performance and excellent stability that exceeded those of BTT-TAPB-COF and TFPB-TAPB-COF. The synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites, such as imine-N, thiophene-S, and triazine-N, was verified by DFT calculations. These findings clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy to boost ORR performance and may provide new insights into the construction of efficient COF-based metal-free ORR catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The development of efficient and cost-effective metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become crucial for electrochemical energy systems. However, reasonably validating and precisely regulating the active sites for designing optimized materials are still challenging. Herein, we report a precise and controllable tandem strategy to boost the ORR activity based on metal-free covalent organic frameworks (MFCOFs) comprising imine-N, thiophene-S, or triazine-N. Among these MFCOFs, post-tandem BTT-TAT-COF structure displayed a more positive catalytic capability and excellent electrochemical stability, indicating that the synergistic catalysis of multiple active sites induced the ORR catalytic activity through the conjugated skeleton of the structure. Density-functional theory calculations suggest that the series-connected backbone contained highly effective electrocatalytic active centers and provided synergistic catalysis. More importantly, this strategy highlights new opportunities for the advancement of efficient COF-based metal-free ORR catalysts.",
