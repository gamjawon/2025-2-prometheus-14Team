The mesoionic carbene iron complex is a new catalyst, and its catalytic mechanisms for the nitrene transfer reactions were investigated via density functional theory calculations. Especially, the amination-to-aziridination chemoselectivity is predicted for the first time. The origin of the chemoselectivity toward C(sp3)–H amination has been revealed. Based on our calculated results, it can be suggested that the substrate scope of this novel catalytic system may be expanded to alkenes to greatly broaden its potential applications in constructing N-heterocyclic compounds.

The formation of C–N bond is the key step for these N-heterocyclic synthesis. The strategy of nitrene transfer into C–H (i.e., amination) or C=C bond (i.e., aziridination) to directly afford C–N bond has generated strong interest due to its atomic and step economy [1–4]. For this strategy, organic azides are appealing nitrene precursors with the advantage of only N2 as a harmless side product [5,6]. Many intramolecular nitrene transfer reactions mediated by transition-metal such as Fe [7–10], Co [11–13], Ni [14,15], Ru [16,17], Pd [18,19] and Ir [20] with azides have been reported. Most of these reports, however, require to protect the released amine and to avoid recoordination by the use of the addition of Boc2O, which results in considerable amounts of waste and deteriorates the atom economy of these reactions. Additionally, the reactivity and selectivity are ongoing challenges due to C–H bond inertness and multiple potential reactive sites in the substrates [21–23]. Therefore, designing new metal catalysts to effectively and selectively obtain a single targeted product has been a long-standing goal in the study of nitrene transfer reactions. Iron is a base metal with advantages of earth-abundance, cost-efficiency and low toxicity [24,25], and thus it is highly desirable to apply iron catalysis for nitrene transfer reactions [26,27]. Recently, Albrecht and co-workers reported a new C,O-chelating homoleptic iron complex that can catalyze intramolecular C–H amination by using aliphatic or aromatic azide substrates in toluene-d 8 at 120 °C (Scheme 1 ) [28]. These reactions display unprecedentedly high turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 7600 with good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the additive Boc2O or other protecting groups are not required for the catalysis to proceed efficiently. However, although these reactions catalyzed by this new iron-mesoionic carbene catalyst are of great application potential, their detailed mechanism remains unclear up to now. Especially, their amination-to-aziridination chemoselectivity is unexplored in both theory and experiment, which greatly limits further development of these reactions. Our group has engaged in computational studies on nitrene transfer reactions [29–33]. Herein, theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the mechanisms and chemoselectivity of nitrene transfer reactions catalyzed by this new iron-mesoionic carbene complex, especially to clarify the controlling factors of the chemoselectivity. 2 Computational methods The system studied is very large and geometrical simplication will change the crystal conformation of the catalyst. In order to obtain reliable computation results, we do not perform any geometrical simplication for the large catalytic system. All calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian 09 software packages [34]. The geometrics of all reported species were optimized in the gas-phase by using the (U)B3LYP density functional with Grimme's D3 dispersion correction. The (U)B3LYP-D3 method described well the energies and geometries of iron species involved in multiple pathways based on previously reports [35–37]. The 6–31 G (d) basis sets were used for C, H, N and O atoms and SDD basis sets (with corresponding Hay-Wadt effective core potential (ECP)) were used for Fe atom (denoted as BS1). For open-shell singlet state calculations, wavefunction stability tests were carried out with “stable=opt” to ensure that these wavefunctions were stable. All optimized structures were characterized as transition state structures (one imaginary frequency) or minima (zero imaginary frequencies) by frequency analysis. To improve energetics of the reported structures, single-point energy calculations in solvent (toluene) were performed based on the continuum solvation model at the (U)B3LYP level of theory with a larger mixed basis set of 6–311++G(d,p) for C, H, N and O atoms and SDD for Fe (with the ECP) (denoted as BS2). The reported enthalpies in the text were single-point energies in solvent incorporating corresponding corrections to enthalpies in gas-phase. All thermodynamic data discussed are calculated at 393 K and 1 atm. Cartesian coordinates for all reported structures are given in the Supporting Information. CYLview visualization software was used to display the 3D optimized structures [38]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characteristics of iron-catalyst The C,O-chelating iron complex (denoted as [Fe]) is a recently reported new catalyst in which two mesoionic carbenes are coordinated to iron center, forming two six-membered chelating rings (such as Fe-C1-C2-C3-C4-O1 in Fig. 1 ). This six-membered ring structure has less stability compared to the five-membered chelating rings that were commonly in the present of previously reported Fe- and Ru-catalyst [39,40]. It is well-known that iron species has multiple possible spin states. For this new Fe-catalyst, the calculated energies of the triplet, css- and oss-singlet states are 8.8, 18.9 and 19.7 kcal/mol higher than the quintet, indicative of quintet catalyst 5[Fe] as the most stable ground-state structure, consistent with the experimental observations [28]. Fig. 1 shows the important bond lengths and angles from calculations and experiments for quintet 5[Fe]. The relative errors between calculated and experimental data are small, which demonstrate the reliability of the computational methods in this work. Structurally, two π–π stacking interactions between the phenyl ring and N-mesitylene (N-Mes) group stabilize the Fe-catalyst. Electronically, two strongly electron-donating carbene ligands make the iron center highly electron-rich, thus facilitating the formation of the nitrene intermediate in the reaction process (vide infra). 3.2 Catalytic mechanism The importance of nitrogen in the benzylic position of pharmacophores can be gleaned by its appearance in top-selling FDA approved drugs such as rivastigmine, clopidogrel, imatinib, meclizine, and sertraline [41,42]. Therefore, we choose a representative aromatic azide substrate (4-azido-4-methylpentyl) benzene (denoted as S1) to study the mechanism of iron-catalyzed intramolecular C–H amination, wherein nitrogen will be introduced into the benzylic position. The proposed catalytic mechanism is shown in Scheme S1. The reaction pathways of quintet, triplet, open- and close-shell singlet spin states were considered and calculated potential energy surfaces of these pathways are depicted in Fig. S1. Based on the comparison of energies in Fig. S1, the most preferrable pathway is chosen to investigate detailed mechanistic processes in the text. The whole mechanism is divided to two parts: the formation of mono-nitrene and subsequent catalytic cycle starting from mono-nitrene. Their potential energy surfaces are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the metal center Fe in quintet 5[Fe] reacts with the aromatic azide substrate S1 via a N2 extrusion transition state 5TS1 with a barrier of 20.1 kcal/mol, generating Fe-mono-nitrene intermediate Mono-5NI. Quintet Mono-5NI and triplet Mono-3NI is close in energy (−12.2 vs. −13.1 kcal/mol), thus both of them are possible spin states of mono-nitrene of the preferable pathway. Mono-nitrene is actually catalytic species for the subsequent catalytic cycle in Scheme S1 and Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, Mono-5NI, reacts with the substrate S1 via a second N2 extrusion at the transition state 5TS2, giving quintet Fe-bis-nitrene Bis-5NI1. The second N2 extrusion requires a barrier of 33.9 kcal/mol, higher than 20.1 kcal/mol for the first N2 extrusion. The Fe–Nα bond formation and N2 extrusion occur simultaneously, as seen from the reactive center Fe···Nα···Nβ=Nγ of the transition state 5TS2 and 5TS1. The formation of the Fe–Nα bond benefits to the N2 (Nβ Nγ) extrusion. An obviously longer Fe···Nα distance in 5TS2 vs. in 5TS1 (1.98 vs. 1.89 Å) indicates a lower degree of the formation of Fe-N bond in the former, thus a higher barrier for 5TS2 vs. 5TS1. In fact, the second N2 extrusion is the rate-limiting step of the whole reaction, consistent with the experimental observation [28]. In the next step, the C–C single bond of Bis-5NI1 rotates to form a near-reactive bis-nitrene Bis-5NI2 in which the reactive H atom is close to N2-nitrene atom, preparing for the ensuing H-atom abstraction. Then N2-nitrene atom in quintet Bis-5NI2 accepts one electron from the homolysis of the C–H bond via a quintet H-atom abstraction transition state 5TS3 with a barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol. This σC–H homolysis process (Bis-5NI2 → 5TS3 → 5IM) is also supported by the calculated spin density distribution (Table 1 ). The spins on N2-nitrene reduce gradually (1.55 → 1.17 → 0.66) and those on the C5 atom increase gradually (0.01 → 0.44 → 0.74). Finally, intermediate 5IM undergoes a barrierless radical rebound to generate the ring-closure amination product PC, accompanying with the release of the quintet mono-nitrene Mono-5NI. Mono-5NI can readily convert into triplet Mono-3NI. This conversion of the different spin states of metal-nitrenes is also found in the formation of Ru-nitrene [43]. 3.3 Chemoselectivity: amination vs. aziridination Alkenes are widely used as substrates for transition-metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions due to the present of the activated allylic C–H bond that has analogous reactivity with benzylic C–H bond. However, C=C bond in alkene is also the potential reactive site, which is absent for benzylic substrate. The oxidation of alkenes substrates typically results in mixtures of C–H- and π-bond functionalized products. Therefore, controlling amination-to-aziridination chemoselectivity is imperative to harness the full potential of mesoionic carbene iron-catalyzed reactions. Herein, we use allylic azide 6-Azido-6-methyl-1-hepten (denoted as S2) as the substrate to study amination-to-aziridination competition. The catalytic process and potential energy surfaces are illustrated in Scheme 2 , Fig. 4 and Fig. S2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the processes of the twice consecutive N2 extrusion for S2 are similar to those for S1: the reaction of Fe-catalyst with S2 via 5TS1’ gives mono-nitrene Mono-5NI’, which combines with a second S2 via 5TS2’ to afford bis-nitrene Bis-5NI1’. Through the rotation of C–C bond, Bis-5NI1’ converts into Bis-5NI2’. Noteworthily, Bis-5NI2’ has two possible reaction sites: C=C double bond and allyic C–H bond, thus leading to aziridination-to-amination competition. For C=C bond aziridination pathway (red), the N2-nitrene atom of Bis-5NI2’ accepts one electron from the homolysis of πC6=C7 via a quintet transition state 5TS3’A for the formation of the first C–N bond, yielding the radical intermediate 5IM’A (this step denoted as radical addition). Mulliken spin-density analysis of 5IM’A shows that 0.89 and 1.03 unpaired spins reside on N2-nitrene and C6 atoms, respectively. Subsequently, a quickly coupling of N2-nitrene and C7 biradicals forms the second C–N bond, yielding the final bicyclic aziridination product PC’A with the release of quintet Mono-5NI’. Alternatively, C–H amination occurs via a H-atom abstraction/radical rebound stepwise mechanism, generating the monocyclic amination product PC’I with the release of quintet Mono-5NI’. Kinetically, the energy barriers of 5TS3’A and 5TS3’I are 25.9 and 17.0 kcal/mol, respectively, and the former is 8.9 kcal/mol higher than the latter. Such a large difference in energy indicates that the pathway of C–H insertion is far more favourable than that of C=C aziridination. This high chemoselectivity toward amination stems presumably from steric effect. Bis‐5NI2’ is coordinately saturated octahedral species in which all ligands are bulky (see Fig. 5 ), resulting in sterically large congestion around N2‐nitrene atom. From nitrene Bis‐5NI2’ to transition states 5TS3’A / 5TS3’I Fe‐N bond is stretched (from 1.85 to 2.05/1.93 Å) via the cleavage of πFe=N bond for the formations of N–C/N–H bonds. The insertion of nitrene group into C=C bond vs. into C–H bond has sterically more demands [44]. In order to provide enough room for the formation of the N–C bond, Fe–N bond in 5TS3’A is stretched longer than that in 5TS3’I (2.05 vs. 1.93 Å), indicative of a larger cleavage degree of the πFe=N bond in 5TS3’A , and thus a higher barrier for 5TS3’A vs. 5TS3’I . In addition, the seven-membered ring in 5TS3’A has larger ring strain compared to the six-membered ring in 5TS3’I (see Fig. 5), which also disfavors C=C aziridination pathway. Thermodynamically, C–H insertion is more preferable due to a better stability for 5IM’I vs. 5IM’A (−19.7 vs. −5.5 kcal/mol). Based on analysis above, amine from C–H amination is still exclusive product despite the present of multiple potential reactive sites for the alkene substrate. Therefore, it can be suggested that the substrate scope of this new catalytic system may be expanded to alkenes to greatly broaden its potential applications in constructing N-heterocyclic amines. 4 Conclusions Iron-mesoionic carbene is a new and bulky catalyst. This work presents a theoretical investigation into the mechanisms and amination-to-aziridination chemoselectivity of intramolecular nitrene transfer reactions by this new catalyst. Quintet iron-mesoionic carbene catalyst combines with the azide substrate, undergoing twice consecutive N2 extrusions to generate Fe-bis-nitrene intermediate. Subsequently, the Fe-bis-nitrene proceeds via H-abstraction/radical rebound, affording the final monocyclic amination products. Alternatively, Fe-bis-nitrene can also undergo C=C bond radical addition/rebound to yield bicyclic aziridination products. The second N2 extrusion is the rate-limiting step of the whole reaction. Most of importantly, our calculations for the first time predict that allylic C–H amination would be heavily favored over C=C aziridination for this catalytic system with the alkene azide as substrate. A larger cleavage degree of Fe-N bond and a larger ring strain in the transition state of nitrene insertion into C=C bond vs. insertion into C–H bond result in a higher barrier for aziridination. Hopefully, these calculated results will facilitate the further development of Fe-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions.

Especially, the amination-to-aziridination chemoselectivity is predicted for the first time. The origin of the chemoselectivity toward C(sp3)–H amination has been revealed. Based on our calculated results, it can be suggested that the substrate scope of this novel catalytic system may be expanded to alkenes to greatly broaden its potential applications in constructing N-heterocyclic compounds.",
