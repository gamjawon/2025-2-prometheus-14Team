Graphical abstract In the catalytic cracking reaction, acetic acid is protonated to form the ketene and acetyl cation. Subsequently, ketene further reacts with methoxide to produce CO and C2H4. Catalytic cracking of carboxylic acids is regaining great interest in the upgrading of biomass-derived oxygenates. Herein, the catalytic cracking mechanism of acetic acid on HZSM-5 catalyst was studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that acetic acid is firstly protonated, followed by the α-hydrogen transferring to produce 1,1-ethylene glycol, which is subsequently dehydrated to form ketene. The ketene-formation step of this mechanism is found to be the rate-determining step with an activation barrier of 45.23kcal/mol. The as-formed ketene intermediate continues to react with the HZSM-5 catalyst, generating acetyl cation with a small activation barrier of 3.00kcal/mol. Moreover, it is found that the as-formed acetyl cation is difficult to be further decomposed, resulting in the accumulation of intermediate products of acetyl cation and ketene. Meanwhile, the ketene further reacts with methoxide, resulting in the final formation of carbon monoxide and ethylene. Keywords Catalytic cracking Acetic acid Acetyl cation HZSM-5 DFT 1 Introduction With the increasing demand for fossil fuels and growing concerns on climate change, biomass-derived hydrocarbon fuel (i.e., biomass oil) has gained significant attention as alternative energy sources [1]. As a renewable and carbon-neutral fuel source, it has become a hot research topic nowadays [2]. Typically, there are two methods to synthesize biomass oil, i.e., biomass pyrolysis and liquefaction [3]. The as-synthesized biomass oil usually contains abundant oxygen derivatives, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and aldehydes, which must be further refined in order to obtain qualified gasoline, diesel and other fuels [4,5]. Among others, the conversion of carboxylic acids is one of the required refining steps due to its high content in the bio-oil [6]. This conversion of carboxylic acids can be achieved by the catalytic cracking, which is a promising strategy to convert carboxylic acid molecules into hydrocarbons through the decarboxylation process on catalysts. To date, much attention has been focused on the catalysts for the catalytic cracking reaction of carboxylic acids [7–9]. Zeolitic materials are being extensively used in the area of petroleum refining [10]. The zeolites catalyst, e.g. ZSM-5, shows superior performance for a variety of reactions such as catalytic cracking, alkylation, aromatization, isomerization of hydrocarbons owing to their tunable acidity, high crystallinity and confinement effect [11–13]. Adjaye et al. [14] reported that HZSM-5 catalyst could achieve a high conversion of propanoic acid by the catalytic cracking reaction. A similar study using HZSM-5 catalyst also showed good performance for acetic acid conversion [15]. Chen et al. [16] studied catalytic cracking of acetic acid on HZSM-5 zeolite, and found that the main products are aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to better design highly efficient catalysts, many researchers pay special attention to the catalytic cracking mechanism of carboxylic acids, especially the key intermediates on catalyst surface [17]. Acetic acid, as a small molecule carboxylic acid, is usually selected as a model compound to study the reaction mechanism and its corresponding intermediate products [18]. Pulido et al. [19] found that the reaction mechanism for the ketonic decarboxylation of acetic acid over monoclinic zirconia involves an α-hydrogen abstraction step. Phung et al. [20] used the in situ infrared spectroscopy to study the reaction mechanism of acetic acid on Al2O3, and detected the presence of the ketene intermediate. However, little attention has been focused on the catalytic cracking mechanism of acetic acid and its intermediate products over zeolite catalysts. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the intermediate products on acidic zeolites in order to instruct the design of new catalyst for the catalytic cracking of carboxylic acids. In this work, we report a systematic DFT study to elucidate the catalytic cracking mechanism of carboxylic acids on HZSM-5 zeolite using acetic acid as a model compound. The reaction pathway for the decomposition of acetic acid is investigated, which involves the generation of ketene intermediate and the secondary reaction between the intermediate and HZSM-5 or methoxide. Moreover, it is found that the acetyl cation can be formed by the protonation of ketene with a small activation energy barrier. The computational findings not only give mechanistic interpretation on experimental results but also shed new light on the principle to design more efficient catalysts for the catalytic cracking of carboxylic acids. 2 Models and Methods 2.1 Zeolite models ZSM-5 as a kind of important microporous zeolite is composed of SiO4 and AlO4. It features 10-ring channels running along the crystallographic b-axis, which intersect with 10-ring sinusoidal channels running along the a-axis, all of which exhibit a diameter of ca. 5.5Å [21]. 10-ring channel means that the channel consists of 10 silicon or aluminum atoms. The cluster models of ZSM-5 were all constructed at the intersection of the 10-ring straight and sinusoidal channels. The crystal structure of ZSM-5 zeolite is composed of 12 different kinds of T atoms (T atom refers to Al or Si atom) with different space environment, which are labeled as T1-T12. When the silicon atom (tetravalent on the skeleton) is replaced by aluminum atom which has charge of plus three, a negative charge is introduced into the system and this negative charge can be compensated by a proton or a metal ion [22]. The proton exchanged HZSM-5 can show high catalytic activity, which is mainly through the formation of Brønsted acid sites between the Si and Al, centered on O, in the zeolite framework. In this paper, 46T model (Fig. 1 ) is used to represent the HZSM-5. It contains a complete straight channel and a sinusoidal channel to reflect the confinement effect of pore structure. This same model has also been employed in previous literatures [23–25]. It is widely accepted that T12, locating at the intersection of the sinusoidal channel and the straight channel, is the most possible position where Al replaces Si in the ZSM-5 [26,27]. The corresponding H proton is located on the oxygen atom between the two T12 sites. In order to ensure the consistency of the framework, the H is used to make the saturation of the dangling bonds previously connected to the selected Si-O model in the 46T model. It is constrained to prevent the destruction of the channel structure in the process of geometric optimization. To reduce the computational time and prevent the deformation of the zeolite framework in the process of geometry optimization, the 8T model of the relaxation is chose to be the active region. The 8T region is stressed by ball and stick model in Fig. 1. For the adsorbed complex model, the 8T model and the adsorbed molecules are optimized, and the rest part is fixed. 2.2 Computational details All calculations were performed using DMol3 module of Materials Studio 8.0 (MS) [28,29]. The module is able to deal with the molecular in the gas phase, the solution and the solid surface by using the density functional theory. The meta generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) in the M06-L parameterization was used in all calculations [30,31]. With the consideration of electronic polarization effect, the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set was used in the calculation. In benchmarking calculation, Truhlar and co-workers demonstrated that, for bingding in zeolite clusters, the M06-L functional gives a mean unsigned error of only 0.87kcal/mol [32,33]. The transition state was completely determined by LST/QST [34,35]. The transition states have only one imaginary frequency which corresponds to the expected motion of atoms for each transition structure [36]. The allowable deviations of the total energy, gradient and displacement were 1.0×10−5 Ha, 0.002Ha/Ǻ and 0.005Ǻ, respectively. Brillouin-zone integrations was performed using a Methfessel-Paxton smearing of 0.005Ha. All energies reported are bare potential energies. Energetics corrected by zero point vibrational energy and free-energy corrections at different temperatures are provided in the Supporting information. The corrections do not change any of the computed trends. The adsorption energy was calculated in the standard fashion as Ea = Eads + cat − Eads − Ecat Where Ea represents the adsorption energy of adsorbate, Eads+cat is the total energy of the adsorbate on the respective catalyst, Eads is the gas phase adsorbate energy, and Ecat is the energy of the bare catalyst. Based on this convention, a negative value would indicate an exothermic adsorption process. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Adsorption of acetic acid The adsorption of acetic acid on HZSM-5 is first investigated. Due to the restriction of pore size, the most stable adsorption configuration of acetic acid is located in the intersection of the sinusoidal channel and the straight channel. Its adsorption configuration is shown in Fig. 2 , and the changes of geometry parameters and Mulliken charge before and after adsorption are presented in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the distance between OA located in the framework and hydrogen proton increases from 0.966Å to 1.026Å. The SiOA Al bond angle decreases by 0.6° after acetic acid adsorption. This shows that the hydrogen proton has a tendency to transfer from the bridged oxygen to the carbonyl group, which makes it very easy to be protonated. Meanwhile, the distance between hydrogen proton and OB or OC located in the zeolite framework is in the range of 2.347∼2.450Å, and the OB H distance is reduced after adsorption. The results show that the strong hydrogen bonding interaction has already existed between the hydrogen proton and the zeolite framework. The adsorption structure is more stable on the basis of the strong hydrogen bonding interaction. The Mulliken charge is further analyzed to explain the adsorption process. It can also be seen in Table 1 that the charge of H increases from original 0.388|e| to 0.540|e| of the absorption compound. The charge of O1 is further reduced, which leads to the increase of the positive charge of C1. It shows that the H has a tendency to be separated from the bridged oxygen and protonation has affected the CO double bond. As the positive charge of α-hydrogen increasing, the α-hydrogen is more likely to attack the negatively charged atoms. The calculated adsorption energy of acetic acid is −28.81kcal/mol. However, it should be noted that there is no reported experimental value of its adsorption energy. To prove the rationality of the adsorption energy, the calculated adsorption energy of ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetone are shown in Table 2 . It is seen that the calculated adsorption energies of ethanol and acetone are −30.84 and −32.61kcal/mol, which are in good agreement with the experimental value of −31.00±1 and −31.20±1kcal/mol. This shows the rationality of the selected calculation model and parameters. The adsorption energies of ethanol and acetone are larger than that of acetic acid mainly because of the electron effect of H and CH3. With the increase of the negative charge of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, it is more likely to interact with the hydrogen proton. However, the adsorption energy of acetaldehyde is smaller than that of acetic acid, which is mainly due to the weak interaction between the hydroxyl group and zeolite framework. All the above results confirm that the adsorption energy of acetic acid is in a reasonable range. 3.2 Decomposition of acetic acid Although acid catalyst shows high activity towards catalytic cracking of carboxylic acid, the reaction mechanism and its intermediate products were rarely reported. It is noted that CO can react with methoxide on H-MOR catalyst to produce the acetyl cation, and the water molecule further reacts with acetyl cation to form the acetic acid [39]. In addition, the intermediate product of acetyl cation is the key to the formation of other products [40]. It is then anticipated that the presence of the strongly acidic protons in zeolites may promote the formation of surface acyl species rather than carboxylates. However, the reaction route of converting acetic acid to acetyl cation is difficult to achieve due to the unique pore structure of HZSM-5, which promotes the interaction between acetyl cation and water molecules. Thus, we focus on the α-hydrogen of acetic acid, which is closely related to the intermediate product of ketene. The calculated energy profile is shown in Fig. 3 . The initial step starts with adsorption of an acetic acid molecule on the Brønsted acid site of zeolite, accompanied by the hydrogen-bonding interaction. Then, the distance between O1 and H decreases from 1.532Å to 0.964Å by the formation of 1,1- ethylene glycol. It shows that the CO double bond is protonated, and the hydroxyl group in the intermediate product is formed by H and O1. Meanwhile, α-hydrogen transfers to the zeolite framework, followed by the formation of the bridge hydroxyl group. Under the restriction of the pore structure, the adsorption configuration of the transition state (TS1-A) is in a plane shape, which makes it more stable. The activation barrier for this step is 39.87kcal/mol. In the next step, the Int_A_2 can carry out dehydration reaction, and the distance between Hd and O1 decreases from 2.23Å to 0.97Å to form OH bond. At the same time, the CO bond breaks down with an activation barrier of 45.23kcal/mol. It is the rate-determining step in the decomposition process of acetic acid. At the end of the decomposition pathway, the ketene intermediate is obtained. The existence of the ketene has been observed on the TiO2 and Al2O3 by using the IR method [19,20]. It indicates that even in different types of catalysts, ketene exists in the catalytic reaction of carboxylic acids. It is worth noting that the reaction pathway is very similar to that of the thermal cracking of the carboxylic acid mentioned by Jared et al. [41,42] which is shown in Fig. 4 . In their research, the acetic acid also has a similar two-step decomposition pathways to form a ketene. In the thermal cracking reaction pathways of acetic acid, the first step is the generation of 1,1-ethylene glycol, which is the rate-determining step with an activation barrier of 70.30kcal/mol. The subsequent step is the dehydration of 1,1-ethylene glycol with an activation barrier of 45.20kcal/mol. In our study, the activation barrier of the first step is 39.87kcal/mol on HZSM-5 catalyst. It indicates that the HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly reduce the activation barrier of the first step. However, the activation barrier of the second step on HZSM-5 catalyst is almost the same to that of thermal cracking. On the one hand, HZSM-5 zeolite can make the rate-determining step change to the intramolecular dehydration reaction. On the other hand, it shows the rationality of the selected calculation model and method. In order to get a better understanding on the reaction process, we further analyze the change of Mulliken charge. From Table 3 , in the first step, Hα obtains electrons and H loses electrons. The charge of Hα increases from original 0.134|e| to 0.514|e|, suggesting Hα obtains electrons during the reactant transforming to the intermediate product. The charge of H decreases from 0.540|e| to 0.352|e|. All of these show the same conclusion: the CO is protonated, and the hydrogen transfer occurs. In the subsequent dehydration reaction, α-hydrogen has becomes the hydrogen proton, locating on the bridge oxygen. The charge of H decreases from 0.377|e| to 0.319|e| and the charge of C1 decreases from 0.625|e| to 0.471|e|, suggesting H and C1 lose electrons. In the process of forming the ketene, the charge of Hα is almost unchanged. It indicates that Hα is not involved in the reaction, so the energy barrier is the same as that of the thermal cracking reaction. 3.3 Protonation of ketene In the reaction of carboxylic acid, many researchers have proposed the existence of acetyl cation detected on the catalytic surface [40]. Moreover, Dooley et al. [43] proposed that the acetyl group is produced by the ketene. On this basis, it is assume that the acetyl cation on the acid catalyst is converted by the ketene. Then, the acetyl cation is further decomposed to CO and the methoxide. As shown in Fig. 5 , the adsorption energy of ketene on zeolite is −17.70kcal/mol. The ketene can be protonated with the distance between C1 and H changing from 1.955Å to 1.109Å, suggesting the formation of the CH bond. The reaction of the first step is very easy to occur with an activation barrier of 3.00kcal/mol. Subsequently, acetyl cation (Int_B_2) can break the CC bond. In the structure of its transition state (TS2-B), CO is formed and the plane-shape structure makes it stable. Meanwhile, the defects, in the framework of HZSM-5, make the distance between C1 and OA decrease from 2.502Å to 1.472Å, and ultimately the methoxide is formed. However, the activation barrier of this step can be as high as 69.30kcal/mol, which shows that the acetyl cation is difficult to be decomposed by the single molecule cracking reaction. Thus, the accumulation of intermediate products consisted of acetyl cation and ketene is more likely to occur, which can be easily detected by the Infrared or other characterizations [44]. It is difficult to obtain the CO by the decomposition of acetyl cation in the catalytic cracking process of the acetic acid. The change of Mulliken charge in the protonation processes of the ketene is shown in Table 4 . It can be seen that the charge of the TS1-B increases to 0.451|e|, suggesting hydrogen proton has a tendency to be separated from the zeolite framework. C1 and C2 obtain electrons, while the charge of O increases from −0.277|e| to −0.147|e|, suggesting the CC double bond is affected by the hydrogen proton. During the subsequent decomposition of acetyl cation, the charge of C1 is changed from −0.328|e| to 0.037|e| of the TS2-B. C1 transfers charge to C2, and the methyl cation in the transition state (TS2-B) is changed into a planar structure with almost no charge. The charge increases when methyl cation is combined with the bridge oxygen to form a methoxide. The positive charge of C2 and C1 indicates the cracking of CC bond. The total charge of C2 and O decreases from 0.400|e| to 0.112|e|, and finally to 0.004|e|, which also confirms the formation of CO. 3.4 Reaction of the ketene and methoxide The reaction characteristics of CO and CC functional groups can be fully reflected by the reaction between the ketene and methoxide. The energy profile is shown in Fig. 6 . The ketene is first adsorbed on the methoxide with the adsorption energy of 14.29kcal/mol. Subsequently, it can combine with the methoxide, and the adsorbed ketene is in parallel with the plane-shaped methyl cation in the transition state (TS1-C). The distance between C1 and C2 decreases to 1.537Å with an activation barrier of 40.08kcal/mol, suggesting the formation of propionyl cation. Under the effect of the unsaturated zeolite framework, the propionyl cation is unstable. The distance between C2 and C3 increases from 1.383Å to 3.825Å, suggesting the cracking of the C-C bond and the formation of CO. Meanwhile, the distance between C2 and OA decreases from 2.787Å to 1.532Å. This indicates that the formation of ethyl cation (Int_C_2) with an activation barrier of 29.78kcal/mol. The decomposition of propionyl cation has a much lower activation barrier than that of acetyl group. So we can predict that the main pathway for the formation of CO is the decomposition of the acyl cation [45], which belongs to the long chain fatty acids (e.g. palm acid). The ethyl alkoxide intermediate (Int_C_3) is unstable that H can be easily transferred to form a bridge hydroxyl group on the zeolite with an activation barrier of 24.81kcal/mol. During the reaction, the distance between H and OA decreases from 2.549Å to 0.982Å. The last step is the inverse process of ethylene protonation which has been studied by many researchers [37,46,47]. The activation barrier of the ethylene protonation calculated by us is 22.81kcal/mol, which compares well with the results of Chu et al. [47] (approximately 21.04kcal/mol). Table 5 shows the distribution of Mulliken charge in the reaction pathway of the ketene and methoxide. During the formation of propionyl cation, the C1 in the transition state (TS1-C) has less charge of −0.060|e|. This is mainly due to the formation of planar-structure methyl cation. The charge of C2 increases from −0.463|e| to −0.412|e|. The larger change of charge is C2, which increases from 0.453|e| to 0.488|e| of the transition state (TS1-C) and eventually becomes 0.634|e|. It shows that the CC bond which is composed of C2 and C3 with large electronegativity is highly unstable. Subsequently, CO is generated with C2 obtaining electrons and C3 losing electrons. The charge of C2 increases from original −0.412|e| to −0.045|e| of the transition state (TS2-C), and it finally changes to 0.070|e|. The charge of C3 increases from original 0.634|e| to 0.293|e| of the transition state (TS2-C), and it finally changes to 0.156|e|. Both of the results suggest that the electrons have transferred from C3 to C2, resulting in the rupture of CC bond. The total charge (i.e., sum of C3 and O) is almost zero, suggesting the formation of CO. In the formation process of ethylene, the charge variation of H is very obvious, which increases from 0.145|e| to 0.397|e|. The charge of C1 and C2 has different degrees of reduction, suggesting the transfer of hydrogen proton in the ethyl alkoxide. During the adsorption process of olefins or the dehydration process of alcohols, the formation of alkoxide intermediate is inevitable [48,49]. Many researchers believe that the surface alkoxide is similar to the nature of carbon ion [50,51]. Because of confinement effect of the zeolite, the interaction between the metheoxide and the bridge oxygen is weak, making it difficult to be observed by experimental methods. But the theoretical calculation shows that the alkoxide on the acidic site of zeolite does exist [52,53]. The experiments [16] show that the catalytic products of acetic acid will contain a certain amount of alcohols and olefins, suggesting that the presence of an alkoxide is possible in the reaction system. In this paper, the methoxide is obtained from the decomposition of the acetyl cation which is formed by the protonation of ketene. The more complex secondary reaction between the intermediate products and the carboxylic acid is interesting, which will be studied in our future work. 4 Conclusions In this work, the reaction mechanism of acetic acid is elucidated by the DFT method on the 46T cluster model of HZSM-5. First of all, the adsorption of acetic acid is investigated. It is found that the most stable adsorption configuration of acetic acid is located in the intersection of the sinusoidal channel and the straight channel with the adsorption energy of −30.84kcal/mol. The results of structural parameters and Mulliken charge show that CO double bond has a tendency to be protonated, and α-hydrogen can be involved in the reaction. The acetic acid is firstly protonated and the α-hydrogen is transferred to form 1,1-ethylene glycol with an activation barrier of 39.87kcal/mol. Subsequently, 1,1- ethylene glycol can be dehydrated to produce the ketene with an activation barrier of 45.23kcal/mol in the second step. In addition to the ketene, the acetyl cation is another intermediate product. As a result, the ketene is very easily protonated to form acetyl cation with an activation barrier of 3.00kcal/mol. When the ketene reacts with the methoxide, propionyl cation can be formed with an activation barrier of 40.08kcal/mol. Propionyl cation is further decomposed to produce CO and ethyl cation with an activation barrier of 29.81kcal/mol. The ethyl cation can produce ethylene and release the hydrogen proton with an activation barrier of 24.81kcal/mol. This step is the inverse process of the ethylene protonation with the similar experimental value of 21.04kcal/mol. The calculated pathways and energetics suggest that the ketene and acetyl cation are two major intermediate products in the catalytic process of acetic acid, and carbon monoxide is produced by the decomposition of acyl cation with long carbon chain.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic cracking of carboxylic acids is regaining great interest in the upgrading of biomass-derived oxygenates. Herein, the catalytic cracking mechanism of acetic acid on HZSM-5 catalyst was studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that acetic acid is firstly protonated, followed by the α-hydrogen transferring to produce 1,1-ethylene glycol, which is subsequently dehydrated to form ketene. The ketene-formation step of this mechanism is found to be the rate-determining step with an activation barrier of 45.23kcal/mol. The as-formed ketene intermediate continues to react with the HZSM-5 catalyst, generating acetyl cation with a small activation barrier of 3.00kcal/mol. Moreover, it is found that the as-formed acetyl cation is difficult to be further decomposed, resulting in the accumulation of intermediate products of acetyl cation and ketene. Meanwhile, the ketene further reacts with methoxide, resulting in the final formation of carbon monoxide and ethylene.",
