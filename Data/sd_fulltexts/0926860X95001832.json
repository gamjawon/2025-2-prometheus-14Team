In the process of production, heating and reduction, the catalyst can often be over-heated. Over-heating or thermal treating of the powder before pelleting as well as the pellets, and thermal shock in the reduction lower the mean horizontal crushing strength and the Weibull modulus, and increase the probability of strength failure by 3 to 10 orders. Absorption of moisture and wetness by water of the pellets, and steam or water shock in the reduction increase this probability by several orders. The mechanical treatment by dropping down the pellets on the floor also lowers the strength. The results in this paper show that properly pelleted and reduced samples possess a very high and reliable strength, for instance, the best reduced sample has a Weibull modulus up to 12.8. The probability of failure of this sample at 10 kg/pellet is as low as 4.16.10 tl. These results show the potentiality in increasing catalyst mechanical strength, and show that due to their brittleness, the catalysts should be properly processed.

Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 oxide catalyst for this process is one of the catalysts that is being produced on the largest scale in the world. The reaction conditions for this catalyst have often been said to be bad as regards the mechanical strength, in such points as, the temperature rise across the bed is normally high; and one of the reactants with a high partial pressure is steam, which has a negative effect on the strength of most of the metal oxides. In some stages of reaction start-up and shut down, the reactor temperature can be lower than the dewpoint. There are often reports of plant shut down due to the failure of the mechanical strength of this catalyst. There are some publications about the mechanical strength of this catalyst. These papers are normally about improving the preparation conditions in order to increase the strength of the catalyst products [ 1-6]. There are also some publications describing the stress state in the pellets and the failure in strength of the catalysts [ 7-9]. There is a lack of convincing literature on the statistics of strength data of the catalysts, which do not follow a normal distribution, and a lack of quantitative comparison and interpretation of the mechanical strength of the working catalysts. Pellets of metal oxide catalysts are normally brittle materials. The failure of this kind of material is often due to brittle fracture. The scattering of the strength data is due to the brittleness of the catalyst materials. For the fracture strength of brittle material, there is the Griffith relation [ 10] or = ( 2Ey/ TrC)1/2 (2) in which E is the Young's modulus of the material, y the surface energy, and C a factor characterizing the size and the state of the flaws existing in the material. The typical flaw size in fracture mechanics is in the range of nm to/zm, which falls into the range of pore size in catalyst pellets. This equation indicates that all the factors in catalyst handling which has effect on E, 3' and C will influence the final mechan- ical strength of the catalyst. Failure of this kind of brittle material can be described by weakest linkage model, which leads to that the strength data obey a Weibull distribution [ 8,11 ] F(00) = 1 - exp( -/30) (3) in which o\" is the maximum tensile stress leading to fracture, F(o-) the probability of failure at stress 00, m the Weibull modulus characterizing the scattering of the strength data, and/3 a factor related to the size of the sample and the normalizing factor of stress. After obtaining the Weibull parameters m and/3 by regression from the horizontal crushing strength (HCS) data, the probability of failure can be calculated by Eq. (3), and hence an estimate of the reliability of the samples at different stress conditions can be derived. In this paper, F5 and Flo are used in the discussion of the mechanical strength. Before the reactor start-up, the catalyst undergoes several processes, such as storing, transportation, loading, heating and reduction. All the conditions in these processes have effects on E, y and the existing state of flaws, and in consequence have effects on the mechanical reliability of the resulting catalyst in the reactor. Y. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 295 Under specific conditions, the mechanical strength can be lost completely. The abnormal conditions often encountered in storing, transportation and loading are clashing, wetting and overtime storing. During heating, reduction and working, the catalyst can undergo over-heating, thermal shock and steam shock, the reactor can be over-saturated, which leads to water shock. In catalyst production, the powder can be over-calcined. All these unsuitable conditions will influence the mechanical strength of the catalyst. The results of process optimization as regards mechanical strength in production and reduction and the discussion on catalyst's mechanical strength in general from this group have been published elsewhere [ 12-17]. This paper will discuss the effect of these unsuitable conditions on the reliability of the mechanical strength of the iron-based HTWGS catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Sample There are two kinds of samples used in the experiment. One is a powder taken directly from industrial production in between the calcination and pelleting proc- esses. It was told by the supplier that the sample contains around 10 wt.-% of Cr203 and 90 wt.-% of Fe203; however, as the calcination temperature in the plant was around 350, the sample could contain volatile components such as water. The sample was produced by a coprecipitation method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of this sample indicates that it contains a major phase of T-Fe203 with a trace amount of ~-Fe203 and T-FeOOH. Another sample was of the same material but in pellets made in the same plant, which had a size of diameter 9 6 mm, a mean HCS of 34.1 kg/pellet with m = 3.42 and/3=4.16.10-6. The powder was pelleted at a pressure of 3 kbar/cm2 in the laboratory with specially designed pelleting equipment, which has been described elsewhere [ 13 ] into pellets with a size of diameter 9 6 mm. The mean HCS of the pellets is 45.8 kg/pellet, with m = 10.1 and/3 = 1.22- 10-17. The pelleting process conditions such as water content etc. were not optimized. The powder was used directly for pelleting with the addition and uniform mixing of 1 wt.-% graphite, and crushing and sieving to pass a sieve of 20 mesh. To ensure that each pellet had the same size for all the experiments the filling weight for the pelleting was decided by the experimental curve of size and filling weight. The samples in the thermal treatment of the powder before pelleting were pelleted under the same conditions after having been exposed to air with nearly the same humidity as in the plant for 24 h. 2.2. Mechanical Strength measurement and data processing The HCS data of the pellets were measured by a MQ-200 pellet strength meter made in Dalian. According to elastic mechanics [18], there is an approximate 296 ELi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 relationship between the maximum loading P in kg and the maximum tensile stress tr inside the pellet leading to fracture in kg/cm2 induced during the measurement of HCSn o\" ~- 2P / 7rdl (4) in which d is the diameter of the pellet in cm and I the length of the pellet in cm. In this case all the pellets have nearly the same size of diameter 9 6 mm. In order to be in consistency with the literature, the maximum loading P and its mean value /~ in kg/pellet have been used in the discussion and statistics of mechanical strength in this paper. The Weibull parameters m and/3 were obtained by the regression between P and F(P). The number of pellets measured for the regression depends on the scattering range of the strength data. More than 50 pellets were measured for the industrially pelleted samples, which were used in the experiment of pellet thermal treating and of abnormal treatment of the pellets. 20 pellets were measured for the samples pelleted in the laboratory, which were used in the experiment of thermal treating of powder and of reduction. 2.3. Experimental conditions An oven with a normal heating and temperature controlling system was employed in thermal treatment of the samples. The word 'high' in the table of results means a high heating and cooling rate, i.e. the sample was loaded into the oven after the temperature reached the expected value and unloaded from the oven at treating temperature and cooled rapidly in air. The word 'low' in the same table means low heating and cooling rate, i.e. the sample was loaded into the oven at room temper- ature and was heated at a normal rate of around 5/min and was cooled naturally with the cooling of the oven. The cooling time is often longer than 4 h. In the experiments of abnormal treatment of pellets in oxidized state, water saturation means that the pellets absorb moisture at 25 in a saturator for 24 h, and were then dried at 110 for 24 h. Water treatment means that the sample was immersed into water at 25 for 30 min, then the pellets were dried at 110 for 24 h. The dropping down experiment indicates that the pellets were dropped down directly on the concrete floor one by one from 1.5 m height. A gradientless reactor CNF-1 made in Lanzhou with internal cycling has been used in the reduction and performance testing experiment with heat and steam/ water shock. The set-up has been described elsewhere [ 14]. The experiment was carried out at atmospheric pressure. The feed composition for reduction and reaction was 25.6 vol.-% of N2, 8.2 vol.-% CO2, 26.7 vol.-% CO and 29.5 H2, with different steam to gas ratio. A total flow of 200 ml/min of dry gas was employed. 20 pellets were used for one experiment. Each experiment took around or more than 15 h including heating, reduction and reaction. The criterion for stopping the experiment was the stableness of the product composition. If the composition of the products of the HTWGS reaction becomes stable in a sense that the variation of the GC Y. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 297 peaks of the major components is less than 3% during one hour, we assumed that the sample reached a stably reduced state and we stopped the experiment. However, the sample could not be reduced completely, to the point of turning Fe203 into Fe304 and turning chromium species into Cr3 completely, which is often said to be the active state of the catalyst. After the experiment the reactor temperature was lowered naturally to room temperature, the catalyst was unloaded carefully and was put into a hermetic bottle before the strength measurement. In the experiment to compare reduction conditions, pellets with the same size and weight were loaded into the reactor at room temperature. With the total flow of the dry gas unchanged, the reactor was heated at a constant rate until the temperature reached 250, then the steam was added at definite steam to gas ratio described in the following table. The reactor was heated at the same rate up to the specified temperature, and afterwards the reduction and reaction were continued until the composition of the products became constant. The heating rate, reduction temperature and steam to gas ratio were different for different experiments. In the experiment of steam and thermal shock in the reduction or/and in the start up stage of the reaction, all the samples were heated in the reactor at a same rate of 4/min. The reduction and reaction temperature were 350 and were the same for all the experiments except the time period for thermal treating. The steam to gas ratio was 0.50 for all the experiments, however, during the time for steam shock, the gas was stopped and the flow rate of the steam was increased to make a total flow equal to the situation with gas. In the table of results, treatm means that, after 8 h of reduction and reaction, the gas was stopped, and with only steam feeding the reactor temperature was lowered to 200, after one hour the state of the reactor was adjusted to the original condition at 350. In treat2, when the temperature reached 200 the gas was stopped and only steam was fed for 1 h. After that the flow was switched to the normal one and the reactor was heated to 350 for further reduction and reaction. In treat3 the reactor was heated directly up to 600, then those conditions were kept for 1 h, after which the temperature was lowered to 350. In treat4 the reactor was heated to 300, the conditions were kept for 2 h, then the temperature was increased to 600 at 5/min; after 1 h the temperature was lowered to 3500C, and the reduction and reaction were stopped. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Thermal treatment of powder before pelleting Table 1 gives the conditions and results of the powder heat treatment experiment. Sample 1 is pelleted in the laboratory by the specially designed pelleting equipment directly using the powder from the industry without any treatment. The strength reliability of this sample is much higher than that of normal industrial samples. The F~o for this sample is as low as 1.53.10-7, and the m is as high as 10.1. Other 298 Y.

The results show that heat treatment of the powder increased the Fro for 104-105 times, and lowered the m considerably. Sample 4 has a Fro as high as 5.96%, which cannot be accepted by industry. The results of these experiments also show that the low heating rate treatment has a stronger effect than a high heating rate. This can be explained by the fact that the heat treatment of the powder changes the physical properties of the small particles such as Young's modulus and surface energy. The lower heating rate means the sample staying at high temperature for a longer time than in the case of higher heating rate, so that the change of physical properties can be more severe. Fig. 1 shows the scattering properties of strength data of these samples correlated with the Weibull distribution. 3.2.

The difference of F~o between these two samples pelleted with different equipment is as much as 105, which means that there is a great potentiality in increasing the mechanical reliability of this catalyst. The data in Table 2 also show that heating of the pellets has a very strong negative effect on the mechanical strength of the catalyst, at the worst condition, which is shown as sample 4 in the table, the F~o is as high as 86.9%. All 5 samples in Table 2 after heat treatment are unacceptable for the industry, which is indicated by the data of F5 and F~o, with the lowest being 16%. The data in Table 2 of pellet treatment also show different trends from those in Table 1 of powder treatment in that in Table 1 all higher heating rate samples at different temperatures show a better strength than those heated at lower rate, while in Table 2 for the pellet treatment, it shows that at 400 a higher heating rate results in a stronger effect on the strength. However, at 500 a lower heating rate has a stronger effect. The difference comes from the fact that in treating a powder only the physical properties of the sample change in the process, but by treating the pellet, due to the evolution of flaws induced by the internal stress resulting from the phase change of iron oxide 3'- Fe203 ~ ot - Fe203 (5) and the dehydration of hydrated oxides such as 2FeOOH ~ Fe203+H20 (6) the flaw size term C in the Griffith Eq. (2) is also changed. In the theory of fracture mechanics, The factor C characterizes the size distribution, the direction of the flaws, and the existing angles between the direction of the flaws and the direction of the tensile stress leading to fracture. The factor C is naturally a constant with many statistical meanings. An XRD experiment in our laboratory confirms the existence of FeOOH in the stored catalyst which was formed due to moisture absorption from the air. The XRD patterns of the samples in Table 2 show clearly the shift of 3,-Fe203 to a-Fe203 with the treating temperature increasing from 400 to 700. The shift from T-Fe203 to a-Fe203 reduces the surface energy, the internal 300 Y. Li et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 stress leads to the growth of the flaws, the loss of-OH groups from the surface weakens the interaction between the particles. The problem of the evolution of the flaws when changing these conditions is very complex because the direction of it often plays a major role for the fracture strength [ 19], so that the trend of strength with temperature can be different in Table 1 and in Table 2. Anyway, in both cases the strength becomes worse as the treating temperature increases, which is clearly shown by the value of F s and Flo. 3.3. Abnormal treatment of the pellets in oxidized state In the process of packing, transporting and loading, the pellets suffer from mechanical stress treatment. A catalyst pellet is a typically brittle material. The clashing of brittle materials leads to surface damage and to the growth of internal flaws, and hence leads to a decrease of mechanical strength. In fact, all the catalysts purchased have some powders and fractured pieces which are formed in different processes due to the effect of mechanical stress encountered when they reach the reactor site. The pellets just formed in the production are normally dry and the particles of the oxides inside the pellets are very small and active, at room temper- ature the potential for the particles to absorb moisture in the air is high, which means that the reaction Fe203 + H20 ~ 2FeOOH (7) can proceed at ambient conditions. The formation of hydrates can lead to internal stress and hence to a change of the flaw distribution, affecting the mechanical strength of the catalyst.Table 3 gives the results of the water saturation experiment, water treatment and drop down of the pellets as a comparison with the original pellets from industry. These treatments very effectively lead to a decrease of strength. The m decreases from 3.42 down to 1.13, and the Flo increases from 1% up to 22%. The results also show that absorbing moisture slowly is even worse than dropping it into water. 3.4. Comparison of the reduction conditions After loading into the reactor, the first process the catalyst undergoes is heating and reduction. After that, the catalyst comes to the stage of stable reaction.

Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 301 the stability of the reaction conditions and the reaction temperature being compar- atively low with respect to the temperature range of plastic deforming of the metal oxides, the mechanical strength of the catalyst should be more stable during the reaction than during the start up process according to fracture mechanics for brittle materials like catalysts. The heating and reduction are unstable processes in which heating leads to expending and thermal stress, phase changes in the reduction of Fe203 to Fe304 lead to chemical stress, shrinking of the pellets due to reduction and evaporation of volatile components lead to mechanical stress. The reaction heat of reduction is large and the temperature is not easy to control, so that sometimes there can be a thermal shock. Due to the presence of steam in the reduction process, there could be steam shock and the reactor temperature could be lower than the dewpoint which leads to water shock. These factors lead us to believe that heating and reduction are among the most important processes for obtaining good mechan- ical performance of the catalyst. In another paper from this group [ 14] a set of optimizing experiments of the process parameters in heating and reduction showed that at good conditions the mechanical strength can be considerably increased, as compared to that of the oxidized state. In contrast, at some conditions also in the range that are industrially often employed, the mechanical strength of the resulting sample can be much lower than in the oxidized state. Table 4 lists the results of heating and reduction at different conditions in com- parison with the original sample in the oxidized state and the sample reduced under optimal conditions. The results in Table 4 show that the reduction process is a major process which decides the final mechanical properties of the catalyst. At optimum conditions the mechanical strength can be substantially increased. As has been shown in the table, sample 3 in the reduced state has a Weibull modulus up to 12.8, much larger than that of sample 1, which is in the oxidized state and is the original sample for the reduction experiments. The F~o of sample 3 is 4 orders lower than that of sample 1. The reduction of the sample at unsuitable conditions lowers the Weibull modulus and increases the probability of failure. Sample 2 was reduced at the same temperature as sample 3, at a higher heating rate than that of sample 3, and with no steam. The Weibull modulus of this sample is only 7.31. The probability of failure of this sample is one order higher than that of sample 1, the original sample in the oxidized state, and is 5 orders higher than that of sample 3, the sample Table 4 Results and statistical properties of the strength data in the experimental set of reduction condition comparison Sample S T R /5 m /3 F5 Fro 1 - - - 45.8 10.1 1.22'10 h7 1.40\"10 to 2 2.00 439 0.00 57.6 7.31 8.86\" 10-~4 1.14\" 10-8 3 1.01 439 1.24 63.0 12.8 6.60.10-24 5.88\" 10-~5 4 2.25 360 0.87 37.6 3.57 1.64- 10 6 5.12\" 10 4 5 4.00 350 0.50 36.4 6.84 1.36\" 10 ~l 8.18\" 10 7 6 4.00 350 5.00 34.8 2.30 2.01 - 10 4 8.10' 10 ~ 1.53\" 10 7 1~80' 10 6 4.16\" 10- ~' 6.06' 10 3 9.37\" 10 5 3.92\" 10 2 302 Y.

Sample 4-6 were reduced at different conditions with variation of the heating rate, reduction temperature and steam to gas ratio. The conditions for these samples were far from the optimum and resulted in much lower m and much higher probability of failure than the original and the optimized sample. The lowest m is 2.30 and the highest F~o is 3.92%. The F~o of this sample is 109 times higher than that of the sample reduced at optimum conditions ! 3.5. The effect of thermal and steam shock during reduction Table 5 gives the results of the experiment with steam and thermal shocks. The data show that steam and thermal shocks in different stages all have strong negative effect on the mechanical strength of the catalyst, nevertheless, the heat shock and steam shock at different stages have different effectiveness on the final strength. In the middle of the reduction stage the steam shock has stronger bad effect on the strength than that of at the beginning of the reduction, which can be derived with the comparison of the data of sample 1 and sample 2, whilst from the comparison of the data of sample 3 and sample 4 a conclusion can be obtained that the thermal shock at the beginning of the reduction has much stronger effect than that at a time period after the reduction started. The results in the experiments of the comparison of reduction conditions and in the experiments with thermal and steam shocks show clearly that the heating and reduction are very important processes for obtaining a good performance of the catalyst. The process factors such as heating rate, reduction temperature and steam to gas ratio are effective to the mechanical strength. It can be concluded that thermal and steam shocks should be avoided during the reduction and reaction in order to get a good mechanical performance of the catalyst. The effectiveness of these factors has been shown with the data in Table 4 and in Table 5, the best sample in these experiments has a Fjo as low as 4.16.10 lJ. In contrast, the worst sample in the same set of experiments has a probability as high as 13.4%. 4. Concluding remarks Due to the brittleness of the catalyst, during the handling of it in production, storing, transportation, loading, heating and reduction, the conditions should be as Y. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 293-304 303 mild as possible in order to avoid any strong stress conditions which can be induced due to mechanical, thermal, and chemical effects of those conditions. The results reported here indicate that there is a great potentiality in increasing the mechanical strength of the catalyst and the 'brittleness' of the catalyst should be considered in every process stage. Due to the complexity of the mechanical strength of the catalyst, it would be worth to do an optimization experiment for all the processes involved in catalyst production and processing. The effectiveness of the factors in these processes on the mechanical strength of the catalyst calls for extensive research on the mechanics of catalyst. 5.

All rights reserved Effect of abnormal treatment on the mechanical strength of iron-based high-temperature shift catalyst Yongdan Li * Rijie Wang Jun Yu Jiyan Zhang Liu Chang Department of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China * Corresponding author. The abnormal conditions encountered by an iron-based high-temperature water-gas shift catalyst in different processing stages and the effect of these conditions on the mechanical strength of the catalyst have been investigated by experimental simulation and Weibull statistics. In the process of production, heating and reduction, the catalyst can often be over-heated. Over-heating or thermal treating of the powder before pelleting as well as the pellets, and thermal shock in the reduction lower the mean horizontal crushing strength and the Weibull modulus, and increase the probability of strength failure by 3 to 10 orders. Absorption of moisture and wetness by water of the pellets, and steam or water shock in the reduction increase this probability by several orders. The mechanical treatment by dropping down the pellets on the floor also lowers the strength. The results in this paper show that properly pelleted and reduced samples possess a very high and reliable strength, for instance, the best reduced sample has a Weibull modulus up to 12.8. The probability of failure of this sample at 10 kg/ pellet is as low as 4.16·10−11. These results show the potentiality in increasing catalyst mechanical strength, and show that due to their brittleness, the catalysts should be properly processed.
