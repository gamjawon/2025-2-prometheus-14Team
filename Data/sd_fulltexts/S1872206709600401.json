DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(09)60040-1 Deuterium Inverse Isotopic Effect in Ammonia Synthesis over Ru-Based and Fe-Based Catalysts LIN Jingdong*, LIAO Daiwei # , ZHANG Hongbin, WAN Huilin, TSAI Khirui National Engineering Laboratory for Green Chemical Productions of Alcohols-Ethers-Esters, State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, China Abstract: The deuterium inverse isotopic effect (DIIE) is important for the clarification of the ammonia synthesis mechanism over transi- tion metal catalysts. We investigated the DIIE over Ru-based and Fe-based catalysts including pure Fe, multi-promoted fused Fe, pure Ru, Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 , K-Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 , Ru/MgO, K-Ru/MgO, and Ba-Ru/MgO under the reaction conditions of N 2 /H 2 (or D 2 ) volume ratio = 1/3, 0.2 MPa, 633–733 K, and GHSV = 24 000 and 12 000 h −1 . A strong DIIE (r D /r H of about 2) was observed over the above catalysts. The trend of the DIIE with catalysts and temperature indicated a strong competition between the dynamic and thermodynamic factors. Key words: ammonia synthesis; deuterium inverse isotopic effect; Ru-based catalysts; Fe-based catalysts; hydrogen-assisted dissociation; disso- ciative mechanism; associative mechanism The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrogen into ammonia, N 2 + 3H 2 → 2NH 3 , is a simple reaction without any byproduct. Research achievements in both experiment and theory on this catalytic process in the past hundred years have greatly pro- moted development in heterogeneous catalysis and related fields such as surface science [1]. However, there are still different opinions on the catalytic mechanism, whether it is the dissociative mechanism or associative mechanism [2,3]. In the dissociative mechanism, the dissociative chemisorp- tion of molecular nitrogen (N 2 → 2N ad ) is the rate-determining step (RDS). This means that hydrogen is not involved in the RDS. Therefore, the deuterium inverse isotopic effect (DIIE) was explained by the thermodynamic reason that the reaction equilibrium constants are different for the hydrogenation and deuteration of the most abundant species chemisorbed on the catalysts [4]. However, in the associative mechanism, hydro- gen-assisted dissociation of chemisorbed molecular nitrogen (N 2 H ad → N ad + NH ad or N 2 H 2ad → 2NH ad ) is the RDS. This means that hydrogen is involved in the RDS. In this case, the dynamic reason of a different reaction energy barrier due to the different zero point energies of the adsorbed hydrogen-species and deuterium-species was used to explain the DIIE. The DIIE in ammonia synthesis over a doubly-promoted iron catalyst was reported first by Ozaki and co-workers [4] in 1960. It is an important experimental evidence for the ammonia synthesis mechanism over transition metal catalysts, and in the past 50 years, both experimental and theoretical research on the DIIE over Fe-based catalysts, Ru-based catalysts, and other transition-metal catalysts has been continuously reported [5–13]. Unfortunately, the results and explanations were in- conclusive. Therefore, a new systematic experimental re-examination of the DIIE is necessary. In this study, the precursor of Fe was Fe 2 O 3 (99.999%) sup- plied by STREM Chemicals. The multi-promoted fused Fe (commercial A110-3) catalyst was supplied by Fuzhou Uni- versity and was composed of 68%–70% Fe, 1.8%–2.4% Al 2 O 3 , 1.2%–1.6% CaO, and 0.5%–0.7% K 2 O. The Ru catalyst was Ru powder of 99.9% and 200 mesh supplied by Acros Com- pany. The Ru/MgO and Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst precursors were pre- LIN Jingdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 153–155 pared by impregnation, using MgO obtained by calcining basic magnesium carbonate at 973 K for 5 h or γ-Al 2 O 3 supplied by Alfa Aesar. RuCl 3 ·nH 2 O (37% Ru, Heraeus Materials Tech- nology Shanghai Ltd.), acetone (100 ml), and MgO or γ-Al 2 O 3 support (Ru/support mass ratio of 4/100) were mixed for 6 h, evaporated to dryness, and calcined at 383 K overnight to obtain the precursor. The precursors of K-Ru/MgO and K-Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 were prepared by impregnation. The above precursor of Ru/MgO or Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 was reduced by N 2 /H 2 (volume ratio = 1/3) at 723 K for 6 h, followed by impregnation with 50% ethanol aqueous solution at a K/Ru ratio of 4/1 and room temperature for 4 h, evaporating to dryness and drying at 383 K overnight to obtain the precursor. The precursor of Ba-Ru/MgO was prepared by impregnation. Ru/MgO was prepared by above same treatment, followed by impregnation with 50% ethanol aqueous solution at a Ba/Ru ratio of 1/1 and room temperature for 4 h, evaporating to dryness and calcining at 383 K overnight to obtain the precursor. The ammonia synthesis activity of the catalysts was evalu- ated over 0.2 or 0.4 ml of catalyst powder in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. Before entering the catalyst bed, the reactant gases (N 2 /H 2 volume ratio = 1/3, 99.999%, supplied by Linde Com- pany or N 2 /D 2 volume ratio = 1/3, 99.50%, supplied by the 718 Institute of CSIC) were passed through a HON-HG-V- M0.3/1.0 high purity gas purification unit (Dalian Samat Chemicals Co. Ltd) to remove traces of oxygen and water. All catalysts were activated by a N 2 /H 2 flow (volume ratio = 1/3) of 30 ml/min under atmospheric pressure using a programmed temperature increase. The reactant gas (0.2 MPa, GHSV = 24 000 or 12 000 h −1 ) was switched into the reactor after the activation of catalyst was completed. When the activity reached the steady state, the amount of ammonia, NH 3 and ND 3 , produced at different reaction temperatures (633–733 K) were determined by a chemical titration method and denoted r H and r D (ml/(g·h)), respectively. The ratio r D /r H under the same reaction conditions was the DIIE value. We carried out the evaluation of the DIIE values in ammonia synthesis over all the Fe-based catalysts and Ru-based catalysts prepared above. The results are listed in Table 1. A strong DIIE, r D /r H ≈ 2, was observed for all the catalysts. The values of r D /r H were dependent on the reaction temperatures. Two different opinions, namely, the thermodynamic effect and dynamic effect, have been proposed to explain the DIIE in ammonia synthesis. In order to be in accord with the dissocia- tive mechanism of ammonia synthesis, Ozaki and co-workers [4,5] suggested that the most abundant chemisorbed species was N ad on unpromoted, singly-promoted, and doubly-pro- moted (at high temperature) iron catalysts, and NH ad on dou- bly-promoted iron catalyst, and explained the DIIE by the thermodynamic reason of a difference in the equilibrium con- stants for the hydrogenation and deuteration reactions. In the second explanation based on the associative mecha- nism, Tsai et al. [10] proposed that the DIIE was due to the dynamic reason of a difference in the zero point energies. This was similar to the successful explanation of the DIIE in the hydrogenation of ethene at low temperature by Kokes [14]. It is to be noted that the ethene was not dissociated. Tsai et al. [10] also suggested that the DIIE over iron catalysts for ammonia synthesis may be due to a combination of the dynamic effect and thermodynamic effect. Using the associative mechanism, Huang [11] deduced a rate equation similar to the Tem- kin-Pizhev equation, and then by using a calculation performed with the experimental kinetic data reported by Ozaki and co-workers [4], he explained the DIIE as due to a combined effect of both the dynamic and thermodynamic factors. Liao [12,13] also deduced similar rate equations based on the asso- ciative route and used experimental molecular spectroscopic data [10,15] to explain the DIIE in ammonia synthesis by the dynamic reason of a zero point energy difference. For the thermodynamic explanation to work, an atomic ni- trogen adspecies has to be the most abundant adsorbed species. However, this may be not true. In situ FT-IR and laser Raman spectroscopy studies showed that the dominant chemisorbed species under reaction conditions was molecular nitrogen [12,15,16]. Takezawa [8] indicated that only L-type chemi- sorbed nitrogen, which would be undissociated dinitrogen, can exhibit the DIIE, but H-type chemisorbed nitrogen, which would be dissociated nitrogen, only exhibited the normal deu- terium isotopic effect. Vibrational signals in the range of 2 268–1 910 cm −1 that were assigned to the dinitrogen chemi- sorbed species on the Fe-based catalysts and Ru-based cata- lysts were observed in our experiments [10,12,15–17]. This experimental finding supported the argument that the most abundant adsorbed species was IR and Raman active dinitro- gen adspecies, and these chemisorbed dinitrogen species were activated to react directly with hydrogen to ammonia. There- fore, the dynamic reason invoking the hydrogenation of mo- lecular nitrogen adspecies would be the explanation of the DIIE.

LIN Jingdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 153–155 A statistical expression for the dynamic isotopic effect can be deduced from the transition state theory and statistical me- chanics. The expression can be approximated by a simple expression by including only one term of the zero point energy. When this is treated as a first order isotopic effect of hydrogen, we can write the expression as k D /k H = exp{(1.4388/T)[(ω FeD − ω FeH ) − (ω ND − ω NH )]}. By substitution with the bond vibration frequences (ω) of the transition state and temperature (T), we can calculate that the ratio of rate constants, k D /k H , is 2.03 for the transition states of H 2 N 2 /Fe and D 2 N 2 /Fe. This is in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.07 in Table 1. We can also calculate the value of 1.42 for the transition state of HN 2 /Fe and DN 2 /Fe at 673 K over the multi-promoted iron catalyst [13]. According to the above approximate expression, the values of the dynamic isotopic effect change with both the vibrational frequencies of the transition state and the temperature. Our experimental results also showed the change of the r D /r H values with increased temperatures. The trend change indicated a strong competition between the dynamic isotopic effect and thermodynamic isotopic effect, which was influenced by both catalyst and reaction conditions. The infrared-active dinitrogen adspecies, for example, was observed at 2 170–2 150 cm −1 over MgO but not over Al 2 O 3 [18]. This indicated that the MgO support gave the adsorption and activation of molecular ni- trogen, but this was not the case with Al 2 O 3 . Therefore, the extent of the competition between the dynamic factor and thermodynamic factor over MgO-supported catalysts and Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts would be different. In conclusion, strong deuterium inverse isotopic effects, r D /r H of about 2, were observed over both Ru-based and Fe-based catalysts. This was explained as due to a strong competition between the dynamic isotopic effect and thermo- dynamic isotopic effect. This was a reliable and important experimental evidence that hydrogen was involved in the rate determining step. This result supported the associative mecha- nism of ammonia synthesis, in which the associative route was the major pathway, the dissociative route was the minor pathway, and the two routes strongly competed with each other.
