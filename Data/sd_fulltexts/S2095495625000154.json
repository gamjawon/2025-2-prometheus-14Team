Graphical abstract A weakly solvated electrolyte is proposed through the solvents with lower HOMO energy level and LiDFOB (high binding energy) salt to form a thin and inorganic-enriched CEI layer for stable nickel-rich cathode at high temperature. High-nickel cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) could enable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, excessive decomposition of the electrolyte would happen in the high operating voltage range. In addition, the utilization of flammable organic solvents would increase safety risks in the high temperature environment. Herein, an electrolyte consisting of flame-retardant solvents with lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and LiDFOB salt is proposed to address above two issues. As a result, a thin and robust cathode-electrolyte interface containing rich LiF and Li-B-O compounds is formed on the cathode to effectively suppress electrolyte decomposition in the high operating voltage. The NCM811||Li cell paired with this designed electrolyte possesses a capacity retention of 72% after 300 cycles at 55 ℃. This work provides insights into developing electrolyte for stable high-nickel cathode operated in the high temperature. Keywords Electrolyte engineering Weak solvation High temperature Safety High-nickel cathode 1 Introduction Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have achieved great success in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles (EVs) because of the high energy density and long service life [1–4]. To relieve the mileage anxiety EVs, LIBs with a higher energy density is pursued by exploring high-energy cathode materials [5–7]. Among masses of cathode materials, high-nickel cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is regarded as a promising candidate to meet the demand [8,9]. However, the NCM811 suffers from severe capacity degradation during charge/discharge process due to the unstable structure and electrode/electrolyte interface (CEI), especially in the high-voltage [10–14]. The absence of stable CEI could aggravate the decomposition of electrolyte and degradation of materials, leading to the generation of the combustible gas. Besides, the NCM811 tends to release more heat during the operation, which could further trigger thermal runaway [15–19]. To enhance the cycling stability of the cathode, some strategies have been adopted, such as surface coating, element doping, and electrolyte modification [20–25]. As electrolyte modification strategy, the generation of stable CEI is fatal for the electrochemical performance of cathode. For instance, film-forming additives are employed into the electrolyte to generate a stable interface [26–31]. Besides, mixed-salt electrolytes are used to create stable interface consisting of multiple components [32,33]. Additionally, the concentration of electrolytes is raised to improve the stability of the Ni-rich cathodes by the formation of robust CEI [34–36]. Nonetheless, it is still worth exploring some other kinds of approaches for generating stable interface. The role of solvation structure on the cathode interfacial chemistry has been uncovered [37,38]. It was reported that weakly solvating electrolytes, in which containing a large number of contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) rather than solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs), can favorably generate anion-derived interface. However, some solvents of weakly solvating electrolytes are highly flammable, which could increase safety risks in the operation of battery, especially for Ni-rich cathodes under the high temperature condition. Herein, a nonflammable electrolyte is proposed to match with NCM811 cathode that is operated under the high temperature. LiDFOB is dissolved in a mixture of flame-retardant and low HOMO-level triethyl phosphate (TEP) and ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) to form an electrolyte with a weakly-solvation structure. Owing to the unique solvation structure, a dense LiF/Li-B-O rich CEI layer is formed on the surface of NCM811 due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB, leading to the improvement of electrochemical and safety performance at the high temperature. As a result, the NCM811||Li cell with this designed electrolyte shows an improved capacity retention of 72% after 300 cycles at 55 ℃. We believe that this work can offer prospects into the development of nonflammable electrolyte for NCM811 cathode under high temperature. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Solvation structure The capacity decay of NCM811 cathode at the high temperature can be accelerated by the unstable CEI derived from electrolytes. Thus, it is significant to ensure the stability of CEI interface and electrolyte at the high temperature. To achieve stable and safe cycling of the NCM811 cathode at high temperature, an electrolyte with weak-solvation structure is tailored by employing poorly soluble salts and lower HOMO level flame-retardant solvents (Fig. 1 a). Specifically, the LiDFOB is dissolved in a mixture of flame-retardant and low HOMO-level triethyl phosphate (TEP) and ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) to form an electrolyte (abbreviated as DTP) with a weak-solvation structure. This approach could collectively construct a stable inorganic-rich CEI interface on the surface of NCM811 and enhance its safety performance. Besides of DTP as the electrolyte for NCM811 cathode, commercial electrolyte, i.e., 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (3:7 in vol.%) with additional 2 vol.% vinylene carbonates, abbreviated as ST, was selected for comparison. The density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to calculate the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of corresponding solvents and salts, as shown in Fig. 1b. It shows that the HOMO energy levels of the TEP (−7.95 eV), PFPN (−10.4 eV) are evidently lower than that of LiDFOB (−7.1 eV), indicating that the salt anion is more preferentially oxidized on the cathode surface than solvents. The binding energies between different anions and cations were calculated by DFT in Fig. 1c [39]. Compared with frequently-used lithium salts, DFOB− has the strongest binding energy with Li+, which means it has the weakest interaction with solvents. Therefore, LiDFOB is selected as corresponding salt to design electrolyte featuring weak solvation due to its low dissociation ability, even when paired with strong-solvation TEP. In order to investigate the solvation structure of DTP electrolyte, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to reveal the solvation structure of Li+ in the electrolytes (Fig. 1d). Consequently, 60% of Li+ ions are involved in the form of contact ion pairs (CIPs) with a structure of [Li-TEP1PFPN2]+[DFOB]−, while leftover 40% of Li+ ions are coordinated to form aggregates (AGGs) with a structure of [2Li-TEP2PFPN2]2+[2DFOB]2−. The solvation structures in forms of CIPs and AGGs mean the absence of FEC in solvation. Besides, it is also confirmed by the Li+ radial distribution functions (RDFs) and the coordination number (CN) in Fig. 1e. The average coordination number (CN) of TEP, PFPN, FEC and DFOB− with per Li+ cation is 1.35, 1.10, 0.05 and 1.65 in average, respectively. Clearly, Li+ cations are coordinated with TEP, PFPN, and DFOB− as the primary solvation shell in the absence of FEC molecules, indicating the weak solvation feature of DTP electrolyte. Then, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed to further uncover solvation structure in DTP system. Downfield shifts of all 1H nuclei of TEP are observed in DTP electrolyte after LiDFOB is added into the blended TEP-PFPN solutions, originating from the shielding effect of cations (Fig. 1f). The 1H NMR results of TEP in DTP electrolyte display that the TEP molecule interacts with Li+ cations in this solvation structure. 19F NMR spectra were analyzed to further study the chemical environment of anions and solvents. The single peak located at −123.6 cm−1 is slightly deviated from free-state of DFOB− (−122 cm−1), as shown in Fig. 1g. This observation unequivocally indicates the involvement of DFOB− into primary solvation sheath. The existence of additionally shifted peaks from PFPN in DTP electrolyte is due to the dipole-dipole interaction between TEP and PFPN. To prove the existence of dipole-dipole interaction between TEP and PFPN, two-dimensional 1H−1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) is applied (Fig. S1). It further elucidates that the cross peak at (1.31, 1.40) originating from the coupling of the ethyl proton in TEP and PFPN. This intermolecular interaction is directional and stable because of no additional coupling of the PFPN with other cyclic protons (such as FEC). The 1H−1H COSY result demonstrates the existence of dipole-dipole interaction between TEP and PFPN, leading to the shift of PFPN in DTP towards upfield, and also eliminates the influence of FEC in this directional dipole-dipole interaction. The solvation type of Li+ ions in DTP electrolyte was further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S2). The peak at 707 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration in the free DFOB− anions. Additional two fitting peaks are discovered at 714 and 718 cm−1 for DTP electrolytes, indicating that contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) solvation structure are formed in this designed electrolyte [40]. The higher proportion of CIPs and AGGs solvation structure demonstrates the weakly solvated feature in DTP electrolyte. Both NMR and Raman results confirm that the introduction of salts having high binding energy between the cation and anion is conducive to formation of CIPs/AGGs-dominated solvation structures. 2.2 Physical and chemical properties The lower HOMO energy levels of solvents are beneficial to preventing them from excessive decomposition, especially in high temperature [23]. As a result, it well broadens the onset oxidation potential to 4.94 V vs. Li+/Li in DTP, while it is prominently oxidized at voltage beyond 4.13 V for ST electrolyte (Fig. 2 a). These results well agree with the HOMO level calculation by DFT, which shows the improved electrochemical stability of DTP electrolyte. This recipe of electrolyte also has great impact on the physicochemical properties of the electrolyte. The viscosities and ionic conductivities of DTP at different temperatures have been collected as shown in Fig. 2b. The electrolyte viscosities are 4.10 cP at 25 °C and 2.5 cP at 55 °C, while the ionic conductivity of the DTP electrolyte is 2.2 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and remains 3.5 mS cm−1 even at 55 °C. Apart from its basic properties, desirable thermal stability should be another critical factor for developing high-temperature LIBs. As displayed in Fig. 2c, both ST and DTP electrolytes exhibit transparent features under 25 °C at fresh-state and long-time storage. When it transfers into a high-temperature environment, obvious color and pH change are discovered in ST electrolyte, i.e., from transparent/neutral to brown/acidic, signifying the thermal instability of the ST electrolyte at high temperature. Due to the high stability of solvents and LiDFOB salt, the DTP electrolyte preserves initial state after storage at 55 °C for 50 h. The permeation of electrolyte in the separator affects Li-ion migration and electrochemical performance [41–43]. As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S3, the contact angle between ST electrolyte and PP-Al2O3 separator is 15.5°, while it is reduced to 6.1° for DTP electrolyte, indicating excellent wettability of DTP electrolyte. Therefore, it can guarantee Li-ion flux with continuous pathways and a positive impact on electrochemical performance. The higher oxidation potential, thermal stability, excellent wettability, suitable ionic conductivity and viscosity of DTP electrolyte can well meet the demand for the battery operation. 2.3 Performance of NCM811 cathode at 25 and 55 °C The compatibility of DTP electrolyte with NCM811 is evaluated at 25 and 55 °C (Fig. 3 ). The NCM811 with ST electrolyte delivers an initial capacity of 194.0 mA h g−1, which is notably decreased to 170.0 mA h g−1 for the 100th cycle. In contrast, it still maintains a high specific capacity of 196.5 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle in DTP electrolyte. Additionally, the polarization voltage of charging/discharging curves for NCM811 with DTP electrolyte is much smaller than that in ST electrolyte (Fig. 3a, b). Fig. S4a, b display the charge-discharge curves of NCM811 in DTP and ST electrolytes at different rates. At a low current density of 0.2 C, similar specific capacity is observed in NCM811 with DTP and ST electrolytes. However, the capacity of NCM811 in DTP electrolyte is inferior to that in ST electrolyte as the rate increases. It is possibly attributed to the high viscosity and relatively low ionic conductivity of DTP electrolyte. As the cycling times prolong, the NCM811||Li cell maintains a high-capacity retention of 91% and stable output voltage after 300 cycles in DTP electrolyte at 25 °C (Fig. 3c), which is superior to that in ST electrolyte. The similar trend has also been presented in view of the capacity retention at 55 °C (Fig. 3d). NCM811 cycled with DTP electrolyte possesses a capacity retention of 72% after 300 cycles, while NCM811 cycled with ST electrolyte only has a capacity retention of 57% after 170 cycles. Besides, cell in DTP exhibits a higher Coulombic efficiency (CE) than that in ST electrolyte at 55 °C (Fig. 3e). Besides, the electrochemical performance of NCM811 cathode with DTP1 electrolyte is measured, which is slightly lower than that in DTP electrolyte (Fig. S5). Fig. 3f and Fig. S6 depict the differential capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV) curves of NCM811||Li cells of the ST and DTP electrolytes. The four main redox peaks observed during cycling are attributed to the phase transitions of the hexagonal (H1) ⇄ monoclinic (M) ⇄ hexagonal (H2) ⇄ hexagonal (H3) of the NCM811 cathode (Fig. 3f) [44–46]. The DTP electrolyte exhibits more smaller shifts in these phase transition peaks, indicating higher reversibility of the cathode. Charge/discharge polarization also increases with cycling, with the DTP cell demonstrating lower polarization, particularly during the H2 to H3 phase transition. The redox peaks around 4.2 V, corresponding to the H2→H3 phase transition, are associated with rapid capacity fading. This phase transition causes a sudden contraction of the NCM cell in the c-direction, leading to large micro-strain and a subsequent decline in rechargeability. The H2→H3 transition peak is completely disappeared in the cell with the ST electrolyte at the 100th cycle (Fig. S6), whereas it remains relatively well-preserved in the DTP electrolyte. The CE and dQ/dV results demonstrate that reversibility and structural integrity of the cathode are well preserved in DTP electrolyte. Furthermore, we also try DTP electrolyte on the LiCoO2/Li cells with the upper cut-off voltage 4.6 V. It is observed that LiCoO2/Li cells show a remarkable capacity retention of 74% after 200 cycles at 25 °C (Fig. S7). Thus, the tailored DTP electrolyte could be universally applicable for cathode with high operating potential. 2.4 Interfacial chemistry To investigate the effect of different electrolytes on the high-temperature performance, scanning electron microscope (SEM) was applied to further analyze the cycled cathodes (Fig. 4 a, b, Figs. S8 and S9). The NCM811 cathode cycled in ST electrolyte tend to experience significant aggravation of microcrack formation, leading to particle breakage and substantial damage to the electrochemical performance. Whereas, the cycled cathode particles in DTP electrolyte are more integrated without obvious particle fracture. It demonstrates that the structural evolution of the cathodes during cycling is dependent on the electrolyte and dramatic structural changes during cycling is significantly suppressed in DTP electrolyte. The formation of microcracks is closely related to the composition and distribution of the CEI [47,48]. Therefore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to study the interfacial chemistry of cycled NCM811 cathode. From the results of C 1s spectra, it can be deduced from Fig. 4c that organic-groups (H–C–O, C–O–C, C=O in ROLi and ROCO2Li) in the CEI both appear in ST and DTP electrolytes. Compared with the CEI in ST electrolyte, the CEI in DTP electrolyte possesses a lower ratio of organic groups content by using the areal strength of conductive carbon (C–C) as a reference point in the ST and DTP electrolytes. The result suggests that less organic substance is formed on the surface of NCM811 in the DTP electrolyte compared to that in the ST electrolyte, which is also confirmed by O 1s results (Fig. S10). Additionally, the O=P signal located at 532.7 eV belongs to the decomposition of PFPN molecule. Specifically, stronger signals of LiF and Li–B–O are detected on the NCM811 cathode with DTP electrolyte than that in ST electrolyte (Fig. 4d and Fig. S11). These inorganic species are associated with the preferential decomposition of anions (DFOB−) in DTP electrolyte where CIPs/AGGs solvation structure is dominated. Besides, the formation of P=N rich interface after the decomposition of PFPN could further stabilize the electrode (Fig. 4e and Fig. S12). Furthermore, a strong Co 2p signal from bulk material suggests the formation of a thin CEI layer on the surface of NCM811with DTP electrolyte (Fig. S13). In summary, a thin and inorganic-rich CEI interface containing substantial LiF and Li-B-O is formed on NCM811with DTP electrolyte, which works as a stable protective layer to maintain structural stability of the cathode. Meanwhile, the XPS results of the interfacial chemistry of LCO cycled with DTP electrolyte also demonstrate the formation of an inorganic-rich CEI interface enriched with LiF on the LCO cathode (Fig. S14). The leaching of transition metals (Ni, Mn, and Co) from cathode material into electrolyte could emerge during the cycling. Then these metals could be redeposited on the anode. This dissolution-redeposition process can cause injury on the cathode, ultimately compromising the overall performance of the battery. Thus, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was conducted to further demonstrate the protective function of CEI on NCM811 cathode with DTP electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4f, the dissolution of transition metal ions has been well suppressed by DTP electrolyte, and the concentration of corresponding ions in the DTP electrolyte is at least an order of magnitude lower than that in the ST electrolyte. HRTEM images clearly depict the variation in thickness of the CEI layer (Fig. 4g, h). The CEI layer in ST electrolyte is uneven and thick after 50 cycles (Fig. 4g), which is ascribed to severe decomposition of electrolyte and dissolution of transition metal accompanying with high nickel catalysis under the high voltage. It is noted that a thin CEI layer is generated on the surface of NCM particles in DTP electrolyte (Fig. 4h) and the thickness is around 5.03 nm. Moreover, the NCM811 particles in DTP electrolyte still had a uniform CEI film after 100 cycles (Fig. S15). In summary, the DTP electrolyte with CIPs/AGGs-dominated solvation structures can produce a robust and compact CEI that mitigates solvent decomposition and stabilizes the surface structure of NCM811, thereby improving the electrochemical performance (Fig. 4i). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to investigate the evolution of interfacial property, as shown in Fig. S16a, b. It can be seen that all Nyquist curves are semicircles in the high-frequency range and sloping straight lines in the low-frequency range. A semicircle shown in the high-frequency region corresponds to the interfacial film impedance (R SEI + R ct). The EIS fitting results of equivalent circuits are shown in Fig. S16c. The electrochemical impedance in DTP electrolyte maintains stable after the 10th cycle, which is on account that the stable CEI prevents electrolyte from further decomposition during cycling. In sharp contrast, the electrochemical impedance in ST electrolyte displays a fast rise with the increase of cycles. It is speculated that a thick organic-rich CEI formed in ST. It slows down the ion diffusion on the cathode interface. 2.5 Thermochemical property The electrolyte is often identified as the most vulnerable component to heat generation due to its flammability and high electrochemical reduction activity during deep delithiation. This susceptibility can lead to intense exothermic reactions and potential thermal runaway, necessitating a thorough investigation into the thermal properties of electrolytes to assess safety concerns. To evaluate these properties, ignition testing was conducted as depicted in Fig. 5 a, b. In stark contrast, the glass fiber matrix loaded with ST electrolyte exhibited a propensity to ignite easily and propagate rapidly, while DTP electrolyte consistently demonstrated superior self-extinguishing properties by extending ignition times. Furthermore, the limiting oxygen index (LOI), which indicates the minimum concentration of oxygen required to sustain the combustion of an electrolyte, was measured to qualitatively assess oxygen consumption. DTP electrolyte exhibited a significantly higher LOI of 27.3 compared to ST, indicating its outstanding nonflammability (Fig. 5c). Notably, the addition of FEC to DTP electrolyte did not enhance the LOI value. Additional key thermal characteristics were systematically studied by using a cone calorimeter (Fig. 5d, e and Fig. S17). DTP electrolyte displayed a time to ignition of 22.3 s and a self-extinguishing time of 12.1 s g−1, affirming its inherent resistance to ignition and ease of extinguishment, thus classifying it as a nonflammable electrolyte. In contrast, ST electrolyte was observed to be prone to ignition and challenging to extinguish. Regarding heat generation, DTP electrolyte exhibited lower total heat release (THR) at 4.90 kJ g−1 compared to 9.9 kJ g−1 in ST electrolyte, along with a lower maximum heat release rate (88.13 W g−1 vs. 156.7 W g−1). These results underscore the significant thermal safety potential of DTP electrolyte for practical applications. Apart from the inherent safety features of the electrolyte, consideration must be taken to the exothermic reactions between the electrolyte and electrode material for further evaluation. We utilized differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to assess the thermal-abuse tolerance of the electrolyte when paired with a charge-state NCM811 electrode. A notable difference was observed around 180 °C, where NCM811 mixed with ST electrolyte exhibited an onset temperature (T onset) of 153 °C (Fig. 5f). Additionally, the exothermic peak commenced at 187 °C due to the reaction with oxidized NCM811. Furthermore, the onset of the first exothermic peak was delayed by approximately 22 °C (224 vs. 202 °C) with a normalized total heat release of 1.6 kJ g−1 in the DTP electrolyte, indicating a significant suppression of thermal reactions in the DTP electrolyte. In short, this flame-retardant DTP electrolyte could well address the safety concerns associated with NCM811 cathodes. Finally, the puncture experiment of NCM811|DTP|Li pouch cell further demonstrated the thermal safety under extreme condition (Fig. S18). 3 Conclusions A nonflammable electrolyte with weak-solvation structure is tailored by employing nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO level and LiDFOB salt with low dissociation energy. Due to the unique solvation structure in the electrolyte, a robust CEI consisting of rich LiF and Li-B-O compounds is formed on the cathode to effectively suppress the decomposition of electrolyte and improve the cycling stability of NCM811 in the high operating voltage. Additionally, the flame-retardant property of electrolyte could endow NCM811 with outstanding performance at the high temperature. A capacity retention of 72% could be obtained by NCM811||Li cell with this designed electrolyte after 300 cycles at 55 ℃. This work broadens the vision for the development of NCM811 operated at the high temperature conditions from the perspective of nonflammable electrolyte with weak-solvation structure.

        "dc:description": "High-nickel cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) could enable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, excessive decomposition of the electrolyte would happen in the high operating voltage range. In addition, the utilization of flammable organic solvents would increase safety risks in the high temperature environment. Herein, an electrolyte consisting of flame-retardant solvents with lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and LiDFOB salt is proposed to address above two issues. As a result, a thin and robust cathode-electrolyte interface containing rich LiF and Li-B-O compounds is formed on the cathode to effectively suppress electrolyte decomposition in the high operating voltage. The NCM811||Li cell paired with this designed electrolyte possesses a capacity retention of 72% after 300 cycles at 55 ℃. This work provides insights into developing electrolyte for stable high-nickel cathode operated in the high temperature.",
