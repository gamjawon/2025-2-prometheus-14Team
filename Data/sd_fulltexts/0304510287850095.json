RYBAK* and J^ZEF J. ZIOLKOWSKI Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw, 50-383 Wroctaw (Poland) (Received January 16, 1987; accepted June 8, 1987) The important role of transition metal complexes containing hard Tr-donor ligands, e.g. chloro, oxo [1] or nitrodo, imido and amido [2] in catalytic reactions, was recently emphasized. These ligands can stabilize the higher oxidation states and allow the formation of organometallic compounds [3]. The organometallic oxo compounds are most interesting from the point of view of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis [4]. They can act as precatalysts in metathesis reactions of unsaturated hydro- carbons. This applies also to heterogeneous rhenium oxide catalysts active in metathesis of functionalized olefins [5]. These ascertainments related to oxo ligand have been confirmed experimentally by the fact that some catalytic systems could be activated by oxygen-containing compounds such as 0; and H20, or by alcohols [6]. Although the alkylidene-metalla- cycio butane mechanism of olefin metathesis is well recognized [7], the structure of the catalyst precursor and its transformation in catalytic reac- tion require further study. For a better understanding of the role of oxo complexes in olefin metathesis reaction, we have examined the following Re(III) compounds: ReCl3(PMePh2)3 [8], ReCla^OE^L [9], ReClapys [10]** and related Re(V) oxo complexes: ReOCl3(PPh3)2 [II], ReOCla^OE^], [12] and ReOClapys [13] as precatalysts in metathesis reaction [14]. Catalytic activity of these complexes was tested in the model metathesis reaction of pent-2-ene (eqn. (1)) carried out in chlorobenzene with the contribution [ReLAlClzEt pent-2-ene hex-3-ene + but-2-ene (1) PhCl; 20 C *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. ** Alternatively, ReC^pys may also be obtained via a convenient and high yield procedure: ReOClapy; (1.0 g, 2.14 mmol) and PPha (0.7 g, 2.67 mmol, 25% excess) were refluxed in dry pyridine under Ar for 5 h. The resultant reddish-brown solution was evaporated under vacuum to dryness. The solid was recrystallized from dichloro- methane ethyl ether solution, yielding the desired ReClspys (yield ca. 80%). 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 348 TABLE 1 The catalytic activity of rhenium complexes in the metathesis reaction of pent-2-ene Re complex Initial rate1' Note (turnover min\"1) ReCl3py3.

The results are presented in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the Re(III) complexes containing no oxo ligands show no catalytic activity in reaction (1). On the contrary, the Re(V) oxo complexes afford the active forms of a catalyst. Re(III) complexes with phosphorus ligands, when treated with dioxygen in solution, became the catalyst precursor. The catalytic activity of such prepared catalysts strongly depends upon the kind of complex, its reaction duration with dioxygen, and is poorly reproducible. These observations can be explained by the formation of active rhenium(V) complexes [15] in reaction with dioxygen (eqn.(2)): ReCl3P3 + 02 ^ ReOCl3P2 + OP (2) Rhenium(V) oxo compounds were otherwise isolated* as the products of reaction (2) carried out in hexane-benzene solution. From the results presented in Table 1, it follows that catalytic activity of the oxo com- plexes depends on the structural properties of the remaining ligands. For the complexes with phosphite ligands, the initial reaction rate much exceeds that observed for complexes containing phosphine and pyridine ligands. The latter exhibit quite different donor-acceptor and steric properties in comparison with phosphite complexes. Unfortunately, the highly active *P=P(OEt)3; ReOCl3[P(OEt)3]2, IR: r(Re=0) 975 cm-1; 'H NMR in C(,D(, at 25 C, 6 (TMS, ppm): 1.24 (t, J = ^ .12 Hz, 18H, ?3), 4.32 (unresolv.m. 12H, CH,), \"P^NMR 5 H3P04 ppm): 57.42 s; P = PMePh:,; ReOC^PMePh,):;, IR: r(Re=0) 970 cm\"\"1; 'H NMR in CD^Clz, (ppm): 2.15 (d, <7= 8 Hz, 6H, CH3), 7.52 and 7.59 (un- resolv. 20H meta, para and ortho CgHs respectively). 349 phosphite complex undergoes fast deactivation, most likely due to interac- tion of the phosphite oxygen atom with the organoaluminum compounds. In order to gain further insight to the transformations of oxo com- plexes to yield the active forms of a catalyst, we have selected for additional studies the catalytic system ReOCl3(PPh3)2 1 + dichloroethylaluminum 2. Dichloromethane was used as solvent. Reactions were carried out within two temperature ranges: 50 - 30 C and over 30 C. Different 1:2 molar ratios were used by addition of 2 (0.2 M) in dichloromethane solution to the partially dissolved 1 (0.5 g, 0.6 mmol). At 50 C the only reaction was the isomerization induced by 2 (Scheme 1). The yellow complex 1 ?

The intermediate stage was the formation of the readily soluble light green adduct of 1 and 2, with contribution of the oxo group (Scheme 1). Isomerization in the range 50- 30 C is selective, and therefore almost quantitative isolation of the cis-mer complex la by filtration is possible. The isomer la exhibits IR i^(Re=0) absorption at 982 cm~1 (initial 1 at 966 cm\"1) and \"CWNMR (CDaCI;) complex spectrum in the PPh3 region, indicative of non-equiva- lence of the phosphine ligands. It should be emphasized that in any case, at different 1:2 molar ratios within the temperature range 50-+20 C, the dissociation of PPh3 or OPPh3 was observed. This was ascertained by the lack of the latter ligands in benzene or tetrahydrofuran solutions ob- tained by extraction of the reaction mixture, proved by the ^ NMR mea- surements. Isomerization is followed by the slower alkylation reaction of la with 2 via the chloride ligands (Scheme 2). The reaction carried out at ca. 20 C and a reactants ratio 2:1>3 affords rhenium(V) oxoalkyi complexes. At the ratio 2:1 < 3, the alkylation is not complete and isolation 350 Et -20 C l^0-^ < 3AICI,Et - - H Re-Et CH^CI, p/ P Cl 2_ 0 ' ^ Cl Re Cl P^ I P Et 1a . >3AICI,Et-^-* 4KC1 > Et Re^-Et - CHiLl^ -JKAILIA _/ i -KAlC^Et P 1 3 p Scheme 2. 3 of the oxotrialkyi complex is difficult. After removal of solvent and drying in vacua (2 X 10~3 kPa) at 0 C for 10 h we have obtained the brown, sticky mixture of compounds containing the A1C4 and AlC^Et molecules co- ordinated to oxo group: IR ^(Re=0-Al) 860 cm-', ^ NMR (CD^Cl;, 0 C) 5 1.02 ppm, t, CHa (Al Et). A small excess of organoaluminum compound (2:1 = 4.5) allows completion of the reaction and isolation of the oxo- trialkyi Re(V) complex 3. Thus, an excess of potassium chloride (4.0 g, 54 mmol powdered and dried in vacuo at 350 C) was introduced to elim- inate excess 2 as well as formed AlCIa from the reaction mixture, followed by slow addition of 2 and 3.5 h reaction time at 20 C. The precipitated aluminum salts and excess KC1 were filtered off and the solution was vacuum evaporated to dryness, yielding 3 as a brown powder. The structure of the oxoalkyi complex 3 was resolved spectroscopically in solution*. IR measurements of 3 in the region 3300 -100 cm~1 revealed the presence of bands characteristic for coordinated PPh^ ligands (1090s, P-sensitive vibration), ethyl group bands (1452s, 1380s), the (Re=0) stretch at 985 and simultaneous absence of the (Re Cl) stretches (320, 276) due to 1. The 'H NMR spectrum in CD2C12 at 0 C, (TMS ppm) of complex 3 reveals phenyl and ethyl proton signals at 7.65 (mult, 30H, PPh3) and 4.66 (overlap, q, 6H, CH^) and 1.54 ppm (overlap, t, 9H, CH3) respectively. These data suggest a cis-mer geometry similar to that of the earlier formed isomer la. Complex 3 is one of the few recognized oxoalkyi rhenium com- pounds [16]. It should be emphasized that it is relatively stable, in spite of the presence of (3-hydrogen ethyl group; it could be stored overnight in a sealed NMR tube at 20 C without noticeable decomposition. How- ever, at room temperature the thermal decomposition of 3 is much faster, * Attempts at crystallization of 3 at 25 C failed, most likely because of its insuffi- cient thermal stability. 351 and after a few hours the ^ NMR spectrum shows the signals of ethane (5 0.78s) and ethylene (coordinated 6.14s and free 5 5.40s) molecules. The above results allow us to propose the general course of the ther- mal decomposition of complex 3 (eqn. (3)), neglecting the details of the obviously complicated mechanism of these reactions. 0-H abstr.

At 25 C and at an 8-fold molar excess of 2 over 1, during 4 h reaction carried out in CH2C12 or in PhCl, the formation of ethane and the lack of notice- able amounts of ethylene were observed, eqn.

One of the most significant changes in the ^ NMR spectrum was the appearance of a broadened quartet at 5 6.70 ppm (J = 6 Hz) most likely due to alkylidene a-proton. Moreover, complicated changes in the methylene and methyl group resonating regions were observed. However, it is difficult to make conclusions based on these changes because other reactions (e.g. eqn. (3)) could proceed simultaneously. Nevertheless, these observations may suggest the occurrence of a-abstraction of hydrogen, with formation of the alkylidene complex 4 (eqn. (4)). The course of reaction was confirmed by IR spectra of the reaction mixture, where the i^Re^O) and ^(Re=0-Al^-) bands in the region 1000 - 850 cm\"1 disappeared and a new one appeared at 795 assigned to ^(Re 0 AK) vibrations. At- tempts to isolate the alkylidene complex from the reaction mixture failed, probably because of the complex system containing an excess of aluminum compounds and products of the above-mentioned side reactions. Hope- fully, replacement of alkylating agent, i.e. the ethyl derivative, by a methyl aluminum one will allow isolation and characterization of both the oxo- trialkyi and alkylidene complexes. Such attempts are the subject of our continued studies. References 1 (a) A. K. Rappe and W. A. Goddard III, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 104 (1982) 448; (b) J. Wengrovious, R. R. Schrock, M. R. Churchill, J.
