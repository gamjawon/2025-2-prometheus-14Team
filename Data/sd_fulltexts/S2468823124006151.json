Electrochemical nitrate reduction is a promising route for sustainable green ammonia (NH3) synthesis, yet the efficiency is limited by its sluggish kinetics and complex reaction pathways. Here we report three types of single-atomic site catalysts (SASCs) with well-defined Cu centers to electrochemically catalyze nitrate reduction, and demonstrate superior catalytic performances. Under appropriate applied potentials, the three Cu SASCs reached > 80 % NH3 selectivity and maintained long-term stability. The extraordinary catalytic performance is attributed to the abundant atomically isolated Cu sites with unique N-coordinated environments. Our work provided insights to the rational design of single-atomic sites for high-efficiency electrochemical NH3 production.

Introduction Nitrogen is an essential component of amino acids and nucleotides, the building blocks of life. However, human activities result in the overflow of nitrogen-containing compounds, especially NO3 −, present on earth, which poses significant threat to the balance of the nitrogen circle in nature [1–3]. Thus, converting NO3 − to value-added chemical products via a sustainable approach serves as an effective way to rebalance nitrogen circle for the environment amelioration. As an irreplaceable nitrogenous fertilizer, ammonia (NH3) has demonstrated its significant value in the fields of agriculture and chemical industry. Despite of the high efficiency and scalability, the industrial Haber–Bosch strategy for NH3 synthesis is very energy-consuming [4]. This process operates at harsh conditions (300–500 ℃, pressure >200 atm), and unsustainably employs natural gas as a H2 feedstock and yields greenhouse gas a byproduct [5,6]. Alternatively, electrochemical NH3 production is particularly attractive as it can work under ambient conditions in aqueous media, and is compatible with the utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy. As early as 1960s, electrochemical NH3 synthesis from nitrogen (N2) in atmosphere has aroused extensive research interest [7–9]. Theoretical calculations have also been conducted to predict the reaction pathway of nitrogen reduction on anchored metal site catalysts, providing guidance for rational catalyst design [10,11]. However, this electrochemical production suffered from low turnover as well as selectivity toward NH3, given a particular high energy input is required to successfully cleavage the stable NN triple bond (941 kJ mol−1) [12]. In contrast to the low-efficiency N2 reduction, electrochemical dissociation of NO3 − is much easier to perform and will potentially address the challenge of low efficiency in electrochemical nitrogen fixation, offering an appealing pathway in alleviating NO3 − accumulation, and also serving as a potential complementary strategy to the conventional Haber–Bosch NH3 production process [13–16]. Among the effective electrocatalysts reported for NO3 − reduction, copper (Cu) has received great attentions because of its adequate binding affinity to nitrate [4,14]. Multiple perspectives such as crystal facets [17–19], defects [20–22], oxidation state [23,24] and alloys [25,26] have been studied for Cu-based NO3 − reduction electrocatalysts. However, the inorganic catalysts generally suffer from cumbersome preparation, relatively low activity and selectivity toward NH3 production. Single atomic-site catalysts (SASCs), featuring a maximized utilization of metal centers, are emerging as an attractive category of catalysts with great superiorities in chemical stability, easy accessibility and structural tunability [27,28]. Multiple experimental and computational works focused on the preparation and catalytic application of Cu SASCs have been conducted, emphasizing their good reaction performances for CO oxidation [29], CO2 reduction [30] and organic coupling reaction [31]. In this work, we rationally designed three Cu SASCs, including pyrolytic single-atomic Cu on nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Cu-NC hereinafter), Cu phthalocyanine (CuPc) and Cu tetraphenylporphyrinas (CuTPP), and studied their electrochemical NO3 − reduction performance. Electrochemical tests showed that the highest NH3 selectivity could reach 89 %, 81 % and 82 % on Cu-NC, CuPc and CuTPP, with a NH3 yield rate of 5.1, 6.5 and 6.5 mg·h−1·cm−2, respectively. This work provided a feasible strategy for efficient catalyst design toward NH3 production through electrochemical NO3 − reduction, which may contribute to the alleviation of energy shortage and environmental pollution. Experimental methods Synthesis Cu-NC was prepared by a modified impregnation and reduction method [32]. First, 25 mg of graphene oxide (GO) was dispersed in 10 mL Milli-Q water and sonicated for 30 min. Then, a certain volume of 3 mg mL−1 copper nitrate solution was dropped into the GO solution under stirring, following the further stirring for another 40 h. Then the solution was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, which was freeze-dried using a freeze dryer (SCIENTZ-10 N/A). The as-prepared Cu-GO powder was then mixed with urea of ten times mass, heated in a tube furnace to 800 ℃ under Ar flow of 80 sccm at a heating rate of 10 ℃ min−1 and kept at the same temperature for 1 h before cooling down to the room temperature. CuPc (Meryer) and CuTPP (Bidepharm) were commercially available and used as received. Physical characterizations Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Gemini SEM500 FESEM (Zeiss). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were recorded using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin FETEM (FEI) at 200 kV accelerating voltage equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The Cu content in the catalyst was quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 5110 instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on Bruker-D2 PHASER. The surface element composition was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific K-α spectrometer equipped with an Al anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV) and the binding energy was calibrated based on the 284.6 eV signal of carbon. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained using a Titan 80–300 scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector. Results and discussion A well-defined single atomic configuration is fairly important for elucidating the structure–function correlation. The structures of three Cu SASCs were displayed in Fig. 1 . CuPc and CuTPP with isolated Cu sites and well-defined Cu–N4 coordination environments were selected as model Cu SASCs. For comparison, we also synthesized a carbon-supported Cu SASC, Cu-NC, through a modified two-step impregnation and high-temperature pyrolysis procedure, wherein graphene oxide was selected as a two-dimensional substrate to immobilize Cu, and urea was introduced as a nitrogen source to provide sufficient anchoring sites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed the layered structure of obtained Cu-NC without obvious aggregates (Fig. 2 a and b). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed homogeneous distribution of C, N and Cu elements (Fig. 2c). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed only a broad feature at ∼26°, assignable to the interlayer distance of the carbon matrix with a d value of ∼0.34 nm (Supplementary Fig. S3). From the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM), we observed abundant isolated bright dots, corresponding to single-atomic Cu sites (Fig. 2d). According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the valence of Cu showed a mixed state of +2 and +1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The Cu content was quantified through the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), indicating ∼3 % weight fraction of Cu. To control the metal content similar in three catalysts, CuPc and CuTPP were mixed with a certain amount of carbon black (CB), rendering ∼3 wt% Cu content in the mixture for electrochemical test. No obvious catalyst aggregates were observed on CB from the representative TEM image of CuPc/CB (Fig. 2e). STEM and EDS analysis also showed homogeneous distributions of C, N and Cu elements (Fig. 2f). Next, the three obtained Cu SASCs were evaluated for electrochemical NO3 − reduction by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry in an alkaline electrolyte containing 0.1 M KOH and KNO3 (pH 12.8) with a two-compartment H-cell (see Supplementary Information). For a parallel comparison, we chose a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm−2 for our study. The products NH3 and NO2 − were quantified through the indophenol blue spectrophotometric (IBS) method and Griess test, respectively, using UV–vis spectroscopy. An on-line gas chromatography was implemented to detect the gaseous products. NH3, NO2 −and H2 were observed as the major products within the testing potential range. No NH3 product was detected in an electrolyte without KNO3 (Supplementary Figure S5), confirming the produced NH3 indeed came from NO3 − reduction (Fig. 4). The typical current density profiles of catalysts biased at different potentials were summarized in Supplementary Fig. S6. As shown in Fig. 3 , comparing with CuPc and CuTPP, Cu-NC demonstrated a more positive onset potential for NH3 production, e.g., we can detect NH3 at −0.13 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), however, NH3 can only be observed when the potential shifted more negatively than −0.3 V vs. RHE on CuPc and CuTPP, confirming the higher activity of Cu-NC. That may attribute to the better electrical conductivity of the graphene matrix in Cu-NC, which can facilitate the rapid electron transfer [10] and deep reduction of the NO3 − reactant. While CuPc and CuTPP belong to nonconductors, the NO3 − reduction to form NH3 on them may need to overcome higher energy barriers. Notably, the NH3 selectivity of all three catalysts showed a volcano shape, reaching a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) at a medium negative potential. For example, as the cathodic potential decreased from −0.13 to −0.44 V vs. RHE, the FE of NH3 on Cu-NC increased from ∼19 % to ∼89 %, suggesting an increased negative potential benefited the deep-reduced products generation. Further reducing the potential promoted the hydrogen evolution due to the limited mass transfer of NO3 −. Remarkably, the optimal potential for NH3 production on Cu-NC was more positive than those on CuPc and CuTPP, e.g., the maximum FE of NH3 approached 89.2 %, 81.4 % and 82.1 % at −0.44 V, −0.62 V and −0.64 V vs. RHE on Cu-NC, CuPc and CuTPP, respectively, further suggesting the higher catalytic activity of NH3 on Cu-NC which may attribute to the better electrical conductivity of the graphene matrix, benefitting for the deep reduction of NO3 −. Beyond the selectivity, the yield rate of NH3 kept increasing at negative potentials. The highest NH3 production rate could reach 5.1, 6.5 and 6.5 mg·h−1·cm−2 for Cu-NC, CuPc and CuTPP, respectively, at a potential with a relatively low hydrogen evolution. Higher NH3 yield rate of Cu-NC under relatively low overpotentials (before −0.5 V) was achieved, likely due to the better electrical conductivity of graphene and lower NO3RR energy barrier [33,34]. In addition, we controlled the Cu content in Cu-NC to compare the electrochemical performances, illustrating that 3 wt% Cu loading is adequate to construct abundant single-atomic Cu sites without Cu aggregation (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the NO3 − reduction performance of previously reported catalysts. Our catalysts delivered high NH3 selectivity and yield rate under relatively low overpotentials, demonstrating the high catalytic activity of Cu sing-atomic sites (Fig. 3). Apart from the high activity, all three electrocatalysts exhibited a satisfactory long-term durability for NO3 − reduction, remaining 80 % (Cu-NC), 95 % (CuPc) and 70 % (CuTPP) of the initial current for NH3 production after 6 h of continuous operation at corresponding potentials, suggesting a remarkable stability. Conclusion To summarize, this work demonstrated three types of Cu SASCs for electrochemical NO3 − reduction, showing high-efficiency NH3 production performances. Comparing with CuPc and CuTPP, more positive NH3 onset potential (−0.13 V vs. RHE) and higher NH3 selectivity (∼89 %) were achieved on the pyrolytic Cu-NC catalyst, suggesting the high activity of the isolated N-coordinated Cu sites to electrochemically reduce NO3 − into NH3. Besides, long-term NH3 production stability over 6 h during 12 consecutive operations can be achieve on all the three Cu SASCs. Our results may provide strategies for the rational catalysts design toward green NH3 synthesis.

Here we report three types of single-atomic site catalysts (SASCs) with well-defined Cu centers to electrochemically catalyze nitrate reduction, and demonstrate superior catalytic performances. Under appropriate applied potentials, the three Cu SASCs reached > 80 % NH3 selectivity and maintained long-term stability. The extraordinary catalytic performance is attributed to the abundant atomically isolated Cu sites with unique N-coordinated environments.
