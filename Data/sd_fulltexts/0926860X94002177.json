The results of secondary ion mass spectroscopy imaging are consistent with cracking activity data and show vanadium preferentially accumulated on the calcium-exchanged clay in the presence of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst. This indicates that calcium-exchanged clay should be active for vanadium passivation in catalytic cracking. Keywords: Fluid catalytic cracking; Secondary ion mass spectroscopy imaging; Vanadium passivation 1. Introduction Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major process to produce olefinic gases and fuel oils from heavy hydrocarbons in the petroleum refining industry [ I ] . Since processing of cheap and metal-contaminated feedstocks is prerequisite for current refiners, the deactivation of FCC catalysts by metal deposition has been extensively studied [2-4]. Vanadium and nickel have been recognized as the major and poisonous metal contaminants found in typical cracking catalysts which consist of zeolite in an Si02 and A1203 matrix. Nickel passivation in FCC processes has been successfully conducted by introducing effective chemical additives such as Sb, Bi or Sn, etc. with the feed. The additives can be deposited together with nickel in an inert alloy form on the surface of the catalysts to deactivate the effect of nickel on * Corresponding author. Fax. ( + 886-35) 711082.

However, the irreversible decay of the cracking activity by the interaction of vanadium with the zeolite has not been completely resolved. Vanadium was found to migrate between and within particles and to be oxidized from + 4 to + 5 during catalyst regeneration [ 6 ] . Methods that increase vanadium resistance as reported in the literature [7-10] involve addition of many types of solid phases to the FCC catalyst: (1) natural clay, i.e. natural, acid leached or aluminum-exchanged metakaolin and sepiolite; (2) metal oxides such as magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, rare-earth oxides and y-A1203; (3) mixed oxides such as BaTi03 and CaZr03; and (4) natural zeolites that possess small pore structures or sacrificial zeolites. Vanadium may be trapped in such solid phases by forming stable complexes instead of reacting with the zeolite on the catalyst surface. Since the equilibrium constant for the formation of vanadates by reacting Mg0 or CaO with acidic H3V04 was found to be thermodynamically favorable at 697, basic alkaline earth oxides were considered to be potential vanadium scavengers [6]. Besides activity, the desired scavenger should have enough mechanical strength in order to be usable in a FCC unit. Simply adding MgO or CaO to a FCC unit was found to be unsuitable, since these particles are inherently soft and light [6]. Therefore, sepiolite of fibrous magnesium silicate [7,8] and magnesiumrectorite pillared with A1203 clusters [ 12] were recently employed in vanadium passivation. In this study, a calcium-exchanged clay, instead of soft and light Ca0 particles, was added to commercial FCC catalysts as vanadium scavenger. The passivation effect was examined by a microactivity test (MAT) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Because of its ability to view elemental distributions with ca. 0.5 Am spatial resolution at concentrations in the ppm range, SIMS has proven to be quite suitable for characterization of multi-component FCC catalysts composed of < 30% crystalline Y zeolite ( < 1 ,um) embedded in amorphous silica-alumina matrix of ca. 60 Am diameter, with several thousand ppm metal deposition [ 13 ] . 2. Experimental 2.1. Sample preparation Ca/clay was prepared from 1 g of clay by exchanging with 20 ml of 0.1 M CaC12 solution at room temperature for 5 h. Since montmorillonite was found to be the major component of the clay, a Ca/montmorillonite sample was prepared by exchanging 1 g Na+-montmorillonite (Kunipia-F, Kunimine Co.) with 20 ml of 0.1 M CaC12 aqueous solution. Both fresh and equilibrium FCC catalysts F-1 and F-2 (gas oil catalysts), R-1 and R-2 (resid resistant catalysts) were provided through commercial sources. The steamed FCC catalyst was prepared by calcining F-2 catalyst of at 1000 in flowing air for 24 h and heating at 816 for 36 h in 100% steam. The steamed F-2 sample was then loaded with 2 wt.-% cerium using K. 4. Chao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 217-229 219 an aqueous solution of CeCl3 at room temperature and heated at 540 in flowing air for 2 h to give Ce/SFCC. A cyclohexane solution of vanadyl naphthenate was impregnated onto a fresh FCC catalyst, a mixture of fresh FCC catalyst and Ca/ clay or Ce/SFCC, or zeolite LaNaY to generate a loading of 2000, 2480, 3650 or 4000 ppm by wt.-% vanadium. The solvent was removed by a rotary vacuum evaporator. The V-loaded sample was then dried at 110 for 3 h, was slowly heated to 540 under flowing air for 2 h and heated at 760 for 5 h in 4% steam/96% argon. The F-1 gas oil catalyst was also steamed at 760 for 2 h in 40% steam/60% NZ and then loaded with both nickel of 2300 ppm and vanadium of 4500 ppm through similar procedures using a cyclohexane solution of nickel and vanadyl naphthenate. Particles of equilibrium FCC catalysts and V-loaded samples were embedded as received in thermosetting epoxy at 60 for 12 h for SIMS measurements. The thin layers of epoxy-mounted samples were sliced using a microtome (Ultracut E Ultramicrotome) and pressed on indium foil with copper grid to ensure charge dissipation under Oz implanting. 2.2. SIMS measurements The SIMS analyses were performed with a Cameca IMS-4f ion microscope using a 500 nA, 15 keV, mass filtered 02 primary ion. The mass resolution was ca. 300 and the spatial resolution was ca. 0.5 /um. Positive secondary ion images were collected from a nominal area of (140 Am) 2 using a Pulnix, TM-7CN video CCD camera. Images were processed and analyzed with an IBM-compatible microcomputer run under home-built image analysis software. For most images, an integration time of 50 s was sufficient to provide a reasonable signal-to-noise on the final images. 2.3. Catalytic test Analysis of catalytic activity for Ni and V-loaded F-1 with and without Ca/ clay samples was performed using a modified microactivity test (MAT) according to an established procedure [ 14 ] . Prior to MAT testing, the catalyst was first pretreated at 200 for 1 h and then at 720 for 1 h in air flow, and- finally at 760 for 2 h under 60% steam/40% air. Tests were done at 482, 4.1 g of catalyst, 1.37 g of feed oil and a catalyst-to-oil ratio of 3.0. Liquid and gaseous products were analyzed with gas chromatography. Normal hexane cracking was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor system to give the intrinsic acid activity of the catalysts. 0.8 g of sample was sandwiched with quartz wool in a glass tube of 0.7 cm inner diameter. Prior to testing, each sample was heated from room temperature to 568, calcined at 568 for 2 h under dry air flow and purged by an argon stream for 30 min. Hexane was fed via a syringe pump with 1.5 ml h-' flow-rate. The products were analyzed by a flame 220 K.-J. Chao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 217-229 Fig. 1.

Results and discussion 3.1. SIMS imaging on equilibrium FCC catalysts 28Si+, 2' Al +, 139La+, and 51V+ion images of equilibrium F- l and R-2 catalysts are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Since both the zeolite and the aluminosilicate matrix, the major components of F-1 cracking catalyst, contain aluminum and silicon, the size of the catalyst aggregates or particles can be detected by their Si+ or Al+ image (Figs. la and lb). The brightness within an image is proportional to the relative elemental concentrations. A brighter area indicates a higher concentration. F-1 catalyst contains 2000 ppm La in its active component, rare earth exchanged zeolite, which is distributed within the catalyst particles and which can be identified K-J.

The overlapping of the 5'V+ ion image (Fig. ld) with the t39La+ ion image (Fig. lc) indicates that vanadium is more concentrated within the zeolite particles than within the matrix. This result is 222 K.-J. Chao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 217-229 consistent with the electron probe microanalysis result of Masuda et al. [ 10] . They also proposed the following vanadium poisoning mechanism: The vanadium from VOZ porphyrins in oil is deposited on the catalyst during cracking. Under the FCC regeneration, the deposited vanadium can be oxidized to volatile vanadic acid, H3V04, which then reacts with the La of the zeolite to LaV04 and destroys the zeolite structure and therefore the catalytic activity of FCC catalysts. Fig. 2 shows ion images of 28Si+, \"Al', 139La+, 5'V+ and 27AI +/28Si+ distributions on an equilibrium R-2 catalyst (a residual oil cracking catalyst with ca. 6000 ppm La and higher metal tolerance). Most commercial FCC catalysts contain 30% Y zeolite, of which the maximum content of La can be estimated to be 4200 to < 2400 ppm for Si/Al = 2.4 to 5.2 from the unit cell formula of Lan (A102)3n(Si02) 192-3n' 250H20, Si/Al= (192- 3n) /3n. The values of the framework Si/Al molar ratio of Y zeolites in F-1 and R-2 cracking catalysts have been calculated to be 5.2 and 4.0, respectively, from their unit cell aos of 24.5 and 24.57 with the linear equation of N(Al) -109.7 (ao - 24.217) [ 15 ] . This implies that lanthanum should also be present in the matrix phase of the R-2 catalyst. In turn, the ion image of 139La+ will then be unable to monitor the location of zeolites within the residual oil cracking catalyst. However, at least two components are distinguishable by 2'Al+/28Si+, 28Si+ and 27AI + images as the high Al/ Si atomic ratio phase at the left side of the catalyst particle shown in the bright area of Fig. 2d, and the low Al/Si atomic ratio or high Si content aluminosilicate phase shown in both the dark area of Fig. 2d and the bright area of Fig. 2a. In fact, alumina and clay are often added to the matrix of a resid cracking catalyst as trapping components for vanadium [ 16], which complicates the distinction between matrix and zeolite phases by ion images of Si, Al or Al/ Si. Quantification of SIMS data is very difficult for multi-component FCC catalysts due to the lack of standards and the matrix dependency of relative sensitivity factors [ 11 ] . In this study, the relative concentrations of vanadium on the zeolite and matrix phases of the F-1 catalyst have been determined by cross-correlation [ 13 ] . 139La+, 28Si+ and 51VI images have been collected and rapidly scanned on about > 20 particles. For all images, a resolution of 256 X 256 pixels on a square area of 140 X 140 mm2 was maintained. The average noise intensity was calculated from a square area of 22 X 22 Amt, which equals 40 X 40 pixels, outside the imaging area. When the average signal intensity is three times higher than the intensity of the noise, it is considered to be a real signal. 28Si+ ion imaging was employed in identification of gas oil FCC catalyst particles by Kugler and Leta [21. 27Al' ion imaging is used to monitor the size of FCC catalyst particles in this work, since the sputtering yield of A1 is larger than that of Si, and A1203 (one of the major components of resid FCC catalyst) cannot be detected by 28Si+ ion imaging. As elemental La is present only in the zeolite phase of the F-1 catalyst while Al is contained in both the zeolite and matrix phases, the area percentage of the zeolite phase in F-1 catalyst is equal to N,_,$/NA,, in which NLa and NA, are statistical averages of pixels contained in La and A1 masks (zeolite and particle masks), respectively.

The fraction of vanadium on the zeolite can be estimated from the number of pixels of the V signal from the zeolite mask region divided by that of the whole particle. Fig. 3 gives the relative concentration factors ( RC ) for V on the zeolite and matrix phases of the F-1 catalyst. The RC is defined as the percentage of V on a phase divided by the area fraction of that phase, e.g., RC for V on zeolite = ( % of V on zeolite)/(phase area % of zeolite). The RC value of 1.5 on the zeolite, which is greater than the average value of 1.0 for the whole particle, indicates that vanadium prefers to reside on the zeolite phase, rather than on the matrix (RC=0.9) in the equilibrium F-1 catalyst. For the R-2 catalyst, a comparison of Fig. 2c with Fig. 2e shows that the vanadium region\"is only partially covered by La the region.

Hence, the brighter area on the 2gSi+ /2'Al+ image provides 226 K.-J. Chao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 217-229 additional information about the locations of the Ca/clay particles. The location of Ca/clay is expected to be revealed by both 'Ca' and 28Si+/2'Al+ ion images (Fig. 5b and 5d) . Fig. 5 indicates that vanadium has been trapped in both the zeolite of the F-1 catalyst and the Ca/clay particles with RC factors of 1.8 and 2.7, respectively. This results in reducing the RC factor on the matrix phase of F-1 catalyst to 0.3. SIMS images of 'a+, '39La+ and 5'V+ distributions on R-2 catalyst with adding Ca/clay in the ratio of one to one (wt.-%) are shown in Fig. 6. The catalyst was calcined and steamed after 2480 ppm vanadium deposition. The particle on the right in Fig. 6b is Ca/clay (the brighter area on the Ca+ image) while the particle on the left in Fig. 6a is R-2 catalyst containing lanthanum (the brighter area on the 139La+ image). The RC factor for V on the La phase of R-2 catalyst (1.9) is greater than that on Ca/clay (1.0) (Fig. 4b). It seems that vanadium accumulates preferentially on the lanthanum-containing phase of the R-2 catalyst, rather than on Ca/clay in the mixture of R-2:Ca/clay=1:1. In the case of the R-2 catalyst mixed with Ca/clay in the ratio of one to three (wt.-%), overlapping 5' V + ion image and 'Ca+ ion image (Fig. 6e and 6f) indicates that vanadium is more concentrated in Ca/clay (RC factor= 2.0) than in La-containing phase of R-2 catalyst (RC factor= 0.8). The V-trapping effect of Ca/clay on residual oil cracking catalyst is also distinguishable, the La/ V molar ratio for R-2 catalyst of 0.89 [ (6000 ppm/ 138.9) / (2480 ppm/50.94) ] is much higher than that on F-1 catalyst of 0.19 with vanadium contamination. Recently, rare-earth vanadates were found to be formed on a USY zeolite-based FCC catalyst by introducing rare-earth compounds that were soluble in hydrocarbons with vanadium naphthenate [17]. Vanadium passivation by rare earth compounds seems worthwhile to be studied, since commercial FCC catalysts used in this study contain lanthanum, cerium is always found to co-exist with lanthanum in the rare-earth ore, and the formation of CeV04 has been observed in V-contaminated rare-earth Y zeolite by X-ray diffraction and laser Raman spectroscopy [ 18 ] . The effect of Ce as a probe for rare earths on vanadium passivation has therefore been investigated by SIMS measurements in this study. SIMS images of the 28Si+,\"9La+, \"e+, and 51 V + distributions on R-1 catalyst with added Ce/SFCC in the ratio of one to one (wt.-%) are shown in Fig. 7. The catalyst was calcined and steamed after 4000 ppm vanadium deposition. 28Si+ ion image (Fig. 7a) shows one R-1 catalyst particle (the brighter area on La + image, Fig. 7b) and two Ce/SFCC particles (the brighter area on Ce+ image, Fig. 7c). The RC factor for V on the La part of R-1 catalyst (5.6) is much greater than that on Ce/SFCC (0.6). This result indicates that the La part of R-1 catalyst has a higher potential to trap vanadium than Ce/SFCC. Two factors could account for this result (1) cerium species take two oxidation states [(III) and (IV)], so the cerium vanadate, CeV04, may not be as stable as LaV04 [17]. (2) The surface area of a SFCC catalyst is reduced by steam treatment. Therefore, cerium in SFCC catalyst is less reactive than lanthanum in R-1 catalyst with vanadium. K.-J. Chao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (19951217-229 227 Fig. 7.

Generally, 5-10% of the feeds contain sulphur that exists in the regenerator flue gas as sulphur oxides ( SOx) . The presence of sulphur oxides in FCC units may reduce the V-passivation effect of Ca/clay. According to thermodynamic calculations, S03 seems to react more easily with Ca3V20g than with CaVZ06 or CaZVzO.,, and La203 and LaV04 are more reactive than Ca3Vz0g toward S03 [ 19,20] . 3.2. Catalytic activity test Microactivity test results for vanadium and nickel deposited on F-1 catalyst with or without added Ca/clay (as a diluent and vanadium scavenger) are given in Table 1. A mixture of the catalyst and Ca/clay at ratio of 3:1 (by wt.-%) retains a MAT conversion of 58.750 (compared to 66.25% for the catalyst). Adding Ca/ clay to the catalyst decreases the yields of coke and gas ( C4 ) with increasing gasoline selectivity. The selectivity of clay is different from that of zeolite: it favors bottoms and resid cracking. It also forms less gasoline and increases coke, dry gas 228 IC-J.

This result indicates that the vanadium poisoning of F-1 catalyst can be reduced by adding Ca/clay. The intrinsic acid activity of FCC catalysts with added Ca/clay or Ce/SFCC was measured by a n-hexane cracking test. However, adding calcium-exchanged clay on LaNaY increases the activity for cracking hexane from 34.6% for LaNaY or 27.6% for LaNaY to 37.3%. A similar result was found by adding Ca/montmorillonite to R-2 catalyst as shown in Table 2. This table also shows that the effect of Ce on vanadium passivation is not as efficient as Ca-exchanged in clay. 4. Conclusion SIMS imaging shows that vanadium preferentially accumulates on Ca/clay in the presence of a FCC catalyst. The results from MAT test and n-hexane cracking also indicate that the addition of Ca/clay can serve as vanadium passivation to inhibit the deleterious effect on the zeolite. The trapping effect of lanthanum for vanadium on a resid FCC catalyst is more efficient than that of cerium on steamed FCC catalyst.

Fax. (+886-35) 711082. The vanadium distribution over equilibrium gas oil and resid resistant cracking catalysts and vanadium-loaded cracking catalysts mixed with calcium-exchanged clay has been determined. The results of secondary ion mass spectroscopy imaging are consistent with cracking activity data and show vanadium preferentially accumulated on the calcium-exchanged clay in the presence of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst. This indicates that calcium-exchanged clay should be active for vanadium passivation in catalytic cracking.
