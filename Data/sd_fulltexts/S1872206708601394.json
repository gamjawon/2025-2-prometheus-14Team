Their catalytic properties for the dry reforming of methane without a diluting gas were studied. The fresh and used catalysts and de- posited carbon were characterized by H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry, and temperature-programmed hydrogenation. The results showed that there were four carbon species that existed as three types, namely, amorphous (polymeric), filamentous, and graphitic carbon. The amount and type of carbon species on the catalysts depended on the size of Ni particles and texture of the support. The for- mation and morphology of filamentous carbon were clearly related to the size of Ni particles. Ni particles less than 15 nm suppressed the formation and deposition of filamentous carbons, decreased the amount of carbon deposition, and had more active C . species, resulting in a better activity and higher stability of the catalysts. Key words: nickel; lanthanum oxide; alumina; supported catalyst; dry reforming; methane; carbon deposition Global climate changes associated with the emission of greenhouse gases are of concern around the world. It is urgent to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases for environ- mental protection. The dry reforming of methane, that is, car- bon dioxide reforming of methane, can take advantage of methane and carbon dioxide, both of which are main green- house gases, to produce synthesis gas. This process is also of great industrial interest for the lower H 2 /CO ratio close to or less than 1 that is produced, which is suitable for the synthesis of oxygenated derivatives [1,2]. The dry reforming of meth- ane is particularly important for a gas field containing a sig- nificant amount of methane and carbon dioxide, such as CO 2 -rich natural gas and biogas including landfill gas formed in domestic waste landfills and digester gas produced in bio- reactors or digesters [3]. Ni-based catalysts with a high activity and better stability for the dry reforming of methane have been investigated ex- tensively in recent years [4–30]. From the industrial stand- point, it is more practical to develop Ni-based catalysts be- cause of their low price and wide availability [16]. However, one of the major problems in the dry reforming of methane is the high thermodynamic potential for coke formation [1,10]. Ding et al. [17] suggested that carbon deposition was inevita- ble in the temperature range from 573 to 1273 K from a ther- modynamics analysis. In the dry reforming of methane, methane decomposition (Reaction (1)) and CO disproportionation (i.e., Boudouard reaction, Reaction (2)) are two major side reactions that con- tribute to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, which lead to deactivation or destruction of the catalysts and a plugged catalyst bed [1,7,16–19]. CH 4 : C + 2H 2 � H 0 298 = 75 kJ/mol (1) XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 2CO : C + CO 2 � H 0 298 = –172 kJ/mol (2) The deposited carbon can have different structural order, morphology, and reactivity, depending on the specific reaction condition and structure of the catalyst [7]. There are three types of carbon that can be formed on the surface of Ni-based catalysts during the dry reforming of methane [7,9,20–22]. Many efforts have been made to improve the carbon depo- sition resistance of Ni-based catalysts. Adding alkali and alka- line earth metals, such as K [23] and Ca [1,24], and rare earth metals, such as La [6,18,25], Ce [10,26], and Zr [27], can improve carbon deposition resistance. The reaction tempera- ture and pressure also have significant effects on the resis- tance to carbon deposition [17,19]. In addition, the metal- support interaction [28] and the metal particle size [5,11,16, 20,22] play important roles in carbon deposition over sup- ported metal catalysts during the reforming reaction. Many reports indicated that bimetallic catalysts can greatly promote the resistance to carbon deposition in methane reforming [11,12,15,29–32]. Many literature studies on the dry reforming of methane were performed at high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) with a diluted gas flow and small size particle catalyst for reducing or avoiding carbon deposition and thus are not di- rectly relevant to industrially significant conditions. In the present work, the carbon deposited on the surface of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts modified by La 2 O 3 during the dry reforming of methane at a moderate flow rate without reactant dilution was characterized and analyzed using H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), BET surface area and porosity analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and temperature-programmed hydro- genation (TPH). The main species and types of carbon depos- ited on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different types of Al 2 O 3 were investigated. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 · 6H 2 O (Shanghai Hengxin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and La(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) of commercial -Al 2 O 3 (Wenzhou Jingjing Alumina Co., Ltd., 200–400 mesh). These samples were dried overnight at 120 o C and then calcined at 750 o C for 2 h in air. The powder catalysts were pressed into flakes, crushed, and sieved to ob- tain grains with diameters 1–2 mm (10–20 mesh). The Ni/La 2 O 3 / . -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared with the same procedure as used for the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst described above. The .-Al 2 O 3 support was obtained by calcination of -Al 2 O 3 for 5 h at 1200 o C in air [33]. The Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared by the evapora- tion method. An aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, La(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O, and Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was heated in an electric furnace to evapo- rate the water in the solution and crystallize the nitrates. The mixed nitrate crystals were dried overnight at 120 o C. The remaining steps were the same as the preparation of the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The Ni and La 2 O 3 weight percent content in all the catalysts were 10% and 6%, respectively. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The reducibility of the catalysts was studied by H 2 -TPR in a Micromeritics AutoChem II-2920 apparatus. Catalyst (0.1 g) was loaded into a quartz tube and heated to 120 o C in an argon flow of 30 ml/min and purged for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the carrier gas was replaced by 10% H 2 /Ar at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The temperature of the sample was increased from ambient temperature to 900 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min. The H 2 consumed in TPR was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The BET surface area, porous volume, and average pore diameter of the catalysts were measured by N 2 adsorption at �196 o C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface and poros- ity analyzer. A 0.1 g of catalyst was used for each analysis. The sample degassing was performed at 250 o C to remove the moisture and other adsorbed gases from the catalyst surface. The pore size distribution was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm by the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method. XRD analysis was conducted with a Rigaku D/max 2550 diffractometer using Cu K . radiation ( = 0.154056 nm) oper- ated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The scanning step of 2 was 0.02 o . TEM analysis was carried out on a Hitachi H 800/JEOL JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. The morphology of the carbon deposited on the reduced or used catalysts and the metal particle size and distribution could be identified. TG-DSC analysis with a Netzsch STA449C thermoanalyzer was also used to investigate carbon deposition. The used catalyst (10 mg) was held in an alumina crucible using an empty alumina crucible as a reference and heated from room temperature to 1000 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min in a mixture of 5% O 2 /N 2 with a flow rate of 120 ml/min. The TPH of the spent catalysts was performed in the same apparatus as described for H 2 -TPR, and the analysis process was identical to the H 2 -TPR. 1.3 Catalyst testing The evaluation of catalyst activity was carried out at at- mospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor (stainless steel tube, i.d. 15 mm) packed with 1.0 g of catalyst. The average catalyst particle size was 1.5 mm. The catalyst was reduced at XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 700 o C for 3 h in hydrogen at a flow rate of 30 ml/min before the measurement. The catalytic reforming reaction was carried out at 800 o C. The feed gas was a mixture of methane and CO 2 with a molar ratio of 1 without a diluting gas. The feed flow rate was 100 ml/min, which was controlled by mass flow- meters (Alicat), and corresponded to a GHSV of 6000 ml/(g·h). The reaction temperature was measured at the center of the catalyst bed using a K-type thermocouple. The gaseous products from the outlet of the reactor were passed through an ice trap to condense water in the products and metered using a soap bubble flow calibrator (Gillian). The compositions of the reactants and products were de- termined using an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC7890 II) equipped with a TDX-01 column (3 m length, 3 mm o.d.) and a TCD. Argon was used as carrier gas. The temperatures of the GC oven and TCD were set at 150 and 180 o C, respectively. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic performance In order to understand carbon deposition on the catalysts and provide meaningful reference data for industrialization, the stability tests for the catalysts were performed without a diluting gas. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The CH 4 initial conversion of the catalysts decreased in the order Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 > Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 > Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1(a)). CH 4 conversion over the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was stable after 100 h on stream and was higher than that over the other two catalysts. However, the CH 4 conversion over the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst continually decreased in the reaction period of 55 h. The amount of carbon deposited on the inner wall of the reactor around the catalyst bed clogged the reactor, which caused the experiment to be terminated. The CH 4 con- version due to the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst decreased in the first 13 h and then increased gradually until it was basically stable. This behavior was ascribed to the formation of new active sites when the catalyst was exposed to the reaction mixture that contained the reducing gases hydrogen and car- bon monoxide [11,34,35]. La 2 O 3 doped in the catalysts can adsorb strongly the reactant CO 2 and react with it to form oxy-carbonate La 2 O 2 CO 3 [34]. From Fig. 1(b), it can be seen that the CO 2 conversion of the catalysts showed an increasing trend at the beginning of the experiments, which suggested a slow process where an equi- librium between La 2 O 2 CO 3 and other carbonaceous species on the surface Ni crystallites was established [36]. The lowest CO 2 conversion was observed on Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 , and the CO 2 conversion on Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 was lower than that on Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 in the later stage of the tests. A higher CO 2 conversion favored the reducing of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface by the reverse Boudouard reaction (Reaction (2)). 2.2 H 2 -TPR characterization and analysis Figure 2 presents the results from H 2 -TPR. For the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 sample, only two major peaks were ob- served. The first reduction peak at 537 o C was attributed to the reduction of high dispersion NiO particles, and the second peak at 751 o C was due to the reduction of NiAl 2 O 4 spinel [25,37–38]. Three reduction peaks appeared in the profile from the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 373, 465, and 669 o C, which were attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO particles 0 10203040506070809010 70 75 80 85 90 95 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 CO 2 conver s i on ( % ) (3) (2) (1) Time on stream (h) CH 4 conver s i on ( % ) (b) (3) (2) (1) (a) Fig. 1.

XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 that did not interact with Al 2 O 3 , NiO that interacted strongly with Al 2 O 3 , and NiAl 2 O 4 spinel, respectively [22]. With the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, there were four clear reduction peaks at 398, 632, 764, and 844 o C, which indicated that four types of Ni species with different reducibility existed on the catalyst. The first two peaks were attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO particles and NiO in intimate contact with .-Al 2 O 3 [1]. The peak at 764 o C was attributed to the reduc- tion of non-stoichiometric nickel aluminate in the catalyst [39], and the peak above 800 o C was attributed to the reduc- tion of stoichiometric NiAl 2 O 4 spinel [1,39,40]. Comparing the H 2 -TPR profiles of the three catalysts, it can be observed that almost all the Ni species in the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was reduced below 700 o C. This will cause the migration, aggregation, and growth of the metallic Ni particles leading to the decrease of Ni dispersion, which is one of the main reasons why the supported Ni-based catalyst was easily deactivated [41]. However, it was different for the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts where some Ni species were reduced above 700 o C. This could improve the dispersion of metallic Ni particles on the catalyst. The results of the activity tests (Fig. 1) and H 2 -TPR indicated that the right interaction between the metal and support strongly affected not only the coke formation but also the activity of the reforming catalysts, which is in agreement with Goldwasse et al. [42]. 2.3 N 2 adsorption-desorption results Figure 3 shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the catalysts. The catalysts had a typical mesoporous structure. The N 2 isotherms were IV type and showed a hysteresis loop of the H 2 type associated with the presence of mesoporous pores. The textural properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. From Fig. 3(b) and Table 1, it can be seen that the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited a higher surface area, larger pore volume, and more pronounced mesoporosity. These catalytically favorable textural properties can enhance the dispersion of metal particles, improve the catalyst activity, reduce the carbon deposition, and increase the catalyst stability. Compared with Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 , the Ni/ La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst had a higher BET surface area but lower pore volume and pore diameter, and lower activity and stability as shown in Fig. 1. This indicated that good textural properties (pore size and dispersion) are very important for the catalyst to have a good catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane. 2.4 XRD characterization and analysis The XRD patterns of the fresh and used catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. For the fresh Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts (Fig. 4(a)), the diffraction peaks of -Al 2 O 3 can be observed. The .-Al 2 O 3 diffraction peaks and some other peaks can be seen in the fresh Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. When the catalysts were calcined at 750 o C for 2 h, the spinel compound NiAl 2 O 4 was formed in the catalysts, but in the XRD patterns, it was hard to distinguish this from Al 2 O 3 due to their similar morphology and characteristic peaks. The diffraction peaks of NiO were obvious in the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, but no such diffraction peaks were found for the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. This means that there was a higher dispersion of metallic Ni in the latter. It is worthwhile to note that in all these three catalysts, no La 2 O 3 diffraction peak was detected, indicating a high dispersion of La 2 O 3 in the catalysts. The diffraction peak assigned to graphitic carbon at 2 = 26.5 o (PDF 26-1080) was observed in the XRD patterns of the three spent catalysts, which showed that graphitic carbon was produced and deposited on the catalyst surface. However, the intensity of the diffraction peak of graphitic carbon for the catalysts was different, and the order of diffraction intensity 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 2040608010 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 (2) (3) (1) Adso rbe d v o l u me (cm 3 / g STP) p/p 0 (a) (3) (2) (1) Pore diameter (nm) d V /d D (c m 3 /( g � nm )) (b) Fig. 3.

The crystallite sizes of me- tallic Ni estimated from XRD line broadening by the Scherrer’s equation were 10.2, 10.0, and 7.6 nm for Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 , Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 , and Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 , respectively. This is the same order as that of the crystallinity of the graphitic car- bon in the corresponding catalysts. Therefore, it could be con- cluded that the particle size of metallic Ni was significant for the deposition of graphitic carbon and the bigger metallic Ni crystallites gave a larger amount of deposited graphitic carbon. It is interesting to note that the carbon formed on the catalyst did not seriously deactivate the catalyst. This implied that such deposited carbon had a porous structure and did not fully cover the metallic Ni sites [7,14]. 2.5 TEM characterization and analysis Figure 5 shows the TEM images of the used and reduced catalysts. Compared with the catalysts before reaction, the particle sizes of metallic Ni particles after reaction had in- creased to some extent. Fig. 5(e) and (f) show that some me- tallic Ni particles on Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts had already aggregated after reduction. However, on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, metallic Ni particles had ex- cellent dispersion and their size was very small (Fig. 5(d)). The carbon deposited on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was mainly in the form of whisker (fila- mentous/fibrous) carbon during the dry reforming of methane (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). The filamentous carbon was in the form of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) according to their morphology. However, the image of Fig. 5(a) showed that no filamentous carbon existed on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst with a uni- form dispersion of metallic Ni particles, which can improve the activity and stability of the catalyst. The Ni particles were located basically over the Al 2 O 3 car- rier in catalysts Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 and 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 (3) (2) (1) In te n s ity J -Al 2 O 3 I n te n s it y NiAl 2 O 4 NiO (a) Graphite Ni 0 (b) 2 T/( o ) (3) (2) (1) Fig. 4.

XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 isolated from one another. This resulted in the better CH 4 conversion of the two catalysts (Fig. 1). The decrease in CO 2 conversion on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst could be due to the deposited graphitic carbon, which mainly covered the ac- tive sites. However, for the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst, many small Ni particles were located at the top of the CNTs, which can also be used as active sites for methane reforming. The sintering of metallic Ni particles (Fig. 1(b)) and gradual ac- cumulation of graphitic carbon (Fig. 4(b)) were the main rea- son for the activity decrease of the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Many studies have shown that the formation of carbon filaments on the catalysts is influenced by the metal particle size [5,7,11,16,20,21]. Zhang et al. [11] reported that smaller ensembles were able to suppress carbon formation, but large Ni clusters showed carbon formation. A minimum diameter was required for Ni particles to generate carbon filaments [16,43]. Kim et al. [16] concluded that the average particle size has to be no less than 7 nm to form filamentous carbon. Kroll et al. [43] considered that the minimum metal particle diameter was 6 nm. Chen et al. [20] reported that the ensem- ble sizes of 3, 4, and 6 nm were responsible for the reforming reaction, water gas shift reaction, and encapsulating carbon forming reactions, respectively. Tang et al. [5] reported that the small size of metallic Ni particles was a key factor in pre- venting coke formation and the critical size of Ni particles to inhibit carbon deposition was suggested to be 10 nm. Figure 6 presents the Ni particle size distribution of the used catalysts from the results of TEM. The images of the metallic Ni particles were close to round as shown in Fig. 5. The size of most metallic Ni particles on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was less than 15 nm. Small particles can improve the activity and stability of catalyst. The Ni particle size on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was between 10 and 45 nm. How- ever, the distribution of metallic Ni particle size on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was very broad, and a few particles had aggregated and sintered to a size more than 100 nm. The aggregation and sintering of the metal will accelerate carbon deposition [44]. From Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, it can be reasonably concluded that the production and growth of carbon filaments can be effectively suppressed on the catalyst when the particle size of metallic Ni is not more than 15 nm. This is in agree- ment with our previous study [22]. Precipitated carbon atoms can diffuse through Ni particles or along a given crystallographic plane [45]. The diffusion of carbon atoms through Ni particles leads to the formation of filamentous carbon [46]. Based on the growth mechanism of filamentous carbon, the diameter of the tube is dependent on the size of the metallic Ni particles [44]. The diameters of the carbon tubes on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst were from 20 to 110 nm, which was consistent with the size of the metallic Ni particles (Fig. 5(b)). The diameters of the carbon filaments on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst were uniform with the value of 25–37 nm, and the thickness of carbon tubes was thinner than that on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst (Fig. 5(b) and (c)), which was related to the smaller metallic particle and narrower dis- tribution of particle size for the former. These results suggested that the formation and morphology of filamentous carbon depend on the size of the metallic Ni particles. 2.6 TG-DSC characterization and analysis Figure 7 shows the TG-DSC results for carbon deposited on the used catalysts and their amounts are listed in Table 2. The amounts of carbon deposited on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts were 17.46% and 12.41%, respec- tively. According to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, most carbon species were in the forms of fibrous and graphitic carbon on these two catalysts. These carbon species are inactive and can cover the active sites, leading to the decrease in catalytic activity (Fig. 1). For the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, the amount of deposited carbon was 6.73%, which is much lower than those on the other two catalysts. This result was consistent with the XRD and TEM observations. These three catalysts had the same chemical components, so the difference in carbon deposition resistance was due to the different size of the metallic Ni par- ticles and textural properties. From the present experimental and characteristic results, the size of metallic Ni particles less than 40 nm did not affect the CH 4 cracking but affected the methane reforming of CO 2 . The catalyst with the size of me- tallic Ni particles less than 15 nm had a better activity and stability, suppressed effectively the formation of fibrous car- bon, and decreased the deposition of carbon.

XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 better size of the metallic Ni particle for methane reforming of CO 2 over the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was less than 15 nm. A mass loss of only one strong exothermic peak from 500 to 750 o C was observed for all samples in the TG-DSC profiles as shown in Fig. 7. This was due to the oxidation of carbon de- posited on the catalysts and implied that there was only one kind of main carbon species for each catalyst. In the DSC profiles, the maximum peak temperatures of the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 , Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 , and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalysts were 717, 665, and 656 o C, respectively. Zhang et al. [47] suggested that the peak at 616 o C was the exothermic peak of inert carbon or graphitic carbon over a La 2 NiO 4 /ZSM-5 catalyst. Luo et al. [48] and Zhang et al. [49] reported a similar result and sug- gested that the mass loss at/above 650 o C was associated with the removal of filamentous or graphitic carbon deposited on the Al 2 O 3 supports. Based on the XRD and TEM results, the exo- thermic peaks in the profiles in Fig. 7 can be attributed to the oxidation of filamentous and graphitic carbon species. The exothermic peaks between 300 to 500 o C and above 800 o C were due to the oxidation of metallic Ni and the crystalline change of Al 2 O 3 , respectively. The mass loss below 200 o C can be assigned to the degassing of water contained in the catalysts. 2.7 TPH characterization and analysis Figure 8 shows the TPH profiles of the three used catalysts. It can be clearly seen that there are at least three kinds of car- bon species on the catalysts during the dry reforming of methane. Many studies [7,17,48–50] reported that three car- bonaceous species exist on supported metal catalysts when CH 4 decomposed on metal surfaces and designated these car- bonaceous species as C . , C , and C . The completely dehy- drogenated carbidic carbon C . is a very active and important intermediate in the carbon dioxide reforming with methane. The C . species was responsible for CO formation [48]. The partially dehydrogenated C species can react with H 2 or CO 2 to form CH 4 or CO [51]. C species can be produced by the interactions between C . and C species and between C . and C themselves [17]. The carbidic cluster C species had the low- est activity and would be the precursor of surface carbon deposition [17,51]. Guo et al. [7] reported that C . can be completely removed by hydrogenation below 800 o C, and about half of C and one third of C on Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 can be removed by hydrogenation. Rezaei et al. [14] identified the peak at above 600 o C as due to carbon nanotubes. However, if the inactive carbon species (filamentous or graphitic) can be hydrogenated below 800 o C, they would not be deposited on the surface of the catalysts because of the existence of the large amount of H 2 during the reaction at 800 o C. As a result, the inactive carbon species cannot be hydrogenated at all. The peaks at 200 o C and 300–400 o C in the TPH profiles would be due to the C . and C species, respectively, that were active for the dry reforming of methane. This is the reason why the catalysts kept relatively 0 200 400 600 800 1000 -1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 -0.6 0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 -2.4 -2.0 -1.6 -1.2 -0.8 -0.4 0.0 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5-1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 DS C (m W / mg ) DS C ( m W / m g ) Mass loss (m g) Mass loss (m g) Mass loss (m g) DSC (mW/mg ) Temperature ( o C) (c) (b) (a) Fig. 7.

XU Junke et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1076–1084 stable even though a large amount of carbon was deposited on the catalysts. The C . and C can be assigned to the amorphous carbon or polyaromatic type species [7]. The peak between 400 and 800 o C should be attributed to the C species that is amorphous carbon as well. From the discussion above, it can be concluded that during the dry reforming of methane, four carbon species (C . , C , C , and inactive carbon) were depos- ited on the catalysts and existed as three general types of car- bon, amorphous (polymeric), filamentous, and graphitic, as has been described in other references [7,9,20,21]. The C . and C species can be transformed to CO, with the activity of the former being better than the later [7,51]. Com- pared with the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 and Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts, the amount of C . and C species on the Ni/La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was smaller, as shown in Fig. 8. This may be the reason for its lower reforming activity. The CO 2 conversion on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was higher than that on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / .-Al 2 O 3 catalyst during the post-phase of the reaction (Fig. 1). This was due to the larger amount of C . species on the Ni/La 2 O 3 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. 3 Conclusions Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts modified by La 2 O 3 were prepared by in- cipient wetness impregnation and the evaporation method and were used for methane reforming of CO 2 without a diluting gas. The species and amounts of carbon deposited on the catalysts depended on the size of the metallic Ni particles and the texture of the support. Metallic Ni particles less than 15 nm can effec- tively suppress the formation of carbon filaments, decrease the amount of carbon deposition, and produce a larger amount of active C . species, resulting in a better activity and higher sta- bility of the catalyst.

Tel: +86-21-69589480 Ni/La2O3/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3/α-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation and evaporation methods. Their catalytic properties for the dry reforming of methane without a diluting gas were studied. The fresh and used catalysts and deposited carbon were characterized by H2 temperature-programmed reduction, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry, and temperature-programmed hydrogenation. The results showed that there were four carbon species that existed as three types, namely, amorphous (polymeric), filamentous, and graphitic carbon. The amount and type of carbon species on the catalysts depended on the size of Ni particles and texture of the support. The formation and morphology of filamentous carbon were clearly related to the size of Ni particles. Ni particles less than 15 nm suppressed the formation and deposition of filamentous carbons, decreased the amount of carbon deposition, and had more active Cα species, resulting in a better activity and higher stability of the catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Ni/La2O3/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3/α-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation and evaporation methods. Their catalytic properties for the dry reforming of methane without a diluting gas were studied. The fresh and used catalysts and deposited carbon were characterized by H2 temperature-programmed reduction, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry, and temperature-programmed hydrogenation. The results showed that there were four carbon species that existed as three types, namely, amorphous (polymeric), filamentous, and graphitic carbon. The amount and type of carbon species on the catalysts depended on the size of Ni particles and texture of the support. The formation and morphology of filamentous carbon were clearly related to the size of Ni particles. Ni particles less than 15 nm suppressed the formation and deposition of filamentous carbons, decreased the amount of carbon deposition, and had more active Cα species, resulting in a better activity and higher stability of the catalysts.",
