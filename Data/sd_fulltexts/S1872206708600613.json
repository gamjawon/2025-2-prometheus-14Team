Synthesis of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Narrow Diameter Distribution by Calcination of a Mo-Modified Fe/MgO Catalyst WEN Qian, QIAN Weizhong*, WEI Fei Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Reaction Engineering and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China Abstract: The Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst for the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from methane decomposition by chemical vapor deposition was pretreated by calcination at 900 °C for 10 h. A comparison of SWNT growth on the catalysts with and without Mo confirmed that Mo addition in the calcined catalyst was crucial in stabilizing and dispersing Fe nanoparticles to a small size, and thus, to synthesize SWNTs with uniform diameters. The products were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Ar adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that Fe-rich nanoparticles were the active sites for SWNT growth and the diameter of the SWNTs depended on the size of the Fe nanoparticles. The calcination led to the formation of the FeMoO 4 phase when Mo was added, which is a more stable phase than the MgFe 2 O 4 phase. The Mo/Fe ratio was also important in preparing SWNTs of high density, high purity, and with a narrow diameter distri- bution. These results are useful for the precise control of the synthesis of SWNTs. Key words: single-walled carbon nanotube; chemical vapor deposition; Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst; calcination; diameter distribution The synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has been intensively investigated because of their extraordinary electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that have poten- tially wide applications [1,2]. Since the applications of SWNTs depend on the uniformity of diameter, chirality, and purity in many cases, it is essential to achieve the controlled growth of SWNTs. Although arc discharge and laser ablation methods are both effective in producing SWNTs with perfect structure and high graphitization [3,4], the high-temperature evaporation used in these methods results in the formation of amorphous carbon, carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (NPs), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). In comparison, by careful loading of active metals and control of their dispersion on the catalyst support [5–7], and control of a few reaction parameters, including growth temperature [8] and feed gas [9–11], SWNTs can be prepared effectively in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process with relatively high selectivity and high yield. However, due to the high temperature used for SWNT syn- thesis in the CVD process, the sintering of the metal is serious, and it is hard to control the diameter distribution of SWNTs accurately because the metal particle size determines the di- ameter of as-grown CNTs [12], which is wide as shown by the weak intensity and wide wave number range of the RBM (ra- dial breathing mode) peaks in Raman spectra of SWNTs. Gen- erally, there are two methods to improve the stability of metal NPs used for SWNT growth. One is the pretreatment of the catalyst at a high temperature. For instance, a MgFe 2 O 4 phase is formed in the Fe/MgO catalyst after calcination, and this is effective in stabilizing the Fe NPs [13]. However, some ag- gregation of Fe NPs still occurs when the carbon source is introduced and the catalyst was deoxidized. The other method is the addition of another metal to stabilize and disperse the main active metal, i.e., in Fe-Mo [6,11,14–20], Co-Mo [7,15], and Fe-Co [21] systems, with different supports including Al 2 O 3 , MgO, SiO 2 , and zeolites. Although these methods are WEN Qian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(7): 617–623 effective in decreasing the size of metal NPs to 5 nm and sup- pressing the formation of MWNTs, a narrow distribution in the size of metal NPs below 5 nm is still a challenge. It needs a narrow window to get a SWNT product with a narrow diameter distribution. Here, based on our Fe/MgO catalyst system [13], we pro- pose the combination of Mo modification and calcination at a higher temperature than previously used [19,21] to increase the stability and dispersion of Fe NPs to prepare SWNTs with a narrow diameter distribution. We present detailed characteri- zation combining X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area measurement, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission elec- tron microscopy (HRTEM) to deduce the role of the catalyst in SWNT growth. The results are important for understanding the mechanism of the stabilization and are useful for the precise control of the synthesis of SWNTs. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Mo-modified Fe/MgO catalysts were made by impregnating MgO powder in a solution of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and (NH 4 ) 6 - Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O. This mixture was ultrasonicated to a gel, which was dried at 383 K, calcined at 823 K, and crushed to a fine powder. Finally, the catalyst powder was calcined at 1173 K for 10 h (the same temperature as the SWNT synthesis). The Fe/MgO and Mo/MgO molar ratios were 0.01–0.02 and 0–0.01, respectively. The total loading of Fe and Mo was (Fe+Mo)/ MgO = 0.02. 1.2 SWNT synthesis About 50 mg Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst was packed into a quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. With the reaction at 1173 K, Ar (99.9% purity, 18 ml/min), CH 4 (99.99% purity, 20 ml/min), and H 2 (99.999% purity, 2 ml/min) were fed into the reactor. The process for SWNT growth lasted about 15 min. The reaction system was connected to an online BET system [22], which was used to measure the BET specific surface areas (SSAs) of the carbon products at selected times. Thus, we were able to distinguish the type of the carbon products, that is, SWNTs, amorphous carbon, or MWNTs, from the significant differences in their BET values. In the Raman spectroscopy, the intensity ratio of the G peak to D peak (I G /I D ratio) was used to characterize the SWNT purity, with a lower ratio indicating more carbon defects. 1.3 Catalyst and SWNT characterization The catalysts were characterized by XRD (D/MAX-ⅢA diffractometer, Cu target, 10º–90º), EDS (INCA Project spec- trometer), and HRTEM (JEOL JEM-2010 microscope, 120 kV). The SWNT samples were characterized by TGA (TA-2050 analyzer, heating rate 5 °C/min, up limit 800 °C), Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw RM2000 spectrometer, ex- cited at 633 nm), HRTEM, and BET specific surface area measurement (single point BET instrument, Ar as the adsorp- tion gas, as described in Ref. [22]). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Comparison of SWNTs grown on the catalysts with and without calcination We carefully compared the SWNTs grown on the Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst with and without calcination (1173 K for 10 h). These products all contained SWNTs, catalysts, and some carbon impurities as characterized by HRTEM. Fig. 1(a) shows the SWNTs grown on the uncalcined Fe-Mo/MgO Fig. 1. TEM images of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) grown on the Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst (Mo/Fe molar ratio of 1:18) without (a) and with (b) calcination at 900 °C for 10 h. WEN Qian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(7): 617–623 catalyst. The catalyst particles (mainly the MgO support and some metal crystallites on it) were all small (about 10–30 nm), and the SWNTs coexist with many short CNTs and some bro- ken graphitic sheets. In comparison, Fig. 1(b) shows that the Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst after calcination at 1173 K was mostly large particles of 100–200 nm due to the agglomeration of catalyst, which is similar to other catalytic processes [13,23]. SWNTs were densely grown on these large catalyst particles, and these were wrapped around catalyst particles, which made the image ambiguous. The magnification of local regions of the same sample clearly indicates that the SWNTs were all in bundle form and the SWNTs were much more densely grown around the catalyst particles than that in Fig. 1(a). Moreover, the diameters of all these SWNTs were more uniform than that in Fig. 1(a), with scarcely any SWNT with larger diameters. The Raman spectra shown in Figs. 2(a2) and (b2) are those of the SWNT products in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The intensity ratios of the G band (~1590 cm −1 ) to the D band (~1340 cm −1 ) (I G /I D ratio) of these SWNTs were 15.4 and 11.1, respectively. The TGA data showed that the SWNT yields were 20.4% and 9.5% of the catalyst, respectively. These results suggest that the yield of SWNTs decreased when the catalyst calcined at 1173 K for 10 h was used because of the activity decrease of the catalyst due to sintering [13, 23]. However, the SSA values of the different SWNT products suggested an extraordinary calcination effect on the synthesis of SWNTs. Specifically, the SSA values of the two products from BET characterization were 816.3 and 836.5 m 2 /g, respectively. The higher SSA values of the SWNTs produced on the calcined Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst indicated that they had less carbon de- fects [11]. Meanwhile, there was an extremely intense peak in the RBM of Fig. 2(b2). From the relationship between the RBM peak position and the SWNT diameter [24,25], we measured the diameter distribution from 24 TEM images of the two CNT products. These are shown in Fig. 3. The SWNTs grown on the calcined Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst had much more uniform diameters (from 1.2 to 1.8 nm, Fig. 3(b)), compared with those (from 1.3 to 2.5 nm, Fig. 3(a)) grown on the uncal- cined catalyst. TEM and Raman characterizations both con- firmed the narrower diameter distribution of the SWNTs grown on the calcined catalyst. We also compared the effect of the Mo/Fe molar ratio in the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. There was little change in the carbon product on the calcined Fe/MgO catalyst without Mo, while the SSA value of the SWNTs sharply decreased by 17%. The result suggested the negative effect of calcination on the activity of catalyst in the absence of Mo. In comparison, the addition of Mo in a small amount (Mo/Fe molar ratio of 1:18) in the catalyst improved the activity and stability of the catalyst, and consequently, resulted in a slight increase (2.5%) in the SSA of the SWNTs. Notably, the intense higher peak in the RBM indicated a narrower diameter distribution in the SWNTs. Fig. 2. Raman spectra of SWNT products grown on catalysts with different Mo/Fe ratios without (a) and with (b) calcination at 900 °C for 10 h. Mo/Fe molar ratio: (1) 0; (2) 1:18; (3) 9:10. Fig. 3. Diameter distribution of carbon nanotubes grown on Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst (Mo/Fe molar ratio of 1:18) without (a) and with (b) calcination at 900 °C for 10 h. WEN Qian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(7): 617–623 However, the further increase in the Mo/Fe ratio to 9:10 of the catalyst showed adverse effects on the purity, yield, and SSA of SWNTs. Thus, by considering that Mo is also an active com- ponent itself that produces MWNTs from methane, the above results suggested that the optimal Mo/Fe ratio should be low and around 1:18. We also compared the SWNTs grown on the catalyst without Mo, and there was nearly no change in the diameter distribution even when the catalyst was calcined at 1173 K for 10 h. This is probably due to the aggregation of Fe NPs when the carbon source was introduced and when the catalyst was deoxidized. Thus, it was concluded that the opti- mal addition of Mo increases the dispersion of the iron species on the catalyst during both high-temperature calcination and the SWNT growth process. 2.2 Effect of Mo in the catalyst and the mechanism of calcination HRTEM images provided direct evidence that on the catalyst containing Mo after calcination, the metal particles were mostly smaller than 3 nm in diameter and were tightly em- bedded on the surface of the catalyst support after SWNT growth (Fig. 4(a)). EDS detection of the catalyst surface (point A) indicated that the metal particles were mainly Fe, which agreed with the evidence reported before that iron-enriched particles are exposed on the catalyst surface and serve as the active sites for SWNT growth [13]. In comparison, the metal particle size after methane deposition was about 5–10 nm when using a Fe/MgO (1.8 mol% Fe) catalyst in the present work. Part of this is too large to make SWNTs and can only make MWNTs. These TEM results confirmed that Mo addition was important for the size control of Fe NPs, and consequently the control of the diameter distribution of as-grown SWNTs. Fig. 4 clearly shows the dependence relationship between the nano- tube diameter and catalyst particle size, where a SWNT grew on each Fe NP. Now, we present evidence by EDS characterization (Fig. 5) of catalyst change during the SWNT growth process to under- stand the effect of Mo on the size decrease of the Fe particles. It was found that the average Fe/Mo ratio for the entire large particle in Fig. 4(a) was 1.07:0.08, which was almost the same as used in the preparation of the catalyst. However, the Fe/Mo molar ratio at point A was 1.26:0.02, which was almost 3.5 times the ratio over the entire catalyst (1.8:0.1). We also per- formed EDS scanning along the line shown in Fig. 4(a), and the EDS scan result (Fig. 5) clearly indicated that the Mg, O, and Mo species were almost uniformly distributed over the entire large particle, but Fe was enriched on the particle surface. The XRD spectra provided the exact compositions of the catalyst after calcination and Mo addition (Fig. 6). For the catalyst without Mo, the calcination caused the formation of a MgFe 2 O 4 phase, which has been reported in Ref. [13]. How- ever, a FeMoO 4 phase was observed in the calcined catalyst containing Mo. This is similar to that formed in a Fe-Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst by a slow oxidation process [20]. Since the EDS characterization showed that the Mo, Mg, and O species were uniformly distributed in the catalyst, we can deduce that the FeMoO 4 phase and MgFe 2 O 4 phase were distributed uniformly in the entire catalyst particle, while Fe NPs separate from the Table 1 Comparison of BET surface area, I G /I D ratio, and yield of SWNTs grown on catalysts with different Mo/Fe ratios without and with calcination at 900 °C for 10 h Without calcination With calcination Mo/Fe molar ratio A BET (m 2 /g) I G /I D Yield (%) A BET (m 2 /g) I G /I D Yield (%) 0 834.2 12.0 9.0 690.3 12.0 4.6 1:18 816.3 15.4 20.4 836.5 11.1 9.5 9:10 418.6 2.0 34.1 370.4 5.3 16.6 I G /I D : Intensity ratio of the G band (1580 cm −1 ) to the D band (1340 cm −1 ) in the Raman spectra.

Notably, the addition of Mo into the catalyst caused a signifi- cant decrease in the peak intensity of the MgFe 2 O 4 phase, as shown in Fig. 6. These data imply that the FeMoO 4 phase was much more stable than the MgFe 2 O 4 phase, and the formation of the MgFe 2 O 4 phase was significantly inhibited by the for- mation of the FeMoO 4 phase. Thus, the formation and sintering of Fe NPs from the reduction of the FeMoO 4 phase will be a relatively slower process than that from the MgFe 2 O 4 phase (slow deoxidation similar to the MoO x phase [26]). Conse- quently, the size of the as-produced Fe particles (Figs. 4 and 7) was controlled and much smaller than that in our previous results. Fig. 7 clearly demonstrated that the sizes of the Fe NPs were uniform and a SWNT grew on each Fe NP. The narrow size distribution of the Fe NPs allowed the formation of SWNTs with a narrow diameter distribution. These results confirmed that the calcination effect on the catalyst should be attributed to the formation of the stable FeMoO 4 phase, which conferred a high stability to the Fe NPs produced later. Based on the above characterization, the structure changes of the calcined catalyst modified by Mo are summarized in Fig. 8. On the other hand, the composition of our catalyst is in the optimal range for the acidity of Fe-Mo and the basicity of MgO suggested in the literature [19]. However, the present evidence confirmed that the structure of the catalyst is more complex than can be explained by the acidic and basic properties of the Fig. 5.

The explanation using the stable phase formation is more reasonable because it considers the possible serious sintering of Fe NPs in the SWNT growth process. 2.3 SWNT yield and selectivity TGA results suggested a decrease in SWNT yield over the catalysts after calcination, which is independent of Mo addition to the catalyst (Table 1). For the catalyst without Mo, the SWNT yield dropped from 9.0% to 4.6% of the catalyst weight. It dropped from 20.4% to 9.5% on the catalyst containing Mo. Although the calcination caused the loss of carbon yield to some degree, the addition of a little amount of Mo caused the SWNT yield to increase from 4.6% to 9.5%. This is reasonable because of the much higher activity of smaller Fe particles in the decomposition of methane to produce SWNTs. More im- portantly, in the TGA plots of CNT samples from the catalyst without Mo addition (Figs. 9(a) and (b)), there are two peaks at 450 and 510 °C, which were assigned to the SWNTs containing many Fe particles (or the carbon encapsulated with Fe particles) and with few Fe particles, respectively [27]. This was in agreement with the TEM characterization that some nanotubes contained Fe NPs inside them (Fig. 4(b)). In comparison, for the catalyst containing Mo in a small amount, the peak at 450 °C did not appear, and the intensity of the peak at 510 °C was increased (Figs. 9(c) and (d)). This indicates the higher purity (with few Fe particles inside) of the SWNTs. It can be sug- gested that the stabilization of Fe NPs by Mo made the Fe NPs tightly embedded on the catalyst support and difficult to get pulled into the nanotube [28]. The peak in Fig. 9(d) was a little narrower than that in Fig. 9(c) (especially the area around 450 °C), which was also due to the calcination effect to stabilize Fe NPs. These results are also indirect evidence that the stability of Fe particles was increased, and the diameter distribution of SWNTs was more uniform, which confirmed the effectiveness of the Mo modification and high-temperature calcination. Finally, we suggest that the time and temperature of calci- nation used were optimum. We found that a longer time (20 h) and higher temperature (1273 K) of calcination resulted in more decrease in the SWNT yield (about 1%). However, a lower calcination temperature (973 K) and a shorter time (5 h) were unable to form the FeMoO 4 phase. Thus, the uniform distribution of the SWNTs obtained in the present study was the result of sacrificing part of the SWNT yield. Further in- vestigation is needed to find a much efficient way. Our method is simple and the results are easily repeatable, both of which are good for the preparation of SWNTs with narrow diameter distribution at low cost. Fig. 9. TGA results of SWNTs grown on the Fe-Mo/MgO catalysts with different Mo/Fe molar ratios. (a) Mo/Fe molar ratio of 0, uncalcined; (b) Mo/Fe molar ratio of 0, calcined at 900 °C for 10 h; (c) Mo/Fe molar ratio of 1:18, uncalcined; (d) Mo/Fe molar ratio of 1:18, calcined at 900 °C for 10 h. WEN Qian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(7): 617–623 3 Conclusions By adding Mo and calcining a Fe/MgO catalyst at 1173 K for 10 h, we prepared stable Fe nanoparticles smaller than 3 nm tightly embedded on the catalyst surface and consequently prepared SWNTs with a narrow diameter distribution (from 1.2 to 1.8 nm) with high selectivity. The formation of a stable FeMoO 4 phase was important in decreasing the sintering rate of Fe NPs. The Fe/Mo ratio on the catalyst surface changed dur- ing SWNT growth, and Fe-rich NPs served as the active site for the SWNT growth. The study is useful for the controlled syn- thesis of SWNTs.

Tel: +86-10-62788984; Fax: +86-10-62772051; The Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst for the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from methane decomposition by chemical vapor deposition was pretreated by calcination at 900 °C for 10 h. A comparison of SWNT growth on the catalysts with and without Mo confirmed that Mo addition in the calcined catalyst was crucial in stabilizing and dispersing Fe nanoparticles to a small size, and thus, to synthesize SWNTs with uniform diameters. The products were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Ar adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that Fe-rich nanoparticles were the active sites for SWNT growth and the diameter of the SWNTs depended on the size of the Fe nanoparticles. The calcination led to the formation of the FeMoO4 phase when Mo was added, which is a more stable phase than the MgFe2O4 phase. The Mo/Fe ratio was also important in preparing SWNTs of high density, high purity, and with a narrow diameter distribution. These results are useful for the precise control of the synthesis of SWNTs.
