Box 1, Billingham, Cleveland, TS23 1LB, UK Received 28 May 1995; revised 29 July 1995; accepted 29 July 1995 Abstract The hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene have been studied over a palladium/carbon catalyst. The kinetics of the reactions were investigated and activation energies of 26 + 2 kJ rutl- and 41 + 8 kJ mol-~ were obtained for phenyl acetylene hydrogenation and styrene hydrogenation, respectively. Both reactions were found to be zero order concerning the alkyne or alkene. However the order in phenyl acetylene changed from zero order to first order at approximately 60% conversion. This change was due to the effect of styrene co-adsorption and not the concentration of phenyl acetylene. Competitive hydrogenation between the alkene and alkyne resulted in a dramatically reduced rate of hydrogenation for both species. This reduced rate was explained by a reduction in the amount of surface hydrogen as well as the altered bonding of the phenyl acetylene. Keywords: Phenyl acetylene hydrogenation; Kinetics; Palladium/carbon; Styrene hydrogenation 1. Introduction The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is of considerable industrial and academic interest. However, although the hydrogenation of alkynes in the form of ethyne has been thoroughly studied (for example see Ref. [ 1 ] and references therein), little work has been carded out on higher molecular weight systems. Much of the reason for this can be understood by the demands of the chemical industry, where the high tonnage polymerisation reactions of ethene and propene require very low levels of alkyne. Hence there has been a considerable driving force to both understand and optimise the selective reaction of ethyne to ethene. However on going to the higher molecular weight systems there is little or no demand for the alkene as derived from the respective alkyne. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Shaw/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 91-99 The hydrogenation of alkynes in the liquid phase has been used as a method of assessing catalytic activity [2-4] but often they have not been subject to a system- atic study. Competitive hydrogenation reactions are also rarely studied. There have been reports on competitive hydrogenation between alkenes [5,6] but we have been unable to find any competitive study of phenyl acetylene and styrene. In this paper we report: (i) on the kinetics of the liquid-phase hydrogenation of a high molecular weight alkyne, phenyl acetylene (Ph-C2H); (ii) on the kinetics of the hydrogenation of the alkene produced, styrene (Ph-CH=CH2); and (iii) on the competitive reaction between the alkyne and alkene. 2. Experimental The catalyst used throughout this study was a 1% w/w Pd/Carbon. Sufficient palladium nitrate (PGP Industries, Pd assay 10.123%) solution was added to a quantity of carbon powder (Sutcliffe Speakman, Ref. 9281 ) to thoroughly wet the carbon and achieve a 1% loading. The slurry was dried at 343 K for 5 h, then at 363 K overnight and finally calcined in air at 423 K for three hours. The dispersion of the palladium was determined as 18% by carbon monoxide chemisorption assum- ing a 1:2 CO:Pd ratio. The reaction chemistry was performed in a 0.5 1, stirred, autoclave which incor- porated a hydrogen-on-demand system sparged through the solution. The reactor also had a sample point from which aliquots could be removed during the reaction. The following procedure was used to reduce the catalyst and introduce the reactants. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen and 170 ml of dodecane (Aldrich, > 99%) added. A sample of catalyst (0.013 g) was added as a slurry in dodecane to the reactor. The reactor was then heated to 323 K, the system purged with hydrogen (BOC, > 99.99%), and the stirrer set at 750 rpm. Over the following two hours the reactor was put through pressure/depressure cycles of increasing the hydrogen pressure to 0.2 MPa, then reducing to 0.1 MPa, hence generating a flow through the system. At the end of this procedure the reactor was cooled to the desired temperature (temperature control 1 K) and between 0.1 and 0.5 ml of phenyl acetylene (Aldrich, 98%) or styrene (Aldrich, >99%) added in a solution of dodecane. The final volume of solvent was 200 ml. The hydrogen pressure was set at 0.2 MPa and this was maintained throughout the experiment. Samples (approx- imately 1 ml) were removed every five minutes for the first forty-five minutes of the reaction and then at one hour. Analysis of the products was by GC using a FID and a CPSIL 5CB column. The results were quantified by use of standard solutions. The absence of diffusion control in the system was confirmed by performing an experiment at 1500 rpm as well as 750 rpm; in both cases a similar rate of reaction was measured. S.D. Jackson, L.A.

Phenyl acetylene hydrogenation The hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene was carded out over a range of temper- atures (298, 303, 313, and 323 K) using a reactant concentration of 0.2% v/v (0.4 ml, 3.6 mmol, phenyl acetylene in 200 ml dodecane). Fig. 1 shows the change in product distribution with time for the experiments. An activation energy was cal- culated using initial rates: the value obtained was 26 + 2 kJ tool- 1. The selectivity of the reaction to the alkene (styrene) was determined at a range of conversions. Selectivity and conversion are defined as follows: selectivity = alkene/(alkene + alkane) conversion = (alkyne in- alkyne out)/alkyne in The variation of selectivity with conversion at the different temperatures is plotted in Fig. 2. High selectivity to the alkene is maintained up to conversions of 85%. A mass balance was performed on each of the above experiments. Initially there was significant adsorption of the alkyne, e.g., 22% of the phenyl acetylene was adsorbed at 298 K, while at 323 K 35% was adsorbed. However as the reaction continued the adsorbed material was desorbed such that at the end of the experi- ments the carbon deposition was below detection limits at 298 K, 2.5% at 303 K, and 10% at 323 K.

Little variation in activity or selectivity was observed and an order of reaction for phenyl acetylene of zero was calculated. 3.2. Styrene hydrogenation The hydrogenation of styrene was carried out over the same range of temperatures (298, 303, 313, and 323 K) as was used for phenyl acetylene hydrogenation, using a reactant concentration of 0.2% v/v (0.4 ml styrene in 200 ml dodecane). Fig. 3 shows a typical change in reactant/product concentration with time for an experi- ment at 303 K. An activation energy of 41 -1-8 kJ mol-1 was calculated. The order of reaction concerning styrene was obtained by varying the initial concentration of styrene in the starting solution. Little variation was observed and a reaction order of zero was calculated. The extent of carbon laydown was measured during the reactions and, within experimental error, no deposition could be detected at any concentration or tem- perature. 3.3. Competitive hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene The competitive hydrogenation between styrene and phenyl acetylene was per- formed at 303 K. Equimolar quantities of styrene and phenyl acetylene (3.6 mmol) were charged to the reactor, with all other aspects of the experiment remaining the same.

Shaw~Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 91-99 4. Discussion Phenyl acetylene can be classified as a terminal alkyne (R-C2H, where R is not H) and hence the hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene can be treated in the same manner as the hydrogenation of other terminal alkynes. There is not a massive literature on the hydrogenation of these species but there is sufficient for compar- ative purposes. The activation energies obtained for the hydrogenation of methyl acetylene, the simplest terminal alkyne (R-C2H, R = CH3), vary from 26 kJ mol- to 72 kJ mol- 1 over the Group VIII metals [ 1 ]. The value we obtained of 26 kJ mol - ~ for phenyl acetylene hydrogenation appears at first sight to be low for such a hydrogenation; however two other studies of phenyl acetylene hydrogenation also give values in the twenties. In one of these studies, on phenyl acetylene hydrogenation over a polymer-supported palladium complex, an activation energy of 29 kJ mol- J was obtained [ 7 ], which is in very good agreement with our value of 26 + 2 kJ mol- 1. In another study over a palladium catalyst [ 8 ], a value of 22.3 kJ mol- J was measured. The order of reaction in phenyl acetylene was determined as zero order from the absence of variation in reaction rate as the starting concentration was varied. How- ever the reaction order deviated from zero order in phenyl acetylene after approx- imately 60% conversion. In the later stages of reaction ( > 60% conversion) the system was found to be first order in phenyl acetylene. For example, at 303 K the data obtained below 60% conversion gives a zero order rate constant of 0.1259 + 0.0011 and a correlation factor of 0.9999, extension of the zero order plot above 60% conversion does not result in a good fit, the data obtained above 60% conversion however gives a first order rate constant of 0.1424_+.0.0041 and a correlation factor of 0.9967 (Fig. 7). Various other studies [5,9,10] have found a similar phenomenon, although usually at higher conversions.

Shaw/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 91-99 97 normally ascribed to the catalyst surface being unable to saturate with the hydro- carbon due to the low concentration in solution. If this was indeed the case in our study, then we would expect that at our lowest concentration (0.05% v/v) the system would be first order in phenyl acetylene as this is only 25% of the standard concentration ( 0.2% v / v). However even at the lowest starting concentration, zero order in phenyl acetylene was maintained until 60% conversion was reached. Therefore it was not the absolute concentration of phenyl acetylene in solution that was responsible for this change in reaction order. Note that the ratio of phenyl acetylene to total palladium, at 60% conversion of the lowest concentration tested (0.05% v/v), is over 110:1. However by 60% conversion the ratio of styrene to phenyl acetylene has reached, at all initial phenyl acetylene concentrations, approx- imately 1.5:1. Therefore the effect of the co-adsorption of styrene and phenyl acetylene is such that at these ratios the order of reaction for phenyl acetylene is altered from zero to first order. Thus implying that the alkene adsorption weakens the alkyne adsorption. In terms of reaction selectivity We can identify three reactions that may take place simultaneously, Ph--C2H ---> PhCH=CH2; Ph-CH=CH2 ---> Ph--CH2-CH3; Ph--C2H ---> Ph-CH2-CH3, i.e. A ~ B, B ---> C and A --> C. The selectivity to the alkene is high until nearly all the alkyne has been reacted (Fig. 2). However even at very low conversion there is not 100% selectivity to the alkene, indicating that either the reaction route A ~ C is available or that even in a vast excess of alkyne it is possible to adsorb and hydrogenate the alkene. From studies on ethyne (acet- ylene) hydrogenation [ 11,12] it is likely that both mechanisms operate. The hydrogenation of styrene is typical of terminal alkene hydrogenation. The activation energy of 41 kJ mol- ~ is in keeping with previous studies. An activation energy of 41.8 kJ mol-~ was found for styrene hydrogenation over a Pd/alumina catalyst [ 13 ] and a range of energies (33-45 kJ mol-l) was found to dependent upon solvent used, over unsupported palladium [ 14]. As expected the order of reaction was found to be zero order in styrene both by measuring the effect of varying the concentration on initial rates and by plotting (Po--Pt)=kt within a given reaction system. However with styrene hydrogenation, in contrast to that found with phenyl acetylene hydrogenation, there was no change from zero order even at conversions above 60%. For example, at 303 K the zero order plot over the full range of conversions gives a correlation factor of 0.9919, whereas a first order plot above 60% conversion only gave a correlation factor of 0.976. This confirms the hypothesis that it was not the absolute level of alkyne that resulted in the change from zero to first order. The maintenance of zero order is explainable in terms of the lack of re-adsorption of ethyl benzene. When the competitive reaction between phenyl acetylene and styrene was per- formed we may have expected from the high selectivity found in the phenyl acet- ylene hydrogenation, and from the literature [7,15], that there would be little styrene hydrogenation until a significant portion of the phenyl acetylene had been used up. However as can be seen from Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 the rate of hydrogenation 98 S.D. Jackson, L.A. Shaw/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 91-99 of phenyl acetylene was decreased by over a factor of two and the rate of styrene hydrogenation was also reduced. Analysis of the data for phenyl acetylene conver- sion indicates that when the order of reaction in phenyl acetylene is first order a best fit is obtained. This agrees with the analysis of the results obtained from the alkyne hydrogenation after 60% conversion when the alkene and alkyne were in a similar ratio. The results also show that the rate of production of ethyl benzene was significantly reduced. This reduction in rate, when both alkene and alkyne are present in similar quantities, has been observed previously in one of the few studies involving com- petitive hydrogenation of alkynes and alkenes. In the study of the hydrogenation ofethyne (acetylene) and ethene by AI-Ammar and Webb [ 16,17] the conclusion was reached, after confirming that the amount of alkene on the surface was the same whether or not the alkyne was present, that the effect was due to a reduction in the concentration of surface hydrogen. A similar conclusion was reached in a study of the competitive hydrogenation of alkenes [6]. However in both of these studies no attempt was made to determine whether the order of reaction had changed. In our case although we have no direct adsorption data it can be inferred from the weakening of the alkyne-surface bond that the alkene does adsorb. Note that after taking into account the hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene to styrene, a plot of log( [So] / [St] ) vs log([PAo]/[PAt]) was found to be pseudo-linear (Fig. 8) indicating some competitive adsorption [6,18]. Even so it is likely that there has been a reduction in available hydrogen on the surface that would reduce the rate. However given the change in reaction order we cannot rule out the possi- bility that the co-adsorption of the alkene and alkyne has changed the surface energetics in a more profound way, and that these changes are responsible for the reduction in the catalyst activity. The carbon laydown associated with the reactions is of some interest. When the alkyne was used there was initially significant adsorption; however as the reaction progressed much of the adsorbed material was removed by hydrogenation. Even at the highest temperature there was only 10% retained at the end of reaction. When 0.4 0.3 .. ~ 0.2 /1~ g 0.1 0t- I -0.1 [~ ..... ~ ........... -0.15 -0.05 0.05 0.15 0.25 LOG([So]/[St]) Fig. 8.

Shaw/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 91-99 99 the alkene was used no retention could be detected. This difference between the two species is to be expected. It is well known that alkynes have a higher propensity for carbon laydown [ 1,19]. However when the co-hydrogenation was analyzed it was apparent that although the extent of initial adsorption of the alkyne had remained effectively the same, the adsorption of the alkene had increased signifi- cantly. This behaviour indicates that not only was the strength of alkyne adsorption modified by the alkene but the alkene adsorption was also modified in such a way as to increase retention by the catalyst. Such behaviour would also be expected to reduce the activity of the catalyst. 5. Conclusions We have investigated the hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene over a Pd/carbon catalyst. The kinetic parameters found were typical for the class of compounds. However at high conversions the order of reaction for phenyl acetylene was altered from zero to first order by the effect of styrene build-up in the system. Co-hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene resulted in a reduced activity for both, and a change in the strength of both styrene and phenyl acetylene bonding to the surface. The reduction in activity may have been due to this change or a reduction in the effective surface concentration of hydrogen. References [ 1 ] G. Webb, in C.H. Bamford and C.F.H.

APCATA 95001948 0926-860X(95)00194-8 10.1016/0926-860X(95)00194-8 Article The liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene on a palladium/carbon catalyst S.David Jackson ∗ Lindsay A. Shaw ICI Katalco, R.T. & E. Group, P.O. Box 1, Billingham, Cleveland, TS23 1LB, UK ∗ Corresponding author. The hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene have been studied over a palladium/carbon catalyst. The kinetics of the reactions were investigated and activation energies of 26±2 kJ mol−1 and 41±8 kJ mol−1 were obtained for phenyl acetylene hydrogenation and styrene hydrogenation, respectively. Both reactions were found to be zero order concerning the alkyne or alkene. However the order in phenyl acetylene changed from zero order to first order at approximately 60% conversion. This change was due to the effect of styrene co-adsorption and not the concentration of phenyl acetylene. Competitive hydrogenation between the alkene and alkyne resulted in a dramatically reduced rate of hydrogenation for both species. This reduced rate was explained by a reduction in the amount of surface hydrogen as well as the altered bonding of the phenyl acetylene.
