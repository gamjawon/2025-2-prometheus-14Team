Fig. 1 Nitrogen physisorption isotherms of Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. Samples are first degassed on a Micromeritics SmartVacPrep at 140 °C for 16 h and are then degassed in situ for 4 h. Isotherms all begin from the origin. Fig. 2 (Left) TGA curves of Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. Samples are previously calcined and allowed to be exposed to ambient air and moisture for 24 h before thermogravimetric analysis. (Right) Water adsorption isotherms of materials collected at room temperatures (∼298 K). Fig. 3 29Si DP MAS NMR of Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF calcined samples collected on a 500 MHz spectrometer. Q2, Q3, and Q4 sites are reported at −93, −102, and −111 ppm, respectfively. All 29Si chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS at 0 ppm. Fig. 4 Comparison of the conversion of epichlorohydrin with methanol over time for conventional Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta untreated, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. ﻿The amount of catalyst added is scaled to achieve an epoxide:Sn of 250:1. Error bars indicate one standard deviation over three tests. The reaction conditions are: 0.4 M epichlorohydrin in 2 mL methanol, 20 μL DGDE (internal standard), 60 °C, and 600 RPM. For each catalyst, the selectivity is determined to be 97% for the terminal ether at all time points. Fig. 5 Comparison of the conversion of 1,2-epoxyhexane with ethanol over time for conventional Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta untreated, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. ﻿The amount of catalyst added is scaled to achieve an epoxide:Sn of 250:1. The reaction conditions are: 0.4 M 1,2-epoxyhexane in 2 mL ethanol, 20 μL DGDE (internal standard), 60 °C, and 600 RPM. For each catalyst, the selectivity is determined to be 60% for the terminal ether at all time points. Fig. 6 19F MAS NMR spectra of tested materials. All materials are tested after calcination with the exception of nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF-assynth. For nano-Sn-Beta, Sn-Beta, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF-assynth, the number of scans is 128 whereas 24 k scans are recorded for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF-NMe4OH. All spectra are referenced to CFCl3. Fig. 7 Comparison of the normalized TOF for TEA poisoning experiments of conventional Sn-Beta, nano-Sn-Beta untreated, and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF samples, demonstrating relative catalyst performance for the opening of epichlorohydrin with methanol with increasing amounts of TEA, up to a 1 to 1 molar ratio with Sn calculated by elemental analysis. Each curve is normalized by their maximum turnover frequency at TEA:Sn of 0:1. The dashed black line shows a linear fit for conventional Sn-Beta.

Graphical abstract Elucidation of synthesis-structure–reactivity relationships can help to enhance the catalytic performance of zeolites for a broad range of reactions. Considerable focus has been on examining structure–reactivity behavior of the catalytic site, but it has become increasingly evident that molecular interactions beyond the catalytic site in the outer sphere impact catalytic activity. The key challenge is to create synthetic methods that can create well-defined catalytic materials with control over catalytic sites and the catalytic reaction environment. After synthesizing nano-Sn-Beta using a hydrothermal method involving hydroxide ions that produce a hydrophilic material, these materials are treated with tetraethylammonium fluoride (TEAF) using mild conditions to produce a hydrophobic framework while maintaining the small particle size. The fluoride treated material is determined to be more active in the epoxide ring opening reaction than the as-synthesized nano-Sn-Beta (90% increase in TOF0), indicating that a hydrophobic framework is beneficial for the alcohol ring opening of epoxides. This is supported by site quantification experiments and an analysis of residual fluorine, which is found to have limited effect on activity. When accounting for the fraction of active sites, it is demonstrated for the methanol ring opening of epichlorohydrin that all hydrophobic materials are not diffusion limited under the reaction conditions and have the same turnover frequencies, which are higher than the turnover frequency of hydrophilic catalysts. Overall, this work reports a technique to improve the hydrophobicity of zeolite beta and demonstrates the importance of a hydrophobic reaction environment for the alcohol ring opening of epoxides. Keywords Post-synthetic Fluoride Zeolite Beta Lewis acid zeolite Hydrophobicity Epoxide ring-opening 1 Introduction Controlling molecular interactions within heterogeneous catalysts has been a long-standing challenge as the environment around the active site can play a significant role during catalysis [1–4]. As synthetic methods advance, the ability to tune different material properties enables investigation of structure–reactivity relationships to elucidate the impact of the interaction of the catalyst with the substrates [5]. In particular, zeolites are an important class of heterogeneous catalysts, as the many unique frameworks and crystal compositions can be used in a wide range of catalysis applications [6]. Indeed, their tunable and well-defined pore structure allows for exquisite control of shape selectivity and size exclusion for a wide range of chemical reactions occurring within their pores [7,8]. However, the small pores also introduce diffusion limitations that can limit their use for applications relevant to pharmaceutical manufacture [9]. This has prompted modification of synthetic methods to produce zeolites with nanoscale dimensions to increase the overall effectiveness of the catalytic material [10]. Whereas synthetic methods to produce nanomaterials exist, these syntheses often result in limited control over other characteristics of the material, including hydrophobicity [11–14]. With recent studies indicating the tremendous importance of the polarity of the reaction environment around catalytic sites in zeolites [15–18], additional work is necessary to examine how to balance accessibility and hydrophobicity for different nano-zeolite frameworks. One particular catalyst of interest is zeolite Sn-Beta since it can be used in many reactions, including glucose isomerization to fructose [19,20], ethanol dehydration [21], Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction and Oppenauer oxidation (MPVO) [22], Baeyer-Villiger oxidation [23], Diels-Alder chemistry [24], and aldol chemistry [25,26]. These catalysts are conventionally synthesized in fluoride media, leading to a hydrophobic material. The fluoride ion etches amorphous domains to limit formation of materials with defects, however, the fluoride ions result in extended crystallization times [27]. These reaction conditions tend to limit crystal nucleation, resulting in few nuclei that subsequently grow to large dimensions [28]. The large crystals coupled with the small pores of the zeolite can result in a low effectiveness factor for the catalysts because of diffusion limitations [11,29,30]. Diffusion limitations significantly impact large crystals and can be mitigated through producing nano-sized crystals [31,32]. The synthesis of nano-zeolites typically uses hydroxide media since inclusion of hydroxide as the mineralizing agent can increase zeolite nucleation, resulting in many small nuclei that only grow to limited dimensions [33,34]. Previously, our group has reported on the synthesis of nano-sized Sn-MFI [35] and nano-sized Sn-Beta [36], that could overcome diffusion limitations for the epoxide ring opening (ERO) reaction with bulky substrates. Whereas these nano-zeolites are useful for converting bulky molecules, they tend to have many defects. These defects are the result of the rapid nucleation and growth, which limit the crystal from filling all voids, resulting in silanol defects in the materials [37]. These silanol groups provide many hydrogen bonding sites throughout the structure, making the material hydrophilic. Evidence continues to emerge that the hydrophobicity of the material can be a factor in its stability over time as well as having a significant impact on its catalytic activity [9,15,38,39]. Recent studies have investigated methods to tune both the internal and external hydrophobicity of zeolites [32,38,40,41]. One approach is to introduce more silicon growth precursors or silylating agents, as has been done to the external surface of zeolite FAU with organosilanes, improving the catalytic performance for biofuel upgrading reactions [40]. Whereas improving the external hydrophobicity of the catalyst has been shown to increase the stability of the catalyst, particularly in aqueous reaction environments, it is becoming increasingly evident that the chemical environment in the pores has a significant role in catalysis [16,17,42]. Therefore, it is important to identify methods that are able to modify the hydrophobicity throughout catalyst and not just on the surface. A few approaches aim to increase hydrophobicity by chemically healing the silanol nest defects inside the material. One group has used gaseous trimethylchlorosilane to bind to silanol nests, completing the Si-O-Si bridges upon calcination [38]. These silylating agents can be an attractive way to modify zeolite hydrophobicity, provided that the silylating agent can penetrate the zeolite structure without blocking the pores of the material and reducing its microporosity. A group working with zeolite MFI has shown that these defects can be reduced through a post-synthetic treatment with fluoride [32]. They treated as-made silicalite-1 with ammonium fluoride to heal silanol defects to obtain highly resolved peaks in the 29Si NMR spectra. This treatment allows for partial recrystallization of the framework and controlled fluoride etching of amorphous domains with the organic structure directing agent (SDA) still present in the material. Although this strategy is promising to remove defects in zeolite frameworks, similar strategies have received limited attention for zeolite Beta [41]. Initial work for zeolite Beta demonstrated a high temperature process (i.e., 170°C) that used a SDA for zeolite Beta and limited amount of water to avoid collapse of the structure. The promising work investigated a limited scope of treatment conditions that would be beneficial to expand if possible. The current work will describe a post-synthetic modification of nano-zeolite Sn-Beta to reduce the quantity of silanol defects. The strategy involves treating the material using a fluoride source to modify silanols in the material and to reduce defects. This treatment is applied to the hydrophilic nano-Sn-Beta. The materials are characterized using a battery of standard techniques, including XRD, TGA, N2 and H2O physisorption, FTIR as well as 19F and 29Si NMR. The materials are tested for catalytic activity in the epoxide ring opening reaction with alcohols of both small and bulky substrates. The catalytic activity on a per site basis is determined through quantifying the number of active sites using a series of poisoning tests. Overall, this work demonstrates a post-synthetic modification of nano-Sn-Beta to produce a hydrophobic framework and the effect of hydrophobicity on catalytic activity and selectivity. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Catalyst synthesis The tin-substituted form of zeolite beta with nanoscale dimensions (nano-Sn-Beta) and conventional dimensions (Sn-Beta) are synthesized using procedures previously reported in literature. [36,43] Detailed synthesis conditions are reported in the Supporting Information section S1. 2.2 Fluoride treatment The post synthesis treatment of nano-Sn-Beta is performed through modifying a procedure for MFI reported previously [32]. A 1 M solution of either ammonium fluoride or tetraethylammonium fluoride (TEAF) is prepared in DI water. To a Teflon liner, 0.75 g of calcined zeolite is added, followed by the fluoride solution (6.75 mL corresponding to 9 mL solution/g zeolite). The liner is sealed in a stainless-steel acid digestion bomb and placed in a pre-heated oven under static conditions for a fixed amount of time. The acid digestion bomb is removed from the oven and quenched under cold tap water. The treated material is separated through centrifugation and calcined in air at 550°C for 10 h. This material is labeled as nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. 2.3 Material characterization The materials are analyzed using standard characterization techniques, including nitrogen and water physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), diffuse reflectance ultra-violet visible spectroscopy (DRUVS), thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), elemental analysis (ICP-OES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 19F and 29Si MAS NMR. The textural properties are characterized using a Micromeritics 3Flex surface characterization analyzer. The samples are first degassed on a Micromeritics SmartVacPrep sample preparation device at 140°C under vacuum (10−3 mmHg) for 16 h followed by in situ degassing of samples on the 3Flex instrument for 4 h at 140°C under vacuum (5 × 10−5 mmHg). The nitrogen physisorption isotherms of degassed samples are recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures (∼77 K). The water adsorption isotherms of degassed samples are recorded at room temperatures (∼298 K). The surface area and micropore volume of the materials are reported using BET and the t-plot method, respectively. The PXRD is collected using a Bruker powder X-ray diffractometer in flat plate reflection, Bragg Brentano optics mode using Cu Kα 1- Kα2 radiation (λ = 1.540 and 1.544 Å) at 40 kV, 40 mA, and room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are collected on a FEI Apreo instrument using secondary electrons (SE) and backscatter electrons (BSE) at 5.0 kV and 0.20 nA. Samples are first coated with a thin film of Au to avoid charging effects. All the materials are characterized for elemental analysis by Galbraith Laboratories using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to determine the weight percent of heteroatom (Sn) in the material. DRIFTS is performed using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with MCT-A liquid nitrogen cooled detector (32 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution). The DRIFTS set up includes a Praying Mantis cell (Harrick Scientific Products, Inc.) with a high temperature reaction chamber that consists of zinc selenide (ZnSe) windows. The material is initially degassed in situ at 500°C for 90 min under a nitrogen flow before cooling to 25°C. Similar to previous work [44], the material is pulsed with deuterated-acetonitrile using a VICI 6-port valve equipped with 100 μL sample loop. The DRUV–vis spectra are collected on Evolution 300 UV–Vis spectrometer with a resolution of 2 nm at a rate of 10 nm s−1 with pure silica analogues of materials as the background. TGA is performed on a STA 449 F5 Jupiter® (NETZSCH instruments) under flowing air (20 mL min−1) and nitrogen (20 mL min−1; protective gas) at a ramp rate of 10°C min−1 from 30°C to 900°C followed by a 5 min hold at 900°C. Solution phase 1H NMR of the synthesized SDA is collected using Bruker Advance III 400 MHz spectrometer, using deuterated water as the solvent. High resolution 29Si (99.3 MHz) NMR spectra are collected at 298 K on a Varian 500 MHz (1H) NMR spectrometer by using a Chemagnetics T3 HXY 3.2 mm probe for magic angle spinning. Samples are spun at 5 kHz in 3.2 mm ceramic rotors. Proton decoupling field strength is set to ∼100 kHz and is carried out using a tppm15 decoupling scheme. Spectra are collected using 8 k transients, a spectral window of 25000 Hz, a 40 ms acquisition time, and a 10.0 s relaxation delay. Each spectrum has the same subsequent processing parameters applied − 40 Hz line broadening, 16 k points zero filling. The 29Si chemical shifts are reported relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at 0 ppm. High resolution 19F (752.97 MHz) NMR spectra are collected on a Bruker AVIIIHD 800 MHz (1H) NMR spectrometer by using a 3.2 mm wide-bore HXY probe for magic angle spinning. Samples are spun at 20 kHz in 3.2 mm ceramic rotors. 19F MAS experiments are carried out using a rotor synchronized Hahn echo using a 19F 90 degree pulse of 2.5 μs with a corresponding 5 μs duration echo pulse. Spectra are using 24 k transients, a spectral window of 312,500 Hz, and a 3.0 s relaxation delay.The 19F chemical shifts are reported indirectly using Na3AlF6 (cryolite) reported at −190.4 ppm relative to CFCl3. 2.4 Catalytic testing The catalytic testing is performed in a two neck 10 mL round bottom (RB) flask equipped with a condenser, a magnetic stir bar, and a septum. The RB is filled with 2 mL of a solution containing 0.4 M epoxide and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (DGDE; internal standard) in neat alcohol. An initial sample (40 μL) is taken and diluted with acetone (∼2 mL) to serve as the initial concentration data point. The required amount of catalyst is then added to the RB to achieve an epoxide:Sn of 250:1. After adding the catalyst, the RB is immersed in a silicone oil bath, pre-heated to the desired temperature of 60°C. At specific times, a sample (40 μL) is withdrawn from the reaction mixture using a reusable stainless-steel needle and is filtered using a small plug of silica and diluted with acetone. The samples are analyzed using gas chromatography (Agilent, 7820A using a Agilent HP-5 ms Ultra Inert column) equipped with flame ionization detector (GC-FID), and the conversion is computed using the internal standard method. 2.5 Quantification of the fraction of active catalytic sites The site quantification experiments are performed in a similar manner to catalytic testing. The same amount of catalyst used in the catalytic testing is added to a 10 mL RB flask. To this, a varying amount of triethylamine (TEA) in hexane is added to deactivate a portion of the Sn sites. The amount of TEA mixture (0.016 M in hexane) added ranges from 0 to 200 μL, correlating to a range of TEA:Sn of 0–1:1, followed by the addition of residual hexane to reach a total of 500 μL of hexane to fully wet the catalyst. Specific amounts are included in the SI in Table S1. This mixture is allowed to stir for twominutes before a 1.5 mL solution of the reaction mixture (0.4 M epichlorohydrin, DGDE, and neat methanol) is added. The initial sample is taken from the pre-mixed solution, and the same procedure for standard catalytic testing is followed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Investigation of fluoride treatment conditions The successful modification of the initial hydrophilic nano-zeolite framework is accomplished through investigating several different post-synthesis treatment parameters, including the fluoride source, temperature, and time. Using a method reported to treat MFI with ammonium fluoride (NH4F) [32] as a basis, systematic optimization experiments are used to identify treatment conditions that result in the greatest increase of the nano-Sn-Beta’s hydrophobicity, as measured through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Further discussion of these tests is reported in the Supporting Information S2. The optimal conditions for the fluoride treatment are 1 M solution of TEAF (9 mL of solution per gram zeolite) at 140°C for 72 h to treat the calcined material. These conditions are used for the remainder of this work. 3.2 Material synthesis and characterization A large batch of nano-Sn-Beta is treated for 72 h at 140 °C and further characterized. Initially from PXRD in Fig. S5, it is observed that the treatment is sufficiently mild to preserve the crystallinity of the material. Interestingly, the diffraction peaks of the treated materials have a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) than the untreated materials. As the peak FWHM is inversely correlated with particle size, it is possible that the fluoride treatment may cause recrystallization of the nano-sized zeolite to larger dimensions that could result in diffusion limitations during catalysis [45,46]. The Scherrer’s equation is used to estimate the crystallite size of the materials, as shown in Table 1 . The particle size before and after treatment is determined to be 25 and 32 nm, respectively. SEM images, as shown in Fig. S6, reveal minimal change in the size and morphology in the berry-like clusters of nano-Sn-Beta before and after treatment. These results indicate that the treatment did not significantly affect the size of the particles. The retention of highly crystalline materials observed by XRD is corroborated by the nitrogen physisorption data, as shown in Fig. 1 . All materials display a similar isotherm with a large uptake in the microporous region between a P/P0 of 0 and 0.1. The untreated nano-Sn-Beta appears to have the largest nitrogen physisorption, which could indicate the presence of defect voids artificially increasing the porosity of the crystal. After fluoride treatment, this uptake is significantly reduced, resulting in a reduced BET surface area and t-plot micropore volume (Table 1), suggesting that defects in the framework are being removed. Both nano materials display a small hysteresis in the P/P0 range of 0.5–1.0, which has typically been attributed to the agglomeration of the nanomaterials creating intraparticle voids [47]. When comparing the micropore volume of nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF to conventional Sn-Beta, it is observed that the treated material has a slightly lower micropore volume than conventional Sn-Beta, but this difference is minor. The pore size distribution of the materials are reported in Fig. S15. Conventional Sn-Beta contains a narrow distribution of sites around 7–8 Å consistent with the Beta framework [48]. Nano-Sn-Beta contains these similar pores, and it also contain pores around 5–6 Å, 12 Å, and 300 Å. After treatment, the 12 Å group of pores are removed while the amount 7–8 Å pores increases. This is consistent with the larger defect areas being transformed into the typical zeolite Beta pore dimensions. These materials are characterized using elemental analysis to investigate how the fluoride treatment impacts the tin incorporation. As indicated in Table 1, elemental analysis of the materials reveals that the materials have ∼0.9 wt% Sn. This weight percent is converted to a Si:Sn, and it is found that all materials have a similar Si:Sn of ∼220:1. This indicates that the fluoride treatment does not significantly alter the Si:Sn. Although the fluoride treatment dissolves some of the silica from the framework, the dissolution does not impact the composition. Overall, these techniques show that the fluoride treatment preserves the crystallinity and porosity for the zeolite Beta framework, but it is important to use other techniques to characterize the effect of fluoride treatment on hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity of these materials is determined using thermogravimetric analysis to measure the amount of adsorbed water. As shown in Fig. 2 , conventional Sn-Beta displays a characteristic hydrophobic framework with a near 1% loss of mass from 25 − 150 °C, a temperature range associated with desorption of water. Untreated nano-Sn-Beta displays a much greater mass loss of 16%. After the treatment, the mass loss of nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF is much lower, about 3%, indicating the treatment significantly modifies the hydrophobicity of our material. Water adsorption experiments are performed on these materials to further characterize their hydrophobicity. The water adsorption isotherms collected at room temperature display a similar trend to that of TGA. Specifically, Sn-Beta is determined to have limited uptake of water whereas nano-Sn-Beta has more water adsorption. Treating nano-Sn-Beta with TEAF results in a material nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF that has limited water adsorption, but nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF has more water adsorption than Sn-Beta. This is consistent with nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF having a greater external surface area with hydrophilic surface silanols than Sn-Beta. The change in hydrophobicity is attributed to the reduction in silanol content, as demonstrated using FTIR and 29Si NMR. As shown in Fig. S7, untreated nano-Sn-Beta exhibits a broad peak from 3600 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1 that is commonly associated with hydrogen bonding of water by silanols. Upon treatment, the broad peak diminishes greatly, indicating the removal of silanols in the material and a decrease in the amount of bonded water stabilized by silanol nests. Both TGA and FTIR confirm the large reduction in the amount of adsorbed water after treating nano-Sn-Beta with fluoride. The effects of the fluoride treatment are further investigated using 29Si DP MAS to quantify the different types of silicon atoms throughout the materials. As shown in Fig. 3 , the spectra are composed of three resonances at −93, −102, and −111 ppm, corresponding to Q2, Q3, and Q4 sites, respectively [49]. Untreated nano-Sn-Beta exhibits a significant amount of Q2 sites and a large Q3/Q4 ratio (ϕQ3/Q4 = 0.49), indicating a high presence of silanols. After TEAF treatment, there is near complete removal of Q2 sites and a much lower Q3/Q4 ratio (ϕQ3/Q4 = 0.14) is observed. Lower Q2 and Q3 signals indicate removal of defects, although these peaks remain higher in nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF than Sn-Beta (ϕQ3/Q4 = 0.015). This could be attributed to the larger surface area/volume of the nanoparticles, leading to more terminal silanols on the external surface. After treatment, the peak for Q4 sites for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF is narrowed compared to the untreated nano-Sn-Beta, consistent with a structured and crystalline framework. 29Si CP MAS is also used to measure silicon atoms in near proximity to protons, displayed in Fig. S8. Whereas this is not a quantitative measurement, the supported conclusions remain the same, and the higher signal to noise ratio in nano-Sn-Beta provides evidence for a large number of protons from adsorbed water and silanols residing throughout the hydrophilic material. Overall, the 29Si NMR results are consistent with a large reduction in the number of silanol defects in nano-Sn-Beta from the fluoride treatment. In addition to the reaction environment, it is important to characterize the nature of the catalytic Lewis acid site using DRUVS and DRIFTS. First, the materials are characterized using DRUVS to determine if the synthesis method produces detectable quantities of extra-framework SnO2 that can be identified by a peak at 290 nm, as shown in Fig. S9. Similar to our previous work [36], the spectra for both Sn-Beta and nano-Sn-Beta lack any peak at 290 nm. Additionally, the DRUVS spectra for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF also lacks a peak at 290 nm, indicating that the fluoride treatment did not cause the tin in the material to form detectable amounts of tin oxide clusters. Second, the effect of the treatment on catalytic Sn sites is investigated using DRIFTS analysis of the materials with deuterated acetonitrile as a probe molecule. This technique probes the catalytic sites and provides information about the different type of acid sites, including open Sn sites (2316 cm−1), closed Sn sites (2308 cm−1), and silanols (2278 cm−1) [23]. As shown in Fig. S10, the defective nano-Sn-Beta is found to have a large silanol peak that overshadows the Sn sites. This silanol peak is two orders of magnitude greater in both nano-Sn-Beta samples compared to the conventional Sn-Beta samples at similar CD3CN dosing. Although the two Sn peaks overlap, the data can be deconvoluted to determine the ratio of open and closed sites for the zeolite beta catalyst. Deconvolution of the data for nano-Sn-Beta indicates an open:closed of 0.49:1. Upon fluoride treatment, it is found that the ratio becomes 0.21:1 for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF. The shift towards 2308 cm−1 indicates that defects in the original material may reside near Sn atoms and are healed by the fluoride treatment. 3.3 Kinetic testing The catalytic performance is evaluated using two different epoxide ring opening (ERO) reactions. The first reaction involves the ring opening of epichlorohydrin with methanol. In our previous work [43], this reaction has been used to compare the catalytic performance of a broad range of mesoporous and microporous materials because it has been speculated that the small substrate size would experience limited to no internal mass transfer limitations. The second reaction involves the ring opening of 1,2-epoxyhexane with ethanol. For this reaction, our previous work demonstrates that internal mass transfer limitations are present for Sn-Beta, but the use of nano-zeolites such as nano-Sn-Beta could mitigate internal mass transfer limitations [35,36]. Combining the information from both of the reactions, catalyst performance can be analyzed apart from diffusion limitations, gathering data about the inherent active Sn site and impact of nearby chemical environment. Comparing the catalytic activity in these two reactions with nano-Sn-Beta and fluoride-treated nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF can provide information about the effect of hydrophobicity of the framework on the intrinsic activity of catalyst. First, the activity of the treated and untreated nano-Sn-Beta is compared with conventional Sn-Beta for epichlorohydrin ring opening with methanol, as shown in Fig. 4 . Similar to our previous work, Sn-Beta catalyzes the ring opening of epichlorohydrin with methanol, achieving high conversion of epichlorohydrin in 4 h. Additionally, Sn-Beta catalyzes the reaction with high regioselectivity of 97% for the terminal ether based on analysis of the 4-hour sample with GC-FID. Our previous work demonstrated that GC-FID analysis is consistent with the selectivity determined from 1H NMR [43]. This high regioselectivity is observed for all catalyst testing, indicating that the regioselectivity is not affected by the zeolite framework hydrophobicity. This also indicates that no Brønsted acid sites are introduced as our previous work demonstrates that Brønsted acid sites result in a different regioselectivity [43]. In our previous work, untreated nano-Sn-Beta is also evaluated for catalytic activity for the ring opening of epichlorohydrin with methanol. Based on the similarity of the conversion after 15 min of nano-Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta, it has been concluded that the reaction between epichlorohydrin and methanol is not diffusion limited under the reaction conditions. The data have been used to calculate the reaction rate constant using a first order model and are reported in Table 2 . From this analysis, it is determined that nano-Sn-Beta has a reaction rate constant of 0.59 hr−1 whereas Sn-Beta is found to have a reaction rate constant of 0.83 hr−1. These results would suggest that the reaction of epichlorohydrin with methanol is not diffusion limited under these reaction conditions, but it is unexpected that the larger crystals of Sn-Beta have a higher reaction rate constant than nano-Sn-Beta for these reaction conditions. A few potential causes of the observed difference could be (1) differences in the framework hydrophobicity, (2) residual fluorine affecting the catalytic site, or (3) differences in the number of catalytically active sites. These differences would originate based on the differences in how the materials are synthesized. Sn-Beta is produced in the presence of fluoride and results in a hydrophobic zeolite whereas nano-Sn-Beta is produced in the presence of hydroxide ions as the mineralizing agent that results in a hydrophilic zeolite. Although other reactions have been shown to be susceptible to the solvation environment [15–17,41], it is not clear how the reaction environment could impact the epoxide ring opening with an alcohol. Also, these synthesis conditions could produce materials with a different fraction of sites that are catalytically active. It will be important to examine these factors as potential explanations for the observed differences. The effect of the framework hydrophobicity can be evaluated by determining the catalytic activity of nano-Sn-Beta after the fluoride treatment. For epichlorohydrin ring opening with methanol, the use of nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF results in a 90% increase in performance relative to untreated nano-Sn-Beta, as shown in Fig. 4. From fitting the data to a first order model, it is determined that the reaction rate constant is 1.2 hr−1. Indeed, healing silanol defects in the material and increasing the catalyst’s hydrophobicity significantly increases its activity for the ERO reaction. Interestingly, it is unexpected that nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF also has a higher reaction rate constant than conventional Sn-Beta. These small molecules are thought to be able to freely diffuse through the material and to not be affected by mass transfer limitations. These results make it necessary to perform additional tests to determine the total fraction of catalytic sites of these materials. These catalysts do however all produce the same regioselectivity of 97% at each time point, indicating that the reaction mechanisms are likely similar and that no Brønsted acid sites are introduced. The increase in activity after treatment suggests the ERO reaction benefits from a hydrophobic reaction environment. This is further supported by the fact that these catalysts have similar apparent activation enthalpies, which are calculated through a Polanyi plot and are indistinguishable within error, as seen in Table 2. It is determined that the entropic effects are the predominant cause of the change in activity. A similar result is repored for different reactions in which hydrophobic environments around the active sites can play a role in stabilizing/destabilizing reaction intermediates and solvent networks [15–17]. When determining how the treatment is causing the increase in activity for nano-Sn-Beta, it is important to investigate whether the fluoride treatment maintained nano-Sn-Beta as small particles to facilitate the conversion of bulky substrates. The performance of the catalysts for the bulky substrates is evaluated for the ring opening of 1,2-epoxyhexane with ethanol. These large molecules diffuse slowly through the small 12-member ring micropores of Sn-Beta, resulting in conversion over time that is impacted by internal mass transfer. The diffusion limitations are observed primarily in the conventional Sn-Beta where the products become occluded in the pores of the catalyst (confirmed through TGA of used catalyst and observation of combusted organics) [43]. It is found that Sn-Beta initially converts 1,2-epoxyhexane at a moderate rate and only achieves a conversion of the epoxide of 40% in 4 h, as shown in Fig. 5 . It is determined that the regioselectivity for the terminal ether is 60%. This regioselectivity is observed for all materials over each time period, indicating that the reaction environment does not affect the regioselectivity. For the nano-zeolites, it is determined that nano-Sn-Beta is able to achieve an epoxide conversion of ∼90% in that same time period, demonstrating that reducing the particle size serves to mitigate diffusion limitations for these materials. Interestingly, it is observed that nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF has a higher catalytic activity than Sn-Beta and nano-Sn-Beta. Indeed, nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF is able to achieve ∼90% conversion in only 2 h. The observed differences in catalytic activity supports the observation that the framework hydrophobicity affects the observed reaction rate. Additionally, these results indicate that the fluoride treatment is sufficiently mild so that the small particle size is maintained. The magnitude of the effect of the framework hydrophobicity can be calculated once the fraction of tin sites that are catalytically active is determined and the effects of residual fluorine have been investigated. 3.4 Analysis of residual fluorine One possible cause of the difference in activity after treatment could be from fluorine left in the framework after treatment. Although calcination is thought to remove most fluorine species, there is a possibility that it could still be bound to the framework, especially as Sn-F species that could influence the materials catalytic activity. 19F NMR is used to measure fluorine species on the materials, shown in Fig. 6 . Nano-Sn-Beta is synthesized without any fluorine present, and the signal shown is from fluorine background (predominantly from rotor cap and epoxy resin in the probe). Sn-Beta reveals similar levels of background, indicating there is little residual fluorine from the hydrothermal synthesis that is detectable through NMR. Nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF however does contain several lineshapes (and spinning sidebands), revealing that not all the fluorine is removed from calcination. Two tests are performed to measure the possible effect of the residual fluorine on catalytic activity. First, a pure silica nano-Si-Beta is treated similarly with TEAF and tested for epoxide ring opening with ECH and methanol. Both before and after treatment, the pure silica nano-Si-Beta shows negligible conversion of the epoxide. The result indicates that F species bound to Si seem to have little effect on catalytic activity, but this does not rule out the possibility of Sn-F species. The second experiment involves an ion-exchange washing step with NMe4OH, reported in previous literature, to remove residual fluorine [50–52]. After washing nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF with NMe4OH, the material is analyzed using 19F NMR to reveal no detectable F species. The nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF-NMe4OH is tested for epoxide ring opening with ECH and methanol. After the washing step, the material is shown to have no significant difference in activity compared to nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF, as shown in Fig. S14. These results show that residual fluorine species left over from the fluoride treatment are not the cause of the dramatic increase in catalytic activity. 3.5 Quantification of the fraction of active catalytic sites The increase in the observed catalytic activity after the treatment could also possibly be associated with the change in the number of sites. As the amount of catalyst required to achieve an epoxide:Sn of 250:1 is based on elemental analysis, it is possible that tin exists in the zeolite as tin oxide that had been demonstrated to have limited to no catalytic activity for epoxide ring opening [35]. The fraction of tin sites that are catalytically active is quantified using site poisoning experiments. These experiments involve adding triethylamine (TEA) as a Lewis base to deactivate the Lewis acid Sn sites. As the amount of TEA poison added increases towards a 1:1 molar ratio of TEA:Sn, the activity of the catalysts would theoretically decrease linearly towards zero, assuming that all sites have the same activity. In some cases, heterogeneous catalysts tend to have a distribution of the type of sites with different activities, which the site quantification experiments can help to elucidate. Initially, the site quantification experiments are performed through adding TEA in methanol. A control experiment is first performed in the presence of TEA without catalyst, showing around 1% conversion of epichlorohydrin after 24 h. Since the TEA poison exhibits negligible conversion, the changes in catalytic activity can be attributed specifically to modifications of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. S11, it is observed that the TOF for nano-Sn-Beta decreases proportional to the amount of poison added to the reaction mixture. It is noted that the selectivity of the reaction does not change with the addition of triethylamine, suggesting that there is not a new reaction pathway introduced. At a TEA:Sn of 1:1, the catalyst is still able to ring open the epoxide, suggesting that the TEA may be competing for Lewis acid sites with the methanol used as the solvent. Indeed, the catalyst remains active until a TEA:Sn of 1.3:1, at which point the activity becomes negligible compared to the baseline reaction without catalyst. It is hypothesized that methanol is able to compete with the TEA to bind to the Sn sites, which remain active beyond stoichiometric poisoning. The competitive binding of methanol and TEA is overcome through introducing the TEA as the poison diluted in hexane. The TEA poison is allowed to mix with the catalyst in hexane before addition of the reaction mixture containing the epoxide, methanol, and internal standard. Using hexane as the solvent for TEA, the site poisoning experiments are repeated for a range of TEA:Sn. These experiments are used to calculate the initial turnover frequency (TOF0). The TOF0 is divided by the TOF0 determined with no TEA (TOF0 (0:1)), giving the normalized TOF0, as shown in Fig. 7 . It is determined that the normalized TOF0 decreases linearly proportional to the amount of TEA added. Interestingly, the normalized TOF0 decreases to approximately zero when a TEA:Sn of 1:1 is tested. Further additions of poison do not affect catalytic activity, up to TEA:Sn of 1.3:1, as shown in Fig. S12. This result suggests that all Sn species in nano-Sn-Beta are active for alcohol ring opening of the epoxide. Additionally, the linear decrease suggests that either (a) TEA does not selectively bind to open or closed sites or (b) open and closed sites have similar activity. Future work will address these issues, which are considered beyond the scope of this current paper. The site quantification experiments are repeated for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF and Sn-Beta. The results for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF are similar to the nano-Sn-Beta results. The similarity indicates that the treatment procedure is mild and serves to reduce silanol defects without causing formation of catalytically inactive or inaccessible species. This indicates that the differences observed in catalytic activity for both ring opening of epichlorohydrin and 1,2-epoxyhexane are associated with the zeolite framework hydrophobicity. Indeed, it appears that the epoxide ring opening reaction in zeolites benefits from a hydrophobic zeolite framework. Whereas both nano-Sn-Beta materials have 100% of the Sn as active when synthesized at a ratio of 200:1 of Si:Sn, the site quantification experiments for Sn-Beta appear different for this similar Si:Sn ratio. The normalized TOF0 decreases linearly as the TEA:Sn is increased. However, it is observed that the normalized TOF0 decreases towards zero before a TEA:Sn of 1:1. Fitting the normalized TOF0 with a line, it is found that in Sn-Beta approximately 72% of sites are active. The remaining fraction of sites appear inactive potentially because they are either inaccessible or inactive tin species, which could include SnO2. Although SnO2 is not detected using DRUVS, as shown in Fig. S9, it is possible that this spectroscopic technique is not sufficiently sensitive when analyzing materials with high Si:Sn and potentially small SnO2 clusters. Using the site quantification results for all materials, it is possible to investigate differences observed in the catalytic activity. For methanol ring opening of epichlorohydrin, the catalytic activity is observed to be highest for nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF followed by conventional Sn-Beta. When considering the fraction of catalytic sites for Sn-Beta to be 0.72, it is found that the TOF0 for both Sn-Beta and nano-Sn-Beta treated with TEAF are identical (TOF0 of 288 hr−1 and TOF0 of 287 hr−1 for Sn-Beta and nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF, respectively). This is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that the reaction of epichlorohydrin with methanol is not mass transfer limited under the reaction conditions studied. These tests overall support the conclusion that the significant increase in activity of nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF is caused by the increased hydrophobicity resulting from the post-synthetic fluoride treatment. 4 Summary The post-synthetic treatment of nano-Sn-Beta with tetraethylammonium fluoride in water transforms the nano-zeolite by reducing the silanol content to produce a material that is more hydrophobic than the parent nano-zeolite. The procedure is sufficiently mild to preserve the small particle size and crystallinity. The increased hydrophobicity of the treated nano-Sn-Beta-TEAF catalyst is evident through the reduction in percent mass loss from adsorbed water from 17% of the untreated catalyst to 3% for the treated material, as analyzed from TGA. The hydrophobic nano-zeolite is more active than the untreated nano-Sn-Beta, as demonstrated through kinetic testing for epoxide ring opening with alcohols. When using small substrates of methanol and epichlorohydrin, the treated catalyst shows a 90% increase in TOF0 (148 hr−1–287 hr−1). Similarly, the treated catalyst displays a similar improvement in activity when testing bulky substrates, epoxyhexane and ethanol, which have diffusion limitations and reduced activity in conventional Sn-Beta. Elemental analysis and poisoning experiments with triethylamine show that the treatment does not affect the number of active sites, and an analysis on residual fluorine indicates that any residual fluorine species do not affect catalytic activity. The improved catalytic performance can therefore be attributed to the enhanced hydrophobic reaction environment through entropic effects. Overall, this post-synthetic treatment could be a valuable technique as it permits for the transformation of the material into a hydrophobic catalyst without affecting the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites.

        "dc:description": "Elucidation of synthesis-structure–reactivity relationships can help to enhance the catalytic performance of zeolites for a broad range of reactions. Considerable focus has been on examining structure–reactivity behavior of the catalytic site, but it has become increasingly evident that molecular interactions beyond the catalytic site in the outer sphere impact catalytic activity. The key challenge is to create synthetic methods that can create well-defined catalytic materials with control over catalytic sites and the catalytic reaction environment. After synthesizing nano-Sn-Beta using a hydrothermal method involving hydroxide ions that produce a hydrophilic material, these materials are treated with tetraethylammonium fluoride (TEAF) using mild conditions to produce a hydrophobic framework while maintaining the small particle size. The fluoride treated material is determined to be more active in the epoxide ring opening reaction than the as-synthesized nano-Sn-Beta (90% increase in TOF0), indicating that a hydrophobic framework is beneficial for the alcohol ring opening of epoxides. This is supported by site quantification experiments and an analysis of residual fluorine, which is found to have limited effect on activity. When accounting for the fraction of active sites, it is demonstrated for the methanol ring opening of epichlorohydrin that all hydrophobic materials are not diffusion limited under the reaction conditions and have the same turnover frequencies, which are higher than the turnover frequency of hydrophilic catalysts. Overall, this work reports a technique to improve the hydrophobicity of zeolite beta and demonstrates the importance of a hydrophobic reaction environment for the alcohol ring opening of epoxides.",
