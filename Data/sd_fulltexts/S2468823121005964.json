Recent efforts in addressing the environmental problems have involved using CO2 as a cheap and nontoxic C1 source. Iridium catalysts with bidentate ligands are excellent catalysts for CO2, especially if these complexes possess proton-responsive OH or NH groups. Here-in we report the synthesis of novel Ir half-sandwich complexes with N^N bidentate tetrazolyl ligands. Serendipitous deprotection of methoxy groups resulted in N^N bidentate ligands bearing OH groups. The complexes were evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation, for which the roles of steric bulk or the presence of electronic effects influence their catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation. The complexes are highly active for CO2 hydrogenations with around 4.3 mmol of formate produced. The presence of proton responsive groups on the catalysts was found to steer the mechanistic cycle away from using a bridged Ir-H-Ir intermediate before forming catalytically active species. In addition, these catalysts were found to hydrogenate CO2 in the presence of bicarbonate ions selectively. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Tetrazole Proton-responsive Iridium(III) complexes CO2 Hydrogenation 1 Introduction Carbon capture and sequestration have been noted as an avenue for lowering the amount of CO2 in the environment. However, this approach has only been feasible to store only around 4.7 MtCO2/year in five projects across the globe [1,2]. Constraint to capturing and sequestration of CO2 as avenues for mitigating the rising levels of CO2 in the environment include the high costs involved in isolating and storing the gas and the unpredictability of the environmental impacts of long-term storage of large amounts of CO2 on natural systems [1,3–5]. Due to these reasons, CO2 capture and sequestration have not taken effective hold as the preferred mode of addressing the environmental impact of rising CO2 levels [3]. The utilization or conversion of CO2, which is thermodynamically stable, into value-added products has become an interesting research area. [1,6,7] The conversion and recycling of CO2 instead of its storage or disposal is an attractive proposition, especially if industrial processes exist to convert CO2 to useful products [8,9]. Converting CO2 to value-added products would serve as an avenue to recycle carbon, simultaneously reducing the levels of fossil-fuel extraction and its subsequent pollution, in turn preserving limited resources and reducing our dependence on non-renewable resources. Therefore, current attempts have been aimed at the design and development of catalysts capable of activating CO2 [1,3,10–12]. One class of effective catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation are iridium half-sandwich complexes. They have been shown to demonstrate impressive catalytic for both the CO2 hydrogenation and formic acid dehydrogenation [13–18]. A variety of factors have been shown to influence the catalytic activity of iridium half-sandwich complexes for CO2 hydrogenation. Designing iridium catalysts with enhanced electron-donating effect, second sphere coordination effects, and the use of electron-rich N-based ligands has resulted in the preparation of highly active iridium half-sandwich complexes for CO2 hydrogenation. In addition, the presence of a base is generally required to improve the enthalpy of CO2 hydrogenation or to consume the formic acid as it is being generated to form formate, in effect shifting the equilibrium forward [19]. In other case the base has been required in order to accelerate the H2 heterolysis in effect kinetically promoting the catalytic activity [11,20–22]. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and kinetic isotopic experiments (KIE) indicates water plays a vital role for these classes of catalysts especially as it resulted in the formation of Iridium-aqua complexes as the resting state for the catalyst. The catalytic cycle for various iridium half-sandwich complexes with chloride ligands thus involves the hydrolyses of Iridium‑chloro complexes in order to form the iridium aqua analogues in situ [23]. Himeda and co-workers report a classic example of an iridium half-sandwich complex used for CO2 hydrogenation [24]. Using 4‑hydroxy-N-methylpicolinamidate as the ligand, CO2 could be efficiently hydrogenated even under ambient conditions (0.1 MPa, 25 °C) in basic water. This catalytic system generated a TON of 14 700 and TOF of 167 h−1, resulting in a concentrated 0.64 M formate solution. This high catalytic activity was attributed to the increased electron donation from the anionic amide moiety and the oxyanion moiety. From this work, Kanega et al. [24] demonstrated that non-aromatic imidazoline moieties were more efficient ligands than aromatic imidazole moieties. This was as a result of the restricted delocalization of π-electrons within the amidine moieties. From DFT calculations, the proposed mechanism for the mode of action for these catalytic systems involved the binding of H2 to a vacant site on the Iridium center after dissociation of an aqua ligand. This is then followed by direct H2 heterolysis using amide as the proton acceptor, resulting in forming the Iridium hydride (Ir−H) intermediate. The presence of hydroxyl groups that deprotonate under basic conditions results in strongly electron-donating oxyanion groups. In addition to others such as NH [25], this oxyanion group has been shown to contribute towards dihydrogen activation and cleavage through second sphere coordination effects leading to the formation of the catalytically active iridium hydride species during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction [26–28]. DFT and KIE experiments confirmed direct heterolysis as the preferred route of formation over an H2O or HCO3 − assisted H2 heterolysis. The final steps for the mechanism then involve an electrophilic attack by CO2 on the Iridium hydride species to yield an iridium formate (Ir−OCHO) intermediate that undergoes dissociation of formate to regenerate the catalyst [24]. However, in contrast to several instances where the formation of an iridium hydride species is the rate-limiting step [26,27,29], the rate-limiting step for iridium catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation can also be the step involving the insertion of CO2 into the iridium-hydride bond [30]. Interestingly, for an N^C bidentate iridium half-sandwich complex used for CO2 hydrogenation [31], UV–VIS characterization, as well as NMR spectral evidence after hydrogenation, indicated the catalyst changes the catalysts cycle, from an N^C bidentate Iridium complex to a C^C bidentate iridium complex after the reaction [31]. Similar observations have been reported in the literature for cyclometalation of bidentate NHC-pyridine ligands involving iridium, rhodium, gold, palladium and platinum [32–34]. Such changes in catalysts structure before and after CO2 hydrogenation could be a result of inherent iridium-heteroatom bond weakness in catalysts designs. In N^N bidentate bibenzimidazole iridium half-sandwich complexes reported by Yoon et al. [35] for CO2 hydrogenation, a crystal structure of the complex indicated a longer Ir–N (2.127 °A) and Ir–Cp* (1.789 °A) bond length as compared to [Cp*Ir(Bpy)Cl]Cl [26] which had Ir- N and Ir–Cp* of 2.076 °A and 1.785 °A respectively. These extended bond length for Ir–N and Ir–Cp* was attributed to the steric bulk of the bibenzimidazole ligand as compared to pyridine. Thus weaker Ir–N and Ir–Cp* bond interactions were expected for the N^N bidentate bibenzimidazole iridium half-sandwich complex, which in turn might lead to dissociation and result in structural instability under CO2 hydrogenation conditions. 2 Results and discussions 2.1 Synthesis and characterization of proton responsive tetrazole-based ligand Synthesis of 1 (Scheme 1) was achieved by first reacting the aryl nitrile with a slight excess of NaN3 and an excess of Et3N.HCl (triethylamine hydrochloride salt) in toluene under elevated temperatures. However, in contrast to the procedure for the formation of 2-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyridine, 2‑methoxy-6-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyridine (1) does not precipitate from solution upon acidifying the reaction mixture with HCl(aq) [36]. In attempts to isolate 1, the resulting acidified solution was heated at 100 °C under vacuum to remove excess toluene and HCl(aq). Interestingly, over 6 h, an orange gel formed, the addition of distilled water to this gel immediately resulted in the precipitation of a white solid. Characterization of this precipitate indicated 2 had been inadvertently synthesized via this procedure. The ligand 2 was obtained in good yields as a white solid and is air and moisture stable. In addition, it is soluble in DMSO while being insoluble in organic solvents such as DCM and being insoluble in water. 1H NMR characterization of 2 indicated only slight signal shifts in proton signals of around 0.1–0.2 ppm compared to the 1H NMR spectrum of 6-methoxypicolinonitrile. In addition, there is an observed disappearance of the peak corresponding to the methoxy protons of 6-methoxypicolinonitrile. The elemental analysis also confirmed the formation of tetrazole ring since the nitrogen content of 2 (42.93%) is significantly different from the nitrogen content of 6-methoxypicolinonitrile (20.88%). In order to obtain 1, instead of acidifying the reaction mixture after completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated off, yielding a mixture of 1, NaN3, and Et3N.HCl. DCM was then added to remove the excess NaN3 and Et3N.HCl. Subsequently, drying the filtrate and dissolving it in diethyl ether caused any dissolved Et3N.HCl to precipitate. Drying this diethyl ether filtrate and washing the dried filtrate with toluene yielded 1, albeit in poor yield. Compound 1 is a white solid and is both air and moisture stable soluble in various solvents such as DMSO, chloroform, and water. 1H NMR characterization of 1 indicated signal shifts in proton signals of around 0.1–0.2 ppm compared to the 1H NMR spectrum of 6-methoxypicolinonitrile. In addition, the elemental analysis also confirmed the formation of tetrazole ring since the nitrogen content of 1 (35.17%) is significantly different from the nitrogen content of 6-methoxypicolinonitrile (20.88%). Interestingly, selective alkylation of 2 or 1 with a tert‑butyl group was achieved using a mixture of tert‑butanol in perchloric acid (Scheme 1). This resulted in 3 and 4, which were obtained as white solids in excellent yield. Ligands 3 and 4 are soluble in organic solvents such as DCM and THF while being insoluble in water. Confirmation of the presence of the alkyl group in both 3 and 4 was provided by 1H NMR spectroscopy, for which a signal around 1.7 ppm integrating for 9 protons was observed. This selective alkylation of the Nb position on the tetrazole ring in 2 ( Scheme 1 ), similar to that observed in 2-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyridine, is possible because, in the presence of excess perchloric acid, there is protonation of the oxygen atom on the hydroxyl group, the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring as well as nitrogen d of the tetrazole ring. This results in delocalization of charge between positions a, e, and d . With this delocalization of charge, only two equivalent positions, b, and c as available sites for attack by the tertbutyl group [37]. As such, alkylation of b or c yields the same products as rotamers since rotation along the CC bond between the pyridine and tetrazole rings occurs in compounds 3 and 4. 2.2 Synthesis and characterization of tetrazolyl iridium complexes Synthesis of the chloro substituted complexes 5–7 (Scheme 2) was achieved by reacting the appropriate ligands in a 2:1 ratio with [Ir(C5Me5)Cl2]2 in DCM over 24 h. These complexes were obtained as yellowish solids in good yield and soluble in most organic solvents such as DCM and CHCl3. 1H NMR characterization served to indicate complexation since significant shifts of around 0.5 ppm were observed compared to the 1H NMR spectrum of the ligands. 1H NMR spectra of the complexes 5–7 indicated rotamers were not formed in contrast to the presence of rotamers in 3 or 4. As a result of the bulkiness of the tert‑butyl group, the obtained compound would be reasonably expected to be the less sterically hindered complexes 5–7. In addition, aside from steric bulk, it has also been demonstrated by both experimental and quantum-chemical calculations of 2-monosubstituted tetrazoles [38,39] that the most preferable coordinating nitrogen in the tetrazole ring is N-5. The reaction of the chloro substituted complex 5 with Ag2SO4 as halide abstractor in water yielded new aqua complexes 8. The chloride ligands' substitution was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy for which changes of around 0.2 ppm were observed. The formation of aqua complexes is in contrast to other reported cases of halide abstraction using Ag2SO4 in water for N^N Iridium‑chloro substituted systems for which sulfato complexes have been formed [40]. The presence of an aqua ligand was confirmed by reacting either 8 with NaPF6 and the products analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. After confirmation of counter ion exchange by 13P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, a near-identical 1H NMR spectrum was obtained as compared to 8. This is contrary to what will be expected and has been observed in 1H NMR spectra of similar systems due to different electronic properties due to coordination of either the sulfato or aqua group. However, in aqueous solutions, equilibration between 8 and 8a may also be expected to take place. The reaction of the aqua complexes with excess HCOONa followed by a counter ion exchange [41] with NaPF6 resulted in the new metal hydride species 9. The presence of the hydride ligand was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, for which there was a peak around −11 ppm integrating for one proton (Fig. 1 ). Similarly, 13P{1H} NMR spectrum indicated the presence of the PF6 counterion. 2.3 Evaluation of complexes 5–9 for CO2 hydrogenation The iridium complexes 5–9 were evaluated for catalytic activity in hydrogenating CO2 at 160 °C in 10 mL of water, under 50 bar CO2:H2 (1:2) using 3.55 mmol K2CO3 at 5 µmol catalyst loading for 24 h at 1500 rpm (Table). Under these conditions, 5 yielded 2.95 mmol of formate, resulting in a conversion of 42%. Using 8, which possessed aqua ligands, conversions further increased, yielding 4.336 mmol of product with a conversion of 61%. This increased activity is due to the ease of dissociation of the aqua ligand in 8, yielding a vacant site before forming the iridium hydride species compared to 5. However, a drop in conversion from 61% to 16% was observed when isolated iridium hydride 9 was used in CO2 hydrogenation under identical conditions as those used for 8. This reduced activity is primarily due to the solubility of these complexes in water affected by the presence of PF6 counter ions. For catalysts 5 and 8, both catalytically active hydride species are soluble in water since the chloride and sulfato counter ions still result in intermediates that remain soluble in water throughout hydrogenation. The influence of the counterion is apparent when water-soluble iridium hydride species were observed in situ by 1H NMR spectroscopy. By pressurizing 5 mg of 5 in D2O solution containing 10 mg of NaOH with 10 MPa H2, the hydride peak was observed in the 1HNMR spectrum. Furthermore, in the synthesis of 9, before product precipitation from water using KPF6, the hydrido compound with chloro counterion remains soluble in water. Thus, the presence of the PF6 counterion in 9 results in reduced solubility of various intermediates in water since 9 is not soluble in water. By reducing the catalyst loading for 5 (Table 1 , entry 8), significantly higher TONs of around 3000 can be observed in reported ranges for similar proton responsive N^N bidentate iridium half sandwich complexes (Table 1, entries 17–19). By varying the base to DBU, a high base conversion of around 80% can be obtained using 5 for CO2 hydrogenation compared to around 11% for similar systems [20]. Similarly, high catalytic activity is observed when the base is changed to triethylamine with TON around 5000. Varying the ratios of CO2 and H2, it is observed that lowering the amount of H2 present during catalysis results in lowered TON (Table 1, entry 11 and 12). In varying the temperature from 120 °C to 160 °C, there is an increase in catalytic activity with increase in temperature until around 160 °C where catalytic activity reduces suggesting there may be higher product decomposition at this higher temperature resulting in lower TON. Similar observations are made when monitoring reaction time for which extending the reaction time results in lower product formation probably as a result of formate decomposition. Reactions performed in duplicates in 10 mL of H2O, 3.55 mmol K2CO3 at 160 °C under 50 bar CO2:H2 (1:2) with stirring (1500 rpm) in the presence of a precatalyst (5 µmol) for 24 h.

When entries 1 and 6 are compared, it is evident that introducing the proton responsive OH group resulted in enhanced catalytic activity yielding double the mmol of formate produced. Similar observations have been reported in the literature documenting the increased activity provided by pendant OH groups, either as electron-donating groups or by assisting in hydrogen heterolysis before forming the iridium hydride active species. However, by using an iridium catalyst with a protected hydroxyl group (entry 6), conversions are reduced from 42% to 10%. Interestingly, removing the methoxy group completely from 6 to 5a results in an increased conversion from 10% to 20%. Despite the increased electron donation provided by the methoxy group in 6 by the inductive effect, (evidenced in its 1H NMR spectrum with the pyridyl peaks generally upfield in 6 compared to those peaks in 5a), it is plausible that catalytic activity may be reduced due to the increased steric bulk of the methoxy group close to the iridium center inhibiting or slowing the formation rates of various intermediates in the catalytic cycle. With 7 (entry 4) for hydrogenating CO2, a conversion of 14% is obtained compared to its analog 6, which was able to convert 10% of base. This slightly increased catalytic activity suggests the negatively charged tetrazolyl group is preferred for catalytic activity instead of bulky tert‑butyl groups. The negatively charged tetrazolyl moiety may function as a proton responsive group in the presence of hydrogen due to rearrangement of double bonds in the tetrazolyl ring resulting in the coordinating nitrogen atom that coordinates to iridium being either negatively charged or neutral in the various stages of the catalytic cycle. As such, upon dissociation of the chloride ligand in 7 (where coordinating tetrazolyl nitrogen is negatively charged), subsequent heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen results in an iridium hydride species forming with the second atom of hydrogen adding onto the tetrazolyl ring (resulting in coordinating tetrazolyl nitrogen being neutral). This versatility in changing the charge of the coordinating tetrazolyl nitrogen for tetrazole to serve as a proton responsive moiety may be responsible for the observed higher catalytic activity in 7 instead of increased electron donation afforded by the presence of a tert‑butyl group in 6. In attempts to confirm whether formate observed is formed directly from CO2 hydrogenation or indirectly (by converting carbonate salts to CO2 and HCO3 − before hydrogenation) by these complexes, K2CO3 was hydrogenated in water using 5 at 160 °C under 33 bar of H2. However, the poor conversion obtained (4%, entry 7) indicates the actual species undergoing hydrogenation is CO2 instead of carbonate or bicarbonate salts that might form in situ in the presence of hydrogen. 2.4 Proposed mechanism for the iridium catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation A plausible reaction mechanism involving 5 as a catalyst precursor is shown in Scheme 3 . When catalyst 5 is dissolved in water in the presence of excess base, the hydroxyl group on the pyridine ring is expected to be deprotonated. Similarly, under these conditions, aquation of the chloro ligand occurs, leading to the formation of 8. This iridium-aqua species is expected to exist in equilibrium with intermediate A upon dissociation of the aqua ligand. As evidenced by the role of the proton responsive group during catalysis, the formation of the iridium hydride C will be expected to take place by an oxyanion-assisted H2 heterolysis. This property of various Ir- N^N bidentate complexes with proton responsive groups assisting in the formation of iridium hydrides have been reported in literature [11,20–22]. Therefore, this will be the most likely route of H2 heterolysis compared to the water or bicarbonate assisted route of H2 heterolysis. In addition, the formation of a bridged iridium-hydride species was not observed before the formation of C. This contrasts with observing a bridged iridium-hydride species when the precatalyst is devoid of the hydroxyl group. When 9 is treated with NaHCO3, no changes were observed in the resulting NMR spectrum. This supports the earlier observation that the true species undergoing hydrogenation was CO2 present in the reaction mixture. In attempts to identify possible intermediates before product formation, 9 (2.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.4 mL DMSO‑d6, pressurized with 13CO2 (20 bar), and heated at 80 °C. Over 36 h, the hydride peak at −11 ppm disappeared, accompanied by approximately 0.4 ppm shifts downfield in the pyridyl protons signals (Figure SI-1). In addition, a new signal at 159 ppm was observed in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum (Figure SI-2) (reaction of 9 with 13CO2 were carried out at low concentrations of 9 to identify new peak(s) that appear in 13C{1H} NMR spectrum while reducing overlaps with pyridyl 13C{1H} NMR peaks). These changes suggested forming a new species, possibly species D. Characterization of this intermediate in situ by mass spectrometry (attempts to isolate D by drying of solvent yields 9) indicated a fragment of [M-HCO2]+ with m/z = 546.1841. Similar CO2 insertion into Ir-H bonds have also been observed as the most viable route towards the production of formate by CO2 hydrogenation using various Ir(III) complexes. [11,20] In the last step of the reaction, the formate is expelled from iridium-formato D and subsequently stabilized by K + ions while A is regenerated. 3 Conclusion Proton responsive tetrazolyl iridium complexes with either OH or NH groups were prepared from the accidental deprotection of a methoxy‑substituted or alkylation of tetrazolyl ligand. These iridium precatalysts were evaluated as CO2 hydrogenation precatalysts for which catalytic activity with TON around 8000 and base conversion of 80% was attainable, comparable to some of the most active systems reported in the literature. The role of proton-responsive OH and NH groups on these iridium precatalysts was investigated for CO2 hydrogenation, demonstrating that OH groups were more suitable for proton-assisted heterolytic cleavage of H2. In addition, the role of electron-donating tert‑butyl in enhancing catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is demonstrated. Formation of the catalytically active iridium hydride species was preferably obtained by the proton-assisted route in contrast to the water, bicarbonate, or the iridium-bridged hydride route. The actual species being hydrogenated was observed to be CO2, for which plausible iridium-formato species were identified. 4 Experimental All reactions were carried out in air unless otherwise stated.

This was then followed by addition of the required amount of an appropriate base and pressurizing the resulting solution with the required CO2:H2 ratios. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 1500 rpms at the appropriate temperature for the required time. After completion of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the gasses slowly vented. Follwing this, 0.4 mL of the contents of the reactor were sampled and added to 0.2 mL of D2O and 5µL of DMF (as standard). The amounts and concentration of product (formate) was then calculated by comparing integral ratios between the known mmols of standard and formate peak at 8.3 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of the sample.

        "dc:description": "Recent efforts in addressing the environmental problems have involved using CO2 as a cheap and nontoxic C1 source. Iridium catalysts with bidentate ligands are excellent catalysts for CO2, especially if these complexes possess proton-responsive OH or NH groups. Here-in we report the synthesis of novel Ir half-sandwich complexes with N^N bidentate tetrazolyl ligands. Serendipitous deprotection of methoxy groups resulted in N^N bidentate ligands bearing OH groups. The complexes were evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation, for which the roles of steric bulk or the presence of electronic effects influence their catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation. The complexes are highly active for CO2 hydrogenations with around 4.3 mmol of formate produced. The presence of proton responsive groups on the catalysts was found to steer the mechanistic cycle away from using a bridged Ir-H-Ir intermediate before forming catalytically active species. In addition, these catalysts were found to hydrogenate CO2 in the presence of bicarbonate ions selectively.",
