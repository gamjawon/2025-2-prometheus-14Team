A pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional model of an ideal plug flow reactor under an isothermal regime (450 Â°C) was used for reactor design. A catalyst particle diameter of 3 mm is a compromise size because increasing the size of the catalyst particle leads to a de- crease in the reaction rate because of an internal diffusion limitation, and particles with a smaller diameter cause a large pressure drop. A catalyst bed of 11.5 m 3 was estimated for the target N 2 O conversion of 90% upon the treatment of 30000 m 3 /h of exhaust gas (0.1 mol% N 2 O, 0.005 mol% NO, 0.9 mol% H 2 O, 5 mol% O 2 ) at 450 Â°C and 130 kPa. Key words: nitrous oxide; catalytic decomposition; nitric acid production; emission abatement The catalytic decomposition of N 2 O as a method to lower N 2 O emissions in waste gases has recently attracted an in- creasing amount of attention because of the expected inclu- sion of N 2 O in the greenhouse gas trade. Nitric acid plants have been found to be the largest industrial source of anthro- pogenic N 2 O emissions (worldwide 400 kt N 2 O per year) >1@. Several options are available for N 2 O catalytic decomposition such as: (i) high-temperature catalytic decomposition imme- diately downstream of the ammonia burner, (ii) low-tem- perature N 2 O catalytic decomposition upstream of the tail-gas expander and the NO x emission reduction technology (DeNO x ), and (iii) low-temperature N 2 O catalytic decomposition down- stream of the DeNO x process. In this study, we concentrated on the low-temperature (Â” 450 Â°C) N 2 O catalytic decomposition. There is still a problem to find a catalyst with sufficient activity and stability under real off-gas conditions because of water, oxygen, and NO x inhibi- tion effects >2@. Multicomponent mixed oxides that are pre- pared by the thermal treatment of layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors seem to be good catalyst candidates for this reaction [3â€“5]. This contribution summarizes an estimation of N 2 O abatement when using a catalytic reactor situated down- stream of the DeNO x technology in a nitric acid production unit. Intrinsic kinetic data that was obtained from a laboratory ex- periment concerned with N 2 O decomposition over a K-pro- moted Co-Mn-Al mixed oxide was used for reactor modeling. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation and N 2 O decomposition The Co-Mn-Al (Co:Mn:Al molar ratio of 4:1:1) mixed oxide catalyst containing 1.8 wt% K was prepared by the calcination (500 Â°C) of a coprecipitated LDH precursor. The method of preparation and the characterization of this catalyst have been described in our previous report [4]. N 2 O catalytic decomposition was performed in an integral fixed-bed reactor (internal diameter of 5 mm) at 300â€“450 Â°C Lucie OBALOVÃ� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 816â€“820 and 100â€“265 kPa with a catalyst grain from 0.16 mm to 0.315 mm. The gas composition simulated a real waste gas from HNO 3 production (0.1 mol% N 2 O, 0.005 mol% NO, 0.9 mol% H 2 O, 5 mol% O 2 ) and a space velocity of 20â€“60 L/(gÂ·h) was used. Care was taken to avoid interference with physical transport phenomena. The absence of mass transport limita- tions was confirmed by experiments and by satisfying the four dimensionless criteria published by Kapteijn et al. [6]. Fur- thermore, a flat velocity profile and a negligible axial disper- sion can be assumed because d t /d p Â§ 40 and L/d p Â§ 100 [6], and this justifies using an ideal plug flow reactor to analyze the conversion data. 1.2 Mathematic model A pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional model of an ideal plug flow reactor in an isothermal regime (450 Â°C) was used for the reactor design (Eqs. (1)â€“(5)). The influence of internal and external diffusion is described by the overall effectiveness factor (Eqs. (6)â€“(13)) [7,8]. The influence of external heat transfer on the reaction rate was neglected and the catalyst particle was assumed to be isothermal under the given condi- tions. The first-order rate law was applied to the kinetics of N 2 O decomposition [9].

An increase in reactor pressure from atmospheric pressure to 200 kPa led to an order of magnitude increase in N 2 O conver- sion (not shown). The K content was chosen according to our previous results [4,5]. We found an optimal content for the K Lucie OBALOVÃ� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 816â€“820 promoter corresponding to the highest conversion in the pres- ence of O 2 , H 2 O, and NO x . The kinetic parameters for the 1 st rate law were evaluated by an integral method of the laboratory data and this was used for an estimation of the pilot reactor to lower the N 2 O emissions during HNO 3 production. The textural characterization of the Co-Mn-Al mixed oxide catalyst that was pelletized at 6 MPa, and published in our recent work [13] was also used. Figure 2 shows the mesopore size distribution that was determined by the BJH method from the physical desorption of nitrogen. A well resolved maximum was located at 9 nm and a diffuse and not very distinct maximum at about 2 nm. An example of the effective diffusion coefficient (D eff ) cal- culation, according to Eqs. (11)â€“(13), for the highest catalyst pore radius of 9 nm is shown in Table 1. The contribution of molecular diffusion (D //j ) to the overall N 2 O diffusivity ( D ) can be evidently ignored because of the low N 2 O concentration in the model off-gas and, therefore, Knudsen diffusion prevails in the pores. The effective diffusion coefficient N 2 O (D eff ) is determined only by the dimension of the pore radius and it can be consid- ered independent of the gas composition and pressure under the given conditions. The effect of catalyst pore size on internal and external diffusion is expressed as a dependence of the internal (K) and external effectiveness factor (Bi M / 2 gen ) ) on the catalyst pore radius, as shown in Fig. 3. As expected, both the internal and external effectiveness factors increased with an increase in pore size. However, the values for the external effectiveness factor are one order of magnitude higher than the values for the internal effectiveness factor leading to the con- clusion that the N 2 O decomposition under the conditions ex- amined is hindered by internal diffusion in the catalyst pores.

Lucie OBALOVÃ� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 816â€“820 shapes, calculated according to Eqs. (8)â€“(10). A sharp decrease in È˜ with an increase in d p was observed. For the catalyst par- ticles with diameters larger than 3 mm, the overall reaction rate is significantly limited by diffusion in pores, as is evident from the low values of the internal effectiveness factor. A higher value at a given particle diameter was calculated for the particle shapes with a higher volume/external surface ratio. The dependence of the pressure drop on the catalyst particle diameter for the different catalyst shapes is shown in Fig. 5. The pressure drop increases with a lowering of the particle size (leading to an increase in the internal effectiveness factor) and it is also dependent on particle shape. The lowest pressure drop was calculated for the Raschig rings. It is clear that the choice of the catalyst particle size is always a compromise because increasing the size of the catalyst particle leads to a decrease in the reaction rate because of the internal diffusion limitation whereas particles with a smaller diameter cause a large pressure drop. For the N 2 O emissions abatement reactor design, we chose extrudates of 3 mm u 3 mm in dimension. The inlet and cal- culated parameters are given in Table 2. For the reactor tube with a diameter of 3.5 m, a catalyst bed of 11.5 m 3 is necessary for a N 2 O conversion of 90%. The overall reaction rate was limited by internal diffusion as is evident from the low value of the internal effectiveness factor. Concentration profile of the spherical catalyst particles (d p = 3 mm) was calculated according to Eq. (14) [8], valid for the 1 st order rate law. Concentration profile is shown in Fig. 6. Be- cause of slow diffusion in the catalyst pores, the N 2 O catalytic decomposition reaction proceeds only in an external shell while the particle core remains almost unused. For this reason, our future efforts will focus on the preparation of supported catalysts in order to not have wxpensive transition metals in the whole catalyst volume. Furthermore, the larger pores will be useful for the increase of diffusion rate. gen p A As p gen sinh / sinh rr c r cr Â§Â· Â˜ Â˜Â¨ Â¸ Â©Â¹ ) ) (14) The relatively high catalyst weight of 1.5 u 10 4 kg can be decreased by the suitable positioning of the catalytic N 2 O abatement reactor upstream of an expansion turbine because higher pressure accelerates the reaction rate. However, pre- heating will be necessary because of the low gas temperature. 3 Conclusions Intrinsic laboratory data of the N 2 O catalytic decomposition Extrudate, L = d p Catalyst particle diameter (mm) Raschig ring, L = d p 200 P r e s s u r e d r o p ( k P a / m ) Sphere 150 100 50 0 510 P r e s s u r e d r o p ( k P a / m ) Fig. 5 Dependence of the pressure drop on the particle diameter for the different catalyst shapes.

The reac- tion is hindered by internal diffusion in the catalyst pores as is evident from the obtained internal effectiveness factor. The optimization of the size and shape of the catalyst particles with the aim of decreasing the effect of internal mass transport at an acceptable pressure drop is still of interest.

Tel: +420-596-991-532; Fax: +420-59-691-8592 Intrinsic data of N2O catalytic decomposition over a K-promoted Co-Mn-Al mixed oxide prepared by the thermal treatment of a layered double hydroxide was used for the design of a pilot reactor for the abatement of N2O emissions from the off-gases in HNO3 production. A pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional model of an ideal plug flow reactor under an isothermal regime (450°C) was used for reactor design. A catalyst particle diameter of 3 mm is a compromise size because increasing the size of the catalyst particle leads to a decrease in the reaction rate because of an internal diffusion limitation, and particles with a smaller diameter cause a large pressure drop. A catalyst bed of 11.5 m3 was estimated for the target N2O conversion of 90% upon the treatment of 30000 m3/h of exhaust gas (0.1 mol% N2O, 0.005 mol% NO, 0.9 mol% H2O, 5 mol% O2) at 450°C and 130 kPa. Graphical abstract A K-promoted Co-Mn-Al mixed oxide catalyst derived from a layered double hydroxide was used to estimate the size of a N2O decomposition reactor for use in exhaust gas purification in a nitric acid production unit.
