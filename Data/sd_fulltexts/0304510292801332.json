Moro 5, 00185 Rome (Italy) Giovanna Ghiotti and Anna Chiorino Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Chimica Fisica a Chimica dei Materiali, Universita di Torino, Turin (Italy) (Received October 18, 1991; revised April 7, 1992) Abstract The catalytic activity of CrO,/ZrO2 for propene hydrogenation has been investigated at 195 K in a flow apparatus. Samples containing 0.05 to 0.8'36 chromium by weight (0.1 to 1.9 Cr atoms run-2) were prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method. After heating in OZ at 773 K (average oxidation number of Cr, 7e=5.5), samples were reduced to a controlled extent with CO at 393 to 623 K. The activity at 195 K of partially reduced samples (n=4.4) is low, but it increases by nearly two orders of magnitude when n is further decreased by 0.2 units. Thereafter the activity changes only slightly with increasing reduction (down to n=2.5). The concentration of the Crv species observed by ESR after heating the samples with OZ was monitored after each reduction treatment, and it was found to decrease by 179'o in the same reduction region in which the catalytic activity increases sharply. The average turnover frequencies per total chromium (Nc,/molecules s-' atom-') of CrO,/ZrO2 catalysts reduced to the same extent (n=2.5) at 623 K differ by a factor 2.6, in spite of the large variation (factor of 20) of Cr content. The Cr'\"(NO)Z complex formed on the surface of reduced CrO,/ZrO2 by adsorption of NO at room temperature was reacted with CO at room temperature. By IR spectroscopy, it was found that a fraction of the Cr'\"(NO)2 species leads to mixed ligand complexes, Cr\"'(NO)ZCO. Relying on IR, ESR and catalytic results, it is inferred that active sites for the low temperature hydrogenation of propene on reduced CrO,/ZrO2 catalysts are surface mononuclear Cr'\" species with three coordinative vacancies. Introduction The reasons for studying chromia supported on Zr02, and in particular the interest for investigating these catalysts in reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, have been illustrated in previous work [1, 2]. The catalytic activity of reduced CrO,/ZrO2 for HZ-D2 equilibration [1], hydrogenation of propene [ 3 ] and dehydrogenation of propane [ 4 ] has been studied on samples characterized by ESR [5], XRD, XPS, DTA [2] and gas-volumetric redox cycles with CO and 02 [2, 5 ]. Samples reduced to n = 2.5 (n = average *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 306 oxidation number of chromium) have been found to contain Cr' and CrII' in nearly equal amounts [2]. Surface Cr\" and Cr\"' species have been characterized by IR spectroscopy with CO [6] and NO at room temperature (RT) [ 71, and by adsorption of OZ at 195 K and NO at RT [ 7 ]. The selective oxidation of CrB to chromia-like species by reaction with H20 at 773 K does not affect the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of propene [31 or the dehydrogenation of propane [41, and it was therefore suggested that isolated Cr\" species arising from the reduction of mononuclear Crv are the active sites for both reactions. In the present paper, the nature of the Cr\" species active for the hydrogenation of propene at 195 K is further clarified by new catalytic and IR results. In particular, the dependence of the catalytic activity on Cr content has been investigated with the aim of determining the nuclearity of the active Cr site. The dependence of the catalytic activity on the extent of catalyst reduction (e/Cr=electrons per Cr atom) has been studied more precisely by careful reduction with CO at 393 K, a temperature substantially lower than that used in previous investigations (mostly 623 K) [3]. The aim was to define the range of a/Cr when the catalytic activity sharply increases with increasing extent of reduction, in an attempt to evaluate the concentration of active sites. After each reduction treatment, both the catalytic activity and the concentration of Cr species (ESR) were monitored. The Crni(NO)2 surface complex, identified previously by IR on NO adsorption [ 7 ], has now been reacted with CO at RT to find out whether the dinitrosyl species is capable of bonding a third ligand. Experimental Mauls The zirconia support was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride dried at 383 K and calcined in air for 5 h at 673, 773 or 923 K. As illustrated in detail elsewhere [2, 41, Cr-containing samples were prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method contacting the zirconia with chromium trioxide solutions at a given pH (usually 1 by HN03 addition, 8 in one case by KOH addition). A specimen containing both Cr and K was prepared by stirring Zr02 for 72 h with a chromic acid solution at pH=1, filtering, and drying at 383 K. The sample was thereafter calcined at 773 K in air for 5 h, then suspended and stirred for 72 h in a KN03 solution (pH = 9 by KOH addition). The CrOx/Zr02 catalysts are designated as ZCx(T), where x specifies the chromium content (wt.%) and T the calcination temperature (K) of the Zr02 used. The CrOx,Kz0/Zr02 specimen is indicated as ZCKx,y(T), where y is the potassium content (wt.%). All catalysts investigated and some of their features are presented in Table 1. High purity hydrogen (SIO 99.999%) and propene (Matheson C.P.), used in flow experiments, were passed through commercial purifiers (Matheson model 6406). Oxygen (SIO 99.95ss'o) was dried through magnesium perchlorate; 307 TABLE 1 Catalysts and their features Catalyst Cr content SA Surface Cr (wt.%) (m2 g-') (atoms ran -') ZC0.05(773) 0.045 52 0.10 ZC0.3(773) 0.28 51 0.64 ZC0.29(773) pH=8 0.29 48 0.70 ZC0.4(923) 0.39 31 1.46 ZC0.25(923) 0.25 24 1.21 ZCKO.6-1.1(773) 0.60 52 1.34 ZC1.6(673) 1.60 117 1.60 ZC0.8(773) 0.81 52 1.79 ZC0.5(923) 0.52 32 1.88 CO (SIO 99.995) was dried by passing it for 10 min through traps at 77 K before admission to the adsorption chamber. NO (SIO 99.95ss'o) was purified by repeated vacuum distillation at 145 K. Apparatus The catalytic experiments were carried out in a flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure. The equipment has been previously described in detail [3 ]. It is sufficient to recall here that the apparatus consists of two sections. The first section is an all-glass vacuum line, with a circulation loop of 0.15 1, equipped with a pressure transducer (MKS Baratron, sensitivity 1 Pa) and a magnetically driven circulation pump (flow rate 0.81 min') for pretreatment of catalysts. The second section is for flow catalytic runs. The catalyst powder (0.1 to 0.5 g) was placed in a silica reactor which could be connected to the vacuum line or to the flow section by means of a four-way valve. In some experiments, a silica reactor equipped with a side ESR tube to which the powder could be transferred without exposure of samples to the atmosphere was used. The analysis of reactants and products was carried out with a gas chromatograph (C. Erba GC 6000 Vega series 2) with a column (2 m length, 4 mm i.d.) filled with silica gel (60-80 mesh) and employing nitrogen as the carrier gas. The areas of the gas chromatographic peaks were evaluated by an integrator (Spectra-Physics mod. SP4290). ESR measurements were made at RT on a Varian E-9 spectrometer operated at X-band frequencies. The spectrometer was equipped with an online computer for data treatment. Absolute concentration of Cr species contributing to the ESR spectra were obtained from the integrated area by using a Varian strong pitch with linear spin density, 3X1015 spin cm-1, as a standard. Due to the nature of the standard, the accuracy in absolute spin determination was 20%; however, the variations of relative intensities of the Cr`' y-signal could be determined with an accuracy better than 5ss'o. IR spectra were run on an FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 1760-X), with a resolution of 2 cm-1. The powdered samples were pelleted (pressure, 308 20 X 103 kg cm-2) in self-supporting disks of - 230 mg cm-z mm-1 and put in an IR cell which allowed for thermal treatments in vacuo or in a controlled atmosphere. Catalyst pretreatment Before testing the catalytic activity, the samples were heated at 773 K in a flow of dry oxygen for 0.5 h (standard oxidation, s.o., n=5.5 [2]). After cooling to 383 K and evacuation at the same temperature for 0.5 h, the samples were treated with CO. The reduction was carried out to the desired extent in the circulation apparatus at various temperatures in the range 393-623 K, with subsequent evacuation at 723 K for 0.5 h. A trap placed downstream from the reactor was kept at 77 K to condense the released C02. The amount of CO consumed in the reduction was determined from the pressure decrease. At the end of reduction, the amount of COZ was determined by measuring the pressure after expanding the condensate in a known volume. From the above quantities (CO and COZ), the extent of reduction, expressed as a/Cr (=electrons/Cr atoms) could be calculated [2j. Activity measurements Experiments were carried out at 195 K. After activation (s.o. followed by reduction to a controlled extent and evacuation at 723 K for 0.5 h), the sample was treated in a flow of pure Hz at the reaction temperature and subsequently exposed to the reactant stream consisting of 95% HZ and 5% C3H6. The mixture was flowed through the catalyst at a rate of 20 to 170 cm 3 min-' and at a total pressure of about 102 kPa. The reaction was generally followed for 90 min, with a first analysis after 5 min and then after every 15-20 min of reaction. During time on stream some deactivation was observed and therefore activities are expressed as initial rates ro calculated at t = 0 from the equation In r = In ro - at, in which a is the deactivation coefficient and t is the time on stream. The equation satisfactorily fits the experimental data, provided that conversion does not exceed 50%. To obtain reproducible activities, it was necessary to repeat s.o. and reduction between runs because of the deactivation of the catalysts. To compare catalysts of different Cr content, activity data were also calculated as average turnover frequencies per total Cr atoms, Nc,=ro/total Cr atoms (Ncr/molecules s-' atom-'). Results Influence of catalyst reduction on the activity The dependence of catalytic activity on the extent of reduction was studied by reducing the ZC catalysts with CO at various temperatures, ranging from 393 to 623 K, to various extents in random sequence. Before each reduction treatment the sample was submitted to s.o. treatment. After each treatment, either s.o. or reduction, the catalyst was transferred to the side 309 tube of the reactor for ESR measurements, before testing the catalytic activity at 195 K in the flow apparatus. It is recalled that after s.o., a strong axial ESR signal from Crv species (y-signal) was detected in all ZC samples [5]. Previous experiments with 63Cr-enriched samples have shown that the species is a surface mononuclear chromyl complex in a square pyramidal configuration [5]. The results of a typical experiment are illustrated in Fig. 1, which refers to the sample ZC0.8(773). In the figure, hydrogenation rates (propane molecules produced per sec, scale on the right) and the corresponding Crv content (Cr /Cruet, scale on the left) are reported as a function of the extent of reduction calculated from the COZ produced by reduction with CO, (e/Cr)co2. The following main points can be deduced: Upon reduction up to (e/Cr)coz < 1.1 (n > 4.4), the activity for the hydrogenation of propene at 195 K remains rather low. With increasing reduction, a sharp increase in catalytic activity is observed. Specifically, an increase of activity by two orders of magnitude is observed when the extent of reduction increases from 1.1 to 1.3. Looking at the left hand scale, a decrease of the Cr content is observed upon reduction to (e/Cr)co2=1.1, n 5 4 3 0.4 4 0.3 ______________ o U 3 U U 0.2 O 0 0 2 o o~ 0.1 0,0 1 00 _0_0_ O 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 e/Cr Fig. 1. Dependence of the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of propene at 195 K [(O), ro/molecules s-', scale on the right] on the extent of catalyst reduction (e/Cr, measured from the COZ produced during reduction). The plot also shows the fraction of total Cr detected as Cr [(O), Cr`'/Crtt, scale on the left] after the various redox treatments. The Cr /Crest fraction at (e/Cr)co2=0 is determined after heating in OZ at 773 K between consecutive catalytic runs. In the upper abscissa, the average oxidation number of Cr (n) is reported also. 310 when the Cr content is about 34ss'o of the value measured in the s.o. sample. The Cr content is further reduced to 17% when (e/Cr)Coz increases from 1.1 to 1.3. The activity values at (e/Cr)co2 > 1.4 (crossed squares in Fig. 1) are lower limits, since the activity was too high for significant measurement of rates at these extents of reduction, (conversions > 50% at maximum flow rate). The high conversion values arise from the fact that a large sample (0.5 g) had to be used in these experiments because the aim was to investigate accurately the region of low reduction extent. On the other hand, the region of a/Cr from 1.5 to 3 (dotted line in Fig. 1) has been previously investigated using a smaller sample (0.15 g), and it was found that the catalytic activity changes much less (a factor of ca. 4) within this interval [3J. Dependence of activity on Cr content In view of the strong dependence of the catalytic activity of ZC samples on the extent of reduction, the choice of the specific experimental conditions to be adopted for a significant comparison among catalysts with different chromium contents deserved critical attention. The various ZC catalysts were compared after reduction to a similar extent, and specifically to a/Cr values taken well within the region in which the activity changes but little with the reduction extent (e/Cr=1.5 to 3, n = 4.0 to 2.5). In particular, after the s.o. treatment but before testing the catalytic activity, all samples were reduced to (e/Cr)co2 = 3 (n= 2.5) by heating with CO at 623 K, followed by evacuation at 723 K for the same amount of time.

All catalysts have been heated in OZ at 773 K and reduced with CO at 623 K for 0.5 h (n = 2.5, a/Cr = 3.0). (p) Sample ZC0.05(773); (O) sample ZC0.3(773); (O) sample ZC0.29(773)pH=8; and (O) sample ZC0.8(773). 311 hydrogenation at 195 K on some representative samples reduced at a/Cr=3 are reported as a function of time on stream. Two main points can be noted: (i) some deactivation is observed during time on stream and (ii) rates increase with increasing Cr content. As regards point (i), the deactivation process has been previously observed and attributed to the formation of carbonaceous species formed on the surface during time on stream [3]. After deactivation, a complete recovery of the original activity is achieved by s.o. and subsequent reduction with CO. Passing to point (ii), the dependence of the rate on Cr content is conveniently analyzed by comparing average turnover frequencies (Nc,/molecules s-' atoms-', Table 2). The Nc, values of Table 2 differ by a factor 2.6 for ZC samples whose Cr surface concentration differs by a factor of 20. Characterization of Cr' surface species by IR IR experiments were performed on the ZC1.6(673) sample. After heating with Oz at 923 K (n=5.5), the sample was reduced with CO at 623 K (n= 2.5) and thereafter evacuated at 723 K. Analysis of the IR spectra obtained upon NO addition at RT to the reduced ZC samples (Fig. 3) has already been reported in full [ 7 ]. Here it is recalled that mono and dinitrosyls of Cr\" and Cr\" are formed, in addition to N20 and nitrites (and a minor fraction of nitrates). The IR spectra obtained at maximum coverage with NO (P=2.7 kPa) are reported in Fig. 3 (curve 1). Symmetrical and asymmetrical NO stretching modes of Cr\"(NO)2 and Cr\"(NO)2 complexes are superimposed on the two main peaks at = 1860 and = 1720 cm-', respectively. Spectra obtained at lower NO coverage are resolved in two pairs of bands at 1859-1729 and 1855-1705 cm-', attributed to Cr\"'(NO)2 and Cr\"(NO)2 complexes, respectively. Minor amounts of mononitrosyls are revealed by a shoulder at = 1780 cm-' [7]. The situation on the surface becomes substantially simpler after a subsequent evacuation at 423 K for 10 min (Fig. 3, curve 2), as in fact Cr\"(NO)2 is nearly completely destroyed, and a large fraction of Cr\"'(NO)2 complexes (41%, vide infra) is still present, as revealed by the bands at TABLE 2 The average turnover frequency for the hydrogenation of propene (Nc,) at 195 K on reduced Cr0s/Zr0z catalysts Catalyst Cr content 10-' Nc, at 195 K (atoms nm-Z) (molecules atom-' s-') ZC0.05(773) 0.10 1.8 ZCO.3(773) 0.64 3.4 ZC0.29(773) pH=8 0.70 2.9 ZC0.25(923) 1.21 1.3-2.5a ZCKO.6-1.1(773) 1.34 1.3 ZC0.8(773) 1.79 2.1 ZC0.5(923) 1.88 1.3 'Reduced with CO to various extents (e/Cr=2.5 to 3.1). 312 3.0 A 2.7 2.4 2.! 0.9 0.e 0.3 2330 !.2 ,3 2 2000 1800 1500 cm -1 3 2 1400 1200 1000 830 Fig. 3.

The bands due to Cr\"'(NO)2 are seen to be somewhat modified, and in particular the following main changes are observed: (i) a decrease in the intensity of the v,. , mode and a simultaneous shift of this band from 1858 to 1853 cm-1, (ii) a decrease of the intensity of the v, mode at 1728 cm-1, and (iii) the formation of a shoulder at = 1714 cm-1. The band at 1777 cm-1 also decreases. These modifications are further illustrated in the inset in Mg. 4, which shows the difference between curves 1 and 2. New bands at 1553, 1310, 1056 and 860 cm- I appear, all these being typical of bidentate carbonate species [8].

An additional evacuation at RT for 30 min does not further modify the spectrum (Fig. 4, curves 3 and 4). Passing to the carbonyl region (Fig. 5), the addition of CO yields a band at 2192 cm-1 and a weak band at 2167 cm-1 (Fig. 5, curve 2). Upon evacuation at RT, the intensity of the band at 2192 cm-' rapidly decreases and its position is shifted to 2204 cm-1, whereas the band at 2167 cm-1 is unaffected as regards both intensity and position (Fig. 5, curves 3 and 4). 315 Discussion After heating with OZ at 773 K, ZC samples contain Crv' and Crv species in nearly equal amounts (n = 5.5). The surface species identified in these conditions are: (i) polynuclear species of Crv' and/or Crv, (ii) chromates, and (iii) isolated Crv (y-signal). Upon reduction to a controlled extent (n= 5.5 to 2.5) with CO at increasing temperatures (393 to 623 K), isolated Crv was found to be preferentially reduced to Cr\" in the early stages of the reduction and, thereafter, Cr' also was reduced to Cr\", as monitored by the relative intensity of IR bands arising from the carbonyls of Cr'\" and Cr\" and the intensity of the Crv y-signal. Reaction with H20 at 773 K of ZC samples prereduced at n = 2.5 (and therefore containing Cr\" and Cr\"' in nearly equal amounts), selectively oxidizes Cr\" to clustered Crer' species (chromia-like on ESR evidence), without affecting either the pre-existing Cr\" or the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of propene. It was therefore concluded that (i) isolated Cr\" ions arising from the reduction of mononuclear Crv are the active sites for hydrogenation, and (ii) Cr\" either alone or in combination with Cr\"' is inactive when supported on Zr02 [1-3, 5-7]. The nature of the isolated Cr'\" that is active in the reaction can now be better specified in the light of new catalytic results and IR experiments presented in this paper. Despite the large variation in the surface concentration of Cr (nearly 20 times, Table 2), not very different values of NCr were found for samples reduced to a/Cr=3, all Nc, values being within a factor of 2.6 for the whole Cr concentration range (Table 2). In view of the large variation (a factor 100) in Nc, when a/Cr increases from 0 to 1.3, the variation of Nc, comprised within a factor 2.6 can be considered small and the Nc, value below n = 4.2 can be taken as practically constant. Consequently it is inferred that special nuclearity configurations of the active site are unnecessary for activity. In particular, as regards the nuclearity of the species, pairs in Cr\"'-O-Cr\" configurations or Cr\"' in larger ensembles are unlikely to be involved, since the concentration of these species markedly increases with increasing Cr content. The finding that the samples ZC0.29(773)pH=8 and ZCK0.6-1.1(773) display the same activity (NCr, Table 2) as the other ZC catalysts prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method from solutions at pH =1 deserves some comment. The pH of the solution used for adsorption of Cr not only affects the maximum uptake of Cr on Zr02 [2], but most likely also affects the nuclearity of the species adsorbed on the surface. Therefore, the absence of an effect of pH on catalytic activity suggests that the nuclearity of the Cr surface species is mainly controlled by the acid-base properties of the support during the s.o. and/or reduction treatments. Regarding the potassiumcontaining sample, the absence of an effect of potassium addition on the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of propene can be contrasted with the behaviour previously observed with the same catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane [4]. In the case of the dehydrogenation reaction, a markedly negative effect of potassium addition was found, and the effect 316 was attributed to the poisoning by potassium of oxidic ions adjacent to the active Cr\"'. Thus, oxygen near chromium is thought to be involved in the site active for the dehydrogenation reaction but not in the site active for the hydrogenation reaction. This point will be briefly taken up below when discussing the coordinative features of the Cr\"' active site. Regarding the active Cr'\" fraction, it can be evaluated from data illustrated in Fig. 1 that a /Cr = 0.2 is roughly the increment by which the extent of the reduction has to be increased (from a/Cr=1.1 to 1.3) in order to achieve an increase of catalytic activity by a factor of 100. At the low temperature adopted for reduction in the region from a/Cr=0 to 1.5 (393 to 423 K), the 0.2 a/Cr is selectively utilized for the reduction of Cr to Cr'\", as indicated by our previous IR investigation; this demonstrates that no reduction to Cr\" occurs in this temperature region [6, 7]. Therefore, the active fraction of total Cr',, arising from the reduction of Cr is 20% at most. An upper limit to the Cr\"' involved can also be calculated from the decrease of the Cr signal (ESR, y-species). In fact, the decrease of the Cr concentration in the e/Cr region from 0 to 1.1 shows that a large fraction of Cr' ( = 66%) arising from Cr' cannot be involved in the active site, since the catalytic activity stays very low in the same a/Cr region. The intensity of the Cr`' ESR signal is found to further decrease by about 17% in the a/Cr region from 1.1 to 1.3, yielding an equivalent amount of Cr\"'; this latter fraction is formed in the same a/Cr region where the catalytic activity sharply increases. It is this fraction which can be reasonably related to the formation of active sites. The two values of active site concentration determined from a/Cr and ESR measurements, 20 and 17% respectively, are in good agreement. The two values can now be compared with the concentration of active sites as previously determined in a distinct but complementary experiment, in which active sites were titrated by the step-wise addition of OZ at RT to a ZC sample previously reduced to a/Cr=2.5. Treatment with OZ at RT oxidizes all Cr\" present in the reduced sample to Cr', whereas only a fraction (13%) of Cr\"' is oxidized to Cr [3, 7]. From the oxygen titration experiments, the concentration of active sites was 20% from a/Cr (calculated from the decrease of a/Cr required to reduce the activity by a factor of 100) and 139'0 (from the ESR measurement of the Cr' restored when the catalytic activity is reduced by a factor 100) [3]. On the whole, the concentration of active sites determined by either increasing the extent of reduction (with CO at 393 to 423 K) or by decreasing this parameter (with OZ at RT) are in reasonable agreement, and comprised between 13 and 20% of the total Cr\"'. Attention is now focussed on the number of coordinative vacancies on Cr',, as a critical feature of the Cr-containing site. The important role of the coordinative unsaturation of active Cr has been well established by the work of Burwell et at. [ 9 ], Siegel [ 1 O 1, Iwasawa [ 11 ] and our own work [ 3, 71. In this context, our previous IR work has shown that nearly each Cr\" on the surface of Zr02 contains two coordinative vacancies [7]. In fact, when Cr'\"(NO)2 species are formed at their maximum concentration, the NO/Cr ratio determined from the double isotherm method is in the range of 1.7 317 to 2.0. All Cr'\" surface ions should therefore be active if two coordinative vacancies are sufficient for catalytic activity, a deduction contradicted by the above results. A role for three-coordinative unsaturations, as suggested by the work of Iwasawa on Cr' [ 11 ] and by the discussion of the three coordinative vacancies of Siegel's C site [ 10 ], can now be invoked. The hypothesis of a three-coordinative unsaturation for a fraction of Cr\"' supported on Zr02 is supported by IR, as discussed below. The absence of an effect of potassium addition (sample ZCK compared to ZC) suggests that oxide ions of the matrix are not operating in the hydrogenation reaction at low temperature (195 K), otherwise a substantially lower activity would have been observed on ZCK catalysts, as was in fact observed for the dehydrogenation reaction at 773 K [4]. Upon CO addition to ZC samples showing the Cr`(NO)2 surface complex, a new dinitrosyl species is formed with both the sym and asym modes shifted to lower frequency, 1853 and 1714 cm-1, respectively. The intensity ratio of the two modes, I.,yn,/Isy,n is higher compared to that of the preexisting dinitrosyl. From these two facts, it is inferred that a fraction of the Cr`I'(NO)2 species is capable of binding a CO molecule, yielding a mixed CO-NO surface complex, Cr'\"(NO)ZCO. In the three-ligand complex, CO acts as a weak electron donor species, as suggested by the small shift of the sym and asym modes to lower frequencies. The increase of the I,,,,/Isym ratio indicates that the angle between the two oscillators is higher in the mixed complex compared to Cr\"'(NO)Z. The mononitrosyls are also prone to bind reversibly a CO ligand. The stretching mode of this mixed complex is not identified but it is most probably shifted to lower frequency and overlapped to the asym mode of the dinitrosyl complex. The assignments reported above are consistent with those given previously by Zecchina et al. [ 12-14 ] in their investigation of the CrO,z/SiOz system. A difference in the spectroscopic features of mixed Cr\"(NO)zC0 complexes on Si02 [13] compared to Cri'I(NO)2C0 on Zr02 must be mentioned, however. A frequency increase of both sym and asym modes on Si02 for the Cr\"(NO)ZCO complex compared to Cr\"(NO)2 and a decrease of the Ia~,m/Isym ratio were observed. Accordingly, CO was considered to act as an electron acceptor molecule, and the angle between the two NO ligands was thought to be smaller in the Cr\"(NO)ZCO complex compared to Cr`(NO)2, relying on a simplified vectorial model. Returning to the features of the Cr'\"(NO)ZCO complex on Zr02, attention is now focussed on the carbonyl region. Taking into account that CO is reversibly desorbed on evacuation for a few minutes at RT and no new bands showing this behaviour are observed in the carbonyl-region, it can be inferred that the band at 2192 cm-1 arises from all Crr\" carbonyls present on the surface, either mixed or unmixed carbonyls, namely Cr,\"CO, Cr\"'(NO)CO, Cr',(NO)ZCO. The fact that the CO stretching is little affected by the simultaneous presence in the complex of NO ligands might appear somewhat puzzling. It can, however, be recalled that for the analogous complex on Si02 (Crz'(NO)ZCO), a shift of - 3 cm-' was observed for the CO mode and 318 +21 and +13 cm-' for the asym and sym modes of the dinitrosyls, respectively [13]. Assuming proportionality, the shift for CO should be + 1.5 cm-' in our case, and therefore below the instrument resolution (2 cm-'). Lower and upper limits for the fraction of Cr\"' with three coordinative vacancies can be evaluated from IR data, as follows. From curve 1 of Fig. 3, an overall integrated intensity of 310 cm-' is obtained for the nitrosyls of Cr' and Cr\", at the maximum NO coverage. In these conditions, since Cr\" and Cr\"' are present on the surface in nearly equal amounts, 155 cm-' is the integrated intensity roughly corresponding to nitrosyls of Cr\"'. After evacuation of NO at 423 K, Cr'\"(NO)2 are the only nitrosyls left on the surface. Thus, since 63 cm-' is the corresponding integrated intensity (Fig. 3, curve 3), 100 X 63/155 .~ 41% is the percentage of total Cr', present as Cr'\"(NO)2.After exposure to CO, the integrated intensity of nitrosyls decreases by 10.6 cm-', and then 100 X 10.6/63 = 17% is the fraction of Cr'\"(NO)2 which coordinates a third ligand. From the latter value, the lower limit for the fraction of total Cr\"' with three coordinative vacancies is given by 17 X 0.41 = 7%. On the other hand, the behaviour toward the interaction with CO of dinitrosyls remaining on the surface after evacuation at 423 K could be representative of the behaviour of all Cr\"'(NO)2. In the latter hypothesis, the upper limit for the fraction of Cr\"' with three coordinative vacancies is 17% of total Crm. Thus, the upper limit for the fraction of Cr\"'(NO)Z which is prone to adsorb a third ligand is found to be close to the fraction of Cr\"' active sites as evaluated from catalysis experiments (20%) or ESR (13 to 17%). Conclusions Previous work has shown that Cr\" on Zr02 is the active site for the low temperature hydrogenation of propene [1, 3]. In the present paper it has been shown, by both catalytic experiments and ESR measurements of the concentration of Cr , that only a small fraction (10% at most) of total chromium is active, in agreement with the previous poisoning experiment with OZ at RT [3]. On the other hand, IR experiments show that nearly each Cr'\" on the surface is involved in dinitrosyl formation, whereas only a small fraction of these dinitrosyls (8.5% of total Cr at most) can bond a CO molecule leading to a three-ligand complex, Cr\"(NO)2C0. It is concluded that mononuclear Cr\"' species with three coordinative vacancies are the active sites for the hydrogenation reaction on CrOx/Zr02 catalysts.

Moro 5, 00185 Rome Italy * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Giovanna Ghiotti Anna Chiorino Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Chimica Fisica e Chimica dei Materiali, Università di Torino, Turin Italy The catalytic activity of CrO x /ZrO2 for propene hydrogenation has been investigated at 195 K in a flow apparatus. Samples containing 0.05 to 0.8% chromium by weight (0.1 to 1.9 Cr atoms nm−2) were prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method. After heating in O2 at 773 K (average oxidation number of Cr, n̄=5.5), samples were reduced to a controlled extent with CO at 393 to 623 K. The activity at 195 K of partially reduced samples (n̄=4.4) is low, but it increases by nearly two orders of magnitude when n̄ is further decreased by 0.2 units. Thereafter the activity changes only slightly with increasing reduction (down to n̄=2.5). The concentration of the Crv species observed by ESR after heating the samples with O2 was monitored after each reduction treatment, and it was found to decrease by 17% in the same reduction region in which the catalytic activity increases sharply. The average turnover frequencies per total chromium (N Cr/molecules s−1) atom−1 of CrO x /ZrO2 catalysts reduced to the same extent (n̄=2.5) at 623 K differ by a factor 2.6, in spite of the large variation (factor of 20) of Cr content. The CrIII(NO)2 complex formed on the surface of reduced CrO x /ZrO2 by adsorption of NO at room temperature was reacted with CO at room temperature. By IR spectroscopy, it was found that a fraction of the CrIII(NO)2 species leads to mixed ligand complexes, CrIII(NO)2CO. Relying on IR, ESR and catalytic results, it is inferred that active sites for the low temperature hydrogenation of propene on reduced CrO x /ZrO2 catalysts are surface mononuclear CrIII, species with three coordinative vacancies.
