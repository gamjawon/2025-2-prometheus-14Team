Mastikhin Institute of Catalysis, Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk 630 090 (Russia) (Received April 3, 1991; revised July 16, 1991) Abstract By using 6'V NMR spectroscopy the process of partial dissolution of the V206 of vanadia-alumina catalysts by 0.3 N NH40H was studied and samples prepared by impregnation and partial dissolution were compared. The relative participation of three vanadia species identified on both types of samples with low and medium vanadium concentrations (NMR lines at -350, -550 and -750 ppm) and the catalytic activity for the NO-NH3 reaction were found to be controlled mainly by vanadium concentration and less by the method of preparation. Formation of AV04 at high concentrations and the complex behavior of this species during subsequent calcination and catalytic testing indicated a fundamental restructure of the catalyst surface and precluded any viable comparison of samples at the highest concentration levels prepared by both methods. VOZ+ content in oxidized samples was found to be = 4-5 times higher in catalysts prepared by partial dissolution, compared with impregnated samples. Introduction Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are widely used in the selective reduction of nitrogen oxides by ammonia. It is generally accepted that an interaction of the active phase with the support is necessary [ 1 ]. The character of such an interaction is still not fully understood, in spite of much research published on this subject. One of the reasons is that the oxide-supported vanadium catalysts are composed of several forms of vanadium oxides which interact with the support to different degrees. At least four structures have been detected on alumina-supported samples [2, 3]. As was found by Yoshida et al. [4], not all the vanadium oxide in V20o/ A1203 catalyst is soluble in a dilute solution of NH40H and this insoluble part is assumed to be strongly bound to the alumina support. Therefore, it is assumed that by ammonia solution treatment, samples with markedly different proportions of vanadia species in various extents of interaction between active phase and support can be prepared. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 70 In our previous work [5] we compared catalytic activity in the NO-NH3 and NO-NH3-OZ reactions of two series of catalysts, viz. those prepared by impregnation or by removal of the soluble part of vanadium oxide from samples with higher concentrations of vanadium. Contrary to expectation, comparable catalytic activities for both series of samples were found for the same concentrations of vanadium. Moreover, catalysts from both series were identical regarding the accelerating influence of oxygen on the NO-NH3 reaction. Apparently, there is a contradiction between the assumption of a large diversity in the surface vanadia species, their changes by NH40H treatment and the absence of corresponding changes in their catalytic performance. Therefore, we undertook a detailed study of the process of NH40H treatment of VZOb/A1203 catalysts. \"V NMR spectroscopy has been proved recently to be extremely useful for characterization and identification of vanadia(V) forms on oxide supports [6]. A tentative attribution of the lines to various vanadia species of the V206 A1203 system has been presented [3], which was mostly used in this study. Experimental Catalyst preparation Impregnated samples Catalysts were prepared by mixing 5 g of y-A1203 powder (S=210 m2 g-~) with 20 \" of vanadyl oxalate solution containing the required amount of vanadia. Water was evaporated from the mixture by heating on a water bath with constant stirring. Samples were then dried at 105 C for 2 h and calcined in air for 3 h at 500 C. NH40H-treated samples Impregnated samples were treated as described by Yoshida et al. [4] with an ammoniacai solution using 0.3 N NH40H at room temperature. Samples were then filtered, washed in distilled water, dried at 110 C and calcined at 500 C for 3 h. Vanadium content was determined by manganometry. Catalyst characterization IV NMR spectroscopy The spectra were measured on a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (magnetic field 9.39 T) at 105.2 MHz using a frequency range of 250 kHz. 1 ,us radio frequency pulses were used to excite the 1/2-1/2 transition in solid samples. The pulse repetition rate was 0.1 s. Magic angle spinning was performed with spinning rates in the range 1-5 kHz. The \"V chemical shifts were measured relative to external standard VOC13. ESR spectroscopy The ESR spectra were measured at 77 K on a X-band ESR spectrometer (ESR-220 ZWG, Berlin) with 100 kHz magnetic field modulation. The g values 71 were referred to the DPPH standard. All samples were calcined for 2 h at 500 C before measurements. TPR measurement Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were performed in a conventional flow apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector at a heating rate of 20 C min-1 and a flow of 80 ml min-1 of 10ss'o Hz in N2. The weight of sample was chosen so that the amount of vanadium oxide in the reactor in most experiments was - 5 mg. GTA measurements The degrees of catalyst reduction and of oxygen adsorption were measured gravimetrically on a quartz coil balance using nitrogen as a carrier gas. Catalytic tests These were performed in an integral isothermal reactor. The catalyst bed temperature, in the range 200-450 C, was kept within t 1 C. The flow rate of the reaction mixture was 30 1 (STP) h-' per gram of sample. Pure nitrogen (with oxygen content below 5 ppm) was used as a carrier gas, in which the inlet concentrations of NO and NH3 were always 4000 ppm each. The accuracy of the NO and NH3 determinations in the given experimental set-up was 2ss'o for both reactants. Results and discussion NH40H treatment After standard treatment of a vanadia catalyst by 0.3 N NH40H solution, part of the vanadia formerly present was retained on the catalyst surface (see Fig. 1). Two series of catalysts were prepared by both methods, i.e. by simple impregnation or by partial dissolution of high concentrated impregnated samples. The properties of both series of catalysts were then compared at concentration levels of approximately 3, 5 and 8 wt.96 V205. 51V lam spectroscopy Recently a characterization of surface species of supported V205-A1203 catalysts by 5'V NMR was presented by Lapina et al. [3], who showed that all spectra in this system could be regarded as a superimposition of five signals. Three lines, denoted here as A, B and C, belong to surface species having different extents of interaction with the support or aggregation. Other lines were interpreted as well-defined vanadia species, i.e. AIV04 (signal D) and possibly bulk V205. 5'V NAIR spectra of the vanadia catalysts are shown in Fig. 2, in which superimposed lines A, B, C and D, with changing intensities depending on the vanadium concentration, are apparent. Notation of the individual lines was made as previously (see Fig. 4 and [3]). Three main bands can be found 72 r C i V. nrri= O O O O~ O OV 4 C , V. n m ' 12 Fig. 1.

By using the magic angle spinning (MAS) technique, an additional composed signal of form D can be distinguished on spectra of samples with high vanadium concentrations (see Fig. 3). The isotropic shifts for A1V04 are denoted by asterisks. The inefficiency of the MAS technique for lines A, B and C might be due to the large quadruple coupling constant and asymmetry parameter involved in the distribution of these values.

The alternative and more probable explanation would provide a chemical exchange between water molecules in the first or second coordination sphere with physically adsorbed water molecules. The unique behavior of form D in the MAS experiment made possible the identification of various vana.dia forms (compare Fig. 4) and their proportions in the catalysts. Considering the shape of observed lines, the ratio of line A to the sum of (B + C) for both type of samples was evaluated and summarized in Table 1. It is evident that the intensity of line A is identical for both types of sample at low vanadia concentration. The relative decrease in this form with increasing vanadium content is more pronounced for the NH40H-treated samples. If the sample was treated under mild reducing conditions (100 torr CO at 300 C), line A completely disappeared and only forms B and C were detected on such partially reduced samples (see Fig. 5). The changes in relative participation of the vanadia forms during NH40H treatment and subsequent heat treatment are reported in Fig. 3. It is also evident that the highly concentrated samples undergo further changes during 74 TABLE 1 Ratio of integrated intensities of 5'V NMR lines A/(B + C) and catalytic activity of impregnated or NH40H-treated samples Prep.

The D-type signal, characteristic of the highly concentrated samples, is well in evidence here (compare also Fig. 2). On the used catalyst, signal D disappears and the relative intensity of line A increases. The disappearance of line D was confirmed by MAS technique. Finally, aluminum ions Al\" were detected in solution after the vanaaia catalyst had been treated by 0.3 N NH40H. This fact should be considered for completion of the whole picture. ESR spectroscopy The ESR spectra obtained (see Fig. 7) agree well with vanadyl complexes having C4 symmetry as previously established for the V205-AI203 systems [7].

The high value of the /3z*2 parameter indicates the highly ionic character of the V-O bond, typical of supported vanadia samples. The intensity of the VO2+ ESft signal was found to increase proportionally with vanadium content; nevertheless the intensities are - 5 times higher for samples prepared by NH40H treatment (see FIg. 8). The presence of V(IV) on fully `oxidized' V206 A1203 samples is not surprising, as the average oxidation state of vanadia in such catalysts was found previously to be more adequately expressed as V206 _x where the value of x was found to be - 0.1 for samples containing -5 wt.% of vanadium [9]. GTA measures The average degree of reduction, if expressed by the number of oxygen atoms reduced per one vanadium atom, reached values up to 0.55 and 0.40 for impregnated and NH40H-treated samples, respectively (in the concentration range 3-896 V2Os). The chemisorption of oxygen at 25 C, expressed as the number of oxygen atoms adsorbed per vanadium atom reduced during one reduction cycle, was found to be nearly identical for all samples studied and was close to 0.5. Activity No conversions via the NO-NH3 reaction are the same for both impregnated and NH40H-treated samples with a concentration of V206 below 2.5 wt.%, but differ at higher concentration regions (see Fig. 9). 77 30 % conv. 20 le b 300 ,,~ b /~ I C O N E N C Q O U x I I I 1 I I I I I 350 O 200 400 600 800 ~C .C Q ft. 9.

TPR profile of AV04 (c) shown for comparison. All samples were calcined at 600 C for 2 h before measurements. For comparison of their catalytic activity at various concentration levels, catalytic tests for which NO conversions were below 15% were selected, viz. at reaction temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 C corresponding to concentrations of - 3, 5-6 and 8 wt.% of VZOb respectively. Under such circumstances, the amount of NO consumed (expressed here as the number of NO molecules reacted per gram of V205 per second; rNO) can be used as an approximate measure of the catalytic activity. Then the NH40H-treated samples were found to he - 30'0 less active than samples prepared by impregnation (see Table 1). Temperature programmed reduction TPft profiles of the impregnated sample with high vanadia concentration and the same sample after reduction and subsequent reoxidation were compared (Fig. 10). The TPss profile forA1V04 is presented here for comparison. Description of the process of NH40H treatment For the full description of the NH40H treatment of vanaOalumina catalysts, several processes must be included, such as structural changes of the dia species, attack of the alumina surface and AIV04 formation. On decreasing the vanadium content by dissolution in ammonia solution, the quantity and composition of vanadia species change, as described pre- 78 viously. At the same time, especially for highly concentrated samples, the alumina support is attacked by the alkaline solution and a new support surface is then partially created. On the other hand it must be assumed that at least some of the alumina ions from the solution are readsorbed on the surface of the catalyst during the subsequent treatments. For highly concentrated samples, the formation of AIV04 on the surface of the samples was also detected. This species contains vanadium atoms in three nonequivalent positions, characterized on the 5'V NMR spectra by lines at al = - 668 t 2, 82 = - 747 t 2 and 83 = - 780 f 2 ppm. This new species is rather stable during calcination at 500 C but decomposes during a redox cycle or possibly during the catalytic test run. By this process, new vanadia and alumina phases are created at the surface of the catalyst. On NH40H treatment, an enrichment of samples with the surface-stabilized V(IV) species takes place, as reflected in both a decreasing amount of H2_ reducible species and an increase in the ESR signal. For a quantitative evaluation of this phenomenon, the actual reduction mechanism of V(V) and V(IV) species must be known. Comparison of impreed and NH40H-treated samples NH40H treatment markedly changes the ratio of various vanadia forms on the alumina support. Nevertheless, the resulting picture is different if impregnated and NH40H-treated samples are compared at the same concentration levels. For practical purposes the samples were compared in three concentration regions. For samples at low concentrations of less than 3 wt.% Vz06 (equivalent to a surface density of - 1 V atom per nm2 on alumina used in this study), the relative participations of various vanadia structures on both types of samples are indistinguishable. This is in good agreement with the almost identical catalytic activity of both types of catalyst. At medium concentrations, a higher extent of reduction was found for impregnated catalysts, which can be explained both by a higher proportion of the easily reducible form A in such samples and an increase of the content of V(IV) species stabilized at the surface. Full and reliable evaluation of the catalytic activity of the individual vanadia forms is complicated by the fact that they are mainly present as a complex mixture, with only limited possibility to control their proportion. Thus direct determination of catalytic activities of all individual species would be difficult. Nevertheless, assuming a redox mechanism for the NO reduction by ammonia [9, 101, forms B and C which are relatively more stable to reduction must be, at least at lower reaction temperatures, regarded as less active. Then the lower catalytic activity of NH40H-treated samples agrees well with their lower A!(B + C) value. The high amount of AIV04 present in the impregnated starting material before NH40H treatment, and the complex behavior of this species during the subsequent steps, cause a fundamental restructuring of the catalyst surface 79 and precluded any viable comparison of samples at the highest concentration level prepared by both methods. Conclusions It was shown that the simple concept of a strongly bound insoluble vanadium oxide accepted in literature does not adequately describe the partial solubility of supported vanadia catalysts in basic solutions. It follows that the dissolution into dilute NH40H cannot be used for a simple characterization of the extent of vanadia interaction with an alumina support. It was found that the resulting participation of various surface vanadium(V) forms is nearly equal, even if the method of obtaining the concentration level of vanadia is changed. It is suggested that for any given vanadia content on a given support there is one distribution of surface vanadia(V) forms, which is controlled mainly by the vanadia concentration and variations in surface properties. A slightly higher proportion of the vanadia form with the highest oxygen mobility could account for the higher catalytic activity of the impregnated samples.

        "dc:description": "By using 51V NMR spectroscopy the process of partial dissolution of the V2O5 of vanadia-alumina catalysts by 0.3 N NH4OH was studied and samples prepared by impregnation and partial dissolution were compared. The relative participation of three vanadia species identified on both types of samples with low and medium vanadium concentrations (NMR lines at −350, −550 and −750 ppm) and the catalytic activity for the NONH3 reaction were found to be controlled mainly by vanadium concentration and less by the method of preparation. Formation of AlVO4 at high concentrations and the complex behavior of this species during subsequent calcination and catalytic testing indicated a fundamental restructure of the catalyst surface and precluded any viable comparison of samples at the highest concentration levels prepared by both methods. VO2+ content in oxidized samples was found to be ≈4–5 times higher in catalysts prepared by partial dissolution, compared with impregnated samples.",
