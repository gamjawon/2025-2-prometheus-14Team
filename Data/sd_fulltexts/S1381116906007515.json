Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts based on Au and Pt metal supported on carbon, were synthesized by varying the nature of Pt precursor and the reducing agent. It was found that the nature of Pt precursor in combination with reducing agent, significantly affected the process of reduction and particle growth. The catalytic performance of the synthesized Pt/C catalysts in the liquid phase oxidation of glycerol was considerably affected in terms of activity and distribution of products. Reduction by H2 and NaBH4 depending on the nature of the Pt precursor resulted in the most active and selective catalysts. Improvement of activity was found by addition of Au. Graphical abstract Keywords Glyceric acid Glycolic acid Tartronic acid Liquid phase oxidation of glycerol Gold Platinum Reducing agent effect 1 Introduction The use of Pt as heterogeneous catalyst in the liquid phase oxidation is very common in academia and industry. Despite the most common synthesis of supported Pt catalysts is based on the impregnation [1–4], immobilization of Pt colloids [5,6] has been used for preparing very active Pt catalysts. Advantages of using this methodology are the reproducible variation of particle size and the control of particle size distribution. However, the most delicate aspects in the synthesis of the Pt colloids is the reduction method of platinum salts and the stabilization of formed Pt colloids normally performed by the use of synthetic polymers. The reduction of aqueous Pt precursors could be performed with H2 [7–9], or through, photochemical [7,10], pulse-radiolytic [11,12] and thermal means [13,14]. Despite of the large number of applications in liquid phase in which Pt supported on carbon have been used as the catalyst, it has been demonstrated that when dioxygen is used as the oxidant, Pt suffers from irreversible deactivation problems, which can be due either to over-oxidation or poisoning of the metal surface [15]. Nevertheless, a solution to override this problem is the addition of another metal component, such as Pb or Bi [15,16] that has shown to minimise the poisoning, thus enhancing the lifetime of the catalyst. However, problems of leaching and reconstruction of the catalyst as well as a different product distribution can be seen [15]. Recently, our group has demonstrated that the addition of Au to Pd or Pt metals was not only beneficial in terms of activity/selectivity to various catalytic reactions, but it also enhanced the resistance to poisoning (oxygen or by-product poisoning) with respect to monometallic catalysts [17,18]. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of Pt precursor and of the reducing agent in the preparation of monometallic Pt/C catalyst and the role of Au as the secondary metal component on the corresponding bimetallic catalyst systems. The model reaction for this study was chosen to be the liquid phase oxidation of glycerol. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Aqueous stock solutions of PVA (1%, w/w), NaBH4 (0.1M) and N2H4 (0.1M) were prepared. Fresh solution of K2PtCl4 and NaAuCl4 were always used. Aged solutions of K2PtCl4 were prepared upon dissolving K2PtCl4 in mQ water for 60h ([PtCl4 2−]=5×10−4 M). Activated carbon was from Camel (X40S; SA=900–1100m2 g−1; PV=1.5mlg−1; pH 9–10). Gaseous oxygen from SIAD was 99.99% pure. Glycerol (88wt.% solution), glyceric acid and all the intermediates were from Fluka. Deionised water (Milli-Q purified) was used in all the experiments. Before use the carbon was suspended in HCl 6M and left under stirring for 12h, then washed several times with distilled water by decantation until the pH of the solution reached values of 6–6.5. At the end the carbon was filtered off and dried for 5–6h at 150°C in air. The final water content was evaluated to be <3%. 2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Monometallic sol 2.2.1.1 Pt-A An aqueous solution was prepared upon mixing under vigorous magnetic stirring PVA solution (488μl of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution), solid K2PtCl4 (10.3mg, 0.025mmol) and 52.0ml of H2O.

After 3min, NaBH4 solution (2.3ml, 0.1M) was added. A ruby red sol was immediately formed. After 5min, 2.0ml of a 60h “aged” K2PtCl4 3.85×10−2 M solution (0.077mmol) and PVA solution (150.0μl of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) were added. After 3min, NaBH4 solution (1.5ml, 0.1M) was added. The mixture was let to react for 45min forming a red–brown sol, (Au/Pt=3.3×10−4 M, NaBH4/Pt=2, NaBH4/Au=3, PVA/Pt=1). 2.2.2.5 (Au–Pt)-A′2 A pink solution was formed upon dissolving solid K2PtCl4 (10.4mg, 0.025mmol) in 52.0ml of H2O and was let to age for 60h. Then, PVA solution (490μl of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) and NaBH4 solution (500μl, 0.1M) were added under vigorous magnetic stirring. The mixture was let to react for 45min forming a dark solution. Then, PVA solution (490μl), 3.12ml of NaAuCl4·2H2O (8×10−3 M) aqueous solution (0.025mmol) and NaBH4 solution (750μl, 0.1M) were added. It was let to react for 30min forming a dark brown sol, (Au=4.6×10−4 M, Pt=4.7×10−4 M, NaBH4/Pt=2, NaBH4/Au=3, PVA/M=1). 2.2.2.6 (Au–Pt)-A′3 A pink solution was formed upon dissolving solid K2PtCl4 (10.4mg, 0.025mmol) in 52.0ml of H2O and was let to age for 60h. Then, solid NaAuCl4·2H2O (9.9mg, 0.025mmol), and PVA solution (980μl of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) were added. NaBH4 solution (1.25ml, 0.1M) was added and was let to react for 45min under vigorous magnetic stirring forming a dark brown sol, (Au/Pt=4.6×10−4 M, NaBH4/Pt=2, NaBH4/Au=3, PVA/M=1). 2.2.2.7 (Au–Pt)-B Solid K2PtCl4 (31.5mg, 0.076mmol) and NaAuCl4·2H2O (30.2mg, 0.076mmol) were added to 224.0ml of H2O. After 3min, PVA solution (3ml of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) and N2H4·HCl solution (3.1ml, 0.1M) were added. A blue sol was formed and was let to react for 15min, (Au/Pt=3.3×10−4 M, N2H4/Pt=2, N2H4/Au=2, PVA/Pt=1). 2.2.2.8 (Au–Pt)-C PVA solution (1.5ml of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) was added to 238.0ml of NaAuCl4·2H2O (30.4mg, 0.076mmol) aqueous solution, under vigorous magnetic stirring. After 3min, NaBH4 solution (2.3ml, 0.1M) was added. A ruby red sol was immediately formed. After 5min, 3.17ml of K2PtCl4 aqueous solution (2.4×10−2 M, 0.076mmol) and PVA solution (1.5ml of a 1% (w/w) aqueous stock solution) were added. After 3min, H2 (50ml/min) was bubbled through the solution for 2h. A dark grey colloid was left to stand for 18h, (Au=3.2×10−4 M, Pt=3.1×10−4 M, H2/Pt=excess, NaBH4/Au=3, PVA/M=1). 2.2.3 Immobilization Within a few minutes of sol generation, the colloids (acidified at pH 1, by sulphuric acid) were immobilized by adding activated carbon under vigorous stirring, The amount of support was calculated as having a total final metal loading of 1% wt. After 2h the slurry was filtered, the catalyst washed thoroughly with distilled water (neutral mother liquors) and dried at 120°C for 4h. ICP analyses were performed on the filtrate using a Jobin Yvon JY24 to verify the metal loading on carbon. 2.3 Oxidation tests Glycerol oxidation was performed at 50°C using a glass reactor (30ml capacity), equipped with heater, mechanical stirrer, gas supply system and thermometer. The glycerol solution (0.3M and NaOH/glycerol ratio=4, mol/mol) was added into the reactor and the desired amount of catalyst (glycerol/metal ratio=500, mol/mol) was suspended in the solution. The pressure of the oxygen was 3atm. Once the required temperature (50°C) was reached under inert atmosphere, the gas supply was switched to oxygen (3atm) and the monitoring of the reaction started. Samples were removed periodically and analysed by high-performance chromatography (HPLC) using a column (Alltech OA-10308, 300mm×7.8mm) with UV and refractive index (RI) detection in order to analyse the mixture of the samples. H3PO4 0.1% solution was used as the eluent. The identification of the possible products was done by comparison with the original samples. The activities of catalysts were reported based on TOF (calculated based on the total metal loading). 2.4 Characterization techniques 2.4.1 Sol characterization UV-visible spectra of sols were performed on HP8452 and HP8453 Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometers in H2O between 190 and 1200nm, in a quartz cuvette. 2.4.2 Catalyst characterization (a) The metal content was checked by ICP analysis of the filtrate or alternatively directly on catalyst after burning off the carbon, on a Jobin Yvon JY24. The M/C samples were heated with a 5:1 (v/v) mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 till carbon was burnt off. Then a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of concentrated HCl and HNO3 was added for the transformation of M(0) into [M x+Cl4] x−4. The corresponding solution was then concentrated and diluted with Milli-Q water. (b) X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on a Rigaku D III-MAX horizontal-scan powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, equipped with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam. The crystallite sizes of gold were estimated from peak half-widths by using Scherrer's equation with corrections for instrumental line broadening. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Sol characterization “Fresh” K2PtCl4 aqueous solutions were reduced by NaBH4, N2H4 and H2. Different reaction rates were observed following the reaction by UV spectroscopy. With N2H4 reduction was completed in 15min and with H2 in 18h. With NaBH4 we observed a variation in the reaction time, being the reduction completed in few minutes or hours. The absence of the plasmon resonance peak of Pt(0) sol was observed (Fig. 1 ), in agreement with literature reports [19]. By dissolving K2PtCl4 in Milli-Q water for 60h a partial substitution of chlorides by H2O molecules takes place giving rise to PtCl2(H2O)2 complex [20] which is reported to be kinetically more prone to reduction than PtCl4 2− [21]. We called this latter solution as “aged” Pt solutions. The formation of PtCl2(H2O)2 was followed by UV spectroscopy that reveals only the disappearing of the UV peak at 218nm without the appearance of a new characteristic band (Fig. 2 ). The “aged” Pt solution was reduced by NaBH4, N2H4 or H2, in the presence of PVA, in order to obtain the metallic sol. The agglomeration and precipitation of black particles were obtained by H2 reduction probably due to the high rate of reduction process. Different reduction rates were observed by using N2H4 or NaBH4, being the first completed in 15min while the second in 30min. In both cases similar grey sols have been obtained. Bimetallic Au–Pt sols were prepared by using “fresh” and “aged” PtCl4 2− solutions. Two methodologies already published [18] were employed (using PVA as stabilizer and NaBH4 as reducing agent): (a) co-reduction of the solution of the two precursors, (b) reduction of a metal precursor in the presence of the preformed sol of the other metal. The “aged” Au–Pt sols were prepared applying the same conditions as the “fresh” ones. However, “fresh” Pt precursor solutions were used for the Au–Pt sols in which Pt precursor was reduced by H2 or N2H4 since the reduction time was not significantly affected. 3.2 Catalyst characterization 3.2.1 XRPD The crystallite size dimension (XRPD data) of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts is shown in Table 1 . In the case of the monometallic catalysts either “fresh” or “aged”, the effect of the same reducing agent is similar. Thus, using NaBH4 and H2 as reducing agent, small particles are formed, whereas using N2H4, substantial increase of particle size was observed (6.7–8.4nm). In the case of the bimetallic catalysts, the mean crystallite size dimension was similar (about 2–3nm). 3.3 Monometallic catalysts (“fresh” PtCl4 2− solution) Table 1 shows the catalysts obtained by reduction of “fresh” K2PtCl4 aqueous solution. Table 2 summarizes the catalytic data for the Pt/C catalysts. Depending from the reducing agent used (NaBH4, N2H4, H2, labelled A, B and C, respectively) a different catalytic behaviour was observed in terms of activity and distribution of products. The order of activity was the following: Pt-C>Pt-A≅Pt-B. Having in mind the mean crystallite size dimension (XRPD data, Table 1), we can observe that increase of activity was obtained with a parallel decrease of crystallite size. Comparison at similar conversion (e.g. 54–57%) showed that the following order in terms of selectivity to glyceric acid was obtained: Pt/C-B≅Pt/C-C>Pt/C-A. In addition, the distribution of the by-products was affected considerably, depending on the catalyst used. Thus, in the case of using Pt/C-C and Pt/C-B, where similar selectivities to glyceric acid were obtained, the main by-product was glycolic acid, followed by tartronic acid. It is worth wise to note the reaction profiles for these two mentioned catalysts (Fig. 3 ). The selectivity to glycolic acid was almost steady in the whole reaction evolution, whereas for glyceric acid a small decline was observed. At the same time selectivity to tartronic acid followed a progressive increase. In the case of Pt/C-A, although the major product was glyceric acid, the selectivity was 20% less than the values obtained with the previous mentioned catalysts. Moreover, the major by-products were glycolic and hydroxypyruvic acids followed by oxalic and tartronic acids (Fig. 3). Having in mind the reaction network of glycerol oxidation two major routes exist for glycerol oxidation, (Scheme 1 ). One, through the oxidation of the primary OH group leading mainly to glyceric acid and the other through the oxidation of the secondary OH group leading to glycolic acid. From the above results, we can suggest that with Pt/C-B and Pt/C-C catalysts the primary OH group is preferred oxidised than the secondary OH group. In the case of Pt/C-A the opposite trend was observed. Although Pt/C-B and Pt/C-C catalysts showed much higher activity than Pt/C-A, in all the cases a decrease in activity was observed as the reaction time was progressing, indicating deactivation of the Pt/C catalysts. 3.4 Monometallic catalysts (“aged” PtCl4 2−) Table 1 shows the catalysts obtained by reduction of “aged” K2PtCl4 aqueous solution. In this case the same preparation methods were utilized instead that for the Pt precursor the “aged” solution of K2PtCl4 was used. As it was mentioned in the sol characterization section (see Section 3.1), reduction by H2 resulted in the precipitation of the colloid; in consequence, we were unable to support on carbon. Thus, results are reported only for Pt/C-A′ and Pt/C-B′ catalysts (Table 2). Fig. 4 illustrates the reaction profiles of these two samples. In terms of activity Pt-A′ is much more active than Pt-B′, with the latter showing very poor catalytic performance. These results are in agreement with the previous ones, demonstrating that a high catalytic performance could be obtained only with a small crystallite size (below 3nm). 3.5 Comparison of “fresh” and “aged” Pt/C catalysts Significant changes in the catalytic performance of the “fresh” and “aged” catalysts were found in the oxidation of glycerol (Table 2). Comparison on the basis of the same preparation method (A, B, C) the following points could be highlighted. Preparation method A (PVA/NaBH4) gave better catalytic results in terms of activity (almost twice in order of magnitude) using the “aged” precursor instead of the “fresh”. Selectivity to glyceric acid did not change significantly. On the other hand, preparation method B (PVA/N2H4) with the “fresh” precursor gave much higher activity than the “aged” precursor, whereas selectivities to glyceric acid were similar. For the preparation method C no comparison was possible since it was not achievable to support on carbon the “aged” precursor. The most promising catalysts with respect to activity and selectivity to glyceric acid were Pt/C-C and Pt/C-A′ catalysts. However, as it was mentioned before in all the cases deactivation was observed at prolong reaction time (decrease in TOF as reaction was proceeded). The trend of activity should not be correlated only with particle dimension, but some other factors depending on Pt precursor could be involved. 3.6 Bimetallic catalysts We have recently shown [18] that by incorporating Au with Pd or Pt an improvement in terms of activity was found. However, only with Pd improvement in the selectivity to glyceric acid was observed, whereas with Pt dramatically decrease in the selectivity to glyceric acid at the expense of glycolic and tartronic acid was found. In addition, from the catalytic data of the monometallic Pt/C catalysts as discussed in the previous section, we concluded that reduction of the “fresh” Pt precursor by H2 and of the “aged” precursor by NaBH4 resulted in the most active Pt/C catalysts. Thus, based on this concept and using the same preparation methods as mentioned in our previous work [18], we synthesized bimetallic catalysts using in the one case “aged” PtCl4 2− precursor solutions (Au–Pt/C-A′1, Au–Pt/C-A′2, Au–Pt/C-A′3) and in the other case using “fresh” Pt precursor and reduced by H2 and N2H4 (Table 1). For comparison, the Au–Pt/C catalysts obtained by “fresh” PtCl4 2− precursor solutions reduced by NaBH4 are also reported in Tables 1 and 3 (i.e. Au–Pt/C-A1, Au–Pt/C-A2, Au–Pt/C-A3). 3.7 Comparison between “fresh” and “aged” (Au–Pt)/C catalysts based on the same preparation method Table 3 summarizes the catalytic data for the bimetallic catalysts synthesized by using “fresh” (Au–Pt/C-A1, Au–Pt/C-A2, Au–Pt/C-A3) and “aged” Pt precursors (Au–Pt/C-A′1, Au–Pt/C-A′2, Au–Pt/C-A′3). Comparison of these data shows some significant remarks. In both cases (“fresh” versus “aged” Pt precursor) and using the same methodology, high activity and full conversion was reached. Specifically, activity (TOF) was high in both cases and higher in the case of “fresh” (Au–Pt)/C catalysts. On the distribution of products a similar trend was found except in the case of (Au–Pt)/C-A′2. The reaction profiles of the rest of the bimetallic catalysts were found to be similar to (Au–Pt)/C-A2. The reaction profile of (Au–Pt)/C-A2 and (Au–Pt)/C-A′2 are shown as example, (Fig. 5 ). In the case of (Au–Pt)/C-A′2 there was substantially formation of glyceric acid (60% at 90% conversion), while with (Au–Pt)/C-A2 the selectivity to glyceric acid varied between 50% and 40%. Nevertheless, only with this preparation method (referred as A2 and A′2) the highest selectivity to glyceric acid was obtained, comparing between the same Pt precursors (“fresh” or “aged”). In addition, prolonged reaction time (4–6h) after reaching full conversion resulted in the over oxidation of glyceric acid to tartronic acid (35–40% loss after 5h of reaction). Only in the case of (Au–Pt)/C-A′2 glyceric acid over oxidation was substantially much slower (7% loss after 5h of reaction). Note that the preparation method of (Au–Pt)/C-A′2 and (Au–Pt)/C-A2 requires firstly the reduction of “aged”/“fresh” PtCl4 2− and then the addition and reduction of AuCl4 − precursor. In addition, the “aged” Pt precursor gave better selectivity to glyceric acid, thus we can remark not only the importance of the sequence of addition of the metals but furthermore, the role of the Pt “aged” precursor. 3.8 Comparison of bimetallic catalysts using “fresh” Pt precursor Since we found that monometallic Pt catalysts obtained by H2 or N2H4 reduction of “fresh” PtCl4 2− solution improved activity and selectivity to glyceric acid, we therefore synthesized bimetallic catalysts based on these two reducing agents. In the preparation of the bimetallic Au–Pt/C-C only Pt precursor was reduced by H2, whereas Au by NaBH4, because the reaction of H2 by AuCl4 − yielded a black precipitate. In the case of Au–Pt/C-B, both of the metal precursors were reduced using N2H4. Catalytic data of the bimetallic catalysts synthesized as mentioned above, are summarized in Table 4 . Comparison of results (Tables 3 and 4) for the (Au–Pt)/C prepared using “fresh” Pt precursor showed that the most active bimetallic system was the one in which the Pt reduction was performed using H2. In terms of selectivity all the bimetallic catalysts synthesized by the “fresh” Pt precursors showed low selectivity to glyceric acid, which was not maintained at prolonged reaction time after reaching full conversion and it was further transformed to tartronic acid. The only exception to this catalytic behaviour was the bimetallic catalyst Au–Pt/C-B prepared by precursor reduction with N2H4. High selectivity to glyceric acid was observed (62%), selectivity remaining constant through the progress of the reaction. 4 Conclusions This study has shown that depending on the nature of Pt precursor (“fresh”, “aged”) and reducing agent (NaBH4, N2H4, H2) for monometallic Pt/C catalysts, the activity and the distribution of the products on the liquid phase oxidation of glycerol could significantly influenced. In the case of “fresh” Pt/C catalysts, reduction method by H2 was the most effective in terms of activity and selectivity to glyceric acid, whereas for “aged” Pt/C catalysts, it was by NaBH4, suggesting that different nanoparticles can be produced tuning the reductive method. However, in all the cases of monometallic Pt/C catalysts a deactivation progress took place during the reaction. In order to improve the activity and to overpass the deactivation problem, Pt/C catalysts were modified with addition of Au. It was found that activity was significantly enhanced, reaching full conversion in all cases (“fresh” and “aged”). In terms of selectivity, selectivity to glyceric acid was low and it was decreasing as the reaction was proceeding mainly at the expense of glycolic and tartronic acids. However, prior addition and reduction of the “aged” Pt precursor with respect to Au precursor obtained the catalyst that showed the highest selectivity to glyceric acid among the bimetallic catalysts. Finally, the most active bimetallic catalyst was obtained when H2 was the reducing agent for Pt precursor.
