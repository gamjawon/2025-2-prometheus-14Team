The influence of particle size, bimetallic formulation and nature of support on activity and selectivity to the desired product, cinnamyl alcohol, was investigated. Ru particle size had a pronounced effect on both TOF and selectivity. Larger Ru particles showed higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, as well as higher TOR Addition of Sn, Fe, Ge, Sb, Zn and Ag as a second metal improved both activity and selectivity. Ru-Sn/A1209 showed sustained improvement in selectivity, even at higher conversions, probably due to the presence of Ru-Snd' sites and/or due to the electron transfer from Sn to Ru. Zr02 was found to be the most effective support in terms of selectivity. Possible reasons for this behaviour of Zr02 are delineated. Key words: bimetallic catalysts; cinnamaldehyde; hydrogenation; selectivity Introduction Selective hydrogenation of a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is of considerable interest due to its commercial importance. It is well established that over supported Group VIII metals the C=C bond is hydrogenated preferentially to the C=O bond. The research in this field has been recently reviewed by Gallezot et al. [ 1 ] with special emphasis on the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. From the literature review it is evident that the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, the desired product, is better: (i) over Ir than Pd, Pt, Rh or Ru; (ii) on large metal particles; (iii) when graphite is used as a support in place of carbon or silica; (iv) on metals supported over zeolites containing alkali cations; (v) on bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe/C. In several other studies dealing with the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, these results have been discussed in the general frame of the fol- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Catal. 85 (1993) 215-228 lowing two points [ 2-6 ] : (i) the electronic or ligand effect of the support, or the doped metal, wherein there is a transfer of electrons from the support, or the doped metal, to the active metal which results in an increase in the electron density at the active metal site and decreases the probability of hydrogenation of the C=C bond by lowering the interaction between the 7c bonds of C=C and the metal; (ii) formation of new catalytic sites involving promoter cations, which are able to co-ordinate the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group and activate it. However, the generality of the above conclusions has been always questioned due to the lack of an exhaustive study on several a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes over the same family of catalysts, and due to the contradictory results obtained by changing the metal precursor. In particular, the role of residual chloride ions on the selectivity is still not clear. Nitta et al. [ 7 ] have reported an increase in the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol over Co catalyst containing chloride ions, whereas the reverse effect has been observed over Pt and Ru catalysts [ 8,9 ] . Considering the facts outlined above, we planned a programme to study Ru based catalysts for hydrogenation of series of a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes to arrive at general guidelines for designing selective catalysts. To avoid the effect arising from residual chloride ions, the catalysts were prepared by using organometallic precursors. In the first part of this programme, vapour phase hydrogenation of acrolein [ 10 ] , 2-methylpropenal, 2-butenal and 3-methyl-2butenal [ 11 ] were studied on a series of well characterised supported monometallic and bimetallic Ru catalysts. In the present paper we report the results on liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over the same family of catalysts. A comparison is made with the results reported in earlier papers. Special attention was paid to studying the effect of Ru dispersion on alumina, the bimetallic Ru based catalysts and the influence of the nature of the support. Experimental Chemicals Cinnamaldehyde (Aldrich, 99%) and i-propanol (SDS, 99.7%) were used without further purification. Ruthenium acetylacetonate, silver nitrate, iron acetylacetonate, tetrabutyltin, tetrabutylgermanium, tributylantimony and diethylzinc were used as precursors for preparation of the catalysts in order to avoid the effect of residual ions. The supports for the catalysts were y-A1203 (Rhone-Poulenc, 200 m2 g-1), Si02 (Rhene-Poulenc,175 m2 g-1), Ti02 (Degussa, anatase, 120 m2 g-1), graphite (Lonza HSAG, 300 m2 g-1) and Zr02 (200 and 140 m2 g-1). Zr02 was prepared in the laboratory by precipitation of zirconium hydroxide from ZrOC12-8 H20 (Aldrich, 98%) and ammonia in a fixed alkaline medium, followed by drying and calcination at 200 C and 400 C, respectively. B. Coq et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 215-228 217 Catalyst preparation The supported monometallic Ru catalysts were prepared by adsorption of the ruthenium acetylacetonate precursor. The requisite amount of the precursor was dissolved in benzene, then contacted with the support for 15-60 h, followed by filtration. The solids were treated under a stream of nitrogen at 423 or 523 K followed by reduction in a stream of pure or diluted hydrogen. Details of the preparation method are given elsewhere [ 10 ] . All the bimetallic catalysts were prepared starting from the pre-reduced Ru/A1203 (referred as RuM6A1) catalyst. The Ru-Sn, Ge, Sb, and Zn catalyst, supported on alumina were prepared by using the \"controlled surface reaction\" method as described previously [ 12 ] . In brief, the basic principle of this method constitutes reacting the parent Ru/A1203 catalyst (RUM6A1, reduced in situ before use) with the desired amount of the (C4H9) 4Sn, for instance, in n-heptane solution under hydrogen. The reaction was carried out at 353 K. The RuFe/A1203catalyst was prepared by impregnation of the pre-reduced RuM6A1 with Fe (acac) 3 in toluene. The Ru-Ag/A1203 catalyst was prepared by impregnation of RuM6A1 catalyst with an aqueous solution of AgN03. All the bimetallic catalysts were dried at room temperature under vacuum and then reduced at 623 K using diluted hydrogen. In all the cases the atomic ratio of Ru to the second metal was adjusted to 1: 0.25. The samples were stored in sealed bottles under air without any extra precaution. The metal contents were determined from the UV absorbence of the precursor solutions before and after contact. For a few samples this was counterchecked by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The values determined by both these methods were comparable. Characterisation The catalysts were characterised by hydrogen chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy. The hydrogen chemisorption was carried out in a static volumetric apparatus. The chemisorption was performed following the method of Yang and Goodwin [ 13 ] . The hydrogen adsorption isotherms were determined in the range of 6.6-33 kPa at 373 K. After the first adsorption isotherm the cell was outgassed for 5 min at the same temperature and a second adsorption isotherm was obtained in same manner. The difference between the two isotherms, extrapolated to zero pressure, gave the quantity of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen (the stoichiometry of H;n/Ru was assumed to be unity, as proposed by Yang and Goodwin [ 13 ] ) . The dispersion was determined from this value. For some catalysts the results of the chemisorption were checked by TEM using a JEOL 100CX microscope. The main features of the catalysts prepared are given in Table 1.

The pre-reduced catalyst (0.26 g, unless otherwise specified) was reactivated in i-propanol (40 cm') at 383 K and at an hydrogen pressure of 4.5 MPa for 2 h in the autoclave while stirring. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, cinnamaldehyde (5 cm3) in 10 cm3 of isopropanol was injected through the charging port. The autoclave was purged with hydrogen and the temperature was raised to 383 K rapidly without stirring. At this temperature hydrogen (4.5 MPs) was introduced and the stirring was started. This was taken as the initial time. The stirrer speed was 1550 rpm in all cases and was chosen after confirming that there were no mass transfer limitations. Micro samples were withdrawn periodically and analysed on a gas chromatograph (Varian 3300) using a DBWax capillary column (30 m X 0.53 mm i.d.). The calibration was done by using synthetic mixtures of pure components. B. Coq et al. / J Mol.

Under the experimental conditions used, the main reaction products are hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL), hydrocinnamaldehyde diisopropylacetal, fmethylstyrene and 1-phenylpropane. As reported earlier by Galvagno et al. [ 14 ] the diacetal is formed by reaction between HCAL and the solvent, isopropanol, and was always in equilibrium with HCAL. Therefore, for simplification HCAL and the acetal are reported together.

The selectivity to COL increased until 50-70% of CAL was converted, whatever the catalyst used. Two explanations have been proposed for this behaviour: (1) selective poisoning of the sites responsible for C=C hydrogenation, or an electronic modification of the metal sites by the chemisorbed CO molecule formed in the course of the reaction by decarbonylation of CAL [ 14 ] ; (2) HCAL formed at the beginning of the reaction remains adsorbed in large amounts on the metal surface and modifies the properties of TABLE 2 Catalytic properties of alumina-supported ruthenium catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde at 383 K.

In the present case we prefer the second explanation, taking into account that the highest gain in COL selectivity was obtained when initially there is large formation of HCAL. This can be seen from the comparative behaviour of RuM6Al and Ru/G catalysts (Table 4 ). To 222 TABLE 5 B. Coq et al. / J Mol.

The results of this experiment are summarised in Table 5. The addition of HCAL decreased the initial rate of reaction. The initial selectivity to COL was very large; however this high initial selectivity was not sustained as the reaction progressed. The reason for this behaviour is not clear. Effect of Ru particle size in Ru/A1203 catalysts The large influence of the Ru particle size on both the specific activity (TOF) and the selectivity to COL is clear for the series of Ru/A1203 catalysts having different Ru particle size (1.2-20 nm, Table 2 ). The TOF increases by a factor of 10-15 from small to large particles. This behaviour was not reported by Galvagno et al. [ 14 ] who found a constant TOF for the hydrogenation of CAL over Ru/C of different dispersions. However, Galvagno et al. [ 14 ] performed the experiments at atmospheric pressure. They also reported that ruthenium was more active than platinum under these conditions, but the reverse was true under 5 X 105 Pa. The difference in behaviour is probably due to the different kinetic dependency between the rate and the hydrogen pressure for these two metals. It is therefore easy to conceive that the same behaviour could exist between Ru particles of different sizes. Our earlier results on acrolein hydrogenation also showed similar behaviour for the TOF with the same family of catalysts [ 10 ] . The COL selectivity increases from 22% for a Ru particle size of 1 nm to 80% on large crystallites of bulk Ru, in full agreement with the previous report from Galvagno et al. [ 14 ] . This effect is particularly pronounced when the Ru particles are larger than 3 nm (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we did not observe this behaviour for acrolein hydrogenation and the selectivity to allyl alcohol did not change much with Ru particle size [ 10 ] . It is generally considered that B.

(O) Ru/A1203, (G) Ru/Si02, ( ) Ru/graphite, ( ) Ru/Zr02, (e) Ru/Ti02(HTR). Ru/ Ti02 (HTR) was plotted at the hydrogen uptake of Ru/Ti02 (LTR) because the HTR treatment does not modify the mean size of Ru particles. particles larger than 3 nm suffer small change of morphology and are mainly populated with low index planes [ 15 ] . Therefore, it seems unlikely that the enhanced selectivity to COL on the large particles could be ascribed to the appearance of some specific sites, namely low coordination sites. Contrary to this, the behaviour of large particles can be well explained on the basis of the geometric orientation of the cinnamaldehyde on the metal surface as proposed by Gallezot et al. [ 1 ] . On the flat metal surface of large particles, cinnamaldehyde will be tilted far from the surface due to repulsive interaction between the aromatic ring and ruthenium [ 1-5 ] , thus protecting the C=C bond. Against this, the unhindered acrolein molecule can adsorb as a flat species independent of the morphology of the Ru particles and does not show any changes in allyl alcohol selectivity [ 10 ] . 224 B. Coq et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 215-228 Effect of the addition of a second metal to ruthenium As discussed in the previous section, the size of Ru particles has a dramatic influence on COL selectivity. It was therefore essential to compare the bimetallic catalysts having similar particle sizes to avoid the effects arising due to the change in the particle size. The \"controlled surface reaction\" method that we have used to prepare the bimetallics allow us to reach this goal, as reported in our earlier paper [ 12 ] . This was further confirmed by plotting the histograms of particle sizes determined from TEM pictures for Ru/A1203 and Ru/A1203 (Ru6MA1) RuSn/A1203 U C, d a w 0 2 4 6 8 Particle size (nm) TEM micrographs Fig. 3.

Thus the discrepancy between the hydrogen uptake (Table 1) and the TEM observations is due to partial coverage of the Ru surface of the parent catalyst (RuM6Al) by the second metal and is not due to the sintering of the metallic phase. The TOF is increased by a factor of 2-6 upon addition of the second metal. This promotion in activity is in line with the previous reports on the hydrogenation of saturated or a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones over RuSn [16], RuK [17], NiCu [18], NiFe [19], PtNi [20], PtGe,Sn [21], PtFe [ 1,22,23 ] , PtSn [ 6 ] . It is generally proposed that M\" species polarize the C=O bond and promote its attack by hydrogen atoms. This also improves the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol. However, for acrolein hydrogenation such a large increase in selectivity to allyl alcohol was not observed [ 11,21,22 ], except for the Ru-Sn, which showed a clear increase in selectivity to allyl alcohol [ 11,21 ] . As far as the COL selectivity is concerned, over bimetallic catalysts we always obtained high values of initial selectivity as compared to the parent RuM6Al catalyst. However, these high values of initial selectivity are not sustained at higher CAL conversions. Based on this, we suggest that the addition of the second element to Ru produces the same effect on initial selectivity as the catalyst which has HCAL adsorbed on it. That is, the hindering of CAL adsorption as a flat species by the chemisorbed HCAL [2 ] . Indeed, the main effect of the second element appears to stem from dilution of the Ru surface by the inactive second element making the C=C bond activation more difficult. However, some electronic modification of ruthenium by tin for Ru-Sn catalyst cannot be ignored, since a better COL selectivity is obtained even at higher conversions. Effect of the nature of the support The influence of the nature of the support for CAL hydrogenation is reported in Table 4. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in comparing these catalysts having similar Ru particle size. In order to discriminate between the support effect and the effect of particle size, we have plotted in Fig. 2 the COL selectivity as a function of hydrogen uptake (H/Ru) for the catalysts supported on A1203, Si02, Ti02, Zr02 and graphite. Based on these results the catalysts can be categorised in two groups: (1) This group constitutes more conventional catalysts like Ru/A1203, Ru/Si02 and Ru/graphite for which the COL selectivity falls more or less on the same curve as a function of H/Ru. Moreover, as quoted previously, the data for the CAL hydrogenation on Ru/C of different Ru particle size conforms with this general trend [ 14 ] . This shows that, for these catalysts, the selectivity to COL is only dependent on the size of the Ru particles and not on the nature of the support. The high TOF value obtained for the Ru/G sample has to be considered with caution because the graphite contained 1100 ppm of iron which is an activity promoter. 226 B. Coq et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 215-228 (2) In contrast to the catalysts in the above group, the Ru/Ti02 and Ru/ Zr02 catalysts do not show a correlation between the COL selectivity and H/ Ru. These catalysts show much higher selectivity than might be expected from H/Ru values (Table 4 and Fig. 2). Indeed, the high temperature reduced Ru/ Ti02 (HTR) shows features characteristic of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) behaviour, namely, a sharp decrease of hydrogen uptake (from 0.87 to 0.04) without any sintering of the metallic phase (Fig. 4) .

Catal. 85 (1993) 215-228 227 ascribed to the migration of TiOx suboxide species (x < 2) onto the metal particles [ 24 ] . The Ti02 supported Ru catalysts (both LTR and HTR) exhibited very abnormal behaviour. At 383 K the reaction mixture showed turbidity and the material balance was unsatisfactory. The probable formation of undesired side products, not detected by GC analysis, could be responsible for these observations. However, the Ru/Ti02 (HTR) showed high rates of reaction based on moles of cinnamaldehyde reacted per gram of Ru. At lower reaction temperature (333 K) the problem of turbidity and incorrect material balance did not arise. Under these conditions good COL selectivity and high TOF for Ru/ Ti02 (HTR) catalyst were obtained. Such improvement in activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of the C=O bond was previously observed for acetone and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and was attributed to the polarization of the C=O bond by the migrating TiO,x species [8,10,25,26 ]. Interestingly, no extension of this work to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation on metal/Ti02 catalysts has been reported. The Ru/Zr02 catalyst shows interesting behaviour. In terms of selectivity to COL, the catalyst behaves similar to that of Ru/Ti02 and this is true for both cinnamaldehyde and acrolein hydrogenation [ 10 ] . Several explanations can be suggested to explain this behaviour. (1) We proposed previously that a bimetallic RuZr phase could be formed during the reduction of Ru/Zr02, as shown by Szymanski et al. [27] in the case of Pt/Zr02. Electronic, or geometric modifications of ruthenium would result from the appearance of such a phase. This will produce the same effect as in the bimetallic catalysts reported above. (2) The interaction between Ru and Zr02 can induce an epitaxial growth of the metal particles, modifying the morphology of the particle, from a round to a flat shape. The flat shape being characteristic of the low index planes of large particles, selective to COL formation. Such an epitaxial growth was evident for Pt films vapour deposited onto a Zr02 (100) crystal [ 28 ] . (3) The occurrence of specific sites at the periphery of the Ru particles. From TPR studies on Rh/Zr02, Joswiak et al. [29] have suggested that Zr02 will be partially reduced, probably at the boundary with Rh particles. These Ru-ZrOx mixed sites will reproduce, in part, the behaviour of Ru/Ti02. Even though no report is available on SMSI effects in the Ru/Zr02 system, the occurrence of this type of specific interaction cannot be ruled out.

Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was studied over supported Ru based catalysts. The influence of particle size, bimetallic formulation and nature of support on activity and selectivity to the desired product, cinnamyl alcohol, was investigated. Ru particle size had a pronounced effect on both TOF and selectivity. Larger Ru particles showed higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, as well as higher TOF. Addition of Sn, Fe, Ge, Sb, Zn and Ag as a second metal improved both activity and selectivity. RuSn/Al2O3 showed sustained improvement in selectivity, even at higher conversions, probably due to the presence of RuSnδ+ sites and/or due to the electron transfer from Sn to Ru. ZrO2 was found to be the most effective support in terms of selectivity. Possible reasons for this behaviour of ZrO2 are delineated.
