The excellent DFF yield of 95.8% was achieved at 383 K and O2 pressure 2.0 MPa in toluene. It exhibited superior activity and DFF selectivity than other Câ€�supported noble metals (i.e. Pt, Rh, Pd, and Au) with comparable nanoâ€� particle size. The Ru/C catalyst was stable and can be recycled by a simple hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, the product distribution in the HMF oxidation on Ru/C can be tuned by the use of water as solvent and the addition of hydrotalcite, giving either 5â€�formylâ€�2â€�furancarboxylic acid or 2,5â€�furandicarboxylic acid as the dominant product.

Keywords: Biomass 5â€�Hydroxymethylfurfural 2,5â€�Diformylfuran Aerobic oxidation Ruthenium catalyst Â Â Because of increasing attention to the use of biomass [1,2], 5â€�hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been identified as one of the important biomassâ€�based platform molecules for the susâ€� tainable production of chemicals and fuels [3,4]. HMF can be converted to a variety of useful chemicals, and one such examâ€� ple is 2,5â€�diformylfuran (DFF). Similar to HMF, DFF is a versaâ€� tile intermediate and is used in the synthesis of fungicides, pharmaceuticals, and functional polymers with numerous apâ€� plications [5â€“8]. Selective aerobic oxidation of HMF forms DFF, but the presence of the more reactive aldehyde group in HMF makes it difficult to get high yields of DFF from this reaction. To improve this selectivity, a number of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been explored to date [9â€“17]. Moreau et al. [9] reported that HMF was converted to DFF with 93% selectivity and 91% conversion on V2O5/TiO2 with a high weight ratio of catalyst to HMF (i.e. 2:1 by weight), reflecting the low catalytic activity. By using homogeneous VOSO4/Cu(NO3)2 catalysts in acetonitrile, Ma et al. [10] obtained a nearly quantitative yield of DFF at 353 K but suffered from a difficult catalyst recovery. Takagaki et al. [14] achieved a 92% yield of DFF with a hyâ€� drotalcite (HT)â€�supported Ru(OH) x catalyst (Ru(OH) x /HT) in DMF. Antonyraj et al. [17] reported a ~97% DFF yield on RuCl3/Al2O3. However, the Ru(OH)x/HT and RuCl3/Al2O3 cataâ€� lysts were deactivated significantly when recycled [14,17]. A similarly high DFF yield has also been reported recently by Yang et al. [15] with MnO2â€�based catalysts in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, DMSO tends to undergo disproportionation to noxious and toxic Me2SO2 and Me2S under oxidizing condiâ€� tions [18,19]. Herein, we report that activated carâ€� * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 NIE Junfang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 871â€“875 bonâ€�supported Ru (Ru/C) acts as an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for selective aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF in toluene with yields as high as ~96% under mild conâ€� ditions. Ru/C was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of activated carbon with an aqueous solution of RuCl3Â·nH2O, folâ€� lowed by evaporation and drying at 383 K in air overnight, and subsequent reduction in a flow of 20% H2 in N2 at 623 K for 4 h [20]. Similarly, Pt/C, Pd/C, and Rh/C were prepared for comâ€� parison [20]. The metal loadings of these catalysts were 3 wt%. In accordance with our previous report, 1 wt% Au/C was preâ€� pared by a singleâ€�step borohydride reduction [21]. HMF oxidaâ€� tion reactions were carried out in a Teflonâ€�lined stainless steel autoclave (50 ml). Typically, 1 mmol HMF (98%) and 40 mg catalyst were added to 10 ml toluene in the autoclave. The reâ€� actants and products were analyzed by HPLC using a UV deâ€� tector and an Alltech OAâ€�1000 organic acid column [13]. HMF reaction activities were reported as molar HMF conversion rates per mole of dispersed metal per hour and selectivities on a carbon basis. The Ru contents in the catalysts and in the filâ€� trate after the HMF oxidation reaction were measured by inâ€� ductively coupled plasmaâ€�atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPâ€�AES, Profile Spec, Leeman Labs). Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Ru 3p were collected on an AXIS Ultra specâ€� trometer (Kratos, Manchester, UK) using an Al anode (Al KÎ±, hÎ½ = 1486.6 eV) operating at 150 W. Figure 1 shows how the oxidation activities and selectivities to DFF and 5â€�formylâ€�2â€�furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) vary with the HMF conversions over Ru/C at 383 K and 2.0 MPa O2. The DFF selectivity was essentially constant at 95.8% even when the HMF conversion increased from 21.3% to 100%. The selecâ€� tivity toward FFCA was always small and increased slightly from 0.7% to 1.5%. These results show that DFF selectivity is stable on Ru/C in toluene, and thus DFF was obtained in yields as high as 95.8%. Moreover, this excellent DFF yield was obâ€� tained at high activity (15.8 h â€“1 ), which is much greater than ~3.8 h â€“1 observed for Ru(OH) x /HT catalyst (at 393 K under flowing oxygen) [14], showing the superiority of Ru/C for cataâ€� lyzing the HMF oxidation to DFF. For comparison, several other noble metals, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Au, supported on C were also examined in the HMF oxidation. As shown in Table 1, characterization of these catalysts by TEM shows that the metal particles were 1.8â€“2.3 nm in diameter, except for Au/C (3.5 nm Au), and were similar to the size of Ru/C (1.7 nm). Pt/C was active for the HMF oxidation, but with a lower activity (44.0 h â€“1 ) and DFF selectivity (72.6%) than Ru/C (61.2 h â€“1 and 96.2%) at similar HMF conversions (~30%) in the kinetic regime. Au/C was also active (28.2 h â€“1 ), but it gave a DFF selectivity as low as 32.5%. Pd/C and Rh/C exhibitâ€� ed very low activities (4.9 and 5.0 h â€“1 ) and DFF selectivities (53.1% and 40.8%) under the same reaction conditions. The stability and recyclability of Ru/C were examined at 383 K and 2.0 MPa O2 in the kinetic controlled regime (i.e. at ~30% HMF conversion). To recycle, the catalyst was simply washed with water. As shown in Fig. 2, the HMF oxidation acâ€� tivity decreased from 61.2 to 53.7 h â€“1 in the second run, and continuously to 26.0 h â€“1 in the fifth run, while the DFF selectivâ€� ity remained almost unchanged. To understand this decline in activity, the filtrate after each run was measured by ICPâ€�AES and showed no detectable leaching of Ru.

Activity and DFF selectivity for the recycle examination of HMF oxidation on Ru/C at ~30% HMF conversion (383 K, 2.0 MPa O2, 1.0 mmol HMF, 40 mg Ru/C, 10 ml toluene). Ru/C was filtered and simply washed with water for cycles 2â€“5, and for the 6th cycle it was treated under hydrothermal conditions at 383 K for 4 h. NIE Junfang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 871â€“875 stopped once Ru/C was removed from the reaction solution, confirming the heterogeneous nature of the Ru/C catalysis. Moreover, TEM images of the used Ru/C catalyst demonstrated that the mean diameters of the Ru nanoparticles remained esâ€� sentially unaltered (1.7 nm vs 1.8 nm, Table 1, entry 1). XPS analysis revealed no significant change in the oxidation state of the Ru particles after being recycled. Taken together, these results mean the structure of the Ru/C catalyst is stable, and thus the observed activity loss during recycling cannot be due to the change in the structure and oxidation state of the Ru particles or due to being leached out of the catalyst. Because Ru/C is stable, we theorized that the loss in activity may be due to the strong adsorption of the acid byproducts such as FFCA and maleic acid (MA) at the Ru active sites. To verify this, the fresh Ru/C catalyst was stirred in the filtered reaction solution at 298 K before it was examined for a second run, which resulted in similar activity loss (~20%, 46.1 h â€“1 ). More directly, in a separate reaction, the addition of a small amount of FFCA and MA (2 equivalents of the amount produced at 100% HMF conversion) led to a significant decline in the activity (~50%, 30.6 h â€“1 ). This confirms that the activity loss of Ru/C is due to the blockage of the Ru active sites by the acidic byproducts formed during the HMF oxidation. Accordingly, the catalyst which had been used for five successive cycles was treated under hydrothermal conditions at 383 K for 4 h to reâ€� move the adsorbed acids, and the activity was almost comâ€� pletely recovered (Fig. 2, cycle 6). This demonstrates the high recyclability of the Ru/C catalyst, which is superior to the reâ€� ported Ru(OH) x /HT catalyst that loses ~80% of its activity in the second cycle at ~50% DFF yield [14]. Similar activity loss was observed on RuCl3/Al2O3, but the activity was harder to recover even after treatment with NaOH solution [17]. Moreover, HMF can be further oxidized to FFCA and 2,5â€�furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) on Ru/C by performing the reaction in water instead of toluene in otherwise identical reacâ€� tion conditions. As shown in Table 2, FFCA and FDCA were obtained with 51.9% and 8.1% selectivities, respectively, at 100% HMF conversion in water. Such changes in the product distribution are due to the facile hydration of aldehyde group to a geminal diol in water, which tends to be further oxidized to acids [22,23]. Addition of hydrotalcite (Mg:Al = 3:1) further improved the yields of FFCA to 82.8% and FDCA to 75.3% after the HMF oxidation at 383 K for 6 h and at 403 K for 8 h, respecâ€� tively. In conclusion, Ru/C is an effective and recyclable catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF, affording DFF in ~96% yield in toluene. High yields of FFCA and FDCA can also be obâ€� tained from Ru/C in water in the presence of hydrotalcites. Detailed studies of the structural requirements and reaction mechanism of the HMF oxidation on Ru/C are reported elseâ€� where [24]. References [1] Corma A, Iborra S, Velty A.

Tel: +86-10-62754031; Fax: +86-10-62754031 The aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) was performed on an activated carbon-supported ruthenium (Ru/C) catalyst. The excellent DFF yield of 95.8% was achieved at 383 K and O2 pressure 2.0 MPa in toluene. It exhibited superior activity and DFF selectivity than other C-supported noble metals (i.e. Pt, Rh, Pd, and Au) with comparable nanoparticle size. The Ru/C catalyst was stable and can be recycled by a simple hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, the product distribution in the HMF oxidation on Ru/C can be tuned by the use of water as solvent and the addition of hydrotalcite, giving either 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid or 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid as the dominant product. 摘要 在活性炭负载金属钌(Ru/C)催化剂上实现了5-羟甲基糠醛的高效选择氧化. 以甲苯为反应溶剂, 在383 K和2.0 MPa O2的反应条件下, 2,5-呋喃二甲醛(DFF)收率高达95.8%. 与活性炭负载的具有相似粒径的Pt, Rh, Pd, Au等其它贵金属催化剂相比, Ru/C具有更加优良的活性和DFF选择性. 同时Ru/C催化剂结构稳定, 具有良好的重复使用性能. 在相似的反应条件下, 采用水代替甲苯作为溶剂, 同时添加少量水滑石固体碱, 可便捷地将主要产物从DFF调变为5-甲酰基-2-呋喃甲酸或2,5-呋喃二甲酸, 显示出Ru/C催化剂在控制5-羟甲基糠醛选择氧化反应产物方面的优异性能. Graphical Abstract Ru/C is an effective and recyclable catalyst in the aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), affording a high DFF yield of 95.8% in toluene.
