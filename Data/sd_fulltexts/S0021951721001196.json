Graphical abstract The fundamental understanding of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism facilitates the targeted design of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, we successfully synthesized a composite catalyst Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, and systemically unveiled the roles of different active sites during ORR process. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits comparable ORR activity to the state-of-the-art catalysts and is promising to be an ideal candidate to substitute noble metal-based catalysts, which catalyzes ORR via a 2 e− + 2 e− pathway by two kinds of active sites. Type I active sites (pyrrolic-N sites, graphitic-N sites, and Cr-N sites) catalyze oxygen into hydrogen peroxide and then the as-generated hydrogen peroxide is further reduced into water by type II active sites (pyridinic-N sites). Benefiting from the combined effect of the two types of active sites, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C demonstrates a near 4 e− ORR pathway and exhibits remarkable ORR activity. The decoration of Cr2O3 nanoparticles takes effect on decreasing ORR Tafel slope (accelerating electron transfer) at lower overpotential. The insights into the multielectron ORR process on Cr2O3@Cr-N-C offer rational approaches for the design and synthesis of non-noble metal doped carbon materials as efficient and stable ORR catalysts. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Cr2O3@Cr-N-C ORR mechanism Active sites 1 Introduction The enormously and rapidly increasing demand of renewable energy storage and conversion technologies promote to develop next generation catalysts for energy device applications [1,2]. Apart from lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells are considered as one type of the most advanced and eco-friendly energy device for portable and transportation power sources [3]. The key oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells is mainly limited by the high overpotential. Up to date, high-priced platinum group metal (PGM) has been regarded as the most effective catalyst to catalyze ORR [4,5]. Identifying more low-cost and high-performing ORR catalysts than the noble metals is a promising strategy to substitute PGM catalyst in commercial fuel cell applications. Apart from activity and selectivity, the large-scale development of ORR catalysts will be confronted with the great challenge of long durability [6–8]. Since the cobalt phthalocyanine was found to be an efficient catalyst in ORR process [9], a class of catalysts comprising transition metal ions M-N-C (M represents Fe, Co, Mn, and etc.) stabilized by nitrogen functional groups on carbonaceous surfaces were developed successively as active ORR catalysts [10]. In industrial field, chromium (Cr) element is generally added into the Fe-based alloys to enhance the corrosion resistance [11,12]. Cr2O3 has attracted considerable attention due to the broad industrial applications in wear, frictional, and corrosion resistant ceramic coatings, which exhibits high resistance in both strong acidic and basic media [13]. Very recently, Luo et al reported a type of Cr-N4 ORR catalyst via employing ZIF-8 as template, which exhibits high activity and long stability [14]. However, a lucid understanding of the nature of active sites and the factors governing their activity and durability still hinders its further progress in practical applications. In current contribution, we successfully incorporated both Cr-N sites and Cr2O3 into N-doped carbon matrix named Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, which exhibits high ORR activity, near 4 e− selectivity, and excellent durability. We investigated the ORR mechanism on this composite catalyst and tried to resolve the highly questionable roles of N-doping species, Cr-N sites, and the decorated Cr2O3 nanoparticles through extensive characterization methods. In addition, the high durability of this composite catalyst was also elucidated. To identify whether Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalyzes the ORR via a direct, consequential, or bifunctional mechanism as well as the effect of all types of active sites on each ORR pathway, we investigated ORR and hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (PRR) activity on a set of catalysts, including C, N-C, Cr2O3@C, Cr2O3@N-C, and Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. Combined with the poisoning experiment for Cr-N sites by thiocyanate, the detailed roles of all types of active sites during ORR process were illustrated systemically. This work is expected to provide a fundamental insight and principle for rational design of transition metal decorated pyrolyzed carbon catalysts in clean energy applications. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Materials Characterizations According to the synthetic procedure shown in Fig. S1, the catalyst Cr2O3@Cr-N-C was successfully prepared by etching the pyrolyzed mixture of D-glucosamine hydrochloride, CrCl3·6H2O, and nano-SiO2 (with a diameter of ca. 20 nm), and the detailed description is shown in the supplementary material. The crystal structure of the as-synthesized catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1 a and Fig. S2). XRD pattern in Fig. 1a confirms the formation of amorphous carbon and Cr2O3 crystal phase in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalyst. The very weak carbon hump in XRD pattern for Cr2O3@N-C (Fig. S2) may result from the fierce etching effect of aqua regia, which leads to the distortion of carbon matrix. Due to the absence of CrCl3·6H2O in the precursor, XRD patterns (Fig. S2) for catalysts C and N-C only show an amorphous carbon hump at about 2θ = 22°. The disorder degree for carbon matrix in as-synthesized catalysts were further evaluated by Raman spectra in Fig. 2 b, which will be discussed below. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to examine microstructural morphology and the distribution of Cr2O3 nanoparticles for as-synthesized catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c, Cr2O3 nanoparticles (white particles) are homogeneously distributed and attached on the amorphous mesoporous carbon matrix in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. As shown in Fig. S3 and Fig. S4, both Cr2O3@N-C and Cr2O3@C (decorated by smaller Cr2O3 nanoparticles than those in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C) show similar morphology to that for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. In addition, only mesoporous sponge like carbon structure can be observed in C and N-C samples. We applied high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM) and energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) line scanning to further confirm the formation of Cr2O3 nanoparticles in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. As shown in Fig. 1d, the bright nanoparticles can be regarded as Cr2O3 and the dark field corresponds to carbon matrix. This speculation is supported by the EDS line scanning data and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image. As observed from Fig. 1e, enhanced signals of Cr Kα and O Kα were detected in axial direction of the bright zone. As shown in Fig. 1f, parallel crystal planes with d spacings of 2.91 and 2.48 Å are well indexed to Cr2O3 (113) and (110) planes with a crystal plane angle of 28.69°, which further proves that the nanoparticles are Cr2O3. Only distorted carbon lattices can be observed in HRTEM images (Figs. S4a, and b) for C and N-C samples. Cr2O3@C displays a crystal plane of 3.61 Å indexed to Cr2O3 (012) plane (Fig. S4c). Cr2O3@N-C shows crystal planes with d spacings of 2.91 and 2.48 Å, which are indexed to Cr2O3 (113) and (110) planes with a crystal plane angle of 28.69° (Fig. S4d). The elemental chemical states were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2a, N 1s high resolution XPS spectra were deconvoluted into five nitrogen species [15]: pyridinic-N (398.25 eV), Cr-N (399.16 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.40 eV), graphitic-N (401.7 eV), and N-Ox (404.11 eV) for N-C, Cr2O3@N-C, and Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalysts. The detailed fitting parameters were shown in Table S1 and the molar ratio of N-doping species was shown in Fig. 5b (the effect of N-doping species on ORR performance will be discussed below). Observed from Cr 2p high resolution XPS spectra in Fig. 2c, it is noteworthy that two types of bonds CrN (from Cr-N sites) and CrO (from Cr2O3 nanoparticles) were incorporated in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C [16], suggesting that Cr-N sites and Cr2O3 nanoparticles were successfully anchored in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C after pyrolyzing the mixture of D-glucosamine hydrochloride (nitrogenous organic compound) and CrCl3·6H2O. Besides, etching in aqua regia can effectively eliminate CrN bonds in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, since no signal of CrN bonds was detected on the surface of Cr2O3@N-C. In addition, no signal of CrN bonds can be detected in Cr 2p high resolution XPS spectrum for Cr2O3@C, demonstrating that it is not possible to form CrN bonds by pyrolyzing the mixture of glucose (in the absence of nitrogenous functional groups) and CrCl3·6H2O. Apart from the heteroatom doping species in carbon-based catalysts, the structure of carbon matrix also plays an important role in catalytic performance. Raman scattering method was used to investigate the disorder degree of carbon matrix. As shown in Fig. 2b, Raman spectra for as-synthesized catalysts were fitted with four Lorentzian peaks: sp2 C outside graphene; disorder (D); distortion, C5 ring, or heteroatoms; and graphitic carbon (G) [17]. The detailed fitting parameters were shown in Table S2. The ratio of ID/IG is the characteristic value for the disorder degree of carbon materials (high value of ID/IG corresponds to high disorder degree and vice versa, and disorder in carbon can be attributed to the presence of vacancies, defects, and heteroatom doping etc.). As shown in Fig. 2d, both N-doping and Cr2O3 incorporation can increase the carbon disorder degree. The higher disorder degree for N-C than that for Cr2O3@C maybe because N-doping species were incorporated into the carbon crystal structure but Cr2O3 nanoparticles were only attached to the surface of carbon matrix without fiercely damaging carbon crystal structure. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits the highest disorder degree, which may result from the insertion of chromium ions into carbon crystal structure (atomic radius of Cr is far bigger than that of N). Cr2O3@N-C exhibits lower disordered degree than Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, which may be due to the relaxation of disordered carbon lattices caused by the removal of chromium ions from carbon matrix. Nitrogen physisorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the pore structure for as-prepared catalysts, as shown in Figs. S5a, c, e, g, and i. All N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves follow type IV, demonstrating a mesoporous structure and a narrow pore size distribution feature in as-synthesized catalysts [18], which is further confirmed by pore size distribution plots shown in Figs. S5b, d, f, h, and j that pores in all catalysts are mainly distributed among ca. 25 nm. The pores are derived from the etching of nano-SiO2 templates. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area obtained from Figs. S5a, c, e, g, and i is shown in Fig. 2d. Both N-doping (N-C) and Cr2O3 incorporation (Cr2O3@C) increase the BET specific surface area of carbon matrix. Cr2O3@N-C displays more depressed BET specific surface area than Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, which probably results from the collapse of carbon skeleton induced by the strong etching effect from aqua regia. The electrical resistance for as-synthesized catalysts measured by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) can be used to determine the rate of electron transfer. The intercept of X-axis at high frequency (≥100 kHz) in EIS (Fig. S6a) represents equivalent series resistances (ESR, Fig. S6b) for the catalysts [19]. Compared with catalyst C, other catalysts display higher resistance, suggesting that heteroatom incorporation or oxide modification inhibit the electron transfer in carbon matrix. Cr2O3@C and Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibit higher resistance than N-C, suggesting that the incorporation of Cr2O3 is unfavorable to the electron transfer process. The resistance is noticeably lower for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C than that for Cr2O3@N-C, indicating that distorted carbon matrix caused by the fierce etching from aqua regia obviously slows the rate of electron transfer. 2.2 ORR electrocatalytic performance ORR catalytic activity was first examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in N2-/O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4, as shown in Fig. S7. For catalyst C, CV curve measured in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 nearly overlaps with that measured in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4, which indicates that carbon matrix can hardly catalyze the ORR process. After introducing Cr2O3 in carbon catalysts (Cr2O3@C), an obvious oxygen reduction wave can be observed at around 0.1 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the incorporation of Cr2O3 nanoparticles facilitates the ORR process but the improvement is limited. The enhanced effect of Cr2O3 nanoparticles on ORR activity is also confirmed by the more positive oxygen reduction wave for Cr2O3@N-C than that for N-C. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits the most positive oxygen reduction wave among all as-synthesized catalysts, but slightly negative than Pt/C. Furthermore, ORR activity was quantitatively evaluated by rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) method. ORR selectivity is determined by both disk and ring current densities (see equations in the supplementary material). Ring current density (Fig. 3 a) signifies the amount of H2O2 generated during the RRDE measurement, while disk current density represents the rate of ORR process. N-C, Cr2O3@N-C, and Cr2O3@Cr-N-C can efficiently catalyze ORR to reach a diffusion-limited current density, while catalysts C and Cr2O3@C cannot (Fig. 3b), thus indicating that N-doping species in these catalysts play a significant role in enhancing ORR activity. The slight improvement in disk current density for Cr2O3@C than that for catalyst C further confirms that the positive effect of Cr2O3 nanoparticles on enhancing ORR activity is very limited. Hydrogen peroxide yield (H2O2%) and electron transfer number (n) reflecting ORR selectivity will be discussed in Fig. 4 . Compared with Cr2O3@N-C, N-C even exhibits a slightly more positive onset-potential and a larger diffusion-limited current density. It is probably due to the high electrical resistance which is unfavorable to the electron transfer (see Fig. S6), as well as the block effect on O2 mass transfer caused by the attached Cr2O3 nanoparticles in Cr2O3@N-C catalyst. Moreover, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits the most positive onset-potential and the largest diffusion-limited current density, demonstrating that Cr-N species function as active ORR catalytic sites. The superior ORR activity for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C is also confirmed by the exchange current density with the same magnitude as to Pt/C (Fig. S8b) [20]. Among all as-prepared catalysts in the present work, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits comparable ORR performance to the state-of-the-art catalysts (Table S3), rendering it to be an efficient ORR alternative to replace noble metal-based catalysts. The order of half wave potential and kinetic current density at 0.6 V vs. RHE (see Fig. 3b obtained from Fig. 3c and Fig. S8a) for N-C, Cr2O3@N-C, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, and 5 wt.% Pt/C is as follows: N-C < Cr2O3@N-C < Cr2O3@Cr-N-C < 5 wt.% Pt/C. Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is proportional to double layer capacitance reflecting the effectiveness of active sites, which is measured by CV (Figs. S9a, b, c, d, and e, scanned in the non-Faradic potential zone) method [10,21]. It is observed that the ECSA values (Fig. S9f) for catalysts C and N-C are lower than those for Cr2O3@C and Cr2O3@N-C, which further demonstrates that Cr2O3 nanoparticles probably could produce available active sites for ORR process. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits the largest ECSA value, indicating that Cr-N species are the most effective active sites. The order of ORR catalytic performance is in good accordance with the variation trend of ECSA, indicating that ECSA in these catalysts dominantly determines the ORR activity (see Fig. 3b and Fig. S9f). Tafel slopes derived from Fig. S8a was discussed to illustrate ORR kinetics (Fig. 3d). Tafel slope for Cr2O3@C (79.67 mV·dec−1) is much smaller than that for catalyst C (149.46 mV·dec−1). Although the incorporation of Cr2O3 nanoparticles cannot endow Cr2O3@C with remarkable ORR activity, it still promotes the ORR process kinetically on Cr2O3@C surface, even much faster than ORR process on N-C surface (with a Tafel slope of 133.39 mV·dec−1). Tafel slope for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C (65.94 mV·dec−1) is smaller than that for Cr2O3@N-C (77.98 mV·dec−1) and Cr2O3@C (79.67 mV·dec−1). This suggests that Cr2O3 nanoparticles and Cr-N sites kinetically facilitate the ORR process. Due to the decreased effect of Cr2O3 nanoparticles on Tafel slope, Cr2O3@N-C exhibits faster electron transfer rate than N-C in the low overpotential range (see Fig. 3c and d), but the overall ORR performance is lower than that of N-C. The specific role of N-doping species and Cr-N sites during ORR process will be unveiled in Fig. 5 . Apart from ORR activity, selectivity and durability are another two important descriptors to reflect ORR performance·H2O2% (Fig. 4a) and n (Fig. 4b) derived from Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c were applied to evaluate the ORR selectivity for as-synthesized catalysts. Due to their relatively low ORR activity, ORR selectivity for catalysts C and Cr2O3@C are not discussed here·H2O2% and n for different catalysts follow this order below: H2O2% (Cr2O3@N-C) ＞ H2O2% (Cr2O3@Cr-N-C) ＞ H2O2% (N-C), and n(N-C) ＞ n(Cr2O3@Cr-N-C) ＞ n(Cr2O3@N-C). The medium ratio of H2O2% and the medium value of n for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C is caused by the combined effect of different active sites (N-doping species and Cr-N sites). Full understanding of which reaction steps are catalyzed by what active sites will be elaborated with the aid of PRR measurements (see the discussion in Fig. 5). Catalytic durability for as-formed catalysts was examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method. LSV curve for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C after cycling for 5000 laps almost overlaps with the first lap, verifying its excellent ORR durability (Fig. 4c). In direct methanol fuel cell, methanol tolerance is a crucial indicator for the ORR catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4d, Pt/C is more susceptible to methanol injection than Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. The current density for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits a negligible change after injecting methanol, manifesting the superior methanol-resistant performance for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. In order to investigate the predominant ORR pathway on different types of active sites in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, PRR measurements were conducted in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 with 1 mM H2O2 (the concentration of H2O2 is similar to the that of O2 in O2-saturated solution [22]). N-doping species (at.%) derived from N 1s XPS fitting results (Fig. 2a and Table S1) is shown in Fig. 5b. As shown in Fig. 5a, catalyst C shows negligible PRR activity, which illustrates that carbon matrix merely functions as a conductive carrier but is not active to the whole ORR process (not active to both the first 2 e− ORR process and the following PRR process) in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C. This phenomenon is also observed by other researchers [23,24]. Although Cr2O3@C exhibits slightly enhanced PRR activity than catalyst C, the PRR performance for both catalysts is extremely low. Therefore, in this work, carbon matrix and Cr2O3 nanoparticles are regarded to be ORR and PRR inactive. Despite higher N-doping species (at.%) in Cr2O3@N-C than that in N-C catalyst, Cr2O3@N-C displays more depressed PRR activity than N-C, which can be attributed to the high electrical resistance (see Fig. S6) and the block of H2O2 diffusion through catalyst pores caused by the attached Cr2O3 nanoparticles in Cr2O3@N-C. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits the most superior PRR activity, which may results from the higher molar ratio of N-doping species or the effect of Cr-N sites. That is, the Cr-N sites in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalyst may benefit both the ORR (the first 2 e− process, see Fig. 3c) and PRR processes (the following 2 e− process). In order to discriminate the function of N-doping species and Cr-N sites in the first 2 e− path and the following PRR path during ORR process, ORR and PRR performance were further examined in O2-saturated HClO4 with KSCN and N2-saturated HClO4 containing H2O2 and KSCN, respectively. Introducing SCN− groups (KSCN) into electrolytes can shield the catalytic activity of Cr-N sites [14]. As shown in Fig. 5c, the addition of SCN− exerts depressing effect on ORR activity for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, signifying that Cr-N sites play a significant role in improving ORR catalytic activity. In contrast, the addition of SCN− plays a negligible effect on PRR activity for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, indicating that Cr-N sites are inactive in PRR process (Fig. 5d). Due to the higher H2O2% (>5%) around the onset-potential (ca. 0.8 V vs. RHE) for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C than that for N-C, Cr-N sites cannot catalyze ORR in the direct 4 e− pathway [25]. Therefore, Cr-N sites mainly function in the first 2 e− ORR path, while the PRR activity for Cr2O3@Cr-N-C mainly originates from N-doping species. Pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N were reported to be active sites during the first 2 e− ORR process [19,24,26–28], and these two N-doping species are far less active than pyridinic-N in PRR process (Pyridinic-N is regarded as the most PRR active N-doping species in N-doped carbon materials) [24,26]. In brief, carbon matrix merely serves as a conductive carrier but is inactive in both the first 2 e− process and the following PRR process during ORR. The decoration of Cr2O3 nanoparticles takes effect on decreasing ORR Tafel slope (accelerating electron transfer rate) at lower overpotential. Pyrrolic-N sites, graphitic-N sites, and Cr-N sites are inclined to take effect during the first 2 e− process to generate H2O2, and then pyridinic-N sites further electro-reduce the as-generated H2O2 into H2O during ORR. 2.3 Detailed ORR pathway Indirect 4 e− ORR pathways include consequential 2 e− × 2 e− mechanism (single type active sites) and bifunctional 2 e− + 2 e− mechanism (dual sites mechanism) [23,29]. Both of these two indirect pathways involved a desorbed H2O2 intermediate (O2 → H2O2 → H2O) on two active sites. However, the former one occurs on the sites with the same nature, while the latter one catalyzes the multi-electron ORR on two different types of sites. Based on the above analysis, there are two types of active sites function in Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalyst during the ORR process in acidic media. To vividly depict the ORR process on different active sites, the detailed ORR pathway on identified active sites was shown in Fig. 6 . Type I: pyrrolic-N sites, graphitic-N sites, and Cr-N sites are able to catalyze O2 into H2O2. Type II: pyridinic-N sites are capable of reducing the as-generated H2O2 into H2O. During the practical ORR process, O2 molecules are first reduced into H2O2 on the top of type I active sites and the as-generated H2O2 molecules are further captured and reduced into H2O on the top of type II active sites. Therefore, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C proceeds the ORR process via a two-step 2 e− + 2 e− pathway, thus exhibiting superior near 4 e− ORR performance. 3 Conclusion A novel Cr2O3@Cr-N-C catalyst was successfully synthesized via pyrolyzing and etching method. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits superior ORR activity, near 4 e− selectivity, and remarkable durability in acidic media, thus expecting to be a promising ORR catalyst for fuel cells. The introduction of CrCl3·6H2O in precursor increased the molar ratio of N-doping species and formed Cr-N active sites. The incorporation of Cr-N sites effectively lowers the onset-potential and benefits the first 2 e− process for ORR, while the high molar ratio of N-doping species facilitates the following PRR process. The decoration of Cr2O3 nanoparticles mainly functions in decreasing the ORR Tafel slope (accelerating electron transfer) at lower overpotential. Therefore, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C proceeds ORR through a near 4 e− pathway. ORR process catalyzed by Cr2O3@Cr-N-C occurs via a two-step 2 e− + 2 e− pathway. Each step is catalyzed by different types of active sites. Type I active sites (pyrrolic-N sites, graphitic-N sites, and Cr-N sites) first electro-reduce oxygen into hydrogen peroxide and then the as-generated hydrogen peroxide is further electro-reduced into water by type II active sites (pyridinic-N sites). Benefiting from the two types of active sites, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits superior near 4 e− ORR performance.

        "dc:description": "The fundamental understanding of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism facilitates the targeted design of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, we successfully synthesized a composite catalyst Cr2O3@Cr-N-C, and systemically unveiled the roles of different active sites during ORR process. Cr2O3@Cr-N-C exhibits comparable ORR activity to the state-of-the-art catalysts and is promising to be an ideal candidate to substitute noble metal-based catalysts, which catalyzes ORR via a 2 e− + 2 e− pathway by two kinds of active sites. Type I active sites (pyrrolic-N sites, graphitic-N sites, and Cr-N sites) catalyze oxygen into hydrogen peroxide and then the as-generated hydrogen peroxide is further reduced into water by type II active sites (pyridinic-N sites). Benefiting from the combined effect of the two types of active sites, Cr2O3@Cr-N-C demonstrates a near 4 e− ORR pathway and exhibits remarkable ORR activity. The decoration of Cr2O3 nanoparticles takes effect on decreasing ORR Tafel slope (accelerating electron transfer) at lower overpotential. The insights into the multielectron ORR process on Cr2O3@Cr-N-C offer rational approaches for the design and synthesis of non-noble metal doped carbon materials as efficient and stable ORR catalysts.",
