By constructing core–shell ZSM-5@CeO2 support rather than bulk phase for loading copper, the enhanced NH3-SCR performance as well as H2O and SO2 tolerance was achieved. Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst exhibited the superior activity with the lowest T 90 at 215 °C, which is due to the interaction between CeO2 shell and copper ions that promotes the redox properties as evidenced by oxygen isotopic exchange technique. The ZSM-5 core provides more acid sites to improve the ammonia adsorption. Thus, the highest activity of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of redox ability and acidity. The CeO2 shell can react with SO2 preferentially and lead to a high sulfur tolerance. This study provides a strategy for design and the practical applications of NH3-SCR zeolite catalysts. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Core–shell structure Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) Redox ability Mechanisms SO2 tolerance 1 Introduction Selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (NH3-SCR) is considered as one of the most promising technologies for nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emission control, especially in diesel engine exhaust [1]. Copper-zeolites have been the most attractive catalysts for the NO x removal, and there are also some commercial zeolites used for NO x removal, such as Cu-SSZ-13, Cu-SAPO-34 and so on [2,3], which show excellent catalytic performance and satisfactory hydrothermal stability. However, one major drawback of such catalysts that limits their applications in NH3-SCR process is their high price. Cu-ZSM-5 was first proposed to exhibit activity for SCR of NO x by Iwamoto et al. [4]. Compared with CHA-type zeolites (SSZ-13, SAPO-34), ZSM-5 zeolite is relatively cheaper and easier to be synthesized. Thus, Cu-ZSM-5 has drawn more attention in the NO x reduction application. The relatively poor hydrothermal stability of Cu-ZSM-5 limits its broader applications in NH3-SCR of stationary source [5]. Nevertheless, for the mobile source being emphasized by this work, diesel engine exhaust contains certain amount of SO2, which commonly caused catalyst poisoning and deactivation during the reaction process [6]. Therefore, how to improve the hydrothermal stability as well as SO2 tolerance of Cu-ZSM-5 is still challenging [7]. An effective strategy is to develop hybrid catalysts consisting of metal oxides and Cu-exchanged zeolites to overcome this problem. Yu et al. [2] proposed that ZnTi10Ox in ZnTi10Ox-Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst preferred to react with SO2 and protected the Cu2+ active sites, thereby exhibiting superior SO2 tolerance. Ma et al. [8] suggested that Cu-Ce co-doped SAPO-5/34 catalyst displayed outstanding sulfur resistance. In addition, ceria as additive has received much attention to improve the sulfur tolerance of metal oxides [9]. Jin et al. [10] pointed out the Ce modified Mn/TiO2 catalysts promoted SO2 tolerance during SCR process via the inhibiting sulfation of main active sites. Yan et al. [11] also proposed the ceria doping Cu4Al1O x -layered double oxide could withstand poisoning of SO2, HCl and H2O during NH3-SCR. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of CeO2 on the poisoning tolerance of Cu-ZSM-5 has been rarely studied. The assembly of two components in a hybrid catalyst also has great influence on the performance. Compared with the hybrid catalyst mixed mechanically, the core–shell structured catalysts have drawn more attention owing to their high hydrothermal stability and excellent resistance under corrosive conditions [12]. Many core–shell structured catalysts have been proposed to exhibit superior performance in biomedical applications and engineered catalysts [13], as well as in catalytic applications [14]. Liu et al. [15] designed a MoFe/Beta@CeO2 catalyst with strong acidity and good hydrothermal stability, which showed high NH3-SCR activity and SO2 tolerance. Chen et al. [6] prepared a hierarchical Fe-ZSM-5@CeO2 catalyst that possessed uniform active sites and excellent NH3-SCR performance. Recently, Han et al. [16] prepared a mesoporous-TiO2@Fe2O3@Al2O3 monolith catalyst and it exhibited high NH3-SCR activity and superior SO2 tolerance, which promoted the practical applications. Nevertheless, there are few reports on the zeolitic core–shell catalysts for NH3-SCR reaction. In this study, core–shell structured ZSM-5@CeO2 and CeO2@ZSM-5 were assembled and used for loading copper to obtain deNO x catalysts. The effect of CeO2 or ZSM-5 as shell on the catalytic activity and poisoning tolerance was investigated. From detailed characterizations and in situ DRIFTS analysis, the main poisoning sulfate species were proposed. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 CeO2 synthesis CeO2 was prepared via a simple precipitation method at room temperature, which has been reported earlier [17]. 2.1.2 ZSM-5 synthesis The conventional ZSM-5 zeolite was prepared through a hydrothermal method with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt% in water, Macklin) as template, which was described in Supporting information (SI). 2.1.3 Core-shell catalyst synthesis CeO2@ZSM-5 was synthesized by dispersing CeO2 in the precursor of ZSM-5. 0.2 g CeO2 first dispersed in 20 ml ethanol/H2O mixture (1:1 vol/vol) under stirring for 5 min and then ultrasonic for 10 min to get a well dispersed solution. The synthesizing solution of ZSM-5 was subsequently added under stirring at 50 °C for 5 h to remove ethanol and water was added to maintain a constant volume. After crystallization at 170 °C for 3 days, the powder was recovered by filter and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the powder was calcined in air at 550 °C for 8 h to remove the organic template. ZSM-5@CeO2 obtained by dispersing ZSM-5 in the precursor of CeO2. 0.5 g ZSM-5 highly dispersed in 20 ml ethanol/H2O mixture (1:1 vol/vol) under stirring for 30 min and then ultrasonic for 10 min. After that, 1 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added and stirred until completely dissolved. Subsequently, 0.3 g Ce(NO3)3.6 H2O and 0.3 g hexamethylenetetramine were added under stirring for 2 h at 60 °C and statically aged for 3 h. Finally, the product was obtained by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 100 °C for 12 h, followed by calcination at 550 °C in static air for 8 h. The pristine supports were ion-exchanged with NH4NO3 solution and successive impregnated with Cu(COOCH3)2 solution to get Cu-loaded catalysts, more details were described in SI. 2.1.4 Cu&Ce/ZSM-5 synthesis Cu&Ce/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized by impregnating ZSM-5 zeolite with 4.7 wt% copper acetate [Cu(COOCH3)2, 99%, Macklin] and 29.5 wt% Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. 2.2 Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) to confirm zeolite crystallization. The patterns were obtained in the 2θ range of 5–50 ° with a scanning speed of 2 ° min−1. The structural topologies of the zeolites were identified according to the International Zeolite Association (IZA) reference and the metal oxide was identified by JCPDS card. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with a JEM-2100PLUS microscope was used. The content of elements on surface was collected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis with a 3271E spectrometer (Rigaku Industrial Corporation, JPN) was used to determine the amount of metallic elements in the different catalysts. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined by a MicroActive ASAP 2460 instrument at liquid N2 temperature according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore size distributions were measured by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method (N2 at 77 K assuming slit pores without regularization). In addition, these zeolites were vacuum degassed at 200 °C before measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using monochromatic Al Kα radiation under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250 system. The binding energies were calibrated with respect to the C 1 s energy of the incidental C–C bonds at 285.0 eV. 18O-isotopic exchange (OIE) was used to evaluate the oxygen mobility and diffusion rate in catalysts. A recirculation reactor containing the catalyst was connected to a quadrupolar mass spectrometer (regulated at a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar) for analysis of the isotopes present in the gas phase fraction (18O2, 16O18O, 16O2). 100 mg of catalyst was loaded in a fixed-bed reactor, and pretreated under air at 550 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the sample was cooled to 200 °C, evacuated under vacuum prior to 60 mbar of 18O2 is added in the reactor. When steady state was reached, the temperature of the reactor increased from 200 °C to 570 °C (ramp rate of 2 °C min−1). The evolution of 18O fraction, issued from quantification of the different isotopes in the gas phase, was registered with reaction temperature. Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was carried out inside a fixed-bed reactor with a sample (~200 mg) pretreated in situ by Ar (20 ml min−1) at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature under the same atmosphere, the sample was exposed to 5% H2/Ar (20 ml min−1) and heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from 100 ° to 750 °C. H2 consumption was monitored online by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was performed on a GC4000A gas chromatograph, and the signal was monitored by a TCD. Typically, the samples were pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h under He flow. After the samples cooled to room temperature, they were saturated with 4% NH3/He at 100 °C for 1 h. The samples were then purged with He for 2 h and finally heated to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. In situ DRIFTS was carried out on a Bruker TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a gas cell and liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The samples were pretreated at 300 °C for 4 h to eliminate physically adsorbed gases and water. Before recording the spectra, the sample was exposed to He (20 ml min−1) for 30 min to collect the background signal and then exposed to the feed gas at the desired temperature. Each spectrum was collected with a resolution of 2 cm−1 and an accumulation of 32 scans. 2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation The activity measurements were carried out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (6 mm i.d.) loaded with 100 mg of catalyst under an atmosphere of 1000 ppm NH3, 1000 ppm NO and 8 vol% O2, 5% H2O balanced by He at a total flow rate of ~130 ml min−1. Before the reaction, samples were outgassed under pure He at the calcination temperature for 1 h. The reaction temperature increased from 100° to 550°C with a thermocouple inserted at the middle of the fixed bed. The exhaust gases were detected using an infrared gas analyzer (Nicolet Nexus 670) equipped with TQ analysis software and a 2.4 m long-path gas cell. N2 is analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC) (Hewlett Packard 5890) equipped with a TCD and columns of molecular 13 X (45–60 mesh, 2.4 m) combined with Silicone OV-101 (100–120 mesh, 0.6 m) operating at an oven temperature of 30 °C. Nitrogen balance was achieved with an error within 3%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization The successful synthesis of Cu/CeO2, Cu/ZSM-5 and core–shell structure of Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) and Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalysts were checked through XRD detection ( Fig. 1). The main peaks at 7–9° and 23–25° perfectly match the MFI configuration and the peaks at 28.6, 33.0 and 47.5° can be ascribed to the characteristic reflections of cerium oxide with a fluorite-like structure. The weak diffraction peaks of cerium oxide occurred on the core–shell structure catalysts, especially for the ZSM-5@CeO2 sample, which is attributed to the small particle size or thin film of CeO2. It is worth noting that a little shift toward low degree below 10° in two core–shell samples, which can be ascribed to the existence of CeO2 that affect the lattice stress of ZSM-5. However, none peaks of CuO x can be observed among the samples, indicating the copper ions were highly dispersed or the particle size of CuO x was very small. The XRD results of pristine supports are shown in Fig. S1 and no substantial changes are observed after copper loading, confirming the stability of the zeolite structures during the impregnation procedure. HRTEM was used to investigate the morphologies of all samples as illustrated in Fig. 2. The Cu/CeO2 exhibits the nanosheet morphology and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveals the different exposed crystal planes ((111), (220), etc.) of CeO2, which indicates these nanosheets are formed by the accumulation of small crystals [18]. Some CuO x clusters can be observed on Cu/ZSM-5 (Fig. 2d) and almost no area diffraction spots are detected. For the core–shell structured catalysts, it can be observed that the outer surface is successfully covered by the stacked grain “layer”. The clear boundary formed by the lattice fringes as well as the SAED pattern further proves the formation of core–shell structure (Fig. 2f, h). The elemental component measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) performed with TEM is shown in Fig. S2. The lower content of Ce was observed in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) (8.85 wt%) than in Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) (38.35 wt%), which also proves the amount of CeO2 shell is low. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and NLDFT pore size distributions are shown in Fig. S3. All samples show type-I isotherm, characterized as microporous materials. Interestingly, at high relative pressure stage, a sharp increase of adsorption occurs in core–shell structure catalysts, which can be ascribed to the formation of mesoporous from aggregates of small crystals in the shell grains. The specific surface area (SSA) of the catalysts ( Table 1) follows the trend of Cu/(CeO2 @ZSM-5) (374 m2 g−1) > Cu/ZSM-5 (370 m2 g−1) > Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) (319 m2 g−1) > Cu/CeO2 (79 m2 g−1). It reveals that the CeO2 shell can reduce the SSA. No significant difference in micropore volume is observed in the Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) samples, indicating that the coated CeO2 shell does not destroy the micropores of the ZSM-5 core. In pore size distribution, the typical pore size of MFI configuration at 0.5–0.6 nm can be clearly observed. 3.2 Characterization of acidity and copper species The NH3-TPD measurements were carried out to determine the effect of shell structure on the amount and strength of acid sites of the catalysts ( Fig. 3a). The Cu/CeO2 sample contains little acid sites. It can be found that the content of acid sites in Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) is close to that of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2), while Cu/ZSM-5 shows a higher content of acid sites, which is due to the presence of CeO2 that can reduce the relative content of ZSM-5. Three NH3 desorption peaks belonging to the weak (120–230 °C), moderate (230–400 °C), and strong (400–750 °C) acid sites can be observed in the three samples [19]. More moderate and strong acid sites are observed in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) than Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample, which is beneficial to stabilize the adsorbed NH3 [6,20]. Besides, the intermediate species of NH3 oxidation formed at moderate and strong acid sites are not easy to be desorbed, and likely inhibit the formation of N2O [3]. It has been reported that moderate acids are formed by the exchange of Cu cations on the Brønsted acid sites in zeolite [21]. The significant change of moderate acid sites in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) indicates that the presence of CeO2 on surface affects the exchange of copper ions. The interaction between Cu and Ce influences the local environment of copper ions and further increases the moderate acid sites. NH3 molecules are probably bonded to Cu ions that cooperated with cerium by donor–acceptor bond, which is formed by attaching the free electron pair of ammonia into unoccupied d-orbitals of Cu. The redox properties of the catalysts play a key role in NH3-SCR reaction. H2-TPR characterization is important for evaluating the redox properties of core–shell catalysts, and reveals the existence of copper species. As evidenced in Fig. 3b, four reduction peaks are clearly observed in Cu/CeO2, corresponding to the reduction of copper species (150–250 °C, 485 °C) and bulk oxygen in CeO2 (> 750 °C), respectively [22]. According to the description in the literatures, the reduction curve of Cu/ZSM-5 could be mainly deconvoluted into four ones, which are assigned to the reduction of isolated Cu2+ to Cu+ ions (215 °C), dispersed CuO to Cu0 (266 °C) [23,24], CuO x clusters to Cu0 (319 °C), and Cu+ ions to metallic Cu (435 °C), respectively [25]. As for core–shell catalysts, it can be observed that the location of reduction peak is slightly different from the peak of Cu/ZSM-5, which shows a shift to the low temperature. Especially for the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst, the reduction peaks of the copper species and the CeO2 shell obviously shift to low temperature due to an imitate interaction between the CeO2 shell and the ZSM-5 core compared with Cu/CeO2. Accordingly, the peak at 678 °C could be assigned to the reduction of bulk CeO2 [6]. It has been reported that the copper species in proximity to the CeO2 are reduced more easily by hydrogen [26]. Kang et al. [27] reported that the supported copper ions can form Cu–O–Ce with CeO2, which further affect the redox properties. Moreover, Feng et al. [28] pointed out that part of copper ions can incorporate into the vacant sites of cerium oxides to form coordinated surface structure with the capping oxygen and this copper species can probably migrate outside the cerium oxide network to become highly dispersed copper ions that are easily to be reduced. It is worth noting that the intensity of reduction peak at 215 °C (Cu2+→Cu+) in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) is higher than that in Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5), whereas the reduction peak of CuO x (265 °C) in Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) is significant higher than that in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2). This indicates that more isolated Cu2+ ions exist in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample and more CuO x formed in Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample. Because of the interaction between CeO2 and Cu, the CeO2 shell can not only promote the abundance of Cu2+ ions on the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst surface, but also inhibit the formation of CuO x . As a result, less copper would go inside the ZSM-5 core for ion exchange. XPS characterization was carried out to analyze the element content and valence states of Cu species, O species and Ce species on the catalysts surface (Table1, Fig. 4). The Ce content in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample detected by XPS (61.4%) is significantly higher than that by ICP-OES (12.5%), which confirms the formation of CeO2 shell. The Cu contents in Cu/ZSM-5, Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) and Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) detected by ICP-OES are almost the same. However, the corresponding contents detected by XPS vary and the Cu content in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) is the highest. This result suggests that the presence of CeO2 has a remarkable influence on the distribution of copper. Compared with the Cu contents in the three samples detected by XPS, the corresponding Cu contents detected by ICP-OES are higher, which suggests that most Cu is distributed in the bulk catalysts. The relative content of surface adsorbed oxygen in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample is the largest, indicating that the CeO2 shell can provide more oxygen vacancies or interact with copper ions to generate adsorbed oxygen species. It has been reported that the surface adsorbed oxygen possesses higher mobility than lattice oxygen, which is beneficial to improve the redox properties and further promote the activity [28]. The Cu 2p binding energy peaks at 952.5 ± 0.2 and 932.8 ± 0.2 eV are related to the Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Cu+, respectively [29]. Similarly, the binding energy peaks at 953.7 ± 0.2 and 934.6 ± 0.2 eV are assigned respectively to the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 of Cu2+ species (i.e., from both isolated Cu2+ and CuO x ). In addition, the Cu2+ satellite peaks can be found at approximately 10 eV higher than its Cu2+ 2p3/2 peak [30]. It can be found that the peak intensity of Cu2+ species is similar among the samples, while the intensity of Cu+ species in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) is higher than that in Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5). This can be ascribed to the higher concentrations of isolated Cu2+ ions in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample undergo auto-reduction to Cu+ during high vacuum pretreatments process of XPS or the interaction between CeO2 shell and copper ions that can stabilize the presence of more Cu+ ions. From the O 1 s XPS result (Fig. 4b), three kinds of O species can be observed among the samples. The binding energy peaks at 529.5, 531.9 and 532.8 eV are assigned to lattice oxygen, surface adsorbed oxygen and –OH or surface adsorbed water, respectively [31]. CeO2 shows the largest lattice oxygen and Cu/ZSM-5 possesses more –OH or surface adsorbed water. Importantly, no lattice oxygen can be observed on Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5), indicating the CeO2 core is completely wrapped by ZSM-5 and cannot be penetrated by X-rays. As for Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample, all three kinds of oxygen species can be found, the small peak of lattice oxygen indicates that the CeO2 shell formed as a thin layer. In addition, Fig. 4c shows the Ce 3d XPS spectrum of Cu/CeO2, Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) and Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2), which is split into eight peaks related to Ce4+ (t, t’’, t’’’, u, u’’, u’’’) and Ce3+ (t′, u′) species [32]. It can be observed that the peak intensity of Ce species on Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample is very low and almost no concentration of cerium can be found on the surface, which also confirms the dense wrapping of the ZSM-5 shell. The Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample shows the similar peaks to Cu/CeO2, indicating that Ce4+ and Ce3+ species coexist in the CeO2 shell. OIE experiment is used to investigate the mobility of oxygen species. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the total numbers of oxygen atoms including accessible surface oxygen, grain boundaries oxygen and bulk oxygen, exchanged in the temperature range of 200–570 °C follows the order: Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) > Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) > Cu/ZSM-5. At low temperatures, 18O2 exchanges with the surface 16O atoms, and the lowest exchanged temperature is obtained over Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2). With the temperature increased, lattice oxygen starts to exchange in the different catalysts. In addition, the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample also exhibits the highest oxygen exchange rate (Fig. 3d) due to anion vacancies formed on the CeO2 shell, which can promote the oxygen mobility. Thus, the synergistic behavior between CeO2 shell and Cu can not only promote the rapid switching of Cu2+ ↔ Cu+, but also increase the oxygen mobility, which further promotes the redox properties of the catalyst and accelerates the oxidation of NO to NO2 considering as a crucial step according to the “fast SCR” mechanism [33,34]. As we all know, Cu2+ ion is the main active site of NH3-SCR. In the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst, the synergy of the CeO2 shell and Cu can form Ce4+-Cu+ and Ce3+-Cu2+ structures [29,35], so as to ensure the existence of active ionic copper species and improve the dispersion of copper species on the sample surface. The best copper dispersion leads to the highest surface Cu content of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) in XPS results. And copper ions have unique location sites in the ZSM-5 channel, when the sites are saturated, CuO x will be formed on the outer surface. The CeO2 shell can inhibit the agglomeration of copper oxide. Actually, the better copper dispersion indeed associated with the outstanding redox properties [36]. High Cu dispersion promotes a rapid Cu2+ ↔ Cu+ switch, therby showing superior redox behavior during the NO-SCR by NH3 process. And the facile reducibility of these Cu2+ ions can be responsible for the excellent NH3-SCR performance at low temperatures. But moderate and strong acid sites are the main reason for the excellent NH3-SCR activity at high temperature in Cu-zeolite [3]. In addition, CeO2 shell can effectively increase the Lewis acidic sites on the catalyst surface. To be concluded, the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) is proved to be a promising candidate for NH3-SCR due to its uniform distribution of active sites and the synergistic effect of Cu and CeO2 species. 3.3 Catalytic performance The core–shell catalysts were assessed for the SCR reaction compared with the Cu/CeO2 and Cu/ZSM-5. The NO conversion in the presence of H2O measured at a GHSV of ~50,000 h−1 is shown in Fig. 5a. The Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) displays the lowest T 50 (180 °C), followed by Cu/CeO2 (200 °C), Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) (210 °C), and Cu/ZSM-5 (240 °C). The trend is in agreement with the redox properties (verified by H2-TPR and OIE), thus the better redox properties of catalysts can effectively improve the low-temperature activity. In addition, Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample also shows the widest temperature range of 250–500 °C with complete NO conversion, while the activity of Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5), Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/CeO2 samples decrease dramatically when the temperature is higher than 400 °C. This can be ascribed to the non-selective oxidation of NH3, which inhibits the catalytic reduction of NO. The Cu/CeO2 sample with the lowest acidity shows the worst high-temperature activity. Although Cu/ZSM-5 has abundant acid sites, the high-temperature activity is not well. It has been pointed out that low acidity and aggregated metal oxide can accelerate the non-selective oxidation of NH3. Therefore, it can be deduced that the acidity and CuO x clusters are main factors that affecting the high-temperature activity. Combined with H2-TPR and NH3-TPD results, the CeO2 shell in Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample can effectively reduce the CuO x formation and increase the amount of moderate acid sites, while the ZSM-5 core can provide a large amount of acid sites, therefore exhibits the best activity at high temperature. However, the Cu/CeO2 sample shows little NH3 adsorption and thus cannot stabilize NH3 at high temperature. Meanwhile, Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) samples show more CuO x clusters (from TEM and H2-TPR). All of these can lead to the non-selective oxidation of NH3 to NO x . Based on the above observations, it can be proposed that the core–shell structure plays a key role in NH3-SCR reaction, especially for Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. The CeO2 shell interacts with copper ions not only can promote the redox properties, but also prevent the formation of CuO x clusters, and the ZSM-5 core can provide more acid sites to stabilize more NH3 at high temperature. To further evaluate the role of core–shell structure, Cu and Ce impregnated ZSM-5 sample (Cu&Ce/ZSM-5) was prepared and conducted for the purpose of comparison (Fig. 5a). It can be seen that the low-temperature activity of Cu&Ce/ZSM-5 is the same to Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) that is lower than Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample, while the high-temperature activity is near to Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. Therefore, it can be proved that the CeO2 shell in the core–shell structured catalysts play a key role in the NH3-SCR reaction. In order to evaluate the non-selective oxidation of NH3 of these catalysts, the NH3-TPO experiment was carried out (Fig. S4). It can be found that with the NH3 oxidation degree increased, the N2O species signal of Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) and Cu&Ce/ZSM-5 samples increase rapidly, but no obvious changes observed on Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample, which reveals that the non-selective catalytic oxidation of NH3 hardly occurred on Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. N2 yield is an important indicator for evaluating the catalytic activity of catalysts during SCR process. Fig. 5b shows the N2 yield over Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) that corresponding well to NO conversion, while a large amount of by-product N2O can be observed over other samples. Moreover, the catalytic activities of SCR reaction were investigated in the absence of the H2O and the results (Fig. S5) show that the effect of H2O can be almost negligible on the catalytic activity over Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. This benefited from the inhibiting the toxic effect of H2O of CeO2 shell. The CeO2 shell has a certain degree of hydrophobicity, which can promote the rapid migration of water, thereby effectively preventing water from entering the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst [37,38]. Therefore, the adsorption of water on the active sites of the catalyst is inhibited [35]. And the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst shows the best resistance to H2O. The investigation of hydrothermal stability of core–shell structured catalysts is illustrated in Fig. S5c. After hydrothermal aging at 850 °C for 8 h, Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) samples show a significant decrease in activity. However, Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) clearly shows higher conversion compared to the other two materials. Compared with the fresh catalyst, the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst showed a lower T50 (143 °C) after hydrothermal aging. It indicates that the CeO2 shell may be able to protect the skeleton and active sites of copper ions. The XRD and N2 adsorption and desorption characterizations were further used to prove the role of CeO2 shell (Fig. S6 and Fig. S7). It can be found that the crystallinity of Cu/ZSM-5 dropped a lot and the structure of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) is the best preserved, confirming the core–shell structure can protect the skeleton, which is also proved by the specific surface area [SAged-Cu/ZSM-5 (230 m2g−1) < SAged-Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) (242 m2g−1) < SAged-Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) (275 m2g−1)]. The increased CeO2 peak on Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) and Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) samples are due to the agglomeration of CeO2 grains during the hydrothermal treatment. Considering about the poor activity of aged Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample, it can be inferred that the destruction of the copper ions active sites is the key factor causing deactivation. 3.4 Sulfur poisoning resistance In the practical applications, the high SO2 tolerance of catalysts is an important indicator to evaluate the performance of catalysts. In order to study the effect of sulfur on the catalytic activities, NO conversion was investigated in the presence of 200 ppm SO2. As shown in Fig. 5d, the core–shell catalysts of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) and Cu/CeO2 samples exhibited better SO2 tolerance than Cu/ZSM-5 sample, and the NO conversion maintained at around 90% after 5 h. As for Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) and Cu&Ce/ZSM-5 samples, the activity is 10% and 6% lower than Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2), respectively. After SO2 was cutting off from the feed stream, the catalytic activities for all the spent catalysts slightly increase. However, the catalytic activities cannot recover to the initial levels. For Cu-based zeolite catalysts, SO2 poisoning on catalytic activation can be attributed to the formation of ammonium sulfate species depositing on the surface, as well as copper sulfate species blocking the active Cu2+ sites [39]. While deactivation from deposited ammonium sulfate is reversible after high-temperature treatment due to the decomposition of the poisoning species [40], copper sulfate species are significantly more thermally stable with a decomposition temperature greater than 550 °C, which is defined as irreversible deactivation. This can be responsible for that the activities cannot recover to the original level after SO2 cutting off. However, for CeO2, Ce(SO4)2 and Ce2(SO4)3 can be generated under SO2 poisoning. Ce(SO4)2 rather than Ce2(SO4)3 surface was identified to be the most stable poisoning structure in pure CeO2 [41]. In addition, the sulfated ceria species might increase the amount surface hydroxyls, which could supply more Brønsted acids for sulfated Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) [39]. This might be an important reason for the good SCR performance in SO2-containing gas over Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst. CeO2 shell can reduce thermal stabilities of the sulfate species covered on catalyst surface, thereby promoting their decomposition [10]. The presence of CeO2 in the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst can make SO2 firstly deposited on the CeO2 shell to form a less stable Ce sulfate, which can inhibit the formation of ammonium sulfate and copper sulfate on the catalyst surface in the SCR process, improving the excellent sulfur tolerance of the Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst. It has been reported that SO2 can react with NH3 and H2O to form sulfate species ((NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 and (NH4)2SO3) that blocking the copper ions active sites or poisoning copper ions to form CuSO4 and then cut off the reaction pathway [42]. Therefore, further assessment was carried out on the SO2 tolerance tested samples to reveal the inactivation from poisoning. The XRD results show that the structure of the samples before and after the reaction does not change a lot (Fig. S8). However, according to the N2 adsorption and desorption result (Fig. S9), it can be observed that the SSA of reacted samples decreased a lot, especially for Cu/ZSM-5, and its micropore diameter also decreased, which was attributed to the sulfate species deposited on the surface of the sample and blocked part of the pores (Table S1). It is worth noting that the pore volume of Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample after SO2 poisoning reaction reduces the most, indicating that the sulfates deposited not only on the surface of the sample, but also inside the catalyst. Therefore, based on the above characterizations, it can be inferred that the CeO2 shell can react with SO2 firstly to form cerium sulfate species on the surface, and prevent SO2 from entering the inside of catalyst to protect the copper ions active sites. And thus, the SO2 only has a toxic effect on some active sites on the surface of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample, resulting in a slight decrease in activity. In contrast to Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample, the SO2 destroyed the internal structure of catalyst and significantly reduced the activity. To further prove the existence of sulfate species, XPS was used to analyze surface species. As shown in Fig. 6, the surface oxygen, cerium and sulfur species of different samples change diversely after the reaction. In the O 1s XPS result, the reacted Cu/ZSM-5 contained more surface oxygen species compared to the corresponding fresh sample. While for the reacted Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample, almost no change of surface oxygen species can be observed, and a slightly increasing of surface oxygen species was observed in reacted Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. This can be ascribed to the formation of sulfates on the surface of the reacted samples [43]. Only a small change can be observed from the results of Ce 3d XPS. Combined with the ratio of Ce3+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) listed in Table S2, it can be found that the relative content of Ce3+ on the reacted sample were greater than that of the corresponding fresh sample. This is because SO2 can react with CeO2 to form Ce3+, which follows the reaction: [44]. 2CeO2 + 3SO2 + O2 = Ce2(SO4)3 In addition, the photoemission of S 2p can be detected over the reacted samples. Many banding energy peaks were observed at 166.6, 167.4, 168.3, 169.5 and 170.1 eV on reacted Cu/ZSM-5, which were attributed to the ammonium sulfate, aluminum sulfate and copper sulfate species, respectively [45,46]. While on reacted Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample, none peaks could be clearly observed. It is worth noting that only one peak at 168.8 eV related to the cerium sulfate species can be observed on the reacted Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample [47]. According to the above observation, it from a side proves that SO2 preferentially react with CeO2 to form cerium sulfate species in the presence of CeO2. CeO2 shell has greatly inhibited the formation of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate species that poising copper ion active sites. The CeO2 core reacted with SO2 to form inside the catalyst, which was confirmed by the pore volume of reacted Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample (Table S1) that the sulfates blocked the pores of ZSM-5 and further reducing the SCR activity. Due to the limitation of XPS penetration, the sulfate species deposited inside cannot be detected. Thus, no obvious peaks can be observed in the S 2p on Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5) sample. In order to evaluate the effect of SO2 during the SCR process, in situ DRIFTS studies were performed on Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) samples at 200 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the samples were first treated with SCR atmosphere for 40 min, after purging with He for 30 min, 200 ppm SO2 was introduced for different adsorption time. The bands at 1152, 1157, 1193, 1195 and 1208 cm−1 are related to ammonia adsorbed on Lewis acid sites [48]. The bands at 1270 and 1305 cm−1 are attributed to nitrates species [49]. It could be observed that with the increase of time exposure to SCR atmosphere, the nitrate species on the Cu/ZSM-5 sample increased rapidly, and a small amount of NH3 adsorbed on acid sites, while the opposite phenomenon was observed on Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample. This indicates that a large amount of nitrate species deposited on the surface of Cu/ZSM-5 sample, and the CeO2 shell of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample can effectively inhibit the deposition of nitrate. After exposing to SO2, the nitrate species decreased rapidly and several new bands at 1292, 1297, 1315, 1332 cm−1 related to the adsorption of SO2 appeared after 10 min [50]. It is worth noting that in Cu/ZSM-5, the ammonia adsorbed on acid sites decreased in 20 min and then gradually increased with a new band appearing at 1180 cm−1, which can be attributed to the formation of sulfate species ((NH4)2SO4, (NH4)HSO4 et al.) [51]. This reveals that the sulfate species can inhibit the existence of nitrate species. The bands of SO2 adsorption on Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) sample decreased at 40 min, accompanied with a new band appeared at 1108 cm−1 that attributed to cerium sulfate [52], and no formation of other sulfate species was observed. It shows that the presence of cerium sulfate can inhibit the formation of other sulfates, and the CeO2 shell presents a good protective effect on the active sites, showing strong anti-sulfur poisoning performance. 4 Conclusion In the present study, we reported a Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) core–shell structured catalyst exhibiting higher catalytic performance with NO conversion above 90% in the temperature range of 225–550 °C, higher stability, H2O and SO2 tolerance than either Cu/ZSM-5 or Cu/(CeO2@ZSM-5). The CeO2 as shell mainly contributed to low-temperature activity benefiting from the excellent redox property of copper cerium oxides, while the ZSM-5 as mainly contributed to high-temperature activity benefiting from the appropriate acid sites stabilizing the adsorbed NH3. Therefore, the synergy of redox properties and acidity can promote SCR behavior. The SO2 tolerance experiment shows that the CeO2 shell not only restrained the formation of nitrate and ammonia sulfate species to block the pores or active sites but also prevented the generation of copper sulfate, leading to the improvement of SO2 tolerance. The design of core–shell catalysts is effective to enhance the catalytic performance for NH3-SCR process.

        "dc:description": "By constructing core–shell ZSM-5@CeO2 support rather than bulk phase for loading copper, the enhanced NH3-SCR performance as well as H2O and SO2 tolerance was achieved. Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst exhibited the superior activity with the lowest T 90 at 215 °C, which is due to the interaction between CeO2 shell and copper ions that promotes the redox properties as evidenced by oxygen isotopic exchange technique. The ZSM-5 core provides more acid sites to improve the ammonia adsorption. Thus, the highest activity of Cu/(ZSM-5@CeO2) catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of redox ability and acidity. The CeO2 shell can react with SO2 preferentially and lead to a high sulfur tolerance. This study provides a strategy for design and the practical applications of NH3-SCR zeolite catalysts.",
