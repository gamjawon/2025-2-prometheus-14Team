Shah and R.N. Ram* Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, M.S. University of Baroda, Batbda-390002 (India) (Received October 6, 1992; accepted February 16, 1993 ) Abstract A study is reported on the kinetics of hydrogenation of cyclohexene using a polymer-supported ruthenium (III) complex catalyst in methanol in which the influence on the reaction rate of the amount of catalysts, the concentration of cycloheaene, the hydrogen concentration, and temperature has been investigated. A rate expression is proposed, based on the observed initial rate data. The recycling efficiency of the catalysts has also been studied in order to examine the activity of the catalyst. Key words: cyclohexene hydrogenation; ruthenium (III); polymer-supported catalyst Introduction The hydrogenation of organic substrates using transition metal complex catalysts is a subject of both academic and commercial importance. Several studies have been reported of the activity of Group VIII metal complexes as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. A number of ruthenium complexes have been used for the study of various reactions, mainly due to their higher catalytic activity under mild operating condition [ 1 ] . We have earlier reported the activity of polymer-supported Ru (III) complexes in the hydrogenation of olefins [ 2,3 ] . In the present study we report the kinetics of hydrogenation of cyclohexene using polymer-supported Ru (III) catalysts. We have examined the influence on the rate of hydrogenation of various factors, such as the amount of the catalyst, concentration of the cyclohexene as well as the hydrogen concentration and the temperature of the system. A rate equation has been proposed, based on the observed data. *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 68 IN Shah and R.N. Ram/J. Mot Catal. 83 (1993) 67-74 Experimental Synthesis and characterization of the catalyst The detailed procedure for the synthesis and characterization of the catalysts, 30PRu (III) TMDA (Catalyst C) and 20ZKRu (III) -TMDA (Catalyst E), has been described earlier [ 3 ] . Hydrogenation procedure The hydrogenation .reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a magnetically stirred glass reactor in a chemically controlled device [4 ] . The rate of hydrogen consumption was measured using a glass manometric apparatus. The detailed experimental set-up and hydrogenation procedure have been described earlier [ 5 ] . Results and discussion The rate of hydrogenation was calculated from the slope of the plots of volume of H2 absorbed at NTP as a function of time. A summary of the results is given in Tables 1 and 2.

Effect of cyclohexene concentration The influence of cyclohegene concentration on the rate of reaction for catalysts C and E has been studied and the results are given in Tables 1 and 2. The rate of reaction increases with an increase in the concentration of substrate, keeping the Ru(III) concentration constant. The plot of log (initial rate) against log [ cyclohegene ] at a fixed concentration of the catalyst, hydrogen pressure and temperature is found to be linear (Fig. 1) . This indicates that reaction follows first-order kinetics with respect to cyclohegene concentration. Influence of catalyst concentration The influence of catalyst concentration on the rate of hydrogenation of cyclohexene has been studied for catalysts C and E. The results are given in Tables 1 and 2. In both the cases the rate of reaction is found to increase with the catalyst concentration in the range studied. The order of reaction with respect to concentration of catalyst was calculated from the slope of the plots of log (initial rate) versus log [catalyst] at fixed concentration of substrate, hydrogen pressure and temperature and is 70 JN Shah and R.N Ram/J.

Although the reaction was carried out in a chemically controlled regime, choosing a suitable swelling agent, the observed fractional order may be due to the inaccessibility of catalytic sites and ateric hindrance. Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the rate of hydrogenation for both polymer bound ruthenium complexes has been studied in the range of 30-50 C and the results are given in Tables 1 and 2. The energy of activation calculated from the slope of an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 3) was found to be 5.89 and 5.15 kcal mol-1 for catalyst C and E, respectively. This indicates that the reaction is fast, which was also found experimentally. Influence of hydrogen concentration in solution Fig. 4 illustrates the influence of hydrogen concentration in methanol for both catalysts, and for fixed concentration of catalyst and substrate at 35 C. It can be seen that the rate increases with fractional order of hydrogen concentration. Life cycle of catalyst In order to study the activity of the catalyst, its recycling efficiency was tested. -1.e 0 -1.7- -1.s ~\\ -- -LB ~\\\\ . 0 -1.8 v \\ D \\ v \\ p -1.9 \\~K -2.0 \\'Q E -2.0 -2.2 2.1 -2.4 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 T n 103 K Fig. 3.

Influence of amount of hydrogen on the rate of hydrogenation of cyclohexene for catalysts C and E. The experiment was carried out at 35 C for about 9 h by injecting a known amount of substrate (i.e. 10p1) at 60 min intervals. The rate of hydrogenation was measured with time for both used and fresh catalysts. The results are summarized in Table 3. A decrease in the rate was found after each cycle. The loss of the activity of the catalyst may be due to the leaching of the metal ions present on the surface, which has already been estimated [ 2 ] . Rate equation The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation over a ruthenium catalyst has been extensively studied [ 6-8 ] . The formation of hydrido species, and perferential attachment of olefin to the ruthenium hydrido complex have been well established by various experimental studies and thermodynamic properties [ 8,9 ] . On the basis of this evidence from the literature, the following mechanism and rate equation are proposed: [RuTMDACl2]Cl+H2 ~ [RuTMDA(H)Cl]Cl+HCl [RUTMDA(H)Cl]Cl+S s~ [RuTMDA(HS)Cl]Cl [RuTMDA(HS)Cl]Cl+H2 _ [RuTMDA(H)Cl]Cl+alkane JN Shah and R.N.

Conclusions The polymer-bound catalysts are stable and catalyst C was found to be more active and stable than catalyst E.
