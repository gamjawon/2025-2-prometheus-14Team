In the case of nickel, the transition metal species were attached to crosslinked polystyrene resins through a carbon atom of the P/O chelate ligand. The formation of high molecular weight linear polyethylene is discussed in comparison to homogeneous analogs giving oligomeric products under the same conditions. Titanium containing species on the MgC12 surface are obtained by coprecipitating the metals from solution of their alcoholates or carboxylates. These species are shown to be sensitive to the presence of carboxylate ligands which affect the catalytic process. Finally biscyclopentadienyl dichloro or dimethyl zirconium have been supported on modified HY zeolite to give catalysts showing the same activity as the homogeneous analogs but higher stability during the polymerization reactions. General aspects deriving from these results are discussed with reference to the possibility of improving the design of well defined physically heterogeneous catalysts.

Introduction Catalysis is characterized by the continuous and productive competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. While these concepts were in the past simply associated with soluble and insoluble systems, respectively, nowadays multiphase systems can be also considered as homogeneous catalysts provided activity is due to monosite species. This concept becomes even broader in catalyzed oligomerization and polym- erization as even monosite systems can yield prod- ucts consisting of chain where all monomeric units * Corresponding author. t This paper is at the same time coauthored by Prof. Giuseppe Braca (deceased 5 August 1994) and dedicated in fond memory. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDlI3gl-I169(95)00167-0 have the same chemical structure but with differ- ent molecular weight due to the occurrence of chain transfer reactions. Attachment of metal complexes to a support [ 1 ] is one of the most efficient routes to chemically homogeneous but physically heterogeneous catalysts. In this general context the present paper deals with our recent approaches to prepare supported polymerization catalysts with controlled structure of the active sites. Both organic (crosslinked pol- ystyrene) and inorganic (MgC12 and zeolite) sup- ports have been used with nickel, titanium and zirconium as transition metal species. The refer- 114 G.

The anchoring of alkyl or hydride nickel com- plexes to polystyrene resin through a carbon atom of the chelate P/O ligand gave catalysts producing linear polyethylene having the same morphology as the polymeric support beads [ 3 ]. The forma- tion of high molecular weight macromolecules instead of oligomers obtained in solution with the same complexes was attributed to the bidentate firm coordination of nickel to the polymer. The role of P/O chelate ligand and resins as well as of the type and amount of ancillary ligand around the nickel are discussed with reference to the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. The catalytic polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization with a-olefins were also inves- tigated in the presence of both Group IV transition metal complexes supported on MgC12 and metal- locene complexes supported on silica or zeolite Y. In the former case it has been shown that the supported transition metal species can be modu- lated in their catalytic activity by the coordination of organic ligands. Thus addition of carboxylic acids modifies catalytic performances due to the coordination on the transition metal atoms. Better defined catalytic species supported on the inorganic surface are obtained in case of metal- locene complexes. In order to avoid destructive reactions between the biscyclopentadienyl dich- loro or dimethyl zirconium complex and the BrCnsted acid species on the surface of the inor- ganic support, this last was pretreated with AI(CH3)3 or C1Si(CH3)3. In this way substan- tially unmodified zirconocene complexes were supported on the surface or entrapped within the pores of the zeolite. These complexes can be acti- vated with aluminum alkyls or methylalumoxane, this last giving a larger activity. The catalysts behave as monosite heterogeneous systems for monoalkene polymerization. The main results concerning the above systems are described in this paper by discussing sepa- rately non Ziegler-Natta nickel catalyst supported on crosslinked polystyrene and titanium carbox- ylate or zirconocene supported respectively on MgCI2 and HY zeolite and activated with alumi- num cocatalysts (Ziegler-Natta catalysts). 2. Polystyrene supported nickel catalysts Homogeneous nickel catalysts have been exten- sively studied in the oligomerization and polym- erization of olefins without cocatalysts (non Ziegler-Natta catalysts) by many authors: particularly chelate nickel complexes resulted very active in ethylene oligomerization to give predominantly linear products [4-9]. In the last five years our attempts in this field were devoted to heterogenize these complexes by the anchoring to crosslinked polystyrene resins through a carbon atom of the chelate ligand, yield- ing structures of the type I. (1) The heterogenization of the complexes caused a very drastic change of the catalytic process, as ethylene polymerization instead of oligomeriza- tion was observed [ 3 ]. To better elucidate the role played by the nature of the polymeric chelating group and of the ancillary ligand new heterogen- ized nickel catalysts were synthesized by reaction of functionalized polystyrenes with a suitable nickel precursor. In this way the ylidic systems (II) were obtained, where L can be a phosphine, a phosphite, a nitrogen base and so on [3,10]. ~ ----CH=PPh3 + L, + Ni(cod)2 toluene Ph~.p/Ph ,o/ L (II) G.

The catalytic systems are found to be active also in the absence of ancillary ligands, but their pres- ence stabilized the catalytic complex preventing the decomposition to metal. An excess of ancillary ligand is detrimental to the catalytic activity, probably due to the forma- tion of inactive phosphinated nickel species (Table 1). Strongly basic phosphines depressed the activ- ity as observed for homogeneous ylidic systems, while an increase of the steric hindrance had a positive role. Preactivation with hydrogen reduced the induc- tion period, favoring the formation of the active nickel hydride. In addition, the catalyst heterogenized by anchoring the phosphino acetate moiety to a pol- ystyrene matrix (III) was found to be active in the polymerization of ethylene to HDPE with rep- lication of the support morphology. In fact when the polymeric support was a powdered resin pol- yethylene was obtained as a powder whilst using a microspherical resin as support, polyethylene spheres (th---5 mm) were formed. Also in this case the polyethylene characteristics were quite analogous to those observed with ylidic hetero- geneous systems: in every case polydispersity 116 G.

The origin of this behaviour is not clear at present; both metal species with different environment and access to the substrate can play a certain role. The catalytic activity observed for heterogeni- zed phosphinoacetate systems was lower than that for the ylidic ones (Table 2) similarly to the respective homogeneous systems in ethylene olig- omerization [5 ]. For these chelate catalysts the presence of added phosphine ligand seemed unnecessary: no decomposition is observed in the runs carded out without any ligand, and only lowering of the activ- ity was ascertained. Moreover the preactivation step under hydrogen appeared detrimental, caus- ing a partial reduction to Ni(0). To gain better insight into the effect played by the rigid chelating ligand in the previously described heterogenized systems, the heterogeni- zed non-chelate phosphino carboxylate nickel cat- alysts (IV and V) were tested (Table 2) [12]. Rather surprisingly these last systems were always active in ethylene oligomerization. They also appeared less stable than the chelate complexes. A decomposition mechanism involving the phos- phine ligand dissociation was ascertained, which could be prevented by preparing the catalyst under ethylene atmosphere. The results reported up to now allow a better clarification of the respective roles of the chelate part and of the ancillary ligand in the proposed catalytic mechanism of the heterogenized system depicted in Scheme 1. The polymeric nature of the chelate ligand blocks the bidentate coordination to the nickel centre and makes the chelation rigid and probably irreversible. This bidentate firm coordination greatly favours the polymerization over oligomerization which requires a vacant coordination site for t-extraction of the hydrogen (step C) [ 13]. In contrast, when the phosphine and the carboxylic moieties are bonded in a non- chelate arrangement, the coordination of the phos- phino group becomes reversible and oligomers are formed. The ancillary ligand L is not always necessary for the activation of the heterogeneous chelate complexes (II) and (III) and is involved only in the formation of the active hydride species from the precursor (step A). Once displaced by ethyl- ene from the nickel centre (step B), the ancillary ligands become ineffective for the process selectivity. These results are quite different from those observed for analogous homogeneous complexes, where the ancillary ligand coordination appears to be reversible and the chelating ligand is involved in a reversible opening---closing equilibrium which G.

Ziegler-Natta catalysts on inorganic support As mentioned in the Introduction the original objective of the heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts was to fix on an insoluble support well defined catalytic species, that is, complexes hav- ing the same chemical structure as the starting soluble system [ 1 ]. More than 25 years of inves- tigation in this field have demonstrated that this was very difficult and was achieved only rarely, whereas in many cases supported catalysts not only had different physical properties but also a different chemical structure. Therefore at present the heterogenization of organometallic catalyst is a way for preparing new catalysts with controlled structure and behaviour rather than a simple way to physical heterogenization. This aspect is partic- ularly true when the organometallic species are derived from the conventional Ziegler-Natta cat- alyst preparation, while they can be approached more properly starting with metallocene systems. In the early work by Ziegler [ 14] and Natta [ 15 ], these systems have been considered as het- erogeneous catalysts. Accordingly Natta [ 15] was able to show the importance of crystalline TIC13 with active organometallic species based on alkyl-titanium species on the surface, for deter- mining both catalytic activity and isotactic ster- eospecificity in case of monosubstituted ethylene monomers. In the present work results from our laboratory will be reviewed in the frame of the relevant lit- erature in order to provide some insight into the possibility of obtaining active sites on inorganic supports where the catalytic activity can be influ- enced by ligands around the transition metal atom. Indeed, previous work concerning MgC12 sup- ported Ti/Hf catalysts activated with trialkylalu- minum had shown that addition of carboxylic acids narrows the molecular weight distribution (MWD) due to selective complexation of active sites producing low molecular weight chains [ 16]. In order to confirm the presence on the active sites of the carboxylate ligand, optically active carboxylic acids such as (+)(R)-3,7- dimethyl-6-octenoic acid (C4) and (+)(S)-2- phenylbutanoic acid (PB) were used for the catalyst preparation. The catalyst was prepared by treatment with aluminum alkylchlorides of Ti-car- boxylates solutions with analogous Mg-deriva- tives giving coprecipitation of Ti and Mg chlorinated products. FT-IR analysis indicated the presence of carboxylate in the catalyst, mainly bound to titanium as a bidentate ligand [ 17]. A molar ratio carboxylic acid/Ti = 1 was detected by chemical analysis. The catalyst prepared from the optically active acid induces the formation of optically active pol- ymers due to the preferential (stereo-elective) [ 18 ] polymerization of the R enantiomer of race- mic o~-olefins having the asymmetric carbon in the 118 G.

PB gives better results than C4 thus suggesting the importance of the distance of the chiral carbon atom from the carboxylic group and then from titanium. This would be clearly effec- tive if either the acid is attached (or complexed) to the active sites or promotes the formation of inherently chiral sites during catalyst coprecipi- tation. The effect is larger for DMO than for 4MH, and increases with decreasing the temperature from 20 to - 30 (Table 3). Fractionation with boiling solvents of the pol- ymers obtained at 20 by polymerizing 4MH indicates that the stereo-electivity is connected to the stereospecific centers giving high molecular weight macromolecules (Table 4). The lower optical rotation, in absolute values, of the cyclo- hexane extracted fraction with respect to the die- thyl ether extracted fraction is connected to the higher stereoselectivity of more isotactic specific active centers. These data confirm the presence of carboxylate ligands around the titanium in the active sites. Therefore starting with selected Ti-complexes it is possible to support better defined species on MgC12 by coprecipitation [2,16]. Indeed even if a precise structure cannot be determined these results strongly support the attachment of titanium species bearing bidentate carboxylate ligands, to a MgC12 support, which are successively con- R R / / jC jC o I o --Mg CI~ ] /O --Mg CI~ [ /O Ti + Al(C2Hs)3 ~ Ti -~ --Mg C1/ [ ~C1 --Mg C1/ [ ~ C2H5 X X Scheme 2.

Previous studies using silica as support for dif- ferent titanium and zirconium complexes active as homogeneous catalysts for ethylene polymeri- zation [ 19] did not give clear results. Indeed in some cases removal of the metallocene ligand was observed [ 20], and the activity was dependent on preparation conditions [21,22], thus confirming the formation of non definite species on the sur- face of the inorganic support. In this context HY-zeolite appeared to be a more suitable support because of the well characterized structure and the possibility of entrapping in the pores organometallic complexes. In this connec- tion the catalyst preparation was performed start- ing with biscyclopentadienyl zirconium complexes and HY zeolite. Cp2ZrC12 supported on merely thermally treated HY-zeolite displays (Table 5) rather ~ Si--OH + AI(CH3)3 \\ Si-- OH + Cp2Zr(CH3)2 / modest activity with aluminum trialkyls, which is substantially improved by using MAt, even if remaining below the value obtained in solution under similar conditions. As this result could be in some way connected to a modification of Zr- complex through reaction with the silanol func- tionalities, the zeolite was pretreated with A1Me3 [20]. This reaction occurs with methane evolu- tion and conversion of all -OH groups into Si-O- AI oxane species [23] as indicated in the Scheme 3. On this modified support the catalyst shows improved activity (one order of magnitude) both with A1Me3 and with MAt; in the last case the productivity ( S.A. = 2,800 kg/mol Zr. h with A1/ Zr= 1500 molar ratio) was comparable to that expected for the analogous complex in solution. Also good activity was obtained in the ethylene/ propene copolymerization, with about 20% tool of a-olefin in the copolymer. In toluene solution Cp2ZrC12 with MAt (A1/Zr=1500) gave S.A. = 2,200 kg/mol Zr. h with 20% mol propene in the final product (Table 5). To confirm the possibility of supporting the unmodified metallocene, Cp2ZrMe2 and more thoroughly purified HY-zeolite were used because even the dealuminated zeolite contains extrafra- mework aluminum. Biscyclopentadienyl dimethyl zirconium is in some way a simplified derivative as it eliminates the presence of chlorine. Moreover it is a probable intermediate product during catalyst preparation starting with Cp2ZrC12 as the latter can be methylated by methylalumox- ane in the activation step. Also, its interaction with silanol groups still present on the support could -~SiuOBAI(CH3)2 + CH4 Scheme 3. Cp \\ I :- ~ Si-- O-- Zr- CH3 + CH4 / I Cp Scheme 4. 120 G. Braca et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 113-121 be easily shown by methane evolution (Scheme 4). The resulting/x-oxo zirconium species are inac- tive for polymerization; therefore the above reac- tion would be accompanied by a decrease of productivity. Extraframework aluminum can be removed by exhaustive extraction at 50 with a solution of acetylacetone in ethanol [ 24]. After this treatment the 27A1-NMR (MAS) spectrum shows a single resonance at 57.45 ppm of the tetrahedral A1, whereas resonances at 0 and 30--50 ppm of the extraframework A1 are completely lacking. How- ever silanol groups are still present and treatment with Cp2ZrMe2 is accompanied by CH4 evolution associated with cleavage of the Zr-carbon bond. The zeolite was then treated with a 2 M solution of A1Me3 in toluene and successively washed with dry toluene until the test for aluminum was neg- ative; the resulting support in the 27A1-NMR (MAS) spectrum shows three resonances at 60.4, 33.1 and 2.2 ppm, suggesting that two different species of aluminum, associated with absorbed AIMe3 and the reaction product of A1Me3 with silanol groups, are now present. The addition of Cp2ZrMe2 to the modified zeo- lite does not evolve any CH4, and the 27A1-NMR (MAS) spectrum shows the same resonances as before the addition of zirconocene. Also, in the 29Si-NMR (MAS) spectrum only the resonance of the Si(OA1) species at -107 ppm can be observed, indicating that no change occurred for Si after addition of the zirconocene to the zeolite pretreated with A1Me3. Therefore it is likely that the zirconocene maintains its original structure when supported on this modified HY-zeolite (HY* *). This catalyst with MAO as cocatalyst gave comparable activity to that in solution and needed comparable amounts of MAO, as expected by the fixation on surface and inside the channels of the zeolite [25 ] of unmodified species. Replacement of A1Me3 with Me3SiC1 for HY** pretreatment gave a support without free silanol groups and extraframework aluminum. With this last support no activity was detected for Cp2ZrMe2 in the pres- ence of A1Me3 cocatalyst, whereas with MAO analogous productivity was achieved as with the HY* *-A1Me3 support, indicating the similar structure of the supported species without any involvement of aluminum species on the surface. Interesting differences exist between time dependence of polymerization rate with soluble and zeolite-supported species in the case of Cp2ZrMe2. The soluble system is initially more active than the supported one, but shows a typical decay profile of polymerization rate (Rp) vs. time. By contrast Rp of the zeolite supported system remains almost constant in the first 60 min and already after 20 min is higher than that for the soluble catalyst. The comparable productivity of the zeolite supported catalysts with respect to the corresponding systems in solution, despite the lower initial activity, is therefore a consequence of the better stability of the active sites in the former systems [22]. These preliminary results show that the use of properly treated zeolite supports allow us to obtain heterogenized zirconocene species showing appreciable activity with constant Rp, indicating that entrapment in the zeolite channels prevents deactivation reactions and allows the modulation of catalytic activity by molecular modification of the support without preventing activation by MAO. 3. Concluding remarks As anticipated in the Introduction the main objective of the work described in the present paper was to indicate the possibility of obtaining well defined and structurally homogeneous metal complexes catalysts fixed on a solid support, con- sisting of either an organic resin or inorganic materials. The data reported indicate that crosslinked pol- ystyrene appears to be suitable to be functionali- zed with chemical species which can act as ligands for fixation of transition metals to give structurally uniform catalytic species. The inorganic matrices can present different sites due to the solid structure G. Brac a et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 ( 19961 113-121 121 and characteristics of the surface. Chemical treat- ment with specific reagents can give some improvement of selected properties, depending on the nature of inorganic surface and type of organ- ometallic species. In this case the inorganic sup- ports can also offer the possibility of fixing the unaltered organometallic complex through weak bonding or absorption. This area needs more work both on the structure and surface properties of supports and on the suit- able processes to obtain controlled fixation. How- ever it is mature enough to show the validity of the idea of hybrid catalysts developed by the series of SHHC conferences looking at systems which join chemical homogeneity to physical heterogeneity.

This paper describes the preparation of some active organometallic species derived from nickel, titanium and zirconium fixed on the surface of different supports and their behaviour for the catalytic polymerization of ethylene. In the case of nickel, the transition metal species were attached to crosslinked polystyrene resins through a carbon atom of the P O chelate ligand. The formation of high molecular weight linear polyethylene is discussed in comparison to homogeneous analogs giving oligomeric products under the same conditions. Titanium containing species on the MgCl2 surface are obtained by coprecipitating the metals from solution of their alcoholates or carboxylates. These species are shown to be sensitive to the presence of carboxylate ligands which affect the catalytic process. Finally biscyclopendienyl dichloro or dimethyl zirconium have been supported on modified HY zeolite to give catalysts showing the same activity as the homogeneous analogs but higher stability during the polymerization reactions. General aspects deriving from these results are discussed with reference to the possibility of improving the design of well defined physically heterogeneous catalysts.
