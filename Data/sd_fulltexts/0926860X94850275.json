At 310, and 500 psi on feeding synthesis gas ( CO/H2 = 1 / 1 ), the carbon monoxide conversion levels are comparable but selectivities are quite different. Mn203 displays over 90% selectivity for methanol while MnO displays less than 10% selectivity for methanol but over 50% selectivity for carbon dioxide. Patterns of activity and selectivity are discussed for each of the precursors. Interestingly, despite the quite varied selec- tivities at comparable conversion levels, X-ray diffraction on the used catalysts indicates that each has been converted to MnO in the bulk as would be expected from thermodynamics.

Introduction Manganese is an abundant metal with physical and chemical properties and behavior similar to those of iron. With a wide range of attainable oxidation states, manganese has been valued as a component of batteries but also of industrial catalysts. For oxidative processes manganese is often utilized; examples include the conversion of hydrocarbons [1 ] and the oxidative coupling of methane [2]. Manganese also plays a role in reductive catalysis, as a promoter in combination with cobalt and iron, for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and in the water-gas shift reaction [ 3,4]. It has been reported that manganese is a useful promoter of rhodium catalysts, used to convert synthesis gas to oxygenates [5]. Although the role of manganese is not defined precisely, a tilted surface intermediate of carbon mon- * Corresponding author Tel. ( + 1-302) 8316856, fax.

In this context it is interesting to recall that manganese oxide was a major component of catalysts used in the early, high-pressure synthesis process for production of methanol and higher alcohols [7,8]. More recently it has been reported that inclusion of manganese oxide in mixed oxides comprised of copper and zinc along with other metals, leads to high-activity catalysts for the conversion of synthesis gas into higher alcohols, including isobutanol [9]. Results from those studies imply that manganese may not only promote chain growth but also may enhance the thermal stability of copper [10]. Each of these studies, particularly those involving manganese and other metal oxides for higher alcohol synthesis, pointed to the intriguing behavior of manganese either as a catalyst or catalyst promoter. Yet we found that the literature offered little information about the inherent activities of manganese oxides for carbon monoxide reduction. As one of the transition metals with the most variability in its oxidation state, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the properties of the manganese oxides and their catalytic behavior would be needed in order to develop new catalytic materials to meet different technological objectives. Cer- tainly, the recent report of the structure and activity of manganese octahedral molecular sieves points to the new opportunities that these oxides may offer as catalysts and as adsorbents [ 11,12]. It was with these factors in mind that we set out to examine the intrinsic activities of several different manganese oxides with different oxidation states and structures. 2. Materials The series of manganese oxides examined in this work were provided by Che- metals, Inc. The physical properties of each sample are listed in Table 1. 3. Experimental Manganese oxide catalyzed carbon monoxide hydrogenation was carried out in a high-pressure down-flow, fixed bed, tubular reactor. The dimensions of the stain- Mure Te, Henry C.

Carbon monoxide and hydrogen (High purity, Matheson) were purified on line and metered into the reactor through separate mass flow controllers. Temperature and pressure of the reactor were controlled precisely by a temperature controller and back pressure regulator. The exit gas flow was transferred through a heated line at 150 to avoid product condensation and then to auto-sampling valves on thermal conductivity and flame ionization detection gas chromatographs. The concentrations of reactants and the products were calibrated using a standard gas. Carbon monoxide conver- sions were calculated from the ratio of the total number of moles of converted carbon to the total number of moles of carbon in the effluent gas. Product selectiv- ities were calculated as: the fraction of the number of moles of carbon in each product to the total number of moles of converted carbon, either with carbon dioxide included or excluded as a product. The amount of catalyst charged was 2 g for each test. Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced at 300 with 30 to 40 sccm of hydrogen for 3 h. The carbon monoxide hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 200 to 350 and 300 to 500 psi (1 psi = 6.895 kPa), and at a total flow-rate of 40 sccm (CO/H2 = 1/1 ). Chemisorption experiments were carried out in a volumetric chemisorption unit with high purity CO, H2, and CO2 as probe gases. Each sample was reduced at 300 with flowing hydrogen for 3 h, and degassed at 10 -5 Ton\" ( 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) overnight before chemisorption of the probe gases. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a XRG-3000 diffractometer with Cu Kot radiation (45 kV and 40 mA). 4. Results of reaction test and discussion 4.1. Variation in activity and selectivity with O/Mn ratio The manganese oxide samples tested included MnO, Mn304, Mn203, and MnO2. Physical properties data for each sample are collected in Table 1, along with their initial oxygen-to-manganese ratios and their initial phases, so identified by X-ray diffraction. Steady-state conversions were obtained for nearly 45-50 h after the first 5 to 10 h on stream (see Fig. 1 ). The stable, steady-state activities indicate that Mn203 and Mn304 were the most active oxides followed by MnO2 and MnO. The total reaction rates for carbon monoxide conversion calculated on a per gram (initial weight) basis are collected in Table 2. Interestingly, although the initial surface areas of the samples vary by a factor of 50 (98.0 versus 2.2 m2/g) the total range of activities on a weight basis varies by no more than a factor of two, and the two most active catalysts do not have the highest initial surface areas. A better correlation exists between the initial oxygen-to-manganese (O/Mn) ratio and the overall activity (see Fig. 2), showing that at intermediate values (O/Mn = 1.5) the reaction rate maximizes. 10.00% T 4 9.00% I 8.00% l = 7.00% .o 6.00o/0 ; O~J-- \" 5.00% o I O 0 4.00% i 3.00% 2.00% 1.00% 0.00% % I i i r I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Reaction Time (hours) Fig. 1.

Methanol selectivity versus initial oxygen-to-manganese ratio. carbon dioxide and methane selectivities result. The higher carbon dioxide and C1, C2 and C3 hydrocarbon selectivities over the MnO catalyst compared to the other manganese oxides tested, indicate that water-gas shift and Fischer-Tropsch catal- ysis dominate on this material. From Figs. 3 and 5 it can be seen that methanol selectivities on Mn203 and MnO2 are very similar. When we include carbon dioxide as a product, Mn203 exhibits even higher methanol selectivity than MnO2 (Fig. 4). This is due to the fact that the carbon dioxide yield is too low to be detected on the Mn203 catalyst, implying that it has reduced water-gas shift activity and a high propensity to convert carbon dioxide to methanol. This is precedented by the finding that methanol formation proceeds through carbon dioxide and surface formates on the copper zinc oxide catalysts [ 13,14] and also on zirconium oxides [ 15,16]. It seems logical that the active sites on all of these oxides may contain a low valent manganese species after reduction. This can be concluded from the fact that ( 1 ) these oxides show higher catalytic activity either after longer reduction times or with longer times on stream, (2) the color of most of the used catalysts is light green, which is quite different from their original colors, and (3) when the used catalysts were contacted with air they reacted vigorously and exothermally. How- ever, the lowest selectivity toward methanol was displayed by native MnO, the oxide with the lowest bulk O/Mn ratio. This implies that the surface active phase for methanol formation on these catalysts does not involve the same surface phase as that of MnO, but rather one that may be derived in the course of reduction from the higher oxidation state manganese precursors. XRD analyses have shown that all the manganese oxides exhibit only MnO features after use in the carbon mon- oxide hydrogenation reaction, except on the used Mn304 and MnO2-CuO sample, for which the XRD also shows minor signatures of Mn304, which are marked by asterisks in Fig. 6. It is also observed by XRD that the reduction of the manganese 1600 1400 1200 .>, 1000 m e.. 800 C 600 400 200 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 20 Fig. 6.

This evidence points to a surface-active phase for carbon monoxide hydrogenation derived from the more highly oxidized manganese oxides that is a low oxidation state manganese oxide species, but one which is not the same as that on the surface of native MnO. According to the thermochemistry of manganese oxides [ 17 ], each of the higher manganese oxides tested could be reduced to MnO but not to Mn under these reduction conditions. The order of reducibility is: MnO2 ( 170, H2) > Mn203 (300, H2) > MnO (to Mn at high temp.). Because Mn304 can be formulated as MnO- Mn203, its reducibility would be expected to be between that of MnO and Mn203. This sequence of reducibilities also correlates with the observed variations in methanol selectivities properly. It was expected that the presence of CuO would produce some improvement in the activity of MnO2, since copper is one of the active components in the industrial methanol synthesis catalyst. Indeed, 1.9 wt.-% copper does increase the activity of the catalyst (see Fig. 1 and Table 2); an equal initial mass of MnOz-CuO displays twice the carbon monoxide conversion of MnO2 at the same reaction conditions. More importantly the selectivity to methanol remains quite high, nearly as high as that of MnO2 alone despite the boost in activity. This result is in good agreement with the established fact that the presence of copper is critical to the active phase of the industrial methanol synthesis catalysts [ 1 ]. The increased activity of MnO2- CuO indicates that some reduced copper species must be formed on the surface, however at only 1.9 wt.-% Cu, its signature is not observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the used sample.

Apparent activation energies and chemisorption Apparent activation energy measurements taken at steady state (Table 3), show that the total activation energies for carbon monoxide hydrogenation on the catalysts decrease from 110 kJ/mol to as low as 25 kJ/mol with an increase in the initial O/ Mn ratios from 1 to 2. For C1 to C4 hydrocarbons formation, the activation barriers are similar and fairly high for all the catalysts, but the activation barriers for methanol formation on these catalysts decreased markedly with the increase in initial O/Mn ratios (Table 3 and Fig. 7). Chemisorption studies indicate that all of these manganese oxides show unde- tectable levels of hydrogen chemisorption and very low carbon monoxide chemi- sorption, but relatively high carbon dioxide chemisorption at room temperature (Tables 4 and 5). This implies that the carbon monoxide hydrogenation on man- ganese oxides may be carried out by a different pathway than that of reduced transition metal catalysts, since the latter always show relatively high uptakes of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Thus it seems possible that the reduction of carbon monoxide over the active manganese oxides may proceed through a carbonate- formate mechanism similar to that on CuO-ZnO. 100 90 80 70 0 60 v 50 40 t~ I,M 30 20 10 0 i i i i 0.8 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.2 O/Mn ratio Fig. 7.

Conclusions These results demonstrate interesting and unanticipated aspects of the intrinsic properties of manganese oxide catalysts. All of the manganese oxides display remarkably stable activities for carbon monoxide hydrogenation to methanol. Mn203 and MnO2 provide high selectivities to methanol, while that of MnO is somewhat lower. The strong correlation between the initial O/Mn ratio of the catalyst precursor and its methanol selectivity is intriguing, since each of these oxides is reduced under reaction conditions to MnO. Yet in native form, not that produced by in situ reduction of a higher oxide, MnO shows much lower methanol selectivity and higher activity for carbon dioxide production. This indicates that with higher O/Mn ratios in the precursor oxide, a different surface active phase must result upon reduction which leads to higher selectivities toward methanol. This is supported by the drop in activation energy for methanol production from ca. 92 kJ/mol on MnO to 25 kJ/mol on MnO2. Even though the bulk structure of these oxides are MnO after reduction and use, their activities and selectivities indicate that their surface active phases are different. MnO as received leads to carbon dioxide, presumably via the water-gas shift reaction. Reduced MnO2, Mn304 and Mn203 lead to methanol. Logically, upon reduction, each of these oxides must lose oxygen from their lattices to go to MnO. In the reactor this is done under comparatively mild conditions, so it is likely that reorganization of the solid structures to accommodate oxide anion loss is at best slow if it proceeds at all. Thus it seems reasonable that the in-situ reduction of the oxides may lead to a highly defect-laden structure of MnO. The higher the initial O/Mn ratio the higher the defect density in the catalyst, and the higher the selectivity for methanol as opposed to carbon dioxide. These results would suggest that dif- ferences in defect density may underlie the differences in selectivity. Given that the pathways for methanol formation and the water-gas shift reactions involve similar intermediates, the defect density may play a crucial role in determining which product is ultimately favored. Promotion of MnO2 with copper at the level of just 1.9 wt.-% led to more than a doubling of the activity of MnO2 and the selectivity to methanol remained high. Furthermore, the catalyst was tested at 310 for 50 h on stream and yet there was no evidence for copper agglomeration based either on X-ray diffraction of the used catalyst or its activity versus time profile. Manganese oxide may thermally stabilize copper, a result that is suggested by earlier work [9] and which deserves closer examination and scrutiny.

Intrinsic reactivities of manganese oxides for carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalysis Mure Te Henry C. Foley * Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA * Corresponding author. Tel. (+1-302) 8316856, fax. (+1-302) 8312085. A comparison is made between the activities and selectivities of several native manganese oxides (MnO, Mn3O4, Mn2O3, MnO2, Cu-MnO2) for carbon monoxide reduction. At 310°C, and 500 psi on feeding synthesis gas (CO/H2 =1/1), the carbon monoxide conversion levels are comparable but selectivities are quite different. Mn2O3 displays over 90% selectivity for methanol while MnO displays less than 10% selectivity for methanol but over 50% selectivity for carbon dioxide. Patterns of activity and selectivity are discussed for each of the precursors. Interestingly, despite the quite varied selectivities at comparable conversion levels, X-ray diffraction on the used catalysts indicates that each has been converted to MnO in the bulk as would be expected from thermodynamics.
