Graphical abstract Manganese oxides are promising water oxidation catalysts that have attracted great interest in the fuel cell industry. Previous studies have investigated differences in electrode activity based on the phases of MnO2 involved determining structures and composition ex-situ. Here we compare two preparations of MnO2 films, with differing catalytic activities as prepared, and observe morphological changes as a function of increasingly oxidizing potentials using in-operando Raman spectroscopy. We find that the Raman spectra of the films, both as-deposited and in solution, can be modelled as a binary mixture of amorphous manganese oxide and pure-phase cryptomelane that develop greater cryptomelane (α-MnO2) character as the oxidizing potential increases in 1M KOH. Analyzing the Raman spectra using classical least squares fitting, we determine that both films converge on a cryptomelane score of approximately 0.25; concurrently their catalytic activities improve. These results suggest that significant variations in electrocatalytic activity arise from short range ordering in the catalyst that is not easily determined using ex-situ structure determination. Keywords Water oxidation Manganese oxide Electrolysis Oxygen evolution Raman spectroscopy Abbreviations SEM scanning electron microscopy XRD X-ray diffraction CLS classical least squares The production of effective catalysts for the evolution of oxygen from water has been of great interest to the electrocatalysis community in recent years due to their potential impact on renewable energies applications [1], this is because overcoming the energy barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction remains one of the challenges impeding the commercial adoption of water-splitting devices. Many materials have been investigated as potential catalysts, among them particular attention has been given to active electrode materials not requiring precious metals [2]. In photosynthesis, this is accomplished with a CaMn4O5 cluster in photosystem II (PSII) [3–5], inspiring a great deal of interest in manganese oxides as potential electrode materials [5–8]. However, as manganese oxide is known to naturally occur in at least 30 different structures [9], much of that research has understandably focused on determining which manganese oxides hold the most promise as catalysts. It has been previously shown that the active phase differs according to the application, with varying oxidation processes favoring different structures [10]. For electrocatalysis, the α phase of MnO2, corresponding to the mineral cryptomelane, has been shown to be the most active and stable performer, ahead of amorphous manganese oxide [11], which is itself more active than other MnO2 phases and intermediate in activity between α-Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 [12]. In those studies, it was noted that many phases of manganese oxide show slight improvements in catalytic activity during operation [11]. This has been attributed to possible morphological changes in the catalysts as the reaction proceeds [10]. Although some before and after analyses have been performed on the catalyst samples used in those experiments, to our knowledge little experimental characterization of the changes in solution has been carried out. In an effort to better understand the effects of these structural changes on the catalyst, we have determined the changes in the structure of catalysts in-situ and in-operando using Raman spectroscopy, and with other structure-determining techniques before and after the catalytic reactions were carried out. Prior to deposition of manganese oxide, electrodes were prepared by depositing 20 nm of Ti and 200 nm of Au onto a silicon wafer using electron beam evaporation. These were subsequently cleaned by successive sonication in acetone, isopropanol, and distilled water prior to MnOx deposition. Lengths of copper tape were attached to the substrates to act as leads and the electrodes were masked with 3M 470 electroplating tape, with a working area cut out in the center. Manganese oxide films were produced using one of two methods: (1) galvanostatic deposition from a potassium permanganate solution, and (2) potentiostatic deposition from a solution of manganous acetate and sodium sulfate. Their synthesis is briefly described below, and the resulting samples will subsequently be referred to as 1 and 2. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. 1: A 0.9 mM KMnO4 (Fisher Chemical Certified ACS) solution was prepared from solid potassium permanganate and distilled water (18.2 MΩ·cm). A deposition cell was constructed using a platinum wire counterelectrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode. Deposition was carried out galvanostatically by applying a cathodic current of 1.3 mA/cm2 for 1 min. 2: Adapting a literature procedure [7], the deposition solution was prepared by dissolving 3.75 g manganous acetate, 98% Aldrich, and 2.15 g sodium sulfate, Fisher Chemical Certified ACS, in 150 mL distilled water (18.2 MΩ·cm). Depositions were carried out potentiostatically at 0.45 V vs SCE until a charge of 20.85 mC/cm2 had been passed. The resultant films were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy using an FEI XL30 scanning electron microscope (Fig. 1 ), and x-ray diffraction using a Phillips Empyrean diffractometer with a Cu Kα source (SI Fig. 1 ). Films were found to be amorphous. To compare the two amorphous films, activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was measured in KOH solutions prepared by dissolving KOH pellets as required for the desired concentration, (Certified ACS Grade Fisher Chemical), in distilled water (18.2 MΩ·cm) using a Biologic VSP-300 potentiostat. These tests were performed in a high-density polyethylene beaker to minimize contamination from chemical etching of the container, using a standard three-electrode setup with a saturated calomel reference electrode. The two films showed significantly different activities, with 1 reaching an activity of 1 mA/cm2 at an applied potential 385 mV lower than 2 during oxygen evolution (Fig. 2 ). This difference in activity is attributed to differences both in film morphology (SI Section 5) and in film structure as indicated by initial differences in Raman spectra. These results were found to be stable over time, with a small increase in activity observed for 2 (SI Section 3), consistent with reports in the literature [10,11]. Due to an observed tendency for films to delaminate due to agitation from oxygen bubbles at high current density, these measurements were carried out on samples made specifically for this purpose that were not used for in-operando measurements. In-operando measurements were carried out in a teflon cell containing 1 M KOH solution with a platinum wire as counter and pseudo-reference electrode (see Supporting Information). During testing, the applied potential was stepped in 200 mV increments from 0 V vs Pt each held for 5 min. The measurements were repeated at three locations on the film. Raman measurements were initiated three minutes after the system’s potential was set to a new value. Both the 1 and 2 films start as similar amorphous manganese oxides, and show increasing cryptomelane (α-MnO2) character as increasing oxidizing potential is applied (Fig. 3 ), as determined by analysis of in-operando Raman data. Chemometric analysis on the Raman spectra acquired during the progress of the catalysis, was carried out using the PLS toolbox V7.9.5 (Eigenvector Research, Inc., Manson, WA, USA). A classical least squares (CLS) model for fitting was constructed using reference Raman spectra of amorphous manganese oxide, and pure cryptomelane (SI Section 4) as the loadings spectra. All spectra were preprocessed using a 5-point Savistky-Golay smoothing filter followed by normalization by the area under each spectrum. Only the portion of the Raman spectra between wavenumbers of 465–830 cm−1, which represent the main features belonging to the manganese oxides, were used for the CLS analysis (SI Fig. 2 ). Fig. 3 shows the raw Raman spectra and their corresponding cryptomelane scores returned by the CLS analysis. A Linear combination of the scores of the cryptomelane and amorphous manganese oxide and their corresponding loadings spectra (SI Fig. 4) results in the preprocessed raw data. Prior to the application of the oxidizing potential, the cryptomelane score for both films is zero, indicating films are well described by the Raman spectrum of the amorphous MnOx reference. As the oxidizing potential increases the cryptomelane scores increase for both films until a plateau of ∼0.25 is reached at a potential of ∼1.0 V. This change, though not an unequivocal accounting of the presence of cryptomelane, does indicate that both films develop comparable amounts of structural similarity towards cryptomelane under oxidizing potential, whatever contribution cryptomelane may have had to the initial structure. The convergence of both films to a cryptomelane score of 0.25, despite the differences in their activity and preparation, provides unequivocal evidence of structural changes during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution that had been previously suggested but not directly observed [10]. Moreover, we show that as the catalytic reaction progresses the most active MnO2 phase for electrocatalysis in alkaline media increases so that the catalysis becomes more effective for a time before its efficacy declines for other reasons, such as poisoning. A 2012 computational study of the electrochemical water oxidation on manganese oxides found that at the potentials required for water oxidation, manganese oxide films are covered completely with activated oxygen [13] and the potential is well in excess of what is necessary to produce Mn4+ under both neutral and alkaline conditions [13,14]. This seems to be enough to drive the conversion of films towards the cryptomelane (α-MnO2) structure, at least at its surface. This is somewhat different from what has been reported in 2015 for manganese oxide at neutral pH. Using in-operando Raman to characterize Mn3O4 pseudocapacitors Liu et al. claimed that a birnessite (δ-MnO2) phase was produced at high potentials, although without concomitant water oxidation [15]. As that study did not employ quantitative chemometrics to analyze the Raman spectra, it is likely that birnessite is a major component of the spectrum, but unclear if it is the prevailing species as the applied potential increases at neutral pH or what contribution a cryptomelane phase made to the spectra. Given the saturation of both surfaces with oxygen, it seems likely that the actual active process of water oxidation drives this change to more closely resemble cryptomelane at the surface, making manganese oxide not only a good oxidation catalyst, but one that dynamically changes thereby increasing its efficiency towards this function. Finally, these results suggest that even when films are judged to be amorphous by XRD, short range order can significantly affect their electrocatalytic efficacy, and Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting such short-range order. The change of MnOx during water oxidation to its most active phase (a result which is observed for, at least, two different preparations of amorphous MnOx films) suggests that the structural changes occurring on electrode materials during operation deserve attention. While this phenomenon is discussed in the battery literature [16,17], it is less prominent in catalysis, despite significant research into the active phases of catalyst materials. Our work suggests that electrode materials possess the ability to structurally rearrange during the catalytic process leading to concurrent changes in their catalytic properties, at times, as in this instance, improving its electrocatalytic efficiency, at least for a time. Moreover, we believe that the methods presented in this work, combining in-operando Raman spectroscopy with CLS analysis, could present a useful and inexpensive method for tracking relative changes in electrode structure for any electrode material with known chemical composition and well characterized oxides or in sufficiently simple chemical systems.

        "dc:description": "Manganese oxides are promising water oxidation catalysts that have attracted great interest in the fuel cell industry. Previous studies have investigated differences in electrode activity based on the phases of MnO2 involved determining structures and composition ex-situ. Here we compare two preparations of MnO2 films, with differing catalytic activities as prepared, and observe morphological changes as a function of increasingly oxidizing potentials using in-operando Raman spectroscopy. We find that the Raman spectra of the films, both as-deposited and in solution, can be modelled as a binary mixture of amorphous manganese oxide and pure-phase cryptomelane that develop greater cryptomelane (α-MnO2) character as the oxidizing potential increases in 1M KOH. Analyzing the Raman spectra using classical least squares fitting, we determine that both films converge on a cryptomelane score of approximately 0.25; concurrently their catalytic activities improve. These results suggest that significant variations in electrocatalytic activity arise from short range ordering in the catalyst that is not easily determined using ex-situ structure determination.",
