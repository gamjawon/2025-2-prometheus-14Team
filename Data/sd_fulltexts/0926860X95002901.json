While Pt/A1203 shows a linear decrease in activity with time, the bimetallic catalysts are found to be resistant to deactivation. Pt-V/AI203 enhances the selectivity to cyclohexane, whereas Pt- Mo/A1203 and Pt-W/A1203 improve the selectivity for benzene formation. Keywords: Hydrodechlorination; Chlorobenzene; Platinum; Bimetallic catalysts 1. Introduction Catalytic hydrodechlorination is an important process for waste water treat- ment, disposal or recycling of chlorinated hydrocarbons and in the manufacture of fine chemicals [1-3]. Chlorobenzene is often chosen as a model compound in studying the hydrodechlorination reaction since it represents the halogenated species found in many organic wastes. Noble metals are the catalysts of choice for hydrodechlorination reactions carried out both in liquid and gaseous phases. Pd/C [4], Pd/AI203 and Rh/AI203 [5] catalysts have been reported for hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene. Catalyst deactivation due to poisoning by * Corresponding author. Fax. ( + 91-40) 673387.

Srinivas et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) L201-L207 hydrogen chloride produced during the reaction is a normal problem encoun- tered while using monometallic catalysts. Much attention has been focused recently on bimetallic catalysts to achieve longer life (maintaining higher activity) and higher product selectivity compared to that of monometallic catalysts [6]. However, Bodnariuk et al. [7] have reported hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene in the vapour phase over Pd-Rh/A1203 and Pd-Sn/AI203 bimetallic catalysts where a decrease in activity compared to the monometallic catalyst was observed. Ni-Mo/A1203 [3] catalysts possessing better resistance to deactivation have been reported for this reaction but they work at higher temperatures and pressures. In the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene, benzene and cyclohexane are obtained as the main products along with small quantities of chlorocyclohexane. In view of the industrial application it is always desirable to get cyclohexane from chlorobenzene rather than benzene. In this present communication we report the vapour phase hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene over Pt-M/A1203 (M = V, Mo or W) bimetallic systems, which are found to be more stable and selective for the formation of cyclohexane and benzene compared to the monometallic Pt/A1203 catalyst. 2. Experimental The platinum catalyst was prepared by impregnating the alumina support (Harshaw, S.A. 196 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid of the required concentration (Arora-Matthey). The impregnated material was then dried at 110 for 12 h and calcined in air at 400 for 6 h. Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by impregnating Pt/A1203 with an aqueous solution of ammo- nium metavanadate or ammonium heptamolybdate or ammonium metatungstate (all Fluka) depending on the bimetallic system desired. The resulting solids were dried at I10 for 12 h and then calcined in air at 500 for 6 h. For characterization and activity studies one sample of the dried Pt/AI203 catalyst was calcined at 500 for 6 h. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the calcined and reduced (500 for 4 h at a hydrogen flow rate of 60 ml/min) samples were recorded on a Philips PW 1051 diffractometer by using Ni-filtered Cu K c~ radiation. The BET surface area of the prepared catalysts was deter- mined by the nitrogen adsorption method at liquid nitrogen temperature. Catalytic tests were performed in a previously described fixed bed microreac- tor system at atmospheric pressure [8]. About 0.4 g of catalyst was placed in a glass tubular reactor of 6 mm I.D. and pretreated at 500 for 4 h in hydrogen at a flow rate of 60 ml/min and cooled to reaction temperature. A space velocity of 8000 h- l (GHSV) was maintained throughout the reaction study. Chloroben- zene was fed into the reactor using a microprocessor controlled Secura (B. Braun, Germany) syringe pump. The reaction products were condensed in cold SoT. Srinivas et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) L201-L207 203 traps after steady-state conditions were attained (4 h) and were analyzed by GLC using 10% carbowax 20M column and a flame ionization detector. 3. Results and discussion Catalyst composition and BET surface areas of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. It can be noted that the surface area of A1203 has decreased upon impregnation by Pt and the second metal M (V, Mo or W). This observation is expected since, upon impregnation of the active phase, pore blocking takes place. However, the decrease is about 7-15% which indicates that the active phase is well dispersed on the support. This observation is also corroborated by the X-ray diffraction patterns of the calcined and reduced catalysts which have shown no diffraction lines due to crystalline Pt phase or compounds between Pt and M or MOx. In the temperature range (140-200) studied, similar conversion and selec- tivity traces have been obtained in the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene on all the catalysts. The change in conversion of chlorobenzene with time at a reaction temperature of 140 was studied on various catalyst systems. Fig. 1 shows the results of the time on stream studies on mono- and bimetallic catalysts carried out for 16 h under similar reaction conditions. It can be seen that the activity of Pt/AI203 steadily decreased with time, whereas the bimetallic catalysts exhibited stable activity after 4 h on-line with conversions remaining fairly constant throughout the period of study. The initial decrease in activity before attaining the steady state observed on bimetallic catalysts may be attributed to the interaction between metal and HC1 (produced in the reaction) forming a stable surface chloride species [5]. Selectivities for benzene and cyclohexane remained fairly stable on all the catalysts after 4 h. While the selectivity for cyclohexane decreased initially that for benzene increased corre- spondingly. Fig. 1 shows that the bimetallic catalysts are resistant to deactiva- tion compared to the monometallic catalysts.

A typical set of activity and selectivity data, obtained after 4 h on stream, is presented as a bar diagram in Fig. 2. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the chlorobenzene conversion decreased with the addition of M to Pt/A1203 except on Pt-V/A1203. The chlorobenzene conversion obtained on the alumina supported catalysts followed the order Pt = Pt-V > Pt-Mo > Pt-W. It is worth mentioning that the support A1203 and the reduced catalysts V2Os/AI203, MoO3/A1203 and WO3/A1203 have been tested and found to be inactive for the hydrodechlorination reaction under the conditions employed in this study. The decrease in the dechlorination activity with the addition of a second metal M to the noble metal may be a consequence of one or more of the S.T, Srinivas et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) L201-L207 205 100 I--I Conversion r~ Benzene I~ Cyclohexane 80 I I i i 60 lU //., \" N g ~.o .

The first two factors reduce the surface density of Pt metal sites whereas the third may affect the properties of the active species in terms of change in crystallite size and dispersion leading to reduced activity. The amorphous nature of the active species (as revealed by XRD data) and marginal change in the surface area of the support after impregnation suggest that the dilution effect is more prominent in the bimetallic catalyst systems. It can also be observed from Fig. 2 that the selectivity towards cyclohexane is enhanced on Pt-V/A1203 (79%) compared to that on Pt/AI203 (68%). On the other hand, cyclohexane selectivity decreased on Pt-Mo/A1203 and Pt- W/A1203, giving higher selectivity to benzene (60 and 51%, respectively). Formation of chlorocyclohexane is not observed on these catalysts. These contrasting trends in product selectivities may be attributed to the added element which may modify the adsorptive capacities of the reactants and intermediate products on the Pt sites. Electronic interaction between Pt and M are hypothe- sized to reduce the bond strength between the hydrocarbon (or its fragments) and the metal surface with consequent activity and selectivity changes [9]. The higher selectivity to cyclohexane on Pt-V/A1203 may be due to higher reducibility of VOx than MoOx or WOx, in the presence of Pt [10,11]. For the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene, mainly two reaction schemes are prominent. Lapiere et al. [12] have reported a Langmuir type reaction 206 S.T. Srinivas et al./ Applied Catalysis' A: General 135 (1996) L201-L207 mechanism where the reaction between the adsorbed hydrogen and chloroben- zene is the rate determining step. The second, step-wise mechanism, proposed by Coq et al. [5] is similar to that of the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The latter mechanism envisages interaction of chlorobenzene with the metal surface form- ing a metal chloride and regeneration of the metal surface by hydrogen. Both the rates of surface chlorination and reduction are reported to decrease with the decrease in metal particle size. In the present investigation it is assumed that the second metal dilutes the Pt sites leading to smaller particles. Decrease in particle size imparts electron deficient character to the small metal aggregates and thus decreases the activity, as suggested by Coq et al. [5]. Though with the available data, it is not possible to arrive at a conclusion, it may be assumed that the second mechanism is more probable. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, it may be stated that the addition of a metal oxide (MOx, M = V, Mo or W) to Pt improves its stability during the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene. Pt-V/A1203 seems to be a more promising catalyst for obtain- ing cyclohexane selectively in the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene. This study clearly demonstrates that by changing the second metallic element (V, Mo or W), it is possible to change the properties of monometallic Pt sites and achieve the required product selectivity. A detailed investigation to find out the effect of metal (V, Mo or W) loading and its implications on the electronic modification of platinum and its influence on the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene are under way in the authors' laboratory.
