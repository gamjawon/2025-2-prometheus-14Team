The chemistry of methanol conversion over acid zeolftes, and factors influencing catalyst performance in methanol continue to be studied. The stability and activity of non-traditional zeolftes (gallosilicates, aluminophosphates, gallophosphates) are also being investigated. There is an on-going interest in the preparation of highly dispersed metal clusters in microporous supports. Two new areas are studies of metal exchanged zeolites for NOx removal (in collaboration with Dr. Edward Curry-Hyde in the Department of Chemical Engineering), and a collaborative project with BHP's Melbourne Research Laboratory on improved zeolite adsorbents for gas separation, particularly for possible off-shore syngas production. These two groups in the Chemistry Department currently contain two postdoctoral fellows and ten research students. RUSSELL HOWE Catalyst Research at Lower Hutt Industrial Research Ltd. (P.O. Box 31310, Lower Hutt, New Zealand) has a small catalyst research group. Originally work there concentrated on catalysts related tothe gas-to-gasoline process. While testing and some research into ZSM-5 catalysts is still carried out, mainly for commercial clients (Linda Parker), the main effort is currently devoted to the preparation of noble-metal-exchanged zeolites for the removal of volatile hydrocarbons from atmospheres at low temperatures (less than 120). In particular, the work examines the removal of ethylene from fruit storage areas and the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOC's). Involved in applied catalysis A: general this work are Linda Parker and John Patterson. Equipment available includes mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, X-ray, SEM, solid state NMR, FT-IR and a range of thermal analysis techniques. The research group have developed portable mass spectrometers for on-site work. One mass spectrometer can operate for a full day on batteries. Catalyst testing rigs range from micro to pilot scale. On-line mass spectrometry and gas chromatography is automated and usually runs unattended A limited amount of methane coupling work using chlorine-promoted LiMn204 spinels has been carried out with G.R. Burns at Victoria University of Wellington. A C3 selective material may have been found. Work is soon to start on catalysts for preparative organic chemistry. J.E. PATTERSON Methanol Research Plant Proceeds BHP Petroleum has commenced construction of a $70 million Methanol Research Plant at Laverton North, in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This plant will demonstrate new technology for the production of methanol from natural gas, and is scheduled to be in production by the second half of 1994. The commencement of the plant is another step in BHP Petroleum's strategy for the development of uncommitted natural gas resources. BHPP has invested over Aus. $12 million since 1980 in research programs at BHP Research on technology for conversion of natural gas to transportable liquids, and in developing strategies for bringing gas conversion to commercial reality. Most of Australia's natural gas reserves, of which Volume 105 No. 1 - 2 November 1993 BHPP has a large share, are remote from major consuming areas. The conversion of this remote gas to methanol, a liquid which is easily transportable, offers the potential for economic development of gas reserves which would otherwise remain undeveloped. In addition, many of the gas reserves are in locations where a pipeline to shore is not economically or technically viable, and hence offshore gas conversion on a floating production storage and offloading facility, as currently used for oil production on the Jabiru, Challis and Skua fields, is an option being investigated. The methanol research plant will be the first of its kind in the world, and will provide the pilot plant demonstration of new technology developed by ICI Katalco in the United lQngdom. BHPP and ICI Katalco are collaborating to commercialise this technology which has resulted in major improvements to methanol plant design. These include improved energy efficiency over most existing plants, compact design arrangements and a substantial reduction in wastes. The last set of improvements are particularly relevant to potential offshore operation. The methanol production process involves three main steps, the conversion of natural gas to synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide), the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol, and distillation of the crude methanol to produce specification products. The major novel technology in the plant is the gas heated reformer employed in the first step. A mixture of natural gas and steam is fed to the gas heated (primary) reformer and is partially converted to synthesis gas. This partially converted gas is then completely converted to synthesis gas by reaction with oxygen in a secondary reformer. The hot applied catalysis A: general synthesis gas product from the secondary reformer is used to provide the heat for the primary reformer. Hence the term gasheated reformer. Another novel aspect of the new process includes the recycling of byproduct water and impurities from the product distillation back to the gas-heated reformer feed. This essentially eliminates the need for waste water treatment, since only the small quantities of waste water from blowdown streams will need to be treated. BHPP has developed a pilot plant research program to be undertaken on the plant to prove the viability of the new technology, and to determine those factors which control the life of the plant and the catalysts, and the reliability of the plant. This plant research program will be supplemented by related researh projects at BHP Research. The research plant will be about 1/15th the capacity of a world-scale methanol plant, but the product methanol will be used to supply customers in Victoria, replacing imports from overseas. The daily production of about 160 tonnes will be transported by underground pipeline to Victoria's two main methanol users, ICI Australia in Deer Park, and Borden Chemicals in Laverton North. Both ICI and Borden will use the methanol to produce formaldehyde resins, with some on sale to other users. The plant will be located on a 8-hectare site in the Angliss Industrial Estate in Fitzgerald Road, Laverton North. The plant site contains native flora and fauna, and 3 hectares of the site will remain undeveloped, providing a viable tract of native grassland. BHPP is implementing a grasslands management plan, and the landscaping plans have been prepared in consultation with Volume 105 No. 1 - 2 November 1 O N8 the appropriate authorities to ensure that the trees and plants used on the site will retain the native environment as much as possible. Methanol at Seal It is predicted that Australia will experience a decline in oil self-sufficiency, but it has natural gas reserves equivalent to over six times the oil reserves of which gas uncommitted for future use amounts to nearly 80% (I. Rees, BHP Petroleum, Melbourne, paper presented at the National Gas Conversion Symposium). BHP Petroleum has equity interests in about two thirds of Australia's gas reserves. A significant portion of this natural gas is located in off-shore areas. Methanol is one of the products with potential for commercially converting remote gas resources into transportable liquids. BHP Petroleum has decided to implement a strategic programme to demonstrate and develop technology to convert off-shore gas to methanol. BHP's plans are to tap natural gas at sea and to convert ft to methanol at the same site using an ICI technology modified (shrunk) so that the methanol plant can be placed on a floating platform which looks like a normal ship. The methanol thus produced would be stored in the hold of the ship and this would be transferred to land using tankers. As described in the last item, BHP is planning a research plant on the outskirts of Melbourne to demonstrate and develop ICI's Leading Concept Methanol (LCM) technology. The confidence of BHP in the process is reflected in their parallel efforts to de- applied catalysis A: general velop a similar ship-based plant for FT synthesis. K.SESHAN Continuous Solar Power Solar energy should be a valuable resource for countries such as Australia, where there is plenty of sun. However, a major problem is storing that energy and transferring it from areas of supply to those of demand. Anew project of Australia's cSIRO, being undertaken in collaboration with Pacific Power and with funding from Pacific Power, the Energy R&D Corporation and the NSW State Energy R&D Fund, could go some way to solving this problem. The project centres on a chemical reaction which uses concentrated solar energy and a chemical catalyst, such as rhodium, to react together carbon dioxide and methane to form synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). Later, possibly after being transported elsewhere, the synthesis gas can be reformed, releasing energy and leaving the methane and carbon monoxide to be cycled back and re-used. Given a concentrated solar energy input at around 800, it will be possible for the energy output to be of the order of 600. The technical feasibility of the concept is not in doubt. However, to be successful, research is needed to optimise the design of the catalyst and chemical reactor and establish how well it performs under intermittent solar energy. According to Mr. Jim Edwards, who is responsible for the project, it has other exciting possibilities as well. \"The technology should not be seen solely as utilising solar power but as a way Volume 105 No. 1 - 2 November 1993 APCATA 9385143D 0926-860X(93)85143-D 10.1016/0926-860X(93)85143-D Methanol research plant proceeds",
