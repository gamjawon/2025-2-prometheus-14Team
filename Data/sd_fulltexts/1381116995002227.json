The immobilized ion pairs proved to be stable, leach-proof and recyclable. Occasionally the catalytic efficiency dropped upon recycling, owing to pore blockage but the activity could be restored by treatment with boiling water. The performances of the sol-gel-entrapped ion pairs were compared with those of the homogeneous RhCl3/Aliquat 336 catalyst.

C-C bonds, (v) cyclooligomerization and cy- clorearrangement of mono- and dialkynes, and addition of water, carbon monoxide, sulfur and some other active diynophiles to a variety of acetylenes [1]. The used rhodium catalysts in processes (i)-(iii), as well as in the hydration of acetylenes, could be recovered in part (though not entirely) in the aqueous phase as water soluble rhodium salts, by treatment of the reac- tion mixtures with lipophilic salts (NaC104, NaBPh4) [2-5]. In the other processes, how- ever, the ion pairs were transformed during the catalysis to non-recyclable complexes. We have demonstrated recently [6] that these versatile ion pairs can be converted into truly recyclable long lasting catalysts, by their entrapment in SiO2 sol-gel matrices [7].

Blum et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 217-223 ditions under which these matrices can be formed from tetraalkoxysilanes have already proven suitable for encapsulation of various or- ganic, bioorganic and organometallic com- pounds, in ceramic materials [8]. This opens, in fact, the possibility of heterogenizing of many reactions which traditionally have been carded out under homogeneous conditions [3]. In this study we report the encapsulation of RhC13- quaternary ammonium ion pair catalysts, and demonstrate their utility in some isomerization, disproportionation, hydrogenation and hydro- formylation processes. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of the entrapped catalysts Typically, a mixture of 20 mg (8.23 10-3 mmol) RhC13 3H20 and an equimolar amount of the appropriate quaternary ammonium salt in 2.4 ml of triply distilled water was stirred in a cylindrical vial (diameter 2 cm) at 25 for 10 min. Methanol (3.5 ml) was added and the stirring was continued for 30 min. If the solu- tion was not completely homogeneous (as in the case where Aliquat 336served as the quater- nary ammonium salt) the mixture was heated briefly to 60 to ensure complete dissolution. Tetrametoxysilane (2.5 ml) was added (silane:water = 1:8), the stirring was continued for 10 min, and the mixture was left to stand at 25for 3-4 days until gelation was completed. The mixture was heated at 45 until constant weight was achieved. The catalyst was washed with 20 ml of boiling CH~CIz, sonicated for 30 min in the same solvent, dried for 3 h at 1 mm, washed with 20 ml of boiling triply distilled water, and dried at room temperature at 1 mm for 20 h before use. The exact rhodium content of the sol-gel catalyst was determined by sub- straction of the rhodium content in the com- bined washings (analyzed by atomic absorption [9]) from the original amount of metal em- ployed. 2.2. Isomerization of allylbenzene A reaction flask equipped with a reflux con- denser, a magnetic bar and a rubber sealed side arm was charged with the catalyst material and 3 ml of toluene. The vessel was placed in an oil bath thermostated at 90. After temperature equilibration, 270 mg (2.3 mmoles) of allylben- zene was injected into the flask. At intervals of 1-10 min, 2-/zl samples were withdrawn and frozen to await GC analysis on a 2-m long column packed with Carbowax 20 M on Chro- mosorb W, operated at 100). Upon completion of the reaction the liquid was decanted and analyzed for leached rhodium by atomic absorption. The catalyst was washed with 20 ml of boiling CH2C12, sonicated for 30 min, washed again with the same amount of solvent and dried for 3 h at 1 mm. The dried catalyst was used in a second run. If the reactiv- ity of catalyst decreased, the CH2C12 washings were followed by treatment (2 ) with 20 ml of boiling water followed by drying for 20 h at 1 mm. 2.3. Disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene The catalyst and 2 ml of toluene were placed in a reaction flask as above. After temperature equilibration, 2 mmol of 1,3-cyclohexadiene was injected into the flask and samples were with- drawn periodically. Product analysis was carried out on a 3-m long GC column packed with 20% DEGS on Chromosorb W, operated at 30. Catalyst recovery was performed as described above. 2.4. General procedure for hydrogenation ex- periments A catalyst containing 8.2 10-3 mmol of the ion pair, a magnetic bar, 2 mmol of the unsaturated substrate (usually together with a saturated hydrocarbon as internal standard) and 2 ml of CH2C12 were placed in a glass lined mini autoclave. The apparatus was sealed, J. Blum et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 217-223 219 washed (3 ) with hydrogen, and charged with the same gas at the desired pressure. After the required length of time the reaction vessel was cooled, and its content analyzed both by GC and NMR. Metal leaching analysis and catalyst recovery was performed as described above. 2.5. General procedure for hydroformylation experiments In a mini autoclave with stirring and sam- pling devices were introduced a catalyst con- taining 8.2 10-3 mmol of rhodium, 5 mmol of substrate and 2 ml of toluene. The reaction vessel was flushed with hydrogen and CO and refilled with 300-400 psi of each H2 and CO, and heated by an electronically controlled heat- ing mantle at the desired temperature. Samples were withdrawn periodically from the autoclave and analyzed by GC, GC-MS and/or NMR. Leaching analysis and catalyst recycling were performed in the manner described above. 3. Results and discussion Two kinds of rhodium-quaternary ammonium ion pair catalysts have been entrapped in sol-gel matrices: (i) ion pairs with no functional groups that may bind covalently to the silica support, and (ii) ion pairs with a silyloxy group that can copolymerize with the matrix's starting material -- tetramethoxysilane. The encapsulated RhCl3/Aliquat 336 couple (catalyst 1), which is formed by addition of the components of the ion pair to the Si(OMe)4 during the polymeriza- tion process, is an example of the physically encapsulated catalyst (cf. ref. [10]). For the preparation of a catalyst that is chemically bound to the sol-gel backbone [11-13], we copoly- m erized S i(O M e)4 w ith [Me3N(CH2)3Si(OEt)3]C1 (purchased from ABCR, Karlsruhe, Germany), in the presence of RhCI3 3H20 (catalyst 2). Application of catalysts 1 and 2 in some double bond migration, disproportionation, hy- drogenation and hydroformylation processes re- vealed that in spite of the different mode of entrapment, both are practically leach proof, and could be utilized repeatedly in numerous runs. In some cases, however, each of the entrapped ion pairs catalyzed reactions in different rates and sometimes even let to different products. We have already shown [6] that the encapsu- lation of RhC13 in a sol-gel matrix either in the presence or absence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, forms catalysts which are not only recyclable, but promote substantially faster dou- ble bond migration in allylic compounds than non-immobilized RhC13.H20. These catalysts were shown e.g., to convert allylbenzene into an equilibrium mixture with cis and trans-(3-pro- penyl)benzene (Eq. 1) almost twice as fast as the soluble [(CsHIT)3NMe]+[RhC14-nH20]- ion pair (that reacts under phase transfer condi- tions [2]). PhCH 2CH = CH2 ---> cis- and trans-PhCH = CHMe ( 1 ) We have now found that the sol-gel entrapped RhC13/Aliquat 336 catalyst is even more ac- tive, and completes reaction (1) within 2 h (as compared to 4 h by its homogeneous version). However, some dirhodium complexes that have built-in quaternary ammonium moieties, such as [Rh(CO)(Ph 2PCH 2CH 2NMe)( /z-S- CMe3)]2 + [BPh 4 ]2- [ 14] were found to lose their activity as isomerization catalyst, upon encapsu- lation. In contrast to the isomerization reaction that could be carried out also in the absence of an entrapped quaternary ammonium salt, the fol- lowing disproportionation, hydrogenation and hydroformylation processes required the pres- ence of the onium moiety. Disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (Eq. 2) was shown to proceed equally well by 1 2C6H8 ~ C6H1o + C6H6 (2) and 2. Under the conditions given in the Experi- mental section, the respective conversions after 40 min were 97 and 96%. Disproportionation of 220 J. Blum et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 217-223 the diene in a two liquid phase system of toluene and water could be carried out also by the non-immobilized RhC13/Aliquat 336 catalyst, but the rate was slower [4]. Under complete homogeneous conditions in water-free toluene the soluble ion pair proved inactive. Catalyst 1 and 2 could be recycled in numer- ous runs with hardly any loss in activity pro- vided the sol-gel glasses were treated between the runs with boiling CH2C12 followed by soni- cation in order to open blocked pores. Experi- ments conducted with sol-gel-entrapped RhC13 and [Bu4N]C1 instead of RhCl3/Aliquat 336 resulted in slow leaching of the small ammo- nium salt and gradual deterioration of the cata- lyst. Thus, the conversion of 1,3-cyclohexadiene with this catalyst after 90 min were in the first four runs 93, 89, 71 and 30%, respectively. The disproportionation reaction by 1 and 2 could be applied to other dienes as well. The results of these studies will be disclosed in a separate paper. In analogy to the soluble RhCla/Aliquat 336 catalyst, 1 and 2 promote hydrogenation reac- tions as well. The heterogenized catalysts re- quire, however, a somewhat higher pressure of H2, but are substantially more stable and can be fully recycled. Unlike the soluble catalysts that operate under phase transfer conditions, 1 and 2 can be employed in various water-~ee organic solvents. While the homogeneous catalyst has to be stabilized by trioctylamine to avoid precipita- Table 1 Hydrogenation of several unsaturated compounds by the sol-gel entrapped ion pair catalysts 1 and 2 at 50 a Expt.

J. Blum et aL /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 217-223 221 tion of inactive material [15] the sol-gel en- trapped ion pairs do not need any additive to prevent deterioration. The hydrogenation experiments summarized in Table 1 indicate that the relative catalytic activity of 1 and 2 varies from one substrate to another. While e.g., 1 is a much better catalyst for the hydrogenation of styrene than 2, the latter is more active than 1 in the conversion of trans-stilbene into bibenzyl. At 50 and 120 psi H2, terminal and internal olefins, as well as ce,fl-unsaturated ketones are smoothly hydro- genated within a few hours. Under these condi- tions benzene is transferred in quantitative yield to cyclohexane by 1 but not by 2. In the pres- ence of the chemically-bound sol-gel entrapped catalyst, the reduction of benzene at 50 and 120 psi is extremely slow. Only at l l0 the rate becomes appreciable, and 68% of cyclohex- ane is obtained after 15 h. In substrates which have both olefinic and aromatic C-C bonds (e.g., acenaphthylene) only the non-aromatic bond is hydrogenated at 120 psi. In general, the higher arenes require an in- crease in H2 pressure. At 240 psi naphthalene is converted within 18 h by both catalysts into a 1:2 mixture of tetralin and cis-decaline. Slow selective hydrogenation of just one ring takes place by 1 at 140 psi. At this pressure 1-naph- thol is reduced solely at the non-substituted ring to give 5-hydroxytetralin. Catalyst 2 is less se- lective under these conditions, and forms also 1-hydroxytetralin and 1-tetralone (the latter can be regarded as the keto-tautomer of 1-hydroxy- 3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene). At 400 psi, 1 (but not 2) catalyzes partial hydrogenoly- sis of the OH group and promotes the reduction of both aromatic rings to give trans-1-hydroxy- decaline and trans-decalone. Catalyst 2 does not induce hydrogenolysis. It promotes the for- mation of 1-hydroxytetralin as well as 1-de- calone with the cis orientation. Under phase transfer conditions the homoge- neous RhC13/Aliquat 336 ion pair causes hy- drogenolysis of both aromatic and aliphatic halogen atoms [1]. At 120 psi H2 the sol-gel entrapped catalysts neither affected aromatic halogen atoms (chlorobenzene, bromonaph- thalenes) nor side chain bromides, except that of benzyl bromide which yielded toluene. (3- Bromopropyl)benzene was neither hydrogenated by 1 nor by 2 at 120 psi H2. At 500 psi the chemically-bound catalyst 2 (but not 1) pro- moted slow reduction of the aromatic ring with- out affecting the bromine. Nitrobenzene was hydrogenated at 120 psi by both catalysts.

Blum et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 217-223 ever, while 1 formed soly aniline, 2 yielded also aminocyclohexane. It should be recalled that under phase transfer conditions the homoge- neous ion pair forms in addition to aniline also nitrocyclohexane [16]. Benzonitrile that is not hydrogenated under homogeneous conditions could be transformed to benzylamine at 400 psi and 80-100. When the drying of catalyst 2 from the water washings was incomplete, the nitrile was reduced (at 200 psi and 80) to PhCH = NH which readily underwent hydrolysis to PhCHO. Although the soluble RhC13/Aliquat 336 ion pair was shown to catalyze the carbonylation of several diynes [1,17], it proved unsuitable as a hydroformylation catalyst. The sol-gel encapsu- lated version 1, as well as catalyst 2 have now been found applicable to such processes. Some representative results are summarized in Table 2. As in the hydrogenation reactions, the cata- lysts vary in their activity: sometimes 1 has the higher activity and sometimes vice versa. At 100-135, 300 psi H2 and 300 psi CO, cy- clopentene and cyclohexene form in toluene the corresponding cyclic carboxaldehydes. Catalyst 1 is preferred in these reactions. Linear alkenes such as 1-decene have been shown to undergo double bond migration as a side reaction and consequently mixtures of aldehydes are formed. The products obtained from 1-decene were in addition to Me(CH 2)9CHO and M e(CH 2)TCH(CHO)M e also M e(CH 2)6CH(CHO)Et and Me(CH2)sCH(CHO)Pr. Styrene gave a mixture of the expected linear and branched aldehydes. The ratio b:l could be increased by lowering the temperature, albeit at tion rate. Substitution led, in the 1-catalyzed the expense of the reac- of the toluene by benzene reaction, to an increase of the b:l ratio from 2.2 to 3.4, but decreased the ratio in the 2-catalyzed process from 2.2 to 1.5. The benzene enhanced, however, the rate so that quantitative conversion of styrene by 1 was obtained in less than 2 h. 1-Methylstyrene reacted very slowly (espe- cially in the presence of 1) and gave, owing to the steric effect, exclusively the linear aldehyde. Hydroformylation of allyl phenyl ether by 2 yielded, in addition to the linear aldehyde, PhO(CH2)3CHO also phenol and 1- and 2- butanal. The amount of the latter product which was only 1% in the first run increased in con- secutive runs on account of the main reaction product. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the po- tential utility of sol-gel catalyst encapsulation methodology in a variety of organic reactions. While covalent entrapment is a fairly known process [13], we could show that the simpler direct physical caging is at least as efficient and useful for heterogenizing of metal-onium ion- pair catalysts.

The ion pairs RhCl3/Aliquat 336® and RhCl3/[Me3N(CH2)3Si(OMe)3]Cl were entrapped in SiO2 sol-gel matrices, and used as catalysts for isomerization of allybenzene, disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, arenes, nitriles and nitro-compounds, and for hydroformylation of CC double bonds. The immobilized ion pairs proved to be stable, leach-proof and recyclable. Occasionally the catalytic efficiency dropped upon recycling, owing to pore blockage but the activity could be restored by treatment with boiling water. The performances of the sol-gel-entrapped ion pairs were compared with those of the homogeneous RhCl3/Aliquat 336 catalyst. In most cases the immobilized catalysts proved superior to their homogeneous version. Keywords Immobilized catalysts Hydroformylation Hydrogenation Rhodium Sol-gel References [1] J. Blum Russ. Chem.
