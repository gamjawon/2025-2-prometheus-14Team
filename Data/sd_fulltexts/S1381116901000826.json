Steric and electronic effects of the R in IndTiCl2(OR) catalysts on the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene Haiyan Ma Bin Chen Jiling Huang Yanlong Qian * The Laboratory of Organometallic Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, PR China * Corresponding author. Fax: +86-21-64702573 Four alkoxyl ligand substituted indenyl titanium dichloride complexes, IndTiCl2(OR) (R=Me (2), Et (3), i Pr (4), cyclohexyl (5)) were prepared, and evaluated as catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene when activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes showed higher catalytic activities than IndTiCl3 (1) except for complex 5. When R=Et, the catalyst 3 showed the highest activity. A study of the steric and electronic effects of alkoxyl ligand revealed that the more electron-donating and less steric bulky R group was more suitable for the improvement of the catalytic activity. When the polymerization was carried in solution at high molar ratio of Al/Ti=4000, the s-PS% of obtained polymer were in the range of 99.0–99.6%. The highest melting point of 276.9°C was obtained by using 2 as catalyst. The influence of polymerization temperature was also investigated. The maximum polymerization activities were found at 50°C for all of the above complexes, but the percentages of s-PS were insensitive to the polymerization temperature. Keywords Syndiotactic polystyrene Titanocene Alkoxyl ligand Steric and electronic effects 1 Introduction Ishihara and co-workers’ work [1,2] led to a further search for the new types of s-PS catalysts. In 1993, Ready et al. reported the first s-PS catalyst containing indenyl ligand and found that the (η5-indenyl)TiCl3/MAO system catalyzed the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene over a wide range of polymerization temperature more effectively than CpTiCl3/MAO system [3–6]. More efforts were devoted to the syntheses of new kinds of half-sandwich titanocenes and the elucidation of the relationship of precursor structure and its catalytic behavior [7–12]. It was found that the electron-donating ability of the π-donor ligands (such as cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, etc.), steric effects and chirality of the ligands attached to the group 4 metal centers strongly influenced the polymerization. The effects of the substituents attached to the cyclopentadienyl or indenyl ligand of (η5-Cp)Ti(O i Pr )3 and (η5-Ind)TiCl3 on the styrene polymerization have been discussed [4–16]. But the effect of the σ-bonded ligands has not been reported properly. Our previous work proved that one alkoxyl group substituted complexes of general formula CpTiCl2(OR) were more active than CpTiCl3 [17–20]. When R= i Pr and cyclohexyl, the catalytic activities were as high as 6.33–6.58×107 gPS/(molTimolSh) and were three times as that of CpTiCl3 [19]. Were there similar influences on the catalytic activity when a chloride atom was substituted by an alkoxyl group in IndTiCl3? In this work, we prepared four single-alkoxyl-ligand substituted indenyl titanium dichloride complexes of general formula IndTiCl2(OR) (R=Me (2), Et (3), i Pr (4), cyclohexyl (5)), and compared their catalytic behavior with IndTiCl3 in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All operations were carried out under an argon atmosphere using the standard Schlenk techniques. Tetrahydrofuran, toluene, hexane were distilled from sodium/benzophenone ketyl under argon prior to use. Methylene chloride was distilled under argon from phosphoric anhydride. Methanol and ethanol were refluxed with sodium under argon then were distilled. Isopropanol, cyclohexanol were refluxed with CaH2 under argon, then were distilled under reduced pressure. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) was produced by Witco GmbH. Styrene was purified by distillation under reduced pressure twice, and stored at −20°C in darkness prior to use. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian GERMINI-300 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet MAGNA-IR 500 spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained at 70eV using a HP 5989A mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an EA-1106 spectrometer. X-ray structure was determined by a Rigaku AFC7R diffractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å) and a 12W rotating anode generator. 2.2 Preparation of IndTiCl3 (1) IndTiCl3 was synthesized according to the literature method [3]. Indene was treated with n-BuLi to give indene lithium. The indene lithium reacted with Me3SiCl to obtain 1-SiMe3Ind in 73%. 1-SiMe3Ind was added dropwise to the solution of TiCl4 in CH2Cl2, then the solvent was removed to give a dark red solid. After recrystallization, dark red crystals were separated. 1 H NMR (δ, ppm): 7.81 (m, 2H), 7.55 (m, 2H), 7.19 (d, 2H, J=12Hz), 7.16 (t, 1H, J=12Hz). 2.3 Preparation of IndTiCl2(OMe) (2) The complex was synthesized according to a modified literature method [21]. A solution of n-BuLi (3.75mmol) in 10ml n-hexane was treated with dry methanol (0.1200g, 3.75mmol) in 1.7ml n-hexane and 1ml THF at room temperature.

The total volume was 12ml. The bottle was put into an oil bath for a certain time. The polymerization mixture was quenched with 10% HCl in ethanol, filtered, washed and dried in vacuum oven at 80°C for 24h to a constant weight. The polymer was then extracted with 2-butanone for 2h to remove any atactic polymer. The s-PS% was determined as the amount of polymer insoluble in 2-butanone. Melting points of the obtained syndiotactic polystyrene were determined by DSC. The thermograms were recorded with a DSC 2910 Modulated DSC Universal V1.10B TA Instruments. 3 Results and discussions When the indenyl trichloro complex IndTiCl3 was treated with the lithium salt of the corresponding alcohol, catalysts 2–5 were obtained in moderate yield as dark red to orange crystals. Crystallization of catalyst 5 from CH2Cl2/n-hexane at −20°C afforded crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The molecular structure, selected bond distances and angles for 5 were given in Fig. 1 . It was composed by two separated molecules with different intramolecular dimension slightly. The crystal structure showed clearly a piano-stool configuration with the indenyl penta-hapto bonded to the tetravalent titanium center with a ring centriod bond distance of 2.059–2.065Å, which was little longer than the one in IndTiCl3 [3]. The alkoxyl group was coordinated as a pronounced π-donor, as evidenced by the short titanium oxygen length of 1.715(2)–1.718(2) Å and the obtuse angle at the oxygen of 159.0(3). The same interaction of oxygen to tianium was also found in the similar complex 2 [21]. Thus, we thought this kind of interaction in alkoxyl substituted complexes might have significant influence on the catalytic behavior. Table 1 summarized the influence of alkoxyl ligands on the polymerization of styrene in solution. Generally, the catalytic activity and the s-PS% increased with the increasing of Al/Ti from 2000 to 4000, which was in agreement with those reported by Ishihara [2]. The s-PS% at high molar ratio of Al/Ti=4000 were very high as more than 99%. As shown in Table 1, the substitution of alkoxyl ligands did have some influence on the catalytic activities of the complexes. Alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes showed higher catalytic activities than IndTiCl3 except for complex 5. Complex 3 showed the highest activity among the five complexes. We thought the substitution of alkoxyl ligands introduced some electronic effects compared to IndTiCl3. The strong π-donation of oxygen to titanium center decreased both the bonding of titanium indenyl and titanium chlorine, which could be deduced from the longer lengths in complex 5 than in IndTiCl3 [3]. The weakening of TiCl bonding might make easier the methylation and ligands abstraction that were thought to lead to the formation of the active species [22]. From this point of view, the introducing of the alkoxyl ligand might increase the formation rate of the active species and also the concentration of it, thus, might lead to the increase of the catalytic activity. Since the complex 5 still showed lower activity than IndTiCl3, we thought the substitution of alkoxyl ligand also introduced some steric effects. The alkoxyl ligand that was considered to have been stripped during the formation of the active species might still surround the active species. When R was cyclohexyl, a bulky group, the coordination and insertion of styrene to the titanium center might be hindered due to the surrounding of the bulk alkoxyl group, reflected in the decrease of the activity. Certainly, the substitutions of the other three alkoxyl ligands also introduced some steric effects. Compared to the electron-donating ability, the steric effects were rather weak, thus, complexs 2 and 3 showed higher catalytic activities than IndTiCl3, and complex 3 showed highest activity. When R was isopropyl, there existed the steric and electronic effects either of them would be the dominant factor due to the different polymerization conditions. Under the given conditions in Table 1, the electronic effect became the dominant factor, thus, the activity increased. When we carried the polymerization in bulk with a low molar ratio of Al/Ti=300 (Table 2 ), the steric hindrance became a further dominant factor due to the high monomer concentration, as a result, complexes 4 and 5 showed lower catalytic activities than IndTiCl3. Complex 3 still showed the highest activity (run 15, 16). The percentages of syndiotactic polystyrene were not as high as those in Table 1. High styrene concentration increased both the syndiospecific polymerization rate and the aspecific polymerization rate [23,24]. The catalytic activities were higher than those in Table 1 (Al/Ti=2000–4000). As shown in Table 2, the activities of complexes 1, 2 and 3 increased twice with the decrease of [Ti] from 0.42 to 0.21mmol/l at a constant Al/Ti (run 11 with 12 and so on). It was suggested that the polymerization rates were almost same for [Ti]=0.21–0.42mmol/l due to the very high styrene concentration. As to complexes 4 and 5, because of the steric hindrance, the activities did not increase so much as those of complexes 1, 2 and 3 (run 17, 18 and so on). We also investigated the influence of temperature on the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in bulk. From the results in Table 3 , we found the maximum polymerization activities were obtained at 50°C. Higher temperature (90°C) led to the decrease of the activities. The percentages of s-PS obtained by alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes were affected slightly by the polymerization temperature. Furthermore, unlike the cyclopentadienyl analogues [19,20], the indenyl complexes 2–5 exhibited high syndiospecificities even at low polymerization temperature of 25°C. 4 Conclusions The results of this study indicated that alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes showed higher catalytic activities than IndTiCl3 (1) except for complex 5, and the more electron-donating and less steric bulky R group was more suitable for the improvement of the catalytic activity. When the polymerization was carried in solution at high molar ratio of Al/Ti=2000–4000, the s-PS% of obtained polymer were in the range of 95.8–99.6%. The highest melting point of 276.9°C was obtained by using 2 as catalyst. The maximum polymerization activities were found at 50°C for all of the complexes. The percentages of s-PS obtained by the alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes were insensitive to the polymerization temperature.
