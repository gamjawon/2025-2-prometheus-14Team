Tel.: +86-351-4049612; fax: +86-351-4041153. When iron was introduced in CuMnZrO2 catalyst, it was found that the adsorption features of catalysts changed significantly. The presence of iron improved the copper dispersion, which resulted in the total adsorption of CO increase, and intensified the reaction between CO and catalyst surface. Moreover, the CO bridge-adsorbed on iron sites was detected. Bicarbonate species formed on the CuMnZrO2 catalyst when CO adsorption took place at 573K, while formate species were favored and predominant on the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst. The adsorption of CO on the precipitated Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts for mixture alcohols synthesis were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption and FTIR spectra recorded at adsorption temperature in the range 298–673K, in order to detect any synergy in the adsorption of CO on CuMnZrO2 as a result of iron addition. In the case of CuMnZrO2 catalyst, only one kind of CO adsorbed or desorbed, which was ascribed to weakly adsorbed CO species on copper sites, was detected in FTIR and TPD study. Moreover, for CuMnZrO2 catalyst the formation of bidentate carbonate species was favored at 298K, and bicarbonate species formed at higher temperature. When iron was introduced in CuMnZrO2 catalyst, it was found that the adsorption features of catalysts changed significantly. The presence of iron improved the copper dispersion, which resulted in increasing of the total adsorption of CO, and intensified the reaction between CO and catalyst surface. Several kinds of CO adsorbed or desorbed were detected on Fe-CuMnZrO2. The formation of bicarbonate species took place at 298K, and formate species was detected at higher temperature, suggesting that the presence of iron greatly influenced the process of methanol synthesis. Keywords Cu/ZrO2 catalyst Higher alcohols synthesis Iron effect CO adsorption DRIFT TPD 1 Introduction Higher alcohols synthesis from coal or natural gas via syngas due to its potential application as a good gasoline blend or alternative motor fuel for the reduction of exhaust emission has resulted in significant research. As a result, several catalytic systems for higher alcohol synthesis through CO hydrogenation were developed [1,2]. Copper-containing catalysts, such as Cu/ZnO, Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/SiO2, have been intensely studied because of their activity in the CO and CO2 hydrogenation. In the last few decades, many papers have centered on the characterization of Cu/ZrO2-based catalysts because it showed a good activity for methanol synthesis [3,4]. The controversy concerning the nature of the surface intermediate, which was pivotal to the formation of methanol, was well known. Indeed, for many authors the formate species was the precursor of methanol [5–9], whereas others [10–12] considered that formate was not the precursor of methanol and that it was rather the bidentate carbonate which was hydrogenated to the methoxy species. It was possible that the nature of the pivotal species depended on the nature of the support. However, the conclusions were admitted for most researchers: zirconia provided adsorption sites for the reactive intermediates, and the formation of intermediate species could be varied by doping different promoters. In our previous work, it was found that certain proportion for higher alcohols was obtained over iron, cobalt and nickel modified Cu/ZrO2-based methanol synthesis catalysts [13–15]. Furthermore, the presence of iron in CuMnZrO2 catalyst greatly enhanced the formation of higher alcohols, which were a mixture of straight chain alcohols and branched alcohols (mainly isobutanol). Under the reaction conditions of 573K, 8.0MPa and 8000h−1, the alcohols space-time-yield was up to 0.424gml−1 h−1, but the methanol content in the alcohols product was relatively high. Increase of C2 + alcohols is desirable from the practical point of view. The effect of iron on the structural and physical properties of the copper species in the catalysts was discussed in our earlier reports [16,17]. It was found that a stronger interaction between copper and iron took place, which was favorable for chain growth to produce higher alcohols. In the present work, the interaction of CO with CuMnZrO2 or Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts were investigated by temperature-programmed desorption and in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR in order to provide an insight into the effect of iron on the nature of adsorbed species on the surface. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts CuMnZrO2 catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation of a solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Mn(NO3)2, and ZrOCl2·8H2O with an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 at 343K and a constant pH of 10 in a well-stirred thermo-stated container. Then the precipitates were aged at 343K for 2h. After washed thoroughly with distilled water, the precipitates were dried at 393K for 12h, and then calcined at 623K in air for 3h. Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts were prepared using the same procedures as for CuMnZrO2, except that Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was introduced into the mixed solutions. The composition of the prepared catalysts was as follows: Cu:Mn:Zr:Fe = 1:0.5:2:0.1 (molar ratio). 2.2 Characterization of catalysts The BET surface areas of catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption at 77K using the Tristar 3000 Chemical Adsorption Instrument (Micromeritics). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max diffractorments with a Cu target and Ni filter. The Cu surface area (S Cu) was determined by applying a N2O pulse method as described by Evans et al. [18]. A catalyst sample was placed in a quartz tube reactor and reduced in flowing H2 (99.99%). After reduction, the gas flow was switched to Ar (99.99%) and the temperature was lowered to 353K. A pulse of N2O (99.995%) was introduced into the argon flow by means of a calibrated sample valve. The exit gas was analyzed by mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 200). The amount of surface Cu was calculated from the amount of nitrogen evolved, assuming the dissociation of N2O takes place on surface Cu followed the equation (average atom density: 1.49×1019 atoms/m2): (1) N 2 O(g)+2Cu s =N 2(g)+(CuOCu) s X-ray adsorption spectra (XAFS) around the Cu K-adsorption edge were obtained using the deamline of 4W1B of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The storage ring was operated at 2.2GeV with a typical current of 50mA. The fixed-exit Si(111) flat double crystals were used as monochromator. The EXAFS data were processed with the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory analysis programs (NSRLXAFS). A total of 4.0 nearest oxygen was found for each copper site at an average distance of 0.195nm on the bulk CuO and these results were in good agreement with the conclusion of crystal analysis, which indicated that the fixed error in our experimentation and data analysis was very low. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out on a flow apparatus and the isothermal adsorption of CO was used prior TPD. The sample (200mg) was reduced in a quartz micro reactor according to the following pre-treatment: H2 (573K, 6h) → Ar (573K, 0.5h) → Ar (298K). Afterwards, isothermal adsorption of CO was performed at temperatures between 298 and 573K by injecting the CO/Ar (5vol.% CO) mixture gas until the catalyst surface was saturated. After cooling to room temperature in CO/Ar mixture gas, the weakly adsorbed CO species was swept with pure Ar. The total amount of CO adsorption could be calculated from the adsorption curve and remove curve. Subsequently, the TPD experiments were carried out. The temperature of the system was raised linearly (10Ks−1 in general in present work) under an Ar gas flow. The analysis of the effluent gases was performed with a mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 200). MS signals at m/z=28 (CO), and 44 (CO2) were continuously recorded. All spectra recorded from desorption were referenced to those of corresponding blank samples. The CO peaks were corrected for fragmentation of CO2 (CO2→CO+O) in the spectrometer. The diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectra were recorded using Nicolet Magna-II 550 FTIR spectrometer equipped with Spectra-Tech Diffuse Reflectance Accessory and a high temperature in situ cell with ZnSe windows. A KBr beam splitter has been used with a TGS detector. One set of stainless steel gas lines was built and connected to the cell. This allowed in situ measurements for adsorption in a flow of gas. The catalyst was reduced according to the following pre-treatment: H2 (573K, 6h) → Ar (573K, 0.5h) → Ar (298K). After that, the catalyst was exposed to CO (99.999%) for 1h at 298K and purged with Ar to remove gaseous CO, and the IR spectra were recorded. Then, the temperature of system was increased to other desired value (between 298 and 673K) in Ar. After adsorbed CO at this temperature, the catalyst was cooled down in CO to room temperature, swept with Ar and collected the IR spectra. Subsequently, the above-mentioned experiments procedure was applied again. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural and structural properties of Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts The surface area measurements for catalysts were listed in Table 1 . CuMnZrO2 catalyst showed large surface area with the average pore size of 3.3nm. The addition of iron could slightly increase the surface area and enlarge the pore size. Similar to CuMnZrO2, Fe-modified catalysts hardly showed the obvious XRD patterns, suggesting that the components were highly dispersed and the zirconia were amorphous. However, measured by N2O titration, the Cu surface area and dispersion increased obviously due to the addition of iron (see Table 1). Likewise results from the EXAFS experiments were presented in Table 2 . Compared to CuMnZrO2 catalyst, the coordination number of Fe-CuMnZrO2 decreased and the distance of Cu–O slightly enhanced. This revealed that the Cu species existed in much smaller crystallites and exhibited an amorphous-like or less well-ordered structure feature. In this case, the very high Debye–Waller factors associated with this shell also indicated the presence of great disorder. Therefore, these results demonstrated that the iron both as a support promoter influenced the texture of catalyst and as an additive enhanced the dispersion of Cu. 3.2 Isothermal adsorption of CO The isothermal adsorption of CO was measured at different temperatures (see Fig. 1 ), and then the total amount of CO adsorption was listed in Table 3 . When the CO adsorption on CuMnZrO2 catalyst was carried out at 298K, the total 498μmolg−1 of CO were adsorbed and no other gases were evolved during this adsorption. The similar phenomenon was observed on the isothermal adsorption of CO at 373K except that there was a delay in the appearance of CO, which indicated that the uptake of CO increased. Furthermore, CO2 was detected for the isothermal adsorption of CO at 473K when the adsorption of CO was saturated. It suggested that the CO dissociation or the disproportionation reaction took place on the catalyst surface at present condition. As the temperature reached to 573K, the adsorption of CO need a long time to get saturated and CO2 was evolved during the isothermal contact CO, suggesting that the reaction of CO with the catalyst was intensified due to the rise of adsorption temperature. The spectra of the isothermal adsorption of CO on the Fe modified catalyst were similar to that on CuMnZrO2 catalyst besides the CO uptake obviously increased (see Fig. 2 ). Moreover, the amount of desorbed CO2 increased obviously at higher adsorption temperature compared with CuMnZrO2. This indicated that iron could increase the adsorption of CO over catalyst and improve the reaction between CO and catalyst surface. 3.3 CO temperature-programmed desorption Fig. 3 gave the spectra of CO-TPD after isothermal adsorption on CuMnZrO2 catalysts at different temperatures. When the CO adsorption on CuMnZrO2 catalyst was carried out at 298K, CO2 was the major product with the desorption peak at 506K and a hump at 651K (see Fig. 3A), while only a small amount of CO was evolved at 343K. With the CO adsorption at 373K, the large amount of CO2 was released and appeared four peaks at 352, 414, 490 and 654K, respectively, while the desorption of CO shifted to 336K (see Fig. 3B). When the adsorption temperature further increased to 473 and 573K, the amount of desorbed CO2 increased regularly (see Fig. 3C and D). In principle, as the adsorption temperature increased the amount of desorbed CO reached a maximum at 473K and then decreased, while the CO2 increased monotonous. Fig. 4 gave the spectra of CO-TPD on Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts after isothermal adsorption at different temperatures. Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst showed two CO desorption peaks appeared at 343 and 402K, corresponding to the adsorption of CO on copper sites and modified iron sites, respectively. Moreover, it was noteworthy that the peak of CO desorbed from iron sites increased continually and shifted to high temperature simultaneously with the rise of adsorption temperature. Over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, Robinson and Mol [19] observed that CO desorbed in temperature range of 313–623K with two distinct peaks. The peak at low temperature was ascribed to the weakly adsorbed CO species on copper sites and another peak was ascribed to the strongly adsorbed CO species on copper sites. However, we only observed one peak at 336–343K and detected several peaks of desorbed CO2 in higher temperature range. The difference might be related to the conversion of strongly adsorbed CO on catalyst to some species at higher desorption temperature, which decomposed and released the large amount of CO2 at the corresponding temperature. The amounts of adsorbed CO and that of desorbed CO and CO2 during the experiments were listed in Table 3 in detail. It could be seen that the total uptake of CO and desorption of CO2 increased with the rise of adsorption temperature both on CuMnZrO2 and Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst. However, the amount of CO desorbed from copper sites showed a maximum at 473K, while the CO desorbed from iron sites increased continually. It was noteworthy that the remaining carbon (COads − COdes − CO2des) on catalyst surface coming from disproportionation reaction or the dissociation desorption of CO increased with the rise of adsorption temperature and iron obviously enhanced the reaction. For instance, the remaining carbon was 151μmolg−1 (498 − 36 − 311) for CuMnZrO2 catalyst at 298K, and was 380μmolg−1 (1364 − 30 − 921 − 33) at 573K. Correspondingly, for the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts it was 195μmolg−1 (525 − 35 − 7 − 288) at 298K and 537μmolg−1 (1432 − 51 − 167 − 570 − 107) at 573K. It clearly indicated that the presence of iron improved the disproportionation reaction or the dissociation desorption of CO on catalyst. Apparently, the CO2 desorption was suppressed at the presence of iron during TPD process. In general, CO2 could result from the disproportionation reaction (2CO→CO2+C), the dissociation desorption of CO, the decomposition of carbonaceous species or the interaction of CO with lattice oxygen [20]. Disproportionation reaction or the dissociation desorption of CO could take place at low temperature, as revealed by the spectra recorded from the isothermal adsorption. However, the desorbed CO2 from the decomposition of carbonaceous species or the interaction of CO with lattice oxygen was favored at high temperature [21]. When CO adsorption was carried out at 298K we were only able to detect the desorbed CO2 in the temperature range 500–700K on CuMnZrO2 catalyst corresponding to decomposition of carbonaceous species. With the rise of adsorption temperature the peak at low temperature was observed and the intensity of the peak at high temperature also increased, which indicated the reaction between CO and catalysts was aggravated. However, iron could enhance the reaction between CO and the surface, as revealed by the TPD results of Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts that had a more intense peak at low temperature contrasted to CuMnZrO2 [22–24]. But the total amounts of CO2 desorption was less than that on CuMnZrO2 sample at corresponding conditions. It suggested that the presence of iron greatly influenced the formation of intermediate species on the catalyst surface. 3.4 Infrared spectra of CO adsorption When CO adsorption on CuMnZrO2 catalysts occurred at 298K Only a single IR band at 2109cm−1 was observed, corresponding to CO linearly adsorbed on copper species [25]. At higher temperature the peak for CO linearly adsorbed on copper decreased monotonically (see Fig. 5A ). Compared with the spectra of CO adsorbed on CuMnZrO2, more adsorption species could be discriminated over Fe-CuMnZrO2. When CO adsorption occurred at 298K, one peak at 2113cm−1 was observed, also for linear CO species on copper sites (see Fig. 5B). It was noteworthy that the intensity of the band decreased with the rise of adsorption temperature and showed a minimum at 473K then increased. In addition, two new bands at 1932 and 1946cm−1 appeared after CO adsorption at 423 and 473K, respectively. They reached a maximum at 573K. Based on the results above, one important issue should be clarified, that was, the CO adsorption properties of the copper were influenced consumingly by the addition of iron. In the infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on the CuMnZrO2 catalyst, only one band at 2109cm−1 was observed that corresponded to CO linearly adsorbed on copper sites. The band shifted to high frequency at 2113cm−1 when iron was introduced into CuMnZrO2 catalyst. This suggested that the interaction between copper and iron resulted in decrease of the antibonding of the copper d-electrons to the 2π*-orbital of the CO molecule, thus the carbon–copper bond in the chemisorbed CO molecule on copper sites was weakened, which led to the band of CO adsorbed shift to high frequency. Moreover, the intensity of the linear CO species on copper sites kept reducing on the CuMnZrO2 catalyst with the increase of adsorption temperature because of the reconstruction and/or the poisoning (carbon deposition coming from the CO dissociation or disproportionation) of metal particles in the course of the CO adsorption [26]. While, for the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst, it showed a minimum at 473K, suggesting that the presence of iron enhanced the intensity of the linear CO species on copper sites and influenced the process of carbon deposition. On the other hand, two new broad bands at 1932 and 1946cm−1 appeared at 423 and 473K on the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst, respectively, and would reached maximum at 573K. Compared with the spectra results of CuMnZrO2 catalyst, we could draw a conclusion that the two bands were correspondent to the CO bridge-adsorbed on iron sites [27], which was in agreement with the findings of the CO-TPD study. Huang and Anderson [28] reported that the reduction of hematite first to magnetite and then to iron followed the reactions: (2) αFe 2 O 3 → 523–573 K+H 2−H 2 O Fe 3 O 4 → 673 K+H 2−H 2 O αFe Thus, the iron could not be reduced completely under the present condition at pretreated process. But the CO played an important role in the activation of iron. Indeed, it was found that the intensity of CO bridge-adsorbed on iron sites increased with the CO adsorption temperature. This indicated that the surface adsorption sites of iron were enhanced by CO. Usually the bridged-form CO was considered to be more active than the linear CO and favored to chain growth [29,30]. Therefore, the high activity of Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst for higher alcohols synthesis seemed to be associated with the formation of bridge-type CO, which was easily dissociated to oxygen and carbon. The IR bands between 1000 and 1700cm−1 have been assigned to carbonaceous species on catalysts. It has been previously reported that on Cu/ZrO2 catalysts system. Baiker and co-workers [10,12,31] have reported that for both CO and CO2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO2 for methanol synthesis, the CO adsorbed on the catalysts to form carbonate species, which then underwent hydrogenation to produce bidentate carbonate (b-CO3 2−) or bicarbonate (b-HOCOOs −) or formate species (b-HCOOs −), then methoxy species (CH3Os), and finally methanol formation. The formation of intermediate species could be varied by doping different promoters, such as Zn, La, Cr and Mn. In the present case, for CO adsorbed on CuMnZrO2 at 298K, features attributed to b-CO3 2− (1643 and 1292cm−1) [21], and CH3Os (1061, 2823 and 2932cm−1) [32] are prevalent (see Fig. 6A ). The presence of CH3Os may be the result of the carbonaceous reacting with the hydrogen remaining on the catalyst surface after reduction, even though the catalyst was purged at 573K for 30min in Ar to removed adsorbed hydrogen. As adsorption temperature increased to 573K the band for b-CO3 2− decreased in intensity, while the predominant species present were b-HOCOOs − (1608 and 1308cm−1) on the CuMnZrO2 sample, at which temperature the CuMnZrO2 catalyst had a top activity for methanol synthesis as reported in our previous papers [13,14], suggesting that b-HOCOOs − was probably the precursor of methanol for CuMnZrO2. In contrast, for the iron promoted CuMnZrO2 catalyst (see Fig. 6B), when CO adsorption occurred at 298K the predominant features were bands at 1612 and 1342cm−1, which could be attributed to b-HOCOOs −. At higher temperature, significant bidentate formate (b-HCOOs −) formation became evident giving characteristic maxima at 1365, 1596, 2874 and 2975cm−1 and the intensity of the bands went through a maximum at 573K (see Fig. 6C). At about 373K the features observable at 1060, 2823 and 2932cm−1 was assigned to CH3Os and showed a maximum at 573K. These results indicated that b-HCOOs − was probably the precursor of methanol for Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst. Therefore, the presence of iron influenced the formation of carbonaceous species and the process of the hydrogenation of carbonaceous species on the catalysts surface. This result was consistent with the TPD results, which demonstrated that the CO2 from decomposition of carbonaceous species was varied in the presence of iron. 4 Conclusion The interaction of CO with CuMnZrO2 or Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalysts were investigated by temperature-programmed desorption and in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR coupled with probe adsorption. It was found that the adsorption features of catalysts changed significantly with the addition of iron. On the one hand, the presence of iron improved the copper dispersion, which resulted in the total adsorption of CO increase, and intensified the reaction between CO and catalyst surface. Moreover, the CO adsorbed on iron sites was detected in FTIR and TPD study, and was considered to be more active than CO adsorbed on copper and favored to chain growth in hydrogenation. In addition, the CO played an important role in the activation of iron. On the other hand, the presence of iron influenced the formation of carbonaceous species and changed the process of the hydrogenation of carbonaceous species on the catalysts surface. Bidentate carbonate species formed on the CuMnZrO2 sample when CO adsorption took place at 298K and bicarbonate species at 573K, while bicarbonate and formate species formed on the Fe-CuMnZrO2 catalyst at same conditions, respectively. Thus, the presence of iron greatly influenced the process of methanol synthesis. The effect of iron will be reflected by the C2 +OH formation and by-production formation in higher alcohols synthesis.
