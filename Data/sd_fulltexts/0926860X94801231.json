Box 1, 1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands 'University of Utrecht, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Sorbonnelaan 16, 3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands (Received 24 August 1993, revised manuscript received 26 November 1993 ) Abstract The performance of supported nickel catalysts in the disproportionation of n-propylamine was studied. Although hydrogen is not needed as a reactant, it is observed that in the absence of hydrogen the activity of the catalysts is low. Furthermore, deactivation of the catalysts by carbon deposition and nitride formation occurred when hydrogen was not present. In the presence of hydrogen, deactivation by carbide formation was suppressed. At high hydrogen concentrations deactivation of the catalysts was completely inhibited. During the reaction in the presence of hydrogen, all catalysts formed dipropylamine'with a high selectivity (more than 98 mol-%). Without hydrogen, however, unsaturated molecules were the main products (imines, Schiff bases). This observation was explained by a bifunctional mechanism; propylamine is first dehydrogenated on the metal to the imine, which is converted subsequently to the Schiff base on the acid sites of the support. In the absence of hydrogen these compounds are not hydrogenated and leave the catalyst bed. It was demonstrated that the activity of a particular catalyst in the disproportionation reaction is related to its acidity. The existence of a linear relationship between the conversion of propylamine and the selectivity toward ethylamine in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile proved that the acidity of a catalyst is responsible for the occurrence of the condensation reactions leading to secondary and tertiary amines. The disproportionation of n-propylamine is a new and highly reliable catalytic test reaction to measure the acidity of supported nickel catalysts.

Verhaak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 263-275 a major problem. It has been demonstrated that acidic sites on the catalyst support promote the extent to which these reactions take place [1,2]. The use of a basic support and, preferentially, the application of additives to supports commonly used in catalysis (yalumina and aluminosilicate) to reduce their intrinsic acidity are procedures that have been adapted successfully to enhance the selectivity toward primary amines. If a catalyst is highly selective toward primary amines, the condensation and deamination reactions leading to the higher substituted di- and trialkylamines are apparently suppressed. The catalysts, as used in the hydrogenation of nitriles [ 1,2], were therefore tested also with respect to their performance in the condensation of a primary amine, i.e. the disproportionation of npropylamine. At first sight the reaction seems to be relatively simple; the reaction of two propylamine molecules yields dipropylamine and ammonia, as shown in the overall reaction 1: 2CH3CH2CHZNHz - (CH3CHZCH2)ZNH+NH3 (1) In subsequent sections, however, it will be shown that the underlying mechanism is a great deal more complex than it appears from the overall reaction equation above. Although hydrogen is not involved in the overall reaction, it will be demonstrated that the hydrogen content of the feed is an important parameter that determines both the selectivity of the process and the activity and the stability of the catalyst. The measurements described are aimed at the establishment of the influence of the composition of supported nickel catalysts and their acid-base properties in particular on their behaviour in the disproportionation of n-propylamine. A set of catalysts ranging from highly acidic nickel-on-aluminophosphate and nickel-on-aluminosilicate to only slightly acidic nickel-on-potassium-promoted y-alumina and nickel-on-magnesia was studied in the above disproportionation reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of the catalysts The supports and the supported nickel catalysts were prepared as described previously [ 3 ] . In short, precursors of the silica-supported nickel catalysts were prepared either by the decomposition of urea at 90 in a nickel containing aqueous suspension of silica or by wet impregnation of a silica support (fumed silica, Aerosil 200 from Degussa AG, surface area about 200 m2/g) with an aqueous nickel nitrate solution. A series of K-modified y-alumina samples was prepared by wet impregnation of powdered y-alumina (Aluminumoxide-C from Degussa AG, surface area about 100 m2/g) with solutions containing various concentrations of KN0, Promoted alumina supports containing either sodium, calcium, or zinc were prepared in a similar way. The samples were dried at 120 and calcined for 5 h at 550. A series of supported nickel catalysts was obtained from the promoted aluminas by wet impregnation of the support with a solution of nickel nitrate. The unpromoted nickel catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of several calcined, alumina-based supports with an aqueous nickel nitrate solution. This way nickel was applied onto y-a.lumina, aluminosilicate (Engelhard De Meern, product code A797- M.J.F.M. Verhaak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 263-275 265 06-002-01, surface area about 225 M2/ g) and aluminophosphate (surface area about 125 m 2/g, [31). Magnesia-supported nickel catalysts were prepared through the precipitation of a nickel magnesium mixed oxalate using the injection of ammonium oxalate into a solution containing both nickel and magnesium nitrate at 50. The molar amount of ammonium oxalate injected was equal to the molar amounts of nickel and magnesium together. Unpromoted catalysts are encoded by appending the nickel weight loading to the first character of the support (S for silica, A for alumina, M for magnesia, AS for aluminosilicate, and AP for aluminophosphate). Promoted catalysts are encoded by adding the atomic symbol of the promoting element to the code of the corresponding unpromoted catalyst. The nickel loading was adjusted to 5 wt.-% in all catalysts (based on a complete reduction), except for the catalysts encoded S25U (U for urea decomposition) and M25 that were loaded with 25 wt.-% of nickel [ 3 ] . Samples of catalyst S25U were diluted with silica to obtain formally a 5 wt.-% Ni-loaded catalyst in reduced form. To that end the dried precursor was powdered in a mortar and diluted with Aerosil 200 in the ratio precursor-tosilica of 1 /4. The code of this catalyst is S25U-d. Catalyst M25 was diluted with magnesia (Merck, p.a.) to obtain formally a 5 wt.-% Ni-loaded catalyst after reduction. The encoding of this catalyst is M25-d. The catalyst precursors were air-dried at 120 overnight and subsequently powdered. The powdered (diluted) precursors were pressed at 1000 kg/cm2, crushed, and finally sieved. The sieve fraction 0.50-0.85 mm was used in all kinetic experiments. 2.2. Gas-phase disproportionation of n-propylamine The gas-phase disproportionation of propylamine to dipropyl- and tripropylamines was studied in a fully automated micro-flow apparatus, operating at atmospheric pressure, as described in refs. [ 1,2] . Prior to the catalytic experiments, the precursors were dried in situ at 125 for 30 min in flowing hydrogen. Following the drying step, the reactor temperature was raised to 450 at a rate of 2/min and kept at 450 for 10 h. It was shown earlier that this reduction procedure results in high degrees of reduction (80-100%) and welldispersed catalysts (60-120 m2/g Ni) [ 3 ] . After reduction, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in flowing hydrogen. Then the gas composition was switched to a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen. The gas composition could be varied between 100 vol.-% hydrogen and 100 vol.-% nitrogen. The gas mixture was subsequently saturated with n-propylamine (Merck, p.a.) by bubbling the gas stream through a saturator held at - 15 by means of a cooled circulator (Tamson TLC-3), resulting in a concentration of 5.6 vol.-% n-propylamine in the gas stream [4]. The gas mixture was passed downflow through the fixed catalyst bed that initially consisted of 0.25 g of dried catalyst precursor (i.e. before reduction). The catalyst was mounted in a Pyre' reactor with an internal diameter of 10 mm. The temperature was measured just below the catalyst bed with a chromel-alumel thermocouple. In the Arrhenius-type experiments the reactor temperature was first raised from room temperature to 75 (where the catalytic activity of most catalysts developed) and then, at this temperature, the catalyst bed was stabilized for 25 min. Following the stabilization, the bed temperature was raised in steps of 5 to 175 with a 20 min stabilization time between 266 M.J.FM. Verhaak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 263-275 two measurements. The same procedure was followed with decreasing bed temperatures. The Arrhenius measurements were always performed in pure hydrogen saturated with 5.6 vol.-% n-propylamine. It appeared that the selectivity of the process as well as the activity and stability of the catalyst were influenced by the hydrogen concentration. To obtain information on the influence of the hydrogen concentration on these parameters, also several isothermal experiments were performed. In the isothermal measurements the reactor temperature was first raised from room temperature to 150 at a rate of 10/min. When this temperature was attained, the catalytic performance was followed as a function of process time in various hydrogen concentrations. Data points were collected every 20 min. A typical run consisted of a gas-chromatographic (GC) analysis of a product sample (propylamineo) and of a reference sample, wiithdrawn from the reactant gas entering the reactor (propylamine,). The conversion is defined as: propylamine Conversion (%) = 1 ` . 100% propylamineeProduct selectivities have been calculated from peak areas corrected for different response factors in the flame ionization detector and normalized to moles of product. Since the carbon balance was always near 100%, the selectivity for product i is defined as: Selectivity' (mol-%) _ Corrected area` ~ 100% Summed area of all peaks In Table 1 the general test conditions adapted in the kinetic measurements are summarized. Prior to the catalytic experiments it was verified that the bare, nickel-free supports were inactive in the disproportionation reaction. In the temperature range 20-200 none of the supports was reactive. No experiments were performed above 200. Preliminary experiments ruled out the existence of transport limitations.

The sieve fractions 0.212-0.50 mm and 0.50-0.85 mm produced identical conversion patterns indicating the absence of intra-particle transport limitations. Variation of the bed depth and gas flow-rate at constant space velocity also resulted in similar conversion patterns, and thus inter-particle heat and mass transfer limitations were absent too. 2.3. Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) To identify the nature of adsorbed species during the disproportionation of propylamine a TPSR experiment was conducted. Prior to the experiment 0.15 g of the diluted nickel-onsilica precursor, S25L1-d, was reduced analogous to the procedure described above. The reduced catalyst was cooled in hydrogen to room temperature, and a mixture containing 63 vol.-% N2, 31.4 vol.-%o H2, and 5.6 vol.-% propylamine was fed to the reactor. The temperature of the catalyst bed was increased from room temperature to 150 at a rate of 10/min, and the disproportionation proceeded at this temperature for 10 h. Next, the catalyst was cooled to 100, the propylamine and hydrogen feed were shut off and the reactor was flushed with nitrogen for 30 min. The catalyst was subsequently cooled to room temperature in flowing nitrogen. A mixture of 10 vol.-% HZ in argon was then directed through the catalyst bed and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 400 at a linear rate of 3/min. A thermal conductivity detector monitored the change in hydrogen concentration continuously. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Disproportionation of n-propylamine: Influence of the hydrogen partial pressure The silica-supported nickel catalyst S25U-d was used to study the influence of the hydrogen partial pressure on the activity, selectivity, and stability in the disproportionation of n-propylamine. Only one sample of the catalyst was employed and between two measurements the nickel phase was \"cleaned\" by treatment with pure hydrogen at 250 for 2 h [ 6 ] . Fig. 1 shows the conversion of n-propylamine at 150 as a function of time measured at several hydrogen partial pressures, ranging from 0 to 0.9 bar. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that a lower hydrogen concentration resulted in increasingly higher initial and final levels of activity. However, when the hydrogen concentration was reduced to zero, the conversion of propylamine showed a severe drop. The removal of all hydrogen from the feed resulted in a great loss of activity as well as an increased rate of deactivation. While only in pure hydrogen the extent of deactivation was not significant (as can be seen from the minor tilt of the curve), the extent of deactivation increased significantly at lower hydrogen concentrations. The observation that the extent of deactivation is reduced by the application of a sufficiently high hydrogen partial pressure agrees with the results presented in other work [ 6 ] . From the data presented in Fig. 1 it may be concluded that the rate equation for disproportionation of n-propylamine has a negative order in hydrogen, i.e. the reaction rate increases with decreasing hydrogen partial pressures. However, the pres- 268 M.J.FM.

Numbers between lines denote the hydrogen concentration. ence of (some) hydrogen is needed to maintain activity, because in pure nitrogen both a comparatively low catalytic activity and a fast rate of deactivation resulted. At first sight it seems quite unexpected that the disproportionation reaction is sensitive to changes in the hydrogen concentration. In the overall reaction equation for propylamine disproportionation (see reaction 1) hydrogen is not involved. The reason for this apparently unusual behaviour will be given with the aid of the following experiments. The conversion of n-propylamine was followed isothermally at 150 in pure hydrogen for several hours just like the previous measurement. In this experiment, however, the propylamine-saturated hydrogen feed was replaced by propylamine-saturated nitrogen after approximately 10 h of operation. Then, after another 10 h, the nitrogen stream was again replaced by hydrogen. In between the gas switches the catalyst was not cleaned in hydrogen. Fig. 2 shows the conversion pattern resulting from this experimental sequence. The left-hand part of Fig. 2 displays the conversion of n-propylamine in a hydrogencontaining gas stream. It is obvious that the catalyst exhibited a stable conversion level of about 40%. The switch to nitrogen resulted in a severe drop of the conversion, as was observed in the previous figure. When the carrier gas was switched back to hydrogen, a steady conversion level was again attained, as shown in the right-hand part of Fig. 2. It seems, however, that the catalyst had lost some of its activity, since the conversion level shifted to the slightly lower value of 37%. Studying the catalytic amination of long-chain aliphatic alcohols over copper catalysts, Baiker and Richarz [7,8 ] , and Baiker [ 9] observed a drop in the conversion of 1-dodecanol when hydrogen in the feed was replaced by nitrogen. Similar to our results, the catalytic activity was recovered when the gas stream was switched back to hydrogen. They ascribed their findings to the formation of copper nitride during the measurement in nitrogen. The formation of copper nitride resulted in lower conversions. Based on the results on the stability of nickel nitride in hydrogen [ 3 ] , we assume that the presence of hydrogen brought about a smooth transformation of copper nitride into metallic copper with the concomitant rise in activity. In the amination of 1-dodecanol with dimethylamine [8], the dispropor- M.J.F.M.

The ammonia liberated in this reaction was held responsible for the formation of copper nitride. Although nitride formation occurs on exposure of either nickel or copper to ammonia at elevated temperatures in the absence of hydrogen, it will be demonstrated that nitride formation is not solely responsible for the drop in catalytic activity with nickel-based catalysts. To that end TPSR was used, as described extensively elsewhere [ 6,10,11 ] . After catalyst S25i1-d had been operated in the disproportionation of propylamine at 150 for 10 h, the sample was cooled to 100 in the propylamine containing nitrogenhydrogen mixture, purged at this temperature for 30 min with pure nitrogen, and cooled to room temperature in flowing nitrogen. Next, the temperature was raised to 400 in 10 vol.-% HZ/Ar while the hydrogen consumption was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector. The resulting hydrogen consumption profile is plotted in Fig. 3. The hydrogen consumption profile in Fig. 3 is dominated by a hydrogen consumption peak at 185 with a shoulder on the low-temperature side (152). Based on previous results, the position of the peak at 185 was assigned to the hydrogenation of surface nickel carbide ( a-carbon ) [ (i,l0-13 ] . It can be concluded that during the disproportion ation of n-propylamine also carbon deposition occurred, :in accordance with the results obtained with the hydrogenation of acetonitrile [ 6] . Because nickel nitride is not formed in the presence of hydrogen, it can be concluded that the observed loss of activity with time-on-stream in the presence of hydrogen (see Fig. 1) was caused exclusively by carbon deposition. During the measurements in nitrogen both nickel nitride as well as extensive nickel carbide formation took place. This explains why the catalytic activity did not regain its initial value after switching back to hydrogen. The nickel carbide formed in nitrogen could not be removed completely in hydrogen, since the measurement was performed at 150, which is too low a temperature to regenerate a nickel catalyst deactivated by carbon deposition [ 6] . Nickel nitride, on the other hand, is hydrogenated completely to nickel and ammonia at this temperature [ 3 ] . 270 M.J.F.M.

The plot displays the hydrogen consumption (measured with a hot wire detector) as a function of the catalyst temperature. The selectivity of catalyst S25U-d as a function of time measured during the experiments represented in Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 4. This figure clearly shows that the drop in activity after the hydrogen in the feed had been replaced by nitrogen was accompanied by a severely decreased selectivity toward dipropylamine (DPA). In hydrogen, a high selectivity toward DPA was observed ( more than 98 mol-%), whereas in nitrogen the DPA-selectivity dropped to the rather low value of about 10 mol-%. When hydrogen was again substituted for nitrogen, the DPA-selectivity recovered. Besides DPA, two other compounds were formed in the hydrogen-lacking environment.

Reaction sequence in the acid-catalyzed condensation of propylantine. Schiff base 1), the half-hydrogenated state of propionitrile, and propylidene propylamine (SCB-2, Schiff base 2), the precursor state of DPA formed by the condensation of propylidene imine and propylamine and loss of ammonia, were observed. It can thus be concluded that if hydrogen is absent during the disproportionation, unsaturated molecules are formed. The bifunctional mechanism presented in other work, used to describe the reactions involved in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile [ 1,2] , can fully account for these observations. The mechanism demonstrates that the disproportionation of amines does not take place by a mere bimolecular collision between two (adsorbed) amine molecules. The experimental fact that the bare supports were completely inactive in the deamination indicates that a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function has to be present for the reaction to proceed. The reactions involved in the disproportionation of amines are accomplished in the following way. The incoming amine molecules are partly dehydrogenated on the metal surface with the formation of an aldimine. The aldimines desorb from the metal and migrate through the catalyst bed. Protonation of the aldimine on the surface of the support and subsequent condensation with amines coming from the gas phase will produce the Schiff base upon loss of ammonia and deprotonation. Desorption of this unsaturated compound from the support and its transport to the metal surface will result in hydrogenation to the secondary amine. Hydrogenation will, of course, only occur in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere. The absence of hydrogen will result in the evolution of unsaturated compounds as shown in Fig. 4. To illustrate the mechanism, Fig. 5 shows the reaction sequence in the disproportionation of n-propylamine. The observation that the extent of disproportionation decreased with increasing hydrogen concentration in the feed (see Fig. 1) illustrates the negative effect of hydrogen on the overall rate of the reaction. The reaction sequence shows that hydrogen will inhibit the dehydrogenation of the amine to the imine and, therefore, lowers the overall reaction rate. The addition of ammonia to the reaction mixture to suppress the (undesired) condensation reactions in the production process of primary amines is often mentioned [ 14,15 ] . The reactions show that the action of ammonia lies in the shift of the equilibrium of the third reaction step in the reaction sequence to the left-hand side. Ammonia therefore diminishes the extent to which the deamination reactions occur. 3.2. Uisproportionation of n-propylamine: Infuence of the support In the previous section it was shown that during the disproportionation of n-propylamine the presence of hydrogen was essential to hydrogenate the intermediate Schiff base formed 272 MJFM. Verhaak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 263-275 on the support. Furthermore, it was necessary to use large amounts of hydrogen in the feed to suppress the extent of deactivation caused by carbon deposition. To minimize carbon build-up on the catalyst during the process, all following experiments were performed in hydrogen saturated with 5.6 vol.-% propylamine. To study the catalysts with respect to their behaviour in the deamination of propylamine several Arrhenius measurements were performed on the reduced catalysts in the temperature range of 75-175. Fig. 6 shows the Arrhenius plots of several catalysts as indicated in the legend of the figure. The data points in Fig. 6 were all fitted to first order polynomials and the resulting straight lines all run in parallel within the experimental error. This indicates that the kinetics of the reaction are the same for all catalysts. The only difference between the various catalysts is the value of the pre-exponential factor. In Table 2 the parameters derived from the Arrhenius plots, the data on the acidity of the catalysts (from ammonia desorption, taken from ref. [3] ), and their selectivities in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile (taken from refs. [ 1,2] ) are summarized. Fig. 6 and Table 2 learn that the acidic catalysts all have large intercepts and that with decreasing acidity the intercepts decrease also. For a particular catalyst, the intercept obtained from the Arrhenius fit is thus a measure for its acidity. However, since the intercepts are obtained only after a long, unreliable extrapolation to infinitely high temperatures, the error in the value will be considerable. It was decided to use the conversion of n-propylamine, measured in hydrogen at 125, to quantify the acidity of the catalysts. In Fig. 7 the relation between the acidity of the catalysts, as measured by the desorption of ammonia in the temperature range of 20 to 150 [ 3 ] , as a function of the acidity as measured by the conversion of propylamine at 125 in hydrogen is shown. It is obvious that with a decreasing acidity of the catalyst, as measured by the desorption of ammonia, the conversion of propylamine decreased also. Whereas the acidic catalysts AP5 and AS5 both converted more than 35% of propylamine at 125, the conversion of propylamine over the basic catalysts AS5K-10 (containing 10 wt.-% K), A5Na, A5K-2 (containing 2 wt.-% K), A5K-3 (containing 3 wt.-% K), and M25-d was negligible ( < 12%). 4 AP5 AS5 0 S25U-d o 3 A ' A5 J O 0 A5Ca A5K-2 2 A5K-3 1 0 0 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.6 1000/7 (1/K) Fig. 6.

[3] ), for various supported nickel catalysts. The relation between the acidity of a catalyst and its activity in the disproportionation of propylamine is not surprising since it was shown that the reaction is acid-catalyzed. We can conclude that the activity in the conversion of (propyl)amine(s) is another tool to measure the acidity of supported nickel catalysts. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that the selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile was related directly to the acidity of the catalyst, as measured by the desorption of ammonia [ 1-3 ] . A relation between the acidity of the catalyst, as measured by its conversion of n-propylamine at 125, and its selectivity toward the primary amine is therefore expected also. In Fig. 8 this relation is shown. 274 M.J.F.M.

Relation between catalyst acidity, as measured by the rate of disproportionation of n-propylamine at 125, and the selectivity toward ethylamine in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile at 125 (data from refs.

It can be concluded that the disproportionation of n-propylamine is a new and highly appropriate method to measure the acidity of supported nickel catalysts. 4. Conclusions The conversion of propylamine into dipropylamine was studied over a large number of supported catalysts. By measuring the rate of this reaction at various hydrogen concentrations, it was demonstrated that the reaction exhibits a negative order in hydrogen; at higher hydrogen concentrations the conversion of propylamine decreased. In the absence of hydrogen, however, the conversion of propylamine showed a severe drop. It was concluded that, although the rate was influenced negatively by hydrogen, its presence was necessary to maintain catalytic activity and stability. In the absence of hydrogen, namely, the rate of deactivation of the nickel catalysts was much higher than in the presence of (some) hydrogen. Using TPSR it was shown that during operation the formation of surface nickel carbide occurred. The application of high concentrations of hydrogen could suppress the extent of carbon accumulation on the catalyst. In the presence of hydrogen all catalysts were highly selective in the formation of dipropylamine during the disproportionation of n-propylamine. However, when hydrogen was removed from the feed, the selectivities changed significantly. Instead of DPA, mainly unsaturated molecules, aldimines and Schiff bases, were formed. These observations could be explained with the aid of a bifunctional mechanism and yielded further proof for the existence of this mechanism. The extent of conversion of propylamine was related to the acidity of the catalyst. The existence of a linear relationship between the conversion of propylamine and the acidity of a particular catalyst, as measured by the desorption of ammonia, proved the acid-catalyzed M.J.F.M. Verhaak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 263-275 275 nature of the reaction. Therefore, the high primary amine selectivity observed in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile with basic nickel catalysts is due to the suppression of the acid-catalyzed deamination of the product. The disproportionation of n-propylamine was used to measure the acidity of a catalyst. The method was applied successfully with a large number of nickel catalysts and can be regarded as a new catalytic test reaction for the determination of the acidity of a catalyst. Using this method for the measurement of catalyst acidity, it was shown again that the selectivity toward eth;ylamine in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile was determined by the acidity of the catalyst.

Although hydrogen is not needed as a reactant, it is observed that in the absence of hydrogen the activity of the catalysts is low. Furthermore, deactivation of the catalysts by carbon deposition and nitride formation occurred when hydrogen was not present. In the presence of hydrogen, deactivation by carbide formation was suppressed. At high hydrogen concentrations deactivation of the catalysts was completely inhibited. During the reaction in the presence of hydrogen, all catalysts formed dipropylamine with a high selectivity (more than 98 mol-%). Without hydrogen, however, unsaturated molecules were the main products (imines, Schiff bases). This observation was explained by a bifunctional mechanism; propylamine is first dehydrogenated on the metal to the imine, which is converted subsequently to the Schiff base on the acid sites of the support. In the absence of hydrogen these compounds are not hydrogenated and leave the catalyst bed. It was demonstrated that the activity of a particular catalyst in the disproportionation reaction is related to its acidity. The existence of a linear relationship between the conversion of propylamine and the selectivity toward ethylamine in the hydrogenation of acetonitrile proved that the acidity of a catalyst is responsible for the occurrence of the condensation reactions leading to secondary and tertiary amines. The disproportionation of n-propylamine is a new and highly reliable catalytic test reaction to measure the acidity of supported nickel catalysts.
