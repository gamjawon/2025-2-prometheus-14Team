Niezapominajek 1, 30-239 Krakow, Poland Received 16 March 1995; revised 27 July 1995; accepted 1 August 1995 Abstract The mechanism by which the introduction of some elements modifies principal properties of the V-P-O system in oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been studied. The incorporation of Li, Na, K, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Ba at different concentrations which can easily donate electrons to the framework of vanadyl phosphate with P/V ratio = 1.07 and 1.20, leads to an increase of the effective negative charge on oxygen atom and of the rate of butane oxidation. The presence of additives causes an increase of the surface P/V ratio and corresponding changes of acidic properties of the catalysts. Selectivity towards maleic anhydride passes through a maximum when plotted as a function of the amount of acidic centres at the surface. The preparation of a catalyst characterised by high activity in butane oxidation and high selectivity to maleic anhydride requires a fine tuning of the basicity of surface oxygen atoms to accelerate the activation of butane and of the acidity of the surface to secure the appropriate residence time of the reaction intermediates. Keywords: Butane oxidation; Maleic anhydride; Phosphorus oxide; Vanadium phosphate I. Introduction Oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is of significant worldwide commer- cial interest. Complex vanadium-phosphorus oxide systems containing additions of different elements (promoters) are extensively used as catalysts in this process. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Zazhigalov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 225-237 However, elucidation of the mechanism by which the introduction of these elements modifies principal properties of the V-P-O system requires further investigations. The majority of data concerning promoted V-P-O catalysts are contained in patents [ 1-4]. However, little information is available on the character of changes in properties of the V-P-O system generated by introduction of the additives. For example, different sequences of additives to catalysts in order of decreasing yield of maleic anhydride have been published: Cr > Fe > Hf > Zr > Ce > La > Mn = Zn > Ru > Mo > Sn =Ti= Sb > V-P-O=Th= Pr> W > Sm = Ag > Nb > Ni > U > Co[5];orZn > Cu > Bi > Li > V-P-O > Mn > Sn > Cr > Fe [6];orZn > Co = V-P-O > Cd > Mn > AI > Fe = La > Mg[7];orCo > Sn > U > La > Mo > V-P-O > Bi > Cu > Li > Ca > Cd [8]. Thus, even authors, who use the same method for catalyst preparation, express conflicting views on the influence in n-butane oxidation of the same element, e.g. Cr or Fe which either improve the catalytic properties [5] or worsen them [6]. Similarly, different results were published as to the role of cobalt: it worsens the properties of basic composition [ 5 ], exerts a positive influence [ 8 ], or does not affect the properties of V-P-O catalyst [ 7 ]. In the literature of the subject, Zn and Co are most often mentioned as promoting additives to V-P-O catalyst [9-17 ]. Apparently, Zn can improve the properties of the basic matrix [ I 1,12,17]; however the method of its introduction is of a great importance [ 12,17 ]. Results of the most detailed investigation of the influence of many additives on physical and chemical properties of promoted samples are given in [ 14,15]. They bring information on the influence ofLi, Ba, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd, Cd, Sn, Ce, and their concentration on the resulting properties of V-P-O catalysts prepared by two methods. By X-ray analysis it was found that all catalysts, except those containing Pd and Ba, were composed of (VO)2P207-phase. The yield of maleic anhydride, depending on the type of addition, followed the order: Sn > Co > Mn > Fe > Cu > Li > Cd > Ce > Zn > Ni > V-P-O > Ba > Pd. All additions listed before vanadyl pyrophosphate improve the properties of V- P-O phase. This conclusion essentially disagrees with the patent data mentioned above and some results obtained later [ 17-20]. Data from our laboratory show that the type of phase, in the form of which the addition is present in the V-P-O catalyst, determines its influence on the catalytic properties. Metal additions can be present in the V-P-O catalyst in four types of phases: (i) metallic, (ii) metal oxide, (iii) metal phosphate and (iv) bi-metal phosphate. For each type, its characteristic influence on catalytic properties of the V-P-O system was observed. As an example, recently published results on Zn- addition [17] have confirmed the influence of the type of phase in which Zn is present, on the catalytic properties of V-P-Zn-O. It is well known that in the case of alkaline-earth metal additions, formation of hi-metal phosphates, such as MeVOP207 and MeVOPO4, may take place [ 21-27 ]. V.A. Zazhigalov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 225-237 227 According to these data metal ions are distributed in empty channels of pyrophos- phate or ortophosphate networks. Early investigation of the properties of V-P-O catalysts containing alkali and alkaline-earth elements in the form of bi-metals phosphates, i.e. K2VOP207, Na2VOP207, Cs2VOP207, MgVOP207, LiVOPO4, NaVOPO4, KVOPO4 have shown [ 28 ] that their activity is higher as compared to V-P-O samples but their selectivity to maleic anhydride falls to zero. Later, we have studied the effect of the addition of the same elements in small (Me/V <0.1) concentrations on the properties of V-P-O (P/V = 1 ) catalyst [ 18,29] and found their beneficial influ- ence. The influence of alkali and alkaline-earth elements on the properties of V-P- O catalysts was also studied [ 19,20,30-32]. In this paper we report the changes in the properties of two V-P-O compositions with P/V ratio = 1.07 and 1.20, caused by introduction of Li, Na, K, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Ba at different concentrations. 2. Experimental Catalysts were obtained by the known procedure [ 16,29] starting from V205 and H3PO4 (87%) in n-butyl alcohol as a solvent. Additives in the form of chlorides were introduced simultaneously with vanadium oxide. The initial bulk composition of products is given in Table 1. After precipitation, filtration and drying, the catalyst powder was wetted and extruded as pellets with a 4.8-mm diameter and 5-mm length. Chemical analysis of vanadium and phosphorus content was performed in a similar way as by Zazhigalov et al. [ 16]. Concentrations of additions were deter- mined with the help of an atomic-absorption spectrometer 'Saturn-1'. Catalytic tests were carded out in a flow reactor with chromatographic analysis of all products [29] at the flow rate changing from 1500 to 6000 h- 1. The catalytic properties were compared for stationary characteristics obtained after not less than 48 h. Examination of catalysts for their stable operation was carried out in an element of the industrial unit (I.D. 25 mm, length of the catalyst bed 2.9 m) during 2000 h. The phase composition of catalysts before and after their work in the reactor has been determined by X-ray diffraction using a diffractometer DRON-3M [ 16]. The compositions of the sub-surface layer and the in-depth profile in the pellets were obtained by means of scanning electron microscopy (Jeol: JSM-35 SF and JSM-35C) using X-ray microanalyze Ortek EEDS-II and 35-DDS (XMPA) fol- lowing the procedure described by Zazhigalov et al. [ 16 ]. The analysis of the surface composition was carried out by XPS on VG Scientific ESCA-3 and ES-100 'Kratos' spectrometers [ 16]. Acidity-basicity was determined by thermo-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 as test molecules. Oxygen mobility on the catalyst surface was measured by 228 V.A.

It may be seen that the content of the additions in the bulk is in all cases almost the same as the calculated concentration. Introduction of the additions does not change the specific surface area, the observed scatter around the mean value of 29 m2/g being due to the experimental error of _ 3 m2/g, as compared to the basic V-P-O catalyst. Similar distribution of additives was obtained in the case of catalysts synthesised using V-P-Me-O precursor with P/V ratio = 1.20 (Table 1 ) with the mean surface area amounting to 26 ___ 2 m2/g.

Positions and intensities of X-ray reflexes were not affected by the presence of additives. After work in the catalytic process, all samples without any exception, contained the (VO) 2P207 phase. The analysis of the content of additions in the sub-surface layer of catalysts after catalytic experiments (shorter than 80 h) by means of XMPA and on the surface by XPS were in good agreement with the results of chemical analysis representing their bulk concentrations (see Table 2). Similarity of Me/V ratio in the bulk and on the surface can be taken as an evidence of uniform distribution of the addition in the catalyst. However, comparison of the data of chemical analysis, XMPA and XPS, indicates that the P/V ratio shows the highest value at the surface, a little lower value in the subsurface layers, both being much higher than the bulk value. This indicates that an enrichment in phosphorus takes place, its concentration decreasing on moving into the bulk. XPS spectra reveal also a tendency of the 230 V.A.

For the catalysts' composition see Tables 1 and 2. surface concentration of oxygen to increase when additions of the alkali and alka- line-earth metals were introduced to the V-P-O catalyst (Table 2). It should be noted that introduction of the additions and variation of their content in the V-P-O catalysts did not cause any changes of the binding energy values of P 2p- and V 2p3/2-electrons, while the binding energy of O 1 s-electrons was reduced both in catalyst with P/V = 1.07 and that with P/V = 1.20. The decrease of binding energy of O 1 s-electrons may be taken as the evidence of the increase of effective negative charge on oxygen atoms, corresponding to the increase of the basicity of the surface. This effect should result in significant adsorption of CO2 which does not take place on the unpromoted catalysts. Indeed, the amount of adsorbed carbon dioxide increased in good correlation with the decrease of the binding energy of O 1 s-electrons (Fig. 1 ). It should be noted that the values of the binding energy of electrons in the introduced alkali and alkaline-earth metal cations are higher than those reported for their other simple compounds [ 33 ]. For example, for V-P-Me--O catalysts the binding energies are shifted to higher values for: V.A. Zazhigalov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 225-237 231 Na ls, by 1.5-2.0 eV as compared to Na3PO4, Na4P2OT; K 2p3/2, by 1.7-2.1 eV as compared to K3PO4, K4P2OT; Cs 3d5/2, by 1.7-2.0 eV as compared to Cs3PO4, Cs4P207; Be Is, by 1.3-1.6 eV as compared to BeO, BeO. MOO3; Mg Is, by 1.3-1.5 eV as compared to Mg3(PO4)2; Ca 2p3/2, by 1.6-2.5 eV as compared to CaO, Ca3(PO4)2; Ba 3d5/> by 1.3-1.5 eV as compared to BaMoO4, BaSO4. Such binding energy shift, positive in all cases, may be caused by polarisation of metal atoms by strong electron acceptors like phosphorus and hydrogen, but to some extent it can be also due to a high degree of the dispersion of additives. The increase of surface P/V ratio after introduction of the additions to V-P-O catalysts, in accordance with Ref. [ 16], should influence the surface acidity. It is interesting to note that indeed the amount of adsorbed NH3 rose when the surface P/V ratio increased although no distinct correlation could be established (Fig. 2). Contrary to that, almost linear dependence between the amount of adsorbed NH3 and the surface O / (V + P + Me) ratio was obtained (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 4 shows the reversed temperature of the onset of reduction (TRO) by hydrogen in dependence on the binding energy of O 1 s electrons. It is seen that the decrease of B.E. (increase of effective negative charge on oxygen atom) corre- sponds to the decrease of TRO. It may be noted that in general, alkali and alkaline- earth metal additions lower the TRO.

Discussion Similarity of the value of Me/V obtained by XMPA, when the depth of analysis was 2/~m and the values obtained from XPS probing up to 5 nm (Table 2) and their accordance with the values of Me/V in the bulk (see Table 1 ) can be taken as an evidence of uniform distribution of additions in the basic V-P-O structure. Essentially higher values of binding energies of electrons in these elements (see above) point to a high degree of Me dispersion after their incorporation. Taking into account that bi-metal phosphate units can easily be formed in channels (voids) of vanadyl phosphate structure, it can be assumed that such units are formed on the introduction of additives and become randomly distributed in the catalyst frame- work. Their low concentration and high dispersion in the basic framework of vanadyl pyrophosphate does not allow to detect them by X-ray phase analysis. It should be noted that the phase changes in basic V-P-O composition when intro- ducing the additions of alkali metals were also not observed in other works [ 15,19,20,30]. The incorporation of elements which can easily donate electrons to the structure of vanadyl phosphate, should lead to an increase of an effective negative charge on oxygen atom as compared with unpromoted catalyst, which indeed is confirmed in general by XPS. An increase of negative charge on oxygen should cause an increase of its basic properties, and as a consequence, CO2 should adsorb on the catalyst surface, while it does not adsorb on the pure unpromoted V-P-O. Indeed, the amount of adsorbed CO2 molecules increases with the increase of effective negative charge on oxygen (decrease of B.E. of O is-electrons). The decrease of the B.E. of O 1 s-electrons on introduction of additives is accom- panied by lowering of the TRO, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This effect may be due either to the accelerated activation of hydrogen by more basic oxygen, or to the decrease of lattice energy related to the substitution of low valent cations into the crystal lattice. Introduction of additives causes also the increase of the rate of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride. The rate-determining step of this reaction is the activation of butane through abstraction of a proton [ 16,18 ]. This step should also be accelerated on increasing the basicity of surface oxygen atoms. This is indeed the case as illustrated by the linear dependence of the rate of butane oxidation on the B.E. of O 1 s-electrons (Fig. 5). Introduction of alkali and alkaline-earth metals to the V-P-O catalyst causes an increase of surface P/V ratio (Table 2). A comparison of the results obtained by XPS and XMPA shows that the enrichment of surface with phosphorus occurs at the expense of outward diffusion of overstoichiometric phosphorus through the pellet. This rise of phosphorus concentration on the surface is accompanied by simultaneous enrichment of the surface in oxygen and increase of oxygen basicity (see Table 2). Such changes in surface composition lead to corresponding changes of acidic properties of the catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the amount of adsorbed 234 V.A.

Lines show the data for sodium. For other elements such straight dependence does not always exist. base increases with rise of (P/V) s ratio. It should be noted however that essentially better correlation is observed when the amount of adsorbed base is plotted as the function of the [O/(V+P+Me)]s ratio (Fig. 3). These observations can be rationalised if it is assumed that besides the oxide ions of basic character the surface contains a certain fraction of different OH groups (not only the P-OH groups) which show enough acidic character to adsorb ammonia. Comparison of catalytic activity of samples with known surface acidity has shown that there is no correlation between these parameters. Contrary to that, the selectivity towards maleic anhydride is dependent on the amount of acidic centres at the surface catalyst, this dependence passing through a maximum (see Fig. 6). The appearance of such dependence between selectivity and acidity may be expected on the basis of the mechanism described earlier [ 16,18]. At low acidity of the surface, desorption of adsorbed acid-like products of the reaction is hindered and further oxidation occurs with COx formation. On the other hand, high acidity of the surface does not favour the adsorption of intermediates with acidic properties. It can be thus concluded that additions of alkali and alkaline-earth elements to V-P-O composition allow to change both activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The highest increase of the rate of alkane oxidation is achieved by introduction of Na, K and Cs. The rate of hydrocarbon transformation usually rises with the increase of the concentration of additives (Fig. 5 ). An increase of selectivity towards maleic V.A.

Selectivity to maleic anhydride on V-P-Me--O catalysts as a function of the amount of acidic centres. For the catalysts' composition see Tables 1 and 2. The selectivity measured at the conversion of n-butane of 30-35%. anhydride is observed after introduction of Mg, Ba and Ca and the best results may be obtained at their low concentrations (Me/V = 0.02). During the study of V-P-Li-O catalyst, attention was paid to changes in n- butane oxidation characteristics at low Li concentration, which induced the maxi- mum excess of phosphorus at the surface (see Table 2). In Ref. [ 16] it has been shown that removal of phosphorus from V-P-O catalyst surface is the main reason for the decrease of selectivity towards maleic anhydride after 300 h of time-on- stream. Cobalt introduced to vanadium-phosphorus oxide catalyst increased the surface P/V ratio and favoured the stabilisation of the sample properties. No removal of phosphorus after 300 h of time-on-stream was observed in case of such catalyst (see [16] and Fig. 7). Nevertheless, after 1500 h of V-P-Co-O catalyst work in the element of industrial unit the decrease of selectivity towards maleic anhydride has been observed. In-depth profiling of elements in catalyst pellet after 2000 h work showed that phosphorus has been carried away from the surface zone of the sample (see Fig. 7). Taking into account the mentioned influence of Li- additions, vanadium-phosphorus oxide (P/V = 1.20) catalyst simultaneously con- taining cobalt (Co/V=0.20) and lithium (Li/V=0.02) has been synthesized. Catalytic tests have shown its stable operation after 2000 h time-on-stream (see Table 3). Corresponding analysis of the in-depth profile of elements in this catalyst has confirmed the constant composition of the catalyst under these conditions (Fig. 7).

The mechanism by which the introduction of some elements modifies principal properties of the VPO system in oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been studied. The incorporation of Li, Na, K, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Ba at different concentrations which can easily donate electrons to the framework of vanadyl phosphate with P V ratio = 1.07 and 1.20, leads to an increase of the effective negative charge on oxygen atom and of the rate of butane oxidation. The presence of additives causes an increase of the surface P V ratio and corresponding changes of acidic properties of the catalysts. Selectivity towards maleic anhydride passes through a maximum when plotted as a function of the amount of acidic centres at the surface. The preparation of a catalyst characterised by high activity in butane oxidation and high selectivity to maleic anhydride requires a fine tuning of the basicity of surface oxygen atoms to accelerate the activation of butane and of the acidity of the surface to secure the appropriate residence time of the reaction intermediates.
