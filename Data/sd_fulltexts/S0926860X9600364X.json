Mumbai 400 019, India Received 27 March 1996; received in revised form 23 September 1996; accepted 4 October 1996 Abstract The production of bisphenol-A from phenol and acetone over ion exchange resins has been practised industrially, with the selectivity to the product largely depending on the type of catalyst and reaction conditions. This study reports the use of a novel catalyst based on heteropolyacid supported on clay, particularly dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTP) supported on K-10 clay and its comparison with commercially available resins such as Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst-XE-717p. DTP/K-10 is an efficient and re-usable catalyst which could be employed at higher temperatures. This catalyst is characterised by XRD, BET, SEM, FTIR and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) has been determined. The kinetics of the reaction with DTP/K-10 have shown interesting features among which the formation of intermediate isopropenyl phenol was found to be the rate determining step with the Eley-Rideal type of mechanism. Keywords: Bisphenol-A; Ion-exchange resins; Heteropolyacids 1. Introduction Bisphenol-A is a very important raw material for the synthesis of epoxy resins and other polymers. Currently two grades of bisphenol-A are manufactured; one is the epoxy grade with a purity of 95%, and the other is the polycarbonate grade with a purity >99%. Conventionally bisphenol-A is manufactured by the acid catalysed condensation of phenol and acetone. Ion exchange resins are the preferred catalysts, but these have temperature limitations.

Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 of phenol to acetone are required for a facile progress of the reaction as well as to suppress the side reactions of acetone. A large number of side-products are generated depending upon reaction conditions and the type of catalyst. An ideal catalyst for this reaction should be moderately acidic and shape selective, whereby lesser quantities of the by-products would be formed. Heteropoly acids are an interesting class of catalysts which are being used in a number of reactions [1,2]. Recently we reported a novel catalyst based on heteropoly acid supported on clay, which was found to be superior to several others including Amberlyst-15, for the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) from tert-butanol and methanol [3]. It was thought worthwhile to test its potential in the synthesis of bisphenol-A from phenol and acetone. Therefore, a systematic investigation was undertaken to compare the efficacy of dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTP) supported on K- 10 clay vis-~t-vis Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst-XE-717p, including its characterisation and the kinetics of the reaction, which are reported in this paper. 2. Literature review Due to its commercial significance, considerable information on bisphenol-A is available in the patent literature. The use of divalent sulphur compounds such as mercaptans and glycolic acids to increase the reaction rate is also indicated. Sulphonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene ion-exchange resins with a portion of the sulphonic acid groups converted into mercaptan functionality were found better catalysts than unmodified resin [4,5]. The use of zeolites coated with mercaptoamine at 120-180 has been reported [6]. Singh [7] has discussed in detail the synthesis of bisphenol-A over zeolite catalysts such as H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, H-Y and RE-Y vis-a-vis Amberlyst-15 and shown that zeolites with larger openings are more selective for this process although ion exchange resins are more active than zeolites. However, the general trend shows that modified ion exchangers are the catalysts used worldwide for an optimum yield of bisphenol-A. Alkylation of propenyl halide with phenol using Friedel Crafts catalysts for the synthesis of bisphenol-A has been reported [8]. Conversions to the extent of 60% are obtained in the above mentioned process. Some monographs mention the use of commercial acid treated clays for the synthesis of bisphenol-A [9,10]. 3. Reaction chemistry The acid catalysed condensation of phenol and acetone in homogeneous medium leads to several products; in particular with strong sulphuric and hydrochloric acids almost 28 products have been identified. Strong acids such as 70% sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphonated polystyrene divinylbenzene cation exchange G.D. Yadav, N.

Fig. 1 shows the reaction scheme. In a strong acid medium, acetone is protonated to a stable carbenium ion as shown by reaction a in Fig. 1. In the following steps, the carbenium ion adds to the limiting quinonoid structure of phenol to yield a protonated carbinol (reaction b). The carbinol rearranges to release water and yields protonated isopropenyl phenol (reaction c). The isopropenylphenol adds to a second phenol molecule to yield bisphenol-A (reaction d). Several side products are formed as shown in Fig. 2, the major one 32 G.D. Yadav, N.

Other side products are the chroman derivatives formed by the reaction of phenol with mesityl oxide, which itself is a product of self-condensation of acetone followed by dehydration (reaction e, G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 33 Fig. 2). Out of the 28 products mentioned, those which are formed in relatively larger quantities are 2,2,4-trimethyl chromen, 1,1,3-trimethyl-5-indanol, 9,9- dimethylxanthane and dimethyl hydroxy biphenyl. The remaining by products constitute to less than 0.2% of the reaction mixture. It is obvious from Fig. 2 that the formation of byproducts can be suppressed if the self- condensation of acetone followed by dehydration leading to mesityl oxide is avoided. One of the ways would be to employ excess of phenol over acetone in batch experiments or semi- batch mode of operation with continuous addition of acetone making the phenol to acetone ratio very high. 4. Experimental 4.1. Chemicals and catalysts The preparation of alumina, zirconia, chromia exchanged clays and heteropoly acid supported on clays has been detailed elsewhere [3,11]. Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst XE-717p were procured from Rohm and Haas (USA). K-10 and Filtrol-24 were purchased from Fluka (Switzerland) and Engelhardt (Germany), respectively. Phenol and acetone were obtained from M/s s.d. Fine Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. 4.2. Preparation of dodecatungstophosphoric acid (dtp) supported on clay (DTP/K-IO) Heteropoly acids (HPA) have been supported on silica, titania, alumina, etc. and the preparatory procedures are well standardised [ 12]. We reported for the first time the use of a novel catalyst heteropoly acid supported on clay [3], the preparation of which is given below. Approximately 10 g of K-10 clay was dried in an oven at 120 for 1 h of which 8 g were weighed for subsequent experiment. 2 g of dry DTP was also weighed. The HPA was dissolved in 8 ml of dry methanol. This volume of solvent was approximately equal to the pore volume of the catalyst. The solution was added in aliquots of 1 ml each to the clay under constant stirring with a glass rod or kneading it properly. The solution was added at time intervals of 30 sec. Initially and up to the addition of 6 ml of the DTP solution, the clay was in the powdery form but upon subsequent addition the clay formed a paste. Further kneading of the paste for 10 min. yielded a dry free flowing powder. The preformed catalyst was dried in an oven at 120 for 1 h and then calcined at 275 for 3 h. Two factors were found to be important in the preparation of supported heteropoly acids: calcination temperature and heteropoly acid loading on the clay, the details of which we have discussed earlier [3]. 34 G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 5. Characterisation of catalysts 5.1. X-ray diffraction studies The X-ray diffractograms were recorded with a Rigaku automated diffract- ometer. The X-ray target was the Cu Ks (1=1.5402 ,~). The X-ray pattern of K-10 is given in Fig. 3a. It shows an ill-defined peak at 5correspondin~ to a d-spacing of 17 ,~. This diffraction band extends from about 10 A to 17-19 Awith a plateau inclined towards 17 ,~ which has been discussed by Laszlo [9]. The exact reason for such a peak is not known though it could be speculated that it was caused due to the presence of lattice debris produced during the acid treatment of montmorillonite. The d(001) spacing is attributed to the sharp peak observed at 20=9 The peak at 20=18is the d(003) spacing as suggested by Slaughter and Milne [13]. There are several other sharp peaks which are indicative that K-10 is still crystalline. The peak at 20=27is assigned to c~-quartz. In the diffractogram of DTP/K-10 the peaks are less intense indicating that in the impregnation process, the clay has lost some of its crystallinity compared to K-10. The intensity of the d(001) peak at 20=10is also subdued. Most of the diffractogram for DTP/K-10 is similar to that of K-10. (Fig. 3b) 5.2. Surface area measurement The surface areas of the K-10 and DTP/K-10 were measured by the BET method using the nitrogen adsorption technique on an indigenously made apparatus and were found to be 230 m2/g and 107 m2/g, respectively. The catalysts were pre- dried at 275 overnight prior to the analysis. The surface area of DTP/K-10 was found to be 50% lower than that of K-10. Since both the catalysts are pre-treated in a similar way prior to analysis the reduction in surface area in the case of DTP/K-10 could primarily be due to the ' ' b ' ' '0 ,~0 35 3 25 20 1 1 20 Fig. 3.

It appears that the active species are held in a few junctions of such dimensions from where the access to smaller pores is denied, thereby leading to reduction in accessible surface area. The particle size of K-10 and DTP/K-10 was determined by image analysis (Tracor Northern TN 8500) as 80-100 lam. 5.3. Scanning electron microscopy The SEM was performed on a CAMECA (France) instrument. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the micrographs of K-10 and DTP/K-10, respectively. A distinct difference between the two is found. In the case of the DTP/K-10 there are a lot of dispersed particles on the surface of the support K-10. 5.4. Cation exchange capacities (CEC) The CEC of the catalysts were determined photometrically by methylene blue adsorption, as described by Robertson and Ward [14] and were found to be 35 and 39 meq/100 g for K-10 and DTP/K-10, respectively. The CEC of K-10 closely agrees with the values given by Clark et al. [15]. The CEC of DTP/K-10 exhibits a slightly higher value than K-10. It could be due to some additional surface protons which come by way of heteropoly acid impreg- nation which may play a role on account of easy availability for the exchange reaction. 5.5. Fourier transform infra-red spectra (FTIR) FTIR studies of the catalysts were conducted by using a Bruker IFS-66 single channel Fourier transform spectrophotometer. Thin wafers were prepared by mixing 3 mg of the catalysts with 50 mg of KBr. The wafers were subjected to 200 scans after which the spectra were recorded. Fig. 5(a) shows the FTIR scan of K-10. Very prominent bands are observed in the region between 600 and 3000 cm-1. The broad band stretching from 900- 1200 cm-1 is due to the Si-O stretching vibration and the shoulder at 935 cm-1 is indicative of-~)H groups bonded to the A1 atoms. Bands in the range 533- 807 cm-1 are assigned to Si-O and Si-O-A1 vibrations. The band at 1642 cm-~ is attributed to -OH bending frequency of water molecules and the band at 3431.6 cm-~ is attributed to the structural hydroxy stretching vibration. Fig. 5 (b) shows the scan of DTP. The scan matches very well with that of Kozhevnikov et al. [16] and Sharpless and Munday [17]. The following prominent bands are observed. 1087.8cmI (P-O), 989.5cm-l (W=O), 898.3 cm-1, stretching vibration of W-O-W bridges between comer sharing octahedra and 800 cm 1 stretching vibrations of W-O-W bridges between edge sharing octahedra [ 18]. i G.D.

The scan of DTP/K-10, (Fig. 5c) is similar to that of K-10 except that there is a prominent peak at 821.1 cm-1 which is indicative of W-O-W vibrations. How- ever, the shift observed for this peak when compared to pure DTP could be attributed to the interaction between DTP and K-10. 5. 6. Stability of DTP on clay It was necessary to study the stability of DTP on K-10 in order to reuse the catalyst. Any leaching of the active sites from the catalyst would render it ' \"7 e- I-- 4000 G.D. Yadav, N.

Our reaction studies for the synthesis of MTBE from t- butanol and methanol showed that the DTP/K-10 showed constant activity for a minimum of four runs even in the presence of a polar solvent such as methanol and also 1,4 dioxane [3]. It was therefore decided to verify the possibility of leaching of DTP from the support under severe conditions. 38 G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 HPA could be analysed by the heteropoly blue colour which is observed when it is made to react with a mild reducing agent such as ascorbic acid [19]. This property was utilised for the quantitative determination of leaching, if any. Standard samples amounting to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% of DTP in water were prepared. To 10 ml of the above samples 1 ml of 10% ascorbic acid was added. The mixture was diluted to 25 ml. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at Amax of 785 cm-1. A standard calibration curve was obtained by plotting the absorbance with of DTP in aqueous solution. 10 g of DTP/K-10 was taken in 25 ml of methanol and the mixture was refluxed. 1 ml aliquot of the refluxing solution was withdrawn to which 1 ml of 10% ascorbic acid solution was added. The solution was diluted to 25 ml and the absorbance was measured at the Areax value of 785 cm-1. It was observed that up to a period of 3 h there was a loss of 3% of the loaded DTP. The above tests were repeated to find out if the leaching was indeed negligible. Leaching would have taken place if the heteropoly acid were loosely bound to the clay matrix. Additionally, the heat treatment does not modify the characteristics of DTP. The absence of coloration could be attributed only to the absence of any free HPA in the solution. It was therefore concluded that the DTP was chemically adsorbed on the catalyst surface and no leaching was observed. In the presence of acetone and phenol thus no leaching was expected in the presence of acetone and phenol. 6. Experimental 6.1. Reaction procedure All the experiments were carried out in a 100 ml Parr autoclave equipped with a four bladed turbine impeller. The temperature was maintained within i0.5 of the desired value. The vessel was also equipped with a speed regulator that could maintain the desired speed at + 1% of the set value. Predetermined quantities of reactants and the catalyst were charged into the autoclave and the temperature was raised to the desired value. Once the tempera- ture was attained the initial sample was withdrawn at time=0 and the stirrer was started. Further samples were withdrawn at definite time intervals. A typical experiment consisted of 5.28 g (0.091 gmol) of acetone, 42.77 g (0.451 gmol) of phenol, 1.25 g of catalyst (loading of catalyst, 0.0268 g/cm3 of the liquid phase). The reaction temperature was maintained at 100 and 135 for the ion exchange resins and inorganic catalysts, respectively. 6.2. Analysis The samples were analysed in a gas chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer Model 8500) equipped with a flame ionisation detector. A 2 0.003 m column packed with 10% G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 39 OV-17 supported on chromosorb WHP was used. Calibration curves were prepared by using standard samples and synthetic mixtures in order to quantify the data. 7. Results and discussion 7.1. Comparison of the activity of the catalysts A maximum of six products were detected in the reaction mixture. The products were identified as 1,1,3-trimethyl-5-indenol, 2,2,4-trimethyl chromen, 9,9- dimethyl xanthane, dimethyl hydroxy biphenyl, o,p-l-bisphenol and bisphenol- A. In the case of Amberlyst-31 and Ambedyst-XE-717p only o,p-l-bisphenol and bisphenol-A were formed, whereas in the case of Amberlyst-15, all the by products were formed in large quantities resulting in a lower selectivity to bisphenol-A. Since it was desired to test the efficacy of dodecatungstophosphoric acid supported on K-10, a few experiments were also conducted with the support clay K-10 as well as Filtrol-24 as shown in Table 1. Both K-10 and Filtrol-24 were rather ineffective. As was expected, Lewis acid type catalysts, such as alumina exchanged K-10, zirconia exchanged K-10, chromia exchanged K-10 and sulphated zirconia calcined at 650 did not show any conversion at 135 after 4 h of reaction The Bronsted acid type catalyst were more effective. In the absence of diffusional effects the performance of the various catalysts is commented upon in what follows. K-10, an acid treated clay, is obtained by the acid treatment of the Bavarian montmorillonite Tonsil-13. This catalyst has some amount of residual acidity which may catalyse many reactions. Exchanged clays are modified forms of the precursor K-10. During the preparation of exchanged clays, the precursor K-10 was washed free of any residual acidity making it less Table 1 Activity of different catalysts for the synthesis of bisphenol-A Catalyst Conversion (%) Selectivity (%) K-10 2 0 Filtrol-24 7 3 Alumina Ex.K-10 0 0 Zirconia Ex.K-10 0 0 Chromia Ex.K- 10 0 0 Amberlyst- 15 10 30 DTP/K- 10 23 60 Amberlyst-31 24 82 Amberlyst XE-717p 60 90 TGA/DTP/K- 10 13 83 Acetone: 0.091 gmol, phenol: 0.451 gmol, catalyst: 1.25g, temperature: 135, Mole ratio acet- one:PhOH=l : 5. In the case of ion exchangers the temperature was 100, time: 4 h. 40 G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 acidic [ 11 ]. As a result the extent of activity observed over K-10 was not noticed in the exchanged clays. DTP/K-10 has a higher amount of Bronsted acidity by way of the additional acidity conferred by the supported heteropoly acid. This catalyst is highly active in a number of reactions which we have studied including the one under current investigation. Amberlyst-15 is a sulphonated polystyrene divinyl- benzene having a CEC of 400 me/ql00 gm of resin [20]. Literature mentions that ion-exchangers promoted with mercaptans have enhanced selectivity to bisphenol- A. Amberlyst-31 is a polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene where the extent of cross-linking is 4%. This relatively low cross-linking enables the ion- exchanger to swell to a larger extent in the reaction medium allowing larger molecules to enter the pore network. This catalyst is specifically used for sucrose, lactose and bisphenol-A synthesis and has a greater CEC (490 meq / 100 g resin) than Amberlyst- 15 [20]. Amberlyst-XE-717p is a promoted ion-exchanger where 17% of the acid sites are promoted with an undisclosed molecule [21]. The activity of the catalyst and selectivity for bisphenol-A were very high. The exchange with any sulphur compound reduces the acidity of the catalyst, whereby the yield of bisphenol- A is increased. The main side reactions were of acetone, particularly the formation of mesitylene and its subsequent reactions. The mesitylene reactions are promoted by strong acidic sites. The sulphur compounds selectively poison the strong acidic sites which are responsible for side reactions. The activity and selectivity of Amberlyst-15 are much lower than over DTP/K-10 and Amberlyst-31, both of which having similar activities; but the latter being more selective. Amberlyst XE- 717p is more active and selective than both DTP/K-10 and Amberlyst-31. However, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst-XE-717p, like any other ion exchanger have very poor thermal stability. They can be used at a maximum temperature of 120. By contrast, the clay modified catalysts can be used at temperatures as high as 300. The lower selectivity of bisphenol-A with DTP/K-10 could be due to its high acidity giving rise to a variety of by-products. If the acidity of the catalyst is controlled by reducing the activity of some of the sites; for instance, by doping with sulphur compounds the formation of byproducts could be lowered. Further, some reactions can occur on the external surface of the catalysts without any shape selectivity. It was thought desirable to study the kinetics of this reaction with DTP/K-10 as the catalyst. The effect of various parameters was studied under otherwise similar conditions at a standard temperature of 135. 7.2. Effect of speed of agitation Fig. 6 shows the conversion of acetone at different time intervals. The conver- sions were found to remain practically the same at speeds beyond 1000 rpm thereby indicating absence of solid-liquid mass transfer resistance. Further reac- tions were conducted at a speed of 1000 rpm.

Effect of catalyst loading Fig. 7 shows the plot of initial rate of reaction of acetone (roi, gmol/cm3/s) against catalyst loading (w, g/cm3). It indicates that the rate of reaction increases linearly up to a loading of 2.6z 10-2 g/cm3 and thereafter remains constant even though the loading is almost doubled. Since the number of acidic sites available in the reaction medium is proportional to the available intra-particle surface, the initial rate of reaction of acetone should be directly proportional to catalyst loading (mass/volume) if there are no intra-particle diffusion limitations. This indicates the following: An intra-particle diffusion limitation was set in for the transfer of acetone from the exterior surface of catalyst beyond a solid loading of 2.6x l0 2 g/cm3, acetone being the limiting reactant (CAo << Cpo). The side reactions were also significant due to extra available active sites. It clearly demonstrated that mass transfer limitations were set in and not all internal surface area was utilised for the reaction. In fact, the acetone concentration would become zero at a certain distance from the centre of the particle and the reaction would become intra-particle mass transfer controlled. Further experi- ments were therefore done at catalyst a loading of 2.6 x l0-2 g/cm3 in the absence of intra particle resistance. 42 G.D. Yadav, N.

The conversions at 120 are linear with respect to time showing zero-order depen- dence on acetone concentration. The other two lines indicate non-zero order dependence which will be discussed later in the kinetic interpretation. 7.5. Effect of mole ratio In the industrial processes for the manufacture of bisphenol-A, phenol to acetone molar ratio of 10 : 1 is normally maintained because at higher molar ratios the formation of by-products is lowered. All the standard runs mentioned above were carried out with phenol to acetone molar ratios of 5 : 1. In addition, a mole ratio of 3 : 1 was also studied. Fig. 9 shows the conversion data with time for the different mole ratios studied. The conversions at a mole ratio of 10 : 1 are marginally better than those at a ratio of 5 : 1. 7.6.

The idea of using thioglycolic acid was to enhance the selectivity and to suppress the side reactions of acetone. It was desirable to confirm whether the above complex was formed or not. Therefore thioglycolic acid was added in two different modes. In the first case, thioglycolic acid was added homogeneously to the reaction mixture when no reaction was found to occur and in the second case, a known equivalence of thioglycolic acid amounting to 50% by mole of the heteropoly acid was loaded on the catalyst surface by the incipient wetness impregnation (Table 1). The purpose of loading thioglycolic acid was to subdue the activity of the catalyst by poisoning some of the more acid sites. Thus the selectivity to the desired product could be greatly enhanced by controlling the acidity. It was found that at a suitable loading of thioglycolic acid the selectivity to bisphenol-A increased but the loadings above a critical point made the catalyst totally inactive. Fig. 10 shows the plot of conversions with time when thioglycolic acid was loaded on the catalyst. 8. Reaction mechanism and kinetics 8.1. Development of mechanistic model The kinetics of the reaction of phenol and acetone in heptane as solvent and in the presence of sulphonated poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) to give G.D. Yadav, iV. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 45 bisphenol-A and water has been measured and represented by the following equation [23,24]. kKACAK2C2 rate = (1 + KACA + KwCw)(1 + KpCp -}- KHCH)2 where A is acetone, P is phenol, W is water and H is the solvent, n-heptane, which acts as an inhibitor, K's are the respective adsorption equilibrium constants and k is the rate constant. The above equation also suggests that there are two types of sites on the polymer surface whereupon acetone and water compete for one type, and phenol and heptane for another. Acetone and water are more polar and they bond to -SO3H groups, whereas heptane and the aromatic ring of phenol have affinity for the hydrocarbon backbone and aromatic rings of the polymer. There could be several possible reaction products, but those in Fig. 2 were detected at the end of the reaction in the current work. The initial rate data can be analysed on the basis of Langmuir-Hinshelwood- Hougen-Watson (LHHW) or Eley-Rideal mechanisms. Since the selec- tivities were higher over for DTP/K-10, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst XE- 717p, a simple model is presented below. Due to the presence of heptane, Renicker and Gates [24] assumed two types of sites, which are likely to be present in a polymeric support. This situation may not exist if no solvent is used or when phenol reacts from solution with adsorbed acetone in DTP/K-10 which is an inorganic catalyst. In the case of the present studies, the kinetics of the reaction is established for the DTP/K-10 catalyst assuming the same type of sites (S) as shown in Fig. 11. The conversion data points were so selected that the formation of by-products was minimum and the integral form of the rate equation was used. For initial rate data, the following analysis is the most appropriate. Adsorption of acetone (A) on a vacant site S is given by: /CA A+S ~ AS. (1) Adsorption of phenol (P) is represented by: Kp P+S ~ PS. (2) But adsorbed phenol does not react. It only poisons the sites. It is the phenol from the liquid phase that reacts with AS, according to the Eley-Rideal mechanism. Reaction of AS with P from the liquid phase in the pore space gives an intermediate: AS+P ~ I~S.

(lO) The concentration of vacant sites Cs is therefore: Ct Cs = (1 + KACA q- KpCp -[- KBCB Jr- KwCw) ' (11) 8.2. Controlling mechanism Two important cases of the controlling mechanism are considered here Case I: If the overall rate of reaction (ro) is controlled by Eq. (3) i.e. the reaction between chemisorbed acetone (AS) and phenol (P) from the liquid phase, according to the Eley-Rideal mechanism then: -dCe ro = rp -- d~ -- kR~CAsCp (12) kRIKACACsCp kR, KA CA CpCt (1 + KACA -[- KpCp + KBCB -[- KwCw) \" Case H: On the contrary if Eq. (6) is the rate controlling one, i.e. the reaction of chemisorbed p-isopropenyl phenol (I2S) with phenol (P) from the liquid phase 48 G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 then, overall the rate of reaction is given by: -dCp ro = rp -- d~- -- kR2CIESCp (13) -~ kR2KiCltsCp = kR2KIkR, CAs (Cp)2 kR2kRl K1KACA (Cp) 2 Ct (1 + KACA + KpCp + KBC. + KwCw) There are several subcases possible depending on the relative rates of adsorption of the various species. In the case of DTP/K-10, the following significant cases are presented. 8.3. Adsorption of acetone alone is significant This situation exists if (1 + KACA) >> (KpCp -~- KBCB \"~ KwCw). Since no poisoning of the catalyst was observed by phenol, water or bisphenol-A during preliminary experiments, this assumption appeared to be valid. Case I: If Eq. (3) is the rate determining step, then Eq. (12) becomes: -dCp kR, KACACpCt ro ---- rp -- -- -- (14) dt (1 + KACA) \" The total sites concentration Ct can be written in terms of the catalyst loading w (in mass/volume) because the number of sites are proportional to w. Thus Eq. (14) can be rewritten as -dCp k'RIwKACACp ro = rp -- -- -- (15) dt (1 +KACA) ' where U incorporates the proportionality constant of Ct o~ w. R1 If the initial rates (roi) are measured, then Eq. (15) can be transformed into a very convenient form as given below: Cpo. w 1 1 -~ (16) ' k' \" roi kRl KA CAo R I A plot of t(Cpo, w ) / roi] against 1/CAo yields a slope of (k'R1 KA)-I and an intercept of (MR1)- from which both the reaction rate constant Um and adsorption equili- brium constant KA could be established. Case II: On the contrary if Eq. (6) is the rate determining step, then i ! 2 kR2kRIwKIKA C A Cp (17) ro = rp = (I + KACA) G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 An equation of the same form as Eq. (16) can be written as follows: C2o w 1 1 roi kKCA kK~ ' where k--kRzk~Rl and K = KAK~. Further treatment to calculate k and analogous. 49 (18) K is 8.4. Establishment of reaction kinetics Eq. (17) suggests that the rate of reaction is a strong function of phenol concentration and a slight increase in it over that of acetone, under otherwise similar conditions, will lead to substantial increase in the rate of reaction. However, the effect of mole ratio represented by Fig. 9 suggests that the rates do not increase as greatly as expected. A plot of (Cpo'W/ro) against (1/CAo) as suggested by Eq. (16) is shown in Fig. 12. It is seen that the equation fits the data well thereby proving that step 3 i.e., the reaction between chemisorbed acetone (AS) and phenol (P) from the liquid phase is the rate determining step and the overall rate of reaction is given by Eq. (15). From the intercept k~l is obtained as 0.18 (cm3/g s), and subsequently from the slope/CA is obtained as 119.5 (cm3/gmol) Since the system was found to obey the Eley-Rideal type of mechanism, it was thought worthwhile to study the effect of temperature on the reaction rate and selectivity. It is expected that/CA, the adsorption equilibrium constant will be lower o 7\"2 o c.) :/ ~ .*lJ~llhlltJJI,ihllrJJJidlrlJlllldl~t~Jiiih~llllrl~JInlEiJJl~ll~lldlJiiJiII dl~Jllll,i 1 2[ :3 4 5 6 7 B 9 10 (1/C,o)xlO-2, (gruel/eroS)-1 Fig. 12.

The slope is equal to 0.34 cm6/gmol gm s representing kl which is a product of kfR1KA. This value can be compared with that obtained at 135 to find that it is reasonable because k~l increases with temperature whereas KA decreases. This is a further proof that step 3 is the rate determining step. Thus, at lower temperatures I+KACA could be taken as equivalent to KACA, thereby making Eq. (14) as: ro = rp = k' Cpw (21) R1 = Constant if Cpo >> CAo for the same catalyst loading. At a mole ratio of M~5, the above equation suggests that the reaction rate will be zero order in acetone concentration and the acetone conversion will be linear with time. Inspection of Fig. 8 as well as the comments made earlier under the effect of temperature reiterate these observations. The slope of this plot gives a value of G.D. Yadav, N. Kirthivasan/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 29-53 51 8.330-6 s-1 from which using Eq. (21) k'Rx is obtained as 6.410-3 cm6/ gmol g s which is 28 times less than that at 135. Thus the kinetic model presented here shows very interesting behaviour which fits the experimental data well under different reaction conditions. The effect of temperature shows that the model could be tested quite satisfactorily. 9. Conclusions The reaction of phenol and acetone was studied over different catalysts. DTP/K- 10, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst XE-717p were found to be better catalysts. DTP/K-10 is reusable and better as regards its use at higher temperatures. The kinetics was studied with DTP/K-10 as catalyst where the rate determining step is the formation of p-isopropenylphenol from chemisorbed acetone and phenol from the liquid phase within pores according to Eley-Rideal mechanism. The catalyst was characterised fully. By taking higher mole ratio of phenol to acetone, a number of byproducts are avoided. The kinetic model was found to fit the data satisfactorily. 10.

Synthesis of bisphenol-A: comparison of efficacy of ion exchange resin catalysts vis-à-vis heteropolyacid supported on clay and kinetic modelling G.D. Yadav * N. Kirthivasan Chemical Engineering Division, University Department of Chemical Technology (UDCT), University of Mumbai, Matunga, Mumbai 400 019, India * Corresponding author. Fax: (+91-22) 4145614. The production of bisphenol-A from phenol and acetone over ion exchange resins has been practised industrially, with the selectivity to the product largely depending on the type of catalyst and reaction conditions. This study reports the use of a novel catalyst based on heteropolyacid supported on clay, particularly dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTP) supported on K-10 clay and its comparison with commercially available resins such as Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst-XE-717p. DTP/K-10 is an efficient and re-usable catalyst which could be employed at higher temperatures. This catalyst is characterised by XRD, BET, SEM, FTIR and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) has been determined. The kinetics of the reaction with DTP/K-10 have shown interesting features among which the formation of intermediate isopropenyl phenol was found to be the rate determining step with the Eley-Rideal type of mechanism.

This study reports the use of a novel catalyst based on heteropolyacid supported on clay, particularly dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTP) supported on K-10 clay and its comparison with commercially available resins such as Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-31 and Amberlyst-XE-717p. DTP/K-10 is an efficient and re-usable catalyst which could be employed at higher temperatures. This catalyst is characterised by XRD, BET, SEM, FTIR and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) has been determined. The kinetics of the reaction with DTP/K-10 have shown interesting features among which the formation of intermediate isopropenyl phenol was found to be the rate determining step with the Eley-Rideal type of mechanism.",
