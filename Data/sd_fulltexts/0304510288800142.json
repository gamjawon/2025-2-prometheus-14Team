CANT School of Chemisty, Macquarie University, N.S.W. 2109 (Australia) (Received July 15,1987; accepted December 4, 1987) Summary The hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate on Raney copper catalysts has been previously suggested to proceed via dissociative adsorption followed by hydrogenation of adsorbed fragments. As part of a programme to study ester hydrogenolysis, the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde, which could be suggested to involve similar adsorbed fragments, has been examined. The kinetics of the reactions of ester and aldehyde with hydrogen are found to be different, and isotopic labelling techniques show that the intermediates are probably different. Acetaldehyde hydrogenation appears to involve adsorption through oxygen followed by attachment of adsorbed atomic hydrogen to the oxygen. Aldehyde hydrogenation is much faster than ester hydrogenolysis, by a factor of 6000, under identical conditions. Introduction The use of copper-based catalysts for ester hydrogenolysis is well established [1-4], the reaction being suggested to involve the dissociative adsorption of the ester followed by hydrogenation of the adsorbed frag- ments [4]. Ethyl acetate, for example, has been suggested to produce ethoxy and acetyl fragments, the hydrogenation of the latter being rate determining [4]. It might be suggested that similar fragments may be produced from acetaldehyde: CHaCHO + '- > CHaCHO* (1) CHaCHO* + H* > CHyCH^O* + * (2) CH3CH20* + H* > CHaCH^OH + 2* (3) As a result, attention was focused on the hydrogenation of acetal- dehyde adsorbed on the ion-exchanged copper on silica catalyst used to study the hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate [5]. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 248 The hydrogenation of aldehydes to alcohols is important on an in- dustrial scale, with nickel-based catalysts being used to promote the reaction [6, 7]. The reactivity order for hydrogenation has been reported [8] as: aldehydes > ketones > olefins but no work on the kinetics of acetaldehyde hydrogenation on copper- based catalysts has been found. Experimental The experiments employed two batches of silica-supported copper made by the ion-exchange method of Kobayashi et al. [9] as developed by Kohler et al. [10]. The support was a fumed silica of surface area 200 m2 g~1 (Aerosil 200, Degussa AG). One sample contained 4.4 wt.% copper (copper surface area 11 m2 g~1 [10]) and was part of the preparation used for acetate hydrogenolysis [5]. The second contained 6.8 wt.% copper (copper surface area 16.5 m2 g~1 [10]) and exhibited the same catalytic behaviour. Rate measurements were carried out in a conventional flow apparatus under differential conditions. The system employed three streams, a primary hydrogen (or helium) stream which passed through a saturator containing acetaldehyde (Merck > 99% pure), a second hydrogen (or deuterium) stream and a helium stream. In this way the percentages of acetaldehyde and hydrogen in the flow could be independently adjusted. The flow of each stream was controlled by Nupro metering valves and continuously monitored with Brooks type 5810 flow sensors. The combined flow was fed at near atmosphere pressure over 0.05 - 0.3 g of Cu/SiOz of particle size 400 - 600 Jum contained in a U-tube reactor. Reduction was carried out with diluted H2 overnight with the temperature slowly being raised to 573 K. For kinetic work the total flow was 1000 cm3 min~1 and the catalyst was mixed with five times its mass of silica support which had been treated and sieved as in the catalyst preparation but omitting the copper solution. To save isotope, the experiments with deuterium employed a total flow of ca. 100 cm3 min~1 and the support diluent was omitted. The product stream and the reactant stream could be sampled by Vaico 6 or 10 port valves and analysed by gas chromatography using a 2 m Porapak Q column maintained at 463 K. Peak areas were determined with a Hewlett Packard 3390A integrator and converted to mole fraction using appropriate relative molar response factors. The deuterium experiments were carried out in a manner similar to that described previously [5]. The entire organic fraction was condensed out in a U-tube trap cooled in dry ice. 0.5 ml samples of the collected liquid were analysed by *H and ^ NMR using a Varian XL200 instrument oper- ated at 200 MHz for ^ and 30.7 MHz for ^ A few /xl of a 1:1 mixture of C^Hfi and CgDg were included in each sample to allow normalisation between 249 ^ and ^ peak integrals. The spectra were somewhat complicated by forma- tion of acetals and hemiacetals from reaction between product ethanol and acetaldehyde on standing, but calculation of the relative amounts of ^ and 2]-! at a total of five positions in the mixture was still possible. Results Reaction kinetics Ethanol was found to be the only product of reaction except under low hydrogen: aldehyde ratios and high residence times, when small traces of ethyl acetate were observed. Such conditions were avoided in the experi- ments described below. No carbon oxides or methane were observed. Freshly reduced samples of catalyst were found to deactivate with time. The extent of deactivation increased with acetaldehyde pressure and partial regeneration of the catalyst was achieved by passage of hydrogen under reaction conditions: complete regeneration was possible if the catalyst was reduced as for a fresh sample. Acetaldehyde is known to polymerise on copper [11] and deactivation is attributed to the formation of surface polymer. Catalyst activity eventually reaches a near steady state condition, and kinetics were measured once the catalyst had achieved this situation. Rate measurements were made under differential conditions (<10% conversion), with rate being calculated from the equation: Tp -y rateOnolgeat-1!!-^-^-'1 (4) where F^ and X^ are the feed rate and fractional conversion of acetaldehyde, respectively, and W is the weight of the catalyst. Preliminary experiments, carried out with different feed rates and catalyst particle sizes, showed that the results were not affected by diffusion. The apparent reaction orders with respect to hydrogen and to acetal- dehyde were measured at 398 K for experiments in which the total flow rate and the partial pressure of one reactant was held constant while the partial pressure of the other was varied. Results observed are compared with those reported for the hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate on the same catalyst [5] in Table 1. An apparent activation energy of 69 ( 1) kJ mol~1 was measured for the temperature range 380 - 435 K. It is seen from these results that the hydrogenation of ester is many times faster than the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde. Therefore, it is obvious that different reaction mechanisms must be operating, and attention was directed at the elucidation of the difference through the use of isotopic labelling techniques. Reactions with deuterium Table 2 details the results of experiments in which acetaldehyde with hydrogen and deuterium alternatively were fed to the reaction at identical 250 TABLE 1 Rate data for acetaldehyde hydrogenation and ethyl acetate hydrogenolysis CHaCHO + Hz -> CHaCHiOH CHsCOOCH^CHy + 2Hi -- 2CH3CH20H1\" order in Hi 0.63*' 0.88 order in 0.04 0.02 organic Eo/kJ mol\"1 69<1 107 Temperature 365 K 533 K for turnover frequency of 10-\"3 s-^ Turnover 0.084 1.4 X lO\"5 frequency at 453 K6'* calculated from information in [5].

Because of the relatively high acetaldehyde pressures and con- versions employed to provide sufficient product without undue deuterium consumption, deactivation was quite noticeable with hydrogen as reductant. 251 TABLE 3 Distribution of deuterium in products of reaction between acetaldehyde and deuterium*.

If anything there was a slight recovery in activity whilst feeding deuterium, presumably because of the lower rate. The kinetic isotope effect, r-ajr^, calculated from average values of rate in the two reactants, was 2.0. The results of NMR analysis of the collected organic fraction when feeding deuterium are shown in Table 3. With ethanol the distribution is close to that expected for the reaction: CHaCHO + Dz > CHaCHDOD (5) i.e. 50% deuterium in the methylene position and approaching 100% deute- rium on the oxygen. Deuterium is also present to an extent of about 3% in the methyl groups of both ethanol and acetaldehyde. The near equality indicates that methyl group exchange takes place in acetaldehyde initially, with no further exchange during and after the conversion of ethanol. By contrast, exchange at the CHO position of acetaldehyde is not significant. Whilst deuterium in the methyl groups of reactant is small in percentage terms, it is a very significant repository in terms of the carbon-bound deuterium of the combined organic fraction (which is predominantly acetaldehyde at the conversion employed). The point is exemplified by the figures shown in parentheses in Table 3. The quantity of deuterium ex- changed into acetaldehyde is approximately the same as that placed in ethanol by the reaction itself. This relates to the nature of the surface species which must be present. Discussion Comparison of the rates of reaction between hydrogen and ethyl acetate or acetaldehyde shows significant differences (Table 1) and, as a result, it is unlikely that the acetate and the aldehyde react via the same intermediate. Attention was then directed to the possible reaction mech- anism of acetaldehyde hydrogenation. Exchange of deuterium into the methyl groups but not the aldehyde position of acetaldehyde is indicative of keto-enol conversion on the sur- face, i.e. 252 H ^H H H >-C ^=t + >=C (6) H \"0 H H '0 \" : i i with introduction of deuterium at the methyl position of the keto form on reversal. Benziger and Madix [12] have discussed the energy requirements for stability of the enolate form of acetaldehyde on metals. Their calcula- tions and XPS measurements indicate that it is favoured on iron. The methyl group exchange observed here indicates that the enolate also forms on copper, with an interchange rate back to the keto form which is about equal to that of the hydrogenation (Table 3). Even so, it is clear that the enol form is not the surface species from which ethanol is formed by reaction with deuterium, since this would place one deuterium atom on the methyl group of every ethanol product molecule. Rather, the initial attack must be on the keto species. The evidence strongly suggests that this attack must involve atomic hydrogen rather than a molecular species. The exchange reaction between hydrogen and deuterium [13] and ethanol and deuterium [5] are close to equilibrium at 419 K under conditions similar to those used here. Their estimated turnover frequencies exceed values for the acetaldehyde hy- drogenation (Table 1) by several orders of magnitude. As a result, rapid formation of H and D atoms on the surface must occur. The magnitude of the kinetic isotope effect (ry/r^ =2.0) is also about that expected for a rate determining step in which a Cu H (versus Cu D) bond is broken. In terms of the simplest model, the inferred difference in zero point energy is 5200 J mol~1. This corresponds to CuH and CuD stretching frequencies of 1500 and 1100 cm\"1 respectively, assuming a ratio of 1.4. These are about as expected for a bond strength of 240 kJ moF1 (as calculated from the heat of adsorption of 40 kJ mol~1 found by Pritchard [14,15] for molecular hydrogen adsorption on high-index planes of copper and the bond dissociation energy of 436 kJ mol\"1 for molecular hydrogen). For hydrogen atom addition to acetaldehyde, the most plausible step at first sight is: CH3 H -< r't-i _p 4. t-r ^ CHi CH3 S) f o (7) J_ _ _ Scheme 1. The surface ethoxy product is a well-established species [16,17], and ready conversion to ethanol would be expected given the rapidity of the CH3CH20H/D2 exchange process [5]. There is, however, a problem in 253 explaining the observed kinetic orders with this scheme. The rate should be proportional to the product of the surface coverages of acetaldehyde, (6^) and hydrogen atoms (9y), i.e.: rate = kB^y (8) For competitive Langmuir adsorption with dissociation, one expects: v i/2p 1/2 -CX.U S-W Q =; _______\"a \"i________ (Q\\ H l+^PH^+W, ' ' where K = the adsorption coefficient and the S.8',P, term reflects the inhibi- tion of hydrogen dissociation by acetaldehyde and possibly ethanol. The dependence of 9y, and hence the rate, on gas phase hydrogen pressure should then not exceed a power of 0.5. However, the experimental value is greater than 0.5 and this mechanism thus cannot be correct. As an alternative, the reaction mechanism might involve the initial attack on the oxygen of the adsorbed aldehyde. CHg ^H CHa / 'C. + H ^= \\^OH (10^ \"0 CHa H C- 011 + H > CHaCHaOH (11) Scheme 2. Reaction 10 is in equilibrium, the partially hydrogenated intermediate reacting with adsorbed atomic hydrogen to produce ethanol. In these terms, it is possible to derive a Langmuir-Hinshelwood expres- sion based on these equations: , ^ __________fe^'A^A-^Ha^H;___________ ,,ov rave [i+^Ad+d+^x^pH,)172}]2 \\ / where K^ and K^ are the adsorption equilibrium constants for aldehyde and hydrogen respectively and K^ is the equilibrium constant for reaction (10). This model is based on reactions of adsorbed atomic hydrogen as suggested by the isotopic labelling techniques, and is capable of predicting the ob- served orders of reaction. As a result, both isotopic labelling and kinetic measurements support the concept that acetaldehyde hydrogenation pro- ceeds via reactions (10) and (11). The close-to-zero order dependence on acetaldehyde implies near com- plete coverage of the adsorption sites under reaction conditions. In this case, one might hope that the surface coverage under reaction conditions would 254 be sufficient to observe by infrared spectroscopy. Careful measurements were carried out using procedures identical to those which were applied successfully in the case of methyl formate hydrogenolysis [18]. The ob- served spectra could be attributed entirely to acetaldehyde and ethanol adsorption on silica. Unfortunately, peaks due to such species fall at fre- quencies similar to those expected for the copper-bound species produced in reactions (7) and (10). Consequently the sensitivity to their presence was low, and no real significance can be read into the negative finding.
