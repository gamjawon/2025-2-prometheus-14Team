The results showed that the length of the linker and the electronic properties of the P-substituent in the binuclear PCCP ligands had remarkable influence on the catalytic activity and product selectivity. The longer linker inhibits catalytic activity, and the stronger the σ-donor ability of the P-substituent is beneficial for improving catalytic activity. The Cr complex bearing ligand 4, with shorter C4 linker and stronger the σ-donor ability of P-isopropyl substituents, exhibits excellent catalytic activity of 3856 kg·g-1·h-1 and 93.1 % combined (C6 + C8) product selectivity, with 53.0 % of the product being a C8 fraction. Furthermore, the Cr complexes bearing ligands 1–5 exhibit very low PE yield. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the tetramerization path of 4/Cr is favorable compared with the trimerization path in thermodynamics, which is highly consistent with the experimental results.

Introduction Among the Linear α-olefins (LAOs), predominantly 1-hexene and 1-octene are most valuable raw materials and are used as comonomers in the production of ethylene/α-olefins copolymers. To meet demand growth for copolymers, such as linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), on-purpose technologies of selective ethylene tri-/tetramerization to produce 1-hexene and 1-octene have received extensive interest in academia and industrial communities in the last decades [1–6]. In 2003, the ethylene trimerization process was successfully commercialized by Chevron-Philips Chemical Company [7]. Next year, researchers from Sasol developed the first effective ethylene tetramerization Cr(III) catalyst based on PNP ligands, which can provide 1-octene selectivity of ∼70 wt% [8]. Subsequently, numerous studies on ethylene tetramerization have been reported, including the modification of various PNP ligands and the design of new ligands [9–13]. Recently, several carbon bridged diphosphine (PCCP) ligands were reported to catalyze selective ethylene oligomerization with satisfactory performance (Fig. 1 ) [14–20]. For PCCP ligands, the carbon bridge unsaturation, the rigidity of the backbone and the nature of substituents play an important role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [14]. Kim et al. [20] investigated the effect of P-substituents on the catalytic performance of Cr complexes bearing ethyl bridged PCCP ligands. The PCCP ligand (A, Fig. 1) with p-tolylphosphine substituent shows catalytic activity of 2256 kg·g-1 h-1 and 51.1 % 1-octene selectivity. Zhang et al. [14] reported the effect of backbone substituents of PCCP ligands (B and C, Fig. 1) on catalytic performance. The Cr complex bearing the ethyl bridged PCCP ligand (B, Fig. 1), backbone substituent of carbon-bridge is methyl, exhibits 64.7 % 1-octene selectivity. The Cr complex bearing vinyl bridged PCCP ligand (C, Fig. 1), backbone substituent of carbon-bridge is tert‑butyl, exhibits high catalytic activity of 4238 kg g-1 h-1, but the selectivity of 1-octene decreases significantly (33.1 %). Recently, our group reported the effect of different P-substituents on the catalytic performance of Cr complexes bearing phenyl bridged PCCP ligands. The Cr complex, bearing PCCP ligand with diisopropylphosphanyl substituent (D, Fig. 1), exhibits the catalytic activity of 1890 kg g-1 h-1 with 90.4 % C6 selectivity [21]. Compared with ethyl and phenyl bridged PCCP ligands (A, B and D, Fig. 1), the catalytic performance of Cr complexes bearing vinyl bridged PCCP ligands (C, Fig. 1) has dramatically attracted our attention. Introduction of a bulky substituent on the backbone of PCCP ligands with unsaturated linker is beneficial to increase the catalytic activity. However, this is at the expense of reducing the selectivity of 1-octene [14,16], the change trend of selectivity is similar to that of reported PNP/Cr catalytic system [22–24]. Moreover, multinucleation of ligand is an effective modification strategy [25]. Blann and Our group have previously reported on carbon bridged binuclear PNP systems, which exhibit comparable catalytic activity and selectivity for their analogues. Recently, Barman et al. [26] reported novel multinuclear PNP ligands bearing an N-triptycene backbone also exhibit good catalytic performance. Consequently, we hope to further explore the role of PCCP ligands in ethylene tri-/tetramerization through a multinucleation strategy. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of novel binuclear PCCP ligands 1–5 for selective ethylene tri-/tetramerization, in which two PCCP scaffolds are connected using alkyl linker with different chain lengths, and the starting position of the linker is a carbon atom of the vinyl bridge. It was found that the linker length and the electronic properties of the P-substituent significantly affected the catalytic activity and product selectivity. Upon activation with MMAO-3A, 4/Cr offer a high catalytic activity of 3856 kg·g-1·h-1 with 93.1 % combined (C6 + C8) product selectivity under 5 MPa ethylene pressure. The ethylene oligomerization performance of 4/Cr was rationalized from the reaction mechanism using DFT calculations. Experimental General comments All experimental procedures were performed in oven-dried flasks under N2 atmosphere using the standard Schlenk technique. Anhydrous solvents were dehydrated using a reflux system with sodium blocks and used immediately. All the reagents were used directly after being purchased from Aldrich. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 at 300 K by a Bruker AscendIII-400 (400 MHz for 1H, 162 MHz for 31P, and 101 MHz for 13C). Elemental analysis was performed on an Elemental Vario EL analyzer. Ligand and complex preparation: general procedure Ligand 1 was prepared by the methods we have reported [16]. To a solution of 1,7-octadiyne in diethyl ether at −78 ℃ was add n-butyllithium and continuously stirred for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the chlorodiphenylphosphane was slowly added to the above reaction mixture and continuously stirred for 5 h to get the 1,8-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)-1,7-octadiyne intermediate after filtration and distillation. To a solution of 1,8-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)-1,7-octadiyne in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was add diphenylphosphane in the presence of copper(I) iodide and cesium carbonate as catalysts and heated the reaction mixture up to 90 ℃ continuously stirred for 5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the DMF was removed by distillation. The residue was washed with n-hexane and filtered. Ligand 1 was obtained by removing n-hexane from the filtrate using a vacuum. Ligands 2–5 were also prepared using a method similar to 1 (Scheme 1 ). Ethylene oligomerization Ethylene oligomerization was carried out in a stainless-steel autoclave reactor with mechanical stirring and temperature probe. The solvent, cocatalyst, ligand and CrCl3(THF)3 was injected into the autoclave reactor with N2 as the protective gas. The reactor was pressurized with ethylene, and the reaction was allowed to run for 30 min. After the reaction, the autoclave reactor was cooled to 0 ℃ using ice salt bath and pressure relief. The liquid phase product was separated and filtered, and n-heptane was added as an internal standard. The product was analyzed by GC-FID (gas chromatography with flame ionization detector) using Agilent 7890A with HP-5 GC capillary column. Results and discussion To study the influence of different linker lengths and P-substituent groups on catalytic performance, the ligands 1–5 and CrCl3(THF)3 were used to catalyze ethylene oligomerization reaction under the same experimental conditions. The ethylene oligomerization results of CrCl3(THF)3 and 1–5/Cr are summarized in Table 1 . Upon activation of 500 equivalent of MMAO-3A cocatalyst, at 1.0 MPa ethylene pressure and 50 ℃ temperature, CrCl3(THF)3 offers negative ethylene oligomerization performance, exhibiting low catalytic activity and a large amount of PE (Table 1, entry 1). The 1–3/Cr, which PCCP scaffold having the same PPh2 substituent and different linker lengths, exhibit low catalytic activity, the main oligomeric products are C4 and cyclic-C6 byproducts (methylcyclopentane and methylenecyclopentane) (Table 1, entries 2–4). Interestingly, the 4/Cr bearing P-diisopropyl moiety exhibited very high catalytic activity of 54 kg g-1 h-1 and 27.9 % C8 selectivity (Table 1, entry 5). However, the 5/Cr showed less catalytic activity and no C8 fraction was obtained (Table 1, entry 6). Compared with 4/Cr, the linker of 5/Cr is switched from butyl of 4/Cr to hexyl, and the P-diisopropyl moiety remains unchanged. In binuclear PCCP ligands, the combination of one PCCP scaffold and linker is a substituent of the other PCCP scaffold, which plays a role in steric and electronic effects. The steric properties of single PCCP scaffold can be flexibly tuned by utilizing the length of the linker. The long linker keeps the two PCCP scaffold of the catalyst far away, which may reduce the steric bulk of substituents on the catalyst backbone C and hinder catalytic activity [14,16]. Based on the results in Table 1, it can be found that Cr complexes bearing diisopropyl phosphine ligands 4 and 5 are more active than their PPh2 counterpart ligands 1 and 3, similar phenomena have also been observed in recent reported studies [16,17,21,27]. This difference in activity may be caused by electronic properties, the stronger the σ-donor ability is beneficial for improving catalytic activity [17]. The reaction temperature has a significant impact on the ethylene oligomerization performance of the catalyst [8,14,20,28]. To investigate the effect of temperature on the performance of Cr complexes bearing binuclear PCCP ligands, ligand 4 was selected for further testing. When other conditions are the same, the oligomerization reaction temperature changes from 15 to 90 ℃, and the reaction results are listed in Table 2 . The effect of temperature on 4/Cr is consistent with the effect of temperature on common selective ethylene oligomerization catalytic systems [16,29,30]. The results in Table 2 show that temperature has a very significant impact on the catalytic performance. The 4/Cr achieved the highest activity of 72 kg·g-1·h-1 at 30 ℃, with a C8 selectivity of 33.3 % (Table 2, entry 2). The 30 ℃ is the appropriate temperature for the catalytic activity of 4/Cr, and in addition, temperature changes will lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. A lower reaction temperature is beneficial for the selectivity of 1-octene, while increasing the reaction temperature promotes the formation of C6 fraction at the expense of 1-octene selectivity. The best C8 selectivity of 46.9 % was obtained at a low temperature of 15 ℃ (Table 2, entry 1). The catalytic activity of 4/Cr increases to its optimal level with increasing the catalyst loading (Table 3 , entries 1–3), and then further increases catalyst loading dramatically decrease the catalytic activity (Table 3, entries 4–5). Low catalyst loading may result in less formation of active species, while high catalyst loading may result in incomplete activation of the catalyst [31]. The 4/Cr exhibited the highest catalytic activity at 2.4 μmol catalyst loading (Table 3, entry 3). The effect of Al/Cr molar ratio on the catalytic performance of 4/Cr has been further studied and the results are shown in Table 4 . The results indicate that a higher Al/Cr molar ratio is beneficial for increasing catalytic activity. The best catalytic activity of 4/Cr (142 kg·g-1·h-1) was obtained at an Al/Cr molar ratio of 1700, and increasing or decreasing Al/Cr molar ratio is negative for catalytic activity. The high Al/Cr molar ratio may promote the formation of active species and reduce the interference of toxic substances on the activation process or active species [32,33]. However, high Al/Cr molar ratio provides less C8 selectivity. This may be due to high catalytic activity leading to high product concentration in the system, which increases the formation of co-oligomers [34]. Excess cocatalyst may poison the active species [35,36]. Ethylene pressure has a significant impact on the activity and product selectivity of ethylene oligomerization catalysts [25,27]. To explore the effect of ethylene pressure on the catalytic performance, the 4/Cr and 5/Cr was tested under 5.0 MPa ethylene pressure, and the results are shown in Table 5 . The high ethylene pressure contributes to excellent catalytic activity and high C8 selectivity. The catalytic activity of 2991 kg·g-1·h-1 and C8 selectivity of 58.3% were obtained using 4/Cr in the presence of 1000 equivalent cocatalyst (Table 5, entry 1). In the presence of 1500 equivalent cocatalyst, 4/Cr exhibited the best catalytic activity of 3856 kg·g-1·h-1 and 93.1 % combined (C6+C8) selectivity, with 53.0 % of the product being a C8 fraction. 5/Cr provides a catalytic activity of 902 kg·g-1·h-1 and a C8 selectivity of 32.1 % (Table 5, entry 3), with significantly lower performance than 4/Cr (Table 5, entry 2). It is foreseeable that 5/Cr exhibits common ethylene oligomerization performance according to the results in Table 1. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the ethylene oligomerization performance of the catalyst. The complex formed by ligand 4 and Cr was selected for DFT calculation. The binuclear PCCP ligand 4 can coordinate with two Cr atoms and execute a metal ring mechanism at each Cr center to form LAO products. In the modeling process, we need to simplify the model of active species in order to facilitate the DFT calculation. The simplified active species model includes a complete ligand and a Cr center. Furthermore, with the linker as a reference, ligand 4 may have two stable conformations (Fig. 2 ). The vertical connection between the vinyl bridge of the ligand unit and the linker is defined as the A-type conformation (left, Fig. 2), while the flat connection between the vinyl bridge of the ligand unit and the linker is defined as the E-type conformation (right, Fig. 2). Use DFT to optimize the structure of two possible conformations and calculate the single point energy (Table 6 ). Compared to the E-type conformation, the A-type conformation has a lower relative Gibbs free energy (0 vs 7.6 kcal/mol) and is considered a stable conformation. Therefore, the subsequent calculation process is based on the A-type conformation. The relative Gibbs free energy profiles of the 4/Cr mediated catalytic cycle process was calculated using DFT (Fig. 3 ). The initial active specie is [{PCCP(CH2)4PCCP}Cr(CH2 CH2)]+ sextet spin state cationic specie 61 formed by coordinating with an ethylene molecule [37,38]. The second ethylene molecule coordinates with the initial active species 61 and transforms into an intermediate 62 with two coordinated ethylene molecules, slightly absorbing 0.2 kcal/mol of energy [39]. Intermediate 62 undergoes spin crossover conversion into a quartet spin state intermediate 42 (absorbs 0.9 kcal/mol energy), and the latter intermediate and the transition state are always in the quartet spin state surface. Two ethylene molecules of intermediate 42 undergo oxidative coupling to obtain chromacyclopentane intermediate 3 via TS2,3 transition state, overcoming the energy barrier of 7.2 kcal/mol. Intermediate 3 coordinates with the third ethylene molecule to transform into intermediate 4, and three possible parallel reaction pathways appear. For path 1, intermediate 4 is directly inserted into chromacyclopentane through ethylene and converted into chromacycloheptane intermediate 5 via TS4,5 transition state (overcoming 7.3 kcal/mol energy barrier). Intermediate 5 coordinates with the fourth ethylene molecule to obtain intermediate 6a. Intermediate 6a forms a more stable intermediate 6b through conformational relaxation. The fourth ethylene molecule inserts chromacycloheptane to form chromacyclononane intermediate 7 via TS6,7 transition state (overcoming the 10.7 kcal/mol energy barrier). The 3,9-H transfer occurs in the Cr metal ring of intermediate 7 to release 1-octene product (overcoming the energy barrier of 12.1 kcal/mol). For path 2, the intermediate 4 coordinates with the fourth ethylene molecule to form the intermediate 5′, and then one of the ethylene molecules is inserted to form the intermediate 6a via TS5′,6 transition state (overcoming the 17.6 kcal/mol barrier), and the subsequent reaction process is consistent with path 1. For path 3, intermediate 5 directly undergoes 3,7-H transfer to release 1-hexene product (overcoming the energy barrier of 16.5 kcal/mol). The energy barriers for the rate-determining steps of tetramerization paths 1, 2 and trimerization path 3 are listed in Table 7 . Compared with paths 2 and 3, path 1 shows a low energy barrier, which indicates that tetramerization path 1 is a thermodynamically favorable path. The 4/Cr mediated ethylene oligomerization process will generate more 1-octene, which is consistent with the experimental results of ethylene oligomerization (Table 5). Conclusions We have reported a series of novel binuclear PCCP ligands that can effectively catalyze selective ethylene tri-/tetramerization reaction in combination with chromium. The results indicate that the length of the linker and the electronic properties of the P-substituent play an important role in catalytic performance. Shorter linker may increase the steric bulk on the carbon bridge, promoting catalytic activity. The stronger the σ-donor ability of P-substituents is beneficial for improving catalytic activity. Under optimized reaction conditions, the 4/Cr with short linker and electron-rich P-isopropyl substituents exhibited a high catalytic activity of 3856 kg·g-1·h-1 and 93.1 % combined (C6 + C8) product selectivity, with 53.0 % of the product being a C8 fraction. In addition, all Cr complexes bearing ligands 1–5 produced very low levels of PE. The study of binuclear PCCP ligands is beneficial for further understanding the impact of structural changes in PCCP ligands on ethylene oligomerization performance. The DFT calculation results reveal that the ethylene tetramerization path of 4/Cr is thermodynamically advantageous, which is consistent with the ethylene oligomerization test results.

        "dc:description": "Several novel binuclear PCCP ligands have been synthesized and characterized, and two PCCP scaffolds are connected using length adjustable alkyl linker. The results showed that the length of the linker and the electronic properties of the P-substituent in the binuclear PCCP ligands had remarkable influence on the catalytic activity and product selectivity. The longer linker inhibits catalytic activity, and the stronger the σ-donor ability of the P-substituent is beneficial for improving catalytic activity. The Cr complex bearing ligand 4, with shorter C4 linker and stronger the σ-donor ability of P-isopropyl substituents, exhibits excellent catalytic activity of 3856 kg·g-1·h-1 and 93.1 % combined (C6 + C8) product selectivity, with 53.0 % of the product being a C8 fraction. Furthermore, the Cr complexes bearing ligands 1–5 exhibit very low PE yield. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the tetramerization path of 4/Cr is favorable compared with the trimerization path in thermodynamics, which is highly consistent with the experimental results.",
