Graphical abstract Inspired by molybdoenzymes, herein, we successfully endow Mo single-atom catalyst with highly ORR catalytic activity though engineering the coordination environment. With a half filled d-electron shell, molybdenum (Mo) plays an important role as catalysts in the petrochemical industry. However, Mo is generally regarded as not catalytically active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with other transition metals such as Fe and Co. Inspired by molybdoenzymes, herein, we successfully endow Mo single-atom catalyst with highly ORR catalytic activity though engineering the coordination environment. This unique Mo single-atom catalyst consists of oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordinated central Mo atom anchored on porous carbon (Mo-O/N-C), showing prominent ORR catalytic performance compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C under alkaline condition. The extraordinary performance of Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst is also demonstrated in Zn-air batteries as an air cathode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordination could tailor the d-band center of Mo, subsequently optimizing its binding capability with reaction intermediates (O*, OH* and OOH*), hence accelerating overall ORR process. This work not only provides an efficient and commercially competitive ORR catalyst, but advancing further development of other electrocatalysts through engineering the coordination environment. Keywords Single-atom catalyst D-band center Reaction barrier DFT calculations Zn-air battery 1 Introduction Converting chemical energy into electrical power, fuel cells [1] and metal-air batteries [2] are promising clean energy conversion technologies to address energy and environmental issues [3]. Unfortunately, the commercialization of these technologies has so far been hampered by the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode [4–6]. Despite the fact that platinum and its alloys are known as the most efficient electrocatalysts for ORR [7–9], the exorbitant cost [10], insufficient durability [11] and toxic effects [12] (e.g. CO or methanol poisoning) significantly impede their practical industrial application as well as their corresponding economic benefit [13]. To this end, exploring poisoning-resistant and durable electrocatalysts with earth-abundant elements for ORR is of paramount importance. Molybdenum is widely used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry [14]. The most important usage of molybdenum catalysts is in the hydrodesulfurisation (HDS) of petroleum, petrochemicals and coal-derived liquids [15,16]. Besides, molybdenum catalysts can catalyze conversion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to alcohols in the presence of sulfur, which would poison noble metal catalysts under the same conditions [17]. However, molybdenum catalysts are rarely used for ORR, because the energy level of the Mo d band is unfavorable for ORR and the bottleneck lies in lack of suitable coordination environment. The ORR catalytic activity of electrocatalysts, which involves the activation of O2 and the adsorption of reaction intermediates participating in the catalytic reaction, correlates with their geometric and electronic structures [18,19]. Specifically, the adsorption strength of oxygen-bearing intermediates (O*, OH* and OOH*) depends on the location of the d-band center for transition metal [20,21]. With a half filled d-electron shell, the valence state of Mo is variable, which makes it possible to maneuver the electronic structure of Mo by coordinating with different electronegative elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, etc. Therefore, molybdenum metal atoms may be moderated to the highly active electrocatalytic sites for ORR as long as the d-band center of Mo is tailored to a reasonable position. In nature, molybdoenzymes shed light on approach of the delicate modulation of the electronic structure of the active metal center. For example, the molybdenum cofactor in the assimilatory nitrate reductases is coordinated with O and S atoms, which could reduce nitrate (NO3 −) to nitrite (NO2 −) [22]. The molybdenum nitrogenase could catalyze reduction of nitrogen to ammonia under mild conditions, where the central Mo metal is coordinated with N, O and S atoms [23,24]. The unique Mo cofactors enlighten us to build biomimetic electrocatalyst utilized in ORR process. Motivated by these considerations, herein we designed a novel bio-inspired ORR electrocatalyst that consists of atomically dispersed Mo coordinated with oxygen and nitrogen dual-component on porous carbon (Mo-O/N-C) via pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with post-treatments. The atomic dispersion Mo atoms were confirmed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that Mo atoms were isolated by oxygen and nitrogen, forming Mo-O and Mo-N bonds. This unique Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst demonstrates prominent ORR catalytic capability under alkaline conditions, which was even better than commercial Pt/C. Impressively, when used to assemble the air electrode of the primary Zn-air battery, this Mo-O/N-C showed a high peak power density of 189 mW cm−2, holding great potential in practical applicability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed the oxygen and nitrogen dual-coordination could shifted down the position of Mo d-band center, which facilitated the rate-limiting reductive release of OH*, thus accelerating overall ORR process. 2 Results and discussion The overall synthesis route to prepare Mo single-atom catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1 . A polyoxometalate-based metal-organic frameworks (POMOFs) consisting of Mo ion and trimesic acid (BTC) linkers was used as a precursor. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed an octahedral morphology of as-prepared POMOFs particles (Fig. 2 a and b). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-synthesized POMOFs matched well with that of simulated POMOFs (Fig. S1). After pyrolysis in N2 atmosphere, ultrasmall copper and MoO3 nanoparticles uniformly embedded in porous carbon frameworks were obtained owing to the in situ decomposition of Mo-O clusters and BTC ligands in precursor (Fig. S2a). Through stepwise removing of the metallic copper nanoparticles with 3 M hydrochloric acid and subsequent MoO3 nanoparticles with ammonia solution, hollow octahedron frameworks were obtained (Fig. S2b). The corresponding XRD pattern further confirmed the stepwise remove of copper and MoO3 nanoparticles within the mesoporous carbon framework (Fig. S3). Thereafter, atomically dispersed Mo atoms bonded to O and N atoms in porous carbon frameworks (named as Mo-O/N-C) were finally prepared by further annealing under NH3 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 2c, the SEM image suggested the final Mo-O/N-C well maintained the morphology of the precursor. The Mo-O/N-C is porous, with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 748.78 m2/g (Fig. S4). The porosity was confirmed by means of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 2d). Neither nanoparticles nor clusters were observed in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2e), agreeing with the XRD result (Fig. S5). The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image with bright dots indicated with red circles confirmed the uniform dispersion of single Mo atoms within the Mo-O/N-C nanoparticles (Fig. 2f) [25]. The Mo content in Mo-O/N-C was 0.4 wt%, according to the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. The energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) elemental mapping images indicated the uniform distribution of C, N, O and Mo elements throughout the entire octahedron, suggesting Mo was co-coordinated with oxygen and nitrogen (Fig. 2g). To understand the structure of Mo-O/N-C at atomic level, we performed synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) curves of Mo-K edge revealed the position of Mo-O/N-C located between Mo foil and MoO2, suggesting the chemical valence of Mo in Mo-O/N-C is between the two references. The Fourier transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Fig. 3b) of Mo-O/N-C possessed only one sharp peak, different from that of Mo foil with scattering peaks derived from Mo-Mo coordination. This phenomenon indicated Mo atoms are isolated from each other in the Mo-O/N-C without Mo clusters or metallic Mo [26], in agreement with the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM result. Synchrotron soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were also performed to further investigate the structure of Mo-O/N-C. The carbon K-edge XANES spectra of Mo-O/N-C, with graphene oxide (G-O) and graphene oxide after nitrogen doping (G-O/N) as references were presented in Fig. 3c. The peak A was attributed to the π* excitation of C-C bonds in a C ring structure, the peak B originated from C-O bonds and the peak C was assigned to σ* excitation of C-C bonds [27,28]. The higher peak intensity of Mo-O/N-C at 288.3 eV than G-O and G-O/N could be attributed to coordination of oxygen to metal, indicating that the majority of carbon is present as C-O-Mo [29,30]. The successful N incorporation was revealed by the N K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3d), showing three π* resonances assigned to sp2 hybridized pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N [31]. Moreover, an obvious shoulder ascribed to metal-N for Mo-O/N-C between pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen presented, indicating successful bonding of metal Mo atom and N [32]. The oxygen K-edge XANES spectra of Mo-O/N-C, G-O and MoO3/C were displayed in Fig. S6. Compared with G-O, Mo-O/N-C and MoO3/C showed Mo-O peaks. Moreover, the Mo-O peak of Mo-O/N-C showed an obvious red shift compared with that of MoO3/C, suggesting the lower valence state of Mo in Mo-O/N-C, which was in good agreement with EXAFS result of Mo K-edge [33]. Furthermore, FTIR was also performed to confirm the C-O and C-N bonds (Fig. S7). And according to the XPS results (Table S1), the O and N contents in Mo-O/N-C were 2.43 atomic % and 5.8 atomic %, respectively. Based on above analysis, Mo atoms in as-prepared Mo-O/N-C sample are isolated from each other and bonded to N and O atoms within the porous carbon frameworks. The ORR catalytic activity of Mo-O/N-C was evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 4 a, results showed an obvious oxygen reduction peak in O2-saturated electrolyte compared to N2-saturated electrolyte. Thereafter, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed to investigate electrocatalytic activity and kinetics with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and G-O/N as references (Fig. 4b). Compared with G-O/N, Mo-O/N-C exhibited prominent performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.850 V, which was even better than commercial 20 wt% of Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.840 V) and comparable to that of the most efficient non-precious catalysts reported so far (Table S2). Moreover, the smallest Tafel slope of Mo-O/N-C suggested Mo-O/N-C had the fastest ORR kinetics (Fig. S8). These results revealed that the Mo-OxNy moieties played an irreplaceable role in facilitating ORR catalytic activity. To investigate the electron transfer ability of Mo-O/N-C, an RDE experiment was carried out at different rotating speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm according Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation(Fig. 4c). The linearity of the K-L plots for Mo-O/N-C (Fig. S9) demonstrated a first order O2 dependent reaction kinetics and potential independent electron transfer rate. The calculated results revealed the transfer number was 3.99 over the tested potential range. Besides, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests were further conducted to investigate the electron transfer mechanism and H2O2 yields (Fig. 4d). The H2O2 yield of Mo-O/N-C remained below 3% at all potentials and the electron-transfer number was also close to 4, suggesting a direct four-electron pathway reduction reaction. Next, the stability and durability of Mo-O/N-C were also studied. As displayed in Fig. 4e, the Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding stability with negligible change even after 5000 continuous cycles. And the octahedral morphology and structure of Mo-O/N-C were well preserved even after 5000 cycles (Fig. S10), indicating the superb structure stability of Mo-O/N-C. Moreover, the chronoamperometric test (Fig. S11) revealed better durability of Mo-O/N-C compared to 20 wt% Pt/C. To evaluate the fuel crossover effect, the chronoamperometric response of Mo-O/N-C and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C to methanol introduced into the O2-saturated electrolyte was further carried out. The ORR current of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C decreased sharply after the injection of methanol at the time of 400 s (Fig. 4f). In contrast, there was no obvious change of the ORR current for Mo-O/N-C, suggesting it had excellent tolerance to methanol poisoning. Motivated by the high ORR activity and durability, we further evaluated its practical energy conversion application by assembling it into a primary Zn-air battery device (Fig. 4g). As depicted in Fig. 4h, the Mo-O/N-C exhibited a peak power density of 189 mW cm−2, which was higher than that of commercial Pt/C and G-O/N. The galvanostatic discharge curves (Fig. 4i) display that the Mo-O/N-C possesses a higher voltage of 1.26 V at current densities of 20 mA cm−2 compared with that of commercial Pt/C and G-O/N. Moreover, Mo-O/N-C cathode showed excellent stability with a negligible change even for 22,000 s at 20 mA cm−2. Multiple Zn-air batteries connected in series can be manufactured and integrated into circuits to meet specific energy/powerrequirements for a variety of applications. One proof-of-concept illustration was to power a light-emitting diode (LED) panel displaying “USTC”. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to understand the active site structures and the origin of the ORR activity of Mo-O/N-C. Owing to the variable valence state of Mo, Bader charge analyses were performed for Mo atoms in different Mo-OxNx coordination environments including Mo-O1N3, Mo-O2N2 and Mo-O3N1 moieties [34]. For comparison, Mo2N and MoO2 bulks were also calculated, in which the chemical valence of Mo is generally considered to be Mo1.5+ and Mo4+. As shown in Fig. S12, result suggested the charges of Mo in three established models are within the range of Mo1.5+ and Mo4+, which is consistent with the former XANES result. Moreover, only Mo-O1N3 and Mo-O2N2 moieties were considered in the following theoretical calculations as Mo-O3N1 moiety was unstable after OOH* adsorption (Fig. S13). According to previous DFT calculations, the C atoms adjacent to N in N-doped carbon electrocatalysts were preferred binding sites for ORR intermediates owing to doping-induced charge redistribution [35]. Thus, in our case, both Mo and C in Mo-O1N3 and Mo-O2N2 moieties were considered as possible active absorption sites. Results indicated that the reaction pathways of both models follows a dual-site mechanism, where O* was favorably adsorbed on the C site, while the OOH* and OH* preferred to reside at the Mo atom, which is consistent with previous DFT calculations [36]. The calculated energy diagrams indicated that desorption of OH* in last step is the rate-determining step (RDS). As shown in Fig. 5 and S14, the RDS of Mo-O2N2 moiety only needs to overcome a limiting barrier (ΔGOH*) of 1.36 eV compared to Mo-O1N3 moiety with a value as large as 1.45 eV. Computational screening identified that Mo-O2N2 moiety had an appropriate binding strength with the ORR species and could be potential high active ORR site. The electronic structures of the Mo atoms with different coordination environment were further calculations. The charge density difference diagram of Mo-O2N2 moiety (Fig. S15) clearly showed the electron transfer from Mo atom to the nearby O and N atoms, which tailored the d-band center of Mo. The density of states (DOS) was calculated and the d-band center of Mo was estimated to be −2.36 eV and −2.29 eV for Mo-O2N2 and Mo-O1N3 moieties, respectively (Table S4). The projected density of states (pDOS) showed the hybridization of d orbital from Mo atom and p orbital of O atom in OH* generates bonding and antibonding states (Fig. S16). The bonding states are occupied as they are under the Fermi level, while the extent of filling of the antibonding states depends on these energy states relative to the Fermi level [37], as illustrated in Fig. S17. Compared with Mo-O1N3 moiety, the position of d-band center for Mo-O2N2 moiety shifted down, leading a downward shift of the antibonding state, which facilitated the rate-limiting reductive release of OH*, thus favoring the ORR performance. The calculated results suggested changing local geometry of the nearest coordinated atoms provided a means of tailoring the d-band center such that the overpotential of the ORR could be minimized. 3 Conclusion In conclusion, we successfully endowed Mo single atom catalyst with prominent ORR catalytic capability through oxygen and nitrogen dual-coordination via learning from nature. Coordinating Mo with O and N atoms could shift down the position of its d-band center and decrease its binding strength with OH*. Therefore, this bio-inspired Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst achieved enhanced activity for ORR and zinc-air batteries compared to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C as well as exceptional durability during cycling in alkaline medium. This work opens up a new strategy to rationally design efficient ORR electrocatalysts through engineering the nearest coordination environment.

        "dc:description": "With a half filled d-electron shell, molybdenum (Mo) plays an important role as catalysts in the petrochemical industry. However, Mo is generally regarded as not catalytically active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with other transition metals such as Fe and Co. Inspired by molybdoenzymes, herein, we successfully endow Mo single-atom catalyst with highly ORR catalytic activity though engineering the coordination environment. This unique Mo single-atom catalyst consists of oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordinated central Mo atom anchored on porous carbon (Mo-O/N-C), showing prominent ORR catalytic performance compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C under alkaline condition. The extraordinary performance of Mo-O/N-C electrocatalyst is also demonstrated in Zn-air batteries as an air cathode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the oxygen and nitrogen dual-component coordination could tailor the d-band center of Mo, subsequently optimizing its binding capability with reaction intermediates (O*, OH* and OOH*), hence accelerating overall ORR process. This work not only provides an efficient and commercially competitive ORR catalyst, but advancing further development of other electrocatalysts through engineering the coordination environment.",
