Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer a promising approach for maximizing noble metals utilization in catalytic processes. However, their performance in CO2 hydrogenation is often constrained by the nature of metal-support interactions. In this study, we synthesized TiO2 supported Pt SACs (Pt1/TiO2), with Pt single atoms dispersed on rutile (Pt1/R) and anatase (Pt1/A) phases of TiO2 for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. While both catalysts maintained 100% CO selectivity over time, Pt1/A achieved a CO2 conversion of 7.5%, significantly outperforming Pt1/R (3.6%). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed distinct reaction pathways: the COOH pathway was dominant on Pt1/A, whereas the –OH + HCO pathway was more competitive on Pt1/R. Analysis of electron metal-support interactions and energy barrier calculations indicated that Pt1/A better stabilized metallic Pt species and facilitates more favorable reaction pathways with lower energy barriers. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient SAC systems in CO2 hydrogenation processes. Graphical Abstract Schematic of Pt SACs on rutile (Pt1/R) and anatase (Pt1/A) TiO2 for RWGS. Pt1/A exhibits higher CO2 conversion via the COOH pathway, while Pt1/R follows the –OH + HCO pathway, influenced by electron metal-support interactions. Keywords Single-atom catalyst CO2 hydrogenation Electron metal-support interactions Catalytic activity Reaction pathways 1 Introduction The rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), driven by industrial activities and the consumption of fossil fuels, is a major contributor to climate change [1]. To address this urgent issue, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels has emerged as a promising strategy for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) [2,3]. This process not only helps in reducing CO2 emissions but also provides a sustainable source of carbon-based products, thereby contributing to a circular carbon economy. Among various CO2 conversion processes, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which converts CO2 and hydrogen (H2) into carbon monoxide (CO) and water, has garnered significant attention [4]. The RWGS reaction holds particular promise due to its dual role in mitigating climate change and advancing sustainable chemical manufacturing. The CO product from RWGS can serve as a crucial feedstock in processes like the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol production, making it a key component in CO2 utilization strategies [5–7]. Furthermore, the RWGS process provides a pathway to store renewable energy in chemical bonds, addressing the intermittency issues associated with renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Insights from RWGS research can also be applied to other CO2 conversion technologies, amplifying the potential impact of advancements in this area [8]. However, achieving high CO2 conversion rates in RWGS typically requires high reaction temperatures, which can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering, carbon deposition, or the formation of unwanted by-products like methane [9]. Therefore, understanding the underlying reaction mechanisms and designing efficient catalysts with high selectivity toward CO production are crucial for the economic and practical viability of the RWGS process [10]. The RWGS mechanism can proceed via different pathways depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, involving either a redox or associative pathway. In the redox pathway, the catalyst undergoes alternate reduction and oxidation cycles, facilitating the RWGS reaction. In the associative pathway, both CO2 and H2 adsorb onto the catalyst surface and react via intermediate species, such as a HCO or a COOH. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), particularly Pt single-atom catalysts, have emerged as highly efficient and selective catalysts for the RWGS reaction due to their unique structural and electronic properties [11,12]. However, despite these advantages, SACs often suffer from challenges such as poor stability under reaction conditions, as single metal atoms tend to migrate and agglomerate into larger particles, which reduces their catalytic efficiency [13]. Additionally, the reactivity and selectivity of SACs can be highly dependent on the metal-support interactions, making it essential to choose an appropriate support that can not only stabilize the single metal atoms but also enhance their catalytic properties. To address these challenges, supports such as TiO2, CeO2, or Al2O3 have been widely used due to their strong metal-support interactions, which help stabilize the single metal atoms and suppress undesirable side reactions [14,15]. Among these supports, TiO2 stands out due to its high thermal stability, ability to modulate electronic properties, and the strong metal-support interactions it facilitates [11,16]. In particular, the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 exhibit distinct catalytic properties, with anatase often stabilizing metal species more effectively, while rutile promotes different reaction pathways [17]. Despite these promising characteristics, a detailed understanding of how these crystal phases influence the catalytic behavior of Pt single atoms in RWGS remains limited. In this study, Pt SACs were synthesized by uniformly dispersing Pt atoms on different crystal phases of TiO2 (rutile and anatase). The catalytic performance of both Pt SA/TiO2 catalysts was evaluated under a RWGS reaction condition at 350 °C. In-depth in situ studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to directly correlate the reaction intermediates and energy barriers with the electronic states of Pt on different TiO2 phases. Our findings reveal that Pt single atoms on anatase TiO2 exhibit enhanced catalytic performance compared to rutile, primarily due to more favorable reaction pathways and lower energy barriers for CO2 activation. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of how crystal phase in TiO2 influences SAC performance, offering new insights for designing more efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation and RWGS reactions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of fresh Pt1/TiO2 catalysts A Pt solution was prepared by dissolving 492.9 mg of H2PtCl6·(H2O)6 in 50 mL of deionized (DI) water. Then, 0.17 mL of this solution was added to 50 mL of DI water which was heated to 70 °C in an oil bath and left there for 30 min to reach thermal equilibrium. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 by adding NaOH dropwise (0.1 mol·L–1). Next, 400 mg of TiO2 (e.g., anatase and rutile) was dispersed in 10 mL of DI water and added to the Pt precursor solution. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 7 by adding NaOH solution, and the solution was maintained at 70 °C for an additional 3 h. The particles were separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 15 min, and the collected particles were subsequently redispersed in DI water for washing to remove Cl− and Na+ ions. The washed particles were then placed in a vacuum desiccator and dried for 24 h. The resulting dried powder was ground into a fine powder and were calcined at 150 °C (5 °C·min–1 ramping) for 1h, denoted as fresh Pt1/A and fresh Pt1/R, according to the type of TiO2 used (commercial anatase or rutile, respectively). 2.2 Catalytic activity evaluation The catalytic activity of Pt1/TiO2 for RWGS was tested using a fixed-bed flow reactor in a quartz tube, with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 100 L·g–1·h–1. The reaction gas mixture, comprising 80% H2 and 20% CO2, was fed at a rate of 100 mL·min–1. The catalyst was heated at a rate of 5 °C·min–1 to the desired reaction temperature (350 °C) and held for 60 min to reach a steady state. The samples subjected to reactions at 350 °C for 1 h are denoted as Pt1/TiO2-1h. The compositions of the effluent gases were determined using online gas analyzers (Caldos27, Uras26, and Magnos208, EL3020 series, ABB) at a constant sampling frequency of 1 Hz. CO2 conversion (C) and CO selectivity (S) were calculated using following equations: (1) C CO 2 = V CO, out + V CH4, out V CO 2 , in × 100 % (2) S CO = V CO, out V CH 4 , out + V CO, out × 100 % where V CO, out is the CO volume percentage in the outlet gas mixture. V CH4, out is the CH4 volume percentage in the outlet gas mixture. V CO2, in is the CO2 volume percentage in the feed gas mixture. 2.3 Characterizations The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB250Xi, USA) with Al K alpha source, 500 mm spot size, under standard lens mode. Fresh catalysts were analyzed at reaction temperature (350 °C) under the reaction gas mixture, comprising 80% H2 and 20% CO2 to obtain the in situ XPS spectra. The likely charge of samples was corrected by setting the C 1s binding energy of the adventitious carbon to 284.8 eV. The crystalline of the samples was examined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD, 40 kV, 40 mA using a Cu K radiation source, Bruker Corporation, Basel, Switzerland). The morphologies of catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200). CO-temperature programmed desorption (CO-TPD) experiments were conducted using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 instrument, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Initially, a 50 mg sample was pretreated under argon (Ar) at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. Pure CO gas was subsequently introduced at a flow rate of 20 mL·min–1 for 20 min at 30 °C, followed by heating from 30 °C to 500 °C at a linear rate of 10 °C·min–1 under a pure argon flow of 50 mL·min–1. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were conducted via a Micrometrics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. In a typical measurement, 20 mg of samples were preheated from room temperature to 150 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 and held for 30 min under Ar atmosphere (40 mL·min–1). The sample was then cooled to 50 °C. Once the baseline stabilized, the temperature was ramped up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 under a mixed gas of 10 vol% H2/Ar (40 mL·min–1). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements of CO2 hydrogenation were performed on a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Vertex FTIR). Ten milligrams of Pt/TiO2 samples were mixed with 50 mg of KBr and then loaded on the sample stage of the reaction cell. Before adsorption experiments, the samples were degassed at 150 °C with Argon under 50 mL·min–1 for 30 min and then cooled to 30 °C. Next, catalysts were heated to 350 °C at a rate of 5 °C·min–1, whose spectra were taken as the background spectra. Subsequently, reaction gas mixture, comprising 80% H2 and 20% CO2 were introduced into the cell with a flow rate of 100 mL·min–1. The time-depended DRIFT spectra of CO2 hydrogenation were recorded at the time of the reaction gas atmosphere. The spectra were recorded every 60 s to follow the reaction and stabilization of the surface species. The morphologies of catalysts were characterized by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-STEM, FEI Theims Z, Titan Cubed Themis G2300, JEM-ARM200F). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were estimated based on nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms measured at –196 °C using a Quantachrome AUTOSORB IQ surface area analyzer. The morphology of the catalysts was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200, equipped with Ultim Max 80) X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of Pt L3-edge were measured in fluorescent mode at room temperature at the XAFCA beamline of Singapore Synchrotron Light Sources (SSLS). Data were analyzed using Athena and Artemis from the Demeter software package. Pt foil was applied for energy calibration and monochromator drift correction. The processed EXAFS, χ(k), was weighted by k3 to amplify the high-k oscillations. For Fourier-transformed (FT) spectra, the k range between 3.0 to 11.0 A? was used, and the curve fitting was performed using Artemis software. 2.4 DFT calculations We carried out all the spin polarized DFT calculations in the Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP5.4.4) code. During the geometric optimization, the exchange-correlation is simulated with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, and the ion-electron interactions were described by the project augmented wave (PAW) method [18,19]. Geometry optimizations were optimized until the force on each atom was less than 0.05 eV·A?–1 with the cutoff energy of 400 eV. The strongly correlated 3d electron of Ti was implemented with DFT + U correction (U eff = 3.0 eV) [20]. Climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) methods were used to determine the transition states (TS) with the force tolerance of 0.05 eV·A?–1. Some of the TS were confirmed by the dimer method to isolate the transition state to the point where the force acting on the transition state dimer was lower than 0.05 eV·A?–1. Rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces were used as the slab with 7 atom layers (3 titanium layers) of TiO2. The slabs were separated by more than 20 A? of vacuum. Rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces of the simulations were carried out using a (4 × 2) and (3 × 4) unit cells to model CO2 hydrogenation. The atoms in the top one trilayers of the TiO2 slab were allowed to fully relax while the atoms in the bottom two trilayers of the TiO2 slab were fixed to their lattice positions for all unit cells. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Freshly Prepared Pt1/TiO2 Catalysts TiO2 (including commercial Anatase-P25 and Rutile) was loaded with 0.2 wt% of Pt. Pt single atoms (SAs) on commercial anatase and rutile were designated as fresh Pt1/A and Pt1/R, respectively. The ICP results (Table S1) showed that the Pt loading efficiency is very high, without significant changes observed between the nominal and practical values of Pt content (0.2 wt%). After loading Pt, the specific surface areas slightly decreased to 38 m2·g–1 for Pt1/A and 41 m2·g–1 for Pt1/R, compared to the bare supports, which were 47 m2·g–1 for anatase and 50 m2·g–1 for rutile, respectively. This reduction may be attributed to slight sintering during the catalyst drying process and the loading of active components. However, the specific surface areas of Pt1/A and Pt1/R remain quite similar to each other (Table S2). XRD analysis offered further insight into the structural characteristics of the catalyst. The XRD patterns of the fresh Pt1/R and Pt1/A revealed that only the pure rutile and anatase phases can be observed without any peaks of Pt (Pt (111), 2θ ≈ 40°) observed all over the scanning range (Fig. 1(a) and Table S3), further indicating the uniform dispersion of Pt on the catalyst surface. The successfully dispersion of Pt SAs on rutile and anatase supports was confirmed by AC-STEM images, XANES, EXAFS, and DRIFTS using CO as probe molecule. Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) present the AC-STEM images of the fresh Pt1/R and Pt1/A samples, with clear labeling of Pt atoms, as well as the crystallographic planes of the TiO2 supports. The images reveal a highly uniform dispersion of Pt atoms across the rutile and anatase support surfaces, consisting of Pt SAs, dual atoms, and clusters, with no evidence of agglomeration. Notably, Pt single atoms and dual atoms constitute the majority of the observed Pt species, especially Pt SAs. TEM images confirm that no Pt nanoparticles were observed on Pt1/R (Fig. S1(a) and Pt1/A (Fig. S1(b). XANES results indicated that the Pt species in fresh Pt1/R and fresh Pt1/A were in oxidized states, as shown in Fig. 1(d). EXAFS results confirmed the absence of either Pt–Pt metallic bonds or Pt–O–Pt bonds, and the exclusive presence of Pt–O and Pt–O–Ti bonds, which are characteristic of Pt single atom structures (Fig. 1(e). In the H2-TPR profiles, no Pt species reduction peaks were observed, only TiO2 reduction peaks appeared at 350 °C, indicating that the Pt species on Pt1/TiO2 catalysts remained in an oxidized state (in Fig. S2). Fig. 1(f) presents the XANES profile of the Ti K-edge for rutile and anatase, suggesting that the phase difference significantly affects the valence state of Ti atoms in TiO2. The FT-EXAFS spectra (Fig. 1(g) reveal a similar first-shell peak from the Ti–O contribution, indicating that the coordination number and bond length of TiO6 octahedra in rutile are similar to those in anatase. The chemical state of Pt SACs in Pt/TiO2 catalysts was characterized using DRIFTS with CO as a probe molecule. Two types of CO-DIRFTS signals at approximately 2085 and 1860 cm–1 were observed in (Figs. 1(h) and (i)), corresponding to CO adsorption on positively charged Pt sites and bridged CO adsorption on Pt sites on Pt1/A and Pt1/R catalysts. Further characterization via CO-TPD profiles identified two signals at 90 and 180 °C, corresponding to CO adsorption on Pt SAs (linear-CO) and Pt double atoms (bridge-CO), respectively (Fig. S3). This further supports the STEM results, demonstrating that Pt SAs and dual atoms, particularly Pt SAs, make up the majority of the loaded Pt species. In summary, we successfully synthesized Pt1/TiO2 catalysts with Pt single atoms dispersed on different TiO2 phases. 3.2 Catalytic RWGS The catalytic performance of the Pt1/R and Pt1/A catalysts for the RWGS reaction was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor at 350 °C under a GHSV of 100 L·g–1·h–1 (CO2:H2 = 1:4), as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) . The reactions were stabilized at 350 °C for at least 1 h prior to collecting the catalytic data. The samples subjected to reactions at 350 °C for 1 h are denoted as Pt1/TiO2-1h. The CO2 conversion of fresh Pt1/TiO2 for the RWGS reaction increased from 3.6% for Pt1/R to 7.5% for Pt1/A at 350 °C, as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, both Pt1/R and Pt1/A exhibit 100% CO selectivity over time-on-stream (TOS), as shown in Fig. 2(b). In conclusion, Pt single atom loaded on anatase exhibits the superior catalytic activity compared to those loaded on rutile. Fig. 2(c) presents Arrhenius plots of CO yield from CO2 conversion, demonstrating reasonable linearity across the examined temperature range. The activation energy (E a) values for CO2 conversion were calculated from the slopes, revealing that Pt1/A exhibited a lower Ea for CO formation (88.9 kJ·mol−1) compared to Pt1/R (99.7 kJ·mol−1). The catalytic activity of the prepared single-atom catalysts (e.g., Pt1/A and Pt1/R) is compared with Pt nanoparticles reported in the literature, as illustrated in Fig. 2(d) and summarized in Table S4. Fig. 2(d) and Table S4 indicate that most RWGS catalysts were tested within the medium temperature range of 300 to 400 °C, with few studies exploring temperature above 600 °C. The space time yield (STY) of Pt single-atom catalysts is generally higher than that of most oxide-supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts reported in the literature. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the higher atomic utilization efficiency of Pt single atoms during the RWGS reaction. 3.3 Discussion on the difference of intrinsic RWGS reactivity As described above, the Pt1/A and Pt1/R catalysts exhibited distinct intrinsic catalytic performances during the RWGS reaction tests, with the CO2 conversion of Pt1/A being approximately twice that of Pt1/R. To understand the underlying causes of this difference, we conducted a series of fundamental and in-situ characterizations on both catalysts. 3.3.1 BET and AC-STEM characterizations After the reaction at 350 °C, Pt1/A-1h and Pt1/R-1h demonstrate identical specific surface areas, as shown in Table S2. Pt1/TiO2 after 60 min of TOS were characterized using high-resolution AC-STEM images. The absence of Pt nanoparticles on both Pt1/R (Fig. S4(a) and Pt1/A (Fig. S4(b) confirms that Pt species remained un-sintered during the RWGS reaction. 3.3.2 Identifying reaction intermediates using in-situ DRIFT and in-situ XPS The reaction pathway over Pt1/TiO2 was investigated using in situ DRIFTS during 30 min of TOS at 350 °C in Figs. S5, S6. COOH bands were observed on both Pt1/R and Pt1/A (Fig. 3(a) at 1645 cm−1 ν(OCO)asym, 1426 cm−1 ν(OCO)sym, 1240 cm−1 ν(COH), respectively [24]. The band at 1517 cm−1 is assigned to a carbonate species [3]. Additionally, HCO and –OH bands were observed on Pt1/R at 2922 and 3395 cm−1, respectively [25]. In contrast, no HCO and –OH bands were detected on Pt1/A. The appearance of HCO and –OH bands suggests that the reaction pathway of RWGS reaction on Pt1/R differs from that on Pt1/A. COOH pathway dominates on Pt1/A, while the format pathway competes with COOH pathway on Pt1/R during the RWGS reaction at 350 °C. CO adsorption on Pt single atoms (Pt SA–CO) was clearly observed at 2100 cm−1 on both Pt1/R and Pt1/A, indicating that Pt single atoms are the activity sites during the RWGS reaction [26]. The observed Pt SA–CO interaction confirms the presence of Pt SA in Pt1/TiO2 catalyst, consistent with the STEM results shown in Figs. 1(a), (b). In situ XPS spectra was employed to further elucidate the RWGS reaction mechanisms on Pt single atom supported on TiO2. Three peaks in C 1s XPS spectra were observed at 284.8, 288.4, and 289.3 eV, corresponding to C–C, adsorbed carbon species, and COOH species, respectively [22,27]. COOH species were detected on both Pt1/R (Fig. 3(b) and Pt1/A (Fig. 3(c) using the in-situ C 1s XPS spectra. In contrast, adsorbed carbon species rather than COOH species, were observed on both Pt1/R (Fig. 3(b) and Pt1/A (Fig. 3(c) through the ex-situ C 1s XPS spectra. The formation of COOH species was confirmed by both in situ DRIFTS and in situ C 1s XPS spectra on Pt1/TiO2 catalysts during RWGS TOS. Additionally, in situ O 1s XPS was employed to investigate the oxygen species on rutile (Fig. 3(d) and anatase (Fig. 3(e) supports. Two peaks were observed at 530.4 and 531.3 eV for Pt1/R (Fig. 3(d) and Pt1/A in (Fig. 3(e), corresponding to lattice oxygen (Ol) and surface hydroxyl groups (–OH), respectively [28,29]. In the ex situ O 1s XPS spectra, the surface –OH:Ol ratio of Pt1/R (12%) is similar to that of Pt1/A (11%). In the in situ O 1s XPS spectra, the surface –OH:Ol ratio of Pt1/R (36%) is significantly higher than to that of Pt1/A (12%). The formation of surface –OH on Pt1/R over RWGS TOS, consistent with the in situ DRIFTS results in Fig. 3(a). 3.3.3 DFT calculations DFT calculations are employed to rationalize the observed trend in catalytic activity with Pt single atom load on the anatase and rutile. Accordingly, a simplified slab model consisting of an Pt single atom supported on rutile (110) surface (denoted as Pt1/R) and anatase (101) surface (denoted as Pt1/A), as shown in Figs. S8 and S9, is used to simulate the catalytic interface of Pt1/TiO2. The choice of rutile (110) surface and anatase (101) surface are based on the high-resolution AC-TEM observation that (110) and (101) are the dominating surface facet for the Pt1/TiO2 catalysts, as shown in Figs. 1(a), (b). The binding energy of the supported Pt single atom is calculated by: (3) E bind = E slab – E Pt1 – E TiO2 where E slab, E Pt1 and E TiO2 are the total energy of the entire system (e.g., Pt1/TiO2 in Figs. S8, S9, Pt1 and the rutile slab from the corresponding relaxed model, respectively, calculated using VASP and provided in Table S4.) Here, E bind represents the degree of stabilization of the Pt1/TiO2 configuration [30]. Therefore, a more negative E bind means a more stable structure. Herein, the most stable structure of Pt1/R and Pt1/A should be chosen for further modelling analysis, as shown in Figs. S8(c)–S78 and Figs. S9(c), (d), respectively. The Pt 4f XPS spectra, presented in Figs. 4(a), (b) , display two distinct Pt 4f XPS peaks on both Pt1/R (Fig. 4(a) and Pt1/A (Fig. 4(b). These peaks at 71.2, 73.5, and 75 eV corresponding to monovalence Pt (Pt+), bivalent Pt species (Pt2+), quadrivalent Pt species (Pt4+), respectively [4,15,31]. The Pt single atoms on rutile were fully oxidized due to the absence of metallic Pt species, while those on anatase were partially oxidized. In situ Pt 4f XPS spectra were further employed to investigate the electron transfer between Pt SA and TiO2 during the RWGS reaction. The ratio of Pt+ to Pt2+ increased from 0.1 in the ex-situ Pt 4f XPS to 1.2 in the in-situ Pt 4f XPS, indicating electron transfer from anatase to Pt SA in Pt1/A during RWGS reaction. Conversely, the ratio of Pt2+ to Pt4+ decreased from 1.1 in the ex-situ Pt 4f XPS to 0.8 in the in-situ Pt 4f XPS, suggesting electron transfer from Pt SA to rutile in Pt1/R during RWGS reaction. The charge density difference plots for various Pt1/TiO2 models (Fig. 4(c) clearly show charge transfer when a Pt single atom is loaded on rutile (110) and anatase (101). The Pt single atoms were partially covered on rutile, whereas they were fully covered on anatase. Next, Bader charge analysis was performed on the Pt1/TiO2 interface. The Bader charges for the various O, Ti, and Pt atoms are provided in Supporting information, respectively. Overall, a Pt SA on rutile (110) surface contains fewer electrons (0.07) compared to one on anatase (111) surface. Therefore, Pt1/A is more favorable for maintaining lower positive Pt species. This finding is consistent with the in situ Pt 4f XPS results. 3.4 Potential reaction mechanisms of RWGS reaction over Pt1/A and Pt1/R The in-situ characterization results under reaction conditions, along with DFT calculations for constructing the catalyst reaction model, contribute to our understanding of the RWGS reaction process and enable deeper exploration of its mechanism. To elucidate the observed COOH bands from in situ DRIFTS, we investigated the COOH reaction pathway using the climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method, determining the transition states (TS) involved in CO2 hydrogenation. The study focused on two Pt1/TiO2 model structures, denoted as Pt1/A (anatase) and Pt1/R (rutile), to explore their catalytic behaviors. 3.4.1 COOH and –OH + HCO reaction pathways Initially, CO2 and H2 were co-adsorbed on Pt1/A in Fig. 5(a) and Pt1/R in Fig. 5(b). The adsorption on Pt1/A was exothermic by 0.41 eV, while on Pt1/R, it was more exothermic by 2.08 eV (denoted as CO2*/H2* in Fig. 5(a), indicating stronger adsorption on the rutile phase (in Fig. 5(b). The subsequent reaction of CO2 with H2 on Pt1/A and Pt1/R led to the formation of trans-COOH intermediates in Figs. 5(a), (b), with energy barriers of 0.26 and 0.79 eV, respectively. The trans-COOH further converted to cis-COOH, with energy barriers of 0.41 eV on Pt1/A and 0 eV on Pt1/R in Fig. 5(c). The DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 3(a) confirmed the presence of COOH structures, consistent with the calculated intermediates. On Pt1/A, a unique intermediate was produced following the disconnection of the O–Ti bond in Fig. 5(a), as evidenced by a distinct DRIFTS peak at 1645 cm–1 in Fig. 3(a). This intermediate reacted with a residual hydrogen atom to produce CO and H2O in Fig. 5(a), with an energy barrier of 0.84 eV. In contrast, on Pt1/R, the cis-COOH directly reacted with residual hydrogen to form CO and H2O in Fig. 5(b), but with a significantly higher energy barrier of 1.79 eV in Fig. 5(c). The presence of –OH groups, as detected in the DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 3(a), was also explored. The transition state from trans–COOH to –OH on Pt1/R had an energy barrier of only 0.85 eV, which is much lower than the 1.79 eV required for the formation of CO and H2O in Fig. 5(c). This suggests that on Pt1/R, the COOH species preferentially undergoes a reaction pathway leading to –OH formation rather than CO and H2O production. Consequently, Pt1/A is more effective for catalyzing the RWGS reaction compared to Pt1/R, as the pathway through COOH intermediates is more favorable. 3.4.2 Redox reaction pathway Another possible reaction pathway was explored, involving the redox process during CO2 and H2 adsorption on Pt1/TiO2. In this pathway, the adsorption of CO2 and H2 on Pt1/A and Pt1/R was exothermic by 0.41 and 2.08 eV, respectively, as indicated by the CO2*/H2* step in Fig. 5(d). The subsequent reduction of CO2 by adsorbed H2 required energy barriers of 0.32 eV on Pt1/A and 1.02 eV on Pt1/R in Fig. 5(d). The differences in transition states between the two structures account for the disparity in energy barriers. On Pt1/A, the transition state involved the activation of CO2 at the Pt single atom site, as illustrated in Fig. 5(d). Conversely, on Pt1/R, oxygen from the rutile (110) surface participated in the activation of CO2, resulting in a significantly higher energy barrier. This observation aligns with the experimental results (Fig. 2(a), where Pt1/R exhibited lower catalytic activity for the RWGS reaction compared to Pt1/A. The DFT calculations reveal that the phase of the TiO2 support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity of Pt1/TiO2 for the RWGS reaction. The anatase phase (Pt1/A) provides a lower energy barrier and more favorable pathways through COOH intermediates and direct redox, making it superior to the rutile phase (Pt1/R) for this reaction. The results highlight the importance of support structure in optimizing catalyst performance for CO2 hydrogenation. 4 Conclusions In this study, we elucidate that the crystal phase of TiO2 support plays a critical role in determining the catalytic performance of Pt1/TiO2 for the RWGS reaction. Our findings reveal that Pt1/A (anatase) significantly outperforms Pt1/R (rutile), primary due to its ability to maintain metallic Pt species and promote more efficient catalytic pathways. Notably, Pt1/A exhibits a lower energy barrier for the formation of COOH intermediates and more favorable redox processes, leading to an enhanced CO2 conversion rate. In contrast, Pt1/R exhibits higher energy barriers and an alternative, less favorable formats pathway, resulting in reduced catalytic efficiency. These results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate support phase is vital for optimizing the performance of Pt single-atom catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. By utilizing the unique properties of anatase TiO2, this study provides new insights for the design of more efficient and durable catalysts for RWGS and other CO2 utilization processes, thereby contributing to future advancements in sustainable chemical technologies.

        "dc:description": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer a promising approach for maximizing noble metals utilization in catalytic processes. However, their performance in CO2 hydrogenation is often constrained by the nature of metal-support interactions. In this study, we synthesized TiO2 supported Pt SACs (Pt1/TiO2), with Pt single atoms dispersed on rutile (Pt1/R) and anatase (Pt1/A) phases of TiO2 for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. While both catalysts maintained 100% CO selectivity over time, Pt1/A achieved a CO2 conversion of 7.5%, significantly outperforming Pt1/R (3.6%). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed distinct reaction pathways: the COOH pathway was dominant on Pt1/A, whereas the –OH + HCO pathway was more competitive on Pt1/R. Analysis of electron metal-support interactions and energy barrier calculations indicated that Pt1/A better stabilized metallic Pt species and facilitates more favorable reaction pathways with lower energy barriers. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient SAC systems in CO2 hydrogenation processes.",
