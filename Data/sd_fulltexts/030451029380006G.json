Part 1. CoBr2/Li [ AlH (O-t-butyl) 3 ] 3 system as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of anthracene B. Schuldt, D. Heller*, F. Storz and K. Madeja Department of Chemistry, University of Greifswald, Soldtmannstrale 16, 0-2200 Greifswald (Germany) (Received September 22, 1992; accepted January 15, 1993 ) Abstract The system Li [ AlH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] /CoBrz in THF is a very active catalyst for the hydrogenation of anthracene. The rising activity with increasing concentration of the reducing agent can be described in terms of the formation of a 1:1 adduct between the catalyst and the reducing agent. If the catalyst is kept in a hydrogen atmosphere prior to the addition of the substrate, its activity decreases rapidly. During the addition of the components of the catalyst, at most 0.5 mol H2/mol CoBr, are generated at once, followed by slow HZ generation which can be described as two parallel first-order reactions. From the immediate HZ generation it can be deduced that CoBr2 is reduced to Co' and that the catalyst contains unchanged reducing agent. Key words: alkoxyalanates; anthracene; cobalt; hydrogenation; Ziegler systems Introduction Ziegler systems are not only very valuable catalysts for polymerisation, but also very active and cheap hydrogenation catalysts [ 1 ] . Especially systems with alkoxyalanates as reducing agents are said to be advantageous [ 2 ] . In contrast to the organoaluminium compounds usually used, the easier and safer handling of the alkoxyalanates as well as the high activity and stability of the catalysts are reported as the main advantages of these systems. Above all trist-butoxyalanate is widely recommended, because it can be used in large excess without blocking the catalysts. Although these catalysts are also used indus- *Corresponding author; present address: Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Arbeitsgruppe \"Asymmetrische Katalyse\" University of Rostock, Buchbinderstrasse 5/6, 0-2500 Rostock, Germany; tel.

Catal. 81 (1993)195-206 trially [3,4], little is known about their features. Therefore we investigate some catalysts of the type Li [AIH, (OR) 4-n ] /CoBr2. In this paper we report on some results obtained with the Li [AlH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] /CoBr2 system. Anthracene has been used as substrate for hydrogenation. In the past, mainly the hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatics has been investigated, because they serve as model compounds for similar structural elements in bituminous coal or other fossil fuels [ 5 ] . Recently, the hydrogenation of anthracene with homogeneous catalysts has received increasing interest. Not only high selectivities can be achieved with them, but also conclusions can be drawn from such hydrogenation experiments concerning the catalyst in solution. For instance, using Co2(CO)8 as catalyst exclusively yields 9.10-dihydro-anthracene [6,7], whereas [Rh(diphos) (MeOH)z]+ gives only 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroanthracene [8 ] . According to Halpern [ 7,8 ] , different hydrogenation mechanisms, caused by different kinds of catalyst in solution, are responsible for the course of the catalysis. Results If solutions of CoBr2 and Li [AIH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] in THF are mixed, the reduction of CoBr2 takes place immediately and visibly by the spontaneous generation of hydrogen and deep red-brown colouration of the solution, typical for these systems. The catalyst is not completely dissolved homogeneously, but it is finely suspended in the solution. It is active at once, but activity and stability strongly depend on the method of preparation. For instance, if the CoBr2 solution is added to a solution of the reducing agent, more stable catalysts are obtained, compared to the mixing in reverse order. Attempts to hydrogenate anthracene, naphthalene and phenanthrene with this catalytic system under identical experimental conditions have shown that anthracene is converted rapidly, whereas the two other aromatics consumed only a few percent of the theoretical amount of hydrogen, even after a longer time. In this case a black precipitate separates after some time, the solution becomes clear and the catalyst inactive. Hence, anthracene, naphthalene and phenanthrene show the well known differences in their hydrogenability in this case as well. Figure 1 shows some typical hydrogenation curves of anthracene. In these experiments the concentration of anthracene and CoBr2 in THF was kept constant and that of Li [AIH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] was varied. At an Al/Co concentration ratio of 2.5 (below this the catalyst is inactive or unstable) the hydrogenation curve initially shows an induction period, follows a first order reaction in the middle part, and decreases unusually drastically at the end. At higher AI/Co ratios, however, the catalyst becomes more active, more stable and the hydrogenation rate increases. At Al/Co ratios between 3 and 17.5 the hydrogen ab- B. Schuldt et al. / J. Mol.

(1) . nH2=n.(1-e-ke-t) (1) At higher Al/Co ratios the diffusion of hydrogen into the solution becomes the rate determining step, making the correct estimation of the rate constant more and more difficult. In general hydrogenation reactions follow a specific pattern of elementary steps [ 1 ] . Saying that the hydrogen absorption obeys a first-order rate law, means that the overall reaction is described in an abridged form and that the rate constant is a composite quantity, containing at least the concentration of the catalyst KatT: keXP-k[Kat]T. (2) On the assumption that [Kat]T is proportional to the concentration of CoBr2 in solution, n has been determined as being near to one. With this supposition the increasing value of kex, with increasing concentration of the reducing agent can be described as an equilibrium between a less active species Kato and a more active adduct KatRMo of this species, with the reducing agent RM in excess (eqn.

(7). The activity of the catalyst, however, depends not only on the method of preparation and the Al/Co concentration ratio, but also on the time at which substrate is added. In the experiments (results are depicted in Fig.1), anthracene and the reducing agent in THF were placed in the reaction vessel first, and then the corresponding amount of CoBr, solution was added. Finally the stirrer was switched on and the hydrogen absorption is recorded. If, however, the catalyst is prepared in solution first and then after some time the anthracene solution is added, the hydrogen absorption is considerably retarded, as Fig. 3 reveals. The longer the catalyst has been left under hydrogen without substrate, the more its activity decreases and eventually approaches a limiting value. The change in activity can be described in terms of eqn. (8), keXP = ko e-ket+ kn ,,, (1- e-ka` ) where ko is the rate constant at t=0 and k. the final value. This deactivation of the catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere can be observed at several Al/Co concentration ratios. The deactivation takes place more slowly, the larger the excess of the reducing agent is; k,, increases in the same direction. The rate constant ko is identical with the expression for ke,,p in eqn.

Mol. Catal. 81 (1993)195-206 increases with increasing amount of reducing agent it becomes evident that there is an analogous relationship as with that of ko. Then it follows that* [Kat]T= [Kat]o+ [KatRM]o+ [Kat].+ [KatRM]. or [Kat]T=[Kat]oT+[Kat].T respectively. Analogous to eqn.

With this supposition it is, eqn. (13): d[Kat]oT=-ks[Kat]o= k5[Kat]oT (13) dt l+ssl[RM] and after integration (with [ Kat ] OT = [ Kat ] T at t= 0) one obtains eqn.

In order to prove, whether the deactivation of the catalyst is due to decomposition of Li [AlH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] , in some cases fresh reducing agent was added during the hydrogenation. However, only a negligible increase in activity was observed. On the other hand, every decomposition of Li [ AlH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] or re- *The indices in eqn.

In Fig. 4 some representative H2 generation curves of the reaction of CoBr2 with Li [A1H ( 0-t-butyl ) 3 ] in THF at different Al/Co concentration ratios are depicted. These experimental results can be described by the following rate law, eqn. (16 ) nH2=as+al(1-e-kst)+a2(1-e-''`) (16) This rate law is based on the assumption that some of the reducing agent reacts almost immediately with CoBr2, thereby generating an amount of hydrogen that corresponds to ao, and that the subsequent slow generation of hydrogen can be attributed to two unknown reactions which proceed as firstorder reactions parallel to each other. The dependence of the constants in eqn. (16 ) from the Al/Co concentration ratios is related in Fig. 5. Discussion The results presented clearly show that the CoBr2/Li [A1H ( 0-t-butyl ) 3 ] system is a very active and well reproducible hydrogenation catalyst, if certain conditions are taken into account. Thus the CoBr2 solution must be added to a mixture of the reducing agent and the substrate to be hydrogenated, with the reducing agent in sufficiently high excess. Under these conditions the catalyst 202 B. Schuldt et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993)195-206 remains stable during the hydrogenation. However, its activity decreases considerably, if the catalyst is treated with hydrogen before the addition of the substrate occurs. The increasing activity of the catalyst with a larger excess of Li [AlH(0t-butyl) 3 ] can be described by the formation of a 1:1 adduct, which is not very stable. To obtain a stable and highly active hydrogenation catalyst, very large excess of the reducing agent must be used. In contrast, this 1:1-adduct formation seems to be exceptional among catalysts of the type CoBr2/Li [AlH (O-R)3], since other related systems (O-R=O-CH3 or O-C2H40C,H5) are catalytically active only in a small range of Al/Co concentration ratios. Their catalytic activity increases more rapidly, reaches a maximum close to an Al/ Co ratio of 2.3, and then decreases almost as rapidly [ 9 ] . This may be caused by the reduced steric requirements of the organic groups in these two alkoxyalanates, and results not only in a stronger interaction with the catalytic species (or center), but also in the formation of a bis-adduct, which blocks the catalytic centre. If this is indeed the case, the range of activity of the catalyst should be controllable by altering the steric dimensions of the alkoxide groups. Compared with anthracene hydrogenation, the rapid deactivation of the catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere without a substrate is surprising, since during the hydrogenation reaction the catalyst is stable and it is in a hydrogen atmosphere. Deactivation also takes place in the presence of substrates like naphthalene or phenanthrene which cannot be easily hydrogenated. It seems that the substrate is not important in stabilizing the catalyst (as is done by the reducing agent), but more in trapping an intermediate of the deactivation reaction. Indeed the increase in activity with increasing concentration of the reducing agent as well as the decrease in activity in a hydrogen atmosphere can be described quantitatively by eqn. (7) or eqn. (15) , but it should be noted that only a few measured values for curve fitting with these multiple-parameter models are available. Moreover, the values for the deactivation of the catalyst for experimental reasons are concentrated mainly around the initial and the final part of the reaction. Therefore the validity of these models should be confirmed by supplementary experiments. Additional information can be obtained from the hydrogen generation during the reaction of the reducing agent with CoBr, From Fig. 4, it can be seen that after mixing of the components of the catalyst a certain amount of hydrogen (ao) is released immediately, followed by additional but slower hydrogen generation. Since the catalyst is active immediately after the addition of CoBr, to the reducing agent, it is obvious to assume that the immediate hydrogen generation is based on the reduction of CoBr2 and therefore on the formation of the catalytically active species. The quantity of the generated hydrogen immediately first of all increases continuously up to an Al/Co concentration ratio of 1.5, amounting then to about 0.5 mol HZ/mol CoBr2, and decreases thereafter with rising excess of reducing agent.

At an Al/Co ratio of 41 it (Co') comprises about 65% of the CoBr2. Since only 1 mol of Li [AlH (0t-butyl) 3 ] is needed for the reduction of CoBr2, at an Al/Co concentration ratio of 1.5, additionally 0.5 mol of the reducing agent must be a part of the reduction product. This assumption is confirmed by the following observation: if to a solution of CoBr, is added a solution of Li [AIH (0-t-butyl) 3 ] in the molar ratio 1:1, only 0.374 mol H2/mol CoBr2 are generated, i.e. only 75% of the reducing agent has been consumed for the reduction in spite of the excess of CoBr2 present - the rest remains unchanged. However, it reacts with water, thereby releasing the remaining amount of hydrogen. From all these experiments it can be concluded that the active species should be a compound that contains unchanged reducing agent and possibly cobalt in different oxidation states. In 204 B. Schuldt et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 195-206 addition, it can interact with more reducing agent, forming a more active adduct in this way. Attempts to correlate the subsequent slow generation of hydrogen to a definite chemical reaction, have not been successful. For instance, the deactivation of the catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere proceeds much faster than the hydrogen generation. This may be an indication that the catalytic centre is not directly involved in the hydrogen generation, but that the hydrogen comes from some inactive material. This would imply, however, that only some of the product is catalytically active. Equation (16) is not the only possibility to describe the hydrogen generation. A similarly well fitting curve is obtained, when it is assumed that of the two parallel reactions, one proceeds by first-order, the other by second-order rate laws. The dependence of the constants on the Al/ Co ratio, however, is not very different. Other models have not been examined. It should be noted that the hydrogenation curves obtained by using eqn. (1) as well as the characterisation of the catalyst by keXp, is based on some conditions which in the case of the anthracene hydrogenation are fulfilled only approximately. Besides the condition that kexp must be proportional to the concentration of the catalyst (eqn. (2) ), only one hydrogenation product should be formed, or two (or several) in a constant ratio to each other. Gas chromatographic analysis of the hydrogenation products at the end of the hydrogenation reaction, however, has shown that in addition to 9.10-dihydroanthracene (DHA) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroanthracene (THA), also a small amount of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroanthracene (OHA) is formed, the first two very likely in a parallel, and OHA from THA in a subsequent reaction. However, if the Al/Co ratio is changed, the [DHA ] / [THA ] ratio also changes. The final value of the H2 uptake, calculated from the hydrogenation products, corresponds very well with the experimental one, but not with n. from eqn. (1) . The estimated n.-value is generally about 25-30% too high. Since OHA is formed when the THA concentration is high, i.e. near the end of the hydrogenation reaction, the additional hydrogen uptake by the OHA formation results in a flatter hydrogenation curve and this causes not only the exaggerated value of n. but also a deflated value of he,. However, since the n. values do not vary by much, the error in ke,tp is nearly constant and probably small. Only with this assumption, are the changes in the properties of the catalyst approximately correct in terms of the kexp values. Therefore, to characterize the catalyst, it would be better to use a substrate like cyclohexene, whose hydrogenation proceeds stoichiometrically in a straightforward manner. We will report on this topic as well as on the kinetics of anthracene hydrogenation at a later time. Experimental Li[AW(0-t-butyl),,] Commercial LiAlH4 is extracted under argon from a G4-glass frit with diethyl ether into a Schlenk tube, filtered if necessary, and then reprecipitated B. Schuldt et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 195-206 205 by addition of toluene or benzene [ 11 ] . The purified LiAlH4, now free from AIH3, is dissolved again in diethyl ether, and a small excess of absolute tert.butanol is added dropwise. Li [ AM (0-t-butyl) 3 ] separates from the solution as a fine crystalline precipitate, which after filtration, washing with ether, and drying is stored under argon [ 12 ] . To prepare a solution of the reducing agent, the relevant quantity of Li [A1H (0-t-butyl) 3 ] is dissolved in THF, and its concentration is determined by complexometric (Al content) and gasometric or iodometric titration (hydride content) [ 13 ] . CoBr2 Anhydrous CoBr2 [ 14 ] is extracted with dry THF from G4-frit and crystallizes as the THF adduct in the receiver. If necessary, it is recrystallized from a small amount of THF, and dissolved in the required volume of THF. The concentration of CoBr2 is determined with EDTA. Anthracene Commercial anthracene is recrystallized first from glacial acetic acid, and then from ethanol until no more byproducts can be detected by gas chromatography. General procedure for the hydrogenations The method for the automatic registration of hydrogen consumption has been described [ 15,16 ] . The hydrogenation curves were obtained by using eqn. (1) after a Guggenheim plot and then by a parameter optimization from curve fitting by the method of least squares. All experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions [ 17-19 ] , at 298 K, and in each case in 50 ml absolute THF. The CoBr2 concentration was 4 X 10-3 mol/1, and that of anthracene 4 X 10-2 mol/1. To measure the hydrogen generation during the preparation of the catalyst, the hydrogenation vessel was connected to a U-tube manometer filled with the solvent, and a well thermostated piston buret. To make the buret gastight, and to eliminate the dead-volume, the piston was covered with mercury. At the beginning of the measurement the reaction vessel was charged first with hydrogen, then with the alkoxyalanate solution in, and the stirrer switched on. After gas-liquid equilibrium had been achieved the CoBrz solution was added from a syringe and the hydrogen generation measured continuously by lowering the piston to equilize the pressure. For the gas-volumetric determination of hydride content of the alanate solution, the reaction vessel is charged first with diluted H2S04 and then the alanate solution is added. The remainder of the procedure is the same as described above. 206 B. Schuldt et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993)195-206 References 1 B.R.

CoBr2/Li [AlH (O-t-butyl)3]3 system as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of anthracene B. Schuldt D. Heller ∗ F. Storz K. Madeja Department of Chemistry, University of Greifswald, Soldtmannstraße 16, O-2200 Greifswald Germany * Corresponding author; present address: Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Arbeitsgruppe “Asymmetrische Katalyse” University of Rostock, BuchbinderstrasBe 5/6, O-2500 Rostock, Germany; tel. (+37-81)36371, fax. (+37-81)23467. The system Li[AlH (O-t-butyl)3]/CoBr2 in THF is a very active catalyst for the hydrogenation of anthracene. The rising activity with increasing concentration of the reducing agent can be described in terms of the formation of a 1 : 1 adduct between the catalyst and the reducing agent. If the catalyst is kept in a hydrogen atmosphere prior to the addition of the substrate, its activity decreases rapidly. During the addition of the components of the catalyst, at most 0.5 mol H2/Mol CoBr2 are generated at once, followed by slow H2 generation which can be described as two parallel first-order reactions. From the immediate H2 generation it can be deduced that CoBr2 is reduced to CoI and that the catalyst contains unchanged reducing agent.
