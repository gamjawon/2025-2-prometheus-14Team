Hydroformylation of hex-l-ene produces normal and branched aldehydes of 69-85% yield and n/iso ratio l .8-2.0. Hydroformylation of dienes gives unsaturated monoaldehydes (ca. 30% yield). Applying I H, 31 P NMR, UV-VIS and IR spectroscopy the following complexes have been identified: Rh(acacXCO)2L (1), Rh(acac)(COXL) (2), and Rh4(CO)xL,2_X (3) (where: L=cp2Zt(CHZPPh2)z, cpzZrH(CHZPPh2), x=8-11).

PI1 S1381-1169(96)00200-2 Also, dimeric rhodium complexes obtained in the reaction of Rh2(w-SBut)2(CO)4 with cp2Zr(CH ZPPh2)2 [4] or (,q5-ButC5H4)2Zr(CH2PPh2)2 [5] are active in hydroformylation although PPh3 or P(OPh)3 ligands are not present in coordination sphere. The main task of this paper is study of the structure and activity of catalytic systems composed with Rh(acac)(CO)2 as catalyst precursor and zirconium (IV) complexes, playing the role of `zirconium-phosphine' modifying ligand cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2 and cp2ZrH(CH2PPh2), respectively. C atalytic activity of cp2ZrH(CH2PPh2) in olefin isomerization and hydrogenation have been studied previously [6,7]. On the other hand, Zr-complexes (as well as Ti, Nb, V . . . ) were never involved in hydroformylation catalysis. As strongly oxophilic metals they form catalyst poisoning Zr-O bonds. 136 A.M. Trzeciak et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 110 (1996)135-139 The above mentioned rhodium (I)-zirconium (IV) catalytic systems without any additional modifying ligands have been applied for hydroformylation of hex-l-ene, 1,5-hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Studies on reaction: Rh(acac)(CO)2 + cp2 Zr(CH2 PPh2 )2 It was published in our earlier paper that phosphines and phosphites easily substitute carbonyl ligands (one or two) in Rh(acac)(CO)2 forming respective substitution reaction products [8]. Zr (IV) complex, cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2, in reaction with Rh(acac)(CO)2 behaves similar to triphenylphosphine, producing a monosubstituted complex of the formula Rh(acac)(CO)(cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2). However, this reaction is more complicated than that with triphenylphosphine and proceeds with the few stages monitored by 1H, 31P NMR, UV-VIS and IR measurements (Table 1). IR and 1 H NMR studies of the reaction mixture at the concentration ratio [cpzZr(CH2PPh2)2]:[Rh(acac)(CO)2] = 0.5 have shown unreacted starting Rh(acac)(CO)2 complex and also two new rhodium species Rh(acac)(CO)2(cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)z) (1), and Rh(acac)(CO)(cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2) (2). The main product, complex (1), contains two CO ligands (vco 1990, 2055 cm-') and `zirconium-phosphine', cp2Zr(CH2PPhz)2, in coordination cp., Z~ ep C H \"CH 2 PPh CO 2 2 CO%Rh \\ PPh2 O CO (1) Fig. 1. Proposed structure Rh(acacXCO)2(cpZZr(CHZPPh2)2) complex of the sphere. Coordination of zirconium (IV) complex to rhodium via phosphorous atoms is evidenced by the 31 P NMR spectra measurements which show the doublet at 8 33.6 ppm with JRh_P 176 Hz as well as by the shift of proton signals in 1H NMR from 5.76 ppm (for free Zr-complex in C6D6) to 5.85 ppm after coordination to rhodium. The Zr-complex is monocoordinated, which was proved by the presence of the signal of a free Zr(CH 2 P Ph 2) group at 8 - 2.3 ppm in 31 P NMR. The presence of coordinated acetylacetone was confirmed by the presence of two signals of methyl groups at 8 1.7 and 1.35 ppm and the signal at 5.1 ppm assigned for -CH proton. On the base of spectroscopic results the formula Rh(acac)(CO)2(cpZZr(CH2PPh2)2) was proposed for complex (1). Two signals of methyl groups suggest that the complex (1) has no symmetry plane and its most probably structure is shown at (Fig. 1). The second reaction product, complex (2), was observed in very low concentration in reaction performed at [Zr]:[Rh] ratio 0.5. At higher concentration of Zr (IV) complex up to [Zr]:[Rh] Table 1 Spectroscopic characterization of reaction products: Rh(acacXCO)z (S1)+cpzZr(CHZ PPh2)2 (SZ) in C6D6 Substrate (S)/complex formed (P) IR 31 P NMR 'H NMR Uv-vIS (vco/cm-' ) (&/ppm (S/ppm) (nm) ( JRh -P/\"Z)) (S ,) Rh(acacXCO)Z 2020, 2090 - 1.45; 4.9 (acac) 306, 326 (SZ) CP2Zr(CH2PPh2)2 - -3.1 1.4 (CH2); 5.76 (cp) - (P,) Rh(acac)0)2(cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2) (1) 2055, 1990 33.6 (176); -2.3 1.7; 1.35; 5.1 (acac); 5.85 (cp) 398, 418 (P2) Rh(acacXCO)(cpZZr(CHZPPhz)2) (2) 1980 20.4 (129) 1.55; 5.1 (acac); 5.85 (cp) 402 cp =CSH5.

Proposed structure of the Rh(acacxCO)(cp2Zr(CHZPPh2),) complex = 0.9, the complex (2) is the main reaction product. Complex (2) is characterized by the presence of only one carbonyl ligand frequency (vco) in IR at 1980 cm-1 and the doublet in 31 P NMR at 20.4 ppm (JRh_P 129 Hz). The absence of the free Zr(CH 2 P Ph 2) group signal in 31 P NMR in the region 8 - 3 ppm is indicative for the bidentate character of Zr-complex coordination. Complex (2) has a form ula Rh(acac)(CO)(cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)z) with acac and Zr-ligands located in one plane (Fig. 2). The proposed structure is supported by the presence of onl one signal of methyl groups of acac ligand m H NMR at 1.55 ppm. Complex Rh(acac)(CO)(cpZZr(CHZPPh2)2) was isolated in solid. Its IR spectrum shows typical chelating coordination of acetylacetonate ligand (stretching frequencies observed at 1590, 1530 and 1390 cm-1). The increase of cp2ZrtCH2PPh2)2 concentration up to [Zr]:[Rh] = 1.8 do not effect in substitution of the second CO ligand (only one vco at 1970 cm - 1 is observed). However the 31 P NMR signals at 8 ca. 20 ppm (v1/2 150 Hz) and 1H NMR at 8 1.55 ppm and ca. 5 ppm are distinctly broadened. It may suggest appearance of dynamic processes, like that of chemical exchange of triphenylphosphine ligand observed in the system Rh(acac)(CO)2 + PPh3 [9]. Because of low solubility 0f cp 2 ZrH(CH Z PPh 2) in all applied solvents it was not possible to follow the reaction of Rh(acac)(CO)Z with cp2ZrH(CHZPPh2) in solution by spectroscopic methods. However, the final product of that reaction, performed in C 6 H 6 at the ratio [Zr]:[Rh] = 2, was isolated and for- 137 Table 2 Hydroformylation of hex-l-ene catalyzed by the system: Rh(acac)(CO)2 +cp2Zr(CHZPPh2)Z [1] and Rh(acac)(CO)2 + cpZZrH(CHZPPhz) [II].Reaction conditions: 80, 10 atm, HZ /CO = 1, [hex-l-ene]:[Rh]= 390, [Rh]= 1.4 - 10-$ mol, t = 3.5 h [Zr] (10-5 mol) [Zr]:[Rh] Products (% mol) aldehydes hex-2-ene hex-l-ene 0 0 cp2 Zr(CHZ PPh z )z 2.44 - 1.22 0.9 1.69 1.2 cp2 ZrH(CHZ PPhz ) 2.09 1.4 3.69 2.7 14 0 52 85 35 69 69 0 34 13 21 15 17 100 14 1 44 16 mula Rh(acac)(CO)(cp2ZrH(CH2PPh2) was assumed for it on the base of IR measurements.

Trzeciak et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 110 (1996) 135-139 cp2Zr(CHZPPh2)z or cp2ZrH(CHZPPhz) as modifying ligands were used for hydroformylation of hex-l-ene (Table 2) as well as 1,5hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene (Table 3). Generally, the yield of aldehydes increases with the increase of Zr (IV) species concentration (Tables 2 and 3). However, modifying capacity of particular `zirconium-phosphines' are different. The system modified with cpzZrH(CHZPPh2) (system II) at [Zr]:[Rh] = 1.44 and 2.7, produces 35% and 69% of aldehydes, respectively. Modifying effect of cp2Zr(CH2PPhz)2 (system I) is even higher and the yield of 85% is reached at [Zr]:[Rh] = 1.2. The selectivity of hydroformylation was similar in all reactions under studies (n/iso = 1.8-2.0). It is worth to notice that the observed enhanced catalytic activity of the systems studied must be associated with the `in situ' formation of bimetallic rhodium-zirconium complexes. The only Rh(acac)(CO)2 complex has very low activity in hydroformylation (only 14% of aldehydes) and quite significant activity in hex-l-ene isomerization (69% of hex-2-ene). Both Zr (IV) complexes, applied alone under hydroformylation reaction conditions (CO/H 2 = 10 atm), do not catalyze either hydroformylation or isomerization of hex-l-ene. The activity of the catalytic system under study is significantly lower in case of dienes hydroformylation (average yield of aldehydes do not exceeds 30% for system [I] and 59% for system [II] after 6 h). The only reaction products are unsaturated monoaldehydes, 6-heptenal and 2-Me-5-hexenal in hydroformylation of 1,5-hexadiene and 8nonenal and 2-Me-7-octenal in hydroformylation of 1,7-octadiene, respectively. Double bond migrations in both substrates and products were not observed but hydroformylation reaction selectivity was rather low (n/iso < 2). Catalytic activity of bimetallic Rh-Zr complexes in hex-l-ene hydroformylation is comparable to that of Rh(acac)(CO)(PPh3) + PPh3 and Rh(acac)(P(OPh)3}2 + P(OPh)3 systems [10], although selectivity is generally lower. For hydroformylation of dienes, catalytic sys- tems under study are less attractive and dialdehydes, main products of hydroformylation with Rh(acac)(CO)(PPh3) + PPh3 systems [11], were never obtained in the systems modified with zirconium-phosphine. 2.3. The studies on catalyst in post reaction mixture Spectroscopic studies of post-reaction mixtures led us to the statement that complexes of Rh(acac)(CO)(L) type (where L = cpZZr(CHZPPh2)Z or cpzZrH(CHZPPh2)) identified at the beginning of the catalytic process undergo transformation during hydroformylation. 31P NMR studies of the Rh(acac)(CO)2 + cpZZr(CHZPPh2)2 or cp2ZrH(CHZPPh2) mixture in toluene or benzene aged during one hour under 10 atm of HZ/CO at 80, disclosed the doublet at 8 14.5 ppm (Jffi-P = 120 Hz). From that solution, rhodium complex of approximate formula of Rh4(CO)x(cp2Zr(CHZPPhz)Z)12_x (x = 8-11) was isolated in solid OR: vco 2040, 1990, 1970, 1810 cm-1). The structure of that carbonyl cluster was proposed on the basis of IR data [ 12]. In comparable conditions, rhodium complex Rh(acac)(CO)(PPh3) undergoes similar transformation to HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 and Rh4(CO)x(PPh3)12_x (vco for Rh4(CO)8(PPh3)4 2070, 2048, 1995, 1970, 1810, 1800 cm-1) [ 13]. 3. Experimental Rhodium and zirconium complexes were prepared according to the literature methods: Rh(acac)(CO)2 [14], cp2Zr(CHZPPh2)2 [15], cp2 ZrH(CH 2 PPh z) [ 16]. Solvents (toluene, benzene) and olefins were distilled before use. Hydroformylation reaction was carried out in thermostated steel autoclave (40 cm3) with magnetic stirrer. Samples of Rh(acac)(CO)2 (0.0036-0.0045 g) and zirconium complexes (0.006-0.017 g) were introduced to the auto- A.M.

Next, toluene (0.7 cm') and hex-t-ene (0.7 cm') or 1,5-hexadiene (0.35 cm3) or 1,7-octadiene (0.35 cm3) were added, respectively. Finally the autoclave was filled up with H 2/CO = 1 mixture at 10 atm. Reaction products were identified by ' H NMR (Tesla 567 BS 100 MHz or Bruker 300 MHz, 121.5 MHz for 3' P NMR), and after vacuum distillation by GC-MS (Hewlett-Packard) using xylene as internal standard.

Tel.: +48-71-204257; fax: +48-71-222348 Catalytic activity of bimetallic system composed with Rh(acac)(CO)2 and cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2 or cp2ZrH(CH2PPh2) (cp = C5H5) in hex-1-ene, 1,5-hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene hydroformylation have been studied at 80°C, 10 atm of H2 CO = 1. Hydroformylation of hex-1-ene produces normal and branched aldehydes of 69–85% yield and n/iso ratio 1.8–2.0. Hydroformylation of dienes gives unsaturated monoaldehydes (ca. 30% yield). Applying 1H, 31P NMR, UV-VIS and IR spectroscopy the following complexes have been identified: Rh(acac)(CO)2L (1), Rh(acac)(CO)(L) (2), and Rh4(CO) x L12 − x (3) (where: L = cp2Zr(CH2PPh2)2, cp2ZrH(CH2PPh2), x = 8 – 11).
