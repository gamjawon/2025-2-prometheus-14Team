Metal selenides owing to their high theoretical capacity and good conductivity are considered as one of the potential candidates for the anode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical applications are greatly restricted by the poor cycling performances and complicated synthesis methods. In this work, a sandwich-like SnSe2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite with a small amount of rGO (7.3%) is synthesized by a simple one-pot solvothermal technique. The as-synthesized SnSe2/rGO shows improved initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73.7%, high capacity of 402.0 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 with a retention of 86.2% and outstanding rate performances. The abundant Sn−O−C bonds of synthesized material not only accelerate the charge transfer at the interface but also enhance the mechanical strength to accommodate volume variation and prevent active material loss during cycling. Moreover, the compact structure leads to thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI) so that high initial coulombic efficiency was obtained. Furthermore, full cells are assembled to test its potential application. This work offers a simple method to synthesize SnSe2/rGO as a candidate anode for SIBs. Graphical abstract Due to the abundant bonding of Sn-O-C and slight amount addition of rGO, the SnSe2/rGO composite has higher structural stability and initial coulombic efficiency, better electronic conductivity and electrochemical performances. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Sodium-ion batteries Initial coulombic efficiency Ex-situ XRD SEI Tin diselenide 1 Introduction Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted an enormous interest in the energy-storage field due to the low cost and the natural abundance of sodium [1]. Unfortunately, the radius of the sodium ion (1.02 Å) is much larger than that of the lithium ion (0.76 Å), which results in sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics and large volume changes of electrode materials during the cycles [2]. The widely used graphite materials in commercial lithium-ion batteries have been proved unsuitable for SIBs [3]. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials, especially the anode materials, is a challenge for development of SIBs. Recently, metal oxides [4], sulfides [5] and selenides [6] have been synthesized and studied as anodes in terms of SIBs application because of their high theoretical capacity. Among them, oxides usually possess the largest theoretical capacity but the lowest conductivity [7]. Sulfides have higher conductivity than metal oxides, but the “shuttle effect” of polysulfide could result in poor cycle life [8]. Compared with metal oxides and sulfides, metal selenides display a narrower band gap with better conductivity and higher tapping density, signifying better rate performance and higher volume energy density [9]. Unfortunately, metal selenides still face great challenges in practical application. The main problem is the severe capacity decay during the cycling. This can be attributed to the collapse of structure in the sodiation/desodiation process due to the large volume change, which leads to the reduction or loss of electric contact with current collector [10]. Some strategies have been reported to circumvent these problems, such as designing a nanostructure or introducing the carbon-based materials [11]. For example, David et al. synthesized polypyrrole-coated Sb2Se3 microclips by a complex ion-exchange method, delivering a sodium storage capacity of 600 mAh g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.3 A g−1 [12]. The Bi2Se3/C nanocomposite reported by Chen et al. can show a capacity of 469 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, which prepared by multistep ball milling [13]. However, all these methods involve complex reaction routes and they are time consuming. As is well known, nanomaterials and excessive incorporation of carbon will reduce the tapping density and impede the practical application. Therefore, it is a challenge to design a simple way to fabricate metal selenides composite with appropriate carbon content, which can provide satisfactory performance. In this study, sandwich-like SnSe2/rGO composite with little rGO (7.3%) is designed and prepared by a simple one-pot solvothermal method. Graphene oxide with abundant surface functional groups served as a substrate for in-situ growth of two-dimensional (2D) SnSe2 plates, via abundant Sn−O−C bonds at the atomic level, which can not only accelerate the charge transfer at the interface but also enhance the mechanical strength to accommodate volume variation during cycling. The compact interface of SnSe2/rGO also lowered the irreversible capacity of forming solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in initial cycle. As a result, the SnSe2/rGO composite delivered higher initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73.7% and high capacity of 402.0 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 with a retention of 86.2%. In addition, the mechanism of sodium storage of SnSe2/rGO composite was studied via ex-situ XRD and full cells were assembled to test its potential application. 2 Results and discussion The SnSe2/rGO composite was synthesized by a simple one-pot solvothermal method. The schematic diagram of its synthesis process is shown in Scheme 1 . Herein, GO with abundant surface functional groups served as a substrate for growth of SnSe2 plates. And the GO is reduced to rGO during the solvothermal process by hydrazine hydrate. The in-situ growth of SnSe2 along with rGO leads to the formation of strong Sn−O−C bonds at the atomic level, which can form a sandwich-like structure. Furthermore, the growth of SnSe2 particle is limited due to the large surface tension and high viscosity of ethylene glycol. Thus, the SnSe2/rGO composite is a nanoscale material and has a large surface area. Compared with other literatures (Table S1), the synthetic process of SnSe2/rGO composite is simple and time-saving [14]. The morphology of SnSe2/rGO composite was confirmed by SEM and TEM. It is found that the sheet-shaped SnSe2 grows along with and attaches to rGO on both sides to form a sandwich-like structure in Fig. 1 (a). The lateral size of SnSe2 is in the range of 200–500 nm. The TEM (Fig. 1b, c) displays that SnSe2 plates locate on the layer of rGO and in accordance with the results of the SEM image. HRTEM image was taken at the edge of SnSe2/rGO as shown in Fig. 1(d). It can be clearly identified that SnSe2 with lattice spacing of 0.29 nm corresponding to (101) planes have been tightly anchored on the layer of rGO. Moreover, in Fig. S2, the SnSe2/rGO sample maintains its primary morphology after supersonic treatment for 1 h, which illustrates that the well-constructed sandwich-like structure is sturdy. In a different circumstance, the bare SnSe2 exhibits microcluster morphology, which is assembled by non-uniform sheets (Fig. S3). The phase component and crystal structure of as prepared SnSe2/rGO composite were characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the main diffraction peaks located at 14.4°, 30.7°, 40.0°, 47.6° are corresponding to the (001), (101), (102), (110) planes of the hexagonal SnSe2 (JCPDS Card No. 23-0602), respectively. But in the XRD pattern of bare SnSe2 (Fig. S1) there are some impure peaks attributed to Se metal. The schematic diagram of SnSe2 crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1(f). It is clearly suggested SnSe2 has a layered structure with the weak van der Waals forces between each interlayer space. Furthermore, the large interlayer space (0.62 nm) of SnSe2 is favorable to a fast Na ion insertion/extraction [15]. The Raman spectrum of the SnSe2/rGO composite is presented in Fig. 1(g). There are two peaks at 113 and 182 cm−1, which are assigned to E g and A 1g modes of hexagonal-type SnSe2 [16]. Moreover, two characteristic peaks around 1346 and 1590 cm−1 are related to d-band (defects and disorders in the graphene) and G-bond (E 2g vibrations of graphene), respectively [17]. The calculated I D/I G intensity ratio is 1.82, indicating disordered graphene with structural defects in SnSe2/rGO composite, which provides sufficient active sites to insert Na. To determine the content of active material for as-prepared SnSe2/rGO composite, TGA was carried out. In Fig. 1(h) the increasing part of curve between 320 °C and 370 °C is observed, which is ascribed to the SnSe2 decomposed into SnO2 and SeO2. The next dramatic mass loss is attributed to the sublimation of SeO2. After that, the weight loss in the curve could be assigned to the oxidation of rGO. When SnSe2/rGO completely transforms into SnO2, the total weight loss was 49.5%. From the results of TGA, the SnSe2 content of SnSe2/rGO composite can be calculated as 92.7 wt%. So through a simple one-pot solvothermal method, the sandwich-like SnSe2/rGO composite with little rGO (7.3%) is prepared. The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area and the pore distribution of SnSe2/rGO was characterized from N2-sorption measurements. As shown in Fig. S4, the BET surface area of SnSe2/rGO was 16.18 m2 g−1. Additionally, the pore size distribution (the inset of Fig. S4) demonstrates that pores of 90 nm dominate the pore structure in SnSe2/rGO. The Na+ storage properties of SnSe2/rGO composite were investigated in the half-cell in detail. The capacity of the composite material in half cell is based on the mass of SnSe2. Fig. 2 (a) presents CV of SnSe2/rGO for the first three cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V with a scanning rate of 0.2 mV s−1. In the first cathodic scan, the peak at 1.47 V is attributed to the intercalation of Na+ into the SnSe2 interlayers [18]. The subsequent peak at 0.59 V is related to the conversion and alloying reactions, along with the decomposition of electrolyte and formation of SEI layers [19]. In the first anodic scan, a series of peaks at 0.8 and 1.47 V should be attributed to multi-step de-sodiation processes and the peak at 1.93 V can be assigned to formation of Na x SnSe2 [20]. Obviously, the CV curves of SnSe2/rGO are almost coincident in the 2nd and 3rd cycles with an excellent reversibility. On the contrary, it is clear to see that the CV curves (Fig. 2b) of SnSe2 for the 2nd and 3rd cycles cannot overlap very well and redox peaks are not obvious, suggesting the disappointing reversibility and the low electrochemical activity. Therefore, the introduction of rGO can effectively prevent the loss of active materials and improve electrochemical reversibility. The galvanostatic discharge-charge profiles of the first three cycles of SnSe2/rGO at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 2(c). The SnSe2/rGO electrode exhibits a high initial discharge and charge capacity of 632.6 and 466.5 mAh g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 73.7%. The capacity loss is mainly attributed to the formation of SEI films and partial irreversible sodiation/desodiation process in the first cycle. However, the SnSe2 electrode can only deliver initial discharge and charge capacity of 415.4 and 184.2 mAh g−1 with a low coulombic efficiency of 44.3%. The rate performance of SnSe2/rGO and SnSe2 is shown in Fig. 2(d). The charge capacities of SnSe2/rGO are 486.7, 457.5, 433.9, 403.0, 352.2, 276.3, 211.6 mAh g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 A g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of SnSe2 electrodes. When the current density recovers to 0.1 A g−1, the SnSe2/rGO can resume a capacity of 492.0 mAh g−1, indicating the good reversible during the repeated sodiation/desodiation processes after first cycle. In Fig. S5, the discharge-charge curves of SnSe2/rGO at various current densities from 0.1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1 keep the similar shape, indicating the similar reaction mechanism even at high rates. Furthermore, the cycling performance of SnSe2/rGO and SnSe2 at 0.1 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 2(e). SnSe2/rGO electrode exhibits a high charge capacity of 402.0 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 150 cycles with a capacity retention of 86.2%. The charge–discharge profiles in different cycles shown in Fig. S6 demonstrate well-retain of the sodium storage characteristics of SnSe2/rGO electrode. For comparison, the SnSe2 electrode without graphene shows rapidly capacity decay and low capacity (72.6 mAh g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) during cycling, confirming effectively cycle stability promotion by introducing of graphene in SnSe2. The polarization of SnSe2 is larger and the plateau almost completely disappeared. Moreover, the rate capability of metal selenide based anode materials for SIB reported up to now are summarized in Fig. 2(f) [14e,21]. SnSe2/rGO in this work shows outstanding rate performances even at high current densities. In view of satisfactory performances of SnSe2/rGO in half cell and from perspective of practical application, it is also tested in a full cell. The schematic illustration of full cell is shown in Fig. 2(i), in which Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) composite and SnSe2/rGO are used as the cathode and the anode material respectively, and the electrolyte is 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC (1:1) with 5 wt% FEC. In addition, to ensure the maximized material utilization and reasonably evaluate the electrochemical property of the SnSe2/rGO, the full cell in this work is assembled based on the mass ratio of ≈6:1 between the NVP/C cathode and SnSe2/rGO anode and the cell capacity is calculated based on the weight of anode material only. Fig. 2(g) exhibits the charge and discharge curves of NVP/C and SnSe2/rGO. The redox plateaus of NVP/C cathode locate at ∼3.4 V. Therefore, combining to the discharge/charge curves of SnSe2/rGO, the voltage window of full cell is set between 0.8 and 3.2 V. The cycling performance of NVP/C at 1 C is shown in Fig. S7, and the reversible capacity is 84.8 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles indicating the good cycling performance. The charge-discharge curves for the initial three cycles of the SnSe2/rGO//NVP/C full cell are shown in Fig. 2(h). The main capacity (79.6%) of full cell is in the voltage range of 1.5–2.6 V. The initial discharge and charge capacity are 438.3 and 328.1 mAh g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 74% (capacity based on anode electrodes). The cycling performance of SnSe2/rGO//NVP/C full cell at 0.1 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 2(i). It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 251.9 mAh g−1 with 76% capacity retention after 30 cycles. Furthermore, the energy density of full cell is calculated based on the total mass of NVP/C and SnSe2/rGO (Fig. S8). It exhibits a high energy density of 67.0 Wh kg−1 after 30 cycles. To investigate the sodium storage mechanism of SnSe2/rGO, ex-situ XRD was performed at different discharge/charge states in the initial cycle (Fig. 3 a). Evidently, when discharged to 1.5 V, the peaks assigned to SnSe2 at 14.4° and 30.7° shifted to lower angles due to the lattice expansion in sodiation process to form a partial sodiation intermediate Na x SnSe2 (Eq. (1)) [22,14d]. After discharged to 0.5 V, the peaks at 18.5°, 26.9°, 32.1° and 35.5° appears, which correspond to Na15Sn4, Na29.58Sn8, Sn, and Na2Se, respectively, suggesting the conversion reaction and alloying reaction occur. (Eq. (2, 3)) [23]. When completely discharged to 0.01 V, the peaks of Sn and Na29.58Sn8 disappear and Na15Sn4 is maintained as final alloy product (Eq. (3)). These results show transformation of SnSe2 to Na15Sn4 during the discharge process. After charged to 2.1 V, the Na15Sn4 alloy gradually transforms to Sn (Eq. (4)). Finally, when charged to 3 V, almost no peaks can be distinguished. According to the different curves between 1st and subsequent cycles in CV and galvanostatic discharge/charge tests, SnSe2 indeed cannot be reversibly formed. Combining the analysis of the CV curves, the reaction mechanism of SnSe2 is as follows: Discharge: (1) SnSe2 + xNa+ + xe− → Na x SnSe2 (2) Na x SnSe2 + (4−x)Na+ + (4-x)e− → 2Na2Se + Sn (3) 4Sn +15Na+ + 15e− → Na15Sn4 Charge: (4) Na15Sn4 → 4Sn +15Na+ + 15e− (5) 2Na2Se + Sn → Na x SnSe2 + (4−x)Na+ + (4−x)e− The corresponding schematic illustration of sodium storage mechanism is shown in Fig. 3(b), which depicts the conversion reaction combined with alloying conversion reaction in charge–discharge process of SnSe2. First, sodium ions are inserted into SnSe2, causing the crystal to expand. As the discharge progresses, the sodium ions continue to be embedded, which triggers a phase conversion reaction to form Na2Se and Sn. Finally, Sn is alloyed with Na to obtain Na15Sn4. When charging starts, Na15Sn4 is de-alloyed to obtain Sn and Sn returns to Na x SnSe2 rather than SnSe2. The multiple reaction mechanisms contribute to the high capacity, especially the alloy step in low voltage range which is beneficial for the performance of full cell. To interpret the high-rate performance of SnSe2/rGO, the kinetics characterizations was analyzed by CV curves at different scan rates from 0.2 to 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 4 a). As can be seen, all the CV curves display similar shape which demonstrated the reversible electrochemical reaction at increasing sweep rates. The relationship between current (i) and scan rate (v) can be utilized to qualitatively evaluate the contribution of surface capacitance via the Eq. (6) [24]: (6) i = a v b where a and b are the adjustable parameters. If the b value equals to 0.5, the electrochemical process is diffusion-controlled. If the value approaches to 1.0, the process is dominated by capacitive-controlled behavior [25]. The calculated b values from the slops between log (i) and log (v) are 0.77, 0.73, and 0.81, respectively (Fig. 4b). This fact suggests that the system of the SnSe2/rGO anode contains partial capacitive-controlled process. The quantitative capacitive contribution under the given scan rate can be more accurate obtained from another equation: i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1/2, where k 1 and k 2 represent the surface capacitive-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. For example, Fig. 4(c) illustrates a separation of capacitive-controlled current from the entire CV curve at 2 mV s−1, which the capacitive contribution of SnSe2/rGO is around 47%. In Fig. 4(d) the capacitive contribution percentages are raised in order with the increasing of the scan rates, indicating that a larger capacitive contribution is beneficial for Na ion storage and guarantees a high rate capability for SnSe2/rGO. What is more, EIS of the SnSe2/rGO and SnSe2 electrodes were also taken after the first cycle. The Nyquist plots of the electrodes and the relative equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 4(e). The semicircle at high frequencies corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance, and the straight sloping line at low frequencies is related to the diffusion of sodium ions in the electrode [10,26]. R 1 is the ohmic resistance (the resistance of electrode material, the electrolyte, the separator, and the contact resistance of each part) in the cell. R 2 is derived from the resistance of SEI. R 3 represents the charge-transfer resistance [27]. The corresponding fitted impedance results are listed in Table S2, where the R 1, R 2 and R 3 of SnSe2/rGO are 4.3, 24.7 and 11.5 Ω, respectively, lower than those of SnSe2. In addition, the relationship between Z′(real part) and ω 1/2 (ω, angular frequency) is shown in Fig. 4(f), in which σ is the slope of the Z’-ω 1/2 curve. From the calculation method of Na+ diffusion coefficient (D Na + ), higher σ value means lower D Na + . It can be obtained that D Na + of SnSe2/rGO is larger than that of SnSe2. According to above discussed lower charge-transfer resistance of SnSe2/rGO, it is concluded that the introduction of rGO facilitates the fast transport of sodium ions and weakens charge transfer resistance to improve the electrochemical performances. The surface chemical composition of SnSe2/rGO was investigated by XPS test. The survey spectrum (Fig. S9a) reveals the existence of four elements, which are C, O, Sn, Se. In Se 3d scan (Fig. S9b), there are two peaks at 55.3 and 56.2 eV corresponding to Se 3d 5/2 and Se 3d 3/2, respectively, which is ascribed to Se2 4− [28]. For the C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 5 a) of pristine state electrode, six peaks including C−C, C−O, Sn−O−C, C=O, O−C=O and O− (C=O) −O were identified at 284.8, 285.6, 286.7, 287.5, 288.5 and 289.5 eV, respectively [29]. Compared with the XPS results of SnSe2/rGO powder in Fig. S10, the higher content of oxygen in pristine electrode could be attributed to the binder (CMC) (Fig. S9a).The presence of Sn−O−C clearly confirms the existence of the strong interaction between rGO and SnSe2. Meanwhile, the Sn−O−C bond at 531.8 eV is also found in the high-resolution spectrum of O 1 s (Fig. 5b), and peaks at 533.2 and 531.2 eV are in relation with C−O, and O− (C=O) −O bonds, respectively [30]. Fig. 5(c) displays Sn 3d spectrum, where the two peaks centering at 486.7 and 495.3 eV are ascribed to Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2, respectively, which is a characteristic of Sn4+ in SnSe2 [14a]. Besides, there are two other peaks at 487.7 and 496.2 eV corresponding to Sn−O−C [23], which is conformed to the C 1 s and O 1 s spectra. To verify the persistence of Sn−O−C bond during cycling, SnSe2/rGO electrode of both discharged and charged states were monitored by XPS. Impressively, the Sn−O−C bond is successfully maintained after an entire cycle in both C 1 s and O 1 s scans, even though the intensity is relatively lowered due to the covering of SEI on surface which is confirmed from the obviously strengthened C=O (Na2CO3) species in O 1 s scan [30a]. The different structures between SnSe2/rGO and SnSe2 are critical for the electrochemical performances. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the diagram illustrates the 2D SnSe2 plates are tightly anchored on graphene layers and the structure and interface is compact (Fig. S2). During Na+ insertion, the SnSe2 templates stay connective to graphene because of Sn−O−C bond. Moreover, the mechanically stable graphene and integrate structure accommodate the volume strain and formation of SEI on surface is effective and slight [31]. Thus, the kinetics of ionic and electronic transmission between the SnSe2 and rGO can be effectively elevated for lower polarization. Therefore, both rate and cycling performances are improved. On the contrary, the surface of bare SnSe2 largely exposes to electrolyte which triggers severe decomposition of electrolyte to form SEI (Fig. 5e). SnSe2 particles are easily to crack during Na+ insertion because of the shortage of supporting templates. Subsequently, the fracture surface of SnSe2 brings about continuous formation of SEI until the complete passivation of interface [32]. The disastrous behavior of bare SnSe2 leads to low ICE (44.3%) and inferior cycling performance. 3 Conclusions In summary, sandwich-like SnSe2/rGO with abundant Sn−O−C bonds was prepared with a facile one-pot solvothermal method. The obtained material displays high initial coulombic efficiency, high capacity, high stability and excellent rate performance as anode for sodium-ion batteries. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to following: (i) The abundant Sn−O−C bonds in SnSe2/rGO improve the structure stability. (ii) Compact structure of SnSe2/rGO can improve the initial coulombic efficiency. (iii) Compact structure of SnSe2/rGO can prevent the loss of active substances. (iv) Little rGO is beneficial for the energy density. In addition, the mechanism of sodium storage of SnSe2/rGO composite was studied via ex-situ XRD, which indicated that it combined with both alloy and conversion mechanisms. Finally, a full cell was assembled with NVP/C as the positive electrode and SnSe2/rGO as anode. Its specific discharge capacity was 438.3 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 which was reversibly maintained at 251.9 mAh g−1 after 30 cycles. This work offers a method to synthesize SnSe2/rGO simply and a candidate anode for sodium-ion batteries.

        "dc:description": "Metal selenides owing to their high theoretical capacity and good conductivity are considered as one of the potential candidates for the anode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical applications are greatly restricted by the poor cycling performances and complicated synthesis methods. In this work, a sandwich-like SnSe2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite with a small amount of rGO (7.3%) is synthesized by a simple one-pot solvothermal technique. The as-synthesized SnSe2/rGO shows improved initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73.7%, high capacity of 402.0 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 with a retention of 86.2% and outstanding rate performances. The abundant Sn−O−C bonds of synthesized material not only accelerate the charge transfer at the interface but also enhance the mechanical strength to accommodate volume variation and prevent active material loss during cycling. Moreover, the compact structure leads to thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI) so that high initial coulombic efficiency was obtained. Furthermore, full cells are assembled to test its potential application. This work offers a simple method to synthesize SnSe2/rGO as a candidate anode for SIBs.",
