Cortds Corberfin lnstituto de Catalisis y Petroleoquimica, C.S.I.C., Campus U.A.M. -- Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain Received 5 December 1994; accepted 23 February 1995 Abstract This review summarizes published data on catalytic performances of different vanadium-containing oxides, including unsupported and supported V205, vanadates, solid solutions and mixed phases, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C5 alkanes. The analysis of the structure-activity relationships shows that various species characterized by a different reactivity exist on the surface of these catalysts. There are some indications that tetrahedral vanadium species are the most favourable for alkane oxidehydrogenation. Its intrinsic activity seems to be largely dependent on the structure of the nearest surrounding and, therefore, can be modified by changing the nature and number of the neighbouring ions. Although the reaction mechanism is generally accepted to be through the redox cycle between V5 + and V4 +, opposite relationships between catalyst activity/selectivity and reducibility have been established, even for the same catalytic systems. No clear interpretation regarding the mode of alkane activation can be derived from a survey of the literature. This and some other aspects of the reaction mechanism need further studies at a molecular level. Keywords: Active site; Alkane; Mechanism; Oxidative dehydrogenation; Structure; Vanadium oxide 1.

Introduction The dehydrogenation reactions could be used by industry for the production of propene, butene, butadiene, isobutene and isoprene from the corresponding alkanes. All these reactions are reversible due to the hydrogen evolved, and the alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. In order to shift it towards the formation of the dehydrogenation products, the reactions are carried out at relatively high temperatures (from 820 to 920 K). At these temperatures, however, cracking of hydrocarbons occurs, reducing the selectivity of the reaction. The coke deposition causes a decrease in catalyst activity and the need for frequent regen- eration. One more difficult technological problem to be solved is the necessity to provide heat at high temperatures, which usually makes the process energy and capital intensive. Many of these obstacles can be overcome by providing the heat necessary for the reaction via 'in situ' oxidation of the hydrogen evolved as a product of pure dehydrogenation, or by operating with the stoichiometric oxidant in the presence of a catalyst capable of transforming the reaction into an oxidation [ 1-3]. The reaction, therefore, becomes exothermic and able to proceed at much lower tem- peratures at which the formation of carbon and cracking products is insignificant. A further advantage is that the conversion is no longer limited by thermodynamic factors. As oxidizing agents, molecular oxygen, nitrous oxides, halogens, elemental sulphur or its compounds, and others can be used. The most attractive reactant for industrial purposes seems to be molecular oxygen because of its low cost and less severe environmental impacts. According to Alkhazov and Lisovskii [2], dioxygen may perform different functions during the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The first one is facilitating the pure dehydrogenation reaction by converting molecular hydrogen to water and shifting in this way the equilibrium towards the formation of dehydrogenated hydrocarbons. In this case, the process consists of two reactions occurring in sequence either on different sites of one catalyst or on different catalysts: * Corresponding author. Fax ( + 34-1) 5854760. E.A.

Cortes Corberdn /Applied Catalysis' A: General 127 (1995) l~tO 3 CnH2n + 2 ~- CnH2n + H2 H2-k- 0.502 ~ H20 In addition, dioxygen can burn the coke deposited on the surface, thus preventing a loss of catalytic activity. It is evident that this kind of reaction, which can be regarded as an oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation, requires the dihydrogen oxidation to run at a rate not lower than the rate of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. In another kind of reaction, dioxygen reacts directly with the hydrocarbon mol- ecule on the catalyst surface yielding the products of oxidative dehydrogenation: CnHzn+2 -t- 0.502 ~ CnHzn q- H20 Since hydrogen desorption to the gas phase does not take place here, the reaction can occur on catalysts which are not active in dihydrogen oxidation. This feature may serve as a good evidence in favour of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. In the presence of dioxygen, other oxidation reactions, such as partial oxidation to aldehydes or acids and combustion to carbon dioxide, usually occur, reducing the selectivity to dehydrogenation. The total oxidation is the most undesirable reaction. To diminish it, a periodic operation of the reactor using the metal oxide as oxygen transfer agent has been proposed [4]. In this mode of reaction, the metal oxide is first contacted with hydrocarbon (steam is often added to the feed), resulting in oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and partial reduction of the metal oxide; the reduced metal oxide is then converted into a fully oxidized state by treatment with oxygen: CnHzn + 2 q- MxOy --~ CnH2~ q- H20 nt- MxOy- 1 MxOy- 1 + 0.502 --* MxOy This reaction strategy indeed can provide higher selectivity in comparison with the conventional method where hydrocarbon and oxygen are simultaneously in contact with an oxidation catalyst. The disadvantages are a more complicated technology and the need to develop a physically and chemically stable catalyst that can readily undergo continuous reduction-oxidation cycles. From our point of view, such a reaction with periodic operation should be considered to be noncatalytic because it is conducted using the metal oxide as a stoichiometric reactant, providing lattice oxygen which is depleted during reaction. So, a continuous, catalyst-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons using oxygen as the oxidizing agent appears to be more promising versus simple dehydrogenation. It enables one to achieve total conversion at much lower temper- atures. The main limitation is the formation of by-products, not always of economic interest. The oxidehydrogenation of alkanes produces usually a considerable amount of carbon oxides because of the low selectivity of the catalysts employed. The key aspect of the technology is, therefore, the development of catalysts capable of activating only the C-H bonds of the alkane molecule in a flow of oxygen. This 4 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corbercin/Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1~40 problem becomes of global importance in light of the petrochemical industry's tendency to be based in the future on the direct use of alkanes as raw materials instead of alkenes [5,6]. The above-reported considerations intensified during the last decade the research in the direction of developing and studying catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. During this time, a wide variety of catalytic systems, ranging from Li/MgO-like superbasic oxides [7,8] to highly acidic zeolites [9,10], have been proposed. Many of them are vanadium mixed oxides whereas effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkenes are based on molybdates [ 11 ], ferrites [12] or antimonates [ 13]. Besides, a number of investigations relating catalyst structure to catalytic activity and selectivity, and comparing one system with another, have appeared in the literature. There are also papers showing the catalyst phase composition or/and structure to be controlled to a large degree by the prep- aration method. For supported catalysts, the nature of the support becomes one more variable in determining the final catalytic properties. Several reviews have discussed oxidation catalysts containing vanadium [ 14- 18], but none is specifically concerned with oxidehydrogenation reactions. The objective of this paper is to screen the present state of the art in developing and studying catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of low-weight alkanes by analyz- ing the literature data published recently. The focus is placed on the vanadium- containing oxides which are currently being extensively studied as catalysts for these reactions. The approach used in the review is to examine the catalyst systems according to the complexity of the chemical composition. In summary, the nature of active sites and some aspects of the reaction network and mechanism are dis- cussed within the context of the catalyst design. 3. Vanadium pentoxide Vanadium(V) oxide is a well-established catalyst for the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to oxygenated products [ 14-17]. Its catalytic behaviour is usually modified when deposited on a support with new surface structures. The most profound changes are frequently observed at low vanadium loadings not exceeding a monolayer. Species in the monolayer display higher activity and/or selectivity than the bulk V2Os, in a number of oxidation reactions [ 18 ]. Similar results have been obtained recently for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. 3.1. Unsupported vanadia Although several papers [ 19-23] have reported the results of oxidative dehy- drogenation of alkanes over unsupported vanadia, usually these data have been used just as a reference to compare with the data obtained on more complex oxidic materials. From these data summarized in Table 1, it is difficult to extract general E.A. Mamedov, V.

The only paper we found specifically devoted to vanadium pentoxide is that by Le Bars et al. [20]. They suggest that better selectivity seems to be a characteristic of the reduced surface. However, it can hardly be maintained under the reaction conditions because of the oxygen diffusion from the bulk. At the steady state, the surface of V205 is close to being fully oxidized and does not retain any strong acid sites. To enhance the ethene selectivity, an optimum regeneration of the surface acidic properties and a rapid removal of the ethene from the reaction zone are claimed [20] to be essential. The catalytic behaviour of vanadia can be improved by depositing on an appro- priate support. Alumina, silica, titania and other oxidic materials have been tested as supports. Silica and alumina have been particularly intensively explored and, therefore, are discussed beneath in some detail. 3.2. Silica-supported vanadia Silica is one of the most widely available supports. Its high surface area is expected to enable a high dispersion. The interaction of vanadia with silica and the structure of vanadium species on the support have been studied by a number of investigators using various techniques, especially infrared spectroscopy of probe molecules [ 24,25 ], X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray absorption near-edge structure [26,27], laser Raman spectroscopy [28], X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy [29,30], electron spin resonance [31], 51V nuclear magnetic resonance [ 32,33 ], UV-visible spectroscopy [ 34], oxygen chemisorption [ 28,35 ], and tem- perature-programmed reduction [36]. It turns out from these studies that at low loadings, vanadia exists in a form of highly dispersed VOx monomeric units. Crystallites of V205 arise at higher loadings which are, yet, below an equivalent of monolayer coverage. 6 E.A. Mamedov, V.

Catalytic activities and selectivities of the silica-supported vanadia monolayer and bulk VzO5 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Key: ( ethane, 800 K, after ref. [ 19] ; ( ethane, 813 K, after ref. [ 41 ] ; ( A ) butane, 793 K, after ref. [22]. There have been several studies on alkane oxidative dehydrogenation using silica-supported vanadia catalysts [ 19,22,37-41 ]. Only few have investigated the effects of loading and structure. The data on catalytic activity and selectivity reported in these papers are summarized in Fig. 1 as a function of the extent of silica coverage with a vanadia layer. Theoretical monolayer coverages have been calculated from the surface area occupied by one single V205 molecule (0.201 nm2) [ 29 ]. One can see that within the range of data obtained for different reactions, the overall activity per gram of vanadium shows a tendency to decrease with increasing vanadia loadings. There is a good agreement in the selectivity trends obtained by Le Bars et al. for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [41 ] and by Owens and Kung for that of butane [22]. In both reactions, the lower loading samples display essentially higher selectivity to alkenes than the bulk V205. Fur- thermore, the decrease in selectivity as the conversion increases occurs much more slowly on these than on the higher loading samples, indicating that secondary reactions run faster on the latter. The differences in dehydrogenation selectivity have been found to correlate with the different vanadia structures present in silica- supported catalysts [ 22 ]. Laser Raman spectra of low-loading samples (up to 0.02 monolayer coverages) showed that only a well-dispersed vanadia species existed on their surface, while crystalline V205 was also formed on the higher loading samples (0.22-0.31 monolayer coverages). As the V205 species were suggested to contribute to the production of carbon oxides, better dehydrogenation selectivity on the low-loading samples was attributed to the presence of well-dispersed vana- dia. This was proposed to be a vanadyl group bonded to three oxygen ions of the support as follows: E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) l~lO 7 (Si-O) 3V=O Such a distorted vanadium tetrahedron, confirmed also by use of 5~V spin echo and MAS NMR techniques [33], is expected to provide lower availability of lattice oxygen (in terms of number) and thus be more selective than the crystalline V205 where the vanadium ion is octahedrally coordinated. When in contact with ambient air, VOx species can react with atmospheric moisture giving a hydrated form. The evidence for acidic hydroxyl groups reported in ref. [41] could be related to the hydrated forms. The wideline 51V NMR lineshapes obtained for vanadia on silica under ambient (surface hydrated) conditions closely resemble those observed for bulk crystalline V205 [33]. Upon heating in a dry atmosphere, dehydration to a simple vanadyl species with the structure shown above may occur. As for the acidic character of silica-supported VOx monolayers, they have been regarded [41] as medium acidic materials containing both Lewis and BrOnsted acid sites of similar strength. An increase in their acidity enhances the rates of ethane total conversion and oxidative dehydrogenation but does not affect the selectivity to ethene. Owens and Kung [22] have emphasized the role of redox properties of the vanadium in determining the observed selectivity. In particular, the ease of oxygen removal from the lattice and the number of available lattice oxygen ions at the active site have been claimed to be the determining factor. The results of temper- ature-programmed reduction reported in refs. [36,40] show that silica-supported samples with dispersed vanadia undergo the reduction by hydrogen and ethane more easily than bulk V205 and silica-supported samples which contain crystalline V205. The increased oxygen mobility of the isolated vanadia species can explain their higher total activity but not the higher dehydrogenation selectivity. It appears that there is one more factor which plays an important role in determining the dehydrogenation selectivity. This may be a type of vanadium-oxygen bond that is involved in the rate-limiting step. One can expect that the activation of an alkane molecule by nucleophilic bridging oxygen will occur through a mechanism different from that involving more electrophilic double-bonded oxygen. Consequently, dif- ferent adsorbed intermediates and reaction products from them will be formed, but no experimental data, relating to this question, have been reported so far. A com- bined use of IR, XPS and EXAFS techniques could throw some light on this point. At variance with the above results, Oyama and Somorjai [ 19] have found that the oxidation of ethane to ethene occurs with high selectivity on high-loading vanadium oxide on silica while the lower loading samples display the same selec- tivity as the unsupported V205 does. Nevertheless, the results of catalyst charac- terization are in excellent agreement with those discussed above. Using laser Raman spectroscopy, Oyama et al. [28 ] have arrived at the conclusion that at low loadings (0.03 and 0.19 monolayer coverages), the vanadium oxide species is molecular, consisting of monomeric V=O units anchored to the silica surface. At higher loadings (0.43 to 1.14 monolayer coverages), it nucleates into small V205 crys- tallites, of size < 4 nm, but identical to bulk vanadium pentoxide. The considerable 8 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corber6n/Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 jump in selectivity between loadings of 0.19 and 0.43 monolayers has been explained [42] suggesting different modes of ethane adsorption on monomeric vanadyls and on the surface of crystallites. This topic is discussed in detail in the Summary. Here we would like to propose an alternate explanation for the discrep- ancy between the selectivity trends of silica-supported vanadia reported in refs. [22,41], on the one hand, and in ref. [19], on the other. As far as there were no differences in the structure of the catalysts under comparison, the reason might be in the conditions of testing catalytic activity. The data presented in Fig. 1 were obtained at close temperatures (from 793 to 813 K) but with different reaction mixtures. Oyama and Somorjai [ 19] used a reaction mixture which contained a rather high (10 kPa) partial pressure of steam. Moreover, before every run the catalysts were pretreated in a flow of an O2-HzO-He mixture at the reaction temperature. The presence of large amounts of water vapour in the gas phase might impede the desorption of water molecules at octahedrally coordinated vanadium centres, thus preventing them from transformation into tetrahedrally coordinated ones. Such a change in the coordination number was observed in the absence of steam on isolated vanadyls but not on bulk vanadium pentoxide. If one assumes that this phenomenon contributes to the enhancement of dehydrogenation selectiv- ity on well-dispersed vanadia, an assumption advanced in ref. [41 ], then it becomes clear why the selectivity of low-loading catalysts in the presence of water does not differ from that of unsupported V205. The effect of water on the structure of VOx species has been discussed earlier in refs. [ 18,26,33]. As has been suggested by Bond and Tahir [18], the hydrated form of the monolayer species may become dehydrated at the temperatures gen- erally used for catalysis. On the other hand, many of the reactions performed by these catalysts produce water which may hydrate VOx species. They have concluded that only in-situ measurements under reaction conditions can resolve this question. 3.3. Alumina-supported vanadia Alumina-supported vanadia has been the object of numerous structural investi- gations [ 18,26,43-51]. While differences do exist in the details in these reports due to the type of alumina used and its physical properties, the general picture is the same: vanadia forms highly dispersed, amorphous phases whose structure changes from isolated vanadia tetrahedra at low loadings to polyvanadate species at medium loadings. At high loadings, crystalline V205 appears in addition to the amorphous vanadia phases. Reaction studies show [52-54] that catalysts contain- ing multilayered vanadium structures display higher activity (per supported vana- dium ion) and/or higher selectivity to partial oxidation products than both the low-loading samples and bulk VzOs. In Fig. 2, we have brought together the data on catalytic activity and selectivity of alumina-supported vanadia monolayer in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes based on published sources [ 55-57 ]. These data were obtained at different E.A. Mamedov, V.

The rate of alkane conversion expressed per gram of vanadium increases with vanadium concentration within the monolayer coverage; above that loading, the activity seems to decrease. The propene selectivity over catalysts with different vanadia loadings has been found [57] to decrease with the propane conversion, fitting the same selectivity--conversion curve. It means that at a constant conversion, the catalyst's selectivity in the reaction of propane does not depend on vanadium concentration in the range equivalent to monolayer coverages from 0.28 to 0.65 (Fig. 2, dotted line). At a similar conversion level (7-8%), the selectivity for dehydrogenation of butane, in contrast, depends on the vanadia loading, decreasing with its concentration on the alumina. As for the analogous data on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, they are not reported in ref. [55]. The structure of the VzOs/AI203 catalysts used in the reaction of propane has been studied by Eon et al. [57]. Based on the results of UV-visible, diffuse reflec- tance, Raman, 5tv NMR and ESR spectroscopic measurements, they have con- cluded that during the calcination at 773 K, the vanadium environment changes mostly towards tetrahedral species which form polyvanadate chains. The most important fact is that the nature of these chains has been found to be similar in all three samples having different vanadia loadings. This result explains similar catalyst selectivities at the same conversion level, but conflicts with the fact that their activity per vanadium atom increases with increasing vanadia loading. It has been assumed l0 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Ct)rber6n / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1~40 [ 57 ] that the catalytic activity is determined by the mean distance between vanadate chains, increasing with an increase in lateral interactions. Raman studies of the catalysts tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane suggest [58] that in the higher loading sample with a near monolayer coverage, a larger fraction of vanadia was in a two-dimensional network, whereas in the lower loading sample there were more isolated VOx species. The differences in their activities and selectivities have been interpreted in terms of the binding strength of the lattice oxygen to the catalyst. By a combined use of pulse technique and calorimetry, it was shown [56] that in the lower loading sample, lattice oxygen was bound more strongly than in the higher loading catalyst. This result is consistent with the TPR data, according to which the reduction rate of the alumina-supported vanadia phase increases as the vanadia loading increases [44]. The decreased mobility of lattice oxygen is thus suggested to provide lower activity but better selectivity, as was observed for many reactions of partial oxidation of hydrocarbons [17]. 3.4. Titania-supported vanadia The literature data [ 59,60] report high activity of the V205/TIO2 system in the oxidative conversion of propane at relatively low temperatures (500-600 K). The selectivity to propene is poor, decreasing from 28% on the low-loading (5 mono- layers) catalyst to 12% on the higher loading ( 20 monolayers ) sample. The addition of potassium to the catalyst decreases the overall activity and increases the dehy- drogenation selectivity. This effect, which is more distinct for preparations on high specific surface area TiO2, has been explained [60] suggesting that the potassium hinders the formation of the electrophilic O- species responsible for total oxidation of hydrocarbons. The butane oxidation over both monolayer and multilayer vanadia catalysts yields only carbon oxides; no dehydrogenation products have been detected upon varying the oxygen partial pressure in a rather wide range [61 ]. The reaction rate at various concentrations of oxygen has been found to be proportional to the amount of V=O species in the catalyst. The specific activity of these species on both anatase- and rutile-supported catalysts is lower than that of the unsupported V205, indicating the retarding effect of the support on the activity. This is in contrast to the known promoting effect of TiO2 support on the vanadia activity in many other oxidation reactions [ 18 ]. From these data, it follows that TiOz-supported vanadia is a less selective oxi- dehydrogenation catalyst than those supported by SiO2 or A1203. This may be unexpected, as the type of vanadia species reported on titania [ 18 ] is not different from those detected on alumina or silica. However, according to Haber et al. [26], the nature of the vanadia monolayer on TiO2 is somewhat different from those on silica or alumina. It possesses a higher concentration of monovanadate species which gives a higher overall oxygen capacity to the layer. Thus, oxygen is readily E.A. Mamedov, V.

Assuming that these properties favour the oxygen insertion into the reacting molecule, one can understand why titania-supported vanadia catalysts are not selective in the oxidehydrogenation reactions. 3.5. Effect of the nature of the support The data discussed in Sections 2.1 to 2.4, when taken collectively, show that the catalytic behaviour of the supported vanadia depends on the nature of the support. There are two publications in which attempts have been made to study specifically the effect of the support. Corma et al. [59] showed that high-loading ( 19 wt.-%) silica-, alumina- and titania-supported vanadia catalysts displayed similar activities and selectivities close to those of unsupported V205 in propane oxidehydrogenation (Table 1 ). Higher (23-35%) selectivities were obtained over Sm203-, MgO- and Bi203-supported samples due to the presence of their respective bulk orthovana- dates. These results imply that the nature of the support has no effect on the supported vanadia at high loadings when crystalline V205 is formed. In the other paper [ 62 ], structural features and catalytic properties of the vanadia supported by y-alumina and aluminium niobate have been compared in the oxi- dative dehydrogenation of propane. Catalytic results for two of these samples are presented in Table 2 together with similar catalysts supported on other oxidic materials. Inasmuch as surface areas of supports, vanadium loadings in terms of the support surface coverage (O) and reaction conditions do not differ strongly, only two variables will be considered when analyzing the catalytic results sum- marized in Table 2. These are the structure of surface species and the chemical nature of the support. Both isolated and associated vanadate species are present on the catalysts, the proportion changing with the nature of the support. The former is dominating on the surface of magnesium silicate whereas the latter is abundant on y-alumina. The propene selectivity pattern is, however, consistent for the four catalysts. Large differences exist in their catalytic activity expressed here as the conversion per gram of vanadium for lack of the reaction rates in some publications. 12 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corber6n / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 For instance, the VOx/A1203 catalyst is much more active than the VOx/A1NbO4 catalyst, so that it has not been possible to compare them at the same temperature. This point is more obvious from the turnover numbers reported in ref. [62]. The lowest activity is characteristic of the magnesium silicate-supported catalyst. These differences in catalytic activity could be explained suggesting that isolated vana- dium sites are generally less active than associated ones. Such an explanation, however, contradicts the observation that monomeric vanadyl species grafted onto A1NbO4 are more active than polymeric chains [ 63]. Corma et al. [ 65] have also found that the isolated VO4 species supported by Mg4Si6Ol5 display a high activity which is not lower than that of the condensed (VO3)n species. So, it appears that different overall activities of the catalysts listed in Table 2 are more related to the influence of the support than to the structure of active species. In principle, the reactivity of the vanadate species may depend on the bonds formed with the support during the chemical reaction between superficial hydroxyl groups and vanadium salts. This interaction is highly dependent on the acid-base properties which are different from one oxide to another [ 66]. The amorphous A1PO4 contains both phosphorus and aluminium hydroxyl groups, the former being more acidic [ 67 ]. During the catalyst preparation, vanadium salt reacts with them, forming A1- O-bonded and P-O-bonded species. At low vanadia loadings equivalent to cover- ages up to 0.3, the P-O-VOx species are dominating and suggested to be less active than AI-O-VOx [64]. Taking into account the higher electronegativity of pS+ (22.7, calculated using the expression proposed in ref. [68] ) compared to A13 (10.3), one can assume that the oxygen of the vanadia species bonded to aluminium is more nucleophilic and is, therefore, more reactive in activating the alkane mol- ecule through a heterolytic dissociation of the C-H bond than the same species bonded to phosphorus. This idea is applicable to the vanadia catalysts supported by A1NbO4 which also showed [69] the presence of different hydroxyl groups bonded to aluminium and niobium with different acid-base properties. The elec- tronegativity of Nb5 (13.5) is intermediate between those of AI3 and p5 +, so the reactivity of the Nb-O-VOx species is expected to be lower than that of A1-O- VOx but higher as compared to P-O-VOx. This is the case in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (Table 2). The interpretation from this point of view of catalytic results obtained for magnesium silicate-supported vanadia is complicated for lack of information on the bonds formed during the interaction between vanadia and support. In this case, it is rather strong, even leading to a partial destruction of the support [ 65 ]. The properties of dispersed vanadia species may depend also on the preparation procedure of the support. It has been shown that the acidity of hydroxyl groups is a function of the calcination temperature of the A1NbO support, being much higher on crystallized oxide than on amorphous solid. This may, as evidenced by the 5~V NMR spectrum [63], modify the electronic distribution in the V-O bond and, consequently, its reactivity. As for the method and conditions of vanadium depo- sition, these variables seem not to affect strongly the structure and catalytic behav- E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corber6n/Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 13 iour of supported vanadia, y-Alumina has been shown [57] to adsorb different vanadate species at different pH without change of valence state and local environ- ment of the vanadium. During the calcination at high temperature, however, the vanadium environment changes mostly towards tetrahedral species which then form, depending on the vanadia loading, isolated or associated structures. Another example concerns the V205/SIO2 system; the catalysts prepared by grafting have been found [41 ] to exhibit practically the same activity in the oxidative dehydro- genation of ethane as the samples prepared by aqueous impregnation. The support may also influence directly the dehydrogenation selectivity by adsorbing alkane or reaction product on its uncovered surface and giving rise to secondary reactions. As was shown in ref. [ 55 ] by using a DRIFT mode of infrared spectroscopy, flushing alumina-supported vanadia catalysts with an ethane/air reacting mixture led to the appearance of adsorbed carbonate and formate species localized on uncovered alumina. Similar experiments with an ethene/air mixture resulted in the formation of acetate species. As such adsorbed species were not detected on bulk vanadium pentoxide, it was suggested that the uncovered alumina, along with BrCnsted acid groups of the vanadium oxide layer, were involved in the formation of total oxidation products. In this case, one may expect the dehydro- genation selectivity to be dependent also on the properties of support surface, in particular on its acid-base character. Due to the high electron densities at the 7r bonds, alkenes are considered basic. They will adsorb weakly on the basic surface, thus resulting in a much lower reactivity compared to that on the acidic surface. The data discussed in this section show that the catalytic behaviour of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes depends on the amount and nature of the superficial species and on the intrinsic reactivity of surface sites. The key aspects resulting from these data can be summarized as follows: (i) Compared to bulk vanadium pentoxide, the dehydrogenation selectivity is improved for low vanadium loadings, corresponding presumably to the tet- rahedral species; these are suggested to be isolated tetrahedra as well as two- dimensional arrays of them. (ii) The specific activity expressed per gram (or m2) of catalyst increases roughly linearly with increasing vanadium concentration within the monolayer cov- erage. Above that loading, more vanadium atoms are inserted in a V205 lattice, which is not accessible for the reaction, and the activity increases less than what the vanadium loading could induce. (iii) More complicated and different dependencies on the vanadia loading are observed for the intrinsic activity (turnover frequency) of the vanadium species supported by different materials. It seems that the reactivity of these species depends not only on their structure but also on the support nature, in particular, on the bonds formed between vanadium and support. So, various species characterized by a different reactivity have been found to exist on the surface of supported vanadia. However, no clear and unequivocal interpretation about the nature of active and selective sites can be derived from the 14 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortis Corbercin / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1~40 analysis of the structure-activity relationships. Most of them were obtained using different starting materials for preparations of similar catalysts and under different reaction conditions. From our point of view, a representative supported system is needed for the structural and reactivity characterization under the same conditions of oxidative dehydrogenation of various alkanes. Another criticism is that few studies [ 22,57 ] took into consideration a possibility of catalyst surface restructuring under the influence of the reaction atmosphere. Meanwhile, it is of crucial impor- tance for understanding the real nature of active species and modelling the reaction mechanism. In relation to this aspect, the effect of the reaction conditions (reagent composition, presence of water or other gas-phase additives, procedure of activa- tion, etc.) on the surface structure and reactivity deserves special investigation with use of in situ characterization techniques. 4. Binary catalysts 4.1. Alkaline vanadates Alkali metal vanadates supported on silica were tested as catalysts for oxidative conversion of ethane using nitrous oxide as oxidant [70]. The main products were ethene, acetaldehyde and carbon oxides. Regarding the selectivity to C2H4, the highest value (45--47%) was found on LiVO3. This was followed by KVO3, RbVO3 and CsVO3. The addition of water to the feed decreased ethene selectivities over all these catalysts, not changing their sequence. The corresponding data on oxidation of ethane with dioxygen were not reported. The catalytic behaviour of barium orthovanadate in the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of butane was studied by Patel et al. [71 ]. Over freshly prepared oxide, a butane conversion of about 6% and a total selectivity to dehydrogenation products of about 60% were observed at 773 K. Both its activity and selectivity declined with time on stream due to the formation of barium carbonate. X-ray diffraction of a used catalyst showed the presence of BaCO3, which was not found in a fresh catalyst. Higher and stable activity is characteristic of magnesium vanadates which were investigated in considerable detail. They are generally very active beginning at about 750 K. Oxidative dehydrogenation and combustion are the major reactions. In Fig. 3, the data on activity and selectivity in propane oxidehydrogenation are plotted as a function of the vanadium content in the VMg oxide catalysts tested at 813-823 K by different research groups [21,23,72,73]. The overall activity expressed by the reaction rate as well as by the propane conversion at constant contact time passes through a maximum corresponding to the vanadia content of about 20 wt.-% (data by Chaar et al. [ 21 ] are not plotted because they were obtained at different contact times). The selectivities to propene at 20% conversion are substantial on the samples with a vanadia content ranging from 25 to 70 wt.-%. E.A. Mamedov, V.

Cortds Corberc~n /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1~40 most catalytic experiments in the latter work were carried out at longer contact times. In spite of this, they fit the same curve. As the dehydrogenation selectivity normally decreases with the butane conversion, it means that Corma et al. [73] obtained lower selectivities probably due to a higher oxygen-to-butane ratio in the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, general trends of both activity and selectivity evo- lutions are similar to those observed in Fig. 3. This indicates that the catalytic behaviour of VMg oxides is similar in both reactions, and that the catalytic results obtained by different researchers do not differ strongly. However, contradictory conclusions have been drawn concerning the active phase responsible for the formation of alkene. Kung and co-workers [ 21,74] attrib- uted the active component to magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V2Os), but Siew Hew Sam et al. [72] suggested that magnesium pyrovanadate (c~-MgzV207) was the active phase, and orthovanadate was responsible for total oxidation. According to the results of their catalytic study on the reference phases, selectivity for propane oxidehydrogenation at isoconversion decreased as follows: Mg2V207 > MgV206 > Mg3V2Os. The highest selectivity for magnesium pyrovanadate has been related [75] to its ability to stabilize V4 + ions associated with oxygen vacancies. This conclusion is supported by the easier reducibility of this phase. The correlation between the propene selectivity and redox properties of pure magnesium vanadates, among which the pyrovanadate was the most selective and reducible, has also been observed by Gao et al. [76]. Analyzing possible reasons of the contradiction mentioned above, some factors, in particular the preparation procedure and contamination by residual elements, have been claimed. To check this point, the effect of residual potassium on the reactivity of VMg oxide catalysts has been studied [77]. Differences were estab- lished in both phase composition and catalytic behaviour of mixed oxides prepared with or without the use of KOH. The samples prepared without potassium contained only orthovanadate as the vanadate phase. In samples prepared by the use of KOH, substantial amounts of pyrovanadate were found, even though according to the overall composition, orthovanadate should be the only vanadate phase present. The presence of residual potassium in the catalyst lowered the selectivity, especially in the butane reaction. Respecting the influence of the preparation method, it should be mentioned that in catalysts prepared by the citrate method [ 23 ], the pyrovanadate phase appeared at vanadia contents higher than 60 wt.-%, whereas those prepared by impregnation [ 78,79] contained the MgzVzO7 phase at much lower concentra- tions of the vanadia. When preparing catalysts by a method of solid-solid reactions, the calcination conditions may be one more variable controlling the relative amounts of the orthovanadate and pyrovanadate phases, since the latter is the intermediate magnesium vanadate [80]. The assignments of the active phase for VMg oxide catalysts by the groups of Kung and Volta were mostly based on the study of the three magnesium vanadate phases. However, the calcination conditions they used to prepare these pure vana- dates were very different from that of VMgO working catalysts. It must also be E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 17 noted from their studies that in working catalysts, at least two phases have been identified simultaneously. Some of them, as seen from Fig. 3, display about the same selectivity as the most selective Mg2V207 phase (69.5 wt.-% V205) does. Moreover, it has been shown [23] that the selectivity of the magnesium orthov- anadate phase can be improved by a coexisting pyrovanadate phase or excess magnesium oxide in intimate contact. When the magnesium pyrovanadate phase coexisted with the metavanadate phase, the overall catalytic performance was more typical of metavanadate. Although the catalytic properties of the VMg oxide system in the reaction of butane have been studied in less detail (Fig. 4), it seems that relatively high oxidehydrogenation selectivities are characteristic of the biphasic samples which correspond to mixtures of the magnesium orthovanadate and MgO phases. These observations indicate that the phase purity affects the catalytic behav- iour of the magnesium vanadate phase, and the presence of one phase is not sufficient to elucidate the catalytic performance of the VMg oxide system. As suggested by Gao et al. [23], some type of cooperation between separate phases may exist in these catalysts. XPS studies of the VMg oxides show [23,72,79] that magnesium and vanadium are present on the surface mainly as Mg2+ and V5 +. In catalysts prepared by the citrate method, a small amount of reduced vanadium species, probably V4 +, were found [ 23 ]. In spite of the great difference between catalyst composition, the V5 + / V4 + surface atomic ratios were constant (around 10), indicating that probably this ratio had little relation to bulk compositions. In respect of oxygen, only one line with binding energy ranging from 530.0 to 530.6 eV was observed for all the catalysts studied. The V/Mg surface atomic ratio was roughly close to that of the bulk of magnesium-rich samples. For catalysts with vanadia nominal contents greater than 50 wt.-%, a surface enrichment in magnesium was observed. After catalytic reaction, no appreciable changes were detected in the surface composition and binding energies of Mg, V and O elements of mixed oxides. Fig. 5 represents the effect of the V/Mg surface ratio on catalytic behaviour of VMg oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. One can see that the selectivity to propene at constant conversion does not depend on this parameter. Corma et al. [79] reported a parallelism between the selectivity and shift of the binding energy of surface oxygen; the higher the binding energy of the O ls line in a given sample, the higher its selectivity to propene. It means that the lower nucleophilicity of the oxygen species, the better the catalytic properties of VMg oxides for the oxidehydrogenation of propane. This correlation was established, however, within a very narrow range of changes of binding energy (0.6 eV) which hardly exceeded the limits of the measurement accuracy ( + 0.2 eV). To prove its validity, the measurements on samples with the oxygen nucleophilicity changing over a wider range are needed. This can be realized, for instance, by modifying VMgO catalysts with small amounts of acidic and/or basic additives. No clear trend appears when plotting the propane overall conversion versus the XPS V/Mg ratio. However, the conversion per surface area, which has been used 18 E.A. Mamedov, V.

Catalytic activity and selectivity of MgV oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane vs. V/Mg surface ratio. Symbols and reaction conditions as in Fig. 3. in ref. [ 23] as a measure of catalyst specific activity, increases with increasing V/ Mg surface ratio (Fig. 5b). This indicates that vanadium ions act as active sites for propane oxidation. For magnesium-rich samples, the rate of propane conversion has been found to pass through a maximum (Fig. 5c). The increase in activity at low V/Mg surface ratios has been associated [79] with the presence of isolated VO4 tetrahedra on the catalyst surface, and the decrease at higher V/Mg ratios with the appearance of condensed vanadium complexes which are suggested to be less active than the former species. Both these species, however, were not reported to be present on Mg-rich catalysts by other researchers [23,72,74]. Resuming the discussion of the VMgO system, one can state that mixed oxides are rather active and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane. Also, these catalysts are effective in similar reactions of 2-methylpro- pane [ 81 ], cyclohexane [ 82 ] and ethylbenzene [ 83 ]. Their catalytic performance depends strongly on the V/Mg ratio and preparation procedure which determine both surface and bulk composition. Different magnesium vanadate phases have been shown to exist in the body of VMgO catalysts. Although a number of inves- tigations have been carried out on this subject, no clear conclusion can be derived about their role in the overall catalytic behaviour. It should also be pointed out that E.A. Mamedov, V.

Ethane conversion (O) and selectivities to ethene ( * ), acetic acid (A) and carbon dioxide (i) vs. temperature on VP oxide catalyst [89]. the catalytic properties of separate phases seem to be dependent on the nature of the alkane and probably on the reagent composition. The results obtained in one case, therefore, cannot be generalized to other situations. These aspects should be analyzed and studied in much more detail. Little is known regarding the role of promoters and supports in modifying the catalytic properties of VMg oxides. It was reported [84], for instance, that the addition of Cr203 and MoO3 enhanced the activity of the catalyst, while TiO2 increased the selectivity in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of butane. As shown recently [ 85 ], the nature of the support may be one more variable controlling activity and selectivity of the VMg oxide catalysts. We hope that in forthcoming studies, more attention will be paid to these topics. 4.2. Vanadium phosphates Catalysts based on vanadium-phosphorus oxides, and in particular the vanadyl pyrophosphate phase, are well known to be highly active and selective in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [ 86]. In the presence of the (VO)2P207 catalyst, C5-C7 linear and branched alkanes also transform to maleic and phthalic anhydrides as mild oxidation products, with the total selectivity decreasing with the carbon atom number in the hydrocarbon [ 87]. In the mild oxidation of ethane over the same vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, the principal product was ethene, but its selectivity did not exceed 10% [87]. Considerably higher (up to 80%) selectivities for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane were obtained by Michalakos et al. [88]. It is not clear what caused the differences between the two investigations, since the catalysts were reported to be the pure (VO) 2P207 phase and tested under similar conditions. A more recent paper [89] using a VP oxide catalyst of a higher P/V ratio of 1.15 also reported high selectivities for ethene at high temperatures (Fig. 6). When decreasing the tem- perature, the selectivity to ethene decreased, and acetic acid and acetic anhydride appeared amidst the reaction products. At 543 K, their total selectivity was about 20 E.A. Mamedov. V. Cort~;s Corbe rdn / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) l~tO 100%, and no formation of ethene was observed. The addition of palladium to the catalyst increased the ethane conversion but lowered the selectivity to ethene, while the selectivity to oxygenated products was stable over a wide temperature range. It should be noted that the formation of acetic acid was not observed in the studies discussed above. Trying to explain this fact, a sensitivity of the VPO catalyst's reactivity to some factors, in particular the preparation method and operating con- ditions, was emphasized [90]. For instance, the catalyst treated with a hydroxyl- amine was found [ 89] to be more active than the untreated sample. The oxidation of propane over the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst produced mostly carbon oxides [87,88]. Less than 15% of the products were organic species, which comprised propene, ethene, acrolein, acrylic and acetic acid. The highest selectivity to propene of 12.5 % was obtained over the a-VOPO4 catalyst [ 91 ]. The performance of both catalysts can be improved by using a high alkane-to-oxygen ratio in the feed mixture in order to limit the overoxidation of the alkene [ 87 ], or by carrying out the reaction in the presence of ammonia which considerably decreases the rate of propane depletion [92]. In the latter case, propane can be oxidatively converted to propene with a selectivity of up to 75%, but a limited amount of acrylonitrile is also formed. As shown by Centi et al. [ 92 ], this selectivity can be achieved on the surface completely covered with chemisorbed ammonia, whereas the selectivities to acrylonitrile and carbon oxides are maximum at inter- mediate and very low surface coverages with adsorbed ammonia, respectively. These data clearly demonstrate that the catalytic behaviour of VP oxides depends not only on the presence of a particular surface configuration or structure but also on the nature of the surface changes induced by the adsorption of the reactants. As compared to the vanadium-phosphorus oxides, vanadium aluminophosphate (VAPO) catalysts displayed higher selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It has been shown [93] that highly crystalline VAPO-5 with the lowest vanadium content (0.4 wt.-%) was less active and more selective than both the worse crystallized VAPO-5 with higher vanadium content (1.6 wt.-%) and the impregnated catalyst with similar vanadium content (2.2 wt.-%). These differences have tentatively been attributed to the presence of isolated VO4 tetrahedra which dominated on the surface of the former catalyst. Taking into account that the best selectivities were characteristic of highly crystalline samples, including the very ALPO-5 whose initial selectivity was about 100%, one can suggest that this specific structure promoted the accessibility of propane to the dehydrogenation sites, thus contributing to the selectivity of VAPO catalysts. As for their total activity, it seems to be associated with the presence of the vanadium species. 4.3. Vanadium antimonates Mixed vanadium-antimony oxides are being studied extensively at present as catalysts for direct ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile [ 94-97 ]. It is generally accepted that propene is an intermediate in the reaction pathway from propane to E.A. Mamedov, V. CortOs Corber6n /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) l ~lO 21 acrylonitrile. The selectivity for propene formation is rather high (up to 70%) at low propane conversion over the vanadium-rich catalysts. With increase in con- version, the selectivity to propene drastically decreases due to both ammoxidation and combustion. These results have been obtained with the reaction mixture con- taining ammonia, which plays a complex role in ammoxidation reactions. Besides being a source for nitrogen, ammonia can also, as shown in ref. [98], reduce the catalyst and/or be adsorbed on the surface, and in this way change the catalytic behaviour. Adsorbed ammonia can increase the selectivity to products of mild oxidation by blocking the catalyst sites for weakly bound oxygen responsible for total oxidation. Furthermore, adsorbed ammonia species can act as basic sites for the hydrocarbon activation, thus enhancing the overall activity of the catalyst. These mean that the data on propane conversion to propene obtained in the presence of ammonia may be quite different from those obtained in its absence. Indeed, Centi et al. [99] detected only carbon oxides as products of propane oxidation over vanadium antimonate catalysts with V/Sb atomic ratios ranging from 0.6 to 1.3. Alumina-supported mixed oxide with a nominal V/Sb atomic ratio of 0.5 has been found [ 100] to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with a selectivity of 40-50%, which was much more dependent on the extent of ethane conversion than on the temperature in the range 673-773 K. The high overall activity and relatively low selectivity of this catalyst have been attributed to the strong oxidizing power of V205 which, according to the XRD and XPS data, predominantly covered its surface. The same catalyst exhibited dehydrogenation selectivities of ca. 60% in similar reactions of n-butane and isopentane [ 101 ]. 4.4. Vanadium-tin oxides Upon mixing vanadium and tin oxides and calcining at high temperatures, a formation of solid solutions and not of a chemical compound takes place [ 102,103 ]. Bordoni et al. [ 104] tested VxSnl_xO2 solid solutions (for 0.018 < x < 0.057) as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In this case, vanadium acted as a dopant for the tin oxide, modifying the specific reactivity of its centres. The highest improvement in activity was found for the sample with x = 0.034, while the activity of the catalyst with x = 0.018 was only slightly higher than that of pure SnO2. The selectivity to ethene also increased and was similar on all vanadium- containing samples, close to 40%, with total oxygen conversion (14% ethane conversion). Account taken of the results of EPR indications and catalysts treatment with the ammoniacal solution to remove the V5 oxide species, it was assumed that clustered V4 ions improved the catalytic behaviour of SnO2, while the phase of V5 + oxide had a detrimental effect. Higher selectivities to ethene ranging from 46 to 52% were reported for the alumina-supported vanadium-tin oxide with a V/Sn atomic ratio of 1.2 [ 100]. This catalyst consisted of a mixture of V205 and SnO2, though the existence of solid solutions was not excluded. A strong enrichment of the surface in vanadium 22 E.A. Mamedov, V.

No presence of the V4 + ions on the surface was detected. 4.5. Transition metal vanadates A series of 3d- and 4f-transition metal vanadates listed in Table 3 were tested as catalysts for butane oxidation [ 71,105,106]. Orthovanadates were the dominant phases present in all of the catalysts. No V205, but in some cases small amounts (less than 5%) of other vanadate phases, were detected. The surface composition as indicated by XPS showed a much wider variation between the samples. Nickel and copper orthovanadates appeared to be rich in vanadium, whereas chromium orthovanadate was deficient. The apparent surface non-stoichiometry did not cor- relate either with the total activity of catalysts or with their selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation. The latter was found to decrease with increasing the aqueous solution reduction potential of the component cation (Table 3), which had been used in the first approximation as a measure of its reducibility. Except for FeVO4, the aqueous reduction potential paralleled the onset temperature in the temperature- programmed reduction experiments: orthovanadates of more reducible component cations showed lower onset temperatures. On the other hand, no relationship between reducibility and activity of the catalysts was found. Explaining these results, Owen and Kung [ 106] postulated the existence of a selectivity-determining step of the reaction, much more affected by the ease of removal of lattice oxygen, presumably the M-O-V bridging oxygen, than the rate-limiting step. Catalytic properties of rare earth orthovanadates in the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of propane were studied in refs. [59,107]. The selectivity to propene was a weak function of temperature, and decreased with increasing conversion. The selec- tivities at a conversion of about 10% are presented in Table 4. They seem not to E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corberdn /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 Table 4 Propane conversions and dehydrogenation selectivities over rare earth orthovanadates at 673 K [ 59,107 ] 23 Catalyst Conversion (%) Selectivity (%) LaVO~ 8.3 22.0 PrVO~ 10.7 25.0 YbVO4b 10.0 26.0 ErVO4b 11.5 28.0 SmVO~ 11.0 29.0 CeVOb 8.5 37.0 TbVO~ 7.5 37.2 NdVO4b 8.4 42.2 Feed composition C3Hs/O2/inert = 30/15/55. b Feed composition C3Hs/Oz/inert = 10/20/70. correlate with the aqueous reduction potential of the rare earth metal cation. One would expect that if such a correlation existed, samarium and neodymium ortho- vanadates would show similar selectivities as they have the same reduction potential ( - 2.30 V). This was not the case. The Sm sample exhibited a considerably lower selectivity than the Nd catalyst did. Compared to other rare earth vanadates, NdVO4 was the most selective for propane dehydrogenation. In the reaction of butane (Table 3), it showed the highest dehydrogenation selectivity as well. Of the 4d-transition elements, niobium and molybdenum were used as a second component in the vanadium oxide catalyst. Although being in the same group of the periodic table as vanadium, niobium is, however, much more difficult to reduce. As a consequence, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, pure niobia dis- plays much lower activity but higher selectivity than bulk vanadia [ 108]. The activity of this material can be improved considerably by addition of vanadium, while the selectivity to propene can be maintained at the same high level of about 75% [ 109]. The addition of only 1 mol.-% V205 was sufficient to give an active and selective catalyst. XRD showed that this catalyst comprised only the Nb205 phase. The presence of the VNb9Oa5 phase, which was observed in samples con- taining more than 5 mol.-% V205, probably could not be detected because of its low concentration. Catalysts prepared via different methods had widely different activities per gram or per unit surface area of catalyst, while activities per vanadium concentrated in the surface were more or less constant. Based on this result and on the observation that the selectivities were different, Smits et al. [ 109] have sug- gested that the propane activation takes place on vanadium sites at the surface, but not all of them are similar in nature. The activity and selectivity of these sites have been proposed to depend on the number of neighbouring vanadium and niobium ions. Neighbouring vanadium ions provide additional activity, whereas neighbour- ing niobium ions improve the selectivity. Much lower dehydrogenation selectivity was observed on a vanadium-rich ( 83.3 mol.-% V205) catalyst in the oxidation of ethane. Even using a hydrocarbon-rich feed mixture, only 43% of the ethane converted was transformed to ethene at 663 24 E.A. Mamedov, V.

Various combinations of the vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been stud- ied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [ 110-112]. Although their activities were not easy to reproduce and different batches of catalyst showed somewhat different results, a V/Mo atomic ratio between 0.25 and 0.5 seems to be optimum. These compositions provided selectivities to ethene of up to 80% at low conver- sions. For the catalyst with a V/Mo ratio of 0.5, the selectivity was found to be essentially independent of both temperature and contact time [ 112]. The latter is a surprising result and suggests that the rate of ethene overoxidation to carbon oxides over vanadium-molybdenum catalysts is much lower than that over other vanadium-containing catalysts discussed above. XRD patterns obtained with VMoO catalysts showed the presence of several highly crystalline materials. Between 20 and 33 at.-% vanadium, the Mo4V6025 and Mo6V904o phases were the principal constituents of the mixed oxide, the remaining fraction being the MoO3 phase. By comparing the specific activities in ethane oxidehydrogenation and the XRD results obtained for various VMo oxide compositions, Thorsteinson et al. [ 111 ] arrived at the conclusion that both mixed oxide phases were not the most active in the composition, but the activity was somehow associated with a material giving a reflection at d/n = 0.400 nm. This phase, however, was not identified. As for the surface composition of VMo oxides, it was close to that of the bulk. 5. Multicomponent catalysts Many of the above-discussed binary oxides were used as bases for developing more effective multicomponent catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Two examples are presented in Table 5. As was shown in Section 3.3, mixed vanadium-antimony oxides are able to catalyze the oxidative conversion of ethane to ethene. The influence of various additives has been investigated in ref. [ 100]. It has been found that the addition of cobalt or bismuth deteriorated their catalytic performance, decreasing both the activity and selectivity. The presence of tin in the VSb oxide had no visible effect, E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corberdn /Applied Catal~'sis A: General 127 (1995) l~lO 25 whereas nickel significantly enhanced the selectivity to ethene. XRD and XPS characterization indicated that the surfaces of SnVSb and VSb catalysts were pre- dominantly covered with the vanadium pentoxide, which explains similar high overall activities and relatively low selectivities of these samples. In favour of this idea was a relationship between the relative proportion of vanadium at the surface and small variations in activity of SnVSb, SnV and VSb oxide catalysts. Such a relationship was not observed for NiVSb catalyst and its counterparts NiV and VSb, where no free V205 was detected in nickel-containing samples. The enhanced selectivity of the NiVSb oxide has been related [ 100] to the absence of both free vanadium and nickel oxides (the latter was present in less selective NiV catalyst), or/and to the presence of the NiSb206 phase. A more active and selective catalyst has been developed by adding niobium to the mixed vanadium-molybdenum oxide [113]. The pioneering work by Thor- steinson et al. [ 111 ] reported that MoVNb oxides were active at temperatures as low as 473 K. Furthermore, these catalysts were found to give selectivities to ethene of 100% at 10% conversion. These data, however, have not been confirmed by recent studies on the same system [ 110,112]. When niobium was added to the VMo oxide catalyst, the selectivity to ethene increased from 60 to 80% at 10% conversion which had been achieved at temperatures much higher than 559 K reported by Thorsteinson et al. Nevertheless, mixed MoVNb oxide is at present one of the best catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Its modifications listed in Table 5 provide high selectivities to ethene over a wide range of ethane conversions due to a relatively low reactivity with respect to the ethene oxidation to carbon oxides. The nature of active catalyst is still unresolved. Thorsteinson et al. correlated the specific activity of their catalysts with the intensity of an XRD line at d/n = 0.400 nm. They did not identify this oxide phase, but concluded that it arose from vanadium-containing material. Burch and Swarnakar [ 112] showed that the strong feature at 0.400 nm was consistent with other peaks which corresponded to a MoNb oxide phase, Mo3Nb20~l. And finally, Merzouki et al. [89] associated the ethene production with the presence of V- and Nb- substituted Mo~8052-1ike phases. So, further work is needed to elucidate which phase is important in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Nevertheless, the presence of niobium in the active and selective phase (or phases) cannot be ruled out. The effect of incorporating molybdenum oxide into magnesium orthovanadate has been studied by Harding et al. [ 116]. The butane oxidation data presented in Table 6 show that molybdenum-containing samples maintain the high dehydroge- nation selectivity of the magnesium orthovanadate. This result has been attributed to the similarities in structures of Mg3V208 and Mg2.sVMoO8 detected in modified catalysts. In both structures, vanadium is tetrahedrally coordinated and vanadium tetrahedra are isolated from one another. These properties of the magnesium ortho- vanadate crystal lattice have been suggested earlier [74] to be responsible for its catalytic behaviour. Over Mo-modified catalysts, the total dehydrogenation selec- 26 E.A. Mamedov, V.

Magnesium orthovanadate produced a higher proportion of butadiene than the molybdenum- containing samples, when compared at the same temperature and conversions. The ratio of the total 2-butene selectivity to the 1-butene selectivity was found to increase with the increase in MoO3 content of the catalysts. This trend as well as an increase in the production of cracked products have been related to the catalyst's increased acidity from the addition of molybdenum to the magnesium orthovanadate. Bhat- tacharyya et al. [84] claimed that the possession of sufficiently basic properties is a necessary condition for an effective catalyst for the production of dehydrogenated basic compounds. By using the activity promoter Cr203 and the selectivity promoter TiO2 together (Table 6), they developed a magnesium vanadate-based catalyst which provided a 36% total yield of dehydrogenated products under optimal con- ditions. Vanadium-antimony oxides modified with Bi, Sn or Ni, as is seen from Table 6, also display good catalytic properties in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n- butane. The behaviour of the most effective NiVSb catalyst significantly depends on the nature of the support pretreatment. It has been found [ 101 ] that the alumina pretreatment with a solution of hydrochloric acid enhanced both the butadiene yield and selectivity, and did not change the extent of butane conversion. These results could not be explained by textural or structural changes, since there were no differences in surface areas, pore volumes and phase compositions of the catalysts supported by variously treated y-alumina. At the same time, essential differences in the distribution of active components on the surface of the support were observed. In the calcined catalyst, vanadium-containing phases covered uniformly the inner surface, whereas the NiSb206 phase was mainly concentrated at the edge of the alumina sphere. The extent of such a 'chromatographic' effect, which appeared during the adsorption of active elements on alumina, depended on the nature of the support pretreatment; it was enhanced on the alumina treated with a HC1 solution. Rizayev et al. [ 101 ] have suggested that this kind of pretreatment leads to a E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corberdn / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 27 distribution of active phases in the support closer to optimum, thus providing a 22% yield of butadiene per single pass. When using a recycling technology, it increases to 30%. Similar results were obtained for oxidative conversion of isopen- tane to isoprene [101 ]. It is worth to note that the promoted VSb oxide catalysts listed in Table 6 are effective in oxidative dehydrogenations of ethylbenzene to styrene [ 117] and of ethanol to acetaldehyde [ 118] as well. Moreover, they cata- lyze the ammoxidation of alkylbenzenes through a 'dehydrogenation' mechanism, according to which nitrile is produced via amine- and imine-like intermediates [119]. To our knowledge, few multicomponent V-containing catalysts have been pro- posed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The main reason of this seems to be that most investigators believe a direct one-step propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile could be more competitive in comparison with a two-step process comprising a propane dehydrogenation unit and conventional propene ammoxi- dation technology. Anyway, we could find only two communications reporting the use of multicomponent oxide systems as catalysts for propane oxidehydrogenation. In one of them [ 120], an attempt has been made to improve the performance of the vanadium phosphate catalyst by adding tin or/and indium oxides. At 12% propane conversion, a propene selectivity of 35% has been achieved, which is considerably higher than that observed on a pure vanadyl pyrophosphate (see Section 3.2). In another paper [121], a solid ionic conductor Bi2Vo.9CuoAO5.35 with a layered structure has been tested in the same reaction. Using an oxygen-rich feed mixture, this catalyst gave a 2.6% conversion and a 42% selectivity to propene at 723 K. At higher temperatures and conversions, a dramatic decrease of selectivity was inevitable, and the catalyst appears to be better described as a total oxidation catalyst. Finishing the discussion of the V2Os-based catalysts, it should be noted that there was no goal to review all the catalysts known in the literature. The attention has been focused on publications reporting the data helpful for understanding the nature of active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and not on those cases describing only the catalytic results. 6. Summary 6.1. Reactivity of lower alkanes A precise comparison of the rates or conversions of different alkanes on a given catalyst is a difficult task because of the very different conditions under which the data were collected. Differences in preparations of the same catalyst may also complicate the interpretation of the reactivity data. Fortunately, there are papers reporting the results of oxidation of different alkanes under similar conditions. Although a hydrocarbon depletion in these publications has been characterized 28 E.A.

As is seen from Table 7, the ability of alkanes to be oxidized increases with the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon following the order C2 < C3 < C4 < C5, which parallels the order in decreasing strength of the weakest C-H bond of the molecule and the number of such bonds in the alkane molecule in the cases where this weakest bond strength is the same. A similar relationship has been obtained for total oxidation of C~-C6 alkanes over cuprous oxide (see Fig. 6 in ref. [ 123] ). These results are consistent with the proposal that the rate- limiting step is the breaking of the first C-H bond, which may be either heterolytic, with abstraction of a hydride ion and formation of a carbocation, or homolytic, with formation of an alkyl radical. The first mechanism has been proposed for dehydro- genations of propane and n-butane over vanadium phosphates [ 91,124 ], and can be expected to occur on other acidic catalysts. Homolytic dissociation of the C-H bond is more probable to take place on the surface of catalysts having well-defined redox properties, such as magnesium vanadates. In principle, there might occur a third type of C-H bond cleavage, heterolytic, with protonization of hydrogen and formation of a carbanion. In this case, however, one would expect the reactivity of the alkane to decrease with increasing length of its chain [ 98,123]. In contrast to the linear alkanes, no correlation between the total conversion and the number of carbon atoms in the molecule has been observed for the branched hydrocarbons [122]. The conversions on the (VO)2P207 catalyst tended to decrease with increasing substitution at carbon, being minimal for 2,2-dimethyl- propane and 2,2-dimethylbutane. It appears that the steric factors imposed by the substrate could also intervene in the overall oxidation mechanism suggesting the catalyst active sites to require a particular orientation of the hydrocarbon in order to activate the C-H bond [ 122 ]. The above considerations concern the overall conversion of alkanes which com- prises dehydrogenation, oxygenation and combustion reactions. The observed prod- uct distribution depends not only on the nature of the catalyst but also on the nature of the alkane. For instance, over the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst [77,87,88,122], alkenes were the only selective oxidation products from ethane and propane, whereas maleic and phthalic anhydrides were the predominant prod- ucts of selective oxidation of C4-C5 alkanes. Quite different products from propane E.A. Mamedov, V.

On the other hand, mono- and dialkenes were the dominant products of selective oxidation of C2-C4 alkanes, including 2-methylpropane, over magnesium orthovanadate. Herein, the dehydrogenation selectivity had a tendency to increase with the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule [88]. Using these data, we calculated the rates of oxidative dehydrogenation at conversions ranging from 5.2 to 8.4% and compared them with the energies of o~- or/3-hydrogen abstraction from C2-C4 alkanes. There were no correlations between these char- acteristics, but the reaction rate tended to increase with decreasing strength of both C-H bonds. These derivations are based, however, on a limited number of data obtained on only one catalyst and, therefore, cannot be generalized. Papers analyz- ing in detail an alkane reactivity-structure relation in the oxidehydrogenation reac- tion are absent in the literature. Meanwhile, this point becomes important if one assumes that the dehydrogenation reaction occurs on sites different from those for oxidation and combustion. 6. 2. Key reaction steps Catalytic oxidation of low-weight alkanes over vanadium-containing oxides produces mainly dehydrogenation and combustion products, although there are exceptions mentioned in the previous section. The selectivity for dehydrogenation changes only slightly with changes in temperature. This observation can be explained by the fact that within the error range, the apparent activation energies for dehydrogenation and combustion reactions do not differ strongly (Table 8). The effect of contact time on the performance of many catalysts indicates that at short residence times the dehydrogenation and combustion products are formed from alkane via parallel reactions [71,79,100,104,112]. With increasing alkane conversion, the selectivity to carbon dioxide increases at the expense of the selec- tivity to alkenes, implying the existence of consecutive reactions of these products at longer residence times. The selectivity to carbon monoxide also shows a trend to decrease at long contact times. These results favour a parallel-consecutive reac- tion network. 30 E.A. Mamedov, V.

Butane conversion ( a ), dehydrogenation selectivity ( b ), and rates of catalyst reduction (c) and reoxidation (d) at 673 K vs. the oxygen amount removed from 23%VzOJAlzO3 catalyst [56]. Some researchers [56,104,112] believe that the parallel reactions have a com- mon surface intermediate formed by activation of the alkane. As proposed by Morales and Lunsford [7] for a lithium-promoted magnesium oxide, it can be an alkyl radical generated on the surface of the catalyst. Then this species can either desorb into the gas phase and form there alkene by reacting with oxygen, or produce alkene via a surface alkoxide ion. According to Burch and Swarnakar [ 112], the relative contributions from these two routes to alkene formation are dependent on the reaction temperature as well as on the nature of the catalyst. At high temperatures ( > 900 K), one would expect a greater tendency for alkyl radicals to desorb; for reducible catalysts, particularly those based on transition metal oxides, there may be a greater tendency to form alkoxide ions. Since the catalysts under consideration contain vanadium and frequently other reducible oxides and most of them operate at relatively low temperatures (typically < 800 K), it seems very probable that the conversion of alkane to both alkene and carbon oxides occurs on the catalyst surface. This idea is supported by a linear relationship between the alkane conversion and the contact time observed for MgV [79] and NiVSb [100] oxide catalysts that suggests the absence of contributions from the heterogeneous-homogeneous reac- tions. So, alkane oxidation over V-containing oxides is proposed to be initiated and completed on the catalyst surface. The involvement of lattice oxygen in the reaction is indicated by the results of pulse experiments [56,112]. Some of these results presented in Fig. 7 show that even in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, alkane can be converted to alkene. With increasing the extent of catalyst reduction, the dehy- drogenation selectivity increases while the activity of the catalyst decreases. The E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corber(m/Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) l~tO 31 rates of catalyst reduction with alkane and reoxidation with oxygen also show strong dependencies on the extent of catalyst reduction. The steady state of the catalyst corresponds to the intersection of the reduction and reoxidation curves. At this point, the rates of these two processes are equal and should coincide with the rate of steady-state catalytic reaction if the latter occurs through a redox mechanism [ 125]. This was not the case in the experiments presented in Fig. 7. The rate of butane steady-state oxidation recalculated for the conditions of pulse tests was ca. 50 times lower than that corresponding to the intersection point. It seems that the degree of catalyst reduction estimated at the intersection of the reduction and reoxidation rate curves differed from the real extent of catalyst reduction under steady-state conditions, due to the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to the bulk. Anyway, oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes on V2Os-based catalysts appears to occur through a redox mechanism as many other reactions of selective oxidation [ 17]. A typical redox scheme can be thus suggested: kl Step 1. C,H2n + 2 + ZO -----) CnH2n + H20 + Z 2 k2 Step 2. Z + 02 ~ Z02 1 k3 Step 3. Z02 + Z ~ 2ZO 1 (I) 2C,,H2n + 2 ~- 02 = 2C,,H2~ + 2H20 where ZO and Z respectively represent an oxidized and a reduced site. k~ Is the rate constant of the reduction of ZO by alkane to give alkene while k2 and k3 are rate constants of the two-step oxidation of the reduced site Z by oxygen. The stoichio- metric numbers for each step are written on the right-hand side. Assuming step 3 to proceed much faster than the others (r3>> rl; r2) and a steady-state approximation for steps 1 and 2, the following equation can be obtained: 2klk2PlP2 i - (1) kiP1 + 2k2P2 where P~ and P2 are partial pressures of the alkane and oxygen in the reaction mixture. Eq. ( 1 ) can be transformed into a linear form: P2 1 P2 r 2k2+k-~l (2) which allows to check its validity experimentally. Rate Eq. (1) was reported in ref. [41] to fit well the experimental data on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over silica-supported vanadia. Fig. 8 dem- 32 E.A. Mamedov, V.

[ 1261. onstrates that this equation satisfactorily describes the kinetics of the same reaction on MoVNb oxide catalyst as well as the kinetics of propane oxidehydrogenation over A1PO4-supported vanadia. In Scheme (I), the oxygen activation is assumed to proceed in two steps: for- mation of incompletely reduced oxygen species ZO2 (Step 2) which might be a molecular radical ion O2, and its transformation into the lattice oxygen ZO ( Step 3). As the former is known to be very reactive with respect to the total oxidation [ 127], a high dehydrogenation selectivity can be achieved in their absence on the catalyst surface, i.e. r3 >> r2. Otherwise, Scheme (I) should be completed by the following step of alkane combustion: k4 fast Step4. C.H2.+2+ZO2 ~ (X) ~ nCO2+ (n+ 1)H20 where (X) is a surface intermediate of the carbonate-carboxylate type which rapidly decomposes to carbon oxides by interaction with either surface or gas-phase oxygen [ 123]. In this case, the dehydrogenation selectivity can be expressed as follows: S= rl (3) rl + r4 which, by using a method of steady-state concentrations, can be transformed into the expression: k3[Z] s = (4) k3[Z] --}- k4P1 A selectivity close to 100% could be achieved if k3[Z] >>k4P]. In addition to a high value of k3, the presence of reduced sites on the catalyst surface is needed to E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 33 obtain a good dehydrogenation selectivity. This is consistent with the results of pulse experiments which revealed a fairly large extent of catalyst reduction during the steady-state oxidation of butane [ 56]. The above discussion shows that the oxidehydrogenation reaction occurs with the participation of catalyst lattice oxygen. In this respect, an important question arises: What oxygen species in vanadate structures is involved in the dehydroge- nation? There are two hypotheses in the literature based on indirect observations. One of them suggests that the vanadyl oxygen (V=O) is involved [42,128,129], while another assumes that the oxygen in the V-O-V or V-O-M bridge participates in the selective oxidation [57,81,130]. As it is more electrophilic, double bonded oxygen seems to be responsible for the formation of oxygenated products as was proposed in refs. [ 15 ] and [ 123 ]. This idea is supported by the fact that a correlation between the rate of carbon dioxide production and the amount of V=O species was observed in butane oxidation with V2Os/TiOz catalysts [61 ]. According to Mich- alakos et al. [ 88 ], bridging oxygen is involved in the selectivity-determining step, which has been postulated to be the reaction of the alkyl species. As they see it, the selectivity is primarily determined by the competition between two processes: C- H bond breaking and C-O bond formation. Oxygen ions bridging two easily reduc- ible vanadium ions are believed to form C-O bonds easily, which would lead to the formation of oxygen-containing molecules. This tendency is expected to be lower and the dehydrogenation products to be dominant on catalysts which have no such reactive oxygen ions; for instance, they are absent in Mg3(VO4)2. This concept explains fairly well the increase in oxidehydrogenation selectivity when the reducibility of a M cation in the orthovanadate structure decreases [ 106], but fails to explain a contrary relationship between these characteristics established for MoVNb oxides [ 112] and for three Mg vanadate phases [76]. Oyama [42] has suggested the existence, on the surface of silica-supported vanadia, of two different intermediates for the selective and the unselective reaction pathways: the dehydrogenation would proceed through alkyl intermediates bonded to vanadium through oxygen atoms, whereas the combustion would result form the formation of intermediates with direct metal-carbon bonds. This concept based on two modes of alkane adsorption needs, however, experimental evidence. In partic- ular, an infrared spectroscopy study of alkane adsorbed species may throw more light on their role in the reaction. It is generally accepted that the rate-determining step is the breaking of the first C-H bond to form an adsorbed alkyl species. The results of studies of the effect of substituents on the reactivities of alkanes discussed in Section 5.1 suggest that the cleavage of the C-H bond may occur by a homolytic way with formation of an alkyl radical. Besides, the presence of Mn+O2- acid-base pairs on the catalyst surface may promote a heterolytic dissociation of that bond to give a carbanion as well. Sokolovskii [ 123] has analyzed in general terms the probabilities of these two modes of alkane activation on oxide catalysts. He has arrived at the conclusion that the heterolytic breaking of the C-H bond is preferable, since the radical sites 34 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 127 (1995) 1-40 needed for homolytic activation may cause also the appearance of radical oxygen species, which lead mostly to total oxidation. The alkyl anion has been shown [ 131 ] to be unstable and to have a tendency to release a hydride ion giving an alkene. Besides, by transfer of one electron to the catalyst, it can be transformed into a radical form which can be further dehydrogenated to alkene. This heterolytic activation of the alkane requires the presence of strong basic sites on the catalyst surface for abstraction of a proton. As these functions are usually performed by nucleophilic lattice oxygen, one would expect a correlation between the reaction rate and the nucleophilicity of catalyst surface oxygen. However, the comparison of O 1 s binding energies measured with XPS for different orthovanadates and their catalytic activities and selectivities in butane oxidehydrogenation has not revealed any relationship between these characteristics [ 106]. Nevertheless, a heterolytic splitting of the propane molecule to form a C3H7 ion has been proposed to interpret the results of catalytic and electrocatalytic oxidation of propane on magnesium vanadates [132]. In Section 2.5, the influence of the nature of the support on the vanadia reactivity in propane oxidehydrogenation has been interpreted based on the same assumption. Both these interpretations are speculative and not confirmed by direct experimental data. So, the question regarding the mechanism of alkane activation remains open. As it is of great importance for controlling catalytic behaviour, this problem deserves further thorough studies at a molecular level, using labelled compounds together with infrared spectroscopy for understanding more clearly the nature of active adsorbed species, investigating in detail the relationship between changes in the surface redox or acid-base properties and the reactivity of the catalyst, and analyz- ing the role of the reaction conditions in relation to this aspect. 6.3. Nature of active and selective sites Active sites for alkane oxidehydrogenation are generally acknowledged to be tetrahedral vanadium species, but the opinions regarding the detailed structure of the VO4 surroundings are different. Some researchers [79,88] relate the selectivity to alkenes to the presence of isolated VO4 tetrahedra which are possible on the surface of supported catalysts at low vanadium contents as well as in orthovana- dates, where all the oxygen ions are bridged between V and M ions. Others [64,72] are in favour of a pyrovanadate structure with V207 units that can be viewed as pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra. A schematic drawing of these sites is shown in Fig. 9. V207 units contain oxygen ions bridging two vanadium cations. According to Michalakos et al. [ 88], these oxygen ions are much more easily removed from the lattice than other oxygen ions, promoting the formation of oxygen-containing products. In contrast, as in isolated VO4 groups there are no oxygen ions bridging two vanadium ions, dehydrogenation is expected to be the predominant reaction. This model makes use of the concept of site isolation and the effect of metal- oxygen bond strength on the selectivity [ 17,56,133 ]. In principle, it can also explain E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1-40 35 @ a Fig. 9. Schematic drawing of the active sites: (a) VO4 unit in Mg3(VO4)2, and (b) V207 unit in Mg2V207. Open circles are O ions and filled circles are V ions [88]. the modifying effect of the component cation on vanadium ions as being that which induces the changes in the electronic state or the acid-base properties of the adsorp- tion sites through the bond V5 +-O2--Mn +. If Mn is less electronegative than V5 +, and if the ratio of Mn V5 is large, the adsorption site becomes more basic, and vice versa. The basic surface has been claimed [74,84] to facilitate the desorp- tion of alkenes, more basic as compared to alkanes, thus preventing them from oxidation to carbon oxides. Smits et al. [ 109 ] also assume that the active site in VNbO catalysts is a vanadium atom at the surface. However, they believe that the optimal activity and selectivity are given by a site having both vanadium and the other component metal as neigh- bours (V-O-V*-O-Nb). When the density of vanadium ions at the surface is too low, the chance of one vanadium site having a vanadium ion as a neighbour is small, and so the catalyst will be selective but not very active. From their point of view, the presence of vanadium in isolated tetrahedral sites is not sufficient for having an active and selective catalyst. At variance with Kung's model, V207 units are considered by Volta and co- workers [57,72] to be favourable for alkane oxidehydrogenation. Emphasizing the role of bridging V-O-V oxygen in the formation of water, they have suggested that this oxygen could be removed during the reaction, generating two V4cations. This gives rise to a dynamic model in which the local structure changes from the V207 unit to two edge-sharing square-based VO3 units [ 134]. The stabilization of the V4+ ions associated with oxygen vacancies is thus proposed to be responsible for the high dehydrogenation selectivity of the pyrovanadate structure. One would argue that after removing the most reactive oxygen bridging two vanadium ions, the restructured V207 unit would exhibit steady-state catalytic behaviour similar to that of the VO4 group. However, there is an experimental fact indicating that the catalytic properties of the VO4 and V207 units, both original and restructured, are indeed different. This is a considerably higher selectivity in pro- pane oxidehydrogenation of the magnesium pyrovanadate in comparison with the magnesium orthovanadate, established by different research groups [ 72,76 ]. Their selectivity changes in parallel with the reducibility, i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective. Similar results have been obtained for MoVNb oxide catalysts in ethane oxidehydrogenation [ 112 ]. If the catalytic reaction mechanism is as assumed through the redox cycle between V5 + and V4 + [ 72,74 ], there should 36 E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortds Corberdn /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 1~40 be a correlation between the catalytic property and the redox property of the VO4 and V207 units. Suggesting that a certain extent of reduction is needed for the selective dehydrogenation of the alkane, the selective site can be represented as a reduced V207 unit in which the oxygen bridging two vanadium ions is removed (V4 + []V4 + O2 -Mn + ). This site is able to activate an alkane molecule by abstract- ing one hydrogen atom with the oxygen bridging V4 + and M\" + cations, but not to hold an alkyl or adsorbed alkene very strongly due to the reduced electron-accepting property of the V4+ ion. Under the same reaction conditions, VO4 groups are expected to be reduced to a smaller extent as their oxygen ions are more difficultly removed than those in V207 units. An optimum extent of reduction and, hence, a good selectivity can be achieved either by carrying out the reaction under more severe conditions (higher temperature, larger alkane-to-oxygen ratio) or by using a more reactive alkane. The latter was the case in oxidation of C2-C4 alkanes on magnesium orthovanadate. Under similar conditions, the oxidehydrogenation selectivity increased with the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule, i.e., with its reactivity [88]. It should also be noted that at steady state, alumina- supported isolated VOx species was more reduced and more selective for oxidative dehydrogenation than a two-dimensional vanadia network [56], and V4+ ions appeared on the surface after the catalytic reaction [57 ]. The presence of V4 + was revealed in both orthovanadate and pyrovanadate of magnesium [ 23 ]. These facts indicate that along with the original surface architecture of vanadate species and their structural modifications by doping, the surface reconstruction induced by the catalytic reaction is of critical importance for understanding the real nature of the active surface. This phenomenon is widespread for oxidation catalysts [ 135 ]. However, very few data have been reported in the literature about this aspect of vanadium-containing catalysts. Most of them are based on results of catalyst characterizations before and after the catalytic reaction. Meanwhile, it is very important to understand how these surface modifications in the reaction environ- ment occur and how they depend on the reactant composition. For instance, as was proposed in Section 2.2, the water vapour may modify both the surface acidity and the local microstructure of the supported vanadia. More studies in this direction with use of in situ characterization techniques are necessary. 7. Concluding remarks The data discussed in this paper give evidence that VeOs-based catalysts exhibit a fairly high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Being by nature rather selective in these reactions, most of them accelerate, however, the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, reducing the dehydrogenation selectivity. The chal- lenge is now to suppress the overoxidation of dehydrogenated products. This can be done by modifying the catalyst with an appropriate additive, or/and by feeding in the reaction mixture water vapour or another substance able to block the catalyst E.A. Mamedov, V. Cortes Corberdn / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) l~lO 37 sites which adsorb oxygen weakly. The selectivity can be enhanced also by using an oxidant with a lower oxidizing power than that of the dioxygen. In this respect, it is intriguing to explore a possibility of using carbon dioxide instead of oxygen. As has been proposed in ref. [ 136], the acidic character of carbon dioxide requires to employ catalysts with moderate basic properties. Magnesium vanadates and many other reviewed catalysts meet the case. Another important question is the stability of the catalytic activity but it has strangely enough been missed in most publications. So, there is still considerable room for further improvement in per- formances of even the best vanadium-containing catalysts. It is clear that an improvement in the catalytic behaviour of known catalysts as well as a design of new ones require further development of our fundamental knowledge of the vanadium oxide system. Present literature data may be considered preliminary, and thorough studies on a series of topics are thought to be carried out. Above all, a much deeper investigation of the reaction dynamic mechanism and the correlation with the nature of the surface is necessary. Particular attention should be focused on an in situ evolution of the active surface and on the influence of surface reconstructions on the competitive pathways of reaction. The studies of the role of structural disorder and structural modifications by doping or preparing catalysts, and their relationships with the catalytic behaviour are to be continued as well. Such studies can open new approaches to designing effective catalysts and controlling their performance.

The present state of the art and outlooks E.A. Mamedov * V. Cortés Corberán Instituto de Catalisis y Petroleoquimica, C.S.I.C., Campus U.A.M. - Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain This review summarizes published data on catalytic performances of different vanadium-containing oxides, including unsupported and supported V2O5, vanadates, solid solutions and mixed phases, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2–C5 alkanes. The analysis of the structure-activity relationships shows that various species characterized by a different reactivity exist on the surface of these catalysts. There are some indications that tetrahedral vanadium species are the most favourable for alkane oxidehydrogenation. Its intrinsic activity seems to be largely dependent on the structure of the nearest surrounding and, therefore, can be modified by changing the nature and number of the neighbouring ions. Although the reaction mechanism is generally accepted to be through the redox cycle between V5+ and V4+, opposite relationships between catalyst activity/selectivity and reducibility have been established, even for the same catalytic systems. No clear interpretation regarding the mode of alkane activation can be derived from a survey of the literature. This and some other aspects of the reaction mechanism need further studies at a molecular level.

        "dc:description": "This review summarizes published data on catalytic performances of different vanadium-containing oxides, including unsupported and supported V2O5, vanadates, solid solutions and mixed phases, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2–C5 alkanes. The analysis of the structure-activity relationships shows that various species characterized by a different reactivity exist on the surface of these catalysts. There are some indications that tetrahedral vanadium species are the most favourable for alkane oxidehydrogenation. Its intrinsic activity seems to be largely dependent on the structure of the nearest surrounding and, therefore, can be modified by changing the nature and number of the neighbouring ions. Although the reaction mechanism is generally accepted to be through the redox cycle between V5+ and V4+, opposite relationships between catalyst activity/selectivity and reducibility have been established, even for the same catalytic systems. No clear interpretation regarding the mode of alkane activation can be derived from a survey of the literature. This and some other aspects of the reaction mechanism need further studies at a molecular level.",
