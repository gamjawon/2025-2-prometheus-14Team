Catalyst mixtures consisting of RE-USY blended with ZSM-5 at additive levels of 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 wt.-% were examined. Results indicate yields of light alkenes could be maximized by operating with large amounts of ZSM-5. For the particular gas oil used in this study, a maximum of light alkenes yield occurs at an additive level of about 25 wt.-%; other feeds can show a different response. At the 25 wt.-% additive level we observed maximum yield increases of about 150% in propene and isobutene, and 120% in n-butenes. At lower additive levels ( < 25 wt.-%), conversion of reactive gasoline-range species (mainly alkenes) is not complete. Above 25 wt.-%, conversion of these species is essentially complete, and the major effect of ZSM-5 is dilution of the base cracking catalyst with concomitant loss in overall conversion. The FCC naphtha octane (both RON and MON) also increased with additive level up to 25 wt.-%. We also observed an increase in ethylene yield, along with suppression of some undesirable products such as methane. In the presence of 25 wt.-% ZSM-5 additive, there were no significant shifts in bottoms (or HCO, heavy cycle oil) and light cycle oil (LCO) at constant conversion and only a slight decrease in coke yield at constant cat/oil ratio.

Introduction The use of ZSM-5 as a separate additive catalyst to improve research and motor octanes of gasoline produced via fluid catalytic (FCC) process is well known [ l- * Corresponding author.

ZSM-5 cracking additives were commercially introduced to the marketplace by Mobil in 1983 to boost gasoline research and motor octanes, as regulations phased out the use of lead. Since then, ZSM-5 has been used in over 120 fluid catalytic crackers worldwide to increase cracked gasoline research and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), as well as to increase feed to alkylation, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) units. When used in combination with zeolite Y in FCC, ZSM-5 cracks low octane gasoline range material formed from primary cracking with USY, to produce higher octane com- ponents. Generally, the octane gain from the ZSM-5 containing cracking catalyst is associated with FCC naphtha (C5 + ) yield decrease and corresponding higher yields of C3 and Ca alkenes (potential alkylate). In a typical commercial additive, the ZSM-5 zeolite crystals are mixed with an amorphous matrix material such as silica-alumina, which confers on the finished additive the physical properties required for an FCC catalyst. In general, the ZSM- 5 additive content in the unit inventory for these applications ranges from 0.8 to 12 wt.-% [ 2]. The improvements in Research and Motor octanes, and increase in light alkene yields with the addition of ZSM-5 to the FCC catalyst inventory have been previously reported [ 1-5 ]. Ultrastable Y (USY) FCC catalysts with lower Y frame- work alumina contents and hence lower unit cell sizes, tend to produce more light alkenes, mainly at the expense of gasoline alkanes [ 12 ]. ZSM-5, as separate particle additives, affords maximum flexibility in achieving target product specifications since they can be added routinely to the FCC units. The product distribution from modem FCC units generally fits well with current refinery needs. The volume and octane number of the gasoline are relatively high, and the light alkenes produced are upgraded via sulfuric or HF alkylation to high quality alkylate. However, as new gasoline regulations are implemented in the US as a result of the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990, ZSM-5 will take on an expanded role in FCC. The move towards reformulated gasoline with lower aro- matics and alkenes, increased RVP (Reid vapor pressure), and mandated oxygenate levels will push refiners to maximize alkylation production and to supplement oxygenate purchases with on-site etherification of available alkenes [ 13]. As refiners evaluate options to meet impending clean fuels specifications and more closely integrate with petrochemical operations, several questions come to mind with respect to ZSM-5 in FCC: How much C3 and Ca alkenes can be produced with ZSM-5 and what factors, in addition to ZSM-5 level, affect these yields? To address these issues, we conducted a pilot plant study using a once-through riser to determine at what ZSM-5 level LPG alkene yields are maximized. The study utilized a high activity RE-USY catalyst (laboratory equilibrated via steaming) in combi- nation with ZSM-5 blended at additive levels up to 75 wt.-%. This paper covers the effect of very high levels of ZSM-5 on product yield structure and octane enhancement. Y.G. Adewuyi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 121-133 123 2. Experimental The catalysts used in these experiments were a commercial RE-USY base FCC catalyst and a commercial ZSM-5 additive. The base RE-USY catalyst was severely steamed at 760 under 100% steam for 20 h to an activity of 69 as measured by Mobil's standard Fluid Activity Index (FAI). In the FAI activity test, a Light East Texas Gas Oil (LETGO) is cracked in a fixed fluidized bed of the catalyst at fixed operating conditions. FAI activity for a catalyst is defined as volume percent con- version of the LETGO feedstock (370 EP) where FAI conversion is defined as ( 100%-volume percent hydrocarbon boiling above 210). Typical steaming appa- ratus and FAI unit are described elsewhere [ 14,15]. The ZSM-5 additive was mildly steamed (at 788, 0 psig, 45% steam for 10 h) to an alpha (hexane cracking) activity of 4--5. The alpha test is described in detail elsewhere [ 16,17 ]. The properties of the steamed catalystsare given in Table 1. The base RE-USY catalyst and blends containing 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 wt.-% ZSM-5 additive levels were evaluated in an isothermal, bench scale, once-through riser pilot plant at about 538 average riser temperature. This type of reactor generally provides a more realistic yield structure than a fixed-bed MAT reactor. The small laboratory unit, designed to accommodate risers of various lengths, employed an 8.3 m, U-shaped riser and residence times of about 5 s for this work. Details of such a riser apparatus are described elsewhere [ 15]. The feedstock, Nigerian vacuum gas oil (VGO), was preheated to 37 I prior to mixing with the hot catalyst. The oil partial pressure and total reactor pressure were set at 20 psia and 35 psig ( 1 psi = 6.9 kPa), respectively. Properties of the feedstock are listed in Table 2. The reaction run times varied from 10 to 15 min, depending on the quantity of catalyst available and the cat./oil ratio desired. The cat./oil ratio is the weight ratio of catalysts to oil in the feed to the riser reactor. The long run times were necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of products for sample testing. The catalyst to oil ratios were controlled by choosing the proper catalyst orifice size and adjusting catalyst flow rates via hopper pressure. Runs were set at cat./oil ratios varying from 3 to 10 which resulted in total conversions of 45 to 74 wt.-% (46-76 vol.-%). Conver- sion is defined as 100 percent minus the cycle oil, where the cycle oil is considered to be the liquid in the effluent which boils at a higher temperature than the gasoline. The gasoline samples were distilled from the run syncrude to 238 in a TBP vacuum distillation column, which corresponds to about 196 at 90% ASTM end point. The gas product and C5- in liquid were analyzed by gas chromatography to provide a C1--C5 breakdown. The gasoline sample was also analyzed for research and motor octanes. A miniaturized octane engine is used in these tests, with a reported reproducibility of 0.75 for research octane [4]. Coke was determined by combustion of spent catalyst and analysis of offgas in a LECO carbon determinator (IR 212). 124 Y.G.

Results and discussion 3.1. Activity and product selectivity A means to determine the activity of a cracking catalyst is to plot 'crackability' (Cr) versus the cat./oil ratio. The crackability (or the second order conversion) is defined [18,19] as: Crackability = Conversion/( 100 - Conversion) ( 1 ) Table 2 Properties of Nigerian vacuum gas oil API gravity 20.3 Aniline point, 181.5 Bromine number 3.64 Refractive index at 70 1.4950 Sulfur, wt.-% 0.24 Hydrogen, wt.-% 12.5 Total nitrogen, wt.-% 0.18 Basic nitrogen, ppm 800 Conradson carbon, wt.-% 1.00 Alkanes, wt.-% 22.2 Naphthenes, wt.-% 32.6 Aromatics, wt.-% 45.2 Ni, ppm 3.6 V, ppm 0.30 Distillation, D1160 IBP, 318 5% 377 10 392 20 413 30 427 40 440 50 451 60 461 70 478 80 503 90 539 EP, 538 Y.G.

Crackability is a more linear measure of reaction severity than conversion for a reaction such as catalytic crack- ing, where apparent second-order kinetics describe the gasoil conversion [ 18,19 ]. As shown in Fig. 1, only a small activity loss due to dilution was seen with 12.5 and 25 wt.-% additive. However, the dilution effect becomes more significant as additive rates increase beyond 25 wt.-%. The activity data for the base catalyst and the different additive blends after interpolation of riser data at 7 cat./oil ratios is summarized in Table 3 between the 12.5 wt.-% and 25 wt.-% blends is minimal (0.8 wt.-%). However, at the 50 wt.-% additive level, the conversion loss almost doubles that at the 25 wt.-% ZSM-5 (7.5 vs. 4.1). A plot of coke yield on feed vs cat./oil is shown in Fig. 2. Table 3 also shows the typical coke yields of the base case and ZSM-5 containing mixtures at constant cat./oil ratio of 7. The relationship between coke yield and coke producing factor (or coke-conversion selectivity, kc) is given by: y=kc-Cr (2) where y is the coke yield and Cr is the crackability, as defined in Eq. 1.

The kc parameter, an indicator of catalytic coke formation, is perhaps the most critical parameter for catalyst screening and is discussed in detail in recent papers [ 18,19]. At fairly constant cat./oil ratio, ZSM-5 appears not to have significant effect on coke yield, up to the 25 wt.-% additive level. However, in the presence of 25 wt.-% additive or higher, ZSM-5 seems to reduce coke yields. The ZSM-5 additive also has no significant effect on both bottoms and LCO yields at fairly constant conversion at the 25 wt.-% additive level (Table 4). 3.2. Light gas and gasoline yields Figs. 3-8 illustrate the effects of high ZSM-5 additive levels (up to 75 wt.-% of catalyst inventory) on gasoline and light gas production.

Fig. 4, at a given cat./oil ratio or conversion, maximum Cf and C4 alkene yields (with incremental C3 <C4) are obtained at the 25 wt.-% level with no further increase above this level. The yields of C3 and Ca alkenes, and isobutene fraction in butenes, with increasing crackability are shown in Figs. 5-7 for base catalyst and the blends of base with 12.5, 25 and 50 wt.-% additive levels. As expected, the light gas yields increase with severity (defined as crackability) and with an additive level up to 25 wt.-%. However, the incremental yields of C7, C~ and iC4 are more dramatic, compared with iC4. As illustrated in Table 5, the yields of propylene and butenes show the largest increase in the LPG fractions. As shown in Fig. 7, the ratio of isobutene to butenes (iC4/C4, wt./wt.) remains fairly constant with crackability for the base case and the 12.5 and 25 wt.-% additive blends. The isobutene yield (as % of total butenes) at the 25 wt.-% additive level is about 41% of the total C4 alkenes compared with 31% for the base case.

Typical yields at constant conversion (69 wt.-%) after interpolation of results from runs close to 69% conversion are summarized in Table 4. The production of ethylene increased in the presence of ZSM-5, as illustrated in Fig. 8 and Table 5. Such an increase has also been observed in the literature at a lower additive level (2 wt.-% crystal) and attributed to residual matrix effect of the unsteamed ZSM-5 additive [6,7]. Unsteamed ZSM-5 used in diluted form within a porous inert matrix (at 2.2% ZSM-5 level) showed no change in dry gas (C~) and coke yields but a small increase in ethylene [8]. We found (Table 5) that with 25% ZSM-5 additive, the increase in ethylene yield was larger than the increase in overall C~, reflecting a decrease in methane and ethane production. 3.3.

If alkylation capacity is available, the potential alkylate yield more than compensates for the FCC gasoline loss, resulting in a significant net increase in gasoline plus alkylate. Plots of alkylate yields are plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of crackability. Assuming 100 percent recovery of propene and butene, the alkylate gasoline yields are estimated from the following relationships: Vol.-% gasoline alkylate: 1.78 vol.-% nC4 Vol.-% gasoline alkylate: 1.70 vol.-% nC3 Typical changes in FCC gasoline yields and octanes associated with the addition of ZSM-5 and alkylate gain at a given conversion are summarized in Table 5. As indicated in Table 5, ZSM-5 (at the 25 wt.-% additive level) increases the RON by 3.2 units, reduces FCC naphtha yield by 13 vol.-% at constant conversion (71.4 vol.-%) for a gasoline volume loss/octane number gain ratio of 4.1 vol.-% per RON, and allows 31.2 vol.-% alkylate to be made, compared to the base catalyst. A plot of RON versus gasoline selectivity is shown in Fig. 11. 3.4. Gasoline composition Table 6 illustrates a typical effects of high ZSM-5 additive levels on the distri- bution of hydrocarbons in the C5 + gasoline. In general, PIONA data indicate the gasoline loss (measured on feed basis) is due to significant shifts in isoalkanes, iso-alkenes, n-alkenes and n-alkanes. The level of ring alkanes (or saturated naph- thenes), ring alkenes (or unsaturated naphthenes) and aromatics remains essentially constant. The increase in aromatics generally observed (on gasoline basis) is due to concentration effects. Detailed gasoline component breakdown obtained from PIONA, PONA and gas chromatograph (GC) data will be presented in future publications. 132 Y.G, Adewuyi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 121-133 4. Conclusions This study has assessed the effects of adding high amounts of ZSM-5 to an RE- USY equilibrium catalyst in a FCC unit. Maximum light alkene yields occur when using approximately 25% ZSM-5 additive in the FCC inventory. Using Nigerian VGO and an RE-USY cracking catalyst, we observed yield increases of 150% in propene and isobutene, 120% in n-butenes, and 50% in isopentenes. Ethylene yield also increases and C~-C2 alkanes decrease, which is not generally observed with lower levels of ZSM-5 addition. In view of the feed effects discussed by Woolery et al. [ 1 ], the optimal level of ZSM-5 additive is probably feed-dependent; in general, a more paraffinic feed has higher potential for alkene make, and may require a higher level of ZSM-5 to maximize alkene production. The highly olefinic and iso-olefinic C3-C5 fraction enables effective coupling of FCC with etherification and alkylation processes to produce oxygenates and alky- late. The advantages of operating with large amounts of ZSM-5 also appear in cracked products other than C3 and Ca alkenes. These include low alkene levels and high octane values for the FCC gasoline, constant gasoline yields with tem- perature increase and suppression of undesirable products such as methane. In the future we envision that ZSM-5 will assist refiners to meet clean fuels requirements by maximizing levels of alkylate and ether production by optimizing FCC light alkene production. TAME and MTBE units become more economical due to increased capacity from higher iC4 and iC5 FCC yields. Alkylation capacity can be maximized by higher C3 and C4 yields. While raising the reaction temperature can also increase C3-C4 alkene yields, this typically leads to increased methane and butadiene makes, so adding ZSM-5 has advantages over simply increasing riser top temperature as a means of obtaining more C3-C4 alkenes.

The effect of the addition of high levels of ZSM-5 to steamed rare earth ultra-stabilized fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst has been studied in an isothermal, bench scale, once-through riser pilot plant. Catalyst mixtures consisting of RE-USY blended with ZSM-5 at additive levels of 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 wt.-% were examined. Results indicate yields of light alkenes could be maximized by operating with large amounts of ZSM-5. For the particular gas oil used in this study, a maximum of light alkenes yield occurs at an additive level of about 25 wt.-%; other feeds can show a different response. At the 25 wt.-% additive level we observed maximum yield increases of about 150% in propene and isobutene, and 120% in n-butenes. At lower additive levels (<25 wt.-%), conversion of reactive gasoline-range species (mainly alkenes) is not complete. Above 25 wt.-%, conversion of these species is essentially complete, and the major effect of ZSM-5 is dilution of the base cracking catalyst with concomitant loss in overall conversion. The FCC naphtha octane (both RON and MON) also increased with additive level up to 25 wt.-%. We also observed an increase in ethylene yield, along with suppression of some undesirable products such as methane. In the presence of 25 wt.-% ZSM-5 additive, there were no significant shifts in bottoms (or HCO, heavy cycle oil) and light cycle oil (LCO) at constant conversion and only a slight decrease in coke yield at constant cat/oil ratio.
