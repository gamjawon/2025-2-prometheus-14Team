N. NOGIN, E. A. PAUKSHTIS, A. V. PASHIS AND YU. A. RYNDIN Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 (U.S.S.R.) Summary FT-IR and XPS methods have been used to study the formation, the state of the components and the forms of CO adsorption on (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalysts prepared from organometallic precursors. The catalysts contain finely dispersed particles of metallic Pd coordinated with Pr3\"1' ions. A correlation between the ^ value for the Pd 3d level of modified Pd and its turnover number (TON) activity in CHgOH synthesis has been demon- strated. The high activity of promoted Pd seems to be due to activation of CO molecules on mixed active sites consisting of Pd atoms and lanthanide ions. Introduction As shown previously [1, 2], the turnover number (TON) activity of Pd/LagOa catalysts in the synthesis of methanol from CO and Hg is an order of magnitude greater than that of Pd/SiOg catalysts. When Pd is supported on other lanthanide oxides (Ln^Oy), it again demonstrates high activity towards CO hydrogenation to CH^ [3] and CF^OH [4]. In addition, Pd/Ln,Oy reveals the typical properties of a strong metal-support interaction (SM8I), i.e. low adsorption of CO and Hz [5]. We have reported that (Pd+Ln)/Si02 catalysts obtained from organometallic compounds are highly active towards CHgOH synthesis [6, 7], with Pr and Ho being the strongest promoters. In this work it was assumed that the change in the (Pd + Ln)/SiOa properties (as well as of Pd/Ln^Oy catalysts), which contrasts with the behaviour of Pd/SiOg, can be attributed to coordination of the Pd clusters over lanthanide surface ions. In an attempt to further verify this assumption, this paper describes the study of the formation, component states and the mode of CO activation on (Pd+Ln)/ SiOg catalysts (Ln = Pr, Ho) obtained from organometallic precursors. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 85 Experimental Silica gel (surface area, 250m2g~l) dehydrated ire vacua at 600 C was used as a support. Tris(isopropylcyclopentadienyl) complexes of Pr and Ho and allylpalladiumcyclopentadienyl were used as starting materials. (Pd+LnVSiOz catalysts were prepared in an inert atmosphere as described previously [6]: (i-C3H7CgH4)3Ln was chemisorbed from pentane on to SiOz, and the modified support treated in Hg at 300 C to remove organic ligands, following which C3H5PdC5H5 was chemisorbed from pentane onto the modified SiOg and the (Pd + Ln)/Si02 catalysts thus obtained reduced in Hg at 300 C. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS-113 V Fourier transform spectrometer at 1300 - 4000 cm\"1 with a resolution of 4 cm\"1. The spectra are presented here on an optical density scale after subtracting the background absorption. Powdered SiOg was pressed into discs of 15 mg cm\"2 density and placed in the IR cell to enable an in situ study of the various steps in the preparation of the (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalysts as well as the adsorption of CO on the sample obtained in the cell. XPS spectra were recorded on a VG ESCA-3 spectrometer using the A1K, line (E^ = 1486.6 eV). Values of E^ were calculated relative to the Si 2p support level for which E^ = 103.5 eV. The accuracy of such determinations of the binding energy was 0.2 eV, and the relative line intensity was 10%. Chemisorption measurements were carried out in a flow pulse installa- tion provided with a chromatographic analyser. After reduction at 300 C, the samples were evacuated at the same temperature to 10-3 Torr pressure, with studies of the adsorption ofHg, CO or Og and hydrogen titrations (HT) being performed at 25 C. CO hydrogenation was performed in a copper flow reactor at 250 C, 10 atm, CO:Hz = 1:2, space feed velocity 20 000 h~1 with a conversion of < 1% as previously described [6]. The activity and selectivity were determined after catalysis for 30 min. Results FT-IR study of the formation of (Pd -+- Pr^/SiOg Figure 1 illustrates the IR spectra of the products arising from the interaction of (i-C3H7CgH4)3Pr and C3H6PdC6H6 with the SiOg surface formed during the synthesis of the (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalyst. The spectrum of SiOz dehydrated at 600 C (spectrum 1) exhibits an intense absorption band at 3750 cm-1 corresponding to isolated OH groups. When SiOg is treated with a pentane solution of (i-C3H.,C5H4)3Pr, followed by removal of excess unreacted complex and subsequent drying, the resulting spectrum (2) in Fig. 1 indicates a drastic decrease in the intensity of the absorption band at 3750 cm-1 and the appearance of bands at 3083, 2963, 2940, 2875cm-1 and at 1460 and 1364 cm-1 [the latter not being 4000 3000 5, Cm-' Fig. 1. IR spectra of some steps in the synthesis of (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalysts. The following spectra are included in the figure: (1) SiO; dehydrated in vacua at 600 C; (2) SiO^ after treatment with a pentane solution of (i^H., 05114)3?^ washing and drying in uocuo; (3) sample (2) after treatment with Hg at 300 C; (4) sample (3) after treatment with a pentane solution of C3H5PdC5H6, washing and drying in vacua; (5) sample (4) after treatment with H; at 300 C. indicated in spectrum (2)]. It should be noted that the IR spectrum of the initial Pr complex is characterized by a broad range of absorption bands among which the most prominent are at 3060, 2940, 2900, 2850, 1450 and 1370 cm\"1. Consequently, the bands in spectrum (2) at 3000 cm\"1 may be attributed to stretching vibrations of the C H bonds and those at 1400 cm\"! to stretching vibrations of the C C bonds associated with the organic ligand arising from the supported Pr complex. When the above supported complex is treated with Hg at 300 C, the bands associated with the organic ligand virtually disappear from the IR spectrum [cf. spectrum (3), Fig. 1] while the intensity of the band at 3750 cm~1 remains unchanged. Further treatment of this reduced complex with a pentane solution of C3H5PdC5Hg, followed by removal of the unreacted Pd complex by solvent washing and drying in vacua gives spectrum (4) which reveals a number of bands at ca. 3000 cm-1, where those at 3069, 2980, 2940 and 2900 cm-1 may be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the C H bonds associated with the organic ligand [8]. The intense peak at 3750 cm~1 remains unchanged in this spectrum. The reduction of this (Pd+Pr)/Si02 catalyst with Ha at 300 C is accompanied by the disappearance of the absorption bands of the organic 87 ligands from the spectrum [spectrum (5), Fig. I], such treatment also failing to restore the intensity of the bands corresponding to hydroxyl groups. XPS study of the state of the components in supported (Pd + Pr)ISiO^ catalysts Table 1 lists the parameters of the XPS spectra of (Pd+Pr)/SiOz catalysts with different metal/promoter ratios. The binding energy of the Pd 3dg/2 level of catalyst 1 with a low Pd/Pr ratio has a value of 336.0 eV which is 0.8 eV higher than that of the bulk metal [9]. On increasing the metal/promoter ratio, the E^ value of Pd 3d^ decreases uniformly down to the value typical for bulk Pd, while the relative intensity of this line in the spectrum increases due to the enhanced Pd content. Prior to the addition of supported Pd, the E^, value of the Pr 3d level of Pr/SiOa is 933.8 eV, which is in good agreement with the value of Pr3-^ [10], while the Pr3d line in the spectrum contains a 'shake-up' satellite whose nature has already been discussed [10]. After the deposition ofPd the position of the Pr 3d line does not change significantly, although its relative intensity tends to decrease with increasing Pd/Pr ratio as occurs in catalysts 1-4. FT-IR study of CO adsorption on (Pd + Ln^/SiOa catalysts Figure 2 presents the spectra of CO adsorbed on (Pd + Pr)/Si02 cata- lysts as prepared in the IR cell. At low CO pressures, and hence low CO coverages (0co)> absorption bands appear at 2085 and 1927cm\"1 in the spectrum corresponding to the linear and bridged forms of CO adsorbed on Pd. In addition, a further band appears at 1620 cm\"1, the nature of which is discussed below. Increasing the CO pressure leads to an increase in the intensities of all three bands, together with high-frequency shifts of those bands corresponding the linear and bridged forms of CO. Figure 3 presents the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on (Pd + Ho)/Si02 catalysts. As in the (Pd + Pr)/Si02 case, at low CO pressures the spectrum exhibits absorption bands at 2073, 1919 and 1629 cm-1, respectively, their intensities increasing with increasing CO pressure. Figure 4 depicts the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on (Pd+Pr)/Si02 catalysts with different metal/promoter ratios.

As the Pd content in catalysts 1 - 4 increased, its dispersion as expressed by the fraction of surface atoms (PdJPdJ was found to decrease slightly from 0.75 to 0.58. From a comparison of the Pd dispersion to the amount of adsorbed Hg and CO, it is found that the degree of coverage of the Pd surface by these molecules (0co and By) is less than a half of the total available in (Pd + Pr)/ SiOg catalysts. The adsorptive properties of (Pd + Ho)/Si02 catalysts are in line with those for Pr-containing samples.

The (Pd+Pr)/Si02 activity decreases regularly with increasing metal/promoter ratio. Discussion Structure of the active sites on (Pd + Pr^/SiOz catalysts According to the FT-IR data (Fig. 1), chemisorption of (i-C3:H7C5H4)3Pr on silica gel results in a drastic decrease in absorption bands associated with the OH group concentration and the appearance of the spectral bands of the organic ligands which appear to arise from the interaction of the supported Pr complex with the OH groups on SiOg. Further treatment of Pr/SiO^ with hydrogen leads to the complete removal of these ligands, but the concentra- tion of OH groups fails to increase which indicates the retention of Pr ions associated with oxygen bonds. The data obtained enable the following scheme to be proposed for the interaction between the Pr complex and SiOg surface. n(^Si-OH) + PrRa ^ (^Si-0),. PrR3 _ + raRHf -H2-^ (^Si-0),. Pr + (3 - ?i)RHf (1) 300 C During the adsorption of C3Hi>PdCgH5 on the Pr/SiOz surface the concentration of OH groups does not change, which may indicate the interac- tion of the Pd complex with surface-coordinated, unsaturated Pr ions. The formation of adducts of the Pd complex with Pr ions will most likely promote the formation of mixed Pd-Pr sites on further catalyst reduction. According to XPS data, the average oxidation number of Pr in the reduced Pr/SiOg catalyst amounts to 3, which could serve as a reliable confirmation of eqn. (1). When Pd is supported on Pr/SiOg, the position of the Pr 3d line in the XPS spectrum remains virtually unchanged; however, if the Pd content is increased, the relative intensity of this line decreases by a value which exceeds the experimental uncertainty. This suggests a decrease in the surface PT3+ concentration which could be due to shielding by Pd clusters. From the hydrogen titration (HT) data, it can be shown that the average size of the Pd particles in (Pd + Ln)/Si02 does not exceed 15 A. The addition of Pr leads to a positive shift in the core Pd level, while the Pd electron deficiency increases with a decrease in the Pd/Pr ratio. Since the dispersion of Pd particles, decreases only slightly with this ratio, such a positive shift must be attributed to the interaction of Pd atoms with Pr3'1' cations rather than to a size effect. Taking into account all the data obtained, it is possible to propose the following model for the generation of an active site in the (Pd+Ln)/Si02 91 system involving coordination between Pd atoms (0) and surface lanthanide ions( ): ^ n (Model 1) This model provides an explanation for the reducing line intensity of Pr ions in the XPS spectra as a result of screening by Pd clusters, as well as an interpretation of the change in electronic, adsorptive and catalytic properties of Pd as a result of its interaction with Pr3'1' ions. Correlation between the electronic, adsorptive and catalytic properties of the modified Pd catalyst The above model also provides a further explanation (in addition to changes in the electronic properties of Pd) for the increase in Pd activity towards CO hydrogenation, i.e. activation of CO molecules over mixed Pd-Pr sites: \" \\ /^s /H Tr' ......Td^ -O^ (Model 2) The existence of such adsorption complexes has already been predicted theoretically [11]. The IR parameters of organometallic analogues of these complexes indicate that they possess absorption bands in the 1600 -1700 cm\"1 range of the spectrum [12]. In fact, during the adsorption of CO on Rh/La203, an additional band was observed at 1685 cm~1 and assigned to vibrations associated with CO molecules adsorbed on mixed sites occurring at the metal-support boundary [13]. Hence, the band at 1620cm\"1 observed in this work can be attributed to CO molecules adsorbed on heteroatomic Pd-Ln sites. There is a qualitative correlation between the intensity of the band at 1620 cm-1 and the activity of the (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalyst towards CO hydro- genation (Fig. 4, and Table 2). As the Pd/Pr ratio in catalysts 1 - 4 increases, the relative intensity of the band at 1620 cm-1 decreases in line with a decrease in activity of the catalyst towards methanol synthesis. Such experi- mental evidence provides a further confirmation of CO activation on mixed Pd-Pr sites as suggested by model 2 above. Figure 5 illustrates the dependence of turnover number (TON) activity and the E^ value of Pd 3d5/2 on the metal/promoter ratio. As the Pd/Pr ratio increases in (Pd + Pr)/Si02 catalysts with different compositions, TON and E^, decrease in a similar manner. This result indicates the high activity of electron-deficient Pd in CH30H synthesis, in good agreement with previous data [14]. The mechanism of metal interaction with lanthanide oxides Several models have been proposed in the literature to explain the unusual properties of an active metal (M) deposited on a lanthanide oxide, 92 \"o Fig. 5. (a) Turnover number (TON) activity in C^OH synthesis and (b) E,, value of Pd Sds/a plotted versus the metal/promoter ratio in (Pd + Pr)/SiO;i catalysts. i.e. (1) the formation of intermetallides of the type M^Ln, [15], (2) stabiliza- tion of the (100) crystallographic plane of Pd which is most active in CHaOH synthesis [16], (3) stabilization of electron-deficient Pd [14], and (4) the diffusion of LnO, particles on to the metal surface [5]. Our results provide a critical analysis of these models. Both this paper and those published previously [6, 7] demonstrate that the adsorptive and catalytic properties of (Pd + Pr)/Si02 are similar to those of Pd supported on bulk lanthanide oxides. Both catalytic systems actually differ from the Pd/SiOg system in exhibiting a low coverage of the Pd surface by adsorbed Hg and CO, low activity towards benzene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenol- ysis, and high activity in CHsOH synthesis. Thus it has been assumed that the active sites are essentially similar in both catalytic systems [6, 7]. The XPS data indicate that Pr in the (Pd + Pr)/Si02 system exists in an ionic form which excludes the formation of intermetallides. Furthermore, the high dispersion of Pd in (Pd + Ln)/Si02 appears to hinder favourable expo- sure of one of the Pd crystal planes. The correlation between the electronic and catalytic properties of Pd provides good evidence for a definite role for electron-positive Pd formed by the interaction of Pd clusters with Ln\"-^ ions in enhancing catalyst activity in CHaOH synthesis. However, we wish to submit further that the determin- ing factor is the formation of mixed heteroatomic sites (model 2) possessing high activity towards CO hydrogenation to CHaOH. Hence, it may be con- cluded that the formation of such heteroatomic sites is feasible within the framework of a model which assumes diffusion of suboxide lanthanide parti- cles to the surface of the active metal [5]. 93 Acknowledgement The authors wish to thank Dr Yu.
