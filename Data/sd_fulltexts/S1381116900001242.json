Fax: +7-383-234-3056 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy has been used to study the surface aluminium compounds formed upon interaction of the supported TiCl4/donor/MgCl2 catalyst with AlEt3 in the presence or absence of the external donor. Similarly with the catalyst without any donors [A.G. Potapov, V.V. Terskikh, V.A. Zakharov, G.D. Bukatov, J. Mol. Catal. A: Chem., 145 (1999) 147], the AlEt2Cl formed adsorbs on the catalyst surface. It was found that there is no influence of internal and/or external donors on the state of aluminium in adsorbed AlEt2Cl in spite of a decrease of the aluminium content in the presence of external donor. Keywords 27Al MAS NMR Supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts Propylene polymerization 1 Introduction We have studied recently by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy the state of surface aluminium complexes formed upon interaction of AlEt3 (co-catalyst) with the supported catalyst TiCl4/MgCl2 in the absence of any donor [1]. It was found that the main surface compound of aluminium in this case is likely to be AlEt2Cl, the major part of aluminium being in sixfold coordination. In addition, adsorbed AlEt2Cl was found to block a significant part of the titanium ions on the catalyst surface [1]. The TiCl4/MgCl2 catalyst itself has low stereospecificity for the polymerization of propylene. To improve the stereospecificity of the catalyst, internal donors (ID, added during catalyst preparation) and external donors (ED, added during polymerization) are used. The treatment of the catalyst containing ID by AlEt3 co-catalyst results in a decrease of the ID content and in the appearance of aluminium in the catalyst [2,3]. When presented ED replaces ID in the catalyst and content of aluminium in the catalyst decreases. This decrease probably indicates that ED competes with AlEt3 for the catalyst surface [3]. One can, thus, propose that the presence of ID and ED in stereospecific catalytic systems for the polymerization of propylene influences the state and/or concentration of surface aluminium-containing compounds. The aim of the present work is to study by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy the influence of ID and ED on the state and concentration of the adsorbed Al complexes. 2 Experimental The titanium–magnesium catalysts (A) and (B) with composition of TiCl4/ID/MgCl2 (where ID is dibutylphthalate (DBP) for catalyst (A) and 2,2-diisobutyl-1,3-dimethoxypropane (DIBDMP) for catalyst (B)) were obtained as follows. Catalyst (A) was prepared via the interaction of magnesium ethoxide with a mixture of TiCl4 and PhCl (molar ratio 1:1) in the presence of DBP at 115°C with subsequent washing by heptane. The catalyst contained 2.0 wt.% of Ti and 19.8 wt.% of DBP. Catalyst (B) was obtained from MgCl2·3ROH as described earlier [4]. Catalyst (B) contained 2.9 wt.% of Ti and 13.2 wt.% of DIBDMP. Both catalysts were treated as follows. The solvent (heptane) was loaded into a glass reactor under Ar atmosphere and an AlEt3 solution in heptane was then introduced to attain AlEt3 concentration of 20 or 30 mmol/l, and a molar Al/Ti ratio of 6 or 10 (see Table 1 ). Propyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS) was added to achieve a molar Si/Al ratio of 0.2 or 0.05 (see Table 1). Weighted portions of catalysts were introduced into the reactor under stirring and the reaction was effected at ambient temperature for 1 h. The obtained samples were then washed several times with heptane and dried in vacuum. The contents of Ti and Al in the samples were determined by AES-ICP technique (atomic-emission spectrometry-inductively coupled plasma). The procedure of the 27Al MAS NMR measurements was described before [5]. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (27Al resonance frequency of 104.5 MHz) with a pulse width of 2 μs (π/12) and 0.2 s delay between pulses. Typical number of accumulations was ca. 200,000–220,000 with an exception made for sample 2, when 40,000 FIDs were accumulated. 3 Results and discussion Table 1 shows the conditions used in the sample preparations and gives the Ti and Al contents of the studied catalysts. The 27Al NMR MAS spectra of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . Treatment of catalyst (A) by AlEt3 with a molar ratio Al/Ti=6 did not change the catalyst composition with respect to the Ti and donor contents (Table 1, sample 1). The 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of this sample (Fig. 1-1) consists of the superposition of three lines: two lines of comparable intensities at ca. 5 ppm and ca. 70 ppm and a smaller line at 35 ppm. This spectrum arises from AlEt2Cl adsorbed at the catalyst surface [1]. The attribution of these lines in such spectra was discussed previously [5], the lines at 5 and 35 ppm correspond to Al in sixfold coordination and the line at 70 ppm to Al in fivefold coordination. As the molar Al/Ti ratio is close to 1 in sample 1 (Table 1) and since there is no significant removal of ID from the surface of the catalyst, the AlEt2Cl, which is formed, adsorbs mainly on TiCl3 formed at the reduction of TiCl4. This result is supported by the data obtained for catalyst (B) containing the ID which is not removable by AlEt3 (Table 1, sample 2; Fig. 1-2). It is interesting to note that the quantity of Lewis acidic sites in this sample (as measured by adsorption of stable nitroxyl radical) was about a quarter of the titanium content [4]. This value is close to the molar content of adsorbed AlEt2Cl in which Al is fivefold coordinated (ca. 40%, as measured by NMR-spectrum deconvolution, Fig. 1-2) and accounts for ca. 30% of the total titanium content. This species is probably responsible for the Lewis acidic properties. The treatment of catalyst (A) by AlEt3 at molar ratio Al/Ti of 10 (sample 3) resulted in a decrease of both the titanium and donor contents in the catalyst and in the incorporation of a larger amount of aluminium-containing compounds relative to sample 1. The 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 1-3) of this catalyst resembles the spectra of samples 1 and 2 in spite of the significant changes of the composition. The molar aluminium content is twice higher than the titanium content although the titanium content is only decreased by 25% (Table 1, sample 3). It is interesting to note that the content of aluminium (0.63 mmol/g) exceeds that of titanium (0.32 mmol/g) by a quantity of removed TiCl4 (0.10 mmol/g) and ID (0.19 mmol/g)). Perhaps, the formed AlEt2Cl adsorbs both on TiCl3 and MgCl2 surface centres which are formed after removal of some titanium compounds and of the ID by reaction with AlEt3. Similar results were obtained in Ref. [3]: the aluminium content in the catalyst treated by AlEt3 increased in parallel with a decrease of ID content to reach the same or higher Al/Ti ratio compared to those of the catalyst without ID [2]. We conclude, therefore, that in the case of the catalyst containing an ID, the states of aluminium in the surface Al complexes are similar to those observed in the catalyst without ID. The higher intensity of the line at 70 ppm (Fig. 1-1) relative to that for the catalyst TiCl4/MgCl2 reported in Ref. [1] seems to be accounted for by the lower Al/Ti ratio used during the preparation of sample 1. As it was shown in Ref. [1], an excess of AlEt3 resulted in the removal of AlEt2Cl complexes in which Al is in fivefold coordination. The introduction of ED at the treatment of the catalyst (A) by AlEt3 did not change noticeably the composition of the catalyst (Table 1, samples 4 and 1). The Al/Ti molar ratio of the catalyst decreases only by ∼20%. A small decrease of donor content (wt.%) can be accounted for by the replacement of DBP by PTMS which has a smaller molecular weight. The 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of this sample (Fig. 1-4) differs from the spectrum of sample 1 only by a somewhat higher intensity of the line at 70 ppm. It may be that the effective concentration of AlEt3 in this preparation was lower (compared with sample 1) because of its complexation with PTMS, thus decreasing the removal of AlEt2Cl (with Al in fivefold coordination) from the catalyst surface. Sample 5, obtained by AlEt3 treatment of catalyst (A) with subsequent addition of PTMS, did not differ noticeably by its composition from sample 1 (Table 1). The addition of PTMS does not influence the state of Al in the surface complexes: the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of this sample (Fig. 1-5) is similar to that obtained for sample 1 (Fig. 1-1). Thus, AlEt2Cl also interacts with TiCl3 species formed by the reduction of TiCl4. Therefore, it is most likely that the surface aluminium compounds formed by the interaction of the catalyst with AlEt3 are inert with respect to the ED used. Sample 6 was prepared from catalyst (A) by adding of PTMS, under conditions similar to that used for sample 3 (Table 1). In these conditions, there are marked changes in the composition of the initial catalyst (compare sample 6 to samples 1 and 4). The content of Al and the Al/Ti molar ratio are noticeably lower than the corresponding values for sample 3. Nevertheless, the state of the surface Al species in samples 6 and 3 remains the same (Fig. 1-6). Therefore, we conclude that an ED does not influence the state of aluminium, but can decrease the aluminium content as a result of its adsorption on MgCl2 centres which are formed upon removal of the internal donor by AlEt3. 4 Conclusions The presence of ID and ED in stereospecific catalytic systems for the polymerization of propylene does not influence the state of the surface aluminium-containing compounds (AlEt2Cl) formed at the treatment of the catalyst by AlEt3. The ED does not remove AlEt2Cl from the catalyst surface but competes with the aluminium compounds for the MgCl2 adsorption centres which become available after the removal of the ID by AlEt3.
