FIN-20500 Abo, Finland Received 22 September 1995; revised 30 November 1995; accepted 1 December 1995 Abstract K-ZSM-22 zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 53 have been synthesized by means of the hydrothermal synthesis method using 1,6-diaminohexane as the templating agent. The H-ZSM-22, Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts have been prepared and characterised by X-ray powder diffraction (Philips pw 1830), scanning electron microscopy (Leica Cambridge Stereoscan 360), nitrogen adsorption (Carlo Erba Instruments), X-ray fluorescence (Outokumpu-8000) and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. The synthesised ZSM-22 zeolite was highly crystalline and free of amorphous material. The TPD of ammonia profiles revealed that the H-ZSM-22, Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 were acidic and consisted of Br~nsted and Lewis acid sites. The catalytic activity were investigated for the conversion of n-butane to aromatic hydrocar- bons over H-ZSM-22, Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts. Further, the effect of tempera- ture and the space velocity on the conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons were studied. The selectivity to aromatics was higher for Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 than for H-ZSM-22. The effect of time on stream on n-butane conversion and the selectivity to aromatics was studied at 803 K for 4.5 h. Keywords: Zeolites; Synthesis; ZSM-22; n-Butane; Aromatization 1. Introduction The metal modified and proton form zeolites are important catalysts in many chemical reactions such as cracking, aromatic alkylation, aromatization, dehy- drogenation and isomerization.

Kumar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 189-199 dependent upon the interaction between the metal and zeolite and the structure of the zeolite. ZSM-22 belongs to the group of medium pore zeolites which includes ZSM-5, ZSM-I 1, ZSM-35 and which consists of linear l-dimensional 10-membered ring openings of the 5.5 4.5 A channel system [1,2]. The ZSM-22 zeolite does not have channel intersections similar to those found in ZSM-5, ZSM-11 and ZSM-35, however, the ZSM-22 zeolite has been deter- mined to be of the TON structure type and have framework topology similar to that found in theta 1, ISI-1, and NU-10 zeolites [3]. The framework topology of ZSM-22 is composed of 5, 6, and 10 rings. The 10-ring channels of ZSM-22 are smaller than those of ZSM-5, ZSM-35 and ZSM-11 [4]. The acidic properties and shape selectivity of ZSM-22 have been investigated by Borade and Stefan et al. [4,5]. Some significant reactions studied over the ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts are catalytic dewaxing [6], xylene isomerization [7], alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons [8] and 1-butene isomerization [9]. Conversion of light alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons is an important reaction both from an academic and from an industrial point of view. Ga-, Zn- and Pt-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts have been the object of intensive study for this reaction [10-13]. The ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts have been mentioned in the patent literature for the aromatization reaction, however, there is no detailed study of this reaction over Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 in the literature available. It is of great value that the aromatization of light alkanes over Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 zeolite be evaluated. The aim of the present work is to prepare H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22 and study the conversion of n-butane to aromatic hydrocar- bons over these catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts The ZSM-22 zeolite with a Si/A1 ratio of 53 was synthesized in accordance with the method employed in [5] with some modifications. Solution A was prepared by dissolving Ludox AS-40 in distilled water. Solution B was prepared by dissolving A12(SO4)3 18H20 (Merck) in distilled water and by adding KOH (Merck) and 1,6-diaminohexane (Fluka) to it. The solutions were stirred for 15 rain after which solution B was transferred to solution A with vigorous stirring. A white gel was immediately formed and it was stirred for 30 rain. The gel was then transferred to a PTFE cup contained in an autoclave. The autoclaves were mounted on a moving shaft in an oven which was heated to 433 K. The autoclaves were rotated for 3 days in the oven. When the reaction was completed the autoclaves were quenched in cold water. The content of the autoclaves was transferred to a filtration apparatus, where it was washed to neutral pH, filtered and dried at 383 K for 12 h. The calcination was carried out N.

The synthesized K-ZSM-22 was ion-exchanged with 1 M NH4C1 for 48 h, washed free of chloride ions and dried for 12 h at 383 K to obtain NH4-ZSM-22. The NH4-ZSM-22 was deammoniated at 823 K to obtain H-ZSM-22. The Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-22 was obtained by repeated ion-exchange of H-ZSM-22 with the aqueous solutions of Ga(NO3)3.9H20 and Zn(NO3)2.6H20 for 72 h at 353 K. The ion-exchanged ZSM-22 with Ga and Zn was washed with distilled water, filtered and dried at 393 K for 10 h and pretreated with air for 3 h at 773 K. 2.2. Characterization of the catalysts The parent zeolite K-ZSM-22 and H-, Zn- and Ga-modified ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts were characterised with X-ray powder diffraction (Philips pw 1830) using Cu K o~ radiation. The X-ray diffraction patterns obtained were similar to those found in the literature [14]. It has been reported in the literature [1,9] that a small phase impurity of cristobalite occurred in the synthesized K-ZSM-22 zeolite, however, this impurity was not detected by X-ray powder diffraction or by scanning electron microscope analysis in our K-ZSM-22 samples (Fig. 1). The modification of the parent zeolite, K-ZSM-22, by H, Zn and Ga did not affect the crystal structure of the ZSM-22 zeolite and X-ray diffraction patterns for modified zeolites were the same as those of the parent K-ZSM-22 zeolite. The scanning electron microscope (Leica Cambridge Stereoscan 360) was used to investigate the morphology of the K-ZSM-22, H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22 zeolites. The samples were prepared for SEM analysis by 192 N. Kumar et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 189-199 Fig. 2. Scanning electron micrograph of K-ZSM-22. gold coating. The crystal shape of the ZSM-22 zeolites was that of a single needle or a conglomerate of needles (Fig. 2). The average width of the needle was 421 nm and the average length was 2.96/zm. The micrographs produced by the scanning electron microscope also confirmed that there was no amorphous material present in the ZSM-22 zeolites. The specific surface area of the catalysts was determined by nitrogen adsorption (Carlo Erba Instruments) using liquid nitrogen. The zeolite samples of 0.2 g were outgassed at 573 K for 3 h prior to the surface area measurements and the Dubinin method was used to calculate the surface area. The surface area was found to be 330, 340 and 335 m2/g for H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22, respectively. The isotherms obtained for all three zeolite cata- lysts were typical of microporous material. The acidity of the H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22 zeolites was investigated by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD) using an on-line mass spectrometer (Carlo Erba Instruments) equipped with a QTMD detector. The TPD was carried out in a micro reactor made of pyrex with 0.16 g of the catalyst at atmospheric pressure. All gases were passed downflow through the catalyst bed and the flow of gases was regulated with flow controllers (Brooks). The catalyst was evacuated in a flow of highly pure helium (99.999%) at 773 K for 60 rain and cooled to 373 K. The adsorption of ammonia was carried out at 373 K for 45 rain followed by flushing with He for 50 rain. The desorption of ammonia was carried out from 373 K to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K and using helium as the carrier gas. The signals of AMU 17 (ammonia), N.

Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia for H-ZSM-22. 14 (nitrogen) and 18 (water) were continuously collected and monitored by the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with an ammonia/helium mixture and the amount of ammonia desorbed was calculated from TPD measurements. The peak maxima in the ammonia evolution profiles were observed at 623 K and 723 K for all three catalysts (Fig. 3). The peak obtained at high temperature was due to the desorption of ammonia from BrCnsted acid sites while the low temperature peak is due to the Lewis acid sites. The Br~nsted acid sites are related to the proton belonging to the structural OH groups of the ZSM-22, while Lewis acid sites are related to incompletely coordinated A1 species. The TPD of ammonia revealed that in all the three catalysts both Lewis acid and BrOnsted acid sites were present and the TPD curves were very similar to those found for ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. It was also observed that Zn- and Ga-modified ZSM-22 exhibited lower acidity than H-ZSM-22, which could be the result of replacement of protons in the zeolite by Ga; some authors [15] have drawn similar conclusions with reference to the ZSM-5 catalyst. The acidity profile of H-ZSM-22 obtained in this study was similar to that reported previously by Borade et al. [4]. 2.3. Catalyst testing The catalytic activity tests of H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22 catalysts for the conversion of n-butane into aromatic hydrocarbons were performed in a pyrex fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The amount of catalyst used for catalytic testing was 0.5 g and the temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored with a thermocouple connected to a temperature regulator. The gas mixture containing 20% n-butane and 80% nitrogen was fed to the reactor with a WHSV of 2.5 h-l. The pure n-butane (99.9%) was obtained from AGA and was preheated at 340 K prior to mixing with the 194 N. Kumar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 189-199 nitrogen flow. The reactor product stream was fed to the gas chromatographs via steel tubing and a valve, which were heated to 373 K so that all products would remain in the gas phase. All of the reaction products with exception of hydrogen were analysed on-line by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3700), equipped with a 50 m 0.32 mm i.d. fused-silica PLOT AI203-KC1 capillary column and a FID detector. The hydrogen was analysed by another gas chromatograph (Mikrolab 82-22) linked with a 1.3 m 0.3 mm i.d. molecular sieve packed column and thermal conducting detector. The packed column was backflushed after the hydrogen analysis to avoid column clogging by high molecular weight com- pounds. Prior to the catalytic activity measurements, thermal cracking tests for n-butane were performed at 803 K and it was observed that the effects of thermal cracking was negligible. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of temperature on the conversion of n-butane and on the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over H-ZSM-22, Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 The reaction was carried out at temperatures of 743, 773 and 803 K with a space velocity of 2.5 h-i. Prior to catalytic activity testing, catalysts were pretreated in dry air for 3 h and in a flow of nitrogen for 30 rain. As can be seen in (Fig. 4) the conversion of n-butane increased with increasing temperature over all three catalysts. The gaseous products formed were hydrogen, methane, 60 S0 40 3o f, 20 10 0 Temperature (K) Fig. 4.

The formation of hydrogen, ethane, ethene and iso-butane was higher as compared to other gaseous products. The Ga- and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts exhibited higher n-butane conversion than over the H-ZSM-22 catalyst at all three temperatures. The selectivity to aromatic hydro- carbons increased with increasing temperatures (Fig. 5) and was higher for Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-22 than for the H-ZSM-22 catalyst. The aromatic hydro- carbons formed were benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethyl benzene. The toluene accounted for 50% of the total aromatic hydrocarbons. The modification of H-ZSM-22 with Ga and Zn generates active sites on the external surface and in the channels of the ZSM-22 zeolite, which are responsible for the higher conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons. The main gaseous products formed over H-ZSM-22 were methane, ethane, ethene and propene. The formation of methane, ethane, and ethene decreased and that of propene and isomers of butene increased over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts. The probable reason for the decrease in the methane and ethane formations could be decline in number of BrCnsted acid sites of Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22. The decrease in the acidity of Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-22 was confirmed by the TPD of ammonia acidity test. The product distributions indicate that the probable mechanism of aromatic forma- tion over these catalysts was the dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ga or Zn forming alkenes and hydrogen, followed by oligomerisation of olefins to higher alkene chains and cyclization of alkene chains to cyclic intermediate com- pounds, which were, finally, dehydrogenated to aromatic hydrocarbons. Since the H-ZSM-22 catalyst did not contain Ga or Zn metals as such the reactions of 196 N. Kumar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 189-199 dehydrogenation and cyclization did not occur over this catalyst and hence aromatics were not formed. It is also assumed that highly strengthened and well-separated BrCnsted acid sites favoured oligomerization and cracking of olefins and olefinic intermediates. Most likely aromatics are formed over the external surface of ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts because unlike ZSM-5 zeolites, ZSM-22 zeolites have smaller pore size and do not possess channel intersections suitable for adapting larger cyclic molecules. The hydrogen produced over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts was much greater than that over H-ZSM-22, a further indication that Ga and Zn act as effective dehydrogenating agents for n-butane and naphthenic intermediates producing olefins and aromat- ics. It can be concluded that conversion of n-butane into aromatic hydrocarbons over Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-22 catalysts is strongly reducing in nature because of the large amount of hydrogen produced during the reaction. The effect of reaction temperature was also studied over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H- ZSM-22 catalysts pretreated with hydrogen for 2 h at 803 K. The n-butane conversion over reduced Ga-H-ZSM-22 was lower at temperatures of 773 and 803 K than oxidised Ga-H-ZSM-22, however, selectivity to aromatics at 743 and 773 K was higher for reduced Ga-H-ZSM-22 catalysts than for the oxidised Ga-H-ZSM-22 catalysts. The reduced Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts exhibited higher conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatics than oxidized Zn-H-ZSM-22 at all three temperatures. Lower conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatics over reduced Ga-H-ZSM-22 at higher temperature could be explained by assuming that a substantial number of Ga3 + ions could not enter the channels of the zeolite. The positive effect on the activity and selectivity of the hydrogen pretreated catalysts could be due to changes in the electronic state, dispersion and location of Ga and Zn species in the ZSM-22 structure. 3.2. Effect of space velocity on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over HoZSM-22, Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 Experiments to determine the effect of space velocity were carried out with space velocities (WHSV) of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 h-~ at 803 K. With increasing space velocity over the H-ZSM-22 catalyst, n-butane conversion decreased while the total gaseous product increased, however, the isomers of butenes increased more than other gaseous products. Benzene was the only aromatic product obtained at the lowest space velocity (1.5 h-l), at space velocity higher than this, aromatics were not obtained over this catalyst. Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts exhibited a decrease in the n-butane conversion with increasing space velocity (Fig. 6). The formation of total gaseous products also increased with increasing space velocity over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts, indicating that reactions of oligomerisation and cyclisation were less favourable in high space velocity conditions. The isomers of butenes (trans-2- butene, 1-butene, isobutene, cis-2-butene) and propene increased more than the N.

At the lowest space velocity (1.5 h-l), the aromatic hydrocarbons obtained were benzene, toluene, o-, m-, p-xylenes, and ethylben- zene. The selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons also decreased with increase in the space velocity over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts (Fig. 7). At the highest space velocity the aromatic hydrocarbons, such as isomers of xylenes, were not obtained, which led to conclusion that the formation of these products was favoured at high contact time, i.e. a longer contact time of the reactant with the catalyst was required to produce these aromatics. 30 25 o \" 20- E 15- E o 10- .A . @ , , @ 2 3 4 5 WHSV (h~) Fig. 7.

It was observed that the conversion of n-butane over H-ZSM-22 was constant and that it decreased slightly in the beginning, demonstrating that the catalyst was stable and that the coke formation was not very extensive. Also the visual observation of the reactor after the reaction showed that the catalyst in the reactor did not turn black. The decrease in n-butane conversion and selectivity to aromatics over Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 were higher than for the H-ZSM-22 catalyst (Figs. 8 and 9). The blocking up of Ga and Zn sites by some coke deposition could be the reason for the reduction in the dehydrogenation capacity of these sites and thus for decreasing the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts. 4. Conclusions A highly crystalline K-ZSM-22, free of amorphous material and cristobalite impurity has been synthesised. The modification of ZSM-22 by Ga and Zn did not affect the geometrical structure of the ZSM-22 zeolite. BrCnsted acid sites were found to be present in the H-ZSM-22, Ga-and Zn-modified ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts, which together with Ga and Zn gave the synthesized catalysts a bifunctional character. The conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to aro- matic hydrocarbons over Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 catalysts were higher than for H-ZSM-22 catalysts. The primary role of Ga and Zn was in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and cyclic intermediate compounds and the acid sites catalyzing oligomerisation of alkenes. The hydrogen pretreatment of Ga-H- ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts had a positive influence on the n-butane conversion and on the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons. References [1] G.T.

All rights reserved Synthesis and characterization of H-ZSM-22, Zn-H-ZSM-22 and Ga-H-ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts and their catalytic activity in the aromatization of n-butane N. Kumar L.E. Lindfors R. Byggningsbacka Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Engineering,Åbo Akademi University, Biskopsgatan 8, FIN-20500Åbo ,Finland K-ZSM-22 zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 53 have been synthesized by means of the hydrothermal synthesis method using 1,6-diaminohexane as the templating agent. The H-ZSM-22, Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 zeolite catalysts have been prepared and characterised by X-ray powder diffraction (Philips pw 1830), scanning electron microscopy (Leica Cambridge Stereoscan 360), nitrogen adsorption (Carlo Erba Instruments), X-ray fluorescence (Outokumpu-8000) and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. The synthesised ZSM-22 zeolite was highly crystalline and free of amorphous material. The TPD of ammonia profiles revealed that the H-ZSM-22, Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 were acidic and consisted of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The catalytic activity were investigated for the conversion of n-butane to aromatic hydrocarbons over H-ZSM-22, Ga-H-ZSM-22 and Zn-H-ZSM-22 catalysts. Further, the effect of temperature and the space velocity on the conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons were studied. The selectivity to aromatics was higher for Ga and Zn modified ZSM-22 than for H-ZSM-22. The effect of time on stream on n-butane conversion and the selectivity to aromatics was studied at 803 K for 4.5 h.
