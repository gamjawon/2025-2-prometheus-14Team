Graphical abstract A novel graphene framework embedded with highly dispersed Co nano-dots (Co-NDs@G) was developed as high-performance sulfur storage and immobilization material for Li-S batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold great promises to serve as next-generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental benignity. However, the shuttle effect of the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur lead to low sulfur utilization and coulombic efficiency, leading to poor cycling performance. The impeded charge transportation and retard LiPS catalytic conversion also endows the Li-S batteries with sluggish redox reaction, leading to unsatisfied rate capability. In this study, Co-based MOF material ZIF-67 is used as the precursor to prepare Co nano-dots decorated three-dimensional graphene aerogel as sulfur immobilizer. This porous architecture establishes a highly conductive interconnected framework for fast charge/mass transportation. The exposed Co nano-dots serve as active sites to strongly trap LiPS, which endows Co-NDs@G with low decomposition energy barrier for fast LiPS conversion reaction and promote the completely Li2S catalytic transformation. Li-S cells based on the Co-NDs@G cathode exhibits excellent cyclability and a high capacity retention rate of 91.1% in 100 cycles. This strategy offers a new direction to design sulfur immobilizer for accelerated LiPS conversion kinetics of Li-S batteries. Keywords Lithium-sulfur batteries Co nano-dots Graphene network Metal–organic framework High-loading cathodes 1 Introduction Li-S batteries have been considered as a promising candidate for next generation energy storage devices due to its high theoretical energy density (1675 mAh g−1) and high energy density of sulfur cathode (2600 Wh kg−1) [1–3]. Sulfur is also a natural abundance and environmental friendly material for large scale production [4–7]. However, the practical application of Li-S battery is still hindered by many problems, such as low Coulomb efficiency, rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability [8,9]. The deep-seated problems leading to these obstacles are: (1) The low electrical conductivity of sulfur and its discharge product Li2S [10]; (2) the loss of sulfur active substances caused by the dissolution of its intermediate discharge products lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and its severe “shuttle effect”, resulting in continuous consumption of sulfur active materials [11,12]; (3) large volume expansion of sulfur (>80%), which results in mechanical failure of cathode [13]. In order to solve these problems, various carbonaceous and carbon/metal host materials, such as N-doped carbon [14,15], graphene [16], covalent organic frameworks (COF) [17] and metal–organic frameworks [18] with high specific surface area, have been studied as sulfur carriers in Li-S batteries [19]. Among them, graphene materials have attracted special attention because of its excellent mechanical flexibility, great electrical conductivity and large specific surface area [20,21]. However, the non-polar hydrophobic graphene materials can only offer weak binding capability with polysulfides, which result in poor chemical interaction with LiPS and fast capacity fading during cycling [22]. Also, the sluggish kinetic conversion of LiPS during the electrochemical reactions process is still disappointing [23]. In this case, polar materials, such as Co3O4 [24], MnO2 [25], NiO [26] and TiO2 [27], have been developed as additives in sulfur cathode to effectively adsorb soluble LiPS [28]. To further achieving higher active interfaces for fast redox reaction, the nano-dimensionally dispersed electrocatalyst has been introduced as additives. The evenly distributed nano-dots in conductive matrix can provide abundant active surfaces for electrochemical interaction with LiPS, thus achieving enhanced catalytic effect with limited catalyst content [29]. Therefore, developing the composite sulfur immobilizer with nano-dimensionally dispersed polar additives as sulfur cathodes puts forward a new research direction for the composition and structure design toward high-performance Li-S performances [30]. In this paper, a facile method has been developed to design graphene framework embedded with highly dispersed Co nano-dots (Co-NDs@G), using MOF as precursor. The three-dimensional porous graphene exhibits large specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity, which establishes a highly conductive pathway for the rapid electron/ion transportation. The large porosity of graphene gel also serves as excellent sulfur reservoir for high content sulfur storage and immobilization. Meanwhile, the Co nano-dots, which inlaid in graphene gel, act as active sites to strengthen LiPS adsorption and accelerate its catalytic conversion, leading to efficiently suppressed shuttle effect. Attributed to its structural superiorities, the Co-NDs@G composites demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance as sulfur cathode in Li-S batteries, such as good cyclability with a high capacity retention of 75.5% after 500 cycles and high rate capability up to 5 C. This strategy pioneers a new way for sulfur cathode design towards high efficiency sulfur electrochemistry as well as high-performance Li-S batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 The preparation of Co-NDs@G 15 mL graphite oxide (GO) (5 mg/mL) was diluted to 50 mL with distilled water. Then, 0.2 g l-ascorbic acid sodium salt (l-AASS) was added into the GO solution, stirred evenly, and heated in a water bath at 40 °C for 24 h [31]. After the gel was formed, the salt was removed with distilled water, and then dried for 3 days at room temperature. Finally, the graphene gel was prepared via freeze-drying. The graphene gel was immersed in the ZIF-67 precursor solution to grow ZIF-67 particles on the surface (ZIF-67/GO). The ZIF-67/GO was heated to 600 °C in a tube furnace in an argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 6 °C/min for 1 hour. The resulting product is Co-NDs@G. 2.2 Physical characterization The crystalline phase of the sample was studied by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker, D8 Discover). The morphology of the samples was collected by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and structure was performed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2010F). The chemical states of the sample was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha XPS, Thermo Scientific). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The sulfur cathode (S/Co-NDs@G) was prepared by an ordinary hydrothermal perfusion method [31]. Co-NDs@G, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder and Super P (mass ratio 8:1:1) were physically mixed and well dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was further coated on aluminum foil and punched into disks to prepare S/Co-NDs@G electrode. The amount of electrolyte used in the coin-type cell is 20 μL. The content of sulfur is 1.91 mg. The diameter of cathode is 10 mm and the areal loading of sulfur cathode is 2.45 mg cm−2. The diameter of separator and anode is 19 mm, and 16 mm, respectively. The coin-cell battery was assembled in a glove box which was filled with argon (99.9995% Cairo). Lithium plate was used as the anode while the commercial microporous polypropylene was used as separator. The electrolyte was composed of 1.0 M lithium (trifluoromethane sulfonimide) imide (LiTFSI) in DOL/DME solution (v/v = 1:1), and 0.1 M LiNO3 was added as additive. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was carried out at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s in the range of 1.7–2.8 V (VMP3, biological potentiostat) via a multi-channel battery test system (BTS-5 V, 20 mA, Shenzhen Neware Co., Ltd.). All the experiments were carried out at room temperature. 2.4 Density functional theory calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program and exchange and correlation energy terms were performed using Perdew Burke Ernzerhof functional. A plane-wave cut off energy was 400 eV. 15 Å was used between successive slabs as vacuum height. The k-space was chosen using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid. In the DFT modeling, the Co (111) surface is selected because it is the crystal surface that observed in HRTEM imaging analysis. The N-doped species is constructed based on the XPS analysis. In the calculations, the force on the atoms was set to smaller than 0.03 eV/Å to ensure the ground-state atomic geometry was fully relaxed. The binding energies (E bind) between Li2S6 and the Co nano-dots are shown in the following formula: E bind = E LiPS/slab - E slab - E LiPS where E LiPS/slab is the energy of LiPS adsorbed on Co nano-dots slab, E slab is the energy of the Co nano-dots, E LiPS represents the energy of isolated LiPS [32]. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis method of Co-NDs@G is shown in Fig. 1 . Firstly, graphene network (GN) is synthesized by a gelation process. Secondly, the dried graphene gel is soaked in the precursor solution of ZIF-67, in which the Co2+ is coordinated with 2-methylimidazole in methanol, and through rich hydrophilic sites such as –OH and –COOH on the graphene surface to form 3D ZIF-67/GO gel, uniform ZIF-67 polyhedron with an average particle size of 40 nm are synthesized on the surface of graphene [33]. Finally, the graphene gel embedded with evenly distributed Co nano-dots is obtained after calcining in the argon atmosphere. The composite structure of Co nano-dots and graphene demonstrates cross-linked honeycomb structure to efficiently stockpile sulfur, which can alleviate the destructive effect of the volume expansion of polysulfides on the positive electrode and enhance the ability of ion transmission [34]. Graphene conductive network can also enhance the electron transportation, and the nitrogen sites on the surface of graphene can adsorb polysulfides. Co nano-dots can efficiently improve the catalysis and adsorption of polysulfides, and promote the transformation of polysulfides and inhibit the shuttle effect [35]. Fig. 2 (a) shows a macroscopic image of the graphene gel with ZIF-67 particles. The morphology of graphene gel is shown in Fig. S1. It can be seen that there are uniform ZIF-67 particles on the gel surface and Fig. 2(b) is a high magnification SEM images of ZIF-67/GO. The ZIF-67 as a sacrificial template provides an excellent Co source for the subsequent formation of Co nanoparticles. The element mapping in Fig. 2(c) also proves the uniform distribution of Co, N, O and C in graphene surface and ZIF-67 polyhedron. Fig. 2(d and e) displays a macroscopic diagram of calcined ZIF-67/GO, which shows the intact framework of graphene gel, providing a stable site and three-dimensional conductive network for sulfur electrochemical reaction. It can be seen that the Co nano-dots evenly grow on the surface of graphene with uniform size distribution. The graphene gels with high (Co-HNDs@G) and low (Co-LNDs@G) density of Co nano-dots are also synthesized, as shown in Fig. S2. Fig. 3 (a) is the macroscopic TEM diagram of Co-NDs@G, and the uniform distribution of Co nano-dots can be observed. The Fig. 3(a) inset shows the Co nano-dots diameter distribution, which shows that the diameters of these nanoparticles are distributed between 4–20 nm and mainly around 10 nm. The content of Co component in Co-NDs@G composite was studied via TGA analysis under atmospheric air. The result shows that, after graphene is removed, 41.3 wt% weight was remained (Fig. S3). Fig. 3(b) shows the microscopic TEM diagram of Co nano-dots. Regular and ordered diffraction stripes show the good crystallinity of Co nano-dots, which is also proved by the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) of Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the edge of Co nano-dots. It can be clearly seen that the lattice spacing of Co (111) and C (002) is 0.204 nm and 0.34 nm respectively. The morphology of Co and C is further analyzed by Fourier transform (FFT) mode and inverse FFT image (Fig. 3e, f), which further shows the good crystallinity of Co nano-dots, formed through hypergolic response of MOF and high-temperature carbothermal reduction method, proving the feasibility of preparing highly dispersed Co nanoparticles by using ZIF-67 as Co source sacrificial template. The uniform distribution of Co, O, N, C in the Co-NDs@G was further confirmed by EDX elemental mapping, as shown in Fig. 3(g). The XRD pattern (Fig. 4 a) of Co-NDs@G exhibtis a broad peak at ~25°, which can be assigned to the (002) diffraction peak of graphene. The characteristic peaks at 44.1°, 51.2° and 75.6° are related to the Co0 (JCPDS No. 15–0806), which proves the existence of metallic Co inside Co-NDs@G. As shown in Fig. S4(a), the XRD patterns of the S/Co-NDs@G are perfectly matched with Co-NDs@G and sulfur. In addition, the S/Co-NDs@G exhibits a group of diffraction peaks, which coincides with the peaks of Co-NDs@G at 44.1°, 51.2° and 75.6°, indicating the existence of Co nano-dots in S/Co-NDs@G. The Raman spectra in Fig. 4(b) reveal a similar ID/IG values between ZIF-67/GO and Co-NDs@G, indicating their similar defective state of graphene [36]. Fig. 4(c) shows the Co 2p XPS spectra of ZIF-67/GO and Co-NDs@G, the characteristic peak of Co0 state is observed in the Co 2p XPS spectrum of Co-NDs@G, suggesting the formation of metallic Co. The SEM and TEM analysis have shown that the metallic Co nanoparticles are very small (~10 nm). These Co nano-dots would serve as efficient catalyst for LiPS conversion during the charge/discharge process, which benefits the Li-S batteries. High resolution N 1s XPS spectra reveals the existence of four types of N species including pyridine N (398.8 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), graphitic N (401 eV) and oxidized N (401.9 eV) (Fig. 4d) [37]. In addition, the emergence of pyridine N and pyrrolic N peaks might represent N-Co bond and was obviously enriched, which illustrates the formation of M–N–C coordination [38], which can serve as active sites for redox reaction for LiPS catalytic conversion. As shown in Fig. S5(a and b), the emergence of C–N and C=N bonds C 1s spectrum confirms the existence of heteroatom doping in the carbon lattice. The Co 2p spectrum of S/Co-NDs@G composite (Fig. 4e) confirms the existence of metallic Co and the Co-N species in the material, which is consistent with XPS analyzation of Co-NDs@G. In addition, the peaks at 782.5 eV and 798.6 eV can be assigned to Co–S species, which related to the stronger chemical bondage between Co nano-dots and LiPS, which contributes to the stability of S/Co-NDs@G cathode [39]. The porous characters of ZIF-67/GO and Co-NDs@G are studied by N2 adsorption–desorption method (Fig. S6a and b). The isothermal curve shows that the adsorption behavior of Co-NDs@G is stronger than that of ZIF-67, and the specific surface area of Co-NDs@G is larger than that of ZIF-67/GO, indicating that heat treatment can increase the surface porosity of graphene. The pore size distribution shows that Co-NDs@G contains enriched small mesopores, which is able to efficiently stockpile sulfur and inhibit polysulfide shuttle [40]. The higher surface area is also beneficial to effectively expose the active site and provides a rich electrode/electrolyte interface for sulfur conversion reaction [41]. The adsorption capability of Co-NDs@G towards LiPS was also evaluated by immersing it into Li2S6 solution (Fig. 5 a). The solution is prepared by mixing sulfur powder and lithium sulfide with a molar ratio of 5:1, and were added into DME/DOL (1:1, v/v) and stirred at 50 °C for 24 h in an Ar-filled glovebox. The results show that the solution with Co-NDs@G has a transparent color, indicating its strong adsorption properties for polysulfides. In addition, the UV–vis spectra of Li2S6 solution adsorbed by Co-NDs@G shows the lowest peak intensity (Fig. 5a). After adsorption, the S 2p XPS spectra of Co-NDs@G shows two pairs of peaks at 161.4 and 162.8 eV belonging to terminal sulfur (ST –1) and bridged sulfur (SB 0), respectively (Fig. 5b). These peaks have a higher binding energy range than the pure LiPS, indicating that electron transfer leads to the decrease of electron cloud density, which may form the interaction between LiPS and Co metal [42]. From the Li 1s spectrum after adsorption in Fig. 5(c), it can be seen that there is a new peak of Li–O bonding, implying the form of the lithium bond-like configuration at 55.7 eV after Co-NDs@G adsorption by LiPS. The fast LiPS conversion kinetics was further examined by electrochemical evaluation. CV profiles of symmetrical cells show that Co-NDs@G material has the largest and sharpest redox peak and the smallest redox polarization (Fig. 5d), indicating its strong catalytic ability to LiPS. In the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement, the catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 14 mg Co-NDs@G, 4 mg Super P, and 2 mg polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 5 mL NMP. The ink was ultrasound by 30 min, and then coated on the glass carbon disk electrode with a mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. The electrolyte is 0.1 M Li2S methanol solution. The LSV tests were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The LSV measurement of Co-NDs@G in Fig. 5(e) demonstrates the lowest initial potential of −0.57 V and the highest oxidation current (1.6 mA) under 1.6 V [43], The Co-NDs@G has lowest onset potential of −0.57 V indicating its lowest activation energy to electrochemically convert solid Li2S to soluble LiPS. 1.6 mA represents the limiting current density, indicating that the conversion rate of Li2S to soluble LiPS is faster under the same voltage. The interactive chemistry between different types of LiPS and Co-NDs@G was revealed by DFT calculation. The results shows that there exist considerable binding energies (BE) between LiPS and the N, Co-doped graphene sheet (Fig. 5f), indicating its good LiPS immobilization performance. Fig. 5(g and h) shows the geometrical configurations of Li2S2 and Li2S6 adsorption on Co (111) surface, which show high BE values of −5.16 and −4.30 eV, respectively. Note that, since Co-NDs@G is developed through the calcination of ZIF-67@GO (N, Co-containing precursor), it is difficult to directly distinguish the effects of Co and N on the battery performances. However, it was reported that Co nano-dots [44] and N-doped graphene [45] both can have positive effects on lithium-sulfur batteries. Moreover, our DFT calculations also showed that metal Co, Co-N-C, and N-doped graphene sites exhibits high binding energy towards polysulfide species. The decomposition energy profiles of Li2S2 on Co (111) surfaces demonstrates a very low diffusion energy barrier of 0.15 eV (Fig. 5i), indicating the fast LiPS catalytic conversion on Co-NDs@G. The strong chemical interactions and fast LiPS transformation endows Co-NDs@G with strong chemical trapping and accelerated conversion kinetics of LiPS, rendering enhanced sulfur electrochemical reversibility. The favored redox reaction kinetics is further studied by CV test and its Li-ion diffusion coefficient (D Li +) was calculated (Fig. 6 ). The electrocatalytic activity of Co to LiPS during charge and discharge of Li-S battery is proved, and the electrocatalytic activity of Co-HNDs@G, Co-LNDs@G and ZIF-67/GO electrode was compared. The obvious positive shift of the reduction peak of the Co-NDs@G electrode and the negative shift of the oxidation peak show that the graphene gel with suitable Co nano-dots density has a faster electrochemical reaction rate and better catalytic activity (Fig. 6a–d). According to the Randles-Sevick equation, the diffusion coefficient of lithium-ion is calculated according to the slope of the linear relationship between the peak current (I p) and the square root of the scanning rate (V0.5) (Fig. 6e–g). The diffusion coefficients of Co-NDs@G electrodes at peaks A-1, C-1 and C-2 are 2.50 × 10−7, 3.16 × 10−8 and 3.16 × 10−8 cm2 s−1, respectively (Table S1). Compared with other cathode materials, Co-NDs@G shows the highest D Li +, indicating its faster Li-ion transportation and the favored reaction kinetics (Fig. 6h). Therefore, the introduction of dispersed Co nano-dots efficiently facilitates ion transportation on the active interfaces and catalyzes the LiPS conversion, leading to admirable sulfur electrochemistry. To evaluate the electrochemical performance of Co-NDs@G as sulfur immobilizer, the S/Co-NDs@G composite was prepared by melt-impregnation method, which shows a high sulfur content of 75.6 wt%, as determined by TGA (Fig. S7). Fig. 7 (a) shows the initial cycle CV curve of Li-S battery with S/Co-NDs@G as a cathode material. The two cathodic peaks can be observed at 2.30 and 2.02 V, corresponding to the reduction of soluble Li2S x (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) from elemental sulfur and its further reduction into insoluble Li2S2/Li2S, respectively. The peak at 2.38 V in anodic scanning is attributed to the oxidation of sulfur species. It is worth noting that there is a good overlap between the CV curve and the initial cycle, indicating that the Li-S battery based on S/Co-NDs@G cathode has good electrochemical reversibility. The cycling performance at 0.2C of S/Co-NDs@G cathode with different Co loading was further evaluated, which shows a high discharge capacity of 1122.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles corresponding to a capacity retention of 91.1% (Fig. 7b). This discharge capacity is much higher than S/Co-HNDs@G (855.5 mAh g−1), S/Co-LNDs@G (746.7 mAh g−1) and S/ZIF-67/GO (603.3 mAh g−1), indicating its stronger inhibition of LiPS shuttle. For comparison reason, we have also developed the sulfur cathode using carbonized ZIF-67 without graphene gel (C-ZIF-67). The Li-S battery with S/ C-ZIF-67 cathode exhibits faster capacity decay at 0.2C than that of S/Co-NDs@G (Fig. S8), suggesting that graphene architecture induce positive effect on sulfur storage and immobilization. The charge–discharge profiles of S/Co-NDs@G maintain the similar charge and discharge plateaus for more than 100 cycles, indicating its good reaction kinetics and cycling stability (Fig. 7c). S/Co-NDs@G also demonstrate a superb rate capability with a relatively high capacity of 658.9 mAh g−1 at 5 C, which is much competitive than that of S/Co-HNDs@G (289.2 mAh g−1), S/Co-LNDs@G (200.3 mAh g−1) and S/ZIF-67/GO (110.8 mAh g−1), as shown in Fig. 7(d and e). As the current rate increases, the S/Co-NDs@G still maintains similar potential hysteresis, confirming its enhanced reaction kinetics in promoting sulfur redox reaction. The EIS spectra also reveals the smallest semi-circle in the middle-to-high frequency region, indicating its smallest charge transfer resistance and fast charge transportation of S/Co-NDs@G, as consistent with rate performance analyhzations (Fig. 7h). The cycle performance under high sulfur loading cathode is further examined, as shown in Fig. 7(f). It can be seen that the reversible capacity of the S/Co-NDs@G electrode is still maintained a high areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm−2 after 50 cycles under the high sulfur content of 6.8 mg cm−2, holding great potential for practical application. The amount of electrolyte used in the cells with different sulfur loading is 30 μL (3.8 mg cm−2), 40 μL (5.3 mg cm−2), 45 μL (5.5 mg cm−2) and 50 μL (6.8 mg cm−2). Long-term cycling tests was carried out to evaluate its structural stability and efficient LiPS shuttle inhibition, as shown in Fig. 7(g). An admirable capacity retention of 75.5% can be achieved over 500 cycles, corresponding to a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle. This further confirms the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect of Co-NDs@G materials and stable sulfur electrochemistry. The robust architecture efficiently suppresses the dissolution and shuttle effect of LiPS while the nano-dimensionally dispersed Co nano-dots significantly boost LiPS conversion kinetics, leading to superior Li-S chemistry. Table S2 shows a comparison of the Li-S performance with similar cathodes reported in the literature [46–50], demonstrating the good performance of the present Co-NDs@G electrode. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed a feasible method to synthesis Co nano-dots decorated graphene gel framework by using MOF as precursor in Li-S battery to serve as multifunctional sulfur immobilizer. The hierarchical porous architecture benefits sulfur storage and immobilization. Meanwhile, the sufficient surface area of graphene gel embedded with appropriate amount of Co nano-dots offers strong adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPS. When Co-NDs@G composite was employed as the cathode material, the Li-S batteries exhibit excellent performance, including high discharge capacity under raised sulfur loading, superb rate capability up to 5 C and excellent cyclic stability over 500 cycles. This work provides a new synthesis strategy for inhibit shuttle effect of LiPS and improving sulfur redox efficiency, which holds great potential for the high-performance development of Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold great promises to serve as next-generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and environmental benignity. However, the shuttle effect of the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur lead to low sulfur utilization and coulombic efficiency, leading to poor cycling performance. The impeded charge transportation and retard LiPS catalytic conversion also endows the Li-S batteries with sluggish redox reaction, leading to unsatisfied rate capability. In this study, Co-based MOF material ZIF-67 is used as the precursor to prepare Co nano-dots decorated three-dimensional graphene aerogel as sulfur immobilizer. This porous architecture establishes a highly conductive interconnected framework for fast charge/mass transportation. The exposed Co nano-dots serve as active sites to strongly trap LiPS, which endows Co-NDs@G with low decomposition energy barrier for fast LiPS conversion reaction and promote the completely Li2S catalytic transformation. Li-S cells based on the Co-NDs@G cathode exhibits excellent cyclability and a high capacity retention rate of 91.1% in 100 cycles. This strategy offers a new direction to design sulfur immobilizer for accelerated LiPS conversion kinetics of Li-S batteries.",
