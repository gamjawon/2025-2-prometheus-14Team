Graphical abstract Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) can utilize hydrogen with high efficiency without emitting pollutants. For the dissemination of the PEMFCs in the automotive industry, the stable automobile operation under transient conditions is important. Under fuel starvation, carbon oxidation can take place at the anode, reversing the cell voltage. By covering the carbon support with finely dispersed IrOx, the contact of carbon with water can be avoided minimizing carbon oxidation, instead, water is electrolyzed on the IrOx. Here, we deposited IrOx nanoparticles on the Pt/C with highly defective carbon. Contrary to the common belief that defective carbon is vulnerable to corrosion, the catalyst could endure better in the absence of H2, with the longest time of 44 h until reaching the cell voltage of −2.5 V. When the IrOx was immobilized on more defective carbon, the electrochemical surface area was higher, and the surface IrOx was more oxidic, resulting in higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and better CO tolerance. The carbon defects remaining after IrOx deposition were further removed by oxidizing the catalyst. The effect of the oxidation temperature was also examined. Keywords Reversal tolerant anode (RTA) PEMFC Durability Water electrolysis Fuel starvation 1 Introduction Fuel cells which directly convert chemical energy into electrical energy can be used for sustainable electricity production. Among various types of fuel cells, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) operate at relatively low temperature (60–100 °C) and has high power density [1–3]. When PEMFCs are used in transportation, their feature of zero-emission will contribute significantly to the environment. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) require short refueling time of less than 5 min and they can offer longer driving range due to high power to weight ratio, compared to battery electric vehicles. Despite the improvement in PEMFC performance, its lifetime can severely decrease under real operation [4]. Automobiles repetitively encounter harsh transient conditions such as start-up/shut-down, idling, and load changes [5–7]. Fuel starvation, which can occur during load changes or can occur locally upon water flooding, can cause severe performance degradation [8]. Under normal operation, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) readily occurs with very low overpotential at the anode [9–13]. The potential at the anode usually stays around the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential. However, when the load suddenly changes or the anode channel is blocked by water flooding, the carbon support can react with water to produce protons, which is required for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. Then the cell voltage is reversed, imposing very high potential at the anode, which is detrimental to the cell [14,15]. The pore structure of the electrode can collapse [16,17], and pinholes can be formed on membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which might lead to fatal explosion by mixing of reactant gases [18]. In order to avoid the cell voltage reversal, various approaches have been reported. The outlet gases from the anode and cathode have been monitored [19], the cell has been segmented and the local current densities have been monitored [20], or proportional-integral–differential (PID) controller has been added to regulate fuel to air ratio [21]. However, these methods require considerable cost to add sensors or controllers and the feedback might not be prompt enough to replenish H2. Highly graphitized carbon support [22,23], non-carbon support such as tungsten carbide [24] or indium tin oxide [25] have been used to minimize the carbon corrosion. The catalyst layer was coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to form hydrophobic layer, expelling the water [26]. In these cases, the cell structure would be preserved better even at high potential, but it might increase potential danger further, leading to catastrophic sudden cell failure. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst can be added on the anode, then the lacking protons would be provided from water hydrolysis, suppressing carbon oxidation. Hong et al. used a physical mixture of IrO2, which was synthesized by the Adams fusion method, and the commercial Pt/C for the anode. The reversal time, which is the duration time until the cell voltage reaches −2.5 V, was 76 min at the relative humidity of 68% [14]. Moore et al. used the IrOx/TiO2 to minimize the reversal loss. The physical mixture of the IrOx/TiO2 and the commercial Pt/C had the reversal time of ~ 200 min at the relative humidity of 100% [27]. The schemes in Fig. 1 describe the various situations in normal operation, under H2 starvation, or using reversal tolerant anode with OER catalyst. In this study, we deposited IrOx nanoparticles on the Pt/C with different extents of carbon defects, and tested their PEMFC performance and cell voltage reversal tolerance. The product gas from the cell outlet was monitored with on-line mass spectroscopy to identify the reaction taken place at the anode. The OER activity and CO tolerance were compared. The effect of oxidation temperature was also evaluated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst syntheses Ir nanoparticles prepared by the polyol method were deposited on the commercially available Pt/C, following the recipe modified from our previous work [28]. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, >98.0%, Samchun) was added into ethylene glycol (EG, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) to adjust the pH to be 12. Sodium acetate (CH3COONa, Sigma-Aldrich) 32.0 mg was also added to the EG solution. Iridium (III) chloride hydrate (IrCl3·xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich) 37.0 mg was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water then added into 50 mL of the EG solution. The Ir precursors were reduced by refluxing the EG solution at 160 °C for 3 h in the N2 atmosphere. The Pt/C was added into the Ir solution with a weight ratio of Pt to Ir of 2:1. The different types of Pt/C were used; Pt 40% on carbon black (HiSPEC® 4000, Johnson Matthey; JM), Pt 36.8% on high surface area carbon (TEC10E40E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo; TKK HSA) and Pt 37.4% on VULCAN® XC-72 (TEC10V40E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo; TKK V). The commercial Pt/C 100 mg was dispersed in 50 mL of 0.3 wt% acetic acid (CH3COOH, ≥99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution. After mixing the Pt/C solution with the Ir solution, the pH of the total solution was adjusted to be 0.5 by adding 1 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35.0–37.0%, Samchun) solution. After stirring overnight, the suspension was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven. Then, the heat treatment was conducted for 2 h in static air to produce IrOx on Pt/C. The temperature for heat treatment was varied in 250 ~ 400 °C. For comparison, IrOx was prepared by the Adams fusion method. IrCl3·xH2O 100 mg and sodium nitrate (NaNO3, ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) 2 g were dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water. The suspension was dried at 80 °C, ground, and calcined in an alumina boat at 350 °C for 30 min. After cooled to room temperature, the sample was washed with deionized water to remove excess NaNO3 and dried. 2.2 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts were obtained by field emission TEM (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, FEI Company). High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were taken by Titan Double Cs corrected TEM (Titan cubed G2 60–300, FEI Company) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The extent of carbon defects was confirmed by high resolution Raman (LabRAM HR Evolution visible_NIR, HORIBA). The oxidation state of metal was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha, Thermo VG Scientific). The peak for advantageous C 1 s was calibrated to be 284.8 eV. The powder X-Ray diffractometer (XRD, SmartLab, RIGAKU) was used to verify the structure and composition of the catalyst. The actual metal content was confirmed by TGA (TG209 F1 Libra, NETZSCH). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore size were estimated by measuring N2 isotherms (3Flex, Micromeritics). All the characterizations mentioned above were carried out in KARA (KAIST Analysis Center for Research Advancement). The product gas from the cell was analyzed by mass spectrometer (BELMass, MicrotracBEL Corp.) in real-time. The anode outlet tube was extended and connected into the water trap, so that the water from the product gas could be removed before reaching the detector. Then, the tip of the detector was placed inside of the tube with proper sealing. 2.3 Half-cell tests Half-cell tests were carried out with a three-electrode system by bi-potentiostat (CHI 730E, CH Instruments) at room temperature. Ag/AgCl (RE-5B, BASi) stored in 3 M NaCl was used for a reference electrode and Pt wire was used for a counter electrode. All the potentials stated in this study are calibrated with an RHE. The RHE potential was measured by conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under H2 purging. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the catalyst in 1.25 mL of deionized water, 3.75 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%, JUNSEI), and 20 μL of Nafion ionomer (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was sonicated for 30 min then 18 μL of the catalyst ink was deposited on a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). The activation was conducted by repeating the CV from 0.05 V to 1.1 V (vs. RHE) for 50 cycles with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. HOR was conducted by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 at 1600 rpm. OER was conducted by LSV in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 at 1600 rpm. CO stripping was conducted in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. CO adsorption was conducted by flowing CO (99.999%) with 80 cc min−1 for 25 min then performing chronoamperometry at 0.05 V for 25 min under Ar flow. The adsorbed CO was stripped by CV from 0.05 V to 1.1 V at 100 mV s−1 under Ar flow. 2.4 Single-cell tests The membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated by the catalyst-coated diffusion-layer (CCD) method. The geometric active area of the electrode was 5 cm2. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst in the solution composed of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%, JUNSEI) and deionized water with a volume ratio of 3:1. Nafion ionomer (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) was also added to the ink and the ionomer/carbon (I/C) weight ratio of all the catalyst ink was set to be 0.8. A commercial gas diffusion layer (39BC, SGL) was used. The Pt loading at the cathode was 0.4 mgPt cm−2 with commercial Pt/C (Pt 40 wt%, Johnson Matthey) and the metal loading at the anode was 0.1 mgPt cm−2 + 0.05 mgIr cm−2 with the synthesized Pt-IrOx/C catalysts. The actual metal content of the catalyst samples was checked by TGA. The electrodes were hot-pressed with Nafion 211 at 135 °C with 430 psi for 135 sec. The activation was conducted to fully hydrate the membrane. Starting from 0.001 A, the current increased until the cut off voltage of 0.250 V is reached. After the rest time of 5 sec to recover open circuit voltage (OCV), the procedure was repeated for 1 h. Reversal tolerance test was conducted by chronopotentiometry at 0.2 A cm−2 until the voltage reaches −2.5 V. The cell temperature was set to 65 °C. With 100% relative humidity (RH), H2 and air were supplied to anode and cathode, respectively. In 5 min since the chronopotentiometry began, H2 was changed to Ar to simulate fuel starvation condition at the anode. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reversal tolerance of Pt-IrOx catalyst anchored on carbon defects Carbon supports are commonly used in various electrochemical systems owing to its low cost, high conductivity, and large surface area. The carbon support with high surface area typically has many functional groups, which are essential to disperse the metal nanoparticles finely [29]. However, the surface oxygenated species also result in low electrical conductivity and poor durability [30,31]. Particularly, carbon oxidation reaction (COR) can deteriorate the cell performance irreversibly. We purchased nominally 40 wt% Pt/C catalysts with different carbon features. Pt on high surface area carbon from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo is denoted as ‘TKK HSA Pt/C’, Pt on VULCAN® XC-72 from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo is denoted as ‘TKK V Pt/C’, and Pt on carbon black from Johnson Matthey is denoted as ‘JM Pt/C’. The defect ratio of the carbon supports was estimated from Raman spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 2 . The Raman peaks were deconvoluted into one graphitic peak and four defect peaks [32–36]. The G peak appears at ~1590 cm−1 indicating sp2 ideal graphitic structure, the D1 peak at ~1360 cm−1 corresponding to the edges of sp2 carbon, the D2 peak at ~1620 cm−1 corresponding to disordered carbon, the D3 peak at ~1500 cm−1 corresponding to amorphous carbon, and the D4 peak at ~1200 cm−1 corresponding to ionic impurities or sp3 carbon. When the peak area ratio of D peak and G peak (AD/AG) was compared, the ratio was the highest as 2.51 in TKK HSA Pt/C, while the other TKK V Pt/C and JM Pt/C have the similar values of 2.26 and 2.27, respectively. This indicates that TKK HSA Pt/C has the most defective carbon support. When IrOx nanoparticles were deposited on the Pt/C catalysts, the defect ratio was changed. Interestingly, the AD/AG decreased to 2.05 for the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, which was even smaller than TKK V Pt-IrOx/C or JM Pt-IrOx/C. The carbon defects were covered by IrOx deposition and the residual defects were removed through successive heat treatment. The single cell was fabricated using bare Pt/C or Pt-IrOx/C as the anode catalyst with a metal loading of 0.1 mgPt cm−2. The Pt:Ir weight ratio was 2:1 in the Pt-IrOx/C. The metal content in the Pt-IrOx/C catalysts was measured as 68 wt%, 59 wt%, and 65 wt% for TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, TKK V Pt-IrOx/C, and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively, using TGA performed under air (Fig. S1). Fig. 3 a shows the single cell performance under H2/air flow at 65 °C using bare Pt/C as the anode catalyst. The TKK HSA Pt/C showed the lowest performance, with the highest ohmic resistance as confirmed by high frequency resistance (HFR) (Fig. S2). Typically, high surface area carbon support has many micropores. The BET isotherm in Fig. S3 confirmed that TKK HSA Pt/C has particularly large micropores with a high surface area of 419.9 m2/g (Table S1). Hysteresis was also observed implying ink-bottle-shaped pores with small pore entrances [37]. This pore structure often impeded mass transfer, resulting in low cell performance. However, the single cell performance of TKK HSA support was greatly enhanced after depositing IrOx nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3b. The maximum power density increased from 633 mW cm−2 to 754 mW cm−2. HFR also decreased significantly from ~18 mΩ to ~13 mΩ. TKK V or JM support showed relatively smaller changes. The tolerance of the anode catalyst upon H2 starvation was tested by switching the anode gas from H2 to Ar when Pt-IrOx/C catalysts were used, as shown in Fig. 3c. The cell voltage reversal tolerance was compared using the reversal time, which is the duration time after the gas switch until the cell voltage drops to −2.5 V. Although the defective carbon support typically shows poorer durability in PEMFC operation [31,38], the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C showed the longest reversal time of 44 h, indicating superior resistance against carbon corrosion upon H2 starvation. The reversal time was 21 h and 26.5 h for TKK V Pt-IrOx/C and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively. When the bare Pt/C was tested for the voltage reversal tolerance, the reversal time was only several min (Fig. S4). O2 and CO2 emission from the single cell were monitored using on-line mass spectroscopy during the reversal tolerance test. O2 was continuously produced in all the Pt-IrOx/C catalysts, indicating that water electrolysis occurred effectively. Whereas CO2 was hardly detected in the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C up to 20 h, much more CO2 emission was observed in TKK V Pt-IrOx/C or JM Pt-IrOx/C. Surely, CO2 emission is a strong indicator of the cell failure. 3.2 Origins of voltage reversal tolerance The oxidation state of the Pt and Ir was analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 4 . It is known that oxidic Ir is the active site for OER [39,40]. Fig. 4a shows that all the Pt-IrOx/C catalysts, which were treated at 300 °C for 2 h under air, have oxidic Ir surface as much as IrOx catalyst prepared by Adams fusion method. The Ir oxidation state did not change after the activation performed for 1 h, or after the reversal tolerance test. The OER activity was not severely damaged during fuel starvation, as confirmed by continuous O2 emission during the test. The as-made Pt-IrOx/C catalysts have oxidic Pt state (Fig. 4b), but the Pt was easily reduced upon the activation for 1 h. The oxidation state of Pt did not change after the reversal tolerance test. TEM images in Fig. S5 show that TKK HSA Pt/C has finely distributed Pt nanoparticles of which size is smaller than TKK V Pt/C or JM Pt/C. When the Pt size was estimated from Pt(200) peak of XRD data in Fig. S6b, the Pt size was 1.3 nm in TKK HSA Pt/C, 2.6 nm in TKK V Pt/C, and 3.6 nm JM Pt/C. As expected, more defective carbon could produce more finely distributed Pt nanoparticles. Because the as-made Pt-IrOx/C had oxidic Pt, the catalyst was slightly reduced at 65 °C for 1 h using 5% H2 flow, mimicking the electrochemical activation procedure. Assuming that all the Pt oxides were reduced, the size of IrOx was estimated from IrO2(211) peak at 54° in Fig. S6d to be 2.5 nm and 2.2 nm for TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively. The IrO2 peak of TKK V Pt-IrOx/C was too small, so its size could not be estimated. After the deposition of IrOx on the Pt/C, the Pt size increased slightly to 2.9 nm, 3.1 nm, and 3.7 nm for TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, TKK V Pt-IrOx/C, and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively. Both Pt and IrOx formed small nanoparticles on the Pt-IrOx/C catalysts. The Pt and Ir dispersion were further confirmed by TEM and HAADF-STEM images as shown in Fig. 5 . In the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C catalyst, Pt and Ir nanoparticles were finely distributed, covering the carbon support tightly. The TKK V Pt-IrOx/C or JM Pt-IrOx/C catalysts showed some unprotected carbon area. Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was estimated in Fig. S7. Because IrO2 has no hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) [41], it was supposed that the ECSA estimated by Hupd peak results from Pt. The Pt ECSA decreased after the IrOx deposition from 84 m2/gPt, 55 m2/gPt, and 60 m2/gPt in TKK HSA Pt/C, TKK V Pt/C, and JM Pt/C to 60 m2/gPt, 42 m2/gPt, and 47 m2/gPt in TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, TKK V Pt-IrOx/C, and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively. CO stripping was also performed as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S8. It was conducted in 0.1 M HClO4 solution to avoid the interference of HSO4 - anions in H2SO4 solution [42]. CO oxidation peak does not appear on IrO2 [28]. When the Pt ECSA was estimated from CO stripping peak area, it was 61 m2/gPt, 58 m2/gPt, and 59 m2/gPt in TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, TKK V Pt-IrOx/C, and JM Pt-IrOx/C, respectively. Whereas the ECSAs estimated from Hupd and CO stripping were consistent for the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C, the values were different for the TKK V Pt-IrOx/C and JM Pt-IrOx/C, with larger ECSA when estimated from CO stripping. The size of IrOx was smaller in these two cases, so the surface IrOx might be slightly reduced upon CO adsorption, with CO attached on reduced Ir [43]. Additionally, CO oxidation peak appears at the lower potential in the TKK HSA Pt/C as shown in Fig. 6b, indicating weaker interaction of metal surface with CO. CO can be produced as intermediate species upon carbon corrosion during fuel starvation and it can poison the OER catalyst further deteriorating the durability of the cell [44,45]. This weaker interaction with CO might also have contributed to the excellent reversal tolerance of the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C. HOR and OER activity was separately tested in a half-cell setup. All the bare Pt/C and Pt-IrOx/C catalysts showed similar HOR activity (Fig. 6c). The Pt-IrOx/C catalysts showed much better OER activity than the bare Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 6d), particularly, the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C showed the best OER activity. When the OER activity was compared with the physical mixture of the bare Pt/C and the IrOx synthesized by Adams fusion methods (Fig. S9), the Pt-IrOx/C still showed higher OER activity. The excellent tolerance of the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C against the cell voltage reversal upon H2 starvation, which was observed in Fig. 3b, is due to fine dispersion of IrOx covering carbon surface tightly, better CO tolerance, and better OER activity. 3.3 Effect of heat treatment temperature on reversal tolerance The TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C catalysts were treated at various temperatures under air, and the temperature effect was evaluated. According to TGA results in Fig. S10a, the metal content in the TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C was 57 wt%, 68 wt%, 77 wt% and 79 wt% when the catalyst was treated at 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. BET surface area decreased from 419.9 m2/g in the TKK HSA Pt/C to 262.0 m2/g, 193.4 m2/g, 148.2 m2/g, and 127.8 m2/g when the temperature for heat treatment was 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively (Fig. S10b and Table S2). The micropores were particularly removed. The single cell was fabricated with a metal loading of 0.1 mgPt cm−2 and 0.05 mgIr cm−2. The TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C catalyst treated at 300 °C showed the maximum power density of 754 mW cm−2, which is much higher than the value of 633 mW cm−2 for the TKK HSA Pt/C and is similar to the value of 758 mW cm−2 for the JM Pt/C (Fig. 7a). The HFR showed little difference for the various temperatures (Fig. S11a). When H2 was switched to Ar, the cell voltage dropped to −2.5 V in 4 h, 44 h, 53 h, and 40 h when the Pt-IrOx/C catalyst was treated at 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C, respectively (Fig. 7b). The catalyst treated at 350 °C showed even better reversal tolerance, although its maximum power density was slightly lower than the catalyst treated at 300 °C. The HOR and OER activity were also tested as shown in Fig. S11b and Fig. S11c, and they showed little difference for the various temperatures. The TEM, HAADF-STEM, and EDS mapping images in Fig. S12 show that metal nanoparticles were aggregated as the temperature increased. XPS data of Ir 4f and Pt 4f in Fig. S13 show that the metal oxidation state had little variation for the temperature. The surface Ir was oxidic, and its oxidation state did not change upon the activation for 1 h. The surface Pt was oxidic after the heat treatment, but it was easily reduced after the activation to metallic Pt. Based on XRD data in Fig. S14, the Pt size was estimated from Pt(200) peak as 2.8 nm, 2.9 nm, 3.7 nm and 3.5 nm for 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. The IrOx size was also estimated from IrO2(211) peak as 2.5 nm, 2.7 nm and 3.9 nm for 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. The IrO2(211) peak was too small for the catalyst treated at 250 °C, so its size could not be estimated. The Pt ECSA was estimated as 69 m2/gPt, 60 m2/gPt, 57 m2/gPt and 55 m2/gPt for 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. The ECSA decreased slightly as the temperature for heat treatment increased. 4 Conclusions When Ir nanoparticles were finely dispersed on defective Pt/C and oxidized, the resulting Pt-IrOx/C showed excellent tolerance against cell voltage reversal under H2 starvation. Whereas the defective Pt/C typically showed lower maximum power density and poorer stability due to surface oxygen species, the IrO2 nanoparticles could be anchored on the defective carbon, protecting the carbon better. The reversal tolerance time, which is the time when the cell voltage reaches −2.5 V under H2 starvation, was 44 h when Ir nanoparticles were deposited on TKK HSA Pt/C and oxidized at 300 °C. The continuous O2 emission under H2 starvation was confirmed by on-line mass spectroscopy. CO2 emission increased significantly prior to the cell failure. The TKK HSA Pt-IrOx/C showed the CO oxidation peak at lower potential and higher OER activity, indicating that it has better CO tolerance and better water removal capacity. The oxidation at the higher temperature destroyed the carbon excessively with severe particle aggregation. This work can provide a useful guideline to enhance the durability of the automobile PEMFCs in real driving condition.

        "dc:description": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) can utilize hydrogen with high efficiency without emitting pollutants. For the dissemination of the PEMFCs in the automotive industry, the stable automobile operation under transient conditions is important. Under fuel starvation, carbon oxidation can take place at the anode, reversing the cell voltage. By covering the carbon support with finely dispersed IrOx, the contact of carbon with water can be avoided minimizing carbon oxidation, instead, water is electrolyzed on the IrOx. Here, we deposited IrOx nanoparticles on the Pt/C with highly defective carbon. Contrary to the common belief that defective carbon is vulnerable to corrosion, the catalyst could endure better in the absence of H2, with the longest time of 44 h until reaching the cell voltage of −2.5 V. When the IrOx was immobilized on more defective carbon, the electrochemical surface area was higher, and the surface IrOx was more oxidic, resulting in higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and better CO tolerance. The carbon defects remaining after IrOx deposition were further removed by oxidizing the catalyst. The effect of the oxidation temperature was also examined.",
