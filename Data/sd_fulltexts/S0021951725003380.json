Graphical abstract Simultaneous coupling of solar-driven H2 evolution with pollution oxidation in the natural seawater is desirable for clean energy generation and seawater purification. However, common metal-based catalyst easily suffers from seawater corrosion, which can cause secondary pollution. Herein, a metal-free triptycene covalent polymer/g-C3N4 (TP-CN) catalyst was constructed by using an in-situ Suzuki coupling reaction. We compared plenty of pollutants in seawater for evaluation the photocatalytic H2 evolution performances under simulated light irradiation, in which for TP-CN catalyst, pollutant as proton provider leads to a low H2 production, yet pollutant that participates in oxidation reaction significantly enhances the activity. Particularly, TP-CN1 delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1) in seawater coupled with formic acid (FA), where FA consumes the photoinduced holes to form tiny CO and H2O. In-situ kineticexperiments and theory calculation exhibit that TP-CN heterojunction possesses an enhanced redox ability, and meanwhile FA in seawater stimulates more effective electrons compared with pure seawater and water. This work offers a valuable pathway for constructing extremely stable catalyst toward energy conversion and environmental conservation.

Seawater, as the most abundant natural resource, includes inorganic slat, organic matter, microorganism, and low concentration of pollution such as waste acid, alkali, organic solvent, etc., exists in the real seawater [5–7]. The generation of H2 from natural seawater can relieve the pressure from shortages of freshwater [8–11]. Especially, some reports found that real seawater has advantage over pure water in photocatalytic system. For instance, in our previous work, CDs-based catalyst exhibited a higher photocatalytic H2O2 production in real seawater compared with pure water [12,13]. As environmental pollution intensifies, these pollutants in natural seawater almost certainly will affect photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, such as whether they provide protons or redox effect. However, few studies have been reported about the effect of pollutants on photocatalytic seawater splitting to H2 production. Before a clear understanding of solar-driven seawater splitting to simultaneously produce H2 and utilize contamination, the development of a robust photo catalyst with high chemical stability that can withstand the harsh condition such as strong acid, serious corrosion, and high salinity is of great significance. Considering that metal-based catalyst tends to be corroded in the natural seawater, a metal-free photo catalyst is more stable which can effectively avoid the secondary water contamination, and thus it can be considered as an ideal choice for green and sustainable development of H2 production. As one of the most metal-free polymer semiconductors, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has received extensive attention in photocatalytic H2 generation due to its non-toxic, low-cost, appropriate band position and excellent chemical stability [14–16]. However, the H2 performance of bulk g-C3N4 is limited resulting from its low surface area and mobility of charge carriers. The integration of g-C3N4 with porous semiconductors is a promising way to improve the surface area and charge transfer. Triptycene-based microporous polymers with high surface area, strong covalent bonds and unique physicochemical properties, significantly promote the diffusion of H2 and stabilize the charge. Different from coordination polymers, triptycene-based polymers generally consisted of covalent bonds generate superior stability under realistic catalytic conditions (e.g. strong acid and base). In our previous reports, triptycene covalent polymer (TP) can remarkably improve the photocatalytic H2 activity of metal sulfides (e.g., CdS [17], Cd0.5Zn0.5S [18] and ZnIn2S4 [19]), yet metal sulfides could hardly apply to H2 production from seawater splitting, which inevitably suffer from the photocorrosion in the seawater system. Thus, taking the advantages of g-C3N4 and TP together, the construction of porous metal-free catalyst can predictably possess the high stability and accelerate the electron transfer, thus making full use of natural seawater to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a novel metal-free catalyst by using triptycene covalent polymer in-situ growth on the g-C3N4 (TP-CN) for the photocatalytic H2 production in the natural seawater. A large number of pollutants were examined to evaluate synergistically H2 generation. It is found that the pollutants as protons provider hardly afford the photocatalytic performance, yet the pollutants as redox provider significantly promote the H2 evolution. Especially, when formic acid (FA) acts as simulated waste acid in real seawater, the optimal TP-CN1 catalyst exhibits a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1, which is higher than that in pure water (1517.2 μmol h−1 g−1) and also superior to that with triethanolamine (TEOA) in real seawater (1879.3 μmol h−1 g−1). This metal-free catalyst exhibits a robust stability after ten cycles in seawater coupled with FA. Besides, the effects of TP loading as well as various salt ions on performance were studied. In-situ transient photovoltage (TPV) technology exhibits the reaction kinetics process during several ambient conditions, and meanwhile in-situ XPS spectra, in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal the charge transfer mechanism in TP-CN catalyst. This work paves a new route for the seawater utilization, catalyst design and sustainable energy development. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of triptycene-based polymer (TP) Without further purification, all the reagents used in the experiments were purchased from commercial sources. The 2,6,14-tribromotriptycene was synthesized according to our previous report [20,21], and generally triptycene-based polymer (TP) was synthesized through typical palladium-Suzuki coupling reaction. 1,4-phenyldiboronic acid (0.0108 g, 0.65 mmol), triphenylphosphine (0.0079 g, 0.03 mmol), 2,6,14-tribromotriene (0.2 g, 0.4 mmol), K2CO3 (0.4383 g, 3.1716 mmol), and Pd(OAc)2 (0.0029 g, 0.0128 mmol) were all stirred continuously at 65 °C. The gray precipitate was then thoroughly washed with THF and deionized water. 2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 (CN) The g-C3N4 powders (CN) were directly synthesized by heating melamine in a semi-enclosed environment. First, 10 g of melamine was first heated from room temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min in a Muffle furnace, and then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the yellow CN was obtained and grounded into powder. 2.3 Synthesis of triptycene-based polymer-g-C3N4 The TP-CN was synthesized by in situ Suzuki coupling reaction as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. Typically, 50 mg of CN, 50 mg of 2,6,14-tribromotriptycene, 27.2 mg of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid, 109.6 mg of K2CO3, 1.98 mg of triphenylphosphine, and 0.73 mg of Pd(OAc)2 were added in 20 mL of THF and 5 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous suspension. The above mixture was then heated for 12 h at 65 °C, which was constantly stirred. The light-yellow products were obtained after being repeatedly washed with THF and deionized water, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The as-prepared samples were marked as TP-CNx (x = 0.8, 1, 1.2 and 2), in which x represents the weight ratio of CN to TP. 2.4 Photocatalytic H2 generation measurement In a Pyrex flask (100 mL) with a closed gas circulation and cooling system, H2 was produced through photocatalytic water/seawater splitting. The seawater used was collected from the Bohai Sea (latitude 37°07′ and longitude 117°35′). The photocatalytic H2 production of metal-free photocatalysts was investigated by testing various organic and inorganic pollutants, including typical organic pollutants in wastewater (such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, isopropyl alcohol, phenol, triethanolamine, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and inorganic pollutants (such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid). Typically, 10 mg of the photocatalyst was added to 50 mL of deionized water or real seawater with pollutants, and the mixture was treated ultrasonically for 30 min. After degassing to remove air, the reaction was irradiated with light from a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter. The system temperature was maintained at 20 °C using a cooling water system. The amount of H2 produced was measured by gas chromatography (GC 7900, using high-purity nitrogen as the carrier gas) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Photocatalytic cycle experiments were conducted under similar conditions via the used catalyst instead of fresh catalyst. Especially, after 5 h of photocatalytic reaction, the used catalyst was centrifuged, washed, and then dried at 60 °C for next cycle test. 3 Results discussion 3.1 Material characterization The metal-free catalyst was prepared as displayed in Fig. 1a, in which the TP was in situ grown on the surface of CN to form an intimate heterointerface. To observe the microstructure of TP-CN, the SEM and TEM images are displayed in Fig. S1. Seen from SEM images, the bare TP presents the regular spherical morphology with an average size of 0.60 μm, while CN displays a stacked layered feature, in which its width is less than 4 μm. After TP is coated on the surface of CN by in-situ synthetic process, it is found that CN is tightly filled with TP layer instead of individual TP particles. The well dispersed TP onto the edge of CN suggests the fabrication of hierarchical heterostructure. From TEM image of TP-CN (Fig. S1), we can observe that, due to CN with the stacked sheet, the transparent TP is closely attached to the edge of CN. Since TP and CN belong to the polymer containing carbon, no obvious lattice fringes are observed from HR-TEM image [22]. Such heterostructure with intimate interfacial contact not merely exposes abundant catalytic sites, but promotes the electron transfer in the interface of catalysts. Additionally, the elemental distribution of TP-CN1 was measured using HAADF-STEM and corresponding element mapping images in Fig. 1b, revealing the uniform distribution of C and N elements, convincing the elemental compositions. The phase structures of CN and resulting TP-CN were investigated using XRD patterns (Figs. 1c and Fig. S2). The two distinct peaks at 12.9° and 27.5° in bare CN are indexed to (100) and (002) crystal planes, which is consistent with in-plane tri-s-triazine units and π-π interlayer stacking, respectively [23–25]. Due to TP with amorphous structure, all the TP-CN catalysts exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of CN, indicating that the g-C3N4 phase is intact during the preparation of TP. With the increase of TP loading, the peak intensity of CN is gradually weakened, which exhibits the increased content of amorphous component. The fine chemical structures of pristine TP and TP-CN are confirmed by the solid-state 13C NMR as displayed in Fig. 1d. The signal at 54 ppm in TP-based catalyst corresponds to the bridging carbon atoms belonging to the triptycene unit, and the peaks at 139 (144) and 123 (127) ppm are assigned to C=C in aromatic ring of triptycene unit and boronic acid, respectively. Especially, TP-CN exhibits the peaks including both TP and CN, where the new signals at 158 and 165 ppm are attributed to the inner and outer carbon ring in CN [26,27], respectively, indicative of the intact structure of TP-CN after in-situ synthesis reaction. The light absorption property of CN and modified TP-CN was investigated by UV–vis DRS spectra as exhibited in Figs. 1e and Figs. S3, S4. The bulk CN indicates a strong absorption in the visible-light range and the photo-absorption edge at about 470 nm, caused by the intrinsic π-π* transitions. As for pristine TP, the photo-absorption edge is located on nearby 425 nm, indicating a weak visible-light harvesting ability. Compared with bare TP, the TP-CN composites display an obvious red shift resulting from the reduced π-deficiency, which promotes the visible-light harvesting, thus resulting in more electron-hole pairs. As displayed in Fig. S5, the resulting band gap values (E g) of CN, TP and TP-CN are obtained from the Tauc plot of (αhν)1/2 versus (hν) [28], in which E g values of CN and TP are estimated to be 2.78 and 2.86 eV, respectively. The chemical structures of TP-CN catalysts are investigated by FT-IR spectra as present in Fig. S6. All catalysts display the broad bands at 3000–3600 cm−1 caused by N–H or O–H stretching peaks. The signal at 810 cm−1 belongs to the typical tri-s-triazine units of CN, and some vibration peaks at 1100–1680 cm−1 are attributed to the skeletal vibrations of C-N heterocycles [29]. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks at 1463 cm−1 are due to the skeleton vibration of aromatic ring, and meanwhile several bands at 2856–3090 cm−1 are assigned to C–H bond of TP [30]. Seen from FT-IR spectra of TP-CN, the peaks at 810–1463 cm−1 both existed in the composite, indicating the co-existence of TP and CN. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to verify the chemical components of TP-CN catalyst. The survey XPS spectra of TP and TP-CN catalyst both exhibit the co-existence of C, N and O elements with the calibration of C 1s (284.80 eV). In N 1s XPS spectrum of CN (Fig. 1f), the N species of C-N=C bonds (398.72 eV), N-(C)3 groups (400.20 eV) and amino groups (401.24 eV) can be observed [31]. Due to TP without N element, the TP-CN exhibits the similar N 1s peaks, yet the N 1s peaks for TP-CN have a slight shift toward the lower binding energy compared with pure CN, probably due to the re-distribution of charge caused by formation of built-in electric field between TP and CN. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of bare CN is fitted into two peaks at 284.80 and 288.45 eV (Fig. 1g), which could be attributed to the sp2 C–C bonds and N-C=N coordination, respectively [32,33]. Compared with CN, the peak intensity of sp2 C–C (284.80 eV) in TP-CN becomes stronger, indicating that the TP with unique C–C bond has an effect on the heterostructure. The O 1s spectra of CN and TP-CN display similar binding energies at 532.20 and 533.40 eV, due to adsorbed O2 (Oads) and H2O (–OH), respectively (Fig. S7b). Thus, the above results ascertain the successful synthesis of TP-CN with non-metal structure, demonstrating the strong interactions and effective electron transfer between TP and CN. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were acquired to investigate the structural porosity as well as pore distribution of TP, CN and TP-CN1 (Fig. 1h). It is clear that the pristine TP exhibits a type Ⅰ isotherm and its BET surface area is up to 1061 m2 g−1, in which a steep N2 gas uptake can be seen at the low relative pressure, illustrating that TP possesses the plentiful microporous structure [26]. Besides, a slight rise of curve at high relative pressure means a small amount of mesopores/macropores in TP caused by interparticle porosity. In contrast, the bare CN presents the type IV isotherm and a very low BET surface area of 13 m2 g−1, resulting from the severe agglomeration during polymerization process [34]. When the non-metal catalyst (TP-CN1) is constructed, the specific surface area is 310 m2 g−1, significantly higher than that of pure CN. The sorption curve of TP-CN obviously exhibits both the microporous section at the low relative pressure and mesopores/macropores at the high relative pressure, revealing the successful formation of this heterostructure. Additionally, the pore size distribution of TP displays the existence of abundant microporous structures, while the stacking macropore in CN is formed (Fig. S8). For TP-CN1, microporous and mesoporous structures are dominant. Such results highlight that TP-CN provides the much larger surface area and higher pore volume in comparison with bulk CN, which contributes to an increase in active sites and adsorption of reactant molecules. 3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production performance To investigate the potential application of metal-free photo catalysts systematically, a series of target pollutants are added in natural seawater to evaluate their H2 production under simulated solar irradiation (Fig. 2 a). Meanwhile, triethanolamine (TEOA) is used as sacrificial agent to compare these pollutants on the aspect of photocatalytic performance evaluation. We find an interesting phenomenon that when the pollutants that are protons as dominant effect, such as IPA, phenol, HCl and H2SO4, are added in the natural seawater, the H2 evolution rate of TP-CN1 is negligible. This result indicates that pollutants as proton source have no effect on this photocatalytic system. It is noted that, when the pollutions that are redox as dominant effect was introduced, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate over as-prepared TP-CN1 in natural seawater was significantly enhanced. Generally, TEOA as sacrificial agent consumes hole during the redox reaction, and TP-CN1 catalyst exhibits an enhanced H2 evolution rate of 1879.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in seawater. Except for TEOA, FA, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) exhibits a satisfactory photocatalytic performance, in which FA as hole sacrificial agent strongly stimulates the activity of TP-CN1. It can be seen that the H2 evolution rate of TP-CN1 in FA is up to 2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in seawater, which is much higher than that in TEOA. Besides, the TP-CN catalysts display the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in seawater than that in pure water. As a result, this metal-free catalyst in the common proton provider such as inorganic acid, phenol and IPA indicates almost no H2 evolution rate, and the performances of catalyst in the redox ability provider such as TEOA, FA, TFA and EDTA are satisfactory. As a result, the photocatalytic performances follow the order of FA > TEOA > TFA > EDTA > proton provider (IPA, phenol, HCl and H2SO4) both in water and seawater. As displayed in Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the saline and various ions in simulated seawater significantly promote the solar-driven H2 production of all as-prepared samples, especially for TP-CN heterostructure. For TP-CN1, a maximal photocatalytic H2 activity of 2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1 with FA in natural seawater is 1.5 times higher than that with TEOA (1879.3 μmol h−1 g−1) under the same condition. Besides, the photocatalytic performance is related to the ratio of TP to CN as displayed in Fig. 2c. The pure TP exhibits a negligible H2 evolution rate caused by its poor light absorption ability and the CN also presents the low photocatalytic activity of 222 μmol h−1 g−1 in natural seawater, resulting from the fast charge recombination. After TP modifying, the photocatalytic performance of TP-CN is dramatically improved, and particularly, the H2 evolution rate of optimal TP-CN1 is 12.7 times higher than that of bare CN under the same condition. Due to the shielding effect caused by inactive TP, the excessive TP on CN results in the low H2 production compared with TP-CN1. Since the H2 production from natural seawater splitting is higher than that from pure water splitting over as-prepared metal-free catalysts, it is necessary to investigate the effects of different metal ions in natural seawater on the photocatalytic performance with FA (Fig. 2d). The main cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) are existed in the natural seawater, and then the photocatalytic reaction was performed on the presence of representative NaCl, KBr, KCl, CaCl2, Na2SO4, and MgCl2 aqueous solutions. Except for Ca2+ cations, Cl- anions including NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 exhibit the obviously increased photocatalytic H2 generation compared with pure water, indicating that Cl- favourably improves the photocatalytic activity. It is noticed that the H2 evolution rate of single saline solution is lower than that of natural seawater, which reveals that the co-existing components and other impurities in natural seawater could facilitate the photo generated charge transfer of photo catalysts. Besides, the dominant component NaCl is not the only determinant for the H2 evolution of TP-CN in natural seawater, and other ions such as KCl and KBr also play an important role in increased performance. The stability over TP-CN catalyst as another significant index is crucial for its practical application (Fig. 2e). Recycling experiments of pure water and natural seawater splitting were conducted to detect the durability of metal-free catalyst. After ten cycles, the performances of TP-CN1 have no obvious change in both pure water and natural seawater, indicating that the catalyst remains stable. The phase structure and chemical state of TP-CN1 after the circular reaction were investigated through XRD, TEM and XPS spectra as shown in Figs. S10–S12, no significant changes with catalysts in XRD, TEM and XPS confirm the good photo/chemical stability. The AQE for TP-CN1 catalyst in natural seawater was measured under several fixed wavelengths to investigate the utilization efficiency of photoinduced charge as displayed in Fig. 2f. It indicates that the wavelength at 365 nm generates the highest AQE of 3.59 % in natural seawater. Besides, the AQE values at the wavelength of 420, 450 and 500 nm correspond to 1.83 %, 0.20 % and 0.07 %, respectively. It is worth noting that AQE values of TP-CN at different wavelengths are consistent with the light absorption curve, demonstrating that the high AQE and enhanced photocatalytic performances are attributed to the light absorption ability as well as the rational metal-free catalysts. The enhanced H2 production performance of TP-CN and its outstanding stability can be ascribed to the stable chemical structure, rich pore structure and enhanced interaction effect. Besides, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of TP-CN1 is also influenced by the concentration of FA with other condition constant (Fig. 2g). With the increase of FA concentration, the H2 evolution rate is increased to 2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in natural seawater which is attributed to the favourable protonation and enhanced HCOO– concentration, thus boosting the redox reaction. However, the excessive FA concentration with lower pH value makes decomposition of FA sluggish, and meanwhile leads to the formation of solid sodium formate more easily, which certainly will reduce the H2 evolution rate of TP-CN catalyst. The above analysis verifies that the superior photocatalytic activity highly depends on the effect of FA on oxidation half-reaction. Besides, it is noted that tiny CO product is detected accompanied by primary product H2. To further study the decomposed liquid product of FA, deuterated formic acid (DCOOD) instead of FA is introduced into the photocatalytic system (Fig. 2h). The appearance of D2O confirms that FA decomposes into H2O and CO through redox reaction. 3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism To study the charge recombination efficiency and carrier lifetime, steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra of the non-metal reaction system were performed. The bulk CN exhibits one distinct PL emission peak at 470 nm (Fig. 3 a), in agreement with the bandgap emission, while the PL intensity of TP-CN1 rapidly decreases after the TP is added, indicating that TP can lead to the lower charge recombination of the heterostructure [35]. To explore the charge separation dynamics, Fig. 3b exhibits the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of CN and TP-CN1, and the average lifetime (τave) of TP-CN1 (2.06 ns) is smaller than that of CN (2.72 ns) caused by decreased photo-exciton dissociation, which benefits the charge migration [36]. The photoelectrochemical properties of TP-CN catalysts were studied to explore the recombination as well as charge transport behaviour. The photocurrent of TP, CN and TP-CN with five light on–off cycles is displayed in Fig. 3c. The photocurrent density of TP-CN1 is much higher than that of pristine CN and TP, strongly illustrating that incorporation of TP into CN can efficiently promote the generation and migration of photo excited charge [37]. Furthermore, the EIS Nyquist diagrams of TP, CN, TP-CN1 are in accord with the results of photocurrent (Fig. 3d). TP-CN1 exhibits the smallest semicircle compared with bare TP and CN, revealing that this metal-free catalyst can reduce the interfacial charge-transfer resistance [38]. The above results indicate that the synergetic effect of TP and CN can provide a faster electron transfer at the heterojunction interface of TP-CN1, thereby facilitating the performance and stability of CN for target H2 production from seawater. The flat band potential (E fb) of CN and TP can be measured by Mott-Schottky (M−S) plots to determine the energy band positions. As present in Fig. 3e–f, the positive slopes obtained by M−S plots with different frequencies illustrate that TP and CN are both n-type semiconductor [39]. The E fb values of CN and TP are determined as −0.95 and −1.50 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, according to the x-axis intercepts of extrapolated linear part. The equation E NHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.197 is used to convert the NHE scale, in which the E fb values of CN and TP are −0.75 and −1.30 V (vs. NHE), respectively. It is widely accepted that the deviation between E fb and conduction band (E CB) is negligible for n-type semiconductor. Accordingly, the valence band (E VB) values of CN and TP are 2.03 and 1.56 V (vs. NHE) based on E g obtained by Tauc plots [40]. To further investigate the phenomenon of spatial charge separation in CN and TP-CN1 under light irradiation, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images of CN and TP-CN1 were illustrated in Fig. 3g–m. It can be seen that there is no obvious difference in the surface charge of CN before and after illumination. In contrast, the surface potential of the TP-CN1 is decreased by 14 mV after illumination, suggesting that photogenerated electrons are rapidly increased on this catalyst [41,42]. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a trapping agent to determine the charge transfer mechanism in TP-CN catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4 a–c, the DMPO∼•O2 – signals of CN, TP, and TP-CN1 are observed, demonstrating that all the catalysts possess the ability to produce •O2 – species [43]. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, the EPR spectrum of DMPO∼•OH for TP shows no signal, as its potential is below the •OH/OH– potential (1.99 V vs NHE) [44,45]. Importantly, DMPO∼•OH signals are detected both in CN and TP-CN1, which suggests that the photoexcited holes remain on more higher potential of CN. Furthermore, TP-CN1 catalyst exhibits the stronger signals of DMPO∼•O2 – and DMPO∼•OH compared with individual component, suggesting that the charge transfer is in accord with Z-scheme mechanism, and redox ability is significantly enhanced after formation of TP-CN heterojunction [46]. Besides, as shown in Fig. 4g–h the interfacial interaction as well as charge transfer mechanism between TP and CN was explored by using in-situ XPS analysis. Although only a tiny shift has occurred in the binding energies of C 1s in TP-CN1 under light illumination, the binding energy of N 1s for TP-CN1 moves to higher binding energies of 400.45 and 401.40 eV after illumination, which suggests that photoexcited electrons depart from CN through the interfacial interaction [47–49]. Thus, we propose the charge transfer mechanism as displayed in Fig. 4i. A built-in electric field (IEF) established at the interface drives the electron transfer from TP to CN. Under the effect of IEF and band bending, the TP-CN catalyst follows the Z-scheme mechanism, where electrons in the E CB of CN consume the holes in the HOMO of TP, and electrons and holes remain in the LUMO of TP and E VB of CN respectively, thus realizing the higher redox ability. Transient photo voltage (TPV) experiments were used to understand the charge transport dynamic process of TP, CN and TP-CN catalyst under water, seawater and seawater with FA conditions, respectively, and the original TPV curves are displayed in Fig. 5 a–c. According to Fig. S14 under seawater with FA condition, the constructed heterojunction has little effect on the charge extraction rate (tmax), because the tmax value of TP-CN1 (0.2166 ms) is higher than that of TP (0.1171 ms). However, maximum photogenerated charge extraction (A) value of TP-CN1 (0.4374) is higher than that of TP (0.1419), and the attenuation constant (τ) that represents charge recombination process of TP-CN1 is much higher than that of TP and CN in seawater with FA, indicating that the formation of metal-free heterojunction can effectively inhibit the charge recombination [50,51]. Besides, the effective charge extraction amount (Aeff) based on the formula A·τ/tmax is calculated and listed in Tables S3–S5. TP-CN1 catalyst possesses the enhanced effective electron concentration (0.7754) compared with TP (0.5476) and CN (0.0198) under the similar condition (seawater with FA), exhibiting that there are more photo generated electrons existed in TP-CN1 rather than individual component [52,53]. From the TPV curves of TP-CN1 under water, seawater, and seawater with FA as displayed in Fig. 5d–f, it can be seen that although the tmax of TP-CN1 in seawater with FA is higher than that in water and seawater. A value of TP-CN1 in seawater with FA is remarkably enhanced compared with that in water and seawater. Especially, τ value of TP-CN1 in seawater with FA is further significantly improved, due to the photo generated holes consumed by FA, which can promote the separation efficiency of charge [54]. As a result, the Aeff of TP-CN1 in seawater with FA (0.7754) is noticeably high compared to the other two conditions (0.0833 water, 0.3424 seawater) (Fig. 5g), which is consistent with photocatalytic performance, also well explaining the superior activity of TP-CN in seawater with FA system (Fig. 5h). DFT calculations are used to understand the electron distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals and electron rearrangement at heterogeneous interfaces. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which are respectively associated with bonding and antibonding orbitals, are related to the distribution of holes and electrons upon photo-excitation. LUMO is capable of accepting electrons, and a lower LUMO value is more conducive to the acceptance of external electrons, signifying enhanced ability to capture electrons from other entities [55]. Apparently, in comparison with TP, CN exhibits a lower unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO) (Fig. 6 a left). This implies that CN has a significantly superior ability to capture electrons compared to TP. As depicted in the electrostatic potential (ESP) diagrams (Fig. 6a right, Fig. S15), as compared to that of TP, CN displays a pronounced electrophilic behaviour, and it shows more regions of red colour to represent having more electron-deficient regions, which can be used as an electron acceptor for easy access to electrons. While TP shows more regions of bule colour representing more electron-rich regions, which can be used more easily as an electron donor [56]. Consequently, it can be postulated that when CN forms a heterogeneous interface with TP, CN is highly likely to acquire electrons from TP, thereby inducing electron rearrangement at the interface. This conclusion was further confirmed by the charge difference. From the charge density difference of CN-TP (Fig. 6b), it is found that the redistribution of electron density occurs in the heterointerface resulting in the establishment of IEF, where the description of electron accumulation/consumption is displayed as yellow/cyan, respectively [57–61]. As a result, these experiments and DFT calculation provide direct evidence on the charge transfer pathways of TP-CN catalyst (Fig. 6c). Driven by IEF and interfacial band bending effects, the photoinduced electrons and holes remain in the LUMO of TP and E VB of CN, respectively, thereby boosting their separation and maintaining their high redox capacity. On the other hand, FA plays a role of oxidizing holes instead of providing protons, which further promote photo generated electron and holes separation during the H2 production process. 4 Conclusions In this work, we developed an efficient metal-free TP-CN photo catalyst with improved performance for cooperative H2 generation and simulated pollutant oxidation. TP-CN with only C and N elements possesses high surface area to expose more active catalytic sites and inhibits the corrosion by salts and pollutants in seawater. TP-CN catalyst indicates remarkably improved H2 evolution rate in the seawater with the pollutant as sacrificial agent, while when pollutant offers the protons, the metal-free catalyst has no performance. As a consequence, the optimal TP-CN1 exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in real seawater consisted of FA, where FA can consume the photo generated holes to produce CO and H2O. According to the in-situ TPV curves, we find that the effective electron concentration (Aeff) of TP-CN in real seawater is much higher than in pure water, and after introduction of FA, the effective electrons are further increased, indicating that FA consumes the photo generated holes which can markedly accelerate the charge separation. Besides, in-situ XPS, in-situ EPR, KPFM, and DFT calculation validate the Z-scheme mechanism existed in TP-CN, which can suppress the charge recombination and facilitate electron transport. This study provides deeper insights for construction of metal-free photo catalysts for cooperative coupling of seawater purification and H2 production.

        "dc:description": "Simultaneous coupling of solar-driven H2 evolution with pollution oxidation in the natural seawater is desirable for clean energy generation and seawater purification. However, common metal-based catalyst easily suffers from seawater corrosion, which can cause secondary pollution. Herein, a metal-free triptycene covalent polymer/g-C3N4 (TP-CN) catalyst was constructed by using an in-situ Suzuki coupling reaction. We compared plenty of pollutants in seawater for evaluation the photocatalytic H2 evolution performances under simulated light irradiation, in which for TP-CN catalyst, pollutant as proton provider leads to a low H2 production, yet pollutant that participates in oxidation reaction significantly enhances the activity. Particularly, TP-CN1 delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (2821.3 μmol h−1 g−1) in seawater coupled with formic acid (FA), where FA consumes the photoinduced holes to form tiny CO and H2O. In-situ kineticexperiments and theory calculation exhibit that TP-CN heterojunction possesses an enhanced redox ability, and meanwhile FA in seawater stimulates more effective electrons compared with pure seawater and water. This work offers a valuable pathway for constructing extremely stable catalyst toward energy conversion and environmental conservation.",
