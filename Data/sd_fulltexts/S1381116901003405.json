Syngas adsorptions at 1.2MPa and room temperature on a precipitated cobalt catalyst reduced by H2 and on that used for high-pressure FT synthesis were studied by diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. The syngas adsorption on the freshly reduced sample gives rise to two weak bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1, which are assigned to linear adsorption of CO on metallic cobalt particles. The bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 sharply increase by heating the sample after performing syngas adsorption for over 1h, up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow. However, the intensities of the bands begin to reduce once the temperature remained constant. The increase of the bands during the heating may be attributed to recombination of the dissociated CO on the catalyst. High ability of the sample for CO dissociation indicates that fine metallic cobalt particles have been formed on the surface. Syngas adsorption on the sample after use for FT synthesis gives rise to two strong bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, and several weak bands at 2150, 2025, 1897 and 1822cm−1. These bands do not increase while heating the sample to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow, indicating low ability of the sample for CO dissociation; so large particles have been formed on the surface. The bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 are assigned to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides; the bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 may be associated with sintered metallic cobalt species and the band at 2150cm−1 due to Co2+ species. The features of the high-pressure syngas adsorption indicate that, during FT synthesis, fine metallic cobalt particles on the surface are gradually transformed to a mixture of cobalt carbides, sintered metallic cobalt and small amount of cobalt oxides. Keywords FTIR Syngas adsorption Cobalt catalyst FT synthesis Microstructure 1 Introduction Iron and cobalt-based catalysts are FT synthesis catalysts most commonly used. The morphological changes of the catalysts have been well studied for the purpose of understanding the catalytic property-structure relationship. It is now widely accepted that the composition of iron-based catalysts undergoes significant changes during the reactions, and that the formation of iron carbides always occurs to constitute the active sites for FT synthesis [1–4]. On the other hand, cobalt has a lesser tendency to produce carbides than Fe. The active components on cobalt catalysts are usually considered to remain in metallic states during FT synthesis [5–8]. Recently, however, Ducreux et al. [9] observed the formation of cobalt carbides on a supported cobalt catalyst during FT synthesis by in situ XRD, which was also related with the deactivation process of the sample. These observations have been supported by Tihay et al. [10], who reported that when an Fe–Co-based catalyst is used for FT synthesis, metallic Co particles on the surface are partly transformed to carbides, as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations. Cobalt species are usually observed to exist as the metallic phase during FT synthesis; those observations may suggest small sizes and low concentration of the cobalt carbide particles formed during the reaction. It was also found [9,10] that those cobalt carbides are unstable, which were decomposed to metallic cobalt and polymeric carbon easily, so that they have rarely been observed by ex situ techniques. Therefore, it may be favorable to identify cobalt carbides by using some surface-sensitive experimental techniques and by in situ investigations of the catalysts after performing FT synthesis. We have recently investigated the high-pressure syngas adsorption on reduced and used iron catalysts by in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR [11]. The adsorption of CO on metallic iron particles and that on iron carbides can be clearly distinguished. Syngas adsorption on the cobalt species may be comparable to that on the iron species. Although the adsorption properties of oxidized and freshly reduced cobalt-based catalysts have been widely investigated [12–19], regarding to the cobalt catalyst used for high-pressure FT synthesis; however, nearly no infrared data are available. In order to elucidate the morphological changes during high-pressure FT synthesis, including whether or not cobalt carbides are formed, we characterized in the present work the processes of high-pressure syngas adsorption on freshly reduced cobalt catalyst and on that used for FT synthesis from syngas at different temperatures. In situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy is applied to investigations of the syngas adsorption. The characterizations after catalytic test give information about the transformation of fine metallic cobalt phase into a mixture of cobalt carbides, sintered metallic particles and small amount of cobalt oxides. 2 Experimental The precipitated cobalt oxide sample used in this work was prepared in the usual batch-wise manner by adding ammonia solution into a solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O. The obtained precipitates were washed with deionized water, followed by drying at 120°C for 12h and calcination in air at 350°C for 4h. The diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra were recorded with a resolution of 4cm−1 and accumulation of 20 on a Bio-Rad FTS 6000 FTIR spectrometer supplied with a MCT detector and a diffuse reflectance attachment. The infrared cell with ZnSe windows (Spectra-Tech Inc.) can be performed at high pressures and high temperatures. One set of stainless steel gas lines was connected to the cell, which allows in situ reduction and FT synthesis followed by high-pressure syngas adsorption. For performing FTIR measurements, the oxidized samples were in situ reduced at 300°C and atmospheric pressure in a flow of ultrahigh purity (>99.999%) H2 used as supplied. In situ high-pressure FT synthesis on the reduced sample was performed in a syngas flow (H2/CO=2.0) at 1.2MPa, 200 and 240°C, respectively. High-pressure syngas adsorption on the reduced and used samples was performed in the syngas flow at 1.2MPa and room temperature. The syngas was also an ultrahigh purity one (>99.999%), which was used as supplied. He (>99.999%) used for flushing and thermal desorption of the adsorbed species was further purified by passing it through a deoxy trap. The gas flows were maintained at 60mlmin−1 by mass flow control meters. Approximately 25mg of powder sample was used for each experiment. Powder XRD patterns of the catalyst samples were obtained on a Miniflex diffractometer (Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation with a Ni filter. Cobalt phases were detected by comparing diffraction patterns with those in the standard powder XRD file compiled by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards published by the International Center for Diffraction Data. The reduced and used samples were passivated in a stream of 1% O2/He at room temperature before being transferred from the reactor for XRD measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 High-pressure syngas adsorption on freshly reduced cobalt catalyst samples Freshly in situ H2-reduced cobalt sample was subjected to the adsorption experiment in a syngas flow (H2/CO=2, 60mlmin−1) at 1.2MPa and room temperature. Fig. 1 A shows the spectra recorded with time after raising pressure to 1.2MPa, from which only very weak bands can be observed until syngas adsorption for 15h. The spectrum attached in the Fig. 1A is the amplified one of Fig. 1A(d), referencing to the spectrum recorded at the initial 15s of the syngas adsorption. From which two bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 can be clearly observed. According to the literature [12,16,18,19], the bands in the region of 2050–1980cm−1 are usually associated with the stretching modes of linear carbonyl on zero-valent Co. Therefore, the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 can be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on tops of metallic cobalt particles. Since the adsorption is performed at the high pressure of 1.2MPa, any bands due to CO adsorption on Co δ+ (0<δ≤2), which should appear in the region of 2050–2180cm−1 [12,15,17,20], would be hidden in the very strong bands of gaseous CO and therefore difficult to detect. The adsorption experiment was reproduced and after syngas adsorption was performed for 1h, the sample was quickly heated up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow. The spectra recorded after the temperature reached 100°C are shown in Fig. 1B. By increasing the temperature up to 100°C, the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 become very stronger. The spectrum attached on Fig. 1B is the amplified one of Fig. 1B(a), referencing to the same spectrum as used for the amplified spectrum attached in Fig. 1A. It is seen that the bands become about 10 times as strong as those on the amplified spectrum shown in Fig. 1A. The spectra in Fig. 1B also indicate that, with remaining temperature at 100°C, however, the intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 gradually decrease in the syngas flow. By a careful inspection, it is found that raising temperature in the range of about 50–130°C will lead to obvious increase in intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1; whereas the intensities of the bands become reduced once the temperature is remained constant. These results suggest that the tremendous increases of the bands during the raising temperature should not be due to further adsorption of gaseous CO molecules on the catalyst surface. To further elucidate the cause for the significant increase in intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 by raising temperature in the high-pressure syngas flow, more investigations have been performed. It is found that, as displayed in Fig. 2 , while the syngas adsorption is performed at 1.2MPa and 100°C, only two weak bands are evolved at 2013 and 2033cm−1 after syngas adsorption for 3h. The intensities of the bands are even lower than those of the bands in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 3 , it is also found that heating the sample up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow, after performing syngas adsorption at room temperature for 20min, produces a small increase of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1. On the other hand, while the sample is heated after syngas adsorption at room temperature for 15h, a tremendous increase in intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 is observed. These results clearly indicate that the increases of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 during raising temperature have close correlation with the previous high-pressure syngas adsorption at room temperature. The above results may be explained as that, during the syngas adsorption at room temperature, large amounts of CO molecules are dissociatively adsorbed on the reduced cobalt sample, which can not be detected by FTIR; with raising temperature, the surface carbon and oxygen atoms from dissociated CO recombine to form CO molecules, which are thereafter molecularly adsorbed on the surface and can be detected by FTIR. When the syngas adsorption is performed at room temperature for longer times, more CO molecules become adsorbed on the catalyst surface; therefore, larger increases in intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 are observed by raising temperature up to 100°C. The above speculation is confirmed by flashing measurement in a helium flow as well. After the reduced cobalt sample was subjected to the high-pressure syngas adsorption at room temperature for 1h, pressure was reduced to atmospheric pressure and then syngas was replaced by helium. The bands of gaseous CO disappear by simple helium flushing for about 0.5min. The flashing was carried out after helium flushing for 3min; at this moment no gaseous CO exists in the system. The spectra presented in Fig. 4 are those recorded before and after flashing the sample in the helium flow. The spectra shown are referencing to the spectrum recorded at the end of hydrogen reduction before sample is exposed to syngas. From Fig. 4, it is observed that flashing to 100°C in the helium flow results in an obvious increase in intensities of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1. It is also observed that these bands thereafter quickly diminish and almost disappear in about 2min. Combining the results from quickly raising temperature in the high-pressure syngas flow and the results from He flashing, it can be concluded that, during desorption from the surface, parts of the dissociative CO molecules may go through the molecularly adsorption states, in this step increasing in the CO bond strength and, therefore, being detected by FTIR with the same frequencies as the molecularly adsorbed CO molecules [21]. The recombined CO molecules are slowly desorbed in the high-pressure syngas flow. Upon helium flashing at atmospheric pressure the desorption becomes very fast. The recombination of dissociated CO has rarely been observed in literature, which may be due to the fact that CO adsorption on cobalt catalysts are usually performed at low pressures, such as <100Torr, and therefore, desorption of the recombined CO occurs very faster. It has been reported from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses [22–24] that, on crystalline iron surface, CO adsorbs molecularly at low temperatures such as −150°C. The adsorbed CO molecules desorb sequentially at elevated temperatures and dissociate on the sample at above 100°C. The dissociated carbon and oxygen atoms will recombine to CO molecules and desorb from the surface at above 500°C. On this work, the temperatures for CO dissociation and for the dissociated carbon and oxygen atoms to recombine to CO molecules are both greatly reduced in comparison with the results for crystalline iron. Therefore, the catalyst samples have relatively higher capability for CO dissociation; which indicate that those metallic cobalt particles formed on the surfaces are fine ones. On the spectra shown in Fig. 4, which were recorded after syngas was adsorbed for 1h and then high pressure syngas was replaced by a helium flow at atmospheric pressure, no bands due to CO adsorption on Co2+ and Co1+ species are observed, therefore, most of the cobalt species on the surface have been converted to metallic phase by the hydrogen reduction. This result is in agreement with the data from X-ray photograph spectroscopy [25]. Jiang et al. [18] reported that while the cobalt sample is reduced in hydrogen at 300°C and 1.2MPa, syngas adsorption on the reduced sample gives bands at 2080 and 2050cm−1, which are assigned to CO adsorption on Co δ+ (0<δ<2) and oxygen-rich Co0 sites, respectively. Therefore, hydrogen reduction at low pressure, as used in this work, favors to complete reduction of the oxidized cobalt species. 3.2 High-pressure syngas adsorption on the reduced cobalt catalyst used for FT synthesis at 200 °C To investigate the morphological changes of the reduced cobalt catalyst during FT synthesis, the sample used for in situ FT synthesis from syngas was also subjected to the experiment of high-pressure syngas adsorption. The FT synthesis was performed for 6h at 1.2MPa, 200 and 240°C, respectively. After the reactions, the samples were cooled to room temperature in the high-pressure syngas flow. While the FT synthesis was performed at 1.2MPa and 200°C, the sample was less active and, according to FTIR observations, water and hydrocarbons were formed. The spectra recorded after cooling the sample to room temperature (<30°C) are presented in Fig. 5 A. It is observed that the syngas adsorption gives rise to two strong bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 and two weak bands at 1897 and 1822cm−1. The intensities of the bands slowly enhance with adsorption time. The above experiment was reproduced and, after syngas adsorption for 1h, the sample was quickly heated up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow. The spectra recorded after the temperature reached 100°C are shown in Fig. 5B. Four bands at 1999, 2021 2013, and 2033cm−1 are clearly observed. In comparison with the spectra recorded before raising temperature (Fig. 5A), two more bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 appear. The ratio of Fig. 5B(a) to Fig. 5A(c) is presented in Fig. 6 a, from which two minus bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 can be clearly observed. However, the intensities of the bands become obviously reduced compared to those for the freshly reduced sample (attached of Fig. 1B). The spectrum shown in Fig. 6b is the ratio of Fig. 5B(b) to Fig. 5B(a), on which apparently four plus bands at 1999, 2021 2013, and 2033cm−1 are observed. Therefore, adsorbed CO species are gradually desorbed from the surface at the elevated temperature. For correctly assigning the weak bands at 1897 and 1822cm−1, it is useful to note that the adsorbed species responsible for the broadband at 1897cm−1 are also desorbed during heating and remaining the sample at 100°C, whereas the adsorbed species responsible for the broadband at 1822cm−1 do not desorb from the surface. Helium flushing of the adsorbed species at atmospheric pressure followed by thermal desorption up to 300°C was also performed after syngas adsorption for 1h. A few spectra are shown in Fig. 7 . Only a small decrease in intensities of the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 was observed after helium flushing for 3min. With elimination of strong bands due to gaseous CO, a broad band at about 2150cm−1 is seen. The results from thermal desorption experiment indicate that nearly no increase is observed for the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 by raising temperature up to 100°C; the bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 begin to diminish at about 100°C and disappear at about 150°C. With elimination of the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, a broad band at about 2025cm−1 can be observed. The bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 do not disappear with raising temperature up to 300°C. Syngas adsorption on the used cobalt sample gives rise to a new set of bands, and the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 become very weaker compared with those for the freshly reduced sample. These results indicate that significant changes in microstructure have occurred during the reaction. Fine metallic cobalt particles formed by hydrogen reduction are partially transformed during the FT synthesis; and the new-formed species exhibit significantly low ability for CO dissociation. According to the literature [12–14], the weak band at 2150cm−1 should be assigned to CO adsorption on Co2+ centers. These observations indicate that small amount of metallic cobalt species was oxidized, which may be due to the formation of water and CO2 on the surface during FT synthesis [26]. The bands in the region of 1900–1800cm−1 have been assigned to bridged CO on Co0 species [12,16]. As shown above, during the thermal desorption experiment in the helium flow, the broad bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 do not disappear with raising temperature up to 300°C, while the bands at 2021, 1999 and 1822cm−1 vanish with raising temperature up to 150°C. Therefore, these bands may be assigned to two kinds of Co0 species, respectively. The surface species responsible for the bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 exhibits high thermal stability and strong binding strength with the adsorbed CO. Therefore, it may be a new kind of sintered metallic cobalt phase formed during the reaction, which can connect with adsorbed CO to form stable sub carbonyl species. On the other hand, the strong doublet bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 and the weak broad band at 1897cm−1 may be assigned to linear and bridging adsorption of CO on cobalt carbides, respectively. The main reasons for assigning the bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides may be summarized below. (1) The formation of cobalt carbides during FT synthesis has been demonstrated by in situ XRD and HRTEM analyses [9,10]; it is probable that syngas adsorption on the used samples arise bands due to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides. (2) The bands in the region of 2040–1800cm−1 have been due to CO adsorptio on Co0 species [12,16–19], cobalt carbides are Co0 species [10,27,28], so the bands of CO adsorption on cobalt carbides should appear in this region as well. (3) According to the literature [12,15–20,29], the features of CO adsorption on cobalt-based catalysts and those on iron-based catalysts are similar. For example, CO adsorption on Fe δ+ or Co δ+ (0<δ≤2) gives bands in the region of 2200–2050cm−1; on Fe0 or Co0 species linear CO appears in 2050–1980cm−1 and bridged CO appears in 1900–1700cm−1. It was revealed in our previous work [11] that on freshly H2-reduced iron catalyst syngas adsorption arises weak bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1; and that on the same sample used for high-pressure FT synthesis syngas adsorption gives two very strong bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, which are assigned to CO adsorption on iron carbides. So, in this work, the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 might be assigned to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides as well. (4) The another possible assignment of the surface species correlated with the bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 may be some aggregated metallic cobalt phase transformed from the fine metallic cobalt particles. However, as described later in this paper, the surface species associated with the bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 is unstable, which can be converted back to fine metallic cobalt species by helium treatment at 100°C. Therefore, the assignment is denied because any aggregated metallic cobalt phase formed during the FT synthesis is more stable than those fine metallic particles on the freshly reduced sample. 3.3 High-pressure syngas adsorption on the reduced catalyst after use for high-pressure FT synthesis at 240 °C While the freshly H2-reduced sample was used for FT synthesis at 1.2MPa and 240°C, the sample was rather active. After reaction for 6h, the sample was cooled to room temperature in the syngas flow to perform high-pressure syngas adsorption. The spectra recorded are displayed in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8, syngas adsorption on the used sample gives rise to two strong bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, and two weak bands at 1897 and 1822cm−1. The spectra are similar to those from syngas adsorption on the sample after use for FT synthesis at 200°C, but the intensities of the bands become significantly stronger. The experiment was reproduced and after syngas adsorption for 1h, the sample was quickly heated up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow. By this way, however, no bands are observed at 2013 and 2033cm−1 (the data are not shown). The data from thermal desorption experiment are shown in Fig. 9 . The bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 are not observed as well; and the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 remain unchanged by raising temperature to 100°C. With further increasing temperature, the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 begin to diminish and vanish at about 200°C; the band at 1897cm−1 disappears simultaneously. Therefore, the adsorbed CO molecules become more closely bound on the cobalt carbide particles in comparison with those on the sample after use for FT synthesis at 200°C. It is observed once again that the broad bands at 2150, 2025 and 1822cm−1 do not disappear until raising the temperature up to 300°C. Elimination of the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 reveals complete disappearance of the fine metallic cobalt particles from the surface. In the meantime, it is also observed that more sintered metallic cobalt species and cobalt carbides are formed. Therefore, almost all of the fine metallic cobalt particles on the surface have been transformed to sintered metallic cobalt species, cobalt carbides and small amount of cobalt oxide by performing FT synthesis at elevated temperature. The temperatures for adsorbed CO molecules to desorb from the surface of cobalt carbide particles become significantly higher, which may indicate large sizes of the particles. Syngas adsorption on the cobalt samples used for FT synthesis reveals the formation of cobalt carbides on the surfaces. However, in comparison with the data of syngas adsorption on used iron samples [11], the bands due to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides are obviously weaker than those due to CO adsorption on iron carbides. In addition, during syngas adsorption on used iron samples, no bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 were observed. These results demonstrate that cobalt species have a lesser tendency to form carbides than the iron species. It was also observed that, after the cobalt sample utilized for the FT synthesis at 1.2MPa, 240°C for 6h is treated in a helium flow at 100°C, syngas adsorption on the treated sample gives rise to weaker bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, and the bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 appear again (the data are not shown). This result indicates that the surface species correlated to the bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1 are unstable, which might be decomposed to metallic cobalt and polymeric carbon easily. The observations that cobalt carbides are unstable are in agreement with the results from the literature [9,10]. 3.4 XRD patterns of the oxidized, reduced and used cobalt samples Bulk cobalt phases of the samples were determined by XRD measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 10 . The pattern of the oxidized cobalt sample has peaks at 31.3, 36.9, 44.7, 55.9, 59.3 and 65.4°, all of which are characteristics of Co3O4 phase. The pattern of the catalyst sample reduced with hydrogen at 300°C for 6h has dominant peaks at 41.7, 44.6, 47.5 and 75.9°, which correspond to Co0 phase. The pattern of the reduced cobalt catalyst after use for FT synthesis at 1.0MPa, 250°C for 6h shows same peaks as that of the freshly reduced sample. XRD pattern of the freshly reduced sample reveals the formation of metallic cobalt species, which is in agreement with the results from high-pressure syngas adsorption. Syngas adsorption on the cobalt samples after use for FT synthesis at 1.2MPa and 240°C for 6h indicates that noticeable amounts of cobalt carbides are formed; however, XRD pattern of the sample after use for FT synthesis at 1.2MPa and 250°C for 6h shows that only metallic cobalt is present. These results indicate that only those cobalt species on the surface are transformed during the reaction. The observations that only metallic cobalt species are detected by XRD analysis are consistent with those in the literature [6–8]. Although bulk cobalt phase remains as metallic cobalt during the FT synthesis, the particles on the surface are gradually changed; the formation of cobalt carbides may have great effects on FT synthesis, which should be investigated in the future work. 4 Summary High-pressure syngas adsorption on freshly reduced cobalt sample gives rise to two weak bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1, which are assigned to linear adsorption of CO on metallic cobalt particles. The bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 sharply increase by heating the sample up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow after syngas adsorption for above 1h. The increase of the bands during the heating may be attributed to recombination of the dissociated CO on the catalyst. High ability of the sample for CO dissociation indicates that fine metallic cobalt particles have been formed on the surface. The results of high-pressure syngas adsorption on the reduced sample after use for high-pressure FT synthesis from syngas indicate that fine metallic cobalt particles on the surface are gradually transformed to a mixture of cobalt carbides, sintered metallic cobalt and small amount of cobalt oxides. All the bands due to CO adsorption on the used sample do not increase by heating the sample to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow, indicating low ability of the sample for CO dissociation. Therefore, the particles transformed from fine metallic particles during the FT synthesis are large ones.

        "dc:description": "Syngas adsorptions at 1.2MPa and room temperature on a precipitated cobalt catalyst reduced by H2 and on that used for high-pressure FT synthesis were studied by diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. The syngas adsorption on the freshly reduced sample gives rise to two weak bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1, which are assigned to linear adsorption of CO on metallic cobalt particles. The bands at 2013 and 2033cm−1 sharply increase by heating the sample after performing syngas adsorption for over 1h, up to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow. However, the intensities of the bands begin to reduce once the temperature remained constant. The increase of the bands during the heating may be attributed to recombination of the dissociated CO on the catalyst. High ability of the sample for CO dissociation indicates that fine metallic cobalt particles have been formed on the surface. Syngas adsorption on the sample after use for FT synthesis gives rise to two strong bands at 1999 and 2021cm−1, and several weak bands at 2150, 2025, 1897 and 1822cm−1. These bands do not increase while heating the sample to 100°C in the high-pressure syngas flow, indicating low ability of the sample for CO dissociation; so large particles have been formed on the surface. The bands at 1999, 2021 and 1897cm−1 are assigned to CO adsorption on cobalt carbides; the bands at 2025 and 1822cm−1 may be associated with sintered metallic cobalt species and the band at 2150cm−1 due to Co2+ species. The features of the high-pressure syngas adsorption indicate that, during FT synthesis, fine metallic cobalt particles on the surface are gradually transformed to a mixture of cobalt carbides, sintered metallic cobalt and small amount of cobalt oxides.",
