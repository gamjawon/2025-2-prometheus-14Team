Tel.: +81 29 859 2590; fax: +81 29 859 2501. Graphical abstract Honeycomb catalysts were assembled, using only 30μm-thick Ni foils, to develop genuine monolithic catalysts for hydrogen production via methane steam reforming. A high cell density (900 cpsi) and geometric surface area (59.4cm2/cm3) were achieved on the honeycomb catalyst. The catalyst exhibited high CH4 conversion (over 97%) at 1073K for a long period of up to 8321.1h under low steam-to-carbon ratio (1.34) and space velocity (335h−1) conditions. A H2 production rate of 74.2ml/min was achieved, and carbon deposition was hardly detected in spite of the low steam-to-carbon ratio. The catalyst was gradually deactivated due to the oxidation of Ni, but was repeatedly regenerated by reduction in flowing hydrogen. These findings proved the high potential of the Ni honeycomb catalyst for application to a small-scale hydrogen production system. Monitoring the temperature profile along the axial direction showed good heat transfer between the catalyst and the surrounding gas, which was attributed to the high thermal conductivity of Ni and to the high cell density of the catalyst. The high geometric surface area and good heat transfer are considered responsible for the good performance of the catalyst. Keywords Hydrogen production Metallic honeycomb catalyst Cell density Geometric surface area Temperature profile 1 Introduction Efficient, low-cost, and small-scale hydrogen production is essential for the widespread use of automobile and household fuel cells [1–3]. High-performance catalysts are constantly required for hydrogen production. Honeycomb catalysts, which consist of narrow, straight, parallel channels separated by thin walls, are highly promising compared with conventional pelleted catalysts. The greater potential of honeycomb catalysts is ascribed to the low pressure drop in the channels, because of the laminar reactant gas flow [4], and to the high heat transfer rate in the channels because of the high geometric surface area [4–9]. Honeycomb catalysts have been developed mainly for cleaning automotive exhaust gases. In the meantime, attempts have been made for applications to other chemical processes [10], such as oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins, partial oxidation of methane and higher hydrocarbons to synthesis gas, and steam reforming of n-hexane to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. These pioneering works have demonstrated the high potential of honeycomb catalysts for chemical processes other than exhaust gas cleaning. However, despite their unique characteristics the use of honeycomb catalysts is still very limited, and further studies are required in terms of a wide range of fundamental and technological aspects. Honeycomb catalysts are classified into two types depending on the substrate substance. Metallic honeycomb catalysts have advantages of high thermal conductivity and geometric surface area compared with ceramic honeycomb catalysts, leading to high heat and mass transfer rates [9]. In view of these advantages, in this study we have directed our efforts towards the application of metallic honeycomb catalysts in hydrogen production via methane steam reforming, which has rarely been investigated. Metallic honeycomb catalysts have mostly been made from the foils of heat-resistant ferritic steel, Fecralloy [9]. Fecralloy foils are not catalytically active but can be used as a structural substrate for supporting catalytically active species. A thin porous γ-alumina layer is wash-coated on the foil surface in order to ensure a high surface area, and active species, commonly noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh, are then dispersed on the γ-alumina layer; that is, metallic honeycomb catalysts are designed based on the concept that structural and catalytic functions are separated from each other [9]. Therefore, they are referred to as incorporated monolithic catalysts [4]. Although this fabrication technique has been well established, there still remain some issues to be addressed. First, the use of noble metals inevitably leads to high costs. Second, the wash-coating and dispersing processes usually followed by calcination also lead to increased costs. Third, the dispersed active species and the porous γ-alumina layer cause a concern of potential break away from the substrate, which can lower the catalyst's durability. The challenge in this study is to develop honeycomb catalysts using only pure Ni foils, and without using noble metals and porous γ-alumina, i.e., we aim to develop genuine monolithic catalysts, which are different from the incorporated monolithic catalysts. Specifically, in our design, pure Ni foils accomplish both structural and catalytic functions. Ni is a heat-resistant structural metal, but the concern is whether the catalytic activity of pure Ni foils is sufficiently high. To date, Ni foils are known to have a level of catalytic activity adequate for methane steam reforming. Indeed, the reaction kinetics for methane steam reforming [11,12] and carbon dioxide reforming [13] have been studied using Ni foils. However, the level of the catalytic activity remains unknown. Because of the lack of noble metals and low surface area, technologically attractive activity was hardly expected for bulk Ni foils. We suggest that this issue can be overcome by increasing the cell density of the honeycomb. On the other hand, compared with other honeycomb substrate materials, pure Ni has the advantage of high thermal conductivity: at room temperature, the thermal conductivity of Ni is 90.7W/mK [14], which is much higher than that of Fecralloy (16W/mK) [15] and Cordierite (0.3–5W/mK) [16,17]. This advantage could promote the catalytic performance of Ni honeycomb catalysts. In this study, high cell density honeycomb catalysts were assembled using only pure Ni foils, and the catalytic properties for methane steam reforming were examined over a long period of time (8000h). A few studies related to genuine monolithic catalysts have been reported previously. Fichtner et al. developed a microstructured honeycomb catalyst made from only rhodium foils [18], thus achieving a high catalytic performance for the partial oxidation of methane due to the high thermal conductivity of rhodium; however, a noble metal was employed. We have previously disclosed that heat-resistant Ni3Al intermetallic compound foils show high catalytic activity for methanol decomposition [19,20]. This activity was attributed to the spontaneous formation of fine Ni particles on the surface during the reaction, i.e., the Ni3Al foils served as precursors of the active species. 2 Experimental 2.1 Ni foils Flat pure Ni foils with 30μm thickness were used for assembling honeycomb catalysts. The foils were fabricated by cold rolling of commercially available pure Ni ingots. Table 1 lists the concentration of impurity elements, the texture, and the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface area of the foils that could affect their catalytic properties. The concentrations of carbon and other elements were analyzed by infrared absorption method of combustion gas and inductively coupled plasma method, respectively. The texture was measured on the foil surface by the X-ray Schultz back reflection method. The BET specific surface area of the foils was measured by krypton adsorption using a surface area analyzer (Micrometrics model ASAP 2020). 2.2 Assembling Ni honeycomb catalysts The Ni foils (10×265×0.03mm) were tightly corrugated in a sinusoidal wave form (0.8mm in height and 2mm in spacing), and they were spirally wound with flat foils (10×330×0.03mm) to assemble the honeycomb structure with straight parallel cells (10mm in length). The Ni honeycomb is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Neither porous γ-alumina nor noble metals were coated on the surface. Table 2 lists the geometry of the corrugated foils, of the flat foils, and of the assembled honeycomb. Five pieces of the honeycomb were vertically stacked to form the honeycomb catalyst. The specifications of the five-stack honeycomb catalyst are also listed in Table 2. 2.3 Catalytic reaction Methane steam reforming was carried out over the five-stack honeycomb catalyst in quartz reaction tubes in a flow reactor. A mixture of reactant gases was introduced from the top of the honeycomb catalyst. The honeycombs were numbered from the top (HC-1 to HC-5) and the temperatures of each honeycomb were monitored in their bottom center using a sheathed Chromel–Alumel (1mm in diameter) thermocouple as schematically shown in Fig. 1b. The gas temperature was maintained constant along the axial direction of flow over 50mm using the same thermocouple positioned at 2.5mm below the center of HC-5. Prior to the reaction, the honeycomb catalyst was reduced at 1073K for 1h by flowing pure hydrogen. Next, hydrogen was switched to feed gas mixtures to start long-term catalytic reaction tests up to 8321.1h at 1073K. In the first 6500h, the reaction tests were performed mainly under conditions of low steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) and space velocity (SV) (Feed-A, Table 3 ). The Reynolds number in the honeycomb channel was calculated to be about 0.1; thus, the flow was in the laminar range. When CH4 conversion decreased to a specific level, Feed-A was switched to pure hydrogen in order to regenerate the catalytic activity. The detailed regeneration conditions are listed in Table 4 . The regeneration treatments, referred to as Reg-1 to Reg-12 in Table 4, were carried out mainly at 1073K and, in the late stage, at 1173K to reduce the oxide layer formed on the catalyst surface. After every regeneration, pure hydrogen was changed back to Feed-A to restart methane steam reforming. In the late stage of the test, after 6500h, additional tests under three feed gas mixtures were performed in order to study the effect of H2 pre-addition to the feed gases, of the S/C ratio, and of the SV on the catalytic properties of the honeycomb catalyst between 6355.5 and 6832.5h. The feed gas mixtures used were referred to as Feed-B, C, and D, and are described in Table 3. The flow in the honeycomb channel under these three feed gases remained in the laminar range. After these additional tests, the feed gas was switched back to Feed-A to restart methane steam reforming. The regeneration treatment (Reg-11 to Reg-12 in Table 4) was also carried out in the late stage of the test. The composition of the outlet gases was measured by a gas chromatograph using three packed columns, Molecular Sieve 5A, Molecular Sieve 13X, and Porapak Q, and a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC20B): Molecular Sieve 5A was used for the separation of H2, Molecular Sieve 13X was used for the separation of O2, N2, CH4, and CO, and Porapak Q was used for the separation of CO2. The possible range for quantification was 0.1–70% for H2, 0.1–80% for N2, 0.1–20% for O2, 0.1–80% CH4, 0.1–25% for CO, and 0.1–25% for CO2. After the measurement, H2O in the outlet gas was condensed in a cold trap, and the flow rate of the remaining outlet gases was measured using a flow meter (MesaLabs Definer 220M). These measurements were carried out every 3h. The production rates of gaseous species i, Ri , were calculated as follows: R i = C i F total where Ci is the volume fraction of gaseous species i in the outlet gases and F total is the total flow rate of the outlet dry gases. The CH4 conversion, X CH 4 , was obtained from the following equation: X CH 4 = C CO + C CO 2 C CH 4 + C CO + C CO 2 × 100 The CO and CO2 selectivities, Si , were calculated as follows: S CO = C CO C CO + C CO 2 × 100 S CO 2 = C CO 2 C CO + C CO 2 × 100 2.4 Characterization after the reaction tests The surface morphology of the honeycomb catalysts was observed by SEM (JEOL JSM-7000F) using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), after the reaction tests. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 1 Assembled honeycomb catalysts Because of its face-centered cubic structure and low concentrations of impurity elements, commercially available pure Ni is ductile. Severe cold working is therefore easy. In fact, at room temperature, the tensile elongation is as large as 40% and the yield stress is as low as 150MPa [21], which promotes the cold working capability as compared to those of Fecralloy. Fecralloy has a body-centered cubic structure and its tensile elongation and yield stress at room temperature are 23% and 500MPa, respectively [15]. Therefore, the formation of a fine-pitch corrugation on the foils as well as heavy cold rolling to thin foils are easily achieved. We assembled the honeycomb structure using corrugated and flat foils (Fig. 1(a)). As listed in Table 2, we were able to tightly pack the foils into a small space in order to achieve a high cell density of 900 cpsi, which led to a high geometrical surface area of 59.4cm2/cm3. These values are higher than those of Fecralloy-based honeycombs currently in use (100–600 cpsi and 17.90–43.30cm2/cm3, respectively) [9]. The obtained geometrical surface area is also larger than that of ceramic honeycombs widely employed nowadays (27.40–49.80cm2/cm3) [22]. 3.2 Catalytic reaction Gaseous products were H2, CO, and CO2 throughout all reaction tests. We therefore analyzed the catalytic reaction based on methane steam reforming and on water gas shift reaction: C H 4 + H 2 O = 3 H 2 + C O Δ H 298 ° = 206 k J / m o l C O + H 2 O = H 2 + C O 2 Δ H 298 ° = − 41 kJ / mol At the outset, we examined the catalytic properties of the Ni honeycomb catalyst under the low S/C ratio and SV conditions of Feed-A, and the effect of the regeneration treatment on the catalytic properties in the first 6000h of the reaction test. Fig. 2 shows the CH4 conversion and the CO and CO2 selectivities as functions of time-on-stream. In the first 1100h, the CH4 conversion showed a high value of 97%, which is close to the equilibrium value. In this period, the CO selectivity showed a high value of about 88% whereas the CO2 selectivity was found to be 12%, indicating that methane steam reforming is the major process, accompanied by water gas shift reaction as a side reaction. The low contribution of water gas shift reaction is reasonable, considering that the S/C ratio is only slightly excess steam condition for stoichiometry of methane steam reforming. The carbon mass balance between inlet and outlet gases was maintained throughout the reaction period of 8321.1h, suggesting that carbon hardly precipitated on the honeycomb catalyst. These findings clearly show the high catalytic performance of the honeycomb catalyst for methane steam reforming under low S/C ratio and SV conditions. The CH4 conversion gradually decreased at reaction times >1100h, because of deactivation, and fell to 91% at time-on-stream of 2460h, whereas the CO and CO2 selectivities remained constant. At that moment, the honeycomb catalyst was subjected to the first regeneration treatment in flowing hydrogen, Reg-1, during which the catalyst was cooled down from 1073K to room temperature and immediately heated up to 1073K again, without holding time. This treatment effectively regenerated the activity, raising the CH4 conversion above 97%. These results confirm that the deactivation was due to the oxidation of Ni and, therefore, when the Ni oxide was reduced by flowing hydrogen, the activity was restored to the initial level. However, presumably, the Ni oxides have not been completely reduced in Reg-1 and soon the CH4 conversion decreased again. Next, the catalyst was subjected to longer regeneration treatments before the CH4 conversion fell below 95%. These are shown by Reg-2 to Reg-10 in Fig. 2. With a repetition of 21h regeneration treatments, the catalyst was able to maintain a high CH4 conversion for a long operation time (6000h). In spite of the deactivation, the CO and CO2 selectivities remained constant throughout the test with exception of unexpected fluctuations between 800h and 2500h. Production rates of product gases, H2, CO, and CO2, at time-on-stream of 5701.7h are listed in Table 5 . Exploiting the obtained hydrogen production rate, a small-scale hydrogen production system can be designed for practical use. We next examined the effect of H2 pre-addition to the feed gases, of S/C ratio, and of SV on the catalytic properties in the late stage of the test (after 6500h). Fig. 3 shows the CH4 conversion and the CO and CO2 selectivities as functions of time-on-stream. Feed-A was switched to Feed-B at time-on-stream of 6352.7h. In Feed-B, H2 was added to the feed gas to suppress Ni oxidation, and the feed rates of CH4 and H2O were increased to reach high SV. When Feed-A was switched to Feed-B, after a temporary increase, the CH4 conversion decreased with time. Presumably, the H2 pre-addition shifted the equilibrium of methane steam reaction and the high SV increased the amount of unreacted CH4, leading to the decrease in CH4 conversion. The CO selectivity slightly decreased during this period because of the higher S/C ratio in Feed-B, whereas the CO2 selectivity slightly increased. When the gas feed was changed back to Feed-A at time-on-stream of 6523.5h, the CH4 conversion returned to the level observed in the previous Feed-A condition, indicating a marginal deactivation in Feed-B. H2 pre-addition seems to suppress Ni oxidation, but this beneficial effect is opposed by the effect on the above mentioned equilibrium shift. Subsequently, at time-on-stream of 6619.5h, Feed-A was switched to Feed-C conditions, in which hydrogen was added to the feed gas and both S/C ratio and SV were increased to values higher than those of Feed-A. CH4 conversion decreased faster in Feed-C than in Feed-B, indicating the difficulty to operate the honeycomb catalyst under high SV and S/C ratio conditions with H2 pre-addition. The decrease in CO selectivity and the increase in CO2 selectivity was faster than in Feed-B. When the pre-addition of hydrogen was interrupted at time-on-stream of 6766.5h, i.e., when Feed-C was switched to Feed-D, the CH4 conversion decreased faster than in Feed-C and did not return to the level observed in the previous Feed-A. Clearly, significant deactivation occurred due to the high S/C ratio. Despite such deactivation, the catalyst was then successfully regenerated by reduction in flowing hydrogen, as shown by Reg-11 and Reg-12 in Fig. 3. This represents a beneficial feature of the catalyst. 3.3 Temperature profile of the Ni honeycomb catalyst Temperature profile of the Ni honeycomb catalyst along the axial direction is informative of the activity distribution in the catalyst and of the heat transfer between the catalyst and the surrounding gas. Fig. 4 shows the measured temperature of each honeycomb as functions of time-on-stream in the first 4000h of the reaction test. Immediately after the inflow of reactant gases, the temperature of all the honeycombs dropped sharply below the gas temperature (1073K), mainly because of the heat absorption by the endothermic methane steam reforming reaction. After 10h, the temperature reached a stable state. We hereafter refer to the temperature at time-on-stream of 12.5h as the starting temperature of the methane steam reforming process. Among the five honeycombs, the most upstream, HC-1, showed the lowest starting temperature (1053K), which is 20K below the gas temperature, and was followed by, in order, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, and HC-5. This order of starting temperatures indicates that methane steam reforming occurred most intensely on the most upstream HC-1 and diminished at downstream location. The honeycomb temperature changed with the progress of the reaction, which is closely related to the progress of deactivation, as described below. On the most upstream honeycomb, HC-1, the temperature increased roughly monotonously with time-on-stream, indicating that the endothermic methane steam reforming gradually diminished with time because of the deactivation of HC-1. In contrast to HC-1, for all the other downstream honeycombs, the temperature change with time-on-stream produces a convex downward curve. On the second upstream, HC-2, at first the temperature decreased in opposition to the temperature increase of HC-1, showing a minimum point after 716.9h. The minimum point of HC-2 represents the lowest temperature among the five honeycombs at that time, indicating that HC-2 played a major role in the catalytic steam reforming process in place of HC-1. Next, the temperature constantly increased with time-on-stream due to deactivation, similarly to HC-1, resulting in the formation of a convex downward curve. The third and fourth upstream, HC-3 and HC-4, showed similar behavior: after an initial temperature drop, their temperature decreased to a minimum point and then increased because of deactivation. Their minimum values also represented the lowest temperatures among the five honeycombs at that specific time, during which they adopted a major role in methane steam reforming. In the case of HC-5, a minimum point and the following temperature increase were not observed. Presumably, if the catalyst was not subjected to the regeneration treatment, the expected trend would appear at later time. Thus, clearly, deactivation started at the upstream and prevailed to downstream with time-on-stream, causing the shift of the active sites on the catalyst from upstream to downstream. The effect of the regeneration treatment, described in Section 3.2, was observed on the temperature profile: the honeycomb temperature returned to the initial starting point after the regeneration treatment, as shown in Fig. 4. The recovery temperature of each honeycomb varied depending on the extent of the regeneration. The change in the axial temperature profile is illustrated in Fig. 5 , where the axial temperatures at the starting time and the minimum points of Fig. 4 are plotted. The axial distance was calculated from the top position of HC-1. As described above, the change in the axial temperature profile caught our interest, but more noteworthy is the ability of the catalyst to maintain a high temperature, close to the surrounding gas temperature, throughout the reaction test. Despite the large endothermic heat of methane steam reforming, the temperature difference between the catalyst and the surrounding gas was found to be limited (20K maximum). As a result, gentle temperature gradient developed along the axial direction of the catalyst. Apparently, the honeycomb catalyst was operated under nearly isothermal condition [23]. 3.4 Observation of the honeycomb surface after the reaction Upon completion of the reaction test, the surface of the honeycomb catalyst was examined by SEM. Fig. 6 shows the surface of the most upstream honeycomb HC-1 that was exposed to Feed-A for 408h at 1073K after the final regeneration treatment, Reg-12 (Fig. 3). Neither fibrous nor filmy products were observed on the surface, indicating that, albeit the low S/C ratio of 1.34, carbon hardly precipitated during the reaction. In addition, no fine Ni particles, which could enhance the activity, were formed on the surface, unlike in the case of Ni3Al foils during methanol decomposition [19,20]. Faint crystal facets, presumably due to thermal effects rather than to reaction products with the feed gases, are observed on the grain interior surface. With the exception of these facets, the surface remained flat after the tests. EDS analysis revealed that the grain interior surface was slightly enriched in oxygen, as listed in Table 6 , suggesting a slight oxidation of the surface to form a thin Ni-oxide layer responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. In Fig. 6, observable surface products are the precipitates in the grain boundaries. EDS analysis showed that these products consist of Ni-oxides containing Mn and Si. Presumably, the oxygen originated from H2O in the feed gas diffused into the foil preferentially along the grain boundaries, whereas impurity elements Mn and Si were segregated at the grain boundaries. These three elements reacted with the major constituent Ni to form (Ni, Mn, Si)-oxides. However, because of their small area fraction (<5%), the (Ni, Mn, Si)-oxides could hardly affect both the catalytic properties and the regeneration behavior. In terms of mechanical properties, the Ni honeycomb catalyst remained ductile even after the long tests, indicating that, remarkably, the (Ni, Mn, Si)-oxides did not cause any significant mechanical problem. The other honeycombs, HC-2 to HC-5 set in the downstream position showed a surface similar to that of HC-1. Hence, it is concluded that no fine structure that could enhance the catalytic properties was formed on the surface during the reaction. 3.5 Performance of the Ni honeycomb catalyst The pure Ni honeycomb catalyst exhibited good catalytic properties for methane steam reforming over a long period under Feed-A conditions (S/C=1.34 and SV=335h−1), as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The CH4 conversion remained high during the reaction and carbon precipitation was significantly suppressed, albeit the low S/C ratio. The honeycomb catalyst was gradually deactivated due to oxidation, but repeatedly regenerated in flowing hydrogen by ready reduction of the surface oxide. The obtained hydrogen production rate (Table 5) was sufficient to design a small-scale hydrogen production system for practical use. As listed in Table 1, there is no obvious cause in the Ni foil properties that leads to the good catalytic performance of the Ni honeycomb catalyst. Noble metals, namely Pt, Pd, Rh, R, and Ir, which are known to be catalytically active, showed low concentrations (<0.05wt%). Mn impurity showed the highest concentration, yet lower than 0.1wt%. Other elements were also found in low concentrations. As previously reported [24], a strong cube (001) <100> texture was generated on the foils. The cube texture implies that the foil surface is predominantly terminated with (001) plane which is the secondary closed-packed plane after (111) plane in face-centered cubic metals. Since high atomic density planes are known to be unreactive compared with low atomic density planes [25,26], the present foil surface is considered to be terminated by a relatively unreactive plane. The measured BET surface area was so low that the ratio between the BET surface area and the geometrical surface area was found to be equal to 1, indicating that no micro-porous structure was present on the surface. Two factors can be attributed to the good catalytic performance of the Ni honeycomb catalyst. One is the high geometric surface area, as listed in Table 2. Good ductility of Ni foils allowed the assembly of a thin wall high cell density honeycomb. This yielded a high geometric surface area, which provided a large number of active sites for chemical dissociation of CH4, leading to high catalytic activity. The other factor is that throughout the reaction test the catalyst was operated at high temperatures, close to the gas temperature, as shown in Fig. 5. This suggests that a sufficient amount of heat was transferred from the surrounding gas to the catalyst which was subjected to cooling by the endothermic methane steam reforming process; thus, the catalyst was kept at high temperatures. Consequently, the methane steam reforming reaction proceeded efficiently, resulting in high CH4 conversion. This favorable heat transfer is due to the high thermal conductivity of the honeycomb catalyst, which is attributed to the following two factors: (1) the very high thermal conductivity of Ni (90.7W/mK at room temperature), and (2) the high cell density (900 cpsi). The beneficial effect of highly conductive metallic honeycomb catalyst has been previously reported by Tronconi and his group for exothermic catalytic reactions [5–8]. Adoption of highly thermal-conductive metals in metallic honeycomb catalysts proved to effectively enhance the heat transfer properties in exothermic reactions, leading to improved catalytic properties. Based on this understanding, the present findings for endothermic reactions can be explained. In addition to the above-mentioned catalytic performance, the advantages of the Ni honeycomb catalyst can be listed as follows: (1) the only component material is Ni, with no noble metals required; (2) the fabrication process, including corrugation and winding, is simple; (3) regeneration of the catalyst is easy and repeatable. 4 Conclusion Honeycomb catalysts were assembled using only 30μm-thick pure Ni foils, and the catalytic properties for methane steam reforming were examined at 1073K for a period up to 8321.1h. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: (1) High cell density (900 cpsi) and high geometric surface area (59.4cm2/cm3) were achieved on the Ni honeycomb catalyst. This supposedly contributes to the good performance of the catalyst. (2) The honeycomb catalyst exhibited high CH4 conversion (>97%) under Feed-A (S/C=1.34 and SV=335h−1) conditions. H2 production rate of 74.2ml/min was obtained and carbon deposition was hardly detected. These findings proved the high potential of the catalyst for application to a small-scale hydrogen production system for practical use. (3) The honeycomb catalyst was gradually deactivated due to Ni oxidation, but was repeatedly regenerated in flowing hydrogen. As a result, the catalyst exhibited a good performance throughout the reaction test. (4) Temperature profile along the axial direction showed a good heat transfer between the catalyst and the surrounding gas, which was attributed to the high thermal conductivity of Ni and to the high cell density of the catalyst. The good heat transfer is also considered to contribute to the good performance of the catalyst.

The catalyst was gradually deactivated due to the oxidation of Ni, but was repeatedly regenerated by reduction in flowing hydrogen. These findings proved the high potential of the Ni honeycomb catalyst for application to a small-scale hydrogen production system. Monitoring the temperature profile along the axial direction showed good heat transfer between the catalyst and the surrounding gas, which was attributed to the high thermal conductivity of Ni and to the high cell density of the catalyst. The high geometric surface area and good heat transfer are considered responsible for the good performance of the catalyst.",
