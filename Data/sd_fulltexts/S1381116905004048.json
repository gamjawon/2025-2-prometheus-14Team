Graphical abstract Diels–Alder cycloaddition has been studied using amorphous silica and different ITQ-2 and MCM-41 pure silica and metal containing materials as catalysts. The introduction of transition metal atoms in the framework increases the reaction rate preserving the selectivity to the endo–endo isomer. The presence of acidic OH groups provoke the retro-Diels–Alder reaction increasing the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer. Diels–Alder cycloaddition between cyclopentadiene and p-benzoquinone has been studied using amorphous silica and different ITQ-2 and MCM-41 pure silica and metal containing materials as catalysts. The reaction can afford different products depending on the molecular reacting site, and the possibility of consecutive additions. Structured solid catalysts increase the selectivity to the endo–endo isomer. Silanol groups have not enough Brönsted acidity to interact with the carbonyl groups present in the dienophile, to reduce LUMO's energy and provide a better overlap between HOMO and LUMO, according to the frontier molecular orbital theory. The introduction of transition metal atoms in the framework increases the reaction rate for the Diels–Alder reaction while preserving the selectivity to the endo–endo isomer. The presence of more acidic OH groups enhance the retro-Diels–Alder reaction increasing the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer. Keywords Diels–Alder reaction ITQ-2 MCM-41 Amorphous silica Brönsted acid 1 Introduction The Diels–Alder is an orbital-controlled pericyclic reaction, which is generally carried out with an electron-rich 1,3-diene and an electron-deficient dienofile. Different procedures have been described to increase the reaction rate of Diels–Alder reaction (DAR), and involve the use of homogeneous Lewis acids [1], heterogeneous acids [2], high pressures [3] and water as a solvent [4]. Microporous and mesoporous molecular sieves can strongly enhance the rate of bimolecular reactions by combining the spatial confinement of the reactants which decrease the reaction frequency factor, and the presence of catalytic active sites which decrease the activation energy [5,6]. Moreover, when these materials are used as catalysts, their pore dimensions and topology can also influence product selectivity. It is then not surprising that molecular sieves have been used as catalysts for Diels–Alder reactions [7–14]. However, in many cases the activity of microporous molecular sieves for DAR can be strongly limited by the diffusion of reactants, and products. In this work, we have made use of a delaminated zeolitic materials (ITQ-2) that combine high external surface with the presence of “cup like” cavities open to the exterior [15], as well as mesoporous molecular sieves to carry out DAR between cyclopentadiene, and p-benzoquinone which can generate several reaction products with different shapes and sizes. The reaction has been performed with the pure silica materials, in order to see the effect of the adsorption-concentration on reaction rate, as well as with the same materials containing Lewis or Brönsted acid sites. The results are compared with those obtained under homogeneous conditions by thermal activation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Aerosil was supplied by Degussa. ITQ-2 zeolites [pure silica ITQ-2, ITQ-2 (Ti) and ITQ-2 (Al)] were prepared and characterized according to the procedures described in the literature [16,17]. MCM-41 catalysts [pure silica MCM-41 of 40 and 24Å, MCM-41 (Sn), MCM-41 (Ti) and MCM-41 (Al)] were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized according to the procedures in the literature [18–21], using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as a template, aerosil as silica source and TiO4, SnCl4 or Al2O3 as sources of heteroatoms. 2.2 Catalytic tests After being activated under vacuum at 250°C, 250mg of the corresponding calcined material was introduced in a two necked bottom flask under N2. Immediately after, 108mg of p-benzoquinone (1.0mmol) and 10.0mL of CDCl3 were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for a few minutes and 0.2mL of freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (3.0mmol) was added via syringe. Then, it was heated at 60°C and samples were taken every hour, being directly analysed by 1H NMR. Reaction products were isolated by HPLC using mixtures H2O:MeOH:MeCN (45:50:5). Identification of these products was carried out by NMR techniques (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HETCOR and NOE) being spectral data fully coincident with literature [22]. Conversion values for endo–endo and endo–exo products are always referred to conversion to the endo adduct. 3 Results and discussion In Fig. 1 , the yields to the different products at different levels of conversion are given. The shape of the curves indicates that the primary DAR gives the endo isomer that very rapidly reacts with a second molecule of cyclopentadiene to give especially the endo–endo isomer. Under our reaction conditions, we have not detected the exo isomer neither the secondary exo–endo and exo–exo products. From these results, the reaction network given in Scheme 1 can be written. It should be remarked that even though the exo DA isomer is more stable than the kinetically controlled endo, the second was the only one formed, and no any other product was detected by 1H NMR. 3.1 Influence of catalyst adsorption/confinement As we have seen the DAR between cyclopentadiene and p-benzoquinone can take place thermally without requiring a catalyst. However, the rate of the reaction could be increased by introducing a high surface area solid which may increase the rate of the reaction by concentrating the reactants on the surface. This effect should be enhanced if the solid has pores and cavities that can confine the reactants and further decrease the entropy of the activated complex, while influencing product selectivity. In order to check that, we have selected three materials: (a) Silica aerosil, which has 200m2 g−1, all corresponding to external surface area and with no confinement effect. (b) A mesoporous molecular sieve of the MCM-41 type with two different pore diameters. (c) A delaminated zeolited material with well structured high external surface area formed by “cup like” cavities of ∼0.7nm×0.8nm. The textural characteristics of these materials are given in Table 1 . Reactivity results after 2 and 3h reaction time are given in Table 2 . The results clearly show that the presence of silica does not increase conversion, 1 1 Conversion values are referred to the second addition of cyclopentadiene, taking as a starting material the endo product. neither has any effect on selectivity conversion is referred here to the second addition of cyclopentadiene, talking as starting material the endo product. On the other hand both pure silica MCM-41 samples increase conversion. Nevertheless, it appears that ITQ-2 gives a higher selectivity to the endo–exo isomer than MCM-41 or silica. This effect can be due to the presence of the “cups like” cavities at the external isomers. At this point, there is another factor, which has to be considered when discussing the observed conversion increase with ITQ-2 and MCM-41, and this is the presence of a large number of silanol groups on these materials. Indeed, the Si–OH can act as weak Brönsted acid sites which could interact with the carbonyl groups present in p-benzoquinone, reducing the energy of the LUMO and providing a better overlap between HOMO of cyclopentadiene and the LUMO of the benzoquinone. In order to check that possibility IR spectra of aerosil, MCM-41 and ITQ-2 in the 3600–3800cm−1 region have been recorded, after activation in vacuum at 400°C, 10−4 Torr during 10h (Fig. 2 ). The results given in Fig. 2 show that the intensity of the ∼3745cm−1 band associated to silanol groups follows the order ITQ-2>MCM-41 (40Å)>MCM-41 (24Å)≫Aerosil. From those results and those given in Table 2, we cannot find a direct correlation between the normalized intensity of the silanol groups absorbing at 3745cm−1, and the catalytic activity, indicating that the main catalytic effect of the pure silica solids should be related with a concentration and confinement effect on the surface of the structured catalysts. Catalyst recycling was studied with pure silica MCM-41 (40Å). Results in Fig. 3 show that some deactivation occurs after repeated recycling. It is worth noting that while conversion decreases, no changes in selectivity were observed. 3.2 Introduction of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites in the solids The presence of homogeneous Lewis acids has been shown to catalyze the DAR [1], by modifying the energy levels of the reagents, usually the dienophile, by complexation with the carbonyl group. Thus, we have prepared Ti–ITQ-2 [23], and Ti [21] and Sn [20] MCM-41. The results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 clearly show the catalytic effect of Ti and Sn, which by being tetrahedrally coordinated in those materials [24] act as Lewis acid sites for the DAR. While the above results look quite straight forward, an interesting observation can be made from the kinetic curves (see Figs. 4 and 5) at long reaction times. It can be seen there that the selectivity to the endo–endo and endo–exo decreases and increases, respectively, when the reaction is prolonged for longer times, being this effect more notorious with Sn–MCM-41 than with Ti–MCM-41. This effect can be explained by considering that the retro-Diels–Alder reaction (retro-DAR) occurs with Ti–MCM-41 and, especially, with Sn–MCM-41. The retro-Diels–Alder is a competitive reaction of DAR, and from the point of view of the frontier molecular orbital theory, they both assemble. Thus, the retro-DAR is affected by the same reaction and catalyst variables than DAR. However, Wijnen and Engberts [4b] have shown that H2O, can promote the retro-DAR with respect to DAR by acting as a hydrogen-bond-donating agent. Taking this into account we speculate that the hydroxyl group in Sn–OH by having a higher positive density on the hydrogen than in Ti–OH or Si–OH, should promote better the retro-DAR. This effect is represented in Fig. 6 . As it can be seen there, initially the endo monoaduct isomer formed in the first DAR reacts with a second cyclopentadiene molecule to provide the endo–endo isomer (1). This process occurs very fast, even thermally, giving a high yield of the endo–endo and a low yield of the endo–exo isomer. However, when the more acidic Sn–OH group is present, the above step is “reversible” (2) due to the retro-DAR, and consequently the monoaduct is regenerated. Then, even if the formation of the endo–exo requires a higher activation energy, the endo–exo product is more stable than the endo–endo, and consequently the retro-DAR of the endo–exo is much slower. This phenomena will result in a selectivity increase of the endo–exo isomer with reaction time. If all the above is true, we should expect that by increasing further the positive density of charge on the hydrogens in OH groups, i.e. increasing the Brönsted acidity, the rate of the retro-DAR should increase, increasing therefore the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer. As it is well known, stronger Brönsted acid sites can be generated in silicates by introducing aluminium in framework positions. When this was done in ITQ-2 and MCM-41, the results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 show that the Al containing samples not only strongly increase conversion, but the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer is much enhanced with reaction time, in agreement with an improvement on the rate of the retro-DAR. 4 Conclusions We have shown that while aerosil does not have any effect on the DAR between cyclopentadiene and p-benzoquinone, a pure silica delaminated zeolitic ITQ-2 and structured mesoporous MCM-41 materials strongly increase the reaction rate due to an adsorption-confinement effect of the reactants. Silanol groups appear to play a minor, if any, catalytic role. It is noticeable that by decreasing the pore diameter of the MCM-41 an increase in conversion occurs, which should be due to a further molecular confinement. Tetrahedrally coordinated Ti and Sn catalyze the DAR, strongly increasing the reaction rate. The presence of Ti and more so Sn, catalyze the retro-DAR resulting in an increase of the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer with time. This effect is related with the presence of more acidic Sn–OH groups. Indeed, when stronger Brönsted acid sites were generated by introducing framework Al, the retro-DAR was much faster and the selectivity to the endo–exo isomer increased by a factor of four. Highly accessible delaminated zeolitic and mesoporous molecular sieve materials with either Brönsted or Lewis acid sites are excellent catalysts for DAR.
