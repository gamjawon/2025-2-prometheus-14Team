Stytsenko Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, Russian Academy of Science, 117912, Moscow, Russia Received 6 September 1993; revised 13 September 1994; accepted 5 January 1995 Abstract The basic principles of the preparation of surface modified catalysts, the problems of characteri- zation of the metals, and models describing their active surface are considered. The characteristics of surface transformations and the distribution of modifying elements are defined by the ratio of reactiv- ity/diffusivity under the conditions of the surface modification. The state of the metals (Ni, Pd, Cr, Si, Sn) is characterized by using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, laser microprobe analysis, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, M6ssbauer spectroscopy as well as magnetization and chemisorption. The high activity, selectivity, and tolerance to common poisons are demonstrated for catalysts based on supported nickel and palladium in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

Introduction Bimetallic catalysts are at present the subject of considerable interest in metal catalysis, due to the fact that their properties are superior to those of monometallic catalysts. Of the various methods known for preparation of bimetallics, the reactions of organoelemental compounds (OEC) as well as metal carbonyls appear to be a very promising to modify the surface of metals [ 1 ]. The application of OEC to prepare bimetallics was considered for the first time in refs. [2,3]. So far mainly compounds of Groups IV and VIII metals have been used as modifiers of active metals of Group VIII. In this regard, works reported in refs. [4-12] should be mentioned. Somewhat later, compounds of Group VI metals were used for this purpose as well, and the systems Pd-Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Rh, or Ru [ 13], Pd-Cr [ 14- 17], Ni-Cr [ 15,16] were obtained and characterized. 0926-860X/95/$29.001995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDIO926-860X(95)O00 12-7 2 V.D. So,tsenko/Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 1 26 It should be emphasized that for many cases the surface modification of metals (M) by OEC did not lead to an improvement of their selectivity and stability to poisons. This was caused mainly by the lack of knowledge on the relationships of transformations of OEC during their decomposition on the metal surface. In earlier studies the main task was considered to be how to find the conditions of controlled decomposition of OEC without significant interaction of modifying elements (E) with supports [7,8,10,18,19]. The E/M ratio was discussed as a general factor affecting the properties of bimetallics. It is clear at present that other factors such as the nature of the modifying compounds [ 10,11 ] and their ligands are of great importance as well. It has been established recently that the presence of some ligands, which are bonded to the modifying elements, improves the properties of bimetallic catalysts [ 20,21 ]. Yet, further studies are desirable to elucidate the nature of OEC transformations on metal surfaces, the distribution of modifying elements in the surface layers, the formation of new phases such as MEx etc. [ 11 ]. The aim of this publication is to give an overview of our work, which has been carried out at the Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis and published mainly in Russian journals. The article is devoted to surface modified bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. 2. Basic principles of metal surface modification Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons are of great importance for petrochemical and chemical industries. The conventional catalysts for these processes (supported Group VIII metals) have a high activity but their selectivity and stability are, in many cases, insufficient for industrial purposes. Usually this is caused by side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and cracking of hydrocarbons, accompanied by coke deposition on the catalyst surface. These side reactions are known to be 'structurally sensitive' [22]. In contrast, the desired reactions, such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are considered to be 'structurally insensitive'. So it may be suggested that the side and desired reactions of hydrocarbons proceed on different sites on a catalyst surface. If this assumption is correct then it is possible to improve the catalyst selectivity by a partial transformation of those sites of the surface, which include structurally imper- fect centres. The latter are known to be active centres of topochemical reactions [23,24]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to perform such a partial transformation of the catalyst surface by means of topochemistry. We have developed a specific modification method rendering partial transfor- mation of the catalyst's surface [4-6]. It consists of two steps. The first is a preparation of supported zerovalent Group VIII metal (M) catalysts. The second step includes hydrogenolysis of organoelement compounds over the prepared cat- alysts: V.D. Stytsenko / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 1-26 3 X ELm + H2 + M/Support ~ (ME~Ln + MEy) /Support (I) where M=Ni or Pd; E=Cr, Ge, Si, or Sn; L=CO, C1, alkyl, or aryl; 0<y< 1, 0<n<m. The intermediate products of OEC hydrogenolysis react with the active metal M, and eventually new species with intermetallic bonds are formed such as MEy and MEyLn. The systems including these species are referred to as surface modified bimetallics (SMB) [ 16]. Now let us consider the nature of possible transformations of the surface, during its modification by OEC, and the distribution of modifying elements. It should be noted that so far the first one has never received any attention and the second one has been examined within the scope of the segregation problem of bimetallics. The widely used models of the segregation of metals are based on thermodynamic properties: heats of sublimation [25], size differences [26], and phase diagram [27]. It seems strange that kinetic properties of bimetallic systems have been ignored when the segregation process is considered. It may be proposed, by analogy with ref. [28], that the nature of surface trans- formations will depend on the dimensionless ratio r/j between the specific reactivity (r) of an organoelemental compound and the diffusivity (j) of the element, which formed during OEC decomposition on the surface of the active metal M. Thus, the values r andj ( mol / m2 s) are referred to the interface OEC / M, where reaction (I) proceeds. (a) When the reactivity of OEC is much greater than the diffusivity of E both on the surface (Js) and in the bulk of metal M (jv), the formation of intermetallides MEy is facilitated in the vicinity of defects on the surface and the distribution of the element will be localized around the defects. (b) In the case of roughly equal reactivity and surface diffusivity (r-~js) of the element, the latter may form a thin layer (per se or as an intermetallide) on the active metal surface. (c) When the bulk diffusion of element E cannot be neglected (r =jv), then the new solid phase is formed at small conversions of the surface monolayer and it grows into the bulk of the active metal [ 29]. Element E will be distributed mainly over the whole bulk of the metal while islands of phases E or MEy may be formed on the surface. (d) In case r<j~, the new solid phase is not formed initially and element E is distributed uniformly over the bulk of the active metal. Fig. 1 shows the relevant structure types (a)-(d) of bimetallics, which may be prepared by reaction (I) by the complete elimination of ligands L. Based upon such a phenomenological description we may formulate the requi- rements for the nature of element E and appropriate conditions of OEC decompo- sition, which provide SMB with the required properties [ 30]. First of all metal M should accelerate the decomposition of OEC. It can be expected that the rate of interaction between the active metal M and the modifying 4 V.D.

The latter is realized in systems which readily form solid solutions or intermetallides MEy. As to diffusivity of element E in a metal matrix, it may be controlled by the size factor and electronegativity difference effects, which are known as the Hume- Rothery rule [ 31 ]. 100*Rate (mmoi/min) 4r\" 3 I 1 0 20 40 100 120 140 160 Time (min) Fig. 2.

V.D. S~tsenko / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 1-26 5 In a number of cases the modifying element has a high affinity to oxygen and its reduction from the oxide form is difficult or not feasable (e.g., for E-A1, Si, Ti, Cr, W, Mn, etc.). Considering that in this case oxidized forms of element E can be formed as a result of the interaction with the oxidic support [2,32], all operations with OEC should be performed in a protective atmosphere. To summarize the abovementioned, it may be concluded that in the preparation of catalysts, based on the modification of Group VIII metals, decomposition of organic compounds of elements should be considered, and the proper modifying element should have moderate bond energies with carbon and oxygen. To provide strong evidence in favour of our kinetic concept of the surface modification, we performed a set of experiments in some bimetallic systems of given composition and particle size, but prepared by using various methods, rea- gents and initial states of surface. 3. Catalyst preparation and characterization 3.1. Catalyst preparation Nickel-tin and nickel-silicon catalysts were prepared on the basis of a commer- cial nickel-kieselguhr catalyst containing 56% Ni (SBET = 110 mZ/g). The latter was subjected to standard treatment including calcination for 7 h in air at 400. This initial state of the catalyst is denoted as the oxidized form (A). The reduced catalyst (B) was prepared by treatment of A in hydrogen according to a temperature program: holding at 300 for 1 h, heating to 400 for 0.5 h, holding at 400 for 2 h. After this treatment nickel is totally reduced ( > 99%) which is confirmed by temperature-programmed reduction data. The oxidized and reduced forms of supported nickel were impregnated by a solution of a tin or silicon compound: A in air and B in hydrogen atmosphere. Tin- containing compounds used included SnC12\"2H20, SnCla'5H20, tetrabutyltin (SnBu4), and tetraphenyltin (SnPh4), all of 'pure' grade. Silicon-containing cat- alysts were obtained with use of tetraphenyl- or tetrabutylsilicon. The solvents used were ethyl alcohol for inorganic tin compounds and n-hexane or benzene for organotin or organosilicon compounds. Only the freshly reduced catalysts were contacted with organoelement compounds, otherwise the latter would be oxidized by hydroxyl groups on the surface. Such a procedure enabled us to obtain various samples, which properties will be characterized in Section 4, below. The impregnation was performed in the following manner. A measured volume of solution containing a calculated quantity of tin compounds was added to about the same volume of catalyst having a particle size of 1-2 mm. After standing for 20 h the solvent was evaporated, the catalyst was dried at 70-80, and calcined 3 h at 400 in helium for samples based on B or in air for samples based on A. 6 V.D.

Products: CO (1, 2) and CH4 (3). Nickel-chromium and palladium-containing catalysts were prepared on the basis of y-alumina supplied by SKTB (Novosibirsk, Russia). This support had a surface area of 210 mZ/g and a pore volume of 0.6 ml/g. The precursor NiO/AIzO3 was prepared by the standard impregnation method [33] and calcination for 6 h at 450 in helium flow. The reduction of this precursor was carried out at 400 for 2 h and at 500 for 4 h in hydrogen flow. Palladium-containing precursor was prepared by an impregnation of freshly calcined alumina with a solution of palla- dium dichloride in aqueous ammonia for 15 h. After evaporation of solvent and drying for 2 h at 70-90 this precursor was reduced for 4 h at 120-150. The surface modification of nickel and palladium-containing precursors in oxi- dized (A) or reduced (B) forms by organochromium and/or organosilicon com- pounds was performed as mentioned above in the case of the Ni-Sn system. Where hexacarbonylchromium was used for modification of the catalysts the preparation was carried out by sublimation in vacuo or in helium flow. Finally, all the modified catalysts were reduced in hydrogen flow at 400 (Ni- Sn, Si) or 500 (Ni-Cr, Pd-Cr, Si). The decomposition of organoelemental compounds was monitored by chroma- tography and mass spectrometry, by analysis of C1 for the chlorides, as well as by M6ssbauer spectroscopy for tin. The typical examples of preparation of Ni-Sn and Ni-Cr catalysts are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The quantity of the elements contained in the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy after mineralization of the samples. All percentages are indicated as weight percentages. 3.2. Catalyst characterization The specific surface of metals (S) was determined by chemisorption of oxygen at 20 by a pulse method (0.02 cm3 Oz/pulse) after the reduction in hydrogen V.D. Stytsenko /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 1-26 7 and purging with helium. After such treatment the state of the metals corresponded to MH, confirmed by the evolution of hydrogen under thermodesorption of reduced catalysts and by the evolution of water under heating of the catalysts after chemi- sorption of oxygen. Both hydrogen and water were detected and measured by mass spectrometry. Based on these data, the stoichiometry O2/M will be 3/4 according to equation 4MH + 302 ~ 4MO + 2H20 To calculate the values of SM (m2/g), the following formulae were used: SNi -- 5.33 .104 A and Spa = 6.67\" l04 A, where A (mol/g) is the value of oxygen chemisorption per gram of catalyst. The static magnetization was measured by the Faraday method with use of a Setaram vacuum balance in fields from 10 to 15 000 Oe at 20, taking into account a correction for diamagnetism of the ampoule and support. For magnetization measurements a sample of the catalyst (30 rag) was placed in a quartz ampoule, reduced under standard conditions, evacuated for 1 h at 400 to 10 4 Pa, and then the ampoule was sealed. The mean radius of the spherical nickel crystallites, calculated from the mag- netization values at low fields, was about 8 nm, and consistent with that (6-7 nm) calculated from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained on a DRON-3 diffracto- meter. The saturation magnetization of the catalysts were determined after calci- nation in the ampoule (vacuum, 800, 15 h) and slow cooling to 20. M6ssbauer spectra of reduced and passivated (by 0.2% Oz in N2) samples were recorded at - 170 and 27 in an electrodynamic type apparatus with a L19SnO2 source. The spectra were treated by a standard program based on the assumption of a Lorentzian line shape. The isomeric shifts were calculated relative to tin dioxide. Laser micromass (LAMMA) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (ESCA) of reduced catalysts were obtained on LAMMA 1000 and Escalab-5 instruments, respectively. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ni and Ni-Cr/ A1203 catalysts were recorded at room temperature on a synchrotron electron beam (2 GeV) at both nickel and chromium K-edges. The measurements were made in fluorescence mode with a resolving power of about 1 eV. The reduced samples were transferred in vacuo to the chamber closed with beryllium windows. The interatomic distances were calculate by using Fourier transformation within an accuracy of about _+ 0.004 nm. The catalytic activities of the freshly reduced catalysts were determined in a flow type set-up at pressures of 0.1-1.0 MPa in the temperature range 90-500. The feed containing a vapour of reactants was supplied onto the top of the catalyst bed. The conversions and reaction rates were calculated on the basis of product concen- trations that were determined by on-line gas chromatography (GC). All the exper- iments were performed in the kinetically controlled range. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of butadiene-1,3 and isoprene was performed at temperatures of 20-50 in a glass set-up (P--0.1 MPa) or in a stirred autoclave (P = 2.0 MPa). 8 V.D.

Nickel-tin system To exclude any ambiguity due to different compositions and crystallite sizes, we have prepared 7 samples of catalysts having the same composition (56% Ni and 5% Sn) but starting from the two initial states of nickel/kieselguhr catalyst (oxi- dized and reduced) and from various tin compounds. All measurements were performed after reduction of the catalysts in hydrogen under standard conditions. It should be noted that the mean nickel crystallite size of reduced catalysts (6-7 nm) did not change after modification as shown by XRD and magnetization data. The same behaviour was observed for Ni-Cr and Pd-Cr systems, and the results agreed with the available data for other systems such as Pd-Ge, Sn, Sb, or Pb [ 12], Pd-Cr [ 17], and Ru-Si, Ge, Sn, Sb, or Pb [34]. Thus, it is an intrinsic feature of surface modified catalysts. The results of catalyst characterization are presented in Table 1. The reaction products of tin-containing compounds and nickel/kieselguhr catalyst are detected by M6ssbauer spectroscopy (Fig. 4). These data show that in all the catalysts investigated tin oxides and metallic tin are almost absent. The spectra comprise a doublet with an isomeric shift (IS) of 1.4-1.6, characteristic of intermetallides with a ratio Ni/Sn < 3.0 [ 11,35,36]. In sample 5, which was obtained by a treatment of the reduced catalyst with SnC12, the intermetallide is absent even after heating at 800. The value of the isomeric shift (IS=0.3) corresponds to the compound SnC14\" 5H20 (product of SnCI2 oxidation). The formation of a nickel-fin intermetallide phase, which is paramagnetic [ 37 ], in samples 2-4, 6, 7 is confirmed also by the decrease in their magnetization. A comparison of magnetization for Ni and Ni-Sn catalysts has shown that after treatment at 400 a part of the nickel, from 2.5% (samples 2, 3) to 7.7% ( samples V.D.

This decrease of magnetization is not caused by the presence of coke, which, by contrast, increases the catalyst magnetization significantly (sample 1' ). To reveal the dislocation of the intermetallide on nickel crystallites we have measured the oxygen chemisorption by samples and calculated SNi values, because it is known that chemisorption is suppressed by the intermetallide formation [38]. The data of Table 1 show that the decrease of SNi values (from 42 to 14 m2/g) is correlated with that of magnetization, with the exceptions of samples 2 and 3. Actually after the treatment of B samples with organotin compounds, the content of nickel in the intermetallide phase, as determined by the decrease in magnetization of Ni/SiO2 (Table 1 ), does not exceed 4%, i.e., adds up to 40% of surface nickel atoms in Ni/SiO2 catalyst. However, the values of SN~ for samples 2 and 3 are almost the same as those before the modification ( sample 1 ). Taking into account the absence of oxide forms of tin (Fig. 4), one may conclude that the decomposition of organotin compounds proceeds only on the metal surface of reduced nickel catalysts, and the intermetallide product covers only a negligible part of this surface. Therefore, in accordance with the prediction, the decomposition of SnR4 on the reduced nickel catalyst is featured by the local deposition of tin, in the vicinity of strongly imperfect sites of the metal surface. As the diffusivity [ 39] and solubility [40] of tin in the fcc nickel lattice are negligible, the intermetallide phase will grow as stacks over the imperfect sites due to diffusion of nickel into the zone of tin precipitation (Fig. 1, a). It is obvious that other possible distributions of interme- tallide phase in the samples 2 and 3 would significantly change their magnetization and oxygen chemisorption which conflicts with experimental data. In contrast, in the case of modification of nickel oxide by tin chlorides it is possible for tin ions to diffuse into the oxide lattice during high-temperature cal- cination. Intermetallide may be formed only after reduction of nickel and tin oxides. Such systems, which correspond to conventional Ni-Sn catalysts [38,41], are featured by an uniform distribution of tin on the surface and in the bulk due to a 10 V,D.

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis of samples 6 and 7 confirmed this distribution of tin: Sn/Ni ratio was constant within the depth range of 4-10 nm. 4.2. Nickel-chromium and palladium-chromium (silicon) systems To demonstrate that the presence of Group VIII metals is a necessary condition for providing zerovalent bimetallics, Cr-Si/AI203 and Pd-Cr-Si/A1203 samples were characterized by SIMS and ESCA. Fig. 5 (a, b) shows SIMS spectra of these samples prepared by decomposition of organochromium and organosilicon com- pounds on AlzO3 (a) or Pd/AI203 (b), respectively. A comparison of the spectra is focused on peaks of Si, Cr, and Pd. When palladium is absent (Fig. 5a), silicon is present as SiO (4), while chromium is detected mainly as CrO (6), Cr20 (7), and Cr202 (8) species. With palladium (Fig. 5b), on the contrary, silicon is present as Si (9) and chromium is detected as Cr (5) and CrO species, both Cr20 and Cr202 species being absent. We may conclude, therefore, that palladium protects both Si and Cr on the surface against oxidation. ESCA data (Figs. 6 and 7) confirm also the presence of zerovalent chromium (Eb 572 eV) and silicon (Eb 99 eV). The interaction of zerovalent elements (Pd, Cr, Si) with the formation of alloys or intermetallides will change the properties of palladium. Actually, the binding energies of Pd 3d increase by 1-1.5 eV due to silicon (Fig. 8), but the energies in Pd-Cr bimetallics remain unchanged. This different behaviour may be explained by the presence of an intermetallide for Pd-Si [42], and its absence in the Pd-Cr system [40]. The catalytic properties of this system will be considered below. In the case of the nickel-chromium system, where an intermetallide is formed neither, XRD, ESCA, and EXAFS did not indicate any change in the state of nickel. As to the chromium state, the observations were inconsistent. ESCA indicated the presence about 20% zerovalent chromium. In contrast, Cr K-edge EXAFS spectra in Fig. 9 indicated only chromium oxide in two Ni-Cr samples, prepared by decom- position of hexacarbonylchromium (a) or diarenechromium (b) on the Ni/Al203. To elucidate peculiarities of the chromium distribution on nickel and palladium surfaces, the magnetization and chemisorption of oxygen were measured for alu- mina-supported samples, including mono- and bimetallics. It should be stressed that for Cr/A1203 neither magnetization nor chemisorption of oxygen were observed. Chemisorption data, presented in Table 2, indicate that the addition of Cr to Pd/ A1203 does not change oxygen chemisorption on the palladium, unless the Cr/Pd ratio exceeds ca. 9. In case of Ni/AI203 the addition of chromium (Cr/Ni = 0.1 ) decreases sharply the number of nickel atoms exposed to oxygen. It may be pro- posed that after modification chromium is localized mainly on the surface of nickel crystallites rather than in the bulk due to the low diffusivity of chromium in the nickel lattice [39]. In the case of the Pd-Cr system where the diffusivity of V.D.

The specific distribution of chromium provides unusual magnetic properties to the Ni-Cr system. The data of measurements (Fig. 10) show that the addition of 12 V.D.

ESCA spectrum (Cr 2p) of catalyst Pd-Cr/AI203. chromium results in a great increase of magnetization, which conflicts with the data reported for conventional Ni-Cr alloys [37]. Such a behaviour was predicted, however, for low-dimensional Cr [43] and Cr-Fe [44] systems. The study of the valence electronic features of chromium confirmed the existence of a ferromagnetic chromium monolayer [45 ]. All these results provide evidence for the model (b) of Fig. 1 where the surface layer of low-valence chromium ions and Crare located on nickel crystallite, like in the cherry model [46]. We may conclude, therefore, that the distribution of elements in the surface modified bimetallics is governed by the kinetic factor r/j rather than by thermo- dynamic ones.

It should be stressed that these models can be realized only in cases where both reagents (M and E) are in the zerovalent form. Where an active metal M is in an oxide form, then oxidation of E is possible during the modification. This process is irreversible when the electronegativity of E is higher than that of M (e.g., for E=Cr and M=Ni). It is obvious that such a condition is unfavourable for the formation of intermetallic bonds M-E. We cannot expect, therefore, the improve- ment of a catalyst after the modification of its oxide form by organoelement com- pounds. 5. Catalytic properties of SMB: the prediction and experiment Now we discuss the catalytic properties of the above mentioned bimetallics and their accordance with the theoretical models (a)-(d). It should first be noted that all the supported modifying elements, i.e. Sn, Si, and Cr, were inactive in oxygen chemisorption as well as in catalysis. Let us consider first the properties of nickel-containing catalysts, whose surface is modified by tetraalkyl compounds of Group IVB elements [4-6]. It is known that the strength of the element-carbon bond in the compounds decreases in the sequence of C-Si > C-Ge > C-Sn whereas the reactivity r will increase in the sequence: rs~ < r6e < rs,1 [47]. On the other hand, the diffusivity of silicon in the nickel lattice is 106 times as great as that of tin [ 39,48]. In other words, the ratio r/j will be maximal for tin, minimal for silicon, and intermediate for germanium. Thus, it may be predicted that in the sequence under consideration the catalyst Ni- Sn will be much better than Ni-Si. V.D.

Dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activity of silica supported Ni, Ni-Si, and Ni-Sn catalysts Analysis of characterization results of Ni-Sn catalysts shows that the extent of interaction of the reduced precursor B with tin compounds decreases in the series: SnR4 > SnC14 >> SnC12. Based on the concept discussed so far, one may expect the greatest improvement of the catalytic properties will be achieved for nickel surface modified with organotin compounds. The results of dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane (Fig. 11 and 12, Table 3) support the prediction. Modification of Ni/SiO2 by tetrabutyl- or tetraphenyltin increases significantly the catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene (Table 3). The benzene yield increases up to 98%. In contrast, Ni/SiO2 modified Table 3 Catalytic properties of (56% Ni-5% Sn)/SiO2 samples in dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane.

For notations see Table 3. by tetraphenylsilicon does not change its activity and selectivity for the ratios of Si/Ni from 0.05 to 0.3. Similar properties of bimetallics were found for Ru-E and Ni-E, where E=Si, Ge or Sn in case of hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis [34] and cyclohexane dehydrogenation [49]. It is evident from Fig. 11 (curves 1, 5) that cyclohexane hydrogenolysis over the unmodified Ni/SiO2 (1) and slightly modified (5) catalysts proceeds non- stationary with a spontaneous rise in temperature of catalyst (surface ignition) [50]. This phenomenon is observed when the rate of a heat evolution (due to exothermal hydrogenolysis) exceeds the rate of a heat elimination (due to dehy- drogenation and heat exchange). Therefore, the surface ignition is the direct evi- dence of a low catalyst selectivity in respect to dehydrogenation. In this case, the relative selectivity of catalysts (C6H6/CH4 ratio) does not exceed 9.1 as Table 3 shows. Hydrogenolysis is suppressed most greatly and the ignition is not observed for the catalysts containing intermetallide (Fig. 1 l, curves 2-4, 6, 7). The catalysts activity in cyclohexane hydrogenolysis varies by a factor of a thousand and decreases in the sequence: Ni/SiO2(B) > B+SnCI2 > B+SnC14 > B+SnR4 > NiO/SiO2(A) + SnC14 > A + SnC12. A similar order was found for the catalytic activity in ethane and n-hexane hydrogenolysis [51 ]. The cyclohexane dehydrogenation activity is suppressed to a lesser extent (Fig. 12). Samples 2 and 3 modified by organotin compounds show the same activities as the original sample 1 up to cyclohexane conversions of about 65%. As a result the relative selectivity of the modified catalysts increases by 4-60 times (Table 3). The observed differences in catalytic activity are not related to the influence of chlorine traces remaining in the catalysts (catalysts impregnated with 1-3% NiCI2 have about the same activity as that of sample 1 ) or to changes in SNi. The latter varies by a factor of 3.5 (48-14 mZ/g) while the hydrogenolysis activity is decreased by 3-5 orders of magnitude. All the changes of the catalyst properties V.D.

Nickel-tin intermetallide formation and its site directed location are, there- fore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the activity and selectivity improve- ment of nickel catalysts in dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons. Another example of the superiority of the surface modified Ni-Sn catalyst over the conventional one [38] is dehydrogenation of cyclohexanediol-l,2 to pyrocat- echol [4-6]. Fig. 13 shows that the surface modification of nickel increases the pyrocatechol yield by 30% due to a suppression of hydrogenolysis and, moreover, increases ( > 100 h) the catalyst life time. It should be mentioned that both the commercial Ni/SiO~ and conventional Ni-Sn catalysts are deactivated rapidly due to an oxidation of the catalyst by the reaction mixture [52]. We may conclude that the properties of SMB agree with the predictions. A Ni- Sn catalyst is much better than Ni-Si for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The most favourable location of tin is site directed, by which it is possible to suppress hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis without affecting the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst. 5.2. Hydro-dehydrogenative properties of alumina supported Ni, Ni-Cr, Pd, Pd- Cr, and Pd-Cr-Si catalysts One may expect some decrease in dehydrogenation activity of Ni-Cr catalysts when chromium covers most of the nickel surface. The experimental results show that this is the case for cyclohexane dehydrogenation at 270 and P = 0.1 MPa: 18 V.D. Stytsenko /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 1-26 Catalyst composition 10% Ni/A1203 I- I + 3% (I) + l%Cr Cr Activity (mmol/kg s) 1.9 1.1 0.7 There are two possible explanations for this result: ( 1 ) shielding of nickel by chromium (as in case of nickel modified by tin chlorides) or (2) the formation of new active centres, which are intrinsically less active than those in Ni/A1203. To differentiate between these possibilities, Ni-Cr catalyst has been tested in other reactions, namely benzene hydrogenation and toluene hydrodemethylation. Tables 4 and 5 show the results obtained. It is obvious from Table 4 that after surface modification of nickel-containing catalysts with chromium their bulk hydrogenation activity increases up to twice its Table 4 Benzene hydrogenation activity of Ni/AI203 and Ni-Cr/AI203 catalysts; T- 97, P = 0.1 MPa Metalloading (%) Activity (mol/kg h) TOP' 10 2(s ~) 16 Ni 8.5 0.60 4 Ni 5.6 1.83 16 Ni+ 1.3 Cr 17.3 8.74 4 Ni+0.4 Cr 3.2 7.11 4 Ni+2.1 Cr 7.1 39.4 4 Ni +7.4 Cr 0.4 3.2 a Calculated on the basis of chemisorption data (Table 2) assuming 1.5- 10~ Ni atoms per 1 m2.

If the decrease of the active surface SNi after modification is considered, the specific activity (r/SNi) has increased more than tenfold. The main factor of toluene hydrodemethylation is the selectivity [ 53 ]. It is known that the selectivity of conventional nickel-containing catalysts is poor due to inten- sive cracking of the arene ring [54]. Data presented in Table 5 show that modifi- cation of nickel by chromium provides a great improvement of the selectivity. It should be stressed that catalysts obtained by modification of nickel oxide with complexes of zerovalent chromium were very unstable and deactivated rapidly in accordance with our prediction. A comparison of the Ni-Cr catalyst with the best Rh-containing ones [55,56] shows the superiority of the former (Table 6). It operates at lower temperature and pressure and provides the same yield of benzene. The main advantage of nickel- chromium SMB over rhodium catalysts is its high tolerance to poisoning by water and sulphur-containing impurities. We may conclude now that the modification of the nickel surface by organoch- romium compounds results in the formation of new centres rather than in shielding the nickel surface. These new centres have an increased activity, selectivity and stability in hydrotreating of aromatic hydrocarbons as compared to those in the original catalyst, Ni / AI203. In the case of palladium containing SMB, we may expect on the ground of ESCA analysis that the chemical properties of the Pd-Cr system will be close to those of the original palladium, but the properties of the silicon-containing system will be different. The study of the catalytic properties of these systems in alkadiene hydro- genation and alkene aromatization confirms the predictions. The modification of the palladium surface by chromium results in some decrease of the activity in hydrogenation of butadiene-l,3 and isoprene, e.g., at 24 and PH = 66 kPa: from 0.6 (Pd) to 0.53 s l (Pd-Cr). However, the selectivity of Pd- Cr is higher than that of palladium due to suppression of further hydrogenation of the desired alkenes. The following results are typical for butadiene-1,3 hydrogen- ation over Bayer's 0.6% Pd/A1203 and 0.5% Pd-Cr/A1203 catalysts at 30 and PH = 1 MPa: 20 V.D.

Another characteristic of the Pd-Cr catalyst is the high sulphur tolerance. Fig. 14 shows the decrease of the hydrogenation rate (R) of butadiene-l,3 due to the presence of 1% H2S (R~) in hydrogen. It is clear that the conventional Pd/A1203 (Bayer) and Pd-Cr(3 + )/A1203 [57 ] catalysts are poisoned rapidly by H2S. The activity of surface-modified Pd-Cr catalyst is decreased only slightly. Its life time is about 50 times longer than that of Pd/A1203 and equals > 1000 h when the sulphur content does not exceed 50 ppm. Due to the higher sulphur tolerance and selectivity, palladium-chromium SMB is very prospective for hydrotreating of commercial olefinic cuts of C4-C5 [58]. The results of aromatization of C6-C8 alkenes are presented in Table 7. The conversions of hexene-1 over Pd and Pd-Cr catalysts are similar: 55.1 and 58.5% respectively. The distribution of products is also the same: benzene is the dominant product. The only difference is higher stability of Pd-Cr to sintering and to deac- tivation by coke [59]. Since palladium and Pd-Si catalysts were not stable to coking, we investigated aromatization by Pd-Cr-Si system. The data of Table 7 show that silicon-containing catalyst provides the product of a different composition as compared with all conventional catalysts including Rs/R 0,8 4i \\ \\ I 0 5 10 15 tool H2S/mol Pd Fig. 14.

It is not the case for silicon- containing catalysts where the major products are xylenes from hexene-1. The investigation of this phenomenon showed that xylene precursors are alkadienes (C8), which may be formed by alkylation of the initial alkene [59]. Fig. 15 shows the results of hexene-1 aromatization over three catalysts. The comparison of curves 1 and 3 proves that palladium modified by chromium and silicon increases the steady-state yield of AH from 8 to 55%. Moreover, the Pd- Cr-Si catalyst is the best in regard of a resistance to coking [61 ]\" its deactivation by coke is much slower as compared to commercial Pt-Ir-Cr catalyst [62]. Our catalyst also showed a good performance in aromatization of a low-grade gasoline with high content of unsaturated hydrocarbons (ca. 47%) and sulphur (ca.

The contents of unsaturated and sulphur in the upgraded gasoline were decreased to ca. 30% and 0.16%, respectively, and that of AH increased from 10.6 to 22%. It is noteworthy that the catalyst provides a stable conversion of unsaturated hydrocarbons to arenes for 120 h. Therefore, Pd-Cr-Si catalyst is promising for aromatic hydrocarbon production from low-grade, unsaturated gasolines (e.g., obtained from Pyrolysis or Visbreak- ing processes). 5.3. Ligand effect for surface modified catalysts and their outlook Surface modified bimetallics include species of two types, i.e. MEy (bimetallics per se) and MEyLn, as indicated above. In line with the composition, their properties may be controlled within the scope of the solid-phase subsystem (e.g., by the E/ M ratio) as well as by variation of the ligand subsystem (L/M ratio). The first technique is a conventional one for heterogeneous catalysts while the latter is an approach typical for homogeneous catalysts. In other words, SMB involve the properties which are characteristic of both known types of catalysts. Let us consider now the ligand (i.e. groups L of the modifying organoelement compound ELm) effect on the properties of SMB catalysts. This effect is widely known for homogeneous catalysts but for heterogeneous ones this matter has not previously received any attention. The first direct observation of the dependence of catalytic properties on the number of ligands remaining on the catalyst was made for propene disproportionation and hydrogenation over Mo (CO) x [ 63,64 ]. The influence of this factor may be revealed only at low temperatures where the initial number of ligands does not change during catalysis. So far only few examples of this kind are known: propene conversion [ 63,64 ], hydrogenation of geraniol [ 21 ] and isoprene. Table 8 summarizes these data which show that it is possible to control the catalyst's activity and selectivity and even to change the reaction path varying the number of ligands remaining on the catalyst.

The variation of the nature of ligands bonded to the modifying element provides another tool for controlling the activity of catalysts. Table 9 shows that the extent of this effect may be as large as 102 in the case of cyclohexane hydrogenolysis suppression. By a proper choice of the ligand it is possible to improve greatly the activity and selectivity of catalysts as in the case of cyclohexane dehydrogenation and toluene hydrodemethylation. The nature of the effects mentioned above is not ascertained completely and further investigations are needed. It is obvious, however, that the surface modified bimetallics are very promising as versatile systems for the development of catalysts with the desired properties. 6. Conclusions The history of a modern type of bimetallics -- surface modified bimetallic catalysts -- is considered from the general concept, through the preparation method (including hydrogenolysis of organoelement compounds on the metal surface), to their applicability. The combination of various methods of physico-chemical char- acterization (ESCA, LAMMA, EXAFS, M0ssbauer spectroscopy, etc.) has shown that the modifying element in SMB is mainly in the zero-valent state. With the specific examples of real catalysts it is shown that the distribution of elements in the SMB is defined by the kinetic factor (reactivity of OEC/element diffusivity). The requirements for the nature of the element and appropriate conditions of OEC decomposition are described which provide SMB with the required properties. 24 V.D. So'tsenko /Applied Catalvsi,s /1: General 126 (1995) 1 26 The tests of SMB prepared (Ni-Sn,~i-Cr, Pd-Cr, Pd-Cr-Si) have demonstrated their advantages as compared with known catalysts for various hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. In the case of the Ni-Cr and Pd-Cr-Si systems, new active sites are created with improved activity, selectivity, and stability to poisons. The ligand effect for SMB is discussed and good prospects for this new class of catalysts are predicted.

Stytsenko Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, Russian Academy of Science, 117912, Moscow, Russia The basic principles of the preparation of surface modified catalysts, the problems of characterization of the metals, and models describing their active surface are considered. The characteristics of surface transformations and the distribution of modifying elements are defined by the ratio of reactivity/diffusivity under the conditions of the surface modification. The state of the metals (Ni, Pd, Cr, Si, Sn) is characterized by using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, laser microprobe analysis, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as magnetization and chemisorption. The high activity, selectivity, and tolerance to common poisons are demonstrated for catalysts based on supported nickel and palladium in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.
