BARRAULT#. C. FORQUY+ Laboratoire de Catalyse Organique, Uniuersite de Poitiers. F 86022 Poitiers Cedes (France) and V_ PERRICHON Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, F 69626 Villeurbanne Cedes (France) Summary Some iron-alumina catalysts exhibit significant selectivity in FischerTropsch synthesis towards low molecular weight hydrocarbons, methane and light olefins. We have investigated the mode of formation of these hydrocarbons. Reactions on fresh or on carbon-predeposited catalysts and _CO adsorption--thermodesorotion experiments showed that CO dissociative adsorption is an essential step in hydrocarbon synthesis. Experiments with ethylene added O (CO f H2j reagents showd that the olefin significantly enhanced both the formation of methane and CYC4 hydrocarbons, and the hydrogenation to ethane. These results suggest the possibility of chain growth via a carbene-olefin mechanism. Introduction Recently it has been demonstrated that CO and Hz adsorption and CO hydrogenation activity/selectivity properties of metals are significantly influenced by metal-tic particle size and strong metal-support effects [1 - 81 . We have also observed the same phenomena with iron catalysts regarding support effect [gJ . Moreover, we have been able to show that there is a qualitative relationship between the activity of the catalyst and the dissociative adsorption of CO [g] . Thus dissociation appears to be an essential step -in hydrocarbon synthesis which could occur via oxygen-free species CH, Recent results obtained from the fields of surface science, organometallic chemistry and catalysis strongly support this hypothesis. Bell [101 surveys the work leading up to this view of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. In the present .paper we report results obtained with some of the catalysts referred to in our earlier study [91 and which were chosen among *Author to whom corresoondeace should be addressed.

We have endeavoured to determine how hydrocarbons form in studying (i) the relation between the activity and CO adsorption; (ii) the reactivity of a precarbided iron-alumina catalyst and (iii) the transformation of primary products such as ethylene. Experimental Catnlysts iron catalysts were prepared by slowly adding ammonium hydroxide to an alumina-ferric nitrate suspension [9] . Activation of the catalysts was carried out by reduction at atmospheric pressure under a flow of hydrogen at 823 K_ Reaction Procedure Tile reaction (CO + Hz) was performed under pressure in a fixed-bed reactor. The experimental conditions and analytical procedures have been described in a previous paper [9] _ Magnetic and adsorption measurements were performed in a Faraday microbalance; a double bucket system permitted simultaneous measurements of mass change and magnetic forces [9, 11] . Nomenclature The catalytic activity is defined by the total transformation rate (TTR) which represents the percentage of carbon monoxide molecules transformed to carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons: TTR (%) = 100 Fcot - Fcoo F'co i where F col and Fcoo are respectively the inlet and the outlet molar flow rates of CO. The selectivity for the hydrocarbon C is expressed either by: Scn (90) _ 100 Fq., X n Fcol - Fcoo which represents the ratio of the moles of CO transformed into the hydrocarbon C to the total number of moles of CO transformed, or by: Rcn (ss'o) = 100 Sc 100 nsco which represents the hydrocarbon selectivity without taking into account C02 formation. The relative importance of C02 is then expressed by the relation: 100 COz 100 Sco. COz ~ HZO 100 - Sco, 1_ 9 7 Results COcterization of catalysts The results of the magnetic and chemisorption measurements or. fresh catalysts are surnnarized _n Table 1. Precursors and reduction process Magnetic measurements on the precursors at 294 K show them to be paramagnetic, behaving as FeOOH oxyhydroxide with a small content of a ferromagnetic component, probably ^Y-Fe203. After inital hydroxide decompositioi we observed an intermediate reduction step which corresponds to ferromagnetic Fe30a_ The reduction into metallic iron begins at or around 670 K. The degrees o reduction given in 'fable 1 are calculated from saturation magnetization values at 294 K. Degrees found lay between 30% and 90%; they are low for catalysts weak in iron, from which one can assume the formation of an aluminate which does not reduce easily. Catalyst areas The metallic area is determined according to tyro methods. First, the measurement of the magnetization difference resulting from valency change for the superficial iron after hydrogen activation-thermodesorption cycles [12] allows calculation of the number of iron acorns affected: A.,,. The second, referred to as AGO, is obtained from the irreversible CO adsorption on the sample after evacuating at 294 K under 10-7 torr pressure. The values A.ag and Aco given in Table 1 are low, corresponding to a poor dispersion of the iron, and there is ao agreement between the two series of values. Carbon monoxide thzrmodesorption TPD experiments show the existence of two main adsorption states of CO, and the high temperature one has been attributed to a dissociative adsorption of the carbon monoxide molecule [9] . From such measurements, we car: estimate the relative percentage of dissociated CO and the area of TABLE 1 Characterization of iron-alurnina catalysts Catalyst Calculated A~ag AGO Relative AdissociatedCO (roan degree of (rn2 g I Fe) (rn2 g 1 Fe) percentage of (air g-' Fe) content %) reduction dissociated CO (lro) ( o) L 29 8.8 25.7 8_9 2.3 5 55 5_3 7.1 17.0 1.2 10 77 7.5 7.4 13.5 1.0 20 88 5.8 5.1 12.0 0_6 198 metallic iron able to dissociate CO at 294 K. Values presented in Table I show that a minor amount of CO was adsorbed in the dissociated form and that there is a decrease of Aa;u CC) with increasing iron content. Activity and selectivity in the (CO + Hzl reaction With these iron-alumina catalysts of variable iron content (i - 30 wt.%) we obtained the results presented in -table 2. Activity The specific activity of the catalysts decreases significantly as their iron content increases and stabilises at (Fe) = 10 wt.%. If these activities are expressed in terms of turnover numbers, one observes that activity is proportional to the number of iron sites capable of dissociating CO. Moreover, CO, as well as methane and ce-olefins are primary products of the reaction. Thus the decisive step in the formation of hydrocarbons definitely seems to be the dissociation of CO, as suggested previously [9] . Selectivity The selectivities of the catalysts presented in Table 2 are obtained at isoconversion of CO: TTR CO = 2010. One observes the almost exclusive formation of light hydrocarbons CI-C4 with the exception of catalysts weak in iron. Moreover the C2-C3 or C2-C4 range contains essentially olefins, especially ethylene. This distribution is thus different to that obtained in more classical cases. It also turns out that whereas Schulz-Flory's law predicts a Cz-C4 range of 52.590, we obtain a value of between 55% and 60 0. Although we cannot at present put forward a hypothesis as to the nature of the active sites [ 13] , it seems clear that the activity of the catalyst is determined by the dissociative adsorption of CO, whereas mass and function selectwities depend more on the surface composition of the catalyst. Influence and reactivity of predeposited surface carbon Given the above results, it seemed important to study the (CO f lie) reaction in the presence of a catalyst on which carbon has been predeposited by dismutation of CO. The results in Table 3 show that the activity of the catalyst, is greatly increased by carbon predepositing. Thus it seems that in the presence of the reaction mixture, the surface carbon is transformed into methane as well as C,-Cc hydrocarbons. However, olefin selectivity shows a significant and apparently irreversible drop in the presence of a carbon deposit. We believe that the surface composition of the catalyst, which depends on the competition between bulk carbidization and hydrocarbon synthesis [14] has been modified, bringing about a change in function selectivity. 199 TABLE 2 (CO + HZ) reaction on iron-alumina catalysts Catalvst 1 2.5 5 10 20 30 (iron content wt.%) Activity XXlOZ) 23.4 18.5 13.3 10.2 8.3 6.2 (mot f-s g-1 Fe) T.O.N.* 1.1 1.2 1.1 1.5 (molec. sec -1 site 1) Product dist.

Participation of primary products ire secondary reactions Olefins and in particular ethylene may undergo secondary reactions which can significantly alter the product distribution. Work on these tonics has already been carried out, and shows the principal transformations of olefins during (CO + Ii2) reaction [15 - 19, 23bj . In our investigation, two processes are of particular interest, the first being the initiation of new chains and the second being the incorporation into growing chains. As a result, we carried out the experiments presented in Table 4 and Fig. 1 in the presence of a Fe10-A1203 catalyst- fee have given the transformation rates of the reagents and the formation rates for the products expressed in carbon equivalents h-E. i 200 V_ 10'?n_mole_h'' reaction cO++25 5 4~ 3~ z~ y o- CI r2 -3 C4 C'02 Q paraffins Q olefins traction CP,,* fit Cl C2 C3 C4 V~ 3~ 2~ O~ via, CO+H2+C2H4 C, C3 CQ c02 Fig. 1.

(C2H4 =H2) reaction The ethylene a mainly hydrogenated into ethane, but an appreciable .mount omethane and (C3-C,.) hydrocarbons is also formed. These results emphasize that CH2 or CH fragments we=e formed, and transformed into methane via hydrogenation or into higher hydrocarbons by reaction with ethylene or polymerisation. The Leigh C4-hydrocarbon content also suggests a dimerisation reaction. Influence of added ethylene in a (CO + H2) reaction As previously, the olefin is hydrogenated into ethane but there is also a significant change in product distribution (Fig. i), especially. for C hydrocarbons, and an increase in the transformation rate of CO (Table 4j. 201 TABLE 4 Influence of added ethylene in (CO + Hi) reaction Reaction Added C-ZH.z CO trans- Product CR and feed (re x mot h-1) formed (rt x mot h-E) (x10') composition (x102) (mot) (x107) CHa#C2H4 C2H6 C3H6 C3Eig C4HS C4HLO C02 CO, H2, C2Ha, 19_54 10.2 1.92 11.18 6.86 1.69 0.39 0.66 1.06 4.63 (0-55, 0.38, 0_07) CO.

An examination of the results shows that the introduction of CZH4 leads to similar increases in rates of CO transformation, and CH4 and Cssz formation. Oh the other hand these increases are greater in (C3-C4) hydrocarbon formation and directly involve ethylene. 4 quantitative analysis othese results suggests three possible CZHC transformations: (i) incorporation into the growing chain initiated by the (Css + HZ) reaction; (ii) dimerisation into C4 hydrocarbons; (iii.) ethylene hydrogenolysis and formation of surface carbon species giving methane and higher hydrocarbons. This transformation, analogous to that observed recently by Hugues et aI. [7j could proceed through carbene intermediates in a carbene-olefin mechanism. Conclusions The results obtained with iron-alumina catalysts chosen for their appreciable light- olefin selectivity suggest that the synthesis of hydrocarbons can be described by the reaction network shown in 1< ig. 2: methane and hydrocarbons are formed from oxygen-free species. In the first steps of this mechanism, CO chemisorbs molecularly and then dissociates, to produce atoms of carbon and oxygen. The extent io which these processes arms reversible is not. yet fully established; .however TPD. experiments indicate that the recombination of carbon and oxygen atoms and the desorption of CO are rapid, since scrambling of preadsorbed `2C`60 and `2C`$O is observed [2Of . But a part of the superficial carbon is transformed into inactive carbon or is incorporated into metallic carbides. The oxygen released by Css dissociation is removed from the catalyst either as HZO or CO-2. In the present case, COz is the dominant product- 202 CO ~ C ~ C - O ---~r Parallel Mechanisms /1\\ I Inactive carbon CO-- CO' metallic carbides &.___ C O IL W9S. ill 1 z~ HO Hs CH /1% CZH4 I,Hs C'H4' CI-IZ CZH6 l 1 A C H _ Fe Hs Chain Growth 3 6 C3; C H3 CZJH8 jHs CH Fig- 2. A proposed reaction network for hydrocarbon synthesis from (CO -H2). The synthesis of hydrocarbons is then initiated bar the hydrogenation of carbon atoms forming methyne, methylene and methyl groups. The methyl groups are viewed as precursors to methane formation whereas higher hydrocarbons would be formed through carbene or alkylidene intermediates [21 - 23] resulting either from carbene insertion into the metalalkyl bond (D or from a carbene-olefin mechanism L'0-, [7, 23b] . This interpretation would account for the results obtained from (EC? f H,j reaction and for the influence of ethylene on this reaction, and would also explain non-classical cases of p_ oduct distribution. Further evidence for the role of methylene groups in the chain growth has also been presented by Brady and Petit [24]. The intermediates lead either to olefins via a. fl-hydrogen transfer or to paraffins via a hydrogenation reaction. The present data, which show that under given conditions oxygen-free species such as carbenes are essential in hydrocarbon synthesis, do not of course preclude the possibility of. another reaction path. Future studies will help to achieve a more detailed picture of the reaction . mechanism and to determine the relations between changes in surface species and catalytic properties. 203 Aclozowledgements The authors gratefulIy acknowledge support from the S.N.E.A.

        "dc:description": "Some iron-alumina catalysts exhibit significant selectivity in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis towards low molecular weight hydrocarbons, methane and light olefins. We have investigated the mode of formation of these hydrocarbons. Reactions on fresh or on carbon-predeposited catalysts and CO adsorption-thermodesorption experiments showed that CO dissociative adsorption is an essential step in hydrocarbon synthesis. Experiments with ethylene added to (CO + H2) reagents showd that the olefin significantly enhanced both the formation of methane and C3-C4 hydrocarbons, and the hydrogenation to ethane. These results suggest the possibility of chain growth via a carbene-olefin mechanism.",
