Graphical abstract A stronger Lewis acid-base interaction is constructed between B-C3N4 and aromatic sulfides, which makes the active sites more accessible. Regulation of electronic properties has been found to be an effective strategy to boost catalytic performance. In this paper, boron doped graphene-analogous carbon nitride (B-C3N4) was prepared and applied in aerobic oxidative desulfurization (ODS) as a metal-free catalyst. Detailed characterizations showed that B atoms have been doped into the framework of carbon nitride, which redistributes the electron structures and appears a stronger Lewis acidity. The B-C3N4 exhibited an impressive sulfur removal to aromatic sulfides, especially to 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophaene, and the catalytic ability of different sulfides was 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene > 4-methyldibenzothiophene > dibenzothiophene. A stronger adsorption progress was constructed between Lewis acid B-C3N4 and Lewis basic aromatic sulfides by the Lewis acid-base interaction, which benefits the next oxidation reaction during the ODS process. After recycling 5 times, the sulfur removal of B-C3N4 could still remain higher than 90%. The current method provides a potential application of B-C3N4 for the removal of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene. Keywords Carbon nitride Boron-doped Lewis acid-base interaction Oxidative desulfurization 1 Introduction Motivated by the increasingly serious pollutions by the combustion of sulfides in fuel oil [1,2], the aromatic sulfides, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives (4-methyldibenzothiophene, 4-MDBT; 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene, 4,6-DMDBT), as the main sulfides in the diesel, have attracted more and more attentions. Meanwhile, they have also become a focus of public attention in recent years because of their potential roles of precursors for the formation of S-analogous dioxins [3]. Dioxins are highly toxic and show potential damages or fatal risks to the human and environmental health. Therefore, the production of clean fuel oil in low sulfur concentration has turned out to be an extremely urgent subject. Currently, the most commonly employed desulfurization technology in refineries is hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [4–6]. However, to produce the fuels containing lower sulfur, HDS is still meeting serious challenges, especially the difficulty in removing aromatic sulfides. Therefore, many efforts toward substituted desulfurization technologies have been developed. Among all the newly technologies [7–10], oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is a potential one due to its removal of aromatic sulfides in oils at moderate reaction conditions effectively [11,12]. During the ODS process, aromatic sulfides are oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone. The oxidation products are extremely easy to be separated from fuel oils via extractants or adsorbents due to the stronger polarity [13,14]. For the oxidation of different aromatic sulfides, a concept of electron density has been widely accepted to explain the sulfur removal with 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT > DBT [15]. But many types of research on ODS reported the removal of aromatic sulfides decreases in the order of DBT > 4-MDBT > 4,6-MDBT, which ascribes to the steric-hindrance of substituted methyl groups [16–18]. Therefore, it is difficult to remove 4,6-DMDBT relatively. To realize the production of clean diesel, finding a new catalyst to remove 4,6-DMDBT directly is of vital importance. Graphene-analogous carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a representative two-dimensional (2D) metal-free material [19], has attracted substantial interests as co-catalysts (BiVO4/C3N4@SiO2, CeO2/attapulgite/g-C3N4) or supports (MoO2/g-C3N4, WO3/g-C3N4, HPW/mpg-C3N4) for ODS systems due to its unique physical and chemical features [20–24]. However, rare works employ g-C3N4 as an efficient catalyst in aerobic ODS. The reason is that the pure g-C3N4 hardly shows any satisfying aerobic catalytic performance in ODS systems. Therefore, crafting g-C3N4 catalysts with high activity for desulfurization reaction is still a novel challenge. To boost the catalytic performance of g-C3N4, several strategies have been adopted to tame the electronic structure, including decoration [25], copolymerization [26], making composites [27] and elements doping [28,29]. Generally, elements doping has been considered as an effective strategy to modify the electronic structures [30]. The modification of electronic structures would endow them with unoccupied molecular orbitals, which appears Lewis (L) acidity and conducive to the improvement of catalytic performance. For example, Lan et al. deliberated that P-doped g-C3N4 can enhance its L acidity and improve the enrichment of reaction substrates [31]. Ren et al. presented that L acidity is in favor of the absorption for sulfides [32]. These strategies provide a concentrated microenvironment for the reactions and make active sites more accessible. In the previous reports, some works focused on the basicity of DBT, 4-MDBT, and 4,6-DMDBT [33,34]. All of the results show that these sulfides are the Lewis bases. Thus, a g-C3N4 catalyst with grafted L acidity may construct a concentrated reaction microenvironment via L acid-base interactions between the catalysts and sulfides, which could benefit to the aerobic ODS performance. The purpose of this work is to construct an effective adsorption combined oxidative desulfurization system to improve the sulfur removal performance of g-C3N4 through taming the interfacial electronic properties, which constructs stronger L acid-base interactions between the catalysts and sulfides. The catalysts were prepared by annealing the mixture of urea and deep eutectic solvent (DES). By means of a series of characterizations, it was found the introduction of the B atom evidently enhances the L acidity of g-C3N4. Moreover, the B-C3N4 catalysts with grafted L acidity showed impressive performance to remove 4,6-DMDBT. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials DBT, 4-MDBT, 4,6-DMDBT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. Choline chloride (ChCl), boric acid (H3BO3), urea, and decalin come from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co. Ltd. These reagents we had used are analytical grade and without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts and model oil 2.2.1 Synthesis of DES DES was prepared according to the previous report [35,36]. In a typical process, ChCl and H3BO3 at the molar ratio of 1:2 were heated and stirred at 90 °C for 3 h in a round-bottom flask until a homogeneous liquid (DES) was obtained. Then, the product was cooled to room temperature naturally and used as the boron source of doped carbon nitride materials. 2.2.2 Synthesis of B-C3N4 In this synthetic procedure, a certain amount of DES and urea (10 g) were mixed and grounded to a uniform powder in an agate mortar. Then, the white mixture was transferred into a covered crucible and heated to 550 °C for 4 h from room temperature at a ramping rate of 2 °C/min. Herein, the product was named B-C3N4, which corresponds to the initial molar amount of DES of 0.5 mmol. Similarly, g-C3N4 was prepared without DES in a muffle furnace. 2.2.3 Preparation of model oil Model oils were prepared by dissolving aromatic sulfides (DBT, 4-MDBT, and 4,6-DMDBT) in decalin, respectively. Meanwhile, different sulfur concentration (500 ppm, 350 ppm, 200 ppm) of 4,6-DMDBT were prepared. The tetradecane was added as an internal standard in model oils. 2.3 Catalysts characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement was conducted at 2–15 kV accelerating voltage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out in a Hitachi H-700 transmission electron microscope. N2 adsorption-desorption analysis was performed by a micromeritics 2020 HD88. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) datas were acquired using a Kratos Amicus spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra (FT-IR) were collected on a Nicolet Nexus 470 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a D8 ADVANCE with Cu Kα radiation k = 1.5406 (Å), collected from 10° to 80° (2θ) with a scanning rate of 7°/min. Thermal programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was determined in a fixed-bed continuous flow micro-reactor (Autochem TP5000 apparatus from Micromeritics). Approximately 100 mg catalysts after pressing and grinding were firstly treated at 300 °C for 40 min with He flow. After cooling to room temperature and saturating with NH3 for 40 min, the catalysts were treated by pure He (30 mL/min) at 100 °C for 60 min. Then, the desorption profiles from 100 °C to 500 °C (10 °C/min) were collected by the thermal conductivity detector with He flow. Nicolet 380 spectrometer in situ was operated to record Pyridine adsorption on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Pyridine FT-IR). The samples were treated at 300 °C under vacuum for 45 min. then, pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell and adsorbed for 60 min to reach an adsorption equilibrium. Finally, Pyridine FT-IR spectra were collected under vacuum at 150 °C. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum was collected to detect the major active species in the ODS system. The Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) measurement was collected on Agilent 7890/5975C-GC/MSD (temperature program: 100 °C to 230 °C for 8 min at 15 °C/ min, then rising to 250 °C for 2 min, HP-5 MS column). 2.4 Catalytic tests In the ODS process, model oil (20 mL) and a required amount of catalysts (0.04 g) were poured into a three-necked ﬂask, the mixed solution was stirred vigorously to an absorption equilibrium. Then, the system was heated at 110 or 120 °C in an oil bath with air ﬂow of 125 mL/min. In this process, the upper oil phase was periodically withdrawn as samples and precipitated naturally before analyzing by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A) ﬂame ionization detection (FID) instrument. The detection process was started at 100 °C, then increased to 200 °C with a rate of 15 °C/min. Characteristic parameters of the column are as follows: HP-5 column, 30 m long × 0.32 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness. The adsorbed amount (qe) of the sulfides and oxidative sulfur removal efficiency were calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) qe= (CA-Ct)V/m (2) Sulfur Removal (%) = (1-Ct/CA)*100% Where Ct and CA (ppm) are the sulfur concentration of oil samples at a different time and the initial sulfur concentration of the fresh oil, respectively. V (L) and m (g) are the volumes of the model oil and the mass of the catalysts that were used in the experiments, respectively. 2.5 Hot filtration experiment Generally, after 1 h of reaction, the B-C3N4 catalyst was hot filtered out from the oil phase, and the ODS system without catalyst was continued to react under the same experimental conditions. Then, the B-C3N4 catalyst was returned to the ODS system at the 3 h. Similarly, the upper oil phase was periodically withdrawn as samples and further analyzed during the whole process. 2.6 Recycling of catalysts Recycling experiments were carried out as follows: the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. Then, the catalysts were separated from the oil phase by centrifuging and washed with dichloromethane. Being dried at 50 °C, the catalysts and fresh oils were added to a flask for the next cycle. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterizations of catalysts Herein, the intuitive spatial morphology of the as-prepared samples was carefully performed by SEM and TEM, respectively. As we can see from the SEM images in Fig. 1 a and b, both the g-C3N4 and B-C3N4 represent a film-like and a wrinkled structure, which is the typical morphology of 2D material [37]. Meanwhile, no obvious change is found to the morphology of B-C3N4, indicating that the doping of boron gives no changes to the layered architecture of B-C3N4. The TEM graph also agrees well with the conclusion from SEM. As displayed in Fig. 1d, B-C3N4 shows a layer-liked edge structure, which is similar to the g-C3N4 (Fig. 1c). Both Fig. 1c and d all show an ultrathin transparent and overlapped morphology. However, TEM images of g-C3N4 and B-C3N4 also exhibit a significant difference, a porous structure is observed for B-C3N4, which provides direct evidence that the B doping provides a porous structure for B-C3N4 sheets. This result is most likely related to the decomposition of the DES during the calcination process. To further exhibit the porous species of the prepared samples, their porous structure was verified through N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at −196 °C (Fig. 2 ). The results reflect that both samples had type III isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops based on IUPAC classification [38], which is attributed to the weak adsorbent-adsorbent interaction, indicating the porous structures of the samples. The hysteresis loops at 0.7 < P/P0 < 1.00 in the isotherms attributes to the slit-shaped pores, which is often detected on the aggregates of plate-like particles [39]. The corresponding pore size (Fig. 2: inset) further confirms the TEM conclusion that B-C3N4 distributes more pores at 2.85 nm and in the range of 10–50 nm. These results reveal an obvious mesoporous structure of B-C3N4 and imply that the DES plays an additional role during the forming process of the pores. Meanwhile, the specific surface areas of catalysts increase from 50 m2/g (g-C3N4) to 129 m2/g (B-C3N4) with the boron doped. The intrinsic structures of g-C3N4 and B-C3N4 were evaluated by XRD and depicted in Fig. 3 a. g-C3N4 shows two distinct diffraction peaks at around 12.8° and 27.6°, indexing to the (100) and (002) plane, respectively. They are related to the in-plane repeats among heptazine (C6N7) units, indicating that the g-C3N4 has a graphitic-like layer structure [19]. With boron doped, diffraction peaks of B-C3N4 are similar to the pristine g-C3N4, indicating the original graphitic C-N network still remains [40]. However, there is a slight shift of reflection peak (002) to a higher degree, illustrating the decrease of interlayer distance. Furthermore, the (100) diffraction peak becomes pronounced and shifts to a higher degree, indicating the reduction of planar size between C6N7 units. Additionally, FT-IR spectra of the samples are listed in Fig. 3b. For the g-C3N4, the absorption bands ranging from 1200 to 1800 cm−1 are assigned to CNC and CN stretching vibration modes of heterocycles [41]. After doping the B atoms, the main peaks from 1800 to 1200 cm−1 are remained. Meanwhile, the new broad peaks at 1380 and 1052 cm−1, indexing to the BN and NB(OH)2 bonds, are detected in B-C3N4, respectively, indicating that B atoms have been doped in g-C3N4 [42,43]. FT-IR results highlight the presence of boron species incorporated into the g-C3N4 framework. To further understand the chemical structures, XPS was used to characterize the B, C, N chemical state. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the bonding energy at 192.1 eV is assigned to the B-N-C groups [44,45], which illustrates the existence of B in the B-C3N4 catalysts. N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 4b) from 395 to 404 eV for pristine g-C3N4 is divided into several peaks at around 398.7, 399.8 and 401.0 eV, attributing to the sp2 bonded nitrogen in N-containing aromatic ring N-(C)2 [46], tertiary nitrogen groups N-(C)3 [28], and the presence of amino groups (CNHx) bonding configuration [47], respectively. With the dope of B atoms, a newly emerged peak, attributing to the BN bonds [48], was detected at around 397.8 eV. These results further confirm that B atoms have been doped in g-C3N4 frameworks. The C 1 s XPS spectra for samples as shown in Fig. S1 distributes three components at around 288.2, 286.4, and 284.8 eV, assigning to the sp2 bonding carbon (NCN) [49], CN bond [50], and graphitic carbon bonds [51]. However, the C 1 s spectra for B-C3N4 shows an increased CC/CC peaks and a newly appeared peak of the CO bond, which may attribute to the adsorption of external carbon sources. Here, the presence of BN signal suggests the substitution of carbon atoms by boron atoms in g-C3N4 framework directly. The existence of NB bonds, corresponded to the NB(OH)2 bonds in FT-IR results (Fig. 3b), shows that some B atoms are inserted on the edge of B-C3N4. According to the previous DFT calculation, during the doping process, B atoms occur sp2 hybridization and contribute their electrons to the adjacent N atoms [52]. This prediction is exactly consistent with the existence of BN bond in the experimental results. After the doping of B atoms, the pz orbits of B atoms are vacant, which makes B-C3N4 appear L acidity in a certain degree. To verify the change of acidity after boron doped, NH3-TPD was performed to evaluate the total surface acidity of g-C3N4 and B-C3N4 catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 5 a, a desorption peak at around 170 °C, corresponding to the NH3 adsorption on the weak acid sites, is observed for g-C3N4 [53]. Compared with g-C3N4, B-C3N4 shows increased NH3 desorption peaks centered at 260 and 407 °C, which is caused by the NH3 adsorbed on the acid sites with different chemical statuses. Meanwhile, a higher temperature on the desorption curve could correspond to a stronger strength of the acidity of the B-C3N4 [54]. NH3-TPD demonstrates that the enhancement of the surface acidity of the B-C3N4 by the introduction of B atoms. The intrinsic property of the acid sites on the g-C3N4 and B-C3N4 was explored by studying Pyridine FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Pyridine FT-IR bands observed at 1450 cm−1 and 1545 cm−1 are attributed to the L and Brønsted (B) acid sites, respectively. Furthermore, the bands appeared at 1490–1500 cm−1 attribute to a combination of Brønsted and Lewis (B + L) acid sites [55,56]. According to the quantitative analysis (Table 1 ), after doping B atoms, B acidity almost shows no changes, while the amount of L acidity remarkably increased from 46.12 μmol g−1 (g-C3N4) to 58.11 μmol g−1 (B-C3N4), indicating B atoms play an important role in the enhancement of L acidity. Pyridine FT-IR has further confirmed the enhancement of L acidity. Based on the above discussions, the grafting of L acidic sites on g-C3N4 is ascribed to the doping of B atoms, which would become a gainful factor while interacting with the electron-rich substrates. 3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 Inﬂuence of L acid catalysts for ODS systems To highlight the advantage of B-doped, the adsorption performance of B-C3N4 was conducted by adsorption of 4,6-DMDBT. The adsorptive experiments were carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 6 a). It is observed that g-C3N4 appears a negligible adsorption capacity (0.8 mg S/g). However, in the case of B-C3N4, the adsorption capacities is 5.2 mg S/g catalyst, which is remarkable 6.5 times higher than g-C3N4, indicating B-C3N4 possesses greater adsorption capacity to aromatic sulfides than g-C3N4. With the addition of the air and the catalyst, 4,6-DMDBT will be quickly removed from the oil phase (Fig. 6b). Obviously, the B-C3N4 shows a satisfactory catalytic performance compared to the g-C3N4, which indicates the doping of B atoms has a great influence on the ODS reaction. In the discussion of Pyridine FT-IR, B-C3N4 shows an obvious L acidity. Meanwhile, since the S atoms (3s23p4) in aromatic sulfides adopt sp2 hybridization and bond with the adjacent C, two pairs of lone electrons of S atom are contained in the aromatic sulfides, which makes aromatic sulfides show L basicity. In the early ODS process, L acid-base interaction is constructed between the B-C3N4 and sulfides, which endows B-C3N4 with a sulfur concentrated microenvironment and makes active sites more accessible. This process is in accord with the results of the absorption experiments. To further confirm the composition of the catalysts and oxidants, several controlled experiments were carried out. In this process, a significant difference has been observed at 2 h and shown in Fig. 6c. 33.6% of sulfur removal is observed as the introduction of g-C3N4, suggesting g-C3N4 has such a little catalytic ability. In the case of B-C3N4, the S-content in model diesel is removed from 200 to 11.5 ppm with 94.1% of sulfur removal in a short time. Meanwhile, in the atmosphere of nitrogen, the removal of 4,6-DMDBT is only 9.1%. When the fresh air pumps, the removal of 4,6-DMDBT will increase sharply to 94.1%. Besides, another experiment with pure oxygen was performed to further clarify the role of O2 in desulfurization systems. The result is almost the same as the condition of air, indicating the oxygen molecules is essential in the sulfur removal reaction. The detailed sulfur removal rate at different atmospheres are shown in Fig. S2. 3.2.2 Inﬂuence of L basic sulfides for ODS systems To further investigate the effect of L acid-base interaction on the removal of sulfides. Three aromatic substrates of different L basicity were selected for the experiments at 120 °C using B-C3N4 catalysts in Fig. 7 a. According to the results, S contents are decreased from 200 to 0, 4.6, 11.2 ppm for 4,6-DMDBT, 4-MDBT and DBT after 6h reaction, respectively. It shows that the B-C3N4 catalysts have impressive sulfur removal activity to different aromatic sulfides. Meanwhile, further analysis reveals a decreasing trend of sulfur removal presented in the order of 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT > DBT at the same reaction time. According to the previous study, the electron densities on sulfur atoms of 4,6-DMDBT, 4-MDBT, and DBT are 5.623, 5.583, and 5.576, respectively [33], which endows them the ability to donor electrons and appears different L basicity with the order of 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT > DBT. B-C3N4 would interact with the sulfide with higher L basicity. As such, for 4,6-DMDBT, active sites are more relatively accessible, which benefits its oxidation in ODS system. Thus, the sulfur removal decreases in the order: 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT > DBT. Besides, due to the existence of methyl, a steric hindrance on the sulfur atoms was also widely reported to influence the catalytic activity of different sulfides [33,57]. Herein, the results indicate that L acid catalysts and L basic sulfides exist an interaction, which weakens the influence of steric-hindrance. Therefore, this strategy highlights an option to overcome the steric-hindrance in some reaction process. Meanwhile, the results in Fig. S3 reveal a linear relation of ln (CA/Ct) with reaction time (T) of the ODS system on B-C3N4. The results demonstrate that the ODS reaction follows pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics. The apparent rate constants (K E) of the desulfurization are listed in Table S1. According to the value of K E at different temperatures, the activation energies (E a) in the catalytic decomposition of the three target molecules are calculated and shown in Fig. 7b. As shown in Fig. 7b, the E a of oxidation of 4,6-DMDBT, 4-MDBT, and DBT are deduced to be 12.2, 15.4, and 15.9 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, the value of E a exhibits a decreasing trend in the order of DBT > 4-MDBT > 4,6-DMDBT, indicating the sulfur removal process of 4,6-DMDBT is much easier. 3.2.3 Inﬂuence of sulfur concentration on the removal of 4,6-DMDBT The study of the influence of sulfur concentration on sulfur removal was discussed. As shown in Fig. S4, inﬂuence of 4,6-DMDBT concentrations varied from 200 to 500 ppm were investigated at 120 °C. In a 6h reaction, the sulfur removal will achieve to 100%, 99.2%, and 98.7% when the initial sulfur concentrations are 200, 350, and 500 ppm, respectively. The results indicate the ODS system can exhibit good sulfur removal performance for diesel products with different sulfur concentrations. 3.2.4 Inﬂuence of temperature on the removal of 4,6-DMDBT Inﬂuence of reaction temperature on the ODS was investigated under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S5, sulfur removal increases with the increment of reaction temperature. In a 4 h reaction, the reaction at 120 °C holds a higher sulfur removal (100%) than 110 °C. Higher temperature leads to higher sulfur removal, which is mainly ascribed to the accelerated movement of molecular at a higher temperature. Then, the effective collision probability among catalysts and the sulfides increases, leading to a higher 4,6-DMDBT removal. Therefore, in this system, the 120 °C was chosen as the economic and suitable reaction temperature for sulfur removal. 3.2.5 Stability and the recycling performance of the catalysts To investigate the indissolubility and stability of the B-C3N4, the catalyst was hotly ﬁltered out from the oil phase quickly after 1 h. As depicted in Fig. S6, the sulfur removal is no longer increased and stable at ∼60% from 1 to 3 h. When B-C3N4 is returned to the system at 3 h, the sulfur removal is obviously increased to 99%, which indicates that the catalytic active sites have been completely separated from the ODS system with the hot ﬁltration of B-C3N4. This is suﬃcient evidence to illustrate the catalyst does not dissolve in the oil phase, indicating that B-C3N4 easy to be separated and does not pollute the oil during the ODS process. Meanwhile, the recycling ability of B-C3N4 for this desulfurization system was conducted on removal of 4,6-DMDBT in model oil and the results were shown in Fig. 8 a. Sulfur removal remains higher than 90% after recycling 5 times. However, the sulfur removal decreases gradually with the recycling times increased. To further investigate the origin of the reduced sulfur removal, a small amount of the recycled catalysts phase was withdrawn and detected by XRD (Fig. 8b) and FT-IR (Fig. 8c). Compared with the fresh B-C3N4, some additional peaks are observed in the XRD results. Based on the analysis, the newly emerged peaks are assigned to the DBTO2 [58]. Meanwhile, the asymmetric vibration (1284 cm−1) and the symmetric vibration (1158 cm−1) of O = SO in the FT-IR spectrum also confirms the existence of DBTO2 in the catalysts phase [59]. Based on the above discussion, a conclusion can be drawn that the decreased sulfur removal of B-C3N4 during the ODS process results from the accumulation of reaction products on the active sites, leading to the decrease in sulfur removal rate. 3.2.6 The possible reaction scheme of the ODS system To understand the ODS process, GC–MS analysis was carried out after 2 h’ aerobic reaction. The upper oil phase was filtrated and analyzed directly, while the tetrachloromethane was used to extract the catalysts phase for further analysis. As we can see in Fig. 9 , the main peak of 4,6-DMDBT (m/z = 212.1) is detected in the oil phase. Two peaks ascribing to 4,6-DMDBT and 4,6-DMDBTO2 (m/z = 244.0) are detected in the catalysts phase [16], implying the oxidative reaction had already occurred in this system. To further understand the possible reaction scheme during the ODS process, ESR characterization was carried out to detect the intermediate active species. The result in Fig. S7 indicates that the superoxide radicals (O2 −) are the major active species during the ODS reaction. Combined with the results of the adsorption experiment, the proposal scheme of this ODS system can be concluded into four parts (see in Fig. 10 ): (1) 4,6-DMDBT and O2 in the air were adsorbed on B-C3N4, the Lewis acid-base interaction benefits to the close interaction between the catalysts and sulfides. (2) The O2 molecules in the air are activated to form the O2 − on the active sites of B-C3N4. (3) 4,6-DMDBT is oxidized to the sulfone by the highly reactive O2 − species. (4) When the sulfides consume O2 − away from the surface of the B-C3N4, the active sites on B-C3N4 are regenerated and the sulfones are transferred to the oil phase. And then, the catalytic reaction completes one cycle. 4 Conclusions In this paper, the electron structures of carbon nitride have been successfully tuned and utilized in ODS via a simple and efficient B-doped strategy. During the early adsorption process, Lewis acid-base interaction was enhanced between the catalysts and aromatic sulfides, which makes the active sites more accessible for the sulfides in diesel. Especially, B-C3N4 exhibited a 100% sulfur removal to 4,6-DMDBT at 120 °C and atmospheric pressure. With the different L basicity of sulfides, the catalytic ability was adjusted as follow: 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT > DBT, which almost unaffected by the steric hindrance of methyl groups. Our findings may offer a potential application of carbon nitride for the removal of 4,6-DMDBT with oxygen molecules in air as the oxidants for the production of clean diesel.

        "dc:description": "Regulation of electronic properties has been found to be an effective strategy to boost catalytic performance. In this paper, boron doped graphene-analogous carbon nitride (B-C3N4) was prepared and applied in aerobic oxidative desulfurization (ODS) as a metal-free catalyst. Detailed characterizations showed that B atoms have been doped into the framework of carbon nitride, which redistributes the electron structures and appears a stronger Lewis acidity. The B-C3N4 exhibited an impressive sulfur removal to aromatic sulfides, especially to 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophaene, and the catalytic ability of different sulfides was 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene > 4-methyldibenzothiophene > dibenzothiophene. A stronger adsorption progress was constructed between Lewis acid B-C3N4 and Lewis basic aromatic sulfides by the Lewis acid-base interaction, which benefits the next oxidation reaction during the ODS process. After recycling 5 times, the sulfur removal of B-C3N4 could still remain higher than 90%. The current method provides a potential application of B-C3N4 for the removal of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene.",
