A. K. Du Plessis*, J. S. Viljoen and C. J. Du Toit Department of Chemistry, Potchefstroom University for CHE, Potchefstroom 2520 (South Africa} (Received June 1, 1990; accepted September 18, 1990) Abstract Various alkynes were cyclotrimerized with NbCl5 as catalyst and CaHfyAlClz as co-catalyst at an Al/Nb molar ratio = 2 in CCL, at room temperature and pressure. The tendency of the alkynes to cyclotrimerize decreased in the following order: phenylacetylene > hex-1 -yne > hex-2-yne ~ hex-3-yne ~ oct-4-yne If phenylacetylene (X) was co-cyclotrimerized with another alkyne (Y), four different cyclotrimers were found, as represented by the following equation: X+Y > X3+X2Y+XY2+Y3 If the amount of cyclotrimers formed is plotted against the phenylacetylene mole fraction, a statistically random distribution of the products is observed. Differences with regard to the ideal random case are attributed to a polymerization reaction. During the cyclo- trimerization process there is therefore a statistically random coordination of the alkynes on the catalytic species, after which ring closure occurs to form the cyclotrimeric products. Introduction Alkynes can be cyclotrimerized and polymerized in the presence of a suitable catalyst [1 3]. The reaction of phenylacetylene and NbCl5 has been studied and certain characteristics of the cyclotrimerization reaction and of the mechanism have been unveiled [4]. The profile of the curve representing the rate of consumption of the alkyne indicates that the reaction is characterized by three phases [4, 5, 6]. Initially a very rapid reaction occurs that consumes 2 mol alkyne for every mol NbCl5 present to form the compound Cl3Nb(PhC=CHCl)2. This is followed by an induction period during which very little or no alkyne is consumed. This period can be shortened by using a higher concentration of alkynes [7], a more polar solvent [7], higher temperatures [5], a co-catalyst such as CaHsAlClg [5] or by irradiation with light [4, 11]. Termination of this period coincides with the commencement of the actual cyclotrimerization reaction. At this stage the Nb(V) species is reduced to a NbCIs species [8, Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Elsevler Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 270 5]. The slow reduction of the Nb(V) species and the sudden termination of the induction period can be explained by an autocatalytic effect of the NbCIs species that enhances the rapid formation of the NbCL, species [4]. During the third phase, a rapid decrease in the concentration of the acetylene occurs and the cyclotrimerization and polymerization proceed rapidly [4]. The formation of the cyclotrimer needs a metallacyclopentadiene in- termediate in order to proceed [9]. The temperature also influences these reactions. With phenylacetylene the yield of triphenylbenzene is lowered if the temperature of the reaction is increased, while the yield of the polymers is increased [6]. The solvent also determines the type of product formed. The more polar solvents favour the formation of cyclotrimers, while the non-polar solvents favour polymer formation [6]. In this study the influence of the type of alkyne on the cyclotrimerization and co-cyclotrimerization was investigated, as well as the mechanism of the reaction. Experimental The reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure (~85 kPa) and room temperature in a dry nitrogen atmosphere by injecting the alkynes and the ethylaluminium dichloride into a 5 cm3 solution of niobiumCV) chloride in carbon tetrachloride. The reaction vessel was a 50 cm3 glass flask fitted with a silicon rubber septum. The niobium(V) chloride solution was prepared by saturating carbon tetrachloride with the chloride and cooling the solution to a pre-determined temperature to obtain the necessary niobium(V) chloride concentration (18xl0~3 mol dm\"3). The niobium content was determined gravimetrically as NbaOg. The alkynes were used as received from the manufacturers. In all the reactions the alkyne to niobium mole ratio was kept at 30. During the co-cyclotrimerization reactions for the various mole fractions of phenylacetylene and hex-1-yne, hex-2-yne, hex-3-yne and oct-4-yne, the alkynes were mixed in such a way that the total concentration of alkynes was kept at 0.54 mol dm\"3. After completion of the reaction, 2.2 X 10 ~3 mol n-octane was added as internal standard to the reaction mixture as well as 5.6X10\"3 mol water to destroy the catalyst. GC measurements were undertaken with a Carlo Erba 4100 gas chro- matograph (fused silica capillary column, FS-SE-30 CB-0.25; 25 mXO.32 mm). Identification of products was done by GC/MS measurements. Products were separated and isolated by using column chromatography. The column was packed with Kieselgel 60, particle size 0.063-0.200 mm, and petroleum ether (40 60 C) was used as eluent. 271 Results and discussion The addition of ethylaluminium dichloride to a niobiumCV) chloride phenylacetylene system increased the cyclotrimerization activity and reached a maximum at mol ratio Al/Nb=2. All the other reactions were carried out at this mol ratio. Cyclotrimemation When different alkynes were cyclotrimerized with the catalytic system described, different yields of the trimers were obtained, as indicated in Table 1. Phenylacetylene gave the highest yield of cyclotrimers, while a decrease in yield was observed in the series from hex-1-yne to hex-3-yne and to oct- 4-yne. The yield of the disubstituted alkynes, sterically more crowded, is lower than that of the monosubstituted alkynes. Co-cyclotrimemation If two different alkynes in a mixture, X and Y, are co-cyclotrimerized, the reaction and the possible products formed can be represented by 6X+6Y Xs+XgY+XYa+Ys If it is assumed that the combination of the different alkynes to form the different cyclotrimers is a statistically random process, the basic ideas developed for complexes undergoing a reorganization reaction [10] e.g. ML^+MLg^MLaL' +MLL.2 can be applied. The distribution of the products as function of the mole fraction of the alkyne, can be presented in Fig. 1. The distribution curves of the cyclotrimers can be described by the equation cw.rm R- a^\\ R= relative amount of the trimer present in the mixture, f^, f, = mole fraction of the alkynes w=a+b a, b= number of moles of x and y bonded in one mole of the cyclotrimer c = constant (c = 1 for an ideal system c < 1 for a non-ideal system) The co-cyclotrimerization of hex-1-yne and phenylacetylene If hex-1-yne and phenylacetylene are mixed in different mol ratios in the presence of the catalyst, the following reaction takes place: ^ C^HgCECH + PhCECH 1| I + 1| I + I | + ^Hg^-^C^Hg C^Hg^^C^Hg C^rfg^^h X Y Xg X^Y XY^ Y. 272 TABLE 1 Yield of cyclotrimers obtained when the alkyne is added to a CzHsAlCla/NbClg = 2 mol ratio system in CCl4 Alkyne Cyclotrimer Yield (%) phenylacetylene hex-1-yne hex-1-yne hex-3-yne oct-4-yne triphenylbenzene tributylbenzene trimethyltripropylbenzene hexaethylbenzene hexapropylbenzene -100 58 52 34 24 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Mole fraction of Y Fig. 1. Statistically random distribution of cyclotrimers if alkynes X and Y co-cyclotrimerize to form the cyclotrimers X3, XaY, XYa and Yg. The relationship between the product distribution and the phenylacetylene mole fraction is indicated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, a deviation of a random distribution of the products from that of the ideal system represented in Fig. 1 can be observed. The yield of products is smaller than that expected for an ideal system. If the distribution curve of the ideal case is adjusted by the factor c with c<l, it fits the distribution found experimentally. The values of c for the different products are given in Table 2. If hex-2-yne and phenylacetylene, hex-3-yne and phenylacetylene or oct- 4-yne and phenylacetylene are added to the catalytic system, co-cyclotri- merization also occurs between the disubstituted alkynes and the phenyla- cetylene. These reactions can be represented by the following equation: 273 Mole fraction PhCsCH Fig. 2. The influence of the phenylacetylene mole fraction on the yield and distribution of the products during the co-cyclotrimerization of phenylacetylene and hex-1-yne; X3=(C4H9)3CeH3, X2Y=Ph(C4H9)2CeH3, XYa-Pha^H^CeHa, Y3=Ph3CeHa.

The values of c for the different cases are given in Table 2. It follows from these results that the number of products formed and their yields depend on the 274 specific mole fraction of the alkynes initially present in the mixture. Maximum yields of the co-cyclotrimers of the type XgY and XYg are obtainable at a mole fraction of Y at 3.5 and 6.5 respectively. The monosubstituted alkynes give a higher yield of cyclotrimers than the disubstituted alkynes, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2. Even in the co- cyclotrimers, the higher the content of the monosubstituted alkyne in the trimer with regard to the disubstituted alkyne, the higher the yield of that specific co-cyclotrimer. If hex-2-yne (X) co-cyclotrimerizes with phenylacetylene (Y), the yield of the cyclotrimer XYg is higher than that of XgY, as indicated by their c- values of 0.60 and 0.27 respectively (Table 2). Polymerization causes the deviation from the expected ideal yield of cyclotrimers. During the trimerization reaction two acetylene molecules must coordinate simultaneously to the active metal containing species to form the metalla- cyclopentadiene intermediate. For the polymerization reaction, one acetylene molecule will coordinate to a metal carbene intermediate to propagate the reaction. The cyclotrimerization reaction will suffer a larger steric effect and hence the disubstituted alkynes will give mainly polymers. The competition between the cyclotrimerization and polymerization reactions can be sum- marized by comparing the values of c in Table 2. The distribution of products formed, as illustrated in Fig. 2, indicates that a statistically random coordination of any of the different alkynes occurred at the metal centre to form the metallacyclopentadiene compound. The extent of the coordination of a particular alkyne depends on the relative concentration of that alkyne. This is also true for the third alkyne that is necessary to coordinate before ring closure can occur. As soon as the cyclotrimer has formed, the configuration of the trimer is fixed and no reorganization of the molecules is possible. One conclusion is that during the cyclotrimerization and co-cyclotri- merization of alkynes, a random coupling of the alkynes occurs to form the different ring compounds. The relative amounts of the different alkynes initially present during the co-trimerization reaction determine the yield of the particular products that are formed. The steric effects and the position of the triple bond of the alkyne also determine the degree of trimerization with regard to polymerization. The higher the content of monosubstituted alkynes incorporated in the ring compound, the higher the degree of cyclotrimerization.
