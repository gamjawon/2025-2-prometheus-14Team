By calcination and sulfurating Chestnut shell biomass (CNS), a solid acid catalyst was synthesized. In the preparation of the catalyst, a range of calcination temperatures (150 °C–350 °C) and time 2 h, a range of sulfonation temperatures (80 °C–160 °C), and a range of times (1–6 h) were examined in order to determine the effect on catalytic activity. The CNS300–SO3H catalyst was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett–Teller (BET), Fourier transforms infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy, N2–adorption and desorption, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A higher acid density (8.626 mmol/g–1) was found with the CNS300–SO3H catalyst, as well as a higher surface area (1198.12 m2/g–1). As part of the catalytic activity test, prepared catalysts were tested for their ability to catalyze the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol. Results revealed that a sulfonated activated carbon–CNS-derived acid catalyst is capable of esterifying oleic acid to about (95.25%) conversion. Chestnut-prepared catalysts showed better performance due to their high specific surface areas. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of the CNS300–SO3H catalyst made it stable for up to nine cycles of recycling. Catalyst is recyclable, and cheap feedstock makes the overall process more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

Introduction Energy security and environmental degradation are fundamental issues of the 21st century. Global warming and potential social disruption are the results of the dependence on conventional fossil fuels [1]. The use of biodiesel as one of the potential candidates for biofuels is gaining attention as an environmentally friendly, clean, and green energy source to meet future energy demands [2]. Therefore, biodiesel resources and a cost-effective production process are being sought along with a green protocol [3]. Waste biomass can be used as a source of activated carbon for catalysts to produce biodiesel, among these are coconut shells [4], seed shells [5], corncobs [6], and many others. In addition to having an interconnected network of micro, meso, and macro pores, activated carbon has a high specific surface area, making it ideal for immunization with acidic compounds [7]. Catalysts derived from agricultural waste are simple to prepare, easy to handle, biodegradable, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easy to obtain [8,9]. The agricultural sector produces a significant amount of waste throughout the world, which has become a source of concern for environmentalists and city planners in addition to affecting air quality and sanitation, contributing to pollution of the environment and posing health risks [10]. Many types of agricultural biomass and forestry residues, as well as herbaceous energy crops, can be used to produce bioethanol, energy, heat, and value-added chemicals [11]. As a result of the sulfonation of activated carbon, carbon–based catalysts derived from Chestnut shells are nontoxic, noncorrosive, and easily recyclable. Catalysts derived from activated carbon can catalyze both transesterification and esterification reactions simultaneously in a highly economical and environmentally friendly manner [12]. The material has chemical stability as well as a large surface area [13]. In esterification and transesterification, it has a hydrophobic surface property that attracts organic reactants and inhibits unfavorable reactions due to water presence [14]. The large–scale production of several catalysts is also hindered by the high cost of production. A sulfonated carbon is often formed by sulfonating activated carbon with H2SO4, and 1, 3 propanesulfonate. The sulfonated carbon has been found to be stable, and reusable. However, there are some drawbacks to using H2SO4, 1, 3 propanesulfonate, p-toluene sulfonic acid, and phosphoric acids that are limited in practical application due to corrosion, and environmental pollution [15]. In Yao et al. [16], it was found that H2SO4 required a high reaction temperature as well as a large amount of acid. A common problem with solid acid catalysts is the low concentration of active sites, the hydrophilic nature of the catalyst surface, and the leaching of active groups. Different types of heterogeneous acid catalysts based on sulfonated carbon have been reported in order to avoid the problems mentioned [17]. Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) has a pKa value of approximately 1.9, which makes it the simplest, most useful catalyst in chemical reactions. In addition, Methensulfonic acid is non-oxidizing, and easily handled, which makes them useful as catalysts [18]. This study aims to develop a new catalyst that is stable and sulfonated with methensulfonic acid for the production of esters based on activated carbon–CNS. Chestnut shell biomass can be readily obtained and is abundant in China, and it also contains cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. It has been suggested that CNS–biomass can be used as a carbon source for sulfonated carbon generation due to its composition. In addition, FT–IR, TGA, and N2 analyses were conducted on the as-prepared catalyst materials. The calcination and sulfonation temperatures, as well as the time parameters, were studied in terms of their effect on catalyst activity. As an environmentally safe method for the synthesis of ethyl esters, this study conducted ethanol with activated carbon–CNS catalysts. A wide range of free fatty acids can be trans(esterified) using methanol. For trans (esterification), a nontoxic reagent is required since it is toxic [19]. The oxygen-containing and biodegradable nature of ethanol makes it a promising candidate for fuel. In addition, the reusability of catalysts was examined in depth. It is our understanding that no study has examined the catalytic performance of sulfonated activated carbon–CNS catalyst for the production of ethyl ester from oleic acid when pretreated by 5 N HCl–MeOH solution. The biggest novelty of this work is the development of an efficient solid bio-based catalyst for esterification. Materials and methods Preparation of 5 N HCL–MeOH solution To prepare the 5 N HCl–MeOH solution, 100 ml methanol (MeOH) was taken in a two–necked glass reactor, and then the HCl gas was dissolved in the MeOH made up 5 N HCl–MeOH solution. The normality of the sample was determined by titration. A solution of 5 N HCl–MeOH was used to pretreat the CNS–biomass. Catalyst preparation The CNS-biomass was ground into a size of 150–200 mm using a grinder. In a ceramic boat, CNS–biomass powder (1:1, biomass powder was impregnated with 5 N HCl–MeOH solutions for 4 h at room temperature. A tubular furnace with nitrogen flow was used to carbonize the dried impregnated CNS–biomass, which was then calcinted at 150 °C–350 °C under nitrogen flow for 2 h. A rate of 10 °C min–1 was used for calcining CNS–biomass until the desired temperature was reached. To remove residual chemicals, the carbonized sample was washed with ethanol and hot water, and then with hot water until pH 7 [20]. There are five different types of activated carbon, CNS150, CNS200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350, where CNS represents numbers denoting the calcination temperatures. Carbonized samples were dried for 24 h at 105 °C. Eq. (1) was used to calculate biomass yield from biomass weight. P1 and P2 are the weights of activated carbon and biomass produced, respectively. (1) Y i e l d ( % ) = P 1 P 2 × 100 % As a final step, the activated carbon was sulfonated in a batch reactor set in an oil bath at various temperatures of 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 °C with a 1:2 ratio of methanesulfonic acid to activated carbon for various times (1–6 h). In order to remove the entire remaining methanesulfonic acid from the catalyst ethanol was washed. A vacuum oven was used to dry out the final catalyst (CNS300–SO3H) overnight at 60 °C. Esterification and acid density were used to confirm catalyst activity. Also, catalyst yield was calculated based on biomass weight and Eq (1). Catalyst performance The esterification of synthesized sulfonated catalysts determines their activity. In ethyl oleate production from oleic acid, solid acid CNS300–SO3H derived catalyst performance was investigated. Using a two–neck round bottom glass flask with a condenser and thermometer, the reaction was carried out. In this study, the catalyst performance was investigated under a variety of reaction conditions, but at a constant reaction temperature of 80 °C. At molar ratios of 10:1, (16.56 g of ethanol to 7.68 g of oleic acid) was investigated. The catalyst loadings were 150 wt% and the reaction time was 2 h with 100 rpm agitation speed. Once the reaction was complete, the glass flask was removed from the bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. A centrifugal separator was used to separate the products from the catalyst. The ethyl oleate phase was then heated in a drying oven after being separated from the aqueous and organic phases. Ethyl oleate acidity was determined by titration with 125.5 mmol/L potassium hydroxide (in triplicates). As a result of the conversion, the following result was obtained: (2) Co n est ( % ) = ( C i − − C t ) C i where Ci is the initial acid value and Ct is the acid value measured at time t. The acid value was calculated as follows: (3) acid value ( mg KOH g − − 1 ) = 56.1 × N × V W where N = strength of KOH (in normality); V = volume of KOH consumed; W= weight of sample. Characterization of catalyst Titration was used to determine the acid density, sulfonic, and carboxylic contents on the catalyst surface [21]. To identify the functional group that had been introduced onto the catalyst, Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) analysis was performed using Perkin Elmer 1650 Spectrometer. N2–adsorption and desorption analysis were performed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) (Thermo Finnigan, Sorptomatic 1990 series) to determine the total surface area and pore volume. A Thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA), Mettler Toledo Model 990 was also used to determine the catalyst's thermal stability. Result and discussion Effect of carbonization temperature and time on pore size and surface development The catalyst activity was primarily influenced by the calcination temperature, structure, and acidity of the pretreatment (Table 1 ). A comparison was made between the raw CNS, CNS150, C200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350 and the increment in surface composition and structure. A weighted average of yields was determined at 20%, 26%, 31%, 38% and 34%, respectively, at CNS150, C200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350. As the biomass to liquid (5 N HCl–MeOH) ratio was 1:1, the calcination temperature was 150 °C–350 °C and the calcination time was 2 h, volumes of the pores 0.08 cm3/g, 0.98 cm3/g, 1.10 cm3/g, 1.40 cm3/g, 1.80 cm3/g, and 1.52 cm3/g for raw CNS, CNS150, CNS200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350, respectively. Surface area (SBET) o.14 m2/g–1 , 0.78 m2/g–1 , 3.95 m2/g–1 , 1082.45 m2/g–1 , 1325.64 m2/g–1 , and 1006.38 m2/g–1 for raw CNS, CNS150, CNS200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350, respectively. In addition, the diameter of the pores increased from 1.85 nm for the raw CNS to 3.72 nm for the carbonization temperature at 300 °C. As a result, the prepared activated carbon–CNS meets all the requirements for use as catalyst support. The specific surface area, acid density, and pore volume of 5 N HCl–MeOH pretreatment increase significantly at 300 °C. According to Betiku et al. [22], cocoa pod husk was calcination and the resultant surface area was 2.76 m2 g–1, the pore volume was 0.012 cm3/g, and the pore size was 1.77 nm. Pores exhibited were abundant and of different sizes and shapes allowing more methanesulfonic acid to enter the carbon bulk, which in turn resulted in high covalent binding of carbon with the –SO3H group. It was previously reported that the synthesis of carbon catalyst at pyrolysis temperatures (400 °C–500 °C) will produce soft aggregated, cross-linked polymers [23]. While 5 N HCl–MeOH pretreatment at 150 °C–250 °C is not obvious, carbonization with 5 N HCl–MeOH might cause excessive breakdown of macromolecules and easy removal of organic portions. Activated carbon–CNS, however, becomes harder with higher calcination temperatures (350 °C), resulting in a drastic reduction in pore volume. Activated carbon–CNS has a high porosity level and is a form of amorphous carbon [24]. Acid density 0.08 mmol/g–1, 0.63 mmol/g–1, 1.04 mmol/g–1, 1.28 mmol/g–1, 1.81 mmol/g–1, and 0.92 mmol/g–1 for raw CNS, CNS150, CNS200, CNS250, CNS300, and CNS350, respectively. In contrast to peanut shell carbonized for 15 h, the carbonization procedure is faster and requires less energy [25]. The carbonization temperature affects activated carbon–CNS pore structures and the pretreatment with 5 N HCl–MeOH is influenced by the carbonization temperature. By using 5 N HCl–MeOH, it is very easy to prepare activated carbon with large pore sizes, high pore volumes, and high specific surface areas compared to concentrate HCl-treated biomass. The catalytic activity of a catalyst is highly dependent on the calcination temperature, which determines the intensity of active sites. The effect of different calcination temperatures was investigated on bovine bone waste [26], and Murumuru kernel shell was used as the precursor biomass for making acid biochar [27]. In order to synthesize economical and eco-friendly catalysts, agricultural waste is considered a viable source, and appropriate disposal methods are sought [8]. Optimization of sulfonation conditions Fig. 1 a shows the effects of sulfonation temperature on catalytic capability in esterification. The sulfonation of activated carbon CNS300 is conducted at different temperatures from 80 °C to 160 °C and various times 1 h to 6 h, when the volume of methanesulfonic acid (4 g) and active carbon (2 g) is fixed, as well as the agitation speed of 100 rpm. To determine the catalyst's acid density (Fig. 1b). It can be seen that CNS300–SO3H has the highest sulfonic content. A higher sulfur content was detected after sulfonation than before, indicating the successful functionalization of sulfonic groups on the surface of activated carbon–CNS. The surface of carbon materials has a hydrophobic character which is more important for the interaction with FFA in ester preparation processes [28]. The efficiency of catalyzed esterification increases with sulfonation temperature in a parabolic curve. In this study, a yield of 95.25% was obtained when the sulfonation temperature was 140 °C, irrespective of the reaction time range and contributing to high surface area and pore volume. At the activated carbon–CNS surface, the sulfonation process dramatically decreases the amount of surface functional groups. As a result of the particle size reduction, the activated carbon surface is more effective in contact with methanesulfonic acid, increasing the effectiveness of the sulfonation process. When the temperature is raised above 140 °C, the ethyl oleate yield and acid density are significantly reduced. Sulfonation at 140 °C for 5 h results in a rigid structure with fewer –SO3H active sites, and higher catalytic activity. As a result of the longer sulfonation time (6 h), the acid density and ethyl oleate content were lower. A shorter sulfonation time and a higher esterification yield (%) were shown in the prepared CNS300–SO3H catalyst and a lower acid density (2.97 mmol/g–1 vs 8.626 mmol/g–1) was also observed. Mateo et al. [29] reported the density of –SO3H at the maximum sulfonation temperature and time of 92 °C was 0.2398 mmol/g–1. The sulfonation temperature influences the stability of –SO3H groups in carbon–based structures. The collapse of the carbon skeleton and side reactions caused by excessive temperatures may decrease the introduction of –SO3H groups [30]. As a result, the optimal sulfonation temperature is selected at 140 °C. The carbon catalyst for low–temperature sulfonation has a high density of sulfonic acid groups [15]. Certain duration is naturally required for the linkage of the chemical bonds to complete the sulfonation procedure, where active sites of –SO3H groups are sufficiently loaded on the carbon materials support. The CNS300–SO3H catalyst can therefore be incorporated with a high density of both strong (–SO3H) and weak (COOH, and OH) acid sites. Based on the above analyses, it is evident that the introduction of –SO3H groups in CNS300–SO3H is relatively rapid, and 5 h is chosen as an appropriate sulfonation time considering and energy costs, which is superior to 15 h reported in other studies [31]. CNS300–SO3H of characterization FT–IR analysis As shown in Fig. 2 a-c, raw CNS–biomass, activated carbon–CNS, and sulfonated CNS for –SO3H were analyzed by FT–IR. In raw CNS–biomass, major absorption peaks were observed at 1175.53 cm−1 and 1065.66 cm−1 caused by C–O stretching of carbohydrates (lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose) [22]. The C–O–C stretching of cellulose and hemicellulose in CNS–biomass may have caused the peak. A broad absorption band at 2973.64 cm−1, 2785.12 cm−1, and a minor band at 575.45 cm−1 could be ascribed to the –OH stretching and bending vibration of water molecules [32,33]. A minor peak detected in raw CNS–biomass could be attributed to C–H stretching, whereas sharp bands in raw lignin were attributed to aromatic ring vibration and C–H bonding deformation. In addition, distinct and minor sharp peaks were seen in raw CNS–biomass at 1250.81, 1375.41, 1513.68, 1625.32, and 1755.12 cm−1, representing the CO stretching vibration groups [34] (Fig. 2a). Activated carbon–CNS300 almost completely absorbed the major absorption bands of raw CNS–biomass, indicating that the temperature chosen for calcination damaged the carbohydrate–lignin matrix sufficiently. Activated carbon–CNS300 exhibited prominent absorption bands at 542.82, 581.12, 1083.14, 1164.24, 1223.50, 1332.52, 1508.42, 1602.43, and 1723.23 cm−1 (Fig. 2b). As a result of FT–IR observations on CNS300–SO3H, the peak shifts, and intensity changes confirmed structural changes during sulfonation. Raw CNS–biomass and activated carbon–CNS300 have significantly different spectra than sulfonated CNS300–SO3H. Sulfonated CNS300–SO3H exhibits peaks at 1587.71, 1695.65, 2995.53, and 2800.52 cm–1 only (Fig. 2c). A successful sulfonation process and the presence of –SO3H group on the surface of sulfonated carbons were confirmed by the emergence of additional bands at 1323.72 cm−1 and 1185.95 cm−1 (SO stretching), 1045.42, 850.12, 570.12, and 531.92 cm−1 (–SO3H stretching) on CNS300–SO3H IR spectrum. It was evident from the absorption spectrum of CNS300–SO3H that the major absorption bands of activated carbon –CNS300 were almost absent, indicating that –SO3H was sulfonated. As a result of the FT–IR spectra, it was found that grafting –SO3H group onto CNS300–SO3H using the sulfonation method was feasible. CNS300–SO3H thermal stability A thermo–gravimetric analysis was used to investigate the thermal stability profile of CNS300–SO3H catalyst from 100 to 800 °C under nitrogen flow. As shown in Fig. 3 , CNS300–SO3H was thermally stable at 550 °C. Weight loss was observed in the range of 100 °C to 250 °C as a result of the vaporization of chemically and physically adsorbent water and then slowly and steadily lost weight. There was also a weight loss region between 450 °C and 550 °C in which 10% of the weight loss was attributed to the thermal decomposition of oxygen-containing groups from catalyst frameworks. At 550 °C to 650 °C, there was a rapid loss of residue carbon deposition, resulting in a weight loss of 7.2%. It is similar to the thermal decomposition of carbon–based solid acid catalysts reported elsewhere [5]. At temperatures near 550 °C, CNS300–SO3H catalysts demonstrated good performance and good operational stability. Due to its more ordered structure (higher aromaticity) and high surface functional group concentration, the catalyst prepared from CNS300–SO3H exhibits better stability. SBET and pore volume analysis According to Fig. 4 a and b, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of mesoporous CNS300–SO3H showed typical type–IV curves with clear nitrogen condensation steps characteristic of mesopores. The isotherms show similar hysteresis loops of type H1. The pore size distribution curves show similar shapes with high pore size uniformity, and the most probable pore diameter of obtained mesoporous CNS300–SO3H are all centered at about 3.6 nm. Although the SBET and pore volume of the activated carbon–CNS increased significantly from 0.64 to 1325.64 m2/g and from 0.14 to 1.80 cm3/g, respectively, activated carbon–CNS was sulfonated with methanesulfonic acid, resulting in a significant decrease in SBET and pore volume. The nitrogen adsorption data for the raw CNS biomass, activated carbon–CNS, and CNS300–SO3H catalyst are shown in (Table 2 ). Due to sulfur species covering the support, the SBET and pore volume of CNS300–SO3H decreased considerably (1198.12 m2/g and from 1.01 cm3/g, respectively). The reduction in surface properties of the activated carbon confirms its sulfonation, confirming its potential as a catalyst [35]. According to Odude et al. [36], banana peel catalyst has a surface area of 4.442 m2/g–1 . As the sulfonation temperature rise, SBET and the pore volume of catalysts decreased, which was attributed to the sintering of the catalyst surface at a high sulfonation temperature (140 °C). Reusability and leaching of CNS300–SO3H The CNS300–SO3H catalyst reusability was confirmed by conducting consecutive repeat experiments. The yield dropped from 95.25% to 86.08% after nine cycles, as shown in Fig. 5 a Overall, the catalyst still showed good stability and performance after nine cycles. Compared to other research, CNS300–SO3H catalyst had superior stability in the reusability [39]. In order to determine the reusability potential of the CNS300–SO3H catalyst, the reaction conditions were as follows: temperature 80 °C, time 2 h, catalyst content 150 wt%, and ethanol-to-oleic acid molar ratio (10:1) with 100 rpm agitation speed. After the reaction was completed, the catalyst was centrifuged and washed with n-Hexane and n-Butanol several times. Separated catalysts were dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven, dried in a desiccator, and reused. As CNS300–SO3H has a large surface area and a high density of mesopores, larger lipid molecules may find it easier to adsorb on the catalyst surface and approach the active acid sites. Our sulfonated activated carbon materials could therefore be used for catalyzing the reactions of large lipid molecules. Subsequently, a similar procedure was followed for every cycle of reaction. The reduction in catalytic activity results from sulfate leaching from the catalyst during the esterification process, resulting in a decreased acid capacity of the catalyst after each cycle [40,41]. As a result, the acid density of the catalyst varies from 8.626 mmol/g–1 to 5.895 mmol/g–1 for the first cycle to the ninth cycle (Fig. 5b). This study found that CNS300–SO3H catalyst with a lower surface area blocked reactants and products, lowering catalytic activity. As a result of the large pores of the catalyst (10.63 nm on average), the reactant might be able to interact with more acid sites. As a result of the presence of hydrophilic functional groups on activated carbon, the CNS300–SO3H can incorporate large amounts of hydrophilic molecules (–SO3H, COOH, OH). As a result of such incorporation, hydrophilic solvents, including water, adsorb into the carbon framework [42]. There were no significant differences based on the FT–IR spectrum comparison of fresh and recovered CNS300–SO3H catalysts after nine runs. The new small peak at 1125.42 cm–1 in the recovered CNS300–SO3H catalyst shows that (SO stretching) reacts with air. A new peak at 1002.09 cm–1 was observed in the FT–IR spectrum of the reused catalyst, attributed to (–SO3H stretching). Results indicated that the CNS300–SO3H structure of the reused catalyst was well preserved. A reusable and easy-to-handle alternative to solid acids, the CNS300–SO3H has shown promising catalytic activity. Compared to the fresh CNS300–SO3H spectrum, the spectra show new peak information at 678.23 cm–1 (Fig. 6 ). The results indicate that the catalyst remained very stable during these reactions. Further studies will be conducted to increase the reusability of the CNS300–SO3H catalyst in our future work. An operating cost analysis based on the factors involved in the reaction was performed based on the considerations for estimating a catalyst's production cost. The energy costs associated with the upstream and downstream of the reaction were not evaluated here, as these remained constant throughout the assays. Approximately USD 17.25 to 22.5 lb−1 of the CNS300–SO3H catalyst will cost USD regarding the catalyst material. A catalyst cost estimate was derived using equations by Bento et al. [43]. Effect of CNS300–SO3H on various feedstock yields It also studied how the CNS300–SO3H catalyzed the esterification of Jatropha curcas seed oil and fried oil. Using the same optimized reaction conditions, J. curcas seed oil and fried oil yielded 95.30% and 92.65% esterification, respectively. CNS300–SO3H high esterification activity makes it a suitable raw material for the production of esters. Compared to the previous literature reports [44], the CNS300–SO3H catalyst is more effective in esterifying oleic acid, J. curcas seed oil, and fried oil. The CNS300–SO3H catalyst developed for ethyl esters production should also be applicable to a wide range of feedstocks. Conclusions Using CNS–biomass for ester production, a novel and efficient CNS300–SO3H composite catalyst has been synthesized that is both economical and environmentally friendly. A novel method for carbonization was described in this article. The prepared catalyst displays a relatively high acid density (8.626 mmol/g–1) despite its relative surface area (1198.12 m2/g–1 ). In the production of ethyl oleate from oleic acid, 95.25% and 86.08% of the catalyst were successfully employed. In addition, the catalyst was tested for reusability for up to nine cycles without noticing a decrease in catalytic activity. However, needs to enhance the stability of the catalyst further, in order to prevent the deactivation of functional groups during the reaction. In addition to being a promising catalyst and alternative to several expensive catalytic materials, the CNS300–SO3H catalyst can also be applied for the synthesis of petrochemicals. After sulfonation, however, it is necessary to prevent the leaching of active sites from CNS300–SO3H catalysts. Currently, work is being done in this direction. Carbonization can be achieved at 300 °C, and sulfonation at 140 °C. Chemical processes employing CNS300–SO3H are particularly suited to its characteristics of good stability and robust structure. Among the catalysts used for the production of ethyl ester, CNS300–SO3H is the most effective and economical catalyst.

        "dc:description": "By calcination and sulfurating Chestnut shell biomass (CNS), a solid acid catalyst was synthesized. In the preparation of the catalyst, a range of calcination temperatures (150 °C–350 °C) and time 2 h, a range of sulfonation temperatures (80 °C–160 °C), and a range of times (1–6 h) were examined in order to determine the effect on catalytic activity. The CNS300–SO3H catalyst was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett–Teller (BET), Fourier transforms infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy, N2–adorption and desorption, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A higher acid density (8.626 mmol/g–1) was found with the CNS300–SO3H catalyst, as well as a higher surface area (1198.12 m2/g–1). As part of the catalytic activity test, prepared catalysts were tested for their ability to catalyze the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol. Results revealed that a sulfonated activated carbon–CNS-derived acid catalyst is capable of esterifying oleic acid to about (95.25%) conversion. Chestnut-prepared catalysts showed better performance due to their high specific surface areas. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of the CNS300–SO3H catalyst made it stable for up to nine cycles of recycling. Catalyst is recyclable, and cheap feedstock makes the overall process more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.",
