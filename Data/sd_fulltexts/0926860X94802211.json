The irreversible surface species identified by the Fourier transform IR spectra after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 are (in the sequence of the increased stability when the temperature increases): bidentate bicarbonate, bridged carbonate, bidentate carbonate, unidentate carbonate (except for pure ZrO2) carboxylate and ionic carbonate. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum is, in general, resolved into five peaks of carbon dioxide only, in contrast to that recorded after interaction with carbon monoxide on two copperless aerogels where peaks of carbon dioxide and hydrogen were also detected [D. Bianchi, T. Chafik, M. Khalfallah and S.J. Teichner, Appl. Catal. A, 105 (1993) 223.] and were correlated with the formation of the formate species. This species is not detected after the interaction with carbon dioxide. Key words: aerogel catalysts; carbonate type species; methanol synthesis; zirconia support I. Introduction The behaviour of zirconia supported aerogel catalysts towards the interaction with carbon monoxide was examined previously for catalysts with and without CuO. The formate species is easily formed above 100 on pure zirconia and on zirconia containing 5% of ZnO. On this second catalyst the formate species is transformed at 300 into various, carbonate type, species (ionic and unidentate *Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 33) 72448333, fax.

Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 carbonate and carboxylate) whereas it remains stable at this temperature on pure ZrO2. On zirconia containing 5% CuO (with or without ZnO) the formate species is not detected at any temperature after the interaction with carbon monoxide and only carbonate type species are observed, already at 25. This behaviour may be correlated with the nature of the pivotal intermediate in the synthesis of methanol, which is the subject of a controversy [ 1,2]. Some authors consider that this pivotal role is played by the surface formate species [3-7], whereas other authors prefer for this role the surface carbonate species [ 8-10]. A second point in this controversy concerns the nature of the reactant, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, which leads to the pivotal intermediate. In some earlier papers, either carbon dioxide [ 5- 7,11-15 ] or carbon monoxide [ 3,4,8,9,16 ] was considered as the main reactant in the formation of this intermediate but in more recent papers carbon dioxide [ 17,18 ] as well as carbon monoxide are both assumed to lead to the synthesis of methanol. Any attempt at the clarification of this point may be obscured by a possible con- version of the CO2 + H2 mixture by the water-gas shift reaction [8,9], and, con- versely for a CO + H2 mixture, by the possibility of the oxidation of carbon monoxide by the catalyst components such as ZnO or copper oxides and by water vapour. Now, very often carbon monoxide which is the main reactant is admixed with carbon dioxide which is considered as beneficial to the synthesis [ 19]. The oxidation of a reduced catalyst by carbon dioxide and by the generated water cannot be discarded. Hence such a redox system may be at the origin of the interconversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide [ 17 ]. It is therefore of interest to examine first the possibility of the formation of various intermediates from carbon monoxide and then from carbon dioxide (without hydrogen). The interaction between the aerogel catalysts and carbon monoxide was studied in parts II and III [ 1,2] where it was shown that the formate species is formed on copperless catalysts only, whereas the carbonate type species are formed on all catalysts. It is the purpose of this paper to report the nature of the species formed with carbon dioxide and, in particular, to investigate the possibility of the formation of the formate species which is considered as the pivotal one, even for carbon dioxide as reactant [ 5]. This type of investigation is extended in the forthcoming papers to the interaction with methanol and with the mixtures CO + H2 and COz + Hz. 2. Experimental The experimental methods, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reaction (TPR), Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectroscopy (resolution 4 cm- 1) during the TPD, and finally the preparation and properties of the aerogel catalysts, were described previously [ 1,20] It is recalled that the gas mixture of 5% CO2/ 3% Ar/92% He in the present study is introduced at a desired temperature onto the solid where argon, which is not adsorbed, is used as a marker to determine the beginning of the adsorption which is followed by mass spectroscopy. After satu- D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 ration of the solid by carbon dioxide the system is cooled in the presence of the gas mixture down to 25 and swept with pure helium. The TPD is then started and the analysis of gases (CO2, CO, He, H2) is performed by mass spectroscopy. In the experiments described below only carbon dioxide was detected. For the FT- IR spectroscopy the same flow system is employed, with a metallic IR cell (1 cm 3 volume). It enables to record the FT-IR spectrum of the adsorbed species (the whole spectrum in one second), in the presence of the gaseous reactant during the increase (15 min -1) of the temperature (in a similar way as in TPD) in the range 25-600. The surface area of pure ZrO2 aerogel and of binary aerogels ZnO (5%)/ZrO2 and CuO (5%)/ZrO2 was in the range 200-220 m2/g and that of the ternary aerogel CuO (5%)/ZnO (5%)/ZrO2 was in the range 150-160 m2/g. 3. Results It has been shown previously that for the four aerogel catalysts examined the behaviour of the two copperless catalysts is different with respect to the interaction with carbon monoxide than that of the copper containing catalysts [ 1,2]. In partic- ular, the last class of catalysts chemisorbs carbon monoxide irreversibly at 25 and is reduced in its presence already at 100. These two classes were therefore studied separately [ 1,2]. In the case of the interaction with carbon dioxide only minor differences are observed, as is shown below. This study also concerns all four aerogel catalysts. The FT-IR spectra of adsorbed carbon dioxide exhibit almost the same IR absorption bands, with some differences in the intensity and the TPD spectra are also very similar. For this reason the experimental results for pure ZrO2 aerogel are well detailed whereas for the remaining three catalysts: ZnO/ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO 2 only the differences with respect to pure ZrO2 are mentioned. 3.1. Transient methods The isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 was studied as follows: the catalyst is first standardized at 400 under oxygen [ 1,2], sweeped with helium and cooled to 25. A mixture of 5% CO2/3% Ar/92% He is then passed over the solid with a flow-rate of 60 cm 3 min- i. The concentration of all gases is recorded by mass spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the isothermal evolution with time-on-stream of carbon dioxide and of argon (tracer). Carbon monoxide is not detected, and neither is hydrogen, in contrast to the results of the isothermal adsorption of carbon monoxide [ 1,2]. The total amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed on pure zirconia at 25 is 340/xmol/g. By sweeping with pure helium at 25, 20/xmol/g of carbon dioxide are desorbed (reversible fraction) and therefore 320/zmol/g of carbon dioxide are irreversibly adsorbed, giving various carbonate type species (see D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 Ar (x 1.7) 60o C02 ,C E. ~ 4oo 0 E ::L 20o rr ) J I I o 45 9O 135 Time (s) Fig. 1.

The temperature programmed desorption (TPD under helium) which follows the previous adsorption gives the spectrum of Fig. 2a showing poorly resolved peaks and shoulders due to various surface species exhibiting gradually increasing activation energies of desorption (Table 1 ). In contrast to the adsorption of carbon monoxide [ 1,20], no hydrogen or carbon monoxide are formed during the TPD experiments of preadsorbed carbon dioxide. The total amount of carbon dioxide desorbed is 315/zmol/g, which matches the previous figure of irreversible adsorp- tion. In Table 1 are also given the approximative amounts of carbon dioxide evolved, calculated after deconvolution of the spectrum into five peaks (assumed symmetric and numbered from 1 to 5). The corresponding activation energies are calculated assuming first order desorption and a frequency factor 1013 s- 1 [ 21 ]. For higher temperatures of isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide (up to 350, spectra not shown) the amount of adsorbed carbon dioxide decreases, in contrast \" E ~ 240 _ 0 . . 120 - n- O I I I I I 100 200 300 400 500 Temperature : Fig. 2.

The TPD spectra (not shown) after cooling under carbon dioxide down to 25 still exhibit the same profile as that of Fig. 2. The temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) under carbon dioxide (5% CO2/3% Ar/92% He) neither shows any evolution of hydrogen which, in the case of carbon monoxide, results from the interaction of this gas with the surface hydroxyl groups [ 1 ]. Apparently these groups do not seem to play any major role in the adsorption of carbon dioxide. It can be seen from Fig. 2b that the TPD spectrum of carbon dioxide adsorbed at 25 on ZrO2 previously dehydroxylated at 700 under helium is very similar to that of the hydroxylated initial zirconia. The only difference is the decrease of the shoulder at Tm= 120. The total amount of carbon dioxide irreversibly adsorbed at 25 and desorbed during the TPD (392 /zmol/g) is higher (+77 /zmol/g) than that obtained previously for the non- dehydroxylated solid (315/~mol/g). It appears therefore that the dehydroxylation at 700 [ 1,20] decreases the number of sites which fix the carbon dioxide under the form of the less stable species which desorbs at Tm= 120. It is shown below that this species is the bidentate bicarbonate whose formation requires the hydroxyl groups. The dehydroxylation increases, however, the number of more stable spe- cies, mainly those giving the peaks at T m = 210 and Tm = 275, which is clear from the comparison of Figs. 2a and b. Concerning now the second aerogel, CuO/ZrO2, also standardized under oxygen and cooled under helium, the isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 gives the same type of trend as in Fig. 1. The total amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed is 190 /zmol/g and 171 /zmol/g are irreversibly adsorbed (a 47% decrease with respect to the amount irreversibly adsorbed on pure ZrO2; 320/xmol/g). The profile of the TPD spectrum of adsorbed carbon dioxide is again very similar to that shown in Fig. 2a for pure ZrO2. The total amount of carbon dioxide desorbed is 167/zmol/ g, in agreement with the amount irreversibly adsorbed at 25 ( 171/zmol/g). The deconvolution of the TPD spectrum (not shown) gives again five peaks at Tm = 90, 145, 190, 260 and 305. The amount of carbon dioxide desorbed for each peak and the corresponding activation energy of desorption are given in Table 2. If the 224 D.

In particular, this decrease affects the species desorbing at higher temperatures (Tm = 260 and 305). In general, the addition of CuO to ZrO2 also decreases the temperature Tm of desorption of various species and the activation energies of desorption. The species are the same, as is shown below by the IR spectroscopy. Similarly as for pure ZrO2, the second aerogel was dehydroxylated at 700 under helium and the TPD spectrum of carbon dioxide adsorbed at 25 showed a similar profile as that of the non-dehydroxylated solid. The differences concern again the absence of the less stable species, desorbing at Tm=90 (bidentate bicarbonate, see below) which may be therefore correlated, as previously, with the hydroxyl groups. The isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide at temperatures higher than 25 (up to 350) shows again that, as for pure ZrO2, the amount of this gas adsorbed is decreased. The corresponding TPD spectra after cooling exhibit again the same profile. The nature of the species formed on CuO/ZrO 2 at higher temperatures of adsorption does not seem therefore to be modified. For the third aerogel, ZnO/ZrO2, the results of the isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25, and of the TPD experiments are given (almost the same values as for pure ZrO2) in Table 3. The profile of the TPD spectrum is still similar to that of ZrO2 and for the dehydroxylated solid (at 700) a similar decrease of the intensity of the first peak at Tm= 100 (bidentate bicarbonate, see below) is recorded, pointing again to the interaction between carbon dioxide and the hydroxyl groups to generate this first species. For higher temperatures of the isothermal adsorption of carbon dioxide the amounts adsorbed decrease as for the other aero- gels. Finally, for the ternary solid CuO/ZnO/ZrO 2the total amount of carbon dioxide irreversibly adsorbed isothermally at 25 is 99/xmol/g. It is therefore the smallest found on all four aerogels. These results and those of the TPD experiments are given in Table 4. The profile of the TPD spectrum allows again a deconvolution into five peaks whose temperatures Tm are mentioned in Table 4.

As before for the dehydroxylated solid, the intensity of the first peak at Tm= 90 (bidentate bicarbonate, see below) decreases. These results show that the addition of CuO and ZnO to ZrO2 does not result in the superposition of the properties of the individual solids, like pure ZrO2, ZnO/ ZrO2 and CuO/ZrO2.During the preparation of binary and ternary aerogels the deposition of CuO and/or ZnO onto the ZrO2 support is made only on the surface of zirconia and not in the bulk [20]. The CuO and/or ZnO additives contribute therefore to the surface properties of the zirconia support. It is then of interest to observe that the addition of ZnO to ZrO2 produces an increase of the amount of irreversibly adsorbed carbon dioxide desorbed during the TPD experiment (315 ~ 345/xmol/g), whereas the addition of CuO to ZrO2 produces, in contrast, a decrease of this amount (315 ~ 167 /xmol/g). For the ternary solid only 84 /xmol/g of carbon dioxide are desorbed during the TPD (Table 4). On the basis of the additivity of the adsorptive properties, the amount of carbon dioxide on the ternary aerogel desorbed during the TPD experiment should be 315-148 + 30= 197/zmol/g. These figures compared with the previous experi- mental results, 99/zmol/g and 84/zmol/g of carbon dioxide, tend to show that such a decrease of the adsorptive capacity of the ternary aerogel does not result Table 4 Adsorption and interaction of carbon dioxide with CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel Peak no.

Characterization of the adsorbed species by FT-IR spectroscopy All four aerogels were standardized in the metallic FT-IR cell, in a flow of oxygen ( 150 cm3/min) at 400 for 2 h. A flow of helium for 10 min preceeded the cooling of the sample down to 25. The adsorption of carbon dioxide was performed by a flow of 5% COJHe (150 cm3/min) followed by a sweeping (desorption) in helium for 5 min before the beginning of the TPD (15/min) process followed, this time, by FT-IR spectroscopy (one spectrum every second). Figs. 3A and B give the FT-IR spectrum recorded on pure ZrO2 aerogel after the initial adsorption and during the TPD steps. In the presence of carbon dioxide a supplementary sharp IR band at 2352 cm- 1 (not shown) is observed and disappears during the sweeping with helium at 25. It corresponds to the reversible fraction of adsorbed carbon dioxide, discussed in Section 3.1. After adsorption at 25, the IR bands are recorded isothermally ( in the range 1100-2400 cm- 1 ) at 1225, 1325, 1425, 1445, 1575, 1620, 1723 cm -1 (spectrum a, Fig. 3A). In the range 3000- 4000 cm- 1 of the hydroxyl groups the IR band at 3770 cm- 1 of zirconia (spectrum a, Fig. 3B) decreases by adsorption of carbon dioxide and shifts to 3763 cm-1 while a new IR band at appears 3615 cm- 1 (spectrum b, Fig. 3B). The second IR band of hydroxyl groups at 3677 cm- 1 is not modified by the adsorption of carbon dioxide (spectrum b, Fig. 3B). The complexity of the whole recorded spectrum agrees with the number of adsorbed species (at least five) detected using the TPD analysis with the mass spectrometer as detector (Fig. 2). The TPD experiment in helium, following the adsorption of carbon dioxide leads to a simpler FT-IR spec- trum which allows the determination of the structure of the adsorbed species. The TPD process produces a decrease of the intensity of the IR bands giving a better resolved spectrum. The shoulder at 1723 cm- 1 disappears around 180 (spectrum d, Fig. 3A) and at 225 the group of IR bands at 3615 cm- 1, 1620 cm- 1 and 1225 cm-1 (spectrum c, Fig. 3B) also vanishes. In particular, the disappearance of the 3615 cm- 1 band leads to an increase of the initial IR band of the hydroxyl groups at 3770 cm- ~ which is now detected at 3748 cm- 1 (spectrum c, Fig. 3B) while the second band of the hydroxyl groups, at 3677 cm-1, is not modified. Finally, above 250 the well resolved IR bands at 1556 cm-~ (initially at 1575 cm-1), 1445, 1425, 1325 cm-1 decrease progressively in intensity and vanish at 350. The adsorption of 5% CO2/He on three other aerogels, ZnO/ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 produces similar FT-IR spectra. Fig. 4A compares the FT-IR spectrum after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 on ZrO2 with those registered on ZnO/ZrO 2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 aerogels (on CuO/ZrO2 the spectrum observed is practically the same as that observed on ZrO2).

Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 229 1354 cm-1 respectively on ZnO/ZrO 2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2. The band at 2350 cm-~ (not shown) is still observed but with a lower relative intensity than on pure ZrO2. This shows that the same species are present on both aerogels and their bands dominate the recorded spectrum. The similarity of all FT-IR spectra recorded is in agreement with the TPD results (Section 3.1. ) which indicate a very similar profile for all four aerogels. However more differences between the various solids are observed after desorption in the range 180-240. On both aerogels, ZnO/ZrO 2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2, the following bands which previously dominated the Fr-IR spectra: 3615, 1723, 1620 and 1225 cm-1 (Fig. 4A) vanish by this desorption temperature and lead to the spectra of Fig. 4B. On CuO/ZrO2 aerogel the spectrum has still the same profile as that observed on pure ZrO 2. The differences between ZrO2 and zirconia supported ZnO and ZnO/CuO, revealed by this desorption result from the quality of the resolution of the IR bands at 1445 and 1416 cm- 1. On ZnO/ ZrO2 aerogel (curve b in Fig. 4B) these IR bands are strongly overlapped by an intense IR band at 1370 cm -1 and by IR bands at 1480 and 1530 cm -1 (not detected on pure ZrO2). The IR band at 1556 cm- 1 which is well resolved on pure ZrO2 is recorded as a shoulder on ZnO/ZrO 2 aerogel at 1570 cm- I (spectrum b, Fig. 4B). The shoulder at 1342 cm-1 on pure ZrO2 is not observed on ZnO/ZrO2 because of a high intensity of the band at 1370 cm- ~. On CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel the IR bands at 1445 cm- ~ and 1420 cm- 1, previously detected on pure ZrOz, are well observed but new IR shoulders at 1370 and 1530 cm-1 (which overlap the band at 1556 cm- 1 of pure ZrO2) are now detected. These results indicate that new adsorbed species were formed on supported aerogels and that it is mainly the presence of ZnO that produces the modifications of the properties of carbon dioxide adsorption on the zirconia support. For temperatures of desorption higher than those of Fig. 4B the intensity of all bands decrease progressively (as on pure ZrO2) and the bands are no longer detected above 350. tO 1.6 1.2 0 C 0.8 0 J~ <[ 0.4 I I I I 1900 1500 1100 Wavenumber (cm-1) Fig. 5.

Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 Figs. 4A and B, just discussed, compared the FT-IR spectra recorded during the TPD process after adsorption of carbon dioxide on various solids. Fig. 5 compares now the spectra recorded at 250 under the mixture 5% COz/He for two identical masses of pure ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2. The same characteristics as those of Fig. 4 are again observed but now it is possible to compare the intensities of the IR bands. If the species are qualitatively different on both aerogels their quantities seem comparable, assuming similar extinction coefficients. This agrees with the data of Tables 1 and 3 which indicate that 235 and 251/xmol/g of carbon dioxide are still adsorbed at 210 respectively on ZrO2 and on ZnO/ZrO2 after the TPD process. 4. Discussion The TPD spectra using the mass spectrometer as detector show that the adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 generates on all four aerogels at least five adsorbed species, following an approximative deconvolution of strongly overlapped peaks. The mean temperatures of desorption Tm of these species (Tables 1 to 4) give the order of the stability of these species, measured by the activation energy of desorp- tion. On copperless solids (ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2) the adsorbed species are more stable than on CuO containing solids. The presence of CuO in CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ ZnO/ZrO2 leads to a decrease of the quantity of adsorbed carbon dioxide, partic- ularly in the ternary solid. An attempt at the identification of the adsorbed species is based on the FT-IR spectrum. First, the species formed on pure ZrO2 are discussed and then the mod- ifications due to the presence of ZnO and/or CuO are presented. On pure ZrO2 the IR band at 2352 cm- 1, observed under carbon dioxide and vanishing by desorption at 25, corresponds to the weakly chemisorbed carbon dioxide on cation sites of the surface [4,22] probably on Zr ~+ sites because the intensity of this band is severly decreased on supported catalysts. During the TPD process between 25 and 220 (Figs. 3A and B) the following IR bands vanish: 3615, 1723, 1620 and 1225 cm-1. In this temperature range of desorption the TPD spectra (Fig. 2) indicate that two species disappear. The IR bands at 3615, 1620 and 1225 cm-1 are characteristic of the bidentate bicarbonate species, concerning the vibration frequencies v-OH, Vas-CO and a-OH [3,23,24], respectively (see also Table 1 of ref. [1]): OH I o/,C' o \\ / M The band of ~'s C-O which should be in the range 1310-1480 cm- 1 [23,25,26] is probably located around 1430 cm-1 and overlaps the bands at 1445 and 1416 D. Bianchi et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 cm- 1 remaining after desorption at 250 (Fig. 3A). The decrease of the intensity of the spectrum in this range ( 1450-1410 cm- 1) during the TPD process from 25 to 250 (Fig. 3A) may be considered as resulting from the disappearance of the v~ CO band. Now, the bidentate bicarbonate species is formed by adsorption of carbon dioxide on only one kind of the hydroxyl groups of zirconia aerogel [20]. Indeed, the intensity of the IR band of these groups, at 3770 cm-t, decreases, whereas the IR band of the second kind of these groups at 3677 cm- 1, is not affected (Fig. 3B). During the TPD process (Fig. 2) only carbon dioxide is detected by mass spectroscopy (no carbon monoxide or hydrogen is detected). This indicates that the hydroxyl groups which became a part of the bidentate bicarbonate species are regenerated as the hydroxyl groups of the surface (Fig. 3B). It has been observed in the previous work [1,2] that carbon monoxide reacts also with the hydroxyl groups but only at temperatures of adsorption higher than 150. This interaction produces the formate species which decompose (or desorb) into carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This process is therefore entirely different and in the present case the formation and the desorption of the bidentate bicarbonate species may be thus represented by a different mechanism: OH OH [ OH I /cTPD I CO2(g ) + M -~ O O ~ CO2(g ) + M N / M The dehydroxylation of ZrO2 aerogel at 700 (Fig. 2b) leads to a very marked decrease of the first part of the TPD diagram. This is in agreement with the fact that the bidentate bicarbonate species cannot be formed without the participation of hydroxyl groups and that this species is desorbed/decomposed at low temperature (Fig. 3A). Assuming that the first peak of the TPD (Fig. 2) represents the decomposition of the bidentate bicarbonate species the surface concentration of this species may be estimated from the amount of carbon dioxide evolved in this peak (taking account of the surface area of the sample [ 1 ] ). Table 5 gives these values for all four aerogels and gives the comparison with the initial surface concentration of the hydroxyl groups [2]. It is seen that for the three solids (the value of the concen- tration of the hydroxyl groups is not available for the fourth aerogel [2] ) only Table 5 Surface concentration of bidentate bicarbonate species Aerogel ZrO2 ZnO/ZrO2 CuO/ZrO2 CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 Concentration of bicarbonate (in molec./cm 2) Concentration of OH's (in OH/cm 2) 8.9.1012 2.2.10 ~3 1.2.1013 2.4.1013 7.5.1012 1013 2.8.1012 D. Bianchi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 about one half of these groups are consumed to form the bidentate bicarbonate species. This also agrees with the FT-IR spectra of Fig. 3B which show that only one type of the hydroxyl groups [20], characterized by the band at 3770 cm- ~, is exhausted by adsorption of carbon dioxide. Going further, the IR band at 1723 cm- 1 may be related to the presence of the C=O bond in the bridged carbonate species [23,27,29]\" o II /CN O O M\"( O\" I I CO2(g) + M 2 ~'-M 1 M2 This species presents others IR bands for Gs-CO and vs-CO, but these bands appear usually below 1100 cm- 1 [23,24,27-30] where the transmission in our system is too low to give useful information. The disappearance of the IR bands after desorption in the range 180-240, described above, leaves a well resolved spectrum (Fig. 3A) with IR bands at 1556, 1445, 1425 and 1325 cm-t. The TPD process using the mass spectrometer as detector indicates (Fig. 2) that, at least, three adsorbed species are still present on the surface. Some of the previous bands are characteristic of well defined species. In particular, the band at 1445 cm- ~ (see Table 1 of ref. [ 1 ] ) corresponds to the ionic carbonate [ 3,24,27,29,31-34], probably formed according to the mechanism: O = CO 3 CO2(g) + M ++ ~ M ++ The remaining bands of the previous group of bands, at 1556 and 1325 cm- correspond to the bidentate surface carbonate [ 8,9,23,24,27,31 ] representing t,as- CO and us-CO respectively, species formed according to the mechanism: O II /C\\ O O o II \\ / CO2(g ) + M 1~ M The difference A = 231 cm- 1 between the two IR bands is in favour of a bidentate structure [ 35,36]. For the unidentate carbonate the value of A is usually smaller than 100 cm --1 The last remaining IR band at 1425 cm- 1 may be ascribed to the ~,s-CO vibration frequency of a surface carboxylate species [ 27,29-31,33 ], attached by its carbon to a cationic site, according to the mechanism [27,28]\" 0% /o- c I C02(g ) + M + M ++ D. Bianchi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 The frequency Vas-CO around 1550 cm- 1 (see Table 1 of ref. [ 1 ] ) is probably overlapped by the IR bands of the bidentate bicarbonate. The stability of this carboxylate species seems higher than that found in other studies [37]. Another hypothesis would be to consider the band at 1425 cm-l as due to polydentate carbonates [ 35 ]. Finally, the comparison of the adsorption of carbon dioxide onto the present zirconia aerogel and onto a xerogel of zirconia [ 38-40] shows that the same type of species are formed on both types of solids, in particular the bidentate bicarbonate, the bidentate and bridged carbonates and the ionic carbonate. Going now to zirconia supported aerogels, the introduction of ZnO (5% ZnO/ ZrO2) gives minor modifications of the IR spectra after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25. This results from the fact that the IR bands of the bidentate bicarbonate and of the bridged carbonate dominate the spectra. Only after desorption of these species at T> 220 the spectra reveal the effect of the presence of ZnO. The IR bands (Figs. 4A and B) of the ionic carbonate ( 1445 cm- t), of the carboxylate (1425 cm -~) and of the bidentate carbonate (1556 cm-~), previously observed on pure ZrO2 are still detected but new IR bands are also observed. The shoulder at 1530 cm -~ associated with an intense IR band at 1370 cm -a (Fig. 4B) may correspond to a second bidentate carbonate (noted II) representing the vibration frequencies Vas-CO and v~-CO respectively. The difference A = 160 cm- 1 is indeed in favour ofa bidentate carbonate. On pure ZnO, IR bands at 1522 and 1327 cm- 1 were attributed to polydentate carbonates [41 ]. The shoulder at 1480 cm-1 asso- ciated to the band at 1370 cm- ~(Fig. 4B) may, on the other hand, correspond to the unidentate carbonate vibration, frequencies va~-CO and v~-CO, respectively: 0% /O- C I o I CO2(g ) + M ++ ~ M + The high intensity of the 1370 cm- ~ band thus results from the contribution of three vibration frequencies v~-CO of three carbonate species: bidentate carbonates I and II and unidentate carbonate. For copper containing aerogels, CuO/ZrO2, only minor differences with pure ZrO2 are observed. This may be related to low adsorptive properties of copper oxide towards carbon dioxide [42,43]. In the case of the ternary solid CuO/ZnO/ ZrO2 the IR bands observed are the same as on pure ZrO2 (bidentate bicarbonate, bidentate and bridged carbonates, ionic carbonate and carboxylate species). The shoulder at 1530 cm -~ and the intensity of the band at 1370 cm -~ (Fig. 4B) indicate the presence of a second bidentate carbonate, noted previously II and observed on ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel, but not on pure ZrO2. But in contrast to ZnO/ ZrO2 aerogel the presence of the unidentate carbonate is not detected on the temary aerogel. D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 219-235 The comparison of the adsorption properties of four aerogels shows that the properties of the zirconia support are observed on all solids (formation of bridged carbonate, bidentate bicarbonate, bidentate carbonate I, ionic carbonate and car- boxylate). But the presence of ZnO on any aerogel leads to the formation of a second bidentate carbonate, noted II. On the ZnO/ZrO 2 sample a new adsorbed species is detected and identified as the unidentate carbonate, but this influence of ZnO on the properties of pure ZrO2 support is no longer observed in the presence of CuO, because on the ternary aerogel CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 the unidentate carbonate is not recorded. Only bidentate carbonate II is the new species that ZnO favours on ZrO2 in the presence of CuO. However, the presence of at least seven adsorbed species is not observed by TPD on these ZnO containing aerogels, probably because the activation energies of the various adsorbed species are too close to allow a distinct deconvolution. Fig. 5 shows that at temperatures higher than 250, which correspond to the experimental conditions for the methanol synthesis, the bridged carbonate and the bidentate bicarbonate are not present on the surface even in the presence of 5% CO2/He and cannot be involved in the synthesis of methanol. The comparison of the FT-IR spectra on all four aerogels after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25 with the spectra after adsorption of carbon monoxide [ 1,2] shows that (i) the differences are important on the copperless solids (carbon monoxide gives mainly the formate species which may decompose into the car- bonate species, mainly on ZnO/ZrO2) whereas (ii) on the copper containing aerogels the spectra are almost identical ( 1 ) to those observed after adsorption of carbon dioxide. Indeed, on CuO containing aerogels carbon monoxide adsorbed on copper ions is oxidized into carbon dioxide at 25 and spills over [ 1,2] onto the other ions present on the solid. The net results are therefore the same as after adsorption of carbon dioxide. It is therefore of interest to observe that the presence of ZnO in the catalyst favours, in the presence of carbon monoxide or of carbon dioxide, the formation of various carbonate type species (see above). It does not seem that these species are localized on ZnO (which is in a small amount) but probably spill over on the main constituent of the catalyst, which is the zirconia support, as was already shown for carbon monoxide [ 1,2] and hydrogen [20] spillovers.

The interaction between carbon dioxide and the aerogel catalysts: pure ZrO2, ZnO/ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 produces very similar results on all four catalysts. The irreversible surface species identified by the Fourier transform IR spectra after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25°C are (in the sequence of the increased stability when the temperature increases): bidentate bicarbonate, bridged carbonate, bidentate carbonate, unidentate carbonate (except for pure ZrO2) carboxylate and ionic carbonate. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum is, in general, resolved into five peaks of carbon dioxide only, in contrast to that recorded after interaction with carbon monoxide on two copperless aerogels where peaks of carbon dioxide and hydrogen were also detected [D. Bianchi, T. Chafik, M. Khalfallah and S.J. Teichner, Appl. Catal. A, 105 ( 1993) 223.] and were correlated with the formation of the formate species. This species is not detected after the interaction with carbon dioxide. Keywords aerogel catalysts carbonate type species methanol synthesis zirconia support References [1] Bianchi D. Chafik T.

        "dc:description": "The interaction between carbon dioxide and the aerogel catalysts: pure ZrO2, ZnO/ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 produces very similar results on all four catalysts. The irreversible surface species identified by the Fourier transform IR spectra after adsorption of carbon dioxide at 25°C are (in the sequence of the increased stability when the temperature increases): bidentate bicarbonate, bridged carbonate, bidentate carbonate, unidentate carbonate (except for pure ZrO2) carboxylate and ionic carbonate. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum is, in general, resolved into five peaks of carbon dioxide only, in contrast to that recorded after interaction with carbon monoxide on two copperless aerogels where peaks of carbon dioxide and hydrogen were also detected [D. Bianchi, T. Chafik, M. Khalfallah and S.J. Teichner, Appl. Catal. A, 105 ( 1993) 223.] and were correlated with the formation of the formate species. This species is not detected after the interaction with carbon dioxide.",
