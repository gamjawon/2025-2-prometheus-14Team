The state of manganese species on the alumina as a function of manganese loading was determined by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Temperature-pro- grammed techniques and X-ray diffraction. The supported crystalline phase with small particle size was evidenced to be the same as the unsupported crystalline Mn304. A monolayer dispersion of Mn304 onto the surface of alumina could be obtained only by incipient wetness impregnation. Some interesting effects of milling were found, namely a lattice contraction of Mn304 and encapsulation by Degussa alumina.

Introduction Unsupported pure Mn304 is known as a suitable catalyst in several catalytic processes, e.g. selective reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene [ 1,2] and selective C-alkylation (i.e. phenyl ring alkylation) of phenol with methanol [3]. Unfortunately Mn304 is a relatively low surface area oxide (e.g. lower than 50 me/ g as shown in [4]). An effective approach to create a high surface area is the dispersion of the Mn304 on a high surface area support e.g. alumina. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to find the appropriate MnH salt and the optimal conditions for decomposing and oxidizing the supported Mnn salt into Mn304. We should also mention in passing that few surface studies of alumina supported Mn304 have * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

This might be due to the failure in finding the appropriate manganese salt. In previous papers, the preparation of the near-stoichiometric [4] and non- stoichiometric [6] Mn304 as well as their redox behavior have already been reported in detail. In this paper, a series of alumina supported Mn304 catalysts have been prepared and the manganese species formed on the alumina as a function of manganese loading have also been characterized by temperature-programmed tech- niques combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS). In this study, also some notable effects caused by milling, namely lattice contraction and encapsulation, were found. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Manganese loading was defined as the weight ratio Mn304/A1203. It has been ascertained that Mn (OAc)2\" 4H20 (acetate) could be thermally decomposed in air (350 for 0.5 h) quantitatively into Mn304 as evidenced by several tests, namely, to prepare one mole of Mn304 three moles of Mn~I acetate are needed (see also [4] ). Accordingly, the Mn304/A1203 catalysts could be prepared by wet and 'dry' impregnation as follows: ( 1 ) Incipient wetness impregnation of alumina powder with an aqueous solution of Mnn acetate, followed by rapid drying at about 120 and subsequently calcining in air at 350 for 0.5 h. (2) The so-called 'dry' impregnation [7], i.e. co-milling Mn(OAc)2.4H20 with alumina thoroughly in an agate mortar, followed by thermal decomposition in air at 350 for 0.5 h. The colors of the catalysts prepared by the above methods range from light to dark brown with increasing manganese loading. 2.2. Method of characterization Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), oxidation (TPO), reoxidation (TPRO) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used to characterize the redox behavior of the prepared catalysts. The description of the measurement was reported in previous papers [6,8]. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (D/Max-2000), employing Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation. The X-ray tube was operated at 50 kV and 150 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a V.G. Escalab-5 electron spectrometer using non-monochromatized A1 Kal.2 radiation. The anode was operated at 10 kV and 20 mA. W. Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 191 3. Results The alumina supports used in this study are Ketjen/Cynamid CK300, Degussa A1203 C and Merck Tonerde A1203, denoted, respectively, as CK-300, D-AI203 and T-AI203. They are described in Tables 1 and 2 of ref. [9]. Owing to the weak interaction between manganese and alumina (see text and ref. [5]), the catalysts could be prepared by incipient wetness impregnation to obtain a monolayer dispersed phase as well as a crystalline phase of Mn304. The 'dry' impregnation is not suitable for preparing a monolayer dispersed phase as will be discussed later. The detectable species formed on the alumina is undoubtedly Mn304 as confirmed by XRD. A series of CK300 supported Mn304 with different manganese loading were prepared by wet impregnation as listed in Table 1. To ascertain the manganese species formed on the CK300 as a function of manganese loading, several techniques were used and interesting results were obtained as follows: 3.1. XPS results In order to get information on the appearance state of the supported Mn304, the Mn (2p)/A1 (2p) peak intensity ratios of the above listed catalysts were recorded. The dependence of the I~,~ 2pl/IA~2p~ on the manganese loading is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1, from which one can see that as the manganese loading is raised, the Mn(2p)/Al(2p) intensity ratio increases monotonically, but after more than 10/ 100 of the Mn304 has been deposited this ratio increases rather slowly. The slow increase in intensity ratio, in our opinion, implies a decrease in the dispersion of the manganese species, probably due to the appearance of the three-dimensional phase of Mn304. In other words, the two-dimensional phase seems to be only available on the surface of CK300 when the manganese loading is smaller than or equal to 10/100. This merits further confirmation with XRD.

XRD results XRD was used to observe the three-dimensional crystalline phase of Mn304 present on the CK300. It turns out that as the manganese loading is raised to 15/ 100, the diffraction peak (at 35-4020) of the CK300 broadens as seen in Fig. 2e, indicating the build-up of the Mn304 crystalline phase on the CK300 (note: the strongest diffraction peak of Mn304 is at about 3620 as shown in File No. 24- 734). The appearance of crystalline Mn304 becomes predominant when the man- ganese loading reaches 20/100 as shown in Fig. 2f. The build-up of the crystalline Mn304 seems therefore to start at manganese loadings higher than 10/100. This is consistent with the aforementioned XPS results. 3.3. TPR results The TPR profiles of the catalysts prepared are shown in Fig. 3. One can see that for catalysts with manganese loading of 2.5/100 to 10/100, the TPR profiles comprise a single reduction peak (Fig. 3a-3c). As the manganese loading is raised to 15/100 and higher, the peak splits into two (Fig. 3d-3f). This situation is more 4.0 3.0' 2.0 I. O! I I s 1'o i'S 2'0 2's 30 Mn loading (wt.%) Fig. 1.

Wang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 or less similar to that of VO~/TiO2 [ 10]. The Tmax (temperature of reduction peak maxima) for the first peak being 380-400, while that for the second peak is 455- 500. According to the XPS and XRD results mentioned above, we may conclude that the low-temperature reduction peak (LTRP) can be assigned to the reduction of the two-dimensional dispersed phase (at 380-400) and the high-temperature reduction peak (HTRP) to the reduction of the three-dimensional crystalline phase (at 455-500) of Mn304. It is obvious that in the case of higher manganese loading ( >~ 15/100), the monolayer dispersed and the crystalline phase of Mn304 coexist on the surface of the CK300 support. In addition, it is of interest to note that as the manganese loading is raised, the Tmax of the HTRP increases from 455 to 500, indicating the particle size dependence of the Tmax, which means that the larger the particle is, the higher is the Tm,x. The fact is that 500 is just the Tm,x for the unsupported crystalline Mn304 prepared by thermal decomposition (in air) of Mn\" acetate (see Fig. 3b of ref. [4] ). Accordingly, the TPR peak having the lowest Tmax (say 455) can be assigned to the reduction of the so-called para- crystalline [ 10] Mn304. In sum, the CK300 support appears to function purely as a dispersing agent [11] implying a weak interaction between manganese and alumina. 3.4. TPO results The TPO profiles of the catalysts prepared are shown in Fig. 4, which also comprise the TPO profile of the CK300 measured under the same conditions. One can see that all of the TPO profiles possess a low-temperature peak at about 150, e .J , i i i t I I I i00 300 500 \"ZOO Fig. 4. TPO profiles of impregnated Mn304/CK300 catalysts.

Wang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 195 the peak size seems to be manganese loading dependent, that is the higher the manganese loading, the smaller is the peak. This peak, in our opinion, is due to the escape of oxygen instead of water (note: the emerging gas was dried over MgC104 before entering the TC cell) and might be assigned to the removable oxygen linked with the so-called soluble AI ions [ 9,12,13 ] of the CK300, since the TPO profile of CK300 alone also exhibits such a peak as shown in Fig. 4a (see also Fig. 7 of ref. [9] ), However, the unsupported Mn304, prepared by thermal decomposition (in air) of Mnn acetate, does not show such a low-temperature peak in its TPO profile (see Fig. 6 of ref. [ 4 ] ). Except for the TPO profile of the catalyst containing a 2.5/100 Mn loading (Fig. 4b), the others show TPO profiles very similar to that of the unsupported Mn304: the escape of oxygen at high temperature continues up to 700 (see Fig. 6 of ref. [4]). We conclude that from the TPO profiles of the prepared catalysts, it is hard to differentiate the monolayer dispersed phase from the crystalline phase of the sup- ported Mn304. This may be due to the fact that owing to the weak interaction between manganese and A1203, the monolayer dispersed phase, under oxidizing atmosphere, might readily aggregate. 3.5. TPRO results TPRO profiles (i.e. TPO profile after TPR) of the catalysts prepared show little differences, as seen in Fig. 5. Worthy of note is the enlargement of the low- temperature peak of oxygen escape. This provides some clues to the aggregation of the monolayer dispersed phase during TPR, causing the surface of CK300 to be more naked and thus more removable oxygen to be released. Moreover, as the manganese loading is raised, the peak of the oxygen uptake (negative TC signal) becomes larger and the Tmax shifts upscale and reaches finally about 400, which is just the Tmax of the unsupported Mn304 (see also Fig. 7b of ref. [4] ), indicating also the particle size dependence of this Tmax. On the basis of the results of our XPS, XRD and TPR studies, both the two- dimensional and the three-dimensional phase of the supported Mn304 could be obtained by using incipient wetness impregnation of alumina with Mn\" acetate solution. The threshold of the monolayer dispersed phase based on this study lies between 10/100 and 15/100 Mn304 loading or 7.2/100 and 10.8/100 Mn metal loading. The latter value is consistent with the reported data of ca. 8/100 (see ref. [ 5 ] ), which is the threshold for alumina supported MnO2 and Mn203. The fact that the three different MnOx/A1203 ~ have nearly the same value of threshold could be attributed to the weak interaction between MnO~ and A1203. As mentioned above that except for the monolayer dispersed phase, the 'dry' impregnation can be adopted in place of the wet one for preparing the supported 1 The alumina used in [5] has nearly the same size of surface area as that of CK300 used in this study. 196 W.

However, what will be obtained when Mn304 instead of Mn(II) acetate is milled with alumina? Can we use this simplest method to prepare the supported Mn304? In addition, what will happen with solid-solid wetting to occur between the two oxides, if the interaction between them is rather weak? Obviously, it is a topic very interesting from the fundamental and the practical point of view. The so called 'dry' impregnation [ 7 ] generally consists of heating a mechanical mixture of the active precursor and of the carrier. This leads to the spontaneous monolayer dispersion of the active precursor onto the support. It has been found that the catalysts obtained from heating (500, 12 h in nitrogen instead of air, to prevent Mn304 from oxidizing to Mn203 [4] ) a mechanical mixture of the Mn304 and of the alumina show a completely different behavior to that obtained from the wet impregnation. Worthy of note is that no spinel-like compound, e.g. MnA1204, could be detected for the mechanically mixed catalysts, which on the contrary reveal the same XRD patterns as that before calcination. Further investigation indicated that the difference in behavior originates directly from the mechanical force, that is the strong milling, rather than the long period of calcination. Accord- ingly, a series of mixtures were prepared by milling A1203 with Mn304 [ obtained from thermal decomposition (in air) of Mn~1 acetate] in a agate mortar and inves- tigated thoroughly using several techniques. The interesting results obtained are reported as follows: W. Wang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 3.6. TPR results 197 The TPR profiles of the milled Mn304-A1203 catalysts comprise only a single reduction peak (not shown in the figure), which are quite different to that of the (wet) impregnated catalysts mentioned above as follows: 1. The Tmax values of the milled catalysts, unlike the impregnated ones, seem to be independent on the manganese loading as seen from Table 3. 2. The T,n~x values of the milled catalysts are all higher than that of the impregnated ones (455-500). It is of interest to note that in comparison with Mn~O4 alone, the Tm,x values of the milled catalysts shift upscale from 500 to 540 in the case of CK300 or T- A1203 and to 600 in the case of D-A1203 used as support, as shown in Table 3. This fact indicates that the increase in Tmax is contradictory to the weak interaction between Mn304 and Al~O3 on the one hand, and the peculiar effect of D-AlzO3 on the other hand. According to the different effects of the supports used, we classify the milled mixture listed in Table 3 into two groups; (i) CK300 or T-AlzO3 as support, (ii) D-A1203 as support, and analyze the possible reasons separately for the increase in Tm~x. Regarding the first group, as already indicated above, the increase in Tm~x seems to be caused by the strong milling, since no variations of Tm~ could be observed without milling and mixing only, thereby, milling seems to play a decisive role in raising the Tm~ of Mn304. The roles of milling can be suggested as follows: 1. It might lead to the formation of a spinel-like compound as mentioned above, what is called the tribo-induced solid phase reaction [ 14]. 2. It might lead to the structural change of the Mn304 in which the alumina acted as a mediator of the milling. To our great surprise, by substitution the labile alumina, i.e. the CK300 or the T-A1203 with a well-known inert material, e.g. the a-A1203 or even a quartzlite glass powder, the milling could also lead to the increase of the Tm~, from 500 to 540 in the same range of manganese loading. This obviously means the second suggestion, milling causes a structural change of the Mn304, might be true. How- ever, this merits further confirmation by other techniques as will be demonstrated later.

Wang et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 Regarding the second group, i.e. the milled Mn304-D-A1203, whose Tmax value is higher than that of pure Mn304 by 100 instead of 40 as shown in Table 3, this might imply a peculiar effect of D-AI203 rather than something induced by the milling, since the Tmax could also be raised without milling but with mixing only. This had led to the idea that during TPR or co-milling, the Mn304 might be embedded into the bulk of the D-A1203, which has a unique property to form D- A1203 encapsulated Mn304 with a certain layer thickness. The adiabatic property of the D-A1203 layer, certainly, could raise the observed Tmax well above the actual Tm~of the Mn304 (500). This will also be demonstrated later. 3.7. XRD results In order to check whether the structural change of Mn304 might be caused by milling, XRD was used to determine the bulk crystalline phase of the Mn304 present in the milled Mn3Oa-quartz, which shows the same XRD pattern (see Fig. 6b) as that of the pure Mn304 (Fig. 6a), but with smaller d-values as listed in Table 4. This situation must arise from the lattice contraction of Mn304 induced by milling, i.e., the structural change of Mn304 from metastable to the stable state. In order to explain the increased Tmavalue, we cannot exclude the likelihood of the formation of a spinel-like compound between D-A1203 and Mn304 during TPR (heating to 700) in addition to the encapsulation by D-AI203. Furthermore, if there is no reaction between D-AI203 and Mn304, so no spinel formation, the final product of the mixed Mn304-D-A1203, after TPR, must have been MnO (File No. 7-230). This has already been confirmed by our XRD studies as shown in Fig. 7b.

XPS results As expected, we found that no Mn(2p) signal at all could be detected (see Fig. 8a), when Mn304 was co-milled with D-AI203 or was pressed into the bulk of D-A1203. However, a clear Mn(2p) signal could be observed as seen in Fig. 8b, when Mn304 was mixed (not milled) with D-Ai203 and then both were gently mounted (without pressing) onto the sample holder. Obviously, the disappearance of the Mn(2p) signal can only be due to the encapsulation of Mn304 by the D- A1203 layer. In addition, the encapsulation, in our opinion, should take place spontaneously during TPR, since the Tmax could also be raised without milling as mentioned before. We have tried to confirm the aforementioned suggestion, but have not succeeded most probably because of using ex situ XPS measurements after the sample had been subjected to TPR at 210 to 450 [ below the Tm~x (500) of Mn304] and was exposed to air before XPS measurement. In other words, the encapsulation formed during TPR was broken down by air. 5000 ?OCO 7003 IC~C 00CO 46 000 60 OOC 21reta i~e~l Fig. 7, XRD patterns of TPR treated (up to 650).

DTA results It was shown by DTA that the milled Mn304-quartz did not show an exothermic peak (indication of Mn203 formation) even at 700 in its DTA profile (Fig. 9b) and still remained its original brown color after subjected to DTA up to higher than 700, indicating the increased stability due to the lattice contraction of Mn304 as shown by the XRD. In contrast with that, the mixed (without milling) Mn304- quartz had already been converted to black grey Mn203 at ca. 600 (Fig. 9a). W.

DTA profiles of (a) Mn304/quartz (25/100) by co-mixing, (b) Mn304/quartz (25/100) by co-milling. Worthy of note is the invariable Tmax (ca. 600) of Mn304 mixed with D- A1203, indicating the failure of encapsulation due to the oxidizing atmosphere. This must have been the reason for the failure of the ex situ XPS measurement. Never- theless, this proposition awaits further investigation with in situ XPS measurement. It seems reasonable to conclude that in the case of the milled Mn304-alumina (CK300 or T-A1203), the increase in Tmax by 40 as compared with the pure Mn304 is due to the lattice contraction of Mn304 induced by milling, the alumina used seems to act only as the mediator of mechanical force. On the other hand, in the unique case of D-A1203 as support, the increase in Tmax by 100 is mainly due to the encapsulation of Mn304 by the lithe D-AI203. 4. Discussion In this study, we have succeeded in dispersing Mn304 onto the surface of alumina by using manganese acetate as the appropriate precursor and incipient wetness impregnation as the effective approach. However, because of the weak interaction between manganese and alumina, the state of the dispersion of Mn304 as charac- terized by TPR was strongly effected by some factors, e.g. rate of drying, period of decomposition, and specific surface of alumina used etc. Here, we want to discuss emphatically the effect of water. We found that with the same manganese loading of say 10/100 and the same CK300 as support, by using incipient wetness impreg- nation of CK300 with manganese acetate solution, we have obtained the monolayer dispersed Mn304 having a single peak as its characteristic of TPR profile as shown in Fig. 10a. However, by using 'dry' impregnation by milling CK300 with Mn (OAc) 2\" 4H20, followed by decomposition, we have obtained a product having somewhat different characteristics in its TPR profile, i.e. a small shoulder peak appeared at ca. 400 due to the additional crystalline Mn304 as shown in Fig. 10b. Furthermore, if anhydrous 2 acetate was used instead of hydrous acetate, the product showed clearly two reduction peaks with HTRP as the major peak, and with the bulk crystalline phase as the major phase as shown in Fig. 10c. Obviously, it is the 2 Obtained from calcining Mn(OAc)z.4H20 at 130 for 12 h. 202 W. Wang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 1 i i , 1 t i t 100 300 500 700\"C Fig. 10.

[ 15 ] ). Accordingly, this seems to be the reason why the 'dry' impregnation is not suitable for preparing the monolayer dispersed Mn304 as mentioned in the beginning of Section 3. In this report, we have reported that milling could induce either lattice contraction of Mn304 or encapsulation of Mn304 by the lithe D-A1203. These phenomena, to our knowledge, have never been reported in the literature. Let us first discuss the possible explanation of the lattice contraction of Mn304. We believe, in principle, that any solid powder co-milled with Mn304 can cause the lattice to contract, in other words, to be less active, so great care must be taken to avoid a wrong evaluation of supported or promoted Mn304-1ike catalysts pre- pared by milling Mn304 with the support or promoter. Considering that Mn304, either the near-stoichiometric (MnO_ 1.33) prepared by thermal decomposition of MnH acetate (see ref. [4] ), or the non-stoichiometric (MnO > 1.33) prepared by thermal decomposition of Mnn hydroxide (see ref. [6] ), has a distorted spinel structure due to the Jahn-Teller effect [16], we wonder whether the lattice contraction that occurred is closely associated with the distorted structure of Mn304. For this reason, non-distorted C0304 (A.R. grade) co-milled with quartz powder has also been checked by TPR. The results obtained are shown in Table 5, from which one can see that the milled C0304-quartz shows the same Tmax value as that of pure Co304, whereas either the MnO_ 1.33 or the MnO> 1.33, after having been subjected to milling, have their Tmax increased by 40-50 as compared with the corresponding pure oxide. The MnO > ~.33 shows a larger increase in Tmax than the MnO~ 1.33, probably due to the former being more active as demonstrated elsewhere [4]. Seemingly, the occurrence of lattice contraction of W. Wang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 Table 5 TPR results of the oxides co-milled with quartz powder 203 Oxide Tmax of oxide Tin.~ of the mixture () () MnO_ 133 500 540 MnO> 1.33 473 528 Co304 467 468 Mn304 stems from the conversion of the metastable structure to the stable one, in other words, a mechanical treatment (i.e. milling) of the Mn304 removes the Jahn- Teller prolongation of the lattice constant, and simultaneously makes the Mn304 less active. Moreover, we should mention in passing that milling could also change the IR characteristics of Mn304 as indicated elsewhere [4]. Most probably, this could also be due to the lattice contraction of Mn304. The encapsulation by D-A1203 is an extremely interesting phenomenon. The mechanism of the formation of a D-A1203 encapsulated layer or the D-A1203 overlayer, in our opinion, is certainly different from that of the TiOx overlayer [ 17], as D-A1203 is an irreducible oxide (see also ref. [9] ). In addition, because of the unique characteristic of D-AleO3 ---e.g. other aluminas have no such effect --this effect could not be attributed to the diminution of surface free energy as in the case of V2Os/TiO2 [18]. Worthy of note is that the Tmax (TPR) of the D-A1203 supported Mn304 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation has never exceeded 500 (the Tmax of MnO~ 1.33) and the Mn(2p) signal of it likewise appeared clearly on the XPS screen. This is obviously contradictory to the above-mentioned encapsulation by D-A1203 and should be connected to the different particle size of the Mn304 formed. For example, wet impregnation should lead to the formation of very small particles of supported Mn304, which are difficult to be covered perfectly by D-A1203. To some extent, it is somewhat akin to the carbon deposit on metals [ 19]. On the other hand, intuitively, one may consider that the loss of the lithe property of D-A1203, after having been subjected to wet impregnation, might also lead to the loss of encapsulation effect. However, this awaits further deep investigation. The last point to be discussed concerns the universal validity of the encapsulation by D-A1203. It was found in this study that the formation of the encapsulation by Table 6 TPR results of D-AI203 admixed samples prepared by co-milling Solid Tm.x () of pure solid Tmax() of mixed sample Weight ratio of solid/D-Al203 MnO_ ~.33 500 600 1 / 10-1/2 MnO> 1.33 473 550 1 / 10 Co304 462 542 1 / 10 EuroPt-P 420 455 1/5 \"Used as received. 204 W. Wang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 189-206 D-A1203 could be detected by TPR as well as by XPS. The TPR profile of the D- A1203 encapsulated Mn304 possesses the following features: 1. The T, nax value increases markedly (say by 100) as compared with the pure Mn304. 2. The profile has the same appearance as that of the pure Mn304. According to the aforementioned features, it was found in our preliminary TPR tests that the formation of a D-A1203 overlayer on the surface of several oxides or even metal catalysts seems to be feasible as shown in Table 6, from which one can see clearly that the Tmax value of the solid increased markedly after being milled with D-A1203 and the TPR profile remained the same as the corresponding pure solid (not shown in the figure). The increase of the Tmax may be influenced by the thickness of the D-A1203 overlayer formed on the surface of the separate solid. For example, the lowest ATmax (455-420=35) of EuroPt-I (i.e. 6.3% Pt/SiO2) could likely be due to the thin layer of D-A1203 formed. EuroPt- 1 was reduced in flowing hydrogen at 400 for 0.5 h as reported in ref. [20]. The as-received EuroPt-1 shows two reduction peaks as seen in Fig. 1 la, in which the LTRP at ca. 125 is undoubtedly due to the reduction of reoxidized platinum particles, whereas the HTRP at ca. 420, in our opinion, is likely due to the reduction of say a composite platinum compound (instead of SiO2) which remains unreduced after hydrogen treatment at 400 as indicated above. It is remarkable that only the HTRP shifts upscale from 420 to 455 but the LTRP does not shift at all as shown in Fig. 1 lb, indicating that encapsulation by D-A1203 does not cover the platinum particle, most probably due to the very small size of the particle ( ~< 20 ,~, see refs. [20-22] ) or due to the hardness of the particle. This merits further exploration using other techniques. The catalytic behavior of the aforementioned catalysts for the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene has been measured and the interesting results have been reported elsewhere [ 23]. 125 o~ m, 455 100 300 500 'C Fig. 11.

Manganous acetate was found to be the most appropriate precursor for dispersing Mn304 onto high surface area alumina. 2. The CK300 supported Mn304 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impreg- nation includes only the monolayer dispersed Mn304 at manganese loading lower than or equal to 10/100, whereas an additional crystalline Mn304 is included concurrently with the monolayer dispersed one as the manganese load- ing is raised above 10/100. 3. Milling could induce lattice contraction of Mn304 having a distorted spinel structure and simultaneously could make Mn304 inactive in its redox behavior. 4. Encapsulation by Degussa alumina could occur on several oxides as well as Mn304, resulting in a blockage of their surface.
