The magnitude of the acceleration is highly dependent on the kind of ribonucleo- side, with the largest effect on adenosine cyclic phosphate (2300 and 440 fold accelerations at pH 7 and 8 respectively). The catalysis involves formation of a complex between the I-Zn2'1' complex and the substrate, followed by nucleophilic attack either by hydroxide ion bound to the Zn(II) ion, by free water, or by free hydroxide ion. Cleavage of ribonucleotide dimers is also catalyzed by the I-Zn^ complex. Introduction Preparation of artificial nucleases has attracted much interest, and a number of successes have been reported for the cleavage of deoxyribonucleic acids [2]. However, studies on the cleavage of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have been relatively scarce. Cleavage of RNAs by polymeric systems such as basic polypeptides [3] and enzyme-oligonucleotide hybrids [4] as well as by imidazole [5] has been shown. Cyclodextrins bearing two imidazolyl groups for the cleavage of cyclic phosphate of catechol were presented as an elegant model of enzyme ribonuclease [6]. Fission of RNAs proceeds via a different scheme from that of fission of deoxyribonucleic acids, with 2',3'-cyclic phosphates as intermediates [7]. In previous papers [8], regioselective cleavage of RNAs was achieved by use of cyclodextrins (.CyDs) as catalysts. There, both the heterocyclic bases of RNAs and the phosphate residues specifically interact with CyDs [9]. This paper reports that attachment of diethylenetriamine-metal ion complexes (accelerators for RNA cleavage [10]) to the primary hydroxyl side of the cavity of ff-CyD as substrate-binding site provides quite effective *For preliminary communication see [1] **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed 0304-5102/90/$3 50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 130 catalysts for the cleavage of ribonucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates and ribonucleotide dimers. Dependence of the catalytic activity on the kind of the heterocyclic bases in the substrates is described. Furthermore, a detailed kinetic analysis of the catalysis is presented. Experimental Materials The modified R-CyD (I) bearing a diethylenetriamine residue at the primary hydroxyl side of the cavity was prepared according to the literature [11] by the reaction of mono-6-O-tosyl-^-CyD with diethylenetriamine at 100 C for 100 min. The product was purified by chromatography using Sephadex G-15 column, and was characterized by ^NMR spectroscopy in DgO: <54.9 (7H, CiH of the ^3-CyD residue), 62.7-3.0 (10H, N CHa), 63.4-3.8 (40H, other protons of the R-CyD residue). All the NMR data were totally identical with the values in the literature [11]. The complexes between I and metal ions were prepared in situ by mixing I and the corresponding metal salts (zinc(II) hydroxide, magnesium(II) chloride, copper(II) chloride, barium(II) oxide and iron(III) chloride) in buffer solutions at the molar ratio 1.0, followed by adjustment of pH value. Formation of a stable 1:1 complex between I and metal(II) ion was confirmed previously (the formation constant of the I-Cu2\"^ complex is 10179) [11]. Kinetics The cleavage of the 2',3'-cyclic monophosphates of adenosine, guanos- ine, cytosine and uridine (IIa d) was carried out at 20 C (I = 0.01 M), with the initial concentrations of Us around 10~4 M. The reaction mixtures were periodically analyzed by HPLC; for IIa and b, Merck LiChrosorb RP-18(e) column, 25cm, 100:2 water-acetonitrile mixture (pH4.8); for lie and d, RP-18(e) column, 50cm, water (pH4.8). All the reactions satisfactorily followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rate constants without the I Zn2'1\" complex in the pH 9.0 9.5 range were evaluated from the initial rates of the appearance of the product, since the reactions were quite slow. Buffer catalysis, if any, was subtracted by extrapolation to zero buffer concentration. The cleavage of adenylyl-3',5'-adenosine (ApA), adenylyl-3',5'-cytidine (ApC), cytidylyl-3',5'-adenosine (CpA), and uridylyl-3',5'-adenosine (UpA) was effected at pH 11.0, 40 C, and was followed by HPLC under conditions similar to those described above. The equilibrium constant K^ for the dissociation of the complex involved in the catalytic reaction, as well as the maximal rate constant kmsx were determined by plotting l/(^obsd - ^un) against l/tl-Zn2\"'],). Here Aobsd and k^n are the rate constants in the presence and the absence of the I Zn^ complex. 131 Results Catalysis by the I-Zn(II) complex Table 1 shows the rate constants for the cleavage of the 2',3'-cyclic phosphates of adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and uridine (IIa d). All the cleavages are markedly accelerated by the I-Zn24\" complex. The magnitudes of the acceleration (23 and 28 fold) for the cleavages oflla and b, which have purine residues, are larger than those (3.5 and 9.6 fold) for the cleavages of He and d having pyrimidine residues. Acceleration is still more significant at the lower pH (see below). The accelerating effects of the 1-Zn2\"1\" complex were much larger than either the effects of J3-CyD without the chemical modification (3.3 and 4.9 fold for the cleavage of IIa and b) or the effects of the diethylenetriamine- Zn2-1- mixture (3.6, 8.2, 1.7 and 1.5 fold for the cleavages of IIa-d respectively) at the molar ratio 5:1. ff-CyD decelerated the cleavage of lie and d. Thus, the cooperation of the jS-CyD residue and the amine-Zn^ complex in the I-Zn2'1' complex is required for effective catalysis. The I-Zn24\" complex-catalyzed cleavage of IIa d proceeded homogene- ously. In the absence of I, however, almost none of the zinc(II) ions dissolved in the reaction media, instead forming a white precipitate. When diethyl- enetriamine equimolar to zinc(II) ion was used in place of I, considerable amounts of precipitate (zinc(II) hydroxide or zinc(II)-amine complex) formed. Homogeneous solutions were obtained only when the molar ratio of diethylenetriamine to Zn(II) ion was 5 or larger.

In the presence of the complex (0.01 M), the pseudo-first- order rate constants for the cleavage ofApA, ApC, CpA and UpA at pH 11.0 were 4.7 x 10~4, 4.8 x 10~4, 4.4 x 10~4 and 4.7 x 10~4 min~1, respectively, which were 3.4, 4.0, 1.4 and 1.3 times as large as the corresponding values in the absence of the complex. In contrast, the diethylenetriamine-Zn2'^ (5:1) mixture decelerated the cleavages of all the dimers (7, 8, 58 and 40% for ApA, ApC, CpA and UpA respectively). Complexes of I with Cu2'1\" ion and with Mg24' ion slightly accelerated the cleavage of ApA in homogeneous solutions (1.4 fold and 1.2 fold, respectively). However, mixing I with barium(II) or iron(III) at pH 11 resulted in the formation of precipitate. Kinetics of the I Zn (II) complex-catalyzed cleavage oflla The rate constant of the cleavage of IIa asymptotically increased with increasing concentration of the I-Zn24\" complex. This shows the involvement of a complex between the 1-Zn24' complex and IIa in the catalytic reaction. The Kd value of the complex was determined to be 4.9 x 10~3 M by plotting 1/^obsd-^un) against l/EI-Zn^Jo. The pH-rate constant profile for the cleavage with the I-Zn^ catalyst (0.01 M) is depicted by the open circles in Fig. 1. The profile is composed of three components, the steep region (above pH 10), the rather flat region (pH 8-10), and another steep region (below pH 8). In contrast, the rate constant of the cleavage without the complex linearly decreases with decreasing pH down to pH9.0 (the closed circles). Thus, the ratio of the rate constant with the complex to the value without it Fig. 1. pH-rate constant profiles for the cleavage of IIa in the presence (0) and the absence ( ) of the I-Zn^ complex (0.01 M) at 20 C. The solid and dotted lines are the theoretical profiles by use of the parameters in Table 2 according to eqn. 1. 133 markedly increases with decreasing pH. Detailed analysis of these profiles is described later in the Discussion section. Regioselectivity of the I-Zn(II) complex-catalyzed cleavage The product ratios (the ratios of the 3'-phosphates to the 2'-phosphates) for the 1 Zn2'1\" complex-catalyzed cleavage of IIa c were 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 respectively. These ratios are almost identical with the values (1.7, 1.5 and 1.5) for the cleavage catalyzed by the diethylenetriamine-Zn^ mixture. The regioselective catalysis by j8-CyD without any chemical modification (the selective P 0(3') cleavage) [8(b)] was not detected here. Discussion Complex formation of substrate with the I-Zn(II) complex The Kd value (4.9 x 10~3 M) of the complex between the I-Zn^ complex and IIa is about 4 times as small as the corresponding value (2.1 x lO^M) of the complex between IIa and /5-CyD without chemical modification [8b]. The larger guest-binding ability of the 1 Zn2\"1\" complex is ascribed to multiple interactions between the complex and IIa, as schematically depicted in Fig. 2. Here the interaction between the phosphate residue of IIa and the zinc(II) ion of the I-Zn24^ complex as well as the apolar interaction between the heterocyclic base of IIa and the cavity of I are cooperatively functioning. The first interaction is an electrostatic and/or coordination one. These arguments are consistent with the proposal made for the complex formation between the 1-Zn2\"1\" complex and adamantan-2-one-l-carboxylate [11]. The cleavage of lib also proceeds efficiently via a catalyst-substrate complex of a similar structure. The smaller magnitude of the acceleration by the I-Zn2\"1' complex for the cleavage of lie and d is associated with the formation of a non-productive catalyst-substrate complex, since a rather stable complex is formed here: the kinetically determined K^ value (1.2 x lO^M) of the complex between the Fig. 2. Proposed structure of the complex between the I-Zn24\" complex and IIa. 134 1-Zn2\"1' complex and lid is smaller than the value (4.9 x 10~3 M) of the complex between the I-Zn24\" complex and IIa. Probably the main driving force for the formation of the I-Zn^-IIc or -lid complex is the coordination of the pyrimidine residue of the substrate to the zinc(II) ion rather than the interaction between the pyrimidine residue with the cavity of the P-CyD residue. Thus the interaction between the zinc(II) ion and the phosphate residue is marginal, producing only a small enhancement of the reactivity of the phosphate. Without the zinc(II) ion-pyrimidine interaction, the K^ for the cleavage of He and d should be much larger than the value for the cleavage of IIa and b: pyrimidine residues are bound to the cavity of fS-CyD more weakly than purine residues [8]. The cleavage of ribonucleotide dimers catalyzed by the I-Zn^ complex also involves the formation of catalyst-substrate complex, resulting in a significant dependence of the rate of cleavage on the structure of the substrate. The cleavage of ApC is accelerated four-fold, whereas the cleavage of its sequence counterpart CpA is accelerated only by 1.4-fold. Mechanism of cleavage catalyzed by the I-Zn(II) complex The pH-rate constant profile in Fig. 1 has been analyzed by the best-fit method according to eqn. 1. Aobsd = WOH-] + k^o + k^/(K^ + [IT]) (1) The first and the second terms refer to the nucleophilic attack by hydroxide ion in solution and by water. The third term is for the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide ion bound to the zinc(II) ion. The ks are the corresponding rate constants, and Kc is the equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of the water bound to the zinc(II) ion in the I-Zn^ complex. Under the reaction conditions (lI-Zn2+]o=0.01M) the fraction of IIa complexing with the I-Zn^ complex is 0.67 (K^ = 4.9 x 10-3 M). TABLE 2 Kinetic parameters for the cleavage of IIa Parameter' I-Zn^ Complex Presence Absence *OH (min-1 M-1) *H;iO (min\"1) k^ (min\"1) ^c ^d(M) 2.6 0.9 x10-4 3.7 x10~4 10-72 4.9 x10\"3 0.9 0.0 0.0 \"lion, ^HaO \"\"d k^ are the rate constants for the nucleophilic attack by free hydroxide ion, water and the zinc(II) ion-bound hydroxide ion, respectively. K^ is the equilibrium constant for deprotonation from the water coordinated to the zinc(II) ion in the I-Zn2'1' complex, and K^ is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex between the I-Zn2'1' complex and Ua. 135 All the kinetic parameters are listed in Table 2. The kinetically determined equilibrium constant Kc (10~72) for deprotonation from the water bound to the I-Zn24^ complex is almost identical with the correspond- ing value (10~76) for the water bound to the zinc(II) ion complexing with a macrocyclic triamine ligand [12]. Without the second term in eqn. 1, the profile, especially in the pH 9-10.5 region, could not be satisfactorily reproduced, even when values of AOH said kc were widely varied. The contributions of the reactions involving the nucleophilic attack by (a) free hydroxide ion, (b) water and (c) the zincdD-bound hydroxide ion are 35, 13 and 52% at pH 10.0, and 0, 39 and 61% at pH 7.0, as estimated from the parameters in Table 2. The significance of the second and the third terms in the 1-Zn2\"1\" complex-catalyzed reaction highly contrasts with the fact that the cleavage of IIa without the complex proceeds only via nucleophilic attack by free hydroxide ion: the pH-rate constant profile for the second reaction is a straight line of slope 1.0 down to pH9.0 (the closed circles in Fig. 1). The electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom of IIa is increased by the coordination of the phosphate residue to the zinc(II) ion, and thus water can effectively function as a nucleophile. The argument is supported by the fact that the k on for the I-Zn24^ complex-catalyzed reaction is 2.8 times as large as the kon without the complex. In addition, the zinc(II) ion-bound hydroxide ion is located in a favorable position for intramolecular attack to the substrate, resulting in a promotion of the third term. The rate constant (4.0 x 10~4 min~1 at pH 8) for the I-Zn^ complex- catalyzed cleavage is 440 times as large as the value (9xl0~7 min~1) without the complex. The second value has been evaluated from the k on (0.9min~1 M~1) in Table 2, since it is too small to be directly measured. The magnitude of the acceleration by the 1-Zn2\"1\" complex is estimated to be still larger at pH 7.0 (2300 fold). In conclusion, the 1-Zn2\"1\" complex exhibits a remarkable catalysis in the cleavage of the ribonucleoside cyclic phosphates and the ribonucleotide dimers. The catalysis is especially significant near neutrality*.

        "dc:description": "The 2',3'-cyclic monophosphates of ribonucleosides are efficiently cleaved by the 1:1 complex between modified β-cyclodextrin (I) bearing a diethylenetriamine residue at the primary hydroxyl side and Zn(II) ion. The magnitude of the acceleration is highly dependent on the kind of ribonucleoside, with the largest effect on adenosine cyclic phosphate (2300 and 440 fold accelerations at pH 7 and 8 respectively). The catalysis involves formation of a complex between the I-Zn2+ complex and the substrate, followed by nucleophilic attack either by hydroxide ion bound to the Zn(II) ion, by free water, or by free hydroxide ion. Cleavage of ribonucleotide dimers is also catalyzed by the I-Zn2+ complex.",
