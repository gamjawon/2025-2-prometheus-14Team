Italy Received 28 November 1994; revised 8 December 1995; accepted 8 December 1995 Abstract Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has been studied at 5 103 Pa, at 508 K, an H 2/C0 = 2/1 molar ratio on Ru/T-A1203 catalysts (1% Ru wt./wt.), using Ru(AcAc)3 (AcAc standing for acetylacetonate), RuC13 and K(AcAc) as precursors; K/Ru and C1/Ru molar ratios ranged from 0.14 to 2.18 and from 1.31 to 3.71, respectively. As Ru catalysts for FTS undergo easy alteration resulting from coke deposition, the results from kinetic runs were collected using both fresh catalysts (at 5-10 min time-on-stream) and also when steady state conditions were reached (about 150 min time-on-stream). The influence of K/Ru and CI/Ru ratios on CO conversion and on the selectivity of the formation of different products in the reaction has been examined. Changes in activity, during the regeneration procedures of the catalysts, differ significantly when the precursor is Ru(AcAc)3 (increase in activity after regeneration cycle) or RuCI3 (significant deactivation with a decrease in Ru surface concentration, as determined by XPS).

Introduction Effects of electropositive and electronegative modifiers in FTS catalysts may be studied by means of a theoretical approach [ 1 ]. However, these methods are only applicable to models, reflecting the most relevant aspects of promotion [2]. Studies on 'near-to-ideal-model', such as well-defined single crystal surfaces, have provided the link between theories and physical phenomena. Indeed recent * Corresponding author. Tel.

Ragaini et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 17-29 surface science studies have greatly improved the understanding of promotion mechanisms, combining UHV and high-pressure reactor systems [3]. Although, significant agreement between bulk, single crystal and supported metals has been pointed out for some specific systems [4-6], presence of a support, e.g. SiO2 or AI203 generally brings ambiguities about migration or adsorption of molecular species onto support materials. Therefore, any specula- tive effort in understanding promoting effects on real FTS catalysts should follow strict experimental procedures. Recent papers [7,8] have been presented by Goodwin et al. dealing with the investigation of promoting effects on silica-supported Ru catalysts. However, few studies have been reported on alumina-supported Ru catalysts doped with K+ and C1- ions. In the course of this research work we have investigated the effects of the presence of modifiers such as C1- and K+ ions in ruthenium based catalysts supported on y-AI203 utilized in FTS. Catalysts testing was performed carefully considering the nature of catalysts where the influence of modifiers is mentioned. Indeed it is important to stress the necessity to: (i) utilize uniform catalyst batches; (ii) keep reaction conditions strictly controlled and similar, since it is well-known that the surface of FTS-catalysts changes during successive tests [9-11]. Therefore it is very difficult to compare the results based on the influences of additives (e.g. K+, C1-) if the fresh catalysts have not undergone the same experimental conditions. The experiments were carried out in order to obtain a better understanding of the system. Therefore, fresh catalysts containing different quantities of either potassium or chlorine were prepared and tested. Thus fruitful research in this field would permit the rationalization of really catalytic systems, ultimately yielding greater control of reactivity towards the desired products. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterization of catalysts The catalysts were prepared using the classical incipient-wetness imbibition procedure which was performed under vacuum. The support (y-A1203 AKZO E-C Grade, surface area (BET) 159 m2/g, pore volume 0.45 cm3/g) is outgassed by heating (2 h, 473 K) under vacuum (10 Pa) to eliminate humidity and adsorbed gases or blind pores content. Subsequently, a solution is gently poured on the support, to wet it uniformly in a static vacuum, at 273 K. In this way the liquid immediately penetrates into each pore and diffusion problems are eliminated, as the metal no longer diffuses from outside into the pores but is instead cast inside the pores.

Outgassing was followed by impregnation under vacuum. The sample was then dried in air at 360 K in order to eliminate solvent. This was then followed by reduction for 5 h under flow of hydrogen (60 Nml/min) at 623 K. The samples which contained chlorine were prepared from the precursors Ru(AcAc)3 and RuC13 whereas the sample which contained potassium were prepared from Ru(AcAc)3 and K(AcAc). Different samples were prepared by varying the ratio of the precursors. Details of prepared catalyst samples are given in Table 1. ~y-A1203, AKZO grade E-C was used as a support for all of the samples as it has a very low iron content (an active metal in FTS). Potassium concentration values were obtained using a Perkin Elmer 2380 spectrophotometer, by atomic emission after hydrochloric acid dissolution of the samples. These results were then verified using ionic chromatography analysis (Dionex DX 100 column CS10 conductive detector). Ionic chromatography analysis (Dionex DX100 column AS 4A-SC) was used to analyze the chlorine concentrations, by dissolving the catalysts in a weak alkaline solution and stirring slowly for 1 h at room temperature. The metal dispersion (DM, defined as the ratio between the titrated surface metal atoms and the total metal atoms of the sample) of catalyst samples was determined using a particular technique of hydrogen chemisorption [12,13]. Dried catalyst samples (evacuation at 10 3 Torr at 393 K for l h) were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 663 K for 3 h (heating rate 5-10 K, 60 N cm) s-~ g- l, where g is the metal weight) and then evacuated in a high vacuum (ca. 10- 6 Torr) at the reduction temperature for 16 h. Chemisorption measurements were carried out by single introduction procedure (SI), with an equilibration time of 3 h. Adsorption temperatures were 338 K for K-modified samples and 20 V. Ragaini et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 17-29 373 K for Cl-modified ones [14]. Back-sorption (BS) was carried out by pumping the catalyst sample for 0.5 h at a pressure of ca. 10 6 TOIT followed by a subsequent chemisorption cycle. The amount of irreversibly chemisorbed hydrogen, ni= (mol), was calculated from the difference between the total adsorbed hydrogen in the two cycles (SI, BS). DM is calculated using the equation DM = SFm'nirr/nv, where SFm is the stoichiometric factor (mol of surface metal per mol of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen); in this case SFm = 2, and nx is the total number of moles of adsorbing metal. DM data for all catalyst samples are reported in Table 1. These measurements allowed us to obtain the trend of CO turnover number, TN(CO), of the series of catalysts which contained the different modifiers (TN(CO) has been calculated from the equa- tion: TN = SV CcoDM where Cco is the CO conversion and SV = 9 10 2 mol CO/(mol tot. Ru. s)). The formation of coke deposition was investigated by using XPS analysis (M-probe, Surface Science Instruments, SSI) and also by measuring the surface area (BET). The research done by XPS on a fresh D sample and on the same sample after undergoing three catalytic tests illustrated a decrease in metal surface concentration from 0.83% to 0.47%, and an increase in carbon content from 0% to 12% (atom/atom). BET analyses performed on both fresh and exhausted samples show a decrease in surface area during the course of the kinetics from 159 mZ/g to 135 mZ/g, respectively. For sample A, the surface area of both fresh and exhausted catalysts (BET), were practically identical. Hence the possibility of the blocking of pores was excluded. From XPS spectra an increase in the surface area of ruthenium was observed after the reaction. The amount of ruthenium in a fresh sample was 2.72% whilst it was 4.1% in an exhausted sample which had undergone three kinetic tests. 2.2. Apparatus for kinetic runs The kinetic runs were performed in a stainless-steel continuous feed tubular reactor having a co-axial internal copper tube, thus preventing the formation of carbonyl compounds (reactor volume 8.5 ml, length 220 mm, internal diameter 7 mm). The experimental apparatus withstands reaction pressures up to 35-105 Pa and the working pressure was maintained using a pneumatic needle valve controlled by an electronic pressure regulator. A schematic diagram of the plant is given in Fig. 1. To be able to analyze gas compounds with those condensable at room temperature the line exiting the reactor was kept at 543 K, which was on line with a gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector. The exit mixture from the reactor was analyzed at desirable time intervals in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a wide bore Poraplot Q V.

In our experimental conditions, as usual in FTS, coke deposition happens in the initial step of the reaction. This will be discussed further in Section 3.2. Therefore the mass balance applied to CO, as indicated above is only applicable in steady state conditions.

All samples used were characterized by XPS. 3.

Analogous results are reported in Table 3 as a function of C1/Ru molar ratio. Other results are also reported in graphical form: Fig. 2 for TN(CO) for K-doped samples and Fig. 3 for TN(CO) for Cl-doped catalysts.

The results were collected for both initial and steady state conditions, i.e. 150 rain after the start of the experiment. 3.1. Potassium effect By increasing the quantity of potassium in the catalytic system we observed a significant decrease in CO conversion for both steady state and initial periods (see Table 2), consistent with the decrease in TN(CO) (see Fig. 2). Since the metal dispersion, DM, for sample A and samples E ~ L are quite similar (see Table 1) our experimental results suggest that potassium shows a poisoning effect on metal active centers. Assuming that high potassium loading corresponds to high metal coverage (overlooking the nature of support acidity), the poisoning effect seems to be much more relevant at high metal coverage. Indeed recent surface science studies on Ru single crystal pointed out that potassium modifying effects depend strongly on metal coverage [3]. Similar phenomena have been evidenced for alkali promotion effect on classical iron catalytic systems [15,16]. An optimum K/Fe ratio range of 0.015 to 0.05 (mol/mol) has been reported for conventional fused iron [17] and Fe-K/AI203 26 V. Ragaini et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 17-29 [18] catalysts. Both catalysts showed a decrease on catalytic activity at a higher K/Fe ratio. Although data reported in Table 2 show a slight increase in the value of a parameter at low K/Ru ratio, a maximum value of catalytic activity was not found for our samples (Fig. 2). The reason being: (i) relatively high K loading was used in catalyst preparation; (ii) catalytic tests were performed at different experimental conditions from those of cited references. Concerning the selectivity to other reaction products it is important to stress that at high potassium loading (high K/Ru), the olefin/paraffin ratio (calcu- lated as [C22-+ C~-]/[C2 q- C3]) and CO2 selectivity, increases while methane selectivity decreases. These experimental results suggest that modification of Ru/T-A1203 by treatment with K(AcAc) significantly lowers the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst, leading to the formation of a product with a high C/H ratio. A similar trend has also been found on iron powder catalyst samples [10,19]. 3.2. Chlorine effect, coke deposition and catalyst deactivation The source of chlorine in the catalysts is RuC13, thus chlorine is present in our catalysts as a negative ion. Lu and Tatarchuk [14] have discussed the structure of Ru/A1203 catalysts similar to those employed here. In particular these authors have proposed a picture of the sites on which chlorine ions are situated; they suggest that the observed inhibition of hydrogen chemisorption is due to relatively short range electronic modifications attributable to electronega- tive chlorine adatoms. Similar results have been found by Narita et al. [20,21]. Such authors have found that the residual chlorine ions on the surface of Ru/A1203 prepared from RuC13 (after reduction in a flow of hydrogen at 600 K) are partitioned between the support and the metal. Thus chlorine inhibits both CO and hydrogen chemisorption. The results presented in the present paper show that the influence of chlorine ions on catalysts is important for the regeneration (Fig. 4a) and also for CO hydrogenation activity (Fig. 3). In this case a significant reduction of CO conversion has been observed in steady state conditions as a function of C1/Ru ratio (about 20%, as C1/Ru ratio changes from zero to 3.8 mol/mol). These results are very similar to those obtained on a Ru/SiO2 catalyst by Goodwin et al. [7,8]. For the first item (regeneration) comparison of Fig. 4a (sample D) with Fig. 4b (sample A) shows that chlorine ions are, more than likely, the reason for the failure in regenerating catalyst D. Carbon deposition on chlorinated noble metal catalysts is a common problem in reforming reactions [22-26], in particular on Ru catalysts [27-33], because ruthenium is known to break carbon-carbon bonds also at very low temperatures [27,29]. Therefore, we can easily understand the presence of unreactive carbon species during Fischer- Tropsch synthesis or CO hydrogenation [25,28-33,35-37]. Such species have V. Ragaini et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 17-29 27 also been found on Pd/AI203 during adsorption of hydrocarbons even at very low temperatures (293-473 K) [34]. Different types of carbon have been found by some authors: two types according to Bell [28] and Goodman [35], four types according to Mc Carty and Wise [38]. In Bell's paper the difference between C,, and Ct3 species is that the latter are less reactive and are resident partially on the support and partially on the surface ruthenium atoms. According to Bell et al. [28] this situation is responsible for loss in the activity of FTS catalyst. In Goodman's paper [35] it was found that the transition from active carbon (carbidic) to inactive carbon (graphitic) in CO hydrogenation on Ni(100) occurs at 650 K. It is possible that on Ru/AI203 such transitions can occur at lower temperatures due to the peculiarity of Ru in breaking carbon-carbon bonds. For catalyst D, our experimental results (see experimental paragraph) show a reduction in BET surface area and surface ruthenium concentration. Thus the increase is carbon deposits for used catalysts confirm the afore-mentioned picture of deactivation. In this catalyst, it is evident from the results, that occlusion of the pores, probably took place in the micropore region resulting from carbonaceous species deposition. The final effect is that a decrease in catalytic activity, as part of the catalytic metal is not able to participate in the reaction, since it has been blocked in the occluded pores. In catalyst A, as shown in the experimental section, no change in BET surface was observed in either fresh or aged catalysts. Instead an increase in surface ruthenium concentration was observed. This phenomenon is new with regard to the referenced papers on this topic and may explain the increase in CO conversion from fresh to regenerated A catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. Goodwin et al. [7,8] when discussing the negative influence of chlorine ions on FTS for Ru/SiO2 catalysts, prepared from Ru(NO)(NO3)3 and then Cl-doped by treatment with diluted HC1, ruled out the influence of inactive carbon on the surface. The reason is that the deactivation of the same catalyst has been observed under ammonia synthesis, i.e. in the absence of a carbon source. Instead it was hypothesized 'that a modifier such as C1 may be able to induce new inactive metal surface structure during the oxidation/reduction cycle'. This hypothesis may be possible since such catalysts have been prepared using SiO2 instead of AI203 and precursors which did not contain chlorine. The difference between SiO2 and A1203 supported platinum during chlorine treatment has been discussed by Foger and Jaeger [36] and the results can justify the afore-men- tioned difference between Ru/SiO2 and Ru/A1203 catalysts. On the other hand Fig. 4a shows that for catalyst D deactivation is progres- sive. Presumably, the catalyst forms a non-regenerable species of carbon. Another explanation of the results reported in Fig. 4a may be due to inhibition of both hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption provided by chlorine ions. This phenomenon has been observed by Narita et al. [21] and by Lu and Tatarchuk [14] on catalysts very similar to those prepared in this paper (i.e. Ru/A1203 from RuC13). Also the selectivity to CO2 for the catalysts 28 V. Ragaini et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General I39 (1996) 17-29 prepared from RuC13 (Fig. 5a) and from Ru(AcAc)3 (Fig. 5b) can also be explained in the same way. It is well known that CO2 is formed mainly from two reactions: CO(g) ~ (CO)ads (1) 2(CO)ads ~ Cs + CO2(g) (2) Reaction (2) is the well-known Boudouard's reaction. An excess of surface carbon Cs reduces the formation of CO2. This happens with fresh catalysts D (Fig. 5a) and A (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the adsorption of CO (reaction 1) is slower in the presence of chlorine ions [21]. Therefore, we observe a maximum in the upper curve of Fig. 5a at approximately 100 min of reaction time. As reported for nickel catalysts equilibrium for reaction (2) is reached at 500 K in approxi- mately 60 min [37]. After a stable concentration of C~ has been reached the average selectivity of CO2 does not change after regenerating cycles. This is irrespective of the ruthenium precursor, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. 4. Conclusion The results show that on Ru/A1203 catalysts both potassium and chlorine, as ions, decrease CO conversion. This effect is more prevalent for potassium where a dramatic decrease in conversion is observed. For both dopant ions in the range 0-2.18 for K/Ru (mol/mol) and 0-3.71 for C1/Ru (mol/mol) no maximum in CO conversion has been observed. While chlorine ions have very small influence on the C2 + C3 olefin/paraffin ratio, potassium ions significantly increase this ratio, especially at steady state conditions. The regenerability of Cl-doped catalysts is greatly hindered by the presence of irreversible carbon and/or hydrocarbon depositions, resulting in a reduction in surface area and ruthenium surface concentration, as detected by XPS and BET surface analyses. Chain propagation mechanisms do not seem to be favoured by a high level of potassium ions and are not influenced at all by the presence of chlorine ions.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has been studied at 5 · 103 Pa, at 508 K, an H2/CO=2/1 molar ratio on Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (1% Ru wt./wt.), using Ru(AcAc)3 (AcAc standing for acetylacetonate), RuCl3 and K(AcAc) as precursors; K/Ru and Cl/Ru molar ratios ranged from 0.14 to 2.18 and from 1.31 to 3.71, respectively. As Ru catalysts for FTS undergo easy alteration resulting from coke deposition, the results from kinetic runs were collected using both fresh catalysts (at 5–10 min time-on-stream) and also when steady state conditions were reached (about 150 min time-on-stream). The influence of K/Ru and Cl/Ru ratios on CO conversion and on the selectivity of the formation of different products in the reaction has been examined. Changes in activity, during the regeneration procedures of the catalysts, differ significantly when the precursor is Ru(AcAc)3 (increase in activity after regeneration cycle) or RuCl3 (significant deactivation with a decrease in Ru surface concentration, as determined by XPS).
