When the amount of rhenia was increased, both isomerization and metathesis activity increased in a similar manner. Over a wide range of reaction temperatures ( -35 C to 60 C), activation temperatures (50 C to 500 C) and reduction temperatures (100 C to 500 C), isomerization occurred very readily and seemed to reach equilibrium. In contrast, the metathesis activity was greatly affected by the reaction conditions: it was very low at reaction temperatures lower than 0 C and at activation temperatures lower than 150 C, and was destroyed at reduction temperatures higher than 200 C. This indicates that the active sites of double-bond isomerization are not necessarily directly associated with those for metathesis. As skeletal isomerization and polymerization did not occur, the acid strength is probably fairly weak. The active sites for the double-bond isomerization are thought to be both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, but Bronsted acidity is more important than Lewis acidity for isomerization. Introduction The Re20,-Al203 catalyst is well known for its high activity and selectivity in the metathesis of a variety of olefins. We have shown, for example, that a CsN03-Re20,,- A1203 catalyst is very active for the metathesis of various kinds of alkenes, such as n-alkenes [ 1, 2], a,ca-dienes [3, 4] and 1,4-alkadienes [4-6], with a metathesis selectivity of >94% without double-bond shift isomerization or polymerization. The catalytic metathesis of methyl-1-alkenes showed homometathesis with high selectivity, except for 2-methyl-l-hexene (2-Me-1-C6) [7]. Alkylsubstituted vinylenes have exhibited anomalous reaction behavior, without exception, using a CsN03-Re,07-AI,O, catalyst [8]. Here, the catalyst promoted migration of the double bond to the resulting isomer and subsequent co-metathesis [8]. However, neither homometathesis nor rearrangement of the carbon skeleton occurred. The metathesis of methyl-substituted vinylenes has received relatively little attention. Doyle reported that 3-Me-2-C6 is homometathesized over (nBu)QN[Mo(CO)6Cl] ---MeAIC12 [9], while a West German patent described 0304-5102/92/$5.00 (0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 250 the homometathesis of 2-Me-1-C4 over WO(OPh)4-AIC13-Et3Al [10]. An intermediate in the synthesis of musk perfume, 3,3-dimethyl-l-butene (3,3DMe-1-C4) is obtained by co-metathesis of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene (2,4,4TMe-2-C5) with ethylene over a W03-Si02-MgO catalyst [11]. 2,5DMe-2,4-hexadiene is homometathesized over Re20,-A1203-SnMe4 with high selectivity [12]. However, there are no reports of the isomerization of reactants in the literature. Studies on the isomerization of double bonds using metathesis catalysts are limited. Most studies are for 1-C4 [13-16] and 2-C4 [16-18] using Re207-A1203 [14, 15], Re207_S'O2 [14], M003-A1203 [15, 17, 18], W03A1203 [15] and W03-Si02 [13, 16] in the vapor phase. Although not employing metathesis catalysts, the vapor-phase isomerization of 2-Me-1C4 with CU-S'02 [19] and 2-Me-1-C5, 3-Me-1-C5 and 1-C6 with various oxide catalysts [20, 21] have been reported. As mentioned above, the study of the isomerization of alkenes with alkyl-substituted vinyl groups using metathesis catalysts has been reported only in our papers [7, 8]. Experiments in this laboratory have shown that alkenes with alkyl-substituted vinyl groups, such as 2-Me-1C4, 2-Me-1-C5, 2-Me-1-C6, 2-Me-2-C5, 2-Me-2-C6, 2-Et-1-C6 and 3-Me-2-C5, undergo rapid double-bond isomerization to the more highly substituted olefins, and subsequent co-metathesis with the starting material using a CsN03-Re2O7-A1,03 catalyst [7, 8]. The double-bond isomerization of isoalkenes was 5-10 times faster than that of other alkyl-substituted vinylenes. The aim of this work is to clarify the active sites of double-bond migration on Re207-A1203 catalysts for olefin metathesis. For this purpose, the effects of reaction temperature, activation temperature, amount of rhenia on 7-A1203 and reduction temperature were investigated in detail, mainly using 2-Me-1-C6 as the starting material. Experimental Catalyst Four kinds of Rez 07 -A12 03 catalysts (40-60 mesh) were prepared by impregnation, as described in previous papers [1, 3]. The amount of Re207 was determined, after calcination at 550 C, to be 4.6, 9.5, 13.4 and 17.4 wt. %, respectively, by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Re207-Al203 catalysts modified with alkali hydroxide (NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH) or CsN03 were also prepared by impregnating 17.4 wt.% Re207-A1203 catalyst with the relevant aqueous solution. After drying at 110 C for 24 h, the modified catalysts were calcined at 500 C for 2 h under oxygen flow. The amount of alkali metal was calculated to be 7.52 x 10-5 mol (g cat)-', approximating to 1 wt.% as metal ion, for each. Si02-A1203, obtained from Catalysts and Chemicals Industries (IS-28, A1203 29.07%, Na20 0.01%, S04 0.28%, 420 m2 g-1), was milled and sieved, and 40-60 mesh was used. 251 Reagents Chlorobenzene, used as the solvent, and toluene and o-xylene, used as internal standards, were purified by rectification over P205. 2-Me-1-Cs was obtained from Aldrich, 2-Me-1-C4 was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries and 2-Me-1-C5 and 1-C7 were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo. All reactants were dried over 5A molecular sieves, but used without further purification, since GC analysis confirmed a purity of > 99% for each. Procedure The reactions were carried out in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure in a single-path, continuous-flow tubular Pyrex glass reactor with a fixed catalyst bed. The detailed experimental procedure and the analysis of the reaction products were practically the same as previously described [8]. The data obtained were analyzed using the following definitions: 2-/1- = I/R = [2-Me-2-C6] /[2-Me-1-C6] where 2-/1- indicates the isomer ratio, taken to be the amount of isomer remaining (1) relative to the amount of starting material remaining (R). This equation illustrates the case of the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6. conversion = [1 - (1 + R)/A] x 100 where A is the number of moles of reactant used. selectivity = 2 x Ni x 100/(A -1 - R) where Ni is the number of moles of a reaction product (i) produced. ISO(%) = (I + C + H + D) x 100/A where ISO is the degree of isomerization. C is the number of moles of co-metathesis products formed, H the number of moles of homometathesis products of the isomer formed, and D the number of moles of byproducts formed. meta.(%) = (C6 + C6 + 2 x C9 + 2 x Cio) x 100/A where 'meta.' means the degree of metathesis reaction. The above equation illustrates the case of the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6. The mass balance was > 97% for each. Results and discussion Effect of the amount of rhenia on alumina The effect of the amount of rhenia on alumina was investigated. First, four kinds of catalysts with various amounts of rhenia were applied to 1-C7 as a representative n-alkene at reaction conditions of 40 C and 252 W/F = 4.6 (g cat) h mol-1. When the amount of rhenia was increased, the metathesis reaction increased by 14.3% for 4.6 wt.% Re207, 36.3% for 9.5 wt.% Re20, and up to 39.4% for 17.4 wt.% Re207. The reaction product was 6-dodecene by homometathesis, with > 94% selectivity irrespective of the amount of rhenia. The degree of isomerization was less than 1.8%, showing that the double-bond isomerization of 1-C'7 to 2-C7 is very limited. Figures 1 and 2 show the results obtained for 2-Me-1-C6. The changes in the activity for the metathesis of 2-Me-1-C6' with various amounts of rhenia show similar tendencies to those for 1-C7 and to those reported for various kinds of olefins [22-26].

Reaction routes of reaction products in metathesis of 2-methyl-l-hexene. reaction pathways leading to the metathesis products in the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6. The major reaction products were 5-Me-4-C9 (Cio) and 2-Me-1C3 (C4) by co-metathesis, but the other co-metathesis products, 1-C5 (C5) and 2,3-DMe-2-C7 (C9), were not detected. GC-MS analysis showed that there were small amounts of C,1H22 (Ci1), C13H2s (Ci3) and C14H2$ (Ci4) at higher rhenia contents, but their structures and the reaction pathways have not yet been confirmed. The homometathesis product, 5,6-DMe-5-Cio (Ci2), the rearrangement of the carbon skeleton and the isomerization to 2-Me-3-C6 were not detected under the reaction conditions. The amount of isomerization of 2-Me-1-C6 to 2-Me-2-C6 increased when the amount of rhenia was increased to 15 wt.%, and reached an almost constant value above 15 wt.%, as shown in Fig. 1. The shape of the curve for the degree of isomerization was similar to that for the metathesis activity, and this seemed to suggest that the active sites were the same. However, this presumed relationship between metathesis and isomerization activity was found to be misleading, as will be described below. Most of the 2-Me-2-C6 produced by the isomerization of 2-Me-1-C6 was consumed by co-metathesis below 10 wt.% Re207 loading, but the 2-/1- ratios were > 10 above 15 wt.% Re207 loading, showing that unreacted 2-Me-2-C6 remained largely in the reaction mixtures. This induced the homometathesis of 2-Me-2-C6, producing 2,3-DMe-2-C4 (C6) and 4-C8 (C$). The relatively small extent of homometathesis of 2-Me-2-Cs, in spite of the abundance of 2-Me-2-C6 at higher rhenia levels, is thought to reflect the- steric hindrance encountered when the metallacyclobutane intermediates are formed. This shows that isomerization occurs much faster than cometathesis at higher loadings of rhenia. 254 Similar results were obtained for 2-Me-1-C5 and 2-Me-1-C4, although the absolute product ratios were somewhat different. Reaction temperature The effect of the reaction temperature was investigated for the 17.4% Re207-A1203 catalyst. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the conversion and metathesis activities were dependent on the reaction temperature at low temperatures, but metathesis activities became independent of the reaction temperature above 40 C.

The degree of isomerization was independent of the reaction temperature, suggesting that the isomerization was very fast and reached equilibrium even at temperatures as low as -40 C. The activity changes in metathesis and isomerization differed greatly. This suggests that the active sites for double-bond isomerization are not necessarily directly associated with those for metathesis. Ci, was the main reaction product at lower temperatures, but its selectivity decreased with increasing reaction temperature. On the other hand, the selectivity toward co-rnetathesis increased up to a reaction temperature of 20 C and then decreased above 20 C. The amounts of C6 and C$, homometathesis products of the isomer, and Ci1 increased gradually with increasing reaction temperature. Reduction temperature After the normal activation treatment under nitrogen flow at 500 C for 1.5 h, the catalyst was cooled to reduction temperatures under nitrogen flow and subsequently regenerated under hydrogen flow for 1 h. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled to the reaction temperature under nitrogen flow. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the metathesis activity and conversion decreased drastically with increasing reduction temperature and the active sites for metathesis were completely destroyed above 200 C. In contrast, the isomerization activity and 2-/1- ratios behaved differently than the metathesis activity, and were independent of the reduction temperature. At higher reduction temperatures, the main reaction product was Ci4. zoo - ISO ss0 0 0 .___ .. ~,_ 2 0 N 15 60 _~~ ~ _ Z7~T U 14 1a H a3 40 N z 20 Mete. Conv.

It has been reported that Re(VII) exists below 150 C, Re(VI) between 50 to 350 C, Re(IV) above 100 C and Re(0) above a 450 C reduction temperature [14]. The active valence of Re for metathesis has been reported to be Re(VII), and this agrees with the results obtained in this work. According to a report by Edreva-Kardjieva and Andreev [14], the active species in the isomerization of 1-C4 to 2-C4 is Re(IV). However, the degree of isomerization was independent of the valence state of Re and isomerization occurred even below the reduction temperature of 100 C, and under this condition Re(IV) does not exist. The differences in the behaviors toward metathesis and isomerization suggest that the active sites differ from each other. 2-Me-1-C5 and 2-Me-1-C4 showed similar reaction behaviors to 2-Me-1C6 under the same reaction conditions, although the absolute product ratios were somewhat different. Activation temperature It has been suggested that double-bond isomerization occurs on acid sites. The adsorbed water on solid catalysts influences the nature of the catalysts, and the acid properties in particular. The 17.4 wt.% Rez07 A1203 catalyst was activated at various temperatures under nitrogen flow for 1.5 h in order to control the concentration of surface hydroxyls. The results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The metathesis activity increased greatly up to an activation temperature of 200 C, and reached an almost constant value above 300 C. In contrast, the degree of isomerization and the 2-/1- ratio were almost independent of the activation temperature, and seemed to reach equilibrium values. This shows that the adsorbed water poisons the active sites for metathesis, but does not poison those for 257 100 80 60 O 40 ISO Conv.

The different behaviors in isomerization and metathesis suggest that their active sites differ from each other. The product distributions changed greatly between 100 C and 250 C. At temperatures lower than 150 C, the main product was Ci4 and metathesis products were few. On the other hand, the product distribu tions were completely reversed at temperatures higher than 300 300'C. The adsorbed water is helpful in the formation of Ci4 and harmful to metathe sis. The main active species in C,4 formation is thought to have BrOnsted acidity. 258 2-Me-1-C5 showed quite similar reaction behavior to 2-Me-1-C6 under the same reaction conditions, although the absolute values were somewhat different. The effect of activation temperature on the metathesis of 1-C? was also investigated, in order to make a comparison with the behavior of 2-Me-1-C6. The metathesis activity increased greatly, showing a tendency similar to that of 2-Me-1-C', and homometathesis occurred predominantly at temperatures higher than 300 C. The isomerization of 1-C? to 2-C7 and the subsequent co-metathesis to produce 5-Cij, 1-C6 and 2-C' occurred mostly at activation temperatures lower than 200 C, although the conversion was less than 14%. The degree of isomerization and the 2-/1- ratio were less than 4% and 1, respectively, and these values were extremely low compared with those for 2-Me-1-C6. Active sites of isomerazation The values of the degree of isomerization and the 2-/1- ratio for the 17.4 wt.% Rez07-A1203 catalyst were ca. 80% and ca. 13, respectively, over a wide range of reaction temperatures (Fig. 3), reduction temperatures (Fig. 5) and activation temperatures (Fig. 7). These data show that the isomerization occurs very easily and reaches equilibrium. It has been reported that Re207---A1,03 catalysts have both Lewis and Bronsted acidity [26, 27]. The isomerization increased when the amount of rhenia was increased, as shown in Fig. 1, and this must be associated with the increase in both Bronsted and Lewis acidity with increasing rhenia loading of Re207-A1203, as reported by Xu Xiaoding et al. [26]. Reactions over modified Re207-A1203 catalysts with alkaline hydroxides or CsNO3 were carried out, and the results are shown in Table 1. Compared with the 17.4 wt.% Re207-A1203 catalyst, over the modified catalysts the 2-/1- ratio decreased greatly, from 13 to about 1, and the degree of isomerization also TABLE 1 Effect of addition of alkaline salt to 17.4 wt.% Re20,-Ai203 Alkali Conv. 2-/1- ISO Meta.

There were no large differences between the results obtained using the various metal ions as modifiers, but CsN03 appeared to be the most effective salt for depressing the isomerization activity and for improving the metathesis selectivity. As the degree of isomerization and the 2-/1- ratio were lowered by the addition of a small amount of alkaline salt, it is clear that alkali poisoned active sites for isomerization, probably Bronsted acid sites. However, isomerization occurs at a fairly high percentage (about 50%) for alkali-treated catalysts. This must be the result of the 'isomerization activity caused by rhenia as a Lewis acid. These findings suggest that Bronsted acid sites have a greater isomerization activity than Lewis acid sites. In order to clarify this point, reactions were run using y-A1203, Si02-A1203 and 10 wt.% Re, 0,-S'02-A'203 as catalysts. The results are summarized in Table 2 together with other data. y-A1203, which shows mostly Lewis acidity and has a few weak Bronsted acid sites, did not give any products, but had isomerization activity. S'02-A1203, which has strong Bronsted acid sites, showed very high activity toward isomerization and Ci4 formation even under the milder reaction conditions, such as low temperature ( -28 C) and low contact time (0.6 (g cat) h mol-1). With the addition of 10 wt.% Re207 to the Si02-A1203, the isomerization activity was depressed and metathesis activity appeared, but the catalyst had much higher isomerization activity than the 10 wt.% Re207-A1203 catalyst. This may be caused by Bronsted acidity on the surface of S'02-A'203 not covered with rhenia [25]. Double-bond isomerization and Ci4 formation occurred over the 17.4% Re207-A1203 catalyst reduced even at temperatures higher than 100 C, although the activities were lower, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.

Migration of the double bond undoubtedly occurs on both Bronsted and Lewis acids. The isomerization activity of Bronsted acid sites is greater than that of Lewis acid sites. As the skeletal isomerization and polymerization did not occur over Re207-A1203 catalysts, the acid strength must be fairly weak. Various mechanisms of double-bond isomerization have been reported in the literature [ 16, 19-21, 28]. Lewis acid sites, Bronsted acid sites, Lewis acid-Lewis base site pairs and Bronsted acid-Lewis base site pairs are proposed to be active sites of the isomerization. While the above mechanisms are compatible with our data, further studies are needed to reveal the detailed mechanisms and the nature of the active sites of double-bond isomerization over Re207-A1zO3 catalysts. Conclusions Reactions of 2-methyl-l-alkenes were carried out over selective Re207-A12O3 metathesis catalysts. However, homometathesis did not occur at all, while the double-bond isomerization to 2-methyl-2-alkene occurred readily. The selectivities toward the reaction products (2-methyl-2-alkenes, co-metathesis products between the starting material and the resulting isomer, and unknown C14 compounds) varied greatly with the rhenia loading and the activation and reduction conditions. Metathesis activity was lower over catalysts reduced with hydrogen above 100 C or treated at activation temperatures lower than 200 C. Double-bond shift isomerization of 2-Me-l-alkene to 2-Me-2-alkene was very facile. The active sites of isomerization differed from those of metathesis. Both Lewis and Bronsted acids are active sites for the isomerization and Ci4 formation, but Bronsted acidity is more important than Lewis acidity for these reactions. Ci4 is produced selectively over catalysts having Bronsted acidity and over Re207-AI,O, catalyst reduced at temperatures higher than 200 C. References 1 T. Kawai, Y. Yamazaki and A.

When the amount of rhenia was increased, both isomerization and metathesis activity increased in a similar manner. Over a wide range of reaction temperatures ( −35 °C to 60 °C), activation temperatures (50 °C to 500 °C) and reduction temperatures (100 °C to 500 °C), isomerization occurred very readily and seemed to reach equilibrium. In contrast, the metathesis activity was greatly affected by the reaction conditions: it was very low at reaction temperatures lower than 0 °C and at activation temperatures lower than 150 °C, and was destroyed at reduction temperatures higher than 200 °C. This indicates that the active sites of double-bond isomerization are not necessarily directly associated with those for metathesis. As skeletal isomerization and polymerization did not occur, the acid strength is probably fairly weak. The active sites for the double-bond isomerization are thought to be both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, but Brønsted acidity is more important than Lewis acidity for isomerization. References 1 T.
