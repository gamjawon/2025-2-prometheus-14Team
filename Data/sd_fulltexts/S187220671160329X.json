DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60329-X ARTICLE Novel Approach to Benzimidazoles Using Fe 3 O 4 Nanoparticles as a Magnetically Recoverable Catalyst Bahador KARAMI 1, *, Shaghayegh NIKOSERESHT 2 , Saeed KHODABAKHSHI 1 1 Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasouj, Iran 2 Department of Chemistry, Gachsaran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Gachsaran, Iran Abstract: Magnetically recoverable Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles have been synthesized as a catalyst for the cyclocondensation of 1,2-phenylenediamines with orthoesters under solvent-free conditions. Catalyst loadings can be as low as 1 mol% to give high yields of the corresponding benzimidazole derivative at 80 Â°C. This green method offers significant advantages in terms of its simplicity, low catalyst loadings, high product yields, and non-toxic nature. The Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Key words: ferroferric oxide nanoparticle; 1,2-phenylenediamine; orthoester; benzimidazole The challenge in chemistry is to develop practical methods with convenient conditions and reagents, and the concept of â€œgreen chemistryâ€� is becoming ever important in the scientific community. Green chemistry is emerging as a high-priority guiding principle for organic synthesis. Recently, the prepara- tion and application of nanoparticles (NPs) in organic synthesis has been the subject of intense interest [1â€“4]. Using NPs offers advantages for â€œcleanâ€� chemistry, since, in addition to being readily recovered, they are non-toxic and widely accessible. The NP surface can also be functionalized to append catalyti- cally active groups [5,6]. In this work, we describe a new and green strategy for the preparation of novel and known benzimidazoles using Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. These have proved as powerful, safe, and recy- clable catalysts under solvent-free conditions. In a previous study, Goosen and co-workers [7] reported the catalytic de- carboxylative cross-ketonisation of aryl- and alkylcarboxylic acids using Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. In recent years, the development of improved synthetic routes to heterocyclic compounds has attracted special atten- tion [8â€“10]. Among the wide variety of nitrogen heterocycles that have been explored as pharmaceutically important com- pounds, benzimidazoles exhibit relatively high biological ac- tivities. They have exhibited activity against cancer [11], HIV [12,13], herpes (HSV-1) [14], influenza [15], certain fungi [16], and raf kinase [17]. The most prominent benzimidazole compound in nature is N-ribosyldimethylbenzimidazole, which serves as an axial ligand for cobalt in vitamin B 12 [18]. Until now, several methods for the synthesis of benzimida- zoles and derivatives thereof have been reported. The most common method is the condensation of an arylenediamine with a carbonyl equivalent [19,20]. Esters, lactones, and anhydrides can also produce benzimidazoles through the cyclization of amide [21]. However, some of these reported methods suffer from drawbacks, such as the requirement for toxic and expen- sive catalysts and solvents, long reaction times, low yields, and difficult work-up procedures. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles FeCl 3 (5.2 g) and FeCl 2 (2.0 g) were successively dissolved in 25 ml distilled water with 0.85 ml 12.1 mol/L HCl. The resulting solution was added dropwise to a 250 ml 1.5 mol/L NaOH solution with vigorous stirring. The last step generates an instant black precipitate. The precipitate was isolated in a magnetic field, and the supernatant was removed from the precipitate through decantation [22]. Bahador KARAMI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 298â€“301 1.2 Characterization of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were car- ried out with a JEOL JEM 3010 instrument, operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8, Advance, Bruker, axs) patterns were obtained for the charac- terization of the heterogeneous catalysts. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu-470 spectrometer using KBr pellets. 1.3 Synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives A mixture of 1,2-phenylenediamine 1 (1 mmol), orthoester 2 (1 mmol), and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (2.32 mg, 1 mol%) was stirred and heated at 80 Â°C for the appropriate time. Upon completion (as adjudged by TLC, silica-gel 60 F 254 , n-hexane:ethyl acetate), hot EtOH/H 2 O (50/50, 10 ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the catalyst was separated through magnetic absorption using a magnet. After separating the catalyst, the solution was heated and filtered to afford the pure product 3 in the crystal form. At the end of the reaction, the separated catalyst was washed with diethyl ether, dried at 130 Â°C for 1 h, and reused in another cycle. The general pro- cedure is shown in Scheme 1. All synthesized compounds (3aâ€“3i) were characterized via analytical and spectroscopic methods. Melting points were determined on a KRUSS model instrument. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 400 NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz, in which CDCl 3 was used as solvent and TMS as the internal standard. All products (except for novel compounds) were characterized through comparison with the reported in the literatures [23â€“27]. 2 Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern for the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. A number of prominent Bragg reflections, as assigned from their indices ((220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440)), reveal that the resultant nanoparticles are Fe 3 O 4 with a spinel structure [28]. The size of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles was also determined from X-ray line broadening, using the De- bye-Scherrer formula, which is given as D = 0.9 / cos , where D is the average crystalline size, is the applied X-ray wave- length, is the angular line width at half maximum intensity, and is the Braggâ€™s angle. For the (311) reflection, the average size of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles was estimated to be around 13 nm. Figure 2 shows the TEM image of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. The TEM image reveals spherical Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm. The FT-IR spectrum for the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 3. The absorbance bands at 584.3 cm â€“1 are ascribed to Fe 2+ O 2â€“ , and are consistent with those reported for spinel Fe 3 O 4 [29,30]. In the past few years, we have been involved in a program directed towards developing simple, novel, and facile methods for the preparation of organic compounds using a range of catalysts and readily available starting materials [23â€“27]. In this study, we present a simple route towards novel and known benzimidazoles 3 through the reaction of 1,2-phenylenedia- mines 1 with orthoesters 2 using Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles as a NH 2 NH 2 G Solvent-free, 80 o C + 3 R 2 OH O R 1 O O R 2 R 2 R 2 N H N R 1 G 2 + 1 3 G: H, Me, NO 2 , Benzoyl Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (1 mol%) R 1 and R 2 : H, Me, Et Scheme 1.

Bahador KARAMI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 298â€“301 magnetically recoverable catalyst (Scheme 1). To identify the suitable reaction conditions for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives 3 using these Fe 3 O 4 nanoparti- cles, triethyl orthoformate and o-phenylene diamine were selected as the model reaction. As can be seen in Table 1, we found that in the absence of the catalyst, the reaction did not proceed, even at a high temperature. Through screening, we found that this reaction proceeded smoothly with 1 mol% catalyst at 80 Â°C under solvent-free conditions in only 12 min. Higher loadings of catalyst did not affect a marked influence on the product yield. This may be due to the coordination of ex- cessive catalyst to the diamine. To prove the general applicability of this method, after op- timizing the reaction conditions, different orthoesters and o-phenylenediamines were examined. The results are summa- rized in Table 2. Encouraged by the above results, we then focused our at- tention on 4-benzoyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, to prepare new benzimidazoles 3j, 3k, and 3l. The results obtained are sum- marized in Table 3. The 1 H NMR spectrum for 3l gave a triplet for the protons of the methyl group (Î´ = 1.47), a quartet for the protons of the methylene group (Î´ = 3.00) and a set of multiplet signals (Î´ = 7.82â€“7.45, 7.23â€“7.27) that correspond to the aromatic protons. The resonance for the NH proton appeared as a broad signal at Î´ = 10.80â€“10.40. The carbonyl groups in the 13 C NMR spec- trum of 3l appeared at Î´ = 197.62. To compare the catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 powder with that of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, two parallel reactions were per- formed. As shown in Table 4, the product yields were moderate (55%â€“75%) after 50â€“70 min with the Fe 3 O 4 powder, whilst the 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 50 100 T r a n s m i t t a n c e ( % ) Wavenumber (cm âˆ’1 ) Fig. 3.

Bahador KARAMI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 298â€“301 Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles provided excellent yields (82%â€“91%) after 8â€“12 min under solvent-free conditions. The design and synthesis of recoverable catalysts is a highly challenging interdisciplinary field, which combines chemistry, materials science, and engineering from economic and envi- ronmental perspective. The main disadvantage for many of the reported methods is that the catalysts are destroyed in the work-up procedure and cannot be recovered or re-used. In this process, as outlined in Fig. 4, the recycled catalyst can be used in up to five cycles, during which there are negligible losses in the catalytic activity. 3 Conclusions A green methodology for the preparation of novel and known benzimidazole derivatives, using magnetically recov- erable Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles under solvent-free conditions has been presented. This method not only provides high yields and purities, but it is also cheap, convenient, quick, and economi- cally friendly.

Tel: +98-741-2223048; Fax: +98-741-2242167 Magnetically recoverable Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been synthesized as a catalyst for the cyclocondensation of 1,2-phenylenediamines with orthoesters under solvent-free conditions. Catalyst loadings can be as low as 1 mol% to give high yields of the corresponding benzimidazole derivative at 80 °C. This green method offers significant advantages in terms of its simplicity, low catalyst loadings, high product yields, and non-toxic nature. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Graphical abstract This manuscript describes an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of some benzimidazoles using Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This method has some advantages, such as high yield of product, short reaction times, and avoidance of organic solvents.
