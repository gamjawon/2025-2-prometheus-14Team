B. 158, H-8201 Veszpr, Hungary Received 8 April 1997; received in revised form 22 July 1997; accepted 22 July 1997 A radioactive - pulse-flow - method has been developed for measuring HZS uptake by catalysts in a flow system during HZS/HZ purging. As opposed to the classical pulse procedure, the S/(Ni + W) values calculated from radioactivity data obtained in a pulse-flow regime are in acceptable agreement with literature values by XPS and TPS methods. The temperature dependence of HZS uptake was identical for the NiW catalyst on different supports, whereas it was different for the NiMo catalyst. The uptake maximum was observed at 100 for NiMo/A1203, and at 200 for NiW/A1203 and NiW/Si0z-A1203. Periods of constant HZS uptake were observed, followed by periods of increasing HZS uptake after 35-65 min of sulfidation. This indicates the existence of permanent interaction between the sulfided catalyst and gas phase HS. _ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. Keywords: Sulfur uptake; Radioactive sulfur; Supported NiW and NiMo 1. Introduction Sulfided molybdena-alumina and tungsten-alumina catalysts are extensively utilized in hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reactions, and have an extensive research background[ 1-8]. The catalyst precursors - calcined molybdenum (or tungsten-) oxygen species - usually form a thin amorphous monolayer on the support at low (<10-20%) concentrations [9-14]. They exist in different forms, L: isolated tetrahedral species, IL: polymolybdates or tungstates,111.: M003 (or W03), depending on loading [9,12,14] and on calcination temperature [15]. *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ~~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00241-X M(8-10) metals interact with the polymolybdate [16] or polytungstate phase [12] and form the respective isopoly-salt. Some IR data indicate, however, the formation of M003 from polymolybdate-alumina following the introduction of Ru [17]. The calcined precursors are activated by sulfidation usually in HZ/H2S mixtures. Koryi et al. found [ 18] a marked correlation between surface S'`--concentration and HDS activity of a sulfided CoMo/-y-A1203 catalyst. This correlation is also demonstrated by the substantial increase of catalytic activity in thiophene HDS by addition of HZS pulses to the HZ-stream during HZ treatment of a molybdena/alumina catalyst [11]. Both HZ and HZS reduce the Mo(VI)- or W(Vl)oxygen species, though, H2S is more active in this reduction process [19]. O-S exchange is easier than 66 M. Dobrovolszky et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 65-74 metal-oxygen bond breaking with H, [20,21]. HZS converts the terminal Mo=O or W=O of surface bound molybdate or tungstate via oxysulfide into MOSS or WS3 and produces MOS2 or WSZ [22,23]. The mechanism of the process involves, anionic vacancies formed in the reducing atmosphere [20]: FMS H H -~0 S o Iq -> I I -~ I I o so H 0 0 ---> ~S/ \\0 H T-- ~S ~0 H --i IS o This explains the formation of oxysulfides and the correlation between anionic vacancies, surface acidity and the extent of H2S uptake. The last of these indicates the propensity to extract sulfur from the organic molecules, i. e. the activity in HDS [24]. Addition of Co or Ni leads to a large increase in the activity which increases the attributed to Co-Mo-S or Ni-Mo-S interactions [24]. It has also been found that the Mo-O-A1 (or W-O-Al) bridges present in calcined catalysts must be broken during sulfiding whereupon surface OH and SH groups are formed [25]. The sulfidation of metal-oxygen species is also affected by the presence of ambient water, produced by the reaction. Wet catalysts were sulfided at substantially (at 200-300) lower temperatures than the dry ones [21]. The higher activity of \"aged\" Mo/A1203 is also explained by the uptake of the ambient water; this effect is explained by the formation of the structure [26,27]: ,O o ~o \\\\ M o /I\\ o o o A120, As the result of the weakening of the Mo=O bond, the activation energy of sulfidation is lowered. On the other hand, adsorbed water provides more surface protons and removes surface oxygen during sulfiding; this also leads to a lower activation energy [21] (Br6nsted site assisted sulfidation). It is seen that the capacity for sulfur uptake, which is an important property of hydrotreatment catalysts, is influenced by a variety of factors such as the concentration of anionic vacancies produced by reduction, that of the Br6nsted acid sites of the support or of those formed during the reaction. Besides XPS and TPS methods, the radioactive tracer method is also utilized in studying the sulfur uptake of such catalysts [8,28-31]. The advantage of the isotopic tracer method is the possibility to monitor the sulfur uptake during the process. In these studies, the presence of two types of sulfur was indicated: one being more easily exchangeable (labile) than the other. Catalysts subjected to total sulfidation before undergoing any reaction were mainly dealt with in these studies. In a series of contributions, we reported on the sulfur uptake by non sulfided molybdena-alumina catalysts promoted with different metals [11,32]. The aim of these latter studies was to gain information on the initial stages of sulfidation, and on the mechanism of the formation of the catalytic system. H2 35s uptake was measured in a pulse system by injecting radioactive H2 35S impulses into a HZ-stream thereby enabling the HZS uptake to be calculated from the loss of radioactivity of the impulses. The data obtained indicated that the hydrogen sulfide uptake depends to a great extent on the degree of sulfidation of the catalyst: a substantial decrease of HZS uptake has been observed with increasing number of HZS pulses with all of the catalysts investigated [32]. The differences in the uptake between the first and the second HZS pulses were the highest; they varied between 35 and 60 percent [32]. This can be explained by the decreasing number of anionic vacancies [20], as the small amount of HZS injected in a pulse, forms new vacancies by reducing the sample only to a limited extent. This explanation is based on the existence of a correlation between HDS activity and anion vacancies [19,24,25,33-351. We reported elsewhere [36,37] on a study which has been carried out on HZS uptake of radioactive H2 35s by Ni-W/-y-A1203 (ALA), NiW/amorphous silicaalumina (ASA), and NiMo/ALA catalyst. The HS uptake of different catalysts was determined and a correlation was found between sulfur uptake, Lewis acidity and thiophene HDS activity. It is pointed out, however, that these data were obtained in a pulse system. In a flow system - applied generally in practice for performing HDS - the catalysts are permanently exposed to HZS. By virtue of this permanent interaction between the catalyst and HZS, both the M. Dobrovolszky et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 65-74 decrease of Lewis acidity [37] and the forming of OH and SH [20,25], i.e. the formation of Br6nsted acidity has been observed. It is also noteworthy, that the maximum S/(Ni + W) values obtained by our radioactive measurements carried out in a pulse system [37] were 4-5 times lower than those obtained by other authors for these catalysts by XPS and TPS methods [38,39]. This indicates that the sulfidation in the pulse system did not reach the maximum. It follows from all these, that the uptake of sulfur could be different under flow system conditions from that measured in the pulse one. In order to study HZS uptake in the permanent presence of HZS, a method was developed based on injection of radioactive H235S/HZ pulses into a non radioactive H2S/HZ stream treating the catalyst in contact flow. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The study was performed with -y-A1203 (ALA) and amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) supported NiW catalysts (1.29 x 102at/g Ni and 3.95 x 1020 at/g W). A NiMo/ALA catalyst was also studied (2.26 x 102at/g and 6.45 x 102at/g Ni and Mo respectively). Details of preparation are to be found in ref. [38] for NiW, and in ref. [39] for NiMo. (For simplicity NiOWO, and NiOMoOX are respectively denoted throughout the paper as NiW and NiMo). The specific surface values were 313, 361, and 287 m 2/g for NiW/ ASA, NiW/ALA and NiMo/ALA respectively [36,37] as measured by the B.E.T. method, by adsorption of N2- The reducibility of the catalysts in hydrogen was low, as we reported previously [37]: the H/(Ni + W) values were 0.97 and 1.47 for ASA and ALA supported samples respectively, and 0.46 for H/(Ni + Mo) as measured by TPR at 400 [36,37]. 2.1.1. Apparatus and procedure A glass microcatalytic pulse reactor (Fig. 1) was employed for the HZS uptake measurements. H235S/HZ pulses of 0.1 ml NTP (containing 3.3-1.5 x 1015 molecules (0.1 %) of H2S, decreasing continuously with increasing pulse number as the pressure in 67 H2S/H 2 H\"S/H2 2 4 .2 3 Fig. 1.

H2S vessel decreased from N85 to 40 kPa) were injected in 5 min intervals into a carrier H2S/HZ stream (30 NTP ml/min) with 0.1 % of inactive HZS, i.e. the H2S content of the stream was similar to that of the pulse. The samples (10 mg of each) were treated continuously in the non radioactive H2S/HZ stream and the radioactive pulses were injected at 25, 100, 200, 300 followed by 16 pulses at 350 16 pulses at 400 1 pulse at 400 and 15 pulses at 450 The outlet stream was introduced to an in situ flowthrough radioactivity detector with a disc-like cavity [40,41 ]. An Eu-doped CaF2 scintillator crystal formed one of the flat surfaces at the end of the cavity for determining the radioactivity (the 35S content) of gases leaving the reactor. Details of the measurement of radioactivity are described elsewhere [37]. 68 M. Dobrovolszky et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 65-74 The amounts of HZS retained by the catalyst were determined from the loss of radioactivity of the introduced H235S. Experiments carried out with these catalysts in a pulse system indicated [37] that the NiW catalysts retained only traces of radioactive hydrogen sulfide at 25 in HZ atmosphere, whereas, the NiMo/ALA retained 16 3% at the first HZS pulse at that temperature, as measured from three parallel experiments. The radioactivity values of the outflow gases at 25 served as standards for comparison with the radioactivity of the outflow gases and for calculating the HZS uptake at higher temperatures. The sulfur retained by the catalyst was given as a percentage of the injected radioactive pulses. The mean uncertainties in sulfur uptake data as calculated from parallel measurements with different samples, from the same batch, all with identical pretreatment were t2% for NiW/ALA and NiMo/ALA, and t3% for NiW/ASA. The uptake values of HZS from the HZS/Hz stream were calculated as a ratio of the H2S (7.52 x 1017 mol/ min) introduced; the values of this ratio were determined by radioactivity measurements of uptake from the injected H235S/H2 pulses. Calculation of H2S uptake from the H2S/Hz stream was carried out by 50 40 30 70 0 25 0 interpolating the data from two neighbouring radioactivity measurements. Sulfur uptake of the supports was measured up to a sulfidation temperature of 400, but only the ALA support took up 2-3% of the introduced pulse irrespective of the applied temperature [37]. Since this was within the order of the uncertainties of the measurements, no corrections were made to the uptake by the support. 3. Results and discussion The uptake of radioactive sulfur from H235S/HZ pulses is indicated for the heating up period in Fig. 2. The temperature dependence of the uptake is identical for the two NiW catalysts, irrespective of the support. Two sulfidation maxima were observed: at 200 and 400. The temperature dependence is different for the NiMo catalyst: the peak appears at a lower temperature, 100, and no sulfidation peaks were observed at higher temperatures.

It is noteworthy that the ratio at the uptake maxima from one pulse is the same for the pulse system as that of the flow system (Table 1). The ratio of total uptake from the sum of radioactive pulses injected for the heating up period is higher in the pulse system than that for the flow one(Table 2). In the case of the pulse system, the catalyst is treated only with radioactive H2S, consequently the possible exchange between surface bound sulfur and that in the gas phase would not affect the loss of radioactivity in the gas phase and the HS uptake data calculated from that. However, since catalysts in a flow system are treated in a non-radioactive H2S/H2 flow, it is possible that the loss of radioactivity of the pulses is higher than the net sulfur uptake, because of the exchange between radioactive gas phase H2S and surface bound non-radioactive sulfur. This means that the virtual sulfur uptake in this case would be higher from a pulse in pulse flow regime than in a pulse system, but because of the equal ratio of H2S uptake at the maxima from one pulse (Table 1), and because of the higher ratio of cumulated uptake from all pulses injected for the heating up period (Table 2) this case can be excluded. We assume therefore, that the sulfur exchange does not play a significant role in the heating up period. The lower temperature of the H2S-uptake maxima by the molybdenum containing catalysts is possibly a consequence of the differences between the thermodynamic properties of Mo- and W-oxygen and sulfur containing compounds. The O - S conversion pertains to the M(VI)=O groups of the polymolybdate or polytungstate [20]. We accept therefore, the thermodynamic functions of M003 and W03 for estimating the free enthalpy changes of the M(VI)=O M(IV)S2 conversion. The differences of standard free energy of formation between M03 and MS2 are 569 and 452 kJ/mol for W- and Mo containing compounds respectively [42]. This can explain the easier O -> S conversion of Mo=O. A different approach is also possible by calculating the energy barrier of the formation of a surface intermediate (M = W or Mo): -SH by Balandin's method [43], applying the surface bond strengths Q[M03ri O], Q[M03_H]: 256 and 213 kJ/mol respectively, for W and 179 and 256 kJ/ mol for Mo as determined by a kinetic method [43,44]. The metal-sulfur single bond strengths from the formation enthalpies [45] are 138 and 130 kJ/mol for Mo and W respectively. The difference of the energy barrier of formation of the surface intermediate (4) if n = 1 in kJ/mol is given by: E(W) - E(Mo) = (2 X 256 - 2 X 179) - (130 - 138) - (213 - 256) = 205 (5) in other words, the energy barrier of formation is substantially higher for tungsten-containing compounds than that for compounds containing molybdenum. Data on retained amounts of radioactive H2S at constant temperatures (350, 400, 450) are shown in Figs. 3-5. It is seen that the H2S uptake decreases at the beginning. This is identical with that observed in a 70 M.

From pulses Nos. 7-10 (i.e. Nos. 3-6 at the given temperature) the uptake values become practically constant. The constant uptake is substantially higher in the case of NiMo catalysts than that for NiW catalysts. The periods of constant uptake are followed -with the exception of NiW at 350 and NiMoat 400 - by increasing HZS uptake. The existence of periods of constant and increasing uptake is different from that observed with catalysts in a pulse system [36,37], and indicates a constant and even increasing catalyst-HZS interaction. It is not clear how far this interaction results from the formation of new anionic vacancies by reduction of W(VI) or Mo(VI) with HzS/HZ or whether, this is a consequence of the exchange between surface sulfides and gaseous HZS (as data in the Tables 1 and 2 indicate only the absence of significant exchange during the heating up period). Special studies on sulfur exchange are in progress to clarify this problem. A further comparison of the uptake values in the pulse and the flow systems can be made from some characteristic numerical data collected in Table 1. It is seen from this table, that the HZS uptake is significantly higher by the NiMo catalyst both in flow and in pulse systems than that by NiW catalysts. The total uptake in the pulse system is higher than that in the flow one during the heating up period (Table 2). This was also the case with the uptake from the first five pulses at 350 and 400 for all three catalysts (Table 3). These uptake values were, however, equal for the NiW catalysts at 450 in the two systems, whereas, the uptake for the NiMo catalyst remained substantially higher for the pulse than for the flow system at this temperature, too.

Dobrovolszky et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 65-74 The higher uptake of radioactive H2S in the pulse system, compared with that in the flow one can be explained by the hindering of uptake of radioactive H2S due to the presence of high amounts of nonradioactive hydrogen sulfide thereby blocking the anionic vacancies. This blocking effect is well known from our previous studies with M(8-10) metal containing molybdena-alumina catalysts [32] and with the catalysts applied in recent studies [36,37]. In addition to the existence of the blocking effect, there is an opposite one also: this being the formation of new anionic vacancies due to further reduction of W(VI) (or Mo(VI)) by excess non-radioactive hydrogen sulfide introduced by constant HZ/H2S stream in the flow system. This is supported by the existence of second sulfidation peaks on the curves of Fig. 2 for NiW catalysts at 400, which cannot be found in the pulse system. The appearance of the period of increasing uptake also supports this explanation. Presumably, in this case the dynamic equilibrium ceases and the formation rate of new sites becomes higher than the rate of blocking. Table 4 shows the total radioactive H2S uptake values up to the beginning of the constant periods of uptake. The uptake values of radioactive HZS are again higher in the pulse system than in the flow one. Consequently, the effect of sulfur exchange on the H2S uptake data in flow systems up to the starting points of the constant uptake period can probably be excluded. From the ratio of the uptake determined by radioactivity, we calculated the values of the total HZS uptake in the flow system - as described in the Table 5 Uptake of HZS by different catalysts in the flow system Table 4 Total H2 35S uptake up to the beginning of the constant uptake period Temperature () NiW/ASA P P-F P 350 26 13 27 400 25 24 22 450 24 17 24 NiW/ALA NiMo/ALA P-F P P-F 15 53 27 20 55 33 20 56 30 Experimental section: the values of the ratio of HAS uptake from the injected HZ S5S/H2 pulses in the flow system (Table 1) were used for these calculations. The results obtained are collected in Table 5, indicating the H2S uptake data for the time up to the beginning of the period of constant uptake, and up to the starting point of its increase at different temperatures. From the data of H2S uptake, the S/(Ni + W) and S/(Ni + Mo) values were calculated. The values calculated from the total uptake up to the beginning of the constant uptake period at 400 (1.22 and 1.31 for S/(Ni + W) on ASA and ALA supports respectively) are in adequate agreement with XPS [38] (1.12 and 1.28) and TPS [39] data - 1.34 and 1.46. There were no substantial differences between the W and Mo containing catalysts with respect to S/(Ni + W) and S/(Ni + Mo) values, at 450 in agreement with our previous observations [36,37] for radioactive H2S uptake in a pulse system. These S/[Ni + W(Mo)] values calculated from radioactivity data obtained in a flow system were, however, 5-6 times higher than those obtained at sulfidation in the pulse system.

Dobrovolszky et al. /Applied Catalysis 4. Conclusions The sulfidation of catalysts can be followed in a flow system in a HZS/HZ stream by injecting radioactive Hz35S/HZ pulses. The advantage of this flow method is the production of data on HZS uptake by catalysts in the permanent presence of HZS. The sulfur uptake data obtained by this method agree well with those determined by TPS and XPS. The ratio of sulfur uptake from one pulse at the maximum of the curve-uptake vs. temperature is equal both in pulse and flow systems. The uptake maxima appear, however, for NiW catalysts at higher temperatures (300) in the pulse system than in the flow one (200). The uptake maximum for the NiMo catalyst appears for both systems at 100. The H2S uptake from one H2S/H2 pulse reaches a constant value (5-10% for NiW, N20% for NiMo) in the flow system, but a small increase of uptake is also observed after 35-65 min from the beginning of sulfidation. The existence of periods both of constant and increasing uptake indicates a permanent interaction between the catalyst and the H2S gas phase.

A radioactive - pulse-flow - method has been developed for measuring H2S uptake by catalysts in a flow system during H2S/H2 purging. As opposed to the classical pulse procedure, the S/(Ni+W) values calculated from radioactivity data obtained in a pulse-flow regime are in acceptable agreement with literature values by XPS and TPS methods. The temperature dependence of H2S uptake was identical for the NiW catalyst on different supports, whereas it was different for the NiMo catalyst. The uptake maximum was observed at 100°C for NiMo/Al2O3, and at 200°C for NiW/Al2O3 and NiW/SiO2-Al2O3. Periods of constant H2S uptake were observed, followed by periods of increasing H2S uptake after 35–65 min of sulfidation. This indicates the existence of permanent interaction between the sulfided catalyst and gas phase H2S. Keywords Sulfur uptake Radioactive sulfur Supported NiW and NiMo References [1] Gates B.C.
