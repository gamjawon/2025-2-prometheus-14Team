It was shown that a complex sequence of reactions during the activation process (reduction of the magnetite precursor) leads to a metastable form of c~-iron. A detailed examination of the diffraction lines of iron helped to elucidate the question, why \"ammonia iron\" is so much superior to \"normal iron\". Unusual line profiles were observed which could be controlled by changing the reaction conditions. Platelet crystallites of defective alpha-iron form the outer shell of isotropic bulk iron particles which represent the main body of the catalyst material. A shoulder at higher d values of the Fe(110) reflection points to the formation of an iron/nitrogen phase during catalytic action. The crystallographic observations are in line with previous data on paracrystallinity, but their interpretation is of a different nature. The structural effects of oxygen poisoning were investigated. It is shown, why the poisoning is detrimental for the catalytic performance and how the speculation could arise that this effect may be beneficial for the reaction. Keywords.\" Ammonia synthesis; Iron; In situ X-ray diffraction; Oxygen poisoning 1. Introduction It is well established that ammonia synthesis is efficiently catalysed by a special form of iron prepared from oxidic precursors [1,2], while ordinary bulk iron is rather inefficient [3].

PII S0926- 860X(96)00042-7 72 Bernhar Herzog et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 investigations and focused on current experimental results aimed at a better understanding of how the catalyst operates [4]. The significance of structural and electronic promoters was highlighted. But still there is no explanation of the structural identity of \"ammonia iron\". The turn-over number (TON) of the active site was determined using high-temperature chemisorption of nitrogen on a variety of iron species and was found to be independent on the catalysts nature [5]. The value of the TON points to the presence of C7 sites on (111) or higher indexed surface planes of iron [6]. This is in full agreement with the results from single crystal measurements [7] and indicates that not a principally different chemical property discriminates \"ammonia iron\" from normal iron but rather a different abundance of active sites. We conclude that this should be reflected in a different microstructure and thus look for average structural differences by X-ray diffraction. The concept of paracrystallinity introduced by Hosemann et al. in 1966 [8] was used earlier to describe the phenomenon of \"ammonia iron\". They developed the theory of paracrystallinity from X-ray diffraction data which seemed to explain the special properties of the activated iron catalyst [9]. A three-dimensional, endotactic incorporation of hercynite (FeA1204) motives into the a-iron lattice was thought to create substitutional point defects in the crystal lattice leading to a modified bulk and surface structure of the activated catalyst material. The interplanar spacings change and a strain field exists in the vicinity of those defects. Paracrystallinity was defined as the normalised standard deviation of a crystallographic interplanar distance, and it is measured by the width of X-ray diffraction (XRD) lines [10-12]. The explanation of endotactic heterostructures in molecular dispersion for the X-ray anomalies of \"ammonia iron\" was rejected by MiSssbauer spectroscopy [13] and EXAFS [14,15]. The Mbssbauer data imply the presence of small amounts of non-metal iron components which are present, however, as large particles of structural promoter oxides. They are located in grain boundaries and at the outer surface of the catalyst [ 12,16]. This location also explains the SIMS data on Fe-Al-O fragments which were intended to support the hypothesis of endotactic heterostructures [ 17]. The EXAFS data [ 14,15] provide clear evidence for the identical average local coordination of iron in \"ammonia iron\" and normal iron. Keeping this large body of information in mind we concentrate on an alternative analysis of the undisputed fact [3] that the line profiles of \"ammonia iron\" and normal iron are not identical. In the first part we will follow the activation of the catalyst in synthesis gas mixtures starting from an oxidic precursor. Secondly, the average microstructure of the iron catalyst will be discussed using in situ powder diffraction data. In part three we will focus on the structural effects of oxygen as catalyst poison. This work was triggered by recent reports of a potential promoting effect of water/oxygen pulses on the ammonia yield [18]. Bernhar Herzog et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 73 2. Experimental X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) proved to be a well-suited technique in several previous investigations concerning ammonia catalysts [4,19-21]. We used an in situ XRPD set-up to probe the bulk structure of the catalyst in different stages of the process. The apparatus consists of a modified Btihler high temperature camera equipped with special gas inlets. The camera is fixed to a Stoe and Cie diffractometer system working in Bragg-Bretano geometry. For data collection a scintillation counter equipped with a diffracted beam monochromator and a discriminator system was applied to suppress X-ray fluorescence of the iron samples when working with Cu K a radiation. The use of alternative X-ray wavelengths avoiding fluorescence turned out to be less effective with respect to the counting statistics due to the reduced anode power which is possible with alternative wavelengthsThe use of Mo radiation was also tested but gave at higher order reflections worse results in resolution than the observation of the (110) reflection with Cu radiationSimultaneous reaction monitoring was done with a Balzers QMG 400 mass spectrometer which is directly connected to the outlet of the high temperature cameraA detailed description of the in situ XRPD apparatus is given elsewhere [22]. All diffraction profiles were resolved by appropriate profile fitting and calibrated against a Si internal standardFig. 1 shows as a criterion of quality the analysis of the measured thermal expansion of the Si standard compared to that of the magnetite precursor in relation to their theoretical values (straight lines). The lattice constants were calculated from the d values of the Si(220) and the Fe304(311) reflections. The straight lines show the expected linear thermal expansion of the lattice parameterLinear regression led to measured values of C~si = 3.46 10-6 and Oemagnetite = 9.49 10-6 which compare well to the theoretical thermal expansion coefficients c%i = 3 10-6 and O:magnetite ~--- 9.5 10 6. The data were used as \"in situ thermometer\" to check the temperature of the catalyst sample against the heater element temperature. Under gas flow conditions no deviations were detected within the range of the error bar in Fig. 1. All investigations were performed using technical catalyst materials from H. Topsoe (KM 1) applying its optimised activation procedures [23]. The samples (40 mg) were studied in a 1\" 1 atmosphere of nitrogen/hydrogen at 10000 space velocity. This composition was chosen to minimise heat transfer to the cell walls of the camera during the long experimental runs (some required over one month on stream). The characteristics of the cell were those of a differential reactor. Only after applying highly purified gases we obtained measurable ammonia production at atmospheric pressures. For a detailed discussion see Ref. [241. Several results rely on the correct observation of integrated diffracted intensi- ties. Even relative intensity measurements are somewhat critical.

The internal Si standard was used to check the positional stability of the sample which required slow motions and limited angular movements. Experiments which revealed occasional positional instability were rejected. 3. Results 3.1. Characterisation and activation of the catalyst system 3.1.1. The catalyst precursor A well-resolved XRPD pattern (Fig. 2) displays all components constituting a technical catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The main reflections can be assigned to magnetite (Fe304) and wuestite (FeO). Additional faint reflections are observed arising from calcium ferrite (CaFe3Os), potassium hydrogen carbonate (KHCO3), and a-iron (denoted as C, K, and a-Fe in Fig. 2).

Phase analysis of a technical catalyst precursor for ammonia synthesis. High resolution XRPD data show the existence of promoter compounds besides the main component magnetite; K = KHCO3, C = CaF%O5, M = magnetite (magnetite reflections are indexed in the upper diagram). this catalyst precursor is reflected in the coexistence of magnetite, wuestite, and c~-iron within a single sample. This combination of phases is unique for this catalyst precursor as within one solid metastable phases both with respect to their oxygen fugacity and the phase equilibrium at ambient conditions [3] do coexist. Under topochemical control of the activation process [4] a non-isotropic agglomerate of elemental iron will be formed which in itself may be one explanation of the nature of \"ammonia iron\" [4]. EDX analyses showed that the precursor material also contains some silicon and aluminium in addition to calcium, potassium, and iron. While some of the wuestite and the silicon components are not detectable by phase analysis with XRPD because of their X-ray amorphous microstructure, the presence of aluminium is indicated by distinct textural changes of the reflection intensities of the magnetite precursor (Table 1). The fine structure of some reflections, together with deviation in the lattice constants of magnetite, point to the presence of a solid solution with hercynite (FeAI204) [23,25,26]. 3.1.2. Activation of the catalyst Activation of the iron oxide precursor is achieved by a slow topotactic reduction [4]. The different parameters of such an activation (pH2, pH20, pO2, temperature, heating rate, space velocity) must be controlled correctly to prevent any damage of the catalyst system. Especially Ostwald ripening and poisoning by oxygen and water are detrimental for the performance of the catalyst. 76 Bernhar Herzog et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 Table 1 Comparison of the reflection intensities (in %) of pure magnetite and the texture catalyst precursor Miller index Pure magnetite Magnetite precursor (220) 30 12 (311) 100 100 (222) 8 3 (400) 20 25 (422) 10 6 (511) 30 9 (440) 40 7 (533) 10 9 (622) 4 3 In situ XRPD data shown in Fig. 3 illustrate, that the first change in the phase inventory with beginning activation is the loss of the FeO phase being converted into iron nuclei. This elemental iron is produced from thermal decomposition of the wuestite phase within the precursor as can be seen by inspection of the diffraction pattern. The metastable wuestite can disproportionate at any tempera- ture between room temperature and 840 K: 4FeO -* Fe + Fe304 (1) The apparent isotropic particle size of the iron particles was estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Scherrer equation to be ca. 80 nm.

Development of \"ammonia iron\" from the magnetite precursor. Nuclei of isotropic a-iron form in the beginning of the activation process (see also Figs. 4 and 5). Diffuse reflections of a non-stoichiometric wuestite phase (#) superimpose the Fe304(400). Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 77 \"ammonia iron\" exhibits a strong texture. Microscopic studies showed the iron particles to be textured in the [111] direction [3]. Unfortunately, the Fe(111) line is not detectable for symmetry reasons. But the texture is characterised by smaller (hOO)/(hkO) ratios than calculated from the structure factors of isotropic c~-iron. The fact that the (200)/(110) ratio of the initially formed detectable iron particles is identical with the theoretical value of 0.2 unambiguously indicates the formation of isotropic iron formed form decomposed wuestite. This elemental iron is essential to initiate the reduction of magnetite with hydrogen at low temperatures. Iron nuclei are required reaction centres since reduction of magnetite does not follow the simple overall reaction: Fe304 + 4H2 ~ 3Fe + 4H20 (2) The mechanism of activation rather proceeds via two types of reactions involving the diffusion of ions and electrons [27,28]. Type 1 402-+4H2 --, 4H20 + 8e- Type 2 Fe304 + Fe2++ 2e- ~ 4FeO 4FeO ~ 4Fe2++ 402- 4Fe2+ 8e- ~ 4Fe Fe304 + Fe + 4H2 ~ 4Fe + 4H20 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) In this mechanism the iron nuclei are centres to which iron ions diffuse driven by a local gradient of the electrochemical potential. Otherwise the reaction would stop after the initial reduction, when the magnetite core of a grain is covered by a dense iron layer. This mechanism of reduction causes a restructuring of the magnetite crystals and the loss of the topochemistry of the magnetite grains provided that the reaction is slow enough to permit the migration of cations according to the concentration gradients. The fact that highly dispersed wuestite is present in the magnetite matrix permits the simultaneous formation of many iron nuclei and hence the occurrence of a network of concentration gradients of iron ions which is not determined by the grain structure of the magnetite. Consequently, the resulting iron particles are of smaller size and may be of different shape than the magnetite precursors. This is illustrated by Figs. 3 and 4. The line profile of the iron formed is different from that of the magnetite precursor. In addition, the intensity of the magnetite reflections disappears highly anisotropically with increasing abundance of the crystalline iron. The magnetite crystals do not shrink isotropically in size but change their shape as the migration of iron along certain directions is faster than along other directions. The reflection intensity ratio (440)/(511) of the magnetite changes from 0.78 at room temperature to 78 Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 30 32 34 Fe(110) (311) 36 42 44 46 Diffraction angle [e] 675 3 645 B E\" 62o N Fig. 4. Although the (400) reflection (indicated by the dashed line) has almost disappeared, the phase magnetite is still predominant as seen from other reflections. We note the strong difference in lineshape between educt and product. 0.37 at 650 K. This texture effect is interpreted to be the result of hercynite-rich magnetite portions which form disperse aluminium oxides in the last step of reduction (an observation which corresponds to measurements done by the group of Hosemann et al. [11] and Borghard and Boudart [12]); and these portions are the same which form the difficult-to-reduce ternary oxides detected with bulk and surface sensitive techniques such as M6ssbauer spectroscopy [13], X-ray diffraction [12], SIMS [17], and photoemission [29]. At the marked position (#) in the diffraction pattern in Fig. 3 a broad weak reflection occurs under the magnetite (400) peak. It disappears gradually with the conversion of magnetite to iron and does not follow in its intensity evolution the changes observed with the magnetite reflection. This allows to conclude that the reflection belongs to an intermediate phase during activation. In Refs. [3] and [19-21] this intermediate reflection was also observed and attributed to a second wuestite phase with different composition than the initial phase. Then the reflection would be the wuestite (200) peak which occurs, however, significantly displaced relative to its expected position. On the other hand, in a recent MiSssbauer study it was found that a stabilised form of wuestite was present as reaction intermediate as long as magnetite could be observed. As an alternative, the broad reflection can be assigned without any positional problem to the most intense peak of a nitride phase namely to Fe~0_~sN. This compound is an intercalation nitride, a family of compounds from which the well-known FeaN is the nitrogen-rich final member. The nitride would be Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 79 formed from small amounts of ammonia formed on the initially present iron particles. Its disappearance at the end of the activation reaction indicates that the intercalated nitrogen atoms are consumed by the much increased turnover on the fully activated catalyst. It is mentioned that this explanation for the additional reflection may also be compatible with the MiSssbauer spectra as the sub-nitride may well exhibit spectral parameters similar to the non-stoichiometric wuestite. Fig. 4 illustrates the absence of any Ostwald ripening during the activation procedure as the linewidth of the first detected iron particles stays the same until all precursor material is converted to iron. It is noted that activation at more severe conditions (faster heating rate, less water in the exit gas) will lead to progressively smaller particles down to about 30 nm in apparent size with, however, the same absence of any growth of the crystals during activation. Only when all diffracted intensity from the precursor phase had disappeared (at 670 K), the production of ammonia was detectable in the mass spectrum at 15 amu. This clearly indicates that the catalytic activity in \"ammonia iron\" does not scale with the bulk iron content, but develops only at the very end of the activation process. The observation is in line with the evolution of the BET surface area [4] and the formation of the metallic surface [3] at reduction degrees above 90%. Either a transformation of the initially formed iron into the active state or surface poisoning of the iron by the still present water from other reaction fronts in the gas phase can explain this finding. Fig. 5 summarises the evolution of diffracted intensities of three main iron reflections with increasing temperature. The measurements were performed in the temperature scanning mode with delay times of 15 h for each temperature. The results may be distorted from these long delays necessary to obtain suitable counting statistics as it is unknown to which extent the reaction was progressing during the delay times. In short-term pilot experiments no time effects were detected. The top panels show the evolution of the (200) and (220) intensities and profiles. The intensities of the higher indexed reflections are too weak and their shape is too diffuse compared to that of the (110) profile to allow an analysis towards a possible anisotropic morphology. The bottom panel reveals the evolution of the iron (110) base reflection and the discontinuous changes in intensities for two magnetite reflections (400) and (311). At the end of the reduction the intensity ratio of the first three iron reflections (110), (200) and (220) is 100 : 10 : 16, while the ratio should be 100 : 20 : 30 for isotropic c~-iron. The value of the (200)/(110) ratio is changed from 0.2 to 0.08 which is an indication for a significant anisotropy of the activated iron particles. The non-simultaneous evolution of the iron diffracted intensity in different orientations with temperature is an obvious sign of the non-isotropic nature of the activated catalyst. A numerical analysis of the integrated intensity changes displayed in Fig. 5 is given in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a reveals that the formation of the active phase is not terminated with the disappearance of the diffracted intensity from the precursor 80 Bernhar Her~.og et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 Fe(110) Fe(110) Fe(200) Fe(211) 42 44 46 60 64 68 40 45 o2e Fe(11 O) ~- -=~~ 675 67O 650 \"--\"~ ~'11V 645 Fe O,(400) ~T ~2 36 40 44 02,) Fig. 5. Course of reduction of the magnetite precursor and formation of the anisotropic \"ammonia iron\". The upper diagrams prove the anisotropic formation of the c~-iron. 17% of the iron diffracted intensity develops only after all intensity from magnetite has disappeared. The final portions of magnetite are enriched in alumina and its exsolution causes a structurally damaged magnetite matrix to remain the final reservoir of educt which is invisible to the X-ray beam. The presence of iron-bearing material which is invisible to the X-rays is further indicated by the change of the sum of the oxide and iron diffracted intensity. At low temperatures the generation of iron from an amorphous source (metastable dispersed wuestite) is observed whereas the various processes acting on the magnetite crystals lead to a significant formation of X-ray invisible material which recrystallises at the very end of the reduction process. The anisotropy of the elemental iron can be seen from the deviations of the measured intensities of the Fe(211) reflection from the theoretical intensity calculated from the intensity of the Fe(110) base reflection. A similar difference was also observed for the Fe(200) reflection. These observations which were made with several batches of catalyst show that the crystallites of the catalyst Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 81 120 '~ 100 ~ 60 ~ 60 z ~ 40 -- 20 a 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 Temperature (K) ,,0 b 120 100 v ~,ffer.e~x5) g6o ~ 60 ~ - ~ 40 ~ 2o (211 ) 0 I I [ I I I i I 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 Temperature (K) Fig. 6.

The small number of reflections observed and the absence of the (111) peak preclude any meaningful prediction of the main dominating crystal termination plane. It may well be that several non-equilibrium orientations do coexist with the sum of all anisotropies being observed in the data of Fig. 6. The detection of this integral anisotropy is a strong hint towards the texture of the iron being a major difference between normal (isotropic) iron and \"ammonia iron\". The reaction mechanism and the qualitative observations about the magnetite transformation can also be quantified by numerical analysis of the disappearing 82 Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 magnetite diffraction pattern. Fig. 7 gives an impression of the textural transfor- mations of the precursor. The hypothetical core-and-shell reduction mechanism should result in a constant intensity at temperatures below the reaction onset and to a smooth decay of the intensity with shrinking core which has to be equal for all crystal orientations. This is clearly not the case in the present reaction. In the low-temperature regime of activation (lower than 620 K) the magnetite reorients itself in an anisotropic way. This is qualitatively in full agreement with recent reports about annealing effects on the reduction kinetics of ammonia synthesis catalysts. The fact that different signs in the intensity changes for two orienta- tionally similar diffracting planes were observed points to a migration of defects and a redistribution of sites in the crystals rather than to a change in the volume distribution of the diffracting crystals. During bulk reduction neither a smooth decay in intensity nor a parallel behaviour for different reflections is seen in Fig. 7. The retarded decay in intensity for the (511) reflection is seen in context with the higher density of iron atoms in this diffraction plane reducing thus their mobility and retarding hence the reaction in this direction in space. For a detailed discussion see below. The inset in Fig. 7 shows the change (in 0.1 pm units, validated by the internal Si standard) of the position of the magnetite reflections with increasing reaction temperature. The behaviour of the (311) reflection follows the expecta- tion of an increase due to thermal expansion of the unit cell. The (511) reflection is first reduced in its d spacing and moves in the expected direction only in the 2OO 150 (31 ) 1311) ~ 50 ' 0 I I I r 300 400 500 600 Reduction Temperature (K) Fig. 7.

Bernhar Herzog et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 83 final stage of reaction. This behaviour is associated with the exsolution of the alumina species from the magnetite as the reaction progress diminishes the oxide volume available for accommodation of the AI3+ ions. The expulsion of the highly charged ions from Fe3+ positions from a solid solution into a separate hercynite phase causes the remaining magnetite to become invisible for X-ray diffraction precluding thus to observe the normalisation of the position of the magnetite (511) reflection. These observations about diffraction anomalies in the magnetite phase are in line with the reaction mechanism sketched above which requires redistribution of cations during chemical reduction. This redistribution manifests itself in the unexpected modification of the diffraction law of the reacting solid. 3.2.

The paracrystallinity factor g = 0.99%, the evolution of line broadening and deviations of the d value for higher indexed reflections (a result of asymmetric broadening) correspond to Hosemann's theory (Hosemann et al. g = 0.73-1.16% [8]; Fischer g = 0.98-1.41%; Borghard and Boudart g = 0.57 [12]). In synthesis gas atmosphere the reflection profiles of the active iron phase differ from symmetric lines of c~-iron expected at the temperatures applied. A close inspection of the reflection profiles with increasing temperature of activa- tion displayed in Fig. 9 reveals that an asymmetric broadening causes the shift of the centre of gravity of the profile giving rise to the paracrystallinity parameters which depend on the temperature of the catalyst. It is important to note that it is possible to detect a change in line profile during activation without having to apply any data analysis. The increase in asymmetry is further inconsistent with an increased ordering of the iron formed as consequence of a thermal and temporal annealing effect (Ostwald ripening) which should lead to a narrower and more symmetric line. Because of the counting statistics a detailed description of this observation is only possible with the (110) reflection, even though higher indexed reflections seem to behave in the same way. Higher indexed reflections show the anomalies more prominent due to their inherent higher resolution as shown in the data of Hosemann et al. [8]. Their acquisition involved, however, film integration techniques with exposure times prohibitive for in situ work. In the 20 region of the Fe(ll0) reflection the diffraction profile function is best defined by a Lorentzian2 (L2) function, as it was verified by analysing the (220) reflection of the Si standard illustrated in Fig. 10.

The data were taken at 650 K in synthesis gas atmosphere. of the X-ray source was considered for the fitting procedure and leads in an unconstrained fit to the typical ratio of 1 : 2 (K oq : K a2). From Fig. 1 la it appears, however, that the L2 function does not fit the (110) profile of the \"ammonia iron\", even when the K a lK a2 splitting is involved. We note the deviation of the asymmetric wings in the profile of the difference pattern (R = 10.33%). This observation is the quantification of the modified line profile seen without data treatment in the high resolution scans of Fig. 9. In Fig. 1 lb it is illustrated that a minimum of three pairs of lines were required to reasonably fit the measured profile (R = 3.68%). The character of a global minimum of this model was checked by testing variations of constraints and starting parameters which all resulted in the same solution. In addition, the response of the profile analysis and the fitted model to changes in the chemical state of the catalyst (see below) which could be achieved without any modification of the specimen geometry by our in situ observation gave consistent results which we take as independent proofs both for the validity of the model and the existence of a correlation between catalytic activity and the details of the average bulk structure. The observed Fe(ll0) profile is a convolution (see Fig. 1 lb) of the normal bulk (110) reflection (d = 204 pm, FWHM = 0.130) and one diffuse reflec- tion at the same position (d = 204 pm, intensity 10% (110), FWHM = 0.640) with a third contribution at a higher d value (d = 204.3 pm, FWHM = 0.25 0). The diffuse reflection at the Fe(ll0) position arises from defective elemental iron giving rise to a wide distribution of interplanar distances and/or small particles of ca. 15 nm diameter, while the main reflection results from bulk iron with a narrow distribution of d spacings and a larger particle size of about 70 86 Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 i i i i i o~ I .jli .......... ~ ,~ ,~11 ~ u e:l uI '~ .~ ~'~.~ I ~ =~ Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 87 nm. The fact that two well-resolved contributions to the total diffracted intensity of alpha-iron exist which is not adequately described by one average peak profile, is proof for a structural inhomogeneity of the iron. Regions of good crystallinity must coexist with parts of much more disordered iron. The reflection at a larger d spacing is attributed to a species of iron with intercalated nitrogen atoms which enlarge the lattice constant. The assignment was verified by changing the synthesis gas atmosphere at isothermal conditions. The material was activated as described above. At 750 K nitrogen was removed from the synthesis gas feed. In certain intervals nitrogen was again supplied and thereafter removed another time. While the integral FWHMs and d spacings of the (110) reflections changed hardly, a systematic variation of the deconvoluted intensities with the presence or absence of nitrogen in the gas phase was clearly detected. Fig. 12 summarises these results which reveal the merit of in situ observations allowing to test the relation between structural inhomogeneity and the chemical environment. Diffraction data were taken for 15 h at each data point of Fig. 12 in either H2 or synthesis gasatmosphere. The overall diffracted intensity remains independent of the atmosphere, but the relative intensities of the contributions change depending on the presence of nitrogen. The contribu- tion from the defective part of metallic iron remains almost unaffected (trace 2 in Fig. 12) whereas the two other contributions react towards the presence of nitrogen in the gas phase (grey blocks in Fig. 12). The lower panel of Fig. 12 compares the percentage contribution of the nitride phase to the ratio between iron and nitride as function of the time on stream. Removal of nitrogen lowers the intensity of the 204.3 pm reflection, and the 204 pm reflections raise. If nitrogen is added, the same process happens vice versa. The formation of the nitride phase occurs rapidly on the time scale of this experiment. The effects caused by nitrogen removal take more time, as the bulk-dissolved nitrogen is only slowly consumed by ammonia synthesis. The response of the system to nitrogen partial pressure changes detected with a bulk sensitive technique is full in line with earlier kinetic observations by Schiitze et al. [4] and allows to rationalise the data from the group of Waugh [18]. The experiments show that the presence of a nitride such as described in earlier investigations [32] is the normal state of the iron catalyst not only as surface nitride but as a phase detectable by X-ray diffraction. The chemical constitution of the nitride will be discussed below. The observation that not all contributions to the iron phases react simultane- ously to the presence of nitrogen suggests further that the activated catalyst consists of several independent structures rather than of one structure with several iron components. The diffraction experiments reveal that the local arrangement of all structures is the same and is identical to normal iron. The long-range order and the texture of the polycrystals seems to be, however, different from normal iron. For this reason no additional phase reflections occur but small effects from the distribution of d spacings on the lineshapes of the 88 Bernhar Herzog et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 100 2 ,\",.--''''. -''''''\" = 80 ~2 c 60 (1) \"0 ........................................................................................ 4o 20 ~ i \"~ / I i I I J i I I I 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 Time on Stream (h) q 3o 30 - I i [] - -~ 13 ~ 25 I It l II I I t , / ', ,, o~ i 1 20 v ~. t , I i \"D 15 \" rS') o - lo -~ i i i o 150 200 250 Time on Stream (h) Fig. 12.

The term \"different structure\" in this context does not indicate an average deviation of the ammonia iron from normal iron on the level of the unit cell structure of bcc iron. The present analysis of the X-ray diffraction effects is in this point fundamentally different from the theory of paracrystallinity which assumed an average devia- tion of the unit cells of ammonia iron and normal iron.

Poisoning of the active catalyst with oxygen. The diagram on the right shows the relative production of ammonia which was detected simultaneously with the XRPD measurements by mass spectroscopy (at 15 amu). Further explication is given in the text. 3.3. Effect of oxygen poisoning on morphology and activity of \"ammonia iron\" Oxygen is known to be a strong poison in the synthesis process of ammonia. Its addition was speculated [18], however, to be beneficial for the reaction when applied under certain conditions. Pulse deactivation experiments with industrial catalysts revealed severe effects for ammonia production [4]. In both sets of experiments a boost of ammonia production with a peak above the equilibrium concentration was observed following a pulse of oxygen which rapidly dimin- ished the catalyst activity. The production of ammonia was even more quickly poisoned by a sequence of 02 pulses. In Fig. 13 diffraction patterns of an in situ deactivation run are presented indicating the severe bulk effects of oxygen poisoning. Some numerical data of these patterns are collected in Table 2 to illustrate the severe bulk structural effects of oxidation at high temperatures.

Right before poisoning, the catalyst iron exhibits its typical texture, (200)/(110) =0.07 (Fig. 13a). During addition of oxygen the formation of magnetite was detected (dashed lines in Fig. 13b corresponding to JCPDS data No. 19-629 for magnetite) despite the presence of a very large excess of molecular hydrogen and of ammonia. This indicates the high affinity of acti- vated iron towards oxygen. In a slow reaction after the oxygen addition hematite, Fe203, (additional dashed lines in Fig. 13c for JCPDS data No. 33-664) is detected. It is assumed that a disproportionation reaction of a ferrous oxide into iron and ferric oxide is the consequence of the formation of a structurally ill-defined additional oxide (e.g. wuestite, see also observations during activation in Fig. 6) to the magnetite phase seen in Fig. 13b, as the disproportionation of magnetite into iron and hematite is not a known reaction in reducing atmosphere. The observation that three phases of iron and iron oxide can coexist under synthesis gas conditions is a further hint towards the existence of several chemically independent structures of iron in the catalyst. After 45 h in reducing atmosphere the catalyst is fully reduced again as seen in Fig. 13e. High resolution scans through the Fe(ll0) reflection are shown in Fig. 14. Before the oxygen treatment the reflection was broad and asymmetric as already discussed with Fig. 9. At the peak of synthesis activity after termination of the oxygen addition the reflection is reduced in intensity but still broad.

Bernhar Herzog et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 91 significantly more symmetric and narrower showing unmistakably that the texture and distribution of iron structures in the catalyst has changed during the oxidation-reduction cycle. Overheating of the catalyst during exothermic oxide formation causes restructuring with the additional consequence that the (200)/(110) ratio is \"normalised\" to its theoretical value of 0.2. Sintering (see data in Table 2) causes the activated material to restructure to isotropic iron with the consequence of irreversible loss of activity. The degree of overheating was estimated from the marked increase of the d values of the iron reflections as displayed in Fig. 15. The Si standard is shown as control experiment to verify the chemical identity of the iron (no lattice expansion due to intercalation of oxygen or nitrogen atoms). The sample temperature is raised about 40 K from 810 to 850 K during oxidation and reduction of part of the iron. The effect of these structural transformations on the production of ammonia can be seen from the simultaneous detection of the m/e = 15 signal by mass spectrometry also shown in Fig. 13. The experiment starts with the normal production of ammonia over the activated catalyst (central line). At time t = 0 h the admission of oxygen was started for 15 h leading to a pronounced increase in production. The timescale of this enhanced production is much longer than in the previous experiments which used larger total surfaces of catalyst. In the present experiment the bulk part of the effect is detected whereas the reactor poisoning experiments merely saw the surface effects [4]. The initial stage of oxidation is characterised by an increase in ammonia production. It may well be that under the overheating and the oxidation process iron particles fracture along their grain boundaries leading to a temporary increase in surface area [33]. This increased surface area initiates the Ostwald ripening of the major part of normal iron which is not adequately protected by the structural promoter spacers.

Additional experiments showed that the oxygen addition effect can be reversible at reaction temperatures, if the catalyst was reactivated after only a short time of poisoning (200 ml air in 5 min). Quick reactivation hinders the restructuring as slow solid state process to occur and preserves the important anisotropy of the \"ammonia iron\" (Table 2). The line profiles represented by their FWHM indicate how the iron particles suffer from the poisoning. The estimated particle size shows a clear enlargement as a consequence of sintering from oxidative treatment. The restructured iron is in its composition not different to the material before the oxidative restructuring but the relative spatial arrangement of the iron structures and their relative abundance has changed as sensed by the (110) line profile. The comparison of the iron line profiles in Fig. 14 with the catalytic performance shown in Fig. 13 demonstrates very clearly the validity of the approach to correlate the small effects on X-ray line profiles with the catalytic function of ammonia iron. It further corroborates again the validity of the deconvolution of the diffracted intensity into different contributions with differ- ent chemical reactivities. A closer inspection of the values in Table 2 reveals that the texture of the iron as expressed by the integral intensity ratio of (200) to (110) seems less significant for the catalytic activity than the line profile which is sensitive to the distribution of different iron structures. This is reflected in the particle size data in Table 2 which correlate in the expected way with the catalytic activity. As we know about the modified lineshapes of the iron a simple correlation of catalytic activity with total particle surface area does not hold. 4. Discussion 4.1. General aspects The present work reports data of an in situ observation of the structure of a catalyst during activation and during steady state performance. Modifications of the gas phase composition had direct effects on both catalytic performance and structural parameters detectable by X-ray diffraction. Most of these observations were possible by direct inspection of the diffraction data which were suitable for detailed numerical evaluation due to the operation with internal Si standards and by careful sample movements avoiding geometrical changes of the diffracting material. Based on several direct observation a numerical deconvolution of the Fe(110) reflection gave clear evidence for the presence of several structures of iron which are all long-range order derivatives of bcc iron unit cells. Three Bernhar Herzog et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 93 detectable components differ in the defect structure of the diffracting volume. A more precise analysis in terms of orientational anisotropy was not possible due to the present constraints in experimental set-up and the in situ observation conditions. The observations leading to the formulation of the paracrystallinity theory were experimentally confirmed. The analysis in the framework of paracrys- tallinity assumed without proof that only one diffracting phase with molecular homogeneity should be present. In the present work evidence was found by the in situ observation of the influence of the gas phase on the crystal structure of the iron that several structures with different diffraction laws coexist in the activated catalyst. Most spectroscopic methods such as electron spectroscopy, MiSssbauer spectroscopy or EXAFS are too local and sense mainly the existence of unperturbed iron bcc unit cells in the catalyst which is also supported from the present study. X-ray diffraction and methods sampling larger volumes of the reciprocal space such as HRTEM reveal the deviations in long-range ordering which are statistical in their origin and give thus no rise to superlattice reflections. The oxygen-induced restructuring experiment which irreversibly modified the disposition of the different structures within the crystals of iron showed clearly that this second-order effects are very relevant for the catalytic action of the activated iron. The observations of the activation process revealed the importance of the solid state kinetics of the complex process of iron oxide reduction on the formation of the different iron structures. It is shown that the simple picture of a core-and-shell reduction process cannot account for the formation of several iron structures and does not describe the phenomenology of the conversion of iron oxides to the metal as seen by the quantitative analysis of the intensity changes of selected reflections. 4.2. The activation process Our experiments describe the course of events from the precursor to the active phase, a reaction which is influenced in its kinetics by the presence of structural promoters [34]. The main findings can be summarised as follows. The precursor material is chemically inhomogeneous and structurally tex- tured resulting from dissolved aluminium oxide, and ferrous oxide inclusions. Of particular importance is the presence of wuestite (FeO) in the precursor material and during the main reduction process. In the first step of reduction the thermal decomposition of wuestite produces isotropic a-iron nuclei which act as reaction centres for the reduction of the magnetite and set up concentration gradients for iron ions in higher valences. The structural promoters are released from a hercynite-magnetite solid solution phase in the end of the activation process giving rise to an 94 Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 inhomogeneous distribution of the exsolution products in the bulk of the catalyst. These exsolution products (either alumina or stoichiometric her- cynite) give stability to the metastable pore system between the iron crystal- lites as they prevent complete contact between the iron particles and hence inhibit Ostwald ripening. The increasing texture of the magnetite phase during activation indicates the formation of non-isotropic iron and documents the mode of operation of a topotactically (spatially anisotropic) controlled reaction kinetics. This kinetics does, however, not reproduce the topography of the precursor oxides as the transportation of all constituting iron ions along low-energy pathways which may not coincide with grain boundaries, is required for the reaction. The reaction kinetics cannot be described by a core-and-shell model [35,34] which would leave the grain structure of the precursor oxide unchanged in the resulting iron metal. Also a modification, the crackling core-and-shell model does not describe the defined and very pronounced change in texture from the oxide to the metal. We observe a restructuring process controlled by the iron ion transport. These findings explain the correct representation of the catalyst synthesis by model experiments with alumina-promoted single crys- tals of (100) and (110) orientations which were activated by an oxidation-re- duction cycle into (111) iron [36]. While topotactic reduction should lead to isotropic dense materials as it is observed for metallurgical magnetite test specimen [37], the active catalyst consists of firmly adhering iron with a defined pore system. The catalyst may be represented by a spongy texture of iron with metallic contacts between the basic structural units giving the whole arrangement a high mechanical stability. From Figs. 6 and 7 it was concluded that the reaction may follow a different route for the promoted catalyst oxide than for metallurgical magnetite. The strong texture of the magnetite precursor which becomes even more pronounced during the activation process offers special directions for the reaction to proceed. While for example the material is preferentially consumed along the (311) plane, (gradu- ally decreasing intensity of the Fe304(311) reflection), the (511) planes seem to act as a substrate for the growth of the anisotropic iron platelets. Fig. 16 displays the different arrangements of iron atoms in both planes. In the (311) plane the atoms are packed more densely than in the (511) plane which may act as transport routes for iron ions. The changing anisotropy of the reacting magnetite crystals indicates that no uniform and isotropic reduction of the precursor occurs and therefore no topotactically related iron particles are formed. The most obvious sign for that is the different lineshape for educt and product displayed in Fig. 4. It is know that under precisely controlled conditions such reaction modes as described above may occur in iron oxide materials. Ettabirou et al. [37] and Gleitzer [38] showed that there is a competition in growth rate between the surface reaction rate and the diffusion of point defects (interstitial iron atoms) along semi-coherent Bernhar Herzog et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 95 4HIIIIHIII Q4~II4~IIIIINII4HI 00 IOIIIIN~IIO IIIINII4NI 4NIIIOOIIe4~IOe4~IIIIO IINI OO IOIOIOOOIO IIIO4JIH OOOOOOOO 80000000000000 IO OOIIOOOOOO IOOOOOOO 4~IIIOHIIII4~IIaHIIIIIHI OO OOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOIHD 80000000 OOOOOO00OOOIHIO OOIOOO4J4IOO OIOOOO84D HI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OO OOOOOIHOOOO OOOOOOIHD OOOOOO00 OOOOO000OOm~410 I n~ un d/nIp' ,I,,III, IO O O ~ O O O ~ m ID ~ ImlmI, ID m ~ O O 10 O O 0 0 80 0 OIOII IO 0008000 00800 O0 ID O O0 nJ Io ID gi o o gi o o o o ii o ii 1if ii iii o ii o o o o o 0 0 80 0 0 9mnb II 0 m ~ I eI O I II O O O I qI I UO 4IO OI II II II Fig. 16.

Gleitzer introduced a fundamental model for the reaction mechanism [38] which we expand to the formation of the textured iron particles of the ammonia catalyst: Fig. 17 schematically summarises the proposed reactions, the principal mass transport paths, and transformations resulting in the formation of iron lamellae. The principle behind this unusual growth mode of lamellae is the minimisation of the interfacial energy in selected directions allowing structural accommodation and providing glide planes for the iron ions. In this respect epitaxial relationships between iron and magnetite or iron and wuestite are of importance.

From Gleitzer's findings in Ref. [38] it can also be rationalised why it was impossible [34] to distinguish between the two morphological models (core-and-shell and lamellae growth) from kinetic features as both time laws are very similar. Only the combination of reduction potential, temperature and reaction rate (hindered by promoter addition) selects between core-and-shell mode and lamellae mode. Ammonia iron is thus a material in which at least core-and-shell grown normal iron and lamellar iron coexist with each other. Other forms of iron particles controlled by suitable epitactic relationships between oxide and metal as they are mentioned in Gleitzers review [38] may also be present in reduced ammonia iron. Only microscopic analysis could reveal the exact arrangement and relative proportions of the different structures. As these structures differ in the distribution of surface orientation and ammonia synthesis is a structure sensitive reaction, a close correlation exists between catalytic activity (a surface phenomenon) and struc- tural inventory of the iron (which is a bulk structural effect). 4.3. The structure of the acticated catalyst The basis for the following discussion is a schematic representation [39] of the main structural features of the technical catalyst derived from a variety of Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 97 analytical data. The basic idea was that the structure of the active \"ammonia iron\" is predetermined in the structure of the grains of the oxide mixture. The formed iron particles are separated by a pore system, which increases the active surface of the catalyst and which stabilises anisotropic metastable alpha-iron platelets against sintering by spacers of structural promoter oxides. The thermo- dynamically unfavourable texture of the platelets results in an (111) orientation of the basal planes [40,41], which is known to be very active in the synthesis of ammonia [42,43]. This conjecture of a uniform structure was used in all models of the activated iron catalyst. The heterogeneity of the material was always confined to the composition of iron metal and various oxidic promoter phases. The present findings can be summarised in a model in which an explanation is attempted for the experimental observations of Hosemann et al. The model takes into account the definitive exclusion [3] of endotactic epitaxy [8] as cause for the anomalies. In addition, it should explain, why \"ammonia iron\" is different in its catalytic action from normal iron. The presence of a preferential orientation in the technical system is the basis for the success of the \"single crystal approach\" in resolving the mechanism of ammonia synthesis on an atomic scale [44,45]. This fact is further the explana- tion for the at present unique bridge [7,46] between UHV studies [47] and high pressure experiments [48]. We propose that \"ammonia iron\" is also heterogeneous in the structure of the iron. It is suggested that the diffraction anomalies observed on the bcc iron pattern for ammonia iron are explained by the coexistence of several species of iron crystals which are characterised by different crystal shapes and by different defect structures. Typical defect structures are stacking faults and their ordering and the incorporation of atoms like nitrogen in interstitial sites. Both effects lead to deviations in the exact d spacing of the diffracting planes from which only the (110) orientation was accessible in the present work. Would the defects be present in a defined relative arrangement (ordering) additional reflections due to symmetry lowering of the iron lattice would occur. The complete absence of such a defect ordering leads to a statistical distribution of d spacings with the statistics representing the statistics of the defect ordering. The observed devia- tion in intensity distribution indicates that the basic structural units are not all isotropic. If several types of anisotropic basic structural units coexist or if one type (e.g. platelets) coexist with isotropic basic structural units cannot be decided without additional information. A more complete analysis would require the application of a shorter wavelength such as Mo radiation which was not possible to apply with our presently existing equipment. A spatial anisotropy of the line profile could be used to discriminate these two possibilities. The lineshape of the (110) reflection was used to extract information about two contributions with different d spacing distributions than the main reflection. If the quantitative information from Figs. 6 and 12 are compared we can conclude that the main contribution arises from isotropic bcc iron with no 98 Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 significant texture and sizes of the basic structural units of about 70 nm near the instrumental resolution limit. This main part of the material is in nothing different from normal iron and can hardly constitute the active phase of the catalyst. The two other components to the (110) reflection contribute significantly less to the (211) reflection and almost nothing to the (200) reflection and are thus considered as highly anisotropic platelets or dendrites (provided that the inten- sity assignment to the main contribution is correct). The surface normal of the anisotropic structures is thus not parallel to [100]. The internal perfection of one structure is very poor giving rise to an apparent or real small particle size with the centre of the d spacing distribution being at the position of normal bcc iron. We assign a structure of defective iron to it. In the gas phase modification experiments (nitriding and oxidation) the structure was little affected pointing towards a high chemical stability. As interstitial atoms stabilising the defective structure should somewhat affect the d spacing we prefer to assign an internal location within the iron grains to this structure. If the structure is completely surrounded by other compact material it cannot react with different gases and does hence not react to chemical changes in the environment. The internal perfection of the other structure is comparable to that of the main structure but the average d spacing is slightly enlarged. This points to the presence of interstitial atoms. As the abundance of this structure is strongly correlated to the presence of nitrogen in the gas phase (see Fig. 12) we assign an interstitial nitride to this structure. It is pointed out that this analysis is rather crude and more sophisticated methods using Fourier analysis of the line profile do exist. They can, however, only give more reliable information if at least one other reflection with the same quality of counting statistics is available for analysis which is, unfortunately not the case in the present work. For this reason the structural assignment has to remain incomplete at the time and several other structures as suggested in the recent electron microscopy study may well hide behind the complex peak profile which gave rise to the historical paracrystallinity theory. The detection of a distribution of d spacings over a considerable extent (from about 206.6 to 201 pm according to the data in Fig. 9) has further implications on the mechanism of nitrogen dissociation. A recent publication gave evidence that regions of high strain and defect density have a strong influence on the activation of molecular nitrogen [49]. Strained Fe(110) on W(110) proved to be very reactive in the N2 activation and dissociation even at low temperatures. This could imply that the conditions for the structure sensitive nitrogen dissocia- tion found with high-quality unstrained single crystals could also be fulfilled on strained and defective surfaces with other nominal orientations than (111) and (211) irrespective of the presence of alkali promoter species which are known to lift the structure sensitivity. In this way the abundance of the structure with a Bernhar Herzog et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 99 high deviation from the bulk Fe(ll0) d spacing could correlate with the catalytic activity even if the main surface orientation of this structure is unknown or not in the directions found suitable with single crystals. In situ diffraction experiments further showed the severe structural conse- quences of limited oxygen poisoning which is not only a surface phenomenon but creates a sequence of bulk reactions. The presence of oxygen leads to a sustained deactivation of the catalyst starting with the formation of isotropic magnetite. This early stage of deactivation causes a marked increase of ammonia production when the surface is enlarged by oxidative etching of the iron grains [3] and nitrogen stored in the iron bulk is released from the overheating caused by the initial oxidation reaction. Addition of oxygen was thought to be a beneficial effect for the synthesis process but the combination of in situ XRPD and reaction monitoring shows that this is only the consequence of a short-term observation [18] of the beginning decomposition of the active phase which is followed by a sustained decreased performance of the catalyst. The exothermic oxide formation also damages the active iron by overheating, which causes sintering of the iron particles. As a consequence inactive a-iron is formed, which is clearly detected in the in situ diffraction pattern (Fig. 14) which also reveals a partial loss of the additional iron structures. These structural observations are in parallel to the changes in the level of catalytic performance shown in Fig. 13. The effects of oxygen poisoning can be eliminated, if the material is quickly reactivated. The typical texture can only in part be restored classifying the poisoning as a structurally irreversible process. 4.4. The structure of the nitride phase The part of the iron structure which changed its abundance in parallel with the nitrogen partial pressure in the synthesis gas atmosphere was associated with a nitride phase. Nitrides of the form Fe4N were already discussed as surface compounds in the literature. It was pointed out that they should be thermody- namically metastable as bulk phase due to the enormous partial pressure of dinitrogen which would be required for their stable formation. On the other hand, the iron-nitrogen phase diagram which was established in the presence of one atmosphere of ammonia shows Fe4N to be stable at the temperatures of technical ammonia synthesis. As under these conditions one atmosphere of ammonia is certainly present in the gas phase over the catalyst, Fe4N could well be the stable form of iron under technical synthesis conditions. We failed to observe the X-ray diffraction pattern of Fe4N in our in situ experiments which is not surprising as we never reached one atmosphere of ammonia during the in situ experiments. Thus, the nitride phase detected here must be of a different structure than Fe4N. The crystal structure of Fe4N is a nitrogen-rich member of a large family of 100 Bernhar Herzog et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 141 (1996) 71 104 intercalation nitrides. Their building principle is to occupy octahedral intersti- tials with nitrogen atoms. As a consequence of the oversize of the nitrogen atom for a octahedral void in iron tetragonal distortions or at least significant lattice strain occurs. Intercalation will reduce in any case the symmetry of the iron lattice giving rise to additional reflections in the diffraction pattern. As the number of octahedral interstices is as large as the number of iron atoms in the unit cell there will be always many more interstitial sites than intercalated atoms. A large variety of ordering patterns and of course a high probability of disorder will result. This means that iron can take up any number of nitrogen atoms from zero to FeaN without a significant structural effect. For fully ordered structures the effects on the powder diffraction pattern have been simulated for isotropic particles.

Our present diffraction conditions and isotropic particles of 80 nm size were assumed. Bernhar Herzog et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 101 scans around the Fe(ll0) reflection. For Fe4N the pattern is significantly different from that of bcc iron and would immediately be recognisable. The phase lowest in nitrogen content which crystallises in an ordered structure is Fel0 18N. For this phase the diffraction pattern is already quite similar to that of iron. If we assume a 25% contribution of this nitride the only consequence would be a small peak at higher angles of the iron (110) reflection. This situation resembles already the situation observed in Figs. 9-12. The distance between the two peaks is given by the tetragonal distortion of the iron lattice due to the filling of interstices. This is illustrated in Fig. 19 where all possible interstitial sites in bcc iron are shown. It is seen that the iron atoms are no longer in close contact in order to accommodate the nitrogen atoms. Statistically only about 5% of each site is occupied for the nominal composition. If this value is further reduced the deviation in the lattice constant from that of pure iron will gradually disappear and a distribution of nitrogen atoms along a concentration gradient from the surface into the bulk will produce a distribution of d spacings very much so as observed experimentally. The top view in Fig. 19 reveals that the nitrogen atoms form zigzag chains in the (111) projection of the structure which is at this accuracy indistinguishable of that of pure iron (111). This view further illustrates how easy the two structures fit into each other allowing thus any intermixing of the two phases as determined by the virtual pressure of Felo_18N unit cell 1 4/m m m v t .1 Felo_lsN (111) Fig. 19.

All nitrogen positions (black) are only statistically occupied (see text). 102 Bernhar Herz, og et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 71-104 nitrogen atoms. The nature of the nitride phase is in summary determined by the virtual pressure of nitrogen atoms and the high angle shoulder of the Fe(110) reflection will become the more pronounced the higher was the pressure of nitrogen atoms in the form of e.g. dissociating ammonia. Unfortunately, this shoulder will not be observable in ex situ experiments as the necessary oxygen passivation will remove most of the bulk-dissolved nitrogen atoms as illustrated with the oxygen poisoning experiment. 5. Conclusion The microstructural analysis of formation and active state of the industrial iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis has given a new explanation of the old finding about the powder diffraction anomalies. A main new finding concerns the structural inhomogeneity of the iron which is present in several types of basic structural units differing in shape and internal degree of ordering of bcc unit cells which are common to all forms of iron. The analysis revealed one reason for the success of the single crystal approach in explaining the mode of operation on a quantitative basis. The model compound Fe(111) saturated with atomic nitrogen finds its parallel in the technical system by a fraction of anisotropic iron part of which reacts readily with nitrogen to form intercalation nitrides. The main body of the technical catalyst is, however, normal isotropic iron. The non-equilibrium (under ambient conditions) microstructure arises from a combination of a uniquely metastable mixture of precursor oxides and an activation kinetics allowing the topotactic reaction dictated by the iron ion diffusion to control the microstructure of the activated product. The promoters play an essential role not only in stabilising the final structure but also in ascertaining a slow reaction progress in a highly reducing chemical environ- ment. The technologically undesirable fact of a slow activation is the key to the formation of the catalytically relevant minority volume fraction with an unusual microstructure. It remains an open question whether the nitride phase which is the stable form of elemental iron in ammonia atmosphere at elevated temperature is just an unavoidable consequence of thermodynamics or if it affects the course of the catalytic reaction.

Tel. (+49-30) 84134400, fax. (+49-30) 84134401 The formation of the iron species catalysing the synthesis of ammonia was followed by in situ X-ray powder diffraction. It was shown that a complex sequence of reactions during the activation process (reduction of the magnetite precursor) leads to a metastable form of α-iron. A detailed examination of the diffraction lines of iron helped to elucidate the question, why “ammonia iron” is so much superior to “normal iron”. Unusual line profiles were observed which could be controlled by changing the reaction conditions. Platelet crystallites of defective alpha-iron form the outer shell of isotropic bulk iron particles which represent the main body of the catalyst material. A shoulder at higher d values of the Fe(110) reflection points to the formation of an iron/nitrogen phase during catalytic action. The crystallographic observations are in line with previous data on paracrystallinity, but their interpretation is of a different nature. The structural effects of oxygen poisoning were investigated. It is shown, why the poisoning is detrimental for the catalytic performance and how the speculation could arise that this effect may be beneficial for the reaction.

        "dc:description": "The formation of the iron species catalysing the synthesis of ammonia was followed by in situ X-ray powder diffraction. It was shown that a complex sequence of reactions during the activation process (reduction of the magnetite precursor) leads to a metastable form of α-iron. A detailed examination of the diffraction lines of iron helped to elucidate the question, why “ammonia iron” is so much superior to “normal iron”. Unusual line profiles were observed which could be controlled by changing the reaction conditions. Platelet crystallites of defective alpha-iron form the outer shell of isotropic bulk iron particles which represent the main body of the catalyst material. A shoulder at higher d values of the Fe(110) reflection points to the formation of an iron/nitrogen phase during catalytic action. The crystallographic observations are in line with previous data on paracrystallinity, but their interpretation is of a different nature. The structural effects of oxygen poisoning were investigated. It is shown, why the poisoning is detrimental for the catalytic performance and how the speculation could arise that this effect may be beneficial for the reaction.",
