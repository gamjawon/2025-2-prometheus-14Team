Lombardo * lnstituto de lnvestigaciones en Catrlisis y Petroqufmica 1NCAPE (FIQ, UNL -- CONICET), Santiago del Estero 2829, 3000 Santa Fe, Argentina Received 1 November 1994; revised 27 February 1995; accepted 27 February 1995 Abstract The oxidation states of vanadium on the surface of VPO catalysts which show the characteristic diffraction pattern of vanadyl pyrophosphate have been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy (XPS). The (VO)2P207 phase is obtained from crystalline precursors which show the X- ray pattern of VOHPO4.1/2H20. The XPS spectra of 40 solids (precursors, catalysts, and model compounds) hinted the presence of low concentrations of Vv centers on the surface of the bulk Vjv catalysts. To further investigate this matter, the solids were oxidized or reduced in a pretreatment chamber attached to the spectrometer. These studies confirmed the presence of Vv centers on the surface of the catalysts which may be initiated by strong oxygen chemisorption on exposed VTM sites of (VO)2P207. It is also shown that the presence of excess phosphorus prevents the oxidation of the surface (and the bulk) to/~-VOPO4, a phase which has a deleterious effect on catalyst performance.

Introduction Vanadium-phosphorus oxides (VPO) are industrially used to catalyze the selec- tive oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. The solid-state chemistry of this system is characterized by a large number of crystalline phases containing vanadium in different oxidation states which are interconverted in the presence of different gases [ 1 ]. These gas-assisted solid state reactions occur over several hundred hours and the so-called equilibrated catalyst is obtained after this period on stream [ 2]. * Corresponding author.

Lombardo /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 125-138 Industrial catalysts which have been on stream for several thousand hours show the characteristic diffraction pattern of a well-crystallized vanadyl pyrophosphate [ 3,4 ]. However, through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopies small but detectable amounts of Vv compounds have been found in used laboratory catalysts [5]. In view of these findings, it has been claimed that the catalysts' surface is made up of micro-domains of (VO)2P207 and y-VOPO4, [ vIV-vv] couple. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to determine the oxi- dation state of vanadium on the surface of different compounds [6-8]. Only few XPS measurements have been reported on the VPO system [9-18]. Data belonging to monophasic solids have been collected in Table 1. Note that only in a few cases are data for the three elements provided with almost no reference to peak width being made. The reported V 2p3/2 binding energies in the vanadyl pyrophosphate (P/V = 1.0) goes from 516.6 to 517.9 eV. This may be due to either the presence of surface and/or bulk impurity phases, or errors in the correction of sample charge. Regarding the latter, most authors took C 1 s as a reference with values between 284.5 and 285 eV. A most important source of error is, however, the presence of carbon residues coming either from the preparation method or from carbonaceous moieties formed during reaction yielding a broad C 1 s signal whose binding energy (BE) is undetermined. In view of this difficulty a better criterion [ 11] to differ- entiate the vanadium oxidation state may be the difference in BE between O 1 s and V 2p3/2 ( A o Is -- V 2p) which has been calculated by us, when possible, and included Table 1 Published XPS data of VPO compoundsa Solid (P/V)boLk V 2p3/2 O ls P 2p Ao ~ v 2pb Ref.

This BE difference is 14.5 _0.1 eV for the VTM containing phase (P/V = 1.0) and 13.0 (with one exception) for the/~-VOPO4. This criterion will be revisited when our results are presented (vide infra). Table 1 also shows data in which excess phosphorus was present in the solid. These data are interesting as commercial catalysts usually contain excess phospho- rus which is said to improve selectivity [3]. Wening and Schrader [ 18] did not report changes in BE when the P/V ratio of VOHPO4- 1/2H20 was varied between 1 and 1.2 and the same was true for their used catalyst exclusively containing vanadyl pyrophosphate. By varying the P/V ratio over an extended range (0.5- 3.0) there appeared other phases besides (VO)2P207 [ 14] but the general trend observed was the surface reduction of vanadium with increasing ratios and the shift of the O I s signal to higher BE. Based upon this limited and somewhat contradictory data all the authors con- cluded, including us in two previous communications [ 2,19 ], that VTM was the only vanadium species present on the surface of vanadyl pyrophosphate. In view of the incompleteness of the available surface data and the information coming from NMR and Raman spectroscopies, albeit not surface sensitive tech- niques, we decided to investigate using XPS the presence of Vv species on the surface of equilibrated catalysts and model compounds. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of model compounds and catalysts (VO)2P207 and catalysts The precursor (VOHP04- 1/2H20) is dehydrated to (VO)2P207 at ca. 650 K. The vanadyl hydrogen phosphate hemihydrate may be prepared from V205 either in aqueous or organic solvent. Aqueous solvent Five grams of V205 were reduced with 75 ml of 37% hydrochloric acid under refux for three hours. H3PO4 (85%) was then added in the desired amount and the solution re fluxed for another two hours [ 20 ]. After evaporation, the solid was dried at 383 K in air for 24 h. The precursors were heated at 690 K in flowing nitrogen for three hours. Organic medium Two kinds of organic preparations are reported here. They differ in the first step, the dissolution and reduction of the oxide, as follows: (i) A mixture of benzyl and isobutyl alcohols was used; (ii) the isobutyl was replaced by isopropyl alcohol. In both cases, 5 g of V205 were refluxed for three hours in one of the above mixtures, according to the procedure of Katsumoto and Marquis [ 21 ]. Orthophosphoric acid 128 L,M. Cornaglia, E.A. Lombardo / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 125-138 (100%) was then added and the solution refluxed for two hours. From a previous work [2], ca. 10% excess of acid was needed to obtain the desired P/V ratio in the solid. The suspension obtained was filtered and the solid dried at 423 K in air for 24 h. Catalyst activation The aqueous and organic preparations were pretreated differently. The aqueous solids were heated in air up to 630 K where the reactant mixture ( 1.5% C4 in air) flow was started. The organic formulations were activated following two different procedures. In both cases, the precursor was heated in air up to 630 K at which point the reactants were injected. The C4 concentration and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) were increased in several steps. In fast activation, the precursor was heated in the reactant mixture ( 1% C4 in air) up to 670 K. More details have been given elsewhere [2]. The equilibrated catalysts are those which did not show any chgnges in catalytic performance at GHSV = 2500 h t and 1.5% n-butane concentration for at least 50 h after finishing the activation period. The organic solids which were fast activated and in general those which do not comply with the above condition are called non- equilibrated catalysts. 2.2. Compounds ~-VOP04 This phase was obtained by starting from an aqueous precursor with stoichio- metric P/V ratio which was heated in flowing oxygen at 773 K for 10 h. O~lrVOP04 An organic precursor (P/V = 1.26) was heated at 553 K in flowing air for 72 h to obtain the characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of this phase. '-phase The same type of organic precursor (P/V = 1.26) was heated at 773 K in flowing oxygen during 10 h. 2.3. Characterization X-ray diffraction The measurements were made with a Rich-Seifert Iso-Debyeflex 2002 instru- ment, using Cu Kce radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The XPS measurements of all samples were carried out using an ESCA750 Shimadzu electron spectrometer. Non-monochromatic Mg Ko~ X-ray radiation was used. The anode was operated at 8 kV and 30 mA and the pressure in the analysis chamber was about 2.10-6 Pa. L.M. Cornaglia, E.A. Lombardo /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 125-138 129 The data were collected and analyzed using an ESCAPAC 760 computer inter- faced to the spectrometer. Before the position of the peaks was determined, a linear background subtraction was performed. The binding energies were referred to the C ls signal (284.6 eV). When a broad C ls signal was obtained, the P 2p BE was taken as reference, as indicated. Peak synthesis was made using Gaussian-Lorentzian components. Account has been taken of the presence of K,~3 and Ks4 spectral lines of the large O 1 s signal [22]. These satellite peaks are 8.4 and 10.2 eV down-shifted from the O ls main peak and overlap with the V 2pl/2 signal. Since the resolution of the V 2pl/2 is poorer than that of the V 2p3/2 level due to the overlapping of four signals, we preferably used the latter BEs and widths for comparison with literature data (Tables 1-3 and 5). Additional data for curve fitting of the V 2p doublets include: (i) Spin-orbit separation 7.2 eV, (ii) V 2pl/JV 2p3/2 intensity ratio 0.5, (iii) Full width at half-maximum (FWHM) were taken as 1.7 eV for Vv (measured in/3- VOPO4) and 2.0 eV for VTM (measured in VOHPO4\" 1/2H20). The (O/V)s and (P/V)s atomic ratios were calculated using the areas under O 1 s and the phosphorus and vanadium 2p peaks, the Scofield photoionization cross- sections, the mean free paths of the electrons and the instrumental function which was given by the ESCA manufacturer. The sample was mounted on a high-temperature probe using silver painting. The reported temperature was always measured using the thermocouple located inside the probe under the sample. To estimate the error in temperature values, the probe was heated between 600 and 800 K, and the temperature measured with two thermocouples: one inside the probe and another in contact with the exposed sample surface. The maximum difference in temperature between the thermocouples was 5K. The spectra were recorded at room temperature. Selected samples were trans- ferred to a reaction chamber directly attached to the ESCA spectrometer and were heated at varying temperatures in different gases such as 02, H2, N2 or Ar. The 0.5 dm3 stainless steel reaction chamber is connected to a gas manifold and may be evacuated with a mechanical pump (10-1 Pa). The gases used in the different treatments were always loaded at atmospheric pressure (295 K). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalysts and model compounds Table 2 shows XPS data of pure compounds as well as precursors and catalysts which show monophasic X-ray diffraction patterns. Out of 19 catalysts, four were non-equilibrated solids. No significant difference was observed between their spec- tra and those of equilibrated catalysts. The C 1 s signal at 284.6 eV was taken as reference except in those cases in which a broad peak was observed. In such cases, 130 L.M. Cornaglia, E.A.

The pure compounds' data are used to identify the possible changes occurring at the surface of catalysts and other solids after being in contact with the reactant stream or in contact with different gases at varying temperatures. The reliability of our data was checked for (VO)2P207 and/~-VOPO4 in another instrument, obtain- ing an excellent agreement both in BEs and peak widths (Table 2, rows 3 and 5). Another important piece of information obtained from the analysis of the XPS data is the catalyst surface phosphorus enrichment observed both by other research group and by us [2,11,12,22]. We have previously shown the variation of (P/V)s vs. (P/V)B in fresh and equilibrated catalysts obtained using either aqueous or organic methods [2]. The aqueous preparations show higher phosphorus enrich- ment than the organic ones. In all cases the surface enrichment significantly increases with time on stream. The results obtained with the larger number of samples studied here confirm the data reported with more detail in ref. [2]. L.M. Cornaglia, E.A. Lombardo /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 125-138 131 As mentioned in the Section 1, many catalysts showing monophasic diffraction patterns of vanadyl pyrophosphate contain small amounts of Vv phases revealed by NMR [22] and Raman spectroscopies [ 12]. Do the XPS data shown in Table 2 reveal the presence of Vv on the surface of catalysts? Note that 35 samples of precursors, catalysts and model VTM compounds show a constant O ls BE of 532.2 ___ 0.1 eV. The FWHM of the oxygen signal also shows small variations between 2.8 and 3.1 eV with only one exception, the pure (VO)2P207, which yields a narrower signal (2.5 eV). The pure Vv phases with and without phosphorus exhibit much narrower O ls signals ( 1.7-2.0 eV), shifted downwards to 531.2 (/3-VOPO4) and 530.0 eV (V205). The vanadyl hydrogen phosphate hemihydrate shows a V 2p3/2 binding energy of 517.5 eV which should correspond to VTM in this oxide matrix. However, the V 2p signal of vanadyl pyrophosphate appears at 517.9 eV and in used organic catalysts at 517.8 eV. This displacement towards higher BE may be due to either a different vanadium environment or to the coexistence of VTM and Vv on the surface. The latter hypothesis may be supported by the increasing width of the signal (2.4 eV vs. 2.0 eV) followed by a significant decrease in the pure Vv phase. Garbassi et al. [11] used the difference in BEs of O ls-V 2p3/2 to determine the oxidation state of vanadium on the surface of vanadyl phosphate and of other solids containing mixtures of VPO phases. They reported a variation of this differ- ence between 14.2 eV and 13.0 eV when the solids were calcined at increasing temperatures between 473 K and 773 K. The last column of Table 2 shows these differences in BEs for our samples. Note that the pure VTM phase VOHPO4\" 1/2H20 shows a Ao ls-v2v = 14.7 eV while the Vv containing/3-VOPO4 and V205 phases yield Ao 1s v 2p = 12.9 eV. The A values for (VO)2P207 (P/V = 1.0) are slightly smaller than those found in VOHPO4\" 1/2H20 (Table 2). A similar con- clusion may be reached from the sixth column of Table 1 covering data from several labs. The A values for the catalysts with P/V > 1.0 do not differ, however, from those measured for the VOHPO4\" 1/2H20 (Table 2). To double-check the data obtained with our spectrometer one of us took a couple of samples to the Surface Science Center at the University of Pittsburgh. The data obtained with their instrument were essentially the same as ours (Table 2). The/3' phase which contains a mixture of VTM and Vv centers in the bulk and the pure Vv aii phase show almost identical binding energies of v~V-vv signals. These data will be useful in the identification of phases which appear during the oxidation of VPO solids (vide infra). Note that the vanadium pentoxide gives a very sharp spectrum with narrow O is and V 2p3/2 signals. Although the A value is identical to/3-VOPO4 the V 2p3/2 signal has been shifted 1.1 eV. This may be understood in terms of the higher electronegativity of phosphorus which diminishes the electronic density on the Vv. Besides, the V 2p3/2 peak tails off on the low BE side. This may be due to the presence of small amounts of VTM sites originating from self-reduction in the analysis chamber [ 19]. 132 L.M. Cornaglia, E.A. Lombardo /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 125-138 In view of the above observation, the stability of each group of samples against X-ray radiation was checked. To do this, spectra were taken 8 and 80 rain after introduction of the sample into the analysis chamber. No difference was detected between these spectra. Note as well the high reproducibility of the V 2p3/2 BEs which is consistent with the above observation. However, this does not completely discard the possibility of a small extent of surface reduction upon introduction of the samples inside the analysis chamber. Therefore, the presence of surface Vv detected in our experiments should be taken as a lower limit and its concentration is suspected to be higher under reaction conditions. To further investigate the suspected presence of Vv centers on the surface of bulk VTM solids, the oxidation and the reduction of (VO)2P207 and used catalysts with different P/V ratios were carefully studied. The samples were subjected to oxidation or reduction in a pretreatment chamber directly attached to the XPS spectrometer. 3.2. Oxidation and reduction of (VO)2P207 (P/V= 1.0) Figs. 1 and 2 show the evolution of the O 1 s, V 2p and P 2p signals during oxygen treatment of (VO) 2P207 at increasing temperatures. In both cases the peaks obtained by curve fitting of the O ls and P 2p signals are shown. The exact BEs and FWHMs are given in Table 3. The starting parameters for the O l s peak synthesis were the BEs and FWHMs measured for (VO)zPzO7 and /3-VOPO4 (Table 2). They were allowed to fluctuate around these values to obtain the best fit to the experimental peak. An identical criterium was applied to the P 2p peak synthesis. Spectrum A belongs to the starting vanadyl pyrophosphate. After heating in oxygen at 742 K, spectrum B, a new O ls signal at 531.0 eV appears through peak synthesis and a substantial broadening of the P 2p peak is also observed, an overall evolution further substantiated at 763 K (Table 3). At 778 (C) and 823 K (Table 3) the dominant contribution to the O ls signal is located at 531.0 eV and a single P 2p peak at 133.1 eV is now observed, while the peak width of the V 2p3/2 signal decreases from 2.7 eV to 1.5 eV. These BEs are characteristic of/3- VOPO4 (Table 2), indicating that the surface is completely oxidized after oxygen exposure at about 778 K. The data obtained after heating the vanadyl pyrophosphate in either nitrogen or argon at 683 K are given in Table 3. With either of these treatments the main effect observed is the downward shift of the peaks' BEs accompanied by a significant decrease of the O 1 s width. This may indicate that strongly chemisorbed oxygen is retained on the solids. This strongly adsorbed oxygen might be the species denoted as O~ by Gleaves et al. [ 23 ]. Consistent with this explanation, the curve fitting of the O ls signal of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1, spectrum A) reveals a peak at 533.3 eV. This peak may be due to chemisorbed oxygen as reported on other solids [24]. This oxygen has been chemisorbed during either calcination or reac- tion. This is supported by the fact that the O ls signal is not affected by heating L.M. Cornaglia, E.A.

The most probable sites for oxygen chemisorption are the exposed VTM sites located on the [ 100] planes of the (VO)2P207. Pepera et al. [25] based on exper- imental data of oxygen adsorption on VPO, and SchiCtt et al. [26] with their theoretical calculations further support this assignment. The spectrum obtained after heating the (VO)2P207 in hydrogen is somewhat different from those obtained after inert gas treatments (Table 3). As expected, the 134 L.M. Cornaglia, E.A.

To further investigate this behavior the (O/V) s and (P/V)s surface atomic ratios were calculated from the XPS data and reported in Table 4. The samples treated in oxygen do not show any change in either ratio. On the other hand, the inert gas- or hydrogen-treated samples show increased surface phosphorus enrichment, in the latter case also accompanied by higher (O/V)s ratios. Two possible explanations for the O ls increase in the hydrogen treated samples might be either the retention of water produced by the reaction of hydrogen with chemisorbed oxygen, or the L.M.

Oxidation of equilibrated catalysts (P/V> 1) Table 5 shows the data obtained when vanadyl pyrophosphate (P/V > 1 ) was heated in oxygen under static and flow conditions at atmospheric pressure. When the oxidation was conducted in the pretreatment chamber attached to the XPS instrument, both the V 2p and P 2p peaks were shifted to lower BEs while an O ls peak located at 530.6 eV became visible. This experiment was repeated with four different solids yielding the same data. 136 L.M. Cornaglia, E.A.

To further investigate this behavior another aliquot of the same vanadyl pyro- phosphate was oxidized under oxygen flow at 773 K for three hours in an external reactor. With this procedure, it was possible to recover enough sample to obtain the X-ray patterns which revealed the appearance of both the/3'-phase and ceii- VOPO4. The XPS spectrum becomes very similar to those obtained with the bulk oei~ and/3 '-phases (Table 2). The oxidation was repeated in the static mode using the same reactor, last row of Table 5, yielding a similar XPS spectrum. These results clearly indicate that not only the bulk but also the surface of the catalysts with excess phosphorus are oxidized to VPO phases which in the bulk and/or the surface contain both VTM and Vv centers. In stoichiometric solids the oxidation leads to the formation of/3-VOPO4 with overwhelming predominance of Vv. ( Fig. 1 and Table 3 ). These results are consistent with the well-known increased resistance to oxidation of bulk VPO solids with excess phosphorus [4]. Matsuura and co-workers [27,28] have reported that (VO)2PzO7 (P/V > 1 ) oxidizes to the /3'-phase and speculate that a surface VO(PO3)z phase might be formed which impairs the oxidation to/3-VOPO4. In the same vein Garbassi et al. [ 11 ] observed, using XPS, that excess phosphorus in VPO solids increases the calcination tem- perature needed to oxidize the surface. The presence of VO(PO3)2 in our less oxidized sample (Table 5, second row) may be hinted from the appearance of a single V 2p3/2 peak shifted at 516.8 eV for the sample cannot be reduced in oxygen and the natural explanation for this shift to lower BE is an increased electronic density of the VTM centers. This may be effected by the change in structure which occurs in the (VO)zP207 --> VO(PO3)2 transformation. 4. Conclusions After analyzing the data obtained with over 40 monophasic precursors and catalysts, it is concluded that small but detectable amounts of surface Vv species L.M. Cornaglia, E.A.

The presence of MY on the surface of catalysts and increased resistance to oxidation with excess phosphorus. Treatment temperature given between brackets. are present on (VO)2P207 (Tables 1 and 2). These species may be initiated by strong oxygen chemisorption on exposed electron acceptor VIv centers located on the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate. This strongly adsorbed oxygen is wiped out from the surface by inert gases at 683 K (Table 3 ). Note that after this treatment not only the V 2p3/2 and O 1 s binding energies are shifted downwards but also the peak width of the latter is significantly decreased as shown in Fig. 3A and B. This is further supported by the independently well-documented presence of strongly chemisorbed oxygen [ 23 ] and the proven existence of very strong Lewis (electron acceptor) sites detected through the adsorption of bases monitored by infrared spectroscopy [29]. It is also concluded from these studies that the excess phosphorus not only prevents the oxidation of the bulk to the more stable/~-VOPO4 phase but, more important still, it limits the total oxidation of the surface under severe conditions (compare oxidation data from Tables 3 and 5, Fig. 3C and E). 138 L.M.

(+54-42) 553727. The oxidation states of vanadium on the surface of VPO catalysts which show the characteristic diffraction pattern of vanadyl pyrophosphate have been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The (VO)2P2O7 phase is obtained from crystalline precursors which show the X-ray pattern of VOHPO4·1/2H2O. The XPS spectra of 40 solids (precursors, catalysts, and model compounds) hinted the presence of low concentrations of VV centers on the surface of the bulk VIV catalysts. To further investigate this matter, the solids were oxidized or reduced in a pretreatment chamber attached to the spectrometer. These studies confirmed the presence of VV centers on the surface of the catalysts which may be initiated by strong oxygen chemisorption on exposed VIV sites of (VO)2P2O7. It is also shown that the presence of excess phosphorus prevents the oxidation of the surface (and the bulk) to β-VOPO4, a phase which has a deleterious effect on catalyst performance.
