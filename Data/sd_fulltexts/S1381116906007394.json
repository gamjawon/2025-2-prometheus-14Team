Graphical abstract A molecular halide cluster [(Ta6Cl12)Cl2(H2O)4]·4H2O catalyzed the aldol condensation of acetone with benzaldehyde to yield E-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one above 200°C. 3-Pentanone combined with benzaldehyde provided indenes such as E- and Z-1-ethylidene-2-methylindene, by cyclodehydration of the aldol condensation product, E-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one. One of the advantages of halide cluster catalysts is thermal stability, and high temperatures above 350°C promoted the cyclodehydration. When a molecular halide cluster [(Ta6Cl12)Cl2(H2O)4]·4H2O (1)/SiO2 was treated in a helium stream above 200°C, it catalyzed the aldol condensation of acetone with benzaldehyde to yield E-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one. The bromide cluster of Ta and chloride clusters of Nb, Mo, and W of the same octahedral metal framework also catalyzed the reaction. 3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanone combined with benzaldehyde similarly yielded the corresponding aldol condensation product over 1/SiO2 at 400°C. On the other hand, 3-pentanone combined with benzaldehyde provided indenes such as E- and Z-1-ethylidene-2-methylindene and 2-methyl-3-vinylindene of the same carbon skeletal structure, which would be formed by cyclodehydration of the aldol condensation product, E-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one. One of the advantages of halide cluster catalysts is thermal stability, and high temperatures above 350°C promoted the cyclodehydration. Keywords Catalysis by halide cluster Tantalum chloride cluster Aldol condensation of acetone with benzaldehyde Acyclic ketone Cyclodehydration to indene 1 Introduction We have reported a series of reactions catalyzed by halide clusters, which have an octahedral metal array structure with terminal, edge-bridging, or face-capping halogen π-donor ligands. One of the specific features of halide cluster catalysis is Brønsted acidity. Dehydration of alcohol [1], ring-attachment isomerization of diethylbenzenes [2], methylation of toluene with methanol [3], and dehydrogenation of aliphatic amines [4] have been reported. One of the approaches to characterizing the catalytic activity of halide clusters and, accordingly, to understanding the scope and limitations of halide cluster catalysis is a physicochemical investigation of activated halide clusters. Another approach is to apply clusters to many organic compounds and to discover new catalytic reactions: a comprehensive view of the catalyst can be obtained by comparison with other catalysts. Thermal stability is characteristic of halide clusters. In contrast to carbonyl clusters, which decompose below 200°C, halide clusters are synthesized at a temperature range of 650–1700°C. The maximum catalytic activity of a molybdenum cluster [(Mo6Cl8)Cl4(H2O)2]·6H2O, for example, appeared at around 400°C; its cluster framework began to decay above 400°C and was partly retained as high as at 600°C [5]. The aldol condensation is well investigated and is catalyzed by acids and bases, the latter being more frequently employed [6]. Sulfuric acid [7], Nafion-H, Amberlite IR-120 [8], and RuCl3 [9] have been used as acid catalysts, and NaOH [10], Ba(OH)2 [11], choline hydroxide/MgO [12], hydrotalcite [13], guanidine [14], and the basic sites of alumina [15,16] have been used as base catalysts. In near-critical water both oxonium ion and hydroxide ion catalyzed the reaction [17]. Catalytic activities of halide clusters for the aldol condensation are the subject of this report. Successive reactions to create indenes by taking advantage of the high temperatures will also be shown. 2 Experimental The cluster complexes [(Nb6Cl12)Cl2(H2O)4]·4H2O [18], (H3O)2[(Mo6Cl8)Cl6]·6H2O [19], [(Ta6Cl12)Cl2(H2O)4]·4H2O (1) [18], [(Ta6Br12)Br2(H2O)4]·4H2O [18], and (H3O)2[(W6Cl8)Cl6]·6H2O [20] were prepared according to published procedures. The cluster Re3Cl9 was a commercial product. The clusters were supported on silica gel (Nippon Aerosil, Tokyo, Aerosil 380m2/g) at 5.0wt.% in the following manner. Silica gel (19.0g) was added to a methanol solution (330mL) of the cluster (1.0g) and allowed to stand for 1h with occasional shaking. Then the solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum at ambient temperature. Masses of the dried silica gel were crushed and screened to 150–200mesh. A conventional vertical glass fixed-bed micro reactor with a continuous flow system was operated at atmospheric pressure [21]. Typically, a weighed supported sample of 1/SiO2 (100mg) was packed in a glass tube (3mm i.d.) and located at the center of an electric furnace. The catalyst sample was initially treated at 400°C for 1h in a helium stream (300mL/h). The reaction was initiated by feeding an equimolar mixture of acetone (42μL/h, 0.57mmol/h) and benzaldehyde (58μL/h, 0.57mmol/h) into the stream of helium at the treatment temperature. The reaction was monitored by sampling the reaction gas followed by analyses using an online GLC (Apiezon Grease L on Uniport B packed column). The reactor effluent was frozen in a dry-ice trap for subsequent analyses with GLC and GC/MS. Most of the reaction products, including all the indenes, were isolated by preparative GLC and subjected to NMR and mass analyses.

The reaction profile is plotted in Fig. 1 . The reactivity decreased with time, but the selectivity leveled off after 3h. The cluster catalyzed the cross aldol condensation to yield E-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one with around 75% selectivity (Eq. (1)), with some decomposition to benzene, toluene, and styrene. No Z isomer of the condensation product was detected as reported in other cases of the aldol condensation [6]. The material balance was 90%. In many reported cases, excess acetone with solvent is used to prevent self-condensation of acetone and for effective use of benzaldehyde [22]. In this study, both substrates were efficiently converted to the corresponding product. Higher adducts such as E,E-dibenzylideneacetone and oligomers were not formed. (1) C6H5CHO+CH3COCH3 →C6H5 CHCHCOCH3 +H2O Neither the cross aldol condensation of acetophenone with benzaldehyde nor self-condensation of benzaldehyde proceeded under the same reaction conditions. Reactions of acetone with butyraldehyde proceeded non-selectively, affording a wide variety of disproportionation products with trace amounts of the cross aldol condensation product, E-3-hepten-2-one. Thus, activation of acetone is a key step of the reaction with benzaldehyde. The reaction profiles of acetone with benzaldehyde at different temperatures catalyzed by 1/SiO2 are plotted in Fig. 2 . The activity developed slightly when the reaction was performed at 200°C, and increased with increasing temperature. The activity decreased with time, probably because of coke deposition in the gas–solid reaction [8]. Higher reaction temperatures resulted in sharper decreases in activity. The effect of the reaction temperature on the activity and selectivity over 1/SiO2 is presented in Fig. 3 . The catalytic activity had a maximum at around 425°C. The selectivity for the aldol condensation remained as high as 80% up to 375°C. Above this temperature, the selectivity for decomposition to principally benzene increased with increasing temperature. In general, a reaction that increases the number of product molecules is thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures. Table 1 lists the catalytic activity of various clusters of group 5–7 metals and related compounds. Supported Ta bromide cluster exhibited considerably higher activity and selectivity for the aldol condensation. Under both helium and nitrogen streams, supported 1 exhibited moderate selectivities for the reaction. Supported Nb and W chloride clusters also demonstrated moderate selectivities; however, the Re chloride cluster, which has a triangular metal core, catalyzed hydrogenolysis to yield benzene preferentially. 3.2 Aldol condensation of acyclic ketones Some acyclic ketones were subjected to reaction with benzaldehyde in the presence of 1/SiO2, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . 3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanone, which has no α-hydrogen at the site opposite to the methyl group, was effectively converted to the cross aldol condensation product, E-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one. 3-Pentanone afforded no aldol condensation products seemingly, but selectively provided substituted indenes of the same skeletal structure of the carbon. Different regioselectivities for the aldol condensation of unsymmetrical aliphatic ketones such as butanone and 2-pentanone have been well established: the acid-catalyzed reaction of butanone with benzaldehyde affords E-3-methyl-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (3a) by activation of the methylene group of butanone, while the base-catalyzed reaction yields E-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one (4a) by activation of the methyl group [6,29,30] (Scheme 1 ). The methylene group of acyclic non-methyl ketones is hardly activated by base catalysts [6,31]. Formation of Brønsted acid sites on the activated W halide cluster has been confirmed by pyridine adsorption [3], and no basic sites were detected by CO2 adsorption on the activated Ta halide cluster. If those sites were present, the cluster catalyst would provide the acid-catalyzed product, E-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one (5) (Scheme 2 ). When E-Z isomerization of this initial product proceeds, the carbonyl group is accessible to the ortho hydrogen, leading to cyclodehydration to yield 1,2-disubstituted indenes (6); this is the case for 3-pentanone. Halide clusters catalyzed E-Z isomerization of olefins [21] and dehydration of alcohols to olefins [1]. Thus, isomerization followed by dehydration is feasible over halide clusters. In the case of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone, there is no α-hydrogen in the t-butyl group for dehydration, and hence indene was not formed. The aldol condensation product of acetone with benzaldehyde, E-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, was subjected to the reaction under identical conditions, and the result is listed in Table 2. The selectivity for the indenes is much higher than that starting from acetone with benzaldehyde, which shows that the aldol condensation product is an intermediate species to indene. As Table 2 shows, butanone and 2-pentanone afforded 2-methyl-1-methyleneindene (2a) and 2-ethyl-1-methyleneindene (2b) with their hydrogenation products, which would be formed by way of acid-catalyzed-type products 3 (Scheme 1). In each case, the carbon frameworks of the produced indenes are the same, and hence they afford the same indane derivative when the olefinic bonds are hydrogenated [32]. Small amounts of base-catalyzed-type products 4 were formed at the same time. The regioselectivity of the aldol condensation is established as mentioned above. However, detailed studies of the reaction revealed that the product selectivity is not decisive: a small amount of the counterpart was formed concomitantly over both acid [33] and base [10,34] catalysts. In the reaction of butanone with benzaldehyde, for example, basic alumina catalyst afforded acid-catalyzed-type products with 16–35% selectivity [16], and Co(II)-2,2′-dipyridine complex catalyst yielded acid- and base-catalyzed-type products with 6:94 regioselectivity [35]. Therefore, the formation of base-catalyzed-type products 4 from butanone and 2-pentanone with 10–18% selectivity is acceptable. Indenes attributable to 4 were not detected (Scheme 1). Acetone combined with benzaldehyde yielded the corresponding indenes with 3–9% selectivity over various clusters at 400°C, as shown in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows that the selectivity for indenes increased above 350°C. In general, a reaction that increases the number of product molecules is thermodynamically favorable at elevated temperatures. Increasing selectivity for decomposition of aldol condensation product to indene and water with increasing temperature accords with this principle. There have been only a few reports of the aldol condensation performed under harsh conditions, since the rates are sufficiently rapid at room temperature and the maximum yields are usually reached within 12–24h [6]. Ruthenium chloride, which served as an acid catalyst, did not yield the secondary product at 120°C in the reaction of methyl ketones with benzaldehyde [9]. No secondary condensation products have been reported in the reaction of benzaldehyde with excess acetone and butanone at 160°C over basic alumina [16]. On the other hand, under microwave irradiation, acetone reacted with two moles of benzaldehyde yielding E,E-dibenzylideneacetone [36]. Three moles of benzaldehyde added to butanone afforded 5-benzylidene-2-methyl-3,4-diphenyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one in the presence of TiCl4 at 120°C [37]. In near-critical water at 250–350°C, oligomers of butanone and benzaldehyde were obtained [17]. Thus, there are no precedents for the catalytic one-step synthesis of indenes from acyclic ketones and benzaldehyde. Application of high temperatures, which is one of the advantages of halide cluster catalyses, presumably caused the cyclodehydration of the aldol condensation products, as the equilibrium shifts to the cyclodehydration with increased temperature. 4 Conclusion The cross aldol condensation of acyclic ketones with benzaldehyde was studied over halide clusters as catalyst. A supported tantalum chloride cluster, [(Ta6Cl12)Cl2(H2O)4]·4H2O (1), on silica gel catalyzed the condensation of acetone to yield E-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one selectively above 200°C, with the maximum activity at around 425°C. Similarly, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone, which has no α-hydrogen at the site opposite the methyl group, was effectively converted to the corresponding cross aldol condensation product. On the other hand, 3-pentanone afforded 1,2-disubstituted indenes (6) of the same carbon framework instead of the expected aldol condensation product, E-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-penten-3-one (5). The initial product 5 would undergo E–Z isomerization followed by cyclodehydration to yield 6. There have been no precedents for the one-step synthesis of indenes from an acyclic ketone and benzaldehyde, although more than 2300 reports on the aldol condensation were published prior to 1968 [6]. The aldol condensation is usually accomplished at room temperature, and excessively high temperatures are generally unnecessary. Application of high temperatures, which is one of the advantages of halide cluster catalyses, probably caused the cyclodehydration to indenes, as the equilibrium shifts to cyclodehydration with increased temperature.
