Tel.: +81-426-77-2837; Fax: +81-426-77-2821; E-mail: kawai-tadashi@c.metro-u.ac.jp Tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes have been successfully metathesized for the first time over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with tetrabutyltin under mild reaction conditions. All of the products were acyclic oligomers via intermolecular metathesis; the cyclic products via intramolecular metathesis were not formed. Keywords Tetravinylsilane Vinylsilanes Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) Metathesis Nonlinear optical material Silylenevinylene Rhenia–alumina catalyst (Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst) 1 Introduction Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst is one of the best metathesis catalysts due to its high activity and selectivity for various kinds of simple alkenes at low temperatures. Indeed, we have shown that n-alkenes [1, 2], alkadienes [3–6], and alkyl-substituted alkenes [7, 8], except alkyl-substituted vinylene compounds [9, 10], were metathesized with high activity and selectivity of >94% over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts. Numerous studies on metathesis of various kinds of functionalized alkenes have also been reported[11]. Various kinds of alkenylsilanes [11] have been metathesized in the presence of several different metathesis catalysts. Re2O7/Al2O3 and Schrock catalysts appeared to exhibit high activity for alkenylsilanes [11]. Only a few study can be seen on the metathesis of vinyltrisubstituted silanes [12–14] and divinyldisubstituted silanes [15]. It has been reported that the metathesis of vinyltrimethylsilane proceeded over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with tetrabutyltin (SnBu4) [12–14] and Schrock catalyst was inactive for the acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) of divinyldimethylsilanes [15]. Thus, there is actually no paper on the ADMET of divinyldisubstituted silanes over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, a variety of ruthenium and rhodium catalysts work well for both reactants [16–24]. Recently, Marciniec and Lewandowski [25, 26] have succeeded to get silylene–vinylene oligomers via polycondensation of divinyldimethylsilane and divinyltetramethyldisiloxane in the presence of RuCl2(PPh3)3 and [RhCl(cod)]2, but the reaction has been interpreted in terms of a non-metallacarbene mechanism. If the metathesis of divinylsilanes proceeds in a similar way to that of 1,4-alkadiene [6], the following metathesis reaction will occur. In the equation, when the substituent Y is a vinyl group, the spiro compounds together with oligo(silyenevinylene) may be obtained. The poly(silyenevinylene) and spiro compounds with σ–π conjugation are of growing interest and importance as a partly conjugated optical material with high transparency and relatively high second hyperpolarizibility predicted by ab-initio molecular orbital calculation [27]. The products display also a variety of properties (potential electric conductivity, nonlinear optical response, electro- and photoluminescence) and thus are interesting materials for many applications. Here, we report a novel synthesis of oligo(silylenevinylene)s by an ADMET of tetravinylsilane and acyclic divinyldisubstituted silanes over a Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with SnBu4 as a cocatalyst. The oligomers were structurally characterized. 2 Experimental A Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst (80–100 mesh) was prepared by using the impregnation technique described in previous papers [1, 3]. The Re2O7 content was 18.1 wt.%, as determined by inductively coupled plasma on a Shimadzu ICPS-500 spectrometer. Tetravinylsilane, dimethyldivinylsilane, diphenyldivinylsilane and diethoxydivinylsilane used as the starting materials and n-dodecane as an internal standard were dried over molecular sieves 5 Å. n-Decane used as a solvent was dried over P2O5 and distilled. SnBu4 was used as purchased without further purification (>99% purity). The reactions were carried out in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure of nitrogen gas in a Schlenk type glass reactor with stirring. The catalyst (0.5 g) was oxidized at 480°C for 1 h in dry oxygen gas flow and activated in situ at 500°C for 2 h in dry nitrogen gas flow, followed by cooling to reaction temperature. The catalyst was pretreated with SnBu4 (30 mmol) before dosing the reactant. The reactant of 2.9 mmol (0.40 g), Sn/Re molar ratio 0.37, n-decane (4 ml) as a solvent and n-dodecane as an internal standard were used as a standard procedure. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC-12A equipped with an FID and a chemically bonded capillary column HP-5 (25 m×0.32 mm). Mass spectroscopy data were obtained with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000, gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, equipped with Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph with a chemically bonded capillary column DB-1 (60 m×0.25 mm). 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectra were measured on JEOL JNM-EX270 (270 MHz). Chloroform-d was used as solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Each oligomer separated by using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Shodex SD-4 were used for the identification and characterization of reaction products. 3 Results and discussion The effects of reaction temperature on catalytic activity are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of reaction time. The catalytic activity increased with increasing reaction temperatures. Since Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts have usually high activity for the metathesis of various kinds of olefin even at room temperature, the reaction rate of tetravinylsilane seems very slow. One of reasons could be the steric hindrance caused by the two substituents, two vinyl groups in this case, on the Si atom in the stage of interaction between metal–carbene and reactant, and/or following formation of metallacyclobutane intermediate. Another reason could be the stabilization of metal–carbene complex caused by the interaction between the vacant 3d orbitals of the Si atom and the carbene center [14]. The GC chart for the metathesis of tetravinysilane as an example, shown in Fig. 2 , illustrates the very clean nature of the ADMET reaction. By-products were virtually not formed and thus the selectivities of metathesis products remained constant (ca. 100%) within the reaction temperature investigated. The product distribution is shown in Fig. 3 . The ratio of higher oligomers increased with increasing in reaction time (conversion), suggesting that the intermolecular metathesis proceeds as a series of successive reactions. Oligomers were isolated by GPC and characterized by 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectra [28]. The structures of oligomers and the isomer ratio of tetramer to hexamer were determined from GC and NMR data. 1,1-Disilyethenes formed by a non-metallacarbene mechanism over the Ru catalysts [25, 26] were not detected. All oligomers were acyclic type as shown in Table 1 and this shows that they were produced through olefin metathesis mechanism, carbene mechanism. Cyclic spiro compounds were not detected by GC-MS. The absorption band assigned to the σ–π conjugation was observed at 220 nm for the all oligomers [28]. It was found that ADMET of diphenyldivinylsilane, diethoxydivinylsilane and dimethydivinylsilane proceeded over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst and also Re2O7/SiO2·Al2O3 catalyst promoted with SnBu4 [28]. The following order of increasing reactivity was determined: diphenyldivinylsilane<diethoxydivinylsilane<dimethydivinylsilane<tetravinylsilane [28]. References 1 T. Kawai Y. Yamazaki A.
