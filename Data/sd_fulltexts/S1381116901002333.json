Fax: +86-10-6277-0304 The promoting effects of various calcium salts on the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 in isosynthesis were studied in this work. Calcium salts were added into zirconia by mechanical mixing methods. Catalytic tests were performed under relatively mild operation conditions (673K, 650h−1, 5.0MPa). CaF2 and CaSO4 were found to be effective additives, which could remarkably enhance the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons while maintaining the activity of pure ZrO2 when being added into zirconia. However, Ca(NO3)2, Ca(BO2)2 and CaCl2 wholly changed the distribution of hydrocarbons to favor the methanation. The results of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2 indicated that the performance of the catalysts depended on the acid–base properties of the catalysts. The appropriate amount of acid and base and the ratio of the basic to acidic sites on the catalysts are significant for the synthesis of i-C4 hydrocarbons from CO hydrogenation. Keywords Isosynthesis Zirconia Calcium salts Promoting effect Acid and base properties 1 Introduction Isosynthesis is the reaction that converts synthesis gas (CO+H2) to isobutene and isobutane (i-C4). It was first reported by Pichler and Ziesecke [1–4] using several transition metal oxides (ThO2, CeO2) or mixed-oxide systems (ThO2–Al2O3, ThO2–ZnO and so on) to catalyze CO hydrogenation under very severe conditions (150–1000atm). Zirconia has been shown to be active in the isosynthesis with high selectivity for isobutene [5]. It has the advantage over thoria because of no radioactivity. So recent investigations on the activity and selectivity of isosynthesis have been performed over zirconium dioxide-based catalysts. Maruya et al. [6] studied the promoting effects of various oxide compounds. They found that the addition of highly electronegative oxide such as SiO2 and Nb2O5 resulted in the decrease of isobutene and the increase of methane. ZrO2 modified with NaOH could promote the selective formation of C4 hydrocarbons (about 85%) while decreasing overall activity. They suggested that the electronegativity of the dopant oxide was significant for the formation of C4 hydrocarbons, especially isobutene. This work was performed at very low conversions (0–5%). Jackson and Ekerdt [7] investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies and acidity on the isosynthesis reaction conducted at 698K and 35atm. The oxygen vacancy availability was altered by the addition of dopants Y2O3 and CaO in varying concentrations. The acid–base strength of the catalysts was altered by additives including H2SO4, Sc2O3 and etc. The most active catalysts were those in which ionic conductivity was at a maximum, suggesting that vacancies in the crystal lattice play an important role in the reaction. A balance of acidic and basic properties on ZrO2 was suggested to be necessary for isobutene formation. But in a similar manner to the previous work by Pichler and Ziesecke over a 20% Al2O3/ThO2 catalyst [1], methane was the predominant product with a low i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons. Postula et al. [8] prepared zirconia-based catalysts by precipitation or hydrothermally method and tested the catalytic performance for the isosynthesis under modelatively mild reaction conditions (673K, 50atm, CO/H2=1). The effects of sodium, titanium, cerium, and thorium additives were investigated. The highest yield of i-C4 hydrocarbons was obtained over a precipitated 7wt.% Ce–ZrO2 at 150s space time. The CO conversion was largely increased (about 35%) while a low i-C4 selectivity was maintained as is for pure ZrO2 (about 20%). It is therefore evident that the activity and selectivity in the isosynthesis are still challenging problems to be overcome. We have reported a novel method (mechanical mixing method) to prepare promoted ZrO2 [9]. The results of adding acidic or basic components into zirconia suggested that both the acidic and basic sites on the catalysts are necessary for the isosynthesis. In this paper, we report the promoting effect of calcium salts added into ZrO2 by mechanical mixing method on the activity and selectivity in the isosynthesis. The selectivity to C4 hydrocarbons especially i-C4 fractions was largely enhanced while a relatively high reactivity was maintained as pure ZrO2. The surface acid–base properties required for the catalytic performance of zirconia in the isosynthesis are evaluated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts Hydrous zirconia was prepared by adding dropwise a solution of ZrOCl2 (0.15mol/l) into the well-stirred ammonium solution (2.5%) at room temperature. The pH value during precipitation was carefully controlled at 10. The white precipitate formed was aged in the mother liquor for 3h, followed by filtering and washing with deionized water until Cl− was not detectable. The resultant paste was dried at 378K overnight and calcined at 823K for 1.5h. A calcium salt was milled together with ZrO2 and then the mixture was calcined again at 823K for 1.5h. The prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The calcium salts, CaSiO3, Ca(BO2)2 and Ca(AlO2)2 were prepared according to the literature [10–12]. The others were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company. The crystal phase of prepared CaSiO3 and Ca(BO2)2 were confirmed by XRD. But Ca(AlO2)2 was found to be a mixture of Al2O3 and CaO (12CaO·7Al2O3). 2.2 Characterization The crystal phase and particle size of the prepared catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a D8 advance powder diffractometer (Brüker Co., Germany) with Cu Kα radiation with a nickel filter. The peaks (2θ=28 and 31° for the ( 1 ̄ 11) and (111) reflections, respectively) reflect the monoclinic phase. The peaks (2θ=30° for the (111) reflection) in the XRD profile show the tetragonal phase. The particle sizes determined by XRD was calculated from the half-width of the ( 1 ̄ 11) reflection of monoclinic phase, after correction of the peak width for the contribution by instrumental broadening, using the Debye–Scherrer equation: D hkl =0.89λ/B hkl cosθ. Measurement of surface area was performed on a CHEMBET-3000 using N2 as adsorption gas. Before measurement, the samples were treated at 473K in helium flow for 8h. The acid–base properties of the catalysts were measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia and carbon dioxide, respectively. TPD experiments were carried out in a flow apparatus. The sample (0.1g) was treated at its calcined temperature in highly pure helium (≥99.995%) flow for 3h, and then saturated with a 1.0% NH3/He mixture or highly pure CO2 (99.99%) flow after cooling to 373K. After flushed with He at 373K for 1h to remove physisorbed NH3 or CO2, the sample was heated to 823K at a rate of 20K/min in a helium flow of 60cm3/min. The desorpted NH3 or CO2 was measured by a QMS (MSC200). 2.3 Reaction procedure The hydrogenation of CO was carried out in a fixed-bed flow type pressurized stainless steel tubular reactor (i.d. 8mm). The catalyst (2.1g) was packed in the reactor and pretreated in a stream of N2 at 673K for 3h. Then, syngas (CO/H2=1) was introduced into the reactor and the reaction was conducted at temperatures in the range of 673–723K at 5.0MPa and 650h−1. The reactor effluent was reduced to atmospheric pressure and then injected into two on-line gas chromatographs. One equipped with TCD was used to separate CO, CH4, CO2, C2, C3, CH3OH and CH3OCH3 through a GDX-101 column, and the other equipped with FID and a 30 m×0.53 mm Al2O3 capillary column was applied to separate hydrocarbons. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The physical properties of catalysts The crystal phase, specific surface area and particle size of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1. All the catalysts have a similar surface area (about 40–50m2/g) and particle sizes (13–19nm) calculated from the X-ray line broadening analysis (XLBA). The pure ZrO2 prepared by precipitation was monoclinic as reported in the literatures [9,13]. It has been reported that the oxides of zirconium form three different phases: monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic [14–16]. The monoclinic phase is stable below 1473K, and the cubic phase is formed at temperatures above 2553K. The presence of other doping metals in ZrO2 and the parameters of precipitation play a role in determining the final crystal phase. Jackson and Ekerdt [7] found that the cubic crystal structure of zirconium dioxide could exist even at room temperature when ZrO2 is doped with CaO or Y2O3 by coprecipitation. But in this work, the monoclinic phase was found to be the predominant for all the calcium salts promoted catalysts listed in Table 1. The fact that the cubic crystal structure was not observed might be due to the mechanical mixing method used to prepare promoted zirconia. In this method, the added Ca2+ probably exist on the surface of ZrO2 and cannot enter the lattice to influence the crystal structure of ZrO2. Maruya et al. [17] prepared zirconia with different crystal structure by controlling the pH of mother liquid for the precipitation from aqueous zirconium nitrate solution with aqueous ammonia. They found that the rate of formation of isobutene from CO and H2 over ZrO2 was proportional to the volume fraction of the monoclinic phase. However, the results of catalytic test listed in Table 2 would likely indicate that there are more significant factors controlling the performance of ZrO2 for the same crystal structure of the catalysts in this study. 3.2 NH3 and CO2 TPD of catalysts The acid and base characteristics of the catalysts are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1. ZrO2 has been well known as a bifunctional catalyst with both weak acid and base sites [18]. In this work, the weakly acidic and weakly basic properties of zirconia surface is indicated respectively by the desorption peaks of NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD at the temperatures lower than 573K, respectively. No significant differences were observed on the strength of acid and base between the ZrO2-based catalysts promoted by various calcium salts and pure ZrO2 (Figs. 1 and 2). However, the amount of acidic and basic sites markedly varied with the type of calcium salt added (see Table 1). Calcium salts such as CaF2 and CaSO4 increased the amount of both acidic and basic sites on ZrO2 when added into zirconia. Some calcium salts (CaCO3, CaO, and Ca(AlO2)2) maintained the amount of acidic and basic sites. Ca(NO3)2 clearly decreased the amount of acidic sites on ZrO2, while Ca(BO2)2 and CaCl2 remarkably decreased the amount of basic sites on ZrO2. 3.3 Catalytic performance of the catalysts Table 2 lists the performance of the catalysts promoted by various calcium salts in the isosynthesis at 673K. The blank reactivity of the stainless steel tube surface was also measured at the same reaction conditions following the same reaction procedure as the catalytic tests of the catalysts. Methane was the primary product and neither C4 + hydrocarbons nor oxygenated products were detected in the blank experiment (less than 1% CO conversion). It can be seen that about 12–20% of CO was converted into 46–52% hydrocarbons, 4–9% CH3OH+CH3OCH3 and 40–48% CO2 at 673K over most catalysts shown in Table 2. Very small amount of water was also formed in the products. Experimentally it was quite difficult to be quantitatively measured. It was shown that the catalysts were very stable; e.g. over CaF2–ZrO2 catalyst, the performance of the catalyst after 5h on stream (Table 2, no. 2a) was nearly the same as that after 1.5h on stream (Table 2, no. 2) at 673K. It could be demonstrated that over the catalyst CaF2–ZrO2 (no. 3), as an example, increasing reaction temperature to 723K resulted in an increase of CO conversion to about 30% and the disappearance of CH3OH and CH3OCH3 products without change in CO2/hydrocarbons ratio. Figs. 3 and 4 show the product distribution of hydrocarbons. Schulz–Flory distribution was not followed for the hydrocarbons except over CaCl2 promoted ZrO2 and the deviations would be due to the formation of large amounts of C4 and C5 + hydrocarbons (78–85% in total for most catalysts listed in Table 2). The formation of large percentage of heavier hydrocarbons (C5 + fractions) would be attributed to the higher pressure used, because increasing pressure shifted the product distribution toward heavier hydrocarbons. Previous work [1,8,13] reported a similar trend with increasing pressure. But in this work, the undesired products (C5 + hydrocarbons) were largely decreased (about 25% in total hydrocarbons) on pure ZrO2 (Table 2, no. 1) compared with that reported in the literatures (≥50%) under the similar reaction conditions. The C5 + selectivity in total hydrocarbons could even be significantly decreased over ZrO2 promoted by some calcium salts listed in Table 2 (nos. 2–6) while a relatively high CO conversion and i-C4 selectivity could be maintained. The i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons (i-C4/CH) over some of the catalysts shown in Table 2 (nos. 1–9) was nearly two times as high as that over 7wt.% Ce–ZrO2 catalyst reported by Postula (about 20%) [8]. The only difference in the reaction conditions between these two cases was that the space velocity of 650h−1 for the reaction in Table 2 was much higher than that of 50h−1 for the reaction studied by Postula. When reaction temperature increases or space velocity (h−1) decreases, for most of the catalysts shown in Table 2, the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons fell to about 35–41% and the CO conversion raised to about 30%, approaching the value of 35% reported by Postula. Therefore, ZrO2 as well as some of the promoted ZrO2 in Table 2 are promising catalysts for isosynthesis. The effects of various calcium salts additives on the isosynthesis over ZrO2 could be divided into three groups based on the C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons: (i) the calcium salts such as CaF2, CaSO4, CaSiO3, and Ca3(PO4)2 are able to produce a clearly positive effect on the selectivity of hydrocarbons when added into ZrO2. The C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons increased (Fig. 3) meanwhile the CO conversion was surely maintained. Moreover, this effect did not cause more CO2 production (see Table 2). Furthermore, the two salts of CaSO4 and CaF2 caused a clearly increase in the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons (i-C4/CH), but the other two salts of CaSiO3 and Ca3(PO4)2 maintained it with an increase of linear C4 hydrocarbons (n-C4). Nevertheless, the salts such as CaSO4, CaF2 obviously made an enhancement of i-C4 yield while CaSiO3, Ca3(PO4)2 salts kept i-C4 yield over ZrO2. (ii) CaCO3, CaO and Ca(AlO2)2 did not produce any distinct variation in the performance of ZrO2 in the isosynthesis (see Table 2 and Fig. 4). (iii) Ca(NO3)2, Ca(BO2)2 and CaCl2 showed an adverse effect on the C4 formation. Ca(NO3)2 and Ca(BO2)2 slightly decreased the CO conversion while CaCl2 strongly lowered it. These three additives completely changed the distribution of hydrocarbons. Methane became the predominant product and the C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons was far lower than that over pure ZrO2 (Fig. 4). It is well known that oxygen vacancies could be created to preserve lattice neutrality when a metal oxide with lower valence than Zr4+ was added into zirconia. Jackson and Ekerdt [7] doped zirconia with CaO and Y2O3 in varying concentrations to investigate the effect of oxygen vacancies on the isosynthesis reaction carried out at 673–698K, 3.5MPa, CO/H2=1. They suggested that the oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice play an important role in the isosynthesis. But in our experiments, the oxygen vacancies could not explain the distinct differences in the activity and selectivity of the zirconia-based catalysts because the Ca content of various catalysts listed in Table 2 was almost at the same level (about 9.1mol%) except for CaF2–ZrO2 catalysts (16.7mol%). 3.4 Influence of acid–base properties on the performance of the catalysts Figs. 5–9 show the correlations between the performance of the various calcium salts promoted ZrO2 catalysts shown in Table 2 and the amount of acidic and basic sites on the catalysts (Table 1). Fig. 5 shows the relationship of the activity and n-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons to the amount of acidic sites on various calcium salts promoted ZrO2 catalysts except CaCl2–ZrO2. It can be seen that the activity and n-C4 selectivity increased with an increase in the amount of acidic sites on ZrO2 promoted by various calcium salts. The lower activity over CaCl2–ZrO2 is expected because Cl− has been reported to be a poison for isosynthesis [19,20]. The adverse effect of Cl− on isosynthesis was further demonstrated by the test reaction using 9.1mol% NH4Cl–ZrO2 catalyst prepared by mechanical mixing method as CaCl2–ZrO2. The CO conversion was 6% with a low i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons (about 12%) over NH4Cl–ZrO2. On the other hand, the basic sites of catalysts do not seem to have any relationship to the activity and n-C4 selectivity, as shown in Fig. 6. This would suggest that CO is more easily adsorbed and activated on acidic sites of ZrO2 than basic sites, as reported by Su et al. [9]. The fact that n-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons increased with the increase of the amount of acidic sites and not basic sites on the catalysts would likely indicate that n-C4 is more probably formed on the acidic sites of the catalysts. On the other hand, the effect of enhancing the amount of acidic sites of the catalysts on i-C4 formation was not significant, as shown in Fig. 7. Although CaSiO3–ZrO2 and Ca3(PO4)2–ZrO2 catalysts possessed more acidic sites than CaF2–ZrO2 catalyst, i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons over CaSiO3–ZrO2 and Ca3(PO4)2–ZrO2 (about 40%) was far lower than that of CaF2–ZrO2 catalyst (50.5%). Feng et al. [13] also reported that the catalysts with strong acidity but minimal basicity, such as SiO2–ZrO2 (sol–gel), is less selective for i-C4 hydrocarbons. Maruya and coworkers also indicated the importance of basic sites of the catalysts in the isosynthesis [21]. Fig. 8 shows the relationship of i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons to the amount of basic sites on the catalysts. The higher the amount of basic sites on the catalysts, the higher i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons was obtained. That the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons increased with an increase in the amount of basic sites on zirconia modified by various calcium salts except for Ca(NO3)2 suggested that the basic sites of the catalysts are significant for the formation of isobutene and isobutane in the isosynthesis [9,17]. The observed increase in the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons over CaF2–ZrO2 and CaSO4–ZrO2 catalysts shown in Fig. 7 could not be attributed to the increase in the amount of acidic sites because the amount of basic sites were also enhanced. CaSiO3–ZrO2 and Ca3(PO4)2–ZrO2 catalysts showed no apparent effect on the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons compared with pure ZrO2 because the amount of basic sites were not apparently increased (see Table 1), although they possessed more acidic sites than ZrO2. It has been reported that the isosynthesis reaction involves two distinct chain growth steps, CO insertion into adsorbed aldehyde and aldol condensation between methoxide and enolate [22]. The condensation reaction was suggested to be responsible for the deviations from Schulz–Flory product distributions (see Figs. 3 and 4) in the isosynthesis [23,24], since this only contributes to the C3 + hydrocarbons because of lack of C1 enolate. The surface acid and base properties on ZrO2 could influence these two chain growth reactions [7,17]. In this study, the observed decrease in the C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons over Ca(NO3)2–ZrO2 catalyst (shown in Fig. 4) would be due to the marked decrease in the amount of acidic sites on ZrO2 (see Table 1) to retard the chain growth steps for the large portion of lighter hydrocarbons (C1, C2 fractions) in the productions (about 65% in total hydrocarbons). The lower C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons over CaCl2 and Ca(BO2)2 promoted ZrO2 shown in Fig. 4 could be attributed to the large decrease in the amount of basic sites on ZrO2 (see Table 1). This would likely suggest that both the acidic and basic sites on ZrO2 are important for the chain propagation to form heavier hydrocarbons (C4 + fractions). A large decrease in the amount of acidic or basic sites on ZrO2 would change the distribution of hydrocarbons to favor methanation. Nunan et al. [25,26] investigated in detail the mechanism of formation of higher alcohols from CO hydrogenation over cesium-doped Cu/ZnO catalysts. It was suggested that there are two competitively primary carbon chain growth types, linear chain growth via C1 addition steps and aldol condensation via β addition steps, which lead to linear primary alcohols and branched primary alcohols, respectively. The presence of cesium promoted the formation of the branched product by promoting the β additions than the linear chain growth. If isobutene was assumed to be produced by the dehydration of the primary product, isobutanol [22], our results would be consistent with the mechanism suggested by Nunan [26]. Fig. 9 shows the relationship of the ratio of i-C4 to n-C4 to the ratio of basic to acidic sites of the catalysts. The fact that the ratio of i-C4 to n-C4 hydrocarbons increased with increase in the ratio of basic to acidic sites would indicate that n-C4 and i-C4 are formed on different active sites on ZrO2 through the dehydration of C4 alcohols produced from C3 intermediates via the two competitive chain growth steps [26]; n-C4 hydrocarbons are more probably produced on the acidic sites via linear chain growth step, while i-C4 hydrocarbons are formed primarily on the basic sites of ZrO2 via aldol condensation step [17]. The ratio of basic sites to acidic sites on ZrO2 would influence the proportion of the two chain growth steps in the isosynthesis reaction and therefore determine the ratio of i-C4 to n-C4 hydrocarbons in the C4 fractions. 4 Conclusions The performance of the zirconia-based catalysts varied with the calcium salts added. CaF2 and CaSO4 proved to be effective promoters, which could remarkably enhance the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons and meanwhile surely maintain the activity of pure ZrO2, giving the highest yield of i-C4 hydrocarbons. The surface acidic–basic properties play an important role in determining the performance of the catalysts in the isosynthesis. The acidic sites are responsible for the activation of CO to start the reaction and the formation of n-C4 hydrocarbons. However, the basic sites are significant for the formation of i-C4 hydrocarbons. The ratio of basic to acidic sites on the catalysts would determine the percentage of i-C4 in total C4 hydrocarbons. The observed promoting effect of CaF2 and CaSO4 would be due to the increase in both acidic and basic sites on ZrO2 while maintaining an appropriate ratio of basic to acidic sites as pure ZrO2. The appropriate amount of acid and base and the ratio of the basic to acidic sites on the catalysts are significant for the direct synthesis of i-C4 hydrocarbons from CO hydrogenation.

        "dc:description": "The promoting effects of various calcium salts on the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 in isosynthesis were studied in this work. Calcium salts were added into zirconia by mechanical mixing methods. Catalytic tests were performed under relatively mild operation conditions (673K, 650h−1, 5.0MPa). CaF2 and CaSO4 were found to be effective additives, which could remarkably enhance the i-C4 selectivity in total hydrocarbons while maintaining the activity of pure ZrO2 when being added into zirconia. However, Ca(NO3)2, Ca(BO2)2 and CaCl2 wholly changed the distribution of hydrocarbons to favor the methanation. The results of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2 indicated that the performance of the catalysts depended on the acid–base properties of the catalysts. The appropriate amount of acid and base and the ratio of the basic to acidic sites on the catalysts are significant for the synthesis of i-C4 hydrocarbons from CO hydrogenation.",
