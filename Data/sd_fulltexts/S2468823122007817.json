The catalytic CO oxidation under mild conditions attracts extensive interests. The exploration about the catalytic CO oxidation mechanism illustrates that the conversion from the triplet state to the singlet state takes place during the adsorption of O2, which is followed by CO adsorption. The barrier of the first CO oxidation, which corresponds to the rate-determining step, can be lowered distinctly by Cu-doping. A quartet-to-doublet spin crossing facilitates the CO oxidation by C59Cu. Significant electron transfer from the C59Cu dopant activates the O2 and CO molecules, then decreases the barrier and accelerates the reaction rate. The C59Cu dopant is an efficient catalyst for CO oxidation owing to the low-barrier (2.1 kcal/mol) CO oxidation reaction. It would be a potential material in solving the environmental protection problems and the purification of H2 for fuel cell applications Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Single-atom catalyst CO oxidation Fullerene Natural bond orbital Activation energy Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The low atomic economy in traditional catalysts is usually caused by small ratio of surface metal atoms to internal ones, which are generally inert. Reducing the catalysts into nanoclusters or sub-nanoclusters can increase this ratio, then enhance the atomic economy and the catalytic activity. The quantum confinement at the nanometric level can decrease the adsorption energy of the intermediate catalytic reactants and improve the catalytic efficiency [1]. It is reported that the single atom catalysts (SACs) have extremely high atom efficiency, showing excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H2 [2]. Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to SACs, which exhibit wonderful catalytic activity towards many important reactions, such as nitrogen reduction reaction [3–5], hydrogen evolution reaction [6–8], oxygen evolution reaction [9–11], oxygen reduction reaction [12–14], as well as CO oxidation reaction [15–18]. Various novel nanomaterials, such as graphene [19], graphyne [20,21], BN [22–24], and MoS2 [25–27], have been widely studied as supports for SACs owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio. The unique physical and chemical properties, as well as the stability of fullerene offer novel opportunities to tailor both the electronic structures and the catalytic activities of the nanohybride structures. Fullerene have played a crucial role in the development of highly efficient catalysts [28,29]. Fullerene based low-dimensional nanosystems will continue to impact both materials science and catalysis in many ways owing to their attractive and desirable properties for the development of high-performance catalysts [30]. Many excellent work involving the open-cage fullerene [31], oxide-cluster fullerene [32], endohedral metallofullerenes [33–36] and exohedral fullerene [37] have been collected in recent reviews. Although the progress that has been made, the development of advanced fullerene-based nanometric level catalysis is still at an early stage, then, more details about the underlying catalytic mechanism need to be revealed. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports about the catalytic activity of fullerene related SACs [38], where, it is reported that a quintet-to-triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60-supported V+. This remains as a potentially open and exciting avenue to explore. As a benchmark reaction in heterogeneous catalysis, the catalytic CO oxidation under mild conditions attracts considerable interests owing to its significance in solving the environmental protection problems and the purification of H2 for fuel cell applications. The CO oxidation occurs according to the following elementary reactions: (1) * + O2 → *O2 (2) *O2 + CO → *O2…CO (3) *O2…CO → *O…OCO (4) *O…OCO → *O + CO2 (5) *O + CO → *O…CO (6) *O…CO → *…OCO (7) *…OCO → * + CO2 The O2 molecule is adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and activated during the first elementary step (Eq. (1)). This oxygen adsorption (OA) initiates the whole CO oxidation. The Eq. (2) generates the O2 and CO co-adsorbed intermediate, which is adjusted for the following catalytic CO oxidation reaction via oxygen transfer (OT) from O2 to CO, as shown in Eq. (3). The CO2 product departs from the catalyst in the following step and generates the oxygen atom attached catalyst, which adsorbs the second CO molecule via Eq. (5). The subsequent step fulfills the second oxygen transfer from the catalyst to CO fragment and forms the second CO2, which is released via step 7, and then, the catalyst recovers for the next catalytic cycle. Previous investigations have shown that single Fe [18,28–30,39,40] and Cu [41–44] doped nanomaterials present good catalytic activity toward CO oxidation. The electronic structure and energy levels of fullerene can be modified by atomic doping owing to its nanoscale [45]. Subsequently, the catalytic CO oxidations catalyzed by pristine as well as copper and iron doped C60 (C59Cu, C59Fe, and C56Cu2Fe2) are explored with the special emphasis on the following four questions: 1) Can C60 effectively catalyze the oxidation of CO? 2) Does the catalytic activity enhanced upon the single atom doping? 3) Whether does the synergistic effect exist for the bimetallic dopant? 4) How about the efficiency of the doped C60 as compared to other nanomaterials? 2 Computational details The geometrical optimizations are performed by employing the B3LYP functional with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set using the Gaussian 09 program suite [46]. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) [41,47], a continuum solvent model well-developed and widely used in treating solvent effects on molecular properties, is employed. The solvent employed here is water with the dielectric constant (ε) value of 78.35. The transition states of OT are optimized and verified with the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis. The vibrational frequency calculations are fulfilled at the same level to confirm the optimized stationary points as local minima or transition states on the potential energy surfaces (PES). Natural bond orbital (NBO) [48,49] analyses are carried out to obtain information related to charge distribution, charge transfer, and the bonding characteristics along the CO oxidation process. The activation energy (E a) denotes the energy difference between the reactant and the transition state. The adsorption energy (E ad) presents the interaction between substrate and small gas molecule and is calculated using the following expression: E a d = E s s − − E i s − − E s g where E ss, E is, and E sg refer to the energies of the combined substrate-small gas molecule, the isolated substrate, and the small gas molecule, respectively. The negative E ad value indicates that the combined substrate-small gas molecule is more stable and lower in energy than the separated substrate and small gas molecule. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst The optimized geometrical parameters of C60 shown in Fig. 1 (the diameter is 7.1 Å, with the bond lengths close to 1.40 and 1.45 Å, respectively) are in well accordance with the previously reported data [45]. The energy gap of 1.38 eV between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is in agreement with the previous results [45,50]. The doping by single Cu atom extends the bonds and leads to electron rearrangement. The Cu–C bonds lengths in C59Cu are 1.939 and 1.878 Å, respectively (Fig. 1). Distinctive negative NBO charges populate on peripheral carbon atoms (– 0.229 and – 0.251 e) owing to the large positive NBO charges located on central Cu atom (1.038 e). The energy gap reduces upon Cu-doping by 0.54 to 0.84 eV. As compared with the spin multiplicities of 1, 3, 7, 9 for the Fe dopant, C59Fe, the total energy of which is lower distinctly for the spin multiplicities of 5. The corresponding energy gap is 0.80 eV, lower as compared to those of other spin states. The Fe–C bonds lengths in C59Fe are 2.027 and 1.923 Å, respectively, even longer than the Cu-C bonds of the doublet C59Cu. More positive NBO charges locate on Fe atom (1.561 e), accompanied with more negative charges on the neighboring carbon atoms (– 0.338 and – 0.334 e). From the viewpoint of molecular orbital, the combination occurs between the d orbital of Cu/Fe atom and the 3-center-4-electron π bond of C59 (Fig. S1). The HOMO electrons populate primarily around the doped metal atom, in addition, the electropositive region of the electrostatic potential (ESP) locates on metal atom nearby, as favors the following adsorption of CO/O2. The Cu and Fe locate at the paraposition of the six-member-ring in the C56Cu2Fe2 co-dopant (Fig. 1), the multiplicity and the energy gap of which is 9 and 0.488 eV, respectively. The Cu…Fe distance is 2.702 Å and the C=C bonds lengths between these two metal atoms are 1.350 and 1.377 Å, slightly condensed as compared to those in C60. Significant positive NBO charges are observed on both Cu (0.769 e) and Fe (1.421 e) atoms. More negative charges on middle carbon atoms and fewer negative charges on side ones are observed. The HOMO orbital of C56Cu2Fe2 distributes symmetrically in a wide area around both Cu and Fe atoms. 3.2 Oxygen adsorption To reveal whether C60 is capable of catalyzing the CO oxidation, the first step is to investigate the adsorption of CO and O2 on C60. Fig. 2 presents the relative energy variations along with the contact distance of C60 with CO and 3O2 (the triplet state). Here, the sum of energy for isolated CO/3O2 and C60 are taken as respective zero point. During the approaching of CO/3O2 with C60, the geometrical structures of two fragments are kept still. The low barrier (E a: 6.5 kcal/mol) indicates that the approaching of 3O2 to C60 is easy. On the contrary, the high barrier (E a: 35.9 kcal/mol) appearing during the approaching process of CO to C60 demonstrates the difficulty of CO adsorption on C60 framework. In other words, the 3O2 is more convenient to be adsorbed on C60 surface as compared to CO. In addition, the adsorption energy (E ad) of 3O2 is -1.0 kcal/mol, which is lower than that of CO (66.0 kcal/mol). The adsorption energy of O2 and CO are around zero or even positive, which is mainly caused by the geometrical variation as compared with that before adsorption. Although the adsorption of C60 with O2 is strong, as shown in Fig. 2, where the geometrical structure is not changed during the approaching of two fragments. While the variation of geometrical structure breaks the symmetry of C60 and leads to the enhancement of the whole system upon O2 adsorption. Does the oxygen remain the triplet state when it is adsorbed on C60 surface? The potential energy surface (PES) of C60 with the singlet 1O2 has also been scanned (Fig. 2). The relative energies of C60&1O2 are obtained with reference of the sum of isolated 3O2 and C60. When the contact distance of C60 and O2 is large, the energy of C60&1O2 is higher than that of C60&3O2 because the gaseous 3O2 is more stable as compared to 1O2. While the energy of the system decreases distinctly when the contact distance between C60 and 1O2 is shorter than 2.3 Å. The energies of C60&1O2 and C60&3O2 are equal to each other at about 2.0 Å (green point in Fig. 2), and the energy of C60&1O2 decreases rapidly along with further approaching of O2 to C60. During the approaching of C60 and 3O2, the O2 dissociation and the electron reorganization take place. Subsequently, the system changes from the triplet state to the singlet state. Simultaneously, the O2 is activated distinctly, as is evidenced by the extension of O-O distance from 1.214 Å to 1.491 Å. Along with the adsorption of CO/O2, the C1–C2 bond distance (Fig. 3 ) extends from 1.395 Å in C60 to 1.581/1.568 Å in the C60&CO/C60&1O2 complex. The CO/O2 bond length also increases from 1.138/1.214 Å in gaseous state to 1.327/1.491 Å in complex. Two novel bonds are generated with the adsorption of CO/O2, as is reflected by the bond distances of 1.573/1.459 Å and 1.490/1.459 Å. Distinct charge transfer can also be observed with the adsorption of CO, the NBO charges on C/O decreases from 0.508/– 0.508 e in gaseous state to 0.319/– 0.491 e in C60&CO. In general, a net charge of – 0.172 e transfers from C60 to CO moiety. In the case of O2, more NBO electrons shift from C60 to two oxygen atoms (– 0.586 e). The above discussions demonstrate the chemisorption characteristics of CO/O2 on C60 surface. The CO/O2 can also be adsorbed chemically on the surfaces of C59Cu, C59Fe, and C56Cu2Fe2. The chemisorption of CO occurs via the coupling of Cu and carbon terminal of CO (E ad: 7.2 kcal/mol), and the length of generated Cu–C bond is 1.872 Å, a little shorter as compared to the distances of other two Cu–C bonds (1.981 and 1.901 Å). The CO bond length in the doublet C59Cu@CO extends slightly as compared to that in the gaseous state. Positive NBO charges on carbon is larger than the value of negative NBO charges on oxygen, indicating that electron transfers from CO to C59Cu. Totally, there should be three single electrons for the C59Cu@3O2 system (two single electrons on 3O2 and one on C59Cu). Along with the O2 approaching to C59Cu, the O2 dissociation takes place (from 1.214 Å to 1.550 Å), and the system changes from the quartet state to the doublet state. The chemisorption of O2 leads to two novel bond generation (Cu–O (1.812 Å) and C2–O (1.355)) and two bonds broken (O–O (1.550 Å) and Cu–C2 (2.255 Å)). The oxygen atoms are linked by a single covalent bond with Cu and C2, respectively. The corresponding adsorption energy is -7.4 kcal/mol, larger than that of O2 on pure C60. At the same time, a large number of electrons transfer from C59Cu to two oxygen atoms (Fig. S3: – 0.841 e). Correspondingly, distinct positive NBO charges locates on Cu (1.012 e) and C2 (0.234 e) atoms. As indicates that the O2 is greatly activated upon adsorption on the surface of C59Cu, which should be better than C60 to activate O2. The HOMO orbitals shown in Fig. S1 indicate that more HOMO electrons of C59Cu@O2 populate on two oxygen atoms than those of C60@O2. Therefore, the activity of O2 should be enhanced when it is adsorbed on C59Cu surface. The ground state of C59Fe is quintet because there are four single electrons. For the adsorption of CO on C59Fe, the geometrical and charge population variations, as well as the E ad (10.1 kcal/mol) are similar to those on C59Cu. Slight positive NBO charges can be observed on CO (0.053 e). While the adsorption of O2 on C59Fe generates only one Fe–O bond (1.854 Å), and the distance of another O with C2 is 3.296 Å. The E ad of O2 on C59Fe is 8.6 kcal/mol, a little less than that of CO. The distance of Fe–C2 is condensed to 1.799 Å, even shorter as compared to that in C59Fe&CO. Therefore, on the contrary with C59Cu, the adsorption extends O–O bond distance by only ∼ 0.1 Å as compared to that of 3O2 because of the strengthening of Fe–C2 interaction. Different with the 4s valency electrons in the outermost electron shell of Cu atom, the 3d electrons of Fe are not so easy to be transferred. Totally, there are 0.519 e transferred from C59Fe to O2. Judging from the viewpoint of geometrical and NBO charge, the catalytic activity of C60 should not be changed distinctly upon Fe doping. There are ten single electrons (four on every Fe and one on every Cu) in the ground state of co-doped C56Cu2Fe2. The CO chemisorption occurs on co-doped C56Cu2Fe2 with a large E ad (-30.5 kcal/mol) and the Fe…C distance of 1.964 Å (Fig. 3), a little longer as compared to those in the former three cases. This adsorption strengthens the C=C interaction between Cu and Fe atoms, reflected by the reduction of bond length from 1.377 Å to 1.356 Å. A few positive NBO charges (0.063 e) shift to the adsorbed CO molecule. When O2 is chemically adsorbed on co-doped C56Cu2Fe2, the E ad is -48.7 kcal/mol, larger than that of CO. Two oxygen atoms act as bridge between Cu and Fe, with the Cu–O and Fe–O distances of 1.862 and 1.938 Å, respectively. The O–O bond length is extended by ∼ 0.14 Å from 1.214 Å in the gaseous state. The positive NBO charges located on Cu and Fe increases with the electrons (0.632 e) transfer to two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the O2 is more activated on the surface of co-doped C56Cu2Fe2 than C60 and C59Fe. 3.3 1st CO adsorption The above discussions illustrate that the O2 chemisorption on both C60 and three dopants is followed by the adsorption of CO. The carbon terminal of CO interacts directly with the oxygen atom in both C60 and C59Cu, with the C…O contact distance about 3.0 Å (Fig. 4 ). While in C59Fe and C56Cu2Fe2, CO interacts with Fe atom via the oxygen terminal with a longer Fe…O contact distance about 3.6 Å. The influence of adsorption to CO is slight, reflected by the unchanged C=O bond length and the NBO charge population (Fig. S3). Similarly, the effect of CO adsorption (CA) is weak on the frameworks of O2 adsorbed C60 and dopants except C59Cu. The CA broke the original O-O bond (extending from 1.550 Å to 2.896 Å) of C59Cu&O2, accompanied by the formation of triatomic CuOC2 bridging and the transfer of electron from C2 to the bridging O atom (from – 0.320 e to – 0.578 e). The IR spectra may provide useful information about the characteristic that the CO molecule is adsorbed physically or chemically on C60 or the dopant. When it is adsorbed on C60, the CO stretching vibration (υs(C=O)) reduces to 2200 cm−1, almost equal to that of independent CO molecule (2204 cm−1) (Fig. 5 ). For the C59Cu dopant, the υs(C=O) value reduces to 2199 cm−1. While in both C59Fe and C56Cu2Fe2 dopants, the frequency at 2205 cm−1 is assigned as the stretching of C=O bond. In addition, a distinct peak around 1000 ∼ 1700 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching of C=O bond of ketone group (υs(C=O)t), which is generated by adsorbed O2 and fullerene framework. Energetically, the co-adsorption of CO and O2 on C60 is exothermic by – 5.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 6 ). The Cu doping decreases this value significantly to – 55.2 kcal/mol, as releases more energies and facilitates the following oxidation of CO. While for the C59Fe dopant, the co-adsorption is endothermic by 5.1 kcal/mol, illustrating that the Fe doping is disadvantageous for the co-adsorption of CO and O2 as compared to that of C60. As for the bimetallic C56Cu2Fe2 dopant, the co-adsorption is exothermic by – 12.8 kcal/mol owing to the accumulation of exothermic OA and endothermic CA. Therefore, the Cu doping favors the co-adsorption of CO and O2. 3.4 1st Oxygen transfer Following the co-adsorption of O2 & CO, the oxygen atom attaching on C1 of C60 transfers to CO and generates the first CO2 molecule, which interacts with C60 via C and O atoms. Simultaneously, the remaining oxygen atom forms the COC triatomic ring with C60. Distinct electron transfer from carbon to oxygen atoms can be observed (Fig. S4). Totally, there are -0.724 e are transferred from C60 to CO2 and the remaining oxygen. Although this oxygen transfer (OT) is a thermodynamically exothermic process (– 48.1 kcal/mol), the high activation energy (E a: 72.3 kcal/mol) for this OT implies the difficulty of the first CO oxidation. Along with the OT, the contact distance between the generated CO2 and C59Cu extends to 2.134 Å, and electron transfer is observed distinctly back to the C59Cu framework (Table 1 : ∼ – 0.54 e). Fig. 6 shows that the OT catalyzed by C59Cu is an exothermic reaction with the energy reduction by – 72.9 kcal/mol and a low barrier of 2.1 kcal/mol. This low barrier is easy to overcome owing to the previous exothermic process of CO & O2 co-adsorption. Therefore, the activation of the first OT is enhanced significantly upon Cu doping. It is lower than the barriers of catalytic CO oxidation in Fe or Cu doped graphene systems, where the barrier ranges from 14.3 to 4.8 kcal/mol [51–59]. This barrier is also lower as compared with the barriers (ranging around 8.0 kcal/mol) recently reported in other systems [60–63]. The generated CO2 interacts with C59Fe via the terminal oxygen, with the contact distance of 2.320 Å (Fig. 4), a little longer than that of C59Cu. Accompanied with this OT, the other oxygen acts as a bridge joining Fe and C2 atoms. The distance between these two atoms extends from 1.870 Å to 2.095 Å upon OT. The electron shifts distinctly from the transferred oxygen to the bridging one (Fig. S3: ∼ 0.30 e). A lot of energy (– 107.3 kcal/mol) is released during this OT process owing to the formation of CO2 and the bridging structure. The corresponding energy barrier (E a) is 42.7 kcal/mol. In co-dopant, the OT breaks the Fe-O-O-Cu bridge and generates novel Fe-O-Cu triangle structure (Fig. 4). The corresponding Fe-Cu bond length is condensed obviously from 3.070 Å to 2.670 Å. The contact distance between the generated CO2 and the framework of C56Cu2Fe2 is 3.556 Å, longer as compared to those of C59Cu and C59Fe. Along with this OT, distinct electron transfer is also observed from the generated CO2 to the bridging oxygen (Fig. S4: – 0.789 e). This OT is also an exothermic step with the energy variation of – 78.9 kcal/mol and the corresponding E a is 46.3 kcal/mol. The generated CO2 is chemisorption on C60 while physisorption on three dopants. As is typically reflected by the IR spectra (Fig. 5). A distinct peak around 1900 cm−1 in C60 system shows the characteristic of carbonyl group. While in three dopants, the generated CO2 interacts with the dopant via weak electrostatic interaction. Therefore, the characteristic peak of CO2 can be observed around 2410 cm−1. 3.5 1st CO2 desorption The desorption of generated CO2 from C60 need to break the bonds between CO2 and the framework, leading to significant electron shift (Table 1: > 0.2 e) from CO2 fragment back to C60. The C1-C2 bond length decreases from 1.511 Å to 1.383 Å, changing from the single bond to the double bond. This is an exothermic process, with the energy decrease of – 37.6 kcal/mol. In addition, along with the desorption of CO2, the characteristic peak of which disappears in the IR spectra (Fig. 5). In this conformation, there are still 0.539 e transferred from the C60 to the oxygen atom. It means that the C60 is oxidized partially. The CO2 desorption from C59Cu leads to the reduction of Cu…O distances by 0.05 Å. The geometrical changes of C59Cu upon CO2 desorption are weak as compared to those of C60, where, the CO2 is chemically adsorbed. Energetically, the CO2 desorption from C59Cu is an endothermic step (6.1 kcal/mol). Similarly, the influence of CO2 desorption to both the geometrical structures and the energies of C59Fe and C59CuFe is slight owing to their physisorption characteristic of CO2. In these three structures, distinct negative NBO charges (Fig. S4: ∼ 0.6 e) are observed on O. It denotes that significant electron transfer occurs from the dopants to the oxygen. Therefore, these dopants are oxidized partially. 3.6 2nd CO adsorption The 2nd CO can be adsorbed on C60 framework with the terminal carbon coupling with the remaining oxygen atom (Or). The physisorption characteristic is typically shown by both large C…Or contact distance of 3.193 Å and unchanged geometrical structures of both fragments (Fig. 4). The NBO charges populated on both CO and C60 framework changes slightly (Table 1). The small E ad value (– 2.4 kcal/mol) for this CO also illustrates its physisorption feature. For the C59Cu dopant, the 2nd CO is adsorbed on Cu atom with the Cu-C bond length of 1.893 Å. Following the 2nd CA, the distances of Cu…O and Cu-C1 extends from 1.960 Å and 1.904 Å to 2.040 Å and 1.942 Å, respectively. The electrons shift from the surrounding atoms to the central Cu atom, as is evidenced by the elevated negative NBO charges on CO, bridging oxygen, and C1 atoms, as well as the decreased positive number on Cu atom (Fig. S4). The chemisorption nature is also demonstrated with the large E ad value (– 23.0 kcal/mol) (Fig. 6). In the case of C59Fe, the adsorption of the 2nd CO molecule is weak, as is illustrated by the large contact distances of Fe…O (3.596 Å) and C…Or (3.578 Å) shown in Fig. 4. The unaltered geometrical structures as well as the NBO charge population of the C59Fe framework and CO molecule also indicate the characteristic of physisorption. The adsorption energy is only – 1.7 kcal/mol, even less than that on C60. Similar to C59Fe, the CA on bimetallic dopant is physisorption in nature. As is demonstrated by the large contact distance, the unchanged geometrical structure, the NBO charge population of both CO and C56Cu2Fe2 framework (Fig. 4), as well as the small Ead (– 2.0 kcal/mol). Moreover, the characteristic peak of CO appears around 2200 cm−1 along with the CA for all these four cases. As also reflects the physisorption feature of the 2nd CO (Fig. 5). 3.7 2nd Oxygen transfer Subsequently, the remaining oxygen transfers to the CO fragment and generates the second CO2 molecule. As for C60, the generated CO2 interacts with the framework via the C-C (1.549 Å) and O-C2 (1.498 Å) covalent bonds (Fig. 4). This OT leads to the original C=O bond extension by ∼ 0.06 Å, the distinct C2-C bond condense from 2.155 Å to 1.611 Å, obvious electron transfers from CO2 to C60, and significant energy release by – 23.2 kcal/mol. Although this is an exothermic process, the E a is 74.5 kcal/mol (Fig. 6), even higher than that of the first OT step. In the case of C59Cu, the generated CO2 interacts via the terminal oxygen atom with Cu. The contact distance between CO2 and C59Cu is 2.149 Å. The transfer of this bridging oxygen leads to significant electron transfer from Cu to C2 and regenerates the Cu-C2 covalent bond (1.890 Å). The transfer of bridging oxygen is an endothermic process, as is reflected by the large reaction heat (22.6 kcal/mol) and the high E a (42.7 kcal/mol), shown in Fig. 6. It is different with the exothermic reactions on C60, C59Fe, and C56Cu2Fe2 catalysts. Furthermore, the previous elementary steps on C59Cu are all exothermic (Fig. 6). The energy needed to overcome this barrier can be obtained from the previous exothermic elementary steps. Thermodynamically, the forward CO oxidation prefers to the backward CO desorption. While for the Fe dopant, the 2nd OT abstracts the bridging oxygen and reforms the Fe-C2 bond (1.769 Å). The contact distance between CO2 and C59Fe is 2.161 Å, a little longer as compared to that in Cu dopant. Distinct electrons transfer from the generated CO2 fragment to C2 and Fe atoms. This OT on C59Fe is an exothermic process, with the energy variation of – 21.3 kcal/mol and a barrier of 46.8 kcal/mol. The 2nd OT in C56Cu2Fe2 breaks the Fe-O-Cu bridging. The generated CO2 interacts with the bimetallic dopant via the Cu…O coupling, with the contact distance of 2.343 Å. Similarly, electron transfers distinctly from the CO2 fragment to the bimetallic framework (Fig. 4). This OT also corresponds an exothermic process with the energy variation of –33.6 kcal/mol and the high E a (84.3 kcal/mol). The OT is accompanied by the consume of CO and the generation of CO2, as is reflected by the characteristic peak vanish around 2200 cm−1 and the emergence around 2400 cm−1 for three dopants. While for the C60 system, the formed CO2 is chemisorbed on the framework, as leads to the distinct red-shift of υs(C=O) by 500 cm−1. 3.8 2nd CO2 desorption The system recovers with the 2nd CO2 desorption. In pristine C60 system, the desorption need break two covalent bonds between CO2 and C60. The variations of the corresponding geometrical structure and the NBO charge populations upon CO2 desorption are distinct. Therefore, there should be a high barrier for CO2 desorption from C60, which would not be applied as the CO oxidation catalyst. The CO2 is physically adsorbed on the metallic dopant, therefore, the desorption should be easier as compared to that of C60, and the effect on geometrical structures of the framework is slight. While, the disappear of O…Fe interaction along with the CO2 desorption leads to distinct electron shifting from Fe to surrounding C atoms. It is reflected distinctly by the disappear of υs(C=O) in the IR spectra. The CO2 desorption is an exothermic process with significant energies released: – 30.7 kcal/mol for C60, – 25.0 kcal/mol for C59Cu, – 22.1 kcal/mol for C59Fe, and – 19.3 kcal/mol for C56Cu2Fe2, respectively (Fig. 6). 4 Conclusions In summary, the catalytic CO oxidation mechanism catalyzed by C60 are explored. The system varies from the triplet state to the singlet state with the adsorption of O2, which is followed by CO adsorption. The oxidation of the first CO corresponds the rate-determining step, the barrier of which can be lowered by either Cu or Fe doping distinctly, while the adsorption of CO and O2 on Fe dopant is endothermic. Significant electron transfer from the C59Cu dopant activates the O2 and CO molecules, then decreases the barrier of CO oxidation and accelerates the reaction rate. The activity of bimetallic dopant, C56Cu2Fe2, is better than that of C60, while the CO adsorption hinders the following oxidation. The C59Cu dopant is an efficient catalyst for catalytic CO oxidation owing to the low-barrier (2.1 kcal/mol) CO oxidation reaction. It would be a potential material to solve the environmental protection problems and to purify the H2 for fuel cell applications.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic CO oxidation under mild conditions attracts extensive interests. The exploration about the catalytic CO oxidation mechanism illustrates that the conversion from the triplet state to the singlet state takes place during the adsorption of O2, which is followed by CO adsorption. The barrier of the first CO oxidation, which corresponds to the rate-determining step, can be lowered distinctly by Cu-doping. A quartet-to-doublet spin crossing facilitates the CO oxidation by C59Cu. Significant electron transfer from the C59Cu dopant activates the O2 and CO molecules, then decreases the barrier and accelerates the reaction rate. The C59Cu dopant is an efficient catalyst for CO oxidation owing to the low-barrier (2.1 kcal/mol) CO oxidation reaction. It would be a potential material in solving the environmental protection problems and the purification of H2 for fuel cell applications",
