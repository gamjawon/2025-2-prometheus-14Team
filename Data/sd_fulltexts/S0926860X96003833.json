Weyrich, W.F. H61derich* Department of Chemical Technology and Heterogeneous Catalysis, University of Technology RWTH Aachen, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany Received 12 June 1996; received in revised form 23 October 1996; accepted 25 October 1996 Abstract The dehydrogenation of the natural terpene ~-limonene to the industrially important p-cymene was studied over zeolite supported Pd catalysts. Transalkylation of the product p-cymene can be avoided by employing a medium-pore ZSM-5 catalyst via the well known product selectivity. The addition of a Ce promoter leads to an enhanced p-cymene selectivity and a slower catalyst deactivation. Surprisingly deactivation can be drastically reduced by the addition of hydrogen to the carrier gas. 1. Introduction p-Cymene is an important starting material for the production of intermediates such as p-cresol and can also be used in the manufacturing of fragrances, herbicides, pharmaceuticals and heat transfer media [1-3]. Conventionally, cym- enes are synthesized by Friedel-Crafis-alkylation of toluene with propene using hazardous catalysts such as A1C13 [4]. Moreover, the process only leads to mixtures of cymene isomers in thermodynamic equilibrium composition. Recently, selective synthesis of p-cymene from toluene and propene or iso- propanol over zeolite catalysts has been thoroughly investigated [5-7]. Zeolite based processes avoid the disposal of spent catalyst, product contamination by the catalyst, seperation of the catalyst from the product and corrosion of the reactor and tubes. The results using various zeolite types were promising. However, the formation of undesired n-propyltoluene in addition to p-cymene is observed particularly in the presence of MFI type zeolites, whereas large pore zeolites * Corresponding author.

Weyrich, W.E HOlderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 yield significant amounts of m- and o-cymene besides the desired p-cymene. However, low conversion and relatively low selectivity are the drawbacks of these investigations. Other approaches to selectively synthesize p-cymene start from ot-limonene, a material with the same carbon structure as p-cymene, ct-Limonene is widely available as a cheap by-product in the orange juice production and paper industry. In earlier studies [8,9] it was shown that ot-limonene can be disproportionated to p- menthane and p-cymene over Pt and Pd catalysts on carrier materials. According to the formula ct-limonene p-menthane p-cymene 33% of the ot-limonene is lost as a saturated compound. Also, Se promoted PdO on charcoal as carrier material has been suggested [10]. However, such a catalyst is not favourable environmentally. Recently, W.E Hoelderich et al. [ 11 ] reported zeolite supported, Ce promoted Pd catalysts for enhanced dehydrogenation activity during c~-limonene conversion. Thereby, they used preferably weakly acidic boron-pentasil zeolites and obtained p-cymene yields around 85%. With respect to the service time of the disclosed catalyst, no comments have been made. Therefore, in contrast, our investigations have been based on neutral ZSM-5 carrier i.e. in the Na-form. The scope of this work was to study the impact of zeolite structure, acidity and catalyst preparation method on c~-limonene conversion and p-cymene selectivity as well as catalyst lifetime. Thereby, medium-pore ZSM-5 zeolites and large pore faujasite zeolites have been employed to study the effect of different zeolite geometry on shape selectivity. Zeolites ZSM-5 with SIO2/A1203 ratios of 27 and 55, respectively, have been ion-exchanged with various amounts of Ce and Pd to study product composition and time-on-stream behaviour in dependence of reaction temperature and metal content. Finally, the impact of hydrogen addition to the feed upon catalyst lifetime was investigated in a long term run of 600 h. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts A series of catalysts was prepared from zeolites H-US-Y (CBV760, SiO2/ A1203=7,6), H-ZSM-5-55 (A1Si-Penta-SH55, SIO2/A1203=55), Na-ZSM-5-55 (A1Si-Penta-SN55, SIO2/A1203=55) and Na-ZSM-5-27 (A1Si-Penta-SN27, SIO2/A1203=27).

Weyrich, W.E H61derich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 147 Table 1 Zeolite catalysts used in the reaction Sample SIO2/A1203 Content of Pd (wt.%) Content of Ce (wt.%) H-US-Y 7.6 - - H-ZSM-5-55-1 55 - - H-ZSM-5-55-2 55 1 - H-ZSM-5-55-3 55 1 2 Na-ZSM-5-55-1 55 1 2 Na-ZSM-5-55-2 55 4 2 Na-ZSM-5-27-0 27 - - Na-ZSM-5-27-1 27 1 - Na-ZSM-5-27-2 27 1 2.4 Na-ZSM-5-27-3 27 - 2.4 AG is greatly appreciated. Prior to use in catalysis and ion-exchange, the zeolites have been formed to split of 1.0-1.6 mm. In the case of powder zeolitic materials, this powder was extruded, dried at 110, calcined in air at 550 and crushed to obtain the desired particle size. All zeolites have been used as such for catalysis. Additionally ZSM-5 have been ion-exchanged with Pd or Ce and Pd in various amounts. It has been reported that rare earth metals can act as anchors for noble metals and so does Ce [12,13] avoiding Pd-cluster-formation. More details about the dispersion of Pd and the particle size will be published elsewhere [14]. The metal content of the different catalysts is given in Table 1. Ce and Pd containing zeolites have always been obtained by ion-exchange with Ce at first. Thereby 800 ml of a 0.1 M Ce(NO3)3-solution are circulated over 80 g of the zeolite particles at 80 for 24 h. The zeolite was subsequently filtered, washed with 2 1 doubly deionized (DDI) water, dried in air at 110 overnight and calcined in air at 550 for 6 h. The Ce-exchange was performed three times. Ce content was determined by X-Ray-Fluorescence-Analysis (RFA) to 2.0% for zeolites H-ZSM-5-55 and Na-ZSM-5-27 and 2.4% for zeolite Na-ZSM-5-27. Pd-exchange of the pure or the Ce-exchanged zeolites has been carried out in the same way by circulating 800 ml of a Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2-solution with the desired amount of Pd over 20 g of the zeolite for 24 h at 80. The catalyst was subsequently filtered, washed with 2 1 DDI-water, dried in air at room temperature (RT) and stored until used. The metal loading was determined by atomic absorp- tion analysis (AAS). The results are given in Table 1. All Pd containing catalysts were calcined under static conditions in air by ramping the temperature from RT to 550 with 2 K min-1 in an oven. The catalysts were then held at 550 for 6 h and subsequently cooled down to RT. For comparison, a fraction of Pd-exchanged Na-ZSM-5-27-1 and Na-ZSM-5-27-2 were calcined in situ in a flow of pure oxygen (2000 ml 02 gcalt, min-1) by slowly ramping the temperature with 0.5 K min-1 from RT to 550. The catalysts were then held at 550 for 2 h and subsequently cooled down to RT in flowing N2. The samples are denoted Na-ZSM-5-27-1-ox and Na-ZSM-5-27-2-ox, respectively. 148 P.A. Weyrich, W.E Hrlderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 All Pd containing catalysts were reduced in a pure hydrogen stream in situ prior to reaction by ramping the temperature with 8 K min-1 from RT to 230 and then with 1 K min-1 from 230 to 250. The temperature was held at 250 for 20 min. Afterwards, the catalysts were brought to reaction temperature in a N2 stream. 2.2. ct-Limonene conversion ~t-Limonene conversion was studied in an integral reactor at temperatures bet- ween 200 and 300. The catalysts were placed as split of 1.0-1.6 mm diameter in a stainless steel reactor with an internal diameter of 6 mm. 3.2 g of catalyst was used for each run. ot-Limonene with a purity of 97% (3% other terpenes, kindly provided by Firmenich SA) was brought into the reactor inlet by means of a metric pump at a rate of 5 ml h-1. The feed evaporated at the reactor inlet and the vapor was transported in the presence of 4 N1 h-1 N2 over the catalyst bed. The resulting ~t-limonene partial pressure in the feed was 16 kPa, the resulting WHSV was 1.3 h-1. On-line analysis of the products was done in a Siemens RGC 202 system, equipped with a 50 m OV 1701 CS column and a flame ionization detector. Calculation of conversion and selectivities are based on wt.% of starting materials and products. Shape selectivity q~ is defined as the ratio of desired p- cymene to m-cymene. The former has the same carbon structure as ~t-limonene, the latter is a skeletal isomer of it. Values of cp are around 0.5 for p-/m-cymol mixtures in thermodynamic equilibrium between 200 and 300. Computer modeling will be published elsewhere [15]. 2.3. Pyridine adsorption Pyridine (Py) adsorption of pure and metal-exchanged Na-ZSM-5-55 has been observed in a reaction cell. The samples were calcined in situ at 550 and subsequently cooled to RT. Py was sorbed at 80 from the gas phase. Spectra have been recorded on a Nicolet 510p spectrometer. The absorption band at ~1445 cm-~ was ascribed to the coordinately bonded Py (Lewis-sites), and the band at 1545 cm-~ was attributed to the protonated Py form (Br0nsted-sites). The 1492 cm-1 absorption band corresponded to Py sorbed on both L- and B-sites. The experimental results are given in Fig. 6. 3. Results 3.1. Conversion over unmodified H-ZSM-5 and H-US-Y The influence of the pore structure of the zeolites on the product distribution of m- and p-cymene isomers has been studied in the presence of the unmodified shape PA.

Using these acidic zeolites only a low amount of cymenes is obtained. A lot of side and consecutive reactions occur forming Diels-Alder products, polymers, cleavage products, such as toluene, propane, propene and coke deposition. The results can be seen in Table 2. The value of cp ranges from 50 at 200 to 11.1 at 300 for a-limonene conversion over zeolite H-ZSM-5-55-1 after 0.5 h time on stream (TOS). At both tempera- tures, the unmodified H-ZSM-5-55-1 deactivates fast, at lower temperature even faster. This can be attributed to pore blockage and lower diffusion coefficients and deactivation of acid sites by coke deposition. Also, the content of m-cymene in the product decreases with TOS and no m- cymene was found after 4 h TOS for both temperatures. The product composition change from initially large amounts of cleavage products (toluene and C3-C8 alkanes), isomerized C10H16 terpenes and coke precursors (~C20, not further identified) to mainly isomerized C10H16 terpenes after a few hours on stream (see Table 3). The relation between cymene selectivity and acidity of the zeolite is remarkable. A low acidic H-ZSM-5 promotes the conversion of ct-limonene to isomerized CloH16 terpenes - no dehydrogenation to p-cymene is noticed. An increase of the acidity of the zeolite increases the dehydrogenation properties of H-ZSM-5. Employing the large pore zeolite H-US-Y yields cp in the range from 1.3 at 200 to 0.55 at 300 after 0.5 h on stream. The latter value is close to the thermo- dynamic equilibrium value of p-/m-cymene mixtures of 0.5. The conversion is higher for H-US-Y zeolites than for H-ZSM-5-55-1. However, the p-menthane structure is almost completely destroyed at 300. With increasing TOS, p- cymene selectivity increases on account of decreased cleavage to toluene and 150 P.A.

Also, q~ increases with increasing TOS, most likely due to poisoning of the acid sites responsible for the dealkylation and skeletal isomerization as well as due to the enhancement of the shape selectivity by coke formation narrowing the pore size. Increase of cymene selectivity and q~ is slower at 300 which can be attributed to the faster desorption of the reaction products from the acid sites at higher temperatures. The product distribution for a period of 16 h over unmodified H-ZSM-5-55-1 at a temperature of 250 is shown in Table 3. Conversion of ~t-limonene dropped from 99.5% after 20 min to 64.3% in 16 h. Selectivity to p-cymene decreases from 18.1% to 2.5%. The decrease of cleavage products, mainly toluene and propane, which are formed via a clearly acid catalyzed reaction, from initially 26.2% to 0.3% after 16 h indicate the fast deactivation of the acid sites of the catalyst. In contrary, the amount of the terpenes is constantly increasing, i.e. the catalyst lost its dehydrogenation properties. No steady state behaviour was obtained during the screened period. 3.2. Conversion over Pd modified H-ZSM-5 The formation of the aromatic system from ot-limonene is obtained by dehy- drogenation in the presence of strong acid sites of H-ZSM-5. But, in such a case we found a very strong deactivation. However, working with Pd-Na-ZSM-5 with weak acidity, the dehydrogenation is catalyzed by the metallic type reaction of Pd. Selectivity to form dehydrogenated product i.e. p-cymene was very low in the case of pure unmodified H-ZSM-5-55-1, with initially 18.1%. Therefore, the dehydrogenation activity has to be enhanced by e.g. insertion of noble metals. The product distribution of a-limonene conversion for a period of 6 h over Pd- exchanged H-ZSM-5-55-2 is shown in Table 4. The pretreatment of the catalyst is described in Section 2.1. P.A. Weyrich, W.E Hi~lderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 151 Table 4 ot-limonene conversion over Pd containing H-ZSM-5-55-2, 1 wt.% Pd, temperature 250, p=l bar, carrier N2 4 N1 h-1, WHSV=I.3 h l TOS (h) 02 1 2 4 6 Conversion (%) 99.8 98.8 95.3 93.6 92.4 Selectivity (%) p-cymene 16.9 8.2 5.6 4.7 3.8 Em-, o-cymene 1.2 0.7 0.3 0 0 E ct-, 7-terpinene 22.5 36.6 44.3 49.7 54.3 Terpinolene 2.3 5.0 7.2 12.2 14.5 Other CloHl6-terpenes 12.0 16.5 16,9 18.1 18.1 E p-menthane, p-menthene 13.1 6.3 4.1 2.9 2.2 Coke precursor (_>C2o) 3.7 2.4 1.9 1.1 0.8 Cracked products (toluene + 28.3 24.3 19.7 11.3 6.3 lower alkanes, propanes) The product distribution resembles that of the pure H-ZSM-5-55-1. ot-Limonene conversion decreases from almost complete conversion of 99.8% to 92.4% after 6 h time on stream (TOS). Dehydrogenation activity monitored by the p-cymene selectivity drops from 16.9% to 3.8% after 6 h. Thus, the loss of hydrogen transfer activity results in an increase of isomerized C10H16 terpenes from 36.8% to 86.9% after 6 h. The share of terpinolene, a product of the isomerization of the isopropylene group of ot-limonene, on the C10H16 terpenes in the product mixture rises with increasing TOS. Accordingly, the ratio of terpinolene to ct- and 7- terpinene, products of the double bond shift into the cyclohexene ring increases from 0.1 to 0.3 after 6 h, indicating an ongoing decline of the acid sites responsible for the isomerization. ct-limonene terpinolene y-terpinene ct-terpinen Other C10H16-terpenes of p-menthadiene structure, e.g. ot-phellandrene, 13- phellandrene, iso-limonene etc, have been detected in the GC-MS analysis, but could not be identified and so cannot be used for further evaluation. To summarise, one can say that the Pd-sites of the catalyst promote the dehydroisomerization to p-cymene, whereas the acid sites of the catalyst promote a ring-opening and cracking to cleavage products. Therefore for short TOS (<2 h) cracking of p-cymene to toluene and propane/propene on the acid sites is the dominant reaction. With increasing TOS, the acid sites of the catalyst deactivate and thus, the formation of cleavage products decreases. 152 P.A.

Conversion over Pd/Ce modified H-ZSM-5 The addition of rare earth metals to the catalyst system is a means of promoting the noble metal function. It has been reported that rare earth metals can act as anchors for noble metals and thus enhance dispersion and accessibility of noble metal sites in a zeolite [12,13]. The product distribution for ct-limonene conversion over Ce exchanged, and then Pd exchanged H-ZSM-5-55-3 is given in Table 5. p-Cymene selectivity is drastically enhanced when adding a Ce promoter, ct- Limonene conversion decreases from 99.8% to 98.0% after 6 h which is slower than the decrease from 99.8% to 92.4% for the unpromoted catalyst H-ZSM-5-55-2 over the same period of time. Initial p-cymene selectivity is up to 50.1% vs 16.9% for the unpromoted catalyst. However, p-cymene selectivity decreases to 25.9% after 6 h time on stream. The reaction seems to reach a steady state at about 2 h on stream. Still, rapid deactivation of both acid sites as well as Pd sites is evident during the first 2 h time on stream, indicated by the decline of p-cymene and the decrease of cleavage products. The initial amount of 19.2% of such products is indicating that the catalyst is much too strongly acidic and catalyzes not only formation of unwanted split by-products from ~t-limonene but also leads to deactivation of the Pd sites due to coke deposition as was evidenced by coke precursors in the product distribution and a colour change of the catalyst from light grey to black. 3.4. Conversion over Pd/Ce modified Na-ZSM-5 Surprisingly, employing a non acidic Na-ZSM-5 as support for Pd catalyst and Ce promotor does not reduce the formation of dealkylated by-products (Table 6).

However, number and strengths of acid sites should be lower for the ion exchanged Na-ZSM-5-55-1 than for its counterpart H-ZSM-5-55-3. We have also made this observation and it will be discussed later (Section 3.8 and Fig. 6). The product distribution for tx-limonene conversion over Pd/Ce modified Na- ZSM-5-55-1 for a period of 48 h is given in Table 6 and Fig. 1. The initial amount of cracked products formed is 67.5%, compared to only 19.2% for the acidic support H-ZSM-5-55-3 (Table 5). However, the amount of cracked products decreases significantly to 6.1% in the first 8 h time on stream. Since cracking is a secondary reaction on the acid sites of the catalyst, starting preferably from p- cymene, an increase of p-cymene selectivity is observed with declining cracking activity. Hydrogen transfer is initially complete, no CloH16 isomers are found in the product. However, the Pd sites deactivate slowly, as evidenced by an increase of CloH16-isomers. For short TOS (<8 h), deactivation of acid sites is dominant, whereas for a longer TOS (>8 h), deactivation of Pd sites (incomplete hydrogen transfer) becomes more important. The first effect leads to rising p-cymene selectivities, whereas the second effect yields lower p-cymene selectivities. Thus, p-cymene selectivity goes through a maximum at about 8 h with a maximum value of 80.8%. Interestingly, the maximum for hydrogenated substances p-menthene, CloH18, and p-menthane, CloH2o, is at about 36 h, thus not strictly related to the 154 P.A. Weyrich, W.F.

Therefore, the ratio of p-cymene to p-menthenes and p- menthanes cannot be defined by the thermodynamic equilibrium, but is kinetically controlled. Although initially p-cymene is dealkylated to large amounts, only traces of m- cymene are found initially. No skeletal isomerization is observed after 2 h time on stream, indicating that the acid catalyzed reactions take place inside the zeolite pores. Also, coke precursors can only be found in the first stages of the reaction. 3.5. Conversion over Na-ZSM-5 catalyst having various Pd/Ce content The Pd loading of the catalysts does not affect the product distribution significantly. Conversion and p-cymene selectivity curves for metal loadings of 2% Ce, 1% Pd (Na-ZSM-5-55-1) and 2% Ce, 4% Pd (Na-ZSM-5-55-2) are given in Fig. 2. Initial p-cymene selectivity for reaction over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-55-2 with a Pd content of 4% is around 10%, compared to 30.4% over catalyst Na-ZSM-55-1 with a lower Pd content of 1%. Accordingly, cracked by-products add up to 85% over Na-ZSM-5-55-2 compared to 67.5% over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-55-1. Accord- ing to formula (2), each Pd ion generates two protons in the zeolite. Thus, a higher cracking activity of zeolites can be expected to result from a higher metal content. Product distribution of ~x-limonene conversion over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-2 based on a zeolite support with a lower SIO2/A1203 ratio of 27 is given in Table 7. It is apparent that the selectivity to cracked products at the initial stages of the reaction is by far less prominent for the catalyst with a lower SIO2/A1203 ratio. The amount of cracked products is only 9.7% as compared to 67.5% for the conversion over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-55-1 having stronger acid sites than Na-ZSM-5-27-2. Due to the difference in cracked products, p-cymene selectivity is initially higher with 66.7% for Na-ZSM-5-27-2 vs. 30.4% over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-55-1. The amount P.A.

Thus, the ratio of p-cymene/E(p-menthene, p-menthane) is about 19 for catalyst Na-ZSM- 27-1 vs. 3.1 for catalyst Na-ZSM-5-55-1. This indicates again that dehydrogena- tion/hydrogenation reaction is controlled kinetically. 3.6. Influence of calcination The catalytic performance of noble metal exchanged zeolites is strongly dependent upon activation methods following the ion-exchange. Careful calcina- tion methods in pure oxygen have been suggested to enhance the noble metal dispersion. The treatment of the ion-exchanged and dried zeolites by ramping with 156 P.A.

The impact of careful calcination and reduction methods upon ct-limonene conversion over Pd as well as Ce and Pd containing zeolites is demonstrated in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The situation of these two catalysts is entirely different compared to Pd only exchanged zeolite Na-ZSM-5-27-1-ox (carefully calcined in oxygen) and zeolite Na-ZSM-5-27-1 (calcined in air in a static atmosphere). The selectivity towards p-cymene dependent upon TOS for these catalysts is shown in Fig. 3. The initial selectivity to p-cymene is almost 4 times as high (56.7% vs. 14.2%) over careful calcined catalyst than over its counterpart calcined in air for a given ct-limonene conversion of 100%. After 18 h time on stream, the difference is even more prominent with selectivity top-cymene being 13.6 times as high (64.0% vs. 4.7%).

Weyrich, W.E H6lderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 157 Pd sites. We assume that large Pd clusters exist in the Pd-exchanged zeolite after calcination in air. Thus, the accessible surface of the Pd particles is smaller than well dispersed Pd, as presumably obtained via careful calcination in oxygen. For the catalyst exchanged at first with Ce and then with Pd, differences in the product distribution can hardly be found for the period of 18 h. The only difference is a slightly higher selectivity towards p-cymene in the first stages of the reaction for the careful, with oxygen calcined catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-2-ox, compared to the catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-2, which was calcined in air in a static atmosphere. TOS behaviour is shown in Fig. 4. The difference is due to a slightly lower initial cracking activity. After 2 h time on stream, both curves are within the range of the experimental error. Thus, employing careful calcination procedures does hardly affect Ce promoted Pd catalysts. Product distributions for ~t-limonene conversion over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-2 are shown in Table 7. By the use of catalyst Na- ZSM-5-27-2-ox, similar results have been found which are therefore not listed here [16]. The calcination effect on Pd/Ce modified Na-ZSM-5 has less influence on the catalyst performance than in the case of Pd modified Na-ZSM-5. That means the Ce has a stabilising effect on the dispersion of the Pd on the catalyst carrier. Ce- doping makes the calcination procedure less difficult and sensitive. 3.7. Influence of hydrogen as carrier gas The dehydrogenation activity of all zeolite supported, Pd containing catalysts starts to decrease after a few hours or days time on stream, depending upon support and metal loading. Surprisingly, a mean to avoid the deactivation is the addition of hydrogen to the carrier gas flow. Fig. 5 depicts the selectivity to p-cymene for ~- limonene conversion over catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-2 at 300 for a period of 550 h. Carrier gas composition was 30 vol% N2 and 70 vol% H2.

Weyrich, W.E HOlderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 was chosen since it has been shown before, that catalyst deactivation is slower at higher temperatures. Temperature 300 leads to complete destruction of the p- menthane carbon structure. The H2 to N2 ratio was random. The conversion of a-limonene was always at 100% over test period. The selectivity to p-cymene increased over the whole observed period of 550 h. The increase in selectivity to p-cymene from 20% to 77% after 550 h can again be attributed to the slow decrease of the formation of cracked products, indicating a much slower deactivation of the acid sites of the catalysts. Formation of C10H16 isomers (terpenes) was not observed over the whole period, indicating no loss of activity and accessibility of the Pd sites. Also coke precursors have not been formed even at the first hour of the reaction. Changing the H2 to N2 ratio towards higher amount of nitrogen causes a faster increase of the selectivity to p-cymene. The 100% conversion of ot-limonene leads to a faster increase of the yield (Fig. 5). 3.8.

Only a few Lewis-acid sites have been observed (1445 cm-~). With the incorporation of Ce into the zeolite (catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-3), Lewis acidity is strongly increased, as evidenced by the increase of the absorption band at around 1445 cm-1. Only a low Br~nsted acidity has been generated, as seen from the small absorption band at around 1545 cm-1. The presence of Br~nsted or Lewis acidity, however, can only be described qualitatively. Insertion of Pd (catalyst Na-ZSM-5-27-1) leads to the generation of BrCnsted sites, as evidenced to the rise of the absorption band at around 1545 cm-1. No change of Lewis acidity compared with the pure Na-ZSM-5-27-0 is observed upon Pd exchange. Ce and Pd exchanged catalysts exhibit both Lewis and BrCnsted acid sites. Comparison of Br~nsted absorption bands of Pd containing Na-ZSM-5-27-1 and Ce and Pd containing Na-ZSM-5-27-2 does not exhibit major differences in acid strength. However, it seems that Lewis acidity decreases, when Pd exchange is done on the catalyst initially exchanged with Ce (comparison of the catalysts Na-ZSM-5-27-2 and Na-ZSM-5-27-3). 4. Discussion The results of this study show that c~-limonene can be selectively transformed into p-cymene over ZSM-5 type zeolites. Skeletal isomerization to m- or o-cymene or p-n-propyltoluene is inhibited by steric constraints of the pentasil structure. Conversion over large pore Y-type zeolites yields large amount of m-cymene in addition to p-cymene, depending upon reaction temperature. At 300, initial m-/p-cymene ratio is 1.83, which almost reaches the thermodynamic equilibrium composition of 2.0. In contrary, although initial cracking of p-cymene to toluene and propene and propane is dominant over acidic H-ZSM-5 or Pd/H-ZSM-5, only traces of m-cymene are found in the product. One likely cause of this shape selectivity is product selectivity, a phenomenon that has been assumed to be valid in xylene isomerization by Csicsery and Wei [17]. Acidic H-ZSM-5 as well as catalysts based on Pd on acidic H-ZSM-5 support deactivates rapidly, presumably in the first minutes on stream. Several reasons can be responsible for the fast deactivation. Firstly, pore blockage due to low temperature coke is likely to narrow the pore openings so that ~-limonene is inhibited to enter the interior zeolite framework and the active Pd-sites. Never- theless, isomerization of ~-limonene to other CloH16 terpenes can still occur on acid sites of the outer zeolite surface. Secondly, the Pd-sites can be covered by a coke layer and thus hydrogen transfer decreases rapidly. Isomerization can then occur either on the internal or external surface. The catalyst containing Pd on almost no acidic Na-ZSM-5 as carrier shows the same behaviour, i.e. low hydrogen transfer activity and fast deactivation. One explanation for the similarity of Pd exchanged Na-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 can be the 160 P.A. Weyrich, W.E H61derich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 generation of BrCnsted sites due to ion-exchange procedure in the Na-ZSM-5 support. It is well known, that calcination and reduction of noble metal exchanged zeolites leads to acid sites [12,13]. Furthermore, an agglomeration of the Pd particles in the zeolite due to the calcination procedure or upon contact with the hydrocarbon feed can lead to a decrease in active sites and thus be responsible for the similar catalyst perfor- mance. The dispersion and agglomeration of noble metals in zeolites have been thoroughly investigated e.g. by W.M.H. Sachtler et al. [ 18]. The agglomeration of noble metals to clusters larger than the zeolite cavities has been observed. Addition of a Ce promoter prior to Pd insertion, enhances the catalyst stability for both highly acidic H-ZSM-5 and almost neutral Na-ZSM-5 support. However, the acid function of the support is still dominant and leads to a decrease in hydrogen transfer activity due to coke deposition for the H-ZSM-5 support within a couple of hours on stream. It is known from the automotive industry that Pd has an affinity to ceria particles. It can therefore be assumed that the presence of ceria enhances the Pd dispersion and thereby increases both the number of active sites available and the resistance for Pd agglomeration. Deactivation is slowed down to several hours with H-ZSM-5 as support and several days with Na-ZSM-5 as support, but still persists, indicating the presence of acid sites. Insertion of BrCnsted acidity is observed for (i) Pd exchanged and (ii) Pd exchanged zeolites initially promoted with Ce. Thus, deactivation due to coke formation on the acid sites can be concluded. It is known that Pd dispersion can be enhanced by careful calcination in oxygen and slow reduction of the noble metal exchanged zeolites. In particular, the Pd exchanged Na-ZSM-5 zeolite reacts very sensitive upon pretreatment conditions. Again, it is not possible to distinguish between higher Pd dispersion or a slight change in Br~nsted acidity or a combination of both being responsible for the enhanced dehydrogenation activity of carefully pretreated Pd exchanged Na-ZSM- 5 zeolites. The observed behaviour is by far less dominant for Ce promoted Pd/Na- ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts are basically unaffected by different pretreatment conditions on a high p-cymene selectivity level. This clearly indicates the strong interaction between Ce and Pd particles in the zeolite and suggests that Pd dispersion might be the important parameter for high dehydrogenation activity. One way of suppressing deactivation by coke deposition and Pd agglomeration is the addition of hydrogen to the carrier gas. However, adding hydrogen not only prevents Pd sites from deactivation, but also prevents the BrCnsted sites from fast deactivation by coke deposition. Thus, secondary reaction products from p-cymene formed on the BrCnsted sites, toluene and propane, decrease slowly in the product mixture. A way to reduce this pertinent cracking activity in the beginning of the reaction can be precoking of the catalyst. Depending upon reaction temperature and hydrogen addition, ot-limonene conversion reaches a quasi steady state at 100% and selectivities to p-cymene >80% after a few days time on stream. No deactivation of dehydrogenation activity was observed for the test period of 550 h. PA. Weyrich, W.E Hrlderich/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 145-162 161 The absence of any low temperature coke in the product distribution as well as the only slightly grey colour of the used catalyst after 4 weeks time-on-stream indicate, that coke formation is strongly inhibited by the addition of hydrogen. 5. Conclusions tx-Limonene can be easily dehydrogenated to p-cymene. However, the catalyst preparation and process conditions have to be adjusted carefully in order to avoid the secondary reactions and rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to coke deposition and presumably Pd agglomeration. Employing a medium-pore ZSM-5 zeolite as support for the Pd catalysts avoids skeletal isomerization of p-cymene to m- or o-cymene as observed for large pore zeolites used as carriers. Isomerization is made possible by the acid sites of a zeolite or by the hydro- genation/dehydrogenation mechanism at the Pd sites as well. Dehydrogenation to form the aromatic system is only obtained in the strong acid sites of H-ZSM-5. However, with Pd-Na-ZSM-5 with weak acidity the formation of the aromatic system is catalyzed by Pd. ACe promoter enhances the catalytic performance of the Pd catalysts, pre- sumably due to an anchoring effect towards the Pd particles. Selectivity to p- cymene is enhanced by employing an almost neutral Na-ZSM-5 as support and careful ion-exchange and activation procedures. The addition of hydrogen to the carrier gas diminish the deactivation. The yield of ct-limonene to p-cymene over a Ce and Pd exchanged Na-ZSM-5 catalyst was more than 80% and stable after a few days, and then no deactivation occurred throughout the tested period of 550 h.

        "dc:description": "The dehydrogenation of the natural terpene α-limonene to the industrially important p-cymene was studied over zeolite supported Pd catalysts. Transalkylation of the product p-cymene can be avoided by employing a medium-pore ZSM-5 catalyst via the well known product selectivity. The addition of a Ce promoter leads to an enhanced p-cymene selectivity and a slower catalyst deactivation. Surprisingly deactivation can be drastically reduced by the addition of hydrogen to the carrier gas.",
