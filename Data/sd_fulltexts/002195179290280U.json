ZHANG,*'l J. A. SCHWARZ,*'2 A. DATYE,'[\" AND J. P. BALTRUS~: *Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244; tDepartment of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131; and ~;United States Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15236 Received May 16, 1991; revised December 3, 1991 The differences in the amphoteric properties of WO3 and A1203 were exploited and cobalt precursors were selectively mounted on the tungsten oxide phase of a 12% WO3/AI203 composite. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPRd), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray pho- toelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and catalyst performance testing using H2/CO methanation as a test reaction revealed that this composite-supported catalyst's properties were significantly different from cobalt supported on alumina; Cobalt crystallites as well as a CoAI204 type of surface species are formed on the A1203 support. The presence ofWO3 as a second-phase oxide offers the possibility for a greater number of surface compounds to be formed on the composite. Specifically, cobalt-tung- sten interaction species are formed. We provide evidence that strongly suggests the active catalytic center in the conversion of I-I2 and CO to methane is a (cobalt-tungsten) interaction species. These active centers are present on Co/WO3, Co/12% WO3/AI203, and a commercial cobalt/tungsten oxide compound; A portion of the cobalt: in these active centers is not reduced to the metallic state. 1992 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION Tungsten oxide on an alumina carrier has been studied by a number of techniques. These include Raman spectroscopy (1, 2), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (2), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (2-4), UV-visible diffuse reflection spec- troscopy (5, 6), electron paramagnetic reso- nance spectroscopy (7), and: the properties of these composites when suspended in wa- ter (8). These studies had, as their primary goal, the elucidation of the structural state of the second-phase oxide. Recently, we re- ported on the effect of WO3 loading on the surface acidity of WO3/A1203 composite ox- ides (9). This study, as well as others from our laboratory, has had as a goal the charac- i Scientific Committee of Lanzhou, People's Repub- lic of China. 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed. 0021-9517/92 $3.00 Copyright 1992 by Academic Press, Inc.

Our reasons for this were based on developing a thorough under- standing of the surface charge development of these oxides when placed in electrolytes of varying pHs. The pH at which there is a change in the sign of the surface potential of an oxide is designated the point of zero charge (pzc). At this pH value, there will exist positive, negative, and neutral surface charge carri- ers; the sum of the first two will result in a net charge of zero. The pzcs of alumina and tungsten oxide are separated by -5 pH units (8). Composite oxides formed from these pure phases provide a model system for de- signing catalytic structures by varying the preparation procedures and then studying the performance of the resulting supported- metal catalysts. 200 EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 201 6 ~ o b ~5 I pH 12 FIG. 1. Schematic depicting the selective metal-sup- port exchange hypothesis. At pH = pH*, the A1203 phase has a positive charge and WO3 phase a negative charge. A pH-directed or selective metal-support exchange exploits the surface charge devel- opment on oxides during aqueous impregna- tion of catalytic precursors. While the ther- modynamic properties of these oxides have been reasonably well established, the cata- lytic properties of a second-phase oxide act- ing as an anchor for a catalytic metal have not. The fact that the pzcs of the pure phases are separated by -5 pH units provides a wide range for adjusting impregnating con- ditions during catalyst preparation. Figure 1 depicts the strategy of selective metal-sup- port exchange. The differences in the am- photeric behavior of the two components in a composite are exploited resulting in oppo- site charges on each component's surface. Careful adjustment of the impregnant pH (e.g., pH*) and choosing a suitable precur- sor, i.e., one whose speciation in the aque- ous phase is known, will result in a tungsten oxide phase that is a cation exchanger and an alumina phase that is an anion exchanger. The simplicity of this concept relies on two important conditions that must be met and must be determined experimentally. The first is that the pH-dependent surface charge development of each phase conforms to that of the pure compounds and they develop \"charge\" independent of the presence of their counterpart. The second is that adsorp- tion of the ionic solute is controlled by sur- face charge. The objective of this study is to test the selective metal-support exchange hypothe- sis and, if valid, to evaluate the catalytic performance of a metal mounted on a sec- ond-phase oxide. We chose cobalt nitrate as the catalytic precursor because its specia- tion in the aqueous phase has been reliably established (I0) and procedures for catalyst activation are available (11). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPRd) data of the dried precursors were obtained subsequent to catalyst impregna- tion. The calcined catalysts were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the catalysts, after reduction, were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS). Finally, the catalytic properties of the composite oxide-supported cobalt were determined in relation to that metal's properties when supported on each of the pure phases. Temperature-programmed re- action (TPRx) of CO, steady-state CO hy- drogenation, and the carbon inventory subsequent to reaction, as revealed by tem- perature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), were the methods employed. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS The alumina used in this work was de- rived from ground (40-80 mesh) M-in. extru- date, y phase, obtained from Americn Cy- anamid (Lot 85-NA-1402), having a BET surface area of 150 mZ/g and pore volume of 0.48 cc/g. It was treated at 875 K for 24 h before use. The tungsten oxide was 99.7% tungsten trioxide from Alfa, (Lot B021). Tungsten oxide is nonporous (average parti- cle size -0.04 mm) with a BET surface area of 1 mZ/g. The WO3 was calcined at 875 K for 24 h before use. The 12% WO3/A1203 composite was made by dry impregna- tion of ammonium metatungstate [(NH4)6HzWI2040 \" 5H20] obtained from GTE Sylvania. The composite oxide was dried at 380 K overnight and calcined at 875 202 ZHANG ET AL. K for 24 h. Its BET area was 131 m2/g. The point of zero charge of each support was determined by mass titration and the values for AI203, WO3, and 12% WO3/AI203 were 8.5, 4.08, and 6.08 (8). All samples were stored in a dry box purged with N2. During the course of this study, we found that having available characterization and performance data from a commercially pre- pared bulk cobalt-tungsten oxide sample would be useful for interpreting data ob- tained from the laboratory-prepared cata- lysts. Alfa products supplied a compound (Lot F10B) that they designated cobalt tung- state. X-ray analysis showed that this was not stoichiometric CoWO4; it was partially amorphous with some crystallinity. After calcination of 875 K for 6 h, X-ray analysis showed that the structure was reformed to CoWO4. The procedures for treatment and results obtained from study of this sample are presented later in the Experimental and then in the Results sections, and a discus- sion of the relationship of its properties to the dispersed catalysts is presented in the final section of this report. CATALYSTS The catalysts were prepared from a Co(NO3)2 6H20 precursor obtained from Fluka Chemicals (Lot 270876). Since equal weight loadings of Co on each support were required, preliminary experiments were conducted, and based on those results cata- lysts for characterization and performance evaluation were prepared. The preliminary experiments were performed at two levels. Equilibrium adsorption experiments using 2 g of each support and 25 cm3 of electrolyte (0.027 mol/liter) were conducted. The pH during preparation was maintained at 6. Fol- lowing these, dry impregnation and pseudo- wet impregnation methods were employed. The conditions for dry impregnation are given in Table 1A. The volume of water used for the WO3 support was scaled to the mass of WO3 used based on a water/mass ratio that we used in an earlier study (8). The conditions for pseudo-wet impregnation are given in Table 1B. Following their prepara- tion, the solids were filtered and then dried at 380 K for 24 h. The weight loadings on the dried catalysts prepared by both meth- ods were determined by extensive washings of cobalt from the support with 1 N HzSO4 at a temperature of 340 K followed by AA analysis. The Perkin-Elmer Model 2380 spectrophotometer was calibrated using Alfa products 88060AA standard solution (Lot 051183). Replicate runs demonstrated that our reproducibility was -+0.04 ppm. Ad- ditional samples with loadings of 1 and 3% by weight were prepared by the pseudo-wet impregnation method. The conditions are given in Tables 1C and 1D. Characterization and performance studies were conducted only on those samples prepared by the pseudo-wet impregnation method. CATALYST CHARACTERIZATION Apparatus and Procedures TPRd. The TPRd unit consisted of a gas handling system, a thermal conductivity cell and associated electronics (Fisher Model 1200 gas partitioner), linear temperature programmer (Omega Model CN-2011J), re- corder (IBM PC), sample holder, furnace, and cold traps. A complete description of the configuration can be found elsewhere (12). In these experiments, 100 mg of nonacti- vated and nonpassivated cobalt catalyst was dehydrated in a 100 cm3/min argon stream by heating from room temperature to 423 K at a heating rate of 5 K/min. The system was held at 423 K for 1 h and cooled to room temperature. After confirming that room- temperature reduction does not occur, the system was switched to an 8.7% H2 + Ar gas stream with a flow rate of 40 cm3/min and flushed for 15 min. The system was then heated from room temperature to 773 K at a heating rate of 20 K/rain. During the heating process, the hydrogen signal was monitored continuously. The supports themselves showed no H2 consumption during blank runs.

Calcined catalyst samples (875 K for 24 h) were examined in a JEOL 2000 FX TEM at 200 keV. The TEM results we report are for those of the \"oxidized\" catalyst, not the reduced catalyst, so we are not seeing cobalt metal but cobalt oxide. The powders were dusted onto holey carbon film sup- ported on copper grids. Elemental analysis was performed using a Tracor Northern en- ergy dispersive spectroscopy system (EDS) equipped with a Be window X-ray detector. Quantitative analysis was performed using the standardless analysis program SMTF. XPS. The XPS measurements were per- formed with a Leybold-Hereaus LHS-10 in- strument equipped with a DS5 data acquisi- tion system. This instrument has an auxiliary sampling port with an associated microreaction chamber (approx 30 cm3) that allows samples to be treated at or above atmospheric pressure. This spectrometer uses a magnesium anode (Mg Kc~ = 1253.6 eV) operated at 13 kV and 20 mA. The in- strument operates at a vacuum of 2 x 10-9 mbar (2 x 10-7 Pa) or lower. The detection area on the sample was approximately 3 x 7 mm. A thin l-cm-diameter precalcined catalyst wafer, formed from the powdered catalysts after calcination at 875 for 24 h, was sand- wiched between tantalum foils and attached to a Leybold-Hereaus heatable transfer rod. After insertion of the transfer rod into the reactor zone, a 5-min evacuation of the reactor was performed followed by the re- duction treatment. The reduction was per- formed in a hydrogen flow with a flow rate of 10 cm3/min. The temperature was pro- grammed to ramp with a heating rate of 10 K/min to 673 K and held at 673 K for 16 h. The catalyst was then cooled in the hydro- gen flow to room temperature. After com- pletion of these treatments, the catalyst was transferred to the XPS analysis position via vacuum interlocks. This transfer was nor- mally accomplished within 5 min. The re- duced catalysts were also sputtered with Ar+ for 10 min and reanalyzed. It was esti- mated that approximately 50 A was re- moved from the surface based on sputtering 204 ZHANG ET AL. thin-film reference samples of similar com- position under the same conditions. The Co 2p3/2 transition was used to iden- tify the cobalt species on the catalyst sur- face. For y-alumina-supported catalysts, the A1 2p line from the alumina support was used as the binding energy reference (74.5 eV) for correction due to sample charging. For samples not containing A1203 the C ls peak (284.6 eV) due to hydrocarbon contam- ination was used as a binding energy refer- ence. The binding energies reported were found to be reproducible to -+0.2 eV. The Co 2P3/2 spectra were curve fitted using a damped nonlinear least-squares fitting pro- gram. The entire Co 2p region was not fitted because of the very poor signal/noise in the 2pj/2 region. This may lead to a small under- reporting of the oxide contribution to the Co spectra, but this error is not believed to significantly alter the interpretation of the data. The curve-fitting results were used to calculate the particle-size-corrected extents of Co reduction and average Co particle sizes according to previously published methods (13, 14). Catalyst Performance TPD unit. Experiments of TPRx of CO, methanation, and TPSR were performed in the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) unit. This apparatus is composed of a temperature programmer, mass flow con- trollers, a tubular reactor, a mass analyzer, and an IBM PC for data retrieval. The reac- tor temperature was programmed and con- trolled by a temperature programmer. The product gas is analyzed by the mass ana- lyzer and recorded by the IBM PC. Details of this apparatus are described elsewhere (15). TPRx. Before TPRx, the dried catalysts were reduced according to the following schedule: 100-mg samples were heated in 50 cm3/min H2 flow from room temperature to 423 K at a rate of 5 K/min, held there for 1 h, heated further to 473 K, held for an additional 1 h, and finally treated at 673 K in pure H2 for 40 h. Following cooling to room temperature in a 30 cm3/min helium stream, a number of CO (0.25 cm3/pulse) pulses were injected to saturate the catalyst surface. The CO gas was preheated and kept at low pressure to prevent the formation of carbonyls. After the pulsing sequence, the system was flushed by a 30 cm3/min helium stream for 10 rain. The system was heated from room temperature to 873 K in a 30 cm3/ rain hydrogen stream at a heating rate of 20 K/min. Peaks ofm/e = 2, 15, 28, 30, and 44 were monitored during the heating process. The reactor was held at 873 K for 1 h (to remove the carbon residue from the catalyst surface), flushed with a 30 cm3/min helium stream for I0 min, and cooled to room tem- perature. A second temperature program was performed, and no signals were de- tected. Methanation. These experiments were performed over a temperature range be- tween 503 and 543 K. A H2/CO = 3/1 gas mixture was used as the reactant at a flow rate of 30 cm3/min. The reduced catalyst was heated to 503 K and the temperature was then increased in steps. After each tempera- ture step, the system was held for 10 min to reach a steady reaction rate. Peaks of m~ e = 2, 15, 28, 30, and 44 were monitored continuously. Additional experiments were performed in which higher temperatures in the range studied were selected first to en- sure that data collected at higher tempera- tures were not influenced by structural changes that may have occurred at lower reaction temperatures. The Arrhenius plots were reversible, an indication that no such structural modifications occurred. The max- imum conversion did not exceed 7% for the most active catalyst. After the reaction se- quence described above was performed, the system was flushed with a 30 cm3/min he- lium stream for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. Blank runs over each support showed no activity over the temperature range 500-600 K. The commercial cobalt tungstate was tested before reduction and after reduction. In the former case, 0.03 g of sample was EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 205 it I1 I I I I i I b OE': J, J' i, I ~, 0 20 40 60 Time/rain FIG. 2.

The sample was reduced in H2 (50 cm3/min) at 675 K for 20 h following the dehydration procedures described above. Both samples were subjected to methanation studies using procedures identical to those used for the dispersed catalysts. RESULTS CATALYST PREPARATION To test our hypothesis, catalysts of equiv- alent weight loadings had to be prepared on AI203, 12% WO3/A1203, and WO3 using similar procedures. Additional constraints were imposed. The pH of the impregnant needed to lie in the window of the pH of the pzcs of the pure supports in order to realize the pH-directed adsorption of the Co2pre- cursor. Also, the weight loading of the fi~- ished catalysts should be in excess, of ~5:% to ensure sufficient reduction ~ modes.~ tem~ peratures (<775 K) so that en-ougl~, m~.~ ~s, present to detect reaction pro~uG si~,. Preliminary experiments were eorvd~red! to establish the appropriate experi,mer~dt conditions. Cobalt solutions with a~ tration sufficient to mount 3% by wei~ of metal, assuming all the Co was transferred! to the support, were prepared. Figure 2 shows the amount adsorbed as a function of time for these preliminary experiments. It is seen that adsorption equilibrium is attained in -10 rain. The amount adsorbed on AI203 is much greater than that on 12% WO3/ A1203; under these conditions virtually no adsorption occurs on WO3. The weight load- ing on A1203 that corresponds to the plateau shown in Fig. 2 is -0.02%, clearly demon- strating that the adsorption/exchange com- ponent of Co derived from wet impregnation is very small. The rationale behind the pseudo-wet im- pregnation experiments was based on the assumption that the amount of Co adsorbed by exchange could be neglected compared to the amount deposited during the evapora- tion of electrolyte from within the pores. An excess of solution was used in the latter case to provide for a more homogeneous deposition of precursor that might better ap- proximate the processes occurring during ion exchange (15). The metal content of each catalyst was determined by AA and results are presented in Table 2. The results show that similar weight loadings are ob- tained on all supports regardless of the method. TPRd Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the TPRd profiles for the dried cobalt catalysts with weight loadings of 1, 3, and 6% mounted on each support.

Co/WO3: profiles with a peak temperature maximum that increases to higher tempera- tures as the loadings increase are observed. The analysis of TPRd profiles for multicom- ponent systems usually treats the problem of resolving interactions between two met- als on a common support. In this case, TPRd profiles for the bimetal system are either the simple superposition of features seen for each metal on the same support or new features in the profile that might be attrib- uted to, for example, a metal-metal interac- tion during reduction are seen. The analysis of the data presented in Fig. 3-5 is complicated by several factors. First, the dispersed WO3 does not have to have the same properties as its bulk counterpart; metal-support interactions revealed during TPRd might, therefore, have no \"pure phase\" analogue for comparison. Second, the \"efficiency\" of selective metal deposi- EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 207 0O08 0.006 .Q 0004 =? o.oo2 ' I ~ I ' i l 0 -0(301 420 I L I ~ I , 46O 500 54O 58O Temperoture, K 0014 O.Ol~ ~ 0.00~ - 8 ~ - ~ o.oo4 0 420 460 ,500 540 Temperature, K ' I , I 58O O.02e ' I ' I ' -- (e) 0.02 g ~ 0.012 g :ff 0.004 0 -- -0002 ~ I , I , I 420 ~ 500 540 Teml~roture,K ---______ I 58O I __ I i , 006 -- =~ - 004 g o.o2 u 0 - 0.01 [ , 1 , I 420 46(3 500 540 Temperoture, K I L i 580 FIG. 4.

Other factors, such as direct exchange with A1203 hydroxyl groups, could occur. Thus, the weight loading associated with each phase is unknown, and the results shown in Figs. 3 and 5 demonsrate that peak positions vary depending on loading and pure support. Fi- nally, the results shown in Fig. 2 confirm that adsorption/impregnation of Co2+ on Al203 and the WO3-modified carrier is not very favorable. Only 0.02% by weight is ex- changed with AI203 and approximately one- third of this value is found on the 12% WO3/ AI203 composite. The TPRd experiments were performed on samples where weight loadings were orders of magnitude greater than those where adsorption results are available. We have no data on the adsorp- tion properties onto these supports under pseudo-wet impregnation conditions. Col- lectively, such factors make it difficult to quantitatively evaluate the TPRd profiles of the composites. We have attempted to quali- tatively interpret the composite profiles. The motivation was to provide reasonable confirmation that a fraction of the cobalt is associated with the second phase oxide (WO3) despite the fact that only 12% by weight of the samples is WO3 and the esti- 0.008 I j , 0.006 == E 0.004 o m 8 u 0002 208 ZHANG ET AL. - ' /-''1 ....

The TPRd profiles for Co on the pure ox- ides were assumed to be Gaussian. The Lev- enberg-Marquardt method, which reduces the least-squares difference between the ex- perimental profile of the composite and that of two Gaussian profiles, was employed (18). In this method, no assumption regard- ing the parameters of the Gaussian profiles (peak amplitude, position, and FWHM)are made. First, we examined the TPRd profiles from A1203 assuming that two Gaussian pro- files could fit the data. Indeed, good fits could be obtained. However, the contribu- tion from the \"lower\" temperature peak (most evident in Figs. 3b and 3c) was always less than 16% of the total area. Thus, we treated the A1203 contribution to the com- posite TPRd profiles (at each weight load- ing) as a simple Gaussian. The calculation was then reinitiated by selecting six parame- ters (3 for each Gaussian profile derived from the pure supports) and regression was then used to provide the best fit parameters. Figure 6, 7, and 8 show the experimental and calculated TRPd profiles for the composites with Co weight loadings of 1, 3, and 6%.

This occurs despite the fact that only 12% by weight of the samples is WO3 and the estimated sur- face area of WO3 is only - 15 m2/g (8). The variation in peak temperature maxima from sample to sample are in reasonable agreement with those from the pure sup- ports but they show no discernible trend, which might be a reflection of the fact that the properties of WO3 and AI203 in the com- posite are different from their bulk-phase counterparts.

The sample showed particles of a Co-containing phase that generally ex- ists independent of WO3. In fact, some re- gions showed single crystals of a Co-con- taining phase ranging in size from 30 to 40 nm. Diffraction experiments conclusively identified Co304 as the cobalt phase. 210 ZHANG ET AL.

Figure 9 shows that, on A1203, Co particles are poorly dispersed with particle size in the range of 16-30 nm (average 19 rim). The Co particle size is very nonuniform; diffraction experiments confirmed that cobalt exists as C0304. EDS spectra were measured from small, thin particles of support where the absence of Co304 particles could be checked visually. Of six areas examined, two showed no Co peak at all and the others ranged from 0.84 to 1.19%. When Co304 particles were obviously present, the analysis indicated 4 and 4.6% Co. These numbers are not pre- cise because a standardless analysis was used, but the trend indicates that even when Co particles are not seen, some Co is present. 6% Co/12% WO3/AI203. On the composite the particle sizes range from 60 to 80 nm (average 76 nm) indicating a poorer disper- sion, but the relative standard deviation in- dicates that the Co crystallite size distribu- tion is approximately twice as uniform when compared to A1203 (see Fig. I0). This could be interpreted on the following basis. Some of the Co(NO3)2 may interact with the WO3 to form a Co2+-WO3 species, while the re- maining Co(NO3)2 agglomerates to form large particles. It is possible that the pzc of the WO3-modified carrier (more acidic) is responsible for the formation of large Co(NO3)2 particles, which become large Co~O4 crystallites following calcination. The uniformity of the particle size distribu- tion may simply be due to the fact that ex- tremely large Co304 particles are formed. On the composite sample, areas that had obvious particles of Co304 showed Co at a level of -4%. The thin areas had analyses as follows: 0.9, 1.2, 0.5, 1.2, 1.8, and 0.9, suggesting again that there is dispersed Co in addition to the large particles. These areas also showed W to be present. This strongly suggests that the dispersed second-phase oxide (WO3) serves as nucleation centers for a better dispersed Co phase. XPS Co304. The cobalt oxide standard showed the Co 2p3/2 peak indicative of the oxide at 780.5 eV. After reduction, this downshifts to 778.2 eV indicative of metallic cobalt. COW04. We find that Co is totally reduced to metallic Co and tungsten is partially re- duced to metallic W. The spectra are much less complicated than the oxide-supported spectra in that we do not observe the differ- ential charging that produced two sets of peaks for each of the reduced species as described below. Co~W03. Comparing the XPS spectra of the catalyst with that ofCo304 indicates that the Co is in the form of Co304. It is totally reducible to metal. There is an increase in the Co 2p/W 4f intensity ratio when the catalyst is reduced. Co/Al203 (Fig. 11). The calcined catalyst EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 211 FIG. 9.

When the catalyst is reduced, Co304 is converted to Co metal; however, there remains a nonreducible Coox with higher binding energy and a prominent shake-up satellite peak, likely due to COA1204 (17). The difference in binding en- ergy for metallic Co in the supported cata- lysts compared to reduced Co304 or Co/ WO3 may be due to differential charging be- tween Coo and the A1203 support, which was used as a reference (A1 2p = 74.5 eV). An unusual phenomenon is observed in the Co 2p spectra of the reduced catalyst shown in Fig. 11 that has sometimes been observed previously in our laboratory during the re- duction of Co/A1203 catalysts. A peak ap- pears at approximately 3.4 eV lower than the 777.4-eV peak assigned to Co This is due to Coo that is in electrical contact with the sample holder and does not charge. When the catalyst is sputtered, some of the electrical contact is broken, and the major metallic Co peak is at 777.7 eV. The CoAI 2p intensity ratio is observed to increase on sputtering, in contrast to an observed decrease in the COoA1 2p intensity ratio. Co/12% WO3/AI203 (Fig. 12) The com- posite-supported Co catalyst is unlike that of either its AI203 or its WO3 counterparts. An observed higher binding energy for Co and the presence of a prominent shake-up peak characteristic of Co2+ indicates that 212 ZHANG ET AL. FIG. 10. TEM micrograph of 6% Co on 12% WO3/AI203. a relatively larger area is occupied by this species on the surface of the composite cata- lyst than that of Co/A1203. The reducibility of Co in this catalyst is the lowest, but calcu- lations show the metallic Co crystallite size to be only slightly greater in the composite catalyst compared to Co/A1203 following re- duction. Tungsten is nonreducible in all of the catalysts. The spectra do change signifi- cantly because of both increases in W inten- sity in some cases and also a decrease in surface charging on reduction and a further decrease in charging after sputtering. This is evidenced by increased resolution of the W 4fdoublet and a simultaneous decrease in FWHM of the AI 2p peak for the composite- supported catalyst (2). A summary of the Co 2p3/2 binding ener- gies for the cobalt oxide and metallic phases and average Coo crystallite sizes calculated from the XPS results are presented in Tables 4A, 4B, and Table 5.

These results, which are the averaged values from three analyses, are compiled in Table 5. The cobalt/aluminum ratio decreases for both the AI203 and composite-supported Co cata- lysts after reduction. CATALYST PERFORMANCE The CO TPRx spectra for each catalyst are shown in Fig. 13. By 600 K, virtually all the adsorbed CO is removed as CH4 (small amounts of CO2 were detected) over the Al203 and composite oxide-supported Co catalysts. However, for Co/WO3, there al- ways appeared a high-temperature tailing despite the fact that a discernible and repro- ducible peak appears at ~435 K. Since these spectra are used to estimate the number of active sites, some explanation for the behav- ior seen in Fig. 13c was sought. We show elsewhere that TPRd profiles for bulk WO3 and weight loadings from 30 to 2% WO3/ AI203 show a progressively higher onset of reduction temperature (18). The catalysts used in this study were reduced in pure H2 at 673 for 40 h, while the TPRd results are obtained for 8 HJAr. The actual onset of reduction in the case that pure H2 is used is not known; however, it is likely that the order of reducibility should proceed: WO3 (bulk) easier than WO3 (supported). Such a conclusion is consistent with results re- ported by Kadkhodayan and Brenner (19). c t_ tl >- I-- z itl I- c\"31, :: , .f \", \" ~.~ \"*\" t, b~ I 790.0 785.0 \\ ~- d:ll> '78O.O 775,O ' BINDING ENERGY, eV FIG. 12.

In a separate set of experiments, a WO3 support was subjected to a TPRx experi- ment following our standard procedures. The results showed that CH4 was evolved at temperatures higher than -550 K. Thus, we attribute the area labeled II in Fig. 13c to CO hydrogenation on a reduced portion of WO3. It is important to note that any contribution to CH4 formation from WO3 alone under the steady-state conditions of our experiments will be negligible because the highest reaction temperature was less than 550 K and bulk WO3 has a very low activity at this temperature and dispersed TABLE 5 XPS Data for Treated Co Catalysts Sample Treat Ico zps~E/IAJ 2p /co 2p3,2/ lw lw 4f/lAx 2p CoO size condition 4y (nm) Co/AI203 a 0.32 b 0.12, metal 14.6 0.17, oxide c 7.7 0.24, metal 0.07, oxide Co/WOJA12Os a 0.58 0.70 b 0.07, metal 1.23 0.41, oxide c 0.16, metal 1.59 0.28, oxide Co/W03 a 1.85 b 3.67 c 3.04 20.3 9.7 Note.

WO3 is not reduced at this temperature. The apparent absence of any reduced tungsten in our XPS results is probably due to the shorter treatment time (cf. 40 h vs 16 h) in hydrogen. The bulk CoWO4 sample showed a very interesting activity pattern. In its dehy- drated (nonreduced) state, it exhibited a high reactivity, comparable to that of Co/ WO3. For example, at 535 K the activity for the CoWQ (nonreduced) and Co/WO3 (reduced) were 460 and 470/xmol CH4/g min, respectively.3 The activity at each tem- perature reached a steady value, showing little to no deactivation; its reactivity was reversible when the temperature was either 3 The densities of these materials are approximately the same, which provides resonable justification for comparing activities on a weight basis. increased or decreased. On the other hand, a stable reactivity measurement for the re- duced CoWO4 sample could not be ob- tained. At the lowest reaction temperature (-500 K) its activity was high but showed a sharp decrease with increasing time on stream (-10 min). When the temperature was raised, the same behavior was ob- served. These results suggest that: (1) on the surface of this commercial sample, there are Co-W species that are active in methana- tion, (2) the nonreduced sample is not re- duced under reaction conditions or other- wise its behavior would have been similar to the reduced sample. We return to this point shortly. A qualitative scenario emerges. The com- posite oxide has the lowest temperature TPRx peak maximum and no adsorbed CO remains on the composite catalyst at tern- 216 ZHANG ET AL. -6 -7 -8 E E -10 -II I I -- 0 Ce/WOs I I 1 I I I -~2 I I I I I I I I I 1.75 1.79 1.85 1.87 191 1.9,5 IO00/K FIG. 14.

This peak maximum temperature is followed by the WO3 and then the A1203- supported cobalt. Based on previous obser- vations (20), we would expect that the meth- anation activity per gram of catalyst would be highest over the composite followed by the WO3 and then the Al203-supported co- balt. Indeed, this is what is found. Figure 14 shows Arrhenius plots of the methanation rate based on 1 g of catalyst. We present the data in this form because we still need to establish a basis for evaluating the number of active sites, which we do shortly. The solid lines are least-squares fits to the data.

The intrinsic activity of Co is the same for those catalysts that contain WO3, whether WO3 is present in the form of dispersed clusters anchored on AI203 or on bulk particles acting as the catalyst carrier. We had difficulty estimating the number of active sites on CoWO4; therefore, no TON is reported for this sample. All catalysts pro- duced some ethane with an activity varia- TABLE 7 Activity of Supported Co Catalysts Temperature (K) TON Co/A1203 540 0.014 Co/WOa/AI203 540 0.27 Co/WO3 536 0.26 EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 217 tion, per gram of catalyst, in the same order as their methane formation rate; however, the values were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the methane values. The TPSR spectra subsequent to steady- state methanation reveals the carbon inven- tory that develops on the catalyst surface during reaction. A part of this inventory could be either undissociated CO or various forms of CHx (x = 0-3). The former would be removed from the surface as CH4 ap- pearing over a temperature range corre- sponding to that of a CO-TPRx experiment; the latter would be evolved as CH4 in tem- perature ranges corresponding to the reac- tivity of the CH~ residue. We find that above 600 K, methane is removed from the surface of each catalyst in a complex fashion as indi- cated by many peaks in the spectra. The CHx pool is assumed to be the source of this CH4. The maximum amount comes from the composite catalyst. Below 550 K, the maxi- mum reaction temperature, there is virtually no methane released from the composite and the WO3-supported catalysts. This sug- gests that all carbon-containing species are rapidly removed under reaction conditions, prior to TPSR. However, the AlzO3-sup- ported catalyst releases methane in a peak whose shape and position are identical to that found for its CO-TPRx experiment. This is shown in Fig. 13a. The area under this peak in the TPSR spectrum is approxi- mately twice the area under the CO-TPRx spectrum. The higher capacity for carbon retention in the form of CO for this catalyst could be due to the fact that more CO is adsorbed when exposed to the catalyst sur- face in the presence of H2 under reaction conditions when compared to He under TPRx conditions (21). Collectively, these results demonstrate that CO dissociation on cobalt for the composite and for WO3 sup- ports is much easier than that for Co sup- ported on AI203. The differences in CO acti- vation seen in these catalysts are likely due to the chemical/structural nature of the ac- tive site(s). DISCUSSION At the outset, we reiterate the two objec- tives of this study. We sought to demon- strate that a pH-directed selective metal- support exchange could be realized when catalyst preparation conditions were care- fully considered. A number of recent studies have attempted to establish the mecha- nism(s) for CO adsorption and hydrogena- tion that operates on alumina-supported catalytic metals (22). These studies em- ployed various sequences of reactant ad- sorption followed by different schedules of temperature-programmed desorption while monitoring the release of methane. Lee and Bartholomew (21) have provided a scenario for the reactive pathways similar to that pro- posed by Falconer and co-workers (22): (1) CO dissociation on the metal followed by hydrogenation of carbon; (2) spillover of CO and H to the support where a CHxO complex is formed followed by diffusion of the com- plex to metal crystallites where it decom- poses. Both reactions take place on metal sites. Our experiments were conducted on co- balt catalysts using a single heating rate and a single set of TPRx conditions. Our second objective is to establish the properties of a catalytic metal, such as cobalt, when it is dispersed on a second-phase oxide, not to establish mechanistic pathways. However, our results are completely consistent with previous results. We find two methane peaks in the TPRx spectra from the alumina and composite oxide supported catalysts. The origin of the peaks has been the basis for interpreting mechanistic pathways. Ex- amination of Fig. 13 shows that there are significant downshifts in the peak tempera- ture maxima for the two CH4 peaks from the composite compared to the alumina-sup- ported catalyst. This finding implies that the rate-limiting steps of all reactive pathways are altered, and this we attribute to the ac- tive centers that result when cobalt is sup- ported on the second-phase oxide. The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide on cobalt catalysts has been known to be 218 ZHANG ET AL. affected by two factors: the cobalt loading (or particle size) (23, 24) and the extent of reduction (25, 26). These two factors are dependent on each other in that the extent of reduction is determined by, among other things, the cobalt weight loading. Recently, Lee et al. (27) reported that from their TEM results the particle sizes varied only slightly with reduction conditions and that the aver- age particle size was about 20 nm at a con- stant cobalt loading of -10% by weight, The structure-sensitive nature of CO hy- drogenation on supported cobalt catalysts has been interpreted by the following rea- soning. As dispersion increases, the relative concentrations of the surface sites with lower coordination (e.g., planar sites) de- creases and this results in a catalyst whose CO dissociation properties are poor. Kell- ner and Bell (28) and Mieth and Schwarz (20) attributed the higher activity of more poorly dispersed catalysts to electronic ef- fects related to enhancement in the 7r back- bonding contribution into the CO antibond- ing 27r* orbital resulting in a weakening of the C-O bond. Based on the above observations, we must first examine whether particle size dif- ferences can be the source of the enhanced activity of cobalt supported on the compos- ite oxide compared to cobalt supported on A1203. A detailed study of particle size ef- fects on the composite support is not avail- able; thus our conclusions must be inferred from Co/AI203 results where data are avail- able. Our TEM results show that the aver- age particle sizes for the calcined catalysts are 17.8 nm for Co/A1203 and 77 nm for Co/12% WOa/A1203. Experimentally, we are unable to perform in situ reduction in the TEM, so particle sizes in the reduced state of the catalyst must be estimated. This esti- mate was performed at two levels for the Co/AlzO3 catalyst. Reuel and Bartholo- mew (23) report the extent of reduction as a function of Co weight loading. We interpo- late their data to the 6% weight loading of our catalyst and use the CO-TPRx data to estimate the particle size on the reduced Co/ AI203 catalyst. The value we calculate is 22 nm in excellent agreement with the conclu- sions reached by Lee et al. (27) cited earlier. We must be careful in using TPRx data for such estimates because the controversy re- lates to the origin of the two peaks in the spectrum. Using the XPS data and pre- viously published methods (13, 14), we ar- rive at a particle size of 14.6 nm, which is also in reasonable agreement with the value determined above. We still do not know the particle size of Co on the composite oxide. However, based on the reasonable agreement observed for Co/A1203, the Coo particle size may be esti- mated using the XPS results (13, 14) and the CO-TPRx data. The former calculation yields a particle size for the reduced cata- lyst of 20 nm and for the latter a value of 22.4 nm. The estimated values of particle sizes for CoO on AI203 and the composite appear to be internally consistent whether XPS data alone or XPS/TPRx data are used as a basis for the calculations. Due to the similarity in computed/estimated particle sizes, struc- tural sensitivity in its usual context appears to be inconsistent with explaining the 20- fold enhancement in TON seen for the com- posite oxide-supported cobalt catalyst com- pared to Co/A1203. This higher intrinsic ac- tivity seen for the tungsten-containing catalysts must be related to their ability to activate CO bond breaking, which would be followed by a rapid reaction of surface hydrogen with nascent carbon. While this \"fact\" appears to be evident, a more de- tailed understanding is not directly apparent from the data available. However, we can speculate as to the origin of the enhance- ment in activity seen, and this we do below. The introduction of W onto the AI203 sup- port results in a redistribution of Co phases compared to Co/AI203. Initially, the higher Co 2p3/2 intensity ratio for the unreduced composite catalyst compared to Co/AI203 might lead one to conclude that Co is better dispersed on the composite catalyst. How- ever, upon closer examination of the trends EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 219 in Co/A1 intensity ratios for the metal and oxidic phases of the reduced catalyst sys- tems in Table 5, one can observe distinctly different trends in Co particle size for these phases caused by the prior deposition of W. The formation of an unreducible oxide phase in the composite catalyst appears to be greater than that of Co/AI203. Indeed, the proportion of Co2 + observed in the XPS spectra of the as-prepared catalyst (indi- cated by a more pronounced satellite peak to the higher binding energy site of the main Co 2p3/z peak) is greater than that of Co/ A1203, accompanying the observed de- crease in reducibility of the composite cata- lyst compared to Co/AI203. Combined, these observations may initially lead one to conclude that there is a greater proportion of the nonreducible CoAl204-1ike species formed on the surface of the composite cata- lyst. However, the activity data are not con- sistent with an increase in formation of a Co2+-W interaction species. A CoZ+-W in- teraction species, like CoAI204, would be well dispersed and contribute to the higher CooxidJAl intensity ratio for the reduced composite catalyst compared to Co/A1203. To examine the possibility that some type of Co-W interaction species may have been formed, activity measurements were con- ducted on CoWO4, and it was found that the unreduced sample had an activity that was comparable to Co/WO3. XPS reduction studies of CoWO4 were also conducted un- der the same conditions used for reducing the composite catalyst. First, prior to reduc- tion, the characteristic satellite due to Co2+ was very pronounced in the Co 2p3/2 spec- trum and the binding energy of the Co (781.9) was nearly identical to that observed for the composite catalyst. However, it was also discovered that Co in CoWO4 was to- tally reducible to metallic Co, and W was partially reducible to metallic W. Formation of CoWO4 in the composite catalyst would then contradict the decrease in reducibility of Co observed for this cata- lyst. Nevertheless, this apparent contradic- tion may not preclude the formation of a Co-W interaction species on the A1203 sup- port. Salvati et al. (2) observed that when tungsten is distributed at less than mono- layer coverage on AlzO3, it is nonreducible. On the composite catalyst at less than a monolayer coverage of W, it is unreducible, and this may in turn hinder reduction of Co that is in contact with the tungsten phase. At the same time, Co in interaction with W would yield XPS spectra more compatible with CoWO4 than Co304 prior to reduction. Although the Co-W interaction species may be inert toward reduction, it may exhibit higher activity, as observed for CoWQ. The metallic Co particle size, based on XPS results alone, appears greater in the reduced composite catalyst than in reduced Co/A1203. Although the Co/A1 intensity ra- tio would be expected to be less in the com- posite catalyst due to less formation of re- duced Co, the decrease in intensity ratio compared to reduced Co/AI203 cannot be explained by this phenomenon alone. A greater particle size for Co in the composite catalyst is consistent with a larger Co304 particle size observed in the composite cata- lyst than in Co/AI203 by TEM for the oxide catalyst. When either the reduced compos- ite catalyst or the reduced Co/A1203 are sputtered, the oxide component decreases as expected since it is initially well dispersed and more amenable to sputter removal. In contrast, the Co component on the surface of each catalyst increases on sputtering and decreases in average particle size. Such be- havior may be due to exposure of more finely divided metallic Co beneath the sur- face of the catalyst and destruction by the sputtering process of the large metallic Co particles initially formed on reduction. We rule out the possibility that the 76-nm parti- cles on the oxidized composite catalysts spread out over the WO3 surface to form smaller particles after the reduction. A brief explanation for the apparent de- crease in Co particle size upon reduction of the composite catalyst is in order. Since XPS calculations result in an average parti- cle size estimate, XPS cannot determine the 220 ZHANG ET AL. fraction of Co metal present as large parti- cles versus small. One possible explanation for the difference in Co metal particle size expected from TEM results for the oxidic composite catalyst and XPS data for the re- duced composite catalyst involves the re- ducibility of the Co2 +-W phase. Results for the CoWO4 sample showed that Co is com- pletely reduced to Co metal. While it is not known whether the supported Co2W phase is reducible, the discrepancy in parti- cle size for the oxidic (76 nm) and reduced (20 nm) cobalt particles suggests that the average Co metal particle size is due to a reduction of large (76 nm) Co304 crystallites and part of the highly dispersed Co2+-W surface phase. Thus, the reduced composite catalyst may contain large Co metal crys- tallites from reduction of the 76-nm Co304 particles, small Co metal particles from a reduction of a fraction of the Co2+-W sur- face phase, unreduced Co2+-W surface phase, and unreduced CoA12Q-like species. It is tempting to attribute the higher activ- ity of the composite to the presence of CoA1204-1ike species, which could promote CO dissociation in the same manner that NiA12Oa-like species were found to do in earlier studies (15). However, the intrinsic activity of Co/WO3 was identical to the Co/ composite catalyst and the activity of unre- duced CoWO4 was comparable to that of Co/WO3, which makes any explanation based on CoA1204-1ike species causing en- hanced activity unlikely. Finally, we are left with the possibility of formation of a Co2+-W species, the presence of which would be consistent with our arguments pre- sented above. To examine this possibility further, we first discuss effects that occur during the initial preparation of the cata- lysts. The equilibrium adsorption results on each support (Fig. 2) show that only a small amount of Co2ions is transferred to the solid phase. In the case of A1203 this is ex- pected; the experiment was conducted at a pH -6, which is below its point of zero charge. The net charge on the surface is positive, and the existence of any adsorp- tion suggests that direct exchange with sur- face hydroxyls is the mechanism for ad- sorption. Such a process is generally unfa- vorable. On the other hand, we see virtually no adsorption on WO3. This experiment was conducted at a pH -6, which is above the pzc of WO3 (~4 (8)) so that the net charge on its surface is negative. However, the very low surface area of WO3 (-1 m2/g (8)) re- sults in negligible adsorption of Co2+ on WO3. The composite oxide shows what ap- pears to be an intermediate behavior as far as its adsorption uptake is concerned. This result could be due to several factors. The pzc of this composite is -6 (8), which would suggest that Co2+ ions in the bulk solution at pH -6 would experience only a small, if any, driving force for interaction with the surface. On the other hand, when 12% WO3 is mounted on AI203, the meta- tungstate anion experiences favorable con- ditions (low pH) for adsorption onto the pos- itive AI203 surface. Approximately 1020 WO3 species per gram of A1203 are added at the sacrifice of AI203 hydroxyl sites. Thus, the amount of adsorption/exchange origi- nally occurring on A1203 will likely be de- creased. Consequently, although the addi- tion of a favorable adsorption phase (WO3) would suggest an increase in the adsorption of Co2 + onto the composite, we in fact see a decrease. To quantify this hypothesis would require a detailed model for adsorption on composite oxides that included not only sur- face charge effects but also the number of protonated/deprotonated sites available, as well as the pH-dependent concentration of charged and neutral sites. This is beyond the scope of the present work. Our modeling of the charge development on composite oxides (8) is based on simple additive contribution of each phase (based on surface area) to the measured pzc. Based on this, the WO3 phase would be \"negative\" (pH preparation > pzc WO3) and adsorption should be favorable on this phase. How- ever, the estimated surface area of the sec- ond phase is -15 m2/g (8), which would EFFECT OF SECOND-PHASE OXIDES ON DISPERSED METALS 221 suggest that the measured adsorbed amount should be greater than bulk WO3 but less than A1203 (surface area -150 m2/g). The TPRd results and the results of adsorption from the impregnation solutions cited above suggest that a substantial amount of Co is associated with the dispersed tungsten phase (see, e.g., Table 3). When this work was initiated, our inter- ests were motivated by demonstrating the selective metal-support exchange concept and its potential effects on the catalytic properties of a metal mounted on a dis- persed second phase oxide. An analogue to our system, which could serve as a basis for comparison, namely the Co/Mo/Al203 hy- drodesulfurization catalyst, was not consid- ered. This catalyst system has been studied in detail and considerable information on the structure of the catalyst is available (29). In the original monolayer model proposed by Schuit and Gates (30), it was concluded that most of the Co resided within the alu- mina. However, Johnson et al. (31) using a battery of techniques demonstrated that a significant fraction of Co does not and that Co and Mo interact. This was the same con- clusion reached by Topsoe and Topsoe (32), who showed, using IR spectra of adsorbed NO, that an interaction between Co and Mo exists. Like Mo(VI), W(VI) forms tung- states. Pertinent to this discussion are those structures characterized by WO6 octahedra. The structure of these crystals is a distorted hexagonal close-packed array of oxide ions with tungsten in octahedral holes; the diva- lent Co cations are located in two sets of nonequivalent distorted octahedral sites (33). There is considerable controversy in the literature as to whether tungsten oxide is octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated to the alumina surface (2, 34). If the former case exists, it could serve as an anchoring site for Co2+ adsorption during catalyst preparation. This cobalt-containing phase would be highly dispersed at low Co weight loading tracking the WO3 dispersity but could form a contiguous structure in its oxi- dized state when loadings of 6% are consid- ered. Recall the decrease in particle size for the reduced composite, subsequent to reduction, that we report based on XPS data. Regions of the 76-nm oxidized parti- cles that were not \"rich\" in a Co2+-W phase could be reduced and they along with the more active Co2+-W would become the catalytic centers for the enhanced activation of CO bond breaking. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated the concept of se- lective metal-support exchange in the Co-WO3/A1203 system. Composite oxides, the pzc's of which lie between the pzc values of the pure phases, appear to provide novel support systems for catalyst design. When a catalytic metal such as cobalt is directed primarily to the dispersed phase of the com- posite, we find that its resulting catalytic performance is unique. The higher activity observed for the com- posite catalyst compared to Co/Al203 would correlate with formation of a more active species on the composite catalyst. Such spe- cies may consist of oxidic and reduced Co'-+-W interaction species and possibly some reduced Co304 that is in contact with these species. We do not favor interpreting the active center as cobalt tungstate. Here, as observed by many, surface compounds can form on oxide catalysts that have no bulk analogues. In this system, we simply have the possibility of forming a more com- plex inventory of these surface compounds. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by NSF under Grant CBT- 8900514.

The differences in the amphoteric properties Of WO3 and Al2O3 were exploited and cobalt precursors were selectively mounted on the tungsten oxide phase of a 12% WO3/Al2O3 composite. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPRd), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and catalyst performance testing using H2/CO methanation as a test reaction revealed that this composite-supported catalyst's properties were significantly different from cobalt supported on alumina. Cobalt crystallites as well as a CoAl2O4 type of surface species are formed on the Al2O3 support. The presence of WO3 as a second-phase oxide offers the possibility for a greater number of surface compounds to be formed on the composite. Specifically, cobalt-tungsten interaction species are formed. We provide evidence that strongly suggests the active catalytic center in the conversion of H2 and CO to methane is a (cobalt-tungsten) interaction species. These active centers. are present on CO/WO3, Co/12% WO3/Al2O3, and a commercial cobalt/tungsten oxide compound. A portion of the cobalt: in these active centers is not reduced to the metallic state.
