Graphical abstract Under atmospheric pressure, nano-polyethylene fibres were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization, with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) catalytic systems, respectively. Experimental results indicate the geometrical structures and surface properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15 have strongly effects on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene, catalytic activity and polymerization rate. Moreover, the resultant polyethylene had higher melting points compared to the homogeneous counterpart. Under atmospheric pressure, nano-polyethylene fibres were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization, with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) catalytic systems, respectively. The effects of the geometrical structures and surface properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15 on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene, catalytic activity and polymerization rate were investigated and compared in various polymerization conditions. The possible formation mechanism of nano-polyethylene fibres with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported Cp2ZrCl2 as catalyst was discussed. Keywords MCM-41 and SBA-15 Ethylene polymerization Nano-polyethylene fibres Atmospheric pressure 1 Introduction Recently, a large number of researches, about heterogeneous metallocene catalysts supported on inorganic and organic materials, have been published [1–7]. The discovery of the M41S family of mesoporous zeolites has greatly increased the range of supports for preparing heterogeneous catalysts. MCM-41 and SBA-15 have regular, cylindrical, ordered hexagonal pores, with narrow pore size distribution and large surface area [8,9]. Their pore diameters are larger (2–10nm) compared to common zeolites, enabling large metallocene molecules to be immobilized not only onto the surface but also inside the pores of the supports. Braca et al. [10] and Michellotti et al. [11] reported that mesoporous zeolites were suitable supports due to the possibility of entrapping organometallic complexes in their large mesoporous channels. Furthermore, the geometrical shape of the nano-channels can serve as polymerization reactors to affect the pattern of monomer insertion and to control polymer chain structure, polymer chains arrangement and polymer morphology. Aida and co-workers [12] first synthesized crystalline line polyethylene nano-fibres with MSF supported titanocene dichloride (Cp2TiCl2) catalysts at ethylene pressure 10atm, and termed as extrusion polymerization. Ye et al. [13] also prepared PE nano-fibres with MCM-41 supported Cp2TiCl2 at higher ethylene pressure (20atm). In this work, nano-polyethylene fibres were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization with Cp2ZrCl2 immobilized on MCM-41 and SBA-15 under atmospheric pressure. The influence of structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 and the different polymerization conditions on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene fibres and catalytic activities were investigated and compared in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All manipulations were carried out by the standard Schlenk technique under argon atmosphere. Zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) was synthesized according to the literature [14]. MAO was purchased from Aldrich as 10wt% aluminium solution in toluene. Polymerization-grade ethylene was purified using three columns of KOH, CuO and 4A molecular sieve. Toluene was refluxed over sodium with benzophenone as indicator and distilled under argon atmosphere before use. 2.2 Preparation of the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts MCM-41 and SBA-15 were synthesized by methods analogous to those reported in literatures [15,16]. The resultant white precipitate was filtrated, washed and calcined in air at 550°C for 5 and 8h, respectively. The weighed MCM-41 or SBA-15 was mixed with MAO in 50ml toluene. After being stirred for 2h at room temperature, the solid was collected and washed three times with toluene. Subsequently, the MAO pretreated sample was mixed with stoichiometrical amount of Cp2ZrCl2 in 50ml toluene. After being stirred for 1h at 50°C, the resultant solid was collected and washed three times with fresh toluene. The supported catalyst was dried in vacuum at room temperature. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to measure the supported Zr amount on MCM-41 and SBA-15, respectively. 2.3 Ethylene extrusion polymerization Under atmospheric pressure, ethylene extrusion polymerization was carried out in a 100ml flask equipped with an ethylene inlet, a magnetic stirrer and connected to vacuum line. At selected polymerization temperature, toluene was introduced into the flask and saturated with ethylene, then were added the required MAO and supported catalyst. The polymerization was terminated at a fixed time by adding acidified ethanol. The polymer was separated by filtration and dried under vacuum to constant weight. 2.4 Characterization of the resultant polyethylene The melting points (T m) of polyethylene were measured with a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The polyethylene sample (ca. 4mg) was heated to 170°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Polyethylene morphology was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SIRION, FEI, USA). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of polyethylene were obtained on a D/max-3BX diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 0.154nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of MCM-41 and SBA-15 MCM-41 and SBA-15 samples with different pore diameter and surface properties were used as supports for Cp2ZrCl2 catalysts in this work. MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been studied extensively by our group [17,18]. The structural parameters of the MCM-41 and SBA-15 samples are listed in Table 1 . Both MCM-41 and SBA-15 have narrow pore diameter distribution, as shown in Fig. 1 . 3.2 Ethylene polymerization and polyethylene characterization Under atmospheric pressure, ethylene polymerization was carried out with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalytic systems. Table 2 listed the polymerization reaction conditions, polymerization activity and melting points of the resultant polyethylene. 3.2.1 Effect of supports on polymerization activities The activities of the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalytic systems for ethylene polymerization were about 30% of those of the homogeneous system (Table 2). Similar results had been reported elsewhere [19]. This could be attributed to the deactivation of some of the active sites on reaction with MCM-41 and SBA-15 and could also owe to the steric hindrance in the pore of MCM-41 and SBA-15. The polymerization activities increased drastically with the increase in the reaction temperature. The activities of the two heterogeneous catalytic systems were similar. The influences of supports on the ethylene polymerization rate are shown in Fig. 2 . It was believed that the difference in the polymerization rate for the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts was due to the difference in the pore diameters and surface areas. 3.2.2 Effect of supports on melting points of polyethylene The melting points of the polyethylene prepared by supported catalytic system, particularly MCM-41 supported catalysts, were higher than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalytic system. This is probably attributed to the control of channels over the arrangement of polyethylene chains. The channel diameter of mesoporous sieves (29 and 56.4Å) is smaller than the lamellar thickness (270Å) of the folded-chain crystals of ordinary polyethylene [20]. When the ethylene monomers pass into the channel, the wall of the channel can control the direction of ethylene propagation, form polyethylene extended-chains and then form extended-chains crystals. The extended-chains crystals are beneficial to increasing the melting points. The schematic illustration of the process is shown in Fig. 3 . The melting points of polyethylene prepared by MCM-41 supported catalysts were higher than those prepared by SBA-15 supported catalysts. It is reasonable that this is attributed to the difference in the pore diameter between MCM-41 and SBA-15. Firstly, SBA-15 with larger pore diameter is not easy to control the chains structure thoroughly to obtain complete extended-chains; secondly, some extended-chains are not controlled very well by the channels and can change to folded-chains again without crystallizing. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the polyethylene samples prepared with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalytic systems. Typical orthorhombic crystal structure for the crystalline PE with [110] and [200] diffraction peaks at 21.2° and 24°, respectively, testifies the existence of extended-chains crystals [13]. The small amorphous halo around 19.4°, particularly the sample prepared with SBA-15 supported catalyst, indicates the existence of folded-chains. 3.3 Morphology of the resultant polyethylene 3.3.1 Effect of the supports on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene The morphologies of the resultant polyethylene were studied with SEM in detail. Fig. 5(a and b) shows the SEM micrographs of polyethylene prepared by MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalytic systems for 10min, respectively. It is clear that, owing to the control of the channels of MCM-41 and SBA-15 over the polyethylene chains, the resultant polyethylene presents nano-fibre morphologies with smooth surface. Fig. 6 shows the scheme for the formation of the nano-fibres through mesoporous channel [12]. Comparison between Fig. 5(a and b) indicates that the nano-fibres prepared by SBA-15 are larger in diameter than those prepared by MCM-41 supported catalyst. This result is due to the difference in the pore diameter between SBA-15 and MCM-41. SBA-15 has larger pore diameter than MCM-41, containing more polyethylene chains in the pore. 3.3.2 Effect of polymerization temperature on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene In order to explore how the polymerization temperature affects the polymer morphology, we also observed the morphology of the resultant polyethylene prepared with SBA-15 and MCM-41 supported catalytic systems at 70°C, as shown in Fig. 7 . The fibre morphology can be observed in the polyethylene prepared by MCM-41 supported catalyst, while the polyethylene prepared by SBA-15 supported catalyst presents non-fibre morphology. Possible reason is that with the increase in polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate increases. With the propagation of polyethylene chains, the framework of MCM-41 could keep the original channel structure. The channels could control the chains inside the pore and form polyethylene fibres (Fig. 7(a)). SBA-15 channels have larger diameter and may contain more polyethylene chains than MCM-41, which make the SBA-15 channels broken into small particles under high polymerization rate. Therefore, the polyethylene may follow the so-called replica phenomenon and resembles the broken support particles (Fig. 7(b)). 4 Conclusions Under atmospheric pressure, nano-polyethylene fibres can be prepared via ethylene extrusion polymerization in situ with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic systems. The diameters of the resultant fibres prepared with SBA-15 supported catalysts are larger than those prepared with MCM-41 supported catalysts. At the polymerization temperature of 70°C, the fibre morphology of the polyethylene prepared with SBA-15 supported catalytic system disappeared. Furthermore, the resultant polyethylene had higher melting points compared to the homogeneous counterpart, particularly the samples prepared with MCM-41 supported catalysts.
