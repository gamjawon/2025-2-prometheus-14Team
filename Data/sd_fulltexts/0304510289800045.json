KRAMER and M. FISCHBACHER Institut fur Physikalische Chemie, Uniuersitat Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck (Austria) Summary The effect of different hydrogen pretreatments on the catalytic per- formance of supported platinum was investigated in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane on catalysts of different dispersions. These catalysts were prepared either by sintering of conventional supported catalysts or by HV-deposition of platinum onto amorphous films of silica or alumina (model catalysts). A hydrogen pretreatment at 400 C resulted in a lower activity and in a selectivity shift to less n-hexane formation compared to results with hydrogen pretreatment at 275 C. The effect of high temperature pre- treatment was most pronounced with evaporated model catalysts. Further- more, this effect was stronger on catalysts of higher dispersion. From these results, conclusions are drawn concerning the mechanism of the hydrogen- olysis of methylcyclopentane and the effect of hydrogen pretreatment on this reaction. Introduction Hydrogen pretreatment effects on the catalytic performance of metals supported by titania and other 'reducible' oxides are widely discussed in the literature (for a review, see [1]) and sometimes related to strong metal sup- port interaction effects (SMSI). When 'nonreducible' oxides such as silica or alumina are used, a smaller but distinct effect of the reduction temperature on the activity of supported platinum is observed. This was attributed to (i) alloy formation [2], (ii) tightly bound hydrogen competing for platinum surface sites [3], (iii) changes in the surface morphologies [4], or (iv) struc- tural changes in the support by hydrogen spillover [5], which can, in turn, affect the catalytic behaviour of the metal. In order to better distinguish between these proposed mechanisms, we have studied the extent of the hydrogen pretreatment effect on platinum catalysts of different dispersions or on different supporting materials. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 248 As the test reaction for such an investigation, we chose the hydrogenoly- sis of methylcyclopentane (MCP), a reaction which is sensitive to particle size. In particular, the selectivity of the hydrogenolysis of MCP can help as a probe of the high temperature pretreatment effect. In preliminary studies [5] we found that hydrogen pretreatment at 400 C instead of the standard pretreatment at 250 C distinctly affects the activity as well as the selectivity of Pt/SiO; catalysts for this reaction. The 'high' temperature of pretreatment applied in this work (400 C) was still rather low in comparison to the temperatures usually applied to obtain SMSI-like phenomena. This temperature was chosen in order to avoid sintering during pretreatment, but also to suppress the formation of tightly bound hydrogen, which was reported to occur during hydrogen pretreatment above 400 C [3]. Experimental Preparation of model catalysts For preparing model catalysts and TEM-specimens, either Al^Oy or SiC>2 was deposited onto freshly polished aluminum foil (0.015 mm thick- ness, 170 cm2 area) and onto carbon-coated TEM grids by evaporating aluminum (via electron bombardment heating) or silicon monoxide (from a tungsten crucible) in an oxygen atmosphere of 1.3 X 10~4 mbar. Then both the foil and the TEM-grids were treated in air at 500 C for at least 2 h. During this air treatment, the support films were completely oxidized to SiOz and A^O^, and the carbon films were burnt off the TEM specimens, leaving self-supporting support films on the grids. Thereafter, platinum was deposited by HV evaporation (via electron bombardment heating) at a pres- sure of 1.3 X 10~6 mbar. The amount of platinum was measured by a quartz crystal oscillator. Model catalysts of different dispersions could be prepared by varying the amount of platinum deposited. The catalyst and grids were always treated together in the reactor, and TEM specimens were examined in the electron microscope (Zeiss EM 10C) after being removed from the catalytic reactor. Sintering of EUROPT-1 and EUROPT-3 The original catalysts for sintering were EUROPT-1 (6.3% Pt/SiO^ standard catalyst, characterized by several laboratories [6]) and EUROPT-3 (0.3% Pt/AlzOa reforming catalyst). A sample of EUROPT-1, placed in a quartz tube, was heated in flowing hydrogen to 950 C for 1 h. The EUROPT-3 catalyst was sintered in the reactor during a hydrogen treatment, when traces of air were admitted accidentally. In this case the sintering con- ditions were not controlled and the catalyst was characterized afterwards by electron microscopy. 249 Preparation for TEM characterization For preparing TEM specimens of the conventionally supported catal- ysts, the samples were ground and dispersed in water by ultrasonic vibration. The catalyst powder was transferred to the carbon coated TEM grids by two different preparation procedures: (i) the TEM grid was put upside down on top of droplets of the catalyst suspension and the catalyst particles came into contact with the carbon film only by Brownian motion, (ii) The TEM grid was put onto filter paper and a small droplet of the catalyst suspension was brought onto the grid, from where the excess solution was immediately removed by the filter paper. Adsorption measurements The adsorption measurements were made volumetrically in a glass appa- ratus, which was primarily constructed for measuring small amounts of adsorbed gases and has been described previously [7]. Catalytic measurement The recirculation reactor was used as described earlier [7]. Before each reaction the catalyst was heated in flowing oxygen (1 ml s~1) at 400 C, then cooled to room temperature, evacuated, and eventually reduced in flowing hydrogen (1 ml s~1) at either 275 C (low temperature reduction - LTR) or 400 C (high temperature reduction - HTR). The reaction temperature was generally 275 C, the standard initial pressure of MCP was 8 mbar and hydrogen was admitted to 1 bar total pres- sure. From the conversion-time behaviour (measured up to 1 h) the catalyst activity could be evaluated as a function of decreasing MCP pressure and in- creasing partial pressure of products. Results Electron microscopy Model catalysts are well suited for TEM characterization because of the relatively uniform contrast of the amorphous supporting films. As shown in Fig. 1, the particles exhibit predominantly spherical or possibly icosahedral shape, and their density and size distribution can easily be measured. By balancing the size of the platinum particles with the mass of platinum de- posited (measured by the quartz crystal oscillator), the height of the parti- cles can be estimated. This is an important parameter for translating particle size measurements into dispersion, and vice versa. For the model catalysts used here, the particle height was found about equal to the diameter, and therefore more or less full spheres can be assumed. In the case of severe sintering of a catalyst from a particle size of 2.5 nm to a particle size of 7 nm, as is shown in Fig. 2, a halo is seen around each platinum particle, indicating that a structural change of the support has occurred during the heat treatment in hydrogen. 250 100 nm Fig. 1. Micrographs of the Pt/SiOz model catalysts with 0.3 nm (a), 0.5 nm (b), 0.7 nm (c), and 1.3 nm (d) mean thickness of platinum. The evaluation of micrographs of conventionally supported catalysts by TEM is more difficult, because the contrast of the support changes markedly within small distances [8]. For EUROPT-1, the evaluation of particles in regions of light background contrast resulted in a mean particle size of 1.55 nm. On regions of enhanced background (Fig. 3), a larger particle size of 1.78 nm is obtained, which leads to the conclusion that with a darker and more structured background very small particles are possibly beyond the limit of detection, and that the commonly accepted mean particle size of 1.8 nm for the EUROPT-1 [6] may be too large. The corresponding micrograph of the sintered EUROPT-1 showed a narrow distribution of particle size (d = 3 nm), at least when specimens pre- pared by procedure (i) (see Experimental) are examined (Fig. 4a). Generally, the same mean diameter of particles is also observed on micrographs pre- pared by method (ii), but also several much larger particles are found on these micrographs. These large particles appear separated from the support 100 nm 100 nm Fig. 2. Micrograph of a Pt/AlO model catalyst, which has been sintered severely in hydrogen. Fig. 3.

The removal of metal particles from the support during specimen preparation has already been reported for Rh/SiO; catalysts [9]. Such a removal of platinum from the support could cause an enrichment of platinum in the fine grain fraction of the catalyst [6]. From inspection of the micrographs of EUROPT-3, it can be concluded that no particles larger than 1.5 nm are present. In the micrographs of the sintered EUROPT-3, however, platinum particles with a mean size of about 3.0 nm are easily identified. 100 nm Fig. 4. Micrographs of the sintered EUROPT-1: (a) specimen prepared by method (i) (see Experimental); (b) specimen prepared by method (ii), showing accumulation of platinum particles separated from the support. Chemisorption measurement Because of the small platinum surface area available in the model catal- ysts (about 150 cm2), characterization by volumetric measurement cannot be done with sufficient accuracy. On the other hand, the conventionally sup- ported catalysts were additionally characterized by adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen (both at room temperature and extrapolated to zero pressure) as shown in Table 1. For EUROPT-1, a H/Pt ratio of 1.03 is calculated. How- ever, in earlier work [6] a dispersion of 0.64 has been obtained, based upon electron microscopic results, and we adopt this value as an operational parameter, although electron microscopic results of this work indicate a slightly higher degree of dispersion. For the sintered EUROPT-1, both the hydrogen and the oxygen adsorption capacities are reduced by a factor of 0.24 compared to the original EUROPT-1. Thus, assuming the same surface stoichiometry for both catalysts, the dispersion of the sintered EUROPT-1 is taken to be 24% of that of the original EUROPT-1, i.e. 0.15. For this catal- yst, by TEM a particle size of 3.0 nm is found, but some very large particles are found, which contribute negligibly to the surface area but contain a sub- stantial part of the volume of platinum. Thus, considering the particle size of 3.0 nm, the relatively low dispersion of 0.15 becomes feasible. For EUROPT-3, both the H/Pt and 0/Pt ratios are larger than those for EUROPT-1 by about 20%. Using the same procedure as above, a dispersion 262 TABLE 1 Catalyst characterization Catalyst specification81 Catalyst characterization Dispersion d by TEM H/Pt1' 0/Pt11 (nm) Pt/Si02 model 3 A m.th. 2.7 35 5 A m.th. 3.3 30 7 A m.th. 4.6 20 13 A m.th. 6.6 13 EUROPT-1 6.3% Pt/Si02 1.6 1.03 0.53 64 EUROPT-1, sintered 3.0 0.25 0.12 IS'1 Pt/AliOs model 2 A m.th. 2.5 4 A m.th. 2.8 6 A m.th. 9.0 35 30 1-1 J L 1&J.U*A> &f *V \\-\\J EUROPT-3 0.3%Pt/Al203 <1.5 1.24 0.60 100 EUROPT-3, sintered 3.0 30 'Mean platinum thickness in case of model catalysts, platinum content in case of con- ventional catalysts.

On the other hand, from the absolute H/Pt ratio (1.24) a dispersion of 100% seems more justified, and will be used in this work for the calculation of TOF values. Catalytic measurements At a reaction temperature of 275 C the products ofMCP hydrogenol- ysis were 2-methylpentane (2-MP), 3-methylpentane (3-MP), and n-hexane (n-H). Only with EUROPT-3 minor amounts of smaller hydrocarbons were obtained, but their fraction never exceeded 10% of the total conversion. During the course of reaction the turnover of MCP molecules per unit time decreased about linearly with the amount of products formed, as shown in Fig. 5. With EUROPT-3 it was proved that this loss in activity was not due to the decrease of MCP partial pressure during the reaction. If the initial pressure of MCP in the reaction mixture was 16 mbar and 80 mbar respec- tively, instead of the standard pressure of 8 mbar, the turnover of molecules per unit time was not changed, but the activity decreased again during the course of reaction with increasing partial pressure of products in the reaction mixture. On the other hand, the selectivity was not changed during the course of reaction. However, most of the initial activity (more than 95%) could be restored by sweeping the catalyst with hydrogen for 1 h at the reac- tion temperature. In this hydrogen sweeping, traces of all three main reac- tion products were desorbed. This result points to a self-inhibition of the 253 150 a QA A 100 AD a 50 0 2 4 6 8 10 PARTIAL PRESSURE OF PRODUCTS / MBAR Fig. 6.

For determining the activity of the catalysts, the initial activity is therefore evaluated from the conversion within the first 5 min of contact time. After a standard pretreatment (LTR), the TOP for MCP hydrogeno lysis was about 40 h~1 at 275 C for the model catalysts used. However, the EUROPT-1 catalyst showed a smaller turnover number of about 15 h~1, and the EUROPT-3 catalyst exhibited a far higher activity of 130 h~1 at 275 C. The product distribution depends on the size of the platinum particles (Table 2) according to the structure sensitivity of this reaction, i.e. the selec- tivity for n-hexane increases with increasing dispersion. On the model catal- ysts, the ratio of the proportion of branched products 2-MP/3-MP changed from about 3.6 on moderately dispersed catalysts to about 3.8 on poorly dispersed catalysts. On the other hand, on the conventionally prepared catalysts of high dispersion this ratio was 3.3 for EUROPT-1, for sintered EUROPT-1 and for sintered EUROPT-3. The ratio obtained with unsintered EUROPT-3 (1.7) distinctly differs from that obtained with the other catalysts. The high temperature hydrogen treatment of silica-supported platinum caused a decrease in activity. The fraction of initial activity retained after this treatment ranged from about 45% on highly dispersed platinum to 70% with a catalyst of low dispersion. The alumina-supported model catalysts were far more affected by HTR treatment, retaining less than 10% of the initial activity. In contrast, the catalysts derived from EUROPT-1 and EUROPT-3 were less affected by the high temperature reduction. >*T3 ^ +a 0) W :? a\" < 3-3S -S.S '*< ^ h 0) .-^3& loomooo oioooo^(OtOOC-C^ r-t r-lCROS & ?co fc 10 ^ tOt~000 C CO <0<000t--t0 N COCOCOCOCOCO COC*3COi 4CO ,0 tB ffi 1 10 10 T-it-liON-^CO OCO-^IOCO (N -1 COCil CMi-1 CTi-l a 1 0 co i fri .0 ^ >o(D<Ooococo <0t oor-io \"s *-> IN co co co co co co co co co T I co CO ^ s g -4- C^J 5 o 1a wi in otOoo^row ioco>o<o<oCOl-l ^'(M <Nl-l COr-1 a 0 a S.^tQ '\"\"\" loooco-^rio 100000 F^ k0Q& COCOINr-ltOl-f COCOT-IOCO r-1 m ^' 0 .... 0 . . . \" S-gS-gM -S-S-g^ e e e e& sees, < < <<<;ES < < < a coior-co\" (MTti<o1\" r-l 10 0 aC 3 'g 2 '4J ^ h g OJ <5 ^3 ^ .'\" ^ .'3 Qi 2 '-< '-i S co co COI 3 5 s ^ E1' \" ^ E1*0 ^ 0\" ^S 3 rtrt ^ rtrt s- 0& s- & &CL| If) H cm H B 255 In addition to activity, the selectivity also changed when the tempera- ture of hydrogen pretreatment was 400 C instead of 275 C. As shown in Table 2, for all catalysts the proportion of n-hexane in the products de- creased after HTR treatment. Again, the shift in selectivity was more pro- nounced with the model catalysts. When similarly prepared catalysts are compared, the shift in n-hexane proportion is stronger for the catalysts of higher dispersion. On the other hand, for EUROPT-3 hardly any shift in selectivity was observed. The ratio of the branched products 2-MP/3-MP was only slightly affected by the HTR treatment, resulting in a small shift towards less 2-MP formation. The effect of high temperature reduction was easily reversed by treat- ment in oxygen. Even an oxygen treatment at room temperature followed by reduction at 275 C was sufficient to re-establish the initial product dis- tribution and most of the initial activity. However, the full initial activity was regained only after standard pretreatment (O;, 400 C, H;, 275 C). In contrast, the activity of EUROPT-3 increased after the first HTR-LTR treat- ment. Further sequential increases in activity were found during a few fur- ther HTR-LTR cycles, but thereafter the activity and selectivity remained constant. In Table 2 only the data obtained with this stabilized catalyst are considered. Discussion Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the structure sensi- tivity in the ring opening of methylcyclopentane on platinum. Gault and coworkers [10] postulated that on large platinum particles selective ring opening proceeds via an Q!,o:^,|3-tetraadsorbed species, followed by cleavage of the bond between the a and (3 carbon atoms. In this pathway 2-MP and 3-MP should be formed selectively, while formation of n-H is excluded. The non-selective ring opening was assumed to occur on a,aJ3-triadsorbed species bound to comer or edge atoms [II], which occur more frequently on small particles. More recently, Paal and Tetenyi [12] suggested a flat-lying Cg-ring adsorbed parallel to the surface as an intermediate for selective ring opening of MCP. The effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the rate of ring closure and ring opening supports the assumption of a less dehydrogenated inter- mediate, like that proposed by Paal. We have proposed an alternative mechanism for the non-selective ring opening [13, 14] based on the idea that platinum atoms at the phase bound- ary to the support are responsible for the formation of n-hexane from MCP. This concept of adiineation can explain the effect of particle size on the selectivity of this reaction, since the fraction of platinum atoms adjacent to the support is larger on small particles. In addition, it can explain the influ- ence of the support on the activity of the adiineation sites. Further evidence for this mechanism was obtained from experiments on model catalysts, where the fraction of sites at the phase boundary was systematically changed 256 without changing the size of the platinum particles [14]. The results con- firmed that the selectivity depends primarily on the fraction of platinum atoms adjacent to the support. The hydrogen treatment at a temperature of 400 C instead of 275 C distinctly affected the catalytic performance. The pronounced shift in activ- ity and in selectivity obtained with catalysts of higher dispersion and, in addition, the direction of the selectivity shift to less n-hexane, indicate that actually the adiineation sites are predominantly affected by the HTR treat- ment. Thus it is most likely that this treatment causes structural changes of the support, or at least of the phase boundary platinum-support. The structure of this platinum-support phase boundary has been in- vestigated in several recent studies. In ESR measurements on Ft/A^O^ Huizinga and Prins [15] found that even after reduction at 350 C Pt+ ions are present in the catalysts, which are probably situated at the metal- support interface. In a similar manner, Mansour et al. [16] concluded from X-ray adsorption spectroscopy that again after hydrogen treatment platinum particles are electron-deficient compared to bulk platinum. However, reduc- tion at higher temperature causes a shift of electrons to the platinum, es- pecially in the platinum/alumina system. These authors state \"that the reduction conditions should also affect the catalytic behaviour particularly for structure sensitive reactions\". Since the electric field produced by this charge transfer is screened in the metal within a few interatomic distances, the positive charge remaining at the Pt particles is localized to the interface between platinum and the support, in agreement with the conclusions drawn by Huizinga and Prins [15]. From EXAFS and XANES results, Lytle and co- workers [17, 18] come to quite similar conclusions. In particular, the platinum atoms at the interface were found to form a Pt-0 bond to the sup- port. This bond is broken by heating above 327 C, causing a backflow of electrons to the platinum. In view of these recent results, we want to replace the model for the catalytically active adiineation sites given previously on the basis of geomet- ric arrangements by a less pictorial one, based upon localized charge transfer occurring at the phase boundary. Considering the claim by Botmann and coworkers [19] that positively-charged platinum should exhibit a catalytic behaviour differing from that of metallic platinum, we assume that the platinum atoms adjacent to the support are positively charged. These adiine- ation sites yield a product distribution in the MCP ring opening that is dif- ferent from that obtained at 'bulk' platinum sites. The effect of the sup- porting material on the activity of the adiineation sites is then due to the dif- ferent ability of the support to withdraw electrons from the platinum. This ability can, in turn, correlate with the surface acidity of the support and can possibly be enhanced by the presence of positively charged cations such as Ti^[20]. The extent of charge transfer can be changed by cleavage of the Pt-0 bond at temperatures above 350 C [15] or above 327 C [17, 18]. If the catalysts are pretreated in hydrogen at a temperature of 400 C, instead of 257 275 C, the oxygen at the phase boundary is most likely saturated by hy- drogen supplied to the support by hydrogen spillover [21]. After this treat- ment, a part of the platinum atoms at the phase boundary may have lost the positive charge and may therefore have changed their catalytic behaviour to that of 'metallic' platinum. The Pt/AL^ catalysts used in this work showed generally the same trends as did the Pt/SiOi catalysts, but some differences should be discussed. The commercial reforming catalyst EUROPT-3 needed several oxidation- reduction treatments before it provided reproducible results. After this in- duction period, the catalyst was substantially more active for MCP hydro- genolysis than the other catalysts. Also, the product distribution differed dis- tinctly from that of EUROPT-1, which has a comparable dispersion. Com- pared to EUROPT-1, the n-H proportion obtained with EUROPT-3 was slightly smaller and the ratio of 2-MP/3-MP was distinctly smaller. Further- more, the EUROPT-3 catalyst was hardly affected by the HTR treatment. There may be several reasons for this 'abnormal' behaviour of EUROPT-3: (i) The chlorine content in EUROPT-3 provides Pt-Cl bonds instead of Pt-0 bonds at the phase boundary. The different environment of the platinum atoms could then be responsible for the higher activity, the different product distribution and for the higher stability of the Pt-Cl bond in the hydrogen pretreatment. (ii) The high activity of EUROPT-3 could also be caused by an additional pathway of ring opening, either on the platinum surface, as is as- sumed by Paal [22], starting at about 300 C, or on the support via a bi- functional mechanism. This type of mechanism is typical of reforming catal- ysts, at least at higher temperatures. Actually, the ratio of the activities of EUROPT-3 and EUROPT-1 is nearly 9 at 275 C, but only 3 at 250 C. The stronger increase of activity with temperature obtained with EUROPT-3 points to the onset of an additional reaction route in this temperature region. Also, the formation of smaller hydrocarbons obtained with EUROPT-3 indicates a contribution of additional pathways to the overall reaction. On the other hand, the selectivity is hardly influenced by the reaction temperature, which should be the case if at the higher temperature an alternative pathway with a different product pattern contributes more strongly to the overall reaction. On the other hand, the catalyst derived from EUROPT-3 by sintering in situ in hydrogen behaved quite normally. Besides sintering the platinum, this treatment might have changed the support structure, either by removing chlorine or by altering the bulk structure of the alumina. Further investi- gation of EUROPT-3 with special emphasis on the coordination of the plati- num at the interface to the support could possibly facilitate the interpreta- tion of the catalytic behaviour of this catalyst. In contrast to EUROPT-3, the activity of the Pt/A^Oa model catalysts is drastically affected by hydrogen pretreatment at 400 C. The support of this catalyst is a 20 nm thick alumina layer deposited on aluminium foil. The special design of these catalysts could be the reason for this strong effect. By contacting the alumina film with aluminum, the thermodynamic activity of 258 aluminum can be drastically enhanced, if aluminum or oxygen atoms are enabled to diffuse through the alumina film. The treatment in hydrogen at 400 C could provide the mobility and the reducing atmosphere necessary for the formation of a Pt-Al alloy [2] or a Pt-Al^O-i ensemble [23]. In further work we want to repeat these experiments using similar platinum- alumina model catalysts, in which the contact of aluminum and alumina is inhibited by a diffusional barrier layer. The participation of the support in the hydrogen pretreatment effect can also be seen in the micrograph of the alumina-supported model catalyst (Fig. 2), which has been severely heated in hydrogen. Although the TEM specimen of the catalyst does not contain any supporting metallic aluminum, the heat treatment evidently caused a structural change in the support around the platinum particle, as has been previously reported to occur on silica-supported platinum [24]. The halo formation is most likely due to a partial reduction of the alumina surface via spillover of hydrogen. In summary, the results of this work show a distinct effect of hydrogen pretreatment on the selectivity of MCP hydrogenolysis. In general, the model catalysts were affected more strongly by this treatment than the convention- ally prepared catalysts. Within one series of similarly prepared catalysts, the loss of activity and the change in selectivity is larger for the catalysts of high- er dispersion. From these results, a model for the structure of the adiineation sites was derived by assuming a positive charge localized at the platinum atoms adjacent to the support. References 1 R. Burch, in Z.

Kramer M. Fischbacher Institut für Physikalische Chemie, Universität Innsbruck, A-6020 InnsbruckAustria The effect of different hydrogen pretreatments on the catalytic performance of supported platinum was investigated in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane on catalysts of different dispersions. These catalysts were prepared either by sintering of conventional supported catalysts or by HV-deposition of platinum onto amorphous films of silica or alumina (model catalysts). A hydrogen pretreatment at 400 °C resulted in a lower activity and in a selectivity shift to less n-hexane formation compared to results with hydrogen pretreatment at 275 °C. The effect of high temperature pre-treatment was most pronounced with evaporated model catalysts. Further-more, this effect was stronger on catalysts of higher dispersion. From these results, conclusions are drawn concerning the mechanism of the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and the effect of hydrogen pretreatment on this reaction. References 1 R. Burch Z.
