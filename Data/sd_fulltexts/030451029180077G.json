Niezapominajek, 30-239 Cracow (Poland) (Received November 16, 1990; revised March 6, 1991) Abstract A simple model approach is proposed to describe the penetration of an extra electron, transferred from a chemisorbed molecule, onto the surface of a vanadium oxide catalyst. The model provides conclusions regarding the probable penetration range. The necessary numerical parameters are estimated from the results of semiempirical SINDO calculations performed for small molecular clusters. Introduction In numerous attempts to rationalize various cases of heterogeneous catalysis, quantum theoretical methods have been extensively used [ 1-6 J. There are at least two approaches that may be alternatively applied to that end. They are essentially complementary. On the one hand, there are standard methods of solid state theory [1, 2, 7]. Their application usually implies the emphasis on the properties of the catalyst rather than of the reactant molecules. The catalyst is normally treated as an infinite crystal, and its translational symmetry is used to simplify the calculations. The adsorbed reactants are essentially viewed as incidental and characterized only superficially by means of parameters referring to the corresponding free molecules. The neglect of the changes in the adsorbed molecule due to its interaction with the substrate makes this approach very questionable in the case of strong and chemically specific sorption. On the other hand, more popular recently are standard methods of quantum chemistry [4, 8-11 ]. They were originally developed to treat individual, isolated molecules. Consequently, they are not geared to deal with a macroscopic system like a crystal, and their application must be confined to small model clusters, more or less artificially separated from the catalyst crystal which they are meant to describe. As the model cluster and the adsorbed molecule are both considered as parts of a single supermolecule where all the interactions are treated on an equal footing, the great advantage 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 224 of these methods consists in their ability to account for the complexities of the chemical interaction between the reactants and the catalyst substrate, no matter how strong this interaction is. The disadvantage is that the clusters must be finite and rather small to make the problem tractable. Consequently, the solutions are expected to be rather sensitive to boundary conditions, and those are usually difficult to define in an entirely plausible way. To the best of our knowledge, only in the case of chemisorption on metal surfaces have successful calculations been done for large and satisfactorily defined model clusters. A variety of methods has been used in that context [9, 12-161. However, a quantum chemical treatment of metal bulk within the cluster scheme is itself a complicated problem, since the properties of metals are governed by intrinsically non-local effects. The other systems of great importance for catalysis are the transition metal oxides. In their case, the cluster must be extracted, somewhat artificially, from the structure of strong covalent bonds, so that the balance in the number of electrons, valence etc., is maintained [ 17, 181. Due to its small size, the cluster can hardly act as an electron reservoir, while just this may be an important factor of its catalytic activity. Also, if the model were to describe the catalyst as a `bridge' for electron transfer between different reactant molecules adsorbed at the surface some distance apart [3, 61, prohibitively large clusters would have to be considered. The objective of the present paper is to propose an approach, which, although simplistic, would allow to incorporate some of the detailed information gathered from quantum chemical cluster-type calculations, in a model in which at least some features of the crystal surface as a whole could be imitated. Model catalysts We will deal specifically with the catalysts based on vanadium oxides (molybdenum oxides can probably be treated in a similar way). The crystals of these compounds may be thought of as composed of VOs octahedra [ 19, 201 (cf. Fig. 1 a). The metal is located in the centre of the square base shared by the two pyramids which form the octahedron. The plane of the square base coincides with the (010) plane of the crystal. One of the two pyramids is elongated, so that the distance from the metal atom to the oxygen atom located above (below) the (010) plane is considerably larger than the distance to the oxygen atom below (above) the plane. When the crystal is cleaved, the longer VO bonds break, so that the cleavage plane may be thought of as consisting of the VOs pyramids with the shorter VO bonds. In the (010) cleavage plane (Fig. lb), the pyramids form zig-zag chains in which each linear stretch of the zig-zag consists of two pyramids sharing an edge, one with the oxygen atom above and the other with the oxygen atom below the plane (Fig. 1 c). 225 ' / t 1 / I t t/ Q 4 G c d Mg. i. Structure ovanadium oxide catalyst: (a) structure of Y205; (b) idealized structure of the (020) surface layer; (c) modes of the supercluster unit: two pyramids sharing an edge; (d) Lwo pyramids sharing a corner. The neighbouring chains are joined together by pairs of pyramids sharing a corner (Fig. ld). A (010) cleavage plane may serve as a model of the catalyst surface (19, 20]. As the interaction between dif%rent (010) planes is mediated by the elongated VO bonds, it is weaker than within the plane. Consequently, the interaction of the surface with the bulk of the catalyst crystal may be neglected in the first approximation. Standard meihods of quantum chemistry allow one to treat without excessive computational effort clusters consisting of: (i) a VOA pyramid with a small molecule (reactant) adsorbed on top of it [ 17, 22 ]; (ii) a pair of pyramidal units (sharing either a corner or an edge [ 18, 23, 24 ]); (iii) passibly three to six such units in the arrangement imitating the zig-zag chain or the chains' joint [24]. The calculations for a reasonably long chain, and a fortiori for a set of chains bound laterally to form a part of the crystal surface, would be prohibitively time consuming. 226 From that viewpoint, it seems attractive to attempt to extract the most vital information from quantum chemical calculations and subsequently to feed it into a simpler model which would allow the handling of a more extended part of the crystal surface, with the molecule adsorbed on it, treating the clusters (i) and (ii) as building blocks. Superclusters It would be most natural to envisage the crystal surface to which the adsorbed molecule is attached as an infinite plane filled, according to the structural data, with the clusters described above. Such an approach, although possible in principle, is impractical since the formally analogous problem of an impurity embedded in a molecular crystal [251 cannot be solved analytically and produces rather clumsy results. Moreover, it may not be physically necessary to include all the infinite plane in a model of the surface. In fact, one would intuitively assume that the adsorbed molecule is not likely to affect the very distant parts of the crystal. Consequently, a finite part of the surface may suffice to describe the most salient features of the interaction of the adsorbed molecule with the catalyst, provided that the size of the model fragment of the surface exceeds the range of the perturbation introduced by that extra molecule. As a single V05 unit (possibly with an adsorbed molecule) is in quantum chemical terminology called a cluster ([11, 181, vide supra), a finite set of such units, meant to imitate a part of the crystal surface, will be hereafter referred to as a supercluster. The relative orientation of the VO, units in the supercluster is assumed to be the same as in the (010) plane in the bulk of the crystal (Fig. 2). An attempt to deal with a model fragment consisting of a finite number of pyramidal units, artificially extricated from the crystal plane, produces the inevitable problem of boundary conditions. Strong chemical bonds left `dangling' at the boundaries of the supercluster would break the translational symmetry of the model and would be likely to mask similar effects due to an adsorbed molecule. In order to eliminate the artifacts due to the presence of boundaries, we impose periodic boundary conditions. In other words, we join the left edge of the supercluster with its right edge and the upper edge with the lower, so that the topology of the supercluster becomes equivalent to that of a torus. In the following, we will deal specifically with the case in which one electron is transferred in the chemisorption process from the adsorbed molecule onto an orbital of the adjacent V05 pyramid. As follows from quantum chemical cluster calculations (vide infra), the orbital involved derives from one of the d orbitals of the vanadium ion, triply or doubly degenerate in octahedral environment (for -rr or ar interactions, respectively). Due to the valence interaction between the V05 pyramids, this extra electron may in fact be delocalized over many such units. The specific task 227 z N, Fig. 2. Model superciuster with ra columns and m raves. of this paper is to estimate the degree of this delocalixatian, depending on the parameters of the crystal and of its interaction with the adsorbed molecule. Due to the d3 electronic configuration of the vanadium ions in the crystal, exactly the same approach will be valid if the electron is replaced by a hole, i.e. if the adsorbed molecule acts as an electron acceptor rather than donor. Model Hamiltonian It is readily seen from Fig. 2 that a convenient structural unit to build the surface of the crystal consists of two V05 pyramids sharing an edge, one with the oxygen atom above and the other with the oxygen atom below the plane containing the vanadium ion. As our treatment is at the best only semiquantitatively correct, we will simplify the model by considering only one orbital per VOA pyramid, meant to simulate a `representative' d orbital of vanadium. Then, the structural unit mentioned above will contribute two such orbitals. We assume that the electronic structure of one of the structural units is modified by a molecule adsorbed an top of it. Due to chemical bonds formed between the molecule and the surface atoms, the energies of the orbitals of this unit are different from those of other structural units of the 228 crystal. Depending on whether the molecule is attached to the vanadium ion of the `oxygen down' pyramid or to the oxygen ion of the `oxygen up' pyramid, either one or the other of the two orbitals of the structural unit is affected. The adsorbed molecule itself is not included in the model and its other effects on the crystal are neglected. To all intents of the present paper, vibrational degrees of freedom are irrelevant and are consistently disregarded. Let the model supercluster consist of mn structural units, of which one is modified in the manner described above, arranged in m `columns' and n `rows' (cf. Fig. 2). As has been mentioned above, we impose periodic boundary conditions in both directions. (Note that the corner-sharing pyramids of neighbouring rows either both have the oxygen atom above the square base or both have the oxygen atom below the base, so that n has to be even in order to guarantee that the states of the first and the last rows match in the same manner as they do for other rows.) Accordingly, our basis set will consist of 2mn orbitals. Two of them, hereafter referred to as IM; ), belong to the structural unit with the adsorbed molecule. We adopt the convention that i -1 for the orbital which is actually affected by the extra chemical bonds due to chemisorption. The remaining 2(rnn -1) orbitals are labelled as jUi ), where U identifies the structural unit to which the basis orbital belongs and i=1,2 labels the two orbitals available in each unit (corresponding to the two vanadium ions). For the sake of simplicity, we assume the basis functions to be normalized and orthogonal to each other. In the nearest neighbour approximation, the model Hamiltonian defined in this basis set has the following non-vanishing matrix elements: <M1IXIMI)=Emi <M21 \" IMO =E; <UiJ,'rJUB)=E ii=fr2)J <Ai j X 1Bx ) =Wx if the structural units A and B (A,B = U,M) belong to the adjacent columns of the same row of the supercluster; <A, I ee 1132) = <B2r X ~Al ) = V if the structural unit B is the right hand side nearest neighbour of the unit A in the same row of the supercluster; <A, j X IBI ) = Wz, if the row number of the structural unit A is odd and B is its nearest neighbour in the next row; <A21 X 1132) = Wy if the row number of the structural unit A is even and B is its nearest neighbour in the next row. All other matrix elements are set equal to zero. As can be checked by direct inspection, the above rules for constructing the matrix elements immediately follow from the structure of the model supercluster, shown in Fig. 2. E denotes the diagonal energy of an electron located at the orbital of one of the structural units, and EM is the corresponding diagonal energy of the orbital affected by the bonds with the adsorbed molecule. The other matrix elements describe: Wx - electron transfer via a corner shared by two units from the same row, 229 W, -electron transfer via a corner shared by two units from the same column, V -electron transfer via an edge shared by two units from the same row. In general, W,. 9L W, since the interaction between two pyramids sharing a corner is likely to be affected when the same corner is shared by a third pyramid (as is the case for units from the same row). Given the numerical values of the above parameters, for not too large superclusters the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized numerically, yielding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Their subsequent analysis will provide the sought conclusions concerning the localization or delocalization of the extra electron donated by the adsorbed molecule. Evaluation of input parameters As was mentioned earlier, our objective is to apply the results of clustertype quantum chemical calculations to estimate the parameters necessary for the supercluster model. Quantum chemical calculations performed for an individual V05 pyramid give the energy of the orbitals deriving from the triply (or doubly) degenerate d orbitals of octahedral vanadium. This value may be identified with the diagonal energy E of the supercluster model. Similar calculations performed for a cluster consisting of a V05 pyramid with the adsorbed molecule on top of it yield the corresponding orbital energy modified by the chemical interaction with the adsorbate, i.e. EM. The values of the transfer integrals Wb and V can be deduced from energy eigenvalues obtained for clusters consisting of two V05 moieties sharing a corner and an edge, respectively. In analogy to similar problems encountered in molecular crystal theory [26], the transfer integral may be identified with half the splitting of the pertinent orbitals of d parentage in the corresponding `dimer'. In general, W,__ is expected to be different from W,, due to the interaction with the third V05 pyramid sharing the same corner. Accordingly, a direct evaluation of W., would necessitate quantum chemical calculations to be done for a cluster of three V05 pyramids, which would involve a considerable computational effort. Such an effort is hardly warranted at this stage in view of the only qualitative accuracy expected of the supercluster approach in its present form. Instead, we will use two alternative parametrizations: (a) W,=W,, and (b) Wx = 0. The actual value of Wx is expected to be enclosed between these limits. For the quantum chemical calculations outlined above, we have chosen the semi-empirical SINDO method [27], which seems to offer a desirable compromise between rigour and numerical feasibility. SINDO is a semiempirical INDO-type method which has already proven to be capable of handling reasonably large transition metal-oxygen clusters, bare or with an adsorbed molecule [ 17, 22-24 ]. 230 In order to evaluate catalyst parameters necessary for the supercluster model, i.e. E, V, Wx and W, SINDO calculations have been performed for the following systems: V05H4: single vanadium-oxygen pyramid (C4v symmetry) with dangling bonds in the surface layer saturated by hydrogen atoms. The number of valence electrons taken into account in the calculations followed from the assumption that the constituent atoms should be electrically neutral (V(0), O(0), H(0), which yields NEL=39; V2O,sH4: two vanadium--oxygen pyramids joined by an edge (C2h symmetry) with surface oxygens saturated by hydrogens, NEL = 62; V209115: two vanadium-oxygen pyramids joined by a corner (C2 symmetry) with analogous hydrogen saturation scheme, NEL= 70. The geometries of the clusters under consideration were taken from experimental data ([ 191 and references therein), averaged to maintain the assumed symmetry. The examination of the dependence of the total energy on the assumed number of valence electrons confirmed the estimates of this latter number given above: for each cluster, the total energy reached its minimum just for the corresponding value of NEL listed above. Within this computational scheme, the highest occupied orbital for 'a single pyramid was the doubly degenerate MO deriving from the {d.,,, d,z} set of vanadium d orbitals (orbital energy equal to - 20.963 eV), occupied by 3 electrons. The calculated valence electron population on vanadium was close to 3e, in agreement with the previous tentative assumption. The appropriate orbital level splitting in respective `dimers' was estimated as AC' = El. - e$. = 0.6 eV for edge-sharing pyramids and De' ' = eA, - eB, = 0.4 eV for corner-sharing pyramids. To study the influence of the adsorbed species on the energy levels of the parent pyramid, SINDO computations were performed for the clusters composed of the V05H4 pyramid with an adatom or an admolecule (02,, NO, OH, CH37 O and H) attached to the vanadium ion in the vicinity of the missing sixth ligand. In the case of hydrogen atom, adsorption on the oxygen site of the cluster has also been studied. In each case crude optimisation of the adsorption distance has been undertaken, leading to an optimum value in the range 0.9-1.2 A. The degree of charge transfer between the adsorbed species and the V05H4 pyramid in each individual case is listed in Table 1, along with the position of the appropriate energy level. Inspection of Table 1 shows that only the oxygen atom and the OH group behave towards the vanadium oxide cluster as electron acceptors. 02 exhibits weak donor character, while CH3, NO and H atom donate to the cluster almost one electron. However, the shift of the appropriate energy level (that with increased or lowered occupancy) cannot be directly correlated with the degree of charge transfer. In the case of the NO molecule, the shift is the smallest although electron transfer is -large; the oxygen molecule causes moderate shift in spite of the small charge transfer, while the hydrogen atom causes 231 TABLE 1 Net charge (in e) transferred between the adsorbed species and the V05H4 pyramid, and the position of the accepting/donating cluster level, as obtained from molecular orbital calculations Msds AQM (e) (eV) - - - 20.963 CH3 - 0.9 -19.670 H (on O) - 0.7 - 21.880 H(on V) -0.8 -21.800 0Z -0.3 -21.473 NO - 0.7 - 21.261 OH + 0.3 -18.318' 0 +0.3 -18.591 'Hole level. the largest shift, with electron donation comparable to NO. The CH3 radical appears to be a special case, as its strong donor character is accompanied by the destabilization of the electron-accepting energy level and, as a consequence, delocalization of the extra electron over all the supercluster. Accordingly, for the CH3 case the finite supercluster model cannot be expected to yield physically meaningful conclusions. For electron acceptors, the adsorbate orbital character prevails in the degenerate energy level whose occupancy is increased with respect to the bare pyramid, whereas the orbital with lowered occupancy (and higher energy) is of vanadium oxide character. This case is best considered as the donation of a hole to this latter orbital, so that for actual supercluster calculations the value of the shift should be taken with reversed sign. It is readily seen that this shift has a relatively large absolute value which could be taken as an indication of strong hole localisation, results in this case, however, should be handled with great care. Results and discussion The values of the parameters obtained from quantum chemical cluster calculations have been used to define the supercluster Hamiltonian in the manner described above. The Hamiltonian has been diagonalized numerically to yield several lowest eigenstates of the extra electron in the supercluster (i.e. one local state and a few lowest pseudo-band states), the eigenvectors being represented as linear combinations of orbitals localized on individual pyramids. Final calculations were made for the supercluster composed of 9 columns and 10 rows, which required the diagonalization of a 180 X 180 matrix. The method has also been tested for larger supercluster dimensions. With 13 232 rows and 14 columns, the diagonalization of a 364 X 364 matrix was necessary. As all calculations have been done on an IBM PC/AT computer, this involved a rather large computational effort. Since the increase in cluster size did not affect the qualitative features of the results, we decided to confine the final calculations to reasonably smaller clusters. The results presented below refer to the case (a) above, i.e. W~=W&. Test calculations have also been done for case (b) (W,=0). The results were very similar and for this reason they are not discussed separately here. The main features of the results of the supercluster model are summarized in Table 2. For each chemisorbed molecule we have listed the electronic charge on the pyramid to which the molecule is directly attached (p,) and the charge on the second pyramid of the same unit (PZ)*. The eigenenergies of the three lowest supercluster states (with respect to the bottom of the pseudo-band of bare supercluster levels) are also included in Table 2 to show the adsorption-induced shift of the local level. It is readily seen that in the case of hydrogen adsorption, the electron transferred to the supercluster is localized, the lowest energy level being distinctly removed from the bottom of the band. The extra electron coming from the NO molecule tends to be rather delocalized in the vicinity of the adsorption centre, and the local level is much closer to the band. For OH and O, the localization of the hole turns out to be almost complete. For better visualization, the results are alternatively presented (in Figs. 3a, b for NO and H adsorption, respectively) in the form of the plots of electron distribution on two-pyramid building units along the row containing the impurity and along the two neighbouring rows**. Figs. 4a and 4b show the distribution of the extra electron over individual pyramids in the region TABLE 2 Charges on the two-pyramid supercluster building unit to which the adsorbed species is attached and the eigenenergies of the three lowest supercluster states (relative to the bottom of the bare supercluster pseudo-band) Mad.

The figures may be used to suggest the size and the shape of the cluster which would be optimal for the quantumchemical description of the specific interaction of the adsorbate with vanadium oxide surface. There are no data. at hand to provide an exhaustive test of the predictions of the supercluster model, nevertheless some comparison with quantum chemical calculations for extended clusters may be presented here. SINDO calculations for the NO molecule adsorbed on the cluster composed of four pyramids and for two hydrogens adsorbed symmetrically on a six-pyramid cluster are available in our laboratory [28]. Figure 5a, b shows the difference in the charge distribution between the cluster with adsorbed species and the bare cluster, following from molecular orbital calculations for the appropriate clusters. The charge on an individual pyramid is estimated as the sum of the charges of constituent atoms, with weights taking into account the fact that one atom may be shared by several adjacent pyramids. When substantial, the charges on some boundary atoms are also displayed in order to gauge the tendency to charge outflow from the model cluster. In view of the simplicity of the supercluster model, the agreement between the data shown in Figs. 4 and 5 may be considered surprisingly good. The qualitative picture of electron delocalization is very similar.

Difference in charge distribution between the cluster with the adsorbed species and the bare cluster, obtained from molecular orbital calculations (data extracted from the results of [25] for appropriate clusters): (a) NO adsorption, (b) H adsorption. ever a pyramid with substantial charge predicted by the supercluster model is missing in the model used for the SINDO calculations, the boundary oxygen bears a significantly increased charge. Conclusions The results presented above suggest that the validity of the cluster approach used previously in the quantum chemical description of catalytic activity [ 17, 18, 22-24 ] depends on the strength of the chemical interaction of the reactant molecule with the catalyst, as compared with the strength of the interaction between the structural units forming the catalyst crystal. If the molecule-catalyst interaction is strong and the electron-accepting orbital of the VO6 cluster is substantially lowered with respect to its energy in the absence of the reactant molecule, the electronic structure of the catalyst crystal is perturbed only locally. The perturbation does not practically extend beyond the V05 units adjacent to that directly affected, and even there it is marginal. In that case, the results of quantum chemical calculations performed for a cluster consisting of a single V05 pyramid and the chemisorbed molecule are likely to yield valid conclusions, since the rest of the catalyst crystal may be safely ignored. 235 If, on the other hand, the adsorbed molecule only slightly stabilizes the electron-accepting orbital of the V05 cluster, the range of the perturbation induced by the electron donated to the catalyst crystal may be larger. In that case, quantum chemical calculations should be done for a more extended cluster, consisting of the adsorbed molecule and several V05 pyramids. Once such calculations have been carried out for the clusters (i) and (ii) described earlier, the supercluster model allows one to estimate (with very small computational effort) the approximate number of V05 units necessary to obtain meaningful results, as well as the positions of the neighbouring units that are likely to participate substantially and should be included in the calculations. If the electron-accepting orbital of the V05 unit directly involved in chemisorption is destabilized by the reactant molecule, the extra electron spreads over all the catalyst surface. In that case the representation of the surface by its finite fragment is essentially invalid. Strictly speaking, this renders the cluster approach used normally in quantum chemical calculations inapplicable. However, the `electron sink' effect of the surface as a whole might be imitated in quantum chemical calculations by changing the net charge on the part of the model cluster which represents the catalyst crystal. This approach was adopted by Szczepanek [23[ in his calculations on CH3 sorption. The CH3 radical tends to donate one electron to the catalyst crystal. Therefore, an extra charge infinitesimally smaller than + 1, located on the V05 pyramid which was used as the model of the surface, might reasonably mimic the electron-absorbing effect of the rest of the crystal. In fact, the net charge of + 1 was used [231. The model proposed in this paper can be easily generalized to incorporate in the supercluster more than one adsorbing centre. This will allow working out in more detail the hypothesis [3, 61 on the possible role of the catalyst as a bridge to transfer the electrons from one reactant to the other. Such studies will be undertaken in the near future.
