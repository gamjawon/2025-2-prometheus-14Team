PALCZEWSKA*, A. JABLONSKI, Z. KASZKUR Department of Catalysis by Metals, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 01-224 Warsaw (Poland) G. ZUBA and J. WERNISCH Institut fur Angewandte und Technische Physik, Technische Universitat Wien, Vienna (Austria) Summary The characterization of palladium-lead on calcium carbonate catalysts has been carried out. Although widely utilized in laboratory and industrial syntheses, as e.g. the Lindlar catalyst, they are not sufficiently understood. Hydrogen sorption studies by catalysts of this type, their X-ray and XPS characteristics, and the results of kinetic tests as catalysts in the semihydro- genation of acetylene indicated the nature of the metallic component of the Lindlar catalyst as palladium crystallites partially covered with a dispersed lead oxide deposit. The second catalyst characterized was a Pd Pb alloy supported on CaCOa system, and was identified as a PdaPb intermetallic compound. Its selectivity, higher than that of the commercial Lindlar cata- lyst, was attributed to the ordered structure of the Pd Pb alloy. Introduction Catalytic semihydrogenation of carbon-carbon triple bonds may result in the formation of the respective cis double bond. Under proper conditions the reaction can be carried out selectively, even in the presence of other easily reducible groups in the same molecule or in other components of the reaction mixture. Palladium is the best known metal catalyst which is frequently used in industrial and laboratory practice, but its remarkable bond- and stereo-selectivity can be further improved by modification with certain metallic additives [1,2]. Among these modified catalysts, palladium-lead on calcium carbonate is particularly successful in selective hydrogenation of the acetylenic bond *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 308 [1 - 4]. Although this so-called Lindlar catalyst is widely utilized in numer- ous organic syntheses, the nature of the catalyst itself seems not to be suf- ficiently understood. The expressions often applied, e.g. palladium 'lead-poisoned' [1, 4], 'inactivated or 'treated' with lead acetate' [5, 6], 'alloyed with lead' [7] etc. indicate a lack of sufficient information and clear hypotheses on the Lindlar Pd Pb catalytic system. Its characterization by several routine methods has been undertaken in the present study. Experimental Catalysts Catalyst A: The commercial Lindlar catalyst (manufactured by Merck- Schuchardt, Munich); Pd loading 5 wt.%, at ratio Pd/Pb = 3.3. Catalyst B: The Lindlar catalyst on freshly precipitated CaCOa [3,8]; Pd loading 2 wt.%, at ratio Pd/Pb =3.5. Catalyst C: The palladium/lead alloy on CaCOa catalyst (manufactured by Chemipan, Warsaw); Pd loading 2 wt.%, at ratio Pd/Pb = 3.5. Chemical analyses: Palladium and lead concentrations were determined after dissolution in 1 M ammonia buffer by the pulse polarography method (Pulse Polarograph Type PP-04, Unitra Telpod, Cracow) [9]. The results were compared with those obtained by colorimetric methods. Sorption of hydrogen by the catalysts Hydrogen sorption was studied by the static volumetric method in a conventional all-glass apparatus at constant ambient temperature. The Barocel Electronic Manometer (Model 1174, Datametrics, Inc.) was used for pressure measurements of the adsorptive up to ~ 30 torr (1 ton- = 133,322 Pa). Hydrogen was produced electrolytically from an aqueous KOH solu- tion, then dried in a liquid nitrogen trap and finally purified by passage through a hot palladium-silver thimble. X-ray characterization of the catalysts X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with Cu K.a Ni-filtered radia- tion from a source operated at 30 kV and 12 mA (Rigaku-Denki Geigerflex D-9C). Examination of the diffraction spectra allowed identification of metal components of the catalysts and estimation of their average crystallite sizes by means of the X-ray line broadening method (Scherrer method). XPS analysis of the catalysts The XPS experiments were run in a XSAM 800 Multitechnique Surface Analysis System (Kratos Ltd.). The catalysts were mounted on double-faced tape at an angle normal to the analyzer axis. The sample surface was irra- diated with the beam of Al Ko, X-rays at about 70 to the surface normal. 309 The energy positions of the peaks in the spectra were calibrated with respect to the energy of the Ca 2p3/2 photoelectron from CaC03. According to [10], the binding energy of such photoelectrons is equal to 346.8 eV. The total energy shift due to charge and the work function was found to be about 7.5 eV. The calibration can also be made with respect to the C Is peak from CaC03 (binding energy 289.3 eV [10]). The energy positions resulting from both calibrations are practically the same. The quantitative analysis was performed using the method without standards developed by Ebel and coworkers [11,12]. The accuracy of this method for several alloys was found to be within 2 wt.% [11]. In the present work, the most prominent peaks were chosen for analysis, i.e. Pd 3ds/2 and Pb 4:t-,/^. The peak areas were calculated as the products of the peak height and the peak width at half the height [10]. The energy separa- tion of the Pd 3d5/2 peak and the Ca 2p3/2 peak is 11.4 eV. Thus, the inten- sity of the Pd 3d5/2 peak is increased in the vicinity of the Ca 2p3/2 peak due to the high energy satellites in the Al K^ radiation. The contribution from the Ca 2p3/2 peak was estimated experimentally. The Pd 3ds/2 peak and the high energy satellite were recorded on pure palladium. The energy separation was found to be 10.6 eV and the ratio of intensities was equal to 1/12 (8.3%). Thus, in the course of the quantitative analysis the intensity of the Pd 3ds/2 peak was corrected by subtracting 1/12 of the intensity of the Ca 2p3/2 photoelectron line. Kinetic tests A typical all-glass static microcatalytic reactor was used with a circulat- ing gaseous reaction mixture. The reactor was coupled to a gas chromato- graph (Chromathron Gas Chromatograph GCHF 18.3) fitted with a flame ionization detector. Analyses of the hydrocarbon reaction mixtures were made using a 4 mm X 1 m column (temp. 60 C) packed with Kieselgel 60 (Merck) in the case of mixtures and a 3 mm X 6 m column (temp. 0 C) packed with 10% EDO-1 on 100/200 Chromosorb P AW (Supeico, Inc.) in the case of mixtures. A small amount of catalyst was spread on a piece of porous glass placed at the bottom of the reactor tube. After evacuation of the reactor system the catalyst sample was reduced with hydrogen at room temperature for 15 min. The separate TPR (temperature-programmed reduction) experiment (e.g. [13]) gave evidence that all Pd Pb on CaC03 catalysts were reduced under these conditions. The reaction mixture with known composition was intro- duced into the previously evacuated reactor system. Two hydrogenation reactions were chosen to compare activities and selectivities of the catalytic systems studied: (a) selective semihydrogenation of an acetylene admixture in ethylene and (b) semihydrogenation (bond- and stereoselective) of 2- butyne vapour. Acetylene and ethylene (C.P.) were manufactured by Matheson; 2- butyne (Fluka, purum) was freshly distilled before each set of experiments. 310 Results Hydrogen sorption isotherms The hydrogen sorption-desorption isotherms are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When considering the isotherm representative for the commercial Lindlar catalyst A (and for the Lindlar catalyst B as well) (Fig. 1) or for the highly dispersed catalyst C (Fig. 2), a distinct difference can be seen in the behav- iour of these two types of catalysts. The Lindlar catalysts not only adsorb but also absorb hydrogen and transform into the ^-hydride with the hyster- esis loop typical for palladium itself, with a similar H/Pd value of 0.6. The Lindlar catalyst, heat treated at 523 K, still behaves qualitatively in the same way, but the j3-hydride formation starts at lower PH and the H/Pd value for the hydride phase is about 0.4. The hydrogen sorption-desorption isotherms in the case of the catalyst C are smooth and do not exhibit any phase trans- formation of the metal component into the hydride phase. X-ray measurements The X-ray diffraction spectra of the Pd Pb on CaCOa catalysts were particularly difficult for detailed interpretation, because the strong and numerous peaks of the support itself coincide with the weak and broad H/Pd 0.2 O.I. 0.6 H/Pd Pig. 1.

However, some peaks of Pd were identified in the diffraction pattern of the Lindlar catalyst A. The peaks of Pb, of its oxides or salts (such as acetate, carbonate) could not be distinguished. Examination of the X-ray diffraction pattern of the catalyst C revealed an apparent shift of the palladium(lll) peak (the only one visible) toward lower 6 values, which must be interpreted as an increase in the lattice parameter due to the dissolution of lead in palladium. The roughly estimated lattice parameter of the alloy has the value of about 4.01 A, which is in keeping with the value 4.013 A characteristic of the Pd3Pb intermetallic compound as reported in [17]; or 4.0216 A according to [19]. After briefly heating of sample C in hydrogen at 523 K and degassing, a whole series of sharp peaks appeared. They could be attributed to the inter- metallic compound Pd3?b present in the catalyst sample. The most intense among those peaks of the respective superstructure, which are absent in the X-ray patterns of the disordered Pd Pb alloys, was distinctly recorded [the (210) reflection]. The evaluated lattice parameters of the metallic component of the cata- lysts studied are collected in Table 1, together with the suggested interpreta- tion of the data. The estimated values of mean crystallite size of the metallic component of the catalysts A, B and C were included in the Table.

The Pd 3d and Pb 4f doublets are shown in Fig. 4a, b. The energy posi- tions of the Pd 3d5/2 and Pb 417/2 peaks are listed in Table 2. For compari- son, the binding energies of these core levels for pure metals and oxides were used [10]. The energy position of the palladium peak agrees well with the posi- tions recorded for pure metal. On the other hand, the position of the Pb 4f7/2 peak for the Lindlar catalysts A and B indicates the presence of lead oxides at the surface. The results of the quantitative analyses are listed in Table 3. The calculations of the surface composition were performed for different thick- nesses of the contamination overlay er on the catalyst surface. The thick- nesses d are expressed in terms of the ratio to the inelastic mean free path of an electron in the overlay er material at energy 1000 eV [X (ref.)]. One can see that the presence of the contamination overlayer has practically no effect on the calculated concentrations. This is due to the fact that the kinetic 313 TABLE 2 Binding energies of Pd Sd^/^ and Pb ^i-i/^ core levels determined for investigated samples Sample Binding energy (eV) Pd 3ds/2 Pb 4f^ Lindlar catalyst A Lindlar catalyst B Pd Pb on CaCC 3 catalyst C 335.4 336.6 335.4 138.6 138.6 136.8 TABLE 3 The surface composition (cp^, cpb) of the catalysts investigated by the XPS method Catalyst Rel. thickness of overlayerd/X (ref.)

Tests of activity and selectivity of the catalytic systems The kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of excess ethylene is illustrated in Fig. 5. The figure is characteristic of a typical ex- perimental run for all three kinds of catalysts studied. The change in com- position of the reaction mixture with time is similar to that described and discussed by McGown et al. [14]. The variation in the composition of gas phase hydrocarbons with time shows four distinct stages, as previously reported by McGown et al. [14]. The second stage, represented by the linear disappearance of acetylene, lasts until about 95% of the total C^ conversion. Within that region, the sequence of rates of the total C2H2 conversion is as follows (relative to the same mass of Pd in the catalyst sample): 314 20 40 60 80 100 f[min] Fig. 5.

Pd \\ - C~>_ A 'C,H, ^ -CaH, ^ 'C,H, where (Pd) denotes the Pd (without Pb) catalyst precipitated on the CaC03 support, as in the Lindlar method [3,8]. The ratio of selectivities toward ethylene formation [14] is S/JSc =1/2. The concentration of ethylene increased during the second stage of the C^H-i hydrogenation. When the conversion of C-fl-i was above 95%, the rate of C^ti^ appearance rapidly increased and the concentration of C2H4 de- creased. Nevertheless, in the case of catalyst C at 0.05 mol% C-fl^ in the hydrocarbon mixture there was 0.4 mol% of CzHg while in the case of the catalyst A a level of 0.3 mol% C^H^ had already produced 0.6 mol% C^PL,. Discussion Characteristics of the Pd Pb on CaCO^ catalysts. The Lindlar catalysts prepared by methods generally used [3, 8] are not Pd Pb alloys, as they have often been termed. The isotherm of hydro- gen sorption (Fig. 1) alone provides evidence supporting this statement. The Pd Pb alloy with such a high lead content cannot be transformed into its /3-hydride phase at room temperature [15]. However, the presence of a very low concentration of lead in the palladium phase cannot be totally excluded. The X-ray pattern supports these conclusions and provides a still more important suggestion. The lead should form a finely dispersed phase in the metallic component of the Pd Pb Lindlar catalyst and/or be present mostly on the surface of the palladium crystallites. This would explain the observed absence of the peaks due to lead in the diffraction pattern. 315 The XPS results support such a model of the catalyst grain. The surface composition of the Lindlar catalysts A and B is represented by the values of the atomic ratio Pd/Pb = 1.4 to 1.5 (A) or 1.3 to 1.4 (B), instead of 3.3 or 3.5 respectively for the average composition of the metallic grains of the catalysts. These high values of surface enrichment in lead could be explained by thermodynamic reasons [16], but alternatively, one can assume that the method of preparation of Lindlar catalysts may be responsible for the pres- ence of the lead precipitated on and/or next to the crystallites of palladium. The depth of the quantitative analysis corresponding to kinetic energy of the photoelectrons used is equal to about 1.5 nm, i.e. about four mono- layers. Thus, the determined concentrations are the values averaged over such thickness. It is possible that the Lindlar catalyst contains even more lead in the overlayer. The chemical shift of the lead line in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b) proves that the lead in the Lindlar catalyst is oxidized. Apparently it will be re- duced to metal in the hydrogenating medium of a future reaction mixture. The Pd Pb on CaC03 catalyst C is, on the contrary, a lead alloy: the shape of the hydrogen isotherm (Fig. 2), the value of the lattice parameter and the qualitative character of the XPS spectrum give support to such a conclusion. This alloy can be interpreted as the intermetallic compound PdaPb, highly dispersed when freshly prepared, but easily forming large and well ordered crystallites after a short heat pretreatment at 523 K. The quantitative XPS analysis shows that the atomic ratio Pd/Pb at the surface varies from 2 to 2.3. Thus the surface enrichment in lead is less than for the Lindlar catalyst. The LEED-AES investigations performed on Pd single crystal faces covered with a Pb adiayer [18] led to the following interpretation of the very stable surface structures observed: all three low-index Pd crystal faces, when covered with lead within certain quantitative limits, may form an over- layer of the ordered Pd Pb alloy still enriched in lead at its surface. The atomic ratio Pd/Pb in that surface layer should be just equal to 2 for the mixture of equal parts of the three low-index Pd crystal faces, precovered with lead. The surface of the intermetallic compound may oxidize with more difficulty than the surface of a random alloy, small lead crystallites or clusters. Therefore the chemical shift of the lead line was not observed in Fig. 4b. Activity and selectivity of the Pd Pb on CaCOy catalysts The Lindlar catalyst, i.e. supported palladium covered with finely dis- persed lead, is less bond- and stereo-selective in the semihydrogenation of the acetylenic bond than the Pd Pb catalyst of the same average composi- tion but transformed into the stable, bulk-ordered PdaPb alloy. It can be expected that the uniform distribution of active sites, i.e. the fixed geometry of localization of lead atoms 'tailoring' the two-dimensional oligoatomic clusters of palladium, may explain the high selectivity of the catalyst C. 316 Acknowledgements We are indebted to Dr. J.

Its selectivity, higher than that of the commercial Lindlar catalyst, was attributed to the ordered structure of the Pd-Pb alloy. References 1 E.M. Marvell Th. Li Synthesis 1973 457 2 P.N.

Although widely utilized in laboratory and industrial syntheses, as e.g. the Lindlar catalyst, they are not sufficiently understood. Hydrogen sorption studies by catalysts of this type, their X-ray and XPS characteristics, and the results of kinetic tests as catalysts in the semihydrogenation of acetylene indicated the nature of the metallic component of the Lindlar catalyst as palladium crystallites partially covered with a dispersed lead oxide deposit.
