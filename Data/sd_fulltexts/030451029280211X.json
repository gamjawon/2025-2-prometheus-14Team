Guimon Laboratoire de Physicochimie Moleculaire, URA CNRS 474, Avenue de l'Universite, 64000 Pau (France) (Received January 2, 1991; revised July 1, 1992) Abstract Multifunctional copper chromite catalysts doped with barium and dispersed on a graphite support were used in the synthesis of dimethyldodecylamine and/or rnethylaidodecylamine from lauronitrile, ammonia, hydrogen and methanol. The reaction was carried out at 5 MPa and 250 C. From XPS characterization of the catalysts, we observed that the promoter and the preparation method have an important effect on the surface composition and on the catalytic properties. Zero-valent copper increases the selectivity to tridodecylamine, which could be formed via a transallcylation reaction of the didodecylamine. On the other hand, the surface formation of a BaaCussCry04 phase (resulting from the insertion of barium in the CuCr02 phase) significantly increases the selectivity to dimethyldodecylamine. Introduction This paper is a part of an investigation of a continuous process for the selective preparation of secondary or tertiary asymmetric fatty amines from fatty acids, fatty esters or nitriles, hydrogen and ammonia, in the presence of solid copper or nickel based catalysts [ 1, 2 ]. Catalytically, a process like this one requires the formulation of multifunctional catalysts which at a first approximation present a hydro-dehydrogenating function and an appropriate acidic-basic function for the reactants used or the intermediates formed (imines, amines). Some of the main steps of the mechanisms have already been proposed by von Braun et al. [3], Greenfield [4[ and Volf and Pasek [5J. However, the correlations between mass and surface compositions and the selectivity are more difficult to establish. In the case of catalysts belonging to the copper chromite family, the variations of the hydrogenating properties due to the composition (Cu/Cr) and the nature of the phases have been established [6, 7]. However, the modifications of the resulting acidity (number, 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 322 nature, strength of acid sites) [ 7 ] and the influence of certain promoters on the selectivity and on the stability [2] have been investigated less extensively, yet they are important parameters in amination reactions. as are the effects of certain reactants or products such as ammonia or water. Baiker and K~enski showed, for instance, that part of the copper was transformed into copper nitride during the amination of alcohols [8]. We have also observed recently that the adsorption properties of supported copper-chromium catalysts could be strongly inhibited by the presence of water or ammonia [7]. Moreover, the degree of inhibition depends on the composition of the base catalyst (Cu + Cr, Cu /Cr) and on the nature of the support and the promoter. In order to better understand the role of each component of a catalyst used in amination reactions we investigated the CuCr(Ba) systems supported on graphite, prepared in various ways. The surface composition of these solids and the nature of the phases present were determined by XPS. Then these solids were used for the direct conversion of lauronitrile (model molecule) in the presence of methanol and hydrogen so as to obtain selectively one of the following reactions: -2H20 CI IH2sCN + 2CH30H + 2H2 - C12H25NHCH3 -> C12H25N(CH3)2 2C11H23CN+CH30H+4H2--~H3) (C,2H25)2NH-~2 . (C12H25)2NCH3 Lastly, we propose an interpretation of the catalytic results obtained as a function of the main physico-chemical characteristics. Experimental The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of graphite using aqueous and acid solutions of precursors or by co-precipitation of the hydroxides in the presence of the support. The support employed was a graphite LONZA (HSAG 300) with a surface area of about 300 m2 g-1. The solids thus obtained were oven-dried at 120 C for 12 h and then heated at 350 C under an inert-gas flow for 8 h (see Table 1 for the composition and method of preparation of the solids investigated). The catalytic reaction was carried out in a continuous fixed-bed reactor at a pressure of between 3 and 8 MPa, T= 250 C, RCN/MeOH/H2 =1/10/ 50, nitrile flow= 10-2 mol h-1, catalyst weight= 1 g. The XPS analyses were performed with a SSI model 301 spectrometer using focused (diameter of the irradiated area: 600 Am), monochromatized AlKa radiation (10 kV, 12 mA) and coupled with a glove-box. The residual pressure inside the analysis chamber was about 5 X 10-$ Pa. The sample charging effect was minimized with a low-energy flood gun (5 eV). Calibration of the spectra was done with the Cls line (284.2 eV) from the graphite. The XPS peaks were decomposed into subcomponents using a Gaussian (80%)-Lorentzian (200) curve-fitting program with a nonlinear (Shirley) background. These curves are symmetrical except for the Cr2p3/2 lines TABLE i Composition and method of preparation of copper-chromium-barium/graphite catalysts Catalyst/graphite Cu Cr Ba Cu/CrBa Preparation method (wt.%) (wt.%) (wt.%o) (atomic ratio) BaCr04 - 6.8 17.6 Cr/Ba=1 impregnation of BaCr04 BaCr04 +Cu0 3.9 4 10.4 Cu/Cr/Ba=1/1.2/1.2 impregnation of BaCr04 and copper nitrate; thermal treatment at 350 C CuCr 5.9 4.1 - Cu/Cr=1/0.8 co-precipitation of (Cu, Cr) hydroxides CuCr Ba doped 5.5 4.2 1.7 Cu/Cr/Ba= 1/1/0.15 impregnation of barium nitrate 5.8 5 5 Cu/Cr/Ba=1/1/0.4 CuCrBa 5.8 5 1.2 Cu/Cr/Ba=1/1/0.1 co-precipitation of (Cu, Cr, Ba) hydroxides w w 324 (asymmetry factor: 0.2). The quantitative analyses were performed using the sensibility factors given by Scofield. The transmission (T) of the spectrometer and the electron mean free path (7) are related via 7-I'=Ec -', where E, is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Results XPS measurements BaCr04 /graphite The surface atomic ratios (Ba/C = 0.03, Cr/C = 0.022) show that the surface concentrations of Ba and Cr are far smaller than the bulk concentrations and that the atomic ratio Ba/Cr at the surface is greater than that for the whole of the solid (Ba/Cr=1). Moreover, the Cr2p3/2 photopeaks show that over half of the surface chromium is in the form of Cr(III), resulting from the reduction of barium chromate into barium chromite favoured by the graphite support. (At the same time, there is formation of BaO, which could explain the relative superficial enrichment in barium.) CuCrBa /graphite Effect of the presence of barium on the dispersion of copper arid of chromium (Table 2). The presence of barium decreases the number of copper or of chromium atoms at the surface. From the relative intensity of the copper XPS signal it can be seen that the dispersion of copper varies with the barium content or with the method of addition of this element. This result was corroborated by dispersion values obtained from N20 decomposition on the same catalysts [ 10 ] . Description of Cu2p312 photopeaks. Efect of barium (Table 3). Depending on the method with which copper, chromium and barium are associated, the addition of barium has two discrete results: - With a CuCr/graphite catalyst, the addition of barium appreciably increases the Cu(I) content. - For CuCrBa/graphite (Fig. 1) or CuO+BaCr04/graphite solids, the presence of barium results in a decrease in the Isp/Ipp ratio compared with TABLE 2 Surface atomic ratios (Cu/C, Cr/C, Cu/Cr, Ba/Cr) of graphite-supported catalysts Catalyst Cu/C Cr/C Cu/Cr Ba/Cr Atomic ratio Cu/Cr/Ba (not reduced) (elemental analysis) CuCr 0.087 0.07 1.26 - Cu/Cr= 1/0.8 CuCr doped with Ba 0.051 0.04 1.29 0.13 Cu/Cr/Ba= 1/1/0.4 CuCrBa 0.033 0.044 0.74 0.11 Cu/Cr/Ba= 1/1/0.1 CuO+BaCr0, 0.027 0.021 1.3 0.72 Cu/Cr/Ba=1/1.2/1.2 325 TABLE 3 Characteristics of Cu2p3/2 photopeaks: effect of barium on (Cu-Cr)/graphite catalysts Catalyst Binding energy (eV) _Isp Cu(1) Kinetic energy' (ev) Ipp total Cu Cu(II) Cu(1) (%) CuCr 934.3 932.1 0.7 45 916.2 - Cu(1) CuCr doped with Ba 934.1 931.8 0.82 72 917.1- Cu(l) CuCrBa 934 931.8 0.64 46 916.6-Cu(I) CuO+BaCr09 934.1 932 0.5 56 916.7-Cu(I) 'Cu Auger. arbitrary units CU(11) IJ i Cu(11) (shake-up) 946.6 942.6 938.6 934.6 930.6 926.6 Binding energy (eV) Fig. 1.

Effect of barium CTable 4). In the presence of barium, Cr(VI) species can be observed only on a Cu0 + BaCr04/ graphite catalyst (Fig. 2(a)). Moreover, two Cr(III) species can be observed on this catalyst. As quoted in Experimental, the Cr2p3/2 peaks are supposedly asymmetrical (factor 0.2) due to multiplet splitting [111. The FWHM of Cr2p' of Cr203 is much larger than that of Cr(VI) [ 12 ]. It can be considered as previously indicated that the graphite support favours the reduction of barium chromate into barium chromite or into Cr203: 2BaCr04 + 3H2 --> BaCr204 + Ba0 + 3H20 and 2Bacr04 + 31-12 -- Cr203 + 213a0 + 3H20 The Ba-doped CuCr/graphite solid contains only Cr(III) species (575.7 eV) that, after studying the BaCr04/SUPPOrt solid, are attributed to barium 326 TABLE 4 Surface atomic ratios Cr(III)/total Cr and Cr(VI)/total Cr Catalyst Cr(III) Cr(VI) total Cr (\") total Cr M Binding energies (eV), Cr2p3/2 575.7 576.6 578.2 579.5 CuCr - 66 34 - CuCr doped with Ba 100 - - - CuCrBa - 100 - - Cu0 + BaCr04 19 61 - 20 arhitrary units Cr(III) Cr(VI) 581.88 579.88 57 ~.88 57S.88 573.88 571.88 (a) Binding energy (eV) arbitrarg units Cr(IIII 581.6 SZ9.6 577.6 55.6 573.6 ST1.6 (b) Binding energy (eV) Fig. 2.

Description of Ba3d` photopeaks. The binding energy of the Ba3d5/2 photoelectron is typical of a Ba2+ ion representative of an oxide (Ba0) or a chromite (BaCr204). Modification of catalysts during the reduction or the reaction. The amine synthesis being carried out in a micropilot under pressure, it was not possible to remove the catalyst without exposure to air, and solids were not characterized by XPS after use. Nevertheless, the superficial composition of some solids after reduction with hydrogen has been briefly examined; this work is in progress [10, 14]. Concerning, for example, the BaCr04+CUO/ graphite catalyst, we observed that the major part of the copper oxides is transformed into metallic copper during the Hz reduction or during the first part of the reaction. On the other hand, for Cu-Cr/graphite catalysts, the reduction of Cr(VI) species or of Cu(II) or Cu(I) species is greatly dependent on the barium content. Without barium the copper species (Cu(II) or Cu(I)) are mostly transformed into zero-valent copper, but only a small portion of Cr(VI) species is reduced to Cr(III). When barium was added to such catalysts the reduction rate of the precursors was significantly decreased. Moreover, the catalytic results presented in the next part show that the catalytic properties are related more to the composition of the precursor than to that of the reduced catalyst. Catalytic results Reactivity of lauronitrile From the results presented in Table 5, the main conclusions are the following: (1) The catalysts prepared from BaCr04 are the least active. (2) After addition of CuO to BaCr04 the activity increases substantially. Moreover, tridodecylamine (R,N) is the major product (50 to 60%). This is certainly due to a significant formation of metallic copper during the reaction. Indeed, we have shown that the selectivity for tertiary amine depended directly on the surface concentration in totally reduced copper [ 11 ]. Besides the tertiary amine, essentially didodecylamine (R2NH) and methyldidodecylamine (R2NCH3) are obtained, which shows very well that the substitution reactions of the fatty chain are strongly favoured over methylation by methanol. (3) For the copper-chromium catalysts, it can be observed on the contrary that dimethy1dodecylamine (RN(CH3)2) and methyldidodecylamine (R2NCH3) are the main products. (4) The impregnation with 5% Ba on the CuCr/graphite catalyst inhibits the activity (the nitrile conversion is 5 Yo instead of 90% after 5 h reaction). This would be the consequence of the surface-phase formation of CU20 and BaCr204. Addition of a small quantity of barium modifies only slightly the TABLE 5 00 Reaction of lauronitrile in the presence of methanol and hydrogen' Catalyst /graphite Reaction Conversion Selectivity (%) time RCN (h) (4 '0) RNHMe RNMez RZNH RZNMe R3N others BaCr04 5 < 5 12 35 7 10 5 30 (Ba=17.6, Cr=6.8) BaCr04 +Cu0 5 85 - 2 32 7 55 4 (Ba=10.4, Cr=4.0, Cu=3.9) 25 98 - 2 25 25 46 2 CuCr 5 90 2 58 2 30 8 - (Cu=5.9, Cr=4.1) 25 95 13 42 7 22 13 - CuCr+Ba 5 90 1 40 2 45 11 - (Cu=5.5, Cr=4.2, Ba=1.7) 20 95 3 35 3 45 11 - CuCrBa 5 80 - 85 - 12 2 - (Cu=5.8, Cr=5.0, Ba=1.2) 25 90 - 66 - 30 3 - 'Reaction conditions: p = 5.0 MPa, T= 250 C, m=1 g, RCN/CH30H/Hz =1/10/50, TCRCN= 1 h. 329 properties of the starting solid. Nevertheless, a greater selectivity for methyldidodecylamine can be observed. However, when an equivalent system is prepared by simultaneous coprecipitation of the hydroxides, the selectivity is once again strongly modified. Indeed, at the start of the reaction, 95% dimethyldodecyIamine at 75% conversion of lauronitrile is obtained. This selectivity decreases until it stabilizes at 65%, the main secondary product being methyldidodecylamine (30%). It must also be pointed out that the selectivity for tertiary amine (R3N) is very much diminished (3%) compared with that obtained in the preceding examples. Compared to the CuCr/graphite system, the addition of Ba substantially increases the N-methylation of dodecylamine and inhibits the formation of didodecylannine and tridodecylamine. Surface characterizations have shown that these catalysts have a CuCr02 type phase and that barium can stabilize this phase. However, it cannot be shown that welldefined entities are formed with copper and/or chromium as in previous cases. These results show that the nature of the catalytic precursor has a determining effect on the selectivity. This fact was confirmed by an experiment in which the Cu-Cr/graphite catalyst, previously used without reduction, was reduced with hydrogen at 350 C for 12 h before the reaction. The selectivity was very different (Table 6), didodecylamine and especially tridodecylamine (60%) being the main products after 25 h of reaction. Finally, there was a constant increase in the R3N selectivity with time on stream on pre-reduced catalysts, while there was no variation with unreduced solids. Reactivity of didodecylamine on a Cu 5.9-Cr 4.1 /graphite catalyst. Effect of a reduction treatment The methylation of didodecylamine with methanol was carried out under the same experimental conditions as previously described, and results axe presented in Table 7.

It is clear that methylation reactions leading to methyldodecylamine, dimethyldodecylamine and methyldidodecylamine are predominant on the unreduced catalyst, while tridodecylamine is the main product on the prereduced solid. In this case the activity is also decreased. From such selectivities one can deduce that: - in the presence of the unreduced catalyst, besides the methylation of didodecylamine (step (1)) there is the formation of tridodecylamine and dodecylamine via a transalkylation of didodecylamine (step (2)). The primary amine reacts further with methanol and produces monomethyldodecylamine and dimethy1dodecylamine (step (3)).

(i) Transformation of didodecylamine via steps (1) and (2). The dodecylamine formed from step (2) would react with the secondary amine (RZNH) and form tridodecylamine via step (4): - H2 (RCH2)2NH RCH2NH2 RCH=NH .-(RCHAN (4) Such a reaction could explain the significant formation of the tertiary amine.

Conclusion We show in this paper that barium has a significant effect on the catalytic properties of a CuCr/graphite system. However, various phases appear, depending on the method employed for the introduction of barium. (1) On solid BaCr04 deposited on graphite, the presence of particular Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species has been shown. It seems that a fraction of the Cr(VI) species is reduced to two Cr(III) species by graphite. These solids are inactive for amine synthesis. (2) For impregnation of barium on the preformed Cu-Cr system, the surface formation of CU20 (72% instead of 43% without Ba) and BaCr204 is favoured. This gives the solid methylating activity, but equivalent amounts of RZNMe and RNMe2 and a non-negligible amount of tertiary amine R3N can be observed. The latter is favoured by the presence of a metallic copper, for we believe that this tertiary amine is the result of a transalkylation reaction of the secondary amine. (C1zH2s)2NH C11H23CH-N-(C1zH25) (C12H25)2NH H NH(C121125) (C12H25)3N + C1zH25NH2 r- C11HzsCH~ N(C12H25)2 (3) For co-precipitation of the hydroxides of copper, of chromium and of barium, the solids obtained have on their surface the CuCr02 and Ba0 phases, part of the barium interacting perhaps with the CUCr02 phase, but on this point more precise information is lacking (identical phases have been observed with the system not promoted with barium). Initially these catalysts are particularly efficient, since they axe very selective for dimethyldodecylamine (95O). After stabilization the latter drops down to 60% because of the formation of about 35 Yo dimethyldidodecylamine. However, the formation of the tertiary amine (R3N) is limited to 3%, while on CuCr/graphite it is about l5O. 332 We suggest therefore that these products are the result of the following reactions: Hz HZ MeOH MeOH RC---N -- RCH=NH ---j RCH2NH2 - RCHZNHMe RCH2NMe2 and RCH=NH + RCHZNHMe - (RCHZ)ZNCH3 + NH3 the carbon (methyl)-nitrogen bond being formed before the second carbon (alkyl)-nitrogen bond. The copper chromite type catalysts are actually known for their particular properties of selective hydrogenation and for the synthesis of methanol starting from syngas. It therefore is possible that these same properties favour the synthesis of dimethyldodecylarnine. During the reaction, the hydrogenating properties of these solids would be slightly modified, allowing the formation of methyldidodecylamine starting from addition of methyldodecylamine to dodecylamine. This reaction scheme is preferable to the one involving formation of didodecylamine followed by its methylation, for which the tertiary amine (R3N) would be easily formed, which is not observed.

Guimon Laboratoire de Physicochimie Moléculaire, URA CNRS 474, Avenue de l'Université, 64000 Pau France Multifunctional copper chromite catalysts doped with barium and dispersed on a graphite support were used in the synthesis of dimethyldodecylamine and/or methyldidodecylamine from lauronitrile, ammonia, hydrogen and methanol. The reaction was carried out at 5 MPa and 250 °C. From XPS characterization of the catalysts, we observed that the promoter and the preparation method have an important effect on the surface composition and on the catalytic properties. Zero-valent copper increases the selectivity to tridodecylamine, which could be formed via a transalkylation reaction of the didodecylamine. On the other hand, the surface formation of a Baα,CuβCrγO4 phase (resulting from the insertion of barium in the CuCrO2 phase) significantly increases the selectivity to dimethyldodecylamine.
