Fax: +7-95-230-2224 Two silicon-containing catalyst systems for the olefin metathesis reaction are described. The first system, WCl6/Ph2SiH2, is active for all kinds of olefinic substrates: acyclic, cyclic and functionalized olefins, and alkadienes. The second system, W(CO)6/Ph2SiH2, is active for the metathesis of terminal olefins, but only under UV irradiation. Upon reaction between the catalyst components, a tungsten–silylene intermediate is formed as the precursor of the active species for metathesis. The product of a [2+2] cycloaddition of the tungsten–silylene complex was isolated. It showed catalytic activity for the metathesis of 1-hexene under UV irradiation, or at elevated temperature, when tungsten–silylene species could be generated from [W(CO)4]2[μ2-Si(C6H5)2]2. This is the first example of olefin metathesis with metal–silylene activation. Keywords Olefins Metathesis Organosilicon cocatalyst Tungsten–silylene intermediate 1 Introduction Nowadays, olefin metathesis attracts the attention of many chemists as a convenient reaction for the synthesis of fine chemicals and natural products. A wide range of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction is known [1]. Application of most of these catalysts is limited because of their low activity for the metathesis of functionalized olefins. Two popular types of homogeneous catalysts are the well-defined, stable molybdenum alkylidene complexes developed by Bazan et al. [2], and the ruthenium carbene complexes of Schwab et al. [3,4], which have high activity, stability and tolerance to many functional groups. Before the advent of well-defined metal carbene catalysts, several “classical” catalyst systems were developed that are active in the metathesis of functionalized olefins, such as WCl6 in combination with a silicon-containing cocatalyst [1]. From organosilicon chemistry, it is known that a number of stoichiometric and catalytic reactions based on silicon-containing transition metal systems involve silylene complexes as intermediates [5]. Numerous base-stabilized silylene complexes of the type L n M=SiR2(donor) [6] have been reported, as well as base-free silylene complexes of Pt and Ru [7]. The synthesis and structural characterization of transition-metal-substituted silylene complexes of Os, Pt, and Ru have also been described in the literature [8–10]. Possible applications in catalysis have driven progress towards defined properties and reactivities of silylene complexes of ruthenium [11] and rhodium [12]. Thus, a number of metal–silylene complexes that can be considered as analogues of metal–carbene complexes are well defined, although all of them are less stable. Our present study is devoted to catalyst systems for olefin metathesis based on tungsten compounds and organosilicon cocatalysts. These catalysts are of interest, not only because of their high activity in the metathesis of functionalized olefins, but also because of a rather unusual route for the formation of the active species. As a result of the reaction between the catalyst components, the formation of a tungsten–silylene complex is possible. For this reason, the study of the photo-activated reaction of the tungsten compound with Ph2SiH2 can elucidate the appearance of the catalytic activity. A mechanism with tungsten–silylene intermediates as the precursors of active species for olefin metathesis will be discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All manipulations were carried out using either high-vacuum techniques, or under an inert atmosphere with standard Schlenk techniques. Benzene and toluene were distilled from Na/K alloy. Ph2SiH2, (p-CH3C6H4)2SiH2, MePhSiH2, Et3SiH and (n-C3H7)2SiH2 were prepared as described in the literature [13–16]. These compounds were distilled from CaH2 and degassed with two freeze–pump–thaw cycles prior to use. WCl6, WOCl4, W(CO)6 and Mo(CO)6 were purified by vacuum sublimation and kept under argon. All of the esters — methyl, ethyl, and butyl 4-pentenoate and the corresponding alkyl-(2-allyl) 4-pentenoates — were prepared from the alkyl bromide and alkyl acetoacetate according to known procedures [17] and distilled before use. Bicyclo[2.2.1]-2-heptene (Fluka) was distilled from sodium wire. N-trifluoroacetyl-6,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-5-azabicyclo[2.2.1]-2-heptene (6) was prepared by a Diels–Alder reaction of 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2-trifluoromethyl-3-aza-4-oxo-2-pentene and cyclopentene in Et2O and hydroquinone as catalyst: yield 50%.

A calculated amount of the unsaturated substrate(s) was introduced into the tube, followed by the solution of WCl6 or WOCl4 in benzene. Next, a benzene solution of Ph2SiH2 was added. Then, the reaction mixture was frozen with liquid nitrogen. The argon was pumped off and the tube sealed. The reaction mixture was kept at 50–60°C for 6–10 h with stirring. After cooling and quenching with water, the mixture was extracted with Et2O, filtered and dried over CaSO4, and the ether was distilled off. Products were fractionated by vacuum distillation. Analysis was performed by GC (a glass column containing 8% SE-30 with DMCS on Carbowax W 80/100 mesh) and by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Kratos MS-80 spectrometer at ionization voltage of 70 eV). Photo-activated reactions were carried out in quartz tubes without solvent in a manner analogous to the previous experiments. A calculated amount of solid W(CO)6 or Mo(CO)6 was placed in the tube and 1-hexene and the organosilicon cocatalyst were added under an argon atmosphere. The tube was attached to a vacuum line. The mixture was frozen with liquid nitrogen and the argon was removed. The tube was then flame-sealed under vacuum. Irradiation was carried out with a medium-pressure Hg lamp (500 W) at 45°C. During irradiation, M(CO)6 dissolved in 1-hexene. The liquid phase was analysed after the reaction by GC and GC-MS. 2.3 Characterization of the main products Methyl 3-cyclopentene-1-carboxylate: b.p. 52–53°C (9 mm Hg). MS (m/z) (I, %): (126 [M+], 27). Ethyl 3-cyclopentene-1-carboxylate: b.p. 60–61°C (10 mm Hg). MS (m/z): (140 [M+], 35). Butyl 3-cyclopentene-1-carboxylate: b.p. 84–86°C (10 mm Hg).

MS (m/z): (250 [M+], 7). GC-MS analysis of the product mixtures of reaction 3 showed the presence of the following cross-metathesis products: with 411 [M+], 5, 411 [M+], 4, 411[M+], 7. The other products were detected as: 2.4 Preparation of [W(CO)4]2[μ-Si(C6H5)2]2 (9) The reaction was carried out in a quartz reactor with sealed glass tubes and breakable membranes for evacuation of gaseous products during the reaction. The tubes could be attached to a vacuum line for use in a trap-to-trap technique. W(CO)6 (54 mmol) was placed in the reactor under argon. Then, degassed Ph2SiH2 (54 mmol) and hexane (8 ml) were added. The mixture was frozen with liquid nitrogen and the argon was pumped off before the reactor was flame-sealed under a vacuum of 1×10−3 mm Hg. The reaction mixture was irradiated with a medium-pressure Hg lamp (500 W) at 45°C for 50 h with stirring. The reaction mixture changed from colourless to orange, accompanied by evolution of gases, which were detected by GC and MS as H2 and CO. The reactor was attached to the vacuum line using the sealed tubes every 2–3 h and the reaction mixture was frozen. The glass membrane was broken and CO and H2 were evacuated under reduced pressure. After 50 h, the reactor was attached to the vacuum line again and hexane, unreacted Ph2SiH2 and W(CO)6 were removed by distillation at 95°C using a liquid nitrogen trap. The resulting orange-brown residue was crystallized from 2 ml of hexane at −40°C. Compound 9 was obtained in 40% yield as orange needles, which are stable under argon.

The latter catalyst system was used earlier for the metathesis of functionalized olefins by Levisalles et al. [20]. We showed that a catalyst based on WCl6 and Ph2SiH2 can also be applied to the synthesis of five-membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds either via ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of unconjugated functionalized dienes, or via cross-metathesis of norbornene derivatives with linear olefins, giving high yields and selectivity [19]. Table 1 shows new results with these catalyst systems. In the table, the yields are given of the derivatives of 3-cyclopentene-1-carboxilic acids (2) obtained by RCM of the corresponding dienes (alkyl 2-allyl-4-pentenoate (1)) at 60°C in a benzene solution of WCl6/Ph2SiH2 or WOCl4/Ph2SiH2 (reaction 1). (1) The best results were obtained with a molar substrate/catalyst ratio of 50/1; in all cases, the selectivity was high. This might be of interest for, e.g., medicinal chemistry, because compounds of type 2 are components of a remedy against leprosy [21]. Another way of synthesizing five-membered cyclic compounds is the cross-metathesis between norbornene, or its derivatives, and linear substrates. We used the catalyst system WCl6/Ph2SiH2 for cross-metathesis of norbornene and azanorbornene derivatives with linear olefins or unsaturated esters (reaction 2) (2) . Table 2 shows the results for the cross-metathesis of norbornene with ethyl 4-pentenoate. A rather high selectivity was obtained: the formation of the unsymmetrical substituted products is favoured. The side reactions were self-metathesis of both substrates and secondary metathesis reactions, leading to symmetrical products. Cross-metathesis of an azanorbornene derivative with a simple olefin produces pyrrolidine derivatives (reaction 3). The yields of pyrrolidine derivatives (7a,b) were not high (Table 3) . High-molecular weight products of the self-metathesis of the azanorbornene derivative were also obtained: (3) The catalyst system WCl6/Ph2SiH2 is of interest, not only because of its activity for all kinds of substrate, but also because of the unusual route for active species formation. Levisalles et al. [20] supposed that in this case, the reactions occur via tungsten–silylene intermediates, although evidence was not provided. It is indeed impossible to characterize tungsten–silylene complexes that could be produced during that reaction. Therefore, we studied the model catalyst system W(CO)6/Ph2SiH2, and some related systems, in the olefin metathesis reaction. These systems showed catalytic properties for the metathesis of terminal olefins under UV irradiation. Table 4 gives the results of the metathesis of 1-hexene in the presence of the catalyst system M(CO)6/R2SiH2, M=W or Mo. All of the reactions were carried out without a solvent under UV irradiation using a 500 W Hg lamp. By-products formed were 2-hexene and cross-metathesis products. The best catalyst system was W(CO)6 in combination with the cocatalysts containing two aromatic groups, viz. Ph2SiH2 or (p-Tol)2SiH2. The catalyst systems with Mo(CO)6 showed lower activity compared with the tungsten-containing catalyst. R3SiH did not form an active catalyst with W(CO)6 or Mo(CO)6. Formation of active species for these catalyst systems might be possible via metal–silylene intermediates, L n W=SiR2. We studied a model reaction between equimolar amounts of W(CO)6 and Ph2SiH2 under UV irradiation. Scheme 1 shows two routes (a and b) that can be envisaged for tungsten–silylene formation. The tungsten–silylene intermediate 8 is suggested as being formed during the photo-activated reaction. This complex, with a double bond between tungsten and silicon atoms, is very unstable, similar to other compounds with a double bond to the silicon atom [22,23]. As a result, metallacycle 9 is formed via a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction. The same reaction was observed for a ruthenium–silylene complex [10]. Product 9 was the only compound that could be isolated, as stable (under argon) orange needles with m.p. 147–147.5°C. The reaction took place in hexane for 50 h at 45°C under irradiation with a 500 W Hg lamp. When CO and H2 were removed every 2 h, the yield of 9 was 40%. In a separate experiment, it was demonstrated that photolysis of Ph2SiH2 results in the formation of polysilanes and elimination of H2 (route c). The cyclodimer 9 was tested for 1-hexene metathesis under UV irradiation or elevated temperature (Table 5) . The results demonstrate that the cyclodimer 9 can act as a catalyst precursor for the metathesis of terminal olefins when the reverse reaction of the [2+2] cycloaddition with formation of tungsten silylene species takes place. The results also show that the tungsten–silylene complex 8, which was produced during the reaction of W(CO)6 and Ph2SiH2, can act as an active species and interact with the double bond of the olefinic substrate as well as metal–carbene complexes do. On the other hand, a [2+2] cyclodimerization can take place with the formation of a four-membered cyclic compound ( 9 ), resulting in the disappearance of catalytic properties. At elevated temperature, or under UV irradiation, when compound 9 was destroyed with generation of tungsten–silylene species, it again showed catalytic properties (Scheme 2) . Complex 8 may be considered as an analogue of the carbene complex (CO)5W=CPh2 that shows some catalytic activity for the metathesis of 2-pentene [24]. It can be concluded that formation of active species for olefin metathesis seems to be possible via tungsten–silylene or tungsten–silacyclobutane intermediates. 4 Conclusions The two catalyst systems, WCl6/Ph2SiH2 and W(CO)6/Ph2SiH2-hν ,are active in the metathesis of olefins. Upon reaction between the catalyst components, a tungsten–silylene intermediate is formed as the precursor of the active species for metathesis. This is the first example of olefin metathesis with metal–silylene activation, and opens new possibilities for creating novel types of olefin metathesis catalysts.
