Tel.: +86-21-65642792; fax: +86-21-65641740 Nanosized anatase TiO2 has been prepared by a sol–gel hydrothermal process. The effect of water:alkoxide molar ratio, hydrothermal aging temperature and aging time on the properties of the nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 was investigated in detail. The specific surface area, sulfur content and surface acidity of sulfated titania catalysts prepared by sulfation of sol–gel hydrothermal derived nanocrystalline TiO2 were greater than those of the analogous catalyst prepared from ordinary amorphous titania hydrate. The former catalysts displayed higher catalytic activities in isopropanol dehydration, cumene cracking and n-pentane conversion reactions. The influence of the crystalline state and crystalline grain of titania precursors on the properties of sulfated titania catalysts was studied and discussed. Keywords Sol–gel hydrothermal process Nanosized TiO2 Sulfated titania Solid acid catalyst 1 Introduction Sulfated metal oxides such as sulfated zirconia, titania, tin oxide and iron oxide are solid strong acids that have arisen increasing interest in recent years because of their high thermostability, strong acidity and unique catalytic activities in many environmentally benign reactions [1–5]. The method of preparation significantly affects the catalytic properties of these materials. Numerous methods have been reported in the literature in particular for the preparation of sulfated zirconia. They differ mainly in the type of oxide precursor, type of sulfating agent, method of impregnation and calcination temperature. Sometimes the results are controversial because different experimental techniques or test reactions have been used to characterize these materials. It has been reported in the literature [1,6–10] that amorphous Zr(OH)4 or Ti(OH)4 should be used as the precursor for sulfation to ensure high sulfur content and strong acidity, but a few authors have found that sulfated zirconia catalysts obtained by H2SO4 impregnation of a crystalline ZrO2 [11] or a zirconia aerogel [12] followed by calcination have identical acidity and activity as catalysts prepared from amorphous zirconia hydrate. Among the sulfated metal oxides, sulfated zirconia is known to possess the strongest acidity and exhibit superior activity to many acid-catalyzed reactions. Hence, a great deal of research works in this area have been concentrated on the study of this type of material. In comparison to the voluminous literatures on sulfated zirconia, knowledge of sulfated titania is limited. However, the latter material has been found to be efficient for catalyzing isomerization [13–15], alkylation [8,16–18], Friedel–Crafts acylation [19,20], esterification [21–23], CFC decomposition [24,25], photocatalytic oxidation [26,27] and selective catalytic reduction of NO x [28]. The increasing application of sulfated titania draws our attention to the study of the influence of preparation parameters on its properties and catalytic activities. In this work, nanosized anatase TiO2 was prepared by a sol–gel hydrothermal method [29] and used as the precursor for preparation of SO4 2−/TiO2. The physicochemical properties, surface acidity and catalytic activities of SO4 2−/TiO2 prepared from this type of nanosized anatase TiO2 and conventional amorphous titania hydrate were investigated and compared in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Anatase TiO2 nanocrystals were prepared by a combination of conventional sol–gel hydrolysis precipitation and hydrothermal processing [29]. In a typical synthesis, 0.1mol titanium butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4) was dissolved in 1.5mol anhydrous ethanol, and the butoxide solution was added dropwise to a water–ethanol solution containing 1mol ethanol with rigorous stirring at room temperature. The water:alkoxide molar ratio ranged between 5 and 150 in this paper. A white precipitate of hydrous oxide was formed and the mixture was stirred for 3h. Then the mother liquor containing the amorphous precipitate was transferred to a stainless steel autoclave and aged at 80–180°C for 1–5 days, followed by filtering, washing with deionized water and drying at 110°C overnight. The products were denoted as SGH-TiO2–r–t–d, where r means the water:alkoxide molar ratio, t the hydrothermal treatment temperature (°C) and d the aging time (days). For comparison, two other precursors were prepared: (1) amorphous Ti(OH)4 (A-TiO2) was prepared by dropping aqueous ammonia to TiCl4 dissolved in HCl till pH=9–10, aging at room temperature for 24h, washing, filtering and drying at 110°C overnight; (2) precrystallized TiO2 (A-TiO2 (500°C)) was prepared by calcining the amorphous Ti(OH)4 powder at 500°C for 3h. Sulfated titania samples were prepared by immersing the above titania precursors in 1mol/l H2SO4 solution for 30min, followed by filtering, drying at 110°C overnight and calcining at 500°C for 3h. 2.2 Characterization BET surface area of the samples was measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment using N2 as the adsorbent. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed on a computer-controlled Rigaku D/MAX-IIA instrument with Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 20mA with scan speed 8°/min and scan range 10–80°. The crystallite size of various samples was estimated by applying Scherrer formula on the (101) diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2. The amount of acid sites was measured by NH3-TPD in a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure. The 0.1g sample was heated at 500°C for 2h and cooled to 120°C in flowing He. At 120°C, the sample was treated by sufficient pulses of NH3 till adsorption saturation, followed by a He purge for about 2h. The temperature was raised up from 120 to 500°C at a rate of 10°C/min to desorb NH3, and then was further maintained at 500°C for 0.5h. Sulfur content of the samples was determined by a chemical method. Dehydrated Na2CO3 and ZnO (1:4) were used as fusing agents, and the sulfate was turned into BaSO4 and detected by gravimetric method. 2.3 Reaction testing The dehydration of isopropanol was performed in a pulsed microreactor with a catalyst load of 50mg. The catalyst was preheated in H2 flow at 250°C for 3h. H2 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The amount of isopropanol injected for each test was 5μl and the reaction temperatures were 150, 175 and 200°C. The activity of the samples toward cumene cracking reaction was tested in a pulsed microreactor loaded with 50mg catalyst. The catalyst was preheated under N2 atmosphere at 350°C for 3h. H2 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 40ml/min. The amount of cumene injected for each test was 1μl and the reaction temperature was 300°C. n-Pentane conversion reaction was carried out in a pulsed microreactor under ambient pressure on 0.4g catalyst. The catalyst was preheated under N2 atmosphere at 400°C for 3h. Upon reaction, the carrier gas was N2 with a flow rate of 30ml/min. The amount of n-pentane injected for each pulse was 0.5μl and the reaction temperatures were 325 and 350°C. 3 Results 3.1 Sol–gel hydrothermal derived TiO2 In the preparation of sulfated titania, sulfation of the oxide precursor is usually carried out by immersing dried oxide precursor into a dilute H2SO4 solution allowing adequate adsorption of SO4 2− onto the precursor. Then the sulfated precursor is calcined at a high temperature to produce highly covalent sulfate structure on the surface, which is considered as the source of the strong acidity on this type of material. It was expected that the specific surface area of the oxide precursor might exert a significant influence on the properties of the final catalyst. Thus, the effect of water:alkoxide molar ratio, aging temperature and aging time on BET surface area of sol–gel hydrothermal derived TiO2 was investigated in detail and the results were illustrated in Fig. 1 . The BET surface area of the SGH-TiO2 samples was sensitive to the water:alkoxide molar ratio as the water:alkoxide ratio was below 30. For most of the samples increasing the water:alkoxide ratio from 5 to 30 led to an increase in the surface area. Samples SGH-TiO2–5–80–1, SGH-TiO2–5–80–3, SGH-TiO2–15–80–1 and SGH-TiO2–15–80–3 were exceptional, because crystallization was incomplete after aging at 80°C for 1 and 3 days. For systems with the water:alkoxide ratio greater than 30, increasing the water:alkoxide ratio had no significant effect on the BET surface area of the samples. The above observations are consistent with the results in the literature [29]. The BET surface area of SGH-TiO2 decreased as the aging temperature was raised from 80 to 180°C and the aging time was prolonged from 1 to 5 days. However, the effect of aging time was less pronounced than that of aging temperature. BET surface areas of the SGH-TiO2 samples prepared with a water:alkoxide ratio of 50 were in the range of 149–223m2/g. The calculated equivalent sizes of TiO2 nanocrystals would be 6.9–10.3nm, assuming a monodispersed spherical morphology. The variation of BET surface area with calcination temperature for various titania samples was illustrated in Fig. 2 . The surface area of A-TiO2 decreased drastically at 300–350°C when the phase transformation from amorphous titania to anatase was accomplished. Although the initial surface areas of SGH-TiO2 samples were smaller than that of A-TiO2, the reduction in their surface area with calcination temperature was much slower, showing that nanocrystals of anatase TiO2 prepared by sol–gel hydrothermal process are thermally more stable than amorphous TiO2. At calcination temperatures above 350°C, BET surface areas of the samples were in the order of A-TiO2<SGH-TiO2–50–180–1<SGH-TiO2–50–80–1. For example, BET surface areas of A-TiO2, SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 and SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 calcined at 500°C were 34.8, 62.9 and 94.5m2/g, respectively (see Table 1 ). XRD patterns of SGH-TiO2 samples prepared with a water:alkoxide ratio of 50 were compared with those of A-TiO2 and A-TiO2 (500°C) in Fig. 3 . A-TiO2 prepared by hydrolysis of TiCl4 with ammonia solution was amorphous in nature and had a high BET surface area of 367m2/g. A-TiO2 (500°C) obtained by calcining A-TiO2 at 500°C was crystalline anatase with intense diffraction peaks, as its BET surface area was only 34.8m2/g. All the SGH-TiO2 samples displayed low and broad diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2. The crystallite sizes of the SGH-TiO2 samples aged at 80, 120 and 180°C for 1 day were estimated to be 6.5, 7.5 and 10nm, respectively, by applying Scherrer formula on the (101) diffraction peaks. These results coincide very well with those calculated from BET surface areas. XRD patterns of various TiO2 samples calcined at 500°C were compared in Fig. 4 . No rutile peaks were detected in all these patterns. The intensity of the anatase peaks decreased in the order of A-TiO2 (500°C)>SGH-TiO2–50–180–1>SGH-TiO2–50–80–1, and the estimated crystallite sizes of those three samples using Scherrer formula were 50, 25 and 15nm, respectively. This further confirms that the nanocrystals of SGH-TiO2 are thermally more stable. After calcination at 500°C, the crystallite sizes of SGH-TiO2 are two-fold or three-fold smaller than that of A-TiO2 (500°C). 3.2 Sulfated titania catalysts Sulfated titania catalysts were prepared using A-TiO2, A-TiO2 (500°C), SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 and SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 as precursors and characterized. The characterization results of the catalysts were listed and compared with those of the neat precursors in Table 1. BET surface areas of SO4 2−/A-TiO2, SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 and SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 calcined at 500°C were lower than those of the non-calcined precursors but higher than those of the precursors calcined at 500°C. The XRD characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 for these SO4 2−/TiO2 samples calcined at 500°C were lower and broader than those for the corresponding precursors calcined at 500°C, as shown in Fig. 5 . These observations are in support of the generally recognized viewpoint that sulfation inhibits the sintering of titania and stabilizes the surface area of sulfated titania catalyst [4]. Data in Table 1 show that finer anatase crystallites are found in sulfated titania catalysts than in pure titania calcined at the same temperature, which accounts for the smaller reduction in surface area upon calcination for the sulfated titania catalysts. The measured BET surface areas of the catalysts were in the order of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–80–1>SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–180–1>SO4 2−/A-TiO2⪢SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (500°C). In general, the pore volume of the samples is related to their crystallite size. The pore volume is increased as the anatase crystallite size in the samples becomes finer and more uniform. According to the results of chemical analysis, the sulfur content of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 was slightly higher than that of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 and SO4 2−/A-TiO2. The sulfur content of SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (500°C) was much lower than that of all the other catalysts due to the limited initial adsorption of sulfate on the precrystallized anatase precursor with a low surface area. The surface acidity of the catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method. The NH3-TPD profiles of the sulfated catalysts were shown in Fig. 6 . There was only one asymmetric broad peak on the profiles, and no evident peak temperature could be read out from the profiles. The maxima of the NH3 adsorption peaks were approximately in the range of 350–450°C, indicating that the catalysts were abundant in medium-strong acid sites. The total amount of acid sites of the catalysts followed the order of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 (0.79mmol/g)>SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 (0.72mmol/g)>SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (0.66mmol/g)>SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (500°C) (0.45mmol/g), which was parallel to the order of their surface area. 3.3 Activity testing The catalytic behavior of the sulfated titania catalysts towards acid-catalyzed reactions requiring acid sites with different acid strengths, such as isopropanol dehydration, cumene cracking and n-pentane conversion, has been investigated. Isopropanol dehydration is known to be catalyzed by weak acid sites. The conversion of isopropanol on various catalysts as a function of reaction temperature was shown in Fig. 7 . Non-sulfated TiO2 was inactive for the reaction under these reaction temperatures, but an obvious enhancement in activity was observed for all the sulfated catalysts. However, there was a marked difference in activity among the catalysts prepared from different titania precursors. At all the three reaction temperatures, the dehydration activity followed the order of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–80–1>SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2–50–180–1>SO4 2−/A-TiO2>SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (500°C), which was the same as that of their total acidity. Cumene converts to benzene and propene on acid catalysts with medium-strong and strong acid sites. The conversion of cumene dropped rapidly with increasing pulse number because of coking on the sulfated catalysts. The variation of cumene conversion with pulse number on the catalysts at 300°C was shown in Fig. 8 . The initial activity of the catalysts for cumene cracking followed the same order as that for isopropanol dehydration, implying that the SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2 catalysts have not only greater total acidity but also greater medium-strong and strong acidity. The catalytic performance of the catalysts in n-pentane conversion was similar to that in cumene cracking. The conversion of n-pentane also decreased rapidly with increasing pulse number due to coking on the catalysts. The initial conversion of n-pentane and the product distribution for different catalysts at 325 and 350°C were listed in Table 2 . The main reaction product was C3. The selectivity to C4 was higher than that to C2 at 325°C, and au contraire at 350°C. The sequence of the initial activities of the catalysts in this reaction was similar to that in cumene cracking, which again confirms that SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2 catalysts have more medium-strong and strong acid sites than SO4 2−/A-TiO2 and SO4 2−/A-TiO2 (500°C) catalysts. 4 Discussion Experimental results in this work demonstrate that the type of precursor plays an important role in the preparation of sulfated oxide catalysts. The fact that the catalysts prepared from sol–gel hydrothermal derived nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 have greater surface area and higher catalytic activity than ordinary SO4 2−/TiO2 catalyst prepared from amorphous titania hydrate tells that to use amorphous oxide as precursor is no more a requisite for the preparation of a good sulfated oxide catalyst. The validity of the generally realized concept that sulfation of crystallized oxide does not produce strong acidity [4] becomes questionable, since both SGH-TiO2–50–180–1 and SGH-TiO2–50–80–1 are nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 with distinct reflections in their XRD patterns. Furthermore, it is also interesting to note that not all nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 are good precursors. Precrystallized A-TiO2 (500°C) with a crystallite size of 50nm obtained by calcination of amorphous titania belongs to the category of anatase nanocrystals as well, but the sulfated catalyst prepared using A-TiO2 (500°C) as a precursor displays low surface area and poor activity. Therefore, it is clear that amorphous or crystalline, crystalline or nanocrystalline are not the watersheds between a good and a poor precursor. Careful measurements of the samples at different preparative stages in the present work suggest that there are other factors controlling the quality of the oxide precursors used for the preparation of sulfated oxide catalysts. It has been noted that the crystalline grain and specific surface area of the oxide precursor exert a significant influence on the properties of the catalyst. Catalysts obtained by sulfating SGH-TiO2 with smaller crystalline grain and higher surface area possess greater sulfate content and higher activity, whereas sulfating A-TiO2 (500°C) with larger crystalline grain and lower surface area gives unsatisfactory results although both precursors are nanocrystalline anatase TiO2. Since sulfation of the oxide is carried out by SO4 2− adsorption onto the precursor, a smaller crystalline grain and a higher surface area of the precursor enhance the adsorption and, hence, increase the sulfate content of the final catalyst, even if a part of the sulfate is lost during thermal activation of the catalyst. On the other hand, a larger amount of sulfate adsorbed in the precursor inhibits the sintering of the oxide more efficiently upon calcination [4]. These two reasons may explain the positive effect of the small crystalline grain and high specific surface area of the SGH-TiO2 precursors on the properties of the final sulfated oxide catalysts. Nevertheless, the initial surface area is not the sole criterion for an oxide precursor, because the surface area and activity of SO4 2−/A-TiO2 catalyst prepared from amorphous A-TiO2 with a BET surface area as high as 367m2/g are appreciably lower than those of SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2 catalysts. Such an apparent abnormality may be explained on the basis of thermostability. After sulfation, the titania precursors must be calcined at a high temperature (>500°C) to produce strong acidity. In our previous work, it has been observed that the transition of amorphous TiO2 to crystalline anatase TiO2 takes place at 350 and 500°C for pure TiO2 and sulfated TiO2, respectively [13]. The phase transition is accompanied by a significant reduction in surface area as shown in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the nanocrystals of anatase TiO2 in sulfated SGH-TiO2 samples are more thermally stable. Upon calcination, there is no phase transition and the presence of SO4 2− species stabilizes the surface area, so the final SO4 2−/SGH-TiO2 catalysts retain higher surface areas and higher catalytic activities. The structure of the surface sulfate complex and the nature (Lewis or Bronsted type) of the strong acid sites on sulfated oxide catalysts are still a subject of debate, because technological advances to date are inadequate for a complete characterization of these catalysts. However, information in the literature [12,30–32] show that the texture of sulfated zirconia catalysts prepared from amorphous, aerogel and precrystallized zirconia differs from each other, but the feature of the active sites on these catalysts is much the same. This is probably also true for sulfated titania catalysts prepared from different precursors according to the results of this work. From the XRD, NH3-TPD and activity measurements there is no evident indication that the nature of the surface sulfate species has been altered due to the change of precursors. The acidity and the catalytic activities of the catalysts toward various acid-catalyzed reactions correlate fairly well with their sulfur content and specific surface area, implying that the variation in texture of the catalysts rather than in structure or nature of the active sites accounts for the difference in the catalysts.
