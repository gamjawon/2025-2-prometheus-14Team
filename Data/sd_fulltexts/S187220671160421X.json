Silica-bound N-propyl triethylenetetramine sulfamic acid was employed as a recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicotinonitriles from the multi-component reaction of an acetophenone derivative, an aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, and ammonium acetate under solvent-free conditions at 100 Â°C. The heterogeneous catalyst was recycled for five consecutive runs in the optimized multi-component reaction of 4-chloroacetophenone, 4-chloroenzaldehyde, malononitrile, and ammonium acetate without significant loses to its catalytic activity. Key words: silica-bonded N-propyl triethylenetetramine sulfamic acid; 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicotinonitrile; pyridine; aldehyde; solvent-free Pyridine and its derivatives are important structural motifs and are present in a great number of pharmaceutical com- pounds and natural products [1â€“6]. The unique structural arrays and highly pronounced biological and physiological activities [1â€“6] displayed by such compounds have made them attractive synthetic targets, with 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicotininotriles being especially considered as an important class of bio-active compounds [4â€“6]. For example, 2-aminopyridine derivatives have recently been identified as anti-microbial agents [7], IKK-È• inhibitors [8], and potent inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase [9]. Although there are multiple reports in the literature de- scribing the synthesis of 2-amino-3-cyanopyridines, the ma- jority of these procedures require multiple steps [10], long reaction times, toxic solvents such as benzene [11], high tem- peratures or microwave assistance [12], resulting in disap- pointingly low yields. In contrast, straight-forward and effi- cient one-pot catalytic procedures for the synthesis of 2-amino-3-cyanopyridines under mild conditions are still lim- ited. Most recently, there have been reports describing the synthesis of 2-amino-3-cyanopyridines according to a two step synthesis [13] using either a BrÃ¶nsted acidic ionic liquid at 150 Â°C [14] or Yb(PFO) 3 in refluxing ethanol [15]. Several types of solid sulfonic acid functionalized silica (both amorphous and ordered) have been synthesized and applied as alternatives to the traditional sulfonic acid resins and homogeneous acids in catalyzing chemical transformations [16â€“24]. In a continuation of our own studies on the design and application of solid acid catalysts in organic transformations [17â€“24], we herein describe the preparation of silica-bound N-propyl triethylenetetramine sulfamic acid (SBPTETSA) and its application as a catalyst for the synthesis of 2-amino-4,6- diarylnicotinonitriles. SBPTETSA was prepared by the reaction of 3-triethylene- tetramine-N-propylsilica (3-PNPS) with chlorosulfonic acid in chloroform (Scheme 1). 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1312â€“1317 Chemicals were purchased from Fluka, Merck, and Aldrich. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were run on a Shi- madzu Infrared spectroscopy FT-IR-8000 and a Bruker spec- trum X. The 1 H and 13 C NMR was run on Bruker Avance (400 MHz) instruments in CDCl 3 . Melting points were recorded on a SMP1 melting point apparatus in open capillary tubes and are uncorrected. Reaction progress was followed by TLC using silica gel SILG/UV 254 plates. Chloropropyl silica was pre- pared according to a previously reported procedure [23]. All of the products were characterized by comparison of their IR, 1 H, and 13 C NMR spectroscopic data and their melting points with the reported values [7â€“15]. 1.1.1 Synthesis of 3-triethylenetetramine-N-propylsilica (3-TETANPS) To a mixture of chloropropyl silica (25 g) in anhydrous xy- lene (250 ml), an excess of triethylenetetramine (25 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was refluxed with stirring for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and filtered through a vacuum glass filter. The filter-cake was washed sequentially with xylene and a large excess of ethanol and dried under vacuum overnight at 80 Â°C to give the desired product 3-TETANPS (26.4 g). 1.1.2 Synthesis of SBPTETSA To a magnetically stirred mixture of 3-TETANPS (26.4 g) in CHCl 3 (50 ml) was added chlorosulfonic acid (25 ml) in a drop-wise manner at 0 Â°C over a period of 2 h. Upon comple- tion of the reaction, the mixture was stirred for a further 2 h and then filtered. The filter-cake was washed with ethanol (50 ml) and dried at room temperature to afford the desired product, SBPTETSA, as a cream powder (27.5 g). Elemental analysis found: S, 1.04%; C, 10.05%; H, 2.15%; N, 2.54%. The number of H + sites on the SBPTETSA was determined by pH-ISE conductivity titration (Denver Instru- ment Model 270) and found to be 0.6 mmol of H + sites per 1 g of solid acid at 25 Â°C (pH = 2.62). 1.2 General procedure for the synthesis of 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicotininitrile derivatives To a mixture of an acetophenone derivative (1.0 mmol), an aromatic aldehyde (1.0 mmol), malononitrile (1.0 mmol), and ammonium acetate (1.5 mmol) was added SBPTETSA (0.07 g, equivalent to 0.042 mmol of H + ) and the resulting mixture was heated at 100 Â°C under solvent-free conditions. Upon comple- tion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), ethanol (5 ml) was added and the resulting mixture was filtered. The filter-cake was washed with warm ethanol (5 ml Ã— 3) to effectively clean the catalyst. The filtrates were subsequently combined and provided the products were recrystallized from ethanol. The recovered catalyst was dried and reused in the subsequent runs. 2-Amino-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-nicotinonitrile (1a).

An initial mass loss from the SBPTETSA up to 120 Â°C was caused by the removal of physically adsorbed Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1312â€“1317 solvent and surface hydroxyl groups. A mass loss accounting for approximately 11.58% of the initial mass occurred between 220 and 410 Â°C and was attributed to the thermal decomposi- tion of the organic groups. The covalent chemical bonds within the catalyst bestowed high thermal stability on the structure. The FT-IR spectrum of SBPTETSA is shown in Fig. 2. The major peaks for silica (SiO 2 ) are the broad anti-symmetric Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching mode from 1300 to 1000 cm â€“1 and the symmetric Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching mode near 820â€“750 cm â€“1 . For sulfamic acid functional group, the FT-IR absorption ranges of the O=S=O asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes were located at 1170 and 1060 cm â€“1 , respectively. The FT-IR spec- trum revealed an overlap in the asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of SO 2 with the Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching bands in the silica functionalized alkyl-sulfamic acid. The spectrum also contained a broad OH stretching absorption from 3600 to 3200 cm â€“1 . NH stretching and bending occurred at 3420 and 1650 cm â€“1 , respectively. The one-pot synthesis of 1b was selected as a model reaction for our study. A mixture of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1 mmol), 4-chloroacetophenone (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), ammonium acetate (1.5 mmol), and different catalytic loading of SBPTETSA was stirred under solvent-free conditions at 100 Â°C (Table 1). It is clear from the results that SBPTETSA per- formed as an effective catalyst in this four-component con- densation reaction. The best catalytic loading of SBPTETSA from the experiments conducted was 0.07 g in terms of reaction time and isolated yield. The application of a lower temperature gave the corresponding product in lower yield, with an ex- tended reaction time being required to drive the reaction to higher levels of conversion (Table 1, entry 6). The reaction conditions outlined in entry 3 of Table 1 were subsequently identified as the optimized conditions, involving the heating of a mixture of an acetophenone derivative (1 mmol), an aldehyde (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), ammonium acetate (1.5 mmol), and SBPTETSA (0.07 g, equal to 0.04 mmol of H + ) at 100 Â°C under solvent-free conditions. With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we pro- ceeded to investigate the scope of the reaction by employing a wide range of aromatic aldehydes in the process (Table 2). The reaction performed well, providing the corresponding 2-amino-3-cyanopyridines in good to high yields, demon- strating the generality of the method and its good tolerance of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring of the aldehyde. For example, aromatic aldehydes containing electron-donating substituents, including 4-OMe, 4-SMe, and 4-Me, reacted with acetophenone deriva- tives, including 4-chloro- and 4-fluoro-acetophenone under the optimized conditions, to provide the corresponding products in good to high yields (Table 2, entries 3â€“7). Furthermore, aromatic aldehydes containing electron- withdrawing substituents, including 4-NO 2 and 3-NO 2 reacted with 4-methyl-acetophenone and malononitrile under the op- timized conditions to afford the corresponding products in high yield (Table 2, entries 11 and 12). Ortho-substituted aromatic aldehydes also reacted successfully in this four component condensation (Table 2, entry 9). It is worthy of note that this method not only affords the products in good to high yields but 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 M a s s ( % ) Temperature ( o C) Fig. 1.

Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1312â€“1317 also effectively avoids problems associated with catalyst cost, handling, safety, and pollution. The possibility of recycling the catalyst was examined using the reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-chloroacetophenone, malononitrile, and ammonium acetate under the optimized conditions (Fig. 3). Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture was filtered and the filter-cake was washed with ethanol. The filter-cake of solid catalyst was then collected and stored ahead of the next reaction. The recycled catalyst could be reused five times without any further treatment. Further- more, no appreciable loss was observed in the catalytic activity of the SBPTETSA catalysts over the five recycling runs. 3 Conclusions Silica-bound propyl triethylenetetramine sulfamic acid effi- ciently catalyzed the synthesis of 2-amino-4,6-diarylnicoti- nonitriles via a four component condensation reaction. The simplicity of this procedure, together with the eco-friendly, non-volatile, easy-to-handle, non-hazardous, and recyclable nature of catalyst, represents the main advantages of this method.
