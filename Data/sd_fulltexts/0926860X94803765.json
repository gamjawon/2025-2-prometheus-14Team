Box 125, Pohang 790-600, South Korea Received 6 September 1993; revised 7 April 1994; accepted 14 April 1994 Abstract Copper dispersed on an alkali-doped silica support, when properly prepared using a precipitation method, was found to be better than CuMgO and CuZnO as regards conversion, selectivity, and especially resistance against sintering for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. The optimum precipitation conditions were a precipitation temperature of 90 C, a precipitation time of 4 h and the final pH of the solution higher than 9. The high solution pH was intended to neutralize acidic sites of the support, which were responsible for the formation of side products. The lowest copper loading was desirable to achieve the highest conversion, but the copper loading should be kept above 12% to suppress effectively the formation of side products on the alkali-treated silica surface. Temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and reaction tests revealed that catalysts prepared under the above conditions had highly dispersed metallic copper particles stabilized on a neutralized silica surface.

It is generally produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. Although the selectivity for cyclohexanone is very high (i.e., more than 95%), the reversibility the reaction limits its conversion to a low value (for example, 65 % at 250 C ) [ 1 ] . To overcome the limitation in the conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation route has recently been attempted using Cu /ZnO as a catalyst [2]. However, the *Corresponding author. Tel.

Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29-44 selectivity to cyclohexanone in the oxidation route is not high enough to compete with that in the dehydrogenation route. Catalysts reported to be suited for the dehydrogenation reaction include various forms of copper such as CuMgO [ 3 ] , CuZnO [ 4 ] , Cu-Cr-0 [ 5 ] , CuZnO/A1203 [ 6 ] , and Cu-Fe-0 [ 7 ] . Carbon-supported nickel [ 8 ] or tin oxide [ 9 ] were also reported in the literature. The active site for the dehydrogenation reaction was studied very recently by Sivaraj et al. [ 10 ] . They have shown that the main reaction is well correlated with the reversible carbon monoxide uptake, a measure of metallic copper species (Cu ) [ 11 ] . It is also well known that the by-product cyclohexene is formed via dehydration on the acidic sites of catalyst [ 7,12 ] . From these results, it may be deduced that any metallic copper dispersed on a support would be a good candidate for the reaction if the support is not acidic. The main issue is how to make copper particles which are well dispersed on the support and have a good resistance against sintering. Therefore, we tested a series of catalysts having copper dispersed on various supports such as MgO, ZnO, CoO, Cr203, Fe203, Ti02, M003, carbon, silica and alumina. Among the catalysts tested, the commercial materials CuZnO and CuMgO with a high loading of copper showed good performances both in conversion and selectivity. CuFeO was good as regards the sintering properties but showed lower selectivity than CuZnO, as reported previously [4,7]. Surprisingly, we found that copper supported on silica showed better performance than either CuZnO or CuMgO. To be used as a support, acidic sites on the silica should be neutralized with an alkali metal. The copper loading in this new Cu /silica catalyst could be kept relatively low (12%) when compared with that in CuZnO (above 30% [ 10] ). We report here the silica-supported copper catalyst as a potential candidate for the commercial application in the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. Preparation conditions have been studied to optimize the catalytic performance. The physical and surface properties were also measured to correlate them with the measured catalytic performance. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of the catalysts The support used in this study was aero-silica (Alfa, surface area; 400 m2/g). The catalysts were prepared by the deposition-precipitation method [ 13 ] . After introducing the support and an aqueous solution of Cu (N03) 2 . 5H20 (Aldrich) to a constant stirring vessel, an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (Aldrich) was slowly added to the vessel using a metering pump. When the solution pH in the vessel reached a constant value, the feeding of the sodium carbonate was stopped. The resulting precipitated slurry was aged for 2 h in the same stirring vessel. It was then filtered and washed with ample amounts of water, and this was followed by G.S. Jeon, J.S. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29O 31 drying at 110 C for 10 h. The dried cake was crushed and sieved to yield powder of 100-120 mesh size. The powder was calcined in a flow of air at 300 C for 12 h. 2.2. Reaction tests for the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation Reaction tests were carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. The reactor was made of pyrex tube with an I.D. of 1.0 cm. About 0.5 g of catalyst was charged in the reactor and the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was kept at 10 h-'. No carrier gas was used. Liquid cyclohexanol (Aldrich, 99%) fed with a syringe pump (Sage Instruments, model 341 B) was vaporized in an evaporator which was filled with glass beads and heated at 180 C. The feed lines located after the evaporator was heated to 180 C in order to avoid the condensation of cyclohexanol vapor. Before conducting the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in-situ using the following steps. First, after introducing 5% H2 diluted with N2 at a flow-rate of 50 cm3/min, the reactor was heated to 250 C and kept at the same temperature for 1 h. The flowing gas was then switched to pure hydrogen and the catalyst was reduced further for 4 h. The reducing gases were purified with Mn0/silica trap and molecular sieve 3A trap to remove oxygen and water, respectively. Before the start of the reaction, the hydrogen gas was switched to cyclohexanol vapor. A steady state was obtained in about 2 h after the start of reaction. A capillary column (Carbowax 20 M, 0.54 mm x 10 m) equipped with the flame ionization detector was used to analyze the effluent from the reactor. 2.3. Measurement of surface areas The BET surface area was measured using a BET measuring apparatus (Chemisorb 102, Micrometrics). Before nitrogen adsorption, the catalyst sample was evacuated for 2 h at 150 C. The dead volume of sample port was measured with helium gas. The surface area of the copper particles was estimated by carbon monoxide chemisorption using the same apparatus used for the BET measurement. Carbon monoxide gas (Specialty products and equipment, 99.95%) was purified with a Mn0/silica trap and a molecular sieve 3A trap to remove oxygen and water, respectively. After the catalyst was reduced in the same procedure as in the reaction test, it was evacuated at 250 C for 2 h. The evacuated sample was cooled to 25 C, and this was followed by evacuation for 1 h before the carbon monoxide chemisorption. The chemisorption of carbon monoxide was carried out in an increasing pressure mode. It was assumed that an equilibrium state was attained 30 min after each carbon monoxide dose. After measuring the first adsorption isotherm, the catalyst was evacuated for 30 min at 25 C in order to desorb reversibly adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules. This was followed by the second adsorption experiment with the same procedure as in the first adsorption isotherm experiment. It is well known that carbon monoxide adsorbs reversibly on a metallic Cu' surface while it does so irreversibly on the surface of Cu`. Therefore, the carbon monoxide 32 G.S. Jeon, JS. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29O uptake obtained from the second adsorption curve represents Cu while the difference in the carbon monoxide uptake between the first adsorption curve and the second one represents CuI. The copper surface area was calculated assuming that the surface density of copper was 1.41 X 10'9 atoms/mz [ 14]. The N20 reactive frontal chromatographic method [ 15 ] was used for another method of estimating the copper metal area. The principle of the method is that two atoms of copper metal may react with one molecule of nitrous oxide to generate one molecule of nitrogen. The titration was performed using a reactor and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) cell whose dead volume were minimized. The catalyst in the reactor was reduced as the same procedure as used for the activity test. After being reduced, it was cooled to 60 C in a flow (20 cm'/min) of helium. Then, pulses of 6% N20 diluted in helium were injected to the reactor. A plotter (Shimadzu, C-R6A) was used to measure the amount of generated nitrogen. 2.4. Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out using a TCD type detector cell. A gas flows through the sample and reference compartment of the cell which were connected in series. About 25 mg of a preoxidized catalyst sample was charged in a U-shaped reactor made of 1 /4 in. quartz tube. The catalyst reduced with the same procedure in the reaction test was dried at 150 C for 1 h in a flow of helium which was purified with Mn0/silica and 3A molecular sieve trap. After cooling to room temperature, the reactor was switched to a flow of a reducing gas, 5 % hydrogen in nitrogen. The gas was purified by the same method as used for helium. Temperature of the reactor was increased to 800 C at a rate of 3.4 C/min using a temperature controller. 2.5. Extent of reduction The extent of reduction of a catalyst which was reduced according to the same procedure as that for the reaction measurement was measured by titration with oxygen pulses at 400 C. The degree of reduction of the reference copper oxide and cuprous oxide samples were found to be 80.5% and 54.2%, respectively. 2.6. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using a Rigaku diffractometer (model D Max-B) with Cu Ka radiation to identify the copper phase and to calculate the size of the copper particles. The scan rate was 3 /min and the range of scan (29) was 3 -70 . The average copper particle size of the catalyst sample was calculated from the XLB (X-ray line broadening) analysis using the Scherrer equation, assuming a spherical shape [ 16]. Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, JEM-200CX) was used to measure the particle size of copper directly. The G.S. Jeon, J.S. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29-44 33 accelerating voltage was 200 kV, and the observation was usually made with a magnification of 200 000. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Comparison with other catalysts Table 1 lists the conversion of cyclohexanol and the selectivities for cyclohexanone for fresh and used silica-supported copper catalysts in comparison with other types of catalysts. As can be seen in Table 1, high selectivities for cyclohexanone were observed with the commercial type catalysts, Cu-MgO and Cu-ZnO. The recently reported copper-iron binary oxide [ 7 ] exhibited a lower selectivity than the other catalysts. The silica-supported copper catalysts showed the best performance in terms of conversion. The selectivity for cyclohexanone was dependent on the preparation conditions. A high selectivity was observed when the catalysts were prepared at high solution pHs (between 9 and 10). We believe that, during the precipitation of the copper precursor on the silica surface, an alkaline solution of sodium carbonate neutralizes the acidic sites on the silica surface. This is more evident from the fact that the catalyst prepared using the ammoniacal solution shows a poor selectivity. In this case, the silica surface must remain acidic since the ammonium ion leaves the silica surface during the calcination of the catalyst. Although not shown in the table, other supports such as alumina and zirconia were also tested after the alkali doping, either during the precipitation or by additional impregnation of an alkali solution. Poor results were obtained concerning the selectivity for cyclohexanone, probably because their acidities were too strong to be neutralized by alkali ions. Alkali-doped carbon and titania gave high selectiv- Table 1 Conversion of cyclohexanol and selectivity of cyclohexanone for various copper containing catalysts Copper loading=25%; Temp. =280 C; LHSV =10 h' Catalyst Precipitation pH Conversion (%) Selectivity (%) Fresh Deactivated Fresh Deactivated Cu-Mg0 7 66.6 17.5 98.0 89.3 Cu-Zn0 7 55.8 18.2 97.5 96.7 Cu-Fe304a - 65.1 36.4 92.8 90.8 CulSi02 7 74.7 - 16.8 - CU1Si02 8 71.9 - 80.7 - CulSi02 9 71.2 28.6 99.3 98.6 Cu/SiO2 10 73.2 29.1 98.9 98.1 Cu/Si02 10 82.4 - 56.2 - Cu/SiO2 11 48.9 - 99.5 - Cu/Fe=1/3, prepay according to ref. [7]. Ammonium hydroxide was used as the precipitating agent. 34 G.S Jeon, J.S. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General IIS (1994) 29-44 ities but the conversion and sintering resistance were not found to be satisfactory. To test the deactivation, catalysts were subjected to an accelerated deactivation. The used catalysts in Table 1 were subjected to a treatment at 280 C for 8 h and at 390 C for another 8 h, successively. The reaction at 390 C was intended to accelerate deactivation. Substantial decreases in the conversion and selectivities were observed with used catalysts. The conversion after the high temperature reaction decreased in the order Fe203 < Si02 < Zn0 < MgO, while the selectivity decreased in the order Si02 < Zn0 < Fe203 < MgO. Especially, Fe203 and Mg0 exhibited large drops in selectivity. The main by-products observed with these two deactivated catalysts were a deep dehydrogenation product, phenol and dehydrogenation-dimerization products such as cyclohexene cyclohexanone (CHA) and cyclohexylidene cyclohexanone (CHIA). The silica-supported catalyst produced small amounts of the dimerized products even after the deactivation. Fe203 is considered to be amphoteric and MgO is basic, whereas silica is weakly acidic. Therefore, it is concluded that the dimerized products are produced on the basic sites of the support. The used (deactivated) CU/Si02 catalysts showed little decrease in the selectivity compared with the fresh catalyst. For long periods of operation in the industrial plant, the reactor temperature is gradually raised to compensate for the conversion decrease. For this kind of constant conversion policy, it is very important to minimize the selectivity decrease. In this sense, Cu/Si02 is considered to be better than either Cu-Fe203 or Cu-ZnO. 3.2. Effect of precipitation temperature Preparation conditions during the precipitation of copper precursor onto the silica surface were studied to maximize the catalytic activity and selectivity. According to the results in Table 1, the final precipitation pH was fixed at 9 hereafter. Fig. 1 shows the effect of the precipitation temperature on the conversion and selectivity at three reaction temperatures. The conversion of cyclohexanol increased exponentially with increased precipitation temperature. Characterization results are also shown in Table 2. It is well known that the reversible carbon monoxide chemisorption represents Cu' while the irreversible carbon monoxide chemisorption represents Cut ions [ 11 ] . With increased precipitation temperature, the surface area of Cu increased while that of CuI did not change. It was well established that cyclohexanone is formed on the surface of Cu [ 2,7,10] . The increased surface area of Cu is responsible for the increased conversion of cyclohexanol. Interestingly, the surface area of copper obtained from the carbon monoxide chemisorption is always smaller than that calculated from the average copper particle size which was obtained from the X-ray line broadening. Therefore, it is believed that the copper surface is severely contaminated with a material which prevents carbon monoxide chemisorption. The material that contaminates the copper surface would be sodium inserted to adjust the precipitation pH and/or silica dissolved during the precipitation. As far as silica is concerned, it is well known G.S. Jean, J.S. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29-44 35 80 60 U 40 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 Precipitation Temp. ( C) Fig. 1.

LHSV; 10 h-'. that the solubility of silica increases with increasing solution temperature [ 17 ] . The dissolved silica may interact with precipitating copper to form some kind of copper silicate. Synthetic copper silicate was known to be mainly amorphous [ 18 ] . Therefore, it was impossible to identify the copper silicate from the X-ray measurements. The existence of an inert copper silicate was indirectly confirmed by the extent of the reduction shown in the last column of Table 2. From the results, it can be seen that, for catalysts prepared at low temperatures, copper particles dispersed on the silica surface yield a higher reduction than pure bulk copper oxide ( 80% ) . The degree of reduction decreases rapidly as the precipitation temperature increases. Remembering that the unreduced portion of Cu' remains almost constant regardless of the precipitation temperature, the difficulty in the reduction must result from the existence of another kind of unreducible copper, probably a form of copper silicate.

Jeon, J.S. Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (l9O) 29-44 The `ratio' in Table 2 was defined as the ratio of copper surface area calculated from the carbon monoxide chemisorption measurement to that from the XLB. Therefore, the ratio of 0.35 obtained at the precipitation temperature of 20 C, for example, indicates that 65% of physical copper surface (it is named `physical' since its particle size was obtained from the XLB measurement) is contaminated (with silica and/or sodium) and unable to chemisorb carbon monoxide molecules. Therefore, it is expected that the ratio decreases due to a higher contamination of silica as the precipitation temperature increases. Surprisingly, the ratio increased as if the copper surface became less contaminated with increased precipitation temperature. We believed that this is caused by the contribution of the copper surface from finely dispersed copper particles (less than 3 nm) which can not be detected by X-ray. For copper (2-10%) supported on silica that was prepared by ion-exchange [ 19-21 ] , the existence of such small (1.5 to 5 nm) copper metal clusters has been reported by using TEM and IR measurements of carbon monoxide chemisorption.

Representative TPR results for CU/Si02 catalysts prepared at different precipitation temperatures were illustrated in Fig. 2. Similar studies were done by other groups with 20% copper supported on alumina [ 22] . The alumina-supported copper catalysts showed three TPR peaks at 242 C, 312 C and 347 C. The first peak was assigned to finely dispersed Cu particles having sizes around 4-5 nm which were formed by the reduction of the CuA1204 phase. The second was the same as that of pure copper oxide which showed a peak at 317 C. The last peak was assigned to the reduction of Cu20. Copper-on-silica prepared by the ion-exchange method [ 19] showed only one TPR peak at 232 C which was assigned to finely dispersed copper having a size around 1.4 nm.

Unfortunately, we failed to detect any form of copper silicate by TPR, although another group reported synthetic copper silicate phases by TPR [ 23 ] .

Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29-44 39 The formation of relatively inert copper silicate phase might be responsible for the neutralization of acidic sites remaining on the alkali-treated silica surface and for the suppression of the formation of cyclohexene. The decrease in the formation of phenol with increase in temperature may be related to the increased amount of finely dispersed copper particles on the silica surface. 3.3. Effect of precipitation time The conversion of cyclohexanol was plotted as a function of the precipitation time in Fig. 4: Hereafter, the precipitation of the copper precursor was carried out at 90 C. The alkali solution was injected for 4 h until the final pH reached 9.0. The conversion was a weak function of the precipitation time showing a maximum at 4 h. The surface area of the copper particles and the BET surface area are shown in Table 3.

From the TPR results shown in Fig. 5, it can be concluded that the increased surface area results from the formation of finely dispersed copper particles. As the precipitation time exceeds 4 h, the amount of the finely dispersed copper begins to decrease probably owing to agglomeration of the fine particles. The total BET surface area decreased with increasing precipitation time. This was explained by dissolution and agglomeration of silica particles with increasing precipitation time. 3.4.

The selectivities of products were kept about the same when the copper content exceeds 12%. At low copper contents, for example at 6%, the selectivity to cyclohexene increased enormously while the selectivity to cyclohexanone decreased to a very low value. It is well known that acidic sites are responsible for the production of the dehydration product, cyclohexene [ 7,12 ] . Therefore, the increased production of cyclohexene, with the low copper loading of 6%, implies that the alkali doping during the precipitation is not sufficient to neutralize the silica surface. In addition to the doping, a high loading of copper onto the silica support is necessary to reduce the formation of cyclohexene by neutralizing acidic sites. In this sense, copper itself seems to behave as a material having basic properties. Indeed, Busca [24] demonstrated, using Fourier transform IR, that CuO has a basic character.

Chung /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 29-44 amount of magnesium (e.g., 1.0 wt.-% as shown in the second row of Table 4) was additionally doped on the surface of 6%Cu/Si02. Surprisingly, the selectivity patterns became almost the same as other catalysts having copper loadings higher than 12%. The TPR spectra for three different copper contents are shown in Fig. 7. When the copper content is low (6%), there exists only one TPR peak around 227 C which represents the finely dispersed copper clusters. The existence of these small copper clusters was also supported by the high values of the copper surface area (copper surface area per gram of copper) at low copper contents as shown in Table 5. Direct measurement by TEM showed copper particles having a size of 1.5 to 3 nm. These fine copper particles are difficult to reduce due to a strong interaction with the support, as can be seen in the last column of Table 5. When the copper content reaches 60%, only one large TPR peak is observed in the high temperature region of 277 C which represents a large bulk type copper particle. In this case, the extent of reduction also approaches the value of pure copper oxide (80%) as shown in Table 5. Interestingly, when the copper content exceeds 24%, the particle size of copper does not change appreciably with increased copper loading. The size was in the range of 7 to 10 nm regardless of the copper content. This was also evidenced by the constant peak position of the TPR peak at 277 C regardless of the copper loading. Finally, a plot of the conversion vs. the copper surface area was made for all the tested catalysts and this is shown in Fig. 8. It was found that the conversion was well correlated with the surface area of Cu . Sivaraj et al. [ 10] reported a similar result between the conversion and the copper surface area for the same reaction over Cu/alumina catalyst [ 12] . The results in Fig. 8 contains catalysts prepared at various conditions including precipitation temperatures of 20-90 C, precipitation times of 0-12 h, and copper loadings from 6% to 96%. Thus, the catalysts contain various kinds of copper particles; finely dispersed copper, large particles of bulk Table 5 Effect of copper content on the copper surface area, BET area and the extent of reduction Copper content Copper surface area DP' BET surface area Extent of reduction (wt.-%) (nm) (m2lg-') (%) CO chemisorption (m21gC~) (mz)g~u) 6 140.0 8.4(8.0) - 336 41 12 118.5 14.2(13.6) - 286 47 24 52.4 12.6(12.5) 6.7 248 65 48 27.5 13.2(12.1) 7.0 223 68 60 16.5 9.9(8.7) 7.5 162 86 72 13.3 9.5(9.3) 8.0 171 80 96 7.6 7.3(7.6) 8.1 49 85 'Calculated from the X-ray line broadening.The values in parentheses indicate copper surface area determined using the NZO reactive frontal chromatographic method.

Therefore, it can be concluded that reactivity of the well dispersed small copper particle is about the same as that of large bulk copper, and that the dehydrogenation reaction occurs mainly over Cu . 4. Conclusion Copper catalysts dispersed on silica support were prepared by precipitation for possible application in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. It was found that the catalysts exhibited a better performance than either Cu-MgO or Cu-ZnO catalysts as far as catalytic activity, selectivity and sintering resistance are concerned. The optimum precipitation conditions were found to be as follows: a precipitation temperature of 90 C, a precipitation time of 4 h and a final solution pH higher than 9. Acidic sites of the support were neutralized in the high solution pH. Acidic sites of the support were responsible for the formation of cyclohexene, and basic sites produced high-order dimerized products. The lowest loading was desirable to achieve the highest conversion, but the formation of side products was suppressed when the copper loading on the alkali-treated silica was kept above 12%. It is concluded that catalyst prepared with the above optimum conditions has highly dispersed metallic copper particles stabilized on a neutralized silica surface.
