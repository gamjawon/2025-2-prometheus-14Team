Their catalytic properties were tested in skeletal reactions of n-hexane. The Pt 4f XPS peaks show that Pt is predominantly in the metallic state after the treatments.

The growth of the O Is intensity after sulfidation can partly be attributed to the sulfate component. C 1 s shows, as a rule, residual carbon in low amounts on sulfided samples. The S 2p band shows 4-8 at.-% S with respect to the total surface in two valence states: sulfate and sulfide, the latter including also minor amounts of organic sulfur which could arise from the sulfidation of hydrocarbonaceous residues. UPS demonstrated chemical Pt-S interaction even after O2/H2 regeneration when the Fermi-edge Pt intensity rose to a height almost equal to that of a regenerated sulfur-free Pt. ISS shows that sulfur -- as opposed to carbon and oxygen -- is a surface component. Sputtering effect of He+ ions used in ISS can remove sulfate while a large part of sulfide is removed during O2/H2 regeneration and/or during n-hexane test runs. Both sulfidation and carbonization strongly decrease the overall catalytic activity. The selectivity of Pt with S present mainly as sulfate was similar to that of carbonized Pt, mainly producing hexenes. Pt mainly containing sulfide, produced initially mainly methylcyclopentane, as reported also for the sulfided single crystal catalyst.

We believe that sulfide acts mainly as a bonding modifier whereas sulfate can be a structural modifier influencing the selectivity similarly as coke or coke precursors.

It has been a common practice to add sulfur to commercial naphtha reforming catalysts in order to suppress their excessive fragmentation activity [3]. Counter claims can be found in the literature concerning the amount, chemical state, reversibility and exact effect of sulfur on various Pt catalysts. This is partly due to the differences in (i) the catalysts (single crystals to supported ones), (ii) ways of sulfur introduction and (iii) the conditions of catalyst testing (e.g., the tempera- ture or the probe molecule applied). Both 'reversibly' and 'irreversibly' adsorbed sulfur were necessary with Pt/A1203 to suppress hydrogenolysis in reforming model hydrocarbons at 773 K, whereas irreversible sulfur alone was sufficient to do this with Pt-Re/A1203 [4]. Pt, Ir and Pt-Ir supported on A1203 or SiO2 retained about 10% of their original activity when about 50% of their surface was covered by sulfur. At the same time, various reactions were affected in a different way: hydrogenolysis and aromatization were markedly suppressed (50-100-fold drop) whereas C5- cyclization showed a 5- to 10-fold decrease only [5]. Electron acceptor sulfur could change the bond strength of reactive hydrocar- bon intermediates when the reaction took place in the vicinity of metal-sulfur ensembles [2,6,7], as opposed, e.g., to electron donor Cu [6]. UV-visible spectroscopy pointed to the presence of polysulfides and/or neutral sulfur when a Pt electrode was sulfided with H2S in an aqueous medium. These spectro- scopic results could not exclude the presence of the Pt sulfide [7]. Sulfur induced surface rearrangement of Pt single crystals [8]. Adding sulfur to a Pt(111) single crystal containing 1 monolayer Re suppressed hexane hydrogenolysis by 5-10 times. At the same time, methylcyclopentane became the main product, and the TOF of its formation went up by a factor 2.5 [9]. No assumptions were proposed as for the valence state of surface sulfur. An H35S radiotracer was used to study the behaviour of sulfur (retention and removal with H2 as well as its exchange with inactive H2S/H2, respectively) over various supported Pt catalysts. The amount of S uptake increased in the order Pt/A1203 < Pt-Re/A1203 < Re/A1203. Pt/A1203 lost most sulfur in hydrogen at 623 K; the highest amount of exchange, in turn, was observed over PtRe/A1203 [10]. Presulfidation resulted in a higher catalyst resistance against coking in reforming of n-hexane and methylcyclopentane at low pressure (ca. 1 atm) where otherwise self-poisoning was strong [11]. Sulfur could displace coke Z Pall et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 113-132 115 precursors from Pt-Re/A1203 in these low pressure runs, contributing to the stability of catalytic activity [10]. The effect of sulfur on the Pt/Re/A1203 catalyst was interpreted by forming stable and catalytically inactive ReSx islands dividing thus the Pt-Re surface into small Pt ensembles [12]. The Cs-cyclization rate remained unchanged. Adding sulfur suppressed 'skeletal' reactions that required larger Pt ensembles [13]. With much S present, the catalyst retained its hydrogenation-dehydrogena- tion activity only [14]. Aromatization selectivity dropped more pronouncedly upon sulfurization in the presence of K in Pt/SiO2. The selectivity (and, with low amount of sulfur, even the yield) of methylcyclopentane (MCP) from n-hexane increased upon sulfur addition [15]. Re-S ensembles on single crystal surfaces possessed no catalytic activity and served as a diluent for Pt [14]. Accordingly, sulfur behaved as a structure blocker. An analogous effect of sulfur was proposed in butadiene hydrogenation over Pt single crystals [16]. At the same time, the ability of sulfur to block sites for hydrogen dissociation was pointed out. Sulfur adsorbed on Pt was removed easily during hydrocarbon reactions; Re, in turn, stabilized S on the surface [14]. An analogous effect of sulfur was proposed in butadiene hydrogenation over Pt single crystals [16]. At the same time, the ability of sulfur to block sites for hydrogen dissociation was pointed out. One of the possible reasons for sulfur removal (in addition to desorption at high temperature and reaction with gaseous H2 to give H2S [10]) was found to be its reaction with surface hydrocarbon intermediates [17]. The remaining small Pt ensembles in sulfided Pt were more resistant to poisoning by carbon deposition. The pattern of activity change was comparable to the experience observed with gradual deactivation of Pt/SiO2 by carbona- ceous deposits [18] or inactive metal additives like Cu [19]. Rather diverse surface chemical methods were used for studying sulfided Pt catalysts [7,9,14,16,20]. Earlier we combined XPS and UPS characterization of Pt black with catalytic studies using n-hexane test reactions [21,22]. XPS showed the presence of residual oxygen and carbon in various chemical forms even after O2/H2 treatment [23,24] while UPS of samples regenerated this way gave intense Pt metal signals. The present study applies a similar technique to an artificially sulfided (or sulfurized) Pt black catalyst. Using this sample permitted us to follow the XPS signal of Pt without any interfering effect from the support [25,26], thus eliminating the difficulty of exact determination of binding energy (BE) maxima for sulfided or oxidized supported Pt [26]. UPS and ISS could also be used. Catalytic test reactions were carded out ex-situ. Our aim was to obtain as much information as possible about the amount and state of S added to Pt catalysts and correlate the catalytic properties with this information. These results were compared with those obtained with a Pt-black sample containing hydrocarbona- ceous deposits ('coke' or 'coke precursors') accumulated during a lengthy contact of Pt with the n-hexane reactant [27-29]. 116 Z Padl et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 113-132 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Pt black was reduced with aqueous hydrazine hydrate [22] (cf. PtN in Ref. [23]) and sintered at 633 K in H2 according to a standard thermal cycle (STC, [30]). Code: PtN-STC. 2.2. Catalyst pretreatments 2.2.1. Sulfidation (I) A Pt black sample was kept in circulating H2 (100 Torr) at 633 K for 1 h. After evacuation, a 10% HeS in H2 (P= 520 Torr) was introduced and circulated for 45 min, then evacuated for 10 min and cooled in vacuum to 300 K. Surface characterization of the sulfided sample was carried out after sulfida- tion (Code: PtN-S/I) and after a few months, code: PtN-S/I/2. Two other derivatives of PtN-S/I/2 were also measured. One sample was used in a catalytic run of 50 min, with a mixture of 10 Torr n-hexane and 120 Torr H2, code PtN-S/I/2A. Another sample was subjected to six runs of 5 min with 10 Torr n-hexane and H2 of 60 to 480 Torr and one run of 50 min, nil: H2 --- 10:120 Torr with a total of 7 regenerations between runs (02, H2, see under 'Catalytic runs'), code: PtN-S/I/2B. Both these samples were trans- ferred from the catalytic reactor to the UHV apparatus. (II). Another Pt-black sample was heated to 673 K in He, then sulfided with 6% HiS in H2 flow at 673 K for 2 h, kept in He for a further 2 h at 673 K and cooled in He flow. Code: PtN-S/II. This catalyst was subjected to different treatments between measurements and afterwards transferred from the UHV apparatus to the catalytic reactor. Results obtained with samples PtN-S/I and PtN-S/II are complementary to each other. Its importance will be emphasized later. 2.2.2. Carbonization A mixture of 40 Torr n-hexane and 60 Torr H2 was reacted at 603 K for 100 min on a Pt black sample which was then characterized parallel with PtN-S/II. Code of the carbonized sample is PtN-C. 2.3. Catalyst characterization A Leybold LHS 12 MCD instrument equipped with X-ray and UV source and with a hemispherical analyzer was used [21-24]. The catalyst samples could be regenerated without taking them out of the UHV apparatus (600 K, 10 mbar 02 and 267 mbar H2 [21,22]). For XPS, Mg Ka or A1 Ka radiation (1253.6 and 1486.6 eV, respectively) was applied for excitation. O Is, C ls, S 2p and Pt 4f Z Pall et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 113-132 117 lines were monitored with a pass energy of 108 eV. Survey spectra showed no presence of additional components worth mentioning. Data processing involved satellite subtraction, Shirley background subtraction and integration, by means of the program SciPlot (copyright M. Wesemann, Fritz-Haber-Institute). The concentration of the elements present was determined by using sensitivity factors published in the literature [31]. ISS was carried out with He+ ions of 1 keV under quasi-static conditions. UPS spectra excited by He I radiation (21.2 eV; pass energy, 12 eV) were recorded [21,23,24]. 2.4. Catalytic runs A closed circulation loop was filled with a mixture of 10 Torr n-hexane and hydrogen of varying pressure (60 to 480 Torr) and reacted at 603 K as reported earlier in detail [21,22]. Gas chromatography (a 50 m CP-SIL quartz capillary) was used for analysis. The catalytic activity was restored between runs by treating the catalyst with 02, and, after evacuation, with H2 at 603 K. 3. Results 3.1. ISS The regions of Pt, S, and O could be evaluated in the semiquantitative surface-sensitive ISS measurements [32]; the C region at lower kinetic energies was poorly separated from the high background. Results of ISS scans of sulfurized (PtN-S/II) and carbonized (PtN-C) catalysts are shown in Fig. la and b. In addition to probing the composition at the very surface, the impinging He ions during repeated scans provided a surface purification (mild sputtering) effect [32]. Therefore, the Pt signal increased markedly during subsequent scans. No pronounced changes were seen in the oxygen region whereas the intensity of sulfur signal decreased. The removal of surface impurities by ion sputtering is in good agreement with XPS results (see Figs. 4-7). Samples of the PtN-S/I family gave identical ISS results, both before and after n-hexane reactions. 3.2. XPS 3.2.1. Composition and valence states of sulfided and unsulfided Pt samples The composition of the original Pt black and its sulfided counterparts was determined by XPS (Table 1). In agreement with earlier results, about 50-60% of the surface signal originated from Pt. In-situ regeneration increased the Pt percentage but even the regenerated catalysts contained a marked amount of residual oxygen and carbon. (That residual gases were not the only or even the main source of carbon is shown by the fact that its amount could be reduced to 118 Z.

Reacting hydrocarbons brought about a considerable accumulation of surface carbon on unsulfided Pt (PtN 'after reaction' [22]). Much less carbon accumulated over sulfided Pt (PtN-S/I /2A and 2B) as expected on the basis of earlier reports [2,6,7]. Two sulfur peaks appeared with PtN-S/I (Fig. 3). The peak at ca. 162 eV Z.

The sulfate component remained in majority in samples 2 and 2A, the latter containing somewhat less S2-. Sample 2B contacted with n-hexane in several runs and regenerating O2/H2 treatments in-between lost much sulfur, in agree- ment with results obtained with test reactions of n-hexane isomerization [14] and butadiene hydrogenation [17]. In our case, these treatments mainly removed the 'sulfide' component causing a very marked change of the chemical state of sulfur during the transition from sample PtN-S/I to samples PtN-S/I/2A and 2B. 3.2.2. Comparison of carbonized and sulfurized Pt blacks Sulfidation at higher temperature and in a flow system resulted in the accumulation of about twice as much sulfur in sample PtN-S/II. This hap- pened at the expense of O and C impurities, the exposed Pt surface (54%) being not lower (Table 3). ISS treatment decreased the amount of residual sulfur (cf. Fig. 1) with its further decrease upon 02, H2 regeneration. The Pt purity in PtN-C was similar to that observed after analogous treatments of PtN-S/II; note the increase of O Is signal after 02, H2 regeneration of Pt-C as reported earlier [24]. The direct graphical comparison of individual regions of sulfurized and carbonized Pt blacks (samples PtN-S/II and Pt-C) provided supplementary information. The expected BE maxima of individual components [23] is shown in Figs. 4-7. A rather even distribution of O ls components is seen in samples without treatment and subjected to ISS, with more oxygen in the sulfided than in carbonized Pt (Fig. 4). A marked difference appeared after in-situ regeneration. The excess O Is intensity in sulfided samples could be attributed to the presence of sulfate (BE maxima at 531.8-532.5 eV [34,35]). The O is peak shape after regeneration differed markedly from that of Pt-C: in the latter case a marked intensity increase appeared in the PtO region. This is in agreement with our earlier observation that a high-temperature oxygen treatment can increase the 122 Z.

The presence of sulfur prevented the formation of surface 'PtO' (surface oxide or chemisorbed O). The higher amount of carbon in PtN-C 'as is' (Fig. 5) corresponds to expectation. The carbon content of PtN-S/II must have been there before sulfidation, since the presence of S prevents polymer carbon formation [2], as indicated by the lower intensity of C ls peak. ISS removed much carbon from both catalysts indicating that a part of C is present as an overlayer (apart from intrinsic C shown by ISS -- Fig. la and b). The carbon signal increased after regeneration, to a higher extent with PtN-S/II. The shape of the C ls line after Oe/H2 treatment indicated mainly a graphitic component and hardly any oxidized C in both cases. This may mean that, in addition to carbon removal, this chemical treatment induced also an aggregation of carbonaceous deposits into three-dimensional overlayers (transformation of C x H), entities into graphite) [231. As opposed to the PtN-S/I family, the fraction of 'sulfide' component in the S 2p region was much higher in the PtN-S/II sample (Fig. 6). The broad Z.

The spectra are shifted in vertical direction. peak corresponding to S\"+ indicates the likely presence of S in more than one oxidation state (BE for $4+: ca. 166 eV [34,36]). Owing to the poorly defined shape of the S\"region, quantitative determination of S components was not attempted. ISS removed most of the sulfate component, leaving 'sulfide' almost unchanged. Regeneration decreased markedly the 'sulfide' intensity, with the reappearance of a low intensity broad band in the S\"+ region. Sulfur (BE ca. 164 eV [36]) and organic sulfur compounds (BE ca. 163.4-164.2 eV [34]) were possibly also present, as reported earlier [7]. They appear as a shoulder in the upper two spectra. Their amount was nearly equal to sulfide after regeneration (Fig. 6). These could arise from the interaction of H2S with carbonaceous deposits. The BE maxima of the Pt 4f 7//2 lines after each treatment (Fig. 7) agree well with that reported for clean metallic Pt [22,23]. The difference spectra between PtN-S/II and PtN-C after identical treatments are also shown. The Pt 4f intensity of PtN-S/II was higher in all cases than that of PtN-C; however, the position of the maximum with 'as received' samples (case 1, Fig. 7) does not agree with the BE maximum of metallic Pt.

The spectra are shifted in vertical direction. difference spectrum (ABE = 0.6 eV) is in agreement with [39] but is less than that corresponding to Pt sulfide (ABE = 1.2 eV). This points to adsorbed sulfide overlayer in weak electronic interaction with Pt. A shift with indistinct BE maximum is seen after ISS. It disappears after regeneration, indicating that the small amount of residual sulfide (Fig. 6, Table 3) exerts a minor electronic influence on the main component, metallic Pt (See Section 3.3). 3.3. UPS He I UP spectra of sulfided and carbonized Pt blacks, after hydrocarbon reactions (Fig. 8) show low Fermi-edge intensities; that of PtN-S/II, although weak, was higher than that for PtN-C. This means that a small fraction of the surface was in the state of metallic Pt. One very broad maximum centered around 7 eV is seen with PtN-C. This is typical of a Pt-C system [23,40]. The strongest feature of the sulfided PtN-S/II sample was a peak centered around 6-6.5 eV, attributed to bonding S 3p states [41]. The maximum at ca. 2 eV due to metal states localized by the sulfur adsorbate [41] was less marked and Z.

The lower amount of sulfur in PtN-S/1/2 produced a weaker band at ca. 6.5 eV (Fig. 9). The loss of finer features in the spectra of PtN-S/I/2A and 2B points to a gradual displacement of some sulfur by carbon; the shape of the broad band of carbon points to sulfur hindering aggregation of carbon to an overlayer, although the C ls concentrations of PtN-S/I/2A and PtN-C were similar (Table 1). Regeneration of carbonized (PtN-C), and sulfided (PtN-S/II) samples produced spectra characteristic of rather clean Pt [23] with high Fermi-edge intensity and showing the typical Pt structure between BE = 0-4.5 eV (Fig. 10). The UP spectra after ISS treatment are similar to those shown in Fig. 10. Small features of adsorbed OH and/or H20 appear at ca. 7.5 and 11 eV [23,42,43] on regenerated PtN-C. The maximum in the difference spectrum at ca. 6.2 eV (together with an indistinct feature at ca. 2 eV), points to a still active chemical Pt-S interaction. This explains the lower Fermi-edge intensity in regenerated PtN-S/II, in spite of its Pt 4f signal being larger (Table 3) than that of unsulfided Pt. 3.4. Catalytic properties n-Hexane gives fragments, skeletal isomers, methylcyclopentane (MCP), benzene as well as olefins over Pt black at 600 K [13,21,22,33]. Their selectivity strongly depends on the hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio in the feed which can influence the coverage of the catalyst by hydrocarbonaceous species during run. Similar pattern was found on EUROPT-1 [18]. Table 4 compares the activity and selectivity of Pt-STC with that of sulfurized Pt (PtN-S/I) containing the residual sulfur predominantly in the Z.

Aromatization stopped entirely and the main products were hexenes with minor fragmentation, isomerization and MCP formation. A few regenerations and lengthy use of the catalyst in n-hexane reactions removed most sulfur in the S2- (or organic sulfur) state (Fig. 2, Table 1). At the same time, its overall activity increased; however, benzene and fragment selectivities remained still well below their original values. Hexene selectivity also dropped back to low values. Isomerization and C5-cyclization selectivities even increased. This was roughly what one could expect from literature reports [5,44]. Different changes were observed in the case of sample PtN-S/II containing the residual sulfur predominantly in the sulfide state.

Unsulfided Pt black, PtN-STC shows no particular selectivity changes during run (Fig. 1 la). The activity after sulfidation (i.e., with sample PtN-S/II) dropped drastically, like with PtN-S/I (Table 4). However, methylcyclopentane formation showed by far highest initial selec- tivity (Fig. 1 lb). This diminished rapidly during a longer run, although the MCP selectivity was still higher, and that of olefins lower than those reported in Table 4. No benzene and isomers were produced. Regeneration (Fig. l lc) restored activity only partially (cf. the abscissa scales). The benzene and fragment selectivities reached the values shown in Table 4, the values and MCP were, in turn, higher. Gradual carbonization of EUROPT-I suppressed first isomerization to give more MCP; olefins were the main products on after massive carbonization [18].

It confirms what was said beforehand: deactivation by carbonized residues hampers first of all isomerization and enhances olefin selectivity. The activity of this catalyst can be fully restored. Benzene formation is totally deactivated upon sulfidation (both with sulfate and sulfide) and neither the activity nor benzene and fragment selectivity can be restored. 4. Discussion Additives to catalysts (promoters and poisons) can be classified as structural and bonding modifiers [45]. The former class occupies certain sites poisoning selectively, e.g., reactions requiring multi-atom ensembles, while bonding modi- fiers alter the bond strength between reactant and catalyst enhancing or hinder- ing thus certain reaction pathways. Barbier and co-workers [2,6,7] argued that electronic effects rather than a structural modifying action were important. Somorjai and co-workers [8,9], in turn, emphasized the structural modifier effect of sulfur. Oudar et al. [16] reported no electronic sulfur effect in butadiene hydrogenation over Pt single crystal surfaces but found a slight promoting effect of low sulfur coverages for H2-D2 exchange [20] which had no influence on the butadiene hydrogenation reaction. We found [13,18] that carbonaceous residues (or their precursors) poison first of all multi-atom ensembles, leaving open reaction routes that can take place on single sites [13,19,46]. Thus, first of all, the formation of isomers is hindered from the C5 cyclic surface intermediate, afterwards Cs-cyclization will also be suppressed. Fragmentation is related to these reactions while benzene formation is hampered or promoted independently of the other processes [18]. After an advanced carbonization, combined 'PtC' sites are left and these single sites are active in dehydrogenation to hexenes only [18,46]. Hence carbon can be classified as a structural modifier. Apart from the overlayer-type surface car- bonaceous deposits, carbon (as well as oxygen) should be an integral component of the agglomerates of Pt crystallites situated along cracks, interfaces or in 130 Z. Padl et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 113-132 subsurface layers likely as 'coke precursors' rather than a polymerized material [231. ISS and UPS studies confirmed that sulfur, in turn, stayed mainly on the outer surface of Pt. Sulfur is present in two valence states. The S 2p peak at ca. 162 eV BE points to sulfide entities (perhaps together with some elementary sulfur). The formation of a Pt-S chemical bond is evidenced also by the peak at ca. 6.5 eV in the UP spectra. This latter feature remained even when most S is removed (Fig. 10). The residual sulfur must be in a chemisorbed state, i.e., S atoms interacting chemically with Pt atoms. The sulfide fraction should be responsible for suppressing benzene formation. Under certain conditions it can enhance Cs-cyclization (Fig. 1 lb). Since MCP formation is also thought to involve sites with more than one Pt atom [13], we regard that sulfide acts first of all as a bonding modifier poisoning selectively aromatization and promoting Cs-cycliza- tion. The same effect should have been responsible for enhanced MCP forma- tion on single crystal surfaces, too [9]. Possible explanations suggested for the enhanced electronic effect of surface S entities (producing unexpectedly large work function changes) included the assumption of PtSH species or a charge transfer form adsorbed H to surface S [47]. Both hypotheses are in agreement with the presence of sulfide entities suggested on the basis of the present experiments. If S would also stabilize surface hydrogen, this could explain the selectivity shift benzene ~ methylcyclopentane which is related to the avail- ability of hydrogen on Pt [13,18,21]. When S is present mainly as sulfate (e.g., sample PtN-S/I/2B, Table 4) -- or as sulfur -- the reactions requiring multi-atomic sites (hydrogenolysis and aromatization) show lower selectivities, two-atom sites for Cs-cyclic reactions [13,18,21] were less affected but the selectivity of dehydrogenation on single sites increased (Table 4). These types of sulfur act, likely, as a structural modifier or site blocker. Thus, although the negative charge of the sulfate group is certainly present, the geometric effects of bulky sulfate groups should prevail. These results can resolve the apparent contradiction on the possible way of action of sulfur poison [6-9,14-17]. Sulfur can act both as structural and bonding modifier. Structural poisoning can be attributed to oxidized (sulfate-like) or adsorbed (elementary) sulfur with weak Pt-S electronic interaction, whereas sulfide can be regarded as a bonding modifier poison. Most of the sulfide species is easily removed by chemical treatment (oxygen-hydrogen regeneration and/or by their interaction with reacting sur- face hydrocarbon intermediates [16,17]). This latter process, however, does not increase the amount of the organic sulfur but may increase its fraction (Fig. 6). Sulfate entities, in turn, can be removed by mechanical action of impinging He + ions. This may offer a possible explanation of the difference between 'reversi- bly' and 'irreversibly' adsorbed S [4]. The former may tentatively be identified as sulfide, whereas S oxidized even by oxygen traces to sulfate resists customary chemical treatment of Pt catalysts. Oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during Z. Padl et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 113-132 131 regeneration was seen in Fig. 4. This may be one of the reasons why the original activity was hard to restore (Table 5). The stable sulfate species on Pt may have a certain similarity with stable ReS species containing 'irreversibly' adsorbed S [4,10-12,14]. One should remember that PtS is thermodynamically unstable in the presence of H2 [39,48]. That may explain the rather rapid loss of S from Pt observed also with Pt foil [14] and supported Pt [10,49]. Sulfur seems to compete for surface sites where accumulation of carbon could have occurred, hence less carbon accumulated over sulfided Pt (Tables 1 and 3). It is an open question to what extent a mutual displacement of sulfur and other surface entities took place. Some of the excess oxygen sulfurized Pt could have belonged to the sulfate groups (Fig. 4). This might point to the competition between OH entities and sulfate as was shown in aqueous solution by combined electrochemical and radiotracer studies [50]. Another consequence of this com- petition may be the prevention of the formation of surface Pt oxide upon regeneration in the presence of residual sulfur (Fig. 4). The chemical character of the Pt-S and Pt-O interaction must be similar: bonding O 2p orbitals in a PtOaas system gave a band at ca. 6 eV [51,52] like the S 3p orbitals in PtSads, with more intense 'additional electronic structures' on PtS than with PtO [41]. Even a low amount of sulfur gave rise to a noticeable intensity drop at the Fermi-edge (Fig. 10). This feature is characteristic of localized t2g electrons of Pt active in chemisorption bond formation [52]. Spectroscopic results comparing the PtO and PtS systems will be published separately.

Pt black samples in a fresh state, deactivated by coking and treated with H2S were studied with electron spectroscopy. Their catalytic properties were tested in skeletal reactions of n-hexane. The Pt 4f XPS peaks show that Pt is predominantly in the metallic state after the treatments. After sulfidation, a minor amount of PtS can be detected in the difference spectrum (Pt unsulfided - Pt sulfided) only. The growth of the O 1s intensity after sulfidation can partly be attributed to the sulfate component. C 1s shows, as a rule, residual carbon in low amounts on sulfided samples. The S 2p band shows 4–8 at.-% S with respect to the total surface in two valence states: sulfate and sulfide, the latter including also minor amounts of organic sulfur which could arise from the sulfidation of hydrocarbonaceous residues. UPS demonstrated chemical Pt—S interaction even after O2/H2 regeneration when the Fermi-edge Pt intensity rose to a height almost equal to that of a regenerated sulfur-free Pt. ISS shows that sulfur — as opposed to carbon and oxygen — is a surface component. Sputtering effect of He+ ions used in ISS can remove sulfate while a large part of sulfide is removed during O2/H2 regeneration and/or during n-hexane test runs. Both sulfidation and carbonization strongly decrease the overall catalytic activity. The selectivity of Pt with S present mainly as sulfate was similar to that of carbonized Pt, mainly producing hexenes. Pt mainly containing sulfide, produced initially mainly methylcyclopentane, as reported also for the sulfided single crystal catalyst. Carbonized Pt could be fully regenerated by O2/H2 treatment at 600 K but the same treatment — even repeated — restored the overall activity of a sulfided Pt only partially. We believe that sulfide acts mainly as a bonding modifier whereas sulfate can be a structural modifier influencing the selectivity similarly as coke or coke precursors.
