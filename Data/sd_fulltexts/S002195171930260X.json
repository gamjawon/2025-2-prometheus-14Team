Graphical abstract In this work, the key OO bond formation step in water oxidation catalyzed by a polyoxometalate-based complex [Mn3(H2O)3(SbW9O33)2]12− was theoretically investigated. The MnV-oxo species rather than MnIV-oxo species, is computed to be responsible for OO bond formation via water nucleophilic attack mechanism. During OO bond formation based on MnV-oxo species, two-state reactivity is found and the energy profile switches from the 13et state to the 15et state through a minimum energy crossing point, which significantly reduces the activation barrier. The observed spin inversion phenomenon in OO bond formation is attributed to the exchange-enhanced reactivity for 15et state, but not for 13et state. Keywords DFT Water oxidation catalysis OO bond formation Two-state reactivity Polyoxometalate Water splitting into oxygen and hydrogen molecules is a promising strategy for converting renewable energy into chemical fuels. Given high overpotential demand and expensive thermodynamic cost, the water oxidation half-reaction (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) is considered to be bottleneck of water splitting [1]. Therefore, the development of efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is indispensable for constructing a promising strategy to alleviate the growing energy demand [2]. To date, a great amount of complexes based on transition-metal (TM) have been reported as efficient WOCs, especially organometallic complexes [3]. However, the organometallic WOCs undergo the drawback of being deactivated since they are unstable under harsh reaction conditions [4]. It is extremely urgent to design and synthesize robust WOC with high stability. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been recognized as one of the promising inorganic ligands for designing and synthesizing WOCs with excellent catalytic performance and strong stability [5]. In recent years, many POM-derivatives based on Ru, Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, Cu have been explored as excellent WOCs [6], such as [{Ru4(μ-O)4(μ-OH)2(H2O)4}(γ-SiW10O36)2]10− (Ru4POM) [7], [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (Co4POM) [8], [Ni5(OH)6(OH2)3(Si2W18O66)]12− [9], [MnIII 3MnIVO3(CH3COO)3(A-α-SiW9O34)]6− [10], [Fe11(H2O)14(OH)2(W3O10)2(α-SbW9O33)6]27− [11], [CuII 3(H2O)3(SbW9O33)2]12− [12]. In 2017, Ding and co-workers have reported the first Mn containing POM-based WOC [MnII 3(H2O)3(SbW9O33)2]12− ([POM-MnII-OH2]12−, 1, shown in Fig. 1 ) which catalyzed water oxidation reaction under photochemical condition (LED lamp/[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2/Na2S2O8) [13]. The 1 consists of a MnII 3 core that is capped by two trivacant Keggin-type polyanions [SbW9O33]9−. Each MnII center is surrounded by four O atoms from [SbW9O33]9− and one water as the fifth ligand. That is, three Mn centers of 1 are equally reactive sites and locate in the identical chemical environment, which is different from the famous Ru4POM and Co4POM in which the ligand assembly for each metal center (Co, Ru) is not entirely same [7,8]. For catalytic mechanism of Ru4POM and Co4POM toward water oxidation, the Bonchio and Poblet groups have provided the atomistic level understanding by using density functional theory [14,15]. However, the mechanism details mediated by 1, especially the OO bond formation that is generally considered as key step in water oxidation catalysis [16], is still remain unknown. Hence in-depth mechanistic studies of OO bond formation are required to provide more valuable information for further designing of efficient WOCs. We herein study in detail the OO bond formation in water oxidation catalyzed by 1 using computational techniques at B3LYP/PCM level (details are described in SI) [17,18]. Firstly, two possible electronic configurations, high-spin with 15 unpaired electrons (five per MnII-center) and low-spin with 9 unpaired electrons (three per MnII-center), were computed to identify the ground state of 1. DFT calculations suggest that the high-spin state for 1 is much more stable than the low-spin state by 118.4 kcal mol−1. In 16et 1 (16 1), the average distance among three Mn centers is as long as 5.18 Å, indicating the weak interactions among Mn centers. Therefore, to simplify the calculation, we have selected only one Mn reactive site to theoretically investigate the catalytic mechanism (see SI for details) and the other two Mn centers were kept in high-spin d5 electron configurations during the catalytic cycles [14,15,19,20]. In general, two types of OO bond formation mechanism have been proposed for water oxidation catalysis [16]. One mechanism involves OO coupling between two metal-oxo/metal-oxyl species. Another mechanism proceeds via nucleophilic attack of water molecule on metal-oxo or metal-oxyl species. In view of bulkiness and structural stability of POM-based WOCs, the intermolecular OO coupling mechanism can be excluded [14.15,21]. In 16 1, the distance between two O atoms from two H2O ligands is as long as 9.11 Å, indicating that the intramolecular OO coupling mechanism is impossible. Therefore, OO bond formation was proposed to proceed via water nucleophilic attack (WNA) mechanism in present work. Scheme 1 presents the catalytic cycle of water oxidation by 1. The mechanism starting with the deprotonation of water ligand and oxidation of MnII to generate the MnIII-OH species [POM-MnIII-OH]12− (2). The MnIII center in 2 is identified to be more favorable in high-spin d4 electronic configuration (see SI for details). The continuous oxidation event proceeds via two possible pathways to obtain 3 with two different electronic configurations [16]. For one possible pathway, one hydrogen is removed from OH ligand and an O radical is left, forming a MnIII-oxyl species [POM-MnIII-O ]12− with total spin-multiplicity (SM) of 16 (16 3). Alternatively, the oxidation occurs on MnIII along with the deprotonation of OH ligand to achieve [POM-MnIV = O]12− with SM of 14 (14 3). Consistently, the calculated spin population on MnIII and oxyl centers for 16 3 are 3.7 |e| and 1.1 |e|, respectively. In 14 3, the spin populations of 2.6 |e| on MnIV center and 0.3 |e| on oxo center are observed. In addition, the computational results suggest that 14 3 is more stable than 16 3 by 15.3 kcal mol−1. Firstly, 14 3 acts as the reactive species for OO bond formation through WNA mechanism. However, the energy barrier is computed to be 38.6 kcal mol−1, which is too high to be overcome under the photochemical condition (see SI for details). Alternatively, the 3 may undergo a further oxidation with potential of −0.42 V vs. SCE, forming 4. The 4 could also be described as a MnIV-oxyl radical species [POM-MnIV-O ]11− in SM = 15 (15 4) or a MnV-oxo species [POM-MnV = O]11− in SM = 13 (13 4). Accordingly, the calculated spin populations on MnIV and oxyl centers for 15 4 are 2.6 |e| and 0.9 |e|, respectively. For 13 4, the spin populations on MnV and oxo centers are 2.0 |e| and 0.1 |e|. The 13 4 is more stable than 15 4 by 7.4 kcal mol−1. The energy profiles of OO bond formation based on 4 are represented in Fig. 2 . One water molecule attacks to 13 4 for generating the 13et hydroperoxo species [POM-MnIII-OOH···H]11− (13 5), in which OO bond is formed and one proton from the incoming water is concertedly transferred to one terminal O atom (Ot) of POM-ligand (see SI for details). The energy barrier for this step (13 4 → 13 5) is as high as 29.3 kcal mol−1. It is worth noting that the 15et state 5 (15 5) in energy is much lower than that of 13 5 by 16.7 kcal mol−1. Interestingly, the transition state (15 TS) based on 15 4 locates above 15 4 + H2O by 13.8 kcal mol−1, which is significantly lowered respect to the energy barrier for 13 4 → 13 5. Thus it proposes that the energy profile for OO bond formation based on 4 would switch from the 13et state to the 15et state through a minimum energy crossing point (13 4 → 15 TS → 15 5). Spin inversion between 13et and 15et potential energy surface (PES) is observed, which is recognized as two-state reactivity (TSR) [22]. The lowest energy barrier for OO bond formation based on 4 is computed to be only 21.2 kcal mol−1, and consequently promotes the occurrence of the reaction. To gain deep insight into the mechanism, the molecular orbitals of the reactive species involved in OO bond formation are analyzed. During OO bond formation, two electrons of the incoming water molecule are transferred to 14 3/13 4. As shown in Fig. 3 , the α spin lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (α-LUMO) of 13 4 has a Mn-O π*-antibonding character and is significantly polarized toward to O ligand. Therefore, α-LUMO of 13 4 could compatibly interact with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of water molecule to promote electrons transfer from water molecule to 13 4 and thus OO bond formation [14–16,23]. For 14 3, the candidate orbital to interact with the HOMO of water molecule is α-LUMO + 1 that has a significant contribution from O ligand. However, the energy gap between α-LUMO + 1 of 14 3 and HOMO of water molecule was calculated to be 6.20 eV which is obviously larger than the case in 13 4 (Eg = 1.78 eV). Therefore, the high energy-demanding TS for OO bond formation based on 14 3 should be partly attributed to the large energy difference between the electron acceptor orbital of 14 3 and HOMO of water molecule. In order to illuminate the origin of spin inversion phenomenon, the electron rearrangements for reactive Mn center and its reactive O ligand during OO bond formation based on 15 4 and 13 4 are analyzed, and the results are shown in Scheme 2 . For OO bond formation based on 15 4, the number of unpaired electrons on reactive Mn center increases from three to four as the reaction proceeds. Therefore, the corresponding 15 TS would be stabilized by a new exchange interaction [24]. Hence, the reaction based on 15 4 is characterized with exchange-enhanced reactivity (EER), which reduces the barriers of the reaction that shows the increase of unpaired electrons on the TM center in the TS [24,25]. However, the EER is not observed for the reaction based on 13 4 since the unpaired electrons on reactive Mn center keep unchanged at 2 during OO bond formation. Thus the corresponding barrier for 13 4 is as high as expected. Therefore, the favorable EER for OO bond formation by 15 4, but not by 13 4, should be responsible for the observed spin inversion phenomenon, which significantly reduces the activation barrier. In conclusion, the key OO bond formation step in water oxidation catalyzed by a POM-based complex [POM-MnII-OH2]12− has been theoretically disclosed. The MnV-oxo species [POM-MnV = O]11− rather than MnIV-oxo species [POM-MnIV = O]12−, that are derived from [POM-MnII-OH2]12− by a series of electrons and protons transfers, was proposed to be capable of OO bond formation via WNA mechanism. Compared with [POM-MnV = O]11−, the poor activity of [POM-MnIV = O]12− to OO bond formation is attributed to the large energy gap between electron acceptor orbital of [POM-MnIV = O]12− and HOMO of water molecule. During OO bond formation by [POM-MnV = O]11−, TSR is found and the energy profile switches from the 13et state to the 15et state through a minimum energy crossing point, which significantly reduces the activation barrier. The EER of OO bond formation for 15et state, but not for 13et state, is responsible for the observed spin inversion phenomenon.
