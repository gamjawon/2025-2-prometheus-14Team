Graphical abstract Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) of the medium chain reductase (MDR) subfamily are valuable biocatalysts for the production of optically active alcohols and are now used routinely in industry for the preparation of synthetic intermediates. TADH from Thermus sp. ATN1 combines the advantages of both thermostability and dependence on the less expensive, non-phosphoryated, cofactor NADH as the hydride donor. The structure of TADH in complex with NADH has been determined and refined to a resolution of 2.74Å. The structure reveals structural features commensurate with known stabilising factors of thermostable MDRs, including shorter peripheral loops and an increased amount of inter- and intra-subunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds compared to mesophilic MDRs of known structure. A study of the active site reveals the molecular determinants of NADH and substrate binding in TADH that help to shed light on observed differences in cofactor specificity and stereoselectivity when compared to its thermophilic NADPH-dependent homolog from Thermoanaerobium brockii (TbADH). The structure also provides a basis for investigating the enzyme-associated deactivation of the catalyst ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+), which has been used in TADH-catalysed reactions for the recycling of the nicotinamide cofactor. Keywords Alcohol dehydrogenase Biocatalysis NADH Thermostable Oxidoreductase MDR 1 Introduction NAD(P)H-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) of the medium chain reductase (MDR) sub-family are a valuable group of oxidoreductases that have proven beneficial in industrial organic synthesis for the generation of optically active alcohols from prochiral ketones [1–3]. The MDR subfamily includes enzymes with a wide range of relevant catalytic properties, including complementary ranges of substrate spectra, stereopreference, stability to organic solvents, and thermostability. One of the most well-researched examples is horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH), which has a distinguished history in biocatalysis research [4] and has provided some of the first models of dehydrogenase activity [5] following the solution of its structure in 1974 [6]. More recently, microbial homologues of HLADH have proven more amenable to application, with recent examples including: ADH-A from Rhodococcus ruber [7–9], which has gained attention for biocatalytic processes owing to its tolerance to organic solvents; CPCR2, an ADH from Candida parapsilosis [10,11], which has been engineered for broader substrate acceptance and improved stability [12,13], and the ADH from Aeropyrum pernix [14] a hyperthermophilic MDR with (S)-selectivity for the reduction of ketone substrates [15]. Thermostable ADHs are uniquely interesting from an industrial process perspective as thermostability often equates with both mesophilic longevity and organic solvent tolerance. The thermophilic ADH from Thermoanaerobium brockii (TbADH), for example, also has a long history of application in biocatalysis [16–18], but is dependent upon the more expensive, phosphorylated, cofactor NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents in ketone reductions. The thermophilic bacterium Thermus sp. ATN1 was isolated in 2001, on the basis of its potential for the biodegradation of alkanes [19]. Amongst its catalytic repertoire was identified an MDR, named TADH (Uniprot code B2ZRE3), for which the relevant gene was cloned and expressed in the heterologous host E. coli [20]. TADH has subsequently been shown to be dependent on the cheaper, non-phosphorylated, cofactor NADH, and to reduce a range of aldehydes and cyclic alkanones including 2-pentanone 1,3-methylcyclohexanone 3 and phenylacetone 5 with (S)-selectivity (Fig. 1 ), each with excellent enantiomeric excess [21]. It has also been used for the dismutation of aldehyde substrates to both alcohol and carboxylic acid products [21]. TADH displayed thermal activity at high temperatures, even up to 100°C and also exhibited good retention of activity in organic solvents: acetone was tolerated at up to 50% concentration and in two-phase systems with hexane and octane, up to 80% activity was conserved [21]. In addition, the enzyme has been used in conjunction with rhodium catalyst pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium bipyridine ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+) 7 (Fig. 1) for the regeneration of the NADH cofactor [20,22], although the incubation of the enzyme with the rhodium complex caused inactivation of both catalysts [23]. In order to shed light on the substrate specificity and thermotolerance of TADH, and also to establish a basis for investigating the possible molecular reasons for the sensitivity of ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+) to incubation with the enzyme, we embarked on an investigation of its X-ray crystal structure. In this report, we describe the structure of TADH, refined to a resolution of 2.74Å. TADH is revealed to be a homotetrameric structure with a network of interactions including H-bonds and salt bridges, and compact surface loops, which may improve thermostability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Expression and purification of TADH The gene encoding TADH Thermus sp. ATN1 had been previously cloned into the pASZ2 (pET-11a derivative) vector [20,21] and was expressed in cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the following procedure: A single colony of freshly transformed cells was cultivated overnight in 5mL LB medium containing 100μgmL−1 ampicillin. From this a starter culture of 15mL (O.D.600 =0.5–0.6) was used to inoculate 300mL of Overnight Express Autoinduction medium (Novagen) and the cells grown for 24h at 37°C with shaking, after which they were harvested by centrifugation at 18,000× g for 15min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 80mL of 20mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5. Cell lysates were obtained using a constant cell disruption system with one cycle at a pressure of 1900Bar (20000–27000psi). The total cell extract was subjected to heat precipitation at 80°C for 20min, and the resulting suspension centrifuged 18,000× g for 30min at 4°C to yield a clear supernatant. The supernatant was concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 30kDa and the concentrated protein was then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using an AKTA FPLC (Amersham), fitted with a 16/60 Superdex 75 column. The protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20mM Tris–HCl and 300mM sodium chloride at pH 7.5. Column fractions containing TADH, as suggested by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and concentrated to 10mgmL−1, again using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10kDa. 2.2 Crystallisation of TADH TADH was subjected to crystallisation trials using a Mosquito® robot (TTP LabTech) and a range of commercially available screens in 96-well plates using 300nL drops at a range of protein concentrations. The best initial crystals were observed in drops containing 1M sodium chloride and 1.5M ammonium sulphate in 0.1M Bis–Tris buffer at pH 6.5, using a protein concentration of 2mgmL−1 and a ratio of protein solution to reservoir solution of 1:1. Larger crystals for diffraction analysis were prepared using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method in 24-well plate Linbro dishes and using crystallisation drops of 2μL, with a protein concentration of 2mgmL−1 and a ratio of protein solution to reservoir solution of 1:1. The best crystals were routinely obtained in crystal drops containing 1M sodium chloride and 1.5M ammonium sulphate in 0.1M Bis–Tris buffer at pH 6.5. Prior to analysis on in-house X-ray equipment, the crystals were soaked for 5min with a solution consisting of the mother liquor with 10mM NADH and 15% glycerol, then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals were tested for diffraction using a Rigaku Micromax-007HF fitted with Osmic multilayer optics and a MARRESEARCH MAR345 imaging plate detector. Those crystals that diffracted to greater than 3Å resolution were retained for data collection at the synchrotron. 2.3 Data collection, data processing, structure solution and refinement A complete dataset was collected on beamline I04-1 at the Diamond Light Source Synchrotron in Oxford U.K. Data were processed on the beamline using the programme XDS [24] and scaled using SCALA [25], each within the expert data processing system xia2 [26] The data collection statistics are given in Table 1 . The crystals had the space group P3121. The structure was solved using molecular replacement with the programme BALBES [27], which selected a monomer of the structure of an alcohol dehydrogenase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PDB code 2D8A) as the model. The solution contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model was improved using iterative rounds of building in COOT [28] and refinement using REFMAC [29]. In refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied for chains B, C and D against chain A. After building the protein and water molecules, clear electron density was observed to persist throughout refinement in the active site of three of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit, as observed in the F o –F c map at a level of 3σ. This density was successfully modelled and refined as NADH in the three subunits. The final NADH-complex structure displayed R cryst and R free values of 19.6% and 24.6% respectively and was finally validated using PROCHECK [30]. Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot showed 95.7% of residues in the most favoured regions, 4.0% in additional allowed and 0.3% in generously allowed regions, the latter corresponding only to the four Asp152 residues that coordinate the catalytic zinc atom in each monomer. The structure of TADH in complex with NADH has been deposited in the Protein Databank with the accession code 4cpd. 2.4 Modelling Automated docking was performed using AUTODOCK VINA 1.1.2 [31]. Coordinates for the phenylacetone substrate were prepared using the ligand builder in COOT [28] with the relevant topology files generated in PRODRG [32]. The appropriate pdbqt files for the dimeric model of TADH and the ligand, phenylacetone, were prepared in AUTODOCK Tools. The active site of TADH was contained in a grid size of 28Å×34Å×26Å (corresponding to x, y, z) with 0.375Å spacing, centred around the catalytic centre at positions 23.44Å×12.69Å×106.06Å (corresponding to x, y, z), which was generated using AutoGrid in the AUTODOCK Tools interface. The dockings were performed by VINA, therefore the posed dockings were below 2Å r.m.s.d. The results generated by VINA were visualised in AUTODOCK Tools 1.5.6 where the ligand conformations were assessed based upon lowest VINA energy, but also the following criteria: The experimentally determined (S)-enantioselectivity of TADH towards phenylacetone [21] dictated that only poses in which the (re)-face of the carbonyl was presented to the C4 carbon of the NADH nicotinamide ring (which would result in (S)-alcohol products), and in which the carbonyl group was observed to make the appropriate interaction with the side-chain hydroxyl of the catalytic proton-donor Ser40, were considered. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Overall structure of TADH Crystals of TADH grew in the P3121 space group, with four molecules, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ representing one homotetramer, in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2 ). Electron density for the protein backbone was complete in all monomers from residues Met1 to Arg346, except in subunit ‘D’, where the loop Glu7 to Val12 could not be modelled satisfactorily. The tetramer itself was made up of two dimers of closely associated monomers ‘A–B’ and ‘C–D’, each sharing an interfacial area of approximately 1600Å2. The dimer structure of TADH was characterised by 14 salt bridges between subunits ‘A’ and ‘B’ and 32 hydrogen bonds as determined by analysis using PISA [33]. The structure was analysed by the DALI server [34] and showed TADH to be most similar to the formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida (1kol [35], 31% sequence identity; rmsd 1.7Å over 344Ca atoms), the human sorbitol dehydrogenase (1pl8 [36]; 26%; rmsd 1.7Å over 344 Ca atoms) and the TbADH (1ykf; 2nvb [18,37]; 27%; rmsd 2Å over 340 Ca atoms). The similarity with 1kol is interesting as that enzyme is capable of performing a dismutation of aldehyde substrates in a manner similar to TADH, and without the addition of exogenous NADH cofactor, owing to the especially tight binding of NADH within the active site [35]. A comparison of the cofactor binding loops in these mesophilic and thermophilic aldehyde dismutases is presented later. A monomer of TADH consists of a catalytic, metal-binding domain and a nucleotide-binding, Rossman fold domain. The secondary structure is represented in Fig. 3 and the tertiary structure of the monomer in ribbon format is shown in Fig. 4 . The catalytic domain consists of a core β-sheet formed by strands β1 (residues 2–6), β2 (12–16), β3 (27–36), β4 (55–56), β5 (61–68), β6 (80–82), β7 (125–129), β8 (126–127), β16 (319–322) and β17 (341–344) surrounded by α-helices: α1 (42–45), α2 (93–97), α3 (131–134), α4 (144–147) and α12 (326–335). The catalytic domain is connected to the nucleotide binding domain by helix α11 (residues 296–308). The nucleotide binding domain is a classical Rossman fold with a central β-sheet formed by six strands β9 (residues 172–175), β10 (196–200), β11 (215–218), β12 (239–242), β13 (262–266), β15 (286–290) and β14 (273–277) surrounded by helices α5 (153–164), α6 (179–191), α7 (203–212), α8 (224–231), α9 (247–256) and α10 (279–284). 3.2 Metal binding As with other MDRs, TADH contains two zinc binding sites, which can be seen as grey spheres in Fig. 4. A structural zinc atom is coordinated by four cysteine residues: Cys89, 92, 95 and 103. A fifth cysteine in the TADH sequence, Cys38, forms part of the coordination sphere of the catalytic zinc, which is also coordinated by His59, Asp152 and a water molecule to complete the tetrahedral environment. Although an alternative carboxylate ligand near the zinc atom, in TADH represented by Glu60, has been implicated in zinc coordination in other MDRs as part of a mobile coordination environment that responds to substrate binding [12,38], no contact between this residue and the catalytic zinc was observed in any of the four subunits; indeed Glu60 was observed in each case to form a salt-bridge with Lys340. An equivalent interaction is also observed between Glu60 and Lys346 in TbADH (1ykf [37]). 3.3 The active site and cofactor binding in TADH Three out of four (A, C and D) of the subunits of TADH revealed density corresponding to the cofactor NADH (Fig. 5a), which is bound in a crevice at the domain interface that allows substrate access. The nicotinamide ring lies at the bottom of the crevice which opens out onto the enzyme surface. A superimposition of subunits ‘A’, which contains NADH, and ‘B’, which does not, reveals a small closure of the catalytic and nucleotide binding domains relative to each other on cofactor binding. The amide carbonyl of the nicotinamide ring is secured by an interaction with the backbone NH of Ala293; the C4 nicotinamide carbon, responsible for the acceptance and donation of hydride, is approximately 4.5Å from the side-chain oxygen of Ser40, the likely proton donor in reductive catalysis. TADH binds the nicotinamide ring of NADH in such a way as to present its pro-(R) hydride to the active site, in common with CPCR2 from Candida parapsilosis [12] and HLADH [6]. Apart from the catalytic serine, the remainder of the active site is largely hydrophobic (Fig. 5a), featuring residues Val108, Phe85, Leu292, Val268 and, closer to the surface, Phe115, Ile49, and Leu 282 and Val283 of the adjacent subunit in the dimer, although the phenolic side chain of Tyr111 also protrudes into the cavity. The active site of TADH hence appears to be well-suited to the binding of hydrophobic substrates. A model of the substrate phenylacetone 5 (Fig. 1) docked into the active site reveals that the phenyl ring is indeed accommodated in the immediate cavity formed by Val108, Phe85, Leu292 and Val268, when the carbonyl of the substrate is positioned as the fourth ligand to zinc, and the pro-(R) face of the carbonyl is presented to the C-4 hydride of the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 5b), as would be expected, given the experimentally observed (S)-selectivity of TADH towards this substrate. The C2 and C3 ribose hydroxyls are secured by interactions with His43, the backbone NH of Val260 and the backbone carbonyl of Val244. The C3 hydroxyl of the adenosine ribose interacts with the side chain of Arg205 and both the C3 and C2 hydroxyls of this ribose are H-bonded to the side chain carboxylate group of Asp200. A further arginine, Arg201, stacks against the adenine base of NADH. 3.4 Comparison of TADH with a mesophilic MDR homolog As has been noted for other thermophilic enzymes [14,39], TADH is characterised by a more condensed structure than mesophilic ADHs, with shorter surface loops. 1kol, for example, the formaldehyde dehydrogenase from mesophilic P. putida [35], has longer loop sections in the metal binding domain in regions 112–121 (104–107 in TADH); 24–32 (22–24 in TADH) and in the nucleotide binding domain 302–317 (269–272 in TADH); and a large loop between 263 and 281, which in TADH between strand β12 and helix α9 is only three amino acids long (245–248) (Fig. 6 ). The absence of this loop in TADH is interesting from the perspective of the aldehyde dismutase reaction. In the published description of 1kol [35], the longer loop was thought to relate specifically to the ability of this enzyme to catalyse the dismutation reaction, as, coupled with more extensive hydrogen bonding to the adenine moiety from loop side-chains, tighter binding and shielding of the cofactor from bulk solvent was ensured. This was thought to allow oxidation and reduction of the aldehyde substrate(s) to occur without release of cofactor. Given the absence of this loop in TADH, it appears that its capacity to catalyse the dismutation reaction is governed by different factors than those operating in 1kol. In addition to condensed loop regions in TADH, the thermophilic ADH also display more bonding interactions between monomers in the representative A–B dimer than in the mesophilic 1kol. The A–B dimer in 1kol features only 4 salt bridges compared with 14 in TADH, which involve residues Arg97, Arg289, Glu235 and Asp285. None of the structurally homologous residues in 1kol (Glu105, His234, Pro253 and Ser330 respectively) is either able or found to participate in salt bridges. 1kol also features only 7 H-bonds at the A–B dimer interface, compared with 32 in TADH. A larger number of dimer subunit interactions may also help to explain the greater solvent stability of TADH. A previous analysis of the structure of the solvent-tolerant ADH-A from Rhodococcus ruber [9] also pointed to the significance of greater subunit interaction as a possible basis for superior solvent stability. 3.5 Comparison of TADH with NADPH-dependent TbADH Shorter peripheral loops are also observed in the thermophilic homolog TbADH, but TADH has an even more condensed structure. TbADH features longer peripheral loops in regions 340–345 (336–339 in TADH) and 324–328 (321–324). TbADH also only features 8 salt bridges as part of its major dimer interfaces. Pro275 which is at the centre of the dimer interface, and has been shown by mutational studies to confer thermostability to TbADH [39] is conserved in TADH. The number of prolines, also thought to be factor in greater thermostability [18], when comparing mesophilic and thermostable ADHs, is even greater in TADH (25) than TbADH (21). The cofactor binding loop in TADH and TbADH is also different, as would be expected for an NADPH-dependent enzyme over an NADH-dependent one. The 2′ ribose phosphate of NADPH in TbADH is secured by bonding interactions with side-chains of Arg200, Tyr218 and Ser199. Exclusion of the 2′-ribose phosphate in TADH appears to be through the presence of a negatively charged aspartate residue, Asp200, which binds both NADH adenosine ribose hydroxyls, each through a carboxylate oxygen atom, and hydrophobic Ile202, which replaces Ser199 of TbADH. Another interesting difference in the two structures relates to the orientation of the nicotinamide ring in the substrate binding pocket in published structures of TbADH compared to TADH. In the former, the nicotinamide ring is rotated into the active site well some 60° down towards the side-chain of Trp110, significantly changing the characteristics of the active site, and partially exposing the pro-(S) hydride of the C4 carbon of the nicotinamide ring to the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 7 ). Further differences in this pocket include substitutions of Tyr267 for Val268 (TADH); Ala85 for Phe285 (TADH) and Trp110 for Val108 (TADH). These subtle but significant changes may help to explain the observation that small substrates are converted by TbADH with inverted selectivity compared to larger substrates [16,17], whereas TADH converts all substrates with (S)-selective Prelog specificity [21]. 4 Conclusion The wider use of ADHs in preparative biocatalysis will be assisted by the identification and characterisation of enzymes that display useful selectivity and attractive process characteristics such as thermal stability, tolerance of organic solvents and compatibility with abiotic reagents. The structure of TADH described herein now provides a basis for the rational engineering of this useful enzyme for improved characteristics, and also for investigations of its compatibility with ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+) and related inorganic catalysts for cofactor regeneration.

        "dc:description": "Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) of the medium chain reductase (MDR) subfamily are valuable biocatalysts for the production of optically active alcohols and are now used routinely in industry for the preparation of synthetic intermediates. TADH from Thermus sp. ATN1 combines the advantages of both thermostability and dependence on the less expensive, non-phosphoryated, cofactor NADH as the hydride donor. The structure of TADH in complex with NADH has been determined and refined to a resolution of 2.74Å. The structure reveals structural features commensurate with known stabilising factors of thermostable MDRs, including shorter peripheral loops and an increased amount of inter- and intra-subunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds compared to mesophilic MDRs of known structure. A study of the active site reveals the molecular determinants of NADH and substrate binding in TADH that help to shed light on observed differences in cofactor specificity and stereoselectivity when compared to its thermophilic NADPH-dependent homolog from Thermoanaerobium brockii (TbADH). The structure also provides a basis for investigating the enzyme-associated deactivation of the catalyst ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+), which has been used in TADH-catalysed reactions for the recycling of the nicotinamide cofactor.",
