The pyrolysis under inert atmosphere has been widely used for the synthesis of metal containing heteroatoms doped carbon materials, versatile catalysts for various reactions. However, it is difficult to prevent metal nanoparticles aggregation during pyrolysis process. Herein, we reported the efficient synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres with cobalt nanoparticles (Co NP, ca. 10 nm in size) distributed uniformly in the shell via pyrolysis of yolk-shell structured Zn-Co-ZIFs@polydopamine (PDA). PDA acted as both protection layer and carbon source, which successfully prevented the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles during high-temperature pyrolysis process. The Co NP and N containing carbon (Co NP/NC) hollow nanospheres were active for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), affording overpotential of 430 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER in 1 M KOH and comparable half-wave potential to that of Pt/C (0.80 V vs RHE) for ORR in 0.1 M KOH. The superior performance of carbon hollow nanospheres for both OER and ORR was mainly attributed to its small metal nanoparticles, N-doping and hollow nanostructure. The protection and confinement effect that originated from PDA coating strategy could be extended to the synthesis of other hollow structured carbon materials, especially the ones with small metal nanoparticles. Graphical abstract Co NP/NC bifunctional electrocatalysts with unique hollow morphology and uniformly distributed cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized from yolk-shell structured ZIFs@polydopamine, in which PDA shell acted both as protection layer and carbon source during high-temperature pyrolysis process.

In particular, hollow carbon materials have attracted special attention for energy storage and conversion applications because of their high accessible specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, and excellent chemical and mechanical stability [4–6]. The doping of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, phosphor could greatly enhance the catalytic activity of carbon materials because the heteroatoms with different electron configurations would attract or repel electrons in neighbor carbon atoms, which can act as active sites for several kinds of reactions [7–9]. Among them, nitrogen doping has been proved to be powerful to improve the performance of oxygen reduction reactions and lithium ion anchoring ability [10], and the rational design and construction of nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials-based electrocatalysts have attracted extensive research interest and aroused favorable results [11–14]. ZIF-8 materials which are rich in carbon, nitrogen and volatile zinc metal centers, are suitable precursors for the preparation of highly porous N-doped carbons (NCs) [15]. However, the lack of active metal centers limited applications of these NCs. The metal-incorporated nitrogen-doped carbons (MNCs) have attracted increasing interest because of their low cost and high catalytic activity in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [16]. Recently, active metal ions, such as Co2+, have been introduced into ZIF-8 with partial substitution of Zn2+ to form Zn-Co-ZIFs precursors, and subsequently Zn-Co-incorporated NCs through pyrolysis. The derived Zn-Co-NCs have been successfully applied in the field of electrochemistry [17–20]. However, the electrocatalytic performance of MNCs still needs further improvement, partially because of non-uniform and insufficient exposure of catalytic active sites resulting from irreversible fusion and aggregation of nanoparticles during high-temperature pyrolysis process [21]. Surface coating is a widely used strategy to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles under high-temperature reaction conditions [22]. Oxides shell, such as silica, has been successfully applied to overcome the problem of nanoparticles aggregation. However, the silica protection layer needs to be removed before electrochemical application because of intrinsic electric-insulativity of silica [23]. Polydopamine (PDA) has been widely used as biomimetic coating layers and the PDA coating was reported to be an extremely versatile method which can conformally coat substrates of various compositions, sizes, shapes and structures [24]. Due to strong adhesion ability and self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) in alkaline solution [25], the PDA could be easily coated on ZIFs nanoparticles under mild conditions. Additionally, as an organic polymer, PDA shell could be transformed into carbon shell during pyrolysis, without additional post-treatment removal process. The N-doped carbon shell derived from PDA not only improves the electrical conductivity throughout the electrode but also prevents agglomeration of active materials during electrochemical reactions [26]. More importantly, the amino group in DA could coordinate with ZIFs and the competitive reactions of coordination and polymerization could result in novel yolk-shell structure during coating process. With the aim for preparing hollow structured MNCs with uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles for electrochemical applications, herein, we chose Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA yolk-shell nanoparticles as precursor for the synthesis of cobalt-based MNCs hollow nanoparticles. The yolk-shell nanoparticles were formed by depositing a layer of PDA on the surface of ZIFs core via in situ polymerization method under alkaline conditions. The subsequent pyrolysis of ZIFs@PDA results in the formation of cobalt-incorporated nitrogen-doped carbons (Co NP/NC materials), in which Co nanoparticles with size of ∼10 nm are uniformly distributed. Studies show that Co NP/NC hollow nanomaterials are active in both electrochemical OER and ORR reactions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Zn-Co-ZIFs nanoparticles with Zn/Co molar ratio of 1/1 In a typical synthesis, Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (2.825 mmol) and Co(NO3)2•6H2O (2.825 mmol) were dissolved in 120 mL methanol (AR), and methylimidazole solution (45.06 mmol dissolved in 40 mL methanol) was added to the above solution under stirring. After stirring at room temperature for 20 h, Zn-Co-ZIFs nanoparticles obtained by filtration were washed with water and dried at room temperature. 2.2 Synthesis of Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA In a typical synthesis, 50 mg of Zn-Co-ZIFs were dispersed in 5 mL of ultrapure water, and then 50 mg of dopamine hydrochloride (denoted as DA, Alfa Aesar, 99%) and 15 mg of tris(hydroxymethyl)amino methane (denoted as Tris, Aldrich, ≥ 99.9%) were added into the mixture. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, the solid product collected by centrifugal separation was washed with water and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. 2.3 Pyrolysis of Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA for the formation of Co NP/NC-n materials Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA was thermally treated in N2 atmospheres at different temperatures (600, 700, 800 °C, respectively) for 2 h with a ramp of 5 °C/min. The samples were denoted as Co NP/NC-n, where n denotes the pyrolysis temperature. A control sample, ZIFs-700, was prepared by thermal treatment of ZIFs in N2 atmospheres at 700 °C for 2 h. 2.4 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD) were collected on a Rigaku D/Max2500 PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 3°–70° with a scan speed of 5 °/min at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was undertaken on a FEI QUANTA 200F scanning electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The samples were sputtered with gold prior to imaging. The high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) was performed on Hitachi S-5500 scanning electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was undertaken using a Hitachi HT-7700 at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The samples were placed onto an ultrathin carbon film supported on a copper grid. Selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai F30 microscope with a point resolution of 0.20 nm operated at 300 kV. The nitrogen sorption experiments were performed at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Prior to the measurement, the samples were out-gassed at 120 °C for 6 h. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface areas were calculated using adsorption data in a relative pressure range of P/P 0  = 0.05–0.25. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with an Al Kα (1486.6 eV, 15 kV, 10.8 mA) as the source and using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were performed using a CHI Electrochemical Station (Model 760E) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature. Platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst layer on the glassy carbon electrode was prepared as follows. A mixture with 5 mg of catalyst, 1 mL of absolute ethanol and 50 µL of Nafion (5 wt%, Du Pont Corp.) was prepared using sonication. A 20 µL of ink was dropped onto the glassy carbon disk, which was then left to dry in air at room temperature, to yield a catalyst loading of ca. 0.5 mg/cm2. For comparison, the loading of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey) catalyst was controlled at 10 µg Pt per cm2. The potential was converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E RHE = E SCE + 0.059 pH + 0.241. In the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests, the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were recorded in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and the electrode potential was scanned between 0.207 VRHE and 1.207 VRHE with a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The electrochemical measurements of the water oxidation reaction (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) were carried on CH Instruments Model 760E electrochemical work station using 1 M KOH as an electrolyte. Catalyst powder casted on the carbon paper was used as the working electrode. Platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as a counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The preparation method of the working electrode was as following. In brief, 1 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution consisting of 100 µL ethanol, 50 µL of water and 0.75 µL of nafion solution. The mixture was then ultrasonicated for about 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. After that, the dispersion was transferred onto the carbon paper with the catalyst loading of ∼0.18 mg/cm2. Finally, the as prepared catalyst film was dried at room temperature. The potential was converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E RHE = E SCE + 0.059 pH + 0.241. The overpotential E = E RHE – 1.23. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The catalyst was cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanned for 10 cycles before measuring the polarization curves. All polarization curves were corrected with 95% iR compensation. 3 Results and discussion Zn-Co-ZIFs nanoparticles were prepared using the procedure described for ZIF-8, excepted that Zn2+ and Co2+ with molar ratio of 1/1 was coordinated with methylimidazole in methanol at room temperature [16]. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that Zn-Co-ZIFs nanomaterials with particle size of ca. 100 nm had polyhedral morphology (in Figs. 1 a and S1a). The crystal structure of as-prepared ZIFs was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, indicating the identical crystal structure with ZIF-8 (Fig. S2a) [27]. In order to obtain Co NP/NC materials with well-distributed small Co nanoparticles, Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA nanoparticles were fabricated by surface coating of ZIFs with PDA layer through Tris catalyzed polymerization method. Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA has novel yolk-shell structure as evidenced by the TEM image (Fig. 1b). The thickness of the PDA shell is of ∼20 nm. The existence of interspace between the Zn-Co-ZIFs core and PDA layer could be observed clearly. The Zn-Co-ZIFs cores were not as dense as the parent Zn-Co-ZIFs and the existence of hollow space could be clearly observed. This suggests that Zn-Co-ZIFs cores were etched during PDA coating process. Based on XRD results, Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA presented identical XRD pattern with parent Zn-Co-ZIFs, suggesting that crystalline structure of Zn-Co-ZIFs core in the yolk-shell nanoparticles remains intact after PDA layer coating (Fig. S2b). To investigate the formation mechanism of such interspace, control experiments were carried out. With only Tris addition, the morphology and crystalline structure of Zn-Co-ZIFs nanoparticles kept intact based on TEM and XRD characterizations (Fig. S1b and S2c). With only DA addition, the hollow nanospheres with size of ca. 140 nm were formed (TEM image see Fig. S1c). Furthermore, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Zn-Co-ZIFs totally disappeared in the XRD pattern (Fig. S2d), indicating that Zn-Co-ZIFs were completely etched by DA. Therefore, there are two competitive reactions during PDA coating process, the coordination of DA with Zn-Co-ZIFs to etch Zn-Co-ZIFs and polymerization of DA around Zn-Co-ZIFs for the formation of PDA. The faster polymerization rate of DA, the less amount of etched Zn-Co-ZIFs. The successful formation of yolk-shell nanostructure in Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA was possibly due to the accelerated polymerization rate of DA in the presence of Tris [28]. To date, yolk-shell structures with various compositions have been fabricated by selective etching sacrificial layers to generate the void space [29,30]. The formation of yolk-shell structure during one-pot in situ polymerization process is rarely reported [31]. Thermal treatment in N2 at 700 °C converted Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA into Co NP/NC-700. The TEM and HR-SEM images showed that Co NP/NC-700 had spherical morphology with particle size of ca. 140 nm, similar to that of Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA (Fig. 1c and d). The nanoparticles with particle size of ca. 10 nm were uniformly embedded in Co NP/NC-700. Furthermore, Co NP/NC-700 had hollow structure with shell thickness of ca. 20 nm, similar to the thickness of PDA layer in Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA. HAADF-STEM image further confirmed the nanoparticle with size of ca. 10 nm uniformly distributed in Co NP/NC-700 (Fig. 1e). Based on the HR-TEM (Fig. 1f) and XRD characterizations discussed later, the metal nanoparticles were mainly metallic cobalt accompanied with cobalt oxides. It is worthy to mention that preparation of Co NP/NC hollow nanostructure with small and uniform metal nanoparticles was rarely reported, presumably due to easy aggregation of metal nanoparticles under high-temperature pyrolysis conditions [32,33]. As a contrast, Zn-Co-ZIFs were pyrolyzed at 700 °C for 2 h in inert atmosphere, denoted as ZIFs-700. The TEM image shows that ZIFs-700 is composed of porous carbons and irregularly shaped metal particles with wide size distributions (Fig. S3). This proves that the fusion and aggregation of metal nanoparticles occur during the pyrolysis process, which is a generally confronted problem for the synthesis of MNCs by pyrolysis method. The existence of large metal nanoparticles would have negative effect on the performance of electrocatalysts based on previous report [34]. The above results demonstrated that PDA coating is an effective strategy to confine the growth and prevent aggregation of cobalt particles during pyrolysis process. Co NP/NC-600 and Co NP/NC-800 were obtained by pyrolysis of Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA at 600 °C and 800 °C, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. 2 , Co NP/NC-600 and Co NP/NC-800 both had hollow sphere nanostructure with embedded metal nanoparticles, similar to Co NP/NC-700. But metal nanoparticles of Co NP/NC-800 were not as uniform as those of Co NP/NC-700. Larger metal particles (> 20 nm) can be clearly observed in the TEM image of Co NP/NC-800, showing that high pyrolysis temperature caused Co particle aggregation (Fig. 2c). The above results suggest that hollow Co NP/NC materials were formed by pyrolysis of Zn-Co-ZIFs@PDA with yolk-shell nanostructure, irrespective of the pyrolysis temperature. During the pyrolysis process, carbonation of PDA and ZIFs occurs. The volatile fragments formed by ZIFs decomposition combined with those derived from PDA have formed the carbon shell. At the same time, Co and Zn species were reduced or oxidized by CH x , C or others to form metal or metal oxide particles. The confined nanospace may prevent the aggregation of metal species under optimized pyrolysis conditions, which resulted in the formation of small nanoparticles. The PDA layer played not only as the protection layer but also as the carbon source. This strategy is convenient and can be further extended to prepare other materials with carbon shell. The porosity of Co NP/NC materials was characterized using nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement (Figs. 3 a, S4 and Table 1 ). All Co NP/NC-n materials gave a H3 hysteresis loop at relative pressure P/P 0 of 0.45–0.98, characteristic of materials with hollow nanostructure. A sharp uptake at low relative pressure was observed in N2 sorption isotherms of Co NP/NC-600 and Co NP/NC-700, showing that both materials had micropore. Co NP/NC-800 did not have micropore as evidenced by the absence of this uptake. The BET surface area, total pore volume and micropore volume increased in the order of Co NP/NC-700 > Co NP/NC-600 > Co NP/NC-800. Co NP/NC-800 only had BET surface area of 88 m2/g, showing that high pyrolysis temperature did not benefit for the formation of porous materials. The BET surface area and total pore volume of ZIFs-700 was smaller than that of Co NP/NC-700, which further demonstrated the advantage of the PDA coating for improvement of the porosity. The chemical compositions of Co NP/NC materials were characterized by ICP measurement (Table S1). The cobalt content was 14.2%, 17.7% and 15.1% in Co NP/NC-600, Co NP/NC-700 and Co NP/NC-800, respectively, with corresponding zinc content of 7.0%, 1.8% and 0.3%. The ICP results suggested that the zinc content was reduced with pyrolysis temperature increasing while the cobalt content was almost consistent. It is worth noting that the cobalt content was pretty high in Co NP/NC-700, and the PDA coating was proved to be an effective strategy to control the metal particle size small and uniform with high metal content at the same time. The cobalt and zinc content was 27.8% and 4.5% for ZIFs-700, which was much higher than that for Co NP/NC-700. The lower metal content in Co NP/NC-n meant higher carbon content, which might be caused by reduced volatilization of organic fragments or donation by PDA layer. The crystal structure of Co NP/NC materials was characterized by XRD technique (Fig. 3b). In the XRD pattern of Co NP/NC-600, the main diffraction peaks could be ascertained to be hexagonal zincite (JCPDS card no. 36-1451), indicating the existence of ZnO. The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 44.2°, 51.3° and 75.9° could be assigned to metallic cobalt (JCPDS card no. 15-0806) and relatively week diffraction peaks at 2θ of 36.5°, 42.3° and 61.5° are from cobalt oxide (JCPDS card no. 48-1719). Therefore, Co NP/NC-600 was composed of ZnO, Co, and CoO based on the XRD result. For Co NP/NC-700, the main diffraction peaks were from metallic cobalt. The representative HR-TEM image in Fig. 1(f) also shows (111) and (002) crystal lattices of cubic phase metallic cobalt with interplane spacings of 2.06 Å and 1.79 Å, respectively. Relatively weak diffraction peaks assigned to cobalt oxide were also observed. The XRD results confirmed that Co NP/NC-700 was mainly composed of metallic cobalt accompanied with cobalt oxides. The absence of zinc oxide in Co NP/NC-700 might be caused by reduction of Zn2+ and evaporation of Zn during high-temperature pyrolysis [35]. Co NP/NC-800 also consisted of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide, and the sharp and strong diffraction peaks indicated the existence of relatively large metal particle, which is consistent with the TEM results. While for ZIFs-700, the XRD pattern indicated that only metallic cobalt existed without cobalt oxide. The difference in the XRD patterns between Co NP/NC-700 and ZIFs-700 suggested that the reduction degree of Co2+ into Co metal particles in the presence of PDA layer is not as high as that in the absence of PDA layer. XPS survey spectra of Co NP/NC materials gave feature peaks of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Co 2p, and Zn 2p (Fig. S5). For Co NP/NC-700 and ZIFs-700, the peak of Zn 2p was observed, even though the diffraction peaks of zinc-derived crystal phase were insignificant in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3b). The discrepancy might be caused by the low content and high dispersity of zinc in Co NP/NC-700 and ZIFs-700, which could be hardly detected by XRD measurement. The fine structure of N 1s was investigated because the nitrogen atoms doped in carbon play an important role in the catalysis processes [9]. As shown in Fig. 4 , the N 1s peak could be deconvoluted into the signals of pyridinic (∼398 eV), pyrrolic (∼399 eV), graphitic (∼400 eV) and oxidized (∼403 eV) nitrogen atoms [9]. The graphitic N substituted carbon atoms with the rolled-graphitic plane in the carbon matrix. The pyridinic and pyrrolic N could coordinate with the transition metal ions to produce metal-N x centers. According to the peak fitting results (Table 1), the relative content of the graphitic N in Co NP/NC-n increased with the pyrolysis temperature increasing, while that of pyridinic and pyrrolic N gave an opposite tendency. For ZIFs-700, the nitrogen atoms were mainly in the form of pyridinic N. XPS results showed that ZIFs-700 and Co NP/NC-700 had different types of N species. This was possibly due to the fact that carbon species of ZIFs-700 and Co NP/NC-700 derived respectively from ZIFs and mixture of PDA and ZIFs. The catalytic performance of Co NP/NC materials for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated in alkaline solution (1 M KOH). The OER activity was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) after cyclic voltammetric scans became stable with the consistent mass-loading of all materials on carbon paper (0.18 mg/cm2). Based on polarization curves shown in Fig. 5 (a), Co NP/NC-700 displayed superior performance for OER in the test region. The OER performance of Co NP/NC-800 was comparable with that of Co NP/NC-700 with similar onset potential and current density. Based on the XRD results in Fig. 3(b), Co NP/NC-800 was composed of cobalt and cobalt oxides, while the cobalt oxide phase is hardly detected in Co NP/NC-700. It has been reported the species of active site and the active site density affects significantly the OER performance of an electrocatalyst, and CoO nanomaterials was reported as high OER performance electrocatalyst [13]. Thus, Co NP/NC-800 with low surface area showed comparable OER activity to Co NP/NC-700. The current density for Co NP/NC-600 was the lowest in the measured region, possibly due to the poor conductivity. To compare the conductivity of different materials, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed and the results (Fig. S6) were analyzed using the Randles circuit. In the model, R ct is a charge transfer resistance. The fitting results indicated that the R ct of Co NP/NC-600 was the largest, meaning poor conductivity of Co NP/NC-600. The conductivity of Co NP/NC materials was in the order of Co NP/NC-700 > Co NP/NC-800 > Co NP/NC-600. The R ct of Co NP/NC-700 was less than that of ZIFs-700, demonstrating the advantage of the PDA coating in the conductivity improvement. The polarization curve from Co NP/NC-700 showed a much more negative onset potential and greater current density than that of ZIFs-700. The overpotential at 10 mA/cm2, commonly used to judge the activity of the OER, was 430 mV for Co NP/NC-700, while ZIFs-700 afforded such a current density at η of 490 mV. The above results indicated that Co NP/NC-700 is more active than ZIFs-700. This is possibly due to the smaller particle size of metal particles and hollow nanostructure of Co NP/NC-700. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the key steps in fuel cells for chemical to electrical energy conversion. The ORR catalytic activity of the Co NP/NC materials was measured and the results are displayed in Fig. 5(b). Compared with Co NP/NC-600 and Co NP/NC-800, Co NP/NC-700 showed a better overall performance with more positive onset potential, more positive half-wave potential, and larger limiting current density. The catalytic performance of Co NP/NC-700 was almost comparable to 20% commercial Pt/C. The onset potential and half-wave potential of Co NP/NC-600 was the most negative, possibly due to the poor conductivity. Co NP/NC-800 displayed the lowest limiting current density. The porosity of the materials might play a key role in determining high limiting current density because the diffusion controlling kinetics was related to the exposure degree of active sites [36–39]. Thus, the low limiting current density of Co NP/NC-800 was possibly related to its low BET surface area and pore volume. ZIFs-700 showed comparable ORR activity to Co NP/NC-700 though the former had large metal particle size. It has been reported that pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms could be coordinated with transition metal ions to produce metal-N x centers serving as active sites for ORR [40]. Thus, the relative high content of pyridinic N in ZIFs-700 might be responsible for its high ORR performance. The electron transfer number of Co NP/NC-700 was calculated according to the Koutecky–Levich equation (Fig. S7). The average electrons transferred during the reaction were 3.85, which demonstrated that the oxygen reduction mainly followed the four electrons transfer pathway [41]. Though hybrid materials composed of Co NP and nitrogen-doped carbon have been reported to be active for both OER and ORR [2,42,43], the hollow structured Co NP/NC materials have been rarely reported as bifunctional electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic activity of Co NP/NC-700 in this work was compared with other ZIFs-derived Co NP/NC hybrid materials for both OER and ORR activity (Table S2). Co NP/NC-700 showed comparable activity to those previously reported in the literatures [20,43–45]. The electrocatalytic results suggested that Co NP/NC-700 with hollow nanostructure and uniform distribution of small metal nanoparticles was active for both OER and ORR reactions, indicating that it could serve as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both water oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. 4 Conclusions In summary, we developed a PDA coating strategy for the synthesis of Co NP/NC hollow nanospheres with small cobalt nanoparticles (ca. 10 nm in size) distributed uniformly in the shell via pyrolysis of ZIFs@PDA yolk-shell nanoparticles. PDA layer acted as both protection layer to prevent the aggregation of metal nanoparticles and carbon source during high-temperature pyrolysis process, resulting to Co NP/NC with high cobalt content and uniform metal particle distribution. The electrochemical results demonstrated that Co NP/NC materials served as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. The superior performance of Co NP/NC-700 for both OER and ORR might benefit from its unique hollow nanostructure, small particle sizes and uniform distribution of zinc-cobalt metal nanoparticles, suitable nitrogen species and high surface area. This research would provide a new strategy to design and prepare hierarchically porous carbon-based bifunctional catalysts for next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies, such as fuel cells, rechargeable metal-air batteries, and overall water splitting.

However, it is difficult to prevent metal nanoparticles aggregation during pyrolysis process. Herein, we reported the efficient synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres with cobalt nanoparticles (Co NP, ca. 10 nm in size) distributed uniformly in the shell via pyrolysis of yolk-shell structured Zn-Co-ZIFs@polydopamine (PDA). PDA acted as both protection layer and carbon source, which successfully prevented the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles during high-temperature pyrolysis process. The Co NP and N containing carbon (Co NP/NC) hollow nanospheres were active for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), affording overpotential of 430 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER in 1 M KOH and comparable half-wave potential to that of Pt/C (0.80 V vs RHE) for ORR in 0.1 M KOH. The superior performance of carbon hollow nanospheres for both OER and ORR was mainly attributed to its small metal nanoparticles, N-doping and hollow nanostructure. The protection and confinement effect that originated from PDA coating strategy could be extended to the synthesis of other hollow structured carbon materials, especially the ones with small metal nanoparticles.",
