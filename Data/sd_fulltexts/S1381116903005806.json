Tel.: +55-51-333-30414; fax: +55-51-331-66304. Pd/NaY-zeolite and Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts were prepared from Pd(NO3)2 and photochemical activation of [W(CO)6]. The catalysts were active for NO decomposition at 573K leading mainly to N2 and N2O. When the reduction pretreatment was 973K the presence of tungsten led to higher conversion for a longer period of time. Tungsten prevents the sintering of small palladium particles and suppress N2O formation. In this work, Pd/NaY-zeolite and Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts were prepared from the compounds Pd(NO3)2 and [W(CO)6]. Palladium catalysts supported on NaY-zeolite were prepared by ion exchange and impregnation methods. Subsequently, tungsten was added by photochemical activation of [W(CO)6] in order to obtain a Pd-W interaction. The catalysis materials were characterized by diffuse reflectance (DRIFTS)–FTIR, chemical analysis (AAS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 chemisorption and sorption measurements. The prepared catalysts were found to be active for NO decomposition at 573K leading mainly to N2 and N2O. The conversion of NO and the selectivity to N2O were studied as a function of time and the reduction temperature. The Pd/NaY-zeolite and the Pd-W/NaY-zeolite samples exhibited an initial period of high and constant activity followed by deactivation. For samples reduced at 573K the deactivation process becomes more pronounced in the presence of tungsten. On the other hand when the reduction pretreatment was carried out at 973K the presence of tungsten allowed the catalysts to have a higher conversion for a longer period of time. Tungsten prevents the sintering of small palladium particles. Another beneficial effect of tungsten was a significant suppression of N2O formation. The selectivity for N2O at similar NO conversion level was lower on Pd-W/NaY-zeolite. Keywords NO decomposition NaY-zeolite Palladium Tungstencarbonyl Catalysts 1 Introduction In an attempt to increase the catalytic activity of palladium catalysts for the removal of hydrocarbons and NO x several promoters such as WO3, Co3O4, La2O3 and MO3 have been used [1–9]. The interaction between the noble metal and the oxide seems to be an essential condition for changing the catalytic behavior. However, using inorganic precursors a high metal oxide loading is in fact needed to satisfy this condition. One way of preventing this problem is the use of organometallic compounds; in this way preparations with low loadings and more controlled interactions could be obtained. Recently, we have demonstrated that an alternative procedure for depositing tungsten or molybdenum on Al2O3 or Pd/Al2O3 is based on the photochemical reaction of [M(CO)6] compounds (M=W, Mo) [10–14]. In this way we have prepared and characterized catalysts where tungsten or molybdenum were found in close association with palladium. Moreover, these catalysts showed high activity for NO decomposition [12,15]. The purpose of this work was to extend our previous studies performed on γ-Al2O3 to zeolites, as it is known that metalcarbonyls interact more strongly with zeolites that with alumina [16–19]. Another motivation for this work are the reports that show that very active and selective catalysts for the reduction of nitric oxide with methane are obtained by supporting palladium on zeolites [20,21], the role of the support being the stabilization of Pd2+ species. Hence, Pd/NaY-zeolite catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation and ionic exchange methods and the related Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts were obtained by photochemical activation of [W(CO)6]. A high amount of Pd was incorporated on the support by the ionic exchange method, in the hope of increasing the interaction with tungsten, since it is known that metalcarbonyls react preferentially with large palladium particles [13]. The monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were characterized by hydrogen sorption, chemisorption and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements. In addition, the effect of tungsten on the activity and selectivity of Pd/NaY-zeolite for NO decomposition at 573K was investigated for samples reduced at 573 and 973K. 2 Experimental The catalysts were prepared using a commercial NaY-zeolite as a support. The NaY-zeolite was obtained from ITQ, Valencia, Spain (surface area 655m2/g; SiO2/Al2O3=5.2 and Na2O/Al2O3=1.02 molar ratio). The NaY-zeolite has a structure that shows two channel systems interconnected. One system was formed by the union of α supercages (i.d.=12.4Å) that can be reached by channels 12 membered rings (12 MR) with a diameter of 7.8Å. Another channel system is formed by the alternated connection of sodalite cages (i.d. of 6.6Å) and the α supercage, that can be reached by channels 6 MR (diameter of 2.2Å). The NaY-zeolite support was first treated in synthetic air for 3h at 723K and under vacuum for 1h at 723K. The material was cooled at room temperature in vacuum and then stored under argon. 2.1 Pd incorporation In the pretreated support, palladium was incorporated by two different methods: ionic exchange (IE) and dry impregnation (DI), following the procedure described by Cañizares et al. [22]. In the ionic exchange method, a Pd(NO3)2 solution (20ml of 0.05mol/l for 1g of support) was added in a pretreated support at 298K and under agitation for 2h. Then, the suspension was filtered and washed with deionizated water. In the dry impregnation method, a specific quantity of Pd(NO3)2 solution was added in a pretreated support. The quantity used, equal to the pore volume of the support material was calculated to place approximately 1% of palladium by weight on the support. The solvent was removed by evaporation. The samples prepared by both methods were dried at 393K for 14h, and treated at 673K in synthetic air for 3h and then reduced with H2 at 573 or 973K for 1h. 2.2 W incorporation The W incorporation was carried out through a photochemical activation of the organometallic compound [W(CO)6] (Aldrich) and hexane as solvent in the presence of the Pd/NaY-zeolite catalyst. The quantities used were calculated to give 2% by weight of W on the zeolite (1g of Pd-zeolite; 0.038g of [W(CO)6]; 40cm3 of hexane). The photochemical reactions were performed at room temperature under an Ar atmosphere using a Philips HPL-N (125W) UV lamp fitted into a Pyrex cold finger. In order to observe the reaction progress, small liquid samples were withdrawn for analysis by FTIR. After an irradiation time of 6h, the solid was filtered and washed with hexane. Small amounts of solution were removed for solution FTIR analysis. Finally, the generated subcarbonyl species were decomposed by thermal treatment at 573K under vacuum. 2.3 Characterization The prepared materials were characterized by DRIFTS–FTIR, chemical analysis (AAS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 chemisorption and sorption experiments. Diffuse reflectance (DRIFTS) spectra were recorded at ca. 293K on a Bomem MB-102 Spectrometer, coadding 32 scans at a resolution of 4cm−1. The study was restricted to the ν(CO) region (2200–1700cm−1). The solid phases were analyzed as powder in a DRIFTS accessory, equipped with sampling cups. The latter were filled with the support powder and transferred to the equipment as fast as possible, to prevent decomposition. These spectra were collected as reflectance units and transformed to Kubelka–Munk (KM) units. The solutions were analyzed with a pair of matched NaCl solution cells (0.10mm pathlengths). The TPR experiments were carried out in a conventional apparatus using an H2/Ar mixture (5% H2). Catalysts samples of 20 or 100mg, depending on the metal content, were packed in a glass tube and pretreated in a flow of 4.9% O2/Ar at 773K for 1h. After oxygen treatment, the samples were purged under a flow of argon and then cooled to 223K. The TPR profiles were obtained in the 223–773K temperature range with a heating rate of 10K/min at a constant flow rate of 20cm3/min. Hydrogen chemisorption and sorption isotherms were measured in a volumetric glass adsorption apparatus equipped with a MKS Baratron type PDR-A pressure gauge. An ultimate vacuum near 9.3×10−4 Pa could be obtained, as measured by a Granville-Philips Model 274002 ionization gauge. The amount of hydrogen absorbed and chemisorbed on the exposed palladium atoms was measured after sample reduction in flowing H2 at 573K followed by overnight evacuation at the same temperature and cooling to room temperature. Subsequently, the amount of absorbed hydrogen forming α or β palladium-hydride was measured after room temperature evacuation for 30min. In this way, only the amount of absorbed hydrogen is removed while that corresponding to strongly chemisorbed hydrogen, (H/Pd)s, remains on the surface [23]. Unfortunately, reliable measurements of this amount of hydrogen, which provides information on the fraction of exposed palladium atoms, was only possible for the Pd-W/NaY (DI) sample due to the unavailability of the appropriate amount of the Pd/NaY (DI) catalyst and the very small metal dispersion (large particles) on the catalysts prepared by ionic exchange. Consequently, on samples with high metal loading the palladium particle size was measured by X-ray diffraction line broadening. Experiments were performed on a Siemens D 5000 instrument operated at 30kV and 30mA with radiation from a Cu target. The particle size was calculated by the Scherrer equation with the peak width corresponding to the Pd (111) reflection. 2.4 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity for NO decomposition of the prepared catalysts was measured in a glass flow reactor (i.d.=13mm) coupled to a FTIR MB100-BOMEM spectrometer equipped with a multiple-reflexion gas cell (7.0m path length and 2.1l volume). The reaction was studied as a function of time at 573K, using a feed mixture of NO (500ppm) in Ar. The glass reactor was filled with 120mg of catalyst and the flow rate was adjusted at 60cm3/min. The NO, NO2 and N2O stretching bands were monitored. The bands intervals were 1955–1790cm−1, 1658–1565cm−1 and 2266–2159cm−1, respectively. In order to calculate the NO conversion from the IR data a method developed in our laboratory by Dallago et al. [24] was used. It enables us to determine with precision the NO concentration at the entrance of the gas cell (reactor exit) from the absorbance values measured. 3 Results and discussion The main properties of the mono and bimetallic catalysts are presented in Table 1 . The very large palladium uptake shown by the sample prepared by IE, 8.9%, is in accord with the use of a concentrated solution of Pd(NO3)2. Taking into account that the NaY-zeolite has a Si/Al ratio of around 2.4, the amount of palladium corresponds to an exchange capacity of about 38%. Due to the high metal loading the palladium particle size measured by XRD on the monometallic and the bimetallic sample was quite large; 32–33nm. On the other hand, using the DI method a palladium sample with a much lower metal uptake was obtained; 1.26%. We were able to perform a hydrogen chemisorption measurement on the bimetallic sample and the (H/Pd)s ratio that is equal to the fraction of exposed palladium atoms was found to be 0.25. Using this value the palladium particle size was estimated from the equation: d (nm)=1.12/(H/Pd)s=4.5 as shown in Table 1 [25]. Taking into account that the chemisorption measurement was carried out on the bimetallic sample, the palladium particle size may be smaller if W atoms are deposited on the metal surface precluding the adsorption of hydrogen. 3.1 Pd/ NaY-zeolite catalysts The TPR profiles of the two Pd/NaY-zeolite catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . It is important to notice that the mass of catalyst used in each experiment was varied in order to compensate for the large difference in metal content. The low temperature peaks in these profiles are clearly due to the reduction of palladium oxide crystals and β-hydride formation. The subsequent negative peaks are due to hydrogen desorption (β-hydride decomposition). The sample prepared by ion exchange shows a much higher hydrogen uptake, the reduction temperature is the lowest, 269K and the peak due to hydrogen desorption at 347K is very sharp. This behavior, which is typical of preparations with a low metal dispersion (large particles), is due to the high palladium concentration. Homeyer and Sachtler [26] have reported similar TPR profiles for 2% Pd/NaY sample prepared by IE following oxidation at 773K. The presence of large palladium particles on the Pd/NaY (IE) sample, demonstrated by the XRD measurements, was confirmed by the H2 sorption data. As shown in Fig. 2 the α-hydride phase to β-hydride phase transition is quite sharp. On the other hand, the catalyst prepared by DI shows a TPR profile with a higher reduction temperature, 295K, the peak is broader and the hydrogen desorption peak is located at a higher temperature; 351K. Due to the lower metal loading, there is a stronger interaction with the zeolite leading to small particles. In other words, the palladium dispersion is much higher. In accordance with this situation the hydrogen sorption results in Fig. 2 demonstrate the absence of the α–β-hydride transition. It is important to realize that the hydrogen uptakes in Fig. 2 correspond to the amount absorbed, (H/Pd)abs, not to hydrogen adsorbed. Extrapolation to zero pressure gives the amount of hydrogen due to the α-hydride phase which is equal for both samples, as expected. On the other hand, extrapolation of the high pressure region for sample Pd/NaY(IE) gives a value of (H/Pd)abs=0.65 which is close to the palladium-hydride stoichiometry for the β-hydride phase [27]. 3.2 Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts The amount of tungsten incorporated on the Pd/NaY-zeolite samples was followed by the decrease of the ν(CO) IR band of [W(CO)6] (1983cm−1) in the hexane solution, as it has been explained elsewhere [10–14]. As shown in Table 1 the tungsten loading does not depend on the amount of palladium; it was slightly higher in the ion exchange preparation. After the photochemical reaction, the DRIFTS spectra of the solid did not show any ν(CO) band, in opposition to the situation where a ligand (PPh3) was used to stabilize the tungstencarbonyl derivatives [10,11]. The beneficial effect of this ligand in stabilizing surface species on NaY-zeolite is shown in Fig. 3a . This spectrum is more complex than the one obtained when the same reaction was performed on alumina [12]. The bands might be attributed to either a stronger interaction of M–CO with the Lewis acid sites of the support and a consequent lowering of the symmetry or to different sites for coordination [14]. Examining this spectrum, it can be seen that the bands at 2073 and 1943cm−1 can be attributed to the a1rad and a1ax+e modes, respectively, of the pentacarbonyl derivative [W(CO)5PPh3]. The band at 2073cm−1 does not change in comparison with that of alumina, but the one around 1943cm−1 is splitted in three, showing that these modes are more sensible to the different interactions with the zeolite acid sites. The bands at 2021, 1916, 1888 and 1867cm−1 are related to b2, b1, a1, e, a1 modes, respectively, of the cis-disubstituted compound, cis-[W(CO)4(PPh3)2]. The weak bands at 1992, 1976 and 1966cm−1 can be related to the t1u mode of [W(CO)6] interacting in different sites. The band at 1896cm−1 (e1u mode) indicates the presence of the trans-disubstituted species. In Fig. 3b and c are the spectra obtained in this work for the NaY-zeolite support and the Pd/NaY-zeolite (IE) catalyst without the ligand PPh3. As it can be seen, only traces of [W(CO)6−n ] species are observed, because the subcarbonyl species decomposed rapidly upon exposure of the solid sample to air. However, a specific interaction between hexacarbonyl species and the metal surface takes place during the photochemical reaction. Xu and Zaera [28] have shown that a complete and rapid decarbonylation of [W(CO)6] takes place when this compound is adsorbed on a nickel film. In a previous study we have found evidence that partially decarbonylated species adsorb and decompose rapidly on the surface of reduced palladium [13]. The effect of tungsten addition on the oxidation-reduction behavior of the Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts is shown in Fig. 4 . The TPR profile for the Pd-W/NaY (DI)-zeolite sample presents sharp and narrow peaks for hydrogen consumption and hydrogen desorption. The hydrogen consumption peak is positioned at the same temperature shown by the monometallic sample, 296K, and the calculated peak area demonstrates that despite the change in peak shape the same amount of palladium is involved in the oxidation-reduction process. On the other hand, the hydrogen desorption peak appears at a lower temperature; 330K. This behavior reflects an interaction between palladium and tungsten that facilitates the decomposition of the β-hydride. The profile for the Pd-W/NaY(IE)-zeolite catalysts reveals a large reduction in hydrogen consumption (about 50%) relative to that of the monometallic catalyst. In addition, the TPR profile exhibits two hydrogen desorption peaks, located at 329 and 342K. One possible explanation is that the initial sample treatment at 773K in 5% O2 might be not sufficient to oxidize all Pd atoms due to its interaction with tungsten. The two β-hydride decomposition peaks found for the ionic exchange sample suggests the presence of different palladium particles; large ones with a close interaction with tungsten characterized by a desorption peak at 329K and small ones located in the α-supercage or the sodalite cage with a desorption at 342K. Consequently, the TPR measurements demonstrate that both preparation methods lead to a palladium-tungsten interaction. There would appear to be an advantage of using zeolites over alumina, because in our previous studies we have found that tungsten hexacarbonyls have a tendency to interact mainly with large palladium particles supported on alumina [13]. 3.3 Catalytic activity and selectivity for NO decomposition 3.3.1 Pd/NaY (DI)-zeolite and Pd-W/NaY (DI)-zeolite catalysts Fig. 5 shows the activity for NO decomposition at 573K on samples reduced at the same temperature. Both the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts exhibited a period of very high activity followed by a steady deactivation due to oxygen retention by Pd° atoms and perhaps WO3−x species formed during the reduction pretreatment. It is generally accepted that the catalytic decomposition of NO occurs on reduced metals. However the oxygen produced by the NO dissociation remains strongly adsorbed and depending on the reaction temperature may even lead to oxidation of the metal. It is shown in Fig. 5 that the bimetallic sample deactivates faster, indicating that, under the chosen conditions, the palladium-tungsten interaction decreased the fraction of exposed palladium atoms. According to these results the addition of tungsten to a Pd/NaY-zeolite catalyst prepared by dry impregnation and containing a moderate palladium loading does not improve its activity for the NO decomposition reaction. As observed in Fig. 6 similar samples reduced at 973K behave quite differently. In this case, the monometallic catalyst deactivates very rapidly because large palladium particles, with a smaller fraction of exposed metal atoms, are formed by the sintering process that takes place in H2 at 973K. In other words, the initial (H/Pd)s ratio (≥0.25) decreases and the 4.5nm particles growth to some extent. Bulk oxidation of large particles is a slow process that limits the rate of NO decomposition. On the other hand, the presence of tungsten on Pd-W/NaY (DI)-zeolite leads to a brief period of high activity followed by a slow and steady deactivation. The improved behavior of this sample is in part due to the presence of reduced tungsten species and also to inhibition of the palladium sintering process in hydrogen. In addition to changes in catalytic activity there is a promotional effect of tungsten on the reaction selectivity to N2. It is important to mention first that N2O and N2 were the only reaction products; the formation of NO2 was negligible. Another characteristic of the NO decomposition reaction on metals observed here was that the onset of N2O formation is in accord with the initiation of the deactivation process [12]. As shown in Table 2 the presence of tungsten decreases the selectivity to N2O (for a NO conversion of 60%) to a large extent, from 81 to 27% for the Pd/NaY (DI)-zeolite sample reduced at 573K. It is observed that the reaction time to reach a conversion level of 60% for the bimetallic sample is reduced, in accordance with the loss of activity already discussed. The inhibited formation of N2O on Pd-W/NaY (DI)-zeolite may be attributed to the resistance of palladium to oxidation or to oxygen retention in the presence of reduced tungsten species, as found on a previous study carried out on Pd-W/γ-Al2O3 [29]. It was demonstrated by Rottlander et al. [30] that surface oxygen limits the dissociation of adsorbed NO and consequently the NOad+Nad reaction is favored. Another interpretation for the change in selectivity may be the promotion of oxygen desorption. It was shown by Chuang and Tan [31] that the addition of terbium oxide to a Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst facilitates the desorption of oxygen during NO decomposition. Unfortunately, we were not able to follow the evolution of oxygen due to the use of FTIR analysis to follow the reaction progress. Turning our attention to the behavior of the Pd/NaY (DI)-zeolite sample reduced at 973K, Table 2 exhibits a sharp decline in activity, 60% conversion in 25min, but also a very low selectivity to N2O. This is a surprising result because it is expected that large palladium particles favor the formation of N2O [32]. In our opinion the reason for this behavior is the slow response of the FTIR cell to sudden changes in N2O concentration. Consequently, the effect of the high reduction temperature on the reaction selectivity of the Pd/NaY (DI)-zeolite sample is apparent. 3.3.2 Pd/NaY(IE)-zeolite and Pd-W/NaY(IE)-zeolite catalysts The monometallic sample exhibited a high and stable activity for a period of 7h when reduced at 573, as shown in Fig. 7 . When tungsten was incorporated there was a period of 100% conversion of approximately 100min followed by a marked deactivation. Therefore, here again it seems that the presence of tungsten in close association with palladium particles inhibited the NO reaction. However, when the reduction temperature was 973K, a more comparable performance between the mono and the bimetallic catalyst was obtained. As observed in Fig. 8 the Pd-W/NaY(IE)-zeolite catalysts exhibited a conversion of 100% for about 3h, followed by a slow deactivation. This behavior is attributed to the presence of reduced tungsten species. No change in palladium particle size should be expected, because of the very large particles on the fresh catalyst obtained by the IE preparation method. Turning the attention to the reaction selectivity, the beneficial effect of tungsten addition on catalysts prepared by IE was important for samples reduced at 573 and 773K. The results in Table 2 indicate a clear reduction on the undesirable formation of N2O; the selectivity to this compound decreased from 87 to 60% and from 75 to 52% depending on the reduction temperature. Here again several interpretations could be offered to explain these results; the presence of reduced tunsgten species may act as oxygen scavenger or may facilitate the desorption of oxygen. More specific studies are needed to discriminate between these possibilities. 4 Conclusions It has been demonstrated that the photochemical reaction of tungsten hexacarbonyl with Pd/NaY-zeolite catalysts of high (large particles) and low (small particles) metal content enables the preparation of bimetallic samples. The method of preparation leads to a palladium-tungsten interaction that modifies the catalytic activity and the selectivity of the Pd/NaY-zeolite catalysts for the NO decomposition reaction. For samples reduced at high temperature, the presence of tungsten prevents the sintering of small palladium particles. However, the main effect of tungsten is a reduction on the selectivity to N2O. In other words, tungsten suppresses the undesirable formation of N2O.
