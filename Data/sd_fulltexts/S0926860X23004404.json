Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310027 China. Propylene polymerizations catalyzed by MgCl2/Di/TiCl4-AlEt3/siloxane in the absence and presence of hydrogen were studied by determining the time-dependent changes of catalytic activity, number of active centers and active center distribution. Three types of active centers with high, medium and very low stereoselectivity were differentiated by fractionating the polymer into three parts. Chain propagation rate constant of each type of active centers was estimated by linear fitting/extrapolating the time-dependent change of apparent propagation rate constant. The centers with high (Ci*), medium (Cm*) and low (Ca*) stereoselectivity responded to addition of hydrogen differently. Adding hydrogen caused marked increase of Ci*, but its propagation rate constant (k pi) was evidently reduced. In contrast, numbers of Cm* and Ca* were only slightly affected, but their propagation rate constants were evidently enhanced by hydrogen. The different hydrogen responses of Ci* with those of Cm* and Ca* were explained by two kinds of hydrogen activation mechanisms. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Hydrogen effects Propylene polymerization Ziegler-Natta catalyst Number of active centers Propagation rate constant Data Availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Polypropylene (PP), the second largest synthetic resin, is mainly produced by MgCl2-supported Ziegler-Natta (Z-N) catalysts with the general formula of TiCl4/Di/MgCl2-AlR3/De, where Di is a Lewis base called internal donor, and De is a Lewis base called external donor. To regulate the average molecular weight of PP to meet the requirements for its different end products, hydrogen is added in the polymerization system as an efficient and convenient chain transfer agent. It has been well documented that adding hydrogen in propylene polymerization not only depresses the PP’s molecular weight, but also alter its other chain structure parameters like content of stereochemical errors and molecular weight distribution (MWD) [1–6]. In most cases, adding hydrogen causes reduction of the PP’s isotacticity and broadening of its MWD, besides reduction in its molecular weight [1–6]. On the other hand, adding hydrogen in propylene polymerization by Z-N catalysts also strongly influences the reaction kinetics. The most prominent phenomenon of adding hydrogen in propylene polymerization is marked enhancement of the catalytic activity [1–6]. Some mechanistic models have been proposed in the past to explain this kind of activation effect. According to the model proposed by V. Busico et al. and J. C. Chadwick et al., the hydrogen added in the propylene polymerization system reacts with Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites formed after 2,1-insertion of a propylene in Ti−Pol bonds (Pol = polymeryl), leading to formation of Ti−H moiety that can be reactivated to an active site (Ti−CH2CH2CH3) after 1,2-insertion of a propylene in it [7–9]. Since the rate of 2,1-insertion is much slower than the 1,2-insertion that accounts for most of the propylene units in the produced PP chain, there is a gradual accumulation of such dormant sites in the initial stage of polymerization [10,11]. This mechanistic model has also been supported by the fact that the propylene polymerization activity can be enhanced by introducing small amount of ethylene, as the dormant sites are reactivated after quick insertion of an ethylene into Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol [12–14]. In 2002, Y. V. Kissin et al. proposed another explanation of the hydrogen activation effect [15]. According to their mechanistic model, Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites are formed via 2,1-insertion of a propylene in Ti−H, or via chain transfer of the propagation center with propylene when the propylene molecule is coordinated to the Ti atom in the secondary orientation. This kind of dormant sites can also be reactivated via its hydrogenolysis that leads to formation of Ti−H and a propane. For the lower probability of 2,1- propylene insertions in Ti−H than that of 1,2- propylene insertions, the added hydrogen can convert most dormant Ti−CH(CH3)2 sites into the active Ti−CH2CH2CH3 sites, resuming their catalytic activity. J. C. Chadwick et al. found presence of small proportion of 2,3-dimethylbutyl chain end in PP produced with MgCl2-supported Z-N catalysts [16]. This kind of saturated end group (∼CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2) was attributed to 1,2-insertion of a propylene in the Ti−CH(CH3)2 species followed by successive chain propagation. Formation of propane in the presence of hydrogen indicated hydrogenolysis of the Ti−CH(CH3)2 species [16]. It seems that the reactivation of Ti−CH(CH3)2 dormant sites by hydrogen cannot be ignored in explaining the hydrogen activation effect. By comparing the number of active centers ([C*]/[Ti] in the case of Z-N catalysts) before and after adding hydrogen in the polymerization system, it will be possible to judge the mechanism of the hydrogen activation effect. If the activation effect is solely caused by the reaction between hydrogen and Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol, it can be expected that the [C*]/[Ti] ratio will not be changed by hydrogen addition, since the dormant site with a polymer chain can be counted into the active propagation centers when a quench-labeling method is used to determine [C*] [11,17]. In this case, the activity enhancement by hydrogen is reflected in enhancement of the active center’s intrinsic reactivity expressed in propagation rate constant, k p. If the hydrogenolysis of Ti−CH(CH3)2 species is the dominant source of the activation effect, rise of [C*]/[Ti] ratio by hydrogen addition can be expected, as the product of quenching the Ti−CH(CH3)2 has low molecular weight, thus will not be counted as the active center. In this case, the changes in the active center’s intrinsic reactivity will be more complicated, since new types of active centers join in the polymerization in the presence of hydrogen. By counting the active centers using a 14CO quench-labeling method, A. A. Barabanov et al. found that adding hydrogen in propylene polymerization with MgCl2-supported Z-N catalyst caused only slight changes in [C*]/[Ti], meanwhile the active center’s average reactivity was enhanced [6]. In our previous study on the hydrogen effects based on quench-labeling the active centers by thiophen-2-carbonyl chloride (TPCC), simultaneous increase of [C*]/[Ti] and the active center’s reactivity were observed [17]. In the previous works, the active center’s reactivity was determined by the equation: (1) R p = (k p)a[C*]C Me where R p is the rate of monomer consumption (mol/s), (k p)a is apparent propagation rate constant, [C*] is the concentration of active centers, C Me is the equilibrium monomer concentration in the bulk of the reaction medium that can be readily determined. However, the true propagation rate constant k p should be calculated according to the following Eq. (2): (2) R p = k p[C*][M] where [M] is monomer concentration in the microscopic zones where the chain propagation takes place. Because [M] is smaller than C Me for the presence of monomer diffusion limitation in the polymer/catalyst particles containing the catalyst fragments and the growing polymer, the (k p)a value is actually smaller than k p [18,19]. Since the extent of monomer diffusion limitation increases with the polymer yield (g polymer/g catalyst), the experimentally determined (k p)a value was found to quickly decline with the polymerization time [19–21]. Although a rough judgement on the mechanism of hydrogen effect can be made based on the (k p)a values of propylene polymerization in the absence or presence of hydrogen, the conclusions could be misleading because of the high sensitivity of (k p)a to the kinetic features of the polymerization (e.g. polymer yield, morphology and structure of the polymer particles). To make reliable study on the hydrogen effects by counting the active centers and determining their intrinsic reactivity, it is necessary to use the true value of propagation rate constant, not the apparent constant. In a recent work, we have developed a method to estimate k p value by fitting the time-dependent changes of (k p)a value in the initial stage of propylene polymerization [19]. The change of [C*]/[Ti] with time was determined by the quenching the propylene polymerization conducted for different durations using TPCC as the quenching agent. In this work, this method was applied to determine the [C*]/[Ti] and k p values of propylene polymerization in the absence or the presence of hydrogen. By this approach, the mechanism of hydrogen effect in propylene polymerization with supported Z-N catalyst was tackled on a more quantitative base. For the important roles of hydrogen in regulating the polymer structure and reaction kinetics of propylene polymerization, such precise mechanistic study is expectable to promote the development of better catalysts and polypropylene products. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials A commercial MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst (MgCl2/Di/TiCl4, Ti content = 2.7 wt %) containing a diol ester as internal electron donor (Di) was used for polymerization. The method of catalyst preparation has been reported in patent literatures [22,23]. The cocatalyst triethylaluminum (TEA, purchased from Albemarle) was used as received. Thiophene-2-carbonyl chloride (TPCC) was purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. and distilled before use. n-Heptane was dried over 4 Å molecular sieve under dry nitrogen and refluxed over Na before use. Propylene (polymerization grade, Yangzi Petrochemical Co., Nanjing, China) was purified by molecular sieve and deoxygen agent in a gas purification system made by Dalian Samat Chemicals Co., Ltd. Cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (CHMDMS) was supplied by Linyi Lujing Chemical Co. and distilled before use. 2.2 Polymerization and quenching reaction Propylene polymerizations were performed in a 100 mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The flask was first filled with 45 mL n-heptane, heated to 60 °C and then saturated with propylene of 1 bar. Then TEA (Al/Ti=100) and the external donor CHMDMS (when used) were added in the flask. Then the weighed solid catalyst sealed in a glass tube was connected to the flask through rubber tubing, and flushed into the flask with 5 mL n-heptane. The polymerization starts at this point, and propylene gas of 1 bar pressure is continuously supplied to the flask during the reaction to keep the pressure unchanged. After polymerization for a predetermined duration (t p), TPCC in toluene was injected into the flask to quench the polymerization for predetermined duration at the same temperature. After the quenching, ethanol/HCl mixture was added to decompose the catalyst and the quencher, and the polymer was precipitated with excess of ethanol. A series of polymerization runs of different duration (namely, the period from the start point to the time of TPCC injection) were made at the same conditions. The polypropylene samples were purified by a three-step process: (1) The polymer was refluxed for 60 min in excess of alcohol/HCl mixture, then the polymer was isolated, washed, dried and weighed; (2) Each polymer sample was dissolved in hot n-octane and precipitated again; (3) The polymer was then extracted with anhydrous ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor for 12 h, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C. In the polymerization runs with hydrogen addition, 5 mL hydrogen gas was injected into the 100 mL Schlenk flask after it was filled with 45 mL n-heptane and saturated with propylene of 1 bar at 60 °C. The subsequent operations were the same as the polymerization runs without hydrogen. 2.3 Polymer fractionation Each purified polypropylene sample was fractionated into three fractions in two steps. (1) About 2 g of PP was fully dissolved in 200 mL of boiling n-octane, and then the solution was cooled to room temperature. After the polymer was fully crystallized, the suspension was separated into the solution part and solid part by centrifuging. Polymer recovered from the solution part was named as n-octane soluble part (C8-sol). (2) The solid part was first dried in vacuum and then extracted with boiling n-heptane for 12 h in a Kumagawa type Soxhlet extractor. The boiling n-heptane soluble part (C7-sol) was recovered from the solution, and the n-heptane insoluble part (C7-ins) was collected from the sample holder. All the fractions were dried in vacuum and weighed. In the industrial practice of determining PP’s stereoregularity, xylene is used as the solvent to separate the room temperature xylene soluble fraction from the insoluble part, and the content of the insoluble part is taken as an index of PP’s isotacticity. We have compared the xylene soluble content with C8-sol content of the same PP sample, and found that they were practically the same within the range of experimental error (see Table S1 of Supporting Information). Therefore, the C8-sol fraction can be considered the same as the xylene soluble fraction. 2.4 Measurements The sulfur content of the polymer fractions was measured with a GLC-200 microcoulometry sulfur analyzer (Jiangyan Yinhe Instrument Co., detection limit = 0.05 ppm). Polymer sample for the analysis was solid powder (2–4 mg, weighed to ± 0.01 mg), and three parallel measurements were made for each sample. Thermal analysis of the PP fractions was performed on a TA Q100 thermal analyzer. The polymer (about 4 mg) was sealed in aluminum pan, heated to 180 °C at 10 K/min, kept at that temperature for 5 min, and then cooled to 40 °C at 10 K/min and kept for 5 min. Then the sample was scanned from 40° to 180°C at a heating rate of 10 K/min, and the DSC trace was recorded. 13C NMR spectra of the PP fractions were measured on a Varian Mercury Plus 300 NMR spectrometer at 75 MHz. o-Dichlorobenzene-d4 was used as the solvent, and the concentration of the polymer solution was 10 wt %. The spectra were recorded at 120 °C with hexamethyldisiloxane as an internal reference. Chromium triacetylacetone (4−5 mg) was added to each sample to decrease the relaxation time and ensure quantitative results. Broadband decoupling with a pulse delay of 3 s was employed. Typically, 5000 transients were collected. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Polymerization kinetics and polymer structure A MgCl2/Di/TiCl4 type supported Z-N catalyst containing a diol ester type internal donor was used to conduct propylene polymerization in the absence or presence of small amount of hydrogen. TEA was used as the cocatalyst, and CHMDMS, a silane-type external donor (De) extensively applied in PP industry, was added to enhance the catalyst’s stereoselectivity. Two series of propylene polymerization were separately conducted for different durations ranging from 0.5 to 20 min, in which one series was conducted without hydrogen addition, and the other series was conducted with hydrogen addition. The changes of polymerization activity with time and results of polymer fractionation are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. 1, the catalysis activity quickly increased to the maximum in the initial stage, and then continuously declined in the later stage in the system with no hydrogen. When 5 mL hydrogen was added in the reactor, the activity started to decay at the beginning of the polymerization, but the decay ceased after about 5 min. This resulted in a more or less steady stage in the subsequent reaction period. Comparing the activities of the system without hydrogen and with hydrogen, one can find that the later was about 20 % more active than the former. This level of hydrogen activation effect is relatively weak as compared to those reported in literatures [3,4,6,24]. To precisely characterize the PP chain structure, each polymer sample was fractionated into three parts named as C8-sol, C7-sol and C7-ins. The C8-sol, C7-sol and C7-ins have been found to be composed of atactic PP (aPP), medium isotactic PP (mPP) and highly isotactic PP (iPP) according to our previous work [25]. 13C NMR analysis on the C7-sol and C7-ins fractions and thermal analysis on the three fractions showed that the C8-sol fraction was nearly amorphous for its very low melting enthalpy, the C7-sol fraction had medium isotacticity, and the C7-ins fraction had rather high isotacticity (see Table S2 and Table S3 of Supporting Information). According to our previous studies, these fractions are considered to be the products of three types of active centers with different stereoselectivity [25,26]. By tracing the changes of fraction distribution with time, the kinetic behaviors of the different active centers and their responses to hydrogen can be disclosed. As shown in Fig. 2, the fraction distribution of the PP product experienced marked changes with time when no hydrogen was added. In this system the weight fractions of C8-sol and C7-sol rapidly declined in the initial stage (0–10 min), meanwhile the content of C7-ins fraction was nearly doubled. In contrast, the variation of fraction distribution in the polymerization process was much milder in the presence of hydrogen. The strong influence of hydrogen on the content of C7-ins fraction can be observed more clearly in Fig. 3. It shows that hydrogen mainly influenced the C7-ins content in the first 2 min of polymerization. There was almost no difference between the C7-ins content of PP produced in the absence and presence of hydrogen when the polymerization time was longer than 10 min 3.2 Variation of active center concentration and active center distribution in the polymerization process The number of active centers of the PP fractions produced in the two polymerization series was determined by quench-labeling method using TPCC as the quencher [27], and the results are shown in Fig. 4, Table S4 and Table S5 in Supporting Information. With the proceeding of polymerization, the total number of active centers ([C*]/[Ti]) of both catalysts monotonously increased with reaction time (t p). There are distinct differences between the [C*]/[Ti] ∼ t p traces of the polymerizations with and without hydrogen. In the system without hydrogen, the [C*]/[Ti] ratio quickly increased to about 3 % in the initial 3–5 min, and then kept nearly unchanged in the subsequent reaction period. However, the [C*]/[Ti] ratio kept growing in the whole reaction period, and reached at 6.3 % after 20 min in the presence of hydrogen. Namely, adding hydrogen made the [C*]/[Ti] fraction nearly doubled. By comparing the number of active centers of the C8-sol fraction ([Ca*]/[Ti]), C7-sol fraction ([Cm*]/[Ti]) and C7-ins fraction ([Ci*]/[Ti]), the active center distribution and its response to hydrogen was studied. In the system without hydrogen, the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio roughly equals to ([Ca*]/[Ti] + [Cm*]/[Ti]) after 5 min polymerization, meaning that the highly stereoselective centers Ci* accounted for half of all the active centers in the system. Besides the steep increase of [Ci*]/[Ti] with time in the initial 1 min, number of the three kinds of active centers varied with time more or less parallelly. In contrast, in the system with hydrogen, though the [Ca*]/[Ti], [Cm*]/[Ti] and [Ci*]/[Ti] ratios increased with time parallelly in the first 2 min, the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio kept grow in the subsequent period while the [Ca*]/[Ti] and [Cm*]/[Ti] ratios ceased to increase with time. As a result, the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio was much larger than the sum of [Ca*]/[Ti] and [Cm*]/[Ti] at t p ≥ 5 min. In other words, adding hydrogen in the system evidently changed the active center distribution by enhancing the weight of Ci* in the catalyst. Comparing to the system without hydrogen, adding hydrogen slightly enhanced the [Ca*]/[Ti] and [Cm*]/[Ti] ratios, but making the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio more than doubled when the reaction period of 5–20 min was considered. The mechanism of this phenomenon will be discussed in the next section after considering the effects of hydrogen on intrinsic reactivity of the active centers. 3.3 Intrinsic reactivity of the active centers By nonlinear fitting the PP fraction yield versus t p traces, R p ∼ t p data of the PP fractions were respectively calculated from the slopes of fitting lines (see Fig. S1 ∼ Fig. S6 in Supporting Information). The (k p)a ∼ t p data were then calculated according to Eq. (1) using the [C* ]/[Ti] ∼ t p and R p ∼ t p data. The equilibrium concentration (C Me) of propylene in n-heptane reported in literature [28] was adopted in the calculation, which is 0.22 mol/L at 60 °C and 1 bar. The (k p)a ∼ t p traces of the PP fractions produced in the absence and presence of hydrogen are shown in Fig. 5 (the data can be seen in Table S4 and S5 of the Supporting Information). In both polymerization systems, the (k p)a value quickly declined with time in the initial stage (0–2 min for the system without hydrogen, and 0–5 min for the system with hydrogen), and then approached to a stationary level. As proposed in our previous work, [21] decline of the apparent propagation rate constant with time can be attributed to time-dependent rise of mass transfer hindrance in the polymer/catalyst particles, where the monomer passes through the polymer layer surrounding the catalyst fragments to reach at the active centers. In our recent work, a linear relationship as shown in Eq. (3) was established and used to estimate k p value by linear fitting/extrapolating the time-dependent change of lg(k p)a with [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 in the initial stage of olefin polymerization [19], where m p and m cat are mass of the polymer and the catalyst, ρp and ρcat are density of the polymer and the catalyst, respectively. (3) lg ( k p ) a = lg d × ρ cat m P ρ P m cat + 1 1 3 − lg d + lg k p lgk p, logarithm of the real propagation rate constant representing the intrinsic reactivity, can be estimated by extrapolating the lg(k p)a vs. [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 line to [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 = 1, where the intercept equals to lgk p. The slope of the line, lgd, represents the extent of monomer diffusion limitation in the polymer/catalyst particle. This relationship was established based on a mechanistic model assuming presence of monomer diffusion limitation inside the polymer/catalyst particle [19]. Fig. 6 shows the lg(k p)a vs. [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 traces of the PP fractions produced in the absence and the presence of hydrogen. Each trace can be divided into two parts, in which the datapoints in the initial 2 – 5 min obeyed a linear relationship, but the datapoints after 5 min of polymerization sharply deviated from the linear relationship by bending upward. In our previous work [19], all the datapoints of the lg(k p)a vs. [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 traces of propylene Z-N polymerization conducted for 0–2 min ([(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 = 2–3) followed the same linear relationship. The absence of the upward bending can be explained by their short reaction duration or small [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 values. Namely, the upward bending appears only when the [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 value exceeds a certain critical point. In order to explain the obvious bending of the experimentally determined lg(k p)a ∼ [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 traces in the period of t p = 2–5 min, here we try to modify the multi-grain particle model (MGM) proposed in our previous work [19]. In the previous MGM model, the macroscopic polymer/catalyst particle is considered as an aggregate of numerous microparticles, in which each microparticle is depicted as a core-shell sphere with a catalyst fragment as the core and the polymer phase as the shell (see the model for low m p/m cat ratio in Scheme 1). The polymer produced by the active centers on the surface of the core forms a polymer shell, which hinders the diffusion of monomer from the outer surface of the shell to the active centers on the core. When the potential monomer consumption rate is larger than the monomer diffusion rate, a monomer concentration gradient will form, making the C Mc/C Mb ratio smaller than 1 (C Mc and C Mb are monomer concentration at the core surface and shell surface, respectively). This effect will make (k p)a lower than k p, as (k p)a/k p = C Mc/C Mb. The linear relationship of Eq. (3) implies that (k p)a/k p will continuously decline with growth of the microparticle. If the relationship of Eq. (3) is strictly followed until a very large m p/m cat ratio is reached, the (k p)a value will continuously decline to a very low level approaching 0. This situation is contrary to the experimental fact that (k p)a value was stabilized to a medium level after sufficiently long period of polymerization (see Fig. 5). To solve this contradiction, the model should be expanded to two stages. The first stage is the period from the beginning of the polymerization to a relatively low m p/m cat ratio, in which the decline of (k p)a with time obeys Eq. (3). The second stage is the period from a certain critical m p/m cat ratio to longer polymerization time. At m p/m cat ratio larger than the critical point, the polymer shell may become more inhomogeneous, with formation of nano-sized cracks in the shell (see Scheme 1). These cracks reduce the effective distance of monomer diffusion in the polymer shell, resulting in slower decrease of C Mc/C Mb and thus (k p)a/k p with time. In the extreme case, the (k p)a value will cease to decline with polymerization time. The reason for this morphological change in the polymer shell at high m p/m cat ratio could be related with its spatial dimension. As reported in literatures, the average diameter of the catalyst fragments (also called the secondary particles) is smaller than 50 nm [29,30]. As [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 equals to the ratio of the polymer shell’s radius to the core’s radius [19], a [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 value of 3 corresponds to a polymer shell’s thickness of 30 nm when the core’s radius is 10 nm. It is possible that the PP phase in the polymer shell of 30 nm thickness is more or less homogeneous for the space confinement effect, but further increase of the shell’s thickness could provide sufficient space for anisotropic growth of the PP crystalline phases, producing inhomogeneous textures and even cracks in the shell. In this case, the effective distance of monomer diffusion (the dotted circle in the particle model of high m p/m cat ratio in Scheme 1) will be much shorter than the thickness of the shell part. Based on this particle model, the linear relationship of the lg(k p)a ∼ [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 trace in the range of [(ρcat m p)/(ρp m cat) + 1]1/3 = 1–3.5 was used to estimate k p values of different active centers in propylene polymerization in the absence and presence of hydrogen, and the results are shown in Table 3. The precision of the linear fitting was satisfactory in most cases. It shows that k p value of the highly isospecific active centers producing the C7-ins fraction is much larger than those of the less stereospecific centers producing the C7-sol and C8-sol fractions. Adding hydrogen caused evident reduction in k p of the active centers in C7-ins, but k p values of the active centers in C7-sol and C8-sol fractions became larger after adding hydrogen. Combining with the results of active center counting, it is clear that adding hydrogen caused evident changes in both the number of active centers and their intrinsic reactivity. 3.4 Discussions on the mechanism of hydrogen effects Based on the above presented results, here we try to rationalize the effects of hydrogen on the active centers and chain structure of the produced PP. First, the most important effect of hydrogen on propylene polymerization is activation of the dormant sites. As mentioned in the introduction part, two kinds of dormant sites have been proposed in literatures to explain the hydrogen effects. The Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites are formed after a 2,1- propylene insertion in the Ti−CH2CH(CH3)−Pol propagation center that shows normal activity for propylene coordination and 1,2- insertion. This kind of dormant sites are activated via chain transfer of Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol with hydrogen to form Ti−H, and subsequent propylene 1,2- insertion in the Ti−H to resume the active propagation center. The Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites are formed via chain transfer of a Ti−CH2CH(CH3)−Pol propagation center with monomer, and can be activated via its reaction with hydrogen to form Ti−H. Similarly, subsequent propylene insertion in the Ti−H resumes the active propagation center. In respect to the number of active centers and their reactivity (k p), activation of the Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites by hydrogen will not change the [C*]/[Ti] ratio, but will raise the k p value determined using the polymerization rate and [C*] data. It is possible that these two kinds of dormant sites coexist in the polymerization system, leading to more complicated hydrogen responses. In the propylene polymerization studied in this work, the three types of active centers, Ca*, Cm* and Ci* responded to hydrogen in different ways. The non-stereoselective centers, Ca*, experienced slight increase in the number, but remarkable increase in the intrinsic reactivity after addition of hydrogen, meaning that the activation of Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites was the dominant effect. The centers with medium stereoselectivity, Cm*, showed similar hydrogen responses, but their intrinsic reactivity was only moderately raised by hydrogen addition. In the case of Ci*, the most stereoselective active centers that account for more than 80 % of the polymer yield, the hydrogen effects showed dominance of the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites, as the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio was more than doubled by hydrogen addition. However, the intrinsic reactivity of Ci* was reduced for about 40 % by the addition of hydrogen. This phenomenon could mean that the centers activated from the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites have evidently lower intrinsic reactivity than those cannot be easily trapped in the dormant state. If the centers activated by hydrogen have stronger tendency to be transformed to Ti−CH(CH3)2 via chain transfer with propylene, their net chain propagation rate will be slower than the centers that are seldomly trapped in the dormant state, as the normal chain propagation will be interrupted by the side reactions of entering dormancy and reactivation from dormancy. Therefore, it is more understandable that the centers activated by hydrogen have lower k p value than those centers that keep active in the absence of hydrogen. It is worth noting that the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio of propylene polymerization without hydrogen went to a stationary level after gradual increase in the first 2 min, while the [Ci*]/[Ti] ratio of propylene polymerization with hydrogen kept increasing from the beginning until 20 min (see Fig. 4). Meanwhile, the numbers of Ca* and Cm* stopped increase with time irrespective of the presence of hydrogen. If the continuous increase of [Ci*]/[Ti] in the 20 min polymerization with hydrogen is solely attributed to activation of the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites, the explanation looks not so reasonable, because the process of Ti−CH(CH3)2 activation seems to be too slow. To explain the phenomenon more reasonably, another factor should be considered. As reported in our previous work, the extent of catalyst particle disintegration and thus the amount of released active centers strongly depends on the polymerization rate per unit catalyst weight [11]. In the polymerization systems of this work, the polymerization rate was enhanced for more than 20 % by addition of hydrogen. This increase in polymer growth rate can lead to further disintegration of the catalyst particles and release more potential active centers that are otherwise buried inside the catalyst. The lower increments of [Ca*]/[Ti] and [Cm*]/[Ti] than that of [Ci*]/[Ti] in the period of 5–20 min in the polymerization with hydrogen mean that a part of the stereoselective active centers are more firmly imbedded in the catalyst’s nanosized cracks, which can only be released after larger extent of catalyst disintegration. Similar phenomenon has been found in our previous work [11]. Therefore, in the polymerization with hydrogen, the activation of Ti−CH(CH3)2 dormant sites by hydrogen caused faster growth of polymer in the catalyst particle, which induced further disintegration of the particle and released more potential active sites. The combined effects caused continuous increase of [Ci*]/[Ti] in the later stage of polymerization. Summarizing the above discussions, the highly stereoselective active centers Ci* showed remarkably different hydrogen response in comparison with the two types of less stereoselective active centers Cm* and Ca*. A high fraction of Ci* have strong tendency to be trapped in the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites, while the propagation centers of Cm* and Ca* suffer from frequent 2,1- propylene insertion that leads to the Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites. This phenomenon could be largely attributed to the marked stereoselectivity/regioselectivity gaps between these two groups of active centers. In propylene polymerization with heterogeneous Z-N catalysts, plenty of experimental results show a positive correlation between the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity [12–14]. The catalysts with high stereoselectivity usually present high regioselectivity, namely, show low frequency of 2,1- insertion. This general trend could also exist in different types of active centers of the same catalyst. The markedly higher content of the Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites in Cm* and Ca* than that in Ci* could be explained for this reason. However, the higher importance of the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites in Ci* than in Cm* and Ca* is still hard to be understood for lack of sufficient knowledge on the formation mechanism of Ti−CH(CH3)2. It should be noticed that the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of supported Z-N catalysts change widely depending on the type of internal electron donor added in the catalyst and external donor added in the polymerization system [11–14]. Consequently, hydrogen responses of propylene polymerization with Z-N catalysts are strongly affected by the type of electron donor [12–14,31]. M. Z. Gao et al. have reported that the Z-N catalysts containing diol ester type internal donor show many unique features in comparison with the conventional Z-N catalysts containing phthalate type internal donor [32]. Our previous work also shows that the Z-N catalyst containing a phthalate type internal donor has higher fraction of Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites than the catalyst containing a diol ester internal donor, implying lower regioselectivity in the former system [11]. Therefore, different laws of hydrogen effect could be existing in Z-N catalysts containing other types of internal donor. 4 Conclusions In propylene polymerization with the MgCl2-supported Z-N catalyst containing diol ester internal donor, the three types of active centers, the centers with high stereoselectivity (Ci*), medium stereoselectivity (Cm*) and very low stereoselectivity (Ca*), responded to addition of hydrogen in different ways. Addition of small amount of hydrogen caused marked increase of [Ci*]/[Ti], but the chain propagation rate constant of Ci*(k pi) declined evidently by the hydrogen addition. In contrast, numbers of the two types of less stereoselective active centers (Cm* and Ca*) were only slightly affected by hydrogen, but their propagation rate constants were evidently raised by hydrogen. For the opposite directions of hydrogen effects on the number and propagation rate constant of Ci* that accounted for mora than 85 % of the PP product, the net increment of polymerization activity caused by hydrogen was relatively small (about 20 % activity increment after 20 min polymerization). The evidently different hydrogen responses of the active centers with high stereoselectivity and those with lower stereoselectivity mean that two types of hydrogen activation effects coexist in the polymerization system. It can be proposed that the highly stereoselective centers Ci* have strong tendency to be trapped in the Ti−CH(CH3)2 type dormant sites, while the less stereoselective centers (Cm* and Ca*) suffer from frequent 2,1- propylene insertion that leads to the Ti−CH(CH3)CH2−Pol type dormant sites.

Three types of active centers with high, medium and very low stereoselectivity were differentiated by fractionating the polymer into three parts. Chain propagation rate constant of each type of active centers was estimated by linear fitting/extrapolating the time-dependent change of apparent propagation rate constant. The centers with high (Ci*), medium (Cm*) and low (Ca*) stereoselectivity responded to addition of hydrogen differently. Adding hydrogen caused marked increase of Ci*, but its propagation rate constant (k pi) was evidently reduced. In contrast, numbers of Cm* and Ca* were only slightly affected, but their propagation rate constants were evidently enhanced by hydrogen. The different hydrogen responses of Ci* with those of Cm* and Ca* were explained by two kinds of hydrogen activation mechanisms.",
