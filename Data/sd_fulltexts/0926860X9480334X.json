The reducibility of the promoted and unpromoted catalysts was investigated by temperature-programmed reduction. In all cases the added oxide promoter enhanced the specific activity and the selectivity for alkenes and long chain hydrocarbons. These results are discussed on the basis of a general mechanism of promotion.

Introduction In the carbon monoxide hydrogenation reaction, promoters are generally added to the metallic active phase to achieve, in this way, an enhanced catalytic activity and/or a higher selectivity with respect to alkenes, long-chain hydrocarbons or oxygenated compounds. Thus, industrial Fischer-Tropsch catalysts are normally multicomponent systems containing one or more promoters, in addition to the supported metals. Much attention has been paid to the production of oxygenated compounds, for example on VZOg promoted rhodium catalysts [ 1 ] , in which the * Corresponding author. Tel. ( +34-1) 3987344, fax.

Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 promoter induces the formation of alcohols with more than one carbon atom. In addition, the hydrocarbon formation from synthesis gas has been widely studied in order to produce desired hydrocarbon fractions. The more classic promoters for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction are alkaline oxides (particularly potassium), which are added in small amounts to supported metals (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) [ 2 ] . These promoters improve the selectivity to alkenes and long-chain hydrocarbons but decrease the total activity of the catalysts [ 3,4] . More recently, it has been discovered that many metal oxides exert an influence on carbon monoxide hydrogenation over supported metals. For instance, vanadium, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, lanthanum, thorium or cerium oxides cause an increase of the total activity and shifts in the selectivity when they are promoting Ru, Rh, Co or Ni catalysts [ 5-10] . The promotion effect of these oxides has been attributed to two phenomena: (i) the presence of partially reduced promoter oxides which provide binding sites for the oxygen end of the carbon monoxide molecule facilitating its dissociation [ 11 ] and (ii) the coverage of the surface of the active phase by the promoter resulting in a decreased chemisorption capacity and in a restricted mobility of the adsorbed species [5,12]. These two explanations do not exclude one another but the first possibility depends on the redox properties of the oxide promoter. To study the metal-oxide promoter interactions, the use of carbons as support offers two interesting characteristics: (i) the high surface area of these materials that allows to obtain highly dispersed catalytic phases and (ii) the weak metalcarbon or promoter-carbon interactions that can favour a better metal-promoter interaction. However, few works have been carried out in this line. Recently, Barrault et al. [ 12] reported that lanthanum or cerium promotion of a carbonsupported cobalt catalyst improves the total activity and increases the selectivity to alkenes and higher hydrocarbons. On the other hand, by temperature-programmed desorption of carbon monoxide it has been shown that oxide promoters (MgO, V205, or Ce02) have a noticeable effect on the metal-CO bond in Ru/C and Co/ C catalysts [ 13 ] . Of the transition metals, ruthenium and cobalt are known as very active catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [ 14] . When supported on carbon, both metals are characterized by a high specific activity and a high selectivity to methane, and by the absence of secondary reactions (water-gas shift reaction, carbon monoxide disproportionation, etc.) [ 15-19 ] . Alternatively, the metal precursor (inorganic salts, carbonyls, etc.) can affect the physico-chemical properties of the supported metallic clusters. However, very little information about the influence of the metal precursor in the metal-promoter interaction can be found in the scientific literature. In the present paper a comparative study of the catalytic properties of Ru/C and Co/C catalysts promoted with various metal oxides (MgO, V205, or Ce02) in carbon monoxide hydrogenation is carried out. The carbon-supported cobalt catalysts were prepared from cobalt(II) nitrate and Co2(CO)g. The reducibility of the catalysts was investigated by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Infor- A.

A comparison of carbon monoxide hydrogenation activity and selectivity with previous hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption results [ 13] is made. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparations The support material was a commercial activated carbon (Merck), which was purified by treatment with acid solutions (HCI, H2F2) to remove inorganic materials and by thermal treatment at 1223 K to decompose the residual functional groups [13]. The carbon so treated had an apparent surface area (SBET N2 at 77 K) of 1100 m2 g-'. Aliquots of this activated carbon were impregnated with aqueous solutions of Mg (N03) 2, (NH4) V03 or Ce(N03)3 to introduce the different promoters. After being dried in air at 390 K, the precursors were decomposed in flowing nitrogen at 698 K. The cobalt catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the carrier with a solution of Co(N03)2-6H20in ethanol orC02(CO)8in pentane, either with promoter or promoter-free. The samples prepared from the cobalt nitrate precursor were dried in air, but those prepared from the carbonyl were heated in flowing argon at 673 K. Ruthenium catalysts were prepared by impregnation with a RuCIOH20 solution in ethanol. Before chemisorption measurements and catalytic tests, the samples were `in situ' reduced in flowing hydrogen at 673 K for 12 h. Table 1 summarizes the hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption results obtained for the various samples and the metallic dispersion evaluated from them. Details about the chemical analysis, the chemisorption data, X-ray diffraction and 74 A. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on these catalysts have previously been reported [ 13 ] . 2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction Catalysts were pretreated in helium at 423 K for 1 h. A high purity mixture of 5% hydrogen in helium was passed through the samples placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor (I.D. 4 mm). The sample was held between two quartz wool plugs. The temperature of the reactor was monitored by a thermocouple placed in contact with the external wall of the quartz tube and controlled by a Minicor 41 programmable temperature controller. The temperature of the sample was increased from 400 to 1000 K using a linear temperature program (3 K min'). The effluents of the reactor were monitored by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3400) provided with a thermal conductivity detector, an automatic sample injection and a Porapak Q column. Individual analyses were performed at intervals of 4 min. As some gasification of the support can take place during reduction of carbon-supported metal catalysts [ 20] , not only the hydrogen consumption was followed but also the methane generated. 2.3. Carbon monoxide hydrogenation The catalytic behaviour of the samples in the carbon monoxide hydrogenation was studied in a U-shaped pyrex reactor at 100 kPa, 480-550 K and HZ/CO = 2. The catalysts were prereduced for 12 h at 673 K in a 50 cm' min-' hydrogen flow before cooling in hydrogen to the reaction temperature. The reaction was conducted at a large high velocity ( > 1000 h-') and small conversion ( < 10%) to minimize the influences of heat and mass transfer. Gas flows were measured and controlled by mass-flowmeters (Brooks). The mixture of gases coming out from the reactor was analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph, model 5890A, using a Chromosorb 102 column and with a flame ionization detector to determine the hydrocarbons and a thermal conductivity detector to determine the carbon dioxide and unreacted carbon monoxide. Previously, this system was calibrated with standard gas mixtures (Supelco). The data were used to determine the specific activity of the catalysts (/.tmol carbon monoxide consumed per gram of metal per second) and the molar fraction of each hydrocarbon produced (up to CS) . 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption Table 1 summarizes the data of hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption onto the different catalysts. It is observed that the catalysts have rather high metallic A. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71--83 75 dispersion (D) considering the metal content (between 3 and 7%) and the weak metal-support interaction of these catalysts. Discrepancies between the metallic dispersions calculated from hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption can be attributed to the adsorption stoichiometries considered. Thus, it is assumed that a carbon monoxide molecule binds to one surface metal atom. However, it is well established [ 17] that formation of subcarbonyl species on the smaller metal crystallites can occur. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the case of the Co/ C catalyst. Alternatively, the hydrogen chemisorption can be a kinetically activated process, the amount of adsorbed hydrogen being smaller than that corresponding to one hydrogen atom per surface metal atom [ 13,15 ] . Both effects contribute to H/CO ratios in the range of 0.3 to 0.7. On the other hand, the samples containing ceria as promoter display the highest amount of chemisorbed hydrogen within each one of the three series. This fact can be explained as being due to the formation, during the reduction pretreatment, of nonstoichiometric cerium oxides [ 21 ] which would be subsequently able to incorporate hydrogen into the oxide bulk [ 22] giving, e. g. Ce02Hx (x = 0.17) . 3.2. Temperature-programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction was applied to investigate the metal-promoter interaction on carbon-supported catalysts. The TPR profiles of the carbon support loaded with the various promoters are presented in Fig. 1. Prior to the TPR experiments the samples were heated in nitrogen at 673 K in order to decompose the metal oxide precursors. The most significant characteristic of the three promoterloaded carbon TPR profiles is a high-intensity peak ranging from about 600 to 1000 K. For V205/C and Ce02/Csamples this peak is ascribed to the bulk reduction of V205 and Ce02crystallites, the reduction finishing with the formation of V3+ [23] or Ce3+ species [24,25], respectively. In the case of the Ce02/C sample, two reduction steps can be distinguished between 550 and 1000 K. Consequently, the consumption of hydrogen at lower temperatures (550-700 K) can be due to the reduction of surface ions, while the more intense peak at higher temperatures (7001000 K) can be due to the elimination of bulk oxygen anions. The V205/C Sample (Fig. lb) also exhibits a low-intensity reduction peak at 480 K which can be ascribed to the reduction of surface V5+ ions to V4+ or V + species. Concerning the Mg0/C sample (Fig. la), the hydrogen consumption at temperatures between 650 and 1000 K may be associated to reductive decomposition of carbonate and/ or hydroxyl groups, which are present on the surface of strongly basic oxides. Moreover, the formation of oxygen vacancies at the surface of MgO crystallites can contribute to this peak, but a reduction of Mg'+ to Mgis not expected. On the other hand, in every case the formation of methane was not detected during the TPR experiments. This fact indicates that MgO, V205, Ce02 and their partially reduced oxides do not catalyze the gasification of the carbon support and that metallic species are not formed under hydrogen treatment. 76 A.

Fig. 2 displays the reduction curves for the carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts, dried at 390 K. The profile for the Ru/C catalyst shows a strong analogy with the data of Blanchard et al. [ 26] for Ru/Si02. Thus, the hydrogen consumption at 460 K corresponds to the reduction of Ru3+ to Ru Moreover, hydrogen consumption is observed over a wide temperature range, from 600 to 1000 K, which is accompanied by the formation of methane; the maximum formation of methane occurring at 800 K. It appears that, as in the case of various carbon-supported metal catalysts [ 20 ] , a process of carbon gasification occurs. Comparison of the metal oxide-promoted ruthenium catalysts with the Ru/C counterpart (Fig. 2) shows that the reduction of Ru3+ to Rutakes place at the same temperature. However, in relation with the formation of methane, a second A. Guerrero-Ruiz et at. !Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 _ 400 500 600 700 T\\K 900 800 600 700 800 900 TK Fig. 2.

Solid line: hydrogen consumption; dotted line: generated methane. well defined peak appears with the added metal oxide promoters, while the peak at higher temperature is markedly decreased. Hence, the major production of methane occurs at 600 and 800 K, the first peak being particularly intense in the case of the Ru,MgO/C catalyst. The methane at the lower temperature could be formed by hydrogenation of the carbon dioxide coming from thermal decomposition of the surface carbonate groups on the metal oxide promoters. This interpretation would be supported by the methane curve obtained for the Ru,MgO/C, which is precisely the most basic oxide among the oxide promoters used and therefore that with the largest amount of surface carbonates. On the other hand, the decreased methane formation at higher temperatures over the promoted catalysts in comparison with the Ru / C catalyst indicates that ruthenium particles interacting with oxide promoter are less efficient for carbon gasification. This fact can be ascribed to a lower mobility of the ruthenium particles when they are in contact with the oxide promoters and/ or to a lower quantity of carbon atoms near the ruthenium particles when the oxide promoter is present. Finally, the hydrogen consumption at temperatures between 600 and 700 K on Ru,V205/C and Ru,Ce02/C(Figs. 2c and 2d) can be reasonably assigned to the reduction process of the oxide promoter. Yet, the ceria-promoted catalyst exhibits a shoulder at the higher temperature side of the ruthenium reduction peak (at 550 K), which could be due to the reduction of surface Ce4+ ions by hydrogen atoms generated on the metallic ruthenium particles. Comparison with the profiles of the ruthenium-free samples (Fig. 1) reveals that ruthenium facilitates the oxide pro- a 1* l 800 900 1000 400 500 600 1000 400 500 600 700 T1K 77 700 800 900 7000 T\\K 500 900 1000 78 A.

These results along with the above exposed indicate that metalpromoter interaction exists in these oxide-promoted ruthenium catalysts. The TPR profiles of the carbon-supported cobalt catalysts prepared from the nitrate precursor and dried at 398 K are displayed in Fig. 3. The curve of the Co/ C catalyst (Fig. 3a) shows two maximum hydrogen consumption peaks at 620 and 730 K, which correspond to the reduction of C0304 in two stages [ 9,27,28 ] ; Co3 + _+ Co2+ -), Coo. Moreover, there is the contribution of the methane formation at 600 and 800 K stemming from the carbon support gasification. Beside these, a low intensity hydrogen consumption peak appears at 500 K, which could correspond to the reductive decomposition of cobalt nitrate precursor remains [ 27 ] . Comparison of the promoted cobalt catalysts with the unpromoted counterpart reveals that the presence of the oxide promoters modified neither the cobalt oxide reduction process nor the carbon gasification. The peak at 500 K is particularly intense in the Co,MgO/C catalyst, very likely because nitrate species are stabilized on the magnesium oxide surface, whereas on the other promoted samples these species easily decompose during the drying pretreatment. On the other hand, comparison of promoted cobalt catalysts with the metal oxide-loaded carbons free of cobalt (Fig. 1) shows that cobalt shifts the reduction of the oxide promoters to lower temperatures. Similar behaviour was found for the ruthenium catalysts. Analysis of the TPR profiles of the different samples reveals that reduction temperature of cobalt or ruthenium oxides is little affected by the presence of the A. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 79 oxide promoters. In contrast, the partial reduction of both V205 and Ce02 was easier with the incorporation of metallic cobalt or ruthenium. In the light of these results and of recent XPS studies on these samples [ 13 ] , it can be concluded that, after reduction, metallic ruthenium or cobalt particles are in close vicinity of the oxide promoters. Moreover, on reduced M,V205/C and M,Ce02/C (M = Co or Ru) catalysts, the formation of V3+ and Ce3+ ions is expected, as in fact detected by XPS [ 13 ] . 3.3. Carbon monoxide hydrogenation The specific activities and product distribution presented in this paper represent the steady-state performance of the catalysts and refer to a period of about 30-400 min after the CO/H2 mixture was introduced into the reactor. Table 2 lists the catalytic results of the ruthenium catalysts. It is seen that the Ru/C catalyst exhibits a near total selectivity for methane. The only other product was carbon dioxide. As no deactivation during reaction was observed, it seems that carbon dioxide mainly originates from the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H20 _+ C02 + H2), instead of carbon monoxide disproportionation (2C0 __* C02 + C). These observations agree with previous results of carbon monoxide hydrogenation on unpromoted ruthenium catalysts supported over carbonaceous materials [ 15,16,18 ] . The addition of magnesium, vanadium or cerium oxide to the Ru/C catalyst modifies its behaviour in the carbon monoxide hydrogenation as follows. First, the specific activity was considerably increased, whereby vanadium oxide had the most significant promoting effect. These results agree with those on ruthenium/alumina catalysts promoted by the oxides of vanadium and cerium [ 5,29,30] . The promotion effect has been explained in terms of the newly formed active sites (metal-promoter ensembles) at which the carbon monoxide is bonded with its carbon atom to a metal atom and with its oxygen atom to a partially reduced promoter ion [31,32]. This arrangement results in a weakening of the C-O bond, and so in enhanced dissociation and reaction of carbon monoxide.

Secondly, the product distribution was shifted to long-chain hydrocarbons and alkenes, in which the vanadium oxide added had the most pronounced effect. Similar results have been observed on ruthenium /alumina catalysts promoted by vanadium oxide [ 30] and by basic additives [ 3,33 ] . It is considered that higher hydrocarbons are produced via the polymerization of (CHx)ad species followed by the hydrogenation of the surface hydrocarbons precursors [ 34,35 ] , therefore both an increase of the rate constant for the C-0 bond dissociation and/or a decrease of the hydrogenation rate of surface carbon species can contribute to the enhanced formation of long chain hydrocarbons. Moreover, a decreased hydrogenation rate, which could be related with a lower population and mobility of hydrogen atoms over the oxide promoted catalysts, may facilitate the formation of olefinic hydrocarbons. As shown in Table 1, metal oxides added to the Ru/C catalyst, with the exception of Ce02 for the reasons above adduced, decreased the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen. In short, magnesium, vanadium and cerium oxides, although to a different extent, are favourable promoters for the production of long-chain hydrocarbons and alkenes from the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over ruthenium/carbon catalyst. The catalytic properties of the promoted and unpromoted cobalt catalysts, both ex-nitrate and ex-carbonyl, are compared in Table 3. The addition of magnesium, vanadium and cerium oxides to a carbon-supported cobalt catalyst also significantly promoted the activity up to eight times (Co,,,MgO/C catalyst) as compared to that of the unpromoted one (Co./C), and shifted the product distribution to alkenes and long chain hydrocarbons. In contrast to that found for the ruthenium catalysts, A. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 81 the vanadium oxide added is not the most efficient promoter and it is difficult to establish which one is the best oxide promoter. Thus, the highest increase in activity with respect Co/C and Coc/C catalysts was observed on Co,Ce02/C and Coc,MgO/C catalysts, respectively. However, the highest selectivity to alkenes was obtained over Co,MgO/C and Coc,VOx/C catalysts. The explanation of the differences between ruthenium and cobalt catalysts could lie in the reducibility of each metal. While ruthenium is expected to be in the form of Ruirrespectively of the oxide promoter added, the fraction of cobalt reduced to Coo is known to be dependent on the oxide promoter which is combined with it [ 9 ] . Furthermore, the presence of non-reduced cobalt species changes the nature of the adsorption sites for carbon monoxide [36] and induces variations in the catalytic behaviour [36-38], in the form of selfpromotion. Other parameters such as the dispersion of metallic cobalt and the proportion of cobalt particles in contact with those of the oxide promoter can really affect the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. Nevertheless, the results in Table 3 indicate that the promotion of cobalt by metal oxides is effective independently of the metal precursor, nitrate or carbonyl, and that promotion is a very general phenomenon including metal oxides with very different characteristics, basic character as Mg0 and Ce02or redox properties as V205 and Ce02. To obtain additional information about the metal-oxide promoter interaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over a physical mixture of the unpromoted catalyst (Ru/C or Co/C) and the metal oxide-loaded carbon (Mg0/C, V205/C or Ce02/C)was studied. It was found that in all cases the specific activities and selectivities correspond to those of the unpromoted catalysts. This finding clearly illustrates that the promotion effect requires a close proximity between the active metallic phase and the oxide promoter. Recently, in an attempt to rationalize the promotion effects in carbon monoxide hydrogenation [ 39 ] , the mechanisms of promotion have been classified as follows: (I) A through-the-metal interaction - The promoter changes the electronic pop ulation of the metal particles. (I1) A through-the-vacuum interaction - There are two possibilities: (a) an influence of the electrostatic field created by the promoter on the adsorbed species, and (b) a localized chemical interaction between the promoter and the adsorbed species. (III) Creation of new sites - the promoter stabilizes unreduced centres of the catalytic metal. The results presented in this work can hardly be explained in terms of the mechanisms (I) and (III). Thus, it is difficult to imagine that a net transfer of electrons to or from the metal particles is analogous for different metals (ruthenium, cobalt ex-nitrate and cobalt ex-carbonyl) and promoters (MgO, V205, Ce02), as expected from the similar trend in catalytic properties. Moreover, the creation of new sites with similar catalytic performance from distinct metals and metal oxides is rather unlikely. However, a plausible interpretation can be made in the light of the 82 A. Guerrero-Ruiz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 120 (1994) 71-83 `through-the-vacuum effect', which seems to be a more general mechanism to explain the action of various oxide promoters. 4. Conclusions The results presented in this study show that the specific activity and selectivity to alkenes and long chain hydrocarbons of carbon-supported ruthenium or cobalt catalysts in the carbon monoxide hydrogenation are markedly enhanced by the addition of a number of oxide promoters (MgO, V205, Ce02). Temperatureprogrammed reduction experiments indicate that in all cases a real metal-oxide promoter interaction exits. This is mainly revealed by a shift of the oxide promoter reduction peak to lower temperatures. Interpretations about the role of promoters in the migration of hydrogen species and in the carbon monoxide dissociation process have been advanced. Moreover, it is suggested that the promotion effect of various metal oxides with different basic and redox properties should be explained on the basis of a general mechanism. The influence of the electrostatic field of the nearest neighbour of the promoter on the species bound to the metal particles, could be a plausible picture to understand the action of promoters.
