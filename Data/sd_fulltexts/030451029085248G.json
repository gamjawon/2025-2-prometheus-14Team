SIVARAJ, S. T. SRINIVAS, V. NAGESHWAR RAO and P. KANTA RAO** Catalysis Section, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received October 26,1989; revised March 13, 1990) Catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone is an industrially important reaction in the production of caprolactam. Copper- based catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol [I], which is produced either by hydrogenation of phenol or by air oxidation of cyclo- hexane. The catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol has gained much importance in recent years [2-4]. For example, Sideltseva and Erofeev [2] have studied the dependence of the metal deposition procedure on the specific surface and catalytic properties of Cu/MgO catalysts. Petrova et al. [3] have examined the promotional role of cadmium in Cu A^Oa alloy catalysts. They achieved about 87% cyclohexanone selectivity at a reaction temperature of 370 C. More recently, copper-based catalysts have been studied in the dehydrogenation [5] and oxidative dehydrogena- tion [6] of cyclohexanol. Cyclohexene is one of the byproducts of the reaction [5,7]. However, the characteristics of the catalysts that govern the selectivity of the reaction is not known. In the present communication we present results on the dependence of the selectivity to cyclohexanone or cyclohexene in the reaction of cyclohexanol on the acidity and metal area of highly active copper-alumina catalysts prepared by a novel co- precipitation method. The acidity of the catalysts was measured by chemi- sorption of ammonia at room temperature, and the copper area was deter- mined by adsorptive decomposition of nitrous oxide. Copper-alumina catalysts of varying composition (12-31 wt.% Cu) have been prepared using the urea hydrolysis procedure [8, 9]. In a typical experiment, a solution containing the required amounts of copper(II) nitrate, aluminium(III) nitrate and urea was heated at 90 - 95 C. After the precipitation was completed (pH 7.5), the solids were filtered, washed with distilled* water and dried at 110 C for 24 h. The oxide catalysts were *IICT Communication No.: 2487. ** Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L24 obtained by calcining the catalyst precursors at 400 C for 24 h. The cop- per content of the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spec- trometry. Activity measurements were made in a fixed bed flow microreactor operating under normal atmospheric pressure. For each run about 0.5 g of the catalyst with an average particle size of 0.6 mm was loaded in a borosilicate glass reactor of 10 mm i.d and reduced at 250 C for 5 h in H; flow. The activities were measured at 250 C on the reduced catalyst, main- taining a cyclohexanol flow rate of 0.25 mol h~1. The products were ana- lyzed by gas chromatography using a S.S. column filled with 10% Carbowax 20M (2 m X 3 mm). The reaction products analysed were mainly cyclo- hexanone and cyclohexene. A conventional glass high vacuum system was used to measure the BET surface areas by nitrogen adsorption at 196 C. The same system, having a stationary background vacuum of 10~6 torr (1 torr = 133.3 Pa), was em- ployed to carry out NH3 chemisorption measurements. In a typical experi- ment, about 0.5 g of the catalyst sample was placed in a glass adsorption cell and evacuated at 110 C (10~6 torr) for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature (25 C) under vacuum prior to NH3 adsorption measurements. The first adsorption isotherm, representing both reversible and irreversible ammonia adsorption, was generated allowing 20 min equilibration time at each pressure. Then the catalyst was evacuated at 25 C for 1 h to remove reversibly adsorbed ammonia. After this, a fresh second isotherm, repre- senting only the reversibly adsorbed ammonia, was generated in an identical manner. From the difference between the first and second adsorption isotherms, the irreversibly chemisorbed ammonia was calculated. Helium was used to measure the dead volume. Specific copper area of the catalysts was determined by reaction with nitrous oxide at room temperature using chromatographic pulse technique according to the procedure described by Evans et al. [10] and modified by Denise et al. [11]. Each catalyst was reduced in a stream of hydrogen at 250 C for 5 h, followed by cooling to 25 C in helium flow for 1 h prior to the nitrous oxide decomposition experiment. The number of surface Cu atoms of the catalysts was calculated from N30 decomposition data. Composition, activity and selectivities along with BET surface area, ammonia uptake, copper area and XRD data of calcined catalysts are given in Table 1. Activity of the catalysts increased with increasing copper loading up to 23.6 wt.%, and then declined with further copper loading. The cyclo- hexanone selectivity increased with copper loading, while cyclohexane selectivity decreased. The cyclohexanone selectivity varied between 70.2 to 93.8% depending on the copper content in the catalyst, and the cyclo- hexanone selectivity increased with copper loading, while cyclohexene coprecipitated Cu Al203 catalysts have shown higher activity in the dehy- drogenation of cyclohexanol than the Cu ZnO Al^O^ catalysts prepared by deposition-precipitation [5]. However, the latter catalysts have shown higher selectivities for cyclohexanone.

Dependence of the rate of dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol on the number of surface Cu atoms per unit area of the copper-alumina catalysts. of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene for various catalysts as a function of copper loading are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the ammonia uptake decreases with increasing Cu loading. Meanwhile, the selectivity L27 to cyclohexanone increases when increasing the Cu loading, and conse- quently the selectivity to cyclohexene decreases. The dependence of the dehydrogenation rate of cyclohexanol on the number of surface Cu atoms per unit area is depicted in Fig. 2. It can be observed from Fig. 2 that the dehydrogenation rate increases with increasing numbers of surface Cu atoms. The dehydrating activity of 7-A1203 is well known [8,12]. When copper is added, the dehydrogenation activity rises, which is shown to depend on the copper content. Alumina produces mainly cyclohexene by the dehydration of cyclohexanol on the acidic sites of the catalyst [7]. Recently Corma et al. demonstrated that the acidity of aluminas could be measured by ambient-temperature NH3 chemisorption [13]. Hirschler has demonstrated that adding metal ions to silica-alumina replaced strong acid sites with weak acids sites [14]. It is reported that in the CuO-alumina system copper complexes are formed with Cu3\"*\", Cu2'*' and Cu\"1\" depending on the composition and thermal treatment [15,16] and Cu2\"1\" complexes are grouped into clusters on the support surface [17]. From a FT-IR study, Busca demonstrated that the CuO surface displays a basic character [18], which was deduced from the relevant stability of the surface carbonate species deriving either from the relative adsorption of carbon oxides or being residual from the preparation procedures. In Fig. 1 it can be seen that the large amount of ammonia chemisorbed at the lowest Cu loading studied, decreases with increasing copper loading in the catalysts. The results on ammonia uptake capacities of these catalysts, which is a measure of their acidity, are in agreement with the findings that the CuO surface displays a basic character. As the copper loading in the catalyst increases, the acidic sites of alumina are neutralized by the basicity of CuO, as evi- denced by the decrease in ammonia uptake. The correlation observed in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrates that the selectivity to cyclohexene depends on the acidity of the catalyst. Furthermore, the selectivity to cyclohexanone increases with decreasing acidity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalysts depends on the Cu loading, exhibiting a maximum at 23.6 wt.% Cu. Interestingly, at this Cu loading CuO, CuAl204 and 7^203 phases have been detected by XRD, while the catalysts with lower copper content do not show the presence of crystalline phases by XRD. According to Wolberg and Roth [20], the direct formation of a CuAl204 surface phase can occur even at 300 C when there is an appropriate combination of copper concentration and alumina surface area. It was shown that metallic copper species is the probable active site for the dehydrogenation activity of copper-based catalysts [5, 9, 19]. From Fig. 2 it is clear that the activity of Cu Al203 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclo- hexanone is dependent on the number of surface Cu atoms per unit BET area. Thus from the present study, the Cu Al203 catalysts prepared by coprecipitation using the urea hydrolysis procedure appear to be highly active for the reaction of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone and cyclohexene. L28 Room temperature ammonia chemisorption appears to be a promising technique for rapidly assessing the Cu Al^Oy catalysts for their relative selectivity to cyclohexanone and cyclohexene in the reaction of cyclo- hexanol.
