Graphical abstract The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over calcined, and reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in the presence and the absence of SO2 in the CH4–O2 reaction feed. XPS analysis revealed that the presence of Pt(0) may be necessary to prevent the interactions between SO2 and Pd surface species. Long time catalytic tests showed that the activity of a reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for CH4–O2 reactions remained rather unaffected despite the presence of SO2 in the feed. Evolution of T 50 for methane on the CH4 +O2 reaction, with the number of temperature-programmed reaction cycles over reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, and calcined 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. Feed: 2000ppmV CH4, 10% O2, 50ppmV SO2, balance N2. The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over calcined and reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in the presence and the absence of SO2 in the CH4–O2 reaction feed. The effect of sulfation (SO2 +O2 for 4h at 500°C) was also studied on the catalyst resistance to deactivation by sulfur poisoning. Sulfating the calcined Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a strong deactivation for the CH4–O2 reaction. However, the catalytic activity of the reduced-sulfated Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for CH4–O2 reaction remained rather unaffected in the presence and in the absence of SO2 in the reaction feed. XPS analysis revealed, over reduced-sulfated Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the presence of Pt(0) metallic surface species on which SO2 interactions may be faster related to Pd surface species. The presence of Pt(0) may be necessary to prevent the interactions between SO2 and Pd surface species. Long time catalytic tests showed that the activity of a reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for CH4–O2 reactions remained rather unaffected despite the presence of SO2 in the reaction feed. Keywords Methane oxidation NGV's emissions Pt–Pd catalysts Sulfur deactivation resistance 1 Introduction Catalytic oxidation of methane under oxygen-rich conditions has received considerable attention. One of the reasons is the increasing interest in lean-burn natural gas vehicles (NGVs). Compared with diesel engines, NGV engines produce less NO x and particulates [1–3]. However, a problem with NGV engines is the high level of unburned methane in the exhaust. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, it is important to reduce the amount emitted into the atmosphere. One approach to abating methane emission is the use of catalytic exhaust converters, in which the abatement is achieved by catalytic oxidation. Another application for catalytic oxidation of methane is in catalytic gas turbine combustors [4,5]. Instead of combusting the fuel homogeneously using a flame, the fuel is combusted over the catalysts. In this way, the combustion temperature is considerably reduced, and the formation of thermal NO x is decreased. Natural gas is a frequently used fuel in gas turbines, and the major combustible component in natural gas is methane. A catalyst that often has been used for these applications is palladium supported on various washcoats [6]. Many studies have shown that the activity over fresh palladium-supported catalysts have poor stability for methane conversion when the temperature is kept constant [7–11]. The initial high activity when the catalysts are fresh, drops significantly during operation, resulting in increasing difficulty in igniting the methane at desirable temperatures. High concentrations of water vapor strongly inhibit the activity and also cause irreversible deactivation [6,12]. Moreover, sulfur containing compounds induce a strong deactivation by formation of stable inactive Pd sulfates [1,3]. However, Arosio et al. [13] report a regeneration strategy based on periodical natural gas pulses fed to the catalyst limiting the effects of S-poisoning of palladium catalysts. Venezia et al. [14] report a high SO2 tolerant Pd supported on TiO2–SiO2 which presented a high methane oxidation activity. Different additives have been used to improve the palladium catalyst. One of the more promising additives is Pt, which considerably improves the stability during reaction [7,8,15]. A considerable number of papers have also shown that the activity of the Pd–Pt catalysts is improved in comparison to the monometallic palladium catalyst [7,16–18]: no deactivation under wet conditions and improved catalytic activity possibly attributed to Pt–Pd interactions. The improved catalytic activity might not be maintained after long term use of the catalyst due to metals segregation. The resistance of Pd–Pt bimetallic catalysts against poisoning by sulfur containing compounds has not been reported yet. Many studies of bimetallic catalysts for methane oxidation have been made using alumina as support material, and in most studies, catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the alumina with solutions of palladium and platinum nitrate. The catalysts were in all cases dried and only calcined at different temperatures [7–9,15,16,19,20], but no reducing step in hydrogen at high temperature was performed to obtain the final catalyst. In previous investigations on the oxidation of low concentration of methane in excess oxygen, we showed that pre-sulfating a Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst increased the oxidation activity and stability for this reaction relative to only reduced Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Pre-sulfation of the catalyst was performed by exposing the reduced catalyst for 4h at 500°C to a gas stream containing SO2 and O2 [21,22]. XPS data revealed the presence of metallic Pt(0) and the presence of Pt(IV) on this pre-sulfated Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It is well known that the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is catalyzed by Pt at temperatures greater than 200°C [23–25]. SO3 can react with the Al2O3 support to form Al2(SO4)3 and this reaction is further catalyzed by the presence of Pt [25]. Oxidation of SO2 occurs via its dissociate adsorption on Pt [25–27]. SO2 dissociate adsorption may be increased over Pt(0) related to Pt(IV) due to the higher electronic density in Pt(0), thus, to the higher interactions of Pt binding electrons with the anti-bonding orbital of the SO2 molecule. These facts suggest that if a reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst presents Pt(0) surface sites on which SO2 would be preferentially adsorbed, then the probability of SO2 adsorption on Pd surface sites may be lowered, since it is well known that the SO2 intrinsic activity of Pd is lower than that of Pt [28]. Therefore, Pd surface sites activity for methane oxidation would be protected from deactivation due to sulfates formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst on methane oxidation in a SO2 containing feed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The support used was γ-Al2O3 Merck with a grain size of 0.063–0.200mm (70–230mesh ASTM), with a surface area of 165.52m2/g, and a pore volume of 0.60cm3/g. Pt, Pd and Pt–Pd catalysts supported on alumina were prepared by impregnation using aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Aldrich, min. 99% purity). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 120°C overnight, and then calcined in flowing air for 6h at 500°C (called calcined catalysts). A sample of the calcined catalysts was reduced in pure hydrogen flow for 8h at 500°C (called reduced catalysts). A reference alumina support was prepared in the same way. A sample of the calcined or reduced catalysts was then sulfated. Sulfation was performed on the samples heating to 500°C in flowing air (100cm3 min−1), in order to eliminate any water traces in the support and prevent interactions between this water and SO2 over the catalyst during the sulfation process. The feed was then changed at 500°C for a nitrogen flow containing 50ppm SO2, 5% O2 (100cm3 min−1) for 4h. The sample (called calcined-sulfated catalyst or reduced-sulfated catalyst) was then cooled to 25°C. The chemical microanalysis of the catalyst was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (NORAN) performed in conjunction with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, model JSM-6300). Catalysts metal contents are reported in Table 1 . 2.2 Metal accessibility measurements Platinum and palladium accessibility measurements on the reduced catalyst, were obtained by the irreversible H2 chemisorption at room temperature in a static volumetric apparatus and using the stoichiometric (H/Pt–Pd)surf =1. Isotherms were obtained in the 0–50Torr (1Torr=1.33mbar) range. Extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm to zero pressure gave the monolayer coverage. This amount of H2 chemisorbed in monolayer was then used to calculate the Pt+Pd dispersion. 2.3 XPS characterization Photoelectron spectra were recorded over 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, and 2%Pt-1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 using a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical analyzer, operating in a constant pass energy mode, and a monochromatic MgKα (hν =1253.6eV, 1eV=1.603×10−19 J) X-ray source operated at 10mA and 12kV. The energy regions of the photoelectrons of interest were scanned a number of times in order to get good signal-to-noise ratios, as due to the relative high surface area and the small particle size the photoelectron intensity was very low. The intensities of the peaks were estimated by determining the integral of each peak after subtracting an S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak to Lorentzian/Gaussian lines (80%L/20%G). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the Al2p peak, the BE of which was fixed at 74.5eV. Using this reference, BE values of C1s peak coming from adventitious carbon appeared at 284.9±0.2eV. 2.4 Catalytic tests The catalyst tests were performed in a continuous flow tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 10mm) placed in a programmable furnace. The catalyst temperature was controlled by a thermocouple mounted internally. Reactant gases were fed from independent mass flow controllers. Measurements over the samples were performed using a feed volume flow rate of 100cm3 min−1 consisting of 2000ppmV CH4, 10vol.% of O2, and balance He. The catalyst loading in the reactor was of 200mg. The catalyst was not diluted with any inert component. The reactor out flow was analyzed using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph provided with a thermo-conductivity detector (TCD). Before measuring the catalytic activity, the samples were pretreated for 1h in the reactant stream at 600°C. The samples were then cooled down (always in the reactant stream) to 25°C and measurements used to determine the evolutions of CH4 conversion as a function of temperature were made as the sample was heated in the range 25–600°C at 10°Cmin−1. The samples were then cooled down again to 25°C. The process comprising the methane oxidation from 25 to 600°C is called a cycle. The catalyst was left at each temperature until the steady state was reached; usually 15min was more than sufficient, but in the region of the 50% methane conversion, more than 1h was required as a result of the exotherm generated. For the catalysts long time resistance test, ten similar cycles were performed over the same catalyst sample. Temperature-programmed reaction profiles allowed us to determine the temperature at which methane conversion attains 50% (T 50) and 100% (T 100). 3 Results 3.1 Catalysts characterization The reduced catalyst characterization data are summarized in Table 1. The H2 chemisorption method cannot be applied to determine metal dispersions over calcined catalysts. H2 isothermes are obtained over a clean surface after a reducing pretreatment in pure H2. This pretreatment leads to reduced surface metallic species. Metal dispersion values for the catalysts after sulfation were not determined because the samples needed to be reduced again under a H2 atmosphere at high temperature to reduce the metallic surface species. This reduction might have led to the reduction of sulfate to H2S which poisons Pt sites. 3.2 Methane oxidation In Table 2 , the T 50 and T 100 for methane on CH4–O2 reaction over 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 and 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are summarized. The γ-Al2O3 reference samples, prepared in the same way as the catalysts, were not active for methane oxidation at the temperature range studied in this work (25–600°C). 3.2.1 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 In Fig. 1 , we compare the evolution of CH4 during CH4–O2 reaction as a function of temperature over 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3. In this figure and in Table 2, the following facts can be observed: • A slight difference in T 50 for methane was observed over calcined and reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (479°C and 462°C, respectively). • Sulfating the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 resulted in an increase of the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction, reflected by the decrease of the T 50 for methane (462°C for reduced catalyst and 420°C for reduced-sulfated catalyst). • When the calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was sulfated, a strong decrease in activity for CH4–O2 reaction relative to only calcined catalyst was observed. The T 50 for methane determined over calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and calcined-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 were 479°C and 520°C, respectively. 3.2.2 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 Fig. 2 shows the evolution of CH4 over 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts as a function of the catalyst temperature. In this figure and in Table 2, it can be observed that: • Similar activities for calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 and reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 were found for CH4–O2 reaction (as in the case of 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3). Similar values of T 50 for methane were observed over calcined and reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (373°C or 360°C, respectively). • Sulfating the reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 or the calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a deactivation of CH4–O2 reaction. Table 2 shows higher T 50 for methane over sulfated samples related to only calcined or only reduced samples. It is evident that new inactive Pd sites were formed during sulfation. 3.2.3 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 The results from the CH4 evolution as a function of the temperature measurements for CH4–O2 reaction over bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are represented in Fig. 3 . This figure and Table 2 show the following facts: • Similar values of T 50 for methane were observed over calcined 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 and reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (380°C and 373°C, respectively). In Table 2, it can be seen, that the activity of these calcined or reduced bimetallic catalysts is similar to the activity of monometallic calcined or reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 for CH4–O2 reaction. • Sulfating the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst resulted in a very small decrease of the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction: T 50 for methane values were observed at 373°C for the reduced catalyst and at 387°C for the reduced-sulfated catalyst. • The effect of catalyst sulfation on CH4–O2 reaction over calcined 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 resulted in a strong increase of the T 50 for methane (380°C for the calcined catalyst and 435°C for calcined-sulfated catalyst). It is worth noting in Table 2, that the activity of calcined-sulfated bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 is very similar to the activity of calcined-sulfated monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. 3.2.4 Effect of SO2 in the CH4–O2 reaction feed In order to simulate a long term exposure of the catalysts to sulfur containing compounds present in natural gas, the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, and calcined 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 were exposed to a reaction mixture containing SO2. Ten temperature-programmed reaction cycles were performed over the catalysts. After the 10 reaction cycles, the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 was heated at 500°C in a nitrogen flow containing 500ppm SO2 and 5% O2 (100cm3 min−1) for 50h. After this catalyst ageing treatment, five additional CH4–O2 reaction cycles in the presence of 50ppmV SO2 were performed over the sample. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the presence of 50ppmV SO2 in the CH4–O2 reaction feed on the T 50 for methane over these catalysts, and the effect of ageing treatment on reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. 3.3 X-photoelectron spectroscopy Binding energies of core electrons and atomic surface ratios determined by XPS are reported in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. 3.3.1 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 XPS spectra for Pt4d5/2 on 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 are displayed in Fig. 5 . Binding energies of core electrons of calcined, reduced, and sulfated Pt catalysts are reported in Table 3. In this table, the following facts can be seen: • For the calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample, the binding energy of the Pt4d5/2, revealed only a binding energy component (317.2eV) that shows that Pt is only present as Pt (II) [29–33]. • For the calcined-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample, the binding energy of the Pt4d5/2, revealed a component at 317.2eV and a higher binding energy component (318.4eV) that can be associated to an increase in the highly oxidized Pt component with respect to the Pt (II) component. • The binding energy Pt4d5/2 for the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample indicates that Pt is present as Pt (0) (315.4eV). A second Pt component is observed at higher binding energies (318.0eV) corresponding to an oxidized species of Pt. Now, it has been reported [30,31], for PtO2 a binding energy component (318eV) of the Pt4d5/2 that can be assigned to Pt (IV). • For the reduced-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample, the binding energies of the Pt4d5/2, revealed that Pt is present as Pt (0) (315.4eV). The higher binding energy component (318.5eV) can be associated to an increase in the highly oxidized Pt component with respect to the Pt (0) component. 3.3.2 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra for Pd3d5/2 on 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. In Table 3, it can be observed the binding energies of core electrons of calcined, reduced, and sulfated Pd catalysts. • For the calcined sample, the binding energy Pd3d5/2 showed a value of 337.0eV. This value is too high for pure PdO, which presents a value of 336.7eV [34,35] indicating the possibility of a mixture with Pd (IV) that presents a signal at 337.5 [36,37]. • For the calcined-sulfated sample, the binding energy of the Pd3d5/2, revealed a signal at 337.5eV with a S/Pd surface atomic ratio of 0.23 (shown in Table 4), which can be associated to the formation of a surface SO4 2−. The effect of sulfating the calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, resulted in an increase in the degree of Pd oxidation, as evidenced by the increase in the Pd3d5/2 electron binding energy (from 337eV to 337.5eV), which can be associated to an oxidized Pd, probably in a SO x –PdO species, as it was proposed earlier [3,39]. Now, Mowery and McCormick [45] report for a reference PdSO4 a Pd 3d5/2 binding energy at 338.5eV. This binding energy is attributed to palladium sulfate, with a S/Pd atomic ratio of 1. However, for PdO exposed to SO2 and CH4 in air at 793K, these authors report a Pd3d5/2 binding energy at 336.9eV with a S/Pd atomic ratio of 0.22. This value is higher than expected for Pd2+ in PdO but lower than the PdSO4 reference. The same shift in the Pd binding energy is reported by Lampert et al. [3]. These authors report a Pd3d5/2 binding energy at 337.5eV with a S/Pd ratio of 0.23 after sulfation of a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. These results suggest that the differences in the Pd 3d5/2 binding energy values for the sulfated palladium samples depend on the S/Pd atomic ratio. • The binding energy Pd3d5/2 for the reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 sample indicates that Pd is present as Pd (II) (336.3eV). • The reduced-sulfated 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 sample showed a signal at 337.5eV, indicating as in the calcined-sulfated 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 sample, the presence of SO x –PdO species [3,39]. 3.3.3 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 XPS spectra for Pt4d5/2 and Pd3d5/2 on 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 7 . Binding energies of core electrons of the 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are reported in Table 3. These values indicate the following facts: • The Pt4d5/2 electron binding energies, observed in the bimetallic catalyst, independent of the pretreatment process, indicated no significant changes related to the Pt4d5/2 electron binding energies in the monometallic 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3. • No changes were observed for the binding energies of the Pd3d5/2, determined over 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 and over 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 for calcined, calcined-sulfated, and reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. • However, the Pd3d5/2 electron binding energy observed in the reduced-sulfated 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, revealed a signal at 337.0eV which is lower than the Pd3d5/2 electron binding energy observed in the reduced-sulfated monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 (337.5eV). This result suggests that the amount of SO x –PdO species generated during sulfation is lower. For the sulfated samples, the binding energy of the S2p3/2 (168.9eV) revealed that S is only present as S (VI) [29,38], thus only sulfate species are present in the catalyst. 4 Discussion In this work, we investigated the possibility of obtaining a Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst which could lower palladium deactivation due to the presence of sulfur compounds in the reaction feed during methane oxidation. 4.1 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 In Fig. 1, it can be observed that the evolutions of CH4 during CH4–O2 reaction as a function of temperature over calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 are very similar. However, XPS analysis revealed the presence of Pt (II) in the calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample and the presence of Pt (0) and Pt (IV) in the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample. The different Pt electronic states present in each catalyst should result in different catalytic behavior for CH4–O2 reaction, but this is not the case. These results can be explained assuming that under oxygen excess conditions, all Pt surface sites on both catalysts are highly covered by adsorbed oxygen as proposed in previous investigations [39–41]. Sulfating the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 resulted in an increase of the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction. From these results, as reported in our previous investigations [21,22], it would appear that the activity of the catalytic sites for CH4 oxidation are strongly promoted by the presence of the new sites composed by Pt (IV) and the SO4 2− generated during the sulfation process at the metal support interface over the catalyst. This assumption is supported by the XPS analysis (Table 3) that revealed a binding energy component of the Pt4d5/2 at 318.5eV which may correspond to the platinum species interacting with the SO4 2− species at the metal support interface. It is worth noting in Table 4 that sulfating the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 resulted in a decrease in the Pt/Al atomic surface ratio (0.0040 for reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 0.0028 for reduced-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3), thus in a decrease in the Pt surface area, thus in an increase in the metallic particle. The decreased Pt surface area should have resulted in a decrease in the Pt activity for the CH4–O2 reaction. However, this is not the case. These results can be explained assuming that the promoting effect of the new sites generated during sulfation of the reduced 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 may largely compensate the loss in active surface area. On the other hand, the binding energy component at 315.4 observed in reduced-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 revealed the presence of Pt (0). This result indicates that the high temperature reduction of the catalyst generated Pt species that remained at their metallic state despite the sulfation pretreatment. Fig. 1 also shows that sulfating the calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst resulted in a strong decrease in activity for CH4–O2 reaction. This result can be explained considering that the size of the Pt particles increased upon exposure to a sulfur mixture at high temperature, as demonstrated previously by Chang et al. [42] and Lee et al. [43]. The increase in Pt particles may have resulted in a decrease in Pt surface atoms. This explanation is supported by the atomic surface ratios determined by XPS and shown in Table 4. In this table it can be seen that sulfating the calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 resulted in a decrease in the Pt/Al atomic surface ratio (0.0038 for calcined 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 0.0020 for calcined-sulfated 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3). Now, previous reports agree in that methane oxidation on Pt-based catalysts is promoted on larger Pt cristallites [44,39]. However, the loss of active sites by Pt sintering during sulfation process is higher than the promotion of methane oxidation on larger Pt cristallites. Thus, with increasing Pt particle size, there is a consequent loss in active surface area, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction, as demonstrated by Garetto and Apesteguia [41]. 4.2 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 XPS analysis revealed the presence of only Pd (II) over the reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 and a mixture of Pd (II) and Pd (IV) over the calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. However, Fig. 2 shows that calcined and reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts present similar activities for CH4–O2 reaction. The similarity of activities for both catalysts can be explained, assuming that during CH4–O2 reaction over the reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, Pd (IV) species may have been generated due to the presence of excess oxygen. Thus, during reaction, the active surface of reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 may be similar to the calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 active surface [3]. The deactivation of palladium catalysts due to sulfation is a very well known phenomenon [1,3,45–50] often referred to the formation of palladium sulfate species which are not active for the CH4–O2 reaction. Fig. 2 shows that sulfating the reduced 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 or the calcined 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a strong deactivation for CH4–O2 reaction. It is evident that new inactive Pd sites were formed during sulfation. These sites may be probably SO x –PdO species evidenced by XPS analysis which revealed a signal at 337.5eV corresponding to these species on both sulfated catalysts. 4.3 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3, show that the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction of the calcined, calcined-sulfated, and reduced bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 is similar to the activity of the calcined, calcined-sulfated, and reduced monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, respectively. It would appear that the activity of the bimetallic catalyst is due only to the Pd active sites over the catalyst. Moreover, the results seem to show that Pt species do not interact with Pd species at the surface of the catalyst. XPS results support this observation: Pt4d5/2 electron binding energies in the monometallic 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and Pd3d5/2 electron binding energies in the monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are very similar to those determined for the bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Moreover, Table 4 shows values for the atomic surface ratios for monometallic 2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 very similar to those determined for the bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3. A very interesting result is observed in Table 2 and in Fig. 3 which show that sulfating the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst resulted in only a very slight decrease of the catalytic activity for CH4–O2 reaction. It seems that the reduction of the catalyst at high temperature may have generated active Pt surface species able to prevent the deactivation of Pd surface species by sulfur deactivation. This assumption is supported by the XPS determinations on reduced-sulfated 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, shown in Table 3. In this table it can be seen the following facts: • The Pt4d5/2, electron binding energies observed in the reduced-sulfated 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 revealed a signal at 315.4eV corresponding to metallic Pt(0) species. Now, it has been shown that the oxidation of SO2 occurs via its dissociate adsorption on Pt [25–27], thus SO2 dissociate adsorption may be increased over Pt(0) related to Pt(IV) due to the higher electronic density in Pt(0), thus, to the higher interactions of Pt binding electrons with the anti-bonding orbital of the SO2 molecule. It is worth noting that metallic Pt(0) is present only in the reduced catalysts. • The Pd3d5/2 electron binding energy observed in the reduced-sulfated 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, at 337.0eV which is lower than the Pd3d5/2 electron binding energy observed in the reduced-sulfated monometallic 1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 (337.5eV). This result suggests that the amount of SO x –PdO species generated during sulfation is lower. The results presented above suggest that the reduction of a bimetallic Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in H2 at high temperature may be necessary to generate Pt(0) sites which are active at adsorbing and oxidizing SO2 present in the reaction flow in the CH4–O2 reaction. Based on the fact that the SO2 intrinsic activity of Pd is lower than that of Pt [28], we assume that the presence of Pt(0) may lower the probability of SO2 interactions with surface palladium species, thus may lower its deactivation at methane oxidation reaction. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the presence of SO2 on the evolution of T 50 for methane as a function of the number of the temperature-programmed CH4–O2 reaction cycles. This figure shows that over calcined 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of SO2 in the reaction flow resulted in a strong increase of T 50 for methane from the first CH4–O2 reaction cycle. This deactivation increased with the number of cycles and may be due to the formation of SO x –PdO species generated by SO2 interactions with palladium surface sites. However, over the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3, the T 50 for methane remains rather unaffected with the increase of CH4–O2 reaction cycles, despite the presence of SO2 in the reaction flow. This results shows that the probability of SO2 interaction with surface species on the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 may be higher on Pt(0) related to Pd species. In order to study the long term effects of SO2 deactivation in CH4 oxidation, we treated the reduced 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 (after 10 reaction cycles) in the ageing conditions described above. After this catalyst ageing treatment, five additional CH4–O2 reaction cycles in the presence of 50ppmV SO2 were performed over the sample. Fig. 4 shows a slight deactivation of the catalyst for methane oxidation after the ageing treatment. However, after two reaction cycles, the catalyst activity was completely recovered, e.g.: T 50 for methane during the second reaction cycle after ageing treatment was 390°C. 5 Conclusions In this work, we investigated the possibility of obtaining a Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst which could lower palladium deactivation due to the presence of SO2 in the reaction feed during methane oxidation. Results showed that the reduced bimetallic 2%Pt–1%Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts presented a high resistance to deactivation by sulfur poisoning. The results are explained on basis of the XPS determinations revealing the presence of Pt metallic surface sites over the bimetallic catalyst. These metallic Pt sites may lower the probability of SO2 interactions with surface palladium species, thus may lower its deactivation for methane oxidation reaction.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied over calcined and reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in the presence and the absence of SO2 in the CH4–O2 reaction feed. The effect of sulfation (SO2 +O2 for 4h at 500°C) was also studied on the catalyst resistance to deactivation by sulfur poisoning. Sulfating the calcined Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a strong deactivation for the CH4–O2 reaction. However, the catalytic activity of the reduced-sulfated Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for CH4–O2 reaction remained rather unaffected in the presence and in the absence of SO2 in the reaction feed. XPS analysis revealed, over reduced-sulfated Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the presence of Pt(0) metallic surface species on which SO2 interactions may be faster related to Pd surface species. The presence of Pt(0) may be necessary to prevent the interactions between SO2 and Pd surface species. Long time catalytic tests showed that the activity of a reduced Pt–Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for CH4–O2 reactions remained rather unaffected despite the presence of SO2 in the reaction feed.",
