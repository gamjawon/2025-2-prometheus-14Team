E. UFLYAND State Pedagogical Institute, Engelsa 33, Rostov-on-Don 344082 (U.S.S.R.) and A. D. POMOGAILO Institute of Chemical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region 142432 (U.S.S.R.) Summary A comparative analysis of homogeneous and immobilized catalysts for ethylene dimerization based on nickel(II) chelates has been carried out. Metal chelation enables an increase in catalyst activity and extends the temperature range over which they function. The fixation of metal ions on polymeric carriers with chelating groups leads to an additional increase in the specific catalytic activity of the complexes. In homogeneous systems, the activity of nickel chelates in the dimerization reaction decreases in the order: enaminoketonates enaminoiminates > diketonates > diacylaminates, whereas for immobilized catalysts the influence of the mode of coordination is negligible. For both types of catalyst an increase in the number of metal ions in the complex molecule or monomer unit leads to a decrease in the specific activity of the complexes provided that the polynuclear structure of the complex does not disintegrate. Introduction Of all the metal complex catalysts used for ethylene dimerization, those of the 'nickel' systems, consisting of nickel compounds and dialkylaluminium chlorides, have been studied in the greatest detail [1-3]. These investigations have shown that the dimerization reaction is extremely susceptible to all those factors which influence the geometry of the active centers and espe- cially to the nature of those ligands which do not take part directly in the reaction [4]. Chelate-forming ligands exert the strongest influence since they create a rigid matrix which limits the extent of coordination and, therefore, the introduction of substrate molecule [5]. The introduction of such stability coupled with solubility considerations provided for such extensive attention to the study of the catalytic properties of different nickel chelates in the dimerization of ethylene. Basically, information about the activity of these 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 303 chelates is limited to the patent literature, and the experimental conditions reported in such sources have often been idiosyncratic. Nevertheless, the analysis of the catalytic activity as a function of the ligand nature is of obvious interest for the development of directional catalysts. The fixation of nickel ions on carrier supports via functional groups is one way in which the efficiency of nickel catalysts may be increased [6, 7]. The polymeric carrier prevents migration of nickel complexes along the surface, stabilizes the active centres and hampers the formation of large ferromagnetic particles [8]. It has been shown [9] that the catalytic activity of such complexes may be correlated with the dimensions of the clusters formed during the course of the reaction. It was shown previously [7] that a higher activity may be attained with immobilized catalysts if the nickel ions are attached by means of chelate formation. The present paper provides a comparative analysis of homogeneous and immobilized catalysts for ethylene dimerization based on nickel(II) chelates, the different nature of the metallocycle and of the mode of coordination having been studied in particular. Experimental Nickel chelates (I) - (VII) and (IX) (see Schemes 1 to 4) were prepared according to previously described procedures [10-12,18,20-23]. A polyethylene powder with a specific surface area of 4 m2 g~1, a pore radius of 1000 nm and a pore volume of 1.17 cm3 g~1 was used as the polymeric carrier. The chelating ligands were prepared by the gas phase and suspension grafting polymerization of vinyl monomers (methyl vinyl ketone, acryloni- trile and acrylamide) to the polyethylene surface, followed by transformation of the grafting groups into chelating fragments according to previously described procedures [7, 24]. The immobilized chelates were synthesized by the interaction of nickel acetate with the polymeric carrier containing such chelating fragments [7, 25]. Ethylene dimerization was carried out in n-heptane solution with con- stant stirring in a high-pressure system at constant temperature. The compo- sition of ethylene dimerization products was determined by Chromatographie methods. Results Ethylene dimerization in the presence of homogeneous catalysts The kinetic dependencies for ethylene dimerization in the presence of catalytic systems based on nickel chelates (I) - (IV) (Scheme 1) are presented in Fig. 1. Analysis of these data leads to the conclusion that enaminoiminates (I) and enaminoketonates (II), exhibit the highest activity independent of the tetrahedral [(I), R^gHs] [10] or square-planar [(II), R^eHg] [11] 304 coordination modes involved, or of the trans [(II), R = CeH5] [11] or cis [(II), R=1/2(H2C CHg)] positions of the donor atoms [12]. Substitution of the nitrogen atom in the chelate mode of enaminoketonates [complex (II)] by an oxygen atom [complex (III)] leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity despite the similar square-planar structures of these metal complexes [11 -13]. A comparison of complexes (III) and (IV), which have the same coordination mode (N104), but different metallocycles, shows that the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the metallocycle leads to a subsequent decrease in the catalytic activity of the nickel chelate. / \\ ^, S 7==^ ^--x , /= ^ .^ ^ Ph-(. < y^ <\\ ^Mi^ ) XL-N- ^N=/ ^ M' 0-=< ^ / (i) ^R, Ph (II) \"'^^-f ^^ ^ ' < ^ ^ (III) (IV) Scheme 1. Structures of nickel enaminoiminates (I), enaminoketonates (II), diketonate (III) and diacylaminate (IV). Investigations of polymetallic compounds as models of dimetallic active centres is invoking growing interest at present [14]. Some authors [15-17] have suggested new possibilities for effecting the dimerization and oligomer- ization of unsaturated hydrocarbons by the use of bimetallic intermediates. A comparative analysis of the catalytic activity of the same type of mono- and poly-nuclear complexes can provide important information in this respect. Thus, under identical reaction conditions, a decrease in the specific catalytic activity in going from the monochelates [complexes (III) and (IV)] to the binuclear chelates (V) and (VI) (Scheme 2) is clearly observed (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a comparison of the behaviour of the binuclear complexes (V) and (VI) leads to the conclusion that the introduction of a nitrogen atom into a metallocycle also leads to a decrease in the activity of the complexes as observed in the case of mononuclear chelates. Study of the catalytic activity of a binuclear chelate complex involving a Schiff base obtained from salicylaldehyde and o-aminophenol [(VII), Scheme 3] provided some unexpected results. The activity of this complex is substantially greater than those of other binuclear systems and approaches that exhibited by mononuclear nickel chelates (Fig. 1). Apparently, mononu- clear complex formation occurs in this case through the action of an alumini- umalkyi during active centre formation. Such behaviour accords with the 305 'C.rf'n. r, mm Fig. 1.

It should be noted that the nature of the metallocycle and the coordina- tion mode, as well as the number of metal ions in the complex molecule, have little influence on the selectivity of catalytic complexes in the dimerization of ethylene to butenes (Table 1). This provides additional evidence that the same mechanism of interaction is involved with mono- and poly-nuclear complexes.

The strong coordination of the metal ion on the polymeric carrier in the chelate mode (in contrast to valent and coordination binding [7]) prevents its removal during the catalytic process and hence increases substantially the stability of the catalytic systems. Complexes (X) and (XI) exhibit comparable activity indicating the small effect of the nature of coordination mode on complex activity. A comparison of the activity of complexes (X) and (XIII), which have the same coordination mode but contain different metallocycles, indicates that the introduction of a nitrogen atom in the metallocycle leads to a substantial decrease in catalytic activity. Finally, an increase in the number of metal atoms in the monomer unit of the polymeric carrier is accompanied by a decrease in the specific catalytic activities of the complexes (Fig. 2). It should be noted that immobilized systems show the same selectivity towards butenes as homogeneous catalysts. In both cases, the butene yield is in the range 90 - 95% (Table 2). Discussion and conclusions Comparative analysis of homogeneous and immobilized catalysts for ethylene dimerization shows that the fixation of metal ions on a polyethylene surface by means of grafting chelating groups leads to a substantial increase in the stability of the complexes and of the product yield. In contrast to homogeneous systems, the formation of active centres in immobilized cata- lysts proceeds slowly, but deactivation processes are also slowed down with 309 TABLE 2 Ethylene dimerization on inunobilized catalysts* Nickel chelate Nickel content (mg at.g-1) Real rate (g N rtion [kg i)-1!!-1] Product composition (wt.%) Butenes Hexenes Methylpentenes Dimethylbutenes (X) (XI)(R = CgH,,) (XII) (XIII) (XIV) (XV) 0.447 0.141 0.080 0.224 0.120 0.977 27.5 25.0 31.0 15.5 30.0 12.2 92.3 91.3 90.9 90.8 91.7 91.1 1.5 3.5 3.0 4.2 1.6 3.0 3.7 3.0 2.9 1.5 3.9 2.2 2.6 2.2 3.2 3.5 2.8 3.7 'Reaction conditions: n-heptane; PC,H, = 0.4 MPa; 363 K; Ai/Ni =30; cocatalyst, AlC^CL;. the result that an increase in the specific catalytic activity of the complexes is observed. It has been shown previously [7] that, in homogeneous systems, 30% of the nickel ions in the complexes are transformed to metallic nickel within 30 min. However, for supported catalysts, the formation of metallic nickel under identical conditions is only a part of 1%. Thus, the polymeric carrier prevents the aggregation of nickel(O) complexes and hence limits catalyst deactivation. The fixation of nickel chelates on polymer carriers extends the temper- ature range over which they are active to 363 K (Table 2). Since the product composition obtained on ethylene dimerization in the presence of homoge- neous (Table 1) and immobilized (Table 2) systems is the same, this leads to the conclusion that the same mechanism must be involved with both systems and that the active centres must be similar as well. For homogeneous systems, the activity of the nickel chelates in ethylene dimerization decreases in the order: enaminoketonates ena- minoiminates > diketonates > diacylaminates, whereas for immobilized sys- tems the effect of the coordination mode is negligible. For both types of catalysts, an increase in the number of metal atoms in the complex molecule or in the monomer unit leads to a decrease in the specific activity of the complex, provided that no breakdown occurs in the polynuclear structure. Apparently, in the case of some polymetallic complexes the rigidity of nickel ions in the polydentate matrix creates difficulties as far as metal reduction and active centre formation are concerned.

        "dc:description": "A comparative analysis of homogeneous and immobilized catalysts for ethylene dimerization based on nickel(II) chelates has been carried out. Metal chelation enables an increase in catalyst activity and extends the temperature range over which they function. The fixation of metal ions on polymeric carriers with chelating groups leads to an additional increase in the specific catalytic activity of the complexes. In homogeneous systems, the activity of nickel chelates in the dimerization reaction decreases in the order: enaminoketonates ≈ enaminoiminates > diketonates > diacylaminates, whereas for immobilized catalysts the influence of the mode of coordination is negligible. For both types of catalyst an increase in the number of metal ions in the complex molecule or monomer unit leads to a decrease in the specific activity of the complexes provided that the polynuclear structure of the complex does not disintegrate.",
