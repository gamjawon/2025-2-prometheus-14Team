DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60119-9 Hydrocracking of Tar Components from Hot Coke Oven Gas over a Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / � -Al 2 O 3 Catalyst at Atmospheric Pressure YU Fei 1 , YUE Baohua 2 , WANG Xueguang 1,* , GENG Shuhua 1 , LU Xionggang 1 , DING Weizhong 1,# 1 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Modern Metallurgy and Material Processing, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200072, China 2 Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China Abstract: Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different Ce-ZrO 2 contents and Ni loadings were prepared by a two step impregnation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N 2 adsorption, and temperature-programmed reduction. The catalysts were used for the hydrocracking of toluene and naphthalene, which were model tar compounds in hot coke oven gas, under at- mospheric pressure at 800 o C. They showed excellent catalytic activity, stability, and some sulfur tolerance. Both toluene and naphthalene was converted into light fuel gases even at a low mole ratio of steam to carbon (S/C = 0.44). During the testing period of 7 h, no coke de- position was observed on the surface of the catalysts. The results indicated that the addition of Ce-ZrO 2 limited the sintering of Ni particles and enhanced the catalytic activity. The Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst is promising for the direct removal of tar compounds in hot coke oven gas with low S/C ratios. Key words: nickel; cerium-zirconium oxide; catalytic cracking; tar; toluene; naphthalene Hydrogen is considered a most promising energy carrier due to its highly efficient, safe, and non-polluting characteris- tics. Coke oven gas (COG), a byproduct from coke making, consists of ca. 55% H 2 and 25% CH 4 (volume fraction). It can be used as a potential source for low cost hydrogen production. However, hot COG emitted from coke ovens at a high tem- perature between 800 and 850 °C has to be cooled with an ammonia aqueous solution spray to remove most of the higher hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and naphthalene, etc., called tar. This process causes not only substantial loss of heat but also some tar loss in the water, which leads to serious secondary pollution. From energy economy and environmental considerations, the development of an effective catalyst for the direct cracking or steam reforming of tar into light fuel gases using the sensible heat and chemical energy in hot COG is of great significance [1–5]. However, hot COG contains only 10%–15% steam (volume fraction) and the mole ratio of steam to carbon (S/C < 1.0) is very low. Conventional catalysts for tar conversion will be deactivated immediately due to carbon deposition at high temperature, leading to bed clogging. Therefore, the catalytic conversion of tar components in hot COG with low S/C ratios is a challenging task. Ni/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts have been widely investigated because of their high mechanical strength, easy preparation, and low cost. They showed good catalytic activity for the hydrocrack- ing of heavy hydrocarbons and catalytic cracking of biomass tar. However, the rapid deactivation of Ni/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts due to sintering or loss of active Ni component and easy car- bon deposition at high temperature [6,7] has been reported. In addition, Ni catalysts are easily poisoned and deactivated by sulfur [8]. Generally, the addition of some metal oxide pro- moter is considered an attractive alternative to improve the reaction performance and stability of catalysts. It has been reported that ceria-zirconia oxides can improve the surface properties of catalysts and enhance the reaction performance and their resistance to carbon deposition in the catalytic re- forming of methane, ethanol, etc. [9–14]. The purpose of this work is to prepare Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 YU Fei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 690–696 catalysts with high stability for the hydrocracking of toluene (C 7 H 8 ) and naphthalene (C 10 H 8 ), which are model tar com- pounds, at high temperature and atmosphere pressure. The Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts showed excellent catalytic ac- tivity, stability, and some sulfur tolerance. This research is of importance in guiding the development of cracking catalysts for the tar components from hot COG with low S/C ratios. 1 EExperimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by a two step impregnation method. -Al 2 O 3 particles (20–40 mesh, Wen- zhou Alumina Plant, China) were added under stirring into an appropriate amount of aqueous solution of cerium nitrate and zirconium nitrate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) with a Ce/Zr mole ratio of 1:3. This was kept at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was dried at 80 o C. After this, the solids were dried at 100 o C overnight and finally were calcined at 650 qC for 2 h. NiO was loaded on the Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 supports using an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) by a similar prepa- ration method. The obtained samples were calcined at 800 qC for 4 h at a heating rate of 1 qC/min. The catalysts were noted as yNi/xCe-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 , where x represented the mass per- centage of Ce-ZrO 2 , and y was the mass percentage of Ni. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2550 apparatus using Cu K D radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA in the 2 scanning range of 20 q–80 q. The average diameter D of the Ni particles on the reduced catalysts was estimated using the Scherrer formula D = K / cos [15], where is the X-ray wavelength (0.15408 nm), is the full-width at half-maximum, is the diffraction angle of the Ni(111) dif- fraction peak, and K is a constant (0.9). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were obtained by N 2 adsorption at –196 o C using a Micromer- itics ASAP 2020 Sorptometer. The samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 qC for 5 h. The sizes and dispersion of the Ni particles on the Ni/ Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-200CX appa- ratus. The sample was ground and dispersed in ethanol, then dropped onto a copper net, and dried at 60 qC. Temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was carried out on a homemade equipment to observe the reducibility of the catalysts. Prior to the H 2 -TPR measurement, 0.1 g catalyst was first pretreated in a flow of Ar at 300 qC for 0.5 h and then cooled to room temperature. The reduction reaction was con- ducted in a 10% H 2 /Ar (V/V) mixture at 30 ml/min. The tem- perature was raised to 1200 o C at a heating rate of 10 qC/min. The amount of H 2 uptake was measured with a thermal con- ductivity detector (TCD). 1.3 Catalytic tests and analysis The catalytic tests were carried out on an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor. A preheater filled with quartz balls with a set temperature of 350 o C was used to vaporize the liquids and fully mix the reaction gases. A catalyst of 1 g was placed at the middle portion of the quartz tube reactor with an internal di- ameter of 10 mm and a length of 1000 mm. The catalyst was first reduced at 800 qC in a gas mixture of 10% H 2 /N 2 (V/V) for 2 h. Then a mixture of 85% toluene and 15% naphthalene (mass fraction), H 2 O, and H 2 was introduced at a mass space velocity of 6000 ml/(g·h). The reaction temperature was kept at 800 o C. To avoid condensation of the reactants, the pipe line was kept at 200 °C. After 2 h reaction, the reaction system became stable and the products were sampled at appropriate reaction intervals with a six-way valve and analyzed using an online GC-9800 gas chromatograph (Shanghai Branch Chong Chromatography Instruments Ltd., China) with a flame ioni- zation detector for benzene (C 6 H 6 ), toluene, and naphthalene, followed by another GC-9800 gas chromatograph with a TCD for light fuel gases in the cooled, purified gas mixture. The flow rate of outlet gas was measured by a soap flow meter. The mass balance was 98% ± 3% on the basis of carbon in the product gases. The toluene and naphthalene conversions (X) and the yields (Y) of the products were calculated as follows: X(C 7 H 8 ) = (n(C 7 H 8 ,in) – n(C 7 H 8 ,out))/n(C 7 H 8 ,in) X(C 10 H 8 ) = (n(C 10 H 8 ,in) – n(C 10 H 8 ,out))/n(C 10 H 8 ,in) Y(CH 4 ) = n(CH 4 ,out)/(7n(C 7 H 8 ,in) + 10n(C 10 H 8 ,in)) Y(CO) = n(CO,out)/(7n(C 7 H 8 ,in) + 10n(C 10 H 8 ,in)) Y(C 6 H 6 ) = 6n(C 6 H 6 ,out)/(7n(C 7 H 8 ,in) + 10n(C 10 H 8 ,in)) where n(i,in) and n(i,out) were the molar amount of the inlet and outlet gas i, respectively (i was C 7 H 8 , C 10 H 8 , CH 4 , CO, and C 6 H 6 , respectively). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 BET surface area of the catalysts Table 1 shows the BET surface areas of the supports and yNi/xCe-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different loadings. It can be seen that the BET surface areas of the Ce-ZrO 2 -modified or Ni-loaded catalysts were in the range of 90.9–122.5 m 2 /g, which was smaller than that of pure -Al 2 O 3 (158.9 m 2 /g). This may be due to the blocking of part of the micropores in -Al 2 O 3 and the formation of NiAl 2 O 4 through the reaction between NiO and Al 2 O 3 on the surface of the catalysts [16]. For cata- lysts with the same Ni loading (9%), the surface areas de- YU Fei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 690–696 creased from 114.2 to 90.9 m 2 /g with increasing Ce-ZrO 2 con- tent to 20%. For catalysts with the same Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 content (20%), the BET surface areas of the catalysts decreased from 122.5 to 102.5 m 2 /g with increasing Ni loading from 0 to 15%. 2.2 XRD results Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the yNi/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different Ni loadings. The diffraction peak at 2 = 67.1 o gradually shifted lower to 2 = 65.8 o with increasing Ni loading, and the diffraction peak at 2 = 39.3 o disappeared gradually, indicating the formation of the spinel structure NiAl 2 O 4 between NiO and Al 2 O 3 in the calcination process (JCPDS, 10-0339). For all the yNi/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / - Al 2 O 3 catalysts, no characteristic peaks corresponding to the NiO phase was observed. This showed that there was no free NiO species on the catalysts. The patterns of Ce-ZrO 2 in the catalysts in Fig. 1 showed two groups of diffraction peaks. One group at 2 = 28.5 o , 47.6 o , and 56.4 o corresponded to the cubic crystal structure, and the other group at 2 = 30.1 o , 50.2 o , and 60.0 o corresponded to the tetragonal structure. These showed that a mixed structure of the cubic Ce-rich solid solution and the tetragonal Zr-rich solid solution was formed instead of a homogeneous Ce-ZrO 2 solid solution [17]. The intensities of the diffraction peaks of the Ce-ZrO 2 solid solutions were weaker and the peak shapes were relatively diffused, implying that the Ce-ZrO 2 solid solutions formed were highly dispersed on the surface of the catalysts. The XRD patterns of the 9%Ni/xCe-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different Ce-ZrO 2 contents reduced in a flow of 10%H 2 /N 2 at 800 qC for 2 h are given in Fig. 2. The new dif- fraction peaks at 2 = 44.5 o , 51.8 o , and 76.4 o corresponded to Ni(111), (200), and (220), respectively. These showed that Ni 2+ ions in the samples were reduced to metal Ni. The peak inten- sity of metal Ni decreased and the peak width increased with Ce-ZrO 2 content, showing the decrease in the Ni particle size. The average Ni particle size on the reduced 9%Ni/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, estimated from the half-peak width of the Ni(111) plane, was 14.1 nm. The Ni particle size gradually decreased to 6.5 nm with increasing Ce-ZrO 2 content up to 20%. This indi- cates that smaller Ni nanoparticles were formed on the Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts by H 2 reduction, and that the addition of Ce-ZrO 2 can effectively prevent the sintering of Ni particles. This may be attributed to the effects of separation and surface coating by the Ce-ZrO 2 solid solution dispersed on the surface of the catalysts. 2.3 H 2 -TPR measurements The H 2 -TPR results of the 9%Ni/xCe-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with different Ce-ZrO 2 contents are shown in Fig. 3.

YU Fei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 690–696 duction peaks of Ni 2+ ions were observed in the lower tem- perature (< 800 o C) region, implying that there was neither free NiO species nor complex NiO x species with a strong interac- tion with the support [10] in accordance with the XRD results. In the higher temperature region, there was a strong H 2 con- sumption peak, which was attributed to the reduction of Ni- Al 2 O 4 phase. The peak temperature increased from 950 to 975 o C with increasing Ce-ZrO 2 content. This may be due to the hindering effect of the surface coating of Ce-ZrO 2 on the sur- face of the catalysts on the reduction of NiAl 2 O 4 . The H 2 -TPR profiles of the yNi/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts with different Ni loadings are shown in Fig. 4. All the catalysts showed a H 2 consumption corresponding to the re- duction of NiAl 2 O 4 . The peak temperature gradually shifted to higher temperature with decreasing Ni loading. This may be due to that the NiAl 2 O 4 phase is difficult to sinter into larger particles at low Ni loadings. With these, upon calcination at an elevated temperature, the spinel-like NiAl 2 O 4 species will diffuse into the subsurface or bulk of the supports to form a kind of spinel-like solid solution due to the similarity of its structure to -Al 2 O 3 . This leads to the increase in the reduction temperature [18] . 2.4 TEM analysis The TEM images of the 9%Ni/ -Al 2 O 3 and 9%Ni/10%Ce- ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 800 qC in a flow of 10%H 2 /N 2 for 2 h are given in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Ni particles were uniformly dispersed on the catalyst surface. For the 9%Ni/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, Ni particles were in the range of 13–19 nm. For the catalyst with Ce-ZrO 2 loading, Ni particles were mainly between 5 and 9 nm. This further indicated that the addition of Ce-ZrO 2 oxide can effectively inhibit the sin- tering of Ni particles. The Ni particle sizes decreased with increasing Ce-ZrO 2 content in agreement with the XRD results. Fig. 5(c) shows the TEM image of the 9%Ni/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst after reaction at 800 o C for 7 h. The dispersion of Ni particles on the catalyst surface showed little change, and the Ni particle sizes have only a slight increase in the range 5–10 nm compared with those before reaction. This suggests that the Ni nanoparticles on the surface of the catalysts pos- sessed excellent stability. A small amount of carbon whisker was observed on the surface of the used catalyst as shown with other Ni-based reforming catalysts [19]. 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Temperature ( o C) In te n s ity 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% Fig. 3.

YU Fei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 690–696 2.5 Catalytic performance of the catalysts for the hydro- cracking of toluene and naphthalene 2.5.1 Effect of reaction time Figure 6 shows the effect of the reaction time on the catalytic conversion of toluene and naphthalene over the 9%Ni/10%Ce- ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst at S/C = 0.44. It can be seen that toluene and naphthalene were transformed to CO and CH 4 , and their conversions are both maintained at 100% during the reaction period of 7 h. The yield of CO was 43%–46%, which is stoi- chiometric with the amount of water in the feed gas. The yield of CH 4 was about 55%–60%. During the reaction, no other hydrocarbons or small molecule carbonaceous gases were detected. This implies that almost all of the toluene and naph- thalene can be reformed with H 2 O to CO or be selectively hydrogenated to form CH 4 . 2.5.2 Effect of Ce-ZrO 2 content Figure 7 shows the catalytic performance of the 9%Ni/xCe- ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 after reaction for 7 h at S/C = 0.44. It can be seen that the addition of Ce-ZrO 2 remarkably enhanced the conver- sions of toluene and naphthalene, and the yield of CH 4 was also increased. However, when the Ce-ZrO 2 content was more than 15%, the conversions of toluene and naphthalene started to decline. This is because more smaller Ni particles were formed on the catalyst surfaces due to the addition of Ce-ZrO 2 , which resulted in an increase in the active sites, but the presence of an excess of Ce-ZrO 2 would have a hindering effect on the reactions on the active sites. When toluene and naphthalene were not completely converted, there was always a small amount of benzene in the product. This was from the high temperature homogeneous pyrolysis of toluene and naphthalene. 2.5.3 Effect of Ni loading Figure 8 shows the reaction results after reaction for 7 h over the yNi/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts. When Ni content was in the range of 0%–9%, the conversions of toluene and naph- thalene increased with Ni loading from ca. 27% and 35%, respectively, to 100%. When the Ni content was further in- creased, the conversions of toluene and naphthalene showed little change. As seen in Fig. 8, the CO yield increased with Ni content at lower Ni contents. When the Ni content was in- creased to 6%, the CO yield reached 54%, while the CH 4 yield showed little change at ca. 5%. With the further increase in Ni content, the CO yield kept unchanged because the H 2 O in the feed gas was exhausted, but the CH 4 yield dramatically in- creased to ca. 46%. This was in line with the trends of the 0 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 0 20 40 60 80 100 Conversion of C 6 H 8 Conversion of C 10 H 8 Yield of CO Yield of CH 4 C onver s ion or yi el d ( % ) Reaction time (min) Fig. 6.

YU Fei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 690–696 conversions of toluene and naphthalene. These indicated that toluene and naphthalene preferentially reacted with H 2 O to form CO and H 2 in this reaction system. 2.5.4 Effect of S/C ratio The effect of different S/C ratios on the reaction perform- ance for toluene and naphthalene is given in Fig. 9. The con- versions of toluene and naphthalene increased with increasing S/C ratio. When the S/C ratio was 0.44, the conversions of both toluene and naphthalene reached 100%. The yields of both CH 4 and CO increased with increasing S/C ratio when the S/C ratio was lower. This indicates that increased H 2 O content benefited the steam reforming of toluene and naphthalene and substan- tially promoted the formation of CH 4 as well. However, the CH 4 yield started to decline when the S/C value was further increased. The CO yield still continued to increase, and its amount was stoichiometric with the water added. These further confirmed that toluene and naphthalene preferentially reacted with steam to form CO and H 2 . 2.5.5 Effect of H 2 S There is a high concentration of sulfur compounds in hot COG. The sulfur tolerance of the catalysts is an important factor in whether the newly developed catalysts can be applied for the catalytic conversion of tar in hot COG. The non-modified nickel-based catalysts were easily poisoned by sulfur. In order to study the effect of sulfur on the catalyst, 0.025% of H 2 S was introduced into the reaction mixture. Fig. 10 shows the effect of H 2 S on the conversions of toluene and naphthalene over the 9%Ni/10%Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalyst as a function of reaction time. It can be seen that both toluene and naphthalene can be completely converted within the reaction period of 5 h. With the increase of the reaction time, the cata- lytic activity began to decline, but the conversions of toluene and naphthalene still reached about 90% after 7 h. This indi- cates that the catalyst had some sulfur tolerance. 2.5.6 Reaction mechanism It can be seen from the reaction results that toluene and naphthalene can be completely converted to CO and CH 4 . The yields of CH 4 and CO increased with increasing S/C value at low S/C ratios. However, with the further increase in the S/C ratio, the yield of CH 4 gradually declined. The yield of CO, which was proportional to the amount of H 2 O, always increased with H 2 O content. In order to explain the fact that the simulated tar can be effectively transformed to small gas molecules at low S/C ratios (S/C < 1), it is proposed that the system mainly in- cludes two reactions as follows: C n H m (g) + nH 2 O(g) nCO(g) + (n+m/2)H 2 (g) (1) CH 4 (g) + H 2 O(g) (2)CO(g) + 3H 2 (g) Reaction (1) represents the catalytic steam reforming of to- luene or naphthalene to CO and H 2 , which is fast and irreversi- ble. Reaction (2) is the catalytic reaction of CO and H 2 to form CH 4 , which is slow but reversible. This reaction determines the product distribution. From reaction (1), more CO and H 2 are formed with an appropriate increase in H 2 O content, which enhanced the formation rate of CH 4 . In the meantime, H 2 O generated from reaction (2) participates in reaction (1) and im- proves the conversions of toluene and naphthalene. Eventually toluene and naphthalene gets completely converted at low S/C ratios. 3 Conclusions The Ni/Ce-ZrO 2 / -Al 2 O 3 catalysts prepared by a two step impregnation method showed excellent catalytic activity, sta- bility, and some sulfur tolerance in the hydrocracking of tolu- ene and naphthalene, which were model tar compounds in hot 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 20 40 60 80 100 (5) (4) (2) (3) S/C molar ratio C o nversi o n or yi el d (%) (1) Fig. 9.

The addition of Ce-ZrO 2 benefited the conversions of toluene and naphthalene and enhanced the yield of CH 4 . The steam in the reaction gas not only contributed to the conversion of tar components but also promoted the formation of CH 4 as well. References 1 Baker E G, Mudge L K.

Tel: +86-21-56338244 Ni/Ce-ZrO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Ce-ZrO2 contents and Ni loadings were prepared by a two step impregnation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption, and temperature-programmed reduction. The catalysts were used for the hydrocracking of toluene and naphthalene, which were model tar compounds in hot coke oven gas, under atmospheric pressure at 800 °C. They showed excellent catalytic activity, stability, and some sulfur tolerance. Both toluene and naphthalene was converted into light fuel gases even at a low mole ratio of steam to carbon (S/C = 0.44). During the testing period of 7 h, no coke deposition was observed on the surface of the catalysts. The results indicated that the addition of Ce-ZrO2 limited the sintering of Ni particles and enhanced the catalytic activity. The Ni/Ce-ZrO2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is promising for the direct removal of tar compounds in hot coke oven gas with low S/C ratios.
