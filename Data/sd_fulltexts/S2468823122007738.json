CuZnZrAl catalysts were synthesized by the co-precipitation and coprecipitation-ammonia methods and modified with Y and Ce promoters for the methanol steam reforming hydrogen production process. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed by XRD, BET, H2-TPR, and XPS methods. The methanol conversion, as well as CO selectivity of MSR at different temperatures, were investigated, and its stability was probed using repeated start and stop test to simulate the onboard hydrogen production process. The results showed that the methanol conversion of CuZnZrAl catalyst prepared by coprecipitation-ammonia method was 96.9% at a temperature of 270°C, S/C molar ratio of 1.2, and WHSV of 2.6 h−1, which was higher than that of 94.6% by the co-precipitation method. In addition, the best catalytic performance was obtained for the catalyst with Ce promoter addition using coprecipitation-ammonia method. The conversion was 100% at 270°C with a CO selectivity of only 0.31%, and the conversion remained 98.7% after 20 reactions were repeated.

Countries are embracing the concept of carbon neutrality and setting related goals, so building a renewable energy system is a crucial issue facing humanity today [2]. Hydrogen fuel cells are an efficient means of energy conversion, but pure hydrogen is difficult to store and transport [3]. Therefore, proton exchange membrane fuel cells using low-carbon alcohols (methanol and ethanol) as raw materials have received extensive attention [4]. Methanol, the third-largest commercial chemical in the world after ethylene and ammonia, is not only an important basic chemical raw material but also can be used as a fuel. As the simplest saturated alcohol, methanol, which is liquid at room temperature and pressure, is known as ‘liquid hydrogen storage’. Compared with methane or liquefied petroleum gas, it is easier to store and transport and has a higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and lower activation temperature [5,6]. According to the different reforming oxidants, the methanol reforming reaction for hydrogen production mainly includes methanol steam reforming(MSR) [7], partial oxidative reforming(POR) [8], and autothermal reforming(ATR) [9] three systems. The MSR reaction process is shown below (Eq.(1)), usually accompanied by the water-gas shift (WGS, Eq.(2)) and methanol decomposition(MD, Eq.(3)) [10]. (1) CH3OH + H2O → CO2 + 3H2, ΔH= 49.5KJ mol−1 (2) CO + H2O ⇆ CO2 + H2, ΔH= -41.17 KJ mol−1 (3) CH3OH → CO + 2H2, ΔH= 92.0 KJ mol−1 The reaction formula of ATR is shown below (Eq.(4),‘p’ is not 0 or 1). For the first time, Huang et al. [11] found that the conversion of methanol over Cu-based catalysts increased significantly after adding oxygen to the MSR system. Since then, the POR system has gradually been actively studied by scholars. (4) CH3OH+(1-P)H2O+1.5PO2→CO2+(3-P)H2, ΔH=49.5-241.8p KJ mol−1 MSR is expected to be one of the hydrogen production technologies to become the hydrogen source of proton exchange membrane fuel cells [12]. It is also one of the most anticipated hydrogen production methods. Its mild reaction conditions and high hydrogen content in the product make it of great research value. Combined with microreactor technology, it is expected to create an online mobile hydrogen production technology suitable for automobiles. There are two main types of catalysts currently used in MSR: copper-based catalysts and precious-metal-based catalysts [13]. Copper-based catalysts have good low-temperature reforming activity and can generate hydrogen with high selectivity under suitable conditions, which include CuO/SiO2 [14], CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 [15], CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 [16], CuO/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 [17], etc. Therefore, it is widely used in hydrogen production technology. Different preparation methods and conditions significantly affect the structure and properties of catalysts. The preparation methods of copper-based catalysts mainly include the impregnation method, precipitation method, rapid decomposition method, complex combustion method, etc., among which the co-precipitation method is the most common [18]. The steps of the co-precipitation method are to mix the nitrate solution with the alkaline solution. The main influencing factors are the type of the precipitant, the concentration of the precursor and the precipitant, the precipitation temperature, and the pH value [19]. In addition, the choice of different promoters also significantly impacts the performance of the catalyst [20]. According to the research, adding Zr, Ce, and La promoters to the CuO/A12O3 catalyst can promote the dispersion of copper and effectively prevent the aggregation and sintering of the copper lattice, which helps to improve the activity of the catalyst and increase its stability [21]. After modification by adding Zr based on CuO/ZnO/Al2O3, the activity and stability of the catalyst were improved [22]. On the one hand, the addition of Zr is beneficial to the dispersion of Cu, avoids the formation of CuAl2O4 spinel, increases the specific surface area of the catalyst, and thus improves the activity of the catalyst. On the other hand, the redox ability of the catalyst is improved, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst [23]. The existing disadvantage of Cu-based catalysts is the insufficient stability. Compared with noble metal catalysts, Cu is easier to sinter, resulting in a lower specific surface area [24]. Especially in the scene of on-board hydrogen production, repeated heating and cooling will inevitably occur. Therefore, how to prepare Cu-based catalysts with high stability is still the focus of current research. In our experiments, the CuZnAlZr catalyst was prepared by the coprecipitation-ammonia method, which was compared with the traditional co-precipitation method. Then, on the basis of CuZnZrAl, Y and Ce promoters were added to prepare CuZnX(Y, Ce)ZrAl catalyst. The methanol conversion and CO selectivity of MSR at different temperatures were investigated. At the same time, different from previous studies, we designed a new method for evaluating the stability of catalysts. For the vehicle application of the catalyst, the evaluation method of repeated start and stop was used to test the stability of the catalyst under repeated heating and cooling. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Co-precipitation method For the preparation of the CuZnAlZr catalyst by co-precipitation route, 0.5 M solution of the Na2CO3 was added dropwise to 0.1 M solution of a certain amount of metal nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O) with vigorous stirring until pH=8. Stirring was continued for 2 h and then age for 12 h. Afterwards, filtration and washed with 1 L of deionized water to eliminate the Na and nitrate residues, and dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Finally, calcined at 400 °C for 2 h, pressed into tablets, and grind to 20-35 mesh. Using the same method, CuZnYZrAl and CnZnCeZrAl catalysts were prepared. The precursors of Y and Ce were Y(NO3)3·6H2O and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, respectively. 2.1.2 Coprecipitation-ammonia method 0.5 M solution of the (NH4)2CO3 was added dropwise to 0.1 M solution of a certain amount of metal nitrate with vigorous stirring until pH=8. Then heated to 80 °C to evaporate ammonia until pH=6(about 3 h). After that, removed the water bath and continue stirring for 2 h, then aged, dried, calcined, and tableted, same as the co-precipitation method. Meanwhile, as a comparison, CZZA catalyst was prepared using (NH4)2CO3 as a precipitant using a co-precipitation method. The composition of all prepared catalysts is listed in Table 1 . 2.2 Catalytic activity test A self-built fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the performance of the catalyst in the MSR reaction at atmospheric pressure and 270 °C. The reactor was made of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm and an outer diameter of 8 mm. It was electrically heated by a vertical tube furnace. 2 g of each catalyst (20-35 mesh) was loaded into the reactor and secured with quartz wool at both ends of the reactor bed. The catalyst was first reduced by flowing 10% H2/N2 over the catalyst at 270 °C for 3 h before the reaction. The methanol-water mixed solution with a molar ratio of 1 to 1.2 and a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min (WHSV 2.6h−1) was first gasified and then entered into the fixed bed reactor. The contents of CO, CO2, H2O, and methanol in the products were analyzed online by gas chromatography (GC) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In addition, the catalyst was tested under repeated start and stop conditions to test its stability. It was reacted at a temperature of 270°C, S/C molar ratio of 1.2, and WHSV of 2.6 h−1 for 2 h, then lowered to room temperature and then heated to 270°C to continue the reaction and this was repeated 20 times. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD The XRD pattern of the calcined catalyst is shown in Fig. 1. The figure shows that all catalysts have CuO diffraction peaks at 2θ=38.8°, while the diffraction peaks at 2θ=34.4°, 35.7°, 56.5°, etc. are all attributed to the ZnO phase [25]. No diffraction peaks of ZrO2, Y2O3 and CeO2 were detected in the samples with the promoter added, indicating that these particles are in an amorphous state, which may inhibit the growth of CuO and ZnO crystallites through buffering and sequestration. When (NH4)2CO3 is used as a precipitant, a copper-ammonia complex (Cu(NH3)4)2+ is formed. The complex is soluble in water, resulting in a large loss of Cu. This may be the reason why CuO peak almost cannot be detected from CZZA (Cop/(NH4)2CO3) in the red curve [16]. After adding CeO2, a diffraction peak belonging to CexZr1-xO2 appeared. It has been reported that CexZr1-xO2 has a good ability to store and release oxygen and activate CO [26], which can reduce the CO content in the product. Moreover, it can increase the rate of dehydrogenation and dissociation of reactant methanol, thereby increasing the reaction rate and the conversion rate of the reaction [27]. The CuO crystallite size of different catalyst samples is shown in the Table 2 . CuO crystallite size in the CZZA catalyst prepared using the coprecipitation-ammonia method was 10.3 nm, significantly lower than 16.4 nm in the co-precipitation method. the addition of Y and Ce promoters to the CZZA catalyst also showed different degrees of CuO crystallite size reduction. The reduction was 13.7 nm with the addition of Y, and 10.5 nm with the addition of Ce. The smallest CuO crystallite size came from CZCZA (Co-Am) catalyst, which was 10.1 nm. The results showed that the change of preparation method and the addition of accelerant can reduce the crystallite size and improve the dispersion. 3.2 BET The BET specific surface areas and pore volume of the different catalysts are represented in Table 2. As can be seen from the table, the specific surface area of the catalysts prepared using the coprecipitation-ammonia method was 85.98 m2 g−1, which was higher than that of those prepared using the co-precipitation method. In addition, the specific surface area of the catalysts increased to different degrees after adding promoters. The specific surface area increased to 92.16 m2 g−1 after the addition of Ce using coprecipitation-ammonia method. The specific surface area of the catalysts affects the dispersion of the active components, which in turn affects the catalytic activity. This result indicated that the components in the CZCZA(Co-Am) catalyst were better dispersed, which was consistent with the XRD results. 3.3 H2-TPR The H2-TPR spectra of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. Researchers have shown that the reduction performance of the catalysts has an important influence on the catalyst activity [28]. As seen from the figure, only one reduction peak can be observed for all catalysts in the temperature range of 50-600 °C, which is the peak of Cu2+ being reduced to Cu0. It indicated that none of the oxides (ZnO, ZrO2, etc.) in the catalysts except CuO were reduced. The reduction temperature of the CZZA catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method was 240.1°C, and the catalyst prepared using the coprecipitation-ammonia method was 222.7°C, which was lower than that of the co-precipitation method. And the reduction temperatures of the two catalysts after adding Y and Ce promoters were 218.1°C and 213.5°C respectively, which were lower than the original CZZA catalyst. The lowest reduction temperature was 206.2°C from CZCZA(Co-Am) catalyst. The reduction peak shifted toward the lower temperature, indicating that the CuO particles dispersed on the catalyst surface were more easily reduced. In other words, the CuO particles in the CZCZA catalyst were smaller and better dispersed, which was consistent with the XRD results. 3.4 XPS The valence states of the surface species of CZCZA catalysts after calcination, reduction, and reaction were analyzed using an X-ray diffraction photoelectron spectroscopy analyzer. Fig. 3a shows the 2p orbital electron binding energy spectrum of surface Cu. It can be seen from the figure that the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 electron binding energies of Cu after calcining were 933.9 eV and 953.6 eV, respectively [29], and a peak appeared at 936-946 eV, which were characteristic of Cu2+ [30]. After reduction, the shake-up peak disappeared, the 2p3/2 electron binding energy of Cu decreased to 932.4 eV, and the peak was narrowed, indicating that Cu2+ had been reduced to Cu+ or Cu0, which was consistent with the H2-TPR results. Moreover, the characteristic peak of 2p3/2 electron binding energy of Cu broadened after the reaction. This indicated that some Cu0 and Cu+ have been oxidized. Fig.3b shows the 3d orbital electron binding energy spectrum of Ce. Two peaks at 882.7 eV and 902.6 eV were attributed to Ce3+, and two peaks at 898.2 eV and 915.4 eV were attributed to Ce4+ [31], indicating that Ce3+ and Ce4+ coexisted on the surface of the catalyst. During the MSR reaction, oxygen vacancies are required for the decomposition of H2O and the formation of H2, and surface oxygen species are required for the dissociation and oxidation of methanol [32]. The coexistence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ can coordinate the redox process, enhance the oxygen storage and release capacity of the catalyst, and provide oxygen vacancies and surface oxygen. Therefore, it promotes the dissociation of methanol and the decomposition of H2O and improves methanol conversion. In addition, CeO2 can oxidize the CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface to CO2, thus reducing the CO selectivity. Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d show the electron binding energy spectra of 2p orbitals of Zn and 3d orbitals of Zr, respectively. From the figures, it can be seen that the present states of Zn and Zr did not change before and after the reduction and after the reaction, and existed on the catalyst surface as ZnO and ZrO2, respectively. 3.5 SEM and EDX Fig. 4 shows the SEM results of prepared catalysts. As shown in the figure, all catalysts were spherical particles, and CZZA catalyst particles had a more general agglomeration phenomenon with many particles larger than 1 μm. After adding Y and Ce, the agglomeration phenomenon was significantly weakened. Especially, after adding Ce, the catalyst particles showed more regular small spheres with more homogeneous size. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra and dot mapping micrographs of promoted CZZA(Co-Am) and CZCZA catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5. The EDX results confirmed the coexistence of all metals on the catalyst surface. Based on EDX dot-mapping micrographs of the catalysts, Cu, Zn, Al, Zr and Ce were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst. 3.6 Catalytic activity The performance of the catalysts at different temperatures at S/C molar ratio of 1.2 and WHSV of 2.6 h−1 is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from the figure that the methanol conversion of all catalysts increased with increasing temperature, because the MSR reaction is a heat-absorbing reaction and increasing temperature is beneficial to the reaction. However, CO selectivity also increased with higher temperature, probably due to the fact that the WGS reaction is also heat absorbing. In the tested temperature range (190-290 °C), the methanol conversion of CZZA catalysts prepared by coprecipitation-ammonia method was greater than that of the co-precipitation method in all cases. Meanwhile, the addition of Y and Ce promoters resulted in significantly higher methanol conversion and significantly lower CO selectivity. Among them, the methanol conversion was 100% and CO selectivity was 0.31% at 270 °C after the addition of Ce using coprecipitation-ammonia mathod. It indicated that the addition of Ce improved the catalytic performance of the MSR reaction. 3.7 Catalytic stability test The stability of the catalyst in repeated start and stop tests are shown in the Fig. 7. According to the results, the products on all catalysts were mainly H2 and CO2, with a small amount of CO, and no other by-products re generated. It can be seen from the figure that the methanol conversion rate of the CnZnZrAl catalyst prepared by the traditional co-precipitation method was about 84.5% after the fifth reaction. Then the conversion rate gradually decreased with the increase of the number of reactions. After the 20th reaction, the conversion rate dropped to 82%. Studies have shown that the main reason for the deactivation of Cu-based catalysts is the thermal sintering of Cu crystallites [24]. A sudden drop in conversion was observed for all catalysts after the first reaction. It showed that the thermal sintering of Cu in the catalyst mainly occurs during the first cooling or the second heating process. At this stage, the Cu crystallites on the catalyst surface underwent severe sintering and aggregation, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area and a decrease in activity. We speculated that the reason for this phenomenon may also include that during the test, we took the reaction tube out of the reaction system after the reaction and exposed it to the air to cool down naturally. At this time, part of the Cu0 in the catalyst was at a higher temperature. It was oxidized to Cu2+ by oxygen in the air, resulting in the loss of active centers. In the subsequent reaction process, the catalytic activity decreased slowly with the increase in the number of reactions. In addition, in the third reaction, a slight recovery of methanol conversion was observed, which may be due to the H2 in the reaction product, which caused the catalyst to undergo a self-reduction process. The conversion rate of the catalyst prepared by the coprecipitation-ammonia method was stable at about 85% in the subsequent reaction test, which was higher than that of the traditional coprecipitation method. This result may be attributed to the smaller catalyst crystallite size and higher active phase dispersion of the catalyst prepared by the coprecipitation-ammonia method under the same catalyst ratio, which matched the characterization results. In addition, after adding a second promoter such as Y and Ce based on CZZA, the catalytic activity and stability were more obviously improved. Among them, after adding Y, the methanol conversion rate was 90% after 20 reactions. After adding Ce, the methanol conversion rate in the first 10 reactions was always 100%, and the subsequent reactions began to decrease slowly. The conversion rate was 97% after 20 reactions, which was significantly higher than other catalysts. The best stability came from the CZCZA(Co-Am) catalyst. The conversion rate was 98.7% after 20 reactions. Therefore, after adding Ce, the activity and stability of the catalyst were improved considerably. The reason for this phenomenon may be that Y2O3, CeO2 and ZrO2 are in amorphous state and they have good thermal stability of their own and do not sinter easily. They are uniformly dispersed between CuO and ZnO particles (EDX can prove this), which makes CuO better spaced apart from CuO and ZnO, weakening the sintering of CuO. The CO selectivity of different catalysts in the methanol steam reforming to hydrogen reaction is shown in Fig. 8. Under the same reaction conditions, the initial CO selectivity of the CZZA catalyst prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method was 3.4%. With the increase in reaction times, the CO selectivity gradually increased and rose to about 7% after 20 reactions. The CO selectivity of the CZZA catalyst prepared using the coprecipitation-ammonia method was about 6% after 20 reactions, which was slightly better than the former. In addition, the CO selectivity of the catalysts had a more significant decrease after the addition of Y and Ce promoters. The CO selectivity was maintained between 1-2% after 20 reactions with the addition of Y promoter. In comparison, the CO selectivity was significantly reduced to less than 1% with the addition of Ce promoter, which was significantly lower than that of the CZZA catalyst without the addition of promoter. The lowest CO selectivity came from the CZCZA (Co-Am) catalyst. CO selectivity was 0.31% after 20 reactions. This indicated that the addition of the accelerator Ce significantly reduced the CO selectivity. It was reported that CeO2 has good oxygen storage and releases the ability to oxidize the CO adsorbed on the surface to CO2, and the addition of ZrO2 can further enhance this ability [33]. In the study of Cao et al. [34], it was confirmed that the good oxygen storage and release ability helps to promote the water gas conversion reaction and inhibit its inverse reaction, thus reducing the production of CO. This is consistent with our experimental results. The significant reduction of CO selectivity in CZCZA catalysts may be due to the combined effect of Ce and Zr to improve the oxygen storage and release capacity of the catalysts. 4 Conclusion In this study, CuZnZrAl catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation and coprecipitation-ammonia methods, respectively, and modified with Y and Ce promoters based on CZZA catalyst for the MSR process. The following conclusions were obtained. The results showed when the reaction temperature increased, the conversion of the MSR process was increased. Still, it also improved the CO selectivity and increased the CO concentration in the tail gas. It was demonstrated by XRD, BET, and H2-TPR that using the coprecipitation-ammonia method can effectively improve the dispersion of each component in the catalyst, resulting in smaller active component crystallite size and larger catalyst specific surface area. The addition of promoters Y and Ce improved the stability of the CZZA catalyst. The catalyst was tested under repeated start and stop conditions in this experiment. It was reacted at a temperature of 270°C, S/C molar ratio of 1.2, and WHSV of 2.6 h−1 for 2 h, then lowered to room temperature and then heated to 270°C to continue the reaction, and this was repeated 20 times. After 20 reactions, the conversion of the catalyst with the addition of Y promoter increased from 82.9% to 91.6%, and the conversion with the addition of Ce was 97.7% after 20 reactions. The addition of Ce generated CexZr1-xO2, a composite oxide of Ce and Zr, which had an important effect on the performance of the catalyst. The presence of CexZr1-xO2 might reduce the crystallite size of CuO, and both CexZr1-xO2 and CeO2 had good oxygen storage and release ability, which could oxidize CO in the reforming tail gas to CO2 and reduce the CO content in the product. The CZCZA(Co-Am) catalyst possessed the highest methanol conversion (100%) and the lowest CO selectivity (0.31%) at a temperature of 270°C, S/C molar ratio of 1.2, and WHSV of 2.6 h−1.

        "dc:description": "CuZnZrAl catalysts were synthesized by the co-precipitation and coprecipitation-ammonia methods and modified with Y and Ce promoters for the methanol steam reforming hydrogen production process. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed by XRD, BET, H2-TPR, and XPS methods. The methanol conversion, as well as CO selectivity of MSR at different temperatures, were investigated, and its stability was probed using repeated start and stop test to simulate the onboard hydrogen production process. The results showed that the methanol conversion of CuZnZrAl catalyst prepared by coprecipitation-ammonia method was 96.9% at a temperature of 270°C, S/C molar ratio of 1.2, and WHSV of 2.6 h−1, which was higher than that of 94.6% by the co-precipitation method. In addition, the best catalytic performance was obtained for the catalyst with Ce promoter addition using coprecipitation-ammonia method. The conversion was 100% at 270°C with a CO selectivity of only 0.31%, and the conversion remained 98.7% after 20 reactions were repeated.",
