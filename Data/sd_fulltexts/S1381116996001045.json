Mol b Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninskii prospect 47, 117913 Moscow, Russia h Department of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 7018 WV Amsterdam, The Netherlands Abstract A new approach to the activation of Re207/A1203 and Re2o./A1203 * Si02 for low-temperature olefin metathesis has been developed. After heating in oxygen and then in vacuum at 873 K, the catalysts were subjected to y-irradiation from a 6o source in the presence of methane, butane, or carbon monoxide at ambient temperature. IR data revealed that, upon -y-irradiation, reduced Re species (metal ions in lower oxidation states and rhenium carbonyls) were produced. After evacuation at 293 or 423 K, catalytic activities of the y-irradiated samples for olefin metathesis at 293 K were measured. The turnover frequencies (TOF) in propene metathesis for the Re-catalysts irradiated in CH4 or CA, were found to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than those for the unirradiated catalysts. The TOF for the catalysts irradiated in CO significantly increased after treatment with cyclopropane at 293 K. In the liquid-phase metathesis of hex- l-ene, turnover numbers as high as 1100-2700 mot C6/mot Re (selectivity 90-98%) were obtained for the irradiated catalysts. It is suggested that y-irradiation in the presence of alkanes induces a series of chemical transformations of the supported metal ions and can produce surface metal-carbene complexes which are active intermediates in metathesis.

Introduction Alumina-supported rhenium oxide is one of the most active and stable catalysts for the metathesis of olefins at low temperatures [1,2]. At present a number of procedures are known for increasing the activity of this catalyst: (i) adding another transition-metal oxide (M003, V205, or W03), (ii) phosphating or borating the support, (iii) using silica-alumina instead of pure alumina as a support, and (iv) promoting the catalyst by treatment with a tetraalkyltin or a Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has been suggested that this effect is associated with the formation of organorhenium intermediates according to the following scheme [3]: 0 R,Sn Re SnR3 I ' o I'~ Re- R I 0 I 171-71-1 Supposedly, the Re-alkyl complexes formed can further isomerize via a proton transfer to 220 AL Tarasou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 yield Re-carbene complexes, which play a role whether or not 'y-irradiation can be applied for as active sites for olefin metathesis [4]: the activation of Re207/A1203 ' Si02 and Re207/A'203 catalysts.

Catalyst preparation and activation Thus, treating the original catalysts with R4Sn or R4Pb appreciably increases the concentration of active sites on the surface and thereby enhances their activity. Unfortunately, this procedure has substantial drawbacks. For instance, it is necessary to carry out repeated treatment with organometallic promoters to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation. This applies for all subsequent activation cycles. Hence, considerable amounts of heavy metals (Sri, Pb) accumulate on the catalyst, and finally, it completely and irreversibly loses its activity. Sn-and Pb-containing organic substances are highly toxic, and their presence on the catalysts is extremely undesirable, since they can also be incorporated into the reaction products. It is therefore of interest to search for alternative methods for activating Re-containing metathesis catalysts which do not entail the introduction of heavy metals. Earlier we developed a new efficient method for the activation of molybdena/silica metathesis catalysts [5,6]. This method involved lowtemperature photoreduction of M003/Si02 in carbon monoxide, during which supported Mo6+ ions are reduced to Moo+, followed by chemisorption of a carbene-donor compound such as cyclopropane, methylcyclopropane, or cycloheptatriene. These compounds interact with Mo4+ to form Mo-carbene complexes on the catalyst surface. Highly active catalysts for the metathesis of simple and functionalized olefins were obtained as a result of this two-step treatment. Instead of UV irradiation, 60CO y-irradiation can be used for M003/Si02 activation [7]. The aim of the present study is to determine The catalysts were prepared by impregnating the supports with aqueous solutions of ammonium perrhenate (Johnson Matthey, JMC 836 Specpure) followed by drying in air at 383 K. -y-A'203 (Ketjen CK 300, SN2 = 208 m2/g, particle size 180-250 R,m) and silica-alumina (Akzo, 24.3% of A1203, SN2 = 374 m2/g, particle size 180-250 p,m) were used as supports. Re207 contents in the samples were 3 and 6 wt%. A weighed portion of the catalysts was placed in a quartz ampoule connected to a vacuum line and heated in oxygen (200 Torr) at 823 K under static conditions for 2 h and then evacuated for 1 h at the same temperature. Following this, 400 Torr of CH4, rl-C4Hio or CO were admitted, and the ampoule was then sealed off. The samples were y-irradiated from a 6o source at ambient temperature until the dose of approximately 100 Mrad was attained. After y-irradiation the samples were evacuated and transferred into small breakable glass balls without exposure to air. Thermal reduction in CO or HZ was carried out in a static circulation system at a gas pressure of 80-100 Torr at 673 K. The reduction products were trapped at liquid nitrogen temperature. Photoirradiation in CH4 was performed using unfiltered light of a high-pressure mercury lamp DRSh-1000 (1 kW). 2.2. Reagents Propene and cyclopropane were purified by a triple freeze-thaw cycle with intermediate evacuation at 77 K. A.G. Tarasor et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane were freed from oxygen and other admixtures by passing them through a column filled with Cr2+/Si02. Pure grade hex- l-ene was refluxed over KOH for 2 h and a middle fraction was collected by distillation (- 80%) which was then refluxed over CaH2 for 2 h. This procedure was repeated twice. Finally, hex- l-ene was distilled under Ar. 2.3. Measurements of catalytic activities in propene and hex-1-ene metathesis Catalytic activities in both reactions were measured at room temperature. In propene metathesis, the gaseous mixture was circulated through the catalyst bed (0.15-0.2 g) in a volume of 570 cm3 (initial propene pressure was 44 Torr). The compositions of gaseous mixtures were determined using a UTI-100C quadruple mass-spectrometer connected to the circulation system through a leak valve. Hex-l-ene metathesis was carried out under Ar in a reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and connected to a burette for measuring the amounts of ethene evolved. A breakable glass ball with a catalyst sample (0.15-0.2 g) was broken in the reactor under the layer of hex-1ene (10 cm'), the magnetic stirrer was then switched on, and the amounts of ethene evolved were measured at different time intervals. In some experiments, after attaining hexene conversions of - 50%, another 10 cm3 of hexene was added. The metathesis products were analyzed with a LKhM-8D gas chromatograph. 2.4. Spectroscopic measurements IR diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 580B instrument in the 2300-1900 cm--' range using a home-made attachment. For optical measurements, the samples were placed in quartz cuvettes supplied with CaF2 windows. 221 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic activities of y-irradiated Re207/ A1203 ' Si02 and Rez07/AI203 in propene metathesis In the present work, we studied the effect of preliminary y-irradiation of 3 and 6 wt% Re207/A1203 - Si02 and Re207/A1203 in carbon monoxide, methane, and n-butane on their catalytic activities in propene metathesis. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The specific activities of the catalysts were determined in the following way. Linear transforms for each kinetic curve xb,,, = f(t), where xb is the butene fraction in the gas mixture and t is the reaction time, were plotted in the coordinates In[1 + (0.5 ~Keq - 1) xbUt]/[1 - (0.5 VKeq + 1) xb] - t, where Kq is the equilibrium constant of the propene metathesis reaction. This equation was obtained earlier [8] assuming a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism for propene metathesis. Typical linear transforms for 6 wt% Re207/Al,03 * Si02 activated by various procedures are shown in Fig. 1. Specific activities of the catalysts (TOF) were determined from the slopes of the straight lines. As seen from Table 1, the catalytic activities of the samples irradiated in CH 4 and C4H10 are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of untreated samples (compare Runs 2, 3, 9 and 12 with Runs 1, 8, and 1 t). This effect is most pronounced for 6 wt% Re207/A1203. y-Irradiation in CO somewhat decreases the activity (Run 4). However, after cyclopropane adsorption, the activity sharply increases. This effect is even more pronounced after evacuation of the y-irradiated sample at 423 K (Run 5). This is probably due to the removal of adsorbed radiolysis products at elevated temperatures, as a result of which subsequent cyclopropane chemisorption is more efficient. The activities of the y-irradiated catalysts decrease as the metathesis reaction proceeds. Thus, for example, exposure of 6 wt% 222 AL Tarasou et al. /Joumal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 Re207/Al203 * Si02, pre-y-irradiated in CH4 or CO, to an equilibrium mixture of the metathesis products for 1 h reduces the activity by a factor of - 20 (Runs 3 and 5). However, after evacuation at 423 K, the activity again increases and almost reaches its initial value. Hence, the decrease in activity is reversible and probably due to adsorption of the metathesis products which block the active sites. The activities of the catalysts thermally reduced in CO at 673 K or in H2 at 723 K (Runs 6, 10, and 14), as well as those of the samples photoirradiated in CH4 (Run 7) were also measured. These treatments do not give rise to highly active catalysts. Moreover, after photoreduction or thermal reduction in H2, the activities are even smaller than those of the original untreated samples. These reduction procedures evidently do not yield rhenium ions in the valent states necessary for the formation of catalytically active sites. -y-Irradiated samples are sensitive to oxygen: following exposure to Oz at room temperature, their activity diminishes drastically (Run 2). As indicated above, the active sites for propene metathesis are stable at 423 K. However, they are irreversibly destroyed at higher temperatures (573 K) (Run 9). A characteristic feature of the y-irradiated Re207/Al203 * Si02 catalysts is the occurrence of side reactions, which somewhat decreases their selectivity. Small amounts of CS-Cg alkenes are found, which are most likely formed by cross-metathesis of propene and but-l-ene.

The latter is probably produced by the doublebond shift in but-2-ene, the major product of propene metathesis. It should be emphasized that the metathes selectivity is higher for yirradiated Re207/Al2O3. It is evident from Table 1 that cyclopropane treatment of y-irradiated Re207/Al2O3 ~ Si02 and Re207/Al2O3 results in an appreciable increase in their catalytic activities. By analogy with the earlier studied M06 +/S'02 catalysts photoreduced in CO [5,6], we can assume that rhenium-carbene complexes are produced by cyclopropane adsorption. We attempted to estimate the number of adsorption sites. The number of cyclopropane molecules adsorbed on a y-irradiated 6 wt% Re207/Al2O3'S'O2 sample after evacuation at 423 K was determined to be 2.1 X 1019 g-- The number of cyclopropane molecules adsorbed on the y-irradiated support alone was 6.3 X 10' g g -' . Thus, the number of cyclopropane molecules adsorbed on reduced rhe- 223 nium species is 1.5 X 10'9 g-' or 9.9% of the total rhenium content in the sample. Similar measurements were performed for a 6 wt% (Re207/A1203 sample 'y-irradiated CO. The numbers of cyclopropane molecules adsorbed on irradiated and on untreated samples were 2.0 X 10'9 and 6.4 X 1018 g-', respectively, i.e., the number of sites capable of cyclopropane adsorption is 9.1 % of the total rhenium content in the sample. Hence, about 10% of the rhenium species adsorbs cyclopropane and could yield carbene complexes. However, this is only an upper estimate for the number of Re-carbene sites due to the plausible occurrence of side reactions (for example, isomeration of cyclopropane to propene). 3.2. Catalytic activities of y-irradiated Re207/ AL203 ~ Si02 and Re207/A1203 catalysts in liquid-phase hex-1-ene metathesis The activities of -~-irradiated Re207/Al 203 Si02 and Re207/A'2O3 in liquid-phase hex-1ene metathes are given Table 2. The most important characteristics of the catalysts is their productivity, i.e., the number of moles of hex- 1ene converted on 1 mole of Re until complete deactivation of the catalyst (TON). The productivities of all the studied catalysts fall in the interval from 1000 to 2700 regardless of the activation procedure. A comparison with literature data shows that the productivities of the y-irradiated samples are not inferior to those activated by treatment with organometallic promoters. For instance, the maximum productivity of 2.8% Re(acac)3/A1203 activated by Pb(Et)4 in hex-l-ene metathesis at SO and at the olefin/Re = 5000 ratio is 1460 mole of hexene per 1 mole of Re [9]. It should be also noted that the y-irradiated support alone is completely inactive (Table 2, Run 7), which indicates that y-irradiation in CO and alkanes is an efficient method of catalyst activation. An analysis of the data of Table 2 reveals that the selectivity relative to CIO production (dec-5-ene) is substantially dependent on the N N A a h Table 2 p Catalytic activities of RCZ07 /AIZO3'Si02 and Rez07/A'Z03 in hex-l-ene metathesis (T=293 K, hexene/Re=2000-3000, y-irradiation dose 100 Mrad) 0 Run Treatment Reaction C6 conversion Product composition (%) Selectivity Productivity (TON) No. time (h) (%) Ce C, Cs C9 Cio Cnto C,o (%) (mot C6 /mol Re) 6 wt% Re207 /Al107 ' Si02 fi 1 y-irradiation in CO, evacuation at 293 K, 48 42.1 2.2 57.9 3.2 0.8 3.4 32.3 0.2 90.2 1130 cyclopropane adsorption at 293 K 2 ~y-irradiation in CH4, evacuation at 293 K 1 46.1 2.0 53.9 1.2 0.4 2.0 40.3 0.2 94.2 1150 48 81.8 2.6 18.2 11.0 3.5 15.0 48.5 0.7 66.7 1710 3 y-irradiation in CQH,o, evacuation at 293 K 1 27 1.6 73.0 0.8 0.1 1.3 23.1 0.1 96.1 920 3 wt% ReZ07 /AIZO; ' Si02 1 4 y-irradiation in CH4, evacuation at 293 K a 1 30.3 2.5 69.7 1.0 0.2 1.7 24.8 0.1 94.5 1600 48 66.6 3.0 33.4 7.4 1.7 11.0 42.9 0.4 76.3 2740 s~ 6 wt% ReZ07 /AI20, 5 y-irradiation in CH4, evacuation at 293 K 1 58.8 0.2 41.2 0.2 0.1 1.1 57.2 - 98.6 1050 y 24 b 52.0 0.2 48.0 0.2 0.1 l.0 50.5 - 98.5 2000 n 6 y-irradiation in CO, evacuation at 423 K, 1 46.0 0.1 54.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 44.6 - 98.6 1050 cyclopropane adsorption at 293 K 24 b 40.6 0.2 59.4 0.2 0.1 1.1 39.0 - 98.5 1860 ,r A1203'Si02 7 -y-irradiation in CH4, evacuation at 293 K 1 Traces V a Repeated y-irradiation after heating the sample in OZ and then in a vacuum at 823 K. b Another 10 cm' of hex-l-ene is added. `o i N N a A.L.

It is higher than 94% for shorter contact times (1 h), but the selectivity to CIO for Re207/A'2O3 Si02 for longer contact times (24-48 h) decreases markedly (Runs 2 and 4). This is apparently due to the double-bond shift catalyzed by the acid sites of the support. The resulting isomerizationproducts then metathesize yielding a whole variety of products ranging from C; to C ,. However, the selectivity of Re207/A'2O3 samples (Runs 5 and 6) remains high enough even for longer contact times (24 h). 3.3. Diffuse reflectance IR spectra of y-irradiated Re207/20i 02 and Re207/A1203 Fig. 2a shows the IR spectrum of a 6 wt% Re,,O7/203 Si02 sample y-irradiated in CO in the range of CO stretching vibrations (2300- 225 2000 cm-' ). The spectrum is rather complex and consists of a series of absorption bands which complicate unambiguous interpretation. Nevertheless, some of the absorption bands (ABs) can be reliably assigned. The two higher frequency ABs (at 2205 and 2240 cm-1) can be detected only in the presence of CO in the gas phase. They completely disappear after evacuation of the sample at 293 K, whereas the intensities of other bands do not change significantly. The bands reappear after admission of CO. These bands can be attributed to CO molecules weakly adsorbed an two different types of sites on the A1203 ~ Si02 surface, probably on aprotic sites of the support [ 10] and/or on radiation-induced defects. The lower frequency ABs in Fig. 2a (at 2160, 2104, 2050, 2010, and a shoulder at 2120 cm-' ) should be assigned to complexes of CO with reduced rhenium species produced during yirradiation in CO. The thermal stability of these complexes differs significantly. The most stable complex is characterized by an AB at 2050 cm-'. The intensity of this band remains almost unchanged upon evacuation of the sample even at 573 K (Fig. 2d), whereas the other bands already vanish at 423 K (Fig. 2b). The 2050 cm-' band can be attributed to rhenium tricarbonyl complexes, which were earlier identified on alumina and silica surfaces and characterized by two major IR ABs at - 2030 and 1915--1920 cm-' [10-15]. The latter band is beyond the limit of our IR measurements because of the strong light absorption by A1203 ~ Si02. The surface tricarbonyl complexes were found to be thermally stable, because in situ IR measurements have shown that CO loss occurs only at temperatures exceeding 573 K [ 12]. The lowest frequency band at 2010 cm-' which disappears upon evacuation at 423 K and reappears after CO admission can be attributed to CO adsorbed on metal rhenium in a linear form [ 10]. The ABs at 2160, 2120 and 2104 (2090) cm-' in Fig. 2a and 2c, which behave similarly to the one at 2010 cm-', most likely belong to CO complexes with reduced rhenium 226 A.L. Tarasov et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 ions. It is generally accepted that the lowering of CO stretching-vibration frequencies in M\"+...CO complexes is associated with an increase in the electron-donor ability of the metal ions, i.e., the lower the oxidation state, the lower the frequency. Taking this into account, we can assign ABs at 2160, 2120, and 2104 (2090) cm-' to Re\"+ carbonyl complexes, where n:5 6. The actual oxidation state of the rhenium species cannot be deduced more precisely from the present data. The question arises as to which of the ABs observed can be attributed to those Re ions which are the precursors of the active sites in metathesis. To answer this question, we can compare the spectrum of the Re207/A1203 Si02 sample y-irradiated in CO, evacuated at 423 K and then exposed to CO (Fig. 2c), with the spectrum of the same sample, which was recorded after evacuation at 573 K and CO readmission (Fig. 2e). The former corresponds to the active catalyst (see Tables 1 and 2), whereas the latter is characteristic of the completely deactivated catalyst. The major difference between the two spectra is the absence of a weak AB at 2090 cm-' in the spectrum of the deactivated sample'. This band could correspond to CO complexes with those Re\"+ ions that yield the carbene-type transient structures involved in metathesis. The valence state of these ions cannot be unambiguously deduced from the IR spectra. However, taking into consideration the relatively low vco value in the complex and the presence of two higher frequency bands in the spectrum in Fig. 2c (at 2160 and 2120 cm-' ), we can assume that the rhenium in this complex has an oxidation state lower than 6 + or even 5 + . The IR spectrum of Re20.7/A1203 y-irradiated in methane recorded in the presence of CO (Fig. 3) is similar to that of Re207/Al203 Si02. The background of the support is less I The absence of AB at 2240 cm-I in the spectrum in Fig. 2e is most likely associated with the annealing of the sites for physical adsorption of CO as a result of heating at 573 K. 2160 2100 _ 1940 200 20352010 b 1 1 I I 2200 2100 2000 1900 v cm 1 Fig. 3.

The ABs at 2160 and 2100 cm-' are assigned to Re\"+...CO complexes, whereas those at 2060, 2035, 2010 and 1940 cm-' are attributed to rhenium carbonyls and linearly bonded CO on metal rhenium clusters. After cyclopropane adsorption at 293 K on Re207/A1203 ~ Si02 and Re207/A1203 yirradted in CO, we could not find any new ABs in the range of C-H stretching vibrations (2800-3000 cm-'). Thus, we were not able to detect possible formation of 7r-complexes or Re\"+=CH2 after cyclopropane adsorption by IR. 4. Discussion The present study allows us to unambiguously conclude that y-irradiation of rhenium catalysts in the presence of CO and alkanes causes reduction of supported rhenium ions, which originally have an oxidation state of 7 + . This emerges from the IR spectra of -y-irradiated Re207/A1203 ~ S'02 and Re207/A1203 recorded under CO atmosphere, in which a set of ABs arising from complexes of CO with reduced Re ions can be clearly seen (Figs. 2 and 3). Radiation reduction occurs non-selectively and leads to the formation of rhenium ions in various oxidation states. A.L. Tarasou et al. I Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 For 6 wt% Re207/A'Z03 ' Si02 y-irradiated in CO, we were able to determine the mean oxidation state of rhenium by measuring the amount of COZ formed during irradiation. This value was found to be 6.3, i.e., the reduction is not very pronounced. Thermal reduction of 6 wt% Re207/A1203 * Si02 in CO proceeds much more deeply: the mean oxidation states for rhenium in this case were 5.9 and 5.1 at 623 and 673 K, respectively. Photoreduction of the rhenium catalysts in CO turned out to be inefficient. No COz or other photoreduction products were found. This can be explained by proposing that an excited charge-transfer complex, which could be formed as a result of photon absorption, deactivates very rapidly and thus has extremely low probability for reacting with any reducing molecules. The following reaction scheme can be assumed for the radiation reduction in CO: II//o T o- ~ % rs II/Z CO Re .~=-E' Re- -s Re, =-s Re -CO= I -C2H\" I 0 0 The energy of a y-quantum is mainly absorbed by the support 2 and further transferred to the surface rhenium species. An excited charge-transfer complex which is formed in this process reacts with CO molecule yielding COZ and, thus, Re 7+ is reduced to Re s+. The latter can react with cyclopropane giving rise to Re=CHZ carbene complexes active in metathesis. This explains a sharp increase in the activity and productivity in metathesis of y-irradiated in CO samples after cyclopropane treatment (Tables 1 and 2). An analogous reaction of photoproduced Mo4+ ions with cyclopropane on the We believe that direct absorption of y-quanta by the surface rhenium ions is a low-probability process because of relatively small concentration of these ions. Although principally possible, this process does not contribute appreciably to the radiation reduction. 227 silica surface has been thoroughly studied in [5,6]. Taking into account a rather high mean oxidation state of rhenium in the catalysts reduced by y-irradiation (Z=6.3) and the fact that less than 10% of the reduced Re ions can adsorb cyclopropane to yield carbene complexes (see Section 3.1), we can conclude that only a small fraction of the rhenium is involved in the metathesis reactions. Upon y-irradiation in alkanes, Re-carbenes are formed by the following hypothetical scheme: 0 ~II% . oll/ . of/ ~~I/0 OH ~H \\~I/' RO r RO- -~ RrCH, -iRscCHi'-s Re I I I I -\",I 0 0 0 0 0 ii~ ii~ ii~ i,Wi7i i.ai A key step in the above scheme is the interaction of methane (or alkane) molecule with the excited Re-complex, which results in the formation of the Re-CH 3 (or Re-R) bond. Possibly, Re=CHZ (or Re = R') is yielded by the subsequent proton transfer or by the elimination of a molecule of water. The above schemes for radiation reduction and formation of Re-carbenes are only hypotheses; they do not account for all the experimental data obtained (for example, formation of reduced rhenium ions in various valence states). Nevertheless, they can explain the effect of cyclopropane treatment and activation under irradiation in the presence of alkanes. It is of interest to compare specific activities for the y-irradiated catalysts and those obtained earlier with the same catalysts but under different reaction conditions, i.e., in a fixed-bed flow reactor at a higher pressure and reaction temperature [ 16]. According to [ 16], TOFs in propene metathesis at 323 K at a C3H6:Na ratio of 1:2 (P = 1.5 arm) are equal to 100 X 10-3 and 130 X 10-3 s-1 for 6 and 3 wt% Re207/A1203 Si02, respectively, and to 10 X 10-3 s-' for 6 wt% Re207/A1203. A comparison of these values with the TOF for the untreated catalysts 228 AL Tarasov et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 219-228 (Table 1, Runs 1, 8, and 11) reveals qualitative agreement between the two series of data, that is Re207/A1203 * Si02 is much more active than Re207/Al203. However, there is no quantitative consistency between the above results, probably, due to a higher reaction temperature [ 16] (by 30 K) and to the difference in the reaction conditions. It should, however, be emphasized that the TOF for y-irradiated Re207/A1203 ' Si02 and Re207/A1203 do not differ appreciably. Thus, we can draw the conclusion that yirradiation under a reducing atmosphere is an efficient method for the activation of rheniumcontaining catalysts. It allows repeated use of the same catalyst samples after their complete deactivation. This is achieved by second, third, and further y-irradiations of the samples preheated at high temperatures in oxygen. A certain drawback of the y-irradiated Re207/A1203 Si02 catalysts is the occurrence of side reactions (double-bond shift in alkenes on acid sites), which somewhat reduces the selectivity of metathesis. Rez07/A1203 is free of this drawback.

A new approach to the activation of Re2O7/Al2O3 and Re2O7/Al2O3 · SiO2 for low-temperature olefin metathesis has been developed. After heating in oxygen and then in vacuum at 873 K, the catalysts were subjected to γ-irradiation from a 60Co source in the presence of methane, butane, or carbon monoxide at ambient temperature. IR data revealed that, upon γ-irradiation, reduced Re species (metal ions in lower oxidation states and rhenium carbonyls) were produced. After evacuation at 293 or 423 K, catalytic activities of the γ-irradiated samples for olefin metathesis at 293 K were measured. The turnover frequencies (TOF) in propene metathesis for the Re-catalysts irradiated in CH4 or C4H10 were found to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than those for the unirradiated catalysts. The TOF for the catalysts irradiated in CO significantly increased after treatment with cyclopropane at 293 K. In the liquid-phase metathesis of hex-1-ene, turnover numbers as high as 1100–2700 mol C6/mol Re (selectivity 90–98%) were obtained for the irradiated catalysts. It is suggested that γ-irradiation in the presence of alkanes induces a series of chemical transformations of the supported metal ions and can produce surface metal-carbene complexes which are active intermediates in metathesis.
