of Lund, P.O.B. 740, S-220 07 Lund (Sweden) Summary Like a proton or a base, an electron or a positive hole can act as a very efficient catalyst in an organic reaction that in itself does not involve a change in oxidation level in going from substrate to product. If an electron is added to or removed from a neutral molecule, a radical anion (cation) is formed (eqn. i), and can undergo reactions at the new oxidation level (eqn. ii). At a later stage of the reaction sequence, a return to the original oxidation level can be achieved by a chain transfer step, i.e., a chemically different radical anion (cation) can reduce (oxidize) a new molecule of the starting material (eqn. iii). A^^A-^) (i) ,, , one or several steps ., . A--(+-) i-^B--<+-) (il) B--(+-)+A ^B+A-^ (iii) A familiar example of this reaction type is the SRNI reaction (devel- oped and studied by Bunnett, Komblum, Russell and Saveant in 1965 - 1980) which enables otherwise extremely slow aromatic nucleophilic substi- tution reactions to take place under mild conditions. Other examples, to be discussed in this paper, include the Sopi ^d SoN2 reactions, cyclo- dimerizations and cycloreversions, cycloadditions in general, rearrangements, oligomerizations and ligand exchange reactions. In general, catalytic effects of the order of 10 - 20 kcal/mol can be attained by electron transfer catal- ysis. Introduction: the S^l mechanism Every chemist is familiar with the concept of acid-base catalysis since his/her first acquaintance with organic reactions. The addition or removal 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 28 of a proton to or from an organic molecule (eqns. 1 and 2) brings about profound reactivity changes and promotes rate accelerations of many orders of magnitude. It is considerably less known that holes and electrons can play RH+BH'-^^RHs'^+B: RH + B: ?=^ R~ + BH\"1\" (1) (2) an analogous catalytic role, as illustrated in eqns. 3 and 4. By removal or addition of an electron from or to a neutral organic molecule, respectively, RH - e- ;=^ RH^ (3) RH + e- ;=i RH- (4) we can create a hole-carrying radical cation or an electron-carrying radical anion, respectively. By appropriate manipulation of the rich, but largely unexplored, chemistry of these species [1,2] it is possible to develop truly catalytic processes in which the hole/electron moves along a regularly repeating series of intermediates, thus setting up a chain reaction with a net chemical change as a result [3]. However, the big difference between acids/bases and holes/electrons is that the latter cannot be kept neat in bottles but demand special arrange- ments with respect to storage and 'packaging' materials. Thus holes/electrons can be stored in batteries (or generated in power stations for instant con- sumption) and supplied to solutions, then called electrolytes, via electrodes, holes being transferred at the anode and electrons at the cathode. Perhaps more familiar as storage materials are metal ions, metals and certain types of organic compounds, highly substituted with I-, E-substituents [4,5]. Examples are given below: Storage of electrons K, Na, Li Sn,Fe Cr(II), Co(I) Storage of holes Fe(III), Ag(II), Cu(II)/(III) Ce(IV), Co(III) 2,3-dichloro-4,5-dicyanobenzoquinone A different mode of creating holes/electrons exists in the photochem- ical generation of excited states of suitable organic molecules [6]. An excited state can act as a sink/source of electrons toward other species present, depending on the donor/acceptor properties of the latter. Generally, excited states can be considered strong reductants/oxidants in the proper context. The best known case of electron transfer chain (ETC) catalysis is no doubt the S^l reaction [7-9] which formally looks exactly like an ordi- nary substitution reaction (eqn. 5), with no change of oxidation state between substrate and product. However, when we realize that R can be a RX + Nu- > RNu + X- (5) 29 nonactivated aryl group it is obvious that something special is required to make the reaction go at a reasonable rate. And this is injection of electrons, performed cathodically, via addition of an alkali metal or by photolysis. The mechanism has by now been established in its broad outlines (eqns. 6 - 9) as a chain reaction where the propagation steps depend on the ease RX+e- >RX-' RX-' >R- +X- R' +Nu- ^-RNu-' RNu- + RX > RNu + RX- (6) (7) (8) (9) of cleavage of RX\" into R' and X~ and the differing bond strengths of the R X~' and R Nu\" bonds. Normally, the catalytic efficiency is mod- erate to low, reflecting the propensity for electrons and radicals to react rather indiscriminately and thus to create many possibilities for chain terminating processes. The best catalytic yields so far recorded, a quan- tum yield of up to 50, appears to be in the photochemical initiation of the reaction between iodobenzene and diethyl phosphite [lOa], and in the electrochemical initiation of the reaction between 2-chloroquinoline and diethyl phosphite ion [lOb] where the chain length was ca. 100. Another reaction [lOc] which in principle should be capable of showing very long chains is the electrochemically induced rearrangement of S,S-diarylbenzene-l,2-dicarbothioates to the isomeric 3,3-bis(arylthio)- phthalides (an intramolecular Snnl reaction). This reaction is initiated by a short period of electrolysis (3 min, with a charge dose of 0.05 F moF1) after which no more initiation is needed; the reaction runs to completion by itself for 1 - 2 h. As described here the chain length is 20 but it should be possible to improve this number considerably by alternative modes of operation, e.g. pulse electrolysis. The Soal reaction The SRNI mechanism is now a well-established concept in physical organic chemistry, thanks to the efforts of Bunnett [7a], Komblum [7b], Russell [8,11] and Saveant [9], and will be used here as the solid bridge- head in the territory of similar, albeit so far much less well documented and corroborated, chemistry. Alder paved the way for this development in a 1980 paper [12] in which the ETC concept was extended to include a number of previously unrelated phenomena [see also 3b], inspired by the finding [13] that oxidants (SaOg2\", VO*, Ar^\"1\") strongly catalyze the inside protonation of the bicyclic amine 1 in 70% sulfuric acid/water (eqn. 10). If the reaction is conducted in deuteriosulfuric acid/deuterium oxide instead, inside protonation occurs, showing that the inside proton originates from a position or to nitrogen, and in addition extensive exchange of Q! 30 hydrogens (but no others) takes place. The exchange mechanism was pro- posed to be of the ETC type, and was denoted the Sogi mechanism (electro- philic substitution, catalyzed by an oxidant and with a crucial dissociative step = eqn. 12), outlined in eqns. 11 -14. This mechanism is perfectly RH ^RH^ (11) RH^ + B: ^ R' + BH-*- (12) R- + BD* ^ RD-\" + B: (13) RD^ + RH ;= RD + RH^ (14) RH = RiNCHi-H in accordance with the known acidic properties of many radical cations. Aminylium radical cations especially would be expected to be strong acids, in view of the unusually weak a-C H bond that already exists in their parent compounds [14] (see below). The mechanism has been further strengthened by CIDNP experiments, showing fast proton exchange between aminylium radical cations and protic species [15]. The SONS reaction Another oxidatively initiated mechanism proposed by Alder, the SoN2 mechanism (nucleophilic substitution, catalyzed by an oxidant and with a crucial associative step = eqn. 16) is shown in eqns. 15 -18; the net ArX ^ArX-\" (15) ArX^ + Nu- > Ar(X)Nu (16) Ar(X)Nu > ArNu-1-' + X- (17) ArNu4\" + ArX > ArNu + ArX-*- (18) reaction is identical to that of the SRNI mechanism (eqn. 5) with R equal to an aryl group. It turned out that several examples of this reaction were already described in the literature [16-18], although its possible chain nature was only hinted at once [16]. Equation 19 shows the case studied 4-MeOC6H4F + AcO- -\"^M-MeOC^OAc + F- (19) 31 most extensively so far, acetoxyl/fluorine exchange in 4-fluoroanisole. The reason for the emphasis on this particular reaction, apart from the fact that ipso attack is predominant and thus provides a clearcut case, rests upon fluoride ion being the leaving group in eqn. (17). In principle, other leaving groups are feasible, but could be mechanistically ambiguous due to the fact that step 17 might be formulated as an oxidative step if X corresponds to an oxidizable X~. Thus bromine might for example leave from Ar(X)Nu in a bromine atom transfer process which obviously is a chain breaking step. Fluorine is not subject to this source of ambiguity, since a fluorine atom transfer step is very unlikely. The SoN2 reaction of eqn. (19) can be initiated by the anode [18,19] (with maximally ca. 300% current yield of ArOAc at low conversion), by Ag(II) [20], Co(III)Wi204o5- [21], and photochemically [16]. Moreover, a direct entry into the second propagation step (eqn. 17) was found in eqn. 20, where benzoyloxyl radical from the thermal decomposition of benzoyl ArF + PhCOO' > Ar(F)OCOPh (20) peroxide is used to initiate the chain process from eqn. (17) and onwards [22]. The only difference between eqns. 17 and 20 is that the hole has been transferred between the reactants (and acetoxyl changed for benzoyloxyl, but this is only for experimental convenience). The first cycle thus gives ArOCOPh, whereas with acetate ion present as Nu~ the following cycles will of course produce ArOAc. From the ArOAc/ArOCOPh ratio a chain length of 7 - 8 cycles was inferred. Without acetate ion present the yield of benzoate was unchanged but the aryl acetate yield was drastically curtailed (by a factor of more than 10). A literature search revealed that a fair number of SON 2-type reactions have been reported previously [18] and sometimes commented upon as 'interesting'. Table 1 lists representative cases, together with reactions for which the first pieces of mechanistic evidence have been assembled (Nos. 6, 10 -12, 16). It should be noted that the list of formally feasible SoN2 reactions can be extended considerably if we also allow for leaving groups for which step 17 can, at least in principle, be replaced by an atom or radical transfer step. As already mentioned above, the leaving group would then be oxidized off and the oxidant would be used stoichiometrically. This would however not constitute a chain reaction but a 'conventional' oxidative substitution process [36]. Few of the reactions of Table 1 exhibit yields characteristic of chain reactions, but then it should be remembered that little experimentation has so far been guided by the novel concept of the SoN2 mechanism. Moreover, as often encountered in oxidation processes, the product is more easily oxidized than the starting material and in some cases one actually marvels at the fact that any product at all survives the harsh conditions (from the oxidation point of view; e.g. PhOH in the presence of Cu(III)). A third factor making the SoN2 reaction experimentally difficult to detect is that chloro- and fluoroaromatic radical cations, as most other aromatic radical 32 TABLE 1 Representative cases of SoN2-type reactions Reaction Substrate No Initiator/Nu Product Ref. 1 PhCl anode/CFaCOO\" PhOCOCF3(2) 23 2 PhCl Co(III)/CF3COO- PhOCOCF3 (6) 24 3 PhCl Pb(IV)/CF3COO- PhOCOCF3 (trace) 25 4 PhCl SaOg^-Fe^-FeaiIVHiO PhOH(2) 26 5 PhCl Cu(III)/CF3COOH-H20 PhOH (35)b 19, 27 6 l,4-Cl2C6H4 Cu(III)/CF3COOH-H20 4-ClC6H40H(132)b 27 7 PhF Cu(III)/CP3COOH-H,0 PhOH (44)1' 19, 27 8 PhF SiOg^-CuOII-FeW/HiO PhOH (30)*' 28 9 4-MeC6H4Cl Cu(II)-02/OH- 4-MeC6H40HC 29 10 4-MeOC6H4F hr/CN\" or anode 4-MeOC6H4CN (95)'1 16 11 4-MeOC6H4Cl hr/CN- 4-MeOC6H4CN (89)d 16 12 4-MeOC6H4F anode/AcO\" 4-MeOCfiH40Ac (270)b 18, 19 13 4-MeOC(,H4F hr/AcCr 4-MeOC6H40Ac(20) 16 14 4-MeOC6H4Br anode/CF3COOH 4-MeOCsH40COCF3 30 15 (Y' Rh(III) (>350)b 31 ^\"(W^OH 16 PhCNi Cu(II) or Ar3N+ Ph2C=CPh2 (4000)b 32 17 chloroferrocene Cu(II)/AcO- acetoxyferrocene 33, 34 18 4-MC2NC6H4F anode/AcO\" no reaction0 33 a0rdinary chemical yields, unless otherwise stated. b Based on the amount of initiator. \"Without oxygen present, a switch from an So^-type to an aryne mechanism takes place.

This side- reaction is stoichiometric in holes and thus detracts part of the oxidant ArNu + H-1- + 2e- ArH + Nu~ (20) from acting in a catalytic fashion. Finally, one must acknowledge the fact that the oxidant sometimes can be depleted by oxidizing the nucleophile(s) (Nu~ and/or X\") present in the system (e.g. SO 4\"' vs. Cl~, reactions 4 and 8). It is therefore not surprising that the chain nature of an SoN2 reaction is obscured by these practical difficulties. The S^l reaction is actually in the same predicament, the initiator being often used in stoichiometric amount or even in excess. The persulfate-initiated hydrolyses (Nos. 4 and 8 of Table 1) ofchloro- and fluorobenzene are particularly interesting, at least from a principal point of view. They take place in neutral aqueous medium at room temperature and thus the reaction conditions differ vastly from those usually employed 33 (^350 C, 5 -10 M aqueous NaOH) to hydrolyze, for example, chloro- benzene. The catalytic effect can be approximately estimated to involve a factor of 105 in going from 5 M NaOH to water and a factor of 233 109 in going from 350 to 20 C, or combined, ca. 1014. This amounts to a lower- ing of the activation energy by ^20 kcal mol\"1. The Cu(III) initiated hydro- lysis of chloro- and fluoroaromatic compounds also proceeds under mild conditions (reflux in CF3COOH) and gives remarkably high yields of phenols. One can make here the reasonable assumption that protonation of the phenol formed to give ArOH;\"*\" protects it from further oxidation by the very strong oxidant, Cu(III) (E > 1.8 V*). Reaction 17, acetoxyl/chlorine exchange in chloroferrocene, was first believed to be an ideal case of SoN2 behaviour, but it soon appeared that chloroferricinium ion was completely unreactive toward acetate ion (i.e., the step of eqn. 16 failed) under the conditions used and even more strenuous ones [34]. The low reactivity is presumably due to the fact that the positive charge of chloroferricinium ions is localized on the metal to an extent that the ring positions are very weakly electrophilic. Reaction 18, again an expected next to ideal case, is hampered by the same effect: The positive charge of the radical cation is localized on the nitrogen atom, so that the ring position next to fluorine bears too little positive charge to be reactive enough toward the nucleophile. This radical cation was earlier described as relatively stable [35]. Reaction 9 was part of a very thorough investigation of the aryne mechanism of 4-chlorotoluene hydrolysis by sodium hydroxide at very high temperatures [29]. The presence of oxygen led to an immediate switch to an ipso substitution mechanism at a somewhat lower temperature; it is tempting to suggest that this is mediated by Cu(III), formed directly from oxygen and Cu(II) under the extreme conditions, in an SoN2-like reaction sequence. Reaction 15 is an intramolecular version (which should be denoted SoNi) of ths SoN2 reaction [31]. Attempts to cyclize 2-fluorophenylacetic acid failed, mainly due to the higher reactivity of COO\" relative to the 2-fluorophenyl moiety with respect to oxidation [34]. Only the C00~ group appears to be attacked, and the product is that of decarboxylation to give the benzylic radical, further oxidation and solvolysis (eqn. 21). ox e ArCHaCOO- > ArCH; ^ ArCHsOAc (21) CO 2 AcCr ETC catalyzed cycloadditions Cycloaddition reactions of the [2+2] type were shown to be catalyzed by electron transfer oxidants as early as 1965. Thus Ledwith and coworkers [37, 38] found that Fe(III) salts (nitrate, perchlorate, but not chloride) in *A11 potentials given in this paper are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode. 34 methanol at 25 C converted JV-vinylcarbazole into trans-l,2-dicarbazolyl- cyclobutane in principle a thermally forbidden process in a fast reaction and with a catalytic efficiency of>800% (eqn. 22). Fe(m) R = earbazolyl (22) Cerium(IV) complexes could also be used as catalysts. At about the same time, the same dimer had been isolated in low yield from the anodic oxida- tion of Jv-vinylcarbazole in acetonitrile [39], and its photosensitized cyclo- dimerization (quantum yield >1) was also realized [40]. More detailed studies demonstrated that 2,2'-bipyridyl in 3-fold excess over Fe(III) slowed down the reaction but increased the yield of the cyclo- butane [38]. A second dimeric compound (eqn. 23) was isolated and dem- onstrated to be a product of oxidative dimerization. This reaction type is well known from organic electrochemistry where it has some generality [41]. A few other aromatic enamines underwent similar reactions upon treatment with electron transfer oxidants, among which Ag(I) and Cu(II) could also be included [37b]. To complete the picture an organic electron transfer oxidant, tris(4-bromophenyl)ammomumyl (of the type ArsN'1\") could be used to oxidize JV-vinylcarbazole quantitatively to the oxidative dimerization product (eqn. 23) [42], whereas another type of radical cation, 2e > RCHCHsCH^CHR R earbazolyl (23) f CHaOH 11 S OMe OMe (perylene)\"*\", catalyzes the polymerization of JV-vinylcarbazole in nitro- methane, causing an 84% conversion to a polymer of molecular weight 210 000 [43]. Kinetic experiments [38] demonstrated that the rate of cyclodimeriza- tion was always six to seven times greater than the rate of formation of the reduced form of the catalyst, indicating the chain nature of the reaction (eqns. 24 - 26).

For all sensitizers 35 tried, the quantum yield was >1, and in fact as high as 14 with chloranil as sensitizer. The same mechanism as in eqns. 24 - 26 was inferred, the oxidizing agent being the singlet state of the sensitizer. Oxygen, being essential for cyclodimerization to occur, played the role of reoxidizing the sensitizer radical anion. Ferrocene (E0 = 0.55 V), a very easily oxidizable compound, acted as a strong retarder for the cyclodimerization by virtue of its great efficiency as fluorescence quencher toward iV-vinylcarbazole. Aromatic enamines are very easily oxidizable compounds and thus excellent model compounds for studying chain mechanisms. High reducing power is however not necessary for cyclodimerization to occur, since both indene ( 1,2 =1.77 V) and 1,1-dimethylindene ( 1/2=1.68 V) undergo electron transfer catalyzed cyclodimerization (photochemically or Fe(III) initiated) to give the anti-head-to-head dimer (eqn. 27) [44]. ox (27) Again compounds of lower oxidation potential (e.g., 1,2-dimethoxy- benzene, 1.57 V; 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, 1.36 V) than the substrate inhibited the formation of the cyclodimer. The same reaction could also be initiated anodically with 5,6-dimethoxy- and l-t-butyl-5,6-dimethoxy- indene ( 1/2 of both = 0.81 V) [45]. Indene dimers could be cleaved photo- chemically (quantum yield 8.2) via an ETC mechanism [46a]. Another [2+2] ETC cycloaddition process is the anodically and tris(4- bromophenyl)ammoniumyl-catalyzed addition of oxygen to the somewhat unusual olefin, adamantylideneadamantane, to give the corresponding oxetane. Chain lengths of up to 20 - 25 were reported [46b, c]. The electron transfer-induced cycloreversion of cyclobutanes has recently [47] been studied in some detail with the cage compound shown in eqn. 28. This reaction can be initiated at room temperature in the dark by weak electron transfer oxidants of the quinone type (p-chloranil, = 0.25 V; 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone, E0 = 0.1 V) if the aryl group is activated by a methoxy group ( 1/2 of cage compound is then 1.09 V) but not when Ar = Ph ( 1/2 of cage compound = 1.41 V). On irradiation in the presence of the above-mentioned sensitizers and a host of others, the diphenyl deriv- ative underwent cycloreversion in quantitative substance yield and very Ar. , Ar\\ ^ ^- ^ (28) high quantum yields. Added good electron donors, such as triethylamine ( 1/2 = 0.82 V) quenched the reactions completely, in agreement with a radical cation chain mechanism similar to that in eqns. 24 - 26. The Diels-Alder reaction ([2+4] cycloaddition) is also subject to electron transfer catalysis, as was suggested around 1970 on the basis of a 36 radiation chemical study of the dimerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene [48]. This phenomenon has recently been developed for synthetic purposes by Bauld et al. [49 - 51]. To take 1,3-cyclohexadiene as an example, its thermal [2 + 4] dimerization (eqn. 29) proceeds in 30% yield at 200 C for 20 h. ^ Ar3Nt . fS^h) I^J CH,C1, ^^U o c exo (29) In contrast, the reaction gives a 70% yield after 15 min in dichloromethane at 0 C in the presence of catalytic amounts (3 - 5%) of tris(4-bromophenyl)- ammoniumyi hexachloroantimonate, the endo/exo selectivity being slightly greater than that observed in the uncatalyzed reaction (5:1 us. 4:1). This catalytic effect, representing a lowering of the transition state energy by 10-11 kcal mol\"1, is most clearly visible for sterically hindered dienes, such as 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene (eqn. 30); this reaction has no thermal (30) counterpart. The suprafacial stereospecificity, so synthetically useful and characteristic of the uncatalyzed Diels-Alder reaction, was retained in the radical cation-catalyzed version and actually turned out to be somewhat better. From the detailed analysis of these results, it was concluded that the catalyzed reaction must be described as the symmetry-allowed reaction between the dienophile (DP) radical cation and the diene (D), i.e., as a [4+1] cycloaddition, rather than the forbidden [3+2] cycloaddition of dienophile and diene radical cation. Thus the chain reaction was depicted asineqns. 31 -33 [50] DP + Ar3N+ > Ax^N + DP-\" DP'\" + D A\"\" A-\" + DP > A + DP-\" (31) (32) (33) A recent report has dealt with the photosensitized (by 9,10-dicyano- anthracene) version of eqn. 29 which gives the cycloaddition products in good yield and represents a useful synthetic technique for obtaining Diels- Alder adducts from electron-rich dienes and olefins [52]. In principle, many types of pericyclic processes should be subject to catalysis by redox reagents, especially oxidants, but very little is known about these possibilities. From the cases discussed above, this area should be a very promising one for the development of new synthetic methods. The photosensitized [4+4] cycloreversion of the anthracene dimer (eqn. 34) in a limiting quantum yield of 0.75 was recently described [53], and no doubt many other examples will be revealed in the future. 37 (34) ETC catalyzed decomposition of diazoalkanes The decomposition of aliphatic diazo compounds to give alkenes (eqn. 35) is efficiently catalyzed by electron transfer oxidants [32] or by ox 2R2C=N=N > R^C=CR^ + 2N; (35) the anode [54]. The reaction actually represents a formal change of the oxidation state of the carbon atom originally bonded to nitrogen, but in essence the reaction is of the ETC type just as, e.g., the SoN2-like photo- chemically or anodically stimulated replacement of fluorine by cyano in 4-fluoroanisole (see Table 1). A mechanistic study in acetonitrile showed that diphenyldiazomethane ( '1/2= 1.19 V) is decomposed by copper(II) perchlorate (oxidation potential around 1.0 V) or tris(4-bromophenyl)- ammoniumyi perchlorate ( 1/2 = 1.28 V) to give predominantly tetraphenyl- ethylene (.E?i/2=1.56 V) and small or trace amounts of benzophenone azine (- '1/2 = 1.92 V) and trace amounts of products resulting from reactions with residual water (diphenylmethanol, benzophenone, and benzpinacol). There was practically no difference between the two initiators, and the catalytic efficiency was very high in both cases, 5 000 -10 000%. The reac- tion was first order in oxidant and diazo compound. The suggested mechanism (eqns. 36, 37) is formally identical to the R2C=N=N (36) + R2C NN . + R2C-NN 2' R2C-N=N + R2C=N=N > \\ . + N N- II CRi R2C-N=N RiC CRi R2C=N-N=CR2 (37) ]RiCN2 R2C==CR2 + R2C=N-N=CR2 + R2CN2\" 38 SoN2 mechanism (eqns. 15 -18). The radical cation of PhaCN^ attacks a parent molecule in the rate-determining step either at the diazo carbon (leading to the alkene) or the terminal nitrogen atom (leading to the azine), as shown in eqn. 37. One should note that eqns. 36 and 37 seemingly repre- sent a thermodynamically uphill process, if we only look at the change in oxi- dation potential in going from substrate to product (maximally 1.92 1.19 = 0.73 V = 17 kcal mol\"1 in the case of the azine of eqn. 37). Of course this is not so; the overall reaction is strongly exothermic (for R = H the forma- tion of the alkene + nitrogen from two molecules of substrate is exothermic by ca. 125 kcal mol~1) due to the high thermodynamic stability of molecular nitrogen, and this is more than enough to produce what is formally a higher energy species as a result of eqns. 36 and 37. ETC catalyzed reactions of small rings Small ring species, being highly strained and easily oxidizable [55], are expected to be susceptible to ETC catalysis under suitable conditions. Two such cases have been reported recently by Simonet et al. [56, 57], the tetramerization of JV-benzylaziridine by the anode, tris(4-bromophenyl)- ammoniumyi, or thianthrene radical cation (eqn. 38), and isomerization of epoxides to ketones by the anode (eqn. 39). In both cases a chain reaction R C^ ^^^r ^ ^ (38) ^-N-^ , ox , , RaC -CR; > RiR'CCOR' (39) ^Or > 1000% was postulated, initiated by formation of the substrate radical cation. For eqn. 38, the chain reaction steps shown in eqns. 40 - 43 were invoked (S = substrate, S' = ring-opened substrate, T = tetramer). The alternative mechanism, that anodically generated ti+ catalyzes the tetramerization process, as suggested for e.g., the anodic ring-opening of N-acetylaziridine (eqn. 44) [58], was ruled out by the far greater catalytic power of the S ^ S-\" (40) S-\" > (SV OQ (SV ^ (SV > T^ (41) (42) T\"1\" +S ^T+S\"1\" 39 (43) A ox CH3CON > CH3CONHCH2CH20CH3 (44) N CHaOH anode (room temperature in methanol or dichloromethane) as compared to homogeneous proton catalysis (reflux for several h in ethanol) and the fact that radical cations could be used as initiators in indirect electrochemical procedures. ETC catalyzed rotation around bonds and ligand exchange An intriguing suggestion of electron transfer promotion of rotation around double bonds in acetone hydrazones was made a few years ago [59] (eqn. 45). The reaction rate was strongly influenced by the addition of R2 R2 R^ CCl< ^^R1 I I (45) A ^ ?3 CH3 CH, CH3 polyhalogenated compounds (CCl4, CBr4), and this was interpreted in terms of a radical cation isomerization mechanism (eqn. 46, S = substrate. S\" = rotamer of substrate). S + CCl4 ^=i S^ + CCl4- ?= S\" + CCl4 (46) This mechanism is however not compatible with the Marcus theory since the oxidizing power of a polyhalogenated compound, although a reasonably good electron transfer oxidant in other contexts [60], is too low to allow for the 'stoichiometric' use in the oxidation of an acetone hydrazone (E0 values can be estimated to be ca. 0 and at least 1.2 V, re- spectively). On the other hand, if a chain mechanism is assumed, this obstacle can be removed if the chain is long enough. Although presently almost entirely speculative, the possibility of an ETC mechanism for rotation around double bonds should be easily tested by looking at the effect of chain-terminating additives, other types of initiators, etc. Finally, in our list of established or suggested ETC mechanisms it should be remembered that this concept is not limited to organic reactions but can be equally well applied to organometallic and inorganic ones, such as ligand exchange reactions, on which excellent reviews are available [3a, b]. A recent and well-corroborated example is the electrocatalytic (anodical- ly) substitution of carbonylmetal complexes, such as the tungsten complex of eqn. 47 [61]. This complex is stable to substitution by triphenylphos- phine at 25 C. It was proposed and experimentally verified that the 40 anode at cis(MeCN)2W(CO)4 + Ph3P > cis(MeCN)(Ph3P)W(CO)4 + MeCN 0.2Vus.SCE Isolated yield ca. 100% (47) Catalytic efficiency ca. 2000% anodically produced radical cation undergoes very fast ligand substitution and the new radical cation then transfers the hole to a new substrate mole- cule. Theoretical treatment of ETC reactions Since we are dealing with chain reactions, certain general requirements must be met for an ETC reaction to be feasible. Firstly, all steps, except possibly the initiating redox reaction, must be very fast to allow for long reaction chains to build up [62]. This means that the overall reaction cannot be endothermic but should preferably be exothermic (unless it can be run with a large excess of reagent under equilibrium conditions, such as the Sogi reaction; eqns. 11 -14). Heats of reaction for models of the reaction discussed above are given in Table 2. It should be noted that these model reactions presumably represent extremes of exothermicity and that sub- stituents will decrease heats of reaction considerably but not to the extent that the reactions become endothermic. With this reservation in mind, we still find that most of the reactions discussed above should be exothermic and thus fulfill the first criterion for sustaining a chain reaction. Next the individual steps will have to be considered in some detail. The initiating step need not necessarily be fast, even if in practice it often is. The non-bonded electron transfer between two species is governed by the Marcus theory [67-71] which views the reactants as two spheres (of radii ri and r;) immersed in a continuous dielectric of dielectric constant D. The two spheres diffuse together (rate constant k^) and form an encoun- ter complex with a distance between the two electron exchange centers of ri + r;. The transition state is reached from the encounter complex by bond reorganization in the reactants (with bond reorganization energy = \\i) and solvent reorganization around them (with solvent reorganization energy = \\o) s0 as to make the energy levels of the exchanging electron in each reactant match each other exactly. This is a consequence of the Franck-Condon principle which in essence tells us that transfer of an electron between two species takes place much faster than any change in the nuclear coordinates. If it is assumed that no reorganization takes place and the electron then were to be transferred between unperturbed reactants, a perpetuum mobile of the first kind would in principle be feasible, and hence we see the need for this formulation of the electron transfer transition state. The total reorganization energy X = \\ + Ao can either be estimated from extrakinetic parameters or determined experimentally. It is one consequence 41 TABLE 2 Heats of reaction of model ETC processes8 Reaction type1' Model reaction (solvent or phase) AH\" (kcal mol~1) ^Nl PhBr + SH- > PhSH + Br~ (H^O) 18 SRNI PhBr + NH,- > PhNH, + Br- (H^O)' <-40 SONS PhF + H^O > PhOH + HF (H^O) 14 SONS PhCl + HiO PhOH + HC1 (H^O) 14 SoN2-like 2CH2=N=N > CH2=CH2 + 2N, (gas) -130 [2+ 2] CA 2CH2=CH2 > cyclo-C4Hg (gas) -18 [4 + 2] CA C-i O -38 [4+ 2] CA 2 1,3-cyclohexadiene > dicyclohexadiene (liq) 29 rearrangement of epoxides 3'^C7 CH^OC^tgas) 29 oligomerization of aziridines ^2v y <-40 H h ^hermodynamic data were obtained from standard tables and textbooks [63 - 66].

Armed with these definitions and concepts, we are ready to write down the Marcus' expression of feei, the observed rate constant for non- bonded electron transfer between two species, using the simple kinetic model introduced above (eqn. 52), where AG ' is the standard free energy ^d (52) change of the reaction under the actual conditions of solvent, temperature, etc., corrected by a term (AGc) to take account of the electrostatic effect of transferring the electron in the transition state (this term is calculated by a simple Coulomb expression, see eqn. 53; sometimes it is necessary AGe = 331.2ZiZ^/D(ri + r^) (53) 43 to multiply by a factor involving the ionic strength of the medium (Z^ and ZT, are the charges of the reactants)). In logarithmic form, this equation generates a parabola, the shape and maximum of which is determined by the value of X. A greater X moves the maximum toward lower AG ' and flattens the parabola. We can now proceed to scrutinize an example of an initiation step of a typical ETC reaction, and choose the SoN2 reaction of eqn. 19, initiated by the 12-tungstocobalt(III)ate ion (E = 1.00 V), for this purpose [21]. The reaction takes place in acetic acid/0.5 M KOAc at ca. 110 C. 4-Meth- oxyfluorobenzene has an E value of 2.10 V which means that AG for the initial ET step is 23.06(1.0 2.1) = 25.4 kcal mol\"1. In principle, this value should be corrected by an electrostatic term, but in practice and especially in the particular example at hand (low dielec- tric constant, high ionic charge) this involves a rather delicate and difficult matter of judgement. If we assume that ri + r; in the transition state is 8 A and use D = 6.2 for acetic acid, eqn. 53 gives AGc = 6 X 331.2/6.2/8 = 40 kcal mol\"1 for a situation in which Z\\Z^ changes from (0) X ( 5) = 0 to (+1)X( 6)= 6 upon transfer of the electron. But we now have neglected to multiply AGc by the factor expressing the effect of ionic strength Qa) = lo-^21-9^-1-r^ VM/OT) referred to above, and the difficulty lies in estimating this factor. Acetic acid is a low-dielectric constant medium and it is not possible to give any reliable estimate of JU. In the absence of other information, we shall assume that this factor is 0.1 (corresponding to p. being 0.075 in this case) thus reducing AGc to 4 kcal mol\"1. AG ' is then 25.4 - 4.0 = 21.4 kcal mol-1. Next we need an estimate of A for the ET step. For the 12-tungsto- cobalt^I^ate5\"^6- self-exchange reaction X is known to be ca. 25 kcal mol\"1 under slightly different conditions [72], and that of 4-methoxy- fluorobenzene can be estimated from X values of analogous compounds (see Table 3) to be 12 kcal mol~1. This gives X for the reaction under study = 0.5(12 + 25) = 18.5 kcal mol~1, and feel can then be calculated from eqn. 52 to be 2.6 X 10~2 M~1 s~1, a rate constant fully compatible with experi- mental findings. The above example illustrates well the difficulties and uncertainties involved in applying the Marcus treatment to real organic systems in solvents of low D. Nevertheless, it is currently the best simple approach that we have available, and with further experimentation the unknown factors should easily be brought under control. Table 4 gives a selection of examples of estimated rate constants for the initiation steps of different types of ETC reactions. Due to the uncertainties involved in finding accurate AG ' values in most of the solvents employed, these rate constants should be viewed with great care. We do note, however, that some reactions seem to have extremely slow initiation steps, and it is of interest to discuss if they are indeed feasible at all. The first reaction, the Sy,yil reaction of iodobenzene with pinacolone enolate ion [73], is one of the few S^l reactions that can be run without ^ 01 ^ CO 00 \" 0 C. -^ '-1 0 '\"''\"' 0 1 XX T-f X X r-1 ^ W t0 ^] X <N r-1 X A S. r-i (N r-1 '^ T-I i-i 00 0 to ^1 co ^' o >n <N U oo i-i o LO <f M co < N IN i-l <-) N 1 <N IN 01 /< + LO 10 LO LO ^ o oo oo co IN ro co ^1 1-< IN W r-1 l-l CO 01 0 \"3 ^) t^ N CO t^ ^.

The nature of the initiation step was assumed to be ET between the enolate ion and iodobenzene, and now we can see that this leads to a calculated ET rate constant which is very small and would require extremely long chains to be compatible with the observed rates (and this is of course a prediction that can be checked exper- imentally). A snag is the uncertainty of the E value of the carbanion; here the oxidation potential ( 0.2 V) of benzyl methyl ketone enolate ion was used as the closest analogy [74]. The relation of this oxidation potential to the E value is not known, except that it is probable that it contains a term involving overpotential. Hence E could be > 0.2 V and the predicted rate constant even smaller. Another estimated, very slow initiation step is the ET reaction between 1,3-cyclohexadiene and tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl [49]. The same source of uncertainty as above applies to the oxidation potential of 1,3- cyclohexadiene, in that its E value probably is lower than the experimental '1/2 value (2.34 V) due to an overpotential term. In this case, such a correc- tion would lead to a larger predicted ET rate constant. Still, this reaction is one in which to look for experimental evidence for unusually long reaction chains. The last reaction of Table 4, decreased rotational barriers around bonds in acetone hydrazones in the presence of polyhalides, is a curious and interesting one [59]. The oxidation potentials of aliphatic hydrazones are known for 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones only [75] and lie in the region between 1.5 and 1.6 V, and that of acetone hydrazones can be estimated to be slightly lower, 1.2 V. The E of CBr4/CBr3'Br~ was put equal to that of CC14/CC13'Cl~ [60], but this is an uncertain assumption. It may be that this E value is greater, and then the predicted ET rate constant will increase. This reaction should be amenable to several types of experimental tests, e.g., by looking for possibly strong inhibition by added nucleophiles (which would intercept the radical cation and thus break the chain). The second step of any of the ETC reactions discussed is the crucial one, and involves a dissociative (SR^I. SOE^I small ring cleavage) or associa- tive (SoN2 or CA) reaction. It is thus determined entirely by the reactivity of the particular radical ion formed in the initiation step, and the theoretical problems involved at this stage of an ETC process are part of a far larger problem area, namely that of radical ion reactivity in general [76-79]. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the rules of radical ion behaviour is limited, and the controversies presently raging around these problems [80, 81] indicate that they will not be easily resolved because of the high degree of complexity of radical ion processes [30]. However, for the purpose at hand it will suffice to ascertain that radical ion reactions normally are extremely facile, an important require- ment for a step in a radical chain reaction. Quantitatively, it is to be ex- pected that radical ions should be very reactive, firstly because of their charge which strongly enhances nucleophilicity (basicity) or electrophilicity (formation of a radical ion from a neutral molecule is the simplest act of 46 Umpolung [82] imaginable!), secondly because of the well-known property of odd-electron species to possess considerably weaker bonds than their parent closed-shell compounds. To take two examples of bond weakening, the enthalpy of cleavage of the a C H bond of toluene in the gas phase decreases by 28 kcal mol\"1 (eqns. 52 and 53) by removal of an electron, and the barrier of rotation around the C^C bond in stilbene decreases by ca. 25 kcal moF1 upon addition of an electron [83]. An even more drastic effect is seen in the pK difference between toluene and (toluene)\"1\", esti- mated to be >60 p.K\"a units [79] in acetonitrile solution! PhCH3 ^PhCH;' + H' (52) PhCHa4\" > PhCH/ + H-' (53) Table 5 shows selected examples of rate constants for actual or model cases of the second dissociative/associative step of certain ETC reactions. Few of the rate constants of the second step of authentic ETC pro- cesses are known, except for the SRNI variety where the second step, cleavage of aryl halide radical anions, has been subjected to a few kinetic studies [84-87]. We therefore have to rely on model systems. Because of the scarcity of rate data for the reaction between simple monocyclic aromat- ic radical cations and nucleophiles (they are extremely fast and thus difficult to measure) the radical cations of perylene and 9,10-diphenylanthracene have been quoted as models for such reactions. We then can be sure that the corresponding reactions of monocyclic compounds are much faster than those of these two relatively stable radical cations. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find any reported kinetic results for models of olefin radical cation/neutral molecule reactions (the second step of cycloaddition pro- cesses). The second step of the SoN2 reaction, attack at the ipso position of an aryl halide radical cation, is expected to be an extremely fast process, as judged by the model rate constants for nuclear attack of nucleophiles upon aromatic radical cations (Table 5). Also estimates based on a previously published thermochemical method (which in essence predicts that radical cation reactivity is determined mainly by the relative oxidation potentials of the parent molecule of the radical cation and the nucleophile) leads to the same conclusion [76]. It is, however, important to note that we here run into a fundamental problem of radical ion reactivity in particular and organic chemistry in general, namely that competition between two types of elementary processes becomes possible (for examples, see Table 5). Apart from forming a covalent bond to the nucleophile, the radical cation can oxidize it in an electron transfer step (eqns. 54 and 55), a dichotomy in- herent in all situations where a donor (D) and acceptor (A) species can interact, irrespective of charge and oxidation state (eqns. 56 and 57) [71].

However, 48 for less strongly endergonic and sometimes even exergonic reactions (in the electron transfer sense) this distinction becomes blurred, and we need only consider two cases in Table 5 to realize that there is an interesting reactivity problem hidden here: Why does DPA\"1\" react with Br~ with electron transfer (AG for ET = 6.2 kcal mol\"1) whereas (isodurene)\"1\" reacts with HO\" to form a C OH bond (AG for ET < 10 kcal mol\"1)? There are presently no ready answers to this and many other similar questions, so the whole problem of dual radical ion reactivity should be a fertile area for theoretical and experimental studies. The third step of an ETC mechanism (eqns. 8, 17, 25, 32) brings the system back to the radical ion level; in the forward direction a new radical ion appears whereas trivially in the reverse direction the starting species are obtained back. For these elementary processes we have even fewer quantitative data, the SRNI reaction again being the most and now only - studied case. Table 6 gives rate constants for some Ar' and Nu~ pairs, and it is seen that they are all in the very fast range of 107 -109 M~1 s~1 [91, 92]. For the SoN2 mechanism no quantitative data for the third step are available, but a qualitative insight was obtained by a thermochemical estimate of the relative rates of the two competing reactions (eqn. 58) in the case of acetoxylation of fluorobenzene and 4-methoxyfluorobenzene PhF-\" + AcO- > Ph(F)OAc > (PhOAc)^ + F- (58) [18]. These calculations showed that the loss of fluoride from the fluoro- acetoxycyclohexadienyl radical should be favoured over that of acetate ion by about 10 kcal moF1. With the introduction of a substituent which makes the starting fluoride easier to oxidize (e.g., 4-methoxy), the rate of loss of the leaving ion should increase, still with F~ strongly preferred over AcCT. That this prediction cannot be pursued in the extreme is clearly shown by the lack of SQN^ reactivity exhibited by chloroferrocene and 4-fluoro-N,iV-dimethylaniline (see above). Qualitatively, the predicted behaviour of chloride ion as a leaving group relative to acetate ion is anal- ogous. The third step of an ETC cycloaddition reaction, intramolecular reac- tion between a carbonium ion centre and a radical (eqn. 59) is identical to R\" + R-\" > (R-R)^ (59) the SRNI third step (eqn. 8), except for the difference in charge type. To the author's knowledge, no solution rate data are known for this kind of reaction, but there is no reason to assume that it should be slower than its anionic counterpart. After the third step, the new radical ion must fulfill a final requirement in that it must be capable of oxidizing/reducing a molecule of the starting material in a fast step in order to obtain efficient chain transfer. Generally, this should present no serious problem, since one safely can tolerate a difference in E value of <0.3 V in the endergonic sense without encounter- ing unreasonably low rates for the chain transfer step.

Since the substrate generally is present in high concentration, the chain transfer step should be a very fast one. Moreover, the nature of the new radical ion often is such as to produce a stronger oxidant/reductant than the initiating species, implying diffusion-controlled rate constants for the chain transfer step. Table 7 lists examples of chain transfer reactions and their energetics; they are all weakly endergonic, thermoneutral or exergonic, except for one case, PhF/(PhOH)\"1\". This reaction is far too endergonic to be a feasible chain transfer step and hence we must either surmise a different, more strongly oxidizing intermediate, such as (PhOti)^', or a different type of mechanism.

To take an example, the R' intermediate in the SR^I mechanism (eqn. 7) should readily enter into radical reactions with the solvent (SH), e.g., hydrogen atom abstraction [94], and the newly formed radical S' would then not be productive in the SRN^ sense. In the SoN2 mechanism a likely termination process is the irreversible electron transfer oxidation of the nucleophile competing with the chain transfer step, e.g., the radical cation oxidizing acetate ion to carbon dioxide and methyl radical. Generally, the high redox reactivity of radical ions allows for deplorably efficient termination pathways. References 1 For reviews on radical anions, see for example (a) M.

If an electron is added to or removed from a neutral molecule, a radical anion (cation) is formed (eqn. i), and can undergo reactions at the new oxidation level (eqn. ii). At a later stage of the reaction sequence, a return to the original oxidation level can be achieved by a chain transfer step, i.e., a chemically different radical anion (cation) can reduce (oxidize) a new molecule of the starting material (eqn. iii). A familiar example of this reaction type is the SRN1 reaction (developed and studied by Bunnett, Kornblum, Russell and Saveant in 1965–1980) which enables otherwise extremely slow aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions to take place under mild conditions. Other examples, to be discussed in this paper, include the SOE1 and SON2 reactions, cyclodimerizations and cycloreversions, cycloadditions in general, rearrangements, oligomerizations and ligand exchange reactions. In general, catalytic effects of the order of 10–20 k cal mol can be attained by electron transfer catalysis. References 1 (a) For reviews on radical anions, see for example M.
