The catalytic activity of a trinuclear Ru complex; ([(NH3)5Ru-O-Ru(NH3)4-O-Ru(NH3)5]6+) (Ru-red) for water oxidation was investigated both in a homogeneous aqueous solution system (AS) and a heterogeneous montmorillonite adsorbed system (clay). It was shown that water oxidation by the catalyst in the clay to evolve O2 is a competitive reaction with bimolecular decomposition of the catalyst. The bimolecular decomposition was remarkably suppressed in the clay as compared with the aqueous solution, and the catalytic activity was maintained under higher concentration conditions. This was ascribed to the immobilization and isolation of the complex in the clay. The catalytic activity was analyzed by a model equation based on intermolecular distance distribution of the complex. The catalytic activity (k O2 ) and the critical decomposition distance (r d) were obtained as 1.7×10−2 s−1 and 2.39 nm, respectively. Keywords Water oxidation Ru-red Clay 1 Introduction Utilization of a functional molecule in a heterogeneous matrix such as polymer membranes [1,2], ion-exchange resins [3–5], cellulose [6] and intercalation compounds [7] is recently receiving much attention in relation to its application to electric and photoelectric functional devices. It is important to optimize the function of the molecule in such systems. In our previous reports [8–10], it was found that a water oxidation catalyst is remarkably stabilized in a heterogeneous Nafion polymer membrane. Water oxidation is the most fundamental and important process toward construction of an artificial photosynthetic system in relevant to solar energy conversion and storage to create a new energy resource [2]. In order to construct an active and stable water oxidation catalyst, utilization of a heterogeneous phase is crucial. We have utilized heterogeneous Nafion membrane incorporating active water oxidation catalyst such as [(NH3)5Ru-O-Ru(NH3)4-O-Ru(NH3)5]6+ (Ru-red) [2,8], [(NH3)5Ru-O-Ru(NH3)5]4+ [9] and [Ru(NH3)5Cl]2+ [10,11]. These ruthenium complexes undergo bimolecular decomposition due to diffusion and collision at high concentration conditions in an aqueous solution. Such catalyst can be stabilized by immobilization in a polymer membrane [2,8–11]. In a Nafion membrane system where cationic complex is electrostatically attached to the anionic sulfonate groups, the ruthenium complex was almost immobilized in the matrix. Consequently, the bimolecular decomposition was remarkably suppressed in the membrane and catalytic activity was maintained even under high concentration conditions. In the present paper, the effect of immobilization and catalytic activity of Ru-red in a clay (montmorillonite; abbreviated to clay) were investigated. Cation exchange occurring between the inorganic layers and the substrates depends on the size of the exchanged cation [12]. The interlayer space is separated by the inorganic layer, so that it is expected that the interaction between the adsorbed substrates is minimum. In the present clay system, catalytic activity analysis will be carried out by a model equation based on intermolecular distance distribution. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Ru-red and cerium (IV) diammonium nitrate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Clay was purchased from Kunimine Ind. The reagents were used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of clay adsorbing Ru-red A mixture of Ru-red and clay (0.2 g) in water was vigorously stirred for ca. 5 h. The amount of the adsorbed complex was estimated from the absorption spectral change of Ru-red (532 nm) in the solution before and after adsorption of the complex into clay. The clay was centrifuged after adsorption and washed repeatedly by distilled water. The volume of clay was estimated using its density value of 4.0×10−4 dm3 g−1 2.3 Measurement of oxygen evolved Excess Ce(IV) diammonium nitrate powder was added as oxidant quickly into water containing suspended clay which adsorbed the catalyst. The atmosphere in the reaction vessel was replaced with argon gas before adding the Ce(IV) oxidant. For all the experiments, the vessel was kept at 25°C in the dark by cutting off the ambient light. The O2 evolved was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a 5-Å molecular sieve column using argon carrier gas (flow rate is 40 ml min −1) at 50°C. The amount of the O2 evolved was calculated by subtracting the amount of O2 detected for blank experiment without the complex. 3 Results and discussion It is well-known that clay markedly swells in water. The interlayer spacing of clay is ca. 0.66 nm under dry conditions and expands to ca. 1.25 nm under swollen conditions [13]. The clay has an interesting inorganic layer structure assembled by SiO4 tetrahedral and AlO6 octahedral sheets. Since the size of Ru-red (a kind of cylinder with 0.75 nm diameter and 1.40 nm length) is smaller than the size between the layers, the complex can be adsorbed among the layers. Cationic complexes are adsorbed into the space (called as exchangeable space) between the inorganic layers by cationic exchange. Chemical catalytic water oxidation using oxidant consists of two steps. In the first step, the catalyst is oxidized by oxidant to a high oxidation state as shown by Eq. (1). In the second step, two water molecules were oxidized by the high oxidation state catalyst to evolve oxygen as shown by Eq. (2): (1) 4Ce IV +(catalyst) red → k ox 4Ce III +(catalyst) ox (2) (catalyst) ox +2H 2 O → k O 2 (catalyst) red +O 2 +4H + where k ox and k O2 represent the reaction rate constants of Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. Fig. 1 shows a typical time dependence of oxygen evolved by the Ru-red in a heterogeneous clay under the excess Ce (IV) oxidant. The O2 evolved increased almost linearly with time at the initial stage (up to 20 min). The O2 evolution rate (V O2 (mol s−1)) was obtained from the initial slope. The oxygen evolution stopped after ca. 2 h. This saturation is considered to be due to inactivation by bimolecular decomposition between the adjacent catalysts as reported previously [8] because a large excess of the Ce(IV) oxidant remained even after 2 h. The plot of the initial oxygen evolution rate (V O2 ) vs. the Ce(IV) concentration for the clay system is shown in Fig. 2 . Under low concentration the V O2 value is first-order with respect to the cerium concentration, showing that oxygen evolution can be treated as a pseudo-first-order rate vs. Ce(IV) concentration. The V O2 value is saturated beyond the molar ratio of Ce(IV)/Ru-red (=900, at 4.0×10−2 M Ce(IV)). All the experiments were conducted beyond this cerium concentration where V O2 is independent of the Ce(IV) concentration. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the V O2 and catalyst concentration in clay. The V O2 value increased linearly with the increase of the Ru-red concentration at low concentration conditions as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. This linear relationship shows that the water oxidation reaction by Ru-red can be treated as a pseudo-first-order process with respect to the Ru-red concentration. The first-order rate constant of O2 evolution was estimated as 1.7×10−2 s−1 from the slope of the straight line in the inset of Fig. 3. However, under high concentration conditions, the V O2 value decreased with the increase of the Ru-red concentration, showing that a bimolecular decomposition takes place between adjacent complexes. We have reported [8] that the catalytic activity of Ru-red at high concentrations in an aqueous solution system (AS) decreased drastically by oxidation of the ammine ligands evolving N2 as shown in Eq. (3). (3) 2(catalyst) ox → k deact deactivation This k deact represents the second-order rate constant of the bimolecular decomposition. In the present heterogeneous clay, the bimolecular decomposition also should take place between the complexes; however, no N2 was detected because of the small amount of the catalyst. In order to compare the catalyses for the AS and heterogeneous clay, the apparent catalytic activity (k app (s−1)) is defined as (4) k app =V O 2 /m Ru where m Ru represents the amount of the catalyst present. The relationship between k app and the Ru-red concentration in AS and clay is shown in Fig. 4 . The k app value in the AS decreased drastically with the increase of the Ru-red concentration. However, it was maintained even at high concentrations in the clay. This shows that the bimolecular decomposition was inhibited by immobilization of the cationic complex in the clay, and that the complexes adsorbed in different interlayer spaces are isolated to suppress the bimolecular decomposition. The water oxidation by a high oxidation state catalyst would compete with a second-order bimolecular decomposition between the catalysts. Based on this, k app is represented by Eq. (5). (5) k app =k O 2 Φ O 2 where Φ O2 is the yield of the O2 evolution defined by the following equation: (6) Φ O 2 =k O 2 [catalyst]/(k O 2 [catalyst]+k deact [catalyst]2) where k deact (M−1 s−1) is a second-order rate constant for the inactivation by the bimolecular decomposition in Eq. (3), and [catalyst] represents the Ru-red concentration in clay. Eq. (7) is given from Eqs. (5) and (6). (7) k app −1=1/k O 2 +(k deact /k O 2 2)[catalyst] The plots of k app −1 vs. the Ru-red concentration for clay are shown in Fig. 5 . Since these plots almost fall on a straight line in accord with Eq. (7), it is reasonable that the catalytic first-order O2 evolution is a competitive reaction with the second-order bimolecular decomposition. The values of k O2 and k deact in clay were obtained from the intercept and the slope of the straight line as 1.7×10−2 s−1 and 1.2 M−1 s−1, respectively. The k O2 and k deact values in AS and clay are listed in Table 1 . The k O2 value thus obtained agreed with that obtained from the slope in the inset of Fig. 3. This shows that Eq. (7) based on the kinetic treatment is reasonable, and that the water oxidation can be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to the Ru-red concentration. Although the catalytic activity in clay is one third of that in AS, it is noteworthy that the k deact value in clay is suppressed by 400 times as in AS, indicating that the inorganic layer structure is advantageous to construct a stable water oxidation catalyst system. In the clay where the cationic complex is electrostatically attached to the exchangeable site, the complex would be almost fixed, and a free diffusion of the complex would be prohibited. The catalysis and the bimolecular decomposition could, therefore, be analyzed by a static mechanism rather than a dynamic one that involves diffusion and collision of the complex. In our previous studies, a catalytic activity analysis based on the static mechanism considering intermolecular distance distribution was carried out [8–10]. The intermolecular distance between the molecules dispersed into such a heterogeneous matrix has a distribution depending on their concentration (Fig. 6) . The probability density (P(r) (nm−1)) of the nearest neighbor intermolecular distance (r (nm), center-to-center distance) of the catalyst molecule can be represented by Eq. (8) [8,14–19]; (8) P(r)=4πr2N A αc×10−24 exp[−4π(r3−s3)N A αc×10−24/3] where N A (mol−1) and c (mol dm−3) are Avogadro's number and apparent average complex concentration in the clay, respectively; s represents the contact distance between the complexes. The s value was obtained as 1.06 nm from a diameter of a sphere that has the same volume as the Ru-red molecular volume [8]. α represents the degree of localization of the complex in the clay [18]. When the complex is localized in the interlayer region of the clay, the α value is necessary to calculate the real local complex concentration in the clay. For the clay, the Ru-red is adsorbed into only interlayer space. The α value in the clay was obtained from the volume fraction of the interlayer space in the clay. The thickness of the inorganic layer is ca. 0.66 nm, and the thickness of the interlayer space expands to ca. 1.25 nm under the conditions of the present experiment. Therefore, the α value in the clay system was estimated as 1.53. Fig. 5 shows intermolecular distance distribution for various Ru-red concentrations according to Eq. (8). Assuming that the catalysts existing within a critical decomposition distance r d (nm) undergo a bimolecular decomposition to deactivate, the fraction (R dec) of the decomposing catalyst is expressed as follows; (9) R dec = ∫ s r d P(r)dr. The fraction of the effective catalyst for water oxidation is represented by 1−R dec as Eq. (10). (10) 1−R dec =1− ∫ s r d P(r)dr=exp{−4π(r d 3−s3)αcN A ×10−24/3} The k app should be proportional to 1−R dec, so that it can be expressed as follows; (11) k app =k(1−R dec ) where k is a constant to represent the intrinsic activity of the catalyst without bimolecular decomposition. Eq. (12) can be derived from Eqs. (10) and (11). (12) k app =k exp{−4π(r d 3−s3)αcN A ×10−24/3} Eq. (12) was applied to the plots of Fig. 4 for the clay using a nonlinear least-square method, and the best fitting was obtained when the k and r d value were 1.7×10−2 s−1 and 2.39 nm, respectively. The k value is the same as the k O2 (1.7×10−2 s−1) value that was obtained from the intercept of the straight line in Fig. 3 according to Eq. (7). The r d value is much larger than the molecular size of the Ru-red (1.06 nm), suggesting that the bimolecular decomposition can occur only by diffusion of the complex in the interlayer space. In order to construct a stable catalyst system, the immobilization of the catalyst in the clay was thus very effective. 4 Conclusion Chemical catalytic water oxidation by Ru-red adsorbed into a clay was studied using Ce(IV) oxidant. The activity analysis was carried out by model equations considering kinetics and an intermolecular distance distribution. As the result, the first-order rate constant of water oxidation (k O2 ) and the second-order bimolecular decomposition rate constant (k deact) as well as a critical decomposition distance (r d (nm)) were obtained. It was shown that the deactivation rate constant k deact in the clay decreased remarkably as compared with that in an AS, indicating that the bimolecular decomposition was suppressed to a great extent in the clay due to isolation and immobilization of the complexes by the inorganic layer. The decomposition distance r d was estimated as 2.39 nm. In order to construct a stable and an active artificial water oxidation catalyst system, it is very effective to use a heterogeneous clay matrix to immobilize the catalyst.
