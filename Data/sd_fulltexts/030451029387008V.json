(+42-7)495381 (Received October 7,1992; accepted February 16,1993) Abstract A variety of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanols were oxidized in the aqueous phase, both individually and competitively in pairs, over a carbon-supported palladium catalyst, or the same catalyst modified by Co and Cd as additives. Some of these alcohols were unreactive or less reactive individually, but more reactive in competition. These findings were explained in terms of the interaction of the substrate with oxygen-covered metal catalyst, which depends on the dissociation ability of the alcohols. The promoting effect of Co and Cd additives on the Pd catalyst was also based on the concept of metal-substrate interaction. Key words: alcohol oxidation, palladium-carbon catalyst, liquid-phase oxidation Introduction The platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir ), supported on carbon, are very active and selective catalysts for the liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids [ 1-5 ] . The reaction proceeds in alkaline media under mild conditions, moderate temperature and low oxygen pressure. The reaction system is composed of three phases, oxygen-liquid-solid catalyst, where gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer limitation usually occur [ 6 ] . A high excess of oxygen in the liquid phase irreversibly deactivates the catalyst [ 7,8 ] . In regard to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, this deactivation process is governed by the coverage of the metal surface by oxygen atoms. It is generally believed that oxidation of alcohols proceeds via an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism and, under steady-state conditions, the catalytic process depends on a balance between the dehydrogenation step and the subsequent oxidation of the surface metal hydride species by adsorbed oxygen. Usually, in all studies, only one alcohol is allowed to react for the investigation of catalysis under different reaction conditions.

Catal. 83 (1993) 75-82 the reactivity of alcohols should allow the use of the competitive method, in which two compounds react simultaneously. In this method some factors affecting the reactivity, e.g. mass-transfer limitations, the composition and properties of catalyst, as well as catalyst deactivation, are cancelled out because they affect the reactivity of both substrates equally. The subject of the present study is an investigation of the influence of the structure of an alcohol on its competitive oxidation over a monometallic Pd/ C-type catalyst, or the same catalyst modified by Co and Cd additives. Experimental Materials Alcohols were either commercial products or were prepared according to literature methods. Prior to reaction they Were purified by distillation. Di-0isopropylidene-a-L-sorbose (DIS) was purified by double crystallization from methanol. Catalysts The palladium catalyst (Pd/C) was prepared by the impregnation of charcoal (particle size < 0.12 mm, surface area 1265 m2 g-1) with PdC12 (60 C, 8 h), followed by reduction with formaldehyde. Part of the catalyst was impregnated (80 C, 5 h), with Co and Cd chlorides, which were transformed to the hydroxides by adding a solution of NaOH. The catalysts thus obtained were thoroughly washed with water and stored moist, under nitrogen or filtered and dried in air. The metal content (5% Pd/C or 5% Pd-2% Co-0.7% Cd/C) of these catalysts was determined by polarography. Apparatus Oxidation experiments were carried out in a 50 ml stainless steel reactor connected with a flexible metal capillary to the apparatus for measuring the oxygen consumption at constant pressure. The reactor was filled with reactants, catalyst and oxygen, heated in a thermostated oil bath, and shaken with a vibrator. The reaction of alcohols with degassed catalyst in the absence of oxygen was examined in glass tubes sealed with a screw cap fitted with a silicone septum. The tube was evacuated, flushed several times with nitrogen and immersed in a silicone oil bath (80 C) . Analysis Samples of the reaction mixtures were extracted (3 X ) with ether and analyzed for alcohols by the GC method (Hewlett Packard 5890) . To avoid the effect of adsorption of alcohols on charcoal the same amounts of pairs of alcohols and catalyst were mixed in alkaline media 24 h under nitrogen, then M. Hronec et al. / J. Mot. Catal. 83 (1993) 75-82 77 extracted (3 X ) with ether and analyzed for alcohols. These results were used as a basis to determine the correlation for alcohol conversion in real samples. Results Prior to the competitive experiments, individual alcohols were oxidized in alkaline media in the presence of monometallic Pd/C and trimetallic Pd-CoCd/C catalysts (Table 1). The results reveal that impregnation with Co and Cd exerts a strong influence on the activity of the palladium catalyst. This is well manifested in the oxidation of 4-chlorobenzhydrole and DIS to the corresponding ketone and carboxylic acid The monometallic Pd/C catalyst which is exposed to oxygen prior to the reaction (the catalyst is dried and stored in air after preparation), is almost inactive in the oxidation of DIS and 4-chlorobenzhydrole . However, the same palladium catalyst doped with Co and Cd displays a high activity, even though it was exposed to oxygen before reaction. Different results were obtained when DIS was oxidized with the monometallic Pd/C catalyst stored under moist conditions after reduction with formaldehyde. The reduced catalyst already possesses a high activity, but a little lower than the trimetallic Pd-Co-Cd/C catalyst stored in air. In contrast to 4-chlorobenzhydrole and DIS, the other alcohols studied are also oxidized with the oxygenated Pd/C catalyst. The nonoxidizability of DIS in the presence of the Pd/C catalyst stored in air is altered when DIS is oxidized in pairs with benzylalcohol, cyclohexanol or other alcohols (Table 2). These results reveal that DIS in admixture with alcohols can be oxidized with the oxygenated Pd/C catalyst; the multimetallic catalyst is yet more active, however.

One can also use the results on the competitive oxidation of alcohols in binary mixtures to obtain data on the influence of the structure or substituents of an alcohol on its oxidizability over the heterogeneous palladium catalyst. Thus, in binary mixtures of benzyl alcohol with its methyl, methoxy, chloro and nitro derivatives, benzyl alcohol is oxidized preferentially. The differences in conversions are not great, however. Of the alcohols studied, only 4-chloroand 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol are oxidized preferentially. However, in admixture with aliphatic alcohols or cycloalkanols, the conversion of benzyl alcohol is always much higher. The ratio of oxidizability of both alcohols in binary mixtures is almost independent of the degree of conversion, and it is only little changed with temperature. It is interesting that secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones with a conversion of only 10-40% , but the conversion of benzyl alcohol is above 90%. If binary mixtures of cyclohexanol are competitively oxidized with primary or secondary aliphatic alcohols, the reaction spontaneously stops at the M. Hronec et al. / J. Mol.

The competitive reaction is very sensitive to the structure of the alcohols and the composition of the binary mixtures. For example, under the conditions used, the conversion of sec-butanol in admixture with cyclohexanol is higher (64%) than that of cyclohexanol. In combination with benzyl alcohol (Table 2), however, this value reaches only 10.5%. It is interesting that, though n-butanol and benzhydrole in admixture with benzyl alcohol are oxidized to an approximately equal conversion of ca. 2530% (Table 2 ), in the binary mixture of n-butanol with benzhydrole, n-butanol is predominantly oxidized (Table 3). Differences were also observed between the reactivity of isomeric sec- and iso-butanols. Discussion It is supposed that the oxidation of alcohols in alkaline media proceeds through an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism. The metal must simultaneously perform two functions: dehydrogenation of the substrate and oxidation of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms formed in the dehydrogenation step. Alcohol serves as a hydrogen donor for the catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. Adsorbed hydrogen atoms are oxidized by oxygen atoms sorbed on the palladium surface or dissolved in the palladium lattice [9,10]. The interaction of the palladium lattice with oxygen atoms forms a solid phase which, in the first step of alcohol oxidation, interacts with alcohol. Alcohol dissociates on the surface of the metal catalyst, producing hydrogen atoms, which are adsorbed on the Pd surface and subsequently oxidized by oxygen atoms sorbed on the palladium surface or dissolved in the upper layers of 80 M. Hronec et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 75-82 the Pd lattice. According to this model, alcohol in the first step reduces the oxygenated form of the metal catalyst. Experiments in an inert atmosphere have actually shown that the interaction of some alcohols with the oxygenated surface of the catalyst results in the formation of oxidation products. Since hydrogen atoms formed in the dehydrogenation reaction are oxidized by oxygen bound to the catalyst, in the course of several such cycles in an inert atmosphere, oxygen on the catalyst surface is consumed and no further oxidation proceeds. It seems that the ability of alcohol to reduce the oxidized form of the catalyst plays a significant role in the mechanism of this type of oxidation. If the reducing power of the alcohol is low, then its oxidation on the oxygenated Pd catalyst does not proceed at all. In this way one can explain why DIS and 4chlorobenzhydrole are not oxidized in the presence of a catalyst which has been exposed to oxygen before reaction. To support this reaction in the case of the alcohols mentioned above, one needs to have the oxygenated surface of the Pd catalyst to be reduced, at least partially. This function is fulfilled in the presence of alcohols with stronger reduction abilities. This is why DIS is oxidized in a binary mixture with benzyl alcohol, in contrast to DIS alone, even with a Pd catalyst stored in air. Removal of oxygen from the catalyst surface and its transformation into a reduced form is probably also the reason why pretreatment of the palladium catalyst with olefins before reaction increases both the activity and selectivity of the Pd catalyst in oxidation and hydrogenation reactions [ 11,12 ] . In an oxygen atmosphere, the oxidation of alcohols on the catalyst surface obeys Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. This means that the Pd surface is covered by oxygen, alcohol, hydrogen atoms and products. The fraction of the surface covered by each component depends on experimental conditions, e.g. partial pressure of oxygen, concentration and type of alcohol. According to the L-H mechanism, the rate of oxidation is governed by a delicate balance between the fraction of the metal surface occupied by alcohol and the fraction occupied by oxygen. As was observed at higher partial pressures of oxygen, the catalyst is reversibly deactivated, i.e. the catalyst surface is occupied only by oxygen [ 1,6,8,13 ] . For this reason the kinetic regime of oxidation which needs a large excess of both reactants can be reached only with difficulty. The present experiments therefore confirm that the rate of alcohol oxidation is influenced by the mass-transfer of reactants. However, these factors are eliminated in a competitive method because they affect the reactivity of both substrates equally. Two main reaction steps occur during the oxidation of alcohols on the metal surface: dehydrogenation of the alcohol and oxidation of the hydrogen formed by adsorbed oxygen atoms (Scheme 1) . The first step is reversible and second irreversible. It seems that the overall rate of oxidation is strongly influenced by the rate of the second reaction. This is assumed on the basis of experiments with the oxidation of secondary alcohols which are oxidized to the corresponding ketones at conversions which M. Hronec et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 75-82 81 R-CH-R, O 0 R-C-R, H H 0 O I ~ II ' OH O 0- 1_1> le- -19111* R-CO-R' R-C-R, H H O O .~. H20 O It , O Scheme 1. are always lower than 50%. An exception is 4-chlorobenzhydrole in a binary mixture with benzyl alcohol or cyclohexanol. The added ketone retards the rate of oxidation and suppresses the conversion of alcohol. One explanation is that hydrogen atoms formed by the dissociation of alcohols hydrogenate ketone back to alcohol, then they react irreversibly with oxygen. The reason is that the reaction of adsorbed hydrogen atoms with oxygen atoms sorbed on the Pd surface or dissolved in the Pd lattice is influenced by migration of the adsorbed oxygen atoms. This elementary step is probably rate determining, since the diffusion coefficient of oxygen atoms in noble metals is small [ 14 ] . This can explain why the oxidation of secondary alcohols produces the corresponding ketones with conversions which are markedly lower than 50% . In the oxidation of primary alcohols, back-hydrogenation of the oxidation product, carboxylic acids, is suppressed as a result of the conversion of acids to sodium salts in the reaction medium. A low conversion in the oxidation of secondary alcohols and the retarding influence of added ketone may also be the result of catalyst deactivation due to blockage of the active sites by side-products formed in the aqueous alkaline media by dimerization or polymerization of ketone. For example, in the oxidation of individual 1-methoxy-2-propanol the selectivity of formation of 1methoxy-2-propanone depends on the basicity of the medium and the doping of the Pd catalyst by a lead promotor [ 15 ] . In our experiments with the oxidation of this alcohol, the selectivity of the reaction using fresh and reused PdBi-Zn/C catalyst was 87-89%. The activity of the reused catalyst was about 35-40% lower. However, in the competitive method, decrease of catalyst activity by side products influences the oxidation of both alcohols equally. This also indicates the same ratio of oxidizability of pairs of alcohols at a different degree of conversion. On the basis of the above results and the literature data [ 1,8,13 ] we assume that both the equilibrium concentrations of reactants adsorbed on the Pd surface and the reduction power of alcohols are responsible for the activity and reversible deactivation of catalyst. The promoting effect of metals used for impregnation of the Pd catalyst (Co, Cd) is probably connected with their ability to change the stability of the palladium surface toward oxidation, i.e. the fraction of metallic palladium and the amount of oxidized palladium at the surface. Recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies [5] of lead-pro- 82 M. Hronec et al. / J. Mot. Catal. 83 (1993) 75-82 moted palladium catalysts have shown that the coverage of palladium by adsorbed lead stabilizes the metallic state of palladium. Lead ad-atoms on the Pd surface act as a barrier towards oxygen migration into the palladium lattice. Palladium remains mainly in the metallic state and the amount of PdO and oxygen dissolved in Pd is small. This may explain the experimentally observed findings that alcohols with lower reducing power are also oxidized on Pd catalysts impregnated by Co and Cd and stored in air, e.g. DIS or 4-chlorobenzhydrole. Moreover, impregnation of the Pd catalyst can also influence the catalyst-alcohol interaction, which leads to an increase of the rate of the dissociation of alcohol. References 1 J.W.
