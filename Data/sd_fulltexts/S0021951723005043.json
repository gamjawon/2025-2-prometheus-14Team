Graphical abstract Keywords Synthesis Bulk materials Deposited catalysts Standardization Rigor & reproducibility Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Differences in the properties of heterogeneous catalysts are an intrinsic function of the compositional and structural complexity of these materials which are, in turn, determined by the specifics of their method of synthesis, storage, and (pre)treatment. Despite the wide range of material classes that are studied as heterogeneous catalysts, there are several common aspects of synthesis procedures that influence the properties of the resulting catalysts, including temperature, reagent concentration(s), solution pH, and extent of mixing during synthesis, as well as contamination in reagents and glassware, among many other factors. Even minor variations in these synthetic parameters can translate to alterations in both the physical and chemical properties of the materials such as purity, particle size, surface area, etc. Since these properties dictate catalytic activity, preparation methods need to be described in sufficient detail to ensure the reproducibility of catalyst performance. In this Perspective, we provide recommendations for best practices in the reporting of synthesis procedures for bulk and deposited heterogeneous catalytic materials. Bulk catalysts are broadly defined here as those that are unsupported or serve as nanoparticle supports; mainly bulk oxides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, clays, and colloidal nanoparticles. For the most part, the synthesis of these materials involves the crystallization of mono- or polycrystalline materials through precipitation of powders out of a liquid solution or the reduction of precursors to form a colloidal suspension. The properties of the bulk can differ from those of the surfaces and exposed atoms that drive catalytic reactivity for these materials, and the precise nature of the surface of bulk materials is influenced by their synthesis conditions. A challenge in reproducibly generating bulk catalysts is that the active surface can be difficult to fully characterize. Deposited catalysts are defined here as those in which a pre-synthesized support is placed in contact with a precursor in a fluid phase to react, be adsorbed, or otherwise be deposited, followed by a pre-treatment to form the active phase. Our focus is on transition metals with structures ranging from atomically dispersed species to larger nanoparticles. Examples of deposition methods include wet/dry (incipient wetness) impregnation, ion exchange, strong electrostatic adsorption, atomic layer deposition, and grafting of organometallic precursors, among others. The process of deposition can influence the distribution of structural features of the active phase, as well as the incorporation of other species onto the catalyst from the deposition source (e.g., counter ion or ligands). Challenges with using characterization tools to identify clear differences between two samples of the same material that exhibit different catalytic performance, despite being made using similar approaches, suggest that reports on the synthesis of catalysts must be sufficiently detailed to facilitate reproducibility. Remarkably, differences in synthetic procedures that appear trivial can measurably change the structure and reactivity of a material. Once the active phase is initially produced, the storage and (pre)treatment of the material can also influence the resulting reactivity. Thus, it is critical to define the necessary information that should be reported during the synthesis, storage, and treatment of bulk and deposited catalysts to enable reliable reproducibility [1]. This, in turn, will facilitate the development of robust catalytic structure–function relationships [1]. 1.2 Motivating examples Regardless of materials class, each lab has a set of standard procedures they use to synthesize catalytic materials. These procedures are generally adapted from a set of steps previously reported in the literature [2,3,4,5], which can result in differences in both the physical and chemical properties of the materials due to experimental nuances and unreported adjustments to the method that are unique to each lab. Treatments after synthesis also affect the properties of the catalyst [6]. These include heating rates and hold times during drying, calcination, and reduction/passivation, as well as static or dynamic pre-treatment atmospheres (where weight hourly space velocity of flowing gases should be reported) for obtaining the final active material. Furthermore, characteristics of the support material, including structural features, composition, surface area, pre-treatment, etc., can influence the resulting deposited species. Although these variables are important, they are often unreported. A few motivating examples are provided to highlight how synthetic, storage, and pre-treatment conditions can significantly influence the resulting catalyst properties. 1. The roles of contaminants in the support and pre-treatment conditions: Commercial alumina (Al2O3) is derived from aluminum hydroxides or alumina gels (e.g., ex Al2(SO4)3 + NaAlO2). The latter can contain residual quantities of S and Na (0.01–0.1 wt%). When Pt is deposited via impregnation from H2PtCl6 on S-containing Al2O3 and reduced in H2 at temperatures >573 K, the resulting Pt surfaces can become poisoned with S. The S-poisoned Pt catalysts exhibit different dispersions that depend on both the S content and dispersion measurement technique when analyzed by chemisorption (hydrogen chemisorption, oxygen chemisorption, hydrogen–oxygen titration) due to specific interaction of the probing molecules with surface-bound S on Pt. Further, depending on the technique used for surface area measurements, the resulting turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the probe reaction—hydrogenation of cyclohexene—can vary significantly [7]. Beyond acting as a poison, contaminants can affect the reproducibility of syntheses. In a synthesis of NiO on Al2O3 supports, Na content changed the dispersion [8]. In washing the supports to remove contaminants high pHs are used for cation exchange and low pHs are used for washing cationic impurities. Other important examples exist regarding the general issue of contamination caused by the synthesis apparatus, or the materials and supplies used during synthesis [9,10]. This issue has been highlighted in the syntheses of colloidal metal nanoparticles, where the purity of a reagent can vary between different batches and lot numbers from the same supplier, and this information (or awareness of this sensitivity) is critical to successfully repeating the reaction [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. 2. The role of mixing time during deposition precipitation: Although Au/TiO2, Au/Al2O3, and Au/CeO2 catalysts prepared by deposition precipitation show rapid and complete metal uptake, smaller particle sizes are obtained when using longer contact times. This is attributed to the fast precipitation of large Au aggregates followed by increased pH due to urea decomposition resulting in the fragmentation and redispersion of the active phase [19,20]. In general, the mixing time can dictate whether slow reactions associated with the metal precursors (e.g., aquation or speciation) or support (oxidation or hydroxylation) proceed that could influence the nature of the deposited species. 3. The role of activation procedure: The Phillips catalyst (Cr/SiO2) is widely used to produce high-density polyethylene. If activated in a fluidized bed with dry air, all particles are exposed to a similar concentration of water vapor, uniformly forming the desired Cr(VI) species. However, if the activation is performed in a fixed bed, this leads to a gradient from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) down the bed as water vapor builds up [21]. As a result, the commercial activation is performed in a fluidized bed to minimize the exposure of the catalyst to water at high temperatures. 4. The role of storage environment: Catalysts are often prepared and then stored in the lab for extended periods of time before use. The conditions of storage and length of time can be important. For example, it was shown via surface science analysis that when TiO2 is exposed to ambient environments (both in Vienna, Austria, and Ithaca, United States), a complete surface coverage of carboxylic acids forms, even though these species exist in ppb concentrations in the atmosphere. Without proper in situ cleaning of the TiO2 surfaces, these adsorbed layers are likely to influence reactivity measurements [22]. Furthermore, it is known that ppb-level exposure of Ni catalysts to H2S can reduce catalytic rates by an order of magnitude. Given that natural environments can contain H2S at close to ppb levels, this could certainly influence the results of catalytic materials if not appreciated [23]. 1.3 Overview The guidelines presented in this Perspective are primarily focused on how to improve the description of synthetic methods in the literature to ensure that they are comprehensive, thereby enabling reproducible materials synthesis. We make suggestions for detailed reporting to be included in the supplementary information of journal publications. The identification of synthetic steps that are commonly unreported (or reported in insufficient detail) and corresponding suggestions for details to be included to better facilitate reproducible outcomes result from consideration of the following questions: (i) What steps of the synthesis, storage, and pre-treatment procedures need to be described thoroughly in order to ensure the resulting material properties are reproducible? (ii) What synthetic parameters are often unreported that can affect material outcomes? What parameters do we as a community think are important to report for increasing reproducibility? (iii) What characterization(s) of the material are needed at a minimum to ensure that the sample is the same as previously reported or to compare to a benchmark? We also address the necessity of reporting specifics that are critical to the success of a particular synthesis, such as precursor purity (including characterization of known impurities) and batch-to-batch variation, as well as any other “tips and tricks.” Following a section focused on synthetic parameters that are common across material types, the subsequent sections of this Perspective describe sensitivities that are unique to certain material classes and provide specific additional recommendations for particular synthesis procedures. 2 Known limitations and recommendations for reporting synthesis procedures Although differences exist in the specific synthetic protocols for different material classes, there are common trends regarding experimental parameters that could benefit from more thorough, detailed reporting in the literature to facilitate reproducible synthesis outcomes across different laboratories and within a given laboratory [12]. These parameters can be classified into five general categories: (1) preparation of reagents and apparatus, (2) synthesis procedure, (3) post-treatment/ preparation for storage, (4) storage, and (5) activation and pre-treatment prior to use in chemical reactions. In Table 1 , each of these categories is listed along with examples of specific parameters that, although critical to reproducible synthesis, are commonly unreported. 2.1 Preparation of reagents and apparatus Most synthesis procedures found in the literature indicate the source of the chemical precursors used in the synthesis and often also include the gases used and their purity. However, in many cases, more detail is needed to reproducibly obtain the same material. For example, in zeolite synthesis, the method used to clean the vessel where the materials synthesis takes place is important (base bath or acid wash) [24]. Consequently, we recommend reporting in detail the parameters shown in Table 1. 2.2 Synthesis procedure While synthesis procedures generally include what reagents are needed and their concentrations or volumes, there is no standardized method of describing synthesis experiments that outlines what information should be included. Consequently, critical information often goes unreported, affecting the reproducibility of the synthesis method. For example, although the volumes of ligand and metal precursor solutions are often listed for MOF synthesis, the order of addition or rate of addition are not. Equally important for MOFs is to evaluate and report the nature of any defects and their concentrations. These defects can be relevant active sites that contribute to catalyst performance, thus when defects are not characterized and reported, this can cause variability of unknown origin from sample to sample [25].” Additionally, stir rates and how heating is carried out are often not reported for metal oxide synthesis. Table 1 shows the specifics we recommend including, at a minimum, in the reporting of the synthesis procedure. 2.3 Post-treatment/ preparation for storage Once the bulk or deposited materials are synthesized, they frequently require additional steps prior to characterization or storage until further use. This is often the part of a synthesis that is reported in the least detail. It is customary to report washing or purification steps and the solvent used for a treatment prior to a characterization, but not the volumes and purity of the washing solvent or the number of times the purification was carried out. It is also common to read that a material was filtered, but the sensitivity of the filtration procedure to solvent purity or water content is not reported. For sol–gel syntheses, for example, parameters such as the stirring time (or if it was stirred) and the evaporation rates of the solvent are often not specifically detailed. In Table 1, we recommend some specifics (when relevant) to be included at a minimum in the reporting of any post-treatment prior to characterization or storage. In general, it can be helpful to perform analyses to identify optimal temperatures for drying, precursor decomposition, precursor oxidation, precursor reduction, ion removal, etc. These are often executed using differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-programmed oxidation/reduction, and thermal gravimetric analysis. While not required to promote reproducibility, these analyses are encouraged to provide insights into the choice of pre-treatment conditions and the influence they can have on the resulting material properties. Regardless of how the conditions are chosen, there is critical information for making the processes reproducible that should be reported. It is also worth highlighting the importance of the treatment reactor. As we pay great attention to finite rates of transport and gradients in reactors employed to test catalysts, it would be beneficial to pay comparable attention to the characteristics of the reactor employed to prepare the catalyst, as gradients in temperature and concentrations can cause significant inhomogeneities in the resulting materials. For example, the flow rate of treatment gases can dictate the concentration of volatile species produced (e.g., HCl during H2 treatment of a catalyst made using Cl based precursor), which can influence the resulting metal dispersion. 2.4 Storage Bulk and deposited catalysts are often metastable materials subject to changing surface and even bulk composition or phase over time—such as hydroxyl concentrations on the surface, oxidation state, and alloying. However, the way materials are stored after synthesis and how they might be expected to change and/or degrade over time are generally not reported, even though this information can be critical to reproducing catalyst performance. It is also not common to report how soon the material was used after synthesis or differences in reactivity seen when a material ages in the lab for longer times. Additionally, it is important to report on what form the catalyst is stored in (e.g., passivated carbide/nitride, colloidal suspension vs. dried powder, unactivated MOF). Any storage conditions for reagents/materials should also be reasonably described, as they could be relevant to reproducible synthesis. If any storage dependencies are observed, this should be specifically noted and reported, as well as if material performance changes over time or with aging. It is particularly important to be aware of any such changes in material composition or quality if catalytic experiments are conducted over a large time range. Table 1 shows some recommended parameters to be included in reporting the storage conditions for a synthesized material. 2.5 Activation and pre-treatment prior to use in chemical reactions Before use in a catalytic reaction, it is likely that the material has been passivated, stored in a solution, has residual capping agents from synthesis, contain adsorbed molecules, etc., which dictate the need for pre-treatment and activation. Clear procedures need to be reported for any hygroscopic or easily oxidized material, including the time taken from the storage (oven or desiccator) to the scale and to the reactor. Notes regarding the quickness in this transition or precautions (e.g., inert atmosphere) to avoid mass water uptake and oxidation of the surface material need to be reported to reproducibly use these materials after storage. We recommend as a standard practice explicitly describing any activation process that is carried out after synthesis (i.e., solvent exchange, ligand removal, combustion, calcination, etc.), recognizing that some in situ treatments may be described as part of the synthesis procedure. 3 Additional specific parameters for common deposition methods Table 1 showed a comprehensive list of recommended parameters to improve the reproducibility in the synthesis of bulk and deposited materials. In this section, focus is given to some of the most commonly used deposition methods, including incipient wetness impregnation, wet impregnation, strong electrostatic adsorption, deposition precipitation, ion exchange, atomic layer deposition, and air-free deposition methods. Although this list is not exhaustive, the specific information required for consistent reproducibility of these methods highlights a majority of the specifics that should be reported in deposition techniques not commented on. In Table 2 , we make additional recommendations for reporting the different deposition synthetic approaches. These specific overview sections are accompanied by references that provide more detailed discussions on the synthesis methods and the influence of synthetic parameters on the resulting materials properties. 3.1 Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is one of the most common methods for the synthesis of deposited catalysts [26,27,28]. First, it is necessary to measure the incipient volume (pore volume) by addition of small volumes of solvent (generally water) until the material is homogeneously wet without running (saturation). Once known, the specific amount of precursor solution needed to provide the desired weight loading is dissolved into that volume. Then, this solution is added dropwise to the support with intermittent mixing, dried, and subjected to pre-treatment to form the active phase. If the mass of precursor needed is above what can be dissolved in the incipient volume of solvent, successive impregnations with intermediate drying are required. It is worth highlighting that the pore volume obtained from liquid measurement might differ from that obtained in the gas phase (e.g., BET measurements) due to the ability of gas to fill the micropores as well. This causes a difference in the deposition of the active phase and particle size distributions. 3.2 Wet impregnation (WI) Unlike the IWI method, wet impregnation (WI) does not require measurement of the incipient support volume (pore volume), as the total mass of precursor required is dissolved in a specified volume of solvent, which is in excess to fill the pore volume [28,29,30]. Once the support is put in contact with the precursor solution, these are homogeneously mixed and subjected to a drying protocol, followed by a pre-treatment to form the active catalyst. 3.3 Strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) Strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of charged species onto oppositely charged support surfaces is frequently used for synthesizing atomically dispersed catalysts and/or supported monometallic/bimetallic nanoparticles with ultra-small sizes [31,32,33,34]. To achieve this, metal precursors and synthesis pH are chosen such that the net charge of the support surface is opposite to that of the precursor, in such a way that the precursor electrostatically adsorbs to the support but repels other precursor molecules. This creates a situation where metal dispersion is maximized, at least prior to pre-treatment. In principle, the SEA synthesis process is simple and intuitive: oppositely charged species attract each other. In practice, however, complications can arise due to interactions between charged solution species and high surface area supports. 3.4 Deposition precipitation (DP) This method consists of the transformation of a precursor into a different compound with lower solubility in the medium, usually through a pH change. In the presence of a support, this results in the deposition and dispersion of the active phase. Frequently, deposition precipitation is carried out in the presence of urea, as its decomposition increases the pH gradually to avoid bulk phases in solution [35,36,37]. Deposition precipitation can also be conducted by decreasing the pH, using a reducing agent, changing the concentration of a complexing agent, or through a change of the valence state of the precursor via electrochemical reactions [36]. 3.5 Ion-exchange (IE) methods Ion exchange is mainly used to incorporate metal cations into zeolites. The presence of Al3+ replacing some Si4+ in the structure leads to negative charges that can be counterbalanced by metal cations [38]. Although ion exchange (IE) has been frequently used to refer to strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA), it is worth highlighting that, unlike SEA, IE is pH independent [34,39]. Although IE can also be performed in solid state (e.g., through a grinding process), it is most commonly done in aqueous medium. Due to the reversible nature of the exchange, zeolites are usually put in contact with different fresh solutions of metal cations with intermediate filtering processes to maximize the uptake. 3.6 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is carried out by alternating exposures of metal precursors and a co-reactant to a support surface, often repeatedly [40,41]. This is typically used with the goal of creating conformal, well-defined reactive species. Conformal deposition relies on surface self-limiting reactions between the molecules (precursors and co-reactants) and generated surface intermediates. Although some liquid-phase ALD methods have been reported, most ALD used for catalyst synthesis is carried out in the gas phase. The structure and composition of active phases prepared by ALD can be tuned by altering the deposition sequence and number of cycles. 3.7 Grafting/vacuum or air-free techniques Grafting/vacuum or air-free techniques, also known as surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) or surface organometallic grafting (SOG), consists of the anchorage of organometallic or gas phase precursors (e.g., metal oxyhalides such as VOCl3) to a support via reaction with surface groups (e.g., silanol). Those anchored species can be directly used as catalysts or can be transformed/modified into others (e.g., metal nanoparticles) through thermal treatments to be used as catalysts or to incorporate new organometallic compounds [38,42,43]. For that reason, it is desirable to use precursors with ligands that can be easily decomposed (e.g., HCl for VOCl3). As most organometallic precursors are air-sensitive and/or moisture-sensitive or have increased sensitivity when supported on high surface area metal oxides, it is critical to perform the grafting under an inert atmosphere using glove boxes and/or Schenk techniques. 4 Other recommendations for best practices In many cases, reproducibility can be improved by better reporting of observations made during synthesis (Fig. 1 ). It is important to train all new students and researchers in the field to recognize that extra details recorded in lab notebooks—such as noted observations of color, precipitation, etc.; the speed of these observable changes; reagent lot numbers; and deviations from procedure—are critical to ensuring synthesis reproducibility. In this section we list a few more recommendations regarding batch size, replicates, reporting of negative results, and characterization. In general, issues with batch-to-batch variability can be eliminated by using the material from a single batch, though this is not always feasible depending on batch size and scalability. However, even studies performed with materials from a single batch should include information about how the material changes with time during storage or use, and if any pre-treatment is needed to return the catalyst to a state of reproducible reactivity (if degraded or modified by aging). It is important to be aware that material storage can influence reactivity, and we recommend regularly repeating a selected control experiment to test for effects of aging or storage on reactivity when conducting experiments over an extended period of time. Additionally, reporting of materials syntheses should include how many batches of material were made and how often/well the product was reproducible. If the synthesis was not repeated, it should be explicitly stated that a statistical measure of reproducibility from batch-to-batch was too prohibitive in terms of time or cost. Multiple batches should be synthesized if the manuscript is the first reported synthesis of a particular material. It is common to carry out a series of small batch syntheses of a new material before scaling up, but information about these experiments and their reproducibility is rarely reported. Measurements of reactivity and resulting kinetic parameter estimates including statistical analysis derived from testing multiple batches of samples are most likely to be reproducible by others. We also suggest an increase in the reporting of negative results and sensitivities in the description of the synthesis. For example: “this order of addition did not yield crystalline material,” or “oxidation in air leads to an inactive catalyst, therefore activation must occur under nitrogen,” or “carrying out solvent exchange in a different way leads to…,” or “closely following this procedure was found to be necessary to ensure good yield.” If a specific step of the procedure is important to successful synthesis, including phrases such as “these are the sensitive parts of the synthesis” may be informative to a new researcher in the field. Common pitfalls should also be mentioned in the synthesis procedures, such as MgO adsorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, and that carbide passivation rate matters. Lot numbers for reagents need to be reported if a sensitivity is found. All these statements signal to the reader that sensitivities and reproducibility information can be found in the experimental section or supporting information. A material synthesis that is not sensitive for reproducibility can be indicated by stating “no known sensitivities” in order to help future scientists have confidence in the method. We also recommend including the full synthesis details in the supporting information even if they appear in the main text because the supporting information is freely available, thus ensuring that resources are accessible to a variety of researchers. Further, reporting of synthesis procedures of different catalysts in a manuscript may be best accomplished using tables describing specifics rather than in narrative form. The full experimental procedure should be listed in every publication, even if it is a previously published synthesis, in order to avoid long or broken citation trails. To facilitate this, we recommend that editors relax rules around self-plagiarism for experimental sections of manuscripts, especially for detailed descriptions that can be included in the supporting information document. It is also important to point out any deviations, however slight they may seem, from a previously published synthesis. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ana C.
