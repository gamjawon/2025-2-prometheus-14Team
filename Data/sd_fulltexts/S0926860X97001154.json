The physico- chemical properties of the vanadia-based catalysts, which control the selectivity to products of oxidative dehydrogenation vs. that to oxygenated products in the oxidation reactions, have also been considered. Keywords: Vanadia-based catalysts; Selective oxidation; Hydrocarbons The papers included in this issue and references therein show a great versatility of vanadia-based catalysts in selective oxidation reaction of organic compounds. The vanadia-based systems are active and selective in various types of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions comprising: (a) oxidative dehydrogenation, ODH of alkanes and olefins (on V-Mg-O compounds, alkaline earth metal vanadates and on systems containing [VOx],, groups dispersed on basic oxide supports) and (b) reactions with formation of the oxygenated products. In the latter reactions they are particularly active in formation of acidic organic products such as anhydrides, acids or their derivatives - esters. In fact all the heterogenous oxide catalysts used on industrial scale for production of organic anhydrides and acids contain vanadium as a main component of the active phase. These industrial processes include: synthesis of maleic anhydride, originally from benzene (V-Mo-O catalysts) and recently from n-butane (V-P-O system), phthalic anhydride PA, from o-xylene (V2OJTiO2 catalysts) and acrylic acid from acrolein (V-MoO system). The vanadia containing systems appear also promising catalysts for oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and fluorene to dicarboxylic acids and quinones (V-Fe-O system) and for oxidation of methanol to methyl formate (V-Ti-O catalysts). 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 Pure vanadium pentoxide is active in most of these reactions though usually the selectivity to the desired products of partial oxidation is low. Addition of other elements improves the selectivity. At the first look at the composition of the vanadia-based catalysts an observation can be made that the systems active in formation of acidic products contain usually elements forming oxides of more acidic character than vanadia such as Mo, P, or amphoteric oxides, whereas the ODH reactions proceed on systems in which other, beside vanadium elements (Mg, alkaline earth) form basic oxides. All the oxidation reactions on vanadia-based catalysts follow the usual for this type of process mechanism of parallel-consecutive reactions, the oxygenated products being formed in the series of successive steps (with or without desorption of intermediate products to the gas phase). The undesired carbon oxides are formed both in parallel route directly from a substrate or intermediate products and consecutive route by the oxidation of the final oxygenated product. The common feature of all the vanadia-based catalysts is the presence of the V-Ox groups. Vanadium ions in these units can be present in tetrahedral, octahedral and square pyramid environment. The V-O polyhedra are joined by corners or edges forming in some cases e.g. pure V205 and solid solutions of MoO3 in vanadia, the layered structures. In definite compounds such as vanadyl phosphates or magnesium vanadates the V-O polyhedra are separated by polyhedra containing other elements e.g. P or Mg as a central atom. Additionally, on the surface of definite vanadium compounds the dispersed VOx units can be also present. Such is the case of vanadium antimonates (cf. paper by Centi et al.) or vanadyl pyro- phosphate in which V5+ ions detected in small amounts (cf. paper by Abon and Volta) can be present in the form of dispersed VS+-O units. The separation of the VOx units can be also effectuated by dispersion of vanadia phase on oxide supports when the vanadium loading is low. It is generally accepted that at very low loading ca. 10-20% of a monolayer coverage tetrahedral isolated VOx species are present, whereas with the increase in the V loading octahedral VO~ species forming chains V-O-V appear (cf. paper by Wachs and Weckhuysen). Deposition of vanadia on oxide supports may lead to formation of special bidimensional structures of monolayer type proposed by Bond (cf. his paper in this issue). The structure of the monolayer species and coverage with them even for the same support is not completely solved and depends on the preparation method, presence of impurities in the support, its morphology etc. The structure and properties of the dispersed species are influenced also by the type of the support: the basic and amphoteric oxides favour the bidimensional dispersion (in some cases with the formation of surface vanadium compounds e.g. the vanadates), whereas the acidic ones, e.g. SiO2, the formation of tridimensional microunits of V205. The problem of the vanadia phase dispersed on different supports has been approached by Bond et al., and Blasco and Lopez Nieto (this issue). Nevertheless the differences in opinions concerning the detailed structure of the dispersed species and the coverage with them, in some fraction of the dispersed B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 411 species the existence of the V-O-Support or more precisely V-O-Men+ bond (where Men+ is a cation) seems to be unquestionable. The environment of the VOx units, the existence of bonds V-O-Men+ in the vanadium compounds or in the vanadium-oxygen species on the support should effect the distribution of electronic cloud densities around vanadium and oxygen atoms which is reflected in degree of ionicity of the V-O bond i.e. nucleophilicity of oxygen and electrophilicity of vanadium ions. These latter parameters can be related to the acido-basic properties and reducibility of the system. One would expect that higher electronegativity of Men+ element (e.g. P) as compared with that of V ions would render the oxygen atom in the V-O-Men+ unit less nucleophilic (less basic) and vanadium atom more electrophilic (acidic) than in V-O-V bonds. When Men+ is an ion of lower electronegativity than that of V (e.g. Mg2+ or K+) oxygen atoms in the V-O--Men+ units become more nucleophilic and vanadium less electrophilic. The experimental data confirm this supposition, the V-P-O catalysts exhibiting high acidity and low basicity, whereas the inverse is true for the V-Mg-O system. The formal valence state of vanadium in different vanadia-based systems varies between V5+ (V205, VOPO4, magnesium vanadates, VO4 tetrahedra and VO6 octahedra on MgO, hydrotalcite, sepiolite and A1203) to V4+ (vanadyl pyro- phosphate, solid solutions of MoO3 in VzOs) and the mixture of V3+ and V4+ in vanadium antimonate. In most cases, however, the presence of both V5+ and the reduced vanadium ions, irrespective of the formal valence state of a V-compound has been observed even in the fresh catalysts. In the stationary state of the oxidation reactions all catalysts contain both oxidized and reduced vanadium cations, the ratio of them depending on the reaction conditions and the nature of a hydrocarbon which is oxidized. If we assume namely that the oxidation involves the catalyst oxygen and proceeds by a redox, Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism, the surface coverage with active oxygen 69 in the steady state of the oxidation reaction is given by 1 O= (krPH/koPo2) -f- 1' where PH and Po2 are partial pressures of hydrocarbon and oxygen, respectively, and kr and ko are the rate constants of the reduction and reoxidation step, respectively. For a constant value of the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio in the reaction mixture, PH/Po2 and for the same catalyst (and hence a constant ko), the value of O and 1-6) (the reduction degree of a catalyst) will be the lower, the lower is the value of kr. On the other hand kr will be smaller the lower is the energy of a C-H bond which is broken in a first, r.d.s, of the reduction, kr will then increase with the increase in the number of C atoms in an oxidized molecule and will be lower for alkanes than for olefins and alkylaromafics. It follows from the above given considerations that the reduction degree of the catalyst manifested in the presence of vanadium ions 412 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 of valency lower than V5+ should be higher in oxidation of olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons as compared with that in alkane oxidation. Confirmation of this reasoning has been found by the surface potential measurements of the state of pure vanadia and V2Os/TiO2 catalysts in the reaction mixtures containing alkanes, or olefins of different carbon number. Direct determination of the amount of the reduced vanadium ions in the vanadia-titania catalysts after the reaction by the chemical analysis has shown high degree of reduction (ca. 20% of all vanadium ions) after the o-xylene oxidation (cf. the paper by Grzybowska) and practically no reduction after the ODH of propane [1]. More extensive reduction of V5+ species on supports in butene than in butane oxidation has been observed from the Raman data [2]. The surface of the vanadia-based catalysts then exhibits the cationic centres V5+ and V4+ linked in different manners to anionic oxide centres. The V-O groups are present in V-O-V or V--O-Men+ units, and in V=O terminal vanadyl groups sticking out of the surface. For the definite vanadium oxidic compounds the arrangement of these centres depends on the crystal face exposed preferentially on the catalyst surface. The effect of the morphology of catalyst crystal grains on the catalytic performance reported for some vanadia-based catalysts e.g. V2OJTiO2 in o-xylene oxidation (cf. paper by Grzybowska), V-P-O in n-butane oxidation [3], V205 in methanol oxidation [4,5] can furnish some information about the role of various centres in the oxidation process. The unsaturation in coordination and charge of vanadium and oxygen centres on the surface, resulting from the cutting of the crystal structure may lead to: (a) the presence of the surface OH groups bound to vanadium or to another element (e.g. P in V-P-O catalysts) which give rise to Br6nsted acidity, or (b) to the sorption of oxygen molecules and their dissociation with formation of atomic adsorbed oxygen species, especially when V4+ cations are exposed on the surface. Let us consider now how these various centres may intervene in different steps of the complex process of oxidation, involving abstraction of several hydrogen atoms and insertion of several oxygen atoms into a hydrocarbon molecule. In the oxidation of straight-chain hydrocarbons or of alkyl aromatics the activa- tion ofa C-H bond is considered as a first, often rate determining step of the reaction, which is followed by the step of incorporation of oxygen into the activated organic molecule species. Such an approach is rather simplified as both the abstraction of hydrogen and addition of oxygen can take place in a concerted reaction, but it is convenient when discussing the role of various catalyst surface centres. In many oxidation reactions surface oxide ion has been proposed as a site capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom in the form of a proton with the formation of the surface OH group [6]. If this were the case the activity should depend on the nucleophilicity (basicity) of a catalyst oxygen and such a correlation has been indeed reported for ammoxidation of propene on antimony oxide based catalysts [7], oxidative coupling, ammoxidation, and the ODH reactions on V-Sb-Bi and V-Sb-Ni oxide catalysts [8], and for oxidation of n-butane to MA on V-P-O B, Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 413 catalysts [9]. In the case of vanadia-based catalysts the nucleophilicity should be higher for oxygen bound to V4+ ion than that attached to V5+ ion, and for the same oxidation state of vanadium it should be higher in VO4 tetrahedra as compared to VO5 or VO6 units. It is also higher for oxygen in V-O-V bridges as compared with the oxygen in terminal V=O groups (cf. paper by Witko and Haber). In the activation of hydrocarbons containing 7r electrons abstraction of an H atom on an oxide centre is facilitated by donation of the 7r electrons to transition metal cation, which leads to the weakening of the C-H bond (e.g. the allylic type oxidation of olefins). The hydrocarbon activation centre then consists of a couple Men+-O which is sometimes considered as an acid-base pair. No such electronic transfer can occur in the activation of alkanes. Still the activation of the C-H bond on oxide ions has been postulated for the ODH reactions of alkanes on V-Mg-O catalysts, in which the nucleophilicity of oxygen should be enhanced in comparison to pure vanadia by the presence of Mg. For n- butane oxidation the detection by the IR technique of very strong Lewis centres on some vanadylpyrophosphate catalyst and the correlation between the acid strength and the activity found for different vanadium containing systems (V-P-O, V-Ti-O and V-Mg-O) has led Busca et al. [10-12] to suggest that the activation of n- butane involves strong Lewis site provided by V4+ ions in the V=O groups. These centres are claimed to be capable of abstraction of a hydride ion H- with the formation of a V-H bond, like this is the case for superacid catalysed activation of alkanes. According to these authors the active centre for n-butane activation consists of a V-O very strong acid-base pair in a special environment on the 0 2 0 face of (VO)2P207, predominant on the surface of the vanadylpyrophosphate catalysts, as shown after [11] in Scheme 1. The presence of P which polarizes the V-(O-P) bond imposes strong Lewis acidity on V4+~+~ ion, this acidity being additionally enhanced by straining of V-OP bond. The latter can be induced by the disorder in stacking-fold of the 0 2 0 planes, this disorder in turn deriving from a particular preparation method. A concerted attack of both Lewis acid and base centres leads to abstraction of two hydrogen atoms and formation of adsorbed butene. Courtine (cf. this issue) points out that a V=O2+ unit constitutes a hard acid apt to react with hard bases (alkanes). The possibility of formation of V-H bond in I /o lIb''''6-\" P / \\ Scheme 1. 414 B, Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 the activation of n-butane on (VO)2P207 has also been considered by Pepera et al. [13], V4+/dl/being viewed as a \"transition metal radical\" of medium activity capable of abstracting selectively a hydrogen atom from the methylenic group in n-butane. The question of abstracting of a hydrogen atom by a metal cation in oxide systems - an essential problem in hydrocarbon conversion on transition metal oxides - is still an open subject, and mainly the matter of speculations. The only case in which the presence of Me-H bond has been shown experimentally by the IR technique is provided by the works of Kokes et al. [ 14] concerned with adsorption of hydrogen and hydrocarbons on ZnO. One could ask whether really the V4+ centres can be considered as superacids and expect that the V5+ in VOPO4 should be even stronger acid, which has not been reported so far. The reported in [12] differences in acid strengths between the V-P-O, V-Ti-O and V-Mg-O seem very small (the shift in the pyridine-Lewis centre bond frequency is only 6 cm-1) to constitute a proof for a Lewis centre being essential in the alkane oxidation. It should also be mentioned that the quantum chemical calculations by Witko et al. show no affinity of V ions in VOx clusters to form a V-H bond, no energy minimum being observed when hydrogen atoms approaches the V atom in the cluster [ 15]. On the other hand the same authors show preferential formation of the C-O bonds when an n-butane molecule approaches a cluster modelling the vanadium pyrophosphate [ 16]. The oxygen atoms in the hydrogenated precursor of MA which is formed are derived both from V=O (cyclic oxygen) and P-O (oxygen in C-O groups of MA) units. The abstraction of hydrogen from such a precursor which should follow is not, however, considered by these authors as yet. The possibility of the activation of a C-H bond by electrophilic atomic or molecular oxygen species has also been envisaged. Volta and Abon (this issue) and Chaar et al. [17] propose a couple V4+-O- as an active centre for a butane or propane activation. Such a couple could be formed by a charge transfer of the type V5+-~O2-+~-V4+-~O-. It can be recalled that such a transfer induced photoche- mically was shown earlier by Kazansky [18] for vanadia deposited on silica catalysts. It cannot be excluded that the process can occur also by thermal excitation. The O- species has been indeed shown to be active in activation of the C-H bond both in alkane and olefin molecules [ 19,20]. For the V-P-O catalysts Grasselli et al. [21] suggested, on the other hand, that a oxygen molecule chemisorbed on V4+ sites in form of superoxo oxygen species reacts with a C-H bond in an n-butane molecule to give a surface bound hydroperoxy group. The alkyl radical formed is bound at the same time to the adjacent vanadyl group to give a surface bound alkoxy group. The hydroperoxy group is then active in the abstraction of another hydrogen from the alkoxygroup. The suggestion of Grasselli et al. is based on the fact that when nitrous oxide, a source of atomic oxygen, is used as an oxidant, the activity of the catalyst decreases drastically. The species bound to the catalyst surface after the abstraction of hydrogen atoms can desorb (olefins or dienes in the case of the ODH reactions) or B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 415 undergo further reaction with an insertion of oxygen atoms forming the oxygenated products. The \"fate\" of these species depends on: (a) the number of oxygen atoms in their vicinity and the ease of the extraction of these atoms from the catalyst, and (b) the desorption rate of the olefinic or dienic product, formed after the hydrogen abstraction. It has been suggested that isolated VOx units on supports are selective in the ODH reactions whereas formation of the oxygenated products requires the presence of VOx clusters having the V-O-V-O chains (see the paper by Blasco and L6pez Nieto and by B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz). If the number of easily removable oxygens around an adsorbed organic species is too high, the overoxidation with formation of carbon oxides is possible. Grasselli and Callahan [22] have formulated the \"site isolation\" principle which requires that clusters of sites containing active oxygen should be isolated to prevent easy diffusion of oxygen to the organic ad-species. Such a separation can be realized for instance in the vanadium compounds e.g. magnesium orthovanadate or metavanadate Mg3VeOs and MgV206, in which the VOx units are separated by the MgOx polyhedra or in vanadyl pyrophosphate(VO)2P207 in which VOx units are isolated in clusters of four by pyrophosphate groups. This principle is helpful for explanation of the data obtained and it does not permit, however, to predict a size of a VO, cluster for a given reaction. As discussed by M.C. Kung and H.H. Kung in their paper in this issue, in the ODH of alkanes the larger molecules (e.g. butane as compared with propane) can interact with several VOx units in the same cluster. The selectivity will then be different for organic molecules of different size. Another factor besides the number of oxygen atoms is the rate of diffusion of oxygen in the catalyst lattice relative to the residence time of organic species on the catalyst surface. High mobility of oxygen ions which helps to replenish the oxygen vacancies formed on insertion of oxygen into an organic species and a long residence time of the latter species would lead to products of higher number of oxygen, and eventually to formation of carbon oxides. The residence time of an organic species will depend, on the other hand, on the desorption rate of intermediate products formed on the surface. The ease of desorption of an organic compound depends on acido-basic properties of the catalyst surface, the basic molecules (olefins dienes) being less strongly bound and thus more easily desorbed from the catalysts which show low acidity and high basicity, whereas for fast desorption of acidic products high acidity and low basicity is required [23]. This hypothesis is well supported by the results obtained for the vanadia-based catalysts: the lowering of the acidity of vanadia phase by depositing it on supports of basic character (see the paper by Blasco and Lopez Ni6to), or by doping with the alkali metals [1] is well correlated with the increased selectivity in the ODH reaction of propane. The increase in the selectivity to propene with the increase in nucleophilicity (basicity) of oxygen in V-Mg-O catalysts has also been observed [24], the latter parameter being estimated from the BE of 0 ls level in the XPS spectra of the catalysts. 416 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409--420 On the other hand, the V-P-O catalysts selective in MA formation show high acidity and low basicity (Abort and Volta in this issue). In oxidation reactions in which aromatic nucleus is broken (benzene, polycyclic aromatics oxidation) the activated adsorption may involve formation of electron- donor complexes with the participation of 7r electrons of a hydrocarbon molecules. VS+centres have been proposed as the electron accepting cations (cf. Briickner and Baerns this issue), the activity of the reaction being dependent on the Lewis acidity. Some general remark can be made, however, in this place. The correlations between the activity and the Lewis acidity measured by the adsorption of bases such as ammonia or pyridine do not constitute a proof for the acceptance of an electron pair by a V5+ centre and the heterolytic fission of bonds in a hydrocarbon molecules. The vanadium cations which exhibit the Lewis acid properties in the interaction with ammonia or pyridine may accept only one electron (V5+ ions) or behave even as a one electron donor centre (V4+ cations) forming homolytic bonds as proposed by Pepera [13], when a hydrocarbon molecule (much weaker base) is interacting with them. To perform a breaking of an aromatic nucleus a V5+ cation should be surrounded by several oxygens which facilitate an abstraction of hydrogens with a rupture of an aromatic ring. This is confirmed by the fact that isolated VOx centres dispersed on supports are not active in oxidation of benzene (cf. B. Grzybowska and references therein). The origin of oxygen which is incorporated into a hydrocarbon molecule is a matter of a debate. The Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism has been claimed in several cases, the kinetic equations obtained being analogous to that obtained on the basis of a two-step redox mechanism proposed by these authors. Other kinetic equations e.g. of Langmuir-Hishelwood type have also been reported. Moreover the fulfilling of the Mars and Van Krevelen kinetic equation is not necessarily a proof of the participation of the lattice oxygen in the reaction, as claimed in their original paper. The same equations are obtained when chemisorbed (and not lattice) oxygen is assumed to be involved in the redox mechanism. Both lattice and chemisorbed oxygen have been claimed as a source of oxygen in maleic anhydride from n-butane oxidation (cf. paper by Abon and Volta and references therein). In the absence of oxygen in the gas phase no formation of phthalic anhydride from o-xylene [25,26], or maleic anhydride from toluene [26] have been observed. On the other hand, in the same conditions o-tolualdehyde and benzaldehyde from o-xylene and toluene have been observed, indicating that these products can be formed with the participation of the lattice oxygen. It can be recalled that similar phenomenon has been observed in oxidation of propene on Co--Mo--O catalysts [27]: acrolein was formed with the lattice oxygen, whereas the acrylic acid formation required the presence of the gaseous oxygen. The necessity of the presence of the gaseous oxygen to obtain the more oxygenated products: organic acids and anhydrides seems then to be a general requirement. B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 417 It could also be remembered in this place that it is the lattice oxygen (from the vanadyl groups in vanadium pyrophosphate) which has been proposed as the one which is inserted into an adsorbed dienic intermediate in n-butane oxidation, to form the hydrogenated furan-like species [21 ]. The quantum chemical calculations seem to confirm such a supposition [16,28]. It appears that it is again a question of successive oxygen atoms to be inserted into the cyclic furan-like intermediate with the formation of C=O bonds in MA, which is disputable; Gleaves et al. [29] and Grasselli [21 ] suggested the adsorbed dioxygen for this step, whereas Volta (cf. this issue) claims that for the equilibrated, activated VO2P207 the lattice oxygen is the only source of oxygen in the MA molecule. The observation that the formation of acidic products requires the presence of gaseous oxygen does not necessarily imply that it is the chemisorbed oxygen which is inserted into an organic molecule. It has been suggested that gaseous oxygen is needed only to facilitate the desorption of the strongly bound oxygenated products which occurs simultaneously with the reoxidation of the surface (conjugate oxidation mechanism) [26]. Such a hypothesis seems logical since the reoxidation of the reduced catalyst, involving oxidation of V4+, V3+ ions to V5+, would lead to an increase of the catalyst acidity and a decrease of the basicity, a condition for easy desorption of acidic products. Reoxidation of vanadia-based catalysts comprises chemisorption of an oxygen molecule and its dissociation with the electron transfer according to the overall reaction: O2+4e---,202-. One of the possible detailed schemes for this reaction can be written as 02 f+ 02 -~ 20- ~ 202- The reoxidation (and chemisorption of oxygen) involves then reduced vanadium ions V4+ or V3+ which could provide the necessary electrons. The stoichiometric VaO5 does not chemisorb the oxygen. Bielafiski and Najbar (cf. this issue) propose that several (at least two) reduced vanadium ions in the vicinity are necessary for dissociative chemisorption of an oxygen molecule. The separation of the reduced centres, e.g. on the supports would then favour the presence of molecular electrophilic oxygen. These species favour the total oxidation of olefins and other electron 7r-systems by addition across the double bond and formation of oxo- or peroxo-compounds. The latter may decompose with the formation of COx. A question arises which of the oxygen atoms exposed to the surface of vanadia- based catalysts can be inserted into a hydrocarbon molecule. The role of V=O groups in selective oxidation reactions has been stressed in several papers. The fact that some active and selective catalysts do not contain these units (e.g. V-Mg-O system or some V-Mo-O catalysts) indicate, however, that their presence is not a necessary condition for the oxidation reaction on vanadia-based catalysts. The V=O groups can be active in the rupture of C-H bonds, as it can be inferred from the activity of V=O groups on supports in dehydrogenation reactions (cf. Grzy- 418 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 bowska in this issue) and from the results of quantum chemical calculations, though the same calculations show that stronger OH bond is formed for the bridging oxygen (cf. Witko and Haber in this issue). On the other hand, their participation in the insertion step can be questioned, the oxygen in terminal V-O bonds being the most strongly bound oxygen species in the vanadia system. The oxygen-18 labelling of the V-O bond provides an experimental proof for its stability (cf. Wachs et al. in this issue): the exchange time is according to these authors 20 times longer than the reaction time for n-butane oxidation. On the other hand, the bridging oxygens in chains V-O-V or V-O-Me\"+ are less strongly bound and seem more probable as the species are active in the insertion step. The insertion of the chemisorbed oxygen species has also been considered, in particular in formation of more oxidized products such as acids and anhydrides, as discussed earlier in this paper. One would expect, moreover, that the oxygen atoms surrounding a V5+ ions are more active in the insertion step as compared with those in the vicinity of V4+ ions, the V5+-O bond being weaker than the V4+-O in the same environment. Other centres beside V-O units on the surface of vanadia-based catalysts are acid Br6nsted sites in OH groups exposed to the surface. Although their presence has been shown in many cases by the IR spectroscopy of the adsorbed bases, the role of these centres in the catalytic reactions remains to be solved. The Br6nsted acidic centres may be involved in side reactions parallel to the main selective oxidation route, in particular the addition of protons to hydrocarbons may lead to typical acidic reactions e.g. cracking via the carbenium ion route, the broken fragments of initial molecules being easily oxidized to COx [30]. As suggested by Busca [12] the surface hydroxygroups containing weak Brrnsted acid site may add to olefins yielding e.g. sec-butoxy species, which - in further transformation involving oxidative dehydrogenation - can undergo a C-C bond cleavage. The direct participation of protons in the selective reactions scheme has been proposed in [21] for n-butane oxidation. The role of the Brrnsted acidic centres in vanadia catalysts remains one of the important problems to be clarified. In particular the concentration of such centres under the reaction conditions is not known. At the temperatures usually used in the oxidation reactions the equilibrium, hydration- dehydration should be shifted towards the removal of the OH groups and formation of unsaturated, active centres e.g. the strained V-O-V bridges, or even to the reduction of the catalyst. The discussion on the type of centres which can be present on the surface of vanadia-based catalysts and on their role in particular steps of the oxidation reactions presented above is very incomplete and represents a simplified approach of static catalyst surface. It is, however, generally recognized that a catalyst in the course of the reaction and/or during the activation is a dynamic system in which various centres may be formed or disappear involving diffusion phenomena within the catalyst and on its surface and an electron transfer. The approach presented above cannot account, moreover, for several phenomena reported for vanadia B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 409-420 419 catalysts. It is not clear for instance why the multiphasic systems e.g. the mixture of magnesium vanadates, are more active and selective than individual single compounds, or what is the exact role of single oxides present in mixture with vanadium compounds e.g. antimonates, solid solutions of Mo in V205, or Fe203 in iron vanadates. The concepts of coherent phase boundaries proposed by Courtine (cf. this issue) or a spill-over of oxygen between the different phases suggested by Delmon [31] are so far the only attempts to answer this question. It is for the readers of this issue to judge to what extent the papers presented here have answered the question formulated in the preface: \"what is so special in the vanadia-based catalysts\". The striking feature of these catalysts is in the first place their capability of formation of oxygenated, acidic type products. It is interesting to observe that heterogenous catalysts based on molybdenum oxide MOO3, widely used in numerous industrial processes are not capable of performing the aldehyde- acid/acidic anhydride step. In oxidation of o-xylene for instance tolualdehyde and not phthalic anhydride is the main reaction product even at relatively high conversions [32,33]. Moreover for the same reaction catalysts containing MoO3 are usually active at higher temperatures than vanadia-based catalysts. In the author's opinion the differences may arise from: (a) lower reducibility of MoO3 as compared with V205, the Taman temperatures i.e. the mobility of the lattice of the latter oxide being lower, (b) the differences in redox potentials of the VS+/V4+ and Mo6+/Mo5+ couples, which controls the oxidation state of vanadium or molyb- denum in a hydrocarbon/oxygen mixture. Vanadium ions in different oxidation states, the presence of which is characteristic of vanadia catalysts facilitate the electron transfer between the substrates of oxidation reactions and a catalyst. The molybdena-based catalysts in working conditions are, on the other hand, usually fully oxidized, only traces of molybdenum ions of valency lower than 6 being observed. This prevents the existence of the chemisorbed oxygen species in the vicinity of the reacting molecule which may be a condition of formation of the acidic products, (c) higher acidity and lower basicity of Mo catalysts as compared with the V-based catalysts (e.g. [1]), Mo6+ being more electronegative than V5+ or V4ions: the high acidity and low basicity of Mo catalysts would facilitate the desorption of adsorbed species already at the stage of formation of aldehyde-like intermediate before it can react further to form an acid or an anhydride.
