Graphical abstract The mesoporous molecular sieves Al-MCM-41 and SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 with different Si/Al=21, 42 and 83 were synthesized under hydrothermal and impregnation conditions, respectively, using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactants as template in the absence of auxiliary organics. The mesoporous materials were characterized using several sophisticated instrumental techniques [M. Selvaraj, P.K. Sinha, K.S. Seshadri, A. Pandurangan, Appl. Catal. A: Gen., 265 (2004) 75]. The materials have been used as catalyst for synthesis of diphenylmethane (DPM) using benzene and benzyl chloride (BC) in various optimal conditions. Further the catalytic results were compared with those obtained by using 0.8N sulfuric acid, different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, HY, Hβ, HM and H-ZSM-5 zeolites. The recyclable SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) catalyst exclusively forms the product DPM and has much higher yields than other solid acid catalysts. . Highly selective synthesis of diphenylmethane (DPM) was carried out by Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene using benzyl chloride (BC) as alkylating agent in the presence of a flow of nitrogen under liquid phase reaction conditions over novel mesoporous SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios. For these reactions, the influences of various reaction parameters, such as different catalysts, reaction temperature, time, mmol ratios of reactants and recyclability are discussed. With increasing the Si/Al ratios of SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 catalysts from 21 to 83, the conversion of BC and selectivity of DPM decreased because the number of Lewis acid sites in SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 catalysts are found to decrease almost linearly with increasing ratios of Si/Al. Further the catalytic results were compared with those obtained by using 0.8N sulfuric acid, different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, HY, Hβ, HM and H-ZSM-5 zeolites. From the comparison of the results, SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is found to be a highly active and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the highly selective synthesis of DPM. Thus, the selectivity of DPM in SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is higher than that in other SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al=42 and 83), Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al=21, 42 and 83), HY, Hβ, HM and H-ZSM-5. Keywords SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 Zeolites Catalytic activity Acidity Recyclability conversion of BC Selectivity of DPM 1 Introduction Diphenylmethane (DPM) is considered important for its use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries [1]. They have been prepared typically by Friedel–Crafts benzylation reaction in liquid phase using strong Lewis acids, such as AlCl3, FeCl3 and ZnCl2 as catalysts [2]. These catalysts pose number of considerable problems in handling and disposal coming from the large amount of acidic effluents and difficulties in product isolation. Thus, there has been a strong need for the replacement of the homogeneous catalysts mentioned above by reusable and easily separable catalysts, i.e. heterogeneous solid catalysts having high activity in Friedel–Crafts type reactions. Earlier studies [3,4] on the highly acidic solid catalysts, such as the HY and H-ZSM-5 zeolites, showed poor benzylation reactivity and selectivity of DPM due to the diffusion limitation caused by the microporous networks. The discovery of mesoporous material such as MCM-41 [5] has greatly extended the applicability of porous materials for catalysts in various organic reactions. Unfortunately, the acid strength of the MCM-41 resembles that of the amorphous silica-alumina rather than that of the more strongly acidic zeolite [6]. Several approaches have been proposed to increase the Lewis [7] and Bronsted acid [8,9] strength of the MCM-41. Selvaraj et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 with different Si/Al ratios for the production of neroline [10], dypnone [7] and 2-acetyl-6-methoxynaphthalene [11]. The catalysts were found to have higher surface areas, catalytic activities and reusability. Some researchers reported the synthesis of DPM over the mesoporous AlCl3/Si-MCM-41 [12] and sulfated ZrO2 [13]. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in developing processes with minimum environmental threats and maximum economic benefits. In that sense, a great demand to develop highly selective heterogeneous catalyst with large number of Lewis acid sites under mild reaction conditions without employing toxic materials. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the heterogeneously catalysed Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene over SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41. Herein we disclose a first time report on a DPM synthesis using novel SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 catalysts under the liquid-phase reaction conditions. The catalytic results are correlated and compared for 0.8N (N-normal) sulfuric acid solution and other solid catalysts such as different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, HY, Hβ, HM and H-ZSM-5. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and physicochemical characterization of Al-MCM-41 and SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 The mesoporous Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al=21, 42 and 83) was synthesized using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) as template under hydrothermal conditions and also characterized using several sophisticated instrumental techniques according to the published method by Selvaraj et al [8,9]. The SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) was prepared by impregnating 1g of the calcined Al-MCM-41 with 50mL of sulfuric acid (0.8N) with stirring at 500rpm for 3h in room temperature [10]. Then the sample was dried at 110°C for 12h. While the different SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 materials were synthesized in a similar manner using different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, 0.1 and 4N of sulfuric acid. 2.2 Commercial catalytic materials Hβ (Si/Al=20, Strem), HY (Si/Al=2.9, PQ), H-mordenite (Si/Al=20, PQ) and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=30, PQ) were obtained from commercial sources. These catalysts were then calcined at 500°C in air for 6h before catalytic reaction. 2.3 Catalytic reaction Synthesis of DPM was carried out in a 100mL round-bottomed (RB) flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer under liquid phase reaction conditions. In a typical reaction procedure, benzene was mixed with BC and 0.2g of catalyst in the presence of a flow of nitrogen in the RB. The mixture was then vigorously stirred for the desired time at different temperature. After the reaction, the samples was withdrawn periodically and analyzed by a Hewlett-Packard 6890 Gas Chromatograph fitted a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (50m×0.2mm) with methyl silicon gum. The products were confirmed by GC–MS. 2.4 Experimental for recyclable catalysts After the initial use, the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 usually suffers from the activity loss and hence the catalyst needs to be regenerated by calcination. In contrast, SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 is excellent catalyst for the Friedel–Crafts benzylation of benzene to DPM. It can be recycled by washing with dichloromethane and ethyl acetate at 40°C followed by hot water to remove the organics and unreacted reactants. It was dried at 140°C overnight. Further the catalyst was washed at five times in a similar procedure. The recycled SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 catalyst was again prepared with a similar manner. 2.5 Leaching of sulfate experiment studies from SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 After the catalyst reaction, catalyst was equilibrated with distilled water for 1 week at 100°C (pH<5), and kept in water bath and the supernatant was checked for SO4 2− with barium chloride using Nephelometer (Elico Limited, India). The experiment was repeated to verify reproducibility before reporting the results. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical properties of SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 The XRD patterns of both the Al-MCM-41 and SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 showed (Fig. 1 ) well-resolved reflections typical of the mesoporous MCM-41 structure [9,10]. The surface area, pore size and pore volume was estimated by the BET and BJH method using N2-adsorption measurements, and the results are shown in Table 1 . Impregnation of the Al-MCM-41 with sulfuric acid resulted in the decreased crystallinity, d-spacing, unit cell parameter, surface area and pore diameter [10]. Particularly, the mesoporous structure in the high sulfate-containing Al-MCM-41 (4N-H2SO4 impregnated Al-MCM-41(21)) was collapsed [10]. We have concluded the following from the solid state NMR results (Fig. 2 ): (1) upon impregnation of SO4 2− ion in the Al-MCM-41, the octahedral coordination of Al3+ ion became non-framework on the silica surface because of the SO4 2− ion which are bonded to Si(IV) and (2) the strong Lewis acid sites were generated on the surface of the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 due to the inductive effect of the sulfate group in the presence of octahedral aluminum ions (Fig. 3 ) from the sulfuric acid impregnation [10]. Above results (Lewis acid sites) were reconfirmed by the FTIR-pyridine analyses [10], and the results are shown in Table 2 . While the uniformity of the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 pore size was verified with TEM images [11], and pore size and hexagonal symmetry of the all sulfate-containing MCM-41 was found to be smaller than those of the Al-MCM-41 due to non-framework aluminum caused by impregnation of sulfate-ions [7]. 3.2 Synthesis of DPM The Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene using BC as alkylating agent in the presence of a flow of nitrogen for the synthesis of DPM (Fig. 4 ) was carried out with different optimal conditions such as different catalysts, reaction temperature, time, mmol ratios of reactants and recyclability reactions, and the all results are discussed below. 3.3 Effect of different catalysts for synthesis of DPM The Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene using BC in the presence of a flow of nitrogen for the synthesis of DPM was carried out over H-ZSM-5, HM, Hβ, HY, Al-MCM-41(21), Al-MCM-41(42), Al-MCM-41(83), SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21), SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(42), SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(83) and 0.8N H2SO4 as catalysts and their results are shown in Table 3 . The order of catalytic activity for the selectivity of DPM was found to be SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21)>SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(42)>SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(83)>HY>Al-MCM-41(21)>Hβ>Al-MCM-41(42)>Al-MCM-41(83)>0.8N H2SO4 >HM>H-ZSM-5. Above results on the catalyst acid strength is based on the FTIR and TPD analysis of the adsorbed pyridine [10,14,15]. The mesoporous SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) (pore size=25.9Å), SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(42) (pore size=26.3Å) and SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(83) (pore size=27.4Å) shows high catalytic activity for the formation of high selectivity of DPM in room temperature with no diffusional constraint. But the selectivity of DPM in the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is higher than that of other SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 due to the higher number of acid sites on its surface by increasing octahedral aluminum [10]. When Al-MCM-41 was impregnated with 0.8N H2SO4, the selectivity of DPM increased from 48.1 to 99.1mol%, a much higher value than the case of using sulfuric acid solution (64.2%, BC conversion) itself as a catalyst at room temperature. This indicates that the sulfuric acid modification of the Al-MCM-41(21) enhances both catalytic activity and catalyst acidity. In order to verify this, the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) was first stirred and washed in de-ionized water and then the filtrate was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The resulting filtrate was found to contain aluminum cation. Furthermore, the resulting catalyst exhibited a significant decrease in BC conversion, from 99.1 to 40.1%. We believe that the non-framework aluminum existing in the intrachannel space is supposed to increase the catalyst activity due to the increase of Lewis acidity [10]. The BC conversion and DPM selectivity of the 0.8N H2SO4-sulfated Al-MCM-41(21) was higher than those of the 0.1N and 4N H2SO4-sulfated Al-MCM-41(21) due to the higher catalytic activity. But, the selectivity was found to be very lower for the 4N H2SO4-sulfated Al-MCM-41(21) because of the collapsed pore structure of the catalyst (Table 3). A very low percentage of conversion and selectivity was observed at room temperature (27°C) for 8h (the values are not shown in Table 3) over different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, HY, HM and H-ZSM-5, but, the selectivity is found to be higher for reactions at 80°C for 6h exhibiting the values (selectivity) in the following order: HY>Al-MCM-41(21)>Hβ>Al-MCM-41(42)>Al-MCM-41(83)>HM>H-ZSM-5 as shown in Table 3. The conversion and selectivity in Al-MCM-41(21) is higher than that in other Al-MCM-41 catalysts due to the higher number acid sites on its surface. Zeolite Hβ is found to be more active (63.1% BC conversion) compared to the HY (56.3% BC conversion). However, in terms of selectivity, Hβ is found to be less selective (55.3%) than HY (65.3%) in the reaction. The higher selectivity of HY might be explained on the basis of its strong acidity and slightly larger pore opening size (7.4Å) than Hβ (7.6, 5.4Å) while geometrical constraints produced by Hβ did not allow the formation of bulkier products in the small channels, and, hence a higher selectivity of DPM is achieved over HY rather than Hβ zeolite. HM and H-ZSM-5, in spite of its strong acidity achieved by several researchers, but, it is found to be less active in the reaction. The small pore size of the HM (7.1Å) and H-ZSM-5 (5.4Å) zeolites imposes diffusion control through which the bulky product DPM cannot diffuse out with the formation of the small amount of the product probably through a surface reaction. From the comparison of all catalytic results, SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is found to be a highly active and novel heterogeneous catalyst for the highly selective synthesis of DPM at room temperature for 4h. It is evident that the pore size and acid strength of the catalyst plays a major role during the synthesis of DPM, a large molecule while the important relation is between pore size and molecular size of the reactant/product. The pore size of the catalyst must be accessible to reactant and product molecules in order to take part in the reaction. Thus, the effect of temperature, time, the mmol ratios of reactants and recyclability were studied on SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21). 3.4 Effect of reaction temperature The synthesis of DPM was carried out with different reaction temperature from room temperature to 95°C with 9:1mmol ratio of BC to benzene in the presence of a flow of nitrogen for 4h over SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) catalyst and as given in Fig. 5 . The conversion of BC is to remain constant upto 85°C, but the conversion of BC at higher reaction temperature (>85°C) and also selectivity of DPM from 35 to 95°C decreased because of the formation of consecutive alkylation products (the isomers of dibenzylbenzene (DBB) such as 1,4-DBB, 1,3-DBB and 1,2-DBB). From the above catalytic results, the optimum reaction temperature was found to be room temperature for highly selective synthesis of DPM. 3.5 Effect of reactants ratio The synthesis of DPM was carried out at room temperature with various mmol ratios of reactants for 4h in the presence of a flow of nitrogen over SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21), and the results are shown in Table 4 . A decrease in conversion of BC and selectivity of DPM was observed at 1:1, 1:2 and 5:2mmol ratio of BC to benzene. This may be due to insufficient quantity of the reactants to react with each other. But, an increase in conversion of BC and selectivity of DPM was observed in the 9:1mmol ratio of BC to benzene at the same reaction conditions. This may be due to equilibrating of each reactant quantity on the acid sites of the inner side surface of catalyst. Further experiments were carried out and also reconfirmed to obtain DPM with maximum selectivity as shown in Table 4. 3.6 Effect of reaction time The variation of reaction time on the Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene was studied in the range of 1–10h at room temperature with 9:1mmol ratio of BC to benzene over SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21), and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion of BC and selectivity of DPM increased with increasing reaction time upto 4h because the contact time is decreased between reactants and active sites of the catalyst. Further the reaction time is increased; the conversion is to remain constant, but the selectivity of DPM decreased because of the formation of consecutive alkylation products (the isomers of dibenzylbenzene (DBB) such as 1,4-DBB, 1,3-DBB and 1,2-DBB) due to very high contact time. From the above results, the optimum reaction time was found to be 4h for highly selective synthesis of DPM. 3.7 Recyclability of the catalysts SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) and SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(83) catalysts was reused for the Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 4h with 9:1mmol ratio of BC to benzene for the highly selective synthesis of DPM, and the results have been depicted in Fig. 7 . No loss of catalytic activity and Al-ions were observed after 4 runs in SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21). Instead, its conversion of BC and selectivity of DPM is to remain constant with each cycling SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21). But, the conversion and selectivity decreased only in SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(83) with each cycling at the same reaction conditions. This may be due to decreasing the catalytic activity along with acid sites on the surface of the catalyst. It was verified that the reaction did not occur in the absence of catalyst. Also, the sulfate ion in recycled samples confirmed that SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 was resistant to leaching under reaction conditions tested in this study. 3.8 Leaching of sulfate from SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41 From the experiments on leaching studies carried out using SO4 2− impregnated Al-MCM-41 it was observed no leaching of SO4 2− from the catalyst after the catalytic reaction. 4 Conclusions The synthesis of DPM was carried out over Al–MCM-41, SO4 2−/Al–MCM-41, 0.8N H2SO4 and different types of zeolites as catalysts. A decrease in BC conversion and DPM selectivity in the Al-MCM-41 and SO4 2−/Al–MCM-41 was observed with increasing Si/Al ratios at different reaction temperature. Further the conversion and selectivity results were compared with those obtained by using 0.8N sulfuric acid, 0.1N and 4N H2SO4-sulfated Al-MCM-41(21), different Si/Al ratios of Al-MCM-41, HY, Hβ, HM and H-ZSM-5 zeolites. From the comparison of the results, finally, SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is found to be a highly active and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst when it is compared to the above catalyst for the highly selective synthesis of DPM. In the context, the SO4 2−/Al-MCM-41(21) is found to be more suitable for the Friedal–Crafts benzylation of benzene to highly selective synthesis of DPM.
