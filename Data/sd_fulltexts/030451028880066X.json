Activity tests were carried out at 400 C using a micropulse reactor and hydrogen- containing carrier gas. Depending on the reactant and the catalyst, either hydrogenolysis or dehydrogenation was prevalent. Hydrogenolysis of n- heptane and 2,2-dimethylbutane occurred over all catalysts, indicating that under the reaction conditions the rhenium existed as larger groupings of rhenium metal atoms and not as isolated monomeric rhenium complexes. Thus the originally well-dispersed rhenium underwent migration to finally form small rhenium clusters. Highest hydrogenolysis activity was observed for the titania-supported rhenium catalysts. Silica- and alumina-supported rhenium exhibited selective dehydrogenation of cyclopentane and methyl- cyclopentane to cyclopentene and methylcyclopentene, respectively. On the titania-supported rhenium, hydrogenolysis was the dominant reaction ob- served with cyclopentane and methylcyclopentane. Introduction Because of rhenium's importance in industrial petrochemical reforming and metathesis [1, 2] and rhenium's continually emerging properties in homogeneous catalysis [3, 4], interest has developed in its possible proper- ties as a supported organometallic. The dinuclear rhenium carbonyl Re2(CO)io has already been supported on both silica and 7-alumina [5]. The catalytic activity of Re2(CO)io was not studied; however, spectroscopic work revealed that the surface species was mononuclear after reaction-deposition onto the surfaces. Kirlin et al. [6, 7] undertook both catalytic and spectroscopic studies of the mono- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/88/$3.60 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 346 nuclear species Re(CO)5Br and HRe(CO)5 supported on magnesium oxide and 7-alumina, as well as of the trimer H3Re3(CO)i2 on magnesium oxide and 7-alumina. These studies strongly suggested that the mononuclear spe- cies remain isolated on the surfaces, and that a surface trimeric species could be made, at least in the case of H3Re3(CO)i2 supported on magnesium oxide. Further, hydrogenation but no hydrogenolysis could be effected on the monomeric catalysts, whereas hydrogenolysis of cyclopropane occurred on the trimeric magnesium oxide-supported catalysts. This result lends support to the hypothesis of ensemble activity, particularly as it relates to current theories of hydrogenolysis activity [8]. With this rather extensive spectroscopic data already available and con- vincing yet still preliminary data on the catalytic activity of supported rhenium clusters, further studies seemed in order, in particular as regards the activity of supported rhenium clusters during standard high temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Therefore, we have undertaken to attach the cluster H3Re3(CO)i2 to three inorganic supports (silica, 7-alumina and titania) and to study their hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis activities. This study did not assume that the supported cluster catalysts would remain intact at the temperatures and under the conditions of the catalysis studied. However, given the prior spectroscopic evidence that well-defined rhenium centers can definitely be created on some surfaces, a study of the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis activity of extremely dispersed rhenium (per- haps even intact rhenium ensembles) prepared by cluster decomposition appeared worthwhile. Experimental Materials For catalyst preparation, the rhenium was purchased as Re2(CO)io (Strem). The inorganic oxide supports were Aerosil 200 silica (Degussa), C- alumina (Degussa) and P-25 titania (Degussa) containing 65% anatase and 35% rutile. The reagents 2,2-dimethylbutane, n-heptane, cyclopentane and methyl cyclopentane, were purchased from Fluka AG. The helium, nitrogen and hydrogen (99.999% purity) used in the studies were from Pan Gas Luzern. Preparation of supported clusters The hydridocarbonyl cluster H3Re3(CO)i2 was synthesized from Rc2- (C0)i2 according to the literature procedure [9]. Spectra of the recrystal- lized complex gave clean infrared bands at the appropriate wavenumbers 2093, 2030, 2008 and 1983 cm\"1, which are characteristic of the complex. All operations were carried out under inert nitrogen atmosphere. The oxide supports were first formed, dried, crushed and sieved to a 0.5 -1.0 mm mesh. They were then chemically modified prior to the reac- 347 tion-deposition of the organorhenium cluster. Two different types of mod- ified surfaces were prepared. In method (A) [10], 2-6 g of the oxide support were dehydroxylated under flowing oxygen at atmospheric pressure, 30 ml (STP) per min and 600 C in a quartz flow-through reactor. After 24 h, the supports were cooled under flowing oxygen to room temperature. The samples were then transfer- red to a Schlenk tube, evacuated and stored under nitrogen. This procedure was absolutely necessary in the case of titania, as failure to cool the samples under oxygen gave rise to a characteristic darkening of the sample indicative of Ti3\"*\" ions [11] and thus a far more reactive acidic surface [12]. In method (B) [13], a previously dehydroxylated oxide support was further modified by refluxing in anhydrous methanoi for 24 h under nitro- gen. Afterwards, the methanoi was decanted and the samples evacuated for 4 h and stored under nitrogen. This procedure of esterification is known to occur with the silanol and siloxane groups on silica [14, 15], on y-alumina [16] and on various phases of titania [17]. Esterification should further eliminate some of the more reactive centers on the surface. The thermal dehydroxylation of the supports should have decreased the hydroxyl-group concentrations [18] on all the supports to levels below 4 OH nm\"2. By using both dehydroxylation and esterification, the low density of reactive centers on the oxide surfaces should help maximize the chance of obtaining isolated rhenium centers after reaction with the metal complex. To a 100 ml solution of n-heptane and 45 mg of the rhenium complex H3Re3(CO)i2 sufficient inorganic oxide support, prepared by either method (A) or (B), was added to insure a maximum metal loading of 0.1 complex per nm2. This meant approximately 1.5 g silica, 3 g 7-alumina and 6 g titania were used, given that the determined BET areas were 193, 101, and 54 m2 g~1, respectively, for these supports. This corresponded to rhenium metal loadings of 1.8, 0.9 and 0.45 wt.%. The heptane was then refluxed under nitrogen, and infrared spectra were made periodically of the solution. The n- heptane was allowed to reflux until no carbonyls could be detected in solu- tion. In the case of Degussa-C and Aerosil 200, the IR spectra of the solution showed only the presence of the parent complex H3Re3(CO)i2 throughout the reaction. As for titania, additional CO stretching frequencies were ob- served, indicating some degradation during the reaction with the surface, however the intensities of these bands were extremely weak and presumably the concentrations of other products very low. After refluxing for 3 to 70 h and with the disappearance of the carbonyls from solution, the supports which were originally white or transluscent turned bright yellow. Presumably, all the rhenium was depos- ited on the supports, as no signs of decomposition were observed on the walls of the flasks. After reaction, the heptane was decanted and the samples were evacuated for 4 h and stored under nitrogen. With the exception of the silica support, the reaction was complete after a maximum of6h. 348 Characterization of supported clusters IR spectra of both the dehydroxylated supports and the rhenium sup- ported clusters were carried out in KBr disks on a Perkin Elmer 983 IR spec- trophotometer. The KBr disks were prepared in a dry box by adding a few mg of non-air exposed support or catalyst to approximately 100 mg of dry KBr. The KBr was previously evacuated at 200 C for 24 hours. Catalytic tests The hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation activity tests of the different catalysts were performed in a tubular microreactor (i.d. 3.1 mm) which was constructed of type 316 stainless steel and which was situated in the injection block of a Hewlett Packard series 5880 autosampling gas Chroma- tograph. A section made up of l g of inert glass particles was introduced directly on top of the catalyst particles. The injection volumes of the hydro- carbons were one jul. The carrier gas was helium/hydrogen 4:1 at a flow rate of 30 ml (STP) min\"1 and a total pressure of 6 bar. Previous to the activity tests, the catalysts were activated at 400 C under the helium and hydrogen carrier at 30 ml min\"1 for 2 h. The separation column was a 10 m capillary column with 23% SP1700 packing. Blank experiments conducted with the microreactor and the glass par- ticles alone did not indicate any significant conversion at the reaction condi- tions. Cyclohexanol and 3,3-dimethyl-l-butene tests [19] were included to reveal the presence or absence of iron oxides and strong acidic sites, respec- tively. For the tests with the supported rhenium clusters, the microreactor was filled in a dry box immediately before use. The actual reaction conditions with respect to temperature, pressure and carrier flow rates were the same as in the activation step. As the supported rhenium organometallic catalysts could not be pre- weighed in our dry box, some irregularities in the sample size occurred. The sample sizes were 2.8 X 10~4, 1.2 X 10-4, 2.1 X 10~4, 2.4 X 10\"4 and 3.0 X 10~4 g rhenium for the catalyst samples later designated silica (A), alumina (A), alumina (B), titania (A) and titania (B), respectively. The relatively low amounts of catalyst were required in order to maintain absolutely isothermal conditions. Furthermore, under the low conversions, possible gas phase reactions disguising the product distribution were suppres- sed. Finally, the micropulse tests with simply the pure supports showed negligible activity for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions.

To test the stability of these catalysts toward oxygen, the catalysts were exposed for 24 h to the laboratory air and new KBr disks were made. The spectra for the silica- and titania-supported clusters remained essentially unchanged, whereas the spectra of the alumina-supported catalysts changed, giving rise to new but weak bands indicating some air sensitivity. Catalytic properties The catalysts prepared from the supported organometallic clusters were investigated with regard to their catalytic behavior, using as a test the reac- tions of n-heptane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, cyclopentane and methylcyclo- pentane.

Discussion Infrared spectroscopy of supported organometallic clusters The characteristic IR carbonyl absorbance bands observed at 2020 and ca. 1900 cm\"1 which are seen on the oxide-supported catalysts prepared 351 from H3Re3(CO)i2 are not suggestive of a trimeric species. Indeed, Kvdmet al. [7] obtained bands at 2195, 2010, 1930 and 1870 cm--1 after contacting H3Re3(CO)i2 with magnesium oxide. In this case, they proposed the for- mation of a H2Re3(CO)i2~ surface species. Instead, the spectra obtained in this study strongly suggest the formation of a Re(CO)3 moiety as the pre- dominant species on the surface. Komiyama et al. [20] found stable sets of peaks at 2030 and 1920 cm\"1 in situ and at 2010 and 1885 cm\"1 in KBr-prepared samples for titania- and zirconia-supported rhenium CO hydrogenation catalysts. However, they were not able to assign these peaks to any one species. McKenna et al. [5] obtained similar frequencies in the photolysis and subsequent deposition of Re2(CO)io. They proposed a surface species Re(CO)3 0 M from their spectroscopic studies. The species on silica gave bands at 2032 and 1935 cm\"1 and that on alumina at 2028 and 1901 cm\"1, and 2018 and 1904 cm\"1 depending on the solvent. In the monomeric work, Kirlin et al. [7] obtained IR absorption at the frequencies 2028 and 1915 cm\"1 (shoulder at 1887) for the alumina- supported species. Based on additional Raman and electron tunneling infor- mation, they concluded that the surface species was [Re(CO)3(0 Al)- (HO A1)2]. Therefore, the IR carbonyl spectra in this study are tentatively assigned to a Re(CO)3 fragment. However, given no additional spectroscopic information, a specific surface structure cannot be written. The sharp IR absorbance at 2090 in the case of the 7-alumina seen in Fig. 1 and the broad shoulders at 1980 and 1920 cm\"1 can be confidently assigned to physically adsorbed H3Re3(CO)i2. The physisorption of H3Re3- (C0)i2 on alumina was the primary mode of incorporation when contacted with an n-hexane solution in Kirlin's studies. Such spectra gave bands at 2095, 2020, 1970 (shoulder) and 1920 (shoulder) cm\"1. In this study, the physisorption seems to have been significantly reduced by refluxing in n- heptane. Some physisorption is also suggested in the case of the titania (shoulder at 1970 cm\"1), however this is not entirely conclusive, as the 2095 cm\"1 band is not seen. Catalytic properties The results of the catalytic tests summarized in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that depending on the reactant, either hydrogenolysis or dehydrogenation was the dominant reaction catalyzed by the supported rhenium catalysts. Hydrogenolysis of n-heptane and 2,2-dimethylbutane occurred over all catalysts, with the main product being methane. This is consistent with the result that hydrogenolysis of n-heptane was the primary reaction on a 2% rhenium on alumina catalyst prepared from Re207 by Tournayan et al. [21]. It is interesting to note that the titania-supported rhenium catalysts were considerably more active than the catalysts prepared with silica and alumina as the support. Whether this behavior is to be attributed to a difference in the dispersion of the rhenium clusters on the different supports or to dif- ferent metal support interaction is presently not clear. Further work will be 352 necessary to elucidate the reason for the higher hydrogenolysis activity of the titania-supported catalysts. In any case, the hydrogenolysis activity of all catalysts indicates that the rhenium exists as larger groupings of rhenium atoms and not as isolated monomeric rhenium complexes under reaction conditions. The latter would not catalyse rupture of the C C bond [8, 22]. Cyclopentane and methylcyclopentane were selectively dehydrogenated to cyclopentene and methylcyclopentene respectively, over the silica- and alumina-supported rhenium catalysts (Table 2). Conversely, with the titania- supported catalyst, hydrogenolysis remained the dominant reaction, result- ing in poor selectivities for dehydrogenation. The primary hydrogenolysis product was methane for the reactions with both cyclopentane and methyl- cyclopentane. As regards the different pretreatments (A) [10] and (B) [13] of the carriers, both pretreatments yielded catalysts with similar activity behavior in hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation. Conclusions Supported rhenium catalysts prepared by immobilization of H3Re3- (C0)i2 clusters on silica, alumina and titania were found to catalyse either hydrogenolysis or dehydrogenation when exposed to hydrocarbons in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at 400 C. Depending on the reactant hydrocarbon and on the support, either hydrogenolysis or dehydrogenation was prevalent. Silica- and alumina-supported rhenium catalyzed selectively the de- hydrogenation of cyclopentane and methylcyclopentane to cyclopentene and methylcyclopentene, respectively. With n-heptane and 2,2-dimethylbutane, hydrogenolysis was the prevalent reaction on all supported catalysts, indicating that the rhenium existed as larger groupings of rhenium atoms and not as isolated monomeric rhenium complexes. Highest hydrogenolysis activities were obtained with the titania-supported rhenium catalysts. References 1 N. Tsuda and A. Fujimori, J. Catal., 69 (1981) 420. 2 K. T.

        "dc:description": "Supported rhenium catalysts prepared by immobilization of H3Re3-(CO)12 clusters on silica, alumina and titania were tested with regard to their activity in hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Activity tests were carried out at 400 °C using a micropulse reactor and hydrogen-containing carrier gas. Depending on the reactant and the catalyst, either hydrogenolysis or dehydrogenation was prevalent. Hydrogenolysis of n-heptane and 2,2-dimethylbutane occurred over all catalysts, indicating that under the reaction conditions the rhenium existed as larger groupings of rhenium metal atoms and not as isolated monomeric rhenium complexes. Thus the originally well-dispersed rhenium underwent migration to finally form small rhenium clusters. Highest hydrogenolysis activity was observed for the titania-supported rhenium catalysts. Silica- and alumina-supported rhenium exhibited selective dehydrogenation of cyclopentane and methyl-cyclopentane to cyclopentene and methylcyclopentene, respectively. On the titania-supported rhenium, hydrogenolysis was the dominant reaction observed with cyclopentane and methylcyclopentane.",
