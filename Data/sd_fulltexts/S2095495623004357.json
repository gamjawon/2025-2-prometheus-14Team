Graphical abstract Pd@RuP core-shell nanorods were synthesized via the epitaxial growth of ultrathin RuP shells with fcc crystal structure on the (111) plane of the fcc Pd nanorods core as the efficient and stable HER electrocatalyst. Ru with Pt-like hydrogen bond strength, knockdown cost (∼1/3 of Pt), and eximious stability is a competitive replacement for Pt-based catalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting. The design of Ru-based catalysts via interface construction, crystal phase control, and specific light element doping to realize the impressive promotion of limited activity and stability remains challenging. Herein, we report the fabrication of Pd@RuP core-shell nanorods (NRs) via an epitaxial growth method, where ultrathin RuP shells extend the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and (111) plane of the Pd NRs core. Density functional theory results confirm that the core-shell interface engineering and P doping synergistically accelerate electron transfer and moderate the d-band center to generate a suitable affinity for H*, thus optimizing HER kinetics. Compared with Pd@Ru NRs and Pt/C, the Pd@RuP NRs exhibit preferable electrocatalytic stability and superior activity with a low overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in the alkaline HER process. Furthermore, the integrated Pd@RuP//RuO2-based electrolyzer also displays a low operation potential of 1.42 V to acquire 10 mA cm−2, demonstrating great potential for practical water electrolysis. Our work presents an efficient avenue to design Ru-based electrocatalysts via epitaxial growth for extraordinary HER performance. Keywords Pd@RuP Epitaxial growth Interface engineering Hydrogen evolution Electrocatalyst 1 Introduction Hydrogen energy as a renewable and carbon-free energy source is an ideal alternative to traditional fossil fuel energy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing the global warming effect [1–4]. Compared with the conventional “grey” hydrogen production, electrochemical water splitting via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been recognized as a promising low-carbon and sustainable pathway to acquire high-purity hydrogen gas [5–9]. The use of energy-efficient catalysts to boost the alkaline HER kinetics with inferior proton concentration is critical for inspiring water electrocatalysis [10–12]. Pt-based catalysts are still the reported most active HER catalysts, but the scarce reserves and exorbitant price seriously hampered the large-scale application. Thus, developing Pt-free electrocatalysts with high activity and low cost for HER is urgently desired and essential for practical hydrogen production, but remains challenging [13,14]. Ruthenium (Ru) metal with ∼1/3 cost of Pt has similar hydrogen bond strength to Pt of ∼65 kcal mol−1 and excellent stability, hence becoming the promising substitute for the noble metal Pt [15–17]. However, the activity and durability of Ru-based catalysts are still more deficient than Pt and need further greatly improvement. Various regulation strategies are developed to increase the number of active sites and ameliorate the intrinsic activity of each active site of Ru-based catalysts, including morphology regulation, crystal control, interface engineering, heteroatom doping, etc. [11,16,18–20]. Crystal phase control has been reported as an effective way to improve the activity of Ru-based catalysts [21]. It has been reported that face-centered cubic (fcc)-structured Ru usually demonstrates better electrocatalytic performance than hexagonal close-packed (hcp)-structured ones in reactions like HER, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), etc. [22–24]. However, Ru is usually crystallized in the hcp crystal phase rather than fcc one, and thus the synthesis of the fcc-structured Ru-based catalysts has become a huge puzzle [25,26]. The construction of the bimetallic Pd@Ru core-shell structure has become an efficient approach to solve this problem via the epitaxial growth of fcc Ru shell on the surface of fcc Pd cores. Xia et al. found that the fcc-Ru layer could be formed by the epitaxial deposition on the surface of fcc-Pd cubic layer as the growth seed via the template effect [27]. Zhang and co-workers also synthesized hierarchical 4H/fcc Ru nanotubes with a similar method, where 4H/fcc Au nanowires as the hard template to induce the epitaxial growth and achieve an improved alkaline HER performance [28]. The introduction of heteroatoms to form Ru-Te, Ru-O, and Ru-P compounds has also been proven as an effective way to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of Ru-based catalysts [29–31]. The introduction of heteroatoms could enhance the atomic efficiency of Ru as well as modify the electronic structure of Ru atoms via the s, p-d orbital hybridization [13]. In addition, compared with Ru oxides as a semiconductor prone to poor conductivity and metallicity, which is adverse to the electrocatalytic reaction, nonmetal P with the close electronegativity of Pd/Ru can not only provide additional p electrons to enhance electron delocalization and conductivity of Ru-based catalysts but also regulate the strength of RuP metallic bond to ameliorate the adsorption strength of H [32]. However, few experiments provided evidence for this theoretical prediction in the reported works. In this work, we propose and develop a facile template-mediate method to synthesize core-shell Pd@RuP nanorods (NRs) using the prefabricated Pd nanorods as the growing seed. During the epitaxial growth process, RuP shells extend the fcc structure and (111) plane of Pd NRs ideally via the lattice matching, which can serve as the palmary alkaline HER catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was conducted beforehand to corroborate that the core-shell interface engineering and P insertion can effectively enhance the conductivity, trigger the electron transfer on Ru sites, modify the Ru d-band center, and hence improve the HER kinetics. As verification, Pd@RuP NRs displayed commendable activity with low overpotential and improved stability in the alkaline HER, surpassing Pd@Ru NRs and even commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the self-made Pd@RuP NRs//RuO2-based electrolyzer only needs 1.42 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the commercial Pt/C//RuO2 couple, suggesting a great potential of Pd@RuP NRs for the practical application of water splitting. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and chemicals Carbonylchlorohydrotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium (RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3) and Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)2) were purchased from Shanghai D&B Biological Science and Technology Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol (EG), L-ascorbic acid (AA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, M w = 30,000) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sodium iodide (NaI) and Triphenylphosphine (C18H15P) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology. Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Sodium tetrachloropalladate(II) (Na2PdCl4) was purchased from Beijing Bailingway Technology Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C was acquired from Johnson Matthey Corporation. Deionized water (DI water, 18.2 MΩ cm−1) was employed throughout all experiments. All reagents were analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of Pd@RuP NRs (also denoted as Pd@RuP3.91% NRs) In a typical preparation of the Pd@RuP NRs, 5 mg of as-prepared Pd NRs, 50 mg of PVP, and 100 mg of AA were mixed in a 30 mL vial containing 10 mL of EG solvent. After uniform dispersion by sonication, the vial was then immersed in an oil bath held at 200 °C under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, a mixed solution of 10 mg of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 in 10 mL of EG was injected into the flask using a syringe pump at a controlled rate of 2.5 mL h−1. The reaction system was maintained at 200 °C for an additional 2 h after the injection was completed. The resulting Pd@RuP NRs were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 r min−1 for 6 min and then thoroughly washed with ethanol multiple times. Details regarding the preparation of other comparative catalysts can be found in the Supporting Information. 2.3 Characterization The morphology and composition analysis involved transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping measurements. These measurements were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained to determine the crystallinity of the samples. The measurements were performed on a Model D/max-rC X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu K α radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) and operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al K α X-ray source. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s peak energy of 284.6 eV as a reference. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were conducted using a CHI 760E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instrument, Shanghai, Chenhua Co., Ltd.) at 25 °C, employing a standard three-electrode system. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode (d = 3 mm) modified with catalysts, while a graphite rod served as the auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. To prepare the catalyst inks, 2 mg of catalysts and 2 mg of Vulcan XC-72 carbon were thoroughly dispersed in a mixed solvent comprising 0.6 mL ethanol, 0.3 mL H2O, and 0.1 mL Nafion solution, using sufficient sonication. Subsequently, 9 μL of the mixed catalyst ink was dropped onto the glassy carbon electrode to form the working electrode. HER tests were performed in a N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. All presented data were corrected for iR loss. All electrode potentials were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The RHE calibration was performed based on a method described in the literature [33]. In our electrochemical test system with 1.0 M KOH, the relationship between E(RHE) and E(SCE) is given by E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 1.07 V. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using the equation: TOF = jA/nFN, where j is the current density under a specified overpotential with iR correction, A is the geometric area of the working electrode, n is the number of electrons transferred in the HER reaction (i.e. 2), F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol−1), and N is the number of active sites (mol) calculated based on the total mass loading. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was determined from the CV curves obtained in the non-Faradaic region (1.00–1.14 V) at scan rates ranging from 40 to 160 mV s−1. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst was estimated using the equation: ECSA = C dl/C s, where C s is the specific capacitance of the catalyst (0.06 mF cm−2). To calculate the j ECSA of the catalysts, we normalized the measured current by the ECSA from the equation: j ECSA = i/ECSA, where i represents the measured current (mA), and ECSA is the ECSA value (cm2). The long-term stability was assessed by conducting chronopotentiometry at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. The accelerated durability test (ADT) was conducted in the potential range from −0.05 to 0.05 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The activation energy (E a) was determined by performing HER polarization curves at different temperatures from 10 to 40 °C. The E a value was calculated at an overpotential of 119 mV using the Arrhenius formula. 2.5 Computational details All the DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code [34,35]. The electronic exchange and correlations in the Hamiltonian term were described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [36]. The interaction between core electrons and ion species was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [37,38]. The valence electrons were described by expanding the Kohn-Sham wave functions in the form of plane-wave basis sets. The energy cutoff for all the calculations was set to 400 eV. The convergence criterion for all forces was set to be lower than 0.05 eV Å−1. The convergence for the electronic self-consistence was lower than 10−5 eV. The k-mesh for the first Brillouin zone was 4 × 4 × 4 based on the Gamma-center sampling toward the bulk structure. The electronic convergence for self-consistence was below 10−5 eV. The (111) surfaces were investigated for Pd bulk and Ru bulk structures with k-mesh of 4 × 4 × 1. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was introduced in the z direction to prevent periodic interactions. A dipole correction in the z direction was applied during the work function calculation [39]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Pd@RuP NRs The synthetic process of Pd@RuP NRs is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), which consists of the preparation of Pd NRs as the core and subsequent in-situ growth of ultrathin RuP alloy shell on the Pd NRs surface. Firstly, Pd NRs were fabricated with the reduction of Na2PdCl4 via a facile hydrothermal method using NaI as the structure-directing agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone as the surfactant and the reducing agent. As shown in Fig. S1, the large-scale TEM image and corresponding particle-size distribution reveal the uniform one-dimensional (1D) nanorod-like structure with the particle size around 5.56 nm of the as-prepared Pd NRs. Few morphologies can be observed except the nanorods, suggesting a high yield of Pd NRs. Ultrathin particle size and the 1D rod-like nanostructure endow the catalyst with abundant active sites on the surface and robust structurally catalytic stability [40,41]. Then, the Pd NRs were selected as the hard template to fabricate Pd@RuP NRs by adding RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 as the Ru and P source while AA as the reductant. For comparison, bimetallic Pd@Ru NRs were also prepared using a similar synthetic method via changing the metal precursor to the Ru(acac)2. After the complete growth of Ru or RuP alloy shells, the particle sizes of Pd@RuP (Fig. 1g and Fig. S2) and Pd@Ru NRs (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3) increase slightly with average layer thicknesses of ca. 1.19 and 1.34 nm, respectively, accompanied by the efficient retention of the ultrathin rod-like nanostructure and high product purity. Specifically, HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDX mappings were performed to identify the elemental distribution status in the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1(c), Ru elements are distributed uniformly around the Pd nanorod signals, thus proving the successful formation of the Pd@Ru core-shell structure. Similarly, we can also observe the well-defined Pd@RuP core-shell structure from Fig. 1(h). As the HRTEM image and corresponding integrated pixel intensities are shown in Fig. 1(d and e), the average lattice spacings of core (red square, Fig. 1e1) and shell (green square, Fig. 1e2) regions in Pd@Ru NRs were measured to be 2.24 and 2.21 Å, which can be assigned to the Pd (111) and Ru (111) planes, respectively. In addition, we can also observe that both Pd@Ru and Pd@RuP NRs exhibit continuous lattice fringes from the inner Pd core to the outer Ru or RuP layers, indicating Ru or RuP shells extend the fcc structure and (111) plane of Pd via the epitaxial growth on the Pd NRs surface (Fig. 1i). This high lattice matching can be ascribed to the similar atomic radius of Pd and Ru and the templating effect exerted by the Pd NRs as the growth seeds [23,42,43]. By contrast, the well-resolved interplanar distances between Pd (111) core and Ru (111) shell in Pd@RuP NRs are expanded to be 2.22 Å (red square, Fig. 1j1) and 2.29 Å (green square, Fig. 1j2) in comparison with the relevant parts in Pd@Ru NRs. The enlarged lattice fringe spacings of Ru (111) shell in Pd@RuP NRs would be ascribed to the effective introduction of P. Meanwhile, the relative content of the elements in catalysts was determined by EDX spectra to be Pd81.60Ru18.40 of Pd@Ru NRs and Pd85.23Ru10.86P3.91 of Pd@RuP NRs (denoted as Pd@RuP3.91%) in terms of atomic ratios, indicating the effective introduction of Ru or RuP elements (Fig. S4). Ulteriorly, the P content in the Pd@RuP NRs can be tailored by modifying the metal precursor or incorporating an additional source of phosphorus source, such as triphenylphosphine. Through EDX analysis, we synthesized a series of Pd@RuP NRs with different P contents for subsequent comparisons of their HER performance, which are denoted as Pd@RuP2.93%, Pd@RuP8.31%, and Pd@RuP12.75%, respectively (Fig. S5). The crystalline structure of prepared catalysts was investigated by XRD in Fig. 2 (a). Pd NRs display four characteristic peaks at 40.12°, 46.91°, 68.03°, and 82.16°, which match well with the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of fcc-phase Pd (PDF # 46-1043) separately. Compared with Pd NRs, all the XRD diffraction peaks of Pd@Ru NRs shift to higher 2θ angles, which can be attributed to the compressive strain from the Ru shell on the Pd seed (Fig. S6) [44,45]. Correspondingly, the peaks of Pd@RuP exhibit consistency with those of Pd, showing no shifts. No characteristic peaks of Ru were detected in the XRD pattern indicating the ultrathin thickness of Ru shells with fcc structure [46]. The surface elemental information and electronic states of Pd@RuP and Pd@Ru NRs were further analyzed by XPS. For the high-resolution Pd 3d spectrum of Pd@RuP in Fig. 2(b), two narrow peaks centered at 335.19 eV (Pd 3d 5/2) and 340.45 eV (Pd 3d 3/2) can be attributed to metallic Pd0. Compared with those of Pd@Ru NRs, there shows a little negative shift of the binding energy of Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 in Pd@RuP NRs. Meanwhile, Ru 3d was considered the key research object since the Ru element on the surface was the main active site. As analyzed in Fig. 2(c), the Ru 3d 3/2 region can be deconvolved into C 1s part and Ru 3d 3/2 peaks. For the Ru 3d part, an obvious positive shift (∼0.51 eV) of Ru 3d 5/2 peaks to higher binding energy was observed in Pd@RuP NRs by comparison to Pd@Ru NRs (Fig. 1c). The higher binding energy change of the Ru 3d peak was ascribed to the effective doping of P elements in the Ru shell, thus causing more electron transfer and stronger electronic interaction in the RuP shell. 3.2 DFT calculations In addition, DFT calculations were performed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the electronic regulatory effect resulting from the introduction of P. The work functions of Pd@RuP, Pd@Ru, Pd(111), Ru(111), and RuP(111) were calculated to examine the charge transfer triggered by P insertion. We can observe that the existence of Pd NRs as the core can effectively enhance the work function of Pd@RuP (5.232 eV) than the RuP(111) surface of 4.934 eV (Fig. S7). Also, the higher working function of RuP(111) surface than the Pd(111) surface tends to cause the electron transfer from RuP to Pd at the heterojunction interface of Pd@RuP, facilitating the redistribution of electrons in the Pd@RuP catalyst. As further illustrated in Fig. 2(d and e), the introduction of P makes the work function of Pd@RuP increase to 5.232 eV, favors the enrichment of surface state electrons, and causes the stronger binding of H* on the Pd@RuP surface than Pd@Ru. Simultaneously, the partial density of states (PDOS) for Pd@RuP and Pd@Ru NRs have also been calculated in Fig. 2(f). We can clearly observe that both of the two catalysts exhibit strong intrinsic metallicity due to the continuity around the Fermi level in the density of states (DOS) curves [47]. Notably, only Ru and P elements coordinated in the extended part in Fig. 2(f) (marked by blue shadow), which indicates the effective coordination between Ru and P, causing the elongated energy level distribution of d electrons, thus accelerating electron delocalization and enhancing the conductivity of Pd@RuP. The P alloying can lead to the upshift of the Ru d-band center (Table S1), making it closer to the Fermi level, causing a higher antibonding level, and thus the stronger binding of H* on the Pd@RuP surface than Pd@Ru. The moderated d-band center in the Pd@RuP would bring in a suitable affinity for H* and optimized HER kinetics, as revealed in the HER volcano-shaped activity curve [40,48,49]. 3.3 HER performance To verify the composition and structural advantages of Pd@RuP NRs, we conducted the HER performance test in alkaline electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH. Pd@Ru NRs, RuP NPs, Pd NRs, and commercial Pt/C were investigated for the HER activity comparison. As expected, Pd@RuP NRs displayed the optimal HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of only 18 mV (η 10) at 10 mA cm−2 and 94 mV (η 50) at 50 mA cm−2 in Fig. 3 (a and b), which is better than Pd@Ru NRs (η 10 = 37 mV, η 50 = 130 mV), commercial Pt/C (η 10 = 36 mV, η 50 = 141 mV), RuP NPs (η 10 = 76 mV, η 50 = 236 mV), and especially Pd NRs (η 10 = 287 mV, η 50 = 424 mV). The inferior HER performance of RuP NPs compared to Pd@RuP NRs highlights the significant contribution of Pd NRs introduction. Accordingly, the role of Pd NRs in the Pd@RuPs NRs can be summarized as follows, (i) Pd NRs serve as templates, inducing the formation of the Ru fcc structure through epitaxial growth, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of Ru atoms; (ii) Pd NRs facilitate the formation of 1D ultrathin RuP alloy shell structure, enhancing the stability and utilization of Ru atoms; (iii) Pd NRs act as the inner core in the Pd@RuP core-shell structure to realize the electron movement between the Pd and RuP shells, accompanied by the d-band center adjustment of Ru atoms, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of Ru-based catalysts. It is noteworthy that the appropriate P content also plays a crucial role in enhancing the HER performance of Pd@RuP NRs. Notably, Pd@RuP3.91% NRs exhibited the optimal overpotential (18 mV @ 10 mA cm−2) and the highest mass activity of 2.018 A/mg (Fig. S8). Deviating from this P content, whether lower or higher, resulted in inferior HER performance. Moreover, the Tafel plots were also calculated to manifest the prominent HER reaction kinetics of Pd@RuP NRs. As shown in Fig. 3(c), Pd@Ru NRs exhibited the smallest Tafel slopes of 80.32 mV dec−1, suggesting a Volmer-Heyrovsky steps in the alkaline HER process, where the hydrogen desorption step (H* + H+ + e− → H2 + *) was the rate-determining step [50]. The HER performance of the prepared Pd@RuP NRs also surpass many previously reported noble metal-based catalysts from the point of η 10 and Tafel slopes, as listed in Tables S2 and S3, Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S9. The double layer capacitance (C dl) was calculated via CV curves acquired under different scan rates (Fig. S10) to reflect the ECSA of catalysts. As calculated in Fig. 3(e), the C dl of Pd@RuP NRs (9.29 mF cm−2) is much higher than that of Pd@Ru NRs (7.24 mF cm−2), RuP NPs (4.65 mF cm−2), Pd NRs (4.25 mF cm−2), and commercial Pt/C (3.16 mF cm−2) in 1.0 M KOH solutions, which explicitly indicates the greatly exposed reactive sites on the core-shell nanorod architecture. Concurrently, the ECSA-normalized HER polarization curves of Pd@RuP and other counterparts were calculated to compare the intrinsic activity of the catalysts (Fig. S11). It is evident that Pd@RuP NRs still demonstrate superior intrinsic HER activity compared to the other catalysts. The TOF was also commonly used to reveal the intrinsic HER activity of each reactive site. As demonstrated in Fig. 3(f), Pd@RuP NRs always presented the highest TOF values over the whole investigated potential ranges. Especially, Pd@RuP NRs could reach 0.131 s−1 at the 125 mV of overpotential, which is about 1.03 and 1.64 times larger than that of commercial Pt/C (0.127 s−1) and Pd@Ru NRs (0.080 s−1), respectively. These outstanding properties give rise to the enhanced HER activity. Furthermore, the EIS was tested to investigate the alkaline HER kinetics of catalysts on the electrode surface. As measured in Fig. 3(g), Pd@RuP NRs take on the smallest charge transfer resistance (R ct) among the catalysts, indicating the fastest charge transfer process between Pd@RuP NRs and the electrode and the best HER kinetics [51]. Apart from the electrocatalytic activity, the long-term stability is also an important assessment indicator of the HER performance in the actual application. After the ADT of 5000 scanning cycles, the η 10 of Pd@RuP NRs only increases by 3 mV in the HER polarization curves, which is smaller than that of commercial Pt/C (8 mV) and Pd@Ru NRs (9 mV), respectively. Meanwhile, the superior durability was further confirmed by the chronopotentiometry test. The overpotentials of Pd@RuP NRs at 10 mA cm−2 almost remained a constant over the continuous 20 h, in contrast with other two catalysts (Fig. 3i). Fig. S12 illustrates the preserved morphology and dispersity of the Pd@RuP NRs even after the stability test. Furthermore, XRD and XPS analyses (Fig. S12b–d) were performed to investigate the composition and crystalline structure change of the Pd@RuP NRs after the stability test, which showed minimal alterations. These findings serve as additional evidence supporting the exceptional electrocatalytic stability of the Pd@RuP NRs. Therefore, it is evident that the implementation of the core-shell structure and P insertion not only increases the number of exposed active sites and enhances the intrinsic activity of each site but also improves the electrocatalytic stability of the Pd@RuP NRs [13,28]. As known that Faradic efficiency is a vital parameter to quantify the effectiveness of the evaluated materials. We collect the generated H2 via a simple drainage method to calculate the Faradic efficiency of the HER (Fig. 4 a). The experimental H2 volumes show a good time-based relationship and agree well with the theoretical volumes, implying that the Faradic efficiency of Pd@RuP NRs is close to 100% throughout the HER process (Fig. 4b). To further evidence the intrinsic activity improvement according to the P insertion, we figure out the HER activation energy (E a) of catalysts based on the temperature-dependent polarization curves. As shown in Fig. 4(c and d), the overpotentials would decrease obviously when the temperature increases. Then, the E a value of Pd@RuP NRs was calculated to be 23.53 kJ mol−1 based on the Arrhenius plots obtained at 119 mV of overpotentials, undoubtedly lower than 28.62 kJ mol−1 of Pd@Ru NRs, further confirming that the P introduction could efficiently reduce the kinetic barrier during the HER process. Considering the extraordinary activity and robust durability towards HER of the core-shell Pd@RuP NRs, a self-made two-electrode HER//OER electrolyzer was assembled to explore the practicability of Pd@RuP NRs in water-splitting electrolysis, utilizing Pd@RuP NRs and commercial RuO2 as the cathode and anode electrodes separately in 1.0 M KOH solutions. Meanwhile, the electrolyzer assembled with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 (Pt/C//RuO2) was also evaluated as a benchmark. As the applied voltage rises, extensive bubbles are constantly accumulated on the surface of two electrodes (Fig. 4e, inset). Impressively, the Pd@RuP//RuO2-based electrolyzer exhibits significantly enlarged current density relative to commercial Pt/C//RuO2-based electrolyzer over the whole HER potential range (Fig. 4e). As presented in Fig. 4(f), the Pd@RuP//RuO2 couple achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with only 1.42 V, which is significantly lower than the 1.45 V required by the commercial Pt/C//RuO2 system. Furthermore, the Pd@RuP//RuO2 couple also exhibits remarkable activity even under high current density conditions (1.50 V at 50 mA cm−2 and 1.55 V at 100 mA cm−2), surpassing the commercial Pt/C//RuO2 couple. Fig. S13 demonstrates that the operational current density of the Pd@RuP//RuO2-based electrolyzer remains remarkably stable, even after an extended stability test at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. This implies that our prepared Pd@RuP NRs possess a huge potential in the practical application of water splitting for hydrogen evolution. 3.4 HER enhanced mechanisms In accordance with experimental results and corresponding discussions, the exceptional HER performance of the core-shell Pd@RuP NRs can be reasonably attributed to the following aspects: (i) the control synthesis of ultrathin Ru shell with fcc structure endow Pd@RuP NRs abundantly exposed active sites with high reactive activity; (ii) the high-efficiency construction of the interfaces would induce the electron transfer from the RuP ultrathin shell to the Pd core, thus promoting the electron redistribution in the Pd@RuP NRs; (iii) the introduction of P could also motivate the electron delocalization of Pd@RuP, cause the moderate Ru d-band center, and improve HER reaction kinetics. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successfully fabricated core-shell Pd@RuP NRs by facilely epitaxially growing a RuP alloy shell on the surface of Pd NRs which serve as the growth template. DFT results demonstrate that the construction of the interface engineering and the incorporation of P in Pd@RuP NRs could enhance the electrical conductivity and motivate electron transfer between the Pd core and RuP alloy shell, bringing in the moderate d-band center and a suitable affinity for H*, thus optimizing the HER reaction kinetics. Subsequently, the heightened alkaline HER catalysis of Pd@RuP NRs was verified by the experimental results with a very low overpotential (18 mV) and robust stability, which is even better than that of commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, Pd@RuP NRs also demonstrate significant potential in practical water splitting catalysis. We believe this study provides valuable insights into the enhancement of performance in noble metal-based catalysts through interface engineering and the doping strategy of light elements for electrocatalysis.

        "dc:description": "Ru with Pt-like hydrogen bond strength, knockdown cost (∼1/3 of Pt), and eximious stability is a competitive replacement for Pt-based catalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting. The design of Ru-based catalysts via interface construction, crystal phase control, and specific light element doping to realize the impressive promotion of limited activity and stability remains challenging. Herein, we report the fabrication of Pd@RuP core-shell nanorods (NRs) via an epitaxial growth method, where ultrathin RuP shells extend the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and (111) plane of the Pd NRs core. Density functional theory results confirm that the core-shell interface engineering and P doping synergistically accelerate electron transfer and moderate the d-band center to generate a suitable affinity for H*, thus optimizing HER kinetics. Compared with Pd@Ru NRs and Pt/C, the Pd@RuP NRs exhibit preferable electrocatalytic stability and superior activity with a low overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in the alkaline HER process. Furthermore, the integrated Pd@RuP//RuO2-based electrolyzer also displays a low operation potential of 1.42 V to acquire 10 mA cm−2, demonstrating great potential for practical water electrolysis. Our work presents an efficient avenue to design Ru-based electrocatalysts via epitaxial growth for extraordinary HER performance.",
