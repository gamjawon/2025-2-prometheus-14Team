Tin- or titanium-catalyzed dimethyl carbonate synthesis from carbon dioxide and methanol: Large promotion by a small amount of triflate salts Jun-Chul Choi Kazufumi Kohno Yoshihiro Ohshima Hiroyuki Yasuda Toshiyasu Sakakura ⁎ National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), AIST Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8565, Japan ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel./fax: +81 29 861 4719. The Bu2SnO- or Ti(O-i-Pr)4-catalyzed dimethyl carbonate (DMC) synthesis starting from methanol, carbon dioxide, and dimethyl ketal was remarkably accelerated by the addition of a small amount of [Ph2NH2]OTf (N:Sn=1:10); conventional acids such as H2SO4, HCl, and H3PO4 were not effective to promote the DMC synthesis. Keywords Carbon dioxide Dimethyl carbonate Homogeneous catalysis Acidic cocatalyst Green chemistry 1 Introduction Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is a key compound in so-called green chemistry. DMC itself is useful as electrolytes for lithium ion batteries and fuel additives [1]. DMC is also very important as environmentally benign synthetic reagents. It works as a substitute for toxic conventional methylating and carbonylating reagents such as methyl iodide, dimethyl sulfate, carbon monoxide, etc. [2,3]. Especially, it works as a substitute for phosgene; e.g. intermediates for polycarbonates or polyurethanes [4,5]. There are several processes proposed to synthesize DMC in an industrial scale [6]: (1) reaction of phosgene with methanol; (2) reaction of carbon monoxide with methanol in the presence of oxygen (oxidative carbonylation); (3) reaction of ethylene oxide with CO2 to produce ethylene carbonate, followed by ester exchange with methanol; (4) direct reaction of carbon dioxide and methanol (Eq. (1)) [7,8]. Although the last procedure is the most attractive in view of green chemistry, the reaction is thermodynamically quite unfavourable. Deactivation of the catalysts by co-produced water is another problem. In order to circumvent these problems, we have already reported tin- or titanium-catalyzed DMC synthesis starting from methanol and carbon dioxide in the presence of dimethyl ketals as a recyclable organic dehydrating reagent (Eq. (2)) [9–12]. In this paper, we report the remarkable acceleration of the DMC synthesis by the addition of a very small amount of acidic cocatalysts. (1) (2) 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All manipulations were conducted under purified argon or nitrogen. 2,2-dimethoxypropane, Bu2SnO, Ti(O-i-Pr)4, H3PO4 (100%), H2SO4 (95–98%), NaOTf, [Bu4N]Cl, p-toluenesulfonic acid, Sc(OTf)3 and HCl (1.25M methanol solution) were purchased from Aldrich Co. Carbon dioxide (Showa Tansan Co., Kawasaki, purity>99.99%) was used without further purification. The ammonium triflates of [Ph2NH2]OTf, [Ph2NH2]OTs, [Ph2NH2][1/2SO4], [Ph2NH2][CF3CO2], [Ph2NH2][CH3CO2], [Ph2NH2]Cl, [Ph2NH2]Br, [C6F5NH3]OTf, and [PyH]OTf were synthesized according to methods reported in the literature [13]. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a JEOL LA-400WB superconducting high-resolution spectrometer (400MHz for 1H). Reaction products were analyzed by GC using capillary columns; GL Science TC-1 (60m) on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene as the internal standard. All the volatile products were also characterized with GC–MS using a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph connected to a GCMS-QP 2010 Plus mass spectrometer. 2.2 Reaction procedure In a stainless steel autoclave (20cm3 inner volume), carbon dioxide (liquid, 65bar) was added to a mixture of methanol (100mmol), Bu2SnO (2mmol), [Ph2NH2]OTf (0.2mmol), and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (50mmol) at room temperature. The initial pressure was adjusted to 300bar at 180°C and the autoclave was heated at that temperature for 24h. After cooling, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (100μL) was added to the reaction mixture as the internal standard for the GC analysis. 2.3 Recycling of the tin catalyst for the DMC synthesis DMC synthesis was carried out as described above. All the volatiles were pumped out at room temperature under vacuum and were captured in a cold trap (liq. N2) for GC analysis. Slightly lower DMC yields shown in Fig. 3 compared with Table 1 were due to incomplete trap of DMC under vacuum. To the residue, which consists of the tin catalyst and [Ph2NH2]OTf, was added methanol (100mmol) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (50mmol). Carbon dioxide was injected and the mixture was heated at 180°C, 300bar for 24h. The next reaction was conducted in a similar manner. 2.4 Hydrolysis of 2,2-dimethoxypropane In a Schlenk flask (20cm3 inner volume), Bu2Sn(OMe)2 (2 or 0mmol), Sc(OTf)3 (0.02 or 0mmol) was added to a mixture of H2O (20mmol), 2,2-dimethoxypropane (50mmol), and methanol (100mmol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2h at room temperature. Then, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (100μL) was added to the reaction mixture as the internal standard for the GC analysis. The yields of acetone were 11, 100, and 100% based on water in the presence of the following catalysts: (Sn, Sc)=(0, 0), (2, 0.2), and (0, 0.2). 3 Results and discussion Since acidic compounds generally promote the esterification of carboxylic acids, effect of acidic cocatalysts on the tin-catalyzed DMC synthesis (esterification of carbonic acid) was investigated. The results are summarized in Table 1. The Bu2SnO-catalyzed reaction without adding acidic cocatalysts afforded DMC in 17% yield (entry 17). The addition of conventional BrΦnsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4 resulted in no remarkable increase of DMC yields (entries 12–14) while p-toluene sulfonic acid gave a slightly positive effect (entry 15). On the other hand, recently, metal or ammonium triflates have attracted much attention as acid catalysts for esterification [13,14]. In the present reaction, the addition of ammonium triflates such as [Ph2NH2]OTf and [C6F5NH3]OTf also resulted in the remarkable increase of DMC yields; more than double of the yield (40%) (entries 1 and 7) was achieved compared with the reaction without acidic cocatalysts (entry 17). Moreover, the selectivity of the reaction was quite high although aldol-type condensation of acetone was insignificantly observed under high conversion conditions. Efficiency of the cocatalysts is highly dependent on the kinds of anions. Thus, ammonium chlorides such as [Ph2NH2]Cl and Bu4NCl did not show any positive effects (entries 10 and 11). Among various diphenylammonium salts, triflate and tosylate exhibited positive effects (entries 1 and 2). Interestingly, NaOTf was as effective as [Ph2NH2]OTs (entries 2 and 9). Sc(OTf)3, a typical water-stable Lewis acid, hampered the reaction at least at the amount of 0.2mol% (vide infra) (entry 16). The effects of acidic cocatalysts largely depended on their amounts. Thus, optimum molar ratio for the Bu2SnO/[Ph2NH2]OTf system was 2.0/0.2mol% based on MeOH. However, optimum amounts for the Bu2SnO/Sc(OTf)3 system was 2.0/0.02mol% (Fig. 1 ). The addition of [Ph2NH2]OTf was also effective for the Ti(O-i-Pr)4-catalyzed DMC synthesis (Fig. 2 ). The DMC yield obtained by using Ti(O-i-Pr)4 plus [Ph2NH2]OTf was five times higher compared with the DMC yield achieved by Ti(O-i-Pr)4 alone. Time course of the Bu2SnO-[Ph2NH2]OTf system exhibited that the reaction stopped at a rather early stage of the reaction: DMC yields after 3, 9, 12, 24, and 48h were 17, 32, 36, 40, and 39%, respectively. The plateaued DMC yield after 12h indicated the thermodynamic limitation by equilibrium. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the double of the catalyst amount resulted in the same plateaued DMC yield as shown in Eq. (3). On the other hand, the temperature effect of the Bu2SnO-[Ph2NH2]OTf system showed that substantial formation of DMC required the temperature equal to or above 150°C: DMC yields at 50, 100, 150 and 180°C were 0%, 1%, 12%, and 40%. (3) Finally, recycling of the Bu2SnO/[Ph2NH2]OTf system was investigated. The catalyst could be easily recovered by distilling out the product (DMC) and the starting materials (methanol and 2,2-dimethoxypropane). Significant loss of the catalytic activity was not observed even after five times runs (Fig. 3 ). 4 Conclusion We have developed a new catalytic system for the direct CO2 conversion to dimethyl carbonate. The addition of a small amount of a triflate salt to Bu2SnO or Ti(O-i-Pr)4-based catalysts drastically enhanced the productivity. Since the hydrolysis of 2,2-dimethoxypropane is fast enough even in the absence of acidic cocatalysts (see Section 2.4), the present reaction acceleration is probably due to the acceleration of the DMC formation step (Eq. (1)). High catalytic activities obtained by using triflate salts are possibly related to affinity to scCO2 and relatively strong acidities. The recycling of the homogeneous catalyst was easily conducted without the loss of catalytic activity. References [1] M.A. Pacheco C.L. Marshall Energy Fuels 11 1997 2 [2] P. Tundo M. Selva S.
