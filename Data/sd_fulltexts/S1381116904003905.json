Fax: +55 212 562 8300. Cr3+ species modifies the reduction profiles of Cr6+ and CO desorption in Cr/SiO2 catalysts. This effect was not verified in function of distinct Cr A 2+/CrB 2+ ratios, obtained with different chromium precursors. Cr/SiO2 catalysts for ethylene polymerization, prepared with 1wt.% Cr and different chromium precursors, were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and desorption of carbon monoxide. Complete reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+ species was observed with CO at 623K, but the reduction profile modified in the presence of Cr3+, depending on the chromium precursor. The desorption of CO occurred in relatively low temperature for catalysts without Cr3+, independent of the Cr A 2+/CrB 2+ active sites ratio. The desorption of CO was observed at higher temperature in the catalysts containing Cr3+, suggesting modification of the Cr2+–CO adsorption strength in the presence of Cr3+. The desorption of CO2 was detected in all catalysts, associated to the CO disproportionation reaction at lower temperatures or to the decomposition of carbonates and carboxilates species above 500K. The desorption of CO agreed with polymerization activity results, showing the importance of this technique to characterize active chromium sites. Keywords Cr/SiO2 Chromium precursors TPR TPD CO DRIFTS Ethylene polymerization 1 Introduction Cr/SiO2 catalysts are used industrially in the ethylene polymerization [1]. The active chromium sites for polymerization are reported in the literature as Cr2+, named Cr A 2+, CrB 2+ and CrC 2+, depending on the chromium coordination with the support, 2, 3 and 4, respectively [2–5]. These species can be obtained by reduction with carbon monoxide from hexavalent chromium species at 623K [6,7]. However, trivalent chromium does not change in the same reduction conditions. The distribution of Cr3+/Cr6+ species in calcined Cr/SiO2 catalysts and, consequently, Cr3+/Cr2+ species in the CO reduced ones depends on the precursor salt, support, calcination and reduction conditions [8,9]. Concerning the Cr2+ sites, CrB 2+ and CrC 2+ species interact with one or two superficial hydroxyls of the support, respectively [4]. These species can be identified by carbon monoxide chemisorption followed by infrared spectroscopy [2–4,10]. The Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+ species are active in the polymerization and adsorb CO at 298K, while the CrC 2+species is inactive and does not adsorb CO at 298K [4]. This last species has been characterized by infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorbed at 77K. Thus, CO is a contaminant in the ethylene polymerization reaction, even in low concentration, once it adsorbs in the active sites [11], competing with ethylene. The desorption of CO in Cr/SiO2 catalysts has been studied by spectroscopic techniques [12–15]. The experiments have focused adsorption at different CO partial pressures, at 298K or at 77K. At 298K, Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+ adsorb CO, yielding bands in the IR spectrum at 2179 and 2188cm−1, respectively. On the other hand, few results of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) have been published. Parker et al. [14] studied desorption of carbon monoxide adsorbed in a Cr/SiO2 catalyst (0.95wt.% Cr), previously reduced with CO. The infrared spectrum presented bands at 2183 and 2097cm−1, ascribed to CO bonded to chromium species, linear (Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+) and in bridge, respectively. The attribution of these bands was also made by Zecchina et al. [15]. Particularly, both references showed that the band at 2097cm−1 represents CO weakly adsorbed in chromium site and it can be easily removed by vacuum. Zecchina et al. [15] ascribed the formation of isolated and paired chromium sites to the reduction of chromates and dichromates species, respectively. The isolated Cr and paired Cr–Cr sites give rise to linear and bridged-bonded CO adsorbed species, respectively. In fact, according to Parker et al. [14], the desorption of CO bonded in bridge is complete at 298K, while the desorption of the linear-bonded form occurs at higher temperature (up to 473K). This desorption behavior is different from the observed for CO on metals, for example, in metallic palladium [16]. In this case, the desorption of CO adsorbed linearly occurs at lower temperature, evidencing the largest stability of the CO–Pd adsorption in bridge. Bensalem et al. [12] and Zecchina et al. [13] observed carbonate and carboxilate species on Cr2O3/SiO2 and CrO3/SiO2 catalysts, respectively, after adsorption of CO and CO2. The desorption of these species was studied by Bensalem et al. [12] in CrO3/SiO2 catalysts after reduction with CO, yielding CO2. The authors suggest that at moderate temperatures (373–473K) carbonate species prevails, but at larger temperatures it is converted to carboxilate, since at 673K carbonate is not observed. Concerning the presented data, it is possible to suppose that carboxilate or monodentate carbonate species are still present on Cr/SiO2 catalysts, reduced with CO, after the usual treatment of cleaning the surface with inert gas flow or vacuum in the reduction temperature (623K). Recently, we reported that the distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species in calcined Cr/SiO2 catalysts depends on the chromium precursor. It also influences the distribution of Cr2+ active sites, obtained after reduction with CO, and the activity in the ethylene polymerization [8,17]. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the reduction and desorption behavior of carbon monoxide adsorbed in Cr/SiO2 catalysts, prepared with different precursors, using temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature programmed desorption experiments. TPD of CO adsorbed was accomplished in the attempt of distinguishing the Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+ sites by its adsorption strength for the comprehension of the catalyst structure. The goals were to determine whether different Cr2+ sites interact distinctively with CO and how this interaction is affected by the distribution of chromium species, which depends on the chromium precursor used in the preparation. There are not results in the open literature on the use of TPD analysis of CO adsorbed applied to Cr/SiO2 catalysts. However, the adsorption and desorption of CO followed by infrared analyses are frequently reported [2–4,18]. In this case, desorption is promoted by vacuum or inert gas flow at different temperatures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the catalysts The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of aqueous solutions (15cm3/g support) of chromium(II)acetate, chromium(II)chloride or chromium(VI)oxide over commercial SiO2 (299m2/g, 1.65cm3/g). Other chromium precursor, bis(triphenil)silylchromate (BTC), was prepared according to the methodology of Granchelli and Walker [19] and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis [20]. The catalysts were dried at 393K for 18h and calcined at 773K for 1h under dry air flow, resulting chromium contents close to 1wt.% Cr. Physical mixtures of CrO3 and α-Cr2O3 (Aldrich) with the calcined silica were also prepared in an agate mortar. All the samples were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy. 2.2 TPR and TPD of carbon monoxide The reduction and desorption of carbon monoxide analyses were accomplished in a Micromeritcs equipment (Model 2900) coupled with a mass spectrometer and a Balzers quadrupole. The samples were pre-treated with helium flow (AGA, 99.999wt.%) at 773K for 1h. The reduction was accomplished using a 5wt.% CO/He mixture flow (60ml/min) and the temperature was raised up to 623K (10K/min). After this step the samples were cleaned with helium flow (60ml/min) at 623K for 1h, followed by cooling to 298K. Then, CO adsorption was carried out by passing a flow of 5wt.% CO/He (60ml/min) for 30min. Finally, the desorption of CO was accomplished with helium flow (60ml/min) and the temperature was raised up to 773K (10K/min), keeping at this temperature for 1h. CO, CO2, H2O and H2 masses were monitored at (m/e) = 28, 44, 18 and 2, respectively. 2.3 DRIFTS Cr/SiO2 catalysts were also submitted to diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometry (DRIFTS) measurements on a NICOLET Magna IR 760 instrument equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory and a vacuum cell from Spectratech. This analysis was carried out in the calcined samples to observe the bands in the 2500–4000cm−1 region, ascribed to the interaction of chromium species with the surface hydroxyls of the support. The DRIFTS cell was filled with approximately 20mg of the sample, and the treatment with helium flow (AGA, 99.999wt.%) at 773K for 1h was carried out in situ. Spectra were recorded with a resolution of 4cm−1 with a DTGS detector and quantified as the subtraction of the background spectrum from the calcined sample spectrum. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TPR of CO Table 1 presents the chromium contents of the catalysts and physical mixtures, obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and the fraction of Cr3+ after calcination. In early studies [8,17], we reported that the distribution of chromium species on calcined catalysts depends on the precursor, but not on its nature, organic or inorganic. The Cr6+ and Cr3+ distribution will affect the Cr2+/Cr3+ ratio after reduction with carbon monoxide and, consequently, the activity of the catalyst in the ethylene polymerization. The amount of chromium in the hexavalent state was obtained by TPR, following the hypothesis of complete reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ with H2. The Cr6+ species was characterized by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and TPR as chromate or CrO3 species, independent of the precursor used [8]. Figs. 1–3 present the TPR results, in terms of CO and CO2 profiles, for the 1CrA and 1CrB catalysts and the MFCrO3 physical mixture, respectively. The 1CrC and 1CrD catalysts presented the same TPR profiles that the 1CrA. These samples presented a peak of CO consumption and a peak corresponding to the formation of CO2, both with maximum around 600K, ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+, except for the 1CrB catalyst. This catalyst presented peak of consumption of CO shifted to 100K in relation to the other samples. The difference in the reduction profile of 1CrB catalyst (Fig. 2) was evaluated in terms of Cr-support interaction. Table 1 presents the DRIFTS results based on intensity of the infrared band of isolated hydroxyls on calcined samples, at 3745cm−1, normalized by the band of 1CrA catalyst and by chromium content (I/I 1CrA). As higher the intensities ratio, lower the interaction of chromium with the isolated hydroxyls of the support. The catalysts presented the following order of interaction: 1CrA ≈ 1CrC > 1CrD > 1CrB. Thus, the lower reduction temperature of 1CrB catalyst can be attributed to weak interaction between chromium and silica, regarding the lower interaction with the hydroxyls of the support than the other catalysts. Besides, it is possible to suppose that the higher amount of Cr3+ in the 1CrB catalyst (76wt.%) influenced the reduction profile of Cr6+. The shoulder observed at 519K in Fig. 2 can also be ascribed to this low interaction. In previous studies [8], we have also observed distinct interactions in TPR profile of H2 for this catalyst. The 1CrC catalyst presented the same CO and CO2 profiles that the 1CrA and 1CrD catalysts, in spite of presenting 25wt.% of Cr3+ species (Table 1). This behavior can be due to the reducing strength of CO, making it difficult the observation of reducibility differences due to the lowest fraction of Cr3+ in this sample in comparison to the 1CrB. MFCrO3 physical mixture (Fig. 3) presented a peak of CO consumption at 602K, as well as the 1CrA, 1CrC and 1CrD catalysts, and another one, of lower intensity, at 536K. This peak was followed by a shoulder in the profile of CO2. Probably, the physical mixture preparation favored the presence of particles of CrO3 with bulk behavior and also heterogeneity, resulting in lower interaction with the support. These particles of CrO3 would present reduction at lower temperature. CO consumption was not verified in the TPR of the MFCr2O3 physical mixture, since Cr3+ is not reduced to Cr2+. However, little CO2 desorption was observed in the MFCr2O3 physical mixture as in the calcined silica, at 497 and 350K, respectively. It can be associated to the adsorption of CO2 from the atmosphere in the exposed samples. Although part of this CO2 has been removed during the initial treatment at 773K, a residual fraction was just eliminated during the TPR analysis. However, CO2 mass signal was not detected in the catalysts or in the MFCrO3 physical mixture in the 350–497K region, as verified in the support and in the MFCr2O3 physical mixture. The consumption of carbon monoxide (in mmolsCO/mgCr), relative to the mass m/e = 28, was obtained discounting the fraction corresponding to the fragmentation of CO2. The same reduction results were obtained using the data of CO2 production or CO consumption. The consumption of CO in TPR (experimental CO) was compared with the theoretical consumption of CO, considering the Cr6+ present in the calcined catalyst (Table 1). All the catalysts presented complete reduction from Cr6+ to Cr2+. The literature [6,7] reports that CO reduces Cr6+ to Cr2+ completely at 623K, with formation of CO2. 3.2 Thermal desorption of CO Fig. 4A and B present the temperature programmed desorption profiles of CO and CO2, respectively. CO desorption profiles showed a single peak in relatively low temperatures (<500K) for all catalysts, except to the MFCrO3 physical mixture, which presented two peaks. No desorption was observed at 298K. Parker et al. [14] suggested two CO desorption temperatures: at 298K, ascribed to bridged-bonded CO, and at higher temperature (up to 473K), associated to linear configuration, corresponding to CO adsorbed in Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+ sites. The absence of CO desorption at 298K agrees well with the assignment of chromate or CrO3 species in the calcined catalysts, reported in a previous paper [8], which after reduction are supposed to give isolated Cr sites and adsorption of linear-bonded CO [15]. The catalysts presented only one desorption peak at temperatures higher than 298K, suggesting the predominance of linear-bonded CO. Table 1 presents the Cr A 2+/(Cr A 2+ + CrB 2+) ratios, obtained by infrared analysis [17]. Considering the 1CrA and 1CrD catalysts, without Cr3+ species, the use of different chromium precursors resulted in 63 and 94% of Cr A 2+ sites, respectively. Despite this difference, the CO desorption temperature did not change, 379 and 360K, respectively, indicating similar CO–Cr A 2+ and CO–CrB 2+ bond strength. The desorption of CO also occurred at low temperature (350K) for MFCrO3 physical mixture (Fig. 4A), but other peak was observed at 435K. The first peak was also verified at similar temperature for 1CrA and 1CrD catalysts, which just presented Cr6+ species after calcination and complete reduction to Cr2+. The heterogeneity of the chromium particles in this physical mixture in comparison to the catalysts probably changed the adsorption strength of the probe molecule. The MFCr2O3 physical mixture did not present CO desorption, in agreement with the absence of CO chemisorption due to no reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+, according to TPR result of this sample. In the 1CrC catalyst, with 25wt.% Cr3+ (Table 1), the desorption of CO occurred at higher temperature, 495K. This fact can be attributed to the presence of Cr3+, modifying the Cr2+–CO adsorption strength. For the 1CrB catalyst, the small amount of Cr2+, obtained from the complete reduction of Cr6+ (only 24wt.%), resulted a low CO signal (Fig. 4A, magnification: 10-fold). Thus, the small amount of CO chemisorbed difficult the attribution of desorption peaks. H2 desorption was not observed in the experiments. The formation of H2 in TPD of CO has been observed in metallic catalysts, attributed to the reaction of CO with water, called gas-shift reaction (Eq. (1)) [16,21]. In this case, the evolution of H2 occurs simultaneously to the desorption of CO2 in metallic catalysts. The desorption of CO was followed by evolution of CO2 (Fig. 4), except for the 1CrC catalyst. The occurrence of both CO and CO2 desorption can be ascribed to the disproportionation of CO, according to Eq. (2). Note that simultaneous CO and CO2 desorption occur in greater extent for the 1CrD catalyst. The 1CrA catalyst presented desorption peak of CO2 at 384K, close to the observed for the desorption of CO (379K). The same behavior was verified in the analyses of the 1CrB, 1CrD and in the MFCrO3 physical mixture. However, the 1CrB and 1CrD catalysts also presented desorption of CO2 at higher temperatures, above 500K, which can be ascribed to carbonates or carboxilates decomposition. Bensalem et al. [12] observed that the desorption of these species could occur up to 673K. (1) H 2 O+CO⇄H 2+CO 2 (watergas-shiftreaction) (2) 2CO→CO 2+C (COdisproportionationreaction) In the analysis of the 1CrC catalyst (Fig. 4), the evolution of CO2 does not coincide with the CO desorption peak. However, low CO2 signal appears at higher temperature, close to the observed for the 1CrB and 1CrD catalysts, being attributed to the desorption of carbonate or carboxilate species. Table 2 reports the amounts of CO desorption, normalized by the result of the 1CrA catalyst. For comparative analysis, the results of CO chemisorption and the ethylene polymerization activity from our previous work [8] are also reported. In this reference, we showed that the distribution of bivalent and trivalent chromium species in reduced Cr/SiO2 catalysts depends on the chromium precursor. Samples of MFCr2O3 physical mixture and silica did not present CO chemisorption, as well as the MFCrO3 physical mixture without previous reduction, evidencing the selectivity of this technique for the characterization of Cr2+ species (Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+) [17]. The catalysts presented CO chemisorption in the following order: 1CrD > 1CrA ⪢ 1CrC > 1CrB, being 1CrD also the most active in the ethylene polymerization [8]. This order was also observed for the CO desorption and for the activity in the ethylene polymerization. The 1CrA and 1CrD catalysts, the highest active in ethylene polymerization, presented CO desorption at low temperature. This result is important by industrial point of view, because carbon monoxide is an important contaminant in the ethylene stream and inhibitor of the polymerization, competing with ethylene in the adsorption on the Cr A 2+ and CrB 2+ active sites. The desorption temperature observed for CO was similar to the polymerization temperature with Phillips type catalyst, around 353K. Besides, it seems to be a reliable technique to evaluate Cr2+ active sites for polymerization. 4 Conclusions The presence of Cr3+ species modifies the reduction profiles of hexavalent chromium in Cr/SiO2 catalysts, displacing the temperature to lower values. In the reduced catalysts without presence of Cr3+, CO desorption occurs at relatively low temperatures, indicating weak interaction between CO and the chromium active sites. In the catalysts containing Cr3+, desorption of CO occurs at higher temperature suggesting change of the Cr2+–CO adsorption strength by the presence of Cr3+. However, this interaction was not modified in function of distinct Cr A 2+/CrB 2+ ratios, obtained with different chromium precursors. Desorption peaks of CO2 above 500K were ascribed to carbonates or carboxilates decomposition. Desorption of CO at low temperature is important by industrial point of view, once CO is one of the main contaminant of the ethylene stream and inhibitor of the polymerization, competing with the ethylene for the Cr2+ active sites. The catalysts presented CO desorption and activity in the ethylene polymerization in the following order: 1CrD > 1CrA ⪢ 1CrC > 1CrB, showing the importance of this technique to evaluate Cr2+ active sites for polymerization.
