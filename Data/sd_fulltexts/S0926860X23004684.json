R. China ⁎ Corresponding author. With the demand for propene and the development of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation is an effective strategy to tackle the tight propene supply. Ga-based catalysts have immense potential for propane dehydrogenation among many environmentally friendly non-precious metal catalysts. Herein, we found that the hydrogen co-feeding not only significantly improved the activity but also enhanced the stability of Ga/Al-R catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The propane conversion rates at zero reaction time at a hydrogen concentration of 10% was 81 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1, almost twice as high as in the absence of hydrogen (43.8 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1). In addition, co-feeding with hydrogen significantly enhanced catalyst stability and resistance to carbon deposition. In-situ IR spectroscopy confirmed that the addition of hydrogen could effectively contribute to the production and enrichment of GaHx species. The H2-D2 exchange and elimination of GaHx species by CO2 experiments demonstrated that GaHx species was the more active site for PDH over Ga/Al-R catalyst.

In commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are used in the Oleflex process and CrOx/Al2O3 in the Catofin process. Both catalyst systems have many advantages but suffer from high cost, complex regeneration, and rapid deactivation or environmental unfriendliness [3]. This drives researchers to seek alternative catalysts. A series of catalysts which is environmentally friendly and inexpensive have been investigated, including GaOx [4], ZnOx [5,6], VOx [7], CoOx [8] as well as ZrOx [9], etc. Among the above metal oxides, GaOx-based catalysts are considered to be one of the most likely alternatives to Pt and Cr-based catalysts benefit from its higher TOFGa than others [10]. The bulk and supported Ga2O3 both have been studied in propane dehydrogenation. In the different polymorphs, the β-Ga2O3 contains more abundant weak Ga3+ Lewis acidity which exhibits higher catalytic activity than α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 [11]. Moreover, previous research indicated that the dehydrogenation activity of Ga species was highly dependent on the nature of support, the coordination state of gallium species, and catalyst acidity [12–15]. As reported by Xu et al. the Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2 and Al2O3 were more active than on TiO2 and almost inactive on SiO2 and MgO [16]. The authors suggested that the amount of medium to strong acid sites on the catalyst surface was responsible for the activity. However, the catalyst was rapidly deactivated due to high-density strong acid sites resulting in coking [17]. The mononuclear Ga sites in Al2O3 support and dinuclear in SiO2 were prepared by Szeto et al. [18] with the assistance of organometallic chemistry and found that the former catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the latter in propane dehydrogenation. They suggested that the presence of Ga-O-Al promoted the activation of propane C-H. Although these studies indicated that Ga catalysts exhibited excellent propane dehydrogenation performance when alumina was used as a support, alumina varied and its properties (acidity, defects, texture) depended on the synthesis process, which could have a significant impact on its catalytic performance when loaded with active components [19]. Therefore, the appropriate alumina support for Ga species needs to be further explored to achieve high propane dehydrogenation activity and stability. Diverse Ga-based zeolite catalysts have been studied in alkanes dehydrogenation in recent years, the different preparation methods and subsequent reduction or oxidation treatments create Ga with different coordination environments. Besides, the Ga species and their PDH performance were largely influenced by both Ga/Al ratio and the Al distribution in the zeolites [20–24]. Thus, various Ga species were identified, such as Ga+-H+ pair sites, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, Ga2O2 2+, Ga+, etc [21,22,25]. However, the true active site was fraught with conflicting claims. Rane et al. [26] argued that GaO+ cations were the most active among the Ga+, GaH2 +, and GaO+ cations, and that propane was not converted over GaH2 +. Xu et al. [21]. suggested that propane was reactivated more efficiently on Ga+-H+ than on isolated Ga+ sites, which were identified by the TOFGa at different Ga/Al and Si/Al ratio. In their later work, they considered that the PDH activity of the divalent Ga species (Ga2O2 2+) was at least 18 times higher than the isolated Ga+ in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [22]. The Ga2O2 2+ was the dominant species in the sample with absolute Ga loading and could not be reduced to form hydrides or undergo oxidation by O2. The [GaH]2+ cations were identified as the most active site for propane dehydrogenation, which was proposed by Bell et al. through quantum chemical calculations, mechanisms, and kinetic studies [25,27]. Yuan et al. discovered that Ga2O3 diffuses into the zeolite after reduction, forming extra-framework Ga+ sites. These sites served as the active centers for catalyzing propane dehydrogenation [21]. It is worth noting that the isolated Ga+ site could react with H2 reversibly to form GaHx species. However, Liu et al. [28]. found that GaHx intermediate species was unfavorable and reduced the reaction rate, selectivity, and propene yield for Ga2O3/SiO2. The generation of Ga3+-O via CO2 elimination of GaHx promoted catalytic performance. Therefore, the structure of Ga species and the actual active site of Ga-based catalyst were influenced greatly by the kind of support and reaction atmosphere. Although alumina has been proposed as a promising support for Ga-based catalysts, the activity still needs to be further improved by adjusting the properties of the support, and the catalytic active site needs to be elucidated. In this work, we revealed the catalytic performance of Ga species on alumina with different properties. It was further discovered that the addition of hydrogen in the reaction promoted propane conversion for Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The facilitating effect of hydrogen was verified through various experiments. The intermediate species under reaction conditions were monitored by in situ infrared spectroscopy and it was determined that the addition of hydrogen promoted the production of more active GaHx intermediate species. H2-D2 exchange experiments and CO2 elimination of GaHx species were used to further demonstrate that GaHx species promote dehydrogenation performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Raw materials and pretreatments Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9 H2O, 99% purity, sourced from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co.) and Urea (CO(NH2)2, 99% purity, sourced from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co.) Gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 99% purity, sourced from Aladdin). Commercial Al2O3 (Al-C, 99% purity, sourced from Aladdin), SiO2 (99% purity, sourced from Aladdin), Boron nitride (BN, 99.9% purity, sourced from Aladdin), and Hydroxyapatite (HAP, 99.9% purity, sourced from Aladdin) were used without further purification. 2.2 Catalysts synthesis The rodlike (Al-R) and sheet (Al-S)-shaped Al2O3 were synthesized according to our previous work [29]. To synthesize the rodlike alumina, 85.5 mmol of urea (CO(NH2)2) and 17.1 mmol of aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9 H2O) were dissolved in deionized water. The solution was then packed into a 120 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 36 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained solid product was filtered and washed with deionized water to neutralize, and dried overnight in the air at 50 °C. Finally, the Al2O3 was obtained by calcining at 600 °C for 2 h in the air. The synthesis of sheet-shaped alumina followed the same process as described above, but with n(Al3+): n(CO(NH2)2) ratio of 1:9 and a reaction time of 48 h. The catalysts were prepared by using an incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate with a specific concentration was impregnated on the support using the incipient wetness technique. The impregnated sample was then left at room temperature for 2 h and subsequently dried overnight at 50 °C. After that, the sample was calcined in air at 600 °C for 2 h. The catalysts obtained with different supports were named Ga/S (where S represents the support). All prepared catalysts contained 5 wt% of gallium, according to the theoretical calculation. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a PANalytical X′Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm), the scan rate and step size were 0.169°/s and 0.026°, respectively. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus with a TCD detector. Typically, the sample was pretreated at 600 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the temperature was reduced to 100 °C, and ammonia was pulsed until no further adsorption was observed. The samples were then exposed to a helium flow atmosphere for 1 h to remove any gas phase and physically adsorbed NH3. After that, the sample was heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a helium flow (50 mL/min). The desorbed ammonia gas was detected by mass spectrometry. The type of acid site in the sample was determined by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra using a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum TM GX spectrometer. The sample was compressed into a wafer (15 mg (cm2)−1) and then activated in vacuum in the in situ FTIR cell at 350 °C for 6 h. After achieving the background, the activated wafer was exposed to pyridine vapor at 150 °C for 30 min and then evacuated for 2 h to collect the FTIR spectra. The in situ FTIR spectrum under the reaction atmosphere was obtained using a Bruker 70 V spectrometer, and the background spectrum was collected under an argon atmosphere after dehydrating the sample in the spectral cell at 520 °C. Specifically, the catalyst was pretreated in an argon atmosphere at 520 °C for 30 min in an in-situ reaction cell to remove adsorbed water and gas impurities, and the background spectrum was collected in these conditions. Then, the reaction atmosphere or a mixture of H2/Ar was introduced into the cell, and infrared spectra were recorded over time. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded by a Hitachi S-4800 instrument, and the sample preparation by applying a powder sample to a conductive adhesive. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were conducted on a JEOL JEM-F200 (200 kV). The sample preparation by dispersing powdered samples in ethanol and adding them dropwise on a microsieve, which was loaded into the TEM chamber. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer. The specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer STA 449 F3 (NETZSCH) was used to determine the amount of coke deposited. 2.4 Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic performance was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor equipped with quartz tubes (8 mm) at atmospheric pressure. Initially, 100 mg of catalyst was treated under an N2 atmosphere at 600 °C in a reaction tube for 30 min to eliminate any adsorbed impurities. After the pretreatment, the reaction was conducted at 600 °C by passing the reaction gas through the reactor. A blank experiment was performed without loading the catalyst, while maintaining all other conditions consistent with the catalyst test. The concentration of C3H8 was maintained at 10%, and the total flow rate was kept constant at 15 mL/min for all tests. Nitrogen was used as the equilibrium gas. Consecutive dehydrogenation regeneration cycles were performed by passing 20% O2/N2 over the catalyst at 600 °C for 2 h after each dehydrogenation reaction cycle to remove carbon deposits. The products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph supplied with alumina packed and molecular sieve 5 A columns. The propane conversion and product selectivity data were calculated by the equations Propane conversion = [ F in (C 3 H 8 ) F in (N 2 ) − F out (C 3 H 8 ) F out (N 2 ) ] / [ F in (C 3 H 8 ) F in (N 2 ) ] Propene selectivity = ( n i / 3 ) × F out ( i ) ∑ i [ ( n i / 3 ) × F out ( i ) ] × 100 where i denotes the hydrocarbon product in the outflow gas stream, F(i) and n i are the flow rate and the number of carbon atoms of component i, respectively. The catalyst stability was evaluated by first-order deactivation model: Kd={In[(1-Xfinal)/Xfinal]-In[(1-Xinitial)/Xinitial]}/t where Xinitial and Xfinal represent the conversion recorded at the start and the end of an experiment, respectively, and t represents the reaction time (h), kd is the deactivation rate constant (h−1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The catalyst structure and chemical properties In order to understand the physical structure and chemical properties of the support and the corresponding catalyst, a series of characterizations was performed. The microscopic morphology of the synthesized alumina was characterized by SEM and TEM, and the results were shown in Fig. S1. The synthesized alumina Al-R and Al-S samples were in the form of rough rods and thin nanosheets, respectively. The XRD patterns of different alumina and corresponding catalysts were shown in Figs. S2a and b. The diffraction peaks at 37.1°, 45.7° and 66.7° in Al-R and Al-S samples were attributed to the γ-Al2O3, while the Al-C alumina was a mixed phase of γ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3, and α-Al2O3 [30]. No diffraction peaks assigned for Ga2O3 in Fig. S3 were observed in these three catalysts indicated that Ga2O3 was present as small particles on the aluminum supports [28]. However, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 in Al-R and Al-S samples was significantly enhanced after the loading of gallium, which was attributed to the increase of alumina crystallinity promoted by Ga ions [31]. There were no large Ga2O3 particles present in these samples were also confirmed by the elemental maps displayed in Figs. S4 a and b. The average gallium content measured by EDS for Ga/Al-R, Ga/Al-S and Ga/Al-C catalysts was 3.2%, 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively (Fig. S5-S7, Table S1). The N2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions of all samples were displayed in Fig. S8. All Al2O3 materials exhibited a concentrated distribution of mesoporous structures and their specific surface areas ranged from 80 to 270 m2/g for different supports, and it only slightly affected the support structure after loading Ga. The detailed structural parameters were listed in Table S2. NH3-TPD experiments were an effective tool for analyzing the number and strength of acid sites on the catalyst surface. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), all Al2O3 supports exhibited broad desorption peaks, but the temperature ranges and intensities of the peaks were remarkably different, indicating variations in acid site intensities and quantities. It is commonly considered that the desorption peak at 150–250 °C was attributed to ammonia binding to weak acid sites, with a peak at 250–400 °C assigned to medium-strong acid sites, while above 400 °C was ascribed to strong acid sites [32]. To further understand the distribution of acid sites on different supports, the desorption profiles were fitted by the Gaussian function. The ammonia desorption peak centers of the samples with different temperature intervals were listed in Table 1, and the total acidities calculated from ammonia pulse adsorption were also listed. It could be observed from Table 1 that the acid sites were similarly distributed for all samples, with medium-strong acid sites predominating and the presence of some weak acids and absence of strong acid sites, while the peak centers around 300–360 °C increased successively from Al-C, Al-S, Al-R samples, suggesting an increase in acid site intensity. The total acidities for Al-R, Al-S, and Al-C samples were 217, 125, and 60 μmol NH3 g−1, respectively. After loading metal oxide Ga2O3, the total acidities were further increased for all catalysts, while the distribution of acid sites remained unchanged. To gain insights into the acid properties of the synthetic support and the corresponding catalyst, an in-situ FTIR test coupled with pyridine adsorption was conducted. The results were presented in Fig. 1 (c, d). All support exhibited three characteristic IR absorption peaks at 1614, 1490, and 1450 cm−1, which could be attributed to the interaction of pyridine species with Lewis acid sites related to the coordination of unsaturated Al3+ in Al2O3 [33–35]. The absence of a characteristic peak at 1640 or 1540 cm−1 for pyridine adsorption with Brønsted acid [23,36] demonstrated that there were insufficient Brønsted acid sites in the support for the adsorption of pyridine molecules. It was worth noting that after gallium loading, there was no alteration in the acid type of the support. However, there was a significant increase in peak intensity, indicating an increase in total acidities. The acid sites were derived from the unsaturated coordination of Ga3+ [11,37]. This was consistent with the NH3-TPD results. 3.2 Catalytic performance for PDH To gain a thorough understanding of the role of support effects on catalytic activity, various low-acid supports such as SiO2, HAP, as well as BN, were utilized in addition to Al2O3 for comparative study. The catalysts and supports were evaluated for propane dehydrogenation activity, and the results were shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S11. The Ga2O3 supported on Al2O3 exhibited relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to the other supports. In the cases of Ga2O3 on different Al2O3 supports, they demonstrated similar and stable propene selectivity (∼ 90%), but had distinct propane conversion. The Ga/Al-R sample showed the highest initial propane conversion of 38.5%, which decreased to 26.1% after 240 min of the reaction, while the Ga/Al-S and Ga/Al-C showed comparatively low propane conversion of 21.4% and 17.8%, respectively, but they exhibited better stability (Fig. 2 a). The pristine Al2O3 was utilized for PDH to exclude its activity. All three alumina supports demonstrated low propane conversion but had different propene selectivity. The Al-R showed nearly 80% propene selectivity, while Al-C showed only 57% propene selectivity, almost identical to the blank experiment, which could be attributed to their different acidity levels. The catalytic capability of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ in the dissociation of H-H and C-H bonds had been confirmed through theoretical calculations and experimental evidence [30,35,38]. The low activity of Al2O3 suggested that Ga species acted as the active site for propane dehydrogenation. In the cases of Ga2O3 on the other supports, the Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion (9.2%) and propene selectivity (86%) due to its high surface area (292 m2/g) compared to HAP (81 m2/g) and BN (80 m2/g), which facilitated the dispersion of Ga2O3 on the support (Fig. S11). However, the activity of the catalyst using SiO2 support (292 m2/g) was still much lower than on Al2O3-C with a low surface area (89 m2/g). These results implied that alumina was an appropriate support to achieve superior propane dehydrogenation performance for Ga-based catalysts. The synergy between neighboring Al and Ga sites enhancing the activity in ethane dehydrogenation compared to the sites on pristine Al2O3 had been reported by Sai et al. [37]. Taking into consideration these results and the support properties, it could be envisioned that alumina with a high specific surface area and a plentiful supply of acid sites as the support for Ga species could generate a greater number of active sites that were advantageous for propane dehydrogenation. The capability of catalyst regeneration capability is another crucial indicator for evaluating catalysts. Therefore, five dehydrogenation-oxidation regeneration cycles were performed on the fresh catalyst to assess its stability and regeneration capacity (Fig. 2 c). Remarkably, the catalysts demonstrated excellent regeneration capabilities, with only a slight decrease in propane conversion observed in the first recycle compared to the fresh catalyst, which could be fully recovered in the subsequent three recycles. Throughout all cycles, propane conversion remained above 30%, while propene selectivity consistently maintained a level above 90%. Consequently, the Ga/Al-R catalyst exhibits superior regeneration ability, suggesting its potential for noteworthy industrial applications. 3.3 The facilitative effect of hydrogen To illustrate the facilitation of hydrogen co-feeding on the propane dehydrogenation, we evaluated the Ga/Al-R catalyst with different feeds. Taking into consideration the difference in equilibrium conversion at various concentrations of hydrogen, we measured the dehydrogenation performance of the catalysts at propane conversion levels below 15%. Furthermore, we extrapolated the initial propane conversion rates to zero reaction time. As depicted in Fig. 3 a, propane conversion increased as the hydrogen concentration increased, until it reached a maximum value. Subsequently, the propane conversion ceased to increase despite further increases in hydrogen concentration. The propane conversion rates at zero reaction time, with a hydrogen concentration of 10% was calculated to be 81 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1, which was almost twice as high as the rates in the absence of hydrogen (43.8 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1). Additionally, the propene selectivity remained above 90% in the presence of hydrogen, whereas in its absence, propene decreased from 90% to 80% after 240 min of reaction time. The dynamic experiment shown in Fig. 3 c demonstrated that propane conversion increased after the introduction of hydrogen and remained stable over time. Conversely, propane conversion and propene selectivity decreased after the removal of hydrogen and gradually declined as time progressed. These findings substantiate the crucial role of hydrogen in enhancing catalytic performance and stabilizing propene selectivity. The gradual decrease in propene selectivity observed without the presence of hydrogen can be attributed to changes in the active sites of the catalyst. This suggests that the introduction of hydrogen can consistently provide an active species with a more stable propane dehydrogenation capability and higher propene selectivity. The role of hydrogen was further evaluated through long-time stability tests. The results presented in Fig. 3 d indicate that the initial propane conversion was 38.5%, which slowly decreased to 21.6% over a reaction time of 600 min in the presence of H2. The catalyst exhibited a deactivation rate of 0.08 h−1 during this period while maintaining a propene selectivity above 90%. On the other hand, the catalyst without H2 co-feeding had an initial propane conversion of only 32.8%, lower than that of the hydrogen co-feeding case. In this case, the catalyst rapidly deactivated with a rate of 0.18 h−1, resulting in an activity of only 7.2% after 600 min. Moreover, the propene selectivity was reduced to as low as 77% after 600 min test. These results strongly suggested that the addition of hydrogen improved catalyst stability. It is commonly known that coke deposits caused by acid sites at high temperatures are the primary reasons for catalyst deactivation [24]. We evaluated the coke deposits on Ga-Al/R catalysts after the reaction under both reaction conditions, as displayed in Fig. S12. The coke deposits in the presence of co-feeding hydrogen, after a reaction time of 600 min were only 8.2 wt%, significantly lower than the 15.2 wt% in the absence of hydrogen. This indicated the remarkable effect of co-feeding hydrogen with propane on inhibiting carbon deposits. While co-feeding hydrogen to inhibit carbon deposition had been reported on Pt-based catalysts, it was important to note that increasing hydrogen coverage could increase the dehydrogenation energy barrier, thereby reducing the conversion rates of propane to propene [39,40]. However, in our experiments, hydrogen co-feeding improved the propane conversion rates on Ga/Al-R catalyst. Additionally, the Ga/SiO2 catalyst, which has been shown to have GaHx species formed during PDH [28], resulting in the degradation of propane conversion and propene selectivity was tested in hydrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S13, the propane conversion did not improve with the addition of hydrogen, and the propene selectivity decreased as time progressed. This phenomenon was different from that observed with Ga/Al-R, suggesting the presence of different active sites on Ga/Al-R and Ga/SiO2. Several scholars had experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that GaHx species exhibited higher activity in propane dehydrogenation over Gallium-based zeolite catalysts [21,25]. Therefore, based on the experimental results, we believed that the presence of hydrogen may have facilitated the production of GaHx species, thereby improving the catalytic performance of the Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy was used to identify intermediate species produced under different reaction atmospheres. The generation of Ga surface species under a real reaction atmosphere is crucial for elucidating the effect of reaction atmosphere on catalytic performance [27], in situ IR spectra were performed under various reaction atmospheres, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 (a,b). When reaction atmosphere of 10/10/80 vol% C3H8/H2/Ar was introduced into the in-situ reaction cell, a new band at 1940–2009 cm−1 was observed after 10 min. This band was assigned to the stretching vibration of H bonded with coordinately unsaturated gallium cation [41,42], and the peak intensity increased with time before stabilizing. However, no GaHx band between 1940 and 2009 cm−1 was observed during PDH without H2 co-feeding. These results indicate that the addition of hydrogen promotes the formation of GaHx species during the reaction. It has been reported that hydrogen can dissociate and adsorb on gallium catalysts to form GaHx species [42], in situ IR spectroscopy was performed to examine the changes in Ga species under a 20% H2/Ar atmosphere. Fig. 4 (c) showed that the intermediate GaHx species appeared once hydrogen was introduced, accompanied by a broad band at 3556 cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibration of the O-H groups coordinated to Ga3+ centers [20,43]. The intensity of the Ga-OH peak decreased until it disappeared, while the intensity of the GaHx peak gradually increased. This indicated that Ga-OH converts to GaHx in hydrogen atmosphere at high temperature. Notably, the GaHx signal disappeared rapidly when the sample was exposed to an Ar atmosphere and recovered rapidly when hydrogen was reintroduced (Fig. S14), suggesting that the GaHx species is dependent on hydrogen for its existence. To get insight into the interaction between C3H8 and GaHx at reaction temperature, the in situ infrared spectroscopy was performed by C3H8 was introduced after stable GaHx species had formed under a 20% H2/Ar atmosphere. Fig. 4 d showed that the intensity of GaHx species decreased rapidly after the introduction of C3H8, then gradually increased to a maximum. This indicated that the GaHx species could be consumed by C3H8, and fortunately, due to the presence of hydrogen the consumed GaHx was rapidly replenished and reached a new dynamic equilibrium as the reaction proceeds. Furthermore, the effect of hydrogen concentration on GaHx species was investigated by in situ infrared spectra and the results were shown in Fig. 4 e and Fig. S15. The signal intensity of GaHx species increased with increasing hydrogen concentration in a certain hydrogen concentrations range, which was attributed to the production of more GaHx species due to the increase in hydrogen coverage on the catalyst surface. With continued increased hydrogen concentration, the small change in signal intensity for GaHx species was due to the fact that there was already sufficient hydrogen coverage to enable the conversion of Ga species to GaHx species. The consistency of propane conversion and GaHx intensity with the variation of hydrogen concentrations further suggested that the formation of GaHx species played a crucial role in propane conversion. 3.4 The crucial role of GaHx species on PDH To further elucidate the crucial role of GaHx species in propane activation, the performance of C3H8-D2 co-feeding was evaluated, and the DRIFT spectra were collected. Fig. 5 a revealed that propane conversion was only around 10% under C3H8-D2, significantly lower than the approximately 25% conversion under C3H8-H2, and the propene selectivity also decreased. The DRIFT spectra of D2 treatment in Fig. 5 c demonstrated the appearance of new broad bands at 1444 cm−1, which were assigned to the GaDx species [44]. The formation of GaDx species in C3H8-D2 reactant correlated with the decreased PDH activity, providing further evidence for the unique role of GaHx in propane activation. The GaHx species completely decomposed in an Ar atmosphere within 5 min, whereas the GaD2 species remained even after 30 min of Ar purging due to the kinetic isotope effect [45], suggesting that the dissociation of GaDx may limit the propane conversion. Based on the experimental and characterization analysis mentioned above, it was observed that despite the rapid deactivation of the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, both propene and hydrogen products were still generated and small amounts of hydrogen may have formed GaHx species, although they could not be detected by infrared spectra. Consequently, the elimination of GaHx species became crucial for comprehending the true active site. In this regard, Liu et al. [28] reported that CO2 over Ga/SiO2 catalyst could effectively eliminate the Ga-hydrides. To gain further insights into the actual contribution of GaHx intermediate species to propane conversion over Ga/Al-R catalysts, GaHx species produced under reaction conditions were eliminated through CO2 co-feeding. The PDH activity in the presence of CO2 atmosphere was evaluated, and DRIFT spectra were also collected, and the corresponding results were illustrated in Fig. 6. The initial propane conversion and propene selectivity dropped significantly to only 13.4% and 85% respectively, which was much lower compared to the system without CO2 co-feeding that exhibited 32.8% propane conversion and 91% propene selectivity. The simultaneous increase in propane conversion and selectivity upon switching off CO2 in the reaction suggested a mutation in the active site between the two reaction atmospheres. The in situ IR spectra shown in Fig. 6 b proved the elimination of GaHx species by CO2, as GaHx species were not detected when CO2 and H2 were simultaneously passed into the IR reaction cell for 30 min. However, GaHx species appeared after 5 min of CO2 switch-off, and the peak intensity increased as CO2 concentration decreased (Fig. 6 c). Generally, the utilization of CO2 in PDH could alleviate the chemical equilibrium in the reaction by eliminating H2 through inverse water gas conversion. Moreover, it enhanced the olefin yield and catalytic stability by inhibiting coke deposition through Boudouard reactions [46–49]. Nevertheless, the addition of CO2 inhibited the PDH activity of the Ga/Al-R catalyst because it altered the structure of the Ga species in the reaction atmosphere. The results demonstrated that the GaHx intermediate species produced in the reaction exhibited higher activity for PDH on Ga/Al-R catalysts. 4 Conclusion In summary, the Ga species supported on alumina with abundant acid sites exhibited superior catalytic performance. Co-feeding with hydrogen significantly facilitated the conversion of propane, with the propane conversion rates at zero reaction time at a hydrogen concentration of 10% being almost twice as high as in the absence of hydrogen. Furthermore, co-feeding with hydrogen effectively enhanced stability and resistance to carbon deposition without decreasing propane conversion. Consequently, a propane conversion of 38.5% was achieved, with a deactivation rate of 0.08 h−1 and propene selectivity maintained above 90%. The H2-D2 exchange and elimination of GaHx species by CO2 experiments demonstrated that intermediate GaHx species produced during the reaction served as highly active sites for propane dehydrogenation over the Ga/Al catalyst. The presence of higher hydrogen concentration facilitated the production and constant replenishment of active GaHx species exhausted by propane, thereby stabilizing the catalytic activity. Additionally, the catalyst could be regenerated repeatedly regeneration through the combustion of carbon. Overall, the outcome of this study may contribute to the development and application of Ga-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

        "dc:description": "With the demand for propene and the development of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation is an effective strategy to tackle the tight propene supply. Ga-based catalysts have immense potential for propane dehydrogenation among many environmentally friendly non-precious metal catalysts. Herein, we found that the hydrogen co-feeding not only significantly improved the activity but also enhanced the stability of Ga/Al-R catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The propane conversion rates at zero reaction time at a hydrogen concentration of 10% was 81 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1, almost twice as high as in the absence of hydrogen (43.8 mmolC3H8gcat −1h−1). In addition, co-feeding with hydrogen significantly enhanced catalyst stability and resistance to carbon deposition. In-situ IR spectroscopy confirmed that the addition of hydrogen could effectively contribute to the production and enrichment of GaHx species. The H2-D2 exchange and elimination of GaHx species by CO2 experiments demonstrated that GaHx species was the more active site for PDH over Ga/Al-R catalyst.",
