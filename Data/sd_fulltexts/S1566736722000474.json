Inspired by the 3D hierarchical porous structure and abundant hydroxyl groups of wood, we used basswood as a biological template to synthesize NiFe/porous carbon (C) through an impregnation and pyrolysis strategy. The optimized NiFe/C composite exhibited an impressive low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. More importantly, the catalyst had an extremely good durability. This study provides an alternative strategy to utilize green wood-based materials to design highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. Keywords Oxygen evolution reaction NiFe alloy Porous structure Wood-derived carbon 1 Introduction Environmental pollution and energy shortage issues have caused a demand for sustainable energy. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anode plate reaction of green energy systems, such as water electrolysis, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries, is subjected to a slow kinetic process [1–6]. Catalysts composed of transition metals and carbon materials are among the most promising materials expected to replace precious metals (e.g., RuO2) [7,8]. The widely distributed natural and pollution-free biomass was used as a cheap renewable carbon precursor for its conversion into a unique carbon material with high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity, which might be an effective means to alleviate energy ecological problems [9–11]. Wood is a kind of biodegradable green carbon material, which has been paid much attention to because of its low cost and regular arrangement of vertical channels [12]. However, the electrical conductivity of wood is poor, which is not conducive to the transfer of electrons during the OER reaction, and the carbon structure is easy to collapse at high temperatures, resulting in a reduction of active sites [13,14]. 3D transition metal elements (such as Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) have abundant unpaired d-orbitals electron density due to their high conductivity, which shows their unique electrochemical properties [15–18]. However, the catalytic activity and stability of transition metal elements are still limited due to their aggregation and poor stability during electrocatalysis [19,20]. Many studies have shown that the three-dimensional porous structure of organic materials (such as wood), and transition metal composites can provide a good path for electron transport, which makes it an extremely attractive raw material for the synthesis of non-precious metal electrocatalysts [21–23]. Lars et al. [24] synthesized the NiFe RTNCs hierarchically porous carbonized wood (CW) through a pyrolytic procedure, which was the first reported carbonized wood-based catalyst tested for OER. Hu et al. [25] used the heat shock treatment method to achieve the rapid self-assembly of chainmail catalyst nano-particles (N-C-NiFe) in the open and low-tortuosity CW-CNT framework, which showed remarkable electrochemical performance and good stability for HER. However, there is still a lack of a simple and scalable synthesis method of catalytic materials to realize a large-scale use of wood-based carbon materials. Here, the optimized NiFe/porous carbon (C) composite was synthesized through a universal impregnation combined with a high-temperature pyrolysis method, which exhibited an impressive low overpotential of 259 mV for OER in 1.0 M KOH that reaches a current density of 10 mA cm−2. More importantly, the presented catalyst has extremely good durability. The charge transfer effect inside the alloy and the strong coupling between the alloy and graphitized carbon together improve the OER activity and reaction kinetics. Our study provides an alternative strategy to utilize green wood-based materials to design highly efficient OER catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials synthesis Taking the preparation of NiFe/C as an example, the other transition metal/alloy powder samples were prepared similarly. First, the wood pre-treatment was carried out. The natural wood was cut into 1 × 1 × 2 cm piece in the direction of growth, the wood strips washed repeatedly with pure water, and then soaked in 1 M HCl for 24 h. It was then placed in an oven for 12 h drying. Secondly, the transition elements were doped by using 15 mL ultrapure water and adding NiCl2·6H2O and FeCl3·6H2O under stirring with a magnet. The pre-treated wood blocks were then immersed in a metal salt solution for 30 min, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried samples were placed into a tube furnace, heated at 5 °C/min to 800 °C for 3 h in H2/Ar gas atmosphere, then cooled and removed. 2.2 Materials characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation). The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Jeol JSM-6500F equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer operated at a voltage of 15 kV. 2.3 Electrocatalytic measurements All electrocatalytic measurements were carried out using a three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (Zahner iM6e). Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode, and a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode. 5 mg of samples and 10 μL 5 wt% Nafion solution were put in a 0.8 mL mixture of water/ethanol with a volume ratio of 3:1 and dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. After that, 30 μL of this ink was carefully dropped onto a carbon paper (CP) of an area of 1 × 1 cm2 five times and dried in air. Line sweep voltammograms (LSV) polarization curves were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV/s over a potential range of 1 to 2 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) at various scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mV/s) were collected in the 1.0–1.1 V vs. RHE range. Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can be estimated by CV measures. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at a potential of 1.555 V vs. RHE with frequencies of 0.1 Hz to 100,000 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV. A Randle's equivalent circuit model was fit to the data to determine the system resistance and capacitance. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis process of NiFe/C involves three steps as shown in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the wood was soaked in 1.0 M HCl to remove the possible organic compounds. Then, the acid-treated woodblock was impregnated with a mixed solution of NiCl2 and FeCl3 to obtain precursors containing Ni2+ and Fe3+. Finally, NiFe/C was obtained by carbonizing the precursor at a high temperature (800 °C) in H2/Ar gas atmosphere. Microscopic morphologies of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1b, numerous nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the plate-like wood structure. The partially enlarged SEM image displays that the nanoparticles were spherical. High magnification SEM images show that spherical nanoparticles were connected forming a three-dimensional network structure (Fig. 1c) [26]. The average size of the nanoparticles was about 30 nm by measuring 100 nanoparticles (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the samples with different Ni:Fe ratios were also synthesized by adjusting the atom ratio of Ni/Fe in the precursor solution, and the corresponding samples were named Ni/C, Ni2Fe/C, NiFe2/C, and Fe/C respectively. Corresponding characterization results revealed that the changing metal ratio of the alloy had no obvious influence on the structure and morphology of the catalysts (Fig. S1). EDX was used to confirm the ratio of Ni and Fe elements in NiFe/C samples (Table S1). The results showed that the atomic ratio of Ni:Fe in the NiFe/C sample was close to 1:1, which was consistent with the addition ratio of the precursor salts. Additionally, mapping characterization results also demonstrated the presence and even distribution of C, Ni, and Fe (Fig. 1e-h). To further determine the phase composition, powder XRD characterization was performed. As for the sample with no metal loading, shown in Fig. S2, the XRD results showed that the two large envelope peaks correspond to the (002) and (101) crystal planes of graphitic carbon, and no other peaks appeared, which proves that the material is pure carbon. The peaks at about 43°, 50°, and 74° belong to (111), (200), and (220) planes of the fcc crystal planes (PDF#47–1405), respectively (Fig. 1i). Compared with the diffraction peaks of pure Ni (PDF#04–0850) and Fe (PDF#52–0513), the diffraction peaks of the samples are shifted slightly, as shown obviously in the partially enlarged pattern of the strongest diffraction peaks (111), which further illustrates the successful preparation of NiFe alloys (Fig. 1j) [27]. It can be seen that the peak of C changes from diffuse scattering peak to sharp peak with increasing in the proportion of Fe in NiFe alloy, indicating that the presence of Fe promotes the transformation of C from the amorphous structure into graphite structure [28]. In addition, no diffraction peaks corresponding to impurity were observed, indicating that the prepared sample had a single-phase [29]. In addition, the effect of calcination temperature on the structure and morphology of the sample was also investigated. Figs. S3 and S4 display the powder XRD and SEM results of the samples with different calcination temperatures. It was found that only at 800 °C single-phase and uniform NiFe/C nanomaterials were obtained. A typical three-electrode system was applied to estimate the OER electrocatalytic performance of seven samples via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements in an N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode and a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode. 5 mg of samples and 10 μL 5 wt% Nafion solution were put in a 0.8 mL mixture of water/ethanol with a volume ratio of 3:1 and dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. After that, 30 μL of this ink was carefully dropped onto a carbon paper (CP) of an area of 1 × 1 cm2 five times, and dried in air. As presented in Fig. 2a, pure carbonized wood showed the worst catalytic activity, and the catalytic performance was significantly improved after introducing metal, indicating that the pure carbonized wood only acted as a porous conductive carrier [30]. Additionally, the activity of the sample loaded with binary metal was higher than that of the samples loaded with single metal. The incorporation of the second metal element can modify the active component, trigger the synergy between the two metals in the same crystal array, thus leading to improved catalytic performance [31,32]. Among the three samples loaded with binary metal (Fig. 2a-b), NiFe/C has the best OER activity, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is only 259 mv, which is smaller than that of Ni2Fe/C (402 mV) and NiFe2/C (368 mV). The activity of NiFe/C is significantly better than the commercial catalyst RuO2 (290 mV) measured under the same conditions. The performance of C is poor, indicating that the conductivity of the three-dimensional porous carbonized wood is positively correlated with the catalytic performance of the system. The order of the Tafel slopes for the samples loaded with metal was Ni/C (236.6 mV/dec) > Fe/C (126.9 mV/dec) > Ni2Fe/C (102.2 mV/dec) > NiFe2/C (99.21 mV/dec) > NiFe/C (77.24 mV/dec) (Fig. 2c). A smaller Tafel slope represents faster reaction kinetics, and the above results are consistent with the performance of the LSV curve. Besides, the activity of the NiFe/C is also significantly larger to some recently reported OER catalysts (Fig. 2d), demonstrating its excellent activity. To reveal the origin of the difference in the catalytic performance of different catalysts, the electrochemical active area (ECSA) of different samples and the charge transfer resistance during the reaction were analyzed. The results shown in Fig. 2e suggest that the NiFe/C has the largest electrochemical active area (43.22 mF/cm2), larger than that of Ni/C (0.52 mF/cm2), Fe/C (1.01 mF/cm2), Ni2Fe/C (6.50 mF/cm2), NiFe2/C (10.10 mF/cm2), and C (0.17 mF/cm2), which can provide the largest number of active sites. As shown in Fig. 2f, NiFe/C exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance, consistent with its superior OER activity. Therefore, the excellent catalytic performance of NiFe/C can be attributed to the synergetic contribution from the carbonized three-dimensional porous wood frame structure and the optimization of alloy composition, which can facilitate mass/charge transfer and optimize the adsorption ability for intermediates, thus leading to significantly improved OER performance. Long-term stability is as important parameter as the catalytic rate for an expected industrialization. The durability of the catalyst NiFe/C was tested by applying a constant potential in 1.0 M KOH for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 3a, there was no obvious decay in the current density. By comparing the LSV curves before and after the stability test, it was found that the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 after the stability test has not changed, and was still 259 mV, indicating its excellent stability. This excellent stability comes from the in-situ growth of NiFe alloy on a three-dimensional porous conductive carbon substrate to form a self-supporting electrode structure, which effectively inhibits the accumulation of active materials due to anchoring [33]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the spherical shape has no obvious change and agglomeration after the durability test. Besides, the element distribution diagram (Fig. 3c-e) further proves the good dispersibility of the alloy nanoparticles. 4 Conclusion A wood-derived OER electrocatalyst (NiFe/C) had been synthesized by simple impregnation and high-temperature pyrolysis approach. The composite materials perfectly inherit the regular and open microchannel structure of natural wood. Benefiting from the incorporated well-dispersed NiFe nanoparticles and conductive carbon substrate, the as-synthesized NiFe/C electrodes exhibited excellent catalytic activity for OER, affording a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 259 mV. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent stability, which can keep stable for 12 h at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work may open a new avenue to synthesize non-precious metal/carbon hybrid electrocatalysts on a large scale using biomass-based carbon source.

        "dc:description": "Inspired by the 3D hierarchical porous structure and abundant hydroxyl groups of wood, we used basswood as a biological template to synthesize NiFe/porous carbon (C) through an impregnation and pyrolysis strategy. The optimized NiFe/C composite exhibited an impressive low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. More importantly, the catalyst had an extremely good durability. This study provides an alternative strategy to utilize green wood-based materials to design highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.",
