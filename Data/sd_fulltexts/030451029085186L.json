Butadiene monoepoxide was found to give but-2-enal through rearrangement catalyzed by [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 [2, 3]. This was a consequence of the rapid isomerization of the initially formed but-3-enal [3]. Methyl-substituted homologues behaved similarly [3]. By contrast, it was later reported that in the presence of catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4, 1,3-diene monoepoxides rearrange to dienols and/or to (3,7-unsaturated ketones, depending on the structure of the substrate [4, 5]. In this latter case, therefore, the rearrangement afforded the thermo- dynamically less stable product. For instance, when cyclopentadiene mono- epoxide was used as the substrate (Scheme 1, la) only cyclopent-3-enone 2a Pd(0)-Catalyst Scheme 1. a n = 1 b n=2 and no cyclopent-2-enone 3a was formed. The same catalytic system, how- ever, was found to give the a,j3-unsaturated aldehyde in the rearrangement of a carbohydrate-derived vinyl epoxide (2,2-dimethyl-5-epoxyethyl-l,3,4- trioxa-5-bicyclo[3.3.0]octene) [6]. The same type of selectivity, i.e. the formation of the a,(3-unsaturated aldehyde 2-methylbut-2-enal, had been pre- viously observed in the rearrangement of 3,4-epoxy-3-methylbut-l-ene brought about by the Pd(acac)2/PPh3 (acac = acetylacetonate) catalytic sys- tem [7]. The Pd(0)/PRs (PRs = PPha and/or PCyPhz) catalytic system *Present address: 'Studio di Consulenza Scientifica', 1-22060, Sirtori (Co), Italy. Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 0304-6102/90/$3.50 L2 promotes the rearrangement of 3,4-epoxybut-2-enyl phosphates and 3,4- epoxycyclopent-2-enyl phosphates to mixtures of conjugated and uncon- jugated carbonyl products, depending on the solvent and on the ligand [8]. Furthermore, it was recenly reported that RhH(PPh3)4 is a selective catalyst for the formation of a,(3-unsaturated carbonyl compounds from 1,3-diene monoepoxides; however, it was found to be ineffective for cyclopentadiene monoepoxide [9]. We report here our preliminary results on the palladium-catalyzed rear- rangement of 1,3-diene monoepoxides which show that the selectivity for these catalytic systems strongly depends on the type of ligand used, and is kinetic in origin. The results obtained with cyclic epoxides are reported in Table 1, whereas those concerning the rearrangement of non-cyclic diene epoxides are reported in Table 2. Rearrangements carried out using PPh3 as the ligand produce, as already reported [3], the thermodynamically less stable isomer. On the contrary, when l,2-dimethyl-l,2-ethanediyl-bis(diphenyl- phosphine) is the ligand, the more stable isomer is produced with high selec- tivity. l,2-Ethanediyl-bis(diphenylphosphine) and l-methyl-l,2-ethanediyl- bis(diphenylphosphine) show an intermediate behaviour. Cyclopentadiene monoepoxide la is isomerized by the aforementioned palladium system to cyclopent-2-enone 3a in about 24 h at room temperature (isolated yield ~65%). The same catalytic system under the same reaction conditions is able to isomerize 2a to 3a with a very low reaction rate (~ 15% in 5 days). Consequently the formation of 3a is not due to a rapid isomerization on the first formed 2a. TABLEl.

Cyclohexadiene monoepoxide shows a similar reactivity; in this case, however, also with the catalyst containing l,2-dimethyl-l,2-ethanediylbis- (diphenylphosphine) some cyclohex-3-enone is still formed. Also the two non-cyclic diene epoxides examined (Table 2) gave different products de- pending on the ligand used. With Pd/l,2-dimethyl-l,2-ethanediylbis(di- phenylphosphine) the a.^-unsaturated aldehydes were formed (about 20% yield referred to isolated products); with Pd(PPti3)4 a dienol like those pre- viously reported (4] or an unidentified polymeric product was isolated. It is interesting to note that, independently from the chemoselectivity, both catalytic systems seem to open the epoxy ring with the same regioselectivity. We suggest the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 2 as a working hypothesis to explain the reported results. This mechanistic proposal is based on the assumption that the regioselectivity of the first attack of the catalyst is independent of the ligand used [4] and takes into consideration the fol- lowing observations: (i) in the rearrangement of propylene oxide by Rh(PMe3)3Cl, the cis-acetonylhydrido complex has been isolated [10, 11]; (ii) reductive elimination of acetone from that complex proceeds by prior dissociation of a phosphine ligand [11, 12]; (iii)the chelation power of the three bidentate ligands used increases with increasing methyl substitution on the Cz-backbone between the two phosphorus atoms [13,14]. In Scheme 2 the differences in selectivity for the different catalysts used should be determined by the relative rate of paths a and b from inter- L4 Scheme 2. mediate 4, and therefore influenced by the ease of ligand dissociation. In fact, it has been found that for the four-coordinate planar d8 palladium(II) compounds related to 4, reductive elimination is easier from the corre- sponding three-coordinate complex. Thus ligand dissociation to a 14-electron intermediate a implied [15]. For the reaction under investigation, when triphenylphosphine is the cocatalyst facile dissociation of a ligand should promote path a. By contrast, dissociation of a phosphorus atom appears more difficult when the strongly chelating l,2-dimethyl-l,2-ethanediylbis- (diphenylphosphine) is the ligand. Therefore, the system will evolve towards the most stable rearranged intermediate 5 (possibly through the intermediate formation of an T^-allyl 18-electron intermediate or transition state) before reductive elimination. The l-methyl-l,2-ethanediylbis(diphenylphosphine) and l,2-ethanediylbis(diphenylphosphine) ligands will exhibit intermediate behaviour. If our interpretation is correct, the reported results are a further example [16] of a general principle for tailoring chemoselectivity in catalytic reactions by playing on the bond strength or on the chelating ability of the ligand.
