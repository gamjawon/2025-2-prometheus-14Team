Alekseev et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 ( 1994) 217-233 interpreted by the creation of mixed active sites at the metal-oxide interface con­sisting of metal atoms and carrier (promoter) ions [ 1-7] . Transition metal oxides of Group IVB, particularly Ti02, have most frequently been used as supports or promoters for rhodium [ 1,2] . Among the Group VB metal oxides, the effect of vanadium oxides as promoters or supports on the activity and selectivity of rhodium in CO hydrogenation has been studied extensively [8-13]. Ithas been shown that Rh/Si02 catalysts which were promoted by VOx, developed very high oxygenate selectivities [ 9-11] and this property was related to a partial coverage of Rh0 metal particles by VOx islands [ 10,11]. Thus, an intimate contact between the Rh0 metal and the VOx promoter is required. A possible route toward silica supported Rh0 catalysts developing intimate contact with the VOx promoter was shown to be the intermediate formation of the ternary mixed oxide Rh V04 [8,14,15]. It has been inferred that the formation of C2+-oxygenates is favoured at the metal/promoter interface [4-7,16-23] and it was suggested that C-and 0-bonded carbon monoxide of the form Rh-CO~Mex+ would play an important role as an intermediate in the oxygenate synthesis, since it is inserted into metal-carbon bonds to form surface acyl intermediates [4, 17,24]. Such C-and 0-bonded CO species have in fact been inferred for several catalyst systems from their extremely low carbonyl stretching frequency [5,15,20,22,25-29]. However, Koerts and van San­ten [ 13] have recently shown by transient kinetic experiments, that the insertion rate of CO into Rh-C bonds was not enhanced by a VOx promoter. Niobium oxide has found much less attraction as a promoter oxide for Rh/Si02 catalysts, although it has been shown that intimate contact between Rh0 metal particles and niobium oxide on silica supports could be induced by the intermediate formation of the ternary RhNb04 phase [ 30-33]. Rasband and Hecker [ 34] reported carbonyl infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on rhodium supported on niobia­modified Si02• The aim of the present work is to study the influence of Nbn + ions on the chemisorption of CO on Rh/Si02 catalysts by means of FTIR spectroscopy. Attempts have been made to produce catalysts with maximum possible dispersion of the rhodium particles and to achieve an intimate contact with niobium ions. As a synthetic route for this purpose, the (Rb+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts were prepared by the so-called ''surface assembling'' method using organometallic precursors [5­7]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation ofcatalysts The silica used as support had a BET surface area of 200 m2I g and Fe impurities of < 0.01 wt%. It was dehydrated in vacuum at 823 K prior to its use. Tris-7T-allyl O.S. Alekseev et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 ( 1994) 217-233 rhodium was synthesized from di-µ-chloride (hexa-1,5-diene) rhodium and allyl­magnesium chloride as described by Powell and Shaw [ 35] and purified by vacuum sublimation. Tetrakis-7T-allyl niobium was prepared by interaction of NbC15 with C3H5MgCl according to a procedure described in [ 36]. A 1.6 wt% Rh/Si02 catalyst was obtained by reaction in toluene of (C3H5hRh with hydroxyl groups of Si02 followed by further reduction in hydrogen at 523-773 K. (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts were prepared by the following procedure [5-7): ( 1) Reaction of silanol groups of the Si02 support with ( C3H5 ) 4Nb in n-pentane solution [ 37]. (2) Reduction of the resulting sample in hydrogen at 573 K to remove the organic ligands and to obtain Nbn+ ions of the lowest possible oxidation numbers [37]. ( 3) Chemisorption of ( C3H5 hRh from toluene on Nbn +ISi02• (4) Reduction of Jhe resulting (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 materials in hydrogen at 523­ 773 K. All catalysts were prepared without air contact. 2.2. Gases The gases used for chemisorption and sample treatments were from Linde AG, Germany. H2 was 99.999% pure and passed over an Oxisorb cartridge prior to use. CO and 0 2 were 99.993% and 99.995% pure, respectively, and used without further purification. 2.3. Chemisorption studies The chemisorption studies were performed in a flow-pulse apparatus with chro­matographic analysis. To completely remove organic contaminations, the catalysts were treated in air at 523 K, reduced in hydrogen at 523-773 K and subsequently evacuated at the reduction temperature at 10-3 mbar. Adsorption of H2 and CO was carried out at 293 K. Oxygen chemisorption took place at 293 and 473 K with subsequent hydrogen titration at 373 and 473 K for Rh/Si02 and (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts, respectively. 2.4. FTIR studies The FTIR studies were carried out on a Bruker IFS-66 spectrometer. Spectra wererecordedat85-523 Kin the 1400-4000cm-1 range with a 1.5 cm-1 resolution and averaging of 64 scans. The prereduced catalyst powder was pressed into self­supporting wafers (ca. 10 mg/cm2), placed into the IR cell, treated in situ in flowing hydrogen at 523-773 K, subsequently evacuated to 10-6 mbar, and finally cooled under vacuum to 85 K. Carbon monoxide was adsorbed at pressures increas­ 3.

Alekseev et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 217-233 experimentally confirmed by several authors [5,15,20,22,25-29]. Hence, the absorption bands detected now at 1704 and 1652 cm-1 can be attributed to Rh­CO-Nbn + complexes probably having two different oxidation numbers of the Nbn+ ions. Such C-and 0-bonded CO complexes were observed for all (Rh+Nb)/Si02 catalysts after reduction at 673 and 773 K. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the integral intensity of absorption bands at 1704 and 1652 cm-1 on the temperature of CO adsorption on a ( 1.6% Rh+ 1.9% Nb) ISi02 catalyst after reduction at 673 K. The intensity of the absorption band at 1704 cm -1 is a maximum at 223 K and completely disappears at 293 K. The absorption band at 1652 cm-1 reaches max­imum intensity at 253 K, while at 293 K the intensity decreases to approximately 50% of its original value. Fig. 4 shows the effect of reduction temperature on CO chemisorption over supported Rh and (Rh+ Nb). The spectrum of CO adsorbed on the 1.6% Rh/Si02 catalyst reduced at 523 K (Fig. 4, spectrum 1) is very similar to the spectrum of the same catalyst reduced at 773 K (Fig. 4, spectrum 3) although the band at 1901 cm -1 is more pronounced after low temperature reduction. The spectrum of CO adsorbed on the (1.6% Rh+ 1.9% Nb)/Si02 catalyst reduced at 523 K, differs from that of the unpromoted Rh sample by a high-frequency shift of the absorption band of linearcarbonyls to 2081 cm-1 and by the appearance of a weak absorption band at 2182 cm-1 of one Nbn +-CO complex (Fig. 4, spectrum 2). Note that the band at 1652 cm -1 characteristic of the tilted species is not present on this sample after reduction at low temperature. An increase in reduction temperature to 773 K reveals new distinctions between the spectra of CO on modified and unmodified rhodium catalysts (Fig. 4, spectra 4 and 3). There is a more pronounced high­frequency shift of the absorption band of linear carbonyls to 2087 cm-1 and the symmetric stretching band of a tricarbonyl species at 2118 cm-1 [63] and the ::i oi > ..... ·c;; c: Q) ..... c: 100 200 300 Temperature I K Fig. 3.

There is a pronounced difference between the absorption band positions observed in the region of bridging carbonyls and those reported for the Rh3 (CO) (1863 cm -1) and Rh2 (CO) ( 1915 and 1897 cm -1) surface species [ 54] . It may thus be speculated that these bands and a shoulder at 2094 cm -1 indicate the formation of molecular rhodium clusters, although the spectra do not perfectly match those of molecular analogues [51-53]. Fig. 5 shows the effect of the metal/ promoter ratio on the nature of IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the catalysts after reduction at 773 K. Ifthe Rh/Nb atomic ratio increases from 0.33 to 1.37, the intensity of absorption bands increases with the spectral characteristics remaining almost unchanged, although the intensity ratios of several bands (namely those at 2084 and 2093 cm-1) do vary (Fig. 5, spectra 2-4).

Stability ofCO chemisorbed on (Rh+ Nb )/Si02 Fig. 6 shows the spectral response on interaction of CO chemisorbed on the ( 1.6% Rh+ 1.9% Nb) /Si02 catalyst with hydrogen. Brief evacuation of a sample after CO adsorption at 293 K and Pea= 100 mbar, leads to certain changes of the carbonyl spectra (compare spectra 1 and 2 in Fig. 6). In particular, the bands at 2118 and 1879 cm-1 disappear, the intensity of the band of terminal CO ligands at 2086 cm-I is reduced and a new band at 2107 cm-1 grows in. Hydrogen added at a static pressure of 50 mbar or flowing H2 at 293 K does not lead to any further detectable change in the spectra in the carbonyl region (see spectra 3 and 4 in Fig. 6). The disappearance of the band at 2118 cm -1 can be interpreted as being due to a transformation of the Rh+ (CO) 3 into the Rh+ (CO) 2 complexes. The symmetric stretching mode of the latter species is identified as the band at 2107 cm-1 which grows in parallel to the erosion of the band at 2118 cm-1• The antisymmetric I'\")\"'<!\" en oo I 00 NN !! 0.5 ]0.1 N CXl c:::i CD I 0 c a ..c ..... 0 Ul ..c <( I 2176 2300 2100 1900 1700 1500 Wavenumbers / cm-1 Fig. 5.

I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 217-233 stretching mode is presumably masked by the relatively intense cluster band at 2046 cm-1• When the temperature is further increased to 323 K under flowing H2 (spectrum 5 in Fig. 6), the intensities of the bands at 2094, 2086 and 1915 cm-1 are clearly decreased, while the band at 1652 cm -1 of C-and 0-bonded CO-species vanishes. At 373 K a new band at 2063 cm -1 appears (spectrum 6 in Fig. 6). Spectrum 7 of Fig. 6, taken after treatment at 423 Kin flowing H2, reveals that bridging carbonyls almost quantitatively vanish while terminal CO ligands are still present, as indicated by the bands at 2046 cm -1 with a shoulder at 2063 cm -1• The band at 2107 cm-1 characteristic of Rh+ (CO) 2 complexes is also substantially depleted at the same temperature. Finally, all carbonyl bands disappear when the temperature reaches 473 Kin flowing H2• The band at 1613 cm-1 which first appeared at 323 to 373 K and which is resistant to temperatures as high as 523 K is probably due to chemi­sorbed water moh;cules or carbonates, that may form during the thermal treatments of the catalyst. It is noteworthy that the bands at 2094 and 1847 cm -1 appear simultaneously after high-temperature reduction of this (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalyst (see Fig. 2) and they seem to disappear simultaneously in flowing H2 between 373 and 423 K (see spectra 6 and 7 in Fig. 6).

It is also interesting to note that the band at 1652 cm -1 characteristic of the C-and 0­bonded CO-species vanishes in parallel to the bands of this second cluster species, indicating perhaps that some of the bridging ligands of this cluster undergo the Lewis acid-base interactions with Nbn + sites. Fig. 7 presents carbonyl IR spectra characterising the behaviour between CO chemisorbed on the (0.7% Rh+ 1.9% Nb)/Si02 catalyst atpc0 = 100 mbar and 293 K in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen exposure at 293 K does not produce spectral changes (Fig. 7, spectra 2,3), while a temperature increase to 373 K results in a complete disappearance of the absorption bands of the bridging, linear and C­and 0-bonded carbonyls, while the intensity of the absorption bands of the dicar­bonyls remains practically unchanged. This result is entirely consistent with the data reported by Kiss and Gonzalez [ 42]. Fig. 8 shows the dependence of the relative intensity changes of various absorp­tion bands of CO adsorbed on the ( 1.6% Rh+ 1.9% Nb) /Si02 catalyst which was reduced at 523 K, as the oxygen pressure is varied.

As in the above case (Fig. 7), twin carbonyls practically do not react with oxygen. The reactivity of bridged carbonyls towards oxygen exceeds that of the linear carbonyls. 4. Discussion According to several literature reports [ 41-43], the position of the absorption band of terminal CO species on Rh/Si02 varies within the range 2080-2040 cm -1• High frequency shifts of this band upon increasing the CO coverage arise primarily from dynamic dipole interactions in the adsorption layer on extended faces [ 55]. Alternatively, high carbonyl frequencies are also expected for CO chemisorbed on small metal particles exposing surface atoms with low coordination numbers. With the 1.6% Rh/Si02 catalyst, a relatively high band position of the linear CO species is detected at 2075 cm-1 at room temperature. This high carbonyl frequency probably arises from a high degree of dispersion of rhodium in catalysts of organo­metallic origin. When the CO pressure was increased from 0.1 to 100 mbar, the position of the absorption band of terminal CO adsorbed on a 1.6% Rh/Si02 at 83 K (Fig. 1, spectra 1, 2) remains unchanged at 2081 cm -1• The constant high frequency position of the carbonyl stretching band suggests a small size of Rh particles ( vide supra). The formation of individual carbonyl clusters from Rh particles in CO atmosphere at 373 K (Fig. 1, spectrum 4) is also indicative for the high Rh dispersion. These qualitative conclusions are completely verified by the quantitative chemisorption data reported above which indicate that the rhodium dispersion in the 1.6% Rh/Si02 catalyst remains extremely high up to the reduction temperature of773 K.

Hydrogen treatment of such complexes at 673 K leads to a complete removal of organic ligands and to the formation of isolated surface Nbn + ions in low oxidation states [37,56]. Absorption bands at 2194 and 2182 cm-1 in spectra of CO adsorbed on (Rh+ Nb) ISi02 catalysts are evidence for the existence of two types of Nb ions in different oxidation states and/or coordination environments [57] . The observed increased oxygen uptake on these catalysts suggests oxidation of low-valent Nbn + ions (Table 1). Table 2 summarizes some literature data obtained for CO adsorption on Rh/ Si02 catalysts modified by various ions of Group IV-VII transition elements. The carbony 1 IR spectra ofCO adsorbed on the present (Rh +Nb) ISi02 catalysts exhibit the following remarkable features as compared to those ofunpromoted Rh/ Si02: (a) a high frequency of the absorption band of terminal CO species at 2087-2084 cm-1; ( b) appearance of two absorption bands ofC-and 0-bonded CO at 1704 and 1652 cm-1; ( c) appearance of narrow absorption bands presumably of molecular carbonyl clusters even at 293 K; ( d) appearance of absorption bands at 2194 and 2182 cm-1 characteristic of Nbn +-CO complexes. Moreover, the presence of Nbn + ions induces a decrease of the CO-and H­uptakes on Rh. The effects mentioned become more pronounced with increasing reduction temperature of the (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts. The detection of two absorption bands at 1704 and 1652 cm -1, indicating the formation of specific sites for CO .adsorption, is a major result of this work. Similar O.S. Alekseev et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 ( 1994) 217-233 low-frequency carbonyl stretching bands in the range 1700-1500 cm -1 were pre­viously reported for supported Rh which was promoted by titanium, zirconium-, vanadium-, niobium-and manganese oxides [ 26,29,58-61]. With niobia-promoted Rh/Si02 catalysts, an absorption band at 1620 cm-1 was reported by Ichikawa et al. [ 58], but it was not observed by Kraus et al. [54]. This discrepancy probably arises from both the different rhodium dispersion and the different degrees of interaction of components of the catalysts due to different preparation conditions. Typically, (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts did not show any high-frequency shift of terminal CO species with increasing CO coverage, while a partial disintegration of metallic particles in CO even at 293 K led to the formation of gem-dicarbonyl species. Combined with results of hydrogen titration, these data witness a high rhodium dispersion. The appearance of absorption bands at 1704 and 1652 cm -l which are attributed to the C-and O~bonded CO, suggest a close proximity between Rh atoms and surface Nbn + ions so that C-and 0-bonded species of the type Rh-CO-+ Nbn + or (Rh) 2CO -+ Nbn + can be formed. The formation ofthese adducts must be activated as they can only be detected at temperatures above approximately 130 K. The observation of two types of C-and 0-bonded CO correlates with the presence of two types of low-valent Nbn + ions. The low CO-and H-uptakes and the high frequency of the carbonyl bands of terminal CO species in (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 cata­lysts may arise from an intimate interaction between Rh-particles and Nbn +-0 species consistent with the bonding mechanism of CO. Since bands characteristic of molecular carbonyl clusters develop under the same conditions, their involve­ment in the formation of C-and 0-bonded carbonyls cannot be excluded. It is also interesting to note that marked changes occur in the bridging carbonyl bands in the 1900 cm-1 region at increasing temperature in the presence of CO. These may be interpreted as being due to CO-induced morphological changes of small Rh particles [39,54]. At 373 K, terminal, bridging and C-and 0-bonded CO on (Rh+Nb)/Si02 catalysts can be eliminated by oxygen, while the gem-dicarbonyl species appear to be unreactive under these conditions. This result is fully consistent with data reported by Kiss and Gonzalez [ 42]. The stability of the various chemisorbed forms of CO relative to oxygen decreases in the series (Fig. 8): Twin CO> Linear CO~Bridging CO. C-and 0-bonded CO on (Rh+ Nb) /Si02 catalysts appears to be the least stable when exposed to hydrogen. For the possible function of C-and 0-bonded CO in syngas conversion on promoted Rh, it has been suggested: ( 1) to decrease the activation energy of CO dissociation with subsequent forma­tion of CHx fragments inserting in the growing hydrocarbon chains [ 62] ; (2) to facilitate CO insertion into the CH3-Rh bond yielding the acetyl interme­diate CH3CO for acetaldehyde and ethanol production [ 24,62]; ( 3) to increase the rate of hydrogen atom addition to chemisorbed CO resulting in generation of formyl species, which are the precursors for methanol syn­thesis. O.S. Alekseev et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 217-233 A quantitative correlation between TON of methanol synthesis on (Pd+ E) I Si02 catalysts (E=Zr,Pr) and the absorption band intensity of tilted CO was reported earlier [5,7]. Promoters are known [ 1,2] to accelerate not only the for­mation rate of Cz+-hydrocarbons and Croxygenates on Rh/Si02 but also that of methanol; thus, each of the above three effects may occur in these catalysts. The present results seem to indicate some reactivity of the C-and 0-bonded CO species. However, the existence of this species under actual reaction conditions and its kinetic relevance still remain to be proven.

(Rh + Nb)/SiO2 catalysts were obtained by anchoring of nanometer size Rh particles on surface low-valent Nb n + ions. These materials exhibit the following specific features compared to Rh/SiO2: a low Rh surface coverage by chemisorbed hydrogen and carbon oxide; a high-frequency shift of linear CO absorption band and appearance of two absorption bands of a C- and O-bonded CO at 1704 and 1652 cm−1. On exposure to H2, the stability of surface carbonyls increases in the sequence: Rh-CO-Nb n + < Rh-CO ≤ Rh2(CO) < Rh+(CO)2. The possible role of C- and O-bonded CO complexes in the conversion of syngas on supported rhodium catalysts promoted by transition element oxides is discussed.
