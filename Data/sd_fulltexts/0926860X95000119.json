Taylor et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 287-296 to methanol at remote sources of extraction would be possible; the methanol product could then be transported for use in urban centres. The direct conversion has proved to be an extremely demanding reaction, due to the harsh conditions required to activate the methane molecule, and the thermodynamic instability of the desired products, with respect to those of combustion. Numerous catalysts have been tested for this reaction but, to date, none have exhibited any outstanding performance [l-4]. The majority of catalysts which have shown some success for this reaction have been oxides. Clearly it is important that methanol should be stable over any potential catalysts, under appropriate conditions. This study was undertaken to investigate methanol stability over a wide range of oxide materials. Previous studies concerned with methanol oxidation have tended to concentrate on the production of formaldehyde, not the stability of methanol. The types of catalysts used in these studies were often multicomponent complex oxides. This can make the identification of suitable materials difficult. By studying the interaction of methanol with a range of single oxides, we aim to identify types of materials over which methanol possesses the required degree of stability, and hence are suitable components on which to base the design of improved catalysts. 2. Experimental Methanol oxidation studies were carried out in a conventional laboratory microreactor. Helium (99.995%) and oxygen (99.5%) were used as diluent and reactant respectively. Flow-rates were regulated by Brooks needle valve flow controllers, up stream pressure regulators ensured a constant pressure was maintained. In-line rotameters gave an approximate indication of the gaseous flow rates, which were accurately determined using a bubble flow meter. Methanol (BDH, AnalaR grade) was introduced to the reactor via a syringe pump into a Pyrex vaporiser maintained at 100, where it was mixed with oxygen and helium in the required ratios. The reactor was a fused silica tube (8 mm internal diameter) with ground glass fittings to permit removal of the tube for catalyst charging. Heating was by a furnace capable of maintaining temperatures in the range 100-520, with a 50 mm uniform heated zone. Reaction temperatures were determined by a thermocouple placed in intimate contact with the furnace and the reactor tube. The catalysts were pelleted to a 0.6-1.0 mm uniform particle size range before loading. The catalyst bed length was typically 10 mm, and was secured in the reactor tube by silica wool plugs. The reactant feed composed of methanol/ oxygen/ helium in the ratio 1 /4/ 12, with gas hourly space velocities in the region of 12 000 h-', at 1 atm pressure. Methanol oxidation experiments were carried out in the temperature range 150-500. Product analysis was by on-line GC-MS, fitted with a thermal conductivity detector, in series with a Varian Saturn Mass Spectrometer. The transfer line from S.H.

Results In total 33 different oxides (Table 1) were tested and characterised. These materials were selected on the basis of potential interest as catalysts, based on 290 S.H.

In addition, it was our intention to examine a wide range of the periodic table. Surface area measurements show a large variation, ranging from 278 m' g-'for Si02 to less than I m2 g-' for several of the materials. By X-ray diffraction it was found that the majority of materials were present as a single phase. The exceptions were A1203, Ga203, Nb205, Pr60,, and Ti02which were a mixture of two or more phases. All the oxides were highly crystalline except Si02, which was a fumed silica, and A1203 which exhibited transitional phases [ 5 ] . The crystallinity of cobalt and iron oxides could not readily be determined due to the contributions from fluorescence since a Cu K a source was used. For methanol oxidation a wide range of stabilities was found, but in many cases the selectivity to products followed similar patterns. On this basis it was possible to group oxides together, Table 2 shows the resultant groups. The oxides in group 1 showed high methanol conversion at relatively low temperatures. Products from the reaction were almost exclusively carbon dioxide, in some cases carbon monoxide was also observed at selectivities less than 3%. Materials in group 2 also exhibited selectivity exclusively towards carbon oxides, but unlike those in group 1, carbon monoxide selectivity was considerably higher across the range of conversion. In the region of low conversion some selectivity towards oxygenated products was observed, particularly in the case of MgO, Mn203, NiO and the lanthanide oxides. The percent pass yields of these products were extremely low, and only observed at temperatures below 300. Oxides belonging to group 3 showed appreciable selectivity to formaldehyde and dimethyl ether. The oxides C0304, Fe203 and V205 produced formaldehyde, while A1203, Ga203, Ti02 and Zr02produced dimethyl ether. However, a common feature of all these oxides was that carbon oxides were produced exclusively above 400. Oxides classed in group 4 showed high selectivity to oxygenated products at all levels of methanol conversion. These oxygenated products were dimethyl ether and formaldehyde. At lower temperatures dimethyl ether was the main product. Increasing the temperature, and consequently conversion increased formaldehyde and carbon oxide selectivity. At the highest temperature investigated formaldehyde was the most selective product. The oxides in this group are very closely related in the S.H.

It is interesting to note the similar behaviour of Nb205 and Ta205, in contrast to that of VZO5, which gave high selectivity to formaldehyde only at low conversion. Group 5 contained M003 exclusively, over which methanol conversion increased from zero at 300 to around 90% at ca. 500. Across this range of conversion, selectivity to formaldehyde remained high, decreasing to ca. 97% at the highest temperature. 292 S.H.

Comparison between methanol conversion over W05, M003, Ta'05, W03 and Sb203. Sb203was the sole oxide in group 6, in contrast to all the other oxides methanol was exceptionally stable over this material. The conversion was extremely low throughout the temperature range investigated. Between 250-400 dimethyl ether was the exclusive product, whilst above 450 this selectivity decreased steadily until it reached zero at 500. Above 450 formaldehyde was produced, and some selectivity to carbon monoxide was also noted at 500. The wide range of results obtained from these oxides make comparisons for the suitability of different catalysts complex. To rationalise this information we have devised a ranking order to compare performance, which has been based on the temperature at which 30% of the reactant methanol feed was converted to carbon oxides (T3o). This ranking is shown in Fig. 1. In many cases the actual methanol conversion at this temperature was considerably higher, since products other than CO., were also formed. However, we consider these products to be acceptable by-products to methanol in any methane oxidation process, i.e. formaldehyde and dethyl ether. Although the surface areas of the materials vary considerably ( Table 1) , no endeavour has been made to normalise for such effects. It is considered that the surface areas of these oxides are typical of those expected in any catalyst formulation. Ranking the performance in S.H.

Similar rankings were produced if data were ranked for other levels of CO_, production. The worst performance was shown by Cr.,03 with a T3, of 175. There was a large grouping of materials in the low to mid-range of To values. The best performance for methanol stability were shown by five oxides; N05, MoO3, S03, Ta205 and W03, which were clearly superior to the others investigated. In particular it was not possible to rank Mo03, Sb103 and WOE on this scale, since with these oxides very low yields of CO, were always obtained. The methanol conversion and pass percent yields of carbon oxides, in the temperature range 400-500 for these five oxides are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. As previously mentioned it was evident that conversion over Sb203 was considerably lower than the other oxides. Relatively good performance was also shown by Ta205. Conversion over W03 proved to the greatest, lying in the range 90100%, between 400-500. The yield of carbon oxides over Sb203 was very small, as a consequence of the low conversion. No carbon oxides were detected at or below 450, and at 500 the yield was less than 0.5%. MoO3 presented comparable results with no carbon oxides detected below 400, this increased to 0.5% at 450 and 2.5% at 500. 294 S.H. Taylor et al. /Applied Catalvsis A: General 726 (/995) 287-296 N05, Ta20, and WO3 all gave similar results, the yields obtained were significantly higher than those obtained from MoO,3 and Sb203. These yields were approximately 5% at 400, and 10% at 450. At 500 the yields had increased significantly, lying in the range 22-31%, W03 showed the lowest and Nb205 the greatest. 4. Discussion The substantial number of oxides employed in this study permits the possibility for common trends to be examined for the methanol decomposition reaction. We have examined the data for relationships between the ability of an oxide to produce CO, from methanol with a range of physical and chemical properties. In particular data have been compared with nearest metal-oxygen distance, nearest oxygenoxygen distance, unit cell volume, and metal ionic radius, but no correlations were found. This is not surprising, since the oxides have metal ion valencies ranging from 2 + to 5 + , and belong to different crystallographic systems, therefore exhibiting a broad range of surface structures. Taking into consideration these discrepancies, and grouping together oxides with similar valencies and crystal types did not improve the situation. The product distribution may in some cases be related to the acidic or basic nature of the catalyst. Acidic materials, which in this study include A1203, Ga203, Ti02 and Zr02, produced dimethyl ether, which is the recognised dehydration product from the corresponding alcohol, methanol. However, for other materials which can be considered to be acidic, for example W03, the case is less clear. W03 produced dimethyl ether at lower temperatures, while formaldehyde was produced as the temperature was increased. This is in line with the known oxidation behaviour of tungstates [ 6] . The production of formaldehyde may be expected from a dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by basic materials. Strongly basic materials, e.g. MgO, CaO and the lanthanide sesquioxides, produced mainly carbon oxides, with very little selectivity to formaldehyde. The lanthanide sesquioxides exhibit a well defined decrease in basicity across the group, in line with decreasing metal ionic radii [ 7 ] . No trends were detected between the affinity of an oxide for methanol conversion with basicity. In general the basic oxides all belong to groups 1-4 in our classification, these groups generated mainly carbon oxides. The oxides may also be categorised according to their electrical conductivity characteristics, e.g. insulators and semiconductors. The semiconductor oxides are extrinsic semiconductors, produced by their deviation from specific stoichiometry. The materials which are extrinsic semiconductors include both n-type and p-type. These differences do not seem to influence the conversion or product distributions, as in many cases insulators, n-type and p-type oxides produce similar results. The oxygen exchange over oxides has been previously studied [ 8,9 ] . Three mechanisms of exchange were identified, R, and R2 correspond to exchange of S.H. Taylor et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 287-296 295 Log oxygen exchange rate at 350 C/ g 17 C` 15 Mn203 Nd203 LaL203 1 13 \"- D Fegp3 c Cr203 0 Cdi ,7Gd203 I Y203 Mg 0 1 1 Sm203 Ceo, 2 P~bO Zr02 Sn?2 `1V b203 Zn0 9 Ga1203 A1203 i 7- Nb205 Ta 2 5 5 1_L __- :._ i __ 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Temperature for 3096 conversion to COx/ Fig. 4. Correlation between oxygen exchange rate and temperature for 30% methanol conversion to carbon oxides. gaseous oxygen with the oxide surface, either by an atomic or molecular reaction. The third mechanism, R3, operated via surface exchange, both R, and R, but rapid oxygen diffusion throughout the oxide produced exchange with the whole of the bulk and not merely the surface. A plot of oxygen exchange rate for R, and Rz mechanisms at 350, corrected to represent 1 g of oxide, against Tao is shown in Fig. 4. The data shows a weak but significant correlation, as R = 0.472 is significant at the 98% level for two independent variables. Closer examination, taking into account crystal group and metal valency, did not improve correlation. It is interesting to note that Nb205 and Ta205, which are two of the best oxides, showed the lowest activity for oxygen exchange. On the other hand CuO, which readily decomposed methanol, was one of the most active materials, hence the weak correlation may be important for the design of improved catalysts. This study emphasises just one of the problems involved with the partial oxidation of methane to methanol, that is the instability of the product. With the exception of Sb203, methanol was unstable over all of the materials under conditions employed in our experiments. Over some materials formaldehyde and dimethyl ether are relatively more stable products. Over M003 formaldehyde was a particularly stable molecule. M003 based catalysts have been extensively studied for the partial oxidation reaction at atmospheric pressure with molecular oxygen oxidant [ 10] . With these molybdenum supported catalysts formaldehyde is the predominant valuable product. We have performed further experiments showing that a 5% molybdenum oxide silica supported catalyst exhibited very similar behaviour to bulk M003 for methanol oxidation. 296 S.H. Taylor et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 287-296 It is therefore a minor point of debate as to whether formaldehyde is formed via a methanol intermediate from sequential oxidation or via a direct route. Certainly under the conditions which we have employed any primary methanol produced from methane would be rapidly converted before diffusing out of the catalyst bed. Precautions can be taken to assist the preservation of methanol, for example decreasing contact times may be of value. A selectivity switch from methane coupling products to formaldehyde has been observed over MgO when the space velocity was increased [ 11 ] . This switch was accompanied by a decrease in selectivity to carbon oxides. Additionally the injection of water has also been employed in a effort to preserve methanol, by quenching gas-phase reactions. Such a technique was used by Dowden and Walker [ 12] : water was injected post catalytic bed, in order to quench reaction products to 200 within 0.03 s of leaving the bed. These approaches may aid preservation, but ultimately it would be more beneficial to produce catalysts over which methanol is inherently more stable. This study presents considerable data covering methanol stability over simple oxide catalysts. These data are relevant to the scientific design of catalysts for direct methane partial oxidation to methanol, since it is crucial that surfaces are identified that do not decompose methanol to carbon oxides. This approach may be used as a first step in the successful design of novel catalysts for this demanding conversion. In addition the data are weakly correlated with the rate of surface oxygen exchange and it can be expected that improved catalyst formulations should be based on M003, Nb205, Sb203, Ta205 and W03.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic partial oxidation of methane to methanol has proved to be an extremely demanding reaction. It is clearly important that methanol should be stable over any potential catalysts, so a systematic study has been undertaken to determine the types of oxides over which methanol might have the required stability. The results should be valuable for the design of future catalysts. Methanol stability by catalytic oxidation has been investigated in the temperature range 150–500°C and 1 atm pressure. Over the majority of materials a substantial proportion of methanol was converted to carbon oxides below 350°C. Several oxides exhibited improved performance, these were MoO3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5 and WO3. Methanol conversion over these materials was high, but the major products were formaldehyde and dimethyl ether. Sb2O3 showed the best performance, producing a methanol conversion of only 3% at 500°C. The results have been compared with both physical and chemical properties of the oxides in an attempt to establish trends. In particular we have looked at relationships with oxygen exchange data. A weak but significant correlation between methanol decomposition to carbon oxides and the rate of oxygen exchange is discussed.",
