Graphical abstract A porous conductive interlayer (PCI) is developed to homogenize Li-ions flux and suppress the growth of lithium dendrites by its porous structure and the formation of an equipotential surface during cycling. Lithium (Li) metal, possessing ultrahigh theoretical capacity and the lowest electrode potential, is regarded as a promising new generation anode material. However, the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites during cycling process gives rise to problems as capacity decay and short circuit, suppressing the cycling and safety performances of Li metal battery. In this contribution, porous conductive interlayer (PCI), composed of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamine (PMIA), is developed to suppress Li dendrites and stabilize Li metal anode. PCI possesses the excellent conductive ability of CNFs and the preeminent mechanical properties of PMIA at the same time. When Li metal contacts with PCI during cycling process, an equipotential surface forms on their interface, which eliminates the tip effect on Li anode and homogenizes Li-ions flux in combination with the uniform porous structure of PCI. Employed PCI, the Li|Cu cell exhibits a remarkable cycling stability with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 97.5% for 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2. And the Li|LiFePO4 cell exhibits improved rate capability (114.7 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C) and enhanced cycling performance (78.9% capacity retention rate over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). This work provides a fresh and effective solving strategy for the problem of dendrites in Li metal battery. Keywords Li metal battery Li dendrites Porous conductive interlayer Equipotential surface 1 Introduction Lithium-ion battery (LIB) has good energy storage capacity, long life stability and heat resistance. Since commercialized by Sony in 1991, LIB has been widely used for decades and extended to a wider range of areas, including electric vehicles, power tools and energy storage units [1,2]. However, with the development of these industries, the demand for energy density of energy storage equipment is increasing. At present, the graphite anode in LIB system has accomplished its theoretical capacity (372 mAh g−1) nearly, far from the requirements of electric vehicles batteries yet [3]. Therefore, it has become the focus of current research to develop anode materials with high capacity, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) anodes [4–9]. Li metal has received widespread attention and been one of the most promising anode material candidates because of its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and the lowest electrode potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrodes) [10,11]. However, Li metal anode has some unresolved serious problems, which hinders the practical application of lithium metal battery (LMB) [12,13]. During the cycling process, the repeated plating/stripping of Li brings a huge volume change and morphological changes, which causes the breakage of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of Li metal anode and the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li [14,15]. Unstable SEI and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth lead to liquid electrolyte consumption and risk of short circuit, which cause poor electrochemical performance and safety problems [16–18]. In recent years, a lot of efforts have been done by researchers to solve these problems, which are mainly focused on electrolyte engineering [19–23], lithium metal anode modification [24–30], functional interlayers design [31–36] and current collector design [37–42]. Designing a coated functional interlayer is one of the simplest methods to enhance the cycling and safety performances of LMB, which makes it possible for LMB to be commercialized. Coating some inorganic nanomaterials, polymer or mixture of them on the surface of commercial separators as functional interlayers [43–46], lithium dendrites can be suppressed effectively due to the high ionic conductivity, chemical thermal stability, good mechanical strength and three-dimensional micro structure of interlayers, and lithium metal anodes will be stabilized at the same time [47,48]. In the contribution, a porous conductive interlayer (PCI), composed of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamine (PMIA) with a mass ratio of 2:3, is developed as a functional interlayer between commercial polypropylene separator (PP) and Li metal anode in LMB. The PCI owns some favorable characteristics including excellent ionic and electronic conductivity, high mechanical strength, eminent flexibility and good wettability with liquid electrolyte, which credits to the excellent film-forming property of PMIA and excellent electrical conductivity of CNFs. As shown in Fig. 1 , some dendrites form in the early stage of charging. Without PCI, Li ions prefer to deposit on these dendrites and aggravate the growth of them due to the tip effect (Fig. 1a). Employing PCI, on the contrary, an equipotential surface forms when Li dendrites make contact with the PCI due to the conductive network composed of CNFs in PCI, which contributes to eliminate the tip effect of Li dendrites and achieve uniform Li deposition under the action of electrostatic force (Fig. 1b). When PCI is applied, Li|Cu and Li|Li cells exhibit enhanced cycling stability (a high average Coulombic efficiency of 97.5% for 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2) and prolonged cycling life (1000 h at 1.0 mA cm−2) significantly. And Li|LiFePO4 (LFP) cells with PCI exhibit much better rate capability and enhanced cycling performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamine (PMIA) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were purchased from Tianjin Bodi Chemical Engineering and Xianfeng Nano Materials Technology Co., Ltd., respectively. Li metal obtained from Beijing General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals are used as received. The ether-based electrolyte of 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)-1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/ Dimethyl ether (DME) (1:1 by volume) with 2 wt% LiNO3 and carbonate-based electrolyte of 1.0 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)-ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume) were all purchased from Shanghai Songjing New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and Lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl·H2O) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) were purchased from Shenzhen BTR Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of CNF/PMIA interlayer The interlayer of CNF/PMIA was prepared by phase inversion method and was coated on commercial polypropylene separator (Celgard 2500, PP) by a doctor blade coating method. Firstly, the 8 wt% (to the solvent) LiCl·H2O was dissolved in 20 mL dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Then 3 wt% polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamine (PMIA) was added to the solution and stirred at 80 °C for 12 h to form PMIA solution. After that, added the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) into the PMIA solution and continued to stir for 12 h to form CNF/PMIA slurry. The mass ratios of CNF and PMIA were controlled to be 0:3, 1:3, 2:3 and 3:3 (called PMIA, 1CNF/3PMIA, 2CNF/3PMIA and 3CNF/3PMIA, respectively). The PP separator was modified by direct coating of CNF/PMIA solution on one side of it by the doctor blade coating method. Placed the prepared slurry in a defoaming machine for 10 min under a pressure of − 0.1 MPa. After bubbles being completely removed, the slurry was scraped on the surface of PP to be a membrane. The scraped membrane was soaked in the coagulation bath composed with DMAc and deionized water for 1 h to prepare the interlayer by a phase inversion method. During this process, the DMAc in the CNF/PMIA slurry and the deionized water in the coagulation bath exchanged and the PMIA translated from liquid phase to solid phase gradually. The interlayer was then washed with alcohol and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. 2.3 Electrode preparation For Li|LFP cells, the cathode was prepared through a doctor blade coating method. In details, LFP powders, Super P conductive carbon black and PVDF binder were mixed (with a mass rate of 8:1:1) in NMP solvent to form slurry and the slurry was further blade coated on Al foils and then dried at 70 °C for 24.0 h. After drying, roll-pressed cathode foils and punched them into circular disks. The mass loading of LFP was about 1.0 mg cm−2. 2.4 Characterizations The micromorphology of the samples was observed with field-emission SEM (Quanta FEG 250, FEI, America). The crystallinity of CNFs was identified by an X-ray powder diffractometer (X’Pert PRO MPD, PA Nalytical, Holland). Raman characterization of CNFs was done with a Laser micro-Raman spectrometer (inVia-Reflex, Renishaw, England). 2.5 Electrochemical measurements The CR2025 coin-type cells were used for the assembly of all the cells and the assembly process was accomplished in an argon-filled glove box (MBRAUN, MB-MO-SE1, H2O < 0.5 ppm, O2 < 0.5 ppm). A PP or a PP with interlayer was used as separator in all the cells. Etherbased electrolyte was utilized in Li|Cu and Li|Li cells, and carbonated electrolyte was utilized in Li|LFP cells. The CNF/PMIA interlayer was placed between Li anode and PP. For Li|Cu cells, the discharge time of 1.0 h (for 0.5 mA cm−2, 0.5 mAh cm−2)/0.5 h (for 1.0 mA cm−2, 0.5 mA cm−2) and charge cut-off voltage of 0.5 V were fixed for the lithium plating and stripping process during each galvanostatic cycle, respectively. For Li|Li cell tests, the separator was sandwiched between two Li foils. Both charging and discharging process were cut off with a fixed time of 1.0 h (for 1.0 mA cm−2, 1.0 mAh cm−2) / 0.5 h (for 2.0 mA cm−2, 1.0 mAh cm−2). To evaluate the rate capabilities in Li|LFP full cells, the current densities were varied from 0.2C to 5.0 C (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0C). Besides, the cells were controlled to cycle at 1.0 C to evaluate the cycling performance. 3 Results and discussion In this work, four kinds of interlayers with different contents of CNFs were fabricated by phase inversion method and coated on PP separator. Among them, the 2CNF/3PMIA interlayer was chosen as the porous conductive interlayer (PCI), and the PMIA interlayer was chosen as a comparison. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), a good deal of interconnected holes distribute on the surface and inside of the PMIA interlayer evenly, bringing about a high porosity and specific surface area, and the thickness of the PMIA interlayer is only about 3 µm (Fig. 2b). After adding some CNFs, the PMIA covered on the surface of CNFs, resulting in a higher porosity (Fig. 2c) and a larger thickness (~5 µm, Fig. 2d). As shown in Fig. 2(c), some CNFs are observed in the PCI, indicating that a complete conductive network has formed in the interlayer. The microscopic appearance of 1CNF/3PMIA is similar to that of PCI, but no CNFs are observed (Fig. S1a), indicating the conductive skeleton formed by CNFs is not complete. When the mass ratio of CNFs and PMIA is increased to 3:3, the CNFs occupied most of the space of the interlayer and the solvent exchange mainly occurred in PMIA during the phase inversion process, bringing about the conformation of serious agglomerated CNFs (Fig. S1b). The agglomerated CNFs result in uneven physical and chemical properties of the interlayer. Therefore, 2:3 is an appropriate mass ratio of CNFs and PMIA. Dropping a drop of liquid electrolyte on the surface of PP and PCI, the liquid droplets on PCI was absorbed quickly, and exhibited a much smaller contact angle (9°) than the bare PP (55°) (Fig. S2), indicating that the PCI had excellent wettability to the liquid electrolyte, which facilitated Li-ions transport and reduced the internal resistance of cells. As shown in Fig. S5(a) and Table S1, the ionic conductivity of PP separator is 0.585 mS cm−1, and the ionic conductivity decreases when coated the interlayer of PMIA (0.454 mS cm−1) and 1CNF/3PMIA (0.376 mS cm−1). The reason is that the pore structure of interlayer prepared by phase inversion is an asymmetric structure, and the interlayer exhibits a lower porosity on the side in contact with PP compared to the other side (Fig. S3), thus limiting the transport of Li ions. Besides, the interlayer increases the thickness of the separator, thereby increasing the distance and resistance of ion transport. With the augment of CNFs concentration, ionic conductivities of PP with PCI and 3CNF/3PMIA increase to 0.501 mS cm−1 and 0.639 mS cm−1, respectively. Because of the certain pore-forming ability of CNF, the pore structure of interlayer became more uniform and reasonable with the increase of the CNFs concentration, causing a higher ionic conductivity. It indicates that the CNF/PMIA interlayer can provide a channel for Li ion transport as a part of separator in LMB. The XRD and Raman were employed for CNFs, and spectra (Fig. S4) evidenced that CNFs were highly graphitized carbon material with some disordered graphite structures, owning excellent electrical conductivity. The electronic conductivity was measured by four-probe method. The PP and PMIA are insulation, so conductive path is provided by CNFs. Being added 1/3 CNF into the PMIA, the electrical conductivity of interlayer is only 0.003 S cm−1, because the CNFs are too few to connect tightly and form a complete conductive network in the interlayer. When the content of CNF is increased to 2/3, a complete conductive network has formed in the interlayer and the electronic conductivity becomes 0.413 S cm−1 (Table S2). The electronic conductivity of 3CNF/3PMIA is 0.567 S cm−1, increasing only 0.154 S cm−1 compared with PCI, because some of CNFs are agglomerated rather than forming a denser conductive network. As shown in Fig. S5(b) and Table S1, the tensile fracture stress of bare PP is about 126 MPa, and it increases by about 21% to 153 MPa after coated the interlayer of PMIA, owning to the excellent mechanical properties of PMIA. The tensile fracture stress of the PP with 1CNF/3PMIA is 144 MPa, about 6% lower than the PP with PMIA interlayer. Since CNFs and PMIA are two different phases, the interface of CNFs and PMIA are simple physical interweaving bonding with a low strength, causing that the tensile strength of the composite film is slightly lowered. The tensile fracture stress of the composite film changes little with the increase of the content of CNFs. The fracture stress of the PP with PCI and 3CNF/3PMIA are 145 and 140 MPa respectively, because the agglomeration of CNFs in 3CNF/3PMIA reduced the mechanical strength. Although the addition of CNF caused the reduced mechanical strength of composite film, there is still an 11% to 15% increase in tensile fracture stress compared with bare PP. It shows that the CNF/PMIA interlayer can improve the mechanical properties of separator effectively, and the PMIA plays a decisive role. The interlayer with excellent mechanical properties can be used as a physical barrier to prevent dendrites from piercing the separator and causing short circuit. To investigation the thermal stability of separator, bare PP and PP with different interlayers were cut into square samples (15 mm × 15 mm) and placed for 30 min at different temperatures (100 ~ 180 °C). The shrink of separator mainly occurred in the lateral direction (Fig. S6b), thus the shrinkage was estimated by the side length in this direction. As shown in Fig. S6(a), PP with PMIA and PCI exhibited similar shrinkage, much smaller than that of bare PP, and PP with PCI started to shrink until 140 °C with the shrinkage of only about 3.33%, indicating that PCI contributed to improving the thermal stability of separator. To reveal how Li metal anode is stabilized by PCI, micro morphologies of deposited Li on Cu foils in Li|Cu cells are investigated. When the capacity of deposited Li is 0.3 mAh cm−2, Li dendrites with similar morphology are observed both on Cu foils with/without PCI (Fig. 3 a, d). With the capacity of deposited Li increased to 0.5 mAh cm−2, Li dendrites in cell without PCI continued to grow and became larger due to the tip effect (Fig. 3b). However, Li dendrites in cell with PCI stopped growing and Li deposited in the gaps between Li dendrites uniformly (Fig. 3e), proving an equipotential surface formed on the interface and leaded to uniform Li deposition. After 10 cycles, an interlaced dendritic morphology is observed on Cu foil without PCI, and the deposited lithium surface is broken (Fig. 3c). When PCI is used as the interlayer, there is almost no dendritic morphology or cracks on the surface of Cu foil, showing a uniform and smooth deposition surface (Fig. 3f), indicating that PCI has a good inhibitory effect on lithium dendrites. To further reveal the impact of PCI, the coulombic efficiency (CE) is used to evaluate the cycling stability of Li|Cu cells with different interlayers at an areal capacity of 0.5 mAh cm−2. At a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), the cell without interlayer can only maintain a relatively stable CE (97.8% in average) for less than 60 cycles and then decreases sharply, which results from the consumption of electrolyte and the formation of dead Li due to the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites during cycling process. The CE of cell with PMIA interlayer is similar to the cell without interlayer. In contrast, after employed PCI, the Li|Cu cell exhibits a longer stable cycling life of 100 cycles with an average CE of 97.5%, showing that PCI is able to stabilize Li metal anode effectively. When the current density is improved to 1.0 mA cm−2, the effect of PCI becomes more obvious. The cell with PCI exhibits a stable CE (93.2% in average) for more than 100 cycles while CE of the cell without interlayer reduces to 66.1% dramatically after 65 cycles (Fig. 4a). The cell with PMIA interlayer also shows a worse CE (84.3% in average for 100 cycles) than cell employed PCI. When the PCI is replaced by 1CNF/3PMIA and 3CNF/3PMIA interlayers, the life of Li|Cu cell is also enhanced but not as well as that by PCI (Fig. S7), which are due to the incomplete conductive skeleton in 1CNF/3PMIA and the uneven porous structure of 3CNF/3PMIA. When the PMIA interlayer is used, the life of Cu|Li cell is extended much less than that prolonged by CNF/PMIA interlayer, because there is no conductive network to form an equipotential surface in PMIA interlayer and it can only homogenize the Li-ions flux through its uniform porous structure. Through the comparison between different interlayers, CNFs in the CNF/PMIA interlayer play an important role in the inhibition of Li dendrites and 2CNF/3PMIA (PCI) is the best choice among three kinds of CNF/PMIA interlayers, which is attributed to its complete conductive network and uniform porous structure. Fig. 4(b, c) shows the voltage profiles of cells with different interlayers during the 20th and 70th cycles at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. The voltage hysteresis of three kinds of cells changes little during different cycles, and the PP with PCI exhibits the smallest voltage hysteresis, indicating that the PCI is beneficial to forming a more stable interface on Li metal anode. Voltage-time profiles of Li|Li cells were measured at a fixed areal capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2 to further evaluate the impact of PCI on the cycling performance. As shown in Table S3, the cell without interlayer exhibits a polarization voltage of 176.7 mV at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 during the initial cycle, slightly smaller than cells with PMIA (204.6 mV) and PCI (202.1 mV). The interlayer increases the distance of Li-ions transport and so enlarges the resistance of separator slightly, resulting in the little increase of polarization voltage. The polarization voltage of cells dropped and maintained gradually within 100 h (Fig. 5 a), indicating that the interface between Li anode and separator became stable gradually. Nevertheless, the polarization voltage of the cell without interlayer starts to increase gradually after 600 h, and expands drastically at 700 h (Fig. 5a). The increased polarization voltage indicates the formation of a highly resistive interface layer mainly composed of electrolyte decomposition products and dead Li [49]. On the contrary, the cell with PCI exhibits a prolonged cycling life of 1000 h with highly stable voltage curves, indicating a more stable Li metal anode. When the current density is increased to 2.0 mA cm−2, the cell can still cycle stably over 500 h with the protection of PCI (Fig. 5b). While PMIA interlayer dose not perform as well as PCI. The cell with PCI exhibits a much better cycling stability than the cell with PMIA and bare PP, suggesting the superior ability of PCI for suppressing Li dendrites and stabilizing Li metal anode. Beside half-cell studies, Li|LFP cells were also assembled to reveal the effect of PCI in full-cells. Fig. 6 shows the cycling performance and rate capability of Li|LFP cells employed bare PP and PP with PMIA or PCI as separators. Before cycling, there was a precycling step for 2 cycles at a current density of 0.2C. Cells employed bare PP and PP with PMIA or PCI exhibit similar interfacial impedance after assembly (Fig. S8, 0 h), indicating that PMIA and PCI do not increase the impedance of cells obviously. As shown in Fig. S8(a, b), the interfacial impedances of cell without interlayer and cell with PMIA increase significantly with a resting for 5 h, and the increase of them becomes even larger after precycling. On the contrary, the interfacial impedance increase of cell with PCI is much smaller (Fig. S8c), indicating that the PCI is able to stabilize the Li metal anode and promote the formation of a stable SEI effectively. As shown in Fig. 6(a, b), cells employed bare PP and PP with PMIA or PCI exhibit similar initial capacities (138.5, 145.5 and 147.0 mAh g−1, respectively) and high average CEs of above 99% for 120cycles at 1.0C. While the capacity and CE of cell employed bare PP start to decrease at 120th cycle and drop sharply after 150 cycles, which can be put down to the consumption of electrolyte resulting from the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li during Li plating/stripping process. As shown in Fig. S9(a), lots of cracks and dendrites are observed on Li anode of cell without interlayer after 150 cycles, further confirming the above statement. After 320 cycles, cell with PMIA also suffers significant attenuation of capacity and CE, and an irregular morphology was observed on Li anode after 500 cycles (Fig. S9b), indicating that PMIA interlayer without CNFs can not protect Li metal anode effectively. By contrast, cell with PCI exhibits enhanced cycling performance for over 500 cycles (with 78.9% capacity retention and a high average CEs of 99.0%) and Li anode maintains a smooth surface after cycling (Fig. S9c), further proving that Li dendrites are suppressed availably and Li anode is greatly stabilized by PCI. Due to the stable physical and chemical properties of PMIA, PCI could maintain its original morphology largely after 500 cycles with only slight swelling (Fig. S10). A stable Li metal anode conduce to achieve excellent rate performance of the cell with PCI. As shown in Fig. 6(c), reversible capacities of 161.2, 156.2, 149.3, 139.6, and 114.7 mAh g−1 are observed at various current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 C respectively, higher than cells with PMIA interlayer and without interlayer, and the capacity restores to 160.9 mAh g−1 when the current density returns to 0.2 C. The enhanced rate performance is attributed to the stable interface on Li anode and the small change of interfacial impedance of cell during cycling. The performances of Li|LFP cells further reveal that PCI can suppress Li dendrites and stabilize Li metal anode effectively. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed a porous conductive interlayer (PCI) through the rational mixture of CNFs and PMIA by the phase inversion method, which combines the excellent conductive ability of CNFs and the outstanding mechanical properties of PMIA at the same time. When Li metal is in contact with PCI during Li deposition process, an equipotential surface forms between PCI and Li metal anode, which eliminates the tip effect on Li metal anode. In combination with the uniform porous structure of PCI, it is able to homogenizes the Li-ions flux and suppress the growth of Li dendrites effectively. The Li|Cu cells and Li|Li cells with PCI show an extended cycling life and enhanced cycling stability. Employed PCI, Li|LFP cells exhibit excellent rate performance and prolonged life of 500 cycles with a high average CE of 99.0%. The development of a porous conductive functional interlayer supplies a new thought about achieving Li dendrites suppression, Li metal anode stabilization and eventual practical applications of LMB.

        "dc:description": "Lithium (Li) metal, possessing ultrahigh theoretical capacity and the lowest electrode potential, is regarded as a promising new generation anode material. However, the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites during cycling process gives rise to problems as capacity decay and short circuit, suppressing the cycling and safety performances of Li metal battery. In this contribution, porous conductive interlayer (PCI), composed of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamine (PMIA), is developed to suppress Li dendrites and stabilize Li metal anode. PCI possesses the excellent conductive ability of CNFs and the preeminent mechanical properties of PMIA at the same time. When Li metal contacts with PCI during cycling process, an equipotential surface forms on their interface, which eliminates the tip effect on Li anode and homogenizes Li-ions flux in combination with the uniform porous structure of PCI. Employed PCI, the Li|Cu cell exhibits a remarkable cycling stability with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 97.5% for 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2. And the Li|LiFePO4 cell exhibits improved rate capability (114.7 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C) and enhanced cycling performance (78.9% capacity retention rate over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). This work provides a fresh and effective solving strategy for the problem of dendrites in Li metal battery.",
