Graphical abstract A magnetically separable catalyst was designed for the production of value-added benzaldehyde. Palladium (Pd) nanoparticles supported on iron-doped SBA-15 (MagSBA) were fabricated and applied as heterogeneous catalyst for solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol using molecular oxygen under atmospheric pressure without external base. The developed Pd/MagSBA showed excellent catalytic performance at comparatively low temperature range of 70–90°C. The catalyst made the oxidation of BzOH milder, purification simpler and less pollution caused. Effects of the palladium loadings, reaction temperature, and stirring rates on their catalytic activity of benzaldehyde conversion were studied. It was found that the designed catalysts were recoverable by simple magnetic separation and were reusable without significant loss of catalytic activity. In addition, the reaction kinetics of the catalytic oxidation was investigated, showing that the reaction was zero order and the calculated activation energy was 50.08kJ/mol. Keywords No external base Low temperature benzyl alcohol oxidation Solvent-free Reusable catalyst 1 Introduction Benzaldehyde (BzH) is widely used in the pharmaceutical, dyeing, perfumery, and agrochemical industries [1]. In a practical manufacturing process, the BzH is produced mainly via the routes of hydrolysis of benzyl chloride or oxidation of toluene [2,3]. However, the former approach would face significant chlorine contamination while the latter would result in poor product selectivity with rather high temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, a liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH), which is an alternative pathway for BzH production, has been selected and widely used [4,5]. A lot of work have been done for the homogeneous catalysis of BzOH [6–8]. Considering the easier purification, recovery and reuse, heterogeneous catalysis of BzOH is highly desirable for commercial application. Different oxidants (such as tertiary butyl hydrogen peroxide [9], H2O2 [10], O2 [11–13]), solvent medium (such as acetonitrile [9,14,15], para-xylene [16], toluene [12,13,17], water [13], or solvent free [13]), external weak and strong bases (such as hydroxides and carbonates [17,18]) and high pressure condition with autoclaves [13,19,20] have been studied for the liquid phase oxidation of BzOH. However, these additives and conditions will cause the problem of complicated purification and pollution. Thus, the characteristics of solvent-free reaction medium, molecular oxygen-based oxidants, as well as lower temperature, has drawn much attention from the public and widely accepted as a “greener” process for the production of BzH [21–23]. Nano-sized porous supports have drawn much attention in the past decade because of their characteristic roles as a catalyst carrier and commensalistic interaction with the active metal elements for heterogeneous catalysis. Highly porous supports allow metal nanoparticles to be evenly dispersed over the bulk material, providing ample of active sites for efficient catalytic reaction. In addition, the metal-support interaction might endow the catalysts with better performance and enhanced stability, mutually advancing the overall catalytic efficiency, as well as the product selectivity, for a target reaction. Magnetically separable nanocatalysts (MAGSNC) are in the limelight owing to the facile synthesis and simple separation for recovery and reusability in the continuous chemicals processing [24]. Generally, there are two approaches to develop MAGSNC-based catalysts, which are: (1) to synthesize magnetic materials as catalytic supports for noble metal nanoparticles [25], or (2) to coat magnetic nanoparticles with non-magnetic matter to form magnetic nanocomposites [26–28]. However, functionalization of non-magnetic materials with magnetically-active nanoparticles as an alternative approach to obtain magnetic nanocomposites has been rarely adopted. Recently, a straightforward and “solventless” synthetic mechanochemical protocol was proposed to functionalize mesoporous SBA-15 with magnetic nanoparticles [29]. Interestingly, palladium nanoparticles supported over the magnetically-functionalized SBA-15 (MagSBA) exhibited promising catalytic activities in aqueous coupling reactions [29]. An attempt was reported in the literature using magnetically recoverable palladium catalyst for solvent-free oxidation of BzOH with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant [23]. However, active MAGSNC for the solvent-free BzOH oxidation with molecular oxygen has not been reported hitherto [22,23,30–32]. In our work, we present the synthesis of Pd/MagSBA catalysts through impregnation and its application for the solvent-free oxidation of BzOH to BzH with molecular oxygen. The Pd/MagSBA showed excellent catalytic performance at 70–90°C, which was comparatively lower than those found in the literature. Moreover, the catalyst can effectively catalyzed the reaction without additional bases or high pressure condition. Effects of Pd loadings, reaction temperatures, and agitation rates of catalyst preparation on the catalytic performance have been explored. Besides, the catalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity. The kinetics of the catalytic oxidation was finally studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Palladium (II) chloride (PdCl2) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Benzyl alcohol was purchased from Xilong Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (China). All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of Pd/MagSBA catalysts The MagSBA was prepared by the same procedure in the previous study [29] and briefly described here. 0.5g SBA-15 and 1.34g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were grinded in ball mill vessel and were milled for 10min at 350rpm. The solid was reacted with propionic acid at 85°C for 3h under static vacuum. The composite was calcined in air at a ramping rate of 1°C/min and kept at 300°C for 0.5h. The Pd/MagSBA catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method where palladium (II) chloride was used as the precursor of palladium element. A known amount of palladium (II) chloride solution was impregnated into MagSBA materials for certain duration. The Pd/MagSBA catalysts were dried in a vacuum oven at 100°C for 12h and subsequently calcined at 300°C for 3h in hydrogen atmosphere. 2.3 Characterization of Pd/MagSBA catalysts Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy disperse X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed by a unit of Phillips Analytical FEI Tecnai 30 at an accelerating electron voltage of 300kV to analyze the morphology of developed catalysts. The TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the MagSBA and Pd/MagSBA materials in ethanol, dropping the supernatant onto carbon-coated copper grids and allowing ethanol to completely evaporate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted by an X'Pert Pro (PAnalytical) X-ray Diffractometer to study the crystallinity of developed catalysts. 2.4 Evaluation of catalyst activity Liquid phase oxidation of BzOH utilizing molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant was conducted in a magnetically stirred three-neck flask (10mL), which was equipped with a tubular reflux condenser. The flask was heated to a target temperature by a temperature-controlled oil bath. A total of 0.05g developed catalyst was stirred with 5mL BzOH with continuous oxygen bubbling by a glass rotameter at atmospheric pressure. Samples containing reaction products, as well as intermediates, were taken intermittently and solid catalysts were separated from the mixture by centrifugation. The liquid products were analyzed by a gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector using SE-30 capillary column. External calibration method was used for quantitative analysis of the amounts of reactants and products with BzH selectivity defined as the amounts of BzH produced divided by the amount of BzOH consumed [33]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization results of Pd/MagSBA catalysts The textural properties of the MagSBA and Pd/MagSBA materials with different Pd loadings are shown in Table 1 . The Pd/MagSBA possessed about 10% lower surface area than the bare MagSBA, due to the filling of Pd NPs in the mesoporous channels of MagSBA. Unexpectedly, the, pore diameter and pore volume of Pd/MagSBA increased with increasing Pd loading on MagSBA until 3wt% and then decreased. One possible reason might be that the samples are from different batch of preparation. The textural properties of the Pd/MagSBA materials were evaluated by N2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. S1, Supporting information), indicating that they kept Type IV isotherm profile of the mesoporous materials. As displayed in Fig. 1 , uniformly distributed small particles on hexagonally ordered SBA-15 with the particle size less than 10nm were observed in the TEM images of the as-prepared Pd/MagSBA catalysts. Fig. S2 proved the existence of Pd, Fe, Si and O as the elemental compositions of 4.0Pd/MagSBA. XRD analysis was conducted to determine the crystallinity, as well as the existence of iron NPs species, of developed catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Pd/MagSBA catalysts and bare MagSBA (without Pd metals). A plateau-patterned signal in the range of 22–25° was observed which was attributed to the amorphous silica phase from SBA-15 porous support. The indicative peaks at 45°and 83° of Pd loaded MagSBA were related to crystalline planes of (110) and (211) faces corresponding to Fe0 NPs [34], respectively. In addition, the peak at 35.5° found in the bare MagSBA, shows the presence of crystalline phase of (311) face of γ-Fe2O3 [29]. Such a difference in oxidation states of iron elements between the Pd-doped and non Pd-doped catalysts was mainly due to the hydrogen reduction. The Pd-loaded MagSBA catalysts were all chemically reduced in hydrogen atmosphere for 3h, causing the reduction of both palladium and iron elements at the same time. Consequently, all γ-Fe2O3 would be reduced to Fe0 NPs, giving different spectra in the XRD analyses. While for palladium element, since its loadings were so low (typical detection limit >5wt.%) or it was uniformly dispersed on the support, the distinct Pd peak was not observed. 3.2 Catalytic performances of Pd/MagSBA catalysts 3.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature The dependence of reaction temperature on the catalytic activity of the Pd/MagSBA catalysts was studied to determine robustness of the prepared catalysts. First attempt was conducted using 3.0Pd/MagSBA, achieving 70% of conversion and 85.3% of selectivity to BzH at 70°C after 23h (Fig.S3, Supporting information). In addition, a better performance, giving 89.1% of conversion and 81.1% of selectivity, could be achieved after 10h at 80°C, which is a slightly higher reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 3 . Further increasing the reaction temperature from 70°C to 90°C, both reaction conversion and product selectivity were slightly decreased, compared with those in the time frame less than 10-h reaction duration. Two byproducts, toluene and benzoic acid, were quantified to determine the reaction pathway and corresponding mechanism. From the catalytic results obtained at 70°C (Fig. S3), Supporting information), the BzH was firstly produced and toluene was subsequently formed. The formation of toluene could be due to the occurrence of disproportionation in the reaction. It was hypothesized that toluene intermediate would oxidize to form BzH directly or gradually transform into benzoic acid and would be subsequently oxidized to form BzH indirectly. The higher the reaction temperature, the shorter the reaction time to achieve high reactant conversion (Table S1). However, the high reaction temperature would accelerate the undesired reaction, which is the oxidation of BzH to benzoic acid, resulting in poor selectivity, as well as low yield of BzH. Therefore, there is always a trade-off between the catalytic activity and efficiency in this catalytic system. Besides, it is worthy to note that the developed Pd/MagSBA catalysts are able to transform the benzyl alcohol selectively to benzaldehyde at a lower temperature (80–90°C) than that reported in the literature [22]. 3.2.2 Effect of Pd loading The relationship between the active site density and the activity of Pd/MagSBA was investigated by studying the effect of Pd loading on their catalytic efficiency for the BzH synthesis. The evaluation tests were conducted using 2.0Pd/MagSBA at a temperature ranging of 80–90°C, as displayed in Fig. S4. Given the same reaction duration, the obtained conversions of BzOH using 2.0Pd/MagSBA in general were lower than that obtained by 3.0Pd/MagSBA. Given an apparent difference in active site density for activity comparison, four developed catalysts, known as 4.0Pd/MagSBA, 3.0Pd/MagSBA, 2.0Pd/MagSBA and 1.0Pd/MagSBA, were evaluated at the optimized temperature of 85°C. The correlations of conversion/selectivity versus reaction time based on these four catalysts with different Pd loadings were plotted in Fig. 4 . In general, it was observed that increasing Pd loadings from 1.0wt.% to 3.0wt.% (Fig. 4b–d) will significantly elevate the reactant conversions from 30% to 80%. It clearly shows that the higher the active site density, the higher the reactant conversion. However, this finding is no longer valid in the case of 4.0wt.% Pd/MagSBA, giving a lower conversion (<80%) compared to the case of 3.0wt.% Pd loading. This can be explained that over 3.0wt.% Pd loading, the extra palladium may not load onto the vacant site of the SBA15 support. Instead, the Pd element may be loaded onto the Pd nanoparticles, which were already present on the SBA15 support surface, giving an increase in particle size of deposited palladium without changing the active site density. In this case, the increased Pd loading only promotes the size of Pd particle in place of the density of active site. 3.2.3 Kinetic study on Pd/MagSBA-catalyzed benzyl alcohol oxidation Linear fitting of the reactant conversion versus the reaction time was conducted in Fig. 4 and the results show good agreements with experimental data for all 4 catalysts havinf different Pd loadings, suggesting that the reaction kinetics is zero order. The rate constants, which are the slopes of conversion vs time, were given in the histogram of Fig. 5 , indicating the fastest reaction was achieved in the case of 3.0Pd/MagSBA. As mentioned, the 3.0wt.% Pd was the optimum loading within the studied range of palladium loading. The maximum slope value reflects the fastest oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Further studies were conducted at different temperatures using 3.0Pd/MagSBA as a model catalyst to determine the activation energy, Ea . The corresponding reaction orders and reaction rate constants, k, are listed in Table 2 . It was found that the conversion of BzOH has a linear relationship with reaction time for all 4 temperatures, concluding that the reaction rate equation of the reaction is r =−(dx/dt) = k, which is a zero-order reaction. According to Arrhenius equation, ln k =ln A −Ea/(RT), where k, A, R, Ea , and T are the rate constant, Arrhenius constant, ideal gas constant, activation energy, and temperature, accordingly. The activation energy, Ea , was found to be 50.08kJ/mol. It is similar to the values found in the literature using the surface-functionalized TUD-1 mesoporous molecular sieve supported palladium catalyst (43.7–54.1kJ/mol)[38], and using the TiO2-supported noble metal catalysts (45.8kJ/mol)[39] in a solventless liquid phase reaction, respectively, as shown in Table 3 . 3.2.4 Recycling test Durability of the catalyst is an essential factor that should be considered when they are readily applied in industrial scale operation. The recycling test of the optimal catalyst, 3.0Pd/MagSBA, was studied. In each run, the catalyst was recovered by simple magnetic separation, and re-used in a subsequent new run without any regeneration. The catalytic performances were analyzed after 9h for each time and the recycling ability was tested for five consecutive cycles. In practical industrial application, the recoverability and reusability of catalysts are of great significance because it will simplify the designing and minimize the cost for the whole catalytic system. As displayed in Fig. 6 , the prepared catalyst was chemically stable for a long-term operation at least five consecutive runs, offering high conversion and remarkable selectivity of around 80% and 85%, respectively. Since our catalysts, which were doped by iron nanoparticles, it is capable to be recovered by simple magnetic separation from the treated effluent in the current system. With this unique property, the catalysts can be easily recycled and reused in a proper way. Obviously, the catalytic performance of the Pd/MagSBA catalysts is superior compared to those catalysts prepared by conventional chemical methods (DP, impregnation, etc.). As shown in Table 4 , high BzH yield and fair TOF values were simultaneously achieved with the Pd/MagSBA catalysts at a relatively low temperature of 85°C. Higher TOF values were usually obtained at very high reaction temperatures (>140°C) in the literature as the oxidation of BzOH is an endothermic reaction, high reaction temperature leads to more energy consumption. By comprehensive consideration, our work is more effective compared to other works in the conventional studies. 4 Conclusions A series of Pd nanoparticles loaded magnetic SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized and used as efficient catalysts for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with molecular oxygen at lower reaction temperatures. The optimized conditions are the catalyst of 3.0Pd/MagSBA having a Pd loading of 3.0%, a reaction temperature of 85°C at a stirring rate of 1000rpm (Fig. S5, Table S2). The catalysts were recycled and reused for five consecutive times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Besides, kinetics of the catalytic oxidation was studied and the activation energy was calculated to be 50.08kJ/mol. These findings prove that this catalyst not only improves the conventional conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity to benzaldehyde, but also exhibits excellent durability compared to current heterogeneous catalytic systems. Besides, it can simplify the purification process since the catalyst does not require solvent, liquid oxidant or external base for promoting purpose. Thus, the catalyst is desirable for industrial application. Acknowledgements The corresponding author greatly acknowledges the financial support of Initiation Grant (Project no.
