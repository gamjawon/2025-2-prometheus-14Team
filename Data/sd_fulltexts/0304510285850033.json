KUREK Institute of Chemical Engineering and Physical Chemistry, Cracow Poly technical Univer- sity, ul. Warszawska 24, 31-155 Cracow (Poland) (Received October 22,1984; accepted July 25,1985) Summary A chromium catalyst obtained by thermal decomposition of triallyl- chromium in heptane solution at 358 K is described. It proved to be active for hydrogenation of 1-alkenes at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. The kinetics of hydrogenation of 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of the above catalyst was studied. The initial reaction rate was affected only by the total chromium concentration and hydrogen partial pressure, and did not depend on the diene concentration. The system was completely inactive when the concentration of chromium was lower than about 25 mmol dm\"3. The rela- tionship between the initial reaction rate and the total chromium concentra- tion at constant hydrogen partial pressure was not typical: a straight line intersecting the abscissa. It could be explained assuming that the catalytic- ally active form occured in colloidal dispersion in equilibrium with an inactive soluble form. This was confirmed by other data. Introduction Chromium catalysts usually show rather low activity for hydrogenation of alkenes, in contrast to Group VIIIB metals, and have not been as widely investigated. For example, complexes of the type Cr(arene) ()3 catalyze hydrogenation of alkenes [1, 2], but even at elevated temperatures (380 K) and under higher pressure the reaction proceeded slowly. Recently, more active systems with chromium species immobilized on the surface of silica or alumina have been described. Iwasawa et al. [3] prepared a catalyst by fixing chromium allyl complexes either on silica or on alumina, followed by reduc- tion with hydrogen at higher temperatures. The authors claimed that the most active system obtained consisted of chromium atoms singly or in pairs bonded to the support via oxygen from the hydroxyl groups. Thomas and Brenner [4] studied a catalyst obtained by temperature-programmed decom- position of Cr(CO)6 sublimed onto v-M^Os. The catalyst activity for hydro- genation of propene expressed as formal turnover frequency was very high, 0304-5102/86/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 306 with a reported value of 0.15 s~1 at 273 K. However, when Hucul and Brenner [5] employed dehydroxylated alumina it was even higher, and reached a value of 0.9 s~1 at the same temperature. The authors claim that the oxidation state of chromium appears strongly to affect activity. The most active catalysts should have an oxidation state near zero. Here we report studies on a chromium hydrogenation catalyst obtained by thermal decomposition of triallylchromium in solution under conditions that do not give complete cleavage of the organic ligands. The obtained catalyst was active for alkene hydrogenation. Results We have noticed that after a few weeks of storage, solutions of triallyl- chromium became active for hydrogenation and isomerization of alkenes. Initial attempts indicated that the active system was obtained by heat- ing heptane solutions of Cr(l73-C3H5)3 at 333 K for 10 to 20 h and under reflux for about 1 h. When refluxed longer, a brown solid formed and the system lost its activity. For further experiments, 358.2 K was chosen as the temperature of thermal decomposition and 1,5-hexadiene as alkene, as it was already present in minor quantities in the system as one of the products of decomposition of Cr(7}3-C3H5)3 [6]. The studied catalytic system was also active for hydrogenation of 1- pentene,with a reaction rate the same as in the case of 1,5-hexadiene. However, the system appeared to be quite inactive for 2-pentenes [7]. Thus only 1- alkenes were hydrogenated in the presence of the described chromium catalyst. The catalyst was also inactive for hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones; the active system decomposed in their presence. Triallylchromium was prepared by the method of Oberkrich [8]; 1,5-hexadiene was obtained from allyl bromide and magnesium as described in [9]. During the thermal decomposition of Cr(173-C3H5)3 in heptane at 358.2 K, a rapid evolution of a gas (1.5 mol per Cr) was observed, mainly during the first hour of heating. The gas consisted almost entirely of propene (>99%). After the decomposition the solution was not clear, but no solid was observed. After cooling the reaction mixture to 298.2 K and evacuating, hydrogen (92 kPa) was admitted to the reactor. The gas was consumed slow- ly until about 0.25 mol Hz per Cr reacted. The length of time for this step depended on the duration of the thermal decomposition, and after 4 h heating it was equal to 1.25 X 103 s and after 7 h, 0.60 X 103 s. At this point the consumption of H; rapidly accelerated, and a constant rate was observed which did not change until the process almost stopped. The rate depended on the concentration of chromium and on the duration of the thermal de- composition. After a short heating period (3 h) it was two times lower than after the optimal duration of heating (4 - 6 h), and for longer heating times 307 it decreased slowly again. The rate of H; consumption was the same as that observed during hydrogenation after the addition of alkene. When alkene was not added, the consumption of Ha stopped after about 1.5 mol H; per Cr had reacted. After prolonged heating (8 h) only about 0.7 mol Hi per Cr was consumed. The amount of H; consumed agreed to some extent with the amount of Ha needed to hydrogenate 1,5-hexadiene produced during the thermal decomposition of triallylchromium. After prolonged heating, the amount of 1,5-hexadiene was much lower but probably some unsatur- ated oligomerization products of it were present. After a while (about 200 s), a slow consumption of hydrogen began again, and a black solid preci- pitated. Afterwards the system lost its activity for hydrogenation. 1,5-Hexadiene was added to the reaction mixture after the rapid con- sumption of hydrogen had started. The distribution of products of the hydrogenation reaction is summarized in Table 1. After 3 X 103 s, about 60% 1-hexene was present in the products. Other isomers were also present in the reaction mixture, but only those in quantities greater than 1% were taken into account. The effect of concentration of the diene, chromium and di- ethyl ether on the initial reaction rate was investigated under constant hydrogen partial pressure (92 kPa). It appeared that neither diene nor di- ethyl ether concentration affected the initial reaction rate, which depended only on the total chromium concentration. The system was completely inactive when this concentration was lower than about 25 mmol dm\"3. The study was carried out for diene/Cr ratios from 0.3 to 15 and total chromium concentrations from 0.005 to 0.15 mol dm\"3. Diethyl ether was present in some samples as an impurity from 1,5-CeHio synthesis. The re- action rate remained unchanged for some time (~1000 s) after the start, and then decreased slowly. After consumption of hydrogen stopped, a new por- tion of the diene could be added and the reaction then started again. The addition had to be done quickly, because when alkene was absent, the catalyst deactivated rapidly in the hydrogen atmosphere. When the reaction mixture was diluted with solvent (heptane), the reac- tion rate decreased slowly and after ~ 500 s achieved the level characteristic of the actual chromium concentration. Then it remained unchanged for some time and subsequently decreased as for other samples. Other experiments showed that the initial reaction rate was proportional to the partial hydrogen pressure.

The relationship between the initial reaction rate and the total chro- mium concentration (a straight line intersecting the abscissa) is not typical. Another type of a curve would be expected in the case of an equilibrium reaction between soluble forms of the catalytically active and inactive chro- mium compounds; either the curve would intersect the ordinate or would not be a straight line. The actual relationship could be explained assuming that the complex solution of constant concentration would remain in equi- librium with an active solid. It was most probably in colloidal dispersion, since no solid was observed in any of the experiments. This explanation was also confirmed by the fact that after dilution with the solvent the reaction rate decreased gradually, reaching the level characteristic of the actual chromium concentration, and that the catalytically active system was not clear. It was possible to separate a solid using a centrifuge, but neither the obtained solid nor the liquid was catalytically active. All attempts to isolate any active compound from the system failed. On hydrolysis, ~0.5 mol propene was produced per chromium. Spectros- copic studies (IR, UV) also gave no indications as to the structure of the active compound. The solid was introduced into a mass spectrometer. The spectrum showed no peaks that could be assigned to any chromium-contain- ing ions. After heating the sample, spectra of some organic substances ap- peared. The main product was CeHg, probably hexatriene or cyclohexadiene, as analysis of 70 eV and 15 eV spectra has revealed. CeHg could be formed by dimerization of two carbene ligands, which is often encountered in thermal decomposition of carbene complexes [10]. Further attempts to liberate a carbene ligand, by oxidation of the catalytically active compound or treatment with concentrated HC1 and with acetone, failed. None of the expected compounds (i.e. CH2=CHCH=0, CH^CHCH^Cl and (CH3)2C= CHCH=CH2, respectively [11]) was detected. Only after reaction with HC1 we were able to isolate 2-chloropropane (0.15 mol per Cr), the product of 310 hydrochlorination of propene which had already been found as a hydrolysis product. Other reactions gave no GLC-detectable products. The amount of hydrogen consumed before the rapid reaction with hydrogen started was equal to about 0.25 mol H2 per Cr, and was propor- tional to the total amount of chromium. No reasonable relationship between the active compound concentration (CQ; CQ ) and the amount of H; con- sumed could be found. References 1 E. N. Frankel and R. 0. Butterfield, J. Org.
