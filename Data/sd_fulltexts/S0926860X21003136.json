Graphical abstract The catalysts modified with hydrophobic organic groups can quickly remove water from the surface of the catalyst. Consequently, the oxidation of copper species and the growth of copper particles are inhibited, while the catalytic stability of methanol synthesis in the presence of water is improved. Improving the stability of Cu-based catalysts, especially in the presence of water, has always been a great challenge. The hydrophobization strategy and effects on the catalyst surface property and catalytic performance deserve rigorous investigations. Herein, the hydrophobic modified silica was introduced as a support for CuZn catalyst to hinder the adsorption of water on active sites of Cu-based catalysts, thereby improving its stability. And silane agents (methyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane) were selected to modify the SiO2 surface by a reaction between the silane agent and the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. After modification, the catalysts exhibited the better stability for methanol synthesis in the presence of water. FT-IR, BET, H2-TPR, XRD, TEM, XPS characterization were employed to determine the surface physical properties, reduction properties, crystal structure and particle size of the catalysts before and after the reaction. The results showed that water can simultaneously cause the oxidation and growth of Cu species resulting in the deactivation of Cu-based catalyst. However, the introduction of hydrophobic groups reduced the contact time between water and the active center, which prevented the growth and oxidation of Cu species, thus improving the catalyst stability. Keywords Methanol synthesis Modification Stability Particle growth Oxidation 1 Introduction Methanol is a very important chemical raw material, which could be converted into high value-added products through MTG, MTO, MTH reaction et al. [1–3]. Catalysts employed for methanol production are mainly divided into two categories, including Cu-based catalyst and precious metal catalyst [4,5]. It is noted that the Cu-based catalysts have been extensively studied in methanol synthesis because of their high activity and selectivity. Methanol has been industrially prepared from syngas derived from natural gas or coal, which mainly contains CO and H2 along with a small amount of CO2 [6]. In contrast to methanol synthesis from syngas, the formation of water vapor is inevitable when catalyzing syngas containing CO2 into methanol and hydrocarbons. At present, several studies have indicated that water has an influence on the physical structure, electronic properties and catalytic process of Cu-based catalysts. Deng et al. [7] found that water molecules easily adsorbed on Cu and Zn/Cu surface, then metallic Cu was prone to be partially oxidized into Cu2O, as evidenced by XPS results [8]. This would change the performance of Cu-based catalyst since the ratio of Cu°/Cu+ on the catalyst surface was directly related to the activity [9,10]. Wang et al. [11] utilized Cu-based methanol coupled with γ-Al2O3 catalyst for direct dimethyl ether production and the results revealed that part of the metallic Cu were converted into basic copper carbonate under the promotion of water, resulting in the catalyst deactivation. Besides the oxidation of Cu species induced by water as mentioned above, water can also easily accelerate the agglomeration of Cu particles during the reaction process [12], which would cause catalyst deactivation [13]. Wang et al. [14] studied the deactivation features of the composite catalyst and found that the sintering of Cu particles induced by water was the main reason for the severe catalyst deactivation. The unsatisfactory stability of Cu-based catalysts due to the presence of water is the key issue to be resolved for industrial application. Hence, offering efficient and widely applicable strategies to prepare a high-performance and long lived Cu-based catalyst have attracted much attention. Some approaches have been recently attempted including alloying [15,16], optimizing the metal-support interaction [9,17], encapsulation of individual nanoparticles in porous oxide shell [18] and maximizing the interparticle spacing [19]. Recently, our group had also made a lot of efforts to improve the stability of Cu-base catalyst. Chen et al. [20] developed a facile method to prepare a well dispersed CuZnO/SiO2 catalyst via rotary evaporation assisted deposition-precipitation method, and obtained a stable methanol selectivity and comparatively long-term stability during the reaction process. Later, Si et al. [21] studied the effect of CeO2 replacing Al2O3 in classical Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst on the existing form of Cu valence state in methanol synthesis process, and suggested that the doping of cerium additive into Cu-ZnO catalyst exhibited a remarkable positive effect on the catalyst stability, which resulted from the preservation of Cu°/Cu+ ratio on catalyst surface and the retarded oxidation to Cu2+ as well as the inhibition of particle growth due to the strong and complex electron interactions of the copper/ceria phase (Cu/Cu2O/CuO, Ce3+/Ce4+) during syngas hydrogenation. These methods impeded the deactivation of the catalyst to some extent by increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst or adjusting the distribution of Cu particles. However, the effect of water molecules on the catalyst surface was not effectively inhibited. Some studies have proved that the surface hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of catalysts play important roles in adjusting the activity and product selectivity [22]. The hydrophobic properties of Cu-based catalyst can improve the catalyst stability by inhibiting the proximity of water. In this work, the hydrophobic modified silica was introduced as a support for CuZnO catalyst to hinder the adsorption of water on active sites of Cu-based catalysts, thereby improving its stability. Specifically, Cu-based catalysts modified by different hydrophobic groups were prepared by simple co-precipitation method. With the help of characterization, the concrete effect of water on Cu-based catalyst was studied, and the important role of hydrophobic silica in catalyst was illustrated by the result of catalytic reaction evaluation. The results indicated that modified catalysts showed the promising stability for methanol synthesis from syngas containing CO2 even in the presence of water due to the inhibition of Cu particle growth and the further oxidation of Cu species. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Organic modification of SiO2 Modification of the silica was performed according to a procedure from de Jong et al. [23]. Hydrophobic organic groups were introduced on the silica surface via a reaction between the silane agent (methyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane) and the hydroxyl groups on the surface of silica. To avoid self-hydrolysis of the silane agent due to the presence of water, the modification was conducted under the inert nitrogen atmosphere. Firstly, 1.5 g silica (CAS: 112945-52-5) was dried overnight at 120 °C under vacuum. Then, 50 mL of toluene was added under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, x (x represents the volume of silane agent, x = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0) mL silane agent was added drop by drop and the suspension was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. After that, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rpm. The solvent was decanted and the silica was washed once with dry toluene and twice with ethanol using centrifugation. The obtained modified silica was dried overnight at 80 °C in air. The sample was denoted as SiO2-M(x) (M stands for methy, and x represents the volume of silane agent, x = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0), SiO2-E(1.5), SiO2-P(1.5) (E, P stands for ethyl, propyl, respectively, and 1.5 represents the volume of silane agent). 2.1.2 Preparation of catalyst The investigated catalysts were prepared by a conventional co-precipitation method. Typically, 8.81 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 5.84 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 56 mL deionized water to fabricate the solution of mixed metal salts (total cation concentration of 1 M). 10.6 g Na2CO3 was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water as the precipitant, simultaneously. The mixed metal salts solution and Na2CO3 precipitant were parallelly dropped to a beaker at 65 °C by two peristaltic pumps under vigorous stirring. Prior to the co-precipitation, 0.5 g modified SiO2 powers (fumed, 300 m2/g, from Aladdin) was added to the beaker. During the entire precipitation process, the pH value of the mixed slurry was controlled to be 7 by adjusting the titration rate of precipitant when the metal salt solution dropped at a constant rate. The resulting catalysts have the composition of CuZn/SiO2-M(x) (M stands for methy, and x represents the volume of silane agent, x = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0), CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5), CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) (E, P stands for ethyl, propyl, respectively, and 1.5 represents the volume of silane agent) with a Cu/Zn molar ratio of 65:35 and 10 wt% of silica. The product was aged at 65 °C for 1 h under stirring and then filtered and washed with deionized water. Finally, the filter cake was dried overnight at 100 °C and further calcined in air at 350 °C for 4 h. For comparison, the CuZn catalyst and CuZn/SiO2 catalyst were prepared by the co-precipitation method. See the supporting data for detailed steps. CuZn/SiO2-R mentioned in the following paper represents the catalyst modified by organic groups, and R represents methyl, ethyl and propyl groups. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The N2 physical adsorption-desorption isotherm was completed on the 3H-2000PS device. The surface area of the sample was determined by BET method, pore size was determined by t-plot method. FT-IR experiment was performed in Germany Bruker Tensor Ⅱ infrared spectrum. The sample was prepared by mixing KBr with the sample with a weight ratio of 100:1, which was used for the determination of functional groups in the sample. Contact angle measurement was done in Kruss DSA100 instrument. Before the measurement, the sample was pressed into thin slice. A drop of water (1 μL) was injected to the surface, and then water droplet morphology was recorded once every 0.1 s with a digital camera. Value of the contact angle was obtained by optical angle measuring method. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out in Micromeritics Aurochem 2920. 20 mg samples were first swept for 30 min under nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C. After cooling down to room temperature, the gas was switched to 10 % H2/Ar and the temperature was increased to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. In the process of measurement, the hydrogen consumption was detected by TCD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using GG314-JEM-2100 field emission transmission electron microscope. A certain amount of powder samples were ultrasonically dispersed in the ethanol solution for 40 min, and then several drops of suspended liquid were dropped on the carbon film of Cu net. The prepared sample was photographed under the condition of accelerating voltage of 200 KV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was tested on the German Bruker D4 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). The sweep range was 10−80 ° with a scanning rate of 8 °/min. The target voltage and the tube current were 40 KV and 100 mA, respectively. The grain size was calculated using Scherrer formula. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was performed on the ESCALAB250 energy spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source (acceleration voltage 1486.6 eV). The whole measurement was carried out under the high vacuum (10−8 torr). The C1s spectral line (284.6 eV) was used as the reference to correct the static charge accumulation. 2.3 Catalytic tests The catalyst activity was evaluated on a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel tube reactor (9 mm × 450 mm). 0.4 g of 20–40 mesh catalyst was loaded in the reactor with inert quartz sands above and under the catalyst. All catalysts were reduced in a flow of 10 vol% H2/N2 at 250 °C for 4 h, then the reduction gas was switched to the syngas (H2/CO/CO2/Ar = 64/24/8/4 (mol%), 30 mL/min) when the temperature naturally dropped below 100 °C. After flushing the pipe for 30 min, the pressure was slowly increased to 3 MPa with increasing the reaction temperature to 230 °C at the rate of 2 °C/min. In order to investigate the influence of H2O on the catalyst during the reaction process, the deionized water was added into the reaction gas with 0.6 mL/h or 1.5 % volume fraction by a microinjection pump and entered into the reactor together. All the products from the reactor were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). CO and CO2 were analyzed by a GC equipped with the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two columns of 5A molecular sieve column (4 mm × 200 mm) and the GDX-104 packed column. Methanol was analyzed by another GC equipped with the flame ionization detector (FID) and a column of Porapak-Q (27.5 mm × 0.32 mm ×10 μm). Argon was added in the reaction feed as an internal standard for analysis. 3 Results 3.1 Surface modification of SiO2 The silica powder was modified by hydrophobic organic groups according to a procedure from de Jong et al. [23]. Fig. 1 shows FT-IR spectra of silica before and after modification. In all cases, the absorption peaks at 1100 cm−1, 808 cm−1 and 468 cm−1 originated from stretching vibration of SiOSi bond and bending vibration of SiO bond, respectively [23,24]. Different from the unmodified silica, the hydrophobic group modified silica shows new absorption peaks at 2924 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1 due to the stretching vibration of the CH bond of the grafted methyl, ethyl and propyl groups on the silica surface, indicating that the hydrophobic group has been successfully grafted [23]. On the other hand, the absorption peaks appeared at near 3438 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 for all samples, which were attributed to the OH stretching vibration and HOH bending vibration of free and adsorbed water, respectively [25,26]. In addition, the peak at 960 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration peak of SiOH on the SiO2 surface, and the intensity of the methyl, ethyl, propyl modified silica at this peak was less than that of the unmodified silica, revealing the removal of surface terminal polar OH groups after silylation of SiO2 surface [25]. Furthermore, the texture properties of silica before and after modification are listed in Table 1 . Obviously, the specific surface of the modified silica was lower than that of the unmodified silica, suggesting that the methyl, ethyl and propyl groups may be successfully grafted on the silica surface, in consistent with the FT-IR findings. To further determine the hydrophobicity of modified silica, the water contact angle was measured. For the unmodified SiO2 (Fig. 2 a), the contact angle was 30 °. The water contact angle of SiO2-M(x) (x = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0) samples gradually increases and then becomes flat with the addition of hydrophobic groups, in which the maximum water contact angle of SiO2-M(1.5) samples was 50 ° (Fig. 2b and Fig. S1). This indicated that SiO2-M(1.5) samples exhibited the strongest surface hydrophobic property. For the modified silica by different hydrophobic groups (Fig. 2), with the increase of molecular chain length of different groups, the contact angle gradually increased, especially for the SiO2-P(1.5) as high as 66 °, indicating the enhanced hydrophobicity of SiO2 surfaces after modification. The change of contact angle depicted that grafting hydrophobic groups can indeed change the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of SiO2 surface. 3.2 Catalytic evaluation Firstly, the catalytic stability of CuZn/SiO2-M(x) (x = 0.5, 1.5, 5.0) catalysts for methanol synthesis from syngas is shown in Fig. S2A. All catalysts almost exhibited similar reaction activity during the initial 5 h. In order to reflect the influence of the modification on the water resistance of the catalyst more quickly, the catalyst performance was tested by adding water externally. Water with a rate of 0.6 mL/h was added into reactor at the fifth hour of the reaction. As a result, the catalyst under study presented different deactivation times after adding water. The modified CuZn/SiO2-M(x) catalysts exhibited better stability than that without modified (Fig. S2). The deactivation time of activity to 20 % was in the order of CuZn < CuZn/SiO2 < CuZn/SiO2-M(0.5) < CuZn/SiO2-M(5.0) < CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5). Obviously, CuZn catalyst showed relatively low activity compared with CuZn/SiO2 catalyst. This was probably due to the increased dispersion of active copper species supported on SiO2. Compared to the unmodified CuZn/SiO2 catalyst, the methyl modified catalysts exhibited a better stability because the addition of methyl groups enhances the hydrophobicity of the catalyst, thus delaying the deactivation of the catalyst. However, CuZn/SiO2-M(5.0) catalyst deactivated faster than CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5) catalyst, indicating that the catalyst hydrophobicity was not proportional to the amount of hydrophobic groups. This was probably because of the reduction of the exposed active site on the catalyst surface since the existence of excessive methyl groups. The results showed that the best hydrophobic effect was obtained when the modification amount was 1.5 mL. Although the deactivation time of the catalysts modified by different amounts of methyl groups differs somewhat after adding water, it can be seen from Fig. S2 that the difference was not significant, and the life extension of the catalysts was less than 1 h. The catalysts still deactivated rapidly with the addition of water. Therefore, it was necessary to seek groups with greater hydrophobic properties to modify the catalyst. Shi et al. [27] reported that organic groups of different chain lengths had different effects on the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis performance of Co-based catalysts. And the hydrophobic performance of the catalyst was further changed by increasing the chain length of the catalyst. Therefore, the effect of different chain length organic groups on the hydrophobic performance of the catalyst was further evaluated in detail. For most syngas conversion reactions mainly through CO hydrogenation, water is the primary oxygen-containing by-product [28,29]. In order to simulate the effect of the presence of by-product water on the Cu-based catalyst modified by different organic groups, 1.5 % volume fraction of water was added into the reactor at the fifth hour. As shown in Fig. 3 , the catalytic activity was similar before adding water. When water was added to the reaction gas, the activity of the catalyst began to decrease. For CuZn catalysts, the catalyst activity dropped by nearly 90 % under wet conditions, which implied that water possessed a great adverse effect on Cu-based catalysts. This trend was also observed by other researchers. Wu et al. [28] studied the stability of Cu-based catalysts in methanol synthesis and the results indicated that when the reaction gas contained a small amount of CO2, the activity of the catalyst decreased very slowly. However, when the methanol synthesis was conducted from CO2-rich feed, the deactivation rate of the catalyst got faster because a large amount of by-product water generated during the reaction causing rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Herein, when silica was added to the catalyst, the stability of the catalyst was somewhat improved, but the effect was not very significant. Obviously, compared to the unmodified CuZn/SiO2 catalyst, the modified catalysts exhibited a better stability. The stability was in the order of CuZn < CuZn/SiO2 < CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5) < CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5) < CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5). With increasing the hydrophobic group chain length, the water resistance of the catalyst was improved. Meanwhile, the chain length of organic group played an important role as physical barrier in space, which slowed down the migration and growth of the Cu particle, thus delaying the catalyst deactivation. XPS characterization was used to analyze the valence of Cu species on the used catalyst surface. Fig. 4 A is the XPS spectra of the Cu 2 P 3/2 of the used catalyst modified by different chain length groups. As can be seen, all the catalysts presented only one peak at 932.3 eV. It was generally accepted that it was difficult for Cu 2 P 3/2 to distinguish monovalent Cu from zero-valent Cu because the binding energy of the two species was almost the same, generally appearing at 932.6 eV. Divalent Cu was easily derived from monovalent Cu and the binding energy peak of divalent Cu generally appeared at around 934.1 eV [30–32]. Therefore, the observed 932.3 eV peak was attributed to Cu° or Cu+. Meantime, as noted from the XRD pattern, the diffraction peak of CuO was not significant (Fig. 5 A). However, after the reaction, H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 5B) showed a reduction peak, indicating that part of the Cu was indeed oxidized. Fig. 4B is the Cu LMM XAES spectra of the used catalyst modified by different chain length groups, manifesting the co-existing of Cu° and Cu+. The relatively surface contents of each Cu valence can be obtained by deconvolution of the spectra into two overlapping peaks at ∼914.2 and ∼916.8, corresponding to Cu+ and Cu°, respectively [33,34]. As shown in Fig. 4C, the obtained Cu+/(Cu° + Cu+) values were 49 % (CuZn), 40 % (CuZn/SiO2), 34 % (CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5)), and 29 % (CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5)), 22 % (CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5)), respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the zero-valent copper was mainly oxidized to monovalent copper during the reaction process. And the degree of oxidation decreased with the increase of hydrophobic group length. The rapid deactivation was observed due to the oxidation of Cu species because the active sites of the Cu-based catalyst in methanol synthesis were regarded as Cu° or Cu+ species [32,35]. This situation was also observed by other researchers. Chen et al. [8] prepared Cu/SiO2 catalysts by atomic deposition and studied the dissociation of water on Cu-based catalysts. The findings of H2-TPR and XANES indicated that some of the Cu was oxidized to monovalent Cu under the action of water. However, Cu2+ peaks appeared in the XPS spectra of the catalysts with different amounts of methyl modification (Fig. S3A), the peak at 934.3 eV was attributed to CuO, the results showed that the metallic Cu species were partially oxidized into CuO after reaction, this was due to the addition of a large amount of water to accelerate oxidation. The corresponding oxidation degree of Cu species was shown in Fig. S3B. It can be seen that the addition of hydrophobic groups can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Cu species, and the oxidation degree of the Cu species was the least when the modification amount was 1.5 mL. In addition, the catalyst with the modification amount of 1.5 mL had the longest deactivation time of activity to 20 % (Fig. S2), which indicated that the hydrophobic group can improve the catalyst stability by inhibiting the Cu oxidation. It was explained that the oxidation of Cu species was one of the main causes of catalyst deactivation in the presence of water. Furthermore, compared with the reduction temperature of the fresh catalyst (Fig. S4B and Fig. S4D), the reduction temperature of the used catalyst (Fig. S5B and Fig. 5B) greatly decreased, which indicated that the reduction temperature of the Cu species obtained by the surface oxidation was lower than that of the bulk Cu oxide. Here, given the same process from preservation to the characterization of the catalyst after the reaction, the changes of copper species on the catalyst surfaces caused by the external environment were ignored. In addition, with increasing of the molecular chain length of the groups, the reduction temperature of the used catalysts also gradually decreased, especially the CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalyst reduction temperature was only 127 °C, which could be explained by the fact that the hydrophobic properties of the propyl group could remove water from the Cu particles surface quickly, the oxidation degree of Cu particles was reduced. Upon increasing the length of the modified group chain, the hydrophobicity of the catalyst increased while the oxidation degree of Cu species decreased, as well as improving the catalyst stability, which further verified that the oxidation of Cu species was the reason for the catalyst deactivation in the presence of water. Some studies have shown that the metallic Cu species can be converted into carbonates under water conditions. Wang et al. [11] investigated the cause of the catalyst deactivation during the two methyl ether synthesis, showing that the alkaline copper carbonate, one of the reasons for the catalyst deactivation, appeared at 934.7 eV evidenced by XPS spectra. Deng et al. [7] also found the formation of basic carbonate when studying the chemical composition of the surface Cu in the presence of CO2 and H2O. In this paper, however, no peak at 934.7 eV was observed, which indicated that no metallic Cu species was converted into copper carbonate, so the formation of carbonate was not the main cause of the catalyst deactivation, as confirmed by XRD characterization. From Fig. S5A and Fig. 5A, there was no peak of carbonate between 20−30 ° characterize by XRD, suggesting that the conversion of metallic Cu to carbonate was not an inactivation factor. Later, XRD characterization was used to analyze the size of the crystallites in the catalyst modified with different chain length groups (methyl, ethyl, propyl), Fig. S4C and Fig. 5A is the XRD patterns of these catalysts before and after reaction. For the fresh samples in Fig. S4C, the diffraction peaks of CuO and ZnO were located at 2θ = 35.6 °, 38.9 °, 48.5 ° and 31.8 °, 34.4 °, 36.2 °, 56.5 °, 68.0 °, respectively [36,37]. According to the Scherrer formula, the grain size of CuO in the fresh catalyst is 11.8 nm (CuZn), 12.1 nm (CuZn/SiO2), 11.7 nm (CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5)), and 11.3 nm (CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5)), 11.1 nm (CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5)), respectively, which were almost in line with the mean size estimated by TEM (Fig. S6A). It can be seen that the grain size of CuO in the fresh catalysts was not much different, and the similarity in the grain size of Cu oxide also suggested that the size of the Cu metal obtained after the in-situ reduction of the catalysts will also be similar [23], consistent with the H2-TPR results before the reaction. From the Fig. S4D, the reduction temperature of the fresh catalysts was concentrated near 190 °C, which indicated that the size of the Cu oxide particles was almost the same. For the used catalysts, it can be seen from Fig. 5A that the diffraction peak of metal Cu at 43.4 ° gradually narrowed from the bottom to the top in half width, which implied that the grain size of metallic Cu gradually increased. The grain size of the metal Cu calculated by Scherrer formula was 14.0 nm (CuZn), 13.8 nm (CuZn/SiO2), 13.2 nm (CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5)), and 12.5 nm (CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5)), 11.8 nm (CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5)), respectively. Compared with the fresh catalysts, the growth extent of the Cu crystallite size of the used catalyst varied with the modification of different groups. The Cu particle size of the CuZn and CuZn/SiO2 catalysts increased greatly after reaction, indicating that Cu particles in the unmodified catalyst agglomerated more seriously under the induction of water, resulting in the rapid deactivation. However, the grain size of the different groups modified CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5), CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5), and CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalysts were relatively smaller compared to the unmodified catalysts, which might be due to the addition of hydrophobic groups reduced the contact time between water and catalyst, thus delaying the growth of Cu particles. And the CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalyst exhibited the smallest increase in Cu particle size, which proved that the hydrophobicity of the catalyst increased with the chain length. This was confirmed by TEM and BET characterization (Fig. 5C). Parameswaran [38] considered that large quantities of water led to the growth of Cu particles in the catalyst, thus reducing the specific surface area. As for the CuZn/SiO2-R(1.5) (R stands for methyl, ethyl, and propyl) catalysts, the reduce proportion of the specific surface area of the used catalyst became smaller in comparison with unmodified catalysts and the extent gradually reduced with the increase of molecular chain length. Especially for CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalysts, the size of the Cu particles after the reaction was only 13 nm, and the specific surface area decreased by only 17.8 %. This was due to the increase of molecular chains of modified groups and the increase of catalyst hydrophobicity, which prevented the growth of catalyst particles. On the other hand, the physical barrier effect of molecular chain length can also effectively reduce particle migration and agglomeration. H2-TPR characterization can also prove this point. From Fig. 5B, the CuZn catalyst showed the highest reduction temperature, and the reduction temperature decreased slightly after the addition of silica, because that the added silica increased the dispersion of Cu particles, thus slowing down the aggregation and growth of the Cu particles even in the addition of water. Compared with the unmodified catalyst, the reduction temperature of the used catalysts modified with different organic groups was less, indicating that the size of Cu particles on the modified catalysts surface was smaller than that of the unmodified catalysts. In addition, with the increase of the groups molecular chain length, the reduction temperature of the used catalysts also gradually decreased, especially the CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalyst reduction temperature was only 127 °C, which might be caused by the fact that the hydrophobic properties of the groups removed water from the Cu particles surface quickly. On the other hand, the molecular chain length of organic group played a role of physical barrier in space, slowing down the migration and growth of the Cu particles. 4 Discussion Water was easy to adsorb on the active site of the copper-based catalyst [39], resulting in the oxidation of copper species [8] and the aggregation of copper particles on the catalyst surface [13], resulting in the rapid deactivation of the copper-based catalyst, which posed a challenge to the further application of the copper-based catalyst. In our previous work, we have investigated the deactivation of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 in the presence of water [40]. The results showed that the deactivation of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was very fast after adding water. Herein, the effect of water on deactivation behavior of Cu-based catalysts was studied, and the reason of improving the catalyst stability by modifying hydrophobic groups was discussed. The results suggested that the modified Cu-based catalyst exhibited more resistant against deactivation than the unmodified one. Moreover, the deactivation of Cu-based catalyst was closely related to the oxidation of Cu species together with the growth of Cu species induced by water. 4.1 Retarding oxidation of Cu species From the H2-TPR results (Fig. 5B) after the reaction, it can be seen that all the catalysts possessed a certain reduction temperature, which indicated that part of the metallic Cu was oxidized in the condition of water. According to the XRD (Fig. 5A) and XPS (Fig. 4) characterizations, it was found that the diffraction peak of CuO was not significant, and thus it was confirmed that the metallic Cu was mainly oxidized to monovalent copper in the presence of water. And the Cu LMM XAES spectra of the used catalyst modified by different chain length groups in Fig. 4B manifested the co-existing of Cu0 and Cu+. The oxidation of Cu species changed the ratio of Cu0/Cu+ in the catalyst, thus affecting the catalyst activity [32,35]. The obtained Cu+/ (Cu0 + Cu+) value was shown in Fig. 4C, indicating that the degree of oxidation decreased with the increase of hydrophobic group length. Moreover, the reduction temperature of the unmodified catalyst was much higher than that of the hydrophobic catalyst, in the following order: CuZn ＞ CuZn/SiO2 ＞ CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5) ＞ CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5) ＞ CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5), which was consistent with the order of catalyst deactivation rates. It can also be seen in Fig. S3B, after a period of reaction, the oxidation degree of different catalysts was different. The oxidation degree of Cu species in the CuZn catalyst after reaction was as high as 78 %, and the activity of CuZn catalyst decreased rapidly after adding water (see Fig. S2). Consequently, the oxidation of the Cu species was possibly a reason for the deactivation in methanol synthesis. Moreover, with the modification of hydrophobic groups, the oxidation degree of Cu species decreased. After the reaction, the oxidation degree of Cu species in CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5) catalyst decreased to 65 %, and the activity of the catalyst decreased slowly after adding water, indicating that hydrophobic modification can effectively reduce the oxidation of Cu species, thus improving the catalyst stability. Fig. 6 showed the evolution of the oxidation of copper species in reaction. In a H2/N2 flow, the reduction of CuO to Cu was achieved for both catalysts. With the addition of reaction gas (H2/CO/CO2) and H2O, the hydrophobic groups in CuZn/SiO2-R (R stands for methyl, ethyl, and propyl) catalysts can quickly remove water, thus reducing the degree of oxidation of copper species by water molecules. However, the CuZn/SiO2 catalysts could not remove water in time, so the oxidation degree of copper species was greater. 4.2 Inhibiting the growth of Cu particles From the activity results in Fig. 3, the CuZn catalyst showed the largest activity decrease of almost 90 %. On the one hand, this was due to the oxidation of Cu species. On the other hand, the growth of Cu particles under the existence of water reduced the surface area of the active site [38], thus greatly reducing the stability of the catalyst, which can be confirmed by the above characterization results. In-depth characterization revealed the size of Cu particles in the catalysts was similar before the reaction (Figs. S4, S6 and S7), but the growth degree of Cu particles in the catalysts with different hydrophobic groups was different after the reaction. From the XRD results (Fig. 5A), it can be seen that the grain size of the Cu particles of the used CuZn catalyst was the largest. From the TEM image (Fig. S6B), the average size of the Cu particles after the reaction was 33 nm, indicating that the CuZn catalyst agglomerates seriously in the reaction process. The Cu particles in CuZn catalyst increased by 175 % (Fig. 5C), from 12 nm to 33 nm. Moreover, the CuZn catalyst exhibited a maximum reduction in specific surface area, also implying the the migration and agglomeration of the Cu particles. In the contrast, the CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) catalyst only increased by 8.3 %, from 12 nm to 13 nm. This indicated that the addition of hydrophobic groups could feasibly delay the growth of Cu particles in spite of the existence of water. The distance between the two adjacent groups became larger, reducing the chance that the Cu particles migrate from one group to the other. At the same time, the molecular chain of the group acted as a physical barrier in space, which can also slow down the migration and growth of Cu particles. Therefore, grafting hydrophobic organic group can endow hydrophobic ability and physical barrier effect of Cu-based catalyst to improve its stability in water-enriched environment. Fig. 7 showed comparison of copper particle size evolution in reaction. XRD patterns (Fig. S4) showed that the CuO particles in fresh catalysts were similar in size, so the copper particles in different catalysts were similar in size after reduction in H2/N2 flow [23]. After adding water to the reaction, the particle growth of CuZn/SiO2-R (R stands for methyl, ethyl, and propyl) catalysts was not obvious, because the introduction of hydrophobic groups can reduce the adsorption of water molecules to the active center, thus delaying the growth of copper particles. In contrast, water molecules were easy to adsorb on the active center of the CuZn/SiO2 catalysts, so the copper particles grow up seriously. 4.3 Reducing the influence of water on the active site of catalyst The active sites of CuZn catalysts are very complex. Generally, the active sites for the Cu–ZnO based catalysts can be grouped into the following categories: a) Cu species (metallic or oxidized Cu species); b) Cu–ZnO interface [41,42]; c) defective Cu surface; d) Cu–Zn alloy [43,44]; and e) ZnO decorated Cu. All these have led to the conclusion that the Cu species and/or Cu–Zn contact is necessary for the activity of the Cu/ZnO-based catalysts [45]. The state of Cu species has a great influence on the activity of the catalyst, while Cu state is more sensitive to the presence of water [7]. In this paper, the causes of water-induced deactivation of copper-based catalyst were studied from the view of the change of microenvironment of copper species when adding water. The results showed that water gives rise to the oxidation of Cu species and the growth of Cu particles, resulting to the deactivation of the Cu-based catalyst. However, the change of copper species may affect the interaction between Cu and ZnO, thus affecting the activity of the catalyst. It can be seen from Fig. 5A and Fig. S5A that the size of ZnO particles in catalysts after reaction was not different. After adding water to the reaction, the growth degree of Cu particles and the oxidation degree of Cu species were different with different catalysts. It was more obvious in the catalyst without hydrophobic modification. Therefore, with the growth of Cu particles and oxidation of the Cu species, the interaction between CuZn weakens, leading to the degradation of catalyst performance (see Figs. 6 and 7). 5 Conclusion This work investigated the influence of hydrophobic group modification on the stability of Cu-based catalyst in methanol synthesis from syngas. The investigated catalysts were prepared by a simple co-precipitation method and characterized by FT-IR, XPS, XRD, TEM and H2-TPR. The results showed that the presence of water could induce the oxidation and growth of Cu species. The modified catalysts with hydrophobic organic groups can quickly remove water from the surface of the catalyst, thus inhibiting the oxidation of Cu species and the growth of Cu particles, reducing the influence of water on Cu-ZnO interaction, and eventually improving the catalytic stability of methanol synthesis even in the presence of water. With the molecular chain length increasing, the stability of the catalyst gradually increased, following the order: CuZn/SiO2-P(1.5) > CuZn/SiO2-E(1.5) > CuZn/SiO2-M(1.5), which can be attributed to the hydrophobic function of the organic groups and the physical barrier of the long chain molecules. This preliminary study provides reference to rationally design and optimize the required catalyst and experimental conditions for improving the stability of Cu-based catalyst and water involved reaction.

        "dc:description": "Improving the stability of Cu-based catalysts, especially in the presence of water, has always been a great challenge. The hydrophobization strategy and effects on the catalyst surface property and catalytic performance deserve rigorous investigations. Herein, the hydrophobic modified silica was introduced as a support for CuZn catalyst to hinder the adsorption of water on active sites of Cu-based catalysts, thereby improving its stability. And silane agents (methyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane) were selected to modify the SiO2 surface by a reaction between the silane agent and the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. After modification, the catalysts exhibited the better stability for methanol synthesis in the presence of water. FT-IR, BET, H2-TPR, XRD, TEM, XPS characterization were employed to determine the surface physical properties, reduction properties, crystal structure and particle size of the catalysts before and after the reaction. The results showed that water can simultaneously cause the oxidation and growth of Cu species resulting in the deactivation of Cu-based catalyst. However, the introduction of hydrophobic groups reduced the contact time between water and the active center, which prevented the growth and oxidation of Cu species, thus improving the catalyst stability.",
