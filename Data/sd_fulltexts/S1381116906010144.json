Fax: +86 579 2282595. Graphical abstract At low Pd loading (0.1wt.% and 0.5wt.%), only highly dispersed PdO exists, and it grows to crystalline structure as Pd loading increases up to 2wt.%. Both the highly dispersed PdO and the crystalline structure PdO are active sites for CO oxidation, while the crystalline structure PdO is active site for CH4 oxidation. The Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution was prepared by nitrate sol–gel method, and a series of catalysts with different PdO loading were prepared using impregnation method. These catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, CO-TPR, CO2- and O2-TPD techniques. The PdO is highly dispersed on the surface of the solid solution when the loading is lower than 0.5wt.%. As PdO loading increases to 2wt.%, it begins to form the crystalline structure. CO2-TPD profiles show that the CO adsorbed on highly dispersed PdO is more easily oxidized to CO2 than that adsorbed on crystalline structure and O2-TPD results indicate that it is more difficult to decompose for highly dispersed PdO than that for crystalline structure. CO-TPR profiles show that the highly dispersed PdO is easily reduced. Catalytic activities of these catalysts for CO and CH4 oxidation indicate that both the highly dispersed and crystalline PdO are the active site for CO oxidation, while the crystalline structure is the active site for CH4 oxidation. Keywords Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution PdO CO oxidation CH4 oxidation 1 Introduction Ceria has been the subject of intense studies in recent years because of its broad applications in various fields, such as catalyst, polishing material and solid fuel cell [1–4]. In the field of catalysis, cerium oxide has been used as a promoter in three-way catalysts for removing exhaust gas due to its enhanced oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [5]. Also, it has been reported that CeO2 and rare earth oxide can significantly promote the dispersion of noble metal or increase the thermal stability, thus favor catalytic activity [6,7], among which its foremost role is to act as an oxygen storage component [5,8]. The high OSC of CeO2 is associated with its rich oxygen vacancies and easy shift between CeO2 and Ce2O3 under corresponding conditions [9–11]. The capabilities of redox and thermal stability of cerium oxide under high temperature are strongly enhanced by introducing other elements into the CeO2 lattice to form solid solution [12–14]. More recently, it was reported that the introduction of ZrO2 in ceria lattice leads to remarkable improvement in thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity [15–18]. With higher OSC, higher conversion efficiency and resistance to thermal aging are generally observed on the catalyst. The catalytic oxidation at low temperature is an efficient way to convert CO to CO2. The most efficient catalysts are noble metals, such as Au [19–25], Pt [26] and Pd [25,27], and their catalytic behaviors have been extensively investigated. Methane is the main component of natural gas, and its structure is very different from that of CO. Moreover, methane is a hydrocarbon that is very difficult to be catalytically oxidized [28]. The catalytic oxidation of CH4 has been studied as an alternative for environmental friendly combustion of gas fuels and this approach has no emission of deleterious gas [29]. It is well known that some noble metal catalysts such as Pt [30,31] and Pd [32–36] are most active for complete oxidation of the hydrocarbons. In our previous work, a series of PdO/Ce x Y1−x O1.5+0.5x catalysts with different x have been studied and it was found that the PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalyst was the most active catalyst for the oxidation of methane [37]. With regard to the support, in this paper, the relationship between structure and activity of the PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalyst were further studied in order to confirm the active sites for CO and methane oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 mixed oxides was prepared by citrate sol–gel method which was described in our previous work [37]. The supported PdO catalysts were prepared by a conventional impregnation method using an aqueous solution of H2PdCl4 with a concentration of 8.85gL−1 (in Pd). The samples were dried at 120°C over night, and then calcined at 600°C in air for 4h with a heating rate of 20°C min−1. The catalysts are denoted as PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9, and the loading of Pd was 0.1, 0.5 and 2wt.%, respectively. 2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Philips PW3040/60 automated powder diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1542nm). The intensity data were collected at room temperature over a 2θ range of 20–75° with a step interval of 0.02°. Raman spectra measurements were performed on a Renishaw RM 1000 with a confocal microprobe Raman system with an excitation wavelength of 632.8nm. With the aim of characterizing the desorption characteristics of these catalysts, the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 and O2 were performed on a home-made instrument. For CO2-TPD measurement, a 100mg of sample was located in a quartz micro-reactor and pre-treated in He (30mlmin−1) at 500°C for 0.5h, then it was cooled down to room temperature. Then 10 consecutive pulses of 1ml of CO were injected until the adsorption of CO was saturated. The samples were purged with He at the same temperature for 1h to remove the physically adsorbed CO. Finally, the desorption step was conducted in flowing He from room temperature to 950°C with a constant rate of 20°C min−1. The procedure of temperature-programmed desorption of O2 was similar to that of CO2-TPD, except that the sample was pretreated in O2 with a flow rate of 30mlmin−1. The signals of CO2 and O2 were analyzed using a Balzers Omnistar 200 mass spectrometer by monitoring m/e =44 (for CO2) and 32 (for O2). The reduction properties of the PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts were measured by CO-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction). About 50mg of the catalyst was placed in a quartz tube without pretreatment, and then a reduction gas of 5% CO in Ar (30mlmin−1) was introduced. The reaction temperature rose from room temperature to 910°C with a constant rate of 20°C min−1. The amount of CO consumption and the signal of CO2 were monitored by a Balzers Omnistar 200 mass spectrometer at m/e =44. The Pd dispersion of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts was calculated from CO chemisorption uptakes measured by pulse chemisorption with a mass spectrometry (Omnistar TM) at 25°C. The catalysts reduced by hydrogen were treated in a quartz microreactor with a H2 stream of 8mlmin−1. The temperature rose from 25 to 250°C with a constant rate of 5°C min−1 and maintained for 0.5h, followed by a He purge of 30mlmin−1 for 2h at 25°C. 2.3 Activity measurement for carbon monoxide and methane oxidation The catalytic activity measurement was carried out in a fixed bed reactor. The catalysts were pressed to pellets, then crushed and sieved to 20–40 mesh. A 500mg of catalyst was used for reaction. In both reactions, the total gas flow rate was 80mlmin−1 and the reaction was stabilized for 1h. In CO oxidation, the composition of inlet gas mixture was 3% CO, 3% O2 in N2. The inlet and outlet gas mixture was analyzed on a Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector attached with a HP PLOT column (30m×0.32mm×12.0μm). In methane oxidation, the inlet gas was 3% methane, 8% O2 and 89% N2. CH4 was analyzed on a Shimadzu GC-14C gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector attached with a supelcowax-10 column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts with different Pd loadings calcined at 600°C for 4h. From this figure, only cubic CeO2 was observed. The lattice parameter of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts is 0.5401nm, which is smaller than that of pure CeO2 (0.5410nm) [38,39]. This is because the radius of Y3+ (0.092nm) is smaller than that of Ce4+ (0.097nm), which leads to the shrink of CeO2 lattice when Ce4+ was partially substituted with Y3+. This indicates that the Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution is formed in these catalysts. No characteristic diffraction peaks due to PdO (or Pd) was found for all the samples, which is probably due to the PdO (or Pd) is low or the PdO (or Pd) species that are highly dispersed on the surface of the Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution. Fig. 2 shows the laser Raman spectra of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts calcined at 600°C for 4h. The Raman band observed at 467cm−1 is attributed to the Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution [37] and the characteristic peak of Y2O3 at 372cm−1 was not observed [40,41]. This further proves the formation of Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution, which is consistent with the XRD results. The bands at 558 and 614cm−1 are likely to be due to the formation of oxygen vacancies [42], which is also the evidence for the formation of solid solution. Furthermore, when the Pd loading is lower than 0.5wt.%, only Raman bands due to the solid solution were observed. As the Pd loading increases to 2%, a weak band at about 652cm−1 was observed, which was ascribed to PdO [43]. The Raman signal of PdO (0.5%)/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalyst was magnified as shown in the inset, however, the peak at 652cm−1 ascribed to PdO was not observed, either. This indicates that the PdO species were highly dispersed at low loading. As the Pd loading increases up to 2%, the particles grow up to form crystalline PdO. 3.2 The CO2-TPD and O2-TPD characterizations of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts The CO2-TPD profiles of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 with different Pd loadings are shown in Fig. 3 . It was found that no peaks due to CO desorption were observed (the figure is not shown in this paper). Only one CO2 desorption peak at about 110°C (α) was observed when Pd loading is low (0.1 and 0.5wt.%). While at high loading (2wt.%), a new CO2 desorption peak at 195°C (β) appears. From Raman results it could be seen that with low loading only highly dispersed PdO is existed on the surface of the solid solution, and it grows to crystalline structure as the loading increases. So the α and β peaks are likely to be ascribed to the highly dispersed PdO and the crystalline structure, respectively. This indicates that the CO adsorbed on highly dispersed PdO is easier to be oxidized to CO2 than that adsorbed on crystalline structure. Fig. 4 shows the O2-TPD profiles of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts with different Pd loadings. In the range of 40–900°C, no O2 desorption peak was observed when the loading is 0.1wt.%. While for the catalyst of 0.5% Pd loading, a peak with moderate intensity appears. As Pd loading increases to 2%, the intensity of O2 desorption peak is augmented, furthermore, the temperature of O2 desorption decreases remarkedly. The desorption peak was attributed to the decomposition of PdO. This indicates that it is much more difficult to decompose for highly dispersed PdO than that for crystalline structure PdO, probably due to the strong interaction between highly dispersed PdO and the Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution. 3.3 The CO-TPR characterization of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts The CO-TPR profiles of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts with different Pd loadings are shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5, it can be seen that for the solid solution, no CO2 signal was observed at low temperature (<400°C), but two peaks appear at higher temperature region: a strong peak (θ) and a weak peak (γ). For the catalysts of 0.1 and 0.5wt.% Pd, another peak at 105°C (α) was observed besides the γ and θ peaks. The TPR profile of 2% Pd loading exhibits four peaks at 100°C (α), 235°C (β), 381°C (γ), 682°C (θ), respectively. It could be seen that the γ and θ peaks were present for all the catalysts, and the γ peak strongly shifted to lower temperature and its intensity strengthened as the PdO loading increased, while the intensity of θ peak declined with the increasing Pd loading. Therefore, it could be concluded that the γ peak is the reduction of surface oxygen on the solid solution and the θ peak is the reduction of bulk oxygen [44] and the reduction of surface sites is highly enhanced as PdO loading increases. Furthermore, the number of γ oxygen species increase and it get more active when the presence of PdO on the surface of solid solution. The α peak can be seen for all the cataysts, while the β peak could be observed only for the 2wt.% Pd loading catalyst. Combined with the Raman results, it is reasonable to conclude that the α peak is ascribed to the reduction of highly dispersed PdO and the β peak is due to the reduction of crystalline PdO. 3.4 Catalytic activity for CO and CH4 oxidation Fig. 6 shows the catalytic activity of PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 for CO oxidation with various Pd loadings. None of these catalysts was pretreated before the reaction .The reaction was kept at each temperature for about 1h to achieve steady activity. The T 90 (the temperature when the conversion is 90%) for PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts with 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2wt.% Pd loadings are 300, 200, 160 and 140°C, respectively. It can be seen that the presence of a small amount of Pd can significantly enhance the catalytic activity. Fig. 7 shows that the catalytic activities for CH4 oxidation with PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the T 90 for PdO/Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 catalysts with 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2wt.% Pd loadings are 580, 580, 580 and 500°C, respectively. It implies that with low Pd loading (0.1 and 0.5wt.%), the contribution of Pd species to the activity was limited. When the loading increases to 2wt.%, the activity was enhanced. In order to clarify the active site for CO and CH4 oxidation, turnover frequency (TOF) [26] for CO and CH4 oxidation over the catalysts were calculated based on Pd dispersion results and are listed in Table 1 . The dispersion of PdO for 0.1, 0.5, 2wt.% catalysts are 97.8%, 27.0% and 7.7%, respectively. The TOFs were calculated by subtracting the activity of the support, so the TOFs indicate the intrinsic activity of the PdO species. Since the support was inactive for CO oxidation at 140°C (Fig. 6), while for CH4 oxidation at 460°C, the catalysts with 0.1 and 0.5wt.% Pd loading had same activities as the support (Fig. 7). Note that the activity of 0.1wt.% Pd loading catalyst was slightly lower than support for CH4 oxidation, probably due to experimental error. From Table 1, it can be seen that for CO oxidation, the intrinsic activity was enhanced with increasing Pd loading. For CH4 oxidation, the catalysts with 0.1 and 0.5wt.% Pd loading have no contribution to the activity; while with 2wt.% Pd loading the activity was improved. The difference between the TOFs for CO and CH4 oxidation clearly shows that the different active sites for the two reactions. For CO oxidation, both highly dispersed PdO species and crystalline PdO are active sites. For CH4 oxidation, only crystalline PdO was responsible for the activity. However, it should be noticed that the highly dispersed PdO species could be easily reduced, as shown in CO-TPR results (Fig. 5), so during the reaction, the PdO sites could be partially reduced by CO and these reduced sites can activate both CO and O2 reactants. Therefore, a mixed PdO x phase could be present during CO oxidation. In contrast, the oxidic PdO could hardly be reduced by CH4 even at high temperature, so it is more likely that the oxidic PdO species are the active sites for CH4 oxidation. 4 Conclusions PdO is highly dispersed on the surface of the Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 solid solution when the loading is low (≤0.5wt.%), and it begins to form the large crystalline structure when the Pd loading increases to 2wt.%. CO-TPR results reveal that highly dispersed PdO species are present on low Pd loading catalysts (0.1 and 0.5wt.%), while on the high Pd loading catalyst (2wt.%) there is a mixture of highly dispersed PdO and crystalline PdO. By comparing the turnover frequency of CO and CH4 oxidation, it could be concluded that both the highly dispersed PdO and the crystalline structure PdO are the active sites for the reaction of CO oxidation, while the crystalline structure PdO is the active site for CH4 oxidation.
