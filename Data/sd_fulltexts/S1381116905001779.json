Keywords Ionic liquid Fischer esterification Acids Alcohol and reaction medium 1 Introduction Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have attracted great research interest due to the potential commercial and environmental advantages they offer over existing liquids. RTILs are comprised of ions that allow them to potentially behave in a very different manner to conventional molecular liquids when they are used as solvents [1–3]. Esterification of alcohols by carboxylic acids is an important reaction in both laboratory work and in organic industry [4]. Esters ranging from aliphatic to aromatic are generally used as plasticizers, solvents, perfumes, and flavor chemicals and also as precursors for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and fine chemicals [5]. Esterification is conventionally carried out by using homogeneous catalysts such as sulfuric acid and p-toluene sulphonic acid [6,7] suffer from the problem of side reactions, corrosion of the equipment and require tedious isolation of products and removal of large volumes of salt waste during neutralization of homogeneous acid. The extensive demand for cleaner environment is forcing chemical industry to use less hazardous materials. To overcome these disadvantages efforts have been made to the development of heterogeneous catalysts systems. Esterification has been carried out previously using different heterogeneous acid catalysts such as resins [8,9], supported mineral acid [10] heteropoly acids [11,12], and zeolites [13] by different groups. However these catalysts due to their corrosive nature, high cost and unstable nature could not be used in production centers. Another approach to environment friendly reactions is to minimize the use of volatile organic solvents (VOC's) in reactions and their subsequent workup. Ionic liquids are emerging as a green reaction media (catalyst+solvent). The use of ionic liquids as reaction medium may offer a convenient solution to both the solvent emission and catalytic recycling problem [1,14–16]. Currently reports are available in the open literature on esterification of alcohols and olefins using ionic liquids [17–20]. Esterification of benzyl alcohol with acetic acid using H-β and H-Y gave selectivity for ester in the range of 75–100% [21]. In this work we have used Brönsted acidic ionic liquid with different inorganic anions of the type BF4 −, PF6 − and PTSA− and used for the esterification of benzyl alcohol with acetic acid. The role of the ionic liquid will be to provide a medium for the catalyst and solubility for starting materials and products. Such combination of catalyst with medium has been found to be a viable alternative approach towards modern synthetic chemistry especially when considering the growing environmental demands being placed on chemical processes. The advantage of using RTIL for esterification is the ease with the ester can be separated out from the reaction medium by simple decantation as they are insoluble in most of the RTILs and there is no need to remove the water formed in the reaction as it remains in the RTIL. The RTIL can be reused after removing the water. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All the acids and alcohols were obtained from S.D. Fine Chemicals, Ltd. (Mumbai) India and were used as received. Tetrafluoroboric acid (40%) solution in water was obtained from Loba Chemie India. 1-Methylimidazole (99%), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (99%), Potassium hexafluorophosphate (98%) and Sodium tetrafluoroborate (98%) were obtained from Lancaster (UK). 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of 1-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([MIM]+BF4 −) Tetrafluoroboric acid (8.06g, 0.03mol, 40% solution in water) was slowly added to a precooled solution (0°C) of 1-methylimidazole (3g, 0.03mol) placed in a two-necked flask with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was maintained at that temperature and stirred for 2h. The resulting colorless Ionic Liquid was dried in a rotavapor for 2h. at 60°C to remove water and used for esterification. 2.2.2 Preparation of 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]+BF4 −) and 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]+PF6 −) 1-Butyl 3-methylimidazolium chloride (1.74g, 0.01mol) was dissolved in 50ml of acetone in a 100ml round bottom flask provided with a stirrer. Then NaBF4 (1.09g, 0.01mol) or KPF6 (1.84g, 0.01mol) was added and the solution was stirred for 24h. at room temperature (Fig. 1 ). The resulting precipitate of NaCl or KCl was filtered and acetone was removed on a rotavapor to obtain a yellow colored liquid. 2.2.3 Preparation of 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium para-toluenesulfonicacid ([BMIM]+PTSA−) 1-Butyl 3-methylimidazolium chloride (1.74g, 0.01mol) was placed in a two necked flask with stirrer and was cooled to 0°C. Then 5ml of water was added to it and para-toluenesulfonic acid (1.90g, 0.01mol) was added slowly under stirring. The mixture was stirred for 2h. and the water was removed on a rotavapor at 60°C to obtain a green colored liquid. 2.3 Characterization procedures The FTIR spectra of the ionic liquids were recorded on a Shimadzu (model 8201 PC) spectrophotometer using KBr plates in a frequency range 1750–1300cm−1 using pyridine as a probe for acidity measurement. The 1H NMR spectrum of the ionic liquids were recorded immediately after dissolution of the complex in CDCl3 with TMS as reference (200MHz). 2.4 Catalytic activity studies The utility of the ionic liquids was established in the esterification of aliphatic acids with alcohols. In a typical reaction benzyl alcohol (1.05g), acetic acid (1.2g) and 1g of ionic liquid were taken in a 50ml two-necked round bottom flask immersed in an oil bath and fitted with a water cooled condenser. The reactions were conducted at 110°C. The progress of the reactions was monitored by withdrawing the samples at different times and analyzing them by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 14B; FID detector; SE-52 capillary column). The identities of the products were confirmed by GC–MS (Shimadzu GC–MS QP 5000). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 FTIR The Lewis and Brönsted acidity of the ionic liquid has been determined using pyridine as a probe molecule by monitoring the bands in the range of 1350–1600cm−1 arising from its ring vibration modes [22,23]. The FTIR spectra of neat pyridine show a band at 1425cm−1 (Fig. 2 a). On mixing pyridine with ionic liquid, the spectrum of ionic liquid shows a band near 1450cm−1 indicates the coordination of pyridine to the Lewis acid sites, with an additional band near 1540cm−1 indicating the presence of Brönsted acid sites due to the formation of pyridinium ions (Fig. 2b–e). 3.1.2 1H NMR The 1H NMR (200MHz, CDCl3, TMS) spectrum of the ionic liquid [BMIM]+BF4 − shows that the protons resonate in the range δ 0.88(s, 3H), 1.533(m, 2H), 1.839(m, 2H), 3.9(s, 3H), 4.062(m, 2H), 7.22(m, 2H), 9.40(s, 1H). The 1H NMR (200MHz, CDCl3, TMS) spectrum of the ionic liquid [MIM]+BF4 − shows that the protons resonate in the range δ 1.18(s, 3H), 7.1(m, 2H), 9.4(s, 1H). From the 1H spectral data, it is revealed that the proton (δ 9.4), which is in between the two nitrogens in the imidazole ring, might be acidic. 3.2 Esterification Fischer esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol was carried out with different ionic liquids (Table 1 ). All the ionic liquids gave very good conversions and excellent product selectivity. The results on varying the anion of the ionic liquid are presented in Table 1 esterification proceeded smoothly to completion. A maximum 100% conversion and 100% product selectivity was observed on using [BMIM]+PTSA− as catalyst over a period of 2h. [BMIM]+PF6 − also gave 100% conversion in 2h but only 90% selectivity for ester was observed and the remaining 10% ether was formed (Table 1, Entry 3). The effect of mole ratio of imidazole and BF4 − on the esterification of benzyl alcohol with acetic acid was studied (Table 1, Entry 1–2). It is seen that on increasing the amount of anion in the ionic liquid, the conversion increases but the selectivity remains the same. The results in Table 2 show the esterification of different alcohols with acetic acid and propionic acid using [MIM]+BF4 − (MIM/BF4 −, 1:0.4) as catalyst and solvent. Conversion in the range 70–80% and 100% selectivity was observed for all the reactions over a period of 4h. For complete conversion, the reaction had to be carried out for longer time. Further increase in conversion was also observed on increasing the temperature to 120°C. Most of the esters were immiscible with ionic liquid, so it could be separated by decantation as it forms a separate layer at the end of the reaction. The esters that were miscible with the ionic liquid had to be separated by extraction with ether. All the ionic liquids were easily recyclable after removing water. [MIM]+BF4 − was recycled 4 times for the esterification of benzyl alcohol with acetic acid (Table 3 ). Minor loss in activity was observed after 4 recycles. Selectivity remained same for all the recycles. 4 Conclusions Esterification using catalytic amount of ionic liquids gave high substrate conversion and product selectivity. Esterification with ionic liquid as reaction medium proceeded smoothly to completion and liquid esters were conveniently decanted out from the ionic liquid. Use of such a reaction medium should be appreciated for its easy preparation, convenient separation, recycle of the catalyst, low cost and eco-friendly nature.
