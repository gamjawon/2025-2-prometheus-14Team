Introduction Metalâ€�free catalysts are newly emerging green catalytic materials that have attracted much attention in recent years for their advantanges of high efficiency, environment friendliness and economy in many industrial catalytic processes. There are a variety of organic metalâ€�free catalysts, such as small organic molecules containing N, P electronâ€�rich center, dendrimers, ionic liquids, etc., which have been widely used in various homogeneous organic reactions for rearrangement reactions, cycloaddition, condensation, alkylation and carbonylation [1â€’3]. An important type of inorganic metalâ€�free catalysts develâ€� oped in recent years are nanocarbon materials that have demonstrated superior catalytic performance to traditional metal catalysts in many fields, including hydrocarbon converâ€� sion, fine chemicals production, fuel cells, and solar energy [4,5]. Metalâ€�free carbonâ€�based catalysis has become one of the most promising research directions in nanomaterials and caâ€� talysis. The carbon material itself is used as the catalyst and no metal is loaded or added, so the active sites for the reaction are the defective structure or functional groups on the carbon surâ€� face. Compared with a metalâ€�based catalyst, a nanocarbon catâ€� alyst has the advantages of low cost, no heavy metal pollution and environmental friendliness, while showing high selectivity and long term stability under mild conditions in many catalytic processes. This review focuses on the key issues of their cataâ€� lytic properties in heterogeneous catalytic system, the reaction mechanism and macroscopic architecture of metalâ€�free carâ€� bonâ€�based catalysts. 2. Structure and surface chemistry of nanocarbon materials Many carbon materials used in catalysis have the graphitic structure. These marterials include conventional activated carbon, carbon black and graphite, and also the new nanomaterials of fullerenes, nanotubes and nanofibers, * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 3, March 2013 SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 graphene and mesoporous carbon. Nanocarbon materials are prepared by severe chemical processes such as laser arc discharge, ablation and chemical vapor deposition, and thus a large amount of structural defects are introduced into the carbon surface. The terminating surâ€� face of a curved graphitic structure requires new foreign atoms to saturate the dangling bonds at the defects and edges. After chemical postâ€�treatment, these sites can be modified with hetâ€� eroatoms to provide strong chemical reactivity for acidâ€�base and redox chemistry. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are the most frequently incorporated atoms. Figure 1 summarizes the difâ€� ferent oxygen and nitrogen functional groups found on carbon surfaces [4]. Oxygenated functional groups have been the most extensively studied because they are formed spontaneously by the exposure of the carbon material to the atmosphere. Acidic oxygen groups include carboxylic acids, anhydrides, lactones and phenols. Carbonyls and ether oxygen species, such as quiâ€� nones, pyrones, and benzopyrans are generally alkaline or neutral oxygen functional groups. 3. Catalytic performance of nanocarbon materials The excellent catalytic performance of nanocarbon materiâ€� als is due to their unique properties. First, most nanocarbons with a nanographite structure possess good electrical conducâ€� tivity and ability to store/release electrons, which facilitates the rate of electron transfer in the critical step of the catalytic reacâ€� tion and increases the overall reaction rate. Second, nanocarâ€� bon materials have very high specific surface areas and mesoâ€� pore volumes, and have more surface active sites than convenâ€� tional materials, thus improving the catalytic performance by the faster diffusion of reactant molecules in the mesopores. Finally, the higher concentration of surface defects on the nanocarbon materials can be functionalized with more oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms. Table 1 lists some common reacâ€� tions that are catalyzed by nanocarbon materials and the reâ€� quired surface functional groups or active sites [5]. 3.1. Gas phase reactions In the past few years, most studies of gas phase reactions catalyzed by nanocarbons were focused on the oxidative dehyâ€� drogenation system. In 2001, Robert SchlÃ¶glâ€™s research group carried out the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenâ€� zene using carbon nanofibers as the catalyst [6,7] and found that the carbon nanofibers showed a higher catalytic activity than highly dispersed graphite at the reaction temperature of 547 oC, and also had a far superior stability to traditional amorphous carbon black. A series of studies subsequently demonstrated that many nanostructured carbons can efficientâ€� ly catalyze the ODH reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene (Fig. 2), and that these catalysts exhibited comparable or even better activities than the traditional iron oxide catalysts [8â€’13]. This is because the defects of the carbon surface can anchor functional groups as the active sites, while the graphitic structure can tightly hold the active sites to give excellent thermal stability even under an oxidative atmosphere [14]. In 2008, Su et al. [15] ï¬�rst reported that the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to butene and butadiene can be catalyzed by carbon nanotubes. When the carbon nanotubes were additionally modified by passivation of the defects with phosphorus oxide, the resulting CNTs gave improved catalytic activity, while the reaction temâ€� perature was further decreased by 100â€’200 oC below the inâ€� dustrial catalytic process. The surface oxygen species on the surface of nanocarbon materials can be classified into electroâ€� philic and nucleophilic types. Nucleophilic oxygen species preferentially react with electronâ€�poor saturated bonds in alâ€� O N+ NH2 O O O N+ N N N O O O O OH O ONH2O O OH H O- Lactone Carboxylic acid Quinone Ketone Ether Phenol Lactam Pyrro le Amide Amine Quaternary Carboxylic anhydride Pyridine oxide Pyridine Fig. 1.

SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 kanes, leading to the ODH reaction that formed alkenes. Elecâ€� trophilic oxygen species are electronâ€�deficient and will attack the electronâ€�rich C=C bonds in alkenes, leading to the further oxidation of the reactants and dehydrogenation products and subsequent combustion, thus resulting in a decrease in selecâ€� tivity. It has also been reported that the doping of a trace amount of boron oxide into the graphite lattice structure can modify the distribution of the electron cloud and inhibit the activity of the electrophilic oxygen species, leading to improved selectivity to alkene target products [16]. The nature of the active sites of carbon catalytic materials has become one of hottest topics in recent studies. Pereira et al. [17] found a linear correlation between activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and concentration of carbonâ€� yl/quinone surface groups. Kinetic studies indicated that the oxidation dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over activated carbon followed the Marsâ€�vanâ€�Kreverlan mechanism, in which the catalytic activity is related with the redox ability of the surâ€� face oxygen species. Dangsheng Suâ€™s research group [18â€’20] made a breakthrough on the reaction mechanism and the idenâ€� tification of active species by studying the reaction kinetics of ethylbenzene and butane dehydrogenation in combination with in situ Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy for the first time. Similar to most metalâ€�based catalysts, the reaction catalyzed by carbon materials is based on a dual site Langmuirâ€�Hinshelwood mechanism, and carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface are the active sites [19,20]. It was reported that diketoneâ€�like carâ€� bonyl groups can abstract hydrogen atoms from the Câ€’H bonds of alkanes to produce the corresponding alkenes. Reaction of gas phase oxygen with the abstracted hydrogen regenerates the active sites, with the formation of water as the product, as shown schematically in Fig. 3. Besides the oxidative dehydroâ€� genation of ethylbenzene, a similar reaction mechanism has been also proposed for other oxidative dehydrogenation proâ€� cesses, such as cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone on nanocarbon fibers [21], 1â€�butene to butadiene [22], propane to propene [16], and ethane to ethylene [23]. Surface defects on carbon materials play an important role in the catalytic nature of the nanocarbons. Muradov et al. [24] found that carbon materials can catalyze methane decomposiâ€� tion into hydrogen at high temperature. More than 30 types of carbon materials were demonstrated to show good catalytic activities, including activated carbon, carbon black, graphite, C60, CNT and diamond, among which carbon black showed the best specific activity. A clear correlation was observed between the catalytic activity for methane decomposition and the degree of structural order. With decreasing crystallite size of the carâ€� bon materials, a more disordered structure gave a significant increase in the catalytic activity [25]. This observation implied that the active sites for the carbonâ€�catalyzed decomposition of methane are dependent on the defects on the surface. This conâ€� clusion was further confirmed by first principle calculations by Huang et al. [26] and acetylene chemisorption by Lee et al. [27]. Liang et al. [28] found that for oxidative dehydrogenation over isobutene fullereneâ€�like graphitic carbons, no clear correlation was observed between the catalytic activity and the amount of surface functional groups, while the catalytic activity was reâ€� lated to the openness of the fullereneâ€�like cavities. So far, due to a lack of effective approaches to directly identify and quantify the types and numbers of surface defects, the mechanism and the nature of active sites for most carbonâ€�catalyzed gas phase reactions still remain controversial. Recent development of carbon nanomaterials in some new reactions offer new directions for expanding the applications of metalâ€�free carbonâ€�based catalysts. Our recent work [29] achieved the steamâ€� and cokeâ€�free dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by using nanodiamond as the catalyst (Fig. 4). With the absence of gaseous oxygen and steam, the nanodiaâ€� mond displayed three times the activity of the commercial iron oxide catalyst at a lower temperature. After a long term of reacâ€� tion, the surface of the nanodiamond was free of deposited R R H2O O2 Fig. 3.

This new strategy has a promising future in the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation industry. It was found that the nanodiamond nanoparticle is not in a complete sp3 hybridized state, and the carbon atoms on the surface were affected by the surface curvature and caused graphitization, resulting in a diâ€� amondâ€�graphene coreâ€�shell structure. The surface graphene layer is highly defective and rich in oxygenâ€�containing groups, which gave the outstanding catalytic performance of nanodiaâ€� mond. Subsequently, nanodiamond was used to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of nâ€�butane [30]. The surface of the nanoparticle tended to be transformed into a diamond core with three to ten layers of fullerene shells during reaction. During this phase transformation from the sp3 to the sp2 hyâ€� bridized state, quinoidic carbonyl groups were selectively genâ€� erated and the formation of electrophilic oxygen species was effectively suppressed, which greatly enhanced product selecâ€� tivity to the desired butenes. Recently, Frank et al. [31] investiâ€� gated the catalytic performance of a variety of carbon materials for the selective oxidation of acrolein. The results showed that carbon materials with the structure of a curved graphene sheet, such as carbon nanotubes and onionâ€�like carbon, gave good catalytic performance, while nanodiamond with a mainly sp3â€�hybridized state had a relatively low selectivity for the forâ€� mation of acrylic acid. The reaction mechanism for selective C3H4O oxidation was proposed as dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecule on the (0001) basal plane to form mobile epoxy groups, which migrated to the prismatic edge sites. The adsorption of C3H4O at the nucleophilic oxygen sites, i.e., the ketones/quinones, initiated its oxygenation by epoxy oxygen atoms to form acrylic acid (Fig. 5). 3.2. Liquid phase reactions Besides gas phase dehydrogenation reactions, the applicaâ€� tions of nanocarbons in liquid phase reactions have also atâ€� tracted increasing interest. Besso et al. [32] reported that a carbon material derived from an activation treatment of pheâ€� nolic resin can efficiently catalyze the liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexanone with a high selectivity to adipic acid of 33%. No obvious linear correlation was observed between the amount of oxygen functional groups and catalytic activity of cyclohexaâ€� none oxidation, indicating that the liquid phase oxidation proâ€� cess was much more complicated than the gas phase oxidative dehydrogenation. Kuang et al. [33] found that the nanocarbon material can be directly involved in the reaction cycle of the catalytic oxidation of alcohols. The reaction of oxygen moleâ€� cules with alcohol readily occurs over nanocarbons in nitric acid under mild conditions. In addition, carbon nanotubes can catalyze the reaction of H2O2 hydroxylation of benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene [34], in which the oxygen activation ability had been related to the surface curvature of the carbon nanotubes. A correlation between curvature and activity has also been reported in the studies of oxidative deâ€� hydrogenation of 9,10â€�dihydroanthracene using multiâ€�walled carbon nanotubes. The curvature of the nanotubes favor a strong Van der Walls interaction with the roofâ€�shaped 9,10â€�dihydroanthracene and consequently helped the catalytic reaction [35]. Feng Pengâ€™s research group has studied catalytic esterification using acidâ€�modified catalysts since 2004 [36â€’38]. Recently, they found [39] that the catalytic property of carbon nanotubes in the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexâ€� anol was inversely proportional to the amount of surface oxyâ€� gen functionalities. This effect was probably due to the localizaâ€� tion of electrons as a result of the introduction of functional groups and defects, while CNTs with better long range order and electron delocalization were preferred for the reaction. In addition, carbon materials can be used as the catalyst for wet air oxidation of phenolâ€�containing wastewater. This process is an electrophilic reaction involving a chain mechanism of the OHâ€¢ radical. However, the active sites and the factors influencâ€� ing the catalytic properties of carbon materials have not yet been determined. Yang et al. [40] suggested that carboxyl groups played the role of active sites for phenol oxidation reacâ€� tion catalyzed by carbon nanotubes. Aguilar et al. [41] proâ€� posed that the catalytic activity for the oxidation elimination reaction of nitrogenâ€�containing pollutants with carbon materiâ€� als was independent of the surface acidic groups, while alkaline ketones/benzoquinone groups as active sites were responsible for the reaction. Ma et al. [42] reported that the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was efficiently catalyzed by reduced graphene oxide (RGO) at room temperature. The zigzag edges of RGO facilitate the activation of a reactant molecule. The specific acidic or basic surface properties that originate from the functionalizations on carbon surface suggest that these should also be considered solid acid or base catalysts. Wang et al. [43] synthesized a porous sulfonated carbon mateâ€� rial by using diazo acid. The catalyst showed good catalytic performance in the reactions of esterification and condensaâ€� tion. Aminoâ€�functionalization can provide specific basicity for carbon materials. It has been reported that amiâ€� noâ€�functionalized carbon nanotubes as a solid base catalyst can efficiently catalyze the transesterification reaction of triglycerâ€� ides and methanol [44], and furthermore the catalyst is easy to recycle. Yuan et al. [45,46] studied the transesterification of phenol and dimethyl oxalate to synthesize diphenyl oxalate and oxalic acid benzyl ester, and observed that mesoporous carbon materials modified by ethylenediamine exhibited a superior catalytic activity to the supported metal oxide catalyst. Moreoâ€� ver, the modified catalyst can be reused with almost unchanged Fig. 5. Reaction pathway for the oxidation of C3H4O at a graphitic carâ€� bon surface [31]. SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 activity. Kanâ€�nari et al. [47] reported that aminoâ€�functionalized activated carbon displayed a high catalytic activity in knoevenagel condensation and transesterification reactions. Graphene oxides (GO) have good potential in organic reacâ€� tions due to their unique physical and chemical features (highly acidic and strongly oxidative abilities), and have been used in the oxidation of sulphide [48], olefins and various hydrocarâ€� bons [49], Friedelâ€�Crafts reaction [50], Azaâ€�Michael additions [51], condensation [52] and ring opening polymerization [53]. Bielawski et al. [54] investigated the catalytic activity of various synthesis reactions under mild conditions in the liquid phase. In 2010, they first reported [55] the remarkable ability of GO to catalyze the oxidation of a variety of alcohols to keâ€� tones/aldehydes, alkenes to diones, and alkynes to the correâ€� sponding hydrates. The main drawback was that the efficiency of GO was low, and a high loading (60 wt%â€“400 wt%) was reâ€� quired for typical oxidative reactions. Loh et al [56] reported that a sequential base and acid treatment can enhance the acâ€� tivity of GO by creating defects and they reduced the catalyst loading to as low as 5% and still achieved yields up to 98% for the oxidative coupling of amines to imines under mild condiâ€� tions. Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitrides (denoted as mpgâ€�C3N4) [57â€“59] is a novel graphiteâ€�like material that has also exhibited excellent catalytic activities in some liquid phase organic reactions, such as Friedelâ€�Crafts acylation reactions and cyclization of cyano and alkynyl compounds. The reactant molâ€� ecules can be activated by hydrogen bonding to amino groups or electron transfer with mpgâ€�C3N4. Alkaliâ€�treated carbon niâ€� trides can be used as a solid base catalyst to catalyze Knoevenagel condensation and transesterification reactions [60]. A series of studies by Wang et al. [61] demonstrated that doped mpgâ€�C3N4 had excellent catalytic performance in liquid phase oxidation reactions. By using clean hydrogen peroxide or oxygen as the oxidizing agent, the reactions could overcome a serious of pollution problems present in the current convenâ€� tional oxidation process, while also possessing the advantages of high selectivity, easy separation from the products and recyâ€� cling. Boronâ€� and fluorineâ€�containing mesoporous carbon niâ€� tride polymers exhibited good catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone [62]. With a few percent boron and fluorine, the selectivity towards cyâ€� clohexanone was as high as 100% (conversion of 5.3%). Boâ€� ronâ€�doped C3N4 can efficiently catalyze the liquid phase oxidaâ€� tion of toluene/ethylbenzene to benzaldehyde/acetophenone with high selectivity (nearly 100%), as well as many other arâ€� omatic hydrocarbon oxidation reactions [63]. 3.3. Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions Highly active catalysts for the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) have long been regarded as a key to the performance of fuel cells. Although Ptâ€�based catalysts are regarded as the best cathode materials for fuel cells, their large scale commercializaâ€� tion is impeded by poor durability, CO deactivation, high cost and limited supply. To reduce or replace the Ptâ€�based elecâ€� trodes in fuel cells, extensive efforts have been devoted to deâ€� velop some alternative ORR catalysts, such as transition metal chalcogenides, enzyme electrocatalytic catalysts and nitrogen enriched carbon materials. In situ nitrogenâ€�doped carbon nanotubes and mesoporous graphite arrays have been considâ€� ered potential metalâ€�free catalysts due to their excellent elecâ€� trocatalytic activity, low cost, long durability and environmenâ€� tal friendliness [13,64,65]. The nitrogen atom can be bonded to the carbon atom through five covalent electrons because of their similar radius, and hence by controlling the amount of nitrogen incorporated or the doping method, the physical and chemical properties of the carbon material can be altered, improving the electronic properties, conductivity, basicity, oxidation stability and cataâ€� lytic performance [64,66]. Nitrogenâ€�doping into carbon nanostructure materials can be performed in two ways. One is by in situ doping during synthesis by using nitrogen containing precursors, which yield a homogeneous incorporation of niâ€� trogen into the entire carbon material. The other way is by postâ€�synthesis treatment of the carbon materials with nitroâ€� genâ€�containing precursors (e.g., NH3), which leads to surface functionalization only without changing the bulk properties. Nitrogenâ€�doped carbons are generally synthesized by the pyâ€� rolysis of transition metal macrocyclic compounds [67] or the reaction of metal salts with nitrogenâ€�containing precursor [68]. Because the complete removal of metal contaminants is so difâ€� ficult even by an extreme purification treatment, the catalytic mechanism of ORR still remains controversial regarding the role of the metal present in a very small amount. In 2006, a nitrogenâ€�doped carbon catalyst was prepared by the decompoâ€� sition of acetonitrile vapor on pure alumina which contained less than 0.0001% metal contamination [69]. Compared with the iron supported on alumina catalyst, the nitrogenâ€�doped carbon supported on alumina with no metal impurity was also quite active for ORR, demonstrating that the metal was not required for ORR activity. Liu et al. [70] reported the fabricaâ€� tion of novel nitrogenâ€�doped ordered mesoporous graphitic arrays (NOMGAs) on the basis of a metalâ€�free nanocasting technology. This material exhibited a much higher electrocataâ€� lytic activity and stability than the commercial Ptâ€“C catalyst for the ORR reaction. The superior performance was attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the catalyst. Recentâ€� ly, Gong et al. [65] found that vertically aligned nitroâ€� genâ€�containing CNTs (VAâ€�NCNTs) act as extremely effective metalâ€�free ORR electrocatalysts (Fig. 6). The metalâ€�free VAâ€�NCNTs were shown to catalyze a fourâ€�electron ORR process free from CO poisoning with a much higher electrocatalytic activity and better long term operation stability than commerâ€� cial Ptâ€�based electrodes in alkaline electrolytes. They attributed the improved catalytic performance to the electronâ€�accepting ability of nitrogen atoms, which increased the net positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane. This result has also provided new exâ€� perimental evidence as well as a promising prospect for the development of alternative metalâ€�free electrocatalysts to platâ€� inum. At present, at least three different forms of the nitrogen atâ€� om have been found on the nanocarbon surface, including pyrâ€� SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 rolic, pyridinic, and graphitic nitrogen (Fig. 7) [71]. The exact catalytic role for each of the nitrogen forms in nanocarbon ORR catalysts is still a matter of discussion. It is generally believed that the pyridinic nitrogen atoms on the edges of graphitic planes are active sites in the catalytic process [72â€’74]. Howâ€� ever, recent studies have suggested that the graphitic nitrogen atoms are very important for catalyzing ORR [70,75]. In addiâ€� tion, it was also reported recently that the nitrogen atoms inâ€� crease the interaction with the oxygen atoms through their electron donating function. The anion radical, O2â€’, formed at the surface, is more effective for Nâ€�containing carbons [76,77]. One atom thick graphene sheets with a two dimensional (2D) planar geometry configuration are superior to CNTs, and can further facilitate electron transport, and hence it can be used as a more effective electrode material. Recently, Nâ€�doped graphene have been shown to have excellent ORR performance similar to that of Nâ€�doped carbon nanotubes with the same nitrogen content [78]. Mullen et al. [79] recently reported the synthesis of grapheneâ€�based carbon nitride nanosheets (Gâ€�CN Nanosheets). The resulting Gâ€�CN nanosheets not only posâ€� sessed the advantages of a high nitrogen content, thin thickâ€� nesses and high surface areas, but also showed excellent elecâ€� trocatalytic performance for ORR, including high electrocataâ€� lytic activity, long term stability, and high selectivity. All these performance were superior to those observed for CN sheets without graphene and commercial Ptâ€�C catalysts. The appliâ€� cation of other carbon materials in electrocatalysis has also attracted attention. Ozaki et al. [80] reported excellent ORR activity in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 with shellâ€�like nanocarbons proâ€� duced by the carbonization of furan resin in the presence of acetylacetonates and metal phthalocyanines. 3.4.

SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 used for the production of renewable, nonpolluting fuels and organic chemicals. So far, the catalysts for photocatalytic reacâ€� tions are mainly semiconductors and transition metal comâ€� plexes. However, these materials suffer from many disadâ€� vantages, such as low conversion efficiency, low selectivity of products, and poor stability. Graphitic carbon nitrides (gâ€�C3N4) are polymer semiconâ€� ductor materials with a two dimensional graphene layered structure. Owning to their more stable structure and better photocatalytic performance compared with traditional polymer semiconductors, they have good potential in the utilization of solar energy as a unique metalâ€�free semiconductor photocataâ€� lyst. Wang et al. [81] prepared carbon nitride (gâ€�C3N4) with a conjugated polymerâ€�graphite phase by using heatâ€�induced selfâ€�polymerization of cyanamid. A recent breakthrough was achieved by using this material for water splitting into hydroâ€� gen under visible light in the absence of a metal, opening a new pathway for the study of photocatalytic materials. The gâ€�C3N4 material has an appropriate bandgap of 2.7 eV, corresponding to an optical wavelength of 460 nm. Both the HOMO and the LUMO are compatible with the oxidation and reduction potenâ€� tial of water, that is, the electron vacancy (â€œholeâ€�) in the HOMO is sufficiently reactive and can oxidize water to oxygen, while the electron in the LUMO has enough reduction potential to reduce water to hydrogen [82] (Fig. 8). To further solve the problems in the photocatalytic process of low quantum effiâ€� ciency, frequent photogenerated carrier recombination and too large bandgap (Î» < 460 nm) with a low utilization of solar enâ€� ergy, extensive research efforts have been devoted to the modiâ€� fication of gâ€�C3N4 to improve the chemical composition, bandgap structure, optical absorption properties and electronic transport properties. These methods include copolymerization modification, mesoporous modification, synthesis pathway improvement and coâ€�catalyst modification, and have resulted in significant improvements in the photocatalytic decomposiâ€� tion of water into hydrogen [83]. In addition, the bottom of the conduction band of gâ€�C3N4 is 1.3 V, which allows the activation of molecular oxygen to suâ€� peroxide radicals. Meanwhile the top of the valance band is 1.4 V, which means that with gâ€�C3N4, water or hydroxyl cannot be directly oxidized to a free hydroxyl radical. Therefore, gâ€�C3N4 can be applied in the selective synthesis of the organic photocatalyst by using molecular oxygen as the oxidant, inâ€� volving alkane oxidation, alcohols oxidation and olefins oxidaâ€� tion [82]. Taking oxidation dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde as an example, gâ€�C3N4 gave more than 99% selectivity and 57% conversion under visible light irradiation for 3 h at 100 oC (Table 2). As compared with the traditional catalysts, this green organic selective oxidation route has sevâ€� eral advantages, including mild reaction conditions, visible light source and molecular oxygen oxidant, and in addition a reacâ€� tion system with neither metal, strong acid nor strong alkali. Besides the applications of gâ€�C3N4 in photocatalysis, compoâ€� site materials composed of nanocarbon and other metalâ€�free catalysts can also provide new routes for photocatalysis. Reâ€� cently, Baeg et al. [84] reported the synthesis of a novel graâ€� pheneâ€�based visible lightâ€�active photocatalyst which improved the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis systems. By adding porphyrin enzymes, the graphene catalyzed the production of formic acid from CO2 and sunlight. The product can be used for the chemicals and fuel cell in the plastics industry. This graâ€� pheneâ€�based visible lightâ€�active photocatalyst exhibited a higher catalytic activity and much higher overall efficiency than other catalysts. It also had good electron transport capability and the larger surface area of graphene which can contribute to speeding up the chemical reactions. 4. Macroâ€�shaping of nanocarbon materials The large scale application of nanoscopic carbon materials with a loose powder structure as the catalyst or catalyst supâ€� port is hampered because of the large pressure drop across the catalyst bed and the problems of mass and heat transfer in inâ€� dustrial fixed bed reactors. Therefore, the macroscopic shaping of nanocarbon materials is one of the key issues for the large scale applications of these metalâ€�free catalysts. Practical Fig. 8.

SUN Xiaoyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 508â€“523 nanocarbon catalysts should possess sufficient mechanical strength, an open macroscopic structure and long term stabilâ€� ity. To get such a macroscopic nanocarbon structure, one method is the immobilization of nanocarbon onto other porous materials with a well defined shape and mechanical strength. These materials used as catalyst showed a similar or even betâ€� ter catalytic performance to commercial powder carbon mateâ€� rials. The macroscopic nanocarbon supports include foam metâ€� als, natural minerals, porous carbon and ceramics, which are usually in situ synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of the active metal onto a porous support. Jarrah et al. [85] successâ€� fully immobilized carbon nanofibers on a porous nickel supâ€� port. The surface area of the Niâ€�CNFsâ€�foam composite was inâ€� creased with the loading of the CNFs from less than 1 to 30 m2/g and had a pore volume of 1 cm3/g. Su et al. [86,87] reâ€� ported that Basalt lava erupted from Mount Etna containing iron oxide particles can be used as catalysts and supports to synthesize and immobilize carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. The composites obtained were highly active and stable cataâ€� lysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styâ€� rene. GarcÃ­aâ€�BordejÃ© et al. [88] used a Î³â€�alumina washâ€�coating layer impregnated with a nickel salt to cover the walls of a macroporous ordierite ceramic monolith. The composite of ceramic monoliths and carbon nanofibres (CNFs) with the avâ€� erage diameters of 5â€“30 nm was prepared by the catalytic growth of CNFs. Vanhaecke et al. [89] realized the catalytic growth of carbon fiber array on a SiC substrate in a floating ferrocene and toluene solution. This material was used as a microâ€�reactor that was efficiently employed in a diesel particuâ€� late filter as well as in heterogeneous catalysis. Dai et al. [90] used dopamine or dopamine polymer as the carbon source and silica spheres as template to make a polymer/silica nanocomâ€� posite that then was carbonized in nitrogen to synthesize holâ€� low carbon spheres and â€œyolkâ€�shellâ€™ structured carbon nanoâ€� composite. Recently, our research group [91] reported an ion exchanged resin method in solid process at relatively low temâ€� peratures (400â€’800 oC) to prepare carbon nanotube spheres with a mmâ€�scale and highly graphitized structure (Fig. 9). This method processes the advantages of low cost, easy operation and low energy consumption. The resulting CNT spheres exâ€� hibited excellent catalytic activity and higher selectivity for styrene in ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation reactions than commercial carbon nanotube powders. Chizari et al. [92] recently successfully prepared macroscopic shaped Nâ€�doped carbon nanotubes (Nâ€�CNTs) on SiC foam. This Nâ€�CNTs/SiC composite showed a higher desulfurization performance comâ€� pared with an unsupported Nâ€�CNTs for hydrogen sulfide oxidaâ€� tion, and also exhibited high stability during the test at high space velocity. 5. Conclusion and outlook Metals and metal oxides have been widely used as catalysts in various industrial processes. Nanocarbon materials as a novâ€� el inorganic metalâ€�free catalyst have the following unique adâ€� vantages compared with the metal catalyst: (1) Nanocarbons are composed of nanographiteâ€�structure unit cells, and have good electrical conductivity and ability to store/release elecâ€� trons. They have high specific surface areas and pore volumes and large amounts of surface defects. Heteroatoms (N, O, Pâ€¦) are bonded or doped to the defects in carbon materials to form a variety of surface functional groups. (2) Nanocarbon materiâ€� als can be widely used in a variety of catalytic processes, and have excellent catalytic properties in some typical reactions. For example, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, they enabled the reaction to be performed with a high activity at a lower temperature, as well as with no coke formation. Nanocarbon used as the electrocatalyst in ORR showed comâ€� parable activity and stability to the commercial Ptâ€�based cataâ€� lyst, while they have low cost and high corrosion resistance. (3) Owing to their wide availability, environmental friendliness and no heavy metal pollution, carbon catalysts are candidates for green chemistry with low emission and an efficient use of the chemical feedstock. There are still many key issues and challenges that need to be solved in nanocarbon metalâ€�free catalysis: (1) The use of nanocarbon materials in gas phase reactions is mainly limited to the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Their applications in new reaction systems are urgently required. Although various carbon materials have exhibited excellent catalytic performance, there is still a long way before their commercialization. Nitrogen or boronâ€�doped nanocarbons are promising carbon materials. However, it is still very challenging to determine the exact location of the nitrogen atoms in the nanocarbon structure, the chemical nature of the active sites, and the doping mechanism. Carbon nitrides and doped nanocarbon composites have been shown to be a new route for the development of carbon materials. (2) Many fundamental aspects including the nature of the active sites, reaction mechanism and the exact role of the interface in catalytic process are still not clear. A reliable qualitative and quantitative identification method is needed to identify the structure and properties of the surface defects and functional groups. The contribution of metal impurities in a trace amount to the catalytic activity is still a matter of conversy. Therefore, in situ characterization techniques under complex conditions need to be developed to monitor the catalytic reaction process. By the synthesis and control of model carbon materials to give a clean surface and specific functional groups, they can be combined with reaction kinetics and theoretical calculations to probe the nature of the carbon catalysis. (3) For industrial applications, it is essential to develop simple and highly efficient approaches for the large scale production of carbon nanomaterials with a defined structure and surface chemistry. Some progress have been made so far, but nevertheless, various reaction parameters still need to be explored and optimized for the large scale conditions, improvement of the product purity and yield and reducing the cost. Although the large scale application of nanocarbon metalâ€�free catalysts is still far away, the development of new materials and the understanding of the structure, nature and application of carbon materials have become deeper. Therefore, nanocarbon catalysts will undoubtedly receive more extensive attention in the field of material science and chemical catalysis.
