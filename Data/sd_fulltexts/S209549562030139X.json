Developing high power and energy supercapacitors (SCs) is a long-pursued goal for the application in transportation and energy storage station. Herein, a rationally-designed Co-doped nickel oxide nanosheets@carbon-welded carbon nanotube foam (Co-doped NiO@WCNTF) as freestanding electrode is successfully prepared for high power and energy SCs. The WCNTF framework with high specific surface area provides three dimensional highly conductive network for fast charge transport and ensures high loading of active materials (9.2 mg/cm2). Moreover, porous Co-doped NiO nanosheets uniformly anchored on the WCNTF framework enable rapid charge kinetics due to the high intrinsic conductivity of Co-doped NiO nanosheets and their good contact with conductive WCNTF substrate. As a result, the unique integrated electrode with 3D architecture exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 11.45 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2, outstanding rate capability (11.45 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2 and a capacitance retention of 86.2% at 30 mA/cm2) and good cycling stability, suggesting great potential for high performance supercapacitor. Graphical abstract A high-loading binder-free Co-doped NiO@WCNTF (9.2 mg/cm2) electrode with 3D architecture, high ionic and electronic conductivity is successfully synthesized, showing an ultrahigh specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability and good cycling stability.

Among different ESS, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted great attention due to their ultrahigh power density, long-cycle life, low-cost, environmental friendliness and wide working temperature range, which has demonstrated great prospects in various applications, such as transportation, aerospace and starters demanding large charge/discharge currents [3–7]. Unfortunately, the low energy density (E) of SCs greatly limits their wider–spread applications. According to the equation: E = 1/2CV 2, the improvement of energy density (E) can be achieved by maximizing the specific capacitance (C) which is closely related to the electrochemical performance of electrode materials [8,9]. Compared with carbon-based materials [10–12], pseudocapacitive materials, especially transition metal oxides (e.g., Co3O4, Fe3O4, RuO2 and NiO), have been widely used as electrodes for high energy supercapacitors due to their much higher electrochemical activity [13–17]. Nickel oxide (NiO), a p-type semiconductor, is regarded as a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode material due to its high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost and easy availabilities [18,19]. Over the past decade, nickel oxides with various morphologies as electrodes were synthesized as shown in Table S1, exhibiting much higher specific capacitance [20–28]. However, the poor intrinsic conductivity and sever aggregation of NiO severely hinders the charge transfer during redox reaction, resulting in compromises of power density and cycling stability as well as lower specific capacitance than theoretical value. Towards the development of high-performance supercapacitors that can deliver high power and energy density simultaneously, much effort has been focused on the rational design of NiO-based materials with high electrical conductivity. Effective strategies include metal doping in NiO (e.g., Co-doped NiO) to enhance the conductivity of NiO semiconductor by introducing impurity band effects [29,30], and directly in-situ anchoring nanosized NiO on conductive substrates with high specific surface area. In a variety of conductive scaffolds such as metal foams (e.g., Ni foam [31]) and carbon materials (e.g., grapheme [32–34], carbon fiber [35] and carbon cloth [36]), carbon nanotube (CNT) assemblies are regarded as promising supports for NiO-based nanostructures due to its lightweight, excellent electrical conductivities and high specific surface area [37–40]. Ascribed to these superior merits, various NiO-based nanostructures combined with CNTs were prepared for supercapacitors [41]. For instance, Qian et al. fabricated NiO/CNT composites on nickel foam by electrophoretic deposition and achieved a specific capacitance of 1075 F/gat a current density of 5 A/g [42]. In combination of core–shell structured NiO@CNT powder with polymer binder, conductive-agent and metal current collector, the final hybrid electrode possesses enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of 1844 F/g at 1 A/g [43]. However, achieving high rate performance in electrodes, especially integrated electrodes with high mass loading, is still a challenge. Compared with CNT powder and film, CNT foam provides more effective combination of nanosized NiO and more electron/ion transfer channels for redox reaction, showing a great prospect for the preparation of high-loading pseudocapacitive composite electrode toward high-rate supercapacitors [44–47]. Herein, a well-designed architecture of Co-doped NiO nanosheets uniformly anchored on the carbon-welded carbon nanotube foam (WCNTF) current collector was prepared via a facile hydrothermal method followed by high-temperature annealing. In a typical Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite, the WCNTF framework with interconnected conductive scaffold and high surface area provides fast charge transport channels and ensures high loading of Co-doped NiO nanosheets. Benefited from the rational architecture, the obtained composite as freestanding electrode shows excellent electrochemical properties with an ultrahigh specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability and good cycling stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis 2.1.1 Material Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), ethylene imine polymer (PEI, –(CH2CH2NH) n –), citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). All the chemical reagents are analytical grade. 2.1.2 Synthesis of carbon-welded carbon nanotube foam (WCNTF) Pristine CNT foam was made by a floating catalyst CVD process, as reported in our previous work [48]. Subsequently, amorphous carbon is deposited on the as–prepared raw CNT foam at 1100 °C via CVD method with ethylene (70 sccm), hydrogen (140 sccm) and argon (250 sccm) to obtain WCNTF. The secondary deposition of amorphous carbon here increases the structural stability and wettability of the foam. Moreover, the joint-welded CNTs in WCNTF construct interconnected conductive network for rapid charge transport. 2.1.3 Synthesis of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF Co-doped NiO@WCNTF was prepared via a facial chemical process. In the synthesis procedure, 1.32 g PEI as surface modifier, 6.98 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.74 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 5.76 g citric acid were well mixed in deionized water (60 mL)with vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature, followed by the addition of concentrated ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) to adjust the pH value to 9. Afterward, a piece of WCNTF (3 cm × 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was gently immersed into the above solution and kept for 1 h. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal reaction at 210 °C for 8 h. After cooling and ultra-sonication, the foam was washed with DI water and methanol for several times to remove the residual organic constituents and drying in a vacuum chamber for 12 h at 120 °C. The sample was eventually annealed in a furnace at 400 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere to obtain the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF. For comparison, NiO@WCNTF and Co-doped NiO was fabricated in a same process without the addition of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and WCNTF, respectively 2.2 Characterization The scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta400 FEG, FEI) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI) equipped with an Apollo 40 SDD X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were employed to investigate the morphologies and elemental composition of the prepared samples. The crystallinity and phase purity were characterized by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker AXS). The oxidation states and surface chemical composition of products were characterized by inductively coupled plasma-Atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 XI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an Al Kα radiation. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the prepared samples were investigated using a Tristar II 3020 Surface Area Analyzer. The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method and the Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) model were used to test and calculate the specific surface areas and the pore size distributions, respectively. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, without mixing with any binder or conductive additives, was utilized as the working electrode with the area of 2.25 cm2, thickness of 200 μm and mass loading of 9.2 mg/cm2. For comparison, NiO powder electrode and Co-doped NiO powder electrode were prepared by a traditional slurry-cast method. Powder (80 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%), and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%) were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to form a homogenous slurry. Then, the slurry was coated onto a nickel foam with a coating area and mass loading of 2.25 cm2 and 9.2 mg/cm2, respectively. Electrochemical properties of the prepared samples were carried out in a three–electrode system at room temperature on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with the prepared materials as a working electrode, Hg/HgO as a reference electrode and platinum (Pt) plate as a counter electrode. The CV curves were measured within a 0.0–0.6 V (versus Hg/HgO) potential window at various scan rates. The EIS measurements of all of the samples were conducted at open–circuit voltage in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an alternating current amplitude of 5 mV. GCD curves were obtained between 0 and 0.55 V.The areal capacitance CA (mF/cm2) and mass specific capacitance was calculated according to the following Equations. (1) C A = I Δ t / A Δ V (2) C m = I Δ t / m Δ V where I (mA) represents the discharge current, Δt (s) represents the discharge time, ΔV (V) is the voltage range, A (cm2) is the active area of electrode and m (g) is the mass of active materials (Co-doped NiO in composite). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) schematically illustrates the preparation process of the lamellar-structured Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite. In brief, the pristine carbon nanotube foam (CNTF) was obtained by the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition method [48]. The amorphous carbon was first integrated with the CNTF via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to obtain the carbon-welded carbon nanotube foam (WCNTF) [48]. Successively, Co-doped NiO nanosheets were uniformly in-situ anchored on the CNTs in the WCNTF via hydrothermal reaction and high temperature annealing. During the process, the deposited amorphous carbon effectively ensures the structural stability of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite, avoiding the structure shrinkage in liquid and damage during various deformation (Fig. S1). The morphologies of pristine CNTF, WCNTF and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1(b), the pristine CNTF is assembled by numerous carbon nanotubes, showing a 3D porous architecture. After carbon deposition, CNTs in the foam are effectively welded together and form interconnected network in WCNTF (Fig. 1c). The joint-welded structure greatly shortens electron transport pathway ensuring fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, the amorphous carbon coating effectively increases the hydrophilia of the CNTF, providing more accessible surface area for pseudocapacitive material depositing. As shown in Fig. 1(d), numerous Co-doped NiO nanosheets are homogeneously embedded in the interconnected WCNTF, achieving high-loading Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite (9.2 mg/cm2). High-resolution SEM image in Fig. 1(e) reveals that the vertical Co-doped NiO nanosheets on the WCNTF formwork form a cross-linked lamellar structure and numerous open channels, which is beneficial to the rapid transport of electrons and ions. Such well-defined cross-linked architecture was also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1(f), the Co-doped NiO nanosheets are successfully wrapped on the carbon nanotubes. Each domain is composed of numerous Co-doped NiO nanosheets with the size of ~100 nm (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1(h) shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Co-doped NiO nanosheets on the WCNTF formwork. It displays that the Co-doped NiO nanosheets possess interplanar d-spacings of 0.238 nm and 0.206 nm, which is agree well with the lattice planes of (111) and (200) of NiO crystals, manifesting a high degree of crystallinity [29]. This result demonstrates that the Co has been successfully doped into NiO crystals, rather than forms another phase. Additionally, the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern depicted in Fig. 1(i) further indicates the polycrystalline behavior of Co-doped NiO. Fig. 1(j–m) and Fig. S2 show the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite. Clearly, the elements of Co, Ni, O and C are observed without other impurity and homogeneously distributed. These results further illustrate the uniform deposition of Co-doped NiO nanosheets in the WCNTF, which is consist with the SEM and TEM analysis. The porous structures of WCNTF and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite were profiled by N2 sorption behavior at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Both samples show no adsorption at low relative pressures (P/P 0< 0.01), visible hysteresis loop extending from P/P 0 0.5 to 0.85, and large tails at high relative pressures (P/P 0> 0.9), exhibiting typical type III isotherms, indicative of mesoporous and microporous structure. Note that Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite shows lager isotherms of mesopores than WCNTF, suggesting more porous structures derived from the cross-linked Co-doped NiO nanosheets. This result can be further proved by the pore size distribution and specific surface area. As shown in Fig. 2(b), compared with the WCNTF, the pore structure in Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite is better developed, mainly ranging from mesopores to macropores (2–100 nm), which is excellently consistent with SEM/TEM observations. The specific surface area based on Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and pore volume of Co–doped NiO@WCNTF composite are 73 m2/g and 0.13 cm3/g, respectively, higher than these of the WCNTF (59 m2/g and 0.08 cm3/g). The large number of mesopores and macropores in Co–doped NiO@WCNTF are advantageous to excellent electrolyte infiltration and rapid reaction kinetics. To further study the phase composition and crystallographic structures, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to obtain typical patterns of the WCNTF, NiO@WCNTF and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the observed diffraction peak around 26.1° in all samples is related to the CNTs [42]. Other diffraction peaks (2θ>30°) for NiO@WCNTF and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite are well indexed and exactly matched to the standard cubic NiO structure (JCPDS: 47-1049). No diffraction peaks from possible impurities, such as Co and Co3O4, are observed in the pattern of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF. It further indicates that Co is successfully doped into the lattice of NiO without changing the original NiO crystal structure. Furthermore, the obviously broadened reflection peaks are observed in Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, indicating the introduction of lattice vacancies by doping. This variation is attributed to the local lattice distortions of NiO structure due to the substitution of Co2+ ions, which are smaller (0.79 Å) than Ni2+ ions (0.83 Å) [29]. Moreover, companied with the introduction of lattice vacancies, a large number of free holes in the valence band will be generated in Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, which is conducive to improving the electrical conductivity of NiO and reducing the charge transfer resistance of the foam [49]. Inductively coupled plasma–Atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was conducted to investigate the detail chemical composition and valence of Co–doped NiO@WCNTF composite, as listed in Table S2. It is shown that the contents of Co and Ni are 35 at% and 65 at%, respectively. The large Co doping ratio unambiguously introduces more defects into the lattice of NiO, which is consistent with XRD analysis. Meanwhile, the chemical composition and status of Ni, Co and O in the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF composite was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). As shown in the survey spectra (Fig. S2), four obvious peaks of Ni 2p, Co 2p, C 1s and O 1s in Co-doped NiO@WCNTF are detected, which is in accordance with EDX results. Fig. 2(d) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p region of the doped sample. The Ni 2p spectrum shows four distinguished peaks at 854.35 eV, 856.04 eV, 872.45 eV and 874.04 eV, corresponding to the different oxidative states of Ni2+ 2p 3/2, Ni3+ 2p 3/2, Ni2+ 2p 1/2 and Ni3+ 2p 1/2, respectively. Simultaneously, the signals at ~861.38 eV and ~879.95 eV are characteristics of satellite peaks derived from shake-up process. Moreover, the intensity of Ni3+ in doped sample clearly increases, which might be mainly ascribed to the more defects generated in NiO lattice during Co-doping [50,51]. The high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p is displayed in Fig. 2(e). The various oxidation peaks located at 779.87 eV, 781.36 eV, 795.37 eV and 796.66 eV are reported for the Co3+ 2p 3/2, Co2+ 2p 3/2, Co3+ 2p 1/2 and Co2+ 2p 1/2 states, respectively [52]. The two satellite peaks at the binding energy of 786.00 eV (Co 2p 3/2) and 803.58 eV (Co 2p 1/2) further indicate the presence of Co in the as-prepared sample, which is in good agreement with the reported XPS peak positions [52]. In addition, the O 1s spectrum in Fig. 2(f) is deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.77 eV, 531.18 eV, and 532.17 eV, revealing the existence of O2–, C = O and OH–/H2O, respectively [53,54]. Based on abovementioned analysis, the high-loading Co–doped NiO@WCNTF composite possesses interconnected conductive network, high intrinsic conductivity and well–developed pore structure derived from Co-doped NiO nanosheets. Such unique 3D architecture can provide continuous channels for rapid electron/ions transport, improving the electrochemical performance of electrode. The electrochemical behavior of freestanding Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode was measured in three-electrode system using 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 3 (a) displays the comparative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of pure NiO, Co-doped NiO and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in the voltage window of 0–0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO). From the CV curves, all the electrodes exhibit a pair of redox peaks resulting from the faradaic redox reaction between Ni(II) and Ni(III) similar to previous studies [55,56]. For the pure NiO, the CV curve shows a couple of redox peaks at around 0.45 and 0.35 V [24,34], respectively, which are ascribed to the following redox reaction (2): (2) NiO + O H − ↔ NiOOH + e − After Co-doping, the shapes of redox peaks for Co-doped NiO and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF change obviously. The different CV curves are the consequence of different nanostructure, chemical and crystal structure (e.g., Co-doping). In comparison, the integrated area under CV curve of Co-doped NiO is much larger than pure NiO. It indicates the Co-doping greatly increases the electrochemical activity of pure NiO, resulting in enhanced specific capacitance of Co-doped NiO. After compositing with the interconnectWCNTF, theintegral area of CV curve for Co-doped NiO@WCNTF is further increased. Meanwhile, different from the obvious polarization of pure Co-doped NiO, the response of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF is close to ideal reversible faradaic redox behaviorwith slight polarization,indicatingthe most superiority of the electrodes. For powder–cast NiO and Co-doped NiO electrodes, the server aggregation usually blocks the electrolyte ions transport, resulting in lower utilization of active materials for faradic redoxreaction (Fig. S3). In contrast, the binder-free Co-doped NiO@WCNTF possesses excellent conductivity, interconnective open channels, porous structure, and high specific surface areas, ensuring more effective active sites for faradaic redox action. This phenomenon was further confirmed by galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements.As shown in Fig. 3(b), the discharge curves of the samples at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 in the voltage window of 0–0.55 V show nonlinear line profiles with the plateau, further supporting the typical faradic reaction characteristic of the NiO-based electrodes. The discharging curve mainly shows two different regions: (i) the linear variation of potential with time corresponds to double layer capacitance owing to the charge separation at electrode/electrolyte interface; and (ii) the deviation of slope of potential versus time profile discloses the redox reaction between electrolyte and NiO-based electrodes [55]. As expected, the discharge time of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF are much longer than NiO powder electrode and Co-doped NiO powder electrode, showing the best electrochemical performance. Fig. 3(c) shows the CV curves of the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF at different scan rates from 5 mV/s to 30 mV/s. A pair of redox peaks signifying typical pseudocapacitive behavior is clearly observed in all figures. With the increasing scan rate, the anodic peaks move toward higher potential and the cathodic peaks move toward lower potential at the same time, which may be attributed to the increasingelectric polarization and irreversible faradic reactions as high scan rate [57–59]. For ultrahigh-loading Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, the couple of redox peaks still can be observed even at the scan rates of 30 mV/s, revealing the outstanding electrochemical reversibility and rate performance. The GCD curves at different current densities (5–30 mA/cm2) were also measured to estimate the rate capability of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, as shown in Fig. 3(d, e). All GCD curves of high loading Co-doped NiO@WCNTF exhibit good platform rather than linear curves, further illustrating its redox reaction characteristic and are quite consistent with the result of CV curves in Fig. 3(c). The quasi–symmetrical curves indicate high coulombic efficiency and outstanding reversibility of electrode. Moreover, the discharge curve at a high current density of 30 mA/cm2 still shows unchangeable shape with small IR drop, indicating the low internal resistance and excellent high-rate performance of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode (Fig. 3(e)). The areal capacity values of Co–doped NiO@WCNTF are calculated from the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves at the current densities ranging from 5 to 30 mA/cm2, as summarized in Fig. 3(f). The specific capacitance of 11.45 F/cm2 (1244 F/g) is achieved at 5 mA/cm2, and the high capacitance retention can be up to 86.2% at a high current density of 30 mA/cm2, further confirming the outstanding capacitance and high-rate performances. The electrochemical performance of high-loading Co–doped NiO@WCNTF is much higher than pure NiO and Co-doped NiO, and even higher than or comparable to many other reported NiO based electrodes (Table S3) [30,60–66]. The cycling stability and the Coulombic efficiency of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode was tested at a current density of 15 mA/cm2. As shown in Fig. 3(g), the increase of specific capacitance during initial cycles (1–900 cycles) is related to the electrochemical activation of ultrahigh loading active materials in Co–doped NiO@WCNTF [67]. The capacitance of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF remains at almost 86% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles, indicating excellent cyclic stability. Fig. 3(h) demonstrates the GCD curves of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF at 15 mA/cm2 before and after 1500 cycles. Obviously, the GCD curve at 1500th cycles of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF shows a slight decrease of discharge time, further indicating high electrochemical stability of electrode. The merits to achieving such excellent electrochemical properties with high rate and long lifetime of the binder-free Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 (a). Firstly, the interconnected WCNTF framework is used as the conductive scaffold to provide short pathways for rapid charge transport. Meanwhile, the high accessible surface area of WCNTF ensures high-loading of pseudo-active materials, which is conducive to improving the specific capacitance of the electrode. Secondly, Co doping greatly enhances the intrinsic electronic conductivity of NiO via the generation of oxygen vacancies and holes (Fig. 4(b) [29,49,68]. Moreover, the in–situ growth of Co-doped NiO nanosheets on the WCNTF without binders and conductive additives can also effectively decrease the charge transfer resistance of the interface between Co-doped NiO and conductive WCNTF, improving the fast charge kinetics. Thirdly, the interconnected Co-doped NiO@WCNTF possesses highly open channels and well-developed pore structure derived from the cross–linked lamellar structures of Co-doped NiO nanosheets in the WCNTF. These channels and pore structures accommodate the rapid electrolyte diffusion and infiltration into interior parts of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF, resulting in excellent rate capability and cycling stability of electrode. From these beneficial results, the obtained Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode possesses high ionic and electronic conductivity. To further investigate the fast charge kinetics within the electrodes and verify the role of the electrode structure, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of NiO, Co-doped NiO and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF was performed in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz by applying an alternating current voltage with an amplitude of 5 mV, as shown in Fig. 4(c) [16]. In the Nyquist plot, three samples exhibit different shapes. The high-frequency intercept on the real axis of the semicircle represents the intrinsic ohmic resistance (R s) including material resistance, ionic resistance of electrolyte and the contact resistance between active material and current collector. From the insert in Fig. 4(c), the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF reveals the lowest resistance of 0.61Ω, indicating higher ionic and electronic conductivity than NiO and Co-doped NiO. The pseudo-semicircle arc at high frequency region corresponds to the resistance (R ct) of charge-transfer, which is closely related with the conductivity of electrodes. Clearly, a much smaller semicircle is observed for Co-doped NiO (R ct = 4.60 Ω) in comparison of pure NiO (R ct = 10.45 Ω), implying the higher conductivity of Co-doped NiO. For the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode (R ct = 0.9 Ω), the diameter of semicircle is further decreased. The greatly reduced interfacial impedance for Co-doped NiO@WCNTF is mainly ascribed to fast charge transfer over the interfaces of electrolyte/Co-doped NiO/conductive WCNTFand strongly support the CV, GCD, and electrochemical stability measurements. At the relatively low frequencies, the 45° inclined line is clearly observed in all electrodes, corresponding to the Warburg impedance. This result indicates that the faradaic reaction of NiO linked to pseudo–capacitance is controlled by ion diffusion/transport from the electrolyte to the electrode surface. The Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode presents the shortest Warburg-type line among all the three electrodes, suggesting its well-defined pore structure and better ion diffusion capability [69]. The vertical lines at the lower-frequency represent the resistances of ion diffusion in the electrode, respectively, which is closelyrelated to the pore structures and accessible surface area of electrode. For ideal supercapacitors, the impedance plot at the low-frequency should be a line perpendicular (θ = 90°) to the real axis at low frequency. In our work, the slopes of straight lines are 66°, 58° and 74.4° for NiO, Co-doped NiO and Co-doped NiO@WCNTF [57]. Clearly, the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode shows most vertical lines along the imaginary axis, indicating its faster ion transport and ion diffusion. Fig. 4(d) shows the Nyquist plots of Co-doped NiO@WCNTF before and after cycling test. After 2000 cycles, the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode still possesses small semicircles at the high frequency region, short Warburg–region at the middle frequency and vertical lines at the low-frequency range, showing fast electron/ion kinetics of electrode. Besides the slight increase of intrinsic ohmic resistance (R s) and decrease of charge-transfer resistance (R ct) after cycling tests, the Nyquist plots before and after cycling are almost the same, indicating high electrochemical stability of the Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode. These EIS results again confirm the superior electrochemical properties of high-loading Co-doped NiO@WCNTF electrode, such as rapid electron/ion transportation and facile diffusion capability. 4 Conclusions In summary, a high-loading Co-doped NiO@WCNTF with interconnected conductive network and open channels were successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal route followed by a high-temperature annealing process. The cross-linked Co-doped NiO nanosheets are uniformly anchored on the interconnected WCNTF, directly severing as freestanding electrode for supercapacitors. The electron transportation in electrode is greatly promoted by the Co-doping and conductive WCNTF support. Benefited from the rational-design architecture with fast charge transport, the unique electrode with high mass-loading of active material (9.2 mg/cm2) exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 11.45 F/cm2 (1244 F/g) at 5 mA/cm2, outstanding rate capability (11.45 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2 and a capacitance retention of 86.2% at 30 mA/cm2) and good cycling stability. This integrated electrode can be extended to other high–performance energy storage systems that involve fast charge transport, such as lithium sulfur batteries and catalysis.

        "dc:description": "Developing high power and energy supercapacitors (SCs) is a long-pursued goal for the application in transportation and energy storage station. Herein, a rationally-designed Co-doped nickel oxide nanosheets@carbon-welded carbon nanotube foam (Co-doped NiO@WCNTF) as freestanding electrode is successfully prepared for high power and energy SCs. The WCNTF framework with high specific surface area provides three dimensional highly conductive network for fast charge transport and ensures high loading of active materials (9.2 mg/cm2). Moreover, porous Co-doped NiO nanosheets uniformly anchored on the WCNTF framework enable rapid charge kinetics due to the high intrinsic conductivity of Co-doped NiO nanosheets and their good contact with conductive WCNTF substrate. As a result, the unique integrated electrode with 3D architecture exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 11.45 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2, outstanding rate capability (11.45 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2 and a capacitance retention of 86.2% at 30 mA/cm2) and good cycling stability, suggesting great potential for high performance supercapacitor.",
