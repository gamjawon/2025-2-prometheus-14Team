MARCINIEC and W. URBANIAK Department of Physical Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, A. Mickiewicz University, Grunwaldzka 6, 60-780 Poznan (Poland) (Received March 9, 1982) Summary Novel supports for heterogenizing metal complexes formed by grafting organosilyl and organosiloxanyl radicals onto mineral silicate (chrysotile asbestos) structure have been prepared. The structure of organosiloxanyl ligands is discussed based on elemental analysis, and mass spectrometric fragmentation of the supports. Kinetic and catalytic parameters of Wilkin- son's catalyst attached to such supports for hydrosilylation of 1-hexene characterise their role in molecular catalysis. Introduction A variety of polymeric materials may be prepared from minerals via the route of organosilylation [1]. The basis of the reaction is the acid decomposition of a silicate, usually by hydrochloric acid in a water-isopro- panol mixture (with cation removal) followed by simultaneous reaction of silanol groups with organochlorosilanes or organosiloxanes [2-5] according to the equations: =Si-0- M+-H-^ ^Si-OH+lv^ (1) R3SiCl =Si-OH > =Si-0-SiR3 (2) Both these stages are sensitive to the structure of the mineral. The serpentine asbestos, e.g. chrysotile which has been the subject of extensive studies, belongs to phyllosilicates containing neutral sheets. The latter are composites formed by combining tetrahedral (SiaOg)^\" and octahedral ['M^/0ii/^]y layers. Partial organosilylation of the chrysotile, occurring with simultaneous displacement of Mg24\" ions, causes destruction of the octahedral layer but leaves the tetrahedral one intact [3, 4]. Therefore, *Part VI in the series 'Catalysis of Hydrosilylation'; for Part V see ref. 9. 0304-5102/83/0000-0000/$03.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 50 the product of the reaction retains certain elements of the original silicate structure, namely, its fibrous shape, which provides an additional advantage for its use as a support for complex catalysts. The processes are accompanied by a considerable increase in surface area of the organosiloxy derivative of chrysotile [3]. Bifunctional silanes, e.g. (CI^zSiClz, hydrolyze to diols and subsequently condense to form polysiloxanediols which can react competitively with the mineral, forming polyorganosiloxane chains grafted onto the silicate structure [ 5]. Our work concerns the preparation of such phosphinoorganosiloxane- silicate supports by two methods, and their application for immobilization of transition metal complexes, e.g. Wilkinson's complex, which is a homoge- neous catalyst tested in hydrosilylation of the C=C bond. Experimental Materials Chrysotile asbestos was obtained from Amiante di Balangero (Italy). Chemical analysis (wt.%): SiO^ 41.5; MgO 34.5; CaO 2.3; H^O (weight loss from 20- 1000 C) 13.5; surface area 10 n^/g. 1-Hexene and solvents were dried and redistilled prior to use. Triethoxysilane and RhCl(PPh3)3 were prepared by well-known methods. Methyl-3-chloropropyldichlorosilane (b.p. 186 - 188 C) and dimethyl-3-chloropropylchlorosilane (b.p. 178 - 180 C) were prepared by the addition of methyldichlorosilane (Fluka) and dimethylchlorosilane (Fluka), respectively, to 3-chloro-l-propene in the presence of chloroplatinic acid [6]. Methyl-3-chloropropyldiethoxysilane and dimethyl-3-chloropropylethoxysilane were synthesized by alcoholysis of the above chloro-substituted silanes. (Diethoxymethylsilyl)propyldi- phenylphosphine and (ethoxydimethylsilyl)propyldiphenylphosphine were obtained by treatment of respective 3-chloropropyl-substituted methyl- ethoxysilanes with LiPPh^ prepared in THF [7]. The products were identified as: CH3(C2HsO)2SiCH2CH2CH2PPh2. Yield: 65-70%, b.p. 145-150 C (4 mmHg), H1 NMR (CCL,, o ppm): CH3Si 0.10 s, 3H; CH3 1.15 t, 6H; CH20 3.55 q, 4H; CeHg 7.10 - 7.70 m, 10H. (CH3)2(C2HsO)SiCH2CH2CH2PPh2 Yield: 60 - 70%, b.p. 125 - 130 C (4 mmHg); H1 NMR (CCLi, o ppm): CH3Si 0.10 s, 6H; CH3 1.20 t, 3H; CH20 3.60 q, 2H; CssHs 7.10 - 7.50 m, 10H. No 3-chloropropyl-substituted silanes were detected by GLC in the above phosphines. Preparation of supports Support S^ 12 g of chrysotile were added to a hydrochloric acid (100 ml, d = 1.18 g/cm^-isopropanol (120 ml) mixture, and subsequently 15 ml of (CH3)2- ClSi(CH2)3Cl were added dropwise. The mixture was refluxed for 12 h with 51 continuous stirring. After the reaction completion, the solid was filtered off, extracted with benzene and washed with methanoi in a Soxhiet appara- tus and dried in vacuo. The chloro-substituted organosiloxy-silicate (8 g) in THF suspension (80 ml) was treated with LiPPh^ added in THF solution under dry nitrogen according to well-known method [7]. The phosphinated support was washed with benzene and methanoi in a Soxhiet apparatus and dried in vacuo. Support SA Support SA was prepared according to an analogous procedure to that given for the support SA , by adding 15 ml of CH3Cl2Si(CH2)3Cl instead of (CH3)2ClSi(CH2)3Cl to the reaction mixture. The 3-chloropropylmethyl- siloxy derivative of chrysotile was also phosphinated with LiPPh2 in order to obtain the support SA . Support SB 3 g chrysotile were added to a mixture of acetone (70 ml) and glacial acetic acid (30 ml) and refluxed for 1.5 h with continuous stirring. Subse- quently, 5 ml of (CH3)2(C2HsO)Si(CH2)3PPh2 and 1 ml of H^O were added and refluxed for 10.5 h. After the reaction was complete, the support was filtered off and extracted with acetone in a Soxhiet apparatus and dried in vacuo. Support SB Support SB was obtained according to the procedure described for support SB by adding 5 ml of CH3(C2HsO)2Si(CH2)3PPh2 instead of ((^3)2- (C2HsO)Si('CH2)3PPh2 to the reaction mixture. After 12 h refluxing, 0.3 ml of concentrated H2S04 was added to the mixture to catalyze the poly- merization of the cyclosiloxanes formed. The mixture was then refluxed for 12 h. The support Sg was filtered and washed in the same way as the support SB . All analytical data on the supports used are summarized in Table 1. Surface areas of the supports were determined by the thermal desorption method [14] using nitrogen as adsorbate. Preparation of supported Rh(I) catalysts RhCl(PPh3)3 (1 g, 11 mmol) was dissolved in benzene (100 ml) and the solution was added to phosphinated organosilicates (3 g of SA and Sa). The mixture was then stirred at room temperature under dry nitrogen for 24 h, extracted with benzene for 6 h in a Soxhiet apparatus (also under nitrogen) and dried in vacuo for 24 h. This resulted in supported catalysts Ai, A2, BI and 82. Hydrosilylation tests Typical experiments were carried out in glass ampoules sealed under nitrogen and containing equimolar amounts of 1-hexene (10 mmol) and 52 TABLE 1 Elemental analysis of supports Supports c H Cl Mg P Specific (%) (%) (%) (%) (%) (n^/g) S SA,SB,SA, 3.62O.I?131.355.57 8.84h 1.26 I.SO111.341.55 2.44b 2.89 4.56b2.16 5.73b 20.3 5.5a6.6b18.58.5*' 0,310.35 0.62 1045a3213 30 1.46 1.49 18.2 0.54 11 S = chrysotile.

Electron impact mass spectra of organosiloxy derivatives were obtained by means of a double focussing mass spectrometer, JEOL model JMS D 100. Operating conditions were: ion-accelerating voltage source pressure 10~6 torr, ionizing voltage 75 eV. Other physico-chemical as well as analytical data were determined by previously reported [9] or commonly employed methods. Results and discussion The treatment of chrysotile asbestos by two 3-chloropropyl derivatives of methylchlorosilanes in the presence of hydrochloric acid (method A) provides two different types of silicate-siloxane supports. Organosilylation of the mineral by monofunctional 3-chloropropyldimethylchlorosilanes approaches the level of 68% (after Mg removal), but the reaction product (SA ) is insoluble in water and organic solvents. The reason for the insolubil- ity is that the silicon-oxygen skeleton does not collapse, even though the morphology of the fibre is destroyed [3]. We have observed that the hydrochloric acid treatment is accompanied by a 4 to 5-fold increase in the surface area of the treated chrysotile which, however, still remains a macro- porous support. The use of a bifunctional reagent such as 3-chloropropylmethyldi- chlorosilane enables disilanols to condense, which results in the formation of polymethyl-3-chloropropylsiloxanediols. As a result, polyorganosiloxane chains become grafted onto the basic silicate structure. However, since a bifunctional silylation reagent which forms polymeric species in solution 53 is used, the product (SA ) is a polysiloxanyl rather than a silyi derivative with a lower degree of siloxanylation as compared with the silylation degree using a monofunctional reagent. Prolonged phosphination can lead to depolymerization of the polymer grafted onto silicate (SA ) [10] as well as elimination of propene from chloropropyl substituents (SA ) [11]. Both effects result in lowering the amount of carbon on the supports. An idealized formula of organosiloxane- silicate supports after their phosphination is presented in Scheme l (SA and SA ) based on the analytical data. Chloropropyl groups are not phosphinated satisfactorily by their treatment with LiPPh; in THF, which results in 25% conversion on the support SA and in about 11% conversion on the support SA . 1 <-O-^Si- 0-<-0-SL-OH<0Si. 0-< CH, Sl(CHz)3CL CH3 CM, SitCH^PPh; .CHi x y 81 0: ^ -O SI.--O--SL-O [ f-oL-u [- -oo-^-oHl(CH^lJx l(CH2)ipph^Jy o^ 5, x': y'= 3.1 Scheme I 'BI O', ^ -0-^L-0--SL-0 -O^-OnL^^^Jz Method B was applied to eliminate the chloropropyl substituents at silicon on the supports, and is based on direct treatment of 3-diphenyl- phosphinepropyi derivatives of silanes with chrysotile. Replacement of HC1 in this method by glacial acetic acid (to reduce the C P cleavage) still causes only slight organosilylation SB (organosiloxanylation SB ) of mineral, though it is known that chrysotile possesses such a low resistance to acids that it may also be decomposed by concentrated acetic acid [12]. Nevertheless, the quantity of phosphine introduced onto the support depends not on the method used, but on the functionality of the silanes and is higher for bifunctional silanes. Two formulas for the supports prepared by method B (SB and SB ) are also proposed in Scheme 1. Grafted cationic copolymerization of bifunctional silanes onto chrysotile under the conditions used in our study (particularly in the presence of hydrochloric acid) can also lead to ring closure. The ring is formed from two polysiloxanyl chains, which results in the formation of cyclic organosilicon derivatives of chrysotile of the following type: 54 On the other hand, catalytic ring opening of such derivatives, also occurring via cationic polymerization of cyclosiloxanes, may form polymeric linear chains of various length attached to the chrysotile structure. A complementary study on mass spectrometric fragmentation of the 3-chloropropylmethylsiloxanyl derivatives of chrysotile has given some information on the number of 3-chloropropylmethylsiloxy units present in linear or cyclic siloxanes. Spectra of dimethylsiloxanes are characterized by elimination of methyl groups under electron impact and, as a result, they usually show the base peak corresponding to (M-15)+ [13]. In the case of the 3-chloropropylmethylsiloxy unit, a similar scheme can be upheld, but rearrangements involving chloropropyi groups predominate. It has been suggested that for such chloroorganic substituents, chlorine is transferred to the silicon atom, while the propyi portion gains or loses a hydrogen atom to eliminate (C3Hs)\" or (C^ti^)' fragments as well as a neutral molecule of C^IIQ without hydrogen transfer [13]. Such fragments, particularly m/z 41 and m/z 42 are observed in mass spectra of 3-chloropropylmethylsiloxanyl derivatives attached to the chrysotile surface. The above rearrangement is followed by an elimination of fragments at m/z 434, m/z 340 and m/z 246 as well as at m/z 153, where the first three fragments differ in a [-Si(Cl)- CH3 0] unit (mass of 94). Their elimination under an electron impact is ac- companied by hydrogen transfer from the terminal silanol group of the elim- inated fragment to the siloxy unit attached to the crysotile network. The mass of 153 may, however, correspond to a hydrogenated form as follows: (C^H^Cl 0-Si-OH .il-UM . CH3 All the spectra point to essentially correct isotopic ratios for chlorine atom fragments. It is well known that such chlorine-containing siloxane ions can be readily identified by their characteristic pattern due to the isotopic distribution of naturally abundant chlorine, i.e. 3SCl .3^Cl= 3:1. In con- clusion, we can say that our preliminary mass spectrometric study has shown the presence of four (n = 4) siloxy units in linear or cyclic structures of polysiloxane, attached to the support examined. The supports SA , SA , Sp and SB were used for immobilization of Wilkinson's complex, which results in the formation of heterogenized catalysts Ai, A;, Bi and B^, respectively, tested in hydrosilylation. These materials appeared to be efficient and selective catalysts for the hydro- silylation of 1-hexene by triethoxysilane. The yields of hexyltriethoxysilane measured in the presence of all catalysts examined are summarized in Table 2. The results show a slight effect of phosphine silyl/siloxyl ligands on the reactivity of Wilkinson-type catalysts immobilized on the supports prepared by method A. Even six-fold catalytic action of the catalyst A^ has practically no influence on the yield of the adduct. 55 TABLE 2 Yield of hexyltriethoxysilane Rh(I) catalyst (C;iHsO)3SiH + C4HcCH=CH2 > (CiHaC^SHCH^sCI^ [SiH]: [1-hexene]: [Rh(I)] = 1:1:5 X 10~4 Catalyst Rh P/Rh Yield (%) (%) 80 C, 2 h, neat 120 C, 2 h, neat Ai 0.7 1.5 71 73 A, 0.9 2.3 75(78,76,75) 78(75,73,72) BI 0.3 3.9 - 54 B-t 0.9 2.0 - 74(70,64,60) RhCl(PPh3)3 3.0 74 76 The 2nd, 3rd and 6th runs, respectively, are given in parentheses. However, preparation of the supports by method B gives rise to an increase in the detachment of the support, resulting in an effective decrease in the yield of hexyltriethoxysilane on recovered heterogenized catalysts. Apparently, 3-chloropropyl substituents at silicate silicon, apart from the essential 3-phosphinepropylsiloxanyl ligands, play a significant role in stabilizing the rhodium(I) complex onto the mineral supports; this is con- firmed by previous catalytic data obtained on aminated silica supports [8]. All the data on kinetic measurements carried out in the temperature range of 60 - 85 C are given in Table 3. The calculated activation energies are also included to verify that no change in the reaction mechanism occurs, irrespective of the support used. This is confirmed by the observation of the J?a (14.1 0.6) for the Wilkinson's complex attached as a precursor to the polyorganosilsesquioxane support of the formula [Pih^Cii-^yaiO^/^x [9]. It is worth noting that the highest reaction rate (determined as turnover number) and the shortest induction period are for the supported catalysts prepared via method A, though these parameters are slightly less reliable than the respective ones for original Wilkinson's complex. Kinetic para- meters also prove that chrysotile samples, modified by bifunctional silanes, are more efective supports (SA , SB ) for immobilization of the rhodium(I) complex than those modified by monochloro-substituted silanes (SA SB ) Furthermore, the catalyst Bi is quite inactive under the conditions of the kinetic study (in benzene solvent) up to 85 C. We thus conclude that all kinetic (turnover number, induction period) and catalytic (product yield, stability for detachment of the complex) parameters indicate that the heterogenized catalyst A^ is the most effective one for hydrosilylation, and can be also tested for other processes, e.g. hydrogenation. 56 TABLE 3 Kinetic and activation parameters for the hydrosilylation of 1-hexene by triethoxysilane Temp.
