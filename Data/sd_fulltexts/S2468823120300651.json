Graphical abstract Highly 3D ordered honeycomb-shaped xCuO⋅Mn2O3 (CuO content (x) = 10, 20, and 30 wt%) catalysts with various CuO contents were synthesized by adopting a colloidal crystal template method with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as template, and the as-prepared catalysts were used in oxidation of CO. The catalysts possessed a macro-mesoporous structure. The catalytic performance at low temperatures improved significantly with a rise in CuO content. The light-off temperature (10 % conversion) and the temperature for CO complete conversion were 71 and 98 oC over 30 wt% CuO⋅Mn2O3, respectively. Good stability of the 30 wt% CuO⋅Mn2O3 catalyst was also observed under the dry and wet (in the presence of water vapor) conditions. It is concluded that high catalytic activity of 30 wt.% CuO.Mn2O3 was related to its unique pore structure, high oxygen adspecies concentration, and oxygen vacancy. Keywords Three-dimensionally ordered honeycomb-shaped catalyst CuO-doped Mn2O3 CO oxidation Hydrothermal stability 1 Introduction In the current century, carbon monoxide has been characterized as the unnoticed poison and silent killer due to its affinity to hemoglobin in the blood stream and formation of carboxy-hemoglobin, which can decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood in the case of long-time exposure to CO in a high concentration [1]. Most of CO emissions are mainly from the cold start of vehicles and domestic activities [2]. Recently, low-temperature catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation has gained increasing attention in converting toxic CO to harmless CO2 (2CO + O2 → 2CO2). Although the catalysts containing gold and platinum group metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Ru [3]) show excellent catalytic performance for CO oxidation, their limited availability and high cost make utilization of these noble metals difficult in commercial requests. In recent years, the transition-metal oxides as heterogeneous catalysts have received more attention [4]. For instance, Co3O4 powder was studied as a potential catalyst for the low-temperature CO oxidation in automotive emission control. Although this metal oxide is catalytically active even at subzero temperatures, it is highly sensitive to trace amounts of moisture [5–10]. X. Xie et al. [5] demonstrated that Co3O4 in the form of nanorods possessed higher catalytic activity, and exhibited high stability in the presence of water; which was related to the high density of catalytically active Co3+ sites exposed on the nanorod surface. Among the transition-metal oxide-based catalysts, a mixture of copper and manganese oxides was the most effective for CO oxidation at low temperatures [11]. Various efforts have been made to increase the performance and stability of such materials at low temperatures and under the conditions containing water vapor [12]. By controlling the preparation processes carefully, one can generate the catalysts with unique structures and morphologies that strongly influence their catalytic properties [3]. For example, Tanaka et al. [13] prepared a Cu-Mn spinel catalyst, and found that the oxidation of CO over this catalyst was completed at 210 °C. Cai et al. [11] pointed out that types of the metal precursor and precipitation agent during the precipitation process could strongly influence catalytic activity of the as-obtained samples. Recently, it has been reported that the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) or honeycomb-shaped catalysts exhibited excellent activity for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and soot due to their low mass transfer limitations [14]. Dai's group successfully used the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-templating procedure to synthesize several types of 3DOM materials, such as Mn2O3 [15], Co3O4 [16], and Al2O3 [17]. They showed that the 3DOM-structured materials performed admirably in the oxidation of VOCs and CO. In the present work, we report for the first time preparation of the 3D ordered honeycomb-shaped CuO⋅Mn2O3 catalysts with various CuO contents and their activity for oxidation of CO at low temperatures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The xCuO⋅Mn2O3 (the Cu content (x) = 10, 20, 30 wt%) catalysts were fabricated using a colloidal crystal template method. The PMMA microspheres were synthesized using the method described in the Supplementary material. In a typical synthesis, appropriate amounts of Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O and Mn(NO3)2⋅4H2O and 1.00 g of P123 (MWaver. = 5800 g/mol) were dissolved in 9 mL of an anhydrous ethylene glycol (EG) and methanol (MeOH) mixed solution (EG/MeOH volumetric ratio = 1/1) under stirring at ambient temperature for 3 h to obtain a transparent solution, in which the molar ratio of metals/P123 was 232. After that, 2.00 g of the PMMA was added into the above obtained mixture solution. After complete soaking of the PMMA microspheres for 3 h, the excess solution was removed via a Buchner funnel connected to a vacuum. Then, the prepared wet PMMA template was dried in air at ambient temperature for 12 h, and the dried sample was put in a ceramic boat in a tubular furnace for calcination at a ramp rate of 1 °C/min in N2 atmosphere at 300 °C for 3 h. After calcination, the sample was cooled to ambient temperature and purged with an air stream (50 mL/min), and the obtained solid was heated to 350 °C and maintained at this temperature for 4 h to convert the partially solidified metal precursors to the xCuO⋅Mn2O3 catalysts. 2.2 Characterization Physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were determined by adopting the N2 adsorption–desorption (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed desorption of O2 (O2-TPD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The details of the characterization methods were mentioned in the Supplementary material. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic performance was calculated at atmospheric pressure using a continuous fixed-bed quartz microreactor (i.d. = 0.8 cm). 25 mg of the sample (25–50 mesh) diluted with 75 mg of quartz sand was loaded in the middle of the microreactor. The flow rate of the reactant mixture (Ar : CO : O2 = 72 : 8 : 20 in volumetric ratio) was 25 mL/min corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 mL/(g h). The reaction was performed in the range of 50–140 °C and the compositions of the reactants and products were determined using Varian 3400 gas chromatograph. Prior to catalytic tests, each sample was oxidized in 20 vol% O2 in Ar (25 mL/min) at 300 °C for 1 h. 3 Results and discussion Figs. 1 and 2 show SEM and TEM images of the ordered porous xCuO⋅Mn2O3 samples, respectively. It is seen that all of the samples calcined at 350 oC exhibited a honeycomb-shaped architecture. In the honeycomb space, an “inverse opal” structure was formed with the interconnected walls and well-ordered macropores, and the below layers were clearly observable in the SEM pictures. The pore sizes of as-prepared samples were 180 ± 10 nm, much smaller than the size (ca. 250 nm) of the PMMA microspheres (Fig. 1A and B). The decrease in average pore size was generally because of shrinkage of the sintering and polymeric microspheres during the calcination process. The wall thickness was 10 ± 2 nm, approximating to the crystallite sizes calculated from the XRD results (Table 1S), which confirms that the walls were composed of crystallites. This structure lets the gas molecules to go in the inner pores without any resistance and provides a better prospect for gas molecules to reach the active sites, thus accelerating the oxidation of reactants [18,19]. Fig. 2 shows the high-resolution TEM images of the as-obtained ordered porous 20CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample. Well-resolved lattice fringes could be observed, indicating that this sample possessed a high crystallinity. The interplanar spacings (d values) were estimated to be 0.25 and 0.48 nm, which were in good agreement with those of the (112) and (011) crystal planes of the standard CuMn2O4 sample, respectively [20,21]. Fig. 1S.A illustrates the pore-size distributions of the samples. It is apparent that each sample showed two distribution peaks in the ranges of 4–9 and 10–64 nm, respectively, indicating existence of both meso- and macropores within the structure, which was also confirmed by the SEM and HRTEM observations (Figs. 1 and 2). As can be seen, the increment in Cu content shifted the pore-size distribution to smaller size and also led to a decrease in intensity of the peaks indicating the plugging of pores by the CuO entities [22]. Each sample showed a IV-typed N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (inset of Fig. 1S.A) with a H3 type hysteresis loop, indicating formation of a structure in a mesoporous state with cylindrical and parallel channels in the sample. The H3 type hysteresis loop was observed at a high relative pressure (p/p 0) of 0.8–1.0, indicating presence of large mesopores in the samples as reported in Table 1S. It is concluded that the rise in CuO content declined the BET surface area, and the 10CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample possessed the highest surface area (43.2 m2/g). The decrease in surface area with increasing the CuO content was related to the filling of the pores by the CuO particles. That is to say, the copper oxide particles acted as pore blocker at a higher content [20]. XRD patterns of the obtained samples with various CuO contents are presented in Fig. 1S.B. The results indicate that the as-prepared samples possessed a high degree of crystallinity. The sharp and strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 18.6°, 30.4°, 35.9°, 43.7°, 57.8°, and 63.5° confirm formation of the spinel CuMn2O4 phase. These diffraction peaks could be well indexed to the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CuMn2O4 (JCPDS PDF# 74–1921, space group: Fd-3m, a = 0.833 nm) with a spinel structure. In addition, the Mn3O4 phase was also detected in the XRD patterns of the samples, and the increment in CuO content increased the fraction of the CuMn2O4 phase. The results indicate that the rise in CuO content from 10 to 30 wt% intensified the diffraction peaks assignable to the spinel CuMn2O4 phase, which confirms the increase in crystallite size from 8.3 to 11.6 nm of the CuMn2O4 (Table 1S). H2-TPR profiles of the samples are shown in Fig. 2S.A. One main reduction peak with a small shoulder was observed in the TPR profile of the samples with various CuO contents. The shoulder at a temperature lower than 200 °C could be ascribed to reduction of the CuO. The main peak at a higher temperature was attributed to reduction of CuO in the spinel lattice and reduction of Mn2O3 to MnO via Mn3O4. During the reduction process, the CuMn2O4 nanocrystallite was converted to MnO and metallic copper, resulting in a partially overlapped pattern. In addition, Fig. 2S.B illustrates the initial H2 consumption rate vs. inverse temperature of the samples, which was more operative in estimating the low-temperature reducibility of the samples. It is evident that at a constant temperature, the 10CuO⋅Mn2O3 showed the lowest initial H2 consumption rate and the initial H2 consumption rate increased with increasing the CuO content. To investigate the interaction between the adsorbed oxygen species and xCuO.Mn2O3 surface, O2-TPD experiments were carried out over the samples with various CuO contents. In Fig. 3 S, there was an obvious desorption peak at around 330 °C on the all samples, which could be assigned to the desorption of surface oxygen species adsorbed on oxygen vacancy. The shift of O2 desorption peak to lower temperature with increasing of CuO loading indicated that the adsorbed oxygen on 30CuO.Mn2O3 was more easily desorbed, which confirmed that the activation of surface adsorbed oxygen was promoted. Meanwhile, the amount of O2 desorption by 30CuO.Mn2O3 was higher than that of 10CuO.Mn2O3 and 20CuO.Mn2O3, which indicated that the increasing in CuO content facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancy. Surface compositions of the xCuO⋅Mn2O3 samples were examined by the XPS system, which is essential to determine the states of the active species. The O 1s, Cu 2p, and Mn 2p spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 S, and Table 2S summarizes their surface element compositions. Concerning the O 1s spectra (Fig. 3A), three peaks were basically detected for all of the samples at binding energy (BE) = 529.7, 531.4, and 533.0 eV, which were related to the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt), chemisorbed oxygen (Oads), and adsorbed hydroxyls or carbonates, respectively [23]. Simultaneously, as seen from Table 2S, the Oads/(Oads + Olatt) molar ratio (0.68) on the 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample was the highest, which confirms that a catalyst with a higher concentration of adsorbed oxygen species was more favorable in the oxidation reactions [24]. The Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 3B) of each sample reveals presence of the Cu 2p signals (Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2) as well as satellite peaks, representing that the copper in the samples existed in the form of Cu2+ [25].The main difference among these spectra was intensity of the peak at BE =932.0 eV, which could be related to the surface Cu+ species in the tetrahedral position of the spinel [26]. This observation was in accordance with the XRD results (Fig. 1S.B), which indicate that the increase in CuO content intensified the diffraction peaks related to the spinel CuMn2O4 phase. Two different XPS peaks of Mn 2p (Fig. 4S) reveal the appearance of Mn3+ in CuMn2O4, and an energy gap of 11.9 eV between peaks at BE = 641.4 (Mn 2p3/2) and BE =653.3 eV (Mn 2p1/2) was in compliance with the standard Mn 2p spectrum of Mn3+ [21]. Catalytic activities of the as-fabricated samples for CO oxidation are displayed in Fig. 4, and the corresponding temperatures (T 10, T 50, and T 90) at 10, 50, and 90 % CO conversions are reported in Table 2S, respectively. It is seen that catalytic activity of the sample was closely related to the content of CuO, and the activity increased in the following order: 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 > 20CuO⋅Mn2O3 > 10CuO⋅Mn2O3. Based on the H2-TPR, XRD, and XPS results, enhanced performance of the sample was related to its improved low-temperature reducibility and adsorbed oxygen species concentration. For better comparison, the catalytic activities of some catalysts are summarized in Table 3S. Apparently, the activity of 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 (T 50 = 84 °C) was higher than those observed over 10 % Mn/CeO2 (T 50 = 160 °C) [28] and CoMg30 (T 50 = 250 °C) [29]. The results showed almost similar catalytic activity for this catalyst compared to those observed over Mn-Cu (T 50 = 59 °C) [3], CuMnCe (T 50 = 85 °C) [27], and CuO.Fe2O3 (T 50 = 60 °C) [30]. For example, Choi et al. [3] investigated the Mn―Cu―M (M = Ce, Co, Cr, and Fe) catalysts for CO oxidation, and observed that the Mn-Cu(0.1) catalyst synthesized with the optimal Cu/Mn molar ratio of 0.1 achieved the complete CO conversion at 100 °C. Dey et al. [27] reported that the complete oxidation of CO over the copper-based mixed oxide (CuMnCe, CuMnCo, and CuCeZr) catalysts prepared with a co-precipitation route was achieved at temperatures above 100 °C. Obviously, our results obtained over the 3D honeycomb-shaped porous xCuO⋅Mn2O3 samples were comparable with those previously reported in the literature. Fig. 4B shows the Arrhenius plots for the oxidation of CO in the temperature range of 50–90 oC, in which CO conversions were lower than 20 % over the as-prepared honeycomb-shaped porous xCuO⋅Mn2O3 samples. Accordingly, the apparent activation energies (E a) of CO oxidation over 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 (71.6 kJ/mol) was lower than those over 20CuO⋅Mn2O3 (87.0 kJ/mol) and 10CuO⋅Mn2O3 (87.5 kJ/mol). The difference in E a of the samples was associated with the CuO content. In the Table 2 s, the results of TOFCuO (S−1) are also summarized which calculated based on the gram of CuO in different Cu-doped samples (Reaction condition: 2 vol% CO+5 vol% O2+ Ar (balance), GHSV = 60,000 mL/(g h) at 80 °C) according to the reported method [22]. The effect of water vapour on catalytic activity for CO oxidation of the 20CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample was studied by introducing 4.0 vol% H2O to the reaction system at 110 oC and the results are shown in Fig. 5 A. For better comparison, the stability under the dry condition is also shown in this figure. It can be seen that CO conversion dropped by ca. 7 % after addition of moisture to the feed stream. However, the catalytic stability remained stable during 10 h of on-stream reaction, and after water vapour was cut off from the feed stream the activity was restored to its initial value. The results indicate good stability of the sample without any decline in catalytic activity. The influences of GHSV (Fig. 5B) and CO/O2 molar ratio (Fig. 5C) on catalytic activity of the 20CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample at 90 °C were also examined. The results reveal that the increment in GHSV from 30,000 to 90,000 mL/(g h) decreased CO conversion, a result possibly due to the shortening of the residence time and the decrease in amount of the adsorbed reactants [14]. Meanwhile, catalytic activity was not significantly affected by increasing CO/O2 molar ratio. The stoichiometric ratio of the O2 : CO in CO oxidation is 0.5 and presence of the excess oxygen in the reaction caused no decline in CO conversion [31]. 4 Conclusion The 3D ordered honeycomb-shaped porous xCuO⋅Mn2O3 catalysts with various CuO contents were prepared using a colloidal crystal template method. The XRD analysis results confirm presence of the spinel CuMn2O4 phase in the samples. Among them, the CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample with a CuO content of 30 wt% possessed the highest catalytic activity in the oxidation of carbon monoxide. The light-off temperature over 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 was 71 oC, which was much lower than those over 10CuO⋅Mn2O3 and 20CuO⋅Mn2O3. CO could be completely oxidized at 98 oC over the 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample with excellent stability. Besides, with the addition of 4 vol% water vapor to the feed stream, catalytic activity decreased only slightly during 10 h of on-stream reaction, and after water vapor was cut off the activity was restored. The results indicate that the 3D ordered honeycomb-shaped porous 30CuO⋅Mn2O3 sample possessed more oxygen vacancy and high oxygen adspecies concentration, which led to higher performance in CO oxidation reaction.

The catalysts possessed a macro-mesoporous structure. The catalytic performance at low temperatures improved significantly with a rise in CuO content. The light-off temperature (10 % conversion) and the temperature for CO complete conversion were 71 and 98 oC over 30 wt% CuO⋅Mn2O3, respectively. Good stability of the 30 wt% CuO⋅Mn2O3 catalyst was also observed under the dry and wet (in the presence of water vapor) conditions. It is concluded that high catalytic activity of 30 wt.% CuO.Mn2O3 was related to its unique pore structure, high oxygen adspecies concentration, and oxygen vacancy.",
