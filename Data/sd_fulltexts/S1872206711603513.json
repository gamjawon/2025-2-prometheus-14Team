DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60351-3 ARTICLE Selective Hydrogenation of Benzene to Cyclohexene over a Ru-Zn catalyst with Diethanolamine as an Additive SUN Haijie, PAN Yajie, WANG Hongxia, DONG Yingying, LIU Zhongyi*, LIU Shouchang Department of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China Abstract: A Ru-Zn catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation, and the effect of adding diethanolamine on benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene was investigated. The catalyst was characterized by N 2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Diethanolamine reacted with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 and diethanolamine sulfate. The amount of (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 adsorbed on the catalyst surface increased with increasing diethanolamine amount. The synergism of (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 and diethanolamine sulfate improved the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst. With a diethanolamine dosage of 0.3 g, (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 was highly dispersed on catalyst surface and the sample after hydrogenation was characterized. This catalyst exhibited the best performance with a cyclohexene selectivity and yield of 75.5% and 63.6%, respectively, at the benzene conversion of 84.3% in the third run. Moreover, the benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were stable above 75% and cyclohexene yield was above 58% in the fourth run. Key words: diethanolamine; ruthenium; zinc; benzene; selective hydrogenation; cyclohexene The production of nylon-6 and nylon-66 from benzene and cyclohexene has attracted much attention for its atomic economy, mild reaction condition, and energy saving, and it is environmentally benign and is superior to the use of benzene and cyclohexane [1â€“3]. However, thermodynamics make it difficult to get cyclohexene from benzene hydrogenation be- cause the standard free energy change for cyclohexene forma- tion from benzene hydrogenation is â€“23 kJ/mol, while that for cyclohexane formation is â€“98 kJ/mol [1]. Hence, developing a catalyst with high selectivity to cyclohexene from benzene selective hydrogenation is the key in this technology. The hydrophilic modification of the catalyst surface with promoters or additives is an effective method to improve the cyclohexene selectivity of a Ru-based catalyst. In 1989, Asahi Chemical Industry Co. industrialized the process for producing cyclohexene from benzene selective hydrogenation by em- ploying an unsupported Ru-Zn catalyst and obtained a cyclo- hexene yield of 32% at a benzene conversion of 40% [4,5]. Liu et al. [6] prepared a Ce-promoted Ru/SBA-15 catalyst by a ?two solvents? impregnation method and achieved a cyclo- hexene yield of 53.8% over the Ru-Ce/SBA-15 catalyst with a Ce/Ru molar ratio of 0.25 in the presence of ZnSO 4 (0.42 mol/L). They achieved a cyclohexene yield of 57% and a se- lectivity of 69% at the benzene conversion of 82% over a Ru-La/SBA catalyst with CdSO 4 and ZnSO 4 as co-modifiers [7]. Liu et al. [8] carried out the reaction over a Ru-Cu/ZnO catalyst with the Ru/Cu ratio of 10:1 in 2 ml of 0.3 mol/L NaOH solution and obtained a maximum cyclohexene yield of 49.4% at a benzene conversion of 72.3% and a cyclohexene selectivity of 68.3%. Although the cyclohexene yields over these promising catalysts were higher than that of the industrial catalyst, the corresponding selectivity for cyclohexene was lower than 70%, while a selectivity for cyclohexene close to 80% is required for industrial use to reduce the difficulties in subsequent product (including benzene, cyclohexene, and cyclohexane) separation. In a previous work, we prepared a monolayer dispersed Ru-Zn catalyst and achieved a cyclohexene selectivity of 69.8% at a benzene conversion of 84.8% at 10 min reaction time [2]. In addition, we doped the Ru catalyst with Mn and Zn as co-promoters and obtained a cyclohexene selectivity of 81.1% at a benzene conversion of 60.2% at 20 min reaction SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 610â€“620 time over the Ru-Mn-Zn catalyst with the Mn/Zn ratio of 0.3 and the addition of 0.5 g NaOH. A maximum cyclohexene yield of 59.9% was also achieved at 20 min [10]. We also briefly reported cyclohexene yields of 61.4% and 58.9%, re- spectively, with PEG-20000 and diethanolamine as additives on a Ru-Zn catalyst [3]. In this work, the influence of the di- ethanolamine doses on the performance of the Ru-Zn catalyst for benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene was in- vestigated in the presence of ZnSO 4 . The catalyst before and after hydrogenation was characterized and the role of dietha- nolamine is discussed. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ru-Zn catalysts were prepared according to the proce- dure in the literature [11]. The required amounts of RuCl 3 Â·H 2 O and ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O were dissolved in 200 ml H 2 O with agitation. To the stirred solution, 200 ml of 30% NaOH solution was added rapidly and the resulting mixture was agitated for an additional 4 h at 80 o C. The mixture was left to stand and the black precipitate obtained was washed three times with an aqueous solution of 5% NaOH after the supernatant had been removed by decantation. This black precipitate was dispersed in 400 ml of 5% NaOH solution and charged into a 1 L auto- clave lined with Teflon. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave to a pressure of 5 MPa and the reduction was con- ducted at 150 o C and 800 r/min stirring for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and the black powder obtained was washed three times with 5% NaOH and then with water until neutral, and the desired Ru-Zn catalyst was obtained. The amounts of ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O were adjusted to give the desired Zn loadings. The catalysts with different Zn loadings were denoted Ru-Zn(x), where x is the Zn loading determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). 1.2 Catalyst characterization AAS for determining the Zn loading was performed on a Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 300 instrument operated at = 213.9 nm and slit width = 0.20 nm. N 2 physisorption (BET) was determined on a Quantachrome Nova 100e apparatus. Trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a PANalytcal X Pert PRO instrument using Cu K ( = 0.1541 nm) in a scan range of 5 o â€“90 o at a scan step of 0.03 o . The elemental analysis was measured by X-ray fluo- rescence (XRF) on a Bruk S4 Pioneer instrument. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a KBr pellet on a Thero Nicolet Nexus-470 spectrophotometer. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was carried out on a homemade microreactor with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The flow rate of 5% H 2 -95% N 2 was 30 ml/min and the heating rate was 10 o C/min. 1.3 Catalyst test The selective hydrogenation of benzene was performed in a 1 L autoclave lined the Hastelloy. The autoclave was charged with 280 ml H 2 O containing 1.96 g catalyst, 9.8 g ZrO 2 , 49.2 g ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O, and a desired amount of diethanolamine. This was heated at H 2 pressure of 5 MPa and stirring rate of 800 r/min. Benzene (140 ml) was fed in and the stirring rate was increased to 1400 r/min to exclude diffusional effects when the temperature reached 150 o C. The reaction products were monitored by taking a small amount of the reaction mixture every 5 min for analysis using a GC-1690 gas chromatograph with an FID detector, which purchased from Hangzhou Kexiao Instrument Co. Benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectiv- ity were calculated based on the product concentration calcu- lated using corrected peak area normalization. At the end of the reaction, the organic phase was removed using a separator funnel. The slurry containing the mixture of the catalyst and ZrO 2 was reused using the above operation without any addi- tion. After the reaction, the organic liquid was removed and the solid sample was washed for characterization. The samples after reaction and recycle were denoted Ru-Zn(x)-y and Ru-Zn(x)-R, respectively, where y and R represent the mass of diethanolamine and recycle time, respectively. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization 2.1.1 N 2 physisorption Table 1 shows the textural properties of ZrO2, Ru-Zn cata- lyst, and the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst with different diethanola- mine dosages as an additive after hydrogenation.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 610â€“620 pore diameter of 5.74 nm, and pore volume of 0.089 cm 3 /g. The specific surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume of the samples after reaction and recycles were close to those of ZrO 2 , which may be related to the dosage of ZrO 2 (mass ratio of ZrO 2 and catalyst was 5:1). 2.1.2 TEM results Figure 1 gives the TEM images of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and the samples after reaction and recycles using 0.3 g di- ethanolamine as an additive, and the crystallite size distribution of the corresponding catalyst. From Fig. 1, the crystallite size of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst was 3.5 nm. Figure 1 shows that the catalyst particles were separated and isolated. This suggests that a suitable amount of ZrO 2 can remarkably suppress ag- glomeration that could have occurred due to the collision of different particles under high agitation. The added ZrO 2 also reduced catalyst adhesion to the metallic surface of the reactor [12]. In addition, a suitable amount of ZrO 2 improved the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [13]. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the crystallite size of the catalyst after the first hydro- genation run was 3.5 nm, which agrees with that of the fresh catalyst. The crystallite size of the catalyst after five recycles was slightly increased to 3.8 nm. The main component of the Ru-Zn catalyst is metallic Ru, which is difficult to disperse and prone to agglomerate to form bigger particles. The very slight increase of the catalyst size after five recycles confirmed the dispersion effect of ZrO 2 . 2.1.3 XRD results Figure 2 shows XRD patterns of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and the catalyst after hydrogenation with different dietha- nolamine dosages as additives. The reflections at 2 = 38.4 o , 42.4 o , 43.9 o , 58.3 o , 69.3 o , and 78.3 o were assigned to metallic Ru (JCPDS 01-070-0274). Sun et al. [2] has used XRD and XPS to confirm that most of the Zn species in Ru-Zn catalysts exist as ZnO. Part of the Zn in the catalyst was present in the form of metallic Zn. However, no ZnO or metallic Zn diffrac- tions were detected in the XRD patterns, indicating their high dispersion and that their small crystallite size was smaller than the detectable limit of the instrument. When the diethanola- mine dosage was increased from 0 to 0.3 g, besides the weak diffraction at 2 = 43.9 o from the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst after hydrogenation due to metallic Ru (JCPDS 01-070-0274), the other diffractions corresponded to the monoclinic phase of ZrO 2 (JCPDS 00-024-1165). When the diethanolamine dosage was 0.4 g, in addition to the diffractions of metallic Ru and ZrO 2 , the diffraction at 2 = 9.8 o from the Ru-Zn(4.9%) cata- lyst after hydrogenation was attributed to the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 phase (JCPDS 01-078-0247). This revealed that the diethanolamine added reacted with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form an insoluble (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt and diethanolamine sulfate. This is shown as reactions (1) and 10 nm Ru-Zn(4.9%) 10 nm ZrO 2 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3-R ZrO 2 ZrO 2 10 nm 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 D i s t r i b u t i o n ( % ) Diameter of crystallite (nm) Ru-Zn(4.9%) 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 Diameter of crystallite (nm) Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 Diameter of crystallite (nm) Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3-R Fig. 1.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 610â€“620 (2): HO N H OH +H 2 O HO N H OH H + +OH - 6OH - + 4Zn 2+ +SO 4 2- + 3H 2 O (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 (1) (2) This also indicated that the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was highly dispersed on the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and ZrO 2 particles when the dosage of diethanolamine was 0.3 g. It was found that the diffraction at 2 = 43.9 o corresponding to me- tallic Ru was remarkably weakened after five recycles, indi- cating a loss of catalyst in the oil phase when this phase was separated from the catalyst during the recycling. It was ob- served that the diffraction at 2 = 9.8 o from the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 phase also appeared with the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst after hydrogenation when the dosage of diethanolamine was 0.3 g. It was reported that part of the Zn species in the Ru-Zn(8.6%) catalyst existed as ZnO and ZnO can react with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form an insoluble ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O salt (JCPDS 00-009-0204), which can be dispersed on catalyst surface to form a monolayer [2]. Di- ethanolamine also can react with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form a (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt, with properties close to those of the ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O salt since their difference is only four water molecules of crystallization. Thus, with the addition of diethanolamine, the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 formed can constitute a phase with the ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O salt on the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst surface. 2.1.4 XRF results Table 2 gives the amounts of the metallic elements of ZrO 2 and the Ru-Zn catalysts before and after hydrogenation with different diethanolamine dosages as additives. The sample after hydrogenation mainly contains four metallic elements, Ru, Zn, Zr and Hf. Hf comes from the ZrO 2 sample that con- tains HfO 2 . The amount of Zn in the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst after hydrogenation increased with increasing diethanolamine dos- ages. XRD confirmed that diethanolamine reacted with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form an insoluble (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt that was easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface. This re- sulted in the increase of the Zn content in the samples. It is to be noted that the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was formed in the hydrogenation process and so can only be dispersed on the catalyst surface. It was found that both Ru and Zn contents decreased after five recycles, which indicated the loss of catalyst in the recycles. This was consistent with the XRD results. The Zn contents in the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst with 0.4 g diethanolamine and the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst with 0.3 g di- ethanolamine after hydrogenation were 6.15% and 6.23%, respectively, which showed the high content of the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt on the catalyst surface. This was in agreement with the XRD results. 2.1.5 FT-IR results Figure 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) cata- 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Ru-Zn(8.4%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-R Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.4 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.2 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0 Ru-Zn(4.9%) (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 Ru I n t e n s i t y 2? /( o ) Fig. 2.

With the increase of dithanolamine dosages, no absorbance from dithanolamine was observed on the catalysts after hydrogena- tion, which indicated that dithanolamine was not adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the dithanolamine existed in the slurry. 2.1.6 H 2 -TPR results Figure 4 gives the H 2 -TPR profiles of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst after hydrogenation with different dithanolamine dosages as additives. All the samples have one reduction peak due to the reduction of RuO x , indicating the oxidation of the most active Ru sites during catalyst washing. With the increase of the dithanolamine dosage, the reduction peak shifted to lower temperatures. However, on further increasing the dithanolamine dosage, the reduction peak shifted back. Al- though the FT-IR spectra revealed that little dithanolamine was adsorbed on the catalyst surface, dithanolamine in the slurry can suppress agglomeration of the catalyst due to a space ef- fect. Therefore, with increasing dithanolamine dosage, the catalyst particles after hydrogenation became smaller, which led to the reduction peak shifting to lower temperatures. However, when the dithanolamine dosage was increased to 0.4 g, too much (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was formed and deposited on the catalyst surface, which made the reduction of RuO x more difficult. It is also found that the temperatures for the full reduction of the samples were all lower than the reac- tion temperature of 150 o C, implying the existence of metallic Ru during the reaction. 2.2 Catalytic performance 2.2.1 Effect of dithanolamine dosages on catalytic activity Figure 5 shows the activity of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst with different dithanolamine dosages as additives. With increasing dithanolamine dosage from 0 to 0.3 g, the activity of the cata- lyst decreased, the cyclohexene selectivity increased for the same benzene conversion, and the maximum yield of cyclo- hexene increased to 59.4% from 55.2% with reaction time. Increasing dithanolamine dosage to 0.4 g, the activity of the catalyst was significantly decreased, but the cyclohexene se- lectivity was slightly increased at the same benzene conversion and the maximum yield of cyclohexene decreased to 41.9%. The Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst exhibited the best performance for benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene at the opti- mum dithanolamine dosage of 0.3 g. As known from the above characterization, dithanolamine can react with ZnSO 4 to form an insoluble (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt. This adsorbed salt changed the composition of the catalyst surface, which is a vital factor in the performance of the catalyst. Based on pre- vious works [7], the insoluble (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 may play four roles as follows. (1) The (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt contains large amounts of Zn 2+ ions. The Zn 2+ ions can form a stable complex with cyclohexene, which can accelerate the desorption of cyclohexene and retard the re-adsorption of 5 10152025 0 20 40 60 80 100 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.2 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.4 B e n z e n e c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Reaction time (min) 20 40 60 80 100 40 50 60 70 80 90 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.2 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.4 C y c l o h e x e n e s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Benzene conversion (%) 5 10152025 10 20 30 40 50 60 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.2 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.3 Ru-Zn(4.9%)-0.4 C y c l o h e x e n e y i e l d ( % ) Reaction time (min) Fig. 5.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 610â€“620 the desorbed cyclohexene [7]. This improved the selectivity for cyclohexene. (2) The (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt adsorbed on the catalyst surface can block active sites unsuitable for the formation of cyclohexene. Struijk et al. [17] suggested that the salt can selectively cover the most reactive sites, which lowers the adsorption enthalpies of benzene. This resulted in an in- crease of the cyclohexene desorption rate, which enhances the selectivity for cyclohexene. (3) The (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt adsorbed on the catalyst surface comprised plentiful water of crystallization, which can enhance the hydrophilicity of the catalyst and improve the selectivity to cyclohexene. (4) An interaction between the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt and the active Ru component can modify the electronic structure of Ru, which makes the Ru catalyst more suitable for benzene selec- tive hydrogenation to cyclohexene [2]. Therefore, with the increase of dithanolamine dosage, the amount of the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt increased, resulting in the in- crease of the activity and the decrease of the selectivity for cyclohexene. When the dithanolamine dosage was 0.3 g, the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was highly dispersed on the surface of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and the catalyst exhibited good activity and excellent selectivity for cyclohexene. FT-IR confirmed that little dithanolamine was adsorbed on the cata- lyst surface. The isolated electron pair of O (or N) of ditha- nolamine sulfate can form a hydrogen bond, which can sig- nificantly stabilize cyclohexene and reduce the re-adsorption of desorbed cyclohexene onto the catalyst and its further hydro- genation from cyclohexene to cyclohexane [18]. Thus the synergism of (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 and diethanolamine sulfate improved the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru-Zn catalyst. 2.2.2 Effect of Zn content on catalytic performance With 0.3 g dithanolamine, the effect of the Zn content on the performance of the Ru-Zn catalysts was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Both the activity and cyclohexene yield of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst were higher than the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst, but the selectivity of the latter was higher although by less than 2%. Obviously, the performance of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst was superior to that of the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst. With the addition of 0.3 g dithanola- mine, the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt agglomerated on the Ru-Zn(8.4%) catalyst, which led to a decrease of the activity of the catalyst and a slight increase of the selectivity for cyclo- hexene. When the dithanolamine dosage was 0.3 g, the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was highly dispersed on the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and this catalyst gave the best perform- ance for benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene. A selectivity for cyclohexene of 78.9% and a yield of 56.3% at a benzene conversion of 71.3% were obtained at 20 min reaction time under this condition. This not only meets the industrial requirement but also exceeds those of the industrial catalyst [5,9]. In addition, this also confirmed that the optimum Zn content of the Ru-Zn catalyst is closely related to the kind of additives. 2.2.3 Catalyst stability Figure 7 shows the performance of Ru-Zn(4.9%) during five recycles with 0.3 g dithanolamine as an additive. Benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were stable above 75% and cyclohexene yields were kept above 58% over the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst in first four recycles. This demonstrated the good activity and selectivity as well as the excellent sta- bility of the catalyst. However, the benzene conversion, cyclohexene selectivity, and yield decreased to 59.8%, 80.4%, and 48.1% in the fifth recycle, respectively. XRD and XRF results revealed that the decrease was caused by the loss of the catalyst in the recycling. It is worth noting that the benzene conversion, cyclohexene selectivity, and cyclohexene yield reached 84.3%, 75.5%, and 63.6%, respectively, which is better 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 76 80 84 88 92 5 10152025 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Ru-Zn(4.9%) Ru-Zn(8.4%) B e n z e n e c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Reaction time (min) Ru-Zn(4.9%) Ru-Zn(8.4%) C y c l o h e x e n e s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Benzene conversion (%) 5 10152025 10 20 30 40 50 60 Ru-Zn(4.9%) Ru-Zn(8.4%) C y c l o h e x e n e y i e l d ( % ) Reaction time (min) Fig. 6.

The synergism of the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt and di- ethanolamine sulfate improved the selectivity to cyclohexene of the Ru-based catalyst. When the diethanolamine dosage was 0.3 g, the (Zn(OH) 2 ) 3 (ZnSO 4 )(H 2 O) 3 salt was highly dispersed on the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst and the ZrO 2 particles and the catalyst exhibited excellent selectivity to cyclohexene and good stability. The optimum Zn content of the Ru-Zn catalyst depended on the concentration of ZnSO 4 in the slurry and also the kind of additives.
