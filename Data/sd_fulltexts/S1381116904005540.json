Oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene over a SrO-promoted Er2O3 supported on low-surface area macroporous silica–alumina commercial catalyst carrier (SA5205, obtained from Norton Co., USA) in presence of steam (steam/C2H6 mole ratio = 1.0) and limited O2 (C2H6/O2 mole ratio ≥ 4.0) has been thoroughly investigated. Influence of different process parameters such as temperature (700–850°C), C2H6/O2 feed ratio (4.0–8.0) and space velocity (50, 000–200, 000cm3 g−1 h−1) on the conversion of ethane and product selectivity in the process has been studied.

Keywords Ethane Ethylene Oxidative dehydrogenation SrO-promoted Er2O3 1 Introduction Oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene in presence of catalyst is futuristic process of great practical importance. Ethylene is a keystone to petrochemical industry, and is produced commercially from ethane, ethane–propane mixture or naphtha by their thermal cracking in the presence of steam [1]. However, this conventional process is highly endothermic, energy intensive and also involves extensive coke formation. The large amount of coke deposits on the inner walls of tubular cracking reactor because of which the heat transfer from the reactor walls is reduced, requiring higher wall temperature (upto 1100°C). This consequently requires more energy, reduces the life of reactor tubes and also needs the process shutdown for physical removal of the coke. In order to overcome these problems associated with conventional process, worldwide efforts have been made by many for oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene, using alkali metal-containing catalysts [2–8] and alkaline earth metal-promoted La2O3 [9–12] or other rare earth oxide [13] catalysts. The alkali metal-containing catalysts have poor thermal/hydrothermal stability because of the presence of low melting or volatile active components. However, alkaline earth-metal promoted catalysts have no such problem. Since oxidative conversion of ethane is exothermic and also involves formation of water, there is a need to develop a catalyst, which not only is active and selective but also has high thermal and hydrothermal stability. High mechanical strength is a basic requirement of any commercial catalyst. This could be achieved by supporting the catalyst on a porous catalyst carrier having high mechanical strength and high thermal/hydrothermal stability. In this investigation a supported SrO-promoted Er2O3 catalyst satisfying the above requirements and also operating at very low contact time in the process has been reported. 2 Experimental The supported catalyst [SrO (11.6wt.%)/Er2O3 (15.6wt.%)/SA-5205] was prepared by impregnating a commercial catalyst support SA-5205 (obtained from Norton Co., USA), crushed to 22–30 mesh size particles, first by erbium nitrate (GR LOBA) and then with strontium nitrate (extra pure, LOBA) by using the incipient wetness technique [14]. After each impregnation, the resulting particles were dried at 90 °C for 16h and then calcined in static air at 900°C for 4h. SA-5205 is an inert macro-porous (porosity: 50%) catalyst carrier, having a low-surface area (<0.01m2 g−1) and it consists mainly of Al2O3 (86.1wt.%) and SiO2 (11.8wt.%). The oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene reaction was carried out over the catalyst at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow quartz tubular reactor having low dead volume, described elsewhere [15], at different temperatures (700–850°C), C2H6/O2 feed ratios (4.0–8.0) and gas hourly space velocities (50,000–200, 000cm3 g−1 h−1) in the presence of steam (steam/C2H6 mole ratio = 1.0). The feed consisted of mixture of pure ethane, oxygen and steam; no feed diluent was used. The space velocity was calculated at 0°C and one atmosphere pressure. The reaction temperature was measured by a Chromel–Alumel thermocouple located in the catalyst bed. The reactor effluent gases, after the removal of water by condensation at 0°C were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph with TCD detectors using Poropak-Q and Spherocarb columns. The selectivity for C2H4 and C2+ olefins is defined as: Selectivity for C2H4 and C2+ olefins (%) = (mole of ethane converted to ethylene and other olefins /moles of ethane converted to all the products) × 100. 3 Results and discussion Results showing the effect of various process parameters such as temperature (700–850°C), C2H6/O2 feed ratio (4.0–8.0) and space velocity (GHSV = 50,000–200, 000cm3g−1 h−1) on the conversion of ethane and oxygen, product selectivity (for C2H4, C2+ olefins, C3+ paraffins, CH4 and CO x ) and CO/CO2 product ratio in the process are presented in Figs. 1–3. No coke deposition was observed on the catalyst for all the process conditions. 3.1 Influence of temperature The results in Fig. 1 show a strong influence of temperature on the conversion of C2H6 and O2, selectivity for C2H4, C2+ olefins, CH4, C3+ paraffins, CO x and the CO/CO2 product ratio, as follows. With the increase in the reaction temperature: – the conversion of C2H6 and O2 is increased as expected. – the selectivity for C2H4, C2+ olefins and CH4 is increased, however, the selectivity for C3+ paraffins and CO x is decreased. – the CO/CO2 ratio is increased, which shows the occurrence of homogeneous reactions in which the formation of CO is favored over CO2 more predominantly. 3.2 Influence of C2H6/O2 ratio Fig. 2 shows a strong influence of C2H6/O2 feed ratio on the process performance. With increase in the C2H6/O2 feed ratio, the process performance was influenced as follows. – The conversion of C2H6 and O2 is decreased, however, the decrease in O2 conversion is very small. – The selectivity for C2H4 and C2+ olefins is increased but the selectivity for CO x and selectivity for CH4 is decreased. However, the change in the selectivity for C3+ paraffins is very small. – The CO/CO2 ratio is increased, since O2 is available at lower and lower concentrations. 3.3 Influence of space velocity The influence of space velocity on the process performance (at 850°C) is shown in Fig. 3 . The increase in the space velocity (from 50,000 to 200,000cm3g−1h−1) results in: – a decrease in the conversion of reactants C2H6 and O2 as expected. However, the decrease in the O2 conversion is very small. – a increase in the selectivity for C2H4, C2+ olefins and C3+ paraffins but a decrease in the selectivity for CH4 and CO x , and – a large increase in the CO/CO2 ratio. The process is expected to involve a complex network of both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions such as catalytic and non-catalytic oxidative conversion of ethane reactions (exothermic) and thermal cracking of ethane (endothermic) reactions in the presence of limited O2 at the high temperature (≥700°C), as discussed earlier [9]. The catalytic reactions are more predominant at the lower temperatures (below 750°C). At the higher temperatures (above 750°C), the homogeneous (non-catalytic) and surface-originated homogeneous reactions also become increasingly important. The homogeneous reactions are simultaneously occurring with heterogeneous reactions. In order to reduce the contribution due to the homogenous reaction, low dead volume reactor packed with inert support was used. Our earlier studies on non-catalytic oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene in the presence of limited O2 [16] showed that because of the activation of ethane by molecular oxygen cracking ethyl radicals and their subsequent decomposition to ethylene [reactions 1 and 2 given below], the conversion of ethane purely by its thermal cracking is drastically increased. (1) C2H6 + O2 → C2H5 + HO2 (homogeneous reaction) (2) C2H5 → C2H4 + H (homogeneous reaction) Ethane is expected to be activated on the catalyst surface by the surface oxygen as follows. (3) C2H6 + [O]s → C2H5 + [HO]s (surface reaction) and the [O], sites are regenerated by the dehydration reaction, (4) 2[OH] → [O]s + H2O (surface reaction) 3.4 Influence of catalyst support The support provides not only better dispersion but also a high mechanically strength and thermally/hydro thermally stable porous matrix for the catalyst for practical use in the high temperature process. The particles or pellets of the catalyst without the support undergo disintegration into smaller pieces or powder causing an unacceptable larger pressure drop across the catalyst bed in the reactor, when exposed to humid atmospheres. The supported SrO-promoted Er2O3 showed better performance (higher ethane conversion, activity and selectivity for the C2+ olefins) than the unsupported catalyst in the process [13]. 4 Conclusions The high ethane conversion (50–70%) and high ethylene selectivity (≥80%) in the process can be obtained at very high space velocity (as high as 200, 000cm3 g−1 h−1) without formation of coke using the supported SrO-promoted Er2O3 catalyst. The mechanical strength as well as the surface area and the C2+ olefin selectivity [in the high temperature (>700°C) oxidative conversion of ethane to ethylene in presence of limited O2] of SrO-promoted Er2O3 catalyst are increased significantly because of supporting the catalyst on the low-surface area macro-porous silica–alumina catalyst carrier.
