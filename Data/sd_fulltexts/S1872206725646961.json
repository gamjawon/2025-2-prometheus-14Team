The concept of liquid-solid hybrid catalyst that featuring a truly homogeneous liquid microenvironment together with insoluble solid characteristics has been established recently by our group, which enables us to conveniently bridge the gap between homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, we extend this general concept to the confinement of molecular rhodium phosphine complexes, including Rh-TPPTS, Rh-TPPMS and Rh-SXP, for olefin hydroformylation reactions. A series of hybrid catalyst materials consisting a modulated liquid interior ([BMIM]NTf2, [BMIM]PF6, [BMIM]BF4 or H2O) and a permeable silica crust were fabricated through our developed Pickering emulsion-based method, showing 9.4–24.2-fold activity enhancement and significantly improved aldehyde selectivity (from 72.2%, 61.8% to 86.6%) compared to their biphasic counterparts or traditional supported liquid phase system in the hydroformylation of 1-dodecene. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency was demonstrated to be tunable by rationally engineering the thickness of porous crust and dimensions of the liquid pool. The thus-attained hybrid catalyst could also successfully catalyze the hydroformylation of a variety of olefin substrates and be recycled without a significant loss of activity for at least seven times. Graphical Abstract Molecular rhodium phosphine catalysts were confined within rationally designed liquid-solid hybrid microreactors, which exhibited excellent activity and aldehyde selectivity for olefin hydroformylation reactions. Keywords Immobilization Molecular catalyst Olefin hydroformylation Heterogeneous catalysis Hybrid microreactor 1 Introduction Hydroformylation of olefins is one of the largest homogeneously catalyzed industrial processes for the production of aldehydes or related products [1–5]. Molecular rhodium phosphine complexes are commonly used as the homogeneous catalysts because of their superior activity and selectivity [6–10]. However, ascribing to the intrinsic disadvantages of homogeneous catalysis system, the catalyst separation and recycling remain a major challenge and continue to be a focus of intense research [11–16]. As yet, numerous efforts have been devoted to the heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts or designing new heterogeneous systems, such as anchoring Rh complexes (or Rh nanoparticles) on support materials (like inorganic silica, organic polymer, and metal organic frameworks), biphasic catalysis, single atom catalysts (SACs) et al. [17–31]. Among these concepts, the liquid-liquid biphasic catalysis system has attracted especial attention, as exemplified by the industrially applied Ruhrchemie-Rhone/Poulenc process, in which aqueous dissolved catalyst, Rh-tris(m-sulfonatophenyl) phosphine (Rh-TPPTS) complex, was utilized, making the recycling of expensive Rh species feasible. Although satisfactory for light alkenes (C3–C4 olefins), this process is significantly hindered in the hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes, due to the low solubility of lipophilic substrates in the aqueous phase [32–36]. In this context, ionic liquids (ILs) based biphasic hydroformylation catalysis has been forward explored, in view of the much better solubility of ILs for higher alkenes and their good compatibility to rhodium phosphine complexes [37]. Nevertheless, such a biphasic system suffers from intrinsically high viscosity of ILs, leading to slow mass transport and deteriorated catalytic activity compared to the homogeneous counterparts. To circumvent the obstacles encountered in biphasic systems, the supported liquid phase (SLP) catalyst has been developed by dispersing Rh molecular catalyst in a liquid film contained on the large surface of a porous solid material [38–44]. Particularly, this concept is ideally suited for ILs-based system because of the extremely low vapor pressure of ILs medium, allowing long-term stability in continuous gas-phase hydroformylation reactions. However, SLP technology requires the liquid layer to be thin enough and is often impressionable to the support properties. Another milestone in this direction is the emulsion catalytic system, in which the bulk aqueous or ILs phase are divided into discrete micro- or nanoscale droplets, thereby creating enlarged interphase area and improved mass diffusion of reactants and products during the catalytic process. For instance, several Pickering emulsion systems stabilized by cyclodextrin, mesoporous silica nanospheres, or supramolecular hydrogel, have been examined for the hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes with drastically promoted catalytic activity and selectivity [45–47]. Nonetheless, the emulsion system has a limited working window, since the harsh reaction conditions of hydroformylation may lead to droplet coalescence or leaching of Rh molecular catalysts. Therefore, it is still challenging to achieve the heterogenized molecular catalysts with enhanced activity and stability for traditional biphasic systems. Recently, our group developed a liquid-solid hybrid catalyst that consisting a molecular catalyst-containing IL pool and a porous solid outer crust via a Pickering emulsion based interfacial growth method [48]. Ideally featuring the properties of macroscopically heterogeneous solids and microscopically homogeneous microenvironment, such a particular catalyst can efficiently integrate the bilateral advantages of homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. This approach, however, has not been explored for molecular rhodium phosphine complexes to date and hence preserves space for extended investigation on hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we applied the liquid-solid hybrid concept to the immobilization of common Rh molecular catalysts, including Rh-TPPTS [Rh-triphenylphosphine-3,3’,3’’- trisulfonic acid trisodium salt], Rh-TPPMS [Rh-diphenyl phosphinobenzene-3-sulfonate] and Rh-SXP [Rh-sulfo-xantphos], for the hydroformylation of long-chain olefins. As shown in Scheme 1 , through a simple Pickering droplets templated interfacial sol-gel process, the utilized Rh complexes together with their liquid microenvironment are in situ encapsulated within a silica crust. During the catalytic reactions, olefin reactants diffuse through the outer crust and encounter the molecular catalysts hosted inside the micron-scaled liquid pool, thus triggering the “homogeneous” catalysis within the confined space. Since the intrinsic merits of liquid-solid hybrid catalyst, such as modulated liquid interior, tunable dimension and controllable crust thickness, the catalytic efficiency can be rationally promoted by optimizing these influential factors. Moreover, benefiting from the surroundings of cations and anions, the Rh molecular catalysts are equably stabilized, which brings good recyclability of the hybrid catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of liquid-solid hybrid microreactors Typically, 4.0 mL of oil phase (n-octane) that dispersing with 15 mg silica emulsifier was added into 1.0 g ILs ([BMIM]PF6, [BMIM]NTf2 or [BMIM]BF4) that containing 2.58 mg (0.01 mmol) (acetylacetonato)dicarbonylrhodium(I), 18.2 mg (0.05 mmol) sodium diphenylphosphino-benzene-3-sulfonate and 28.4 mg (0.05 mmol) triphenyl-phosphine-3,3’,3’’-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt. The biphasic mixture was vigorously sheared using a homogenizer under 10000 rpm for 1 min, forming IL-in-oil Pickering droplets. The droplets were then dispersed into 30 mL n-octane that containing 0.07 g trimethoxymethylsilane (MTMS) and 150 µL of n-hexylamine. The mixture was rotated on a rolling apparatus at 30 °C overnight. Then, the upper n-octane phase was removed and the solid products were washed with n-octane for several times, the resulted liquid-solid hybrid microreactor was obtained. 2.2 Liquid-solid hybrid microreactor-catalyzed olefin hydroformylation reactions 1-Dodecene (10 mmol) and hybrid microreactor (1.0 g, 0.01 mmol Rh catalysts) were added into a reaction tube using toluene as solvent (5 mL). The reaction tube was transferred into a 250 mL high-pressure reactor. After replacing air with syngas (CO:H2 = 1:1), the reaction was conducted under stirring at 3 MPa and 110 °C, and the reaction solution was monitored by GC equipped with a FID detector. For recycling tests, the catalyst was centrifugated after reaction, and another portion of reactants were added directly for the next run. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Fabrication of the liquid-solid hybrid microreactors confining with molecular rhodium phosphine catalysts A similar synthetic method with our previous report was employed [48], which comprises a primary emulsification step and an interface directed sol-gel growth process. Several commercial ILs, including [BMIM]NTf2 [1-butyl-3- methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide], [BMIM]PF6 (1-butyl-3- methylimidazolium hexafluoro-phosphate) and [BMIM]BF4 (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) were chosen as the inner liquid phase, and hydrophobically modified silica nanoparticles (20 nm in size, Wacker Chemie) were used as the solid emulsifier (for details and characterization, see Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). Taking [BMIM]PF6 as an example, after vigorously shearing (10000 rpm) the biphasic mixture of IL and n-octane in the presence of silica emulsifier (1.5 wt%), a suspension of IL-in-oil Pickering droplets that are spherical in morphology and polydisperse in size with a mean diameter of 12 μm were fabricated, as verified by the optical microscopy and fluorescence microscopy observations ((Figs. 1(a) and (b) ). During this step, Rh molecular complexes dissolving in the IL phase were in situ confined within the microdroplet compartments. Then, hydrophobic methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) as a silica precursor was utilized to conduct the following interfacial sol-gel process for generating a porous crust around the liquid microdroplets, which had been demonstrated to be easily hydrolyzed and condensated under mild conditions at liquid-liquid interfaces [49]. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the resultant liquid-solid hybrid material comprises intact microspheres with a size distribution of 12 ± 5 μm from a low magnified image of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), of which the rough external surface is decorated with silica emulsifiers. After removing the interior IL, empty structure is clearly seen from a deliberately broken particle (Fig. 1(d). Further magnification of the outer crust reveals the formation of a dense and continuous silica layer with a thickness of ca. 110 nm as measured from a cross-sectional image (Fig. 1(e), suggesting an actual interfacial sol-gel growth process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation confirms the existence of irregular mesopores in the silica crust (Fig. 1(f), which will ensure the smooth mass transport during catalytic processes. Elemental mappings of the hybrid microreactor exhibit uniform distributions of Si, O, N, F, P and Rh (Fig. 1(g), confirming the successful confinement of both IL and Rh molecular catalysts. To reveal the thermal stability and specific content of encapsulated species in this hybrid microreactor, thermosgravimetric analysis (TGA) was also performed. As shown in Fig. 1(h), almost no weight loss was observed before 180 °C, while a drastic weight loss (ca. 92.1%) that mainly attributing to the decomposition of IL and Rh molecular species was received ranging from 180 to 800 °C. Such a high content of IL is meaningful for the potential implementation of a truly homogeneous catalysis process within the confined microreactors. Meanwhile, the porosity of silica crust was detected by N2 sorption analysis. As shown in Fig. 1(i), the empty microcapsules present a type IV isotherm along with a H4-type hysteresis loop, indicating the mesoporous structure of outer silica crust. The BET surface area and pore volume were measured to be 236.3 m2 g−1 and 0.485 cm3 g−1 respectively, and the mesopores were verified to be 12.0 nm by a BJH pore size distribution (Fig. 1(j). Benefiting from the controllable ability of our synthetic method, the fabricated hybrid microreactors are demonstrated to be manipulated in their capsule size, crust thickness and interior liquid type. As shown in Fig. 1(k), by altering the dosage of silica emulsifier during emulsification step from 0.9% to 1.5% (mass ratio compared to dispersed IL phase), the microcapsule size could be easily tuned from 53 to 12 μm, which are almost the same as their droplet matrixes (Fig. S2), confirming the templating effects. Moreover, the thickness of the formed silica crust could also be tailored by varying the amount of MTMS precursor. As displayed in Fig. 1(l), by increasing the MTMS amount from 0.03 to 0.07 and 0.10 g, the crust thickness of the hybrid microreactors gradually increased from 60 to 110 and 170 nm, while their morphology and particle size are similar with each other (Fig. S3). Additionally, the interfacial synthesis method is versatile and feasible to produce different hybrid microreactors with various liquid pools. As shown in Figs. S4 and 1(m), while utilizing [BMIM]NTf2, [BMIM]BF4 or H2O as the dispersed liquid phase, a series of Pickering droplets and their derived hybrid microreactors could be expectedly attained. In these cases, the capsule sizes were almost consistent with [BMIM]PF6 (ranging from 9 to 15 μm) as verified by the low magnified SEM observations, due to the same emulsifier dosage (1.5 wt%). Notably, the crust thickness of the hybrid microreactor with an aqueous pool is quite distinct from IL-based ones (240 vs. 100–120 nm), which might be ascribed to the higher condensation efficiency of MTMS at the water-oil interface. Likewise, all of these hybrid microreactors possess a very-high liquid content of 87.1%–94.8%, as demonstrated by the overall weight losses in their TGA curves (Fig. S5). N2 sorption measurement further identified the porosity of these microcapsules, as proved by the type IV isotherm together with a H4-type hysteresis loop. The BET surface area and total pore volume are determined to be 186.6, 167.0, 379.9 m2 g−1 and 0.498, 0.287, 0.464 cm3 g−1 respectively for [BMIM]NTf2, [BMIM]BF4 and H2O based microcapsules (Fig. S6). 3.2 Structural stability and molecular permeability We expected that the introduction of a porous crust around the Pickering droplets would not only remarkably reinforce their structural stability under high-temperature reaction conditions, but also impower good molecular permeability. To examine the strengthened stability, the liquid-solid hybrid micro-reactor ([BMIM]PF6 as the liquid core) was first immersed into a nonpolar long-chain alkene (1-dodecene) solution or a polar aldehyde (tridecanal) solution, followed by thermal treatments at varied temperatures (60, 90 and 120 °C). As shown in (Figs. 2(a) and (b) ), the hybrid microreactors exhibit good tolerance to both thermal treatment and tested organic surroundings, as verified by the preservation of their structural integrity under high-temperature treatment and tested solvent situations. In contrast, severe droplet breakage or coalescence occurred under such harsh conditions for Pickering droplets without growing a silica crust, suggesting the protection effects of the formed silica skeleton. Then, to evaluate the molecular permeability of the hybrid microreactor, we took Nile Red as a fluorescent probe to visualize the molecular diffusion processes. As recorded by a time-dependent fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 2(c), upon dipping a small aliquot of Nile Red solution into the hybrid microreactor dispersion, the fluorescent molecules that initially existed outside the capsule began to diffuse through the silica shell and enter the interior liquid pool as time prolongs. Within only 15 s, obvious fluorescent signals were distinctly seen throughout the whole liquid pool, indicating a fast mass transport. During the subsequent times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 s, the fluorescent intensity gradually increased as more Nile Red molecules were sequestered into the microcapsule. Notably, the molecular permeability of the hybrid microreactor could be readily regulated by tuning the crust thickness. As shown in Fig. S7, after decreasing the crust thickness from 170 to 60 nm, the molecular diffusion became faster due to the shortened diffusion distance. Meanwhile, the mass diffusion situations were also greatly impacted by the interior liquid pool. As shown in Fig. S8, fast molecular uptake was similarly observed for [BMIM]NTf2 and [BMIM]BF4, while decreased diffusion rate was found for aqueous pool, which might be attributed to the better solubility of ILs compared to H2O. From the above results, it can be seen that the reinforced microreactors are permeable and their molecular diffusion ability can be regulated by rational designing the synthetic parameters. 3.3 Evaluation of the liquid-solid hybrid microreactors in olefin hydroformylation reaction The catalytic capacity of the liquid-solid hybrid microreactors was then evaluated in the olefin hydroformylation reactions. A representative [BMIM]PF6-based hybrid catalyst encapsulated with molecular rhodium phosphine complexes [a mixture of TPPTS and TPPMS ligands together with Rh(acac)(CO)2 (dicarbonylacetylacetonato rhodium) precursor, molar ratio of TPPTS:TPPMS:Rh(acac)(CO)2 is 5:5:1] was first tested using 1-dodecene as a model substrate. As shown in Figs. 3 (a1) and (a3), the reaction proceeded smoothly at 110 °C under a syngas (CO/H2 = 1/1) pressure of 3 MPa, achieving a conversion of 99.7% with a desired aldehyde selectivity of 86.8% (n/b = 3.1) within 24 h. The by-products are mainly isomeric olefins and hydrogenation product dodecane. Such a catalytic result indicated that the molecular catalyst activity was well retained after confining them within the hybrid microreactors. To benchmark this catalytic performance, control experiments of IL-oil biphasic system, IL-in-oil Pickering emulsion system and porous material (SBA-15) supported IL phase system were simultaneously performed under identical conditions. As can be seen, much lower activity (56.2% conversion) and comparable aldehyde selectivity (72.2%, n/b = 2.7) were observed for the traditional biphasic system, in which the poor activity might be ascribed to the serious mass transport problem. Interestingly, although the crust-free Pickering emulsion system exhibited higher activity (80.9% conversion) than the biphasic system, its activity was still weaker than the hybrid microreactor. This is not so hard to be understood, since the formed microdroplets are not stable enough withstanding the reaction solution at high temperatures, as already demonstrated by the dramatical structure changes in aldehyde solutions. Notably, only 0.64% conversion was got using SBA-15 supported IL catalyst with a relatively high IL loading of 48 wt% (denoted as SBA-15-SIL-48 wt%). The much lower activity can be ascribed to the blocked pores with excess IL, which was demonstrated by the significantly enhanced performance using a low supported loading of 23 wt% (conversion 89.8%, aldehyde selectivity 85.5%, n/b = 3.1). For better evaluation of the catalytic difference, turnover frequency (TOF) on the basis of the amount of Rh species was also estimated. As shown in Fig. 3(a2), the liquid-solid hybrid microreactor affords a TOF value of 386.7 h–1, which is 9.4, 2.9 and 24.2 times higher than that of the biphasic system (41.3 h–1), Pickering emulsion system (132 h–1) and SBA-15 supported IL system (16 h–1), respectively. Such a superior activity can be mainly attributed to the unique liquid-solid hybrid microstructure, which not only provides a large liquid-liquid interface to alleviate the restriction of mass transfer in biphasic system but also creates a “homogeneous” reaction environment within the confined microreactor. To clarify the determining roles of the hybrid microstructure, we further studied the impacts of the capsule size and crust thickness on the catalytic efficiency. As shown in Figs. 3(b1) and (b2), along with the decreasing of capsule size from 53 to 32 and to 12 μm, the catalytic activity of the hybrid microreactor remarkably increased, yielding the final conversions and corresponding TOF values increased from 57.6% to 97.2% and to 99.6% and from 54.7 to 123.3 and 386.7 h–1 respectively. The observed catalytic trend as a function of microreactor size can be interpreted by the enlarged interface area and shortened diffusion distance of the reactants and products within the micron-sized IL pool, which lead to significant process intensification towards the biphasic catalysis situations. Moreover, the crust thickness also impacts the observed catalytic efficiency considerably. As shown in Figs. 3(c1) and (c2), upon increasing the crust thickness from 60 to 110 and 170 nm, the final conversion of the hybrid microreactors first increased from 73.6% to 99.5% and then decreased down to 86.7%, while the calculated TOF values first increased from 136.7 to 386.7 h–1 and then decreased down to 209.5 h–1. The enhanced activity with thinner crust thickness can be attributed to the faster molecular permeability as verified by our aforementioned fluorescent experimental results. However, the phenomenon of IL leakage occurred in the case of hybrid microreactor with too thin crust thickness (Fig. S9), thus resulting in the inversely decreased activity. These obtained results confirmed the special superiority of our liquid-solid hybrid microreactors in regulating the catalytic performance by rationally engineering their microstructures. Notably, although significant difference in catalytic activity, the aldehyde selectivities as well as the linear to branched ratios are remained comparable (Figs. 3(b3) and (3c3), due to the fact that physical encapsulation does not modify the equilibria existing between the same Rh catalytic species within the hybrid microreactors. On the other hand, the homogeneous environment inside the confined space is another influential factor for the catalytic performance of the hybrid microreactor. Hence, the impacts of different IL types on the catalytic activity and selectivity of the hydroformylation reaction was also explored. As shown in Figs. 4 (a1) and (a2), by altering the IL pools, the catalytic activity proved to be ranked in the following order: [BMIM]NTf2 > [BMIM]PF6 > [BMIM]BF4, and their TOF values varied significantly from 584.3 to 386.7 and 72.7 h–1. A highest activity is observed in the case of [BMIM]NTf2, however, its corresponding aldehyde selectivity (73.7%, Fig. 4(a3) is much lower than [BMIM]PF6 (86.8%) and [BMIM]BF4 (93.1%), while the n/b ratios are almost the same with each other (3.05:3.1). For comparison, we also evaluated the water-filled hybrid microreactor. As expected, all of the IL-based hybrid catalysts exhibited much higher activity than the aqueous based system (22.6% conversion within 24 h and TOF 28 h–1), which could be attributed to the improved solubility of lipophilic substrates in the IL phase. Furthermore, since the chemo- and regio-selectivities of hydroformylation reactions are known to depend on the organic ligand available for coordination, several different phosphine ligands, including TPPTS, TPPMS, SXP and TPPTS/TPPMS mixture were also investigated. As expected, the catalytic performances of different confined molecular Rhodium phosphine catalysts are quite different with each other. As shown in Figs. 4(b1)–(b3), dramatically improved performance in terms of both activity and selectivity was realized using bidentate SXP as ligand, in which almost full conversion could be got within 10 h along with aldehyde selectivity and n/b ratio reaching up to 93.1% and 38.3% respectively. In comparison, much lower activity (10.4% conversion) and selectivities (53.7% aldehyde selectivity and 2.7 n/b ratio) were obtained in the case of common TPPTS system under identical reaction conditions. Interestingly, in the case of TPPMS or TPPTS/TPPMS mixture, the observed activity and selectivities are apparently higher than that of the TPPTS system, giving rise to 53.9% and 91.5% of conversions within 10 h together with similar aldehyde selectivities (80.2% vs. 83.3%) and n/b ratios (3 vs. 3.1). These above results clearly indicate that the catalytic performance of the hybrid microreactors could be finely optimized by utilizing suitable ILs and Rh molecular catalysts. Moreover, the influence of reaction conditions including reaction temperature and H2/CO pressure were also studied. As shown in Figs. 4(c1) and (d1), it is obvious that the catalytic activity would be significantly promoted as the temperature increasing from 80 to 110 °C and gas pressure increasing from 1 to 3 MPa. Notably, the aldehyde selectivity (86%–86.8%) and n/b ratio (3 to 3.1) of the hybrid microreactor were not greatly varied under different conditions, indicating the similar coordination situations of Rh species. Having demonstrated the effectiveness and tunability of our liquid-solid hybrid microreactor in the hydroformylation reactions, we then tested its stability and reusability, which is a vital factor to evaluate a heterogeneous catalyst. Given the superior activity and selectivity of Rh-SXP based hybrid catalyst, it was chosen as model for detailed study. After each cycle, the oil solution was separated by simple centrifugation and another portion of oil phase was directly added for next run. As shown in Fig. 5(a) , the hybrid microreactor could be recycled at least 7 times while keeping the good conversions. However, the aldehyde selectivities are likely to be gradually decreased from 92.3% to 63%. Such a recycling ability is comparable to the traditional SBA-15 supported IL catalyst (Fig. S10). SEM image of the hybrid microreactor after recycling tests showed the essentially unchanged morphology and size (Fig. 5(b). Integrated with the negligible leaching of interior ILs (Fig. 5(c) and molecular Rh catalyst (below detection limit of ICP analysis and no typical absorbance peak assigned to the phenyl ring of Rh-SXP in UV-Vis spectra, as shown in Fig. S11), the decreased selectivity might be ascribed to the possible decomposition of the molecular catalyst. XPS indicates a reduction in Rh valence (Rh 3d 5 / 2 binding energy shift from 309.1 to 308.4 eV), suggesting electron transfer from P to Rh and Rh³+ → Rh+ reduction (Fig. S12). Concurrently, solid-state 31P NMR shows a marked decrease in Rh-complexed ligand signals (δ = 31 ppm) after cycling (Fig. S13), accompanied by ligand migration to surface-bonded states (δ = –21 ppm). The XPS and solid-state ³¹P NMR analyses suggest that the activity and selectivity decline might be related with the ligand-Rh coordination weakening and partial oxidative decomposition of SXP ligand [31,43]. Given the aforementioned results with 1-dodecene as the substrate, we extended the hybrid microreactor to the hydroformylation of other olefin substrates with varied alkyl lengths. As shown in Fig. 5(d), within a reaction time of 10 h, over 98.4%, 97.6% and 99% of 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-decene were already converted, yielding desired aldehydes with 78.7%–90.2% selectivity and 19.1–25.6 n/b ratio. However, only 72% of hydrophobic 1-octadecene was hydroformylated under the same reaction conditions, indicating the regular decrease of catalytic activity while increasing the length of the alkyl chain. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we present the extension of our liquid-solid hybrid concept to the encapsulation of molecular rhodium phosphine complexes for bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysis. A series of hybrid catalysts featuring with a homogeneous-like IL microenvironment and a permeable silica crust were successfully fabricated through a reliable Pickering emulsion-based method. Diverse molecular catalysts including Rh-TPPTS, Rh-TPPMS, Rh-SXP and their mixtures have been encapsulated. Moreover, leveraging the tunable crust thickness and capsule size of the hybrid microreactors, the catalytic efficiency could be rationally designed. The thus-attained hybrid catalyst was demonstrated to be stable enough for recycling at least 7 times without a significant loss of activity, and feasible to the hydroformylation of a variety of olefin substrates. We believe that our study not only expand the application areas of the liquid-solid hybrid catalyst, but also offers a new way for filling the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous hydroformylations.

        "dc:description": "The concept of liquid-solid hybrid catalyst that featuring a truly homogeneous liquid microenvironment together with insoluble solid characteristics has been established recently by our group, which enables us to conveniently bridge the gap between homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, we extend this general concept to the confinement of molecular rhodium phosphine complexes, including Rh-TPPTS, Rh-TPPMS and Rh-SXP, for olefin hydroformylation reactions. A series of hybrid catalyst materials consisting a modulated liquid interior ([BMIM]NTf2, [BMIM]PF6, [BMIM]BF4 or H2O) and a permeable silica crust were fabricated through our developed Pickering emulsion-based method, showing 9.4–24.2-fold activity enhancement and significantly improved aldehyde selectivity (from 72.2%, 61.8% to 86.6%) compared to their biphasic counterparts or traditional supported liquid phase system in the hydroformylation of 1-dodecene. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency was demonstrated to be tunable by rationally engineering the thickness of porous crust and dimensions of the liquid pool. The thus-attained hybrid catalyst could also successfully catalyze the hydroformylation of a variety of olefin substrates and be recycled without a significant loss of activity for at least seven times.",
