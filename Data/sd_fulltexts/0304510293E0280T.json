Part 9. Conversion of n-octane with Pt-Sn catalysts at atmospheric pressure Ram Srinivasan and Burtron H. Davis* Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA (Received January 18, 1993; accepted November 5, 1993 ) Abstract Tin alters the activity and stability of a series of Pt-alumina catalysts. Depending upon the support, dehydrocyclization may occur by a monofunctional metal catalyzed pathway or in combination with a bifunctional pathway involving both metal and support. The initial tin added by coimpregnation with Pt is found to decrease the activity of a catalyst based on acidic alumina but to promote the activity of one based on a nonacidic support. When the catalyst based on an acidic alumina contains sufficient tin to eliminate the acidity of the support, and thereby the bifunctional pathway, the activity pattern vs. Sn/Pt ratio for the nonacidic and acidic based catalysts have a similar form. For similar Sn/Pt bulk compositions, a catalyst based upon coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide differs significantly from the one based on an acidic or non-acidic alumina support. The results show that tin may serve (1) to enhance metal dispersion at lower loading, (2) to form a Pt: Sn =1 : 1 alloy with a higher dehydrocyclization activity than Pt alone, (3) to modify the aromatics selectivity from the dehydrocyclization of n-octane and (4) to poison acid sites and thereby eliminate the more rapid pathway to produce aromatics. Key words: dehydrocyclization; octanes; platinum; tin 1. Introduction The Pt-Sn system has been studied extensively, both from the standpoint of the structure of the catalyst as well as the reason for the superior catalytic properties. Davis utilized PtSn complexes, including Pt3SnsClZO , in an organic solvent to decrease or eliminate the hydrolysis of the tin compound used to prepare supported catalysts [ I ] . It was proposed Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All fights reserved SSD10304-5102(93)E0280-T 344 R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (7994) 343-358 that the reason for the superior activity of catalysts prepared in this manner was the formation of a Pt-Sn alloy [2,3] . Burch and coworkers [ 4-7 ] reported on the use of Pt-Sn catalysts for hydrocarbon conversions. It was concluded that alloys of Pt and Sn were not formed so that this could not account for the changes in the catalytic properties imparted by Sn [4] . Burch and Garla concluded for these catalysts that: (i) n-hexane is isomerized by a bifunctional mechanism, (ii) benzene and methylcyclopentane are formed directly from n-hexane at metal sites, and (iii) the conversion of methylcyclopentane requires acidic sites [ 5 ] . It was concluded that the Sn(II) ions modified the Pt electronically with the result that self-poisoning by hydrocarbon residues is reduced. These later observations were the results of conversions at a pressure of one atmosphere. V61ter and coworkers [ 8-15 ] have also reported extensively on the Pt-Sn catalyst system over a number of years. In an early study, tin was found to decrease both hydrogen adsorption and the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation but to increase the activity for n-heptane dehydrocyclization [ 8,9] . It was also reported that bimetallic catalysts can have both a positive and a negative shift of the activity and selectivity. The negative effect is connected with mild reaction conditions, and the positive effect with the severe deactivation reaction of aromatization. For dehydrocyclization the role of Sn is to decrease poisoning by carbonaceous residues. Lank et al. [ 11 ] obtained similar results for n-hexane conversion using either an alumina supported or an unsupported Pt-Sn catalyst; thus, they attributed the impact of tin to a direct interaction with Pt, and not to an interaction of Sn with alumina. VDlter and Kurschner [ 12] found that the addition of tin caused an increased production of benzene from methylcyclopentane, and at the same time a decrease in hydrogenolysis and deactivation, even though coke formation was not diminished from that of the Pt-alumina catalyst. V61ter and Kurschner attributed these effects to Pt-Sn alloy formation. Paal et al. [ 14] reported evidence for the formation of hexatrienes during n-hexane conversion, and that the amount of the trienes was markedly higher for the bimetallic Pt-Sn or Pt-Pb catalyst. Lieske et al. [ 15] reported that the added tin increased the extent of coking by forming hexene but at the same time a larger part of the Pt remained free. They explained this by a drain-off effect of the alloying tin: on Pt-Sn/A1203 the coke precursors are more easily transferred to alumina. The hydrocarbon conversion studies by V61ter and coworkers were at normal pressure. Figueras and coworkers [ 16-18] have also investigated the catalytic activity of Pt-Sn catalysts for hydrocarbon conversions. For the conversion of n-heptane with Pt-Sn supported on a non-porous Degussa alumina, the authors concluded that tin poisons the strong acid sites of the support and part of the platinum; these authors were surprised at the wide use of Pt-Sn based catalysts for commercial applications [16]. For methylcyclopentane conversion, Coq and Figueras [ 17,18] found that tin provides a stabilizing effect on Pt and imparts a decrease in the extent of hydrogenolysis. An enhancement in the aromatization of methylcyclopentane was observed as the tin content was increased; the aromatization passed through a maximum and then decreased with further increases in Sn/Pt ratios. The dehydrogenation of methylcyclopentane to methylcyclopentene remained unchanged as the Sn/Pt ratio was increased. These authors also conducted their studies at atmospheric pressure. Dautzenberg et al. [ 19 ] tested a number of unsupported Pt-Sn alloys as well as a number R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 345 of alumina supported Pt-Sn catalysts. n-Hexane conversion was effected at atmospheric pressure for the unsupported alloy catalysts and for some supported catalysts; other studies with a supported catalyst were at 3 bar. These authors reported that the addition of tin decreased the amount of methylcyclopentane that was formed and that coke was dramatically reduced during the conversion of n-hexane. Sexton et al. [20] also examined the activity of a series of Pt-Sn alumina catalysts with varying Sn/Pt ratios for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the conversion of methy1cyclopentane. They found that the activity decreased as the Sn/Pt ratio increased. The selectivity for benzene formation from methylcyclopentane increased to a maximum at about 1.5 to 2.5 wt.% Sn (0.5 wt.% Pt) and then declined. These conversions were conducted at normal pressures. Beltramini and Trimm [ 21 ] utilized Pt-, Sn- and Pt-Sn-supported on y-alumina for the conversion of n-heptane at 500 C and 5 bar. They observed that during six hours of reaction time less coke per mole of heptane converted was deposited on the Pt-Sn-alumina catalyst than on a Pt-alumina catalyst; however, the total amount of coke formed during six hours was much greater on the Pt-Sn-alumina than on Pt-alumina. The addition of tin increased the selectivity of alkane dehydrocyclization. Since hydrocracking and isomerization activity of a Sn-alumina catalyst remained high in spite of coke formation, the authors concluded that there was little support for the suggestion that tin poisons most of the acid sites on the catalyst. These authors [22] also measured activity, selectivity and coking over a number of alumina supported catalysts, such as, Pt, Pt-Re, Pt-Ir, Pt-Sn and Pt-Ge. Coke formation was significantly reduced on these bimetallic catalysts compared to Pt-alumina; the results show that it is not only the amount but the location of coke that is important in determining catalyst performance. The greater efficiency of the bimetallic s depended on both the amount of coke formed and its location. Karpinski and Clarke [ 23 ] compared the results of the conversion of n-pentane and nhexane on Pt-Sn and Pt-Rh alloy films. In the temperature range of 320-400 C ( = 10 torr pressure with HZ/hydrocarbon= 10/1), they found the ratio of 1,5 and 1,6 ring closure, SS/S6, was less than unity for pure Pt; as the Sn/Pt ratio increased the SS/S6 ratio increased to a maximum and then decreased. The authors concluded that surface carbiding [24] controlled SS/S6 selectivity for Pt; as the carbide was formed there was a shift from 1,5 to 1,6 ring closure. The addition of Sn decreased carbide formation; thus at low Sn/Pt ratios the value of SS/S6 increased. Thus, 1,5 cyclization selectivity patterns were interpreted in terms of the change in active site number, with possible modification by carbiding. Tin addition markedly decreased hydrogenolysis. Clarke et al. [ 25 ] also presented preliminary data obtained in a pulse reactor for Pt-Sn-silica catalysts. Li and Klabunde [ 26] utilized a pulse reactor at 1 atm pressure. Pt and Sn were evaporated into a solvent at low temperature and then the solvent was allowed to warm to room temperature which resulted in the agglomeration of atoms to produce a dispersion of colloidal particles. These were then added to an alumina support. These catalysts were compared to conventional Pt-Sn-alumina catalysts for n-heptane conversion. The authors proposed that the presence of small amounts of Sn on the surface of Pt can cause both an increase in catalytic activity and a decrease in hydrogenolysis. As a means of catalyst preparation Margitfalvi and coworkers, e.g., [ 27-30] , have utilized a controlled surface reaction in which a volatile Sn (or Pt) compound is allowed to react 346 R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 88 (1994) 343-358 with Pt (or Sn) already present on a support. They utilized conventional and transient kinetic approaches to study the mechanism of hydrocarbon reactions on these catalysts; conversions were effected at atmospheric or lower pressures. These authors found a perplexing variety of activity patterns, depending upon the manner and sequence in which Pt and Sn were added. Depending upon the preparation conditions, the added tin may either enhance or decrease Pt activity and increase or decrease the selectivity for hydrogenolysis [27]. Lin et al. [ 31 ] reported that there are two types of sites on Pt-Sn-alumina catalysts: M, sites adsorb hydrogen that can react with ethene while hydrogen adsorbed on MZ sites does not react with ethene. Aromatization and hydrogenolysis activity increased rapidly with an increase of M, sites, while isomerization activity increased sharply with an increase in M2 sites. Zhang et al. [ 32 ] argued that the addition of Sn reduced the amount of carbon deposited on the metal surface. Gault et al. [33] converted '3C labeled hydrocarbons over catalysts containing 10% Pt and varying amounts of tin (0.2 to 5 wt.%) on an alumina support at low (5.5 tort) or atmospheric pressure. The support was an inert alumina and, even though the catalysts contained 1 to 1.2% Cl, the authors did not consider the catalyst to have acidic character. They reported that the catalyst loaded with 10% Pt and small amounts of Sn had the same catalytic properties as very highly dispersed Pt-alumina catalysts. Sarkany et al. [34] considered the formation of carbon deposits from hydrocarbons at normal pressure. They conclude that carbon deposition is decreased by the addition of tin but the rate of formation of carbon residues through a \"polyene\" route is increased with the addition of tin. Wilde et al. [ 35 ] , using normal pressure conditions, also emphasize the high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization by 1,6 ring closure due to lower carbon deposition on these catalysts. For the most part, the data for alkane and cycloalkane conversion with Pt-Sn catalysts have been obtained at atmospheric pressure or lower reaction conditions. For commercial reforming operations, a much higher pressure is utilized. Thus, most of the activity data for Pt-Sn catalysts have been obtained at low pressures and it remains an open question as to how this data compares to that obtained under commercial reforming conditions. Furthermore, even for the data obtained at atmospheric pressure the range of catalyst compositions and reaction conditions have led to many conflicting views of the role of Sn as outlined above. It is therefore of interest to generate data for a series of Pt-Sn catalysts utilizing both acidic and non-acidic supports at these lower pressure conditions with the view of resolving some of the conflicting views and for comparison with data obtained at higher operating pressures. 2. Experimental The experimental details were given in previous publications [2,3] . The silica (Davison Chemical Co., 340 m'/g) and acidic alumina (United Catalysts, Inc., 300 m'/g) supports were impregnated (or coimpregnated) with an acetone solution of chloroplatinic acid (or chloroplatinic acid and stannous chloride to produce several Sn/Pt ratios), then dried in air at 120 C, and calcined in air at 400 C. A tin-aluminum oxide support (200 m`/g) was R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis/ Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 347 prepared by coprecipitation from a solution containing both tin chloride and aluminum chloride by the addition of ammonia. A non-acidic alumina was prepared by precipitation from a potassium aluminate solution using COZ (200 m2 /g after calcination at 600 C). These latter two supports were also impregnated with an acetone solution containing chloroplatinic acid or the appropriate mixture of chloroplatinic acid and stannous chloride. Each catalyst contained 1.0 wt.% Pt and the appropriate amount of Sn to give the indicated Sn: Pt ratio. The catalyst was reduced at 500 C in-situ in a glass plug-flow reactor. Conversions were effected at atmospheric pressure without added hydrogen at 482 C. Conversions and product distributions were calculated from gas chromatographic data [ 2,3 ] . 3. Results 3.1. Coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide supported catalysts The data in Fig. 1 show that tin acts as a promoter in both increasing the total conversion and in decreasing the rate of decline of total conversion. The time required for the total conversion to decline to a certain level (say 20% or 40%) increases as the Sn/Pt ratio increases. The aromatic products are near an equilibrium composition for each of the three Sn : Pt ratios: 0 : 1, 1:1, and 3 : 1; in spite of this, there are differences among the aromatics produced by the three catalysts. For the Sn : Pt = 0 :1 catalyst an equilibrium aromatic composition was obtained except for possibly the initial sample. Thus, even though the activity of the metallic function declined drastically during the 8 h of operation, sufficient isomerization activity, presumably the bifunctional pathway involving alkane isomerization requiring support acidity, remained so as to produce nearly an equilibrium C8-aromatic composition. The Sn:Pt=1:1 catalyst produced aromatic compositions further removed from an equilibrium composition than the other two catalysts based on a coprecipitated support. 120 ia z 100 O N Q: W Z O 60 V W Z a h V 40 O 20 f 11 0 L J_ 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 TIME (HOUR) Fig. 1.

Initially the predominant aromatic products are those anticipated for direct six-carbon ring closure of n-octane. For the initial samples, about 70% of the C8-aromatics were ethylbenzene (EB) and o-xylene (OX), the products expected for a direct six-carbon ring formation; the ratio of OX: EB is 1.5 :1. With time, the aromatic distribution changes but does not attain an equilibrium composition even after 36 h (Fig. 2). With increasing reaction time there is a gradual decline in the fraction of OX and an increase in m-xylene (MX). The fraction of EB is essentially constant for about 25 h after which there is a gradual increase in EB. Likewise, p-xylene (PX) remains essentially constant during the 36 h run. The aromatic products from n-octane conversion over the Sn: Pt=3: 1 approaches but does not attain an equilibrium value at longer time on stream. The failure to attain the equilibrium composition at longer time on stream is primarily due to the high fraction of EB. With this Pt/Sn catalyst, about 60% of the initial C8-aromatic products correspond to those expected for direct six-carbon ring closure; the initial OX/EB ratio was about 1.9. Thus, the initial OX: EB ratio approaches the value of 2; this is much greater than the value of 0.5 expected for a statistical distribution allowed by direct six-carbon ring formation. With time the amount of OX decreases with a corresponding increase in the amount of MX; the fraction of EB and PX remain essentially constant during the conversion. R. Srinivasan, B. H.

Degussa alumina supported catalysts The next series of catalysts to be considered are based upon a Degussa alumina oxide C. This alumina support is composed of non-porous spherical particles and has a surface area of 110 m2/g. Tin clearly has an impact upon catalyst activity and stability (Fig. 3). In this instance the activity appears to first decline as the Sn/Pt ratio is increased to 1:1, then increases with a further Sn/Pt ratio increase, and then declines again with a further increase. The C8-aromatic distribution for the Sn : Pt =1: 1 ratio is close to an equilibrium composition (Fig. 4). The aromatic distributions obtained with the other Sn: Pt and the Pt only on the Degussa alumina are similar to the one shown in Fig. 4. 350 R. Srinivasan, B.H.

High surface area UCI alumina supported catalysts The activity and stability for the catalyst series based on the UCI alumina show the following trend: the Sn/Pt=8:1 catalyst exhibits the slowest decline in activity, this is followed by the Pt without tin, and then the decline for the other three catalysts is in the order Pt: Sn -1:1, Pt: Sn = 5 : I = Pt: Sn = 8 : 3 (Fig. 5) . The conversion after three hours for catalysts with increasing Sn/Pt loading shows a rapid decrease, then a low level of conversion at intermediate Sn/Pt ratios, and finally an increase in activity at a higher Sn/ Pt ratio ( Fig. 6) . This trend contrasts with that of the catalysts based on Degussa Aluminum Oxide C. The C8-aromatic selectivity varies as the Sn/Pt ratio is varied. For the catalyst containing only Pt, the C8-aromatics are near the composition expected for a chemical equilibrium distribution during the course of the 7.5 h run.

Ethyl benzene and o-xylene are formed as major products (55% of C8-aromatics) in the initial conversion period with the Sn/Pt=2.67 catalyst but after two hours the C$-aromatics are near an equilibrium distribution. This trend continues in a more exaggerated manner for the Sn : Pt = 5 : 1 catalyst (Fig. 7) . In the sample collected after one hour, ethylbenzene and o-xylene account for more than 80% of the C8aromatics. However, the amount of these two isomers decrease in the 2 and 3 h samples so that the samples collected at 4 h and later have essentially an equilibrium C8-aromatic composition. This trend continues with increasing Sn : Pt ratio so that an equilibrium composition of C8-aromatics is not obtained even after 30 h of time-on-stream for the Sn : Pt = 8 :1 catalyst (Fig. 7) . Ethylbenzene and o-xylene are the dominant products during the entire 30 h run; however, there is an increase in m-xylene with a corresponding decrease in the amount of o-xylene during the first 15 h of operation; thereafter, there is little change in the composition of the C8-aromatic fraction. 352 R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 3.4. Silica supported catalysts The activity of the Pt-Sn-S'02 catalysts shows first an increase over that of Pt alone and then a decline as the Sn/Pt ratio increases further (Fig. 8). For the catalyst with Sn/Pt of 5 or 12, the low activity is maintained at essentially a constant level for ca. 8 h of reaction. For the catalyst with the two lower Sn/Pt ratios, the activity declines during a 7 h period to approach the activity level of the two catalysts with the higher Sn/Pt ratios. However, Sn is promoting the activity over that of Pt alone for the three lower Sn : Pt ratios. For three of the catalysts, the C8 aromatics are those expected for direct six-carbon ring closure; however, the aromatic distribution does depend upon catalyst composition. For the Sn:Pt=1:1 catalyst EB and OX comprise greater than 95% of the C8-aromatics; the remainder of the C8-aromatics are predominantly MX with PX being present in less than 0.1 wt.% (Fig. 9). For the two intermediate Sn/Pt catalysts (Sn:Pt=8:3 and 5: 1) the aromatics at first are predominantly EB and OX but gradually approach an equilibrium 0 z O > 40 z O U W z ?D Q H U O C 60 so - 30 - 10 ~- 0 I I I I 8 10 12 14 0 2 4 6 Sn/Pt Fig. 8.

For the Sn : Pt =12 :1 catalyst, the amount of EB is about the same as with the catalysts of lower Sn: Pt ratios; however, the amount of OX is much lower and MX much higher than was obtained for the two intermediate Sn/ Pt ratios. The C8-aromatics distribution for the Sn : Pt =12 :1 catalyst is similar to the one that is the Sn : Pt = 8 : 3 and 5 : 1 catalysts approach at longer time on stream. For the PtSi02 catalyst ethylbenzene and o-xylene were the dominant C8 aromatics ( > 90%) and the OX: EB ratio was about 0.9:1. For the Sn:Pt= I : I catalyst the OX/EB ratio is approximately 1.3 to 1.4 :1. For the higher Sn : Pt ratio catalyst this ratio is smaller. It appears that the addition of Sn to a Pt_Si02 catalyst alters the OX:EB ratio in much the same way it does when alumina is the support, and that is to favor OX over EB. 4. Discussion The results for the Pt_Si02 and Pt-Sn-S'02 catalysts resemble those reported earlier for non-acidic alumina supported catalysts [ 1-3 ] . Adding tin to the Pt_Si02 catalyst initially results in an increase in activity but with further increase in Sn/Pt ratio a maximum in activity is attained, and a further increase in the Sn/Pt ratio results in a decrease in catalyst activity. The two supports differ since the maximum activity was obtained for the nonacidic alumina support at a Sn / Pt ratio of about 4 whereas for the silica support the maximum occurred at a Sn/Pt ratio of 1, or less. The maximum in catalytic activity for the non-acidic alumina and silica supports appears to follow the pattern observed for Pt-Sn alloy formation for these catalyst series [ 3O4] . In general the characterization data showed that the dominant alloy was Sn : Pt =1:1 and that the maximum alloy formation, for a loading of 1 wt.% Pt that was used in both the activity and characterization studies, occurred at a Sn/Pt ratio of about 4 to 5 for a high surface area non-acidic alumina support but at a ratio of about 1 for a silica support. Thus, for both non-acidic supports, where the formation of aromatics is by only a metal catalyzed pathway, the addition of Sn increases both alloy formation and catalytic activity. Likewise, there is a selectivity change in the distribution of the C8-aromatics that are allowed by direct six-carbon ring formation, EB and OX, so the OX is favored with increasing Sn/Pt ratios. The data therefore lead us to the following conclusions: 1. The extent of formation of a Pt/Sn alloy increases with increasing Sn concentration at constant Pt loading. 2. The extent of n-octane conversion increases, and then decreases, with increasing Sn/ Pt ratio. 3. The increase in dehydrocyclization activity parallels an increase in Sn/Pt alloy formation and attains a maximum at about the same Sn/Pt ratio as where Pt is completely alloyed. 4. As the Sn/Pt ratio increases beyond that needed to convert the Pt to Pt-Sn alloy, the activity declines. 5. By inference, the Pt-Sn alloy is more active than Pt alone for single-function metal catalyzed dehydrocyclization, but the Pt-Sn alloy is \"poisoned\" by excess tin that could 354 R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 produce a surface layer rich in Sn or by another alloy that is tin rich as, for example, PtSn3. The situation is more complex when an acidic alumina support is employed since noctane dehydrocyclization is more rapid for the bifunctional pathway than by the monofunctional metal catalyzed pathway [45 ] . Thus, the results for the high area alumina support are considered first. For this support a series of catalysts were prepared so that the Sn/Pt ratio varied from 0 to 8. As shown in Fig. 6, there is a decline in activity (the three hour activities are compared in Fig. 6) as the Sn/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 5; it is postulated that this decline is due to poisoning of the acid sites of the support by the added tin so that the fraction of aromatics formed by the more rapid bifunctional pathway is decreased, or essentially eliminated. The C8-aromatic distribution is in agreement with this view since the Pt-A1203 catalyst (Sn/Pt=0) produced a product distribution corresponding to a chemical equilibrium composition. As the Sn/Pt ratio increased to Sn:Pt=5:1, initially the two aromatics formed by direct six-carbon ring closure, EB and OX, dominated but with increasing reaction time the C8-aromatic distribution approached an equilibrium composition. This data is consistent with tin eliminating the acidity due to the alumina support so that the majority of the C8-aromatics are the result of an increasing contribution of noctane aromatization by the metal function pathway with increasing Sn/Pt ratios; however, as the catalyst ages the fraction of C8-aromatics formed by the bifunctional pathway increases. Thus, it appears that the following reaction pathways are applicable: meta EB + OX n-C ~O ~ _ H` metals n-CO - n-C8- + j-CB= R . R. 6- H. metal EB,OX,MX,PX metal EB,OX,MX,PX C R, R ' - H, CH3 or CZHS) Finally, with the Sn : Pt = 8 : 1 catalyst the activity increases from the low level of a catalyst with the ratio Sn: Pt=5:1. This activity is primarily due to the Pt/Sn alloy and produces C$-aromatics that are predominantly EB and OX over the entire reaction time (30 h). The catalyst characterization data indicate that with the high surface area alumina a Sn : Pt ratio greater than 5:1 is required to attain the maximum XRD intensity of Pt-Sn alloy. Thus, the characterization data indicate that alloy formation increases'with increasing Sn/ R. Srinivasan, B.H. Davis/ Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 355 Pt ratios, but for this catalyst the increase in alloy formation parallels a decrease in the catalytic activity. It therefore appears that a portion of the tin present in this catalyst reacts with the alumina support to decrease the activity by eliminating or poisoning the acid sites more rapidly than it combines with Pt to form an alloy. The catalyst characterization data [ 37,46 ] for the catalysts based on the Degussa alumina follow the trend exhibited by the catalysts based on the high surface alumina. However, with the lower surface area, non-porous alumina, the Pt is converted to the maximum amount of Pt-Sn alloy at a lower Sn:Pt ratio than was the case for the high surface area UCI alumina supported catalysts. Thus, the initial decrease in activity followed by increased conversion occurs as the Sn : Pt ratio is varied from 0 to 2.67 :1 rather than the range of 0 to 5 :1 that was observed for the UCI support. As with the Pt-Sn-S'02 catalyst series, the very high Sn : Pt ratios produce a decline in the catalytic activity due to Sn covering the Sn/Pt alloy(s). In the case of the catalysts based upon the Degussa alumina, the C8_ aromatics do not exhibit as clear-cut alteration in the C8-aromatics as was the case with the catalysts based on the UCI alumina support. However, the C8-aromatic products from Sn/ Pt = 0 have the equilibrium composition. The aromatics for the Sn : Pt = 2.67 :1 catalyst contain about 70% EB plus OX as was observed for Sn : Pt = 5 :1 for the UCI catalyst. The C8-aromatic products for the low activity Sn : Pt = 5 :1 on Degussa alumina catalyst contains about 30% EB (vs. about 10% at equilibrium); however, it appears that the xylene isomers are near the equilibrium value. The activity of the catalysts based on the coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide (Sn/Al oxide) exhibits a different trend than the two catalyst series prepared by impregnation of an alumina support, both in alloy formation based upon the characterization data and in activity changes with increasing Sn : Pt ratios. For a given Sn : Pt ratio, based upon bulk analyses, the coimpregnated catalyst had a significantly larger fraction of Pt present in an alloy form than for the catalyst based upon the coprecipitated Sn/Al oxide. This indicates that the surface Sn concentration in the coprecipitated Sn/Al oxide is much lower than on a catalyst with the same bulk composition that was prepared by coimpregnation with Pt and Sn. Thus, as the Sn : Pt ratio, based on bulk analysis for the coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide, increases the surface Sn concentration is not sufficiently high to form a significant amount of Pt-Sn alloy. The data also indicate that the surface Sn concentration is too low to reduce the catalyst acidity by a significant amount. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicated that both Sn and Pt could be detected for the UCI based catalyst but only Pt could be detected for the Sn/Al oxide based catalyst; this is consistent with the dominant fraction of Sn being present in the bulk of the Sn/Al oxide catalyst [38]. The catalytic activity for the coprecipitated catalyst increases with increasing Sn : Pt ratios (based on bulk composition). Presumably the beneficial role of Sn in the coprecipitated catalyst is to aid in maintaining Pt dispersion so that dehydrocyclization is effected by the bifunctional pathway. The data for the four catalyst series present a consistent picture for the role of Sn in PtA1203 alkane dehydrocyclization catalysts. Presumably the conclusions given below are applicable as a guide to defining alkane dehydrocyclization pathways for the low pressure naphtha reforming operations: 1. For a catalyst based upon a non-acidic support, the addition of Sn to give the lower Sn : Pt ratios causes the activity to increase to a maximum, and beyond this composition an increase in the Sn/Pt ratio results in a decrease in catalytic activity. The Sn: Pt ratio that 356 R. Srinivasan, B.H Davis /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 343-358 produces the maximum activity will depend upon the support material (silica, alumina, etc.) and on the surface area of the support. For a silica support the maximum activity is attained at a lower Sn:Pt ratio than for alumina of a similar surface area. With each support material, the Sn : Pt ratio for maximum activity increases with increasing surface area. 2. The major fraction (90% or greater) of the Cs-aromatics are formed by a direct sixcarbon ring formation for catalysts based on a non-acidic support. Thus, for n-octane the major products are EB and OX; the ratio of OX: EB increases from about 1 : 1 or even 1: 2 for the catalyst containing Pt only to about 2 :1 for the Sn : Pt =1:1 alloy. This change to favor the OX aromatic isomer is considered to be because the Pt in the alloy is less electron deficient and this favors the aromatic that is formed by an adsorption that favors the weaker secondary C-H bonds of n-octane and leads to OX over the adsorption that involves the stronger primary C-H bond that must be ruptured if EB is produced. 3. For the catalyst prepared by coimpregnation of an acidic alumina the activity initially decreases with an increase in Sn : Pt ratio (Figs. 3 and 6) . The initial decline is followed by an increase in catalytic activity to attain a maximum and this is then followed by a decline in activity with increasing Sn : Pt ratios. The latter part of the activity vs. Sn : Pt ratio curve is similar to the one obtained with the non-acidic support that has been displaced to a higher Sn/Pt ratio. Thus, the initial decline in activity is considered to result from elimination of acid sites of the support as Sn is added to increase the Sn:Pt ratio; as the acid sites are eliminated the bifunctional pathway is eliminated. When most of the acid sites have been eliminated, further increases in the Sn : Pt ratio results in an activity pattern that is similar to that of the catalysts that are based on a non-acidic support.

The activity pattern can be summarized by the schematic shown in Fig. 10. 4. The C8 aromatics for the lower Sn:Pt ratio catalysts based on an acidic alumina have essentially an equilibrium composition that results from the isomerization of n-octane to iso-octanes through a bifunctional pathway as well as the acid catalyzed isomerization of the alkylcyclopentenes to produce alkylcyclohexenes. When most, or all, of the acid sites have been eliminated by Sn, the C8-aromatic distribution resembles those obtained by a Sn/Pt alloy on a non-acidic support. 5. For Pt-Sn catalysts based on a coprecipitated Sn/Al oxide, a measurable amount of alloy is not formed [46] . Additionally, most of the Sn appears to be located within the bulk of the support [46] so that the concentration of surface Sn is too low to eliminate an appreciable amount of acidity even for a catalyst with a Sn : Pt ratio of 3 : 1. The activity for these catalysts is therefore believed to be due to a bifunctional mechanism. The role of tin in these catalysts is believed to be due to the maintenance of small Pt crystals during catalyst usage. The retardation of Pt agglomeration may be by a mechanism as proposed by McVicker et al. [ 47 ] where the surface Sn ions provide traps to greatly retard Pt atom migration. The C8-aromatics formed from the three catalyst composition of this catalyst series have a composition that is essentially an equilibrium distribution, as expected for aromatics produced by a bifunctional. 6. The activity patterns with increasing Sn : Pt ratios, the dependence of maximum activity on the support material, and the dependence of the maximum on support surface area are consistent with extensive characterization data with these catalysts [36-44,46] which show a similar pattern for the dependency of Sn : Pt alloy =1: 1 upon the support, surface area and Sn: Pt ratio. The Pt-Sn alloy is more active for direct six-carbon ring formation than Pt alone. 7. The addition of tin does not decrease the amount of alkyl cyclopentanes formed. Instead, the addition of tin increases the relative rate of alkyl cyclopentane hydrogenolysis to produce iso-alkanes. 5. References [ 1 ] B.H. Davis, U.S. Patent, 3,840,475, October 8, 1974. [2] B.H.

Davis ∗ Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA * Corresponding author. Tin alters the activity and stability of a series of Pt-alumina catalysts. Depending upon the support, dehydrocyclization may occur by a monofunctional metal catalysed pathway or in combination with a bifunctional pathway involving both metal and support. The initial tin added by coimpregnation with Pt is found to decrease the activity of a catalyst based on acidic alumina but to promote the activity of one based on a nonacidic support. When the catalyst based on an acidic alumina contains sufficient tin to eliminate the acidity of the support, and thereby the bifunctional pathway, the activity pattern vs. Sn/Pt ratio for the nonacidic and acidic based catalysts have a similar form. For similar Sn/Pt bulk compositions, a catalyst based upon coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide differs significantly from the one based on an acidic or non-acidic alumina support. The results show that tin may serve (1) to enhance metal dispersion at lower loading, (2) to form a Pt:Sn = 1:1 alloy with a higher dehydrocyclization activity than Pt alone, (3) to modify the aromatics selectivity from the dehydrocyclization of n-octane and (4) to poison acid sites and thereby eliminate the more rapid pathway to produce aromatics.

        "dc:description": "Tin alters the activity and stability of a series of Pt-alumina catalysts. Depending upon the support, dehydrocyclization may occur by a monofunctional metal catalysed pathway or in combination with a bifunctional pathway involving both metal and support. The initial tin added by coimpregnation with Pt is found to decrease the activity of a catalyst based on acidic alumina but to promote the activity of one based on a nonacidic support. When the catalyst based on an acidic alumina contains sufficient tin to eliminate the acidity of the support, and thereby the bifunctional pathway, the activity pattern vs. Sn/Pt ratio for the nonacidic and acidic based catalysts have a similar form. For similar Sn/Pt bulk compositions, a catalyst based upon coprecipitated tin-aluminum oxide differs significantly from the one based on an acidic or non-acidic alumina support. The results show that tin may serve (1) to enhance metal dispersion at lower loading, (2) to form a Pt:Sn = 1:1 alloy with a higher dehydrocyclization activity than Pt alone, (3) to modify the aromatics selectivity from the dehydrocyclization of n-octane and (4) to poison acid sites and thereby eliminate the more rapid pathway to produce aromatics.",
