Graphical abstract d-Orbital steered FeN4 moiety through N, S dual-site adjustation sparks fresh vitality for oxygen reduction reaction in a rechargeable zinc-air flow battery. The implementation of pristine covalent organic polymer (COP) with well-defined structure as air electrode may spark fresh vitality to rechargeable zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs), but it still remains challenges in synergistically regulating their electronic states and structural porosity for the great device performance. Here, we conquer these issues by exploiting N and S co-doped graphene with COP rich in metal–ligand nitrogen to synergistically construct an effective catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, the N and S co-doped sites with high electronegativity properties alter the number of electron occupations in the d orbital of the iron centre and form electron-transfer bridges, thereby boosting the selectivity of the ORR-catalysed four-electron pathway. Meanwhile, the introduction of COP materials aids the formation of pore interstices in the graphene lamellae, which both adequately expose the active sites and facilitate the transport of reactive substances. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, as-prepared catalyst exhibits excellent half-wave potentials (E 1/2 = 912 mV) and stability (merely 8.8% drop after a long-term durability test of 50000 s). Further, ZAFBs assembled with the N/SG@COP catalyst demonstrate exceptional power density (163.8 mW cm−2) and continuous charge and discharge for approximately 140 h at 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the noble-metal benchmarks. Keywords Nitrogen/sulfur dual sites Metal-coordinated nitrogen sites Covalent organic polymer Oxygen reduction reaction Zn-air flow battery 1 Introduction Sustainable Zn-air flow batteries (ZAFBs) are considered promising green energy storage devices for the achievement of carbon neutrality owing to their environmental friendliness, low cost and excellent energy density [1–5]. However, the power output of ZAFBs is significantly restricted by sluggish kinetics, tending to present the inferior performance and life span of the air cathode [6–8]. Developing efficient catalysts is required and urgent to drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that occurs in air cathode, reduce the great overpotential between the actual potential and the thermodynamic equilibrium potential and finally achieve superior voltage output. In the past decade, non-precious metal carbon-based electrocatalysts have exhibited great advantages for their low cost and wide availability of raw materials [9–14]. Numerous studies manifest that nitrogen-coordinated single-atom metal sites (MN4) embedded in carbon (M−N/C) deliver the most active non-precious metal oxygen reduction catalytic performance [15–20]. In decades, a class of naturally enriched N-coordinated metal atoms moieties (i.e., MN4 sites) in fully π-conjugated covalent organic polymer (COP) catalysts have emerged, prepared by the pyrolysis-free method [21–24]. The pristine COP effectively avoids the high temperature-induced structure destruction, overly complex products as well as unclear catalytic active-site configurations (M−N4, M−N2+2 and N-M−N2+2 moieties, etc.) compared to conventional pyrolysis carbon-based catalysts [25–29]. With the atomically precise structure, adjustable skeleton and tunable porosity, the initial COP is regarded as an ideal material platform for the study of electrocatalytic mechanisms [21,30–35]. For example, in recent studies, we developed COP paradigm with closed F edges, where the F-edge competed for electrons with the FeN4 active site, weakening the bonding orbitals between the catalyst and the intermediate, and resulting in a more than 5-fold improvement in the intrinsic catalytic performance of the catalyst. To improve the conductivity of the raw COP to meet device requirements, in another work, a supported COP-based composite electrocatalyst (G@COP) was fabricated by us utilizing highly conductive graphene as scaffold, which greatly exerts the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the intrinsic COP catalyst [36]. Although great progress has been made in a three-electrode system, the device performance of assembled ZAFBs (peak power of ∼120 mW cm−2) with the G@COP catalyst still exists room for performance improvement to meet the practical applications owing to their impediments in controls over mass/charge transfer (microporous property of COPs) and intrinsic activity of the materials [33]. The development of advanced synthetic methods to control the electronic properties and multistage pores in ORR catalysts, especially applied in ZAFBs, is urgently needed but difficult. Engineering electronic structure is considered as a viable strategy to enhance the ORR performance of catalysts [37–40]. Since the apparent electronegativity gap between the carbon atoms and the doped heteroatoms, the additional introduction of heteroatoms with discrepant electronegativity usually alters the charge and spin densities of the carbon atoms in the lattice, optimizing the sorption of active species with oxygen intermediates [41–43]. For example, Li group [44,45] immobilized Cu moiety on N- and S-modified carbon matrix and formed unsymmetrical Cu-S1N3 sites via an atomic interface strategy, which achieves the rational manipulation of the active site configuration towards a well-managed energy level and geometric structure and enhances the ORR performance. Lee group [46] compared the ORR activity of a single FeN4 site by controlling electron-withdrawing/donating properties of a carbon plane with the incorporation of sulfur functionalities and eventually confirmed that incorporated sulfur functionalities of electron-withdrawing oxidized S moiety decreased the d-band center of iron center, reducing the adsorption capacity of FeN4 moiety with oxygen intermediate and promoting ORR kinetics. In this work, we aim to develop high-performance pyrolysis-free COP model catalysts based on electronic structure engineering and multistage pore adjustment for the COP material to meet the functional ZAFBs. Specifically, we exploit melamine (MA) and trithiocyanuric acid (TA) to create N, S co-doped porous graphene with COP rich in metal–ligand nitrogen to synergistically construct an effective catalyst for ORR. The method provides the following advantages: (i) The electron-withdrawing N and S co-doped sites with high electronegativity property greatly promote the electron transfer in the Fe center, causing the decreased number of electron occupations in its d orbital, which attenuates the binding effect between active moiety and the oxygen intermediate, thus significantly improving the four-electron transferred ORR catalytic activity and selectivity [47,48]. (ii) MA and AA serve as N and S sources meanwhile are facile to volatilize and produce a porous structure, enhancing the specific surface area, the exposure of active sites as well as mass-transfer pores. (iii) The N/SG@COP creates electron transfer channels between the FeN4 sites and the excellent N/SG conductive substrates, which further facilitates the ability of electrons to conduct and the stability of the compound. Excitingly, the as-synthesized N/SG@COP exhibits a superior performance with the half-wave potential of 0.912 V (vs. RHE), more ahead of 204, 44, and 60 mV than the counterpart N/SG (without FeN4 sites), G@COP without N, S co-doped sites and 20% commercial Pt/C. Besides, ZAFBs assembled with N/SG@COP catalyst deliver a superior power density (163.8 mW cm−2), and charge and discharge continuously approaching 140 h at 10 mA cm−2, preponderantly exceeding that of the benchmark Pt/C and G@COP. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of COP The COP with enriched FeN4 sites was prepared using the microwave method, as described in our previous work [49]. Typically, the benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarbonitrile (BTC) monomer (400 mg), FeCl3·6H2O (200 mg) and DBU (200 μL) were dissolved in the mixed solution including 2 mL DMF and 18 mL ethylene glycol. Afterwards, the mixture was reacted in a Discover SP-microwave reactor at 180 °C for 15 min. After cooling, the mixture was centrifuged and washed sequentially with HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1) and deionised water to neutrality. The final COP was prepared by drying at 60 °C overnight. 2.2 Synthesis of N/SG Graphene (100 mg) was hydrothermally reacted with MA (0.125 g) and TA (0.180 g) in an oil at 80 °C for 10 min, and then transferred to a Teflon reactor to react 12 h at 180 °C. Under N2 protection, the precursor reacted at 320 °C for 2 h, and then heated up to a certain temperature for 2 h reaction in a tubular furnace. Depending on the material required, the certain temperatures were established as 650, 750, 850 and 950 °C, respectively. After the freeze drying, the N/SG was finally obtained. 2.3 Synthesis of NG and SG For the control experiments, the synthesis procedures for NG and SG were similar to those of N/SG, except that NG lacked the TA in the reactants while SG lacked the MA. 2.4 Synthesis of N/SG@COP Firstly, 30 mg N/SG and 30 mg COP were dissolved in 30 mL DMF solution. Then, the mixture was reacted in a Teflon reactor at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mol L−1 HCl was added to the mixture, and then sonicated for 30 min. Finally, the N/SG@COP was obtained by centrifugation, cleaning with ethanol and deionised water, and freeze-drying, successively. 2.5 Synthesis of G@COP, NG@COP and SG@COP For the control experiments, the synthesis procedures for G@COP, NG@COP and SG@COP were similar to those of N/SG@COP, except that G@COP, NG@COP and SG@COP replaced N/SG with graphene, NG and SG, respectively. 2.6 Electrochemical evaluation All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell by utilising CHI760E electrochemical workstation. In this case, a carbon rod and a saturated calomel electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was glass-carbon rotating disk electrode (5 mm diameter, PINE Instrument Inc) coated with catalysts. Electrode potentials were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), following the formula (E RHE = E SCE + Eθ (Hg/HgCl) + 0.059 pH). 2.7 Formulation of the catalyst ink The prepared catalyst (5 mg) was incorporated into a mixture of ethanol (950 μL) and Nafion (0.5 wt.%, 50 μL) followed by sonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous suspension. Afterwards, the obtained suspension (15 μL) was decorated on the surface of glass-carbon electrode with a loading of about 0.382 mg cm−2. 2.8 Assembly of rechargeable ZAFBs The rechargeable ZAFBs were assembled from air cathode, anode, electrolyte and cyclic peristaltic pump. In this case, a polished Zn plate (0.5 mm thick) was utilized for the anode, while the hydrophobic gas diffusion layer and the hydrophilic catalyst layer were bonded through thermocompression to act as an air cathode. The electrolyte was 6.0 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution containing 0.20 mol L−1 Zn (CH3COO)2. At a loading mass of 1.5 mg cm−2, the N/SG@COP catalyst was dripped onto carbon paper. Conversely, G@COP, 20% Pt/C and IrO2 were also loaded with 1.5 mg cm−2 each. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Fabrication of N/SG@COP catalyst As shown in Fig. 1 , we initially synthesized the N/SG substrate through the pyrolysis of graphene, MA and TA. During the pyrolysis process, MA and TA acted as the nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) sources, respectively, resulting in the creation of N and S co-doped sites within the graphene matrix. The raw COP catalyst, which contains enriched and ordered N-coordinated Fe single atom centers (FeN4 moieties), was synthesized using the microwave synthesis method described in our previous work [49]. Specifically, the BTC monomer coordinated with the Fe atom, self-polymerized, and formed a fully closed π-conjugated COP network with FeN4 moieties. The successful synthesis of the quasi-phthalocyanine COP skeleton was confirmed by characteristic peaks observed at 169.7 and 144.5 ppm in the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, corresponding to the carbon atoms of the newly formed imine linkages (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Additionally, characteristic peaks in the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR, Supporting Information Fig. S2) appeared at approximately 1111, 1384, and 1710 cm−1, indicating the successful construction of the macrocyclic structure of phthalocyanine in COP (Fig. 1). After a 12-hour hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C, the FeN4 active sites in COP fully combined with the N/SG substrate. Through a series of experiments, we confirmed that FeN4 active sites may be riveted and coordinated with N or S dual sites to maximize the synergistic interaction between the MN4 sites and the N and S dual sites. Through morphology observation in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization towards the prepared catalysts (Fig. 2 a and Supporting Information Fig. S3), a distinct porous structure emerged on the surface of the initially smooth and wrinkled carbon substrate upon its combination with the COP network. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of N/SG@COP exhibits a clear fusion of the folded graphene structure with a dendrite-like COP skeleton (Fig. 2b). The presence of C, O, N, S, and Fe element in the elemental distribution scan (EDS) image confirmed the successful synthesis of N/SG@COP and multielement doping (Fig. 2c). In the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), the bright dots represent Fe atoms, which are abundantly and evenly dispersed in the image, symbolizing the abundance of Fe atoms uniformly dispersed in the N/SG@COP in monatomic form (Fig. 2d). X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Supporting Information Fig. S4) demonstrate that the diffraction peak of N/SG@COP exhibited a greater bias towards the small angle direction compared to that of N/SG. Based on the Bragg equation (2d sinθ = nλ), it can be hypothesized that the interaction with COP possibly resulted in a modification of the lattice constant in the N/SG@COP catalyst [50]. Subsequently, in combination with the measured FT-IR data (Fig. 2e), we found that the composite harbored a well-defined COP structure. The weakening of cyano group at the edge position (2233.3 cm−1) originating from the BTC monomer indicates that the COP material has undergone complete polymerization [51,52] which embodies the advantages of the pyrolysis-free strategy in terms of precise and controllable structure. For N/SG@COP, the prominent N–H (3432 cm−1) characteristic peak attributable to the abundant N sites in N/SG, which is also evidence the successful combination of COP with N/SG in as-prepared N/SG@COP compound. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns of the synthetic material were performed and analyzed to investigate the coordination environment and chemical state of the materials. The Fe 2p XPS spectra shown in Fig. 2(f) are deconvoluted into the Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 species at ca. 710.3 and 723.1 eV for iron species, respectively [34,53]. Significantly, we observe an obvious positive shift to higher binding energy for the main the Fe 2p peaks in N/SG@COP compared to initial COP, suggesting that the coordination of Fe center on the COP network combined with the doped N and S atoms on the carbon substrate alters the charge density around the Fe sites, resulting in a positive shift of their binding energy of iron atom. High-resolution XPS spectrum (Supporting Information Figs. S5–S8) reveals distinctive peaks attributed to Fe-N (398.1 eV), pyridine N (398.6 eV), pyrrole N (399.8 eV), and graphitic N (401.7 eV) structures [54,55], supporting the formation of different nitrogen-containing functionalities within N/SG@COP. Comparing the N 1s XPS spectra of COP and N/SG@COP, it is evident that the binding energy of Fe-N in N/SG@COP changes and shifts positively to a higher binding energy compared to that of COP sample (Supporting Information Fig. S9). The result matches the binding energy data for Fe 2p (Fig. 2f), demonstrating that the introduction of N/SG significantly alters the charge environment around the Fe sites of COP. Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p provides evidence for the presence of C-S moieties (S 2p 3/2 located at 163.5 eV and S 2p 1/2 located at 164.7 eV). Combined with the elemental quantification of COP, N/SG and N/SG@COP (Supporting Information Table S1), the data confirms the successful formation of the COP network with nitrogen and sulfur species. In addition, the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis of catalysts further delves the structure and chemical state of Fe atom. The Extended XAFS (EXAFS) fitting results indicate that the coordination number of Fe-N is about 3.89 ± 0.32 (Supporting Information Table S2). In Supporting Information Figs. S10 and S11, there is a significant discrepancy between the EXAFS data of N/SG@COP and Fe foil, indicating that Fe–Fe bonding is nearly ignored in N/SG@COP catalysts. And the EXAFS data for N/SG@COP and FePc are relatively similar, which demonstrates that Fe atoms are primarily present as FeN4 in the N/SG@COP catalyst. Subsequently, Raman spectra of the N/SG and N/S@COP samples were measured to identify the defect and graphitization degree in as-prepared N/S@COP (Supporting Information Fig. S12). It is evident that all the spectra display two prominent peaks, the D peak and G peak, located at approximately 1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. The D peak signifies the presence of defects in the carbon atom lattice, while the G peak corresponds to in-plane stretching vibrations of the sp 2 hybridization in the carbon atoms. The higher I D/I G value of N/S@COP (I D/I G = 1.15) compared to G@COP indicates that the introduction of MA and TA greatly increases the degree of defects in the carbon matrix in the catalyst. Furthermore, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) was conducted to get deep insight into the structural characteristics and the mass-transport performance of as-synthesized catalysts (Fig. 2g–i and Supporting Information Fig. S13). In particular, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for COP, N/SG, and N/SG@COP samples all exhibited type IV curves. Comparatively, the specific surface area of N/SG@COP (352.24 m2 g−1) was significantly higher than that of pure COP (43.34 m2 g−1) and N/SG (189.71 m2 g−1), indicating the presence of abundant porous structures in N/SG@COP after combination with N, S co-doped graphene for initial COP catalyst. Besides, the corresponding pore size distribution and pore volume in N/SG@COP also outperformed those of single COP and N/SG, which contributes to the maximum exposure of ORR active sites and thus enhances the mass transfer performance. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance test The ORR catalytic performance of the synthesized materials and commercial 20% Pt/C was evaluated in a 0.1 mol L−1 O2-saturated KOH electrolyte using a conventional three-electrode test system. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Fig. 3 (a) revealed that N/SG exhibited weak catalytic performance, with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.71 V vs. RHE and a lower limiting current density (J L). However, upon combining the COP network with N/SG through π-π self-assembly and riveting of doped N, S atoms with Fe centers, the abundant N and S doping sites adjusted the electronic structure and coordination environment of the FeN4 active sites, resulting in a significant improvement in performance for N/SG@COP. The E 1/2 of N/SG@COP reached 0.912 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of G@COP without N and S doping sites (E 1/2 = 0.85 V vs. RHE) as well as the 20% commercial Pt/C (E 1/2 = 0.86 V vs. RHE). Additionally, the Tafel slope of N/SG@COP (43.91 mV dec−1) and the kinetic current density (J k) were significantly higher than those of the other catalysts, indicating an accelerated ORR kinetic process after the N and S dual-site doping in the graphene matrix (Fig. 3a–c and Supporting Information Fig. S14). An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and the corresponding turnover frequency (TOF) were analyzed to quantify the intrinsic ORR activity. In the N/SG@COP samples, the abundance of Fe sites (1.87 wt.%) was observed in Supporting Information Table S3. The TOF of N/SG@COP catalyst (50.84 s−1) significantly enhanced (Supporting Information Fig. S15), which was almost 2.4 times higher than that of intrinsic COP (22.82 s−1), quantitatively demonstrating the improved electrocatalytic activity of N/SG@COP. These results firmly confirm that the synergistic effect between the N/S co-doped matrix structure and FeN4 sites greatly contributes to the enhancement of catalytic activity. Subsequently, the number of electron transfers (n) and the HO2 − yield for the ORR catalytic process were determined using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) and calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2). The results demonstrated that N/SG@COP followed a four-electron catalytic reaction pathway. The yield of HO2 − was found to be less than 4% for both N/SG@COP and the 20% Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 3d and Supporting Information Fig. S16). (1) n = ( 4 × I d ) / I d + I r / N (2) H O 2 - % = 200 × I r / N / I r / N + I d Where I d and I r represent disc current and ring current, respectively. N is generally taken as 0.37. Meanwhile, stability is a crucial criterion for evaluating the durability of catalysts in practical applications. After a constant potential test of 50,000 s, the current density of N/SG@COP only decayed by 8.8%, which is significantly lower than that of the 20% Pt/C catalyst (which experienced a drastic drop of almost 20%, as shown in Fig. 3e). Through theoretical calculation, we found that the doping N, S sites results in trapping of the FeN4 sites of the COP network into N, S doped graphene, which may enhance the stability of the formed overall structure. Furthermore, we also compared the ORR catalytic performance of N/SG@COP with other reported carbon-based catalysts in the domestic and foreign researches, as shown in Supporting Information Table S4. The results revealed that the performance of the designed N/SG@COP catalysts surpasses that of most reported carbon-based catalysts, further confirming that the successful construction of N and S-doped carbon in synergy with MN4 moieties greatly enhances the ORR catalytic performance. Additionally, the electrochemical active specific surface area (ECSA) was measured to determine the effective active area of the reaction (Supporting Information Figs. S17–S19). It is evident that N/SG@COP exhibited the largest ECSA, reaching 170.1 m2 g−1, which is much superior than that of N/SG and COP alone. To verify the stability of the catalyst, the accredited degradation test (ADT) experiments by comparing the LSV curves before and after 10,000 CV cycles in 0.1 mol L−1 N2-saturated KOH solutions. After 10,000 cycles of CV testing, the change in ORR performance of N/SG@COP was almost negligible, demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic performance of the N/SG@COP (Fig. 3f). And the structure of the catalysts before and after the ADT tests was characterized by TEM to observe whether the structure of the materials changes. Comparing the TEM images of the catalyst before (Fig. 2b) and after (Supporting Information Fig. S20) the test, it is evident that the structure of the catalyst basically remains unchanged, where the folded graphene and COP structures are still compounded intact. The results demonstrate the excellent stability of the N/SG@COP catalyst. 3.3 ZAFBs performance evaluation Furthermore, N/SG@COP was employed as an air cathode catalyst to assemble the homemade ZAFBs, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). The ZAFBs demonstrated a greater discharge peak power density (163.8 mW cm−2) compared to the G@COP catalyst (123 mW cm−2) and 20% Pt/C catalyst (117.1 mW cm−2) at the same loading (Fig. 4b). As depicted in Supporting Information Fig. S21, the open-circuit voltage of the N/SG@COP-driven ZAFBs reached up to 1.41 eV, indicating a strong energy storage capacity and the ability to deliver sufficient power. Furthermore, the open-circuit voltage remained relatively stable after resting in the KOH electrolyte for 14 h, which also provided a guarantee for the continuous operation of the ZAFBs. The ZAFBs with the N/SG@COP cathode exhibited a specific capacity 800.2 mA h gZn −1 (Fig. 4c), close to the theoretical capacity of 821 mA h gZn −1, which indicated that the designed ZAFBs were competent to carry a desirable charge [56,57]. Subsequently, galvanostatic discharging-charging experiments were conducted at different current densities (5, 10 and 20 mA cm−2) to evaluate the rate performance of the ZAFBs assembled with N/SG@COP, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Each galvanostatic discharging-charging cycle lasted for 30 min. Remarkably, the rate-performance experiments showed only minor changes occurring after four consecutive alternating cycles (voltage stable at 1.221 V, 1.128 V, and 1.012 V with current densities of 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−2, respectively). This convincingly demonstrates the outstanding tolerance of ZAFBs assembled with N/SG@COP during battery operation. Furthermore, the long-term durability of the N/SG@COP electrocatalyst was evaluated through galvanostatic cycling of the ZAFBs at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4e). The ZAFBs assembled with N/SG@COP operated continuously for 140 h, equivalent to 280 charge–discharge cycles, significantly outperforming the counterpart Pt/C catalyst (90 h and 180 charge–discharge cycles). Compared the performance of our N/SG@COP-based ZAFBs with recently reported ZAFBs (Supporting Information Table S5), the data indicate that our N/SG@COP-based ZAFBs outperform most ZAFBs assembled with other non-precious metal catalysts. The satisfactory power density and long-term durability of ZAFBs assembled with N/SG@COP illustrate the valuable usage and application prospects of the N/SG@COP catalyst in green energy storage devices. 3.4 DFT mechanism study To further explore the rationale for the excellent performance of the catalysts, we performed density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the theoretical model to gain insight into the synergistic effect between the FeN4 sites of the COP network and N, S co-doped sites. Supporting Information Fig. S22 shows the calculated the theoretical models for NG, SG and N/SG. Several carbon atoms with large charges were highlighted. Among different models, the C1 atom possessed the largest charge owing to the induced charge redistribution and localization after N, S co-doping into graphene. The N, S co-doping sites significantly altered the charge environment of the surrounding carbon atoms compared to G@COP. Differential charge density analysis (Fig. 5 a) manifest that COP offers the monoatomic coordination centers, and is induced to transfer to the N/SG, generating a Fe-N/S electron channel, which alters the electron state of active FeN4 sites. As we can see from the total density of state (TDOS) graph, after the COP network interacted with N/SG through π-π self-assembly, the TDOS plot of N/SG@COP more approaches the Fermi level, which manifests the enhanced electric conductivity (Supporting Information Fig. S23) [39]. Partial density of states (pDOS, Fig. 5b) analysis was further conducted to reveal the effect between metal centers and doped N and S sites in the substrate in NG@COP, SG@COP and N/SG@COP, as well as their interaction with absorbed oxygen. The interaction between metal Fe atoms and oxygen species primarily arises from the 2p orbitals in oxygen and 3d orbitals in Fe. The unoccupied d orbitals of the COP accept electrons from the 3σ, 1π and 1π* orbitals of absorbed oxygen, forming bonding orbitals that strengthen the adsorption and bonding with oxygen [21,58]. Simultaneously, the occupied d orbitals of COP donate electrons to the 1π* antibonding orbitals of oxygen, which are located far away from the Fermi level. This donation weakens the bonding to oxygen. Therefore, the strength of the bond primarily depends on the number of occupied bonding orbitals in the absorbed oxygen [59]. However, after the introduction of N, S co-doped sites in the COP skeleton, the interaction between the metal and the oxygen intermediate is reduced. The N, S co-doped sites have certain electron-withdrawing effects, which decrease the affinity between the metal sites and oxygen intermediates. This decrease in affinity lowers the energy barrier during OH* desorption, leading to improved catalytic performance. Corresponding Gibbs free energy diagrams were plotted, as shown in Supporting Information Figs. S24–S30 and Fig. 5(c). Except for the initial COP, the rate-determining step (RDS) of the other COP models (NG@COP, SG@COP and N/SG@COP) remained consistent, corresponding to the desorption of OH* intermediates. Among these, the limiting reaction potential energy barrier, i.e., overpotential, of N/SG@COP was the lowest (0.536 V) among all catalysts, demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to analyze the work function (Ø) and valence bands (VB) of G@COP and N/SG@COP (Supporting Information Fig. S31). Compared to the pristine G@COP, the position of valence band level was far away from that of the fermi level with the introduction of N and S atoms (Fig. 5d), demonstrating that the d orbital energy level position of the material shifts downwards away from the Fermi energy level. That result is consistent with the pDOS data (Fig. 5b). In order to quantify the orbital splitting or electron filling of Fe atoms in the catalyst after the introduction of N and S atoms, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) calculations were performed (Fig. 5e and f). It is discovered that COP interacts with oxygen and orbital splitting into 2σ*, 3σ, 1π and 1π*. Interestingly, the quantitative integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) analyses indicate that the values of -ICOHP become smaller after the introduction of N, S sites into graphene matrix. It demonstrates that the bonding of Fe active center with oxygen in COP decreases after the introduction of N, S atoms. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, an efficient N, S co-doping graphene hybrid with FeN4 moieties (N/SG@COP) was designed for ZAFBs availability. The doped N and S sites alter the charge environment of the metal iron atom in COP. Meanwhile, the introduction of COP also contributes to the formation of abundant pore channels, allowing for maximum exposure of the active sites. The experimental results demonstrate that the electrochemical active area of N/SG@COP is significantly enhanced and exhibits excellent oxygen reduction properties (E onset = 1.04 V vs. RHE, E 1/2 = 912 mV) and favorable stability (only 8.8% drop after 50000 s). Beneficial to excellent ORR catalysis activity, N/SG@COP was assembled into the rechargeable ZAFBs as cathode catalyst, which exhibited superior ORR catalytic performance (the power density was 163.8 mW cm−2 and the charge/discharge stability up to 140 h), far beyond that of commercial platinum-based catalysts (117.1 mW cm−2) and counterpart G@COP (123.0 mW cm−2). The presented strategy extends the performance tuning of atomically precise M−N/C catalysts in terms of electronic structure and pore architecture for multiple green energy storage related applications.

        "dc:description": "The implementation of pristine covalent organic polymer (COP) with well-defined structure as air electrode may spark fresh vitality to rechargeable zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs), but it still remains challenges in synergistically regulating their electronic states and structural porosity for the great device performance. Here, we conquer these issues by exploiting N and S co-doped graphene with COP rich in metal–ligand nitrogen to synergistically construct an effective catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, the N and S co-doped sites with high electronegativity properties alter the number of electron occupations in the d orbital of the iron centre and form electron-transfer bridges, thereby boosting the selectivity of the ORR-catalysed four-electron pathway. Meanwhile, the introduction of COP materials aids the formation of pore interstices in the graphene lamellae, which both adequately expose the active sites and facilitate the transport of reactive substances. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, as-prepared catalyst exhibits excellent half-wave potentials (E 1/2 = 912 mV) and stability (merely 8.8% drop after a long-term durability test of 50000 s). Further, ZAFBs assembled with the N/SG@COP catalyst demonstrate exceptional power density (163.8 mW cm−2) and continuous charge and discharge for approximately 140 h at 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the noble-metal benchmarks.",
