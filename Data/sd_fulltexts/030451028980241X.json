LIETTI, E. TRONCONI, P. FORZATTI Dipartimento di Chimica Industrials e Ingegneria Chimica del Politecniw, P.zza L. Da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan (Italy) and G. BUSCA Istituto di Chimica, Facolta di Ingegneria, Universita di Geneva, Genoa (Italy) Summary Aspects of the mechanism involved in the synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols from syngas have been investigated by combined FT-IR spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) tech- niques. Results concerning the interaction of 64 linear oxygenated molecules with ZnO-based catalysts have been interpreted on the basis of a mechanistic scheme demonstrating a number of catalytic functions. Some of the related reactions are characteristic of base-catalyzed organic chemistry in solution: aldolic-type condensation, aldehyde disproportionation, ketonization, decar- boxylation and dehydrogenation. By comparison with catalytic activity data under actual reaction conditions, it is found that the same functions also play an important role in determining the spectrum of products of the synthesis, although the relative relevance of the associated chemical reactions is altered by the different operating conditions as well as by thermodynamic constraints. Introduction Temperature programmed techniques have become widely used as a tool for studying the interaction of gaseous chemical compounds with solid surfaces in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the applications of Tempera- ture Programmed Desorption and/or Reaction to mechanistic investigations are still scarce, even though they appear well suited for gaining independent information on the nature of the intermediate species and on the catalyst functions involved in complex chemical reactions, particularly when comple- mented by surface spectroscopy data. *This is Paper XIX in the series 'Synthesis of Alcohols from Carbon Oxides and Hydrogen'. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 44 Very little has been reported on the mechanism of the Higher Alcohol Synthesis (HAS) over alkali-promoted high-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts, consisting of mixed oxides of Cr, Zn and/or Mn [I], though such systems appear of relevant industrial interest [2]. We have addressed the mechanistic features of the HAS over ZnO-based catalysts by using FT-IR and Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) techniques, which allow the interaction of appropriate intermediate species with the catalyst surface to be investigated and provide indications on the mechanism of specific reactions operating under HAS, thus reducing the overall complexity of the problem: over 100 compounds have been identified in a typical product mixture [3, 4]. Linear 64 oxygenates (n-butanal, butan-1-ol and n-butanoic acid) have been selected as probe molecules for a study of the mechanism of chain growth to primary alcohols in order to reduce the number of reaction products [5,6]. TPSR runs with carrier gas consisting of both He and He + oxygenates were performed. In the following, we first present the results of FT-IR and TPSR experiments. In a subsequent section, these data are reconciled with results obtained during flow reactor runs under actual synthesis conditions over Zn-Cr-0 catalysts. Experimental Transmission/absorption FT-IR spectra were recorded by a Nicolet 5ZDX instrument, using a conventional Pyrex glass cell. Pressed disks of the pure ZnO powder were activated under vacuum at 365 C. Diffuse Reflectance IR (DRIFT) spectra were recorded using a Spectratech 'The Collector' attach- ment and a home-made Pyrex glass heatable/evacuable cell, using the same pretreatment as for transmittance spectra. The TPSR apparatus and the related experimental procedures have been described elsewhere [5]. In TPSR runs with 64 oxygenates added to the carrier gas, a part of the He stream was saturated by passing it through liquid n-butanal or butan-1-ol kept at con- stant temperature. Three catalyst samples were considered in the present study. The TPSR measurements and DRIFT spectra were performed on a commercial Zn-Cr-0 catalyst (Zn/Cr atomic ratio = 3/1; detected phases: ZnO + ZnCra04) as well as on a similar sample impregnated with 3 w/ w% KgO. FT IR transmittance spectra were recorded using a pure ZnO powder (A-Esse; Carasco, Genoa). Results FT-IR spectroscopy The commercial Zn-Cr-0 sample was found to contain an excessive particle size, preventing the performance of transmittance IR experiments. Therefore, transmittance experiments were performed using ZnO powder. 46 However, DRIFT spectra were also recorded on the Zn-Cr-0 sample in order to check that the IR results obtained with ZnO could be extended to the commercial catalyst. In Fig. 1(A), the spectra of the surface species arising from n-butanal adsorbed on ZnO at room temperature (r.t.) and following evacuation at increasing temperatures are presented. The baseline drift is due to a partial reduction of ZnO upon evacuation treatment. The spectrum recorded after evacuation at r.t. already shows the existence of at least three different adsorbed species. The band at 1705 cm\"1 is assigned to v(C=0) of an ad- sorbed aldehyde. The shoulder at 1693 cm\"1 may be due to another adsorbed aldehyde, or to another adsorbed form of the same aldehyde. The bands at 1550 and 1435 cm\"! are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of carboxylate groups. The relatively strong bands near 1190, 1150 and 1100 cm\"1, not present in the spectrum of the free aldehyde, are probably due to v(C 0) of a dioxybutylidene species, by analogy with the spectra of dioxymethylene species [7]. Other bands, such as those near 1460 and 1380cm-1, and those in the region 3000-2800cm-1 (not reported in the figure), are common to the different adsorbed species (C H deformations and stretchings of the aliphatic chain). The changes in the spectra on increasing the evacuation temperature may be interpreted as follows: (i) all adsorbed forms of aldehydes (chemisorbed aldehydes and dioxybutylidene) have al- ready disappeared almost completely at 100 C; (ii) carboxylate species in- crease up to 200 C, are stable up to 300 C, and completely disappear between 300 and 365 C. A second experiment [Fig. 1(B)] has been performed exposing ZnO to the aldehyde vapour (2 Torr) for 2 h at r.t. After evacuation at r.t., the spectrum shows very intense bands due to carboxylates. However, such bands are now more complex: two components at 1580 and 1415 cm~1 have become 1800 1600 1400 1200 WAV EN UMBER (cm-') WAVENUMBER (cm') Fig. 1.

(2 Torr, 2 h contact) followed by evacuation at: (a) r.t.; and (b) 300 C, 2min. 46 more apparent. Evacuation at 300 C causes the disappearance of both the new bands, leaving only those at 1550 and 1435 cm~1 as in the original experiment. This is interpreted by assuming that two distinct forms of carboxylate species may be generated; one is enhanced by prolonged contact with aldehyde vapour, and decomposes rapidly (bands at 1580 and 1415 cm\"1), while the other is formed immediately, and is more resistant to heat treat- ment (bands at 1550 and 1435cm\"1). Taking into account the small vibra- tional shift and intensity variations due to the different optical phenomena involved in diffuse reflectance experiments with respect to the transmission/ absorption ones, the DRIFT spectrum of n-butanal adsorbed on Zn-Cr-0 at r.t. was found to be quite consistent with that discussed above for n-butanal adsorbed on ZnO, confirming that the IR measurements on ZnO are represen- tative of the situation on the surface of Zn-Cr-0 also. IR transmission spectra of the surface species after adsorption of butan- l-ol on ZnO at r.t. and evacuation at increasing temperatures were also recorded. The main adsorbed species at r.t. is characterized by a strong band at 1080 cm\"! typical ofv(C 0) ofalkoxide species [8]. This species desorbs or decomposes between r.t. and 200 C, giving rise to carboxylate species that again disappear between 300 and 365 C. Similar experiments of adsorption/ desorption of n-butanoic acid indicate that the acid is in part adsorbed as such at r.t. (this species disappears upon evacuation even at r.t.), while two forms of carboxylates, similar to those observed with n-butanal, are detected. The species characterized by a greater difference between the asymmetric and the symmetric COO stretching frequencies disappears more rapidly, as in the case of n-butanal. Carboxylates are no longer detected upon evacuation above 300 C. TPSR with He as the carrier gas Figure 2 shows the overall FID-TPSR curve of n-butanal on the Zn-Cr- 0 catalyst, along with the desorption profiles of the main detected species [5, 6]. In the low-temperature region (35 s$ T ^ 200 C) the major products were 2-ethylhexen-2-al, n-butanal, butan-1-ol and heptan-4-one. Cg dienes evolved around 250 C, whereas linear olefins, propylene, butenes and heptan-4-one contributed to the high-temperature peak of the TPSR trace. GC analysis of the desorbed products by a TC detector indicated that COg is also evolved in correspondence to the high-temperature peak. TPSR runs with butan-1-ol [6, 9] and n-butanoic acid [6,10] generated less composite desorption spectra. During TPSR of butan-1-ol the main products were butan-1-ol at low temperatures and propylene (+CO^) in the high-temperature region; only traces of 4. compounds were desorbed. The evolution of butan-1-ol was characterized by the broad shape of the desorp- tion profile extending over 200 C. In the case of the TPSR of n-butanoic acid, only the parent molecule was desorbed below 250 C, while heptan-4-one and propylene were the main products detected above 300 C, along with COg. Notably, the peak temperatures for CgHe evolution were equal (TM = 380 C) in the TPSR of n-butanal, butan-1-ol and n-butanoic acid. However, the peak 47 f, 9 \\- 100 200 300 ^.00 Temperature (\"C) Fig. 2.

TPSR with oxygenates added to the carrier gas stream Figure 3 shows the evolution with temperature of the main species detected during TPSR of n-butanal, pre-adsorbed on the Zn-Cr-0 catalyst, into a carrier gas consisting of He + n-butanal. A comparison with the TPSR results of Fig. 2 indicates that the presence of n-butanal in the carrier gas does not change the nature of the desorbed species. However, their relative amounts are modified, the significant increase in the gas-phase concentration of n-butanal enhancing the formation of 2-ethylhexen-2-al and of heptan-4- one. The concentration of n-butanal in the carrier gas begins to drop in correspondence to the onset of heptan-4-one desorption. Figure 4 presents the results of the same experiment performed on a Zn-Cr-0 catalyst doped with 3 w/w% KgO. The addition of K does not affect the low-temperature region to a significant extent but results in the desorption of greater amounts of heptan-4-one and of much smaller amounts of propylene and olefins, respectively. The amounts of two more compounds, viz. pentanone and toluene, are also enhanced. An additional TPSR experiment was performed with butan-1-ol, pre- adsorbed on a Zn-Cr-0 + 3 w/w% KgO catalyst, desorbing into a stream of He + butan-1-ol. Only butan-1-ol was detected in the carrier gas in the 48 in I in UJ cc. Q TEMPERATURE (\"O Fig. 3.

At co. 200 C, butan-1-ol began to drop in concentration, and the formation of n-butanal was detected. From this point onwards, the situation resembled that of the TPSR of n-butanal in n-butanal-containing carrier gas, already presented in Fig. 4. Discussion Mechanistic interpretation A general reaction pattern which agrees with the major features of the FT-IR and TPSR data is given in Fig. 5. The evolution of alcohol, aldehyde and acid at low temperatures is associated with the desorption of the corresponding molecularly coordinated species. In the case of the TPSR of butan-1-ol, the broad shape of the alcohol 49 LU in 0 Q. in LU CC 0 200 300 400 TEMPERATURE ( C) Fig. 4.

Symbols and conditions as in Fig. 3. desorption curve agrees with the existence of both a molecularly adsorbed alcohol and an alkoxide species, in line with the IR data concerning the dissociative adsorption of butan-1-ol leading to the alkoxide (II) in Fig. 5. Dehydration of such a species probably accounts for the desorption of butenes in the high-temperature region. Desorption of butan-1-ol and of butenes is also observed during the TPSR of n-butanal. Here, the alkoxide species (II) is possibly formed from the molecularly adsorbed aldehyde, either by reduction by hydrogen adsorbed during catalyst pretreatment or via a disproportionation reaction involving the dioxybutylidene intermediate (III) detected by IR spectroscopy. TPSR data have already indicated the formation of 2-ethylhexen-2-al at r.t., as the direct product of the crotonic condensation of n-butanal. The splitting of the v(C==0) band observed by the IR spectroscopy after n-butanal adsorption may be due to the co-presence of n-butanal and 2-ethylhexen-2-al. In line with the reaction scheme proposed in Fig. 5, the condensation of n-butanal to 2-ethylhexen-2-al is greatly favoured by raising the gas-phase butan-1-ol It CaH^-CH^OH ^ 11 (I) CaH^-CHp ^) - f (11) -H^O butenes n-butanal CaH^-CH-CH-CHO ^ OH C^Hs ^^ (VII) '+C3H7-CHO C3H7 CHO; > propylene n-butanoic acid (IV^, ^ /-co. tl 2-ethylhexen-2-al C^-CH^ ^J ^ C3H7-COO (^ < C3H7-COOH ^) 0 (III) (V) (VI) +C3Hr-COOH I -H^O C3H7-C==C-COO ^) OH C^Hs (IX) olefins [C3H7-CH-CH-COO /^ OH CzHs (vni) Fig. 5. Proposed reaction pathways of linear oxygenates. 51 concentration of the 64 aldehyde, as effected in the experiments of Figs. 3 and 4. IR experiments have suggested the formation of two distinct carboxy- late species characterized by different thermal stabilities. In TPSR experi- ments, the desorption of heptan-4-one and of 67 olefins, and that of propylene occurring at slightly higher temperatures, is in fact attributed to the decar- boxylation of Cg and carboxylic surface species, respectively. The peak temperatures for the evolution of Cy olefins, Cy ketones and propylene are consistent with the temperature threshold corresponding to the disappear- ance of the carboxylate species in the IR experiments (above 300 C). The formation of the carboxylate ion (V) is hypothesized to occur either from the molecularly adsorbed aldehyde (IV) by reaction with surface oxide anions, or from the dioxybutylidene species (III) via the disproportion- ation reaction already proposed for the formation of alkoxide species (II). Decarboxylation of (V) explains the simultaneous desorption of propylene and CC>2 observed in the TPSR of n-butanal. As mentioned above, desorption of Cg Hg + CC>2 also occurs at the same temperature during TPSR of n- butanoic acid and of butan-1-ol, indicating that the same mechanism, con- trolled by the decomposition of species (V), is involved in this process, no matter what the nature of the molecule originally adsorbed on the catalyst. In the case of the TPSR of n-butanoic acid, the carboxylate ion (V) is formed directly by dissociative adsorption, whereas a transformation of the alkoxide species (II) into the carboxylate ion is probably involved in the TPSR of butan-1-ol. IR experiments show that the alkoxide species begins to react at temperatures where the aldehyde is already rapidly converted to carboxy- lates. This explains why 2-ethylhexen-2-al, olefins and Cy ketones, which arise from aldehyde species, were not observed during the TPSR of butan-1-ol. The presence of n-butanal in the gas phase has been found to promote the formation of heptan-4-one, but not that of C^ olefins. Accordingly, two distinct routes are probably involved in the desorption of these two compounds. The main route to olefins in TPSR is believed to involve decarboxylation of the intermediate surface species (XI), originating from oxidation of the molecularly adsorbed Cg aldehyde (X). IR data confirm the existence of a carboxylate species favoured by gas-phase n-butanal, which can be identified with species (XI) according to the scheme in Fig. 5. Heptan-4-one desorption is attributed to dehydrogenation-decarboxylation of intermediate (VIII), resulting from condensation of a n-butanal molecule with the carboxylate species (V), in line with literature suggestions [11]. This route is consistent with the increase in heptan-4-one evolution observed in the presence of n-butanal in the carrier gas stream. Dehydration-decarboxy- lation of species (VIII) to C-, olefins is believed to be of minor relevance in our catalytic system, at least in the absence of n-butanal in the gas phase. On studying condensation reactions of carbonyl compounds with carboxylic acids over oxide catalysts, Pillai and coworkers have observed that the predominant reaction products are either olefins or ketones, depending on whether acidic (e.g. AlyOg [11]) or basic (e.g. ThOg [12]) catalysts are used. In 52 fact, a comparison between Figs. 2 and 3 indicates that in TPSR runs with n-butanal added to the carrier gas, impregnation of Zn-Cr-0 with K increases the formation of heptan-4-one and reduces that of 67 olefins. As reported above, heptan-4-one desorption occurs at different tempera- tures during the TPSR of n-butanal and n-butanoic acid. In fact, according to Fig. 5, heptan-4-one originates from species (IX) in the TPSR of n-butanoic acid, whereas intermediate (VIII) would be involved in its formation during the TPSR of n-butanal. No significant amounts of heptan-4-one are desorbed in the TPSR of butan-1-ol, although carboxylate species exist on the cata- lyst as demonstrated by 63 Hg evolution at high temperatures, as well as by IR data on ZnO. However, the TPSR runs with butan-1-ol added to the carrier gas stream led to the desorption of heptan-4-one as soon as n-butanal was formed by dehydrogenation of the alcohol molecule. Thus, it may be inferred that the evolution of heptan-4-one in the TPSR of butan-1-ol is prevented by the lack of available aldehydic molecules, since the mechanism proposed for the formation of the ketone precursor (VIII) requires condensation between a carboxylate compound and a molecule with a reactive carbonyl group [11]. The differences noted between the TPSR spectra in Figs. 3 and 4 reflect the effects of K addition to the catalyst formulation on the relative stabilities of the intermediate species. Thus, the reduced formation of propylene as compared to the unpromoted catalyst is probably associated with a greater stability of the 64 carboxylate (V) towards decarboxylation, in line with the higher decomposition temperatures of the alkali salts of fatty acids. The effect of K addition on the relative amount of heptan-4-one and C-, olefins has already been discussed. The promoting role of alkali metals in ketonization reactions of alcohols over oxidic catalysts has been reported [13]. Relevance to the mechanism of Higher Alcohol Synthesis The combined application of FT-IR and Temperature Programmed Re- action techniques has provided a particularly informative approach to mech- anistic investigations. The present study presents detailed indications for a number of characteristic chemical functions of ZnO-based catalysts. In order to assess the relevance of such functions and of the associated chemical reactions under actual HAS conditions, however, the results of our investiga- tion must be discussed critically in comparison with catalytic, kinetic and thermodynamic data obtained from the analysis of flow reactor experiments under synthesis conditions, keeping in mind the different settings for the operating variables with respect to TPSR runs. This will be the subject of a forthcoming paper [6]. In the following, the main results are reviewed briefly to show that the most obvious functions of ZnO-based catalysts as revealed by our investigation appear to be strictly related to some of the mechanistic features controlling the spectrum of products in HAS over similar catalytic systems. (a) Aldolic-type condensations. It has been proposed by many authors that the HAS occurs via a slow first step, responsible for the first C C bond 53 formation, followed by a fast chain growth involving aldolic condensations of aldehydic intermediates on the J? -carbon atoms of the growing alcohol chain. This hypothesis was based essentially on the nature of the products formed in the synthesis. Our data provide direct evidence for the occurrence of aldolic- type condensations over HAS catalysts. A kinetic model of the alcohol chain growth in HAS, based primarily on crossed aldolic-type condensations of Ci, Cg and intermediates, has been found to describe adequately the experi- mental ^ alcohol distribution obtained over a Cs-promoted Zn-Cr-0 cata- lyst [14]. (b) Ketonization. Decarboxylative condensations between carboxylic and carbonyl compounds, leading to ketones, have been clearly demonstrated. (c) Decarboxylation. This emerges as one of the dominant catalytic functions demonstrated by TPSR runs, being involved in the formation of ketones as well as Cy and C-, olefins. Ketones and olefins are side-products of the HAS over alkali-promoted high-temperature methanol catalysts, typically with small concentrations. However, a recent thermodynamic analysis of the reaction products in the HAS over a Cs-doped Zn-Cr-0 catalyst [4] has shown that the low concentrations of ketones (and possibly of some olefins) in the product mixture are due to unfavourable thermodynamic constraints. Thus, decarboxylation is also active under HAS conditions, but its influence on the spectrum of products is limited by thermodynamics. Due to the typical high Hg partial pressures in the HAS, ketones and olefins are hydrogenated to secondary alcohols and paraffins, respectively. Thus, the decarboxylation function plays an important role in explaining many classes of product observed under actual synthesis conditions. (d) Hydrogenation-dehydrogenation. TPSR data illustrate the facile de- hydrogenation capability of the Zn-Cr-0 catalysts. In TPSR, butan-1-ol is dehydrogenated to n-butanal at > 200 C, and dehydrogenation steps are involved in the decarboxylative condensation route to ketones. Under reac- tion conditions, this important catalytic function is reflected by the rapid approach of the experimental (primary alcohol/aldehyde) and (secondary alcohol/ketone) ratios to their equilibrium values [4]. In summary, a strict correspondence appears to exist between the indications of FT-IR and TPSR data and the behaviour of ZnO-based cata- lysts under synthesis conditions. This supports the hypothesis that the mechanistic scheme developed for the interpretation of the TPSR data (shown in Fig. 5) may be generalized, and applied to account for mechanistic features of the HAS associated both with the chain growth of primary alcohols and with the formation of a number of side products, including aldehydes, ketones, secondary alcohols, olefins and paraffins. It is also worth noting that some of the chemical reactions involved in the scheme (e.g. aldolic condensation, aldehyde disproportionation, ketonization and dehydro- genation) are characteristic of base-catalyzed organic chemistry in solution. 54 Acknowledgements Financial support from CNR, Rome (Progetto Finalizzato Energetica 2) is gratefully acknowledged.

Lietti E. Tronconi P. Forzatti Dipartimento di Chimica Industriale e Ingegneria Chimica del Politecnico, P.zza L. Da Vinci 32, 20133 MilanItaly G. Busca Istituto di Chimica, Facoltà di Ingegneria, Università di Genova, GenoaItaly Aspects of the mechanism involved in the synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols from syngas have been investigated by combined FT-IR spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) techniques. Results concerning the interaction of C4 linear oxygenated molecules with ZnO-based catalysts have been interpreted on the basis of a mechanistic scheme demonstrating a number of catalytic functions. Some of the related reactions are characteristic of base-catalyzed organic chemistry in solution: aldolic-type condensation, aldehyde disproportionation, ketonization, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation. By comparison with catalytic activity data under actual reaction conditions, it is found that the same functions also play an important role in determining the spectrum of products of the synthesis, although the relative relevance of the associated chemical reactions is altered by the different operating conditions as well as by thermodynamic constraints.
