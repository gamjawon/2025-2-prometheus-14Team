Graphical abstract Metalloporphyrin-catalysed direct functionalization of saturated CH bonds is one among the topical and challenging areas within the chemical industry. In this work, three types of unsupported and boehmite supported trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrin chloride complexes (Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl, Fe-D(p-Cl)PPCl, Mn-D(p-Cl)PPCl) were prepared and characterized. It has been found that these trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrins have high catalytic activity in cyclohexane oxidation under dioxygen. The boehmite supported metalloporphyrins show better catalytic performance and are more stable than unsupported metalloporphyrins. Among these supported metalloporphyrin catalysts, Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl/BM was better than Fe-D(p-Cl)PPCl/BM and Mn-D(p-Cl)PPCl/BM, the cyclohexane conversion and selectivity to KA oil are 6.83% and 83.30%, respectively, and the turnover number is 1.05×107. The Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl/BM catalyst can be facilely recovered and was recycled up to six times without significant decrease in catalytic performance. Keywords Trans-A2B2 types metalloporphyrins Boehmite Cyclohexane oxidation Dioxygen Supported catalyst 1 Introduction Although many types of metalloporphyrins (MPs) have been largely studied for their catalytic performance in oxidation reactions, the application of metalloporphyrins in synthetic chemistry and chemical industry is not popular because of its economic problem. Therefore, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds is still a challenging and promising subject. Cyclohexane oxidation with air or dioxygen in the absence of additives and solvents is one of the most important industrial process to produce KA oil (cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone) or adipic acid, which are key intermediates used principally for the production of caprolactam, nylon-6,6 and nylon-6 [1,2]. Like cytochrome P-450, metalloporphyrins have been proven to be efficient oxidation catalysts, which are known to activate O2 and perform hydrocarbon oxidation into the corresponding oxygenic compounds under mild condition [3–6]. Homogeneous systems based on metalloporphyrins have achieved good activities and high selectivities in catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons. However, the metalloporphyrins are inclined to aggregation through π–π interactions or decompose during the catalytic oxidation process [7–10]. Furthermore, it is hard to recover and recycle from the homogeneous media at the end of the first reaction [11]. Immobilization of the metalloporphyrins on inert and stable inorganic supports is one of the most effective ways to overcome the above drawbacks. In addition, much efforts have been devoted to develop heterogeneous metalloporphyrin catalysts on various supports [12–16], which referred that the turnover number (TON) is 18.92, 1.54×105 and 7.91×104. Boehmite (BM) has attracted much attention because of their unique structure, high surface energy and easy preparation [17–19]. Some of them referred that the turnover number (TON) is 1.14×105 and 2.3×105. Boehmite, a principal oxo-hydroxide of aluminum, which is also the topological precursor for synthesizing γ-Al2O3, is widely used as adsorbent, catalyst, catalyst support, and composite material. Boehmite can be easily prepared in nanoparticle form of high surface energy and good thermal stability. It also possesses an oxygen atom acting as an electron pair donor, thus providing an opportunity of coordination to the metal ion of the metalloporphyrin. Furthermore, metalloporphyrin can be firmly adsorbed onto its surface. Boehmite supported A4-type metalloporphyrin (Mn TPP) has been utilized in cyclohexane oxidation by Huang [20], the single-pass yield of KA oil is around 5% and the turnover number (TON) is 1.49×105. In this paper, several trans-A2B2 types metalloporphyrin chloride complexes (Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl, Fe-D(p-Cl)PPCl, Mn-D(p-Cl)PPCl) were synthesized (Scheme 1 ) and immobilized on boehmite. The relationship between the central metal ion of trans-A2B2 type metalloporphyrins and their catalytic performance in cyclohexane oxidation was studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (98%), NH3 aqueous (NH3 27%) and absolute ethanol were all obtained from Aladdin Reagent. No impurities were found in the cyclohexane by GC analysis before use. 2.2 Trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrin chloride complexes (MsDClPPCl) All reagents and solvents used for the synthesis of porphyrin were of analytical grade and were obtained commercially. MsDClPPCl (CoDClPPCl, FeDClPPCl, MnDClPPCl) was prepared by referring to the following procedures [21,22]. D-(p-Cl)PP (0.25mol) was dissolved in DMF (50mL). The solution was heated to reflux with stirring. Then, cobalt acetate, ferrous chloride or manganous acetate (1.50mmol) was added in three portions within 30min. When the thin-layer chromatography (silica) indicated no free base porphyrin, the solution was cooled to 70°C, and 40mL of 6M HCl was added and stirred for 4h. The solution was cooled and the appeared solid was filtrated and washed with 3M HCl until the filtrate no longer appeared red. The obtained solid was vacuum-dried, and gave 89–98% yield of MsDClPPCl (CoDClPPCl, FeDClPPCl, MnDClPPCl). 2.3 Preparation of trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrin chloride/BM catalyst The trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrin chloride/BM (MsDClPPCl/BM) catalysts were prepared by referring to the following procedures [20]. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (0.25mol) was dissolved in distilled water (500mL) for 30min under vigorous stirring at room temperature, and 1.45mol of NH3 aqueous was slowly added into the solution. After the white aluminum hydroxide precipitate was formed for 1h, the mixture was filtrated and washed with distilled water until no NH3 aqueous or NH4Cl was detected. Then, the precipitate was added to 250mL of ethanol in a three-necked flask with high stirring for 1h. Subsequently, 0.015mmol of MsDClPPCl ethanol solution were slowly added into the above suspension and stirred for another 40min, and the mixture was heated to 50°C with rapid stirring for 6h. The light-brown suspension was filtrated and washed with distilled water, and the cake was vacuum-dried at 170°C for 10h. 2.4 Catalysts characterization 2.4.1 UV–vis UV–vis spectra was obtained by UV-2550 spectrophotometry with a scan range of 300–800nm for trans-A2B2-metalloporphyrin chloride complexes using 1cm quartz cuvette. MsDClPPCl/BM was characterized by using barium sulphate as reference, a small amount of BaSO4 was pressed into thin pellets, and some samples were put on the pellets and pressed again, then it was placed in the sample holder to assay their spectra. 2.4.2 FTIR Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 380 spectrometer. The spectra of the samples were acquired in the wave number range of 400–4000cm−1. The samples were ground to fine powders, mixed with KBr, and then were pressed into thin pellets and placed in the sample holder of the spectrometer to assay their spectra. 2.4.3 Thermal analysis TG/DTG curves were carried out on a TGA Q50 using air as purge gas (80mLmin−1). The temperature is between 30 and 800°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. 2.4.4 X-ray diffraction analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Japan Rigaku D/Max 2550 VB+ 18kW X-ray diffractometer under the conditions of 40kV, 30mA, Cu Kα radiation, with a scanning rate of 2°/min in the range of 2θ =20–80°. 2.4.5 Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) The amount of MsDClPPCl/BM (Co, Fe and Mn) per gram of boehmite was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectometer (IRIS Intrepid II XSP ICP-AES) (Thermo Electron Co.) under a microwave pressure digestion (MDS 200; CEM) with hydrofluoric and aquaregia. The samples were digested by a traditional acid method (HF, HNO3, HClO4 and HCl), diluted adequately and analyzed for Co, Fe and Mn. 2.5 Procedures for the catalytic test Cyclohexane oxidation was carried out in a 50mL autoclave reactor with a magnetic stirrer in the absence of solvent. Typically, catalysts and cyclohexane (15.6g) were added into the autoclave reactor. And the reactor was sealed and heated to the setting temperature. Then it was pressurized to the setting pressure with the molecular oxygen under stirring. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to the ambient temperature. The mixture was dissolved in ethanol and the catalysts were removed by filtration. And the catalysts were washed in alcohol and dried, and then recycled in the next reaction. The samples of the reaction mixture were identified by GC–MS and LC–MS. The acid in the product can mainly be attributed to the succinic acid, glutaric acid and adipic acid. The cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in the product were analyzed by gas chromatography with the internal standard method using chlorobenzene as the internal standard. The total acid in the product was analyzed by the chemical titration method. The total ester in the product was analyzed by the chemical titration method with a solution of hydrochloric acid. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts UV–vis and FTIR spectroscopies were used to confirm the cobalt, iron and manganese MsDClPPCl. The results of UV–vis absorption measurements of MsDClPPCl are shown in Table 1 . It is well known that porphyrin has one soret band and four Q band absorption peaks in the ultraviolet visible region. The number of Q band usually reduces to one or two owing to the increase of symmetry of the molecular structure when metalloporphyrins form. The results of UV–vis absorption in Table 1 show that MsDClPPCl forms. Furthermore, IR spectra of these metallic complexes shows some characteristic bands; the strong absorption band appeared at 1000cm−1, an increased intensity of the band at 1350cm−1, corresponding to CN stretching, and the absence of the band at 3300cm−1 indicates that the metalloporphyrins form, that is, NH stretching of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds usually presents in the free base porphyrin. These contributions directly argue for the formation of the corresponding metallic complexes [23]. CoDClPPCl/BM shows bright red in color. FeDClPPCl/BM and MnDClPPCl/BM show light green in color, which indicates that metalloporphyrins are successfully supported on boehmite. UV–vis spectra of the boehmite supported metalloporphyrins are shown in Fig. 1 . CoDClPPCl/BM, FeDClPPCl/BM and MnDClPPCl/BM show the Soret peak at 432nm, 417nm and 480nm respectively. Besides, FeDClPPCl/BM and MnDClPPCl/BM present aborption peaks at 574nm and 614nm. The UV–vis spectra confirm that these supported materials contain metalloporphyrin species. FTIR spectra were obtained in order to observe the interactions between OH groups on the surface of boehmite and metalloporphyrin complexes. However, the main characteristic peak of the immobilized metalloporphyrin complexes could not be observed due to the very low amount of metalloporphyrins on the surface of boehmite. Thermal analysis was used to verify the stability of the supported catalysts designed for oxidation reactions. For all samples, there is a rapid weight loss between 60 and 140°C. The weight loss of the supported catalysts reduced during 140–240°C indicating that the weight loss of MsDClPPCl/BM was too small to change the structure of the complexes. This can also be seen from the corresponding DTG curves. Thus, the structure of the supported catalysts will not lead to decomposition since the cyclohexane oxidation was carried out at 150–160°C. The XRD patterns of boehmite, CoDClPPCl/BM, FeDClPPCl/BM and MnDClPPCl/BM exhibit characteristic broad peaks of the boehmite phase. The easy formation of nanoparticles enhances the dispersion and adsorption of the metalloporphyrin. And the typical peaks pattern at 2θ =28, 38, 49 and 65° for all the samples of boehmite and boehmite supported metalloporphyrins were in agreement with the literature [24]. The amount of metalloporphyrin on the support was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectometer (IRIS Intrepid II XSP ICP-AES). The results show that the amount of CoDClPPCl, FeDClPPCl and MnDClPPCl was 0.276, 0.284 and 0.056mgg−1 of boehmite respectively. 3.2 Catalytic performance The results of catalytic performance of cobalt, iron and manganese metalloporphyrins are described in Table 2 . Under the same reaction conditions (entries 1–3 and 5–7), Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl presents the highest selectivity to KA oil, and Mn-D(p-Cl)PPCl exhibits the highest cyclohexane conversion. Comparing the consequences of entry 4 and 5, we could find that the cyclohexane conversion decreases in a certain degree while the selectivity to KA oil increases by 21.61%. During the cyclohexane oxidation process, we observe that the induction period varies with the different metalloporphyrin catalysts, Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl may activate oxygen molecules more quickly than the other two metalloporphyrin catalysts. The reason may be that different central metal ions changed the original electric potential of the MsDClPPCl. Table 3 shows the results of cyclohexane oxidation catalyzed by MsDClPPCl/BM. It was found that boehmite supported metalloporphyrin catalysts show better catalytic performance than unsupported catalysts. When the reaction was catalyzed by boehmite supported metalloporphyrins under 1MPa in the absence of solvent, the selectivity to KA oil increases 12–17% at almost the same cyclohexane conversion. Similarly, compared with the results of supported and unsupported catalysts, the selectivity to KA oil increases 6–10% at the cyclohexane conversion of around 15% under 2MPa in the absence of solvent. And the TON is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of unsupported catalyst. Among these boehmite supported metalloporphyrin catalysts, Co-D(p-Cl)PPCl/BM presents the best catalytic performance in cyclohexane oxidation. This is in accordance with the known differences in chemistry of the concerned metalloporphyrins [25,26]. The cobalt porphyrins are active in one-electron redox processes, such as the activation of dioxygen, while iron and manganese porphyrins are more likely to activate single oxygen donors, such as PhIO, H2O2, t-BuOOH, or NaOCl in a two-electron redox reaction. It can be seen from Tables 2 and 3 that MsDClPPCl/BM presents better catalytic performance in cyclohexane oxidation. At the same time, MsDClPPCl/BM catalysts show a longer induction period than that of MsDClPPCl. In metalloporphyrins/O2 system [27,28], Ms(III)DClPPCl loses a chlorine radical to form Ms(II)DClPP, which combines with an oxygen molecule to form an activated radical species Ms(III)OODClPP, and then form the high-valent metal-oxo active species. And the intermediate Ms(IV)=ODClPP can easily capture a hydrogen atom from cyclohexane to afford an alkyl radical and then form the products [29]. The chlorine radical can also easily capture a hydrogen atom from cyclohexane to afford an alkyl radical, which combines with an oxygen molecule to form the activated peroxoradicals species (ROO), then it may form organic acids. The corresponding active species for the supported catalyst [20] were mainly Ms(IV)=ODClPP/BM (Scheme 2 ). The longer induction period of Ms(III)DClPPCl/BM may be that the formation of Ms(IV)=ODClPP is faster than Ms(IV)=ODClPP/BM. The existence of BM hindered the supported catalysts and dioxygen to form the active species Ms(IV)=ODClPP/BM, which can capture a hydrogen atom from cyclohexane to afford an alkyl radical and then form the products. The chlorine radical and Ms(IV)=ODClPP/BM can also easily capture a hydrogen atom from cyclohexane to afford an alkyl radical, and then it combines with an oxygen molecule to form the activated peroxoradicals species (ROO) which may form organic acids. That is, the steric hindrance of BM decreases the oxygen activation ability of the supported metalloporphyrin catalysts. This steric hindrance leads to increase the selectivity to KA oil and prevents from further oxidation of KA oil to byproducts. It may be the reason why the supported catalyst shows better catalytic performance than the unsupported catalyst, which is consistent with the results of Tables 2 and 3. In general, the electron-withdrawing metalloporphyrins are very strong for activating O2 because the electron deficiency of the central metal ion is willing to accept a pair of electrons donated by O2. The potential order of metal ions is different. The synergistic effect on the potential and the formation of active species could give rise to the long induction period and different catalytic performance. This may be the reason why cobalt metalloporphyrin shows better results than that of iron and manganese metalloporphyrin. 3.3 Effect of the catalyst amount The effect of the amount of CoDClPPCl/BM catalyst was investigated and the results are shown in Table 4 . The cyclohexane conversion and selectivity to KA oil change very little when the amount of CoDClPPCl/BM catalyst increases from 0.12 to 0.22mg under 1MPa or increase from 0.14 to 0.44mg under 2MPa. However, the selectivity to KA oil decreases significantly when the catalyst amount declines from 0.14 to 0.04mg under 2MPa. Similarly, the boehmite supported Co-DClPPCl catalyst show better catalytic performance than the unsupported catalyst, the selectivity to KA oil increases by more than 11%. 3.4 Recycle of the CoDClPPCl/BM catalyst Recycling tests with repeated use of CoDClPPCl/BM catalyst in six consecutive reactions were carried out under the typical reaction conditions, the recycled catalysts were washed with alcohol, dried and then used for the next reaction. The results are shown in Table 5 . It can be seen from Table 5 that the change of catalytic activity and selectivity could be ignored. However, the cyclohexane oxidation catalyzed by the unsupported catalysts gives lower selectivity to KA oil (65.40–68.77%) and lower TON (0.55–0.67×106). Furthermore, unsupported catalysts are difficult to recover and reused. Thus, the advantages of the bohmite supported CoDClPPCl catalyst were obvious. 4 Conclusion Unsupported and boehmite supported metalloporphyrin catalysts were prepared and characterized. The prepared catalysts were used to mimic cytochrome P-450 in cyclohexane oxidation process. In general, boehmite supported metalloporphyrin catalysts show better catalytic performance than unsupported metalloporphyrins, the selectivity to KA oil is improved 12–17% under the cyclohexane conversion of 6–8%. And CoDClPPCl/BM presents the best results, it gives the selectivity to KA oil of 83.30% at the cyclohexane conversion of 6.83% and TON reaches 1.05×107. This complex may prove to be an active and reusable catalyst for industrial cyclohexane oxidation process.
