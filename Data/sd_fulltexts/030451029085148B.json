David Jackson*, Fraser J. Robertson and Janice Willis ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd., Research and Technology Dept., The Catalysis Centre, P.O. Box 1, Billingham, Cleveland TS23 1LB (U.K.) (Received April 30, 1990; revised June 20, 1990) Abstract Four silica supports were used to prepare copper/silica catalysts, by impregnation, using copper nitrate, and by ion-exchange, using tetra-amrnine copper carbonate as the metal precursors. The copper species present in the as-prepared catalysts were characterised by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The reduction of the samples was studied by TPR, TGA and XRD, and [^O] carbon dioxide chemisorption was used to examine the adsorption behaviour. Ethene hydrogenation was used as a test reaction. XRD indicated a bimodal particle size distribution for the nitrate derived catalysts. TGA and TPR were in agreement over the minimum temperature required for reduction, but [\"O] carbon dioxide chemisorption revealed the presence of residual oxygen after the reduction sequence. The catalysts were active for ethene hydrogenation even in the presence of the residual oxygen. Introduction Many of the studies of copper catalysts have been concerned with coprecipitated copper/zinc catalysts [ 1 ] for use in methanol synthesis; copper/ silica catalysts [2-5] however have not been investigated to the same degree. In this study we have examined the characterisation and hydrogenation ability of eight copper/silica samples prepared by two distinct routes. Copper nitrate and tetra-ammine copper carbonate were chosen as typical commercial catalyst precursors yet ones which allowed both an impregnation route, involving copper nitrate, and an ion-exchange route, using tetra-ammine copper car- bonate. Four silica supports were used to ascertain how much variation (if any) in the results could be attributed to the silica support. The as-prepared catalysts were characterised by UV-visible diffuse re- flectance spectroscopy (DRS). The reduction of the catalysts was studied by TPR, TGA and XRD. Carbon dioxide was used to examine the adsorptive capacity of the samples. Ethene hydrogenation was used as a simple test reaction to examine the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts. This reaction is suitable over a wide range of temperatures, as it is a slow reaction over copper at ambient temperatures compared with Group VIII metals. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 256 Experimental Catalyst preparation Eight copper/silica catalysts were prepared. Four catalysts were prepared using copper nitrate as the precursor and four prepared from tetra-ammine copper carbonate. Copper nitrate was dissolved in demineralised water and the required quantity of solution to achieve a nominal weight loading of 5% Cu on the supports was added to each of the four silicas: Cab-0-Sil (surface area 209 m2 g-1), Shell S980G (surface area 70 m2 g~1), PQ CS1030E (surface area 300 m2 g~1), and ICI (surface area 500 m2 g~1). The resulting suspensions were evaporated to dryness at 353 K and their UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra recorded. All the spectra of the nitrate-derived catalysts showed only a broad band at 800 nm attributable to the [Cu'^HaCOe]\"1\"2 ion. Basic copper carbonate was dissolved in ammonia solution. The resulting solution (pH 13.2) was filtered before adding the required amount to each of the silicas. The suspensions obtained were evaporated to dryness at 353 K and their UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra recorded. The spectrum of copper carbonate dissolved in ammonium hydroxide at pH 13.2 gave a d-d transition band at 618 nm, which was assigned to [(^\"(N113)4(1120)2]. The spectra of the carbonate-derived catalysts did not exhibit a band at 618 nm, but all exhibited a band at 670 nm. This species was assigned as [(S^gCu^NH^HaO)] [ 2 ]. A band at 800 nm attributed to the [Cu'^O)^\"^2 ion was also present. The weight loadings of the metal and nomenclature for the catalysts are detailed in Table 1. Experimental Apparatus/Method The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts was carried out in flowing 5% hydrogen/nitrogen (50 cm3 min~1) by heating to 573 K TABLE 1 Copper loading and nomenclature for the catalysts Catalyst % Cu\" Nomenclature Cu(NC>3)2/Cab-0-Sil 4.2 N/C CuCCOaVCab-O-Sil 3.3 C/C Cu(NOg)2/SheU SiOg 4.0 N/S Cu(C03)/Shell SiOa 3.5 C/S Cu(N03)2/ICI SiOa 3.6 W Cu(C03)ACI SiOa 3.0 CA Cu(NC>3)2/PQ SiOa 3.8 N/P CuCCOsVPQ SiOg 3.2 C/P \"% Cu expressed as w/w. 257 (7 deg min\"1) and holding at this temperature for 0.5 h. The reduction of the catalysts was also studied by thennogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a duPont 1090 thennogravimetric analyser and a heating rate of 10 deg min\"1 in flowing nitrogen and flowing 5% hydrogen/nitrogen. Chemisorption and hydrogenation studies were performed in the dynamic mode using a pulse- flow microreactor system. Using this system, catalysts (typically 0.3-0.5 g) could be reduced in situ in flowing 5% hydrogen in nitrogen (50 cm3 min\"1) by heating to 573 K (7 deg min\"1). After reduction had ceased the catalyst was cooled in 5% hydrogen in nitrogen, maintained in flowing helium (55 cm3 min\"') and then covered by the adsorbate gas by injecting pulses of known size (typically 2 cm3, 6.67 X 103 Pa) into the helium carrier gas stream and hence to the catalyst. The amount of gas adsorbed from any pulse was determined from the difference between a calibration peak area and the peak area obtained following the injection of pulses of comparable size onto the catalyst. The typical adsorption detection limit was 0.04 XlO18 molecules (g.catalyst)\"1. Desorptions were performed by heating the catalyst to 573 K in flowing helium. After thermal desorption the catalyst was cooled in flowing helium. Ethene hydrogenation was studied using a similar procedure, pulses (typically 2 cm3, 6.67X103 Pa) of 1:1 C2H4:Ha were injected into the helium carrier gas stream and hence to the catalyst at a known temperature. Adsorptions, desorptions and reactions were followed using a T.C.D. gas chromatograph, fitted with a Porapak Q-S column coupled to a mass spectrometer (Spectramass SM100D, fitted with a high resolution RF head). UV-visible DRS were obtained using a Pye-Unicam PU8800 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating spheroid. The range of operation using the spheroid was 190 800 nm. X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Siemens automatic powder diffraction system which incorporated in situ reduction facilities. Materials Both the helium (Air Products, 99.998%) and the 5% hydrogen in nitrogen (ICI) were further purified by passing them through activated palladium bronze to remove any oxygen impurity, and a bed of Carbosorb AS (BDH) to remove any water impurity. The [\"O] carbon dioxide was supplied by Amersham International and the ethene by BDH; both were used without further purification. Results Reduction studies The catalysts were reduced in flowing 5% hydrogen/nitrogen by heating to 573 K and held at this temperature for 0.5 h by which time all hydrogen uptake had ceased. The loss of hydrogen during the reduction was followed by GC MS; Table 2 gives the temperatures of the reduction peaks. The reduction of the catalysts was also studied by TGA using both flowing nitrogen 258 TABLE 2 Catalyst reduction Catalyst Reduction peak maxima* H:Cu ratio\" N/C 545 7.3 C/C 550 5.5 N/S 545 8.4 C/S 570 7.1 N/I 430 495 530 13.4 1:4.5:1.3 C/I 543 3.7 N/P 550 573 14.4 1.2:1 C/P 523 9.6 Temperature, K.

The results are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. No further reduction was observed at higher temperatures (<1273 K). When the catalysts were examined by XRD after preparation, only a broad band at 0.4 nm was detected due to the silica support. Each of the catalysts was then heated to 573 K in flowing 6% hydrogen/nitrogen and held for 1 h before cooling to 303 K. A diffraction pattern was collected both at 573 K and after cooling to 303 K; there was no significant difference between the patterns. Three of the samples produced from copper nitrate (N/C, N/I, and N/P) exhibited a broad band with a sharp band superimposed, indicative of a bimodal distribution of large and small copper crystallites. The results are reported in Table 3. After recording of the XRD pattern, he samples were discharged and opened to air. Later (2 weeks) the samples were re-analysed without any further reduction. Only the N/S sample retained crystalline copper; all other samples had re-oxidised. [^O] carbon dioxide adsorption Isotopically labelled [^O] carbon dioxide was pulsed over each catalyst at 273 K immediately after reduction. The amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed is detailed in Table 4. Little or no carbon dioxide was retained by any of the catalysts. Analysis of the isotopic profile of the effluent carbon dioxide however, revealed that there had been considerable oxygen exchange between the [^O] carbon dioxide and the catalysts. To compare the extent of exchange, a fixed amount of [^O] carbon dioxide was passed over each catalyst at 273 K, and the amount of [^O] oxygen incorporation calculated (Table 4). It was observed that mass 46 (C'W'O) response maximised approximately 20 s after mass 48 (C^Og) response. The silica supports did not interact with the carbon dioxide. (UHU/%) eAjlBAU9Q (UIIU/%) 9A!

Ethene hydrogenation The object of this part of the study was not to obtain kinetic data, but to use the hydrogenation of ethene to ethane as a diagnostic test of the materials' ability to catalyse a hydrogenation reaction. The reaction was studied over the temperature range 323-573 K. The results are shown in Table 5. Ethane was the sole product at all temperatures and, within experimental limits, no carbon deposition could be detected. Adsorption of ethene, as distinct from hydrogenation, was detected only with catalyst C/I at 323 K. The catalytic activity increased with temperature, passed through a maximum and then decreased for all samples tested. 264 TABLE 5 Ethene hydrogenation over copper catalysts' Catalyst Rate of formation1' Order' 2, 7 1 3 5 4 6 Temp.

Discussion Reduction studies The TGA results from the catalysts derived from copper nitrate show that in nitrogen there is loss of water below 373 K and a weight loss between 373 and 423 K which can be related to copper nitrate decomposition with the loss of nitric acid [6a] and the formation of Cu(N03)a 2Cu(OH)2 [6b]. The weight loss at 573-673 K is a combination feature which can be assigned to thermal decomposition of any copper nitride (decomposes at 573 K) which may be present, desorption of NO [6b] and decomposition of Cu(N03)2 2Cu(OH)a. When the TGA is performed in reducing gas, the weight losses due to water desorption and copper nitrate decomposition are still detectable. However further weight losses, in the region of 4%, are observed between 473 and 523 K. This degree of weight loss is what is expected from Cu(N03)2 2Cu(OH)a being reduced to copper metal. There is no further weight loss at higher temperatures, other than that due to dehydroxylation of the silica support. TGA of the nitrate-derived samples indicated that the copper nitrate decomposed to copper hydroxy nitrate before reduction to copper metal. A H:Cu ratio of 7:1 is sufficient to achieve reduction of copper hydroxy nitrate to copper metal by eqn. (1) and all the catalysts have ratios greater than 7:1. Cu(N03)a 2Cu(OH)a +1 IHg 3Cu + 2NHa + lOHgO (1) Cu(NC>3)2 + 9Ha > Cu + 2NHs + 6HgO (2) 265 However the reduction of copper nitrate requires a H:Cu ratio of 18:1 (eqn. (2)). Hence the variable H:Cu ratio may reflect the relative amounts of copper nitrate and copper hydroxy nitrate present on the support at the time of reduction. Similar TPR data have been published for copper oxide/nitrate by Robertson et al. [7] and Gentry et al. [8]. The variation in the amount of copper hydroxy nitrate present may be related to the chemical reactivity of the surface hydroxyls present on the support surface; however, further research is required to confirm such a hypothesis. On examination by XRD, three of the reduced nitrate-derived samples (N/C, N/I and N/P) had bimodal particle size distributions of large and small copper crystallites. Such a distribution may suggest that more than one copper surface species is present prior to reduction. This is in agreement with the TPR/TGA results, which indicate that more than one copper species is present on the nitrate-derived samples prior to reduction. The lack of evidence for such a second species in the UV vis spectra is not necessarily significant; if this species were to have a weaker ligand field than water, then the UV vis spectra would be shifted outside the range of the spectrometer. The N/S sample had only large crystallites present (40 nm) and was the only sample not to reoxidise when exposed to air. This large particle size may be a reflection of the low surface are of the Shell silica, as the C/S sample also had the largest particle size among the tetra-ammine based catalysts. TGA of the copper tetra-ammine derived-catalysts in a nitrogen atmosphere exhibits only one major weight loss, which can be assigned to loss of water. When the TGA is performed in 5% hydrogen/nitrogen, an extra weight loss due to reduction is observed at 473-573 K; there is no higher temperature weight loss associated with reduction. However the weight losses are not those expected with reduction of the copper ammine complex to copper metal; such a process should give a weight loss of approximately 3.5%. Also the loss of residual carbonate Ugands would tend to increase the observed weight loss, but instead the weight loss is less than expected. This limited weight loss may indicate incomplete reduction of the metal complex or that the gas phase species formed on reduction readsorb on another component of the catalyst (e.g. the support). The reduction of the tetra-ammine-derived samples is also complex. If the species to be reduced was the tetra-ammine copper carbonate, then a H:Cu ratio of 10:1 may be obtained (eqn. (3)): Cu(NH3)4(C03) + 5Hg Cu + CH4 + 4NHa + 3HaO (3) however, UV-visible DRS results indicated that ^10)20^(^3)3^20)] and the [Cua(H20)a}+2 ion were the major surface species, which would reduce the hydrogen requirement considerably (at the limit 2:1 H:Cu, although the counter-ion for the hexa-aquo ion may reduce and require extra hydrogen). Therefore the degree of reduction of the copper tetra-ammine based catalysts cannot be directly determined from the TPR data. 266 The XRD results confirm the presence of copper metal on catalysts prepared from tetra-ammine copper carbonate. In general the particle sizes were smaller than those obtained from the nitrate derived samples. The UV vis DRS show there are two species present on the tetra-ammine-derived catalysts: one is ion-exchanged with silanol groups of the surface, i.e. [CSiCDaCu^Is^sCHaO:)], the other is based on [Cv^^O)^2. Amara et al. [2] and Kohler et al. [5] have shown that isolated ion-exchanged species do not reduce fully to Cu but only reduce to Cu', and therefore this component will not be detectable by XRD. The remaining species typically gives highly dispersed copper (1-3 nm) on reduction [2, 5] at copper levels above 1 w/ w%. Adsorption studies The adsorption of carbon dioxide on copper is well documented and at least two types of adsorbed carbon dioxide have been detected [9, 10]. However, with the silica-supported catalysts very little carbon dioxide is adsorbed. From the XRD data, bulk copper metal is present and at a degree of dispersion which would be expected to give considerable adsorption. Taking 6 nm as the typical particle size of the tetra-ammme catalysts, then using an exposure of 1.47X1019 surface atoms per m2 and a spherical particle, the total metal area should be approximately 3 m2 g~1 with 5 x 1019 surface atoms. Therefore even for the catalyst with the largest adsorptive capacity (catalyst C/C), only 2% of the available surface adsorbs carbon dioxide strongly at 273 K. For the N/P catalyst, a typical particle size of 40 nm is required to achieve the adsorptive capacity experimentally measured; if the smaller particles, detected by XRD, also adsorb then the adsorptive capacity is again significantly less than would be expected. The exchange between [\"O] carbon dioxide and the catalysts (Table 4) indicates that even though the carbon dioxide is not retained by the catalyst there is adsorption. Such an interaction has been seen before over Cu/ZnO/AlgOa catalysts; a weakly bound COg has been observed in a static adsorption system by Kinnaird et al. [9] and in a pulse/flow adsorption system by Jackson [10]. However in both these cases there was also, at 293 K, a strong, irreversible component to the adsorption which is not present in this study. A weak interaction of COg with copper, with no strong interaction, was observed in a subsequent study by Kinnaird et al. [11] when a monolayer of adsorbed oxygen was present on the copper. The C^Og isotope exchange data confirms that oxygen is on the surface of the copper after the reduction sequence. However the quantity of ex- changeable oxygen varies by a factor of forty between the catalysts. Using 6 nm as an average particle size, a monolayer of oxygen requires at least 2 x 1019 atoms (g catalyst)\"1; this is well in excess of the measured exchange capacity of any of the catalysts. Even allowing for a considerable proportion of the copper in the nitrate-derived catalysts to be present as 40 nm particles, there is still a discrepancy between the amount of exchangeable oxygen and the lack of adsorptive capacity. However, not all residual oxygen may exchange 267 with carbon dioxide; it is possible that non-exchangeable oxygen, if present on the surface, would prevent strong adsorption of carbon dioxide. It may be, however, that a species which can inhibit strong adsorption, other than oxygen, is present. Higgs and Pritchard [12] have shown that with catalysts derived from copper nitrate, which are reduced without prior calcination, a surface nitride can be formed which will block adsorption. Equally King [6b] has shown that NO can be retained by the copper lattice and affect adsorption. Under the conditions used in this study either of these two possibilities could occur. Such processes seem less likely with the tetra- ammine catalysts, but nitrogen-containing ligands are present and similar chemistry may be possible. Reaction studies Ethene hydrogenation was used as a means of determining the ability of the samples to catalyse a hydrogenation reaction. Differences in activity between the catalysts are clearly seen (Table 5) and interestingly the support appears to play a larger part in determining the activity of the catalyst than does the starting precursor. This is not unexpected, as the XRD results indicate that the metal precursor is the dominant factor in determining particle size, which is not an important parameter in ethene hydrogenation [13]. More surprisingly, the TPR/TGA results, which indicate the degree of reduction, do not appear to correlate with the observed variations in activity. Neither does the degree of COg adsorption, which gives an indication of the adsorptive capacity of the catalysts. However, the amount of oxygen exchangeable with carbon dioxide may be loosely correlated with activity, as the catalysts which have the smallest amount of exchangeable oxygen have the highest activity. As the reaction itself does not activate the catalysts (analyses 2 and 7, Table 5) and therefore occurs im the presence of adsorbed oxygen, it may be used as a characterisation technique. Typically if a rate of reaction stops increasing with temperature, i.e. reaches a plateau, then a diffusion limitation may be expected however that clearly does not occur in this system. A secondary reaction, which increases in rate faster than the primary reaction, e.g. carbon deposition and/or methane production, can result in a reduction in rate with increasing temperature. However, a carbon balance was obtained from the quantity of unreacted ethene and the product ethane for every pulse. Previous studies [14, 15] of ethene hydrogenation over supported copper catalysts, prepared from direct reduction of the nitrate, have also exhibited this behaviour, which was shown to be due to variations in the relative strengths of adsorption between hydrogen and ethene, such that the pressure dependency in the rate equation varied with temperature, i.e. [C2H4]-0 B[H2]1 at 273 K, [C2H4] [H2]1 at 373 K, and [C2H4]1[H2]1 at 473 K. If we can assume that the intrinsic reaction mechanism does not change and that, between catalysts prepared from common precursors, there is a similarity in metal particle size (from XRD), then the activity and how it varies would be dependent upon the amount of poison on the surface. However 268 the shape of the activity vs. temperature curves are not the same, indicating that it is not a single curve which is moved relative to an absolute, which may have allowed a relationship to be directly obtained between the residual species and its affect on activity, but is a complex interaction related to the adsorption characteristics of both gases, the residual species and support effects. Conclusions The TPR, TGA and XRD results indicated that the samples were reduced with no obvious higher temperature reduction regime, and the ethene hy- drogenation also indicated that there was copper metal present on the surface of the catalysts. However use of isotopically-labelled carbon dioxide as an adsorbent revealed that the surface contained an exchangeable residual oxygen species as well as a non-exchangeable species which blocked adsorption, neither of which was removed during ethene hydrogenation.

Four silica supports were used to prepare copper/silica catalysts, by impregnation, using copper nitrate, and by ion-exchange, using tetra-amrnme copper carbonate as the metal precursors. The copper species present in the as-prepared catalysts were characterised by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The reduction of the samples was studied by TPR, TGA and XRD, and [18O] carbon dioxide chemisorption was used to examine the adsorption behaviour. Ethene hydrogenation was used as a test reaction. XRD indicated a bimodal particle size distribution for the nitrate derived catalysts. TGA and TPR were in agreement over the minimum temperature required for reduction, but [18O] carbon dioxide chemisorption revealed the presence of residual oxygen after the reduction sequence. The catalysts were active for ethene hydrogenation even in the presence of the residual oxygen. References 1 K. Klier D.D. Eley P.W. Selwood P.B.
