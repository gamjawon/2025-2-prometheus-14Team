Various biaryl compounds were easily prepared by the reaction with nickel diaminophosphine catalysts. Keywords: Cross-coupling; Nickel complex; Palladium complex: Biaryl compounds; Diaminophosphine ligand 1. Introduction The transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides with organometallic reagents [1,2] have been demonstrated to be a highly effective method for preparing a number of valuable aromatic products such as aromatic polymer [3-5] and natural products [6-9]. For this reaction, aminophosphine ligands were reported to be more effective than diphosphine ligands [10-12]. However, the activity of the transition-metal aminophosphine catalysts are not satisfactory for the biaryl formation using ' Corresponding author.

PlIS1381-1169(97)00057-5 aryl Grignard reagents [ 13]. In the cross-coupling reaction using the aminophosphine complexes, an intermediary complex is supposed to interact between the nitrogen atom of the ligand and the magnesium of the Grignard reagent (Fig. la) [10-12]. We found that, on complexation to the transition-metals, diamophosphine ligand 3 can coordinate to the metal by P--N chelation leaving one amino unit free [ 14]. In the presence of Grignard reagent, two modes of interaction of Grignard reagent with the diaminophosphine ligand are supposed (Fig. lb) and the acceleration of the cross-coupling may be anticipated. We observed the acceleration by the diaminophosphine-nickel complexes in the cross-coupling reaction of aryl compounds with L14 l Yamada et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) L]3-L]5 M A-Br ;tJ,,M P, Ir N~ /N /p N~ Ar1g-Br Br-Mg M Mg-Br ' ~ ' b Fig. 1.

Results and discussion The diaminophosphine ligands (2 and 3) were prepared in two steps; ortho-lithiation of N,Ndimethylbenzylamine or (S)-N,N-dimethyl-lphenethylamine followed by the reaction with dichlorophenylphosphine (Scheme 1) [14]. The results of cross-coupling reactions' between aryl halides and aryl Grignard reagents were shown in Table l and Scheme 2. The catalysts for the coupling reactions were prepared in situ from the ligand and the [Pd(dba)2] or [Ni(cod)2] complexes. In the cross-coupling reaction by the palladium complexes, diaminophosphine ligand 3 was more effective than aminophosphine 1 (Table 1, runs 1 and 2). Nickel complexes were more active than palladium complexes and the same trend was observed: the nickel-2 and t A typical procedure is given for the reaction of (2-methyl-lnaphthyl)rnagnesium bromide (5a) with 1-naphthyl bromide (4a). To a mixture of 7.4 mg (27 rnmol) of nickel complex (Ni(cycloocta-l,5-diene)Z), 11.0 mg (27 mmol) of diaminophosphine ligand (3), and 280 mg (1.35 mmol) of 1-naphthyl bromide (4a) was added 4.7 ml of 0.29 M (2-methyl-l-naphthyl)rnagnesium bromide (5a) in tetrahydrofuran at -40 under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 25 for 12 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of diluted hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was extracted with hexane and the combined extract was washed with saturated NaHC03 solution and water and dried over anhydrous Na2S04. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatogtaphed on a silica gel column with hexane as an eluent to give 2-methyl-1,1'-binaphthyl 344 mg (95%) (6a). ~ J/ / \\ Ph \\ BuLi / \\ \\ 0.5eq.

Though a diaminophosphine ligand might interact with two Grignard reagents to suggest a 2-fold acceleration, the nickel-2 and -3 catalysts were much more active than the nickel-1 catalyst. The cross-coupling using sterically hindered aryl halide or aryl Grignard reagent proceeded smoothly with nickel-diaminophosphine catalyst (runs 6-8, 10, 11). 2 Hayashi et al. reported that monophosphine ligands having an alkoxyl unit were more effective for nickel-catalyzed biaryl formation reaction than aminophosphine ligands.
