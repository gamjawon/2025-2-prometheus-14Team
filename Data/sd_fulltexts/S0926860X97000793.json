To obtain a bifunctional catalyst, a metallic function (Pt or Pd) is added either to the acid material or in a composite catalyst prepared by mixing the acid materials with either metal/SiO2 or metal/A1203. The synergy of functions produces catalysts more selective to isomers. Since the deactivation by pore blockage decreases, the composite catalysts with H-Mordenite present an improved stability. The composite catalysts with SO]--ZrO2 do not present this improvement because of their wide pore size distribution. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The hydroisomerization and cracking of heavy long-chain n-alkanes (n-C+) over acid and bifunc- tional metal-acid zeolite catalysts have been fre- quently studied [1-12]. These reactions provide an important source of light isoparaffins. Nowadays, the obtention of i-C4 from n-C8~ is an interesting alter- native to cope with the demand of isobutene. This iso- olefin is the raw material for the production of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), the most important non- *Corresponding author.

H-Mordenite (H-MOR) is a microporous zeolite with parallel and non-interconnected elliptical pores of 6.5 ,~ ,~, and ZrO2 promoted with sulfuric acid, SO2--ZrO2 (S-Z) has a broad pore size distribution, between 30 and 70 A [15]. Both materials are solids capable to isomerize n-alkanes, but are rapidly de- activated by coking [ 1-3,12,15-20]. The performance of both acid supports has been previously studied in the isomerization of n-butane [15], and the different catalyst behavior has been explained as differences in the acid strength distribution. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Parera/Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 17-27 When a metallic function is added to an acid support, the bifunctional catalyst obtained displays a synergism between the hydro-dehydrogenating function of the metal and the isomerizing-cracking function of the acidic active sites. Besides, the hydro- genation of coke precursors decreases the deactivation rate and improves the stability of the catalyst [1-3, 12,21-25]. The Pt/H-MOR catalyst is commercially used, displaying a good poison resistance to sulfur and water [26]. The success of the synergism between both functions depends on the accessibility of all the metal particles, on the efficient transport of alkenes between metal and acid sites, and on the adequate surface migration rate of activated hydrogen. The latter limits the coking and can modify the acid-base properties of the support [27]. Carbon deposition can play a double role in the case of microporous supports. In this case, the pore size is of an outstanding importance, influen- cing the activity, stability and selectivity of the catalyst [28,29]. A high coking rate can partially block pores and the circulation paths of products and reactives, leading to a drastic reduction in the active surface available [30]. In spite of the presence of a hydro- genating function, the pore blocking occurs in simple bifunctional microporous catalysts. Guisnet et al. [31 ] studied the effect of the porosity and the distribution of metallic and acid sites in hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-heptane on Pt/H-Y, Pt/H-ZSM5 and Pt/H-MOR. When the dispersed metal particles become isolated in the inner structure due to pore blocking, the blocking rate increases and only the metal loaded on the exterior of the catalyst is active. Liu et al. [32] have recently studied the catalytic isomerization of n-butane and n-pentane over Pt/H- MOR and Pt/S-Z, stating that the differences in rate and kinetic parameters between both catalysts are caused by their different microgeometry. When a physical mixture of particles of an acid catalyst with particles of a metal loaded on an inert support is prepared, a bifunctional composite catalyst is obtained. When the acid support is structurally microporous and the inert support has wide pores, the higher accessibility of metal sites improves the stability. The mixture of H-MOR and Pt/A1203, pro- duces a more stable catalyst than Pt/I-I-MOR [2,3,12]. A composite catalyst similar to this one is used in a commercial process for xylene isomerization. Appar- ently, the metal loaded on alumina controls the blocking of the zeolite micropores, keeping the acid surface more active and being the main cause of the synergism. To verify these hypotheses, the catalytic behavior of H-MOR in relation to another solid acid of different porosity, S-Z, was studied and compared. The single unloaded supports and the metal containing catalysts, either impregnated (with Pt or Pd) or forming com- posite catalysts with metal/alumina and metal/silica catalysts, were compared. We tried to correlate the reactivity and stability with the porous structure of the acid materials and to assess the incidence of the hydrogenating activity of the metal and the nature of its inert support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Four supports of different acidity were used. One was the neutral large pore SiOe, provided in granu- lated form by ALFA; other was the weakly acidic extruded 7-A1203 CK 300 provided by Ketjen, whose chlorine content was adjusted to 0.9 wt% by chlorina- tion with a gaseous stream of air-HCl-water accord- ing to [33]. The other two supports were strongly acidic materials with different structural properties. One was H-MOR Zeolon 900 H, extrudates provided by Norton (atomic ratio Si/AI=7). The other was S-Z, prepared by calcination of powdered SO2--Zr(OH)4. Zr(OH)4 was obtained as detailed elsewhere [15], and it was sulfated by addition of 1 N H2SO4 according to [16]. The pelleted provided materials (H-MOR, A1203 and SiO2) were ground, sieved to 35-80 mesh and calcined in an air flow at 673 K during 4 h. In the case of powdered SQ2--Zr(OH)4, the material was pelleted and similarly grounded, sieved, and calcined at 893 K for 3 h to obtain the maximum concentration of active acid sites [34]. The amount of sulfate was 1.2% after the calcination of S-Z. The supports were used to deposit transition metals with different hydrogenation capabilities, Pt and Pd. Only in the case of zirconia, the metal was loaded over the SO]--Zr(OH)4 before calcination. The addition of metal precursors over H-MOR and SiO2 was per- formed by competitive ionic exchange at 298 K for J.M. Grau, ,LM. Parera/Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 17-27 19 12 h, using solutions of Pt(NH3)2+ or Pd (NH3)2+ as metal precursors and NH4NO3 as competitor (molar ratio 1/250, to obtain a good uptake and distribution of metal on the support, according to [35]). Then the particles were filtered, washed and dried at 393 K for 12 h. Over 7-A1203 and SO2--Zr(OH)4, the metal was loaded by the incipient wetness technique using solu- tions of H2PtC16 and HCI (1/36 molar ratio, according to [36]) and Pd(NO3)2 and HNO3 (to ease the dissolu- tion). Finally, the particles were dried at 393 K for 12h. The activation of the catalysts prepared by ionic exchange was performed by calcination in air (2 Ugh). The temperature was raised from 298 to 453 K at 1 K/ min, it was then kept at 453 K for 2 h, and then raised again to 623 K and kept at this value for 6 h. Finally, the catalysts were cooled to 298 K under nitrogen. The catalysts of Pt and Pd over SO2--Zr(OH)4 were calcined in air at 893 K for 3 h [16], and those pre- pared over A1203 were calcined at 673 K for 3 h. The bifunctional composite catalysts were prepared by mixing equal amounts of each strong acid support, H-MOR or S-Z with a primary catalyst of Pt or Pd supported on 7-A1203 or SiO2. Both components of the composite were ground to 150-200 mesh before mixing. The mixture was stirred and homogenized for 20 min; it was then pressed into 6 mm diameter disks at 6 ton/cm2 and ground to 35-80 mesh. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Some properties of the fresh catalysts are shown in Table 1. Textural properties: BET specific surface area and cumulative pore volume were calculated from N2 adsorption/desorption isothermal data, measured with a Micromeritics Accusorb 2100 equipment. The metal dispersion was measured by hydrogen titration of adsorbed oxygen [37]. The percentage of carbon on the catalyst was determined after the run by combus- tion and absorption of CO2 in a KOH solution. 2.3. Reaction test The reaction test of the different catalyst samples was performed in a bench scale flow equipment comprising a 316 stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor of 18 mm i.d. and accessories similar to those Table 1 Fresh catalyst properties Sample Met (%) D (%) Sg (me/g) Vp (cm3/g) SiO2 -- -- 300 1.000 A1203-C1 -- -- 200 0.750 H-MOR -- -- 515 0.258 SO4--ZrO2 -- -- 104 0.180 Pt/SiO2 0.28 68.3 290 0.985 Pt/A1203 0.35 75.3 195 0.708 Pt/H-MOR 0.34 80.0 505 0.252 Pt/SO42 -ZrO2 0.29 a 98 0.163 Pd/SiO2 0.27 84.5 280 0.976 Pd/AI203 0.28 59.8 180 0.723 Pd/H-MOR 0.31 40.3 510 0.234 Pd/SO2 -ZrO2 0.28 a 94 0.173 Met, metal concentration; D, metallic dispersion; Sg, specific surface area; Vp, pore volume; a, no hydrogen adsorption. previously described [38]. The reaction conditions were 573 K, 1.5 MPa, molar ratio H2/n-Cs=6, weight hourly space velocity, WHSV=4 and a test length of 5 h. The temperature of 573 K was chosen because it was the optimum for n-C8 conversion on Pt/H-MOR [12] and the other reaction conditions were chosen for their similarity to some commercial processes with this type of catalysts. For single catalysts (SiO2, metal/SiO:, AI203, metal/A1203, H-MOR, metal/H-MOR, S-Z and metal/S-Z) 0.5 g was charged to the reactor. For composite catalysts (metal/SiO2 or A1203+H-MOR and metal/SiO2 or A1203+S-Z) 1 g (0.5 g of each component) was charged. In this way, composite catalysts have the same amount of strong acid function that the single H-MOR or S-Z catalysts and the same amount of metal that metal/H-MOR or metal/S-Z. The feed was n-octane RPE from Carlo Erba and pure hydrogen provided by AGA. Before the run, the catalyst was reduced by heating from room tempera- ture to 573 K in a flow of hydrogen and kept at this temperature for 5 h. At this temperature, there is the possibility of reduction of some sulfate groups on S-Z. The reaction products were sampled with a ten- loops injection valve and analyzed by on-line gas chromatography using a 100 m capillary column coated with squalene and a flame ionization detector. From these data, n-octane conversion and yield to the different reaction products (on a carbon basis) were calculated. The selectivity to i species is defined as J.M. Grau, J.M.

At the end of the run with H-MOR, its specific surface area is decreased to 11.3% of the original value and the pore volume is decreased to 46.5%. These values show that coke preferentially blocks the micropores, which are the ones providing most of the surface area. On S-Z, the specific surface area and the pore volume were better preserved along the test, probably due to the lower acid strength and the larger pore diameter. Part of the activity drop of S-Z could be due to a loss of sulfur. 24 J.M. Grau, ZM. Parera/Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 17-27 In situ IR spectroscopy studies [30] showed that a small fraction of the active sites of H-MOR dis- appeared during coke deposition, suggesting that deactivation could be caused by pore blocking rather than by poisoning of the acidic centers. This result is in agreement with ours on the large decrease in specific surface area of H-MOR (from 515 to 58.3 m2/g, Tables 1 and 2) during the run when 4.2% C is deposited. Selectivity values show that the isomerization of n-C8 is very rapid. Silica and chlorided alumina show a poor activity because their acid functions are very weak, being not enough to produce extensive cracking of i-Cs and coking. There is only isomeriza- tion of n-Cs. By increasing the acid strength, hydro- cracking of i-C8 (mainly in the middle of the carbon chain) is produced together with an extensive coke formation. Comparing H-MOR with S-Z, both catalysts are able to produce isomers of C4, C5 and C6 from n-octane. The presence of alkenes in small amounts, Solef, was only observed on the strong acid catalysts. S-Z shows a better isomerization capacity than H-MOR. 3.2. Effect of the metal over Si02 and A1203 Table 3 shows the results of catalytic activity over SiO2 and A1203, neutral and weakly acid supports, respectively, after the addition of Pt or Pd, metals of different hydrogenating capacity. In Figs. 1 and 2, conversion vs. time-on-stream results for these four catalysts are plotted. The results show the influence of both metals on the supports, both supports alone are practically inactive under the reaction conditions. The metal function is the activity supplier because of the practically null acidity of SiO2 and the weak acidity of A1203. The higher activity and coking rate indicate a superior hydrogenating action in Pt than in Pd when loaded over the supports. On A1203, the metal deposi- tion generates a bifunctional catalyst with a weak acidity, but able to produce a little amount of aromatics (benzene and toluene) at a relatively low temperature of reaction. These hydrocarbons are not reported in the table. Using silica as support, the amount of i-C4 obtained is lower than the amount of n-C4. Using alumina, the experimental i-C4/n-C4 and i-Cs/n-C5 ratios are higher than the theoretical ones corresponding to the isomerization thermodynamic equilibrium. This indi- cates that the isomers i-C4 and i-C5 are not produced by the isomerization of the n-C4 or n-C5 produced by cracking of n-Cs, but are produced by the cracking of i-Cs. Some of the carbenium ions of i-Cs must have two branches in order to produce a larger amount of i-C4 than n-Ca upon cracking. 3.3. Effect of the metals over H-MOR and S-Z Table 4 shows results of the catalyst reactivity at 1 and 5 h on stream when Pt and Pd are added over H-MOR and S-Z, both strongly acidic supports. Figs. 1-4 show how the total conversion evolves with time. Comparing Tables 2 and 4, the metal addition produces a large increase in the catalytic activity as well as a decrease in carbon deposition and surface blocking. The proportion of C2 and C3 in the products of reaction increases, indicating the presence of a suc- cessive cracking reaction. The iso/normal ratio for the C4 and C5 paraffins is again higher than the corre- sponding thermodynamic equilibrium values for the isomerization reaction. The increase in activity is larger when Pt is the loaded metal. The presence of Pt reduces the carbon deposited after the 5 h run over H-MOR by 50%, and over S-Z by 84% with respect to the support alone. For the Pd loaded catalysts, reductions are 38.3% and 64%, respectively. Data at 1 and 5 h in Table 4 may lead to wrong conclusions on the influence of the metal in the catalytic activity, because at 1 h already there is a high deactivation of the catalysts. Regarding the initial activity, the figures show that the metal addition produces a large increase in the activity of H-MOR but, practically, does not modify the S-Z activity. There is only an increase in the stability. This phenomenon is due to the effect of the ion sulfate, which largely decreases the metallic activity of Pt. 3.4. Mixtures of H-MOR with Pt or Pd supported on inerts Table 5 shows results of catalytic activity over composite catalysts of H-MOR with Pt and Pd depos- ited on SiO2 and A1203. Figs. 1 and 2 show the J.M. Grau, J.M. Parera/Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 17-27 25 evolution of the total conversion with time. It can be observed that the synergetic effect of the Pt/AlzO3+H- MOR mixture also appears when the support of the metal is changed into SiO2 and Pd is used instead of Pt. Under the operating conditions used, the four mixtures show a higher activity than the single catalysts, H- MOR or metal/silica or metal/alumina. Two are the reasons for this synergism: on one side, the mixture catalyzes the reactions by a bifunctional mechanism, increasing the isomerizing capacity of H-MOR; on the other side, the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydro- carbons decreases the deactivation of the acid micro- porous support produced by the blocking of channels by coke. Another possible effect explaining the decrease in coke content of the mixture and the increase in selectivity to isomers is the formation of activated hydrogen on the metal sites. This hydrogen migrates towards the acid surface thus hydrogenating coke precursors and influencing on the acid reaction mechanism producing an increase in the isomerizing selectivity [39]. If we compare the results of the bifunctional com- posite catalyst with those of the simple one, for the same metal (Pt/SiO2+H-MOR or Pt/AlzO3+H-MOR with Pt/H-MOR, Fig. 1), it can be observed that the composite catalysts have a lower initial activity but the catalyst is more stable along the run, showing a higher activity level at the end of the test. The same behavior is observed with Pt (Fig. 1) or Pd (Fig. 2). The selec- tivity to isomers of the composite catalysts is always higher than that of the simple catalysts. During the first hour of reaction, the activity is lower in the composite catalyst (in comparison with the simple), possibly because of the limitation of the reaction by the inter- particle diffusion of intermediate compounds. As the reaction proceeds, the higher activity of the simple catalyst begins to decay, partly because a part of the surface gets isolated when the access windows to the inner framework of H-MOR become blocked by coke. This phenomenon does not occur in the composite catalyst because a part of the unsaturated precursors produced on the metal sites is deposited on the inert supports, A1203 or SiO2, not producing deactivation. On the other hand, in the composite catalyst, the metal on the inert macroporous support remains accessible to the reactants and the rate of activated hydrogen production is not decreased. This activated hydrogen produces a constant elimination of coke precursors that cannot reach the acid sites in micro- pores. 3.5. Mixtures of Z-S with Pt or Pd supported on inerts Table 6 shows the results of the catalytic activity for the composite catalysts of S-Z with Pt and Pd deposited over SiO2 or A1203. Figs. 3 and 4 show the evolution of the total conversion with time-on- stream. We can see that the four mixtures of S-Z with a metal supported on an inert solid produce a material with a lower catalytic activity than Pt/S-Z or Pd/S-Z and even lower than S-Z in the first hour of reaction. In this case, the synergetic action compared to S-Z can be caused by the probable change of the reaction mechanism and, mainly, to the decrease in the rate of coke deposition over the active sites. Values of specific surface area and pore volume for the compo- site catalysts during the reaction indicate that their decrease is small and that the blocking of pores is negligible. The support S-Z with no metal function is deactivated by poisoning with coke, and is more sensitive to the amount of deposited carbon than H- MOR. The higher sensibility to the carbon deposit can be justified by the lower specific surface area of S-Z in comparison with H-MOR and the different active sites. Composite catalysts with S-Z present the highest selectivity to isomers and the synergy produced by Pd is lower than the one of Pt. 4. Conclusions H-MOR and S-Z have very different textural prop- erties. H-MOR has a very high specific surface area produced by very narrow parallel pores which are not interconnected, whereas S-Z has a very wide distribu- tion of irregular and interconnected pores. Both cata- lysts are rapidly deactivated at the beginning of a run with n-octane due to the deposition of coke or poly- merized compounds. The deposition of coke in H-MOR produces pore blocking, decreasing the specific surface area from 515 to 58.3 mZ/g. Even the deposition of coke per unit surface is larger in S-Z than in H-MOR, there is no pore blocking by coke and the decrease in the available surface is APCATA 97000793 S0926-860X(97)00079-3 10.1016/S0926-860X(97)00079-3 Article Single and composite bifunctional catalysts of H-MOR or SO4 2−ZrO2 for n-octane hydroisomerization-cracking.

Tel.: 54 42 533858; fax: 54 42 531068/550944 The performances of two materials with different acidic and textural properties, H-Mordenite and SO4 2−ZrO2, are compared in the hydroisomerization-cracking of n-octane at 573 K and 1.5 MPa, aiming at the production of light isomers. To obtain a bifunctional catalyst, a metallic function (Pt or Pd) is added either to the acid material or in a composite catalyst prepared by mixing the acid materials with either metal/SiO2 or metal/Al2O3. The synergy of functions produces catalysts more selective to isomers. Since the deactivation by pore blockage decreases, the composite catalysts with H-Mordenite present an improved stability. The composite catalysts with SO4 2−ZrO2 do not present this improvement because of their wide pore size distribution.
