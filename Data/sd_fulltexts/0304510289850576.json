KIWI Institut de Chimie Physique, Ecole Polytechnique Federate de Lausanne, 1015 Ecublens (Switzerland) and P. ITALIANO Microstructure Laboratory, Carlo Erba Strumentazione, Rodano, Milan (Italy) (Received March 19,1988; accepted May 20,1988) Summary Pt TiOz Degussa catalysts are produced by a deposition-precipitation technique which continuously makes available hydroxyl ions via urea hydro- lysis. The Pt dispersions, obtained with fairly uniform size distributions as seen by electron microscopy, consist of Pt clusters 25 4 A in size. Through photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA), various Pt 4f 7/2 peaks have been detected which show different oxidation states for catalysts obtained under different experimental conditions. In situ measurements performed on these catalysts revealed Pt , Pf*\"2 and Pt14 species, proving that positive centers (Pt^) are formed and stabilized at the catalyst surface. Mesoporosity de- velops on TiOz due to Pt deposition, showing 128 and 158 A mesopores. These discretely sized pores contribute to the specific pore volume of the TiOa P-25 substrate, increasing the specific pore volume from 0.116 to 0.384 cm3 g~1 for a 1% Pt-loaded catalyst. Introduction The preparation of Pt TiO; catalyts for hydrogenation and dehydro- genation processes is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry, m order to utilize the expensive active component (Pt) most efficiently, the deposition of this active material over the support should be carefully controlled, and therefore it is useful to understand the factors responsible for adequate catalytic activity. This study is concerned with the use of ESCA, physisorption, chemi- sorption, mercury porosimetry, electron microscopy and temperature- programmed desorption (quadrupole detector) to allow a reliable and prag- matic characterization of the catalyst microstructure. m this way, a com- prehensive catalyst study is sought through specific surface area, cumulative 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 132 pore volume, pore sizes and distribution, surface metal dispersion, Pt cluster size and relative H Pt bonding energies. Evaluating the Hz chemisorption and desorption taking place will allow us to describe the features of these catalysts in hydrogenation processes. Experimental section Catalyst preparation For a 1% Pt TiO; catalyst, an adequate amount of H^PtClg is added to 250 cm3 of water and 0.5 g of urea. The support is added at 90 C. Since at room temperature the urea solution does not hydrolyse markedly, trials were conducted above 70 C to determine at what temperature rapid hydrolysis of urea takes place. After 8 h, the suspension was filtered, washed with 10~3 M HC1 and dried. Reduction by an Ar/H; stream was subsequently carried out at 350 C for 18 h. Since urea hydrolysis [1, 2] continuously provides hydroxyl ions to the solution, the homogeneous increase in the hydroxyl Qf\\ /~* HzN CO NHz + 3H20 > 2NH^ + CO; + 20H~ (1) ion concentration leads to hydrolysis of the H^PtCl^ The TiO^ yields cationic Ti OH\"1\" sites for chloroplatinic acid adsorption at pH 6.5. A marked increase in pH is observed during the preparation, due to the continuous generation of OH~ ions. These OH\" ions released during urea hydrolysis com- pete with Cl~ ions for the adsorption sites of the support. This competition leads to a fairly uniform distribution of small particles over the TiO^ sus- pended in the solution [1, 3, 4]. In this way, agglomeration of negatively charged Pt species on any anchoring site of the support is avoided. Methods and techniques The surface of the catalysts (physisorption, chemisorption, mercury porosimetry, temperature-programmed desorption) was characterized by a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1900 fully computerized system. As these surface measurements should involve impurity-free surfaces, all samples were pro- treated for 1 h at 250 C with He, then for 2 h at 350 C with H; and finally under vacuum at 350 C for 3 h (10~4 torr) before use. In this way, all adsorbed and chemisorbed water held on the TiOz surface was completely removed. Photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) was carried out using a Leybold Heraeus instrument and Mg K.a line at 1253.6 eV. The base pres- sure of the spectrometer was 10\"10 m'bar and during the measurements 2 X 10~8 mbar. The analyzed area was 1.5 cm2. For spectrometer calibration, the Au 4f 7/2 peak at 84.0 eV (Mg K.a, ) was used. Binding energies for the catalysts reported in Fig. 1 were referenced to the Ti 2p 3/2 peak (458.5 eV). Electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out with a Phillips-300S in- strument. The limit of resolution for such an instrument is 3 A. The amplifi- cation attained was 390 000 at 100 kV. 133 Results and discussion Photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) measurements were carried out with 0.5 and 1% Pt-urea hydrolysed and reduced samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The shift observed in the experimental peaks shown in Fig. 1 reflects the existence of Pt species having different oxidation states. These positions for Pt in different chemical states are well known, see e.g. [5 -10]. In particular, the system Pt TiO^ has been well described recently in surface analysis studies [11 -13]. For the evaluation of the XPS spectra, the follow- ing values were used [7 -11] for Pt 4f 7/2: 70.9 eV for Pt , 72.4 eV for Pt(II), and 74.8 eV for Pt(IV). These energies are marked with an arrow in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. (a) ESCA spectrum of the Pt 4f region tor a 1% Pt TiQi urea hydrolysed un- reduced catalyst; (b) ESCA spectrum of the Pt 4f region for a 0.3% Pt TiO; urea hydro- lysed reduced catalyst at 350 C; (c) ESCA spectrum of the Pt 4f region for a 1% Pt TiOz urea hydrolysed reduced catalyst at 350 C. ESCA measurements were carried out 'in situ', reducing the samples shown in traces b and c for 2 h with H; in the ESCA prechamber. Only then were the samples transferred to the high vacuum chamber. The peak posi- tions and the electrostatic charging of the samples were determined, refer- encing to the 0 Is and Ti 2p signals. Trace a indicates the 1% unreduced Pt/- TiOa ESCA spectrum, which consists almost entirely of Pt(II) species with the Pt 4f 7/2 - 5/2 doublet and having binding energies (B.E.) of 72.4 and 75.7 eV respectively. The experimental curve a was deconvoluted by a Gaussian generator. The results showed >85% signal corresponding to Pt(II) species, and the rest consisting of Pt(IV). The asymmetry found in this doublet indicated that two distinct species give rise to this spectrum. A note 134 of caution is necessary here, since it has been reported that Pt(IV) species are reduced under X-ray beam [10]. Curve b shows the 0.3% Pt/TiO; reduced ESCA spectrum. The shift of the experimental peaks toward lower binding energies reflects the existence of Pt species having lower oxidation states. Curve b represents a composite doublet having mainly a Pt(0) component (>60%), the residual component being Pt(II). Curve c represents the 1% Pt/Ti02 reduced material. From the features of this ESCA spectrum, it is apparent that the zero-valent state predominates. Moreover, deconvolution of the asymmetric doublet shows >90% Pt(0) species, the rest consisting of Pt(II) ionic species. The experimental results obtained show that the reduction of PtCl^\"2 by urea (curve a) and later by H; (under the conditions described in the experimental part) is incomplete. Our ESCA results do not allow an un- equivocal identification of the nature of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) clusters on the TiC>2 surface as a result of the hydrolysis [14]. On the basis of our findings, it is possible to state that catalytic Pt deposition is preceded by a strong adsorption of Pt(IV) species on the Ti02 surface [4]. Partial reduction of Pt(II) and simultaneous conversion (in the time of hydrolysis) of these chlorides to the oxides, oxychloride or hydroxides would take place, as previously suggested [15], but neither the exact composition nor the struc- ture of the complex formed is known [3]. One must take into account in Fig. 1 that the XPS of small metal clusters compared with spectra of macroscopic samples show smaller peak symmetry and more pronounced line broadening [16 -18]. A shifting of the Pt 4f 7/2 - 5/2 doublet to higher binding energies may not only be caused by varying oxidation states. An electrostatic charging of the TiO; carrier also takes place. TiO^ undergoes a distinct electronic valence change from Ti\"1'4 to Ti'1\"3 [19, 20]. Strong metal/support interactions [21] and the formation of PtaTi [22] have also been reported for Pt/TiOa systems. On the basis of these findings, one may speculate on the step occurring during the preparation of the catalyst shown in Fig. 1: adsorption of PtCl^\"2 and PtCl4~2 onto TiO^ followed by conversion (during the time of hydro- lysis) to the oxides, hydroxides or oxychlorides and finally thermally as- sisted Ha reduction to Pt(0). The existence of Pt(II) under these conditions reveals the stable nature of lower Pt ionic species obtained during the 90 C hydrolysis on TiO;. Figure 2 presents H; adsorption isotherms at ambient temperature, showing the sequence for H; chemisorbed volume as the loading of Pt in- creases on the catalyst surface. As expected, the highest H; chemisorption is obtained at 1% loading. This is also the Pt loading that has been found to have maximum H; adsorption activity, as will be seen later. Calculating the dispersion (see chapters 5,6 in [3]) for a 1% Pt TiOa catalyst that adsorbs 0.29 cm3 H; g~1 as shown by the upper trace in Fig. 2, one arrives at almost 50% dispersion for Pt clusters on TiOa support. For loadings of 0.3% and 0.15% Pt on TiO;, dispersions of 55% and 58% were found to lie within exper- imental error.The catalyst 1% Pt TiOa reduced at 600 C is shown by a dashed 135 H, adsorbed volume (cm'/g of support) ____--- 1%Pt-600 C 03 - _ .-- \"\" 1% pi - awe ^ / / 0. / ( I I 01- ^ 0.3%Pt-350 C f! -7 ^ ^__^ ^_^ __ 0.15% Pt - 350 C 00 01 2 345 Equilibrium pressure (mm Hg) Fig. 2.

The total chemisorbed hydrogen up to 5 torr is shown. line in Fig. 2. Extrapolating the linear segment of the chemisorption isotherm gives an intersection value of 0.26 cm3 g~1. A 44% dispersion is calculated from this value. These results indicate that the way in which Ha is chem- isorbed on this catalyst changes from the 1% Pt TiO; catalyst reduced at lower temperature (350 C), showing quite different initial slopes for these two temperatures below 1 torr. Reduction at higher temperatures leads to sintering and loss of dispersion in supports such as AL^ and SiOa [3]. Therefore, it is not surprising that it occurs on TiO^ as reported here. From these experimental observations, it can also be inferred that H; adsorption in the two cases at low pressures follows a different mechanism. To a certain extent, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is in- volved in the results reported in Fig. 2. These catalysts were prepared as described in the Experimental Section, reduced at 350 and 600 C, stored in air and conditioned subsequently for chemisorption at He, H; and vacuum at 350 \"C. Tauster et al. [21] observed suppression of chemisorption with Pt TiO; catalysts when reduced at 500 C, and complete hydrogen chem- isorption in catalysts reduced at 200 C; 350 C lies between the temperature limits of SMSI known for Pt TiOa catalysts. Therefore, H; chemisorption is possible at this temperature, and some SMSI effect is present, as shown in Fig. 2. Precipitation from homogeneous solution can yield high dispersion and fairly uniform particle size distribution, often as a direct result of com- pound formation with the support [1-3]. This is shown in Fig. 3, where 25 4 A Pt clusters are given. Electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out 136 Fig. 3. Electron micrograph of a 1% Pt TiO; with 390 000 magnification. Pt clusters shown are 25 A in size. with a Philips 300S instrument at 100 kV having a resolution of 3 A. Figure 4a shows the pore size distribution for unloaded Ti02-P25 Degussa as used throughout this work. Hg porosimetry up to 2000 psi was used. Two distinct regions or porosity are seen in this figure for the unloaded support. A discrete number of supermesopores [3, 23, 24] centered at 200 A is observed. At the right-hand side, interparticle porosity is observed to be present at about 50 000 A. Figure 4b shows the cumulative pore size and distribution for Ti02-P25 Degussa measured by N2 physisorption. To further characterize these mesopores, N2 physisorption was carried out on a 1% Pt Ti02 catalyst. Results are presented in Fig. 5a, focusing in the mesopore region. Assuming a cylindrical pore model [8] and the absence of micropores for the computation of pore size distribution, 158 A and 128 A mesopores developed in the catalyst due to Pt deposition. Microporosity centered around 20 A is observed on the left-hand side of this figure. It is more pro- nounced than similar types of microporosity reported in Fig. 4b for Ti02- P25 Degussa alone, indicating that a meaningful modification takes place on the surface of titania during catalyst preparation. These discrete size mesopores render a 1% Pt Ti02 with a specific pore volume of 0.384 cm3 g~1 as compared to a value of 0.116 cm3 g~1 for Ti02-P25 Degussa alone. The pore volume in the loaded catalyst increased to some degree due to the for- mation of a discrete number of pores. These pores were relatively large due to Pt deposition, as previously described. Isotherms of the type IV were obtained for Ti02-P25 and loadings of 0.25, 0.5 and 1% Pt. Applying the B.E.T. equation and J.B.S. pore size distribution model [23], the surface area values obtained were 50, 49.5 and 51 m2 g~1, respectively. 137 Cumulative volume (mm'/g) (a) 103 10\" Pore radius (A) Cumulative volume (cm'/g) 0.400 - 0.300 0.200 0.100 (b) 100 200 Pore radius (A) 300 Fig. 4.

Here it is shown that Pt-loaded particles of less than 0.6 p do not exist in a 1% Pt TiOz catalyst. This particle size is quite different from the size (0.02 p.) known for single particles in polycrystalline Ti02-P25 Degussa [3]. There- 138 fore, agglomeration of single support units takes place during catalyst prepa- ration with particle sizes ranging from 30 to 5000 polycrystalline titania units. Bulk density of 0.9566 g cm\"3 and a total porosity of 72.125% has been determined for this catalyst. Chemisorption isotherms were carried out on a 1% Pt TiOz catalyst pretreated in the standard way and results are shown in Fig. 6a. As seen in this figure, 2/3 of the hydrogen adsorption capacity originates from the Pt microstructure deposited on TiO; (which is the catalytically active compo- nent) and only 1/3 originates from the support. The results reported for the metal in Fig. 6a show the difference between direct measurements on Pt TiOa and TiOa materials at each equilibrium pressure. Figure 6b shows that Langmuir isotherm behaviour takes place when pressures up to 5 torr in hydrogen are applied on a 1% Pt TiO; catalyst. The correlation factor found for such a fit was 0.9993, and is indicated in Fig. 6b. Such behaviour is consistent with mechanisms involving hydrogen generation with this type of catalyst when suspensions are irradiated under light. An account of this process has been reported recently (see [14] and references therein). Cumulative volume (cm3^) (MOO- Q.300 0.200 0)00 Fig. 5(a).

Conclusions This work shows the characterization of a Pt microstructure when this metal is dispersed via deposition-precipitation on TiO; techniques. The pore structure of the support material changes due to the deposition of Pt. We report here for the first time via in situ ESCA techniques that urea hydro- lysis of chloroplatinic acid yields to a considerable degree Pt(II)-ionic species on TiC>2. At relatively low temperatures, the nature of the pores on the loaded catalyst was examined to identify the type and dimensions of the active catalytic sites.

        "dc:description": "Pt-TiO2 Degussa catalysts are produced by a deposition-precipitation technique which continuously makes available hydroxyl ions via urea hydrolysis. The Pt dispersions, obtained with fairly uniform size distributions as seen by electron microscopy, consist of Pt clusters 25 ±4 Å in size. Through photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA), various Pt 4f 7 2 peaks have been detected which show different oxidation states for catalysts obtained under different experimental conditions. In situ measurements performed on these catalysts revealed Pto, Pt+2 and P+2 species, proving that positive centers Pt+n are formed and stabilized at the catalyst surface. Mesoporosity develops on TiO2 due to Pt deposition, showing 128 and 158 Å mesopores. These discretely sized pores contribute to the specific pore volume of the TiO2 P-25 substrate, increasing the specific pore volume from 0.116 to 0.384 cm3 g−1 for a 1% Pt-loaded catalyst.",
