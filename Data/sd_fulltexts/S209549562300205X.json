Graphical abstract In metal-air batteries, the size of the ionic radius determines the behavior of the differential electrochemical reactions. Understanding alkali metal ions' (e.g., Li+/Na+/K+) transport mechanism is challenging but critical to improving the performance of alkali metal batteries. Herein using α-MnO2 nanowires as cathodes, the transport kinetics of Li+/Na+/K+ in the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2 with a growth direction of [001] is revealed. We show that ion radius plays a decisive role in determining the ion transport and electrochemistry. Regardless of the ion radii, Li+/Na+/K+ can all go through the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2, generating large stress and causing channel merging or opening. However, smaller ions such as Li+ and Na+ cannot only transport along the [001] direction but also migrate along the < 110 > direction to the nanowire surface; for large ion such as K+, diffusion along the < 110 > direction is prohibited. The different ion transport behavior has grand consequences in the electrochemistry of metal oxygen batteries (MOBs). For Li-O2 battery, Li+ transports uniformly to the nanowire surface, forming a uniform layer of oxide; Na+ also transports to the nanowire surface but may be clogged locally due to its larger radius, therefore sporadic pearl-like oxides form on the nanowire surface; K+ cannot transport to the nanowire surface due to its large radius, instead, it breaks the nanowire locally, causing local deposition of potassium oxides. The study provides atomic scale understanding of the alkali metal ion transport mechanism which may be harnessed to improve the performance of MOBs. Keywords Ion transport In-situ TEM STEM Metal oxygen batteries Metal ion batteries 1 Introduction With the booming development of modern industrial society and the looming crisis of fossil availability, the need for rechargeable batteries with high energy density comparable to gasoline is increasingly urgent [1]. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in mobile applications, such as portable electronics and electric vehicles, however, the limited energy density of current LIBs does not meet the demands for the long time operation of portable electronics, electric vehicles and even electric aircrafts [2–7]. Metal-oxygen rechargeable batteries (MORBs) have high theoretical specific energy capacity, i.e. 3600 Wh kg−1 based on Li2O2 product for Li-O2 batteries (LOBs) [8,9], 1610 Wh kg−1 based on Na2O2 for Na-O2 batteries (SOBs) and 935 Wh kg−1 based on KO2 for K-O2 batteries (POBs) [10–17]. However, the main challenges in developing MORBs are the lack of understanding of the atomic-scale ion transport mechanisms and the electrochemical reaction mechanisms [18]. Manganese oxides have unique advantages as cathode materials for MORBs owing to their low toxicity, low cost, abundant resources, as well as high catalytic activity for both ORR and OER [19–21]. Moreover, the channel structure of α-MnO2 (“hollandite MnO2″, body-centered tetragonal with I4/m space group) which has one-dimensional 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 channels intergrown along c axis, offers a great template to study the atomic-scale ions transport mechanisms [20]. Au shows great catalysis activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and allows the reaction to occur at lower overpotential [22]. Therefore, Au is widely used as a catalyst in energy storage field. Recently, Guo et al. successfully decreased the interfacial resistance between Ag nanowires cathode and solid electrolyte Li6.4La3Zr2.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZO) by thermal evaporation technology introduction of an Au layer on the surface of LLZTO in LOB [23]. In addition, Tang et al. using the Au-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) as cathode in LOB, indicated the lithium-gold alloy (Li15Au4) catalyzed the stable LiO2 generation [24]. Meanwhile, Au-coated α-MnO2 nanowires were used as the cathode in SOB, and it was shown that Au catalyzed the NaO2 formation during the ORR process for SOB [25]. It is noted that α-MnO2 cathode has poor electronic conductivity, which limits its application, so Au coating on α-MnO2 not only catalyzes the electrochemical reactions but also improves the electronic conductivity of α-MnO2 electrode material. Therefore, α-MnO2 has been used as the electrode material for both metal ion batteries (MIBs) and MORBs [25–30]. The electrochemical energy storage device relies on reversible electrochemical reactions. Upon the insertion of working ions into the α-MnO2 electrode material, the formation of an A-O-Mn ionic bond with structural oxygen atoms occurs, where A denotes alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+). Furthermore, an increase in the ion radius leads to an increase in the intercalation potential [31,32], which implies a different transport behavior of alkali metal ions in the tunnels of α-MnO2. Herein, using α-MnO2 nanowires as a template, the atomic-scale ion transport mechanisms were revealed. In addition to studying the ion transport mechanisms in bare α-MnO2 nanowires, those in the noble metal Au nanoclusters coated α-MnO2 nanowires (Au@α-MnO2 nanowires) via ionic sputtering were also investigated. Nano-MORBs with alkali metals as anodes (Li, Na and K), alkali metal oxides as solid electrolytes, and either bare α-MnO2 or Au@α-MnO2 as cathodes, were assembled using a transmission electron microscopy - scanning channeling microscopy (TEM-STM) platform in an environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) with O2 ambient. The morphological evolution of the α-MnO2 was monitored in real time by in-situ TEM techniques. Moreover, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy - high angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis were performed to reveal the ion transport pathways in α-MnO2. During discharge, cations firstly intercalated into α-MnO2 channels to form A x MnO2 (A represents Li, Na, K; 0 < x < 1) like an MIB, then migrated to the nanowire surface to react with O2. However, the mode of ionic transport from the inner channels to the surface is different, and has a strong dependence on the size of the ions. For LOB, the radius of Li+ ion is relatively small, and it is easy to transport to the surface and react with O2 to form an even oxide layer on the nanowire surface. For SOB, Na+ transport may be clogged locally, causing the formation of uneven pearl-like oxide bulbs. For POB, the internal stress induced collapse of internal channels and even microcracks in the nanowire, and the ORR product formed dome-like oxide locally. In all cases, the nanowires with channel structure (α-MnO2 for an example) act as an ionic pump, which continuously transporting the cations from the inner nanowires to the surface to relieve internal stress and thus enhance the battery performance [33]. Our work reveals the atomic-scale transport mechanism of Li+/Na+/K+ metal ions which may guide the development of high energy density alkali metal batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Electrode materials preparation The α-MnO2 nanowires synthesis: 6.25 mM KMnO4 and 2.5 mM MnSO4 H2O were mixed thoroughly in deionized water under constant stirring for several min, and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated via vacuum drying oven at 160 °C for 12 h [26]. The synthesized nanowires were collected through centrifuge and then washed with deionized water and ethyl alcohol several times. The final product was dried at 60 °C in air. The as-synthesized nanowires were first soaked in HNO3 solution accompanied by magnetic stirring (800 r/min. at 60 °C) for 1 and 4 days. This procedure was followed by repeated washing of the nanowires with deionized water until the solution was neutralized (pH≈7). These nanowires were finally heated at 280 °C in air. According to literature, 280 °C dry heating is efficient in removal of any residual water in the tunnels [34–37]. 2.2 Nanobattery assembly The nanobattery was constructed through a two-probe configuration in a Cs-corrected ETEM (FEI, Titan G2, 300 kV). α-MnO2 nanowires were glued to an aluminum (Al) rod with conductive epoxy first. The Au nanoparticles were coated on the glued α-MnO2 nanowire via ion sputtering, and the Au-coated α-MnO2 (Au@α-MnO2) nanowires were used as the working cathode. alkali metal (Li/Na/K) scratched on an Al tip inside a glove box filled with argon gas was used as the reference and counter electrode. The native alkali metal oxide (Li2O/Na2O/K2O) layer formed on the surface of the alkali metal was used as a solid electrolyte for Li+/Na+/K+ transportation. Both Au@α-MnO2 and alkali metal electrodes were mounted onto a TEM-STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) holder (Pico Femto FE-F20 holder) inside a glove box. Then the holder was sealed in a home-built air-tight bag filled with dry argon and transferred to the TEM. The total time of exposure to the air was less than 2 s, which limited the extent of alkali metal oxide formation on the surface of the alkali metal. Prior to the experiment, high-purity O2 (99.99%) was introduced to the specimen chamber with a pressure of 1.0 mbar. The Au@α-MnO2 nanowire was manipulated to approach the oxide layer, and then a potential was applied to the nanowire versus the alkali metal electrode to either charge or discharge the nanowire. Real-time visualization of the structural and phase changes of the Au@α-MnO2 nanowires can be correlated directly to the electrochemical reactions based on the above configuration. If the elongations for the α-MnO2 nanowire during the discharge were ignored, the radial expansion rate was calculated via the increasing of the diameter of the nanowire using the following Eq. (1). (1) R in = π R 2 - r 2 ÷ π r 2 = R 2 - r 2 r 2 where R in, R and r represent the volume expansion rate, the final and the initial radius of the α-MnO2 nanowire, respectively. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The slurry was made by mixing α-MnO2, PVDF binder and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a weight ratio of 7:1:2 in N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The resulting slurry was cast on copper foil via doctor blade and dried at 110 °C in a vacuum. Working electrodes were punched with a diameter of 11 mm and the average mass loadings of active materials were 1–1.5 mg cm−2. Batteries were assembled with 2032 stainless steel coin cells, with metal Li as counter electrodes and Celgard 2400 (Celgard, USA) as a separator. The electrolyte were LiPF6 in EC and DEC for lithium-ion battery, NaClO4 in EC and DEC for sodium-ion battery and KPF6 in EC and DEC for potassium-ion battery. The electrochemical performance was tested using a battery testing system (LAND, CT3001A) over the voltage window of 0.01–3 V (versus. Li/Li+, Na/Na+, K/K+). All cells were tested at 25 °C. CV tests were conducted on a Princeton 4000 electrochemical workstation at different scanning rates from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 mV/s in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V (versus. Li/Li+, Na/Na+, K/K+). Conventional alkali metal–O2 battery using CR2032-type coin cells were cycled on a LAND CT3001A multichannel battery testing system. A slurry, which was prepared by mixing Ketjen Black (KB, 30 wt%), Au/α-MnO2 or α-MnO2 nanowires (60 wt%) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 10 wt%), was first pasted on the carbon paper and then used as the cathode of the coin cell battery. All the cells were assembled under an argon atmosphere by using clean alkali metal foils as the anode, a glass-fiber as the separator. The electrolytes were LiPF6 in EC and DEC for lithium-O2 battery, NaClO4 in EC and DEC for sodium-O2 battery and KPF6 in EC and DEC for potassium-O2 battery. The gravimetric capacity and current densities were calculated based on the mass of α-MnO2. 2.4 Preparation of TEM cross-section samples The as-synthesized and alkali metal ions-intercalated α-MnO2 nanowires were first mixed with resin and hardener for embedding. The mixture was transferred into an oven and kept at 60 °C for 12 h to dry the mixture. Ultramicrotomy was carried out in a Leica Ultra-Thin cutting device using a diamond knife with a step size of 400 nm. Slices after cutting were directly transferred to Cu grids with thin carbon supporting membrane for STEM-HAADF (Titan cubed Themis Z 300 kV, Thermo-Fisher scientific) observation [26]. 2.5 Computation methods All the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted with the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP) using projector augmented waves (PAW) pseudo potentials [38,39]. The exchange-correction energy was described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) model under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [40]. The cutoff energy of 500 eV, and the convergence criteria for the ionic and the electronic relaxation were set to 0.02 eV Å−1 and 10–5 eV, respectively. Besides, gamma-centered k-point mesh with 1 × 1 × 1 was chosen. For the density of states (DOS) calculation, gamma-centered k-point mesh with reciprocal space resolution of 2π × 0.02 Å−1 was chosen. Using CP2K package, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted to the optimize the structure [41]. Hybrid Gaussian and plane waves method as implemented in the Quickstep module was used, with a cutoff of 300 Ry. DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis set in combination with GTH pseudopotentials is utilized for all atoms [42]. Time step for simulation was 1 fs, and the simulation was carried out using the canonical ensemble (NVT) with the optimized structure in DFT procedure. The temperature of the simulation system was controlled at 300 K. 3 Results and discussion The pristine structure of α-MnO2 and Au@α-MnO2 are shown in Fig. 1 . Low-magnification STEM-HAADF images and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 1a-e) show that Au nanoparticles (1–10 nm) were uniformly coated on the α-MnO2 nanowire surface by ionic sputtering (Fig. 1a). The atomic resolution STEM-HAADF images of the Au@α-MnO2 are shown in Fig. 1(f-j). The α-MnO2 nanowire is orientated at the [113] zone axis with a growth direction of [001] (Fig. 1g, with the corresponding fast Fourier transformation (FFT) shown in Fig. 1h). A dome-shaped Au nanoparticle with size of about 2 nm orientated at [101] zone axis attaches on the surface of α-MnO2 epitaxially (Fig. 1i, with the corresponding FFT shown in Fig. 1j). Fig. 1(k and l) shows the cross-section of the pristine α-MnO2 nanowire from the [001] orientation. The nanowire has an irregular surface with several facets. Atomic resolution STEM-HAADF image shows that the pristine MnO2 possess ideal 1 × 1 (1.9 Å×1.9 Å) and 2 × 2 (4.6 Å×4.6 Å) atomic channels (Fig. 1k and l) [20,26], which match well with the atomic model of α-MnO2. While the literature indicated that the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2 were stabilized by large cations, such as K+, Ba2+, NH4 +, among others, our observations from the STEM-HAADF images after acid treatment showed no apparent K signal in the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2 [20,26,43,44]. However, further intensity line profile analysis of the STEM-HAADF images indicated that some channels actually have a weak K signal (marked by the black arrows in the Fig. S1). This finding implies that a small amount of K may stabilize the entire channel structure. Moreover, the K signal in the channels was stronger before acid treatment than after acid treatment. The abundant channel structure provides ion transport express ways in MIBs and MORBs. To monitor the electrochemical reaction process of MORBs (LOB, SOB and POB) and elucidate the electrochemical reaction mechanisms in real time, all-solid-state MORBs comprised of Au@α-MnO2 nanowires based O2 cathode, naturally formed alkali metal oxides on the surfaces of alkali metals as electrolytes, and alkali metals as anodes were assembled in an ETEM operating under O2 ambient. For the LOB, when a negative potential was applied to the Au@α-MnO2 nanowire cathode, the nanowire began to bend along the longitudinal direction (Fig. 2 a-d and Supplementary Movie S1), resulting from the Li+ intercalation into the channels of nanowires to form Li x 1MnO2 (Fig. S2a-d, 0.53 < x 1 < 0.91). Li+ insertion induced change of valence state of Mn was confirmed by the white-line intensity ratio (L3/L2) from the electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) of Mn-L2,3 (Supplementary Table 1) [45–48]. With increasing discharge depth (d and I), a uniform thin layer appeared on the surface of the nanowire with a radial expansion of 65% (diameter from 35 to 45 nm, the calculation was given in Methods). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and EELS indicate that the thin layer was Li2O2 (Fig. S2a-d). These results suggest that Li+ is firstly inserted into α-MnO2, and then transported to the surface and reacted with O2 to form Li2O2 in the discharge process. We also detected the existence of AuLi3 (Fig. S2b), indicating that the formation of Li2O2 was accompanied by the lithiation of Au. To further study the role of Au in the discharge process, a control experiment with bare α-MnO2 cathode under O2 ambient was conducted (Fig. S3 a-e and Supplementary Movie S2). The bare α-MnO2 was bent at the initial stage and then split (Fig. S3d marked by a white arrow) followed by growing to a large ball with α-MnO2 broken into tiny pieces distributed at the outer rim of the ball. The result indicates that defects might form inside the α-MnO2 channels due to lithiation caused local stress. The control experiment suggests that coating of Au improved the electronic conductivity, leading to rapid pumping of Li+ to the nanowire surface thus alleviating the build up of chemomechanical stress in the nanowire interior. The discharge/charge processes and product characterization of the bare α-MnO2 were examined using SAED and EELS, as depicted in Fig. S4. The discharge process (Fig. S4 a-c) was found to cause radial expansion and axial bending of the nanowire due to intercalation of lithium ions, resulting in an uneven oxide layer on the nanowire surface. The main discharge products were identified as Li2O2 and Li x 3MnO2 (1.15 < x 3 < 1.32) through SAED (Fig. S4g) and EELS (Fig. S4h and i) analyses. During the charging process (Fig. S4d-f), the oxide layer disintegrated to form discontinuous nanospheres, and the charge products were identified as Li2O and Li x 4MnO2 (0.61 < x 4 < 1.12) through SAED (Fig. S4j) and EELS (Fig. S4k and l) analyses. The values of x 3 and x 4 were determined through quantitative EELS analysis and are presented in Supplementary Table 1. In comparison to the Au@α-MnO2 cathode, Li2O2 discharge products could not be completely decomposed into Li+ and oxygen without the catalytic action of Au. This suggests that Au catalyzed the discharging products’ decomposition. To further clarify the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the LOB, lithiation of Au@α-MnO2 cathode under vacuum was also conducted (Fig. S5), which showed bending and swelling of the nanowire during the discharge process, and the discharge product was AuLi3 and Li x 1MnO2 (Fig. S5f and Supplementary Movie S3). The existence of AuLi3 suggests that Li+ in the α-MnO2 channel can rapidly transport to the surface and alloy with Au, thus avoiding the Li+ accumulation induced cracking of α-MnO2. Therefore, the Au particles on the α-MnO2 surface cannot only improve the electronic conductivity and electrochemical reaction rate, but also rapidly alloy with the extracted Li+ from the α-MnO2 channels, providing a fast channel for the subsequent reaction between Li+ and O2. When a reversed bias was applied, the α-MnO2 nanowire became straight, and the oxide layer on the surface almost disappeared, and the morphology almost returned to that of the pristine Au@α-MnO2 (Fig. 2e-g and II). The SAED and EELS confirmed that the products were Li2O2, Li x 2MnO2 (0.61 < x 2 < 0.99) and Au3Li. A small amount of residual Li2O2 should be ascribed to the incomplete decomposition of the discharge products (Fig. S2e-h). The transition from AuLi3 to Au3Li should be ascribed to the dealloying of Li-Au alloy during charging. And the slight change between the Li x 1MnO2 and Li x 2MnO2, being confirmed by valence state analysis (Supplementary Table 1), indicates that the α-MnO2 can serve as an ion transport channel during the discharge and charge process, mimicking an ionic pump for LOB. To understand the effect of the electronic structure of the Au@α-MnO2 interface on Li oxidation, an Au@α-MnO2 interface structure was constructed. Subsequently, the density of states (DOS) of the α-MnO2 (Fig. S6b), Au (Fig. S6c), and the interface of Au and α-MnO2 (Fig. S6d) were calculated by density function theory (DFT). The DOS results indicated that the Au nanoparticles coating on α-MnO2 decreased the bandgap of α-MnO2 and improved its electronic conductivity. Therefore, Au coating facilitated the oxidation reduction reaction, i.e. the formation of Li2O2. In the subsequent cycles for LOB, the nanobattery showed good reversibility. The morphology evolution was similar to the first cycle. The nanowire bent during discharge and became flat during charge (Fig. S7 and Supplementary Movie S1). Note that only 10% of radial expansion for the second (Fig. S7a-c) and 5% for the third discharge processes (Fig. S7g-i) were observed, which are much less than that at the first discharge (65%) (Fig. 2a-d), suggesting that the lithiation of α-MnO2 in the first cycle might not be fully reversible, and it only acted as a Li+ transport pathway in the subsequent discharge/charge cycles. Therefore, the volume expansion in the subsequent cycles was mainly caused by the alloying reaction of Au on the surface of the nanowires. Note that a thicker layer of Li2O2 was produced at the third discharge (Fig. S7g-i), which almost disappeared at a charge (Fig. S7j-l), indicating that the decomposition of Li2O2 was reversible. Additional results of rechargeable Li-Au@MnO2 LOB shown in Fig. S8 and Supplementary Movie S4 confirms these observations. In order to verify the cycling performance improvement by Au coating on α-MnO2, coin-type batteries using bare α-MnO2 and Au@α-MnO2 as cathode were cycled, as shown in Fig. S9(a and b). The results showed that Au-coated α-MnO2 significantly improved their cycling performance and reduced the polarization of the batteries with varying degrees, especially for LOB. The smaller polarization of Au@α-MnO2 electrode (Fig. S9b) than that of pure α-MnO2 in the first 30th cycles for LOB was observed (Fig. S9a). For SOB, a radial expansion of 245% (diameter from 49 to 91 nm) was observed during the discharge process ( Fig. 2h-k and III, and Supplementary Movie S5). The formation of Na0.5MnO2 confirms that Na+ intercalated into the α-MnO2 channels and led to the volume expansion (Fig. S10a-d). Moreover, a sparsely distributed pearl-like product was formed on the surface of the nanowire cathode at deep discharge (Fig. 2j, k and III), which is different from uniform coating layer in the LOB. The SAED and EELS indicate that the bubble-like layer was NaO2 and Na2O2 ( Fig. S10a-d). Note that the Li2O2 layer on the nanowire surface was uniform, while the NaO2/Na2O2 on the surface of the nanowire was sparsely distributed, where some locations were very thick, while other areas were almost clean. The scattered growth of the discharge product on Au@α-MnO2 cathode in SOB was ascribed to the larger ionic radius of Na+ than Li+ (0.59 Å for Li+, 0.97 Å for Na+ and 1.33 Å for K+) therefore non-uniform diffusion of Na+ [49]. We speculated that Na+ ions were inserted in the α-MnO2 channels and caused large amounts of defects during the discharge process in SOB. The radius of Na+ ions is larger than that of Li+ ions, so the migration of Na+ ion is slower, causing local accumulation of a large number of Na+ ions that cannot easily diffuse to the surface of α-MnO2 nanowire. It was observed that Au on the surface of the nanowire did not react with Na+ ions (Fig. S10b-d), so the accumulated Na+ ions were not consumed, which then reacted with O2 to form NaO2 that quickly disproportionated into Na2O2 and O2, leading to the formation of pearl-like oxide [25]. The scattered distribution of the oxides implies that the Na+ ions are transported from the inner channels to the surface of the nanowires rather than from the surface. If Na+ was transported along the surface, the oxide layer should be evenly covered on the nanowire surface. Control experiments of Na-Au@α-MnO2 nanobattery under vacuum was also conducted. A higher volume expansion (about 137%) without cracking occurred on the α-MnO2 nanowire (Fig. S11a-d and Supplementary Movie S6) indicating that the Na+ ions accumulation did not cause structure damage of α-MnO2 nanowire. However, it is expected that continuous reaction with O2 would happen in SOB, so enough local concentration gradient is needed to drive the Na+ diffusion to the surface of the nanowire and to react with O2. To further elucidate the reaction mechanism of the SOB, control experiments of Na-bare α-MnO2 nanobattery under the O2 ambient were performed (Fig. S12a-e and Supplementary Movie S7). The Na+ ions intercalated into the channel structure of α-MnO2, causing radial expansion, afterwards Na+ ions were transported to the surface and reacted with O2, leading to the formation of voids (marked by yellow dotted circles) inside the electrode. When the bias was reversed, except for the aggregation of Au particles, the morphology and structure were almost unchanged during the charging process (Fig. 2l-n and IV). SAED and EELS confirm that the NaO2 and Na2O2 did not decompose during charge (Fig. S10e-h), suggesting that the Au particles exhibited poor catalytic activity on the decomposition of NaO2/Na2O2 possibly due to the sodium oxides coating on the surface of the nanowire which insulated the discharge products from the active materials [25]. In addition, this incomplete decomposition is attributed to the poor ionic conductivity of Na2O2, which is four orders of magnitude lower (10-13 S cm−1 at room temperature) [50] than that of Li2O2 (10-9 S cm−1 at room temperature) [51]. The poor ionic conductivity severely hinders the transport kinetics of Na+ ions. Therefore, the poor ionic conductivity is the primary reason why NaO2/Na2O2 cannot be fully decomposed during the charging process. It means that the severe polarization would be observed in the coin-type cell of SOB using Au@α-MnO2 as cathode than that LOB. As showed Fig. S13, a similar phenomenon of LIB was observed that the Au-coated reduced the polarization for SOB in the first 10th cycles. Similar to SOB, scattered bulges were produced on the surface of the nanowire during the discharge process of POB (Fig. 2o-r, V and Supplementary Movie S8). We suspected that the inserted K+ ions introduced defects in α-MnO2, because K+ ions have large ion radius, rendering them difficult to be extracted to the surface of α-MnO2, causing the K+ ions accumulation in the channels in α-MnO2. With the continuous accumulation of K+ ions, the internal tunnel structure of the nanowire might be broken due to the large internal stress. The released K+ ions from the broken α-MnO2 reacted with O2 to form KO2 and K2O2 (Figs. 2V and S14a-d). In comparison, the potassiation of Au@α-MnO2 under vacuum (Fig. S15a-d and Supplementary Movie S9) caused the explosion of α-MnO2 nanowire (marked by white arrow), further indicating that the insertion of K+ ions led to the brokage of the nanowire. Therefore, during the discharge of the POB, the accumulated K+ ions only reacted with O2 when the α-MnO2 nanowire was destroyed by the large internal stress to transport K+ to the nanowire surface. To understand the role of Au on the electrochemistry of POB, the discharge process of bare α-MnO2 under O2 ambient (Fig. S16a-e and Supplementary Movie S10) was investigated. It showed that cracking occurred in the initial discharge process (marked by a white arrow) [30]. It is ascribed to the sluggish K+ transport caused by the large ionic radius of K+ in the channel structure, leading to its accumulation at defect locations, which induced local stress and caused damage to the nanowire. When the bias was reversed, the overall morphology and structure were almost unchanged during the charging process (Fig. 2s-u and VI). SAED and EELS confirm that the KO2 and K2O2 did not decompose (Fig. S14e-h) during charge, indicating that the Au particles had no catalytic activity on the decomposition of KO2/K2O2. Therefore, α-MnO2 based POB could not be continuously recycled, which is similar to SOB. While Au only improved the cycling performance for POB with no obvious change of polarization in coin-type POB batteries, as shown Fig. S17. According to the in-situ TEM results, the intercalation process of cations (Li+, Na+ and K+) into α-MnO2 is similar to that of MIBs. The ionic transport mechanism during the intercalation reaction dominantly affects the subsequent MORBs. Therefore, how the cations transported from the channel structure to the surface react with O2 and form peroxides and superoxide under the MORBs was investigated. We assembled coin-type Li/α-MnO2, Na/α-MnO2, K/α-MnO2 half-cells and performed STEM-HAADF imaging of the discharged α-MnO2 based electrode material (Fig. 3). The cutoff voltage of the first discharge was set to 0.6 V (Fig. S18) to control the state of charge of the α-MnO2 electrode. To observe the internal structure of α-MnO2 more clearly, we prepared TEM samples by microtome technique. The detailed sample preparation is given in the experiment section. The STEM-HAADF images of the cross-section of the pristine α-MnO2 (Fig. 3a and b) show a regular channel structure composed of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 channels. No signal of K+ occupation in the center of the 2 × 2 channels was observed [26]. The absence of K+ in the tunnel centers provides the opportunity to investigate the net effect of Li+/Na+/K+ insertion in the atomic channels on the performance of MORBs without the interference of pre-existed K+. STEM-HAADF images show that a lot of defects, such as linear defects and voids, were formed after cation ion insertion into α-MnO2 (Fig. 3d, g, j and Figs. S19-21). We speculated that the cation intercalation induced defects were ascribed to the dissolution of Mn [52–56]. For the LIB (Fig. S19) and sodium ion battery (SIB) (Fig. S20), a number of 2 × 5 channels were formed via the breakage of edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra and migration of Mn to the interstitial site of the adjacent 1 × 1 channels. For the potassium ion battery (PIB), 2 × 4 channels were formed after inserting of K+ ions (Fig. S21). And the larger 2 × 5 or 2 × 4 channels neatly arrayed a line defect, which provided the larger ion transport channels for Li+/Na+/K+ along the longitudinal direction. Compared to pristine α-MnO2, the Li-inserted ones have larger lattice distortions, while the distortion caused by Na/K-insertion is relatively small. Schematic diagrams of each channel structure are illustrated in Fig. 3(c, f, i and l). These results indicate that the alkali metal ions transported through the internal channels in α-MnO2, causing the formation of various defects. We also observed large channel structures at the edges of the cross-section of α-MnO2 and these channels were opened along the < 110 > direction for the LIB (Fig. 3e) and SIB (Fig. 3h). The opening of the channel might be caused by the local accumulation of Li+ or Na+, leading to the instability of the local structure. These results imply that Li+ and Na+ in α-MnO2 can transport from the internal channels to the surface, and then reacted with O2 in LOB and SOB. As we speculated, the radius of Li+ is relatively small, and it is easy to transport to the surface to react with O2, so a uniform oxide layer was formed (Fig. 2d and I). However, due to the relatively large radius of Na+ ions, only when the local concentration of Na+ ions reached a threshold, which broke the channel structure so that Na+ can transport to the surface to react with O2. Therefore, only the locations in α-MnO2 where Na+ ions were accumulated locally can react with O2, so the formed oxide layer was sparsely distributed (Fig. 2k and III). However, for PIB (Fig. 3k), only a few large channel structures were present at the edge and they were not opened in any direction. Therefore K+ cannot transport from the channels to the surface. As such, to perform the POB, K+ must be continuously accumulated. Only when the α-MnO2 channel is broken by K+ accumulation induced local internal stress, K+ can be released. As we observed in Fig. 2(r and V), the scattered bulge-shaped oxide was formed on the surface of nanowire during the discharge process in POB. In order to understand the differences in the transport of alkali metal ions in the α-MnO2 channels, AIMD simulations were carried out with eight alkali metal ions placed randomly in one of the 1 × 1 × 5 cells (a × b × c), as shown in Figs. S22-25 . We clearly observe that Li+ is transported through the 8 h site (Fig. S23); Na+ can be transported through the 2a and 8 h sites with a large volume expansion (Fig. S24); K+ can only be transported through the 2a site (Fig. S25) and will break the channel structure leading to a disruption of the channel structure (Fig. 2o-r and V). Combining the above observations and discussions, we propose an ion-pump reaction mechanism of the energy storage and conversion mechanism of MORBs. The schematic diagram of in-situ MOB nanobattery is shown in Fig. 4(a). Alkali metals, in-situ formed alkali metal oxide layers and Au@α-MnO2 nanowire were used as the anodes, electrolytes and O2 cathodes for the MOB nanobattery. α-MnO2 was mainly used to transport alkali metal ions, which function as an MIB. During discharge, the alkali metal ions (Li+/Na+/K+) intercalated into the channels of the nanowire, and then were pumped to the surface to react with O2 to form alkali metal oxides. For all three alkali metal ions, defects occurred in the channel after insertion of metal ions into α-MnO2 channel. However, the mode of transport from the inner channel to the surface was determined by the radius of cations. For LOB, the radius of Li+ ion is relatively small, and it was easy to transport to the surface to react with O2 controlled by the alloyed reaction to produce a uniform oxide layer. Even if Li+ accumulated at the defects, it should also cause instability of local channel structure, making local channels to open so that Li+ could react with O2 (Fig. 4c and d). The radius of Na+ ions is larger than that of Li+ ions, so the migration of Na+ ion was slower, causing local accumulation of Na+ ions which could not easily transport to the surface of the nanowire. With continuous Na+ accumulation, the induced concentration gradient caused the local channel structure to collapse, and then Na+ transported to the surface of the nanowire to react with O2 to produce sparsely distributed pearl-like oxides (Fig. 4e and f). Therefore, it was a reaction controlled by concentration gradient in SOB. Although the insertion of large K+ into the electrode material also caused the defects, the large local internal stress generated by the accumulated K+ ions at the defects destroyed the surface structure before opening the channel, resulting in the formation of an uneven oxide layer (KO2 and K2O2) on the surface of the electrode material (Fig. 4g and h), therefore, it is a reaction controlled by internal stress in POB. 4 Conclusions Li+/Na+/K+ transport mechanism in the α-MnO2 atomic channels was revealed at atomic scale. Ion radii played a decisive role in the ion transport and electrochemistry. More detailed conclusions are the following. (1) Li+ ions have the fastest transport kinetics due to their small radius (0.59 Å). Li+ ions cannot only transport along the [001] direction of α-MnO2, but also diffuse along the < 110 > directions rapidly. Thus Li+ ions are rapidly transported via the internal 2 × 2 channels to the nanowire surface, reacting with O2 to form a uniform Li2O2 layer on the nanowire surface in the LOBs. (2) Na+ ions can also transport along the [100] direction then deflect to the radial direction of the nanowire but with slower kinetics than Li+ ions. Consequently, Na+ ions may be clogged locally in the nanowire, causing the formation of sparsely distributed NaO2/Na2O2 in the SOBs. (3) K+ ions can only transport along the [001] direction but not the radial directions of the nanowire due to its large radius. Moreover, the intercalation of large K+ ions into α-MnO2 induced large stress, causing cracks and fractures in the nanowires. As such, only scattered bulge-like KO2/K2O2 was formed on the nanowire surface. (4) Au coating on the nanowire speeds up the reaction kinetics of MIBs and MOBs, thus mitigating fracture of the nanowires. These results reveal the atomic scale ion transport mechanism of alkali metal ions, which may be harnessed to improve the performance of MIBs and MOBs. For example, by coating Au to the α-MnO2 surface, the alkali metal ions are pumped from the nanowire interior to the surface rapidly, thus mitigating stress accumulation and fracture of the nanowires.

        "dc:description": "Understanding alkali metal ions' (e.g., Li+/Na+/K+) transport mechanism is challenging but critical to improving the performance of alkali metal batteries. Herein using α-MnO2 nanowires as cathodes, the transport kinetics of Li+/Na+/K+ in the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2 with a growth direction of [001] is revealed. We show that ion radius plays a decisive role in determining the ion transport and electrochemistry. Regardless of the ion radii, Li+/Na+/K+ can all go through the 2 × 2 channels of α-MnO2, generating large stress and causing channel merging or opening. However, smaller ions such as Li+ and Na+ cannot only transport along the [001] direction but also migrate along the < 110 > direction to the nanowire surface; for large ion such as K+, diffusion along the < 110 > direction is prohibited. The different ion transport behavior has grand consequences in the electrochemistry of metal oxygen batteries (MOBs). For Li-O2 battery, Li+ transports uniformly to the nanowire surface, forming a uniform layer of oxide; Na+ also transports to the nanowire surface but may be clogged locally due to its larger radius, therefore sporadic pearl-like oxides form on the nanowire surface; K+ cannot transport to the nanowire surface due to its large radius, instead, it breaks the nanowire locally, causing local deposition of potassium oxides. The study provides atomic scale understanding of the alkali metal ion transport mechanism which may be harnessed to improve the performance of MOBs.",
