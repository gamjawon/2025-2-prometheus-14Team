(S. Shen). The electronic configuration of central metal atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs) is pivotal in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, chalcogen heteroatoms (e.g., S, Se, and Te) were incorporated into the symmetric nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N4-C) configuration to obtain Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs with asymmetric coordination presented for central Ni atoms. Among these obtained Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, Ni-Se-N3-C exhibited superior eCO2RR activity, with CO selectivity reaching ~98% at −0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The Zn-CO2 battery integrated with Ni-Se-N3-C as cathode and Zn foil as anode achieved a peak power density of 1.82 mW cm–2 and maintained remarkable rechargeable stability over 20 h. In-situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the chalcogen heteroatoms doped into the Ni-N4-C configuration would break coordination symmetry and trigger charge redistribution, and then regulate the intermediate behaviors and thermodynamic reaction pathways for eCO2RR. Especially, for Ni-Se-N3-C, the introduced Se atoms could significantly raise the d-band center of central Ni atoms and thus remarkably lower the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *COOH formation, contributing to the promising eCO2RR performance for high selectivity CO production by competing with hydrogen evolution reaction. Graphical Abstract Chalcogen heteroatoms were incorporated into the symmetric nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N4-C) configuration to obtain Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs with asymmetric coordination for highly efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO. A peak power density of 1.82 mW cm–2 was achieved in a Zn-CO2 battery integrated by using Ni-Se-N3-C as the cathode and Zn foil as the anode. Keywords Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction Chalcogen heteroatoms Single-atom catalysts Asymmetric coordination CO production 1. Introduction Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) driven by renewable energy generated electricity has emerged as a critical technology that could realize carbon neutrality by converting industry-emitted CO2 into value-added carbon-contained fuels and chemicals, e.g., CO, hydrocarbon, and oxygenated hydrocarbon [1–4]. Given the considerable value in the C1 chemical product chain, CO has been believed to be close to commercialization [2,5,6], when produced from the two-electron involved eCO2RR with high activity and high selectivity as expected. Significant efforts have been devoted to eCO2RR to CO, with advances achieved over various electrocatalysts, e.g., metal-based alloys, oxides, and chalcogenides [7,8]. Recently, to pursue the sufficient atomic utilization of metals active for eCO2RR, single-atom catalysts (SACs), particularly those comprised of noble or non-noble metals atomically dispersed at nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) substrates, have attracted extensive attentions for their superior catalytic performance and atomic efficiency. Although noble metal SACs, such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag), exhibited high CO selectivity, their high cost and scarcity have limited the practical applications [9,10]. In contrast, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon SACs (M-N-C) (M: Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, etc.), offered a promising alternative to noble metal SACs for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion, due to the low price and earth abundance [11–15]. For example, a series of M-N-C (M: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) SACs were developed for eCO2RR with performances highly dependent on the metal centers [16]. It was discovered that Ni-N-C and Fe-N-C SACs with energy barriers reduced for the formation of *COOH intermediates exhibited much improved performances for eCO2RR as compared to other M-N-C SACs. Theoretical calculations and experimental observations further revealed that the binding energy between M-N moieties and rate-controlling intermediates was the determinant to reaction pathways and then the activity and selectivity for eCO2RR. In these developed M-N-C SACs, the four-nitrogen coordinated metal (M-N4) configurations with saturated and symmetric structures have been evidenced as the active sites for CO2 reduction. Especially, the Ni-N4 configuration has been well documented for their electrocatalytic activity and selectivity superior to other M-N4 configurations for CO production, referring to Ni-N4-C SACs as the promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR [6,17]. However, the electrocatalytic activity is still unsatisfying for these M-N4 configurations, given their geometric and electronic symmetry responsible for the high energy barrier for electrocatalysis. It could be thus expected that the strategic coordination of heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus, etc.) with central metal atoms in the symmetric structures would alter the atomic coordination and then the electronic configuration of the central metal atoms, to improve the electrocatalytic activity [17–22]. In this regard, by introducing a second heteroatom in M-N x -C SACs, the charge distribution and the coordination environment around the central metal atoms could be well engineered, possibly contributing to the significant improvement in eCO2RR performances. For instance, with S atoms introduced into Ni-N2-C SACs, the formed Ni-N2-S configuration with asymmetric coordination environment could transform the rate-determining step (RDS) from the *CO desorption to the *COOH formation, and greatly reduce the RDS energy barrier, giving rise to the enhanced activity and selectivity for CO production at low overpotentials [19]. Li et al. [20] found that introducing P atoms into Fe-N4-C SACs could increase the electron density of central Fe atoms, which in turn significantly boosted the formation of *COOH intermediates, leading to the superior eCO2RR performance. These above examples suggest that the introduction of heteroatoms into the symmetric M-N x -C configurations could engineer the coordination environments and then decrease the RDS energy barrier for the accelerated eCO2RR. As inspired by the above advances of heteroatoms doped SACs for eCO2RR, herein, chalcogen group elements (e.g., S, Se, and Te) were doped into the symmetric Ni-N4-C configurations to obtain Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs with asymmetric coordination and electronic structures by gas-phase sulfidation, selenization, tellurization using S, Se, Te powder as the heteroatom resource, respectively. Among these obtained Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se and Te) SACs, Ni-Se-N3-C demonstrates superior electrochemical eCO2RR performance for selective CO production, with Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaching as high as ~98% at −0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, the Zn-CO2 battery integrated with Ni-Se-N3-C as cathode and Zn foil as anode exhibits the practical feasibility and application of CO2 conversion and electric energy output, with a peak power density of 1.82 mW cm–2 achieved during the discharge process and a remarkable rechargeable stability retained over 20 h operation. In-situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms (S, Se, and Te) into the Ni-N4-C configuration would break coordination symmetry and trigger charge redistribution around central Ni atoms, regulating the intermediate behaviors and thermodynamic reaction pathways for eCO2RR. Notably, with Se atoms introduced into the Ni-N4-C configuration, the obtained Ni-Se-N3-C SAC presents much raised d-band center of central Ni atoms, significantly lowering the RDS energy barrier for *COOH formation, and thus the encouraging improvement in eCO2RR performance for high selectivity CO production. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals Zinc (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-methylimidazole (2-MI, Macklin), methanol (Aladdin), isopropanol (Macklin), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Company), sulfur powder (S, 99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Company), selenium powder (Se, 99.9%, Macklin), tellurium powder (Te, 99.9%, Aladdin), carbon paper (TGP-H-060), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 97%, Shanghai Chemical Reagents), Nafion solution (5 wt%, DuPont520), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (HCl, Sinopharm Chemical Company). 2.2. Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1. Synthesis of ZIF-8 1.84 g of 2-MI was dissolved in 21 mL of methanol. Then, 42 mL of methanol dissolved with 1.67 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was injected into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 1 h at room temperature. The obtained solution was transferred into a 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 4 h. The obtained ZIF-8 product was separated by centrifugation, and washed with methanol three times, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. 2.2.2. Synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) The as-prepared ZIF-8 precursors were calcined at 1100 °C in a tube furnace under Ar flow for 1 h at a ramping rate of 5 °C min–1 to obtain nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C). 2.2.3. Synthesis of chalcogen heteroatoms-doped N-C (X-N-C (X: S, Se, and Te)) 1.0 g of sulfur (S), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te) powder was put upstream, and 100 mg of the as-prepared N-C precursor was put downstream in the tube furnace. Then, the tube furnace was heated to 600 °C under Ar flow for 2 h at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain chalcogen heteroatoms-doped N-C, noted as X-N-C (X: S, Se, and Te). 2.2.4. Synthesis of chalcogen heteroatoms doped nickel-nitrogen-carbon single-atom catalysts (Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs) Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs were prepared via an impregnation-pyrolysis-acid leaching method. Typically, Taking Ni-S-N3-C as an example, 50 mg of X-N-C (X: S, Se, and Te) was dispersed in 8 mL of isopropanol containing 0.015 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O, which was then ultrasonicated for 2 h and stirred for 2 h. After being collected by centrifugation (11000 r min−1) for 10 min and then dried at 60 °C overnight in vacuum, the obtained powder was ground and subjected to pyrolysis at 700 °C for 1 h under Ar atmosphere, which was then leached in 3 mol L−1 HCl for 24 h to remove metal particles and unstable species. The acid-leached powder was collected and washed with deionized water until its pH value was close to neutral, and then dried at 60 °C overnight in vacuum to obtain the final Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs. 2.3. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) in H-type cell All eCO2RR measurements were performed on a CHI 760E Potentiostat at ambient temperature and pressure in a three-electrode H-type cell. Catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 2 mg of Ni-N4-C, and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs in a mixture of Nafion solution (10 μL, 5 wt%, DuPont) and ethanol (500 µL), followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. The working electrode for eCO2RR was prepared by dropping catalytic ink (60 μL) on a carbon paper (0.5 × 0.5 cm2), which was separated from the counter electrode by a Nafion membrane to hinder the re-oxidation of the products on the counter electrode in the H-shaped electrochemical cell. A platinum foil was used as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was used as the reference electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out in both CO2 and N2-saturated electrolytes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were collected between the frequency of 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in non-Faradic region at various scan rates of 5−45 mV s−1 to calculate the double layer capacitances (C dl), C dl = ((J a − J c)/2)/ν, where J a and J c are the positive and negative scan currents at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively; ν is the scan rate. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were calculated by ECSA = C dl/C s (C s is assumed as 40 µF cm−2). All potentials were calculated with respect to the RHE scale according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.197 − IR, at 25 °C), where ERHE is the potential versus RHE, E Ag/AgCl is the potential versus Ag/AgCl, I is the current, and R is the solution resistance. The turnover frequency (TOF) of CO generated at Ni-N4-C, and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs was calculated by the following Eq. (1). (1) TOF = I C O / n F m catalysts × w / M × 3600 where, ICO: partial current for CO production, A; n: number of electrons transferred; F: Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); m catalysts: loading mass of catalysts on the working electrode, g; w: weight contents (wt%) of Ni in Ni-N4-C and Ni-X-N3-C; and M: the atomic weight of the Ni, g mol−1. A CO2-saturated 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3 solution was used as both the cathode and anode electrolytes, and a flow of CO2 (10 mL min−1) was maintained through the cathodic electrolyte during the electrochemical measurements. The gas products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC 8860) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) for CO quantification and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2 quantification. The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of CO and H2 were calculated based on the Eq. (2). (2) FE = Q i Q = v f x n P F I R T × 100 % where, v: volumetric flow rate, fx : volume concentration of CO or H2 in the gas flow delivered into the gas chromatograph at a given sampling time, n: number of electrons transferred, P: ambient pressure (1.01 × 105 Pa), F: Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), I: current at the given sampling time, R: gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T: room temperature (23 °C). 2.4. Fabrication and measurements of Zn-CO2 batteries The rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery test was performed in a home-made double-electrolyte electrochemical cell separated by a bipolar membrane, in which Ni-Se-N3-C SAC was coated on the hydrophobic carbon paper (with a geometric area of 0.5 cm2) as the cathode and the Zn plate (with a geometric area of 0.5 cm2) was used as the anode. 2.0 mg of catalyst and 10 μL of 5 wt% Nafion were dispersed in 500 μL of ethanol, followed by ultrasonication for 30 min to obtain the catalyst ink. 125 μL of catalyst ink was deposited on the carbon paper with an average loading amount of 1 mg cm−2. A mixture of 2 mol L−1 KOH and 0.02 mol L−1 Zn(CH3COO)2 was used as anodic electrolyte, and the cathodic electrolyte is 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3. The flow rate of CO2 was controlled at a rate of 20 mL min−1. 2.5. In-situ Raman measurements In-situ Raman spectra were in homemade three-electrode H-type Raman cell by a LabRAM Soleil Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA) with a 532 nm laser, at applied potentials from 0 to −0.9 V versus RHE. The H-type Raman cell was assembled with the catalysts loaded working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated KCl), a carbon rode counter electrode, an anion exchange membrane (FAA-3-PK-130), and a flowing CO2-saturated 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3 electrolyte. 2.6. X-ray adsorption spectra (XAS) measurements X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Ni K-edge (8333 eV) were carried out at BL20A at the Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan, China. The acquired extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages. The Ni k 3-weighted χ(k) data in the k-space ranging from 3.00−14.40 Å−1 were Fourier transformed to real (R) space using a Hanning windows (dk = 1.0 Å−1) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the detailed structural parameters around Ni atom in the as-prepared samples, quantitative curve-fittings were carried out for the Fourier transformed k 3 χ(k) in the R-space using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT. Effective backscattering amplitudes F(k) and phase shifts Φ(k) of all fitting paths were calculated by the ab initio code FEFF8.04. During the fitting analysis, the amplitude reduction factor S02 was fixed to the best-fit value of 0.654, which was determined from fitting the reference sample of Ni foil. To fit the data of Ni-N4-C and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, the Ni-N and Ni-X (X: S, Se, and Te) coordination number (CN), inner potential shift (ΔE 0), interatomic distance (ΔR) and Debye-Waller factor (σ 2) were allowed to vary. The obtained structural parameters are summarized in Table S2. 2.7. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [23–25]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was employed for the electronic exchange and correlation [26]. The plane wave pseudopotential method with a kinetic cutoff energy of 450 eV was employed. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack setup with a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh. The convergence criterion for the self-consistent total energy was set to less than 10–5 eV per atom, and the atoms positions were optimized until the Hellman-Feynman force on each atom was smaller than 0.05 eV Å–1 [27,28]. To prevent interactions between the surface and its periodic images, a vacuum region of least 15 Å was included in the calculations. The DFT-D3 correction, proposed by Grimme et al. [29,30], was applied to account for dispersion effects in adsorption processes. Additionally, to correct for self-interaction errors in exchange correlation functional, the Hubbard U model was employed to accurately describe the strong correlation of the localized Ni 3d states. The value of U eff, defined as (U – J), was set to 6.40 eV [31]. The Gibbs free energy difference (ΔG) for eCO2RR and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was calculated according to the approach proposed by Nørskov et al. This can be expressed by Eq. (3): (3) ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔEZPE – TΔS where ΔEDFT, ΔEZPE, and ΔS denote the DFT-calculated electronic energy difference between reactants and products of reactions, the zero-point energy correction, and the vibrational entropy at 23 °C, respectively. The ideal gas approximation was used for CO2, CO, and H2, and the harmonic approximation was used for adsorbates. 3. Results and discussion To engineer the coordination environments of central metal atoms in SACs with N-C substrate, herein, chalcogen heteroatoms (e.g., S, Se, and Te) were firstly doped into N-C, obtained by carbonizing precursory ZIF-8 with rhombic dodecahedron well maintained (Fig. S1), via gas-phase sulfidation, selenization, tellurization, using S, Se, Te powder as the heteroatom resource, respectively. The prepared X-N-C were then anchored with Ni single atoms to obtain the asymmetrically coordinated Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs through an impregnation-pyrolysis-acid leaching process (Fig. 1(a) , and see details in the Experimental section). It is easily observed that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms and the anchoring of Ni single atoms would hardly change the structural property of pristine N-C obtained from ZIF-8 by high-temperature carbonization, with morphology retained in rhombic dodecahedron (Fig. S2). With no nanoparticles or clusters detected in TEM images (Figs. 1(b)−(b)) and identified in XRD patterns (Fig. S3), the homogeneous distribution of Ni single atoms and chalcogen heteroatoms in these SACs could be confirmed by elemental mappings (Figs. S4−S7). More evidently, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images discover the homogeneously distributed bright dots, corresponding to the isolated and evenly distributed Ni single atoms in both Ni-N4-C (Fig. 1(f)) and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) (Figs. 1(g)−(g)). As determined from the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) analysis (Table S1), the Ni contents are obviously increased in Ni-X-N3-C (X; S, Se, and Te) SACs (0.45 wt%−0.50 wt%) relative to Ni-N4-C (0.40 wt%), due to the doped chalcogen heteroatoms and along with the introduced defects in N-C substrates (Fig. S8), serving as the anchoring sites stabilizing Ni single atoms [32–34]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were employed to elucidate the elemental compositions and chemical states in Ni-N4-C and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs. One could note the two Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 peaks at ~855.5 and ~873.2 eV in Ni-N4-C (Fig. 2(a) ), respectively, indicating that the central Ni atoms exist in the oxidation state rather than the metallic state [35]. In comparison, with chalcogen heteroatoms introduced into the N-C substrates, the Ni 2p signals are gradually shifted to lower binding energies for Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te), depending on the decreasing electronegativity of coordination atoms in the order of N > S > Se > Te. These observations demonstrate the significant change in coordination environments at the central Ni atoms as induced by the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms, with electron transfer from central Ni atoms and chalcogen heteroatoms to N atoms. High-resolution XPS N 1s spectra present the pyridinic N (~397.4 eV), pyrrolic N (~399.7 eV), graphitic N (~401.1 eV), and oxidized N (~404.5 eV) species in the pristine N-C substrate (Fig. S9). Notably, an additional peak at ~398.2 eV could be detected in for both Ni-N4-C (Fig. S10) and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) (Figs. S11(a), (c), and (e)), assigned to the Ni-N coordination. The very similar chemical compositions of different N species in Ni-N4-C and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, Te) SACs (Fig. S12) should have negligible effects on their different eCO2RR performances. Such coordination environments would be altered by the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms. For instance, with S introduced into Ni-N4-C, except for the three peaks located at ~163.9, ~165.4, and ~167.5 eV in the S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. S11(b)), attributed to the S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 signals of C-S-C, and the signal of oxidized S species, respectively, one additional peak at ~162.7 eV could be observed, which should be related to the metal-S bond, i.e., the Ni-S bond in Ni-S-N3-C [2,36]. Similarly, as determined from the XPS Se 3d (Fig. S11(d)) and Te 3d (Fig. S11(f)) spectra, the Ni-Se and Ni-Te bonds are formed in Ni-Se-N3-C and Ni-Te-N3-C, respectively [37,38]. These XPS analytic results corroborate the successful introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms into Ni-N4-C, with the coordination environments at the central Ni atoms well modulated for the obtained Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs. To gain further insights into the atomic coordination and chemical environments of Ni single atoms in the Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, XAS measurements were carried out, with XANES and Fourier transform-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra collected at Ni K-edge. It is easily noted that Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs exhibit XANES absorption edges very similar to NiO as reference (Fig. 2(b)), suggesting that the average oxidation state of central Ni atoms in Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) should be close to +2, consistent with the XPS results [39]. In comparison to nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) with typical Ni-N4-C configuration, all Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs present very different spectral profiles, indicating the significant change in coordination environments induced by the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms. In comparison to the very weak pre-edge feature for NiPc (Fig. 2(b), inset), expected from its typical square planar Ni-N4 structure (D4h) centro-symmetry [19,40], the much increase in the pre-edge peak intensity observed for Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs should be attributed to the non-centrosymmetric structures with chalcogen heteroatoms introduced [19,41]. Specifically, the large and distinct pre-edge features (Fig. 2(b), inset) signify the local electric quadrupole transitions (1s to 3d transition) and the local electric dipole transition (1s to 4p transition), signifying the 3d and 4p orbital hybridization of Ni central atoms in Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs [41]. As further revealed in FT-EXAFS spectra, with characteristic peak of Ni-Ni bonds (~2.2 Å) hardly observed, the dominated peaks at ~1.5 Å associated with the first coordination shell of Ni-N scattering path could be noted for Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs and NiPc as reference (Fig. 2(c)). With chalcogen heteroatoms introduced, an additional small peak appears at ~2.0 Å for Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te), implying the formation of Ni−S, Ni−Se, and Ni−Te bonds with distance larger than the Ni−N bond [40]. These results verify the single-atom Ni sites in Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) with coordination environments altered by the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms. The single-atom dispersion of Ni sites could also be evidenced by the wavelet transformation (WT) analyses of Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 2(d) and Figs. S13, 14), with maximum intensity observed at ~5.0 Å−1 attributed to the Ni-N coordination. The absence of Ni-Ni characteristic peak located at ~8.0 Å−1 could then exclude the presence of metallic Ni clusters and nanoparticles. By further fitting the FT-EXAFS results (Figs. 2(e)–(g) and Table S2), it is deduced that the central Ni atoms are square planar coordinated by three neighboring N atoms and one heteroatom (X: S, Se, and Te), which validates the asymmetric coordination geometry in these obtained Ni-X-N3-C SACs. The eCO2RR performances of obtained SACs were evaluated with an H-type cell in CO2-saturated 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3 electrolyte. LSV measurements (Fig. S15) reveal the positively shifted onset potentials and much increased current densities in CO2-saturated as compared to N2-saturated electrolytes for all the SACs, suggesting the efficient eCO2RR competitive to HER and even dominating in the Faradic processes. It could be noted that with chalcogen heteroatoms introduced, all the Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs demonstrate higher current densities than the pristine Ni-N4-C, with the largest current response yielded over Ni-Se-N3-C in CO2-saturated electrolyte (Fig. S16). Such significant increase in eCO2RR performance should be related to the promoted charge transfer processes at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, as evidenced by the EIS analysis (Fig. S17). Given the charge transfer resistance (R ct) decreased from 1.68 Ω cm−2 for Ni-N4-C to 1.15 Ω cm−2 for Ni-S-N3-C, 0.78 Ω cm−2 for Ni-Se-N3-C, and 1.05 Ω cm−2 for Ni-Te-N3-C, it is believed that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms, especially Se, would provide a coordination environment favoring interfacial charge transfer and then eCO2RR. To assess the competitive dynamics between eCO2RR and HER, the selectivity for CO production was determined by the FEs of CO and H2 as the only two products detected during the electrochemical reactions. Corresponding well to LSV results, one would note the highest CO FEs obtained over Ni-Se-N3-C among all the SACs, with CO selectivity reaching as high as ~98% at −0.70 V versus RHE (Fig. 3(a) ). Along with the greatly inhibited HER as suggested by the lowest selectivity for H2 production (Fig. S18), the introduced Se heteroatoms would endow the Ni-Se-N3-C SAC with electrochemical superiority for eCO2RR, as also affirmed by the CO partial current density (Fig. 3(b)). The CO partial current density is significantly elevated for Ni-Se-N3-C, reaching 53.9 mA cm−2 at −0.85 V vs. RHE, as compared to Ni-S-N3-C (31.2 mA cm−2), Ni-Te-N3-C SACs (14.5 mA cm−2), and Ni-N4-C (24.9 mA cm−2). The 10 h long-term eCO2RR measurement conducted on Ni-Se-N3-C at −0.7 V versus RHE confirms its good stability for eCO2RR (Fig. S19). By determining the applied potentials dependent turnover frequencies (TOFs) associated with various coordination structures for CO production, normalized to the Ni contents (Fig. 3(c)), Ni-Se-N3-C SAC again claims its superior activity for CO2-to-CO conversion, with TOFs much higher than Ni-N4-C, Ni-S-N3-C and Ni-Te-N3-C across the measured potentials. As evaluated from the CV curves collected at different scan rates (Figs. S20(a)–(c)), the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were estimated to be 15.9, 47.9, and 24.5 cm2 for Ni-S-N3-C, Ni-Se-N3-C, and Ni-Te-N3-C (Fig. S20(d)), respectively. The much increased ECSA for Ni-Se-N3-C reveals the abundant active sites for eCO2RR, which well supports its superior eCO2RR performance. These electrochemical findings collectively elucidate the exceptional eCO2RR performance of Ni-Se-N3-C with asymmetric coordination for selective CO production. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms for eCO2RR over the above chalcogen heteroatoms doped asymmetric configurations, in-situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the behaviors of reaction intermediates generated on the Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs. With applied potentials cathodically shifted from 0 V to −0.9 V versus RHE, five Raman bands could be observed for the Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs. Specifically, the Raman band located at ~1060 cm−1 (Fig. S21(a), (c), and (e)) is assigned to the stretching vibration of chemisorbed carbonate, v(CO3 2−), which should be arisen from the deprotonation of HCO3 − (HCO3 – → H+ + CO3 2−) [42]. It is thus proposed that HCO3 – acts as the proton donor, contributing to the formation of H+ and CO3 2− during eCO2RR. The Raman bands observed at 1385 and 1640 cm−1, related to v(C-O) and v(C=O) of *COOH intermediates (Figs. 3(d)–(f)), respectively, imply the generation of *COOH intermediates (CO2(g) + H+ + e− → *COOH, step I in Fig. 3(g)) [43,44], which are believed to serve as the pivotal reaction species for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion. Depending on the increased cathodic applied potentials, both the two bands show intensities gradually strengthened and then weakened, which indicates the formation and subsequent consumption of *COOH intermediates for CO production. A careful comparison reveals that the applied potential required for *COOH generation is less cathodic for Ni-Se-N3-C (–0.3 V vs. RHE) than Ni-S-N3-C (–0.4 V vs. RHE) and Ni-Te-N3-C (–0.4 V vs. RHE), well explaining the improved performance for electrochemical CO2-to-CO reduction over Ni-Se-N3-C. The Raman bands observed at ~1590 cm−1 (Figs. 3(d)−(d)) are attributed to the δ(H-OH) bending mode of H2O molecules (*COOH + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O (l), step II in Fig. 3(g)) [45,46]. It is clear that the band intensities are gradually increased with the increasing applied cathodic potentials, implying the accumulation of H2O molecules during eCO2RR, which then manifests the continuous consumption of *COOH and the generation of *CO. Consequently, the v(C≡O) Raman bands gradually emerged at ~2050 cm−1 (Figs. S21(b), (d), and (f)) suggest the generation of *CO intermediates at the surface (*COOH + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O(l), step II in Fig. 3(g)) [3]. Moreover, the Raman bands related to *CO intermediates are more pronounced over Ni-Se-N3-C than Ni-S-N3-C and Ni-Te-N3-C, which should be responsible to the more efficient CO production over the Ni-Se-N3-C SAC via surface desorption of *CO intermediates (*CO → CO(g)), step III in Fig. 3(g)). Based on the above in-situ spectral investigations, it is reasonably supposed that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms into the Ni-N4-C configuration would alter the intermediate behaviors and then the eCO2RR pathways, by modulating coordination environments and charge distributions at Ni central metals. With slab models optimized for the adsorption of *CO2 on Ni-N4-C (Fig. S22(a)) and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) (Figs. S22(b)−(d)), DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the electronic interaction between the central Ni atoms and the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms. Differential charge density analysis confirms the symmetric electronic structure for Ni-N4-C (Fig. S23(a)) and the asymmetric electronic structure for Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) (Figs. S23(b)−(d)), supporting the charge redistribution induced by the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms. Electrons are transferred from Ni and chalcogen heteroatoms to the neighboring N atoms, given the lower electronegativity of Ni (1.88), S (2.58), Se (2.55), and Te (2.10) than N (3.04), resulting in the asymmetric charge distribution in Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te). Moreover, Bader charge analysis reveals the higher charge density for the Ni-Se moiety (15.09 |e|) than the Ni-S (15.08 |e|) and Ni-Te (14.83 |e|) moieties (Fig. 4(a) ), as supported by the lower electron loss for the Ni-Se moiety (0.91 |e|) than the Ni-S (0.92 |e|) and Ni-Te (1.17 |e|) moieties (Fig. S24 and Table S3). Thus, the Ni-Se moiety with strengthened electron affinity would facilitate the surface adsorption of CO2 molecules, and the increased electron availability at the Ni-Se moieties should facilitate the transfer of electrons to adsorbed CO2, thereby accelerating eCO2RR [36,47−49]. Projected density of states (PDOS) analyses were then conducted to determine the d-band centers of central Ni atoms in Ni-N4-C and Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, based on the optimized configurations of *COOH intermediates adsorbed at the surface of catalysts. Notably, the d-band center (ɛ d) position of central Ni atoms is closer to the Fermi energy (E f) level for Ni-Se-N3-C (−1.82 eV) than Ni-N4-C (−3.96 eV), Ni-S-N3-C (−1.85 eV) and Ni-Te-N3-C (−2.00 eV) (Fig. 4(b)). As the d-band center approaching the Fermi energy level, the adsorption energy of *COOH intermediates is increased, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediates on the surface of catalysts, thereby facilitating eCO2RR kinetics over Ni-Se-N3-C SAC [50,51]. To further unravel the rationales behind the superior activity of Ni-Se-N3-C SAC for eCO2RR, the thermodynamic reaction pathways were studied by DFT calculations, with Gibbs free energy diagram schemed in Fig. 4(c). It is clear that the formation of *COOH intermediates (*CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH) exhibits the largest reaction energy barrier for all the SACs, which is then believed to serve as the rate-determining step (RDS) for eCO2RR. Moreover, the RDS free energy difference (ΔG) is much decreased for the Ni-S-N3-C (0.69 eV), Ni-Se-N3-C (0.51 eV), and Ni-Te-N3-C (0.63 eV) SACs, as compared to the pristine Ni-N4-C (0.72 eV) SAC. Especially, a smallest ΔG could be noted for Ni-Se-N3-C, suggesting its superior activity for CO2-to-CO conversion, which is in good agreement with the PDOS analysis that the introduced Se heteroatoms would benefit the adsorption of *COOH intermediates at surface. One would note that the ΔG for RDS in HER is smaller for Ni-S-N3-C (1.28 eV), Ni-Se-N3-C (1.32 eV), and Ni-Te-N3-C (0.97 eV) SACs than the pristine Ni-N4-C (1.45 eV) SAC (Fig. 4(d)). Thus, the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms is also beneficial to the improved HER activity. Given the competition between HER and eCO2RR, the thermodynamic limit potential differences between eCO2RR and HER (UL(CO2) − UL(H2), ΔG = − neUL (n = 1)) (Fig. 4(e)) were further calculated to explain the various CO production selectivity depending on the introduced chalcogen heteroatoms. Note a more positive (UL(CO2) − UL(H2)) value referring to a higher selectivity for eCO2RR [52,53]. The UL(CO2) − UL(H2) value of Ni-Se-N3-C (0.81 V) is more positive than those of Ni-S-N3-C (0.59 V), Ni-Te-N3-C (0.34 V), and Ni-N4-C (0.73 V), convincing the higher selectivity for eCO2RR to CO on Ni-Se-N3-C. All these DFT calculation results, together with the experimental observations, well illustrate that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms, especially Se, into the symmetric Ni-N4-C configuration would alter the coordination environments and then regulate the intermediate behaviors and thermodynamic reaction pathways for eCO2RR with high CO production selectivity and activity. Given the superior eCO2RR performance of Ni-Se-N3-C, a Zn-CO2 battery consisted of a Zn foil anode and a carbon paper cathode loaded with Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs were assembled to explore its potential in practical application (Fig. 5(a) ). In this Zn-CO2 battery, CO2 is converted to CO at the cathode, and the Zn foil anode is dissolved into a 2 mol L−1 KOH containing 0.02 mol L−1 Zn(CH3COO)2 solution during the discharging process; and during the charging process, Zn2+ ions are reduced back to the Zn anode [18,54], accompanying with oxygen evolution reaction at the cathode. With the rechargeable nature realized by the polarization curves for both charging and discharging processes (Fig. 5(b), Figs. S25(a), S26(a)), the Ni-Se-N3-C cathode powered Zn-CO2 battery achieves the maximum power density of 1.82 mW cm−2 at a current density of ~2 mA cm−2 during the discharge process (Fig. 5(c)), much higher than Ni-S-N3-C (1.65 mW cm−2, Fig. S25(b)) and Ni-Te-N3-C (1.55 mW cm−2, Fig. S26(b)), and even outperforms most of the previously reported Zn-CO2 batteries (Table S4), which thus indicates the superior performance of Ni-Se-N3-C SAC based Zn-CO2 battery for chemical energy to electrical energy conversion. As powered by the Zn-CO2 battery, 71 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) connected in parallel are successfully lit up (Fig. 5(d)). Furthermore, the Ni-Se-N3-C SAC based rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery could be stably operated with 76 charge-discharge cycles for 20 h at a continuous current density of 2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(e)), demonstrating its great potential for practical application in CO2 conversion and electricity generation. 4. Conclusions In summary, chalcogen heteroatoms (e.g., S, Se, and Te) were incorporated into the symmetric nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N4-C) configuration to obtain Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs with asymmetric coordination for eCO2RR. Among these obtained Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, Ni-Se-N3-C reveals superior activity for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion, with CO selectivity reaching ~98% at −0.70 V versus RHE. Encouragingly, the Ni-Se-N3-C cathode powered Zn-CO2 battery affords the promising performance for chemical energy to electrical energy conversion with peak power density of 1.82 mW cm−2 at a current density of ~2 mA cm−2 during the discharge process and an outstanding rechargeable stability for long time operation. In-situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of chalcogen heteroatoms into the Ni-N4-C configuration would break its coordination symmetry and trigger charge redistribution, and then regulate the intermediate behaviors and thermodynamic reaction pathways for eCO2RR. It should be noted that, in comparison to the introduced heteroatoms in Ni-S-N3-C and Ni-Te-N3-C, the introduced Se atoms in Ni-Se-N3-C could significantly raise the d-band center of central Ni atoms and thus remarkably lower the energy barrier for the RDS of *COOH formation, which in turn improves the CO2-to-CO selectivity. This investigation deepens the insights into the determinative effects of strategic heteroatom doping on the coordination environments and electronic structures of central metal atoms in SACs, and also provides an exemplar of success for the rational design of SACs for eCO2RR with high activity and selectivity.

        "dc:description": "The electronic configuration of central metal atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs) is pivotal in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, chalcogen heteroatoms (e.g., S, Se, and Te) were incorporated into the symmetric nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-N4-C) configuration to obtain Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs with asymmetric coordination presented for central Ni atoms. Among these obtained Ni-X-N3-C (X: S, Se, and Te) SACs, Ni-Se-N3-C exhibited superior eCO2RR activity, with CO selectivity reaching ~98% at −0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The Zn-CO2 battery integrated with Ni-Se-N3-C as cathode and Zn foil as anode achieved a peak power density of 1.82 mW cm–2 and maintained remarkable rechargeable stability over 20 h. In-situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the chalcogen heteroatoms doped into the Ni-N4-C configuration would break coordination symmetry and trigger charge redistribution, and then regulate the intermediate behaviors and thermodynamic reaction pathways for eCO2RR. Especially, for Ni-Se-N3-C, the introduced Se atoms could significantly raise the d-band center of central Ni atoms and thus remarkably lower the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *COOH formation, contributing to the promising eCO2RR performance for high selectivity CO production by competing with hydrogen evolution reaction.",
