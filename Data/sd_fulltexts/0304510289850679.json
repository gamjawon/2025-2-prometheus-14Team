D, 16129 Genoa (Italy) (Received April 15,1988; accepted June 2, 1988) Summary The FT-IR spectra of the surface species arising from the adsorption of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid on pure vanadia and vanadia- silica are discussed. On both surfaces methanol adsorbs mainly in the form of methoxy groups, and is oxidized to a transient dioxymethylene species that desorbs near 450 K. Formaldehyde is adsorbed at low temperature in the form of dioxymethylene and polyoxymethylene species, that are weakly bonded and desorb near room temperature, leaving the clean surface. Neither formaldehyde nor methanol produces surface formate groups by oxidation, in spite of the usual stability of these species when arising from formic acid adsorption. This is interpreted as evidence of the lability of dioxymethylene species towards formaldehyde desorption, as a key catalyst requirement to induce high selectivity towards formaldehyde in methanol oxidation. Introduction The catalytic oxidation of methanol is carried out industrially for the production of formaldehyde. Two types of processes have been developed, one involving oxidative dehydrogenation over silver catalysts [1] and one consisting of a purely oxidative route carried out over ferric molybdate catalysts [2]. In appropriate conditions, pure vanadia also behaves as a highly selective catalyst for formaldehyde production [3], with yields of the order of 97%. Recently it has been shown that other catalysts, such as molybdenum-tin oxides [4] and vanadium-titanium oxides [5,6], are useful for the selective oxidation of methanol to methyl formate. Transition metal oxides such as cobalt or copper oxides are the most effective for catalytic methanol combustion [7]. Based on FT-IR and flow-reactor catalytic results, a mechanism has been recently proposed for the methanol oxidation reaction over vanadia- 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 242 titania [8]. It has also been suggested that, provided the effect of the surface area and of the chemical nature of the catalyst are taken into account, this mechanism may be generalized to oxide-catalyzed processes giving formaldehyde selectively, and also to catalytic combustion. The present paper reports a FT-IR study of methanol adsorption and oxidation on pure vanadia, in order to verify some features of the above mechanism for this material also which may give formaldehyde with high selectivity. Results are also reported concerning vanadia-siliea, which has been tested for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [9] and is thought to be constituted, in contrast to vanadia-titania, by small vanadia particles dispersed on the silica surface [10]. The present data may also contribute to explain the effect of the support, which drastically modifies the behaviour of the vanadia-based catalysts. Experimental The fumed pure vanadia sample (18 m2 g~'1) was supplied by Degussa (Hanau, F.R.G.) and has been characterized previously [11]. Vanadia-siliea (18% V^Os by weight) was prepared by impregnation using a boiling aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate and Aerosil 130 (130 m2 g~1, Degussa) as the support, as reported in [12]. After impregnation, the sample was dried overnight at 393 K and then calcined at 723 K. for 2 h. Identical data on this sample are reported in [12]. The experimental technique is the same as that reported in [8] and [11]. Formaldehyde gas was prepared by evaporating solid paraformaldehyde in vacua. Methanol, formic acid and paraformaldehyde were from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Results Figure la shows the spectrum of the species formed on the surface of activated vanadia after contact with methanol at room temperature. A sharp strong doublet is observed at 1448, 1435 cm\"1 (the latter more intense), with a weaker band at 1155 cm~1 and a stronger one at 1070 cm\"1. All these bands, which are almost unperturbed by treatment at 393 K, correspond to those of methoxy groups [13,14]. They are assigned to the two CHg bending modes, a methyl rocking mode and the CO stretching mode. The CH stretching modes are observed near 2930 and 2830 cm\"1 (Fig. 2b). All these features are similar to those observed on vanadia-titania 'monolayer' catalysts [8]. A broad weak band near 1380 cm\"1, much weakened by evacuation at 393 K, is assigned to the in-plane COH deformation of un- dissociated adsorbed methanol [14,15]. Evacuation at 490 K results in a decrease of the methoxy group bands, and in the appearance of additional strong bands at 1110 and 1148 cm~1 (Fig. Ib), due to a new compound that will be identified later. All bands disappear completely on evacuation at 520 K (Fig. Ic). 243 1800 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 WAVENUMBERS CM\". WAVENUMBERS CM\" Fig. 1.

FT-IR spectra of species arising from the adsorption of formaldehyde at 170 K (a) and of methanol at room temperature (b) on pure vanadia. The spectra of the species formed on a vanadia-silica catalyst by methanol adsorption are shown in Fig. 3. In this case the v(CO) region is not available, due to the cut-off below 1300 cm\"1 arising from the Si-0 stretch- ing modes of the support. Sharp r(CH) bands are observed at 2934 and 2832 cm~1, with a broader one at 2978 cm\"1, together with CH bending bands at 1452 and 1435 cm\"1. Evacuation at increasing temperatures up to 520 K causes a progressive decrease in intensity of the bending bands, with clear evidence for a more stable shoulder at 1460 cm~1. Correspondingly, in the f(CH) region it becomes clear that the above-cited bands are formed by two doublets at 2958, 2855 cm~1 (due to species more resistant to evacuation) and at 2936, 2832 cm~1 (less resistant). The former species may be identified as methoxy groups bonded to silicon, from the similarity to the bands observed on methoxylated silica [16] and high-silica zeolite ZSM-5 [17]. The latter species, with their higher lability and the similarity of the spec- troscopic features to those observed on pure vanadia, is identified as a methoxy group bonded to vanadium oxide particles. It is interesting to note that the same considerations discussed in [8] for methoxy groups on vanadia-titania (concerning the high intensity of the deformation modes and 244 3100 3000 2900 2800 2700 1500 1400 1300 HAVENUMBERS CM\"1'.

FT-IR spectra of species arising from the adsorption of methanol at room tem- perature on vanadia-silica, followed by evacuation at room temperature (a), 410 K (b), 470K(c)and520K(d). their ratio, as well as the low value of the v(CH) and v(CO) frequencies) suggest that these methoxy groups are covalently bonded to single V centers, the spectrum being similar to that of organic methoxo- compounds. Heat treatment under evacuation of the 'methoxylated' vanadia-silica surface causes only the progressive disappearance of the methoxy groups, without formation of any other detectable adsorbed species. In Fig. 4 the spectra of the species arising from the adsorption of formic acid on vanadia are reported. The spectrum corresponds to that expected for formate ions [18]: the strongest bands are observed at 1568 cm\"1 (asymmetric towards higher frequencies; v^g(COO~)), at 1390 cm~1 (v(CH)) and at 1377 cm~1 (asymmetric towards lower frequencies, i^wm^OO\")). Weaker bands at 1690 and 1220 cm\"1 arise from adsorbed undissociated formic acid, in small amounts, and decrease rapidly on evacua- tion at room temperature (Fig. 4b). The adsorbed formate species are stable upon evacuation up to 470 K, at which temperature they begin to disappear. On vanadia-silica (Fig. 6e) formic acid adsorption produces similar bands (1569, 1385, 1372 cm~1) although with some relevant differences in the intensity ratios. Moreover, a strong band also appears at 1730 cm\"!, probably due to formate species bonded to silicon in a covalent form. Also on vanadia-silica, formate ions disappear upon evacuation at 470 K. Figure 5 shows the spectrum of the species arising from adsorption of formaldehyde on vanadia at 170 K. Several bands of the spectrum, i.e. the r(CH)s (shown in Fig. 2a) at 2980 and 2920 cm~1 with a broad weak band near 2800 cm\"1, as well as the bands at 1238, 1225 cm\"1 and at 1120 and 1105 cm~1, correspond to those of the linear polymer of formaldehyde, 245 1800 1600 1400 WAVENUMBERS CM\"1.

To the same species are also assigned the weaker bands at 1470, 1430 and 1380 cm~1 [18]. This species is almost stable on evacuation at 270 K. Other bands instead disappear on evacuation at this temperature: they are found at 1485, 1410 (both weak), 1285 (medium strong) and 1177, 1162 cm\"1 (very strong) and probably also near 1120 and 1080 cm~1 (superimposed on the strongest band of the polymer). All these bands correspond well with those of dioxymethylene species, as discussed in detail previously [18,19]. The decomposition of both dioxymethylene and polyoxymethylene does not leave on the surface any surface species, but restores near 290 K the clean vanadia surface. A very weak band with maxima near 1715 and 1680 cm\"1 is observed only at 170 K, very probably due to v(CO) of formaldehyde species adsorbed as such. It is worth noting that the bands formed by decomposition of methoxy species near 490 K, cited above, are similar to the most intense ones assigned to dioxymethylene. It is then concluded that heat treatment of methoxy groups forms dioxymethylene species at the expense of the reduction of surface vanadium centers. Dioxymethylene probably rapidly desorbs as formaldehyde, thus leaving a clean although slightly reduced surface. 246 3100 3000 5900 2BOO 2700 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 ,- KAVENUMBEBS CM\" Fig. 6.

(e) FT-IR spectrum of species arising from formic acid adsorption. The adsorption of formaldehyde at 170 K on vanadia-silica (Fig. 6) is in the form of a molecularly H-bonded species (v(CH) 2995, 2870, 2822 cm\"1; v(C=0) 1727 cm\"1; v(CH^) 1501 cm\"1), as in the case of pure silica [18], although a second molecular form (v(C=0) 1705 cm~1; [CH; 1488 cm\"1) and some polymer may be also observed. At higher temperatures (240 - 300 K) the dominant adsorbed form is the linear polymer (bands at 2980, 2915, 2795, 1485, 1470, 1390 cm-1). However bands near 1480 and at 1410 cm\"! and a shoulder near 2850 cm~1 certainly correspond to a more labile species, very likely dioxymethylene. Evacuation at room temperature only leaves traces of the polymer, which disappear completely at 370 K. No other species are observed in any conditions. Discussion The behaviour of the Ci molecules methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid on the surfaces of pure vanadia and vanadia-silica is rather parallel, considering that in the latter case the silica surface is in part exposed and also acts in adsorption. This behaviour appears to be noticeably different with respect to that observed previously on vanadia-titania catalysts. The differences, as we will specify below, may be related to the different behaviour of these catalysts in methanol oxidation, and both are possibly related to the different chemical properties of the surfaces. As we have dis- cussed previously [8, 20], the experimental conditions of our spectroscopic investigations appear sufficiently close to those of oxidation reactions (carried out in flow reactors near atmospheric pressures and at moderate temperatures) to be taken as significant for mechanistic studies. 247 Literature data show that vanadia and vanadia-silica act as very selec- tive catalysts in methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, other compounds such as the dehydration product dimethyl ether and the oxidation products dimethoxymethane (the ketal of formaldehyde), methyl formate and CO being obtained as byproducts [3,21,22]. When vanadia-titania catalysts are used, the same products, except dimethyl ether, are observed [5, 8, 23], but much higher selectivities may be obtained in methyl formate at almost total conversion. Our spectroscopic results, presented here for pure vanadia and vanadia- silica, and in [8] for vanadia-titania, show that methoxy species bonded to vanadium sites are formed on all three catalysts by methanol adsorption at room temperature. These species have the same spectroscopic features and similar thermal stability in the three cases. In the case of pure vanadia, as follows from our previous discussion [II], the model reported in Scheme 1 may be proposed for the adsorption of methanol, suggested to take place on faces perpendicular to the layers forming the VzOs structure, such as the 100 and 001 faces. These species appear to be oxidized earlier on vanadia- titania (near 420 - 470 K [8]) than on pure and silica-supported vanadia, as detected by the lowering of their characteristic bands. This agrees with the higher activity of vanadia-titania than that of vanadia in methanol oxidation [21]. Also, the formate ions observed in all three cases as the main products of formic acid adsorption are spectroscopically similar and have a similar stability range. an 0=V<. 'o H-o-H ...0^< '0 dry surface wet surface nethanol adsorbed Scheme 1. Instead, the behaviour of adsorbed formaldehyde strongly differs in the case of pure and silica-supported vanadia, with respect to vanadia-titania. In fact, both on vanadia and on vanadia-silica, formaldehyde adsorption only produces polymeric species and dioxymethylene at low temperatures. Both species appear to be very unstable towards desorption on these catalysts, because signals disappear near 270 K, and do not leave evidence of any other adsorbed species. This behaviour is very different from that observed on several ionic oxides [18], including vanadia-titania [8]. Here dioxy- methylene species appears to be the key adsorbed form of formaldehyde; it is stable even up to 370 K and in any case is strongly bonded, giving upon heating both methoxy and formate groups by disproportionation, or formate groups only by oxidation. These differences may be explained assuming that the desorption of formaldehyde from dioxymethylene species is much faster than its reaction on vanadia and vanadia-silica, while on vanadia-titania [8], 248 as on many other oxides [18], its desorption is much slower and oxidation or disproportionation may occur. This is why we do not observe formate ions from methanol or formaldehyde oxidation on vanadia and vanadia- silica surfaces, unlike almost all other oxide surfaces. The present results, then, seem to confirm our previous hypotheses con- cerning the generalized mechanism of methanol oxidation over oxide catalysts (Fig. 7) and the catalyst requirements needed to shift the selectivity towards formaldehyde or, alternatively, towards methyl formate or even towards carbon oxides. Among very active catalysts, where methoxy group oxidation (step 2) starts at sufficiently low temperatures to avoid substantial condensation to dimethyl ether (step 11), catalysts selective towards formaldehyde must allow desorption of this molecule (step 3) before its further oxidation (step 6) or disproportionation (step 10). They then must be poorly nucleophilic, thus inducing sufficient thermal lability of dioxy- methylene with respect to its desorption as formaldehyde (steps 4 and 3). As we have found here, this is the case for pure vanadia and vanadia-silica, which, accordingly, allow very high selectivities in formaldehyde even at almost total conversion [3]. This is probably also the case for bulk molyb- dena, where formate ions have not been selected during heat treatment of adsorbed methanol [24], and for the industrial ferric molybdate catalysts, for which a rather similar mechanism has been proposed [25]. This agrees with the fact that catalysts which allow the production of formaldehyde by CH-OH $ CH OCH- A\"2 0^ 0 CH OH V 5 H.CCOCH,), 5 - J - ' 3> HCOOH 9 Fig. 7. Proposed generalized mechanism for heterogeneously catalyzed methanol oxida- tion. 249 methanol oxidation with very high yields show very low activity in the Tischenko dimerization of formaldehyde to dimethyl ether [26], for which equilibrium (4) is certainly necessarily shifted towards dioxymethylene. In contrast, catalysts selective towards methyl formate must block formaldehyde as dioxymethylene, allowing further oxidation to formate ions. However, it is also necessary for these catalysts that the formate ions are not so labile, allowing the reaction of these species with unreacted methanol to give methyl formate (step 8) before the formates are decom- posed into CO (step 7). Very active and nucleophilic catalysts such as CuO [27] and Fe2C>3 [28], with which formaldehyde very rapidly evolves to formates and the formates are decomposed at very low temperatures, behave as nonselective combustion catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The FT-IR spectra of the surface species arising from the adsorption of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid on pure vanadia and vanadia-silica are discussed. On both surfaces methanoi adsorbs mainly in the form of methoxy groups, and is oxidized to a transient dioxymethylene species that desorbs near 450 K. Formaldehyde is adsorbed at low temperature in the form of dioxymethylene and polyoxymethylene species, that are weakly bonded and desorb near room temperature, leaving the clean surface. Neither formaldehyde nor methanoi produces surface formate groups by oxidation, in spite of the usual stability of these species when arising from formic acid adsorption. This is interpreted as evidence of the lability of dioxymethylene species towards formaldehyde desorption, as a key catalyst requirement to induce high selectivity towards formaldehyde in methanoi oxidation.",
