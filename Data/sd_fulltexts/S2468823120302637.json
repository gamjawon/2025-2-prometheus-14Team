Graphical abstract The effect of Na promoter on the catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/hydroxyapatite (Pd-Cu/HAP) for room-temperature CO oxidation has been investigated. The HAP supports were prepared via the precipitation method. The Na promoter was used to modify the HAP support, and the corresponding Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were synthesized by an impregnation approach. Compared with non-Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst, the catalytic activities of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were enhanced gradually with the increase of sodium content. The excellent catalytic performance of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst could be attributed to the presence of more active Cu(OH)Cl species and less weak basic sites, especially, higher active surface Pd+ species and more surface Cu+ species. Keywords Pd-Cu/hydroxyapatite Na promoter CO oxidation Room temperature 1 Introduction CO, a toxic pollutant, mainly emits from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and vehicle exhaust emission, and causes great harm on the human life. Therefore, the abatement of CO is an important research issue that needs to be eagerly solved. The low-temperature catalytic oxidation is an effective method to remove CO [1–3]. Currently, low-temperature CO oxidation has drawn a lot of attention due to its significant practical applications, such as CO gas sensor, air purification, gas mask and purification of hydrogen for PEMFCs, etc. [4–6]. In recent decades, the catalytic systems for low-temperature CO oxidation under investigation include noble metal catalysts [7–10], transition metal oxides [11–16] and supported Wacker catalysts [17–20]. Among a number of catalysts investigated for low-temperature CO oxidation, supported noble-metal catalysts are most commonly used in practical application [21]. In order to achieve effective utilization of metal components, the well dispersion of metal components on the support has been an important issue for researchers [22]. Therefore, the advent of single-atom catalysts has received extensive attention. Moreover, there have been many reports on single-atom catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation [23,24]. However, unlike traditional nanoparticles, single-atom catalysts have more rigorous requirements in terms of size, structural effects, and strong interactions with the support, which make researchers face a huge challenge in designing and characterizing single-atom catalysts. The supported Wacker catalysts (PdCl2-CuCl2/support) have advantages of resistance to halide poisoning and water vapor, in respect that the composition is rich in Cl− and water vapor participates in the catalytic reaction process. Thus, the supported Wacker catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation have received wide attention from academics [25–27]. Talking about the supported Wacker catalysts, many literatures about the impact of support on the catalytic performance of catalysts have been reported. Concretely, the supports include activated carbon [17–19], Al2O3 [28–31], molecular sieve [32] and palygorskite [33–36]. The abovementioned supported Wacker catalysts present good catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation. However, owing to the weak interaction between active Cu species and activated carbon, the loss of chlorine easily occurs during the reaction process and the catalyst is irreversibly deactivated [36]. The alumina possesses strong hydrophilicity owing to its surface abundant hydroxyl groups, so that water vapor is prone to accumulate on the catalyst during the reaction process, which further induces the aggregation and transformation of active Cu phase, and finally leads to the catalyst deactivation [30]. The poor stability for zeolite-based catalysts mainly results from pore full of water, which decreases the gas-liquid interfacial surface area [32]. In recent years, our previous works have carried out the preparation of Pd-Cu/palygorskite catalysts and investigated the catalytic performance for room-temperature CO oxidation in humid circumstances [33–36]. The results exhibited that the Pd-Cu/palygorskite catalyst after calcination presents active Cu(OH)Cl species with a smaller crystallite size and a stronger interaction between Pd and Cu species compared with the uncalcined Pd-Cu/palygorskite catalyst, which enhances the CO catalytic oxidation activity [35]. Moreover, the effect of ultrasonic treatment on the catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/palygorskite catalyst was also studied for room-temperature CO oxidation [36]. It was found that the ultrasonic treatment could eliminate quartz impurities from palygorskite, which contributes to the proper hydrophobic of support and further enhances the catalytic stability. Although palygorskite supported Wacker catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation have achieved good catalytic performance, there is an uncertainty in the relationship between the catalytic performance and structural properties of the catalyst, which is due to the difference in the composition and property of palygorskite originated from different habitats. Therefore, the exploration of new catalyst systems with suitable supports still remains a challenge. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HAP) is a phosphate mineral, belonging to the hexagonal system, and owns two types of channel [37]. These structural characteristics result in favorable ion exchange property, excellent chemical and thermal stability and tunable acid/base property [38]. HAP has been widely used as adsorbents, biomaterials, ion-exchangers and applied in numerous catalytic reactions, such as formaldehyde oxidation [39], catalytic conversion of glycerol [40], and catalytic reduction of NOx [41,42], etc. Boukha et al. [43] studied the Pd/HAP catalysts with different loading amounts of Pd (0.5–2 %) for CO total oxidation, CO preferential oxidation and water gas shift reactions. They found that Pd(0.5)/HAP has higher catalytic activity and superior stability because of the high reducibility and large oxygen storage capacity. Wang et al. [44] employed a deposition-precipitation method to synthesize Au/HAP nanocatalysts by using HAP supports with different crystallinity. It was concluded that the HAP support with higher crystallinity could produce more Au0 on the catalyst surface, which promotes the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Huang et al. [45] explored the influence of calcination atmosphere (H2, He and O2) on the catalytic performance of Au/HAP catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. Among three catalysts, the Au/HAP-O2 catalyst showed the highest steady state activity and best stability, which comes from the limited surface basicity to prevent the accumulation of carbonate-like species. These reported literatures prove that HAP is a potential material as promising alternative support of the supported Wacker catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. Moreover, the addition of alkali metals is often used to improve the catalytic activity of catalyst [46]. There have been some reports concerning the effects of alkali metals on the catalytic performance of activated carbon supported Wacker catalysts [47,48]. Jiang et al. [47] examined the effect of different alkali metal promoters (Li, Na, K) on the catalytic activities of PdCl2-CuCl2/AC catalysts for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate. Among three promoters, the addition of K realized the best catalytic activity, which results from the less chlorine loss. Wang et al. [48] confirmed that the catalytic activities of PdCl2-CuCl2/AC catalysts improved by different K promoters rank in the following sequence: KCl > KOH > CH3COOK > K2CO3. Particularly, the presence of KCl facilitated the reducibility of Cu2+ species, which is beneficial to the oxidation of Pd0 to active Pd2+. In the present work, we synthesized HAP supports by the precipitation method with NH3·H2O as the precipitant, modified the HAP supports with NaNO3 by controlling the soaking time, and further prepared Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts via an impregnation approach. The samples were characterized by ICP-AES, N2-physisorption, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, H2-TPR and CO2-TPD. The Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were tested for room-temperature CO oxidation. Furthermore, the reason why the addition of Na promoter enhances the catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst for room-temperature CO oxidation was demonstrated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Support preparation The stoichiometric HAP support was prepared through the precipitation method. 0.06 mol (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.1 mol Ca(NO3)2·4H2O were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water, then 30 mL ammonia (10 % NH3·H2O) was added to above mixed solution. The mixed solution was stirred and the temperature was maintained at 100 °C for 2 h. Finally, the resultant sample was dried at 120 °C for 6 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. The support obtained was marked as HAP. Further, the certain amount of HAP support was dispersed in a 40 mL of NaNO3 aqueous solution with the concentration of 1 mol/L. The mixed suspension was placed for 1 or 3 h under water bath at 25 °C, respectively. Then the suspension was filtered and the resultant sample was dried at 120 °C for 3 h. The supports obtained were designed as HAP-Na-1 and HAP-Na (HAP-Na-3), respectively. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were synthesized by the incipient wetness impregnation approach as follows: 3.64 g of CuCl2·2H2O was fully dissolved in 4 mL of H2O, and 4 mL of PdCl2 aqueous solution (9.97 mg/mL) was added for mixing. Then, 10 g of prepared supports were mixed with the above solution. After being aged for 3 h, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 6 h and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h. The calcined samples were not subjected to reduction treatment. The corresponding catalysts were Pd-Cu/HAP, Pd-Cu/HAP-Na-1 and Pd-Cu/HAP-Na, respectively. The samples were further labelled as PC, PC-Na-1 and PC-Na, respectively. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The ICP-AES, N2-physisorption, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, H2-TPR and CO2-TPD characterizations are consistent with our early publications [33,34,49,50]. 2.4 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activity test process and the calculation of CO conversion are identical to our previous paper [34]. More details about catalyst characterization and catalytic activity test can be found in Supplementary material. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Catalytic performance for room-temperature CO oxidation The catalytic performances of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts prepared by different HAP supports are presented in Fig. 1 . Under the reaction conditions, the catalysts possess different CO conversions. Among them, it can be found that PC-Na exhibits the highest catalytic activity, which shows above 70 % CO conversion. With the increase of reaction time, the CO conversion keeps stable. Similarly, PC-Na-1 behaves above 50 % CO conversion, however, that is only 40 % over PC in the same case. It is noteworthy that compared with the CO conversion of PC, those of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 increase when Na promoter is added. Thus, the addition of Na promoter could enhance the catalytic activity of Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst for room-temperature CO oxidation. Besides, the effects of water and Cu on PC-Na and PC catalysts are also studied, respectively (Figs. S1 and S2). The results show that, when water feed is stopped, the CO conversion of PC-Na drops rapidly. However, once water feed is restarted, the CO conversion recovers quickly. As for the effect of Cu, the monometallic Pd/HAP catalyst exhibits poorer catalytic activity compared with PC. These results indicate that water and Cu are indispensable for remaining the high catalytic activity of supported PdCl2-CuCl2 catalysts for CO oxidation, which have been confirmed in many literatures [25,27,29]. In the classic Wacker chemistry, Pd2+ or Pd+ is firstly reduced by CO and water to form Pd0, then Pd0 is re-oxidized to Pd2+ or Pd+ by Cu2+, and Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+ simultaneously. Finally, Cu+ is re-oxidized back to Cu2+ by oxygen and the catalytic cycle is completed. Thus, the roles of water and Cu are essential for supported Wacker catalysts. The catalytic stability of PC-Na is further investigated for longer reaction time and the results are shown in Fig. S3. It can be observed that PC-Na shows a better catalytic stability and the catalytic activity is unchanged for 4 h, and then the catalytic activity of PC-Na decreases slightly. However, when the water vapor in the feed gas is temporarily cut off, the catalytic activity can be gradually restored. The above results indicate that water vapor condenses on the catalyst surface, resulting in the slow decline of catalytic activity. 3.2 ICP-AES analysis ICP-AES was used to measure the chemical composition of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the actual loadings of Pd and Cu are close to the nominal values (Pd 0.35 wt%, Cu 12 wt%), and the Ca/P ratios of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 are almost the same as the theoretical ratio (1.67). The measured sodium contents of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 are 2.19 wt% and 1.74 wt%, respectively, and no sodium is detected in PC. 3.3 XRD analysis The crystal structure of HAP supports was investigated by XRD technique. The diffraction peaks of HAP are identified by using a standard JCPDS files (JCPDS#09-0432). As shown in Fig. 2 , the characteristic diffraction peaks of HAP are observed at 2θ = 25.9°, 31.8°, 32.2°, 32.9°, 34.0°, 39.8° in each sample, which can be attributed to the (002), (211), (112), (300), (202), (310) crystalline planes, respectively [40]. These reflections correspond to the standard pattern of HAP, indicating that the HAP supports have been successfully synthesized. Moreover, the XRD pattern of HAP-Na shows additional peaks due to the presence of NaNO3 (JCPDS#36−1474, 2θ = 29.4°) and Ca10Na(PO4)7 (JCPDS#45−0339, 2θ = 31.2° and 34.5°), respectively. It is suggested that a part of NaNO3 adsorbs on the surface of HAP support, and another part of sodium may undergo ion exchange with calcium. The formation of Ca10Na(PO4)7 is caused by the doping of Na+ into the sites where Ca2+ should stabilize HAP structure. Thus, it can be inferred from the formation of Ca10Na(PO4)7 that the addition of Na promoter may have disturbed the structure of HAP to some degree [39]. However, compared with the XRD pattern of HAP-Na, that of HAP-Na-1 only presents the diffraction peak of NaNO3. This may be due to the short soaking time, a large amount of sodium stays on the surface of HAP-Na-1 support. The XRD patterns of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 3 . After loading Pd and Cu active components, XRD patterns of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts also show well-formed hydroxyapatite structure. However, there are some additional reflections emerging on the XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 8.6° and 15.0° can be attributed to the Cu2P2O7 (JCPDS#51-0202) and Cu2(OH)PO4 (JCPDS#77−0922) species, respectively, which only show in PC. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 16.2° and 17.6° belong to the Cu2Cl(OH)3 (JCPDS#50−1559) species. It is well known that the Cu2Cl(OH)3 species has been considered as the active Cu phase of supported Wacker catalysts for CO oxidation [29]. Compared with PC, the addition of Na promoter has a great impact on the formation of Cu species in PC-Na and PC-Na-1. The new diffraction peak arises at 2θ = 16.0°, 35.7° and 45.5°, which can be assigned to the Cu(OH)Cl (JCPDS#23-1063) species. It is interestingly discovered that PC-Na and PC-Na-1 possess the active Cu species in the form of Cu(OH)Cl, which is different from the Cu2Cl(OH)3 species of PC. Contrasted with HAP-Na and HAP-Na-1, the diffraction peak of NaNO3 disappears, which results from the decomposition of NO3 − after calcination. However, the Ca10Na(PO4)7 species still retains in PC-Na. Moreover, no diffraction peaks resulting from Pd or its oxides are observed in any Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts, indicating that the particle size of Pd species is beyond the XRD detection limit. 3.4 N2-physisorption analysis The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are depicted in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4, all samples exhibit typical type IV with a hysteresis loop characteristic for mesoporous materials [51]. The textural properties of HAP supports and Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are listed in Table 2 . It is worth mentioning that all samples show low specific surface areas (7.7–30.5 m2 g−1), and the addition of Na promoter improves the textural properties of HAP support and Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst. Compared with HAP, impregnation of Pd and Cu active components results in the decrease of specific surface area of PC, which may be due to the penetration of active components into the pores of HAP [52]. At the opposite, the specific surface area of PC-Na increases after loading Pd and Cu active components. Based on XRD and FT-IR characterization results, the increase of specific surface area may originate from the decomposition of nitrate after calcination. 3.5 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra of HAP supports and Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are presented in Fig. 5 . It can be observed that four bands emerge at 1091, 1043, and 602, 561 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the asymmetrical stretching (V3) and bending (V4) modes of PO4 3−, respectively. The symmetric stretching and bending modes (V1 and V2) of PO4 3− are also found at around 963 and 469 cm−1, respectively [53]. Meanwhile, the OH stretching and liberation modes caused by the structure of HAP support are discovered at around 3572 and 634 cm−1, respectively [41]. The existence of these absorption bands confirms that the fundamental structure of HAP support is well preserved in each sample. Different from the FT-IR spectra of HAP supports, Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts exhibit bands at 3450 and 3352 cm−1, which can be assigned to the −OH asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of copper chloride hydroxide (Cu2Cl(OH)3, Cu(OH)Cl) [27,31]. The bands at 3427 and 1626 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching and bending bands of hydroxyl group in the adsorbed water, respectively [41]. In addition, it is worthy to note that there is a characteristic absorption band in HAP-Na and HAP-Na-1, which presents at 1386 cm−1 and results from the vibration mode of NO3 − [54]. However, the band at 1386 cm−1 disappears in PC-Na and PC-Na-1, which may be due to the decomposition of NO3- after calcination. This phenomenon is consistent with the results of XRD. 3.6 XPS analysis The Pd 3d and Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that the Pd 3d XPS spectrum of PC consists of two peaks, which appear at 338.1 and 343.3 eV, respectively. This declares that Pd species of PC exists in the form of Pd2+ [55]. The Pd 3d XPS spectra of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 show peaks of Pd2+ species and another pair of peaks at 335.8 and 341.1 eV that correspond to the presence of Pd+ species [56]. Shen et al. [27] applied in situ DRIFTS technology to study the reaction mechanism of Pd-Cu-Clx/Al2O3 catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation, and found that Pd+ species is much more active than Pd2+ species. This should be a crucial factor that causes the higher catalytic activity of PC-Na and PC-Na-1. The Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra (Fig. 6(b)) of the catalysts consist of two peaks at about 934.8 and 932.6 eV, the former is attributed to Cu2+ species, and the latter is assigned to Cu+ species [27]. It can be found that the catalysts possess the similar BE value of Cu2+ species, suggesting that a similar electronic environment around Cu2+ species presents in the catalysts. However, there is some change in the BE value of Cu+ species, and a difference of 0.5 eV is observed between PC and PC-Na (or PC-Na-1). The relatively higher BE value may demonstrate that Cu+ species of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 is in the state of lower electron cloud density [57]. According to the areas of their XPS peaks, the surface compositions of the catalysts are quantified and summarized in Table 3 . Based on the element sensitivity factor method, the peaks of Pd 3d5/2 and the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 are fitted. The relative content of surface Pd2+ species in the catalysts are calculated. The results show that PC-Na exhibits a similar Pd2+/(Cu+ + Cu2+) value (0.079) with PC (0.075) and PC-Na-1 (0.071). In terms of the Pd+/Pd2+ ratio, it can be seen that PC-Na possesses a larger value (0.239) than PC-Na-1 (0.194). Moreover, as shown in Table 3, the ratios of Cu+/(Cu++Cu2+) in PC, PC-Na-1 and PC-Na are 0.247, 0.398 and 0.434, respectively. It can be found that compared with PC, PC-Na and PC-Na-1 possess more surface Cu+ species, and the amount of surface Cu+ species increases with the increase of sodium content. This suggests that the presence of Na promoter leads to more Cu species in the form of Cu+. The more surface Cu+ species on PC-Na and PC-Na-1 might be related with the charge compensation effect created by the substitution of Ca2+ by Na+. The inset shows the XPS results of used catalyst (PC-Na-1-U) after reaction time of 2 h. It can be seen that there is no significant difference in the surface composition of PC-Na-1 and PC-Na-1-U. Guo et al. [58] reported that Cu+ species is the main adsorption and active center of CO oxidation for copper-based catalysts. However, for supported Wacker catalysts, the situation is different and complex owing to the presence of H2O. Shen et al. [59] applied DFT calculation to explore the CO oxidation reaction mechanism in the case of Pd-Cu-Clx/Al2O3 catalyst. The results indicated that CO adsorbs mostly on PdOH sites and O2 mostly on CuCl sites in the presence of H2O. Namely, Pd species is the key active sites for CO and Cu+ species is the active sites for O2. Furthermore, compared with Pd2+ species, Pd+ species has been confirmed to be more conductive to the adsorption and activation of CO [56]. Combined the results with this work, it is reasonable to conclude that higher active surface Pd+ species and more surface Cu+ species may further improve the catalytic activities of PC-Na and PC-Na-1. 3.7 H2-TPR analysis The H2-TPR curves of HAP supports and Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7, the supports have no obvious reduction behavior. The reduction curves of three catalysts can be divided into low temperature region (T < 350 °C) and high temperature region (T > 350 °C). In the low temperature region, the H2-TPR curve of PC exhibits three reduction peaks, namely, α1, β1 and γ1. The peak α1 at 204 °C and peak β1 at 248 °C can be ascribed to the co-reduction of Pd species and highly dispersed Cu2Cl(OH)3 species and the co-reduction of Pd species and microcrystalline Cu2Cl(OH)3 species, respectively. The peak γ1 at 260 °C should be assigned to the reduction of crystalline Cu2Cl(OH)3 species [29]. Compared with PC, the addition of Na promoter makes the reduction behaviors of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 different. The reduction peaks (α2 and β2) of PC-Na-1 occurs at 202 and 234 °C, which can be attributed to the co-reduction of Pd species and highly dispersed Cu(OH)Cl species and the co-reduction of Pd species and microcrystalline Cu(OH)Cl species, respectively. Moreover, the reduction peaks of PC-Na show at 216, 264 and 302 °C, which are designed as α3, β3 and γ3, respectively. The peaks α3 and β3 may be in connection with the co-reduction of Pd species and Cu(OH)Cl species. The peaks γ3 may be due to the reduction of crystalline Cu(OH)Cl species. According to XRD results, the reduction peaks at high temperature region may associate with the reduction of Cu species formed by exchanging with Ca2+. The peak δ 1 presents at 374 °C, which can be related to the reduction of Cu2P2O7 and Cu2(OH)PO4 species [39]. Similarly, the peak δ 2 and δ 3 at 406 and 440 °C should refer to the reduction of Cu species formed by ion exchange. Considering that the high-temperature reduction peaks of three catalysts originate from the reduction of Cu species formed by ion exchange, which has little contribution to the catalytic activity, the high-temperature reduction peaks in three catalysts are not fitted. Table 4 lists parameters of low-temperature H2 consumption peaks of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts. It can be found that there is no big difference for the amounts of low-temperature H2 consumption of three catalysts. However, compared with PC, the reduction peaks of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 move to higher temperature after the addition of Na promoter. The possible reason is that the addition of Na promoter enhances the synergetic interaction between Pd, Cu species and HAP support. As shown in XPS results, with the addition of Na promoter, the Cu 2p3/2 XPS peaks of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 shift to a higher binding energy, which might be caused by the stronger interaction between Pd, Cu species and HAP support [60]. In addition, TEM characterization results (Fig. S4) also show that the active species dispersion of PC-Na is improved after the addition of Na promoter. Zhai et al. [61] and Konsolakis et al. [62] studied Pt-based catalysts and they found that the presence of alkali metals (sodium or potassium) inhibits the growth of Pt particles, which could improve the metal dispersion. Thus, it is reasonable to consider the improvement in active species dispersion as a possible induction for the increased activity. 3.8 CO2-TPD analysis The CO2-TPD curves of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts are given in Fig. 8 . It can be observed that there is a broad CO2 desorption peak shown at 100–250 °C in all of the catalysts, which corresponds to the weak basic sites [51]. The high-temperature CO2 desorption peaks of the catalysts clearly display at 417, 388 and 396 °C, respectively, which can be attributed to medium strength basic sites. In addition, the high-temperature CO2 desorption peaks of the catalysts move toward a lower temperature when Na promoter is added. This may derive from the coverage or replacement of stronger CO2 adsorption sites by sodium [51]. According to the peak areas, the amounts of basic sites in the catalysts are calculated and listed in Table 5 . It can be seen that the more medium strength basic sites exist in PC-Na and PC-Na-1. The CO oxidation reaction over the catalysts occurs at room temperature, so the weak basic sites should play a major role in the reaction. It is worth noting that compared with PC, PC-Na and PC-Na-1 possess the smaller low-temperature CO2 desorption peak area, indicating that less weak basic sites present in PC-Na and PC-Na-1. Thus, it can be inferred that the relatively easy desorption behavior of CO2 on PC-Na and PC-Na-1 can facilitate to regenerate the active sites [51]. In summary, compared with PC, the addition of Na promoter improves the catalytic performances of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 for room-temperature CO oxidation, which is further enhanced with the increase of sodium content. As seen clearly from the XRD results, PC-Na and PC-Na-1 possess the active Cu species in the form of Cu(OH)Cl, which is different from Cu2Cl(OH)3 of PC. In the reaction of low-temperature CO oxidation and oxidative carbonylation of ethanol to diethyl carbonate, it has been reported that Cu(OH)Cl species is more active than Cu2Cl(OH)3 species, because active Cu(OH)Cl species makes electron transfer between Cu and Pd species more easily [63,64]. More importantly, the XPS results indicate that compared with PC, PC-Na and PC-Na-1 produce higher active surface Pd+ species and more surface Cu+ species, and the amounts of surface Pd+ and Cu+ species increase with the increase of sodium content. Furthermore, based on the CO2-TPD results, the less weak basic sites of PC-Na and PC-Na-1 are suggested to be conducive to the desorption of CO2. These are responsible for the superior catalytic performance of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts for room-temperature CO oxidation. 4 Conclusions The effect of Na promoter on the catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst for room-temperature CO oxidation has been investigated. The results show that compared with PC, the addition of Na promoter enhances the catalytic activities of PC-Na and PC-Na-1. Especially, the CO conversion of PC-Na nearly increases by one time under the same reaction conditions. The XRD analysis indicates that Cu2Cl(OH)3 species presents in PC, but Cu(OH)Cl species exists in PC-Na and PC-Na-1. The XPS results suggest that higher active surface Pd+ and more surface Cu+ species exist on PC-Na and PC-Na-1. Moreover, the CO2-TPD results show that PC-Na and PC-Na-1 possess the less weak basic sites, which is conducive to the desorption of CO2. These are beneficial for the improvement of CO catalytic oxidation performance of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts. Therefore, it can be concluded that the active Cu phase, the surface composition and surface basicity of Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts can be changed by the addition of Na promoter, which is an effective method to promote the catalytic performance for room-temperature CO oxidation.

        "dc:description": "The effect of Na promoter on the catalytic performance of Pd-Cu/hydroxyapatite (Pd-Cu/HAP) for room-temperature CO oxidation has been investigated. The HAP supports were prepared via the precipitation method. The Na promoter was used to modify the HAP support, and the corresponding Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were synthesized by an impregnation approach. Compared with non-Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst, the catalytic activities of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalysts were enhanced gradually with the increase of sodium content. The excellent catalytic performance of Na promoted Pd-Cu/HAP catalyst could be attributed to the presence of more active Cu(OH)Cl species and less weak basic sites, especially, higher active surface Pd+ species and more surface Cu+ species.",
