The photocatalytic reductive coupling of carbon-carbon bonds via pinacol coupling represents a significant transformation in organic synthesis chemistry. Several elegant studies have reported the use of metal or organic photocatalysts in this process, but these often lead to trace metal residues or involve intricate operational procedures. Herein, we report a photoinduced pinacol coupling of carbon-carbon bonds from ketones, achieved under photocatalyst-free conditions using triethoxysilane or Hantzsch ester as the reductant. In the model reaction employing benzophenone as substrate and triethoxysilane as the reductant, the corresponding pinacol product was obtained in 96 % yield under 370 nm LED light irradiation. Similarly, when Hantzsch ester served as the reductant, the pinacol product was obtained in 95 % yield under 423 nm LED light irradiation. The substrate scope demonstrated that six substrates yielded the corresponding products with yields ranging from 40 % to 96 %. Notably, when acetophenone, a substrate with minimal steric hindrance, was used under the established conditions, only 1-phenylethanol was produced. This work introduces two practical methods for the synthesis of carbon-carbon coupling intermediates through pinacol coupling of benzophenone-derived substrates, positioning these methodologies as promising candidates for various applications. Graphical abstract This work introduces two practical methods for the synthesis of carbon-carbon bonds by benzophenone pinacol coupling. Under the conditions of triethoxysilane and 370 nm LED, the yield can reach 96 %. Similarly, a yield of 95 % was obtained under the action of 423 nm LED and Hantzsch ester.

These reactions can be broadly classified into two main types: oxidative coupling [5–14] and reductive coupling [15–18]. Although oxidation coupling of CC bonds, such as Heck coupling [19,20], and others [21–35], is well-known to chemists, reductive coupling of CC bonds is equally an indispensable part of organic synthetic chemistry [36–38]. The pinacol coupling, a typical bimolecular reductive coupling reaction, was first reported in 1859 [39,40]. It involves a mechanism of single-electron transfer in aldehyde or ketone molecules. Most importantly, the products of pinacol coupling, 1,2-diol, possessing two chiral centers, serve as crucial asymmetric chiral reagents [41] and scaffolds for the construction of biologically active molecules [42], and have become a focal point of current research in CC coupling [43,44]. In traditional methods (Scheme 1 , a), the primary strategy involved the reduction of carbonyl compounds using metal reagents or metal complex reagents, such as Mg [45], Al [46], Ti [47] and others [48]. Advancements in pinacol coupling technology, facilitated by photocatalysis, have garnered significant interest due to their mild and eco-friendly methodologies. Several elegant studies have reported the use of metal complexex, such as Ir [49], Cu [50] Sm [3], among others [51], or organic photocatalysts, such as perylene [52], 4CzlPN [53], TX-BI-POP [54], BPC [55], CBZ6 [56], and so forth [57], in this process. Nonetheless, these often result in trace metal residues or involve intricate operational procedures. Recently, the semiconductor photocatalyst has also been developed for this transformation, such as GaN [58], CdS NCs [59] and ZnIn2S4 [60], and others. Additionally, photocatalyst-free conditions have been established in the presence of reducing agents or electron donors, such as IPA/AcOH [61], N2H4•H2O/MeCN [62], HE/DMSO [63], i-Pr2Net/MeCN-H2O [64], HCOOK/EtOH [65], and so on [66,67]. These photocatalyst-free conditions offer environmental advantages and operational simplicity, enabling efficient and versatile chemical syntheses with a diverse range of substrates and high yields. Triethoxysilane, an organosilane compound, has shown great potential as a mild reducing agent in organic chemistry [68] and has been proven useful in chiral asymmetric hydrosilylation reactions of ketones [69]. Hantzsch ester, featuring a 1,4-dihydropyridine ring structure, stands out as another reducing agent [70]. It exhibits remarkable selectivity, capable of selectively reducing specific functional groups without affecting other structural parts, making it a potentially valuable tool in pharmaceutical chemistry [50,71]. Herein, we report a photoinduced reductive coupling of carbon-carbon bonds via pinacol coupling using triethoxysilane or Hantzsch ester as the reductant. In the model reaction employing benzophenone as the substrate, the corresponding pinacol product was obtained in 96 % and 95 % yield, respectively, under triethoxysilane and Hantzsch ester as reductants (Scheme 1, b). 2 Experimental section All commercially available reagents were used without further purification. Unless stated otherwise, all reactions were carried out in glass tube (10 mL) under air atmosphere. A 300 W Xe lamp (CEAULIGHT, CEL-PF300-T8) was used as a light source. The 30 W LED was used as light source. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200–400 mesh). NMR spectra were taken with a Bruker 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) using CDCl3 as the solvent with TMS as internal standard. 2.1 Materials All chemicals are analytical grade and used as received without further purification. 2.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The reaction was performed in a 10 mL glass tube with 5 mL CH3CN containing 0.5 mmol benzophenone (1a) and 2.0 equiv. reductant (H-donor). The reactor was sealed and then irradiated under light. The temperature of the reaction system was kept at 25–35 °C by a fan. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (eluent: petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 20:1–10:1) to give the product 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethane-1,2-diol (2a) as a white solid (88 mg, 96 % yield). Acetophenone as a substrate: The reaction was performed in a 10 mL glass tube with 5 mL CH3CN containing 0.5 mmol acetophenone (1g) and 2.0 equiv. reductant (H-donor). The reactor was sealed and then irradiated under light. The temperature of the reaction system was kept at 25–35 °C by a fan. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (eluent: petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 5:1) to give the product 1-phenylethanol (3g). It should be noted that neither triethoxysilane nor Hantzsch ester undergoes pinacol coupling when serving as reducing agents. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Table 1 , we systematically investigated the reaction performance of the model substrate benzophenone 1a in the presence of triethoxysilane ((EtO)3SiH) or Hantzsch ester (HEH) under light irradiation. We found that the desired product 2a was obtained in high yields of 96 % and 95 % when (EtO)3SiH and HEH were used as reductants, respectively (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Control experiments conducted in the absence of either (EtO)3SiH or HEH demonstrated that the model reaction did not proceed, highlighting the indispensable role of these reductants in the reaction (Table 1, entry 1). Additionally, when Et3SiH was used as an alternative reductant, the desired product 2a was only obtained in a 40 % yield, underscoring the importance of (EtO)3SiH in achieving high yields (Table 1, entries 2–3). The significance of light in the reaction was also investigated (Table 1, entries 5–6). Our results showed that the product 2a was not obtained in the absence of light, emphasizing its crucial role. Further exploration into the wavelengths of the light source revealed that (EtO)3SiH and HEH require different wavelengths for optimal reaction performance in the model system (Fig. 1 ). Specifically, the reaction utilizing (EtO)3SiH as the reductant required 370 nm wavelength LED light, whereas the reaction with HEH required 423 nm wavelength LED light. The light absorption edge of (EtO)3SiH is at approximately 360 nm. In contrast, the light absorption edge of the HEH can extend to around 550 nm (Figure S1–2). Both reactions achieved a yield of over 95 % when the amount of reductant was optimized. Furthermore, it was found that using twice the amount of reductant represented the optimal conditions (Table 1, entries 7–10). With the optimized conditions in hand, we investigated the substrate scope based on (EtO)3SiH and HEH catalytic systems. As shown in Table 2 , when utilizing (EtO)3SiH as the reductant, electron-donating substituents on benzophenone, such as methyl and methoxy groups, can effectively yield the target compounds with good to high yields (2b and 2c). Electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine and chlorine can also smoothly yield the desired product with moderate yields (2d and 2e). Electron-donating substituents enhance the reactivity of benzophenone, making it more susceptible to reduction by (EtO)3SiH, thereby facilitating the formation of the target compounds in good yields. Moreover, the substrate 9H-xanthen-9-one (1f) can provide the corresponding product in a 40 % yield (2f). It is noteworthy that when using acetophenone (1g) with minimal steric hindrance as the substrate, the desired pinacol product 2g was not detected. Instead, the reduction product of acetophenone, 1-phenylethanol (3g), was obtained with a yield of 92 %. Similarly, when using HEH as the reductant, both electron-deficient substituents and electron-donating substituents can smoothly yield the target product in moderate to high yields (2a-2e, 52–95 %). The substrate 9H-xanthen-9-one (1f) can provide the corresponding product with a 50 % yield, the yield obtained under (EtO)3SiH conditions. Additionally, acetophenone (1g) also yielded 1-phenylethanol (3g) in a 63 % yield, without producing the 2g product. It is pleasing to note that we also investigated the gram-scale reaction experiment in the presence of (EtO)3SiH, and obtained the desired pinacol product in 70 % yield (Scheme 2 , a). The trapping experiment utilizing TEMPO as a radical scavenger demonstrates that the reaction is a radical process (Scheme 2, b). Furthermore, we used 1,1-diphenylethylene instead of TEMPO in the reaction (Figure S3). After the reaction, the system was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the coupling product (5a) formed between the C-centered radical and diphenylethylene was detected, which confirms the existence of the C-centered radical. Based on the amount reported [50,63,68] and our trapping experiment, we have given a possible reaction mechanism (Scheme 2, c). First, the benzophenone radical anion is formed through a single electron transfer process in the presence of (EtO)3SiH and HEH. This anion is then protonated to form radical 4a. Subsequently, 2a is obtained through a radical coupling process. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have developed two practical processes for photoinduced pinacol coupling of carbon-carbon bonds. These processes occur under photocatalyst-free conditions and utilize either triethoxysilane or Hantzsch ester as the reductant. In the model reaction involving benzophenone coupling, the desired pinacol product was obtained in a high yield of 96 % under 370 nm LED light irradiation in the presence of triethoxysilane. Similarly, when Hantzsch ester served as the reductant and the reaction was irradiated with 423 nm LED light, the desired pinacol product was obtained in a yield of 95 %. Under optimized conditions, the substrate acetophenone was converted exclusively to the product 1-phenylethanol, with a high yield. This work presents two practical methods for synthesizing carbon-carbon coupling intermediates through pinacol coupling of benzophenone-type substrates, making these methodologies promising candidates for a diverse range of applications.

        "dc:description": "The photocatalytic reductive coupling of carbon-carbon bonds via pinacol coupling represents a significant transformation in organic synthesis chemistry. Several elegant studies have reported the use of metal or organic photocatalysts in this process, but these often lead to trace metal residues or involve intricate operational procedures. Herein, we report a photoinduced pinacol coupling of carbon-carbon bonds from ketones, achieved under photocatalyst-free conditions using triethoxysilane or Hantzsch ester as the reductant. In the model reaction employing benzophenone as substrate and triethoxysilane as the reductant, the corresponding pinacol product was obtained in 96 % yield under 370 nm LED light irradiation. Similarly, when Hantzsch ester served as the reductant, the pinacol product was obtained in 95 % yield under 423 nm LED light irradiation. The substrate scope demonstrated that six substrates yielded the corresponding products with yields ranging from 40 % to 96 %. Notably, when acetophenone, a substrate with minimal steric hindrance, was used under the established conditions, only 1-phenylethanol was produced. This work introduces two practical methods for the synthesis of carbon-carbon coupling intermediates through pinacol coupling of benzophenone-derived substrates, positioning these methodologies as promising candidates for various applications.",
