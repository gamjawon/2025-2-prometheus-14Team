For the advancement of sustainable energy systems, biomass holds the potential to become a primary energy source worldwide. Glucose is one of the most economical and abundant carbohydrates, which can be converted to more value-added chemical feedstock. Here, a series of tungsten oxide catalysts supported on γ-alumina with varying tungsten content were synthesized using the wet impregnation method, and applied on the glucose conversion. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were investigated through powder X-ray diffraction, N2 sorption, scanning electron microscopy, UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Pyridine-adsorption IR analysis was conducted to elucidate the acidic properties of the catalysts. As the loaded tungsten content increased, the concentration of Brønsted acid sites increased while the Lewis acid sites exhibited a decreasing trend. By controlling the acid concentration by the tungsten content, it was possible to adjust the optimal glucose conversion and the product selectivity in this cascade chemical reaction. When the tungsten content is too high, the Brønsted acid site is excessively present, and the resulting side reaction can be occurred. Here, we propose a catalyst design with appropriate acidity, which can obtain the target product with high yield. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Acid catalyst Al2O3 Biomass Glucose Tungsten oxide 1 Introduction The progress of human civilization has historically relied significantly on finite fossil carbon reserves, leading to adverse environmental consequences. Hence, an increasing focus is being placed on the exploration and advancement of renewable energy sources, such as primary biomass, hydropower, wind energy, and solar energy [1]. Biomass has the potential to become a major global primary energy source in the future, and bioenergy systems have the potential to significantly contribute not only to sustainable energy systems but also to sustainable development [2]. Among the various biomass resources, glucose has been extensively investigated by worldwide researchers because it is one of the most economical and abundant carbohydrates. Glucose can be converted to fructose by isomerization on Lewis acid sites and consecutively to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) by dehydration of fructose on Brønsted acid sites (Scheme 1 ) [3]. 5-HMF serves as a crucial platform chemical in biorefinery, given its significant potential for generating various valuable derivatives. For example, 5-HMF can undergo conversion into biofuels like 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and other furans. Notably, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran can be directly employed as a raw material in gasoline production [1]. On the other hand, during a series of glucose conversion, 5-HMF can undergoes repeated rehydration and dehydration processes in the presence of water, possibly further converting to by-products like levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) (Scheme 1) [4]. Humin is also a reactive intermediate usually formed from highly reactive fructose [5]. Thus, it is important to design the catalyst to suppress these side reactions and obtain the high yield of 5-HMF. Yang et al. reported a high 5-HMF yield with 56 % using sulfuric acid as a homogeneous catalyst. Even though the strong liquid-phase Brønsted acids typically resulted in a relatively high 5-HMF yield, the 5-HMF can also undesirably decompose into LA and humins [6]. Also, despite the high yield of 5-HMF, the attractiveness of using mineral acids has decreased as more stringent environmental standards have been implemented. Thus, solid acids featuring Brønsted and/or Lewis acid centers have emerged as viable alternatives [7]. Generally, the heterogeneous catalysts offer significant potential in biomass conversion due to their capacity to achieve rapid reaction rates and exceptional selectivity towards desired target products [8]. In numerous instances, tin-containing beta zeolite has been studied as a Lewis acid catalyst, which showed the high selectivity to fructose in glucose isomerization [9]. Zeolitic zincosilicate can also be applied as a Lewis acid catalyst, and the zincoaluminosilicates exhibited the control of product selectivity in glucose conversion, i.e., isomerization of glucose and continuous dehydration to 5-HMF over Lewis and Brønsted acid sites by controlling the framework Zn and Al contents, respectively [10]. On the other hand, the interaction between a catalytic metal component, such as tungsten oxide, and oxide supports (e.g., Al2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, TiO2, etc.) has the potential to significantly modify the structural and catalytic characteristics of the heterogeneous supported active component [11]. Songtawee et al. reported a catalytic system consisting of phosphate-modified TiO2 catalyst to achieve the high 5-HMF yield with ca. 72 % from glucose [12]. Lau et al. synthesized the silica-supported zinc oxide using an initial wet impregnation method, and reported the conversion of glucose to lactic acid. Using this catalyst, they achieved lactic acid yields of up to 39.2 % [13]. Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) is widely utilized as a Lewis acid catalyst as well as a catalytic support in numerous reactions due to its dual acidic-basic nature, high stability, and cost-effectiveness, attributed to its high surface area. Jang et al. explored the impact of the acid-base characteristics of alumina on the interaction between the metal and support, as well as on the formation of coke deposition in propane dehydrogenation [14]. On the other hand, catalysts comprising tungsten oxide-based mixed oxides are recognized for their involvement in acid-catalyzed reactions and their notable stability [8]. Ramu et al. reported the zirconia supported tungsten oxide catalysts with tungsten concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 25 wt.%, which were employed in the liquid-phase esterification of methanol and palmitic acid. When the loading amount of tungsten oxide was 5 wt.%, it exhibited almost 100 % conversion of palmitic acid [15]. In addition, the Al2O3 supported tungsten oxide catalyst (WO3/Al2O3) is composed of a tungsten oxide overlay on a high-surface-area alumina support. It is well known that for the WO3/Al2O3 catalysts, while the surface Lewis acid sites are predominant at low WO3 surface coverage, as the coverage increases to intermediate and high levels, the surface Brønsted acid sites become increasingly prevalent [16]. In our previous work, we reported the catalytic performance of WO3/Al2O3 catalysts in plastic pyrolysis. The acid catalytic properties of the catalysts were controlled depending on the WO3 content, and the catalytic results were predominantly affected accordingly [17]. Gao et al. developed a new nickel-tungsten co-doped carbon catalyst for hydrogenolysis of cellulose to ethylene glycol using glucose-based carbon as a support, and confirmed that the addition of W directly affected the acid content on the catalyst surface [18]. Additionally, the increased Brønsted acid site promoted the hydrolysis of cellulose, but inhibits the isomerization of glucose to fructose [19]. To the best of our knowledge, the glucose conversion over the WO3/Al2O3 catalysts has not been reported to date. In this study, a series of WO3/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the addition of tungsten to γ-Al2O3 support through the incipient-wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were denoted as x-W/A. By increasing the tungsten content, x (wt.%) from 1 to 75 wt.%, the physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated, and the glucose conversion reaction was discussed by the effect of the tungsten content on the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. Since the method of easily controlling the ratio of acid sites by adjusting the tungsten content can be used in various reactions that require both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, e.g., biomass-derived paraxylene synthesis, production of ethylene glycol from cellulose hydrogenolysis, etc. [19,20], this study can serve as a guideline for designing appropriate catalysts for various reactions. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of x-W/A catalysts with varying tungsten contents (x = 1 − 75 wt.%) were synthesized by employing the typical incipient-wetness impregnation method on γ-Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain, SA 6975) with an aqueous solution of (NH4)6H2W12O40⋅xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 66.5 %). Prior to the usage of γ-Al2O3, it was routinely pulverized using a mortar, sieved through a 300 μm sieve, and subjected to calcination at 500 ℃ for 6 h. The supported catalysts were dried at 110 ℃ in a convection oven overnight, and those were finally calcined at 500 ℃ for 15 h with a heating rate of 2 ℃ min–1 to obtain x-W/A catalysts. For comparison, bulk WO3 was also prepared by calcining the precursor at 500 ℃ for 15 h based on our previous study [17]. 2.2 Characterization of catalyst The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded using Cu-Kα radiation on the Panalytical Empyrean. N2 sorption isotherm was obtained using a TriStar II 2030 instrument (Micromeritics). The specific surface area of the catalyst was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, and the pore size distribution was determined from desorption isotherms using the Barret–Joyner–Hallender (BJH) method. Elemental analysis was conducted using a PerkinElmer OPTIMA 7300DV inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The catalyst morphology was acquired through field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN AMBER X), which was equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker XFlash 7) operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) analysis was conducted with a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–visible spectrophotometer. The UV absorption spectra were generated employing the Kubelka−Munk function. Raman spectroscopy measurement was conducted using LabRam Aramis (Horiba Jobin Yvon) to examine the crystalline structure of the catalyst under ambient conditions. The 514 nm Ar-ion laser was directed onto the catalyst powder as the excitation source through an objective lens (×50), and the laser power for spectral measurement was maintained below 10 mW. Raman spectra were recorded within the range of 200–1500 cm−1 with a resolution of 1.5 cm−1. The acidic strength of the catalysts was examined using a NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) technique (AutoChem II 2920, Micromeritics). For this analysis, 150 mg of each catalyst was placed in a quartz tube and pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h under a He flow (50 mL min–1) to remove impurities in the catalyst. NH3 adsorption was performed for 1 h at 110 °C by flowing NH3 gas (10 % in He, 50 mL min–1), and the physically adsorbed NH3 was removed by evacuating the catalyst samples at 110 °C under He flow (50 mL min–1). The amount of desorbed NH3 was recorded by increasing the temperature from 110 to 450 °C under He flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The acidic properties of the catalyst were further evaluated through pyridine-adsorption infrared spectroscopy (py-IR) utilizing a Shimadzu IR Tracer-100 FT-IR spectrometer. The IR measurement during pyridine adsorption-desorption was performed inside a customized IR cell with a ZnSe window on a self-supporting catalyst wafer of approximately 20–30 mg with a diameter of 1.3 cm activated under vacuum for 2 h at 550 °C. All spectral deconvolutions were performed using the curve-fitting function in Origin 9.0. 2.3 Glucose conversion Glucose conversion was conducted in a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave reactor with a volume of 23 mL. Each reactor contained 1 g of glucose, 10 g of solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7 %, Sigma-Aldrich) to deionized (DI) water in a mass ratio of 2:1), and 0.1 g of catalyst. Catalysis was carried out at 140 °C and 100 rpm for 1–24 h under autogenous pressure. After the specified reaction time, the autoclave was quenched to terminate the reaction, and the product was filtered using a syringe filter. A sample for analysis was prepared by diluting 0.7 g of the filtered product with DI water in a 100 mL volumetric flask. For the reusability test, the catalyst was recovered after the reaction, washed with DI water, dried, and calcined at 550 °C for 8 h to remove any organic substance present in the catalyst. It was then applied to the glucose conversion again following the same procedure as mentioned above. High-performance liquid chromatography (Youngin Chromass YL9100 plus) equipped with refractive index and UV (280 nm) detectors and an Agilent Hi-Plex H column (300 × 7.7 mm) was used for analysis. The 5 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution served as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min–1, maintained at a column temperature of 65 °C. The determination of glucose conversion and the yields of fructose and 5-HMF were carried out in the following manner. Glucose conversion ( % ) = ( moles of reacted glucose / initial moles of glucose ) × 100 Product yield ( % ) = ( moles of product / moles of reacted glucose ) × glucose conversion 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1a shows the powder XRD patterns for the x-W/A catalysts (x = 1 − 75 wt.%) prepared in this study. The structural characteristic peaks for the γ-Al2O3 support appeared in all the catalysts at 37.0, 40.2, 45.8, and 67.0°, corresponding to the (311), (222), (400), and (440) lattice planes, respectively [21]. As the tungsten content increased, the intensity of those peaks for γ-Al₂O₃ decreased, and this trend was clearly observed until the tungsten content reached 25 wt.%. By the way, when the tungsten content exceeded 37.5 wt.%, the characteristic peaks for the monoclinic WO3 phase were observed at 23.2, 23.7, 24.4, 26.6, 28.7, 33.3, 41.5, 53.4, 55.9, and 76.4° corresponding to the (002), (020), (200), (120), (112), (022), (222), (331), (142), and (160) lattice planes phase, respectively [22]. The 25-W/A catalyst exhibited both the diffraction peaks for γ-Al2O3 and WO3. These results indicate that when the tungsten content is low, tungsten oxide exists as an amorphous state and/or as highly dispersed small crystals on the alumina support, while as the tungsten content increases, it turns into higher crystalline WO3 and finally the formation of bulk WO3 phase. It thus appears that the tungsten oxide particles were successfully supported on the alumina support and formed a monolayer at a certain tungsten content. Figs. 1b and 1c show the N2 sorption isotherms for the x-W/A catalysts and the pore size distribution curves derived from them, respectively. The BET surface area, pore volumes, and average pore size of the catalysts are also summarized in Table 1 . All the x-W/A catalysts exhibited the type IV isotherms corresponding to the typical mesoporous character of γ-Al2O3 support. However, as the tungsten content increased, it gradually became closer to type I isotherm like that of the non-porous bulk WO3 [23–25]. In particular, the x-W/A catalysts showed the H1-type hysteresis loop, implying the presence of uniform pores and channels with ca. 11–12 nm in diameter as shown in Fig. 1c [26]. Notably, when the tungsten content was low, the surface area of the catalyst slightly increased compared to that of γ-Al2O3 due to the high dispersion of tungsten species. However, as the tungsten content gradually increased, the surface area and the pore volume tended to gradually decrease (Table 1), and those two mesoporous features completely disappeared in bulk WO3. This implies that tungsten oxo-species are formed and deposited inside the mesopores of the γ-Al2O3 support, gradually blocking the pore [22]. On the other hand, the average pore diameter remained almost constant, except for the catalysts with high tungsten contents. This indicates that the tungsten oxide particle is well distributed inside the pores rather than at the pore entrance. Figs. 2 and S1 show the SEM-EDS elemental mapping images of the x-W/A catalysts prepared in this study. Regardless of whether the tungsten content is low or high, the tungsten particles were well dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 support. However, when the loading tungsten content was higher than 25 wt.%, tungsten oxide particles grew and agglomerated, and coarser surface was observed. For example, when comparing the surfaces of 1-W/A and 75-W/A, a smooth surface was observed in 1-W/A, whereas the surface of 75-W/A was found to have a rough texture with large tungsten oxide particles. Although the tungsten content measured by EDS increased proportionally as the impregnated tungsten amount increased, the measured values were somewhat lower than the calculated ones in impregnation especially when the tungsten content was high (Table 1). By the way, the bulk ICP elemental analysis results of the catalysts with tungsten contents ranging from 1 to 12.5 wt.% revealed that the analyzed tungsten contents closely matched the intended values from the synthesis process (Table 1). This means that the inside of the mesopore contains relatively more tungsten compared to the external surface of alumina support, which also corresponds well to the decrease in surface areas and pore volumes and maintaining pore size for the high tungsten containing x-W/A catalysts as discussed above. To more precisely investigate the chemical states of tungsten oxide species supported on γ-Al2O3 support, UV-DRS and Raman spectroscopy analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 3a , while the γ-Al2O3 support showed no characteristic band, the x-W/A catalysts exhibited the strong UV absorption bands at around 200–300 nm, which became much stronger in proportion to the increase in tungsten content. This strong band can be roughly decomposed into two resolved peaks centered at around 205 and 250 nm, corresponding tungsten trioxide and octahedral polytungstate, respectively [27,28]. Notably, as the tungsten content increased, the relative proportion of octahedral polytungstate increased further (Table 2 ). On the other hand, much broader band was observed in the higher wavelength region for the bulk WO3, which may be mainly attributed to a crystalline WO3 [29]. These results agree well with the previously discussed powder XRD, N2 sorption, and SEM-EDS results. Like the UV-DRS spectrum of γ-Al2O3, no Raman active mode was observed in this support material (Fig. 3b). Thus, all the detected Raman bands in x-W/A catalysts should be only come from tungsten oxide species [30,31]. As shown in Fig. 3b, for the 1–25-W/A catalysts, the most distinctive peak was observed in the range of 950–1000 cm–1, which is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration mode of the W = O bond in tetrahedral monotungstate species dispersed on alumina surface [22,32,33]. Interestingly, as the tungsten content increased, the strong peak was slightly shifted to higher energy region. This peak shift indicates that the amorphous monotungstate gradually polymerizes into distorted octahedral polytungstate species, creating less hydrated tungsten species on the γ-Al2O3 surface [22,34,35]. On the other hand, when the tungsten content was more than 25 wt.%, the strong peak in the range of 950–1000 cm–1 gradually disappeared and some other Raman bands newly appeared at around 270, 715, and 805 cm–1, which can be assigned as W-O-W deformation, W-O bending, and W-O stretching modes of the octahedral coordinated crystalline WO3, respectively [36–39]. These results are also well correlated with the previously discussed characterization results including UV-DRS. Fig. 3c shows the py-IR spectra measured at 100 °C after pyridine adsorption on the catalysts at the same temperature, and the results are also summarized in Table 2. Py-IR is generally recognized as a valuable technique for identifying the Lewis and Brønsted acid properties of solid catalysts [40]. Two resolved IR peaks for the two distinct acid sites are observed at around 1450 and 1540 cm–1 corresponding to Lewis and Brønsted acid site, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, the γ-Al2O3 support only exhibited the strong IR peak for Lewis acid site, which is because coordinated unsaturated aluminum ions serve as Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface [41]. In addition, the bulk WO3 itself showed a weak Lewis acidity as well as a very weak Brønsted acid property. Interestingly, while the γ-Al2O3 showed almost no Brønsted site, this acid site was generated when tungsten oxide was added, and the proportion of Brønsted acid gradually increased with increasing tungsten loading while the concentration of Lewis acid site showed the opposite trend (Table 2). It is likely that the tungsten oxide species titrate the strongest Lewis acid site on γ-Al2O3, leading to the formation of Brønsted acid site [42]. Probably, the proton species coming from tungsten precursor may induce the formation of Brønsted acid sites during the impregnation procedure. This increase/decrease phenomenon continued up to 50-W/A catalyst and slowed down at 75-W/A, which is because the acid sites exposed on the surface of excessively formed crystalline bulk WO3 are reduced. These results clearly show that the two different acid properties of the alumina supported catalyst can be controlled by adjusting the tungsten content. However, even if the tungsten content is maximized, there is a limit to the generation of Brønsted acid site, and the relative proportion of Lewis acid was always higher for all the x-W/A catalysts prepared here (Table 2). Additionally, the strength of the acid sites of these catalysts was investigated through NH3-TPD (Fig. S2). All the x-W/A catalysts showed an asymmetric peak centered at around 200 °C. It means that there are no significant differences in acid strength between catalysts. The acid concentrations depended on the tungsten content, which agrees well with the py-IR results. This property can serve as an advantage when targeting subsequent products following the intermediate fructose in glucose conversion by promoting rapid conversion of fructose through many Lewis acid sites. To evaluate the bi-acidic properties of x-W/A catalysts according to the tungsten contents, the cascade reaction of isomerization of glucose to fructose and consecutive dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF was investigated. It is well known that separate catalytic activity occurs at Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in this series reaction (Scheme 1) [10]. Fig. 4 compares the catalytic results for the x-W/A catalysts, as well as the γ-Al2O3 support and bulk WO3 prepared in this study. In all the reaction results, the glucose conversion continuously increased as the reaction went on, and even in the absence of catalyst (no catalyst), the thermal conversion also proceeded. However, in any case, the catalytic conversion showed the better performance than the thermal conversion. The γ-Al2O3 and bulk WO3 also exhibited the catalytic activities, and especially the γ-Al2O3 support showed the comparable conversion to those observed in the prepared x-W/A catalysts. While these two mono-functional catalysts showed the high selectivity to fructose, those were relatively unable to achieve continuous conversion to 5-HMF. These results are due to the prominent Lewis acid property of these two mono-acidic catalysts. In addition, all the reactions exhibited the continuous decrease in fructose yield after the production at the initial reaction times, and accompanied by the increase in 5-HMF yield. This is the typical phenomenon in consecutive glucose conversion. Fig. 5 rearranges the catalytic data to better compare them with the changes in concentrations of the two different acid sites according to the tungsten content. In the 1 h of reaction results, there was no noticeable difference in catalytic activity depending on the acid properties of catalysts. For the x-W/A catalysts with a rapid increase in Brønsted acid concentration due to the large amount of tungsten content (x = 25–75 wt.%), their fructose yields rapidly decreased after 3 h of reaction, which indicates the faster conversion of fructose to 5-HMF, while the others showed such the highest fructose peak at much later, i.e., 6 or 12 h of reaction. It thus appears that a clear catalytic phenomenon was observed in glucose conversion by impregnation of tungsten on the γ-Al2O3 support. If the Brønsted acid site is abundant in x-W/A catalysts, the dehydration of fructose should be accelerated, and accordingly not only the 5-HMF yield but also the glucose conversion increases. As more fructose is converted to 5-HMF, glucose conversion also increases to maintain the equilibrium in this series reaction. Up to the reaction time of 12 h, the Brønsted acid site acted as a dominant factor in the dehydration process to 5-HMF. On the other hand, in the 24 h of reaction, even though the Brønsted acid concentrations were high for the catalysts with high tungsten contents (25–75 wt.%) and their glucose conversions reached to 100 %, their yields to 5-HMF tended to be low. This is probably due to the rehydration of 5-HMF to LA, FA, and/or organic polymers over the Brønsted acid site under the reaction conditions where water is present in the solvent (Scheme 1) [4]. As a result, up to 24 h of reaction, the 3-W/A catalyst with a relatively low concentration of Brønsted acid site exhibited the highest yield to 5-HMF. These results demonstrated that an appropriate balance between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites rather than their absolute values is crucial for optimizing the conversion of glucose to 5-HMF. To confirm the catalytic durability of 3-W/A catalyst, the reusability tests were performed up to three continuous repeat cycles, and the glucose conversion and the 5-HMF yield maintained the initial values within the error range (Fig. 6 ). In the reusability test, the used catalysts were recovered through filtration and then regenerated by calcination. During this process, catalyst loss occurred naturally, and the amounts of glucose and solvent were reduced in proportion to the amount of catalyst loss. Since the total volume of the mixture in the reactor slightly decreased, it is believed that the slight increase in conversion occurred because the mixture was subjected to varying autogenous pressure as the dead volume of the reactor increased. 4 Conclusions We investigated the catalytic properties of tungsten oxide supported on γ-alumina catalysts for the conversion of glucose to consecutive fructose and 5-HMF. Through a systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties of the catalysts, we aimed to understand the impact of tungsten content on the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, and accordingly their influence on the glucose conversion. The catalysts were successfully synthesized using the incipient-wetness impregnation method, and their structural features were examined by powder XRD, N2 sorption, SEM-EDS, and UV-DRS, which revealed that the tungsten oxide content significantly influenced the crystalline structure, surface area, and pore characteristics of the catalysts. Furthermore, the Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of tungsten species with various coordination states, and the py-IR data indicated that as the tungsten content increased, Brønsted acid sites became more prevalent, while Lewis acid sites showed the opposite trend. These observations suggest that the acid site distribution can be tailored by controlling the tungsten loading. The catalytic experiments for glucose conversion revealed the correlation among tungsten content, acid site distribution, and yields to fructose and 5-HMF. In this study, when the tungsten content was 3 wt.%, which resulted in relatively low amount of Brønsted acid site, it exhibited the highest 5-HMF yield. Since some side reactions, such as rehydration of 5-HMF to levulinic acid and formic acid, may occur depending on differences in reaction time and/or amount of acid sites, the precise control of acid properties is necessary to selectively achieve the target product. From the overall results, we can conclude that this research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of tungsten oxide-supported catalysts for biomass conversion, emphasizing the significance of acid site tailoring in achieving efficient and selective catalytic processes.

        "dc:description": "For the advancement of sustainable energy systems, biomass holds the potential to become a primary energy source worldwide. Glucose is one of the most economical and abundant carbohydrates, which can be converted to more value-added chemical feedstock. Here, a series of tungsten oxide catalysts supported on γ-alumina with varying tungsten content were synthesized using the wet impregnation method, and applied on the glucose conversion. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were investigated through powder X-ray diffraction, N2 sorption, scanning electron microscopy, UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Pyridine-adsorption IR analysis was conducted to elucidate the acidic properties of the catalysts. As the loaded tungsten content increased, the concentration of Brønsted acid sites increased while the Lewis acid sites exhibited a decreasing trend. By controlling the acid concentration by the tungsten content, it was possible to adjust the optimal glucose conversion and the product selectivity in this cascade chemical reaction. When the tungsten content is too high, the Brønsted acid site is excessively present, and the resulting side reaction can be occurred. Here, we propose a catalyst design with appropriate acidity, which can obtain the target product with high yield.",
