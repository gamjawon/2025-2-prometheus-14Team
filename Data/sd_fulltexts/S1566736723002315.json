The use of these energy needs the support of energy storage technology, so energy storage becomes one of the key issues in energy production [5–7]. Among all kinds of energy storage devices, supercapacitors have been developing rapidly as an excellent electrolyte capacitor [8,9]. From the point of view of power density and energy density, the supercapacitor combines the characteristics of traditional capacitor and battery, which can make up for the disadvantages of low energy density of double-layer capacitor and low power density of battery [10–12]. Nickel oxide/hydroxide has attracted great attention for ultrahigh theoretical capacitance features. However, its poor rate capability and low conductivity hinder its widespread application [13–15]. In our previous work [16], OER reaction under alkaline environment lead to the evolution process from NiFe@NiFeO to nickel‑iron hydroxide and achieved good OER performance. New we applied this method to nickel‑cobalt bimetallic systems. Surprisingly, we found that the nickel‑cobalt materials tested after OER own obvious pseudocapacitance characteristic. As a result, we put forward an OER-activing strategy to realize the hydride conversion of monodisperse magnetic NixCo(1-x) NPs for supercapacitors. Hydroxide conversion process of NixCo(1-x) NPs which retain the original characteristics of small particles, not only promote the electron transfer between cobalt nickel hydroxide and conductive substrate, but also expose more active sites. Are more likely to reduce the reaction energy barrier during the NiCo OH 2 ↔ NiCoOOH conversion reaction under alkaline charging condition. In many fields of electrocatalysis, conductive substrates has been widely used to make full use of the conductive advantages of conductive substrates and make up for the poor conductivity of transition metal oxides and hydroxides [11,17]. However, most of the research work only takes the conductive carrier as the inert substrate, but ignore the possible synergistic effect between the conductive substrate and the catalytic component [18–21]. In this work, NiCo NPs transferred into hydroxides with electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activating strategy, and an ideal supercapacitor charge-discharge performance achieved on the conductive material based on cobalt foam. In order to explore the possible differences between different conductive substrates, we compared and analyzed the influence of nickel foam and cobalt foam on the charge-discharge performance of NiCo NPs. The results show that the conductive substrate difference has a great influence on the performance of NiCo NPs, and there is a significant synergistic effect between NiCo NPs and the conductive substrate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of NixCo(1-x) NPs The NixCo(1-x) NPs were made by modifying a previously reported method, 20 mL DMF transferred into 50 mL three-necked flask, and heated at 90 °C in the oil bath for 1 h under N2 atmosphere. Then 200 mg NaBH4 dissolved into 4 mL DMF and injected into the above solution. 5 min later, 6 mL DMF dissolving x (x = 0,0.2,0.4…1) mmol Ni(acac)2 and (1-x) mmol Co(acac)2 which has been heated in oven at 70 °C for 10 min was injected into the above solution. Then kept it at 90 °C for 1 h. Separate the product and wash with ethanol by centrifugation (11,000 rpm for 8 min) for several times after the solution cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the product dispersed in 20 mL ethanol for later use. 4 mL of above solution dried at oven to calibrate the mass concentration. 2.2 Preparation of NixCo(1-x)/NF and NixCo(1-x)/CF Several piece of cobalt foam (CF) or nickel foam (NF) (1 cm × 1 cm × 1.5 mm) was ultrasonic treated in 3 M HCl for 30 min, following with ultrasonic treatment in ethanol for 30 min, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h. Mass loading of NixCo(1-x) was 2 mg/cm2, take a certain of ethanol solution of NixCo(1-x) NPs according to the mass concertation of the solution and dropped it onto the CF or NF with 1 cm × 1 cm area，then dried it for 20 min at 70 °C. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF-8 Derived Porous Carbon(ZPC) ZPC was synthesized based on the reported literature [22]. 37.5 mL methanol solution dissolving 1.107 g Zn(NO)3·6H2O was poured in to the 37.5 mL methanol solution dissolving 2.42 g 2-methanlimidazole and stirred for 2 h at 25 °C, the product was separated and washed with methanol by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 3 min) for three times. Dried the product at 70 °C for 4 h under air. The ZPC obtained by carbonizing ZIF-8 at 900 °C for 3 h under N2 gas flow. To prepare the anode material, 80 wt% ZPC, 10 wt% carbon black, and 10 wt% Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were mixed with a few drops of ethanol. The mixture was stirred and assembled on a piece of cobalt foam (1 × 1 cm2) and was dried at 60 °C for 4 h. 2.4 Structural characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) carried out on Hitachi HT7700 with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. High-resolution TEM operated at 200 kV FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on X'PertPRO with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.5418 Å). The Raman spectra were test on the Lab RAM ARAMIS with an Ar laser at a wavelength of 633 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was test on the Themo EscaLab 250Xi analyser with a monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES, Ni and Fe K-edge) performed in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, Beijing). 2.5 Electrochemical measurements Performance test of supercapacitor measured in a standard three-electrode system by a CHI 760E electrochemical station at 25 °C. platinum wire used as counter, Hg/HgO used as reference electrodes. OER activing process employed with 100 cycle of cyclic voltammetry (CV) (0-1 V) to activate the electrode before the supercapacitor performance test. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed at an open circuit voltage (OCV) in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The ECSA obtained from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) according to the slope obtained from plotting the current density at 0.025 V against the scan rate. The potential window was 0–0.05 V. The scan rate were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mV/s. The rate capability properties and cycling stability was measured with LAND CT2001A battery testing equipment. Mass specific capacitance (Cm, F/g) were calculated utilizing the following formulas: Cm = IΔt / mΔV where I represents the constant discharge current (A), Δt represents the discharge time (s), ΔV represents the potential window (V) and m represents the mass of the active electrode material (g) of the working electrode. 2.6 Density functional theory calculations DFT calculation with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code within GGA exchange correlation functional. A periodic approach, plane wave basis set (with cut-off set to 500 eV). Core electrons described with the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method. The optimized geometry contained a 3 × 3 unit cell array with 15 Å vacuum in the z direction. The first Brillouin zone sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh. The energy change convergence criterion was 10−5 eV and atomic positions were relaxed until the sum of the absolute force was <0.05 eV Å−1. Gibbs free energy changes calculated by the following equation: ∆ G = G MOOH + G H + + G e − − G M OH 2 3 Results and discussion The OER in-situ activated NixCo(1-x) NPs conversion to nickel‑cobalt hydroxide is illustrated in Fig. 1j. Likely monodisperse NixCo(1-x) NPs was first prepared by a modified hot-inject method. Then NixCo(1-x) NPs was loaded on cobalt foam conductive substrate and the transition to hydroxide occurs under the condition of current flow in alkaline environment. NixCo(1-x) nanoparticles were synthesized by NaBH4 reduction of nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2) and cobalt acetylacetonate (Co(acac)2) in N,N-Dimethylformamide solvent. As shown in the Fig. 1a-f, 5 nm monodisperse NiCo NPs with different atomic ratios successfully synthesized. We believe that the strong adsorption of DMF and nickel is the key factor for the formation of small particles in NixCo(1-x) NPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NixCo(1-x) NPs are shown in Fig. S1. The NixCo(1-x) NPs show a poor crystallinity with a broadened peak close to (111) peak of face centered cubic (fcc) Ni (JCPDS No. 04–0850) and (111) peak of face centered cubic (fcc) Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806). The morphology of NixCo(1-x) changes regularly with the change of the molar ratio of Ni/Co. Nanoparticles agglomeration occurs with the increase of the content of Co, and assembled into 60-100 nm nanosphere when x ≤ 0.2. Ni0.8Co0.2 as an example to obtain the structural and morphological details by HRTEM characterization (Fig. 1 g). Fig. 1 g clearly displays NiCo alloy with 0.215 nm lattice fringe spacing, slightly <0.217 nm on the Ni(002) plane, which was attributed to Co doping. Fig. 1 h represents the selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) of Ni0.8Co0.2, well indexed to the corresponding planes of Ni metal. EDS line scan (Fig. 1i) shows a uniform distribution of Ni and Co. At the same time, the surface oxygen content of Ni0.8Co0.2 is higher than the middle area, which is attribute to the surface oxide during the drying peocess. Originally, inspired by previous work [16], we test the oxygen evolution reaction performance of NixCo(1-x) coating on nickel foam. 100 cycle CV employed to activate the electrode. Take Ni0.8Co0.2/CF as an example (Fig. S2), the oxygen evolution reaction activity of Ni0.8Co0.2/CF gradually increases and tends to be stable during the activating process. The area of the redox peak increases gradually and the position of the peak is shifted which attribute to the evolution process for Ni0.8Co0.2/CF. And the CV results indicate that NixCo(1-x)/CF show poor performance for OER. However, it was noted that in the CV curve obtained at the scanning rate of 2 mV/s, distinct redox peaks (a common property of nickel-based materials) could be observed. This makes it possible for the NixCo(1-x) to have an expected performance in the field of supercapacitors. At the same time, poor performance of OER can avoid the adverse reaction of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in the application of supercapacitors, so that the material has a relatively high voltage window, which is conducive to the improvement of the power density of supercapacitors. As a result, we put forward an OER-activing strategy to realize the hydride conversion of monodisperse magnetic NixCo(1-x) NPs for supercapacitors. To investigate the supercapacitors performance of OER activated NixCo(1-x) and possible effects of different conductive substrates, the ethanol solution of NixCo(1-x) NPs was coated on the nickel foam and cobalt foam (2 mg/cm2) respectively, and the supercapacity performance was investigated in 2 M KOH for OER activated NixCo(1-x)/CF and NixCo(1-x)/NF. Firstly, the NiCo NPs loaded on different conductive bases tested by cyclic voltammetry. Affected by the composition effect, NixCo(1-x) with different Ni/Co mole ratio shows a huge difference in pseudo capacitance performance. Ni0.8Co0.2/CF and Ni0.8Co0.2/NF shows larger closed area compared with others. The location of the redox peak shifted with Co doping. The increase of cobalt content caused the oxidation peak to shift to the negative direction of the X-axis and the reduction peak to shift to the positive direction. Meanwhile, NixCo(1-x)/CF and NixCo(1-x)/NF with same Co content also shows different behavior. NixCo(1-x) with high nickel content(x ≥ 0.6) have lager peak areas when coated on cobalt foam, with higher cobalt content(x ≤ 0.4) have lager peak areas when coated on nickel foam. It's worth noting that Ni0Co1/CF and Ni0Co1/NF shows distinct peaks, the redox peak of Ni0Co1/CF range from 0 to 0.2 V, the redox peak of Ni0Co1/NF appeared at 0.35 V and 0.43 V. Secondly, galvanostatic charge-discharge test was carried out to compare discharge specific capacity of NixCo(1-x)/CF and NixCo(1-x)/NF. As is shown in Fig. 2c-d, wide difference can be observed for NixCo(1-x) with distinct x but coated on the same substrate or for NixCo(1-x) with same x but coated on different substrate. NixCo(1-x) with high nickel content(x ≥ 0.6) have bigger discharge time when coated on cobalt foam, with higher cobalt content(x ≤ 0.4) have bigger discharge time when coated on nickel foam. It is worth mentioning that Ni0.8Co0.2/CF shows the best supercapacitor performance in the three-electrode system as 2124F/g. And the asymmetric supercapacitors with Ni0.8Co0.2/CF has 312.3 F/g performance (Fig. S7). The EIS measurement results is as shown in Fig. 2e-f. By NiCo composition effects, Impedance maps show a very regular process of change, the impedance of the all samples are around 0.4–0.6 Ω, suggests that the small particles of nano materials with relatively low resistance between the electrolyte. At the same time, the arc in the high frequency region shows the charge transfer impedance of the electrode related to the Faraday reaction. The smaller arc diameter relate to lower charge transfer impedance. Therefore, the increase of Co content can promote the charge transfer of NiCo materials. In the middle frequency region, when the included Angle between the curve and the X-axis is >45°, it indicates the rapid ion diffusion to the electrode. With the increase of Co content, the included Angle between the curve and the X-axis in the if region of the EIS curve is gradually approaching 45°, indicating that the increase of Co content can promote the diffusion rate of OH− to NiCo material or the absorption, stripping and embedding of OH−. In the low frequency region, the increase of Co content makes the slope of the low-frequency region of EIS curve approach infinity gradually. The curve of Ni0Co1/CF is almost perpendicular to the X-axis, and the Angle of 90° between the oblique line of the low-frequency region and the X-axis represents the ideal capacitive ion diffusion. Therefore, the increase of Co content is very conducive to the diffusion of capacitive ions. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled in 2 M KOH solution by using OER activated Ni0.8Co0.2/CF as the negative electrode and ZPC anode catalyst as the positive electrode to further demonstrate the potential application of the Ni0.8Co0.2/CF. Fig. 3a is asymmetric supercapacitor in 5–50 mv/s CV curve at 0–1.5 V. With the increase of the scanning rate, the area of CV curve gradually increases, indicating that the material has a good high current performance and that OH− has a good mass transfer rate in the negative electrode material. Fig. 3. b-c shows the GCD charge-discharge curve and multiplier performance curve of an asymmetric supercapacitor. The specific capacity of the device can reach 312.3 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. It can still maintain the specific capacity of 136.64 F/g at the current density of 8 A/g, confirming its good rate performance. EIS curves shows a low 2.25 Ω AC impedance, indicating the higher charge transfer of the electrode material. Fig. 3f shows the long-term cycle stability studies carried out by GCD test for the ASC device at 5 A g−1 over 3000 cycles and shows a capacitance retention of 70% compared to the initial capacitance, indicating well stability. To further investigate the evolution process of NixCo(1-x) NPs during OER activating procedure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and Raman spectrum was employed to illustrate the elemental composition and valence state changes of the NixCo(1-x). In the Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4a), peaks at 855.6, 873.6 eV, 856.9, 874.9 eV corresponding to 2p3/2, 2p1/2 of Ni2+ , and Ni3+, and the peak at 852.5 eV belong to Ni0. In the Co 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b), peaks at 781.7, 797.4 eV, 779.8, 795.7 eV are assigned to the 2p3/2, 2p1/2 of Co2+and Co3+, and the peak at 774.2 eV belong to Co0. For the Ni0.8Co0.2 sample before OER test, Ni0 and Co0 confirmed the existence of NiCo alloy, while the Ni2+, Ni3+, Co2+ and Co3+ should be attributed to the oxide on the surface of NiCo NPs. However, after OER test, Ni0 and Co0 disappear and Ni2+ and Co2+ content significantly increased, indicating that Ni0.8Co0.2 has been completely oxidized under electrocatalytic oxygen evolution condition. Same trend was also be verified by the XANES analysis of the NiK edge spectra and CoK edge spectra in Fig. 4c-d. The strength of NiK edge and CoK edge adsorption increases and cause an approximately 0.3 eV and 2.1 eV peak shifts to higher binding energy, confirming the increase of Ni3+ and Co2+ content. The O-L edge spectra in Fig. 4e shows significant transformation before and after OER test. A new peak attributed to the O species of NiCo(OH)2 at 535 eV appeared after OER test, further confirming the oxidation and phase transformation in the OER process. Raman characterization analysis was performed on Ni0.8Co0.2 before and after OER activation. As shown in Fig. 4f, Ni0.8Co0.2 is mainly in the form of zero-valent elements, so it hardly shows diffraction peak signal in Raman test. However, after OER activation, Ni0.8Co0.2 showed an obvious diffraction peak at 510 cm−1, which was corresponding to Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH phase, indicating that Ni0.8Co0.2 was likely to evolve into NiCo(OH)2 in the OER activation process. And XRD pattern (Fig. S5) show typical diffraction peaks at of the species. Based on all of the above characterization results, OER activation process lead to the evolution process from Ni0.8Co0.2 to Ni0.8Co0.2(OH)2. Besides experiments, DFT calculations were also performed to study the synergistic effect and support effect. As shown in Fig. 4g, the Gibbs free energy required for the transition of Ni(OH)2, NiCo(OH)2, and Co(OH)2 to NiOOH, NiCoOOH, and CoOOH were 6.572 eV, 6.385 eV, 6.313 eV. Co doping reduces the reaction barrier of NiCo(OH)2 to NiCoOOH. The Gibbs free energy required for OH near the Ni site to lose one H and OH near the Co site to lose one H were 6.856 eV and 6.432 eV, respectively (Fig. 4h). This suggests that Co(OH)2 may prioritize a shift to CoOOH. At the same time, the Gibbs free energy for the transition from Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH next to the Co site is only 6.667 eV. Therefore, the synergistic effect of Ni and Co and the support effect of cobalt foam are important reasons why NixCo(1-x) has good supercapacitor performance after OER activation. 4 Conclusions 5-6 nm hydrophilic NixCo(1-x) NPs was synthesized by a cost-effective and scalable method. An OER-activating strategy converts NixCo (1-x) NPs coated on conductive substrates into NixCo(1-x)(OH)2, resulting in excellent supercapacitor performance. Ni0.8Co0.2/CF exhibits optimal performance under the influence of synergistic and support effects. This work reports on excellent electrocatalysts for supercapacitors, and provides a novel idea to construct efficient electrocatalysts.
