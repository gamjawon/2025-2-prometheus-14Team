A clear relationship between the p-type conductivity, possibly concomitant with anionic conductivity, and catalytic performance was demonstrated, confirming previous hypotheses. Furthermore it was shown that the ability to activate surface oxygen paralleled these parameters. These results combined with the indications yielded by other experiments provided further insights in the nature of sites leading to the selective and unselective reaction.

Introduction Since the initial discovery by Keller and Bhasin [1], it is now well established that most of the selective OCM catalysts are composed of alkaline earth oxides, rare earth oxides or their mixture, usually promoted by alkali [2,3]. In early works, it was found that OCM catalysts generally present intrinsic properties such as surface basicity [3]. It was also observed that many OCM catalysts are p-type semi conductor under operating conditions [4]. In order to better understand the actual role of these intrinsic properties of OCM catalysts, a series of acceptor doped SrTiO3 catalysts was studied in OCM reaction and the correlation between the * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, another series of acceptor-doped CaTiO3 catalysts was studied and the role of oxygen species, surface basicity, semi-conductivity as well as the mechanism of methyl radical formation were investigated by means of electrical conductivity measurements, oxygen TPD, TP reaction with methane and CH4/CD4 equilibration in relation with the catalytic properties. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterisation Three types of catalysts were prepared by calcining a powder mixture of CaCO3, TiO2, MgO or Li2SO4 in the desired mole proportions at 1200 in air for 4 h: (i) undoped CaTiO3, (ii) CaTiO3 doped with 10 mol% Mg2+ and (iii) CaTiO3 doped with 10 mol% Li+. X-ray diffraction patterns of catalysts were obtained using a Phillips PWl710 diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode. The surface area was determined in a BET cell allowing in situ pretreat- ment under OCM reaction conditions. The chemical composition of the catalysts was analysed with ICP/5000 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. The surface composition of the catalyst was determined from XPS measurements obtained from a Perkin-Elmer PHI-550 spectrometer equipped with an A1 Ks X-ray source. 2.2. OCM reaction The OCM reaction was carried out with 1 g of catalyst at 800 in a quartz fixed- bed reactor (13 mm in diameter and 300 mm in length). The ratio of CH4 : 02 : He in the feed gas was 2 : 1 : 22 and the total flow rate was 30 ml/min. The products were analysed by on-line gas chromatography (FID and TCD). 2.3. Electrical conductivity measurements For electrical conductivity measurements the calcined catalyst was powdered and pressed into a disk of 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness, followed by sintering at 1200 for 6 h. The catalyst disc was mounted in a quartz vessel and connected with two Pt disc electrodes on each side. The conductivity dependence on oxygen partial pressure was measured in a mixture of N2 and 02 with various ratios. An yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) oxygen sensor was installed in the test chamber to monitor the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure. The conductivity of catalyst disc was measured under dc using a 8840 A multi- function meter. C.Y. Yu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 201-214 203 2.4. Temperature programmed desorption of oxygen 1 g of catalyst was pretreated in a quartz cell under oxygen gas flow at variable temperature for 1 h, then cooled down to room temperature and flushed with helium (33 ml/min) for 30 min. The flash TPD of 02 was then carried out introducing the quartz cell into a furnace preheated at 800, giving a non-linear but reproducible temperature profile. The off-gas was analysed by on-line mass spectrometry and the concentrations determined after fragmentation corrections. 2.5. Temperature programmed reaction with methane 1 g of catalyst was pretreated at 800 for 1 h under 02 or He (30 ml/min), then cooled down to room temperature and flushed with a mixture of CH4 (11.7 ml/min) and He (33 ml/min) for 30 min. The temperature programmed reaction with CH4 was then carried out raising rapidly the temperature up to 800 as described above. 2.6. CH4/CD4 equilibration The CH4/CD4 equilibration was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor loaded with 50 mg of catalyst in the temperature range 700-800 with a total flow rate of 34 ml/min (CH4 : CD4 : He=l : 0.9 : 12.8). Effluent gases were analysed by on-line GC/MS. The degree of equilibration (t~) was calculated from the normalised difference between the actual and the statistical isotopic distribution. 3. Results 3.1. Catalyst composition, crystalline structure and surface area The bulk and surface catalyst composition determined by chemical analysis and XPS, respectively, are reported in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1: 1. No significant change in composition was noted between surface (XPS) and bulk on the calcined catalyst and no changes occurred in the bulk composition after OCM reaction. 2. Some depletion into Li and Ti concentrations at the surface and/or in the bulk occurred during calcination. In addition, the Cls and Ols XPS spectra revealed that significant amounts of carbonate species were present on the catalyst surface, as expected from alkali- containing active OCM material [6]. The crystalline structure of the three catalysts was determined from their X-ray diffraction patterns. Undoped CaTiO3 presented main diffraction peaks with their 204 C.Y.

This corresponds to a perovskite of orthorhombic structure. Mg-doped and Li-doped CaTiO3 presented the same structure together with very small amounts of impurity phases such as MgO and Ca(OH)2 for the case of the Mg doped catalyst. This suggests that the Mg or Li additives at least partly incorporated into the perovskite matrix. The effective ionic radii of the various ions with a coordination number of 6, as expected for perovskite structure, are 60, 72, 76, 99 pm for Ti4+, Mg2+, Li+ and Ca2+, respectively [7]. From these values, it can be deduced that the substitution of Ti4+ by Li+ and Mg2+ is more likely than the substitution of Ca2+, since the ionic radii of Li and Mg ions are closer to Ti than to Ca ionic radii and too small to easily accommodate the A position in the ABO3 perovskite structure. Note that no measurable change in the perovskite lattice parameters was expected for such low amounts of additives. No observable change was observed in the crystalline structure of the three catalysts after O2-TPD experiments, indicating that all the catalysts were stable during oxygen adsorption and desorption processes. The values of catalyst surface area measured after OCM reaction are reported in Table 2. As can be seen, the addition of lithium tended to favour the sintering of the material, at variance with the addition of magnesium. Sintering effects induced by alkali via the formation of fused carbonates have long been reported in the literature [8].

OCM reaction The catalytic behaviour of undoped and doped CaTiO3 for OCM reaction is summarised in Fig. 1. The C2 selectivity and yields ranked according to the order LiCaTiO3>>MgCaTiO3>CaTiO3. Thus, Li-doped CaTiO3 exhibited the best cat- alytic behaviour for OCM reaction at 800 with a Ce selectivity and yield of 50.2% and 20.0%, respectively. 3.3. Electrical conductivity Fig. 2 reports the relationship between electrical conductivity and oxygen partial pressure for undoped and doped CaTiO3. It can be seen that over the present range of oxygen partial pressure, the electrical conductivity increased with oxygen partial pressure for each catalyst, indicating that all the catalysts were p-type semi-conductor under OCM reaction conditions [9,10]. It may be noted, however, that the slope of the plot log a/log PO2 is close to 1/8, which does not correspond to a simple model of cationic defect ionisation [9]. Therefore, another type of conductivity such as anionic conductivity could coexist with the electrical p-type conductivity, as mentioned for close substituted perovskite materials [ 11 ]. At every constant oxygen partial pressure, the conductivity ranked according to the order LiCaTiO3>>MgCaTiO3>CaTiO3 with a ratio of 5 : 1.25 : 1 for absolute value of conductivity. 206 C.Y.

Temperature programmed desorption of 02 Fig. 3 shows desorption spectra of O2 obtained from LiCaTiO3 as a function of the temperature of pretreatment under O2 flow for 1 h. For all cases, a single O2 desorption peak was observed. However, the intensity of this peak increased markedly when the pretreatment temperature was increased from 200 to 350. This also corresponded to a gradual shift of the peak maximum towards lower temperature. For higher pretreatment temperatures - from 350 to 800 - the intensity of the O2 desorption peak then decreased slightly and the peak maximum shifted again towards higher temperatures. A similar behaviour was observed for the MgCaTiO3 and CaTiO3 catalysts but with different oxygen uptakes and releases. Fig. 4 reports the amount of desorbing O2 as a function of pretreatment temperature for the three catalysts, calculated from the integrated TPD spectra. After oxygen pretreatment at 800, the amount of desorbing O2 was 20, 4.5 and 2.2 jamol for Li-doped, Mg-doped and undoped CaTiO3, respectively. 3.5.

The CH4 profile presented two main CH4 consumption zones, one at about 500, without carbonaceous product formation, and another one, more intense, after reaching 800 for 1 min, coinciding essentially with the release of CO2. Another weak consumption zone was observed around 800, coinciding with the produc- tion of C2H6 and C2H4. Similar profiles were obtained when the catalyst was pretreated under oxygen at 800 instead of helium. 3.6. CH4/CD4 equilibration Table 3 reports the results of CH4/CD4 equilibration over Li-doped and undoped CaTiO3.

In all cases, very low degrees of H/D exchange were found, even at high temperature. Over the 700-800 temperature range, some detrimental effect of oxygen could be noted on the degree of exchange. In addition, no significant difference was observed between Li-doped and undoped CaTiO3 at the same temperature. 4. Discussion Undoped CaTiO3 prepared by calcining original materials at 1200 formed a perovskite structure as clearly revealed by XRD. In Mg-doped CaTiO3, small amounts of MgO and Ca(OH)2 were observed in addition to the same perovskite structure. A slight increase in p-type conductivity was also observed after Mg addition (Fig. 2). Since MgO is known to be a n-type semi-conductor [9], this slight increase in p-type conductivity cannot be ascribed to surface MgO deposits. This would therefore more likely indicate some substitution for Ti of a part of the added Mg ions leading to the formation of CaTil_xMgxO3_~. This hypothesis, already proposed from relative ionic radii considerations, is consistent with the gradual increase of conductivity for the close Mg-doped SrTiO3 system after Mg addition from 10 to 40 mol% [12]. For Li-doped CaTiO3, no Li-based extra phase was detected by XRD spectrum besides the perovskite. No significant changes in surface composition was observed by XPS (Table 1). Note, however, that this does not rule out any surface enrichment with Li since XPS data also account for several subsurface layers. From these statements, it is therefore reasonable to consider that the large effect on electrical conductivity (Fig. 2) could be accounted for by assuming that a part of the added Li incorporated into the perovskite matrix producing CaTi~_xLixO3_6. Note that during the calcination step at 1200 allowing the above solid/solid reaction to proceed, a significant Li loss also occurred, most likely by evaporation 210 C.Y. Yu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 201-214 or reaction with the reaction vessel (about 41% loss from Table 2). However, non- significant Li loss was found to occur during the OCM reaction, probably due to the much lower operating temperature (800). The partial replacement of Ti by a heterovalent cation such as Mg and Li gives rise to the simultaneous formation of oxygen vacancies in order to maintain electroneutrality. This is illustrated by the following equations using Krrger-Vink notations [13]: (-TiO2) t! MgO --~ MgTi+Vo'+Oo (1) (-2TIO2) ~T. ttt Li20 ---+ ZL1Ti + 3Vo + Oo (2) Here Vo\" represent oxygen vacancies possessing two positive charges; Mg~i and Li~'i represent Ti lattice sites replaced by Mg and Li, respectively, the former with two negative charges, the latter with three; Oo represents lattice oxygen. Under oxygen atmosphere, oxygen vacancy will combine with oxygen to produce positive electron hole h+, leading to an increase in p-type semi-con- ductivity: Vo\" + 2 --~ Oo + 2h+ (3) Since p-type conductivity depends on the concentration of positive electron hole and its mobility, the conductivity can be written as Crp =-[h+]#pq (4) where ~tp is the hole mobility and q the absolute value of the electron charge. From the electrical conductivity data (Fig. 2), it can be seen that the p-type conductivity of Li-doped CaTiO3 is 4 and 5 times higher than that of Mg-doped and undoped CaTiO3, respectively. Let us assume that the measured electrical conductivity represents the bulk and not the surface behaviour since no significant difference was detected between surface and bulk composition (Table 1). Within the above assumption of a direct relationship between electrical conductivity changes and the Ti substitution by heterovalent ions, these values may correspond to the ratios of concentration of oxygen vacancies between the catalysts. By considering Eqs. (1) and (2) and assuming the same degree of substitution of Ti either by Mg or by Li, the concentration of oxygen vacancies for Li-doped CaTiO3 should be 1.5 times larger than for Mg-doped CaTiO3. Since the actual ratio is 4, as shown above, it may be deduced that the degree of Mg insertion in the perovskite matrix was almost 3 times lower than for Li addition. The hindered insertion of Mg ions is consistent with the formation of external MgO deposits while no Li20 deposits were observed after Li addition. A kind of cationic conductivity via mobile Li+ ions could also contribute to the high electrical conductivity after Li doping. C.Y. Yu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 201-214 211 Temperature programmed desorption of 02 could be considered as the reversible reaction of Eq. (3). In that sense, the increasing amounts of released oxygen as a function of the temperature of pretreatment (Fig. 4) reflect the activated character of the 02 dissociation. Note, however, that the capacity for oxygen uptake passes through a slight maximum at around 400, for which no clear explanation is available (possibly some surface pollution after oxygen activation at high tem- perature). Referring to the above discussion, it may be expected therefore that the amount of desorbing 02 at each corresponding pretreatment temperature should be proportional to the electrical conductivity. This is actually the case since the ratio of the amount of desorbing 02 for Li-doped and Mg-doped CaTiO3 pretreated at 800 is 4.4 : 1. These values are quite similar to the ratio of their conductivity (Figs. 2 and 4). Thus, it can be concluded that a direct relationship exists between (i) the capacity of oxygen uptake and desorption and (ii) the electrical conductivity. Another way to express the oxygen gas-phase-to-surface equilibria is to consider the different intermediate adspecies of oxygen, between gaseous and lattice oxygen [5,7,14,15]: Vo\" e:~ V~ + h+ (5) V'o + 02 02 (6) 02- + V'o ~ 02~ (7) O22- \"kS::}\" 20- (8) All non-fully reduced oxygen species, such as O-, O2or 022- have been proposed as possible \" active sites \" for abstracting hydrogen from methane molecule leading to the formation of methyl radical [4,6,14-16]. In this way, the strict parallelism between the ranking sequences observed for C2 yields (Fig. 1), for p-type electrical conductivity (Fig. 2) and for oxygen adsorption/desorption capacity (Fig. 4) strongly supports the above statement about active OCM species. Temperature-programmed reaction with ell4 led to complex profiles revealing several distinct zones of reaction (Fig. 5). The first zone of methane consumption around 500 did not correspond to any carbonaceous product formation (water and hydrogen were not analysed). It can therefore be assigned either to a non- dissociative chemisorption of methane, or to a reduction of a part of the Ti4+ ions with the formation of water and the deposition of carbon on the surface. A second but weaker zone of methane consumption around 800 corresponded to the selective formation of C2 products, with a reasonable carbon balance between the consumed CH4 and the formed C2's. This zone can therefore be ascribed to the selective OCM reaction occurring between methane and the above-mentioned oxygen adspecies. Note that this reaction occurred whatever the catalyst pretreat- ment (under 02 or He), indicating that these oxygen adspecies formed very easily (even from the traces of gaseous oxygen always present in He flow) and were stable enough not to desorb before the reaction temperature. The last zone of methane 212 C.Y. Yu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 201-214 consumption leading almost exclusively to COx was detected at the same tem- perature but obviously just after the completion of the selective process. Since the selective adspecies were consumed during the previous step, this non-selective process clearly corresponded to the reaction of methane with lattice oxygen of the mixed oxide. From a more quantitative point of view, the amount of consumed methane was estimated after integration of the consumption zone to about 8.9 ml/ gcat. Accounting for the stoichiometry of methane oxidation into CO2 and H20, this would correspond to the consumption of 1.58 mmol of lattice O, i.e. about 7% of the total lattice O. From the measured surface area (1.7 m2/g in Table 2), the O dispersion can roughly be estimated to 0.5% on the basis of oxide models described in [17]. This clearly demonstrates that not only surface but also bulk lattice oxygen anions could be reduced under methane flow at 800, which would correspond to about 14 atomic layers. This result reflects obviously the high redox potential of the titania-based catalysts. Note, however, that such a bulk redox potential cannot be considered as a prerequisite for high OCM performances since non-reducible catalysts such as lanthana were also shown to provide high C2 yields [17]. It can be thus concluded from these TP reactions with methane in the absence of oxygen that the selective route to C2 formation involved surface oxygen adspecies deriving from the activation of gaseous oxygen with surface vacancies, while the non-selective route involved essentially lattice oxygen anions. Close conclusions were obtained on a very distinct (since non-reducible) catalyst such as lanthana [17]. As far as the detailed mechanism of methyl radicals formation is concerned, two general points of view were expressed in the literature: (i) methyl radicals are formed directly from the reaction of gas phase methane with active oxygen surface species in an Eley-Rideal-type mechanism [5,14,17], (ii) gaseous methane first adsorbs heterolytically on the surface of the basic oxide, yielding H+ and CH3, and a subsequent abstraction of an electron from CH~- leads to methyl radicals [ 18-22]. CH4/CD4 isotopic equilibration can be used as a tool for studying the ability of a catalyst to heterolytically dissociate methane molecules as recently reviewed by Martin and Mirodatos in [6]. Our results about CH~CD4 isotopic equilibration showed an obvious lack of relationship between the degree of H/D isotopic exchange and the C2 yield. As a matter of fact, very low and similar degrees of exchange were achieved either for the performing Li-doped CaTiO3 or for the much less performing undoped CaTiO3 catalyst (Table 3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the catalysts presently studied obeyed much more likely to an Eley-Rideal-type mechanism for methyl radical formation. This statement agrees well with the specific role of the activated oxygen adspecies in the selective route to C2's, suggested in this work. The slight inhibition effect on CH4/CD4 equilibration observed in the presence of oxygen is also consistent with the hypothesis that the exchange does not proceed on activated oxygen but most likely on lattice oxygen via a heterolytic C-H bond cleavage [6]. In the presence of gaseous oxygen, the formation of activated O- C.Y Yu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 201-214 213 therefore competes with the heterolytic activation of methane. At very high temperature (850 as seen in Table 3), the expected decrease in O- coverage would explain a lesser effect of gaseous oxygen on methane exchange. 5. Conclusions This study has confirmed that a clear relationship existed between the C2 yield and the p-type conductivity, although other types of conductivity such as anionic or even cationic conductivity could also contribute to the observed phenomena, as clearly pointed out by Wolf in [23]. This effect was far more marked after Li addition, probably due to a favoured Ti substitution leading to a larger ionic vacancies concentration. This relationship can be explained in terms of a specific formation of selective oxygen adspecies on these ionic vacancies, able to react with gaseous methane to produce methyl radicals. The non-selective route leading to COx formation would rather involve lattice oxygen. A high redox potential was found for these titania-based catalysts. This intrinsic property did not, however, appear as a prerequisite for optimised OCM catalysts. Acknowledgements Thanks are due to CAS and CNRS for supporting part of this work, and to Dr J.M.

A series of Li- and Mg-doped CaTiO3 catalysts were studied and the role of oxygen species, surface basicity, semi-conductivity as well as the mechanism of methyl radical formation were investigated by means of electrical conductivity measurements, oxygen TPD, TP reaction with methane and CH4/CD4 equilibration in relation with the catalytic properties in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). A clear relationship between the p-type conductivity, possibly concomitant with anionic conductivity, and catalytic performance was demonstrated, confirming previous hypotheses. Furthermore it was shown that the ability to activate suface oxygen paralleled these parameters. These results combined with the indications yielded by other experiments provided further insights in the nature of sites leading to the selective and unselective reaction.
