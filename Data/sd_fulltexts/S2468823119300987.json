Graphical abstract La1-xCaxCoO3 perovskite catalysts were prepared by using citrate sol-gel method with the various calcium ratios (denoted as La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)). The prepared catalysts were poisoned with simulated gas including SO2 to investigate the sulfur resistance of the catalysts. The fresh and sulfur-aged catalysts were then applied to CO oxidation reaction. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the catalysts containing calcium also showed perovskite structure. La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 showed the highest CO oxidation activity among the Ca-substituted LaCoO3 catalysts. H2 temperature-programmed reduction indicated that the addition of Ca to LaCoO3 promotes the facile reduction of Co3+, which can explain the higher activity for CO oxidation. Surprisingly, small amounts of SO2 poisoning were observed to promote CO oxidation in Ca-substituted catalysts, although further exposure to SO2 gave rise to the decline of catalytic activity. In addition, Ca-substituted catalysts had higher catalytic activity than LaCoO3 after poisoning with small amounts of sulfur. XPS analysis indicated that Ca-substituted catalysts possessed the less amount of sulfate on the surface than LaCoO3 upon SO2 poisoning. It was summarized that La1-xCaxCoO3 perovskite catalysts had stronger resistance to sulfur poisoning and higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Keywords CO oxidation Sulfur resistance Perovskite Ca substituted LaCoO3 1 Introduction Diesel engine has been widely used for many years because of its various advantages such as high fuel efficiency and durability [1]. However, diesel engine emits harmful gases including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). Furthermore, as environmental regulation becomes more stringent, diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) which converts CO, HC to carbon dioxide (CO2) is required to have excellent catalytic activity and durability. Platinum group metals (PGMs) such as Pt, Pd and Rh are commonly used for DOC due to high catalytic oxidation activity [2,3]. Although PGMs have outstanding oxidizing ability, alternative materials have been searched to substitute PGMs because of their expensive and volatile price. Among many candidates, perovskite materials receive the attention as promising active catalyst since it has the remarkable activity in oxidizing CO, HC as well as the excellent thermal stability [4,5]. Perovskite type oxides which generally exist in the form of ABO3 containing lanthanides at the A site position and transition metals of first row at the B site position [6]. The element at the A site is responsible for the stability of the perovskite structure, although it is a catalytically inactive phase [7]. In addition, the replacement of the element of A site with other element can influence the valence state of B site element which is in charge of catalytic activity [8,9]. It has been reported that B site ion of perovskite with high valence gives rise to the increase in the mobility of lattice oxygen, resulting in the enhanced redox activity of catalyst [10]. One of the ways to change the oxidation state of B site ion to higher one is to substitute the one with lower valence into A site. When the A site ion is replaced by the ion with lower valence than normal one, the B site ion has higher valence to balance the overall oxidation state of catalyst [11]. Among various perovskite type oxides, LaCoO3 is known to be one of the most active catalysts in oxidation reaction, especially CO oxidation [12]. However, perovskite type catalysts have a critical problem, which is the facile poisoning of perovskite catalysts by sulfur included in the fuel or additives [13,14]. In the case of LaCoO3, sulfur compounds give rise to the collapse of perovskite structure by separating into lanthanum sulfate and cobalt oxide [15]. The destroyed structure cannot recover to its original perovskite structure, leading to the irreversible decrease in catalytic activity [15,16]. Partial substitution of A site ion with basic component is expected to prevent the sulfur poisoning of catalytically active B site ion because sulfur compounds are acidic. Accordingly, it is speculated that the addition of Ca which is basic and has lower valence than lanthanum would improve resistance to sulfur compounds and promote catalytic activity of LaCoO3. Merino et al. [8] reported the effect of Ca substitution in the LaCoO3 perovskite on various oxidation reactions, showing that the substitution of Ca generates oxygen vacancies, which leads to improve the catalytic activity in oxidation. However, the effect of Ca on sulfur resistance has not been reported yet. Hence, it is worth to investigate the behavior of sulfur resistance upon the substitution of Ca with the aim of developing the sulfur-resistant catalysts for CO oxidation. In this work, La1-xCaxCoO3 catalysts with various contents of calcium were prepared by using citrate sol-gel method. The prepared catalysts were tested for CO oxidation reaction. After exposing the catalysts to SO2 gas, sulfur-poisoned catalysts were also applied to the reaction. The effect of calcium contents and sulfur aging time of La1-xCaxCoO3 on the physicochemical properties and CO oxidation activities of the catalysts before and after sulfur poisoning were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation La1-xCaxCoO3 catalysts with various contents of calcium were prepared by using citrate sol-gel method. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.0%) and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Junsei, 98.0%) were dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water so that the sum of mole was 0.2. The molar ratio of La to Ca was changed from 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3 to 6:4. After stirring the solution, 0.2 mol of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Junsei, 98.0%) and excess citric acid anhydrous (Samchun, 99.5%) were added into the solution in the order named. When all precursors were fully dissolved, the solution was heated at 100 °C while stirring until it started to be viscous. Then the solution was dried at 120 °C for 6 h in an oven. The obtained purple powder was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h. The prepared catalysts were denoted as La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4). The obtained catalysts were poisoned with SO2 containing gas. 0.3 g of catalyst was exposed to gas composing of SO2 (20 ppm), O2 (9.5%) and N2 (balance) with a flow rate of 200 ml/min at 300 °C for 1 h. These aged catalysts were denoted as S-La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4). Especially, S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 was poisoned for 2 h and 4 h to investigate the effect of sulfur aging time. These catalysts were denoted as S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_xh (x = 2, 4) 2.2 Catalytic activity test Fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate CO oxidation. 0.05 g of catalyst was mixed with 0.3 g of silicon carbide (Sigma-Aldrich) to dissipate heat during the reaction. The composition of feed gas was CO (1000 ppm), O2 (9.5%), and N2 (balance). Total gas flow rate was 200 ml/min. The temperature was raised from 50 °C to 250 °C with the heating rate of 2 °C /min. Airwell +7 GHG gas analyzer (KINSCO) was used to measure CO gas concentration. 2.3 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was taken in a Rigaku SmartLab operating at 30 mA and 40 kV to analyze the crystalline phase of prepared catalysts. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 20 to 80°. H2 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts. 500 mg of each catalyst was located in a U-shaped quartz reactor which was heated from room temperature to 1000 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C /min. Reducing gas is composed of H2 (2 ml/min) and N2 (20 ml/min). TPR profiles of each catalyst were obtained from ACME 6500 gas chromatograph (Younglin) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a K-alpha (Thermo Scientific Inc., U. K) equipped with Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV). Binding energy of C 1 s at 284.6 eV was used as a reference. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of calcium ratio XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts with various ratios of La to Ca are displayed in Fig. 1 . The peaks at 23.3°, 32.9°, 33.3°, 40.8°, 47.4° and 59.1° of LaCoO3 sample are well corresponding to rhombohedral LaCoO3 [17]. In addition, Ca-substituted LaCoO3 samples demonstrated the similar peaks. Note that the intensity of perovskite peak in the fresh samples decreased when the ratio of calcium was higher than 0.2. This implies that excessive introduction of calcium reduced the crystallinity of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the magnified peak around 33° of each fresh slightly shifted to higher angle with increasing the amount of calcium. Such shift can be explained by the fact that lanthanum ion was substituted by calcium ion which was smaller than lanthanum ion, leading to the lattice shrinkage [8]. In addition, when calcium was introduced into LaCoO3, the samples maintained perovskite structure, although there was a slight difference around 33° among the samples. The Ca-substituted samples showed a single peak corresponding to cubic structure, implying that the substitution of Ca induces the phase transition from rhombohedral to cubic structure [18]. These XRD result indicates that calcium ion was well substituted to the perovskite structure. The fresh catalysts were applied to the CO oxidation as presented in Fig. 2 . T50, where CO conversion reaches 50%, was used to evaluate the activity of catalyst. T50 of La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) samples are 178 °C, 170 °C, 162 °C, 185 °C and 200 °C, respectively, indicating that La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The catalytic activities of sulfur-aged catalysts for CO oxidation are displayed in Fig. 3 . Meanwhile, sulfur-aged catalysts showed different tendency from the fresh ones. T50 of S-La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were 202 °C, 165 °C, 158 °C, 168 °C and 167 °C, respectively. All Ca-substituted catalysts demonstrated the enhanced catalytic activity after sulfur aging, as evidenced by ΔT50 which indicated the difference between T50 of S-La1-xCaxCoO3 and La1-xCaxCoO3. Only S-LaCoO3 presented significant deactivation after sulfur aging as observed from the shift of T50 from 178 °C to 202 °C, which indicates that S-LaCoO3 was poisoned more severely than the Ca-substituted catalysts. T50 and ΔT50 of the fresh and sulfur-aged catalysts are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4 . XRD patterns of sulfur-aged catalysts are presented in Fig. 5 . Sulfur-aged catalysts showed similar diffraction patterns to those of fresh catalysts. The peaks arising from perovskite structure were maintained. Meanwhile, there were slight decreases in peak intensity over the sulfur-aged catalysts containing calcium although there was no peak originating from sulfate phase. This indicates that sulfur species existed at the surface of the catalysts or as highly dispersed sulfate phase below the detection limit of XRD. H2-TPR profiles of the fresh and sulfur-aged catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . In case of the fresh catalysts, there were two reduction peaks arising from the reduction of cobalt species. It has been known that the reduction of cobalt in LaCoO3 perovskite undergoes following two steps [19]. (1) LaCoO3 + 0.5H2 → LaCoO2.5 + 0.5H2O (2) LaCoO2.5 + H2 → 0.5La2O3 + Co° + H2O The reduction peak between 400 and 500 °C was assigned to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and the peak at around 600 °C was to that of Co2+ to Co°, respectively [20]. Sulfur-aged catalysts showed similar reduction behavior to fresh ones. However, there were differences in the reduction temperature of cobalt between LaCoO3 and other catalysts. In case of LaCoO3, Co3+ of the catalyst after sulfur aging was reduced at 443 °C although the fresh catalyst was at 420 °C. This indicates that the presence of sulfur species made reduction of Co3+ in LaCoO3 more difficult. On the other hand, Co3+ of the Ca-substituted catalysts was reduced at lower temperature when the catalysts were poisoned by sulfur. The reduction temperature of Co3+ for La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were 435 °C, 402 °C, 440 °C and 456 °C, respectively. In addition, the reduction temperature of Co3+ for S-La1-xCaxCoO3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were 410 °C, 392 °C, 410 °C and 410 °C, respectively. This implied that cobalt species in the sulfur-aged catalysts with calcium had higher reducibility than those in the fresh catalysts. Reduction temperature of Co3+ demonstrated similar trend to T50 of catalysts as shown in Fig. 7 . This figure shows that reducibility of cobalt is closely related to the activity of the catalyst. As mentioned, since cobalt in perovskite is known to be in charge of catalytic activity in the catalyst, it is reasonable that there is a proportional relationship between reduction temperature of cobalt and T50. The better the reducibility of cobalt, the better the reactivity of the catalyst. It is known that the reduction process with H2 involves the lattice oxygen of perovskite and causes the reduction of cobalt [21]. When cobalt is reduced, the lattice oxygen transfers to the surface which participates in the reaction. After the reduction of cobalt, the reduced cobalt is reoxidized by reacting with the gas phase oxygen. Therefore, it is understood that lattice oxygen plays an important role in the oxidation reaction [8,22]. In summary, the Ca-containing LaCoO3 catalysts maintained catalytic activity due to the improved reducibility of cobalt despite sulfur aging. 3.2 Effect of SO2 poisoning time Catalytic and physicochemical properties of La0.8Ca0.2CoO3, which was selected as the highest catalyst for CO oxidation, were investigated after poisoning the catalyst with SO2 up to 4 h. The XRD analysis of sulfur-aged La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 with various SO2 aging time was conducted (not be shown). All catalysts had perovskite structure, demonstrating that the catalysts maintained stable perovskite structure despite the exposure of SO2 containing gas for longer time. However, there was slight decrease in the intensity of peak with increasing sulfur aging time. This indicates that SO2 exposure leads to destroy the perovskite structure of the catalysts to some extent. Note that there was still no sulfate-related peak in the sulfur-aged catalysts regardless of the increasing time of SO2 exposure up to 4 h. Catalytic performance for La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 with various poisoning time are shown in Fig. 8 . As explained in the previous section, there was an enhanced catalytic activity for La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 after sulfur poisoning for 1 h. However, catalytic activity became deactivated when sulfur poisoning time was longer than 1 h. T50 of S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_2 h and S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_4 h were shifted to 167 °C and 175 °C, respectively, implying that the catalysts were gradually deactivated with further increasing sulfur poisoning time. Interestingly, the sulfur-aged La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_4 h catalyst still exhibited higher catalytic activity than S-LaCoO3 in spite of longer sulfur poisoning time. Hence, it can be evidently claimed that the substitution of calcium into LaCoO3 catalyst enhances sulfur resistance of catalyst. Fig. 9 shows TPR profiles of the sulfur-aged catalysts with various aging time. S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_2 h and S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3_4 h had also two reduction peaks of cobalt, as shown in Fig. 6. The peak at lower temperature and the one at higher temperature were attributed to the reduction of Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. The difference between aged catalysts with different aging time is the reduction temperature of Co3+. Comparing La0.8Ca0.2CoO3, S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 showed lower reduction temperature of Co3+. This indicates that S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 has better reducibility than La0.8Ca0.2CoO3. However, the reduction temperature of Co3+ gradually increased when the sulfur poisoning time exceeded one hour. The increase in the reduction temperature of cobalt was arising from the decrease in reducibility of the catalysts. This indicates that a little of sulfur helps cobalt to reduce more easily. However, the cobalt is reduced at higher temperature when the catalyst is poisoned with excess sulfur. This result was well correlated with catalytic activity (Fig. 3), indicating that decline of reducibility is directly related to the decline of catalytic activity. XPS analysis was conducted to observe the chemical state of catalysts on the surface. S 2p XP spectra for the sulfur-aged catalysts are presented in Fig. 10 . All sulfur-aged catalysts had the peak about 169 eV assigned to sulfate [23], implying that sulfur exists as sulfate on the surface. In case of S-LaCoO3, the intensity of peak was much higher than S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 which was poisoned for the same time (1 h). This result indicated that S-LaCoO3 was poisoned more severely by sulfur compounds than S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3. Such tendency was also observed in catalytic activity (Fig. 3). The catalytic activity of LaCoO3 drastically decreased after sulfur aging while that of La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 did not, implying that La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 has superior sulfur resistance to LaCoO3. It was reported that there is a competitive adsorption between SO2 and CO2 on the basic sites such as CaO [24,25]. Since the adsorption of CO2 leads to inhibit that of SO2, the incorporation of Ca which can adsorb CO2 due to its basicity enhances the sulfur resistance of the catalysts. S 2p XP spectra of S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 with different aging time is also shown in Fig. 10(b). The increase of peak intensity corresponding to sulfate is observed with increasing sulfur aging time, indicating that the amount of sulfate increases, which leads to the gradual decrease of CO oxidation. Sulfur atomic ratio of sulfur-aged catalysts obtained from XPS are presented in Table 2 . 4 Conclusion In this work, calcium-substituted LaCoO3 catalysts were prepared with different calcium ratios. The prepared catalysts were then applied to CO oxidation before and after sulfur aging. In case of the catalysts with different calcium ratios, XRD analyses showed that all catalysts had perovskite structure and the crystallinity decreased when the ratio of calcium was higher than 0.2. H2-TPR analyses of the fresh catalysts showed that Co3+ of La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 was reduced at the lowest temperature, indicating that La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 have enhanced reducibility of cobalt species. After exposing catalysts to SO2 gas for 1 h, the Ca-substituted catalysts maintained their reducibility and S-La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 still showed the highest reducibility. The effect of SO2 poisoning time was also investigated. XPS analyses showed that the catalysts contained the larger amount of sulfate species on the surface with increasing time of sulfur aging. It was found that the catalytic activity has strong relationship with the reducibility of the cobalt in catalyst, indicating that the reducibility of cobalt is a decisive factor for catalytic activity in CO oxidation. La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 showed the highest catalytic activity for the CO oxidation before and after sulfur aging. It was demonstrated that the introduction of calcium into LaCoO3 perovskite helped to enhance the CO oxidation ability and improve sulfur resistance.

La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 showed the highest CO oxidation activity among the Ca-substituted LaCoO3 catalysts. H2 temperature-programmed reduction indicated that the addition of Ca to LaCoO3 promotes the facile reduction of Co3+, which can explain the higher activity for CO oxidation. Surprisingly, small amounts of SO2 poisoning were observed to promote CO oxidation in Ca-substituted catalysts, although further exposure to SO2 gave rise to the decline of catalytic activity. In addition, Ca-substituted catalysts had higher catalytic activity than LaCoO3 after poisoning with small amounts of sulfur. XPS analysis indicated that Ca-substituted catalysts possessed the less amount of sulfate on the surface than LaCoO3 upon SO2 poisoning. It was summarized that La1-xCaxCoO3 perovskite catalysts had stronger resistance to sulfur poisoning and higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation.",
