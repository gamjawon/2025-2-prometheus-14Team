The high reactivity of the double bond makes cyclohexene very useful as an alkylating agent and a raw material for the production of cyclohexanone, which in turn is employed for the manufac- ture of various nylons. Unfortunately, in the usual hydrogenation of ben- zene, only cyclohexane is produced and it is not easy to obtain cyclohexene, for obvious reasons. The value of AG (298 K) for the conversion of benzene to cyclohexene ( 23 kJ moF1) is substantially smaller than that for the complete hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane ( 98 kJ moF1) [1]. Thus, there is a strong tendency for the reaction to proceed all the way to cyclohexane. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the search [2-9] for appropriate catalysts and reaction conditions has been continued. It has been found that cyclo- hexene is produced in 18 - 29% yields [5-7] when the partial hydrogenation of benzene is carried out at 443 - 473 K in aqueous solution under hydrogen pressures of 1 to 7 MPa by using ruthenium catalysts together with large amounts of additives such as sodium hydroxide [6], iron sulfate [6] and cobalt sulfate [7]. However, these additives cause corrosion of reactors and hasten the deactivation of catalysts under reaction conditions [6]. We report here the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene with new ruthenium catalysts which do not require any additives. Such catalysts were prepared by the following chemical mixing pro- cedure [10, 11]. Ruthenium trichloride was dissolved in ethylene glycol or pinacol. Metal alkoxide, for example tetraethyl orthosilicate or aluminum tri-s-butoxide, was added to the solution, and the solution was mixed at about 338 K for 3 h. Water was added to the homogeneous solution to hydrolyze various metal alkoxides formed during the mixing. The solution *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elseiver Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 248 became viscous and finally coagulated in gel, agar or jelly. The coagulum was dried under reduced pressure at about 373 K for 24 h and finely powdered. The powder was activated in a stream of hydrogen at 673 K for 8 h. The catalysts containing copper or cobalt together with ruthenium were also prepared in the above manner by dissolving the respective chlorides in the same diol solution. The hydrogenation was carried out in a mixture of benzene and water at 453 K under a total pressure of 7 MPa. The reaction was followed by removing small samples at periodic intervals and analyzing the hydrocarbon phase. Table 1 shows the highest cyclohexene yields and the concomitant benzene conversions observed in the reactions with different ruthenium catalysts. The chemically mixed catalysts are much more effective for cyclo- hexene formation than the impregnated catalysts if the hydrogenation is performed without additives (compare Run 1 with Run 8, or Run 6 with Run 9). The existence of small amounts of cobalt or, in particular, copper in the chemically mixed catalysts makes the ruthenium catalysts more effective for cyclohexene formation (Runs 2 and 4). However, an increase of copper or cobalt content in the catalyst results in a decrease in the cyclo- hexene yield (Runs 3 and 5). On the other hand, in the impregnated catal- ysts, the coexistence of a large amount of cobalt sulfate in the reaction mixture is essential for the cyclohexene yields to be comparable with those in the chemically mixed catalysts (Run 10). When the hydrogenation with the chemically mixed catalysts was carried out by the addition of a large amount of cobalt sulfate into the mixed solution of benzene and water, no positive effects on the cyclohexene formation were observed. Thus, remarkable dif- TABLE1 Partial hydrogenation of benzene with different ruthenium catalysts\" Run Preparation procedure Catalyst composition Cyclohexene Benzene No. yield \"' conversion (mol %) (%) 1 chemical mixing 2 wt.% Ru-SiO^ 27.0 86.8 2 chemical mixing 2 wt.% Ru-0.2wt.% Cu-SiO; 31.4 83.3 3 chemical mixing 2 wt.% Ru-0.5 wt.%Cu-Si02 5.4 11.2 4 chemical mixing 1 wt.% Ru-0.1 wt.% Co-SiO; 27.9 84.8 5 chemical mixing 1 wt.% Ru-0.2 wt.% Co-SiOz 22.1 69.2 6 chemical mixing 2 wt.% Ru-AlaO^ 14.2 42.7 7 chemical mixing 2 wt.% Ru-0.2 wt.%Cu-Al2C 3 24.3 74.1 8 impregnation1' 2wt.%Ru-Si02 8.6 64.3 9 impregnation1' 2 wt.% Ru-A^Oa 5.3 54.5 10 impregnation1' 2 wt.% Ru-A^Oa c 27.2 72.7 \"Reaction conditions: benzene (160 cm3), water (100 cm3), catalyst (2 g), 453 K, reac- tion pressure 7 MPa. bThese catalysts were purchased from Nippon Engelhard, Ltd. c Together with this catalyst, 5 g of CoS04 was added in a mixture of benzene and water. 249 ferences are found between the properties of the chemically mixed and the impregnated ruthenium catalysts. Furthermore, the hydrogenation processes with the same chemically mixed catalyst (Run 2) were repeated three times by removing cyclohexane after the completion of the hydrogenation and adding fresh benzene. The cyclohexene yield in all three runs was about 30%, and deactivation of the catalyst was not observed. References 1 R. C. Reid, J. M. Prausnitz and T. K.
