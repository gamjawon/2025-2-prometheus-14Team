Hernadi, J. Halasz, K. Varga, I. Marsi and P. Fejes Applied Chemistry Department, J6sssef Attila University, H-6720 Szeged (Hungary) (Received December 12, 1989; revised June 6, 1990) Abstract Over Sn:Sb=3:l catalyst at 423-673 K the kinetics of oxidation and isomerization of 1-butene and cis- and trans-2-butene have been studied in a recirculatory batch reactor. The oxygen uptake of the catalysts was determined with a microbalance and kinetic parameters of oxidation were calculated. Comparison of the oxidation of the n-butenes demonstrates that both the conversion and the selectivity for butadiene are much lower in the reaction of both 2-butenes than in the oxidation of 1-butene. Since the double- bond isomerization (taking place over the Bronsted-type acidic sites of the catalyst) is a much slower reaction even at higher reaction temperatures, it was supposed that the only reaction step yielding butadiene is 1-butene-> butadiene on an oxidation site. Introduction The modem processes used for the production of butadiene are based on the dehydrogenation of C4-hydrocarbons. 1- and 2-butenes originating from cracking and pyrolysis are available in large amounts, and can be converted into butadiene with high selectivity at relatively low temperatures (623-723 K) in heterogeneous catalytic processes. Besides the well-known bismuth-molybdate [1, 2] and iron-antimonate [3, 4], tin-antimony mixed oxide catalysts were found recently to exhibit high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butenes. An exception is the Sn-Sb oxide system consisting of metal oxides without metal oxygen double bonds. They also differ from catalysts having free d orbitals. Herrmann et al. [5, 6] found no correlation between the electrical conductivity and selectivity to acrolein. SbgC^ and SbgO^ phases have no activity, but according to Vedrine et al. [7, 11] a solid solution of Sb6\"^ in SnOg could be responsible for the selectivity. Irving and Taylor [8,9] supposed weak Bronsted acid sites on the surface and carbonium ion-type mechanisms in all the reactions. Pyke et al. [10, 12, 13, 16] found that antimony-doped SnOg (rutile) crystals were extensively twinned in some regions. Butadiene selectivity depends on surface Sb concentration and they presumed an important role of an Sb centre surrounded by Sn ions. During surface acidity studies McAteer [14, 15] found evidence only for Lewis-type acid sites, and 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 362 the mechanism proposed by the author requires a specific acid-base surface centre. On the basis of Mossbauer measurements, Berry and co-workers [17-20] proposed an increase in s-electron density in both tin and antimony nuclei. In the catalytic oxidation of oleftns, reduction of Sb5\"^ to Sb3'1' (but still no Sn2\"1' formation) was observed. Mild calcination gives partially de- hydrated amorphous materials containing random arrays of Sn(IV), Sb(V) and Sb(III) species in approximately octahedral oxygen-hydroxyl environ- ments. At high temperature (1273 K), as a result of Sb migration, a rutile- type solid solution of Sb(V) in tin (IV) oxide forms and its surface is enriched in Sb(III). Smith and Berry [21, 22] found further evidence by using high- resolution electron microscopy. They observed a significant amount of amor- phous material after the catalytic reaction. A detailed kinetic study of the oxidation of n-butenes over Sn/Sb = 1/4 catalyst was published by Trimm and Gabbay [23]. They concluded that Sn44' ions played an important role, and that the abstraction of an allylic H was the initial step in the mechanism. Trifiro et al. [4, 24-27] found that the most easily reducible catalysts were also the most selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene. They suggest an oxidation mechanism in which the activated adsorbed oxygen has an insignificant role. Despite the commercial development of tin antimony mixed oxides as catalysts [28], surprisingly few details of the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butenes and relevant catalytic activity have been elucidated. Inconsistencies in the literature data observed and the industrial importance of butadiene provided the impetus for further investigation [29]. Experimental Pure antimony oxide was prepared by cone. HNOs from SbgOa. It was filtered off, washed and dried. In order to obtain pure SnOa, metallic tin was dissolved in cone. HC1. The solution was neutralized with NH40H, the precipitate tin(IV) hydroxide filtered off, washed and dried at 393 K. Mixed oxides with different mass ratios were prepared by homogenizing pure oxide mixtures in an electric mill (Narva, G.D.R.). They were then calcined at 873 K for 6 h. In the present catalytic investigations, the 250 400 Ju,m fraction of the granules was employed. In oxidation reactions no difference was found between catalysts prepared by this method and by coprecipitation. The thermal behaviour of the catalysts was investigated by derivatography (Derivatograph-Q, MOM), and phase analysis was performed by the X-ray diffraction method (Dron-3, U.S.S.R.). The surface areas of the catalysts were determined with the BET-method via the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. For adsorption and oxygen uptake studies, a microbalance (Cahn Instruments, 2102 Cahn Electrobalance) built into a vacuum system was used. Preliminary catalytic investigations were carried out in a pulse reactor. A recirculatory batch reactor was used for detailed kinetic studies. The volume 363 of the reactor was ~ 250 cm3; 0.5 cm3 of sample was used for each GC analysis. The amount of the catalyst was 1.0 g. The initial mole ratio of the reactants (except for the determination of the reaction order) was n-butene: oxygen==1:1. Two GC-s (Chrom-4 and Chromatron GCHF 18.3) with packed columns (filled with dimethyl sulpholane adsorbed to 30% on Chromosorb W) served for the analysis of reactants and products. Results Investigations in pulse reactor In a pulse reactor, the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butenes over tin antimony mixed oxides first was investigated as a function of catalyst composition. The volumetric composition of the gas feed was 7% olefin, 18% oxygen and 75% nitrogen. In the oxidation of 1-butene (Fig. I/a), the conversion increases almost linearly as the tin content increases. Maximum selectivity for butadiene was attained at a tin content of 70-90%. The most important byproducts are 2-butenes and carbon oxides.

Selectivities to butadiene and 1-butene show maxima at about 50% tin content. In both cases, pure Sbgt^ shows almost total inactivity in selective oxidation and slight isomerization activity. However, almost no isomerization product was obtained over pure SnOg. Investigations in the recirculatory batch reactor On the basis of results obtained in the pulse reactor, the Sn:Sb=3:l mixed oxide was chosen for further investigation in a recirculatory batch reactor. To ensure reproducibility, the same catalyst was used repeatedly under isomerization and oxidation reaction circumstances. It was to be expected that the catalyst activity decreased after the first reaction. Figure 2 shows almost total inactivity of the catalyst without reoxidation. These facts reflected the need for a procedure of catalyst regeneration. It was found that reoxidation of the catalyst in 13 kPa oxygen for 1 h at 673 K is sufficient for reproducibility. Under these conditions, a detailed kinetic study was begun over the catalyst Sn:Sb=3:l in the temperature range 473-673 K. On comparing the reactivities of 1-butene and 2-butenes (Fig. 3), it was found that the oxidation of 1-butene is quite rapid at each reaction temperature. For a complete kinetic picture, partial orders and activation energies were determined for 1-butene, (raws-2-butene and cis-2-butene, respectively. In Table 1 apparent kinetic parameters are shown: 0.45 as a partial order for oxygen was found; partial orders for the initial butenes were ~1.0. Activation energies make it probable that 2-butenes undergo double-bond isomerization first. On the basis of our previous work [30] performed on tin vanadium mixed oxides and on the basis of literature data [9, 14], double-bond isomerization of n-butenes was also expected over this catalyst system. In isomerization reaction measurements, 3.3 kPa n-butene diluted with N3 was used. Surprisingly, instead of isomerization products an unexpectedly large amount of butadiene was detected, in particular at higher temperature (Fig. 4). These results suggest that surface acidic sites are not numerous but at the same time 1-butene yields butadiene, so lattice oxygen must have relatively high mobility. During the reproducibility studies, quite different behaviour of the fresh catalysts was observed. In the reactions over fresh catalysts more isomerization products, more oxygen-containing compounds and a much lower butadiene yield in the oxidation of 1-butene were found; and no catalyst reoxidation procedure was able to regenerate the original surface of the fresh catalyst. At the same time, it was found that the properties of the used and then regenerated catalysts are more favourable as regards butadiene formation. The amount of side-products was undetectable, almost no isomerization products were obtained, but the butadiene yield was significantly higher. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the butadiene yield from 1-butene is lower on fresh catalysts. Nevertheless, butadiene yields from 2-butenes (Figs. 6, 365 50 (a) 3,0.1 p/kPa 2.0-PP VV'^iri 0 50 (b) 3.&jp/kPa 0 (c) 50 0 1-B o t-2-B o c-2-B BD 673 K Sn:Sb=3:1 1-B/Ng == 25/125 100 150 t/inn 673 K Sn:Sb=3:1 t-2-B/N; ; 25/125 150 Mum 673 K Sn:Sb=3:1 c-2-B/N; = 25/125 150 t/iiw Fig. 3.

Since the amounts of isomerization products are considerably higher in the case of fresh catalyst, it can be supposed that its surface contains acidic sites in higher concentration, which promote double bond isomerization and may yield 1-butene as a 366 o 1-B D t-2-B o c-2-B BO 673 K SnSb=3:1 fresh 1-8/0; = 75/75 100 150 t/fw 673 K Sn:Sb=3;1 1-B/0,, = 75/75 050Kio150t/fnin (b) Fig. 5.

Kinetic curves in the oxidation of (r<ms-2-butene over fresh (a) and regenerated (b) catalyst surface. precursor of butadiene in the oxidation of 2-butenes. But these acidic sites are probably poisoned during the reactions with butenes (or other olefins). In order to obtain further evidence in the oxidation of 1-butene, a catalyst previously poisoned by pyridine was tested (Fig. 8). The kinetic curves obtained are very similar to those of 1-butene oxidation over regenerated catalyst surface, so that high butadiene yield and no double-bond isomerization were observed. Investigations with the microbalance The need to regenerate the catalysts in order to promote butadiene formation under isomerization circumstances, and to obtain fresh catalysts of different acidity, inspired us to investigate the oxygen uptake of the used catalysts and the adsorption of pyridine and acetic acid using a microbalance. Since the amount of sample which could be introduced was limited (about 0.4 g) and the surface areas of tin-antimony oxides were not too high, measurements were carried out close to the threshold of sensitivity of the equipment. As a consequence, data obtained by this method cannot be used for quantitative analysis, nevertheless qualitative interpretation of the data seems possible. From Table 2 it can be seen that oxygen uptake of the fresh and regenerated catalysts is insignificant. Oxygen uptake of the used catalysts 367 Fig. 7. Kinetic curves in the oxidation of cis-2-butene over fresh (a) and regenerated (b) catalyst surface. Fig. 8. Kinetic curves in the oxidation of 1-butene over a fresh catalyst previously poisoned with pyridine. for different compositions increases as the antimony content increases. This result is in good agreement with literature data which describe high mobility of oxygen in pure antimony oxide. Data obtained from pyridine and acetic acid adsorption measurements are very surprising. Values of weight-loss and oxygen uptake for both pyridine and acetic acid show marked similarity. It is probable that both react with the oxide in a redox reaction. (A similar effect was found in the literature [14, 15], but no importance was attached to a 'little' decomposition of adsorbents.) It is remarkable the oxygen uptake remains nearly the same after both reaction and adsorption of pyridine or acetic acid. Conclusions Summarizing these investigations and results, it can be concluded that in the oxidative dehydrogenation over tin antimony mixed oxides 1-butene can be converted into butadiene with high selectivity. From the low activity for 2-butenes, from the apparent kinetic parameters and parallel maxima of butadiene and 1-butene selectivities obtained from the pulse reactor, we presume that 1-butene must be a surface precursor in the 2-butene to butadiene reaction. \"u SK -a \" 3coN [>0 (0 CQ U 3 w S + a S g (^ 5 i ^1\"S'^ro ^ - t--& .5 to o A; Bl 'ftM 3C^ 11 1 1>-0 co .S 3 *c >> o< + a a a s CO U 1 Us\" .. i-~& -S to ]s ' .M ^ N [^0 x ? w u g a wVI ihS e ^ & .5 tO 1 A 2 U g <s .

On the other hand, the necessity for catalyst regeneration with oxygen, to further butadiene formation under isomerization conditions in the absence of gas phase oxygen and oxygen uptake by used catalysts, demonstrate the role and relatively high mobility of lattice oxygen. From the different behaviour of the fresh catalyst, the higher isomerization activity and the higher butadiene yield from 2-butenes the higher amount of side products and the results obtained over catalyst previously poisoned by pyridine, it can be concluded that fresh catalyst surface contains more Bronsted-type acidic sites which are poisoned during the oxidative dehy- drogenation reaction. The experimental results obtained so far suggest a mechanism in which the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butenes over tin antimony mixed oxides can be described by the following scheme: l-B(g) BO + H.,0 1 COy, CO, ox. where B = butene, BD = butadiene, S = surface acidic site, R = surface centre, V=vacancy. The 2 V+ Oa -* 2 R reaction step describes the reoxidation of the catalyst, the heavy arrows show the most favourable reaction route. 2-Butenes can also yield butadiene under suitable conditions, via 1-B-S surface species. Since the double-bond isomerization is a relatively slow reaction, butene isomers are not in equilibrium under these conditions. References 1 C. R. Adams, H. H. Voge, C. Z. Morgan and W. E.

        "dc:description": "Over Sn:Sb=3:l catalyst at 423–673 K the kinetics of oxidation and isomerization of 1-butene and cis- and trans-2-butene have been studied in a recirculatory batch reactor. The oxygen uptake of the catalysts was determined with a microbalance and kinetic parameters of oxidation were calculated. Comparison of the oxidation of the n-butenes demonstrates that both the conversion and the selectivity for butadiene are much lower in the reaction of both 2-butenes than in the oxidation of 1-butene. Since the double-bond isomerization (taking place over the Brönsted-type acidic sites of the catalyst) is a much slower reaction even at higher reaction temperatures, it was supposed that the only reaction step yielding butadiene is 1-butene→butadiene on an oxidation site.",
