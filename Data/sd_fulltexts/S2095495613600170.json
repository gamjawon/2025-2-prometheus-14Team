Tel: +7-383-3309770; Fax: +7-383-3308056 Catalytic properties of the metal-organic framework Cr-MIL-101 in solvent-free cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates using tetrabutylammonium bromide as co-catalyst have been explored under mild reaction conditions (8 bar CO2, 25 0C). Styrene and propylene carbonates were formed with high yields (95% and 82%, respectively). Catalytic performance of Cr-MIL-101 was compared with other MOFs: Fe-MIL-101, Zn-MOF-5 and HKUST-1. The catalytic properties of different quaternary ammonium bromides, Cr-MIL-101 as well as PW12/Cr-MIL-101 composite material have been assessed in oxidative carboxylation of styrene in the presence of both tert-butyl hydroperoxide and H2O2 as oxidants at 8–100 bar CO2 and 25–80 0C with selectivity to styrene carbonate up to 44% at 57% substrate conversion. Key words carbon dioxide cyclic carbonates cycloaddition heterogeneous catalysis metal-organic framework oxidative carboxylation quaternary ammonium salts 1. Introduction Carbon dioxide is one of the major green-house gases, which is produced from chemical and energy supply industries, power plants and transportation sector. CO2 is also an abundant, inexpensive, non-toxic and biorenewable C1 resource. Nowadays, chemical transformation of CO2 into valuable organic chemicals has attracted increasing attention from both environmental and resource utilization viewpoints. However, CO2 molecule is thermodynamically stable and low reactive, so substantial energy input, proper catalysts and optimum reaction conditions are necessary for its chemical activation and further successful conversion to different commercial products [1,2]. Selective cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides as well as oxidative carboxylation of olefins are potentially significant approaches for both chemical utilization of CO2 and production of cyclic organic carbonates. Cyclic carbonates provide an application as a raw material in the synthesis of polycarbonates and glycols as well as fuel additives, electrolyte solvents for lithium batteries, and substitutes for non-environmental organic solvents and toxic chemical reagents [3–5]. Most common methodology for the preparation of cyclic carbonates is based on the cycloaddition of CO2 to the corresponding epoxides. Currently, industry uses quaternary ammonium salts, e.g., tetraethylammonium bromide [6], or their solid forms [7] as catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. However, these processes require high pressure of CO2 (70–100 bar) and high reaction temperature (100–200 °C) that make them unfavorable from the viewpoints of energy consumption and safety. A lot of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been suggested for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates [8,9]. For homogeneous systems, catalysts are salen, porphyrin, phthalocyanine and other complexes of the main group and transition metals (Zn, Al, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Sn) [10–16], as well as quaternary ammonium salts [17], ionic liquids [18] and polyoxometalates [19]. Some of these complexes are effective at low pressure and temperature [11,12,14–16], but a complicated separation of the catalysts from the reaction product limits their application. Several solid catalysts have been explored for this reaction, e.g. metal oxides [20,21], immobilized complexes or ionic liquids [22–24] titanosilicates [25], and zeolites [26]. There are also few examples of the use of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely Zn-MOF-5 [27,28], Zn-ZIF-8 [29], Co-MOF-74 [30] and IRMOF-3 [31], in this reaction. In general, the majority of the reported catalytic systems requires high pressure and/or high temperature conditions. Therefore, the search for new catalysts and energy efficient processes remains to be a challenge. Direct synthesis of cyclic carbonates from corresponding olefins and CO2, so-called “oxidative carboxylation”, is more environmentally benign and an economical process because of the less expensive and easily available raw materials and avoidance of initial synthesis and separation of epoxides. Although the oxidative carboxylation of olefins has been known for over four decades [32], only a few catalytic systems have been reported so far [2]. Both homogeneous (rhodium salts) [33] and heterogeneous (metal oxides Nb2O5, MgO, Fe2O3, V2O5, etc.) [34] catalysts in combination with O2 and CO2 gave quite low (17%–20%) carbonate selectivity under harsh reaction conditions (120 °C, 5 bar O2, 45 bar CO2). The use of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as oxidant instead of O2 and ionic liquids as catalysts increases carbonate selectivity up to 36%, but still requires high CO2 pressure (20 bar) [35–37]. Metal-organic frameworks have attracted great attention of researches due to the practical interest in their application in separations, gas storage and heterogeneous catalysts [38–41]. MOFs possess a unique ensemble of properties, such as high surface area, crystalline open structures, tunable pore size and functionality. Furthermore, MOFs are able to adsorb large amounts of gases, including CO2 [42,43]. Until recently, a serious disadvantage of MOFs that limited their application in catalysis was low thermal and hydrolytic stability. Chromium terephthalate Cr-MIL-101 discovered by Férey and co-workers in 2005 is resistant to air, water, common solvents and has a fairly good thermal stability (up to 300 °C) [44]. This material has a rigid zeotype crystal structure consisting of quasi-spherical cages of two modes (2.9 and 3.4 nm). These features prompted us to investigate the catalytic potential of Cr-MIL-101 for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 to organic epoxides and oxidative carboxylation of olefins. In the present work, we report the catalytic study on the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and olefins. The cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides was performed in the presence of Cr-MIL-101 under mild solvent-free conditions, which are attractive from both economic and environmental viewpoints. The catalytic properties of Cr-MIL-101 were compared with other typical MOFs such as Fe-MIL-101, Zn-MOF-5 and HKUST-1. The oxidative carboxylation of olefins was studied using quaternary ammonium salts as catalyst and TBHP or hydrogen peroxide as oxidant under both high and low pressure/temperature conditions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts and materials Styrene oxide (SO) (97%), propylene oxide (PO) (99%), propylene carbonate (PC), TBHP (5.5 M solution in decane), tetrabutyl-, tetrahexyl- and tetraheptylammonium bromides (99%) were purchased from Aldrich. TBHP (70% aqueous solution) was purchased from Merck and urea hydrogen peroxide adduct was purchased from Fluka. Commercially available carbon dioxide with a purity of 98.8% was used without purification. The other reactants were obtained commercially and used as received. The metal-organic framework Cr-MIL-101 with the formula of Cr3F0.8(NO3)0.2(H2O)2O[(O2C)–C6H4–(CO2)]3nH2O (n≈25) was synthesized following a procedure similar to that described by Férey et al. [44]. Activation of Cr-MIL-101 was carried out by drying under vacuum at 150 °C for 5 h and then at 180 °C for 2 h. The specific surface area and pore volume of Cr-MIL-101 determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method were 3270 m2g−1 and 1.47 cm3g−1, respectively. The chromium content was 23 wt%. The other MOFs were synthesized according to the protocols reported earlier: Fe-MIL-101 [45], Zn-MOF-5 [46] and HKUST-1 [47]. PW12/MIL-101 material was prepared by sorption of [PW12O40]3– on Cr-MIL-101 from aqueous solution at room temperature according to Ref. [48]. 2.2. General procedure for coupling reaction of epoxides and CO2 under mild conditions Epoxide (18 mmol), Cr-MIL-101 (50 mg, 0.2 mmol Cr) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBABr) (0.3–0.6 mmol) were loaded into a 100 mL high pressure stainless steel reactor. CO2 was introduced into the autoclave and the pressure was adjusted to 8 bar. The mixture was stirred continuously while the pressure and temperature (25–80 °C) were kept constant during the reaction. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled in ice-water bath or liquid nitrogen (in the case of propylene oxide) and extra CO2 was vented slowly. The reaction products were identified by GC-MS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A sample was taken from the reaction mixture, dissolved in CH2Cl2 and analyzed by GC after addition of internal standard (biphenyl) to determine the conversion of styrene oxide or propylene oxide and the yield of the corresponding carbonates. 2.3. Study on catalyst recycling behavior and stability in coupling reaction of epoxides and CO2 After catalytic run, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2, and the catalyst was separated by filtration and washed with CH2Cl2 and acetone. Then it was additionally treated with DMF at 60 °C for 3 h, filtered off, washed, dried in air at room temperature and then reused with fresh Bu4NBr added into the system. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and N2 adsorption measurements before and after several reuse procedures. The nature of catalysis (true heterogeneous versus homogeneous) was studied according to the methodology suggested by Sheldon et al. [49]. The content of chromium in carbonate product was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 2.4. General procedures for oxidative carboxylation of styrene 2.4.1. Harsh reaction conditions A batch reactor was charged with styrene (48 mmol), quaternary ammonium bromide (5.6 mmol), TBHP (70% aqueous solution, 71 mmol) and dodecane (1.5 mmol, internal standard for GC) and then pressurized with CO2 up to 100 bar. All the experiments were carried out at constant temperature of 80 °C. After reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and CO2 was released (∼1.5 h), then benzene was added into the reactor using a syringe pump. After washing the reactor's walls, the solution of the reaction mixture was dumped into a vessel and analyzed by GC-MS. 2.4.2. Mild reaction conditions Styrene (0.2 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.02 mmol), TBHP (4.7 M solution in decane, 0.3 mmol), Cr-MIL-101 (5 mg, 0.01 mmol Cr, if any), biphenyl (6.5 mg, 0.04 mmol, internal standard for GC) and CH2Cl2 (2 mL) were added into a 100 mL high pressure stainless steel reactor. CO2 was introduced into the reactor and the pressure was adjusted to 8 bar. The mixture was stirred continuously while the pressure and temperature (25 °C) were kept constant during the reaction. The reaction products were identified by GC-MS and quantified by GC. 2.5. Instrumentation The experiments at high pressure were performed in the high-temperature batch reactor Autoclave Engineers with Hastelloy C-276 alloy as the reactor's wall material. The autoclave was equipped with mechanical agitator MagneDrive and two thermocouples. The experiments at low pressure were performed in a stainless steel autoclave reactor. GC analyses were performed using a modernized Tsvet-500 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). GC-MS analyses of organic products were carried out using Agilent 6890/MSD 5973 system (carrier gas He, 30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm capillary column HP-5). 1H NMR spectra of the reaction products were run on Avance III 500 Bruker. An analyzer SORBTOMETER-M was used for measuring nitrogen adsorption characteristics and textural properties (specific surface area and pore volume) within the partial pressure of gas-adsorbate from 0.05 to 0.25 (multi-point BET method). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a SCIMITAR FTS 2000 spectrometer. XRD measurements were performed on an X-ray diffractometer Shimadzu XRD 7000S using cupric radiation (Cu Kα = 1.5418 Å). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides We studied the catalytic performance of metal-organic framework Cr-MIL-101 in the cycloaddition of CO2 to organic epoxides using styrene oxide as model substrate under mild reaction conditions (8 bar, 25 °C). The main results are presented in Table 1 along with the corresponding blank experiments. In a blank experiment, the conversion of SO achieved only 9% after 24 h while the formation of styrene carbonate (SC) was not observed (Table 1, Entry 1). In the presence of Cr-MIL-101, the substrate conversion increased up to 19%–23% (Table 1, Entry 2) but SC yield remained negligible. The increase of the reaction temperature led to the increase of substrate conversion (97%) and SC yield (62%) in a reasonable reaction time (Table 1, Entry 3). Tetraalkylammonium halides are used as catalysts for the production of cyclic carbonates and as co-catalysts for the reactions of epoxides with CO2 under mild conditions [6,50]. Indeed, we found that the addition of TBABr as co-catalyst of Cr-MIL-101 was crucial for the selective formation of SC at high substrate conversion (Table 1, Entry 4). After 53 h, SC was obtained with the yield of 66% (92% selectivity) at 72% conversion. The two-fold increase of the amount of TBABr led to the completion of the reaction at shorter time (Table 1, Entry 5). In this case, the conversion of SO achieved 98% in 48 h with high yield of styrene carbonate (95%). The main identified side product was 1-phenylethylene glycol, formed with the yield of 3%–5%. Importantly, TBABr alone did not catalyze the formation of SC at room temperature (Table 1, Entry 6). We found no further increase in carbonate yield after filtration of the catalyst during the reaction that proved true heterogeneous nature of catalysis over Cr-MIL-101 (Figure 1 ). However, ICP analysis of the filtrate showed the presence of 30–50 ppm of Cr after the separation of the catalyst, but apparently these species of Cr were not responsible for the catalysis. Recycling behavior of Cr-MIL-101 in the reaction of SO with CO2 was studied in three consecutive runs (Figure 2 ). Both SO conversion and SC yield decreased gradually during the recycling procedures, although the catalyst was washed and activated in vacuum before reuse. XRD data revealed the destruction of crystalline framework of Cr-MIL-101 after the second run. The N2 adsorption measurements also showed the decrease of BET surface area of the catalyst from 3270 to 2310 m2·g−1 after the first use and to 860 m2·g−1 after the second one. The same tendency was observed for the pore volume, which reduced from 1.47 to 1.04 and to 0.35 cm3·g−1 after the first and second use, respectively. At the moment, the mechanism of catalyst destruction during the coupling reaction remains unclear. Catalytic system Cr-MIL-101/TBABr also catalyzed effectively cycloaddition of CO2 to PO to give propylene carbonate with the yield of 82% at 91% conversion (Table 2 , Entry1). We compared the catalytic performance of other typical MOFs such as Fe-MIL-101, Zn-MOF-5 and HKUST-1 with the behavior of Cr-MIL-101 in cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene and propylene oxides under the same reaction conditions. The data collected in Table 2 show that Fe-MIL-101 and Zn-MOF-5 were also active and highly selective in the reaction with CO2 (Table 2, Entries 2 and 3, respectively). However, Zn-MOF-5 appeared to be less active material in comparison with Cr- and Fe-containing catalysts. Earlier Kleist et al. [27] studied the properties of Zn-MOF-5 modified with NH2-groups using tetraethylammonium bromide as co-catalyst in the synthesis of propylene carbonate. They obtained carbonate with similar yield of 63% (compare with Table 2, Entry 3) under more harsh conditions (44 bar, 140 °C) but shorter time (3 h). On the other hand, HKUST-1 demonstrated very poor activity in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates (Table 2, Entry 4). 3.2. Oxidative carboxylation of olefins As it was mentioned above, quaternary ammonium salts promote the formation of cyclic carbonates [35,36,51]. Indeed, under resembling conditions (TBABr as catalyst, aqueous TBHP as oxidant, 80 °C and 100 bar CO2 versus 80 °C and 150 bar CO2 in Ref. [36]), we have got results similar to the previously published: styrene oxidative carboxylation occurred with 32% selectivity to SC (Table 3 , Entry 1). The main side product was benzaldehyde. Interestingly, avoidance of water (using TBHP solution in decane instead of aqueous solution) yielded in the improvement of carbonate selectivity up to 44% (Table 3, Entry 2). Increase of the length of carbon chain of quaternary ammonium bromide (tetrabutyl-, tetrahexyl- and tetraheptylammonium bromides) led to the growth of substrate conversion but decreased the carbonate selectivity (Table 3, Entries 1, 3 and 4). It is noteworthy that styrene carbonate also generated with good selectivity (33%) under mild conditions (room temperature, 8 bar CO2; Table 4 , Entry 1). Cr-MIL-101 is an efficient catalyst for cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides (vide supra) [52] and, moreover, for alkene oxidation with TBHP [52,53]. All this prompted us to assess catalytic properties of Cr-MIL-101 in oxidative carboxylation of styrene. Unfortunately, addition of Cr-MIL-101 to the reaction system favored the formation of side product benzaldehyde and reduced carbonate selectivity (Table 4, Entry 2). Using of Cr-MIL-101-supported polyoxotungstate [PW12O40]3–, which was shown earlier to be an efficient catalyst for alkene epoxidation with aqueous H2O2 [48], resulted in the increase of styrene epoxide selectivity, while carbonate selectivity was rather low (Table 2, Entry 3). One can suggest that the reaction is quite slow and more time is needed for carbonate formation, however SC selectivity after 48 h of reaction did not increase. 4. Conclusions Chromium terephthalate Cr-MIL-101 in the presence of TBABr as co-catalyst was effective in the coupling reaction of the styrene oxide with CO2 to produce cyclic carbonates with the yields up to 82%–95% under solvent-free mild conditions (8 bar CO2 and 25 °C). Catalyst filtration test proved that Cr-MIL-101 operates as a true heterogeneous catalyst. However, the catalytic activity tends to decrease after several catalyst recycles because of the loss of MIL-101 regular structure and pore blocking with the reaction products. Other metal-organic frameworks Fe-MIL-101 and Zn-MOF-5 were also effective catalysts in combination with TBABr, while HKUST-1 had a poor activity and selectivity in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. Quaternary ammonium bromides catalyze oxidative carboxylation of styrene in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant with 21%–44% selectivity to styrene carbonate under both harsh (100 bar CO2, 80 °C) and mild (8 bar CO2, 25 °C) reaction conditions. Addition of Cr-MIL-101 into the reaction system promotes the formation of side product, benzaldehyde, and reduces carbonate selectivity. Using PW12/Cr-MIL-101 composite catalyst and H2O2 as oxidant decreases the selectivity to benzaldehyde and increases the selectivity to styrene epoxide, while carbonate yield is quite low.
