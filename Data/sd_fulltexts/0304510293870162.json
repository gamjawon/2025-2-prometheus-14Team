V61ter Central Institute of Physical Chemistry, Rudower Chaussee 5-9, 0-1199 Berlin (Germany) (Received July 24,1992; accepted February 8, 1993 ) Abstract Carbon monoxide adsorption and hydrogenation over several alumina- and silica-supported Pd and Pd-Fe catalysts have been studied by IR spectroscopy. A higher ratio of linear to bridged CO species was observed with the Pd-Fe/A1203 samples. No methane formation was detected with the silica-supported catalysts. The Pd-Fe/A1203 catalysts exhibited lower methanation activity, lower rates of formation and decomposition of the formate species and lower stability and reactivity of the adsorbed carbon monoxide. A mechanism of methane formation is proposed by which the formate species that occur on the support interact with hydrogen supplied from the metal by spillover. Key words: carbon monoxide adsorption; carbon monoxide hydrogenation; IR spectroscopy; Pd catalysts; Pd-Fe catalysts Introduction In our previous studies we found that upon interaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen on alumina-supported palladium some of the surface intermediate species could be observed spectroscopically [ 1 ]. In addition, it was suggested that the first step of CO hydrogenation over palladium involves the formation of formyl (CHO) species which, in the presence of a carrier exposing strong Lewis acid sites, is spilt over away from the metal and is adsorbed on the support as formate (HCOO) species. One of the formate oxygen atoms originates from the alumina [ 1 ] (Scheme 1) .

This species is also formed on the metal and subsequently spilt over to the support. Vannice [2] has shown that alumina-supported palladium catalysts exhibit high methanation activity. Later Poutsma et al. [ 3 ] successfully prepared catalysts active for methanol synthesis by the deposition of palladium on silica supports. The effect of various silica supports on selectivity in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide has been studied by Fajula et al. [4 ] . They found that supports of high acidity (acidic gels) give rise to methane while high selectivity for methanol formation is achieved with a neutral support. Recently, Lietz et al. [5 ] investigated the formation of methanol on PdFe/Si02catalysts. They proposed that the occurrence of a PdxFe alloy might affect the nature of the adsorbed CO species and hence the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. By means of infrared (IR) spectroscopy we have attempted to gain complementary information about the reaction mechanism of carbon monoxide hydrogenation over supported monometallic Pd and bimetallic Pd-Fe catalysts. Experimental The following palladium- and iron-containing catalysts were studied (metal loading as wt.%): 5% Pd/Si02,5% Pd/A1203,5%Pd+1.25%Fe/AI203, 5% Pd+1.25% Fe/Si02, and 1.5% Fe/A1203. Each catalyst was prepared by the procedure reported in ref. 5. Aluminium oxide (P 110 C 1, BET area 90 m2/g), supplied by Degussa, was used for the alumina-supported catalysts. Self-supporting pellets (20-40 mg/cm2) for the IR study were prepared by pressing the powdered catalysts at a pressure of about 0.5 MPa. All experiments were carried out by means of apparatus described elsewhere [ 6 ] . The samples were carefully treated with hydrogen under flowing conditions (6 1/ h). This procedure involved a stepwise rise in temperature to 573 K for 2 h and further reduction at the indicated temperature for 1 h. Reduction was followed by evacuation at 573 K to 1 X 10-5 Torr (1 Torr=133.3 Pa) and cooling the samples down to room temperature. Then the dispersion of palladium was measured by CO chemisorption at Pro ;t~ 5 X 10-2 Torr, assuming CO: Pd~ ,f =1:1 [ 7 ] and neglecting the CO adsorption on iron at the pressure applied to these runs. The results are presented in Table 1. After the preliminary reduction and characterization of the catalysts, as well as after each experimental run, a routine procedure of cleaning the samples at 573 K was applied. The latter involved evacuation, oxidation for 10 min in oxygen or air (Po z 10 Torr), evacuation, and reduction in hydrogen flow for 30 min. All the catalytic measurements were carried out at atmospheric pressure. Carbon monoxide, Fluka (pure grade), was used without further treatment for both the chemisorption and hydrogenation experiments. Prior to use, G. Kadinov et al./J Mol.

Hydrogen was purified by passing through a Pd/C catalyst, 5A molecular sieve and liquid nitrogen trap. Gas mixtures were prepared by using Matheson flowmeters. IR spectra were recorded on Carl Zeiss UR-10 and Specord 75-IR infrared spectrophotometers. Whenever catalytic activities were compared through the IR band intensities of definite surface species, the latter were corrected for sample weight. Results Palladium dispersion of the studied catalysts was low (Table 1). The dispersion with the silica-supported monometallic catalyst was even lower. Introduction of iron gave rise to a further decrease in dispersion. This was more pronounced with the alumina-supported catalyst. IR spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed on the alumina-supported palladium and palladium-iron catalysts are presented in Fig.1. As far as Pd-Fe/ a 0 1700 1900 2100 b Fig.1.

Catal. 83 (1993)157-166 A1203 and Fe/A1203 are concerned, no bands attributable to CO species on a reduced iron surface and no changes of band position and shape of CO adsorbed on palladium could be detected. CO spectra acquired with the silica-supported mono- and bimetallic catalysts manifested nearly the same features. A common feature of the spectra of the bimetallic samples was the increased intensity of the band for linearly adsorbed CO with respect to the bridged bands (Fig. 1). Silica surfaces do not expose strong Lewis centres for trapping formyl species that are initially formed on the metal. In view of this, data on the reaction mechanism and selectivity of CO hydrogenation could be acquired by studying the formation and conversion of the formate species on alumina-supported catalysts. Figure 2 shows the spectrum of a Pd/A1203 catalyst, recorded in the 1300-1800 cm-1 range, after admission of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (CO: H2=1: 3) at 523 K for about an hour. The band observed at 1590 cm-1 is characteristic of formate species on the surface of alumina [ 1 ] . Figure 3 shows the formation of formates with time on stream. For this purpose a continuously recirculated mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (1: 3) was passed through the IR cell-flow reactor at 483 K. Then the variation of the absorption at 1590 cm-1, related to the most intense band in the spectrum of the formate species (see Fig. 2 ), was monitored. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the formation of formates took place considerably faster on Pd/A1203 than on Pd-Fe/A1203. Formate species was also formed on A1203 and Fe/A1203, however, the initial rates of formation over these samples were lower than the initial rates over the Pd/A1203 and Pd-Fe/A1203 catalysts, respectively. This means that the presence of palladium facilitated the formation of formates on the support through the spillover of formyl species (Scheme 1) .

Only strongly adsorbed formats species occurred on the surface during evacuation at room temperature. No effect of metal additives was detected in this case. However, heating in vacuum to 523 K demonstrated strong differences between the samples. Formatea on the alumina alone were very stable. The coverage of formats species decreased with time on both Pd/Al203 and Pd-Fe/ A1203, this fall being more pronounced with the former. No visible changes in the intensity of the 1590 cm-1 peak after evacuation at 523 K were observed. However, hydrogen treatment at 523 K caused a further decrease in formats coverage only with the metal-containing samples.

In these runs a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (1: 3 ) was passed for a few minutes at 523 K through the cell reactor under continuous recirculation. After that the cell was closed and the absorption at 1304 cm-' (gas-phase methane) with time was recorded. No methane formation was detected with A1203, Fe/A1203 and the silica-supported Pd, and PdFe samples. Methane formation on Pd/A1203 was much more significant than on the Pd-Fe/A1203 sample. G. Kadinov et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)157-166 163 Experiments were also performed to compare the stability and reactivity of carbon monoxide adsorbed on palladium in the alumina-supported monoand bimetallic catalysts. The thermal stability of the CO species was examined by means of desorption in argon flow whereas the reactivity was studied by hydrogen treatment. Laboratory work was carried out in the following way. A mixture of carbon monoxide and argon (1: 200) or carbon monoxide and hydrogen (1: 200) was passed through the cell at 523 K. After that, CO admission was stopped and the decrease in intensity of the CO bands at 2050 cm-1 (linear species) and 1925 cm-1 (twofold bridged species) with time was recorded. The fall of the CO concentration in the gas phase was monitored by the behaviour of the branch at 2175 cm-1. Figure 6 shows the variation of the ratio of absorbance to initial absorbance with time. Line A denotes the moment at which carbon monoxide disappeared from the gas phase. Clear differences in the stability of the CO species on Pd/A1203 and Pd-Fe/A1203 are apparent (----). As is seen, the CO coverage was more stable on the Pd/A1203 sample regardless of the CO adsorption mode. Further distinction was found during the hydrogen treatment ( ). In agreement with the data reported in Fig. 5, the results presented in Fig. 6 indicate that the CO species on the monometallic catalyst readily react with hydrogen whereas it is much more slowly hydrogenated on the bimetallic catalyst. Discussion The chemisorption measurements show that introduction of iron to Pd/ A1203 gives rise to a lower value of the exposed palladium surface. Meanwhile an increased ratio of linearly (L) to bridged (B) bonded CO species (COL/ COB) is observed (Fig. 1). In a recent study of CO adsorption onto aluminasupported polycrystalline palladium, it has been found that the integrated absorbance of the bridged species is much higher than that of the linearly,adsorbed molecules [ 7 ] . Evidently, the bimetallic sample exposes less adsorption sites for bridge bonding. Recent studies [5,8,9 ] have indicated that palladium promotes the reduction of iron in the bimetallic catalysts and alloying between them may occur. In this sense the variation of the COL/COB ratio can be associated with the formation of alloy particles of various surface composition. Unfortunately, data on the degree of alloying in bimetallic Pd-Fe, catalysts reduced below 673 K are not abundant in the literature. A slight expansion of the Pd lattice upon reduction of a few Pd-Fe catalysts at 573 K has been reported by Sokolakii et al. [ 10 ] . The same authors suggested the formation of bimetallic clusters. However, in contrast to the results of Fukushima et al. [ 11 ] , we did not observe bands due to carbon monoxide adsorbed on iron atoms in alloy particles. In view of this the results presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 cannot be unambiguously explained by the formation of a Pd-Fe alloy and the operation of the so called \"ensemble effect\". lO G. Kadinou et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)157-166 It has already been found that hydrogen treatment at temperatures as high as 673 K, even for a prolonged period of time, is not sufficient to cause complete reduction of iron in the Pd-Fe catalysts [ 5,9 ] . The experimental conditions applied to the catalysts in the present study were not favourable for a considerable reduction of iron [5 ], thus predominance of the Fe n+ state, i.e. the presence of iron oxide (s ), should be expected. Evidence for the existence of an oxide phase containing Fe\" and Fe\" ions on the periphery of alloy particles in Fe-M/Si02 catalysts (Fe: M=1:5, M=Ru, Rh, Pt and probably Pd) has been presented by Niemantaverdriet et al. [ 9 ] *. The fact that no methane was detected during the CO hydrogenation over the silica-supported catalysts leads us to propose that methane is not extensively formed on the metal component of the catalysts but rather through hydrogenation of the formate species on the alumina support. The following mechanism can be suggested, which complies with the lower activity of the Pd-Fe/A1203 catalyst for formate formation and methanation (Figs. 3 and 5, respectively). The first step of the CO hydrogenation process involves the formation of formyl species. During this step the reaction occurs under conditions that do not favour CO dissociative adsorption on the metal surface. If suitable sites are available, a concurrent process can take place, namely, stabilization of the formyl species on the support as formates. The presence of iron in the catalyst results in a decreased number of Lewis centres on the alumina and/or formation of one or more iron oxide phases in close proximity to palladium (or palladium alloy) particles which hinders spillover of formyl species. Evidence for such a mechanism is presented in Fig. 3d. The formation of formate species on the alumina support is strongly inhibited by the presence of iron. It can be suggested from the slope difference between the curves b and d in Fig. 3, that 1.5% of Fe is sufficient to block up most of the Lewis centres on the support in the absence of palladium. In the presence of Pd, however, the partial reduction of iron, probably accompanied by the formation of a Pd-Fe alloy, only slows the process of formate accumulation in spite of the same amount of Fe in the sample. In our previous study of carbon monoxide interaction with hydrogen on Pd/A1203 and A1203 under dynamic conditions in the 400-500 K range we proposed a reverse spillover of the formate species from alumina to palladium, where it decomposes into CO and H2 [ 1 ] . The results presented in Fig. 4 can be interpreted similarly. Heating under vacuum caused a considerable decrease in intensity of the 1590 cm-1 band with the metal loaded samples, while the formate species was very stable on the surface of pure alumina under the same conditions. In presence of Pd (or Pd-Fe alloy) particles the formate species that occurs on the alumina surface of the catalyst migrates to the metal where its decomposition and desorption as carbon monoxide and hydrogen is facili- *See also references cited in ref. 9. G. Kadinou et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)157-166 165 tated. Assuming total reversibility of the spillover process in the presence of vacant sites on the metal, the latter process is probably suppressed on the bimetallic sample during evacuation under heating (compare curve slopes in Figs. 4a and 4b ). The role of the metal particles and of the unoccupied metal sites for the formate decomposition on supported Pd catalysts has been confirmed by Zhirnyagin et al. [ 12 ] . They found that the activation energy of formate diffusion on the surface of Ti02 is very low (8-15 kJ/mol) and the rates of formate formation (from HCOOH) and formate decomposition on the metal are very close. The difference in slope between the curves a and b, in Fig. 4, during evacuation and heating to 523 K shows that the relative decrease in formate coverage on the support is smaller with the bimetallic sample. The same authors [ 12 ] claim that the degree of formate decomposition is dependent on the number of metal particles rather than the metal amount. The data presented in Fig. 4 are in agreement with those reported in ref. 12, in as much as the Pd dispersion of the bimetallic samples is lower (Table 1), i.e. a smaller number of metal particles is present. However, the slope difference between the curves a and b in Fig. 3 and the high formate coverage on the support of the bimetallic sample after a prolonged period of time conform better to the above statement for the formation of a phase of iron oxide (s) which decreases the rate of formyl migration from the metal to the alumina. Further, the stability of the band intensity with the metal loaded samples during evacuation at 523 K as well as the continuous decrease in intensity during hydrogen treatment at the same temperature implies a complementary role of the metal component in the conversion of the formate species. Namely, during hydrogen treatment the presence of palladium favours the adsorption of hydrogen on the metal itself and the spillover of hydrogen from the metal to the support where it is likely that the formate species is hydrogenated to methane. Similar behaviour (identical slopes) of the curves with Pd and Pd-Fe upon hydrogen treatment at 523 K indicates that the process of further hydrogenation of the formate species was not affected by the possible presence of an iron oxide phase i.e. hydrogen spillover was not suppressed. Lietz et al. [5 ] and Fukushima et al. [ 11 ] have found that the highest activity and selectivity to methanol of Pd-Fe/Si02 catalysts were manifested by Fe/Pd ratios of about 0.1. A significant drop of the catalytic activity has been observed for CO hydrogenation over Pd-Fe catalysts having Fe/Pd ratios greater than 0.3 [5,11,13]. It was also shown, that the increase in the Fe/Pd ratio causes a sharp decrease in the non-alloyed palladium content and a proportional increase in the content of the Pd-Fe alloy [ 5 ] . It is likely that as the optimum Fe/Pd ratio of 0.2 is surpassed, enhanced formation of a Pd-Fe alloy in the bimetallic catalyst accompanied by a decrease in the amount of unalloyed Pd is not favourable for methanol formation. Our results are in accordance with this assumption. The Fe/Pd ratio of our bimetallic samples exceeded 0.3, however, the procedure of reduction was 166 G. Kadinoo et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)157-166 not favourable for the formation of a Pd-Fe alloy to a measurable extent. A distinct decrease in methane formation (Fig. 5) as well as a lower stability and reactivity of the adsorbed CO (Fig. 6) with Pd-Fe/A1203 were observed in the present study. These results indicate that the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over the bimetallic sample was inhibited as far as the first step of the process is concerned. The diminished activity in formate formation on the support probably favours the selective hydrogenation to methanol rather than the deep hydrogenation to methane. It should be emphasized that the formyl species is also formed as an intermediate during methanol formation, however, the absence of acid centres on the support prevents the formation of formates and their subsequent hydrogenation to methane. Conclusions Experimental results showed that methane was not formed during carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Pd/ssi02. Methane formation on palladiumcontaining catalysts was considerably enhanced if a support, possessing strong acid centres, was employed. The formyl species, formed on the metal, was spilt over to the support and adsorbed on these centres as formate species. Further, the latter species was hydrogenated by hydrogen which is also supplied from the metal by spillover. Introduction of iron to the palladium catalysts suppressed formate formation on the support. The Pd-Fe bimetallic catalysts exhibited an increased proportion of linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide which can probably be related to their higher selectivity for methanol formation. References 1 A.

A higher ratio of linear to bridged CO species was observed with the PdFe/Al2O3 samples. No methane formation was detected with the silica-supported catalysts. The PdFe/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited lower methanation activity, lower rates of formation and decomposition of the formate species and lower stability and reactivity of the adsorbed carbon monoxide. A mechanism of methane formation is proposed by which the formate species that occur on the support interact with hydrogen supplied from the metal by spillover.
