CO and H2 are the major products. A significant amount of methyl formate is produced at low conversions and low reaction temperatures. Cu/ZnO based catalysts show high initial activity but quickly deactivate. This may be attributed to the dissolution of Zn into the Cu lattice. Without the component ZnO, other Cu based catalysts show good activity and better stability. Cr increases the stability of the Cu based catalysts but slightly reduces the selectivity to CO. The composition of Cr correlates with the yield of dimethyl ether. Among many other components evaluated, a small amount of Ba, Mn and Si oxides strongly promote the Cu based catalysts in methanol decomposition. Cu, Cr, Si, O and Ba or Mn constitute the components of the highly active multicomponent catalyst. Characterizations of the catalysts combined with the compositional study suggest that metallic Cu is the active species for methanol decomposition. Silica enhances the activity probably by increasing the dispersion of Cu. Keywords: Methanol; Decomposition; Dissociation; Cu; Cu/ZnO; Syngas; XRD 1. Introduction Decomposition of methanol to syngas has drawn keen interest recently because the application of the reaction is promising in several markets [ 1-4]. Neat methanol or methanol/gasoline blend has been thought to be a good alternative automobile * Corresponding author.

Cheng /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 13-30 fuel, although some drawbacks exist [ 5,6 ] such as lower combustion value per unit volume and difficulty in starting the engine for neat methanol fuel and tendency of phase separation for the methanol/gasoline blend. The decomposition of methanol to CO and H2 on board a vehicle would eliminate these problems and can provide a fuel that is cleaner and more efficient than undissociated methanol fuel and gasoline fuel [ 7,8 ]. This endothermic reaction can make use of engine exhaust heat to increase the heating value of the decomposed methanol. The decomposed meth- anol can also serve as a supplemental fuel for gas turbines at the peak demand of electricity [7] or simply provide a source of CO and/or H2 for chemical processes, fuel cells, or material processing. The activity and stability of the catalysts are important for the success of these applications. Previous studies on methanol decomposition have largely concentrated on mech- anistic and thermal desorption investigations [9-15]. ZnO or Cu/ZnO catalysts were often used because Cu/ZnO based catalysts are industrial methanol synthesis catalysts. Although Cu and Zn are important elements in methanol synthesis, the role of ZnO in methanol decomposition is still unclear. While some studies sug- gested a promoting effect of ZnO [ 16], others did not [ 17]. Dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate [ 18-22] and steam reforming of methanol [ 23-25 ] over some Cu based catalysts have been studied. However, reports on developing highly active methanol decomposition catalysts were quite limited despite of its importance. The high activity catalysts are particularly needed for the on-board vehicle application where the catalyst needs to be active even at low temperatures during cold start and the space of the engine compartment is limited. Although Cu/ Zn/Cr oxide is a commercial methanol synthesis catalyst, its performance in meth- anol decomposition reaction is poor as shown in this study in contrary to general belief. What causes the poor performance of the methanol synthesis catalyst in methanol decomposition? Starting from this multicomponent catalyst, what can we do to produce good methanol decomposition catalysts? Understandings of basic functions of each component and their interactions would aid in the development of the catalyst; and this is reported in this paper. Silica was shown to enhance the activity of Cu based methanol decomposition catalysts in this laboratory [ 1 ]. The effect of silica was also examined further in this paper. 2. Experimental Unless otherwise indicated, methanol dissociation catalysts were prepared according to the following procedure. Catalyst precursors were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of Cu(NOa)2.0.3H20, Cr (NO3)a.0.9H20, Mn(NO3)2, B a (NO3) 2 or Zn (NO3)2 0.6H20 or other nitrate salts, depending on the indicated catalyst component, to a vigorously stirred solution of Na2CO3. If Si was indicated as a component, a silica (Cabosil) was added to the Na2CO3 solution. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed well with water. The solid was slurried with W.-H. Cheng /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 13-30 15 acetone and dried on a rotary evaporator to give a granulated powder. Catalyst precursor particles in the 12 to 20 mesh size range were calcined in air at 300 for 3 h. The calcined catalyst was reduced in N2/Hz 95/5 at 250 for 3 h before use. The reaction was conducted in a 5/8 inch O.D. Inconel reactor. Typically, 1.8 g of catalyst was used. Methanol decomposition was conducted at 250 and 15 psig with 35 sccm anhydrous methanol (99.9%) feed. The above catalyst prepa- ration, pretreatment and reaction conditions will be referred as the standard ones. Unless otherwise indicated, the standard conditions were used. The reaction prod- ucts were analyzed by two gas chromatographs connected in series and equipped with thermal conductivity detectors. CO2, methanol, methyl formate, dimethyl ether, water and other products of high boiling temperatures were separated in the first GC column (80/100 Porapak T). Gaseous products such as CO, HE and methane were separated in the second column (SA molecular sieve). The conver- sion and selectivity are based on mole percent. The conversion of methanol under the standard reaction conditions was used as a measure to compare catalyst activity. The catalyst composition is expressed as the weight ratio of metals and Si. For example, Cu/Zn 30/70 means that the metal component of the catalyst contains 30 wt.-% Cu and 70 wt.-% Zn. The XRD study was conducted using a Rigaku 0-0 X-ray diffractometer. The powder XRD patterns were recorded using Cu Ka radiation and scanned at 0.0220)/step. 3. Results 3.1. Cu/ZnO based catalysts To understand how Cu/ZnO based catalysts perform in methanol decomposition reaction, Table 1 shows the conversion of methanol and product distribution over a Cu/Zn 30/70 catalyst after about 16 h of reaction. The calcined sample was loaded in the reactor and then reduced. The Cu/Zn catalyst is active at 200-300.

A significant amount of methyl- formate is produced at low temperatures and low conversions. The result suggests that methylformate is the primary product in the methanol decomposition at low temperatures. Methylformate could be further decomposed to methanol and CO at higher conversions. Production of methane increases with the reaction temperature. Small amounts of dimethyl ether and CO2 were also observed. Mass balance errors were generally less than 1%. The initial activity of many Cu/Zn based catalysts used in this study is high. However, they all quickly deactivate in the first few hours of reaction. Fig. 1 shows a typical activity curve as a function of time on stream, using a Cu/Cr/Zn 27/10/ 63 catalyst as an example. More than 70% conversion of methanol was obtained over the fresh catalyst. Although the surface area of the used catalyst does not decrease after the reduction treatment and the reaction, the conversion drops quickly in the first few hours of the reaction and reaches a nearly steady activity after about 16 hours. A careful examination of the product distribution revealed that excessive oxygen atoms were present in the products in the early time on stream.

The H to C was well balanced at all times. The imbalanced O to C would imply a reduction of the catalyst in the reaction. Unless otherwise indicated, the reactor data reported in this paper were obtained after 16 h of reaction. Similar observations were found for many other Cu/ZnO based catalysts. The study was thus directed to look for other Cu based catalysts without the ZnO component. 4. Cu based catalysts without ZnO A series of Cu containing catalysts without ZnO were studied for methanol decomposition. These may be written as Cu/Cr/M where M is one or more elements from the alkaline earth metals, Mn and Si. SiO2 supported Cu based catalysts were also studied. The product distribution is similar to that of the Cu/Zn based catalysts. However, the rapid decrease of the initial activity was not found when the com- ponent ZnO was absent. The catalyst preparation process and pretreatment conditions could affect the catalyst performance. The detail of the effect of the preparation process and pre- treatment conditions is outside the scope of this paper and will be given in other publications. Nonetheless, the methanol conversions at 250 over a series of Cu based catalysts with and without ZnO are given in Fig. 2 as an overview. A range of methanol conversion is indicated for each type of the catalysts because various compositions, pretreatments and preparation conditions were used. Catalyst syn- thesis factors which were studied include precipitation agents (e.g. carbonate, hydroxide, citrate routes), precipitation speed (e.g. slow, fast), addition of silica at different stages of preparation, calcination atmospheres and temperatures and composition of constituents, etc. However, the effect of these factors is small METHANOL DISSOCIATION CATALYSTS (I) With Zn Cu/Zn Cu/Zn/Cr Cu/Zn/Cr/Si Cu/Zn/Cr/Mn (11) No Zn Cu/Cr Cu/Cr/Mn Cu/Cr/Ba Cu/Cr/Si Cu/Cr/Mn/Si I H H 250 I I I I H I I _J I / I_ I __ I I P I 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Conversion (%) Fig. 2.

The Cu based catalysts without ZnO show much more stable initial activity and are therefore more active than those containing ZnO. Furthermore, Mn and alkaline earth metals such as Ba appear to promote the Cu based catalysts for methanol decomposition. A small amount of silica (typically a few percent) further enhances the activity. The effect of alkaline earth metals and silica on the catalyst activity was investigated further as shown below. Table 3 compares the activity and selectivity of a series of Cu/Cr/alkaline earth metals/Si and Cu/Cr/Si catalysts. The methanol conversion could not be related to the surface area. However, a few percent Ba discernibly increases the methanol conversion. The ratio of Cu to Cr did not significantly affect the catalyst activity. Mg, Ca and Sr did not appear to further promote the activity of the Cu/Cr/Si catalyst. Atomic number of the alkaline earth metals may influence their promoting effect. The promoting effect of silica of different concentrations in the Cu/Cr/Mn/ Si catalysts is shown in Fig. 3.

Based on the above study, the preferred components of high-activity catalysts are Cu, Cr, Ba (or Mn) and Si. Methanol decomposition was tested over a Cu/Cr/ Mn/Si catalyst for its productivity. The result is shown in Table 4 for methanol decomposition at 300 and 15 psig. 100% methanol conversion was obtained at 5.0 liq cm3 /h g catalyst of methanol throughput or less. The conversion maintained at a high level of 91.6% when the throughput increased to 8 liq cm3/h g catalyst. The selectivity to CO and H2 was about 93 and 97%, respectively. To study if Cu is the main active species for methanol decomposition. A silica supported Cu catalyst (Girdler T-1506 with about 12% Cu loading) was tested. The catalyst showed a reasonably good activity with 43% conversion of methanol under the standard reaction conditions at 250. A Zn/Cr catalyst (United G70) had an activity of only about 1% methanol conversion under the same condition. 5. Catalyst selectivity The product distribution of methanol decomposition over a Cu/Cr/Mn (United G89) catalyst is shown in Table 5. Similar to the Cu/ZnO catalyst, CO and H2 are the major products at high methanol conversions. A significant amount of methyl formate was formed at low conversions.

It was found that the production of dimethyl ether can be correlated with the com- position of Cr in a variety of Cu based catalysts studied. This is shown in Fig. 5 for the Cu containing catalysts of various Cr compositions and with or without other additives (Mn, Ba and Si). The dimethyl ether yield increases monotonically with the composition of Cr. Little dimethyl ether was found in the absence of Cr. The dimethyl ether yield reached 4.6% at 75% Cr content. The effect of other additives on the yield is small compared to chromium. 6. Catalyst stability Although the ZnO free catalysts did not suffer the rapid deactivation at the early stage of the reaction, they were studied for the long-term stability as it is an important factor for the commercial application. It was found that the stability of the Cu based catalysts without the component Cr is rather poor. For example, the methanol conversion over a Cu/Si90/10 catalyst continuously decreases from 73.4 to 64.3% in 18 h reaction under the standard reaction conditions after one day operation. Addition of Cr improves the stability to a great extent. As an example, Fig. 6 illustrates a life-time study using Cu/Cr/Mn/Si 75/18/4/3 and Cu/Cr/Sr/ Si 48/39/10/3 catalysts under the conditions of 275 and 105 sccm methanol throughput, which were much harsher than the standard conditions used for the above Cu/Si catalyst.

Separate studies also showed that additives Mn and alkaline earth metals did not significantly influence the catalyst stability. Chromium is an essential component for the unsupported Cu based catalysts to achieve good stability. 7. XRD study 7.1. Cu/ZnO Previous work in my laboratory on in-situ XRD of Cu/ZnO catalysts during calcination and reduction indicated that the metallic Cu and ZnO phases are formed after reduction [26]. To study why the Cu/ZnO catalyst deactivates, the XRD patterns of two spent Cu/ZnO catalysts are shown in Fig. 7. These two catalysts were prepared from the same precursors, calcined at different temperatures, reduced at the standard conditions and used in methanol decomposition at 250 and 300 and briefly to 450 for 1 h before decreasing to 300. Similar to the freshly reduced catalyst, crystalline ZnO and Cu phases were observed. However, the metallic Cu peaks at 43.2and 50.4(20) were extended to the lower 20 angle in the spent catalysts. The extended peaks could be assigned to Cu/Zn alloys. Dis- solution of Zn in the Cu phase would make the Cu lattice expanded. A mixture of Cu/Zn alloys of different compositions would result in the shifted and broadened peaks. The formation of Cu/Zn alloys was observed for other deactivated Cu/ZnO based catalysts which were used in methanol decomposition at 250 only. How- ever, the Cu/Zn alloys are more readily formed at higher temperatures. If the metallic Cu is the active species, formation of the alloy would likely reduce the activity. This is consistent with the low activities of the Cu/ZnO catalysts compared to ZnO-free Cu containing catalysts. Our pretreatment conditions did not generate the Cu/Zn alloys in the fresh catalyst to any significant extent. This is also in agreement with the high initial activity of the catalyst. The activities of the above two Cu/ZnO catalysts before and after 450 surge are further compared in Table 6. Clearly, the catalyst calcined at 350 is less active than that calcined at 300 at both stages. A comparison with Fig. 7 also indicates that the larger lattice expansion of the Cu phase results in a less active catalyst. The result is also consistent with the above judgement that metallic Cu is the active species and the dissolution of Zn in Cu reduces the activity. 7.2. Cu/Cr/Mn vs. Cu/Cr/Mn/Si A Cu/Cr/Mn 72/24/4 catalyst precursor was calcined and reduced in a con- trolled environment XRD chamber during recording the XRD patterns.

The calcination was followed by the reduction in H2/N2 5/95 at 250 for 1 h. The XRD patterns taken during the calcination and reduction are given in Fig. 8. The precursor is mostly amorphous. The calcination of the Cu/Cr/Mn catalyst above 400 revealed the presence of crystalline CuO and CuCr204. CuO was reduced to Cuand Cufr204 was decomposed presumably to Cuand amorphous Cr203 upon reduction in Hz. Cooling the XRD chamber to room temperature and exposing the catalyst to ambient air for a few hours would oxidize Cu to Cu20 as indicated in 24 W.-H.

The Cu/Cr/Mn/Si catalyst was mostly amorphous after calcination below 400. Comparing with Fig. 8 suggests that the Si component tends to stabilize the catalyst dispersion.

Finally, the phenomenon of lattice expansion of the Cu phase occurred in spent Cu/Zn catalysts was not observed in the ZnO free catalysts. 7.3. Bench-scale study Following the development of methanol dissociation catalysts in the laboratory- scale study described above, a bench-scale study was performed. The amount of the catalyst loaded and the methanol throughput were increased by 10 times from the standard reaction conditions used in the laboratory-scale study. A variety of commercially available Cu containing catalysts, a Fe/Cr catalyst and a Zn/Cr catalyst as well as Cu/Cr/Mn/Si and Cu/Cr/Ba/Si catalysts of this preparation were evaluated in a 1 inch O.D. reactor. The last two catalysts were the custom catalysts prepared by a catalyst company according to the details given in this paper. These catalysts were loaded and reduced in the reactor. The methanol conversion at 250 is compared in Fig. 10. The result confirms the laboratory-scale study and indicates the superior activities of the multicomponent Cu/Cr/Mn/Si and Cu/Cr/ Ba/Si catalysts. 26 W.-H.

Discussion Cu/Zn and Cu/Zn/Cr catalysts are good methanol synthesis catalysts. They have also been used in methanol decomposition [ 16,23]. However, our results indicate Cu/ZnO based catalysts are not good methanol decomposition catalysts in the absence of water. Superior activities were achieved with ZnO-free Cu con- taining multicomponent catalysts. The roles of Cu, Zn, Cr, and other components in methanol decomposition are discussed below. 8.1. Cu This study suggests that Cu (probably metallic Cu) is the active phase based on the following observations. ( 1 ) Zn/Cr is a high temperature methanol decompo- sition catalyst and is not active at 250 or lower (Fig. 10). (2) Many ZnO-free Cu containing catalysts are active for the reaction (Fig. 2). (3) A silica supported Cu catalyst shows reasonably good activity. (4) Activity of Cu/Zn containing catalysts decreases when dissolution of Zn in metallic Cu lattice occurs (Fig. 7). The extent of activity reduction increases with the extent of Zn dissolution ( Table 6). ( 5 ) A separate ESCA study in this laboratory on the spent Cu containing catalysts showed that surface Cu is mostly in the Custate. No Cu2 was observed. These results strongly suggest that metallic Cu is the active species although the reaction over Cu(I) cannot be ruled out in the present study. W.-H. Cheng /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 13-30 27 8.2. Zn Although ZnO is a necessary component in methanol synthesis reaction, this study clearly shows that it is an unnecessary and undesired component in methanol decomposition over Cu based catalysts in the absence of water. Cu and ZnO have a synergetic effect in the synthesis reaction. ZnO also provides an adsorption site for water [ 12 ], and therefore may be beneficial in the steam reforming of methanol. It was found in this study that the initial activity of Cu/ZnO containing catalysts in methanol decomposition is also high. ZnO may help to disperse or support active Cu species. However, the activity of Cu/ZnO containing catalysts quickly decreases. This rapid deactivation was not observed when the component ZnO was not present in Cu containing catalysts. This deactivation is accompanied by over- balanced oxygen to carbon ratio in the products over the fresh catalyst (Table 2). The excess oxygen in the products may be resulted from three possibilities: reduc- tion of ZnO, removal of adsorbed water on ZnO and formation of oxygen and hydrogen deficient carbonaceous deposits. However, the H to C was well balanced at the same time. This suggests that the latter two possibilities are less likely in favor of reduction of ZnO. Although the reducibility of ZnO itself is limited [ 27 ], its extent can become significant in the presence of a metal. Formation of Pt-Zn [28,29], Pd-Zn [30], Rh-Zn [31] and Cu-Zn [32] alloys has been reported for ZnO supported Pt, Pd, Rh or Cu catalysts after reduction. Some studies also showed that the reducible ZnO support modified the catalytic properties of Pd [ 33,34]. Cheng and Kung in a study of adsorption and temperature-programmed decom- position of methanol on ZnO surfaces indicated that excess oxygen was present in the products resulting in creation of oxygen vacancies [ 13 ]. Adsorption of CO on ZnO nonpolar (1010) surface results in desorption of CO2 and creation of oxygen vacancies upon heating [ 35 ]. These are consistent with the above suggestion that ZnO is reduced in the initial reaction of methanol decomposition. Integrating the amount of the excess oxygen in the products with time reveals that the amount of excess oxygen formed in the reaction was equivalent to about 10% of lattice oxygen of ZnO in the Cu/Zn/Cr catalyst. Reduction of ZnO could facilitate dissolution of Zn into the Cu lattice. This is also consistent with the XRD study which indicates the formation of Cu/Zn alloys in methanol decomposition. The extent of dissolution of zinc into the Cu lattice can be estimated from the lattice spacing of brass [32]. Using the lattice spacing of a-brass derived from the XRD study (Fig. 7), we estimate that the average content of zinc in a-brass shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b corresponds to about 15 atom-% and 18 atom-%, respectively. The above two catalysts were once operated at 450. The zinc content in a-brass is about 2 to 3 atom-% for catalysts which were conducted at 250 only. These values are not inconsistent with the thermodynamic calculation of equilibrium zinc content in the brass [36], taking Pco/Pco2 between 30 to 50, a typical range in the effluent of our methanol decomposition reactor. The surface content of zinc would be much higher because of surface segregation of zinc [37]. The formation of the alloys 28 W.-H. Cheng /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 13-30 parallels with a significant loss of catalyst activity. By eliminating the ZnO com- ponent, ZnO-free Cu containing catalysts have much enhanced activity. It can be concluded that ZnO adversely affects the Cu based catalysts in methanol decom- position by dissolution of Zn into active Cu species. 8.3. Cr Cr is present in an amorphous state in working catalysts. The reaction study clearly indicates that Cr helps to maintain the catalyst stability in methanol decom- position reaction. Cu containing catalysts without Cr such as Cu/Si also have good initial activity. However, they suffer gradual deactivation with significant loss of surface area. These results suggest that the Cr species helps to disperse or support the active Cu species and maintain its activity in methanol decomposition reaction. However, acidic character of chromia causes the dehydration reaction of methanol to dimethyl ether to a small extent. This was evidenced by a correlation between the dimethyl ether yield and the Cr content (Fig. 5). The production of dimethyl ether reflects a loss of CO selectivity, and loss of heating value of the fuel. Cu to Cr weight ratios of about 3 / 1 to 1 / 1 are recommended to obtain good stability and to minimize the selectivity loss. The catalyst activity only slightly varies with the Cu to Cr ratio (Table 3). It implies that a decrease in the Cu content may be compensated by an increase of the dispersion because of the corresponding increased concentration of Cr. 8.4. Si, Ba or Mn A small amount (typically, 2 to 4 wt.-%) of Ba, Mn and Si oxides significantly enhance the activity of Cu containing catalysts. Further increases of the concentra- tions of these additives were not beneficial. It indicates that these additives act as promoters. The promoting mechanism of Ba and Mn in methanol decomposition has not been clear at the present study. Nonetheless, Ba and Mn have been used in Cu/Cr based catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. The promoting effect of the component Si is interesting. The XRD Study shows that silica increases the dis- persion of metallic Cu in the working catalysts and retards the formation of crys- talline Cut and CuCr204 during calcination (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). Crystalline Cut will be reduced to metallic Cu of high crystallinity after the subsequent hydrogen treatment [ 26 ]. Calcined catalysts in an amorphous state will lead to dispersed Cu after reduction [26]. The promoting effect of silica may thus be attributed to increased dispersion of Cu. Silica in our catalysts was also present in an amorphous state. 2 to 3 wt.-% Si drastically enhances the activity, but further increase in silica content decreases the activity (Fig. 3). Based on this result, we may further pos- tulate that silica is porously coated or dispersed on the Cu surfaces as a texture promoter to retard the sintering of Cu, but allows the reactant and products to get through if only a small quantity of silica is present. Large quantity of silica would W.-H. Cheng /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 13-30 29 retard the methanol reaction by blocking the active site or increasing the diffusion resistance. Based on the experimental results and the above rationality, we recommended multicomponent Cu / Cr / Mn / Si or Cu / Cr / B a / Si catalysts with the Cu to Cr weight ratio of 1/1 to 3/1 and 2 to 4 wt.-% of Si, Ba or Mn for methanol decomposition to achieve high activity at low temperatures, good selectivity and stability. A bench- scale study of 10 times increase in scale from the laboratory study confirms the superior activities of the multicomponent catalysts (Fig. 10). 9. Conclusions 1. ZnO adversely affects the activity of Cu containing catalysts in methanol decom- position. Conventional Cu/ZnO based methanol synthesis catalysts have good initial activity in methanol decomposition reaction, but quickly deactivate. Reduction of ZnO was suggested and formation of Cu-Zn alloys was evidenced in methanol decomposition. These contribute to the catalyst deactivation. 2. Cu-containing multicomponent catalysts without ZnO were developed. The cat- alysts have high activity at low temperatures, high selectivity to CO and good stability. The constituents include Cu, Cr, Si, O and Ba or Mn. 3. Cu species, probably metallic Cu is the active ingredient for methanol decom- position. Cr oxide stabilizes the dispersion of the active Cu species and is an essential component to achieve good stability. Small amount of Si, Ba and Mn oxides promote the reaction over Cu containing catalysts. The promoting effect of silica can be attributed to increased dispersion of Cu. 4. Methyl formate is a primary product in methanol decomposition. The methyl formate intermediate is further decomposed to CO and methanol. Dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether occurs on chromium oxide to a small extent and constitutes a major loss of the selectivity. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank A.

Present address: Department of Chemical Engineering, Chang Gung University of Medicine and Technology, 259 Wen-Hwa 1 road, Kweishan, Taoyuan, Taiwan. A series of Cu based catalysts with and without ZnO have been studied for methanol decomposition in the absence of water. CO and H2 are the major products. A significant amount of methyl formate is produced at low conversions and low reaction temperatures. Cu ZnO based catalysts show high initial activity but quickly deactivate. This may be attributed to the dissolution of Zn into the Cu lattice. Without the component ZnO, other Cu based catalysts show good activity and better stability. Cr increases the stability of the Cu based catalysts but slightly reduces the selectivity to CO. The composition of Cr correlates with the yield of dimethyl ether. Among many other components evaluated, a small amount of Ba, Mn and Si oxides strongly promote the Cu based catalysts in methanol decomposition. Cu, Cr, Si, O and Ba or Mn constitute the components of the highly active multicomponent catalyst. Characterizations of the catalysts combined with the compositional study suggest that metallic Cu is the active species for methanol decomposition. Silica enhances the activity probably by increasing the dispersion of Cu. Keywords Methanol Decomposition Dissociation Cu Cu ZnO Syngas XRD References [1] W.H. Cheng and A.

        "dc:description": "A series of Cu based catalysts with and without ZnO have been studied for methanol decomposition in the absence of water. CO and H2 are the major products. A significant amount of methyl formate is produced at low conversions and low reaction temperatures. Cu ZnO based catalysts show high initial activity but quickly deactivate. This may be attributed to the dissolution of Zn into the Cu lattice. Without the component ZnO, other Cu based catalysts show good activity and better stability. Cr increases the stability of the Cu based catalysts but slightly reduces the selectivity to CO. The composition of Cr correlates with the yield of dimethyl ether. Among many other components evaluated, a small amount of Ba, Mn and Si oxides strongly promote the Cu based catalysts in methanol decomposition. Cu, Cr, Si, O and Ba or Mn constitute the components of the highly active multicomponent catalyst. Characterizations of the catalysts combined with the compositional study suggest that metallic Cu is the active species for methanol decomposition. Silica enhances the activity probably by increasing the dispersion of Cu.",
