However, the former reaction gives methane almost exclusively, while the latter reaction can give methanol. Since supported ruthenium catalysts usually catalyze both hydrogenations of CO and CO2 with almost the same rate, Raney ruthenium catalysts were shown to be uniquely active for hydro- genation of CO2 under the conditions studied here. The weight-based activity of methane production from CO2 and hydrogen is much higher than that of the supported catalysts at 353-413 K and under 80 kPa. Methanol was also produced from CO2 on Raney ruthenium catalysts, though the selectivity was negligibly lower than that from CO. With the mixtures of CO, CO2, and H2 at 353 K and under 80 kPa, CO was preferentially hydrogenated, unless composition of CO was very small. Reaction mechanisms of CO-CO2 hydrogenation are proposed.

Introduction In hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO), ruthenium (Ru) catalysts usually dissociate the C-O bond easily and are effective for methanation [ 1,2 ] and Fischer- Tropsch synthesis [ 3-5 ]. However, Raney Ru catalysts pretreated by a mixed gas of HaO vapor and He produce methanol with high activity and high selectivity * Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 81-45) 9245416, fax.

[6,7]. H20-He pretreatment oxidizes aluminum (A1) and Ru atoms probably adjacent to A1 on the surface of the catalysts. Existence of cationic Ru (Ru\"+) stabilized with the oxidized AI (A1203) has been discussed as the active center of methanol synthesis keeping the C-O bond, while metallic parts (Ru activating H atoms. In this paper, Raney Ru catalysts were used for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2). The activity and the selectivity were studied and compared with the reaction of CO. The nature of the Raney Ru was compared with the supported Ru catalysts which had been well studied. 2. Experimental 2.1. Experimental system A scheme of the apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. The main part was made of Pyrex glass and connected to an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC- 4BPTF) for reactants and products analyses. Hydrogen (99.99%) and helium (99.995%) were purified by passing through a cold trap with dehydrated molecular sieves 5A at 77 K, respectively. CO2 (99.5%) and CO (99.95%) were deoxygen- ated with a 'Gasclean GC-RX' (an oxygen remover produced by Nikka Seiko Co., Ltd.) and passed through an MS-5A trap at 194 K, respectively. The treated CO2 K. Takeishi, K.-i. Aika/Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 31-45 33 was further purified by fractional distillation. Nitrogen (99.99%) was deoxygen- ated with a 'Gasclean GC-RX' and passed through a liquid-N2 cold trap. 2.2. Development of Raney Ru catalysts Suitable weights (0.6-2.0 g) of Raney Ru alloy (Ru / A1 = 50 / 50 in weight ratio) were leached with about 5 mol dm-3 potassium hydroxide aqueous solution at about 373 K until H2 evolution ceased (about 2 h) [ 6-8 ]. After cooling, they were washed several times with decantation until the pH of the solutions reached 7. A few washings with decantation followed. The leached sample powders were care- fully transferred to the catalyst chambers together with some water under deoxy- genated N2 gas atmosphere, and evacuated for 10 h at room temperature. 2.3. Pretreatment of Raney Ru catalysts The catalyst in the reaction chamber was reduced with a circulating H2 (53 kPa) at 573 K for 1.5 h with a liquid-N2 cold trap, and evacuated for 1 h. The reduction of the catalyst was repeated again for 2 h, and the catalyst was evacuated for 1.5 h. The reduced catalyst was then pretreated with circulating H20 (2.7 kPa)-He (27 kPa) gas mixture at a temperature of 373, 473, or 573 K for 15 h. After the H20- He pretreatment, the mixed gas was circulated with the liquid-N2 cold trap for 1 h to remove of H20, and evacuation for 1.5 h was carried out. Before the reaction, the BET surface area from N2 physisorption was measured at 77 K and the H2 chemisorption was determined under 30 kPa at 273 K. The percent of exposed metallic Ru was estimated by: Total amount of chemisorbed hydrogen atoms (atoms g-l)/BET surface area (m2 g- 1)/Weight of the catalyst (g) / 1.63 1019 (atoms m-z) 100 [9]. 2.4. COe and CO hydrogenation over Raney Ru catalysts CO2 hydrogenation was carried out at 353 K and under an 80-kPa pressure of CO:/H2 ( = 1/3 molar ratio) gas mixture. Products of reaction were condensed by a dry-ice and methanol cold trap, a part of the apparatus. CO hydrogenation was also carried out for comparison under the same conditions using CO/Hz ( 1/3 molar ratio) mixed gas. Methanol, ethanol, and hydrocarbons with a carbon number of 3 to 8, recovered as products, were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and two columns filled with Porapak Q (80-100 mesh, 2 m long, diameter= 3 mm) and Porapak R (80-100 mesh, 1 m long, diameter = 3 mm) in series. Gaseous methane and ethane separated by acti- vated charcoal (80-100 mesh, 2 m long, diameter = 3 mm) were detected by FID, and the separated CO2 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Alcohol and hydrocarbon selectivities were calculated as the carbon base percentage 34 K. Takeishi, K.-i. Aika /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 31~15 of each alcohol and hydrocarbon against all the analyzed alcohols and hydrocar- bons, for example: Selectivity to ethanol (%) = Amount of ethanol (n mol g ~ h-~) X 2 (carbon number of ethanol) / Summation of carbon base amount ( each analyzed product ( n mol g- ~h- J ) each carbon number) 100. 2.5. Extraction of Run + by thiourea solution After the hydrogenation, amount ofRun + on the Raney Ru surface was measured by a thiourea solution method [ 7 ]. The catalysts after the reactions were transferred into 20-ml mixed solution (81% thiourea aqueous solution 0.18 ml, 12 mol dm-3 HC1 aq. 0.83 ml, and ethanol) in Schlenk's tubes under argon atmosphere. The thiourea solutions were deoxygenated by 10-min Nz gas bubbling before the extrac- tion. The cationic Ru was extracted with the thiourea solution by a 20-min reflux at 363 K, and the solution was filtered under Ar atmosphere. The amount of Run thiourea complexes in the solution was measured by using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi Model 100-40). RuC13-thiourea solutions were used as a calibration stan- dard for the spectrophotometric measurement of the Run thiourea samples at a wavelength of 620 nm. 3. Results 3.1. HeO-He pretreatment effect on COe hydrogenation and CO hydrogenation The results of the reactions carried out for 5 h at 353 K under 80 kPa (C02/ Ha = CO/Ha = 1/3) are shown in Table 1. Two reduced Raney Ru catalysts (0.3 g), and three HzO-He (at 373,473, and 573 K) pretreated catalysts were used for CO2 and CO hydrogenation. The conversion was less than 5%. In previous papers [6,7] Raney catalysts were not reduced by H2 before the H20-He pretreatment. Therefore, their BET surface area and percent of reduced surface Ru were decreased due to the higher treatment temperature. However, in this study Raney catalysts were reduced by Ha at 573 K before HzO-He pretreat- ments. By this procedure, the BET surface area and percent of reduced surface Ru gave almost reproducible values, 33-38 m2 g- ~ and 73-79%, respectively, except the untreated catalysts. HzO-He pretreatment resulted in lower BET surface area, higher surface percent of Ru and higher amount of Run +, irrespective of the pretreatment temperature. Therefore, the differences in each value of the BET surface area and the percent of exposed Ruare neglected as the factors of the catalyst activity in this study. Supported Ru catalysts mainly produce methane from CO2 and Ha [ 10,11]. Raney Ru catalysts studied here also produces methane, yet small amounts of methanol and ethanol were also produced from CO2 hydrogenation. The activity K. Takeishi, K.-i.

However, the methanol formation by CO2 hydrogenation was not related with the HeO-He pretreatment. These results suggest that Run + and AP + are important for methanol formation from CO, but these cations do not seem to be very important for methanol formation from CO2 and H2. The remarkable fact was that methane was produced thousands of times more than the amount of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation, but the amounts of methanol formed were of similar level either from CO or CO2. The selectivity to methane was 96-97% from CO2. CO gives both alkane and alkene, however, CO2 gives alkane exclusively in the hydrocarbons. 3.2. Reaction temperature dependency of C02 hydrogenation The reaction temperature was varied from 343 to 383 K for COe hydrogenation (2 h) on a Raney Ru catalyst ( 1.0 g) which was a different sample from that in the Table 1. The data are shown in Table 2. Between the each reaction, the catalyst was reduced with H2 (53 kPa) at 573 K for 2 h, and evacuated at 573 K for 1 h. The catalyst sample had a BET surface area of 36 m2 g-t, and chemisorbed H atoms of 42 X 10t9 atoms g- 1 which corresponded to be 77% of surface Ru atoms. Products analyzed were hydrocarbons (C1--C8), methanol, ethanol, and water. Hydrocarbons were mostly linear alkanes; for example Ca means n-octane. The formation rates of the major products, namely methane, ethane, and methanol were plotted against the reciprocal reaction temperature in Fig. 2. From each slope, apparent activation energies for methane, ethane, and methanol formation were 81, 93, and 49 kJ mol-1, respectively. The apparent activation energy for methane formation was almost the same as that on Ru/SiO2 (82 kJ mol-1) [ 12,13], but K. Takeishi, K.-i.

Interestingly, the apparent activation energy for methanol formation on Raney Ru (49 kJ mol - ~ ) was almost identical to that on Cu/ZnO (47 kJ mol-1) [ 15] and was slightly higher than that on Cu/ZnO/A1203 (39 kJ mo1-1) [ 16]. 3.3. Reaction temperature dependency of CO hydrogenation The reaction temperature was varied from 343 to 383 K for CO hydrogenation (2 h) on a Raney Ru catalyst ( 1.0 g) pretreated by HzO-He at 474 K. The results are shown in Table 3. Adsorption data on the catalyst were as follows; BET surface area; 41 m2 g- ', H atoms chemisorbed; 46 X 10j9 atoms g- ', surface Rupercent; 69%. The produced hydrocarbons contain both alkanes and alkenes; however, the total amounts were shown for each carbon number in Table 3. The CO conversion was not calculated, but it should be very small. Methane was not detected, because products were trapped at liquid nitrogen temperature, in this case. Selectivities of methanol formation from CO and H2 in Table 3 were lower than that in Table 1. We noticed that methanol production increased with the reaction time until 20 h as is shown in Fig. 3, while hydrocarbons did not. The data in Table 3 are the results 38 K. Takeishi, K.-i.

In the case of methanol formation, 120 kJ mol - ~ is much higher than 75 kJ mol- on Cu/ZnO/AI203 [16] and 34--69 kJ mo1-1 on Cu/ZnO [15]. As has been pointed out, the methanol formation rate is not a steady-state value. The initial increase of the rate might be much more pronounced at higher temperature. That may be the reason of the unusually high value of the activation energy. 3.4. Hydrogenation of COz-CO mixture The mixed gas of H2/(CO2 \"4- CO) = 3 / 1 (80 kPa) was reacted at 353 K for 5 h on a Raney Ru catalyst (0.5 g) that was pretreated by HzO-He at 473 K. The mixing ratio of CO2 and CO was changed. The surface data of the catalyst were as follows; BET surface area; 39 m2 g- i, H atoms chemisorbed; 46 1019 atoms g-~, o surface Ru percent; 72%. Hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and C3-C8), methanol, ethanol, and water were analyzed as products. Their production rates were plotted against the CO2 content, CO2/(CO2 + CO), in Fig. 5. The rate of methanol formation decreases slightly from 30 to 26 nmol g- 1 h- with increasing of CO2 ratio. In case of CO2 hydrogenation free from CO, 9.5 nmol g - ~ h- 1 of methanol was produced. Chanchlani et al. [ 16 ] studied an effect of the CO2 content over Cu/ZnO / AlzO3 catalyst. On Cu / ZnO / A1203, methanol synthesis rate increases with increasing CO2 content especially from 0.0 to 0.3. The effect, here, on the Raney Ru is significantly different from the effect on Cu/ZnO/AI203 catalyst. The ethanol production increases with the CO2 content from 0.4 to 0.6 40 K. Takeishi, K.-i.

A drastic change of production was observed on methane. Methane increases from 4 to 78 nmol g t h t with increasing CO2 content, and finally to 75 X 103 nmol g- ~ h- ~ without CO. It corresponds to about thousand times increase. C8 production rate increases slightly from 2 to 5 nmol g-J h-~ with increasing CO2 ratio, but it decreased to 0.2 nmol g ~ h-1 with pure CO2 and H2. Water production was constant 40 X 103 nmol g-1 h ~ at any mixing ratio, but, five times more water ( 19 104 nmol g t h ] ) was produced, when CO was eliminated. 4. Discussion 4.1. Suggested mechanism of C0-C02 hydrogenation over Raney Ru These results suggest that CO is preferentially hydrogenated compared with CO2 unless CO content is extremely small. This is responsible for the fact that the product distribution pattern and the reaction rate of hydrogenation of the CO2-CO mixture are almost the same as those of pure CO hydrogenation. It is suggested that CO molecules are adsorbed onto Ru metal surface more strongly than CO2 molecules, and adsorbed CO molecules are activated, dissociated and further hydro- genated on Ru. CO2 cannot be adsorbed under the existence of CO. However, if there are no adsorbed CO molecules, CO2 molecules can be adsorbed on Ru metal K. Takeishi, K.-i.

These adsorbed CO2 molecules are easily hydrogenated to methane with a rate thousand' s times faster than that of CO hydrogenation. A simplified surface model of Raney Ru is shown in Fig. 6 for a CO/H2 or CO2/ Hz atmosphere. Proposed kinetic models are also shown below. Since CO covers most of the surface ( Eqs. 1 - 1 to 1 - 11 : CO hydrogenation on Raney Ru), the reaction rate expressions sometimes have a negative order with respect to CO pressure.

Takeishi, K.-i. Aika /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 31-45 Vannice [ 17] reported a kinetic result having - 0.6 order for CO pressure and 1.5 order for H2 pressure on Ru/A1203, which is very similar to Eq. 1-11 proposed here. The proposed model assumes that CO(a) is a main adsorbed species with a small amount of C(a) and H(a) as active species. Pure CO2 is considered to be adsorbed weakly, but activated easily to give intermediate such as C (a) (or CHx) with a very fast rate (Eqs. 2-1 to 2-7:CO2 hydrogenation on Raney Ru). 0c (active species) << 1 (2-1) K4 CO2+2H2+* ~ C(a) +2H20 (2-2) K4Pco2PZ2 0c 2 (2-3) PH20 OH (active species) << 1 (2-4) K3 H2+2\" ~ 2H(a) (2-5) 0n = K3P~25 (2-6) kPco2P~ rco2 (reaction rate) = kOcOH P2o (2-7) CO2 does not retard C (a) and H (a) ( Eqs. 2-3 and 2-6 ). Hydrogen is easily adsorbed on CO free surface giving methane exclusively (Fig. 6B). However, if CO is present, CO2 adsorption rate (Eq. 3-1) and hydrogenation rate (Eq. 3-2) are retarded very much (Eqs. 1-1, 1-8, 3-1 to 3-3:CO2 hydrogenation in the presence of CO on Raney Ru).

These models explain well the result of Fig. 5. Nagata et al. [ 18 ] reported that CO most strongly inhibits the CO2 adsorption on ruthenium catalysts among platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium cata- K. Takeishi, K.-i. Aika / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 31~15 43 lysts. They also studied hydrogenation of CO-CO2 mixture on palladium catalysts. Amount of methane produced by the hydrogenation rapidly decreased with increas- ing CO ratio from 0 to 0.3. When the CO ratio was more than 0.3, total amount of methane produced by the CO-CO2 hydrogenation was the same as a methane amount produced from CO/H2. They have also speculated that this is due to the CO inhibition against CO2 adsorption. Their data obtained by the time programmed reduction suggests that ruthenium is inhibited most strongly by the CO adsorption among the platinum groups. 4.2. Effect of H20-He pretreatment to Raney Ru catalysts Yano et al. [6] have reported that H20-He pretreatment oxidizes surface A1 on Raney Ru with higher temperatures. Produced A13 + is considered to be responsible for methanol production activating C-O bond without breaking on such sites as RuA13+ [6]. We were further successful to extract Run+ by thiourea solution and found that the methanol production is also related with Run +, suggestion the active sites' formation such as RuRun (or with AI3 +) [7]. In this study we proved this again for CO hydrogenation. Ruis also necessary to activated H2. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation, the H20-He pretreatment did not improve the selectivity for methanol formation. Instead, the methanol production was slightly decreased and the methane production was slightly increased. This phenomenon is opposite to that in CO hydrogenation. This is probably because that CO2 is not stabilized on RuRun (A13 + ) sites and the concentration of CO (a), which may be an intermediate from CO2 to C(a), may be quite small. 4.3. Comparison of methane synthesis rates in C02 hydrogenation Inui et al. [ 12,13 ] have reported turnover number for methane formation (NM) and space time yield (STYM) on several catalysts at 500 K. Methane production rate from CO2 and H2 at 500 K on our Raney Ru was estimated to be 0.25 mol g- h- 1 assuming the relationship in Fig. 2. Surface metal site of Raney Ru catalyst is calculated as 0.70 mmol g- l, and volume of that is 0.8 ml g- 1. Therefore, NM and STYM of the Raney Ru catalyst at 500 K are extrapolated as 10X 10-2 s-i and 31 10 mol 1-~ h-~, respectively. The calculated values are listed on Table 4 together with data reported. NM of the Raney Ru (0.10 s - ~ ) was found to be in the similar level to that of 3.3%Ru/SiO2 (0.20 s- 1 ). This suggests that the active site structure of Raney Ru for methanation formation is similar to that of supported Ru. However, STYM or the per gram activity of the Raney Ru catalysts (310 mol 1-i h- 1 ) is much higher than those of other catalysts (6.5, 9.6 mol 1-1 h- 1 ), because surface metal sites of Raney Ru catalysts are denser than the supported catalysts. In this sense, Raney Ru is a very attractive catalyst for methane synthesis from CO2 and H2. 44 K. Takeishi, K.-i.

Comparison between methanation of COe and CO Bardet et al. [19] noted that on Ni/MgO catalysts the methanation of CO2 proceeded more rapidly and at lower reaction temperature than that of CO. Solymosi and Erd6helyi [20] compared methanation of CO2 and CO of several alumina- supported noble metals. Inui et al. [ 12,13 ] also compared those of several Ru and Ni catalysts. Those data, and the above-mentioned NM and STYM are summarized on Table 4. The data of Ni/MgO were extrapolated from a figure in Ref. [ 19]. The ratios of NM of CO2 (Nc) to NM of CO (Nc are different for the different catalysts, ranging from 0.08 to 1 l, except that of Raney Ru catalysts pretreated by H20-He. The rate ratio for the Raney Ru simply reduced by H2 (code number 1 in Table 1 ) stays in the above mentioned range of ratios. However, Raney Ru catalysts pretreated HzO-He shows much higher values by as much as three orders of magnitude. This is because that H20-He pretreatment oxidizes A1 and Ru to AP + and Run + decreasing Ruthat must he the C-O dissociation center to produce methane. Another reason may be that the reaction temperature studied here was lower than that of the other reports. K. Takeishi, K.-i. Aika /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 31-45 45 5. Conclusion Raney Ru was found to be a very effective catalyst for methane synthesis from CO2 and H2. Methanol is formed from CO2 and H2 as from CO and H2 over Raney Ru, but the main products are hydrocarbons, especially methane. The rate of meth- ane production was thousands' times as high as that of methanol production. The per gram activity for methane synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation was much higher than that of supported Ru catalysts because of the high concentration of active sites. However, the turnover number was nearly the same as those on the supported Ru. When CO2-CO mixtures are used as the reactant on Raney Ru, CO hydrogenation takes priority over CO2 hydrogenation. CO molecules adsorb strongly on the Ru metal surface and thus inhibit CO2 adsorption. Product distribution of the CO2-CO hydrogenation was similar to that of the CO hydrogenation, which was explained by the same mechanism.

On Raney ruthenium catalysts pretreated with a mixed gas of water vapor and helium, the rate of hydrogenation of CO2 was higher by three orders of magnitude than that of the hydrogenation of CO. However, the former reaction gives methane almost exclusively, while the latter reaction can give methanol. Since supported ruthenium catalysts usually catalyze both hydrogenations of CO and CO2 with almost the same rate, Raney ruthenium catalysts were shown to be uniquely active for hydrogenation of CO2 under the conditions studied here. The weight-based activity of methane production from CO2 and hydrogen is much higher than that of the supported catalysts at 353–413 K and under 80 kPa. Methanol was also produced from CO2 on Raney ruthenium catalysts, though the selectivity was negligibly lower than that from CO. With the mixtures of CO, CO2, and H2 at 353 K and under 80 kPa, CO was preferentially hydrogenated, unless composition of CO was very small. Reaction mechanisms of COCO2 hydrogenation are proposed.
