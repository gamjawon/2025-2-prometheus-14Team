Phthalide as an important value-added chemical can be fabricated through the hydrogenation of phthalic anhydride. However, the deactivation of metal supported catalysts for this reaction has limited its application. Herein, a series of NixCuy/Al2O3 alloy catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method and applied in the selective hydrogenation of PA to phthalide. Under mild reaction conditions (at 200 °C, 3 MPa H2), the optimal Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst shows the phthalic anhydride conversion of 91 % and phthalide selectivity of 97 %, respectively. Besides, this catalyst displays the good stability under five cycles without observing the obvious deactivation. The high efficiency of the Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst can be attributed to the electronic interaction of the two metals in NiCu alloy, which promotes the dissociation of H2 and suppresses the corrosion of alloy. This work reveals the electronic interaction between two metals, which provides a new avenue for rational design of alloy catalyst for selective hydrogenation of CO bonds. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords NiCu alloy Hydrogenation Phthalic anhydride Phthalide Data availability The data that has been used is confidential. 1 Introduction Phthalide as an important industrial fine chemical intermediate, has been widely applied in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and synthetic dyes, etc. Currently, phthalide is industrially produced through the reaction of phthalimide and sodium hydroxide with the yield of 80 %, but the high cost of raw materials and the environmental pollution caused by this synthesis process limited its application. Another method is the hydrogenation of phthalic anhydride (PA) by using zinc-acetic acid as reducing agent. However, this reduction process will cause the severely environmental pollution. Therefore, the hydrogenation of PA with hydrogen as reduction agent is a promising route to synthesize phthalide. Catalytic hydrogenation of PA to target phthalide requires selective cleavage of the CO bonds. So far, both noble metals (e.g. Au, Pd, Ru) and non-precious metals (e.g. Ni, Cu, Co) have been reported for the hydrogenation of the PA. Henkelmann et al. prepared a variety of supported catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation of PA to phthalide, and the noble metal-based Ag and Pd show the highest phthalide yield of 89 % [1]. Lately, due to the interface effect between Au and TiO2, the Au/Fe2O3-TiO2 catalyst exhibits the PA conversion of 95 %, and the phthalide selectivity of 94 % [2]. Although noble metals-based catalysts show an outstanding catalytic performance, its high price and the inevitable loss of precious metal through corrosion limit its application. Therefore, development of non-precious catalysts as an alternative of noble metal catalysts with excellent yields of phthalide and strong acid corrosion resistance is highly desired. Austin et al. used Ni/diatomite as catalyst for hydrogenation of PA, and the yield of phthalide was 72.4 % [3]. Massonne studied Raney Ni catalyst, and finally obtained PA conversion and phthalide selectivity of 99 % and 87 %, respectively [4]. Liu et al. prepared a Ni/TiO2-SiO2 catalyst for hydrogenation of PA to phthalide, which the maximum selectivity of phthalide was 88.5 % [5]. Unfortunately, Ni can also catalyze the rupture of C-C bond with the formation of strong acid by-products (e.g. o-toluic acid and hexahydro-o-toluic acid) [6], which is detrimental for the Ni-based catalysts. In general, the acid resistance of the catalyst can be significantly improved by doping the second element in the parent metal lattice to form an alloy or intermetallic compound, and using an inert carrier to protect the active metals [7,8]. Liang et al. prepared a variety of highly dispersed intermetallic Co-Ni silicide catalysts embedded in a porous carbon matrix (Co x Ni2-xSi@C) showed a PA conversion of 97.7 % and phthalide selectivity of 91.8 % [9]. Liu et al. prepared a Ni-Fe/AC-NaBH4 catalysts for hydrogenation of PA to phthalide with 100 % of PA conversion and 95.2 % of phthalide selectivity, and behaved a remarkable acid-resistant ability [10]. Compared with the monometallic catalysts, supported bimetallic catalysts are also good alternatives due to its superior catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [11,12]. Cu-based catalysts show the high efficiency in C-O/CO bonds hydrogenation, the moderate ability for the activation of hydrogen [13] and the poor reactivity for C-C bond cleavage [13–15]. Therefore, the hydrogenation activity of Cu-based catalysts for CO and CC bonds is generally lower than Ni-based catalyst [16,17]. For instance, the constructed Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts are used in the CO hydrogenation [18], ethanol and tars steam reforming [19], and selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde [20,21]. The interaction between two metals in alloy can realize the synergistic effect for realizing the improved catalytic activity in comparison with Ni. Therefore, it is proposed that the doping of Cu into Ni can alleviate the ability for rupture the C-C bonds and facilitate the dissociation of CO bonds, which is conductive to the conversion of PA to Phthalide. Herein, a series of bifunctional Ni x Cu y /Al2O3(x/y = 10:0, 9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 1:9, 0:10) catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method [22] and explored in the selective hydrogenation of PA to phthalide. The optimized catalyst NiCu/Al2O3 shows high selectivity of phthalide up to 97 % for the hydrogenation of PA, which is better than that of their mono-metal catalysts. The superior catalytic activity can be attributed to the form of NiCu alloy by doping Cu into Ni, which alleviate the ability for rupture the C-C bond and facilitate the dissociation of CO bonds. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The chemicals used in this work including Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O (98 %, Damas-Beta), Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O (99 %, Macklin), pseudo-boehmite, Zr(NO3)4·5 H2O (99.99 %, Macklin), TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O (93 %, Macklin), SiO2 (Fumed, S BET of 150 m2/g), phthalic anhydride (99 %, Macklin), cyclohexane (99.7 %, Rionlon), tetrahydrofuran (99.5 %, Rionlon), hexadecane (99 %, Macklin). Hydrogen (>99.99 % purity) was purchased from Lanzhou Yulong Gas Co. Ltd. Deionized water was lab-synthesized. All chemicals were not further purified. 2.2 Catalyst preparation A series of structure versatile bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts were prepared through a modified deposition-precipitation method [22]. Briefly, the Al2O3 support was calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 h before precipitation. The calculated amount of Na2CO3 were dissolved in 250 mL deionized water respectively to form a salt solution. The calculated amount of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water to form a mixed salt solution, and then it was added drop-wise into the above mixed salt solution. Stirred at room temperature for 3 h. After the suspension was aging for 12 h at 70 °C, the precipitate was filtered and thoroughly washed until the pH was around 7. The catalysts were dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined at 350 °C for 4 h in air. The reduced catalysts are marked as Ni x Cu y /Al2O3, where x, y represents the mole number of nickel and copper, respectively. To better investigate the effect of molar ratio of Ni to Cu on catalyst activity, the NiCu total weight loading is fixed at 30 %, while Ni-Cu molar ratios (9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7 and 1:9). The monometallic Ni-Al2O3 and Cu-Al2O3 catalysts are prepared using the same method as the Ni x Cu y /Al2O3 and these monometallic catalysts have the same weight loading. The other supported-NiCu catalysts, such as Ni9Cu1/SiO2, Ni9Cu1/ZrO2 and Ni9Cu1/TiO2, are prepared by using the same method as the Ni x Cu y /Al2O3. 2.3 Catalysts characterization 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction XRD analysis were performed on an Ultima Ⅳ Rigaku (Japan) and equipment with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15416 nm) operating in a 2θ range of 5°–90° at a scan rate of 10° per minute. 2.3.2 High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) The morphologies and structure were investigated on a HRTEM (FEI Tecnai F30, NL). 2.3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray Auger spectral (XAES) XPS and XAES were performed on a spectrometer (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD). The spectra were collected using an Al Kα X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV). All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV. 2.3.4 H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) The reducibility of the calcined catalysts was characterized by H2-TPR. The samples were tested using the Micromerics AutoChem II 2920 instrument with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.4 Catalyst evaluation The experimental data of Ni x Cu y /Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. PA hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 50 mL autoclave reactor at a stirring speed of 600 rpm. Prior to the reaction test, the catalysts were reduced at 350 °C in 10 % H2/Ar for 3 h to obtain the active catalysts. Typically, 0.5 g of reactant, 0.05 g of reduced catalyst, and 10 mL of cyclohexane were charged into the autoclave. The air in the reactor was replaced by 3.0 MPa hydrogen with three times, and then the autoclave was pressurized with H2 and heated to the reaction temperature. After a given reaction time, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, and then the products were analyzed by GC and GC-MS instruments. The reaction products were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent 8890) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an OV-1701 capillary columns (30 m × 320 µm). n-Hexadecane was used as internal standard to calibrate the products and carbon balances. Catalyst amount and reaction time were varied for the control of reaction conversion. The conversion of substrate and the selectivity of products were calculated on a carbon basis by following Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) conversion = mol initial reactant − mo l unreacted reactant mol initial reactant × 100 % (2) Selectivity = mol product × n C atoms in product mo l total C atoms of in detected product × 100 % 3 Result and discussion In this work, a series of bimetallic Ni x Cu y /Al2O3(x/y = 10:0, 9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 1:9, 0:10) catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method and applied in the selective hydrogenation of PA to phthalide. Fig. 1 shows the catalytic performance of as-prepared bimetallic NiCu/Al2O3 catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of PA. The experimental results show that the support remarkably affects the activity of supported Ni9Cu1 catalysts. Compared with the Ni9Cu1/Al2O3, the catalysts with other supports (SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2) provide inferior conversion of the PA hydrogenation [23]. The catalytic activity of these catalysts is as following: Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 > Ni9Cu1/SiO2 > Ni9Cu1/TiO2 > Ni9Cu1/ZrO2 (Fig. 1a). The molar ratio of Ni-Cu is also investigated based on the NixCuy/Al2O3 systems (Fig. 1b). With increasing the content of Cu in Ni x Cuy/Al2O3, the PA conversion decreases while the phthalide selectivity increases. As a result, Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst shows a superior activity with the PA conversion of 40 % and the phthalide selectivity of 99 %. Though the PA conversion can achieve 85 % on Ni/Al2O3, while the phthalide selectivity decreases to 89 %, indicating that the nicked-based catalyst can catalyze the undesired C-C bond rupture to form a certain amount of by-products [19]. To our delight, remarkable enhancement in phthalide selectivity is observed over the Cu-decorated Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, as compared to those of the monometallic counterparts of Cu/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with the same metal loadings. With increasing the reaction temperature, the conversion of PA increase but the selectivity of phthalide decrease. The Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst displays the PA conversion of 90 % and phthalide selectivity of 97 % at 200 °C. The hydrogen pressure also shows the significant effect for the hydrogenation of PA, with the hydrogen pressure increasing from 1 to 2 MPa, the PA conversion increase sharply, and then increasing hydrogen pressure from 2 to 4 MPa, the PA conversion slightly increase but the phthalide selectivity remarkably decrease. Therefore, the conversion of PA reaches 91 % and selectivity of phthalide reaches 98 % over Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst. Under the optimum temperature (200 °C) and pressure (3 MPa) conditions, The Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst shows the promising potential of Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation of PA to phthalide. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts with different Ni-Cu molar ratios. Monometallic Cu/Al2O3 catalyst shows two diffraction peaks centered at 43.2° and 50.4° with corresponding to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) reflections of the metallic Cu (JCPDS # 04-0836). Notably, with doping Ni into Cu, no diffraction peaks assignable to Ni are observed in the XRD patterns of NixCuy/Al2O3 catalysts, which can be attributed to the high homogeneous distribution of Ni in these samples. Fig. 2b shows the enlarged XRD patterns ranged from 38 to 48°. Different from monometallic Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, with increases the content of Ni, the diffraction peaks of catalysts gradually shift to the high angle, in which the peak is between monometallic Cu and Ni diffraction peaks. Such results suggest the formation of Ni-Cu alloy, which is consistent with previous studies on Ni-Cu bimetallic catalyst [24–26]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the interplanar crystal spacing of Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst is measured to be 0.181 nm which is nearly equal to the (200) crystal face of Cu (Fig. 2c). High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) shows the uniform distribution of Ni-Cu alloy on alumina carrier (Fig. 2d). The surface chemical states and compositions of monometallic Cu, Ni and bimetallic Ni-Cu samples are characterized by XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show the XPS spectra of the Ni 2p3/2 and Cu 2p3/2 signals of the Ni x Cu y /Al2O3. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the Ni 2p3/2 spectra display three peaks centered at 852.3 eV, 855.8 eV, and 861.6 eV, which can be attributed to the metallic Ni, Ni2+, and Ni satellite peak, respectively[27]. Compared with the Ni0 species of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst that is located at 852.3 eV, the peak that is assigned to Ni0 species shifts toward a higher binding energy with doping Cu. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the Cu 2p3/2 spectra display three peaks centered at 932.6 eV, 935.1 eV, and 943.3 eV, which can be assigned to Cu, Cu2+, and Cu satellite peak, respectively. In addition to Ni species, the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 in the Cu/Al2O3 shifts to lower binding energy of 931.8 eV. These results clearly show the transfer of electron from Ni to Cu and demonstrate that the interaction between Ni and Cu have been formed with the constructing of NiCu alloy. To investigate the interaction between Ni and Cu species, the reduction behavior of Ni x Cu y /Al2O3 is characterized by using H2-TPR (Fig. 3c). Since Al2O3 cannot be reduced in the studied temperature range, the reduction peaks shown in Fig. 3c are mainly the reductions of different Ni and Cu species. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a major reduction peak at around 422 °C, and the Cu-Al2O3 exhibits a major reduction peak at around 208 °C. By contrast, with doping Ni in Cu, the Ni9Cu1 and Ni7Cu3 display the two obvious reduction peaks that is centered at 175–213 °C and 372–414 °C respectively. The peak centered at 372–414 °C can be assigned to the reduction of NiO that is dispersed on Al2O3, and the peak that is centered at 175–213 °C can be attributed to the reduction of the formed Ni-Cu alloy. It is clearly observed that the reduction of CuO species can be promoted through increasing the content of Ni in Ni-Cu alloy, indicating the strengthened dissociation ability of H2 with the doping of Ni into Cu and the occurring of hydrogen spillover over Al2O3 supported Ni-Cu alloy. With continuous increase the Cu content, the reduction peak of NiO species disappears with the formation of Ni-Cu alloy. These results indicated that Cu2+ can be reduced more easily than Ni2+ under similar conditions, and the reduced Cu can be used as a catalyst to promote the reduction of Ni2+ [28,29]. The stability of Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst is investigated in the hydrogenation of PA and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. By changing the reaction conditions, the conversion of the PA is controlled at round 50 %. After 5 cycles, only a slight decreases of PA conversion (from 54 % to 53 %), while the selectivity of phthalide still keeps at about 98 % without observing the obviously deactivation of catalysts. The recycled catalyst was characterized by using TEM. The TEM image of reused Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst shows the interplanar crystal spacing is about 0.181 nm which is nearly equal to the (200) crystal face of Cu (Fig. 4b), and no new phases formation is observed. HAADF-STEM shows the uniform distribution of Ni-Cu alloy on alumina carrier (Fig. 4c) without observing the aggregation. The results show that Ni9Cu1-Al2O3 catalyst has good stability for PA hydrogenation. 4 Conclusion In summary, we report a Cu-modified Ni/Al2O3 bimetallic alloy catalyst, which has low cost but good activity and stability for selective hydrogenation of PA. Under mild reaction conditions (at 200 °C, 3 MPa H2), the Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst shows an excellent PA conversion of 91 % and phthalide selectivity of 97 %. The high activity of the Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst can be attributed to the synergistic interaction of the two metals in alloy. The doping of Cu into Ni can suppress the hydrogenation activity of Ni to prevent the deep hydrogenation of phthalide, which efficiently realize the conversion of PA to phthalide. The effect of alloy is conductive to develop the bimetal catalysts, especially for low-cost alternatives for noble metal catalysts in the hydrogenation reaction.

The high efficiency of the Ni9Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst can be attributed to the electronic interaction of the two metals in NiCu alloy, which promotes the dissociation of H2 and suppresses the corrosion of alloy. This work reveals the electronic interaction between two metals, which provides a new avenue for rational design of alloy catalyst for selective hydrogenation of CO bonds.",
