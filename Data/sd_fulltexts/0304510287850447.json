A. K. DU PLESSIS*, P. SMULDERS and C. J. DU TOIT Department of Chemistry, Potchefstroom University for C.H.E., Potchefstroom 2520 (South Africa) (Received October 6, 1986; accepted January 13, 1987) Summary Tantalum(V) chloride in chloro benzene as solvent oligomerizes acet- ylene at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to benzene and polymers in the presence of ethylaluminium dichloride. To activate the tan- talum(V) chloride as a cyclotrimerization catalyst, the reduction of the tantalum(V) to a tantalum( III ^containing species is necessary. This reduc- tion is illustrated by using 2 mol sodium per mol tantalum or 2 mol ethyl- aluminium dichloride in the presence of acetylene. Another 2 mol ethylalu- minium dichloride must be added to associate with the reduced species to obtain maximum conversion of the acetylene. By the addition of copper(I) chloride to the system, it is possible to distinguish between the reduction and association steps. Introduction Phenylacetylene cyclotrimerizes in the presence of niobium(V) chloride as well as tantalum(V) chloride to 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-triphenylbenzene [1]. During the cyclotrimerization of phenylacetylene [2-4] in carbon tetrachloride at room temperature, two mol phenylacetylene react rapidly with 1 mol niobium(V) chloride. This is followed by an induction period and thereafter an intermediate forms which catalyzes the formation of 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-triphenylbenzene. An induction period was also found by Mantovani et al. [5] using Ni(CO)3[P(0 i-C3H7)3] in boiling benzene, but only the 1,2,4-triphenylbenzene formed. The constitution of the catalytic system influences the activity and selectivity of the reaction. Ligands have a steric and/or electronic influence on the metal atom used as a catalytic centre [6]. The reaction of phenyl- acetylene is spontaneous in the presence of niobium(V) chloride, but in the * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 106 case of niobium(V) bromide [3] the system must be activated by adding ethylaluminium dichloride. A molar ratio of Al/Nb = 4 is necessary to achieve maximum activity. The cyclotrimerization of acetylene in the presence of niobium(V) chloride [7, 8] commences spontaneously in chlorobenzene, but with tantalum(V) chloride ethylaluminium dichloride must be added to activate the system. In this work we examine the interaction between tantalum(V) chloride, acetylene and ethylaluminium dichloride to obtain further informa- tion about the activation of the system. Experimental The reactions were carried out at 22 C and atmospheric pressure ( 86 kPa) in a 50 cm3 flat-bottom reactor fitted with a side arm sealed with a silicon rubber septum. All the work was done under a dry N3 atmosphere. The tantalum(V) chloride solution in chlorobenzene, as well as the ethyl- aluminium dichloride solution, was introduced in the dry nitrogen-filled reactor by means of syringes. The total volume of the chlorobenzene in the reactor was always kept at 5.0 cm3, with a tantalum(V) chloride content of 2.3 X 10~4 mol. The reaction mixture was stirred with a Teflon-coated magnet. The acetylene was also introduced by a needle into the reactor, and the amount of acetylene absorbed was gravimetrically determined. The reaction of phenylacetylene was carried out in an infrared cell [9] and the decrease in concentration of this alkyne was followed by measuring the intensity of the =C H stretching vibration at 3300 cm\"1. After completion of the reaction, 0.05 cm3 water was added to the reaction mixture to destroy any catalytic activity. GLC measurements were undertaken with a Carlo-Erba 4100 gas chromatograph (column, 3% SE-30 on Chromosorb WAW, stainless steel 3 m X 2 mm). Identification of pro- ducts was done by GC/MS measurements. Results and discussion The cyclotrimerization of acetylene Niobium(V) chloride in chlorobenzene reacts spontaneously with acetylene at room temperature to form an active catalytic system for the trimerization of acetylene. If tantalum (V) chloride is used, however, the system must first be activated by using a cocatalyst such as ethylaluminium dichloride.

Maximum activity in the sense of mass acetylene converted is obtained at a molar ratio Al/Ta s 4, with a conversion of acetylene to benzene of 40%. With niobium(V) chloride and phenylacetylene, the acetylene reduces the niobium(V) chloride to a niobium(III) chloride species that acts as the active cyclization catalyst [3]. It is possible that the tantalum(V) chloride is also reduced by the acetylene, but that ethylaluminium dichloride is neces- sary to activate the system. The ethylaluminium dichloride does not act as a reducing agent as such, because no ethyl chloride could be detected in the product spectrum. The influence of sodium amalgam on the ethylaluminium dichloride/ tantalum(V) chloride/acetylene system Tantalum(V) compounds can be reduced to tantalum(III) by using magnesium [10] or sodium amalgam [11]. Sodium amalgam is added to the chlorobenzene solution of tanta- lum(V) chloride in the molar ratio Na/Ta = 2 and stirred until all the sodium has reacted. This system is not catalytically active if acetylene is now let into the reactor. Reduction of the tantalum(V) chloride is thus not the only condition necessary to activate the system. Ethylaluminium dichloride must still be added to cause cyclotrimerization of the acetylene. Several runs were made under the above-mentioned conditions, but each with a different Al/Ta mole ratio. The results are given in Fig. 2. The maximum conversion took place at an Al/Ta molar ratio lower than in the case where no sodium was added. A decrease in the ratio of Al/Ta of almost 2 units could be observed (see Figs. 1 and 2). The reduction of tan- 108 talum(V) chloride is a necessary step in the formation of the catalyst, but a certain degree of association between the tantalum species and the ethyl- aluminium dichloride [12] is still necessary after reduction to activate the system. The influence of copper(I) chloride on the ethylaluminium dichloride/ tantalum(V) chloride/acetylene system If copper(I) chloride is added to a tantalum(V) chloride/ethylalumin- ium dichloride system, the cyclization and oligomerization activity of acetylene is suppressed; but if additional ethylaluminium dichloride is added, the activity can be restored. To evaluate this phenomenon the following measurements were made. The solution of tantalum(V) chloride was added to dry copper(I) chloride and, after mixing them in an acetylene atmosphere, the ethyl- aluminium dichloride was added. The influence of the copper(I) content on the activity of the system at various Al/Ta molar ratios is illustrated in Fig. 3. 2 4 6 8 10 AI/To mole raljo Fig. 3.

Curve: Cu/Ta mole ratio: 2 2.0 3 3.0 4 3.7 5 4.5 Different stages during the reaction could be identified as the copper(I) chloride content increased. Initially, an increase of activity took place in all cases as the Al/Ta mole ratio increased from 0 to 2, regardless of the copper 109 content of the system. This may be visualized as an association between the ethylaluminium dichloride and the tantalum(V) chloride in the molar ratio 2:1. In the presence of acetylene, this tantalum(V) is reduced to tantalum- (III) to form a moderately active cyclotrimerization system. An increase in the Al/Ta molar ratio led to a plateau in the activity which depended on the copper(I) chloride content of the system. The ethylaluminium dichloride reacted with the copper(I) chloride [13] giving ethyl copper(I). Only after this reaction did the remaining ethylaluminium dichloride associate with the tantalum compound to form an active trimerization catalyst. During this stage, only 2 mol ethylaluminium dichloride per mol tantalum must be added to obtain maximum activity. The ethylaluminium dichloride participated in three distinct reactions: firstly, an association with tantalum(V) chloride, then a reaction with copper(I) chloride and lastly an association with the tantalum(III) com- pound to form the active catalyst. To evaluate the role that the acetylene played during the reaction, phenylacetylene was used because of its ease of handling and of product identification. The cyclotrimemation of phenylacetylene If phenylacetylene, a liquid at room temperature, is added to the tan- talum(V) chloride solution, cyclotrimerization occurs spontaneously without the addition of a cocatalyst such as ethylaluminium dichloride. The course of this reaction is much easier to follow with IR spectroscopic measurements than in the case of acetylene, which is a gas and also needs a cocatalyst to activate the system. The decrease in the concentration of phenylacetylene in the presence of tantalum(V) chloride in chlorobenzene was followed by IR measurements at 3300 cm\"1. The results are presented in Fig. 4. The concentration of phenylacetylene decreased regularly with time, with no indication of an induction period as found when niobium(V) chloride was used as catalyst [2] in carbon tetrachloride. In all cases, a sudden decrease in phenylacetylene concentration was observed as soon as the molar ratio C^fisC^CH/Ta decreased to 1/2. This increase in reaction rate was also observed when niobium(V) chloride was used as catalyst. After a certain reaction time, water (0.5 cm3) was added to the system to stop the reactions executed at 21 C. The content of the different pro- ducts formed was measured relative to internal standard 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Triphenylbenzene (the 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-isomers), formed during the reaction, and |3-chloroethenylbenzene, which formed as a hydrolysis product of the system, could also be detected. The product distribution with time is given in Fig. 5. The j3-chloroethenylbenzene is a hydrolysis product of a compound, probably Cl3Ta[(C6Hs)C=C(H)Cl]2, which formed as an insertion product between tantalum (V) chloride and phenylacetylene [3].

The difference in activity of the Ill tantalum compounds may be attributed to a difference in isomeric forms. The cis isomer forms the basis for the active catalyst, while the trans isomer is inactive. The influence of phenylacetylene on the ethylaluminium dichloride/tan- talum(V) chloride/acetylene system To study the influence of phenylacetylene on the activation of the trimerization of acetylene, the following procedure was followed. A certain amount of phenylacetylene was added to the solution of tantalum(V) chloride. After 20 min, the nitrogen atmosphere was replaced by acetylene. As soon as the solution was saturated with acetylene, ethyl- aluminium dichloride was added. It was found that maximum activity of the system was obtained 20 min after the addition of the phenylacetylene. The influence of the phenylacetylene and ethylaluminium dichloride on the conversion of the acetylene is shown in Fig. 6. 246 AI/To mole rotio Fig. 6. The influence of phenylacetylene on the activity of a tantalum(V) chloride/ ethylaluminium dichloride/acetylene system; A: total mass of products, B; mass benzene formed. C^HsCSCH/Ta mole ratio: 2 (curve 1), 3 (curve 2), 4 (curve 3). After addition of the phenylacetylene, a smaller Al/Ta molar ratio is necessary to obtain a maximum yield of the products. A minimum of phenyl- acetylene/Ta = 3 molar ratio is needed to obtain the lowest Al/Ta molar ratio of 3 required for maximum activity. One would expect that addition of phenylacetylene to the tantalum(V) chloride system should activate it, and that at least 3 mol phenylacetylene/ Ta would be necessary to do so. However, if acetylene is added after the addition of the phenylacetylene, ethylaluminium dichloride must still be added to activate the system. If the tantalum(V) chloride was reduced to the tantalum(III) species, as in the case with sodium as reducing agent, only 2 mol ethylaluminium dichloride/Ta would be necessary to obtain maximum activity. From Fig. 6, it is clear that instead of 2 mol, 3 mol ethylaluminium 112 dichloride/Ta is needed. This additional ethylaluminium dichloride is neces- sary to activate the inactive Cl3Ta[(C6Hs)C=C(H)Cl]2 species formed as the phenylacetylene is introduced. Conclusions In the activation of the tantalum catalyst, the tantalum(V) chloride must be reduced to a tantalum(III) species. The system reduced with sodium gives a more active catalyst, 20 X 103 g product per mol tantalum being formed in contrast with 10 X 103 g product per mol tantalum if only ethyl- aluminium dichloride is used. This can be ascribed to a difference between the tantalum(III) species that formed in the two cases; one possibility can be visualized as: Tads + 2Na > TaCIa and TaClg + 2C2HsAlCl2 + nC^ ' (C2Hs)2TaCl The further reaction of the tantalum(III) species with ethylaluminium dichloride can be prevented if copper(I) chloride is present, because at this stage the following reaction is preferred: CzHsAlCl; + CuCl > C^HsCu + Aids Only after all the copper(I) chloride has reacted, can the ethylaluminium dichloride react with the tantalum(III) species in such a way that 2 mol ethylaluminium dichloride associates with 1 mol tantalum compound. Under these conditions and in the presence of acetylene, the highest conversion of acetylene to benzene and other oligomers is obtained.
