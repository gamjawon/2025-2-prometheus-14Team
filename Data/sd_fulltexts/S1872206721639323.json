Herein, the ionic modulation of cobalt pentlandite coupled with nitrogen-doped bowl-like hollow carbon sphere is well designed on octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The robust Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V with iron replacing at the octahedron possesses prolonged metal sulfur bond and exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E 1/2 = 0.80 V vs. RHE) and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER, Ej = 10 = 1.53 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 mol/L KOH. Accordingly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode endows high energy efficiency (102 mW cm−2), and a microbial fuel cell achieves a high-power density (791 ± 42 mW m−2), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Graphical abstract The characteristics of octahedral and tetrahedral irons in cobalt pentlandite structures are discussed, recognizing that octahedral iron with prolonged bond length facilitates reversible oxygen reactions. Keywords Oxygen electrocatalysis Transition metal sulfide Nitrogen-doped carbon Pentlandite structure Zinc-air battery 1 Introduction Fuel cells are efficient and promising techniques dealing with excessive consumption of traditional fossil energy [1–4]. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a vital role in such renewable energy conversion, while kinetics sluggishness of both cleavage and formation of O–O bonds in oxygen-involved reaction steps cause slow electron transfer and extra energy consumption [5–8]. To date, Pt and IrO2 are born with extremely high activity towards catalyzing ORR and OER respectively with nonnegligible shortness of rare storage and poor durability [9,10]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop inexpensive and robust oxygen electrocatalysts as substitutions for the extensive application of fuel cells. Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) composed of d-orbital metal and unsaturated heteroatoms possess versatile characteristics and thus attract vast attention in recent years [11–16]. Especially, cobalt pentlandite is reported as diversified catalysts attributing to its special d-band structure characterized with coordinated cobalt atoms in Oh and distorted C3v symmetry environment [17–19]. The ligand field effect of S induces unpaired electrons of octahedral cobalt atoms to separate into t2g and eg bands at lower Fermi level [20,21]. Based on d-band theory, the closer movement of the d-band center towards the Fermi level results in more filling of the antibonding states and stronger bonding [22,23], which provides the possibility of further optimization on the electronic structure over cobalt pentlandite. Recently, the atom doping in Co9S8 has been reconsidered as an effective strategy to regulate the surface charge state of the Co site to enhance OER [23,24]. For example, the addition of phosphorus into Co9S8 nanocage enhanced electrical conductivity of Co9S8 and the intrinsic activity of OER by trapping positively charged proton [25]. Nevertheless, few reports discuss atomic modulation of cobalt pentlandite towards ORR. Normally, the ORR activity is affected by the bond length of the catalyst that connects with adsorption of oxygen molecule onto the surface during the first step [26–28], while cation replacement in cobalt pentlandite might move the position of the d-band center as well as the positively elongate bond length of Co9S8. Herein, we introduce iron (d 6) into the structure of cobalt pentlandite, where the occupied situation can occur in both octahedral and tetrahedral positions. Nitrogen-doped bowl-like hollow carbon spheres (NHCS) with large surface areas can serve as the highly conductive substrates to expose more active sites of Fe-Co pentlandite nanoparticles. The relationship between electrochemical performance towards reversible oxygen reaction of Fe-Co pentlandite coupled with nitrogen-doped carbon sphere (Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS) and their metal-sulfur bond lengths are systematically investigated, as the optimal one is applied in zinc-air battery and microbial fuel cell. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of NHCS Nitrogen doped hollow carbon sphere is prepared using a typically sequential heterogeneous nucleation process under 80 mL of ammonia alcoholic and aqueous solution with a ratio between ethanol and deionized water of 1:7. Besides, 0.3 g of resorcinol is added and stirred until dissolving. Next, 0.48 mL of 37 wt% formaldehyde and 2.8 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) are injected successively. Resorcinol-formaldehyde resin grows together with SiO2 spontaneously and forms a coating structure. 6 h later, another 0.75 mL of TEOS is added to the stirring solution. The reaction product is named RF@SiO2 and washed with deionized water after filtration in the next 20 h. After drying at 55 °C for 12 h, the RF@SiO2 is carbonized at 800 °C for 2 h under the protection of the nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, NHCS is harvested once the silica template is removed by heating with 6 mol/L of sodium hydroxide at 70 °C for 6 h. 2.2 Preparation of FexCo9–xS8-NHCSs, S-NHCSs and FexCo9–xS8 50 mg of above-mentioned NHCS, 9 mg of FeCl3·6H2O, and 63.5 mg of CoCl2·6H2O are compounded and dispersed in 80 mL of ethylene glycol in 40 min, then 76 mg of thiourea is added into the blend under ultrasound treatment of half hour. After that, the mixture is transferred into an oil bath surrounding at 160 °C for 20 h. After filtration and dry overnight, the obtained precursor is further calcinated at 800 °C for 2 h under protection of nitrogen atmosphere then transforms into Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V. The synthesis of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-II, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-III, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-IV, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII is similar with the only different preparation of molar ratio Fe and Co precursors of 1:71, 1:35, 1:17, 2:7, and 3:6 respectively. The precursors of Co9S8-NHCS (donated as Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-I) and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII, are adjusting with 0.3 mmol CoCl2·6H2O and a combination of 0.15 mmol CoCl2·6H2O and 0.15 mmol FeCl3·6H2O. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-I, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-II, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-III, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-IV, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII are abbreviated with “I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII”. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V after ORR stability test is abbreviated with “ORR-V”. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V after OER stability test is abbreviated with “OER-V”. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V after zinc-air battery test is abbreviated with “ZA-V”. For comparison, sulfur doped NHCS is prepared similarly to Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V without the addition of metal precursors and named S-NHCS. Various Fe x Co9–x S8 are obtained similarly with Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS except for the addition of NHCS. 2.3 Characterization The surface morphology and microstructure of the as-obtained samples are analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010-HR), while the crystal structures are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, PW3040/60 diffractometer) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The analysis of surface chemical state and electronic state of samples is conducted employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm is collected on Tristar II (Micrometrics) at 77 K. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method is employed to investigate the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples. Last, Raman spectra are carried out on a Raman spectrometer (JY, HR 800) on a 514 nm laser. 2.4 Electrochemical measurement 2.4.1 Electrode preparation The catalyst ink for electrode test is prepared as follow: 3 mg of catalyst powders are foremost ultrasonically dispersed in a mixture of 0.5 mL isopropanol and 0.5 mL DI water with the addition of 20 μL of Nafion® resin solutions (5.0 wt%) for half an hour. Afterwards, 5 μL of the dispersion is dropped onto either a rotating disk electrode or rotating ring-disk electrode (glassy carbon RDE or RRDE, both 0.126 cm2) and dries in the air until solvent evaporation and appearance of a desiccative homogeneous film. The mass loading density of both as-obtained materials and Pt/C catalyst on the electrodes is ∼0.119 mg cm−2. 2.4.2 Electrochemical testing Catalytic activity for ORR and OER of the composites is measured using a CHI 760D (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China) electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode system. A Hg/HgO electrode is used as the reference electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution (pH = 13) alkaline electrolyte. All electrode potentials measured in the three-electrode configuration were converted from Hg/HgO to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using equation (pH = 13): E (RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + 0.87V Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) is measured at the open circuit, which is set as initial voltage in A.C impedance. The high frequency is fixed as 500000 Hz and the amplitude is 5 mV. The RRDE data is collected on AMETEK Princeton Applied Research PMC 2000A electrochemical workstation. The electron transfer number (n) as well as H2O2 yield of aforementioned catalysts are evaluated throughout the ORR process via the RRDE method, the calculation of which is as following equations: n = 4 × I D/(I D + I R /N) H2O2(%) = 200 × I R/N/(I R/N + I D) Hereon, I D and I R were Faradic currents collected at disk and ring electrodes respectively, while N is the collection efficiency of the ring electrode, which was equivalent to 0.38. Faradic efficiency = I R/(N × I D) 2.4.3 MFC construction and operation 28-milliliter single chamber air-cathode MFCs are assembled using commercial carbon cloth (cut into 7 cm2) as the conductive material supporter for catalysts and microorganisms. 30 mg as-prepared catalysis loaded onto a heat-treated (400 °C for 30 min) carbon cloth serves as cathode with the assistance of 170 μL of Nafion® resin solutions, while bare one without further treatment is directly applied as the anode. The microorganisms are inoculated by the activated sludge collected from Pearl River downstream and cultivated in an incubator at 30 °C. Trace elements (12.5 mL L−1), vitamin solution (5 mL L−1), glucose (1 g L−1) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) constituted the culture solution, whereas PBS comprehends NH4Cl (0.31 g L−1), NaH2PO4·H2O (1.3 g L−1), Na2HPO4·3H2O (9.4 g L−1) and KCl (0.13 g L−1). The operation data of MFCs is recorded with a 16-channel data acquisition instrument (MPS 010602, Beijing). 2.4.4 Zinc-air battery construction and operation 28-milliliter single chamber air-cathode zinc-air battery is constructed using commercial carbon cloth (cut into 7 cm2) as the conductive material supporter for catalysts. 5 mg of catalysts is painted onto carbon cloth with a limited geometric area of 1 cm2 used as the air cathode. Zinc flat is applied as the anode. 6.0 mol/L KOH with 0.2 mol/L zinc acetate solution is used as the electrolyte. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis scheme of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Initially, precursors of resorcinol, formaldehyde, and tetraethyl orthosilicate are dispersed and spontaneously reacted in hydroalcoholic ammonia solution. During the homogeneous nucleation process, different condensation rates of SiO2 sphere and phenolic resin result in an encapsulation structure of RF@SiO2. The phenolic resin shell is then carbonized and transformed into nitrogen doped conductive carbon at 800 °C. The self-grown SiO2 template is removed by an alkali etching process, which leads to the collapse of the intact carbon structure and forms bowl-shaped NHCS. Fe x Co9–x S8 of pentlandite structure is ultimately anchored onto NHCS as the active center of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS. The powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared catalysts samples are shown in Fig. 2(a) , where the nominal formula Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs matches well with the cubic crystal structure (PDF#29-0484). The strongest diffraction peak indexed to (440) shift back and forth in terms of 2θ angles with the augment of Fe concentration in Fig. 2(b). According to the Bragg equation [29], Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs shift toward the larger 2θ angles due to the smaller ionic radius of low-spin Fe2+ (r = 0.61 Å) compared with that of Co2+ (r = 0.65 Å). This result suggests that Fe2+ mainly occupies the octahedral sites of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-II, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-III, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-IV, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V. However, as the incremental ratio of iron in precursors, the shift trend changes backward to the reduced 2θ angles, indicating that Co2+ at the tetrahedral sites are gradually replaced by Fe2+ for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII, because the ionic radius of high-spin Fe2+ (r = 0.78 Å) is larger than that of Co2+ (r = 0.745 Å). In reality, as the ratio of iron and cobalt is more than 1:8, impure crystal phases occur and indicate Fe0.8Co0.2S (PDF#97- 006-5544) and FeS (PDF#97-003-5010) of hexagonal structure of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII (Fig. S1). Chemical surroundings of catalysts with various molar ratios of Co and Fe are examined by high-revolution Co and Fe 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2(c)). The center peaks locate at the binding energy of 778.1 and 780.9 eV correspond to Co0 and Co2+, respectively [30], which are mainly attributed to the Co–Co bonds and Co–S bonds in the pentlandite structure. After introducing the Fe2+ component, the locations for peaks of Co0 continuously shift by 0.6 to 778.7 eV for Fe x Co9–x S8NHCS-VIII and in the meanwhile, those of Co2+ further shift by 0.8 to 781.7 eV. It should be noted that both atoms of the Co–Co bond are at tetrahedral positions and that the behavior of occupation of Fe2+ at octahedral situations induces interatomic interaction with cobalt at tetrahedron [22]. Owing to the strong auger effect of Co [31], the covered signals of Fe 2p are not present or unambiguous until those of Fe2+ are observed for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII (Fig. S2). The S 2p spectra of all samples are almost invariable except for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII (Fig. S3), where peaks of sulphide gradually faded since surface S2– is oxidized into SO4 2– under atmosphere [32,33]. The N 1s spectra of all samples are also provided and deconvoluted into pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and quaternary N (Fig. S4). The full Raman spectra were used to characterize the as-prepared materials (Fig. S5), where all samples demonstrate two characteristic peaks at about 1346 and 1591 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands of carbon shells [34]. The Raman peaks below 750 cm−1 are attributed to vibration modes of the metal element, corresponding to A 1g, E g and F 2g, while A 1g mode is assigned to the stretching metal–S bonds [35–37], which is further discussed in the later part of electrochemical performance. Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals the situation of iron in Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V in Fig. 2(d). The composite system is well fitted into Lorentzian line shape with an isomer shift of 0.35 mm s−1 and full width at half-height of 0.58 mm s−1, confirming that iron is low-spin Fe2+ in the pentlandite structure [38,39]. The scheme of iron doping in Co9S8 is proposed in Fig. 2(e). There are one-ninth of cobalt atoms at octahedral sites and eight of ninth of residuals in tetrahedron in a typical cobalt pentlandite structure. When the ratio of iron and cobalt does not exceed 1:8, Fe2+ of low-spin state occupies the octahedral sites priorly. Subsequently, scarce octahedral occupation of cobalt forces high-spin Fe2+ to replace Co2+ in the tetrahedral sites when the ratio of iron and cobalt surpasses 1:8. Morphologies and microstructures of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V were investigated via field-emission SEM and TEM. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V presents bowl-like structures with about 300–400 nm in diameter, in which pentlandite particles are anchored uniformly on the surface in Figs. 3(a–c) . The BET surface area of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is 373.6 m2 g−1, smaller than the substance NHCS of 707.2 m2 g−1 (Figs. S6, S7). The SEM images of Co9S8-NHCS and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs are also displayed (Fig. S8). The TEM image in Fig. 3(d) clearly reveals the size distribution of the particles ranging from 6 to 37 nm (Figs. S9–S11). The microstructure of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V was further investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Fig. 3(e), where the interplanar lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.30 and 0.17 nm correspond to (311) and (440) crystal planes of Co8Fe1S8 of cubic structure. In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V in Fig. 3(f) is in consistence with (311), (331), and (440) lattice planes. The ORR and OER performances of all samples in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution are analyzed using linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs). In Fig. 4(a) , Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V exhibits superb ORR performance among Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs, meanwhile superior to Co9S8-NHCS and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII. The kinetic current density of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is –4.93 mA cm−2 at 0.72 V, close to that of Pt/C of –5.01 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII show relatively low limited current densities (~4 mA cm−2). To further explore the dynamic transfer process, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V was evaluated using rotating ring-disk electrodes (RRDE) (Fig. S12), where the calculated number of electron transfer and associated production yield of hydrogen peroxide of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V are 3.84% and 8.16%, respectively, similar to those of Pt/C (3.82% and 8.85%, respectively). Subsequently, the OER performance of catalysts is shown in Fig. 4(b), where the catalytic activity significantly enhances after the introduction of element Fe into Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs. The acquired potentials to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 are mainly between 1.53 V and 1.63 V for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs, among which Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V exhibits the best performance in LSV, even 20 mV lower than the IrO2 benchmark at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (1.55 V). Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII exhibits a low catalytic activity, similar to Co9S8-NHCS. The Tafel slopes derived from both ORR and OER LSV curves are also presented (Figs. S13, S14). The relationship between the Fe content of the samples and Tafel slopes is also displayed in Fig. 4(c). As the composition x (Fe) in Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS augments from 0 to 1, the peaks of A1g mode of Raman shift from 673 to 665 cm−1 in Fig. 4(d), which is ascribed to that low-spin Fe2+ is gradually stabilized with negative sulfur donors by ligand field and gives rise to the elongation of metal–S bond length [22,40]. Normally, the prolonged bond length is beneficial to ORR performance with higher electron density and shrink of the energy gap between highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) [41]. The Tafel slopes of ORR exhibits an obviously reducing trend and optimization of the kinetics. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V possesses the most favorable kinetics during oxygen reduction reaction with the smallest Tafel slope of 55.75 mV dec−1. However, when the composition x (Fe) in Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS increases from 1 to 4.5, the blue shift of breathing A1g occurs, which is related to the replacement of high-spin Fe2+ in tetrahedral sites with repulsion effects on coordinated environment [42]. The Tafel slope of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI rebounds to 70.01, implying that the additional tetrahedral replacement of iron on the pentlandite structure has an influence on oxygen reduction in comparison to that of individual octahedral sites. In addition, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII and Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII exhibit abnormally lower Tafel slope (Table S1), which may be attributed to the few mixed phases. Smaller Tafel slopes of OER are observed with increasing the composition x (Fe) in Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS (Table S2), regardless of the iron replacement situation of tetrahedron or octahedron. The potential gap between Ej = 10 and E 1/2 is an important parameter for evaluating reversible oxygen reaction activity [41]. Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V exhibits the smallest gap of 0.728 V among all samples, smaller than the potential gap (0.736 V) between E 1/2 of Pt/C and Ej = 10 of IrO2. (Fig. S15). The double layer capacitance (C dl) is measured via the CV method to investigate the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the samples above (Figs. S16, S17, and Table S3). As iron replaces the octahedral situation on the pentlandite structure, a larger C dl value implies a higher ECSA, and thus exposing more active sites of the catalysts, especially for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V (2.45 mF cm−1). On the contrary, increasing replacement of tetrahedral sites of iron on the pentlandite structure is against exposure of surface-active sites, resulting in the inferior performance of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VI, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VII, and even Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-VIII during the ORR and OER process. ORR as well as OER performance of NHCS and S-NHCS are significantly lower than that of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs (Fig. S18), suggesting that the enablers of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCSs are from Fe-Co pentlandites. Moreover, for further investigation of electrical resistivity of Fe-Co pentlandite, EIS are conducted under open circuit potential (Fig. S19 and Table S4). The semi-circuits of all synthesized samples (without NHCS) in high frequency region are attributed to charge transfer resistance (R ct) of their intrinsic activity. Apparently, the R ct of Fe x Co9–xXS8-V electrode shows an ultra-low value of 2.78 Ω cm−2, significantly lower than other Fe x Co9–x S8 samples as well as Co9S8, indicating that the replacement of low-spin Fe2+ extremely improve electrical resistivity of cobalt pentlandite. The chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometry responses are conducted to appraise the durability of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V compared with noble metal (Fig. 4(e) and Fig. S20). Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V exhibits predominant ORR stability performance (~12.3% current loss at 0.5 V after 40 h test), outperforming Pt/C with current loss of 21.5% after 14 h. The increment of OER overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is about 25 mV, better than that of IrO2 (increment 93 mV). To further assess whether the current is measured due to oxidation of water or Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V, RRDE is conducted in N2-saturated alkaline solution at 1600 rpm with E disk (E j = 10 mA cm−2) of 1.53 V and E ring of 0.5 V. The result is presented in Fig. 4(f) where the calculated Faradaic efficiency of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is from 92.5% to 96.1%. For further estimate actual application of the Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V catalysts, the samples are loaded onto carbon cloth as the oxygen cathode and assembled into a home-made zinc-air battery. In practice, the open circuit potential of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is 1.46 V, slightly higher than that of the noble metal Pt/C and IrO2 compound of 1.41 V (Fig. 5(a) ). A Timer is driven using a zinc-air battery with Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode as the power source (Fig. S21). Fig. 5(b) exhibits the charging and discharging polarization curves of the battery, where a smaller voltage gap is obtained for Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V compared with the combination of noble metals, consistent with the excellent reversible oxygen redox ability. Besides, the Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V battery possesses a lower charging voltage than that of Pt/C & IrO2 one at the same charging current density. Power density is calculated from the discharging polarization plots in Fig. 5(c). The battery made of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode realizes a power density of 102 mW cm−2, higher than that of Pt/C & IrO2 cathode (93.2 mW cm−2). Cycling performance at 20 mA cm−2 is executed to evaluate the liability as long-term charging and discharging in continual working conditions (Fig. 5(d)). The voltage gap at first is calculated to be 0.81 V for the Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode battery. Notably, the voltage gap shrinks into 0.80 V after the 28-h operation, on account that sulfide transfers into oxyhydroxide partly and that charging voltage declined 0.01 V. Ultimately, the voltage gap expands to 0.89 V after the operation time is prolonged to 96 h. The voltage gap of Pt/C & IrO2 cathode is measured to be 0.88 V at the very start. However, the performance suffers from enormous degradation and the voltage gap enlarges and manifests 1.2 V after 28 h. Sulfide species are easily oxidized during the OER process [43,44]. Thus, for better understanding surface changes of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V after electrochemical reaction, the XPS are further investigated after oxygen redox reaction stability test and zinc-air battery cyclic performance test in Fig. 6 . The High-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p reveals that no observable shift of peaks is shown before and after ORR. However, little variation of intensity of Co0 and Co2+ at 778.1 and 780.9 eV in Fig. 6(a), suggesting that charge redistribution occurs around Co and both octahedral and tetrahedral Co element makes a difference on the part of the surface after long-run ORR process. The peak pattern of Fe 2p in Fig. 6(b) further supports the point above, though the auger signal of Co is too strong to further analyze the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p in detail. The disappeared deconvoluted peaks of sulfide and relatively stronger SO x species signal of S 2p in Fig. 6(c) further confirm the change of the Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V surface. As for the OER stability and zinc-air battery cyclic performance test, spectra of Co 2p show evident valence state distribution that deconvoluted peak of Co0 exists in neither situation, implying the oxidation of metallic Co in tetrahedral sites. Instead of the deconvoluted peak of Co2+ at 780.9 eV, a distinct red-shift of the main peak to 779.9 eV in Co 2p 3/2 indicates the Co species transform into characteristic CoOOH on the surface during the oxygen revolution process, which is in line with the previously reported cobalt sulfide catalysts [45,46]. Furthermore, there is no significant distinction of high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p between the OER stability test and zinc-air cycling one in the binding energy position or shape of the peak, and neither of that of Fe 2p, indicating immigration and emigration of Zn2+ have little influence on superficial CoOOH during charging. It is worth noting that a barely weak signal of S 2p is detected after the OER stability test, which might be a dissolution of sulfur species suffered from the oxidation, or partial loss of them into the electrolyte. Nevertheless, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p after zinc-air battery cycling reserves deconvoluted peaks of sulfide and SO x species, manifesting that discharging behavior in zinc-ion rich strong basic electrolyte helps reducing loss of sulfur species, which might be the key of the superior durability of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode zinc-air battery. Deconvoluted M-O peaks ulteriorly favour the above conclusion that obviously strong signal at about 529.9 eV shows clearly the formation of oxyhydroxides on the surface during the tests, while a larger proportion of S–O peak at about 532.6 eV remains after cycling test in the zinc-air battery. Other deconvoluted peaks at appropriate 531.3 eV are attributed to adsorption oxygen species on the CoOOH surface. Finally, Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V is also used as the cathode catalyst and assembled into microbial fuel cells referred to Pt/C. Fig. 7(a) is a schematic diagram of the MFC device. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the output voltage of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode MFC maintained above 0.4 V during 30 cycles, slightly higher than that of commercial Pt/C cathode. The cathode polarization curve under the last cycle is tested and the power density was calculated. In Figs. 7(c) and (d), the maximum power density of the Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode MFC was 791 ± 42 mW m−2, which was higher than that of the commercial Pt/C of 699 ± 9 mW m−2. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have successfully developed a hybrid iron modulated cobalt pentlandite catalyst Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS with high activity and long-term durability for both ORR and OER, outperforming those of noble metals. Octahedral substitution for iron strengthens the bond length between metal and sulfur in Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS, which is beneficial to reversible oxygen reaction, while extra iron replacement of tetrahedral situation inversely impacts the catalytic activity. This work not merely proposes a new strategy to synthesize highly efficient catalysts, but also provides significant insights into the promotion of oxygen electrocatalysis on the pentlandite-based structure.

        "dc:description": "Reversible oxygen reaction plays a crucial role in rechargeable battery systems, but it is limited by the slow reaction kinetics. Herein, the ionic modulation of cobalt pentlandite coupled with nitrogen-doped bowl-like hollow carbon sphere is well designed on octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The robust Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V with iron replacing at the octahedron possesses prolonged metal sulfur bond and exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E 1/2 = 0.80 V vs. RHE) and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER, Ej = 10 = 1.53 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 mol/L KOH. Accordingly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery of Fe x Co9–x S8-NHCS-V cathode endows high energy efficiency (102 mW cm−2), and a microbial fuel cell achieves a high-power density (791 ± 42 mW m−2), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.",
