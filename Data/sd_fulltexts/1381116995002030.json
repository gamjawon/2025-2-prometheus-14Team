Bautista, J.M. Campelo, A. Garcia, R. Guarde, D. Luna *, J.M. Marinas Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Cdoba, San Alberto Magno Av., E-14004 Cordoba, Spain Received 14 December 1993; revised 10 April 1995: accepted 16 August 1995 Abstract The role of Cu in Sepiolite-supported bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts has been evaluated through the results obtained in a kinetic study on the influence of temperature in the consecutive hydrogenation of ethyl linolate to ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate, respectively. Liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions (individual and consecutive) were carried out under hydrogen pressure of 0.41 MPa in a temperature range between 305 and 337 K. Thus, the relative reactivities of linoleic and oleic ethyl esters, Rt-,o, as well as the corresponding relative adsorption constants, KL,o, were obtained at all temperatures studied. According to the results, in both of the Sepiolite supported catalysts studied, selectivity values steadily increased with temperature in the interval studied. Besides, RL,0 and KL,o exhibited an Arrhenius type law with temperature that enabled us to obtain several kinetic parameters affecting the selectivity of the consecutive hydrogenation process and closely related to the electronic density of supported nickel which is modified by Ni-Cu alloying.

Introduction In previous papers we concluded that Sepiolite, a hydrous magnesium silicate: Sit2Mg8032 - nHz0 [ I ] , could be not only an acid catalyst [ 2-6 ] , an excellent support in I'd and Rh hydrogenation catalysts [ 7-9 ] , but also an adequate support component [ 10] to enable tailored Ni-Cu catalysts to be used in oil and fat hydrogenation by taking into account its comparatively lower cost as well as the fact that the Ni-Cu alloy exhibits substantially higher selectivity than monometallic supported nickel catalysts, including some commercial catalysts also studied. * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$09.50 996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSD11381-1169(95)00203-0 Thus, liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of ethyl linolate to ethyl oleate was carried out on nickel and Ni-Cu catalysts supported on Sepiolite as well as on several different supports. The results indicated that catalytic activity and selectivity correlated closely with some textural and/or acidbase properties of the support. Furthermore, regardless of which support was used, the highest selectivity obtained > 98% was always closely related to the presence of Cu as a second metal, especially when Ni-Cu was in the proportion 200.3. Besides, catalytic activity was lower in bimetallic catalysts. The present paper evaluates the role of Cu in Sepiolite-supported bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts 230 F.M. Bautista et al. /Journal elf Molecular Catalvsis A: Cheinical 104 (1996) 229-235 through the results obtained in a kinetic study on temperature influence in the consecutive hydrogenation of ethyl linolate to ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate using the best mono and bimetallic catalysts previously described [ 10]. Taking into account that linoleie (cis-9, cis-12-octadecadienoic), oleic (cis-9-octadecenoic) and stearic (octadecanoic) acids are the major constituents of fatty acids in olive oil, this report study the potential use of these clay supported Ni-Cu catalysts in production-scale oils hydrogenation. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The syntheses and characterization of both Ni and Ni-Cu supported catalysts used in this work were previously described [ 10]. A natural Sepiolite, from Vallecas (Madrid) supplied by Tolsa S.A., was as received used as support. They were as reported elsewhere [ 11-16] prepared by impregnation of the Sepiolite to incipient wetness with aqueous solutions of nickel or nickel and copper. Then, they were dried, crushed and screened to particle size < 0.149 mm, reduced in an ultrapure hydrogen stream (1.7 CM3 s-') at 673 K for 3 h, and then cooled to room temperature in the same hydrogen stream. Final metal loadings were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry and the corresponding metal surface areas were determined from the average crystallite diameter obtained by X-ray diffraction measurements assuming that nickel particles are monocrystalline [ 9 ] . Thus, Ni/Sepiolite catalyst exhibited 39.4 wt% Ni weight while Ni-Cu/Sepiolite had 18.5 wt% Ni and 0.3 wt% Cu. Their corresponding nickel surface areas were 24 and 77 (m2 gN; -') , respectively. 2.2. Apparatus, materials and procedure According to the procedure previously employed [ 10-16] hydrogenation runs were per- formed in a conventional low pressure hydrogenator (Parr Instr. Co., Md. 3911) at controlled pressure and temperature conditions. Ethyl linolate and ethyl oleate (Fluka p.a.) hydrogen (99.999%, S.E.O.) and solvent methanol (99%, Panreac) were used without further purification. Most hydrogenation reactions (individual and consecutive) were carried out in 25 ml of 0.5 M methanolic solution of substrate under hydrogen pressure of 0.41 MPa with 0.3 g of catalyst and temperature range between 305 and 337 K. In order to test the lack of mass transfer limitations in the range of the operation variables studied, one set of reactions was carried out in the pressure range of 0.3-0.7 MPa, substrate concentration of 0.5-3 M and catalyst weight range of 0.05-1 g. The initial reaction rate was calculated by taking the initial slope of the plot of the hydrogen pressure decrease on the manometer versus time. The consecutive reactions were followed by GLC with FID and a column packed with 10% ethylene glycol succinate in 80/ 100 Chromosorb GAWDMCS, analyzing the reaction mixtures at appropriate intervals of hydrogen uptake. 3. Results and discussion Several hydrogenation runs, performed at various agitation regimes and with different amounts of catalysts, showed that the initial rate of hydrogenation was directly proportional to the catalyst weight and not affected by the shaking regime above 200 strokes min-' so that we can assume the absence of external diffusion control. The internal diffusion was excluded by using catalysts with a enough small grain diameter, lower than 0.149 mm. Experiments carried out at standard conditions with catalysts of several grain sizes showed that reaction rates decreases when the grain size is greater than 0.21 mm so that internal diffusion limiting the rate of hydrogenation [ 17,18 ] is excluded when the grain size is lower than 0.21 mm. Thus, the kinetic data obtained in the range of the operation variables studied are free from transport influences as previously F.M.

Blank experiments over pure supported 0.7 and 24 wt% Cu catalysts did not exhibit any catalytic activity under the present experimental conditions. Furthermore, the hydrogenation rates for both substrates, ethyl linolate and ethyl oleate, under the present standard conditions at 323 K were zero order in substrate concentration as well as in hydrogen pressure in the ranges studied, so that the initial reaction rates rL and rt) reported in Table 1 and Table 2 can be directly used as the reaction constant values to obtain (Fig. 1) the corresponding apparent activation energies, Ea, and Arrhenius constant, In A, collected in Table 3.

They are easily obtained from the point of interception (I point) of the distribution plots of the reactant and products in the course of the consecutive hydrogenation shown in Fig. 1 (a). This value C C is used instead of CL and C respectively, and is in an equimolecular proportion as Cvalues are habitually employed in a competitive process [ 20-22 ] . Thus, this equation takes into account the additional concentration of O present in the reaction as a consequence of the transformation L -j O, which is evaluated as C- CO, when there are not any secondary reactions, as obtained under the present experimental conditions. From the results of the consecutive process shown in Fig. 2 (a), the straight line shown in Fig. 2 (b) was obtained. The values of relative reactivity, RL,o, for both catalysts at the different temperatures studied were determined from the slopes of the straight lines obtained in their loglog plots according to Eq. ( 2 ) . They are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 where KL,o values, obtained from RL,o and the corresponding individual hydrogenation rates, rL and ro, are also collected in Table 1 and Table 2. Besides, if we consider that both consecutive ( and competitive) reactions exhibit the zero reaction order, the linearity of the plot in Fig. 2 (b) can be taken as evidence of the validity of the theoretical treatment [ 20-22 ] . Due to the fact that relative reactivity, RL,o, is an index of the hydrogenation reactivity of linoleic ethyl ester compared to that of oleic ethyl ester, high F. M.

( b) Logarithmic plot of the disappearance of ethyl linolate respect to ethyl oleate according to Eq. 2. values of this parameter are consistent with the high selectivity, S, also shown in Table 1 and Table 2, obtained from the relative concentration of L with respect to ( O + L ) at a very low concentration of L [ 23 ] . According to Eq. (2), RL,O values are determined by two components, the ratio of the initial reaction rates rLlro and the relative adsorption constant values, KL,o. In this respect, the high RL,O (and also S) in the Ni/Sepiolite catalyst is explained by its higher rLlro value while in the bimetallic Ni-Cu/Sepiolite catalyst, it can be associated with the higher value in KL,o. Consequently, the influence of Cu as a second metal in selectivity is closely related to its influence in the KL,o parameter which may be associated with metal-support interaction effects of an electronic character. In this respect, the increased KL,o values for the Ni-Cu alloy may be interpreted as a consequence of the increased electronic density of the Ni d-band, which may be ascribed to an electronic transfer from Cu to Ni, according to the results previously described with bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts in the consecutive hydrogenation of propargyl alcohols [ 15 ] as well as with platinum and other Group VIII metals in the competitive hydrogenation of toluene with respect to benzene [ 2426]. In this respect, for a pair of hydrocarbons F.M. Bautista et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical /04 (/996) 229-235 with different electronic structure, any change in the electronic structure of the surface metal sites resulted in a modification of the relative adsorption constant values, showing a higher degree of sensitivity than that obtained by using physical techniques [ 25,26 ] . The role of Cu may be better understood taking into account the changes produced in RL.o and KL.o with temperature. Thus, in both the sepiolite supported catalysts studied, selectivity values steadily increased with temperature in the interval studied (Table 1 and Table 2) . Besides, RLO and KL,o exhibited an Arrhenius type law with temperatures that let us obtain several kinetic parameters. According to Tanaka and Chihara [ 27 ] , changes in RL and KL,o with temperature may be expressed by the relationships: d(ln RL,o) R d(1/T) -: -(EaL-Eao) (4HL s-4Hpy -. -(EaL+4HLds) + (Eao+4H) - -4E(true)L.o R In KL,o=4S4H',T- (4) where R is the gas constant, 4SadsL'o and 4HadsL.o are, respectively, the differential entropy and differential adsorption heat (or enthalpy, negative values for exothermic) of adsorption between ethyl linolate and ethyl oleate on the catalyst surface. Taking into account that Ea, apparent activation energies, is the energy required for bringing a substrate in the bulk solution up to the activation state on the catalyst surface, the quantity (Ea + 4 Hads) represents the energy required for bringing the adsorbed substrate to the activated state or `true activation energy'. Besides, while in an individual zero-order hydrogenation reaction all active sites are occupied by the reactant molecules [ 28 ] , in a competitive (or consecutive) hydrogenation process the whole surface active sites are also occupied but by both reactants ( O 233 or L, in the present case) in the proportion corresponding to the RL,o value [29,30]. In this respect, according to the results previously obtained [ 14,15 ] , we find that the dependence of RL,o on temperature is determined by the difference between the true activation energy of the two substrates, 4E(tr,e)L.o. All these activation parameters obtained from Eqs. (3) and (4) are collected in Table 3. According to these results, we have to remark on the coincidental results obtained between the values of 4 E(true) L,o directly obtained from the slope of the Arrhenius plot in Eq. (3) and those from Ea and 4HadSL,o calculated by the derived expression of Eq. (3) ds (EaL-Ea0) +4HL.o=4E'(true)L.o (5) Values of 20.4 and 7.9 (kJ/mol) thus obtained, for Ni/Sepiolite and Ni-Cu/Sepiolite, are very close to the 20.7 and 8.0 collected in Table 3. On the other hand, the electronic influence of Cu promoting such an important change in the differential adsorption heat of the two substrates, (3) 4 HadsL'o, ought to be considered as being mainly responsible for the selectivity improvement pro moted by the addition of this element to supported nickel catalysts because it is this adsorption kinetic parameter that experiments the highest change. Thus, negative value for 4H'dsL'o indi cates that 4HadsL < 4Hadso in Ni/Sepiolite while the opposite is true in Ni-Cu/Sepiolite, consid ering the positive value obtained for this param eter. Thus, taking into account that enthalpy negative values indicate an exothermic process, ethyl linolate is adsorbed more strongly than ethyl oleate in Ni/sepiolite. The electronic influence of the Ni-Cu alloy promotes the strongest adsorption of ethyl oleate. Besides, changes obtained in dif ferential entropy values, jSadsL.0, are compara tively less important. According to the results, we may conclude that by using RL,o and KL,o parameters obtained at different temperatures, it is possible to obtain valuable information concerning parameters affecting the selectivity of the consecutive hydrogenation process and closely related to the electronic density (or level) of supported nickel 234 FM. Bautista et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (1996) 229-235 which is modified by Ni-Cu alloying. Thus, on the basis of these results and according to previous papers [ 15,19 ] , an increase in electronic density in supported nickel promotes a variable increase in KL,o joined to a variable decrease in r,_,/ro. Finally, we have also to conclude that Cu addition to a supported Ni catalyst promote changes in catalytic activity and selectivity due to the influence of Ni-Cu alloying in the electronic structure of the Ni d-band as well as in the `ensemble effect', associated with the geometric structure of active sites. The former would be associated with changes in enthalpy parameters such as 4HadsL,o, while the latter will be better related to changes in entropy ones such as 4 SadsL,o. Thus, taking into account the important changes obtained in 4HadsL,O values by the Ni-Cu alloying with respect to those obtained in dSad,o, results obtained here are more in agreement with the viewpoint of Burch [ 31 ] or Somorjai [ 32 ] than with the opinion of Ponec [ 33,34 ] or Martin [ 35 ] with respect to the prevailing role of electronic against geometric or ensemble effects in determining the catalytic behavior of Ni-Cu bimetallic alloys. However, the decrease of activity obtained in Table 1 and Table 2 when Cu is added to Ni can be therefore accounted for primarily in terms of geometric or ensemble effects, assuming an important decrease in the number of active sites on nickel surface associated to the production of different structural defects on nickel crystallites. These structural defects of supported-nickel crystallites such as `twin faults', `stacking faults' and `microstrains' were obtained by X-ray diffraction line broadening analysis in a previous work[ 19] . According to the clearly different 4H# values for L and O, Ni/Sepiolite could have two kinds of active sites with different electronic density. Cu addition seems to avoid the action of the most active ones, according to the similar values of 4H# (and Ea) in L and O in Ni-Cu catalyst, both also nearly coincidental with 4HL in Ni catalyst. This drastic reduction in the number of active sites is also responsible of the important decrease in rL and ro values. However, only identical values of 4H# (and Ea) could be explained by a `pure' topological or ensemble hypothesis, because in such a case, it is obtained a variable reduction in the number of active sites but its energetic is not changed at all. Differences obtained in 4H# (and Ea) must be associated to electronic Ni-Cu interaction effects. Thus, Ni-Cu alloying as well as metal support interaction effects may be explained within the framework of a simultaneous action of electronic and structural or geometric effects.

Bautista J.M. Campelo A. Garcia R. Guardeño D. Luna ∗ J.M. Marinas Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Córdoba, San Alberto Magno Av., E-14004 Cordoba, Spain ∗ Corresponding author. The role of Cu in Sepiolite-supported bimetallic NiCu catalysts has been evaluated through the results obtained in a kinetic study on the influence of temperature in the consecutive hydrogenation of ethyl linolate to ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate, respectively. Liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions (individual and consecutive) were carried out under hydrogen pressure of 0.41 MPa in a temperature range between 305 and 337 K. Thus, the relative reactivities of linoleic and oleic ethyl esters, R L,O, as well as the corresponding relative adsorption constants, K L,O, were obtained at all temperatures studied. According to the results, in both of the Sepiolite supported catalysts studied, selectivity values steadily increased with temperature in the interval studied. Besides, R L,O and K L,O exhibited an Arrhenius type law with temperature that enabled us to obtain several kinetic parameters affecting the selectivity of the consecutive hydrogenation process and closely related to the electronic density of supported nickel which is modified by NiCu alloying.
