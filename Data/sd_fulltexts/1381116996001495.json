The type of tin compound used for the preparation of the bimetallic catalysts was important for the hydrogenation activity. The effective materials were K,SnO, and Na,SnO, for the hydrogenation of -C=O. Keywords: Ruthenium; Tin: Hydrogenation ; Rosin; Industrial use Catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acids or its esters on supported bimetallic catalyst has been discussed in many reports. For example, Basset et al. [I] have reported the hydrogenation of ethyl acetate by using Rh-Sn catalyst. The authors [2] have reported that C=O in methyl oleate dimer was hydrogenated to alcohol by using Rh-Sn catalyst. Mizukami et al. [3] have reported the hydrogenation of oleic acid to 9-oc- tadecen- l-01 by using Ru-Sn catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method. Here we examine the hydrogenation of rosin which is an essentially abietic acid to the corre- sponding useful rosin alcohol on the industrial * Corresponding author. level. The reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 1. The sol-gel method by Mizukami [3] and the method using organometallic compounds by Basset [l] are not readily adaptable for practical applications to industrial processes. We report herein the hydrogenation of rosin to rosin alco- hol by using Ru-Sn catalyst prepared by im- pregnation by the use of a nontoxic Sn com- pound in a heterogeneous system in the liquid phase, and the effects of the type of Sn com- pound used. Alumina was soaked in an aqueous solution of K,SnO,. The mixture was aged for 12 h at room temperature, and dried. The powder ob- tained was soaked in a 2-propanol solution of Ru(NO)(NO,),. The mixture was aged for 12 h at room temperature, and dried. The powder 1381-I 169/96/$15.00 Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved PII S1381-1169(96)00149-5 L6 K. Tahara et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 110 (1996) L54.6 obtained was reduced in a hydrogen stream at 450 for 2 h and cooled in a nitrogen atmo- sphere. The hydrogenation reaction of rosin was car- ried out in a 300 ml autoclave. The reactor was charged with 30 g of rosin as a reactant, 3 g of catalyst, and 57 g of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether as a solvent. The hydrogenation reaction of rosin was performed at 260 under 100 kg/cm* of H, for 6 h. After the catalyst had been filtered off, the solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, then the remaining reaction products were ana- lyzed on the basis of the acid value and the hydroxyl value. These values defined in the Japanese Industrial Standard, KOO70 (1966). We have prepared Ru-Sn catalysts by a con- ventional impregnation method using various tin compounds to hydrogenate rosin. Results are shown in Table 1. The Ru-&r/alumina catalyst prepared from (Bu,Sn),O gave a high yield of rosin alcohol (80%) on the hydrogenation of rosin (Table 1, Run 1). Unfortunately, organic tin compounds are highly toxic; thus they are not suitable for in- dustrial use. We tried inorganic tin compounds as nontoxic alternatives. Though SnCl, showed very little yield (22%, Run 2), the catalysts prepared from tin octoate, K,SnO, and Na,SnO, showed higher yield than the catalyst prepared from SnCl,.

On the catalyst prepared from SnCl,, Cl was detected by EDX analysis. On the other hand, no Cl was detected on the catalyst prepared from tin octoate, K,SnO,, and Na,SnO,. As is generally known, Cl can be a poison to noble metal catalysts on alumina. Chlorine would inhibit the hydrogenation activ- ity of -C=O. The catalyst prepared from K,SnO, and Na,SnO, showed higher yields than the catalyst prepared from tin octoate. In the catalyst prepared from K,SnO, and Na,SnO,, K and Na were detected by EDX analysis, respectively. On the other hand in the catalyst prepared from tin octoate, no alkaline metal was detected. The alkaline metal might affect the hydrogena- tion activity of -C=O. The effective materials were K,SnO, and Na,SnO, for the hydrogena- tion of -C=O, which can be prepared catalyst in industrial use. References [l] O.A. Ferreti, J.P. Bournonville, G. Mabilon, G.
