Summary A detailed structural study of cobalt particles in a 9.5%Co-ZSM-5 catalyst was made using X-ray diffraction and analytical transmission elec- tron microscopy. The results obtained from these two techniques show that the cobalt particles contain a high concentration of basal plane stacking faults. On the average one out of every 12 basal planes is faulted. It is sug- gested that atoms of a particle which lie at positions on the surface where intersection stacking faults exist may be the origin of active sites. Introduction The characterization of catalytic materials by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy presents unique problems. The small metallic particles and relatively small metal volume fractions make it diffi- cult to obtain well-defined X-ray diffraction spectra. The weak Bragg reflec- tions are broadened considerably due to small particle effects. If the support material is amorphous, it has been possible to obtain good X-ray diffraction data on nickel and platinum catalysts [1, 2]. However, if the support mate- rial is crystalline, as in the case of zeolite supports, the spectrum from the catalyst is a mixture of the spectra from the crystalline support and the metallic phase. The spectrum from the support is strong and overpowers the broadened spectrum from the small metallic particles. However, the exact spectrum from the metallic phase can be obtained by employing a Fourier unfolding technique [3]. A number of serious problems are encountered when catalytic materials are investigated using conventional transmission electron microscopy. Among these are: excessive heating of the metallic phase to the point of melting and vaporization; the limit of resolution of most microscopes out- fitted for general materials science research is not adequate for revealing the 0304-6102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 302 morphology and defect structure existing in small metallic particles (less than 10 nm). To obtain the detailed information requires the ability to obtain selected area diffraction patterns from individual particles by op- erating in the microdiffraction mode. The objective of this work was to show that by employing Fourier X-ray diffraction spectrum unfolding techniques information concerning the detailed structure of cobalt particles supported on ZSM-5 can be obtained. These details are then shown to correlate exceptionally well with direct structural observations of single particles made on an analytical transmission electron microscope. Materials and Experimental Procedures The 9.5% cobalt on ZSM-5 support catalyst samples were obtained by solution impregnation of cobalt nitrate on to the support. The ZSM-5 ma- terial was ca. 70% crystalline. The as-produced catalyst was calcined at 200 C for 2 h in air to produce cobalt oxide (304). The calcined material was ground using a hand mortar and pestle and pressed into a 24 mm diam- eter and 3 mm thick disk and placed into an in situ X-ray camera on a Picker X-ray diffractometer fitted with a graphite crystal diffracted beam monochromator. Intensity data were collected using a copper tube by step scanning through the angular range of interest. Diffraction spectra were obtained from the initial cobalt oxide and after reduction under flowing hydrogen at 350 C for times ranging from 2 to 16 h. Prior to removing the specimen from the environmental chamber of the X-ray camera, the specimen was passivated at room temperature for 24 h with a 0.2% oxygen-nitrogen gas mixture. The passivated samples were ground and a small portion was dispersed in distilled water ultrasonically. A drop of solution was placed on a carbon-coated Formvar electron micro- scope 75 mesh grid and allowed to dry. The prepared electron microscope specimens were observed on a Phillips EM-400 analytical electron microscope fitted with a field-emission gun and an energy dispersive analytical X-ray spectrometer. This instrument operated at 100 kv in the microdiffraction mode. Results and Discussion The X-ray spectra collected from the 9.5%Co-ZSM-5 and the ZSM-5 it- self are shown in Fig. 1. The complex diffraction pattern from the crystalline ZSM-5 obscures the details of the diffraction pattern from the cobalt metal in the 9.5%Co-ZSM-5 material. The cobalt spectrum was recovered from the Co-ZSM-5 spectrum by using the pure ZSM-5 spectrum and employing a Fourier unfolding technique described elsewhere [3].

The X-ray diffraction spectrum of the cobalt (110) obtained by Fourier unfolding of the spectra from 9.5%Co-ZSM-5 and pure ZSM-5. spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. This spectrum contains a sharp intense (002) peak from cobalt, a broad and less intense cobalt (101) and an overlapped cobalt (100), cobalt oxide (200). There exists a weak cobalt oxide (111) also. The same technique was employed to reveal the sharp cobalt (110) peak shown in Fig. 3. Faulting on the basal plane in the hexagonal close-packed structure produces broadening of all reflections, except those which have ( = 0, where h k = 3n 1, and n is an integer [4]. Reflections of the type h k = 3n are not broadened by the existence of stacking or growth faults [4-6]. From the spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 it is clear that there exist fault broadening in addition to particle size broadening of the (101) but the broadening of the (002) and (110) is much less and due only to small particles. The average particle size calculated from the (110) was 17 nm and from the (101) was 2.3 nm which correspond to a growth fault probability of 0.08 [4]. This would correspond to a fault on the average of every 12 basal planes or an average spacing between faults of 2.5 nm. This is the initial observation and quantitative measurement of growth faulting made on small particles of a hexagonal close-packed material. Usu- ally X-ray measurements of this type are made on large particle size (> 100 nm) material and in which the (OOf) and (hkO) profiles are not broadened except due to instrument effects. 306 The particle size distribution calculated from the shape of the (110) peak using a technique described previously [1] gave the results shown in Fig. 4. The biomodal distribution is typical of many obtained from this catalyst in the reduced condition. The distribution function shows two maxima, one at about 9 nm and another at about 24 nm. The average parti- cle size calculated from the distribution function is 17 nm which agrees with the average size obtained from the (110) diffraction peak shape analysis. The results obtained from observations made on the transmission elec- tron microscope (TEM) are in two categories. The distribution of cobalt on the support and the structure of the cobalt particles. The cobalt particles of various sizes were observed to be randomly distributed on the support as can be seen in Fig. 5. The cobalt distribution can be seen in the dark field image of the same area shown in Fig. 5(b). Measurements of the larger particles give sizes in the range of values of the first maximum in Fig. 4. In addition to large cobalt particles dispersed uniformly on the support, there exists very fine metallic cobalt in intimate mixture with the support material. A higher magnification of these smaller particles of cobalt can be seen in Fig. 6. A dark-field image (^ = [1101]) of a large cobalt particle (cobalt was confirmed by EDAX from this particle) of about 20 nm in size is shown in Fig. 7.

The average fault spacing of about 2.5 nm observed in the particle agrees with the average spacing measured by X-ray diffraction. This agreement ensures that the Fourier spectra unfolding technique provides reliable data and that basal plane faulting is the source of broadening of the (101) cobalt reflection. It is reasonable to expect that the surface atoms associated with the fault are primary candidates for active site positions. This is due to the electronic differences at the second nearest-neighbor positions or a step in 308 Fig. 7.

It is readily shown that the fault probabili- ty, a, also gives the average fraction of surface atoms lying on the fault or the fraction of surface atoms that are potential active sites. In the 9.5% co- balt on ZSM-5 support catalyst the active site density would be 0.08-times surface atom density of 3 X 1018 active sites (g cobalt)\"1 which is a very reasonable value. Conclusions Based on the results of this investigation it can be concluded that: 1. X-Ray diffraction methods give an accurate description of the struc- tural characteristics of cobalt particles in a catalyst. 2. Cobalt particles in the 9.5%Co-ZSM-5 contain a high concentration of basal plane faults. 3. Cobalt particles exist in a bimodal distribution of sizes when dis- persed on ZSM-5 support. 4. Intersection of the stacking fault with the particle surface may be the possible origin of active sites.
