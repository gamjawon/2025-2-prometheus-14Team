Amigues, Y. Chauvin, D. Commereuc* Institut Francais du Petrole, BP 311, 92506 Rueil-Malmaison (France) G. T. Hong, C. C. Lai and Y. H. Liu Chinese Petroleum Corporation, 239 Min-Sheng Road, Chia-yi 60036 (Taiwan) Abstract The metathesis reaction of ethylene-butene mixtures and the reverse metathesis of propylene have been studied in liquid phase under pressure at near-ambient temperature and in integral-type reactors. The rhenium on alumina catalyst used has been optimized to obtain the highest activity without the formation of oligomeric byproducts, which are shown to result from a cationic reaction. Deactivation of the catalyst is seen to have various origins. An intrinsic deactivation seems always operative, but a stronger deactivation occurs when impurities are present in the reacting olefins. Some of these impurities have a reversible effect, while others behave as permanent poisons. It is proposed that the stability of the catalyst with time is governed, at least in part, by the Lewis acidity of the active sites. Introduction The metathesis of propylene promoted by rhenium on alumina catalysts has been known since the pioneering works of researchers from British Petroleum [1] and from Phillips [2]. This reaction has been the subject of numerous kinetic studies, especially in vapor phase [3 7]. On the contrary, studies in the liquid phase are rare [8]. We are interested in the manufacture of propylene from mixtures of ethylene and butene, and have chosen to optimize the reaction in liquid phase under pressure, at near-ambient temperatures. The equilibrated reaction: C^H.4 + C4Hg > 2C3Hg has been studied in both directions, depending on the scale of the experiments. Our first goal was the optimization of the catalyst, making use of the kinetic constants of the reaction as a tool for estimating its performances. Our second point of interest is the problem of catalyst deactivation, which has seldom been treated in the literature, apart from [9, 10, 16]. First the results of our optimization work will be described, and in a second part, some observations about the deactivation of the catalyst shall be presented.

The support was a y-alumina with a surface area of 180 m2 g~1. After drying in an oven at 120 C, it was calcined at 550 C under air flow for several hours and then cooled either in air or under nitrogen. It was kept under nitrogen before use in the metathesis reaction. Metathesis reactions Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted on propylene with a stain- less-steel tubular reactor of 20 ml internal volume filled with 10 g of catalyst, which was operated in a semi-continuous mode. The propylene feedstock was injected (pressure: 3.8 MPa) continuously 8 h per day, the reactor being closed without any washings, under pressure, and maintained at the reaction temperature during the other 16 h. Experiments were generally conducted over at least 3 days, in order to insure an accurate determination of the rate of deactivation of the catalyst. Micropilot-scale experiments used a 50 ml tubular reactor filled with 30 g of catalyst, operating in a fully-continuous mode (24 h per day) with an ethylene-butene-2-feedstock, at 4 MPa pressure. Separate ethylene and butene-2 flows were regulated respectively with a gas-flow controller and a metering pump, and mixed at the input of the reactor. In these two types of experiments, the catalyst was regenerated using external furnaces. Pilot-plant-scale runs used a tubular reactor filled with 320 g of catalyst and equipped for in situ regeneration. Operation was fully- continuous on ethylene and butene (isomerized 64 cut) mixtures at 6 MPa pressure. In all of the above experiments, on-line analysis of the reactor effluent was carried out by gas chromatography using an alumina-PLOT column. After the completion of the bench and pilot experiments, a dem- onstration pilot plant using a 100 1 reactor was successfully operated in Taiwan. Determination of the kinetic parameters The experimental results have been interpreted on the basis of a Langmuir Htnshelwood model including a second-order equilibrated reaction. The rate constants derived from this model were used as a tool for the estimation of the activity of the catalysts. They were calculated according to the following relations: (i) For laboratory-scale experiments, perfectly-stirred reactor, reactant propylene: ^_Na,-N^ 2mfs with 41 f2- where A;(: rate constant at time t, m: mass of catalyst, N3^. molar flow rate of propylene in, N^: molar flow rate of propylene out, a;: conversion of propylene, Key equilibrium constant, .8=02/03+1)4/^3 (b,: adsorption coef- ficient of the olefin i).

Note that the above expressions are valid for operation in liquid phase only (or high-pressure gas phase), where the uncoordinated part of the active sites of the catalyst is generally assumed to be negligible. In cases where the used butene came from an isomerized 64 cut still containing a few % butene-1, the side metathesis reaction between butene- 1 and butene-2 giving extra propylene and pentene-2 has been taken into account. The amount of pentene-2 in the products was normally less than 3% by weight. Recent data can be found in the literature concerning determination of the equilibrium constant of the reaction .Keq, making use of the metathesis reaction itself [11]. They give somewhat different values from those calculated from the API tables [4]. We have also made some determinations, the results of which differ slightly from [11]. In our calculations, we have adopted the following correlation: K^= 2.833 XlCr4X^COC)+ 0.0833 between 20 and 80 C. Calculation of the rate constants needs the knowledge of the ratios of the adsorption coefficients b,A>3 relative to propylene for all components i of the reaction medium. Some data can be found in the literature for the adsorption of ethylene [12] and propylene [4] in the gas phase on alumina and on rhenium on alumina. No data has been found for operation in liquid phase. Thus the assumption has been made that the ratios of the adsorption coefficients are the same in the gas phase and in the liquid phase, and the set of coherent data from [4] has been used. 42 The deactivation of the catalyst was interpreted as if the amount of active catalyst were decreasing with time. This process has been shown to follow a first-order rate law, according to the relation: logekt=\\ogeko-kat in which ko: the initial metathesis rate constant, and kci'. the first order deactivation rate constant, are the two parameters used to characterize the performance of the catalysts. Results and discussion Optimization of the catalyst The support chosen is -/-alumina, because previous studies in our laboratory have shown that this best anchors firmly the rhenium surface species and avoids losses of rhenium during thermal activation [13]. Perrhenic acid and ammonium perrhenate were used as rhenium pre- cursors. Surprisingly, no noticeable differences were found in the properties of the catalysts made from these two precursors, although the acidities of the solutions used for the impregnation are quite different. The activity of the rhenium on alumina catalysts increases linearly with their rhenium content, as already demonstrated by others [14]. However, Fig. 1 also shows two other phenomena. The first is that the metathesis reaction does not work at very low rhenium contents (1% or less). This observation may be related to the appearance and increase in Bronsted acidity at the catalyst surface as the rhenium content is increased [15, 16]. This acidity arises at different levels of rhenium, depending on the intrinsic basicity of the alumina surface [15]. On the other hand, it has been proposed that there is a relationship between the Bronsted acidity of the catalyst and the C wt % Re Fig. 1. Propylene metathesis: effect of the content of rhenium (support -y-AlgOj) T=35 C, -P=3.8 MPa 43 metathesis activity [17]. The second point remarked is that beyond a given content of rhenium, the activity indeed continues to increase, but an oli- gomerization reaction of the olefins present superimposes on the metathesis reaction. This is ascertained by the progressive appearance of viscous liquid byproducts (a complex mixture > 5 by gas chromatography), as the rhenium content increases beyond the composition referred to as C in Fig. 1. For example, Table 1 shows that a catalyst containing 12.7% Re produced 1% liquid oligomers along with the expected metathesis products. This phe- nomenon was also accompanied by a faster rate of catalyst deactivation (see below). We suspected that this oligomerization side-reaction could have a cationic origin. We thus prepared some modified catalysts in which washing of the alumina with hydrochloric acid [17, 18], preimpregnation with (NH4)2HP04 or with NH4F [19] were carried out, treatments known to increase the acidity of the carrier and also claimed to increase the activity of the resulting metathesis catalyst. We also reached this conclusion, but Table 1 shows that all of these more acidic catalysts invariably led to the formation of liquid oligomers, even for the catalysts with moderate rhenium contents. The optimized composition (C) is that which leads to the highest activity in the metathesis reaction, without the formation of oligomeric byproducts. When this optimized composition was rendered more acidic by the introduction of a small amount of sulfate anions in a non-aqueous medium, the quantity of oligomers formed was increased by four orders of magnitude, again supporting our assumption. Table 2 summarizes some comparative kinetic results obtained with the optimized catalyst composition in experiments at different scales, using from 10 g to 15 kg of catalyst. The consistency of the results is proof a posteriori of the validity of the Langmuir Hinshelwood (LH) model (see Experimental). Accurate kinetic determinations with a differential reactor seems to favour a different model based on the carbene mechanism [3, 5]. Integral reactors, such as those we have used, are not good tools to distinguish between close kinetic models. However, although it is not the purpose of the present paper TABLE 1 The cationic origin of the oligomerization side-reaction Catalyst\" Oligomers1' optimized composition 1.6 ppm 12.7% Re 1% 11% Re on alumina washed with 1 N HC1 a few % 5.8% Re on alumina impregnated with (NH4)aHP04 (P/Re=1.72) a few % 8% Re on alumina impregnated with NI^F (F/Re=1.07) 20% optimized composition treated with MegSC^ in pentane solution (S/Re=0.11) 1.2% Propylene metathesis, T=36 C, P=3.8 MPa. \"Support y-Al^Os. \"\"Amount based on the feed propylene. 44 TABLE 2 Comparative kinetic results Expt Reaction' Mass of catalyst fco\" V (g) (mol h-1 g-') (h-1) lab (1) 10 0.052 0.0095 micropilot (2) 30 0.046 0.013 pilot (2) 320 0.064 0.0083 pilot (2) 15000 0.062 0.0038 r=35 C, P= 3.8-6 MPa.

The effect of temperature between 20 and 70 C has been studied both on the rate of the metathesis reaction and on the catalyst deactivation. The activation energy of the metathesis reaction was found to lie in the range 10.0-11.7 kcalmol\"1. The activation energy of the deactivation of the catalyst fell in the range 6.7-8.9 kcal mol~1. Thus, increasing the temperature accelerates both the metathesis reaction rate and deactivation of the catalyst. Some observations concerning catalyst deactivation The supported rhenium catalysts deactivate during the metathesis reaction. Mol et al. [10, 16] have suggested several reasons which could explain this deactivation with processing time: termination reactions affecting the metal carbene active sites, adsorption of polymeric byproducts, poisoning by polar compounds. However, no clear evidence for these different causes of deactivation have been presented. In the following, experiments are described which exemplify different types of deactivation and which show that some may be reversible, while others are permanent. Even when the greatest care is taken, either during the catalyst preparation, where the effect of impurities has been studied by Hsu [20], or during the metathesis reaction as concerns the purity of the olefin feedstocks, deactivation of the rhenium catalysts cannot be avoided. In Fig. 2, we present evidence that, using carefully purified olefins, deactivation of the catalyst occurs to the same extent either when in use in a continuous operation or during static contact with the olefins. Two experiments of propylene metathesis were conducted sequentially with the same catalyst sample fed into two parallel reactors. The first was put on stream during periods 0-8 h, 23-28 h and 48-53 h (CO) in the figure), the second one during periods 0-5 h, 93-102 h and 118-125 h (( ) in the figure). During the remaining time, the reactors were isolated at the reaction temperature, the catalyst then remaining in contact with the olefin reaction 45 20 40 60 80 100 120 Time (h) Fig. 2.

Results showed that the instantaneous activities in the two deactivation experiments fell on the same straight line. On the other hand, experiments conducted at different LHSV, other things being equal, showed that the deactivation rate constant k^ remained unchanged between LHSV=2.4 (A;d=0.011 h-1) and LHSV=7.2 (7^=0.013 h~'). In these experiments, the possibility of deactivation by traces of impurities remaining in the propylene is thus ruled out. Extraction of the catalyst by boiling heptane at the end of the runs showed practically no oligomer formation (in the few ppm range), which could have blocked the active sites. The conclusion is that what could be called an intrinsic deactivation process must exist, which is related only to the functioning of the active rhenium species. Cationically reactive olefins such as isobutene or 1,3-butadiene, when added to the propylene fed in the metathesis reaction, led to faster deactivation of the catalyst, along with the formation of liquid oligomers, as shown in Table 3. However, at least in the case of butadiene, this increase of the deactivation rate is reversible. Figure 3 illustrates two metathesis experiments conducted with the same catalyst sample. The first used pure propylene feedstock and is taken as a reference ((0) in the figure). It was stopped after 52 h total contact time with olefins. The second experiment (( ) in the figure) used propylene to which was added 0.3% 1,3-butadiene up to the time 32 h. During this first period, a lower initial activity and a more rapid deactivation are noted. Then, after 32 h, the catalyst was washed with pure propylene in situ in the reactor for 3 h, and was left inside the reactor without purging until 95 h, when the metathesis reaction was resumed for 46 TABLE 3 Deactivation with formation of oligomers Olefin m the V V Oligomers0 propylene feed (mol h-1 g-1) (h-1) none 0.052 0.0095 1.6 ppm isobutene\"* 0.023 0.024 0.8% 1,3-butadiene' 0.023 0.024 0.02% Propylene metathesis, T=35 C, P=3.8 MPa. \"Initial metathesis rate constant.

These observations indicate that the faster deactivation induced by the presence of butadiene is to be attributed to the formation of oligomers which behave as diffusions! barriers and block the active sites. However, as soon 47 as the oligomers are removed by washing the catalyst, normal activity is recovered, consistent with intrinsic deactivation alone. The influence of several polar, basic compounds which could be present in industrial butene fractions was studied first by mixing them with propylene (laboratory experiments, see Experimental). The results are reported in Table 4. Water, methanol, dimethyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) and di- methylformamide (DMF) mainly influenced the deactivation rate of the catalyst rather than its initial activity. The effect of the dimethyl ether is particularly strong. When present at the level of 0.36% by weight, it induced deactivation of the catalyst three hundred times more rapid. In another type of experiment, basic compounds (referred to as B in the following) were introduced as a short pulse in the butene-2 flow of the micropilot-scale apparatus (see Experimental). The total amount of B which was injected is given in Table 5 as the molar ratio of B to the rhenium used in the experiment. Two situations occurred, illustrated in Fig. 4. In the first one, found on injection of dimethyl ether, DMF, 2,6-di-t-butylpyridine (t-BugPy) and ethylene oxide, nothing apparently happened at the moment of injection and afterward (Fig. 4a, Table 5). Compared with the results of continuous injection of B (vide supra), where faster deactivation is observed, it must be concluded that the effect of the above compounds is reversible. We have verified that this is indeed true in the case of dimethyl ether.

The second situation was encountered in the case of the injection of water, methanol and MTBE, and corresponded to an increase in the deactivation rate at the moment of the injection, which was sustained even after complete elution of B (Fig. 4b, Table 5). Pyridine (Py) exhibited a peculiar behaviour, as its effect appeared only 15 h after the moment of the injection. At the present time, we have no explanation for this observation. Two different amounts of methanol were injected, corresponding to 0.92 and 7.36 mol% relative to the rhenium. The effect was roughly the same. At first sight, it is surprising that the two ethers, dimethyl ether and MTBE, behave differently. However, on the acidic surface of the catalyst MTBE may undergo decomposition to methanol and isobutene; thus the effect of MTBE is like that of methanol and not like that of an ether. 49 S S -1 -2 - Time (h) Fig. 5. Propylene metathesis: activity (log ^m) vs. time. The reversible effect of dimethyl ether: pulse injection of 700 ppm dimethyl ether at time zero. T=35 C, P=3.8 MPa. Considering that the basic compounds B which were studied exhibit their effect even when introduced in amounts corresponding to less than 1% of the total rhenium, and that higher amounts do not produce a stronger effect, it implies that B coordinate to the active centers, the amount of which is then also less than 1% of the total rhenium. This conclusion is in agreement with the figures obtained from other methods [4, 21, 22]. On the other hand, if B coordinates to the active centers at these low levels, it is probably because these centers are more acidic than any other surface sites. The literature data seem to indicate that the activity of the rhenium metathesis catalysts is related to their Bronsted acidity, and not to their Lewis acidity [17], although Hsu has claimed that both influence the activity [23]. From the pulse injection experiments, the B compounds may be ranked into two classes: those which exhibit an irreversible effect on the rate of deactivation and which are protic compounds (or compounds able to liberate a protic one, as MTBE), and those which exhibit a reversible effect, which are non-protic Lewis bases. These observations may be accounted for if we assume that any basic compound B lowers the Lewis acidity of the active rhenium centers: permanently if B is a protic compound, the Lewis acidity being partly destroyed by protonation; temporarily if B is a Lewis base, the Lewis acidity being partly neutralized through a reversible coordination equilibrium. 50 Considering the effect of B on the deactivation rate of the catalyst, we propose that the stability with time of these rhenium catalysts is governed, at least in part, by the Lewis acidity of the active rhenium centers. This conclusion may be related to the favourable role of the Lewis acidity of the ligands in the stabilization of carbene or metallocyclic complexes in the metathesis coordination chemistry [24, 25].

Commereuc ∗ Institut Français du Pétrole, BP 311, 92506 Rueil-MalmaisonFrance * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. C.T. Hong C.C. Lai Y.H. Liu Chinese Petroleum Corporation, 239 Min-Sheng Road, Chia-yi 60036 Taiwan The metathesis reaction of ethylene-butene mixtures and the reverse metathesis of propylene have been studied in liquid phase under pressure at near-ambient temperature and in integral-type reactors. The rhenium on alumina catalyst used has been optimized to obtain the highest activity without the formation of oligomeric byproducts, which are shown to result from a cationic reaction. Deactivation of the catalyst is seen to have various origins. An intrinsic deactivation seems always operative, but a stronger deactivation occurs when impurities are present in the reacting olefins. Some of these impurities have a reversible effect, while others behave as permanent poisons. It is proposed that the stability of the catalyst with time is governed, at least in part, by the Lewis acidity of the active sites.
