Division of Chemical Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University 1-3 Machikaneyama Toyonaka Osaka 560-8531 Japan The selective conversion of ethylene into propylene (ETP) has garnered significant attention due to the growing demand for the product of this reaction in the petrochemical industry. In this study, we developed a series of Ni-loaded dealuminated Beta zeolite catalysts for the ETP reaction. The catalyst loaded with 0.07 wt% Ni showed stable and high catalytic activity with 28% propylene yield and 16% butylene yield, despite very low Ni content compared to previously reported catalysts. Temperature-programmed H2 reduction and NH3-desorption analyses showed that the active sites were Ni species grafted onto the defective silanols of dealuminated zeolites.

These compounds are used as raw materials to manufacture various products, such as plastics, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubbers. Light olefins are currently produced by naphtha cracking, which relies heavily on the depleting petroleum resources, and has limited control over the production ratio, which may not meet the future demand [1,2]. Therefore, the development of low-cost processes for producing light olefins using nonpetroleum-derived resources is highly desirable [3]. The discovery of shale gas reserves has facilitated the manufacture of light olefins [4]. For example, ethane crackers selectively produce ethylene over other olefins. However, the demand for propylene has increased in the past few years, and the gap between increasing propylene demand and supply needs to be filled [5,6]. Furthermore, the production of C4 olefins along with propylene is desirable. Various methods for propylene production, such as dehydrogenation of propane [7–9] olefin cracking [10–13], olefin metathesis [14–17], and the conversion of methanol to propylene [18–20], have been reported. Recently, direct ethylene-to-propylene (ETP) conversion has attracted attention as a novel method for propylene production. The ethylene/propylene ratio can be adjusted as required in the ETP reaction. An integrated ethane-to-ethylene conversion and subsequent ethylene-to-propylene conversion using ethane crackers could be a viable production route for propylene. The ETP reaction was first reported for Mo- [21] and W-supported [22] olefin metathesis catalysts. Ni-exchanged MCM-41 [23–26] and MCM-48 [27] have also been reported as highly active ETP catalysts. In the proposed reaction pathway, ethylene dimerizes to 1- butylene on the Ni active sites and isomerizes to 2- butylene on the acidic active sites of MCM-41; then, 2- butylene and the unreacted ethylene undergoes metathesis on the Ni active sites to form propylene [23]. Propylene was produced by conjunct polymerization in another study [28]. Moreover, zeolites like SAPO-34 [29,30], ZSM-5 [31–34], and SSZ-13 [35,36] have been used as catalysts in the ETP reaction. However, Ni-loaded catalysts tend to have lower activity due to pore blockage caused by NiO particles [37]. Zeolite catalysts encounter deactivation problems due to limited diffusion by coke deposition [38]. In this study, we chose Beta zeolites with relatively large micropores (12-membered ring structures) as ETP catalysts to improve diffusion. As the Al species in the zeolite framework are acidic and cause the formation of by-products, the zeolite was dealuminated. Ni species were introduced into the space where the Al atoms were removed via the incipient wetness method to support Ni with a high dispersion. Subsequently, we characterized the catalysts via X-ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray fluorescence (XRF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible spectroscopy, N2-adsorption isotherms, and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements. Finally, the catalytic performance of the prepared Beta zeolites was evaluated in the ETP reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation For the dealumination of the zeolite, a H+-type Beta zeolite (Tosoh HSZ-931 HOA, SiO2/Al2O3 = 28.9) was stirred with 35% HNO3 (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Co.) at 393 K for 24 h. The resulting powder was washed by mixing it with deionized water and isolated via centrifugation. This process was repeated three times. The product was dried at 363 K and calcined at 823 K for 5 h. The obtained sample is denoted as deAl-beta. For comparison, deAl-Beta(L) was obtained by slightly dealuminating beta using the following procedure: H+ -type Beta zeolite was stirred at low temperature of 333 K for 24 h with 2.33% HNO3. The resulting powder was washed, dried, and calcined using the same procedure as that used for deAl-Beta. In addition, silicalite-1 was synthesized as a comparison of all-silica zeolite support referring to our previous work [39]. The dealuminated sample deAl-Beta was then impregnated with aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Co.) at a 100:x (x = 0.1, 0.5, and 1) mass ratio of deAl-Beta to nickel nitrate hexahydrate using a previously reported method [40]. The mixture was dried and calcined under the same conditions as those used for dealumination. The obtained sample was denoted as Ni(x)/deAl-beta. For comparison, Ni was loaded onto Beta, deAl-Beta(L) and silicalite-1 using the same procedure to obtain Ni(0.1)/Beta and Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta(L), respectively. In addition, NiO-loaded deAl-Beta (NiO(0.1)/deAl-Beta) was prepared by a similar impregnation method using NiO (Aldrich), deAl-Beta and deionized water. 2.2 Characterization The crystal structures of the catalysts were determined by XRD on a Philips X’Pert-MPD diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (wavelength, 0.15418 nm), operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. The scan range was from 5o to 90o (2θ) at 0.10o s–1. The chemical compositions were determined by XRF measurements. TEM images were obtained using a Hitachi H-800 at 200 kV. The N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a BELSORP MINI X instrument (MicrotracBEL). Prior to the experiment, the samples were degassed at 523 K to a constant pressure of 10 Pa. The nature of the formed Ni species was characterized by UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 800 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-570). H2-TPR measurements were performed on a BELCAT II instrument equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MicrotracBEL). The catalyst was pretreated under Ar flow at 773 K for 1 h and then cooled to an adsorption temperature of 373 K. H2 (100 cm3/min) and Ar (1 cm3/min) were introduced into the sample cell and heated to 1183 K at a rate of 10 K min-1. The acidic properties and states of the Ni species in the prepared catalysts were evaluated by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements using a BELCAT II instrument equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MicrotracBEL). The catalyst was pretreated under a He flow at 773 K for 1 h and then cooled to the adsorption temperature of 373 K. A mixture of NH3 and He gas (NH3 1 vol%) was introduced into the sample cell for 1 h. Subsequently, He (30 cm3/min) was passed through the sample to remove weakly adsorbed NH3 for 1 h. The sample was then heated to 973 K at a rate of 10 K min−1. 2.3 ETP reactions ETP reactions were performed in a fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.05 g) was loaded into a quartz tube (inner diameter = 4 mm), and the temperature was increased to 723 K under a He flow. Feed gas was of 11.3 vol% ethylene and balanced He was fed at a total flow rate of 5.65 cm3/min. The contact time was W/F = 29.2 g h/mol (where F is the total flow rate (cm3/min) and W is the catalyst weight (g)). The product stream was analyzed online with Shimadzu GC-2025 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector. GS ALUMINA was used as the gas chromatography (GC) column. Ethylene conversion [%] and product yields [%] were calculated as follows: Ethylene conversion % = 100 × C − mol of Ethylene at the inlet − ( C − mol of Ethylene at the outlet ) ( C − mol of Ethylene at the inlet ) Product yields % = 100 × ( C − mol of product at the outlet ) ( C − mol of Ethylene at the inlet ) The carbon balances were approximately 100% for almost all ETP reaction tests. The amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The weight losses from 573 to 1073 K were assigned to the combustion of the deposited coke. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the dealuminated and Ni-loaded Beta catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the *BEA-type structure of Beta is maintained in the dealuminated samples without any structural collapse. As shown in Fig. 1(b), there were no specific peaks associated with Ni species in the XRD patterns of the Ni-doped samples. This result suggests that the Ni content of the catalysts was low and no bulk Ni species were formed. Fig. S1 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/deAl-Beta with different amounts of Ni and NiO. No specific peaks related to Ni species were observed in any of the samples, which could be ascribed to low Ni and NiO content in the catalysts. The Si/Al ratio and the amount of Ni doped into the Beta zeolites were analyzed using EDX measurements. The results are presented in Table 1. The Si/Al ratio in Beta was increased by the dealumination process. The Si/Al ratio of deAl-Beta(L) was intermediate between those of Beta and deAl-Beta. Table S1 presents the EDX spectra of Ni/deAl-Beta with various amounts of Ni and NiO. The amount of doped Ni was comparable in all the samples. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the catalysts. The dealuminated and Ni-doped samples retained the particle structure of Beta. Fig. S2 shows TEM images of Ni/deAl-Beta with different amounts of Ni and NiO. All samples retained the particle structure of Beta, and no Ni aggregates were found due to the small amount of Ni and NiO introduced into the catalyst. Fig. S3 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms of the catalysts. The dealuminated catalyst deAl-Beta showed a reduced micropore volume and increased mesopore volume owing to dealumination. However, Ni loading had no significant effect on the pore volume. Fig. 3 shows the UV–vis spectra of the catalysts. The Ni-doped sample did not exhibit a broad peak at 300–340 nm corresponding to NiO [41]. This result suggests that the small amount of Ni introduced into the zeolite was not in the form of NiO. Fig. S4 shows the UV–vis spectra of Ni/deAl-Beta with different amounts of Ni and NiO. A broad peak at 300–340 nm was observed for all three samples, indicating that the excess Ni was in the form of NiO. To obtain further information on the Ni species in Ni/deAl-Beta, H2-TPR measurements were performed. The amount of Ni was too low for detection. Fig. S5 shows the H2-TPR profiles of NiO(0.1)/deAl-Beta and Ni(1)/deAl-Beta catalysts. A reduction peak at ∼673 K was observed for NiO(0.1)/deAl-Beta, which could be attributed to bulk NiO [42]. Similarly, a reduction peak appears at ∼673 K for Ni(1)/deAl-Beta, indicating the presence of excess Ni. Moreover, another reduction peak at ∼973 K was observed for Ni(1)/deAl-Beta, which could be attributed to Ni species grafted onto the dealuminated zeolites. Fig. 4 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of the catalysts. Pristine Beta showed two peaks owing to the acidity of the zeolite, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD profile of pristine H+-type aluminosilicate zeolite [43]. As expected, no zeolitic acid peaks were observed for the dealuminated zeolite deAl-Beta. Furthermore, the peak intensities for Beta and deAl-Beta(L) decreased after Ni loading. This is ascribed to the exchange of the acidic protons in Beta with the less acidic Ni ions. Moreover, Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta showed a peak only at ∼993 K, and no peak was observed in the temperature range of 373–873 K, which is characteristic of zeolite acidic sites. Ni species grafted onto silica materials exhibit a peak at higher temperatures in NH3-TPD [44]. The high-temperature reduction peak in Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta may be due to the adsorption of NH3 on the Ni species grafted onto the dealuminated zeolites. Fig. 5 shows the changes in ethylene conversion and product yield over time for each ETP catalyst. The catalytic activity decreased with dealumination, as shown in Fig. 5(a, c, e). In particular, deAl-Beta showed low activity because most of the Al species responsible for the acidity of zeolites were removed, as acid sites are the active sites for this reaction [45]. Nevertheless, rapid deactivation was observed for Beta even though it showed a high initial activity. The weight loss of the spent catalyst was measured to determine the amount of coke formed during the reaction. Fig. S6 shows the thermogravimetric analysis curves of Beta and Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta after the reaction. Beta showed a higher amount of coke deposition than Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta. This deactivation could be attributed to pore blockage by the coke formed by the undesired side or excess reactions of the acidic sites of Beta. Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta has almost no acidic sites, resulting in decreased coke deposition. Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta produced higher yields of propylene and butylene (27% and 16%, respectively) and was stable up to 180 min (Fig. 5(d)). The results of the reproducibility test of the ETP reaction with Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta are shown in Fig. S7. The results of the second test showed the same high propylene and butylene yields (20% and 16%, respectively) as in the first test. Similar results were not observed for Ni(0.1)/Beta and Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta (L), as shown in Fig. 5(b, f). This result suggests that the Ni species grafted in the dealuminated zeolites were introduced into the space from which Al atoms were more active sites than the zeolitic acid sites and the Ni ions present at the ion-exchange sites of zeolites. The propylene and butylene yields of Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta (L), which are slightly higher than those of deAl-Beta(L), also indicate that the Ni species grafted in the dealuminated zeolites are the superior active sites. Next, we investigated the catalytic performances of different Ni/deAl-Beta catalysts containing different amounts of doped Ni (Fig. S8). As the amount of Ni increased, ethylene conversion as well as propylene and C4 olefin yields decreased. Ni aggregates were observed with increasing Ni loading, suggesting that Ni aggregates were not suitable for the reaction (Fig. S9). In addition, the catalytic activity of NiO(0.1)/deAl-Beta is lower than that of Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta (Fig. S8 (c)). The lower catalytic activity of NiO(0.1)/deAl-Beta could be ascribed to the presence of Ni in the form of NiO, which is not an active site for the ETP reaction. Ni(0.1)/silicalite-1 exhibited a negligible activity (Fig. S8 (d)). Although silicalite-1 has smaller micropores than Beta zeolites, the pore size of silicalite-1 is large enough for ethylene to diffuse out through the micropores of silicalite-1. Actually, ZSM-5, whose crystal and pore structure are the same as those of silicalite-1, has been applied to the ETP reaction [31,32,45]. According to these reports, the porosity is not the main reason for the difference in activity between Ni(0.1)/silicalite-1 and Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta. The main reason for this could be that there were fewer defects in silicalite-1 than in deAl-Beta. In the case of Ni(0.1)/silicalite-1, the Ni species must have been in the form of NiO rather than Ni species grafted in the dealuminated zeolites, which are the active sites for the ETP reaction, leading to low catalytic activity. In addition, these results support the idea that defective silanols play an important role in the formation of Ni species grafted onto dealuminated zeolites. Table 2 presents the results of the ETP reaction tests with typical catalysts. Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta showed a higher catalytic performance with a very low Ni loading of 0.07 wt% compared to other Ni loaded catalysts. Furthermore, the ethylene and propylene selectivities were comparable to or even higher than those of the previously reported catalysts. Comparing ZSM-5 and Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta, ethylene conversion was inferior to that of ZSM-5, but propylene and C4 olefins were obtained more selectively. This is probably because dealumination suppressed the side reactions caused by the acid sites of the zeolite. Fig. S10 shows the ETP reactions with different W/F values. In the case of the catalyst Beta, the amount of alkanes increased with increasing contact time, which could be attributed to the zeolitic acid sites. However, in the case of deAl-Beta, the C4 olefin yield decreased and the propylene yield increased with increasing contact time. Therefore, the pathway for the ETP reaction with Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta was estimated as follows (Scheme S1). The reaction begins with the formation of 1- butylene via the dimerization of ethylene at the active sites of the Ni species grafted onto the dealuminated zeolites. It has been reported that a four-coordinated Ni species on the Ni/Beta catalyst promotes the dimerization of ethylene [46]. Subsequently, 1- butylene was isomerized to 2- butylene in the silanol group. It has been reported that the silanol group can be the active site of 1- butylene [16]. Finally, the metathesis of ethylene and 2- butylene at the active sites of the Ni species grafted in the dealuminated zeolites is thought to form propylene. 4 Conclusions We developed a series of Beta zeolite catalysts for the selective conversion of ethylene to propylene. Beta zeolites were dealuminated via acid treatment and impregnated with different amounts of Ni to afford Ni(x)/deAl-Beta catalysts (where x = 0.1, 0.5, and 1 wt%). Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta loaded with 0.07 wt% Ni showed high catalytic activity in the conversion of ethylene to propylene and butylene with ethylene conversion of 51%, propylene yield of 27%, and butylene yield of 16%. Despite the lower Ni loading compared to previously reported Ni-loaded catalysts, this catalyst showed activity comparable to or better than that of these catalysts. Our experimental results indicate that the active sites are Ni species grafted onto the silanols in dealuminated zeolites. Furthermore, this catalyst contained almost no zeolitic acid, thus suppressing side reactions and reducing the amount of coke deposition.

In this study, we developed a series of Ni-loaded dealuminated Beta zeolite catalysts for the ETP reaction. The catalyst loaded with 0.07 wt% Ni showed stable and high catalytic activity with 28% propylene yield and 16% butylene yield, despite very low Ni content compared to previously reported catalysts. Temperature-programmed H2 reduction and NH3-desorption analyses showed that the active sites were Ni species grafted onto the defective silanols of dealuminated zeolites.",
