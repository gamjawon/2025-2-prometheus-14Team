Graphical abstract In monitoring the photo-catalytic reaction of salicylic acid over RIT, two catalytic degradation reactions are observed: one is the de-carboxylation; and the other is the hydro-deoxygenation. The photo-induced e–h pair from the crystalline titania domain in RIT plays the key role in the de-carboxylation degradation. The Ru0/ Ru4+ ratio of Ru2O in RIT is the pivitol factor in the direct cleavage of Caro O bond via hydro-deoxygenation. Ruthenium oxide incorporated titania (RIT) photocatalyst, with verified ruthenium oxide ratio, have been prepared for photo-degradation. In monitoring the photo-catalytic reaction of salicylic acid over RIT, two degradation steps are observed. The first one is the de-carboxylation. The other step is the hydro-deoxygenation. The final product collected from the degradation is benzene. On the basis of experimental results, the photo-induced e–h pair from the crystalline domain of titania in RIT plays the key role in inducing the de-carboxylation degradation. As for the hydro-deoxygenation reaction, the Ru0/ Ru4+ ratio of incorporated ruthenium oxide in RIT is the pivitol factor in the direct cleavage of Caro O bond of phenol. The best selectivity for Caro O bond cleavage (71.9%) is shown in the RIT-1, Ru/Ti = 3.53%, route. If the ratio of Ru/Ti reaches to 10.81% (RIT-3), the selectivity decreases to 4.8%. Keywords Photocatalyst Titania Ruthenium oxide Hydro-deoxygenation 1 Introduction In the study of hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) process, two typical reactions are often mentioned in literature. One is the direct deoxygenation (DDO) [1–5]. In this reaction, the most known example is the catalysis of phenol to benzene [2,3]. One single hydrogen equivalent will be utilized in the reduction reaction [4]. The other route employs special hydrogenation (HYD) catalysts for the reductive catalysis of phenol to cyclohexanone [3,4]. The following reactions include: reduction, dehydration, and deoxygenation [3,4]. During these steps, four hydrogen equivalents will be consumed. The final product collected from the reaction is cyclohexane [3,4]. In this process, more expensive hydrogen equivalents are required for the hydrogenation of double bonds in the starting materials. Since the cost down and the efficient energy consume is required by the custom-designed reaction in industrial green chemistry, [6] the direct cleavage of oxygen from Caro O bond will be preferred. In addition, in comparison of thermal catalysis and photo-catalysis, the photocatalytic reaction is considered to be economic advantage to operate under milder condition. Moreover, the operating condition can be optimized to obtain a much better selectivity via the photocatalytic route [7]. Here, a newly prepared bi-functional photocatalyst, ruthenium oxide incorporated titania nanoparticles (RIT) is employed to perform the desired HDO catalysis reaction with the direct cleavage of oxygen from Caro O bond. In the photo-catalysis of salicylic acid (SA) over RIT, two catalytic steps are observed. The first one is the generally observed de-carboxylation. The −COOH functional group of SA releases a proton to induce the leaving of CO2 group [8,9]. The obtained product is phenol. In the following step, the ruthenium atom of RIT acts as a Lewis base to adopt a proton from aqueous solvent [4]. Meanwhile, the oxophilic Ti4+ ion of titania attacks the oxygen of −OH group bonded with aromatic ring to form the Ti-−OH bonding [10,11]. The HDO with the direct cleavage of oxygen from Caro O bond, is then initialized. The final product obtained from the photo-degradation is benzene. In our previous work, the salicylic acid is barely initialized the HDO over metal oxide incorporated TiO2 nanocomposite [9,12]. It is believed that the oxidation state of incorporated co-catalyst plays a vital role in the HDO reaction.[12,14] In this paper, the newly prepared RuO2/TiO2 photocatalyst is employed to investigate the mechanism of HDO. The variation of ruthenium oxidation state is expected to be responsible for the direct cleavage of Caro O bond via hydro-deoxygenation.[12,14] Meanwhile, the traditional HDO is a hydrogenolysis process with the help of high equivalent hydrogen to produce biofuel [10,15]. The required catalyst is sulfided NiMo/γ-Al2O or CoMo/γ-Al2O3 [10]. In this study, the hydro-deoxygenation process doesn’t need the addition of hydrogen into the reaction. Moreover, the sulfide is not required in RIT photo-catalytic reaction. The bifunctional catalyst RIT can provide a low cost and environmental friendly photo-catalytic degradation route via the direct cleavage of Caro O bond. 2 Experimental (a)Chemicals. Ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate, RuCl3. xH2O, (RCH), and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TPAB) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBO) was obtained from Fluka. Salicylic acid (SA, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were used as supplied. Ethylene glycol (EG, reagent grade, 99%, Showa) was used without any purification. (b)Synthesis of RIT. The photo-catalyst RIT was prepared by the reaction of RCH, template TPAB, and TBO in EG solvent. A presentative preparation method is given in the followings. In a bottle with tri-neck, template TPAB (2.0 g) was mixed with EG (30 mL) by 30 min stirring. The reagents RCH (0.061 g) and TBO (2.0 mL), mole ratio = 0.025: 1, were added into TPAB/EG solvent, respectively. The refluxing temperature was set at 177 ± 5 0C with a 250 rpm stirring speed [8,9]. At the beginning of reaction, the color of solution was black-gray. After 20 min refluxing, the solution changed to colorless. The clear colorless solution maintained for ˜25 min. Then, the color turned to dark black. The second change of color indicated the nucleation between TBO and RCH monomers was initialized [8,9]. After the reaction, the dark-black precipitate was washed by the mixture of 10 mL of ethanol, and 10 mL of DI water. The final product was dried in hood for future characterization. 3 Results 3.1 Characterization of RIT There various atomic ratio of Ru/Ti samples, RIT-1 (Ru/Ti = 2.5%), RIT-2, (Ru/Ti = 5%), and RIT-3 (Ru/Ti = 10%) were prepared by the experimental purposes. The growth rate of composite RIT nanocrystallites is controlled by the competition between titania and ruthenium oxide crystalline seeds [12,13]. By comparison, the difference in partial charge between Ti atom (+0.63) in TBO and Ru atom (+0.59) in RTC is negligible [9,13]. The nucleophilic attack from EG to TBO or RTC is occurred simultaneously [9,13]. Nevertheless, the concentration of TBO is dominate. The evolution of titania cluster is quicker than that of ruthenium oxide cluster. 3.1.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The crystallinity and detailed composition of the RIT product collected at the 48th h were studied by TEM. A representative image of RIT-1 is given in Fig. 1 (a), denoted as RIT-1-48 h. The sample is calcinated at 550 0C for 3 h to eliminate EG. The average size of individual nanoparticles, observed in this image, is smaller than 10 nm. The d-spacing between the lattice fringes, (3.57 Å), marked by red circles, matches the (101) crystal phases of anatase TiO2 [9,13–15], as shown in Fig. 1(b). In the same figure, the d-spacing of lattice fringes (3.19 Å), marked by tangerline circles, matches the RuO2 (110) phases. These two crystalline phases are the major phases in the TEM micrograph. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of TEM, Fig. 1(c), shows Ti Kα peak, (4.51 keV), and Kβ peak (4.93 keV). In addition, two Ru peak, Lα (2.558 keV), and Lβ (2.683 keV) are mixed as a board peak, ranging from, 2.5 keV to 2.9 keV [16]. Another tiny Ru peak (Kα) is shown at 19.24 keV. The EDX data confirm the existence of Ti and Ru crystalline domains in RIT-1. In the TEM image of RIT-3-48 h, given in Fig. 2 (a), the morphology of RIT-3-48 h is similar to that of RIT-1-48 h, i.e. an agglomerated secondary particle. In Fig. 2(b), the crystalline phase (101) and (200) (d-spacing 1.89 Å) of TiO2, marked by red circles, are clearly shown in the image. As for the ruthenium oxide, the (110) phase, marked by tangerine circles, is observed. In the EDX spectrum, Fig. 2(c), both the Ti peaks and Ru peaks are clearly identified. The gross atomic ratio of Ru/Ti, collected from EDX data, is ˜2.83% for RIT-1 and is ˜10.21% for RIT-3, respectively. A similar method is used to characterize RIT-2 sample. The gross ratio of Ru/Ti for RIT-2 is ˜ 5.13%. 3.1.2 Powder X-ray diffraction spectra (P-XRD) The P-XRD is used to monitor the variation in Ru/Ti ratio of RIT-48 h samples. The diffraction patterns are given in Fig. 3 (3) for RIT-1-48 h, and Fig. 3(b) for RIT-3-48 h, respectively. In the region of 100-800 (two theta), nine peaks are recorded, which match the anatase structure of TiO2 [17a]. In addition, in Fig. 3(a), one peak matches (110) phase of RuO2, denoted as R(110). In Fig. 3(b), two peaks match (110) and (101) phases of RuO2, denoted as R(110) and R(101) [17b]. The RIT-2-48 h spectrum is very similar to that of RIT-3-48 h. The P-XRD data is consistent with the results observed in TEM images. 3.1.3 X-ray photo-emission spectra (XPS) The microanalysis for Ru/Ti ratio in RIT samples are quantitatively measured by XPS spectra. The small region XPS scan of RIT samples is shown in Fig. 4 (a), from 470 eV to 450 eV, to evaluate the λmax shift of Ti 2p1/2 (463 eV), and Ti 2p3/2 (458.8 eV) [16]. The sample charging has been corrected. The variation of λmax shift in binding energy (BE) for Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 in the three samples is negligible. The region-wise XPS scan for ruthenium oxide, from 278 KeV to 289 K eV, is provided in Fig. 4(b). Two broad bands are shown in the region of interest. One band is from 289 eV to 282 eV, and the other band is from 282 eV to 278 eV. Theoretically, four Ru peaks, Ru4+ 3p 3/2 (285 eV), Ru4+ 3d 5/2 (283 eV), Ru0 3d 5/2 (280 eV), Ru0 3d3/2 (284 eV) and one C 1s peak are located in the region [16]. The exact location of λmax for the four Ru peaks are unclear. The application of peak deconvolution to precisely determine the λmax location of the four peaks is an accessible method. The elemental microanalysis data obtained from XPS for the atomic ratio of Ru/Ti is as follows. In RIT-1, the Ru (1.13%)/Ti (31.97%) is 3.53%. In RIT-2, the Ru (1.64%)/Ti (31.19%) is 5.26%. In RIT-3, the Ru (3.11%)/Ti (28.77%) is 10.81%. 3.1.4 Peak deconvolution The XPSPEAK4.0, a commercial available software, was employed in the peak deconvolution process. The baseline was subtraction by Shirley method before the peak deconvolution. Basically, each component peak is assigned to an available binding energy. After the peak deconvolution of XPS spectra, from 278 eV to 289 eV for RIT-1 and RIT-3, the broad peak is divided into two main portions, shown in Fig. 5 (a), and 5(b). The one portion from 278 eV to 282 eV, is adjusted to contain two components: Ru0 3d5/2 and Ru4+ 3d5/2 [15,16,18,19]. The portion, from 282 eV to 289 eV, is determined to have 3 components. There are C1 s, Ru0 3d3/2 and Ru 4+ 3d3/2 [15,16,18,19]. TheX 2 value is pushed to the minimum values, ˜1.86 to ˜1.53. The obtaoned deconvoluted data and theX 2 values are given in Table 1 . Since the location of Ru0, from 280.08 eV to 280.89 eV, and Ru4+, from 284.24 eV to 285.06 eV, are deconvoluted, the atomic ratio of Ru0/ Ru4+ can be obtained by calculation from the deconvoluted data. In Table 1, one can find that the Ru0 and Ru4+ co-exist in all RIT samples. By data calculation, the ratio of peak area for Ru0 /Ru4+ is 1.62 (1352.85/834.79) for RIT-1, and is 0.205 (254.69/1240.62) for RIT-3. The decrease of Ru0 / Ru4+ ratio is due to the obviously decrease of the amount of Ru0 from RIT-1 to RIT-3. The data suggests that the reduction of Ru4+ to Ru0 is a limited reaction. There is no enough photo-induced electrons to perform the reduction of Ru4+ to Ru0, if the incorporated amount of RuO2 is increased over the Ru/Ti ratio of RIT-1. 3.2 Photocatalytic reaction of salicylic acid The photo-degradation mechanism for SA over RIT was explored by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The RIT samples were calcinated at 450 0C for 2 h before the start of photo-degradation reaction. The 365 nm irradiation is selected for the photocatalytic reaction. The band gap, measured by diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) for RIT-3 (425 nm), RIT-2 (418 nm), and RIT-1 (413 nm), show a red-shift as the doping amount of ruthenium oxide increases. Since the band gap of RuO2 (2.5 eV) is smaller than that of titania (3.2 eV), the increase amount of ruthenium oxide in RIT leads to a decrease of band gap in RIT [20–22]. 3.2.1 Photo-catalysis of adsorbed SA The SA could be self-degradation (kself) by UV–vis light in atmosphere. Therefore, the kself rate constant should be subtracted from the data obtained from the PL spectrum. Under 365 nm irradiation for 80 min, the intensity of PL peak decreases slightly, such as 1.28% (20th min), 2.08% (40th min), 3.13% (60th min), and 3.89% (80th min) respectively. The kself derived from the time-involved plot of photo-reaction is (-) 6 × 10−4  min-1. The constants (kcat) calculated from the plot is regarded as the real rate constant, after deduction of the kself. The photo-catalysis of absorbed SA were investigated via the route of high [SA]/[catalyst] ratio, (SA : catalyst = 1 : 1.5). In the case, the reaction was carried out in a close system. According to the Michaelis–Menten equation, the turn over number (TON) will equal to kcat (min−1) derived from the high concentration route [23,24]. The photocatalyst RIT (50 mg) was immersed in SA (1 × 10-5 M, 30 mL), and followed with the nitrogen bubbling before the UV irradiation (18 W). The samples, irradiated for 20 min, 40 min, 60 min, and 80 min, were labeled as a, b, c, d series, respectively. After the filtration of collected solutions, the PL spectra were acquired to measure the concentration of SA in the filtrate. In Fig. 6 (a), a photo-degradation of SA over RIT is shown. In the range from 350 to 550 nm, λmax  = 420 nm, a major peak was recorded for all samples from 0 to 80 min. Before the calculation of kcat values, the PL intensity was normalized by commercial software. In theory, the plot of ln(c/c0) vs. time (min) offers a slope value (R), which equals to the constant kcat.[25] The kcat values for RIT-1 (0.251 min -1), RIT-2 (0.199 min -1), RIT-3 (0.153 min -1) are in the ratio of 1.00: 0.79: 0.61, shown in Fig. 6(b). The obtained TON values from RIT samples match the industrial standard, 0.1 < TON < 100 [25]. The best degradation efficiency was recorded in the RIT-1 experiments. The results suggest that increase of the ruthenium oxide amount in RIT can’t enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of SA over RIT. 3.2.2 Spectrum study for photo-degradation products Theoretically, gas CO2 and H2O are regarded as the final degradation products of organic acid compounds. The gas CO2 can be measured, if the starting reactant concentration is 1 × 10− 4 M or higher [9]. However, in this study, the adsorbed SA is very few, the concentration is much less than 6.6 × 10 -6 M. The PL spectra show that the expected product is aliphatic or aromatic compound(s), not CO2 or H2O, either. Therefore, 13C NMR spectroscopy and LC-mass spectroscopy are the suitable methods to clarify the final compound structures. 3.2.2.1 The 13C NMR spectra The 13C NMR spectra of the stock salicylic solution (1 × 10−5 M), Fig. 7 (a), photo-degraded products from RIT-1, Fig. 7(b), and RIT-3, Fig. 7(c) were measured at RT. The samples were dissolved in DMSO before 13C NMR measurement. By comparison with the 13C NMR spectra, two aspects are concluded. Firstly, the peak for carboxylic acid, at ˜172 ppm [26], is not evident in products collected from RIT-1, and RIT-3. Secondly, a new peak at ˜128 ppm, assigned for 13C peak of benzene [26], is recorded in both Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(c), marked as peak B. However, the intensity of peak B in Fig. 7(b) is stronger than that in Fig. 7(c). Accordingly, two conclusions are proposed. (i) The de-carboxylation reaction was finished in both RIT-1 and RIT-3 routes. The reason is that the carbon peak of −COOH group was negligible in both 13C NMR spectra. (ii) The hydro-deoxygenation reaction was mainly initialized in the RIT-1 route. The final product was benzene. In RIT-3, the hydro-deoxygenation reaction was partially finished because the amount of product (benzene) was small. A detail discussion will be given in the following paragraph. 3.2.2.2 LC-mass spectra The m/e data obtained from the LC mass reveal that the photo-degradation of SA was occurred in all products collected at the 80th min. In the route of RIT-3, four peaks were collected in LC-mass spectrum, Fig. 8 (a). The peaks located at m/e = 94.1 was assigned for phenol, the relative abundance (Ra) = 100%. The peak at m/e = 78.1 was assigned for benzene, the Ra = 5%. The peak at m/e = 137.1, was allocated to C6H4(OH)(COO) − , the Ra = 13%. The peak at m/e = 138.1 was considered as unreacted SA, the Ra = 3.5%. The conversion rate for SA (Xsa) = 83.5%. The selectivity of phenol (Sphenol) = 95.2%. The selectivity of benzene (Sbenzene) = 4.8%. In the route of RIT-1, Fig. 8(b), the collected four peaks were located at m/e = 78.1 (ra = 100%), m/e = 94.1 (ra = 39%), m/e = 137.1 (ra = 18%), and m/e = 138.1 (ra = 4%). The conversion rate for SA (Xsa) = 78%. The selectivity of phenol (Sphenol) = 25.1%. The selectivity of benzene (Sbenzene) = 71.9%. The selectivity of phenol (Sphenol) = 28.1%. The data support that the de-carboxylation and hydro de-oxylation reactions are occurred in all RIT routes. In RIT-3, the de-carboxylation is finished completely. The major product is phenol. In RIT-1, the hydro de-oxylation prevails after the de-carboxlytion. The major product is benzene. By the results obtained from 13C NMR and LC-mass spectra, a photo-degradation mechanism is provided in the next paragraph. 4 Discussion 4.1 The mechanism for de-carboxylic acid reaction In the 13C spectra of RIT-1, Fig. 7(b), and RIT-3, Fig. 7(c), the carbon peak assigned for −COOH group (˜172 ppm) is not evident. The spectra data shows that the de-carboxylic acid reaction is completed in RIT-1 and RIT-3 routes. The key factor to initialize the de-carboxylic acid reaction is the occurrence of photo-induced e–h pairs from the crystalline anatase-structured titania [9,14]. The proposed mechanism is given as follows. (a) RIT + 2(e–) + 1/2 O2 (abs) + H + → RIT + OH – The photo-induced electrons initialize the reaction between absorbed O2 and proton to create the hydroxide ions. The proton is from solvent and the oxygen is from the atmosphere. The hydroxide ion combines with the proton from carboxylic group.to form water. The COO −group donates an electron to aromatic group and turns into a good leaving group CO2. At the final step, the aromatic ring adopts a proton from the solvent to balance the charge of aromatic ring. The degradation reaction is then finished, and the product is phenol. 4.2 The proposed mechanism for hydro-deoxygenation In the cleavage of the Caro OH bonding, the oxophilicity of the metal ion in catalyst is the pivotal factor. Theoretically, Ti 4+ is an ideal oxophilic site because Ti 4+ ion is high-valence with small covalent radius. Moreover, the oxophility of Ti 4+ (1.0) is much higher than that of Ru4+ (0.4) [20,21]. Thus, the ruthenium atom is considered as an ideal base site to trap proton temporally [27,28]. In the catalytic process, the neutral Ru atom attracts proton to its surface by using loosely confined 4d electrons (step 1). Then, the Ti4+ with high oxophilicity attacks the oxygen atom of OH group with the concurrent homolytic cleavage of the σ bond of Caro O bond ing (step 2). Two free radicals ( OH and．C 6H5) are formed. The．OH radical is adopted by titania rapidly. Meanwhile, the Ru-H attacks the Caro site after the homolytic cleavage of Caro O bond ing. This attack favors the proton transfer from Ru atom to Caro site to stablize the C6H5 radical (step 3) [18]. The hydro-deoxygenation reaction is finished. The mechanism is proposed in Scheme 1 . 4.3 The factor to influence the ratio of Ru0 / Ru4+ In the study, the key roles in hydro-deoxygenation are referred to the amount of Ti4+ ions and the concentration of neutral Ru atoms. The hydro-deoxygenation catalysis is initialized by titanium ion and is completed by the proton transfer from ruthenium atom to Caro site. Therefore, the existence of enough amount of Ru0 is a requirement to complete the hydro-deoxygenation catalysis. It is believed that the Ru 0 is converted from the Ru4+ by the photo-induced electrons from e–h pairs. As the incorporated amount of RuO2 increases from Ru/Ti = 3.53% (RIT-1) to Ru/Ti = 10.79% (RIT-3), the ratio of Ru0/ Ru4+ decreases from 1.62 (RIT-1) to 0.205 (RIT-3). The increase of RuO2 amount makes the ratio of Ru0 / Ru4+ decreases. The possible reason is that the available photo-induced electrons created from TiO2 domain are limited. On the basis of data offered in Table 1, we found that only about 17% Ru4+ ions have been reduced to Ru0 in RIT-3, Ru0 / Ru4+ = 0.2053. However, about 61% Ru4+ ions are reduced to Ru0 in RIT-1, Ru0 / Ru4+ = 1.62. The experimental data prove why the RIT-1 shows the best hydro-deoxygenation ability, in comparison with the others RIT samples. 5 Summary A novel bi-functional photocatalyst ruthenium oxide incorporated titania is prepared to show the photo degradation ability for salicylic acid. The de-carboxylation reaction for salicylic acid is related with the existence of titania crystalline domain. The hydro-deoxygenation is required a bi-finctional photocatalyst to perform the catalytic degradation reaction. The bi-functional ability includes the oxophilic site (Ti 4+ site) to chelate the −OH group, and hydrogenating site (Ru 0 site) to transfer the required proton to aromatic ring after the leaving of −OH group. The final product obtained from the photcatalytic reaction is benzene.

        "dc:description": "Ruthenium oxide incorporated titania (RIT) photocatalyst, with verified ruthenium oxide ratio, have been prepared for photo-degradation. In monitoring the photo-catalytic reaction of salicylic acid over RIT, two degradation steps are observed. The first one is the de-carboxylation. The other step is the hydro-deoxygenation. The final product collected from the degradation is benzene. On the basis of experimental results, the photo-induced e–h pair from the crystalline domain of titania in RIT plays the key role in inducing the de-carboxylation degradation. As for the hydro-deoxygenation reaction, the Ru0/ Ru4+ ratio of incorporated ruthenium oxide in RIT is the pivitol factor in the direct cleavage of Caro O bond of phenol. The best selectivity for Caro O bond cleavage (71.9%) is shown in the RIT-1, Ru/Ti = 3.53%, route. If the ratio of Ru/Ti reaches to 10.81% (RIT-3), the selectivity decreases to 4.8%.",
