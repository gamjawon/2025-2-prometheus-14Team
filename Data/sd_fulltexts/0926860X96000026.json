Introduction Many catalytic processes involving hydrocarbons are accompanied by deacti- vation as a result of coke formation. In quantifying the effect of coke on the catalyst activity, knowledge about the rate of coke deposition is necessary [1]. The conventional dynamic microbalance has played an important role in the study of catalyst deactivation [2-6]. The coke content on the catalyst is measured continuously as a function of time and by using on-line gas chro- matography, the catalyst activity and selectivity can be determined.

Chen et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) LI-L8 crobalance reactor allows the main and the coking reaction to be studied simultaneously as a function of the coke content. However, a main disadvantage of the conventional microbalance is that a large part of the feed bypasses the catalyst basket. In order to obtain a uniform coke level and to eliminate the effects of bypass, gradientless operation is necessary [4,7,8], but the large bypass makes it difficult to confirm differential operation in the conventional microbal- ance. A large number of studies concerning the kinetics of deactivation due to coking have been presented [4,5,9-11]. In many cases the reaction and the coking rates have been calculated from experimental data obtained in a conven- tional microbalance, assuming differential conversion. However, it is usually very difficult to give a theoretical or experimental confirmation of gradientless operation. Due to the inherent poor contact between the flowing gas and the catalyst suspended in the basket, this approximation might be valid only for low reaction rates. The significance of reactants, products or coke gradients in the catalyst bed for rapid reactions has been demonstrated by GrOnvold [7]. Recently a new microbalance reactor system has been developed [12,13] where the problems of bypass are avoided. An inertial microbalance (TEOM -- tapered element oscillating microbalance) is used to weigh the catalyst bed. Changes in the catalyst mass located at the tip of an oscillating tapered quartz element are detected as a change in its vibrational frequency. One of the major advantages of the new design is that it provides a packed bed of catalyst through which all the gas is forced to flow. The classical methods of testing for differential operation in a fixed-bed reactor can therefore also be used with the TEOM. This technique provides an excellent opportunity to compare results obtained at differential conditions with the corresponding data obtained in a conventional microbalance reactor. The present study deals with deactivation studies during ethene oligomeriza- tion over H-ZSM-5. The reaction suffers from catalyst deactivation by coking and the rates involved make the reaction a good choice as a model reaction [14]. The reaction has been studied in a conventional microbalance reactor, in the oscillating TEOM microbalance reactor as well as in a differential fixed-bed laboratory reactor. The importance of concentration and temperature gradients in the basket on the deactivation kinetics was confirmed using different catalyst loadings and flow rates. The shortcomings of the conventional microbalance are illustrated and discussed. 2.

A Rupprecht and Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass analyzer was used in an experimental set-up designed for steady-state, pulse and step experiments. The TEOM reactor has an excellent sensitivity and stability for long time catalyst deactivation studies and detects a mass change as low as a few micrograms. The experimental set-up is illustrated in Fig. I. Reactants and inert gases are metered to the unit using mass flow controllers. Helium is used as the carrier gas, the diluting agent and as purge gas. Air is used for calcination as well as for regeneration of the catalyst. Part of the reactor effluent was split to a six-way valve which directed the products either to vent or to the inlet splitter of the GC. The product composi- tion was analyzed by an on-line GC (HP5890) using FID and a GC-Q capillary column (30 m, 0.543 ram). The tapered element was loaded with 5 to 30 mg of zeolite particles (0.074-0.297 mm) together with quartz particles. Quartz wool was used on the top and bottom of the catalyst bed to keep the catalyst particles firmly packed. Quartz particles of identical size as the catalyst particles were installed between the catalyst and the quartz wool to minimize radial temperature and concentra- tion gradients. Another set of experiments was carried out in a C.I. Mark 2B conventional dynamic microbalance fitted with a tubular quartz reactor (I 5 mm I.D.). The reactor system has been described elsewhere [15]. The catalyst was placed in a quartz basket (8 mm I.D.) with quartz wool covering the perforated bottom of the basket. Different catalyst loadings (0.005-0.025 g) were used, in order to check for gradients in the basket. In addition, some experiments were also carried out using the reactor as an ordinary fixed-bed quartz reactor by simply replacing the quartz basket with a catalyst bed of identical diameter as the tubular quartz reactor. The template-free ammonium form of the ZSM-5 zeolite CBV 8020 with a Si/AI ratio of 39, average crystal size of 0.3-0.6 /~m and a surface area of 450 m2/g (P/Po = 0.03) was obtained from PQ Zeolites. The sample was calcined in-situ at 500 for 12 h in diluted air (10% 02). The experiments were all performed at 450 and 1 bar, and with a mole fraction of ethene in the feed equal to 0.3. The rate of ethene oligomerization decreases with time on stream due to coke deposition. The initial rate (in the absence of coke) was determined by extrapolation to zero time. The first GC analysis was taken after 5 min. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows the initial conversion of ethene in the fixed-bed reactor and in the microbalance reactors for various space times (W/Fo). The space time was D.

The initial conversion vs. space time was found to depend on the reactor type and on the catalyst loading. A linear relationship passing through zero was found between the initial conversion and the space time in the fixed-bed reactor for an initial conversion less than 5%. It can therefore be concluded that the fixed-bed reactor was operated differentially without any mass and heat transfer limitations at those low conversions [ 16]. Similar experiments in the conventional microbalance gave a straight line through zero when the flow rate was varied for a given sample weight. It is difficult to know the true space time due to the bypass of the catalyst basket. A mass balance over the reactor gives: XA,me~ = XA\" (] - 8) where XA is the true conversion over the catalyst in the basket, XA,mea~ iS the measured or apparent conversion over the reactor, and 8 is the bypass fraction. If the microbalance reactor is operated differentially, the true reaction rate can be calculated as shown in Eq. (2) where FA0 is the molar feed rate of reactant A: XA XA, meas r= W = W FA0(l - 8) FAo A linear dependence of the apparent conversion on the overall space time was found for each catalyst loading in the conventional microbalance. However, such a result cannot be used to confirm differential operation, since the slope of L6 D.

Amount of catalyst in the basket of the conventional microbalance: 7 rag, I0 rag, 15 mg and 25 mg; 30 mg catalyst in TEOM reactor. the curve increased with increasing catalyst loading. For a certain catalyst loading, a significant decrease in the apparent conversion was observed with increasing flow rate, whereas the coking rate was only slightly changed. The coking rate, however, was largely dependent on the catalyst loading as shown in Fig. 3. This indicates that the amount of reactant passing through the basket increased only slightly with increasing total flow rate and the decrease in the apparent conversion is mainly due to an increase in the bypass fraction, as seen from Eq. (1). The flow rate through the basket is small and bed diffusion can be considered as the dominant mode of mass transport [7]. The reaction rate found for more than 7 mg catalyst in the basket was higher than the rate found in the TEOM or in the fixed-bed reactor. Also, the conversion rapidly increased at higher overall space times (Fig. 2). Since ethene oligomerization is an exothermic reaction, the results indicate that significant temperature gradients existed in the basket. Differential operation of the TEOM reactor was confirmed by the same method as for the fixed-bed reactor. Thus, the TEOM can be used to determine the rates of the main reaction and of the coking reaction under controlled conditions. The rate of coke formation was much lower than the rates observed in the conventional microbalance (Fig. 3) where the coking rate increased with increasing catalyst loading with constant overall space time (Fig. 3). This is due to the fact that coke formation is a secondary reaction, and therefore depends on the concentration of products. By reducing the amount of catalyst in the basket, the rate of coke formation approaches the value found from the TEOM. An experiment with 5 mg catalyst gave almost the same reaction rate as for the TEOM (Fig. 2), but a reliable coking rate could not be obtained due to the high signal to noise ratio at this very low catalyst loading.

Deactivation functions (r/r(~) versus coke content obtained from the TEOM microbalance ( ) and in the conventional microbalance at 7 mg ( [] ), I 0 mg ( ), 15 mg( + ) and 25 mg (~) catalyst loading. Based on these results, the following conception of the microbalance is proposed: The pressure drop over the basket should be the same as the pressure drop outside the basket, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that most of the gases bypass the basket, due to a much larger flow resistance in the catalyst layer in the basket. Bed diffusion will then be the dominant mode of transport through the catalyst in the basket. Whether the reactor is operated differentially or not depends on the catalyst loading (or the bed height) and the nature of the reaction (reaction rate and heat of reaction). It is not necessarily sufficient to employ a high flow rate to avoid transport limitations in the case of high reaction rates. The TEOM was operated differentially and the activity of the catalyst can be directly correlated with the coke content to obtain the true deactivation function both for the main reaction and for the coking reaction. The deactivation function for the conversion of ethene is compared with the values obtained from the conventional microbalance in Fig. 4. The deactivation function for both reactors was calculated as r/ro versus the coke content, where r is the reaction rate at a given coke content, calculated from Eq. (2). Fig. 4 shows a large deviation between the two microbalance reactors and that the difference increases with increasing catalyst loading. The deviation is in part due to the non-uniform coke distribution in the catalyst in the basket, but also due to the use of a differential model to calculate the reaction rate in the conventional microbalance. The non-uniform coking in the catalyst basket makes it very difficult to obtain true deactivation functions. By reducing the amount of catalyst in the conventional microbalance, the deactivation function approaches the true deactivation func- tion obtained from the TEOM as shown in Fig. 4. However, lower loadings than 7 mg in the microbalance reactor made the weight measurements inaccurate. L8 D. Chen et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) LI-L8 4. Conclusions Concentration and temperature gradients were found to exist in the catalyst basket of the conventional microbalance reactor during ethene oligomerization, even when the measured conversion was less than 2%. Bed diffusion was the dominant mode of mass and heat transport through the basket. Operating under high flow rates is not sufficient to avoid these gradients, which were found to depend on the depth of the catalyst layer and the nature of the reaction. If these gradients in the basket are not taken into account, interpretation of deactivation functions may lead to erroneous results. The novel TEOM microbalance is a powerful tool to study deactivation kinetics, with a design making the true space time easy to obtain. The reaction rate and coking rate can be easily obtained under differential operation. It combines the advantages of the conventional microbalance and the fixed bed reactor and the same criteria used to check for differential operation in a fixed bed reactor can be used in the TEOM microbalance.
