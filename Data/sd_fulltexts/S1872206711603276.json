DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60327-6 Low-Temperature Water-Gas Shift Reaction over Au/ZrO 2 Catalysts Using Hydrothermally Synthesized Zirconia as Supports ZHANG Yanjie, ZHAN Yingying, CAO Yanning, CHEN Chongqi, LIN Xingyi, ZHENG Qi* National Engineering Research Center for Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: Au/ZrO 2 catalysts with a nominal gold loading of 1.0% were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method employing a series of ZrO 2 samples synthesized by a convenient hydrothermal route as supports. These catalysts were evaluated for low-temperature water-gas shift reaction under a model reformed methanol gas atmosphere. The effect of the hydrothermal synthesis temperature of zirconia on the catalytic activity of Au/ZrO 2 was investigated. The optimal hydrothermal synthesis temperature of ZrO 2 was 150 Â°C. The corresponding catalyst offers a CO conversion of 87% at a reaction temperature of 240 Â°C, which is significantly higher than that of the previously reported Au/Fe 2 O 3 , Au/CeO 2 , and Au/CeZrO 4 catalysts. The Au/ZrO 2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spec- trometry, N 2 -physisorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate that the catalytic performance of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts is mainly influenced by the morphology and pore structure of the ZrO 2 that was hydrothermally synthesized at different temperatures. A uniform nanodisk morphology and increase in the pore volume and pore diameter of the ZrO 2 particles lead to a higher catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO 2 catalyst. Key words: hydrothermal method; hydrothermal synthesis temperature; gold; zirconia; supported catalyst; water-gas shift reaction The water-gas shift reaction (CO + H 2 O CO 2 + H 2 , H = 41.2 kJ/mol, G = 28.6 kJ/mol, WGS) is mainly used to purify the reformed gas and to supply pure H 2 for ammonia and other chemical synthesis processes. Recently, this reaction has attracted renewed attention because of its application in on-line H 2 production to fuel proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [1,2]. Gold supported catalysts are regarded as the most promising low-temperature WGS catalysts for use under the harsh operating conditions of PEMFCs because of their superior low-temperature catalytic efficiency, wide operating temperature range, and excellent oxidation-tolerant and wa- ter-tolerant properties [3,4]. It has been established that gold supported catalysts such as Au/Fe 2 O 3 [5â€“7], Au/CeO 2 [8â€“11], Au/TiO 2 [12], Au/ThO 2 [13], Au/Cu x Mn y O z [14], Au/CeZrO 4 [15â€“17], and Au/ZrO 2 [5,18â€“23] give high catalytic activity in the low-temperature WGS reaction. The Au/ZrO 2 system has been of great interest because of its excellent catalytic performance. The physical properties of ZrO 2 such as its crystal phase [18], parti- cle/crystallite size [19], density of surface hydroxyl groups [19], and specific surface area [20] were found to strongly influence the catalytic performance of Au/ZrO 2 catalysts for the low-temperature WGS reaction. For instance, Au nanopar- ticles supported on monoclinic zirconia exhibited higher WGS activity than that on tetragonal zirconia [18] and the increase in the particle size of ZrO 2 caused a significant decrease in Au-ZrO 2 contact boundaries i.e. active sites for the WGS re- action [19]. Considering that the physical properties of ZrO 2 are directly affected by the preparation method, it is critical to choose a suitable ZrO 2 preparation method to improve the catalytic efficiency of the Au/ZrO 2 catalyst to investigate the structure-property relation of the catalysts and to further guide the design of new catalysts. ZrO 2 supports for Au/ZrO 2 cata- lysts have been mainly synthesized by a reflux method [18,19], a precipitation method [5,20â€“22], and a template-directed hydrothermal method [23] while no reports have focused on ZHANG Yanjie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 230â€“236 the preparation of Au/ZrO 2 catalysts with ZrO 2 synthesized by a template-free hydrothermal method. In this paper, a series of ZrO 2 samples were prepared from a ZrOCl 2 aqueous solution by hydrolysis under hydrothermal conditions and used as supports for Au/ZrO 2 catalysts. The effects of hydrothermal synthesis temperature of zirconia on the structural properties and low-temperature WGS catalytic activity of Au/ZrO 2 were investigated. A typical ZrO 2 hydrothermal synthesis was carried out as follows. ZrOCl 2 Â·8H 2 O aqueous solution (60 ml, 0.40 mol/L) was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel auto- clave and this was maintained at different hydrothermal tem- peratures for 6 h. The resultant precipitate was then washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried at 120 Â°C for 8 h, and calcined at 450 Â°C in static air for 4 h. The support is denoted ZrO 2 -t, where t refers to the hydrothermal temperature of ZrO 2 . The Au/ZrO 2 catalysts with a nominal Au loading of 1.0% were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method using KOH as the precipitating agent. The catalyst samples are denoted Au/ZrO 2 -t. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for the structure determination were carried out with a PANalytical Xâ€™Pert Pro diffractometer using Co K radiation ( = 0.1790 nm) and the scanning speed was 0.25Â°/s. The actual loading of gold in each catalyst was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) on a Varian SpectrAA-220 atomic ab- sorption spectrometer. The specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were measured at 196 Â°C on a Mi- cromeritics ASAP 2020 physical adsorption analyzer. A Hi- tachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the catalysts. The catalytic activity of the samples for the WGS reaction was measured from 150 to 300 Â°C on a CO-CMAT9001 ap- paratus that was equipped with a flow reactor. The preliminar- ily pretreatment of the samples was performed under a H 2 atmosphere at 300 Â°C over 2 h in a tubular-furnace and then the samples were quickly transferred to the reactor tube after cooling to ambient temperature under the H 2 flow. The fol- lowing testing conditions were applied: atmospheric pressure; catalyst 0.5 g; space velocity = 10000 cm 3 /(gÂ·h); feed gas was a model reformed methanol gas containing 10% CO, 60% H 2 , 12% CO 2 , and balance was N 2 ; the ratio of vapor to feed gas was 1. The concentration of CO in the effluent was analyzed on-line using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The catalytic activity of the gold-zirconia catalysts for the low-temperature WGS reaction is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in this figure, significant differences in CO conversion were found for the samples over the whole testing temperature re- gion. The catalytic activity decreased as follows: Au/ZrO 2 -150 > Au/ZrO 2 -170 > Au/ZrO 2 -190 > Au/ZrO 2 -130, i.e. with an increase in the hydrothermal synthesis temperature of ZrO 2 , the catalytic activity of the resultant Au/ZrO 2 catalysts increased initially and then decreased and gave a maximum at the hydrothermal temperature of 150 Â°C. The influence of the hydrothermal temperature of ZrO 2 on the catalytic performance of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts may be related to differences in the physical properties of the catalysts. Although the real gold loading is just 0.88% (Table 1), the Au/ZrO 2 -150 sample gives a CO conversion of 87% at the reaction temperature of 240 Â°C, which is significantly higher than that of the reported 8.0% Au/Fe 2 O 3 [7], 3.0% Au/CeO 2 [11], and 3.0% Au/CeZrO 4 [17] catalysts (conversion is 64%, 15%, and 69%, respectively). In other words, the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts with the ZrO 2 support pre- pared by the hydrothermal method can maintain high catalytic activity even though the gold content is very low, which is of great commercial value. To investigate the reason for the difference in catalytic ac- tivity of the samples, several characterization methods were used. XRD patterns for the gold-based samples pretreated in hydrogen are shown in Fig. 2. All the diffraction peaks are related to the monoclinic phase of zirconia (JCPDS 01-089-9066) and no characteristic peaks of metallic gold are present (typical 2 of 44.7Â°, JCPDS 01-089-3697), suggesting a high dispersion of gold particles on the support surface. With an increase in the hydrothermal temperature the XRD peaks of ZrO 2 become sharp and intense, indicating that the crystalliza- tion process is very effective. The corresponding crystallite size of the ZrO 2 particles calculated using the Scherrer equa- tion increases from 3.0 to 7.4 nm (Table 1). Based on the catalytic activity results, the catalytic behavior of the catalysts correlates well with the crystallite size of the ZrO 2 particles for Au/ZrO 2 -150, Au/ZrO 2 -170, and Au/ZrO 2 -190, i.e. smaller zirconia nanoparticles lead to a higher catalytic activity for the Au/ZrO 2 catalyst, which is consistent with the results reported by Li et al. [19] and Zhang et al. [24]. The improvement in activity upon reducing the ZrO 2 crystallite size is attributed to the increased Au-ZrO 2 contact boundaries in the catalysts [19,24], which are regarded as active sites in the WGS reaction. 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 C O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Temperature ( o C) Au/ZrO 2 -130 Au/ZrO 2 -150 Au/ZrO 2 -170 Au/ZrO 2 -190 Fig. 1.

ZHANG Yanjie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 230â€“236 However, the Au/ZrO 2 -130 sample is an exception because it has the lowest CO conversion even though it has the smallest ZrO 2 crystallite size. Therefore, other important factors de- termine the catalytic activities of these catalysts in addition to the crystal structure. The actual gold loading and structural and textural proper- ties of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts are shown in Table 1. All the samples have a very similar gold loading of about 0.90% and there is no correlation between the BET surface area and the resulting catalytic activity, indicating that these two parameters are not crucial factors that affect the catalytic performance of the samples. As shown in Table 1, the pore structure of the catalysts is significantly affected by the hydrothermal synthesis temperature. The pore volume and average pore diameter of the samples increased initially and then decreased with an increase in the hydrothermal temperature and they reached a maximum at 150 Â°C, which coincides with the change in catalytic activity. In other words, a larger pore volume and a larger average pore diameter lead to a higher catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO 2 catalyst. The Au/ZrO 2 -150 sample with the largest pore volume and average pore diameter gave the highest WGS catalytic activity. In contrast, the Au/ZrO 2 -130 sample with the smallest pore volume and average pore diameter gave the lowest WGS catalytic activity. A similar relationship between the pore di- ameter and the catalytic activity with respect to the Au/Ce 1-x Zr x O 2 WGS catalysts was reported by Liao et al. [16], who suggested that a benefit of the large pore diameter was the promotion of gold dispersion on the surface of the supports. In addition, Tabakova et al. [5] showed that the deactivation of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts for the low-temperature WGS reaction was mainly attributed to a reduction in pore volume, suggesting the importance of a large pore volume for high catalytic activity. Actually, a large pore diameter and a large pore volume greatly benefit the transfer of reactant/product molecules into or out of the pores in the catalysts and, therefore, they contribute to a higher reaction rate. Figure 3 shows SEM images of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts. We observe that the ZrO 2 particles synthesized at various hydro- thermal temperatures give different morphologies and particle size distributions and are composed of many primary crystal grains with different arrangements. The ZrO 2 particles synthe- sized at 130 Â°C do not have a specific morphology and they agglomerate into larger clumps wherein the primary crystal grains are arranged in a disorderly manner. As the hydrother- mal temperature reaches 150 Â°C, the ZrO 2 particles have a well-developed nanodisk shape with a diameter of about 150 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 Au/ZrO 2 -190 Au/ZrO 2 -170 Au/ZrO 2 -150 I n t e n s i t y 2 /( o ) Au ZrO2 Au/ZrO 2 -130 Fig. 2.

ZHANG Yanjie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 230â€“236 nm and a thickness of about 50 nm. No agglomeration is ob- served in this sample. For the Au/ZrO 2 -170 sample the major- ity of the ZrO 2 particles maintain their nanodisk morphology with a smaller particle size compared to the Au/ZrO 2 -150 sample. This is accompanied by a small proportion of the par- ticles losing their specific morphological features. In addition, agglomeration occurs in this sample as well. For the Au/ZrO 2 -190 sample the ZrO 2 particles have an irregular nanodisk shape with a diameter of 50â€“150 nm and pores with a diameter of 10 nm are clearly observed on the surface of these ZrO 2 particles indicating that the ZrO 2 crystallite size increases greatly, which is in agreement with the XRD result. The ar- rangement of the ZrO 2 primary crystal grains changes from being disordered to ordered and then disordered again with an increase in the hydrothermal temperature. Correspondingly, the ZrO 2 particles change from a state without specific morphol- ogy to a state with uniform nanodisk morphology and finally to a state with an irregular nanodisk morphology. A possible reason is that under hydrothermal conditions the ZrO 2 sepa- rates from the precursor aqueous solution by a precipitation mechanism from the supersaturated solution [25]. At a lower hydrothermal temperature (130 Â°C), the precipitation or crys- tallization of ZrO 2 is too slow to give rise to a specific mor- phology within a relatively short period of time. However, if the hydrothermal temperature is too high (such as 170 and 190 Â°C), the crystallization will be so fast that ZrO 2 can not form a regular morphology. On the contrary, at a suitable temperature (150 Â°C) the ZrO 2 primary crystal grains separate out at a moderate rate and are thus ready to develop a specific regular morphology of ZrO 2 secondary particles. Combined with the catalytic activity results it is clear that the best WGS catalytic activity of Au/ZrO 2 -150 is related to the uniform nanodisk morphology of the ZrO 2 support that was constructed by the regularly arranged ZrO 2 crystal grains. The packing of particles with uniform nanodisk shape is favorable for the formation of larger secondary pores. In addition, the surface of ZrO 2 -150 may preferentially expose certain crys- tallographic planes that act as the catalytically active planes for the WGS reaction. Both of these factors enhance the catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO 2 -150 sample. A number of papers con- cerned with the active crystallographic plane of the catalysts have been published [26,27]. In summary, a series of ZrO 2 samples were prepared by a facile hydrothermal route and were used as supports for low-content (< 1.0%) Au/ZrO 2 catalysts. These catalysts ex- hibit promising catalytic efficiency for the low-temperature WGS reaction. The Au/ZrO 2 -150 sample showed significantly higher activity than that of the reported Au/Fe 2 O 3 , Au/CeO 2 , and Au/CeZrO 4 catalysts. The ZrO 2 samples that were synthe- sized at different hydrothermal temperatures gave various pore structures and morphologies, which are shown to be decisive factors that influence the catalytic performance of the Au/ZrO 2 catalysts. The uniform nanodisk morphology and the increases in pore volume and pore diameter of the ZrO 2 support are responsible for the high catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO 2 catalyst.

Nature, 2009, 458: 746 wever, if the hydrothermal temperature is too high (such as 170 and 190 Â°C), the crystallization will be so fast that ZrO 2 can not form a regular morphology. On the contrary, at a suitable temperature (150 Â°C) the ZrO 2 primary crystal grains separate out at a moderate rate and are thus ready to develop a specific regular morphology of ZrO 2 secondary particles. Combined with the catalytic activity results it is clear that the best WGS catalytic activity of Au/ZrO 2 -150 is related to the uniform nanodisk morphology of the ZrO 2 support that CHNJC 60327 S1872-2067(11)60327-6 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60327-6 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (20771025) and the A-Type Science and Technology Projects of Fujian Provincial Department of Education (JA08021). COMMUNICATION Low-Temperature Water-Gas Shift Reaction over Au/ZrO2 Catalysts Using Hydrothermally Synthesized Zirconia as Supports Yanjie ZHANG Yingying ZHAN Yanning CAO Chongqi CHEN Xingyi LIN Qi ZHENG * National Engineering Research Center for Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-591-83731234-8110 Au/ZrO2 catalysts with a nominal gold loading of 1.0% were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method employing a series of ZrO2 samples synthesized by a convenient hydrothermal route as supports. These catalysts were evaluated for low-temperature water-gas shift reaction under a model reformed methanol gas atmosphere. The effect of the hydrothermal synthesis temperature of zirconia on the catalytic activity of Au/ZrO2 was investigated. The optimal hydrothermal synthesis temperature of ZrO2 was 150 °C. The corresponding catalyst offers a CO conversion of 87% at a reaction temperature of 240 °C, which is significantly higher than that of the previously reported Au/Fe2O3, Au/CeO2, and Au/CeZrO4 catalysts. The Au/ZrO2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spectrometry, N2-physisorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate that the catalytic performance of the Au/ZrO2 catalysts is mainly influenced by the morphology and pore structure of the ZrO2 that was hydrothermally synthesized at different temperatures. A uniform nanodisk morphology and increase in the pore volume and pore diameter of the ZrO2 particles lead to a higher catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO2 catalyst. 摘要 采用一种简便的水热法合成了一系列 ZrO2, 并采用沉积-沉淀法制得相应 1.0% Au/ZrO2 催化剂, 在模拟甲醇重整气气氛下评价了它们的低温水煤气变换 (WGS) 反应催化性能. 结果发现, 于 150 oC 水热合成的 ZrO2 负载的 Au 催化剂活性最佳, 240 oC 反应时 CO 转化率达 87%, 明显高于相同反应条件下 Au 负载量较高的 Au/Fe2O3, Au/CeO2 及 Au/CeZrO4 催化剂. 采用 X 射线衍射、原子吸收光谱、N2 物理吸脱附及扫描电子显微镜等手段对样品进行了表征. 结果表明, Au/ZrO2 催化剂的总孔体积及平均孔径越大、圆形片状形貌越规整, 其低温 WGS 催化活性就越高. Graphical abstract Au/ZrO2 catalysts with hydrothermally synthesized ZrO2 as supports show excellent catalytic activity for the low-temperature WGS reaction. The nanodisk morphology and the larger pore volume and size benefit the performance of the Au/ZrO2 catalysts.
