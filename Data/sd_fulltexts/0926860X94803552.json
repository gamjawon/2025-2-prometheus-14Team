Bong Yang', Seong Ihl Woo*, Young Gul Kim2 Department of Chemical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, 305-701, South Korea (Received 20 September 1993; revised 31 March 1994; accepted 21 April 1994) Abstract The characteristics and activity, selectivity and stability of Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts supported on y-A1203 and HY-zeolite were examined using hydrogen chemisorption on catalysts calcined at different temperatures as well as by catalyst performance for n-hexane reforming at 573-773 K and atmospheric pressure. All the catalysts used in this study were prepared by impregnation. The Pt-Ir/ HY and Pt-1r/A1203 calcined at 773 K did not exhibit severe oxidative agglomeration, in contrast to monometallic iridium catalysts, and their activity and selectivity in n-hexane reforming were quite different from those of monometallic platinum or iridium catalysts. The catalysts supported on HYzeolite showed high activity for isomerization while Y-A1203-supported catalysts had high activity for dehydrocyclization. Deactivation with reaction time was much more pronounced on HY-zeolitesupported catalysts. Pt-Ir catalysts supported on A1203 and HY showed high selectivity and activity to high-octane value hydrocarbons when the both metals were present in equal amount, 0.5 wt: 9'0. Especially the HY-zeolite-supported Pt-Ir bimetallic catalyst showed a good performance for producing high-octane hydrocarbons containing less amounts of aromatic compounds. It may be concluded that the nature of the support greatly affected the catalytic properties of Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts for n-hexane reforming.

Yang et al. lApplied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 229-241 stimulated much research work on bimetallic catalysts in recent years. In particular, there has been a great deal of work done on platinum-iridium bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina [ 3-6 ] . These studies have shown that Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher and more sustained activity and higher selectivity for aromatization and isomerization of pure hydrocarbons and naphtha reforming than monometallic platinum catalysts. For alumina-supported Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts, the formation of bimetallic clusters [4], as well as the agglomeration and dispersion of metal clusters [ 5 ] have been studied. The reduction state of rhenium metal [ 7 ] , the role of rhenium and sulfur in the reforming reaction [ 8 ] , and the evidence for alloy formation [9] were also investigated on alumina-supported Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts. In forthcoming years, aromatic components in gasoline should be significantly reduced to meet the legislation for environmental protection. Because of the necessity to use crude oil with a high content of sulfur, nitrogen and heavy metal compounds in the petroleum reforming process, the need exists to develop catalysts that have a higher activity, higher selectivity for high-octane value and low aromatics reformate, higher resistance to coking and higher tolerance toward sulfur and heavy metals. Zeolites, widely used as hydrocracking catalysts, are resistant to nitrogen and sulfur compounds [ 10] , have molecular shape selectivity [ 11 ] , and have a high activity toward light alkane isomerization when used as a support for platinum catalysts, and therefore it is to be expected that bimetallic catalysts supported on Y-zeolite may be stable toward sulfur and nitrogen compounds and give improved selectivity for high-octane value hydrocarbons containing less amounts of aromatic compounds, as well as a higher yield of reformate. In this work, a Pt-Ir bimetallic catalyst and monometallic platinum and iridium catalysts supported on y-A1203 and HY-zeolite were prepared by impregnation and the effects of the two supports on the activity, selectivity and stability in n-hexane reforming at atmospheric pressure as well as the hydrogen chemisorption capacity as a function of calcination temperature are reported. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Supports were obtained from Strem Chemical Co. y-A1203 was used as received, whereas HY-zeolite was made by calcining NH4Y-zeolite for 12 h at 773 K in an air stream of 100 ml/min. Platinum and iridium monometallic catalysts were prepared by impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of H2PtC16 and H21rCI6, respectively. Pt-Ir bimetallic catalyst was prepared by co-impregnating the support with a mixture of H2PtCl6 and H21rCI6 solutions. The catalysts are designated by metal (loading, wt.-%) /support. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried in an oven for 12 h at 353 K and calcined in oxygen (100 ml/min/g catal.) for 4 h at O.B.

Before reaction or hydrogen chemisorption, the catalysts were reduced for 2 h at 673 K in a stream of hydrogen (60 ml/min). The experimental details of calcination and reduction are described in a previous work [ 12] . 2.2. Hydrogen chemisorption Hydrogen chemisorption runs were made in a conventional high vacuum Pyrex apparatus at room temperature. The reduced catalyst was evacuated at 10-5 Torr (1 Torr=133.3 Pa) and 673 K for 1 h to remove hydrogen chemisorbed during the reduction and then cooled to 298 K for the chemisorption experiment. The amount of hydrogen chemisorbed irreversibly per metal atom was obtained by the same method as described previously [ 12] and reported in Table 1. 2.3. n-Hexane reforming n-Hexane reforming was carried out in a continuous flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The amount of the catalyst used in each experiment was 0.2 g. The H2/n-hexane (5 / 1) reaction mixture was generated by bubbling hydrogen through a n-hexane saturator kept at 304.6 K. The total flow-rate of the gas mixture was 54 ml/ min (STP). Reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (HP 5840A) equipped with a 20 ft. long, 8 in. column packed with chromosorbW containing 17o squalane. Reaction products were classified as light hydrocarbons (CI through C5, C,-CS), skeletal C6 isomers (i-C6), methylcyclopentane (MCP) and benzene. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hydrogen chemisorption Table 1 shows the results of hydrogen chemisorption on the catalysts calcined at 573 and 773 K, respectively. The metal dispersion of platinum supported on 232 O.B. Yang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 229-241 alumina is known to be nearly unaffected by increase in calcination temperature [ 3 ] . In this study, there was only a slight decrease in platinum metal dispersion, from 0.62 to 0.50, when the calcination temperature increased from 573 K to 773 K. However, platinum supported on HY-zeolite suffered a substantial loss in dispersion, from 0.65 to 0.37, under the same conditions. This may be due to the movement of platinum metal to the zeolite's external surface with subsequent agglomeration. It has been reported that the chemisorption capacity of Ir(0.5) / A1203 is greatly reduced at higher calcination temperature [ 2-4. ] . Our results confirm this. In the case of Ir (0.5) /HY also, there is a drastic reduction in hydrogen chemisorption at higher calcination temperature. This may be attributed, as did Sinfelt and co-workers [ 2,4 ] and Carter et al. [ 3 ] , to the formation of large Ir02 crystallites when calcined in air or oxygen atmosphere at 773 K, which in turn were further converted to large iridium crystallites when treated with hydrogen. It is noteworthy that the dispersion of the bimetallic catalyst exceeds the average value of the constituent monometallic catalysts, suggesting an improved stability of bimetallic catalysts at high temperature. Sinfelt and co-workers [ 2,4] suggested that the dispersion of Pt-Ir catalysts did not decrease at higher calcination temperature, unlike iridium monometallic catalysts, because platinum and iridium bimetallic clusters were formed. 3.2. n-Hexane reforming Effects of calcination temperature Alumina-supported catalysts Fig. 1 shows the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity. Ir(1) / A1203 calcined at 573 K has the highest activity. However, it decreased significantly when the catalyst was calcined at 773 K. This is ascribed to significant agglomeration of iridium metal during the calcination at 773 K as shown by hydrogen chemisorption. Pt( 1) /A1203 and Pt(0.5) Ir(0.5) /A1203 bimetallic catalysts exhibit similar activities, and decrease slightly in activity with the calcination temperature. At higher calcination temperature the stability of Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5)/A1203 is higher than that of Ir(1) /A1203 as reported previously [2,4]. Fig. 2 shows the effect of calcination temperature on the product distribution. Methane is dominant among the light hydrocarbons (C,-CS). The major components in the skeletal isomers (i-C6) of n-hexane are 2- and 3-methylpentane and small amounts of 2,2- and 2,3-dimethylbutane are observed. Hydrocarbons higher than C6 are not produced over any of the catalysts. The product distribution for Pt(l)/A1203 is benzene > MCP > i-C6 > C1-CS in decreasing order and this order does not change with calcination temperature. Ir(1) /A1203 shows 70% C,CS (ca. 50% methane), 25% benzene, 5% skeletal isomers (i-C6) and no MCP. The amounts of light hydrocarbons decrease but the amount of benzene increases after calcination of Ir(1) /A1203 at 773 K, which can be explained by the decrease O.B.

Benzene is a main component on Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5)/A1203, and as the calcination temperature increases to 773 K, light hydrocarbons decrease greatly, benzene increases slightly and MCP increases as much as a factor of 2. A similar product distribution is observed on Pt (1) /A1203 except for a slightly higher selectivity to light hydrocarbons. Sinfelt and co-workers [2,4] reported that Pt-Ir/A1203 catalysts calcined at 773 K might be characterized approximately as systems containing two different types of metallic entities, one consisting of highly dispersed platinum or platinum-rich clusters and the other consisting of large iridium or iridium-rich crystallites. Table 2 shows the Ct/C3 mole ratio in the products at the reaction temperature of 673 K. It has been known that most of the methane is formed on metal site by hydrogenolysis and propene is mostly formed on acid site by carbonium ion chemistry [ 13,14] .

The CI /C3 mole ratios of Pt(l)/A1203 and Ir(1) /A1203 catalysts are ca. 2 and above 7, respectively, indicating the high hydrogenolysis activity of iridium as known from previous work [ 16] . The CI /C3 ratio of Pt(1) /A1203 virtually does not change when increasing the calcination temperature. However, the CI /C3 ratios of Ir(1) /A1203 Calcined at 773 K decrease greatly, which is consistent with hydrogen chemisorption results, indicating a large oxidative agglomeration of iridium at 773 K (Table 1) . The Ct / C3 mole ratios of Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5) /A1203 slightly decrease from ca. 4 to ca. 3 as the calcination temperature increases from 573 K to 773 K. The mole ratios of CI /C3 on alumina-supported catalysts are almost constant in spite of the catalyst's deactivation with reaction time, indicating the same degree of coking on metal and alumina sites. HY-supported catalyst Fig. 3 shows the effect of calcination temperature on catalytic activity as a function of reaction time. The activity of lr(1) /HY is lower than that of Ir(1) / A1203, which may be due to the lower metal dispersion as shown in Table 1. As 236 O.B.

However, the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5) /HY is not so large as compared with that of Ir(1) /Al203. Pt(1) /HY and Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5) /HY start at a higher activity and steadily decrease with reaction time. After a reaction time of 185 min, these activities reach a level similar to that of Pt( 1) /AI203 and Pt(0.5 )Ir(0.5 ) /Al203. Fig. 4 shows the effect of calcination temperature on the product distributions of HY-supported catalysts. The main products are skeletal isomers (i-C6) containing mostly 2- and 3-methylpentane, some 2,2- and 2,3-dimethylbutane and cyclohexane. MCP and benzene selectivities of HY-supported catalysts are significantly lower than those of alumina-supported catalysts. Especially the MCP selectivity is very low. It is known that five-membered ring compounds such as MCP are notorious coke precursors, whereas six-membered ring compounds do not readily form coke. The severe deactivation of HY-supported catalysts may be due to the coke derived from MCP. Therefore, a cyclic reaction mechanism [ 17] which involves a MCP intermediate can be applied to explain the isomerization of n-hexane and the severe deactivation of HY-supported catalysts. At higher calcination temperatures, i-C6 selectivity increases but selectivities for C,-CS, MCP and benzene drop, O.B.

Isomerization is the main reaction in all cases on HY-supported catalysts. This high selectivity for n-hexane isomerization on HY-supported catalysts is a good characteristic of reforming catalysts for production of high-octane value reformate containing less aromatic compounds. Table 3 shows the Cl/C3 mole ratio of the products. The CI/C3 ratio increases with calcination temperature as shown in Table 2. The increase of the Ct/C3 ratio with reaction time, which is not observed on alumina-supported catalysts, may be due to the intensive coke formation on acid sites rather than on metal sites. 3.3.

The iridium monometallic catalyst contains 0.5 wt.-% In The lower Ct/C3 ratios on HY-supported catalysts can be explained by a higher C3 formation because of the higher acidity of HY as compared with that of alumina. The C, /C3 mole ratio sharply increases with iridium loading on HY supported catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the effect of iridium metal loading on the product distribution. As the iridium loading increases, the light hydrocarbons selectivity increases and the selectivities of MCP, benzene and i-C6 decrease. The Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts containing equal amounts of platinum and iridium provide the maximal yield of benzene and C6 isomers on alumina and HY-supported catalysts, respectively. Therefore, high-octane value hydrocarbons can be obtained from the Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts containing an equal loading of platinum and iridium. This result indicates that the physicochemical characteristics of metal clusters such as surface metal fraction and reactivity depend on the variation of the iridium loading and a more desirable Pt-Ir bimetallic cluster for high-octane reformate is formed when equal amounts of platinum and iridium are loaded. O.B. Yang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 229-241 3.4. Effect of reaction temperature 239 Fig. 7 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the product distribution and activities of Pt Ir bimetallic catalysts calcined at 673 K. On alumina-supported catalysts, the activity and benzene selectivity increase with temperature; however, i-C6 and light hydrocarbons selectivities decrease. In general, hydrocracking and isomerization of alkanes are exothermic and dehydrocyclization is endothermic on alumina-supported reforming catalysts. Our Pt(0.5)Ir(0.5)/AIZ03 catalyst also exhibits the typical heat effect on a reforming reaction. However, the reforming activity of Pt(0.5)lr(0.5) MY shows a maximum at 673 K. The i-C6 selectivity is maximal and the selectivities to cracking and benzene are minimal at 673 K. This product distribution can be attributed to the fact that isomerization and cracking are competitive reactions and the cracking reaction prevails at high temperature. The decrease of activity at temperatures higher than 673 K may be due to the sintering of metal clusters, as shown in Table 1, or to rapid coking at high temper- tO 50 ~ 50 a 204 s A l 573 623 673 723 773 Reaction Ternperaturo ('K ) Fig. 7.

Another possibility is the drop in isomerization activity which is the main reaction on the HY-supported catalysts. Tung and Mcininch [ 18 ] reported that in hexane cracking and isomerization on a CaY catalyst, the cracking activity increased steadily and isomerization exhibited a maximum at 623 K in the range of 573 K823 K. 4. Conclusions lr(0.5)/A1203 and lr(0.5)/HY catalysts undergo severe oxidative agglomeration and a reduction in metal dispersion when the calcination temperature is raised from 523 K to 773 K, whereas Pt(0.5) /A1203 and Pt(0.5) /HY exhibit relatively minor reductions in metal dispersion. The bimetallic catalysts, Pt(0.5)lr(0.5) / A1203 and Pt(0.5)lr(0.5) MY are not subjected to severe oxidative agglomeration and their activity and selectivity in n-hexane reforming are different from those of platinum and iridium monometallic catalysts. HY-zeolite-supported catalysts give higher yields for isomers and lower yields for light hydrocarbons, C,-C5, and benzene than the alumina-supported catalysts, which is a good characteristic of reforming catalysts for production of high-octane value reformate containing less aromatic compounds. Although the HY-zeolite-supported catalysts give a higher initial activity they also suffer from more severe deactivation than alumina-supported catalysts. Pt-Ir catalysts supported on A1203 and HY had a high selectivity and activity to high-octane value hydrocarbons when both metals were present in equal amounts, 0.5 wt.-% of each. The total activities of Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina and HY are closely related to those of dehydrocyclization and isomerization, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference of the nature of the support greatly influences the activity and selectivity for hexane reforming.

The characteristics and activity, selectivity and stability of Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and HY-zeolite were examined using hydrogen chemisorption on catalysts calcined at different temperatures as well as by catalyst performance for n-hexane reforming at 573–773 K and atmospheric pressure. All the catalysts used in this study were prepared by impregnation. The Pt-Ir/ HY and Pt-Ir/ Al2O3 calcined at 773 K did not exhibit severe oxidative agglomeration, in contrast to monometallic iridium catalysts, and their activity and selectivity in n-hexane reforming were quite different from those of monometallic platinum or iridium catalysts. The catalysts supported on HY-zeolite showed high activity for isomerization while γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts had high activity for dehydrocyclization. Deactivation with reaction time was much more pronounced on HY-zeolite-supported catalysts. Pt-Ir catalysts supported on Al2O3 and HY showed high selectivity and activity to high-octane value hydrocarbons when the both metals were present in equal amount, 0.5 wt.-%. Especially the HY-zeolite-supported Pt-Ir bimetallic catalyst showed a good performance for producing high-octane hydrocarbons containing less amounts of aromatic compounds. It may be concluded that the nature of the support greatly affected the catalytic properties of Pt-Ir bimetallic catalysts for n-hexane reforming.
