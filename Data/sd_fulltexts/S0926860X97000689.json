III. The influence of the nature of the solvent J. Masson, P. Cividino, J. Court* Universite Joseph Fourier, CNRS-UMR 5616, BP 53 X, 38041 Grenoble C~dex 9, France Received 10 October 1996; received in revised form 14 February 1997: accepted 14 February 1997 Abstract The influence of the nature of the solvent on the activity and selectivity of the hydrogenation of acetophenone to l- phenylethanol over Raney nickel catalysts has been studied. In the solvent sequence: cyclohexane, 2-propanol, 2-propanol- water, 2-propanol-waterodium hydroxide, the maximum yield in phenylethanol observed over Raney nickel rises from 82,4% to 99.5%. The very high selectivity in 1-phenylethanol observed in the later solvent is attributed to the presence of water at the catalyst surface which diminishes strongly the adsorption at the aromatic ring of acetophenone and of l- phenylethanol; the formation of cyclohexylmethylketone and of 1-cyclohexylethanol arising from the hydrogenation of this ring being diminished too. The addition of sodium hydroxide improves also the selectivity, the acid catalysed hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond is prevented. In the best solvent mixture, i.e., 2-propanol-water+sodiurn hydroxide, the unpromoted Raney nickel is as selective as the chromium doped catalysts, the later ones being slightly more reactive.

Introduction Acetophenone is converted to l-phenylethanol by catalytic hydrogenation over Raney nickel [1-3]. However the aromatic unsaturated ring can also be reduced, therefore the hydrogenation of acetophenone involves a sequence of several competitive parallel and consecutive reactions. In order to prepare selec- tively 1-phenylethanol it is necessary to optimise reaction conditions, e.g., method of catalyst prepara- tion, addition of promoters, solvent nature. We have shown previously that the yield in l-phenylethanol over Raney nickel can be improved by adding chro- mium to the Ni-A1 starting alloy or by soaking the catalyst in an aqueous chromium chloride solution [4]. However this improvement is the result of several factors, of which some may act to oppose each other. Thus we used the reactivity ratios given in [5] as selectivity criteria.t It appears that in the presence of Cr3+, the hydrogenation of the C=O bond is favoured over aromatic ring hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond. *Corresponding author.

In order to determine the solvent effect for each reaction step, we have computed reactivity ratios as previously described [4]. The solvents studied were: cyclo- hexane, 2-propanol, 2-propanol/water (80:20) and a 2-propanol/water (80:20) solution of sodium hydro- xide (7-10-4 mol l-i).

Reaction conditions 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation 2.1.1. Ni and NiCrl.5 The precursor alloys: Ni4oA16o and Ni38.sCrt.5A14o were prepared in an induction furnace. The alloys were crushed, screened (d<40 ~tm), and treated twice with a sodium hydroxide solution (6 M) and reflux for 2 h, according to a previously described procedure [6]. The catalysts were kept under a molar solution of sodium hydroxide. 2.1.2. Raney nickel soaked in CrCI3 : NiCr) Raney nickel, Ni, prepared from Ni4oA16o was soaked in an aqueous chromium chloride solution: 110 ml of the chloride solution (0.033 mol 1-t) were added to Ni (5 g) which had been washed with dis- tilled water prior to use. The suspension was stirred for 90 min, the catalyst was then decanted off and washed with distilled water (4x60 ml). After washing, the catalyst was kept under a molar solution of sodium hydroxide. 2.2. Catalyst characterisation The bulk composition of each catalyst was deter- mined by chemical analysis after dissolution in con- centrated nitric acid and expressed in atomic ratio. The nickel metallic surface area was measured by reactive adsorption of 3-methylthiophene in the liquid phase according to an already published protocol [6]. The results are given in Table 1. Hydrogenation was carried out in a 250 ml static reactor at constant hydrogen pressure (0.9 MPa) and temperature (353K), with a stirring speed of 1800 rpm. Due to the possible influence of sodium hydroxide on the reaction behaviour and since the catalysts are kept under a molar solution of this base, a special care must be taken for catalyst washing. When the reaction was carried out in 2-propanol and in 2-propanol-water mixtures, the catalyst was washed with distilled water (30ml) and with 2-propanol (30 ml). When cyclohexane was the hydrogenation solvent, the operation was followed by washings with cyclohexane (3 20 ml). Before introduction of acetophenone, the reactor containing a suspension of the catalyst (0.1- 0.2 g) in the solvent (135 ml) was purged with a flow of hydrogen followed by a pretreatment at room temperature for 1 h with stirring under a hydrogen pressure of 0.9 MPa. Temperature was then raised to 353 K and acetophenone (5 ml) was introduced. The start of the stirring was considered to be the start of the hydrogenation. The reaction kinetics was studied by gas chromato- graphy (GC) analysis of samples withdrawn from the reaction mixture. The conditions for the GC measure- ments were as follows: a packed colunm (4 m 1/8 in) with OV210 10%+XE 60 5% on chromosorb WHP 80/100 under a temperature of 383 K. Dodecane was used as internal standard. 2.4. Starting materials Acetophenone (99%) was distilled twice before use. The cyclohexane solvent was treated with Raney Z Masson et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 191-197 193 COCH3 A klbAf CHOHCH3 B COCH3 k3 bB k4bo D CH2CH3 C CHOHCH3 E Fig. 1. Reaction scheme. nickel in order to trap possible sulphur impurities and distilled before use. 2-propanol (HPLC grade, Aldrich) was used as received. 3. Results As shown in Fig. 1, the hydrogenation of the car- bon-oxygen double bond of acetophenone (A) gives 1-phenylethanol (B), the hydrogenation of the aro- matic ring gives cyclohexylmethylketone (D) and both compounds undergo further hydrogenation to 1-cyclo- hexylethanol (E), whereas hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond affords ethylbenzene (C). 3. I. Product compositions and initial rates The concentrations of the organic components, measured by (GLC) analysis of samples withdrawn from the reaction mixture at regular time intervals, allowed the determination of the product distribution versus acetophenone conversion. The product compo- sitions for the extent of reaction corresponding to the maximum yield in 1-phenylethanol and the initial rate constants taking into the account the nickel surface area of the catalysts are given in Table 2. It is important to note that in the solvent 2-propanol/water+sodium hydroxide (solvent 4), the hydrogenation over the Ni catalyst and over the two chromium promoted catalysts affords a very high yield in 1-phenylethanol and the same product composition especially the amount of unreacted acetophenone. The tremendous influence of the nature of the solvent is illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the curves 1 and 4 give the yield in 1-phenylethanol over Ni as a function of the acetophenone conversion in cyclohexane (sol- vent 1) and in solvent 4, respectively. It is important to note that the catalytic system Ni in solvent 4 approaches the ideal one. The curves C, D and E (Fig. 2(b)) give the yield of ethylbenzene, cyclo- hexylmethylketone and 1-cyclohexylethanol as a function of the acetophenone conversion in cyclo- chexane. The corresponding curves in the solvent 4 are not given since the amount of the main secondary product, i.e., 1-cyclohexylethanol remains always below 0.2% of the initial amount of acetophenone. The initial rate constants given in Table 2 take into account the nickel surface area (Table 1) of the cat- alysts. The activity depends strongly on the solvent, over Ni, i.e., the rate in 2-propanol is double than that observed in cyclohexane and furthermore the addition of water (20%) increases the rate by a factor of 3. The addition of sodium hydroxide to the mixture 2-pro- panol-water decreases the rate from 40.3 to 27.6. The addition of cesium hydroxide has a more pronounced effect since for the same concentration i.e., 7x10 4moll-I the rate is only 19.6, furthermore a tenfold increase in the concentration of cesium hydroxide half the rate. 194 J.

Reversibility of the hydrogenation of acetophenone Acetophenone never disappears totally from the reaction mixture as shown in Table 3 for a run over Ni, in cyclohexane. It is important to note that during the last half hour the percentage of acetophenone remained the same 0.6% whereas 15 min only were necessary to go from 4.3% down to 1%. A study by Table 3 Percentage of acetophenone left as a function of the reaction time (reaction performed on Ni in cyclohexane) Time (min) 85 90 95 100 110 140 Acetophenone (%) 4.3 2.1 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.6 mass spectroscopy confirmed that the small peak observed in the GC spectrum of the hydrogenation products arised from acetophenone.

Thus in the reaction conditions used, the hydrogenation of acetophenone into 1-phenylethanol is reversible. 4. Discussion 4.1. Selectivity and reactivity ratio The yield in 1-phenylethanol is often used as a measure of the selectivity of the catalyst. However this yield is the result of several effects, with some of which perhaps act in opposition. In order to shed light on the effect of the solvent, we computed as described previously [4,5].

The two equilibrium con- stants ba and bAt [8] result from the assumption that the chemisorption of acetophenone occurs by two different ways, some acetophenone molecules are adsorbed at the benzene ring and some at the carbonyl group. In cyclohexane, over Ni the C=O bond is nine times more reactive than the aromatic ring, over NiCrl 5 it is 15 times more reactive, and over NiCr~sl 29 times more. Thus the hydrogenation of the C=O bond is favoured by the presence of Cr3+ at the catalyst sur- face. This beneficial effect of chromium disappears totally in the solvent, 2-propanol-water (20 vol%), (solvent 3), as shown by the reactivity ratios over the three catalysts which are not significantly differ- ent2; by adding water to 2-propanol, the reactivity ratios are multiplied by a factor of at least 13, thus the high selectivity results from the presence of water. In our opinion, the dissociative adsorption of water [9] does not differentiate the three solvents since the catalysts have been prepared in aqueous solution and the washings of the catalysts with solvents cannot remove water chemisorbed in such a way. According to the large amount of the water used, the coverage of the catalyst surface is large thus the water molecule is fixed to the surface by oxygen bonding [9]. The adsorption of 2-propanol being negligible over Raney nickel [10], perhaps the ring adsorption is inhibited by the dielectric dipole in the water layer adsorbed to the metallic surface while carbonyl adsorption is favoured. The addition of sodium hydroxide to this solvent has no influence on the selectivity of these competitive reactions. Consecutive reaction : acetophenone klbA k~bB --+ 1-phenylethanol :-4 ethylbenzene For the consecutive reactions the maximum yield in 1-phenylethanol Bmax depends on the reactivity ratio 13=k3bB/klbA in such a way than an inverse relation- ship exists between /3 and Bmax. In other words a 2The specific selectivity of these two competitive reactions can be calculated using the computed reactivity ratio according to the equation: S=[klbA/k2bz']/[l+klbA/k2baI] thus one gets: 99.67; 99.69; 99.79. 196 J. Masson et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 191-197 favourable ratio B/A will be obtained if A reacts more rapidly and/or adsorbs more strongly than B. In the solvent sequence: 2-propanol, 2-propanol- water, 2-propanol-water+sodium hydroxide, the reactivity ratios k3bB/kabA decreases monotonically, over Ni it goes from 3x10-2 down to 3x10-4. In addition to the increase of the term k~bA as evidenced by the selectivity of the first step, we attribute this observation to a decrease of the equilibrium adsorp- tion constant bB. Kieboom has pointed out [11] that hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond is favoured when the C-OH is situated in the neighbourhood of an unsaturated function such as an aryl group: the ben- zene ring serves as a handle that brings the C-OH bond closer to the catalytic surface. Thus in the solvent 3, the presence of chemisorbed water which decreases bA' (the adsorption of acetophenone at the benzene ring) has of course the same effect on the adsorption of 1-phenylethanol at the benzene ring, it decreases bB. The large decrease of the adsorption at the aromatic ring in 1-phenylethanol resulting from the presence of water must have the same effect on the hydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol into 1-cyclohexylethanol. This point is confirmed by the reactivity ratio k5bB/klbA on which the yield in 1-phenylethanol depends in the consecutive reactions: klbA acetophenone ~ 1-phenylethanol ksb~8 1-cyclohexylethanol Going from 2-propanol to 2-propanol-water this ratio falls down by a factor of 100 (50-3 to 4.2x 10-5) whereas it is equal to 5.9x 10-3 in cyclo- hexane. Proton catalysis is essential for hydrogenolysis of 1-phenylethanol over carbon supported catalysts [12] a better leaving group is formed in acidic medium, i.e., -O+ H2 instead of-OH. Accordingly, the presence of a base in the solvent 4 decreases hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond. 4.2. Initial rates We attribute the rate decrease observed by addition of sodium hydroxide to the adsorption of the Na+ cation at the catalyst surface. To sustain this assertion we substituted cesium hydroxide for sodium hydro- xide: over Ni the initial rate decreases from 27.6 to 19.6. The fact that the atomic radius of Cs+ is double as that of Na+, and cesium hydroxide is as a strong base as sodium hydroxide, supports the theory that the rate decrease is due to the adsorption of the cation at the catalyst surface. 5. Conclusions Our results emphasised the primordial role of the solvent in the heterogeneous catalysed hydrogenation of acetophenone. Using 2-propanol-water (20 vol%)+sodium hydroxide (710-4 mol 1-l) as solvent, 1-phenylethanol can be obtained with a very high selectivity (99.5%) at a very high conversion of acetophenone (99.8%) over unpromoted Raney nickel. The beneficial effect of water is attributed to its undissociative chemisorption at the surface of the catalyst which inhibits the adsorption at the benzene ring of acetophenone as well as that of 1-phenyletha- nol. Accordingly the formation of 1-cyclohexyl- methylketone and that of 1-cyclohexylethanol is largely reduced. In our opinion, the basic properties of sodium hydroxide decrease the hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond in 1-phenylethanol which is acid catalysed. In the reaction conditions we used the hydrogenation of acetophenone into 1-phenylethanol is a reversible reaction, a 99.8% conversion is the limit which could be reached at this hydrogen pressure. It appeared that in the best solvent mixture unpromoted nickel is as selective as the chromium doped catalysts. In this solvent, the initial rate over Ni is smaller than that over NiCr~Ls) but is larger than that over NiCr(s); the slight activity advantage of NiCr(15) does not balance its metallurgical cost. The addition of water to 2-propanol, which results in the almost exclusive hydrogenation of the C=O bond, has also a large beneficial effect on the initial reaction rate. Thus this increase of the rate is attributed to the water layer adsorbed to the metallic surface. References [1] M. Kajitani, N. Suzuki, T. Abe, Y. Kaneko, K. Kasuya, K. Takahashi, A. Sugimori, Bull.

The very high selectivity in 1-phenylethanol observed in the later solvent is attributed to the presence of water at the catalyst surface which diminishes strongly the adsorption at the aromatic ring of acetophenone and of 1-phenylethanol; the formation of cyclohexylmethylketone and of 1-cyclohexylethanol arising from the hydrogenation of this ring being diminished too. The addition of sodium hydroxide improves also the selectivity, the acid catalysed hydrogenolysis of the COH bond is prevented. In the best solvent mixture, i.e., 2-propanol-water+sodium hydroxide, the unpromoted Raney nickel is as selective as the chromium doped catalysts, the later ones being slightly more reactive.
