DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60234-3 Influence of Ultrasound Impregnation on the Performance of Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalyst during Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis ZHOU Xiaofeng 1, *, CHEN Qingling 2 , TAO Yuewu 2 , WENG Huixin 1 1 Research Center of Petroleum Processing, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China 2 Shanghai Research Institute of Petrochemical Technology, SINOPEC, Shanghai 201208, China Abstract: A Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was prepared under an ultrasound environment. The influence of different ultrasonic powers on catalyst performance was studied. The catalysts were characterized by N 2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 tem- perature-programmed desorption, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that ul- trasound assisted in increasing the BET surface area of the catalysts and the even the dispersion of small cobalt crystallites on the support. When higher power ultrasound was used these characteristics of the catalyst changed remarkably. The pH of the Co(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution decreased with an increase in high power ultrasound treatment time, which led to a weak interaction between the smaller cobalt particles and the silica support. In addition, less cobalt silicate was formed on the catalyst. Under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst activity and stability were superior to that of the other catalysts because of higher dispersion and reduction. For example, the initial conversion of CO was 95.5% at 493 K, 2 MPa, H 2 /CO = 2.0, and GHSV = 1000 h 1 , and it was 90.9% after 48 h. Key words: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; ultrasound impregnation; vacuum; cobalt; zirconium; silica With the depletion of crude oil resources and the gradual increase in consumption, many countries are turning to alter- native fuels to ensure their energy security. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is one of the most promising ways to convert syngas derived from coal or natural gas into light olefins, gasoline, and diesel. This technology can reduce the depend- ency on petroleum to a certain extent. Iron- and cobalt-based catalysts have been successfully applied in Sasolâ€™s and Shellâ€™s commercial plants. Because of the low activity of the water gas shift reaction and the main product being long chain paraffins, cobalt catalysts are promising for the synthesis of heavy hy- drocarbons [1â€“3]. Recently, a large number of domestic achievements have been reported in the development and industrial processing of cobalt-based catalysts such as the cobalt catalyst developed by DICP (Dalian Institute of Chemical Physical, Chinese Acad- emy of Sciences (CAS)), which was used in a pilot project (3000 t/a) in 2007. Their results indicated that the catalyst could run continuously and stably for 5000 h (important achievements in science and technology and advanced special disciplines for DICP 60 years. 2009-02). The two other cobalt catalysts that have been developed by the ICC [4,5] (Institute of Coal Chemistry, CAS) and the RIPP [6] (Research Institute of Petroleum Processing, China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC)) have undergone a long period of experimental evaluation up to 2010. Now, two pilot projects wherein these catalysts are to be used are also in process. Cobalt catalysts that are supported on silica are mainly prepared by impregnation under normal temperature and pressure conditions. Zirconium promotion has been widely used in silica supported catalysts, and this results in higher FTS reaction rates and an increase in C 5+ selectivity. This promotion can prevent the interaction between cobalt particles and the support and thus the formation of hardly reducible cobalt sili- cates [3]. However, Co 3 O 4 crystallites tend to agglomerate on the support during catalyst drying or calcination and, therefore, the degree of dispersion of the metallic cobalt will decrease. The size and distribution of the cobalt crystallites on the sup- port influence the catalytic activity and stability [7â€“9]. There- fore, research is currently focused on improving the degree of dispersion of the active sites on the Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalyst sur- face. ZHOU Xiaofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1156â€“1165 During incipient wetness impregnation, the support and the impregnation solution are all exposed to an ultrasonic envi- ronment. Cavitation bubbles can be formed in solution and they are released under this extreme high temperature and high pressure environment. Active components are loaded onto the support when these bubbles collapse [10]. In addition, ultra- sonic oscillation facilitates an even distribution of the active components [11,12]. In contrast to the catalysts prepared by normal impregnation, it has been reported [13â€“15] that in an ultrasonic environment the sizes of the active metals were smaller and the metal particles were more evenly dispersed on È–-Al 2 O 3 surfaces. This results in an improvement in the activity and stability of the catalysts. In addition, Pirola et al. [16] and Bianchi et al. [17] respectively loaded metallic iron and cobalt onto silica supports in an ultrasonic environment. They con- cluded that the catalysts gave a high degree of dispersion and high conversion of carbon monoxide. General speaking, the cavitation and intensity of ultrasound with a certain frequency are enhanced with an increase in ultrasonic power [10]. With an increase in impregnation pres- sure air tends to dissolve into the impregnation solution caus- ing the cavitation threshold to drop. On the other hand, with a collapse of cavitation bubbles an increase in the gaseous components in solution will decrease the intensity of the blast wave [10,18]. According to the principle of ultrasound-vacuum cleaning [19], if the support and the impregnation solution are vacuum-treated in degassing units the impregnation process in an ultrasonic environment can be intensified. Currently, few reports exist about the preparation of cobalt catalysts in an ultrasound-vacuum environment. This study is expected to improve the dispersion of metallic cobalt on silica surfaces using this method. In this paper, we focused on the preparation of a Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalyst using the ultra- sound-vacuum method and we investigated the effects of dif- ferent ultrasonic power on catalyst morphology, the size of cobalt particles, the degree of dispersion/reduction, and the catalytic activity toward the FTS. In addition, N 2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H 2 temperature-programmed desorption (H 2 -TPD), and H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) were used to characterize the catalysts. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalysts The silica support (Sino-pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) was put into an ultrasonic generator (Branson Ultrasonics Corp, ultrasonic frequency 42 kHz, effective power 180 and 210 W). By incipient wetness impregnation, a 5% Zr(NO 3 ) 4 (AR, Sino-pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) aqueous solu- tion was dripped onto the support at â€“0.1 MPa. The ultrasonic generator was switched on and its power was regulated at 210 W (or 180 W). The sample was treated under these ultra- sonic-vacuum conditions for 1 h. After the catalyst precursor was dried at 383 K for 12 h it was impregnated with a 20% Co(NO 3 ) 2 (AR, Sino-pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) aqueous solution at â€“0.1 MPa and was then treated by ultra- sound at 210 W (or 180 W) for 1 h. The catalyst was dried at 383 K for 12 h and calcined at 673 K for 6 h. Catalyst particles of 60â€“80 mesh were evaluated for the FTS reaction after they were crushed, and sieved. The catalysts that were prepared by the above procedures are denoted 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) and 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (L), where H and L refer to higher and lower ultrasound power. In addition, the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (V) catalyst was also prepared using the above procedures but without ultrasonic treatment. The 20% Co(NO 3 ) 2 and 5% Zr(NO 3 ) 4 aqueous solutions were simultaneously put into the ultrasonic generator. We determined the change in solution pH with a change in ultra- sonic power and treatment time. A pH meter (Model: PHSJ-3F, resolution: 0.01, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd) was used to measure the pH of the solution. Before the pH meter was used, it was calibrated using two buffer solutions with pH values of 4.0 and 7.0. 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts The BET surface area, pore size distribution and pore vol- ume were measured by N 2 physisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. XRD measurements were carried out using the Cu K Ä® radiation of a Bruker D8-ADVANCE powder diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA and 4Âº/min). The H 2 -TPR ex- periment was carried out using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920. 50 mg samples were used for programmed-reduction in a 10% H 2 â€“90% Ar mixed gas at a rate of 10 K/min from ambient temperature to 1073 K. The H 2 -TPD experiment was per- formed using a self-made device. Before the experiment, the 50 mg samples were reduced using high purity H 2 at 673 K for 5 h. After they were cooled to room temperature, high purity N 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml/min was passed over the catalysts for 1 h. The temperature was then increased from ambient temperature to 1073 K at 10 K/min. The TEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai 20 S-TWIN instrument. 1.3 Activity test for the FTS The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (Ä³ 8 mm). The catalyst was reduced in situ with H 2 at 673 K and under atmospheric pressure for 12 h. After reduc- tion, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. Syngas was introduced to the reactor and the pressure was gradually in- creased to the set value. Meanwhile, the reactor temperature was increased to the set value at 2 K/min. When the steady state was reached after an initial reaction of 12 h we calculated the carbon monoxide conversion and the selectivity of products ZHOU Xiaofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1156â€“1165 under the different reaction conditions. The effluent gas was passed through an Agilent 6890(N) GC for online analysis. Liquid product analysis was performed using an Agilent 6820 GC equipped with an FID detector. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structural properties of the catalysts The textural properties and cobalt particle size of the dif- ferent Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalysts are showed in Table 1. The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the silica support decreases sharply with component load. How- ever, when the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst was treated with higher power ultrasound its BET surface area was found to be relatively larger. This result is consistent with that reported previously [13â€“16]. In addition, no zirconium phase was detected in the XRD patterns of the three fresh catalysts (not shown here), which indicates that zirconia is highly dispersed on the silica support [7]. According to literature [20â€“22], the average diameter of the Co 3 O 4 crystallites can be calculated using the Scherrer equation from the most intense Co 3 O 4 peak at 2È™ = 36.9Â°. The size of metallic cobalt and the degree of dispersion were de- termined using the formulae: d = 0.75 u d(Co 3 O 4 ) and D (%) = 96/d. The calculated results are shown in Table 1. The size of metallic cobalt in the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst is at a minimum and, on the contrary, its degree of dispersion is at a maximum. TEM was conducted to study the surface morphology of the three calcined catalysts. As Fig. 1 shows, it is obvious that the cobalt particles of 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (V) are cluttered. How- ever, the cobalt particles of 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) are more uniform and nebulous, which implies that the cobalt particles are smaller and are highly dispersed on the support. This phenomenon is similar to that obtained by Liang et al. [13] who reported that LaCoO 3 was evenly distributed on a È–-Al 2 O 3 support in an ultrasonic environment. The impregnation solu- tion can create cavitation bubbles in the ultrasonic environment at â€“0.1 MPa. As Fig. 1(d) shows, the surface of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst shows that many cavity traces were eroded by the cavitation bubbles. 2.2 Solution pH in an ultrasonic environment The pH of the impregnation solution can change when the solution is put into an ultrasound environment at extremely high temperature and high pressure. Table 2 shows the pH values of the 20% Co(NO 3 ) 2 and the 5% Zr(NO 3 ) 4 aqueous solutions upon changing the ultrasonic power and the treatment time. The pH values of the two solutions decrease dramatically in the higher power ultrasonic environment. Furthermore, when a 20% Co(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution is treated with higher power ultrasound for 1 h, pink Co(OH) 2 precipitation occurs.

The Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions react with OH â€¢ and precipitation occurs, which leads to the pH of the im- pregnation solution decreasing (Co(H 2 O) 6 3+ ions cannot exist in the aqueous solution because of their high oxidation state [23]). However, lower-intensity ultrasound decreases the pH of the solution slightly. Chen et al. [24] reported that Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions can interact with silanol groups on the surface of silica during the im- pregnation process. Silica is an amphoteric material and the different kinds of silanol groups depend on the pH of the im- pregnated solution and they exist as Siâ€“OH, SiO , or SiOH 2 + . Van Steen et al. [25] reported that the interaction between Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions and silanol groups becomes stronger as the pH increases in the impregnation solution; in addition, water ligands were necessary for the formation of a surface cobalt silicate. It has also been reported that the pH of an impregna- tion solution affects the Co-silica interaction [26â€“28]. When the pH is less than the isoelectric point of silica (2.0â€“3.5 [29]), a surplus of positive charge is present on the surface of the silica. Because of an electrostatic interaction the direct ad- sorption of negative nitrate ions takes place and the Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions are in indirect contact with the silanol groups, which helps to weaken the Co-silica interaction, inhibit formation of cobalt silicates, and improve the degree of reduction of the catalyst. Higher power ultrasound can decrease the pH of the impreg- nation solution. Theoretically, it will help weaken the Co-silica interaction and finally inhibit the formation of cobalt silicates. Of course, this hypothesis should be validated by other char- acterization techniques. 2.3 Result of H 2 -TPD The H 2 -TPD profiles of the different Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. According to literature [30], the hydrogen desorption peak at low temperature (about 463 K) is due to hydrogen spillover from metallic cobalt to the support. The other desorption peaks at medium (about 603 K) and high temperature (about 703 K) respectively relate to hydrogen desorption over the metallic cobalt on zirconia and the silica surface. From Fig. 2, when the Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalysts are treated with ultrasound the peaks at about 463 K move to the low temperature direction and hydrogen adsorption decreases. Higher power ultrasound causes the hydrogen desorption peak on the silica surface to move to the low temperature direction and causes the amount of hydrogen adsorption on the zirconia and silica surfaces to increase (content of hydrogen adsorption is calculated on the basis of the H 2 -TPD integrated area from 489 to 803 K. 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) > 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (L) > 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (V)). The strong-metal-support-interaction (SMSI), as Tauster et al. [31] explained, is produced by the electron transfer from the reduced oxide support to the metal particle. Therefore, hydro- gen chemisorption on the metal is essentially reduced. Ishihara et al. [32] reported that when metallic ruthenium was loaded onto a silica support the catalyst showed higher catalytic ac- tivity for the FTS. Further research indicated that an electron is transferred from the metal particle to the support, which de- creases the electron density of metallic ruthenium. The corre- sponding hydrogen desorption peak (characterized by H 2 -TPD) moves to the low temperature direction. As for the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst, the hydrogen desorption peak at about 703 K that moves to the low temperature direction can be explained in terms of electron transfer from metallic cobalt to the silica support and a decrease in electron density of the metallic cobalt. Therefore, the Co-silica interaction will be weakened and the amount of hydrogen that adsorbs on the support will increase. Additionally, a larger amount of small cobalt crystallites are present on the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst and hydrogen can be adsorbed, dissociated, and transferred to the catalystâ€™s surface at lower temperature (about 450 K). This also facilitates the adsorption of hydrogen which further promotes the FTS. Considering the peak at about 603 K, ultrasound slightly influenced hydrogen adsorption over metallic cobalt on the surface of zirconia, which is perhaps related to the low content of zirconia in these catalysts. 2.4 Results of H 2 -TPR The H 2 -TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 3 for the different Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalysts. Generally speaking, the reduction proc- ess of the cobalt catalyst that was supported on silica is divided into two steps: Co 3 O 4 (with trivalent cobalt oxides and bivalent cobalt oxides) Äº CoO Äº Co 0 . Moreover, from 703â€“1003 K there is a hidden reduction of the barely reducible cobalt sili- cate [2,25]. As Fig. 3(a) shows, the Co 3 O 4 reduction peak of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst becomes inconspicuous, which is due to the less trivalent and more bivalent cobalt oxides 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 (4) (3) (2) Temperature (K) (1) I n t e n s i t y 694 592 640 595 700 446 593 462 Fig. 2.

ZHOU Xiaofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1156â€“1165 being present in the Co 3 O 4 crystallites. In addition, the figure also implies that a single phase of bivalent cobalt oxides is present because the CoO reduction peak is sharper [26]. The reductive behavior of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst that was prepared in the higher-power ultrasonic environment might be relevant to Co(OH) 2 precipitation. In addition, the cobalt silicate reduction peak of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst becomes more inconspicuous, which means that higher power ultrasound can weaken the interaction between the cobalt crystallites and the silica support to form less cobalt silicate. By combining the results of H 2 -TPD and H 2 -TPR, we con- clude that higher power ultrasound can weaken the Co-silica interaction, enhance the degree of cobalt particle reduction (see Table 1) and increase the content of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst. However, since the pH of the impregnation solution in the lower power ultrasonic environment changes slightly, the Co-silica interaction and the cobalt silicates still exist. 2.5 Catalytic activity toward the FTS The performance of the three Co/Zr/SiO 2 catalysts at dif- ferent temperatures and with other reaction conditions of 2 MPa, H 2 /CO = 2.0 and GHSV = 1000 h â€“1 is listed in Table 3. Iglesia [1] reported that if the size of the metallic cobalt was more than 6 nm, the FTS was a reaction of structure insensi- tivity. Moreover, it has been found that higher volumetric cobalt site densities on the catalyst leads to a higher FTS reac- tion rate and better selectivity for C 5+ products. The higher power ultrasound is conducive to the dispersion of smaller cobalt particles on the support and it also leads to a decrease in the pH of the Co(NO 3 ) 2 impregnation solution. When the pH is less than the isoelectric point of silica, a surplus of positive charge is present on the silica surface. Because of the electro- static interaction, nitrate ions are directly adsorbed on the support and the Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions are in indirect contact with the silanol groups, which helps to weaken the Co-silica interaction and inhibit the formation of cobalt silicates as well as improve both the degree of reduction and the active sites in the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst. In addition, from the result of H 2 -TPD, hydrogen can be adsorbed, dissociated, and transferred to the 20%Co/ 5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst surface at lower temperature, which also facilitates the FTS. Therefore, under the same reaction conditions the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst has the highest catalytic activity and selectivity for C 5+ . After a reaction over 48 h and at 493 K, the three catalysts were deactivated to a different extent. In contrast, the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst is more stable, which is consistent with Bianchi et al. [17] who reported on the stability of the Co/SiO 2 catalyst that was treated by ultrasound. 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (V) 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) 594 597 575 (a) 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (L) 500 550 600 650 700 Temperature (K) 601 I n t e n s i t y (b) I n t e n s i t y 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (V) 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (L) 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 Temperature (K) Fig. 3.

ZHOU Xiaofeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1156â€“1165 There are many reasons for the deactivation of cobalt-based catalysts. Dalai et al. [33] postulated that cobalt silicate for- mation was one reason because of the increase in water concentration with time-on-stream (TOS) in the FTS. Higher power ultrasound can change the catalyst morphology, weaken the Co-silica interaction and inhibit the formation of cobalt silicates. These factors may assist in improving the stability of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst. 3 Conclusions During incipient wetness impregnation, a Co/Zr/SiO 2 cata- lyst for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was prepared in a 42 kHz ultrasonic environment. The cavitation that was created by ultrasound with higher power (210 W) or lower power (180 W) increased the BET surface area of the catalyst and evenly dis- tributed the smaller cobalt crystallites over the support. The textural properties and the size of the cobalt particles change obviously for the catalyst treated with higher power ultrasound. Moreover, pink Co(OH) 2 precipitation appeared in the cobalt nitrate aqueous solution and the pH of the solution decreased simultaneously with an increase in the higher power ultrasound treatment time. When the pH of the impregnation solution was less than the isoelectric point of silica, the Co(H 2 O) 6 2+ ions were in indirect contact with the silanol groups, which helped to weaken the Co-silica interaction and inhibit the formation of cobalt silicate. Under the same FTS reaction conditions, the activity and stability of the 20%Co/5%Zr/SiO 2 (H) catalyst were superior to that of the others because of its higher dis- persion and degree of reduction.

Tel: +86-21-68462197-5402; Fax: +86-21-68462283 A Co/Zr/SiO2 catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was prepared under an ultrasound environment. The influence of different ultrasonic powers on catalyst performance was studied. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, H2 temperature-programmed desorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that ultrasound assisted in increasing the BET surface area of the catalysts and the even the dispersion of small cobalt crystallites on the support. When higher power ultrasound was used these characteristics of the catalyst changed remarkably. The pH of the Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution decreased with an increase in high power ultrasound treatment time, which led to a weak interaction between the smaller cobalt particles and the silica support. In addition, less cobalt silicate was formed on the catalyst. Under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst activity and stability were superior to that of the other catalysts because of higher dispersion and reduction. For example, the initial conversion of CO was 95.5% at 493 K, 2 MPa, H2/CO = 2.0, and GHSV = 1000 h−1, and it was 90.9% after 48 h.
