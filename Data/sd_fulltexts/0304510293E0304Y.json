These catalysts gradually lose their activity due to an intrinsic deactivation mechanism. Experimental results have shown that the deactivation is due to the isomerization of the Mo-cyclobutane intermediate into a-complexes of the alkenes with the Mo'+ ions.

Introduction The remarkably high metathesis activity at room temperature of catalysts prepared by photoreduction of M003/Si02 in CO followed by chemisorption of cyclopropane, has been proven to be due to the formation of Mo=CHZ carbene complexes [ 1,21: Photoreduction: O h v, 293 K _ 11 + CO + COZ O O 0 o I I (1) I II *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the initial high activity of the catalyst diminishes gradually, as demonstrated for the metathesis of propene (Fig. 1) [ 3 ] . The loss of activity was found to be independent of the propene flow rate, indicating an intrinsic deactivation mechanism. In the case of propene metathesis intermediates like Mo-cyclobutanes and Mo=CHCH3 participate in productive metathesis (Eq. 3).

These Mo=CH-CH3 carbene complexes were found to be stable at room temperature in vacuum and their decomposition started only at elevated temperature [ 4 ] . The stability of both Mo=CHz and Mo=CH-CH3 carbene complexes might indicate that the deactivation of the catalyst during propene metathesis is rather due to isomerization of metallacyclobutane complexes (reaction 5), than of metal-carbene complexes ( reaction 4 ) . In order to prove the possibility of the isomerization of Mo-cyclobutanes into an olefin 7r-complex, and thus to support the proposed mechanism of catalyst deactivation, we studied the properties of the simplest Mo-cyclobutane complex, which can be formed by interaction of ethene with Mo=CH2/Si02 at room temperature (reaction 6a): 40 30 _O_ 20 m C O U 10 0 0 10 Process time / h y 5 wt.Y Mo03 ~ 2.5 wt.% Mo03 7 wt.% Mo43 t wt.'/.

In view of the above, it is suggested that subsequently reaction 6b takes place, giving a propene 7r-complex IX. Whenever formed, the 7r-complex can be decomposed during thermodesorption at 473 K and propene can be quantitatively detected with mass spectroscopy [ 1 ] . (It is obvious that the number of propene molecules formed after the reaction between ethene and Mo=CHZ/Si02 should be equal to the number of active carbene complexes, that had been deactivated). Due to the differences in their absorption spectra the transformations of surface species such as III, VIII and IX can be monitored with UV-Vis spectroscopy [ 2] . These two techniques were used in the following study of ethene interaction with Mo=CHZ/Si02 in a closed volume at room temperature. 2. Experimental M003/Si02 catalyst (1 wt.% Mo, 6 X 10'v atom Mo/g) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of commercial silica KSK-2-5 (specific surface area 300 m2/g), prewashed in boiling HCl and calcined in oxygen flow at 773 K, with a calculated amount of an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7Oz4. After drying in air and calcination in a stream of oxygen at 773 K the Mo03/SiOz sample (2 g) was placed in a quartz reactor connected to a vacuum system, calcined in dry oxygen (13.3 kPa) at 1073 K for 1 h and then heated under vacuum (1.33 X 10-2 Pa) for 1 h at the same temperature. The catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in vacuum and then 1.33 kPa of CO was introduced under irradiation with a high-pressure 1 kW mercury lamp supplied with a water filter. During photoreduction COZ was continuously collected in a liquid nitrogen trap (77 K). After photoreduction for 2 h the sample was outgassed at 423 K to remove any chemisorbed CO. Cyclopropane (133 Pa) was chemisorbed at 293 K, followed by desorption of ethene from co-produced 7r-complexes with Mo'+ at 473 K (reaction 2b). Bare Mo'+ ions 11 were then oxidized to Mo'+ ions with 133 Pa of oxygen at room temperature. At this point the catalyst contains only III and inactive I species. For further experiments the catalyst was divided into portions for the spectroscopic measurements (about 0.3 g) and catalysis (about 0.1-0.2 g) which were transferred under vacuum into a UV-Vis quartz cell and glass vials supplied with breakable seals. The rest of the catalyst was oxidized at 900 K in oxygen. The number of COZ molecules produced allowed to estimate the concentration of the metal-carbene complexes in the catalyst to be 3 X 10`9 Mo=CHZ/g. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV-Vis range were recorded with a Specord M-40 spectrophotometer. Pressed pellet of MgO was used as a reference. Gas-phase compositions K.A. Vikulov et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 61-67 65 and thermodesorption products of were analyzed with a UTI-100C quadruple mass spectrometer calibrated with gas mixtures of known compositions. The activity of the catalyst samples (0.1-0.2 g) for the metathesis of propene was measured at 293 K in a circulation reactor. The total reactor volume was 580 cm3, the initial propene pressure was 9.3 kPa. The gas-phase composition was analyzed with the mass spectrometer. Reaction rates were calculated from the kinetic data by applying the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, as described previously [ 5 ] . 3. Results The UV-Vis spectrum of the sample (0.3 g) of a CO-photoreduced and cyclopropanetreated catalyst containing 1 X 1Ot9 Mo=CHZ complexes is presented in Fig. 2, curve 1. The absorption band (AB) at 480 nm has been assigned to the Mo-cyclobutane complex VIII formed by reaction 6a [ 2] . After the spectrum was recorded ethene was introduced into the cell (molar ratio CZHc/Mo=CHZ = 3) at 293 K without changing the position of the cell. Fig. 2 shows the sequence of spectra recorded at equal intervals of 1 h (curves 2-6). Changes in the UV-Vis spectrum of the catalyst occurred with time, i.e. a gradual decrease of the intensity of the AB at 480 nn and an increase of a shoulder at about 580-600 nm. Taking into account that the AB at 580-600 nm is characteristic of 7r-complexes of olefins with Mo4+ ions [ 1,2], one can suggest that the observed spectral changes are caused by slow transformation of Mo-cyclobutane complexes VIII into propene 7r-complexes IX on the surface, according to reaction 6b.

Vikulov et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 61-67 in a liquid nitrogen trap, followed by thermodesorption of the surface products at 623 K (30 min). Desorbing molecules were also condensed in the same trap. After warming up to room temperature the content of the trap was analyzed with the mass spectrometer. The analysis showed the presence of propene and small quantities of butene in the cell after 6 h of contact time with ethene at room temperature (Table 1, line I). Assuming that each molecule of butene was mainly formed by metathesis of two propene molecules, one can calculate the total amount of propene produced after 6 h from ethene and Mo=CHz. According to reaction 6b this amount of propene (0.24X 10'9 molecules) should be equal to the number of Mo=CHZ complexes that had reacted. In other words, after 6 h of contact time with ethene at 293 K, 24% of the original active sites was deactivated according to reaction 6b. Next, 1.4 X 10'9 ethene molecules were introduced into the cell and it was left for another 72 h at 293 K. After 72 h a mass spectroscopic analysis of the products was performed (Table 1, line II). From the data of Table 1 one can calculate that in 72 h 0.50 X 10'9 Mo=CHZ complexes had reacted so that in 6 + 72 h in total 74% of the original Mo=CHZ complexes was deactivated. The specific catalytic activity of the sample (TOF in the metathesisof propene at 293 K) kept in ethene for 6 h and for 6 + 72 h decreased from 3.4 mol C,H6/ (Mo-atoms s) to 3.0 and 0.5 mol C316/(Mo-atoms s), respectively. These values are in good agreement with the deactivation rate of Mo=CHZ estimated above. Microcalorimetric measurements described elsewhere [ 6] showed that the 7r-complex IX turned out to be 81 40 kJ/mol more stable than the isomeric cyclobutane complex VIII (Fig. 3). It follows that the discussed isomerization is thermodynamically favourable. However, this process is likely to have a certain activation barrier required for a 2-1 hydrogen shift which makes it to proceed rather slowly at room temperature. In general, it is possible to say that any other Mo-cyclobutane complex can undergo Table 1 Interaction a of ethene with Mo=CH2: products of thermodesorption at 623 K'.

Conclusions 1. Photoreduced M003/Si02 catalysts treated with cyclopropane lose their original high activity during the metathesis of propene after several hours on stream. An intrinsic mechanism is suggested to account for the deactivation. 2. Experimental results indicate that the deactivation is due to isomerization of the Mocyclobutane intermediate into an inactive 7r-complex of the corresponding olefin with a Mo4+ ion.
