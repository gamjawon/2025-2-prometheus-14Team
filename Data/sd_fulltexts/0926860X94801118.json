Under the reaction conditions used in this work, sulfated zirconia did not contribute to carbon monoxide conversion but brought about significant changes in hydrocarbon distribution. With increasing amounts of sulfated zirconia, the yield of C3 hydrocarbons decreased while that of C4 increased; changes in the yields of C,, CZ, C5 and C6 hydrocarbons were negligible; more isoalkanes and less alkenes were formed. All these changes were attributed to secondary reactions of primary FTS products over the strongly acidic sulfated zirconia. These secondary reactions involved oligomerization-cracking, skeletal isomerization, hydrogen transfer and coking. Calcination temperature of sulfated zirconia had a strong effect on its activity for the secondary reactions. Coke deposition on sulfated zirconia was identified to be the main reason of the catalyst deactivation. The very strong Lewis acid sites are proposed to be responsible for the rapid coking deactivation. Addition of small amounts of platinum on SOa- /Zr02 or mixing SO4- /Zr02 with the FTS catalyst instead of using them in separate layers improved the overall stability of the hybrid catalyst.

Introduction The continuously increasing environmental concerns and surging demand for premium motor fuels have spurred the promulgation of more stringent environmental regulations on transportation fuels such as the 1990 Amendments to the US Clean Air Act (CAA) [ 11. Branched alkanes are valuable because they ideally fit reformulated gasoline specifications. However, it has been reported that within the limits of existing refining technology, there *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Therefore the development of technologies for producing additional amounts of branched alkanes is highly needed. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a promising approach for producing hydrocarbons from resources other than petroleum [ 3 ] . However, it suffers first from a lack of selectivity toward gasoline range products and second, from the fact that the products are mostly straight-chain hydrocarbons having poor octane numbers [ 4 ] . Manipulation of product selectivity during FTS has been the main objective of research in this field. Among the various approaches reported earlier, a group of methods involve alteration of the reaction feed by addition of alkenes [ 5,6] or trapping reagents [ 7 ] . Another type of approaches is through modification of the catalyst by combining a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst with a second component which facilitates the formation of desired products via a different surface chemistry. In the latter approach, the primary a-alkenes originating from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis undergo a number of secondary reactions on the non-FischerTropsch component of the catalyst. The nature and extent of such secondary reactions depend on the properties of the non-Fischer-Tropsch component such as its acidity or shapeselectivity [ 8-10] . For example, the formation of isoalkanes is enhanced when the strength and concentration of the support acid sites are increased. This has been illustrated in FTS studies over ruthenium loaded Y zeolites with different neutralizing cations [ 11,12]. On the other hand, sulfated zirconia (S04- /Zr02) was recently found to exhibit superacid properties [ 13 ] and to be a powerful catalyst in isomerization of linear alkanes, leading to the formation of large amounts of multibranched alkanes [ 14,15 ] . This type of material has gained importance because of its strongly acidic and non-corrosive characteristics. The main purpose of this investigation was to use hybrid catalysts consisting of a conventional FTS catalyst and sulfated Zr02 to hopefully make branched alkanes from synthesis gas in a single-step process. This communication reports the results of the first stage of this work, in which FTS experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. The decline and stabilization of catalytic activity of sulfated Zr02, the effect of its calcination temperature, and the comparison between sulfated Zr02 and some acid zeolites were also dealt with. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Zirconium hydroxide was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconyl chloride with aqueous ammonium hydroxide at ambient temperature. The precipitate was washed until no chloride ions were detected, then dried and powdered to below 100 mesh. The sulfation of the Zr(OH)4 was achieved either by pouring 15 ml of 0.5 M sulfuric acid per gram of Zr(OH)4 placed on a filter paper or by stirring 10m] of 0.5 M sulfuric acid per gram of Zr(OH)4 for 1 h and then separating the solid from the liquid by filtration. The sulfated Zr(OH)4 was then dried overnight and finally calcined at a given temperature for 3 h. Platinum-loaded 504- /Zr02 (designated as Pt/S04- /Zr02) was prepared by impregnation of H2PtCI6 on sulfated Zr(OH)4 using the incipient wetness method, followed by drying and calcination at 620 for 3 h. The platinum content was 1 wt.-%. X. Song, A. Sayari /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994) 121-136 123 The Fischer-Tropsch catalyst used in this study was 2 wt.-% Ru-loaded NaY. It was prepared by ion exchange with Ru(NH3)6C13. An aqueous solution of Ru(NH3)6C13 (0.002 M) was mixed with NaY and stirred continuously for 50 h at ambient temperature. After ion exchange, the solid was filtered, washed until no Cl- could be detected, and dried in air at 40 for 24 h. The ruthenium complex was then decomposed under a helium flow by heating at a rate of 2/min to 420. This temperature was maintained for 4-5 h before reducing the sample in flowing hydrogen for 2 h at the same temperature. HY was prepared by calcining NH4Y (Strem Chemicals) at 420 for 3 h. HM was prepared by calcining NH4M (zEOLON 100H, Norton Co.) at 520 for 3 h. The ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized according to the procedure described by Gabelica et al. [ 16] . The as-synthesized zeolite was first calcined in air for 10 h at 500, and then converted to ammonium form by successive ion exchange with 1 M ammonium nitrate solution. The HZSM-5 was obtained by air calcination of the ammonium form at 500 for 10 h. 2.2. Reaction studies FTS was carried out in a CDS-804 Micro-Pilot Plant with the capability of on-line gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. The reactor part of the system consisted of a down-flow, fixed-bed tubular micro-reactor made from a stainless-steel tube (3/8 in. O.D., 1/4 in. I.D. X 9 in. long). Product analysis was carried out using thermoconductivity (TCD) and flame ionization detectors linked in series, and a stainless-steel column (1/8 in. O.D. X 12 ft. long) packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh). All the lines and valves between the reactor and the GC injector were heated at 190. In a typical experiment, prereduced RuNaY (0.2 g) and SO4- /ZrO2 (0.05-0.3 g) were loaded in two separate layers in the reactor, with the former being upstream. They were heated under a hydrogen flow of 50 ml/min to 300, held there for 1 h, and then cooled to reaction temperature. FTS reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure and 250 using a 1:1 mixture of HZ/CO flowing at 40 ml/min. The products were analyzed after a 5-min reaction period. The hydrogen bracketing technique [ 17] which gave the catalyst a 35-min hydrogen purge after every 5 min reaction was used to maintain a clean ruthenium surface, yielding reproducible carbon monoxide conversions. Propene conversion experiments were carried out over S02- 4 - /Zr02 alone under conditions similar to those used for FTS. 0.1 g of SOQ - /Zr02 was first heated in-situ to reaction temperature (250) under a hydrogen flow of 40 ml/min. A mixture of propene (1 ml/ min) and synthesis gas (40 ml /min) was then introduced to the reactor. Products from the reactor were analyzed by on-line GC after 2 min of reaction. The hydrogen bracketing technique was also used as in the carbon monoxide hydrogenation experiments. 2.3. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and benzene Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out to determine the acid strength of the catalysts, using an AMI-1 instrument (Altamira, Inc.) equipped with a Gow-Mac TCD. Ammonia and benzene were used as adsorbates. In a typical run, 0.10-0.12 g of a calcined sample was placed in a quartz tubular reactor and heated at its calcination temperature under a helium flow of 30 ml/min for 60 min. The reactor was then 124 X. Song, A. Sayari /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994)121-136 cooled to 100 and adsorption was conducted at that temperature by exposing the sample either to an ammonia flow of 30 ml/min for 40 min or to 60 /A of benzene. Physically adsorbed species were removed by purging the sample with a helium stream flowing at 30 ml/min for 60 min at 100. The chemisorbed adsorbates were then thermally desorbed by increasing the reactor temperature to 800 at 10/min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hydrocarbon distribution The discussion that follows deals with data obtained in the presence of RuNaY and S'- /Zr02 loaded in the reactor as two separate layers. Under our experimental conditions, 04 2- 04 /Zr02 showed no activity for carbon monoxide conversion. This implies that only RuNaY was responsible for carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Constant carbon monoxide conversion (3%) was obtained after each 5-min reaction regardless of the number of hydrogen bracketing periods. However, hydrocarbon distributions were found to change from one reaction period to another. Detailed description of these changes as well as their origin will be dealt with later. In the following discussion, data from the second reaction period were considered. Hydrocarbon selectivities at constant carbon monoxide conversion (3%) in the presence of varying amounts of S04 - /Zr02 are shown in Table 1. Comparison with data obtained over RuNaY alone shows that the presence of S04 - /Zr02 downstream of RuNaY leads to significant changes in C3, C4 yields, isoalkane formation and alkene/alkane ratios. As shown in Fig. 1, with increasing amounts of S04 - /Zr02, C3 fraction decreased while C4 fraction increased. On the contrary, changes in the yields of C,, C2, CS and C6 fractions were negligible. These facts lead us to recognize that in the presence of SOQ- /Zr02, C3 hydrocarbons were partly converted into C4 hydrocarbons. From the yields of C3 (total), propane (C3 ), propene (C3) and CQ hydrocarbons listed in Table 1, it may be concluded that propene (a primary FTS product) undergoes two types of secondary reactions on Table 1 Hydrocarbon distribution in the presence of varying amounts of SOa- /ZrOZ Hydrocarbons Amounts of SO;- /Zr02 (g) (wt.-%) 0 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.30 C, 32.7 34.6 33.9 34.9 34.2 35.4 C2 11.8 12.7 11.4 12.2 12.5 11.3 C3 21.4 17.3 14.7 12.0 7.7 7.0 C3 17.7 12.7 8.7 6.6 0.8 0 C3 3.7 4.6 6.0 5.4 6.9 7.0 C4 18.9 20.6 24.1 27.1 32.5 33.9 CS 10.7 10.3 10.9 9.8 9.3 8.9 C6 4.5 4.5 5.0 4.0 3.8 3.5 recalcined at 6O for 3 h.

S04- /Zr02- One is hydrogenation via hydrogen transfer, leading to the formation of additional propane. The other is the conversion of C3 to CQ hydrocarbons. The latter reaction is important not only to explain the changes in C3 and CQ yields but also, as will be discussed later, to rationalize the greater-than-equilibrium quantity of isoalkanes. By conducting propane reaction over a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-S catalyst with low platinum content (0.4 wt.-%) and between 200 and 350, Engelen et al. [ 18 ] reported that butanes appear to be the main higher hydrocarbons formed. Since no CZ species were observed, the authors suggested that these CQ species were not formed via a methyl shift between two propane molecules. Most likely, C4 was a cracking (ss-scission) product of an oligomer of propene formed from dehydrogenation of propane on platinum sites. According to the authors, the smallest oligomer for which cracking can occur is C9. A similar multistep mechanism applied to C,2 oligomers as starting species will also lead mainly to butanes. In light of the conclusions of Engelen et al. [ 18 ] , our product distribution shown in Table 1 may be interpreted as follows. Under the reaction conditions used in this work, propene transformation to CQ hydrocarbons proceeds through an oligomerization-cracking mechanism coupled with hydrogen transfer. It is suggested that the propene formed on the ruthenium surface readsorbs on the acid sites of S04 - /Zr02 and undergoes oligomerization to heavier products (Scheme 1). The C9+ formed can be cracked to CQ and CS species. Both C4 and CS species can react again with propene to form C, and Cg hydrocarbons, respectively. The probability for a CS species to react with propene is higher than that of C4 perhaps because of preferential adsorption of heavier hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface and faster desorption of light ones, as suggested'liy Flinn et al. [ 19 ] and Wen et al. [ 15 ] . This accounts for the fact that conversely to CQ hydrocarbons no additional CS hydrocarbons were formed on SOQ- /Zr02. To verify the mechanism shown in Scheme 1, a small amount of propene ( 2.4 vol.-% ) was cofed with the synthesis gas over S04 - /Zr02 alone. It is seen from Table 2 that at 250, the major products of this reaction are saturated CQ hydrocarbons. A considerable 126 X. Song, A.

Proposed mechanism for C3 conversion to C4. amount of propane was also formed as a result of hydrogen transfer reactions. However, only a small amount of C5+ was detected. It was also observed that the C5+ yield increases with the propene concentration in the CO/HZ feed at the expense of C4 hydrocarbons. Another remarkable point concerning the data in Table 2 is the large amount of isobutane in the products. A number of studies of alkene reactions on acidic zeolites led to similar observations [ 20-23 ] . It was found that the formation of branched alkene oligomer intermediates is strongly dependent on the concentration and strength of acid sites [22]. The higher the concentration and strength of these acid sites, the more branched the alkene oligomer intermediates. Therefore a decomposition of the oligomer formed on more acidic catalysts would result in the formation of more isoalkanes. As shown in Fig. 2, branched alkanes increased with the amount of S04 - /Zr02. The C4 fraction can be comprised of as much as 91% isobutane while the isopentane content of the CS fraction (i-CS %, wt.) can reach 83%. Because of the strong relationship between the isobutane content in total C4 hydrocarbons ( i-CQ %, wt.) and the amount of superacid, this information will be used as a gauge for the isomerization ability of SOQ - /Zr02. Comparison between thermodynamic equilibrium values of i-C4 /n-C4- [24] and our experimental data is depicted in Fig. 3. As seen, in the presence of S04 - /Zr02, this ratio exceeds equilibrium values.

The formation of large amounts of isoalkanes is primarily a result of readsorption and secondary carbonium ion-type reactions of alkenes on the acid sites of S04- /Zr02. Two types of reactions are believed to contribute to the formation of isoalkanes on S04_ /Zr02One is direct skeletal isomerization of n-alkenes to isoalkenes and their subsequent hydrogenation via hydrogen transfer. The other is, as discussed earlier, the decomposition of oligomers formed on acid sites. The first reaction is known to be equilibrium-limited [ 12 ] . Considering the much greater-than-equilibrium quantity of isobutane (Fig. 3) , it is inferred that the contribution to the formation of isobutane from the decomposition of oligomers is perhaps much more important than that from direct isomerization of n-alkenes. Fig. 4 shows alkene/alkane ratios for C2-C4 hydrocarbons produced at 250 in the presence of various amounts of S04- /Zr02.

Compared to the C3 /C3 ratio, ethylene/ethane ratios were consistently much lower and less sensitive to SO2 - /Zr02 amount, whilst C4 /C4 ratios were complicated by secondary isomerization reactions. Like i-C4 %, the C3 /C3 ratio may also be considered as a measure of SOQ- /Zr02 activity for secondary alkene reactions and thus as a measure of its acidity. The decrease of the alkene-to-alkane ratio with increasing amounts of S04 2- /Zr02 may be partly explained by the enhancement of hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by the increased number of acid sites. Formation of alkanes by similar hydrogen-transfer reactions has been observed (luring propene polymerization over silica-alumina [25] and various alkene reactions on zeolites [ 20-23 ] . In hydrogen- transfer reactions, some alkene molecules are saturated with hydrogen from other alkene molecules and/or oligomers tightly bound to the catalyst surface. As a result, the hydrogen-donating oligomers become more unsatu rated. The polymerization of these highly unsaturated species results in the formation of coke precursor. As will be discussed later, such coke deposition leads eventually to the deactivation of S04 -- /Zr02. Another possible pathway to convert alkenes to alkanes is via an oligomerization-cracking mechanism. At temperatures higher than 100, alkene oligomers decompose by a disproportionation mechanism to produce alkanes and some polyene species which remain on the catalyst [22]. The alkanes thus produced are rich in isobutane and isopentane. 3.2. Effect of calcination temperature of SO4'- lZr02 Fig. 5 shows the effect of calcination temperature of S02- 4 - /Zr02 on its activity for the secondary reactions. It is seen that there is a calcination temperature (ca. 650) that corresponds to maxima for i-C4 %, i-C5 % and C4 yields and to minima for C3 /C3 and C3 yields. The changes in catalytic properties are very steep in the vicinity of this optimum X. Song, A.

A similar finding was reported in a recent investigation of n-butane isomerization over SO4- /Zr02 [26]. The acid strength of S04- /Zr02 was studied by Hino and Arata [27] using the Hammett indicators. Samples calcined at 650 for 3 h showed the highest acid strength (Ho < - 16.04). This proves that the secondary reaction activity is an excellent probe for the acid strength on S04 - /Zr02. The sample showing the highest activity exhibits the highest acid strength. 3.3. Deactivation of SO4-lZr02 It was observed that despite hydrogen bracketing, SO4 - /Zr02 gradually loses its activity during the reaction. The deactivation pattern of 504- /Zr02 is shown in Fig. 6, using i-C4- % as a measure of SO4 - /Zr02 activity. As seen, the deactivation curves corresponding to different amounts of SO4- /Zr02 have almost the same slope, indicating that after each reaction period, the same amount of acid sites was deactivated. It has been reported that S04- /Zr02 may lose its activity via two mechanisms: (i) reduction of S'+ to lower oxidation states [28-30] or (ii) coke deposition on acidic sites [ 28,29 ] . If the deactivation of S04 2- /Zr02 shown in Fig. 6 resulted from its chemical reduction in flowing hydrogen, the length of exposure to hydrogen would have significant influence on the catalytic activity, i.e., the longer the reduction period, the more quickly the S2- 04 /Zr02 deactivates. To check the possible occurrence of such a deactivation mechanism, the following experiment was carried out. After seven reaction periods (Fig. 7, data point A), the SOQ- /Zr02 catalyst was purged with hydrogen at 250 overnight instead of 35 min. The i-C4 % obtained after an additional 5-min reaction is represented by data point B in Fig. 7. As seen, data point B fits the same deactivation trend as before the overnight purge by hydrogen. This indicates that prolonged exposure of the sample to hydrogen at 250 does not cause a stronger deactivation. Therefore a deactivation mech- 130 X. Song, A.

Another experiment was run to check if coking could be responsible for the deactivation of S04 - /Zr02. After five reaction periods (Fig. 8, data point A), the used SOQ- /Zr02 catalyst was discharged from the reactor, and calcined in air at 450 for 3 h. The calcined SOQ- /Zr02 was tested again following the same procedures as those for testing fresh SOQ- /Zr02. As shown in Fig. 8 (data point B), a full recovery of i-C4 % was observed. This indicates that the coke deposit oS02- n 4 /Zr02 is likely to be the main reason of the catalyst deactivation. In the earlier discussion on hydrocarbon selectivities, it was mentioned that alkene reactions on strong acid sites of SO4- /Zr02 involve oligomerization-cracking, skeletal isomerization and hydrogen transfer. The alkene oligomer intermediates are tightly bound to the surface and constitute a hydrogen reservoir for hydrogenation of alkenes on acid sites, X. Song, A.

These unsaturated species cannot leave the S04- /Zr02 catalyst because of their strong interaction with the surface. The net result is that catalytically active sites will be gradually blocked by these species [22], causing the deactivation of the catalyst. Efforts have been made in this work to stabilize S04 - /Zr02 activity under FTS condi tions. Two approaches were found to be effective. One is addition of small amounts of platinum to S04 2- /Zr02. Fig. 9 indicates that loading 1 wt.-% of platinum on S04 - /Zr02 greatly improves the catalyst stability (curve a). The other approach is simply mixing the FTS catalyst (RuNaY) with 504- /Zr021 instead of using them in separate layers. The origin of the improved stability of S04 - /Zr02 (Fig. 10, curve a) is probably related to the more readily available H \"atoms\" on the acid component by hydrogen spillover which is facilitated by the stronger interaction between the two components of the hybrid catalyst. However, i-CQ % thus obtained was lower than the initial value of i-C4 % obtained on the separate-layer catalyst configuration before deactivation (Fig. 10, curve c).

On average, everything else being equal, the average residence time of the primary FTS products on the superacid component is shorter in the mixed than in the layered configuration. This is also true when Pt/S04- /Zr02 is used (Fig. 9, curve b). Consequently, the amount of superacid to reach the same level of i-C4 % is higher in the mixture than in the layered configuration (Fig. 10, curves b and c). In summary, for S04-/Zr02, the mixture configuration is better because it gives a stable catalyst, while for pt/S04 - /Zr02, the separate-layer configuration is preferable because it not only shows a good stability but also corresponds to a higher efficiency. 3.4. Comparison between S04-lZr02 and zeolites Zeolites in their hydrogen forms are widely used as solid acid catalysts. To compare the ability of S04 - /Zr02 for producing isoalkanes from the primary FTS products with that of zeolites, hydrogen forms of zeolite Y, ZSM-5 and mordenite were used as acid components in the same way as SOQ - /Zr02 catalyst in a layered configuration. The results illustrated in Fig. 11 (filled bars) indicate that HM exhibits the highest i-C4 % after a fiveminute reaction period. One might therefore assume that S04- /Zr02 is less acidic than HM. However such a conclusion does not hold if the deactivation behaviors of the catalysts are taken into consideration. Fig. 12 depicts the i-CQ % and C /C; as a function of timeon-stream. It is seen that i-C4 % rapidly declines from 72% to 50% within 5 min, while C3 /C3 increases. To minimize the effect of catalyst deactivation, the catalysts were compared after one minute of reaction, as shown in Fig. 11 (open bars). All zeolite samples showed little variations in i-C4 % between one and five minutes of reaction. For 504- / Zr02, however, the difference between both data was significant. Fig. 11 shows that after -on-stream, both 4 /Zr02 and HM exhibit the highest i-C4 %- one minute of time S02- SS02- - % among the acid catalysts ince 4 /Zr02 and HM showed the highest initial '_C4 tested in this work, their acid properties were charactCrized using TPD technique.

Ammonia may react with the sulfate group upon adsorption and heating, which may change the structure of the sulfate group and therefore the acid properties of sulfated metal oxide. It may also promote the decomposition of the sulfate group and its removal from the structure. In addition, the acidity of the superacids is so strong that ammonia may decompose before it desorbs. Therefore aromatics have been used as alternative adsorbates to measure the acidic properties of superacids [ 32,33 ] . In the present study, both ammonia TPD and benzene TPD were conducted. The results in Table 3 indicate that compared to HM, sulfated zirconia has lower density of acid sites but higher acid strength. Since 504- /Zr02 and HK showed the same initial i-CQ %, it is inferred that the shortage of strong acid sites on HM was compensated by its large population of relatively weak acid sites.

It was found that the two catalysts are comparable to each other in acid site strength but differ in acid site nature. Acidity of ACH-bentonite is mostly of Lewis type while that of HY is mainly of Bronsted type. The coke make on ACH-bentonite was at least a factor of 2 greater than on HY. Therefore it was proposed that the sites responsible for coke formation are strong Lewis acid sites. For sulfated zirconia, IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine indicated that the acid sites on SO4 - /Zr02 are mostly of Lewis type [ 35 ] . Our TPD data in Table 3 have shown much stronger acidity of S04 - /Zr02 than that of HM. Yamaguchi [36] estimated that the acid strength of 504- /Zr02 is probably comparable to that of SbCls. The very strong Lewis acid sites are likely to be responsible for the rapid coking of the catalyst. It has been reported that the loading of platinum on SOQ - /Zr02 and the presence of hydrogen under reaction conditions can stabilize the activity of S04 - /Zr02 for hydrocarbon isomerization [ 14,15,37]. Our present work (Fig. 9) also showed the stabilization effect of platinum under FTS conditions. This stabilization effect has been explained by Ebitani et al. [37] as follows. A hydrogen molecule is adsorbed on the platinum particle, and then homolytically dissociates. The H atom obtained spills over the support and migrates to the Lewis acid site, where it releases an electron to convert into an H+, which then bonds to an oxygen ion near the Lewis acid site, thus generating a Bronsted acid site. Such a Bronsted acid site may then act as an active site for acid-catalyzed reactions. Parallel to this, Lewis acid sites intercept an electron and become weaker. The weakening of the Lewis acid in the presence of hydrogen is considered to be the origin of the decrease in deactivation. Another possible explanation is, as suggested by Iglesia et al. [ 38] , that carbocations on the catalyst surface tend to be scavenged by hydrides originating from heterolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen on platinum particles. The supply of hydrides decreases the residence time of reaction intermediates and prevents them from reacting further. The mechanism of stability improvement of physical mixtures of RuNaY and S04 - /Zr02 (Fig. 10) compared to layered catalysts may be similar to that involving pt/S04 - /Zr02, with ruthenium playing the same role as platinum. 4. Conclusion FTS was carried out over hybrid catalysts consisting of RuNaY and S04 - /Zr02. Under X. Song, A. Sayari /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994)121-136 135 the reaction conditions used in this work, the presence of sulfated zirconia did not contribute to carbon monoxide conversion but resulted in significant changes in hydrocarbon selectivities. With increasing amounts of sulfated zirconia, the yield of C3 hydrocarbons decreased while that of C4 increased; changes in the yields of Ct, C2, C5 and C6 hydrocarbons were minor; more isoalkanes and less alkenes were formed. All these changes were attributed to secondary reactions that primary FTS products undergo over the strongly acidic sulfated zirconia. These secondary reactions involved oligomerization-cracking, skeletal isomerization, hydrogen transfer and coking. Calcination temperature of sulfated zirconia had a strong effect on its activity for the secondary reactions. The coke deposition on sulfated zirconia was identified to be the main reason of the catalyst deactivation. The very strong Lewis acid sites are proposed to be responsible for the rapid coking deactivation. Addition of small amounts of platinum on S04 2- /Zr02 or mixing SOQ - /Zr02 with the FTS catalyst instead of using them in separate layers led to significant improvement of the overall stability of the hybrid catalyst.
