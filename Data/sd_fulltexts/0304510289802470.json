A. RYNDIN,* 0. S. ALEKSEEV, P. A. SIMONOV and V. A. LIKHOLOBOV Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 (U.S.S.R.) Summary Catalysts containing particles of metallic palladium have been synthe- sized by anchoring metal complex precursors on carbon supports (active carbon, carbon black, ultra-dispersed graphite and diamond). Anchored pre- cursors were obtained by interaction of solutions of tetrachloride or allylcy- clopentadienyl palladium complexes with the supports. Based on data on the peculiarities of HgPdC^ adsorption on carbon sorbents of different natures, three types of adsorption sites of Pd\" ions have been identified and a quantitative evaluation of their strengths made. The size of the Pd crystallite formed upon reduction of the anchored complexes and its catalytic activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation depend upon the strength of the adsorption site. An increase in the strength of the adsorption site leads to a decrease both in the size and catalytic activity of Pd crystal- lites. The effect observed is associated with a modifying (ligand) action of atoms involved in the adsorption site. Fourier transform IR spectroscopic data indicate that the interaction of C3HgPdC5H5 with an oxidized diamond surface occurs with participation of the carboxyl groups of the support. According to transmission electron microscopic data, Pd/C catalysts reduced with hydrogen at 300 C contain Pd particles 10 - 20 A in size. On increasing the reduction temperature to 600 C, the dispersion of Pd/diamond remains almost unchanged while the size of the metallic particles on Pd/graphite increases to 100 A. This difference is due to peculiarities in the interaction of Pd particles with graphite and diamond surfaces in a hydrogen atmosphere. In the structurally insensitive hydrogena- tion of benzene, the turnover number (TON) activity of the Pd/C catalyst is commensurable with that of Pd/SiOg, but in the structurally sensitive hy- drogenolysis of ethane and hydrogenation of CO to methanol, the TON of Pd/C is one to two orders of magnitude lower, probably due to dissolution of carbon atoms in the Pd particles. Introduction of Zr ions into Pd/C leads to the appearance of a new absorption band at 1600 cm\"1 in the IR spectrum of adsorbed CO, an increase in TON activity by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in methanol synthesis and a drastic decrease in activity in ethane hydrogenolysis, the inhibiting effect of Zr ions being completely suppressed by high-temperature oxidation of the samples. These specific features are similar to those observed earlier for 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 110 (Pd+Zr)/Si02 and Pd/ZrOg, and seem to be due to the formation of mixed Pd-Zr active sites in the systems under consideration. Introduction Carbon materials are interesting subjects for the study of the effect of the nature of the support on the formation of active sites in supported catalysts obtained from metal complex precursors. The carbon surface has functional groups necessary for anchoring the initial metal complexes and small (non-stoichiometric) amounts of oxygen. Thus, processes involving the oxidation of highly dispersed metallic particles of low-valent metal ions by surface oxygen, for example, are excluded. As distinct from oxide supports, graphite-like carbon materials are characterized by a layered structure, so that the supported compound can be located on both basal and edge planes. In the general, anchoring of the precursor can be accomplished via: (i) donor-acceptor interaction of the metal ion with olefin fragments formed by carbon atoms located at the layer boundaries; (ii) covalent binding with hydroxyl-containing groups (oxidized areas of the carbon material) also located on the edge planes of graphite-like microcrystals; and (iii) dispersion interactions between the basal planes of graphite-like microcrystals and ligands of an aromatic type. For diamond-like forms of carbon, reactions of organometallic complexes with surface carboxyl groups seem to be most suitable for anchoring active site precursors. The objectives of this work were to: (1) Examine the effect of the strength of donor-acceptor surface sites on carbon materials of different natures upon the size and catalytic activity of Pd particles formed from anchored complexes localized at these sites. (2) Study the principles involved in the formation of metallic Pd parti- cles from metal complex precursors supported via the interaction of organometallic compounds with oxygen-containing groups of carbon supports having graphite- and diamond-like structures, and to compare their physico- chemical and catalytic properties. (3) Synthesize Pd particles on carbon supports modified by Zr ions by a tailor-made method, and study the catalytic properties of such catalysts in processes which are traditionally used for the consideration of 'strong metal- support interaction' effects. Experimental Catalyst preparation Palladium metal catalysts supported on carbon materials were obtained by Hg reduction of Pd complexes anchored using the following methods: (a) adsorption of Pd11 ions on carbon supports from aqueous solutions of Ill H^PdCIt; (b) interaction of allylic Pd complexes with oxygen-containing surface groups on carbon supports; and (c) interaction of allylic Pd com- plexes with low-valent Zr ions initially anchored on the carbon support surface. Support preparation Various types of carbon support, i.e. active carbon PN, carbon black PME-800, graphite-like 'Sibunit' carbon [I], and ultradisperse 'Altunit' dia- mond [2], were employed. Such supports were purified initially by boiling in 17% HC1 and 5% HF to remove mineral admixtures, followed by washing with water, alcohol and drying in vacuo at 100 C. Oxidative modification of 'Sibunit' carbon was performed as described previously [3]. Chemical analysis of the surface oxygen groups on the initial and oxidized samples of 'Sibunit' carbon was undertaken by titration methods [4]. Prior to supporting Zr and Pd allylic complexes, 'Sibunit' and 'Altunit' supports were oxidized by heating in air at 300 C and then outgassed at 300 C at a pressure of 10-3 Torr. Support studies Wide-angle X-ray scattering analyses of supports were made on a DRON diffractometer (using CuK, radiation) [5]. Adsorption isotherms of HgPdCLi on the carbon supports were obtained at 20 C. The concentration of HzPdCLi in solution was determined spec- trophotometrically and the palladium content on the support was found from the difference in HgPdC^ concentrations in solution before and after contact with the support, as well as by a flame absorption method. The concentration of Cl~ ions adsorbed on the support was determined by silver titration from the difference between the total Cl~ content in the HgPdCli solutions before and after contact with the support (HgPdC^ having been reduced to Pd black by the use of metallic magnesium). The state of adsorbed palladium was obtained by XPS examination using a VG ESCALAB spectrometer (using A1K, radiation) and high-resolution transmission elec- tron microscopy (HRTEM) using a JEOL 100CX microscope (ca. 2 A resolu- tion). Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of Pd/C samples were performed using monochromatic CuK,, radiation within the angular range 20 = 7' - 7 . IR spectra were obtained at 25 C with a Bruker IRS-113 Fourier transform spectrometer over the spectral range 1300-4000 cm\"1 (resolution 4 cm\"1). Diamond powder was pressed into tablets of 20mgcm-2 density, placed in an IR cell and individual steps in the reaction of C3H5PdC5H5 with the oxidized diamond surface investigated in situ. In addition, CO adsorption was studied on the final catalyst sample placed in the IR cell. Benzene hydrogenation was performed in a static circulation system at 90 C, PcoHg = 50 Torr and P^ = 300 Torr. Ethane hydrogenolysis was carried out in a similar system at 350 C, Pc^e = 50 Torr and P^ = 150 Torr using chromatographic analysis of the reaction products. The catalytic activity in 112 both reactions was calculated by differentiation of the initial part of the conversion versus time curve. Finally, CO hydrogenation was performed in a differential flow reactor at 250 C at a mixture pressure of 10 atm, V = 20 000 h-1, CO:H2 = 1:2 and a conversion of < 1%. Results and discussion Catalysts obtained from H^PdCl^ Peculiarities of H^PdCl^ adsorption on carbon supports. Isotherms relat- ing to the adsorption of HgPdCLi on the carbon supports are of Langmuir type (Fig. 1). They are characterized by a very steep initial section (0-0.50) corresponding to almost complete removal of Pd11 from the solution in contact with the support. The adsorption of H^PdC^ occurs virtually without any change in the pH of the system, the Clads/Pdads atomic ratio at average surface coverages of the support (0.5 - 0.80) being 2.12 0.14 [3]. From the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the surface compounds (where E^ changed from 336.8 to 337.2 eV as a function of the surface coverage), it follows that the adsorbed Pd is mainly in the form of Pd\". Electron micrographs of these samples showed no reflections whose contrast could be attributed to metallic Pd particles. The above data suggest that the sorption of Pd11 from aqueous HgPdC^ solutions by the carbon support occurs predominantly via the following scheme: Hz PdCl4 + A ^ PdClg A + 2HC1 (1) where A is an adsorption site on the support surface.

With this in mind, the support containing the adsorbed Pd compounds was washed with solutions of different compounds or organic solvents until a negative reaction between KI and the Pd11 in the eluate was achieved. Then the amount of residual Pd in the samples was determined. As a result, three adsorption states of HgPdCl, have been distinguished: weak (Ai), strong (Ag) and very strong (Aa). Palladium(II) when adsorbed on Ai sites may be removed from the support surface by washing with acetone or water, while Pd11 adsorbed on Az sites is not removed either by acetone or by aqueous solutions of HC104, HN03 or H2S04; it can, however, be desorbed by the action of HC1 or HBr acids and their salts with alkali metals. Palladium(II) adsorbed on Ay sites cannot be removed from the surface by any eluent. The content of Ai, Ag and A3 sites increases with increasing specific surface area of the support (Table 1); Ai and Ag sites are present in approximately equal quantities, while the content of A3 sites is smaller by an order of magnitude. Thus, the adsorption isotherms of HgPdC^ reflect the interaction of Pd11 with the different types of surface site. The initial parts of these isotherms (the 0 - 0.50 region) correspond to the adsorption of HgPdC^ on Ag and A3, while the curves at saturation correspond to adsorption on the Ai sites [3]. Nature of the H^PdCl^ adsorption sites. PME-800, PN and 'Sibunit' samples with different Pd content on the surface have been studied by XPS methods. At low surface coverages of PME-800, two Pd11 states exist with E^, values for the Pd Sd^ level equal to 336.8 and 339.7 eV, respectively [Fig. 2(a)]. Consequently, in comparison with the E), value for the Pd Sd^ level for PdClz alone (337.5 - 337.9 eV [6, 7]), when PdClg is adsorbed there is a shift in the Pd 3d lines towards both low and high binding energies. A decrease in E^ for the Pd 3dg/2 level appears to be associated with the donor properties of the adsorption sites. Such sites may be elements of the n -system of the carbon TABLE 1 Structural and adsorption properties of carbon supports Carbon S^T Fraction Adsorption properties support (n^g\"1) of crystalline phase Adsorption site content Adsorption (%) (mgeqg\"1) constants Ai Aa As Xi 20% Ky, (moldm-3) 10% PN- 950 0 0.660 0.534 0.100 0.12 1050 PME-8001' 770 27 0.573 0.457 0.068 0.09 400 'Sibunit\" 400 65 0.210 0.187 0.023 0.14 300 Active carbon.

An increase in E^ for the Pd 3cL;/2 level can result from the interaction of Pd11 with electron-deficient ligands. Note that an Eb value for the Pd Sdg/g level of about 339.5 eV is characteristic of palladium acetylenide [6, 7]. An increase in the total amount of Pd11 adsorbed leads to a shift in the Pd 3d5/2 line component which is characterized by a low value of E^ in the range 336.8 to 337.2 eV. In this case, the position of the line component with an increased E^ value remains unchanged although its contribution to the total Pd 3d spectrum decreases [Fig. 2(b - c)]. Taking the data on Pd11 desorp- tion on PME-800 listed in Table 1 into account, it is possible to conclude that the Pd 3d5/2 line with E^ = 339.7 eV may be attributed to Pd\" adsorbed on Ay sites, while the Pd3d5/a line with E^ = 336.8 - 337.2 eV corresponds to Pd11 adsorbed on to Ag and Ai sites. In order to elucidate the role of oxygen-containing groups on the surface in HgPdC^ adsorption, a series of supports obtained by oxidative treatment of 'Sibunit' carbon has been studied. Oxidation of the support surface resulted in a decrease in its adsorption capacity with respect to HgPdCl,, due primarily to a decrease in the content of Aa and Ay sites (Table 2). Thus, the HgPdC^ adsorption sites exhibit different reactivities towards oxidants: 'strong' adsorption sites (Ag and A3) are the most sensitive whilst 115 TABLE 2 Adsorption characteristics of 'Sibunit' carbon after surface oxidation and subsequent thermal desorption of chemisorbed oxygen Modification conditions SBET (n^g-1) Total c carbon: phenyl ketone (mgeq ;ontent ofyl,and groups g-1) Adsorption (mgeqg-1) site content Ai A;, Aa initial state 1.2% H202,20 C 4% KMnO<, 20 C oxidized by KMnC>4, evacuated at 600 C for 5 h 400 390 370370 0.300 0.460 0.5100.221 0.210 0.210 0.2050.215 0.187 0.130 0.1100.131 0.023 0.009 0.0150.023 'weak' adsorption sites (Ai) are less so. However, after thermal desorption of most of the chemisorbed oxygen at 600 C, the concentrations of the HgPdC^ adsorption sites approach those for the initial support (Table 2). Thus, oxygen-containing groups do not interact with Pd\" in hydrochloric acid medium, and H^PdC^ adsorption occurs on the non-oxidized surface parts of the supports. The HgPdC^ adsorption sites may be fragments of the n-elec- tron system of the support, since PdClg is known to form n -complexes readily with various unsaturated organic compounds even in acidic aqueous solu- tions [8]. It is probable that similar Pd11 complexes can also form on the surface of the carbon support. Carbon materials having a graphitic structure possess surfaces which are a combination of basal and edge planes of carbon crystallites, the edge planes being more reactive towards oxidants [4]. In this context it may be suggested that A^ and Ag sites, which disappear upon mild oxidation of the surface, are located on the edge planes of crystallites, while Ai sites which are more stable to oxidation seem to be located on the basal planes of carbon crystallites (Fig. 3). Quantitative estimation of adsorption site strengths.

(a) Possible sites for weak (Ai), strong (Ag) and very strong (irreversible, A3) adsorption of PdCl^ on carbon and (b) the proposed nature of the chemical interaction of Pd with these sites. The parameters in eqn. (3) for Pd\" adsorption on Ag sites have not been determined, since the adsorption equilibrium is always shifted completely towards the formation of Pd11 surface compounds. However, such parameters for the interaction of H^PdC^ with Aa sites have been calculated from data on Pd\" adsorption from hydrochloric acid solutions ([HC1] = 0.8 - 4.01^^ \" ) and for the interaction of Pd11 with Ai sites from the data on HzPdC^ adsorption from aqueous solutions. Computations have shown that, during Pd\" adsorption on Ai and Ag sites, mononuclear complexes are formed with the value of K^ remaining unchanged as the nature of the support is varied. The value of K^ increased with decreasing proportions of crystalline phase in the samples (Table 1). This interesting result confirms the conclu- sion that Ai and Ag sites are located on basal and edge planes of microcrys- tals, respectively, because a change in the nature of the carbon support would have the greatest influence on events occurring on edge planes (interlayer distances, defects, etc.) Effect of adsorption site strength on the size and catalytic properties of Pd particles formed via surface complex reduction. An increase in the adsorption site strength leads to a decrease in the size of the Pd particles formed from the adsorbed metal complex precursors (Table 3). This phenomenon may be accounted for by stabilization of the Pd particles through adsorption on Ag and A3 sites, as occurs for low-valent ions anchored on SiOg surfaces which act as specific energy traps for platinum metal atoms [9]. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of Pd particles formed from Pd complexes adsorbed on Ag + A3 sites decreases with an increase in the 117 TABLE 3 Average size (A) of Pd particles adsorbed on A^ + Ag sites [Pd/(Aa + A3)] after reduction with H^ at 250 C for 3 h Carbon support K^ (?

Such a decrease can hardly be associated with a decrease in the Pd dispersion, since the size of the particles tends to decrease (Table 3). This appears to be due to a modifying effect exerted by the nature of the adsorption site on the catalytic properties of dispersed metallic particles, as observed for systems obtained by the reduction of bimetallic surface complexes containing noble and Group IV - VII metal ions [9]. Catalysts obtained from CyHsPdCsH^ Formation of the Pdfdiamond catalyst. IR spectra of the products aris- ing from the interaction of C3HBPdC5HB with an oxidized diamond surface are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum of the support (spectrum 1) exhibits a broad absorption band at 3400 cm\"1 and an intense band at 1750 cm\"1 attributed respectively to OH and C=0 stretching vibrations associated with surface carboxyl groups [10,11]. After adsorption of C3H5PdC5H5 on the oxidized diamond, the resulting spectrum (spectrum 2) shows a sharp decrease in the intensity of the absorp- tion band at 1750 cm\"! ascribed to carboxyl groups, and the appearance of a broad, very intense absorption band at 3080-3000 cm-1, along with further bands at 1400 and 1330 cm\"1. According to Fritz [12], the broad unresolved band at 3080 - 3000 cm\"! may be attributed to the superposition of the bands at 3066 cm~1 and 3011 cm\"! corresponding to the C H stretching vibrations. Furthermore, the bands at 1400 and 1330cm\"1 correspond to the C^-C vibrations of the organic ligands in the Pd complex. This provides evidence for the existence of a chemical reaction between the supported Pd complex 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 \\l,cm-' Fig. 4.

Sintering behaviour of Pd on graphite and diamond. Electron micro- scopic data indicate that the Pd/graphite catalyst when reduced at 300 C con- tains metallic particles with a mean surface size (3y) of 22 A, the particle size distribution (PSD) curve being monomodal, symmetric and very narrow. On increasing the temperature of the Pd/graphite catalyst treatment with hydro- gen to 600 C, the value ofaTg increases to 100 A. When reduced in Hg at 300 C, the Pd/diamond catalyst contains Pd particles of size < 10 A; on increasing the reduction temperature to 600 C, ^ remains virtually unchanged. The values of Jg obtained by HRTEM are in good agreement with hydrogen titration (HT) results and have been used below for the calculation of the fraction of surface atoms present (Pdg/Pdf). The dependence of the Pdg/Pdt values on the reduction temperature is shown in Fig. 5, from which 119 200 400 600 Reduction temperature , C Fig. 5.

Filled and open symbols correspond, respectively, to dispersions as determined by HT and HRTEM. it is seen that the sintering of Pd particles decreases in the order: graphite > SiOg > diamond. Thus, differences in the crystallographic modifi- cations present in the carbon supports employed account for the greater sintering of Pd/graphite relative to Pd/diamond. Peculiarities in the electronic, chemisorption and catalytic properties of PdjC relative to PdlSiOy. From the XPS data, it follows that the E^, value of the Pd ads/a level in the Pd/graphite catalyst reduced at 300 C is 335.8 eV, which is close to the E^, value for Pd/SiOa at the same dispersion level as well as that for Pd evaporated on graphite under ultra-high vacuum conditions at small coverages, i.e. at a high dispersion of Pd [13]. The E^ value of the Pd 3d^ level for Pd/diamond is 334.5 eV, which is 1.3 eV less than that for Pd/SiOg at approximately the same dispersion. The IR spectrum of CO adsorbed on Pd/diamond under 70 Torr pressure exhibits absorption bands at 2095 cm\"1 and 1940 cm\"1 characteristic of linear and bridged CO forms. The turnover number (TON) activity of Pd/graphite in benzene hydrogenation is commensurable with the TON activity of Pd/SiOa, but the TON of Pd/diamond is four times lower than that of Pd/SiOg catalysts (Table 5). Such a difference in the TON activity of the Pd/diamond catalyst seems to be due to the effect of the support which leads to excess electronic density on the Pd atoms resulting in a decrease in the binding strength of the CgHg molecule and in its hydrogenation rate. The TON activity of both Pd/C catalysts in ethane hydrogenolysis, regardless of the crystallographic structure of carbon, is almost two orders of magnitude less than that of Pd/SiOg (Table 5). If account is taken of the fact that the reaction is structurally insensitive, that a correlation between the TABLE 5 Effect of support on the catalytic properties of Pd reduced with H^ at 300 C Catalyst composition Dispersion (Pd./Pd.)

Such a solid solution is stable in hydrogen up to temperatures above 400 C [14]. In methanol synthesis, the TON activity of Pd/graphite is almost one order of magnitude lower than that of Pd/SiOg, while that of Pd/diamond is only three times less that of Pd/SiOa (Table 5). This result is in qualitative agreement with previous data [15] which indicated a lower activity for Pd/graphite in comparison with Pd/SiOg. Effect of Zr ions on PdfC properties Peculiarities in the electronic and chemisorption properties of (Pd + Zr)j C relative to unmodified Pd. Supporting (7c-C3Hg)4Zr on oxidized diamond leads to a dramatic decrease in the IR spectral intensity of the absorption band corresponding to carboxyl groups and to the appearance of a band typical of allyl ligands. This indicates the occurrence of a reaction with carboxyl groups. Treatment of the anchored Zr complex with hydrogen is accompanied by the disappearance of the absorption band ascribed to allyl ligands which appears to be due to their removal from the surface of the modified support. During the subsequent adsorption of C3H5PdC5H5, the typical bands for the organic ligands of the Pd complex appear although the intensity of that ascribed to carboxyl groups remains almost unchanged. It is thus possible that the Pd complex interacts with coordinatively unsatu- rated zirconium ions on the support surface. Reduction of the (Pd -+ Zr)/dia- mond catalyst results in the complete removal of the ligands of the Pd complex. According to XPS data, the oxidation number of Zr in the reduced (Pd+Zr)/graphite catalyst is III or IV. Hence the bond between the Zr ions and the oxygen of the support is preserved after reduction of the anchored complex with hydrogen. Thus, either isolated coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions or their two-dimensional ionic associates are present in the reduced Zr/C catalyst. On supporting Pd over Zr/C, a slight positive shift (0.5 - 0.6 eV) of the Zr3d5/2 line occurs regardless of the crystallographic modification of the support. The presence of such a shift may indicate an interaction between the surface Zr ions and Pd atoms. With Pd supported on modified graphite and diamond, a positive shift of the Pd 3d line by 0.5 eV relative to the value with Pd/C has been observed. Since the Pd dispersion is hardly changed in this case, this result must indicate the generation of an electron-deficient state of Pd due to its interac- tion with Zr cations. Electron microscopic data show that reduction of (Pd + Zr)/C at moder- ate temperatures leads to Pd particles with sizes of < 20 A and < 10 A on graphite and diamond, respectively. The IR spectra arising from the absorption of CO on (Pd + Zr)/diamond, 122 D 0.50 0.25 0 2200 2000 1800 1600 -5, cm\"1 Fig. 6. IR spectra for CO adsorption on (1.0% Pd + 12% Zr)/diamond reduced at 300 C. obtained by subtracting the background and gas-phase spectra, are shown in Fig. 6. At low partial pressures of CO (Pco) Ihe spectrum exhibits an additional absorption band at 1600 cm\"1, along with bands typical of CO adsorbed in the linear and bridged forms. Increasing Pco ^d thus the Pd surface coverage (@co). leads to an increase in the intensities of the three absorption bands virtually in the same manner. Under these circumstances, the bands corresponding to the linear and bridged forms are shifted to higher frequencies by 10 and 30 cm\"1, respectively. A distinctive feature of the spectrum of CO adsorbed on (Pd + Zr)/dia- mond in comparison with that for CO on Pd/diamond is the presence of an additional adsorption band at 1600 cm\"1 (see Fig. 6). For metals on transition metal oxides, the existence of a new state of CO adsorbed on mixed active sites consisting of the active metal atom and the transition metal ion has been predicted theoretically [16]. An analysis of the types of CO coordination in carbonyl clusters [16] suggests that a band corresponding to a new state of adsorbed CO may lie within the range 1600 -1700 cm-1. In fact, an absorption band at 1620 cm-1 has been reported [16] for Rh/ZrOa and attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO adsorbed on the metal-oxide boundary. Thus, an increase in the intensity of the band at 1600 cm\"! observed in this work upon increasing Pco, as well as reported in the literature [16,17], makes it possible to ascribe this band to a molecule of CO bound to the Pd atom through the carbon atom and to the Zr ion through the oxygen atom.

This effect seems to be due to an interaction between the Pd atoms and Zr atoms. In fact, high-temperature oxidation of (Pd + Zr)/C completely eliminates the inhibiting effect of Zr ions, probably as a result of the oxidation and segregation of components. In CO hydrogenation, the TON activity of Pd supported on carbon modified with Zr ions is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than the TON activity of Pd/C, with a noticeable increase in selectivity towards methanol being observed. The observed adsorption and catalytic effects of Zr ions on the proper- ties of Pd/C are similar to those found earlier for the (Pt+ Zr)/Si02 system [9,18]. Thus, regardless of the nature of the support, the modifying actions of Zr ions on the properties of the supported metal are of a fairly general character. A similar change in adsorption and catalytic properties has been ob- served when Pd is supported on bulk ZrOz [9,18]. Moreover, the effects observed are typical of the so-called strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) that occurs when Group VIII metals are supported on transition metal oxides [19]. Such a qualitative analogy between the properties of the experimental Pt/ZrOa and model (Pt + Zr)/Si02 systems has led to the conclusion that the active sites in these two systems must have a similar nature, i.e. they consist of metal atoms stabilized on surface Zr cations [9,18]. Our results for the (Pd + Zr)/C system provide additional support for the validity of this sugges- tion. Regardless of the chemical nature of the support (SiOg or C), the modifying action of Zr ions is the same as that observed when an active metal is supported on ZrOg. The similar properties of Pd observed when the metal is supported on modified graphite and diamond suggest that the collective properties of the support (electroconductivity in the case of graphite) do not play a significant role in the mechanism of SMSI, i.e. the predominant factor is the local chemical interaction of metal atoms with transition metal ions.

Ryndin ∗ O.S. Alekseev P.A. Simonov V.A. Likholobov Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 U.S.S.R. Catalysts containing particles of metallic palladium have been synthesized by anchoring metal complex precursors on carbon supports (active carbon, carbon black, ultra-dispersed graphite and diamond). Anchored precursors were obtained by interaction of solutions of tetrachloride or allylcyclopentadienyl palladium complexes with the supports. Based on data on the peculiarities of HgPdCl4 adsorption on carbon sorbents of different natures, three types of adsorption sites of PdII ions have been identified and a quantitative evaluation of their strengths made. The size of the Pd crystallite formed upon reduction of the anchored complexes and its catalytic activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation depend upon the strength of the adsorption site. An increase in the strength of the adsorption site leads to a decrease both in the size and catalytic activity of Pd crystallites. The effect observed is associated with a modifying (ligand) action of atoms involved in the adsorption site. Fourier transform IR spectroscopic data indicate that the interaction of C3H5PdC5H5 with an oxidized diamond surface occurs with participation of the carboxyl groups of the support. According to transmission electron microscopic data, Pd/C catalysts reduced with hydrogen at 300 °C contain Pd particles 10 – 20 Å in size. On increasing the reduction temperature to 600 °C, the dispersion of Pd/diamond remains almost unchanged while the size of the metallic particles on Pd/graphite increases to 100 Å. This difference is due to peculiarities in the interaction of Pd particles with graphite and diamond surfaces in a hydrogen atmosphere. In the structurally insensitive hydrogenation of benzene, the turnover number (TON) activity of the Pd/C catalyst is commensurable with that of Pd/SiO2, but in the structurally sensitive hydrogenolysis of ethane and hydrogenation of CO to methanol, the TON of Pd/C is one to two orders of magnitude lower, probably due to dissolution of carbon atoms in the Pd particles. Introduction of Zr ions into Pd/C leads to the appearance of a new absorption band at 1600 cm−1 in the IR spectrum of adsorbed CO, an increase in TON activity by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude in methanol synthesis and a drastic decrease in activity in ethane hydrogenolysis, the inhibiting effect of Zr ions being completely suppressed by high-temperature oxidation of the samples. These specific features are similar to those observed earlier for (Pd+Zr)/SiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, and seem to be due to the formation of mixed Pd-Zr active sites in the systems under consideration.
