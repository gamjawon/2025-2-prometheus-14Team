Benha Egypt Graphical abstract Silver nanoparticles successfully incorporated in titanate nanosheets and synthesized hydrothermally via employing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and triblock copolymer (pluronic F127) assisted templates were thoroughly characterized using transmission electron microscopy-selected area electron diffraction (TEM-SAED), X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV/visible absorption spectroscopy, N2 sorptiometry, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The dispersed Ag nanoparticles of uniform size (2–3nm) were found to contact intimately with titanateF127 nanosheets to show superior crystallinity, wider layer distances and higher surface area and pore volume (SBET =51.1m2 g−1,Vp =0.081cm3g−1) than Ag/titanateCTAB (7.2m2 g−1, 0.02cm3 g−1). This constructed Ag/titanateF127 exhibits markedly improved electrocatalytic (1.4-fold) and photoelectrocatalytic (4.0-fold) activities and stabilities towards methanol oxidation than that of Ag/titanateCTAB; as determined using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The enhanced activity of Ag/titanateF127 was also attributed to electron transfer across the interface potential of the composite Ag-titanateF127 as well as the delay of charge recombination that has been substantiated not only via exposed Ag but also through the non-decomposed carbon template. This enhanced electron transfer and electronic conductivity was established by impedance spectroscopy, and exhibits the maximum obtained photocurrent density (2.0mAcm−2) under visible light illumination (λ>420nm, 88W). The results revealed that the template F127 had a significant effect not only on enhancing the titanate crystallinity and exhibiting a surface plasmon resonance band; unlike Ag/titanateCTAB, but also in acquiring a high pore volume value and widened layers, which all work towards improving the Ag-titanateF127 durability for methanol oxidation. Keywords Methanol oxidation Ag/titanate Surfactant template Electrochemical properties Photocurrent 1 Introduction Nowadays, researchers have developed efficient and practical sources of energy such as solar cells, lithium ion batteries, water splitting for H2 generation and direct alcohol fuel cells [1–4]. Specifically, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have become increasingly attractive as energy sources for use in various mobile devices [5–7]. Consequently, more attention has been paid by researchers for developing efficient ways for converting and storing large amounts of energy. However, there are some drawbacks about the materials used in DMFCs which relate to the high catalyst cost, low kinetic efficiency and fast poisoning [8,9]. Accordingly, utilization of anodic electrodes other than Pt have attracted the attention of many researchers for methanol electro-oxidation such as nickel-based materials [10,11] as well as their alloys [12,13]. Other Pt substituent’s such as palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium were also employed, however their efficiencies did not improve much and sometimes they were lower than Pt based catalysts [14,15]. On the other hand, the choice of the support is very important in many issues, especially if it offers good interaction with the catalyst to govern not only the charge transfer [16] but also to control the catalyst loss. Good electrical conductivity and larger surface area maximizes also the fuel cell efficiency. Simultaneously, carbon supports such as Vulcan XC-72 that has been used as an appropriate support for Pt while performing DMFC has been replaced by other supports such as nanostructured carbon mesoporous carbon, carbon nanotubes, nanodiamond, carbon nanofibers and graphene [17–20]. The examination of non-carbonaceous based supports is very important in the context of carbon support corrosion and the resultant consequences, such as catalyst loss, which significantly affect the overall performance of the fuel cell. In this work, we discuss the performance, potential and issues connected with the use of titanates as non-carbon based supports, when supported Ag nanoparticles are applied as an anode catalyst in DMFC; as a substitute for the most common only used Pt. Fundamentally, the performance of such system is directly related to the material properties. Therefore, material technology plays a critical role in the development of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Accordingly, titanium nanotubes of excellent chemical stability have shown unique advantages in the photocatalytic applications since their 1D structure offers direct paths for photo-generated electron transfer, and thus increases the efficiency of charge separation [21–23]. Furthermore, 1D structured catalysts possess larger active surface-to-volume ratios and thus assist the photocatalytic reaction within the electrolyte [24,25]. On the other hand, a comprehensive study concerning titanate supported Ag for DMFC was reported by Mohamed et al. [26] and in addition during forming composites with graphene and MWCNT. The superior electrical conductivity of Ag/titanate as well as the low resistivity and the larger surface area have shown improved electrochemical methanol oxidation [26]. Besides, the exhibited strong metal support interaction and the consequences thereof, including the facile electron transfer and particles size decrement promoted the oxidation of methanol. This has stimulated us to use another strategy for the synthesis of Ag/titanates. Accordingly, we have used cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and pluronic F127 surfactants to appropriately organize titanate networks in relation to stabilization and potential functionalization of Ag nanoparticles. Structure, surface, optical and morphological characterization were well determined using XRD, TEM-SAED, N2 sorptiometry, UV–vis diffuse reflectance, Raman and FTIR spectrometry. These materials were then evaluated as DMFCs to try correlating the structure-activity relationship for maximum optimization and utilization. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of titanateCTAB and titanateF127 and their Ag supported ones Into 20ml titanium isopropoxide, 0.036g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) dissolved in 100ml NaOH (10M) was added drop-wisely to form a gelatinous solution, which left under stirring for 4h. This gelatinous solution was then left at room temperature for 4h, then hydrothermally autoclaved at 373K for 72h. Afterward, it was filtered and washed with a water-ethanol mixture, followed by drying at 373K and calcining at 673K for 6h. A portion of uncalcined titanateCTAB was used to prepare 3%Ag-titanateCTAB via suspending the former in a mixture of ethanol-water then leaving it stirring for 2h followed by sonication at 313K for 1.0h. Exposing of the latter mixture into an UV Hg lamp (λ=256, power=100W) for 25min to confirm complete reduction of Ag ions into Ag nanoparticles was accomplished. Then, the sample was dried at 373K overnight and finally calcined at 673K for 4h. This sample is denoted as 3%Ag-titanateCTAB. Similarly, Pluronic F₁₂₇ (HO(CH2CH2O)100(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2-CH2O)100H), which was dissolved in ethanol-water mixture together with titanium iso-propoxide, was used as a template similar to CTAB. The resulting clear solution was mixed thoroughly for 2h and then aged for 5h at ambient temperature. Then, 30ml 10M NaOH was added step wisely till complete precipitation. That precipitate was transferred into a Teflon lined autoclave to be treated hydrothermally at 373K for 72h. Subsequently to hydrothermal treatment, the products were recovered by centrifugation and then washed 3 times with deionized water. The solids were isolated by filtration and washing with deionized water, and then dried overnight at 333K. They were further calcined in air at 673K for 6h to remove the copolymer template. This sample was denoted as titanateF127. A portion of the uncalcined titanate127 was suspended in water and a solution of AgNO3 was added in a slow way to prepare 3wt% Ag/titanate127 followed by sonication at 315K for 1.0h. Then, this mixture was exposed into the Hg UV lamp; similarly to the CTAB assisted sample, to reduce Ag ions. Subsequently, the sampled was dried at 373K overnight and finally calcined at 673K for 4h. This sample is denoted as 3%Ag-titanateF127. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns were carried out using a Philips 321/00 instrument operating with Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation (l=1.541Å) at 36kV and 16mA. The surface texturing properties namely SBET surface area, total pore volume (Vp) and mean pore radius (r) were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77K using a volumetric apparatus. Raman spectra were measured by means of U-1000 laser Raman spectrometer using the 488nm line of an ArC laser as the excitation beam. The FT-IR spectra were monitored via a single beam Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 instrument in the 4000–400cm−1 region. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of synthesized materials were obtained with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (JASCO Corp., V-570) with an integrating sphere attachment in the margin 200–800nm. TEM micrographs and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were measured using a FEI model Tecnai G20 (Super twin) with double tilt 1010 operating at an accelerating voltage of 200KV. 2.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methanol oxidation Voltammetric measurements were carried out in a standard three electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature (25°C) with an autolab PGSTAT204 attached with Nova 1.11 software for data processing. The titanateF127, Ag/titanatesF127, titanatesCTAB and Ag/titanatesCTAB electrodes were used as working electrodes at an area equal 1.0cm2. These electrodes were systematically prepared via mixing with the carbon black and PVDF with ratios of 85:10:5 respectively, and then loaded onto the FTO conducting glass. The deposited electrodes were transferred to the electrochemical cell with or without acidified (0.5M H2SO4) CH3OH of 0.6M concentration. A thin platinum electrode was used as a counter electrode whereas the saturated Hg/Hg2SO4 (MSE) electrode was served as a reference electrode, where all potentials were referred to the MSE. The cyclic measurement sweep between −0.8V and 1.3V with scan rate of 10mVs−1 was adopted unless otherwise stated. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at the scan rate of 10mVs−1 in the acidic aqueous solution. The amperometric I–t curves were recorded in the acidic aqueous solution at 0.2V for 1000s. A visible light (of wavelength >420nm) 88W Hg lamp was used as a light source and the photocurrent measurement was determined via using LSV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements performed on the same apparatus (autolab PGSTAT204) were performed with amplitudes of 10mV in the frequency range 100 kHz-0.1Hz. The justification of the impedance spectra was determined in view of the Kramers-Kronig transformation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Bulk structure and morphology characteristics The XRD pattern obtained as a result of autoclaving titanium isopropoxide with triblock copolymer F127 and NaOH (10M) at 100°C followed by annealing at 400°C (titanateF127) indicates polymorphs structure consisting mainly of Na2Ti3O7; with reflections located at 2θ=9.8°(111), 16.9°(101), 30.9°(003), 31.8°(202), 38.2°(013), 45.5°(104) and 48.0°(020). Additionally, a minor amount of the rutile phase; with reflections at 2θ=27.5°(101) and 56.2°(002) were also shown together with titanium metal evidenced by small reflections at 2θ=35° and 40.5°, the origin of which requires further investigation. Incorporating Ag within the above system and calcining at 400°C (Ag-titanateF127) exhibits the existence of the same peaks, with some modification and most importantly enhancement of the peak around 2θ=10° proposing the inclusion of Ag nano-crystallize into the titanate structure. The peaks related to titanium metal suffer a marked decrease in intensity, whereas those of titanate and rutile TiO2; specifically that associated with the (110) lattice spacing, indicate a small decrease. Encapsulation of Ag metal inside titanate structure was traced via noticing an increase in intensity of the peaks at 2θ=38.2° and 45.5° correlated to (111) and (200) lattice spacings (JCPDS No. 04-0783), superimposing those of (013) and (104) correspond to titanates. A small peak at 2θ=64.5° correlated to (220) of Ag due to face centered cubic is also evident. In the case of the XRD pattern of the sample derived from using the CTAB template (titanateCTAB), a shapely presence of titanate structure via the existence of broad peaks at 2θ=33.6°(302), 48.0°(020) and 62.8°(204) was depicted together with a characteristic peak at 2θ=12.9°, implying layer contraction compared to titanateF127. This indicates that the triblock copolymer template not only assisted the evolution of the titanate structure, but also widened the distances between layers compared to that of the CTAB surfactant, which obscured any peaks correlated to titanium metal and TiO2 rutile moieties. Ag insertion in this sample (Ag-titanateCTAB) stimulates the existence of a peak at 2θ=9.8° compared to 12.9°; in titanates, suggesting layer expansion of the former due to Ag incorporation, the presence of which has also been established via the reflections at 2θ=38.2° (111) and 45.5°(200). In this sample, the broad peak assigned for rutile of the lattice plane (110) was strongly retained following Ag incorporation (Fig. 1 ). To gain a deeper insight into the morphology of our synthesized catalysts, TEM measurements were performed. Fig. 2 a explores the TEM image of titanates derived from F127 that display a well-exfoliated and crumpled nanosheets morphology. The SAED pattern of this sample (Fig. 2a-inset) clarifies the existence of the titanate structure via the presence of the lattice planes (100), (104), (020) and (220). Fig. 2b illustrates the TEM image of Ag titanates derived from F127 in which a successful distribution of Ag on titanate nanosheets can be clearly seen. The homogeneously distributed Ag crystallites of spherical shape indicate an average diameter around 2–3nm. The inset Figure of SAED indicates lattice spacings (100), (104), (020) and (111) corresponding in sequence to titanates and Ag nanocrystallites. This establishes the deposition of Ag nanocrystallites on titanate nanosheets. Fig. 2c shows the TEM image and the corresponding SAED (inset Fig. 2c) of titanates synthesized using the CTAB template. The as-prepared titanates; as established from the SAED pattern, showed near-spherical shapes of average diameter of 25–40nm and demonstrated a slight agglomeration. After Ag incorporation, a dense number of overlaying titanates nanosheets was observed in the TEM image (Fig. 2d). It was hardly defining Ag nanoparticles in this particular sample, although the lattice fringe spacing of (111) related to Ag was detailed in the diffused ring electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2d-inset). This indeed gives a hint about the amorphous structure of this CTAB based sample; as emphasized previously via the XRD results, and the dense population of the nanosheets through which it obscured the clear vision of Ag nanoparticles. 3.2 Textural properties The textural properties of the synthesized titanates and their supported Ag counterparts were analyzed from their respective nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 3 ) and pore size distribution curves (Fig. 3-inset). Table 1 summarizes the BET surface area, pore volume and pore size values calculated for the materials. All the isotherms were found to be type IV isotherms with larger hysteresis loops and surface areas for titanates synthesized from F127; provoking greater mesoporosity compared to CTAB (Table 1). Surprisingly, Ag-titanatesF127 exhibited a higher SBET value (51.1m2/g) exceeding that of Ag free titanate127 (40.2m2/g) probably because Ag incorporation stimulated the existence of micropores as evidenced from the hysteresis loop that closes at p/po =0.44 vs. p/po =0.5 for titanateF127. A further proof for Ag incorporation inside titanateF127 sheets was evidenced via increasing the pore radius as well as decreasing the pore volume values of Ag-titanateF127 compared to their counterpart values for Ag free titanateF127. This comprehends the enforcement of Ag nanoparticles inside the nanosheets. A similar behavior was also seen for Ag-titanatesCTAB that depicted higher SBET and pore radius values beyond those of titanateCTAB, but indeed far from those of titanateF127 and Ag-titanateF127. Pore size distribution (PSD) curves confirmed that Ag incorporation in case of titanateF127 has affected the pore apertures to give 5 modal types of pores at 10, 20, 25, 30 and 40Å in front of 12, 20, 30 and 50Å in titanateF127. Besides, the former has extended its mesoporous size to beyond 160Å against 110Å for the latter. Concerning the pore size distributions of titanateCTAB and Ag-titanatesCTAB, the difference is not that significant since they both show micropore type of pores, giving a probability about the non-complete combustion of the template in these samples. Indeed, decreasing the hysteresis loop area in Ag-titanatesCTAB than titanatesCTAB advocates the possible localization of Ag inside the titanate nanosheets and to deposition of the non-decomposed carbons of the CTAB template. 3.3 Vibrational spectroscopy Raman spectra have been obtained for the synthesized samples and are presented in Fig. 4 a. The spectrum of titanateF127 has bands at 73, 114, 279, 441, 631, 690–750 and 885cm−1. According to previous works, the bands at about 73 and 114cm−1 are attributed to the rutile TiO2 modes [27]. The bands at about 279, 441, 631and 690–750cm−1 are assigned to Ti-O-Ti stretching vibration in edge-shared TiO6 unit [27] where the band at 885cm−1 represents the stretching vibration of short Ti-O bonds in distorted TiO6 units. This finding is in agreement with the XRD results, which showed that this sample is composed of TiO2 rutile phase as well as the titanate phase. The Ag-titanateF127 spectrum showed diminishing of the modes related to rutile TiO2 (114sh) as well as those correlated to titanate skeleton (276, 441cm−1) besides, shifting the band at 885cm−1; seen in titanateF127, into 908cm−1. The last high energy mode (908cm−1) and changes shown in the low energy mode (rutile–71cm−1) are affected by the Ag incorporation and certainly associated with the Ag involvement. Titanates derived from CTAB showed bands typical to those exhibited by titanatesF127 with slight variation including loss of that at 71cm−1 and exposing a new band at ∼ 791cm−1. The broad peak at 280cm−1 assigned to the characteristic phonon mode of titanate nanotube structures [28] and the peak at 438cm−1; belonging to the Ti–O bending vibration involving six coordinated titanium atoms and three coordinated oxygen atoms in layered titanates, [29] were more intense than those belong to titanateF127. In Ag-titanateCTAB sample, bands at 75, 116, 283, 441, 708 and 913cm−1 were observed to conquer vanishing of 649 and 791cm−1 bands and shifting that of 889cm−1; in titanateCTAB, into 913cm−1. This demonstrates Ag incorporated into titanateCTAB has taken place with a change in Ti–O–H vibration to form the Ti-O-Ag mode. Retaining the band at 75cm−1 assigned to rutile TiO2 following Ag incorporation in this sample was in accordance the XRD results. In concordance with XRD and texturing data, the interaction between titanate and Ag to form Ti-O-Ag was stronger in the sample synthesized from CTAB (913cm−1) than that produced from F127 (908cm−1). Infrared spectra were recorded on the Ag-substituted as well as Ag free titanate nanostructures and are shown in Fig. 4b. It is believed that the broad peak at about 3200–3450cm−1 and the peak at 1637cm−1 correspond to surface-adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups in titanateF127. The other band at 883cm−1 and those in the 500–650cm−1 margin (532, 638cm−1) can be assigned to the Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti skeletal frequency modes, respectively. The depicted small peak positioned at 1784cm−1 together with the intense one at 1448cm−1 are indicative of the presence of residual amounts of the polymeric F127. Ag incorporation in titanateF127 influenced severely the band seen at 3427cm−1 shifting it to 3300cm−1, which in addition gained broadness. The intensity of the bending vibration seen at 1637cm−1 was also enhanced. This indicates an increase of surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water molecules in the interlayer spacing of titanate nanosheets during Ag incorporation. Vanishing the band at 1784cm−1 as well as decreasing the intensity of the 1448cm−1 band; assigned to CC [30], is depicted whereas bands associated with Ti-O-Ti are increased. The titanate sample derived from CTAB presents broad bands at 3200 and 2500cm−1 and possesses typical bands as those seen in titanateF127; at 1637, 1448, 883 and 638cm−1, with loss of that at 532cm−1. Ag/titanateCTAB has stimulated the existence of new bands at 1539, 1336 and 1065cm−1 with diminishing that at 1447cm−1. It also causes shifting the OH stretching band exhibited at 3200cm−1 into 3300cm−1 together with nearly total loss of the hydrogen bonded band exhibited at 2500cm−1. This indicated that Ag incorporation took over the hydrogen bonded OH groups and rather formed a strong bond with a titanate (Ti-O-Ag) feature present at 1065cm−1. The profile of CTAB assisted titanate structure suggests a more complex hydrogen bonded environment. However, exceeding the pore radius and volume values of the samples derived from F127 than that with CTAB suggests that the latters behavior is correlated to adsorbed water molecules rather than enlargement of the interlayer spacing; as established via surface textural data. The emergence of bands at 1539 and 1336cm−1 ascribed to CTAB residues; not completely decomposed, as a result of Ag insertion (Ag-titanateCTAB) highlights the deposition of organic moieties inside nanosheets and thus blocking some pores. A dramatic decrease in SBET and Vp values of this particular sample is comparatively attained (Table 1). It has been demonstrated that interlayer distances between nanosheets can be tuned to be larger when F127 triblock copolymer is used. 3.4 Diffuse reflectance UV−visible spectroscopy Fig. 5 presents the optical absorption spectra of titanateF127, Ag-titanateF127, titanateCTAB and Ag-titanateCTAB samples. The spectrum of titanateF127 shows a typical Na2Ti3O7 band at 271nm together with a broad band at 461nm assigned to the rutile TiO2 phase [26,30]. However, the red shift of the latter band compared to other synthesized rutiles (400–435nm) is probably correlated to TiO2 aggregation. Ag incorporation affects the spectral shape and rather enhanced the intensity towards visible light and exposes bands at 288nm and 400nm and rather stimulates the existence of a surface Plasmon resonance band (SPR) at 400nm [31]. The estimated value of the band gap of titanateF127 was 1.85eV (inset) whereas that of Ag-titanteF127 assigned a value of 2.05eV. The absorption spectra of CTAB derived samples were broader and possessed higher shifts in the absorption toward visible light than those of the F127 synthesized samples. In addition, Ag-titanateCTAB sample did not exhibit SPR band proposing that stacking of several nanosheets affected the electronic properties of the titanate containing Ag moieties; as confirmed via TEM images. Accordingly, strong interaction between different layers is likely to exist in the case of multilayered titanate nanosheets in case of CTAB originated samples and thus obscured the SPR of Ag nanocrystallites. Shifting the band seen at 461nm in titanateF127 to 550nm in the CTAB assisted samples; irrespective of Ag involvement, could be due to the high refractive index of titanates and TiO2 synthesized from CTAB i.e. their aggregations. This indeed raises the possibility of electron adoption via such defect sites. Contrarily, shifting the titanate band at 285nm; seen in titanateCTAB, to 262nm in Ag-titanateCTAB explains the expected light harvesting in the UV region and the contribution of Ag particles to the scattering enhancement in the near-UV region [32]. The band gap of titanateCTAB was estimated at 1.9eV whereas that of Ag-titanateCTAB indicated lower value comprised of 1.8eV. 3.5 Electro-oxidation of methanol The electrochemical response of the titanatesF127 electrode shown in Fig. 6 a; recorded in 0.5M H2SO4 − 0.6M CH3OH aqueous mixture, exhibits one anodic peak at 0.49V with current density equal 0.434mAcm−2. This peak is correlated to methanol oxidation; in agreement with recent work of ours [26,30], and rather confirmed via the nonattendance of any peaks around the mentioned potential in the absence of CH3OH (Fig. 6b). However, the involved irreversibility could be due to successive chemical reactions such as isomerization, dissociation (association) and to the conductivity decrease [33]. The Ag/titanatesF127 electrode presents a drastic increase in the current density during the anodic sweep and gives a current equal 0.506mAcm−2 exceeding that of Ag free titanatesF127; by 1.2 times, and at a lower negative potential (0.192V). This indeed reflects the facile oxidation of methanol on Ag incorporated titanatesF127 rather than on the Ag free sample. This assignment was in agreement with the work of Zhen-Bo Wang et al. synthesized Pt supported on sodium titanate/titania composite nanotubes/nanorods via a hydrothermal method [34] and reported a methanol oxidation peak around the same potential. This system exhibits a methanol oxidation current density comparable to ours, and both exceeded that delivered by Pt/C (0.03mVcm−2). This sample also exhibits a reverse peak at −0.2V lower than that exerted on titanatesF127 at 0.1V (Fig. 6b); in the absence of methanol, and thus ascribed to either H2 adsorbed on Ag and/or to the removal of the incompletely oxidized carbonaceous species formed in the forward sweep on the electrode surface [26,30,34]. The cyclic voltammetry curves of Ag/titanateF127 obtained for the 4 cycles (Fig. 6C) indicate small changes toward higher potential for the forward peak. However, the current densities increase with cycles number, implying the electrode stability. Furthermore, the CO oxidation peak located at ∼1.3V was tremendously decreased with the fourth cycle points to decreased the electrode poisoning. On the other hand, titanatesCTAB electrode exhibits one major peak in the sweep potential range from −0.8 to −0.2V (inset in Fig. 6A), ascribed to H2 adsorption-desorption and acquires high current density equal 4.23mAcm−2. No methanol oxidation peak was depicted in this sample unlike that seen in titanatesF127. On the other hand, Ag/titanateCTAB exhibits an anodic potential at 0.175V with a current density of 0.364mAcm−2 and another one at −0.2V with a current density equal 0.25mAcm−2. The former peak is certainly attributed to methanol oxidation since it’s never seen in Ag free titanatesCTAB (Fig. 6B), where as the latter is typical of that seen in Ag/titanatesF127. Exhibiting the onset potential for methanol oxidation on Ag/titanatesCTAB at a lower value than that on Ag/titanatesF127 admits the facile electro-oxidation on the former comparatively, probably via CH bond breakage and subsequent removal of intermediates by oxidation with Ti-OHads [35,36]. Indeed, the Ag/titanatesF127 electrode has a higher current density, which is approximately 1.4 times that of Ag/titanatesCTAB electrode. This is indeed correlated to the effective utilization and dispersion of Ag nanoparticles and to their electronic effect with titanateF127. Accordingly, the electrochemical active surface area (EASA) is calculated according to the formula EASA=QH/(Qr.[Ag]), where [Ag] is the Ag loading in the electrode (mg/cm2) and Qr is a constant representing charges essential to oxidize a monolayer of H2 on Ag. Thus, the measured electrochemical active surface areas of Ag/titanatesCTAB and Ag/titanatesF127 indicate values comprised of 3.0m2 g−1 and 20.2m2 g−1, respectively. Approximately 40% of the BET surface area of Ag containing samples (Table 1) is active under the synthesized conditions. This reflects the ability of Ag/titanatesF127 to obviate the poisonous intermediates as well as low the charge transfer resistance. The decrease in activity of Ag/titanatesCTAB is probably due to lower surface area as well as Ag nanoparticles trapped between the dense sheets of titanates; as emphasized via the TEM image, and thus did not presenting SPR peak unlike Ag incorporated titanatesF127. Accordingly, an increase in the electronic conductivity of Ag/titanatesF127 is expected to contribute to the collected current compared to Ag/titanatesCTAB. This demonstrated that although Ag/titanatesCTAB has indicated strong metal–support interaction, even higher than Ag/titanatesF127, the exhibited decrease in surface area and the comprehensive diminish in the active sites affected the activity. The micropore structure created in Ag/titanatesCTAB as a result of depositing residual carbons via the non-complete degradation of CTAB obstructs the free diffusion of the liquid fuel into the pores. As a consequence, the exhibited diminish in the pore volume value to reach 4.5 times lower than that of Ag/titanatesF127 retarded the efficient methanol adsorption and the consequences thereof concerning proper oxidation. Also, the amorphous structure exhibited for titanateCTAB cannot fully utilize Ag nanoparticles and thus restricts the accessibility of CH3OH and as a result increases the transfer resistance of both intermediates and products. Since the forward peak is generally regarded as methanol oxidation on non-poisoned catalysts, the calculated mass current densities were 285 and 195mAg−1 Ag for Ag/titanatesF127 and Ag/titanatesCTAB, respectively. The jf/jb ratio of Ag/titanatesF127 is also higher than that of Ag/titanatesCTAB. This indicates that the former catalyst has a better tolerance to intermediates than the latter. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves at a scan rate of 10mVs−1have been employed to further study the Ag containing catalysts in the mixture solution of 0.5M H2SO4 and 0.6M CH3OH, as shown in Fig. 7 a. Negative shifting of the onset potential of Ag/titanatesF127 is clearly observed, demonstrating that the electro-oxidation more readily occurs on Ag/titanatesF127 than that on Ag/titanatesCTAB. This negative shift also demonstrates the improvement of the reaction kinetics due to the synergistic effect of the interaction between Ag and titanate F127 [26]. Nevertheless, the reverse is attained in the CV potential curves. This reflects that the small variation in the potential is not effective as such, implying the importance of some other parameters including surface texturing and morphological factors. In addition, the peak current densities observed are in agreement with the CV results. Therefore, these quasi-steady-state polarization curves provide evidences that the composite structure of Ag/titanatesF127 can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity towards methanol oxidation and such rapid process is often characteristic of the reversible electron transfer reaction. As a consequence of the visible light absorptivity; indicated in the UV–vis results, LSV curves of Ag/titanates were investigated under visible light illumination in the mixture and at the same scan rate of 10mVs−1 (inset in Fig. 7a). The observed results showed that methanol oxidation current densities were enhanced into 2mAcm−2 for Ag/titanatesF127 and 0.9mAcm−2 for Ag/titanatesCTAB throughout all the entire potential range. These extra current densities derived from the photoelectrochemical oxidation of methanol are indeed initiated by the photogenerated electron-hole pairs excited by the visible light illumination at Ag-titanate interfaces. The photocurrent density value of Ag/titanatesF127 exceeded those of Pt/TiO2-carbon (1.0mAcm−2), Pt-TiO2NTs/RGO (1.36mAcm−2), and aminosilicate sol-gel stabilized ZnO-Ag (4μAcm−2) [37–39]. This reflects that the synergistic effect between Ag and titanate in enhancing the charge transfer capabilities surpasses those of Pt containing catalysts towards methanol oxidation. As expected, electrons can jump into the conduction band of titanate leaving behind holes in the valence band, under visible illumination. Thus, the ordered titanate especially the one derived from F127; as emphasized from XRD, TEM and surface texturing, has not only worked as a support for homogeneously distributed Ag but also acted as an additional photo-induced catalyst for methanol oxidation; as confirmed from CVs and LSV results. Enhancing the current density of Ag/titanateF127 under visible irradiation to 4 times that in the dark acknowledges the role played by Ag as an electron sink. This certainly prohibits the electron-hole recombination and thus promoted the methanol oxidation photoactivity. Increasing the electron density of surface Ag; amplified via electron transfer from titanatesF127 as a result of the formed interface between them, weakens oxygen containing intermediates including CO (as depicted in Fig. 6C). This was in accord with the Pd/WC system while methanol oxidation [39]. One cannot neglect the role that could be played by deposited carbons inside the pore; as IR and surface texturing confirmed, in delaying charge recombination since it's expected to work as an electron trap. Consequently, the photo-induced holes and Ag catalyze CH3OH oxidation to generate CO2 and water. The reaction mechanism in the electro-oxidation of methanol in acidic media can be suggested as follows in conjunction with some interrelated literatures [40,41]. (1) Ag+OH− =Ag(OH)ads +e− (2) Ag+CH3OH=Ag(CH3OH)ads (3) Ag(CH3OH)ads +3OH− =Ag(CHO)ads +3H2O +3 e− (4) Ag(CHO)ads +Ag (OH)ads =Ag −HCOOH+Ag (5) Ag(CHO)ads +Ti- OH=Ag-HCOOH+Ag+Ti As confirmed from IR and Raman spectroscopies, the dissociative adsorption of water molecules on Ag nanoparticles can create Ag-(OH)ads in conjunction with those generated from TiO2-(OH)ads. On the other hand, free Ag can dehydrogenate CH3OH leading to the formation of CO containing moieties named Ag(CHO)ads that can readily be oxidized via Ag (OH)ads and/or Ti- OH to finally regenerate the active sites of Ag. To confirm the long term performance of titanates and Ag/titanates catalysts for methanol oxidation under dark conditions, a chronoamperometry test at 0.2V versus MSE was conducted for a period of 1000s. Fig. 7 b shows the chronoamperometry curves for all the catalysts in 0.5M H2SO4 −0.6 M CH3OH solution. All the catalysts show rapid current density decay within the first few minutes, followed by a fairly constant current density for a long time. Obviously, the ultimate steady current density of the Ag/titanatesF127 electrode is larger than that on the Ag/titanatesCTAB electrode. This reflects lowering the electrochemical resistance of Ag/titanatesF127 while CH3OH oxidation. The adsorption of catalyst surfaces with COad species was mainly the one responsible for decaying the current density [42]. However, COad species could be more effectively oxidized and removed by the Ag NPs on Ag/titanatesF127 than those on the rest of the electrodes (Fig. 6C). This is mainly due to the well distribution of Ag nanoparticle of small sizes (2–3nm) within the highly arranged widened nanosheets of titanatesF127, and thus performs a better catalytic effect with higher stability and durability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for measuring the charge transfer resistance to gain information concerning the transport of ions and electrons and the effectiveness of the catalysts for methanol electro-oxidation. The Nyquist plot of all synthesized catalysts for methanol electrooxidation is shown in Fig. 8 . This Figure indicates lowering of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the working electrode and the electrolyte interface in the order: Ag/titanatesF127 <Ag/titanatesCTAB < titanatesF127 <itanatesCTAB. The semicircle sizes, which directly reflect the strength of the electrochemical resistance, indicate similar regularity as in CV curves. Mostly, the semicircle diameter is correlated to the electron transfer resistance, which is apparently affected by the surface modification of the electrode [42,43]. This Fig. also shows slopes along the imaginary axis at low-frequency region proposing ionic conductivity as well. This demonstrates that the composite architectural arrangement formed by the Ag and titanatesF127 can enhance the conductivity of the electrode owing to its faster interfacial charge carrier transfer. This is based on increasing the specific surface area of the nanosheets that increases the Ag (2–3nm) dispersion in comparison with the irregular morphology of the titanates derived from CTAB. Usually, conductivity and surface activity are the two main important factors for imparting methanol oxidation activity for an electrode, among many other factors [42,43]. The Ag/titanatesF127 structure not only provides a larger interface and forms pores and channels; for the liquid fuel to diffuse into the inside and the gaseous product (CO2) to escape from the catalyst surface more easily, but also retains faster electron-transfer speed at the interface between liquid and electrode. Therefore, the Ag/titanatesF127 electrode exhibits excellent performance in electrooxidation of methanol in acidic media. The resistance obtained from the analysis of EIS spectra by using Kramers-Kronig software based on an equivalent electric circuit and the simulated results is shown as an inset in Fig. 8. The electrochemical impedance (EIS) of all nanomaterials data is fitted with an equivalent circuit, which consists of a bulk solution resistance (Rs), a charge-transfer resistance (Rct), a pseudocapacitive element (C) from the redox process of Ag+/Ag and Warburg resistance (W) expected to result from the ion diffusion. This inset circuit of Ag/titanatesF127 shows the proximity of the circuit with the original data obtained via CVs. The typical circuit of Ag/titanatesF127 indicates charge transfer resistance of 550Ω that was lower than Ag/titanatesCTAB (1000Ω), titanatesF127 (1150Ω) and titanatesCTAB (1350Ω); consistent with the cyclic voltammogram results. This clearly indicates that Ag/titanatesF127 provides easier access (less resistance) for intercalation and deintercalation of charges compared to rest of the electrodes and the Ag addition improves the electronic conductivity of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanosheets. 4 Conclusion A facile fabrication of Ag incorporated titanates based on employing surfactant templates has shown outstanding properties as a (photo)-electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation especially for the material derived from pluronic F127. Based on the characterization results, Ag/titanateF127 showed the highest electrochemical surface area and pore volume values; compared to Ag/titanateCTAB, with excellent synergistic effect and distribution of Ag within the titanate nanosheets. This indeed simulated the ease diffusion of CH3OH inside the pores to ultimately liberate the CO2 product. Also, the electron transfer between dispersed Ag nanoparticles and titanateF127 together with hindering charge (e−-h+) recombination enhanced the photo-electrocatalytic activity to be the highest. Contrarily, Ag/titanateCTAB that suffered a comprehensive decrease in pore volume, disappearance of the SPR band; unlike Ag/titanateF127, and its amorphous nature decreased the charge transfer (conductivity) and thus the CH3OH oxidation activity. This study proved that Ag/titanateF127 has a great potential for application for light assisted methanol fuel cells and is worthy of further investigation. References [1] K.P. Abhilasha P.C.

        "dc:description": "Silver nanoparticles successfully incorporated in titanate nanosheets and synthesized hydrothermally via employing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and triblock copolymer (pluronic F127) assisted templates were thoroughly characterized using transmission electron microscopy-selected area electron diffraction (TEM-SAED), X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV/visible absorption spectroscopy, N2 sorptiometry, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The dispersed Ag nanoparticles of uniform size (2–3nm) were found to contact intimately with titanateF127 nanosheets to show superior crystallinity, wider layer distances and higher surface area and pore volume (SBET =51.1m2 g−1,Vp =0.081cm3g−1) than Ag/titanateCTAB (7.2m2 g−1, 0.02cm3 g−1). This constructed Ag/titanateF127 exhibits markedly improved electrocatalytic (1.4-fold) and photoelectrocatalytic (4.0-fold) activities and stabilities towards methanol oxidation than that of Ag/titanateCTAB; as determined using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The enhanced activity of Ag/titanateF127 was also attributed to electron transfer across the interface potential of the composite Ag-titanateF127 as well as the delay of charge recombination that has been substantiated not only via exposed Ag but also through the non-decomposed carbon template. This enhanced electron transfer and electronic conductivity was established by impedance spectroscopy, and exhibits the maximum obtained photocurrent density (2.0mAcm−2) under visible light illumination (λ>420nm, 88W). The results revealed that the template F127 had a significant effect not only on enhancing the titanate crystallinity and exhibiting a surface plasmon resonance band; unlike Ag/titanateCTAB, but also in acquiring a high pore volume value and widened layers, which all work towards improving the Ag-titanateF127 durability for methanol oxidation.",
