E.ILZAR, Z. SCHAY and E.. GUCZE Institute of Isotopes of tire Hungarian Academy of Sciences. H-1525 Budapest. P_ O_ Box 77 (Hungary) Summary In side Mossbauer studies and simultaneous catalytic reactions of CO + HZ mixtures at 1 and 20 bars pressure to form olefins were carried out on Fe and Fe-Ru bimetallic catalysts prepared by impregnation of Cab-O-Sil with a hexane solution of Fe3(CO)t2 and a mixture of Fe3(CO)~2 and Ru3(CO),2. Under reaction conditions the main component of the Mossbauer spectra (I.S- = 0.0 mm s 1 and O.S. = 0.5 mm s 7l) can be assigned to the reacting species of surface carbon, which can be distinguished from X-carbide which has also formed during the reaction. In the presence of ruthenium, the spectra are very similar to those measured on iron, but a large X-carbide signal with hyperfine splitting cannot be detected. From the kinetic and in situ Mossbauer experiments carried out under different conditions, direct evidence was found for the formation of mobile, reactive carbon which participates in the production of olefins and higher hydrocarbons. It can be transformed either into other types of carbon, one of which is responsible for methane formation, or into that species responsible for catalyst deactivation. A possible mechanism is discussed in this paper. Introduction Many controversial data exist in the literature concerning reactive carbon or carbon-containing species in t'.e Fischer--Tropsch synthesis [1 3] . First, CH2 groups were regarded as responsible for chain lengthening on iron., and later this was supported by 1:R techniques [41 on Ru-containing catalysts. On the contrary, in some cases CO insertion was assumed, relying upon the evidence of the formation of oxygen-containing compounds which cannot be explained by insertion of the carbon formed by dissociation: of CO on the catalyst surface [ 5] . 0304-5102j8210000-0000/502.75 Q Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 206 We have shown previously [6, 7] that the iron-ruthenium catalysts prepared from bimetallic cluster; such as Fe2Ru(CO)12 or fI2FeRu3(CO)13 reveal activity and olefin selectivity that resemble that shown by iron and ruthenium, respectively. Similar results were obtained using a mixture of Fe3(CO)12 and Ru3(CO),2. At that stage, surface intermediates available for chain lengthening were not established, although some indirect evidence has been obtained which points to the importance of surface carbon as a reacting species [8, 9] . Some other works in the literature have dealt with the correlation between the surface carbide phase and selectivity. Formation of different kinds of carbides was studied on Fe supported on silica. The iess stable e-carbide was developed on small particles, whereas on larger particles x-carbide was found after treatment at 620 K [10] . Development of the carbide phase took place only during the first 3 - c hours of the reaction [ 11, 12] and the carbides formed were Lound to be resistant to mild oxidation [12]. Mainly X-carbide [10] .yes produced on iron supported on magnesia. The presence of e-carbide was also detected on alumina and modified alumina [13]. The increase in catalytic activity was in good correlation with formation of the carbide phase [11] . The influence of alloying on the formation of carbides was also studied. Alloying iron with nickel did not result in carbide formation [ 10] but caused a significant modification of the reaction path [ 14] . Alloying iron with ruthenium was also studied during pretreatments of the silica-supported catalysts. A high RuJFe ratio was accompanied by enhanced iron reducibility [ 1 c] , but a low proportion of ruthenium hindered reduction of the iron [16]. The question arises whether or not the formation of stable carbide :nay be considered as evidence of its participation in the formation of higher hydrocarbons. If not, a reactive species may be assumed which is a common intermediate for the chain-lengthening reaction and for surface carbide formation. This may be the reason why the correlation mentioned could be found. In the present work we studied the formation of such a reactive species by in situ Mbssbauer experiments and kinetic investigations in an attempt to distinguish the activated CO or carbon as the reactive species under catalytic reaction conditions. Experimental Apparatus For Mbssbauer studies the cell used was manufacture-d from stainless steel and is detailed elsewhere [17]. The catalyst sample, inserted horizontally. can be heated up to 770 K and the spectrum taken at temperatures ranging between 80 and 770 K. The cell can be evacuated and catalyst samples can be treated with helium, hydrogen and a mixture of fIZ + CO 207 as reactant gas. Gas mixtures were introduced into the sample directly, and the effluent was analysed by a Hewlett Packard Model 427 gas chromatograph. When the reaction stabilized, the Mossbauer spectrum was taken at the reaction temperature followed by measurements at room temperature and at 80 K. Mossbauer spectra were obtained in a constant acceleration mode by a KFKI Mossbauer spectrometer connected to a KFKI multichannel analyser- Evaluation of spectra was performed by a SIRIUS 40 programme set developed in KFKI [181 . A single line S'CO Cr source was used and all isomer shift (I.S.) values were related to metallic iron For separate kinetic measurements a continuous flow stainless steel reactor was used and connected to a gas chromatograph, Hewlett Packard Model 427. One of the FIDs was used to detect total hydrocarbon products, and the second was connected to a 3 m column filled with n-octane on Porasil C. With this arrangement the hydrocarbon conversion was proportional to the FIss signal, and after calibration the reaction conversion could be calculated. In all cases the reactor worked in differential regime in a conversion range below 190. Catalysts The iron-ruthenium catalyst was prepared by decomposition of ironand ruthenium carbonyl clusters deposited from a hexane solution containing a mixture of Fe3(CO) 12 and Ru3(CO) `7 or' Cab-O-Sil'9 evacuated at 770 K overnight. For Mossbauer measurements, the catalyst was prepared in the same way except that the starting material, Fe3(CO)1i, was enriched with 88% 5'Fe- Results Mdssbauer measurements Mossbauer spectroscopic measurements were carried out under reaction conditions. For the sake of better comparison, not only was iron-ruthenium bimetallic catalyst studied, but the catalfst prepared from pure Fe3(CO),Z was also investigated. Supported iron carbonyls were decomposed in vacuum and hydrogen. At 570 K in both cases oxidized species were detected to some extent with I.S. values of about 0.18 mm s ' (^-607o) and 1.0 - 1.1 mm s ` (^-357o) as shown in Fig. la and b. The vacuum-treated sample measured at 80 K had no magnetic hyperfine structure; i.S. of the main peaks decreased about 0.1 mm s-1 (Fig. 1a). Hydrogen-treated samples gave different spectra: Fe 2% Fe3+ and ^-139 metallic Fe with magnetic splitting were detected at 80 K (Fig. 16). Considerable oxidation of Fez' component took place at room temperature and the relative area of the magnetically split component decreased to 6 - 890. Oxidation occurred to a smaller extent also on the 'The total metal load amounted to 1 wt.% measured by the XRF methO. 570 K JAI I E9 K lal I i Icl ! ~s -1 0 1 2 -6 -5 -4 -3 -7 -1 0 1 7 3 & ;~\"\"6 Fig. 1.

Under reaction conditions in the GO + H2 mixture a quadrupole doublet (LS_: 0.0 and Q.S.: 0.41 - 0.49 mm s 1) was detected in every case, with or without the pi-esence of additional broad lines (LS.: 0.14 - 0.20 and a less intense LS.: 1.44 - 1.60 mm s') as shown in Fig. Ic. Shapes of the spectra were quite independent of whether the preceding treatments occurred in hydrogen or in vacuum. After cooling to 80 K, the spectra showed mainly Fe\"' components (T.S.: 1.17, Q.S.: 2.15 - 2.20 mm s ') and some magnetically split X-iron carbide (-H,: 184 and 222 kOe). On measuring at room temperature, oxidation of Fee` to Fe 3+ was detected; the ratio of the carbide phase did not change. The proportion of the carbide phase increased during the treatments in CO = I32. After 21 h reaction, one third of the iron was present in the form of magnetic carbide, and during the subseQuent 43 h treatment its proportion increased to about 70% (Fig. 2). In order to elucidate the nature of the doublet characterized by LS. _ 0 and Q.S. = 0_4q mm s', iron carbides were also prepared without Cab-OSil\" support under reaction conditions on the beryllium window of the sample holder.

The presence of a high temperature doublet with LS- values of 0.0 mm s 7l does not involve the presence of carbides having a magnetic hyperfine structure 2t 80 K.

After treating this sample in vacuum at 570 K, a doublet was recorded at 15G K with smaller Q.S. values (I.S.: 1.13 mm s ', Q.S.: 1.84 mm s '). After hydrogen treatment again at 570 K, the initial parameters of Fee` were restored (I.S.: 1.17, Q.S.: 2.14) ih addition to 14% magnetically split Fe and 23% Fe\" component (I-S.: 0.57, Q.S.: 1.12) at 80 K. Alloying iron with small amounts of ruthenium (about one ruthenium atom to five iron atoms) had significant influence on the Mossbauer spectrum. The shapes of the spectra recorded at 570 K were similar to those obtained in the case of iron - a slight increase in the value oquadrupole splitting was observed. (I.S.: 0.0, Q.S.: 0.57 mm s 'j. A considerable difference occurred in the spectra at 80 K: large iron carbide particles with magnetic splitting could not be detected. Only Fear (I.S.: 1.17 mm s ', Q.S.: 2.08 mm s ') and 12 - 20ss'o superparamagnetic Fe components were present; considerable oxidation of Fell- was not observed at room temperature (Fig. 4). 240, 207 and 126 kOe) as shown 210 (a) (b) -3 -7 -1 0 1 2 3 4 r7/55 -5 -q -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 ru-l/~ Fig. 3_ 1ldiissbauer spectra of iron carbide without support (a) measured at 570 K, (b) measured at 80 K_ Fig. 4. Mossbauer spectra of iron-ruthenium on Cab-O-SiIO in CO + HZ mixture (a) at 570 K, (bl at 80 K_ Kinetic measurements Previously [6, 7] we have pointed out the differences revealed in the catalytic properties of supported iron- and ruthenium carbonyl clusters decomposed in hydrogen or in helium. Without offering any detailed mechanism, we suggested that the difference could be attributed to the presence of the carbon left on the catalysts after decomposition in helium. For this reason, catalysts are prepared via decomposition up to 770 K either in helium or in hydrogen. The CO + HZ reaction has been studied in two temperature ranges, at ^-500 K and at 600 K. Activity othe catalysts and the temperature dependence are shown in Fig. 5. Ft is obvious that the catalytic activity in the reaction carried out at high temperature (see lines a and b) is always lower, regardless of the mode of decomposition, than that for the reactions started at low temperature (line c). The apparent activation energy in the total conversion of the CO + H-, reaction is the highest for the catalyst decomposed in hydrogen. The finding is similar to that obtained on a bimetallic catalyst prepared from bimetallic clusters [ Z91. Distribution of the love molecular weight products is presented in Table 1. Here it is clearly demonstrated that methane formation is higher on the catalyst prepared in helium, and at the same time the quantity of olefinic products is somewhat less than that obtained on the catalyst decomposed ir: hydrogen (see Table i lines 1 and 2). 211 (s r. -6 -7 .r i aalO L7 l9 713 2. 1 i/7.103 Fig. S_ The plot olog ro ro in mol s-1 gQi us. 1/T_ Catalyst 0.5 wt.% Ru + 0.5 wt. % Fe on Cab-O-SilO_ (a) A: Catalyst prepared in H, up to 770 K stabilized in reaction at T= 600 K; (b) e: Catalyst prepared in He up to 770 K stabilized in reaction at t = 600 K; (ej m: Catalyst prepared in He up io 770 K stabilised in reaction at T= 500 K.

On the other hand, when catalyst is prepared by heating tae carbonyl clusters in helium up io only 570 K, the surface behaviour is different from that obtained previously. 'fable I (line 4) shows that at 500 K the selectivity of C1rI formation is much lower than in the previous case (cf. line 3) and simultaneously more ethylene and propylene are formed. The rates of formation of methane, ethylene and propene are not interconnected, 212 because on increasing the temperature all quantities increased, but methane increased to a lesser extent than ethylene and propene, as shown in Table 2. Upon high temperature treatment of the stabilized catalyst (up to 770 K in He) the activity and selectivity are slightly changed. A more pronounced change can be observed after hydrogen treatment because methane formation decreases drastically and olefin formation is enhanced, as shown, in Table 1 (see lines 5 and 6). When CO coverage on the surface increases at the expense of hydrogen, olefin formation increases as is expected (see Fig. 6), whereas a pressure rise facilitates the formation of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons (see Fig. 7).

In the lowest oxidized state (I.S.: 0.18 mm s ') more than one third of the iron- can be found. This value of the isomer shift also indicates a small interaction -with the support. Spectra of these samples reveal that only small particles were formed, as shown by the low isomer shift (0.1 mm s') of the main component and by the absence of magnetic splitting. This can be attributed to the stabilizing effect of the remaining carbon [71 . Bearing in mind the Fee\"' + H, = Fe + 2HF activation process of hydrogen an alulnina- [ 131 and magnesia- [ 201 supported iron above 470 K, spectra of the samples treated in hydrogen at 570 K are expected to contain more of the component with a low isomer shift. The main component in this case is also at I.S. = 0.19 mm s ', with a lower proportion of the intensity compared to the vacuum-treated sample. The mentioned activation of hydrogen does not seem to be predominant on silica-supported iron.

The smallest isomer shift values were measured on the iron samples treated with a CO + HZ mixture at 570 K. The presence of activated CO or reactive surface carbon is indicated by the appearance of a peak with I.S_ = 0.0 and Q_S_ = 0.4 mm s '. When 3 separate stable carbide phase is also present, the quadrupole splitting increases to 0.55 - 0.68 mm s `. Interaction of the reacting gas mixture with iron has a strong influence on the shape of the spectra recorded under reaction conditions, whereas pretreatments in hydrogen or vacuum have no significant effect. The intensity of other com ponents with I.S. = 0.14 - 0.2 and 1.44 - 1.60 mm s ' was smaller or even vanished in some cases. When the sample treated with the reacting gases was cooled to 80 K, Fee` and different types of carbides were detected- The iron present in the form of Fe2* at low temperature (or at least a part of it) is presumed to belong to that present at high temperature as a doublet with I.S. = 0.0 and Q.S. = 0.4 mm s '. The disappearance of this doublet is likely due to the removal of the carbon species which are the intermediates in the formation of hydrocarbons. After carbon removal, iron is converted into an oxidized form, similar to the Fe-Hi system on magnesia and alumina already mentioned. This Fe2' component possesses high dispersion, as indicated by its subsequent oxidation when resting at roam temperature. Carbides are resistant to this slight oxidation because their relative proportions do not change. The main component on the sample treated with a CO + H, mixture is the magnetically split spectra assigned to x-carbide. The two outer lines correspond to the Fe' and Fe\" sites (H,Fe' _ ? 84 kOe, F\" = 222 kOe), and the inner line to Fe\"' (H. = 110 kOe [ 10] ). The intensity ratio of the measured line is not the same as in the bulk phase (bulk Fe':Fe\":Fe\"' = 2:2:1 [14] ). The intensity of our Fe\"' is greater than the expected valueFurthermore, the Curie temperature of X-carbide is ^-510 K, and for carbide is 650 K [10, 14] _ No magnettc splitting was observed on our samples at 570 K and this also points to the presence of x-carbide- The third evidence is the value of quadrupole splitting of the superparamagnetic component (reported Q.S. are 0_13 and 0_96 mm s ' at 530 K for e- and e'-carbide, respectively [14] ). On the contrary, ou: Q.S. values at 570 K are between 0.4 and 0.55 mm s '. One can argue that the quadrupole doublet measured at 570 K actually belongs to the X-carbide and not to the reacting species, as shown by exper iments of x-carbide deposited on beryllium plate. The strongest argument against this idea is the comparison of Fe/Cab-O-Silo and FeRu/Cab-O-Sil samples treated with the reacting gas mixture. In both cases the doublet with I_S. = 0.0 mir_ s ' and Q_S. = 0.4 mm s -l was detected at 570 K. How ever, the low temperature spectra showed no separate carbide phase formed on the FeRu/Cab-O-Sil sample whereas on the iron sample it appeared. 215 In the former case only Fe\" was present, with 12 - 2096 paramagnetic Fe' component. This also supports the assignation of the high temperature quadrupole doublet to the chemisorbed reacting carbon monoxide or to the reacting carbon species. Broadening of the quadrupole lines, which occurs sometimes, may be a result of the overlapping of the Mossbauer signals obtained from the reacting species and from the stable carbide which appears at low temperature in magnetically split form. Nevertheless, the absence of stable carbide on iron-ruthenium samples can be supported e.g. by XPS measurements on the decomposition of Fe3(CO)l.z and Ru3(CO) l2 samples [8] . From the experiments presented in Fig. 2 we have additional evidence that carbide may not be the reacting species for the CO + H2 reaction. The amount of X-carbide phase increases as the reaction proceeds. However, the activity of catalyst decreases during this period, as indicated by kinetic experiments. Undoubtedly carbide formation increases with time on stream, but it seems that this process parallels the route in which hydrocarbon products are formed. Mechanism From the Mossbauer measurements it becomes clear that: (i) a reactive, or mobile form of surface carbon is formed; (ii) stable carbide is also formed and accumulates as the reaction proceeds. This is in agreement with earlier findings [ li, 12] . Scheme 1 is suggested to incorporate all experimental facts resulting from the kinetics, and does not contradict the picture evidenced by the Mossbauer data.

(C)m can be formed either from the carbonyl ligands of the metal carbonyl cluster when it is decomposed in helium [6, 71 or 'via dissociation of the reactant CO. This latter requires free metallic sites, first for the activation of CO as was demonstrated [S, 2Z] , and then for its dissociation. Clear distinction cannot be made between the two forms of activation of CO; however, indirect evidence shows that dissociation is 216 needed for the reaction. There is no need to comment on the carbidic type of surface carbon, since its formation is clearly indicated by Mdssbauer spectroscopy. In the present work, however, we found an inverse relationship between its concentration and the catalytic activity, which is opposite to earlier findings [ llj . For (C)i we also have only indirect evidence, i.e. when CO is disconnected from the gas stream, only methane is formed, indicating that this type of surface carbon can be found in such a chemical environment which makes it unable to migrate on the surface to form polymers. In the literature, organometallic alialogues have been reported [22 - 24] which show that carbon atoms can be molecularly connected to at least three metal atoms in a rigid frame. If we assume a similar arrangement on the surface, it ca_n be considered a precursor to methane formation; i.e., there is no other way to remove it but in the form of CH,. Moreover, it is farmed from (C)., in a manner parallel to the polymerization, which is indicated by simultaneous increases in the rats of methane and olefin formation as the temperature increases. Correlation between carbide formation and methane selectivity may serve as further evidence that methane is formed by a separate path. It is generally found that on deactivation (increase of carbide content), methane selectivity decreases at the expense of olefin formation. This can be easily understood if we assume that the site requirement for (C)i is higher than that for (C) i.e- if carbide is accumulated on the surface, fewer free metal atorr_s are available for the formation of carbon triple-bonded to three neighbouring metal atoms. However, we must also consider the fact that carbide formation diminishes the hydrogen coverage which, in turn, again decreases methane formation. The increase in olefin formation with the decrease in the H2/CO ratio gives another indication about the role of surface hydrogen (see Fig. 6). Let us turn our attention to how the kinetic results can be interpreted by these three types of intermediates and by their proportions on the surface. When a metal carbonyl cluster is decomposed in helium by heating up to 770 K, the carbon left on the surface is converted into (C)c. Initial activity of this catalyst is, therefore, loweYthan that shown after decomposition in hydrogen (see Table 1, lines 1 and 2), but the steady state activity is reversed (see Fig. 1, curves a and b). A possible explanation is that although (C)m is high on the catalyst decomposed in 112- (C),, is auickly converted into (C)c; thereby activity at steady state in a high temperature reaction becomes lower on this catalyst. However, a higher concentration of (C),. also results in higher rates of surface polymerization, and thus Sole_i is higher on the catalyst decomposed in H2. Methane selectivity on the catalyst produced in He up to 770 K is lower in the high temperature reaction than that displayed in the low temperature reaction. At the same .ime, steady state activity is higher in the latter case. Interpretation can be given in terms o_- the proportion of (C)i and (C),~, i.e. in the high temperature reaction, the (C)i to (C), transformation diminishes the surface coverage of methane precursor, whereas in the low temperature reaction, 217 (C); to (C), is hindered. -Thus, in the latter case the activity is higher (see Fig. 5) arid Sr,e,,aae is also higher (compare lines 2 and 3 in Table 1). Formation of (C)c is also reduced when the catalyst is prepared by decomposition up to 570 K. Here not only :s the rate of reaction higher, but also rate of the olefin formation. The role of empty metallic sites is well demonstrated by the experiments in which the catalyst was first hydrogenated at steady state followed by CO f Hz reaction. Selectivity to olefins increased after this procedure because surface (C), was partly removed by hydrogenation. and thus after this process the coverage of (C)s, increased, thereby enhancing polymerization and olefin formation. At the same tune, this provides indirect evidence that a dissociative form of carbon and not carbon monoxide is needed for the chain propagation. step; carbon monoxide is always present on the surface and is strongly adsorbed, as indicated by its inhibiting effect on the reaction. The role of hydrogen is shown in Fig. 6. Simply by increasing the CO pressure, not only is the CO coverage on the surface raised and thus the amount of (C)R but the hydrogen coverage is also diminished. In this way all the processes involving hydrogenation on the surface are hindered. However, when total pressure is increased (see Fig. 7) both the hydrogenation and the chain propagation steps increase, and thus the distribution of the hydrocarbons formed is shifted to higher molecular weight products.

Lazar Z. Schay L. Guczi Institute of Isotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 77 Hungary In situ Mössbauer studies and simultaneous catalytic reactions of CO + H2 mixtures at 1 and 20 bars pressure to form olefins were carried out on Fe and Fe—Ru bimetallic catalysts prepared by impregnation of Cab-O-Sil® with a hexane solution of Fe3(CO)12 and a mixture of Fe3(CO)12 and Ru3(CO)12. Under reaction conditions the main component of the Mössbauer spectra(I.S. = 0.0 mm s−1 and Q.S. = 0.5 mm s–) can be assigned to the reacting species of surface carbon, which can be distinguished from χ-carbide which has also formed during the reaction. In the presence of ruthenium, the spectra are very similar to those measured on iron, but a large χ-carbide signal with hyperfine splitting cannot be detected. From the kinetic and in situ Mössbauer experiments carried out under different conditions, direct evidence was found for the formation of mobile, reactive carbon which participates in the production of olefins and higher hydrocarbons. It can be transformed either into other types of carbon, one of which is responsible for methane formation, or into that species responsible for catalyst deactivation. A possible mechanism is discussed in this paper. References 1 M.A. Vannice Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. 14 1976 153 2 V. Ponec Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. 18 1978 151 3 M.E.
