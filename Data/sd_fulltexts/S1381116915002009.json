Graphical abstract Palladium metal nanoparticles have been applied to hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols in contaminated water using H2 as a clean and sustainable reductant. However, there are two major challenges to widespread technology adoption which are the activity loss caused by nanoparticle aggregation and the difficulty of nanoparticle recovery. In this study, a synthesis of a core-shell structured catalyst with encapsulated Pd nanoparticles has been given and whose catalytic activity has been tested in hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols under 1atm H2 at room temperature. The catalyst material consists of a nonporous silica core decorated with Pd nanoparticles that are further encapsulated within an ordered mesoporous silica shell. Well-defined mesopores (2.4nm) provide a physical barrier to prevent Pd nanoparticle (∼10nm) movement, aggregation and detachment from the support into water. Compared with some supported Pd catalysts such as Pd/AC and Pd/Al2O3, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 exhibits higher catalytic performance. After 5 times of recycling, catalytic activity of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 reduces slightly and this result confirms the good recyclability of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2. The function of the mesoporous shell, preventing aggregation of active nanoparticles, suggests a promising general strategy of using metal nanoparticle catalysts for water purification and related aqueous-phase applications. Keywords SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanocatalyst Metal nanoparticles HDC reaction 4-CP 1 Introduction Nowadays, the environmental pollution caused by organic wastes has become an un-ignorable issue. With the staggering growth of industrialization, large numbers of organic compounds, such as the aryl chlorides, have been produced and employed. During the application of aryl chlorides severe environmental pollutions have been produced. Among the most harmful organic contaminants, aryl chlorides are considered as hazardous pollutants because of their acute toxicity and strong potential bioaccumulation [1]. Special attentions have been paid to chlorophenols (CPs) for their widespread availability in important industrial processes, such as the production of germicides, algaecides, fungicides, herbicides, dyes, wood protectors and plant growth regulators [2]. So how to deal with pollutions caused by CPs has become increasingly important and has no time to delay. Up to now, many reported traditional methods including thermal combustion, reduction dechlorination [3,4], oxidation dechlorination [5], biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation have been employed in disposing the wastewater containing CPs. Among the treatment methods mentioned above, thermal combustion and chemical oxidation have been largely employed in the treatment of CPs. Although there are some advantages, it must be noticed that these methods cannot decompose 4-CP completely into simple inorganic compounds such as CO2, H2O and HCl. In addition, toxic chlorinated chemicals such as dioxins, phosgene and chlorine could generate in these treatments processes [6]. These accompanied chemicals can result in secondary pollutions and especially do harm to the health of human beings and atmospheric ecosystem. Therefore, removal of these compounds through a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way has attracted many researchers’ attentions. Compared with traditional treatments of 4-CP mentioned above, hydrodechlorination (HDC) possesses some advantages. By using efficient catalysts, the reaction can be run under a mild condition and the energy consumption can be reduced. In addition, it can reduce the formation of by-products and can be suitable for the treatment of a wide range of chlorinated compounds [7]. Both from the economic point of view and for achieving the greatest degradation of 4-CP, catalytic HDC can be considered as an effective and promising method. In the 1960s, the study of HDC of CPs was initiated, however the first comprehensive report of the liquid phase exhaustive HDC of CPs to phenol over Pd/C only appeared in 1992 [8]. From that moment on, the liquid phase catalytic HDC has been studied by many researchers [7,9,10]. Many influence factors of 4-CP HDC have been studied, such as active phase, supports, sources of hydrogen and reaction media [11,12]. By summarizing the experiences of pioneers, the HDC treatment of CPs using noble metal as activity phase and molecular hydrogen as hydrogen source has been proved to be an efficient method [13]. Till now, large numbers of catalysts using metal nanoparticles (NPs) like Pd [12,14–17], Pt [18,19], Rh [20] and Ni [15] as active phases have been researched greatly. Among them, Pd based catalysts show an excellent catalytic activity for the treatment of CPs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. According to the studies of L. Calvo [21] and F. J. Urbanol [22], it seems that HDC may be a structure-sensitive reaction. The effect factors of supports in HDC reactions had been extensively studied. Recent researches have demonstrated that the supports are significant influences on the dispersion and electronic properties of the NPs. Many supports, such as activated carbon (AC) [23–25], Al2O3 [26] or zeolites [27,28] have been employed to prepare catalysts for HDC of 4-CP. The studies show that Al2O3 as support can improve the stability of active species of the catalyst. Nevertheless, this metal oxide support is more sensitive to HCl produced during the HDC process. Compared with Al2O3, AC seems more suitable as a support because of its large surface area and particular physical and chemical properties [13]. However, the strong adsorption properties based on surface area, pore size distribution, and surface composition limit the applications of AC. During the HDC process, bare NPs can be directly connected with the reactant molecules which can accelerate reaction velocity. However, the bare NPs can easily drop off the support and result in a loss of noble metal. This situation can reduce the recycling value and catalytic activity of catalyst. In this study, active phase focuses on Pd NPs because of the excellent catalytic activity of Pd NPs in HDC of 4-CP. Based on the considerations of catalytic activity affected by surface area, large size SiO2 with ∼500nm is used as a core that can make Pd NPs well dispersed. In order to solve the noble metal loss problem, a sandwich-like structure with large size of NPs and small size of pore has been designed in this research and its catalytic performance for HDC of CPs has also been studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Tetraethoxysilane (TOES), Pd(II) acetate, (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium Bromide (CTAB) are purchased from Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. 4-Chlorphenol (4-CP), 2-Chlorphenol (2-CP), 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and concentrated ammonia aqueous solution are purchased from Lanzhou Aihua Chemical Company. NaBH4 is supplied by Sinophrm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Oganic solvents used are of analytical grade and do not require further purification. 2.2 Preparation of SiO2 microsphere The Silica nanospheres is synthesized by a modified Stöber protocol [29]. In a typical synthesis, 2.7mL of TEOS is added dropwise into a mixture solution of 180mL of ethanol, 30mL of concentrated ammonia aqueous solution and 9mL of distilled water by stirring it at room temperature. After additional stirring for 12h, the SiO2 microspheres are collected by centrifugation (8000rpm, 3min) and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Then the collected microspheres are dried at 40°C in a vacuum drying oven over night for further use. 2.3 Preparation of APTES modified SiO2 microsphere 300mg of SiO2 microspheres are added in 30mL of methylbenzene under ultrasonic dispersion for 15min. Then 150mg of APTES is added and refluxed at 90°C for 12h. The modified SiO2 microspheres are collected by centrifugation (8000rpm, 3min) and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Then the collected nanospheres are dried at 40°C in a vacuum drying oven over night for further use. 2.4 Preparation of SiO2/Pd NPs 300mg of APTES modified SiO2 is added in 30mL of distilled water under ultrasonic dispersion for 15min. Then 60mL of Pd acetate acetonitrile solution (2.11mgmL−1) is added under strong stirring for 12h. After this step, 30mL of 0.3M NaBH4 aqueous solution is added in the solution drop by drop. The products are collected by centrifugation (8000rpm, 3min) and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Then the collected nanospheres are dried at 40°C in a vacuum drying oven over night for further use. 2.5 Preparation of SiO2/Pd@mesoporous-SiO2 To grow a mesoporous silica shell on the SiO2@Pd microspheres, the as-made SiO2/Pd nanosphere (300mg) is redispersed in a mixed solution containing CTAB (0.45g, 1.2mmol), distilled water (100mL), concentrated ammonia solution (2.0mL, 28wt%), and ethanol (150mL). The resultant mixed solution is ultrasonic dispersed for 5min and then stirred for 30min to form a uniform dispersion. Subsequently, 0.8mL of TEOS is added drop-wise to the dispersion under continuous stirring. After magnetic stirring for 6h, the product is collected by centrifugation (8000rpm, 3min) and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Finally, the purified microsphere is re-dispersed in 100mL of ethanol and 1mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 24h to remove the template CTAB. The as-prepared catalyst is dried at 40°C in a vacuum drying oven over night. 2.6 General procedures for the hydrodechlorination of CPs HDC experiments are performed in a three-necked jacketed glass reactor connected with hydrogen balloon by a three-way valve. Firstly, a certain quantity/amount of catalyst is placed into the mixed solution of 30mL of solvent (H2O, ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol), 1 mmol of reactant and 1mmol base (Na2CO3, NaAc, triethyl amine, Na2OH). Secondly, use a circulating water vacuum pump to extract the air in the reactor for 5–10s. Then open the three-way valve and make the hydrogen get into reactor. Repeating the gases replacement process three times and starting the clock. The reaction maintains for 2h under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The results of the experiments are analysed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS). 2.7 Reusability experiment The reusability experiments are performed in a centrifuge tube (in order to reduce catalyst losing) with supplied H2. The catalyst is recovered by centrifugation and simple decantation of liquid products. The catalyst is then washed with deionized water and used directly for the next cycle of the reaction without further purification. 2.8 General methods Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are obtained on a Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, USA. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore-size distribution are obtained by measuring N2 adsorption isotherms at 77K with using a TriStar 3020 (Micromeritics). Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra are obtained by a Rigaku D/max-2400 diffractometer with using Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 0°–80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is recorded on a PHI-5702 and the C1S line at 284.6eV is used as the binding energy reference. The reaction conversion is estimated by using GC–MS (P.E. AutoSystem XL). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization Fig.1 shows the FT-IR spectra of the SiO2 sphere and SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanocatalyst. The FTIR bands at 1091cm−1 and 804cm−1, corresponding to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of SiOSi bond in oxygen-silica tetrahedron, respectively. The bands at 461 correspond to SiO stretching. The band at 3420cm−1 shows the large number of SiOH groups which are proved to be advantageous to the modification of APTES on the SiO2 surface by hydrogen bonds. The band at 2923cm−1 corresponds to CH stretching. In the FT-IR spectrum of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2, the band around 3400cm−1 represents the adsorption of OH and NH2 groups. The nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon contents are 0.9%, 1.65%, and 3.92%, which are measured by the elementary analysis, respectively. The FT-IR spectra and elementary analysis results reveal that the APTES is successfully grafted on the surface of SiO2 [30], thus, enabling them to act as robust anchors for metal NPs [31,32]. The synthesis procedures of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanaocatalyst are represented in Scheme 1 and described in detail in the experimental section. TEM and SEM images of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 with 7.0% metal loading which calculated by inductive coupled measurement are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2b shows a typical SEM image of prepared SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 core-shell structured NPs. From Fig. 2a and Fig. 2d, it can be seen that mesoporous SiO2 is capped on the surface of SiO2/Pd and it also can be measured that average diameter of SiO2 core, the thicknesses of m-SiO2 shell and pore size of m-SiO2 shell are about ∼500nm, 100nm and 2.35nm, respectively. From Fig. 2c, it can be clearly seen that the Pd NPs with a dimater of 10nm are located between the SiO2 core and m-SiO2 shell. This core-shell structure matches our original intention. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for the SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 are given in Fig. 3 . According to the IUPAC classification, the curves of as-prepared sample is type IV isotherms with a very sharp capillary condensation step at P/P0 =0.10–0.30 and H4-type hysteresis loop characterizing small-pore mesoporous materials. The pore size of as-prepared catalyst derived from the BJH analysis on the desorption branch is 2.4nm. The calculated BET surface area and pore volume of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 are 560m2 g−1 and 0.34cm3 g−1, respectively. The small-angle and wide-angle XRD patterns of nanaocatalyst are obtained in Fig. 4 . There is an intense characteristic peak at 2θ=2.3°, which corresponds to the plane (211) of mesoporous material. From the Fig. 3b, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 possesses three peaks, which correspond to planes (111), (200), (220) of Pd. Within the approximation of the Scherrer equation, one would expect a FWHM of 2.3° 2theta for the (111) reflection of Pd with an average crystal size of 9.8nm that matches with the particles size of Pd NPs calculated by using TEM images. The electronic state of Pd species on the SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 is measured with XPS. The pattern of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 catalyst is exhibited in Fig. 5 . The Pd3d peaks in XPS spectra show that the binding energy values of 335.8eV and 341.2eV are attributed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of Pd. Because the Pd NPs is encapsulated within an ordered mesoporous silica shell, the intensity of XPS peak of Pd is weak. In addition, no evidence proves the presence of palladium oxide, which indicates that Pd(OAc)2 is completely reduced to Pd NPs. 3.2 HDC of 4-CP The catalytic activity of nanocatalyst is established in the HDC of CPs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The HDC of 4-CP is negligible without catalyst at the same conditions, which shows that the presence of metal NPs is indispensable for high catalytic activity. In some researchers' studies, three products such as phenol, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone are generated in the process of HDC of 4-CP [22]. Compared with the reactant 4-CP, the three products are detected of low toxicity and useful as intermediates in the production of high value-added chemicals. The low selectivity of HDC of 4-CP performs in fixed bed reactor [33,34] or under a high H2 pressure condition [18]. In the study of L. Calvo, the conversion of 93% and the selectivity of 85% are reported by using Pd/C as catalyst and formic acid as hydrogen source in continuous stirred-tank reactor [2] Pd/Al2O3 as HDC catalyst are also studied by E. Diaz [33]. in fixed bed reactor with the conversion of 87% and the selectivity of 62%, respectively [33] However, only high selective product phenol is detected as product and less than 0.1% of CYC is detected after 120min reaction in presente reaction syetem. These differences may be caused by using different reaction systems. Also this result agrees with the study that uses the same reaction system in which phenol as major product is detected [13,32,35–38] The HDC reaction pathway is described as below: H2 adsorbed on the active site of the nanocatalyst is activated in two hydrogen atoms, in which 4-CP is also adsorbed on the surface of the Pd NPs. The CCl bond of 4-CP is attacked by the active hydrogen atoms to form phenol [36]. Simultaneously, in the process of HDC of 4-CP, HCl formes as by-product which can poison catalysts. In order to reduce the inhibition of generated HCl, four kinds of bases have been studied. By comparing the HDC results, it can be easiliy summarized that NaOH is the best choice [36]. With the addition of base, catalyst deactivation is largely governed by HCl solubility/transport and the nature of the basic species in the catalyst matrix have reported higher HDC rates and enhanced catalyst stability [39]. In addtion, organic and inorganc solvent are also tested and water could be consider as the best choice. The results of HDC of 2-CP, 3-CP, 4-CP and 2,4-DCP using SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 catalyst are carried out and exhbited in Table 1 . At the same catalyst dosage (15mg), after 90min of reaction, 4-CP completely convertes and the convertion of 3-CP and 2-CP are 89.4% and 81.6%, respectively. The concentration of H2 can be considered constant since all the reactions are carried out with a high excess H2. Therefore, the reaction follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics: (1) R 4 -CP = d C 4 − C P d t = − r = − k C 4 − C P (2) ∫ c o ' c t 1 c t d c t = − k ∫ 0 t d t (3) ln C t C 0 ' = − k t (4) X t = C t C 0 ' ( 4 ) C 0 ' = C 0 − C 1 (5) ln C t C 0 ' = ln C t C 0 − C 1 = ln X t − ln ( 1 − C 1 C 0 ) = − k t (6) ln X t = − k t + ln ( 1 − C 1 C 0 ) In the practical experiments process, nearly 30s required to make the system stable. So the at the time zero point, some amount of reactant has been converted and the initial concentration changes from C0 to C0′ which make the fitted curve do not cross original point. According to the concentration value related to the reaction time, and the plotted logarithm of 4-CP concentration versus reaction time, the linear fittings are drew in Fig. 6 . The average reaction rate constant per unit mass k′=k/MPd is calculated to be 39.2min−1 g−1. The kinetic reaction rate of HDC catalyzed by Pd/Al2O3, Pd/pillared clays, Pd/MCM-48 catalyst are 3.33min−1 g−1, 7.6min−1 g−1 and 42.9minmin−1 g−1, respectively [18,34,35]. Compared with these Pd based catalysts which had been reported, the catalyst activity of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 is at a middle position. On one hand, the catalyst of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 performs higher than low surface area catalyst Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/pillared clays. On the other hand, catalytic activity of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 is smaller than Pd/MCM-48 catalyst which Pd NPs is bare. This indicates that the m-SiO2 shell can restrain the combination between the reactant molecules and activity phase, which results in the activity reduction of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2. The recoverability and reusability are investigated by the HDC reaction of 4-CP and the results are summarized in Fig. 7 . After 5 times of recycling, the metal loading of catalyst is 6.9% instead of 7.0% and catalytic activity of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 is reduced slightly. These results confirm the good recyclability of the Pd NPs in SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 catalyst. 4 Conclusion In summary, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 core-shell structured nanocatalyst has been synthesised successfully and the catalytic property is investigated in HDC process in which 4-CP is used as target compound under the condition of sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and at atmospheric H2 pressure, fairly mild conditions. According to the characters of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2, large size of Pd NPs are located between SiO2 core and m-SiO2 shell. The SiO2 layer is used as a barrier to prevent the shedding of Pd NPs from support and the small pores in mesoporous SiO2 allow the molecules to pass through. This structure can reduce the metal losing and increase utilization of catalyst. By analysing the HDC result, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanocatalyst shows a good catalytic activity for HDC of 4-CP, with the reaction rate constant per unit mass k′=k/MPd is 39.2min−1 g−1. The SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanocatalyst can be recycled for at least five times in the corresponding reactions without significant deactivation and metal loss. In this study, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 nanocatalyst acts as a relatively mild, economical, and environmental friendly catalyst, and could be regarded as a promising candidate for various Pd based catalytic applications.
