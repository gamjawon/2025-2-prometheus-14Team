It is shown that all tested arylphosphines except P(o-Tol)3 and P(Mes)3 undergo an extensive PC bond cleavage at temperatures higher than 120. As a consequence, vinylic side products are formed with concomitant catalyst deactivation. In the case of triarylphosphines side products originate from reaction intermediates of the type Pdu(PAr3) 2 (Ar) X. These species undergo an aryl-aryl exchange between the palladium center and coordinated phosphine ligands. Subsequent intermolecular phosphine scrambling leads to several isomerized arylpalladium species, all of which couple with n-butyl acrylate to give the corresponding cinnamic ester side products.

Introduction The palladium-catalyzed arylation of olefins with aryl halides according to the general Scheme 1 is a well-established method of carboncarbon bond formation. Because this versatile reaction, discovered by Heck [ 1 ] and Mizoroki [ 2 ] , is tolerant of a wide variety of functional groups on either coupling partner, it has gained * Corresponding author.

However a serious limitation of the Heck reaction is that aryl chlorides are generally unreactive. This inertness is primarily due to the high C-Cl bond energy (Dph-ct=96 kcal/mol at 298 K) in comparison to the more reactive bromo and iodo derivatives (Dph_X=81 and 65 kcal/mol for X=Br and 1, respectively) [4]. Previous vinylation studies with aryl chlorides have resulted in low yields and low catalyst stability [ 5 ] . Recent approaches to solve this problem were reported by Bozell [ 6 ] and Milstein [ 7 ] . Especially com- 134 WA.

Nevertheless, the activation of aryl chlorides remains a challenge in catalysis, because the multi-step synthesis and great air sensitivity of Milstein's ligands are unfavourable for an application beyond laboratory scale. The present paper is to show that the choice and concentration of triarylphosphine ligands have a crucial influence on yield, selectivity and rate of the coupling reaction. Simple triarylphosphines prove to be responsible for undesired side reactions and early catalyst deactivation [ 8 ] . 2. Results The presentation of the experimental results is organized according to the major substrates, namely aryl bromides and aryl chlorides. 2.1. Aryl bromides Early studies with aryl bromides have shown that Heck vinylation reactions strongly depend upon added ligands that keep the catalyst from i \\ JBr + ~C02Bu + N80AC 1 a-d 1, 2 a b c d Y 4-CHO 4-OCH3 H 2-CH3 precipitating as elemental palladium [ 3 ] (a,b). Especially PPh3 and P(o-Tol)3 have been found to form active catalysts with palladium acetate, the commonly used source of palladium [ 3,9 ] . We have investigated the Heck reaction of several aryl bromides with n-butyl acrylate using both conventional catalyst systems Pd(OAc)2+nP(aryl)3 - and isolated Pd complexes. Since inorganic bases proved to be superior to commonly used triethylamine [9] (b), [ 10], reactions were performed with anhydrous NaOAc in NN-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) (Scheme 2). The results presented in Table 1 unfold a strong substituent effect on the reaction rate. Electronwithdrawing groups in the aryl bromide (-M/ -1) support the Heck reaction (`activated arenes'), while electron-donating groups ( + M / + 1) are unfavourable (`deactivated arenes'). Therefore 4-bromobenzaldehyde reacts at significantly lower temperatures (80-120) than 4bromoanisole which requires a minimum temperature of 135. However, all tested aryl bromides la-d of Table 1 are converted regioand stereoselectively into the corresponding Ecinnamic ester products 2a-d. The Z isomers are found only in traces.

Surprisingly, only the catalyst system Pd (OAc) 2 + 4P(oTol) 3 is able to convert deactivated substrates like 4-bromoanisole and 2-bromotoluene quantitatively into the desired Heck products. This remarkable difference in activities - compared with Pd (OAc) 2 + 4PPh3 - inspired us to study the catalyst systems in greater detail. Triphenylphosphine Kinetic studies with the catalyst system Pd(OAc) 2 + 4PPh3 revealed that Heck reactions with deactivated aryl bromides suffer from an extensive PC bond cleavage in the coordinated phosphine. As shown in Fig. 1, Heck coupling between 4-bromoanisole and n-butyl acrylate leads to n-butyl E-cinnamate as the major side product. This transfer of phenyl groups to the olefin is mainly thermal in origin and can be suppressed or fully avoided by lowering the reaction temperature to T_< 120 (e.g. for 4-bromobenzaldehyde). The nature of the aryl bromide influences the extent of this side product formation, too. Activated substrates that are nearly insensitive to ligand degradation form n-butyl cinnamate even at higher temperatures (140) in only minor amounts. In contrast, deactivated aryl bromides (e.g. 4-bromoanisole) favour side product formation, so Heck products could be obtained in only 70% yield. In the case of bromobenzene yields exceed 90% because Heck coupling and side reaction result in the same product. Until now phosphine degradation via PC bond cleavage was explained by oxidative addition to NO species or nucleophilic 1,2-aryl migration in Pd\" complexes [ 11 ] . However, in the present case these mechanisms seem to be of minor importance. We believe that side product formation is attributable to a differing stability of intermediates of the type traps-Pd[P(C6H5)3]2(aryl)X (3, X=Cl, Br). 'H- and 3'P-NMR studies revealed that especially donor-substituted derivatives undergo a facile aryl-aryl exchange between the Pd\" center and coordinated phosphine ligands [ 12] . Subsequent intermolecular phosphine scrambling promotes further isomerization to different phenylpalladium complexes (4a-e), which 136 W.A.

T=140; catalyst: Pd(OAc)Z+4P(C6H5)3 (Pd/P=1/4), concentrations see Table 1. all give the vinylic side product after coupling with added olefin in the presence of a base (Scheme 3) . As shown in Fig. 1, Heck product and side product are formed in parallel reactions with similar initial rates and no induction periods. Because isomerization of donor substituted arylpalladium(II) halides 3 (Y = OCH3, CH3) is operative at temperatures far below the temperature of the Heck reaction, electron-rich aryl halides (4-bromo-, 4-chloroanisole) achieve considerably lower catalytic results. Although aryl halides are readily activated via insertion of Pd(0) into the C-X bond, subsequent rearrangements in the oxidative addition complex give more stable phenylpalladium species, which all lead to n-butyl E-cinnamate as side product (Scheme 3) . The labile constitution of Pd` intermediates 3 is clearly seen in stoichiometric reactions: In the case of electron-donating substituents (Y=OCH3, CH3) 3 yields predominantly coupling products (i.e. cinnamate) derived from triphenylphosphine (cf. Scheme 3) [ 13 ] (b) . The amount of side product correlates with decrease in phosphine concentration (Fig. 1) . Depending on substrate and reaction temperature, a maximum of two phenyl groups per phosphine is cleaved to account for the produced amount of side product. This continuous phosphine decomposition leads to a gradual subcoordination of the metal species, ultimately accelerating palladium precipitation with concomitant loss of activity. Triphenylphosphine oxide is found right from the beginning in all catalytic runs with Pd (OAc) 2 + 4PPh3 (3 t P-NMR, GLCQ. The concentration remains approximately constant during the course of reaction (Fig. 1) . It should now be generally accepted that PPh3 not only is a ligand but also acts as a reducing agent for Pd(OAc)2 [ 13 ] . However, triphenylphosphine oxide stabilizes the zerovalent Pd catalyst only insufficiently (early metal precipitation at 100 in reaction with la, Scheme 2). The palladium complexes Pd(PPh3)4 and Pd(PPh3)Z(C6H4 p-CHO)Br display very simi lar characteristics in catalysis (PC bond cleavage, kinetics, 31P-NMR spectra). The concentration vs. time diagrams are almost identical to those obtained with Pd (OAc) 2 + 4PPh3. Especially W.A.

Formation of side products induced by isomerization of arylpalladium(II) intermediates (PC bond cleavage). Pd (PPh3) 4 and the mixture Pd (OAc) Z / 4PPh3 proved to be equivalent catalyst systems for the studied type of reaction [ 13 ] (b ) . Trio-tolyl)phosphine Heck vinylations with the catalyst system Pd (OAc) 2 + 4P (o-Tol) 3 exhibited a different kinetic profile. High activity is noticed for electron-poor aryl bromides; they are quantitatively converted within minutes. Deactivated substrates require considerably longer reaction times; for 4bromoanisoleFig. 2shows a sigmoidal increase in product concentration. The most apparent characteristics is the high stability of this catalyst even at temperatures around 150-160 and the absence of side reactions induced by PC bond cleavage. The phosphine concentration remains 137 constant ( Fig. 2 ) . No formation of tri ( otolyl)phosphine oxide is observed (3'P-NMR). A catalyst mixture consisting of Pd(OAc)2 and P(Mes)3 has similar characteristics including high phosphine stability (no PC bond cleavage) and product selectivity. The closely related complex Pd [ P ( o-Tol ) 3 ] z also proved to be a catalyst of similar or even enhanced activity (Table 1) [13](b),[14]. Palladiumlphosphine ratio In further experiments the phosphine concentration was varied and optimized. The results presented in Fig. 3 for the Heck vinylation of 4-bromobenzaldehyde show that the P/Pd ratio has a major influence on catalyst stability and reaction rate.

Higher P/Pd ratios (2/ 1-4/ 1) stabilize the catalyst while they reduce the rates. A large excess of phosphine (P/Pd >_ 6/ 1) strongly inhibits the Heck coupling. It is clear that unsaturated palladium phosphine species required for oxidative addition are not formed in this latter case to a sufficient extent. 2.2. Aryl chlorides Based on our results with aryl bromides we assumed that coupling of aryl chlorides could similarly be controlled by the proper choice of a stabilizing phosphine. We thus carried out a phosphine screening using 4-chlorobenzaldehyde 5a (electron-poor aryl chloride) and 4-chloroanisole 5b (electron-rich) as model compounds for the Heck olefination of aryl chlorides (Scheme 4) . Surprisingly, the best results with nbutyl acrylate as the olefin component are now found with simple triarylphosphines (PPh3, P(pTol) 3) and long-chain (diarylalkyl) diphosphines (dppb, dppen, bisbi) : electron-poor 4-chlorobenzaldehyde is converted quantitatively, giving ca. 70% of the corresponding cinnamic ester (Table 2); deactivated 4-chloroanisole yields only ca. 40% of the desired coupling product (Table 3) . Triarylphosphines Extensive PC bond cleavage, once again found in nearly all arylphosphines, is particularly detrimental to the catalytic reaction. Unwanted side Scheme 4. 139 products are formed via coupling of phosphinebound aryl groups with n-butyl acrylate (Table 2 and Table 3) . In Fig. 4a the parallel formation of n-butyl E-4-formylcinnamate (Heck product) and n-butyl E-4-methylcinnamate (side product) was recorded as a function of time for the catalyst system Pd (OAc) 2 + 4P (p-Tol) 3. One can see that side product formation ceases directly after all P (p-Tol) 3 has decomposed ( = 2 h). After that, the concentration of Heck product continues to increase while that of the side product stays constant. The detected yield ( = 12-15%) corresponds to a cleavage of more than half of all phosphine-bound aryl groups. At a conversion of approx. 70-80%, the catalyst seems no longer stabilized by the remaining phosphine oxide since palladium begins to precipitate from the solution. Side products originate analogously from isom erization of oxidative addition products (aryl-aryl exchange and phosphine scrambling) and subse quent vinylic substitution with added n-butyl acrylate (Scheme 3) . However, whereas only electron-rich aryl bromides lead to pronounced formation of side products, this is already true for electron-poor derivatives in the case of aryl chlo rides (e.g. 4-chlorobenzaldehyde). This must be due to the higher reaction temperature (150 ) and lower reactivity of these substrates.

Trio-tolyl)phosphine The ortho-methyl substituted triarylphosphines P ( o-Tol ) 3 and P( Mes ) 3 display very similar stability characteristics in the olefination of aryl chlorides. The formation of side products via PC bond cleavage is effectively inhibited, but these sterically demanding ligands (Tolman angle > 190 proved to be incapable of stabilizing the palladium catalyst in solution. Right before the minimum reaction temperature is reached, a sudden precipitation of palladium occurs. Therefore the reaction rate remains at a low level ( Fig. 4b ) . Some resid- ual catalytic activity may be due to colloidal or sintered palladium species although their thermal range of stability must be considered rather low Diphosphines Diphosphines of the type Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2 ( n =1-6 ) result in more stable metal complexes but they do not promote catalytic activity.

Long-chain diphosphines (n = 4-6, dppb, dpppen, dpph) have enhanced conformational flexibility in their backbones and allow for either monodentate or bidentate coordination. For this reason, Milstein proposed a reversible chelate opening for these ligands to rationalize the observed catalytic effects [ 7 ] (a) [ 18 ] . We find better yields for long-chain derivatives, however significant improvements in comparison with ordinary triarylphosphines (PPh3, P(p-Tol)3) could not be established. The chelating ligands bisbi and naphos [ 19] give comparable catalytic results ( = 40% yield for 5b) while producing less amounts of n-butyl cinnamate. The use of potentially chelating P-N and P-0 donor ligands Ph2P(CHZ),N(CH3)2 (n = 2, 3) and Ph2P (CHZ) ZOCH3 [ 20 ] yielded no beneficial effects. Phospholes proved to be ineffective too, presumably because of their insufficient coordination potential. Trialkylphosphines The trialkylphosphines P(i-Pr)3, P(Cy)3 and P (n-Bu) 3 - in general supporting oxidative addition reactions at Pd' centers [ 21 ] - favour another unwanted side reaction: the oxidative coupling of olefinic substrates. This reaction type, which is characteristic of strongly nucleophilic phosphines and electron-poor olefins, is preferred under the reaction conditions and strongly dominates the Heck olefination. It is operative even in the absence of palladium acetate. For example PCy3 was found to catalyze the dimerization of n-butyl acrylate to di-n-butyl 2-methylene glutarate and higher oligomers (Scheme 5) . 3. Discussion Our results in the Heck reaction show that application of the catalyst system Pd(OAc)2/PPh3 is confined to activated aryl bromides. The higher reactivity of these substrates as compared with deactivated bromides and aryl chlorides allows for quantitative conversion at temperatures well Catalysis A: Chemical 103 (1995) 133-146 143 below 120, so that side product formation and palladium precipitation primarily caused by PC bond cleavage can be avoided effectively. Phosphines are even unnecessary for activated bromides, if the reaction is performed under the phase-transfer conditions reported by Jeffrey [10]. Both the mechanism for catalyst generation starting from palladium acetate (Pd\" - Pd and the kinetically verified analogy with the complex Pd (PPh3) 4 confirm the participation of Pdintermediates in the catalytic cycle. The oxidative addition products trans-Pd (PPh3) 2 (aryl) X are commonly believed to be intermediates, too. Stoichiometric reactions with olefins in the presence of base and similar kinetic behavior strongly support this view [ 13 ] (b) . Even if these species should not represent direct intermediates, their activity proves successful integration into the catalytic cycle. Hence all results obtained so far with the catalyst system Pd(OAc)2/PPh3 point to an interplay between Pdand Pd` in the catalytic cycle, according to the early mechanism proposed by Heck. Trio-tolyl)phosphine is a much better ligand in Heck reactions of aryl bromides than triphenylphosphine. Both activated and deactivated aryl bromides are selectively and quantitatively converted into the corresponding cinnamic esters, without formation of side products. However, the high efficiency of the catalyst system Pd (OAc)2/ P (o-Tol) 3 is not based on steric grounds as has been proposed in the literature [ 9 ] (a) . The papers to follow [ 22 ] (a,b) will show the true reason of this behavior; at the same time; a new structural catalyst principle for the Heck reaction will be presented [ 22,23 ] . The studies with aryl chlorides show only little influence of structurally different phosphines. Because of the necessarily high reaction temperature phosphines act primarily as stabilizing and not so much as steering ligands. The success of the Heck reaction is therefore highly dependent upon ligands that delay or prevent palladium precipitation. Simple triarylphosphines (PPh3, P(pTol) 3) are found to stabilize the palladium l W.A. Herrmann et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 103 (1995)133-146 catalyst up to moderate or good conversions, whereas sterically demanding tri (otolyl)phosphine leads to immediate precipitation of palladium black. A complete prevention of metal precipitation seems impossible as long as arylphosphines are converted quantitatively into side products and phosphine oxide. Although side product formation is induced by PC bond cleavage in the oxidative addition complex (Scheme 3) , its intrinsic mechanism is still a matter of speculation. A reaction sequence involving orthometalation of the phosphine can be excluded because para-substituted triarylphosphines yield exclusively parasubstituted coupling products (Fig. 4a), otherwise PC bond cleavage would have resulted in meta-substituted cinnamic esters. The poor performance of aryl chlorides in the Heck reaction has previously been attributed to the low reactivity of zerovalent palladium triphenylphosphine complexes with regard to oxidative addition of the aromatic carbon-chlorine bond. As a result, palladium species were thought to accumulate as Pd' with the ultimate consequence of ready metal precipitation [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] (b) . Our results call these conclusions into question. We proved, for example, that all aryl chlorides, i.e. acceptorand donor-substituted derivatives, do add oxidatively to the phosphine complexes Pd(PPh3) 4 and Pd (PPh3)2(dba) at 100-140 [12](a). Hence not the lower rate of oxidative addition but rather isomerizations at the PdII center (aryl-aryl exchange, phosphine scrambling) and ligand degradation (PC bond cleavage + vinylic substitution) account for early catalyst deactivation. The extremely nucleophilic ligands dippp and dippb mentioned in the introduction show a tendency of attacking electron-poor olefins (e.g. acrylates) in the Heck reaction. Especially the dimerization of olefinic compounds is noticed as a major side reaction. Milstein's catalyst system is yet limited to the use of styrenes [ 7 ] . Another remarkable feature concerns the reaction temperature: although aryl chlorides easily add to Pd (dippp) 2 and Pd (dippb) 2 at 60-80 [ 18 ] (a,b), a reaction temperature of 150 was reported to allow for successful Heck coupling [ 7 ] . This discrepancy between activation step and overall reaction illustrates the importance of other elemental steps in the catalytic cycle, namely olefin insertion, /3-H elimination and reductive HCl elimination [ 18 ] (c) . Further studies aimed at an activation of aryl chlorides in the Heck reaction should concentrate on temperature-stable catalysts and measures to inhibit metal precipitation. Promising new catalytic concepts will be reported in due course [ 2224]. 4. Experimental Palladium(II) acetate was purchased from Degussa AG. Phosphines were either prepared by literature methods [9] (a),[20] or were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka or Strem. Other chemicals were from Fluka or Aldrich. The palladium complexes Pd(PPh3)4 [25], Pd(PPh3)2(Ar)X (X=Br, CI) [12],[21](c) andPd[P(o-Tol)3]2 [ 13] (b),[ 14] were synthesized according to literature methods. NMR spectra ('H, 3'P, '3C) were recorded on a JEOL JMX-GX 400 instrument. GC-MS spectra were measured on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph GC 5890 A equipped with a mass selective detector MS 5970 B. Elemental analyses were carried out by the Microanalytical Laboratory at the Technische Universit Mchen. All products were fully characterized (GC-MS, 'H-, '3C-, 3'P-NMR, EA), yields were determined by gas chromatography. Quantitative GC analyses were performed with a Hewlett Packard 5980 A instrument using a 12.5 m HP-1 capillary column in conjunction with a flame ionisation detector (GC/FID). Except for the work-up of reaction mixtures, all operations were carried out under argon. N,Ndimethyl acetamide was distilled prior to use. Catalyst solutions were freshly prepared for each reaction and only used once. 4.1. General procedure Catalyst solutions: To NN-dimethyl acetamide (20 ml) was added under argon palladium acetate WA. Herrmann et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 103 (1995) 133-146 (225 mg, 1 mmol) and triarylphosphine ( 4 mmol) or diphosphine (2 mmol) respectively (P/Pd = 4) . The mixture was stirred at room temperature until homogeneous and degased several times prior to use. Reaction mixture: In a 100 ml three-necked flask equipped with a septum inlet, a thermometer and a reflux condenser (Hg bubbler) were placed aryl halide (50 mmol), anhydrous sodium acetate (4.51 g, 55 mmol), diethylene glycol di-n-butyl ether (1 g, GC standard) and NN-dimethyl acetamide (30 ml). The reaction mixture was degased under vacuum and argon was passed over the condenser for 5 min to ensure an inert reaction atmosphere. N-butyl acrylate (10 ml, 70 mmol) was then added last because of possible losses by evaporation. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously and heated to the appropriate reaction temperature. After thermostating for 10 min the catalyst solution was injected by syringe (t=0). Circa 0.5 ml samples were continuously removed, washed with 5 ml 5% hydrochloric acid and extracted with 3.5 ml methylene chloride. The organic phases were removed and sealed in GC vials for the gas chromatographic determination of the yield. Work-up was achieved by pouring the reaction mixture at room temperature into an excess of water, extracting with methylene chloride or diethyl ether, and drying with magnesium sulphate. After removal of the extraction solvent and DMA, the products were purified by distillation or recrystallisation. For the gas chromatographic determination of reaction profiles (concentration vs. time diagrams) reactant amounts were doubled in order to ensure an approximately constant reaction volume.

The Heck reaction between aryl halides ArX (X = Br, Cl) and n-butyl acrylate was studied in the presence of catalyst systems containing Pd(OAc)2 and a tertiary phosphine ligand (PR3, R2P(CH2)PR2). It is shown that all tested arylphosphines except P(o-Tol)3 and P(Mes)3 undergo an extensive PC bond cleavage at temperatures higher than 120°C. As a consequence, vinylic side products are formed with concomitant catalyst deactivation. In the case of triarylphosphines side products originate from reaction intermediates of the type PdII(PAr3)2(Ar)X. These species undergo an aryl-aryl exchange between the palladium center and coordinated phosphine ligands.

        "dc:description": "The Heck reaction between aryl halides ArX (X = Br, Cl) and n-butyl acrylate was studied in the presence of catalyst systems containing Pd(OAc)2 and a tertiary phosphine ligand (PR3, R2P(CH2)PR2). It is shown that all tested arylphosphines except P(o-Tol)3 and P(Mes)3 undergo an extensive PC bond cleavage at temperatures higher than 120°C. As a consequence, vinylic side products are formed with concomitant catalyst deactivation. In the case of triarylphosphines side products originate from reaction intermediates of the type PdII(PAr3)2(Ar)X. These species undergo an aryl-aryl exchange between the palladium center and coordinated phosphine ligands. Subsequent intermolecular phosphine scrambling leads to several isomerized arylpalladium species, all of which couple with n-butyl acrylate to give the corresponding cinnamic ester side products.",
