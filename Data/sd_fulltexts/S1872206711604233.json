DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60423-3 ARTICLE Well-Ordered Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles as a Recoverable Catalyst for One-Pot Multicomponent Synthesis of 4H-Chromene Derivatives Yaghoub SARRAFI*, Ebrahim MEHRASBI, Amir VAHID, Mahmood TAJBAKHSH Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran Abstract: A simple, efficient, and environmentally benign protocol for the synthesis of 4H-chromene derivatives was developed using bio-compatible, neutral, and recoverable mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a catalyst. The 4H-chromene derivatives were obtained in excellent yields by three component reaction of an aldehyde or isatin, malononitrile, and cyclic 1,3-diketones in ethanol at 60 Â°C. Key words: green synthesis; multicomponent reactions; 4H-chromene derivatives; mesoporous silica nanoparticles Functionalized 4H-chromenes are common and important in a variety of natural products [1 3]. These derivatives have biological activities as antimicrobial [4], antitumor [5], hy- potensive [6], antileishmanial [7], and local anesthetic [8] agents. Among the chromene derivatives, 2-amino- 4H-chromenes with a nitrile functionality are favorite com- pounds for medicinal chemists because of their potential bio- medical application as a novel anticancer agent for human use [9 11]. The known procedures for the synthesis of these derivatives employ a three component condensation of cyclic 1,3-diketones, aryl aldehydes, and malononitrile, and are per- formed under various reaction conditions. The conventional synthesis of 4H-chromene derivatives utilize triethylamine in an organic solvent [12]. 4H-Chromenes have been synthesized using microwave [13,14] radiation and an electrochemically generated base [15]. Recently, a variety of methods for several modified procedures using alkyl ammonium salts [16,17], p-dodecyl-benezenesulfonic acid (DBSA) [18], LiBr [19], Na 2 SeO 4 [20], Re(PFO) 3 [21], KF/Al 2 O 3 [22], (S)-proline [23], (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 [24], N-methylimidazole [25], lipase (enzyme) [26], and silica nanoparticles [27] have been reported. Al- though each of these methods has merit, some procedures required the use of a hazardous amine-based catalyst [12], toxic organic solvents [15,22], or long reaction time [15,21]. The main drawback of almost all existing methods is that the catalyst is not recyclable [12 17,20,22 26]. Therefore, there is still the need to develop better alternatives that can proceed under mild, simple, efficient, and environmentally benign reaction conditions. Ever since the discovery of MCM-41 mesoporous silica, these structurally ordered materials have been used as a solid support for various catalysts due to their high surface areas and tunable pore size [28 31]. Mesoporous materials can facilitate the diffusion of bulky organic molecules into and out of the porous structure [29,32 34]. Nanoparticles (NPs) have at- tracted attention in catalysis for their improved efficiency under mild and environmentally benign conditions conducive to green chemistry [35,36]. Considerable research efforts have been made for the synthesis of nano-sized particles of mesoporous silica materials to use for increasing the surface area of the active component of the catalyst. NPs can enhance the contact between reactants and catalyst and mimic homo- geneous catalysts. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted considerable interest in the life and materials science [37]. Their unique properties, such as tunable and uniform diameter (50â€“200 nm), tunable pore size (2â€“4 nm) and high specific surface area (800â€“1000 m 2 /g), make them versatile for a large range of applications in drug delivery [38], MRI [39], cancer Yaghoub SARRAFI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1486â€“1494 cell targeting [40], photodynamic therapy [41], antireflective coatings [42], and catalysis [43 45]. A number of recent re- ports on the functionalization of MSNs have given several interesting systems for catalysis [43 45]. However, the cata- lytic activity of non-functionalized MSNs in organic trans- formation has not been studied. As part of our program for developing environmentally benign synthesis methodologies [46 48], we report here a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of functionalized 4H-chromenes by the three com- ponent one-pot condensation of aldehydes or isatin derivatives, malononitrile, and cyclic 1,3-diketones using well-ordered MSNs as a green and reusable catalyst (Scheme 1). 1 Experimental All the chemicals were purchased from Merck, Fluka, and Sigma-Aldrich. The reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Seifert TT 3000 diffractometer using Cu K a radiation of wavelength 0.15405 nm. Diffraction data were recorded in the 2È™ region of 1Â° 10Â° at a step interval of 0.01Â°. A scanning rate of 1.0Â°/min was used. Scanning electron mi- croscopy (SEM) was recorded using a Zeiss DSM 962 (Oberkochen, Germany). Samples were deposited on a sample holder with an adhesive carbon foil and sputtered with gold. Adsorption of nitrogen was measured at 77 K using a BEL- SORP mini-porosimeter. The pore size distribution was cal- culated from the desorption branch using the Bar- rett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [49]. Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX-400 AVANCE instrument (400.1 MHz for 1 H and 100.6 MHz for 13 C). IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Heraeus CHN-O Rapid ana- lyzer. 1.1 Preparation of MSNs In a typical synthesis, 2.6 g of cetylmethylammonium bro- mide (CTAB) was added to 69 g of deionized water and stirred to give a clear solution. Ethanol (8.2 g) was added to the sur- factant solution. Then, 9.3 g of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate (28 wt% SiO 2 , 5 wt% Na 2 O, 67 wt% H 2 O) was added to the surfactant solution to yield a white suspension. At the end of this step, 25 g of sodium carboxy methyl cellulose solution (12 wt% in water) was added to the suspension and stirred for 2 h followed by 2 d aging in an oven at 343 K. Then, the pre- cipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at 373 K overnight. The product obtained was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined with a heating rate of 1 K/min to 823 K and held at this temperature for 5 h in air. 1.2 Representative procedure for the preparation of 2-amino-5-oxo-4-(phenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene -3-carbonitrile 4a and spiro[(4H-chromene)-4,3'-oxindole] 6a A mixture of benzaldehyde or isatin (1 mmol), malonitrile (1 mmol), 3,3-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (1 mmol), and MSNs (10 mg) in ethanol (3 ml) was stirred at 60 Â°C. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the ethanol was evaporated. EtOAc (10 ml) was added to the mixture, stirred for 5 min, and MSNs was filtered out using filter paper. Then, the solvent of the filtrate was evaporated and the crude product was purified by recrystallization from hot ethanol. The recycled catalyst was washed with EtOAc and acetone, dried and reused. The products were characterized by the compari- son of their spectral ( 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR) and physical data with those reported in the literature. 4,4'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4 H-chromene-3-carbonitrile) (4q).

The data are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Powder XRD experiments were performed in order to in- vestigate the mesoporous structure of the calcined sample and structural properties in terms of the long range order of the pores. There were five well defined Bragg peaks at low angles. The XRD peaks could be indexed to the hexagonal lattice of MCM-41. A very prominent peak corresponding to the d 100 plane suggested the formation of a hexagonal array of pores. The SEM image of MSNs showed that the silica particles were in the nanometer range (60 350 nm). As illustrated in Fig. 2, N 2 adsorption-desorption measurement for the MSNs demon- strated a Type IV isotherm, which is the characteristic of mesoporous materials [49]. The specific surface area and total pore volume of the catalyst determined from the BET equation were 639 m 2 /g and 0.56 cm 3 /g, respectively. The sharp inflection over a narrow relative pressure range from 0.32 to 0.37 indicated that capillary condensation oc- curred in the mesopores and the sharpness of this step showed (a) 012345678910 (300) (210) (200) (110) I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (100) (b) Fig. 1.

N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the MSNs. Yaghoub SARRAFI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1486â€“1494 that the MSNs have uniform mesopores. Further evidence for this was the fact that the desorption branch of the isotherm nearly coincided with the adsorption branch, which revealed reversible nitrogen adsorption inside the mesopores. Moreover, this reversible behavior implied that most pores in the sample were open pores connected directly to the surface of the MSNs and so were accessible to guest molecules such as nitrogen. These results were in agreement with the XRD patterns. The MSNs were tested as the catalyst in the synthesis of 2-amino-5-oxo-4-aryl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carb onitrile 4a. At the start of this investigation, the one-pot three component reaction of benzaldehyde 2a, malononitrile 3 and 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione 1a (1 mmol each) in EtOH was employed as a model reaction. This reaction was per- formed using different solid catalysts such as MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves, SiO 2 , nano-SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and MSNs. Among the different solids used, the best result was obtained with the MSNs as the catalyst (Table 1, entry 9). The yield increase for the 4H-chromene derivative 4a with the MSNs catalyst compared with amorphous silica and alumina may be due to both the presence of reactive â€“OH groups on and inside the pores and the higher surface area of the MSNs. In- terestingly, the MSNs had a higher catalytic activity than MCM-41 because the nano-sized particles of the MSNs in- creased the exposed surface area of the active component of the catalyst. The model reaction was also performed in the pres- ence of nano-SiO 2 (10 mg) in which an increase in the reaction time (35 min) and decrease in the yield (87%) were observed (Table 1, entry 4). Next, we examined the appropriate loading of MSNs. It was found that 10 mg of MSNs was enough to promote the reaction efficiently in a short time (Table 1, entry 9). The reaction did not proceed well without a catalyst and only gave mixtures of dimedon and unsaturated nitriles. Therefore, the presence of the MSNs was necessary for this reaction. The reaction was also performed in water as a green and easily available solvent (Table 1, entry 10), but as compared with EtOH, the yield was lower and needed a longer reaction time. After optimization of the reaction conditions, the scope and generality of these conditions with other reactants were ex- amined by using a variety of aliphatic (Table 2, entries 19 and 20) and aromatic aldehydes, cyclic 1,3-diketones and malononitrile. The results are summarized in Table 2. All the reactions proceeded smoothly under the optimized conditions and all the reactions were satisfactorily completed within 10â€“45 min. To study the recyclability of the catalyst, the MSNs were used for the same reaction repeatedly and the change in their catalytic activity was studied. The relation between the number of cycles of the reaction and the catalytic activity in terms of yield of product is presented in Fig. 3. The MSNs can be re- cycled and reused as a catalyst for at least five times without losing activity. In comparison with some other catalysts recently reported for the synthesis of 4H-chromenes, the MSNs employed here gave equal or higher catalytic activity in terms of reaction times and yields (Table 3).

The catalyst can be recycled and reused without losing activity. The mild and neutral reaction condi- tions, excellent product yields, high reaction rates and easy recyclability of the catalyst make this a better alternative to the conventional process, and it is also an environmentally greener and safer synthesis procedure.

ARTICLE Well-Ordered Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles as a Recoverable Catalyst for One-Pot Multicomponent Synthesis of 4H-Chromene Derivatives Yaghoub SARRAFI * Ebrahim MEHRASBI Amir VAHID Mahmood TAJBAKHSH Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran * Corresponding author. Tel/Fax: +98-1125342350 A simple, efficient, and environmentally benign protocol for the synthesis of 4H-chromene derivatives was developed using bio-compatible, neutral, and recoverable mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a catalyst. The 4H-chromene derivatives were obtained in excellent yields by three component reaction of an aldehyde or isatin, malononitrile, and cyclic 1,3-diketones in ethanol at 60 °C. Graphical abstract Synthesis of 4H-chromenes by three component condensation of aldehydes or isatines, malononitrile, and cyclic 1,3-diketones was performed using mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a reusable catalyst.
