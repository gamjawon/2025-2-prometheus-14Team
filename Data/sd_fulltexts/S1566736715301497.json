Clean Energy Research Center Korea Institute of Science and Technology Seoul 136-791 Republic of Korea Molybdenum-doped porous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanostructures were successfully synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a simple electrospinning technique. These nanostructures were used as the photoanode for solar water oxidation. Post hot-pressing treatment was crucial in improving the photocurrents of electrospun BiVO4 by contributing to their adhesion on the substrate and for charge separation. Graphical abstract Keywords Electrospinning BiVO4 Hot-pressing Water oxidation Photoelectrocatalyst 1 Introduction Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a clean and sustainable pathway to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy. By mimicking a natural photosynthesis system, semiconductors in a PEC water splitting system can convert solar energy into chemical energy which can be used as fuels instead of the conventional fossil fuels. [1] However, improvements in conversion efficiency are required for industrial applications. Therefore, research efforts for developing semiconductor materials with efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transfer, etc. are under progress. The nanostructures of semiconductors have been intensively studied to improve their PEC activities, because morphology significantly influences their optical, electrical, and catalytic properties. For example, a high surface-to-volume ratio of the porous nanostructure can be favorable in providing a large interfacial surface area between the semiconductor and the electrolyte where photogenerated charge carriers can be separated and catalytic reactions can occur. In addition, a nanoporous structure is considered to be especially superior for BiVO4 because it can overcome its short diffusion length [2]. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanoflowers are also advantageous for facile charge transport along the 1D structures as well as for charge separation across their large interfacial surface areas. Moreover, nanostructures can act as light scattering centers to improve light absorption [3]. Electrospinning is a fascinating method for the synthesis of 1D nanofibers wherein their diameters can be easily controlled by modulating the synthetic parameters such as applied electrostatic force, flow rate, and composition of the polymer/metal precursor [4]. It can also introduce porosity in the fiber structures during the calcination process. Electrospinning of several metal oxide nanofibers has been studied for various applications, including photocatalytic degradation [5–7] and PEC water splitting [8,9], because of the unique structures it can generate. Herein, we have focused on BiVO4 because of its visible light absorption capability (bandgap=2.4–2.5eV) and excellent stability in a neutral pH electrolyte [10]. Despite the interesting morphology, most of the studies were carried out with the BiVO4 nanofiber suspended in an electrolyte, and not fixed on the electrode presumably due to its poor adhesion on the bottom substrate [11]. We have successfully synthesized BiVO4 nanofibers on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by electrospinning without a template and have characterized their photoanode performance. Further, the BiVO4 nanofibers were doped with molybdenum followed by post hot-pressing to improve charge separation and contact adhesion on the substrate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Electrospun BiVO4 photoanode preparation 0.5624g of Bi(NO3)3 ∙5H2O (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.3074g of VO(acac)2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a 7.73mL solvent mixture of 3:5:4.2 (by volume ratio) CH3COOH (≥99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (≥99.9%, J.T.Baker), and N,N-dimethylformamide (≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). Further, 0.35g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw=1,300,000, Sigma-Aldrich) was added. A clean FTO substrate (8Ω, Pilkington) was placed on the collector of an electrospinning (NanoNC Co., Ltd., Korea) chamber. The distance between the collector and needle was fixed at 15cm with an applied voltage of 15kV, and a solution flow rate of 10μL/min. After electrospinning, it was annealed at 500°C in air for 1h. 0.0076g of MoO2(acac)2 (99%, Alfa aesar) was added to the precursor solution for Mo doping, and the other electrospinning conditions were maintained. Hot-pressing was performed with preheated metallic plates at 120°C for 30s, followed by annealing at 500°C for 1h. 2.2 Photoelectrochemical measurements Currents of the BiVO4 and Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes were measured by a potentiostat (Ivium Technologies) in a 0.1M potassium phosphate (K-Pi) buffered electrolyte (pH7.0). For the photocurrent measurement, simulated sunlight was produced by a solar simulator (ABET, Sun. 2000) and passed through the quart window of an electrochemical cell to illuminate the working electrodes. The solar simulator was equipped with a 300W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter, and the input power intensity (100mWcm−2) was confirmed with a reference silicon solar cell. A three-electrode configuration was employed with a Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a BiVO4 photoanode as the working electrode. All measured potentials were converted relatively to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using E (vs. RHE)=E (vs. Ag/AgCl)+0.209+0.0591V×pH. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and other material characterization methods are described in ESI†. 3 Results and discussion The morphology of the electrospun 1D nanofibers was obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1 ). The smooth surface of nanofibers became rougher during calcination at 500°C in air because PVP was eliminated and the remaining Bi and V precursors were oxidized to form porous nanofibers similar to the other electrospun fibers (Fig. 1(a)–(b)). Mo is one of the most effective dopants in improving the PEC performance of the BiVO4 photoanode as it influences electronic properties such as carrier concentrations [12]. Therefore, to increase the PEC activity, Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) was prepared by adding molybdenum oxide in the precursor solution. SEM image (Fig. 1(c)) showed that the morphologies of the 1D nanofibers were not affected by the molybdenum precursor. The thickness of the electrospun films was ~8.2 μm (Fig. S1 in ESI†) for both the BiVO4 and the Mo:BiVO4 nanofibers. Efficient light absorption was expected and as shown in UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 1(d)), the almost identical light absorption spectra of the BiVO4 and the Mo:BiVO4 nanofibers indicate that Mo doping does not change the light absorption property including the bandgap. The BiVO4 nanofiber films absorbed up to ~500nm wavelength of light, corresponding to a 2.5eV bandgap for BiVO4, consistent with the reported value. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the electrospun BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 nanofiber films had monoclinic scheelite-type BiVO4 crystal structure, a popular and active phase for photocatalysts. Monoclinic BiVO4 is known to have the highest photocatalytic activity for water oxidation compared to other crystal structures such as tetragonal structures because of a smaller bandgap [13]. The XRD patterns were almost identical with/without Mo dopant implying that doping did not change the crystal structure significantly in this level, consistent with the previous reports [14]. Peaks from bottom FTO substrate were also observed as denoted, but no peaks from molybdenum oxide crystals were observed. Raman spectra shows that the major Raman peak centered at 827.165cm−1 in undoped BiVO4 associated with the symmetric stretching modes of V–O bonds. (Fig. 2(b)) After doping with Mo, the peak was redshifted by 5.765cm−1 (Raman peak centered at 821.4cm−1). Although the change was little, the shift of the Raman peak is consistent with the previous studies. [15] The previous studies reported that redshift of the major Raman peak by molybdenum doping in BiVO4 because Mo is substituted into the lattice of BiVO4 in the place of V. The other Raman shifts are also well matched with those of monoclinic BiVO4 [16], consistently with XRD measurement. We also did not obtain Raman peak at 819.4cm−1 attributed to MoO3 indicating no oxide was formed in the Mo:BiVO4 fibers. The presence of Mo in the Mo:BiVO4 nanofiber was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 2(c)–(d)). Molybdenum was only observed with the doped sample, and its oxidation state in the BiVO4 crystal was characterized from the binding energy of Mo 3d 5/2 . Fig. 2(d) showed that the doped molybdenum has a peak at 232.7eV, well consistent with hexavalent molybdenum ion (Mo6+ ion), and other Mo 3d 5/2 binding energies such as 227.8eV (metallic molybdenum) and 229.2eV (molybdenum oxide) were not observed. Combining with Raman analysis, we confirmed that hexavalent Mo ions are successfully doped in Mo:BiVO4 fibers. Meanwhile, the binding energies of Bi 4f and V 2p of the Mo:BiVO4 nanofiber was maintained by those of the BiVO4 nanofiber (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The PEC activity (Fig. 3 ) of each sample was measured in 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer solution (K-Pi, pH7.0) under simulated sunlight. Although Mo doping did not change the morphology and the light absorption property of the nanofiber photoanodes, PEC performance of Mo:BiVO4 was noticeably higher compared to the undoped BiVO4 nanofibers. For example, at 1.5V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of Mo:BiVO4 (0.1735mA/cm2) was higher by 2.5 times compared to the undoped BiVO4 (0.07mA/cm2). The relatively low photocurrent density can be attributed to the slow water oxidation reaction on the bare BiVO4 surface, considering the visible light absorption capability. Among the oxygen evolution catalysts for water oxdiation, Co–Pi [17] and NiOOH [2] as cocatalyst materials, have shown significant improvement in the photocurrent density on the BiVO4 surface. Short diffusion length of the charge carriers in BiVO4 can cause recombination loss before efficient charge separation, so doping with metal ions such as Mo or W can improve the photocatalytic activity by increasing the carrier concentration in BiVO4 [12]. However, even after Mo doping to enhance the photocurrents, Mo:BiVO4 nanofiber cloths still showed low photocurrent densities. Losses may be attributed to hopping of the charge carriers across the porous fiber network or contact problems between nanofibers and the FTO substrate that can prohibit efficient electron collection from the photocatalyst to the FTO substrate [11]. Post hot-pressing was conducted on the as-electrospun Mo-doped BiVO4 nanofiber sample (HP Mo:BiVO4), and it was found that electrode preparation was critical in improving the photoanodic activity. Another 1.5 times increase in the photocurrent density (0.272mA/cm2) was achieved by hot-pressing the Mo:BiVO4 at 120°C for 30s. The SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (inset of Fig. 3 and S3 in ESI†) revealed that hot-pressing enhances the interconnection between the porous fibers and adhesion of fiber cloths on the FTO substrate. Improved physical networking can overcome limitations such as low charge transfer rate and short diffusion length across the porous structures. PEC performance was further characterized in the presence of the SO3 2− hole scavenger to exclude the effect of the slow water oxidation kinetics on the BiVO4 surface (Fig. 4(a)). The photocurrent density was measured under chopped simulated sunlight. The photocurrent (JPEC) can be expressed as a combination of the photon absorption rate (Jabs), charge separation efficiency that is a measure of the photogenerated holes reaching the surface (η sep ), and charge injection efficiency (η inj ) from the surface to the solution species (JPEC =Jabs × η sep × η inj ). BiVO4 generally exhibits poor η inj for water oxidation due to large overpotential and thus the photocurrent is limited without surface co-catalyst modification [18]. However, when SO3 2− is present, the hole injection efficiency can be considered as unity due to easy and fast oxidation. This highlights the influence of hot-pressing on the charge separation efficiency. From the photocurrent density with the hole scavenger (Fig. 4(a)), we know that JPEC and η sep follow the same tendency (i.e. Mo:BiVO4 has higher η sep than BiVO4, and HP Mo:BiVO4 shows the highest value). It can be inferred that hot-pressing helps charge separation within the BiVO4 nanofiber film and/or the interface between BiVO4 and FTO, as mentioned above. Charge separation of the BiVO4 photoanode can be further analyzed from EIS measurements (Fig. 4(b)). Because of the porosity of the BiVO4 electrode, the equivalent circuit as shown in inset of the Fig. 4(b) was considered [19]. R1 is the series resistance of the total cell, R2 and CPE1 are the charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance at the porous electrode, respectively. R3 and CPE2 are the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance at BiVO4/electrolyte interface [19]. None of the BiVO4 photoanodes showed considerable differences in R1 values, i.e. R1BiVO4 =30 Ω, R1Mo: BiVO4 =29 Ω, R1HP Mo:BiVO4 =27Ω, because R1 is mainly affected by the series resistance of the substrate or solution. On the other hand, the values of R2 were significant as lower charge transfer resistance indicates easy charge transport at the BiVO4 electrode which in turn contributes to higher photocurrents. Significant decreases in R2 values were observed with Mo doping and hot-pressing. The value of R2 of the undoped BiVO4 fiber was 14,031 Ω, which decreased to 8387 Ω for Mo:BiVO4 and further decreased to 7823Ω after hot-pressing. This trend supports the photocurrent measurement study with/without the hole scavenger, suggesting that Mo doping and hot-pressing facilitate internal charge separation of the BiVO4 electrode. 4 Conclusions The successful synthesis of Mo-doped BiVO4 porous nanofiber films on a FTO substrate by electrospinning without templates was demonstrated. The PEC performance of the BiVO4 nanofibers was improved by Mo doping and further enhancement in photocurrent was achieved by hot-pressing the Mo:BiVO4 nanofibers to enhance physical contact and internal charge transfer efficiency. This method of electrospinning and post hot-pressing can be utilized for controlling the internal charge transfer resistance and improving the photoelectrochemical activity. It can also be utilized in other fields for electrochemical applications such as in batteries or in photovoltaic cells.
