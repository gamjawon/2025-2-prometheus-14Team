Liquid phase aerobic oxidation of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons using iron metal organic frameworks as solid heterogeneous catalyst Nagarathinam Nagarjun Amarajothi Dhakshinamoorthy ⁎ School of Chemistry, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, 625 021, Tamil Nadu, India School of Chemistry Madurai Kamaraj University Madurai Tamil Nadu 625 021 India ⁎ Corresponding author. Graphical abstract Aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons is one of the research fronts in organic chemistry as well as in chemical engineering. In this aspect, many efforts are devoted to develop heterogeneous catalysts that can convert hydrocarbon to its corresponding alcohol/ketone (ol/one) with selectivity more than 90%. However, achieving this target becomes difficult due to possible secondary reactions of initially formed ol/one mixture. Hence, this study aims to report the catalytic activity of Fe(BTC) (BTC: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) in aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane at 73% conversion to its respective ol/one with 84% selectivity after 24 h at 120 °C in the absence of any radical initiators. Interestingly, the selectivity of ol/one is higher than 90% at cyclooctane conversion around 20% under present reaction conditions. Reusability and leaching experiments demonstrate the stability of Fe(BTC) during the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the present catalytic system can also be extended to oxidize other linear hydrocarbons to their respective ol/one products with the selectivity ranging between 88–97 %. Keywords Aerobic oxidation Cyclooalkane Hydrocarbons Heterogeneous catalysis Metal organic frameworks 1 Introduction The development of efficient and selective processes for the functionalization of C–H bond in hydrocarbons through oxidation is one of the fundamental organic reactions which have been reported using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts [1]. This development was inspired by highly selective and efficient C–H bond oxidation in biological processes using enzymes [2–4]. On other hand, various transition metal based homogeneous catalysts have been reported for the oxidation of C–H bond in the past decades [5–10]. Series of metal catalysts in the presence of various oxidants such as KHSO5, organic peroxides, PhIO, KMnO4, perchlorate and peracids were also employed as homogenous catalysts for the oxidation of C–H bond, however, posing serious environmental issues like generation of considerable waste, lower selectivity of ol/one and so on [11]. In contrast, numerous efforts have been made to develop heterogeneous catalysts that can operate the oxidation of C–H bond using molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide as oxidants since they are considered as environmentally benign as water is the only by-product formed [11]. This was mainly due to the fact that these processes can afford higher selectivity of ol/one, catalyst can be reused and produces lesser amount of waste. In one way, these objectives could satisfy the challenges put forward in front of chemists to develop organic reactions or processes based on the principles of green chemistry. Furthermore, the direct oxidation of alkanes to their respective ol/one using molecular oxygen represents one of the sustainable synthetic methods with high atom economy [12]. Also, one of the challenging tasks in the C–H bond oxidation in alkanes is to achieve higher selectivity of ol/one at a conversion of alkane below 10% using environmentally benign oxidants like molecular oxygen under mild reaction conditions without any radical initiators. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are relatively new class of porous hybrid materials [13] whose crystal structure is constituted by the coordination of metal ions or clusters with rigid organic linkers through Coulombic and coordinative bonds to form one, two and three-dimensional networks [14,15]. These materials are often characterized by their notable surface area, porosity and their tunable nature of active sites. These properties of MOFs have attracted large number of research groups to develop promising applications in many fields such as molecular separation [16], ion exchange [17], gas storage [18], drug delivery [19] and as host for metal nanoparticles [20–22]. Although MOFs have been used as potential materials for wide range of applications [23], heterogeneous catalysis is one of the areas in where MOFs have played a significant role in achieving higher conversion without compromising the selectivity for a large number of reactions [24–28]. Selective oxidation of cyclooctane to cyclooctanone is an important reaction since cyclooctanone serves as a monomeric building block in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products [29]. Cyclooctane is one of the cyclic hydrocarbons very frequently used as a model substrate to evaluate the activity of MOFs. In this aspect, N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) loaded over [Co(DMA)6]3[(Co4Cl)3−(BTT)8(H2O)12]2.12H2O (BTT3−: 1,3,5-benzenetristetrazolate; DMA: N,N’-dimethylacetamide) MOF was reported as heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane achieving 48% conversion with 78% selectivity to ol/one after 29 h at 120 °C [30]. Similarly, NHPI loaded on Fe(BTC) was reported as solid heterogeneous catalyst promoting aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane reaching 71% conversion at 61% selectivity to ol/one at 120 °C [31]. In another precedent, MOF-253 was reported as heterogeneous catalyst showing 70.8% conversion of cyclooctane with 66% selectivity to cyclooctanone at 150 °C after 4 h under aerobic conditions [32]. Furthermore, copper-5-(4-pyridyl)tetrazolate MOFs were reported to convert cyclooctane to a mixture of ol/one in 21.8% yield using hydrogen peroxide or tert-butylhydro peroxide at room temperature after 10 h [33]. In another report, MIL-100(Al) encapsulated tris(1,10-phenanthroline) Cu(II) complexes was used as heterogeneous solid catalyst promoting the oxidation of cyclooctane at 9% conversion using hydrogen peroxide in acetonitrile at 70 °C [34]. On other hand, tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrinatomanganese(III) acetate covalently attached to chloromethylated MIL-101 exhibiting the oxidation of cyclooctane reaching 72% conversion with 58% selectivity to cyclooctanone using NaIO4 in water/acetonitrile mixture at room temperature [35]. Also, sandwich-type polyoxometalate {(TBA)7H3[Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]} immobilized on MIL-101 was reported as solid catalyst to oxidize cyclooctane with 55% conversion at 72% ol/one selectivity using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant at 80 °C [36]. Fe(BTC) is one of the commonly used MOFs as an efficient support for the immobilization of enzymes [37] as well as for organic transformations [11,14]. Fe(BTC) exhibits in the form of a semi-crystalline/semi-amorphous nature, but however, powder X-ray diffraction studies indicated a close structural relationship with a well known crystalline MOF material, MIL-100(Fe) [38–40]. Further, MIL-100(Fe) is an iron(III) carboxylate constituted between the trimers of iron octahedra sharing a common vertex μ3-O. These trimers are coordinated to BTC linkers thus resulting in the formation of hybrid supertetrahedra with two types of mesoporous cages of free apertures of ca. 25 and 29 Å, that are accessible through microporous windows of ca. 5.5 and 8.6 Å [41]. Although MIL-100(Fe) and Fe(BTC) possess nearly same chemical composition, Fe(BTC) consists only one type of mesopore cage of 22 Å and BET surface area around 1450-1500 m2/g. In addition, catalytic activity studies revealed that the semi-crystalline Fe(BTC) showed better activity for those reactions requiring acidic sites while MIL-100(Fe) exhibited more activity for redox reactions [39]. Further, Fe(BTC) has been reported as a heterogeneous solid catalyst to promote wide range of organic reactions [14,42,43]. Although, Fe(BTC) is unable to promote aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons without organic peroxides, this MOF has been widely explored to effect oxidation reactions using certain cocatalysts. Quaternary ammonium salts have been successfully used as phase transfer co-catalysts to promote oxidation reactions [44,45] and other organic reactions [46–48] due to their unique properties of thermal stability, remarkable solubility and non-flammable nature. In the present work, we wish to report the catalytic activity of Fe(BTC) MOF for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane and some linear alkanes to their corresponding ol/ones using TBAB as an additive. One of the main objectives of this work is to achieve higher selectivity of ol/one at a conversion of alkane > 20% without the assistance of radical initiator under mild reaction conditions. Some of the salient features of this work compared to earlier precedents are easy availability of MOFs, no further post-functionalization of MOFs, absence of noble metals, lower reaction temperature, high ol/one selectivity and absence of radical initiators. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Cyclooctane and other linear hydrocarbons were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Fe(BTC) was procured from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Solvents and quaternary ammonium salts were also purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2.2 Instrumentation FT-IR spectra were measured with a Bruker tensor 27 series FT-IR spectrometer in the region of 400-4000 cm−1 with 2 cm−1 resolution. Powder XRD diffraction patterns were recorded in the refraction mode using Philips X’Pert diffractometer with the CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5417 Å) as the incident beam, PW3050/60 (2 theta) as Goniometer. SEM images were measured with Hitachi S-3000H scanning electron microscope. The conversion and selectivity of a catalytic oxidation reaction was determined by Agilent 7820 A model with flame ionization detector using high pure nitrogen as carrier gas. The products were identified by GC-MS of Agilent 5820 A model and also by co-injecting with authentic samples. 2.3 General procedure for the oxidation of cyclooctane In a typical catalytic oxidation reaction, the reaction flask was charged with 25 mg of Fe(BTC) followed by the addition of TBAB (20 mg), cyclooctane (1 mL). This heterogeneous reaction mixture was purged with molecular oxygen through a balloon. To this mixture, 1 mL of solvent was added and then it was placed on a preheated oil bath maintained at 120 °C. This reaction mixture was stirred for the required time as shown in Table 1 . A known amount of aliquot was periodically taken, diluted with acetonitrile and filtered with a syringe filter. This sample was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine conversion and selectivity using internal standard. After the required time, the reaction was stopped and the reaction flask was allowed to cool to room temperature. Later, the mixture was diluted with acetonitrile and filtered. This sample was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the final conversion and selectivity as mentioned above. Similar experimental procedure was performed for reusability experiments except the catalyst. After the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed well with acetonitrile and dried at 100 °C for 3 h. This sample was used for reusability experiments with fresh reactants. Furthermore, the above explained procedure was performed either in the presence of TEMPO (25 mg) or hydroquinone (25 mg) as control runs to identify the nature of active sites. Homogeneous experiments were performed under identical conditions described above using Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (38 mg) and FeCl3.6H2O (26 mg) as soluble catalysts under identical iron loading compared to Fe(BTC). 3 Results and discussion The aerobic oxidation reaction using Fe(BTC) as a catalyst and TBAB as an additive was optimized by selecting cyclooctane as a model substrate. The oxidation of cyclooctane gave cyclooctanol (ol) and cyclooctanone (one) as primary oxidation products. The aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane in the absence of Fe(BTC) and TBAB exhibited <2% conversion at 120 °C in DMF as solvent. On other hand, aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane using Fe(BTC) as catalyst in the absence of TBAB resulted 4% conversion with 79% ol/one selectivity in DMF as solvent. Further, aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane in the presence of TBAB without Fe(BTC) afforded 30% conversion with 75% selectivity to ol/one in DMF. In addition, aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane using Fe(BTC) as catalyst and TBAB as additive exhibited 73% conversion with 84 % ol/one selectivity after 24 h in DMF at 120 °C. Fig. 1 shows the time conversion profile for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane with the selectivity of ol and one. The nature of active sites and the identification of the location where reaction takes place were screened by performing two additional experiments with Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and FeCl3.6H2O as homogeneous catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of cyclooctane using Fe(BTC) as heterogeneous solid catalyst with Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and FeCl3.6H2O as homogeneous catalysts under identical conditions with similar iron loading. These results imply that Fe3+ plays an essential role in promoting the aerobic oxidation reaction. On other hand, Fe(BTC) exhibited more than 90% selectivity of ol/one at around 35% conversion of cyclooctane which is much superior than with these homogeneous catalysts under similar experimental conditions. Furthermore, the kinetic data reveal that FeCl3.6H2O deactivates after 7 h whereas Fe(BTC) still active and promotes cyclooctane oxidation. These catalytic data indicate that the cyclooctane reaction occurs within the confined pores of Fe(BTC) thus leading to high ol/one selectivity than homogeneous catalysts. The reaction was also optimized with respect to the reaction temperature, namely at 80 and 100 °C. As it can be seen in Table 1, the decrease of reaction temperature from 120 to 100 and 80 °C, the conversion of cyclooctane was reduced significantly from 73 to 44 and 7%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. These catalytic data indicate that the reaction rate is highly influenced by the reaction temperature, but however, the selectivity to ol/one ratio was not much altered. Fig. 3 shows the time conversion plot for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane at different temperatures. The catalytic data from Fig. 3 revealed that oxidation reaction at lower temperature (80 °C) is accompanied with induction period up to 6 h while oxidation reactions at higher temperatures (100 and 120 °C) showed no induction period. The aerobic oxidation was also performed in other solvents like chlorobenzene and p-xylene and the observed data are given in Table 1. The catalytic data clearly indicate that the aerobic oxidation rate was much faster in DMF than with chlorobenzene and p-xylene under identical conditions. Furthermore, the aerobic oxidation was also screened with other ammonium slats like tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and tetrheptylammonium bromide (THAB) under identical reaction conditions. The observed results are given in Table 1. The aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane using Fe(BTC) as catalyst with TBAI showed 64% conversion with 78% ol/one selectivity while with THAB gave 61% conversion with 71% ol/one selectivity. These results suggest that the conversion of cyclooctane was lower using TBAI and THAB compared to TBAB as additive. This may be due to the steric nature of iodide and long alkyl chains in THAB ammonium salts. In any case, these ammonium slats in combination with Fe(BTC) favours oxidation of cyclooctane showing high selectivity of the desired ol/one mixture. In contrast, aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane was only 33% conversion using Fe(BTC) as catalyst with AgBF4 under identical conditions. These results clearly indicate that higher conversion of cyclooctane without compromising the selectivity to ol/one is achieved by the combined use of Fe(BTC) and TBAB. Aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane was also performed at lower cyclooctane concentration in DMF under identical conditions to further increase the conversion of cyclooctane and selectivity towards ol/one. The achieved results are presented in Table 1. These catalytic data indicate that the conversion of cyclooctane drastically reduced when cyclooctane was taken at lower concentration in DMF. This may be due to the slower diffusion of cyclooctane towards the pores of Fe(BTC) compared to DMF. This observation was in agreement with earlier precedent in where the rate of the reaction was decreased for the aerobic oxidation of n-hexane, methylcyclohexane and diphenylmethane using MOF-253 at 150 °C [32]. These results suggest that the concentration of hydrocarbon, solvent ratio and nature of solvent are essential parameters in determining the conversion of hydrocarbon and its corresponding ol/one selectivity. After optimizing the reaction conditions for the oxidation of cyclooctane, one of the essential experiments to be performed in heterogeneous catalysts is to rationalize that the reaction proceeds by the presence of solid catalyst rather than the leached active species to the reaction mixture. In this aspect, leaching experiment was performed under identical reaction conditions and the observed catalytic data are plotted in Fig. 4 . The aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane was performed in the presence of Fe(BTC) under optimized reaction conditions. Then, the solid catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration after 3 h and the filtrate was allowed to continue up to 24 h. The aliquots were taken from the filtrate in the absence of catalyst and analyzed by gas chromatography. The catalytic results with and without catalyst are compared and these results indicate that the removal of catalyst after 3 h from the reaction mixture significantly affect the rate of the reaction. This experiment implies that the presence of Fe(BTC) is essential to promote aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane and further the reaction is catalyzed by the active sites of solid catalyst. Hence, this oxidation reaction is heterogeneous in nature. Further, the reaction mixture was analyzed by ICP-OES analysis and indicated negligible amount of iron, thus suggesting the stability of Fe(BTC) catalyst. The activity data for aerobic oxidation in Table 1 indicate that TBAB plays an active role in achieving high conversion and selectivity. Hence, the amount of TBAB was also optimized under identical reaction conditions. The catalytic results in Fig. 5 reveal that the rate of the reaction increases when TBAB loading increased from 10 to 20 mg and further increase to 30 mg showed slightly lower conversion of cyclooctane than 20 mg. Hence, among the three TBAB loadings tested, the use of 20 mg of TBAB showed the highest conversion of cyclooctane and hence further experiments were performed with this loading. The reaction mechanism and the nature of active sites was elucidated by conducting series of control experiments under the optimized reaction conditions and the role of oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane using Fe(BTC) as solid catalyst. Initially, oxidation of cyclooctane was performed in inert atmosphere (nitrogen gas) under identical conditions as shown in Table 1. The analysis of the reaction mixture revealed the absence of oxidized products and unreacted cyclooctane was recovered. This experiment suggests that the oxygen is acting as a real oxidant and the oxidation products formed under the present experimental conditions derived from molecular oxygen. Later, two more blank runs were carried out with TEMPO and p-benzoquinone as radical quenchers under similar reaction conditions. Negligible conversion of cyclooctane was observed in these two experiments which indicate that the reaction proceeds via radical mechanism. The observed results are summarized in Scheme 1 . Recently, TBAB has been employed as a convenient organocatalyst for alcohol oxidations using TBHP or NaClO as oxidants [49,50]. In the present work, the optimization results indicate that the combination of TBAB and Fe(BTC) efficiently accelerates the rate of aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane compared to either with Fe(BTC) or TBAB. Hence, a probable mechanism is proposed for the conversion of cyclooctane to cyclooctanol and cyclooctanone using TBAB and Fe(BTC) as catalyst (Scheme 2 ). The partial reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ occurs in Fe(BTC) in the presence of TBAB. This partially reduced Fe2+ is re-oxidized back to Fe3+ by the assistance of oxygen with simultaneous reduction of oxygen to superoxide radical. This highly reactive oxygen radical species react with cyclooctane to produce the corresponding hydroperoxide which further gives rise to cyclooctanol and cyclooctanone as primary oxidation products. Table 2 provides a comparison of the catalytic data obtained with Fe(BTC)/TBAB catalyst with earlier reports in the literature for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane. The present catalytic system distinctly differs from these reports in terms of avoiding the use of radical initiators, using molecular oxygen as an oxidant, employing lower reaction temperature, no requirement of noble metals, high conversion and high ol/one selectivity. As commented earlier, one of the long standing goals in this field is to develop catalysts that can promote aerobic oxidation of cycloalkanes. In this aspect, the present work showcases high activity, selectivity as well as good stability thus enabling Fe(BTC) and TBAB as a potential material for the liquid-phase aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane to cyclooctanol and cyclooctanone. Reusability experiments are very often performed in heterogeneous catalysis to establish the stability under optimized experimental conditions. In this context, aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane was performed using Fe(BTC) as catalyst under optimized conditions as shown in Table 1. After the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed and dried. This catalyst was reused in the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane under same conditions as followed in Table 1. The observed catalytic results revealed that Fe(BTC) can be reused for two cycles with no significant decay in conversion of cyclooctane and ol/one selectivity. However, the observed minor decrease in the conversion and selectivity after two recycles may be due to the catalyst loss during the recovery and reusability tests. Furthermore, the reusability data suggested that Fe(BTC) is stable under the reaction conditions. On the other hand, the stability of Fe(BTC) MOF was further validated by comparing the fresh and two times reused Fe(BTC) samples by powder XRD, SEM and FT-IR analysis. Fig. 6 provides powder XRD patterns of fresh, recovered and two times reused Fe(BTC) samples. Comparison of the fresh Fe(BTC) with the recovered and two times reused material indicates that the semi-crystallinity of Fe(BTC) is maintained during the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane. In addition, the intensity of the peaks is also retained in the recovered and reused samples compared to those of fresh Fe(BTC) sample. Fig. 7 shows SEM images of the fresh and two times reused Fe(BTC) solids. These images suggest that the morphology of two times reused Fe(BTC) MOF undergoes some changes during the process of the oxidation reaction, but however, this modification did not affect the catalytic activity. This observation is also in agreement with earlier report using Fe(BTC) for the cyclization of bis-naphthol [52]. Furthermore, comparison of the fresh and two times reused Fe(BTC) by FT-IR spectra indicate that there are no additional stretching frequencies in the reused MOF during the course of the reaction (Fig. 8 ). However, the intensity of the carbonyl stretching frequency around 1705 cm−1 has increased in the reused sample. This was attributed due to the adsorption of the cyclooctanone over Fe(BTC) solid. This experimental observation coincides with an earlier result of the reused Fe(BTC) [52]. These interesting results observed for the aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane encouraged us to expand the scope of this catalyst with other linear hydrocarbons under identical reaction conditions. The observed results are shown in Table 3 . The aerobic oxidation of n-dodecane exhibited 6% conversion with the combined selectivity of ol/one to 88% after 24 h at 120 °C. On the other hand, n-decane resulted in 7% conversion with ol/one selectivity of 94% under identical conditions. N-Nonane and n-octane showed 8% conversions with 97% selectivity to ol/ones, respectively under identical conditions. The analysis of the reaction mixture by gas chromatography indicates that the methyl group in these hydrocarbons is not oxidized. These results are in good agreement with earlier reports [31,32]. 4 Conclusions In this work, we have shown that Fe(BTC) can be employed as heterogeneous solid catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of cycloalkane and linear alkanes without the use of radical initiators or peroxides. Fe(BTC) was able to efficiently convert cyclooctane to its corresponding ol/one reaching a conversion of 73% at 84% selectivity after 24 h at 120 °C under aerobic conditions. Fe(BTC) was recycled for two reuses with no significant decay in its activity and selectivity. Further, leaching experiments proved the heterogeneity of the reaction and ICP-OES analysis indicated the absence of iron leaching under the present experimental conditions. The Fe(BTC) stability was confirmed by comparing the fresh and two times reused samples by powder XRD, SEM and FT-IR analysis and suggesting no significant changes from these analyses. This method was also extended to oxidize linear hydrocarbons to their corresponding ol/ones with selectivity ranging between 88–97 %. Some of the advantages of this method are achieving >90% selectivity of ol/one at a conversion of around 20%, using molecular oxygen as oxidant, absence of radical initiators/peroxides and operating under mild reaction conditions.

        "dc:description": "Aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons is one of the research fronts in organic chemistry as well as in chemical engineering. In this aspect, many efforts are devoted to develop heterogeneous catalysts that can convert hydrocarbon to its corresponding alcohol/ketone (ol/one) with selectivity more than 90%. However, achieving this target becomes difficult due to possible secondary reactions of initially formed ol/one mixture. Hence, this study aims to report the catalytic activity of Fe(BTC) (BTC: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) in aerobic oxidation of cyclooctane at 73% conversion to its respective ol/one with 84% selectivity after 24 h at 120 °C in the absence of any radical initiators. Interestingly, the selectivity of ol/one is higher than 90% at cyclooctane conversion around 20% under present reaction conditions. Reusability and leaching experiments demonstrate the stability of Fe(BTC) during the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the present catalytic system can also be extended to oxidize other linear hydrocarbons to their respective ol/one products with the selectivity ranging between 88–97 %.",
