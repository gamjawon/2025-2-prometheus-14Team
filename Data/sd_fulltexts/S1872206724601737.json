ABSTRACT Storing solar energy in battery systems is crucial to achieving a green and sustainable society. However, the efficient development of photo-enhanced zinc-air batteries (ZABs) is limited by the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers on the photocathode. In this work, the visible-light-driven CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst with unique petal-like layer structure was designed and developed, which can be used as air electrode for visible-light-driven ZABs. The superior performance of ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was mainly attributed to the successful construction of Schottky heterojunction between g-C3N4 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which accelerates the transfer of electrons from g-C3N4 to CoS2/CuS cocatalysts, improves the carrier separation ability, and extends the carrier lifetime. Thereinto, the visible-driven ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst has a power density of 588.90 mW cm–2 and a charge-discharge cycle of 643 h under visible light irradiation, which is the highest performance ever reported for photo-enhanced ZABs. More importantly, the charge-discharge voltage drop of ZABs was only 0.54 V under visible light irradiation, which is significantly lower than the voltage drop (0.94 V) in the dark. This study provides a new idea for designing efficient and stable visible-light-driven ZABs cathode catalysts. Graphical Abstract The visible-light-driven Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 exhibited the highest peak power density ever recorded (588.90 mW cm–2) and a long charge-discharge cycle (643 h). Keywords Visible-light-driven CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst Zinc-air battery Heterojunction Photogenerated carriers 1 Introduction In the midst of growing global environmental problems and increasing energy demand, research on renewable energy technologies is becoming increasingly complex and reliable. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have become a hot topic in future energy research owing to their high theoretical energy density (1086 Wh kg−1), abundant reserves of zinc in the Earth's crust, easy recovery, low cost, environmental protection, safety, and reliability [1,2]. However, the slow ORR and OER kinetic processes on the air electrode lead to its low energy efficiency, which is currently the main bottleneck for the large-scale commercial application of ZABs [3–5]. Solar energy, as one of the renewable energy sources, has the characteristics of environmental protection, safety, and unrestricted transportation and storage, and has a profound impact on the sustained and rapid development of society. In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of scientific research on the integration of solar energy and energy storage systems [3,5,6], which requires the rational integration of these two energy systems to theoretically meet the functional integrity of clean energy and energy conservation and emission reduction [7,8]. In some reported studies, Zinc-air batteries or Li-O2 batteries have been successfully loaded with photoelectrodes, in which photogenerated carriers are created in order to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to offset the energy needed for discharging and charging the battery [4–6,8–15]. Due to zinc being more chemically inert, having richer reserves, and being cheaper than lithium, photo-enhanced ZABs have become another candidate for energy storage systems and have received more extensive research [8,16]. Photo-enhanced ZABs consist of a photocathode with photo response and oxygen reduction catalytic activity, a zinc electrode, and alkaline electrolyte [17,18]. The current research on photocathodes used for photo-enhanced ZABs mainly have focused on g-C3N4/CuZIF-67 [3], α-MnO2 [14], ZnO/CuO [13], P150-20/TiO2 [6], TiO2@In2Se3@Ag3PO4 [5], BiVO4/V2O5 [11] and MoS2-ONT [8] to achieve low charging potential. However, in order to obtain continuously working photo-enhanced ZABs, there are still problems of rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in photocathode and short carrier lifetime, especially in obtaining high-power-density photo-enhanced ZABs. Therefore, how to effectively avoid the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and ensure the continuous action of electrons and holes in the charge-discharge process of photo-enhanced ZABs is still a challenging problem. The construction of Schottky heterojunctions, which consist of semiconductors and metal-like materials, is considered to be an effective solution for inhibiting the rapid recombination of electron and hole pairs [19–22]. N-type semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a photo-active material with a small band gap (~2.7 eV), low cost, good stability, and easy preparation, providing a favorable pathway for various energy and environmental photocatalytic applications [17,23–31]. However, monomeric g-C3N4 still suffers from poor visible light utilization and fast photogenerated carrier recombination [32,33]. In recent years, the construction of Schottky heterojunction materials with g-C3N4 and metal-like materials (carbon materials, metal sulfides, etc.) has been studied in H2 evolution [34–37], pollutant degradation [4,38] and other fields. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to their unique physical and chemical properties such as high work function (4−5 eV), low electrical resistivity, high thermal conductivity, and large surface area, can form Schottky heterojunctions with g-C3N4, suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs, and enhance carrier lifetime [34,39–45]. Moreover, the photoelectrode of highly efficient photo-enhanced ZABs should also have the addition of bifunctional oxygen reaction activity cocatalysts. Among many bifunctional ORR/OER cocatalysts, metal sulfide, especially cobalt sulfide (CoS x ), has received more and more attention due to its good electrical conductivity and activity [36,46,47]. However, the oxidation and activity decay in alkaline electrolytes still limit the further application of CoS x as a bifunctional catalyst for ZABs. In order to improve the stability of CoS x and alleviate its photocorrosion, many materials such as FeS2, NiS2, and C3N4 are combined with CoS x to prevent surface oxidation [47–49]. In addition, the research team led by Nath proposes that the incorporation of copper with high-occupied D-bands can enhance the conductivity of the catalyst, facilitate charge transfer on the surface of the electrocatalyst, and augment the performance of metal-based electrocatalysts [34]. Indeed, bimetallic heterojunction cocatalysts exhibit a number of distinctive advantages. These advantages include: (1) the provision of a greater abundance of active sites; (2) the regulation of the state density of the Fermi level in the metal position, thereby enabling the alteration of its intrinsic properties; (3) the modification of catalytic Gibbs free energy [50–52]. Inspired by these considerations, in this work, a petal-like photocatalyst with visible light response was designed and prepared by coupling g-C3N4 with CNTs to construct Schottky heterojunction and supporting oxygen cocatalyst CoS2/CuS (denoted as CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4). The unique petal-like structure had a larger specific surface area and stronger light absorption capacity, which could provide more active sites for the charge-discharge process under visible light irradiation, and was conducive to the diffusion and transport of oxygen reaction intermediates. g-C3N4 not only enhanced light absorption as a light collector, but also provided photogenerated electrons and holes for the charge-discharge process and participated in the oxygen reaction process. In addition, the heterojunction construction in CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 improved the carrier separation efficiency, prolonged the carrier lifetime, promoted ORR and OER in the charge-discharge process, and thus obtained photo-enhanced ZABs with high charge-discharge performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, sulfur powder, ethanol, and ammonia (purity: 25.0%–28.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Company. Carbon nanotubes (purity: > 98 wt%, diameter 10–20 nm) were provided by Chengdu Organic Nano Co., Ltd. (China). All chemicals are used as received and do not require further purification. 2.2 Synthesis g-C3N4 nanosheets was synthesized from calcinating urea at 550 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1. Compared with other works [1,2], we have successfully prepared layered g-C3N4 (Figs. S1–S3) Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (582 mg) and copper nitrate hexahydrate (242 mg) were dissolved in 30 mL deionized (DI) water, 5 mL absolute ethanol and 1 mL ammonia. Sulfur powder (1000 mg) was added in the mixed solution and stirred for 30 min. Then, g-C3N4 nanosheets (50 mg) and CNTs (50 mg) were dropped into the prepared mixture and transferred to a reaction vessel lined with polytetrafluoroethylene (50 mL) for 6 hours at 160 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the compound powder was obtained by centrifugation and washing three times with DI water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively. Finally, the compound powder was subjected to N2 atmosphere and heated at a rate of 3 °C min–1 to 350 °C for 1 h of pyrolysis. The final product was named CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4. According to the same preparation method, CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT are prepared without adding cupric nitrate hexahydrate and g-C3N4, respectively. According to the same preparation method, CoS2/CuS-C3N4 was prepared without adding CNTs. 2.3 Material characterizations The microstructural characteristics of these materials were performed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI Sirion 200) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) (JEOL JEM-2100F). The structure of the spinel samples was measured at X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/MAX-2550 PC). In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were obtained from a high-performance electron spectrometer (RBD-upgraded PHIe5000C ECSA system). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples were achieved on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV2450) from 200 to 800 nm wavelength at room temperature. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at 385 nm (LS50B, PerkinElmer, Inc, USA). Under the excitation of a hydrogen flash lamp with a wavelength of 325 nm (nF900; Edinburgh Instruments), the time-resolved decay curve of the sample was recorded using an FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). 2.4 Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical tests A series of electrochemical properties of the photocatalysts were tested using a three-electrode CHI760d electrochemical workstation. Before the electrochemical performance test, the catalyst ink was prepared by adding 4 mg catalyst powder into the mixed solution composed of 200 μL isopropyl alcohol and 800 μL 0.1 wt% Nafion. After ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, a uniform suspended solution was formed. Apply ink (9.4 μL) rotary droplets onto a glassy carbon, electrode with an area of 0.19625 cm2, with a catalyst loading of 200 µg cm–1 as the working electrode, and platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The potential E (SCE) was converted to the potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.2415 + 0.0591 × pH. To explore the photoelectrochemical performance of the catalysts, the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) capacities were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an O2-saturated 0.1 mol L–1 KOH solution in the dark and under visible light irradiation, respectively. The lighting source is a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter (light intensity: 100 mW cm–2). The band gap was appraised by Mott-Schottky test in 0.5 mol L–1 Na2SO4 with frequency of 1 kHz. The electron transfer number (n) was acquired by a glassy carbon, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) at 10 mV s−1 scan rate and rotating speed of 1600 r min–1, then n was calculated by the following equation. (1) n = 4 × i d/(i d + i r/N) (i r: the ring current, i d: the disk current, and N: the current collection efficiency, 0.37). 2.5 Fabrication and testing of photo-enhanced ZABs Zinc plates and 6 mol L–1 KOH were used as anode and electrolyte for photo-enhanced ZABs, respectively. 30 mg catalyst was dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous ethanol and 5 wt% Nafion solution (110 μL), ultrasonic for 50 min, and configured into ink. Finally, spray the ink on the Carbon, paper base (spraying area: 1 × 1 cm2). The charge-discharge performance of a photo-enhanced ZABs was studied by means of flow mechanics with a current density of 10 mA cm–2, which was kept for 10 min per cycle (discharging 5 min, charging 5 min) under visible light irradiation and in the dark, respectively. Based on discharge current (I), test period (t) and weight of zinc consumed (W Zn), the specific capacity is calculated according to the following formula: (2) Specific capacity ( mAh g - 1 ) = I × t W Zn 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization results The preparation method of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 1(a) . We first prepared composite powders using hydrothermal method, and then obtained the final product by high-temperature calcination in N2 atmosphere (denoted as CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4). The SEM images inFigs. 1(b), (c) and Fig. S4 showed that CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 exhibited a unique petal-like layered structure. Nevertheless, CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT exhibited obvious spherical agglomerations (Figs. S5, S6). In SEM images of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (Fig. S5), the Co-based sulfides were clustered into irregular spheres, and the CNTs were interspersed with the Co-based sulfides and stacked together on the g-C3N4 sheet. Compared with SEM images of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 (Figs. 1(b), (c)), it was showed that the doping of Cu can reduce the aggregation of Co-based sulfides, making them layered. In addition, (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. S6) exhibited a denser sphericity, which also suggested that g-C3N4 acted not only as a light collector, but also as a dispersant for metal sulfides. It is worth noting that TEM images inFigs. 1(d), (e) and Fig. S7 showed that CoS2/CuS, CNT, and g-C3N4 were distributed in petal-like spherical structures, in which CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (Fig. S8) and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. S9) primarily consisted of irregularly-shaped massive metal sulfides and CNTs. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 1(f)), three crystal phases were observed on g-C3N4 nanosheets with lattice spacing of 0.374, 0.277 and 0.281 nm, respectively, which could be allocated to the (102) plane of g-C3N4 (JCPDS 87-1526), the (200) plane of CoS2 (JCPDS 89-1492), and the (103) plane of CuS (JCPDS 78-2121), respectively. Through TEM and HRTEM observation, it can be concluded that CoS2, CuS and CNTs were successfully loaded on the surface of g-C3N4. The element mapping images (Fig. 1(g) and Fig. S10) revealed that the uniform distribution of Co, Cu, S, C and N elements in the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst was observed. In summary, the doping of Cu and g-C3N4 is essential for the formation of petal-like layered structures. The unique petal-like layered structure can increase the specific surface area of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst, provide more active sites, accelerate the mass transfer rate, and effectively improve the ORR and OER properties driven by visible light. XRD was used to obtain the crystal structure of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4. Fig. 2(a) showed the XRD patterns of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4, which could be denoted as CoS2 (PDF # 89-1492) and CuS (PDF # 78-2121), respectively. Quantitative analysis by XRD showed that the contents of CoS2 and CuS were 46.9 wt% and 53.1 wt%, respectively (Fig. S11). The diffraction peak at 26.1 degrees is indicative of the presence of the (002) surface (graphitized structure) in CNTs and g-C3N4 [53]. Compared with the XRD patterns of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. S12), the results further confirmed the successful preparation of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst. All samples exhibited type-IV isotherm with a wide pore structure (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S13). The BET surface area of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was 583 m2 g−1, which was obviously higher than that of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (436 m2 g−1) and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT (367 m2 g−1). This is mainly due to the unique petal-like morphology of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4, which is consistent with SEM and TEM results (Figs. S4−S9), and further indicate that doping of Cu and g-C3N4 can improve the specific surface area of the catalyst and provide more active sites. The Raman I D/I G ratio of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 (1.06) was higher than that of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (1.01) and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT (1.00) (Fig. 2(c)), indicating that the doping of Cu could introduce carbon defects, which are generally considered more active than the original carbon [54–56]. Simultaneously, we used XPS to analyze the elemental composition and electronic structure of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst in more detail (Fig. S14). When deconvolved, the C 1s spectrum of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 (Fig. 2(d)) can be separated into four peaks at 284.6, 285.6, 286.6, and 288.6 eV, representing C=C–C, C–N, C–O, and C=O, respectively. Compared with CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (Fig. S15(a)) and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. S16(a)), the C 1s spectrum of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 had the strongest C=O peak, indicating that CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 had a more excellent oxygen adsorption capacity. The N 1s spectra of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4, CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. 2(e), Fig. S15(b) and Fig. S16(b)) can be deconvoluted into two peaks of 399.0 and 401 eV, corresponding to pyridine N and graphite N, respectively [57–61]. Pyridine N and graphite N have been widely reported to promote ORR activity [53,61,62]. The deconvolution of the O 1s spectra from these hybrid materials (Fig. 2(f), Fig. S15(c) and Fig. S16(c)) can reveal two peaks at 531.7 and 532.7 eV, suggesting the presence of oxygen vacancies and surface-bound water molecules [34,63], respectively. As previously discussed [33], S dopants can either replace lattice O as defects, fill vacancies in defective O in the cubic phase, or fulfill both roles. The presence of lattice defects can alter the local electronic structure of hybrid materials. Substituting S with an ideal alternative can generate additional active sites, improving the kinetics of both ORR and OER [33,38,46,47]. The S 2p spectrum of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst (Fig. 2(g)) can be deconvolved to S 2p 3/2 (162.9 eV), S 2p 1/2 (164.1 eV) and the surface metal sulfide oxide SO x 2− (169 and 170.2 eV), while in the CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 catalyst, the strong peak strength of SO x 2− was due to the large presence of the metal sulfide Co(SO4)2 (Figs. S15(d) and S16(d)). It also showed that the doping of Cu can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Co-based sulfide to SO x 2−, so that more metal ions in the catalyst existed in the form of metal sulfide CoS2, which promoted an increase in (photo)electrochemical oxygen reactivity. The XPS analysis demonstrated that sulfur powder effectively established covalent bonds with g-C3N4 and CNTs, creating N and S co-doped carbon frameworks. Specifically, the Cu 2p spectrum in CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT reveals six corresponding peaks: Cu+ (932.5 and 952.3 eV), Cu2+ (934.5 and 955.3 eV), and two vibrational satellite peaks (945.1 and 963.3 eV) (Fig. 2 (h) and Fig. S16(e)) [3,12]. In addition, the six fitted peaks in the Co 2p spectra of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4, CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT (Fig. 2(i), Figs. S15(e) and S16(f)) were Co2+ (780.6 and 797.5 eV), Co3+ (779.1 and 794.3 eV), and two vibrational satellite peaks (784.0 and 803.6 eV) [64,65], respectively. Compared with the Co 2p spectra of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (Fig. S15(e)), the doping of Cu increased the peak intensity of Co3+ in CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 and decreased the peak intensity of Co2+ (Fig. 2(i)). It is important to mention that Co3+ is in a very reactive spin state and can attract and donate electrons, thus enhancing the performance of the ORR [64]. These results revealed a significant interaction between Cu and Co, confirming the successful synthesis of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst. 3.2 Photoelectrochemical performance test Considering the unique structure of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst, it is expected that the as-prepared CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst can serve as good candidate catalysts for reversible ORR and OER. We first investigate the ORR properties of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4, CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 and (Cu,Co)3OS3@CNT in O2-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH under visible light irradiation and in the dark, respectively. As shown in Figs. S17−S19, the doping of Cu and g-C3N4 enhanced the (photo)electrochemical ORR performance of Co-based sulfide, in which the introduction of visible light further reduced the interfacial charge transfer resistance of the hybrid material and improved the ORR reaction kinetics. Under visible light irradiation, the half-wave potential of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 (E 1/2 = 0.84 V) was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (E 1/2 = 0.85 V) (Figs. 3(a ), (b)), and was superior to the half-wave potentials of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (E 1/2 = 0.82 V) and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT (E 1/2 = 0.80 V) (Fig. S17), as well as most other non-Pt-based photocatalysts reported so far (Table S1). Meanwhile, the dynamic current density (j k) calculated to represent the intrinsic activity of electrocatalyst was 4.89 mA cm−2 under visible light irradiation for CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 at 0.85 V, which was better than 3.08 mA cm−2 in the dark and comparable to that of Pt/C (4.90 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the Tafel slope is crucial for assessing the reaction kinetics of catalysts, in which a smaller Tafel slope is advantageous for the electrocatalytic process [66]. The Tafel slope of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation (54.82 mV dec−1) was lower than that in the dark (74.68 mV dec−1), and even lower than that of benchmark Pt/C catalyst (96.64 mV dec−1) (Fig. S20). This further highlighted the excellent photoelectrochemical ORR properties of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst. Simultaneously, compared with Pt/C catalyst, the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst had lower interfacial charge transfer resistance and faster ORR kinetics. The introduction of visible light further reduced the interfacial charge transfer resistance of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst, improved the ORR kinetics, and helped to improve the photoelectrochemical ORR performance (Figs. S20, S21). Measurements of the rotating ring electrode showed an H2O2 yield of less than 1.3% and an average electron transfer number (n) of 3.98 (Fig. 3(c)). According to the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) diagram of the rotating disk electrode curve in the range of 625 to 2025 r min−1, the average value of n was about 3.95 (Fig. S22). These results indicated that CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical ORR activity and a highly efficient 4e− ORR pathway under alkaline conditions. In addition to exhibiting highly photoelectrochemical activity towards ORR, the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst also exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical activity towards OER. Fig. 3(d) showed the OER polarization curves of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 and IrO2 in an O2-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution. The CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst required only 0.47 V (Ej =10) overpotential under visible light irradiation to provide a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(e)), which was lower than its required overpotential value in the dark (0.54 V), and comparable to the overpotential values required by state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts (0.36 V) and many reported non-precious metal-based OER photoelectrochemical catalysts (Table S1). As shown inFigs. 3(d), 3(e) and Fig. S23, the doping of Cu improved the electrochemical OER performance of Co-based sulfides, while the introduction of the photo collector (g-C3N4) further enhanced the photoelectrochemical OER performance of metal sulfides. The reversible potential difference (ΔE) of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 as ORR/OER catalysts for oxygen reaction under visible light irradiation was only 0.86 V, where Ej =10 and E 1/2 of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 were 1.70 and 0.84 V, respectively. It can be seen that the as-prepared CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst had excellent photoelectrochemical oxygen reactivity and bifunctional reversibility, and had broad application prospects in zinc-air batteries. At the same time, the impedance arc diameter of the as-prepared CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation was smaller than that in the dark and IrO2, indicating that the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst had excellent photogenerated carrier separation and transport properties (Fig. S24) [5]. The fitted Tafel curve (Fig. 3(f)) showed that the slope of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 under visible light irradiation (81.69 mV dec−1) was much smaller than that of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 in the dark (122.28 mV dec−1) and IrO2 (142.39 mV dec−1), significantly better than the slopes of CoS2/Co(SO4)2@CNT-C3N4 (100.00 mV dec−1) and (Cu, Co)3OS3@CNT (102.32 mV dec−1) under visible light irradiation (Fig. S25). The Tafel slope of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was the smallest, indicating that the first discharge step controls the reaction kinetics of OER (i.e. the formation of OHads intermediates) [67]. Therefore, based on the excellent bifunctional photoelectrochemical properties and physical characterization results, the highly photoelectrochemical ORR/OER performance of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 is due to the following reasons: (1) the doping of Cu promotes the formation of unique petal-like layered structures, increases the specific surface area, enhances the mass transfer efficiency and exposes more active sites; (2) under visible light irradiation, g-C3N4 acts as a photosensitizer to produce photogenerated electrons and holes, participate in ORR and OER processes, and accelerate oxygen reaction kinetics. 3.3 Photoelectrochemical performance tests Inspired by its excellent ORR and OER performance, CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was first used to assemble photoelectrochemical ZABs and its practical application in energy storage equipment was explored (Fig. 4(a) ). Fig. 4(b) showed that the open circuit voltage of ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 under visible light irradiation was 1.510 V, which was higher than that in the dark (1.368 V), mainly because the photogenerated electrons and holes generated by photoelectrodes under visible light irradiation fully participated in the ORR/OER process. In addition, ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 also exhibited higher discharge voltages under visible light irradiation than that in the dark. In particular, the discharge voltage did not change when it decreased from 50 to 5 mA cm−2, indicating that CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst had good reversibility (Fig. 4(c)). The specific discharge capacity of ZABs assembled by the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst under visible light and in the dark was studied by using the 10 mA cm−2 constant current discharge method in the Blue Power system (Fig. 4(d)). It can be seen that the specific discharge capacity under visible light irradiation was 775 mAh gZn −1, which was higher than that in the dark (721 mAh gZn −1). As shown in Fig. 4(e), the peak power density of the ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 under visible light irradiation was 588.90 mW cm−2 at 870 mA cm−2, which was higher than the peak power density in the dark (444.47 mW cm−2 and 835 mA cm−2), and was superior to the Pt/C + IrO2-based ZABs (189.07 mW cm−2 and 221.7 mA cm−2) and reported bifunctional photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical ZABs (Table S1). The charge-discharge stability of ZABs is an important index to measure the practical application potential of the catalyst. To evaluate the long-term cycle stability of ZABs, photoelectrochemical ZABs assembled by the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst was subjected to a constant current charge-discharge cycle under visible light irradiation and in the dark, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(f), the photoelectrochemical ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 had no significant fluctuation in charge and discharge for 643 hours (~3800 cycles) at constant current (10 mA cm−2), and the charge-discharge voltage drop was only 0.54 V, which was significantly lower than the charge-discharge voltage drop in the dark (0.94 V). It is worth mentioning that, compared with the reported photoelectrochemical ZABs (Fig. 4(g)) and the state-of-the-art ZABs (Table S1), the visible-light-driven ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 showed the highest peak power density and the longest charge-discharge stability reported in history. Therefore, the photoelectric coupling mechanism reduces the activation energy of the oxygen reaction, the unique petal-like layer structure provides more active sites, and doping modification improves the ORR/OER reaction kinetics, which are the main reasons for the excellent performance of photoelectrochemical ZABs. 3.4 Study on photoelectrochemical ORR/OER mechanism In order to emphasize the important role of CNTs in the construction of Schottky heterostructures with g-C3N4, CoS2/CuS-C3N4 samples are added to facilitate the exploration of the photoelectrochemical oxygen reaction mechanism of the CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst. Fig. 5(a) showed the results of the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer for g-C3N4, CoS2/CuS-C3N4 and CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4. As can be seen from Fig. 5(a), g-C3N4 had a high UV light absorption capacity, and the modification of metal sulfides (CoS2/CuS-C3N4) successfully expanded the light absorption range of g-C3N4 from UV light to visible light, while the modification of CNTs (CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4) further enhanced the absorption intensity of visible light. This also indicated the successful construction of the visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical ZABs system. According to the following Kubelka-Munk equation (Eq. (3)), the diffuse reflection coefficient was calculated, and the bandgap (E g) of g-C3N4 was approximately 2.77 eV (Fig. S26). (3) αhν = B(hν – E g)1/2 where hv represents the discrete photon energy, B represents the material constant, alpha (α) can be determined using the diffuse reflection coefficient in the Kubelka-Munk equation. As depicted in Fig. 5(b), Mott-Schottky measurements were performed to confirm the semiconductor type of g-C3N4 prepared. g-C3N4 exhibited a positive slope characteristic of N-type semiconductor in the Mott-Schottky plot (Fig. 5(b)). The flat-band potential (E fb) of g-C3N4 was determined by extrapolating 1/C 2 to 0, and for g-C3N4, it was estimated at –1.24 V vs. NHE. In N-type semiconductors, the conduction band (CB) lies 0.1 to 0.3 eV above the E fb, depending on the mass and concentration of active electrons [53]. Hence, to estimate the CB position of g-C3N4, a potential difference of 0.2 eV between the CB and E fb was considered. Therefore, we obtained that the CB value of the original g-C3N4 was –1.04, corresponding to a valence band (VB) value of approximately 1.73 eV. In order to reveal the structural advantages of CNTs and metal sulfide (CoS2/CuS) in enhancing carrier separation kinetics, the photoelectric response characteristics of g-C3N4, CoS2/CuS-C3N4 and CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 were measured by I-t curves. In Fig. 5(c), compared with g-C3N4 and CoS2/CuS-C3N4, CoS2/CuS@ CNT-C3N4 exhibited a stronger photocurrent intensity, indicating that CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 had a higher carrier separation efficiency, which was consistent with the obvious quenching of steady-state PL intensity in Fig. 5(d). Moreover, the photocurrent response of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was tested for 5 consecutive switching photocycles, and the photocurrent value remained unchanged, indicating that it had good photostability and photoelectric response performance [68,69]. The results showed that this strong carrier separation efficiency was due to the successful construction of the Schottky heterojunction between g-C3N4 and CNTs, which can effectively reduce the photogenerated electron-hole pairs recombination behavior while metal sulfide (CoS2/CuS) acts as the cocatalyst of the oxygen reaction. To further confirm the above analysis, three different photocatalysts were measured using time-resolved fluorescence method, and the average lifetime can be calculated according to the following formula (Eq. (4)) [36,70]: (4) ( τ ) = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 + A 3 τ 3 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 + A 3 τ 3 where A is the corresponding amplitude and τ is the PL emission lifetime of a given state (Table S2). As shown in Fig. 5(e), it should be noted that the mean PL lifetimes of g-C3N4, CoS2CuS-C3N4 and CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 measured by time-resolved PL spectra were 2.76, 7.32 and 27.32 ns, respectively. The modification of CNTs had a positive effect on inhibiting photogenerated carriers recombination and prolonging the carrier lifetime, mainly due to the establishment of Schottky heterojunction between g-C3N4 and CNTs. At the same time, when the photocatalyst is excited by light, the incident light is refracted several times in the CNTs, which will reduce the probability of electron and hole recombination [8,71]. In summary, these results further indicated that CNTs, as an electronic tunnel, constructed Schottky heterojunction with g-C3N4, enabling photogenerated electrons to be transferred to cocatalyst CoS2/CuS and then participated in the ORR process. Theoretical calculations and the proposed band structure can elucidate the improved efficiency of ZABs constructed with CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 when exposed to visible light. After the formation of Schottky junction between g-C3N4 and CNTs, CNTs, as an electron channel, accelerated the transfer of photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4 to cocatalyst CoS2/CuS, effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, we performed surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection (ATR-SEIRAS) analysis (Fig. S27). When the applied potential increased from open-circuit voltage (OCP) to 1.6 V, a peak representing the *O–O* intermediate was observed at 1160 cm–1 on the CoS2CuS@CNT-C3N4 catalyst, which represents the oxygen bridge intermediate on the dual site. As the voltage increases, peaks gradually appear at 1468 cm–1, representing the O–O* intermediate, which is the intermediate before the release of O2 [72]. This result further confirms that the photogenerated holes generated by the catalyst under visible light irradiation oxidize OH– for OER process. Based on these findings, the band structure of CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was proposed, as shown in Fig. 5(f). When N-type g-C3N4 was exposed to visible light, photons collided with its valence band (VB), generating electron-hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons were then excited from the VB to CB, while photogenerated holes remained in the VB (Eq. (5)). During the discharge of rechargeable ZABs, these photogenerated electrons were transferred to cocatalysts (CoS2/CuS) via electron tunnels (CNTs) to be involved in the ORR process (Eq. (6)) to reduce O2 and improved the electrochemical performance of ORR [3,73,74]. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes that gather in the VB of N-type g-C3N4 contributed to the OER process (Eq. (7)), as they oxidize OH– while the rechargeable ZABs were being charged, thereby boosting the electrochemical activity for the OER process [3,73,74]. Hence, the ORR and OER efficiency of photo-enhanced ZABs constructed with CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 is anticipated to be enhanced concurrently in the presence of visible light as opposed to in the dark, thanks to the heterojunction effect that aids in the separation of photogenerated carriers. Consequently, surplus electrons and holes generated by light were involved in the charge-discharge mechanisms, separately [3,75,76]. (5) CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 + hν → nh+ + ne− Discharging process: (6) Air cathode: O2 + 2H2O → 4OH− Charging process: (7) Air cathode: 4OH− + 4h+ → 2H2O + O2 4 Conclusions In summary, the petal-like CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst with Schottky heterostructure had been designed and fabricated. In the photocatalyst, a Schottky heterojunction was formed between g-C3N4 and CNTs, while CoS2/CuS was the cocatalyst of ORR. When CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was irradiated with visible light, photogenerated electrons generated by conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 were transferred to cocatalyst CoS2/CuS through electron tunnels (CNTs), which promoted ORR and increased the output voltage in the discharge process. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes in the VB of g-C3N4 promoted the OER, reducing the input voltage in the charge process. Therefore, this special Schottky heterostructure inhibited photogenerated carrier recombination and prolonged the carrier lifetime to promote ORR and OER. As a result, an unprecedented 1.26 V discharge voltage, 1.80 V charge voltage and a long-term charge and discharge cycle of 643 h (~3800 cycles) were obtained in the photo-enhanced ZABs, which was related to the additional photo contribution that can be converted into electrical energy in the discharge process and into chemical energy in the charge process. This work provides a feasible way to develop efficient and durable electrocatalysts for constructing ZABs driven by visible light.

        "dc:description": "ABSTRACT Storing solar energy in battery systems is crucial to achieving a green and sustainable society. However, the efficient development of photo-enhanced zinc-air batteries (ZABs) is limited by the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers on the photocathode. In this work, the visible-light-driven CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst with unique petal-like layer structure was designed and developed, which can be used as air electrode for visible-light-driven ZABs. The superior performance of ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 was mainly attributed to the successful construction of Schottky heterojunction between g-C3N4 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which accelerates the transfer of electrons from g-C3N4 to CoS2/CuS cocatalysts, improves the carrier separation ability, and extends the carrier lifetime. Thereinto, the visible-driven ZABs assembled by CoS2/CuS@CNT-C3N4 photocatalyst has a power density of 588.90 mW cm–2 and a charge-discharge cycle of 643 h under visible light irradiation, which is the highest performance ever reported for photo-enhanced ZABs. More importantly, the charge-discharge voltage drop of ZABs was only 0.54 V under visible light irradiation, which is significantly lower than the voltage drop (0.94 V) in the dark. This study provides a new idea for designing efficient and stable visible-light-driven ZABs cathode catalysts.",
