Graphical abstract Regulating the reactivity of nucleophiles is important in synthetic chemistry. As a weaker nucleophile is also a stronger Brønsted acid, it can be selectively deprotonated by a Brønsted base to give an anionic species that shows higher reactivity. Following this idea, the reactivity of nucleophiles can be controlled by using an appropriate Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst. Cuprous/aminolithium catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of acrylonitrile with an alcohol and an amine were chosen as model reactions. As the acidity of the alcohol is significantly higher than that of amine, the former is more easily deprotonated. Therefore, an alcohol shows higher reactivity than an amine in the presence of a Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst, reversing the selectivity trend. Keywords Inverse the chemoselectivity DFT calculations Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst Cuprous/aminolithium catalyst Introduction For over a century, nucleophilic addition has been one of the most reliable ways to construct new CC and CX (X N, O, S, P, and halogens) bonds, and it has been widely studied by organic chemists [1]. Classic organic reactions with nucleophilic attack as the key step, including the Aldol reaction, [2] Michael addition, [3] Claisen condensation, [4] and the Witting reaction, [5] form the basis of conventional synthetic organic chemistry. In this area, nucleophiles has attracted the focus of attention as a key parameter in reaction modulation. A nucleophile is an electron-rich molecule that contains a lone pair of electrons or a polarized bond, heterolysis of which can give a lone pair of electrons. Accordingly, alcohols, halides, amines, and phosphines with a lone pair of electrons can be considered typical nucleophiles. Generally, the nucleophilicity of the neutral main group atoms of the same row of the periodic table depends on the corresponding electronegativity. For example, the nucleophilicity of a typical amine is higher than that of the alcohol, because the electronegativity of nitrogen is lower than that of oxygen. The molecular charge on the nucleophile also can affect the nucleophilicity. For instance, the nucleophilicities of alkoxides and amides are higher than those of pre-deprotonated alcohols and amines. According to this idea, a common way to increase the nucleophilicity is by using an appropriate Brønsted base to deprotonate the alcohol or amine to give the corresponding alkoxide or amide. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot change the order of the nucleophilicity of nitrogen and oxygen. [6] Chemoselectivity is very important in nucleophilic attack, [7–9] especially when the attacking atom is nitrogen or oxygen, as it determines the design of many strategies. Therefore, controlled chemoselective nucleophilic attack has become the goal of many synthetic chemists. Notwithstanding, as the corresponding acidity order of the alcohol and amine groups is the opposite, an optimal catalytic amount of a Brønsted base can be used to react selectively with an alcohol to give the corresponding alkoxide, [6,10] which can override the nucleophilicity of a more reactive species, such as amine. This provides opportunities to devise approaches to reverse the nucleophilicity of two nucleophiles (Scheme 1 ). When both an alcohol and an amine simultaneously exist, the amine generally has priority as the nucleophile to attack the electrophile (E) in the construction of a new N bond (Scheme 1(a), left), because an amine has the larger local nucleophilic Parr functions (P k −) (Table S1 of the supplementary information (SI)). However, in the presence of an appropriate Brønsted base, the alcohol can be deprotonated first, and the resulting alkoxide countered by an extra Lewis acid through formation of the corresponding salt. As the nucleophilicity of the generated alkoxide is higher than that of the un-deprotonated neutral amine, it can react with the electrophile to achieve controllable O-attack. Although the controllability of nucleophilic attack can be qualitatively described, there is still a lack of quantitative evidences to verify this conjecture. Therefore, chemoselective addition of acrylonitrile in the presence of an alcohol and an amine reported by Ohshima and Yazaki [6] was chosen as the model reaction to study how an appropriate Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair changes the nucleophilicity. When a ternary mixture of an alcohol, an amine, and acrylonitrile was reacted under the catalyst-free condition, the hydroamination product was observed as the major product with greater than 99/1 chemoselectivity (Scheme 1(b)). [6] Alternatively, when a cuprous Lewis acid was used as a catalyst in the presence of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (Li-HMDS) as a Brønsted base, the observed product is changed to the corresponding ether by hydroxylation. In this study, density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the details of the chemoselectivity reversal in this cuprous-catalyzed nucleophilic addition reaction. Computational details All of the DFT calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 series of programs. [11] The B3LYP functional [12] was used for geometry optimization with the standard 6−31 G(d) [13] basis set (SDD [14] basis set for Cu). Harmonic vibrational frequency calculations of all of the stationary points were performed to confirm whether they are local minima or transition structures and to derive the thermochemical corrections for the enthalpies and free energies. The transition states were confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The single-point energies were calculated at the M06 [15]/6−311+G(d,p) (SDD basis set for Cu) level using the SMD [16] solvation model (solvent = tetrahydrofuran, THF). The solution translational entropy correction was calculated with the THERMO program, [17] which has been successfully applied to typical cyclization reactions [18] and transition-metal catalyzed reactions [19] to predict the activated entropy in solution. Although the entropy correction is a complicated issue [20] and not always necessary for transition-metal catalyzed reactions in solution [20], it indeed obtained more reasonable results in our model systems (Table S2 of SI). The energies reported in this paper are the M06 calculated Gibbs free energies in THF solvent corrected by THERMO program. The natural population analysis (NPA) charge and nucleophilic Parr functions (P k −) [21] were also computed at the same level of theory. The calculated three-dimensional stereoscopic structures were prepared using the CYL view [22]. Results and discussion According to our prediction, the nucleophilicity order of an alcohol and an amine would be reversed in the presence of a Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst. Therefore, we first focused on the catalytic cycle of cuprous/aminolithium catalyzed hydroxylation of acrylonitrile (Fig. 1 ). Diphosphine-coordinated amino cuprous 4 was chosen as the relative zero in the calculated free energy profiles, which can be generated by counterion exchange with aminolithium (Scheme S1 of SI). The amino group has strong Brønsted alkalinity, and it can react with benzyl alcohol 1 via transition state 7ts to achieve deprotonation of the hydroxyl group. The calculated energy barrier of the proton transfer process via a four-membered ring transition state 7ts is only 3.5 kcal/mol, which gives cuprous alkylate complex 8 with a N–H O hydrogen bond. Generation of a new Cu–O bond in complex 8 increases the nucleophilicity of the alkoxide. Therefore, electron-deficient acrylonitrile can insert into the Cu–O bond via four-membered ring transition state 18ts with an energy barrier of only 7.3 kcal/mol. After this step, alkyl cuprous intermediate 12 is formed, which is exergonic by 7.1 kcal/mol. Alternatively, cleavage of the N–H O hydrogen bond can give cuprous alkylate intermediate 10, which is endergonic by 3.2 kcal/mol. Cuprous alkoxide intermediate 10 can also undergo alkene insertion via four-membered ring transition state 11ts to afford the same intermediate 12. The calculated relative free energy of transition state 11ts is 2.6 kcal/mol higher than that of 18ts, so this pathway is unfavorable. An intermolecular nucleophilic attack pathway was also considered. Intermolecular nucleophilic attack transition state 19ts was located with a relative free energy of 10.1 kcal/mol, which is 3.9 kcal/mol higher than that of 18ts. Therefore, this pathway can be excluded. When alkyl cuprous intermediated 12 is formed, the Cu–C bond can be protonated by the amine to form 13. The intermediate 13 can isomerize to cuprous vinylidene imine 15 via four-membered ring transition state 14ts, and then intermediate 15 is isomerized to amino cuprous 16. DFT calculations showed that proton transfer can occur via four-membered ring Cu–N/N metathesis transition state 17ts. The calculated free energy of transition state 17ts is 7.8 kcal/mol, which is 14.9 kcal/mol higher than the lowest intermediate 12. Therefore, the proton transfer by bis(trimethylsilyl)amine is not easy to happen. In an alternative pathway, alkyl cuprous intermediate 12 can isomerize to cuprous vinylidene imine 21 via four-membered ring transition state 20ts. This process is endergonic by 7.1 kcal/mol. Protonation of cuprous vinylidene amide 21 would occur via six-membered ring transition state 22ts to give the same hydroxylated product 5. The calculated free energy of transition state 22ts is only 1.9 kcal/mol higher than that of 17ts. Therefore, it is considered to be an alternative way for the protonation process. The DFT calculations of the whole catalytic cycle clearly revealed that deprotonation of the alcohol is in exergonic balance, which increases the nucleophilicity of the oxygen atom. Therefore, nucleophilic attack leading to the insertion of electron-deficient acrylonitrile easily occurs. For comparison, we also calculated the relative free energy profiles of the corresponding hydroamination of acrylonitrile in the presence of the same Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst. The free energy profiles are shown in Fig. 2 . The reaction also starts from amino cuprous 4. When 4 reacts with benzyl amine 2, the energy barrier of the corresponding deprotonation of the N bond is 9.8 kcal/mol via transition state 23ts, which is 6.3 kcal/mol higher than that of deprotonation of the alcohol via transition state 7ts. Interestingly, generation of cuprous amino complex 24 is endergonic by 7.0 kcal/mol, which is different from the corresponding step of the alcohol. This can be attributed to the Brønsted acidity of alcohol being higher than that of the amine. Evidently, the nucleophilicity of the amide is also higher than that of the alkylate, so the free energy barrier of alkene insertion into the Cu–N bond via transition state 33ts is only 4.9 kcal/mol. However, the relative free energy of amino cuprous complex 24 is 7.0 kcal/mol higher than the relative zero, which leads to an overall activation free energy of 11.9 kcal/mol for this step. A DFT calculation clearly revealed that the relative free energy of transition state 33ts for alkene insertion into the Cu–N bond is 5.7 kcal/mol higher than that of transition state 18ts for the corresponding insertion into the Cu–O bond. Furthermore, breaking of the N–H N hydrogen bond results in amino cuprous intermediate 25, which is endergonic by 1.8 kcal/mol. Alkene insertion can also occur by this pathway with an overall activation free energy of 12.2 kcal/mol of 26ts, which is slightly higher than the corresponding process with the N–H N hydrogen bond. An intermolecular nucleophilic attack pathway was also considered via transition state 34ts, whose calculated relative free energy is 1.7 kcal/mol higher than that of 33ts. When alkyl cuprous 27 is formed, the Cu–C bond can be protonated by the amine to form 28. The intermediate 28 can isomerize to cuprous vinylidene imine 30 via four-membered ring transition state 29ts, and then intermediate 30 is isomerized to amino cuprous 31. Intermediate 31 can also be protonated by the amine via four-membered ring transition state 32ts with an energy barrier of 1.8 kcal/mol to give the hydroamination product and regenerate amino cuprous active species 4. In the whole reaction, an alcohol or amine can be deprotonated by the Brønsted base (i.e. the HDMS− ligand) to afford an anionic species, which can be further stabilized by the Lewis acid catalyst (i.e. the Cu(I)/dppe compound) through the formation of the Cu–O or Cu–N bond. The competition between hydroxylation and hydroamination is clearly shown in Fig. 3 . In the presence of the Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst, each of the alcohol and amine reactants can be deprotonated by the Brønsted base. The generated anionic species can be further stabilized by the Lewis acid. Although the neutral alcohol is a relative weak nucleophile, its acidity is significantly higher than that of the amine. The nucleophilicity and acidity informations can be obtained from the nucleophilic Parr functions (Pk −) and NPA charge data (Table S1 of SI). Therefore, deprotonation of the alcohol to afford alkylate cuprous intermediate 8 is exergonic. By contrast, the corresponding deprotonation of benzyl amine is endergonic by 7.0 kcal/mol. Therefore, generation of the corresponding amino cuprous intermediate 24 is unfavorable. Although the nucleophilicity of the amino group is higher than that of the alkylate, the overall activation free energy for nucleophilic attack to alkene by using the alkylate is 5.7 kcal/mol lower than that using the amino group. Conclusions In summary, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism and chemoselectivity of cuprous/aminolithium catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of acrylonitrile. In the presence of a Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst, an alcohol shows higher reactivity than the corresponding amine, which is contrary to the uncatalyzed case (Figure S1 of the SI). The DFT calculations showed that when an amino cuprous species is considered to be the active species, deprotonation of an alcohol or an amine would result in a cuprous alkoxide or amino intermediate. Acrylonitrile can then insert into the corresponding Cu–O or Cu–N bond to afford an alkyl cuprous species, which can be protonated by bis(trimethylsilyl)amine to give the hydrofunctionalized product and regenerate the amino cuprous active species. We found that the acidity of the alcohol is significantly higher than that of the amine, so it is easily deprotonated. The generated alkylate species is more stable than the corresponding amino species. Therefore, the alcohol shows higher reactivity than the corresponding amine in the presence of a Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst. A weaker nucleophile is a stronger Brønsted acid. Therefore, it can be deprotonated by the Brønsted base to afford an anionic species stabilized by a Lewis acid catalyst, which shows higher reactivity. This provides a powerful way to regulate the reactivity of nucleophiles.

As a weaker nucleophile is also a stronger Brønsted acid, it can be selectively deprotonated by a Brønsted base to give an anionic species that shows higher reactivity. Following this idea, the reactivity of nucleophiles can be controlled by using an appropriate Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst. Cuprous/aminolithium catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of acrylonitrile with an alcohol and an amine were chosen as model reactions. As the acidity of the alcohol is significantly higher than that of amine, the former is more easily deprotonated. Therefore, an alcohol shows higher reactivity than an amine in the presence of a Lewis acid/Brønsted base pair catalyst, reversing the selectivity trend.",
