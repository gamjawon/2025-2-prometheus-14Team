D. AGARWAL School of Studies in Chemistry, Jiwaji University, Gwalior (M.P.) (India) Summary Cis-dioxomolybdenum complexes, having tetradentate and tridentate ligands, as catalyst with t-butylhydroperoxide gave epoxides from olefins in good yield. The catalysts, except Mo02(apac), have been found to withstand the oxidative conditions. The steric environment due to the ligand around the metal center plays a significant role in the epoxidation of substi- tuted olefins, viz., isoprene and l,2-dimethyl-l,4-cyclohexadiene and cis- and trans-2-hexene. The steric effect due to nonporphyrin ligands is much less than that observed with catalysts having porphyrin ligands. Introduction The development of new pathways for the selective oxidation of hydro- carbons continues to be an important goal for the research chemist [1]. The wide range of oxidative transformations, viz. epoxidation, oxidation, hydro- xylation, oxidative demethylation, etc. catalysed by monooxygenase cytochrome P-450 through the activation of molecular oxygen has focussed attention on synthetic metalloporphyrins and related complexes as potential oxidation catalysts [2-8]. The metalloporphyrins of Fe(III) and Mn(III) have been screened widely for their ability to catalytically oxidise organic substrates. Molybdenum complexes have been much less studied. Sheldon [9] has reported that during the epoxidation of cyclohexene using dioxo- molybdenum(VI) phthalocyanine, demetallation occurred after induction period. Various other workers [10, 11] have shown that the ligand effect is observable only in the initial stages of the reaction because of the rapid destruction of the original complex under oxidising conditions. Recently Ledon et at. [12] have reported the 0=Mo(TPP)OMe-catalysed epoxidation of olefins. It was suggested by Ledon et al. that the epoxidation takes place with high selectivity without demetallation. They also observed that the steric environment of the porphyrin ligand gave interesting results with isoprene. In the present report, we describe the epoxidation of various olefins using nonporphyrin tridentate and tetradentate ligands. The stability of Mo02(L) complexes have been studied. The effect of the steric envi- ronment due to various ligands has been evaluated. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 66 Experimental All starting alkenes were verified by gas chromatography to ensure that no oxidation products were present before reaction. Isoprene was distilled before use. Analytical gas chromatography was done on a Perkin-Elmer model 3920 equipped with flame ionisation detector, with OV-17 as the chromatographic column. The gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction products was carried out at 80 C, except in the case of isoprene where 35 C was used. ^ NMR spectra at 90 MHz were measured with a Perkin Elmer R-32 spectrophotometer. t-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was taken in benzene and estimated by the known procedure [13]. l,2-Dimethyl-l,4- cyclohexadiene was synthesized by the reported procedure [14]. Synthesis of the catalysts The ligands salicylaldehyde ethylenediamine (salen), acetylacetone ethylenediamine (acen), o-aminophenolacetylacetone (apac), anthranilic acid acetylacetone (anac), salicylaldehyde o-aminophenol (sap) were synthesized by condensation. The 4-(2-hydroxyphenyl) hydrazonopentane-2,4-dione (hydrazone) was synthesized by diazotising o-aminophenol and then coupling with acetylacetone. The cis-dioxomolybdenum complexes were synthesized by refluxing the appropriate ligand with MoO^acac); in ethanol. The complexes were recrystallized using dimethyl sulphoxide and character- ised using various spectral and analytical techniques. Procedure for the epoxidation of olefins Olefin (0.02 mol), t-butylhydroperoxide (0.002 mol), catalyst (MoG^L) (0.0002 mol) and benzene (20 ml as solvent) were placed in a three-necked round-bottom flask. Dodecane was used as an internal standard. The contents were heated to 70 C while using a magnetic stirrer. The temper- ature for isoprene epoxidation was kept at 40 C. The contents were heated for 5 h, then cooled and catalyst removed by filtration. The t- butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) was decomposed using aqueous sodium sulphite solution. The contents were extracted with ether, and the samples so obtained were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The product was analysed using gas chromatography. The competitive epoxidation of cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cyclo- heptene, cyclooctene and norbornene was carried out using MoO^salen) as a representative catalyst in a three-necked flask at 80 C by taking cyclohexene and another olefin. The relative rate was determined considering the rate of cyclohexene as 1. For product analysis in the epoxidation of stilbenes, the catalyst was removed and NMR spectral analyses of the samples were made. The NMR analysis showed ci's-stilbene oxide (singlet 4.25) and trans-stilbene oxide (singlet 3.85,15.1) respectively. 67 Results and discussion Epoxidation of cyclohexene with all the catalysts gave cyclohexene oxide in very good yield. The gas chromatographic analysis shows that the epoxide was the sole product and neither cyclohexanone nor cyclohexanol was obtained. The two latter products are usually obtained as a result of a free radical pathway [15]. The epoxidation of cyclohexene was followed using gas chromatography (Fig. 1). The catalysts after the reaction were separated by filtration, washed, dried and subjected to melting point and IR studies. The m.p. (Table 1) and IR studies suggest that, except Mo02(apac) catalyst, all other catalysts, viz. MoOztsalen), Mo02(acen), MoO^aps), MoOz (anac) and MoO^hydrazone) withstand the oxidative conditions, and the epoxidation follows a heterolytic pathway. In the case of MoOztapac), deme- tallation of the catalyst takes place resulting in the recovery of the decomposed complex. Sheldon [15] has reported that a ligand effect may be observable only during the initial steps of the reaction due to ligand TABLE 1 Melting point of the Cts-dioxomolybdenum complexes before and after reaction No. Complex M.P. before epoxidation( C) M.P. after epoxidation( C) 1. 2. 3.4. 5. 6.

In the present studies, all the catalysts except MoO^apac) are stable in the reaction conditions and ligand effects can be observed with these catalysts. Epoxidation of cycloolefins, viz. cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cyclo- heptene, cyclooctene and norbomene, using MoO^salen) and t- butylhydroperoxide was studied. The results (Table 2) show that the relative rates of reactivity follow the order cyclooctene > norbomene > cyclopentene > cycloheptene > cyclohexene. Comparison of these data with that obtained with peracetic acid [16] (Table 2) shows that the relative reactivities of cycloheptene, cyclohexene and cyclopentene follow the same order. Higher rates of epoxidation observed with norbomene, cyclooctene and cycloheptene compared to cyclohexene show that the steric effect of the ligand (salen) does not play a significant role and also suggest that olefin is not coordinated to a metal center during the epoxidation. Had olefin been coordinated to a metal center, then the rate for olefins having carbon atom numbers higher than cyclohexene would have been lower, contrary to what was observed with Mo02(salen) catalyst. Hydrogenation of olefins using RhCl(PPh3)3 shows that the rate of hydrogenation decreases with increasing olefin ring size, i.e. Cs> C6>C-,> Cs>C<), as coordination of the olefin to the metal center takes place in the transition state [17]. A similar relative epoxidation rate with different cyclic olefins using 0=Mo(TPP)OMe/cumene hydroperoxide system has been observed [18]. The cyclic olefin rate sequence, cyclopentene > cycloheptene > cyclohexene, was predicted by Garbish et al. [19] and Rickbom and Cham [20] in diimide reduction. They suggested that the dominant enthalpy feature in establishing this order appears to be relief of torsional strain, with diminished bond angle strain also playing an important role in cyclopentene. In view of the similarities in proposed transition states for epoxidation and diimide reduction, the same sequence might be observed for these reactions. The observed results with Mo02(salen)/t-butyl hydroperoxide system shows that torsional strain and bond angle strain play important roles in anticipat- ing the relative reactivity of cyclic olefins. The higher rates of cyclopentene epoxidation compared to that of cyclohexene and cycloheptene is explained TABLE 2 Relative rate of epoxidation of cyclic olefins Olefin MoOiCsalen) complex 0=Mo(TPP)OMe Peracetic acid cyclopentene cyclohexene cycloheptene cyclooctene norbomene 1.40 1.00 1.24 2.00 1.62 1.35 1.00 1.26 2.90 2.20 1.51 1.00 1.36 69 by the fact that bond angle strain plays a much more important role in cyclopentene than in cyclohexene or cycloheptene. Epoxidation stereochemistry As observed with peracids, using the MoC>2(salen)/TBHP system aliphatic olefins were stereospecifically epoxidized: cis-2-hexene gave cis- epoxide and trans-2-hexene gave only trans-epoxide (Kc^/K^ns =2.8). This value of 2.8 is larger than that obtained with per acids (Kcfs/K^ns = 1-2 - 2.2). The epoxidation ratio value for Mo(CO)<;/t-butyl hydroperoxide system is K^IK^ = 2.0 [21], with Mo02(acen) K^/K^n, = 2.75, with MoO; (hydrazone) Kcis/Kfrans was 2.4, while MoOzCapac), which undergoes deme- tallation, gave a value equal to that observed with Mo(CO)e, suggesting that a similar catalytic species is involved in both cases. These values observed for cis-2-hexene and frans-2-hexene are larger than those obtained with peracids, but much lower than those observed with the systems Fe(TPP)Cl/PhIO (Kcisl Kfran. = 5.8) [22], Mn'\"(TPP)OAC/NaOCl (K^/K^, = 5.0) [23], Mn'\"- (TPP)Cl-02-sodium ascorbate (K,JK^. = 4.7) [24], 0=Mo(TPP)OMe/ TBHP (Kcis/Kfrans =s 3-5) [21]. These observations suggest that the cis-isomer was epoxidized at a faster rate, and the various KcislK-trans values suggest that a steric effect due to the ligands is present but its value is less than that observed with porphyrin ligand. The retention of configuration favours the addition of an electrophilic oxygen atom in these catalysed epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of aromatic alkenes, i.e. cis- and frans-stilbene, was found to give good yields of stilbene oxide. The relative reactivity between cis- and frans-stilbene was found to fall in the range Kc,,/K(n,ns = 1-1 -1-2. Epoxi- dation using m-chloroperbenzoic acid in methylene chloride at room temper- ature was found to give equal rates for cis- and frans-stilbene. This observation with various Mo02(L) complexes/t-butyl hydroperoxide system is in contrast to that of Fe'\"(TPP)Cl/PhIO [25], where cis-epoxide was formed 15 times faster (KcislK^ns = 15) than frans-epoxide. This selec- tivity was inferred to result from non-bonded interactions between the phenyl group of the frans-stilbene and the pendant phenyl group of the Fe'\"(TPP)Cl catalyst. But studies with FePPIX-DME (ferriprotoporphyrin dimethyl ester)/Ph!0 system [25] show that a mixture of cis- and trans- stilbene gave low but equal yields of the two epoxides. Here the substituent methyl and vinyl groups of FePPIX-DME make this porphyrin relatively flat, whereas phenyl groups of the Fe'\"(TPP)Cl are constrained to be nearly perpendicular to the porphyrin plane. The results with 0=Mo(TPP)OMe/ TBHP system (KcisfK^ns = 1-1) show that in this case no non-bonded inter- action between the phenyl group of the stilbene and the phenyl group of the porphyrin ligand takes place [18]. The observation that Kcis/K^ans = 1.1 - 1.2 with MoC>2(L) catalysts also suggests that a steric effect due to the ligands is not involved in the transition state or rate-determining step, hence the observed values are close to those observed with the peracid system. 70 Also the values very similar to O^Mo^PP^Me suggest that a similar transition state is involved in both cases. Steric and electronic effects The epoxidation of isoprene provides an opportunity to compare steric and electronic effects for this epoxidation reaction. Table 3 shows the varia- tion in the ratios of epoxides obtained with substituted and unsubstituted double bonds. Epoxidations with peracid [26-28] are known to favour the substituted double bond; indeed this has been used as one of the criteria to establish the concerted three-centered transition state generally accepted for this oxidation. The Mo02(L)/TBHP system has an even greater preference for the substituted double bond, suggesting that the Mo02(L)-catalysed epo- xidation is more electrophilic in nature than are the peracid reactions. The effect of non-bonded interactions is apparent with Mo0^(ana.c) (Table 3), since the preference for the substituted double bond has decreased to a 2.4:1 ratio relative to the unsubstituted double bond. The ratio with Mo(CO)e)/ TBHP system is 4:1 and the values with 0=Mo(TPP)OMe/TBHP system is 0.7:1 [21]. These observations suggest that the steric factor of the ligands under investigation is responsible for the observed change in selectivity, but the steric effect due to these ligands is much less than that observed with porphyrin ligand, where the steric factor outweighs the electronic factor. Another interesting example of steric and electronic effects was studied using the epoxidation of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexadiene, when a competitive epoxidation of it and cyclohexene was studied using the MoO;- (anac)/TBHP system. The rate of epoxidation was found to be 3.25:1. This ratio with the MO(CO)(,/TBHP and 0=Mo(TPP)OMe/TBHP system was 5:1 and 1.5:1 respectively [18]. Here the two methyl groups increase the electron density at the disubstituted d.ouble bond, making it a preferable site for epoxidation although the anac ligand exhibited some steric effect, decreasing the rate from 5 to 3.25, even though the electronic factor is very strong. The porphyrin ligand of 0=Mo(TPP)OMe catalyst showed greater steric influence than the anac ligand. All the aforesaid experiments show that the ligand retains its effect, and hence suggest that the catalyst is not destroyed during the oxidative conditions.

It was observed that the reaction was very slow and selectivity was poor when Na2HP04 and NaHCOa were used. The reaction was considerably faster compared to basic medium when sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer was used. This can be explained as follows: Basic pH: 0 00 || \\ || Q~ \\ || ,Q -M-O+ROa\" > M^ /OR \" M<.\\ (a) /i\\ -7 ^o^ ^/^6 Acidic pH: 0 0 \\\\\\^0 ^ || /OH M\" +R02H >-lYk /OR ^ | \\ -7 ^0^ (b) These reactions show that the basic pH of the reaction medium leads to the formation of a complex which has weaker catalytic activity than the cis- dioxomolybdenum catalyst. A mechanism similar to that proposed by Sharpless et al. [15] can be proposed for the cis-dioxomolybdenum complexes, where first the hydro- peroxide coordinates to the metal center and then oxygen atom transfer to the olefin takes place.

SHUKLA Discipline of Coordination Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar 364002 (India) Summary A ruthenium(III) analogue of the model peroxidase system Ru(III)- EDTA-ascorbic acid-HzO; is an efficient catalyst for the oxidation of cyclo- hexane. The kinetics of the oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol by hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the Ru(III)-EDTA-ascorbate system was investigated by spectrophotometric techniques in the pH range 1.50 to 2.50 at 30 C, p. = 0.1 M KNOs in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 1,4-dioxane and water. The rate of oxidation of cyclohexane is first order with respect to the con- centrations of ascorbate, Ru(III)-EDTA and fl-^O^, inverse first order with respect to hydrogen ion concentration, and fractional order with respect to cyclohexane. The kinetic parameters of the oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol were determined by potentiometric, spectrophotometric and gas chroma- tographic methods. On the basis of the kinetic and experimental results, a rate law for the reaction was derived and the mechanism discussed. In the proposed mechanism, the function of the two-electron donor, ascorbic acid, is to reduce the metal chelate Ru(III)-EDTA to Ru(II)-EDTA. The reduced metal chelate Ru(II)-EDTA catalyzes the oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol. Introduction The model peroxidase system [1] which employs iron salts, ascorbic acid and molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is one of the efficient methods for oxygen atom insertion in organic substrates. Udenfriend et al. reported that a system consisting iron salts, ascorbic acid and molecular oxygen can hydroxylate various organic substrates [2 - 4]. In the presence of a reducing agent such as ascorbic acid, isoascorbic acid, catechol, dihydroxy- fumaric acid, ninhydrin or alloxan, hydrogen peroxide hydroxylates *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 74 aromatic compounds at specific sites on the aromatic ring system [5 - 7]. Although a variety of organic compounds [1] were oxidized by the model peroxidase system using Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, the reaction however remained of academic interest because of low yields of the products formed and the non-specificity of the reaction. During the last several years, the selective oxidation of various organic compounds by molecular oxygen catalyzed by Ru(III)-EDTA was reported [8 - 15]. In all these reactions Ru(III)-EDTA was found to be an efficient catalyst for the oxidation of a variety of organic substrates such as ascorbic acid [8 - 10], cyclohexanol [II], allyl alcohol [12], triphenyl phosphine [13] and aliphatic amines [14, 15]. Since Ru(III)-EDTA has shown good reactivity as an oxidation and oxygenation catalyst in a number of systems, we thought that a Ru(III) analogue of the model peroxidase system, i.e. Ru(III)-EDTA-ascorbate-H202 would serve as a catalyst in oxidation reac- tions. In the present paper we report the kinetics and mechanism of the liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexane by the Ru(III) analogue of the model peroxidase system. Experimental Materials A fresh solution of A.R. grade L-ascorbic acid used in the present investigation was prepared with deaerated double-distilled water for each experiment. Ruthenium trichloride trihydrate (Johnson, Matthey Inc.) was dissolved in 1 M hydrochloric acid and Ru(III) was estimated spectrophoto- metrically [16, 17]. An A.R. grade sample of the disodium salt of ethylene- diaminetetraacetic acid obtained from Merck was used in the investigation. The Ru(III)-EDTA complex was prepared in situ in the reaction mixture by adding the solution of ruthenium trichloride trihydrate and ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio. The concentration of free metal ion was calculated from the reported stability data [18]. Potassium nitrate (A.R. grade) was used as a supporting electrolyte to maintain the ionic strength (0.1 M) of the reaction mixture. The substrate cyclohexane and the cosolvent 1,4-dioxane were of A.R. grade reagents. A fresh solution of hydrogen per- oxide was prepared for each experiment and standardized against potassium permanganate. Analytical The purity of the solvent 1,4-dioxane and cyclohexane was verified with a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-9A assembled with programmed and computerized Chromatopac CR-3A using a stainless steel column, 3 mm i.d X 4 mm o.d. X 2.00 m, containing 10% Carbowax 20M on 90-100 mesh Anakron on T.C.D. A synthetic standard of the product cyclohexanol was used to determine the yields by a comparison of peak areas and corresponding 75 retention time with a column temperature of 120 - 200 C. A thermal con- ductivity detector at 200 C, using molecular hydrogen as a carrier gas, was used for product analysis. Kinetic measurement The kinetics of the oxidation of cyclohexane was followed by spectro- photometric techniques as reported earlier [10]. The kinetic data for the oxidation of the reaction were obtained with a DU-7 high speed UV-Visible spectrophotometer by monitoring the peak at 510 nm for the disappearance of ascorbic acid. First-order kinetic data in terms of the concentration of ascorbic acid were computed from slopes of the plot of log AA versus time (multiplied by 2.303) (Fig. 1) where AA is the difference in absorbance at zero and experimental time. The value of the absorbance at zero time was selected after examining the absorbance versus time plot for each set of runs. During the reaction, the mixture in the cell was continuously stirred by a mag- netic stirrer. The temperature of the reaction was maintained constant by circulating water through a jacketted glass cell. A Digisun Model DI-707 pH meter correct to 0.01 pH fitted with a combination glass electrode was used to measure log[H\"1']. The electrode system was calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentration at the constant ionic strength of 0.1 M KN03 by direct titration of HC1 and carbonate-free sodium hydroxide in the acidic and alkaline ranges, respectively. The substrate cyclohexane was dissolved in sufficient quantity of 1,4-dioxane to maintain a 1:1 water:dioxane ratio in the reaction mixture. Equilibrium measurement The dissociation constants of L-ascorbic acid were determined by poten- tiometric titrations, maintaining the ionic strength /x at 0.1 M KNOa with a digital pH meter. The stability constant of Ru(III)-EDTA-ascorbate (1:1:1) complex was calculated spectrophotometrically at p. = 0.1 M KNC>3 by observing the optical densities on variation of the concentrations of ascorbic acid by the reported method [8-10]. Results Equilibrium studies The first and second dissociation constants of L-ascorbic acid deter- mined potentiometrically, and the stability constant of Ru(III)-EDTA- ascorbate (1:1:1) complex determined spectrophotometrically, are listed in Table 1. The various equilibrium constants are presented by eqns. 1-3.

Kinetic studies Dependence of the rate of oxidation of cyclohexane on catalyst concentration The effect of the change of the concentration of the catalyst, Ru(III)- EDTA complex, for the oxidation of cyclohexane in the model peroxidase system was observed by conducting the experiments at five different concen- trations of Ru(III)-EDTA, ranging from 1 X 10-4 M to 5 X 10-4 M at pH = 2.50, JU = 0.1 M KNC>3 at 30 C, keeping the concentration of other reactants constant. The rate of the reaction was found to be first order with respect to [Ru-EDTA], A plot of the first-order rate constant feobs versus Ru(III)- EDTA concentration (d log fcobs/d log[Ru(III)-EDTA] = 1) gives a straight line passing through the origin (Fig. 1). Dependence of the rate on the ascorbic acid concentration The rate of oxidation of cyclohexane increases with an increase in the concentration of ascorbic acid. First-order kinetic plots (Fig. 2) of log AA us. time were linear, which indicates that the reaction is, in fact, first order with respect to ascorbic acid concentration. 77 2.0 3-0 t0 6-0 [Ru(i\")-EDTA3x1(/M Fig. 1.

Dependence of the rate on the cyclohexane concentration The experimental results of the dependence on cyclohexane concentra- tion are given in Table 2.

Dependence of the rate on the hydrogen peroxide concentration In order to observe the dependence of hydrogen peroxide on the rate of oxidation of cyclohexane, experiments were carried out at different molar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, keeping the concentration of other 78 TABLE 2 Observed first-order rate constants (feobs) ^OT the oxidation of cyclohexane at various con- centrations of cyclohexane [cyclohexane] X 103 M 1.00 2.50 6.00 10.00 20.00 feobs X 104, s-1 3.47 4.22 5.21 6.98 7.68 Conditions: temp. 30 C, p. = 0.1 M KNOa, pH = 2.50, [Ru(III)-EDTA] = 5 X 10-4 M, [ascorbic acid] s 5 X 10-3 M, [H^Oi] = 11.10 X 10-4 M. i 6 e 10 12 [H2023 10*M.

In the concentration range 2.5 X 10-4 M to 11.1 X 10~4 M of hydrogen peroxide, the rate of oxidation of cyclohexane increases with increasing concentration of hydrogen peroxide. A plot of first-order rate constant feobs versus the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (d log feobs/ d loglHaO;] =1) shows first-order dependence of the reaction on hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 3). Dependence of the rate on the hydrogen ion concentration A rapid increase in the rate of oxidation was observed with a decrease in the hydrogen ion concentration. Over the pH range 1.50 - 2.50, the observed first-order rate constants feobs were found to increase directly with increasing pH. A marked increase in the rate of oxidation with increasing pH may be associated with the dissociation of ascorbic acid to the mono- ascorbate anion. A plot of feobs versus the inverse of hydrogen ion concen- tration (d log feobsM pH = 1) passes through the origin, indicating an inverse first-order dependence of the reaction in hydrogen ion concentration. The experimental data showing the first-order rate dependence on hydrogen ion concentration are given in Table 3.

Agarwal School of Studies in Chemistry, Jiwaji University, Gwalior (M.P.India Cis-dioxomolybdenum complexes, having tetradentate and tridentate ligands, as catalyst with t-butylhydroperoxide gave epoxides from olefins in good yield. The catalysts, except MoO2(apac), have been found to withstand the oxidative conditions. The steric environment due to the ligand around the metal center plays a significant role in the epoxidation of substituted olefins, viz., isoprene and 1,2-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene and cis-and trans-2-hexene. The steric effect due to nonporphyrin ligands is much less than that observed with catalysts having porphyrin ligands.
