Kirillov Managing Guest Editor CQE, IST, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal CQE, IST, Universidade de Lisboa Portugal The design of novel protocols for an efficient and selective functionalization of C–H bonds in various organic substrates to form C–C, C–O, C–N, and other types of bonds continues to be a challenging research direction in the fields of catalysis, organic synthesis, coordination and materials chemistry. Since most of the C–H bond activation and functionalization reactions require the use of a metal containing catalyst, the development of new and improved catalytic systems as well as the understanding of their kinetic and mechanistic features are of special importance to Molecular Catalysis. It is thus expected that the implementation of improved catalytic systems will not only lead to the generation of different value added products via C–H functionalization, but can also have an economic and environmental impact, namely by applying milder reaction conditions and achieving improved product selectivity and atom efficiency. The present Special Issue of the Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical contains a collection of 5 reviews and 33 research articles covering diverse aspects of the catalytic C–H functionalization. The Special Issue has been organized to honor Prof. Georgiy B. Shul’pin on the occasion of his 70th birthday, and also in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the field of C–H bond activation and functionalization (for further details, see his Biosketch). Many leading authors in the field of the catalytic C–H functionalization and colleagues of Prof. Shul’pin have contributed to this Special Issue. In fact, it represents a good level of internationalization, including authors from 22 countries. The Special Issue covers molecular aspects of the catalytic C–H functionalization and encompasses distinct and modern examples of homogeneous catalytic systems (major part of articles) with a considerable focus on the design of new metal-complex catalytic systems (based on Cu, Fe, Mn, Rh, Ir, Ru, Pd, Pt, and other metals), a few examples of heterogeneous or supported catalysts, an article on organocatalysis, and several papers with a strong computational contribution. Distinct classes of substrates that contain various types of C–H bonds have been investigated, along with reaction mechanisms and kinetic features in many cases. In particular, a good number of articles in the Special Issue focus on the functionalization of Csp3–H bonds in alkanes, which is a rather difficult task due to a high inertness of these hydrocarbons. In fact, the selective functionalization of alkanes (main components of natural gas and oil) has been of significant importance, both from academic or industrial viewpoints. It has also constituted a main topic of the Prof. Shul’pin's research. Even the industrial processes for the oxidative functionalization of alkanes are typically conducted at very low conversions to maintain an acceptable selectivity and minimize an overoxidation of products. The newly developed technologies to explore a previously not accessible oil (for example, Shale oil in USA and pre-salt in Brazil) show that the hydrocarbon reserves will be kept for much longer time than previously predicted. Thus, the research on the C–H activation and functionalization of alkanes would continue to be a very prospective topic and new highly efficient catalysts and selective processes are expected to emerge in future. We hope that this Special Issue will become a valuable collection of reviews and articles, and will be of considerable interest to researchers working in the area of modern catalytic C–H functionalization and related topics. Besides, a broad interest and importance of this research area can also be shown by a recently started European COST action CA15106 entitled “C–H Activation in Organic Synthesis (CHAOS)” [cost-chaos.org]. This COST action aims to promote trans-national cooperation across the Europe in the area of C–H activation, making it a versatile and general tool for various organic transformations, which very often rely on the use of tailored metal containing catalysts. Several members of this COST action have contributed with their recent research to this Special Issue.
