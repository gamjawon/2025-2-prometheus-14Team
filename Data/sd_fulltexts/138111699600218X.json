Introduction CO hydrogenation over oxide catalysts selectively forms branched-chain compounds such as isobutane [1], isobutene [2], isoprene [3], 2methylpropanal [1,4], and isobutanol [4]. Zr02 catalyst is especially selective for isobutene formation [2]. The in situ IR measurements of Zr02 at 523 and 673 K showed the presence of only methoxide and formate species on the surface [5]. 13C CP MAS NMR measurements of Zr02 treated with a mixture of CO and HZ at 523 and 653 K, rapidly cooled by liquid nitrogen, and then slowly warmed under vacuum Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11 S1381-1169(96)00218-X confirmed the surface species [6]. The chemical trapping of the surface species on the same Zr02 with a vapor of diluted aqueous HCl solution at room temperature and of dimethyl sulfate at 553 K formed only methanol and methyl formate, respectively [6]. The addition of dimethyl ether to a mixture of CO and H 2 enhanced the formation of hydrocarbons maintaining the high selectivity of isobutene [7]. These results indicate the participation of methoxide species in the formation of isobutene. Regarding the formation of isobutanol from CO and H 2 over oxide catalyst, Mazanec proposed the mechanism of CO insertion into the M-C bond of a surface-bound aldehyde [8]. Chain-branching mechanism on isobutene formation over Zr02 proposed by Ekerdt and l K.-i. Maruya et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 143-51 coworkers consisted of two paths (i) CO insertion into the zirconium-carbon bond of adsorbed aldehydic intermediate and (ii) condensation between ri-enolate and methoxide species [9]. On the other hand, it is well known that methanol synthesis catalysts can produce isobutanol from CO and H2, which has the same carbon framework with isobutene. Nunan and coworkers have studied in detail the formation mechanism of higher alcohols from CO and H 2 over methanol synthesis catalysts, where the CO hydrogenation was carried out in the coexistence of 13C-labeled oxygenates such as 13CH30H, 12CH313CH20H, and 13CH30H12CH312CH20H. The conclusions were as follows: (i) dominant source of both carbons of ethanol was methanol [ 10], (ii) branched primary alcohols were formed through addition of C 1 species to position of C,, surface species [11], and (iii) linear primary alcohols were given through C 1 addition steps at the alcohol end of the growing chain [11]. Ueda and coworkers showed that the reaction of ethanol or propanol with methanol over modified MgO catalysts formed propanol and isobutanol, respectively, although the reaction of methanol alone over the same catalyst gave no higher alcohols [12]. In our previous papers, it was shown that Ce02 forms 2-methylpropanal at 523 K as the second main product, while the addition of In203 to Ce02 lead to the hydrogenation product of isobutanol from 2-methylpropanal as a main product at the same temperature [4]. Since Ce02 gives isobutene at 673 K as a main product, the branched C4 oxygenates at the lower temperatures are likely to be precursors of isobutene. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate the role of methoxide species for the formation of isobutene by means of 13C tracer method. 2. Experimental Zirconium was prepared according to the previous papers [2,7]. CO hydrogenation with 13C tracer was carried out in a glass vacuum system equipped with a gas circulation pump. Total volume of the circulation system was 470 ml, in which volume of the reactor was 55 ml. The reactor was able to be isolated from the gas circulation line for changing the reaction gas. 12 CO hydrogenation on Zr02 catalyst pretreated with a mixture of 13 CO and H2 (1/3) was carried out as follows. Zr02 (4.0 g) was evacuated at 973 K for 3 h. After the reaction of 13 CO and HZ at 643 K and 67 kPa for 3 h, the gas in the circulation line except a small volume of reactor was changed to 12 CO and HZ while keeping the temperature of the reactor, and then 12 CO hydrogenation at the same temperature and pressure started. The products were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature. After the 12 CO hydrogenation in a given time, the catalyst was heated at 773 K for 1 h in air and evacuated at 973 K for 30 min. The treatment with 13 CO and H2 followed by the reaction with 12 CO and H2 restarted. This reaction cycle was repeated 8 times for the collection of products enough to obtain clear 13C NMR spectra. 13 CO hydrogenation on dimethyl ether (180 Torr)-adsorbed Zr02 (4.0 g) was carried out at 643 K for 20 min. The products were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature. 1300 with 99.3o purity was obtained from MSD isotopes. 12C0 was purified by a trap at liquid nitrogen temperature. H 2 was purified by a deoxo and a liquid nitrogen temperature. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a JEOL-GX-500 as a CDC13 solution using TMS as an internal standard. The assignment of carbons of isobutene was carried out using the products from the reaction of 1300 and H2 over Zr02. The assignments of carbons of ethylene and propylene were carried out using unenriched ethylene and propylene. 3. Results 3.1. Estimation of 13C concentration The concentration of 13C tracer in three kinds of carbons of isobutene was estimated as an K-i.

Methylene, central, and methyl carbons in isobutene are denoted as C(a), C(b), and C(c), respectively. Fig. 1 shows the '3C NMR spectrum of products in 'ZCO hydrogenation at 643 K for initial 20 min over Zr02 pretreated with '3C0 and Hz at the same temperature for 3 h. The '3C NMR spectrum of isobutene formed in '3C0 hydrogenation over a fresh Zr02 indicated that the peaks of 142.40, 110.45, and 24.10 ppm were due to C(b), C(a), and C(c), respectively, and the coupling constants of 'J(C(a)-C(b)), 'J(C(c)-C(b)), and 1J(C(a)-00) were 71.72, 41.20, and 3.05 Hz, respectively. A singlet at 124.85 and a triplet at 77.21 ppm in Fig. 2 correspond to COZ and CHCl3, respectively. Therefore, Fig. 1 shows that the products consist mainly of isobutene. Fig. 2 shows that the singlet of C(a) is smaller than the doublet due to the coupling with '3C(b). The ratio of peak area of the doublet to the singlet would give ratio of the concentration of 13C to tZC in C(b). The same ratio could be estimated also from the peaks of C(c). The calculation of 13C concentration in C(a) and C(c) was more complexed because of the coupling of '3C(b) with one '3C(a) and two '3C(c)s. When all combinations of the couplings are perfectly separated, there should be 15 peaks. j PPM 110.5 11 .0 Fig. 2. Enlarged '3C NMR spectrum of the C(a) region of Fig. 1. 146 K A.

Thus, the concentrations of ~3C in C(a) and C(c) could be estimated. 3.2. 12C0 hydrogenation over 7'r02 treated with 12 CO hydrogenation over Zr02 pretreated with a mixture of 13 CO and H 2 was carried out using Zr02 of 4.0 g at 643 K, at which the selectivity and the yield of isobutene were higher than those at 673 K. Fig. 4 shows the time course of 13C concentrations in C(a), C(b), and C(C) carbons, which were obtained as described above. The data of the reaction time of 10 min were obtained from the products collected for the initial 20 min. Similarly, the reaction times of 30, 90, and 150 min refer to the product collection from 20 to 40, from 60 to 120, and from 120 to 180 min, respectively. C(b) was higher in 13C concentration than C(a) and C(c). 13C concentrations of C(a) and C(C) were almost the same, showing the fast isomerization of double bond. 13C concentration in K.-i.

Since the spectrum was measured under off-resonance condition, the coupling between H and 13C appeared clearly. Methyl of isobutene is quartet at 24.1 ppm due to coupling only with proton, and therefore, there was no coupling of methyl carbon with 13C(b) carbon. Similarly, methylene was a triplet at 110.45 ppm. No peak due to C(b) was observed around 142.4 ppm. A quartet at 18.7 ppm is due to a methyl group of propylene. Although methylene of propylene is observed as a triplet at 115.4 ppm, there is no doublet due to methine. A triplet due to methylene of ethylene was observed at 122.8 ppm. Although 13C-H couplings are observed, no 13C-13C coupling was detected. .. . . , _ ,ppm 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 Fig. 5. 13C NMR spectrum of the products formed from 13C0 and HZ at 643 K for 20 min over Zr02, which was treated with dimethyl ether at room temperature and 180 Torr. 148 4. Discussion 4.1. Chain branching mechanism Isobutene has been thought to be formed through dehydration of isobutanol, which is given by the hydrogenation of 2-methylpropanal [6-9]. Aldol-condensation-type reaction of propanal with C 1 oxygenate and carbonylation at carbon of carbonyl of 712-adsorbed acetone have been proposed for chain branching to form 2-methylpropanal. Mazanec proposed the mechanism as shown in Scheme 1, where chain branching occurs through CO insertion at carbon of 712-acetone.Nunan and coworkers have studied the formation mechanism of higher alcohols from CO and HZ over Cs-doped and undoped Cu/ZnO catalysts in detail [11]. The reaction of CO and H Z in the presence of 13C-labeled methanol or ethanol revealed that lower alcohols were incorporated into the synthesis to form higher alcohols and that carbon chain growth occurred in a step-wise manner dominated by the addition of oxygenated C 1 intermediates at the (3 carbons of the oxygenated C,, (n >_ 2) intermediates, although the formation mechanism of C 2 to C 3 alcohols depends on the presence and absence of Cs dopant. Thus, the chain branching and the chain growth are explained by the aldol-condensation type reaction. On the other hand, Ekerdt and coworkers proposed the mechanism for the formation of branched hydrocarbons over Zr02 catalyst, which consists of both the carbonylation similar to Scheme 1 and the aldol-con- CH3 H3 3 CH, CO ~C H3C- C_C C CH3 C` ,C=o a ~1'( O M il H cH H3 HC~CH O H H H3~CH-CH27 OH Scheme 1.

The mechanism of Cz oxygenate formation through two C, oxygenates reaction by Ref. [10]. densation of aldehyde with methoxide species [9]. We have proposed [6,13] the aldol-condensation type reaction for the chain branching over oxide catalysts based on that (i) addition of basic additives such as NaOH to Zr02 promoted the formation of isobutene [14] and (ii) cofeeding of acetaldehyde or acetaldehyde dimethylacetal to CO and H 2 remarkably enhanced the formation of isobutene [7]. The present low pressure conditions of less than 1 atm could prefer the aldol-condensation-type reaction to carbonylation at the carbon of carbonyl double bond. It is also known that Cp2Zr(r12-acetone) intermediate formed from Cp2Zr(CH3)Z and CO underwent carbonylation at the carbon atom of carbonyl group, while the reaction of the similar Zr complex with ketones or aldehydes under CO atmosphere gave only their enediolate-coordinated Zr complex but not the carbonylation product [15]. This may indicate the difficulty of carbonylation at the carbon atom of carbonyl double bond. 4.2. The role of methoxide species Nunan and coworkers reported the detailed investigation using 13C-enriched methanol and ethanol on the higher alcohol synthesis from syngas over modified methanol synthesis catalysts [10,11]. One of their conclusions is that ethanol is formed by coupling of oxygenated C 1 intermediates originating from methanol as in Scheme 2.The similar mechanism was first proposed by Fox and coworkers for the higher alcohol synthesis from methanol but not syngas [16] and was also presented by Foratti and coworkers [17]. This means that no carbons of higher alcohols are incorporated into the products without passing the path from CO to K-i. Maruya et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 143-51 methanol and that the mechanism is similar to higher alcohol synthesis from methanol and ethanol over Mg0-based catalysts [12]. On the other hand, the results of Figs. 4 and 5 show that isobutene from CO hydrogenation over Zr02 catalyst is composed of central carbon from surface methoxide species and methyl and methylene carbons from gaseous CO. The spectrum in Fig. 5 shows that there are no carboncarbons couplings between two carbons of ethylene and between central carbon and methyl and methylene carbons of propylene. Different from the reaction over methanol synthesis catalyst, the results in Figs. 4 and 5 mean that (i) one carbon of ethylene comes from methoxide species and the others from gas phase CO, (ii) the central carbon of propylene originates from methoxide species and methyl and methylene carbons from gaseous CO, and (iii) methyl and methylene carbons of isobutene come from gaseous CO and the central carbon from methoxide species. These seem to indicate that the CO-HZ reaction over oxide catalysts is different from that over methanol synthesis catalysts. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of C 2 species from CO and H2' One is CO insertion into ,u2-formaldehyde [8] and 112-formyl species [13] as in Scheme 3. CO insertion products in Scheme 3 undergo either (a) hydrogenation to afford acetaldehyde or (b) hydrogen shift by carbene-like character of carbonyl carbon to form enediolate dimer as in the reaction of Zr [18,19] and Th complex [20]. 0 M~- CH + MH10 M 0 /OCHZ ii CO /OCHZ-C, MM (a) CO insertion into p2-formyl species by Reference 13 CH., CO o=c\\ ~ j0 M M E (b) CO insertion into R2-formaldehyde species by Reference 8 Scheme 3. Mechanism of formation of CZ oxygenate through CO insertion. (a) CO insertion into lie-formyl species by Ref. [13]. (b) CO insertion into 11,2-formaldehyde species by Ref. [8]. 1C-CHz 0 M 149 The two carbons of enediolate dimer formed by the hydrogen shift can not be distinguished from each other. Therefore, the present result that each carbon of isobutene formed from CO and H 2 over Zr02 has the clear history as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 would eliminate this mechanism. The second path of acetaldehyde root (Scheme 3(a)) can not be denied by the present results if formyl comes from methoxide species. In this case the acetaldehyde formed is to consist of methyl given from formyl species and formyl from gaseous CO. In our previous paper, we reported that the reaction of CO and H Z over Zr02 forms paraformaldehyde type adsorbed species even at room temperature [21], while methoxide species slowly appears at 373 K [22]. Zr02 at 473 and 523 K began to form methanol after induction time of 20 and 3 h, respectively [7]. These results would indicate that formyl and formaldehyde are in equilibrium with gas phase CO and H2, while methoxide is not. Therefore, if n2-formaldehyde species in Scheme 3(a) is a precursor of the methyl group in acetaldehyde, the species must be given from methoxide but not directly from formaldehyde which is in equilibrium with the gas phase. On the other hand, it has been reported that zirconium-hydride complex undergoes carbonylation to yield n2-formaldehyde complex [18,19,23], which can be converted to methyl species by the reaction with zirconium-hydride complex [24], and thermolysis of the similar trimeric ( nz-formaldehyde)zirconocene complex at 473 K results in the cleavage of three CO-derived -CHZ- groups to form the `Cp2Zr oxide' trimer [23]. These suggest that r, 2 -formaldehyde species can be transformed to methyl or methylene species. The similar mechanism was also reported in the reaction of tantalum hydride complex with CO at low temperatures to form ,u-methylene complex [25]. If this kind of reaction should be possible on the Zr02 surface, the mechanism for the formation of r~2-formaldehyde intermediate could be proposed in Scheme 4. On the other hand, the direct cleavage of methyl-oxygen bond of alkoxide cluster 150 K-i.

Since Zr02 is one of the difficultto-reduce oxides [27] and even the Hz-treatment at 973 K showed no ESR signal due to Zr3+, it may be proposed that the formation of methyl and methylene species from n2 -formaldehyde species would be preferred to the direct formation of methyl species from methoxide species. Thus, methoxide species would be the direct precursor of 772-formaldehyde species, which is transformed to methyl or methylene-metal species of the precursor of C z oxygenates. 5. Conclusions 12 CO hydrogenation over Zr02 treated with a mixture of 13 CO and HZ and 13 CO hydrogenation over 12C-dimethyl ether-adsorbed Zr02 showed that central carbons of propylene and isobutene stemmed from methoxide species and the other carbons from gas phase CO produced 13 CH 2 -CH 2, 13 CH 2 =CH-13 CH 3, and 13CH2=C(13CH3)Z. From these results was proposed the reaction path which consists of the sequence of (i) conversion of methoxide species to nZ-formaldehyde species, (ii) formation of methyl or methylene species from the r12formaldehyde species by hydrogenation or thermolysis, (iii) carbonylation of the methyl or methylene species to form CZ oxygenate, (iv) aldol-condensation type reaction to form branched C4 oxygenates, and (v) formation of branched hydrocarbons from the hydrogenation followed by dehydration. It was proposed that the role of methoxide species was to form the formaldehyde species, which was not given directly from formaldehyde in equilibrium with gas phase CO and H 2. References [1] H.

The role of methoxide species in selective formation of isobutene from CO and H2 over ZrO2 was investigated by means of 13C tracer method. Analysis of 13C13C coupling in the formed isobutene showed that 12CO hydrogenation over ZrO2 pretreated with 13CO and H2 formed 12CH2 = 13C(12CH3)2, while 13CO hydrogenation over (12CH3)2O-adsorbed ZrO2 formed 13CH2 = 12C(13CH3)2. It was proposed from these results that methoxide species gave central carbon of isobutene, while the other carbons came from gas phase CO. A reaction path through methoxide species was proposed.
