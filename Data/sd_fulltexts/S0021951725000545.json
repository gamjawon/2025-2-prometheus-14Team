Graphical abstract Sunlight-driven overall water splitting (OWS) using particulate photocatalysts presents a promising strategy for a sustainable clean energy supply. Noble metals like platinum (Pt) are frequently employed as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) co-catalyst for photocatalytic OWS reaction. However, understandings on the dynamic evolution of co-catalysts during photocatalytic OWS remain poor and there lacks effective approaches to mediate this process as well as the metal-hydrogen interaction for efficient H2 evolution. In this work, using Pt/SrTiO3 photocatalyst as a model, we studied the change of Pt co-catalyst from PtOx to metallic Pt, and developed an amorphous FeOx modifier to promote this process by accelerating charge transfer to stabilize Pt in its metallic state, thereby thermodynamically facilitating HER by maintaining the Pt potential within a favorable range. Additionally, it weakens the Pt-H interaction, thereby promoting product release during photocatalytic OWS. This modification of amorphous FeOx exhibits universality on various noble metals co-catalysts such as Rh, Pd, Ru and Ni, paving the way for constructing efficient co-catalysts in photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry.

Notably, overall water splitting (OWS) using particulate photocatalysts has shown great potential in large-scale H2 production [3]. A high efficiency photocatalytic OWS system usually requires coupling a co-catalyst with a primary photocatalyst, not only to promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers but also to provide active sites for the surface redox reactions [4–7]. In this scenario, photogenerated electrons/holes are transferred to the co-catalysts, which inevitably undergo in-situ evolution in the presence of these highly energetic species. For instance, Ni, Rh, and Ir co-catalysts on various semiconductors have been reported to change their structures adaptively during photocatalytic OWS process [8–12]. Among diverse co-catalysts, platinum (Pt) has been widely adopted for photocatalytic OWS [13–15], where the chemical valence state of Pt co-catalyst plays crucial roles [16]. Metallic Pt is conducive to electrons extraction and HER kinetics, while oxidized Pt facilitates the suppression of reverse reactions [17]. Reducing the size of Pt co-catalysts from nanoparticles to clusters or even to single atoms enables the preservation of the oxidized state of Pt during the reaction, effectively avoiding undesired reverse reactions [18,19]. Yang et al. further observed reversible structural changes (Pt-O bond length and the coordination number) of PtOx co-catalyst on TiO2 during photocatalytic OWS by operando XAFS [20]. Albeit the dynamic evolution of co-catalysts during photocatalysis has been observed, the understanding of this phenomenon remains poor and there are currently no effective approaches to mediate this kind of in-situ process, which hinders the development of high-efficiency photocatalysts for OWS. Moreover, as an essential half reaction of OWS, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) proceeds with the same mechanism of electrocatalytic HER via Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel pathway, where the metal-hydrogen interaction (hydrogen adsorption free energy) plays a role in the overall reaction [21,22,4]. The desorption of hydrogen molecules from the photocatalyst surface is the final step of HER. Although conventional HER co-catalysts such as Pt exhibit excellent capacities for adsorbing and reducing protons to form atomic hydrogen and subsequently molecular hydrogen, weakening the interaction between the metal and hydrogen atom species likely plays a role in promoting the swift desorption of the produced gas during the HER process. Recently, it has been reported the adsorption strength of hydrogen atom on the single Pt atoms is weaker than that on Pt clusters or Pt nanoparticles (NPs), which optimizes the adsorption energy of H atom, effectively accelerating H2 release [23–25]. Encapsulating Ni or Co co-catalysts with graphitized carbon layer suppresses the formation of metal-H bonds on the surface of metal co-catalysts benefiting the desorption of H atom and subsequently the HER kinetics [26,27]. However, formation of these layers requires the synthesis of metal co-catalysts-containing MOF precursors, the thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere and the wet impregnation steps, which are complicated and expensive. Currently there are no facile and general strategies to improve the H2 release capacity of co-catalysts. SrTiO3-based photocatalysts have proved to be the most efficient for photocatalytic OWS with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of almost 100 % [28]. Among them, the co-catalyst Cr2O3/Rh is considered to be a typical, state-of-the-art example of mitigating reverse reactions. The thin amorphous Cr2O3 layer to form a core/shell structure suppresses the reverse reactions as a result of molecular sieving, thus enabling efficient water splitting [29]. The high charge separation efficiency, high stability and reproducibility of catalytic performance make SrTiO3-based photocatalysts the ideal platform photocatalysts for the investigation of co-catalysts for OWS. In this work, Pt co-catalyst decorated SrTiO3 photocatalyst (Pt/STO) was employed as a typical model, on whose surface we introduced a FeOx modifier via photodeposition, a facile and mild method, and observed a considerable increase in the activity and AQE for OWS. It is revealed that incorporating the FeOx modifier facilitates the in-situ conversion of Pt2+ to Pt0 during photocatalytic OWS, and the higher proportion of Pt0 species benefits the electron transfer and hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the temperature programmed desorption-mass spectrum (TPD-MS) characterization unveiled a decreased H atom desorption temperature for FeOx/Pt/STO in comparison to that for Pt/STO, indicating a weaker metal-hydrogen interaction on the FeOx/Pt co-catalyst, which is conducive to H2 release and accordingly OWS reaction. This strategy, also applicable to Rh, Pd, Ru and Ni co-catalysts on STO, is capable to tailor the dynamic evolution and the desorption barrier of hydrogen atom of co-catalysts, thereby boosting OWS on STO photocatalysts. These findings provide insights and an effective modulating strategy for the in-situ dynamic evolution and metal-hydrogen interaction of co-catalysts for photocatalytic OWS. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structural characterizations of photocatalysts The STO semiconductor synthesized via a one-step molten salt method exhibits a typical light absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) region and a nanoparticle morphology with smooth surfaces and varying sizes (Fig. S1). As depicted in Fig. 1 a, the Pt/STO model photocatalyst was acquired by depositing Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the STO surface through a photoreduction method. Further photodeposition of iron oxide (FeOx) species onto Pt/STO resulted in the modified photocatalyst (named FeOx/Pt/STO). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed an even distribution of Pt NPs on the STO surface, with an average size of 2.7 nm (Fig. 1 b-c and Fig. S2). As a comparison, the amorphous FeOx was directly photodeposited on STO giving rise to FeOx/STO, for which the high resolution TEM image evidenced a conformal coating layer of amorphous FeOx on the STO surface (Fig. 1 d). For FeOx/Pt/STO, the observed lattice spacing of 0.226 nm is attributed to the (111) plane of Pt (Fig. 1 e) [30]. The FeOx modifier made minimal change to the morphology of Pt and STO (Fig. S3). The high resolution TEM images, along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping images, showed that the FeOx with a thickness of ∼3 nm was coated on Pt NPs and STO surface (Fig. 1 e-g). The oxide nature of the deposited Fe species was verified by the XPS characterization (Fig. S4). Additionally, TEM images and EDX elemental mapping images unveiled the core/shell structured distribution of Cr2O3 on the surface of Pt NPs and FeOx/Pt NPs for Cr2O3/Pt/STO and Cr2O3/FeOx/Pt/STO samples, respectively (Figs. S5 and S6). To further dissect the surface of Pt co-catalyst, we performed diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption on the FeOx/STO, Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalysts as presented in Fig. 1 f. The absence of peaks on FeOx/STO illustrated that CO was not adsorbed on the surface of FeOx and STO and the peak signals primarily derived from the CO adsorption on the surface of Pt NPs. For Pt/STO, the primary peak between 2010 and 2090 cm−1 is assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt atoms, while the weak peak at ∼ 1827 cm−1 is attributable to bridge-bonded CO species on Pt NPs. The linear adsorption peak can be divided into three peaks at 2079 cm−1, 2063 cm−1 and 2040 cm−1, corresponding to linear CO adsorbed on larger Pt NPs (LNP), smaller Pt NPs (SNP), and low coordinated Pt sites, respectively (LCS) [31–33]. Upon the FeOx decoration, the intensity of the linear and bridge CO adsorption decreases, confirming the deposition of FeOx on the surface of Pt NPs. However, CO chemisorption peaks on Pt still exist with FeOx coating, proving that the surface of Pt NPs is not fully covered and remains accessible to the environment. To compare the distinct effects of Cr2O3 and FeOx modification on Pt co-catalyst, the DRIFTS of CO adsorption was performed on Cr2O3/Pt/STO and Cr2O3/FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalysts (Fig. S7). The intensity of the linear and bridge CO on Pt decreases with Cr2O3 deposited on the surface, but the extent is not so significant compared with FeOx, indicating that it is easier to deposit FeOx than Cr2O3 on the Pt surface. When the Cr2O3 and FeOx are both deposited on the surface of Pt, the peak intensity of CO adsorption further decreases. Analyzing linear adsorption peak-fitting curves provides atomic-scale information on the coating structures of FeOx and Cr2O3 on Pt surface, the linear adsorption peak curves were fitted and analyzed ( Fig. S8 and Table S1). It shows that FeOx is preferentially deposited on larger Pt NPs. After Cr2O3 deposition on Pt, the percentage of LCS decreases from 58.9 % to 47.0 % and from 60.9 % to 45.6 %, respectively for Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO. This fact suggests that these LCS are preferred to be decorated by Cr2O3. 2.2 Photocatalytic OWS reactions STO itself did not produce detectable gases from water splitting under the full spectrum irradiation. However, when Pt NPs were loaded on the surface as co-catalysts, the photocatalyst exhibited observable activity towards stoichiometric water splitting. An initial HER rate of 64 μmol/h from OWS was achieved over Pt/STO with an optimal Pt amount of 0.4 wt% (Fig. S9). However, it rapidly dropped by 47.8 % in the second hour (Fig. S10) due to the reverse reactions [34]. To inhibit the reverse reactions of photocatalytic OWS, the Cr2O3 shell was deposited as an O2 diffusion barrier layer [29]. The amount of the evolved gases for OWS on Cr2O3/Pt/STO showed a better linear relationship to the reaction time and the gases evolution rates were well maintained compared to Pt/STO (Fig. S11). However, the reverse reactions were not completely blocked. The increasement of photocatalytic OWS activity was smaller than that of Cr2O3 modified Rh/STO (Fig. S12a), possibly due to the lower net forward OWS activity of Cr2O3/Pt/STO than that of Cr2O3/Rh/STO photocatalyst (Fig. S12b) [35]. To further improve the performance of Pt/STO for photocatalytic OWS, it is essential to precisely refine the co-catalyst. As Fig. 2 a illustrates, the modification of FeOx species universally boosted photocatalytic OWS on noble metal/STO photocatalysts. Given the widespread utilization of Pt as the HER co-catalyst and the superior performance for photocatalytic OWS demonstrated by FeOx modification, we decided to focus our subsequent research efforts on the FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst. Particularly, the FeOx species substantially enhanced the photocatalytic OWS activity on Pt/STO. The FeOx species alone were almost inactive for OWS, indicating that the active sites for HER still lie on the Pt NPs (Fig. S13). The OWS activity of the FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst increased with increasing FeOx content, reaching the maximum gas evolution rate at 0.25 wt% FeOx content (Fig. S14). Excessive FeOx caused a decline in photocatalytic activity, possibly because some of the reaction sites for photocatalytic OWS were covered [10]. The OWS with H2 and O2 evolution rates of 131 and 65 μmol/h was achieved with the optimal FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst, which is 2 times the rate of Pt/STO. The FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst exhibited stable performance for four cycles (Fig. 2 b-c). In addition, the gas evolution rates of FeOx/Pt/STO can be relatively well-maintained compared to Pt/STO (Fig. S15). The XPS spectra of Fe 2p showed that the spin-orbital peaks remained unchanged after the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the oxidation state and loading amount of FeOx did not change after being used (Fig. S16). These results demonstrate that tailoring the Pt surface by FeOx boosts the photocatalytic OWS. Our previous study proved that the LCS of noble metal co-catalysts represent the highly active centers for the OWS reverse reactions [10]. Evidenced by the DRIFTS of CO adsorption, the decoration of FeOx cannot significantly decrease the percentage of LCS while the deposition of Cr2O3 reduces the ratio of LCS on the surface of Pt co-catalyst. Therefore, FeOx modification cannot inhibit the reverse reactions on Pt/STO, while further depositing Cr2O3 effectively reduces the LCS density and consequently suppresses the reverse reactions, potentially further enhances the OWS activity (Fig. S17). The Cr2O3/FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst realized photocatalytic OWS with a steady H2 evolution rate of ∼ 315 μmol/h (Fig. 2 d), which is three times that of FeOx/Pt/STO. This performance is comparable with that of the benchmark photocatalyst of Cr2O3/Rh/STO (Fig. S18). Fig. 2 e and Table S2 present the AQE of Cr2O3/FeOx/Pt/STO for photocatalytic OWS along with the irradiation wavelength. Compared with the 10 % AQE on FeOx/Pt/STO and 5 % AQE on Pt/STO, the AQE for OWS at 360 nm on Cr2O3/FeOx/Pt/STO reaches ca. 24 % (Fig. S19 and Table S3), which is among the best ones over Pt/STO-based photocatalysts (Table S4). 2.3 Effect of FeOx modification on photocatalytic OWS reaction Control experiments were conducted to elucidate the role of FeOx. Considering that FeOx is unselectively deposited on both the surfaces of Pt NPs and STO, we altered the deposition sequence of Pt NPs and FeOx species to investigate whether the activity enhancement comes from the modification effect of FeOx on the STO surface. Fig. 3 a shows a slight improvement in the photocatalytic OWS activity when FeOx is deposited before Pt NPs. In contrast, the OWS activity is significantly enhanced with FeOx being deposited on the surface of Pt/STO photocatalyst. This indicates that the main contribution to the enhancement is not the passivation effect of the STO surface by FeOx. Characterization of the Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO using XRD, EPR, and XPS also demonstrated that the enhancement in activity due to FeOx is not attributed to surface passivation effects or a decrease in surface defects or states (Fig. S20). For the Pt/FeOx/STO photocatalyst, EDX imaging confirms the deposition of FeOx on the surface of STO rather than of Pt NPs (Fig. 3 b-c). Compared with Pt co-catalyst alone, this structure makes no obvious change in OWS activity. If FeOx was deposited both before and after Pt NPs, the activity was also considerably enhanced. These results manifest that the modification of Pt surface by FeOx is essential for promoting photocatalytic OWS reaction. Moreover, Pt and FeOx were simultaneously photodeposited on the STO surface to form a Pt&FeOx configuration, where FeOx and Pt NPs were in direct contact on the surface (Fig. 3 d-e), leading to a moderate activity increase due to the effective but lowered interfacial contact between FeOx and Pt NPs compared with that of FeOx/Pt. The distinct core–shell structure of FeOx/Pt maximized the contact area, elevating the OWS activity. These findings underscore the significance of the interfacial contact between FeOx and Pt in promoting photocatalytic OWS. 2.4 FeOx-mediated dynamic evolution of Pt co-catalyst in photocatalytic OWS The chemical states of co-catalysts play a crucial role in photocatalytic OWS. Recent research shows that PtOx is not as efficient as metallic Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction, a half reaction of OWS [17,36]. Additionally, the metallic state of Rh, Pd and Ru co-catalysts is more active for H2 evolution than the oxidized state [37,38]. Hence the chemical states of the noble metal co-catalysts (Pt, Rh, Pd) with and without FeOx modification were examined by XPS to gain insights into the role of FeOx ( Fig. S21 ). With FeOx modification, the proportions of metallic valence state for noble metal co-catalysts increase. In the case of Pt/STO, the proportion of Pt0 and Pt2+ is 28.6 % and 56.1 %, respectively (Table S5). FeOx modification increases the percentage of Pt0 in Pt co-catalyst, which is conducive to charge separation and hydrogen evolution. The Pt0 4f peaks of FeOx/Pt/STO shifting to a lower binding energy compared with those of Pt/STO demonstrates that FeOx promotes electron transfer to Pt NPs [39]. Since the photodeposition time for Pt/STO loaded with FeOx and/or Cr2O3 is longer than that for Pt/STO alone, we investigated the relationship between the enhancement of OWS activity and photodeposition time. As shown in Fig. S22, Pt-(2, 4, 6) h/STO photocatalysts exhibit negligible differences in OWS activity, Pt content and Pt valence ratio. These findings suggest that the improvement in OWS activity is attributed to the modification of active sites rather than an extended photodeposition time. Interestingly, there was an induction period for Pt/STO photocatalyst to stoichiometrically split water into H2 and O2. Initially, the ratio of H2/O2 is only ca. 0.75, which progressively increases to 2 in 180 min (Fig. 4 a). It means that not all the photogenerated electrons are leveraged to implement H2 evolution reaction in this process. Pt and Rh co-catalysts have been reported to evolve from oxidized state to metallic state during photocatalytic OWS, which consumes the photogenerated electrons [10,40]. Accordingly, the evolution of Pt co-catalyst via an in-situ photo-reduction reaction is supposed to take place during this process. After 180 min of photo-induction (Fig. S23), the OWS activity of activated Pt/STO is three times that of pristine Pt/STO (Fig. 4 b). In contrast, with the incorporation of FeOx, the induction period is notably reduced to shorter than 30 min (Fig. 4 a). It hints that FeOx modification may expedite the dynamic activation of Pt co-catalyst, which can be attributed to the accelerated charge migration promoting the transition of the Pt valence state. The OWS activity exhibits negligible change upon photo-induction for FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst (Fig. 4b), further corroborating the shortened induction time for the accelerated evolution of Pt co-catalyst by FeOx modification. To characterize the real valence state of Pt co-catalyst on STO during photocatalytic OWS reaction, we conducted quasi-in-situ XPS experiments in the presence of water and illumination using a near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Fig. S24) [10]. For Pt/STO photocatalyst (Fig. 4 c-d and Fig. S25), the percentage of Pt0 was 22.4 %, which is increased to 33.7 % when irradiated in H2O under Ar atmosphere, suggesting that partial Pt NPs are photo-reduced in situ during the photocatalytic OWS process (Table S6). It is consistent with the results of OWS activity tests. This kind of evolution is more pronounced in the photocatalyst decorated with FeOx species (Fig. 4 e-f), where the percentage of Pt0 in FeOx/Pt/STO increase from 42.7 % to 64.1 % upon light irradiation under Ar atmosphere containing water. The photo-induced increase in the proportion of Pt0 for FeOx/Pt/STO reaches 21.4 %, about 1.9 times that of 11.3 % for Pt/STO photocatalyst, proving that FeOx modification facilitates the in-situ photo-reduction of Pt co-catalyst for photocatalytic OWS. We measured the valence state of the Fe species under reaction conditions (Fig. S26). Irradiated in H2O and Ar atmosphere, Fe3+ is partially reduced to Fe2+ by photogenerated electrons, confirming the presence of ferrous species under the operating conditions. Under both dark and light conditions, the Pt0 content is significantly higher in FeOx/Pt/STO than in Pt/STO, indicating that the FeOx decoration enhances the Pt0 proportion and accelerates the evolution of Pt co-catalyst during the reaction. The FeOx modification of non-noble metal Ni also significantly enhances the OWS performance (Fig. S27). However, nickel (Ni), as a HER active center, suffers from poor oxidation resistance [41]. In-situ XPS revealed that FeOx modification effectively prevents Ni from being oxidized during the photocatalytic reaction and further promotes its in-situ photo-reduction process (Fig. S28). These results demonstrate that the FeOx modification promotes the in-situ activation of co-catalyst by effectively prompting electrons transfer from STO to Pt and Ni NPs, thus boosting photocatalytic OWS. The effect of Cr2O3 deposition on Pt co-catalyst was also checked by XPS. The proportion of metallic Pt in Pt/STO photocatalyst decreases with photodeposition of Cr2O3, elucidating that Cr2O3 cannot expedite the in-situ evolution of Pt co-catalyst (Fig. S29). The primary role of Cr2O3 is to inhibit the reverse reactions, which, however, is not completely blocked. The preferential but incomplete deposition of Cr2O3 on the LCS of Pt NPs gives rise to the partial suppression of the reverse reactions, which is evidenced by the residual DRIFTS peaks of CO adsorption and the corresponding fitting analysis. Additionally, Cr2O3 is positioned on both the surfaces of Pt and STO for Pt/STO photocatalyst, while mainly on the Pt surface for FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst. As the deposition of Cr2O3 proceeds via a reduction step involving photogenerated electrons, it is deduced that FeOx modification enriches the electrons on the surface of Pt co-catalyst. Furthermore, the CO DRIFTS analysis reveals an increased coverage on the surface sites of Pt co-catalyst by FeOx modification. These results, together with in-situ XPS characterizations, integrally conclude that FeOx modification promotes the dynamic evolution of Pt co-catalyst from PtOx to Pt0, thereby boosting the photocatalytic OWS reaction. 2.5 Mechanism for the promotion of photocatalytic OWS by FeOx modification To explore the mechanism underlying the promotion of OWS, the effects of FeOx modification on the charge carrier dynamics and surface reaction behavior over Pt/STO photocatalyst were investigated in the following discussion. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is a powerful tool to characterize the behavior of photoexcited charge carriers. Among the tested samples, FeOx/Pt/STO demonstrates the lowest PL intensity, suggesting the most efficient separation and transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes (Fig. 5 a) [42]. The fluorescence intensity of FeOx/STO was almost unchanged from that of STO, indicating that the surface modification of Pt by FeOx was beneficial to charge separation. Furthermore, nanosecond (ns)-level time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was recorded on Pt/STO photocatalyst with and without FeOx modification (Fig. 5 b and Fig. S30). The fast decay component (τ1), which is mainly contributed by the radiative pathways, is attributed to the electron trapping into the photocatalyst surface. The slow component (τ2), which reflects the nonradiative process, mainly originates from the electron-hole recombination [43,44]. The τ1 and τ2 of FeOx/Pt/STO are shorter than that of Pt/STO, implying more unhindered photogenerated charge migration over FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst. On the other hand, with introduction of FeOx, the τ2 of FeOx/Pt/STO decreases, revealing an effective interfacial charge transfer process. The average fluorescence lifetime (τave) of pure Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO was calculated to be 1.4 and 1.2 ns, respectively. This reduced time constant of the fast decay process indicates an accelerated charge transfer from STO near-surface and shallow bulk regions to co-catalyst due to FeOx modification [34].The surface charge-transfer efficiency (ηtrans) of STO-based photocathodes was estimated by measuring the photocurrent density in the electrolyte of Na2SO4 with and without [Fe(CN)6]3– as an electron scavenger, which is supposed to consume all the electrons (Fig. 5 c) [45]. Fig. 5 d shows that FeOx/Pt/STO achieves the highest surface charge-transfer efficiency (ca. 69.1 %), consistent with the XPS and OWS activity results. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that FeOx/Pt/STO with the smallest impedance circle exhibits an expedited charge transport within the bulk and across the surface (Fig. S31) [46]. These enhanced charge carrier dynamics are attributed to FeOx-induced high content of Pt0 in FeOx/Pt/STO photocatalyst. The function of FeOx was further studied through photocatalytic H2 or O2 evolution half reaction, utilizing methanol or silver nitrate as sacrificial agents, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the HER activity of FeOx/Pt/STO is twice that of Pt/STO, whereas the OER activities for the two photocatalysts are almost identical. The considerable increase in the HER activity may be ascribed to the refined surface reaction behaviour [41]. The photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution rates were observed to follow the Arrhenius equation within the temperature range of 278–293 K (Fig. S32). The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the OWS reaction on Pt/STO is determined to be 8.51 kJ/mol, comparable to previously reported results ( Fig. S33 ) [41,47,48]. Significantly, the Ea for FeOx/Pt/STO is substantially lowered to 4.0 kJ/mol, only 47 % of that for Pt/STO, indicating a reduced reaction barrier for OWS. Furthermore, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements for electrochemical HER, as depicted in Fig. 5 c demonstrate that the photocurrent density evidently increases when the Pt0 proportion is increased by FeOx modification. Conversely, FeOx has minimal effect on OER process ( Fig. S34 ). These findings align well with the results of photocatalytic activity tests, highlighting the exclusive promotion of FeOx modification on HER process. Additionally, the photoelectrochemical current density for HER on FeOx/Pt/STO is 4 times higher than that of Pt/STO (Fig. 6 b), which is consistent with the previous results in this work. Hydrogen adsorption on STO, Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO was studied by TPD methods with H2 saturated adsorption as shown in Fig. 6 c-d. There is H atom adsorption on the surface of bare STO, but the adsorption amount is almost negligible compared with Pt/STO and FeOx/Pt/STO. After loading the co-catalyst, the H2-TPD signal is increased, indicating that H atom is mainly adsorbed on the Pt surface. The intensity of H2 TPD and MS signal decreases with the modification of FeOx on Pt co-catalyst, further confirming the deposition of FeOx on the surface of Pt NPs. On Pt/STO, the H2 TPD peak appears at 288.4 K, which is mainly attributed to H atom adsorbed on bare Pt(111) surfaces [49]. Upon the FeOx modification, the intensity of H2 TPD peak shifts to 274.7 K. The MS results are consistent with the TPD experiment. The FeOx modification of Ni enhances the OWS performance, with trends observed in the H2-TPD and MS experiments suggesting a possible change in the Ni-H interaction (Fig. S35). The decreased H atom desorption temperature indicates a reduced adsorption of H atom on the surface of Pt co-catalyst, revealing the Pt-H interaction being weakened by FeOx modification. FeOx modulates the electronic structure of Pt surface to become a better H2 release site, which promotes HER and OWS via photocatalysis. Based on the above results, a plausible mechanism for FeOx-promoted OWS on Pt/STO photocatalyst is proposed in Fig. 7 . Upon irradiation, photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt co-catalyst to reduce protons into H2, while photogenerated holes migrate to the surface of STO to oxidize H2O to O2. The dynamic evolution of Pt co-catalyst from PtOx to metallic Pt is an essential process for photocatalytic OWS on Pt/STO, accelerating the charge transfer and H2 evolution reaction (Fig. 7 a). FeOx modification significantly shortens the induction time for this evolution from 180 min to less than 30 min and improves the content of metallic Pt in the evolved photocatalyst from 33.7 % to 64.1 % which enables higher efficiency of charge separation and transfer of Pt/STO-based photocatalysts (Fig. 7 b). When formed on the active sites of the HER co-catalyst, H2 molecules have to detach from the surface to complete the HER step, where the metal-hydrogen interaction plays a role. The FeOx modifier weakens Pt-H interaction and consequently reduces the barrier for H2 molecules desorption, promoting the release of produced H2 molecules for HER during photocatalytic OWS. 3 Conclusion Comparative photocatalysis and electrocatalysis experiments, alongside XPS, PL spectroscopy and TPD-MS characterizations, demonstrate that the dynamic activation of Pt co-catalyst from PtOx to metallic Pt and swift desorption of produced H2 molecules are essential to expedite charge transfer and surface HER process for OWS on Pt/STO-based photocatalysts. We developed a facile and general effective strategy of photodepositing FeOx to promote this dynamic evolution of Pt co-catalyst and the surface H release, which significantly boosts the photocatalytic OWS with the activity doubled relative to that of Pt/STO photocatalyst. This work deepens our understanding of the in-situ dynamic evolution of co-catalysts and appropriate metal-hydrogen interaction for photocatalytic OWS, and delivers a universal approach to modulate them, boosting the development of high-efficiency OWS photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis. 4 Experimental section 4.1 Catalyst preparation The STO powder was synthesized by a solid-phase molten salt method [50]. Pt was deposited on the STO by photodeposition method to obtain the photocatalyst Pt/STO. Typically, STO powder was immersed in H2PtCl6 aqueous solution. Subsequently, the solution was evacuated for 30 min to remove the air and irradiated by full spectrum light for 2 h, after which the powder was centrifuged and washed for several times. Following this, the powder was dried at 333 K to obtain Pt/STO. Then FeOx species were deposited on the Pt/STO by the addition of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sinopharm), evacuated for 30 min to remove air and irradiated with 300 W xenon lamp without an optical filter for 30 min. The Cr2O3 layer were photodeposited on the catalyst by the addition of K2CrO4 (0.1 wt%). 4.2 Characterization UV–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550) equipped with an integrating sphere. The diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption on photocatalysts was recorded on a Nicolet iS50 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a wide-band mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT-A) detector. The samples were first pretreated at 200 °C by 10 % H2 for 30 min before collecting the background spectra in a flow of 30 ml min−1 of N2 at 30 °C. CO adsorption spectra were collected after treatment by 30 ml min−1 of 1 % CO, followed by a flow of 30 ml min−1 of N2 to remove physically adsorbed CO. The morphologies of photocatalysts were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi HF 2000 and JEOL 4000EX transmission electron microscopes). Elemental mapping was conducted on a HR-TEM (JEOL-2000). The morphology and element distribution were also detected by high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) images. The HAADF images and compositional maps were taken on a probe-corrected JEM-ARM200F electron microscope equipped with EDX. The steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were recorded on a FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) in air at room temperature, with the powder samples prepared by the pellet pressing method. The valence states of Pt and Fe were checked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Esclab 250Xi, a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source) with the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) as the reference. EPR experiments were carried out on a Bruker A200 spectrometer. The experimental temperatures applied were typically 110 and 295 K. 4.3 Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The photocatalysts were fabricated as described above. Quasi in situ XPS was conducted using a near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS EnviroESCA) [10]. Argon at a flow rate of 30 ml min−1 was used as the background atmosphere. The pressure of the chamber was kept at 100 Pa. The partial pressure of water vapor was 3.14 Pa and the partial pressure of Ar was 96.86pa. Argon was flowed through the chamber and then XPS spectra were recorded under dark conditions using monochromatic Al Kα irradiation (1486.7 eV) from an Al anode operated at 50 W. Spectra were acquired with a pass energy of 40 eV, step size of 0.05 eV, and dwell time of 0.1 s. XPS spectra were recorded under light irradiation in H2O/Ar by passing Ar through a water bubbler before flowing into the chamber; the sample was irradiated with 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an optical fibre. The XPS spectra were analyzed using XPSPEAK software. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1 s photoelectron peak at 284.8 eV. The process typically begins with subtracting the background signal using the Shirley methodto eliminate the influence of inelastic scattering. Following this step, the Pt 4f peaks are often fitted using a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian line shapes. The fitting procedure may require multiple sets of the spin–orbit pairs between the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 components, and these are separated by approximately 3.3 eV and have a peak area ratio of 4:3. These constraints were summarized in the Table S7. 4.4 Photocatalytic water splitting Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a Pyrex top-irradiation-type reaction vessel connected to a closed gas circulation system. The reaction solution contained 100 ml deionized water and 50 mg photocatalyst. The reaction solution was evacuated for 30 min to completely remove air and then irradiated through the top of the vessel using 300 W Xe lamp without an optical filter. The temperature of the reaction solution was kept at 288 K using a flow of cooling water. The gaseous products were analysed by gas chromatography (Agilent, GC-7890A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier). 4.5 The photon distribution and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement The photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry and AP-XPS use a 300 W xenon lamp. The light source used for the AQE test is a monochromatic xenon lamp sent through a band pass filter with a central wavelength of 360 nm, 365 nm or 380 nm (Yi Zhao Photonics). Photon intensity distribution is shown in Fig. S36 . The number of photons is tested using a calibrated Si photodiode (LS-100, EKO Instruments Co., LTD. The details of the measurement are shown in Fig. S37 . The AQE values were determined according to the following equation: A Q E % = 2 ∗ N H 2 N p h o t o n s ∗ 100 where N(H2) and N(photons) denote the number of H2 molecules produced and the number of photons reaching the surface of the reaction solution, respectively. The number of photons with central wavelengths of 360 nm, 365 nm and 380 nm is estimated to be 8.71*1018 photons h−1, 8.86*1018 photons h−1 and 1.32*1019 photons h−1. 4.6 Electrochemical characterization Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out by using the CHI 760E electrochemical analyzer with a conventional three electrode cell. A 2 × 1 cm2 FTO photoelectrode deposited samples, a Pt foil as the counter electrode and a SCE as the reference electrode. The measured potentials versus SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation: VRHE = VSCE + 0.242 + 0.059 × pH. All potentials are quoted against the RHE unless otherwise noted. The electrolyte consists of 0.5 M Na2SO4. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at −0.2 V with the range from 0.1 Hz to 100000 Hz under irradiation. Photocurrents were measured at −0.6 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured from −0.2 to − 0.8 V at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The electrolyte consists of 0.5 M Na2SO4, and 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]. The photocurrent density arising from PEC water reduction can be described as: J H 2 O = J a b s ∗ J s e p ∗ J t r a n s where ηsep is the charge-separation efficiency, and ηtrans is the surface charge-transfer efficiency. With K3[Fe(CN)6] as an electron scavenger, supposing the electrons were 100 % consumed in electrolyte with [Fe(CN)6]3– anions [45], the surface recombination was eliminated, and the photocurrent density at a potential of −0.8 V can be described as: J K 3 [ F e ( C N ) 6 ] = J a b s ∗ J s e p So, the ηtrans can be described as: η t r a n s = ( J H 2 O ) / J K 3 [ F e ( C N ) 6 ] 4.7 The surface reaction The surface reaction studies were carried out at different temperatures under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation, and the apparent activation energy of the reaction system was determined. The solution temperature was maintained stable by a thermostat during the reaction. Gas phase analysis was carried out by gas chromatograph. The temperature range is 281 ∼ 293 K. A linear correlation was observed in the Arrhenius plot, and the apparent activation energy of the reaction system was determined by the slope of the plot. The calculation formula of apparent activation energy is as follows: lnK = - Ea RT + l n A Reaction conditions: 0.05 g photocatalyst; 100 ml water; reaction temperature, 281–293 K; light source, 300 W Xe lamp. 4.8 The H2-TPD The temperature-programmed desorption of the preadsorbed H2 (H2-TPD) was performed on Micromeritics Autochem 2920 coupling with a mass spectrometer (HIDEN). Typically, 176 mg catalyst was heated in-situ at 573 K for 30 min under He stream with a flow rate of 30 ml/min. After cooling to 303 K, the catalyst was exposed to pure H2 stream with a flow rate of 30 ml/min for 30 min, and then flushed by He stream with a flow rate of 30 ml/min for 30 min to remove the physisorbed molecules. Ultimately, the TPD measurements were performed from 183 K to 313 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min after obtaining a stable baseline, and the desorbed H2 was monitored by a TCD, and the m/z = 2 signals in the coupled mass spectrometer was used to obtain the corresponding H2 desorption profiles. 4.9 The error bars and SD of all measurements For the photocatalytic and fluorescence experiments, each was repeated three times to ensure reproducibility of results, and the reported values are the averages of these three replicates. The error bars represent the standard deviation of these measurements. A total of 150Pt NPs were measured using ImageJ software, and their average and standard deviation were calculated. For XPS and electrochemical tests, experiments were repeated twice, and the article reports the average values for these tests.

        "dc:description": "Sunlight-driven overall water splitting (OWS) using particulate photocatalysts presents a promising strategy for a sustainable clean energy supply. Noble metals like platinum (Pt) are frequently employed as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) co-catalyst for photocatalytic OWS reaction. However, understandings on the dynamic evolution of co-catalysts during photocatalytic OWS remain poor and there lacks effective approaches to mediate this process as well as the metal-hydrogen interaction for efficient H2 evolution. In this work, using Pt/SrTiO3 photocatalyst as a model, we studied the change of Pt co-catalyst from PtOx to metallic Pt, and developed an amorphous FeOx modifier to promote this process by accelerating charge transfer to stabilize Pt in its metallic state, thereby thermodynamically facilitating HER by maintaining the Pt potential within a favorable range. Additionally, it weakens the Pt-H interaction, thereby promoting product release during photocatalytic OWS. This modification of amorphous FeOx exhibits universality on various noble metals co-catalysts such as Rh, Pd, Ru and Ni, paving the way for constructing efficient co-catalysts in photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry.",
