Graphical abstract Exploring low-cost, non-noble hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with remarkable activity in both acidic and alkaline media still remains an enormous challenge. Herein, a novel V8C7 NMs/GR heterogeneous catalyst has been synthesized by epitaxial growth of graphene as efficient acidic and alkaline HER electrocatalyst, for the first time. Electrochemical tests and DFT calculations indicate that high-activity of the exposed facet and low barrier energy for hydrogen adsorption and water dissociation could facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction. Owing to the electronic interactions between V8C7 and graphene at active hybrid interfaces, this catalyst shows high HER activity with a low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (156 mV in 1 M KOH and 52 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4), a small Tafel slope (89.4 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH and 48.3 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4), and preferable durability in both acidic and alkaline media. This work opens up a new avenue for the epitaxial growth of graphene and exploring new-type active heterogeneous catalysts with advanced performance for HER. Keywords Heterostructure Epitaxial growth Electronic interactions Hydrogen evolution reaction DFT calculations To avoid the haze contamination and energy crisis, fuel vehicles will be banned to be sold in the near future. Therewith, electricity will gradually replace fossil fuels as a source of automotive power. Fuel cell, a clean and sustainable cell with high energy conversion efficiency, has long been the ideal automotive battery. Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier for the fuel cells, owing to possessing high-energy density and zero carbon emission when burned in the oxygen [1]. Up to now, electrochemical water splitting is one of the most efficient strategies to generate molecular hydrogen [2]. Unfortunately, platinum (Pt) and Pt-based materials have been deemed as the most effective catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to high electricity-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, whereas their high cost and scarce elemental abundance hamper their extensive applications [3]. Hence, many earth-abundant non-Pt alternatives have been studied as HER catalysts. Though some electrocatalysts, such as Ni, Fe, Mo, Co-based materials, show a high HER activity alongside good stability, their characteristics still are not a patch on Pt-based materials. Thus, the development of cost-effective materials with desired electrocatalytic activity and stability remains many challenges. “Platinum-like behavior” of transition metal carbides (TMCs) was firstly reported by Levy and Boudart. In this research, carbon could modify the surface electronic properties of tungsten atoms in a platinum-like manner, which makes H atom adsorbed relatively more strongly on the surface of tungsten carbide than on the clean metal surface [4]. WC [5] and MoC [6], of which the d-electron count are nearly like the d-electron count of Pt [7], have been two of the substantially studied TMCs for the HER. However, group VB metal (V, Nb, and Ta) carbides are rarely reported for the HER, especially Vanadium (V), which has richer elemental abundance and smaller relative atomic mass [8]. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the hybridization between the d-orbitals of vanadium atoms and the s- and p-orbitals of carbon atoms, results in an expansion in the d-band structure, forming the Pt-like properties that process lower electric resistivity than Mo2C and semblable hydrogen binding energy with WC and Mo2C [7,9,10]. Therefore, this provides a theoretical direction for vanadium carbide as a potential electrocatalytic material for HER. Unfortunately, the poor corrosion resistance hardly satisfies the practical application. To overcome this issue, modifying suitably the surface structure of catalysts is a plausible approach to efficiently prevent the catalyst from being eroded. Meanwhile, forming a high-energy interfacial structure could intensify catalytic capability by enhancing the charge transport and promoting absorption of reactants [11–13]. Therefore, we expect that using vanadium carbide as a substrate to form a heterostructure with high activity sites exposure, could enhances its HER activity and stability. In this communication, on the basis of previous work [14], we innovatively report a one-step process to synthesize the heterogeneous catalyst composed of V8C7 nanomeshs and highly conductive graphene (V8C7 NMs/GR) by epitaxial growth for the first time. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis process of V8C7 NMs/GR by the precursor of Zn3(OH)2(V2O7)(H2O)2. With the high annealing temperature, the occupying positions of vanadium atoms slightly diverge off the ideal fcc positions, which forms the non-stoichiometry V8C7 crystallizing in the space group P4332 with vast carbon defects and significantly increased edge active sites [15,16]. Consequently, in contrast with the ordinary vanadium carbide, V8C7 is more attractive as a HER catalyst. In addition, to date, several kinds of materials, such as SiC [17], Ni [18] and Cu [19], could be potential templates for synthesizing epitaxial graphene, due to their similar crystal lattice and surface feature with graphite. Herein, we have synthesized V8C7 exposing the highly-active facet (0 2  3 ¯ ), in which the (4 0 0) crystal face matches well with the (1 0 0) crystal face of graphene, owing to low crystal-mismatch strategy. The results suggest that graphene could be prone to growing on the specific crystal face of vanadium carbide (as a substrate) by epitaxial growth. Experiment and theoretical calculations both prove the existence of electron-electron interactions between V8C7 and graphene, which markedly enhances the charge transfer efficiency in hydrogen generation electrocatalytic processes. For the obtained porous nanostructure, the catalysts can contact well with electrolyte [20]. Compared with other transition metal compounds, the final material shows more attractive HER performances in both acidic and alkaline media. The morphology and the structure of V8C7 NMs/GR are demonstrated by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM). The porous heterostructure of V8C7 NMs/GR with a nanoscale thickness (about 52 nm) is respectively displayed in Fig. 1 a, b and Fig. S1a at different magnifications. Different from V8C7 nanomeshs (V8C7 NMs), V8C7 NMs/GR shows the visible heterogeneous structure on the surface of V8C7 by SEM and TEM images (Fig. S1b–e). The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image describes the almost identical lattice spacing (both ∼0.21 nm) of V8C7 and graphene in Fig. 1c, corresponding to the lattice plane of V8C7 (4 0 0) and graphene (1 0 0), respectively. The close binding interface between V8C7 and two-dimensional layered graphene is also observed by HRTEM in Fig. 1d–f. The results suggest a desired thickness (about 0.69–0.74 nm, two layers of graphene), which is in good agreement with the results of Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) detection (Fig. S2). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image further reveals the highly coherent relationship between the crystal lattice orientation of V8C7 (4 0 0) and graphene (1 0 0) (Fig. 1g), suggesting that graphene could orderly grow along the crystal lattice of V8C7 and has a strong interaction with V8C7 rather than just a simple mechanical combination. The cubic crystal of V8C7 and the hexagonal crystal of graphene are clearly displayed in Fig. S1f, g by fast fourier transform (FFT), presenting their well single crystal structure. These results reveal that the lower crystal-mismatch strategy [21] between the lattice plane of the two materials could contribute to the single crystalline graphene layer epitaxially growing on the single crystal substrate —V8C7. Seeing from the images in Fig. S3a, b, though the surface of vanadium carbide is not a complete two-dimensional plane, the (0 2  3 ¯ ) plane of V8C7 NMs/GR appears as twin crystals on different horizontal planes, indicating the vanadium carbide surface is exposed to (0 2  3 ¯ ) single crystal surface. Moreover, the HAADF-STEM images and corresponding SAED images of pure V8C7 NMs are shown in Fig. S3c, d, which further illustrates the exposure of (0 2  3 ¯ ) facet of V8C7. The high-brightness diffraction spots exhibited by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1h) represent the lattice plane overlap of two kinds material, just corresponding to the (0 2  3 ¯ ) plane of V8C7 and the (0 0 1) plane of graphene, deeply revealing that the (4 0 0) crystal lattice of V8C7 matches well with the (1 0 0) crystal lattice of graphene. However, V8C7 with other lattice plane exposed, synthesized by commercial NH4VO3 as the precursor, tends to be enveloped by a lower degree of crystallinity (or covered by amorphous carbon) and thicker size of carbon layer (V8C7@C) (see Fig. S4). The results indicate that the growth of high-quality graphene requires not only deposition of carbon atoms by the decomposition of reductive gas (CH4), but the lattice matching between graphene and V8C7. The energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 1i–k) analysis confirms the material composed of V and C. Additionally, distribution of C further indicates that heterogenous graphene exists on the surface of V8C7. The porous nanostructure of V8C7 is formed by a precursor containing zinc element. The XRD pattern of precursor is shown in Fig. S5. Zn is primarily used as a sacrificial template by doping to form the nanomesh structure. As displayed in Table S4, the Zn has completely evaporated at 900 °C. Besides, the diffraction peaks of V8C7 NMs/GR could be indentified to cubic V8C7 (JCPDS No. 89-1096) in Fig. 2 a. Specifically, the typical diffraction peaks indexing to the (3 2 0), (5 2 0), and (5 4 2) planes confirm the successful synthesis of V8C7. However, the formed weak hump at around 26.4° of V8C7 NMs/GR is assigned to (1 0 0) plane of graphene (JCPDS No. 00-041-1487), indicating that graphene exists in the V8C7 nanostructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is recorded to further survey surface and interfacial structure of the material. The full spectra of the V8C7 NMs/GR and the corresponding high-resolution spectra of C 1s and V 2p are plotted in Fig. 2b–d. For the V8C7 NMs, two peaks at 512.9 and 520.6 eV are displayed in the spectra, respectively corresponding to V 2p3/2 (VC bond) and V 2p1/2, as well as 514 and 515.6 eV corresponding to VO bond. Two peaks at 282.8 and 284.6 eV are observed in Fig. 2d, corresponding to CV bond and CC bond, respectively. Furthermore, a weak peak of C 1s appearing near 253.1 eV corresponds to VO bond [3,22]. The C-V bond and V-C band jointly prove the successful fabrication of vanadium carbide [10]. However, for the V8C7 NMs/GR, the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 shift to 513.2 and 520.9 eV, respectively. The binding energies of CV and CC bond slightly shift to 282.6 and 284.4 eV. This negative shift of binging energy indicates that a few electrons transfer from V8C7 to graphene. The existence of non-negligible electronic interactions between V8C7 and graphene may induce the reactivity change on the interface of V8C7. Subsequently, to reveal the structure of epitaxial graphene on the surface of V8C7, the corresponding Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. S6a. Typically, the peaks of D-band and G-band locate at 1316 cm−1 and 1577 cm−1. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) is about 0.24, indicating that the carbon component in the as-obtained V8C7 NMs/GR has high degree of graphitization. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) date verify the specific surface area (36.12 m2 g−1) and mesoporous feature of V8C7 NMs/GR (Fig. S6b). Next, we evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of V8C7 NMs/GR for HER using a three-electrode cell in 1 M KOH solution. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activity of V8C7 NMs, V8C7@C, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and bare carbon black are also investigated as benchmarks under the same conditions in Fig. 3 . The polarization curve of V8C7 NMs/GR shows a low U onset value of approximately −20 mV (vs. RHE, all the potentials are referenced to RHE in this work) and a small overpotential of 156 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10), which is closer to that of 86 mV for Pt/C. In addition, V8C7 NMs/GR possesses the lower hydrogen potential than that of Pt/C when the current density is greater than 41 mA cm−2, suggesting higher HER activity than Pt/C. Further compared with overpotential of other HER electrocatalysts under the same conditions, such as c-CoSe2/CC (190 mV) [23], CoP/CC (209 mV) [24], MoB (207 mV) and Mo2C (189 mV) [25], V8C7 NMs/GR exhibits lower overpotential. Legibly, as shown in Fig. 3b, V8C7 NMs/GR has higher hydrogen evolution efficiency than that of Pt/C when potential is only greater than 255 mV. The HER kinetics of the electrocatalysts are reflected by the Tafel slopes in Fig. 3c. The Tafel slope of V8C7 NMs/GR is about 89.4 mV dec−1, illustrating the Volemr-Heyrovsky HER mechanism [26]. Compared to V8C7 NMs and V8C7@C, V8C7 NMs/GR exhibits more excellent performance for electrocatalysis, which could be ascribed to the interfacial interactions between the highly conductive graphene and V8C7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots fitted with the equivalent circuit are collected in Fig. 3d. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of V8C7 NMs/GR is about 12 Ω, which is much smaller than that of the other electrocatalysts, indicting a highly charge transport kinetics for HER. Atomic-layered graphene with high crystallinity possesses extremely high charge transfer rate, which significantly decreases the Rct of V8C7 NMs/GR. Moreover, V8C7 NMs/GR with graphene partially covered will be easier to expose highly active sites on the surface of V8C7 and the interface of V8C7 with graphene, which could enhance the HER activity. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) reveals the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of V8C7 NMs/GR in Fig. S7. Obviously, V8C7 NMs/GR (38.71 mF cm−2) has higher electrocatalytic activity surface areas than V8C7 NMs (27.28 mF cm−2) and V8C7@C (3.29 mF cm−2). Therewith, the durability of V8C7 NMs/GR is probed by CV test at a scanning 5 mV s−1 and continuous 83 h electrolysis reaction. The polarization curves of initial cycle and after 2500 cycles listed in Fig. 3e show a negligible shift for the overpotential. After continuous 83 h electrolysis reaction, the overpotential of V8C7 NMs/GR only changes 8 mV more than that of V8C7 NMs (70 mV) in alkaline electrolyte, and the catalytic activity still remains at 95% of versus the original state. The high durability may be ascribed to the heterogeneous graphene covering the surface of V8C7, effectively preventing the corrosion of V8C7 in electrolyte solution [27,28]. To further evaluate the potential electrochemical properties of these samples at wide pH values, the polarization curves of these electrocatalysts are investigated at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution in Fig. 4 a. V8C7 NMs/GR shows a near zero U onset value of only −14 mV. Importantly, V8C7 NMs/GR has an overpotential of 52 mV at η10, which is superior to other transition metal compounds, such as WSe2@CNF (158 mV) [29], NiP (121 mV) [30], Co2P (134 mV) [31], and MoCX (142 mV) [32]. The Tafel slope of V8C7 NMs/GR is 48.3 mV dec−1, highlighting its superior HER kinetic (Volemr-Heyrovsky HER mechanism) [26] in Fig. 4b. Remarkably, the Tafel slope of V8C7 NMs/GR is much better than that of other HER catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution as shown in Table S6. V8C7 NMs/GR lists a small Rct value approximately 23 Ω at the overpotential of 200 mV (Fig. 4c), revealing a high charge and mass transfer efficiency. The capacitance values and ECSA of V8C7 NMs/GR, V8C7 NMs and V8C7@C are calculated and summarized in Table S5. Additionally, the specific HER activity is calculated via normalizing the current by the corresponding ECSA. We plot the polarization curves normalized by ECSA of these electrocatalysts in both acidic and alkaline media. As displayed in Figure S8, the obviously high value of V8C7 NMs/GR still displays the best HER activity among all Electrocatalysts, which confirms the intrinsic optimization of active sites on heterointerfaces. In addition, the LSV of V8C7 NMs/GR shifts slightly by only 10 mV at Ƞ10 after 2500 cycles. After continuous 83 h electrolysis reaction, V8C7 NMs/GR reflects desired durability in Fig. 4d. Compared with the poor durability of V8C7 NMs, the corrosion resistance of V8C7 NMs/GR is enhanced notably, further proving the auxo-action of graphene heterojunction for the stability of V8C7. Further, the XRD patterns of post-HER prove V8C7 NMs/GR still maintains the primary crystalline structure after long-term durability test in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte (see Fig. S9), revealing the excellent stability of V8C7 NMs/GR. All the above electrochemical performances demonstrate the potential of V8C7 NMs/GR electrocatalyst for HER in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte. The intrinsic electronic structure and the catalytic activities of V8C7 NMs/GR in acidic and alkaline HER are investigated by DFT computation. Fig. S10a shows the process of water activation and hydrogen generation on V8C7 NMs and V8C7 NMs/GR, respectively. The catalyst sites of water dissociation and hydrogen production are revealed on the margin of V8C7 with graphene heterojunction. Besides, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH *) is accepted as a strong descriptor for the hydrogen generation step. The adopted adsorption sites of H* models in acidic media are exhibited in Fig. S11. The computational studies show V8C7 NMs has a negative ΔGH * value of 0.175 eV in acidic electrolyte. Conversely, V8C7 NMs/GR yields an optimal ΔGH * value of −0.06 eV, which is analogous with that of Pt (Fig. 4e). The outstanding HER catalytic activity of V8C7 NMs/GR indicates that the interaction of heterojunction significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity for HER, owing to the existence of electronic transfer between V8C7 and graphene (confirmed in Fig. S10b). Moreover, the reaction pathways of V8C7 NMs and the obtained heterostructure for alkaline HER are shown in Fig. 4f. Remarkably, compared to sluggish HER kinetics of V8C7 NMs, V8C7 NMs/GR exhibits favorable activated water adsorption energy (ΔGH-OH = 0.47 eV) and hydrogen adsorption energy (ΔGH * = −0.46 eV), accelerating the dissociation of water and the production of subsequent hydrogen, respectively. In short, DFT calculations further corroborate that the cooperation between V8C7 and graphene can effectively accelerate the sluggish acidic and alkaline HER kinetics. In conclusion, V8C7 NMs/GR heterogeneous catalyst is firstly synthesized by epitaxial growth of graphene on the special crystal face of V8C7. V8C7 NMs/GR, exposed with highly active (0 2  3 ¯ ) facet, can serve as an excellent electrocatalyst for HER in both acidic and alkaline media. Ascribed to the strong electronic interactions between V8C7 and graphene, the energy barriers of hydrogen generation are dramatically reduced. The hybrid catalyst shows a low overpotential of 52 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 48.3 mV dec−1 in acidic media, as well as attractive overpotential of 156 mV and Tafel slope of 89.4 mV dec−1 in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the heterostructure exhibits a preferable durability in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte as well. As an non-noble electrocatalytic material, V8C7 NMs/GR possesses a Pt-like electrocatalytic activity, which is superior to the ordinary vanadium carbide and other transition metal carbides. Until now, the epitaxial growth of graphene heterojunction based on 2D nano-materials is still in its infancy, so a facile approach, epitaxial growth of graphene on the crystal plane of V8C7, also opens up a new avenue for the synthesis of graphene.
