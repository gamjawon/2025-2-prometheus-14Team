HAYEK Institut fur Physikalische Chemie, Universitat Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck (Austria) Summary Thin film model catalysts are very useful in heterogeneous catalysis because they are easily characterised by electron microscopy. On the other hand, single crystal studies under clean conditions have contributed signif- icantly to the understanding of structural effects in hydrocarbon reactions. For some reaction systems the experimental agreement between single crystals and dispersed catalysts is good, but for most of the demanding reactions a rather poor correlation is observed. This problem was tackled by preparing 'oriented' thin film catalysts (Pt/Al203) as an intermediate approach between single crystals and thin island films. The films consist of nearly perfect micro single crystals surrounded by the carrier film and exposing only one plane to the ambient. The treatment in oxygen and hydrogen necessary to induce catalytic activity leads generally to a facetting of the surface, introducing steps and other specific surface sites. On the basis of electron microscopic data, it is discussed how these treatments can influence the structure of oriented and of non-oriented films. Experimental kinetic data concerning both the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and the isomerisation of neopentane on Pt/Al203 are reviewed, and a connection between the surface structure and the selectivity is tentatively established. Introduction The sensitivity of a reaction to the dispersion of the metal and to the crystallographic orientation of the catalyst surface is one of the most discussed topics in the catalysis of heterogeneous reactions. In the past, mainly two different approaches have been attempted: Studies of the reaction kinetics on single crystal surfaces (low index planes or stepped) under uhv conditions or in uhv-compatible high pressure cells have provided insight into the mechanism of some reactions involving less complex mole- cules. In particular, surface sensitive techniques have been successful in exploring several facile reactions such as methanation on Ni [I], CO oxida- tion on Pd [2], Rh and Ru [3], hydrogenation of several hydrocarbons [4] etc. Studies of skeletal hydrocarbon reactions of the demanding type on 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 348 single crystal surfaces [5-7] have established that the catalytic activity is in some way connected to the type and to the number of steps and of other defects on the surface, but the correlation with experimental results on supported metal catalysts is limited. The second approach makes use of evaporated metal films as model systems for supported metal catalysts, and seems appropriate for reactions where particle size as well as support effects are involved. Thin film model catalysts can be very well characterised by electron microscopy. Surface- specific techniques, in particular-those compatible with ultrahigh vacuum, can be applied to a limited extent only. In the study of demanding reactions, in addition to the assessment of pure support effects it is necessary to obtain detailed information on the nature of exposed faces, of facets and steps, of particular surface sites, and of the boundary metal particle-support. Therefore, it seems appropriate to use catalyst particles of definite crystallographic shape. Since the classical experiments by Anderson and Avery [8], epitaxially grown crystallites have been repeatedly used as model catalysts of known surface geometry. Crystallites of well-defined shape can also be obtained by heating and sintering processes [9]. In both cases the faces exposed to the reactants are not uniform, and/or not clearly defined. In previous papers originating from this laboratory [10, II], a further method was presented to prepare 'oriented' thin film model catalysts of Pt/Al^O^. In the following, the applicability of 'oriented' and of 'non-oriented' thin film model catalysts, particularly of Pt/Al2C>3, in the study of skeletal hydrocarbon reactions will be evaluated. In the light of results obtained by transmission electron microscopy, it will be attempted to interpret particle size and shape effects in the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and in the isomerisation/hydrogenolysis of neopentane. Preparation and characterisation of catalysts Thin film model catalysts were prepared by high-vacuum evaporation of Pt on a support substrate. Supports of amorphous Al-^O^ are obtained either by electrochemical oxidation of Al foil or by chemical vapour depo- sition of Al in 0;. If epitaxial growth is desired, crystalline A1203 substrates may also be used for growth at elevated deposition temperatures, but, due to the crystalline heterogeneity of these substrates, this procedure normally leads to Pt particles of non-uniform crystal habits. Furthermore, crystalline Al^O^ exhibits a very strong background structure in the EM (Fig. 1). Gen- erally, single crystal supports such as Nad, mica and MgO have been em- ployed by most authors. By evaporating Pt epitaxially on (100) and (111) NaCI, or on other easily soluble substrates, and depositing the 'support' material (A1203, Si02 etc.) on top of the platinum, Pt crystallites with preferentially exposed (100) or (111) planes are obtained after the sub- strate is dissolved [10,11]. The Pt crystallites are surrounded by the Al^O^ 349 Fig. 1. Support of amorphous Al;03 containing a region where crystallisation to 7-A1203 has occurred. Length of marker 50 nm on each figure. covering layer, and only the crystal face previously in contact with the NaCI substrate can participate in the reaction. The number and the size distribution of as-grown metal particles on the support surface are both governed by the particular nucleation and growth processes and by secondary processes such as gas adsorption. There seems at first a wide range of catalysts of different particle size and density available for experiments, but this range is considerably reduced by the processes leading to film stability under reaction conditions. Moreover, after dissolving the NaCI substrate, a number of oxidation-reduction cycles are generally necessary to achieve or to restore catalytic activity. These heat treatments in different ambients (0;, H;, Ar) not only remove con- taminants, but also lead to morphological changes: sintering by particle migration, coalescence of low-temperature films, shape changes of individual particles (rounding of comers, formation of facets). The structural changes which may then occur have been discussed frequently, particularly by Ruckenstein and coworkers (e.g. [12,13]). Sintering, particle migration and additional artefactual changes therefore limit the range of dispersion and particle size actually obtainable with model catalysts. The initial density of Pt nuclei evaporated on a flat A^O^ surface at room temperature is of the order of 1013 cm\"2. It is reduced by treatments in O; and/or H; around 720 K, by a factor of 10 [14]. The accessible range of dispersion for 'on-top' catalysts of Pt/Al203 is therefore about 0.1 - 0.6, and the mean particle size is between 1.5 and 10 nm. Pt crystallites grown epitaxially on (100) NaCI at 573 - 673 K and covered thereafter by A\\j0y do not migrate or coalesce significantly under subsequent oxidation-reduction cycles even at 720 K, but their edges will appear rounded and the surface geometry will also be changed. (On the other hand, Pt particles evaporated on '(111)' NaCI layers on mica at 620 K are initially very densely packed. They migrate and coalesce under Oa-H; treatments [10],) The density of Pt particles on (100) NaCI deposited in 350 this temperature range depends on the roughness of the underlying NaCI surface, but is generally found in the range of 10\" -1012 cm\"2, which corresponds to a dispersion of < 0.6 and to a mean particle size between 1.5 and 10 nm [11]. This is a lower dispersion than observed on most actual supported metal catalysts, and characterisation by electron microscopy can be readily achieved. Upon application of the weak beam dark field method to epitaxially grown particles [15 -18], shapes and shape changes of crystallites 4 -10 nm in size can be determined. Furthermore, direct imaging of surface planes and atoms by high voltage EM allows, under special conditions, structural transitions to be revealed on low index faces of small crystallites [19 - 22]. In order to detect very small (1 nm range) particles on amorphous substrates, and to obtain information about their size and structure with conventional TEM, the phase contrast background of the support must be suppressed. This can either be done electronically, or best image condi- tions can be obtained by emphasizing the amplitude contrast, i'.e.by using a large aperture at relatively low acceleration voltage in slightly under- focussed condition [23]. However, the resolution of a conventional TEM will generally not suffice to distinguish between different types of clusters of this small size, e.g. to solve the crucial question of icosahedral or cubocta- hedral shape [24]. The micrographs presented in this paper were taken with a Zeiss EM 10 C transmission electron microscope equipped with STEM and EDX units. Results with 'oriented' and 'non-oriented* Pt/Al203 catalysts Shapes and shape changes Oriented Pt crystallites on [NaCI were mainly grown under optimum conditions for epitaxy, i.e. on vacuum cleaved or freshly evaporated NaCI supports at 600 30 K at an evaporation rate of 10~2 to 10~1 nm s~1. The crystals are then of a square appearance, i.e. they are half octahedra or truncated octahedra with exposed (100) base planes [16,17]. As-grown films exhibit very low catalytic activity; only after a heat treatment in oxygen above ~450 K (followed by low temperature reduction) are the activities measurable and reproducible. Heat treatments in 0; between 450 and 723 K lead to a rounding of edges and comers of particles less than 4 nm in size. The shapes of larger particles (Q) > 10 nm) are less affected by these treatments, but coalescence of larger particles may occur if they are located closely together. In Figs. 2 - 5 the effect of a combined heat treatment in oxygen (673 K, 30 min) and hydrogen (523 K, 30 min) on several catalysts is shown. The catalyst of Fig. 2 was prepared by evaporating Pt (mean film thickness 1 nm) at 623 K on NaCI and then 20 nm Al^ on top of it. It was not heated in 0^ /Ha, and consists of regular crystallites (d 4 nm). The catalysts of 351 Fig. 2. (lOO)-oriented Pt/Al2C 3, mean Pt film thickness 1 nm, d 4 nm, before treat- ment. Fig. 3.

It shows slightly rounded squares, but also some multiple twins and many less ordered particles. Figure 5 shows the effect of annealing in and H; on a catalyst consisting of densely packed epitaxial crystallites of d w 10 nm (a). In this case the Oz/H^ treatment leads to coalescence of particles, while the (100) orientation is mainly retained (b). 353 Hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane Experiments of the hydrogenolysis of MCP, undertaken a few years ago [10,25], have shown that the selectivity of the product distribution, i.e. the ratio of branched hexanes vs. n-hexane, is different on oriented and non-oriented catalysts of equal mean particle size. However, in some cases a heating of the ordered particles in oxygen increased the selectivity in direc- tion of that of the non-ordered particles. The reason for this behaviour may be different carbonaceous deposits on flat and on 'rough' crystal faces [26, 27], but also differences in the length of the Pt/Al203 boundary could ex- plain this effect in the sense of an adiineation mechanism [28]. Electron microscopy is an adequate tool to determine changes in the boundary and in the ratio of Pt surface area to boundary, occurring e.g. by heat treatments. On model catalysts evaporated 'on-top', a linear dependence between the selectivity of hydrogenolysis and the mean particle size has been pre- viously established [10,25,28]. The selectivity S = (2 MP + 3 MP)/nH plotted vs. the mean particle diameter 3 yields a straight line, which can be interpreted such that nH is mainly formed by adiineation at the phase boundary particle-support, whereas the branched hexanes are formed on the bare Pt surface. S is therefore proportional to the ratio surface/boundary and hence also to d. This simple relation holds as long as the particles are identically shaped, e.g. 'three-quarter spheres' on top of the support surface, as was assumed in references [25] and [28]. In contrast, catalysts of regular shapes partly encapsulated in the support generally show a much lower selectivity, i.e. more n-hexane production [10]. This is at least qualitatively consistent with a higher proportion of boundary to surface area. Heating the catalyst in oxygen may decrease the boundary/surface ratio and increase the selectivity. Some examples are given in Table 1. The on-top crystallites are assumed to be three-quarter spheres, and the surface/boundary ratio of the oriented TABLE l Hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane at 510 K, p^CF = 2 mbar, py = 940 mbar; selectivity of oriented and non-oriented catalysts of similar particle size, S = (2 MP + 3MP)/nH Catalyst Orientation d Surface a Boundary b a/b S Ref. no.

Isomerisation and. hydrogenolysis of neopentane The selectivity of isomerization vs. hydrogenolysis of neopentane has been investigated as a function of particle size, of temperature and of the partial pressure of hydrogen in a previous study on a number of catalysts [29]. The catalysts were mainly (100)-, partly (lll)-oriented, and partly non-oriented 'on-top' catalysts. By using TEM of unproved resolution, it can be clearly shown that the oriented catalysts are rounded by the Os/H; pretreatments but that the majority of Pt surface atoms are still in (100) planes. The '(111)' catalysts are more affected, and only weak (111) orien- tation is retained. The experimental results of [29] generally indicate a high selectivity of isomerisation, a dependence on the H; pressure, and the existence of a particle size effect. On the other hand, no obvious difference in the selec- tivity between (100)- and '(111)'-orientation was observed. The latter would be expected for the case of a triply adsorbed intermediate, as postulated long ago by Anderson and Avery [8]. However, the catalysts consisting of encapsulated crystallites, i.e. the 'oriented' samples and also those non- oriented samples which were intentionally embedded in the support, showed a lower isomerisation ability than did the 'on-top' crystallites (Table 2). The comparison with previous results [30-33] (Table 2) shows fair agreement as far as the particle size effect on the selectivity is concerned. On large particles and on continuous films the observed selectivity is very high (up to 95% isopentane). At high dispersion the results are somewhat at variance. This may be partly due to the different definition of the rates of isomerisation and hydrogenolysis (e.g. as product distribution, initial rates or bond shift rates), but mainly to the greatly varying pretreatment conditions. Where comparable, the observed activities (TOF) are in good agreement for the supported catalysts. On oriented films a somewhat higher initial activity was observed after a particular 02/H2 treatment in the present work, whereas Karpinski et al. [33] report an exceptionally high activity on (111) Pt films after an 0; 518/H2 518 treatment. It was concluded in [29] that the results point to a reaction mech- anism which acts only on one single Pt atom, e.g. to a reaction pathway via a metallocycio butane or a similar intermediate [34-36]. To understand in detail the difference between embedded an on-top crystallites, several possibilities may be considered: (i) at equal H; pressure, the hydrogen adsorption per particle is lower on embedded than on 'on-top' crystallites because of the smaller free surface area of the former; (ii) active sites for hydrogenolysis and for isomerisation are created in different proportions by annealing the oriented catalysts in oxygen and hydrogen; M M M M M M S S S S S 0 ? ^ ? & & ? os ua w w us ua sS-s^-s o a -g -a a a c e e c e c ^ w ^ A CQ w 01010i010 0 OOrHi-IC<IMCOTO e<l<?-IC<lC<l<NINOOCTCTCTWTOCTCO 1-1 ^r <fl i-< <N OS OS <r N K[ ^ tt; 10 CO ri ^ laoiow'^'t-ONONoroc-o ^ 00 00 r-l t-- o ^ ^ ca o r-< 0 tO 0 ^l 00000000000000 c<io c<ipie<i<Ni-iT-ic<ie<it-ir-iT-ii-i cococowcoco cowooco C-t^t^t^C^C^ ^t^^-ICO mioio>n>nio miointo <SO*C<C4(SC< r4<s^*^1 asaffiaffi aaaa woowcorocoooroooCTco'TO'oooo ^ ^ C^t^C^C^O^Nt^r^t^C^r-^1 1 CDCD<DtDCDCO^P0^^3l0^c--u5lO oooooo a'aoo-s 30*0 co r~ TJI Tjl t~ tO <0 (00 (0000 do ddr-idi-id oq T-i 1-1 oo oq co i-i >n N w ^ T-I o <N 0< s rt (n ^~- _ mO 0 m 'So-?-?o , S ^ < < ^ S'S' ^ <; >;>; < 0> CT> 10 10 .S> ^^^ ^osot oS'^'-i'-\"^'-''-' c c ^SSS'^o.o.llS.o^^ oo'1: g s^^< s^^^^ &:!rtSaaS^^^- <<l!^~<-^^ ^)t3 aiom a^Ss-s-s-^s-ls'y MMiMdd^ft-ft<P<fr<CLiP-.P-fr, 356 (iii) carbonaceous deposits are formed on flat parts of the crystal surfaces; (iv) adiineation effects. Possibility (i) will lead to a different intermediate only if significant charge transfer occurs from adsorbed H to Pt. It is generally not supported by experiments or theory. Electron microscopy may, however, help to dis- tinguish between possibilities (ii) and (iii), and also evaluate again possible contributions from adiineation effects (the latter being improbable because isomerisation of neopentane is rather support-insensitive). In the following, the idea of 'formation of an active configuration' is favoured, which results from shape changes upon heating in 0^ and H^ (Figs. 3 - 5) and this will be discussed further below. Discussion comparison to single crystal results Structural effects in skeletal hydrocarbon reactions have frequently been explained by the different activity and selectivity of different crystal planes, or of special geometries of the sites prevailing at the surface. For example, isomerisation by bond shift of neopentane has been formerly attributed to (111) facets by Anderson and Avery [8], by Boudart and coworkers [30] and others. Orientation effects on neopentane reactions over palladium films have also been reported by Karpinski [37]. Since then, many bond shift reactions have been investigated on single crystal Pt surfaces ((111), (100), stepped and kinked) [6,7]. They generally show that the activity is higher on stepped surfaces than on the densely packed planes. The isomerisation activity of branched hexanes, e.g., is increased on stepped surfaces vicinal to (111), compared to vicinals of the (100) surface, to the (111) surface and to poly crystalline surfaces. Garin and coworkers attributed this to step coalescence induced by H2 adsorption [7]. On the other hand, Davis and Somorjai [6] observed a high selectivity of isomerisation of isobutane and neopentane on Pt(lOO) and on its vicinal (13,1, 1). In either of these single crystal results, the possibility is excluded that only three-atom arrays forming 83 sites or (111) facets are necessary for isomerisation activ- ity. In a recent paper [38], the Strasbourg group describes isomerisation and hydrocracking reactions of 2-methylpentane and of n-hexane on Pt(311) in a uhv-compatible high pressure cell. These results, compared with the previous ones on Pt(lll), Pt(557), Pt(119), Pt/A^Oa and on polycrystalline Pt(7), show that every Pt surface has its own specific activity and selectiv- ity. For example, a '(111)' arrangement in connection with a (100) terrace favours hydrocracking. The authors conclude further that on smaller crystal- lites 85 sites may be regarded as the seat of bond shift and/or hydrocracking. Further experiments by the Berkeley group on MCP hydrogenolysis [39] show that selective ring opening is favoured on the Pt(lOO) surface. On the other hand, a comparison of a number of skeletal reactions, including the conversion of MCP on disperse Pt black, with single crystal 357 results from the Berkeley group has shown good agreement as far as the activity and the response to hydrogen are concerned [40], with Pt black behaving similarly to surfaces with (111) symmetry. The strong hydrogen dependence of most skeletal reactions of alkanes, and the fact that hydrogen effects are frequently superimposed on particle size effects, has led Bragin et al. [41], and since then several other authors, to conclude that the particle size, or generally the surface topography, acts by governing the hydrogen concentration at the metal surface. On the other hand, self-poisoning by carbonaceous layers which is less pronounced on small particles and on stepped surfaces has been claimed responsible for experimentally ob- served size effects [27]. It is known that Pt surfaces are more affected by self-poisoning than Ni, Ir and other metals [27, 42] and, therefore, hydrogen may exert a regulating effect by influencing the nature and the extent of these deposits. Apart from the hydrogen dependence of the actual reaction, the pretreatment of the catalyst in H^ as well as in 0; also plays an important role for activity and selectivity. An oxygen treatment between 450 and 720 K, followed by low-temperature reduction, leads to an increase in activity (cf. also [33]), whereas after a high-temperature reduction the activity is generally lowered and the selectivity may also be changed [43]. In the present study the effect of hydrogen pretreatment at different temperatures was not investigated, but the effect of oxygen treatment on the catalytic activity was very pronounced in the MCP reaction as well as in the neopen- tane reaction. Here, electron microscopic evidence can be used to show that the effect of oxygen is not only to remove carbon(aceous deposits), but also to alter the surface geometry near the boundary surface/support, and even the epitaxial surface of smaller crystallites is affected. In the present study a maximum in the overall activity was generally observed after the 'standard' pretreatment (673 Oz, 523 or 573 H;). Some of the (111) grown films had a relatively high activity even after the first 0; treatment below 500 K. This behaviour may be related to their highly defective structure, quoted also by Karpinski et al. [33] to explain unusually high activities after an 0-^ 518/Hz 518 treatment. On 'on-top' grown catalysts and on (100) epitaxial films, the Oa/H; treatment provides an active configuration of surface sites which probably consists of (100) terraces, but also includes steps and defects. It is well-known that facetting of irregular particles may occur under heating at more severe conditions [44]. Recent experiments by Wang et al. [45] indicate that, rather independently of the original particle shape, heating in H;, at 873 K and above, produces predominantly (100) faces of Pt on A1203 and SiO; support. A clue to the special catalytic properties of Pt(lOO) and of (100)- containing terraces may be the well-known property of the clean surface to reconstruct from a bulk-like structure into a hexagonal array. The re- constructions of Pt(lOO) and -(110) have led to the conclusion that reactive transformations of the surface structure may also occur during a catalytic 358 reaction, sometimes periodically [46-48]. Although these processes are probably very complex in dispersed systems at high pressures, it is evident that under the influence of most gases at higher pressures and temperatures, in particular H2 and CO, Pt has the tendency to form (100) facets. Conclusions Although electron microscopy would allow, in principle, distinction between different surface arrangements, and even between different surface sites of a real catalyst, the practical achievement of this aim is still far from reality. However, as already pointed out, single crystal results as well as results in dispersed systems indicate that microfacetting, either during the reaction or due to the pretreatment, leads to the creation of surfaces sites which may be associated with a phase transition on an atomic scale [48, 49]. For the reaction of neopentane with hydrogen, there is certain electron microscopic evidence that (lOO)-containing configurations play a role in determining the ratio hydrocracking/isomerisation, whereas for the hydro- genolysis of methylcyclopentane the results favour an adiineation mechanism. Finally, it should be considered that hydrogen is always present at the surface and may constantly change its properties. Thus the selection of the correct mechanism of a hydrocarbon reaction will continue to be a difficult task for quite a long period of time.

Hayek Institut für Physikalische Chemie, Universität Innsbruck, 6020 InnsbruckAustria Thin film model catalysts are very useful in heterogeneous catalysis because they are easily characterised by electron microscopy. On the other hand, single crystal studies under clean conditions have contributed significantly to the understanding of structural effects in hydrocarbon reactions. For some reaction systems the experimental agreement between single crystals and dispersed catalysts is good, but for most of the demanding reactions a rather poor correlation is observed. This problem was tackled by preparing ‘oriented’ thin film catalysts (Pt/Al2O3) as an intermediate approach between single crystals and thin island films. The films consist of nearly perfect micro single crystals surrounded by the carrier film and exposing only one plane to the ambient. The treatment in oxygen and hydrogen necessary to induce catalytic activity leads generally to a facetting of the surface, introducing steps and other specific surface sites. On the basis of electron microscopic data, it is discussed how these treatments can influence the structure of oriented and of non-oriented films. Experimental kinetic data concerning both the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and the isomerisation of neopentane on Pt/Al2O3 are reviewed, and a connection between the surface structure and the selectivity is tentatively established.
