Effective lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation at low temperatures has long been a challenge in catalytic oxidation reactions. Traditional thermal catalytic soot combustion, even with Pt/Pd catalysts, is inefficient at exhaust temperatures below 200 °C, particularly under conditions of frequent idling. Herein, we report an effective strategy utilizing non-thermal plasma (NTP) to activate Olatt in Ce1–x Co x O2–δ catalysts, achieving dramatic enhancement of the soot combustion rate at low temperatures. At 200 °C and 4.3 W (discharge power, P dis), NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ achieved 96.9% soot conversion (X C), 99.0% CO2 selectivity (S(CO2)) and a maximum energy conversion efficiency (E max) of 14.7 g kWh–1. Compared with previously reported results, NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ exhibits the highest S(CO2) and E max values. Remarkably, even without heating, X C, E max, and S(CO2) reached 92.1%, 6.1 g kWh–1, and 97.5%, respectively, at 6.3 W (P dis). The results of characterization and theoretical calculation demonstrated that Co dopes into the CeO2 crystal lattice and forms an asymmetric Ce–O–Co structure, making oxygen “easy come, easy go”, thereby enabling the rapid combustion of soot over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . This study highlights the great potential of NTP for activating Olatt and provides valuable insights into the design of efficient NTP-adapted catalysts for oxidation reactions. Graphical Abstract Non-thermal plasma efficiently activates lattice oxygen at asymmetric Ce–O–Co sites in the Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ catalyst, enabling rapid soot combustion at low temperatures, with a maximum energy efficiency of 14.7 g kWh–1— 49-fold higher than plasma alone (0.3 g kWh–1). Keywords Reactive oxygen species Lattice oxygen Asymmetric Ce-O-Co structure Non-thermal plasma Soot combustion 1 Introduction The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) is crucial in heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions, with adsorbed oxygen (O2 –, O2 2–, and O–) and Olatt (O2–) serving as two predominant ROSs in numerous catalytic oxidation processes [1–3]. At low temperatures, the activation of Olatt in metal oxides remains a significant challenge because of its inherently high activation energy barrier and sluggish oxygen migration kinetics [4,5]. Soot emitted from diesel exhaust is the primary contributor to haze formation and elevated PM2.5 levels. Catalytic diesel particulate filters (CDPF) are considered the most economical and feasible post-treatment technique for controlling soot elimination [6,7]. During cold starts of diesel engines, exhaust temperatures remain low (100–200 °C), resulting in a substantial increase in pollutant emissions. However, currently available catalysts cannot reduce the ignition temperature below the exhaust temperature [8–10], because few catalysts can continuously provide sufficient amounts of ROSs at such low temperatures. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an effective low-temperature soot oxidation catalytic technology with a low energy demand and cost. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) can enable the activation of surface-catalyzed reactions via high-energy electrons (1–10 eV) under mild conditions, overcoming the limitations of traditional thermal catalysis [11–13]. Furthermore, it has the advantage of being able to generate various active oxygen species (e.g., O atoms, O3, O–, O2 –, and OH radicals) [14–16]. Consequently, NTP may serve as a viable strategy to activate metal-oxygen bonds, thereby enhancing the reactivity of Olatt in redox reactions [17,18]. Although NTP-catalyzed systems demonstrate advantages in the low-temperature combustion of soot, few conventional thermal catalysts have achieved effective synergy with NTP [19–21]. Therefore, it is necessary to design efficient catalysts that can be used with NTP and clarify their synergistic mechanisms. Previous studies have focused on the activation of oxygen adsorbed on the catalyst surface by NTP, while neglecting the Olatt on the catalyst surface. We believe that simultaneous activation of adsorbed oxygen and Olatt on the catalyst surface by NTP may provide more ROSs for soot oxidation. In general, a lower binding strength of Olatt to oxide lattices can promote Olatt release to form oxygen vacancies (VO) [22,23]. Consequently, tuning the Olatt reactivity and local environment of VO is essential for improving the synergetic catalytic performance of NTP catalysts [24–26]. CeO2 has a unique oxygen storage/release capacity enabled by the facile Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycle, making it a suitable candidate for accelerating electron migration and activating oxygen species [27–30]. However, CeO2 exhibits inherent limitations, including poor thermal stability, weak poisoning resistance, and inferior long-term cycling stability. It is well known that the catalytic activity and thermal stability of oxides can be improved by proper heteroatomic doping, which will adjust the Olatt coordination environment and its electronic structure. Moreover, cobalt (Co) is frequently employed as a transition metal dopant to modulate metal-oxygen bond strength, increase the surface ROS concentration, and enhance Olatt mobility in soot combustion catalysts [31,32]. Therefore, we selected CeO2 as the catalyst host and Co as the dopant. In this work, we fabricated Co-doped CeO2 catalysts (Ce1–x Co x O2–δ ) and integrated the catalysts into NTP for catalytic soot combustion. Systematic characterization combined with theoretical simulations revealed that the apparent activity energy of Olatt in Ce–O–Co is much lower than that in Ce–O–Ce. Advanced NTP isotopic oxygen exchange tests confirmed that Olatt of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ catalyst can be activated by NTP, significantly increasing the combustion rate of soot. The Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ catalyst exhibited high activity at 200 °C and 4.3 W (P dis). Soot conversion was 96.9%, with E max and CO2 selectivity (S(CO2)) reaching 14.7 g kWh–1 and 99.0%, respectively. We compared the E max and S(CO2) values with previously reported results and demonstrated the potential of the Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ catalyst for achieving the highest energy efficiency and minimal CO emissions. This work confirms the dominant role of Olatt in catalytic soot combustion over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ at low temperatures and provides valuable insights into the design of efficient NTP-adapted catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Ce1–x Co x O2–δ series catalysts were synthesized via the citric acid sol-gel method. In a typical procedure, Ce (NO3)3·6H2O and Co (NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water with designated Ce/Co molar ratios (9:1, 4:1, 7:3, 3:2, or 1:1). The mixture was then magnetically stirred at room temperature for five min to obtain a homogeneous solution. After clarification, citric acid was added under vigorous stirring at a citric acid to (Ce + Co) ratio of 1.2:1. Subsequently, the solution was first maintained at 60 °C for 1 h to allow pre-reaction, then heated to 90 °C with continuous stirring to evaporate water and form a gel. The resultant gel was dried at 200 °C for 1 h to yield a porous precursor, which was ground and calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h under air atmosphere, ultimately producing Ce1–x Co x O2–δ composite oxides with varying cobalt doping levels (x = 0.1–0.5). Pure CeO2 and Co3O4 were prepared using identical procedures for comparison. Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -HCl, Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -R, and Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -S were also prepared for comparison. More details are provided in Section S1 of the Supporting Information. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The actual Ce/Co ratios of the samples were calculated based on the Ce and Co contents measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Agilent Technologies 730). The crystal structure of the samples was identified via a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, SmartLab, Rigaku) employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and operating at 45 kV and 100 mA, in which the 2θ range was 20°–80° with a step size of 0.02° and a scanning rate of 10° min–1. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the samples was evaluated by N2 adsorption-desorption at –196 °C with a physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 analyzer). Before the measurement, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h. High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (Thermo Scientific Talos F200X G2). Raman spectra of the samples were obtained using a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer at room temperature with a detection laser at 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument to determine the oxidation states of the catalyst surface species. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker A300 instrument. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) experiments were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemical adsorption instrument (USA). In H2-TPR experiments, a 50 mg sample was placed into a U-type adsorption quartz tube and pretreated at 300 °C for 30 min under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling to 60 °C, the atmosphere was switched to 10% H2/Ar, and the temperature was increased from 60 to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 under a gas flow of 30 mL min–1. The H2 uptake was recorded using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For O2-TPD analysis, a 100 mg sample was placed in a U-type reactor and pretreated at 300 °C for 30 min under an O2 atmosphere. After cooling to 60 °C, O2 was introduced at a flow of 30 mL min–1 for ten min. Then, the physisorbed O2 was removed by He (30 mL min–1) for 1 h. Finally, the temperature was increased from 60 °C to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 under He flow (30 mL min–1). NTP isothermal oxygen isotope tracing experiments were conducted using a mass spectrometer (Hiden Analytical HPR-20), including exchange measurements of lattice oxygen with isotope oxygen and oxidation reaction experiments of soot with isotope oxygen. In the exchange measurements of lattice oxygen with isotope oxygen, 50 mg of catalyst loaded in the reactor were treated for 30 min in 50 mL min–1 Ar at 400 °C to remove the adsorbed oxygen species (physically and chemically adsorbed oxygen) on the surface. When the temperature dropped to 200 °C in Ar, the gas flow was set to 5% 18O2/Ar and discharging began (input power P in = 13 W, approximately 20 min). The MS signals at m/z = 32 (16O2), 34 (16O18O), and 36 (18O2) were monitored by mass spectrometer during discharge. In the oxidation reaction experiments of soot with isotope oxygen, a 50 mg sample (catalyst/soot = 40:1, loose contact) packed in the plasma reactor was purged with 50 mL min–1 pure Ar at 200 °C for approximately 25 min. When the concentration of CO x became constant, all the oxygen species that could participate in the oxidation of soot in the catalyst were consumed in the absence of gaseous O2 (Fig. S1). The reaction was then directly switched to 5% 18O2/Ar (Central China Special Gas Co., Ltd.) at a flow rate of 50 mL min–1 and the P in was maintained at 13 W for ten min. The MS signals at m/z = 28 (C16O), 30 (C18O), 32 (16O2), 34 (16O18O), 36 (18O2), 44 (C16O2), 46 (C16O18O), and 48 (C18O2) were monitored by mass spectrometer during discharge. 2.3 Evaluation of catalytic performance The catalytic performance of the NTP-catalysts in soot combustion was tested in a plasma-catalytic system (Fig. S2) consisting of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, high-voltage power supply, gas supply system, and gas analysis system. A mixture of 100 mg catalyst and 2.5 mg soot, prepared in loose contact mode, was loaded into a quartz fixed-bed microreactor with an inner diameter of 10 mm. The reaction gas mixture consisted of N₂ (balance gas) and optional components, including 0–0.2% NO, 0–10% H2O, and 10% O2. The total gas flow rate was maintained at 50 mL min–1 using mass flow controllers. The reactor wall temperature was controlled at non-heated (room temperature, RT), 60 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, or 200 °C, depending on experimental requirements. During discharge (“plasma on” stage), a high-voltage alternating current (AC) power supply was applied to the electrodes with a P in of 13–20 W for 30 min, while voltage and current waveforms were monitored in real-time using a Rigol DS1052E oscilloscope. After plasma discharge, the reactor temperature was raised from the initial test temperature to 550 or 650 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 to ensure complete oxidation of the soot (“plasma off” stage). The outlet gas from the reactor was diluted with N2 to a total flow rate of 200 mL min–1 via a mixing chamber before online analysis of CO and CO2 concentrations using a Thermo Fisher Nicolet IS50 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). The dilution step ensured that the CO2 concentration remained within the linear detection range of the FTIR spectrum. For more detailed reactor configurations and evaluation procedures, please refer to Section S2 of Supporting Information and our previous report [14]. 2.4 Stability test During the first cycle (Cycle 1), the catalyst was mixed with soot (40:1 w/w ratio) using a medicine spoon to obtain loose contact, and the mixture was loaded into the discharge region. A flow of 10% O2 in N2 was fed into the reactor at a rate of 50 mL min –1. The temperature of the reactor was controlled at 200 °C before plasma discharge, and then high voltage was applied to the high-voltage electrode by an AC power supply (CTP-2000 K, Nanjing Suman Electronics Co., Ltd., China) with a frequency of 26.88 kHz, and P in of 13 W. The discharge process lasted 30 min. After the plasma discharge was stopped, the temperature of the reactor was raised from 200 to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min –1 for the complete consumption of soot. After Cycle 1, the soot was completely consumed. The clean sample and soot were mixed again with a medicine spoon (in the same ratio), and the catalytic process described in Cycle 1 was repeated (Cycle 2). 2.5 Computational method Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the effect of Co-doping on the surface oxygen cycling ability of CeO2 (111). All the DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). Details of the DFT calculation data can be found in Section S3 of Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts A series of Ce1–x Co x O2–δ catalysts were successfully synthesized via a sol-gel method and subsequently calcined at 550 °C for crystal reconstruction. ICP-OES analysis results revealed that the actual molar ratios of Ce to Co in Ce1–x Co x O2–δ catalysts are almost the same as the feed ratios (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 1(a) , Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0–0.5) catalysts exhibit well-resolved diffraction peaks located at 2θ values of approximately 28.6 (111), 33.1 (200), 47.5 (220), 56.3 (311), 59.1 (222), 69.4 (400), and 76.7° (331), assigning to the face-centered cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 crystals [33]. Importantly, no characteristic peaks of Co3O4 (JCPDS 43-1003) are observed when the molar fraction of Co in the total cations is below 20% (x < 0.2), which can be attributed to highly dispersed Co3O4 on the surface of CeO2 or Co incorporated into the CeO2 lattice [34]. Moreover, the magnified XRD patterns for Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.5) are slightly shifted toward a higher Bragg angle compared with pure CeO2 (Fig. 1(b)), and its corresponding lattice parameter (0.5421 nm), calculated from the (111) peak, also changes (Table S2). This implies that Co is partially incorporated into the CeO2 lattice to cause lattice contraction because the radii of Co2+ ions (0.075 nm) or Co3+ ions (0.065 nm) are smaller than that of Ce4+ ions (0.097 nm) [35,36]. Meanwhile, the metal-oxygen (M–O) bond arrangement and lattice defects of Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4) were also studied by Raman spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. 1(c). For CeO2, only an intense symmetric F 2g peak at 462.1 cm–1 is observed, assigned to symmetrical stretching of the Ce–O bond. Co3O4 exhibits four Raman peaks at 477.0, 516.9, 615.1, and 685.6 cm–1, corresponding to the E g, F 2 2g, F 3 2g, and A 1g modes, respectively [37]. Notably, the F 2g peak of Ce0.9Co0.1O2–δ is shifted to ~457.9 cm–1, exhibiting asymmetric broadening and significant intensity attenuation relative to CeO2. The changes in the symmetry and intensity of the vibrational modes further demonstrate the incorporation of Co into the CeO2 lattice [38,39]. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and diffuse rings in the selected area electron diffraction patterns of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ (Fig. 1(d)) show only lattice fringes of CeO2 (0.31 nm (111) and 0.27 nm (200)), while the lattice fringe of Co3O4 (0.24 nm, 311) is only observed in Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ (Fig. 1(e)). No phases for separated CoO X particles can be observed by HRTEM, further revealing the formation of a homogeneous solid solution in Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . EDX element mapping of the Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ and Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ catalysts (Fig. S3) demonstrates the homogeneous dispersion of Ce, Co, and O. The XRD, Raman, and HRTEM results show that Co can be doped into the crystal lattice of CeO2 to form a solid solution with a solubility limit of Co in CeO2 of less than 20%, while excess Co forms Co3O4 particles uniformly dispersed on the surface or inside of the sample. The effects of the type of oxygen species and oxygen desorption behavior in Co-doped CeO2 catalysts were investigated by XPS, H2-TPR, and O2-TPD. As shown in Fig. S4, the O 1s spectra of Ce1–x Co x O2–δ catalysts can be split into two components. The peak located at approximately 531.3 eV can be assigned to surface chemisorbed oxygen (Oads), and that at approximately 529.1 eV is attributed to surface lattice oxygen (Olatt). Compared with CeO2, a shift of the Olatt peak towards the low energy side can be found in Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4), demonstrating that the chemical environment of lattice oxygen is greatly affected by the doping of Co species [36]. The lower binding energy of Olatt is manifested as unstable facial oxygen [40]. The H2-TPR results in Fig. S5 show consistent conclusions. Compared with pure CeO2 (509 °C) and Co3O4 (302 °C), the α peak shifts to a lower temperature region (240–282 °C) after Co doping, indicating that the synergistic effect between Ce and Co promotes the reducibility and oxygen mobility of Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4) catalysts [41]. The profiles of O2-TPD (Fig. 1(f)) can be divided into three regions; Regions I (100–250 °C), II (250–450 °C), and III (> 650 °C) are assigned to weakly chemisorbed and physisorbed oxygen, subsurface lattice oxygen, and bulk lattice oxygen, respectively [38,42]. In contrast to CeO2, the amount of OII released in Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4) substantially increases, and the corresponding desorption temperature decreases from 375 to 334 °C, demonstrating that Co-doped CeO2 can boost the release of Olatt [43]. Moreover, the amounts of desorbed bulk lattice oxygen in region III of Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4) catalysts are much larger than those from bare CeO2, with a much lower desorption temperature than that for pure Co3O4. We can infer that the mobility of bulk lattice oxygen in these solid-solution catalysts is greatly enhanced. 3.2 Catalytic performance The X C within 30 min, S(CO2), and E max were used to estimate the synergetic catalytic performance of NTP-catalysts for soot combustion in 10% O2/N2 at 200 °C. Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S6 show the variation of CO x concentration (C(CO2) and C(CO)) during NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ for soot combustion with discharge time. Impressively, the C(CO2) of Ce0.8Co0.2O2-δ increases sharply to 0.99% within 1 min discharge, and the corresponding X C is 28.6% (Figs. 2(a), (b)). For thermal catalytic soot combustion, the temperatures for 10%, 50%, and 90% soot conversion are 275 (T 10), 341 (T 50), and 434 °C (T 90), respectively (Fig. S7). Notably, the maximum CO2 concentration is only 0.06%, which is much lower than that of the NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ hybrid. Obviously, the synergistic catalytic effect between NTP and catalyst greatly increases the rate of generation of ROSs, which promotes soot combustion at 200 °C. The order of X C within 30 min after discharging ranks as follows (Fig. 2(c) and Table S3): Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ (96.9%) > Ce0.7Co0.3O2–δ (90.1%) > Ce0.9Co0.1O2–δ (78.2%) > Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ (64.3%) > Ce0.5Co0.5O2–δ (38.3%) ≈ CeO2 (39.7%) > Co3O4 (18.1%) ≈ Blank (17.9%, SiO2). Only when x is within the range of 0.1 to 0.4 do the samples display a synergistic catalytic effect with NTP. In this range, Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ shows the best synergistic catalytic performance. Generally, a large specific surface area exposes more active sites, resulting in excellent catalytic activity. As shown in Table S2, the BET surface area of CeO2 is 29.8 m2 g–1. When the molar fraction of Co in the total cations exceeds 10% (x > 0.1), the specific surface area of the Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.2–0.5) catalysts decreases and is similar at different cobalt ratios (21.5–25.8 m2 g–1). Consequently, the variations in catalytic performance are primarily attributed to the structure and number of active sites rather than to changes in the specific surface area. Furthermore, NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ exhibits good stability through five reaction cycles (Fig. 2(d)). In addition to X C and S(CO2), E max is an important indicator of plasma-catalyst synergy in catalytic technology, and was calculated based on Eq. (S4). Fig. 2(e) and Table S4 show that the E max of NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ reached 14.7 g kWh–1 at 200 °C, which is 49 times higher than with plasma alone (SiO2, 0.3 g kWh–1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an energy efficiency of NTP-catalyst synergistic catalysis to eliminate soot exceeding 14 g kWh–1 when the temperature is lower than 200 °C (Table S5). Diesel engine exhaust gases inevitably contain water vapor and nitrogen oxides (NO x ), which affect soot oxidation [20,44]. To satisfy the requirements of practical applications, the catalytic performance of NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ was evaluated in the presence of water vapor (10%) and various NO x concentrations (0–0.2%). Interestingly, simultaneous increases in X C and S(CO2) were observed (Fig. 2(f)) when 10% H2O vapor was added to the simulated exhaust gas, which can be attributed to the generation of OH radicals from the reaction of O atoms with H2O molecules during the discharge process [45]. It has been reported that the reaction rate of OH radicals with carbon is 1.5 times as fast as that with O atoms [46]. To eliminate the influence of NO x produced by discharging in a 10% O2/N2 atmosphere, N2 was replaced with Ar. As shown in Fig. 2(g) and Table S6, the X C and S(CO2) decreased by 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Surprisingly, an increase in NO concentration (0–0.2%) resulted in an insubstantial improvement in activity (84.4%–89.1%) at 13 W (P in) and 150 °C, indicating that NO x has a slightly positive effect on soot combustion over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . The effect of P dis (Table S7) and temperature on soot combustion were also studied over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . As depicted in Fig. 2(h) and Table S6, with an increase of P dis from 5.1 to 7.7 W (without heating and 10% O2/N2), the X C increased from 75.7% to 95.8%, while S(CO2) was relatively constant (approximately 98%). The number density of energetic electrons increases with P dis, which can simultaneously increase the activation and replenishment rates of lattice oxygen [47]. Remarkably, even without heating, the E max of NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ was as high as 6.1 g kWh–1 at 6.3 W (Table S4). With an increase in the furnace wall temperature from 60 to 200 °C (P in = 13 W and 10% O2/N2), X C (51.2%–96.9%) and E max (4.4–14.7 g kWh–1) exhibited an upward trend with S(CO2) > 98% (Fig. 2(h), Tables S4 and S6). The synergistic catalysis of NTP and catalyst for the activation of oxygen adsorbed on the VO is boosted by increasing the temperature, thereby expediting the replenishment rate of lattice oxygen to improve soot combustion [14,19]. 3.3 Identifying active sites and ROSs The above characterization suggests that highly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles or Ce–Co–O solid solutions may be critical for synergistic catalysis. To clearly distinguish the contribution of the Ce–Co–O solid solution and surface Co3O4 in the synergistic catalytic process, the performance of NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -HCl and NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ was compared (where Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -HCl is Ce1–x Co x O2–δ treated with hydrochloric acid), and the results are shown in Figs. S8 and 2(c). The ICP (Table S1) and XRD (Fig. 2(i)) results confirm that the surface-segregated Co3O4 on the catalyst was removed by hydrochloric acid with less influence on the bulk phase structure, and this was also confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy results (Fig. S9). Surprisingly, the performance of Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ -HCl was significantly improved compared with that of pristine Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ , which was similar to that of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . In contrast, the performance of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -HCl was almost the same before and after acid treatment. Therefore, it appears that the Ce–Co–O solid solution phase is critical in the synergistic catalytic process, and the low performance of Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ may be caused by partial coverage of the Co3O4 granular layer on the surface-active sites of the solid solution phase. Furthermore, Fig. S10 and Table S7 show that the shape of the Lissajous curve with Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ -HCl in the discharge zone is substantially different from that with Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ in the discharge zone at the same temperature and P in, and the P dis calculated from Lissajous curve increases from 3.8 to 4.1 W. The Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ have an adverse impact on the transmission of electric energy into plasma, thus reducing the performance of NTP-Ce0.6Co0.4O2–δ in soot oxidation. Accordingly, the substitution level of Co in CeO2 is the core factor in establishing a synergistic effect; it alters the coordination environment of Olatt and/or the amount of Oads on the catalyst surface. Nevertheless, according to the results of O2-TPD, the capacity of Oads on Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.4) is similar and slightly higher than that of CeO2, which is inconsistent with the performance of NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ . Therefore, we speculate that the incorporation of Co increases the freedom of lattice oxygen, thereby effectively attenuating the energy threshold for the catalyst to utilize the energetic electrons generated by the NTP. To further explore the roles of oxygen species (Olatt and Oads) in soot oxidation, 16O/18O isotopic experiments were employed over NTP-Ce1–x Co x O2–δ . The catalysts were pretreated in Ar flow for 30 min at 400 °C before isothermal plasma isotope 18O exchange reactions. Therefore, the 16O of gas-phase molecular oxygen is considered to originate only from the lattice oxygen atoms of the oxides. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , for CeO2, the fraction of 16O18O rises sharply first and then decreases slowly. Correspondingly, the fraction of 18O2 changes inversely. Generally, under the individual stimulation of heat, the temperature of oxygen exchange between CeO2 and gas-phase oxygen is higher than 400 °C [48,49]. Obviously, NTP can promote oxygen exchange between gas-phase molecular oxygen (18O2) and Olatt (16O) of CeO2 at 200 °C. Co3O4 exhibited a similar trend to that of CeO2 in terms of oxygen exchange behavior, but the exchange rate between 18O2 and 16O in Co3O4 is much lower than that in CeO2. In the case of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , the 18O2 and 16O18O evolution in the initial 30 s is almost identical to that in CeO2. In contrast, for Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , there is an additional slowly increasing amount of 16O18O in the range of 30–120 s, indicating that substitution of Ce by Co favors the release and mobility of lattice oxygen [50]. Figs. 3(b), (c) and S1 show the profiles of the isotope-labeled soot oxidation reaction experiments over NTP-CeO2, NTP-Co3O4, and NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ in 5% 18O2/Ar atmosphere. For CeO2, the content of gas-phase oxygen molecules (18O2) decreases rapidly at the beginning of plasma discharge and stabilizes at 40 s (Fig. 3(b)). Simultaneously, the contents of CO2 and CO slowly increase, C18O2 and C18O are generated first, and their concentrations are higher than those of C16O2 and C16O18O (Fig. 3(c)). This suggests that the ROSs are mainly generated by NTP-activated gas-phase oxygen molecules. However, the formation of 16O18O occurs much later than that of CO2, which can be attributed to the reaction between Olatt and soot. Consistent with the oxygen exchange results, the content of 18O2 in the NTP-Co3O4 catalytic soot combustion process decreases only slightly at the beginning of the plasma discharge (Fig. 3(b)). The concentrations of CO2 and CO initially increase slowly, and then remain constant after 40 s. The variation patterns of C18O2, C16O18O, C16O2, C18O, and C16O align with those observed for CeO2; however, their reaction rates are significantly lower. For Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , the consumption of 18O2 is more than twice that of CeO2; correspondingly, the contents of CO2 and CO increase rapidly. Different from the results for CeO2, C16O2, C16O18O, and C18O2 are generated simultaneously in the case of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , and the rate of increase of C16O2 and C16O18O is significantly faster than that of C18O2, revealing that ROSs mainly originate from the Olatt of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . Accordingly, it is speculated that the ROSs mainly result from NTP-activated Olatt of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , while the NTP-activated oxygen molecules regenerate the consumed lattice oxygen. Furthermore, although the content of 18O2 reaches a plateau at 90 s, the contents of C16O2 and C16O18O continue to increase rapidly between 90 and 180 s, indicating that the consumption and migration rate of Olatt are significantly faster than those of lattice oxygen. 3.4 Synergistic catalytic reaction mechanism for soot oxidation Based on the above results, soot combustion catalyzed by NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2-δ can be decoupled into two steps: the oxidation of soot by lattice oxygen and the replenishment of consumed lattice oxygen. To verify this theory, we carried out anaerobic soot combustion over NTP-catalyst (CeO2-R and Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -R) and NTP-regenerated samples (Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -S and CeO2-S) in 10% O2/N2 flow and characterized the products by XRD, Raman, XPS, and EPR. The results are shown in Figs. 3(d)–(f), S11, and S12. The diffraction peak intensity of CeO2-R and Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -R are significantly lower than those of CeO2 and Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ (Figs. 3(d), (e)), which can be attributed to the formation of VO, which reduces the periodic atomic arrangements of crystalline samples. Moreover, the consumption of lattice oxygen in plasma-catalyzed soot combustion tests without gas-phase oxygen input can induce the reduction of metal cations in the catalysts [10,43,51]. Compared with CeO2 and Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ , there is an increase in the proportion of Ce3+ in CeO2-R and Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -R (Figs. 3(f) and S11), implying that Olatt can be activated by collision with energetic electrons from NTP at 200 °C. Notably, after NTP treatment for ten min in 10% O2/N2, the diffraction peaks of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -S exhibit growth in intensity, confirming that NTP promotes reoxidation of VO of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ at 200 °C. In contrast, no obvious differences are seen in the peak intensity between CeO2-S and CeO2-R (Figs. 3(d), (e)), suggesting that the lattice oxygen of CeO2 is more difficult to replenish with NTP at 200 °C. As shown in Fig. S12, the peak intensities of VO (g = 2.003) and Ce3+ (g ⊥ = 1.963 and g ∥ = 1.937) for the Ce1–x Co x O2–δ -R catalyst are significantly higher than those for pristine Ce1–x Co x O2–δ , further confirming that Olatt participates in soot oxidation. After adding supplementary O2, the peak intensities of OV and Ce3+ in the Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ -S catalyst recover to the level seen in Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . In contrast, the peak intensities of CeO2-S remain much stronger than those of CeO2. This indicates that the consumed Olatt in Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ is more easily replenished, consistent with the above XRD, Raman, and XPS characterization results. Compared with the Olatt of CeO2, that in Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ is not only easily activated by NTP, but also the VO of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ are easily replenished by NTP. Accordingly, the local charge imbalance in the asymmetric oxygen active site (Ce–O–Co) is beneficial for the catalytic cycle of lattice oxygen [52]. The effects of asymmetric oxygen active sites (Ce–O–Co) on the activation and regeneration of lattice oxygen are discussed through DFT calculations. The structural configurations of CeO2 and Co-CeO2 are shown in Figs. 4(a) , (b). The structural configurations of CeO2 and Co-CeO2 and formation energy of Co-CeO2 are shown in Figs. 4(a), (b) and S13. The lattice substitution of Co for Ce is intensely exothermic (–1.06 eV), demonstrating that the formation of Co-CeO2 is thermodynamically favorable. For the surface metal elements, the coordination number of the Ce site is six (Ce–O6), but that of the Co heteroatom is only three (Co–O3). Therefore, changes in the coordination field cause the distance between two adjacent oxygen atoms to shrink from 3.824 Å in CeO2 to 3.083 Å in Co-CeO2. In addition, the significant ionic radius difference between Ce and Co creates a typical compressive strain along the Ce–O chains, which increases the distance between the two original O ligands of the Ce atoms. On this basis, the oxygen cycling ability was investigated on both surfaces, involving two segments of lattice oxygen release and supplementation (Figs. 4(c)–(g)). Typically, two oxygen atoms are consumed to stoichiometrically convert one C atom into a CO2 molecule. For the first release of lattice oxygen, three sites are available for Co-CeO2 (Figs. 4(c), (d) and S14), and the O atom in Ce–O–Co is the most reactive, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy (E Vo) of –0.06 eV, which is reduced compared with pristine CeO2 (+2.59 eV). There are two possible pathways for the formation of a second VO: direct and migration removal processes. For the former, no evident difference is observed between the two surfaces studied (Fig. 4(e)). Interestingly, in addition to the remarkable migration ability of pure CeO2, there is a larger tendency for the release of surface lattice oxygen after migration to Ce–VO–Co, with a lower energy difference than the direct release of a second lattice oxygen at a fixed position (Fig. 4(f)). For the subsequent replenishment of O2, the incorporation of Co kinetically favors the breaking of the O–O bond owing to the elimination of the original energy barrier in CeO2 (0.54 eV) (Fig. 4(g)). Overall, Co-CeO2 has superior oxygen cycling to that of CeO2, particularly for the chemical cycle of the O atom shared by Ce and Co. Therefore, we performed an electronic analysis of the Ce–O–Co unit. After the substitution of Co for Ce, electron transfer is weakened, and the Barder charge of the shared Olatt decreases from –1.19 |e| to –0.96 |e|. Additionally, we can clearly observe a strong covalency appearing on the Co–O bond according to the electron localization function (ELF) maps (Figs. 4(h), (i)), which agrees well with a smaller integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (IpCOHP) value than the Ce–O bond (1.04 vs. 1.79) (Figs. 4(j), (k)). Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the Ce–O–Co structure not only significantly reduces the activation energy of lattice oxygen in Ce–O–Co by strengthening the delocalization of the M–O bonds but also facilitates the replenishment of Vo in Ce–VO–Co. In other words, Co substitution in CeO2 forms an asymmetric coordination of cations, making oxygen “easy come, easy go” [25]. Following the above discussion, a simple mechanism for soot combustion over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ is proposed, as shown in Fig. 4(l). The Olatt in Ce–O–Co is activated by collisions with energetic electrons generated by the NTP. Activated lattice oxygen (O*) reacts with soot to produce VOs. The active oxygen species (O atoms, O2, O3, O–, and O2 –) in the plasma and the adjacent lattice oxygen migrate to fill the VO, which drives the VO to diffuse outward from the reaction site. The oxygen species adsorbed on the VO are activated by the coupling of plasma and thermal catalysis, which accelerates the reoxidation of the VO. The alternating oxidation (Ce–O–Co) and reduction (Ce–VO–Co) of the metal active sites on the catalyst surface make the supply of oxygen species the rate-determining step of soot combustion. 4 Conclusions In summary, we constructed Co-doped CeO2 with high compatibility toward NTP as an efficient soot combustion catalyst. Based on performance test results, the X C, E max, and S(CO2) of Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ reached 96.9%, 14.7 g kWh–1, and 99.0%, respectively, at 200 °C and under loose contact conditions. More importantly, even without heating, the X C, E max, and S(CO2) reached 92.1%, 6.1 g kWh–1, and 97.5% (P dis = 6.3 W), respectively. Moreover, the Ce1–x Co x O2–δ (x = 0.1–0.3) catalysts demonstrate remarkable stability and water resistance during catalytic soot oxidation. The characterization, isotope experiments, and DFT calculation results indicate that the asymmetric oxygen active sites in Ce–Co–O solid solution make lattice oxygen “easy come, easy go” by NTP below 200 °C, leading to rapid combustion of soot at low temperatures. Specifically, Olatt plays a dominant role in this reaction; NTP accelerates Olatt activation to O* and the regeneration of the generated VO during the reaction by O atoms, O2, O3, O–, and O2 – species, or adjacent lattice oxygen. This study provides insight into the activation of oxygen during low-temperature oxidation reactions and the design of efficient catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Effective lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation at low temperatures has long been a challenge in catalytic oxidation reactions. Traditional thermal catalytic soot combustion, even with Pt/Pd catalysts, is inefficient at exhaust temperatures below 200 °C, particularly under conditions of frequent idling. Herein, we report an effective strategy utilizing non-thermal plasma (NTP) to activate Olatt in Ce1–x Co x O2–δ catalysts, achieving dramatic enhancement of the soot combustion rate at low temperatures. At 200 °C and 4.3 W (discharge power, P dis), NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ achieved 96.9% soot conversion (X C), 99.0% CO2 selectivity (S(CO2)) and a maximum energy conversion efficiency (E max) of 14.7 g kWh–1. Compared with previously reported results, NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ exhibits the highest S(CO2) and E max values. Remarkably, even without heating, X C, E max, and S(CO2) reached 92.1%, 6.1 g kWh–1, and 97.5%, respectively, at 6.3 W (P dis). The results of characterization and theoretical calculation demonstrated that Co dopes into the CeO2 crystal lattice and forms an asymmetric Ce–O–Co structure, making oxygen “easy come, easy go”, thereby enabling the rapid combustion of soot over NTP-Ce0.8Co0.2O2–δ . This study highlights the great potential of NTP for activating Olatt and provides valuable insights into the design of efficient NTP-adapted catalysts for oxidation reactions.",
