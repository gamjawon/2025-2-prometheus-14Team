Graphical abstract To understand the second doped metal influence on catalytic activity for N2O decomposition, the mechanisms of N2O decomposition over Rh-M(M = Co, Ni and Cu) bimetallic catalysts were investigated by density functional theory (DFT). Co doped into Rh catalyst can increase the activity for N2O decomposition due to the decrease of the activation energy of rate-determining step while Ni and Cu present contrary performance. A series of corresponding RhM catalysts supported on SBA-15 was prepared and applied in N2O catalytic decomposition. The catalytic activity trend of Rh-M catalysts for N2O decomposition is determined as Rh7Co1/SBA-15 > Rh/SBA-15 > Rh7Ni1/SBA-15 > Rh7Cu1/SBA-15, which is in consistency with the corresponding DFT calculation results. Keywords Directly catalytic decomposition N2O Catalytic activity Density functional theory (DFT) 1 Introduction Nitrous oxide, from industrial processes and motor vehicle exhausts, has been identified as a contributor to the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere and recognized as a relatively strong greenhouse gas [1,2]. The catalytic decomposition of N2O into N2 and O2 is one of the most promising and simple way to develop clean and sustainable technology for industry at an affordable cost. Noble metallic catalysts such as Rh [3–9], Pd [10–13], and Ir [14–16] based catalysts have performed effectively for this catalytic reaction. They can efficiently decompose N2O at the temperatures of 250–350 °C. Unfortunately, Noble catalysts are not widely applied in industrial scale due to their high cost. On the other hand, many non-noble transition metals show moderate activity for N2O decomposition in the temperature range of 450–600 °C [17–20]. In Abu-Zied’s work [21], they prepared rare earth (RE) ions promoted NiO catalysts by the microwave-assisted method. Over RE-promoted NiO catalysts, N2O (500 ppm in He, 200 mL/min−1) was completely converted at 500 °C, which is much more efficient than bare NiO catalyzed N2O decomposition. Kotarba’s group [22,23] applied doubly promoted K/Zn–Co3O4 spinel catalyst catalysts in large scale test of N2O decomposition. In their works, doubly promoted K/Zn–Co3O4 spinel catalyst in the deN2O reaction was tested for 10 weeks in a nitric acid pilot plant, which is a remarkable potential application in industry. Doping transition metal into noble metallic catalysts to prepare the bimetallic catalysts is a common method to reduce catalyst costs. In addition, bimetallic catalysts often present superior performance compared to monometallic catalysts because of synergistic effect [24–26]. Tabor et al. revealed the presence of metallic Pt clusters highly enhances catalytic activity of iron ferrierite in N2O decomposition, even at low Pt loading [27]. Bimetallic Pt0.41/Fe0.8-FER catalysts performed high activity in N2O decomposition at 450 °C. Hua et al. prepared Rh/Zn-Al2O3 for high concentration N2O decomposition. Complete conversion of 0.5% N2O in He on Rh/Zn-Al2O3 at about 270 °C is lower than that on Rh-Al2O3, which indicates that doped Zn promotes the activity of Rh [28]. As it is difficult to find appropriate bimetallic catalysts from a mass of potential metals, how to effectively design a bimetallic catalyst for N2O decomposition is attracting a lot of attentions from researchers. Understanding the reaction mechanism is important for the design of efficient catalysts for N2O decomposition [11,29–32]. Density functional theory (DFT) can be often used to provide information regarding the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis and the intrinsic properties of materials [31]. Several studies have achieved success in catalyst design at atomic level by DFT calculations and experimental demonstration [33,34]. In our previous work [35], we predicted the catalytic activity of Rh, Pd, Pt and Ni for N2O decomposition. Among the four catalysts, Rh presents the highest catalytic activity, In this work, Rh-based bimetallic catalysts by doped with transition metal were investigated. According to analysis of mechanism of N2O decomposition over Rh-M(M = Co, Cu and Ni) bimetallic catalysts, the activity of these catalysts was predicted, and then the Rh-M bimetallic catalysts were prepared and tested, which agrees well with DFT calculation. 2 Computational and experimental details 2.1 Computational method Geometry optimizations and the transition state searches were performed with the program package DMol3 in the Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using exchange-correlation functional developed by PW91 was employed and the localized double-numerical basis setting with polarization functions (DNP) were used. The core electrons of the metal atoms were treated using the effective core potentials (ECP). The calculations with 4.5 Å global orbital cutoff values were performed. In addition, the convergence criteria for configuration optimization was set to the tolerance for SCF, energy, maximum force, and a maximum displacement of 1.0 e−5 Ha, 2.0 e−5 Ha, 0.004 Ha/Å and 0.005 Å, respectively. The periodic surfaces in the study of the catalytic mechanism were modeled using four-layer slabs inside a 2 × 2 unit cell that is separated from its neighboring images by a 12 Å width vacuum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid. The geometries of the adsorbates and the top two layers of the metal surface were allowed to relax while the bottom two layers were frozen during the geometry optimizations. With the optimized geometric structures, the mechanisms for N2O decomposition on Rh-M surfaces were explored with the transition states determined by using the complete LST/QST method. The transition state structures were determined accordingly and proved to have only single imaginary frequency that corresponds to the reaction pathway from the reactant to the product. The adsorption energy is calculated using the following equation: E a d s = E A / s l a b − E s l a b − E A ( g ) where EA/slab is the total energy of the slab with an adsorbate bound to it, Eslab is the energy of the clean metal slab, EA(g) is the energy of the adsorbate in gas-phase. For a N2O decomposition reaction on Rh-M surface, the energy barrier (Eb ) are calculated on the basis of the following formulas: E b = E T S − E I S Where EIS is the total energy of initial state and the ETS is the total energy of transition state. The d-band center defined as the center of mass of the density of states projected onto the d states is calculated using the following equation. C d − b a n d = E d N d = ∫ − ∞ 0 ρ E d E ∫ − ∞ 0 ρ d E where Ed is the total energy of occupied d electrons, Nd the total number of occupied d electrons, and ρ the density of d states. 2.2 Catalysts preparation The Rh-M (M = Co, Cu, Ni) bimetallic catalysts on SBA-15 were prepared as follows: (1) a certain amount of metal precursor, RhCl3·3H2O and doped metallic nitrate salt with desired Rh and M loadings, was added into 1 g of support ultrasonicly dispersed in 50 mL and stirred for 1 h. (2) After impregnating, the precursors were filtrated and then heat-dried at 110 °C for 2 h and then the sample was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h (heating rate10 °C/min) in air. (3) The catalysts were treated in a flow of H2 at 550 °C for 2 h followed by a cooling to room temperature under H2 ambience. 2.3 Catalysts characterization and evaluation The surface areas were analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was carried out on a FEI tecnai F20 instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm, 36 kV, 20 mA, scanning step = 10°/min) in the 2 range 5–80°. Catalytic tests were carried out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor equipped with an online gas chromatograph (Fuli 9790II GC equipped with chromosorb, Porapaq Q and Molecular Sieve 5A columns) for the continuous analysis of reaction products. 0.5 g catalyst in the form of particles Tests was loaded. The uniform axial temperature profile of the catalytic bed was monitored using a thermocouple. Calculation of the turnover frequency (TOF): TOF = M N 2 M R h × t i m e Where MN2 is mol of N2 conversion; MRh is mol of Rh on catalyst. Corrected TOF = TOF × percentage of catalytically active Rh atoms Number of Rh atoms in nanoparticle, n = ( N 0 ρ ( 4 3 ) π ( D 2 ) 3 ) W where n = number of Rh atoms N0 = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 D = diameter of rhodium nanoparticles W = atomic weight of rhodium (102.91 g/mol) ρ= room-temperature density of rhodium (12.41 g/cm3) Number of Rh atoms on the surface of Nanoparticles n s = 4 π ( D 2 ) 2 ( 2 r ) 2 r = atomic radius of rhodium (0.135 nm). For turnover frequency measurements, N2O conversion was maintained at less than ∼15%, thus ensuring that the reactor was operated under differential conditions [36–38]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst surface models According to our previous research, Rh(111) surface presents lowest surface energy [35]. We calculated the possible structure of M doping in Rh(111) surface and subsurface. The calculation results are listed in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 1, doped M on Rh(111) surface is marked as RhM and doped M in Rh(111) subsurface is marked as RhM’. The surface energy (Es) of RhM is close to Es of Rh surface, which indicates RhM is stable. Es of RhM is lower than that of RhM’ suggesting RhM is more stable than RhM’. In addition, N2O adsorption energy (Eads) on RhM’ is close to that on Rh surface. It means we can ignore the effect of doped M in Rh subsurface on N2O decomposition. Noted that M surface energy is lower than RhM surface energy, which means M tend to be clustered. We choose RhM model in this research as we want to investigate the synergistic effect between the doped M atom and adjacent Rh atoms. The model is four layers which two upper layers are relaxed. M atom doping in Rh with 15:1 Rh/M ratio is consistent with catalysts preparation in experiments. 3.2 Mechanism of N2O decomposition on Rh-M surface (111) N2O decomposition mechanism contains N2O dissociation and O2 formation. We firstly determine the feasible location sites for N2O on the Rh-M bimetallic catalyst surface and then analyze the mechanism of N2O dissociation. Two typical adsorption sites, including top and flat sites, are considered. The geometric structures of N2O decomposition reaction are shown in Fig. 2 . The potential energy profile (Fig. 4) with the calculated adsorption energies and energy barriers is analyzed to understand the mechanism of catalytic reaction. N2O dissociation over catalyst surface is analyzed as two elementary reactions, i.e., the adsorption of N2O and decomposition step of N2O to N2 (a) and O(a) atom on metal surface. Starting from N2O top adsorption mode, the most stable adsorption [30,35], two transition states must be overcome to form adsorbed nitrogen and adsorbed oxygen atom. As seen from Fig. 4, the barriers energy of the first elementary reaction is higher than that of the second elementary reaction in N2O dissociation on these surfaces except RhCu surface. The N2O dissociation into N2 and O(a) is also affected by the doping of M atoms on the surface. In the first elementary reaction, the terminal N atom of N2O approximately erectly adsorbs on top site of Rh atom over Rh surface [Fig. 2(a1)], then N2O turns over and O atom adsorbs on the adjacent Rh atom [Fig. 2(a3)]. In the second elementary reaction, the NO bond cracks and N2(a) and O(a) adsorb on top site of adjacent Rh atoms respectively [Fig. 2(a5)]. N2O dissociation on RhCo surface is similar to that on Rh surface [Fig. 2(b1)–(b5)]. However, after the doping of Ni and Cu atom on the Rh surface, the second elementary reaction shows a little difference from that on monometallic Rh surface. The presence of Ni and Cu in the surface affects the adsorption of N2O in the way that the O atom of N2O adsorbs on bridge site of Rh-Ni and Rh-Cu atoms [Fig. 2(c3, d3)]. After the NO bond cracking, the N2 still adsorbs on top site of Rh atom while the O adsorbs on the hcp site of Rh-Ni and Rh-Cu surface [Fig. 2(c5, d5)]. The geometric structures for the elementary steps of O2 formation over Rh-M surfaces are shown in Fig. 3 and the energy profiles with corresponding energetics are also summarized in Fig. 4 . The energy barriers of O2 formation are higher than that of N2O dissociation, which indicates the process of O2 formation is the rate-determining step. The O2 formation is favorable thermodynamically on RhCo surface with the lowest energy barrier among the Rh-M surface. However, the formation of O2 from 2Oad is not favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically over Rh, RhNi and RhCu surface. DFT calculations demonstrate that the doping of Co into Rh can promote the catalytic activity while Ni and Cu inhibit the catalytic activity for N2O decomposition. As seen from Fig. 3, one of the O atoms prefers to close M atom and then adsorbs on bridge site over RhCo, Rh and RhNi surface. However, O atom is not favorable to close Cu atom and then adsorb on top site of Rh atom. The reason is that the outermost d orbital of Cu is occupied while the d orbital of Co, Rh and Ni are unoccupied [39,40]. Especially, Co tends to accept the electron provided by O2 than others. The d-band center has been found to be an important descriptor of electronic properties for predicting trends of adsorption energies on many monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The electronic properties of metal surface can be reflected by deviation between d-band center of metal and the Fermi level, which can reflect the ability of adsorption on Rh-M surface [33,41]. Therefore, the N2O, O2 and N2 adsorption energy was calculated for each of the Rh-M bimetallic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , the adsorption energies increased as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level. There is a nearly linear trend in the adsorption energies of adsorbate versus the metal surface d-band center. The adsorption energies get lower as the d-band center approaches to the Fermi level. It clearly shows that the farther the d-band center is from the Fermi energy, the weaker the adsorption of N2O molecule is on the surface. The introduction of the second metal will change the charge density of the bimetallic surface, which can affect the adsorption ability of adsorbate. 3.3 Experimental results A series of metallic catalysts with different Rh/M ratio were prepared for N2O catalytic decomposition. Fig. 6 shows RhxM1/SBA-15 catalytic activity tested in 450 °C. The Rh/M ratio of Rh15M1/SBA-15 is consistent with the Rh/M ratio of calculation model. The catalytic activity trend of Rh15M1/SBA-15 for N2O decomposition is determined as Rh15Co1 > Rh > Rh15Ni1 > Rh15Cu1, which is agreeable with the corresponding calculation results. The activity of RhCo/SBA-15 increases as Rh/Co ratio decreases. However, the activity decreases when the Rh/Co ratio reaches to 3:1. Unlike RhCo/SBA-15, the activity of RhNi/SBA-15 and RhCu/SBA-15 decreases as Rh/M ratio decreases. Rh7Co1/SBA-15 presents the best catalytic activity for N2O decomposition at 450 °C so we choose Rh7M1/SBA-15 for further study. Table 1 lists actual metal loadings of Rh7M1/SBA-15 catalysts and their BET surface areas are about 520 m2/g. XRD patterns of four catalysts in Fig. 7 show that Rh7M1/SBA-15 has diffraction peaks at 2θ = 41.1°, 47.8°, 70.0°, which are characteristic peaks of Rh. The characteristic peaks of Co, Cu and Ni are not found in XRD pattern, indicating they are uniformly doped in Rh. The size of RhM bimetallic particles calculated by Scherrer equation is also listed in Table 1. The nanoparticles are well dispersed in mesoporous channels of SBA-15 shown in Fig. 8 . As seen in TEM images, the size of nanoparticles is less than 10 nm, which agrees well with the calculation results by XRD. The catalytic activities of these Rh7M1/SBA-15 catalysts in N2O conversion reaction were tested from 100 °C to 550 °C, as shown in Fig. 9 . N2O was completely converted at 450 °C on Rh7Co1/SBA-15 which presents the best catalytic activity among Rh7M1/SBA-15 catalysts. The catalytic activity for N2O decomposition decreases with Ni and Cu doping, with which N2O can’t be completely converted at 450 °C. T50, the temperature of 50% N2O conversion, was used as the measure standard for comparison of catalytic activity. T50 of each catalyst decreases in the following order: Rh7Cu1/SBA-15 > Rh7Ni1/SBA-15 > Rh/SBA-15 > R7hCo1/SBA-15, suggesting the required activity energies for N2O decomposition on these catalysts gradually decrease. To gain more insight into the effect of doped M on intrinsic activity of catalysts, the Turnover frequencies (TOFs) of N2O decomposition are depicted as a function of 1/T (Arrhenius plot, Fig. 10 ). The results clearly demonstrate the superior activity of Rh7Co1/SBA-15. This result is consistent with our DFT calculation that the energy barrier of rate-determining step determines the catalytic activity. As can be seen from the results, the addition of Co promotes the activity of Rh catalyst for N2O conversion. In order to understand the difference of catalysts with M doping, XPS studies were carried out to get a deeper insight into the chemical state of Rh and M on the catalyst surface after activity test. The top image in Fig. 11 a displays Rh species of the fresh Rh/SBA-15 catalysts while the bottom image displays Rh species of the used Rh/SBA-15 catalysts. Rh3d5/2 peak with binding energy of 307 eV and Rh3d3/2 peak with binding energy of 311.8 eV are corresponded to the Rh0 species, suggesting Rh in fresh catalyst and used catalyst are both Rh0 species. This result suggests Rh species in Rh/SBA-15 is stable after reaction. In Fig. 11b(2) and b(4), Co2p3/2 peak with binding energy of 777.9 eV and Co2p1/2 peak with binding energy of 792.9 eV corresponding to the Co0 species don’t change after reaction. Like Rh species, Co species is also stable after reaction. It means that RhCo/SBA-15 catalyst is not oxidized by N2O in catalytic reaction. As seen in Fig. 11c(4), Cu 2p3/2 peak at 933.6 eV and Cu 2p1/2 peak at 953.6 eV corresponding to the Cu2+ species are observed, which means part of Cu species is oxidized by N2O in reaction. In Fig. 11d(4), Ni oxidization also was observed after reaction. Ni 2p3/2 peak at 854.3 eV and Ni 2p1/2 peak at 872.7 eV correspond to the Ni2+ species. XPS results indicate Cu and Ni species are easy to be oxidized in reaction. According to DFT calculation, the recombination of two neighboring O to form O2 on RhNi and RhCu surface have a high barrier than that on RhCo surface. It indicates O is difficult to desorb from RhNi and RhCu surface because O greatly interact with Ni and Cu atom explored on surface. The reason is that O prefers to adsorb on RhNi and RhCu surface, which inhibits N2O decomposition. 4 Conclusion In summary, DFT calculations indicate that introduction of the second metal into Rh catalysts results in the change of catalytic activity. The presence of Co atoms indeed helps the N2O decomposition while Ni and Cu inhibit the catalytic activity. Over RhCo surface, the rate-determining step, O2 formation process, has the lowest energy barrier compared with other RhM surface, leading to the highest activity in N2O conversion. The energy barrier of O2 formation process increases with Ni and Cu doping, suggesting that the catalytic activity would decrease over the RhNi and RhCu surface. A series of catalysts was prepared to verify the results of DFT calculation. Rh7Co1/SBA-15 catalyst presents the highest activity for N2O decomposition among the four RhM catalysts. Because of Ni and Cu species oxidization, the catalytic activity for N2O decomposition will decrease with Ni and Cu doping. The experimental results are consistent with DFT calculation results.
