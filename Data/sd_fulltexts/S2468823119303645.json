IV-A, Km 396 Córdoba E14014 Spain Graphical abstract Several catalysts with a 10 wt% loading of zirconium supported on BEA-75 (Si/Al = 37.5) and ZSM-5 (with two different Si/Al = ratio of 15 and 25, respectively) zeolites have been synthesized via ball-milling (mechanochemistry). Samples were characterized by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The incorporation of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the zeolitic material lead to the formation of catalysts with the ability of transform methyl levulinate into γ-valerolactone (GVL). However, the selectivity towards GVL was negatively affected due to side reactions caused by both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites on the zeolites employed as support. The role of each acid site in the selected reaction could be addressed by selective poisoning with different bases (pyridine and 2.6-dimethylpiridine). In general, the deactivation of the active sites by the different bases significantly increased the selectivity towards GVL, completely quenching competitive side reactions, pointing out GVL formation can be promoted by Zr(IV) species according to the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) mechanism. Keywords Methyl levulinate γ-Valerolactone Zirconium oxide Zeolite Continuous flow Acidity 1 Introduction The growing number of factors influencing the production of fuels and chemicals from fossil sources, such as political and environmental, has promoted research on the development of routes starting from alternative raw materials [1,2]. Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive alternative, being widely available and advantageous as non-edible feedstock. The three major constituent of such lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin whose relative ratio is going to be dependent on the type of feeedstock. Among them, the most important fraction is cellulose, around a 38–50% of the biomass composition it also the most widely investigated for its conversion into other valuable chemicals [3]. The cellulose fraction is a very important renewable source for the production of platform chemicals, such as levulinic acid, the main product in the hydrolysis/dehydration of hexoses, such as glucose and fructose, or polymers containing hexose units including starch and cellulose [3]. Levulinic acid can be converted into very attractive products including succinamides, pyrrolidones and tetrahydrofuran by different chemical reactions (amidation, reductive amination, hydrogenation, etc.) [4]. An important lignocellulosic biomass derivative is ϒ-valerolactone (GVL), produced via hydrogenation of levulinic acid [5] or alkyl levulinates, being a biorenewable organic compound with a characteristic smelling, immiscible with water and employed among other applications as green solvent [6,7], fuel and fuel additive [8,9]. There are many different alternatives for the catalytic hydrogenation of either levulinic acid or methyl levulinate [10,11]. Focusing on heterogeneous catalysts, the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to GVL has been reported mainly by the use of noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Ru supported on carbon [8,12], using molecular hydrogen. Alternatively, it is possible to use H-donor solvents with several advantages as compared to molecular hydrogen mainly related with safety handling. Specifically, the use of alcohols as hydrogen source to produce GVL from alkyl levulinates via catalytic transfer hydrogenation has been reported. For instance, using this approach and Au/ZrO2 catalyst was possible to obtain GVL from different lignocellulosic sources with good yield [13]. Another interesting approach is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) that gives as result a high catalytic activity under mild condition using zeolites and metal oxides as catalysts [5]. This approach was firstly reported for the conversion of levulinic acid and its esters by Dumesic and co-workers [14] using ZrO2 as catalysts and 2-butanol as solvent. Other Zr-based catalyst have been reported to catalyse the transformation of alkyl levulinate to GVL following a MPV mechanism including MOFs [15], basic zirconium carbonate [16], and ZrO2 supported materials on SBA-15 silicates [17,18]. Additionally, bifunctional materials such as zirconium modified zeolites have been investigated for the one-pot transformation of xylose to GVL [19,20]. The main difficulty that lignocellulosic biomass valorisation processes must address relate to achieving high yields towards the desired product. In this sense, continuous flow systems offer advantages over a batch reactor such as better control of reaction conditions (conversion, selectivity), easy scale-up and minimize catalyst manipulation [21–24]. Herein, we report the synthesis of zeolites supported ZrO2 catalysts via ball-milling (mechanochemistry) and evaluated the role that acid sites as well as zirconium play in the continuous flow transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived methyl levulinate to GVL using 2-propanol as hydrogen donating solvent. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials preparation The materials used to carry out this work were employed as received without further purification. Methyl levulinate used as substrate for the hydrogenation reaction was provided by Avantium as by-product from the YXY process after further purification [25]. ZrO(NO3)2 xH2O, employed as metal salt precursor, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-propanol used as hydrogen donor solvent for the transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate was purchased from Merck. Zeolites with different frameworks (ZSM-5 and BEA) and Si/Al (30, 50 and 75) molar ratios and frameworks were obtained from Zeolyst International Inc. Zeolites transformed into their respective H-form by thermal treatment at 600 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The preparation of supported ZrO2 on zeolites was carried out following a protocol previously reported by our research group [26]. According to this protocol, the preparation of supported metal oxide nanoparticles takes place by grinding together the zeolite, used as support, and the appropriate amount of ZrO(NO3)2 xH2O, employed as Zr salt precursor, to achieve a metal loading 10 wt. % at 350 r.p.m. for 10 min. The final catalyst was obtained by calcination at 400 °C for 4 h. The materials prepared in this way were: Zr10/HZSM-5(30), Zr10/HZSM-5(50), Zr10/HBEA(75), where the numbers in brackets relate to SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio in the zeolites. 2.2 Materials characterisation The textural properties of the materials prepared were evaluated by N2 adsorption/desorption measurement using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Samples were outgassed at 130 °C for 24 h (P < 0.1 Pa) prior to analysis. BET surface has been calculated in the interval P/Po = 0.05-0.30, assuming that the nitrogen surface is 0.162 nm2. XRD diffractograms of the materials employed in this work have been acquired in a Bruker model DISCOVER D8 diffractogram. The line CuK α (λ = 1,5406 Å) has been used with a scan in the range 10° < 2θ < 80° and a goniometer speed of 0.5°/min. Elemental analysis and mapping of the elements in the synthesised materials were performed using a scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM 7800 F equipped with a X-max 150 microanalysis system, Si/Li detector, with a detection range from boron to uranium and a resolution of 127 eV. The surface acid properties were evaluated using a chromatographic pulse method using pyridine (PY) and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (DMPY) as bases, due to their selective adsorption over Brönsted and Lewis acid sites and Brönsted acid sites, respectively. The acidity measurements have been carried out at 300 °C. The pulses to the catalyst bed have been performed via a microinyector using a cyclohexanic solution of the probe molecule (0.989 M in Py and 0.686 M in DMPY, respectively). Prior to the analysis, the catalyst have been standardised in a dehydrated nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min during one hour at 300 °C. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was employed to characterise the used catalysts using an ABB MB3000 provided with a Pike diffuse reflectance accessory DiffusIR with 8 cm−1 of resolution and 256 scans. The spectra were acquired in the wavenumber range between 4000 and 600 cm−1 using KBr as reference. 2.3 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of as-synthesised materials was evaluated in the transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate to γ-valerolactone using a Phoenix™ continuous flow reactor (ThalesNano, https://thalesnano.com/products/phoenix-flow-reactor/) and 2-propanol as hydrogen donor solvent, at 200 °C and 30 bar pressure. In a typical experiment, 0.3 M methyl levulinate in 2-propanol was passed through the catalyst bed (˜0.5 g) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Additionally, to study the role of the acid sites in the system, a 0.3 M methyl levulinate and 0.01 M solution in PY was passed through the catalyst bed under same conditions mentioned before. Samples were withdrawn at 15, 30 and 60 min, once achieved steady state (corresponding to residence times of the feed in the catalyst ca. 40, 80 and 160 s). The reaction mixture was analysed using an Agilent 5890 series II gas chromatograph, fitted with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a non-polar fused silica ihydroxy column SUPELCO EQUITY TM-1 (60 m × 0,25 mm × 0,25 μm). 3 Results and discussion The zirconium loaded zeolites as well as the parent support materials investigated in this work are essentially microporous materials, exhibiting textural properties typical for microporous materials. The incorporation of ZrO2 on the different zeolites used as support leads to a decrease in surface area ca. 30% as compared to their respective parent zeolites (Table 1S). This is indicative of the different interactions that take place during the milling process used for the preparation of the catalysts such as dehydroxylation of the zeolite, the reaction between the external silanol groups and the zirconium salt precursor, and, eventually, the partial blockage of the micropores in the zeolite by ZrO2 particles. XRD diffractograms corresponding to the material Zr10/HBEA(75), and its respective support are shown on Fig. 1 (XRD diffractograms for the remaining materials are shown on Figs. S1, S2). The parent zeolites used as catalytic support displayed the typical diffraction patterns of these crystalline materials [27]. Such crystallinity of the zeolites employed as support slightly decreased upon the milling step used in the preparation of the ZrO2 loaded materials, preserving the distinctives diffraction lines characteristics for each zeolite. Additionally, the incorporation of zirconium was confirmed by the presence of diffraction lines corresponding to ZrO2 in its cubic phase. The particle size of zirconium oxide loaded on zeolites was estimated using the Scherrer equation to be ca. 24.9 nm for Zr10%HBEA75. For the remaining Zr-loaded materials, particle size evaluation as well as phase identification was not possible due to the higher crystallinity of ZSM-5 zeolites, whose diffraction lines overlap with the signal corresponding to the zirconium phase as well as Zr content in the materials (Table 1 ). The elemental composition of the samples was evaluated by EDS/SEM, showing lower Zr loadings as compared to the theoretical expected (Table 1, typically below 5%). This fact could be explained by the semi-quantitative character of the characterisation technique, together with the not uniform dispersion of ZrO2 nanoparticles over the different zeolites, confirmed by mapping images for the different elements existing in the investigated samples (Fig. 2 ). As expected, mapping images for Al and Si display and homogeneous distribution for these two elements as compared to the formation of aggregates observed for Zr, in good agreement with the particle size measured for Zr10/HBEA(75). The evaluation of the acidic properties for the materials investigated in the study was carried out by GC titration at 300 °C using pyridine (PY) and 2,6-dimethylpiridine (DMPY) as probe molecules (Table 2 ). Acidity measurements revealed the acidic character and strength of the acid sites in the investigated materials. The incorporation of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the investigated zeolites resulted in a marked decreased in both Brönsted and Lewis acidity caused by the milling process used for the materials preparation due to zeolite dehydroxylation and the reactions of the metal salt precursor with surface hydroxyl groups on the zeolite as well as micropores blockage [26]. The influence of such acidic properties in the transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor solvent was subsequently investigated under continuous flow conditions. Firstly, the catalytic activity of as-prepared materials using reaction conditions previously optimized by our research group was screened [28], namely 0.3 M methyl levulinate solution in 2-propanol at 200 °C using a pressure of 30 bar and a flow rate 0.2 mL/min. Using these experimental conditions, the catalytic activity of parent zeolites as well as the supported ZrO2 materials are shown in Fig. 3 . ML conversion was close to 80% for all investigated catalysts, with slightly decreased conversion after the modification with ZrO2. Interestingly, the selectivity to the target product, ϒ-valerolactone, was almost negligible in all cases. The main reaction products were levulinic acid, produced via hydrolysis of methyl levulinate, and isopropyl levulinate, the transesterification product, with selectivity values around 40 % and 60% respectively. Such side reactions displayed on Scheme 1 , which are competing with the transfer hydrogenation process for the substrate (ML), are typically catalysed by the acid sites existing on zeolites [29,30]. The actual role that acidity plays in the transfer hydrogenation of ML by Zrloaded materials was then investigated. Subsequent experiments were designed in a way that both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites were poisoned with pydirine (PY) which interacts indiscriminately with both types of acid sites. With this purpose a 0.3 M methyl levulinate solution in 2-propanol was prepared also with a low concentration of pyridine (0.01 M) and continuously fed to the system. The continuous poisoning with pyridine of the zeolitic materials HBEA(75) as well as HZSM-5(50), used as supports, leads to the complete deactivation of both catalysts to any reactions depicted in Scheme 1 (ML hydrogenation, hydrolysis or transesterification reactions). Interestingly, (un)selective poisoning of ZrO2-containing zeolite catalysts provided revealing results with useful information for future catalyst design towards highly active and fully selective systems in the transformation of methyl levulinate into GVL. In this way, PY poisoning for Zr10/HBEA(75) originated a decreased ML conversion (from 66 to 45.6%) with remarkably improved selectivity to GVL that increases from ca. 30% to 96% (Fig. 4 ). The observed decreased conversion could be somehow expected due to poisoning of the weak Lewis acidity present in zirconia systems [31]. Significantly, the results obtained for Zr10/HZSM-5(50) also revealed a faster deactivation of the acid sites on the material, reaching complete selectivity towards GVL after 15 min on stream once steady state was achieved (equivalent to ca. 40 s residence time). This different behaviour between Zr10/HBEA(75) and Zr10/HZSM-5(50) materials can explained by the strength of the acid sites on each zeolite, with ZSM-5 zeolite having stronger acid sites as compared to BEA zeolites [32]. The effect of selectively quenching Brönsted acid sites was subsequently investigated using 2,6-dimethylpyridine (DMPY) that specifically interacts with these acid sites [33]. The results are shown on Fig. 5 for Zr10/HMEA(75), revealing a stronger interaction of DMPY with the acid sites on the catalyst as compared to pyridine in essence providing a complete GVL selectivity rather stable with time on stream, with conversion decreasing to ca. 40% and further down to 30–35% at longer time of reactions (2–6 h). In view of the observed facts, Brönsted as well as Lewis acid sites favour ML hydrolysis and transesterification reactions that compete with the MPV transfer hydrogenation process of ML, which is minimized in the presence of such active sites. The observed MPV reaction from methyl levulinate to γ-valerolactone is closely related to the presence of ZrO2 nanoparticles, since the acidity of the investigated zeolites does not promote any GVL formation. Consequently, ML hydrogenation takes place through the previously reported mechanism involving the formation of alkoxide species between ZrO2 and the hydrogen donor solvent used to perform the reaction. ML is then adsorbed and hydrogen transfer from the alcohol occurs followed by an eventual intramolecular dealcoholisation to GVL formation [17]. Long-term methyl levulinate hydrogenation reaction studies were performed using Zr10/HBEA(75) catalyst for 12 h to evaluate the possible deactivation of the catalyst with time-on-stream (Fig. S3). After 12 h on stream, the selectivity towards GVL was not significanty affected, while methyl levulinate conversion slightly increased. Additional characterization was performed by DRIFT measurements of the catalyst before and after reaction in the presence of pyridine. The spectra corresponding to the fresh and used Zr10/HBEA(75) catalyst acquired at 100 °C and the related to the used material recorded at 300 °C are shown in Fig. 6 . The IR spectrum corresponding to the fresh Zr10/HBEA(75) shows a characteristic band a band at 3749 cm−1 assigned to isolated terminal SiOH groups that completely disappeared for the spent catalysts due to interaction with pyridine. In addition, it is possible to observe a broad band at 3600 cm−1 that can be correlated to bridging hydroxyl groups whose intensity decrease for the used Zr10/HBEA(75) recorded at 300 °C [34]. Another significant difference between the used and fresh catalyst can be observed in the region around 2980 cm−1 that may correspond to CH2 asymmetric stretching and a small shoulder around 2890 cm−1 related to CH2 symmetric stretching, due to the adsorption of any of compounds involved in the hydrogenation reaction that may cause the observed initial decrease (first few minutes of reaction, see supporting information long term run experiment). Importantly, these results brings to light the low feasibility of working with bifunctional catalysts (acid and redox properties) for biomass valorisation processes as proposed in the literature by other authors13b, due to the occurrence of side reactions which reduce the availability of substrate needed for the main process. In the light of these results, continuous flow processes with sequential reactors are comparably preferred, maximising in this way both activity and selectivity towards targeted product/s. 4 Conclusions In the present work, various catalysts have been synthesized following a simple and sustainable mechanochemical process. The catalysts were prepared by incorporating 10 wt% of Zr over different zeolites (HBEA(75), HZSM-5(50) and HZSM-5(30)). The as-synthesized materials have been characterized by several techniques including SEM, XDR, etc. The incorporation of Zr nanoparticles (in the form of ZrO2) leads to a reduction in surface area and surface acid properties. Studies of the transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate to γ-valerolactone under continuous flow conditions allowed us to de-link the catalytic activity to the formation of GVL from ML in the presence of acid sites, regardless of Brönsted or Lewis type. Importantly, (un)selective poisoning renders highly selective catalysts for GVL production at the expense of a reduction in the conversion of the systems. These findings demonstrated the usefulness of continuous flow processes for biomass conversion aiming to high conversion and selectivity.

The incorporation of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the zeolitic material lead to the formation of catalysts with the ability of transform methyl levulinate into γ-valerolactone (GVL). However, the selectivity towards GVL was negatively affected due to side reactions caused by both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites on the zeolites employed as support. The role of each acid site in the selected reaction could be addressed by selective poisoning with different bases (pyridine and 2.6-dimethylpiridine). In general, the deactivation of the active sites by the different bases significantly increased the selectivity towards GVL, completely quenching competitive side reactions, pointing out GVL formation can be promoted by Zr(IV) species according to the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) mechanism.",
