Graphical abstract The title complexes are excellent catalysts for a variety of additions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to CC or NN linkages, but an apex must be removed to give a C 3 coordination plane of three NH2 groups for appreciable enantioselectivities to be observed. Four known chiral enantiopure octahedral cobalt(III) trichloride salts with aliphatic hexaamine ligands are converted to new CH2Cl2 soluble tris(tetraarylborate) or 3BArf − salts (BArf = B(3,5-C6H3(CF3)2)4 in biphasic reactions. These include sepulchrate and sarcophagine complexes in which the hexaamine ligands are bicyclic (Z(CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2)3Z, Z=N, CX), as well as a truncated sarcophagine in which a missing carbon vertex renders the ligand acyclic and tripodal, with three terminal NH2 groups that define a trigonal C 3 symmetric face (CH3C(CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)3). In the presence of tertiary amine bases, these are effective catalysts for two Michael type carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and a related carbon-nitrogen bond forming reaction. However, only the last complex affords significant enantioselectivities (30–57% ee). Rationales, and directions for future catalyst optimization, are proposed. Keywords Sepulchrate complexes Sarcophagine complexes Cobalt Hydrogen bonding Enantioselective catalysis Hexaamine ligands Werner complexes Introduction The last twenty years have seen the extensive development of chiral hydrogen bond donor catalysts for enantioselective organic synthesis [1]. Nearly all of these were metal-free (organic) species prior to our report of the use of a lipophilic salt of a classical enantiopure Werner trication, Λ-[Co(en)3]3+ 3BArf − (I; en = 1,2-ethylenediamine; BArf = B(3,5-C6H3(CF3)2)4) or the enantiomer [2]. This strong NH hydrogen bond donor [3] is depicted in Fig. 1 . Since then, we have continued to develop a range of cobalt(III) tris(diprimary 1,2-diamine) catalysts [4–7] such as Λ-[Co((S,S)-dpen)3]3+ 2Cl−BArf − (II; dpen = 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine) [7] and the bifunctional species III [5,8], as well as much different systems such as the ruthenium adducts IV, which feature NH hydrogen bond donors remote from the metal [9,10]. Others [11–13], especially the Meggers group [13], have explored complementary motifs, usually with NH donor groups remote from the metal as exemplified by V. Since Werner's time, the coordination chemistry of cobalt(III) has expanded beyond diprimary 1,2-diamines to include a number of macrobicyclic hexadentate ligands featuring secondary amine moieties. Prominent classes include the sepulchrates (sep) and sarcophagines (sar), as illustrated by VIa and VIb in Fig. 1 [14]. These ligands, which have been applied to a variety of other transition metal ions [14–18], confer inherently greater thermodynamic stabilities as compared to hexa(monoamine) or tris(1,2-diamine) analogs [14,19]. Many of these complexes can be synthesized from [Co(en)3]3+ 3X− using inexpensive reagents such as formaldehyde, ammonium hydroxide, and nitromethane [15,18,20,21]. Like their precursor, they possess metal centered chirality and idealized D 3 symmetry, as represented by the partial structures in Fig. 2 . The Δ enantiomer can be viewed as a right handed helix, as the chelates extend in a clockwise direction when bridging from the front to the rear trigonal coordination planes; for the Λ enantiomer, the chelates extend in a counter-clockwise direction [22]. In most cases, the enantiomers can be resolved by fractional crystallization of their diastereomeric tartrate salts [14,23–25]. Alternatively, enantiopure adducts can be accessed from enantiopure [Co(en)3]3+ 3X− [15,20,21]. In this paper, we report that cobalt(III) complexes of the types VIa,b can in fact serve as hydrogen bond donor catalysts for various carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions. The specific systems investigated are depicted in Fig. 3 . However, the enantioselectivities are much lower than those obtained with II and III. Nonetheless, close relatives yield significant enantioselectivities, and the data provide insight that should aid future catalyst design and optimization. Results Catalyst synthesis The enantiopure chloride salts Λ-[Co((NH3)2sar)]5+ 5Cl− [18], Λ-[Co(sep)]3+ 3Cl−, Δ-[Co(sep)]3+ 3Cl− [26], Λ-[Co(sar)]3+ 3Cl− [15,27], and Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3Cl− [23,28], the cations of which are depicted in Fig. 3, were prepared according to previously reported procedures. The hexadentate ligand in Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3Cl− is acyclic. Hence, the complex is of lower symmetry than the others (C 3 vs. D 3), and possesses a trigonal coordination plane with three primary amine donor groups (−NH2). These complexes were dissolved in water, and in the case of the pentacation Λ-[Co((NH3)2sar)]5+ 5Cl−, NaOH was added to deprotonate the alkylammonium groups and generate a trication. Then CH2Cl2 solutions of Na+ BArf − (3.0 equiv) were added. The characteristic orange color of the cobalt(III) cations transferred from the upper aqueous to the lower CH2Cl2 phases, as depicted in Fig. 4 . Workups of the CH2Cl2 phases gave the corresponding tris(tetraarylborate) or 3BArf − salts in 89–98% yields as bright orange solids. These contained 4–15 water molecules per cobalt, as estimated from 1H NMR and microanalytical data. The water molecules are accounted for in all the molar quantities and yields reported herein, but for simplicity are only represented in the experimental section. To our knowledge, these represent the first lipophilic salts of the trications in Fig. 3. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of the new salts were recorded in acetone-d6, and data for all C H n and carbon signals closely matched those reported for the trichloride salts in D2O. Separate 1H NMR signals were found for the NH and NH2 protons of Λ-[Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ 3BArf −, and the NH and diastereotopic NHH' protons of Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf −. However, these peaks were not observed with the trichloride salts in D2O, presumably due to H/D exchange. All of the new salts were soluble in other moderately polar organic solvents, such as acetonitrile. Analogous anion metatheses were attempted with the trichloride salts Λ-[Co(Cl2sar)]3+ 3Cl− [27] and Λ-[Co((NO2)2sar)]3+ 3Cl− [15,27], in which more electron withdrawing substituents have replaced the apical amino groups of Λ-[Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ 3Cl−. These groups render the secondary NH units more acidic; pK a values of 8.85 (NO2) [15], 10.36 (Cl) [29], and 12.0 (NH2, chromium(III) analog) [16] have been reported. Interestingly, the initially formed bright orange CH2Cl2 solutions turned deep violet. The same color change occurs when the analogous trichloride or tris(perchlorate) salts are monodeprotonated, a process noted to happen (at least to some extent) spontaneously in the presence of organic solvents (or upon vacuum dessication) [15]. Catalyst screening Fig. 5 depicts the addition of a malonate ester to trans-ß-nitrostyrene in the presence of a tertiary amine base. This reaction could be catalyzed with high enantioselectivities by the tris(1,2-diphenylethylenediamine) complex II (Fig. 1) and related salts with 2BF4 −BArf − and 3BF4 − anion sets [4]. As summarized in entries 2–6 for additions in CD2Cl2 in the presence of Et3N, all of the cobalt(III) cage complexes were effective catalysts. Over the course of 2 h at 0 °C, >99% conversions were realized, as assayed by NMR versus an internal standard. Unfortunately, significant enantioselectivities were not achieved, as assayed by HPLC (see supporting information). The top performer was Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − with only a 10% ee (entry 6). The ee values for the hexadentate secondary amine complexes (entries 2–5) were also surpassed by that of Λ-[Co(en)3]3+ 3BArf − (I; entry 1). The dominant product configurations were determined by HPLC elution orders established previously, always with the same type of chiral column [4,30,31]. The catalyst in entry 2 features two NH2 groups, but when the experiment was repeated without added Et3N, no reaction occurred. No background reactions were detected in the absence of catalyst. Analogous experiments were also conducted in CD3CN using N-methylmorpholine as the base. Reactions became slower, but the ee values obtained with Λ-[Co(en)3]3+ 3BArf − and Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − increased significantly (Fig. 5, entries 7 and 8). Those for the other catalysts remained very low. Hence, the presence of a trigonal coordination plane with three primary amine donor groups appears to enhance enantioselectivities. Fig. 6 depicts a different type of base promoted malonate addition that we studied earlier with Δ-[Co(en)3]3+ 3BArf − (I), but could never achieve an ee value of over 33% [2]. Under the conditions of Fig. 6, the ee with I was 20% (entry 1). All of the cobalt(III) cage complexes were competent catalysts (entries 2–6), but reactions were slower than those in Fig. 5. All of the hexadentate secondary amine complexes (entries 2–5) again gave very low enantioselectivities. However, Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf −, the best performing catalyst in Fig. 5, afforded a significant enantioselectivity of 57% ee (entry 6). Fig. 7 depicts a base promoted addition of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound to an azo linkage. This transformation is catalyzed by the tris(1,2-diphenylethylenediamine) complex II, and an enantioselectivity of 76% ee was obtained using N-methylmorpholine as the base; ee values of >90% could be realized with other solvents, anion sets, or the Δ diastereomer [6a]. All cobalt(III) cage complexes were again competent catalysts, with rates generally similar to those in Fig. 5 (entries 2–6). As in Figs. 5 and 6, Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − was again the clear winner, with an ee of 40%. Finally, some data on relative catalyst rates were sought. The malonate addition in Fig. 5 was repeated, but with lower loadings of catalyst and base so as to slow the reaction and allow more precise comparisons. As shown in Fig. 8 , Λ-[Co(en)3]3+ 3BArf − (I) was the most active catalyst, followed by Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − and Λ-[Co(sar)]3+ 3BArf −. Some possible rationales are suggested in the discussion section. Discussion One of the most obvious conclusions from Figs. 5–7 is that all of the cobalt(III) catalysts derived from bicyclic hexaamine ligands (and which have D 3 symmetry) afford dismal enantioselectivities. Apparently the secondary NH moieties are effective enough hydrogen bond donors to give active catalysts, but the diastereomeric transition states leading to the different product enantiomers seem to be very close in energy. Both Λ-[Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ 3BArf − and Λ-[Co(sep)]3+ 3BArf −, which also contain RNH2 and NR3 moieties, are potentially bifunctional catalysts. However, a single run without the Et3N base (vide supra) gave no reaction, and we were discouraged from attempting additional experiments by the very low ee values. There is perhaps still some basis for cautious optimism regarding the D 3 catalysts. For certain complexes, the modes of hydrogen bonding to enantiomeric tartrate anions have been studied in detail, and it has been possible to demonstrate that one diastereomer can be substantially more favored than the other [24] – in other words, an appreciable level of chiral recognition. When high diastereoselectivities can be established for ground states, it becomes more plausible that significant selectivities can be achieved for competing transition states. Regardless, the most interesting lead that emerges from this work is the less symmetric (C 3) catalyst containing an acyclic hexaamine ligand, Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf −. This species can be formally derived from the corresponding D 3 sarcophagine (VIb, X = CH3) by removing one of the two CH3C(CH2)3 apices, thereby exposing a C 3 face that features three NH2 moieties. This motif can also be found (twice) in the tris(1,2-ethylenediamine) complex I and the tris(1,2-diphenylethylenediamine) complex II, with the latter being an enantioselective catalyst of wide applicability. For at least some reactions, there is good evidence that the C 3 face of II is the active site [4]. Also, note that the rate trends in Fig. 8 correlate to the number of C 3 faces in the catalysts. Thus, we view Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − as deserving of follow-up studies. This recommendation is bolstered by unpublished results. For example, for the addition in Fig. 6 (entry 6), Λ-[Co(sen)]3+ 3BArf − actually outperforms the tris(1,2-diphenylethylenediamine) complex Λ-[Co((S,S)-dpen)3]3+ 3BArf − [7], which gives a 47% ee under analogous conditions. Furthermore, other solvents, bases, and anion sets – at least those investigated to date – afford lower ee values. This includes the mixed salt catalyst II, which features two strongly hydrogen bonding chloride anions and gives a very sluggish reaction. Finally, we note that some of the complexes in Fig. 3 have demonstrated proficiencies as oxidative catalysts [35], electron transfer mediators [36], and photosensitizers [37]. Furthermore, analogous architectures can be developed from other cobalt(III) building blocks, such as the tris(trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine) complex [38,39]. With this work, the large class of complexes represented by Fig. 3 [14], many of which are readily available in enantiopure form, are shown to have new relevancy as potential enantioselective catalysts. Although the ee values in Figs. 5–7 are often modest, there are innumerable ways to build upon or augment the hydrogen bonding interactions that underlie the reactions. Efforts along these lines will be reported in due course. Experimental section General data All reactions were conducted under aerobic conditions.

        "dc:description": "Four known chiral enantiopure octahedral cobalt(III) trichloride salts with aliphatic hexaamine ligands are converted to new CH2Cl2 soluble tris(tetraarylborate) or 3BArf − salts (BArf = B(3,5-C6H3(CF3)2)4 in biphasic reactions. These include sepulchrate and sarcophagine complexes in which the hexaamine ligands are bicyclic (Z(CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2)3Z, Z=N, CX), as well as a truncated sarcophagine in which a missing carbon vertex renders the ligand acyclic and tripodal, with three terminal NH2 groups that define a trigonal C 3 symmetric face (CH3C(CH2NHCH2CH2NH2)3). In the presence of tertiary amine bases, these are effective catalysts for two Michael type carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and a related carbon-nitrogen bond forming reaction. However, only the last complex affords significant enantioselectivities (30–57% ee). Rationales, and directions for future catalyst optimization, are proposed.",
