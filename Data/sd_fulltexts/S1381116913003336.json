Graphical abstract A allyl-substituted salicylaldimine proligand (Scheme 1, Compound 5) was prepared by a condensation reaction, which reacted with trans-[NiCl(Ph)(PPh3)2] to give a binuclear neutral nickel (II) complex [((4-Allyl-2,6-iPr2C6H2) NCH)C6H3ONi(PPh3)Ph]2 (Scheme 1, Complex 6). The structure of the complex was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis. This novel complex bearing allyl groups can be used as a self-immobilizing catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and does not need a cocatalyst for their catalytic performance. The self-immobilizing catalytic systems not only possess high activity (up to 5.23×105 g of PE/(mol of Nih)) but also can produce high-molecular-weight polyethylenes (Mw =(0.42–0.71)×106) with relatively broad molecular weight distributions (MWD =2.83–3.11). According to the 13C NMR analyses, the resultant polyethylenes contain a few branched chains mainly consisting of methyl branches. Keywords Salicylaldimine Nickel catalyst Ethylene polymerization Self-immobilization 1 Introduction Recently, Grubbs and his co-workers have reported a new family of late-transition-metal catalysts based on neutral Ni(II) complexes containing substituted salicylaldiminato N, O ligands. These salicylaldimine-based neutral nickel (II) catalysts are capable of polymerizing ethylene to produce high-molecular-weight linear polyethylene even in aqueous emulsion. More important, such novel complexes not only have high activity for olefin polymerization but also can produce functionalized olefins due to their good tolerances to the polar functional groups during polymerization process [1–9]. However, the homogeneous catalysts can easily lead to a giant heat release effect and a serious reactor fouling in the slurry process of olefin polymerization. Thus the application of these catalysts in a continuous process is difficult. In general, the way to solve these problems is to immobilize the catalysts on suitable carriers. Up to now, three methods have been developed for the supporting of late transition metal catalysts [10–20]. The first method involves direct immobilization of the catalyst on the carrier surface, which usually significantly suppresses the catalytic activity, and changes the catalyst structure and the microstructure of the resultant polymer. The second method is the immobilization of the catalyst on the carrier pretreated with MAO or alkylaluminium compounds. It is expected that the carrier and MAO or alkylaluminium compounds are bound by loose ionic interactions. However, this fairly weak bond may lead to the easy departure of catalyst from carrier surface. The third method involves the covalent bonding between the ligand of catalyst and the carrier, which is commonly used in the ethylene polymerization. As a new heterogenization strategy different from the three methods mentioned above, Alt [21] has developed the self-immobilizing metallocene catalysts, which can be used as a comonomer with an olefin or alkyne functional group in the polymerization. More recently, Herrmann [22], Alt [23] and Jin et al. [24] have reported the self-immobilizing Fe and single nuclear neutral Ni catalysts, respectively, for olefin polymerization. However, the self-immobilizing binuclear or multi neutral nickel catalysts were seldom studied. This prompted us to explore the self-immobilizing of binuclear or multi neutral nickel catalysts and study their catalytic behavior for ethylene polymerization so as to obtain polyethylene with high molecular weight. According to Grubbs and his co-workers’ work, the salicylaldimine-based neutral nickel(II) catalysts containing bulky substituents at the ortho position of a phenoxy group (C3) not only shows high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization to produce high-molecular-weight polyethylenes without using cocatalysts, but also can catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and some functionalized olefins. If there is no bulky substituent at the ortho position of the phenoxy group, the catalysts exhibit no activity for ethylene polymerization. Even when (COD)2Ni or B(C6F5)3 was used as a phosphine acceptor, only a low catalytic activity was obtained. This is due to the fact that the introduction of a bulky substituent at the ortho position of the phenoxy group (C3) not only blocks the axial faces of the nickel center and retards the rate of chain termination but also enhances the catalytic activity by accelerating PPh3 dissociation and decreases the rate of catalyst deactivation. Following this strategy, for the self-immobilized neutral catalysts, two important factors must be considered in the design of catalysts: one is introduction of bulky substituents ortho to the phenoxy group (C3) in the salicylaldimine ligand, which favors obtaining high catalytic activity and polyethylene with high molecular weight, and the other is introduction of an active functional group such as allyl in the salicylaldimine ligand, which can simultaneously incorporate into the growing chain of polyethylene during polymerization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a binuclear neutral nickel (II) complex with allyl groups (see Scheme 1 ) as a single-component self-immobilizing catalyst, which exhibit high activities for ethylene polymerization in the absence of cocatalyst and can produce high-molecular-weight branched polymers (see Scheme 2 ). 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures and materials All manipulations of air- and water-sensitive compounds were performed using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were dried by refluxing with appropriate drying agents (sodium/benzophenone for toluene, benzene, diethyl ether, THF, and n-pentane; CaH2 for Methylene dichloride) and distilled under nitrogen prior to use. (COD)2Ni was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received. 4-Allyl-2, 6-diisoproylaniline was prepared according to a previously reported procedure [25]. All the other chemicals were purchased commercially, and used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of the proligands 2.2.1 Synthesis of Compound 4 In accordance with the reported method [24], Compound 4 was prepared from 2,2-biphenol. 1H NMR (500MHz, CDCl3, δ ppm): 7.11 (t, 2H, Ar H), 7.61 (m, 4H, Ar H), 9.88 (s, 2H, CHO), 11.21 (s, 2H, OH).

The autoclave was purged by ethylene three times and then was charged with 60ml of toluene. A solution of the binuclear neutral nickel catalysts was added by a syringe. Next, the autoclave was sealed and pressurized to the desired level, and the polymerization was started by stirring. Finally, the polymerization was terminated by the addition of acidified ethanol. The solid polyethylene was filtered, washed with ethanol, and dried in vacuum oven at 60°C. 2.5 Characterizations The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the ligands and the complex were recorded on a Bruker-500 spectrometer. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data for polyethylene were obtained with a Varian INOVA-500 NMR spectrometer at 130°C using o-dichlorobenzene as the solvent. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded on Bruker Equinox 55 spectrophotometer. Molecular weights (M n and M w ) and molecular weight distributions (MWD) of polyethylene were determined by high-temperature GPC using a Waters GPC-V200 RI detector. The measurements were recorded at 140°C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as a solvent. DSC measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris1 differential scanning calorimeter at a rate of 10°C/min, and the melting temperatures were reported for the second heating cycle. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of proligands and complex The general synthetic route for proligand Compound 4 and binuclear neutral nickel (II) Complex 6 containing ally group were shown in Scheme 1. In accordance with the reported method [26], Compound 4 was readily synthesized in good yield via a three-step reaction using 2,2-biphenol as a starting material. The ligand 5 was synthesized via the condensation reaction of Compound 4 and an excess of 4-allyl-2,6-diisoproylaniline in excellent yield. The deprotonation of ligand 5 was carried out with an excess of NaH in anhydrous THF and the sodium salt of the corresponding ligand was obtained in benzene. Without further purification, the sodium salt of ligand 5 was directly combined with trans-[NiCl(Ph)(PPh3)2] to form the binuclear neutral nickel (II) natalyst with ally groups Complex 6 in good yield. 3.2 Ethylene polymerization behavior of the binuclear neutral nickel (II) catalyst Complex 6 was used as catalyst for ethylene polymerization under 10atm monomer pressure (Scheme 2), the main polymerization data are summarized in Table 1 . We found that Complex 6 can produce high-molecular-weight branching polyethylenes in the absence of cocatalyst (Runs 1–4). This catalytic behavior is similar to those of the nickel-ylide complexes which are effective ethylene oligomerization/polymerization catalysts [27]. As shown in Table 1, the temperature had a dramatic effect on catalyst activity and the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. When temperature increases from 0 to 40°C, the catalyst activity rises from 0.84×105 to 5.23×105 g of PE/(mol of Nih) (Runs 1–3). However, as temperature further increases to 60°C, the activity decreases to 3.64×105 g of PE/(mol of Nih) (Run 4). The GPC results show that the average molecular weights (M w ) of the polyethylenes produced by the self-immobilizing catalyst are in the range of (0.42–0.71)×106 and the values of M w decrease with temperature increment. The M w of the polymer is 0.71×106 as the temperature is 0°C, and it decreases to 0.42×106 as temperature reaches 60°C. The catalytic behavior of Complex 6 was similar to that of the homogeneous catalyst reported by Li [9]. It is possible that, with an increase in temperature, the ethylene concentration in the solution decreases, which leads to decreases in the polymerization rate and molecular weight of the polymer. Moreover, the catalytic system may become unstable when temperature increases, which will also affect the polymerization rate and the molecular weight of the polymer. The effect of cocatalyst (Ni(COD)2) on polymerization behavior of Complex 6 was investigated. Run 5 and Run 6 shown in Table 1 indicate that cocatalyst has an important effect on catalytic behavior. In the absence of cocatalyst, Complex 6 are capable of polymerizing ethylene with a high activity, while using Ni(COD)2 as cocatalyst can further increase the catalytic activity. This is attributed to the strong binding between the phosphine scavenger Ni(COD)2 and PPh3 that makes the abstraction of PPh3 from the Ni center much more easily [28]. Hence, a higher activity can be obtained when Ni(COD)2 is used. As shown in Fig. 1 , the polyethylene samples produced by the self-immobilizing catalyst have broader molecular weight distributions (MWD>2.8) when compare to those obtained from homogeneous non-functionalized single nuclear neutral nickel catalysts reported by Grubbs catalysts (MWD<2.2). Two possible reasons for this phenomenon are: first, as reported by Li [9], Complex 6 is asymmetric in structure. The two Ni units are not identical, which may result in two slightly different active sites during the polymerization. These two different active species can cause the broadening of the molecular weight distribution in comparison to the single nuclear neutral nickel catalyst; second, the molecular weight broadening due to the interaction between catalyst and carrier is a known phenomenon, which leads to the formation of multiactive sites possessing slightly different chain transfer rates [29]. The microstructures of the branched polyethylenes obtained from Complex 6 were analyzed by the high-temperature 13C NMR. The analysis indicates that the polyethylenes contain a few branched chains, and the branched structures are mainly composed of methyl branches. A representative 13C NMR spectrum of polyethylene prepared by Complex 6 at 20°C is shown in Fig. 2 . Based on chemical shift calculations performed by Mandelkern [30], each resonance peak was assigned. According to the literatures [31,32], branches are named by xBn, where B designates a branched chain, n is the length of the branch, x is the carbon number starting with the methyl group of the branch chain and the end methyl noted as n =1. The characteristic chemical shifts at 19.84 (1B1), 32.94 (brB1), 10.92(1B2), 39.46 (brB2), 14.31(1B3), 23.18 (2B4), 37.94 (brB4), 23.32 (2B5), 32.71 (3B n ), and 29.36 (4Bn) ppm manifest that polyethylenes prepared by Complex 6 at 20°C have methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (Pr), butyl (Bu), pentyl (Pe) and long branches (Lg) (n ≥6). Furthermore, the intensity of the peak corresponding to the methyl branch and the nearby carbon chemical shifts at 19.84, 27.48, and 37.21ppm implies that methyl branches predominate in the resulting polyethylene chains. The 13C NMR results of the polyethylene produced by self-immobilizing catalyst are consistent with the results reported by Grubbs and his co-workers [1]. On the other hand, it can be seen that the branching degree of polyethylene increases with the elevating polymerization temperature (Runs 1–4). As reported by Wehrmann [6], the rate of β-hydride transfer will become faster when the temperature is high, which can cause the higher branching degree and lower melting temperature. Especially, as the polymerization temperature is 60°C, no obvious melting temperature of polyethylene can be observed. According to our investigation, the introduction of allyl substituent in the catalyst can prevent the reactor fouling efficiently (Fig. 3 ). This result clearly indicate that the two separate Ni complex units incorporated into polyethylene act as the mutual bulky ortho-substituted steric groups for each other, which aids in inhibiting the chain migration and transfer to some extent and leads to the excellent catalytic performance. We studied the structure of the binuclear neutral nickel catalyst and suggested a possible self-immobilization mechanism in the formation of polyethylene macrochains. We assume that catalytic complex can be incorporated into polyethylene macromolecule by its allyl functional group resulting in the “self-immobilization” of the catalyst. To check this assumption, additional experiments were performed. When a large number of polymers particles appeared in the polymerization system, they were separated and then washed with toluene for three times to re-use as catalysts. We found that the washed catalyst showed high polymerization activities. The results can be attributed to the existence of allyl group in the catalyst precursor. This allyl group can act as an “olefin” and then copolymerized with the ethylene during polymerization to incorporate the Ni catalyst into the polyethylene backbone. Owing to the incorporation of the active centers into the growing chains, the homogenous catalyst was transformed into heterogeneous system with the ability of preventing the reactor fouling. 4 Conclusion In this report, a highly active self-immobilizing single component catalyst based on allyl-functionalized binuclear neutral nickel complex has been studied. The catalyst was anchored on the polymer by incorporation of its allyl functional groups into polyethylene backbone. The tethered complex could be used to polymerize ethylene without using cocatalyst and branched polyethylenes can be obtained. The activities and molecular weight of polyethylene can be adjusted by changing the experimental conditions. The results clearly indicate that our self-immobilized binuclear neutral nickel complexes possess potential as new olefin polymerization catalysts.
