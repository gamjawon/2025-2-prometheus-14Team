TPD and TPSR study of CO interaction with CuO–CeO2 catalysts George Avgouropoulos Theophilos Ioannides ⁎ Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas, Institute of Chemical Engineering and High Temperature Chemical Processes (FORTH/ICE-HT), Stadiou str., PO Box 1414, GR-26504, Patras, Greece ⁎ Corresponding author. Graphical abstract The interaction of CO and CO2 with CuO–CeO2 catalysts has been studied employing the techniques of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR). Catalytic sites, which form strongly bound carbonates during interaction with CO, get eliminated with increase of activation temperature and do not contribute to the steady-state activity. Ceria is related with the stabilization of highly dispersed copper species and creation of additional sites for CO adsorption and reaction. The interaction of CO and CO2 with CuO–CeO2 catalysts, prepared by a citrate-hydrothermal method, has been studied employing the techniques of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of preadsorbed CO, as well as TPD of preadsorbed CO2. The effect of copper content and activation temperature on the adsorptive behavior of the catalysts has been investigated. TPD studies of preadsorbed CO showed that a small fraction of CO is reversibly adsorbed, while most of it undergoes reaction with surface oxygen and desorbs as CO2. Such profiles of CO2 consist of a peak at 100–120°C along with CO2 desorption at high temperatures, which was significant for catalysts activated at 300°C. TPSR of preadsorbed CO showed that reversibly adsorbed CO is highly reactive in the presence of gaseous oxygen. Catalytic sites, which form carbonates during interaction with CO, get eliminated with increase of catalyst activation temperature and do not contribute to the steady-state activity of the catalysts. The effect of CeO2 appears to be mainly related to stabilization of highly dispersed copper oxide species and to creation of additional sites for CO adsorption and reaction, probably at the interface between the two oxides. Keywords CO Adsorption TPD Ceria Copper oxide 1 Introduction The CuO–CeO2 catalytic system has been studied by a large number of investigators in view of its application in (preferential) CO oxidation and many techniques have been employed for its characterization [1–34]. These include N2O chemisorption, TPR, SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, EPR and FTIR spectroscopy. On the other hand, temperature-programmed techniques, such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), have been less often used to study the characteristics of CO adsorption on CuO–CeO2. CO-TPD experiments over CuO–CeO2 catalysts with CuO content up to 15wt.% prepared by impregnation have been carried out by Luo et al. [14]. They found that almost no CO is desorbing from the catalysts and the TPD profile consists of a single CO2 peak at 110°C. Martinez-Arias et al. [4] have carried out CO-TPD for a 1wt.% CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation and activated at 500°C. The reported TPD profiles consist of a small CO peak at 70–80°C and a CO2 peak at 110°C with a tail extending up to 450°C. Similar desorption behavior has been reported recently by Caputo et al. [33] during CO-TPD over a 4wt.% CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation. We have also reported on the adsorption and reaction of CO on combustion-synthesized CuO–CeO2 catalysts [32]. Adsorption of CO was found to proceed through initial reduction of Cu2+ and formation of carbonate species followed by adsorption of CO on reduced Cu+ sites. In the present work, we examine the interaction of CO with CuO–CeO2 materials, prepared via a citrate-hydrothermal method, employing the techniques of TPD and TPSR of preadsorbed CO. TPD experiments of preadsorbed CO2 were also carried out, as CO2 is the reaction product between CO and O2. The effect of copper content and activation temperature on the adsorptive behavior of the catalysts has been investigated. Physicochemical characterization and activity data in preferential CO oxidation of these catalysts have been reported in a previous publication [1]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts CuO–CeO2 samples were prepared via a citrate-hydrothermal method [1]. Aqueous solutions of metal acetates – cerium acetate [Ce(C2H3O2)3·1.5H2O] and copper acetate [Cu(C2H3O2)2·H2O] – were mixed with an aqueous solution of citric acid under continuous stirring. The molar ratios of citric acid to each metal acetate were adjusted as citric acid/Ce=1/1 and citric acid/Cu=2/3. The mixed solution was treated hydrothermally in a stainless steel autoclave, at 150°C (heating rate=2°Cmin−1) for 24h. Following hydrothermal treatment, the autoclave was opened, excess water was decanted and the remaining paste was dried for 12h at 120°C and subsequently activated at 300, 400 or 500°C under a flowing 20% O2/He mixture (20cm3 min−1) for 2h. For comparison purposes, two additional catalysts, namely 7.5wt.% CuO/CeO2 and 7.5wt.% CuO/Al2O3, were prepared by impregnation using an aqueous Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution of the desired concentration. The supports in this case were CeO2 made via the hydrothermal-citrate method (S BET =27.6m2 g−1) and commercial Al2O3 (Alfa-Aesar, S BET =90m2 g−1). The samples were dried overnight in an oven at 120°C and then activated at 400°C under a flowing 20% O2/He mixture (20cm3 min−1) for 2h. All samples were sieved to obtain the desired fraction of particle diameter between 90 and 180μm. For ease of reference, the catalysts are encoded as follows: xCu-TTT, where x is the Cu/(Cu+Ce) atomic ratio and TTT is the activation temperature. For example, the catalyst 0.25Cu-400 was prepared at a ratio of Cu/(Cu+Ce)=0.25 and was activated at 400°C. 2.2 Temperature-programmed techniques (CO-TPD, CO2-TPD and TPSR) TPD and TPSR experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor system, described in detail elsewhere [5]. Prior to TPD, the catalyst (30–50mg with particle size 90μm< d p <180μm) was treated at its activation temperature for 30min under a 20% O2/He flow (20cm3 min−1), and cooled under the same gas flow to 32°C. After purging with He, adsorption of CO (CO-TPD and TPSR) or CO2 (CO2-TPD) was carried out under a flow of 1% CO/He or 1.7% CO2/He mixture, respectively. Following completion of the adsorption, as indicated by stable signals of CO or CO2 in the mass spectrometer, the reactor was purged with pure He for ∼10min. Then, the TPD or TPSR run was started under a flow of 40cm3 min−1 of He (CO-TPD and CO2-TPD) or 1% O2/He (TPSR-O2) with a heating rate of 20°Cmin−1 up to the corresponding activation temperature for each catalyst. This was followed by soak at this temperature until the MS signals returned to baseline levels. A mass spectrometer (Omnistar/Pfeiffer Vacuum) was used for on-line monitoring of effluent gases. Mass peaks of CO, CO2, O2, H2 and H2O were monitored during the experiments. The only products detected, in all cases, were CO and CO2. CO (m/z 28) and CO2 (m/z 44) signals were calibrated using gas mixtures prepared in situ and analyzed in a pre-calibrated gas chromatograph with a TC detector (Shimadzu 14B). The contribution of CO2 to the m/z 28 signal was taken into account for the calculation of CO concentration. 3 Results 3.1 TPD of CO and CO2 As stated in Section 2, the maximum temperature during TPD was the same as the corresponding activation temperature of the catalyst tested in the specific run. In the case of catalysts activated at 300°C, for example, the TPD run consisted of a ramp of 20°Cmin−1 to 300°C, followed by soak at this temperature, until the signals returned to baseline levels. Typical TPD profiles along with the applied temperature program after CO adsorption at RT are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) for 0.50Cu–300 and 0.50Cu–400 catalysts, respectively. The majority of adsorbed CO desorbs as CO2, but there is also molecular desorption of CO at low temperatures with a peak at 75°C. CO desorption starts immediately upon initiation of the temperature ramp. The CO2 profiles are characterized by a main peak at ∼110°C and a second peak above 300°C, which is more intense for the 0.50Cu-300 sample. The effect of catalyst Cu content on the resulting TPD profiles of CO2 following CO adsorption is depicted in Fig. 2(a)–(c) for catalysts activated at 300, 400 and 500°C, respectively. The corresponding profiles of CuO and CeO2 are also shown for comparison purposes. CO desorption profiles were similar in all cases to those shown in Fig. 1 and are not plotted for reasons of clarity. In the case of CeO2, very small amounts of CO2 and no CO were detected during TPD, with CO2 appearing above 225°C and slightly increasing with temperature. The CO2 profile of pure CuO consisted of a small peak at ∼100°C with a tail extending up to 300°C. Regarding CuO–CeO2 catalysts, the profiles of 0.25Cu, 0.50Cu and 0.75Cu bear many similarities, while the behavior of 0.10Cu is significantly different: CO2 desorption from the 0.10Cu-300 sample starts above 130°C giving a broad peak at 200–250°C compared to a peak at 120°C for all other catalysts activated at 300°C (Fig. 2(a)). The CO2 profiles of catalysts activated at 400°C (Fig. 2(b)) also indicate a gradual shift of the CO2 peak to lower temperatures accompanied by an increase in the amount of desorbed CO2 with increase of Cu content. When the activation temperature is 500°C (Fig. 2(c)), the high-temperature CO2 peak has diminished and the profiles are characterized by a peak at 100°C (150°C for 0.10Cu). Increase of catalyst activation temperature leads to a decrease of the amount of CO2 desorbing from the catalysts. The high-temperature (HT) CO2 desorption peak diminishes with increase of catalyst activation temperature: it is quite significant for the samples activated at 300°C, but has essentially disappeared for catalysts activated at 500°C. In addition, the intensity of the low-temperature (LT) CO2 peak decreases by half. A small shift of the CO2 peak temperature from 110–120 to 100°C is also observed with increase of the catalyst activation temperature. The quantities of desorbed CO2 and CO (in μmolg−1) and the specific adsorption capacity (in μmolm−2) of the catalysts following adsorption of CO at RT are presented in Table 1 (calculation of specific adsorption capacities employed the specific surface areas, S BET, of all catalysts, which are given in Table 2 ). The quantity of desorbed CO is 5–15% of the total (CO+CO2) amount desorbed from the catalysts and there appears no definite trend with Cu content or activation temperature. The quantity of desorbed CO2 is up to one order of magnitude higher in Cu–Ce catalysts compared to pure CuO and increases with increase of Cu content of the catalysts. On the other hand, the quantity of desorbed CO2 decreases by 3–4 times with increase of catalyst activation temperature from 300 to 500°C. The specific adsorption capacity of Cu–Ce catalysts is larger than the one of pure CuO and pure CeO2 and it tends to increase with: (i) increase of copper loading and (ii) decrease of activation temperature. The CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation has similar specific adsorption capacity to the 0.15Cu catalyst, while the CuO/Al2O3 sample shows the lowest capacity among all catalysts. By comparison, the quantity of desorbed CO2 and CO for a 0.15Cu catalyst, prepared by combustion, was 131.2μmolg−1 [32] and its corresponding specific capacity is 3.36μmolm−2. These values are quite similar to the ones presented in Table 1 for catalysts prepared by the citrate method. TPD experiments following adsorption of CO2 at RT were also carried out. Adsorption of CO2 is interesting from the fact that CO2 acts as an inhibitor of CO oxidation [1,5,6,15]. The TPD profiles of CO2 after its adsorption at RT are shown in Fig. 3 for CuO–CeO2 catalysts, as well as for pure CuO and CeO2. In the case of pure CuO, CO2 desorption took place in the form of a peak at 100°C with a tail up to 300°C. For pure CeO2, the CO2 profile consisted of a LT main peak at 85°C and a second – lower in intensity – peak at 250°C. In the case of CuO–CeO2 catalysts, a main CO2 peak at 90°C was found with a tail up to 300–400°C. The high-temperature CO2 desorption is most significant at low-copper loadings (0.10Cu) and gradually weakens with increase of copper loading. The desorbed quantity of CO2 expressed in μmolg−1 and the specific CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalysts (μmolm−2) are presented in Table 3 . Similarly to the case of CO adsorption, the specific CO2 adsorption capacity decreases with increase of catalyst activation temperature. On the other hand, the specific capacity of CuO–CeO2 catalysts attains intermediate values between those for pure CuO and pure CeO2. Hence, it is quite probable that CO2 adsorption on CuO–CeO2 catalysts takes place on both CuO and CeO2 moieties. In addition, the amounts of adsorbed CO2 are considerably smaller than the amounts of adsorbed CO, as deduced from comparison of the results in Tables 1 and 3. The relative amounts of COads/CO2ads appear also to increase with increase of T act. 3.2 TPSR of adsorbed CO with O2 In TPSR experiments, the temperature ramp following adsorption of CO at RT was carried out using an O2/He mixture as the carrier gas. No CO was found to desorb in this case, in contrast to what was found during TPD. Therefore, reversibly adsorbed CO gets oxidized in the presence of gas phase oxygen. The only product detected in the gas phase was CO2 and the corresponding TPSR profiles of CO2 from 0.25Cu catalysts activated at 300, 400 and 500°C are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be observed that the reactivity of preadsorbed CO increases with increase of activation temperature from 300 to 400°C, as indicated from the shift of peak temperature from 120 to 70°C. Further increase of T act from 400 to 500°C leads to decrease of the amount of desorbed CO2 (as in the case of TPD of preadsorbed CO), but the shapes of both profiles are similar in all respects. The TPSR profiles of CO2 from CuO–CeO2 catalysts of varying Cu content activated at 400°C, as well as of pure CuO, are shown in Fig. 5 . Compared to TPD, the peak temperatures of CO2 over CuO–CeO2 catalysts are shifted to lower temperatures in the presence of gas phase O2. In the case of 0.10Cu, for example, the observed shift is from 220 to 120°C, while for 0.50Cu the corresponding shift is from 110 to 70°C. In contrast, there is no appreciable shift in the case of pure CuO. All profiles are rather broad showing a tail extending up to 400°C. In order to be able to compare more clearly the effect of gas phase O2 on the reactivity of adsorbed CO, the TPD and TPSR profiles from the 0.15Cu–400, 7.5wt.% CuO/CeO2 and 7.5wt.% CuO/Al2O3 catalysts are compared in Figs. 6(a)–(c), respectively. It can be observed that the CO2 profile during TPSR is essentially the sum of CO and CO2 TPD profiles, i.e. species, which desorb as CO in the absence of oxygen, appear as CO2 in the presence of oxygen. There is not any significant difference in the shape and position of TPSR profiles of 0.15Cu-400, 7.5wt.% CuO/CeO2 and 7.5wt.% CuO/Al2O3 catalysts, but only in the amount of produced CO2, which is considerably smaller over the alumina-supported catalyst. The amounts of CO2 produced during TPSR were, in all cases, almost equal to the sum of (CO+CO2) produced during TPD of preadsorbed CO. This result, therefore, helps validate and confirm the corresponding TPD results. 4 Discussion The observation of molecular desorption of CO during TPD implies that part of CO adsorbs reversibly on all catalysts when the adsorption is carried out at RT. This is in line to what has been found previously by us [32], as well as other investigators [4]. Reversibly adsorbed CO is obviously bound on a reduced Cu1+ site, which has been created during exposure of the catalysts to CO prior to TPD or TPSR. FTIR studies of adsorbed CO over CuO–CeO2 indicate formation of Cu+ carbonyls due to interaction of CO with Cu2+ ions with unsaturated coordination leading to their reduction with accompanying CO2 formation, while subsequent CO adsorption on reduced centers produces the Cu+-carbonyl species [24]. Microcalorimetric studies of CO interaction with CuO–ZnO catalysts in the oxidized state have shown the occurrence of surface reduction by CO as indicated by the high heat of interaction, while the heat of adsorption of CO on the resulting Cu+ centers takes values in the range of 110–66kJmol−1 [35]. Our TPD and TPSR results are in agreement with such a scheme of CO adsorption. The Cu+–CO species are very reactive in the presence of gaseous oxygen, which is rapidly taken up by the reduced catalyst surface even at room temperature, as has been found by Caputo et al. [33]. Regarding CO2 adsorption, CO2-TPD experiments showed that CO2 desorption takes place with peak at around 100°C. It is expected, therefore, that the surface coverage of CO2 will become quite low at temperatures around 150°C or higher. This is in line with the observed inhibition effect of CO2 during CO oxidation under steady-state conditions [1]. The observation that CO2 inhibition is stronger over pure CuO than on CuO–CeO2 catalysts may be attributed to: (i) the stronger adsorption of CO2 on pure CuO compared to CuO–CeO2 catalysts, as indicated by the higher CO2 peak temperature in the former case and (ii) the higher value of the ratio COads/CO2ads on CuO–CeO2 catalysts compared to pure CuO, indicating that CO2 occupies a larger fraction of active sites on pure CuO, causing in this way a stronger inhibition. 4.1 Effect of Cu content on CO-TPD In the case of pure CeO2, CO2 started to form above 225°C and its formation rate increased gradually with temperature, but the amount of CO2 produced was very low compared to CuO–CeO2 catalysts. This result shows, however, that these small amounts of CO are held quite strongly on the CeO2 surface, probably via formation of carbonate species. The total amount of (CO+CO2), which is produced during TPD from CuO–CeO2 catalysts does not increase in an analogous fashion with increase of Cu content. When the catalyst activation temperature is 300°C, the total amount of (CO+CO2) is in the range of 270–335μmolg−1. At the activation temperature of 400°C, increase of Cu content from 0.10 to 0.75 leads to doubling of desorbed amount from 120 to ∼230μmolg−1, while at T act =500°C the corresponding increase is ∼50%, i.e. from 85 to 127μmolg−1. This means that most of the added copper oxide does not contribute appreciably to the creation of sites for CO adsorption. Caputo et al. [33] have measured the quantity of adsorbed CO over a 4wt.% CuO/CeO2 catalyst to be 163μmolg−1 corresponding to a specific capacity of 3.26μmolm−2. Jung et al. [34] have measured the irreversible CO uptake of a CuO–CeO2 (5.1wt.% Cu) catalyst at RT with a static method. They found a value of ∼446μmolg−1 for the catalyst activated at 500°C (S BET =78m2 g−1) and a value of ∼125μmolg−1 for the catalyst activated at 700°C (S BET =22m2 g−1), which was the most active one. It should be noted that these measurements were obtained with higher CO pressure (500mm Hg) than that of the present work. TPD profiles in Fig. 2 show that the CO2 peak temperatures shift to lower values with increase of copper content, while the 0.10Cu catalyst shows a significant delay in the appearance of CO2 in the gas phase compared to the other catalysts. When this catalyst was activated at 300°C, the total amounts of CO and CO2 desorbed after CO adsorption were ∼300μmolg−1. The CuO loading of this catalyst is 615μmolg−1 and the corresponding CO/Cu ratio is 0.5. This result indicates the presence of highly dispersed, isolated Cu2+ species on the surface. Increase of activation temperature to 400 or 500°C causes a marked decrease in the amount of desorbed CO and CO2 by 3–4 times to 120 and 85μmolg−1, respectively, implying a loss of adsorption sites due to agglomeration of copper ions with formation of very small CuO clusters. At the same time, TPD profiles showed a shift of CO2 desorption to lower temperatures – hence easier decomposition of formed carbonates – with increase of T act. Under steady-state CO oxidation conditions, the 0.10Cu catalyst had slightly higher activity when activated at 400 or 500°C than at 300°C [1], showing that the “lost” adsorption sites do not actually contribute to the catalyst activity. The same applies for the catalysts with Cu content of 0.15 and 0.25. 4.2 Effect of activation temperature of catalysts on CO-TPD Significant amounts of CO2 desorbing at high temperature were found over the catalysts activated at 300°C. These were considerably diminished for catalysts activated at 400°C and had almost disappeared, when T act was 500°C. A similar feature in CO-TPD over CuO–CeO2 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation has been reported by Zou et al. [36] and may be attributed to decomposition of carbonate species formed upon reaction of adsorbed CO with surface oxygen. This explanation assumes that carbon dioxide formed on the surface is bound in a different mode compared to carbon dioxide adsorbed from the gas phase, because no high-temperature CO2 peak was observed during CO2-TPD. The main difference between CO2 formed on the surface by reaction of adsorbed CO with surface oxygen and CO2 adsorbed from the gas phase is that the former resides on a locally reduced surface due to abstraction of lattice oxygen. Formation of carbonates, carboxylates and linear adsorbed CO with exposure of CeO2 to CO at room temperature has been previously reported [37,38]. Hilaire et al. [39] have also found that carbonate species are formed upon exposure of a Pd/CeO2 catalyst to CO at 400°C. These carbonate species were found to be quite stable on a reduced ceria surface, but decomposed with exposure in oxygen. Karpenco et al. [40] have also reported fast decomposition of carbonate species during oxidative treatment (O2/N2) at 180°C of Au/CeO2 catalysts. These carbonate species are generally associated with reduced sites (Ce3+) and the oxidative treatment causes their decomposition with simultaneous oxidation of the ceria surface (Ce3+ →Ce4+). Comparison of TPD and TPSR profiles for the catalysts activated at 400°C shows that CO2 desorption is completed earlier during TPSR, as the CO2 peak observed at 400°C during TPD is absent in TPSR. This is in line with a greater instability of carbonates (thus larger tendency towards decomposition) in the presence of O2. It should be pointed out that the disappearance of the high-temperature CO2 peak with increase of catalyst activation temperature has almost no effect on catalyst activity, because catalysts activated at 500°C – for which this peak is not present – have comparable activities with catalysts activated at 300°C [32]. CuO–CeO2 catalysts exhibit activity in CO oxidation even at 50°C, whereas at this temperature the species responsible for the HT CO2 desorption will certainly be spectator species. The low-temperature peak of CO2 observed during TPD of preadsorbed CO was found to decrease by ∼50% with increase of T act from 300 to 500°C, i.e. in an analogous fashion to the concomitant decrease of the surface area of the catalysts. Therefore, as far as the LT CO2 peak is concerned, no significant change in the amount of the corresponding adsorbed CO per unit surface area of the catalyst takes place. The overall decrease in the amount of adsorbed CO per m2 of catalyst with increase in T act is due to the disappearance of the HT CO2 peak. The shift of the CO2 peak temperature from 120 to 100°C with increase of T act can be considered as an indication of enhancement of catalyst reactivity, because surface carbonates are less stable and tend to decompose at lower temperatures. 4.3 Adsorption sites and catalytic activity Quantitative analysis of TPD and TPSR experiments has provided an estimation of the active sites of CuO–CeO2 catalysts, i.e. of sites which are able to interact with CO at room temperature. The results of this analysis and the derived conclusions may be summarized as follows: • Interaction of CO with all catalysts has identical features: (i) reactive adsorption leading to surface reduction and bound carbonates and (ii) adsorption of CO on reduced sites: this adsorption is weak and reversible. This type of adsorbed CO is highly reactive towards gaseous oxygen. • Highly dispersed Cu2+ species (essentially isolated Cu2+) which are more abundant on CuO–CeO2 catalysts activated at low temperature, which possess a high surface area, get reduced by interaction with CO and form surface carbonates. • Increase of catalyst activation temperature leads to CuO cluster growth and diminishes the HT CO2 desorption feature. The CO adsorption capacity and the catalytic activity in CO oxidation of all catalysts, is compared in Table 4 , which depicts the adsorption ratio, Q/Q CuO (Q is the sum of (CO+CO2) desorbed during TPD expressed in μ mol g CuO − 1 and Q CuO is the corresponding value for pure CuO) and the activity ratio, R/R CuO (R is the CO oxidation rate expressed in μ mol s − 1 g CuO − 1 and R CuO the corresponding reaction rate for pure CuO). As the adsorption ratio, Q/Q CuO, compares the amount of CO adsorbed on the catalysts to that on pure CuO based on the same CuO mass, it provides an indication of the effect of the support (CeO2 or Al2O3) on enhancing CuO dispersion and creating additional adsorption sites. The activity ratio, R/R CuO, operates in an analogous fashion regarding catalytic activity. For example, 1g of CuO contained in the 0.10Cu-300 catalyst adsorbs 183 times more CO and is 54 times more active in CO oxidation than pure CuO. The results of Table 4 show that the adsorption ratio decreases both with increase of copper content and with increase of activation temperature. This corresponds to a decrease of CuO dispersion due to diminishing of atomically dispersed copper ions and CuO cluster growth. The 7.5wt.% CuO/CeO2 catalyst, prepared by impregnation, has a smaller adsorption and activity ratio than the corresponding 0.15Cu–400 catalyst of the same CuO content, obviously due to its smaller surface area and the different preparation method. The 7.5wt.% CuO/Al2O3 catalyst has the smallest adsorption ratio among all catalysts. The activity ratio decreases with increase of copper content in a fashion analogous to the adsorption ratio, but decreases with increase of activation temperature only for catalysts with high copper content (0.50Cu and 0.75Cu). In the case of catalysts with low copper content (0.10Cu–0.25Cu), the activity ratio shows a weak maximum at the activation temperature of 400°C. A similar example can be derived from the work of Jung et al. [34], in which it is shown that the catalytic activities of a 5.1wt.% CuO–CeO2 catalyst prepared by co-precipitation and calcined at 500°C or 900°C are comparable, despite the fact that the surface area is more than 6 times lower and the CO uptake 14 times lower for the catalyst calcined at 900°C. The observed trends of adsorption and activity ratios for our catalysts lead to the conclusion that the “lost” adsorption sites do not contribute to catalyst activity. On the basis of TPD results, these sites are most probably blocked by carbonate species under steady-state reaction conditions. DRIFTS experiments under PROX reaction conditions have shown the formation of different carbonate species on CuO–CeO2 catalysts, located at the interfacial region of the support in contact with the dispersed copper oxide species [18]. Another interesting observation regarding the data in Table 4 is that the values of the adsorption and activity ratios for most catalysts are quite similar (exceptions are the 0.10Cu-300 and 0.75Cu). This implies that the enhanced CO oxidation activity of CuO–CeO2 catalysts compared to CuO is in a major part due to their higher active site density and not to a higher intrinsic site activity. If one calculates the Q/Q CuO ratio on a surface area basis, it turns out that it obtains values in the range of 1.2–3.5, hence CuO–CeO2 catalysts have a density of sites for CO adsorption 1.2–3.5 times higher than the one of pure CuO. These additional sites for CO adsorption and reaction reside probably at the interface between the two oxides. 5 Conclusions The interaction of CO with CuO–CeO2, CuO and CuO/Al2O3 catalysts can be described as a reactive adsorption leading to surface reduction and formation of carbonates and concomitant reversible adsorption of CO on reduced sites (Cu+). Reversibly adsorbed CO is weakly bound and desorbs with peak below 100°C, but is highly reactive towards gaseous oxygen. Surface carbonates, formed by the interaction of CO with the catalysts at room temperature, decompose during TPD towards CO2. The corresponding CO2 profiles consist of a LT peak at 100–150°C – common on all catalysts – along with CO2 desorption at high temperatures in the case of CuO–CeO2 catalysts activated at low temperature. Increase of catalyst activation temperature leads to CuO cluster growth and decrease of CO adsorption capacity, but this is not detrimental to catalyst activity, because the ‘lost’ sites are those which bind carbonate species and are inactive under reaction conditions. The beneficial effect of CeO2 on the activity of CuO–CeO2 catalysts may be attributed to the stabilization of highly dispersed CuO species with concomitant creation of additional CO adsorption and reaction sites, probably at the interface between the two oxides.

        "dc:description": "The interaction of CO and CO2 with CuO–CeO2 catalysts, prepared by a citrate-hydrothermal method, has been studied employing the techniques of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of preadsorbed CO, as well as TPD of preadsorbed CO2. The effect of copper content and activation temperature on the adsorptive behavior of the catalysts has been investigated. TPD studies of preadsorbed CO showed that a small fraction of CO is reversibly adsorbed, while most of it undergoes reaction with surface oxygen and desorbs as CO2. Such profiles of CO2 consist of a peak at 100–120°C along with CO2 desorption at high temperatures, which was significant for catalysts activated at 300°C. TPSR of preadsorbed CO showed that reversibly adsorbed CO is highly reactive in the presence of gaseous oxygen. Catalytic sites, which form carbonates during interaction with CO, get eliminated with increase of catalyst activation temperature and do not contribute to the steady-state activity of the catalysts. The effect of CeO2 appears to be mainly related to stabilization of highly dispersed copper oxide species and to creation of additional sites for CO adsorption and reaction, probably at the interface between the two oxides.",
