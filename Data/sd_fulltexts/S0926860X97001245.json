On the basis of the TAP system, an alternative to the traditional kinetic approach in heterogeneous catalysis is developed. This new approach, termed 'interrogative kinetics' involves a combination of two types of kinetic experiments called 'state-defining' (friendly) and 'state-altering' (typical) experiments.

The theory of TAP pulse response experiments is developed. Two deterministic models based on partial-differential equations are analyzed for the cases of diffusion, irreversible adsorption/reaction and reversible adsorption. The 'standard diffusion curve' that can be used for distinguishing the Knudsen flow regime is described, and simple criteria of the Knudsen regime are proposed. The concept of relative flow is described, and different fingerprints of TAP kinetics for irreversible adsorption/reaction and reversible adsorption are presented.

Introduction Two general approaches, namely the 'practical catalyst' approach and the 'model catalyst' approach, are used in heterogeneous catalysis research. The 'practical catalyst' approach involves the systematic synthesis, testing and characterization of numerous catalyst samples, and is the basis for most industrial catalyst development. Reaction studies, used to measure catalyst performance and obtain kinetic para- *Corresponding author.

Bulk catalyst characterization techniques such as XRD, MR, etc. along with various physical measurements (i.e., surface areas, etc.) are used to characterize the bulk structure of practical catalysts. Industrial catalytic materials include supported metals, mixed metal oxides, and zeolites. Practical catalyst research has spurred the development of a variety of catalytic reactor systems, and a number of special reactors have been developed to obtain steady-state kinetics. Kinetic parameters are obtained from steady-state data by applying steady- 56 J. T. Cleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 state reaction theory. These parameters are used extensively in the development of industrial catalytic processes, and to construct kinetic models of catalytic reactions. Although steady-state studies provide essential performance data for catalyst development, the apparent kinetics obtained from steady-state studies do not provide a detailed understanding of fundamental catalytic processes. In recent years nonsteadystate techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), temperature programmed reaction (TPR), isotopic switching, or pulse response experiments, have been developed to augment steady-state experiments. These techniques can provided a more detailed understanding of fundamental surface processes, but no detailed theory has been developed to obtain kinetic parameters from transient techniques. Currently, most `practical catalyst' development programs rely primarily on the application of traditional kinetic studies and structural analysis. The `model catalyst' approach has been used principally to investigate fundamental catalytic processes on well defined surfaces. Ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques (AES, XPS, LEED, SIMS, etc.) are employed to characterize the catalytic surfaces at an atomic level, and reaction studies are carried out using thermal desorption spectroscopy TDS or molecular beam scattering experiments. One of the goals of the `model catalyst' approach is to obtain fundamental information on a variety of catalytic reactions which in turn can be used to guide the development of practical catalytic materials. However, correlating model catalyst research with practical catalyst research has not been straightforward, since there exists a significant `gap' between most `real world' catalytic processes, and the model reaction studies carried out in surface science systems. Practical catalytic reactions are generally performed at pressures at or above one atmosphere, whereas most surface analysis can be performed only in ultrahigh vacuum. This `gap' was first discussed by Bonzel [1] who coined the term `pressure gap'. In addition to being separated by a `pressure gap', practical and model catalyst studies are also separated by an even more significant `materials gap' that arises because of differences in the catalytic properties of practical and model catalysts. The `materials gap' is part of the larger chemical problem of how to correlate chemical structure with chemical activity. The `pressure-materials gap' issue has stimulated considerable discussion within the catalysis community, and a significant point of debate is whether results obtained on model catalysts at ultrahigh vacuum conditions can be extrapolated to real materials operating at higher pressures. In recent years, a number of approaches have been developed to overcome the `pressure-materials' gap. From the practical side, sophisticated surface science techniques have been adapted to study practical catalytic materials, and some progress has been made in characterizing the surface structure of real catalysts. From the other side, techniques that combine kinetic measurements on model catalysts at ambient pressures with pre- and post-reaction surface analysis have been used to investigate model reactions on model surfaces. These mutual efforts are ongoing, and it is anticipated that they will yield important new results. Notwithstanding significant progress in understanding many fundamental processes occurring in model catalytic systems, practical catalyst development is still a slow painstaking process hampered by a lack of fundamental information on the composition and structure of the catalytic phase or catalytic site. The surface of a practical catalyst is likely to be compositionally different from the bulk, structurally and compositionally nonuniform, and may change during the course of a catalytic reaction. As a result, information gleaned from determining the bulk crystal structure of a catalyst is of limited value in characterizing a catalyst surface. The chemical properties of a surface may also be strongly influenced by various adspecies which in turn may change during the course of a reaction. Adspecies, reaction intermediates, and adsorbed reaction products often have short surface lifetimes, and may exist in low concentration on the surface. As a result, they are difficult to detect and characterize under reaction conditions. Also, the catalytic sites on a practical catalyst may occupy only a small portion of the total catalyst surface making their identification difficult even with surface sensitive techniques. These factors pose serious obstacles to the direct observation and characterization of catalytic sites, and as a result it is difficult to develop detailed structure-activity correlations on practical catalysts. An alternative to the classic kinetic approach used in catalyst development, is a new approach that we have termed `interrogative kinetics' (IK). In contrast J.T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 to traditional steady-state kinetics which attempts to obtain kinetic parameters for a well determined 'steady-state' of the catalyst surface, interrogative kinetics attempts to systematically probe a variety of different states of the catalyst surface, and to understand how one state evolves into another. An important element of this approach is the rapid feedback between experiment and analysis that can be likened to a 'dialogue' between the researcher and the catalyst sample. The set of experiments that form an IK sequence represents a 'question' (e.g., how does a change in the oxidation state of a catalyst change its selectivity, or the activation energy of hydrocarbon conversion) that when answered leads to another question, and another IK sequence. Interrogative kinetics involves two types of experiments that are performed in sequence to reveal complex mechanisms and structure-activity relationships. The first type is a 'state-defining' (friendly) experiment that does not significantly perturb the kinetic state of the catalyst, but provides information that can characterize the state. The second type is a 'statealtering' (typical) experiment that perturbs the catalyst and changes its composition or structure in some predetermined fashion. To complete the sequence another state-defining experiment is performed to characterize the new state of the catalyst. State-defining experiments involve reactions of probe molecules with a catalyst, and provide kinetic parameters such as rate parameters of adsorption and desorption to characterize the reactions. One example of a 'probe reaction' is the irreversible chemisorption of a hydrocarbon on a metal oxide catalyst. In this case, the state-defining kinetic parameter of the reaction is the rate parameter of irreversible chemisorption, or the rate of irreversible chemisorption at unitary gas concentration. This parameter is state-defining because it depends on the kinetic state of the metal oxide surface. In particular, it depends on the concentration and reactivity of the surface species on which the hydrocarbon chemisorbs. Interrogative kinetics is based on the application of novel high speed transient response experiments (TAP pulse response experiments) [2,3] in conjunction with traditional kinetic measurements (steady-state, TPD, step-transient, etc.). IK uses a battery of kinetic measurements to probe the kinetic characteristics of a catalytic surface, and to monitor how these character- 57 istics change in response to changing reaction conditions (pressure, temperature, surface coverage, reactant composition, etc.). From the kinetic characteristics derived from multiple experiments performed on a single catalyst sample feature of the structure of the catalytic site can be extracted. Interrogative kinetics uses kinetic interactions between probe molecules and the catalyst surface to construct plausible models of the catalytic site. TAP pulse response experiments are essential for performing 'state-defining' experiments at a constant kinetic state of a catalyst, for distinguishing the details of complex surface transformations, and developing an understanding of the hierarchy of times of surface processes. TAP experiments can be performed on practical and model catalyst, and provide a method of bridging the 'pressure-materials' gap. Another important aspect of interrogative kinetics is the special theoretical analysis of kinetic data. The theory must provide the tools and methodology for rapid primary interpretation of kinetic data, distinguishing of different mechanisms and kinetic cases, and fast extraction of kinetic parameters. Of particular interest is the analysis of data from state defining experiments. Examples will be given in this paper for diffusion, irreversible adsorption/reaction and reversible desorption. The TAP reactor system was originally created to assist the catalyst development process, and is proving to be a powerful tool for unraveling complex catalytic reactions, and other surface processes 13-12]. Recently, we have developed a new experimental apparatus, called a TAP-2 reactor system that significantly extends the capabilities of the TAP experiment. The goal of this paper is to describe the key features of the TAP-2 reactor system that distinguish it from the previous TAP system, to further develop the theoretical foundation of TAP pulse response experiments, to experimentally verify the correct operation of the TAP-2 detection system, and to provide an example of how the TAP-2 system is applied using the methodology of 'interrogative kinetics'. 2. The TAP experiment and TAP reactor systems Transient response experiments can provide a much richer information yield than steady-state experi- 58 J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 997) 55-88 ments. Transient response data is the evolved response from a series of transport-kinetic interactions, and contains information about individual steps in a catalytic process. The information is historical in nature, and a key concern is whether the catalytic system is substantially in the same state (i.e., the average structural and kinetic properties are the same) after the measurement as it was before the measurement. In conventional heterogeneous transient kinetic studies, in which a relatively large number of molecules are required for a measurement, the nature of the catalyst (e.g., oxidation state, phase structure, activity, selectivity, etc.) can change as a result of reactions between the catalyst and the gas phase reactants. The kinetic information is obtained from measurements of gas phase concentrations, and the sensitivity of these measurements is limited by the ability to measure changes in concentration. Thus a major drawback of conventional transient response experiments is the severity of the perturbation to the catalytic system caused by the transient input. Under these conditions it is very difficult to control the state of the catalyst surface and bulk, and to achieve reproducible results. Although transient experiments have the potential to give significantly more information than steady-state experiments, they are not as commonly performed. One of the most important features that distinguishes TAP reactor systems from other kinetic installations is the TAP pulse response experiment. This experiment is a unique type of transient response experiment performed by injecting a narrow gas pulse into an evacuated microreactor. TAP pulse response experiments involve a very small number of molecules in comparison to conventional transient response experiments. In a TAP pulse response experiment the injected gas molecules as well as any product molecules formed by chemical reactions are transported through the reactor by Knudsen diffusion. An important characteristic of the Knudsen flow regime is that the diffusivities of the individual components of a gas mixture are independent of the gas composition of the mixture. TAP pulse response experiments use a different experimental strategy to extract kinetic parameters than the more traditional strategies employed in steady-state experiments or in surface science experiments. In steady-state experiments the kinetic information is extracted from the transport-kinetics data by experimentally eliminating the effects of transport (e.g., decreasing the size of catalyst pellets, increasing the gas flow rate, etc.). In surface science experiments the gas phase is eliminated so that only surface interactions are observed. In TAP pulse response experiments gas transport is not eliminated. The pulse response data provides information on the transport and kinetic parameters. Because the transport characteristics of any component are constant with respect to composition, a special theory can be constructed to obtain both kinetic and transport characteristics. The critical difference between the TAP and TAP-2 reactor systems is the positioning of the microreactor and the detector that measures the reactor effluent. In the TAP-2 system, the two devices are physically much closer, and as result the detection efficiency or sensitivity of the TAP-2 system is much higher. The TAP-2 system can perform pulse response experiments using much smaller input pulses than the original TAP system, and temperature programmed experiments at vacuum conditions more effectively than the original system. It possible to perform quantitative kinetics on a larger number of catalytic systems with the TAP-2 reactor because pulse response experiments can be performed at lower pressures where Knudsen diffusion is the transport mechanism. Using the TAP-2 system, TAP pulse response experiments can be state-defining experiments. With the TAP-2 system a typical Knudsen pulse contains .;: 1013 molecules or 10-1moles. Assuming a catalyst sample has a surface area of 10 M2/g, a single pulse would be equivalent to 1/1 000000 of the total surface area of a 0.1 g sample. If the active surface area of the catalyst comprises a reasonable fraction (e.g., >0.1 %) of the total surface area of the catalyst, then a single pulse will have a negligible effect on the active surface. In this case, the transient input in a TAP pulse response experiment causes a very small perturbation to the catalytic system, and the system remains substantially in the same state after the measurement as it was before the measurement. Consequently, the kinetic characteristics correspond to a constant kinetic state of the catalyst. Whenever the number of reactant molecules in a pulse is significantly smaller than the number of active species then the TAP pulse response experiment can be state defining. The ideal kinetic installation for performing interrogative kinetics should possess the following fea- J. T Cleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 tures: (1) high time resolution; (2) real-time data acquisition, and (3) the ability for multikinetic analysis (i.e., the ability to perform kinetic measurements in a variety of kinetic regimes on a single catalyst sample, and the ability to rapidly switch from one kinetic regime to another). In addition, it is desirable that the system be capable of supporting complimentary in situ spectroscopic experiments. The TAP-2 system possesses the essential features required for an interrogative kinetic study. A single catalyst sample can be studied over an extended pressure range from atmospheric pressures to high vacuum conditions. A variety of transient response and steady-flow experiments can be performed without exposing the sample to the atmosphere. Reaction products can be monitored in real-time and the catalyst can be cycled rapidly from one kinetic regime to another. This last feature decreases the time required to obtain data, eliminates some experimental uncertainties (e.g., whether the catalyst surface is in the same state during each experiment), and improves the chances of developing accurate correlations. By combining results from complimentary transient response and steadyflow experiments, unique insights regarding the catalytic reaction mechanism and the nature of the active catalytic site can be gained.

Description and operation of the TAP-2 reactor system The TAP-2 reactor system can be used to perform transient response and steady-flow experiments at pressures ranging from 10-6 to 2500 Tow, and temperatures ranging from 200 to 1200 K. The types of transient experiments include high-speed pulse experiments (e.g., TAP pump-probe experiments, multipulse experiments, etc.), step-function experiments for isotopic switching, TPD experiments, and TPR experiments. Most experiments can be programmed using mouse-driven computer software that automatically collects data, and keeps track of experimental conditions when an experiment is running. A general layout of the TAP-2 system is shown in Fig. 1. The basic system consists of: ( I ) a high throughput, liquid nitrogen trapped, ultra-high vacuum system, (2) a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS), (3) a heatable microreactor and temperature controller, (4) a heatable valve/manifold assembly, (5) a gas blending station and gas blending oven for preparing reaction samples from gases and liquids, and (6) a PC computer based control and data acquisition system.

T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 The increased sensitivity of the TAP-2 system over the TAP system is the result of a different vacuum system design that allows a shorter distance between the mass spectrometer and the outlet of the microreactor. The ionizer of the mass spectrometer and the outlet of the microreactor are separated by 1 cm in the TAP-2 system. This distance is an order of magnitude shorter than in the TAP system, and as a result a much larger percentage of the outlet flux can be detected with the new design. Compared to the original TAP system the TAP-2 system's capture efficiency is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater. Another important factor that influences sensitivity is the vacuum system background pressure. This pressure has a steady-state component and a nonsteady-state component. The steady-state background pressure is <_ 10-g Torr, and the signal generated by a minor component in the outlet flow is typically an order of magnitude or more greater than the corresponding signal coming from the background. The nonsteady-state component arises from molecules that are pulsed into the vacuum system, scatter off the vacuum chamber walls, and then enter the ionizer before leaving the chamber. The time response of the nonsteady-state component reflects the pumping speed of the vacuum system, and is different from the time response of the outlet flow. However, the near proximity of the mass spectrometer to the microreactor outlet and the high pumping speed of the vacuum pumps makes the magnitude of the background transient response ;z~ 10 000 times smaller than the outlet flow transient response. A simplified schematic of the TAP-2 vacuum system is shown in Fig. 2. The vacuum system consists of two chambers separated by a pneumatically operated gate valve. The upper chamber contains the QMS and a 2-position slide valve assembly. The slide-valve is used to isolate the vacuum chamber from the microreactor, and to permit the microreactor to be operated at vacuum conditions or atmospheric pressures. The lower chamber contains a liquid nitrogen cold trap, and an optically dense water-cooled baffle. The cold trap enhances the pumping of condensable vapors such as water, and the water-cooled baffle prevents diffusion pump oil from backstreaming into the vacuum chambers. The lower vacuum chamber is connected to a 10 in. oil diffusion pump that is pumped by 35 m3 /h mechanical pump. A molecular sieve foreline trap prevents mechanical pump oil from diffusing into the vacuum system. A thermocouple (TC) gauge located between the diffusion pump and the mechanical pump is used to monitor the foreline pressure. 3.2. Valve-manifold assembly A cross-sectional view of valve/manifold assembly is depicted in Fig. 3. The assembly consists of a stainless steel manifold, four high speed pulse-valves, one manual leak-valve, four vacuum-valves, an aluminum heat shroud, an aluminum heater base, an aluminum manifold housing, and four power mosfet switching circuits. All wetted parts of the manifold and valves are constructed of stainless steel except for the valve stem tips that are made of vespel. The manual leak-valve is used to rough out the microreactor prior to opening the slide valve or to introduce continuous flows into the microreactor. The four vacuum-valves are used to rapidly evacuate the pulse-valves. The pulse-valves are electromagnetically driven by energizing a wire coil with a short current pulse. The current pulse produces an intense transient magnetic field that attracts a magnetic disc which is attached to the valve stem. During a pulse the valve stem lifts out of the valve seat and allows a small quantity of gas to flow out of the valve. When the magnetic field collapses, a spring located behind the magnetic disc forces the vespel tip back into the valve seat. Typical pulse widths (FWHH) are between 250 and 500 ps. Pulse intensities vary less than %. 3.3. Microreactor-oven assembly The standard TAP-2 microreactor is a stainless steel tubular reactor 2.54 cm long and 0.38 cm in diameter. The microreactor contains a 0.05 cm thermocouple, and is electrically heated by a coiled heating element in contact with the reactor walls. The thermocouple is inserted through the reactor wall into the catalyst bed via a removable fitting, and can be replaced if failure occurs. The standard microreactor is designed for operation to 700, and temperature control is within 1 . When operated in a temperature programmed J.

Gas blending station The TAP-2 gas blending station is used for preparing accurate gas mixtures, and producing constant gas flows. The pulse-valve feed system has four gas inputs, one liquid input, and two stirred blending tanks for 61 Molecular Sieve Trap Thermocouple preparing different gas mixtures for the two pulse valves. One blending tank is located in a gas blending oven, and is used in the preparation of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon feeds. The other blend tank is used for the preparation of oxidizing feeds. Blends are prepared by adding different partial pressures of the component gases to the stirred blending tanks. Highly accurate pressure transducers are used to measure gas partial pressures, and reproducibility is typically better than f5%. Flow control is provided by mass-flow 62 J. T.

All wetted parts in the blending system are constructed of stainless steel, or Kalrez. 3.5. Mass spectrometer The TAP-2 system uses a UTI quadrupole mass spectrometer with a mass range from 0 to 300 amu. The key control parameters (i.e., sensitivity, scan width and scan center) can be set manually or from the computer. 3.6. PC based computer system System control and data acquisition are performed with a PC based computer system. All key experimental parameters can be entered from the computer, including, the reactor temperature program, the pulsevalve operating sequence, the pulse-valve intensity, the data collection time, and the mass spectrometer sensitivity. The data acquisition software has a SCAN mode for collecting conventional mass spectra, and a J.T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalvsis TRANSIENT mode for collecting high speed transients. The TRANSIENT mode allows sequential collection of up to five different mass peaks so that a series of product peaks can be collected in a single experimental run. Both formats can be operated in a temperature programmed mode. A separate oscilloscope mode allows the operator to collect data while operating the mass spectrometer manually. Data is stored directly on the computer hard drive during transient experiments, and each product pulse is stored separately. After an experiment is completed the data can be averaged, or each pulse can be viewed individually. Sequences of pulses can be displayed in three dimensional plots. The plotting program also contains software for curve smoothing, for determining the area under a curve, and for determining if the transient response of a pulse is consistent with Knudsen transport. 3.7. Transient response experiments Reactant gases can be introduced into the microreactor in a variety of transient formats at both vacuum and atmospheric pressures. Typical transient formats include introducing pulses in sets of varying length and pulse rate from one or two pulse valves, or in a pump-probe format alternating between two of the four valves. When the system is operated in the highpressure mode, pulses can be introduced at a high repetition rate (>10 pps) to create a step response. Reaction products are analyzed in real-time using the QMS operated in either the TRANSIENT or the SCAN mode. The choice of the QMS operating mode is determined by the time response of the experiment. Generally, high-speed vacuum pulse-response experiments require the TRANSIENT mode. Step-response experiments can be analyzed using the SCAN mode. Fig. 4 illustrates key features of a TAP pulseresponse experiment including the pulse input train from a single pulse valve, and the reactor output that is measured by the mass spectrometer. Typical pulse intensities in vacuum experiments range from 101; to 1017 molecules/pulse, with pulse widths of 2501ts, and pulse rates between 1 and 50 pulses/s. The output transient response spectrum depicted in Fig. 4 indicates that different products are characterized by different transient responses and that the individual product responses can change with pulse number. In A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 the illustrated example, the inert gas pulse intensity is constant with pulse number, product A pulse intensity increases, and product B pulse intensity decreases. Sequential product intensity variations can be associated with changes in reactant conversion rates, and product production rates. These changes can also be associated with changes in the catalyst (e.g., reduction of an oxide surface or the poisoning of a surface by deposited carbon). Fig. 5 illustrates the inputs and transient responses in a TAP pump-probe experiment. In this case, different reactant mixtures are introduced sequentially from separate pulse valves. The output transient response spectrum now contains product pulses coinciding with both valve inputs. For example, one valve may contain a hydrocarbon-inert gas mixture, and the other valve an oxygen-inert gas mixture. By alternately pulsing the hydrocarbon and oxygen mixtures the catalyst surface can be maintained in a relatively constant oxidation state without exposing the hydrocarbon to gas phase oxygen. The pump-probe format can also be used to investigate the dynamics of surface processes involving reactive adspecies. For example, if reactant A forms a transient adspecies that reacts with reactant B, the rate of disappearance of A can be followed by changing the interval between A and B inputs. The pump-probe format is also useful for investigating catalyst activation. In this case, one pulse-valve is used to introduce the activating agent, and the other pulse-valve is used to introduce a reactive probe to monitor the state of the catalyst surface. By monitoring a number of reaction products, changes in activity and selectivity can be observed, and correlated with the incorporation of the activating species. Typical pulse widths (FWHH) for the high-speed transients observed in vacuum pulse-response experiments are in the range of 20-100 ms, and typical pulse rise times are in the range of 2-25 ms. 'To accurately capture these transients it is necessary to sample the reactor output at a submillisecond data acquisition rate, Since the UTI QMS requires ,z~75 ms/scan during a typical scan, it is not possible to collect high-speed transients in the SCAN mode. Consequently, vacuum pulse response data is obtained by fixing the QMS mass number at a specific value during a pulse, and monitoring the change in the mass detector response as a function of time. To observe more than one mass J. T Cleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 Reactant + Inert Gas 250 psec 0.0 1.0 Valve Input -- Time (sec) o.

Elevated pressure experiments Cycling the microreactor between vacuum operation, and elevated pressure operation is accomplished by moving the 2-position slide valve from the fully open position into the closed position, or vice versa. This operation can be performed in seconds. In the closed position a small portion of the effluent exits through an adjustable leak valve into the vacuum chamber, and the remainder escapes through an external vent that contains an adjustable pressure regulator. The external vent may be connected to another analytical device such as a gas chromatograph. In the elevated pressure configuration the microreactor can be operated as a conventional steady-flow or pulsed microreactor. Reactants can be introduced using mass flow controllers, the high-speed pulse valves, or a combination of the two. In addition, temperature programmed experiments can be performed by using a carrier gas to remove desorbing species. When the slide valve is in the closed position the microreactor may be removed. The microreactor can J.T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 Reactant A + Inert Gas (pulse valve 1) Reactant B + Inert Gas (pulse valve 2) c 250 psec 0:0 0:5 Valve Input Reactor Output Time (sec) Pulse Valve 2 Inert Gas (valve 1) Inert Gas (valve 2) ,QMS Product C (valve 1) Product D (valve 2) Time (sec) Increasing Production Decreasing Production Fig. 5.

After the microreactor is evacuated dopant gases can be introduced from the leak valve or the high-speed pulse valves. This technique can be used, for example, to precisely oxidize a catalyst surface. 4. TAP transient response data In contrast to traditional kinetic methods, that measure concentrations, the observable quantity in TAP pulse response experiments is the time dependent gas 65 flow escaping from the outlet of the microreactor. The outlet flow is measured with a mass spectrometer that can detect the individual components of the flow with great sensitivity. The composition of the flow provides information on the types of chemical transformations that have occurred in the microreactor, and the time dependence of the flow contains information on gas transport and kinetics. TAP transient response data can be expressed in a generalized form by dividing the flow that exits the reactor by the number of moles in the input pulse. This quantity is called the `normalized flow', and is used in the analysis of pulse response experiments. From 66 J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (7997) 55-88 another perspective the normalized flow can be viewed as a `temporal probability density', p, where FA NpA FA is the instantaneous flow (mol/s) of A measured at the reactor outlet, and NpA is the number of moles of A in the inlet pulse. Multiplying p by a differential element of time, dt, gives the probability of finding a molecule at the exit of the reactor in that interval of time. A plot of p versus time produces a `temporal distribution curve'. The probability, P, of finding a molecule at the exit of the reactor in the interval (0,t) is given by P, = 1 p dt. 0 (2) The total probability of finding a molecule at the exit of the reactor in the interval (O,oc) is given by P = J p dt. 0 (3) The value of P=1, or P<1 depending on the type of process that occurs in the reactor. For an inert gas or a gas that is reversibly adsorbed, conservation of mass requires that the same number of molecules that are pulsed into the reactor must exit the reactor. In these cases P=1. When irreversible adsorption or an irreversible reaction occurs P<1, and its value is equal to the percentage of molecules not converted. Therefore X (conversion) = 1 - P. (4) The dimensions of an experimentally determined transient response curve are determined by a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the detector and the intensity of a pulse. To transform the experimental response of an inert gas or reversibly adsorbed gas into a normalized flow the experimental response is unitarea-normalized. When irreversible adsorption or reaction occurs the experimental curve cannot be transformed into a normalized flow using unit-areanormalization. In this case, the reactant can be calibrated against an inert gas in a separate nonreactive experiment, and the relative calibration factor can be used to transform the reactant experimental response into a normalized flow. 5. Theory and modeling of TAP pulse response data The grist of TAP theory is vacuum pulse response data. The goal of TAP theory is to interpret this data, and to reveal the complex catalytic mechanism; i.e., (1) to determine the totality of typical processes that make up the complex mechanism, (2) to find the parameters of these processes, and (3) to develop a model of the catalytic center, and the complex catalytic reaction. From the perspective of interrogative kinetics, TAP theory is concerned with analyzing state-defining experiments, particularly with experiments that provide the parameters of diffusion, irreversible adsorption/reaction, and reversible adsorption. These parameters are characteristic of the physical and kinetic state of a catalyst sample. It is instructive to compare the state-defining kinetic parameter, or `kinetic parameter of the catalyst' (KPC) that is obtained in TAP pulse response experiments with the well-known steady-state kinetic parameter `turnover number' [13]. The turnover number, or the `turnover frequency', or the `site time yield' is defined as the rate of reaction per number of active sites. The traditional method of determining a turnover number requires two different types of experiments. The first type involves a determination of the steady-state rate of catalytic reaction. This experiment is performed under conditions in which the disturbing influences of mass and heat transfer are eliminated. The second experiment is an adsorption experiment that provides an estimation of the number of active sites. From a rigorous point of view, the second experiment provides information on the number of adsorption sites, and there is always the question of whether the number of adsorption sites is same as the number of active catalytic sites. The determination of the KPC involves measuring the TAP pulse response of an inert gas and that of a reactant. In this case, the experiments are performed at the same reaction conditions, and on the same catalyst sample in the same kinetic state (for a discussion about the phenomenological kinetic rate equation at constant J.T Cleaves et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (19971 55-88 catalyst composition see [14]). The inert gas response provides a measure of the transport characteristics of the catalyst in the absence of reaction, and contains information about the number of gas-surface encounters. The reactant gas response provides a measure of the transport-kinetics characteristics of the catalyst, and contains information on the number of effective encounters. By combining both measurements it is possible, on the basis of theoretical analysis, to eliminate the contribution of transport, and to obtain the values of the KPC. Examples of this technique are given in this paper. The transport-kinetics interactions that occur in TAP pulse response experiments can be described using either a stochastic or a deterministic approach. Currently, there are two deterministic models based on partial-differential equations. The simplest model, called a 'one-zone-model' is used to describe a reactor that is completely filled with a single catalyst sample, or with a uniform mixture of catalyst and inert material. The more complex, 'three-zone-model', is used when the catalyst sample is sandwiched between two zones that contain an inert material. In the following section, a detailed analysis of the one-zone-model is presented. Special attention is focused on distinguishing typical processes (i.e., finding their patterns or finger prints), and extracting transport and kinetic parameters. Following the discussion of the onezone-model, comparative results obtained with a three-zone-model are presented, and the correspondence between the two models is discussed. 5.1. One-zone-model The mathematical framework for the one-zonemodel was first published in 1988 [3]. This framework is valid for many TAP pulse response experiments, and is also the foundation for understanding more complex models. The basis of the one-zone-model is the following four assumptions: 1. The catalyst bed (or inert particle bed) is uniform, i.e., the fractional voidage in the bed is constant. 2. There is no radial gradient of concentration in the catalyst bed. 3. There is no axial or radial temperature gradient in the catalyst bed. 4. The diffusivity of each gas is constant, and inde pendent of composition. 67 The last assumption is the result of using an evacuated microreactor and small pulse intensities. These two conditions lead to the condition of Knudsen diffusion flow. 5.1.1. Standard diffusion curve In the Knudsen flow regime, the equation of continuity for a nonreacting-gas A in a packed bed reactor is given by d'CaCA A Eb = DeA i O:. (5) From a rigorous point of view, the model should take into account diffusion in both radial and axial directions since the microreactor is cylindrical. Recently a cylindrical model was analyzed in which the pulse input was applied at the center of the inlet face of the reactor. The results of this study show that in this case the one dimensional model is justified [15]. Initial and boundary conditions for the application of Eq. (5) to TAP vacuum pulse response experiments have been discussed in detail in the literature [3,9,1618], and are presented below: Initial condition 0<Z<L, t=0, Boundary conditions oaCA 1 = o, = CA = 6z NPA E'bA (6) (7) z=L CA=0, (8) where CA is the concentration of gas A (mol/cm3), DeA the effective Knudsen diffusivity of gas A (cmZ/s), t the time (s), 17 the axial coordinate (cm), A the crosssectional area of the reactor (cm2), L the length of the reactor (cm), and 6b is the fractional voidage of the packed bed in the reactor. Eq. (6) specifies that at t=0 the gas concentration can be represented by a delta function located at the entrance of the microreactor. Eq. (7) specifies that there is no flux at the reactor entrance when the pulse valve is closed. Eq. (8) results from the fact that the outlet of the reactor is maintained at vacuum conditions, and the concentration of gas at the reactor exit is very close to zero. 68 JT Gleaves et al. lApplied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 The gas flow at the reactor exit, FA (molls) is described by FA = -A&A a A 1Z=L and the gas flux (mol/cm 2 s) by Flu-, = F-AA . A (9) (10) To solve for the gas flow it is useful to express Eq. (5), initial and boundary conditions Eqs. (6)-(8) in terms of the following dimensionless parameters: Dimensionless axial coordinate: Dimensionless concentration: _ CA _ CA NpAwvoid NpAlebAL . (12) The dimensionless concentration is a pulse-normalized gas concentration. Normalization is provided by the pulse intensity related to the void volume of the reactor. Dimensionless time: tDeA EbL2 (13) Written in dimensionless form, Eqs. (5)-(8) are as follows: acA a2 CA = ae Initial condition 0<~< 1, t=0, Boundary conditions o, aCA a ~=1, CA=0. (14) (15) (16) (17) The solution for dimensionless concentration, CA, can be determined by applying the method of separation of variables, and is described as CA (~, T)1 = 2 ~ cos((n + 0.5)7r n=0 x exp(-(n + 0.5)27r2T)). (18) Dimensionless flow, FA (~, 7-), is defined as FA EbL2 (~, T) = Flow NpADeA FA (~, T) can also be expressed as the negative gradient of the dimensionless concentration (19) acA(~ and FA(~,T) _ 7rE(2n + 1) sin((n + 0.5)7r~) n=0 x exp(-(n + 0.5)2T). At the exit, where ~=1, the dimensionless flow can be written as 00 FA=7rE(-1)n(2n+1)exp(-(n+0.5)27r2T). (22) n=0 Eq. (22) expresses the dimensionless exit flow as a function of dimensionless time. The curve described by Eq. (22) is called the standard diffusion curve, and is plotted in Fig. 6. For any TAP pulse response experiment that involves only gas transport the plot of the dimensionless exit flow versus dimensionless time will give one curve regardless of the gas, bed length, particle size, or reactor temperature. Initial condition 15 requires that the area of the standard curve be equal to unity. Eq. (22) can be written in dimensional form as [3,18] (20) (21) FA = DeA2 E(_1)n (2n + 1) NpA EbL n=0 2 tDeA. x exp ~-(n + 0.5) r ~ b , (23) 5.1.2. Properties of the standard diffusion curve Eq. (23) indicates that the normalized flow does not depend on the intensity of the gas pulse. This property is consistent with TAP experimental results that show that the pulse shape for the diffusion only case is independent of the pulse intensity in the Knudsen regime [3]. A unique characteristic of the standard curve is the time (Tp) at which the curve maximum occurs. Tp 1S the time at which the exit flow is at a maximum, and can J.

(22) gives H - 1.85 DeA (28) FA,P = 1.85, (25) P e HPtp = 0.31, (29) and multiplying Eq. (24) by Eq. (25) gives FA,pTp = 0.31. where HP is the peak height of the normalized flow, (26) FA.P/NPA. 70 J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 Eqs. (28) and (29) are very useful new correlations for TAP vacuum pulse response experiments. Eq. (29) shows that for an inert gas the product of the normalized peak height and the peak time is constant, i.e., 0.31, regardless of the particle size, the reactor temperature or the effective Knudsen diffusivity of the gas provided the gas transport is in Knudsen diffusion regime. Eq. (28) shows that the normalized peak height depends on voidage of the packed bed, the length of the reactor and the Knudsen diffusivity of the gas. When the voidage and the length are known, the effective Knudsen diffusivity can be determined from the normalized peak height using Eq. (28). Using Eqs. (24) and (25), Eq. (22) can be rearranged to give FA 01 = 1.70E(-1)\"(2n+ 1) FA,p \"=0 T x exp-(n + 0.5)27 6TP) . In dimensional form, Eq. (30) can be written as 00 FAA = 1.70(-1)\" (2n+ 1) FA,p \"=0 t x exp-(n + 0.5)27r2 6tP) . Eq. (31) shows that the plot of the ratio of the flow and the peak flow versus the ratio of time and peak time is unique. This curve can be used to verify the Knudsen diffusion regime without previous information on the bed voidage, the length of the reactor or the effective Knudsen diffusivity.The ith moment of the dimensionless flow, inis defined as (31) m; = I FAT` dT. 0 (32) The zeroth moment is equal to unity, and the mean dimensionless residence time, determined by dividing the first moment by the zeroth moment, is equal to Tres = 2 (33) Comparing Eqs. (33) and (24) it can be see that the mean residence time is three times the peak time. The product of Eqs. (25) and (33) is TresFA,p = 0.925. (34) Eq. (34) can be transformed to dimensional form and rearranged to give tres = 0.925 . H P (35) Eq. (35) shows that the mean residence time can be estimated from the normalized peak height. Another interesting property is the time at which the average dimensionless exit flow, foFAdT T reaches a maximum, which is given by the expression f 0 ma.-g FA dT FA,r-max-avg = , Tmax-avg (36) (30) where T max-avg 1S the dimensionless time of the maximum average flow, arid FA,r_,nax-avg the dimensionless exit flow at this time. Substituting Eq. (22) into Eq. (36) and solving for Tmax-avg and FA,r-max-avg gives Tmax-avg = 05, FA,r-max-avg = 1.32, and (37) (38) ma -avg PA dT = FA,-r-rnax-avg7max-avg = 0.46. (39) 0 The value (0.46) is the probability of finding a molecule at the exit of the reactor in the interval (O,Tmax-avg). Comparing Eq. (37) with Eq. (24) and Eq. (38) with Eq. (25) shows that Tmax-avg is approximately twice the peak time and FA,T_max_avg is approximately 0.7 times the maximum dimensionless flow. 5.1.3. Application of standard diffusion curve properties Experimentally, the onset of the Knudsen regime can be easily determined by lowering the pulse intensity and observing when the pulse shape becomes independent of the pulse intensity. For a standard J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 reactor, with a typical catalyst charge the pulse intensity must be equal to or less than 1014 molecules/pulse for Knudsen diffusion [17]. A more reliable method of distinguishing the Knudsen regime is to compare the experimental response transformed to dimensionless form to the standard curve. If the curves match then the gas flow is in the Knudsen regime, and the microreactor is uniformly packed. The Knudsen regime can also be distinguished by measuring the peak time and the normalized peak flow. Eq. (29) indicates that the product of the peak time and the normalized peak flow is equal to 0.31. This equation can be used to verify the Knudsen diffusion regime without having to determine the effective Knudsen diffusivity, the length of the reactor or the fractional voidage in the bed. The normalized peak flow is equal to the peak height of the experimental response divided by the area of the experimental response. Another way of distinguishing the Knudsen diffusion regime without having to determine the effective diffusivity of the gas, the length of the reactor, or the fractional voidage of the bed is to transform the experimental response to an experimental peak-normalized response and to compare the transformed response to the unique peak-normalized plot according to Eq. (31). To obtain the experimental peaknormalized response the experimental response is divided by its peak magnitude, and is plotted as a function of (tltP). If the experimental and unique peaknormalized responses match, then the flow is in the Knudsen diffusion regime. Eq. (28) can be used to determine the effective Knudsen diffusivity from the normalized peak height. Eq. (27) can also be used to determine the effective Knudsen diffusivity, but the accuracy is not as good as that determined from the normalized peak height. 5.1.4. Diffusion+ irreversible adsorptionlreaction curve One of the most important and simplest processes studied using TAP pulse response experiments is the process of irreversible adsorption or reaction combined with diffusion. Examples include the irreversible adsorption of simple molecules on metals, the irreversible reaction of hydrocarbons with metal 71 oxides, and so on. If the adsorption or reaction is first order in gas concentration, and the surface coverage is negligible due to the small pulse intensity compared to the amount of active catalytic substance, then the mass balance for the gas phase component A can be described by aCA _ a2CA _ Eb COT = DeA _2 where - Eb)kaCA, (40) where as is the surface concentration of active sites (mol/cm2 of catalyst), S,, the surface area of catalyst per volume of catalyst (cm-1), and ka is the adsorption/reaction rate constant (cm; of gas/mol s). In Eq. (40) the value of the rate constant does not depend on coverage because coverage is negligible. The apparent adsorption/reaction rate constant, ka' (s-' ), is defined as ka' - assv(1 - Eb)ka ^b (41) It should be emphasized that ka' contains the kinetic characteristics of the active site, ka, and structural characteristics of the whole catalytic system, aSSv(1 - Eb)/Eb. Generally, ka', is characteristic of the kinetic state of a catalyst. This state is a function of the composition and structure of the catalyst surface. Changes in the value of ka' indicate a change in the state of a catalyst. It should also be stressed that there are obvious differences between ka', and the apparent rate constant of the complex catalytic reaction determined in steady-state experiments. In particular ka' is the rate characteristic for a unitary adsorption process. The dimensionless apparent adsorption/reaction rate constant can be defined as ka - ka' EbL 2 . DeA (42) The dimensionless form of Eq. (40) can then be written as acA 02 CA OT = a~Z - kaCA. (43) The initial condition and boundary conditions for Eq. (43) are the same as those presented in Section 5.1.1. The solution for dimensionless concentration can be described as a function of dimensionless 72 length and time as J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 00 CA (~, T) = 2 exp(-kaT) ~: cos((n + 0.5)7r n=0 x exp(-(n + 0.5)Z,1r2T). (44) Comparing Eq. (44) with Eq. (18) it can be seen that the concentration of a gas decreases when the molecules undergo irreversible adsorption/reaction. The concentration, at the same time and position in the reactor, is lower than the diffusion-only case by a factor of exp(-kaT). The dimensionless flow is the negative of the gradient of dimensionless concentration and is given by 00 FA(~, T) = rrexp(-kaT) ~:(2n + 1) sin((n + 0.5)7r n=0 x exp(-(n + 0.5)27rZT). The dimensionless flow at the exit, i.e., ~=1, is 00 FA = 7rexp(-kaT) E(-1)n(2n + 1) n=0 x exp(-(n + 0.5)Z7r2T). Eq. (46) can be also written in dimensional form as that reported in literature [3,18] DeA2 exp(-ka't) ~(-1)n(2n + 1) NPA 00 = Ebl, n=0 x exp -(n + 0.5) tDeAl A comparison of Eqs. (47) and (23) shows that the normalized exit flow for the diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction case is less than that for the diffusion-only case by a factor of exp(-ka't). (47) 5.1.5. Properties of the diffusion+irreversible adsorptionlreaction curve From Eq. (47) it can be seen that the normalized flow for diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction does not depend on the intensity of the pulse. This important property of the normalized flow indicates that the conversion is independent of the pulse intensity as long as gas transport in Knudsen flow regime, and the pulse size is small compared to the amount of active sites. The normalized flow expressed in Eq. (47) is the product of an exponential term containing the adsorption rate parameter, and an expression containing the diffusion parameter that is the solution of the normalized flow for diffusion-only case. This fact suggests a method of extracting the irreversible adsorption/reaction rate parameter by comparing the normalized flow for the diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction case with the normalized flow for the diffusion-only case. Eq. (46) shows that dimensionless exit flow is a function of the dimensionless time and the dimensionless irreversible adsorption/reaction rate constant. The peak time (TP) can be determined by setting the derivative of Eq. (46) equal to zero. Unlike the diffusion-only case in which TP is unique, TP in the diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction case (45) depends on ka. When ka is large TP is small, and the dimensionless peak height is also small. The irreversible adsorption/reaction rate constant can be estimated from the peak time and the normalized peak height. The mean residence time of the escaping gas for the (46) diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction case can be determined from a moment analysis. The wroth moment of Eq. (46), mo, and Eq. (47), tno, is the same and is given by (-1)n(2+ 1) Mo =mo=7r~ )Z7r2 + ka n-o (n + 0.5 Eq. (48) can be expressed in another form by Eq. (49)[17]. (48) 1 mo =mo= _ cosh ka (49) Eq. (49) can be used to determine the adsorption rate constant from the zeroth moment or the area of the normalized flow. The conversion, XA, or fraction of gas A that is irreversibly adsorbed is given by XA=1_mo. The first moment of Eq. (46) is described by _ (-1)n(2n + 1) mi _ 7r n=o [(n + 0.5)22 + ka ]2 . (50) J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55--88 The first moment of Eq. (47), ml, is related to the first moment of Eq. (46), and can be expressed as EbLz ml = -ml. DeA (52) The dimensionless average residence time of an escaping gas is given by ml - (-1)\" (2n+ 1) in o 0 [(n + 0.5)Z7r2 + ka ]Z / \"' (-1)\" (2n + 1) x (n + 0.5)'`7r2 + ka Written in dimensional form Eq.

(53) and (54) show that the mean residence time of the escaping gas is a function of the irreversible adsorption/reaction rate constant. Obviously, when the adsorption rate constant is large, the mean residence time of the escaping gas is small. (53) 73 5.1.6. Application of diffusion +irreversible adsorptionlreaction curve properties A new variable, that we have termed the `relative flow', is obtained by dividing Eq. (47) by Eq. (23). The relative flow, which is the ratio of the diffusion+irreversible adsorption/reaction exit flow, and the diffusion-only exit flow is given by (FA/NPA)diff+ads - exp(-ka't). (55) Frel(t) ` (FAN A) P diff Rearranging Eq. (55) gives an expression for the irreversible adsorption/reaction rate constant ka' - -1nFre1(t)' t (56) Eq. (55) shows that normalized flow for irreversible adsorption/reaction is smaller than the flow for the diffusion-only case by a factor of exp(-ka't). Therefore, the curve of the normalized flow for irreversible adsorption/reaction versus time is always smaller than, and does not cross the curve for diffusion-only as shown in Fig. 7. This result is a fingerprint for irreversible adsorption/reaction. Eq. (55) can be written in a differential form as del - -ka1Frel(t) 2.4- 1.9' cf w` 1.4 3 d 0.9 C O .

Fig. 8 presents a plot of the relative flow for the cases shown in Fig. 7. In this approach, the diffusion curve of the reactant can be generated from Eq. (23), or from the standard diffusion curve by transforming it into a dimensional diffusion curve. With either method, the diffusivity of the reactant must be calculated. The procedure for calculating the diffusivity of a reactant from the diffusivity of an inert gas has been described in the literature [11,17]. 5.1.7. Diffusion+reversible adsorption curve When diffusion+reversible adsorption occurs, and the number of molecules is small compared to the number of active centers, the mass balances of a component A in the gas phase, and on the catalyst surface are described respectively by Eqs.

(63) is the product of (5g) fractional surface coverage and a. The latter term is the ratio of the number of moles of active (59) centers, and the number of moles of gas A in the inlet pulse, or the number of active centers per molecule of gas A in the inlet pulse.

BA is called pulse-normalized dimensionless surface concentration, and is analogous to the pulsenormalized dimensionless gas concentration, CA (Eq. (12)). Normalization is provided by the pulse intensity related to the total surface area of the catalyst. It is obvious that is different from the wellknown fractional surface coverage, BA, since BA<l, while BA can be greater than 1 because the local surface concentration, CAS, can be larger than (NpA/ St,,tal) especially at the beginning of the bed. Eqs. (61) and (62) are solved using the initial and boundary conditions presented in previous sections with the additional initial condition for adsorbed A on the catalyst surface Initial condition (66) The solution for dimensionless concentration, CA(~, r), can be obtained by applying the method of separation of variables, and is described by the equation CA (~, r) = 2 : cos((n + 0.5)7r n=0 x [An exp(r_-r)+(1-An) exp(r+-r)], (67) where rt = pn = (n+ 0.5), A_ ( r+ + p+ k,) r+ - r_ -(p,'-, + ka + kd) (p+ ka + kd)2 - 4p2kd 2 (68) (69) (70) The dimensionless flow is the negative gradient of dimensionless concentration, and is described by x FA(~, r) = it Y~(2n + 1) sin((n + 0.5)ir~) n=0 x [An exp(r_T)+(I-An) exp(r+T)j.

Properties of diffusion +reversible adsorption curve In contrast to the case involving irreversible adsorption, the exit flow curve for diffusion +reversible adsorption will cross the exit flow curve for diffusion only. Fig. 9 shows two examples of this phenomenon. The point at which the curves intersect depends on the adsorption and desorption rate constants. When the adsorption rate constant is large, and the desorption rate constant is small the exit flow is characterized by two peaks or humps (gibbosities) [3]. The first of the two peaks resembles an irreversible-adsorption curve. This peak is governed by the interaction between diffusion and adsorption, and is called the `adsorption' peak. The second peak is caused by slow desorption, and is called the `desorption peak'. Modeling [ I 9] shows that the surface coverage initially increases with time because of fast ..sorption, and then the role of desorption becomes significant. The shape of the second peak depends on the parameters of adsorption, desorption, and diffusitivity. A particularly interesting feature of the reversible adsorption curve is the influence of the kinetic adsorption-lesorption parameters on its shape and magnitude. From Eqs. (68) and (72), it can be seen that the shape of the dimensionless exit flow curve depends on the kinetic dimensionless adsorption/reaction and desorption rate parameters ka and kd. Similarly, the shape of the dimensional exit flow curve depends on the dimensional adsorption/reaction and desorption rate 76 1.9 a 1.4- 3 0 m 0.9 C O C 0.4-i C -0.1 J. T.

Comparison of reversible adsorption curves with standard diffusion curve: (A) ka=0; (B) kq=20, kd=20; (C) ka=20, kd=5. parameters, ka' and kd. There is an important difference between the parameters kd and ka', and also an important similarity. The desorption rate parameter kd characterizes the active site, and is a local characteristic. In contrast, ka' (defined Eq. (41) contains as, the surface concentration of adsorption sites (mol/cm2 of catalyst). The parameter as is a structural characteristic of the total catalytic system, and its value is dependent on the methods of preparation of a catalyst. The parameter as can be extracted from the value of ka' at given values of ka and Sv. Thus the parameter ka' characterizes the active site of a catalyst as well as its `global' structure ( `architecture' of the catalyst). The similarity between kd and ka' is that both parameters have the same dimension (s-1), and are the only parameters that can be identified on the basis of the experimental exit flow data. This understanding is very important for catalyst characterization. In our opinion, the extraction of as is very similar to the traditional idea of determining the number of active sites using experimental adsorption data. Fig. 10 shows how the shape of the reversible adsorption curve changes when kd is held constant, and the concentration of adsorption sites, as, is changed. Curve A corresponds to the largest value of as, and curve C to the smallest value. Curve D is the case in which as=0; it is identical to an inert gas curve. The evolution of the exit flow curves represents the evolution of the kinetic characteristics of a catalyst during catalyst deactivation. As the concentration of active sites is decreased the rate of adsorption decreases, and because there are fewer adsorbed molecules the influence of desorption becomes less significant. The decreased influence of desorption causes the intersection point of the reversible adsorption, and inert gas curves to shift to shorter times. The shape of the reversible adsorption curve becomes closer to an inert gas curve. Analogous shape changes are often observed in TAP studies of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. In the case of transition metal oxide catalysts for example, the transient responses of reversibly adsorbed species change in an identical fashion after the oxide surface is oxidized or reduced [20]. The mean residence time of the gas can be found from a moment analysis. The wroth and first moments are given by mo = 1, in, =2C1+kaJ. /d (74) (75) The dimensionless mean residence time that is the ratio of the first moment and the wroth moment is J.

(77) shows that the mean residence time is a function of the equilibrium constant, which is the ratio of the adsorption and desorption rate constants. Eq. (77) can be used to estimate the equilibrium constant from the mean residence time of the response curve. 5.1.9. Fast adsorption-desorption case When the adsorption and desorption parameters are much larger than the diffusivity, Eqs. (68) and (70) can be approximated by + \" 11 ( Key - 1 , r.., -(k;, + kd), _ 1 1 A, 1 + Keq (78) (79) (80) when k;, and kd are very large, ris a very large negative number since it is equal to the negative of the summation of ka and kd (Eq. (79)). The first exponen- (76) tial term in Eq. (72) will then be close to zero after a very short period of time. In this case the expression for flow will consist of only one exponential term, i.e. exp(r+t), and by the use of Eqs. (78) and (80), Eq. (72) can be written for the case in which ka and kd are very large, as FA 1+K L- 7r 21_ eq ( 1 +Ke)'7rZT) eq n--0 4 (81) Comparing Eq. (81) with Eq. (22) it can be seen that the two equations are similar in shape. The difference is due to the factor 1/(1 + Keq). All the ordinates (flows) of the curve are divided by this factor, and all the abscissas (times) are multiplied by this factor. The effect is to transform the standard curve into a flatter, broader curve that has the same relative dimensions. This transformation is called a `baker's transformation'. In this case the, peak time, peak height and their product are expressed by Eqs. (82),(83) and (84). 1 + Keg TP - 6 (82) 78 _ 1.85 FAp 1 + Keq , FA,pTp = 0.31. (83) (84) The peak time is larger than the peak time for the diffusion-only case by a factor of (I+Keq), and the peak height is smaller by a factor of (1+Keq). The product of peak time and peak height is the same as the diffusion-only case. 5.1.10. Gas concentration and surface coverage dependencies Fig. 11 (a) and (b) depict the change in gas concentration and surface concentration, in the center region of a microreactor, with respect to time. Both curves are presented in dimensionless form. The maximum gas concentration and the maximum fractional surface coverage are also presented. The values of the maxima clearly show that the gas concentration and fractional surface coverage are very small under typical experimental conditions. Fig. 12 presents a three-dimensional representation of the gas concentration, and surface concentration phase portraits at nine different positions in a TAP microreactor. The arrows show the direction of time. Both concentrations are zero at time equals zero and at time equals infinity. Fig. 12 shows that the maximum in the gas concentration occurs before the maximum in the surface concentration. After it reaches a maximum, the surface concentration is characterized by a linear dependence on the gas concentration. From a mathematical point of view, this behavior is due to the fact that the solutions for exit flow FA (Eq. (72)), gas concentration CA (~, T) (Eq. (67)), and surface concentration OA (~, T) (Eq. (73)) can be expressed by one exponential term (see Eqs. (85),(86) and (87)) after a sufficiently long time.

Fingerprints of TAP kinetics for adsorption/ reaction and desorption Transient response curves from a `one-zone-reac- tor' are characterized by four `fingerprints' that arise from differences in the rates of adsorption and desorption. Using these fingerprints different cases can be distinguished. 1. Inside-flow. In this case, the flow curve is situated inside the standard diffusion curve, and is the fingerprint for irreversible adsorption/reaction. 2. Intersection. In this case, the flow curve crosses the standard diffusion curve, and is the fingerprint for reversible adsorption. 3. Double-hump curve. In this case, the flow curve has two peaks, and is the fingerprint for fast adsorption and slow desorption. 4. Baker's transformation. In this case, the flow curve is a transformed standard diffusion curve. The transformation can be viewed as dividing the ordinate and multiplying the abscissa of each point of the standard curve by a positive coefficient. The coefficient is (1+Keq) where Key is equilibrium constant. This `baker's transformation' is the fingerprint for `fast adsorption-desorption'. 5.2. Three-zone-model The equations that describe the transport-kinetics interactions in a three-zone-reactor are the same as those used to describe a one-zone-reactor. For inert gases, the diffusion-only equation of the one-zonemodel applies in all three zones. The same equation 80 J. T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 describes a reactant in the two inert zones. The model equation for a reactant in the catalyst zone corresponds to one of the transport-kinetics cases. For example, if irreversible adsorption/reaction occurs then Eq. (40) applies. The initial conditions for the three-zone-model are the same as those for the one-zone-model. The boundary conditions at the reactor inlet and exit are also the same as those for the one-zone-model. Additional boundary conditions are required at the boundaries between the three zones, and are described by CA,zone 1 IZ, = CA,zone 2IZ;, CA,zone 21ZZ = CA,zone 31 Z2' aCA,zone 1 aCA,zone 2 -DeA,zone l aZ ~Z~ _ -DeA,zone 2 oz IZ~ aCA,zone 2 -DeA, zone 2 aZ IZZ (90) (92) aCA,zone 3 -DeA,zone 3 aZ ~Z~ ~ (93) where zl is the axial coordinate at the end of zone 1, and z2 is the axial coordinate at the end of zone 2. Eqs. (90) and (91) correspond to the fact that the concentrations of species at the zone boundaries are continuous. Eqs. (92) and (93) correspond to the fact that the flux that leaves one zone is equal to the flux that enters the adjacent zone. 5.2.1. Criterion of Knudsen regime The criterion for Knudsen flow in a three-zonereactor is similar to that for a one-zone-reactor. When all three zones have the same fractional voidage, and the same gas diffusivities, the criterion for Knudsen flow is given by Eq. (29). More commonly, the gas diffusivity in the catalyst zone is smaller than in the inert zones. In this case, if the lengths and the fractional voidages for all three zones are the same, and the gas diffusivities for zones 1 and 3 are equal, the criterion for Knudsen flow is given by Hp tp < 0.31. (94) In most real cases, however, this product is close to 0.3, even if the fractional voidages are not the same. For example, Hptp = 0.29 when the lengths of all zones are the same, the ratio of the gas diffusivity in the catalyst zone and the gas diffusivity in the inert material zone is 0.25, and the fractional voidages in the catalyst and inert zones are 0.5 (typical of an irregular shaped catalyst), and 0.4 (typical of spherical glass beads) respectively. 23-t 19 15 .r W 11 . 7 0 ~c 3 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 Time (s) Fig. 13.

Fingerprints of TAP kinetics for adsorptionlreaction and desorption The model equations for a three-zone-reactor can be solved numerically using techniques previously described in the literature [17]. Fig. 13 shows typical transient response curies for different values of ka' and kd. These curves can be compared with those obtained for a one-zone-reactor. The fingerprint for irreversible adsorption case is the same as that for one-zonereactor, i.e., the curve of the normalized flow versus time is always `inside' and never intersects the curve for diffusion only. The fingerprints for reversible adsorption in the three-zone-model are also similar to the one-zonemodel. First, the exit flow curve crosses the exit flow curve for diffusion only. Second, at a sufficiently large adsorption rate constant, and a small desorption rate constant the exit flow can have two peaks (`two-hump curve'). Fig. 14 illustrates these results. 6. Verification of Knudsen diffusion in the TAP-2 system The simplest method for the verification of the TAP2 system is the comparison of experimental transport data from a TAP pulse response experiment with Table 1 Characteristics of transport processes in the TAP-2 system when argon is pulsed through a packed bed of glass bead of I50-210 (tm T ('C) liptp De,rep De,tp Ede.t De.Hp fde.H trev,mtre,H rren 50 0.32 15.3 14.8 -2.7 15.5 100 0.31 16.0 15.9 -0.5 16.0 120 0.31 16.1 16.5 2.6 16.5 150 0.31 17.0 17.2 1.0 17.2 200 0.32 17.7 17.2 -2.5 17.9 1.5 0.082 0.084 2.0 -0.4 0.080 0.081 1.3 2.3 0.076 0.078 3.5 1.0 0.073 0.075 2.4 1.2 0.071 0.072 1.7 theoretical predictions.

This agreement is independent of process parameters such as the temperature, the size of the packing particles, or the gases. The percentage relative differences between De,Hp and De,reg for neon and argon are smaller than 2.5% indicating that the determination of the effective Knudsen diffusivity from the peak height using Eq. (28) gives good results. Determination of the effective Knudsen diffusivities from the peak time, De,tp,can differ from effective Knudsen diffusivity determined from regression analysis by more than 6%. The percentage differences of tres.H and tres,m are generally smaller than 2.5%. The diffusion experimental results are in close agreement with the theoretical results. The standard diffusion curve is a useful tool for distinguishing the Knudsen flow regime in TAP experiments. In particular, Eq. (29) is an excellent criterion for Knudsen flow. These results verify that the TAP-2 reactor system can perform Knudsen transport experiments. 7. TAP-2 application - the selective oxidation of n-butane The selective oxidation of n-butane to malefic anhydride (MA) over vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts is arguably one of the most important heterogeneous selective oxidation reactions. It has been studied extensively for the past 20 years, and over one thousand papers and patents have been published on the VPO catalyst system. Currently, it is the only industrially practiced heterogeneous selective oxidation reaction involving an alkane, and is therefore the prototype for other alkane selective oxidation reactions. From a fundamental perspective the oxidation of n-butane over VPO catalysts is an extremely rich catalytic reaction involving the transfer of 14 electrons, the fissure of eight CH bonds, the addition of three oxygen atoms, and a ring closure. Among the various techniques used to study this reaction, the TAP-2 system has proved to be extremely useful for unraveling the complex chemistry, and revealing the nature of the catalytic center. This section presents key results from recent TAP-2 studies of n-butane oxidation over VPO catalysts that illustrate the methodology of `interrogative kinetics'. Although there is extensive evidence [20,21-25] that (VO)ZPzO7 is the active-selective phase in VPO catalysts, it is not clear how the (VO)ZP207 lattice supplies the seven oxygen atoms needed to convert nbutane to MA. The reaction may involve oxygen adspecies adsorbed at vanadium surface sites, and relatively little bulk lattice oxygen, and a number of studies [26] indicate a close correspondence between the number of surface vanadium atoms, and the amount of active oxygen. Other studies [27,28], however, indicate that the amount of active oxygen can significantly exceed the amount of surface oxygen and must include some bulk oxygen. A number of researchers [29,30] have proposed that other crystalline phases are involved in the VPO system, and suggest that the active sites for MA production are situated at the interface of two phases. These contradicting results suggest that there may be more than one catalytic mechanism and more than one type of active center involved in the VPO system, and that the state of the catalytic surface determines which mechanism dominates. Steady-state kinetic studies of n-butane oxidation over VPO catalysts [31,32,33] have yielded different rate expressions and kinetic parameters. Literature values for the activation energy of n-butane conversion over VPO catalysts range from 11 to 27 kcal/mol. The observed differences in kinetic dependencies may J.T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalvsis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 83 be related to differences in catalyst composition, catalyst structure, catalyst oxidation state, etc. The differences in kinetic dependencies from these previous experiments provide no unique information, however, since the various modifications and states of the catalyst cannot be directly compared. From the perspective of interrogative kinetics the problem is to relate changes in kinetic dependencies to changes in the catalyst. The methodology involves a systematic alteration of the state of a catalyst and measuring the kinetic dependencies of the various states. The advantage of using TAP pulse response experiments is that the kinetic dependencies of the different states can be obtained without significantly altering the states. 7.1. 1rret~ersible reaction of n-butane The kinetics of n-butane conversion over VPO catalysts in the absence of gas phase oxygen can be studied by performing a series of TAP pulse response experiments. The preparation of VPO catalyst samples, and the procedures used to perform pulse response experiments have been described in detail c c o.s a w 0.3 0.1 in previous papers [27,28]. Only a brief description of the data collection procedure will be presented here.1n a typical experiment, a sample (100 mg) of `reactor equilibrated' VPO catalysts (surface area X16 m4g) contained in a TAP microreactor is evacuated and heated to reactn temperature. A mture of n-butane and argon is pulsed (10-toles/pulse) over the sample and the transient responses of the reactants, and product species are collected. The reaction temperature is then changed, and more transient responses are collected. After a series of responses at different temperatures has been collected the initial reaction conditions are repeated and another group of responses is obtained. If the final group matches the initial group then the total data set is internally consistent, and can be used to obtain kinetic dependencies. Fig. I S presents typical transient responses for nbutane and argon when a mixture of the gases is pulsed over a VPO catalyst sample at 693 K. The general procedure for kinetic analysis involves: (1) determination of the flow regime (in TAP pulse response experiments the transport mechanism must be Knud- n-B utane Argon 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Time (s) 0.4 O.s Fig. 15.

T Gleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 sen flow), (2) determination of the reaction type (reversible, irreversible), and (3) determination of the kinetic parameters (rate constant, activation energy, pre-exponential factor). To determine the flow regime of the data presented in Fig. 15, the argon response can be matched against a standard curve or more simply the value of Hptp for argon can be determined. In this case, the value of Hptp =0.31 confirming that the flow regime is Knudsen flow (see Section 3.1 above). The number of molecules per pulse is insignificant in comparison to the total VPO surface area and surface coverage is negligible. Comparison of the n-butane transient response curve with its generated diffusion curve indicates that n-butane undergoes a chemical process (e.g., reversible or irreversible adsorption, irreversible reaction). The n-butane curve lies completely within the generated diffusion curve indicating that the chemical process is irreversible (see Section 3.2 above). It can be concluded that the initial step in the complex transformation of n-butane to MA is also irreversible, since the initial step must, by definition, involve collision and adsorption. An irreversible adsorption step is consistent with the fissure of a CH or CC bond. Using the three-zone-model the n-butane transient responses obtained at various temperatures can be modeled using the apparent rate of adsorption ka' as the only parameter to be estimated. The n-butane diffusitivity can be calculated from the argon diffusitivity or by modeling the n-butane transient response data at zero conversion. The kinetic parameters for n-butane conversion can be determined from the plot of the apparent rate constant ka' versus 1/T Using this procedure the kinetics for different states of the catalyst can be determined. 7.2. n-Butane kinetics on oxygen-treated VPO catalysts X-ray analyses of `reactor-equilibrated' VPO catalysts indicate that the predominate crystalline phase is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)zP207. When a `reactorequilibrated' catalyst (bulk vanadium oxidation state = 4.02) is heated (T=400-500) in an atmosphere of oxygen it slowly adsorbs the oxygen [27,28]. The oxygen uptake is accompanied by an increase in the vanadium oxidation state, and eventually a portion of the (VO)ZP207 is transformed into distinct VOP04 phases. The degree to which the oxidation state of the catalyst is altered is determined by the oxygen pressure, the temperature, and the exposure time [27,28]. Conversely, if an oxidized catalyst is reacted with n-butane, or another reducing agent, or heated in a vacuum (T=450-500), then the vanadium oxidation state decreases. Consequently, different VPO catalyst states can be obtained by reacting the VPO catalysts with oxygen or with a suitable reducing agent. When the kinetics of n-butane oxidation is measured over VPO catalysts in different oxidation states dramatic differences in the kinetic dependencies are observed. Fig. 16 shows Arrhenius plots for three different oxidation states of a single VPO catalyst sample. The highest oxidation state was obtained by oxidizing a sample of `reactor equilibrated' VPO catalyst. The other two states were formed by reducing the oxidized sample with n-butane. Since all three plots are obtained from a single sample they can be compared directly. The difference between the curves reflects how the sample changes when it is oxidized or reduced. The Arrhenius plots presented in Fig. 16 are typical results, and reflect the behavior of a variety of VPO catalyst samples prepared by different synthetic procedures [34]. The same behavior has been observed for highly crystalline VPO catalyst samples prepared by aqueous methods, and more amorphous materials prepared by nonaqueous routes. In general, when a reactor-equilibrated catalyst is gradually oxidized the rate of n-butane conversion initially increases as the VPO catalyst oxidation state increases, reaches a maximum at a specific oxidation state, and then decreases [27,28]. The selectivity to MA follows the same trend [27,28] indicating that the specific rate of MA formation parallels the rate of n-butane conversion. The similar trends in n-butane conversion and MA production demonstrate that changes in the VPO catalyst oxidation state produce changes in the catalytic activity and selectivity. From the previous information regarding VPO catalyst oxygen uptake it is reasonable to assume that the parallel changes in the VPO catalyst activity and selectivity are the result of a change in the concentration of the active-selective centers, a structural change (e.g., a new oxide phase) that produces a different catalytic substance, or a combination of both phenomena.

Arrhenius plots for pulsed n-butane conversion over an oxygen-treated VPO catalyst sample as a function of oxidation state. Symbols: experimental data; Solid lines: model prediction. The rate of n-butane conversion is a measure of the number of productive encounters between n-butane and reactive catalytic species on the VPO catalyst surface. The encounter of n-butane with a catalytic species is the initial step in the complex catalytic process that leads to MA and other products. The rate of n-butane conversion can be written in the following general form R = K(CvPO, T)CB, (95) where R is the rate of n-butane conversion, CB the n-butane concentration, Cvthe set (vector) of catalytic substances concentrations, and T is the temperature.K(CvPO, T) is the KPC, and is a function of the temperature, catalyst structure, concentration of catalytic species, etc. Durg a single TAP pulse response experiment K(CvPO, T) will remain essentially unchanged if the pulse is sufficiently small, and the value of K(Cvpo, T) (the apparent kinetic parameter) can be extracted from the pulse response data (Section 5.1.4). In this case K(CvPO, T) is very similar to a 'sticking coefficient'. For some cases, it is possible to express K(CvPt~, T) as the product of two functions K(Cvro, T) = K(Cox, T)CoX, (96) where Cox is the concentration of the active catalytic species and, for the simplest case K(CvPO, T) = K(T)Cox and the rate of n-butane conversion becomes R = K(T)CoxCB. (97) (98) Assuming the rate of n-butane conversion is represented by Eq. (98) we can obtain values for the KPC (i.e., K(T)Cox), and the activation energy (Ea). For the example presented in Fig. 16, E;,z~ 12 kcal/mol on the two most highly oxidized VPO catalyst surfaces, and 23 kcal/mol on the least oxidized surface. The rate of n-butane conversion is highest on the VPO surface with the highest oxidation state, and is more than an order of magnitude lower on the surface with the lowest oxidation state. Fig. 16 shows that the values of the KPC and the apparent activation energy are strongly dependent on 86 J. T. Gleaves et a1. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 the VPO catalyst oxidation state. When the vanadium oxidation state decreases from the top state to the middle state the apparent kinetic parameter decreases, but the activation energy remains essentially constant. The simplest interpretation of these phenomena is that the number of active centers decreases with the oxidation state, but the structure of the centers remains the same. When the oxidation state of the catalyst is further reduced there is a sharp increase in the apparent activation energy while the apparent kinetic parameter remains essentially constant. In this case the active center may change while the number of centers is essentially constant. This behavior is consistent with the alternatives mentioned above for the evolution of VPO catalytic activity, namely, a change in the number of active centers, a change in the structure of the active centers, or both. Recent TAP-2 and Raman spectroscopic studies confirm that oxidation of reactor-equilibrated VPO catalysts results in the formation of new V5+ phases, and that a specific combination of V4+ and V5+ phases gives the most active and selective surface [ 19]. 8. Concluding remarks The first paper describing the TAP pulse response experiment, and the application of TAP in heterogeneous catalysis was published in 1988 [3]. After a short `induction period' research groups in academia and industry (in USA, Germany, France, Belgium and Netherlands) [3-12] began using the TAP system to study a variety of catalytic reactions. Also during this period the TAP-2 system was developed, and activity in this area will undoubtedly continue. TAP reactor systems are being used in fundamental and applied studies: to reveal the mechanisms of industrial and model catalytic reactions; to assist in the design of new catalyst; to test the industry catalysts; to make the recommendations concerning new regimes for industrial reactors. At the risk of being taken for prophets we will make some predictions regarding future developments this area. 8.1. TAP-2 modifications Future TAP system research will be focused on combining the TAP-2 experimental apparatus with other physical tools (IR and Raman spectroscopy) to allow both the gas phase and the catalyst to be monitored together. The key idea is to combine TAP pulse response, and other transient experiments with in situ spectroscopic techniques. These complimentary experiments will be incorporated into modified TAP systems, and used to simultaneously investigate surface adspecies, desorbing reaction products, and the catalyst structure during catalytic reactions. Currently, there are few examples of simultaneous monitoring of surface and gas species using transient response techniques. By combining these approaches to simultaneously observe different aspects of the catalytic process in real-time more information will be obtained than if the experiments are performed separately. Simultaneous monitoring of different experimental observables also eliminates uncertainties (e.g., whether the catalyst surface is in the same state during each experiment) that arise when performing separate experiments, decreases the time required to obtain data, and improves the chances of developing accurate correlations. From our point of view, the simultaneous observation of surface and gas species is essential for understanding the molecular-level mechanism of complex catalytic reactions. 8.2. TAP-2 and `interrogative kinetics' We believe that interrogative kinetics represents a promising new methodology for exploring complex catalytic systems. It is reasonable to predict that as the TAP experiment continues to be developed and applied, the methodology of `interrogative kinetics' will be refined. We anticipate the development of new combinations of state-defining and state-altering experiments. The combination of these experiments can provide information about changes in a catalyst, and the nature of the catalyst during the reaction. Special attention will be paid to experiments that test the reproducibility of a catalyst. We also anticipate that future theoretical studies will provide new fingerprints and procedures. The methodology of interrogative kinetics seeks to build an understanding of structure-activity relationships by J. T Cleaves et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 160 (1997) 55-88 asking `many' questions from different experimental perspectives. An important advantage of this approach is that it can provide fundamental information regarding structure-activity relationships while leading directly to an improved state of a catalyst.

The TAP-2 reactor system and the theoretical basis of TAP pulse response experiments are discussed. On the basis of the TAP system, an alternative to the traditional kinetic approach in heterogeneous catalysis is developed. This new approach, termed ‘interrogative kinetics’ involves a combination of two types of kinetic experiments called ‘state-defining’ (friendly) and ‘state-altering’ (typical) experiments. The state defining kinetic parameter, or ‘kinetic parameter of the catalyst’ (KPC) is proposed and compared with the kinetic characteristic ‘turnover number’. The theory of TAP pulse response experiments is developed. Two deterministic models based on partial-differential equations are analyzed for the cases of diffusion, irreversible adsorption/reaction and reversible adsorption. The ‘standard diffusion curve’ that can be used for distinguishing the Knudsen flow regime is described, and simple criteria of the Knudsen regime are proposed. The concept of relative flow is described, and different fingerprints of TAP kinetics for irreversible adsorption/reaction and reversible adsorption are presented. TAP-2 experimental results on the selective oxidation of n-butane are used to illustrate the methodology of interrogative kinetics.
