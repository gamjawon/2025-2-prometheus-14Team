On this last class of solids the concentration of hydroxyl groups decreases by adsorption of methanol whereas the reverse is observed on copper-containing catalysts, where also lower temperatures are required for the transformation of the methoxy groups into more oxidized species such as formate and carbonates. The influence of copper on these processes is explained by the spillover of hydrogen, through copper ions, from the methoxy groups to oxygen ions of zirconia.

Introduction In the previous publications of this series [ 1-4] the controversy concerning the nature of the pivotal species in the synthesis of methanol from the reactants H2, CO, CO2 was largely discussed. It is generally assumed that either a formate or a carbonate type species is this pivotal intermediate. The controversy also concerns the nature of the reactant carbon monoxide or/and carbon dioxide which leads to this species. The support of zirconia is by itself a catalyst for the synthesis of methanol in contrast to silica or alumina supports [5 ] and, in addition, it provides * Corresponding author. Tel.

Bianchi et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 123 ( 19951 89 110 adsorption sites for the surface reaction intermediates [6]. The first property of zirconia was explained [ 1 ] by its capacity to store hydrogen. The second property implicitly assumes that any intermediate species formed on one of the constituents of the catalyst (such as the formate species which may be formed on copper or on zinc) can be transferred onto some other constituent [5] and that this generalized aspect of spillover may become a part of the mechanism of the methanol synthesis. Indeed, if such a species can be hydrogenated into methoxy species at temperatures lower than its decomposition temperature into CO, CO2, H2 and H~O [7] the ease of the transfer of this species to the hydrogenating centres, possibly with the help of the support, may determine the activity of the catalyst. If the energetics of the formation of the species does not change much for the various sites involved, the driving force for its transfer would be the surface concentration gradient [8]. The hydrogen spillover from ZnO and/or CuO onto zirconia and the carbon monoxide spillover from CuO onto zirconia was envisaged previously [ 1,3 ]. In the chain of the intermediates the methoxy species is the final one. The investigation of its stability, surface concentration and of its eventual transfer onto various constituents of the catalyst may provide, by this sort of a reverse path, the clue to its origin and to the nature of the pivotal species. To obtain the methoxy species on the catalyst surface the interaction with methanol is the simplest method. This interaction with oxides such as ZnO, TiO2, ZrO2 [9-13], MgO [ 14], A1203, SiO2, CuO/ZnO and CuO/ZnO/AIRO3 [7,15-17] was studied to a rather limited extend. The formation of species such as formate, oxymethylene and various types of carbonates was also detected during this interaction [ 15,16,18]. The TPD experi- ments of adsorbed methanol showed its decomposition into CO, CO2, H2, CH4, HCOOH, HCHO and dimethyl ether (DME) [9-11,17]. Studying the nature of the species formed by the interaction with methanol of the various catalyst com- ponents and tracking the desorption products may therefore help in defining steps that lead from the adsorption of reactants (CO, CO2, H2) to the formation of the reaction product (CH3OH) or at least of some essential intermediate. To be com- plete this study also involves, in the forthcoming paper, that of the interaction with hydrogen of various adsorbed species. 2. Experimental Isothermal adsorption of reactants and reaction products, followed by tempera- ture-programmed desorption (TPD) or reaction (TPR), termed transient methods, were described previously [ 1-4] together with IR spectroscopy. In the present case the adsorbate is liquid methanol which is introduced into a saturating device and its vapour is carried out by a stream of helium. The vapour pressure of methanol used in this work is selected in the interval 37.5 Torr (5) to 135 Torr (25) ( 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa). In this series of papers four aerogel catalysts are investigated, all supported by zirconia aerogel which, by itself, also catalyses methanol synthesis D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 91 [18,19]. They are: ZrO2, ZnO (5%)/ZrO~, CuO (5%)/Zr02 and the ternary aerogel CuO (5%)/ZnO (5%)/ZRO2. Their preparation and properties were described previously [ 1,2] as well as their pretreatment, first in oxygen and then in helium at 400 (standardization), required to remove various organic impurities from the surface. Their interaction with methanol gives results which are sufficiently different for each catalyst to deserve a separate description. It is also easier, in this way, to distinguish the contribution of ZnO and/or CuO to ZrO2 in the mechanism of the interaction of the catalyst with methanol. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Interaction of methanol with ZrOz Study by the transient methods The isothermal (25) adsorption of methanol ( 520/~mol / g or 1.55.1014 tool / cm2, under 135 Torr) on zirconia aerogel is presented in Fig. 1 and shows a simultaneous desorption of water ( 15/~mol/g). Such a phenomenon was already noted in the past for ZrO2 [9,10] and also for silica [20,21]. Nine gaseous com- ponents are detected in the TPD experiment under helium which follows the iso- thermal adsorption of methanol: CH3OH, CH4, H20, CO, CO2, H2 and mass spectroscopy peaks for m/e = 30, 45, 46 (Fig. 2) which probably represent ethane, dimethyl ether (DME) and formic acid, respectively, and which are not quantified in Fig. 2. The non-transformed methanol is desorbed in five peaks at mean temper- atures (Tin) of: 160, 210, 290, 340 and 390. The total amount of methanol desorbed without decomposition into one of the previous gases is 210 p~mol/g and represents therefore 40% of the total amount adsorbed.

In the first process, at Tm= 430, meth- anol is transformed into methane (15/~mol/g) DME and HCOOH. In the second process, at Tm= 570, large quantities of H2 (350/~mol/g) and CO (240 p~mol/ g) are accompanied by small peaks of DME, CH4 (3 p~mol/g) and the peak of ethane. It has been shown [2] that by the reduction of zirconia aerogel, during the TPR experiment under carbon monoxide, 35/~mol/g of hydrogen are evolved from the hydroxyl groups. The production of 350/_Lmol/g of hydrogen by interaction with methanol shows that hydrogen comes mainly from the decomposition of adsorbed methanol. At some intermediate temperature Tm= 470 a minor process, giving the peak of carbon dioxide (Fig. 2) (7/~mol/g) together with the beginning of the release of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at Tm= 570, accounts for a limited oxidation of methanol (see below). A large peak of water (225/~mol/g) between 25 and 570 is accompanying the two main processes. All the TPD results are summarized in Table 1. The TPD experiment shows therefore that methanol which remains adsorbed is stable on pure ZrO2 up to 390. Above this temperature, at Tm =430, the following global reactions take place: hydrogenation~tehydrogenation giving methane and HCOOH and condensation giving DME and water: 2CH3OH(.d~) ~ CH4(g) + UCOOU(g) + H2(ads) ( 1 ) 2CH3OH(ad~) --~ CH3-O-CH3(g) + HeO(g) (2) Hydrogen is not released in this first process. At the next temperature, Tm= 470, the minor production of carbon dioxide is probably related to the decomposition of surface formate species ( see below) and, finally, at 570, hydro- gen is evolved together with carbon monoxide which probably results from the decomposition of the methoxy groups (see below); D. Bianchi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 93 2CH30-(ads~ ~ 2CO(g) + 3H2(g) Some carbon is deposited on the surface during these processes because the TPR experiment under oxygen which follows the previous TPD experiment, gives a peak of carbon dioxide (20/xmol/g) at Tm= 590. The balance of carbon shows that the peaks for m/e = 30, 45 and 46 (which amount to 28/xg of C/g) represent very minor constituents. The TPR experiment under methanol (18%), between 25 and 700 on a standardized zirconia aerogel shows a profile very similar (not shown) to that of the TPD of the preadsorbed methanol experiment (Fig. 2). The only difference is that the continuous flow of methanol ceases at 530 because the incoming methanol vapour is now decomposed into H20, CO and H2. A second difference with the TPD experiment is the formation in TPR of methane, carbon dioxide and of peaks m/e = 45, 46 (DME and HCOOH) already at 300 with Tm= 430 ( the same Tm as in the TPD experiment of preadsorbed methanol). Therefore, in the temperature range of the methanol synthesis (250-350) it is Table 1 Summary of the TPD and IR results on aerogel catalysts ZrO2 ZnO/ZrO~ CuO/ZrO2 CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 520 420 210 290 Methanol adsorbed (~mol/g) at 25 under 135 Tort Methanol desorbed (/zmol/g) during the TPD Number of peaks T,~, temperatures () Methanol decomposed ( p.mol/ g) during the TPD Gas desorbed (/xmol/ g ) in main peaks at T,n () during the TPD Evolution of species (IR data) by adsorption of CH3OH (the most abundant species is underlined) 210 180 70 135 5 3 4 160,210~290. 160,190,270 210,310,330,380 340,390 310 240 140 CH4, DME, HCOOH at Tm 430 CO2 (7) at Tm-470 H2(350) CO (240) at ~,=570 H20 (225) between 25 and 570 OH OCH3 ~ 350 formate ~ H20 (60) H2 CO2(110) H2(4) (180) CO2(45) at CO(8) H20(290) Tm= 350 at Tm= 320 CO (180) H2 (170) at ~,~=440 OH \"~ OCH3 7 350\"~ formate /~ \",~ unidenlate carbonate /~ OH /\" OCH3 ~ 200\"~ formate and unidentate carbonate at 25 then p carboxylate /\" ionic carbonate /\" 4 120,190,240,300 155 CO2 130) H2 (45) CO (10) at Tm= 350 H20 (250) from 400 OH /\" OCH3 ,7 200 formate and unidentate carbonate at 25 then /\" carboxylate /~ ionic carbonate 9 94 D. Bianchi et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 also necessary to envisage its decomposition on ZrO2. This decomposition does not proceed from the adsorbed methanol because in the TPD experiment of pread- sorbed methanol the first release of gases (CH4, DME and HCOOH) was registered above 390 (Fig. 2). In the TPR experiment under methanol the reaction which starts at 300 may proceed through the Rideal-Eley mechanism, involving adsorbed species (formed from methanol) and gaseous methanol. In the TPD experiment of preadsorbed methanol the compounds desorbed may be formed directly through interaction of adsorbed methanol with the surface of the solid or they may result from surface reactions of species formed from adsorbed methanol. Their desorption may be coincident to their formation or it may be delayed with respect to the rise of the temperature in the TPD. The infrared analysis brings a remarkable help in this investigation. Study by Fourier transform infrared (FT-1R) spectroscopy The adsorption of methanol ( 135 Torr in helium flow) at 25 on a standardized zirconia results in the disappearance of the initial hydroxyl groups at 3770 cm ~, described in ref. [ I ], whereas the second band of the hydroxyl groups at 3680 cm I is barely affected. Simultaneously, the large band of the hydroxyl groups in interaction, at 3300 cm- ~ [ 1 ] is formed (Fig. 3A)together with the band at 1635 cm I corresponding to the adsorbed water (Fig. 3B). This is in agreement with the isothermal formation of water (Fig. 1 ) and that detected by TPD (Fig. 2) after adsorption of methanol. This adsorption consumes therefore the hydroxyl groups, releasing water even at low temperatures (25) and it does not correspond to the dehydration of the surface but to the reaction: CH3OH(g) + M-OH --* M-OCH3- -+-H20(ad .... d g) 3770 cm ' 1635 cm ' The absence of the restoration of the hydroxyl bands by generated water was discussed previously [ 1 ]. The simultaneous formation of the methoxy groups is accounted for by their strong bands at 2930, 2825 (Fig. 3A) and 1144 cm 1 (Fig. 3B) accompanied by low intensity bands at 1460 and 1440 cm- 1 (Fig. 3B). All these bands are attributed to the methoxy groups [7,9-11,22-24] (see also Table 1 in ref. [2] ). However, all the methanol adsorbed cannot be represented by the previous equation. Indeed, the amount of water desorbed during the isothermal adsorption (25) of methanol is 15 /zmol/g and represents the consumption of 4.50.10~20H/cm2 whereas the amount of methanol adsorbed represents a density of 1.55- 1014 mol/cm2 (see above). Centres other than the hydroxyl groups also provide sites for the adsorption of methanol. The most probable are the oxygen ions of zirconia: O OCH3 OCH3 / \\ I I 2 CH3OH (ads) + M1 M2 ~ Ml + M2 H20(g and ads) D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 95 In other words, methanol, first isothermally adsorbed in great excess with respect to the density of the hydroxyl groups is converted into methoxy groups during the TPD experiment, with the help of the hydroxyl groups and mainly with the help of the oxygen ions of zirconia. The zirconia support may therefore be the host of the adsorbed methanol and of the methoxy groups during the synthesis [5,6]. If these groups or their precursors are formed initially on some other constituents of the catalyst, such as copper or zinc [5,6] their spillover onto zirconia may be easily envisaged. Finally the spectra of Fig. 3B also show the presence of small amounts of the formate species, characterized by the bands at 1570, 1380 and 1370 cm ~ (see Table 1 of ref. [2] ). After adsorption of methanol at 25 the aerogel is swept with helium and the TPD process (10/min) is followed by FT-IR between 25 and 400 [4]. The spectra obtained for various temperatures (Figs. 3A and B and Fig. 4) show that the large band of the hydroxyl groups in interaction, at 3300 cm- ~, and the band of physisorbed water ( 1635 cm ~ ) vanish around 200 whereas the i4 3600 3000 2400 Wavenumber (cm-1) B. 0 o 0.35 (a) (dl 7- ~r,- I I I I 1900 1475 1050 Wavenumber (cm-1) Fig. 3.

The bands of the formate species vanish at 350 (Fig. 3B) but the intense bands of the methoxy groups, at 2930, 2825 (Fig. 3A) and 1144 cm J (Fig. 3B) decrease only moderately when the temperature increases. It is also of interest to follow the adsorption of methanol at the temperature of its synthesis. The FT-IR spectra after adsorption of methanol at 250 are shown in Figs. 5A and B. Again, the high intensity bands of the methoxy groups are observed at 2930, 2825 and 1144 cm 1 (Fig. 5A). The bands of the formate species at 1570, 1380 and 1370 cm l are better defined at this adsorption temperature (Fig. 5A). Again, a large band of the hydroxyl groups in interaction at 3300 cm-~, is well observed (Fig. 5B), whereas both bands of the hydroxyl groups, at 3770 and 3680 cm l, decrease considerably. After sweeping methanol by helium at 250 (spectrum c, Fig. 5A) the bands of the methoxy groups hardly decrease but the bands of the formate species increase definitely. It seems therefore that methanol adsorbed at 2500C in the form of methoxy groups may be converted on zirconia into formate species. Simultaneously, the band of the hydroxyl groups in interaction, at 3300 cm- ~, almost vanishes whereas the bands of these groups at 3770 and 3680 cm ~ slightly increase (Fig. 5B). It is of interest to compare the results of the IR spectroscopy with those obtained in the TPD experiments (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1 ). The decomposition of adsorbed methanol occurs at Tm= 430 and leads to the formation of methane, DME and HCOOH. The formation of methane is generally interpreted by the reaction between an adsorbed methoxy group and the hydroxyl group [ 9,10,25]\" OCH3 OH O I I /\\ M + M~ CH4(g) + M M It has been shown indeed that these hydroxyl groups are the source of hydrogen [ 1 ]. The total density of the hydroxyl groups on a standardized surface of ZrO2 is 0.2 D. Bianchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 97 2.1.1013 OH/cm2 [2]. The adsorption of methanol at 25 consumes 4.5.1012 OH/cm2 (band at 3770 cm- ] ). The hydroxyl groups remaining after this adsorp- tion (band at 3680 cm-~) producing the methoxy groups and water, may allow the formation of methane. Its amount released (15 ktmol/g) corresponds to a density of 4.5. I0~20H/cm2 consumed and is therefore equivalent to the density of OH sites (band at 3770 cm l) required for the formation of the methoxy groups. The total depletion of the hydroxyl groups: (i) by the formation of-OCH3 and (ii) by the formation of methane represent therefore a density of 9.1012 OH/cm2. Hence, these reactions do not eliminate all the hydroxyl groups of the surface of zirconia aerogel and the remaining hydroxyl groups ( 1.2.1013 OH/cm2) are prob- ably those responsible for the band at 3680 cm i which is not entirely suppressed (Fig. 5B). 0.28 \" (el =Y 2 < 0.28 e.- 0 < - ~ 1 1 I 3100 2650 1750 Wavenumber (cm.t) (aJ IcJ I 1050 B. i.2 O e,\" t~ O < a I I 4000 3200 Wavenumber (cm-1) Fig. 5.

Bianchi et al. / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 123 (1995) 89 I 10 The formation of the formate species by interaction of the surface with methanol was demonstrated above by the IR spectroscopy. The peak of carbon dioxide (7 /xmol/g) at Tm= 470 during the TPD experiment was attributed (see above) to the decomposition of the formate species. This hypothesis is now developed as follows. The highest temperature of the carbon dioxide peak in the TPD experiment of carbon dioxide preadsorbed on zirconia aerogel [4] is Tm = 380. This tem- perature is therefore lower than that mentioned above ( Tm = 470), but it is close to the temperature Tm = 410 of the decomposition, during the TPD, of the formate species into CO2, CO and H2, according to the reaction [2]: H I c /..-x. 0 0 OH 1Ill /V~ I CO2 (g)+ 7 H2 (g) + M(reduced) \"~21\\MkY-'~ CO(g) + M [3] Now, in the present case of the interaction with methanol, the peak at Tm= 470 during the TPD concerns only carbon dioxide. The peaks of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (Fig. 2) are registered at T,, = 570, but at Tm= 470 some production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen already occurs (Fig. 2). These two gases prob- ably cannot give peaks distinct from the major peaks of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at Tm = 570 because the amount of the formate decomposed is too small to allow such a distinct peak. The formation of the formate species may be envisaged by the interaction between the methoxy and hydroxyl groups [26] (still present, band at 3680 cm 1) or surface oxygen ions [ 11,27]: H I CH3 C I /...\\. o OH O O I I \\/ 3 MI + M2 ~MI + ~ H2(g)+ Me(reduced) 3680 cm-I or H I CH3 C I /.% o o o o I II \\ / M1 + M2 ~ MI H2(g)M2(reduced) However, the major production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at Tm= 570 during the TPD of adsorbed methanol (Fig. 2), together with small amounts of methane and ethane, is rather related to the decomposition of the still not decom- posed methoxy species.

It is the decomposition of the methoxy groups which is thus the source of hydrogen and of carbon monoxide: CH3 I O l 3 M --~ CO (g) + ~ H2 + M (reduced) and the source of methane, for a small fraction of the reactant [ 9,10,25 ] : CH3 t O I 2 M ---) CO (g) + H20 (g) + CH4 + 2 M(reduced) Similarly, the formation of ethane could proceed also from the methoxy groups : CH3 I O OH I [ 2 M H2 (~ C2H6(g) + 2 M accompanied by the dehydroxylation of the surface at the temperature considered OH O I / \\ 2M ---~H20(g) + M M Finally, the FT-IR spectrum (not shown) during the TPR experiment in the presence of methanol (mentioned above) clearly shows the production of the formate species at T> 150 (bands at 2967, 2880, 1570, 1380 and 1370 cm 1) whereas these species are not formed in high concentration from the preadsorbed methanol (Fig. 5A). It is probable that in the presence of methanol vapour, in the TPR experiments, the hydroxyl groups are reformed and react with the methoxy groups to give the formate species: H I C /.-.x O OCH3 OH O' 'O /\\ I I \\/ 3 CH3OH(g)+ M1 M2 \"\"~MI + M2~M1 + ~ HZ(g)+ M2(reduced) 100 D.

The remaining fraction ( 240/xmol / g) of adsorbed methanol ( 57 % ) is decomposed in two major processes (absence of the intermediate process observed for pure ZrO2): (i) at Tm=350 with the production of H20 (60 /xmol/g), H2 (180 /xmol/g) and CO2 (45/xmol/g) giving a ratio C/H =- 0.25, which shows that some carbonaceous species still remain adsorbed whereas hydrogen desorbs, (ii) at Tm = 440 with the production of CO ( 180/xmol/g) and H2 ( 170/zmol/g) giving a ratio C/H = 1.05. At a still higher temperature, Tm = 470, small peaks of meth- ane (4/xmol/g) and CO2 ( 2/xmol/g) are registered and probably represent a very minor process. The analysis of the carbonaceous residues by TPR under oxygen which follows the TPD experiment accounts for the formation of 15 #mol/g of carbon dioxide. The balance of carbon (TPD + TPR/O2), which is 426/xmol/g, is in good agreement with the amount of methanol isothermally adsorbed at 25 (420/xmol/g). The ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst, in contrast to pure ZrO> does not desorb DME and HCOOH at Tm = 350. An important hydrogen peak ( 180/xmol/g) is observed instead at this temperature while it was absent on pure ZrO2. Also, the second process peaks of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are observed at Tm = 440 for ZnO/ZrO2 instead of 570 for pure ZrO2. The adsorbed species are therefore less stable on binary aerogel than on pure ZrO2. Table 1 summarizes all these results. FT-IR spectroscopy The adsorption of methanol ( 135 Torr in helium flow) on the standardized ZnO/ ZrO2 aerogel is performed at 37 because neither desorption nor decomposition processes are recorded below this temperature (Table 1). The FT-IR spectrum is recorded during the TPD process in helium and is shown in Fig. 8A. As for pure ZrO2, bands of the methoxy groups are recorded at 2930, 2825, 1460, 1440 and 1144 cm-1. The fine and intense band at 2930 cm-1 seems to be superimposed onto a large band of a small intensity, also centred at 2930 cm- ~. This probably results from the various possibilities of formation of the methoxy groups on ZnO/ ZrO2 surface, such as those discussed before: O OCH3 OCH3 / \\ I I 2 CH3OH(g) + M M ~ M + M + H20(g and ads) and OH O OCH30 l/ \\ \\ / \\ CH3OH (g) + M M----~ M M + H20(ads) These various forms of methoxy groups cannot be resolved by IR spectroscopy but they may correspond to different decomposition processes on ZnO/ZrO2 (Fig. 7) as is discussed below. 102 D.

As for pure ZrO2, the adsorption of methanol produces a decrease of the band at 3770 cm- ~ of the hydroxyl groups. Conversely, the band at 3400 cm- t of the hydroxyl groups in interaction, is now apparent (Fig. 8B). Also bands of the D.

During the TPD process, the intensity of the bands of the methoxy species decreases above 270 and simultaneously that of the bands of the formate species, at 2967, 2882, 1570, 1380 and 1370 cm I first increases and then decreases (b to d, Fig. 8A). The bands of the methoxy groups vanish completely at 370 but those of the formate species are still present at this temperature, together with the new bands at 1480 and 1340 cm ~ which can be attributed to the unidentate carbonate species [28] (see also Table 1 ofref. [2] ): ....... O M+__O_C~/ X O- The bands of the hydroxyl groups in interaction, at 3400 crn- ~, vanish, and that of the hydroxyl groups, at 3680 cm-l, which barely interact with methanol, decrease in contrast to the band at 3770 cm- ~ which increases with the temperature of the TPD process (Fig. 8B) above 300. If the adsorption of methanol (in helium) on ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel is carried out directly at 250 the FT-IR spectra are still the same as those just discussed. The isothermal desorption of methanol at 250 (by sweeping with helium) produces a net decrease of the bands of the methoxy groups which disappear entirely in about 15 rain, whereas the bands of the formate species increase simultaneously. It is of interest to compare now the TPD and IR data concerning the binary catalyst with those concerning pure ZrO2. The TPD spectrum of the binary solid (Fig. 7 ) is modified with respect to that of pure ZrO2 (Fig. 2). The Tm temperatures of various processes are lower for ZnO/ZrO2 (Table 1 ) and in the first decompo- sition process in the TPD experiment hydrogen is evolved instead of DME and HCOOH. The binary aerogel also produces a smaller amount of water during the TPD experiment and produces no water at all during the isothermal adsorption of methanol at 25 (compare Figs. 1 and 6). If the methoxy groups formed on both catalysts after adsorption of methanol present various structures, as discussed above, the second difference is the absence of water formation at 25 for ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel. Water is, however, evolved during the TPD experiment (but not isother- mally at 25) for ZnO/ZrO2, and lower desorption temperatures (in 3 peaks) are required for methanol (instead of 5 peaks for pure ZrO2, Table 1), but the binary catalyst is already at 100 able to convert the adsorbed methanol into the formate species (Fig. 8A). Moreover, the intensities of the bands of the formate species increase notably with the temperatures of the TPD process whereas those of the methoxy species decrease. This process reveals the transformation of the methoxy groups into formate species, simultaneously with the loss of hydrogen (Tm = 350 on ZnO/ZrO2). The generated formate species are relatively stable because their bands do not disappear at 370 whereas those of the methoxy groups are absent at that temperature and the bands of the hydroxyl groups are also lower. At the same time the unidentate carbonate species are generated, probably by oxidation 104 D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 123 (1995) 8~1 lO of the formate species. The following mechanisms account for these reactions [ as mentioned previously for Eq. (4) ]: H CH3 H I I I C /,.% O O O O I I \\/ M1 + M2-----~ Ml + 3 \"~ H2 (g) + M2 (reduced) 3680 cm-1 (TPD, Tm= 350) [4] H O O- I % / C H C /..% [ I O O O O \\/ I I M1 + M2 ~ M+ + H2 + M2 (reduced) 3680 cm-! [5] It has been shown previously [4] that the unidentate carbonate species is decom- posed into carbon dioxide above 350 on ZnO/ZrO2 aerogel: O O- %C/ I o o CO2 (g) + Mi [6] This last reaction explains the evolution of carbon dioxide in the first process (T~= 350) of the TPD (Fig. 5). The ratio C/H=0.25 which was observed in this process, producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen, is consistent with the initial formation of the formate species [Eq. (4) ] where hydrogen is more abundant that carbon dioxide. However, a fraction of the formate is transformed into the bidentate carbonate [Eq. (5) ] which is in part decomposed [Eq. (6) ] and the ratio CO/H2 increases to 1 at 440 (Table 1). The surface concentration of the non-decomposed formate species can be esti- mated by comparing the balance of carbon and hydrogen of the first peak (Tn~=350). According to the proposed mechanism [Eqs. (4) to (6)] every carbon dioxide formed (45 /xmol/g) should be associated with the evolution of 2.5 H2 (or 112 /xmol/g). If this amount is subtracted from the total amount of hydrogen detected in the first peak ( 180/xmol/g) the concentration of the formate species still present on the surface is (180- 112) ~ =45/zmol/g. This formate species is decomposed into carbon monoxide during the second process of the TPD at Tm = 440 where carbon dioxide is not released (Table 1 ). It was shown previously [2], however, that when the formate species is produced on ZnO/ZrO2 D. Bianchi et al. )'Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-1 lO 105 aerogel by adsorption of carbon monoxide (above 25) it is decomposed during the TPD experiment according to two mechanisms [ Eq. (3) ] : with production of carbon monoxide (route [2] ) or of carbon dioxide (route [ 1] ). The production of carbon monoxide is favoured on a reduced surface [2]. The decomposition of the formate species generated from the methoxy groups produces only carbon monoxide at Tm=440 (no carbon dioxide evolved) because the surface is reduced according to Eqs. (4) and (5). The second process of the TPD at Tm= 440 may be thus globally summarized as follows: H I c /...,\\ o o o \\ / II 2 Mi ~ 2CO(g) + Ml + MI (reduced) + H20 (g) This decomposition contributes to the production of 45/xmol/g of carbon mon- oxide (total CO= 180 /~mol/g at Tm=440). The difference 180-45= 135 /.Lmol/g of carbon monoxide must be produced by the decomposition of other adsorbed species, essentially the methoxy groups: CH3 I O I 3 M ~ CO (g) + .~ H2(g)+ M(reduced) The very minor process of methane formation at Tm = 440 probably follows the mechanism already envisaged for pure ZrO2. The Tm temperatures of the formation of methane are very similar for both catalysts, ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2. It is thus probable that the production of methane is correlated with ZrO2 and not with ZnO. Similar experiments performed on pure ZnO [ 13] confirm that methane is not produced after adsorption of methanol on this oxide. 3.3. Interaction of methanol with copper-containing catalysts.\" CuO/Zr02 and CuO/ZnO/Zr02 Transient methods CuO,/Zr02 The results of the TPD experiments of methanol adsorbed at 25 (210 ~mol/ g) are less complex than those registered on copperless catalysts, ZrO2 and ZnO/ ZrO2, where the amounts of adsorbed methanol were also higher (Table 1 ). Only one major decomposition process is observed at Tm = 320 with the production of only four gases: carbon monoxide (8 /~mol/g), carbon dioxide (110/~mol/g), hydrogen (4 ~mol/g) and water (290/~mol/g, between 320 and 650) in addition 106 D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 8~110 to the desorption of methanol (70/xmol/g) in four peaks at Tin=210, 310, 330 and 380 (Table 1). No DME and HCOOH are detected, in contrast to the behaviour of pure ZrO2. Also the temperature T,n = 320 of the peak of the decom- position of the adsorbed species is much lower than on pure ZrO2 (T,n = 570) and water is not detected during the isothermal adsorption of methanol at 25, in contrast to the behaviour of pure ZrO> It may also be deduced that because of the presence of CuO only a very limited amount of hydrogen is produced (4/zmol/g) and water is evolved instead (290/xmol/g) by decomposition of adsorbed meth- anol. CuO/ZnO/Zr0 2 This copper-containing aerogel adsorbs at 25 more methanol (290 ~mol/g) than the previous binary aerogel CuO / ZrO2 ( 210 ~mol / g) ( Table 1 ). The addition of ZnO to CuO/ZrO2 is therefore beneficial for the adsorption of methanol. The TPD spectrum of adsorbed methanol shows its desorption (135/zmol/g) in four superimposed peaks at Tm= 120, 190, 240 and 300 (Table 1). The methanol which remains adsorbed (290- 135 = 155 /xmol/g) is decomposed in only one process at Tm= 350 with the production of carbon monoxide (10 /zmol/g), carbon dioxide (130 /zmol/g) and hydrogen (45 /zmol/g) (Table l). A large production of water is also registered ( 250/~mol/g) starting at 400, but methane, DME and HCOOH are not evolved, similarly as for the binary catalyst CuO/ZrO2 (figure not shown). FT-IR spectroscopy The adsorption of methanol ( 135 Torr in helium flow) at 25 gives the same results on both copper-containing catalysts. The difference with the spectra obtained on copperless catalysts consists in the band of the hydroxyl groups at 3780 cm- which is practically not modified with respect to that of the initial solid (spectrum not shown) whereas the intensity of the second band of the hydroxyl groups at 3680 cm i tends even to increase as a result of methanol adsorption. It may be recalled that on copperless catalysts (see above) the equivalent band of hydroxyl groups, at 3770 cm l [ 1 ], almost disappeared by adsorption of methanol. A large band centred at 3400 cm- J accounts for the interaction between the hydroxyl groups after adsorption of methanol on copper-containing catalysts. The bands due to the methoxy groups, at 2930, 2825, 1460, 1440 and 1144 cm l are now well apparent. The bands at 1570, 1382 and 1370 cm-~ of the formate species are much better defined that on copperless catalysts. The bands of unidentate carbonate species, at 1440 and 1340 cm-~ are also observed after adsorption of methanol at 25, whereas they were not observed under these conditions on copperless catalysts. During the TPD of adsorbed methanol the bands of the methoxy groups vanish around 200, whereas the bands of the formate species as well as those of the unidentate carbonate species simultaneously increase in intensity. A temperature above 270 was required to observe this phenomenon on copperless catalysts. D. Bianchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 107 New bands at 1416 cm- ~ due to the carboxylate species and at 1440 cm- 1 due to the ionic carbonate species are also well detected (see Table l of ref. [2] ) during this TPD process of adsorbed methanol on copper-containing catalysts, whereas they were absent on copperless catalysts. A decrease of the transmission shows the reduction of the catalyst. The results of the TPD experiments after adsorption of methanol at 25 on copper-containing aerogels CuO / ZrO2 and CuO / ZnO / ZrO2 show that, besides the desorption of non-decomposed methanol, only one major process of decomposition takes place, with the production of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water and of a small amount of hydrogen. The Tm temperatures of this phenomenon are 320 for CuO/ZrO2 and 350 for CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 (Table 1 ). For copperless aerogels a second decomposition process of adsorbed methanol was observed at higher temperatures. The IR study of the adsorbed species gives information on these differences. Methanol is adsorbed at 25 on two copper-containing solids essen- tially in the form of methoxy groups. Small amounts of the formate species and of the unidentate carbonate species are much more apparent than on copperless cata- lysts. The methoxy groups vanish during the TPD process around 200 whereas on copperless catalysts they are stable up to 350. This transformation of the methoxy groups, already at 200, on copper-containing catalysts generates new quantities of the formate and unidentate carbonate species and also new species such as carboxylate and ionic carbonate. The behaviour of the hydroxyl groups during the adsorption of methanol is also different on both series of solids. On copperless catalysts the intensity of the band at 3770 cm - 1 of these groups decreases very much after adsorption of methanol at 25, whereas both bands, at 3770 and 3680 cm- 1, decrease considerably at 250. On copper-containing catalysts the intensity of the bands of the hydroxyl groups remains almost constant under these conditions. Moreover, a large but definite band at 3400 cm ~ accounts for the interaction between the hydroxyl groups but the band of the adsorbed water, at 1635 cm- ~, is not formed. Hence the mechanisms which control the adsorption and the decomposition of methanol are different on both series of solids. The consumption of the hydroxyl groups by methanol, giving various reaction products (CO2, CH4, H2) detailed previously for the copperless catalysts (Table 1 ), is not recorded for the second class of solids, containing copper.

Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-110 [ 1 ] generated by the decomposition of methanol. This hydrogen is released into the gas phase (Table 1 ) on copperless catalysts. On copper-containing solids only one decomposition process during the TPD occurs at Tm = 320 for CuO/ZrO2 and at Tm = 350 for CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 and this produces mainly carbon dioxide with only moderate amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The IR analysis demonstrates the transformation of the methoxy groups into the formate and car- bonate type species. The decomposition at 320 or 350 concerns therefore not the initial methoxy groups but these new species formed from the methoxy groups. On copperless catalysts the transformation of the methoxy groups, at higher tempera- tures, into the formate and carbonate type species is accompanied by an important release of H2(g). The storage of hydrogen in the form of hydroxyl groups is less efficient on these catalysts [ 1 ] and H2(g) is evolved, whereas the intensity of the OH bands decreases. If the transformation methoxy ~ formate -~ carbonate produces hydrogen in excess, which cannot be stored on copper-containing cata- lysts, this hydrogen is not released but probably reduces CuO. The water formed is desorbed only above 300 (Table 1 ). This process may be represented as follows: H I CH3 C I /.-.x, O O O O I II \\ / MI + M2 ~ M1 + H2(g) + M2(reduced) (no consumption of OH's) O II M3 + H2 ~ M3 (reduced) + H20 (ads) (M30 = CuO) These reactions are observed at low temperature on copper-containing catalysts, hence M20 also represents CuO. Similarly, the decomposition of the formate species and its transformation into the carbonate species follows a mechanism which is also different from that previously envisaged for the copperless catalysts, because the intensities of the hydroxyl groups are not reduced: H I O%C/U C /..x I 0 0 0 N/ I 2Ml + 3M20 ~ 2M1++ 3M2(reduced) + H20(ads) However, all the formate species are not transformed into the carbonate type species on copper-containing solids. The remaining formate is decomposed at Tm = 320 and 350, respectively for CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2, into carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen or water, according to two paths of Eq. (3) discussed previously [ 2,3 ]. D. Bianchi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89 110 109 A small amount of carbon monoxide [path (2) ] is released (8 and 10/xmol/g, respectively, Table 1 ) because carbon monoxide may be consumed in the reduction of CuO. Hydrogen formed in path (1) similarly contributes to the reduction of CuO and is partially consumed in the storage as OH's. The proportion of CuO reduced during various processes of the methanol decom- position may be calculated from the oxygen balance during the TPD experiment. For the CuO/ZrO2 catalyst the 140/xmol / g of methanol remaining adsorbed (Table 1 ) contribute 140/xmol/g of oxygen. Now 290/xmol/g of water were detected by TPD but about 15/xmol/g of water may be due to the ultimate dehydroxylation of the catalyst [ 1,3]. The final figure is therefore 275/xmol/g of water or 275/xatom/ g of oxygen. Besides, 110/xmol/g of carbon dioxide evolved (Table 1) represent 220/xatom/g of oxygen and 8/xmol/g of carbon monoxide correspond to 8 k~atom/ g of oxygen. The total figure for oxygen evolved in TPD is therefore 275 + 220 + 8 = 503 /zatom/g. For the catalyst CuO/ZrO> methanol contributes for only 140 /xatom/g of oxygen (see above). The missing amount of oxygen (503 - 140 = 363/xatom/g) can only come from copper oxide (5% in the catalyst) which is initially present in an amount of 610/xmol/g. The oxygen eliminated as water and carbon oxides corresponds then to the reduction of 59% of the CuO. The same type of calculation for the ternary catalyst CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 results in the reduction of 58% of CuO. If ZnO is reduced to some extent this proportion would be lower. The progressive oxidation of the methoxy groups on copper-containing catalysts involves thus the absence of the consumption of the hydroxyl groups (which at high temperatures are finally eliminated as water) and the intermediate formation of species like formate and then unidentate carbonate, in the schemes developed above. In contrast to the case for copperless catalysts, hydrogen is not released but remains stored in the form of OH's. These hydroxyl groups [ l ] account for the transformation of the methoxy groups (by loss of hydrogen) into the formate and carbonate species at temperatures much lower than for copperless catalysts [Eqs. (4) and (5)]. The final argument in favour of the spillover of hydrogen on copper-containing solids may be found in the absence of the formation of methane during the TPD experiments on these catalysts, in contrast to the formation of methane on both copperless catalysts (see above). Methane can be formed by the reduction of the methoxy groups localized on zirconia for all classes of catalysts (see above). If, on the contrary, these groups can lose hydrogen by the (reverse) spillover [8] through copper ions, this hydrogen being stored as OH's, they are easily transformed into formate and finally carbonate species and methane cannot be evolved instead. The extensive coverage of ZrO2 by CuO in both copper-containing catalysts [ 3] is in favour of this spillover phenomenon. In the reverse process, i.e. that of the synthesis of methanol from the reactants (CO, CO2, H2), it is not surprising that, assuming the forward spillover [ 1,2] of hydrogen and of carbon monoxide from copper onto zirconia, the catalysts con- 110 D. Bianchi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 89-1 lO taining copper should be more active than the copperless catalysts. This was estab- lished in the previous paper [ 19]. Methanol formed is more easily desorbed from the ternary catalyst (Table 1) whereas the decomposition process requires higher temperatures for copperless catalysts (Table 1). In contrast, lower temperatures are required for the transformation of the methoxy groups into formate and carbon- ate species on copper-containing catalysts (Table 1 ). The reversal of this process in the presence of hydrogen (conditions for synthesis) would also explain higher activity of catalysts in the presence of copper. This problem, together with the nature of the pivotal species, formate and/or carbonate, is the subject of the forth- coming paper. References [ 1 ] D. Bianchi, J.L. Gass, M. Khalfallah and S.J.

Less methanol is being adsorbed at 25°C, and decomposed during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) on copper-containing catalysts CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 than on the copperless catalysts ZrO2 and ZnO/ZrO2. On this last class of solids the concentration of hydroxyl groups decreases by adsorption of methanol whereas the reverse is observed on copper-containing catalysts, where also lower temperatures are required for the transformation of the methoxy groups into more oxidized species such as formate and carbonates. The influence of copper on these processes is explained by the spillover of hydrogen, through copper ions, from the methoxy groups to oxygen ions of zirconia.
