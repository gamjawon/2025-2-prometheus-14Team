Graphical abstract Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a sustainable and promising strategy for the conversion of N2 into NH3. However, electrocatalytic NRR is vitally dependent on metal-based catalysts, and it remains a huge challenge in achieving effective NRR on metal-free catalysts. Here we report that O-doped graphdiyne (GDY) as a metal-free NRR electrocatalyst in aqueous solution. O doping in the GDY results in the redistribution of electron density, where the sp-C atom nearest to the O atom provides enhanced capture to N2 molecules. The influence of surface strain on the progression of NRR on O-doped GDY surface has been investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation method. The DFT calculations predict that the potential-limiting steps (PLS) do not vary with the strain, which is *NHNH2→*NH2NH2 for alternating mechanism and *NH2→*NH3 for distal mechanism under the strain range of -1%∼ +5%; the limiting potentials of alternating mechanism is higher than that of distal mechanism; the limiting potentials of two mechanisms decrease with the tensile strain. It can be inferred that the NRR activity increases with a tensile strain of 0%∼ +5%. Our study not only gets deep insights into the catalytic activity of O-doped GDY but also highlights the significance of strain engineering for catalyst design. Keywords Graphdiyne O-doped Metal-free catalyst Nitrogen reduction reaction Strain engineering Introduction Both the water cycle and the carbon cycle are important energy cycle in nature [1] and successfully applied in various advanced energy conversion systems [2]. Beyond these two cycles, the nitrogen cycle is also crucial in energy cycle [3] and having attracted increasingly extensive attention [4]. Ammonia (NH3) is a highly produced compound [5], a safer energy carrier compared to hydrogen [6], and an important carbon-free energy storage intermediate [7], which is playing an increasingly important role in the sustainable energy era [8]. However, the well-established method of NH3 synthesis is the Haber-Bosch process [9], which is an energy-intensive industry [10]. Indeed, the conversion of N2 into NH3 through the Haber-Bosch process consumes 1%–2% of the world’s annual energy supply [8], which leads to greenhouse effect and serious environmental concerns [5,11]. As an alternative technology, electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− →2NH3) could realize low-cost artificial nitrogen fixation [12] and offer relatively high efficiency with assisted proton at ambient conditions [13]. More excitingly, the NRR device could easily integrate with solar energy [14], and wind energy [15] into a green process for NH3 [16,17]. Thus, the development of high-performance, low-cost and environmentally benign electrocatalyst has become a significant endeavor to reduce N2 into NH3 [5]. Toward this purpose, many researchers have devoted to developing electrocatalysts for realizing efficient NRR at ambient conditions [3,18]. Currently, more and more metal-based materials have been reported as effective NRR catalysts from both experimentally and theoretically. Ru nanoparticles grown on a carbon fiber paper as a NRR electrocatalyst could achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 5.4% at 10 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) [19]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that Pd could absorb H atoms in its lattice and then forms α-phase Pd hydride, which reduces the free energy barrier of the reaction N2 +H→*NNH [20]. The carbon black-supported palladium nanoparticles shows an FE of 8.2% at 0.1 V vs. RHE [20].The flower-like Au microstructure catalysts endow an FE of 6.05% at −0.2 V vs. RHE [21]. Transition metal oxides, including Cr2O3 [22], MoO3 [23], and Nb2O5 [24], have been reported as efficient NRR electrocatalysts. However, Fe-based electrocatalysts (such as Fe, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3/carbon nanotubes) [25] have drawn wide attention, science the NRR was achieved on nano-Fe2O3 [26]. The NRR on transition metal nitride surfaces is believed more active than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with pure metal and follows a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [27]. ZrN, NbN, CrN, and VN are the most promising NRR candidates and have smaller overpotentials of −0.50 V∼ −0.80 V [28]. The existing results indicated that MXenes among transition metal carbides were promising NRR catalysts [29]. For instance, the V3C2 have low overpotentials of 0.64 V vs. SHE (standard hydrogen electrode). Compared with metal-based electrocatalysts, metal-free catalysts are highly promising alternatives for NRR [5]. Metal-free electrocatalysts have been attracting increasingly tremendous interest for various electrochemical reaction due to their economic viability, controllable composition, high-temperature stability, environment-friendly and non-corrosive nature, and unique physicochemical properties [1,30,31]. For instance, boron-doped graphene endows an NH3 production rate of 9.8 μg h−1 mg−1 and an FE of 10.8% at 0.5 V vs. RHE. DFT calculations suggested that BC3 structures serve as active sites for NRR [32]. Experiments combined with DFT calculations suggested pyridinic- and pyrroliC–N are active sites for NRR, and their contents exhibit great effect on the synthesis of NH3 [33]. DFT calculations revealed that single boron-interstitial doped C2N (B/C2N) monolayer could effectively achieve NRR with a low onset potential of 0.18 eV [34]. More importantly, B/C2N could harvest the light in the visible and infra-red regions, which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency [17]. Du et al. also reported that the incorporation of single B atom onto g-C3N4 (B/g-C3N4) is a very compelling photocatalyst for NRR [14]. Song et al. represented the N, P co-doped porous carbon catalyst (NP-C-MOF-5) fabricated by metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the template is available to the electrocatalytic reduction of N2 gas in acid electrolytes with two products including NH3 and N2H4·H2O [35]. N-doped carbon nanospikes could get an FE of 11.56% at −1.19 V vs. RHE and a production rate of 97.18 mg h−1 cm-2 [36]. B4C (110) surface could achieve a NH3 yield of 26.57 μg h−1 mg−1 and an FE of 15.95% at −0.75 V vs. RHE [37]. Graphdiyne (GDY) is a new two-dimensional (2D) material that contains sp 2- and sp-C atoms [38] and can be synthesized in a moderate condition in the liquid phase [39]. GDY exhibits a increasingly strong application prospect in energy conversion systems [40,41]. Heteroatom doping is an effective strategy for electrocatalytic activity enhancement [5,42]. N-doped GDY structures achieve much better electrocatalytic character for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [43,44], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [45] and CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) [46]. B-doped GDY systems possess excellent electrocatalytic activity for the conversion of CO2 to CH4 and C2H4 [46]. GDY co-doped with sp-N and S exhibits better OER performance than commercial RuO2 [47]. Strain engineering is another strategy to further enhance the catalytic activities [1], which can tailor the electronic structure via altering the atomic spacing and the bond length [48]. Strain engineering has been successful to optimize the electrocatalytic performance of nano-structures for HER [49], ORR [50], OER [51], CRR [52] and O2 dissociation [53]. However, the strain effect on NRR of metal-free catalysts has still not been reported. In this work, single heteroatom doped GDY monolayers were applied for NRR by employing firstly-principles calculation. Firstly, the adsorption and activation of N2 on these doped GDY catalysts were investigated. Moreover, the dissociative and associative mechanisms of NRR were discussed in detail from the viewpoints of kinetics and thermodynamics. Finally, the strain effect on NRR catalytic performance was estimated. The computations revealed that O-doped GDY monolayer is a promising NRR metal-free electrocatalyst, and the NRR activity increases with a tensile strain of 0%∼ +5%. Computational details All the first-principles spin-polarized calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [54]. The ion-electron interactions were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [55]. The PBE-D3 method with the semiempirical Grimme parameter was taken into account to describe the dispersion effects [56,57], which has been extensively used to study 2D materials. The cutoff energy of 500 eV was used. A vacuum space of 15 Å was imposed during all calculations. To find the minimum energy path for the reactions, the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was employed [58]. The spring constant between adjacent images was −5.0 eV Å−2. For all pathways, the activation barriers (E b) and reaction energies (ΔH) were evaluated as follows: E b = E TS − E IS and ΔH = E FS − E IS, where IS, TS, and FS correspond to initial state, transition state, and final state, respectively. The adsorption energy (Eads ) of NRR species on doped GDY monolayer was computed by the following relation. (1) E a d s = E a d s o r b a t e + s u b − E a d s o r b a t e − E d o p e d − G D Y Where Eadsorbate+sub , Eadsorbate , and Edoped-GDY are the total energies of the adsorbate- catalyst, the isolated adsorbate, and the doped GDY monolayer, respectively. Thus, a negative Eads indicates exothermic adsorption. VASPsol code was employed to simulate the solvation effect, [59,60] which is considered as an implicit solvation model with the dielectrics constant of 80 for H2O solvent [61]. The change in free energy (ΔG) was considered the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model originated by Norskov et al. [62] and given by the following equation. (2) Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E − T Δ S + Δ G U + Δ G p H + Δ G f i e l d Where, ΔE is the total energy difference that can be obtained from the DFT calculations. ΔZPE and TΔS are the contributions of the zero-point energy difference and entropy difference at temperature (T = 298.15 K), respectively. ΔG U = eU, where U is the electrode potential concerning SHE, and e is the transferred charge. ΔG pH = k B T × ln 10 × pH, where pH = 0 in this study. ΔG field is the free-energy correction, which is neglected in the present study. The entropies and vibrational frequencies of the molecules (including N2, H2, NH3, etc.) in the gas phase are taken from the NIST database [63]. Zero-point energy corrections and entropic contributions to the free energies of the adsorbed species on doped GDY estimated from the vibrational frequencies are given in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Results and discussion N2 adsorption The adsorption of N2 molecule is a crucial step to stimulate electrochemical NRR [64]. The adsorption of N2 molecule on pristine GDY was firstly investigated (Fig. S1a). The calculated adsorption energy is −0.07 eV, the distance between the N2 molecule and the pristine GDY surface is 2.97 Å, and the corresponding NN bond length is the same as that of isolated N2 molecule (1.11 Å) [17], which indicates GDY monolayer is not a good NRR catalyst (Figs. S1-3 and Note S1). To improve the NRR catalytic character of GDY based materials, three nonmetallic elements (B, N and O) were selected to dope GDY monolayer to obtain single atom doped GDY monolayers. The formation energies of each heteroatom doped GDY were calculated via the equation: E for = E d-GDY −E GDY + E C−E X, where E d-GDY, E GDY, E C and E X are the total energy of the doped GDY, pristine GDY, the energy of atomic C, and the energy of atomic B, N, or O, respectively. The calculated formation energies of different doped GDY (Fig. 1 g) indicated that N and O prefer to substitute C1 atom (X-1 GDY) (Fig. S4), and B prefers to substitute Cb atom (X-b GDY) (Fig. 1a), which is in line with previous calculations [65]. Then, the adsorption of N2 molecule on various optimized doped GDY surfaces was evaluated with different configurations and adsorption sites. The optimized configurations and corresponding geometric parameters, such as the adsorption energy [E ads (*N2)], charge transfer [Q(*N2)], the distance (D N2-GDY) between N2 molecule and different GDY systems, and the bond length of NN (L N-N) are illustrated in Fig. S5 and Fig. 1h. For B-b and N-1 doped GDY, these sheets maintain planar structures, the adsorption energies [E ads (*N2)] are less than −0.10 eV, and distance between the N2 molecule and doped GDY sheets are around 3.28–3.39 Å, all which indicates that the N2 molecules are physisorbed on B-b and N-1 doped GDY monolayers. The bader charge analysis and the length of NN confirm that B-b and N-1 doped GDY cannot capture N2 efficiently (Fig. 1h). While in terms of O-doped GDY, the N2 molecule is adsorbed to the C2 atom with the end-on mode (Fig. 1e), the bond length of C–N is 1.31 Å, and the E ads is −0.98 eV. Moreover, the length of NN bonds increases from 1.11 Å (gas) to 1.16 Å. Further charge density differences (CDD) between N2 and O-doped GDY based on Bader charge analysis shows that 0.41 e have been transferred from O-doped GDY to the N2 molecule (Fig. 1f). These results illustrated that the inert NN triple bonds could be activated on O-doped GDY catalyst. To get further insight into the adsorption of N2 molecule on O-doped GDY, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of O-doped GDY and N2/O-doped GDY were calculated and exhibited in Fig. 1i. The pristine GDY shows semiconductor characteristics [65], while the O-doped GDY exhibits metallic character and has magnetic ground states (Fig. S6). When the O-doped GDY captures a N2 molecule, electrons fill the 1π* orbit of the N2 gas. The strength and shape of the occupied 2σ* 1π and unoccupied 1π* orbitals of N2 molecule have changed dramatically, while the shape of the 3σ orbital of N2 molecule almost remaining unchanged [34]. The hybridization between the O, C2 atom and N2 molecule orbits is observed from the PDOS and local DOS (LDOS) nearby the Fermi level. The charge transfer from O-doped GDY to the adsorbed N2 molecule leads to charge redistribution. The N1 atom gets 0.52 e while N2 atom loses 0.11 e [14]. Therefore the repulsive interaction between the two N atoms elongates the NN triple bond to 1.16 Å. NRR on O-doped GDY The NRR can be categorized into dissociative and associative mechanisms, [12] as shown in Fig. 2 . For the dissociative mechanism, the NN of the N2 molecules firstly undergo a cleavage, leave two adsorbed N-atoms on the catalyst surface. In comparison, the NN is not broken until each N atom undergoes hydrogenation for the associative mechanism. The associative mechanism also can be divided into alternating pathway and distal pathway. The proton-electron pairs (H+ + e−) attack the two N atoms alternatively on the catalyst surface, which is defined as associative alternating pathway. While for the associative distal pathway, hydrogenation occurs preferentially on the distal N atom, then release the distal NH3 molecule, and finally produce the second NH3 molecule [64]. We discuss these two mechanisms separately in the following. Fig. 3 shows *N2→*N+*N dissociation reactions on O-doped GDY sheet. The NN bond lengths of IS, TS, and FS are 1.16 Å, 1.67 Å, and 2.91 Å, respectively. The reaction requires to overcome a very high energy barrier (E b) of 3.95 eV and is an endothermic process with large reaction energy (ΔH) of 2.16 eV, indicates that direct dissociation of N2 into two separated N atoms on O-doped GDY monolayer is still hard to occur [66]. In the following, the N2 associative pathway is selected to further study and discuss in detail. The H atoms are added to the adsorbed species one-by-one along with alternating and distal mechanisms. The stable reaction intermediates configurations and the calculated geometric parameters on O-doped GDY are presented in Fig. 4 . Their adsorption energies and Bader charge transfer are listed in Table 1 . The reaction intermediates preferred to bind to the C2 atom of the O-doped GDY, which indicates that the C2 atom is active site. Based on Bader charge analysis, C2 atom lost 0.67–1.14 e, which promotes binding to reaction species [67]. Fig. 4a shows that 0.41 e transfer from the O-doped GDY surface to the *N2, which elongates NN bond. *NNH gains more charge transfer than *N2 (0.54 vs. 0.41 e) (Fig. 4b), the NN bond is elongated to 1.29 Å. The NN bond lengths of *NHNH, *NHNH2 and *NH2NH2 are 1.31 Å, 1.39 Å, and 1.49 Å, respectively (Fig. 4c–e). For *NH2NH3, the NN distance is up to 3.69 Å, which illustrates that NN bond is completely dissociated, then the NH3 is formed. For *NNH2, *NNH3, and *NHNH3, the NN bond length are 1.35 Å, 1.46 Å, and 3.30 Å, respectively (Fig. 4g–i). The *NNH3→*N + NH3 dissociation pathway was evaluated by CI-NEB method, and the energy barrier is up to 4.31 eV (Fig. 5 ) [66,68]. In comparison, the NH3 is not formed from *NNH3 but *NHNH3. Thus, the reaction *NNH3+H→*NH + NH3 is selected in the associative distal pathway in this work (Fig. 2). For *NH, *NH2, and *NH3 (Fig. 4j–l), the NC bond lengths are 1.27 Å, 1.37 Å, and 1.51 Å, respectively. The corresponding adsorption energies are decreased (−6.80 eV for *NH, −5.14 eV for *NH2, and −1.85 eV for *NH3) with the charge transfer decreasing (0.63 e, 0.30 e and 0.25 e). Besides, the total magnetic moments are different with different absorbed reaction species. Free-energy diagrams for NRR through alternating and distal mechanisms on O-doped GDY are depicted in Fig. 6 . At the electric potential of 0.00 V, the N2+*→*N2 is downhill by 0.72 eV, indicating that O-doped GDY captures N2 efficiently. The next reaction *N2+H→*NNH has a small uphill of 0.23 eV. In the following hydrogenation, formed *NHNH is downhill by 0.91 eV, while formed *NNH2 is downhill by 1.14 eV. For alternating mechanisms (Fig. 6a), the free energy of *NHNH reduction to *NHNH2 is downhill of 0.44 eV. The subsequent reaction needs the highest uphill energy of 0.75 eV to form *NH2NH2, which is the potential-limiting step (PLS). Then the first NH3 is generated (Fig. 4f) with about 2.69 eV reaction energy released. The reaction *NH2+ H→*NH3 has a free energy uphill of 0.67 eV. The NH3 can leave from the sheet with about 1.83 eV reaction energy absorbed. For alternating mechanisms (Fig. 6b), the reaction *NH2+ H→*NH3 has the largest Gibbs free energy barrier of 0.67 eV, which is PLS. To gain insight into the catalytic performance of O-doped GDY, the charge transfer based on Bader charge analysis and NN distances for each species along alternating and distal pathways are further explored and presented in Fig. 6c–f. For O-doped GDY, the C2 atom loses 0.50 e, while the O atom gains 0.97 e, for the electronegativity of O (3.50) is bigger than that of carbon (2.55) [1]. The C2 atom nearest the doped O atom always loses electrons in both pathways and remains positively charged. While the doped O atom always gains electrons and keeps negatively charged. Thus C2 atoms serve as active sites for catalyzing NRR on O-doped GDY, which is similar to sp-N doped GDY [61]. The C2 atom could act as a transmitter to transport electrons. The doped O atom may serve as an electron reservoir. The cooperative action between the C2 atom and doped O atom contributes to efficient catalytic properties. The NN bond has been broken for NH2NH3 and NHNH3 with the distances of 3.69 Å and 3.30 Å, respectively (Fig. 6e and f). The NN distance from N2 gas to NH2NH2 for alternating and NNH3 for distal pathways, present nearly linear increase, which can be expressed as y = 0.72x + 1.04 for alternating pathway and y = 0.58x + 1.09 for distal pathway [66]. The increasing linear relationships indicate that O-doped GDY could be a promising NRR catalyst [69]. Strain effect on NRR Surface strain could alter the electronic structures of materials, and more and more results have demonstrated the possibility of optimizing electrocatalytic performance with this strategy [48]. Strain engineering has shown great potential to boost the catalytic properties of many reactions [5], such as ORR, OER, HER, CO2 reduction, and so on [1]. In this section, the effects of strain on the catalytic proprieties and electronic structures of O-doped GDY were comparatively investigated. The biaxial strain is defined by ε=Δc/c 0, where the lattice constants of the unstrained and strained super-cell are c 0 and c=c 0 ± Δc, respectively. Specifically, +ε and -ε represent the tensile strain and compressive strain, respectively [70]. Fig. 7 shows the free-energy diagrams for NRR on O-doped GDY via alternating and distal pathways, and its variation with biaxial strain (Fig. S7). The alternating mechanism was firstly studied, and the free-energy diagram with the applied potential of 0.00 V is shown in Fig. 7a. It is clear that both compressive strain and tensile strain raise the free energy of the NRR species. The strain does not effect on PLS, which is *NHNH2→*NH2NH2. Fig. 7c shows that the limiting potentials (U L) are −0.65 V for +5%, −0.66 V for +4%, −0.71 V for +2%, −0.74 V for +1%, −0.75 V for 0% and −0.77 V for −1%, respectively. By employing the limiting potentials for every strain case, the free energy uphill could be eliminated; the NRR steps could occur spontaneously. Fig. 7b and d shows the free energy diagrams of the distal mechanism on O-doped GDY with the strain range of −1%∼+5%, which are similar to that of alternating mechanism. The strain does not change the PLS, which remains to be *NH2→*NH3. In addition, we also study greater compressive and tensile strains, but the results are unsatisfactory. When the tensile surface strain is greater than +5% (+6% see Fig. S8), the chemisorption of reaction intermediates can lead to the cleavage of the carbon chains. If the compressive surface strain is larger than -1%, a five-ring structure containing four C atoms and one O atom is formed (−1.25% ∼ −1.5% see Fig. S9). The O-doped GDY surface with a strain of -1.5% does not capture N2 molecules effectively (Fig. S10), the distance between GDY surface and N2 molecule is larger than 3.24 Å, and the adsorption energy of N2 is smaller than -0.08 eV. The free energy diagrams show a similar case to that of pristine GDY (Fig. S7 m, n), the first step capturing N2 is an endothermic process with large reaction energy of 1.47 eV. Thus, these cases with tensile strain range +5∼-1% are analyzed in detail in the following. To learn more the effect of strain on the catalytic performance of O-doped GDY, we summarize the limiting potentials via alternating and distal mechanisms under various strains in Fig. 8 . The PLS do not vary with the strain, which is *NHNH2→*NH2NH2 for the alternating mechanism and *NH2→*NH3 for the distal mechanism under the strain range of -1%∼+5%. It should be noted that the limiting potentials of the alternating mechanism are higher than that of the distal mechanism. Fig. 8b shows an obvious linear correlation (y = −0.021x + 0.752) between the limiting potentials of alternating mechanism and strain (−1%∼+5%). The limiting potentials of alternating mechanism increase with compressive strain and decrease with tensile strain. For the case of distal mechanism, the limiting potentials are equal to −0.67 V under the strain of -1%, 0%, and +1%. However, the data of limiting potentials vs. strain (+1%∼+5%) provides an obvious linear correlation (y = −0.025x + 0.697). In other word, the NRR activity increases with tensile strain. These results are consistent with ORR [71] and HER [72]. To find the electronic origin of strain effect on the catalytic properties of O-doped GDY, the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of O atom and C2 atom of O-doped GDY were calculated and exhibited in Fig. 9 . It is clear that from Fig. 9a the spin-polarized TDOS of O-doped GDY is asymmetric, and the total magnetic moment of O-doped GDY are various with the strain (Fig. S6 and Table S2). As shown in Fig. 9b, the spin polarization mainly originates from p orbital of the C2 atom for unstrained O-doped GDY, while from s and p orbital of the C2 atom for strained O-doped GDY surfaces, which may indicates that the s state of C2 atom plays an critical role in the modulation of catalytic character. As for Fig. 9c, the p orbital of the O atom mainly contributes the spin polarization. It is noted that the DOS peak at −1.24 eV on the unstrained O-doped GDY surface would upshift to −0.78 eV for +5%, −0.89 eV for +4%, −1.06 eV for +2%, −1.14 eV for +1% and −1.06 eV for -1% strained surfaces, respectively. The DOS peaks are located different sites results from the charge transfer with various strain [73]. As shown in Fig. 9d, the C2 atom gains electrons, while the doped O atom loses electrons. We can see that both the gained electrons of the C2 atom and the lost electrons of O atom decrease with tensile strain, which is in agreement with the DOS. Conclusions In this paper, we have studied the NRR performance of single-heteroatom-doped GDY monolayers. From the calculations, only the O-doped GDY can effectively capture N2 molecules, activate NN bonds, and is quite a promising metal-free catalyst for NRR. The influence of surface strain on the progression of NRR on O-doped GDY surface has been investigated using the DFT calculation method. When the tensile surface strain is greater than +5%, the chemisorption of reaction intermediates can lead to the cleavage of the carbon chains. If the compressive surface strain is larger than −1%, forming a five-ring structure with four C atoms and one O atom, it can lead to poor capture of N2 molecules. For the strain range of −1%∼ +5%, the DFT calculations predict that the PLS do not vary with the strain, which is *NHNH2→*NH2NH2 for alternating mechanism and *NH2→*NH3 for distal mechanism; the limiting potentials of alternating mechanism is higher than that of distal mechanism; the limiting potentials of two mechanisms decrease with tensile strain. It is inferred that the NRR activity increases with a tensile strain of 0%∼ +5%. Our results reveal that the onset potential is 0.57 V for O-doped GDY with a strain of +5% via the distal mechanism. The results not only get deep insights into the NRR catalytic activity of O-doped GDY but also highlight the significance of strain engineering for NRR catalyst design.

        "dc:description": "Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a sustainable and promising strategy for the conversion of N2 into NH3. However, electrocatalytic NRR is vitally dependent on metal-based catalysts, and it remains a huge challenge in achieving effective NRR on metal-free catalysts. Here we report that O-doped graphdiyne (GDY) as a metal-free NRR electrocatalyst in aqueous solution. O doping in the GDY results in the redistribution of electron density, where the sp-C atom nearest to the O atom provides enhanced capture to N2 molecules. The influence of surface strain on the progression of NRR on O-doped GDY surface has been investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation method. The DFT calculations predict that the potential-limiting steps (PLS) do not vary with the strain, which is *NHNH2→*NH2NH2 for alternating mechanism and *NH2→*NH3 for distal mechanism under the strain range of -1%∼ +5%; the limiting potentials of alternating mechanism is higher than that of distal mechanism; the limiting potentials of two mechanisms decrease with the tensile strain. It can be inferred that the NRR activity increases with a tensile strain of 0%∼ +5%. Our study not only gets deep insights into the catalytic activity of O-doped GDY but also highlights the significance of strain engineering for catalyst design.",
