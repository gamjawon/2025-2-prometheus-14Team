Heteroatom-doping introduces various defects in nanocarbons, herein; we reported salt-assisted synthetic strategy by establishing gas-liquid interface during pyrolysis and explored fluorine enrichment effect on mesoporous N-doped nanocarbons. The F, N co-doped carbon (FNC) performs similar to precious electrocatalysts in terms of onset (0.98 V) and half-wave (0.87 V) potentials under alkaline medium and half-wave potential of 0.78 V vs RHE was observed in acidic medium. F-doping also improves the ORR-pathway by yielding less peroxide production of 2% and also showed good stability of 8000 CV cycles than that of Pt/C. This study not only highlights the insights on the correlation of F, N dual doping and their intrinsic activity but also contributes a new strategy for highly efficient metal-free ORR electrocatalyst by in-situ fabrication of N, F co-doped carbon. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Metal-free electrocatalysis Phase-transition F-doping Oxygen reduction reaction Defective sites 1 Introduction Fuel cells and metal-air batteries are intensively studied as a class of energy conversion/ storage devices owing to their excellent performance with higher energy density and eco-friendly behavior. [1-4] Among various electrochemical reactions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) deliberated as a backbone of these devices. [5-8] Due to high cost and scarcity of Pt-group metals (PGM),[9-12] the carbon-based nanomaterials are considered as a choice to replace PGM catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the ORR-pathway. [13-18] The recent development on carbon-based non-precious metal catalysts (NMPC) reduces the usage of noble metals,[19-23] however they comprised of various limitations such as; variation in structure or morphology during long-term aging operation, oxidized in air, less tolerance against environmental poisons, agglomeration and demetalation under strong electrolytes (acid/ base). [24-28] Therefore, it is a need of time to cultivate sustainable electrocatalysts constituting high activity from earth abundant materials. Heteroatom doping in carbon matrix have definite potential as a substitute for metal-based electrocatalysts, owing to multiple advantages, i.e., high electronic conductivity, low cost, strong tolerance to acidic/ alkaline media, structural tunability at the molecular and morphological levels. [29,30] Heteroatoms having electronegativity difference with carbon atoms are usually doped such as; sulfur (S, 2.58), nitrogen (N, 3.04), boron (B, 2.04), phosphorous (P, 2.19), and halogens including; iodine (I, 2.66), bromine (Br, 2.96), chlorine (Cl, 3.16) and fluorine (F, 4.0). [8,31-36] The generation of defects on carbon framework through simple heteroatoms/ molecule doping or heterojunction, serves as active site for electrochemical reaction. In the meantime, the robust influence of charge transfer between heteroatom and the carbon could able to eventually alter the electronic structure, thereby increasing the electrocatalytic activity. [26,37] Although mono-doping (N-doping in C) is considered as an efficient way, [38] however, it could not prove itself to be a strong alternate to commercial Pt/C. [39-41] Furthermore, doping with two or more elements in carbon framework, testified to create synergism between hetero-doped carbon such as P/N, B/N, S/N and F/N. [42] Thus, possibly generated more active species or new non-electroneutral sites in the conjugated carbon backbone for enhancement of catalytic performance. [43] Recently, we have reported well-ordered mesoporous nanocarbon by incorporating heteroatoms with two types (P, N) as an efficient ORR-electrocatalyst. [27,44] In contrast, F atom has higher electronegativity and the smaller atomic size than P atom, which may have embedded easily in the carbon matrixes and produce more defective sites for ORR. [33,37] Additionally, N and F atoms may cause synergetic effect, more polarization in the C-N, C-F and C-C bonds, induce larger interaction among doped carbon surface and O2, which help in promoting the ORR-pathway. [45,46] There are a few studies reporting the effect of fluorine and nitrogen co-doping. The previous doping methods like gaseous F-doping or plasma dissociation (F2, XeF2 and CF4) are very critical and hazardous. [47-49] Further, an improved understanding of how the synthetic procedure alter the catalytic properties has been given rise with both high activity and durability verses previous generation of PGM free catalyst. Meanwhile, introducing porosity at atomic structure is also important to guide catalysts development for ORR. As for this point, the formation of mesopores and macropores are also crucially needed for promoting mass transport during ORR-pathway. Herein, we reported a facile and scalable molten salt-assisted method to synthesize F, N dual doped carbon (FNC) by carbonizing the hybrid mixture of poly-diamino pyridine (PDAP), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) as shown in Scheme 1 . Thermal decomposition of NH4F not only provides in situ F-doping but also improves the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites by facilitating the formation of template-free porous structure through gas evolution. The resulting FNC constitutes enormous amount of edge-defects on the graphitic carbon, which play crucial role for enhancement of catalytic activity. The results indicated outstanding performance of F, N co-doped carbon (FNC) in terms of onset (0.98 V in 0.1 M KOH) and half-wave potentials of 0.87 V and 0.78 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) under alkaline and acidic media respectively, as compared with other non-Pt based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, FNC electrocatalyst displayed long-term stability by retaining its initial performance even after 8000 CV-cycles under alkaline and acidic solutions. 2 Experimental section PDAP and NC-derived from PDAP were synthesized according to previous report. [50] For the synthesis of F@PDAP, 0.5g of PDAP was added in 50 ml of distilled water under sonication for 15 minutes. Then, calculated amount of NH4F with various mass ratios (1:4, 1:6, 1:9) was added into the above solution, symbolized as F@PDAP-1, F@PDAP-2, and F@PDAP-3. The solution was allowed to sonicate for 15 min and placed in oven at 80 ⁰C for 24 h. The as-synthesized samples were pyrolyzed at 1000 ⁰C for 3 hours at a rate of 5 ⁰C/ min under N2 atmosphere to obtained FNC-1, FNC-2, and FNC-3. For the sake of ease, sample FNC-2 was termed as FNC. 3 Result and discussion The basic concept of molten salt-assisted strategy lied on the molten precursor (NH4F), interfacial reaction occurred during the gas-liquid interface process at low temperature. The gas bubbles constituted interconnected porous channels for mass transport in the catalyst. The synthetic process involved three steps, 1) polymerization of diaminopyridine and named as PDAP, 2) loading of NH4F salt in/on the surface of PDAP and named as F@PDAP, 3) pyrolysis of F@PDAP in N2 atmosphere. Firstly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the as-synthesized samples. The SEM images showed that spherical morphology of PDAP almost retained after the loading of salt (F@PDAP), which confirmed the formation of molecular aggregate ( Fig. 1 a-c). On the other hand, the high/ low content of F-doping lead to amalgamated morphology of F@PDAP-1 and F@PDAP-3 samples, indicating the role of optimized F-doping towards inherited spherical structure (Fig. S1a,b). After the pyrolysis ( Fig. 1 c-e), SEM and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images of FNC confirmed the formation of rough surface (porous structure) due to successful implementation of phase-transition process with co-existence of edge defects produced by F, N dual doping which is important for boosting the activity of the electrocatalyst. Moreover, the SEM image of FNC-1 revealed the rough and irregular surface that might be due to inappropriate F-doping whereas the morphology of FNC-3 sample collapsed because of high F-doping (Fig. S1c,d). The N2 sorption isotherm as shown in Fig. 2 a, represented the formation of mesoporous structure with characteristic features of Type IV isotherm. The FNC showed higher BET surface area of 785 m2 g−1 than 654 m2 g−1 for its carbonized parent precursor (NC) prepared via direct pyrolysis, signifying the efficacy of phase-transition method for creating highly porous structure. Additionally, F-, N- co-doping creates more defective sites as compare to single dopant (N) which might be the reason of higher BET surface area. The inset of Fig. 2 a showed the pore size distribution of 2-4 nm which confirmed the formation of mesoporous structure. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis exhibited two obvious peaks, positioned at 2Ɵ value of 22⁰ and 44⁰ as shown in Fig. 2 b. The pattern of peaks distinguished with carbon phase related to (001) and (002) reflections. More importantly, it is observed from the XRD comparative analysis of F, N doped carbons (FNC-1, FNC-2, FNC-3) that the peaks become broader after F-doping due the formation of new phases during phase-transition step ( Fig. 2 b & S2). These consequences revealed that switching the direct pyrolysis of PDAP by interfacial reaction between NH4F and PDAP during phase-transition method greatly affected the structure of carbon matrix. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to evaluate the composition of elements and their bonding structures ( Fig. 2 c-f). The high resolution N1s spectra for NC was deconvoluted into four peaks; positioned at 398 eV, 399.3 eV, 400.5 eV, 403.2 eV, recognized as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and N-oxide species. [51,52] While in case of FNC, the two-fold increase in peak intensities of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N was observed. Additionally, the absence of pyrrolic-N peak in FNC, might be the reason for enhanced catalytic performance. Furthermore, the positive shift of 0.2 eV in binding energy of graphitic-N peak with respect to NC, leads to establish a stabilizing effect in FNC electrocatalyst against oxidation of carbon, important for enhancing the stability of catalysts. The O1s spectrum was fitted with three peaks: OH, C-O-F/ C-O, and C=O. FNC shows analogous pattern of shifting towards higher binding energies. As shown in Fig. 2 f, the F1s spectra comprised of two peaks CF and CF2, positioned at binding energies of 684.7 eV and 688 eV. [37] These consequences confirmed the successful co-doping of F, N atoms that can efficiently alter surficial electronic circumstances of carbon framework, thus play promising part towards boosting the ORR performance. Intensive studies have been carried out on fluorine doping for functionalizing carbon structures, but the lack of reported research available for its ORR application. In this aspect, the ORR electrocatalytic activities of as-synthesized samples were monitored on a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (Fig. S3 and 3). To optimize the F-contents in the as-synthesized electrocatalyst, FNC was prepared by altering the feeding of F-contents with mass ratio of 1:4, 1:6, 1:9 between PDAP and NH4F and termed as FNC-1, FNC-2 (FNC), FNC-3. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the FNC with mass ratio of 1:6 exhibited the higher catalytic activity than NC and Pt/C (20%) by E1/2 difference of 163 mV and 11 mV (all potentials are referred vs. RHE). RRDE measurements also showed much lower production of peroxide% by FNC (2%) than NC (11%) and Pt/C (3%). Thus, indicating that F-doping generates surplus active sites by modifying the electronic structure of carbon matrix, results in efficient ORR-pathway. This role can also be observed from the increased limiting current density from 4.05 mA/ cm2 (NC) to 5.1 mA/ cm2 (FNC). Fig. 3 c shows the Tafel slope calculations for FNC is 76 mV/ dec, closer to Pt/C (78 mV/ dec) while much lower than NC (98 mV dec−1), this means that FNC exhibited the similar performance with respect to Pt/C (20%). Additionally, the electron transfer number calculated for NC, FNC and Pt/C were 3.4, 3.98 and 3.97 ( Fig. 3 d). These results confirming the successful F-doping on NC leads to enhanced performance by 4 e− pathway. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was further monitored to study the ORR reaction kinetics of NC and FNC electrocatalysts, as shown in Fig. S5. The results indicated that the Nyquist plot of FNC exhibited smaller charge transfer resistance than that of NC catalyst, suggesting the faster charge transfer during ORR-pathway. The enhanced performance of FNC catalyst might be attributed to the newly exposed surficial species that offer additional active sites for improved catalytic pathway. Another important factor is the stability of the electrocatalyst ( Fig. 3 e), which was monitored after taking 10,000 CV-cycles in the range of 0.6 - 1.0 V under 0.1 M KOH. The results demonstrated the slight difference in E1/2 of 5 mV by FNC, in contrast the performance loss (∆E1/2 ) of 12 mV was shown by Pt/ C (20%). This is attributed to the influence of F-doping on NC which generates asymmetrical charge distributions and larger polarizations by triggering the neighbor carbon atoms on the defective carbon. [53,54] Thus, the inactive carbon atoms become the active sites with high positive charge and asymmetrical spin densities which may enhance the kinetics of ORR. Moreover, the TEM image was taken to investigate the morphological changes after stability test which indicated that the FNC catalyst reserved its original morphology (Fig. S6). Fig. S4 shows the FNC with different mass ratio, higher catalytic activity was observed by 1:6 which reduces successively by increasing (1:9) and decreasing (1:4) the F-content in terms of E1/2 values of 42 mV and 98 mV. The order of catalytic performance is as follows: FNC-2 > FNC-3 > FNC-1. Thus, suggesting that the F-contents could only be able to maximize the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst up to some specified level of doping while further increasing or decreasing the doping level leads to reduced performance. Because successive increase/ or decrease in doping level will eventually generates higher/ or lower F-doped defected sites which tends to destroy the original sp2 structure of carbon matrix. In addition, the FNC catalyst was further investigated in the acidic electrolyte (0.1 M HClO4) to make it suitable ORR ( Fig. 4 ) catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). As expected, it also showed better performance in acid with the half-wave potential of 0.78 V vs RHE ( Fig. 4 a), which stands out among the previous reported metal-free catalysts (Table S3). Further, the ORR pathway is estimated by using the RRDE test which showed that FNC clearly followed the 4e− mechanism with very low production of peroxide (H2O2) similar to the Pt/C while NC exhibited higher peroxide production ( Fig. 4 b). Thus, confirmed that F-doping into NC greatly altered the ORR mechanism. The stability of the electrocatalyst was monitored ( Fig. 4 c) after taking 8,000 CV-cycles in the range of 0.6 - 1.0 V under 0.1 M HClO4. The results demonstrated the slight difference in E1/2 of 10 mV by FNC, in contrast the performance loss (∆E1/2 ) of 27 mV was shown by Pt/ C (20%). Furthermore, the SEM and TEM images as shown in Figs. S7 & S8 illustrated that catalyst (FNC) retained its structural morphology after the continuous catalytic cycling. This is attributed to the influence of F-doping on NC which generates asymmetrical charge distributions and larger polarizations by triggering the neighbor carbon atoms. 4 Conclusion In summary, we magnificently introduced salt-assisted strategy (phase-transition between liquid and gas) to fabricate a low cost effective metal-free F, N doped carbon with high performance for ORR in acidic/ alkaline media. The phase-transition step provides one-step F-doping with extra defects in N-doped carbons, which have been proved as the front runner to enhance oxygen reduction reaction performance. Fluorine enrichment in the N-carbon matrix is explored with maximum charge polarization which is beneficial for the preferential orientation of O2 and its subsequent reduction. The as-synthesized F, N co-doped carbon performs comparatively better than other non-Pt based electrocatalysts by exhibiting higher half-wave potential (0.87 V/ 0.78 V) under alkaline/ acidic solutions. Thus, this study provides a new cost-effective strategy by co-doping of carbon materials, which opens new catalytic insights for energy applications.

        "dc:description": "Heteroatom-doping introduces various defects in nanocarbons, herein; we reported salt-assisted synthetic strategy by establishing gas-liquid interface during pyrolysis and explored fluorine enrichment effect on mesoporous N-doped nanocarbons. The F, N co-doped carbon (FNC) performs similar to precious electrocatalysts in terms of onset (0.98 V) and half-wave (0.87 V) potentials under alkaline medium and half-wave potential of 0.78 V vs RHE was observed in acidic medium. F-doping also improves the ORR-pathway by yielding less peroxide production of 2% and also showed good stability of 8000 CV cycles than that of Pt/C. This study not only highlights the insights on the correlation of F, N dual doping and their intrinsic activity but also contributes a new strategy for highly efficient metal-free ORR electrocatalyst by in-situ fabrication of N, F co-doped carbon.",
