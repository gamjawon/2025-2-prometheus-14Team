Mohring and Neil J. Coville* Centre for Applied Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Johannesburg, Wits 2050 (South Africa) (Received January 2, 1992; accepted April 15, 1992) Abstract Investigation of the effect of varying a cyclopentadienyl monoalkyl ring substituent, R (R=H, Me, Et, i-Pr, t-Bu, SiMe3 and CMe2Ph), on the catalytic behaviour of (CPR)ZZrC12/ ethylaluminoxane for the ethylene polymerisation reaction was carried out. The activity data obtained can be explained by a quantitative combination of steric (cone angle, 0) and electronic (Hanunett function, H) parameters. When 0 is defined from the metal as apex, the activity is related to B and H by the equation: Activity (x 106 g PE (mol Zr)-'h-')=0.040(0,)-84.44(F) (RZ=0.91). A correlation of the degree of polymer branching, A (determined from the polymer melting point via A=13.1-0.097 (T ,)), with the electronic parameters only was also observed, viz. A = 3.1(o- ,) + 0.29 (R z = 0.90). The activity of the catalytic system increases with increasing size of the R substituents as well as with increasing electrondonating ability of the substituents. Introduction Since the discovery of Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalysts in the 1950s, numerous studies have been performed to improve catalytic activity and ascertain the mechanism of the catalysed reactions [ 1 ]. For instance, investigations of the `homogeneous' Group 4 metallocene/aluminoxane catalysts have led to the development of catalysts with remarkable polymerisation activity and which are amenable to characterisation [ 2 ]. Modification of the above catalysts, (CPR)ZMXZ (CpR = 77' - C5H4R; M = Ti, Zr, Hf; X = halide, alkyl group), by variation of the ligands surrounding the active centre is possible and permits a correlation of the catalyst structure with catalytic activity and specificity [3]. Surprisingly, little research has been carried out in which the influence of the cyclopentadienyl ring substituents on the formation, stability and behaviour of the catalyst centres was systematically investigated. Activities *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers BY. All rights reserved 42 have been rationalised in terms of steric, electronic and chiral effects of the ligands attached to the active metal centre [ 4 ], although separation of electronic and steric ligand effects was not attempted [5]. Studies have shown that electron-donating substituents increase catalytic activity through enhancement of coordinated anionic propagation and that bulky substituents stabilise the catalyst and reduce decomposition but also hinder monomer approach [4b]. However, no efforts have been made to quantify these effects. Recently we assessed the steric size of monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl rings [6]. These measurements were required in order to evaluate the influence of ring substituents (electronic /steric effects) on NMR parameters associated with the cyclopentadienyl protons and carbon atoms of a series of cyclopentadienyl-iron complexes. It appeared to us that our approach could be applied to the analysis of the catalytic activity associated with the (CpR)ZMC12 / aluminoxane polymerisation catalysts. In this paper, we describe the results of an investigation of the effect of varying a cyclopentadienyl monoalkyl ring substituent, R (R=H, Me, Et, i-Pr, t-Bu, SiMe, and CMe2Ph), on the catalytic behaviour of (CpR)ZZrC12/ ethylaluminoxane for the ethylene polymerisation reaction. The R groups were chosen to span a range of steric [6] and electronic [7] values. The objective of the study was to establish whether the catalyst activity could be associated quantitatively with ligand steric and electronic parameters. To our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the influence of a ligand effect on the ethylene polymerisation reaction of these types of catalyst systems. Experimental General procedures All manipulations were carried out under argon using deoxygenated, dry, distilled solvents. Ethylene (Messer Griesheim, 99.7%) was purified by passage through a molecular sieve column. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC200 NMR spectrometer, and melting points of the polymers were determined using a Du Pont 910 DSC differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Catalyst preparation ZrC14 and Cp2ZrC12 were obtained from Aldrich and used without further purification. The (CpR)ZZrCl2 compounds were prepared according to literature procedures (R = Me [ 8 ], R = Et, t-Bu, SiMe3 [ 9 ], R = i-Pr, CMe2Ph [101) and were characterised by 1H and \"C NMR spectroscopy. Co-catalyst preparation AlEt3 (1.9 M solution in toluene) was obtained from Aldrich and used without further purification. Ethylaluminoxane (EAO) was prepared according to the procedure outlined by Kaminsky et al. [ 11 ]. Finely ground CUS04 - 5H20 43 (0.623 g, 2.49 mmol) was suspended in toluene (15 ml) and the solution cooled to -10 to - 20 C. AlEt3 (10.5 ml, 19.95 mmol) was added dropwise over 15 min. The solution was stirred at this temperature for 3 h, then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a total of 24 h. Ethylene polymerisation reactions All polymerisations were carried out in a 250 ml stainless-steel Berghof autoclave, which was heated to 80 C under vacuum for at least 1 h before polymerisation reactions. Toluene (50 ml) and the co-catalyst solution were transferred to the autoclave under argon and the solution was allowed to warm to the desired temperature over 30 min. Argon was then pumped off and replaced with ethylene. The catalyst was then injected as a solution in toluene and the autoclave pressurised to the desired ethylene pressure. Typical reaction conditions were: [Zr]=6.25X 10-6 M, [Al ]/[Zr]=42 500, P(C2H4) -10 bar, T= 70 C and polymerisation time = 45 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of MeOH. A MeOH-HCl solution was then added to the reaction mixture and the suspension was stirred for several hours. After filtration and washing with MeOH, the polymer was dried in vacuo. The melting points of the polymers (T ,) were determined by DSC at heating rates of 10 C min-' to 100 C and then 5 C min-' to 150 C. The polymers were first melted and cooled in the DSC before the actual melting points were measured. The number of side branches and end groups per 100 C atoms (A) was then calculated from the melting point [ 12 ] according to the equation: A=13.1-0.097 (Ti ) Results and discussion Polymerisation activities The ethylene polymerisation activities for the (CpR)2ZrC1z complexes investigated are listed in Table 1. The R group is expected to influence the activity by means of steric and electronic effects. Steric parameters The steric parameter associated with the R group and hence the C5H4R ligand can be measured by means of a cone angle. Two means of measuring this cone angle are possible: (1) The metal as apex (OI): This cone angle concept was initially used to assess the steric size of Group 15 donor ligands (phosphines, phosphites, etc.) [ 13 ] but has recently been used to assess the size of amines [ 14 ] and CpR rings [6]. The general procedure is to calculate the size of a cone that will incorporate the ligand with the metal as the apex. A metal-cyclopentadienyl ring centroid distance of 2.2 A was chosen to generate the cone, a value consistent with crystal structure data for these complexes [ 9, 15 ] (Fig. 1(a)). 44 TABLE 1 Activities, melting points and A (degree of branching) values for the (CpR)ZZrCIz catalysts R Activity X 105 T.

The limitations to this approach are well documented [ 6, 13 ] . (2) The cyclopentadienyl centroid as apex (02): In this method the ring centroid is chosen as apex for a cone that incorporates the ligand groups (Fig. 1(b)). Data for OZ are also given in Table 2. Electronic parameters Recently the use of Hammett functions to study structure-activity relationships was reviewed [ 7 ]. We have used parameters from this review to assess the possible influence of electronic parameters on the catalytic activity of our catalysts. Multiple regrdssion analysis of the catalyst activities with respect to O and a range of Hammett substituent constants (H) was performed, i.e., the data were fitted to the equation Activity (x 105 g PE (mol Zr)-' h-') = a(8) + b(H) + c (1) (where a, b and c are constants), which describes the plane that best fits 45 TABLE 2 Cone angles (B, and 02) and Hammett parameters (am and F) for the (CpR)ZZrCIz catalysts R B,a O2a 0'mb Fb in (CPR)ZZrC12 H 116 56 0.0 0.03 Me 128 64 -0.07 0.01 Et 132 85 -0.07 0.0 i-Pr 135 107 -0.04 0.04 t-Bu 139 128 - 0.10 - 0.02 SiMe3 144 138 -0.04 0.01 CMe2Ph 145 144 - 0.05 'Ref.

This type of function has been used previously to separate steric and electronic effects [ 16 ]. The best correlations obtained are listed in Table 3, which also shows the best results for the simple regression analysis of activity data. with 0 and H values separately. On moving from a simple to a multiple regression model, RZ values increase and mean square errors decrease, which shows that the activity data are best explained by a combination of steric and electronic effects. The correlation with 01 and F is to be preferred for several reasons. The statistical analysis for this correlation is marginally better than that for the correlation with 02 and o- , and also incorporates all the data points (no o, , value for CMeZPh is available). The Hammett substituent constant, F, is a linear combination of the well-known substituent constants am and up [ 7 ], and its use in this context is more appropriate than the use of o, ,. In addition, the polymerisation reaction takes place at the metal centre, so the use of Ol as the steric parameter seems intuitively more appropriate. The fit to the experimental points, given by the equation Activity = 0.040(Ol) - 84.44(F) 46 is shown in Fig. 2. The plane slopes in both the O- and H-directions, indicating that both steric and electronic effects are important in explaining the activity of these catalysts. Since Rz=0.91, this means that 91% of the variance of the results is explained by the regression of the activities with B and F. Hence the, activity of a particular catalyst in this series can be expressed as a linear combination of an electronic and a steric parameter. The data indicate that an increase in ligand steric size produces a small increase in polymerisation activity, while an increase in ligand electrondonating ability substantially increases the catalytic activity. The product of 84.44 with the range of F values (0.07) is 5.9, while the product of 0.040 with the range of 01 values (29) is only 1.2. The electronic effect can thus be estimated as contributing approximately 80% of the activity change. Enhancement of activity by electron-donating substituents, irrespective of their size, it to be expected. It has been shown that the active species in soluble Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems are cationic, d metal alkyl species [17], and so electron-donating substituents are suggested to decrease the positive charge on the metal centre, weaken the bond between the metal and all its ligands, and hence destabilise the metal-alkyl bond, this increasing catalytic activity [ 18 ] . The influence of the steric effect is not obvious. Howie et al. [15a] have shown that monoalkyl cyclopentadienyl substituents should have no effect on the catalytic activity of alkyne hydroalkylation reactions. Their results were rationalised as follows. The approach of an alkylating group or monomer along the axis bisecting the MC12 bond is not necessarily hindered, since in k N y o yW C a. 0.0700 0.0033 '2oC1 Ilty - _ _ _ _ _ 0.0267 0.0500 116.0 Wig. 2. Activity data plotted versus B, and F. The surface represents the least-squares fit to the data given by the equation Act=O.040(O,)-84.44(F). 47 the case of bulky substituents (e.g., t-Bu), structural analysis shows that the substituents are directed away from the approach of the monomer. Internal rotation of the cyclopentadienyl rings around the metal-cyclopentadienyl ring centroid axis is thus effectively prevented. In the case of smaller substituents, these are able to move away to sterically less demanding positions as the monomer approaches. However, free rotation of the cyclopentadienyl group containing bulky substituents has been demonstrated by Erker and co-workers [ 19 ], and hence steric effects are expected to, and indeed do, play a role in determining catalytic activity. These results should be contrasted with those obtained by Piccolravazzi et al. [4c], who investigated the ethylene polymerization activities of a series of bis(indenyl)zirconium(IV)/methylaluminoxane catalysts. The Zr complexes were substituted on the Cs ring to avoid steric hindrance at the metal centre so that the electronic effects of the indenyl ligands could be investigated separately. Electron-withdrawing substituents were found to decrease polymerisation activity and molecular weight, whereas electron-donating substituents had no appreciable influence on activity or molecular weight. These electronic effects were not quantified. Although there are only 4 data points, our statistical analysis of this data. shows that there is a good correlation between activity and certain Hammett substituent constants (e.g., for o,,R. [ 7 ], R 2 = 0.98). Regression of these activities on both steric and electronic parameters can be expected to improve the correlations, since there are so few data points, but the correlations actually become nonsignificant when a steric parameter (82) is included in the regression. This suggests, as was proposed by the authors, that only electronic factors are in operation in this series of catalysts. The trend found for our catalytic activities differs from the trends observed by other workers also using the (CpR)ZZrC12 catalysts but with methylaluminoxane co-catalyst. Ewen and Chien [4a, b, d] have reported the effects of alkyl substitution on the cyclopentadienyl ring for several compounds, and the order of activity was found to be (CpMe)2ZrC12 > (CpEt)2ZrC12 > (CpNM)ZZrC12 (NM = neomenthyl) > Cp2ZrC12 > (CpMe,)CpZrC12 > (CpMe5)2ZrC12. The results were interpreted to mean that single alkyl substituents increase the activity by electron-donation enhancement of coordinated anionic propagation, whereas very bulky substituents decrease the activity. If the catalyst decays by reductive disproportionation, then low electron density and bulky substituents should stabilise the catalyst. Nekhaeva et al. [4e] report an ethylene polymerisation activity order of (CpSiMe3) ZZrC12 > Cp2ZrCI2 > (CpBu`)ZZrC12 and suggest that the effect can be explained on purely electronic grounds, since the two substituents are sterically similar. We suggest that a possible reason for the difference between our results and earlier results lies in the use of the different co-catalysts. One of the proposed functions of methylaluminoxane is to provide steric bulk to prevent the Zr catalyst centres from deactivating by bimolecular reduction [4a,b,d], which necessitates the use of high Al/Zr ratios [20]. This may mean that 48 A 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 ~_ -0.1 o -0.1 -0.05 0 0.05 Qm Fig. 3. Values of A plotted against o-m. The line represents the least-squares fit to the data given by the equation A=3.1(am)+0.29. steric effects due to the substituents are not seen until the substituents become very large (e.g., CpMeS), i.e, the reactivity patterns proceed according to electronic effects alone for monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl complexes. Ethylaluminoxane, however, is not as efficient a co-catalyst, possibly owing to a lower degree of oligomerisation [2b, 11, 15, 21 ], and hence steric effects of the monoalkyl substituents in terms of catalyst stability become more important. This would explain the trends in activity observed with the ethylaluminoxane co-catalysed systems. Melting point data Only a small variation in the melting points (and hence in A, the degree of branching) of the polymers produced by the (CpR)zZrC12 catalysts was noted. The A values extend from 0.0 to 0.4 chain ends or branches per 100 C atoms, which represents a low degree of branching. There is a good correlation between A and the electronic parameter, om (A = 3.1(Q t) + 0.29, RZ = 0.90, F= 57.28, p = 0.0006, m.s.e. = 0.0025) (Mg. 3), which suggests that chain branching is affected only by electronic parameters, and that a contribution from steric factors is statistically not important here. Conclusion Both steric and electronic effects associated with the cyclopentadienyl ligand in (CpR)2ZrC12 complexes are expected to influence the catalytic activity of the zirconium in ethylene polymerisation studies. Our work has shown that these influences can be quantified and that, for the catalysts under consideration, the electronic effect dominates in determining catalyst 49 behaviour. It can be predicted based on this study that as the R group becomes bulkier or multiple substitution of the ring takes place, the steric effects should be more dominant. However, numerous qualitative statements have appeared in the literature which suggest that if the cyclopentadienyl ligands become too bulky, catalytic activity decreases. In principle it should thus be possible to quantify the optimum size of R needed to maximise catalytic activity, and work pursuing this objective is under way in our laboratory.

X244 9280183H 0304-5102(92)80183-H 10.1016/0304-5102(92)80183-H Quantification of the influence of steric and electronic parameters on the ethylene polymerisation activity of (CpR)2ZrCl2/ethylaluminoxane Ziegler—Natta catalysts Petra C. Möhring Neil J. Coville ∗ Centre for Applied Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Johannesburg, Wits 2050 South Africa * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Investigation of the effect of varying a cyclopentadienyl monoalkyl ring substituent, R (R  H, Me, Et, i-Pr, t-Bu, SiMe3 and CMe2Ph), on the catalytic behaviour of (CpR)2ZrCl2/ ethylaluminoxane for the ethylene polymerisation reaction was carried out. The activity data obtained can be explained by a quantitative combination of steric (cone angle, θ) and electronic (Hammett function, H) parameters. When θ is defined from the metal as apex, the activity is related to θ and H by the equation: Activity (× 105 g PE (mol Zr)−1h−1) = 0.040(θ1) −84.44(F) (R 2 = 0.91). A correlation of the degree of polymer branching, (determined from the polymer melting point via A = 13.1 − 0.097 (T m)), with the electronic parameters only was also observed, viz. A = 3.1(σm + 0.29 (R 2 = 0.90). The activity of the catalytic system increases with increasing size of the R substituents as well as with increasing electron-donating ability of the substituents.
