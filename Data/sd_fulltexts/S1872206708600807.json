Influence of the Reducing Atmosphere on the Structure and Activity of Mo-V-Te-Nb-O Catalysts for Propane Selective Oxidation DENG Zhonghua 1,2 , WANG Hongxin 1,2 , CHU Wenling 1, *, YANG Weishen 1,# 1 State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China Abstract: The effects of the addition of the reductant (ammonium chloride) on Mo-V-Te-Nb-O mixed oxide catalysts for propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid were systematically investigated. The presence of the reductant during catalyst preparation had a significant impact on the mobility of lattice oxygen mainly responsible for the catalytic activity of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts. Furthermore, the addition of the reductant resulted in clear changes in catalyst morphology and phase composition, which are important factors in the formation of acrylic acid. A high content of the orthorhombic M1 phase led to a high selectivity to acrylic acid at low temperatures (< 653 K), while a high content of the hexagonal M2 phase promoted the formation of acrylic acid at high temperatures (> 653 K). Key words: Mo-V-Te-Nb oxide catalyst; propane; selective oxidation; acrylic acid; reductant Due to their abundance and low cost, light alkanes are widely used as starting materials for the industrial production of many oxygenates. Mixed metal oxides are important inor- ganic materials [1] and have been widely employed in the selective oxidation of alkanes due to the mobility of their lattice oxygen, which can be both involved in the extraction of hy- drogen from hydrocarbons and oxidation of the adsorbed molecule [2–4]. In particular, Mo-V-Te-Nb-O mixed metal oxides have received much attention because of their high activity and selectivity in the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid [5–12]. It is well known that two phases, the so-called orthorhombic M1 [13–15] and hexagonal M2 phases [16–18], are indispensable for a highly effective catalyst. Still, however, there is ongoing debate about the origin of the high catalytic performance of Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts. It has been proposed that the introduction of a redox process in the catalyst preparation [19–22] can affect the physico- chemical properties and catalytic activity of the Mo-V-Te- Nb-O catalysts. In the present paper, we selected ammonium chloride as a reductant and systematically investigated the effect of the presence of the reductant on the phase composition, mobility of the lattice oxygen, and catalytic performance. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation A uniform aqueous solution was made with 6.4 g ammonium paramolybdate (Aldrich), 1.3 g ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich), and 1.4 g telluric acid (Aldrich) dissolved in 80 ml of deionized water at 353 K in a flask. A fixed amount of ammo- nium chloride was added as reductant to the Mo-V-Te solution and mixed for 1 h. Then the solution was cooled to 313 K, and 60.7 ml of an aqueous solution of niobium oxalate with a nio- bium concentration of 7.8 mg/ml was added dropwise to obtain an orange slurry. The slurry was mixed for 30 min and then 20 ml of 1.6 mol/L nitric acid was added. After rotation for 1 h, the water of the slurry was removed using a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 313–343 K and a low pressure of 1.3–5.3 kPa. The obtained solid precursor was calcined under nitrogen DENG Zhonghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(10): 1032–1036 flow (1 ml/min) at 873 K for 2 h. Finally the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O sample was crushed and sieved to retain particles of 20–30 mesh diameter. The samples obtained using ammonium chlo- ride to Mo molar ratios 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 were denoted as catalysts A, B, C, and D, respectively. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer employing Cu K . radiation ( = 0.1542 nm) in the 2 range of 5°–60° with a scanning rate of 5°/min and operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Quanta 200F microscope. BET specific surface areas were measured on a Beckman Coulter apparatus using N 2 adsorption at 77 K. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was carried out in the temperature range of 473–1073 K. A 0.05 g sample in a quartz microreactor was purged with flowing He at 423 K for 0.5 h to eliminate water. The sample was reduced using a rate of 10 K/min and a mixture of 5% H 2 /Ar at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The product was analyzed using an online mass spectrometer (OmniStar) and the following m/e ratios were employed for the identification of the various gases: H 2 , m/e = 2; Ar, m/e = 40. X-ray photoelec- tron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG Escalab MK2 Spectrometer using Al K . radiation (1486.6 eV) operating at 12.5 kV and 20 mA. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was performed on a Philips Magix instrument. 1.3 Catalyst activity measurements Propane oxidation was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a conventional flow system with a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor in the temperature range of 613–673 K. The feed composition was C 3 H 8 :air:H 2 O (steam) = 1:15:12 (volume). The amount of catalyst was 2.14 g and the total flow rate was 28 ml/min. The product was collected and analyzed by an online GC system equipped with the following columns: (1) molecular sieve 13X to separate O 2 , N 2 , and CO; (2) Hayesep Q to separate hydrocarbons and CO 2 . The liquid phase was col- lected by a cold trap and separated by off-line GC with an FFAP capillary column to separate oxygenated products (acetic acid and acrylic acid). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of the catalysts The crystalline structure is a key factor affecting the catalytic activity of Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts. Most catalytically active Mo-V-Te-Nb-O samples are predominantly composed of the orthorhombic M1 phase, whereas the hexagonal M2 phase has little activity. Preparation conditions such as the precursor, preparation method, and addition of a reductant/oxidant can influence the final crystalline structure. To investigate the effect of the addition of a reductant, Mo-V-Te-Nb-O samples prepared using the addition of ammonium chloride were characterized by XRD (Fig. 1). Catalyst A without the reduc- tant exhibited the pure M1 phase [23]. With an increase in the content of the reductant, the M2 phase appeared [23], and further increase in the ratio of reductant Cl/Mo above 0.2 led to the formation of monoclinic Mo 8 O 23 species detectable by the characteristic 2 diffraction peaks at 14.4°, 21.9°, 26.8°, 29.4°, 33.5°, and 52.2° (JCPDS 05-339). Using results from the literature [5], the ratios of the peak area for the M1 phase at 7.9° and the M2 phase at 28.3° [24] (Table 1) to the peak area at 22.1° were used to calculate their relative quantities. The results clearly showed that the addition of the reductant resulted in a significant change in the M1 phase and M2 phase, suggesting that the ratio of the M1 and M2 phases can be controlled by the amount of reductant added to get the most appropriate ratio for selective oxidation. We have also investigated the Cl ion content in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst by XRF and XPS, but no Cl ions were found. Therefore, it should be suggested that Cl � anions acted as a reductant to reduce the high valence metal cations. SEM images of the catalysts treated with ammonium chlo- ride are shown in Fig. 2. The microstructure varied distinctly with increased reductant content. The observed morphology Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts with different amounts of added ammonium chloride.

Catalysts A, B, C, and D refer to Mo-V-Te-Nb-O obtained by using ammonium chloride to Mo molar ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. M1 and M2 are reference patterns. DENG Zhonghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(10): 1032–1036 for catalyst A with the pure M1 phase displayed a typically regular rod-shaped structure of 150–200 nm diameter and 400–600 nm length. After reduction with different amounts of ammonium chloride, long rod-shaped materials were not seen in the SEM images (Fig. 2(b)–(d)), clearly indicating that other phases had grown together with the M1 phase. Fig. 3 shows the results of H 2 -TPR experiments for com- paring lattice oxygen mobility, in which the reduction tem- perature indicates directly the mobility of the lattice oxygen. It was found that there was one broad H 2 consumption peak for all the catalysts, which is due to the reduction of Mo 6+ , V 5+ , and Te 4+ species [25]. The lattice oxygen mobility and the tem- perature for the onset of reduction were in the order catalyst A > B > C ~ D. Catalyst A with a pure M1 phase exhibited the Table 1 Effect of the amount of ammonium chloride on the crystal- line structure and BET specific surface area of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts Relative intensities of XRD peaks a Catalyst 7.9° 28.3° 29.5° A BET /(m 2 /g) A 41.4 — — 6.54 B 22.0 15.3 — 7.07 C 23.0 34.0 — 5.28 D 2.6 13.4 6.7 1.24 a With respect to the diffraction line of 2 = 22.1° (the strongest peak for M1, M2, and Mo 8 O 23 to the (001) crystal face).

With the increase in the amount of ammonium chloride, the mobility of lattice oxygen decreased. The results demonstrated that the presence of the reductant had a significant effect on the mobility of lattice oxygen. 2.2 Catalytic performance of the catalysts Fig. 4 illustrates propane conversion and selectivity to acrylic acid of the catalysts. Catalyst A without addition of reductant exhibited the highest conversion of propane at all temperatures investigated. It is worth noting that the order of the catalytic activity was catalyst A > B > C ~ D, which was in good agreement with that of lattice oxygen mobility. Conse- quently, the oxygen mobility of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalyst can be correlated with catalytic activity, namely, higher lattice oxygen mobility gave higher propane conversion. In addition, by considering the crystalline structure of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts, another possible explanation for the different cata- lytic performance of the catalysts is the presence of the M1 phase that is catalytically active. It is well known that the M1 phase is the active and selective phase in the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid, while the M2 phase is a selective phase that can only convert propylene to acrylic acid above 653 K. Accordingly, it is clear that at low reaction temperatures (< 653 K), the presence of the orthorhombic M1 phase is critical and has an important influ- ence on the formation of acrylic acid, as seen by that the highest selectivity to acrylic acid was given by catalyst A with the pure M1 phase. However, at high reaction temperatures (> 653 K), catalyst C with the highest content of the M2 phase exhibited the highest selectivity to acrylic acid. This is in good agreement with previous results, in which the M2 phase was indicated to take part in the selective oxidation by converting propylene to acrylic acid above 653 K. 3 Conclusions Ammonium chloride was used as a reductant to prepare Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. The effect of the addition of the reductant on the catalyst was studied. The presence of the reductant strongly affected the reactivity of lattice oxygen. There was a direct correlation between catalytic activity and the mobility of the lattice oxygen. In addition, the presence of the reductant also played an important role in determining the crystalline struc- ture. In the absence of the reductant, the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O cata- lyst contained only the orthorhombic M1 phase with a regular rod-shaped structure. The addition of the reductant produced mixed phase catalysts with orthorhombic M1 and hexagonal M2 phases, and even the Mo 8 O 23 phase. At low temperatures, the M1 phase content was responsible for the high selectivity to acrylic acid, while at high temperatures the selectivity was determined by the M2 phase content.

        "dc:description": "The effects of the addition of the reductant (ammonium chloride) on Mo-V-Te-Nb-O mixed oxide catalysts for propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid were systematically investigated. The presence of the reductant during catalyst preparation had a significant impact on the mobility of lattice oxygen mainly responsible for the catalytic activity of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-O catalysts. Furthermore, the addition of the reductant resulted in clear changes in catalyst morphology and phase composition, which are important factors in the formation of acrylic acid. A high content of the orthorhombic M1 phase led to a high selectivity to acrylic acid at low temperatures (< 653 K), while a high content of the hexagonal M2 phase promoted the formation of acrylic acid at high temperatures (> 653 K).",
