The development of high-efficiency acidic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts constitutes a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Although ruthenium (Ru)-based oxides are acknowledged as one of the most exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic media, the inherent instability of Ru-based catalysts during OER processes remains a fundamental obstacle to their widespread implementation. Consequently, the pursuit of Ru-based catalysts with superior stability is imperative. Utilizing electrospinning technology, a precursor material with a nanofiber structure was obtained. Precise control of the calcination conditions enabled the material to retain its nanofiber structure while simultaneously regulating the oxidation state of Ru in RuO2, lengthening the Ru-O bond. This effectively mitigated the over-oxidation of Ru. These material optimizations, combined with the significantly enhanced Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM), synergistically accelerated the water dissociation kinetics in acidic media while ensuring robust catalyst stability. Under the optimized calcination conditions (400°C for 2 h), the resulting catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of merely 59.55 mV dec−1, outperforming commercial RuO2.

All chemicals used were of analytical grade, and all solutions used for experiments were prepared with deionized water (resistivity ≥ 18 MΩ cm). 1.2 Synthesis of electrospun RuCl3/PVP precursor material RuCl3/PVP precursor material by a combination of electrospinning and calcination. 5 mL of DMF was mixed with 5 mL of ethanol, and then 100 mg of RuCl3∙H2O was dissolved in the DMF and ethanol mixture and stirred for 10 min. 1.2 g of PVP was added to the metal precursor solution. the metal precursor solution was stabilized by magnetic stirring at room temperature overnight, about 24 h, to obtain a completely homogeneous solution. The precursor solution was placed into a plastic syringe; the precursor solution was ejected at a flow rate of 0.1 mL min−1 using an electrospinning system, and finally 1000 mg of precursor material was obtained. The production speed of electrospinning was approximately 2 mg min−1. The distance between the tip of the electrospun nanofiber collector and the aluminum foil was 12 cm, and a voltage of 18 kV was applied. 1.3 Materials characterization The morphological structure of material was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to analyze their morphology and particle distribution. Phase composition was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å), while surface chemical states were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Al-Kα source, 1486.6 eV). Reaction intermediates were tracked in real-time using an in-situ FTIR system equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector, complemented by in-situ Raman spectroscopy performed on a confocal Raman system with a 532 nm laser excitation and a CCD detector. Both techniques were integrated with a three-electrode electrochemical cell and an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory. All in-situ experiments were performed under a standard three-electrode configuration. 2 Introduction To address the challenges posed by environmental pollution and energy crises to social development, the development of sustainable clean energy is imperative [1–4]. Hydrogen energy, characterized by zero carbon emissions and high energy density, is considered the most promising secondary energy carrier [5–8]. Electrochemical water splitting is widely recognized as a highly feasible technology with current technical capabilities for producing green hydrogen, with proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology drawing significant attention due to its fast response time and high energy conversion efficiency [9–12]. The core bottleneck of this technology lies in the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a coupled four-electron-proton transfer process requiring higher overpotential to overcome kinetic barriers. In this regard, reducing the kinetic barriers of OER is crucial for improving the overall efficiency of water electrolysis [12–16]. ruthenium (Ru)-based oxides and iridium (Ir)-based oxides are recognized as two state-of-the-art OER catalysts in acidic environments. While RuO2 exhibits superior OER catalytic activity, its stability is inferior to that of IrO2. Consequently, IrO2 has been adopted in practical PEM electrolyzers. However, the scarcity of IrO2 greatly limits its large-scale application. In contrast, Ru, a relatively abundant platinum group metal, is only 20% of the price of platinum, and the unique electronic structure of its 3d orbital provides excellent intermediate adsorption energy regulation. However, Ru-based catalysts often have serious stability problems, especially under harsh water electrolysis conditions. Therefore, the development of Ru-based catalysts with high stability is the focus of current research [17–21]. To overcome the aforementioned limitation, He et al. proposed a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy. They synthesized ultrathin RuO2 nanosheets rich in grain boundaries (GB-RuO2) using a salt-assisted recrystallization method. These grain boundaries simultaneously introduce tensile strain and generate unsaturated coordination sites, which not only optimize the adsorption of reaction intermediates but also suppress the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway. Consequently, grain boundary engineering represents an effective strategy for enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance [22]. In the field of catalyst support design, one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials demonstrate remarkable advantages due to their unique structural features. The elongated configuration not only facilitates rapid electron transfer but also optimizes mass transport pathways [23–25]. As a pivotal fabrication technique, electrospinning has evolved into an effective strategy for precisely regulating the dimensions, morphologies, and crystalline characteristics of nanostructures. This method enables the controlled synthesis of continuous nanofibers with stacked architectures, including nanowires, nanotubes, and their composite configurations [26,27]. Currently, this technology has found extensive applications in energy conversion and storage fields, particularly in designing functionalized water-splitting electrocatalysts and developing rechargeable metal batteries [28–30]. Given the widespread adoption of electrospinning in catalyst preparation, this study focuses on a critical step in its fabrication process - the optimization of calcination parameters. Through systematic investigation of calcination temperature and duration, we aim to elucidate their profound impacts on the final catalyst's microstructure, surface properties, and catalytic performance mechanisms. In this study, nanofibers with RuO2/Ru heterointerface were prepared via electrospinning process and different heat treatment methods. The calcination temperature and time were continuously optimized, resulting in nanofiber materials with excellent structure and OER performance. It is worth emphasizing that different calcination temperatures and times have a significant impact on the morphology of the materials. Only with appropriate calcination temperature and time can the complete preservation of the one-dimensional nanostructure be ensured, the length of Ru-O bonds be extended, and the optimal electronic structure be obtained. These synergistic optimizations significantly enhance the AEM mechanism, while ensuring structural stability and catalytic activity, thus enabling the materials to exhibit the highest operational performance. 3 Results and discussion The method for preparing RuO2/Ru NFs is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. Initially, RuCl3/PVP precursor material was fabricated via a simple electrospinning technique, followed by a calcination process to obtain RuO2/Ru NFs. To investigate the effects of calcination conditions on the material and determine the optimal parameters, we initially calcined the material at 400°C for 2 h (RuO2/Ru-400-2). This preliminary experiment aimed to verify whether the calcined product could retain its 1D nanostructure while preserving the dual presence of RuO2 and Ru, to further explore how calcination conditions control the structural integrity, phase composition, electronic structure, etc. of materials. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1b1 and Fig. 1b2 reveal the morphology of RuCl3/PVP precursor material and RuO2/Ru-400-2. After calcination, RuO2/Ru-400-2 retained the 1D nanostructure of the RuCl3/PVP precursor material but underwent structural changes. Compared with the prepared RuCl3/PVP precursor material, the fibers in RuO2/ Ru-400-2 exhibit greater curvature, which means that the material has a larger specific surface area. Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d display high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images with insets showing Fast Fourier transform (FFT) images of RuO2/Ru-400-2. The lattice spacing of RuO2 in RuO2/Ru-400-2 is approximately 0.325 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane, while the lattice spacing of Ru measures about 0.215 nm, matching the (002) plane. These observations confirm the coexistence of both RuO2 and Ru phases in RuO2/Ru-400-2. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S1, the HRTEM image of RuO2/Ru-400-2 clearly reveals the lattice fringes of both phases: an interplanar spacing of 0.323 nm corresponds to the (101) plane of RuO2, while a spacing of 0.205 nm matches the (101) plane of metallic Ru. The distinct boundary between these two phases confirms the existence of the Ru/RuO2 heterointerface. Based on the above results, RuO2/Ru-400-2 retained its 1D nanostructure and showed coexistence of RuO2 and Ru phases. Therefore, to study the effect of calcination temperature on the material, while keeping the calcination duration at 2 h, the calcination temperature was adjusted to 350°C (RuO2/Ru-350-2) and 450°C (RuO2/Ru-450-2). By observing the changes in the material with temperature, to explore the optimal calcination temperature. Fig. 2a-c demonstrate the morphological evolution of the material under different calcination temperatures. Both RuO2/Ru-350-2 and RuO2/Ru-400-2 retained the 1D nanostructure inherited from RuCl3/PVP precursor material, whereas no such structure was observed in RuO2/Ru-450-2. This indicates that temperature variation significantly affects the surface morphology of the catalyst, with excessively high temperatures leading to the disappearance of the 1D nanostructure. Fig. 2d presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts calcined at different temperatures. Diffraction peaks corresponding to both Ru and RuO2 phases are observed across all calcination conditions. With the increase of temperature, compared with RuO2/Ru-350-2, the diffraction intensity of the (101) surface of metallic Ru in RuO2/ Ru-450-2 and RuO2 Ru-400-2 shows a significant decrease relative to the (110) and (101) surfaces of RuO2, indicating a reduction in Ru content accompanied by a simultaneous increase in RuO2 content [31]. In order to further explore the influence of calcination temperature changes on the electronic structure of catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy were employed. Due to the overlap of the Ru 3d peak with the C 1s peak, the Ru 3p region was analyzed. These catalysts exhibit dual valence states of Ru: +4 (RuO2) and 0 (metallic Ru). The Ru4+ 3p1/2 binding energies of RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-400-2, and RuO2/Ru-450-2 are observed at 486.30 eV, 485.42 eV, and 485.82 eV, respectively [32,33]. Notably, the Ru 3p1/2 peak of RuO2/Ru-400-2 demonstrates negative shifts of 0.88 eV and 0.40 eV compared to RuO2/Ru-350-2 and RuO2/Ru-450-2, respectively. A parallel trend is observed in the Ru4+ 3p3/2 peak, where RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibits negative shifts of 0.79 eV and 0.16 eV relative to RuO2/Ru-350-2 and RuO2/Ru-450-2, respectively. These shifts indicate a lower average oxidation state of Ru4+ in RuO2/Ru-400-2. This phenomenon might be caused by the synergistic interaction between metals Ru and RuO2 in the catalysts, which is consistent with previous reports [34]. It is noteworthy that the ratio of Ru4+ to Ru0 varies with temperature. In RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-400-2, and RuO2/Ru-450-2, the Ru4+ to Ru0 ratios are 28.41%: 71.59%, 37.14%: 62.86% and 38.02%: 61.98%, respectively. With the increase of temperature, the content of Ru4+ gradually increases and the content of Ru0 gradually decreases. This observation aligns with the trend of RuO2 and Ru phase diffraction intensities derived from XRD analysis (Fig. 2e). These results indicate that increasing temperature enhances the conversion of metallic Ru to RuO2 until a dynamic equilibrium is reached, after which the phase composition changes minimally. These temperature-dependent variations highlight the tunability of the electronic structure in Ru/RuO2 NFs under calcination conditions. In addition to the change in electronic structure, metal Ru also affects the Ru-O bond length in RuO2. This change can be explored through Raman spectroscopy. In Raman spectroscopy, the vibrational frequency is inversely related to the bond length for a given mode; a higher frequency (blue shift) indicates a shorter bond, while a lower frequency (red shift) indicates a longer bond. Thus, a redshift usually indicates that the Ru-O bond is longer, while a blue shift indicates that the Ru-O bond is shorter. As shown in Fig. 2f, RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-400-2 and RuO2/Ru-450-2 exhibit two Raman features, named Eg and A1g modes. It is worth noting that RuO2/Ru-350-2 and RuO2/Ru-450-2 compared RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibit a blue shift of 9 cm and 7 cm in Eg vibration mode, which corresponds to the bending vibration of the O-Ru-O bond [34]. By optimizing the calcination temperature, a well-balanced structure with appropriate relative ratios of RuO2 to Ru can be achieved, thereby effectively increasing the Ru-O bond length in RuO2. According to previous studies, the strong Ru-O covalent interaction is a primary factor contributing to the poor stability of RuO2. Thus, elongating the Ru-O bond length can enhance the OER stability of RuO2 [35,36]. The influence of calcination conditions on the catalyst was further studied. Based on various advantages of RuO2/Ru-400-2, the temperature was fixed at 400°C. The calcination duration was changed to 1 h (RuO2/Ru-400-1) and 3 h (RuO2/Ru-400-3) to explore the influence of calcination time, another important factor, on the catalyst. The results show that the influence of the change in calcination time on the catalyst is similar to that of the change in calcination temperature on the catalyst. RuO2/Ru-400-1 retains the 1D nanostructure, but RuO2/Ru-400-3 loses this required form (Fig. S2). The XRD patterns of RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3. Both catalysts exhibit diffraction peaks corresponding to the Ru and RuO2 phases, showing trends analogous to those observed under different calcination temperatures. Specifically, the diffraction intensity of the (101) plane of metallic Ru in RuO2/Ru-400-2 and RuO2/Ru-400-3 is significantly reduced relative to the (110) and (101) planes of RuO2 when compared to RuO2/Ru-400-1, suggesting that prolonged calcination leads to decreased Ru content and increased RuO2 formation (Fig. S3). In order to further explore the effect of calcination time on the electronic structure of the catalyst, XPS and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3. The Ru 3p region shows that the Ru4+ 3p1/2 peak positions of RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3 are 486.46 eV and 485.88 eV respectively, with positive displacements of 1.04 eV and 0.46 eV respectively compared to RuO2/Ru-400-2, the Ru4+ 3p3/2 also has positive displacements of 0.59 eV and 0.30 eV, respectively. The content changes of Ru4+ and Ru0 are similar to the trends when the calcination temperature changes. The content of Ru4+ in RuO2/Ru-400-1 is 28.93%, while the content of Ru4+ in RuO2/Ru-400-3 is 36.63%, which shows no significant difference from RuO2/Ru-400-2 (Fig. S4). In Fig. S5, the Raman spectra of RuO2/Ru-400-1, RuO2/Ru-400-2 and RuO2/Ru-400-2 are shown. In the Eg vibration mode, compare with the 15 cm and 5 cm blue shifts of RuO2/Ru-400-2, RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3 respectively, this means that the Ru-O bond of RuO2/Ru-400-2 is longer. In summary, among catalysts treated under a series of different calcination conditions, RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibits a favorable nanostructure, enhanced electronic structure, and prolonged Ru-O bond length. These characteristics imply that RuO2/Ru-400-2 can achieve superior OER performance, demonstrating that the properties of the material are significantly influenced by the calcination conditions. The OER performance of the catalysts calcined at different temperatures (RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-400-2, RuO2/Ru-450-2) and commercial RuO2 (C-RuO2) was preliminarily compared through a three-electrode system in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. To preliminarily verify whether the good morphology and electronic structure of RuO2/Ru-400-2 are transformed into enhanced OER activity. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) profiles, illustrated in Fig. 3 a, RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibits an overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2(η10), significantly outperforming C-RuO2 (η10 = 345 mV), RuO2/Ru-350-2 (η10 = 252 mV), and RuO2/Ru-450-2 (η10 = 268 mV). Furthermore, RuO2/Ru-400-2 displays the smallest Tafel slope of 59.55 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3b), compared to RuO2/Ru-350-2 (60.33 mV dec−1), RuO2/Ru-450-2 (64.49 mV dec−1), and C-RuO2 (68.78 mV dec−1), indicating significantly faster electrocatalytic kinetics. To further quantify the electrocatalytic efficiency of RuO2/Ru NFs under OER conditions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to probe electrode kinetics. The Nyquist plots reveal that RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibits faster charge transfer than RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-450-2, and C-RuO2. These demonstrates that tailoring the calcination temperature to modulate catalyst morphology and fine-tune the electronic structure of Ru effectively enhances OER performance (Fig. 3c). In order to quantify the active sites and evaluate the inherent activities, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was derived by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scanning rates. (Fig. S6). The Cdl values for RuO2/Ru-350-2, RuO2/Ru-400-2, RuO2/Ru-450-2, and C-RuO2 are 45.09 mF cm−2, 61.28 mF cm−2, 21.55 mF cm−2, and 9.25 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3d), The Cdl value of RuO2/Ru-400-2 is much greater than that of RuO2/Ru-350-2 and RuO2/Ru-450-2. Meanwhile, the Electrochemical surface area (ECSA)-normalized OER performance showed that RuO2/Ru-400-2 had higher intrinsic activity compared with other control catalysts (Fig. S7). These results are consistent with the SEM images observed previously. RuO2/Ru-400-2 retains the 1D nanostructure, which enables RuO2/Ru-400-2 to have a larger specific surface area and more catalytic active sites. Durability, a critical metric for evaluating OER performance in corrosive acidic environments, was assessed via chronoamperometry (CP) at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3e). RuO2/Ru-400-2 demonstrates exceptional stability, with only a 50 mV increase in overpotential after 100 h of continuous operation. In contrast, under the same conditions, C-RuO2 showed a rapid increase in overpotential after only 20 h. Moreover, at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, RuO2/Ru-400-2 can operate for 50 h (Fig. S8). This superior stability is attributed to the lower average oxidation state of Ru and the elongated Ru-O bonds in RuO2/Ru-400-2, which mitigate structural degradation by weakening the Ru-O covalent interaction, thereby enhancing RuO2 stability. To further evaluate its stability, XRD, HRTEM, and XPS were used to analyze the crystal structure and electronic structure of RuO2/Ru-400-2 before and after the stability test. XRD patterns show that after the stability test, diffraction peaks corresponding to Ru and RuO2 phases are still observable in the material. Additionally, HRTEM images still reveal a lattice spacing of approximately 0.324 nm for RuO2, corresponding to the (101) plane, while the lattice spacing of Ru is about 0.205 nm, matching the (101) plane. In the XPS spectra, after thestability test, a small amount of high-valent Ruⁿ⁺ is generated; however, the binding energy of Ru4+ only increases slightly. This indicates that only a small portion of RuO2 is oxidized to high-valent ruthenium (Fig. S9). These results confirm that RuO2/Ru-400-2 can maintain structural stability during the OER process. To further verify the optimized performance of RuO2/Ru-400-2, we compared the OER performance of catalysts with different calcination times (RuO2/Ru-400-1, RuO2/Ru-400-2, RuO2/Ru-400-3). As shown in Fig. S10, RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3 exhibit higher η10 values of 252 mV and 268 mV, respectively, compared to RuO2/Ru-400-2 (245 mV). The Tafel slopes (61.84 mV dec−1 for RuO2/Ru-400-1 and 62.01 mV dec−1 for RuO2/Ru-400-3) are also larger than that of RuO2/Ru-400-2 (59.55 mV dec−1), It is indicated that RuO2/Ru-400-2 has a faster catalytic kinetics under different calcination times (Fig. S11). EIS analysis confirms slower charge transfer in RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3(Fig. S12). Furthermore, RuO2/Ru-400-1 and RuO2/Ru-400-3 exhibit ECSA values of 24.27 mF cm−2 and 22.41 mF cm−2, respectively, significantly lower than that of RuO2/Ru-400-2 (Fig. S13) and the ECSA-normalized OER performance analysis showed that RuO2/Ru-400-2 also had better catalytic activity in the comparison of catalysts with different calcination times (Fig. S14). This observation further verifies that RuO2/Ru-400-2 achieves enhanced OER activity through optimized morphological and electronic structural transformations under varying calcination conditions [37,38]. These results collectively underscore that RuO2/Ru-400-2, synthesized at 400°C for 2 h, achieves an optimal balance of morphology, electronic structure, and Ru-O bond length, leading to exceptional OER activity, faster catalytic kinetics and excellent stability. The in-situ ATR-SEIRAS technique was adopted to identify the reaction intermediates, and the mechanism of action of OER on RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2 was studied. Fig. 4 a displays the in situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra of RuO2/Ru-400-2 under different applied potentials. At lower potentials, a prominent absorption peak at 1070 cm−1 was observed, corresponding to the *O-O stretching vibration of *OOH intermediates adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Concurrently, an absorption feature at 3371 cm−1 emerged, attributable to the O-H stretching vibration of *OH species. Recent studies have suggested that the presence of *OOH indicates that the OER process may involve the AEM [39,40]. In contrast, C-RuO2 shows a relatively weak *OOH signal intensity. Only when the applied potential exceeds 1.4 V will a distinct *OOH related absorption band appear at 1071 cm−1 (Fig. 4b). These observations demonstrate the predominant role of AEM in governing the oxygen evolution pathway for both RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2. Notably, compared to C-RuO2, RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibited more pronounced enhancement in absorption peak intensity with increasing potential, indicating its enhanced AEM pathway activation and improved catalytic activity. The AEM mechanism behaves as an electron-proton coupling process, which means that the catalytic activity of catalysts dominated by the AEM mechanism is pH-independent [15]. LSV curves of RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2 under different pH conditions show that both exhibit pH-independent activity (Fig. S15), which further confirms that both RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2 are predominantly governed by the AEM mechanism. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) follows a well-recognized mechanism, where methanol molecules tend to nucleophilically attack the electrophilic *OH. Therefore, MOR is more active on surfaces with stronger *OH adsorption [36]. After adding 1.0 M methanol to the 0.1 M HClO4 solution, the current densities of RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2 increased significantly compared to those before methanol addition, which was attributed to the electrooxidation of methanol. By calculating the filled area between the curves, the current density difference caused by MOR can be quantified, which is proportional to the number of transferred charges. The current difference between MOR and OER on RuO2/Ru-400-2 is larger than that on C-RuO2, indicating a stronger MOR competitive reaction and verifyinga the enhanced adsorption of *OH on RuO2/Ru-400-2 (Fig. S16). To further investigate the changes in the catalyst during the reaction process, in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to monitor variations in surface intermediates and the valence states of metal sites. Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d respectively present the Raman spectra of RuO2/Ru-400-2 and C-RuO2 recorded at 100 mV intervals within the potential range of open-circuit potential (OCP) to 1.5 V. The Raman bands observed at 518 and 634 cm−1 in RuO2/Ru-400-2 are attributed to the Eg and A1g modes of rutile-type RuO2. When the potential increased from OCP to 1.5 V, a weakened signal was observed in C-RuO2, while the Raman intensity of RuO2/Ru-400-2 remained relatively stable. The decrease in the Raman signal intensity usually indicates structural damage or amorphous transformation. This means that RuO2/Ru-400-2 can maintain structural stability at a high oxidation potential [38–41]. This is consistent with the result that the performance of RuO2/Ru-400-2 in the durability test far exceeds that of C-RuO2. 4 Conclusions To sum up, by employing the electrospinning technology and precisely controlling the heat treatment conditions, we have successfully prepared RuO2/Ru NFs with 1D nanostructures and excellent OER performance. It is particularly noteworthy that the differences in calcination conditions can exert a tremendous impact on the catalyst properties. In this research, RuO2/Ru-400-2 exhibited even more outstanding OER performance compared to catalysts treated under other conditions and C-RuO2. On the one hand, this is attributed to its superior microstructure, optimized electronic structure and extended Ru-O bond lengths; on the other hand, compared with C-RuO2, RuO2/Ru-400-2 significantly enhances the AEM mechanism, enabling the catalyst to achieve high activity and significantly enhanced stability. This work provides extremely valuable reference for subsequent catalyst preparation using electrospinning technology. It is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of the influence of different heat treatment conditions on catalysts. During the preparation process, precise control of conditions is required to ensure the integrity of the catalyst structure and, thus, to optimize the catalyst performance.

        "dc:description": "The development of high-efficiency acidic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts constitutes a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Although ruthenium (Ru)-based oxides are acknowledged as one of the most exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic media, the inherent instability of Ru-based catalysts during OER processes remains a fundamental obstacle to their widespread implementation. Consequently, the pursuit of Ru-based catalysts with superior stability is imperative. Utilizing electrospinning technology, a precursor material with a nanofiber structure was obtained. Precise control of the calcination conditions enabled the material to retain its nanofiber structure while simultaneously regulating the oxidation state of Ru in RuO2, lengthening the Ru-O bond. This effectively mitigated the over-oxidation of Ru. These material optimizations, combined with the significantly enhanced Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM), synergistically accelerated the water dissociation kinetics in acidic media while ensuring robust catalyst stability. Under the optimized calcination conditions (400°C for 2 h), the resulting catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of merely 59.55 mV dec−1, outperforming commercial RuO2.",
