Steric hindrance of coordination of the substrate to the catalyst retards the reaction. Key words: cobalt; dioxygenase reaction model; indole oxidation; oxygenation; Schiff base complexes Introduction One of the most important metabolic pathways of tryptophan in living organisms is dioxygenolysis of the indole ring to give N-formylkynurenine, which is catalyzed by tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) [ 1 ] . As mimics for the TDO reaction, metal complex catalyzed oxygenations of 3-substituted indoles have been reported [ 2-6 ] . Among the model reactions, Co (salen) has been shown to give the greatest selectivity [ 7 ] . The present work deals with the oxygenation of 3-methylindole catalyzed by a series of cobalt (II) Schiff complexes [ Coll (SB) ] electronically and sterically designed in order to find out which factor of Coll (SB) is essential for the highly selective oxygenation of indoles. It is found that the product is always only 2-(N-formylamino) acetophenone with any CoII (SB) employed, but the reaction rate depended largely on structure of the complex; the E value as well as the shape of CoII (SB) is important for the catalytic activity. The mechanism reported in the previous paper [ 7 ] is consistent with the present results. *Corresponding authors. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 118 A. Nishinaga et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)117-123 Results and discussion Three types of Con (SB): Con (L') -Co\" (L), Co\" (L') -Co\" (L') and Coil (L10)-Con (L15) , were prepared by the method described (see Experimental). The first type includes Co (salen) derivatives in which electronically arranged substituents are at the 5 and 5' positions of the aromatic rings. The second type has additional t-butyl groups at the 3 and 3' positions. In the third type, the amine part of Co (salen) is modified. Any modification of the structure of Co (salen) shifts the E (Co\"/CoIII) value in NN-dimethylformamide (DMF) to more positive values, except for Co (L13). The unexpected CV results have been rationalized by assuming that the change in E is more sensitive to the DMF coordination than to the substituent effect: the coordination of DMF is sterically hindered by any substitution at the Co (SB) [ 8 ] . It has been shown that the oxygenation of 3-substituted indoles catalyzed by Coll' (salen) (X) [ X = t-BuOO, t-BuO, OH ] results in quantitative formation of 2- (N-formylamino) acetophenone derivatives in CH2C12, but a complicated mixture is obtained in the reaction using Coil (salen) or MeOH as solvent [ 7 ] . Therefore, in the present work the reaction was carried out using CoIil (salen) (X) in CHZC12.

The reaction was monitored by gas chromatography to determine the reaction rate on the basis of the consumption of the substrate. TLC analyses of the reaction mixtures showed the formation of 2- A. Nishinaga et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)117-123 119 (N-formylamino) acetophenone as the sole product during the course of the reactions. Further, the initial reaction rates were maximum and found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics, except for Co(Ll ). The observed rate constants are given in Table 1 together with E (Cot,/CoIII). No clear-cut correlation between the nature of the substituent Y and the reaction rate observed with the first type of Con (SB ), Co (Ll)-Co (L4 ), (Table 1) suggests no significant effect of substituent at the 5 position on the reaction rate.

Since the introduction of t-Bu groups to the 3 and 3' positions shifts the E (COII/CoIII) to more positive values, it may generally be concluded that the more positive E (CO/Coin) results in the higher catalytic activity. Interestingly, the t-Bu groups do not cause steric hindrance for the catalytic activity, even though the t-Bu groups hinder the coordination of DMF as seen in the CV experiment. This inconsistency may be rationalized by assuming that cis coordination of the substrate to the anionic ligand (OR) in Coin (SB) (OR), in which the salen ligand must have a twisted conformation so that the steric hindrance by t-Bu groups diminishes, is significant for acceleration of the reaction, whereas under the conditions of the CV experiment two DMF molecules are coordinated at both axial positions of the planar Co (SB) [ 10 ] .

The decrease in the reaction rate with complexes Co (Lll)-Co (L14) is due to the steric hindrance by the salen ligand for the cis coordination of the substrate. The significant catalytic activity of Co (L15), whose SB ligand has a rigid planar structure, indicates that the twisted conformation of Co (SB) is not always essential for the catalysis, suggesting that the fundamental step of the present catalysis is an acid-base reaction between the substrate and Coin (SB) (OR) to form a substrate anion, into which diogygen is incorporated [ 7,12 ] . An increase in acidity of the substrate due to the coordination facilitates the innersphere proton transfer from the substrate to the anionic ligand (OR) resulting in acceleration of the reaction. Electron transfer from the coordinated substrate to the Coin center does not occur, because neither oxidation of the substrate nor the reduction of Colic to Co\" was observed under a nitrogen atmosphere. These findings are consistent with the mechanism proposed in a previous paper [ 7 ] (Scheme 1), and the rate controlling step in the catalytic cycle depends on the structure of the SB ligand: the ateric effect of the SB ligand should appear at the coordination step of the substrate (kl ), and the E should affect the innersphere deprotonation of the substrate (k2 ). The unusual acceleration observed in the reaction with Co (Ll ) is not fully understood at the moment, but a different mechanism may be considered for this reaction, because an induction period (40 min) was observed and a complicated mixture of products was obtained, although Co(Ll ) was rapidly oxidized with t-Bu00H to the corresponding Coin (SB) (OR) at the initial stage. Experimental Methods The 1H NMR spectra were determined with a JEOL-PMX60si spectrometer. GLC analyses were performed with a Shimazu Gas Chromatograph GC12A, which was connected to a Shimazu C-R6A Chromatopac recording system. A. Nishirsaga et al./J. Mot. Catal. 83 (1993)117-123 121 Materials The cobalt (II) Schiff base complexes were synthesized by known methods: complegation using Co (OAc) 2 - 4H20 of the appropriate Schiff bases, which were prepared by condensation of the corresponding diamines and salicylaldehyde derivatives: Co (Ll) [12], Co (L2) [13], Co (L3) [12], Co (L4) [12], Co (L6) [14],Co(L6) [15],Co(Ll ) [16],Co(Lll) [17],Co(L12) [ 12 ], Co (L\") [12], and Co (L15) [18]. Complexes Co (LS), Co (L'), Co(L9), and Co(L14) were newly prepared by the conventional method in this work. The synthesis of Co (Lll) was reported [ 17 ], but no description about the desired amine was given. A mixture of dl- and meso-2,3-butanediamine was prepared by a published method [ 19 ] , and the dl-isomer was separated by the reported method [ 20 ] . Schiff base L9 was prepared by the conventional condensation between 1,2-diaminoethane and the corresponding aldehyde which had been synthesized by the tert-butylation (t-BuOH/polyphosphoric acid/phosphoric acid/ 70 C) [ 21 ] of 4-chlorophenol followed by the Duff formylation [ 22 ] . Aldehydes for the Schiff bases L5 and L' were synthesized by formylation using the paraformaldehyde/SnC14/BU3N system [23]. The analytical data for (L\"), n=1-15, and the complexes Co (L5 ), Co (L' ), and Co (L14 ) are given below. Ll: Yield 93%; m.p. 166-167.5 C (lit.

Kinetics: typical procedure To a solution of 3-methylindole (10 mM ), CoIll (L) (OH) (1 mM ), prepared by the oxidation of Con (L) with t-Bu00H (0.5 mM) in situ, in dichloromethane (100 ml) was added octadecane (0.10 g) as an internal standard. The reaction vessel was then filled with 1 atm. oxygen and put in a thermo regulated water bath (25.0 0.1 C) . Aliquots (0.6 ml) were taken out at halfhour intervals, put on a short silica gel column (5 mm X 10 mm) packed with 0.2 ml of ethyl acetate, and eluted with ethyl acetate (0.2 ml X 4) to remove the metal catalyst. The eluent was analyzed by GLC. The results are given in Table 1. Acknowledgement The present work was financially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (No. 04225233) .

Dioxygenolysis of 3-methylindole catalyzed by a series of cobalt(II) Schiff base complexes electronically and sterically designed gives 2-(N-formylamino)acetophenone as the sole product, but the reaction rate depended largely on the structure of the complex: the more positive E° (CoII/ CoIII) brings about the more catalytic activity. Steric hindrance of coordination of the substrate to the catalyst retards the reaction. Keywords cobalt dioxygenase reaction model indole oxidation oxygenation Schiffbase complexes References 1 P.
