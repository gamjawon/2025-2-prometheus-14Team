DELGASS School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907 (U.S.A.) Summary In situ Mossbauer experiments are reported on silica-supported bi- metallic FeRu and FeRh catalysts in various gaseous environments. The reduced catalysts contain iron in two states: zero-valent iron in FeRu or FeRh alloy particles, and trivalent iron in a highly dispersed iron oxide. Chemisorption of CO or NH3 at 295 K causes reduction to Fe24 of some of the Fe3\"1\" in the bimetallic catalysts. Preoxidation enhances the amount of Fe2'1\" that can be produced by subsequent CO exposure. Implications of these results on the structure of the catalyst are discussed. Introduction Catalytic research on well-characterized alloys has contributed signif- icantly to our fundamental understanding of catalytically active sites [1, 2]. It has also revealed that alloying provides a means to optimize catalytic properties. More difficult to characterize, but of great practical interest, are small particle alloys on a support, i.e. supported bimetallic clusters [3]. Out- standing examples of industrially successful bimetallic systems are supported PtRe and Ptir reforming catalysts [4]. In the field of synthesis gas reactions, bimetallic clusters such as FeRu/Si02 and FeRh/Si02 have shown interesting selectivity improvements [5-9]. Investigation of the structure of supported bimetallic cluster catalysts is seriously hindered by their small dimensions (1 - 3 nm) and by the pres- ence of a support. Iron-containing bimetallic clusters have the advantage that they can be studied with Mossbauer spectroscopy. This technique has suc- cessfully been applied to verify clustering of the metals in supported FePt, FePd, FeRu, Feir and FeRh catalysts [10 -18]. Clear evidence for clustering *Present address: Owens-Corning Fiberglas, Technical Center, Granville, OH 43023. **Present address: B.F. Goodrich Co., Research and Development Center, Brecksville, OH 44141. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 286 was found in the enhanced reducibility at low temperature of the iron in the proximity of the noble metal, and the absence in the Mossbauer spectra of signals which are commonly observed with monometallic supported iron catalysts. Although clustering of the metals can easily be recognized, a thorough understanding of the structure of these bimetallic catalysts has not yet evolved. In this paper we report Mossbauer experiments which are relevant to the understanding of the structure of silica-supported bimetallic FeRu and FeRh catalysts. Our results suggest that the catalysts contain iron in two states: zero-valent iron in an alloy and iron(III) ions in a highly dispersed, irreducible oxide. Experimental The catalysts were prepared by pore volume impregnation. Aqueous solutions containing the desired amounts of Fe(N03)3- 9H20 (Mallinckrodt) and RuC^-JcH^O or RhC^-^cH^O (Strem Chemicals) were added dropwise to the Si02 support (Cab-o-Sil, EH-5, 310 m2 g~1) under frequent stirring until the incipient wetness point was reached. The FeRh/SiO^ catalysts contained 1.7 wt.% iron and 3.3 wt.% rhodium. The FeRu/SiOz catalysts have the com- position indicated in wt.%. The impregnated samples were dried in air at 295 K for a few days, and next in vacuum at 425 K for several hours. For Mossbauer experiments, quantities of about 300 mg of catalyst were pressed into a self-supporting disc with a diameter of 20 mm. Spectra at room tem- perature were obtained in situ in reactor systems that have been described elsewhere [19-21]. The constant acceleration Mossbauer spectrometer was equipped with a \"Co-in-Rh source. Isomer shifts (IS) are reported relative to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Reduction of the catalysts occurred in flowing H; (100 ml min~1) at 400 K for 0.5 h and at 725 K for 6 h. Chemisorption experiments were carried out by exposing the reduced catalysts to a flow of 5% NH3 in He at 300 K for 15 min, or to 50 ml min~1 CO at 300 K for 0.5 h. Results The Mossbauer spectra of reduced FeRu/SiO; and FeRh/SiOs consist of a single line with an isomer shift which corresponds to the bulk alloy, and a peak at higher velocity [5,14,16-18]. To investigate the nature of the latter component, a series of FeRu/SiO; catalysts with different dispersions was prepared by varying metal loading, changing the metal-support contact- ing procedure, and sintering the catalyst in 0^ at 900 K before reduction. X-ray line-broadening provided an estimate of the diameter of the alloy particles formed after H^ reduction. Although this method tends to over- estimate particle sizes [22], we can at least rely on the diameters obtained 287 to classify the samples with respect to relative dispersion. Figure 1 clearly indicates, in agreement with Vannice et al. [5], that the catalysts with the largest FeRu particles show mainly the single peak of the alloy, whereas the peak at higher velocity becomes more pronounced when the dispersion in- creases. Thus, the high velocity peak is associated with a surface phase. Further evidence for the surface character of this high velocity peak is supplied by Mossbauer spectra of the FeRu/SiO; catalysts after chemisorp- tion of NH3, shown in Fig. 2. For easy comparison, the spectra of the re- duced catalysts have been included also. It is seen that NHa adsorption re- sults in the formation of a broad peak at about 2 mm s~1. Such peaks belong to a doublet due to Fe2\"*\" with the left peak in the 0 mm s~1 region of the spectrum. This Fe2\"*\" phase has been formed at the expense of the high veloc- ity peak in the spectrum of the reduced catalyst. The fact that NH3 chemi- sorption affects the high velocity peak, suggests that it corresponds to a sur- face phase. Since the resonant absorption in the spectrum around 0 mm s~1 has also decreased, it must be concluded that the high velocity peak in the spectrum of the catalyst under H; belongs to a doublet, and that the total spectral area decreased after NH3 treatment. The loss of spectral area and the associated decrease in recoil-free fraction after NH3 adsorption on highly dis- persed iron is not uncommon [23,24]. The Mossbauer parameters of the 23 -3-2 Doppler velocity (\"^/s) Fig. 1. (left) In situ Mossbauer spectra of a series of reduced FeRu/SiO^ catalysts of dif- ferent dispersion.

The alloy peak remains essentially unchanged after NH3 exposure, indicating that the chemical state of the majority of the iron atoms in the alloy is not affected by NHs. More support for the assignment of the Fe3\"1\" doublet to a surface phase can be obtained from Mossbauer spectra at cryogenic temperatures, as will be shown elsewhere [25]. There, it is found that the spectra of reduced FeRh/SiOz at 295 and 77 K both consist of an FeRh alloy singlet and a Fe3\"1\" doublet, but the relative spectral intensity of the Fe3\"1\" doublet is substantial- ly higher at 77 K. This means that the corresponding Fe3'1\" phase has a rela- tively low Debye temperature, which is another indication that the Fe3\"'\" doublet is associated with a surface phase [25]. -5 0 5 10 Doppler Velocity (mm/s) Fig. 3.

Composition of the Mossbauer spectra in Fig. 3. Mossbauer spectra of a reduced FeRh/SiO; catalyst before and after chemisorption of CO are shown in Fig. 3(a and b). The spectrum of the reduced catalyst consists, as before, of a single line for Fe in the FeRh alloy and a doublet of Fe3\"1\". The spectrum of the catalyst after chemisorption of CO shows, in addition to the Fe and Fe3\"1\" contributions already present in the reduced catalyst, a doublet due to Fe2''' ions. In the computer analysis of the spectra, it was assumed that the positional parameters of the Fe and Fe3\"1\" are not affected by the chemisorption of CO. It appears then that the Fe24 doublet in the spectrum of FeRh/SiO; after exposure to CO at room temperature has been formed at the expense of the Fe3\"1\" doublet in the reduced catalyst under H;, confirming once more that the Fe3'1' doublet corresponds indeed to a surface phase. This effect is irreversible in the sense that removal of CO from the gas phase does not alter the Mossbauer spec- trum of the catalyst. Exposing the catalyst to air at room temperature transforms most of the Fe and all Fe2\"1' into Fe3\"'\" ions (Fig. 3c). Chemisorption of CO on this air-exposed catalyst again results in the formation of an Fe2\"'\" doublet, but this sample shows substantially more Fe2'1\" than does the reduced catalyst under CO. Mass spectral analysis of CO pulse experiments on oxidized FeRh/ SiO; did not detect CO; evolution at room temperature [26]. The redox trends are clearly illustrated in Fig. 4, where the compositions of the spectra in Fig. 3 are displayed as histograms. Parameters of the spectra in Fig. 3 are given in Table 1. Discussion The Mossbauer spectra of our SiOa-supported FeRu and FeRh catalysts and Garten's supported FeRu, FePd and FePt catalysts show many similar features [5,13 -17]. However, an important difference exists in the inter- pretation. As explained before, the spectra of the reduced catalyst consist of a single line due to the alloy particles and a doublet which corresponds to a highly dispersed phase. The isomer shift and quadrupole splitting of the latter fall entirely in the range of high-spin Fe3\"'\" compounds. Hence, we 290 TABLE 1 Mossbauer parameters of FeRh/SiO; (see Fig. 3) Treatment Iron state /S\" QS A\" (mms\"') (mms\"1) (a.u.) ^2,725 K Fe Fe^ 0.35 0.68 1.00 0.18 0.24 CO,295 K Fe Fe2-1-Fe34- 0.351.48 0.68 2.20 1.00 0.15 0.13 0.09 air, 295 K Fe0 Fe^ 0.35 0.63 0.90 0.06 0.46 CO, 295 K Fe0 Fe24-Fe3-^ 0.35 1.48 0.63 2.21 0.60 0.04 0.23 0.10 ^IS: isomer shift, QS: quadrupole splitting, A; resonant absorption area; accuracies: IS: 0.04 mms-l,QS: 0.06 mm s~1,A: 0.01. assign this doublet to a highly dispersed, irreducible iron(III) oxide, which cannot be reduced by H; at temperatures up to 775 K [17,18]. Lam and Garten [14], on the other hand, have proposed that the doublet could also correspond to zero-valent iron atoms at sites of low symmetry on the surface of the bimetallic clusters. They explain the unusually high isomer shift for Fe by invoking a lower electron density at these sites which, they suggest, could be the result of a higher effective atomic volume for iron at the surface. The chemisorption experiments reported in this paper help to discrim- inate between the two interpretations. Exposure of the reduced catalysts to NH3 or CO caused the partial conversion of the surface phase into Fe2\"1\" ions. In Garten's interpretation, this process would correspond to an oxidation of Fe atoms on the surface of the alloy to Fe2\"1\" ions by NH3 or by CO. Oxida- tion by these reagents seems unlikely. In our interpretation, the conversion of the surface phase corresponds to a reduction of Fe3\"1\" to Fe2\"1\" by NN3 and CO. Although the reduction of the finely dispersed iron(III) oxide by ad- sorbed gases at room temperature may at first sight be surprising, we note that this process has an undisputed precedent in the well-known partial reduction by H2 of iron in oxidized bimetallic catalysts, for which no doubt exists that the iron is initially in the 3+ oxidation state [5, 8,10 -18]. Garten has argued convincingly that the enhanced reducibility of iron is direct evidence of the noble metal proximity and influence. In a recent study which combined temperature-programmed reduction, oxidation and in situ Mossbauer spectroscopy, it was shown that exposure of reduced FeRh/Si02 to air results in the oxidation of almost all of the iron, but that rhodium remains primarily reduced [18]. Apparently, reduced rhodium provides the 291 Reduced SiO, under CO SiO, exposed to air II alloy ilgl irreducible iron in oxide U| Fe^* containing phase KSSJI reducible oxide Fig. 5. Schematic representation of silica-supported bimetallic FeRu and FeRh catalysts. sites where H^, NH3 and CO are activated such that reduction of iron can occur at relatively low temperatures. Two structural arrangements of the two iron components can be envisioned. First, suppose that the well-dispersed Fe(III) oxide forms a layer which covers the FeRu or FeRh alloy. Although the underlying alloy would perhaps be able to account for the unusual chemical behavior of this oxide, we find it difficult to understand why an Fe34\" state should be stabilized on top of a reduced alloy particle under H^. We therefore reject this possibility. The following interpretation seems more realistic. Assume that a dis- tribution of particle sizes occurs in the reduced catalyst. A fraction of the particles is too small to be reduced, due to nucleation problems. Nucleation inhibition as a result of a high dispersion is a common phenomenon in silica- supported oxides of iron and nickel [27]. Furthermore, Guczi [16] has found that in FeRu/SiOa catalysts with metal loading below 1%, where small particle sizes are expected, reduction of Fe3'1\" to Fe2\"1\" is suppressed, in con- trast to Fe/SiC>2 catalysts where this partial reduction occurs even at loadings as low as 0.1%. Thus the small irreducible particles give rise to the Fe3'*\" doublet in the Mossbauer spectrum of the reduced FeRh/SiOz catalyst. Particles which are larger than a certain critical size do not suffer from 292 nucleation problems, and hence these particles can easily be reduced to an alloy. A schematic representation of this model and the changes which occur on chemisorption of CO or exposure to air are given in Fig. 5. The model in Fig. 5 is strongly supported by the CO chemisorption re- sults shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The model shows that chemisorption of CO on the air-exposed catalyst yields significantly more Fe2\"1\" than does CO chemi- sorption on the reduced catalyst, in agreement with the results of Fig. 4. This result would be hard to understand in a model in which the Fe3\"1\"- containing phase covers the alloy, since oxidation of such particles should not lead to a larger number of Fe3\"1\" ions which are accessible to CO. Note that not all Fe3\"1\" ions in the reduced catalyst are affected by chemisorption of CO or NH3. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the Fe3\"'\" ions play a role in anchoring the alloy particles to the silica support. As we mentioned earlier, supported bimetallic cluster catalysts which consist of iron and a noble Group VIII metal exhibit Mossbauer spectra which are very similar. We therefore suggest that the validity of the model in Fig. 5 is not limited to FeRu/SiOz and FeRh/SiO;, catalysts alone. Investiga- tions to test the model for silica-supported FePd, Feir and FePt catalysts are in progress. We note also that the implicitly assumed separation between the irreducible iron(III) oxide and the alloy particles is not essential. A model in which the two phases are in close proximity with each other would explain the Mossbauer results presented here as well.

        "dc:description": "In situ Mössbauer experiments are reported on silica-supported bimetallic FeRu and FeRh catalysts in various gaseous environments. The reduced catalysts contain iron in two states: zero-valent iron in FeRu or FeRh alloy particles, and trivalent iron in a highly dispersed iron oxide. Chemisorption of CO or NH3 at 295 K causes reduction to Fe2+ of some of the Fe3+ in the bimetallic catalysts. Preoxidation enhances the amount of Fe2+ that can be produced by subsequent CO exposure. Implications of these results on the structure of the catalyst are discussed.",
