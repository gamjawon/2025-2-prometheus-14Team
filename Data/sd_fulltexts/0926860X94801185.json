Box 5, Taedok Science Town, Taejon 305-343, South Korea \"Department of Chemical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taedok Science Town, Taejon 305-701, South Korea (Received 30 March 1993, revised manuscript received 24 September 1993) Abstract The effects of transition metal addition to a commercial CoMo / y-A1203 catalyst on the hydrotreatment of atmospheric residual oil were investigated using a continuous flow fixed bed reactor operated at 420 and 6.9 MPa. Nickel, ruthenium and tungsten were used as an additive to the catalyst. Catalyst performances were evaluated in terms of activities and initial deactivation rates in sulfur removal, conversion of heavier to lighter oil fractions, and removal of asphaltenes. Among the metal additive-modified CoMo/ y-A1203 catalysts, NiCoMo/ y-A1203 and WCoMo/ y-A1203 showed a more improved reaction performance than commercial CoMo/ y-A1203 whereas RuCoMo/ y-A1203 did not. The performance improvements observed after addition of nickel or tungsten were thought to be mainly a result of the promotion effect on the catalytic activity in hydrodesulfurization. Significant improvements of catalyst performance were obtained by the addition of a small amount of tungsten (0.5 wt.-%). Tungsten was considered to be promising as a secondary promoter of CoMo/y-A1203.

Introduction Petroleum residual oil is generally undesirable as fuel or feedstock for most refining processes because of its large content of contaminants such as sulfur, nitrogen, metals and asphaltenes included in the heavy oil fraction. The growing need for better quality petroleum 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSD/0926-860X(93) E0227-4 196 D K. Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 195-210 fractions has increased the significance of catalytic hydroprocessing of heavy oils, in which removing contaminants and lowering the molecular weight of oil fractions occur simultaneously throughout the catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodemetallization (HDM) and hydrocracking (HCR) [ 1,2]. From a practical point of view, catalyst performance could be evaluated at the level of reaction activity and activity maintenance which are generally determined by many factors; the physical and chemical properties of the support (surface area, porosity, pore size distribution, acidity, etc.), the preparation and activation procedure, kind of metals, and relative content of the metals impregnated on support. Conventional hydrotreating catalysts usually consist of a pair of transition metal sulfides supported on a y-A1203, a promoter and an active component, i.e., CoMo, NiMo and NiW. There have been many reports on improving activity and activity maintenance of the hydrotreating catalyst by adding a new element to the conventional types of transition metal sulfide pairs or replacing promoters with elements different from the conventional one. The elements which have been tried could be classified into three categories according to their major effects on the individual catalytic system. Firstly, metallic elements which have some intrinsic activities for hydrotreating reactions were employed to expect some secondary synergy effect, for example, Ti to Mo [ 3 ] and CoMo [ 3-5 ] , Ni to CoMo [ 5-10 ] , Zn to Mo [3,11] and CoMo [4,12],RutoMo [13,14] and CoMo [15],FetoMo [3,16,17] and CoMo [ 18]. Secondly, non-metallic elements such as P [ 19-23] and F [4,24-26] have been used. It was reported that these elements increased the dispersion and sulfidability of the metallic components by changing the surface properties of the y-A1203 support. Thirdly, for the purpose of extending the catalyst life by decreasing the acidity of the catalytic materials which is known to be a main cause of deactivation by coke deposition, alkali metals such as Na [4,27], Ca [4,28], Mg [4] and K [29] have been used as additives to the conventional hydrotreating catalysts. However, the published works of interest were accomplished mainly on model compound reactions such as thiophene HDS under atmospheric pressure. In this work, such typical transition metals as nickel, ruthenium and tungsten known to have intrinsic HDS activity were selected as an additive to a CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst, which has been widely used in the commercial HDS of heavy oil by virtue of its high HDS activity. The effects of the metal addition to the CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst on the reaction performance were investigated throughout hydrotreating experiments for atmospheric residual oil using a continuous flow fixed bed reactor under high pressure. The reaction performances of the catalysts were evaluated in terms of activity and the degree of initial deactivation in the hydrotreating reactions with regard to sulfur removal, conversion of heavy oil fractions to light fractions, and removal of asphaltenes. 2. Experimental 2.1. Feedstock The distillation residue obtained from the atmospheric distillation tower at Yukong Refinery Co. in Korea was used as feed oil. The residual oil originated from the crude mixture of Iranian Heavy (70%) and Geisum (30%). Its properties are shown in Table 1. D.K.

Catalysts A commercial CoMo/y-A1203 (Amocat l A) catalyst supplied as cylindrical extrudates (diameter 1.6 mm, length 3 mm) was used as a base catalyst. The extrudates were crushed and sieved into particles of 35/45 mesh size (mean diameter 0.42 mm). The impregnation of either nickel, ruthenium or tungsten on the calcined CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst was achieved by the incipient wetness method with aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate, ruthenium(III) chloride or ammonium tungstate, respectively. The transition metal-impregnated catalysts were first dried at room temperature and overnight at 110, and then calcined in dry air at 500 for 5 h. The metal contents of the catalysts were determined by atomic absorption analysis. BET surface areas and pore size distributions of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption at - 196 using a Quantachrome Autosorb-I. Specifications of the catalysts are given in Table 2. Prepared oxide catalysts were activated by in-situ sulphidation using a gas mixture of HZS (10 vol.-%) and HZ just before the beginning of the reaction. The sulfidation was done at 450 during 3 h. 198 D.K. Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 195-210 2.3. Apparatus and reaction procedure Experiments were carried out in a continuous mode using the reactor system as shown in Fig. 1. A fixed bed reactor, consisting of a stainless steel tube of 11 mm I.D. and 500 mm length, was specially designed to avoid channeling and axial dispersion [ 30] . Catalyst particles (3.2 g) mixed with ceramic beads of mean diameter 0.4 mm were loaded into the middle of the reactor so that the total volume of catalyst was 10 ml. Ceramic balls of mean diameter 1.8 mm were placed in the top and bottom parts of the reactor to obtain an evenly distributed flow of reactants. At the outlet of the reactor, one small and two large pressure vessels were installed. The small vessel was used as a sampling bottle for collection of product oil sample. The sampling bottle was located as close as possible to the reactor outlet. The other two pressure vessels were installed in series; the first for the separation of oil from the gas and the second for the withdrawal of oil from the reaction system during reaction. Reactor heating was accomplished mainly by an infrared radiation furnace and by two heating tapes wrapped around both ends of the reactor. The temperatures of the catalyst bed were measured by three thermocouples installed axially in the reactor and controlled by regulating the voltages supplied to three separate heaters to obtain an isothermal temperature distribution. Pressure of the reactor was regulated by using a back-pressure regulator (BPR). The flow-rate of pressurized hydrogen to the reactor was regulated by means of a mass flow controller and a forward pressure regulator (FPR). The feed oil was stored and heated to 60 in a graduated glass cylinder immersed into a silicon oil bath, and fed to the reactor via a piston pump with discharge capacity of 0-150 ml /h at 6.9 MPa.

Analysis of products The analysis of liquid product samples was done to measure the content of sulfur, content of asphaltenes (n-pentane insolubles) and the chromatographic distribution of hydrocarbons constituting deasphalted oil fractions, i.e., maltenes. Sulfur was analysed using an Antek 7000S Sulfur Analyser. Asphaltene contents were determined from the n-pentane insoluble fractions by pressure filtration of the mixture of n-pentane and oil using a membrane filter of 1 tt.m pore size. The content of oil mixed with 40-fold its volume of n-pentane solvent by weight had to be sonificated for complete dissolution of oil into the solvent prior to filtration. Conversions of sulfur and asphaltenes were defined as follows: Conversion (%) _ Content in feed (wt.-%) - Content in product (wt.-%) Content in feed (wt.-%) The hydrocarbon distributions of the deasphalted oil samples, mixed with n-pentane (HPLC grade), were obtained from the gas-chromatographic simulated distillation using a GC, HP5890 II equipped with a flame ionization detector and a HP- I capillary column (length 80 70 60 c _o 50 O c U 40 30 20 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Time on-stream(hr) Fig. 2.

About 1.0 Al of sample was injected without split under the carrier gas (helium) flow-rate of 15 cm'/min. The oven temperature was increased from 40 to 300 with a rate of 8/min and maintained at 300 for 10 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reactions over CoMoly-A1203 catalyst Fig. 2 shows the conversion of sulfur and asphaltenes with time on-stream. A rapid initial deactivation of CoMo/y-A1203 catalyst was observed. It was reported [31] that the initial deactivation of the catalyst mainly resulted from the accumulation of coke on the catalyst by which the access of reactants to catalytic sites might be blocked, and that such an initial deactivation of catalyst occurred rapidly during the first 20 h of the run. Fig. 3 shows the relative amounts of cleasphalted oil fractions by carbon number groups of the constituent hydrocarbons with time-on-stream. It is shown that light hydrocarbon fractions were produced in fair amounts, which decreased with time-on-stream. The conversions of sulfur and asphaltenes, as shown in Fig. 2, were similar to each other. Hence, it can be understood that a linear relationship should exist between the conversion of sulfur and that of asphaltenes. A similar relationship was also observed between the conversion of sulfur and that of heavier to lighter maltene fractions. D.K.

Conversion of sulfur in CoMo/y-A'203 and the selected metal-added catalysts: (O) CoMo, () Ni(l.9)CoMO, (O) Ru(2.1)COMOand ( W(2.0)CoMo. In the case of CoMo/y-A1203 catalyst, it has been understood that the HCR activity is relatively weak compared with the strong HDS activity [4,32]. Considering of the insignificant role of the catalyst in the HCR reaction, it can be deduced that the conversion of heavier to lighter oil fractions should proceed as well during the course of the HDS reaction for the hydrocarbon fractions, maltenes or asphaltenes, containing sulfur. Analysis of the maltene fractions of the feed oil showed that they mostly consist of aliphatic hydrocarbons whose carbon numbers ranged from ca. 11 to ca. 42 by GC. Heavier aliphatics containing sulfur were converted to lighter aliphatics as a result of hydrogenolysis throughout the HDS reaction. Thus, when the catalyst was so deactivated that the conversion of sulfur decreased to about 30%, there was a negligible conversion of heavier to lighter maltene fractions, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. With respect to asphaltene conversion, it was reported [33-35] that the conversion of asphaltenes to oils was initiated by the removal of vanadium, and that the further progress of the conversion resulted from the cleavage and the removal of weak bonds linked to heteroatoms such as sulfur. Such heteroatoms as vanadium and sulfur contained in feed oil were more or less concentrated in the asphaltene fractions, as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the similarity between the conversion trends of sulfur and asphaltenes, as shown in Fig. 2, could be explained by the fact that the conversion of asphaltenes was subject to the sulfur removal which was related to the HDS activity of the catalyst. 202 D.K.

Effects of the selected metal addition to CoMoly-A1203 catalyst Fig. 4 shows the effect of the addition of selected metals to a CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst on sulfur conversions with time-on-stream. In the case of NiCoMo and WCOMo catalysts, sulfur conversions were higher than those in CoMo during the run of 30 h. However, there was little effect of ruthenium addition to CoMo/ y-A'203 as far as HDS was concerned. The conversions of asphaltenes are shown in Fig. 5. A higher conversion of asphaltenes was obtained by WCoMo than by NiCoMo. The conversion of heavier to lighter oil fractions by WCoMo was the highest, as shown in Fig. 6. The deactivation patterns in the conversion of sulfur, the conversion of asphaltenes and the conversion of heavier to lighter oil fractions are similar. Hence, the general deactivation trends of the catalyst in its various hydrotreating reactions can be represented in terms of its HDS activity change with time-on-stream. Fig. 7 shows the comparative deactivation rates of HDS activities, obtained from the conversion data fit to the modified Voorhies correlation proposed by Mahoney [36] as follows: X,=X, exp( -b t' /2), where X, is the conversion at on-stream time, t, Xo is the initial conversion at t=0, determined from the intercept of a straight line when In (X,) is plotted against t1/2, and b is the deactivation rate constant. This type of semiempirical correlation. has been extensively employed in supported COMo hydrotreating catalysts [37]. As shown in Fig. 7, the linear plot corresponded well to this deactivation model.

They found that RuMo/ A1203 was active for the HDS of thiophene, but no better than the conventional CoMo or NiMo catalyst. They also found that synergy between ruthenium and molybdenum was observed only for the catalysts which had not been calcined after the addition of ruthenium. In subsequent work [ 14], they came to the conclusion that the calcination of RuMo/A1203 resulted in the formation of new Ru-O-Mo species, in which ruthenium played a negative role by withdrawing electrons from molybdenum, leading to poisoning of the MOS2 phase after sulfidation. However, Hirschon et al. [ 15] reported that RuCoMo/y-A1203 catalyst D.K.

In our work, ruthenium (III) chloride was tried as an additive to the CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst, in which molybdenum was already promoted with cobalt. In this RuCoMo/ y-A1203, it is necessary to consider the effects of chloride residue and the sulfiding extent of ruthenium oxide (Ru02) on the catalyst activity. The addition of a small amount of chloride (0.5 wt.-%) to CoMo/y-A1203 was reported [4] to somewhat promote HDS and HCR activities of the catalyst. Residual chloride in our calcined RuCoMo/ y-A1203 was measured to be 0.18 wt.-% by ion chromatographic analysis. RU02 in the calcined RuCoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst were expected to be fully transformed to ruthenium sulfide because the sulfiding temperature (450) in this study was higher than that in the study of Mitchell et al. [ 14] who proved, by XPS analysis, the fact that RU02 in calcined RuMo/y-A1203 was completely sulfided under a flow of HZS(10%) /HZ at 400 for 4 h. In spite of a possible promoting effect of residual chloride and complete sulfiding of ruthenium oxide, the catalytic activity of RuCoMo/y-A1203 did not change, indicating that ruthenium induced no promoting effect due to the calcination step during the catalyst preparation. The introduction of nickel to CoMo/y-A1203 has been generally proved to enhance the HDS activity of the catalyst. However, an inconsistency in the optimum composition of promoters exhibiting a relatively high HDS activity was reported [ 6] , due to the differences in the catalyst preparation conditions such as the type of support, the methods of impreg- 206 D.K.

It was reported [8-10] that the optimum composition of promoters was related to the relative surface coverage of the two promoters which was dependent on the calcination temperature employed. However, the promotional effect on the thiophene HDS activities was not very high and the surface composition of the promoters showing the highest HDS activities was not clear [8-10]. In addition to this, it was reported [42] that the addition of nickel to a silica-supported CoMo catalyst resulted in a decrease rather than an increase in HDS activity. 3.3. Effect of tungsten content in WCoMoly-A1203 Catalyst In this study, the use of tungsten as an additive to CoMo/y-A1203 improved the catalyst performance, as shown in Figs. 4-7. This might result from the interaction between cobalt and tungsten. Such an activity promotion is plausible from the recent results [43] that alumina-supported CoW catalyst containing only a small amount of cobalt showed a hydrotreating performance for coal-derived liquids at least as high as did NiW-based catalysts. Tungsten has been mainly employed as an active component promoted with nickel in the HDS catalyst, but little attention has been paid to its possible function as a promoter in the a. n o.

Fig. 8 increased sharply, decreased and then increased slightly as the tungsten content increased. This can be explained from the effects on both the catalytic activity increase and the decreases in pore size and surface area as a result of the addition of tungsten to CoMo/ y-A1203. As the tungsten content in WCoMo/y-A1203 catalysts increased, the number of newly formed active sites (COWS) might be increased, whereas the median pore diameter (MPD) and the surface area of the catalyst decreased inevitably as shown in Table 2. It was reported [45-47] that the intraparticle diffusion of the heavy oil fractions of large molecular sizes were largely affected by the MPD of catalysts. Especially, Kobayashi et al. [ 45 ] reported in the hydrotreating of Khafji residual oil that the level of asphaltene removal was very sensitively affected by the pore size variations of the catalyst in the range of the MPD from 70 A to 150 A, and that the maximum removal was attained at the MPD of about 150 A. In contrast to the asphaltene removal, the conversion of sulfur was maximum at MPD less than 90A [45] or between 70 and 80 A [46] and decreased with the increase of MPD up to 150 A [ 45 ] . The MPD of CoMo/y-A1203 employed in this study was 102 .A as shown in Table 2. Since the sulfur compounds are relatively uniformly distributed over all fractions of the residual oil, and as a result, the average molecular size of the sulfur compounds is small compared with the asphaltene molecules, HDS reaction rates are less influenced by intraparticle diffusional resistance than the asphaltene conversion case [ 45 ] . It can be thought that the sulfur conversion is more dependent on the catalyst surface area than on the pore size as far as desulfurization is limited to the conversion of about 70-80% D.K. Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 109 (1994) 195-210 209 [ 47 ] . As shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10, the apparent activity increased sharply with the 0.5 wt.-% addition of tungsten. With this addition of tungsten, the surface area and MPD of the catalyst decreased from 235 m2/ g and 102 A to 232 m2/ g and 98 A, respectively. The decreases in surface area and pore size were very small compared with the large promotion effect by tungsten. Hence, the maximal effect of activity promotion appeared at the 0.5 wt.% addition of tungsten. However, further increase in tungsten content decreased the pore sizes of the catalyst and increased the diffusional resistance of reactants, particularly asphaltenes, resulting in a decrease in the apparent reaction rate. 4. Conclusions In the hydrotreating of atmospheric residual oil catalyzed over CoMo/y-A1203, the conversions of heavy oil fractions and asphaltenes to light oil fractions were found to be correlated with HDS activity of the catalyst. Among the transition metals added to CoMo/y-A1203 catalyst, nickel and tungsten improved the performance of the catalyst, while ruthenium showed no effects. NiCoMo/ y-A1203 and WCoMo/y-A1203 showed higher activities and more improved maintenance in all hydrotreating reactions than did a commercial CoMo/y-A1203 catalyst, which was due mainly to the increase in the HDS catalytic activity. The addition of an amount of tungsten as low as 0.5 wt.-% to the CoMo/ y-A1203 catalyst brought considerable improvements in the hydrotreating performance of the catalyst. The use of tungsten as a secondary promoter of CoMo/y-A1203 catalyst is desirable in the high pressure hydrotreating of atmospheric residual oil.

Box 5, Taedok Science Town, Taejon 305-343, South Korea b Department of Chemical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taedok Science Town, Taejon 305-701, South Korea The effects of transition metal addition to a commercial CoMo/ γ-Al2O3 catalyst on the hydrotreatment of atmospheric residual oil were investigated using a continuous flow fixed bed reactor operated at 420°C and 6.9 MPa. Nickel, ruthenium and tungsten were used as an additive to the catalyst. Catalyst performances were evaluated in terms of activities and initial deactivation rates in sulfur removal, conversion of heavier to lighter oil fractions, and removal of asphaltenes. Among the metal additive-modified CoMo/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts, NiCoMo/ γ-Al2O3 and WCoMo/ γ-Al2O3 showed a more improved reaction performance than commercial CoMo/ γ-Al2O3 whereas RuCoMo/ γ-Al2O3, did not. The performance improvements observed after addition of nickel or tungsten were thought to be mainly a result of the promotion effect on the catalytic activity in hydrodesulfurization. Significant improvements of catalyst performance were obtained by the addition of a small amount of tungsten (0.5 wt.-%). Tungsten was considered to be promising as a secondary promoter of CoMo/ γ-Al2O3.
