PERRICHCN, i4I_ PMIET and P. BFJSSIERE Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 auenue .filbert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedes (France) Summary The hydrogenation of CO, has been studied at atmospheric pressure from 200 to 2 7 5 C on a Fe/A1203 catalyst and compared with CO hydrogenation. The catalytic results can be described by a three-step model= (1) fast loss of activity; (11) reactivation; and (111) filial deactivation. The selectivity towards Ci'-14 is very high at the beginning of step (1). The characterization of the catalyst during the reaction was effected by means of 1R and hlossbauer spectroscopies and magnetic measurements. The results show that only methane can be formed directly from CO,, while homologous hydrocarbons are formed from CO, itself derived from CO2. Two reaction paths for CO., - CO were shown to exist. Finally, it seems that time formate species, detected by IR during the reaction, plays an important role both in the regeneration of the catalytic activity and in CO formation by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Introduction The use of COz instead of CO as a source of carbon for the synthesis of valuable organic compounds is gaining renewed interest. Although it is necessary to supply more hydrogen to reduce C02, the hydrogenation of CO2 can be regarded as an interesting commercial process if it presents advantages in catalytic activity and selectivity. As pointed out recently [1] , in heterogeneous catalysis the use of CO2 in place of CO provides a more selective method of obtaining methanol or methane, with specific activities higher than with CO. Only a few experimental results are available with methanol catalysts [2, 3] . More results concern supported metal catalysts, particularly nickel [4- 71, ruthenium [8 - 101 and rhodium [11, 12), which are all very selective in methane. The results are different with iron catalysts1Jsually the H2+ CO2 reaction is not selective towards methane and the specific activities are equal or inferior to those obtained with E12 f CO [I3 - 151. However Dwyer and Somorjai [IBj have shown that HZ t C02 over iron foil yields almost exclusively CH4, and at a higher rate than does 0304-6102182/0000-0000/$02.75 9 Elsevier Secuoia/Printed in The Netherlands 368 the H, + CO reaction. Higher activity was also observed by Kiennemann et al. on an iron semi-coke catalyst [17] . There may exist different mechanisms at the origin of these opposite behaviours, and more results are needed on iron catalysts to answer this question. In a short note, we recently reported that the hydrogenation of C0Z On a Fe/ A1,03 catalyst exhibited important variations in selectivities and activity as a function of the reaction time [18] . Since these could explain the literature discrepancies, more detailed work has been performed. This paper presents the results concerning the catalytic properties during the reaction, with special attention -focused on the identification of surface species- For comparison, some results with H., ~- CO are also presented. Experimental Methods The catalytic test was performed in a dynamic differential reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. Reactants and products were analysed on line using TCD and FID chromatographs [ 19] . The catalyst was reduced in situ at 600 C under hydrogen (HSV = 5 000 h-`) and then cooled to the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture (CO, or CO:H, = 1) was introduced at a flow rate of HST = 1300 h-1, and the first analysis was performed five minutes after its introduction. The catalyst composition was followed during the reaction using Messbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements with a Faraday micrebalance [20] . The interaction of reactants with the solid and the reactivity of the species created were investigated by IR spectroscopy (Digilab FTS 14), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) or temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) with hydrogen, using respectively a microbalance or the dynamic reactor. N:a teria Is The catalyst sample is composed of iron (10% by weight) deposited en alumina (Degussa Oxyd C) by a precipitation method already described [ 2? ] . The dispersion of metallic iron measured by CO chemisorption is about 3 - 4% [ 22] . The BET area of the reduced solid is 100 m= r '. For comparson, a Fe/SiO, catalyst was prepared by impregnation of silica (Degussa Aerosil) with a solution of ferric nitrate. In order to obtain a dispersion close to that obtained with Fe/A1203, it was reduced at only 380 C according to the method of Blyholder [ 23] . The degree of reduction calculated from magnetic measurements was 75'0. Results Catalytic actiuity Figure 1 shows that, for temperatures between 200 and 275 C, the conversions of CO, into CO and hydrocarbons respectively vary similarly 369 a 1.2 \\_ a L \\ y e Qg r 0 / c Q6 v- 0 / - 0.4 O 5 0 1~ 20 O 5 02 t('&=___ - l0 15 20 lime (hours) Fig. I. Conversion of h02 to hydrocarbons (a) and to CO (b) at 200 C (0), 225 C (o), 250 C (e), and 275 C (s), as a function of reaction time- with the reaction time. However, this variation is different for each temperature. In particular, at the beginning of the reaction. a rapid decrease in activity is observed at 200 and 225 C, while the activity increases at 250 and 275 C. in contrast, with H2 + CO the conversions decrease uniformly with tire e [ ? a] . A comparison of the specific activities towards hydrocarbons for H., C02 and HZ + CO reactions ('Fable 1) after 20 h of synthesis shows that at any temperature the conversion rate of C02 is lower; this is also observed for shorter reaction times. Product distribution Carbon monoxide is the main product of the reaction. As can be seen in 'Fable 1, the selectivity for CO remains greater than 70% at any time and temperature. In this table are also given the values of K1 = Pco Pu,o/Pu.Pco., measured after 20 h of reaction. This is a measure of the reverse of the water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) which is known to be a side reaction in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The R%i7GS reaction becomes more important with temperature, without reaching thermodyna-mic equilibrium, as was observed at ? 5 bars with a prornoted iron. catalyst [14'..~. It must be noted that initiaill water vapour is detected only at 275 C. The hydrocarbon distributions (C1-C12) calculated on a carbon basis are presented in Fig. 2. The methane selectivity is initi-lly very high (the lower the temperature, the higher the selectivity) and decreases with time, manly during the first hours of the reaction. On the contrary, for H2 f CO the methane selectivity is enhanced by raising the temperature, but increase= slightly during the aging of the catalyst [181. Finally. the C2-C3 olefin percentage is much lower with H, + C02 than with H2 + CO (Table 1), as already observed [14, 171 .

This second picture seems the most probable, since all our results can be described by a model involving three successive steps. Step 1: As soon as the reaction mixture is introduced, the activity decreases. This deactivation is instantaneous above 250 C, but lakes 2 h at 200 C. This explains the decrease in conversions after 5 min while temperature increases. The initial products are CO arid CH . While deactivation occurs, the selectivity towards CO increases and the fraction of methane decreases. Step 2: Re-activation of tile catalyst is observed. This process is very slow at 200 C but needs only 2 h at 275 C. The activity goes through a maximum; during this period, there is a shirt of the selectivity from CO towards hydrocarbons (5 to 2a9'o) and the proportion of longer hydrocarbon chains increases. Step 3: A1 new de-activation process appears which can be observed only at 250 and 275 C. Kinetically less rapid than Step 1, it can be compared to a poisoning of the surface and is similar to that. observed in HZ + CO reaction. Tile hydrocarbon distribution remains nearly constant, however there is a slight increase in the CH,. fraction, as for E12 -'-- M This three-step model seems to describe all our results. Its validity s supported by the fact that tile selectivity values depend upon the reaction time and not on. temperature- 'File mechanistic involvements vsr=~1 be discussed in a later section. 372 Catalyst characterisation during the reaction Mossbauer spectra were accumulated at 250 C in the conditions of the reaction H2 + CO,. The evolution of the composition of the iron phases deduced from the resolution of the spectra shown in Fig. 3 follows that obtained in the H., CO reaction [21] . Table 2 gives the parameter values. There is a progressive transformation of the metallic iron into Fee +s C, identified from its two hyperfine field values [ 24, 25] , while the original unreduced Fee' phase (nearly 2090 of iron) remains unchanged. However, the rate of carbiding is lower with H2+ C02 than with H2 = CO. Particular, after 30 min reaction no carbide can be detected, and after 20 h 3090 of the iron is still present, while it is no longer detected using H2 + CO. No new bulk oxide phase has been detected. Figure 4 represents the changes at 250 C in the specific magnetization of iron during H2 + C02 and H2 + CO reactions (static conditions, P = 200 torr). The loss of magnetization is attributed to the formation of Feet _rC carbide identified by subsequent thermomagnetic analysis and from the Miissbauer experiments. It appears that the bulk carbiding occurs at a slower rate during H2 + C02, in agreement with the Mossbauer results. Temperature-programmed reduction of the used catalyst under HZ after 20 h of reaction reveals only one peak of methane (besides H=O peaks and other minor hydrocarbon products), which corresponds to the hydrogenation of the iron carbide. }Fez_c a r.s^^F b -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 +6 lie:ocily (mm /s) H2+CO I to Tune (hours) Fig. 3. l%ibssbauer spectra of Fe/A1i03 sample during Hz + C02 reaction at 250 C: (a) reduced, (b) from 3 h 15 tc 4 h 15 reaction time, and (c) from lg h 30 to 22 h 30 reaction time.

The spectra were recorded at room temperature (Fig. 5). Spectrum b (25 C) shows three bands at 1230, 1450 and 1650 crci-1. They were also formed on the support alone upon introduction of CO2, and are characteristic of hydrogenocarbonates [26]. A weaker CO band is observed at 1945 em', and must be attributed to Fe-CO species. It was also observed upon adsorption of CO on the same catalyst [27] , although a small shift is noted in the vibration frequency (1945 instead of 2005 cm 1) as previously observed in the case of ruthenium catalyst [9] . Although the band intensity is comparatively much lower than with CO, this result indicates that COZ can be dissociatively adsorbed on metallic iron according to the reaction: COZ ~ COa f Oa After heating the sample at 100 and 200 C, (spectra c and d), the carbonyl band at 1945 crn 1 vanished. The hydrogenoczrbonate bands also decreased, whereas new bands appeared at 1395 and 1595 cm '-, characteristic of formate species [28, 29] . After reaction at 250 C, only strong formate bands could be detected (spectrum d). When the same Fe/A1203 catalyst was heated under COZ instead of HZ ~ C02, the hydrogenocarbonate species remained on the support, and no formates were formed.

The major product was CO=, with two desorption maxima at 60 and 140 C. Above 320 C, no COZ vas observed. These peaks cap be attributed to the decomposition of the hydrogenoearbonate species, since we could observe their disappearance from the IR spectra between 150 and 200 C by heating under vacuum. On the supp srt alone, identical 1R results were obtained, suggesting that C0z adsorption mainly concerns the support, as in the case of Ru/Ai203 [ 3] . For CO dpsorption, a very weak peak was observed at 100 C, after correction for the fragmentation of the large COZ peak in the same tesoerature range. This corresponds to tile linear CO evidenced by IR spectroscopy. A much larger peak was observed between 300 and 500 C, which has been previously observed on the same catalyst after CO adsorption; and corresponds to a dissociated form of CO en the surface [27] . Thus it seems that C02 can dissociate on metallic iron is two forms, the totally dissociated form being the most favoured. 375 Discussion The catalytic results have shown an evolution of the 112 T CO. reaction with time which occurs in three step, the importance of which is a function of the reaction temperature. due will now consider the mechanisms which can be proposed after characterization of the contact mass. Step 1 We conclude from the preceding sections that C02 is easily dissociated on a clean iron surface, giving molecular and dissociated CO. At the beginning F)f the reaction, the catalyst shows a metallic iron surface, and C02 can undergo a series of reactions according to the equations: C02(g) V, C02(a) - (1) C02(a) :~*- O(z) i' C(a) + O(a) (2) C02(a) O(z) + CO(a) COW f- C(a) + 0(e) ( ) CO(a) :j CO(g) (5) where (g) or (a) represents the species in the gaseous or adsorbed state. It is difficult to state whether the total dissociation occurs in one step (flat adsorption - eqn. (2)) or in two successive steps (ecns. (3) and (4))_ At the reaction temperature, no carbonyl band could be observed, and it is probable that reactions (4) and (5) are very fast. This can explain the high production of CO at the beginning of the reaction. The RWGS can also explain CO formation. The water formed would be trapped on the support, which explains its absence in the reaction products, and would desorb at 250 C during the TFR. This idea is supported by the fact that at the beginning of the reaction, water is detected only at 275 C. However, if the R.ilGS occurs from the very beginning, it is difficult to understand why CO production goes through a minimum. It is therefore more likely that reaction (5) occurs very rapidly on iron and that RWGS occurs later (vide infra). Methane can be formed by hydrogenation of the surface carbon, according to general schemes [3ss - 32] . The high selectivity for methane can be explained either by an initial low concentration of the active carbon on the surface, or by a diluting effect of the two oxygen atoms created by dissociation, which prevents interaction between neighbour carbons [4, 33] , or both. The first situation must exist also irr the case of H2 j CO, and yet methane is not selectively produced. We conclude that oxygen is strongly chemtsorbed, which creates barriers between active carbons. The role of oxygen is also essential in understanding the decrease in activity- Indeed, the formation of CO or CH4 leads to a deposit of oxygen atoms or the sarface. If oxygen is continuously and quickly eliminated, the activity will remain statmnary. In the opposite case, oxygen will act 37s as a poison and the reaction will stop rapidly. This is indeed observed at 200 and 225 C and is what must happen very rapidly at 250 and 275 C. It implies that, under our conditions, hydrogen (which is the only reducing gas) is unable to reduce the oxidised iron. This hypothesis was verified by the foLowing experiments. After 1 h of H2 + C02 run at 225 C to deactivate the catalyst, H, was flushed through for 4 h at the same temperature before readmitting the reaction mixture. No re-activation occurred, and the activity started again at the minimum. (Fig. 7b). In contrast, if CO was added to the reactants, the activity level was nearly that of the maximum (Fig. 7a). These results are in good agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium: constants of the reduction of iron oxides [341 . Thus at the minimum of activity, the iron particles would ue superficially oxidised preventing further C02 dissociation. Effectively, the Mossbauer results show the absence of carbide after 30 min at 250 C under HZ + C02, while under H2 + CO, 5094 of the spectra is due to Fee ..C carbide. Magnetism results show a slower rate of carbiding under H2 + CO,. A1i these results are consistent with the proposed scheme where a barrier of oxygen makes impossible the dissociation of C02 or CO and the diffusion of carbon to form a bulk carbide. Step 2 When the activity reaches its minimum, 95% of the transformed C02 is constituted of CO. From re-activation experiments, it is difficult to understand why the CO formed from. the beginning is unable to prevent the deactivation, and then under nearly the same conditions can regenerate the activity. To explain the re-activation, it is necessary to assume another intermediate able to reduce the oxidised iron. The fact that water is produced in amounts higher than required for producing the hydrocarbons indicates that the RWGS occurs in this step 2. The CO produced in the gas phase has no more chance to reduce the surface than the initial CO produced by C02 dissociation. However, it is possible that intermediates which give the RWGS could also reduce the surface. Formate species have been proposed as intermediates for the RVTGS [30, 35] . In the IR study, such species were observed to develop during the reaction. Surface formate species were also evidenced by Solymesi et al. [9, 121 for ruthenium and rhodium catalysts, and the role of the metal in their formation was clearly shown. However, the role of formates in the hydrogenation of C02 remained ambiguous. From our results, we propose that formates can participate either in the RWGS reaction or in the elimination of an oxygen atom. giving a hydroxyl which ia further eliminated as water.

The participation of the formate species in the regeneration of the catalyst has been supported by an experiment performed with an ironsilica catalyst. Indeed, no formates are evidenced ore silica by IR spectroscopy [28, 36] . If they participate in the regeneration of the contact mass, such re-activation mast not occur at the end of step 1. Effectively, by reacting H., + C02 at 225 C on FeJSiOZ, after the initial de-activation (step L), no re-activation was observed, as illustrated in Fig. 7a, which emphasizes the effect of the support on the mechanisms which govern catalytic activity- As long as the surface is progressively regenerated, new sites are available for CO (arising from the RWOS) or COZ adsorption. One can think that CO needs fewer adjacent sites and will be preferentially adsorbed. The catalyst behaves more and more as in the HZ f CO reaction. However, even at maximum activity, the hydrocarbon conversion is much tower than with H2 j CO, probably because surface oxygens are not completely eliminated. In fact, if the hydrocarbon conversion is calculated with respect to the actual CO concentration in place of COz, the value is of the same order as that found in the H2 f CO reaction under equivalent conditions, indicating that COZ is no longer participating in the synthesis of hydrocarbons. 378 Step 3 If hydrogenation of CO occurs in place of that of COZ, step 3 will be characteristic of a Fischer-Tropsch test. Actually the hydrocarbon selectivity is nearly identical to that observed in the H, t CO reaction with a H,:CO ratio equal to the actual one in the H2 f COz reaction. An example is given in 'fable 3 for a test at 250 C. The good agre_ment between the two sets of values supports the latter hypothesis. Thus the causes of deactivation invoked in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis must be responsible for the ageing observed in Step 3, ie. the poisoning of the surface by a carbon not easily hydrogenable [ 37, 3E ] . It must be noted that the methane selectivity increases slightly during tae H, + COZ test at 275 C, which is exactly what is observed in the hydropr=nation of CO.

Four main conclusions can be drawn from our results: (i) The hydrogenation of CO, occurs according to three sv.ccessive steps which describe all the changes of activity and selectivity with time. The main reaction product is CO, which can be obtained two different ways: by partial dissociation of CO, and by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. (ii) The activity and selectivity are related to the absence or the presence of oxygen on the surface of iron. On clean iron, C02 is selectively transformed into methane. This selectivity car. be maintained only if oxygen elimination is not the rate-determining step. This condition seems to be realised in experiments of Dwyer and Somorjai with hydrogen pressure higher than 1 bar [16] . Under these conditions CO2 could be more advantageous than CO- (iii) The non-elimination of oxygen causes ageing of the catalyst. The change in selectivity which results corresponds to the hydrogenation of CO instead of CO,. (iv) The results emphasize the important role of the formate species, both in the regeneration of the catalytic activity and in the production of CO by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Thus, the effect of the support on the catalytic activity has been clearly shown. 379 Acknowledgements We g-ratefully acknowledge support for this research from C.N.R.S. (Greco `Oxydes de Carhone').

Bussiere Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cédex France The hydrogenation of CO2 has been studied at atmospheric pressure from 200 to 275°C on a Fe/Al2CO3 catalyst and compared with CO hydrogenation. The catalytic results can be described by a three-step model: (I) fast loss of activity; (II) reactivation; and (III) final deactivation. The selectivity towards CH4 is very high at the beginning of step (I). The characterization of the catalyst during the reaction was effected by means of IR and Mössbauer spectroscopies and magnetic measurements. The results show that only methane can be formed directly from CO2, while homologous hydrocarbons are formed from CO, itself derived from CO2. Two reaction paths for CO2 → CO were shown to exist. Finally, it seems that the formate species, detected by IR during the reaction, plays an important role both in the regeneration of the catalytic activity and in CO formation by the reverse water-gas shift reaction.
