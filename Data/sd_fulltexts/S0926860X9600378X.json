The performance of palladium black is comparable with that of palladium on activated carbon. Fresh and used samples are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Under reaction conditions, at temperatures as low as 423 K, palladium is converted into palladium carbide (PdCo.15). The amount of carbon on the catalytic surface is negligible. Fluorine present has no catalytic effect. Methane treatment (>523 K) and ethene treatment (>448 K) also lead to the formation of palladium carbide. In those cases carbon is deposited on the surface of the palladium. The amount of hydrogen in fresh palladium, determined by measuring the temperature of decomposition of palladium hydride at different partial pressures of hydrogen and by measuring the heat of decomposition in DSC, is as Pdno.6. This amount is in agreement with the value as obtained by TPR and as reported in literature.

Introduction It is generally accepted [1] that fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and that they contribute to the greenhouse effect.

In practice considerable amounts are still present (estimated [2] 2.25 Mton; ,.~45% CC12F2 and ~45% CC13F). The recovery of these substances and the subsequent destruction are a logical step to follow. Many destruction techniques have been proposed [2-7]. Obviously, the conversion of CFCs into valuable chemicals is a better option than destruction. In our group a catalytic process is under development for the conversion of CC12F2 (CFC-12) into CH2F2 (HFC-32), which can be used in refrigerant applications [8]: CC12F2 + 2H2 ~ CH2F2 + 2HC1 (1) Because CC13F can be converted with HF into CC12F2, ~90% of all the CFCs can be converted with this process. We have found [9-11] that palladium on activated carbon is a suitable catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 into CHzF2. This catalyst shows a selectivity of 70-90 mol%, at all conversion levels in a broad range of process conditions. The main by-products are CHC1F2 and methane. It was observed that the characterization of the active phase in this catalyst is very cumbersome due to its low loading (1 wt%). The application of palladium black as model catalyst suggests itself. In the palladium hydrogen system two face centered cubic phases, designated c~ and/3, with a low and high concentration of hydrogen, respectively, are reported [ 12]. In both cases hydrogen is located in the octahedral interstices. This palladium hydride phase can play a special role in catalysis [13]. The amount of hydrogen, which will be absorbed in the palladium crystal structure, is dependent both on temperature and hydrogen pressure. By the formation of/3-palladium hydride an expansion of the palladium unit cell occurs as found by XRD [14]. The amount of hydrogen can be determined by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) as done by Ziemecki et al. [14,15]. For the determination of the amount of hydrogen in palladium differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also can be applied, since the formation and decomposition of palladium hydride are processes associated with large heat effects. Because of the sharper transition the decomposition will be focussed upon. The reaction for the decomposition can be written as 2 PdHx ~ 2 Pd - + H2 (2) x x If thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed, the following relations are valid: AGo = -RT In K = -RT In p(H2), (3) In p(H2) - --A/-/-~ (4) RT R With palladium the interaction with carbon monoxide, ethene, and ethyne might lead to the formation of an interstitial solid solution of carbon in the metal (palladium carbide), which possesses the f.c.c, lattice with a slightly increased lattice constant over that of the pure metal [14,16] E.J.A.X. van de San& et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 59-73 61 The objective of this study is to get information from characterization of fresh and used palladium black, on the structure of the active phase during reaction conditions for carbon supported palladium catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2. 2. Experimental Palladium black (Aldrich) was used as a model catalyst. A Hastelloy-C fixed-bed micro-flow reactor was employed to conduct the hydrogenolysis experiments. The catalyst was treated in situ under hydrogen flow from ambient temperature up to reaction temperature and CFC feed was introduced. The performance of the catalyst was determined by an on-line gas chromatograph, equipped with a 75 m.53 mm Poraplot Q column and a thermal conductivity detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powdered catalyst were recorded on a Siemens D500 diffractometer with a Cu K~ radiation source. The Bragg relation was used to calculate the lattice distance. The average metal crystallite size was estimated with the Scherrer equation and Warren's correction for instrumental line broadening. Temperature programmed X-ray diffraction (TP-XRD) was recorded on a Guinier Lenn6 camera from Enraf-Nonius, using Cu Ks source. Samples were mortar-milled and deposited on a Pt grid. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 673 K at 0.0056 K/s. After the experiment, the Guinier photo was digitized and scans could be obtained at selected temperatures. TPR was measured on a home-made apparatus. Catalyst samples diluted with non-porous silicon carbide were heated at 0.167 K/s in a 5 vol% hydrogen in argon mixture. The hydrogen consumption/evolution was determined with a calibrated thermal con- ductivity detector. The impurities in palladium black were determined with a Philips PW1480 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. DSC with programmed heating was carded out on an apparatus from Polymer Laboratories, type PL-DSC (maximum temperature: 673 K). Calibration was done in situ by melting tin on the top of the sample [17]. Both hydrogen (TPR) and air (temperature programmed oxidation, TPO) were used in the DSC equipment. Samples were transferred in open air from H2/CC12F2 reaction conditions to the characterization equipment after fast cooling under a helium atmosphere from reaction temperature to ambient temperature. 3. Results 3.1. Performance of palladium black The performance of palladium black in the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 as a function of temperature is depicted in Fig. 1.

Reaction conditions: WHSV=4 g/(g h), H2/CC12F2=3, p=0.3 MPa. a selectivity of 70% to CH2F2 can be achieved. At higher temperature the conversion of CC12F2 is strongly increasing, while the selectivity to CH2F2 is decreasing and the formation of methane is increasing. This behavior is qualita- tively in agreement with the 1 wt% palladium on activated carbon catalyst. However, the latter catalyst shows a lower decrease in selectivity to CH2F2 (from 85-75%) [9,10]. Minor products observed are CHaF, CH3C1, CH2C1F, CH2C12, ethane, and propane. At all reaction conditions applied, no formation of CHF3 was found. As a function of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), a similar behavior in performance was observed: an increasing conversion with decreasing WHSV and a rather constant selectivity to all main and side products. 3.2. Characterization 3.2.1. XRF According to XRF the purchased palladium black consists of 99.74 wt% of palladium. The main impurities are 250 ppm iron, 720 ppm rhodium, and 290 ppm platinum. 3.2.2. XRD The XRD-pattems of fresh and used palladium black are given in Fig. 2. The lattice constant calculated from the (1 1 1) plane of the fresh palladium black is 0.3890 nm, which corresponds well with 0.38898 nm, as reported in the PDF cards [18]. The average particle diameter is 9.9 nm. From the small peak at 33.8(curve (a) in Fig. 2), it is clear that some palladium oxide is present [18]. For the used palladium black the lattice constant is 0.3996 nm and the average crystallite size is 40.9 nm. Clearly during the reaction sintering of palladium takes place and moreover a transition to another phase occurs. The lattice constant is close to that of palladium hydride (0.402 nm) [18]. This hydride phase is, however, unstable at room temperature in the absence of hydrogen [14].

[14,16,19-26] it can be concluded that the new phase is a solid solution of palladium and carbon, PdC0.15. 3.2.3. Temperature programmed techniques 3.2.3.1. Hydrogen content in fresh palladium black. The absorption and desorption of hydrogen by fresh palladium black at different partial pressures of hydrogen as measured with DSC is shown in Fig. 3. For the 12.2 vol% H2/N2 gas stream (curve (a)), during the heating period an endothermic effect is found with an onset temperature of 338 K, which can be explained by the decomposition of palladium hydride. When cooling down, the formation of the palladium hydride starts at 322 K and an exothermic effect is observed. A hysteresis effect is found, which is described by several authors [27,28]. At higher partial pressures of hydrogen the decomposition temperature of palladium hydride increases.

Plot of In[partial hydrogen pressure] versus reciprocal temperature for the decomposition of palladium hydride. hydrogen supply at 298 K is 93 J/g Pd, which is in good agreement with the reported value of 92 J/g Pd [29]. The logarithm of the partial pressure of hydrogen versus the reciprocal onset temperature of decomposition of palladium hydride is plotted in Fig. 4. Assuming equilibrium from the slope the heat of reaction is calculated as 31 kJ/mol H2 (see Eq. (4)). The H/Pd atomic ratio is 0.64. The hydrogen content was also measured by TPR by increasing the temperature from room temperature at 0.167 K/s in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar. The release of hydrogen corresponds with a H/Pd ratio of 0.60. The used palladium black was also examined in DSC using 10 vol% H2/N2. In contrast with the fresh palladium black (Fig. 3) no peaks were observed. 3.2.3.2. TPR. The TPR results of the used sample are depicted in Fig. 5. The curve for the first TPR (curve (a)) shows a broad consumption of hydrogen, whereas the second TPR (curve (b)) shows a sharp release of hydrogen. The latter one is identical to the TPR curve of fresh palladium black. Reduction of palladium oxide or palladium chloride cannot play a role in the interpretation of these curves, because these compounds already reduce at room temperature [30]. The consumption of hydrogen is, therefore, explained by either conversion of palladium carbide into palladium and methane or the gasification of carbonaceous deposits into for example CH4. Quantification of the curves gives for the first TPR profile a H/Pd of 0.60 (corresponds to C/Pd=0.15) and for the second TPR a H/Pd of 0.57. 3.2.4. Comparison with other methods for preparation of palladium carbide characterized by TPO In literature it is reported that palladium carbide can be prepared by having palladium in contact with ethene, ethyne, and carbon monoxide [14,16]. We have found that it is also possible to form the carbide phase with methane and with CC12F2/H2.

In Fig. 6 XRD profiles are depicted for palladium treated with CC12F2/ H2, ethene, and methane at different temperatures. In all cases the transition of palladium (20~40.2) into palladium carbide (20~39.0) has been observed. It can been seen that upon treatment of palladium with the CClzFz/H2 mixture at 423 K for 2 h minor parts of the palladium phase remains (curve (b) in Fig. 6). At 473 K palladium is completely converted into palladium carbide (curve (c) in Fig. 6). Also it was found that hydrogen is needed for the formation of palladium carbide. Up to 573 K applying only CClzF2 no carbide formation was observed. The i 1000 cp~ ~ f ~ e ./X._ b , ~ 35 40 45 50 diffraction angle (2 e) Fig. 6.

With methane higher tempera- tures are required (curves (d)-(f)). The formation of palladium carbide with methane has not reported elsewhere to the best of our knowledge. The palladium carbide samples, prepared from CC12F2/I-I2, ethene, and methane, were examined by TPO in DSC. Typical results are shown in Fig. 7. The patterns of the palladium carbide samples, prepared with CC12F2 and hydrogen, were identical in all cases. This was also the case when the sample was treated at higher temperatures (up to 573 K for 2 h) and for longer periods of time (up to 80 h at 500 K). For the palladium carbide prepared from methane or ethene, different patterns were found, as can be seen in Fig. 7. The C/Pd ratio, determined from the heat of formation of carbon dioxide, is calculated as 0.14, 0.41, and 0.53 for curves (b), (c), and (d), respectively. The ratio for the palladium carbide phase prepared from the CC12F2/I-I2 mixture corresponds with the value of 0.15 as determined with TPR (Fig. 5). In all experiments performed with CC12F2 and H2, the C/Pd ratio was 0.14--0.16. 3.2.5. Stability of palladium carbide phase TP-XRD experiments, in which hydrogen, air, or nitrogen are flushed through the X-ray chamber, were carried out to study the stability of the palladium carbide phase, prepared from CC12F2 and H2 at 523 K for 2 h. Fig. 8 illustrates the decomposition of the palladium carbide phase in hydrogen. It can be seen that the decomposition starts at temperatures above 523 K and is complete at 583 K. After the experiment the sample was cooled to room temperature and a shift to lower angles was observed. This is due to the formation of ~3-palladium hydride, which disappears when the hydrogen supply is turned off. The stability of palladium carbide under air and inert (nitrogen) is shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively.

At temperatures above 533 K a peak at 33.8appears due to the formation of palladium oxide. For the treatment under nitrogen some decomposition is observed which is, however, not complete at 673 K for the investigated time period. 4. Discussion 4.1. Performance of palladium black during hydrogenolysis of CCI2Fe Under reaction conditions, at low conversion of CC12F2, the performance of palladium black is comparable with that of 1 wt% palladium on activated carbon as reported before [9,10]. At higher conversion over palladium black more methane is formed than over 1 wt% Pd/C. However, the performance is in agreement with catalysts with higher palladium loading which also show more methane formation at higher temperatures. Over palladium black no formation of CHF3 is found, whereas this compound was found on the supported catalysts. It is concluded in our earlier papers [9,10] that CHF3 is formed by chlorine~fluorine exchange reactions, catalyzed by impurities in the activated carbon. The present observation supports the explanation given. Although the presence of fluorine on used palladium black was measured, the observed selectivities show that fluorine present on the E.J.A.X. van de Sandtet al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 59-73 69 palladium surface has no catalytic effect [31]. It is important to take this into account when a mechanism for the reaction is postulated [32]. 4.2. Characterization of fresh and used palladium black 4.2.1. XRD From XRD it can be seen that, during hydrogenolysis of CC12F2, palladium is converted to palladium carbide (PdCo.15). Due to the incorporation of carbon an expansion of the palladium lattice occurs which results in a shift to lower angle. A larger shift means that more carbon is present in the octahedral holes. C/Pd atomic molar ratios up to a maximum of 0.15 are possible [ 14,16,19-26], indicating that more carbon cannot enter the octahedral holes in the palladium carbide formed during the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2. This transformation was also found for carbon supported palladium catalysts [10]. Coq et al. [33] also found an expansion of 3% of the interplanar planes after hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 over palladium black and palladium/graphite but they suggested that a diffusion of chlorine and fluorine in the bulk of the palladium was responsible for this expansion. However, based on the literature [ 14,16,19-26] and the results of this study, the formation of palladium carbide is a more plausible explanation. 4.2.2. Temperature programmed techniques 4.2.2.1. Hydrogen content in fresh palladium black. The heat of decomposition of palladium hydride as measured with DSC (93 J/g Pd) is in agreement with the reported data of 92 J/g Pd [29]. The amount of hydrogen in palladium hydride as determined with DSC and TPR, is calculated to be 0.64 and 0.60, respectively. These values are in agreement with those reported in literature [12,14]. For DSC measurements a few remarks have to be made. The amount of hydrogen present in palladium hydride is dependent on both the partial pressure and temperature. The method applied by measuring the temperature of decomposition of palladium hydride at different partial pressures suggests that different amounts of hydrogen are present in palladium. In the calculations thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed. Because a heating rate of 0.167 K/s was used, this is debatable. The value obtained, however, is in good agreement with the data of the other techniques applied and, as a consequence, it is concluded that in DSC thermodynamic equilibrium existed. 4.2.2.2. TPR and TPO of used catalyst. The TPR results support the formation of palladium carbide as found by XRD. The curve for the second TPR experiment (curve (b) in Fig. 5) is similar to the curve for the fresh palladium black. Here, a release of hydrogen is found due to decomposition of palladium hydride. The first TPR (curve (a) in Fig. 5) of the used sample gives no release, but a consumption of hydrogen. This can be explained by the formation of palladium carbide. The 70 E.J.A.X. van de Sandt et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 59-73 octahedral holes are occupied and no palladium hydride can be formed. The consumption of hydrogen is a result of the conversion of palladium carbide into palladium and probably methane (as found by Maciejeskwi et al. [19]). The measurements show that the formation of palladium carbide and palladium hydride are reversible. DSC experiments for the used catalyst applying 10 vol% H2/N2 gave no peaks, showing that neither palladium hydride was formed nor decomposition into palladium and hydrogen occurred. Presumably the temperature of 673 K (max- imum allowable temperature for the DSC apparatus) is not high enough for the complete conversion and/or the sensitivity of the DSC was too low. When applying air (TPO), however, a combustion peak was found, from which a C/Pd ratio of 0.14 could be calculated. This corresponds with the C/Pd ratio of 0.15 as obtained by TPR. 4.3. Comparison with other methods for preparation of palladium carbide Various methods for the conversion of palladium into palladium carbide are reported and summarized by Ziemecki et al. [16]. Depending on the method applied, the surface of palladium can remain clean and carbon will only be present in the octahedral holes. This behavior was found, for instance, during carbon deposition from carbon monoxide. At temperatures between 370 K and 540 K the amount of carbon deposited on the surface is negligible, but at higher temperatures it became more significant [ 19]. Different types of deposited carbon from methane were reported by Solymosi et al. [34,35], but they did not report the formation of palladium carbide. In this study it was observed that when applying methane and ethene the C/Pd ratio (as obtained by TPO in DSC) is much higher (C/Pd is 0.41 and 0.53, respectively) than the amount of carbon that can be present in the octahedral holes (C/Pd=0.14). Therefore, it is concluded that part of the carbon is present as coke deposits on the outer surface of palladium. In those cases more than one combustion peak is observed, confirming the presence of different types of carbon on palladium black. In the case of CC12F2 and H2, C/Pd is 0.14. This indicates that only carbon is present in the octahedral holes of palladium and that the amount on the outer surface is negligible. 4.4. Stability of palladium carbide phase Ziemecki et al. [16] observed the decomposition of palladium carbide at 873 K in an inert atmosphere and at 423 K in H2 or air, while Stachurski [26] observed decomposition at 610 K in an Ar atmosphere or under vacuum, and at 460 K in H2. Maciejewski and Baiker [ 19] found decomposition with air at temperatures as low as 350 K and with hydrogen from 400 K. In the present study the decomposition under hydrogen, oxygen, and inert atmospheres starts at 523 K, 393 K, and 623 K, E.J.A.X. van de Sandt et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 59-73 71 respectively. From the different values of decomposition it can be concluded that those values are dependent on the preparation method applied. It is necessary to keep in mind that artifacts can be found due to heat and mass transport limitations, especially in reactions with large reaction enthalpies, as found by Neeft et al. [36]. Also the heating rate applied can have an influence on the decom- position temperature observed. It is, however, encouraging that although the carbon source, temperature, and time of reaction may play a role, in general the data agree well. 4.5. Palladium under reaction conditions In practice the catalyst will be operated at temperatures around 510 K and at H2/CC12F2 ratios between 10 and 15 [37]. Under reaction conditions the formation of /3-palladium hydride is not possible because on the one hand, this phase decomposes under those conditions and on the other, the conversion of palladium into palladium carbide is already complete at 423 K after 2 h. The decomposition of this palladium carbide phase under H2 (without CC12F2) starts above 523 K. Therefore, we conclude that the palladium phase, during the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 into CH2F2 over palladium, is present as palladium carbide. Based on the TPR- and TPO-measurements the palladium carbide from the CC12F2/H2 mixture has a negligible amount of carbon on the catalytic surface under the conditions applied. During the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 no CHF3 was observed, indicating that although fluorine is present on the catalytic surface, it has no catalytic effect. 5. Conclusions Palladium black as the model catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of CC12F2 is found to be very useful. The performance is qualitatively in agreement with palladium on activated carbon. From XRD, TPR, TPO, and DSC it is concluded that during reaction conditions palladium is converted into palladium carbide and that the C/Pd ratio is ~0.15. This indicates that the carbon deposited on the outer surface is negligible. Fluorine present on the catalytic surface has no catalytic effect. The amount of hydrogen in fresh palladium, determined by measuring the temperature of decomposition of palladium hydride at different partial pressures of hydrogen and by measuring the heat of decomposition in DSC, is PdHo.6. This is in agreement with the value obtained by TPR and with the literature data. We found that besides treatment with CC12F2/I-I2, the conversion of palladium into palladium carbide also proceeds upon treatment with ethene (as reported in literature) and methane. In those cases carbonaceous species are present on the outer surface of palladium. Temperature programmed X-ray diffraction is an useful technique for in situ studying the catalytic phase of catalysts. The decomposition of palladium carbide 72 E.J.A.X. van de Sandt et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 59-73 under hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen starts at 523 K, 393 K, and 623 K, respec- tively.

Fax: +31 15 2784452. Palladium black is applied as a model catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of CCl2F2 into CH2F2 over carbon supported palladium. The performance of palladium black is comparable with that of palladium on activated carbon. Fresh and used samples are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Under reaction conditions, at temperatures as low as 423 K, palladium is converted into palladium carbide (PdC0.15). The amount of carbon on the catalytic surface is negligible. Fluorine present has no catalytic effect. Methane treatment (523 K) and ethene reatment (448 K) also lead to the formation of palladium carbide. In those cases carbon is deposited on the surface of the palladium. The amount of hydrogen in fresh palladium, determined by measuring the temperature of decomposition of palladium hydride at different partial pressures of hydrogen and by measuring the heat of decomposition in DSC, is as PdH0.6. This amount is in agreement with the value as obtained by TPR and as reported in literature.
