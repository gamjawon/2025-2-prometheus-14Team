Graphical abstract The surface properties of catalyst supports are important in regulating the catalytic properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we studied the effect of acid-base properties of alumina on metal-support interaction and coke deposition, and investigated the stability of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using PtSn/Al2O3. We prepared γ-Al2O3 (A750) from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) and compared it with a commercial sample (Sasol Puralox SBA-200; P200). We loaded 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn on alumina then conducted propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C (WHSV = 5.2 h−1). PtSn/A750 and PtSn/P200 showed compatible initial activity (conversion = ˜50%) and selectivity (> 95%). After 20 h of reaction, PtSn/A750 showed a slight decrease in activity (39.9%) while the activity of PtSn/P200 dropped significantly (28.4%). Spent catalysts showed different metal sintering behavior and coke deposition which are well known causes for catalyst deactivation. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in A750 (higher Td in ethanol TPD) prevented the sintering of metal by strong metal-support interaction. Also, the lower number of Lewis acid sites in A750 than that of P200 reduced deposited coke on the catalysts (PtSn/A750: 1.8 wt% and PtSn/P200: 8.6 wt%). Furthermore, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 °C clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at these sites. These results suggested that strong metal-support interactions to hold metal particles and less residual Lewis acid sites after metal loading to reduce coke deposition are important factors for designing stable and coke-resistant PtSn on alumina catalysts. Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability. Keywords Gamma alumina Alumina surface properties Stability Sintering Coke behavior Propane Dehydrogenation 1 Introduction Recently, the demand for light olefins including propylene has increased because of their applications as raw materials in polypropylene, propylene oxide, oxo-alcohol, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid in petrochemicals [1–12]. In general, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of oil supply light olefins. However, these processes are insufficient for meeting the growing demand for propylene because of their high energy consumptions and low selectivity. Hence, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained attention for propylene production by utilizing propane gas. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in the PDH industrial field due to their excellent activity and thermal stability. However, PDH, which affords high yields of propylene, is an endothermic reaction. It requires high reaction temperatures causing severe catalyst deactivation by metal sintering and coke deposition formed through undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, and aromatization of light alkanes. To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the electronic properties of Pt particles [13–16]. Moreover, alkali (Li, Na, K), alkali earth (Mg, Ca), and rare earth (La, Ce) metals were employed to modify the properties of the support [17–26]. For instance, Yu et al. reported that the addition of Ce to PtSn on alumina catalysts improved its stability by promoting strong metal-support interactions [23]. Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal surface to support surfaces [1,8,13,14]. However, a fundamental understanding of the acid-base properties of Al2O3 for improving catalytic reactivity in alumina-based PDH catalysts has been yet to be developed. By extension, the role of the support has been considered important as much as the supported metal, and so, various supports have been synthesized and used in PDH reaction to obtain high stability [3–6,27,28]. Recently, Shi et al. reported a novel nanosheet alumina for PDH, resulting in a highly stable catalyst. The improved stability of the catalysts were attributed to large amounts of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites (Alp) observed from 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) studies which are known for Pt anchoring sites [6,44]. However, there was a lack of explanation of the location of abundant Alp sites and acid-base properties of the alumina surface. Here, to clarify the effect of the acid-base properties of alumina on catalyst stability, we synthesized high-surface area γ-Al2O3 derived from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH). The synthesized γ-Al2O3 exhibited significantly different surface properties (stronger and less amounts of Lewis acid sites) from commercial γ-Al2O3, despite both having the same bulk properties. PDH was conducted after loading Pt-Sn on these two different γ-Al2O3. The catalytic stability of PtSn/Al2O3 derived from AACH was improved by suppressing sintering of the PtSn alloy particles and coke accumulation. Moreover, we provided the direct evidence of the relation between Lewis acid sites and coke behavior and investigated the locations of abundant Alp sites. We intended to contribute to improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts by characterizing and controlling the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces. 2 Experimental section 2.1 AACH synthesis Fibrous AACH was synthesized following a slightly modified procedure from the previous study [29]. AACH precursor was first prepared. Al(NO3)3·9H2O and urea ((NH2)2CO3) in 1:9 M ratio were dissolved in distilled water (100 mL) with 0.17 M Al3+. The mixture was transferred to a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 100 °C in an oven for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resultant white precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol several times, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. To obtain γ-Al2O3, the as-prepared AACH powders were calcined at different temperatures (600 °C and 750 °C) for 5 h. The final powder products were labeled A600 and A750, respectively. 2.2 Catalyst preparation PtSn/Al2O3 was synthesized by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method with optimum amounts of 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn. Accordingly, the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O were dissolved in ethanol. The metal precursor was then impregnated in Al2O3 three times to obtain a homogenized metal loading. The catalysts were dried for 12 h in an electrical oven at 60 °C, followed by calcination in 20% O2/He (total 100 sccm) at 500 °C for 4 h, and then reduced in 10% H2/He (total 60 sccm) at 590 °C for 2 h. Puralox SBA-200 (Sasol, γ-Al2O3) was used as reference alumina in this study. The synthesized catalysts were labeled as PtSn/A600, PtSn/A750, and PtSn/P200, correspondingly. 2.3 Characterization XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 instrument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) and step size of 0.02°/s, operated at 40 kV and 20 mA. The specific surface area was determined by measuring the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at −196 °C using ASAP 2420. Pore size distributions were determined by using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The morphology of the synthesized alumina was examined with an S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi, Japan) at 10 kV. Solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR experiments were performed at room temperature on a Varian VNMRS 600 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 14.4 T. The corresponding 27Al Larmor frequency was 156.3 MHz. All spectra were acquired using a 1.6-mm pencil-type MAS probe at spinning rate 25 kHz. Each spectrum was obtained from 512 scans with recycle delay time of 2 s. All spectra were externally referenced (i.e., the 0 ppm position) to the NMR peak of 1 M Al(NO3)3 aqueous solution. Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments for the characterization of alumina surfaces were performed following a similar procedure as that found in our previous reports (Supporting Information) [30,31]. The size distribution of Pt particulates on Pt/Al2O3 (fresh and reacted) was confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging using a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope operated at 200 kV. H2/O2 titration was performed using a Belcat-B with thermal conductivity detector (Supporting Information). Raman spectra to detect coke species were obtained at room temperature under ambient conditions using a confocal Raman spectrophotometer (Alpha 300, WITec) with 532 nm laser and objective lens (50 × ). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments for exhausted PtSn catalysts were conducted in a fixed bed reactor by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Agilent 7820 A) directly connected to flame ionization detector (Supporting Information). 2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation Propane dehydrogenation tests were performed at atmospheric pressure and 590 °C in a quartz flow reactor using 50 mg of sample. Prior to tests, the samples were reduced in situ under 10% H2/He (1.0 mL/s) flow at 590 °C for 2 h and then purged with He for 10 min to minimize the effects of the remaining H2. Afterward, a PDH reaction mixture of C3H8:H2:He = 1:1.25:4 (volume ratio) was fed to the reactor. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 5.2 h−1. The outlet gases were analyzed by a GC (Agilent 7820 A) using Al2O3-S column and FID (see detailed calculations and reaction condition tests in the Supporting Information). 3 Results and discussion This work aims to understand the effect of alumina surface characteristics on PDH. Therefore, two γ-Al2O3 samples, one commercially purchased (Puralox SBA 200; P200) and the other synthesized from AACH (ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide), were investigated. Figs. 1 (a) and S1(a) display the XRD patterns of alumina, confirming that the as-prepared samples contained the AACH phase (NH4AlCO3(OH)2, JCPDS no. 42-250). After heat treatment at 600 °C, the γ-Al2O3 phase appeared in A600 (2θ = 46° and 47°). AACH was completely converted to γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS no. 10-425) at 750 °C, which had the same structure as commercial γ-Al2O3 (P200). SEM images revealed that the as-prepared AACH exhibited fibrous morphology, which persisted through thermal treatment at 600 °C and 750 °C, as shown in Fig. S2. The surface areas of A600, A750, and P200 were comparable to each other (Table 1 ) and all alumina had very little micropores (N2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions are in Fig. S3). Solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR experiments and ethanol TPD were performed to characterize the prepared alumina. Fig. 1(b) shows the data of solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR experiments, which provided the relative ratio of various Al3+ sites in bulk alumina. Interestingly, A600 contained numerous penta-coordinated Al3+ sites (Alp) (approximately 32 at% which was calculated from solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR data), similar to the alumina obtained by Shi. et al.6 However, after complete conversion of AACH to γ-Al2O3 at 750 °C, A750 displayed similar levels of Alp sites and ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sites (1:2) as P200, indicating their identical bulk structures. Recently, we reported that ethanol TPD was highly effective for characterizing acidic sites on the alumina surface [30–33]. Fig. 1(c) displays the ethanol desorption profiles and Table 1 summarizes the temperature of the maximum desorption rate (Td) and the corresponding desorption amounts. Td values were different in P200, A750, and A600 at 220.8, 262, and 293 °C, respectively. Remarkably, even though P200 and A750 showed the same bulk structures as confirmed by XRD and solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR they presented significantly different ethanol desorption profiles, especially based on acid-base properties. Here, a higher value of Td means that the newly produced Lewis acid sites on alumina after dehydroxylation during pretreatment are unstable. So, those unstable sites hold dissociatively adsorbed ethanol strongly [37]. Additionally, the amounts of dissociatively adsorbed ethanol were 1.13, 1.04, and 1.48 site/nm2 in A600, A750, and P200 (Table 1), respectively. This indicates that the number of acid sites were significantly smaller in A600 and A750 than that in P200. Evidently, the surface properties (the number and strength of acid sites) of the different types of γ-Al2O3 were different despite their identical bulk structures. Then, we prepared PtSn-loaded catalysts for A750 and P200 to investigate the influences of different surface properties on PDH. To determine the optimal Pt:Sn ratio, we performed PDH tests using the synthesized catalysts with various levels of Sn and the Pt content fixed at 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. S5). The combination of 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn (Sn/Pt = 3.0) loaded on γ-Al2O3 showed the highest activity, selectivity, and stability while 0.1 wt% Sn (Sn/Pt = 0.3) showed the highest activity for silica supported samples (Fig. S4). These results implied that a considerable amount of Sn was used to modify the alumina surface, consistent with the results of other studies that reported the main alloy phase of PtSn on alumina surface was Pt3Sn [12,34–36]. STEM images of the fresh PtSn catalysts in Figs. 2 (a–c) illustrate that the metal particulates were highly dispersed in the alumina supports. The mean size of these Pt-Sn particles was measured to be about 1 nm from 200 metal particles (Figs. 2(d–f)). H2/O2 titration experiments were conducted for dispersion measurement of PtSn/Al2O3, with the results summarized in Table 2 [4]. Despite slightly lower dispersion in PtSn on P200 (H/Pt = 0.78), all catalysts showed good dispersion in accordance with the size of the metal particles measured from STEM. PDH was performed at 590 °C for 20 h with WHSV = 5.2 h−1 (detailed protocols of the reaction are in SI). Figs. 3 (a) and (b) reveal the conversion and selectivity profiles of PtSn on alumina as functions of reaction time. The initial conversions were comparable among the PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (48.5% in PtSn/A600, 48.3% in PtSn/A750, and 46.6% in PtSn/P200) owing to similar PtSn metal dispersion and properties, as discussed in SI 5. However, notably, different stabilities were displayed depending on alumina support. Catalyst deactivations were barely observed in PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750. Their conversions were 42.5 and 39.9%, respectively, after 20 h of PDH reaction. However, the PtSn/P200 catalyst experienced a dramatic decline in conversion during the first 3 h. Thereafter, its reactivity gradually decreased, resulting in 28.4% conversion after 20 h. The propylene selectivity, shown in Fig. 3(b), suggested no remarkable change to any of the catalysts. The selectivity of PtSn/P200 catalyst started at 94.2% for the first 3 h and stabilized at 96% thereafter; those of PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750 remained at 96.9 and 97.1%, respectively, for the entire reaction. To evaluate the deactivation profiles quantitatively, we calculated the first-order deactivation values (details are described in SI) of kd to be 0.011 h−1(PtSn/A600), 0.017 h−1(PtSn/A750), and 0.041 h−1(PtSn/P200). Also, PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750 showed higher stabilities than PtSn/P200 during repeated regeneration cycles, as shown in Fig. S10. Recently, Shi et al. reported alumina nanosheets with plenty of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites that showed superior activity, selectivity, and stability on the PDH reaction [6]. In our study, A600 displayed similar bulk structure and PtSn/A600 showed comparable reactivity profile to their alumina. However, it is noteworthy that PtSn/A750 showed equally outstanding activity and stability as PtSn/A600, although A750 had less penta-coordinated Al3+ sites than A600 and the same bulk structure as P200. There are two main causes of catalyst deactivation during the PDH reaction: the aggregation of metal particles and coke deposition during the reaction. We verified the sintering of PtSn metal particles by HAADF STEM and H2/O2 titration for the spent catalysts. Observably, PtSn metal particles had similar sizes on A600 and A750 supports even after 20 h reaction at 590 °C, as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) (low magnification STEM images are in Fig. S8). The mean sizes of the reacted PtSn particulates of A600 and A750 from TEM (1.1 ± 0.4 nm and 1.0 ± 0.2 nm, respectively) were comparable with those of the freshly prepared catalysts (1.1 ± 0.3 nm and 1.0 ± 0.3 nm, respectively), as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e). However, the spent PtSn/P200 showed large sintered PtSn clusters with a maximum size of ˜10 nm and broad size distribution with a mean size of 1.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (f). These results revealed that PtSn on A600 and A750 showed better sinter-resistances due to stronger interactions with alumina than that of P200. This could be explained with the ethanol TPD results. As discussed in Fig. 1(c), the unstable Lewis acid sites produced in A600 and A750 could be stabilized by PtSn metal particles, showing strong metal-support interaction during PDH [37]. H2/O2 titration experiments were performed on the spent samples to measure the dispersion of metal particulates, as shown in Table 2. The metal dispersion of PtSn/P200 was considerably decreased to H/Pt = 0.5 after the reaction, which was consistent with the TEM images. Considering the stability of the catalysts, PtSn/A750 showed a distinctively different profile for metal sintering than PtSn/P200, despite their identical bulk structures, which originated from strong interaction with the alumina surface. To investigate coke deposition during PDH, we characterized the amounts and species of coke on the spent catalysts by TPO with the results being shown in Fig. 5 and Table S1. PtSn/A600 (0.6 wt%) and PtSn/A750 (1.8 wt%) showed significantly lower amounts of deposited coke than PtSn/P200 (8.6 wt%). Interestingly, the coke content of PtSn/P200 was about five times that of PtSn/A750, despite their same bulk structures. Therefore, we attributed part of the relatively fast deactivation on PtSn/P200 to coke deposition, which was influenced by the alumina surface properties. For PtSn/A600 and PtSn/A750 samples, no significant aggregation of metal particulates was observed during the reaction, indicating that catalyst deactivation was mainly due to coke deposition. We observed deposited cokes at varying reaction times and investigated their correlation with specific acid sites on alumina. PtSn/A750 samples were subjected to PDH and collected after 3 min, 10 min, 1 h, and 2 h for systematic understanding of coke deposition on the alumina-based catalyst. Fig. 6 (a) presents TPO profiles of PtSn/A750 at different reaction times, confirming that the amount of coke increased with reaction time. We confirmed that the properties of PtSn clusters on A750 did not change significantly during the reaction, as shown in Fig. S11. This suggests that the coke precursor is easily desorbed from PtSn metal and favors to be deposited on alumina support rather than the metal active sites [2]. We performed DRIFTS experiments after CO adsorption at −150 °C to investigate the interaction of coke with the alumina surface. Fig. 6(b) displays the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on spent PtSn/A750 samples with varying reaction times (detailed peak assignments are listed in Table S2). Interestingly, the CO adsorbed on Lewis acid sites of A750 corresponding to 2194–2186 cm−1 disappeared immediately after the first 3 min of reaction then gradually increased as the reaction progressed. This suggests that coke deposition was initiated at the Lewis acid sites of A750. However, the Lewis acid sites reappeared as the reaction progressed. We hypothesized that the Lewis acid sites were affected by the transformation of coke species with increase in coke deposition. Fig. 6(c) displays the Raman spectra of spent PtSn/A750 samples with various reaction times to identify the coke species (detailed peak assignments are described in Table S3). Observably, the intensity of band between 2300–3300 cm−1 decreased with increasing reaction time, as shown in Fig. 6(c) (each spectrum was normalized to the band at 1598 cm−1). This indicates that aliphatic hydrocarbon content decreased and the coke species gradually transformed to aromatic hydrocarbons. To summarize DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy results (Fig. 6(b) and (c)), the coke precursors (aliphatic alkyl hydrocarbons) were initially induced at Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface and gradually were transformed to aromatic compounds. This follows the same mechanism as that reported for internal defects of zeolite that initially induced coke deposition [38–40]. However, it was interesting that the Lewis acid sites increased with the transformation of deposited coke species that simultaneously affected the adsorption of CO molecules at those sites, which needs to be further investigated [41–45]. Overall, we clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface. According to previous studies, coke precursor is initially formed at the Pt metal surface and then transferred to the support surface [44,45]. However, the DRIFT study demonstrated the absence of metal sintering and that the PtSn cluster surface remained unchanged significantly by coke deposition due to the effects of Sn addition. To understand why the amount of deposited coke on PtSn/P200 was five times higher than that on PtSn/A750, we performed alumina surface analysis. Fig. 6(d) provides the spectra from DRIFTS experiments after CO adsorption at −150 °C. Interestingly, the relative ratios of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were significantly reduced in A600 and A750 compared to that in P200. This was consistent result with the spectra of pyridine adsorption which is widely used for characterizing the acid sites of alumina surface as shown in Fig. S13 shows two distinctive peaks at 1623 cm−1 and 1614 cm−1. According to the assignment, pyridine adsorbs on Lewis acid sites (1623 cm−1) and weakly acidic surface OH groups (1614 cm−1) of the alumina surface [46]. The intensity of the 1623 cm−1 peak was significantly lowered in A600 and A750 relative to P200, suggesting that lower amounts of Lewis acid sites were produced in A600 and A750, as discussed in ethanol TPD (Fig. 1(c)). This was an apparent evidence for the difference in the amounts of cokes deposited on A750 and P200, where coke deposition was induced on the Lewis acid sites of alumina. Moreover, to confirm the relationship between coke deposits and Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface without surface modification by metal additives, we conducted TPO experiments with cokes on bare alumina formed by propylene (the condition of coke formations on bare alumina is described in the Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. S14, interestingly, quantification results of coke deposits on bare alumina from the TPO profile were 1.8 wt% (A600), 2.0 wt% (A750), and 10.9 wt% (P200), respectively, which were consistent with the results in Fig. 5. In sum up, such reduced Lewis acid sites, which can be effectively neutralized by small additions of Sn, lead to less deposition of coke, and hence better stability. Additionally, these results (Figs. 1(c) and 6(d)) demonstrated the roles of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites (Alp) in A600. Kwak et al. previously proposed that penta-coordinated sites on alumina surfaces stabilize the metal [47]. Recently, Alp-rich sites of alumina were synthesized using various methods. However, meaningful amounts of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites which seize metal particles are still under debate because Alp sites exist not only on the surface of alumina but also in the bulk. Previously, Shi et al. and Tang et al. reported that considerable amounts of Alp sites were present on synthesized Al2O3 that were capable of anchoring the metal [6,48]. Moreover, Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with many penta-coordinated Al3+ sites but revealed that most of them existed in the bulk [49]. Here, the results of DRIFTS study shown in Fig. 6(d) suggested that the dehydroxylation of Alo-OH is difficult to produce Alp sites (Lewis acid sites) on the surface. Also, PtSn on A750 which had significant lower amounts of Alp sites showed comparable stability with PtSn/A600. Thus, although A600 had abundant penta-coordinated Al3+ sites as confirmed by solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR analysis (Fig. 1(b)), the majority of these sites existed in bulk, leading to strong acid sites on alumina surface and low crystallinity of the bulk. In summary, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the strong surface acid sites suppressed metal sintering and the reduced number of residual Lewis acid sites after metal loading led to reduced coke deposition. Therefore, strong acid sites on the alumina surface and less residual Lewis acid sites are desirable for high activity and superior stability during the PDH reaction. Finally, to design active and stable alumina-based PDH catalysts, various analyses on alumina should be performed first for precise understanding of the surface properties of alumina. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we revealed that the alumina surface properties (the number and strength of acid sites) strongly influence the activity and stability of catalysts used in the PDH reaction by investigating both AACH-derived γ-Al2O3 (A750) and commercial γ-Al2O3 (P200). We were able to classify each alumina based on its surface properties using various techniques including ethanol TPD analysis and DRIFTS. From the results of ethanol TPD, A750 (Td = 262 °C, 1.04 site/nm2) showed significantly different surface properties than P200 (Td = 220.8 °C, 1.48 site/nm2), despite their similar bulk structures. Furthermore, the combined results of DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the coke precursor was initially induced on Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface. Subsequently, the Lewis acid sites were gradually opened as the deposited coke species transformed to aromatic compounds from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Consequently, the strong Lewis acid sites formed after dehydroxylation and reduced number of acid sites in A750 led to suppression of metal sintering and coke deposition, which is helpful for reducing the number of regeneration steps of the catalyst. Therefore, it is important to control the Lewis acid sites on alumina surface for superior stability. In addition, a large number of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites of A600, as evidenced by solid-state 27Al MAS-NMR, were mostly present in the bulk, and not on the surface. This study provided the direct evidences of the relation between Lewis acid sites and coke behavior and distinguished the two main causes of catalyst deactivation (metal sintering and coke deposition) even at high reaction temperatures. Furthermore, it will contribute to the development of alumina-based catalysts with high activity and superior stability for desired reactions by accurately understanding and classifying the surface properties of alumina.

        "dc:description": "The surface properties of catalyst supports are important in regulating the catalytic properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we studied the effect of acid-base properties of alumina on metal-support interaction and coke deposition, and investigated the stability of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using PtSn/Al2O3. We prepared γ-Al2O3 (A750) from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) and compared it with a commercial sample (Sasol Puralox SBA-200; P200). We loaded 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn on alumina then conducted propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C (WHSV = 5.2 h−1). PtSn/A750 and PtSn/P200 showed compatible initial activity (conversion = ˜50%) and selectivity (> 95%). After 20 h of reaction, PtSn/A750 showed a slight decrease in activity (39.9%) while the activity of PtSn/P200 dropped significantly (28.4%). Spent catalysts showed different metal sintering behavior and coke deposition which are well known causes for catalyst deactivation. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in A750 (higher Td in ethanol TPD) prevented the sintering of metal by strong metal-support interaction. Also, the lower number of Lewis acid sites in A750 than that of P200 reduced deposited coke on the catalysts (PtSn/A750: 1.8 wt% and PtSn/P200: 8.6 wt%). Furthermore, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 °C clearly demonstrated that coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at these sites. These results suggested that strong metal-support interactions to hold metal particles and less residual Lewis acid sites after metal loading to reduce coke deposition are important factors for designing stable and coke-resistant PtSn on alumina catalysts. Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability.",
