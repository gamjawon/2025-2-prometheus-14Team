Graphical abstract Oil-dispersed WS2 catalysts were prepared in situ using an oil-soluble W precursor of W(CO)6 in the hydrocracking (HCK) of vacuum residue (VR). Smaller size of WS2 catalyst (WS2-DMDS) was also obtained by the addition of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) with the W precursor in the VR HCK. The activity tests were performed in a batch reactor at 692 K at 9.5 MPa H2 with the same metal loading of 0.113 mmol. Oil-dispersed MoS2 catalyst was also employed to compare the structure and activity with WS2. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were used to examine structural properties of the dispersed catalysts. The activity based upon the H2 consumption rate per lateral metal numbers, TOFS, in the VR HCK turned out that WS2 (0.709 s−1) is better than MoS2 (0.573 s−1), which leads to higher asphaltene conversion for WS2 (39.2%) than MoS2 (35.8%). Moreover, it was noted that the dispersibility of WS2 (58.0%) was found better than MoS2 (3.3%). Keywords Vacuum residue Hydrocracking WS2 MoS2 Catalyst Oil dispersibility 1 Introduction Due to the limited supply of conventional light crude oils, the oil industry began to upgrade heavier crude oils and residues [1,2], which has drawn a lot of research on the development of catalysts for heavy oil upgrading processes [3–7]. Vacuum residue (VR), which is the heaviest and the most contaminated part of refinery process, contains high boiling point hydrocarbons above 813 K with heteroatoms of 3∼5% sulfur, 0.2∼1.0% nitrogen, and 0.1% metals in the form of hetero-organic compounds. In addition, VR includes 5–30% asphaltenes that are rich in polyaromatic compounds and heteroatoms and induce precipitation or coke formation depending on the reaction conditions [3,7]. The conversion of VR to light oil can be accomplished by pyrolysis, eg, coking and visbreaking, or hydrocracking processes [8]. Hydrocracking is more efficient process to produce light fraction oils from heavy-oils than thermal cracking, and thus much effort has been devoted to the conversion of heavy-oils in the hydrocracking process [9–18]. Due to severe coke formation arising in the conventional fixed bed hydrocrackers of heavy-oils, moving bed or ebullated bed processes have been alternatives for the residue hydrocracking [19–21]. More recently, a slurry bed hydrocracking process using oil dispersible catalysts has been demonstrated and proved to be superior to conventional VR hydrocrackers, making VR a light fuel [3,7,22–26]. This has also been reviewed [2,4,27–29]. The catalysts for the slurry phase hydrocracking are usually sub-micronic particles of metal sulfides, which are applied either ex situ by synthesis of nanoparticles followed by dispersion in oils or in situ by oil-soluble metal precursors mixed with the feed. The in situ catalysts are sulfide by means of S species that are thermally decomposed in feedstocks during temperature ramps [7]. The catalyst precursor may be a water-soluble salt, an oil-soluble metal complex or a fine powder solid. Sulfurized transition metals including Mo, Ni, Co, V and Ru have been reported to be active for hydroconversion, but MoS2 is most commonly used [30–33]. Although WS2 catalysts have been well known for superior activity over MoS2 in hydrogenation as a supported form [34–37], application of unsupported WS2 catalysts in the VR HCK has been scarce [38]. It is thus desirable to investigate the catalytic activity of dispersed WS2 catalyst in comparison to that of MoS2. In addition, differently from conventional supported metal sulfide systems, oil-dispersed catalysts require high oil dispersibility to maintain slurry phase in hydrocracking, which has not yet been completely investigated. This study thus focuses on the investigation of the effect of hydrogenation activity and oil-dispersibility of WS2 on the VR HCK. Moreover, a dispersed MoS2 catalyst was also prepared in situ to examine the difference in structure and activity from the WS2 catalysts. The goals of this work are thus to elucidate the activity of the dispersed WS2 catalysts with different morphologies in the hydrocracking of vacuum residue. Hydrocracking tests were made at 692 K and 9.5 MPa H2 in an autoclave batch reactor using a vacuum residue. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on the use of EXAFS analysis to verify the structure of the dispersed WS2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Vacuum residue (VR) as a feed was obtained from a refinery in Korea and the specifications are given in Table 1 . Hexacarbonyl molybdenum (Mo(CO)6) and hexacarbonyl tungsten (W(CO)6) were used as Mo and W precursor, respectively. Bulk MoS2 (Alfa Aesar, 99%) and WS2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.8%) were also employed as reference samples. 2.2 VR hydrocracking reaction test The hydrocracking activity tests were carried out in a 150 ml autoclave (Hanwool Engineering, Korea). 30 g of VR feedstock was loaded with W or Mo precursor of 0.113 mmol metal at room temperature into the reactor. The mixture was heated to 353 K while bubbling H2 at 1500 rpm. Thereafter, the reactor was filled to 6.0 MPa with H2 and heated to 692 K at a temperature ramping rate of 10 K / min and the H2 pressure was increased to 9.5 MPa A reaction time of zero was defined when the desired reaction temperature was reached. After each reaction test, the autoclave was cooled down to 353 K and the gaseous products were discharged. The reaction products were recovered manually and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 0.5 h to separate the liquid and the precipitate. The amount of gas production was obtained by subtracting the amount of liquid and precipitate from the initial amount of the feed VR. The boiling point distribution of the liquid products was obtained by the thermogravimetric analyzer. HCK liquid products were mixed with n-heptane (1/40, v/v) at 323 K for 5 h to separate from VR, and the mixture was filtered through a microfilter (5C, Advantec) to separate the asphaltenes. This was repeated 3 times. Then, the filtercake was washed in n-heptane for 1 h and dried in a N2 atmosphere until there was no weight change. In a similar manner, the amount of coke formation from precipitate was determined, but toluene was used as the washing and filtration solvent. In order to obtain the in situ WS2 catalysts of different sizes, 0.5 g (5.3 mmol) of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS, 99.0%, Aldrich) was added as a sulfiding agent into 30 g of VR in the presence of 0.113 mmol W(CO)6 in the VR HCK. The collected catalyst sample was denoted as WS2-DMDS. The dispersibility of the spent catalysts in the oil was also measured. To avoid coke formation reaction tests were conducted only for 0.5 h. The precipitated catalyst was then collected as toluene-insolubles, and re-dispersed in 50 ml of 1-methylnaphthalene. After centrifugation at 500 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was separated, dried, and weighed to determine the degree of dispersibility. 2.3 Characterization of catalysts Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis were used to determine structural properties of the catalysts. Size distribution of catalysts were analyzed by TEM on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by dropping hexane containing dispersed catalysts to a carbon-coated copper grid. To measure the average size of the catalysts, more than 200 particles were counted with the image analysis program, Image J 1.50i. The XAFS analysis was conducted at the Mo K-edge (19.999 keV) and W L3-edge (10.207 keV) at the beamline 8C of the Pohang Light Source (PLS), which has a flux of 2 × 1012 photons s−1 at 360 mA and 3.0 GeV. The XAFS samples were prepared by placing the slurry catalysts on a Kapton-sealed cell. The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra was Fourier transformed with 25-140 nm-1. The phase shifts and the amplitude functions were acquired from the inverse-transformed experimental EXAFS spectrum of bulk WS2 to calculate coordination number of each catalyst [5]. The inverse- transformed experimental EXAFS spectrum of the dispersed WS2 was analyzed using the curve-fitting method in the EXAFS analysis program Winxas 3.1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Activity of dispersed W and Mo catalysts in VR HCK MoS2 and WS2 adopt hexagonal structure with the same space group (P63), and have been widely used as conventional catalysts in the petroleum industry [32,31–33], especially, for hydrotreating process, where the sulfides are applied in the form of supported catalysts with Co or Ni being promoted [21,22,29]. In addition to HDS and HDN reactions, Mo and W sulfide catalysts have catalytic activity in hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons [39–42]. It has been reported that among the sulfides including Mo, Ni, Co, V, and Ru, MoS2 is the most commonly applied as a dispersed catalyst for VR HCK [30,31–33], whereas dispersed WS2 catalysts are not well known for their catalytic activity in the VR HCK. Fig. 1 shows performances of the VR HCK over the MoS2 or WS2 catalysts at 692 K and 9.5 MPa H2 respectively with 0.113 mmol W as W(CO)6 or Mo as Mo(CO)6 for 2 h. In both cases the pressure profiles were very similar, which were linearly decreased after the reaction temperature being reached, indicating H2 consumption prevailing over the catalysts. Fig. 1 also compares the product distribution along with asphaltene conversion over the catalysts in VR HCK. The asphaltene conversion of W-based catalyst was 36.5%, which is slightly higher than that of Mo-based catalyst, 35.8%. The product distribution can be classified into three phases of coke, liquid, and gas. The amounts of coke and gas formation over the catalyst were similar, where the coke formation was less than 1.0 wt% and the gas formation was less than 6 wt% in both cases. The liquid product is classified into naphtha, middle distillates (MD), vacuum gas oil (VGO), and unconverted oil (UCO), which was obtained by GC-SIMDIS analysis. It is noted that WS2 produced less UCO with more light liquid oils than MoS2, indicating higher VR conversion into light products for WS2 catalyst. It is useful to define a turn-over frequency (TOF, s−1) to compare the intrinsic activity between catalysts for the VR HCK. The surface metal number of the catalyst was estimated by assuming that the WS2 or MoS2 slab adopts hexagonal structure as reported in the literature [46], in which the average particle sizes of the catalysts were estimated from the statistical values of the TEM images. Our previous work of mono-layered MoS2 catalysts with different sizes on the VR HCK demonstrated that the TOF values based upon H2 consumption rate per total Mo number of the catalysts in the VR HCK are well correlated with the particle size distribution of MoS2 catalysts, while the TOF values based upon lateral Mo number are observed similar, indicating the rim-site Mo being the active site for the VR HCK [47]. Table 2 compares the structure and activity of MoS2 and WS2 catalysts. The reaction time 0.5 h, was thus chosen as the criteria to compare H2 consumption rate as at this condition thermal cracking can be excluded [5]. It was observed that the TOF based upon the total metal number shows slightly higher value for MoS2 than WS2 catalyst, probably due to the larger particle size of WS2, while the TOF based upon the lateral metal number shows even higher value for WS2 than MoS2 catalyst. These results suggest that the WS2 catalyst exhibits a higher intrinsic activity than the MoS2 catalyst in the VR HCK. Fig. 2 shows TEM images of the catalysts collected after VR HCK tests. It is observed that mono-layered particles of 10 nm in size are formed in the Mo-based catalyst. Our previous work also confirmed well-dispersed MoS2 single slabs of 10 nm in size in the VR HCK [47]. In the similar manner Bellussi et al. [7] also reported that unsupported MoS2 catalysts are formed and maintained the morphology of mono-slabs smaller than 10 nm in size for the VR HCK within a limited contact time less than 2 h at 703 K and 13 MPa. Similarly, the W-based catalyst also formed mono-slabs with an average particle size of 13.9 nm which is slightly larger than the Mo-based catalyst. These results suggest that the oil-soluble W precursor is transformed into lamella shape particles in the VR HCK which are well dispersed in the heavy oils. To examine the phase of the dispersed catalysts, EXAFS analysis was performed on the samples taken after the reaction tests. Fig. 3 shows the Mo K-edge EXAFS spectrum of the Mo catalyst and that of bulk MoS2. It was observed that the bulk MoS2 reference shows two major peaks in the Fourier transform (FT) at 0.195 nm and 0.287 nm, corresponding to 6 Mo-S and 6 Mo-Mo, respectively [47,48]. The FT spectrum for the dispersed Mo sample also exhibit two peaks similarly to the bulk MoS2 spectrum, implying the formation of MoS2. These results suggest that Mo(CO)6, an oil-soluble Mo precursor, undergoes in situ sulfidation from thermally decomposed S species of VR during the temperature ramping process, as also observed in previous studies [1]. Moreover, it can be noted the peak intensities of Mo-S and Mo-Mo contribution were lower than those of the bulk MoS2. These results thus suggest that the formation of the MoS2 phase prefers lower Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordinations than those of bulk MoS2, due to the smaller particle size of the dispersed MoS2 with abundant exposed sites as the active phase. W L3-edge EXAFS analysis was also employed for the W-based catalyst. Fig. 4 shows the W L3-edge EXAFS spectra of the catalyst and bulk WS2 reference. The Fourier transform (FT) of the bulk WS2 reference retains two major peaks at 0.205 nm and 0.303 nm, corresponding to 6 W-S and 6 W-W, respectively [49]. The FT spectrum for the dispersed WS2 sample also exhibit two peaks similarly to the bulk WS2 spectrum, indicating the formation of WS2. Similarly to the MoS2 catalysts, the peak intensities of W-S and W-W contribution appeared lower than those of the bulk WS2. Again, this indicates the abundance of exposed W sites due to the small particle formation. Given the same amount of metal loadings of W and Mo in the VR HCK, WS2 catalyst was found to form larger particle size than MoS2 but showed better activity in the VR HCK in terms of TOF based upon the lateral metal number. Again, these results suggest that the WS2 catalyst exhibits a higher intrinsic activity than the MoS2 catalyst in the VR HCK. It is thus desirable to obtain smaller particle size of the WS2 catalyst to raise the extent of catalyst utilization. 3.2 Size effect of WS2 catalyst on VR HCK As described above in Section 3.1, WS2 forms mono-slab particles larger than MoS2 at the same VR HCK conditions. This is associated with the difference in the degree of sulfidation of the metal precursors. It is known that W requires a higher temperature for sulfidation than Mo [50], which could lead to the formation of large particles. In order to obtain smaller size of WS2, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) as a sulfidation agent was employed as the DMDS is widely used to facilitate metal sulfidation due to the low decomposition temperature of about 573 K [51]. Fig. 5 compares the performance of the WS2 catalysts in the VR HCK at 692 K and 9.5 MPa H2 with 0.113 mmol W. It is observed that the addition of DMDS leads to the increase of the H2 consumption rate in comparison to the WS2 catalyst, which resulted in the increase of asphaltene conversion. As shown in Fig. 2, the TEM images of the WS2-DMDS catalyst is observed to form mono-layered slabs, and it is obvious that the average particle size of the WS2-DMDS is smaller than the WS2 catalyst (10.6 vs. 13.9 nm). These results are supportive to the activity results of Fig. 5, where WS2-DMDS exhibits better H2 consumption rate and asphaltene conversion than WS2 catalyst. Taking into account the smaller size of the WS2-DMDS, having more exposed W sites, the WS2-DMDS is beneficial to the VR HCK. Fig. 6 displays W L3-edge EXAFS spectra for the WS2 and WS2-DMDS catalysts. The FT spectrum of the WS2-DMDS catalyst exhibit two peaks at 0.205 nm and 0.303 nm, corresponding to W-S and W-W coordinations, respectively [49], indicating the formation of WS2. As also described above in the W L3-edge EXAFS spectra for the WS2 samples, the peak intensities of W-S and W-W contribution appeared lower than those of the bulk WS2, due to the abundance of exposed W sites for the small particles. Table 3 summarizes EXAFS curve-fitting results, which confirmed a lower coordination number of W-W for WS2-DMDS catalyst. Again, these results support the smaller size of WS2-DMDS than WS2. 3.3 Intrinsic activity of MoS2 and WS2 catalysts in VR HCK Hydrocracking of vacuum residue at high temperature generally comprises thermal cracking and catalytic hydrogenation, where hydrocarbon radicals generated via thermal decomposition of the heavy-oils are hydrogenated to give light hydrocarbons [1]. In this regard, the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is of great importance. The hydrocracking catalyst not only promotes hydrogenation of the hydrocarbon radicals but also limits excessive decomposition or polymerization, thereby suppressing the coke formation and gaseous by-products. Generally, the active sites for conventional supported MoS2 catalysts are explained by the rim-edge model, in which MoS2 forms hexagonal or triangular slabs and the exposed edge sites are accepted as active sites in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) or hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [46]. Our previous studies verified that the H2 consumption rate, i.e. TOF, with respect to the particle size of MoS2 is well correlated with Mo dispersion profiles, demonstrating that the exposed Mo is the active site for the VR HCK [5]. In the similar manner, a theoretical dispersion of lateral metal sites of WS2 as a function of the particle size was obtained as displayed in Fig. 7 . It can be observed that the TOF values of WS2 and WS2–DMDS in the VR HCK are well correlated with the rime–site model of mono-layered WS2 slab. Table 2 also compares the TOF values between MoS2 and WS2. The TOF values of the MoS2 based upon the total number of metals was found slightly higher than that of WS2, 0.0674 s−1 for MoS2, and 0.0602 s−1 for WS2, which is expected due to a smaller particle size of MoS2 catalyst, having more exposed metal sites than WS2. However, the TOF based upon the lateral metal number shows the opposite results of 0.573 s−1 for MoS2, and 0.711 s−1 for WS2, indicating that the lateral W site of WS2 is more active than that of MoS2 in the VR HCK. In particular, smaller WS2, WS2-DMDS, of which particle size is close to that of dispersed MoS2, shows even higher TOF based upon total metal number in the VR HCK than MoS2, indicating superior activity of WS2 in the VR HCK over MoS2. Note that TOF based upon lateral W number show similar values between WS2 and WS2-DMDS, demonstrating that the lateral W sites are active site in the VR HCK (Fig. 7). 3.4 Oil-dispersibility of WS2 in VR Unlike conventional fixed bed reactor systems, a slurry process requires dispersion of the catalyst to obtain a good mixture. Panariti et al. compared the catalytic performances of dispersed metal sulfides and revealed that the activity in the hydrocracking of petroleum residue is inversely proportional to the particle size of the catalysts in the order of Mo > Ru > Co > V > Fe [6]. Our recent study of the effect of oil-dispersibility of dispersed transition metal sulfide catalysts on the VR HCK demonstrated that the catalytic activity in slurry phase hydrocracking is strongly influenced by the oil-dispersibility of the catalyst, following the order of MoS2 > Co9S8 > Ni3S2, [5]. The oil-dispersibility of the catalysts was measured, and as given in Table 2, the colloidal stability was in the order of WS2 > MoS2. The dispersed MoS2 catalyst having a particle size smaller than WS2 exhibits a low oil-dispersibility of 3.3%, indicating poor colloidal stability compared to WS2. For the WS2 catalysts, the TOFT values based upon the total W numbers was found to be higher for the WS2-DMDS than the WS2, while the TOFS values based upon the number of lateral W sites were observed very similar each other. These results thus suggest that although the oil-dispersibility of the WS2 catalyst could increase the catalytic stability of the dispersed catalyst in the slurry phase hydrocracking process, it rarely affects the intrinsic activity of the WS2 catalysts in the VR HCK. 4 Conclusions Oil-dispersed WS2 and MoS2 catalysts were prepared in situ for hydrocracking (HCK) of vacuum residue (VR) to investigate to the effect of the hydrogenation activity and oil-dispersibility of the sulfides on the VR HCK at 693 K and 9.5 MPa in H2. TEM and EXAFS analysis revealed that both Mo and W precursors form nano-scaled mono-slab WS2 and MoS2 particles of 10–15 nm in size, while the WS2 shows higher intrinsic activity in terms of TOF based on the lateral metal number than MoS2 in the VR HCK. Moreover, it was noteworthy that the smaller WS2 particles can be synthesized in situ by the addition of dimethyl disulfide in feed and show even better oil-dispersibility and activity in the VR HCK than the MoS2 catalyst. Overall, the high hydrogenation activity of the dispersed WS2 in combination with oil-dispersibility has been demonstrated to allow good catalytic activity in the VR HCK.
