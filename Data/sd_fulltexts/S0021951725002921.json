Graphical abstract This study investigates the impact of molecular configuration on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the dyad photosensitizers (DPSs) applied to Pt/TiO2 nanoparticles. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, chlorophyll-derived DPSs with varying linkage lengths were synthesized. Through operando high-pressure transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the interplay between molecular configuration and electron injection processes from DPSs to TiO2 was elucidated. DPS-L8@TiO2 with 8-bond length linkage demonstrated superior HER efficiency due to the optimized charge transfer kinetics. The findings contribute to the design of efficient photosensitizers for solar energy conversion, highlighting the significance of molecular design in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.

However, the limited utilization efficiency of conventional inorganic semiconductors in the visible region of sunlight necessitates innovative strategies to broaden their spectral response [4,5]. Dye-sensitization has emerged as a promising approach to enhance both the light absorption and carrier separation efficiency of inorganic photocatalysts [6–12]. While single organic-dye molecules can effectively extend the light absorption ability of these semiconductors, multi-chromophores have demonstrated the enhanced potential for generating photoexcited electrons and facilitating charge transfer. We recently reported a series of dyad photosensitizers (DPSs) applicable for Pt/TiO2 nanoparticles in photocatalytic HER, showing improved efficiency compared to those of each chromophore unit [13–15]. However, the underlying electron transfer mechanism for these enhancements is unclear. In this work, semi-synthetic chlorophyll DPSs (DPS-L6, DPS-L8, and DPS-L11 in Chart 1 ) are designed and synthesized by mimicking the natural photosynthesis architectures, [16–18] which consist of a carboxylated-chlorin (CC) and other accessory chlorins (ACs) with specific distances and orientation, distinguished by the length of linkage between two chlorins of 6, 8, and 11 covalent bonds. By operando high-pressure transient absorption spectroscopy (HP-TAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the interplay between molecular configuration and electron transfer kinetics is elucidated. 2 Results and discussion The structures of DPSs are characterized by the π-conjugated carboxy group at the C32 position on CC unit, which is used to bind the DPS molecule covalently on the surface of TiO2. Meanwhile, the other chlorin unit is introduced as an accessory chromophore to compensate for the light-absorption ability of CC. The optimization of DPSs' structure was performed through the first-principles calculations utilizing DFT as implemented in the QuantumATK simulation tool [19]. The results show that within the DPSs, in addition to different distances, the dihedral angle between the chromophores is also contingent upon the tethering bond length. Specifically, for DPS-L6, this dihedral angle is 87.75°, while those for DPS-L11 and DPS-L8, are 63.93° and 62.74°, respectively. Consequently, the nearly orthogonal alignment of the two chlorin units in DPS-L6 is expected to be less effective for intramolecular energy transfer compared to their counterparts in DPS-L8 and DPS-L11, thereby impacting the kinetics of electron transfer within the molecule. Dye-sensitization of TiO2 with DPSs was carried out as illustrated in Fig. 1 a, and the obtained Pt/TiO2 effectively broadened the light absorption range of TiO2 into the visible region. As depicted in Fig. 1 b, all DPSs exhibit typical absorption spectra characteristic of chlorophyll derivatives, and their extinction coefficients are nearly identical. The absorption spectrum of DPS-L6 exhibits a little fine structure compared to those of DPS-L8 and DPS-L11, which is mainly ascribable to the electronic effect of C3-substituent on AC units [20]. Additionally, the slight red-shift of the photoluminescence (PL) peak of DPS-L6 indicates the weak intramolecular interaction between the two chlorin units, since the fluorescence emission of all three DPSs occurs from the common CC unit of which Qy peak is located at the longer-wavelength region than those of AC units (Fig. 1 c). Time-resolved photoluminescence decay curves of DPSs at their strongest emission peaks are shown in Fig. 1 d. The decay curves were biexponentially fitted, and the results are summarized in Table S1. As the bond linkage lengths increase, it becomes more difficult for the photoexcited electrons to transfer intramolecularly from AC to CC. Accordingly, they tend to result in direct recombination within the AC chromophore. Although the DPSs possess similar chemical structures, the resistance for charge transfer and recombination varies after chemisorption on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1 e). Using the transmission line model proposed by J. Bisquert et al., DPS-L6@TiO2 exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance [21]. However, the recombination resistance for DPS-L6@TiO2 is also the smallest, suggesting that the recombination process is most likely to occur in spite of its efficient charge transfer. The energy levels and frontier molecular orbitals of DPSs based on DFT calculations are shown in Fig. 1 f. Intramolecular π–π interactions in DPS molecules are influenced by the distances and angles between CC and AC units, affecting the HOMO and LUMO levels. As the linkage lengths increase, these orbitals shift upwards without significantly altering the bandgap. A simplified model based on the dye-sensitized semiconductor–metal heterostructures for the photocatalytic process is displayed in Fig. 2 a [22–24]. The following photochemical processes occur after a DPS molecule is excited by visible light illumination, generating electron-hole pairs. The electrons at LUMOs of DPS can recombine with the holes left at HOMOs with rate factor ke-h ; the holes can be trapped by the electrons of the sacrificial agent with rate factor of kHS ; the electrons at LUMOs can also transfer to the surface of TiO2 via the anchoring chemical bond of CC to TiO2 as well as spatial charge transfer between the remote AC chromophore to nearby TiO2 surface with rate factor of k1 and k2 , respectively; then the transferred electrons face with two competing movement processes, i.e. recombine with the holes of DPSs with rate factor of kRE or further shift to Pt atoms with rate factor of kET . Finally, the electrons at the surface of Pt can participate in the proton reduction process with a rate factor of kPR and generate hydrogen. In this simplified model, the individual processes either contribute to or inhibit the final HER performance, and the quantum efficiency can be described by the following equation: (1) QE H 2 = k 1 + k 2 + k ET k 1 + k 2 + k HS + k e - h + k ET ∗ k PR k PR + k RE It was found that DPS-L6, possessing the shortest distance linkage did not exhibit the highest hydrogen production efficiency (Fig. 2 b). This somewhat unexpected result is assumed to arise because the AC unit in DPS-L6 is nearly perpendicular to the TiO2 plane, which results in a minimal projection surface on TiO2. This orientation hinders the spatial charge transfer process, thereby reducing the number of photogenerated electrons that ultimately participate in the HER. The lowest HER capability of DPS-L11 is attributed to a combination of the weaker spatial charge transfer strength and the significantly weaker intramolecular charge transfer strength due to the longer distance between CC and AC. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of TiO2 after sensitization by each DPS was tested using a conventional dye-sensitized solar cell as a model, and corresponding current–voltage (J-V) responses are shown in Fig. S19. The highest EQE was obtained for DPS-L8 among the three DPSs, which is consistent with the HER results (Fig. 2 b). Since the water contact angles of three DPS@TiO2 (Fig. S20) are nearly same, the electron transfer process between each DPS and TiO2 is regarded to be a decisive factor affecting the final HER performance. Consistency and stability tests (Fig. 2 d and e) reveal that the DPS-L8@TiO2 photocatalyst can undergo at least three HER cycles with nearly identical H2 evolution curves and minimal batch-to-batch variations, demonstrating excellent long-term stability and reproducibility. To clarify the synergistic impact of k1 and k2 process, DPS@TiO2 composite models were subjected to calculation on the located density of electronic states (LDOS). As can be seen in Fig. 3 a However, the AC units also show electron distribution on the projection of the TiO2 surface, a process that is directly related to the k2 process, which appears to be significantly stronger for DPS-L8 than for the other DPSs. Fig. 3 b displays the 2D pseudocolour TAS of DPS@TiO2 in the 450–650 nm range, revealing distinct excited state absorption (ESA) decay signals attributed to the excited electron transfer from DPSs to TiO2. Due to the flexible linkages, DPSs exhibit drastic intramolecular configuration changes under high-pressure environments (Fig. 3 c). When pressure increases, a notable quenching of photoluminescence is observed, along with an evident red-shift in the absorption edges for all DPSs. According to the “Aggregation-Caused Quenching Theory”, these phenomena can be explained by pressure-induced enhancement of π-π interactions [25,26]. It is expected that the planes of two chlorin macrocycles transit from being intersecting to becoming more parallel with increasing the surrounding pressure. The kinetic curves at the wavelength regions where ESA decay occurred for each DPS@TiO2 were also analyzed. The fitting results of kinetic curves under ambient pressure reveal two distinct components corresponding to k1 and k2 processes, of which the relative contributions vary among the three DPS@TiO2 composites (Fig. 3 d–f). For instance, in the case of DPS-L6@TiO2, the k1 and k2 processes account for 52.30 % and 47.70 %, of the total electron transfer, respectively. The k1 process predominates in DPS-L6@TiO2, whereas the k2 process has a higher percentage in DPS-L8@TiO2 (51.54 %) and DPS-L11@TiO2 (49.09 %). The slightly higher value in DPS-L8@TiO2 compared to DPS-L11@TiO2 is ascribable to the different AC angle to TiO2 plane, affecting the spatial over-lapping area and the distance between the AC chromophore and TiO2 surface. When the pressure is increased, the AC unit tends to form a mutually perpendicular positional relationship with the TiO2 plane, and the k2 process is significantly suppressed. Visual evidence supporting this interpretation is provided by the significant decrease in the percentage of k2 processes with increasing pressure across all DPS@TiO2. Additionally, the lifetime of the k2 processes increases significantly, indicating that the k2 process becomes more difficult as pressure increases. From the observations of operando HP-TAS measurements, we have gained further insights into the performance of DPS@Pt/TiO2 composite in photocatalytic HER. The k2 process in DPS-L6@TiO2 is severely inhibited, causing nearly all electron transfer to TiO2 to occur via the anchoring bond. This single transfer pathway increases the probability of electron-hole recombination. In DPS-L8@TiO2, the concomitant of the two electron transport paths with similar probabilities significantly enhances the efficiency of charge transfer, resulting in the best HER performance. Conversely, in the case of DPS-L11@TiO2, despite the presence of both electron transfer paths, the longer distance between the two chromophores results in a suppressed number of electrons transferring via the k1 process, while the k2 process proceeds more slowly. This leads to a substantial amount of electron-hole recombination, resulting in the poorest HER performance. 3 Conclusions In summary, we explored the impact of molecular configuration on the photocatalytic HER performance of DPSs. Among the three DPSs with different bond lengths, DPS-L8@Pt/TiO2 significantly outperformed others due to its optimized charge transfer pathways to utilize the photoexcited energy for HER. The use of operando HP-TAS techniques revealed the electron transfer dynamics, emphasizing the importance of molecular design in enhancing photocatalysis efficiency. This work provides a clue to the design of multi-chromophore photosensitizers for solar energy conversion and deepens the knowledge of hybrid photocatalysts. 4 Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
