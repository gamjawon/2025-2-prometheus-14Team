In this work, the two-step one-pot procedure for the synthesis of N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines was proposed, which includes two successive reactions: the condensation of 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) with primary amines and the reduction of obtained imines with hydrogen over supported metal catalysts in a flow reactor. The comparison of the properties of Au, Pd and Pt catalysts in the hydrogenation of imine obtained by reaction of AMF with aniline showed that Pt-based catalysts (both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C) are highly active and provide high selectivity and stability, while Pd and Au nanoparticles supported on γ-alumina and carbon show low selectivity. A wide range of N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines was synthesized in good to excellent yields using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and methanol as a solvent. Keywords Reductive amination 5-Acetoxymethylfurfural Pt/Al2O3catalyst Primary amines Flow hydrogenation Introduction N-Substituted 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines are an important class of compounds due to their pharmaceutical activities such as muscarinic agonists, calcium antagonists, cholinergic agents, antifilarial agents and pyriculariaoryzae inhibitors [1,2]. Generally, these structures are produced from furfural alcohol (or furfural) by reaction with formaldehyde and primary amine. However, the reported procedures usually require long reaction time and harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and pressure. Therefore, development of efficient and environmentally friendly methods for production of aminomethylhydroxymethylfuran (AMHMF) derivatives is of great interest. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) obtained from generally available non-edible lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive initial material for synthesis of this class of compounds by the reaction of reductive amination [3–8]. Indeed, several recent studies have shown that it is possible to achieve the amino functionalization of HMF by reductive amination using (i) molecular H2 in presence of a homogenous ruthenium-based catalyst [3], carbon-supported Fe-Ni catalyst [4], Pd/C [5], and Pd nanoparticles immobilized in a MOF/polymer composite [6]; (ii) CO/H2O reducing system in presence of TiO2-supported gold catalyst [7] or (iii) stoichiometric NaBH4 [8]. However, a major limitation for commercial application of HMF as a source of AMHMF production is its low stability and, as a consequence, the high market price [9–14]. Esters of HMF, which can be prepared from carbohydrates without isolating HMF, are less reactive, more stable and easily extracted from the aqueous reaction mixture, and thus represent a good substitute for HMF [10–15]. In this connection, 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) [11–13] is of significant interest in obtaining AMHMF derivatives that can be easily converted to N-substituted 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines by hydrolysis [16]. When the reductive amination is performed in one step (direct reductive amination), carbonyl compound is partially hydrogenated to alcohol that reduces the amine yield [17–19]. However, this drawback can be overcome by two-stage synthesis with non-catalytic formation of intermediate imine during the first stage followed by its catalytic hydrogenation at the second stage. In our previous work, various secondary amines were obtained in good to excellent yields by two-step one-pot reductive amination, which involves the condensation of aromatic aldehydes with primary amines in methanol at room temperature, followed by hydrogenation in a flow reactor over heterogeneous Cu-based catalyst [20]. In this study, we examined the efficiency of two-step one-pot procedure for reductive amination of AMF with primary amines through flow hydrogenation of the intermediate imines over supported Pt, Pd and Au catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, the applied procedure for the synthesis of aminomethylhydroxymethylfuran derivatives has not yet been described in the literature. Experimental part Chemicals 5-Acetoxymethylfurfural (97%), aniline (99.8%), o-toluidine (99%), m-toluidine (99%), p-toluidine (99%), p-anisidine (99%), cyclohexylamine (99%), o-chloroaniline (98+%), m-chloroaniline (99%), p-chloroaniline (98%), p-bromoaniline (99+%), p-fluoroaniline (98%), p-iodoaniline (99+%), n-dodecylamine (98%), n-hexylamine (99%) and p-aminoacetophenone (99%) from Acros Organics, as well as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (99%) from Sigma-Aldrich, were used without additional purification. Methanol (99.8%, J.T. Baker), ethanol (99.9%, J.T. Baker) and isopropanol (99.5%, Acros Organics) were employed as a solvent. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate HAuCl4 aq. (49.47 wt% Au, “Aurat” Russia), H2PdCl4 prepared from PdCl2 (pure grade, 59.9 wt% Pd, “Reachim” Russia), HCl (extra pure grade, “Sigma Tech” Russia), K2PtCl4 (98%, Sigma Aldrich), H2PtCl6×6H2O (pure grade, 37.77 wt% Pt, “Reachim” Russia), l-arginine hydrochloride (CAS 1119−34-2, Fisher Biotech) and Sibunit support (made in IHCP SB RAS, Omsk, Russia) were used to prepare the catalysts. The γ-alumina support was prepared by extrusion of a paste obtained by mixing of aluminium oxide (Puralox TH 100/150, Sasol), aluminium oxyhydroxide (Disperal 20, Sasol) and aqueous solution of nitric acid as peptizing agent followed by drying and calcining at 550 °C [21]. The obtained γ-Al2O3 granules were then crushed and sieved to separate support grains of 0.25–0.50 mm in size. The texture properties of γ-Al2O3 was found to be as follows: BET specific surface area – 162 m2 g−1, total pore volume – 0.69 cm3 g−1, mean pore diameter – 18.6 nm. Carbon-supported catalysts were prepared using Sibunit carbon (fraction of 0.25–0.50 mm) with BET specific surface area of 365 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.68 cm3 g−1 and mean pore diameter of 7.4 nm [22]. Catalyst preparation The Au/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by “deposition–precipitation” technique according to the known procedure [21]. Au/C catalyst was obtained similarly to the method described in [23]. Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by hydrolysis of H2PdCl4 and K2PtCl4, respectively. For this purpose, a solution of H2PdCl4 (K2PtCl4) with required amount of metal was added drop-wise to suspension of γ-Al2O3 in aqueous NaHCO3, for atomic ratios of Na/Pd = 16 or Na/Pt = 14 to be finally reached, at 5 °C (Pd) or 90 °C (Pt). After completing the addition of a solution of metal complexes, the suspension was allowed to be aged for 15 min then boiled for 10 min. The samples were washed with hot water, dried in air at 80 °C for a night, heated in nitrogen to 200 °C and left for 10 min. Finally, the catalyst was heat-treated in hydrogen flow at the same temperature for 0.5 h, then cooled, purged with nitrogen and passivated with small portions of air added to nitrogen flow. Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts were synthesized by adsorption of H2PdCl4 and H2PtCl6 on Sibunit support from aqueous solutions, followed by hydrolysis of the adsorbed species with NaHCO3 solution (added drop-wise to attain Na/Pd = 4 or Na/Pt = 6 ratios) at room temperature for 0.5 h, then at 90 °C for 10 min. After the addition of an excess amount of NaHCO3 solution (Na/Pd = 1 or Na/Pt = 2), the heating was continued for 20 min more. Other procedures were performed by the same manner as for Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Catalyst characterization The metal content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy on an Optima 4300 DV instrument (Perkin Elmer, USA). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out using a JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) electron microscope with a lattice resolution of 0.14 nm and a 200 kV accelerating voltage. The mean diameters of metal particles (dTEM ) for each catalyst sample were determined by counting of 250–300 particles in TEM images taken with a medium magnification. TG-DSC-MS measurement was performed in an apparatus consisting of a STA 449 F1 Jupiter thermal analyzer and a QMS 403D Aeolos quadrupole mass spectrometer (NETZSCH, Germany) as described in [21]. Apparent surface-average diameter (dchem ) of metal particles in supported palladium and platinum catalysts was also calculated with the use of data on pulse CO chemisorption in H2 flow, assuming that each Pt and Pd surface atom adsorbs one CO molecule. Before testing, the catalysts were pre-treated with hydrogen at 150 °C for 30 min. Gas titration was performed by 10 vol.% CO/90 vol.% H2 mixture at 20 °C [24]. Catalysts performance The solution of AMF (0.05 M) and primary amine (0.05 M) in methanol was kept at 25 °C for 2–16 h, depending on the nucleophilic properties of the amine. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was mixed with H2 and pumped through the flow reactor packed with the catalyst. Catalytic runs were carried out in H-Cube Pro setup (Thalesnano, Hungary) equipped with a 30 mm CatCart cartridge (CatCart®30, 0.30 mL empty volume) [20,21,25]. In the case of Pt- and Pd-based samples, the catalyst (0.185 g) was preliminarily reduced with hydrogen dissolved in methanol at 70 °C for 15 min (H2 pressure of 5 bar, hydrogen flow rate of 30 mL min−1). The pure solvent was then changed to the reaction mixture and this point in time was chosen as the starting point of the experiment. The reaction was performed at temperature of 10–120 °C, H2 pressure of 5–10 bar, liquid feed rate of 0.5 mL min−1 and hydrogen flow rate of 30 mL min−1 (H2/AMF molar ratio was 54). The use of a high flow rate of H2 allows us to avoid the influence of external mass transfer in the course of the reaction [25]. The performance of the catalyst was evaluated by analysis of the samples taken in the interval of 30–33 min from the beginning of the experiment. The composition of the reaction products was determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3. The corresponding spectra and their interpretation are available in Supplementary Material. The error in determining the yield is ±1%. Results and discussion The efficiency of one-pot strategy is defined by the ability of successive reaction to proceed in the same solvent with the highest yield of the desired product. Methanol is a suitable solvent for the synthesis of N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines, since it is a good solvent for both the condensation of aromatic aldehydes with primary amines and for hydrogenation of imines [8,19,20]. We found that the reaction of AMF (or HMF) with aniline in methanol occurs at room temperature with imine yield of 98% (Table 1 , entries 1 and 2) and time dependence of imine yield let us to see that equilibrium concentrations are reached within 2 h (Supplementary Material). The use of ethanol instead of methanol in the condensation of HMF and aniline leads to a decrease in the yield of imine 1а−OH to 70% (Table 1, entry 3). Simultaneously, the yield of 1а−OH in isopropanol is only 31% under the same reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 4). The imine 1a obtained by reaction of AMF with aniline in methanol during 2 h were further hydrogenated over Au-, Pd- and Pt-based catalysts supported on γ-alumina and Sibunit carbon. The list and physicochemical properties of the catalysts used in the present study are shown in Table 2 . According to TEM, the average diameter (dTEM ) of gold nanoparticles in Au/Al2O3 and Au/C samples was 2.4 and 1.7 nm, respectively. The TEM study of the Pt/Al2O3 sample indicated that Pt nanoparticles are of about 1 nm in size. At the same time, the mean size of nanoparticles in Pt/C, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/C catalysts was 1.6, 1.9 and 1.8 nm, respectively (Supplementary Material). The average diameter (dchem ) of metal particles in supported palladium and platinum catalysts was also evaluated by pulse CO chemisorption in H2 flow, assuming that each Pt and Pd surface atom adsorbs one CO molecule [24]. The mean size of Pt particles in the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C samples was found to be 1.0 nm, while Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/C catalysts contained larger particles (2.3–2.7 nm). These data correlate with the TEM results. The hydrogenation of imine 1a over gold catalysts in a flow reactor leads to the formation of AMHMF derivative with a low selectivity. Au/Al2O3 showed 43% yield of 2a at 98% conversion of 1a at 120 °C (Table 3 , entry 1). In addition to 2a, undesired secondary amine 3a and imine 4a were observed among the reaction products. At the same time, Au/C catalyst exhibits very low activity in imine hydrogenation (Table 3, entry 2). Pd/Al2O3 catalyst has much higher activity: complete conversion of 1a was observed at 25 °C and 5 bar H2. However, the reaction proceeds with low selectivity towards 2a due to the formation of a large amount of 3a (Table 3, entry 3). Reducing the reaction temperature to 10 °C allows increasing the yield up to 85% (Table 3, entry 4). The Pd/C catalyst provides a similar yield of 2a (86%) under these conditions (Table 3, entry 5). In contrast to Au- and Pd-based samples, platinum catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C) produce 2a with very high selectivity. The yield of 2a is 99% at the complete conversion of 1a (Table 3, entries 6 and 7). The use of ethanol or isopropanol instead of methanol leads to a severe drop in the yield of the desired product (Table 3, entries 8 and 9) due to the much lower yield of imine in the first stage (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). As a result, AMF is partially hydrogenated to 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol 5. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is also capable to mediate hydrogenation of imine 1a−OH, which is obtained by condensation of HMF and aniline in methanol at room temperature for 2 h (Table 1, entry 2). It was found that reductive amination of HMF, carried out in the manner described above for AMF, leads to the formation of 6 with the yield of 98% (Scheme 1 ). The effect of primary amine structure on the formation of AMHMF derivatives was studied using the reaction between AMF and different aromatic and aliphatic amines over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Table 4 ). Similar to aniline, aromatic amines containing electron-donating substituent (CH3 and OCH3) in meta- and para-position react with AMF to form 2b, 2c and 2e with the yield of 99% (Table 4, entries 2, 3 and 6). The rate of imine formation in the condensation of AMF and o-toluidine is much lower than that in the reaction of AMF with aniline that is explained by steric hindrance created by methyl group in ortho-position [20,21]. However, the reaction of AMF with o-toluidine for 16 h at the first stage, followed by hydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, allows the synthesis of 2d with the yield of 96 − 97% (Table 4, entries 4 and 5). Introduction of electron-withdrawing substituent (F, Cl, Br, I, C(O)CH3) in the para-position of aniline decreases the yield of compounds 2 (Table 4, entries 7 − 13) due to weaker nucleophilic properties of corresponding aromatic amines in comparison with aniline that results in lower imine yield at the first stage [20,21]. The nucleophilicity decreases in the following order: p-fluoroaniline > p-chloroaniline > p-bromoaniline ∼ p-iodoaniline > p-aminoacetophenon due to the different inductive and mesomeric effects of the substituents [20]. The yield of desired product is reduced in the same order of electron-withdrawing substituents: F (2f, 98%) ∼ Cl (2g, 97%) > Br (2h, 88%) ∼ I(2i, 87%) >> C(O)CH3 (2j, 41%). Thus, the yield of AMHMF derivatives is determined by the imine formation at the first stage. Higher yield of the intermediate imine provides higher yield of corresponding product 2. The position of electron-withdrawing substituent in aromatic amine also has a strong influence on the reaction. The AMHMF derivatives yield in the reaction between AMF and chloroaniline isomers is reduced in the following order: p-chloroaniline (2g, 97%) > m-chloroaniline (2k, 83%) >> o-chloroaniline (2l, 49%), which is explained by a decrease of the nucleophilic properties (Table 4, entries 8, 14 − 16). In addition, imines derived from m-chloroaniline and o-chloroaniline are more difficult to hydrogenate than imine obtained from p-chloroaniline. This is probably due to the steric hindrance created by Cl substituent. It was found that Cl group has remained unconverted during the reaction at 25−55 °C (Table 4, entries 8, 14−16). Hydrodebromination is absent at 25 °C (Table 4, entry 9), while it becomes noticeable at 35 °C (Table 4, entry 10). In the case of p-iodoaniline, the yield of hydrodehalogenated product was 23% at 25 °C (Table 4, entry 11). However, a decrease of reaction temperature to 15 °C reduces the hydrogenation rate of the C−I bond and allows synthesizing the compound 2i with the yield of 87% (Table 4, entry 12). In addition, aliphatic amines (n-hexylamine, cyclohexylamine and n-dodecylamine) gave significantly lower yields of AMHMF derivatives (2m, 2n and 2o) than aniline (Table 4, entries 17−21) due to hydrogenation of acetyl group in the target products. The time-on-stream test in the reductive amination of AMF with aniline over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst showed that the yield of 2a (99%) remained unchanged for 2.5 h. Thus, the catalyst exhibits good stability during the reaction. The spent catalyst was investigated using atomic absorption spectroscopy and TG-DSC-MS analysis. It was found that the Pt content did not change visibly after the reaction. Simultaneously, TG-DSC-MS measurement indicated that the spent catalyst contained approximately 4.5 wt% of hydrogen-enriched carbonaceous species (Supplementary Material) [20,21]. It seems that the formation of carbonaceous deposits during 2.5 h of catalytic test does not affect the activity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Conclusions In summary, an environmentally friendly procedure was developed for the synthesis of aminomethylhydroxymethylfuran derivatives through a two-step one-pot reductive amination of 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF). The stepwise process, including non-catalytic condensation of AMF with primary amines and the subsequent hydrogenation of the obtained imine over supported metal catalyst in a flow reactor, was successfully performed using methanol as a solvent. Platinum catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C) provide the formation of various N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines in good to excellent yields (up to 99%) under mild reaction conditions (25–55 °C and 5 bar H2), while Pd and Au nanoparticle supported on γ-alumina and carbon exhibited low selectivity. The proposed approach represents a novel way for the production of the valuable aminomethylhydroxymethylfurans. CRediT authorship contribution statement Alexey L.

        "dc:description": "Aminomethylhydroxymethylfuran derivatives are well known for their pharmaceutical activities. In this work, the two-step one-pot procedure for the synthesis of N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines was proposed, which includes two successive reactions: the condensation of 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) with primary amines and the reduction of obtained imines with hydrogen over supported metal catalysts in a flow reactor. The comparison of the properties of Au, Pd and Pt catalysts in the hydrogenation of imine obtained by reaction of AMF with aniline showed that Pt-based catalysts (both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C) are highly active and provide high selectivity and stability, while Pd and Au nanoparticles supported on γ-alumina and carbon show low selectivity. A wide range of N-substituted 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furfuryl amines was synthesized in good to excellent yields using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and methanol as a solvent.",
