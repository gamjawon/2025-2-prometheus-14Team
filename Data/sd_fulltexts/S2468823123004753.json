The mechanism of the NO conversion to poisonous substrates, such as NH3 and N2O on a model Pt/CeO2+Rh/LA three-way catalyst (TWC) during the treatment of exhaust emission from natural gas vehicles (NGVs) was investigated. The in situ DRIFTS results showed that the main pathway of NO reduction is the reaction of nitrite/nitrate species formed by NO adsorbed on CeO2 with CH4. It was further elucidated by O1s and DRIFTS that the formation of N2O at low temperature is ascribed to competitive reactions of cyanide (-CN) species with O2 and NOx. Specifically, for Pt/Ce catalysts, N2 and CO2 are formed due to the preferential reaction of -CN species with the surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species on the catalyst. While for Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, N2O is formed due to the easier reaction of -CN with NOx. At high temperature, the catalyst mechanically mixed with Rh/LAx increased the concentration of Oads, which promoted CH4 oxidation and inhibited the reaction of NO with C-containing compounds to isocyanate (NCO*), thus reducing NH3 formation. Our work may provide new ideas for developing advanced TWC for NGVs with lower emission of NH3 and N2O.

Introduction Heavy-duty natural gas engines have become a very promising alternative fuel for automobiles due to low overall exhaust emissions [1,2]. However, in addition to pollutants such as CH4, CO and NOx, the elimination of NO will form NH3 and N2O. N2O is considered to be a potential contributor to the formation of the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation and depleting the ozone layer [3]. NH3 is an important substance in the formation of PM2.5 [4]. In addition to the impact on the environment, two gasses can have significant impact on human health. NH3 and N2O are strictly regulated in the Euro VI and Euro VII emission standards based on the requirements of the dual carbon target [5,6]. Therefore it is important to effectively improve the N2 selectivity of stoichiometric natural gas engine emissions. The formation of NH3 and N2O by NO reduction in modern commercial TWC is mainly influenced by catalyst composition, catalyst aging, λ, feed gas composition and reaction temperature. In the actual operation of the TWC, λ is controlled by switching between rich and lean periods near stoichiometric conditions to minimize NO reduction and oxidation of partially burned and unburned fuel. Yunkun Zhao et al. [7]. reported that the formation of NH3 increases significantly with the decrease of λ in the TWC simulation of automobile exhaust gas operation. Among other things, a further increase in the duration of rich conditions also led to a significant increase in NH3 formation. In addition, they also reported an increase in the concentration of NH3 and N2O formation with the decrease in oxygen storage capacity (OSC) caused by thermal aging of TWC. Toops et al. [8]. reported the formation of NH3 on Pd-based TWC (HPGM), Pd/Rh-based TWC (LPGM), a combination of a HPGM and a LPGM (Dual-Zone) catalyst, and a lean NO trap (LNT) catalyst in automobile exhausts. The steady-state NH3 selectivity decreases in the following order: HPGM ≥ Dual-Zone>>LPGM ≈ LNT. Rh is more active in reducing NOx to N2 when oxygen is present in the feed gas. Rh forms atomically dispersed species or metal cluster morphologies depending on environmental conditions [9,10], while different morphological Rh species exhibit different selectivity in the catalytic process [11–13]. Atomically dispersed Rh has 100% selectivity for NH3, and the reaction of Rh clusters leads mainly to the formation of N2 [14]. In addition to this, the concentration of NH3 and NO formation is influenced by the composition of the raw gas containing H2, CO and HC [15]. NO is reduced to N2O by H2 or CO at low temperatures. At high temperatures, HC plays a major reducing role, and NO is reduced to NH3 by HC. Other researchers have reported that NO can also be reduced by CO to form NH3 in the presence of water [16–18]. In addition to the above studies reported on NH3 and N2O formation factors, Anke Schön [19] and Shen Puqing [20] et al. reported the reduction of NH3 formation by adding La0.67Fe0.83Cu0.17O3 chalcocite. They found that the La0.67Fe0.83Cu0.17O3 catalyst slowed down the reforming reaction, which produces the hydrogen gas responsible for the formation of NH3. Although some researchers have addressed the effect of individual reducers consisting of simulated exhaust on NH3 and N2O emissions [5,21–23]. However, the reactions carried out on the catalysts for the tail gas treatment of stoichiometric natural gas engines, which are interdependent and interrelated. The pathways and mechanisms of NH3 and N2O formation in the presence of all CH4/NO/CO/H2O/O2 components are not clear. Therefore, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the mechanism of NH3 and N2O formation in TWC. Combined with the literature analysis Rh clusters can improve N2 selectivity and reduce NH3 production. The method of forming Rh clusters include increasing the Rh loading and changing the calcining temperature. Considering the economic benefits, in this work explores the formation mechanism of nitro-containing substrates and NO activation with mechanically mixed catalysts of Rh/LA and Pt/CeO2 calcined at different temperatures. In situ DRIFTS elucidated that the main pathway of NO reduction is the reaction of nitrite/nitrate species formed by NO adsorbed on CeO2 with CH4. In addition, it was elucidated by O1s and in situ DRIFTS that the -CN species with Rh/LAx mechanical mixed catalysts preferentially react with NO2 to form N2O since NO2 reacts with cyanide groups faster than oxygen at low temperature stage. And at high temperatures, the catalyst mechanically mixed with Rh/LAx increased the concentration of Oads, which promoted CH4 oxidation and inhibited the reaction of NO with C-containing compounds to NCO*, thus reducing NH3 formation. Our work provides new ideas for practical applications of efficient stoichiometric NGVs emission control. Experimental The preparation of the catalysts has been reported in detail in our previous study. More details will be described in Supporting Information (SI). The structure and physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were characterized by BET, XRD, H2-TPR, CO- chemisorption absorption, XPS, CO adsorption IR, FT-IR. Details on characterization methods are presented in SI. In our previous study, the catalytic assessment of the reduction of stoichiometric conditioned NGVs was reported in detail [6]. More details are described in SI. Results and discussion The specific surface area and pore size were almost similar for all Rh/LA catalysts. The results show that the calcination temperature and mechanical mixing have little effect on the textural properties of catalysts. In addition, no diffraction peak corresponding to Rh and Pt species was detected on Rh/LAx series and Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts. This may be because Rh and Pt are highly dispersed on the support, or the grain size is too small to be detected by XRD. The above results are shown in Figs. S1, S2, S3 and Table S1. The elemental chemical state and surface composition of the Rh/LAx and Pt/Ce mechanical mixed catalysts were evaluated using XPS. Pt 4d spectra was used in this study because of the strong overlap between Pt 4f and Al 2p signal in the samples with high concentration of Al and small amounts of Pt. The three different deconvolution peaks of Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts are Pt0 of the surface metallic state (312.3–313.8 eV), PtO in the surface oxidation state (315.1–315.9 eV) and PtO2 in the surface oxidation state (318.7–318.8 eV), as shown in Fig. 1 a. In order to determine the relative concentrations of Pt0, PtO and PtO2, these three states of Pt was analyzed semi-quantitatively and relative area shares were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1b. The Ce 3d XPS spectrum results are shown in Fig. S5. The high concentration of Ce3+/Ce promoted redox transformation between Ce3+ and Ce4+ [24,25], which is beneficial for improving the catalytic activity. The results are similar to the H2-TPR (Fig. S4). The fitting peak-splitting results of the O 1s XPS spectra for the Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 (a). Bands labelled as α peak at 529.2–529.4 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen (Olat) bonded with the metal cation. The β peak at 531.5 eV is attributed to surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads), the content of which affects the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the catalysts [26–28]. The small γ peak at the highest binding energy of 533.6–534.1 eV is usually considered as the characteristic peak of surface –OH from adsorbed H2O species [29,30]. In general, the concentration of chemisorbed oxygen is consistent with the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies [31]. The ratios of Oads /Oall from the XPS was determined by fitting dividing the Oads peaks by the total peak area of O 1s as shown in Fig. 2(b). The order of Oads content on the catalyst surface was Pt/Ce < Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 < Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600, and the results indicate that the surface adsorbed oxygen was much more abundant on catalysts mechanically mixed with Rh/LAx than on Pt/Ce catalysts. Nevertheless, the ratios of Oads of the catalysts was inconsistent with the catalytic performance. This result indicated that the concentration of Oads was not the determine factor of the catalytic reaction [28]. To support the presence of Rh cluster species, the presence of Rh species on the catalyst was characterized by CO-probe molecular FTIR spectroscopy. The IR spectra of the CO probe molecules on Rh/LAx series and Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . On the Rh/LAx series catalysts, the IR spectra are mainly influenced by the CO stretching at 2012 cm−1 associated with the dispersed Rh(CO)2 species [16,32] and the linear binding of CO at 2084 cm−1 associated with the Rh cluster [33]. With the increase of Rh/LAx treatment temperature, the species associated with Rh clusters linearly bound to CO at 2084 cm−1 had stronger absorption. On the contrary, the tensile strength of CO related to dispersed Rh(CO)2 species decreased at 2012cm−1. The CO chemisorption of catalysts at room temperature was further proved, and the dispersion of noble metals on the catalyst was calculated according to equation (2-1). The results are listed in Table S2. The order of noble metal dispersion over Rh/LAx catalysts is Rh/ LA550 > Rh/LA600 > Rh/LA700, which also verified the above conclusion. Thus, the proportion of exposed dispersed Rh species becomes smaller as the treatment temperature increases. The infrared spectra of CO adsorption of Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts is shown in Fig. 3(b). For Pt/Ce catalysts, the band centered at 2064 cm−1 [34,35], overlapping to an extent with bands for gaseous CO, corresponds to linearly bounded CO species on metallic Pt0. The shoulder peak at 2099 cm−1 corresponds to the CO adsorption peak on Pt2+ [36]. The difference is that there is only one CO adsorbed (2088cm−1) on Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 catalyst, which is believed to be related to the overlapping peaks of Rh(CO) and Pt0-CO [37–39]. The Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalyst formed a wide and strong CO adsorption peak. A linear adsorption peak of CO bound to the Rhx is detected at 2070 cm−1 [14,33]. Among them, the shoulder (2015 cm−1 and 2100 cm−1) [40] on both sides of the main peak is attributed to Rh(CO)2 species formed on dispersed Rh species. In order to elucidate the pathways leading to the formation of N2O and NH3, in-situ DRIFTS were performed under stoichiometric CH4-NO-CO conditions at temperatures from 300°C to 550 °C. As shown in Fig. 4 , all catalysts exhibit different NO adsorption states in the low temperature phase, which may be relevant to conversion of NO and the formation of N2O at low temperature. The NO adsorption spectra of Pt/Ce catalysts at 300°C-420 °C are shown in Fig. 4a. The bands at 1158 cm−1, 1290 cm−1, 1458 cm−1 and 1536 cm−1 are assigned to nitrite species [37,41–43], while a weak band at 1216 cm−1 is assigned to bridging nitrate species [44], indicating that NO was mainly adsorbed on Pt/Ce catalyst in the form of nitrite at the initial stage of the reaction. With increasing the temperature from 300 °C to 420 °C, the intensity of bands related to nitrite species (1158 cm−1, 1290 cm−1, 1458 cm−1 and 1536 cm−1) decreases gradually. This may indicate that nitrite reacts with CH4 and/or CO in the temperature region (300 °C-420 °C) as the catalytic activity shows the conversion of NO increases obviously, and therefore this nitrite has been considered to be a key compound in determining the catalytic activity of NO. For Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, the bands at 1424 cm−1–1649 cm−1 are ascribed to nitrate between 300°C-480°C [45,46] as shown in Fig. 4b and c. The results showed that NO was mainly adsorbed in the form of nitrate on Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalyst at the initial stage of the reaction. The results are consistent with the NO adsorption DRIFTS results (Fig. S6). Nitrates can be formed by the interaction of NO or nitrite with Ce -based support and Pt, respectively [46,47]. First, for support containing Ce, the most possible pathway for the formation of NO3 − species on Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts is the surface oxidation of NO2 −: NO2 − + O*→NO3 −. The surface active O* species such as O- can be formed by the adsorption of O2 on Ce-containing support [43,48]. From the results of O1s (Fig. 2b) and O2-TPD (Fig. S7), an increase of Oads can be observed in the mechanically mixed catalyst with Rh/LAx. It is known that surface adsorbed oxygen species are more active in the rapid redox reactions than lattice oxygen species, therefore a large amounts of surface adsorbed oxygen species can help to accelerate the formation of nitrate species [27,31,49]. For nitrate formation, the presence of platinum is not necessary [46]. However, if present, the oxidation of NO can be promoted on the oxidized Pt to form NO2, which can react with the CeO2 to form nitrates. In addition, by dissociating the adsorbed O2, Pt can act as a conduit for O spillover onto the CeO2 surface, leading to the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. The surface cyanide and isocyanate species are observed in-situ spectroscopic, indicating that NO may react with CH4 or CO. It is evident that in addition to the nitrate substances adsorbed at lower band, the spectra also show the formation of adsorption bands of C- and N-containing substances at 2000 cm−1–2200 cm−1. Two weak bands at 2142 cm−1–2274 cm−1 and at 2030 cm−1–2142 cm−1 are assigned to overlapping bands of NCO* and adsorbed -CN species [6,50] at low-temperature region (300 °C-440 °C). A strong band around 2042 cm−1 is attributed to C=O [38,51] and a weak band at 2162 cm−1 is attributed to NCO* [37,52] at high temperature region (460 °C-550 °C). The adsorbed -CN species is reactive to NO, NO2 and O2, leading to the formation of N2 and N2O [50]. Specifically, for Pt/Ce catalysts, the formation of N2 and CO2 is due to the reaction of -CN substances preferentially with the Oads species on the catalyst. While for Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, N2O is formed by the reaction of -CN substance with O2 and NOx competitively. Dinyar et al. [52]. found that NO2 react faster with cyanide groups than oxygen, therefore the -CN substances preferentially react with NO2 to form N2O for these two catalysts. In addition, NCO* is also intermediates for the formation of N2O [53,54], which is formed by the reaction of adsorbed CO with nitrate , as shown by CO+NO in situ DRIFTS. The formed NCO* continues to react with NOx, eventually forming N2O, CO2 and CO. For the IR spectrum at 340 °C, the area integration of the NCO* and N2O overlapping peaks band from 2142 cm−1–2274 cm−1 is performed (Table S3), and the integrated area order was Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 > Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 > Pt/Ce. In addition, in the presence of CO/CH4 + NO + O2 mixture, a weak bands is observed in the high temperature for all catalysts, this band is assigned to NCO* species with the intensity order of Pt/Ce > Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 > Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600. NCO* has been used as the intermediate in the reaction of NO with CH4 or CO, as precursors of N2, NH3 and N2O [55]. NH3 is formed by hydrolysis of NCO * species [16]. Bands of C=O adsorbed on Pt or Rh are observed at high temperature for all catalysts. Among them, Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx series catalysts are attributed to Rh-CO band [38,39] at 2042 cm−1, and this Rh is present in concert with other Rh atoms. This band is attributed to CO adsorbed linearly on Rhx species by Yates et al. [33], suggesting that the intensity of C=O adsorption on Rh clusters more intensely than the dispersed Rh species. We refer to the adsorption and reaction energies of Pt and Rh for CH4 [56–59]. Generally, the adsorption and dissociation energy of Rh for CH4 is lower than that of Pt. CH4 preferentially adsorbs and dissociates on the Rh-based catalyst. In addition, O 1s results showed that the Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx catalyst increased the concentration of Oads, which promoted the oxidation of CH4 over Rh/LAx and inhibited the reaction of NO over Pt/Ce catalysts with C-containing compounds to NCO*, thus reducing the formation of NH3. To confirm the formation pathway of NCO*, the reaction of NO+CO and the reaction of NO+CH4 were studied by DRIFTS, respectively. After NO adsorption, the sample was exposed to CH4 as the reductant. The variation of the DRIFTS spectrum with temperature during the reduction with CH4 as shown in Fig. 5 . It is clear from the IR spectra displayed that with increasing sample temperature, the intensity of the bands attributed to monodentate nitrite decreases on the three catalysts. For Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, the intensity of the bands attributed to bridging nitrates also decreases with increasing temperature. These results show that the chemical structure of the active intermediate is proved to be nitrite on the Pt/Ce catalysts, while in the Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, two kinds of active intermediates existed: monodontic nitrite and bridge nitrite. With further increase of the reaction temperature, two broad peaks at 1210 cm−1–1422 cm−1 and 1422 cm−1–1640 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibrations of an adsorbed formate ions and an acetate species [52], respectively. While the peaks responsible for monodontic / nitrite and bridge nitrite species at 1158 cm−1, 1218 cm−1, 1480 cm−1 and 1534 cm−1 were no longer present. Three of the catalysts had different reaction temperatures, which may correspond to the initial conversion temperature of CH4 or NO. In particular, a significant change was noted at 1800 cm−1–2300 cm−1. Clearly, the IR spectra of TWC have distinct differences in the vibrational bands at 2040 cm−1. For the Pt/Ce catalyst, the shoulder peak at 2040 cm−1 can be assigned to the bipolar peaks C=O band [60]. Its intensity gradually decreases with the increase of temperature from 380°C to 550°C and is replaced by a gaseous adsorbed CO [61] on Pt at 1980 cm−1. In contrast, for Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, the bands observed at 2040 cm−1 are assigned to Rh-CO [38] with an intensity of Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 < Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600. The intensity of this band also decreases gradually with increasing temperature from 420°C to 550°C. The results of the reaction of NO with CH4 showed that CH4 was converted to a mixture of CO and CO2, with CO being the main product at higher temperatures [62]. Meanwhile, bands of NCO* are observed at 2162 cm−1 on Pt/Ce catalyst [63], while bands of NCO* are observed at 2162 cm−1 and 2224 cm−1 on Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts [6], with an intensity of Pt/Ce > Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 > Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600, in agreement with in situ DRIFTS results. This is consistent with earlier studies conducted in the reaction of CONO, where the presence of isocyanate reaction intermediates was also proposed for the reaction of HC-SCR [52]. In contrast, no bands concerning NCO* were observed for the infrared spectrum the reaction of NO+CO (Fig. S8), and the results suggest that NCO* is mainly an intermediate formed by the reaction of NO with CH4. We speculate that it may be due to the oxidation of CO by surface adsorbed oxygen on the support and the relatively weak competition for reduction of NO. To further verify the relationship of Rh clusters and Oads with the formation of NH3 and N2O, activity experiments were performed under simulated stoichiometric natural gas tail gas treatment conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 , the conversion trends of CH4 and NO were the same for all catalysts. Among them, there is no significant difference in the conversion of CH4 and NO for all catalysts below T50. However, compared with samples mainly containing dispersed Rh, samples mainly containing Rh clusters exhibit higher complete conversion performance at higher conversion temperatures. Most interestingly, the formation of NH3 started with the conversion of CH4 and NO, and significant differences were observed in the concentration of NH3 formed during the experiment. When Rh is not present in the catalyst, the highest amount of NH3 is formed, about 200 ppm. The samples containing mainly dispersed Rh with relatively less Oads showed a significant reduction in NH3 formation of about 25 ppm (Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550). The formation of NH3 was controlled below 10 ppm for the samples of Rh clusters (Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA700 (Fig. S9)). The above in situ DRIFTS results demonstrated that the high Oads concentration with Rh/LAx mechanically mixed catalysts enhanced the formation of nitrate species. In addition, the in situ DRIFTS of the NO+CO reaction shows that the bands of NCO* species gradually increase as the nitrate bands diminish. The results suggest that the formed nitrate reacts with CO to form NCO* species. Thus the trend of N2O formation is consistent with the intensity of NCO*. Based the above results, we proposed the mechanism of the N2O and NH3 formation on the PtRh catalyst: there are two pathways for the formation of N2O: -CN competes with NO2 and O2; NCO* reacts with nitrate. Both are influenced by the concentration of catalyst Oads, which speeds up the oxidation of NO at low temperatures. -CN species can compete with NO2 and O2 to form N2O, where NO2 reacts more rapidly with -CN species than oxygen. Thus, high concentrations of Oads promote the formation of N2O. And NCO* readily reacts with nitrate to form N2O. For NH3 formation, the high concentration of Oads promotes the oxidation of CH4 over Rh/LA, which inhibits the reaction of NO with C-containing compounds to NCO* over Pt/Ce-Rh/LAx catalysts, thus reducing NH3 formation. Conclusion In this research, the effects of Rh clusters and changes in Oads on the catalyst on the conversion mechanism of NO and the formation pathways and mechanisms of toxic substrates such as NH3 and N2O were elucidated. Mechanical mixing of the catalyst with Rh/LAx increased the concentration of surface Oads of the sample. The high concentration of Oads promotes the oxidation of NO to NO2, which then enhances the production of nitrate species. In situ DRIFTS elucidated that the main pathway of NO reduction is the reaction of nitrite/nitrate species formed by NO adsorbed on CeO2 with CH4. CH4 has the same conversion trend as NO, and with its conversion, NH3 is formed accordingly. Elucidation of NH3 and N2O formation mechanisms by in situ DRIFTS revealed that for Pt/Ce catalysts, the formation of N2 and CO2 is due to the preferential reaction of -CN species with the Oads species. While for Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, N2O is formed due to the reaction of cyanide with NOx, due to the faster reaction of NO2 with -CN species than oxygen. And at high temperatures, the catalyst mechanically mixed with Rh/LAx increased the concentration of Oads, which promoted CH4 oxidation and inhibited the reaction of NO with C-containing compounds to NCO*, thus reducing NH3 formation. Our work may provide new ideas for the stoichiometric control of NH3 and N2O emissions from NGVs. Appendix A.

        "dc:description": "The mechanism of the NO conversion to poisonous substrates, such as NH3 and N2O on a model Pt/CeO2+Rh/LA three-way catalyst (TWC) during the treatment of exhaust emission from natural gas vehicles (NGVs) was investigated. The in situ DRIFTS results showed that the main pathway of NO reduction is the reaction of nitrite/nitrate species formed by NO adsorbed on CeO2 with CH4. It was further elucidated by O1s and DRIFTS that the formation of N2O at low temperature is ascribed to competitive reactions of cyanide (-CN) species with O2 and NOx. Specifically, for Pt/Ce catalysts, N2 and CO2 are formed due to the preferential reaction of -CN species with the surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species on the catalyst. While for Pt/Ce-Rh/LA550 and Pt/Ce-Rh/LA600 catalysts, N2O is formed due to the easier reaction of -CN with NOx. At high temperature, the catalyst mechanically mixed with Rh/LAx increased the concentration of Oads, which promoted CH4 oxidation and inhibited the reaction of NO with C-containing compounds to isocyanate (NCO*), thus reducing NH3 formation. Our work may provide new ideas for developing advanced TWC for NGVs with lower emission of NH3 and N2O.",
