Chimica Inorganica, Chimica Fisica e Chimica dei materiali, Universita di Torino, Turin, (Italy) Summary The nature and stability of chromium species on the surface of CrO,. / ZrO^ catalysts (Cr content, 0.05 - 5 wt.%) have been investigated by means of ESR, IR and XPS spectroscopies. On samples heated in oxygen at 773 K or at 923 K, chromium is present on the surface as Cr^ (ESR) and Cr^ (IR and XPS). Experiments with the \"Cr isotope show that the species observed by ESR spectroscopy is a surface mononuclear chromyi complex in a square- pyramidal configuration. Surface chromates are demonstrated by IR spec- troscopy. In more concentrated samples, polynuclear chromium species, and/or Cr^ and Cr^ polychromates, are observed in addition to chromates and isolated Cr^ Upon reduction with CO or Hg at increasing temperatures, Cr^ is reduced to Cr111 (ESR and IR) even at ca. 383 K. On further reduction at higher temperatures (up to 623 K), Cr^ is also reduced to Cr11. Specifically, samples reduced at 623 K contain Cr111 and Cr11 in nearly equal amounts. The catalytic pattern of the CrO, /ZrOa system, examined in the terms of the chromium species, allows us to conclude that isolated Cr111 species, arising from the reduction of Cr^, are the active sites for Hg-Dg equilibration and propene hydrogenation. The role of Cr11, either isolated or as dimers, is ruled out in the case of CrO^ /ZrOg catalysts. The zirconia matrix stabilizes the Cr111 active species in surface sites of high coordinative unsaturation. Introduction The study of chromium-containing catalysts can be considered a case history in heterogeneous catalysis as a result of the substantial amount of *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \"Deceased August 7th, 1988. fDip. Chimica, Universita di Sassari, Italy. 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 24 work carried out on these systems [1-10]. The interest is justified by the importance of the catalyzed reactions (hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, polymerization) and by the possibility of investigating Cr-containing cata- lysts by a variety of physicochemical techniques. The existence and develop- ment of different tools for tackling the surface chemistry aspects of Cr-based systems is a promising basis for identification of the surface species, thereby linking heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis concepts. This paper reports results on CrO^ /ZrOg systems currently under investiga- tion in our laboratory, which were found to be active in the hydrogen-deu- terium equilibration reaction [II], in alkene hydrogenation [11,12] and in alkane dehydrogenation [12]. The present paper focuses on the nature of the active species present on CrO^/ZrOa catalysts, and illustrates how the com- bined efforts of chemical, and ESR and IR spectroscopic techniques give a reasonable picture of the surface complexes intervening in the catalytic process. In this regard, the zirconia support plays a fundamental role because it stabilizes unusual valence states and gives rise to complexes which can be compared to those found on different supports. Experimental Catalysts The zirconia support was prepared from a hydrous zirconium oxide obtained by the hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride, dried at 383 K and used as such or after calcination at 673 or 923 K. These three starting materials are labelled Z(110), Z(400) and Z(650), respectively. Catalysts of different Cr content were prepared by placing the zirconia matrix in contact with chromium trioxide solutions of various concentrations at pH = 1. CrO^/ZrOg catalysts are designated as ZC followed by a figure giving the approximate Cr content (wt.%) and, in brackets, the type of Z used. Letters A and B refer to distinct preparations. Specimens with chromium content in the range 0.05 to ca. 5 wt.% are examined here. Surface areas ranged from 180 to 30m2g-l, depending on the treatment temperature of zirconia and on the chromium content. A list of catalysts and their properties is reported elsewhere [II], to which the specimen ZC2(400)B, Cr(wt.%) =1.60, SA^Hnr'g-1 should be added. Procedure All samples were treated in oxygen at 773 K or 923 K, and successively evacuated at room temperature (RT) or at 383 K before being used. This treatment is designated hereafter as oxT - evT where T specifies the tempera- ture (T/K) of oxygen heating and evacuation, respectively. Samples were successively reduced with CO and evacuated at various temperatures T, a treatment designated as redT - evT. Back-oxidation in oxygen of the reduced catalysts was also performed, reox(Oa)T - evT, at different temperatures. In some cases, reduced catalysts were successively heated with water vapour 26 and thereafter evacuated at various temperatures. These treatments, which are known to oxidize Cr11 to Cr111 [13], are designated reox(H20)T-evT. During the initial heating in oxygen (first stage of the ox773-ev383 treatment), an increase of pressure due to oxygen release (MS analysis) was observed. Its extent was significant and reproducible, and was therefore indicative of a decrease in the initial oxidation state of chromium. The CO used up and the COa formed during redT - evT, the hydrogen evolved during reox(H20)T- evT and the oxygen consumption during reox(02)-evT were monitored by means of a pressure transducer (MKS Baratron; sensitivity, 10~3 Torr). All these measurements allowed the variation of the average oxidation number of chromium, n, to be followed after each reducing or oxidizing treatment. The acquisition (+) or loss ( ) of electrons are ex- pressed as e/Cr = (number of electrons)/(total number of Cr atoms). Spectroscopic measurements (ESR, IR, XPS) were carried out on ZC cata- lysts exposed to the same, controlled redox treatments listed above. ESR Spectroscopic measurements at 77 K or at RT were carried out on a Varian E9 spectrometer equipped with an on-line Apple II computer [14]. IR spectra were run on an FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 1760), resolution 2 cm\"1. The XPS spectra were obtained with a Leybold Heraeus LHS 10 spectrometer, which allowed either treatment in situ or analysis of specimens specially prepared on a vacuum line without exposure to air. Results and discussion Characterization by ESR and XPS spectroscopies, and by redox cycles Oxidized samples. With ZC(400) and ZC(650) catalysts heated in oxygen up to 1023 K, a strong axial signal (g^ = 1.960, g^ = 1.979) was the only species detected by ESR spectroscopy (y-signal). In ZC(llO) samples, a signal with lines at g^ = 5.37 and g^ = 1.40, assigned to Cr1\" ions in a solid solution of tetragonal zirconia, was also observed. Its intensity was always weak and virtually unaffected by redox cycles. For this reason, this signal will not be considered further in the present paper. The y-signal was the same as previously observed on other supports and attributed to Cr^ [15-18]. By using a ZC0.05(110) catalyst prepared with 98.6% enriched \"Cr, a well-re- solved hyperfine structure could be observed which clearly demonstrated interaction of the unpaired electron with one \"Cr nucleus (I = 3/2). The same hyperfine pattern, but less resolved, was also observed in more concentrated samples (ZCl containing ^Cr). This species is located on the surface as shown by its reversible broadening upon exposure to oxygen at RT. As far as the surface configuration of C^ on ZrOg is concerned, it is remarkable that its ESR parameters are rather similar to those of CrOFg2\" and CrOClg2\", which are known to be square-pyramidal complexes [19]. Moreover, the Spectroscopic parameters of CJ^ are in good agreement with those calculated according to the model proposed by Garner et al. [20] for this type of complex. 26 Hence, the y -signal observed on ZC samples is assigned to a surface mononu- clear chrornyl species in a square-pyramidal configuration. The maximum concentration of C^ was observed after the ox773 - ev383 treatment, and corresponded to 40 - 50 atom% of the total chromium in the diluted samples ZC0.05(110) and ZC0.3(110), and decreased down to about 7% in the most concentrated samples. However, since (i) Cr^ clusters escape E8R detection, and (ii) the dependence of the C^ intensity on concentration is the one expected on statistical grounds (paired Cr^ species are not observable and trimers, if present, are at low concentration), it can be concluded that 40 to 50% was the nearly constant percentage of C^ in all ZC samples heated at 773 K. In particular, in the most concentrated samples, 7% of the total chromium was isolated C^ whereas the remaining 33 to 43% was clustered (C^ at least in pairs). It is noted that the Cr^ percentage was substantially higher than that observed for chromia/alumina [15] or chromia/silica [16]. It is further noted that on SiOg a second signal due to Cr\" in a tetrahedral configuration was also observed [16]. XPS analysis of ox773 - ev383 samples showed that Cr^ and traces of Cr\"1 were present. The peak of Cr^ was, however, wider than the one observed before oxygen treatment and may disguise C^ as shown by curve- fitting procedures. Passing to the chemical titrations, oxygen evolved during the ox773 - ev383 treatment was equivalent to e/Cr = 0.5. The oxidation state of chromium in all ZC catalysts prior to heating in oxygen was VI, on XPS evidence. Hence, the calculation gives n = 5.5 for all ZC samples heated in oxygen at 773 K. Reduced catalysts. Upon reduction with CO at increasing temperatures up to 623 K, the intensity of the Cr^ signal progressively decreased. For example, with the ZC0.5(650) sample the intensity of the ESR signal after reduction at 423 K was reduced to 16% of its initial value at e/Cr = 0.7, and to 5% at e/Cr =1.7. The signal was absent after the maximum extent of reduction at 623 K (e/Cr =3.0). The data clearly show that in the initial stages of reduction Cr^ species, unlike Cr^, are preferentially reduced at lower temperatures. On ZC samples reduced with CO at 623 K, a very broad (Aff a; 3000 G) and asymmetric line centred at g ^ 2.4 was observed at RT (<5-signal). The signal changed somewhat when recorded at 77 K and its intensity did not follow the Curie law. An assignment is difficult on spectroscopic arguments only; however the fact that (i) the species is formed under reducing condi- tions, (ii) the signal is absent on pure ZrOg treated in the same way, and (iii) other chromium-reduced species, Cr11 and Cr^, are not detectable by ESR spectroscopy at RT, strongly suggest that Cr111 species are involved. These ions are on the surface as indicated by their sensitivity to treatment with gases. Recalling that fully isolated Cr111 surface ions are most probably not detectable by ESR spectroscopy because of local symmetry variability, which causes strong variations of the zero-field terms, the ^-signal is assigned to Cr111 surface ions weakly coupled by dipolar and exchange interactions. 27 XPS spectra of reduced ZC samples (CO, 623 K either in situ or in the redox apparatus) clearly showed the presence of Cr111. The presence of Cr11 was compatible but not conclusive with the spectrum. Upon reduction with CO at increasing temperatures up to 623 K, the average oxidation state of chromium progressively decreased from n = 5.5 to 2.5. When Hg, instead of CO, was used as a reducing agent, the same maximum extent of reduction was found (c/Cr = 3.0). Samples reacted with water. By reacting ZC samples, previously reduced to the maximum extent, with HgO at various temperatures up to 973 K, a symmetrical and broad line, the /?-signal, appeared in addition to the S -signal which remained unaffected. The ^-signal (g ^ 2.0, A^f s: 1500 G) is assigned to clustered surface Cr111 ions (bidimensional clusters) arising from the oxida- tion of Cr11 with HgO [13]. The two ESR signals from Cr111 species, /? and 8, are different not only as far as their shapes and ESR parameters are concerned, but also for the depen- dence of their intensities on the temperature at which the ESR spectra were recorded. The data show that exchange interactions among Or\"1 ions are stronger in the case of the ^-species than the 8 ones, and point to a magnetically more concentrated Cr111 system in the case of the jS-species. When the treatment with water was performed at higher temperatures (^1023 K) the ESR signal of segregated a-Cr^Oy was observed. Passing now to the chemical titrations, ZC samples reduced to the maximum extent (n = 2.5) upon reaction with HgO at 973 K produced hydro- gen in an amount equivalent to e/Cr=0.5. Hence, the average oxidation state increased to n = 3.0. Reoxidation of reduced catalysts with oxygen. The oxidation of a ZC0.5(650) sample previously reduced to the maximum extent was performed by step-wise addition of oxygen at RT. After each addition, corresponding to ca. e/Cr=0.1, ESR spectra were taken to follow the increase of the Cr^ signal. The results show that (i) at e/Cr = 0.7 (n = 3.2) the initial intensity of Cr^, i.e. that measured after ox773 - ev383 treatment, showed only 10% recovery, and (ii) at e/Cr = 2.2 (n = 4.7) the percentage of C^ recovered was 26%. After the latter treatment, no further adsorption took place upon subse- quent addition of Og at RT and, accordingly, no further increase in the Cr^ signal was observed. However, when the same sample was submitted to the reox(02)773 - ev383 treatment, the Cr^ intensity was restored to its initial value reversibly. Returning to the Cr111 <5-signal, quantitative assessments on its variation were more difficult because of the unfavourable spectroscopic fea- tures (very broad ESR signal). However, a decrease ofco. 30% in signal inten- sity was observed upon exposure of ZC samples previously reduced at 623 K to Oz at RT and hence showing the Or1\" 5-signal at their maximum intensity. The signal was reversibly destroyed after the reox(0a)773 - ev383 treatment. The results reported above, taken along with those obtained after reduction, strongly suggest that Cr111-^ is the reduction product of Cr^ 28 With respect to average oxidation states, n values increased upon back-oxidation with oxygen. At RT, n increased from 2.5 to 4.7. Full re- versibility (n = 5.5) was obtained after the reox( 02)773 - ev383 treatment. Characterization by IR spectroscopy Oxidized samples. The IR spectrum of the ZC2(400) sample after ox923 - evRT treatment is characterized by the presence of two groups of bands [Fig. 1, spectrum (a)]. The higher frequency group consists of three sharp bands at 1030, 1018 (stronger band) and ca. 1004 (shoulder) cm\"1. The lower frequency group consists of three broad bands at 920, 889 and 865 cm\"1, respectively. On introduction of CO at RT, a sharp band at 2191 cm\"! is observed [Fig. 2, spectrum (a)]. This is the same band as previously reported for pure ZrOa and assigned to CO weakly (T-bonded to W surface ions [21]. Reduced catalysts. Upon reduction with CO at increasing temperatures (from RT to 623 K), the intensities of all bands in the 1100 - 840 cm-1 region progressively decrease [Fig. 1, spectra (b-d)]. Specifically, bands at 1018, 1004, 920, 889 and 865 cm-1 are strongly reduced in intensity after reduction at 373 K, and virtually absent after the red423 - ev423 treatment. After this latter treatment, a doublet, 1030 and 1010 cm-1, and a very broad absorption at v < 900 cm-1 are the only bands persisting in this spectral region. Traces of these absorptions are still present after reduction at 523 K but disappear at 623 K. Upon introduction of CO to the reduced catalysts, several carbonyl bands are observed in the 2250 -1900 cm-1 region of the spectrum. Their intensity and nature are found to depend markedly on the extent of catalyst reduction [Fig. 2, spectra (b) and (c)]. Specifically, a band at 2193cm-! is the only 1000 950 en -i Fig. 1.

Its intensity increases with increasing reduction temperature up to 423 K, and remains constant thereafter or decreases slightly. With more extensively reduced samples (at or above 523 K), bands at 2150-2070 and at 1990- 1760 cm\"1 are observed in addition to that at 2193 - 2187 cm\"1. Samples reacted with water. A ZC2(400) sample, previously reduced with CO by red623 - ev623 treatment, was successively reacted with HgO. After reox(H20)623 - ev723 treatment, the band at 2187 cm\"! (but now nearly 1.5- times more intense than previously) is the only band persisting in the IR spectrum. Reoxidation with oxygen. Reoxidation of the red623 - ev623 catalyst was performed by step-wise addition of Og at RT. After each oxygen addition, IR spectra were taken. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 for the spectral region 1130- 840 cm\"1. Upon addition of doses equivalent to e/ Cr ^ 1 [Fig. 3, spectra (a) and (b)], the doublet (1030,1010 cm-1) and the broad absorption starting at 900 cm-1 are recovered. Upon subsequent addi- tion of oxygen at RT [Fig. 3, spectrum (c)], the band at 1018 cm-1 and the three broad bands at lower frequency (920, 889 and 865 cm-i) are also recovered but only to a limited extent. Heating in oxygen at 773 K nearly restores the situation observed after the ox923 - evRT treatment. Complete reversibility is observed after the reox( 02)923 - evRT treatment [Fig. 3, spec- trum (d). Compare with spectrum (a) of Fig. 1]. Considering now the 2250-1750 cm-i region of the spectrum (spectra not reported for the sake of brevity), adsorption of CO at RT on the same sample treated with oxygen, as described above, shows a preferential de- crease of all bands at v < 2150 cm-1. 30 Fig. 3.

Assignment of the various bands is made possible by mainly relying on the extensive IR literature dealing with chromium-containing systems. Bands in the carbonyl region are considered first. In particular, the bands at 2193 - 2187 cm\"1 are assigned to a -bonded linear carbonyls, the ones at 2150-2070cm\"1 to a, it-bonded linear carbonyls, and all the others at v < 2000 cm\"1 to bridged carbonyls. As far as the oxidation state of chromium is concerned, the band at 2145 - 2189 cm~1 involves Cr\"1 ions [22]. All other bands involve Cr11 ions [23]; the latter species, in fact, being richer in d-electrons are capable of effective back-donation, thus accounting for lower stretching frequencies. The involvement of Cr\" is also suggested by the formation of bridged carbonyls which are, in fact, favoured by lower oxida- tion states. The bands in the 1130 - 830 cm~1 region are considered next. The fre- quencies and sharpness of the bands at 1030, 1010, 1016 and 1004 cm-1 are typical of chromium-oxygen groups having a large double-bond character [24 - 27]. The frequencies and broadness of bands at v < 950 cm~1 are typical of chromium-oxygen groups of a lower double-bond character and of Cr 0 Cr groups (asymmetric stretching only) [24 - 27]. Accordingly, the sharp and intense band at 1018cm\"1 and the shoulder at 1004cm\"1 are assigned to Cr==0 species on the basis of their position and half-width. The oxidation state of chromium cannot be assessed on IR evidence alone, the latter being consistent with either Cr^ or Cr^. However, strict analogies are found when the behaviour of this band is compared with that of the ESR signal of the C^ species, i.e. a close parallelism is observed between the intensities of the two signals through the various stages of the redox cycles. Hence, the IR band at 1018 cm~1 and the shoulder at 1004 cm~1 are assigned to ==0 species, isolated or not. The similar parallelism found for the group 31 of the three bands at 920, 889 and 865cm\"1 strongly suggests polynuclear surface species of Cr^ and/or possibly polychromate species of mixed valence (V,VI). Finally, the doublet at 1030 and 1010 cm 1 is assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes, respectively, of surface chromates. The related broad band starting at 900 cm\"1 can be interpreted as due to the blue shift of the Zr 0 Cr modes caused by Cr oxidation. Chromium surface species Chromium species formed on the zirconia surface after the various treatments along with the identification method are reported in Table 1. Two redox couples, to some extent independent of each other, are identified on the surface of ZC catalysts: Cr^Cr1\" and Cr^/Cr\". The full reversibility of the two couples and the low nuclearity of the chromium species (as demonstrated by ESR and IR spectroscopies) point to well-dispersed chromium. Strong interaction of chromium with the zirconia matrix prevents its segregation as a-Cra03. In particular, oxidized ZC catalysts contain isolated C^ ions, surface chromates(VI) and, especially in more concentrated samples, polynu- clear chromium species, polychromates(VI), polychromates(V) and possibly polychromates of mixed valence (VI and V). Since n = 5.5, Cr^ and C^ are present in nearly equal amounts. Upon reduction with CO, isolated Cr111 species are formed from C^ in the early stages of reduction at lower temperatures. As reduction proceeds, Cr11 ions are also formed from Cr^. In the latter situation, Ci^-Cr111 and C^-Cr11 species appear in addition to isolated Cr11 and Cr111 species. On fully reduced samples, since n = 2.5, Or1\" and Cr11 are formed in nearly equal amounts. Finally, the redox potential and the chemical stability of chromium species justify the observed ease of reduction of Cr\" to Cr\"1 along with the difficulty of the reverse process, as well as the observed difficulty of the reduction of Cr^ to Cr11 along with the ease of the reverse process. Catalytic activity of chromium surface species An initial suggestion regarding the nature of the sites active for Hg-Dg equilibration and for propene hydrogenation has been reported previously [11]. It is now possible to have a better insight into the nature of Cr-containing TABLEl Chromium species on the surface of CrO, /ZrO; catalysts Treatment ESR IR XPS Redox cycles (in the sequence) spectroscopy spectroscopy spectroscopy n Species oxidized Cr\" Cr\", Cr^ Cr^Cr^ 5.5 (Cr^, Cr^ reduced C^-S Or\"1, Or\" Ci^.CCr\") 2.5 (Cr , Or\") reacted with H^O C^-S, CJ^-P Or1\" Cr 1 3.0 (Cr111) 32 surface complexes, and to specify features required for the catalytic process. As a necessary background, essential points of the catalytic pattern found for the CrO^/ZrOz system are first recalled. For both the reactions mentioned above, the catalytic activity, N, ex- pressed as turnover frequency per total Cr atoms (N/molecules reacted s~1 atom\"1) exhibits the following features: (i) it increases markedly with in- creasing reduction up to e/Cr = 2 (n about 3.5), and thereafter remains constant or decreases slightly; (ii) it is virtually unaffected in samples previously reduced with CO or Hz (thereby having a high catalytic activity) on heating with water vapour up to 873 K; (iii) it is unaffected when oxygen is added step-wise at RT on reduced samples (n = 2.5) up to n about 3.5; and (iv) it decreases sharply upon subsequent addition of oxygen causing n to increase above 3.5. The above features point strongly to Cr111 as an essential constituent of the active centres. Consideration of the E8R and IR results show that mononuclear Cr111 species are preferentially formed in the early stages of catalyst reduction, and their formation parallels the sharp increase of cata- lytic activity [point (i) above]. Constant, or slightly decreasing, activity is observed in the e/Cr range where the Cr111 concentration has already reached its maximum. Point (ii) leads to the conclusion that Cr11 on zirconia is much less active than Cr111, if at all. Its involvement in the catalytic process, either alone or in combination with Cr111, would have implied a decrease in the activity of samples treated at higher temperature with water vapour. The same conclusion is supported by points (iii) and (iv) above, since preferential oxidation of Cr11 is shown by the IR spectroscopic results. Having now focused attention on Cr111 as a key species for catalysis, several findings indicate that not all Cr111 species are equally active. Let us consider the water vapour treatment at high temperature. This process increases the Cr111 concentration, as witnessed by the oxidation of Cr11 and by the increase of the IR bands linked to the presence of Cr111. No increase of the catalytic activity is found, however. The ESR spectrum clarifies that the Cr111 species formed, called Cr\"1-^, is distinct from Cr -^ identified on reduced specimens and originating from Cr^. On the other hand, Cr111-^ is not necessarily an identification tag for the active species. Indeed, Cr111 is formed in the early stages of reduction, when IR spectra clearly show its formation and catalysis registers a marked increase of activity. Yet, due to spectroscopic reasons, no isolated Cr111 can be seen, because a weak interaction is required. Hence, no simple correlation with the 6 -species can be expected, although the last species clarifies that either non-interacting or weakly interacting centres can be catalytically active. In conclusion, isolated (as seen by IR spectroscopy) or weakly interact- ing (as seen by IR and ESR spectroscopies) Cr111 species can be identified as the essential constituent of the active centre. Attention is drawn therefore not merely to the oxidation state of Cr, the 3+ being the favoured identified state, but also to its coordination. It is likely that more than one coordinative vacancy is required, and hence that not all Cr111 species are active centres. 33 References 1 R. L. Burwell, G. L. Haller, K. C. Taylor and J. F.

On samples heated in oxygen at 773 K or at 923 K, chromium is present on the surface as CrV (ESR) and CrVI (IR and XPS). Experiments with the 53Cr isotope show that the species observed by ESR spectroscopy is a surface mononuclear chromyl complex in a square-pyramidal configuration. Surface chromates are demonstrated by IR spectroscopy. In more concentrated samples, polynuclear chromium species, and/or CrVI and CrV polychromates, are observed in addition to chromates and isolated CrV Upon reduction with CO or H2 at increasing temperatures, CrV is reduced to CrIII (ESR and IR) even at ca. 383 K. On further reduction at higher temperatures (up to 623 K), CrVI is also reduced to CrII. Specifically, samples reduced at 623 K contain CrIII and CrII in nearly equal amounts. The catalytic pattern of the CrO x /ZrO2 system, examined in the terms of the chromium species, allows us to conclude that isolated CrIII species, arising from the reduction of CrV, are the active sites for H2-D2 equilibration and propene hydrogenation. The role of CrII, either isolated or as dimers, is ruled out in the case of CrO x /ZrO2 catalysts. The zirconia matrix stabilizes the CrIII active species in surface sites of high coordinative unsaturation. References 1 R.L. Burwell G.L. Haller K.C. Taylor J.F. Read Adv. Catal. 20 1969 1 2 A.
