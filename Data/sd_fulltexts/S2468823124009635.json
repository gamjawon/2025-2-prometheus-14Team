Commercializing a catalyst developed in the laboratory is the aspiration of every catalyst researcher, but this step is highly challenging. This Perspective outlines the basic engineering criteria for developing next-generation catalysts capable of meeting the increasing global demand for renewable, carbon-free ammonia (NH3). A range of key technical and economic factors, extending from active site-scale considerations to process-scale viewpoints are presented. These are operation conditions, activity, long-term stability, formability, and marketability, and their quantitative criteria are proposed to ensure the practicality of the catalyst product. By addressing these interconnected criteria, this Perspective aims to bridge the gap between innovation in laboratory and industrial application, paving the way for a valuable future in catalyst research and development.

Introduction Driven by the global demand for decarbonization and the distribution of renewable energy, research on ammonia (NH3) synthesis is entering a new era. There is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of existing NH3 production facilities. Additionally, it is desired to achieve green and carbon-free NH3 production in long-term [1]. The mature Natural Gas-fed Haber-Bosch (NG-HB) process has been the industry standard for more than several decades due to its low energy intensity of up to 28 GJ tonNH3 −1 [2,3]. However, the emerging demand for NH3 synthesis processes combined with electrolysis-derived hydrogen (i.e. green H2) requires the development of Advanced Haber-Bosch (Adv-HB) processes [4]. This goal is accelerating the research interest in the development of next-generation catalysts that can operate under milder conditions [5,6]. In this context, the development of novel NH3 synthesis catalysts with superior activity compared to industrial catalysts under mild conditions has been actively discussed recently. These efforts often include the exploration of new catalyst compositions by introducing innovative materials [5–16], or the structural optimization of known catalysts by uncovering new catalytic phenomena [17,18]. These efforts have not only improved our understanding of catalysis, but have also led to tremendous advances in the synthetic strategy of new catalytic materials. Despite these advances, the commercialization of state-of-the-art catalysts requires careful navigation of numerous intertwined technical and economic factors. Successful commercialization of newly developed catalyst is an exciting but complex task, as it must satisfy multiple stakeholders including catalyst manufacturers, Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) companies, and end users of the target catalytic process. This Perspective aims to outline the basic engineering criteria that should be proactively considered when developing advanced NH3 synthesis catalysts. Considering factors from the active site-scale to process-scale, a range of core values are discussed with the quantitative criteria. In particular, this work presents diverse viewpoints for researchers and business associates who aim to commercialize novel catalysts beyond academic interest. Criterion 1. Operation conditions Before navigating the catalyst properties, it is essential to establish the required temperature and pressure conditions for the target process to ensure energetic feasibility. In the conventional Haber-Bosch process, compression is known to be the most energy-intensive factor [3]. As such, low-pressure operation is often considered a key strategy for process intensification. However, NH3 synthesis is an exothermic reaction with decreasing entropy, thermodynamic limitations inherently necessitate low-temperature operation along with low-pressure conditions (Fig. 1 a). This creates a dilemma in process operation, as the reaction kinetics are significantly hindered under these mild conditions, making it difficult to achieve high NH3 yields. So, what specific reaction conditions are required to make advanced processes both energetically and economically competitive compared to existing technologies? This question becomes more complex when considering the overall process configuration of NH3 synthesis. Fundamentally, the concentration of NH3 at the reactor outlet (c NH3), rather than the reaction temperature or pressure alone, is the primary determinant of overall process efficiency. To better understand this, a simplified process flow diagram for NH3 synthesis using green H2 (Adv-HB) is illustrated in Fig. 1b. When NH3 is produced, it must be separated and recovered from the gas mixture in the product stream. Currently, refrigeration separation has been exclusively adopted in industrial NH3 synthesis plants due to its economic feasibility compared to other methods. In the refrigeration separation unit, the recovery efficiency of NH3 is determined by the gas-liquid phase equilibrium of NH3, which depends on c NH3. When c NH3 is low, more energy is required in the second heat exchanger (Step H.E.2) to further cool the reactor outlet stream. Moreover, a lower c NH3 increases energy consumption for recompression (Step C2) due to the larger quantity of recycle stream. Hence, a simple low-pressure or low-temperature Haber-Bosch process is often disadvantageous in reducing energy consumption if c NH3 is low. It is therefore imperative that the Adv-HB process achieves a sufficiently high c NH3 to ensure energy efficiency and process viability. The NG-HB process typically operates at 723–773 K and 15–20 MPa, achieving a single-pass feed conversion of about 25 % [19], or c NH3 ≈ 14 %. As depicted in Fig. 1a, a very narrow operating temperature envelope (< 473 K) is possible at a relatively low pressure of 0.1 MPa. A few reports have suggested the potential for ammonia synthesis under these drastically mild conditions [6]. However, the demonstration of such high levels of c NH3 (e.g. ≥ 14 %) has been rarely documented thus far. The temperature envelope can be widened as the operation pressure increases. With this regard, the intermediate temperature and pressure conditions, e.g. 673 K and 5 MPa, seem more realistic and achievable in the short term to meet the global demand for green NH3 production. In NH3 synthesis, H2/N2 is another critical factor influencing reaction performance. While the stoichiometric H2/N2 ratio of 3/1 is thermodynamically optimal, our calculation reveals that the thermodynamic maximum c NH3 remains relatively constant (i.e. 14.1–15.5 %) over a wide H2/N2 range of 1.63–5.67 at 673 K and 5 MPa (Fig. 1c). However, the optimum H2/N2 varies with catalyst type as well as operating conditions such as temperature and pressure. Even catalysts with identical compositions may have different optimum H2/N2 ratios due to differences in preparation methods [20]. For instance, Ru- and CoMo-based catalysts often exhibit optimum H2/N2 ratios below 3 [20–22], favoring N2-rich conditions. This is attributed to the rate-determining step (RDS), where N2 activation plays a dominant role. In particular, Ru is notoriously susceptible to hydrogen poisoning, driving ongoing efforts to develop materials that overcome this limitation. These identifications demonstrate that the stoichiometric H2/N2 ratio does not necessarily maximize reaction performance (i.e. catalytic activity or NH3 yield) due to the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics (Fig. 1d). Some recently reported catalysts (e.g. Ru/C12A7:e − [5], Fe/BaCeO3− x N y H z [8], Co/BaCeO3− x N y H z [8], Re/Mo2CT x [9]) show a higher reaction order for H2 than for N2, necessitating further investigation of the optimal H2/N2 ratio regarding the rate-determining step. Nevertheless, conditions that significantly deviate from the stoichiometric H2/N2 ratio pose practical challenges. Operating NH3 synthesis under non-stoichiometric conditions inevitably leads to ‘unsteady state’ operation as a transient recycling stream mixed with fresh feeds (Fig. 1b). To address this issue, a system engineering approach has been proposed, showing a potential for steady-state operation under non-stoichiometric H2/N2 conditions in a multibed reactor [22]. Criterion 2. Activity Thus, what is the necessary activity of the catalyst for industrial application? Catalytic activity is usually the primary factor evaluated from the fundamental research stage, often expressed as the weight-time-yield (WTY) under the given reaction conditions, or as turnover frequency (TOF) after defining the active site. However, from an engineering perspective, the key factor in process design is the volume of catalyst required to produce NH3 that achieves the thermodynamic maximum under the given conditions. Therefore, the space-time-yield (STY) at high conversion may be the most appropriate indicator to consider. While the activities of state-of-the-art NH3 synthesis catalysts have been well-documented in several review articles [23–26], assessing their practical feasibility remains challenging, primarily due to two factors: (i) the lack of catalyst density information and (ii) the absence of high NH3 yield (e.g. c NH3) results. Catalyst density, often overlooked, has a crucial impact on STY. The characteristics of representative commercial NH3 synthesis catalysts are shown in Table 1 . Commercial Fe-based catalysts, despite their rather low WTY, demonstrate competitive STY due to their high density (> 2.6 g cm−3). In contrast, supported Ru catalysts typically exhibit high WTY but suffer from low densities primarily due to the porous support. For instance, the well-known Ba-Ru/Carbon Black catalyst has an extremely low density (< 0.2 g cm−3), resulting in a relatively low STY [28]. The highly porous domain—either the active component itself if no support is used, or the support component in the case of supported catalysts—is advantageous for enhancing the dispersion of active sites. However, increased catalyst porosity generally leads to a decrease in catalyst density, presenting a significant dilemma. To overcome this challenge, innovative catalytic materials with a balanced porosity and density are highly recommended. Due to the influences of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, catalytic activity varies significantly with space velocity at the given temperature and pressure (Fig. 2 a). High yield NH3 production necessarily requires the catalyst to operation at relatively low space velocities. Although the catalytic activity in the kinetic-controlled region is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism over the catalyst, the catalytic activity may exhibit reduced value as thermodynamic constraints increase. Therefore, it is important to experimentally determine the catalytic activity within the practical operating conditions. Taking these complexities into account, we can deduce the following criterion to determine the practical potential of a catalyst. First, the STY of NH3 over the catalyst can be expressed as in Eq. (1) [28]: (1) S T Y = c N H 3 1 + c N H 3 × M w N H 3 × G H S V 22400 where Mw NH3 is the molecular weight of NH3 (i.e. 17 g mol−1), GHSV is the gas hourly space velocity (i.e. the inlet gas flow rate at STP per volume of catalyst), and 22,400 comes from the molar volume in cm3 of an ideal gas at STP. The relationship between the required catalytic activity (STY) and target GHSV to achieve target c NH3 is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The energy efficiency of the process is proportional to c NH3, and operation at high space velocities is economically advantageous because it reduces capital costs by minimizing reactor size and catalyst loading. As mentioned in Criterion 1, the c NH3 required for industrial application is about ≥ 14 %, and the existing Haber-Bosch process typically operates at a GHSV of about 10,000 h−1. Therefore, to meet this target, the catalyst must achieve an STY ≥ 0.93 gNH3 cmcat. −3 h−1. Although this criterion may vary depending on the process configuration and a more detailed techno-economic assessment, it provides a concise and quantitative goal for catalyst developers to aim for. The STY of selected state-of-the-art catalysts and their measurement conditions are summarized in Fig. 3 . We specifically include examples where catalyst density, GHSV, and outlet NH3 concentration are clearly reported. According to Clariant's announcement, AmoMax 10, a widely used commercial catalyst, is able to demonstrate a c NH3 of about 7 to 8 % under conditions of 673 K, 5 MPa, and 15,000 h−1. Among academic studies, Cs-Ru/SGCNT (Cs and Ru supported on super-growth carbon nanotubes [29]) shows a relatively high activity, surpassing the aforementioned activity criterion within a specific GHSV range (∼7000 h−1). Interestingly, this catalyst shares compositional similarities with the catalyst employed in the Kellogg Advanced Ammonia Process (KAAP), the low-pressure NH3 synthesis process. These observations again emphasize the technical superiority of the catalysts developed in the last century, which substantially met the technical requirements for commercialization. Criterion 3. Long-term stability Current NH3 synthesis plants have a long lifetime of typically over 2–5 decades [2]. Therefore, long-term stability of catalyst is a critical factor in process efficiency. Ideally, a catalyst should have a lifetime as long as possible to ensure that the capital costs are recovered. For example, KATALCO74–1, a representative commercial NH3 synthesis catalyst supplied by Johnson Matthey (Table 1), retains most of its initial activity (> 60 %) over 10 years. It is essential that thorough long-term stability assessment are conducted, even for newly developed catalysts. Some exemplary studies have reported assessments spanning several months [9]. In the context of green NH3 synthesis, additional considerations for potential risks are necessary. In regions where renewable energy supply is intermittent, unexpected process downtimes may frequently occur. In such cases, the reusability and repeatability of the catalyst become even more important. The catalyst must be tolerant of exposure to the ambient atmosphere or contaminants during these downtimes and should possess the ability to regenerate its original activity upon restart without requiring an expensive pretreatment. Furthermore, the effects of moisture and oxygen, which may not be fully removed during water electrolysis and air separation (Fig. 1b), are still veiled in state-of-the-art NH3 synthesis catalytic systems. While preventing these potential threats in the pre-reaction stages is ideal, the development of new materials tolerant to these contaminants could lead to innovations that reduce the energy and cost associated with feed purification steps. Criterion 4. Formability In actual operation, a shaped technical catalyst is used because catalyst powder can cause pipe clogging and, in severe cases, damage sensors and valves. Therefore, formability is an essential factor in catalyst development, and the criteria for activity and long-term stability must be applied to the shaped technical catalyst. However, catalyst forming is a very challenging task as it usually shows far different catalytic performances compared to when the catalyst is in powder form. Since NH3 synthesis require the activation of two chemically distinct molecules, N2 and H2, catalysts are often composed of multiple components, such as an active center and a promoter. As shown in Table 1, commercial Fe-based catalyst are composed of Fe and trace amount of other elements (e.g. Al, Ca, K, and Si). Ru-based catalyst are commonly promoted by addition of Ba and Cs [7,17,25,30,31]. Additionally, support often has a profound effect on activity [5,8,18,32,33]. The desired catalytic activity could be achieved through the optimized interfacial synergy between these components [7,17,18,33]. However, during the catalyst forming process, several additives such as binders, solvents, lubricants, or abrasives are added to the catalyst [34] (Fig. 4 ). In addition, heat treatment is usually applied to remove organic contaminants from the final product. In other words, even if a catalyst has optimal distribution of active sites in its powder form, these sites may be disturbed during the forming process due to chemical interaction with additives and structural reconstructions (Fig. 4). The effects of these additives on state-of-the-art catalysts are still not fully understood. For instance, clay, a typical inorganic binder, is primarily composed of acidic metal oxides such as SiO2 and Al2O3, however, it has been reported that Al2O3 can act as an inhibitor, reducing the activity of Ru-based catalysts by titrating the functionality of basic promoter [18]. Common alkali (e.g. Na, K, etc.) or alkaline earth metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, etc.) can also affect active sites, either as promoters or inhibitors. This is because basicity often empowers activity of NH3 synthesis catalysts, but excessive amounts of alkali-/alkaline earth metals can poison the active centers [17]. Heat treatment can also have a significant impact, as gasified organic additives (e.g. CO2, CO, H2O) may strongly adsorb onto the active site, and the heat itself can reconstruct the catalyst microstructure including phase transformation, particle aggregation or redistribution. To be summarized, catalyst designers must keep in mind that the forming process is an integral part of active site architecture. Another important factor for technical catalysts is their size. Even for self-stand shaped catalysts without any additives, catalytic activity may decrease compared to their powder form due to mass and heat transfer limitations. The influence of mass and heat transfer can be estimated by assessing Mears criterion and Weisz-Prater criterion. A recent study demonstrated that the upper limit for the radius of a spherical Ru-Ba/MgO catalyst pellet was approximately 6 mm to exclude mass transfer limitations [18]. It is also important to note that the higher the catalyst activity in STY, the smaller the required pellet size to avoid transfer limitations. Thus, these criteria should be rigorously investigated for other advanced catalysts. In turn, EPC companies consider the mechanical strength of the catalyst technical body as one of the top priorities during the catalyst selection stage. Crush strength is typically measured by methods such as ASTM D4179, D6175, and D7084, depending on the catalyst's shape (i.e. pellet, extrudate, and granule, respectively). Although not specifically defined, the criterion for crush strength can be established by considering the critical fracture point of individual catalyst bodies. Since fractures most often occur during the catalyst loading step, the impulsive force exerted on a catalyst pellet when it collides with the reactor bottom wall can be derived as follows (Eq. (2)): (2) F = I Δ t = m ˙ Δ v Δ t = m ˙ 2 g H Δ t where F is the impulsive force, I is the impulse, Δt is the collision time, ṁ is the mass of the individual pellet, Δv is the final velocity, g is the gravitational acceleration, and H is the reactor height. The impulsive force (F) as a function of Δt and ṁ falling from a reactor height (H) of 10 m is depicted in Fig. 5 . For example, if ṁ is 0.1 g and the Δt is approximately 0.001 s, then F is approximately 0.14 kgf. Thus, the individual pellet can be successfully loaded into the reactor without fracture if it has a crush strength greater than 0.14 kgf. Indeed, most commercial catalysts possess crush strengths greater than a few kgf. It should be noted that heavier catalyst pellets require higher crush strengths. Other factors, such as compressive strength and tensile strength, can also be considered as major indicators. Their criteria also should be established according to appropriate standards depending on the application, e.g. catalyst shape, reactor geometry, and impact conditions. Criterion 5. Marketability Beyond technical requirements, marketability is a crucial factor in the commercialization of catalyst products. Apart from product pricing, various aspects such as market demand and the availability of raw material supply must be considered. Currently, global NH3 demand is approximately 200 Mt yr−1, and it is projected to increase over 690 Mt yr−1 by 2050 under a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement [4]. The expansion of the NH3 market is projected to be driven by emerging industries, such as marine fuel, hydrogen carriers, and power generation, all of which are transitioning to renewable, decarbonized NH3. This anticipated market growth implies the need for establishment of over a few hundreds of new NH3 synthesis plants, and a corresponding increase in the demand for next-generation catalysts. So, what will the global demand for new NH3 synthesis catalysts look like? Assuming the catalyst is not replenished throughout the lifetime of a newly established plant, we can estimate the required amount of catalysts based on their activity. As suggested by Criterion 2, with a catalytic activity of 0.93 gNH3 cmcat. −3 h−1 and assuming the catalyst density is 1 g cm−3, the estimated amount of catalyst needed by 2050 is about 60 kt (Fig. 6 a). This indicates a substantial demand for new NH3 synthesis catalysts. The wide distribution potential of Ru-supported catalysts, which have gained significant attention in laboratory researches as next-generation candidates, must be critically evaluated in this context. Ru-supported catalysts generally contain 3–10 wt% Ru, implying that 1.8–6.0 kt of Ru would be needed for NH3 synthesis by 2050. Given that the global Ru supply is less than 40 t yr−1 now (Fig. 6b), and that Ru demand is not confined to the NH3 synthesis industry, the feasibility of scaling up Ru-supported catalysts is questionable. Other industries, such as electronics manufacturing and PEM fuel cells, are also increasing their demand for Ru [35], further complicating its availability. Therefore, even if a catalyst is technically superior, challenges in securing raw materials can severely hinder its commercial viability. For Ru-based catalysts, maximizing Ru efficiency and reducing its content is a prerequisite. Meanwhile, developing non-Ru NH3 synthesis catalysts with readily available elements, e.g. Fe [36], Co [13,28,37], Ni [12], and Mo [9,38], presents a more sustainable approach to meeting future demand (Fig. 6b). Conclusion and outlook The transition from laboratory research to the commercialization of catalysts is filled with challenges, but the potential rewards are substantial. This Perspective highlights the key criteria for success in Advanced Haber–Bosch process: determining the optimal operation conditions to balance thermodynamics and kinetics in order to maximize energy efficiency and NH3 yield, enhancing catalytic activity while considering practical factors like STY, and ensuring long-term stability under variable conditions. Furthermore, the formability of catalysts—showing high activity and structural integrity during the forming process—is crucial for industrial application. Marketability must also be prioritized, with attention to raw material availability and the feasibility of mass production of the catalyst product. While significant advancements have been made in our fundamental understanding of catalysis, the path to commercializing the catalyst requires a comprehensive approach that addresses these interconnected criteria. In this way, the future of NH3 production can be both technologically improved and economically sustainable. The quantitative criteria proposed in this work are based on minimal changes to the process configuration currently employed in Haber-Bosch process. The enhancement of process components other than catalysts (e.g. reactor type, separation methodology, and energy circulation) will result in a relaxation of the technical criteria for catalysts, thereby accelerating the realization of our aspirations. Furthermore, should the demand for NH3 be met in part by alternative processes, such as chemical looping, electrochemical-, photochemical-, and mechanochemical NH3 synthesis, this could also affect the marketability criteria for next-generation catalysts. Although this Perspective focuses on next-generation NH3 synthesis catalysts, the holistic consideration—from active site-scale to process-scale—can be similarly applicable to catalyst research and development across various applications.

        "dc:description": "Commercializing a catalyst developed in the laboratory is the aspiration of every catalyst researcher, but this step is highly challenging. This Perspective outlines the basic engineering criteria for developing next-generation catalysts capable of meeting the increasing global demand for renewable, carbon-free ammonia (NH3). A range of key technical and economic factors, extending from active site-scale considerations to process-scale viewpoints are presented. These are operation conditions, activity, long-term stability, formability, and marketability, and their quantitative criteria are proposed to ensure the practicality of the catalyst product. By addressing these interconnected criteria, this Perspective aims to bridge the gap between innovation in laboratory and industrial application, paving the way for a valuable future in catalyst research and development.",
