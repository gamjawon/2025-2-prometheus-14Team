Tel.: +86 22 24528359; fax: +86 22 24528504. The systematic investigation was carried out to elucidate the direct reaction between CO2 and phenol over multiphase catalyst. Reactions carried out over ZrO2, TiO2, and KF/NaY+Mn2+ gave the high selectivity to 4-[4-hydroxybenzyl]phenol and 2-[2-hydroxybenzyl]phenol (HBP), and the maximum HBP selectivity of 68% was obtained with ZrO2 as catalyst. XRD patterns showed that metastable tetragonal ZrO2 was the active phase for HBP synthesis, and the bidentate carbonate on ZrO2 surface was responsible for high HBP selectivity. If Hbeta, HZSM-5, and Al2O3 were used as catalyst, the main product was diphenyl ether (DPE). But when reactions were catalyzed by KY and KF/NaY, xanthone became the main product; however, xanthone disappeared when KF/NaY coexisted with Mn(OCOCH3)2 as catalyst. The optimized reaction conditions for HBP synthesis over tetragonal ZrO2 are 350°C, 12h, and 4.0MPa CO2 pressure. Graphical abstract The reaction between CO2 and phenol had been investigated. The product distributions are influenced by the catalyst usage. With ZrO2 as catalysts, the highest selectivity to 4-[4-hydroxybenzyl]phenol and 2-[2-hydroxybenzyl]phenol (HBP) was obtained, which may be ascribed to the bifunctional sites of catalyst. Metastable tetragonal ZrO2 was suggested to be the active phase, and the formation of HBP might be relevant with bidentate carbonate on ZrO2 surface. Keywords Phenol CO2 ZrO2 Bifunctional catalyst 1 Introduction Carbon dioxide is an attractive C1 building block in organic synthesis as it is highly functional, abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, and nonflammable. As petroleum reserves are depleted, the development of efficient catalytic processes employing CO2 as a feedstock has become increasingly important as evidenced by the intense research in this area in recent years [1]. For example, it has been shown that using CO2 as reactant one can generate formic acid [2], dimethyl formamide [3], formic acid [4,5], methanol [6], dialkyl carbonate [7], urea, carbamate [8,9], copolymer, cyclic carbonate [10], and salicylic acid [11]. Among the above mentioned researches, the synthesis of salicylic acid from phenoxide (Na or K) and carbon dioxide through Kolbe–Schmitt method has been practiced commercially for more than one century [12]; however, no studies on the direct reaction between phenol and CO2 under supercritical conditions were carried out until now. The reaction between phenol and CO2 might provide a new application of phenol and CO2 in organic synthesis just like the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from methanol and CO2 [13,14]. Furthermore, the reaction between phenol and CO2 might also provide a new method for the treatment of organic pollutant phenol [15]. In the catalytic reactions of carbon dioxide, ZrO2 is widely used as active catalyst for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and carbon oxide. Previous studies [16–18] indicated that CO2 reacted with amorphous ZrO2 to give HCO3 − which largely disappeared as temperature increased to 400°C. When tetragonal ZrO2 reacted with CO2 at 25°C, CO3 2− and HCO3 − ions were formed, and bidentate carbonate became the main species after reaction temperature increased to 400°C. If monoclinic ZrO2 reacted with CO2 at 400°C, a large amount of unidentate carbonate existed on the zirconia surface in addition to bidentate carbonate. The formation of bidentate and unidentate carbonate was due to coordinative unsaturated Zr4+–O2− pairs which was detected by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment [18,19]. Modes of the phenol adsorption on ZrO2 surface are non-planar and co-planar to the surface [20] and are governed by acid–base properties of ZrO2 [21,22]. Phenol and CO2 could compete for adsorption on the ZrO2 surface or reaction with ZrO2, since both phenol and CO2 are acids. If phenol adsorbs onto ZrO2, non-planar or co-planar phenoxide will be formed which might further react with CO2 to give salicylate, phenyl salicylate, or other derivatives through the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction. If CO2 adsorbs onto ZrO2, bidentate carbonate and unidentate carbonate will be formed at higher temperature, which might stop the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction and result in new products. Here, studies were carried out on the reaction between CO2 and phenol under supercritical conditions. Among the catalyst screened, ZrO2 is the best catalyst for this reaction. At the same time, effects of ZrO2 phase, reaction temperature, reaction duration, and CO2 pressure were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The preparation of zirconia by the hydrolysis of zirconium chloride with excess of NH4OH has been described previously [23]. A 10% solution of zirconium chloride was slowly added to a well-stirred precipitating solution of NH4OH (5M, ca. 50% excess base) at room temperature. After the addition of all the zirconium chloride, the base concentration was 0.55M. The precipitate was placed in a round-bottomed pyrex flask and refluxed at 100°C in the supernatant liquid for 48h. The precipitate was filtered and dried at 80°C for 6h. Pure ZrO2 was obtained and activated at certain temperature (400°C) for 3h before use. TiO2 was synthesized according to an earlier paper [24]. Titanium chloride (TiCl4) was dissolved in deionized water. Then, titanium hydroxide was precipitated from TiCl4 solution by adding ammonium hydroxide until pH 8.0. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water until complete elimination of chlorine ions in the liquid phase. The precipitate was filtered and dried at 80°C for 6h. Pure TiO2 was obtained and activated at 550°C for 3h before use. Commercial Hbeta (Si/Al=30) and HZSM-5 (Si/Al=50) were purchased from Nankai University. γ-Al2O3 was obtained from Shan Xi Commodity Chemistry Institute and NaY was purchased from QiLu Corporation. KY was obtained by exchange of NaY with a KCl solution (1molL−1) for three times. KF/NaY (10wt.%) was prepared by impregnation. Hbeta, HZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, KY, and KF/NaY were activated at 550°C in air for 3h before use. 2.2 Synthesis procedure A definite quantity of catalyst and phenol were placed in an autoclave of 250ml (inner volume). The autoclave was then sealed and flushed with CO2 to remove the air. After that, the CO2 was pressurized in the autoclave to a given pressure and the autoclave was heated to a given temperature. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The contents was diluted with THF and discharged to separate the catalyst by the simple filtration. 2.3 Analysis The structure of the products was confirmed by GC–MS (HP5972) (capillary column: 30m SE-30, 0.25mm i.d., and 0.25μm film thickness) and compared with authentical samples. Quantitative analysis was carried out on a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B with a FID detector, DB-1 capillary column) with cetane as interior standard. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern characterization of the catalyst samples was measured on a Bruker AXS (Germany) diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The data were recorded from 20° to 70° (2θ). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the mesoporous ZrO2 samples were measured at 77K on a micromeritics Tristar 3000 sorptometer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). Prior to the measurement, all samples were outgassed at 473K and 1.33×10−4 Pa over night. The specific surface areas of the mesoporous samples were calculated by the BET method. The pore size distribution of the samples was determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherms using the BJH method, and the pore size was obtained from the peak position of the distribution curves. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of catalyst on the product distribution The reaction results are listed in Table 1 . The product distribution was greatly affected by the use of the catalyst (see Scheme 1 ). When Hbeta, HZSM-5, and γ-Al2O3 were used as catalyst, the main products were DPE and HBP. In addition, a trace of ortho- or para-phenyl phenol, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanone, bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)methanone, salicylic acid, para-hydroxyl benzoic acid, phenyl salicylate, and phenyl 4-hydroxy benzoate were detected. If KY and KF/NaY were used as catalyst, xanthone was found as the main product. For example, xanthone selectivity was 64 and 46% with KY and KF/NaY as catalyst, respectively. However, xanthone disappeared and HBP became the main product when KF/NaY coexisted with Mn (OOCCH3)2 as catalyst. When ZrO2, TiO2, and KF/NaY+Mn2+ were used as catalyst, the high selectivity to HBP was obtained, and ZrO2 was the best catalysts for HBP formation of 67%. 3.2 Effect of ZrO2 morphology ZrO2 was activated at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600°C for 3h. XRD patterns of ZrO2 are shown in Fig. 1 . When ZrO2 was calcined at 200 and 300°C, the morphology of ZrO2 was amorphous. Both monoclinic and tetragonal phases were observed in the ZrO2 calcined at 500 and 600°C, and monoclinic phase became the main component. But only tetragonal phase was found in the ZrO2 calcined at 400°C. The textural and physical properties of the samples are summarized in Table 2 . The elevating of calcination temperature led to a continuous decrease of the specific surface area and the cumulative pore volume, while pore diameter increased from 6.3 to 12.2nm. Reactions catalyzed by ZrO2 were carried out, and results are listed in Fig. 2 . When amorphous ZrO2 calcined at 200 and 300°C was used as catalyst, HBP selectivity was 29 and 31%. The by-products including DPE, phenyl phenol, phenyl salicylate, xanthone, and xanthene were found. When tetragonal ZrO2 calcined at 400°C was used as catalyst, HBP selectivity was 45%. While ZrO2 calcined at 500 and 600°C were used as catalyst, HBP selectivity declined to 24 and 20%, but DPE selectivity increased to 5 and 19%. In addition, the others including xanthone and phenyl salicylate increased to 58 and 35%. Those results indicated that the most active phase for HBP formation was metastable tetragonal, while the BET surface and pore diameter were not the determined factor in HBP formation. Previous study [15] indicated that CO2 reacted with amorphous ZrO2 at 25°C to give HCO3 − which largely disappeared as temperature increased to 400°C. The tetragonal ZrO2 reacted with CO2 at 25°C to produce two principal CO3 2− and HCO3 − ions. After temperature increased to 400°C, bidentate carbonate became the main species. When monoclinic ZrO2 reacted with CO2 at 400°C, a large amount of unidentate carbonate existed on the zirconia surface in addition to bidentate carbonate. According to above described results, the conclusion could be drawn that the formation of HBP might be relevant with bidentate carbonate. Zr4+O2− Lewis acid/base pairs [25,26] might serve as active centers for the synthesis of HPB from phenol and carbon dioxide over zirconia. The formation of bidentate carbonate required an acid–base pair center associated with an anionic vacancy which would generate electron-rich zirconium cations [17]. As for amorphous ZrO2, there were less anionic vacancy and acid–base pair centers on the surface of ZrO2. The scarcity of bidentate carbonate on surface of amorphous zirconia might result in less HBP formation. Monoclinic ZrO2 had the strong Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity, which were investigated by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment [18,19]. Lewis acid site Zr4+ is responsible for DPE formation from phenol, while O2− promotes the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction between phenol and CO2 into phenyl salicylate and xanthone. 3.3 Effect of temperature Reactions were carried out at different temperature and results are shown in Fig. 3 . The reaction was hardly observed at 300°C because of the inert property of CO2. When reaction was carried out at 350°C, the highest HBP selectivity of 90% was achieved and the conversion of phenol amounted to 1.4%. After the reaction temperature increased to 400°C, much more coke, xanthene, xanthone, bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)methanone, and bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanone produced. In addition, the methylation of phenol detected at 400°C was due to the reaction among CO2, phenol and hydrogen. The hydrogen came from the thermolysis of phenol [27]. 3.4 Effect of duration Effect of reaction duration on the reaction between CO2 and phenol at 350°C was investigated and the results are listed in Fig. 4 . As the reaction time extended, both the selectivity to HBP and the conversion of phenol increased. The optimized reaction time for HBP synthesis was 12h, and HBP selectivity amounted to 87%. When reaction time exceeded to 12h, the selectivity to HBP declined due to ZrO2 lost activity from coke. 3.5 Effect of CO2 pressure The effects of CO2 pressure on reaction are listed in Fig. 5 . When reactions were carried out at low CO2 pressure, HBP was difficult to be synthesized while DPE was the main production. In addition, by-products including ortho-, para-phenyl phenol and benzofuranl were detected. After CO2 pressure increased to 4.0MPa, HBP selectivity achieved maximum of 72%. But when CO2 amounted to 5.0MPa, the selectivity to HBP declined, which was contrary to our primary expectation. High HBP selectivity was obtained at 4MPa due to the following reasons: first, high CO2 pressure was in favor of the formation of bidentate carbonate species; secondly, high density of CO2 facilitated the removal of compounds from the catalyst surface to keep catalyst from being deactivated. The reason for the decline of HBP selectivity at 5MPa might be that ZrO2 surface was occupied by CO2 molecule which kept phenol from reaction. 4 Conclusion In the reaction between phenol and CO2 under supercritical conditions, high HBP selectivity was achieved with ZrO2, TiO2 and KF/Ac+Mn2+ as catalysts, which might be ascribed to their bifunctional sites. If Hbeta, HZSM-5, and Al2O3 were used as catalyst, reactions gave a large amount of DPE. But when alkali KY and KF/NaY were used as catalyst, xanthone becomes the major compound because alkali site promotes reaction to adopt the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction. The high HBP selectivity was achieved over ZrO2, and metastable tetragonal ZrO2 was suggested to be active. The high HBP selectivity achieved over tetragonal ZrO2 may be relevant with bidentate carbonate on the surface of ZrO2. The optimized reaction conditions for HBP synthesis over tetragonal ZrO2 are 350°C, 12h, and 4.0MPa for reaction temperature, duration, and CO2 pressure, respectively.
