Graphical abstract MnO nanoparticles catalysis covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure serves as separator coating to enhance polysulfides conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical specific energy of 2600 Wh kg−1 are one of promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices. However, the severe shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides leads to rapid capacity decay during battery cycling, especially at high sulfur loading and high current density. Herein, the MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure (MnO@ERC) as separator coating for Li-S batteries is proposed. The MnO@ERC coating can act as upper current collector to enhance electrical conductivity of cathode and decrease the interface impedance of the whole battery. More importantly, both the polar MnO nanoparticles and Mn3O4 formed at the end of the charging process can catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides, which is convinced by the high adsorption energy and the elongate S–S bond. As a result, Li-S batteries based on MnO@ERC coating separator showed stable cycle for 350 cycles under 0.5C, high discharge specific capacity of 783.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, 534.7 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 5.26 mg cm−2 and low self-discharge rate of 9.1% after resting 48 h.. Keywords MnO/Carbon catalysis Endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure Separator coating Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction With the pressing demand of long-range electric vehicles and grid-scale battery storage, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, which have high theoretical specific energy of 2600 Wh kg−1, are considered as one potential candidate for next-generation energy storage devices [1,2]. Besides, sulfur, as the by-product of chemical industry, can contribute to the low cost of Li-S batteries and their sustainable development. However, some notorious obstacles impede the commercialization of Li-S batteries. First, sulfur and final discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2) are electronic and ionic insulating, which necessitate extra amount of conductive additives and result in low practical energy density of the whole Li-S batteries. Worse still, the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can dissolve in electrolyte and shuttle between cathode and anode, leading to active materials loss, poor cycling stability and low coulombic efficiency [3,4]. To overcome aforementioned problems, a great deal of efforts has been put forward over the past decade. One promising method is to construct a functional coating on one side of separator to mitigate LiPSs migration. Carbon materials, such as porous carbon [5–7], carbon nanotubes [8–10], graphene [11–13], double-layer carbon structure design [14] and their hybrids [15–17], were initially coated on the separator to trap LiPSs. However, the confinement of LiPSs by carbon was not effective due to the weak interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar LiPSs. Since then, polar materials, such as transition metal compounds [18–21], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [22–24] and polymers [25–28], have attracted more attention because they can trap LiPSs more effectively in a chemical way. Some of the metal oxides engage in surface redox with LiPSs, some metal oxides with higher redox potential oxidize LiPSs to sulfate and thiosulfate [29]. By designing appropriate nanostructure and chemical composition, the polar coating materials can not only afford strong physical and chemical adsorption of LiPSs, but also promote the conversion between long-chain and short-chain LiPSs. The catalysis of LiPSs conversion has been demonstrated to be the fundamental approach to fast redox kinetics, which can weaken the shuttle effect. Traces of catalysts can reduce the accumulation of Li2S/Li2S2 on the surface of electrode and the amount of LiPSs in electrolyte. Moreover, they can improve the active materials utilization and Li+/e– transport. By taking advantages of catalysts, Li-S batteries can exhibit superior electrochemical performance. Recently, metal compounds, such as MoS2 [30–32], CoS x [33,34], MS x [35,36], CoP [37], FeP [38,39], TiO x [40], Nb2O5 [41], Ti3C2 [42,43], Ti3C2T x [44,45], Mo2C-C [46], Co-N-C [47,48], LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 [49], La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 [50], others like framework porphyrin [51] have been added in the sulfur cathode as the catalyst, and the electrochemical performance of Mn-based composites for Li-S batteries is included in Table S1. However, few studies have focused on the catalysts on the separator. The Li-S batteries with MnO/mCNF interlayer presented 730 mAh g−1 at 1 C under the sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm−2 [52]. Ketjen black-MnO coated separator endowed Li-S batteries 1059 mAh g−1 at 1 C under the sulfur loading of 1.2 mg cm−2 [21]. The mechanism of the catalyst on the separator and their electrochemical properties under high sulfur loading/limited electrolyte should be explored. Inspired by this, an ideal separator coating should not only provide the anchored active site for LiPSs, but also catalyze their conversion. Herein, we demonstrated the MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure (MnO@ERC) as separator coating for Li-S batteries. MnO@ERC was obtained by one-step heat treatment of 2D Mn-MOF precursor, which was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method [53]. The specific preparation process is shown in Fig. S1, and described in detail in the experimental section. The MnO@ERC coating has following characteristic: (1) the endoplasmic-reticulum-like carbon favors electron transport so that the MnO@ERC coating can act as upper current collector to improve the utilization of sulfur spices and decrease the interface impedance of the whole battery; (2) the MnO@ERC coating can block the diffusion of dissolved LiPSs, and the polar MnO nanoparticles and Mn3O4 formed at the end of the charging process play the role in adsorption and catalysis; (3) the MnO@ERC coating with high specific surface area is much easier to be saturated with the electrolyte than the traditional PP membrane, which makes lithium ion distribution uniform and suppress lithium dendrite growth; (4) MOFs with suitable pores are desirable precursor to get well-dispersed MnO nanoparticles within the endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure, enhancing catalytic function. Benefited from the synergistic effect, Li-S batteries based on MnO@ERC coating separator showed preferable electrochemical performance under higher sulfur loading/limited electrolyte and low self-discharge rate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Mn-MOF and MnO@ERC 1.35 g manganese acetate (C4H6O4Mn·4H2O) and 1.35 g benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) were slowly dissolved in 60 mL HCON(CH3)2 (DMF) under magnetic stir for 12 h at room temperature. After that, 1.83 g terephthalic acid (C8H6O4) was added into the above solution and kept stirring until the solid nanoparticles disappeared. Then, the homogeneous solution was transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave suffering from hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 10 h. After cooling down, white precipitates were collected via a couple of times filter washing with ethanol and distilled water until the pH of the filtrate is neutral. Afterwards, Mn-MOF was obtained after dried at 80 °C overnight. The MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure, served as the coating materials, were finally acquired after sintering Mn-MOF in Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h with the ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. 2.2 Preparation of MnO@ERC coating separator and sulfur cathode To obtain the modified separator, a homogeneous slurry was prepared by mixing MnO@ERC and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder in a mass ratio of 5:1 in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent at room temperature. Then, the slurry was coated onto the blank separator by doctor-blade. After that, the modified separator was transferred into the oven and dried at 60 °C for 48 h. The MnO@ERC coated separator and blank separator were both cut into circular membrane with the diameter of 19 mm. To prepare the sulfur cathode, sulfur powders, acetylene black and PVDF binder were mixed in a mass ratio of 7:2:1 in the NMP solvent at room temperature forming a homogeneous slurry. Next, the obtained slurry was coated onto the aluminum foil using doctor-blade method. Finally, the cathode was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and cut into disk (11 mm diameter). The actual sulfur content in sulfur/carbon composite was about 75.25%. 2.3 Characterization The micro-morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by FE-SEM (FEI Quanta 250, USA) and HRTEM (JEOL-2010, Japan). The XRD patterns of the coating materials were recorded by a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV-185, Japan) with Cu K α radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in the scan range of 10°–90° at a scan rate of 8° min−1. The Raman spectra of MnO@ERC was acquired by a spectrometer (Renishaw-1000, British) using an excitation laser beam with wavelength of 532 nm. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of the modified materials were measured by a micromeritics instrument (ASAP 2460, USA) at 77 K. The XPS spectra of the prepared MnO@ERC were performed by a Kratos Analytical spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi, USA) with monochromatic Al K α radiation (1486.6 eV). The TG curve of sulfur/carbon composite was conducted by a thermal gravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449 F5 Jupiter, Germany). The ICP test of MnO@ERC was performed by an Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer (Agilent ICPOES730, USA). Contact angles of 1 M LiTFSI/DOL:DME (1:1, V:V)/0.2 M LiNO3 on the blank separator and MnO@ERC coating separator were collected by a Contact Angle analyzer (Dataphysics OCA 25, Germany). In-situ XRD patterns were offered by the in-situ cell, which was composed of sulfur cathode on the thin aluminum current collector, thin lithium metal anode, less electrolyte and the modified separator, and the change of the materials could be observed through the Be window. 2.4 Electrochemical measurement To study the coating effect, CR-2016 coin-type cells were assembled by blank separator or MnO@ERC modified separator, lithium metal anode (1 mm thickness and 12 mm diameter), 60 μL electrolyte (the same with the electrolyte in contact angles test) and sulfur cathode in the Ar-filled glovebox. Then the Li-S batteries were galvanostatically charged/discharged between 1.7–2.8 V by the LAND electronics and all the specific capacities were calculated based on the mass of sulfur. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted by the electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai) in the voltage range of 1.5–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. And electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also recorded by the electrochemical workstation in the frequency range of 10–2–105 Hz at 5 mV voltage amplitude. CV of symmetric cells was assembled by the blank separator or MnO@ERC modified separator, carbon paper and Li2S6 electrolyte in the Ar-filled glovebox. The cells for potentiostatic discharge test were assembled by the blank separator or MnO@ERC modified separator, carbon paper, lithium metal anode and Li2S8 electrolyte in the Ar-filled glovebox. 2.5 Visualized adsorption of Li2S6 The 5 mmol L−1 of Li2S6 solution was prepared by dissolving 8.0 mg of sulfur powders and 2.3 mg of Li2S with molar ratio of 5:1 in 10 mL of DME solution followed by intense magnetic stirring until the reaction was complete. Then 10 mg of MnO@ERC was added into 2 mL of the Li2S6 solution for the visualized adsorption test. 2.6 Computational method First-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed by CASTEP module of Materials Studio 2019 software with Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) function in generalized-gradient approximation (GGA). In geometry optimizations, the maximum force convergence and the cut-off energy were set to be below 0.03 eV Å−1 and 400 eV. The Brillouin zone with 2 × 2 × 1 k-points was sampled. The adsorption energy (E a) of Li2S4 on the surface of MnO (200) and carbon (002) was calculated according to Equations (1) and (2). (1) E a 1 = E Li 2 S 4 + MnO - E Li 2 S 4 - E MnO , (2) E a 2 = E Li 2 S 4 + carbon - E Li 2 S 4 - E carbon , where E Li2S4+MnO, E Li2S4, E MnO, E Li2S4+carbon and E carbon were the energy of Li2S4-MnO, Li2S4, MnO, Li2S4 + ERC and ERC, respectively. 3 Results and discussion To form the 2D structural Mn-MOFs precursor, benzoic acid with single –COOH was added initially and occupied the opposite two-directions of the Mn2+ of manganese acetate under the effect of steric hindrance. After the coordination compounds fully interacted with center ions, terephthalic acid was added as bridge ligand, resulting in the planar assembling of Mn-MOF [53]. The principle of the whole assembly process was shown in Fig. S2. Fig. 1 (a) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure of the Mn-MOF, each layer of which was interlaced. The SEM image in Fig. 1(b) further indicated that the endoplasmic-reticulum face was flat and intact without any obvious defects and damage, which was also characterised by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1c and d). After calcinating Mn-MOF at high-temperature, the black powder of MnO@ERC was finally obtained, as shown in Fig. S3. Compared with the Mn-MOF precursor, the carbonized one showed similar endoplasmic-reticulum-like morphology with slight broken pieces, as shown in Fig. 1(e) and its magnification image (Fig. 1f). And the thickness of each endoplasmic-reticulum-like carbon layer was around 380 nm as measured in Fig. 1(g). From the SEM image of the MnO@ERC (Fig. 1h), it can be discovered that the plane was slightly contracted and wrinkled. From the TEM image of the MnO@ERC, the formed MnO nanoparticles can be clearly observed (black dark spots, Fig. 1i) and they were evenly distributed. The nanoparticles were around 20 nm in diameter (acquired from Fig. 1j), providing the adsorption and catalysis active sites of LiPSs. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1k) of the dark spot indicated that the lattice fringe spacing was 0.22 nm, corresponding to the cubic phase MnO (200) lattice plane. The equivalent selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1l) further confirmed the introduction of MnO nanoparticles. Therefore, MnO nanoparticles were embedded into the carbon matrix, forming unique endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure. To further prove the formation of MnO, XRD analysis (Fig. 2 a) was conducted with the strong diffraction peaks at 36.3°, 43.7°, 58.5°, 72.6°, 74.6°, which is corresponding with the lattice plane (021), (050), (151), (080), (321) of MnO (MnO JCPDS card No. 07-0230), respectively. Raman spectrum analysis was used to investigate the carbon layer structure of the ERC (Fig. 2b), showing the characteristic peaks at 1341 cm−1 (D band) and 1586 cm−1 (G band). The D band was attributed to the vibration of sp3 carbon atom, standing for the defects and disorders. Correspondingly, the G band was attributed to the E 2g vibration of sp2 carbon atom, standing for the graphitization and ordered structure. The MnO@ERC showed appropriate I D/I G, indicating its good electrical conductivity. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the MnO@ERC (Fig. 2c) exhibited obvious uptake at P/P 0 > 0.4 (type IV) and the hysteresis loops ranged from 0.45 to 1.0 of P/P 0 (H4), suggesting its rich pore structure. The pore diameters calculated by DFT method were around 5 nm (mesopore) and 60 nm (macropore), and the specific surface area of the MnO@ERC was 225.25 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4, Supporting Information). The mesopore was able to restrain the shuttle effect of long chain LiPSs while the macropores allowed rapid diffusion of the electrolyte. The large specific surface area increased the exposure of the active sites on the MnO@ERC to electrolyte. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. S5), the surface chemistry of the MnO@ERC can be clearly characterized. The observed peaks at 642.0, 532.08, 286.08 and 49.08 eV were corresponding to Mn 2p, O 1s, C 1s and Mn 3s. The high-resolution XPS of Mn 2p after fitting was shown in Fig. 2(d) with main peaks centered at 641.8 and 653.4 eV assigning to Mn(II) 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2. Fig. 2(e) showed the fitted high-resolution XPS of O 1s with main peaks centered at 530.1, 532.5 and 533.7 eV ascribing to the state of O in Mn−O, O−H and C−O. The specific environment of oxygen was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig. 2f), including O−H stretching vibration (3434 cm−1), bending vibration (752 cm−1), and C−O stretching vibration (1109 cm−1). The peaks at 2929, 1405 and 834 cm−1 manifested C−H stretching vibration in alkyl group, and bending vibration in alkyl group and arene group. The remaining peaks at 1660 and 1563 cm−1 indicated that C = C not only existed in benzene ring, but also consisted in olefin generated during the carbonation process. The weight percentage of MnO and ERC in MnO@ERC was about 23.16% and 76.84%, respectively, conducted from ICP test. The SEM image of the blank separator (Fig. 2g) showed fair-sized pore structure, which allowed LiPSs to pass through and etch lithium metal anode. And then the reaction products Li2S2/Li2S can cover lithium metal surface, which leads to the loss of sulfur and lithium metal and cut down the coulombic efficiency and cycle life of Li-S batteries. To solve these problems, endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure MnO@ERC was coated on separator. After coating, no obvious pores were observed from the SEM images (Fig. 2h), and the thickness of the coating layer was around 11.6 μm, which did not increase much mass burden to the battery (Fig. 2i). To further test the hydrophilicity and wettability of the coating materials to the electrolyte, the same amount of electrolyte was dropped onto the blank separator and MnO@ERC modified separator, respectively. The blank separator kept a large contact angle of 36°, whereas the electrolyte on the MnO@ERC modified separator almost completely dispersed (Fig. 2j). The enhanced affinity to the electrolyte was due to the large specific surface area and the endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure of the coating materials. With better wettability, it was beneficial to enlarging the contact surface between separator and electrolyte. To further study the working mechanism of the separator coating, different Li-S batteries with blank separator and MnO@ERC modified separator were assembled and their electrochemical performance was tested. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to quantitatively investigate the internal resistance. The semicircle in the high frequency region represents interface impedance of solid electrolyte interface film (SEI) formed at the electrode/electrolyte interface (R S). The semicircle in the middle frequency region represents charge transfer resistance (R ct) and the oblique line in the low frequency region represents the Warburg resistance (or called concentration polarization impedance) caused by Li+ diffusion into the electrode active materials (W) [54]. Through circuit simulation, the specific value of corresponding resistance was calculated, as shown in Fig. 3 (a) and Table S2. The battery with MnO@ERC modified separator (2.65 Ω cm−2) exhibited relatively larger R S compared with the battery using blank separator (1.33 Ω cm−2), which was due to the presence of semi-conductivity MnO in the coating. On the other hand, R ct of the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator (32.83 Ω cm−2) was only 77% of that of the reference battery (42.26 Ω cm−2), suggesting faster kinetics arising from the catalysis of MnO and reduced Li+ transport resistance benefiting from the good wettability of the MnO@ERC coating. In order to further explore the working mechanism of MnO and observe the phase change in real time during the electrochemical reaction process, in-situ XRD of Li-S battery with MnO@ERC modified separator was conducted (Fig. 3b). It can be observed that sulfur characteristic peaks disappeared during discharging, and showed again at the end of the charging, accompanied with the typical peaks of Mn3O4 due to the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ in the electrochemical reaction window [55,56]. Mn3O4 participated in catalyzing initial discharge reaction. Along with the electrochemical reaction, Mn3O4 was reduced to form MnO, which was involved in catalyzing subsequent discharge process. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the reversibility of electrode reaction. The cyclic voltammograms of the batteries with different separators were shown in Fig. 3(c and d). Both two kinds of batteries exhibited typical two cathodic peaks at around 2.30 and 2.00 V, corresponding to the two-step reduction process from sulfur to long chain LiPSs (Li2S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and the successive conversion to Li2S, respectively, and one anodic peak corresponding to their reversible oxidation process [36,55,56]. Obviously, two cathodic peaks of the battery using blank separator were much wider and flatter, indicating larger polarization and limited sulfur utilization during the electrochemical reaction, especially during the transformation process from long chain LiPSs to Li2S. After the first cycle, the cathodic peak at 2.02 V significantly shifted left to 1.97 V in the second cycle, which was due to the accumulation of insoluble Li2S2/Li2S on the electrode or in the electrolyte. As for the battery using MnO@ERC modified separator, the anodic peak showed a slight split, attributed to the interaction between MnO and LiPSs. And the position and intensity of the peaks did not show noticeable change during the first three cycles, indicating great reversibility of electrochemical reaction process and the redox process between MnO and Mn3O4. More importantly, the voltage difference between the anodic peak and the cathodic peak around 2.00 V of the battery with MnO@ERC coating separator (0.46 V) was smaller than that of the battery with blank separator (0.50 V), indicating that smaller polarization and faster redox kinetics were enabled by MnO@ERC coating. The catalytic effect of MnO nanoparticles on LiPSs conversion was further convinced by the charge/discharge behavior of the assembled Li-S batteries at the rate of 0.2 C in the voltage window from 1.7 to 2.8 V. Both discharge curves of batteries with different separators showed two typical plateaus (Fig. 3e), corresponding with two-step conversion reaction of sulfur species. Notably, the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator delivered much higher specific capacity of 366 mAh g−1 at the first discharge platform around 2.3 V. This improvement was attributed to the good charge-transfer ability and confinement of LiPSs. The strengthened interaction between MnO@ERC and LiPSs was proved by the adsorption experiment shown in Fig. S6. After adding MnO@ERC into the solution with Li2S6 adsorbate, the solution changed from yellow to colorless and transparent. In addition, the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator showed prolonged second plateau around 2.1 V compared with that of the blank sample. Also, the overpotential of battery with MnO@ERC modified separator was deceased by 47%, signifying lower Li2S nucleation energy barrier. After 100 cycles, as shown in Fig. S8, the Li-S battery with MnO@ERC modified separator still kept discharge specific capacity of 783.6 mAh g−1 with 65% capacity retention ratio based on the first cycle (1198.6 mAh g−1). Comparatively, the battery using blank separator only retained 55% discharge specific capacity of the first cycle (1197.9 mAh g−1). The long-term cycle performance of Li-S battery with MnO@ERC modified separator under higher rate of 0.5C was shown in Fig. S9. The battery was first activated for two cycles at 0.1 C, and exhibited a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1454.6 and 1065.9 mAh g−1 in the first cycle at 0.5 C. After 350 cycles, the battery still retained 554.0 mAh g−1. Particularly, there was no obvious capacity fading in the last 150 cycles. Fig. S10 showed the rate ability of the batteries with different separators. The battery with MnO@ERC coating separator exhibited high specific capacities of around 1129.6, 976.3, 825.2, 658.1 and 502.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. When the rate returned to 0.1 C, there was still remaining 987.5 mAh g−1, 87% discharge capacity of the initial stage. Comparatively, the battery using blank separator only delivered specific capacities of approximate 832.9, 684.0, 626.0, 597.9 and 499.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. When the rate returned to 0.1 C, there was just remaining 708.2 mAh g−1. The rate test not only proved the high reaction kinetics of the battery under MnO adsorption and catalysis to LiPSs even at 2 C, but also gave a strong proof of the great reversibility of the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator. The mass loading of the MnO@ERC coating and sulfur loading influenced the electrochemical performance and practical application of Li-S batteries. When tested under 5.26 mg cm−2 at 0.1 C, as shown in Fig. S11, MnO@ERC coating at the mass loading of 0.53 mg cm−2 could not effectively catalyze LiPSs conversion and inhibit LiPSs shuttle, which was slightly better than using the blank separator. At the loading of 1.94 mg cm−2, MnO@ERC coating was too thick to fully contact with LiPSs, and increased mass transfer impedance. Under the reasonable loading of 1.06 mg cm−2, the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator exhibited uppermost discharge specific capacity of 657.5 mAh g−1 after few cycles of activation (Fig. 3f). After 100 cycles, it still kept 534.7 mAh g−1 with 81.3% capacity retention ratio based on the maximum capacity. In contrast, the Li-S battery with the blank separator showed average discharge specific capacity only around 260 mAh g−1 under the same condition, and easily failed after just 35 cycles. When tested at the rate of 1 C (Fig. 3g), the battery using MnO@ERC modified separator showed significant advantage due to the improved electrical conductivity and inevitable catalysis for LiPSs. The MnO@ERC modified separator endows Li-S batteries with greater electrochemical performance. When the sulfur loading was increased to 8.42 mg cm−2 and the amount of the electrolyte was reduced to 38 μL, the E/S ratio was controlled to 4.75 μL mg−1 (Fig. 3h). Under such harsh conditions, Li-S battery with the blank separator could not work. After decorating the separator with MnO@ERC, the battery displayed peak discharge specific capacity of 251.7 mAh g−1 after few cycles of activation at 0.1 C. Although the discharge capacity was not satisfactory, MnO@ERC improved the conversion of LiPSs. The limited electrolyte dissolved a large number of LiPSs, then LiPSs concentration inevitably increased, ionic conductivity of the electrolyte decreased, polarization increased, sulfur utilization finally decreased [57]. Self-discharge behavior is considered as the result of the reaction between LiPSs and lithium metal anode. To test the effect of MnO@ERC coating on self-discharge behavior, Li-S batteries with blank separator and MnO@ERC modified separator were cycled at the rate of 0.2 C for 4 cycles and then rested for 48 h, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). During these 48 h, the open circuit voltages were being monitored in real time after the batteries were charged to 2.8 V (Fig. 4b). At the beginning, the voltage of both batteries dropped abruptly to around 2.38 V showing similar pattern. However, after 30 h, the battery with blank separator occurred serious self-discharge and the voltage dropped to 2.25 V at the end of the rest process, which was due to the shuttle and loss of LiPSs. By contrast, the voltage of the battery with MnO@ERC modified separator kept stable above 2.32 V during the whole rest 48 h. After resting, the batteries continued to cycle under the same condition, and the voltage curves of the fourth cycle before rest and the fifth cycle after rest were compared in Fig. 4(c and d). With a huge capacity loss rate of 37.2%, the specific capacity of the battery with blank separator decreased from 955.3 mAh g−1 (4th cycle) to 600.2 mAh g−1 (5th cycle). When the battery using MnO@ERC coating separator, the discharge capacity in the fourth cycle was 1042.3 mAh g−1, and the capacity loss was only 9.1% during the rest period (decreasing to 946.9 mAh g−1 in the fifth cycle), which performed much better than the battery with blank separator. In the sixth cycle, the capacity restored to its pre-rest level of 1003.2 mAh g−1. However, it was difficult for the battery with blank separator to recover (809.1 mAh g−1 in the sixth cycle), and there was always a large capacity difference around 200 mAh g−1 in each of these cycles. These results revealed that the active materials loss caused by shuttle effect was irreversible, and the MnO@ERC coating can effectively confine LiPSs within cathode side and enhance the sulfur utilization. To explore the protection effect of MnO@ERC coating on lithium metal, the Li-S battery was disassembled after 5 cycles at the rate of 0.1 C. Then the lithium anode was taken out and cleaned with DME, and the surface morphology could be observed. Fig. 4(e) showed the cracks and rough on the lithium metal anode in the battery using blank separator, which was mainly caused by the attack of LiPSs to the inherently unstable solid electrolyte interface film. After modifying the separator, lithium metal surface became relatively smooth without obvious cracks and dendrites, as shown in Fig. 4(f), benefiting from the mitigation of LiPSs shuttle by MnO@ERC coating. The CV profiles of the symmetrical cells with Li2S6 electrolyte suggested greater ability of MnO@ERC coating to facilitate LiPSs conversion, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The cell with the blank separator presented broader cathodic peak of –0.39 V, and anodic peaks of 0.44 and 0.78 V. By contrast, the cell with MnO@ERC modified separator displayed sharper cathodic peak of –0.21 V, and anodic peaks of 0.14 and 0.57 V. On the one hand, MnO@ERC coating delivered larger current density at a certain polarization voltage, declaring faster kinetics of the LiPSs reaction. On the other hand, the modified coating demonstrated lower potential at a certain current density, indicating lower overpotential of LiPSs conversion under MnO@ERC electrocatalysis. The MnO@ERC coating exhibited higher Li2S nucleation capacities and larger current density than the blank counterpart, indicating the auxo-action on Li2S nucleation (Fig. 5b and c). To understand catalytic mechanism at the atomic level, first-principle calculations based on DFT was performed to get the adsorption energy (E a). Fig. 5(d and e) described the most favorable adsorption structure of Li2S4 on the surface of MnO (200) and carbon (002) before and after geometry and energy optimizations. And the E a of Li2S4-MnO system was –3.641 eV, which was much higher than that in Li2S4-carbon system (–0.149 eV), suggesting that MnO played the major role in inhibiting polysulfides shuttling. In particular, the S–S bond length of Li2S4 was 2.090 Å, which was increased to 5.929 Å after interacting with MnO. In contrast it was only increased to 2.113 Å after interacting with ERC, which meant that the S–S bond was easier to break on the surface of MnO. MnO was able to catalyze the formation of Li2S2 and decrease the nucleation overpotential of solid polysulfides. The catalysis of MnO effectively improved utilization of polysulfides and cycle performance. As shown in Fig. 5(f), both MnO and ERC could interact with LiPSs, whereas MnO played the major role in inhibiting soluble LiPSs shuttling, catalyzing the formation of solid LiPSs and decreasing the nucleation overpotential of solid LiPSs, ERC acting as the carrier of MnO could spread out MnO catalyst evenly and provide better conductivity for LiPSs and catalyst. 4 Conclusions In summary, the MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure was coated on separator for enhancing Li-S batteries performance. The obtained MnO@ERC with large specific surface area intensified wettability to the electrolyte and provided sufficient storage space of LiPSs. The endoplasmic-reticulum-like carbon decreased the interface impedance of the whole battery. More importantly, the polar MnO nanoparticles and Mn3O4 produced at the end of the charge process can effectively seize LiPSs and catalyze the conversion reaction. As a result, Li-S batteries based on MnO@ERC coating separator showed stable cycle for 350 cycles under 0.5 C, high discharge specific capacity of 783.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, 534.7 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 5.26 mg cm−2, and low self-discharge rate of 9.1% after resting 48 h. These results offered insights on the catalysis effect of separator on performance of Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical specific energy of 2600 Wh kg−1 are one of promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices. However, the severe shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides leads to rapid capacity decay during battery cycling, especially at high sulfur loading and high current density. Herein, the MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure (MnO@ERC) as separator coating for Li-S batteries is proposed. The MnO@ERC coating can act as upper current collector to enhance electrical conductivity of cathode and decrease the interface impedance of the whole battery. More importantly, both the polar MnO nanoparticles and Mn3O4 formed at the end of the charging process can catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides, which is convinced by the high adsorption energy and the elongate S–S bond. As a result, Li-S batteries based on MnO@ERC coating separator showed stable cycle for 350 cycles under 0.5C, high discharge specific capacity of 783.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, 534.7 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 5.26 mg cm−2 and low self-discharge rate of 9.1% after resting 48 h..",
