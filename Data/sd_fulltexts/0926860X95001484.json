Keipert, Dorit Wolf, Philippe Schulz 1, Manfred Baerns * Lehrstuhl fiir Technische Chemie, Ruhr-Universitiit Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany Received 19 May 1995; accepted 21 June 1995 Abstract The kinetics of the catalytic ethane aromatization over Ga- ( 3 wt.-%) H-ZSM-5 (Si/AI = 15) were investigated in a catalytic fixed-bed micro reactor under atmospheric pressure. Reaction temperatures were 873,898, and 923 K; inlet partial pressures ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 bar for ethane and from 0.1 to 0.7 bar for hydrogen. The aromatization reaction was described by a 4-step reaction scheme, comprising the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons via the subsequent formation of ethylene and higher alkenes, and the formation of methane as a side product of cracking. The kinetic model takes into account the bifunctionality of the catalyst by assuming gallium sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane and acid sites for alkene interconversion and aromatics formation. The latter proceeds with the formation of surface hydrogen on the zeolite, which can only desorb after a back-spillover step to the gallium sites.

One option is the aromatization of C2 +-alkanes, which was first discov- ered by Csicsery in 1970 [ 1-5 ]. Since the introduction of the pentasil-type zeolite ZSM-5 as the aromatization catalyst, this reaction was intensively investigated [ 6- 11 ] and worked out to industrial maturity [ 12]. There is general consensus about the advantage of doping the acid H-ZSM-5 to provide additional dehydrogenation properties. In literature, gallium compounds are mostly preferred over platinum, which possesses high hydrogenolysis activity [ 13 ], and zinc, which is susceptible * Corresponding author. Tel.

The majority of publications, which has been reviewed by two authors in 1992 [ 15,16], deals with the aromati- zation of propane and higher hydrocarbons. However, it seems less known that, at temperatures from 773 K, ethane can also be converted to aromatics with high selectivity. This is reflected by the relatively few number of groups which syste- matically studied the aromatization of ethane [ 13,17-19 ]. The mechanistic essentials of the aromatization reaction have been investigated and extensively discussed in the past ten years. Among unsaturated hydrocarbons, classical carbenium ion chemistry on the acid sites of the zeolite is able to explain reactions such as oligomerization, cracking, skeletal isomerization, and hydride transfer [20]. This type of reactions, which proceed on the BrCnsted sites of the zeolite, is also responsible for the formation of naphthenes (by intramolecular alkylation) and their subsequent dehydrogenation to aromatics (under simultane- ous hydrogenation of other unsaturates). Additionally, the high acidity of the BrCnsted sites enables reaction pathways proceeding via nonclassical carbonium ions, i.e., through the attack of a proton on a saturated carbon atom [21]. The decomposition of carbonium ions produces smaller alkanes and alkenes. For exam- ple, methane and ethylene are produced from propane; while methane is lost for further catalytic reactions, ethylene can subsequently undergo the aromatization sequence. In the case of ethane, however, reaction rates remain low over undoped H-ZSM-5 [ 18,19 ]. Here, doping the zeolite to catalyze the initial dehydrogenation to ethylene is absolutely mandatory. Furthermore, the dopant generally promotes direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in all stages of the aromatization reaction with accompanying formation of molecular hydrogen. Hereby, the undesired for- mation of saturated hydrocarbons as by-products of the hydride transfer is reduced. The doped zeolites were proved to possess bifunctional catalytic properties [ 22]. It was further claimed that surface hydrogen species are formed on the ZSM-5 during dehydrogenation steps [ 23]. On undoped H-ZSM-5, their slow recombi- native desorption leads to an enrichment of surface hydrogen, which inhibits aro- matization and promotes the formation of alkanes. Doping the zeolite facilitates the removal of surface hydrogen by back-spillover to the dopant, and ultimately leads to higher rates of hydrogen desorption and aromatization [24-26]. The aromatization reaction comprises numerous possible reaction pathways, including a large number of hydrocarbons. Hence, a kinetic description of the overall reaction has to be based on certain simplifying assumptions. Besides several publications dealing exclusively with the first step of alkane aromatization [27- 31 ], a rather complex kinetic formulation of aromatization and cracking reactions on ZSM-5 catalysts has been elaborated by Lukyanov [ 32-35]. Using this model, which contains a high number of kinetic parameters, data of the aromatization of propane, propene and ethylene over H-ZSM-5 and Ga-H-ZSM-5 has been simulated without the application of a numerical optimization strategy, i.e., an estimation of statistically optimal parameters has not been pursued yet. O.P. Keipert et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 34~365 349 The present contribution deals with the kinetics of ethane aromatization over a gallium-doped H-ZSM-5 of which the composition had been optimized in previous screening work [19]. The aim was, on the one hand, to fulfil the demand for technical kinetics suitable for reaction engineering purposes; therefore, this work includes a strategy for numerical data fitting and parameter estimation. On the other hand, the kinetic model is largely based on physicochemically plausible mechanistic assumptions which comply with literature data, thus preserving options for extrap- olation. Non-avoidable simplifications simply reflect the observations made under the actual reaction conditions applied in this work. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The Ga-doped zeolite was prepared by wet impregnation of a H-ZSM-5 zeolite ( Si/A1 = 15 ) with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3) 3 (99.99%, Aldrich Chemicals) to obtain a gallium content of 3 wt.-%; the zeolite and its characterization had been provided by Elf Aquitaine. The catalyst precursor was dried at 393 K for 16 h, pressed into pellets at 400 bar, crushed, and sieved to grains of 250-355 /xm. Calcination was accomplished by heating the catalyst to 858 K at a low rate of 2 K/min in a flow of dry air. 2.2. Kinetic experiments The reaction was carried out in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor (I.D. 12 mm) made of quartz, which was heated by an electric oven. The catalyst was packed between two layers of quartz grains. The temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored with an axially movable thermocouple located inside a centered quartz capillary. The charge of the catalyst ranged from 0.1 to 1 g. The feed gases (ethane, 99.95%, nitrogen, 99.99%, hydrogen, 99.999%) were purchased from Messer-Griesheim. Prior to kinetic measurements, the reactor was purged with nitrogen. The experi- ments were performed at 873, 898, and 923 K at atmospheric pressure. Reaction rates were measured under differential conversion conditions: ( 1 ) the partial pres- sure of ethane was varied between 0.1 and 0.8 bar, (2) the partial pressure of hydrogen was varied between 0.1 and 0.7 bar under a constant partial pressure of 0.2 bar of ethane. In each series, nitrogen was used as diluent. Integral kinetic data were obtained by varying the modified contact time mcat/(1o between 0.05 and 3.2 g s mol- 1, using a 0.8/0.2 bar mixture of ethane/nitrogen. To prevent condensation of aromatics, the reaction products were passed through heated lines. G.C. analyses (HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph, procedure see [ 19] ) were performed within the first hour of time-on-stream. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard to monitor material balances and the volume change during the aromatization reaction. 350 O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 Feed conversion X, selectivities Si, and yields Y~ were computed on a carbon-number basis. A kinetic run was accepted for further evaluation when the carbon balance did not deviate from unity by more than 10%. Catalyst regeneration was achieved by flushing the reactor with nitrogen first; hereafter, coke was burned off by grad- ually replacing nitrogen with air. This care had to be taken to avoid overheating of the catalyst by the strongly exothermic coke oxidation. 2.3. Kinetic modeling The reactor was modeled as an isothermally operating tubular plug flow reactor, for which the differential material balance of a component i can be written as [ 36] : dtJi = Ridmcat = ( ~_at,ijrj)dmcat ( 1 ) J where Ri is the molar rate of change, rj denotes the rate of the jth reaction, each expressed per mass unit of catalyst, and the v0 are the stoichiometric coefficients. Presuming validity of the perfect gas law, (Eq. 1 ) may be rewritten as d (pill) = RT( y\" vi;rj) dm~,t (2) The change of volume of the reaction mixture, leading to a variable flow-rate, is taken into account by substituting the left hand side of (Eq. 2) by pidl?+ l)dp~.

This differential equation system was integrated numerically over the modified contact time mcat/(/o by a gear algorithm [37]. The relative volume change was calculated taking into account the stoichiometry of the products formation. For the parameter estimation procedure, data for differential and integral conversions were simultaneously evaluated. For the determination of activation energies and adsorp- tion enthalpies, data from all temperatures were used simultaneously, where preex- ponential factors refer to the temperature of 898 K due to a Himmelblau transformation. A two-stage strategy for parameter search was applied. It (1) consisted of the determination of initial guesses by means of a genetic search algorithm (GA), which will be described in detail elsewhere [38 ], and is followed by (2) optimization runs using the simplex routine of Nelder and Mead [39,40] to achieve local convergence. The GA is preferentially applicable where little or no prior information is available about the order of magnitude of kinetic parameters. O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 351 In complex nonlinear optimization problems, the topology of the merit function, e.g. a weighted sum of least squares, may possess, along with the global minimum, many local minima. Conventional 'downhill' methods, starting from a given param- eter vector, are generally confined to a convergence to the nearest minimum. This problem is overcome by the use of a GA, which is based on stochastic search strategies and can explore large, multidimensional parameter spaces for global minima. In the near of the global minimum, however, convergence rates slow down. Here, more efficient downhill methods, starting with the best parameter vectors from the GA, are superior. In the present optimization problem, the con- centration of an additional, non-measurable surface species had to be calculated numerically within the differential equation system. This prevented any efficient and reliable use of gradient search techniques such as Newton or Powell methods, since they require the symbolic coding of derivatives of the differential equations. The straightforward, although less efficient, gradientless simplex method was used instead. The results of an optimization run were judged on the basis of the final residuals obtained, the physical plausibility of parameter values, and their sensitiv- ity and temperature dependence. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic performance While the level of conversion was nearly constant at 873 K over a period of 15 h, deactivation was more rapid at 923 K (see Fig. 1 ). In order to suppress the influence of deactivation on the kinetic results, kinetic data were acquired within the first hour of time-on-stream, where deactivation phenomena lay inside the range of accuracy, even for the highest temperature. Catalyst regeneration by oxidative treatment usually resulted in complete restoration of catalytic activity within two hours. Xc2n6201~ l 0 ~>~, ....

Kinetic data The reaction products of ethane aromatization were mainly aromatic hydrocar- bons, ethylene, methane, and molecular hydrogen. The distribution among aro- matics typically amounted to 40-50 tool.-% benzene, 20-30% toluene, <5% xylenes and C9-aromatics, and 10-20% naphthalene and its methyl derivatives. This distribution was only slightly dependent on temperature, but not significantly dependent on contact time or conversion, respectively. Higher aliphatic hydrocar- bons were produced only in traces, their sum of selectivities always being below 3 %. The only higher aliphatic product present in quantifiable amounts was propene; propane and butenes were also observed in extremely low concentrations in the chromatograms, but a quantification was not possible. Higher aliphatic C5 + hydro- carbons were not detected. Partial pressure profiles of ethane, the sum of aromatics, ethylene, propene, methane, and hydrogen, are shown in Figs. 2-7. The aromatics yield reached 38.3% at 923 K and a conversion of 5 ! %. The ethylene yield passed through a maximum with contact time.

The main products were ethylene and hydrogen, some aromatics and methane (~ Si < 10%) were also observed. Increasing the hydrogen pressure while keeping PC2H6 constant (Fig. 9), causes a decrease in ethylene formation rate. A small amount of methane is also produced here, the formation rate being well below the ethylene formation rate and not significantly depending on hydrogen pressure. 3.3. Reaction scheme The evaluation of the kinetic data obtained requires a kinetic reaction scheme, consisting of reaction pathways between the reactants observed. In this paragraph, a reaction scheme will be derived, which describes the phenomena observed in ethane aromatization in sufficient detail (Fig. 10). The reactants observed were ethane, ethylene, propene, the aromatics, and meth- ane, their concentration curves, plotted vs. contact time (cf.

Since their distribution did not depend on contact time, the aromatics were treated as a lumped pseudo-component. 3.3.1. Ethane conversion (j = 1) From the initial selectivity, i.e., plotting product selectivity versus ethane con- version and extrapolating towards X(22H6 = 0, conclusions can be drawn whether a product is formed from primary or secondary reactions. From Fig. 11 it can be derived that ethylene is a primary kinetic product, while the other products are formed from consecutive reactions. The measurements made under differential conversion conditions further support that ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene is the first step in ethane aromatization, in compliance with literature [ 19].

Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 dynamics require that Qj = Kj/II, p~'~> 1 for each reaction j, in order to proceed in the forward direction (Kj is the equilibrium constant). For ethane dehydrogenation, values higher than 3 were observed, indicating that the equilibrium was never reached. 3.3.2. Ethylene formation and conversion (j = 2) The maximum of ethylene partial pressure (cf. Fig. 3) indicates that ethylene is an intermediate. According to the carbenium ion theory, ethylene is subject to an oligomerization/isomerization/cracking cycle, which could, in principle, lead to a vast of alkene isomers with various carbon numbers. These reactions are known to proceed very fast at the high temperature applied. According to Haag [ 41 ], a partial equilibrium among the alkenes is rapidly established at least among C3 + alkenes; Iglesia et al. [ 23 ], even observed a statistical redistribution of labeled carbon atoms in the products of 1-13C-propane aromatization, indicating that the reactions among alkenes are much faster than the formation of aromatics. These findings, together with quantitative equilibrium calculations performed by Norval et al. [ 42 ], explain why (1) propene is observed, although it cannot form directly by alkylation of ethylene, and (2) the concentrations of higher alkenes are undetectably low. Sum- marizing, one may conclude that ethylene, although it probably dimerizes to a butene in the first step, ultimately yields a 'pool' of mutually equilibrated alkenes; for thermodynamic reasons [42], propene is the only measurable member of this pool. The alkene pool can be treated as a lumped kinetic component. At higher contact times, the presently observed Q2 values only slightly higher than 1 indicate that even the equilibrium between ethylene and the higher alkene pool is nearly attained. 3.3.3. Aromatization of the higher alkenes (i = 3) Members of the alkene pool can form aromatics by cyclization and dehydroge- nation. For aromatization, which proceeds via cyclization and several hydrogen abstraction steps, alkenes with at least 6 carbon atoms are required. According to the above-mentioned argument for the fast equilibration of the alkene pool, the overall stoichiometric step yields aromatics from the observed propene. 3.3.4. Methane formation (j = 4) Methane formation by hydrodealkylation of aromatics under consumption of hydrogen can be excluded due to the observed constant composition of aromatics. Hydrodealkylation processes should lead to a higher formation rate of benzene, compared to toluene/xylenes; therefore, they should result in a decrease of the proportion of methyl aromatics with contact time. This, however, is contradictory to the actual observations. In contrast to the results obtained on Ga-H-ZSM-5, over platinum doped H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the proportion of methylaromatics decreases indeed with contact time, and a strong influence of the hydrogen concentration on the formation of methane was proven [ 13 ]. These findings in the catalytic behaviour O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 357 of platinum-exchanged H-ZSM-5 should make the consideration of hydrodealky- lation necessary, whereas it can be neglected for the reaction scheme over Ga-H- ZSM-5. The formation of methane by direct hydrogenolysis of ethane shall be discussed, although the initial methane selectivity was zero (Fig. 11 ), which could also be explained by the initial absence of hydrogen. The methane formation rate should in some way depend on the partial pressures of ethane or hydrogen. The differential data (Fig. 9), however, show that methane formation does not depend significantly on hydrogen pressure, moreover, the methane formation rates are well below those calculated from the integral runs. This suggests that methane is not directly formed from ethane, a conclusion also arrived at for ethane aromatization on Zn-ZSM-5 [43]. In contrast to this, certain cracking reactions are indeed capable of producing methane, e.g. carbonium-ion type cracking [21]. This reaction requires higher (C3 +) hydrocarbons only contained in the above mentioned alkene pool. It was therefore assumed that methane originates from species of the equilibrated alkene pool. Finally, methane can be regarded as a final product; it is virtually inert under the conditions of ethane aromatization [44]. The overall stoichiometry of the kinetic reaction steps, referring to the kinetic reaction scheme shown in Fig. 10, are presented in (Eqs. 4-7). C2H6=C2H4+H2 3C2H4= 2C3H6 ~C3H6--CaHb(lumped aromatic hydrocarbon) -~ -- (2a-b) 2 C3H6 + 3H2 = 3CH4 (4) (5) H2 (6) (7) 3.4. Kinetic rate expressions Bifunctional catalysis is widely accepted to be effective in hydrocarbon catalysis over doped H-ZSM-5 [22], and was also presumed by Lukyanov [34,35] for his formulation of aromatization kinetics. The classical picture comprises redox sites (provided by the dopant) which are responsible for hydrogenation/dehydrogena- tion reactions, and acid sites (provided by the zeolite) necessary for hydrocarbon transformations like oligomerization, cracking, isomerization, and hydride transfer. 3.4.1. Dehydrogenation of ethane For the dehydrogenation of ethane, the gallium component is required, since conversion is low over H-ZSM-5 [ 19], and adsorption of ethane on H-ZSM-5 was not observed above 673 K [45]. A sequence of elementary steps, leading to the formation of ethylene and hydrogen on the gallium sites (G), is presented in Eqs. 8-12. An equivalent sequence for the dehydrogenation of propane on ZnO/silicalite 358 O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 was formulated by Wan et al. [ 30]. Elementary steps include adsorption of ethane, stepwise dissociation of hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon, and desorption of ethylene and molecular hydrogen. C2H6 q- G ~ C2H6 - G CzH6-G+G ~ C2Hs-G+H-G CRHs-G+G ~- C2H4-G+H-G C2H4 - G ~ C2H4 q- G 2H-G ~- H2+2G (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) To simplify the kinetic analysis, one step can be assumed rate-determining, while the others are assumed to be equilibrated. Transient measurements in the TAP reactor [45] revealed that adsorption of ethane on Ga-H-ZSM-5 is an activated process, significantly slower compared to the adsorption of ethane on the acid sites of H-ZSM-5, observed at temperatures below 673 K. Since the first step of the above scheme of elementary steps is a purely physical adsorption which involves no bond breaking, whereas the second step represents dissociative chemisorption, the latter is more likely the activated and slow surface interaction step observed in the TAP experiments. However, for the following steps (further dissocation, prod- uct desorption), it cannot be excluded that one of them may be rate-determining. Therefore, the 4 possible rate equations were formulated and compared by fitting to the differential data. The fitting results lead to the conclusion that (Eq. 9) is most likely to be rate-determining. The corresponding rate equation is: IOc~H~O. rI = k, PCzH6( {~vacant)G : - k_ c c (13) Together with the balance equation for gallium sites: l__ G OG2H4 _.1._ OHG _1_ G G -- Ov .... t + OC2H~ + OC2H6 (14) a Hougen-Watson type equation can be formulated. However, the adsorption con- stants for the Cell5 and C2H6 species were not significant, i.e., the particular adsorp- tion terms were small compared to unity. This means that the respective coverages are low, what is reasonable considering that C2H6 is not a chemisorbed species, and assuming that the equilibrium in (Eq. 10) lies on the product side. The Hougen- Watson rate equation can thus be simplified by neglecting the corresponding terms in the denominator. The final rate equation used is: 1 /)C2H6 -- KIIPC2H4 PH2 rl =k~ (15) ( 1 + K~C2H4 PC2H4 q- ~-~-H: PH2 ) 2 where K~ is the overall gas-phase equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of ethane. O.P. Keipert et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 359 3.4.2. Ethylene conversion Ethylene is further converted on the acid sites of the zeolite to an alkene of the above mentioned 'pool'. It is assumed that bimolecular oligomerization reactions occur via an Eley-Rideal type mechanism requiring a single acid site, rather than the via the improbable reaction between two electrophilic, positively charged car- benium ions adsorbed on adjacent sites [34,46]. Since ethylene is the predominant alkene observed, the forward reaction of step 2 includes dimerization of ethylene on acid sites of the zeolite (Z): z r2 = k2I~C2H4Pc2H4 (16) For establishing the adsorption term (denominator), all unsaturates, i.e., all alkenes and the aromatics, should principally be considered to adsorb on the acid sites of the zeolite. In the course of the fitting procedure, however, significant values for the adsorption constants could be determined only for aromatics, but not for ethylene and propene. This reflects the situation that the coverages of ethylene and propene on acid sites are low in comparison to the coverage of aromatics, which is supported by adsorption studies using the TAP reactor [ 45 ]. Therefore, for ethylene and propene, KiZpi << 1, and the adsorption term for reactions on the acid sites becomes 1 + KZrPAr, from what follows that F2 = ' 2 k2Pc2H4/( 1 q- KZrPAr), with the lumped kinetic constant k'2 = k2KZ2H4The backward reaction in step 2, i.e. cracking of C4 isomers, involves a single acid site, too, so that the adsorption term is also of first order with respect to the alkene-pool component. Although C4 alkenes them- selves were not observed, the fact that they are in equilibrium with propene suggests that the backward reaction rates should depend on the partial pressure of propene raised to some power. According to Boudart [47], the exponents for this kind of mass action law can be found regarding the overall stoichiometry ( (Eq. 5). Namely, the exponents in forward and backward reactions for each component i are related by c7,. - di = vi/s, where s is the stoichiometric number of the rate determining step in a reaction sequence, i.e., the number of times that the rate determining step must be repeated, in order to obtain, after summation of all elementary steps, the overall stoichiometric reaction. For reaction 2, the rate determining step consumes two ethylene molecules, therefore is must be repeated 1.5 times to obtain the overall stoichiometry, which means that s= 1.5. For ethylene, since UC2H4= --3 and ~c2m = 2, it follows for the backward reaction that ~C2H4 = 0. For propene, Uc~n~ = 2 and c3,~ = 0, therefore, ~c.m~= 4/3. The rate equation is herewith, K2 being the equilibrium constant for reaction step 2 ( (Eq. 5): __4/3 2 DC3H6 PC2H4 K2/3 r2 = k'2- (17) 1 q- KZr PAr Once they are formed, higher alkenes can further couple with ethylene [34,45 ], which would lead to further reaction pathways, e.g. to ethylene-propene coupling: __ Z Z r2b -- kzb ( OC2H4 PC3H6 or OC3H6 PCzH4) ( 1 8 ) 360 O.P. Keipert et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 34~365 However, for the present work, taking into account reaction 18 did not improve the fitness. The parameter k2b was not statistically significant, the reaction 18 was therefore neglected. 3.4.3. Alkene aromatization Those hydrocarbons within the alkene pool with six or more carbon atoms can undergo dehydrogenation to aromatics. Over H-ZSM-5 at the high temperature applied, aromatization by hydrogen transfer to other unsaturates does not play an appreciable role [ 33,48,49], what is reflected by the fact that almost no C3 + alkanes were observed. The question arises on what kind of site the aromatization takes place and by what mechanism the molecular hydrogen is rejected into the gas phase. It is well-known that, to form aromatics from C3 + aliphatics, gallium is not nec- essary [50]. So the dehydrogenation steps are assumed to proceed on the acid sites of the zeolite. According to Iglesia et al. [23], hydrogen is not released into the gas-phase immediately, but resides on the zeolite surface; on H-ZSM-5, its recom- binative desorption is a rate-determining step and leads to high surface fugacities. With the introduction of gallium, the surface hydrogen can spill over to the gallium sites and desorb from there, this significantly lowers surface fugacities and accel- erates aromatization. According to the definition of spillover [51], the process described here refers to back (or reverse) spillover; this effect was also discussed by other authors [24,26] to take place in aromatization. Considering that the sites adsorbing the surface hydrogen (Sp) may differ from the acid sites where the hydrocarbons are adsorbed [52], the aromatization of a hydrocarbon CnH2, may C,,H2n - Z + Sp C,zH2~ - 1 - Z q- Sp CnH2n- 2 - Z ~- Sp CnH2n 3 - Z + Sp CnH2~ 4- Z + Sp CnH2n - 5 - Z + Sp consist of the following elementary steps. CnH2n - 1 -- Z + H - Sp (19) CnH2n 2-Z+H-Sp (20) CnH2n 3-Z+H-Sp (21) C.,H2. 4-Z+H-Sp (22) C,,H2._5-Z+ H- Sp (23) C ~H2., 6 - Z (aromatic hydrocarbon) + H- SP (24) In [ 34], it was found that diene formation is the slowest in the dehydrogenation chain; this suggests that either reaction 19 or 20 are rate-determining. In this work, assuming reaction 20 rate-determining yielded the significantly better results. The rate equation thus becomes: b /~iZ I'~ISp -- L I'~1Z I'~ISP ( 25 ) r3 ~ t'~3~'JCnH2n - 1 *'J vacant ix_ 3'~JCnH2n_ 2'~JH Since all previous and subsequent hydrogen abstraction steps are equilibrated, the unknown surface concentrations of @c,,H2,- 1 and ,H2,,-2 can be substituted by O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 361 the surface concentrations of the alkene (,H2,) and the aromatic hydrocarbon (.n2n 6), respectively. Note that a cyclization step was not explicitly included: it is far from clear in which stage of the dehydrogenation cyclization actually occurs. Cyclization of the diene was claimed to be a fast reaction [34], but thermal cyclization of the trienes was also discussed [53]. If the cyclization step is also in quasi-equilibrium, its equilibrium constant is simply lumped into the rate constants, together with the equilibrium constants of the other equilibrated steps. Considering --0 ..... t-I-p, this leads to the the balance equation for the spillover sites, 1- Sp equation -- t Z (1--oSp)2 k' Oz.

Since all aromatics were lumped to a single component, two additional points have to be noticed. ( 1 ) The lumped aromatic has a mean carbon number of a, which is also the mean chain-length of the aromatic-forming pool alkene. The above-displayed equilibrium relation with regard to propene has to be modified, and becomes ,~z a/3- 1. OC,rt2, in (Eq. 26). CaH2a CC t~C3H~pc3H6 This expression replaces z (2) The elementary step (Eqs. 19-24) assumes that six hydrogen atoms are removed for the formation of an aromatic. Due to the formation of naphthalene, this value is actually somewhat higher. The exact value is 2a-b (refer to (Eq. 6), which leads to a correction of the exponent values 4 and 5 in (Eq. 26). With this, the final rate equation for step 3 becomes: _a/3 (1 -- HP) 2 KAr PAr (p) (2a-- b) -- 1 r3 = k' - /)C3H6 kv (27) 31 + KArPar p --31+KArPAr(l__OSP)(2a b)--2 3.4.4. Methane formation The mechanism concerning the formation of methane from the pool alkenes remains somewhat speculative in literature. On the one hand, carbonium ion crack- ing is possible, but requires a terminal CH3-group in the alkene as well as a zeolite H+. On the other hand, it is discussed that the surface hydrogen is consumed in methane formation [ 23]. In the following rate equation, r4 is assumed to depend on the concentration of the pool alkenes as well as on the surface hydrogen con- centration. The mean chain length of the methane producing pool alkenes, however, is unknown, but again an equilibrium relation with propene can be established. This is equivalent to assuming a fractional reaction order m as a kinetic parameter. Because methane is inert under the aromatization conditions, its formation is an irreversible reaction. r4 = k' P~3H6 p ( 28 ) 41 q-- KArPAr 362 O.P.

Back-spillover In some of the above equations, the coverage of the surface hydrogen species occurs. This species can only desorb after back-spillover to a gallium site: Sp-H+G ~ Sp+G-H (29) Since no assumption can be made whether aromatization or hydrogen spillover is rate-determining, another equation referring to the back-spillover step must be set up: __ Sp ~ _~ ~Sp ~G (30) rl3sp -- kBSpI~H [~vacant ~Sp\"Jv .... t\"JH The equations for r3, r4, and rBsp, contain p as an additional variable. Its value, however, is determined by the condition that, at the steady state, the production of surface hydrogen must be balanced by its consumption. Taking into account the stoichiometry of the particular steps, the balance equation is (2a - b)r3 - 6r4- rBsp = 0 (31) This equation has to be solved for p, what cannot be achieved analytically. Therefore, a numerical solution applying the bisection method [40] was used. The interval used for bracketing the variable p was (0; 1 ). 3.5. Parameter estimation The model used for parameter estimation thus contains 10 parameters: 6 rate constants: k't, k'2, k'3, k4, kBsp, ksp; 3 adsorption constants:/~c2n4, K~.2, KZr, and the exponent m. The rate constant k'_ 3 is determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the overall stoichiometry of step 3 (Eq. 6). The estimated values of the para- meters are listed in Table 1. The adsorption constants lead to significant coverage of the gallium and acid sites, respectively; values of up to 0.9 are calculated for O.P. Keipert et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 347-365 363 aromatics on acid sites. The calculated adsorption enthalpies are negative in accor- dance with van't Hoff's law. The negative pseudo activation energies observed for t ! ! r the constants k2, k3, and k4 are caused by the lumping of constants. For k2, the pseudo activation energy is a sum of the intrinsic activation energy and a (negative) adsorption constant. For k'3 and k4 the sum further contains the negative reaction enthalpy for the formation of higher hydrocarbons from propene. Considering these correlations, the resulting values of activation energies and adsorption enthalpies appear reasonable from a physico-chemical point of view. The partial pressures of the reaction components are well described taking into account the experimental errors, which depend on the order of magnitude of the concentration. Hence, the deviations between experimental and simulated data, especially for ethylene and propene, are relatively high due to the low concentration of these intermediates. 3.6. Conclusions The aromatization of ethane over Ga-H-ZSM-5 can be modeled kinetically on the basis of a 4-step reaction scheme comprising the five gas-phase components ethane, ethylene, propene (which was regarded as a representative of a pool of mutually equilibrated higher olefins), a lumped aromatic pseudocomponent, and methane. The reaction sequence consists of the initial dehydrogenation of ethane, further conversion of ethylene to higher alkenes and their ultimate aromatization. Methane as a side product is formed by cracking of higher alkenes rather than by hydrogenolysis of ethane or hydrodealkylation of aromatics. The kinetic model is based on a bifunctional concept including the presence of gallium sites as well as of acid sites of the zeolite. Ethane is dehydrogenated on the gallium sites, while alkene interconversion by oligomerization and cracking as well as aromatics for- mation proceed on the acid sites of the zeolite. Here, the model accounts for the formation of surface hydrogen on the zeolite, which is not desorbed directly, but after back-spillover to the gallium sites.

The kinetics of the catalytic ethane aromatization over Ga-(3 wt.-%) H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=15) were investigated in a catalytic fixed-bed micro reactor under atmospheric pressure. Reaction temperatures were 873, 898, and 923 K; inlet partial pressures ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 bar for ethane and from 0.1 to 0.7 bar for hydrogen. The aromatization reaction was described by a 4-step reaction scheme, comprising the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons via the subsequent formation of ethylene and higher alkenes, and the formation of methane as a side product of cracking. The kinetic model takes into account the bifunctionality of the catalyst by assuming gallium sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane and acid sites for alkene interconversion and aromatics formation. The latter proceeds with the formation of surface hydrogen on the zeolite, which can only desorb after a back-spillover step to the gallium sites.

        "dc:description": "The kinetics of the catalytic ethane aromatization over Ga-(3 wt.-%) H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=15) were investigated in a catalytic fixed-bed micro reactor under atmospheric pressure. Reaction temperatures were 873, 898, and 923 K; inlet partial pressures ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 bar for ethane and from 0.1 to 0.7 bar for hydrogen. The aromatization reaction was described by a 4-step reaction scheme, comprising the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons via the subsequent formation of ethylene and higher alkenes, and the formation of methane as a side product of cracking. The kinetic model takes into account the bifunctionality of the catalyst by assuming gallium sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane and acid sites for alkene interconversion and aromatics formation. The latter proceeds with the formation of surface hydrogen on the zeolite, which can only desorb after a back-spillover step to the gallium sites.",
