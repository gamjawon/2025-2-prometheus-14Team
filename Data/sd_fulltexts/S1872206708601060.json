DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60106-0 Pt/La-Ba-Al 2 O 3 /H-ZSM-5 Catalyst for Treating Hydrogen- Powered Vehicle Exhaust ZHENG Lingmin, LIU Zhimin, ZHU Qingchao, LI Yile, YU Quanwei, CHEN Yaoqiang, GONG Maochu* Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology of the Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: La-Ba-Al 2 O 3 (LBA) was prepared by the peptizing method, and Pt/LBA and Pt/LBA/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by im- pregnation. The catalyst activity for NO removal from the exhaust of a hydrogen-powered vehicle was evaluated. The specific surface area and pore volume of LBA were 144 m 2 /g and 0.45 ml/g, respectively. X-ray diffraction results showed that LBA had a -Al 2 O 3 structure and good thermal stability. The Pt/LBA/H-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited excellent performance in the selective catalytic reduction of NO between 106 and 356 ºC with a maximum NO conversion of 98.8% at 153 ºC and N 2 selectivity of 81.3%. Key words: hydrogen-powered vehicle; platinum; nitric oxide; selective catalytic reduction; H-ZSM-5 zeolite; monolith catalyst � Hydrogen is a cleaner transportation fuel than hydrocarbons because it is carbon free and has excellent combustion char- acteristics [1]. Researchers at vehicle manufacturers like BMW and Ford have found that a hydrogen-fueled engine produced only traces of CO and unburned hydrocarbons from the com- bustion of lubricating oil [2]. There are emissions of a high level of NO when the engine load is high, and slight fuel en- richment causes a higher combustion temperature [3]. The NO x emission from the hydrogen internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE) needs to be treated. In order to meet the stricter regulations, most H 2 ICE-pow- ered vehicles operate with stoichiometric ( = 1) mixtures and with small amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). They use a three-way catalytic converter (TWC) to reduce NO using hydrogen present in the exhaust [2]. The exhaust temperature of H 2 ICE-powered vehicles is from 200 to 500 ºC [4]. Much attention has been paid to hydrogen selective catalytic reduc- tion (SCR) of NO x at low temperatures (< 200 ºC) [5,6]. Only a few publications have considered the emissions of H 2 ICE- powered vehicles [2]. It is known that Pt-based catalysts are active for NO reduction by H 2 . Cumaranatunge et al. [7] used NH 3 as a hydrogen carrier and reported that Pt-based catalysts had high N 2 selectivity (S N2 ) for NH 3 reacting with NO x . In the present study, two catalysts were prepared to treat NO, and the byproduct NH 3 was used as an intermediate reductant to en- hance S N2 over the Pt catalyst with H-ZSM-5. La-Ba-Al 2 O 3 (LBA, 3 wt% La, 3 wt% Ba) was prepared by the peptizing method using La(NO 3 ) 3 , (CH 3 COO) 2 Ba, and boehmite as the precursors. LBA was calcined at 1000 ºC for 5 h. The Pt-based catalysts were prepared by impregnation of LBA with H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution. The sample was calcined in air at 550 ºC for 2 h to form two kinds of powder Pt1 and Pt2. Pt1 was ball-milled with distilled water to form a slurry that was coated onto a cordierite (62 cell/cm 2 , Corning, China) support. The coated cordierite was calcined in air at 550 ºC for 2 h, and monolith catalyst A (Pt/LBA) with 0.72 g/L Pt was obtained. Monolith catalyst B (Pt/LBA/H-ZSM-5) with 0.72 g/L Pt was prepared by the same method with a mechanical mixture of Pt2 and H-ZSM-5 (Tianjin Fusheng Dyestuff Plant, China). The catalyst washcoat loading on the cordierite was 140 mg/ml. The specific surface area analysis of the samples was carried out by the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method using an Autosorb-ZXF-06 analyzer (Xibei Chemical Institute, China). The samples were evacuated for 3 h at 400 ºC. The N 2 adsorp- tion/desorption isotherms were measured at liquid N 2 tem- perature. The specific surface areas of LBA and H-ZSM-5 were 144 and 235 m 2 /g, and the pore volumes were 0.45 and 0.18 ZHENG Lingmin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(5): 381–383 ml/g, respectively. LBA had a high surface area and large pore volume, and therefore it can be used as the catalyst support. The crystal phases of LBA were analyzed on a Philips X-ray diffraction apparatus using Cu K . radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The samples were scanned from 2 = 10 o to 90 o . Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of LBA. All the diffraction peaks from the sample were due to -Al 2 O 3 . No .-Al 2 O 3 and / -Al 2 O 3 were detected. This showed that LBA had good thermal stability after calcination at 1000 ºC for 5 h. The catalytic activity was evaluated in a multiple fixed-bed continuous flow microreactor by passing a gas mixture that is similar to the exhaust from a hydrogen-powered vehicle using mass flow controllers. The reactant gas was composed of 0.1% NO, 0.8% H 2 , and 0.5% O 2 in Ar. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 3 × 10 4 h 1 . The inlet and outlet gases were ana- lyzed by a five-component analyzer FGA-4100 (Foshan Analytical Instrument Company, China) for NO and a GC 2000 gas chromatograph (Shanghai Institute of Computing Technology, China) for N 2 and H 2 . The NH 3 was analyzed by an NH 3 analyzer (Shenzhen Jianda Science and Technology Company, China). The catalytic activity was evaluated by the NO conversion and the selectivity for products N 2 and NH 3 . Fig. 2 shows the conversion and selectivity over catalysts A and B at different temperatures. Fig. 2(a) shows that a high NO conversion (>80%) over catalyst B was obtained from 106 ºC to 304 ºC, and the NO conversion was significantly influenced by the temperature. It can be seen that with increasing tem- perature, the NO conversion increased at first, reached a maximum at 153 ºC, and then decreased. Compared with catalyst A, catalyst B showed the higher NO conversion in the temperature range of 153 to 304 ºC with a maximum of 98.8% at 153 ºC. Catalyst B had almost the same conversion as cata- lyst A at 356 ºC. Above 356 ºC, catalyst B showed poorer performance. Fig. 2(b) shows the consumption of hydrogen over catalysts A and B. From 106 to 153 ºC, the consumption of H 2 over the two catalysts increased sharply with increasing temperature, and H 2 -SCR was the major reaction. The H 2 was almost entirely consumed above 153 ºC, as the reactions H 2 -SCR and H 2 + 1/2O 2 = H 2 O occurred at the same time. NO conversion increased with the H 2 consumption. The highest NO conversion was observed at 153 ºC. Xu et al. [8] reported that the surface of Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was completely covered by N adatoms at 150 ºC. This corresponded closely to the maximum in NO conversion. Frank et al. [9] suggested that adsorbed hydrogen can displace molecularly adsorbed NO, leading to a decrease in NO cov- erage. Then H 2 -SCR can occur. When the temperature was high enough, adsorbed H reacted with N adatoms, and the NO conversion was the highest. Higher temperatures were unfa- vorable for H 2 -SCR. The adsorbed H reacted with O 2 at higher temperatures in reaction H 2 + 1/2O 2 = H 2 O [10]. Further in- creases in the temperature led to decreasing coverages of both N and H [8]. Only a small fraction of the H 2 was used for the conversion of NO. Frank et al. [9] found that NO dissociation also depended on the partial pressure of H 2 , and the minimum 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 J J J J J In tensity 2 T/( o ) Fig. 1.

Conversion and selectivity as a function of temperature for NO reduction by H 2 over catalysts A (Pt/LBA) and B (Pt/LBA/ H-ZSM-5). Reaction conditions: 0.1% NO, 0.8% H 2 , 0.5% O 2 in Ar. ZHENG Lingmin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(5): 381–383 partial pressure of H 2 was less at higher temperatures. There- fore, NO conversion decreased with a further increase in temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 2(c), the production of byproduct NH 3 depended on the temperature. NH 3 was observed between 106 and 356 ºC over the two catalysts. It was not seen above 356 ºC. Xu et al. [8] noticed that adsorbed N species can react with adsorbed H to form NH 3 . Clayton et al. [6] showed that am- monia decomposition occurred at temperatures exceeding 350 ºC. Pt is also a catalyst to decompose ammonia. S NH3 reached a maximum of 21.3% at about 204 ºC over catalyst A, but the formation of NH 3 over catalyst B was negligible. Fig. 2(d) revealed that there was higher S N2 over the two catalysts. S N2 increased with increasing temperature from 106 to 356 ºC. In this temperature range, the selectivity for N 2 O and NH 3 de- creased with increasing temperature [8]. S N2 over catalyst B was higher than that over catalyst A between 106 and 356 ºC while S NH3 was lower than that over catalyst A. Clayton et al. [11] showed that there are two competing routes to obtain N 2 . One is the direct production from H 2 and adsorbed NO x . The other is that H 2 and adsorbed NO x form NH 3 first, and then the remaining adsorbed NO x is reduced by NH 3 to form N 2 . H-ZSM-5 has a uniquely high activity and selectivity for the SCR of NO with NH 3 . Its unique environ- ment of cationic sites gives unusual interactions between re- actants and catalytic sites [12]. Based on this, the production of NH 3 may be desirable in applications that utilize combined H 2 - SCR and ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH 3 -SCR). The NH 3 formed can be used as an intermediate reductant to enhance S N2 . It was found that there were clear relationships between NO conversion, S NH3 , and S N2 over catalyst B. S NH3 decreased from 106 to 356 ºC, while the NO conversion and S N2 were enhanced. This observation can be explained by that the addition of H-ZSM-5 increased S N2 by its use of the by- product NH 3 as a secondary reductant. In summary, a maximum NO conversion of 98.8% was ob- served at 153 ºC with a S N2 of 81.3% over catalyst B. The catalyst showed high activity (NO conversion > 80%) and S N2 (> 70%) in the temperature range of 153–304 ºC. The catalytic performance was promoted by adding H-ZSM-5 as an NH 3 -SCR catalyst. The Pt/LBA/H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed good potential for treating hydrogen-powered vehicle exhaust. References 1 Hoekstra R L, Collier K, Mulligan N, Chew L.
