Multifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital to develop energy conversion and storage devices. In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we have investigated the HER, OER and ORR catalytic activities of a series of transition atoms (including Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) anchored on square graphyne (TM@S-GPY). Our results revealed that the Ni@S-GPY can act as a promising trifunctional catalyst for HER/OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V, while Pt@S-GPY and Ir@S-GPY can be utilized as eligible bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively. In addition, Pd@S-GPY exhibits high catalytic activity for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. Especially, depending on their diverse electronic properties, the catalytic activity of these SACs can be well rationalized by their optimal binding strengths with reaction intermediates. Thus, S-GPY is an ideal support for immobilizing single atom catalysts to design stable and highly-efficient multifunctional catalysts in various electrochemical processes.

Keywords Density functional theory Square graphyne Multifunctional single atom electrocatalysts Overpotential 1 Introduction To avoid disturbing the Earth's ecosystem, the balance between fast economic growth and environmental conservation has caught all human's attention. Currently, there is a critical requirement to develop energy conversion and storage devices which can provide renewable and pollution-free energy to substitute the traditional fossil fuels [1–3]. The water splitting system, metal-air cells, and unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC) have been investigated intensively as clean energy technologies due to their high energy conversion efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions [4,5]. However, the above energy-related devices are generally hampered by several critical electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), due to their high overpotentials [6,7]. Thus, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts to boost the above electrochemical process is of vital importance. In this regards, the platinum-based nanomaterials are regarded as the state-of-art electrocatalysts for HER and ORR [8–10], whereas RuO2 and IrO2 are widely used as the most active OER electrocatalysts [11–13]. However, the scarce resources, high price, and poor durability greatly hamper the large-scale applications of these noble-based materials. It is highly urgent to further develop effective and low-cost alternative electrocatalysts to replace these above noble metal materials. In comparison with the single electrocatalyst which can only catalyze one half-reaction, multifunctional electrocatalysts are more interesting due to high integrity and improved catalytic efficiency [14,15]. The newly developing single-atom catalysts (SACs), in which single metal atoms are dispersed on the support material and can work as active sites of the reaction, have become a hot star in electrocatalysis [16–27], including HER, OER, ORR, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), due to their high utilization of metal atoms, outstanding catalytic activity, and exceptional selectivity. To suppress the aggregation of metal atoms, great efforts have been made to search for suitable materials to immobilize SACs for ensuring their stability. Recent studies reveal that the two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials can be utilized as promising substrates due to their specific surface areas and tunable physiochemical properties [28,29], such as graphene, graphdiyne, carbon nitride (CxNy), and so on [6,28,30–41]. For example, Zhao et al. studied that single Ni atom anchored pyrazine-modified graphdiyne can possess highly-efficient HER/OER/ORR electrocatalytic activity [6]. While Zhai et al. reported that Mo embedded graphdiyne can perform as a promising NRR catalyst [39]. In addition, Gao and co-workers revealed that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) can strongly immobilize single Pt and Pd atoms, which can be utilized highly-efficient CO2RR [40] . Very recently, square graphyne (S-GPY) [42,43], as a novel 2D carbon nanomaterial, draw our attention, which contains C4 and C12 rings connected by an acetylene bond. Interestingly, the S-GPY exhibits highly antisotropic Dirac fermions, directional charge transport, and good conductivity [42], which may be beneficial for their immobilizing SACs to develop advanced electrocatalysts. Inspired by the unique pore structure and diverse properties, in this work, a series of single metal atoms were anchored on S-GPY (TM@S-GPY, TM = Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) as HER/OER/ORR catalysts. By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we found that the pristine S-GPY exhibits an unsatisfied catalytic performance for HER/OER/ORR with large overpotentials. After metal atoms anchoring on S-GPY, however, the catalytic activity of TM@S-GPY was enhanced to different degrees. Interestingly, Ni@S-GPY can act as a promising trifunctional catalyst for HER/OER/ORR with low overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V, while Pt@S-GPY and Ir@S-GPY can be used as eligible bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively, and Pd@S-GPY can exhibit high catalytic activity for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. Our results can provide useful guidance to further develop efficient and inexpensive multifunctional electrocatalysts in electrochemical processes. 2 Computational methods All the density functional theory (DFT) computations were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [44] with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [45,46]. A semi-empirical van der Waals (vdW) [47,48] correction by Grimme (DFT-D2) was applied to correct the dispersion interactions. The projector-augmented plane wave (PAW) [49,50] was performed to describe the electron-ion interactions. A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for the plane wave expansion according to our test (Table S1). All of the studied geometric structures were fully relaxed by adopting 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid k-points and their density of states (DOSs) are computed with 63 k-points. The convergence threshold was set as 10−4 eV in energy and 0.02 eV Å−1 in force. Both spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized computations were employed on the studied systems. The HER, OER and ORR performances were evaluated by the well-known computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model [51,52]. The computational details were presented in the Electronic supplementary information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure, electronic property and catalytic activity of pristine 4,12,4-square graphyne In this study, we mainly focused on the square graphyne allotrope, namely, 4,12,4-graphyne [42,43]. The one-atom-thick periodic carbon network is consisted of 4- and 12-member rings, where the two C rings are joined by an acetylene bond [42] ( Fig. 1a). The 4,12,4-graphyne belongs to the space group P4/m ( C 2 h 1 ), and the computed lattice parameter is a = 11.04 Å (Table S2), which are consistent with the earlier reports [42]. All the carbon atoms in the primitive cell of the square graphyne can be categorized into five groups (Fig. 1a): the atoms (labeled as C1) of S-GPY can directly form 4-member rings; another two sets of carbon atoms (C2 and C3) take part in the formation of 12-member rings, where the C2 atoms are at the corner of the 12-member rings and the remaining two kinds of atoms (C4 and C5) join to form acetylene chains. In addition, there exist six different bonds in the square graphyne: d 1 (1.47), d 2 (1.35), d 3 (1.24), d 4 (1.37), d 5 (1.41) and d 6 (1.23 Å), as shown in Fig. 1a and Table S2. Clearly, the computed bond lengths of C1-C1, C1-C4, C2-C3 and C2-C5 can be compared with that of graphene (1.42 Å), indicating the sp2 -like hybridizing bond character. While the bond lengths of C3-C3 and C4-C5 are close to that of acetylene (1.33 Å), which implies the sp-like hybridizing bond feature. There also exist some different bond angles in the square graphyne, which are 113.5°in 12-member rings and 90.0°in 4-member rings. It is obvious that the bond angles in 12-member rings and especially 4-member rings are deviated the value 120° in the normal sp2 hybridization, reflecting the existence of ring strain. Therefore, the carbon atoms in the 4- and 12-member rings could be more active than those of graphene. Furthermore, the computed band structure and DOS revealed that the square graphyne exhibits semimetallic characteristic with zero band gap (Fig. 1b). In particular, the square graphyne has been found to be a Dirac material with highly anisotropic Dirac crescent near the Fermi level. Notably, the aforementioned structure and properties of S-GPY are well consistent with previous studies [42], suggesting the accuracy of the adopted methods and models in this work. Subsequently, we evaluated the catalytic activity for HER/OER/ORR of the pristine square graphyne. As for HER, the adsorption free energy (ΔG H*) was computed, which can be viewed as a reliable indicator to evaluate the HER catalytic activity of a given catalyst [8,53–57]. To this end, H* adsorption on all possible nonequibrilm sites were considered, including five top sites over the C atoms (TC1∼TC5) and the correlative bridge sites over C-C bonds. It is noted that the adsorption of H* at the bridge sites is unstable, as it will tend to be optimized to the top sites after fully structure relaxation. As shown in Fig. S1 and Table S3, the computed results reveal that the ΔG H* values of TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4, and TC5 are ranging from 0.20 to 0.84 eV, which are higher than the state-of-art Pt catalyst (-0.09 eV) [8], thus indicating the poor catalytic performance of pristine S-GPY for HER. Next, we explored the OER catalytic activity for the square graphyne by computing ΔG of reaction intermediates on all possible sites of pristine S-GPY, including five top sites over the C atoms (TC1∼TC5) and the correlative bridge sites over C-C bonds. The results showed that OH* and OOH* is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the C atoms, While O* species prefer to be attached the bridge sites. As shown in Fig. S2, the four-step elementary reactions involved in the OER on C2, C3 and C5 sites are uphill in free energy at zero potential. The potential-determining steps (PDS) for the three C sites are the third elementary reaction step (i.e., O* + H2O → OOH* + H+ + e−) and the η OER are up to 1.81, 1.31, 1.05 eV, respectively, which are much larger than those of extensively employed IrO2 and RuO2, due to the weak OOH* binding on the three sites. The results demonstrate the graphyne allotrope possesses poor OER catalytic activity. The ORR can be considered as the reverse reaction of OER. As shown in Fig. S2, the formation of OOH* can serve as the potential-determining step (PDS) of ORR for C2, C3 and C5 sites of square graphyne with the overpotential (η ORR) of 1.58, 0.91, 0.81 V, which are much larger than that of Pt(111) catalysts (0.45 V) [58], suggesting that 4,12,4-graphyne also show inert ORR catalytic activity. Overall, the pristine square graphyne exhibit unsatisfied HER, OER, and ORR catalytic activity due to their larger overpotentials than noble-metal benchmarks. It is highly desirable to further enhance the catalytic activity of S-GPY. 3.2 The transition metal atoms anchored square graphyne To improve the catalytic activity of square graphyne, series of single transition metal atom (including Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) were anchored on its surface. After considering four different possible initial adsorption sites, including S1, S2, S3, and S4 (Fig. 1a), we found these TM atoms adsorbed at the center of the 12-member rings (S1) were more energetically favorable resulting in the formation of eight TM-C bonds except for Pt (Table S4). Almost all the TM@S-GPY structures can still maintain the planar configuration with the TM-C bond lengths in the range of 2.13–2.51 Å (Table S5). An exception is Sc atom, which can lead to the out-of-plane displacement due to its larger atomic radius. The computed lattice parameters (a, b) for the anchored square graphyne are in the range of 11.08–11.13 Å which can be comparable to those of pure square graphyne (a = b = 11.04 Å), revealing that the geometric structures of square graphyne almost have no change after doping with TM atoms. Indeed, the calculated C-C bond lengths in the anchored systems are close to that of pure square graphyne, as shown in Table S6. The Bader charges computations illustrated that electrons transferred from the TM atom to square graphyne are in the range of 0.29–1.58 |e|, suggesting the strong interactions between TM atom and C atoms. To assess the thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities of these TM@S-GPY, we computed their binding energies (E b) and dissolution potential (U diss) [58], which can be defined as E b = E TM@S-GPY - E S-GPY - E TM and U diss = U d i s s 0 (metal, bulk) - E b N e | e | , where E TM@S-GPY, E S-GPY and E TM are the total energy for the anchored square graphyne, sole square graphyne and metal atom, respectively; U d i s s 0 (metal, bulk) and N e denotes the standard dissolution potential (pH = 0) of pure bulk metal and the number of electrons in dissolution. According to the definitions above, the negative E b1 values (Table S6) suggest that it is more thermodynamically favorable for the TM atoms to bind with the square graphyne. We also compute the binding energy of the second anchoring TM atoms taking the magnetic coupling between TM atoms into consideration [59] . As shown in Table S6, the second anchoring TM atoms still display a small binding energy indicating that it is difficult for these TM atoms to agglomerate [38]. The positive U diss denotes that the TM atoms can anchore on substrate strongly rather than dissolve under the electrochemical conditions (Table S6). Overall, the computed negative E b1 and positive U diss ensure the stability of the anchored square graphyne under the electrochemical conditions. Besides, we took Ir@S-GPY and Ni@S-GPY as examples to investigate the thermodynamic stability of anchored systems at 300 and 500 K by employing the molecular dynamics simulation, where each simulation process lasts for 10ps with a time steps of 1fs. The computed results show that the two structures can maintain their original configurations, in which the TM atoms are still attached to the S-GPY, further confirming the high dynamic-stability of TM@S-GPY, as shown in Fig. S3. Furthermore, we investigated the electronic and magnetic properties for the composite TM@S-GPY systems. The computed DOSs revealed that all the TM atoms anchored S-GPY systems can exhibit the metallic behavior dominated by the corresponding states from C and TM atoms crossing the Fermi level (Fig. S4). Especially, the newly introduced TM states around the Fermi level in the PDOSs improve the density of carriers, endowing the anchored systems better conductivity, which is beneficial for the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, the effective hybridization for states of C and TM atoms indicates the strong interactions of TM atoms with square graphyne substrate, which is consistent with the Bader charges computations above. The spin-polarized computations indicate that TM@S-GPY systems (TM = Co, Cu, Rh, Ir and Pt) can be nonmagnetism, while other anchored S-GPY show ferromagnetism with the magnetic moments ranging from 0.6 to 3.4 μ B . 3.3 The HER/OER/ORR catalytic activities of TM@S-GPY After confirming the structures, stabilities and electronic properties of these single metal atoms anchored on S-GPY, we further evaluated their catalytic activities for HER/OER/ORR. Firstly, we investigated the HER catalytic activity of TM@S-GPY by computing ΔG H* of all the potential sites, including the top sites over TM and five kinds of C atoms (TTM, TC1-TC5). The results show that C5 atoms always exhibit smaller ΔG H* absolute values than other sites of TM@S-GPY. Especially, the C5 sites for Co, Ni, and Cu anchored S-GPY can exhibit considerably high HER catalytic activity and serve as the most active sites, due to their ultra-small ΔG H* value close to zero (-0.09, -0.07, 0.08 eV) ( Fig. 2 and Table S7). Some TM atoms themselves for TM@S-GPY can also present the ΔG H* values close to zero and serve as the most active catalytic sites, such as Sc (-0.05 eV), Ir (-0.07 eV) and Pt (-0.04 eV). Obviously, the composite TM@S-GPY systems exhibit higher HER catalytic activity than the pure S-GPY and other SACs in previous reports (Table S8), for which both C and TM atoms can serve as the most active sites with the ΔG H* values close to zero. As revealed by the charge density difference ( Fig. 3), the excellent HER catalytic activity of anchored S-GPY can be mainly ascribed to that the evident electron transfer between TM atoms and C atoms further enhances the interaction between the C and H atoms and activates the correlative catalytic sites. We also computed the theoretical exchange current density i 0 as a function of the ΔG H* value at pH = 0 basis on the equation: i 0 = -ek 0 1 1 + exp ( | ▵ G H * | / k b T ) , where k 0 stands for the rate constant and is equal to 1 [8,60]. As shown in Fig. 2b, some TTM and TC5 sites for TM anchored square graphyne with excellent HER catalytic performance, such as TSc-Sc@S-GPY, TIr-Ir@S-GPY, TPt-Pt@S-GPY, TC5-Ni@S-GPY, TC5-Co@S-GPY and TC5-Cu@S-GPY, are located at the peak of HER volcano curve. To examine the solvation effect, we have explored the HER catalytic activity for the correlative sites of TM@S-GPY by adopting the implicit solvation model implemented in VASPsol. The computed results are presented in Table S9. It can be found that all the computed ΔG H* values have little change between the two situations, indicating the negligible solvation effect on HER for TM@S-GPY. Besides, we have took Ni@GPY as example to investigate the HER mechanism by considering Tafel (i.e., 2H* → H2↑ + 2*) and Heyrovsky (i.e., H* + H3O+ + e− → H2↑ + H2O + *) reactions. As shown in the energy paths presented in Fig. S5, the energy barrier of Heyrovsky mechanism (1.03 eV) are smaller than that of Tafel mechanism (2.45 eV). Therefore, the Heyrovsky mechanism is more favorable for Ni@GPY. Furthermore, we explored the OER/ORR catalytic activities of these TM@S-GPY candidates by computing their overpotential (η OER/η ORR). The computed results indicated that the TM atoms can serve as active sites to bind all OER/ORR intermediates. As illustrated in free-energy diagrams of Figs. 4 and S6, the four elementary steps involved in OER for the TM@S-GPY systems are found to be uphill when U = 0 V except the Sc, Ti and Os atoms anchored square graphyne. The PDS of OER for seven TM atoms anchored square graphyne (including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pt, Ru) are the steps of OOH* species formation (i.e., O* + H2O → OOH* + H+ + e−) with the ΔG max of 2.96, 2.56, 2.12, 1.99, 1.66, 1.82, 2.05 eV, corresponding the η OER value of 1.73, 1.33, 0.89, 0.76, 0.43, 0.59, 0.82 V, respectively. Interestingly, the calculated η OER for Ni@S-GPY (0.43 V) is even smaller than the well-estabilished IrO2 catalyst (0.56 V), indicating its high OER catalytic activity. For other four TM atoms (Pd, Ir, Rh, Cu) anchored S-GPY, the potential-determining step should be the second elementary reaction step (i.e., OH* → O* + H+ + e−) in view of that the maximal Gibbs free-energy difference is between ΔG OH* and ΔG O*. As shown in Fig. 4, the computed η OER values on Pd, Ir, Rh anchored systems are 0.40, 0.36, 0.55 V, respectively, all of which can be smaller than or comparable to that of IrO2 (0.56 V) and some SACs proposed by previous reports (Table S10), suggesting their excellent OER catalytic activity. However, the calculated results reveal that the ΔG OH* value for Sc, Ti and Os are negative in the range of -1.69∼-0.47 eV, implying that the OH* can be strongly bonded on the TM atom. As a result, the PDS can be the fourth step of O2 release for Sc/Ti anchored S-GPY with the η OER 1.71 and 1.78 V, respectively and the third step of OOH* formation for the Os anchored systems with the η OER 1.19 V, all of which are larger than that of IrO2 (0.56 V), indicating the inert OER catalytic activity. Subsequently, we investigated the ORR catalytic activity for the anchored systems which can be viewed as a reverse reaction of OER by calculating the Gibbs free-energy difference between two elementary reaction steps to obtain overpotential (η ORR). As demonstrated in Figs. 4 and S6, the elementary reaction steps for ORR on the eleven TMs anchored S-GPY systems (TM = Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Pt/Ru/Sc/Ti/Os) are downhill at zero potential in free energy profiles, implying that the elementary reactions are all exothermic and the ORR process are feasible at zero potential. For the TM@S-GPY (TM = Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Pt/Ru), the PDSs of oxygen reduction reaction locate at the step of OH* hydrogenation due to the relatively strong interaction between OH* and the metal atoms. The ORR overpotentials (η ORR) are 1.12 (Cr), 0.88 (Mn), 1.17 (Fe), 1.01 (Co), 0.36 (Ni), 0.86 (Cu), 0.84 (Pt) and 0.90 V (Ru), respectively. The steps of OOH* species formation for Pd, Ir and Rh anchored S-GPY can act as the potential-determining step (PDS) of ORR in view of the weak binding strength of OOH*. The ORR overpotentials (η ORR) are 0.34 (Pd), 0.70 (Ir) and 0.87 V(Rh), respectively. Different from eleven TM atoms anchored S-GPY investigated above, the step of OH* hydrogenation to form H2O for Sc, Ti and Os anchored S-GPY systems is uphill in free energy profiles at zero potential, corresponding to the η ORR of 2.92, 2.67 and 1.70 V, respectively, which are all larger than 1.23 V. Overall, among all the TM atoms studied, Ni and Pd atoms anchored S-GPY exhibit excellent ORR catalytic activities due to their smaller η ORR (0.36, 0.34 V) than that of state-of-art Pt (0.45 V). Since the OER and ORR usually occur in water solution, we also explore the OER/ORR catalytic activity for the sampled systems (including Ni, Pd, Ir and Pt @S-GPY) by employing the implicit solvation model to examine the solvation effect. As shown in Table S11 and Fig. S7, the results reveal that η OER computed in solvation situation are smaller than or close to that in vacuum, implying the ignorable solvation effect for OER. The η ORR value in solvation situation for Pd and Ir@S-GPY are close to or smaller than that in vacuum. Particularly, the S-GPY anchored with Ir atom in solvation situation can exhibit higher ORR catalytic activity than that in vacuum. Consequently, the computed results indicate the negligible solvation effect on OER/ORR catalytic activity for TM@S-GPY. As shown in Figs. S8,–S10, we take Ni@GPY as example to investigate the ORR mechanisms: one is that O2 associate with H atom to form OOH and another is that O2 directly dissociate into O atoms, both of which can make the adsorbed O2 gradually hydrogenate into the product H2O. The O2 dissociation mechanism are favorable with the energy barriers of 1.24 eV which are smaller than that of O2 association mechanism (2.73 eV). As the OER can be considered as the reverse reaction of ORR, we take the reverse mechanism of ORR as the OER path to compute the activation barrier (3.08 and 2.41 eV). Based on the aforementioned results on HER/OER/ORR, we expected that Ni@S-GPY can perform as promising HER/OER/ORR trifunctional catalyst with overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V; Pt@S-GPY, and Ir@S-GPY as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively. Pd@S-GPY can also serve as bifunctional electrocatalyst for metal-air battery (OER/ORR) with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. 3.4 The catalytic activity origin of TM atoms anchored square graphyne for OER/ORR To better understand the excellent catalytic performance of TM@S-GPY, we explored the origin of OER/ORR catalytic activity on these candidates, which is significant to further design high-performance catalyst. The theoretical investigations revealed that the OER/ORR catalytic activity of material can be closely related to the binding strength of reaction intermediates, including OH*, O*, OOH* [61]. To this end, we computed the adsorption free energies of these oxygenated species on all TM@S-GPY candidates. As shown in Fig. 5, the obvious linear scaling relation-ships can be obtained between ΔG OOH* and ΔG OH* as well as ΔG O* and ΔG OH*, following the expression of ΔG OOH* = 0.83ΔG OH* + 3.20 and ΔG O* = 1.36ΔG OH* + 1.06 with large determination coefficient (R 2) of 0.97 and 0.90, respectively. According to previous reports, the difference value of adsorption free energy between OH* and O* (ΔG O* - ΔG OH*) for OER can be regarded as a descriptor to describe the OER catalytic activity for catalysts [62]. Thus, we examined the relationship between the value of ΔG O*-ΔG OH* and of OER overpotential (-η OER). As illustrated in Fig. 5, a volcano curve is plotted, from which we find that the anchored Ni, Pt, Ir, Pd, Rh atoms are located at the top of volcano curve, suggesting their high OER catalytic activities. As for ORR, the ΔG OH* value can serve as an indicator to measure the ORR activity of materials [62]. The computed ORR overpotential (-η ORR) as a function of ΔG OH* value was plotted. Interestingly, a volcano curve is also obtained, from which we found that the anchored Ni, Pd atoms with the η ORR value of 0.36 and 0.34 V are close to the peak of volcano curve, implying the excellent ORR catalytic activity. 4 Conclusion By means of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have investigated HER/OER/ORR catalytic performance for the square graphyne before and after anchoring single transition metal atoms. The following significant findings can be obtained: (1) The pristine square graphyne exhibit unsatisfied HER/OER/ORR catalytic performance. (2) The anchored S-GPY can exhibit higher HER catalytic activity, for which both the C and TM atoms can serve as the most active sites. The evident electron transfer between TM atoms and C atoms can further activate the correlative sites and improve the HER catalytic activity for anchored systems. (3) The Ni@S-GPY system can act as prospective HER/OER/ORR trifunctional catalysts with overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V, while Pt@S-GPY and Ir@S-GPY can be used as promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively. In addition, Pd@S-GPY can exhibit high catalytic activity for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. The OER/ORR overpotentials of these catalysts can be strongly associated with the energy (ΔG O* - ΔG OH*) and ΔG OH*. Overall, all these significant findings can provide new approaches to design high-efficiency multifunctional electroctalysts based on carbon-based materials, which can be helpful to promote the practical application of related materials in renewable and pollution-free energy systems.

Our results revealed that the Ni@S-GPY can act as a promising trifunctional catalyst for HER/OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.07/0.43/0.36 V, while Pt@S-GPY and Ir@S-GPY can be utilized as eligible bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (HER/OER) with overpotentials of 0.04/0.59 and 0.07/0.36 V, respectively. In addition, Pd@S-GPY exhibits high catalytic activity for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.40/0.34 V. Especially, depending on their diverse electronic properties, the catalytic activity of these SACs can be well rationalized by their optimal binding strengths with reaction intermediates. Thus, S-GPY is an ideal support for immobilizing single atom catalysts to design stable and highly-efficient multifunctional catalysts in various electrochemical processes.",
