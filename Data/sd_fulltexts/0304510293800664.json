(+39-50)918320 Abstract The homopolymerization of ethylene was investigated in the presence of a hafnium/titanium (1:1) catalyst supported on magnesium chloride and activated with triisobutylaluminum to which different Lewis bases (LB) were added in various molar ratios. All the investigated LB, i.e. dibutyl ether, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, tetramethylpiperidine, tetraethoxysilane, and phenyltriethoxysilane, show a similar behaviour: polymer yield, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution decrease with increasing the LB:transition metal molar ratio. However, distinct features are observed when changing the nature of the LB, as well as its amount. As far as the polymer yield is concerned, dibutyl ether and tetramethylpiperidine show the lowest and the highest decreasing effect, respectively. Dibutyl ether has very little effect on molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. By contrast, silanes cause a remarkable decrease of molecular weight when molar ratios LB/ (Ti +Hf) greater than 0.5 are used. Finally, tetramethylpiperidine gives strongly reduced molecular weight and molecular weight distribution when used at molar ratios appreciably lower than 0.5, while additional amounts do not have any further effect. These results are discussed in terms of possible selective interactions of different catalytic sites with the investigated LB. Key words: ethylene polymerization; hafnium/titanium; Lewis base; supported bimetallic catalyst Introduction Addition of Lewis bases (LB) during the preparation (internal LB) or the activation with aluminium alkyls (external LB) of supported, high activity Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been shown to have a great effect on polymerization performance [ 1,2 ] . In the case of 1-alkenes, propylene in particular, LB have been widely used to increase the isotactic stereospecificity of the catalyst, with excellent results. While the exact role of LB has not yet been fully clari- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 0 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 18 L. Barazzoni et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993)17-27 fied, most indications suggest that their main role is to modify the distribution of active sites in favour of the most atereospeciiic ones [ 3,4 ] . In the case of ethylene polymerization, LB can be envisaged to affect polymer productivity [ 5 ] , molecular weight distribution and, in the case of LLDPE, also comonomer sequence distribution. Indeed, the LB can react selectively with different sites, thus modifying their behaviour. Even more significant effects can be expected for bimetallic catalysts [6] (Ti-Hf) because of the wider distribution of sites and the possibility of having site based on just one (Ti or Hf) or both (Ti and Hf ) transition metals [ 7 ] . In the present work, bimetallic catalysts obtained by co-supporting hafnium and titanium on MgC12 were used in ethylene homopolymerization after activation with trialkylaluminum to which variable amounts of different Lewis bases (external bases) were added. The bases used contain oxygen [dibutyl ether (DBE), butyl acetate (BAc), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) ], nitrogen [tetramethylpiperidine (TMP) ] and silicon plus oxygen [tetramethoxysilane (TES) and phenyltriethoxysilane (PES) ] as heteroatoms. We evaluated the effect of these different compounds on polymer productivity, molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD ), as well as on the polymerization kinetics during the first two hours, with the aim of gaining information on active site type and distribution, as well as on the possibility of modifying the properties of the polyethylene formed. Experimental Materials Commercial grade Al (i-C4H9) 3 and polymerization grade ethylene were used without further purification. Research grade n-hexane was purified according to the usual procedure. The magnesium chloride supported catalyst, prepared according to procedures similar to those described previously [ 7 ] , has the following chemical composition: T11,pHf1_3Mg2.0A1o.85C112.45 Polymerization experiments A solution of 0.6 g of TIBA in 1800 ml of anhydrous n-hexane containing the Lewis base was placed in a 51 stainless steel reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture was heated at 75 C for about 15 min, and the reactor was then loaded with hydrogen up to 8 bar and ethylene up to 11 bar, in that order. Finally, a suspension of catalyst (0.077 mmol Ti and 0.10 mmol Hf) in 100 ml of anhydrous n-hexane was introduced into the reaction vessel by raising the ethylene pressure up to 12 bar. The pressure was kept constant for two hours by a continuous ethylene feed; the polymerization was then interrupted by adding 20 ml of a 10 wt.% solution of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol in ethanol. The coagulated polymer was filtered and dried under vacuum to constant weight. L. Barazzoni et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993)17-27 19 Polymer characterizations The melt index (MI) was measured using a plastometer ATS-FAAR Model 10.02 013 with a load of 5.0 kg, according to the ASTM-D1238 method. Shear sensitivity (SS) was evaluated as the ratio of MI values at 21.6 kg and 5 kg load, respectively. Density measurements were carried out in a density-gradient column according to the ASTM-D2839 procedure. Intrinsic viscosity measurements were performed using a Ubbelhode viscometer at 135 C in 1,2,4trichlorobenzene solution. Fractionation with boiling n-heptane was carried out for 18 h in Kumagawa extractors. GPC analyses were performed using a Waters 150-C A1 C/ GPC instrument equipped with ultrastyragel columns (nominal pore diameter 500,103,104,105, and 106 A) and connected to a Waters Data Station. Calibration was performed by universal calibration [ 8-10 ] . The number of vinyl and vinylidene end-groups per 1000 carbon atoms was evaluated using a Philips PU 9800 FT-IR spectrometer according to the procedure reported by Haslam et al. [11]. Results Effect of external Lewis bases on polymerization rate A first general indication of the effect which the different compounds used as external Lewis bases have on polymerization rate and catalyst activity is given by the value of the specific activity or average polymerization rate (SA ) during the first two hours of polymerization. Variable amounts of LB were used with a fixed amount of transition metals (Ti + Hf) .

For LB/ (Ti +Hf) > 2 an almost complete disappearance of catalyst activity seems to occur in the presence of TES, TMP, PES, DBP and BAc, whereas in the case of DBE about 30% of the original activity is maintained even at DBE/ (Ti +Hf)=12 (Table 1). DBP and BAc produce a marked reduction of the instantaneous polymerization rate during the first 5-40 minutes, whereas the differences between kinetic curves become much smaller at longer polymerization times (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively). DBP, which has two ester groups, gives more effective results than BAc at any concentration. In all other cases the decrease of the polymerization rate is proportional to the LB/ (Ti +Hf) ratio at any time. A typical example, referred to TES, is reported in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the addition of further Al% restores the original activity, at least in the case of BAc and DBE (Table 1, runs 17 and 24) . 22 L. Barazzoni et al./J. Mol.

Effect of external Lewis bases on polymer properties Characterization of the polyethylene obtained shows that in all cases the addition of the different LB to the cocatalyst gives rise to an increase of the melt flow index ( MI ) and to a moderate decrease of the shear sensitivity ( SS ) . These effects increase in the order: TES >_ PES > TMP > BAc >_ DBP - DBE which corresponds substantially to that observed for the polymerization activity. In particular, at TES/ (Ti+Hf)=1.25, almost the same MI and SS are obtained as with a Ti/Mg monometallic catalyst (Table 1, runs 70 and 80). L. Barazzoni et al./J Mol.

Data obtained at different polymerization times clearly show that the changes of MI and SS are more pronounced at longer polymerization times (Table 2 ). Polymer density does not vary significantly and is always in the range 0.9581 and 0.9641, which agrees with the substantial linearity of the polyethylene obtained. The type and amount of LB do not affect the end group unsaturation at any polymerization time. In the presence of external LB, significant (even if not large) variations are observed in the amount of low molecular weight polyethylene which is ex- 24 20 s 15 3 a d 10 0 z 5 L.

An appreciable increase (from 3 to 6% ) occurs with both TES and PES, which latter gives values very similar to those obtained by a Ti/MgC12 catalyst (Run 80). A plot of the amount of n-heptane-extractable polymer against MI indicates that the same proportionality constant exists for LB-free Ti/Mg and HfTi/Mg catalysts, as well as for the latter one combined with BAc DBP, PES, and TMP. Among these, the smallest MI and the lowest amount of extractable polymer are observed for the LB-free Ti+Hf/Mg system; addition of BAc, DBP, PES or TMP produces an increase of both values, thus approaching the Ti/Mg system. With DBE the amount extracted is lower than expected on the basis of the MI value, whereas the opposite holds for TES. In all cases GPC curves show a narrowing of the MWD and the disappearance of the higher MW fraction, which is clearly indicated by the lack of the high MW side that is present in the profiles of polyethylene obtained in L. Barazzoni et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993)17-27 25 the absence of LB (Table 3 and Figs. 6 and 7). The variation of MI and SS observed when using different external LB is therefore the consequence of both the formation of a higher amount of low molecular weight polymer, as shown by solvent extraction, and the disappearance of very high molecular weight polymers, as indicated by GPC. Discussion Previous experiments with monometallic Hf/Mg catalysts showed that the presence of increasing amounts of ethyl benzoate (EB) depressed the formation of high molecular weight polymers without giving a corresponding increase of _the low molecular weight fraction. Indeed, at an EB/Hf molar ratio of 1, the My was only reduced from 1.7 X 106 to 1.35 X 106 while productivity dropped to 1/5 of its original value [5]. However, in this case EB was treated with an MgCl, supported Hf-catalyst prior to the addition of TIBA (32/1 mol/ mol with respect to Hf ) . EB was therefore associated with acidic sites first and then, at least in part, removed by TIBA [ 3 ] . This situation is to some extent different from the present one, where all bases have first been treated with the aluminium alkyls before the mixture was added to the catalysts; therefore they must be considered as real external bases. The effect on Hf-catalysts by other Lewis bases of the type described in the present work does not appear to have been studied in detail. More information is available about the effect of different Lewis bases on MgCl2 supported Ti catalysts during ethylene polymerisation [ 12-14 ] . A detailed study related to oxygen containing LB investigated the effect of DBE, PES and DBP on productivity, MI and SS. At LB/Al molar ratio 1/20, DBE, PES and DBP gave a productivity decay and an MI increase. SS and hence MWD were moderately affected, without showing any clear trend [ 15 ] . On the basis of this evidence it is likely that the effect of external LB on Ti/MgC12 catalysts is mainly to reduce activity and average molecular weight. The mechanism by which this takes place is not yet completely clear. It might be related to specific interactions at the level of transition metal atoms of catalyst active sites with LB or their complexes with AIRS, even if interactions of LB with MgCl~ have very recently been demonstrated [ 16 ] . In a recent study [ 17 ] we reported that the addition of protic compounds (water, butanoic acid, butanol and methyl ethyl ketone) to aluminium alkyls before their interaction with Hf/Ti catalysts supported on MgC12 affected the polymerisation process of ethylene. Even if they appeared to be less effective than the Lewis bases which form the subject of the present paper, a reduction of the productivity was observed in all cases, with a narrowing of MWD due to a reduction of the lower molecular weight fractions. With external LB, the macroscopic effects are, similar: a decrease of productivity and narrowing of MWD. This last, however, must be predominantly related to the disappear- 26 L. Barazzoni et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993)17-27 ance of the high molecular weight fraction which should be formed on Hf-based sites, as shown by previous studies [5,7 ]. It would be tempting to explain the above results by assuming that external Lewis bases selectively poison Hf sites, whereas the reaction products of protic compounds with AIRS affect only Ti sites with a short lifetime [ 17 ] . However, this explanation is certainly oversimplified and it does not account for the strong effect of the above additives on catalytic activity. Also, it neglects the possibility of the existence of real bimetallic sites formed by the interactions between Hf and Ti species. Indeed, since Ti sites are at least ten times more active than Hf sites and, in our catalyst, the Hf/Ti ratio is 1.3, only a 10% decrease of specific activity should be observed up to LB/ (Hf+Ti) ratios equal to 0.65 (Table 1). This is not the case, at least for TES, PES and TMP; moreover, the strong reduction of activity at higher LB content clearly shows that all sites are eventually poisoned. However, the increase of MI and the reduction of SS are clearly in favour of a preferential, progressive disappearance of high molecular weight macromolecules which are responsible for the broadening of MWD when Hf-Ti bimetallic catalysts are used [ 7 ] . The GPC traces in Figs. 6 and 7 show that the shoulder on the high MW side of the bimodal distribution is not present when external LB are added to the system. It thus seems reasonable to conclude that the Hf-based sites are no longer active at that level of LB (0.80 to 1.67 molar ratio with respect to Ti + Hf ) . In conclusion, the data described here in conjunction with those previously reported demonstrate that active sites are present in Hf-Ti bimetallic catalysts which display a very distinct behaviour towards protic compounds and LB used as external additives to AIRS, respectively. In the former case the reaction products of AlR3 with protic compounds predominantly deactivate sites having considerable activity and giving relatively low molecular weight chains, whereas sites which yield very high molecular weight chains are much less affected. By contrast, Lewis bases seem to be capable of selectively poisoning this last type of site, thus hindering the formation of the highest molecular weight fractions and therefore producing a narrowing of MWD by an opposite mechanism.

The homopolymerization of ethylene was investigated in the presence of a hafnium/titanium (1:1) catalyst supported on magnesium chloride and activated with triisobutylaluminum to which different Lewis bases (LB) were added in various molar ratios. All the investigated LB, i.e. dibutyl ether, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, tetramethylpiperidine, tetraethoxysilane, and phenyltriethoxysilane, show a similar behaviour: polymer yield, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution decrease with increasing the LB:transition metal molar ratio. However, distinct features are observed when changing the nature of the LB, as well as its amount. As far as the polymer yield is concerned, dibutyl ether and tetramethylpiperidine show the lowest and the highest decreasing effect, respectively. Dibutyl ether has very little effect on molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. By contrast, silanes cause a remarkable decrease of molecular weight when molar ratios LB/(Ti + Hf) greater than 0.5 are used. Finally, tetramethylpiperidine gives strongly reduced molecular weight and molecular weight distribution when used at molar ratios appreciably lower than 0.5, while additional amounts do not have any further effect. These results are discussed in terms of possible selective interactions of different catalytic sites with the investigated LB.
