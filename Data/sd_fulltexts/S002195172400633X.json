Graphical abstract Transition metal single atom catalysts (SACs) for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation involving complex catalytic mechanism and multiple reaction pathways have received much attention, but regulating the reaction pathway of SACs is still an important challenge in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. Herein, a boron-doped Fe SAC with FeN3B configurations (Fe—BNC) was synthesized and selectively generated a non-radical pathway, in which the high-valent iron-oxo species (FeIV O) were determined as the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMS activation. The Fe-BNC/PMS system not only exhibited remarkable reaction kinetic constant (0.949 min−1) and turnover frequency (9.49 L min−1g−1) for the phenol degradation, but also showed excellent selectivity to phenols with strong electron-donating ability. Mechanism exploration based on theoretical calculations revealed that high activity of Fe-BNC originated from the reinforced adsorption energy and enhanced overlap between Fe 3d and O 2p orbits, which facilitated to strengthen the Fe-O bonding and accelerate the electron transfer, thus modulating the PMS activation via a non-radical pathway. Successful extendibility of Fe-BNC in treatment of the real water and coking wastewater demonstrates its application potential. This work elucidates the mechanism of selectively generating a non-radical pathway over B-doped Fe-based SAC, and provides a rational strategy for preparing SACs alone with a non-radical pathway.

The peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-mediated advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been extensively investigated for their potential in effectively degrading refractory organics [3–5]. In addition, activating PMS in the Fenton-like reaction by heterogeneous catalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) without additional energy has received increasing attention, which commonly involves two main pathways: radical pathway and non-radical pathway. In the radical pathway, PMS can be decomposed to produce highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals (·OH), sulfate radicals (SO4·-), and superoxide radicals ( O2 –). In the non-radical pathway, singlet oxygen (1O2), high-valent metal–oxygen species, and direct electron transfer are produced for the pollutants degradation [6,7]. Compared to these radical species, non-radical species show higher selectivity for target contaminants and well resistance to environmental disturbances [8,9]. Therefore, the development of catalytic materials for activating PMS by non-radical pathway holds great significance in real water and wastewater treatment. The selectivity of ROS generation relies on the electronic structure of metal active sites, which determines the selective adsorption of O atoms in PMS and the direction of electron transfer [10]. Single atom catalysts (SACs) are ideal candidates for the design of selective materials in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction due to their excellent atomic utilization efficiencies and tunable electron environment. Currently, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (MN-C) SACs with a low cost exhibit a greater selectivity and activity in activating PMS for wastewater degradation via non-radical pathway [7]. Compared to other M-N-C materials, Fe-NC not only possesses a stronger PMS activation ability but also can achieve a non-radical pathway by adsorbing the terminal oxygen of PMS during activation process. For example, Zhang et al. developed a graphitic carbon nitride supported SACs with a typical Fe-N4 moiety, which could adsorb the terminal oxygen of PMS and achieve 100 % 1O2 generation by activating PMS [11]. Cheng et al. prepared a Fe-N-C SAC featuring Fe-N4 active sites, which could adsorb the terminal oxygen of PMS and enhance the charge transfer from Fe site to PMS for generation of high-valent iron-oxo species (FeIV-O) [12]. However, the symmetric electron distribution in this typical Fe-N4 structure resulted in unsatisfied electron transfer efficiencies. Thus breaking the balance state is expected to overcome this problem and further promote PMS activation for the generation of non-radicals [13]. Recent reports manifested that the electronic structure of M-N4-C in SACs could be efficiently modulated by doping heteroatoms with different electronegativity, such as B, O, P, and S [14–18]. Among these heteroatoms, B possessed a similar atomic radius with C, which facilitated its incorporation into carbon support [19]. Moreover, B also possessed a lower electronegativity, which could have great effect on the electron distribution around metal active centers. Previous studies demonstrated that the B-doping decreased the electronic density around Cu active sites and optimized PMS adsorption energy, therefore resulting in the superior bisphenol A (BPA) degradation efficiency by CuIII OH species [16]. Besides, Co-BNC SAC with CoN3B coordination also showed excellent sulfamethoxazole removal capacity via non-radical pathway with generating CoIV O species, which was attributed to the stronger electronic density around Co active sites alone with B doping [20]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that regulating the charge density of Fe-N4 through B doping to enhance the non-radical pathway is a feasible method. However, the catalytic mechanism and application potential of B-doped M-N-C SACs activating PMS for pollutant degradation via non-radical pathway is still ambiguous. Meanwhile, the research on the relationship between the electron structure of the B-doped Fe-N-C SACs and the properties of phenolic contaminants in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction at atomic-level insight is still limited. Herein, B, N co-doped carbon supported Fe SAC with Fe-N3B configurations (Fe-BNC) was synthesized successfully. The high-activity origin and mechanism underlying intrinsic activity enhancement of B-doped Fe-NC SAC by PMS activation with non-radical pathway for removing phenolic organics were investigated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal the impact of B-doping on the electronic density and the interface interaction between metal active sites and PMS. Moreover, the relationship between degradation efficiency and the properties of phenolic pollutants was revealed in the Fe-BNC/PMS system. Finally, a real wastewater was applied to demonstrate the applicability of the B-doped Fe SAC by PMS activation. This work has achieved a high selectively generated non-radical pathway via B doping in Fe-based SAC and explored the structural feature of Fe— BNC in depth, which provides an important reference for the heteroatom-doped in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, >99 %), ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, 98 %), 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM, 98 %), boric acid (H3BO3, ≥99.5 %), 2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4 (PMS, 42 ∼ 46 %), phenol(≥99 %), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP, ≥99 %), bisphenol A (BPA, 99 %), 2,4-dichlorophene (DCP, 99 %), o-nitrophenol (2-NP, 99 %), acetaminophen (AcP, 99 %), 4-methoxyphenol (MQ, 99 %), p-nitrophenol (4-NP, 99 %), tert-butanol (TBA, 99.5 %), sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, 99 %), furfuryl alcohol (FFA, 98 %), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine-N-oxide (DMPO, 97 %), and methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO, 98 %) were bought from Macklin Co. Ltd. Chloroform (CF, 98 %) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP, 98 %) were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. Ethanol (75 %) and methanol (MeOH, >99.5 %) were obtained from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used without any further purification. Surface water was taken from Shahe reservoir (Beijing, China), and the secondary effluent was gained after biological treatment in the wastewater treatment plant (Beijing, China). Raw wastewater was collected from a coking chemical plant (Shandong Province, China). The detailed water quality parameters were listed in Table S1 and S2. 2.2 Preparation of the catalysts Fe-BNC was prepared using a previously reported method with some modifications [21]. Firstly, 33.5 mmol 2-MIM was dissolved in 7.5 mL deionized water, marked as Solution A. Then, 2.8 mmol Zn (CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.7 mmol H3BO3, and 0.7 mmol FeCl2·4H2O were dissolved in 7.5 mL deionized water, denoted as Solution B. Then, Solution A was quickly dripped into Solution B, and kept stirring strongly for 6 h at room temperature. The resultant dark yellow solid was washed with deionized water, and then dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 6 h. The obtained precursor was calcined at 900 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere, which was designated as nano-Fe-BNC. Subsequently, the nano-FeBNC was impregnated with 2 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 2 h to remove the Fe nanoparticles in the catalyst, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C overnight under vacuum to obtain Fe-BNC. Meanwhile, the preparation of Fe-BNC-X catalysts were carried out under specified pyrolysis temperatures (X = 700, 800, and 1000 °C), and other preparation conditions kept the same as those for Fe-BNC. BNC was synthesized by a similar procedure without addition of FeCl2·4H2O, while NC was obtained by the same procedure without FeCl2·4H2O and H3BO3. In addition, the preparation of Fe-NC SAC was also based on a previously reported method [21]. 2.3 Heterogeneous PMS-mediated Fenton-like experiments Phenol was used as the target pollutant to evaluate the performance of the prepared catalysts in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. The performance tests were conducted in a glass beaker at room temperature. Firstly, a certain amount of catalyst was loaded into the phenol solution (20 mg L-1, 50 mL) under stirring for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, a fresh PMS solution (10 g L-1, 1.0 mL) was added to initiate degradation reaction. At predetermined time intervals, the solution was taken out and immediately quenched with Na2S2O3 solution to prevent the continuous degradation of organics in the reaction. Finally, the resulting solution was filtered through 0.22 μm filters for analysis. In addition, other phenolic compounds, including 4-CP, BPA, DCP, 2-NP, AcP, MQ, and 4-NP, were further used as objects to assess the performance of FeBNC. The concentration of phenolic compounds was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, 1260 Infinity, Agilent, USA) with a C-18 column, and the detailed operating conditions were listed in Table S3. Total organic carbon (TOC) was used to evaluate the mineralization of the pollutants on a TOC-LCPH (Shimadzu, Japan). Phenol degradation intermediates were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS, Dionex Ultimate 3000 and Q Exactive Focus, Thermo, Germany), described in Supporting information. In the quenching experiments, MeOH, TBA, CF, FFA, and PMSO were used to scavenge the corresponding ROS generated during the reaction. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests for ROS identification were performed by employing DMPO and TEMP as the spin trapping agents. The detailed procedures of electrochemical experiments and EPR tests were described in Supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and morphological characterizations of the catalysts The morphology of Fe-BNC and nano-Fe-BNC catalysts were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As exhibited in SEM images (Fig. S1a and b), the Fe-BNC displayed a clear dodecahedral morphology, while many Fe nanoparticles were observed in nano-Fe-BNC. In the TEM images of the catalysts (Fig. S1c and d), Fe-BNC displayed a layered carbon structure with minimal encapsulated Fe nanoparticles or clusters, while a significant quantity of Fe nanoparticles was observed on the carbon layer of nano-Fe-BNC. The Fe-NC catalysts, both with and without B doping, exhibited good surface areas and high pore volume structures (Table S4), indicating that the large surface area of carbon support afforded abundant anchoring sites for Fe and B atoms. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared catalysts were showed in Fig. S2. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of BNC at ca. 2θ = 25° and 44° were corresponded to the (002) and (101) phases of carbon material. While the XRD pattern of Fe-BNC was similar to that of BNC, no prominent reflections from Fe nanoparticles or clusters were observed, indicating that Fe species were primarily dispersed as Fe single atoms. However, the diffraction peaks of metal nanoparticles were observed in the XRD pattern of nano-Fe-BNC, indicating that a 2-hour acid impregnation treatment removed a great majority of metal nanoparticles or clusters in the Fe-based catalysts. In addition, the Fe loading content of Fe-BNC and Fe-NC was 3.69 and 4.87 wt% respectively, determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. A higher Fe loading content was observed in nano-Fe-BNC (4.96 wt%) and nano-Fe-NC (8.19 wt%), further validating that the most of Fe nanoparticles or clusters were effectively removed by acid etching. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was applied to further verify the Fe distribution state of Fe-BNC (Fig. 1 a and b). The bright spots marked by red circles were recognized as the atomically dispersed Fe, confirming that Fe species were uniformly dispersed on the carbon material in the form of single atoms. In addition, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images showed a uniform distribution of C, N, B, and Fe elements throughout the Fe-BNC (Fig. 1c). These results proved that B-doped Fe SAC was synthesized successfully. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were used to further confirm the coordination environment of Fe single atoms in Fe-BNC. The X-ray adsorption near edge structure (XANES) of Fe K-edge spectra displayed that the Fe rising edge of Fe-BNC was located between Fe foil and Fe2O3, indicating that the chemical state of Fe species in Fe-BNC was between 0 and + 3 (Fig. 1d). According to the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 1e), Fe2O3 showed three major peaks, the peaks at 2.5 and 3.2 Å were assigned to Fe-Fe bond, and the peak at 1.4 Å was attributed to the Fe-O bond. In addition, Fe foil showed a major peak at 2.2 Å, which was assigned to the Fe-Fe bond. Fe-BNC only showed one main peak at 1.5 Å, which was assigned to the Fe-N or Fe-B coordination and no Fe-Fe bond was observed [21], verifying the atomically dispersed Fe in Fe-BNC was achieved on the carbon material. This result was further confirmed by the Wavelet Transform (WT)-EXAFS results (Fig. 1g), where the Fe-BNC spectra lacked Fe-Fe wavelet peaks resembling those in the Fe foil and Fe2O3 spectra. Instead, only a singular wavelet signal with one intensity maximum at approximately 4 Å−1 was observed, which was close to that of Fe-Pc (∼4 Å−1) reported in other literature [22], confirming that Fe element mainly existed as the single atoms in Fe-BNC. Furthermore, the fitting analysis of Fourier transformed (FT)-EXAFS was performed to confirm the coordination structure of Fe atoms in Fe-BNC. The fitted models and the detailed parameters revealed the coordination numbers of Fe-N and Fe-B were 3.3 and 1.2, respectively (Fig. 1f, Table S5). These results manifested the existence of a potential Fe-N3B configuration, indicating that B was successfully doped into the Fe-N4 moieties and replaced one N atom in the first shell. Compared to Fe-N4 with the symmetric geometric structure, the B-doped Fe SAC tended to exhibit distinct catalytic performance for PMS activation to degrade pollutants. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further obtain the chemical bonding information of elements in BNC and Fe-BNC (Table S6). As illustrated in Fig. S3a and b, the N 1 s and O 1 s spectra showed the N-B and O-B bonds in BNC. The Fe 2p spectra of Fe-BNC demonstrated four main peaks and two satellite peaks (Fig. S4a). The peaks at 710.6 eV and 724.7 eV could be assigned to Fe (II), while the peaks at 712.9 eV and 726.9 eV could be ascribed to Fe (III), confirming the existence of Fe (II) and Fe (III) in Fe-BNC [23], in agreement with the result of Fe K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of Fe-BNC. The N 1 s spectra of Fe-BNC displayed five peaks, including pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, Fe-N, graphitic N, and N-B bonds (Fig. S4b). Compared to the N 1 s spectra of BNC (Fig. S3a), the content of pyridinic N in Fe-BNC decreased drastically, while the content of Fe-N increased, thereby pyridinic N was considered to be converted into Fe-N for anchoring Fe species. Besides, the C 1 s spectra of Fe-BNC showed four main peaks assigned to O-C, N-C, C-C, and B-C bonds (Fig. S4c). O 1 s spectra exhibited two peaks, attributed to O-B and C-O-C/C-OH bonds (Fig. S4d). The presence of N-B, C-B, and O-B bonds in the spectra of Fe-BNC, along with Fe-B bond observed in the EXAFS fitting results and B dispersion in the EDS results, manifested the successful introduction of B into Fe-BNC. 3.2 Catalytic performances The activity of the catalysts was evaluated based on their phenol degradation efficiency in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. The results of adsorption experiment demonstrated that phenol adsorption on the prepared Fe-based catalysts was less than 11 % (Fig. S5). As shown in Fig. 2 a, the performance of PMS alone was negligible, and the NC/PMS and BNC/PMS systems also exhibited a limited phenol removal. Additionally, it was found that phenol was degraded slightly when using Fe (II) salt equivalent to the Fe content in Fe-BNC. In contrast, the Fe-NC/PMS system displayed an enhanced removal efficiency, achieving 92 % phenol abatement within 30 min. Notably, Fe-BNC exhibited superior phenol removal capacity compared to Fe-NC, which could remove phenol completely within 20 min. This indicated that Fe single atoms served as the primary active sites for PMS activation and B doping further improved the phenol removal efficiency. In order to gain a deeper insight into the role of Fe single atoms in phenol degradation in the Fe-BNC/PMS system, Fe-BNC with a 24-hour acid treatment was prepared, and TEM image (Fig. S6) showed that Fe nanoparticles or clusters were not observed in Fe-BNC with 24-hour acid treatment, indicating that Fe nanoparticles or clusters had been completely removed from Fe-BNC. Subsequently, the performance of Fe-BNC with 24-hour acid treatment was evaluated for phenol degradation through PMS activation (Fig. S6). A tiny change in the performance of phenol removal over Fe-BNC with and without Fe nanoparticles or clusters suggested that the contribution of Fe nanoparticles or clusters to phenol removal could be considered negligible and Fe single atoms dominated phenol degradation in Fe-BNC/PMS system. Furthermore, Fe-BNC-X catalysts were prepared under different pyrolysis temperatures (X = 700, 800, and 1000 °C) to assess their catalytic activity in the degradation of phenol via PMS activation (Fig. S7). The results demonstrated a progressive enhancement in catalytic performance of Fe-BNC-X as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 to 900°C. However, the performance declined when the temperature reached to 1000°C. A pyrolysis temperature of 900°C was applied as the optimal condition for synthesizing Fe-BNC SAC for phenol removal in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant (k obs, 0.949 min−1) in Fe-BNC was ca. 1.96 times higher than that of Fe-NC (0.485 min−1) in activating PMS for phenol degradation (Fig. 2b). Further normalizing k obs to surface area (k SA) and Fe content (k MC) of Fe-BNC still yielded ca. 1.51 and 2.62 times higher than those of Fe-NC (Table S7), suggesting that the enhanced catalytic performance of Fe-BNC was primarily attributed to the manipulation of electronic properties driven by B-doping, rather than differences of surface area and metal loading of the Fe-based SACs. Moreover, the k obs and k MC of Fe-BNC were ca. 1.63 and 2.19 times higher than those of nano-Fe-BNC (Fig. S8), indicating that Fe single atoms significantly enhanced phenol degradation efficiency due to a higher dispersion of active Fe sites for PMS activation in the Fenton-like reaction. Besides, k obs, turnover frequency (TOF), and KMCP were used to further evaluate the catalytic efficiency of Fe-BNC for phenol degradation in the heterogeneous PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. The k obs (0.949 min−1) and TOF (9.49 L min-1g−1) of Fe-BNC were obviously higher than those of nanocatalysts and state-of-the-art SACs that recently reported [24–33], in which the k obs was 2.3 ∼ 47.5 times higher than those of previous reports (Fig. S9, Table S8). Moreover, Fe-BNC exhibited a relatively high KMCP​ value (12.86 L2 min−1 g−2) compared to the reported Fe-based SACs for phenol degradation by PMS activation. The above results manifested that Fe-BNC exhibited excellent performance toward PMS activation for phenol removal. The phenol degradation intermediates in the Fe-BNC/PMS system were identified by analysis of UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS. Based on the intermediates identification data and previous literature, two degradation pathways of phenol were proposed (Fig. S10) [34–36]. In pathway I, the formation of TP1 (m/z, 110) was attributed to the attack of the C–H bond at the para position of the hydroxyl group of phenol by ROS. Following this, TP1 (m/z, 110) was further degraded to TP2 (m/z, 128) via ring-opening and oxidation reactions, which was subsequently oxidized to form TP3 (m/z, 146) and TP4 (m/z, 160). In pathway II, TP5 (m/z, 186) was formed through a coupling reaction of two phenol molecules. Eventually, a portion of produced intermediates was mineralized into CO2 and H2O, and high mineralization (over 65 %) was achieved in the Fe-BNC/PMS system for phenol degradation. To evaluate the application potential of the Fe-BNC/PMS system, the catalytic performance for phenol abatement was further explored under different pH and reaction temperature. Fe-BNC showed excellent phenol decomposition capacity in a wide pH range from 3.0 to 9.0 (Fig. 2c), and the optimal performance was achieved at near pH 7.0. Besides, the Fe-BNC/PMS system also showed high phenol degradation efficiency in a wide reaction temperature (Fig. 2d). The k obs was directly proportional to the reaction temperature, and the calculated activation energy for phenol removal in the Fe-BNC/PMS system was 1.87 kJ mol−1. In addition, the stability of Fe-BNC was evaluated by conducting recycling experiments for phenol degradation (Fig. S11). In Fe-BNC/PMS system, 100 % phenol abatement was observed in the first cycle, followed by 75 % removal in the second cycle, and 66 % conversion in the third cycle. After regenerating the Fe-BNC through calcination at 900°C, the phenol degradation efficiency improved dramatically to nearly 88 %. No obviously metal ion leaching was detected during the reaction. The findings suggested that intermediates adsorbed onto the catalyst hindered the removal of phenol in the Fe-BNC/PMS system. To gain further insight into the relationship between the catalytic performance of Fe-BNC and the properties of phenolic pollutants in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction, eight types of phenolic pollutants, including phenol, DCP, 2-NP, etc., were employed to assess the performance of Fe-BNC within 30 min. As illustrated in Fig. S12, the removal efficiency of the pollutants exceeded 80 %, except for 4-NP, indicating the excellent removal capability of the Fe-BNC/PMS system for phenolic pollutants. Particularly, the system demonstrated outstanding performance for ACP and MQ, with their respective k obs values reaching 1.087 and 1.500 min−1 (Fig. 3 a). Previous studies suggested that molecular descriptors, such as dissociation constant (pK a), Hammett substituent constant (σ+), and the n-Octanol/water partition constant (k ow) could describe the chemical structure and physicochemical properties of organic compounds [37]. Specifically, σ+ serves as a quantitative measure of the electron-donating capability of substituents for organic compounds. A lower σ+ value indicates a stronger electron-donating ability. The pK a reflects a molecule’s ability to lose or gain protons in aqueous solution, and the k ow describes the migration and transformation of substances in environmental media. As shown in Fig. 3b, the logk obs value was found to be inversely proportional to σ+ value (R2 = 0.87), suggesting that Fe-BNC was more effective in degrading phenolic compounds with a stronger electron-donating capacity through PMS activation. This implied that the Fe-BNC/PMS system might be dominated by the non-radical pathway. A positive linear relationship between logk obs and pK a was also observed (R2 = 0.75, Fig. 3c), demonstrating that ROS produced by PMS decomposition in Fe-BNC was more inclined to remove phenolic contaminants with a lower proton loss capacity. However, the Fe-BNC/PMS system showed a weak correlation between logk ow and the corresponding logk obs (Fig. 3d), implying that the performance of Fe-BNC was not influenced by the hydrophobicity of phenolic pollutants. Thus, the selectivity of Fe-BNC was closely related to their electron-donating ability of phenolic pollutants in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. 3.3 Identification of the main active species To explore the generation of ROS in phenol oxidation and the associated catalytic mechanism, EPR tests and quenching experiments were performed in the Fe-NC/PMS and Fe-BNC/PMS systems. The EPR measurement results with DMPO and TEMP as the spin-trapping agents (Fig. 4 a) suggested that no obvious signals in the presence of PMS alone, while the intensities of DMPO-OH, DMPO-O2·−, and TEMP-1O2 signals were relatively enhanced in the Fe-NC/PMS and Fe-BNC/PMS systems, confirming that ·OH, O2·−, and 1O2 were generated. The radical scavengers, including TBA, MeOH, FFA, CF, and PMSO, were used to identify the presence of various ROS, involving ·OH, SO4·-, 1O2, O2·−, and FeIV O [38,39]. The addition of MeOH, TBA, and CF exerted very weak inhibitory effects on the phenol elimination in these two systems (Fig. 4b). Besides, the addition of FFA resulted in a relatively strong inhibitory effect, indicating that 1O2 had a certain contribution to phenol degradation in both systems. However, they were not the main ROS in both systems due to the limited inhibitory effects observed on the phenol degradation. PMSO was used as a probe to identify the presence of FeIV O in the systems. It was worth noting that the addition of PMSO exerted an almost complete inhibitory effect on the phenol removal, indicating that FeIV O was the main ROS in both systems. In addition, SCN- was employed as a chelating agent to inhibit the activation of PMS by Fe sites [40,41]. Phenol degradation was also almost completely suppressed in the presence of SCN-, suggesting that single Fe atoms were the active sites for activating PMS in Fe-NC and Fe-BNC. The above results confirmed that the Fe-based SACs generated FeIV O as the main ROS by activating PMS for the pollutant degradation, along with a non-radical pathway. In order to further explore the B-doping effect on the electron transfer process of the Fe-based SACs during phenol degradation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Fe-NC and Fe-BNC were recorded. EIS revealed that Fe-BNC displayed a smaller semicircle, suggesting that Fe-BNC had a smaller electron transfer resistance (Fig. 4c). Additionally, a slight increase in current was observed in the LSV plot when phenol was added to the electrolyte (Fig. S13). However, a significant current enhancement was noted when PMS was added alone or in combination with phenol to the electrolyte. This result indicated that phenol decomposition was accelerated by the interaction between Fe-BNC and PMS [42]. The chronoamperometry (i-t curve) was used to further identify the effect of B doping in Fe-NC on PMS activation. According to previously reported literature, the injection of PMS alone with distinct current jumps demonstrated electron transfer from the catalysts to PMS [16,43]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the current jump appeared as injecting PMS, indicating that electrons flowed from the Fe-based SACs to PMS, which led to PMS decomposition and ROS generation. Moreover, the jump intensity on the electrode coated with Fe-BNC was stronger than that on the electrode coated with Fe-NC, demonstrating that PMS accepted more electrons and more quickly decomposed to generate FeIV O in Fe-BNC. Subsequently, the injection of phenol resulted in the opposite direction of current change, implying electron transfer from phenol to the catalysts, in accordance with the literature [16]. These results confirmed that B doping in Fe-NC effectively accelerated the electron transfer, improved PMS activation to generate FeIV O species for phenol degradation. 3.4 Catalytic mechanism based on DFT calculations DFT calculations were utilized to reveal the origin and mechanism of the superior performance of Fe-BNC in depth. The optimized geometries of the model catalysts were presented in Fig. S14. The region with a higher electronic density distribution was occupied around Fe atom in the Fe-based SACs (Fig. 5 a and b). In Fe-NC, the electrons surrounding Fe and N exhibited a symmetric distribution. However, the introduction of B disrupted the symmetric electron distribution, resulting in a relatively poorer electronic density around B and a richer electronic density around Fe atom (7.20 e) in Fe-BNC, compared to that around Fe atom (6.86 e) in Fe-NC. Due to a lower electronegativity of B (2.04) compared to that of N (3.04), N tended to extract more electrons from Fe. When one N atom in Fe-N4 was replaced by B atom with a lower electronegativity, more electrons could be accumulated around Fe atom, in consistent with the reported literature [44]. We constructed adsorption configurations of PMS on the surfaces of Fe-BNC and Fe-NC, and calculated the adsorption energy (Eads) for each configuration (Fig. 5c and d, S15). In the Fe-N4 and the Fe-N3B configurations, the Eads for terminal oxygen of PMS adsorbed on Fe atoms was significantly more negative than that for the middle oxygen of PMS, indicating that Fe atoms preferentially adsorbed the terminal oxygen of PMS, subsequently breaking the chemical bonds within the PMS molecule to generate ROS. In addition, the Eads in the Fe-N3B (−3.54 eV) was more negative than that in the Fe-N4 (−2.78 eV), suggesting that the introduction of B resulted in a more favorable and stable adsorption of PMS on Fe active sites in Fe-N3B. Furthermore, the O-S bond length (1.518 Å) in adsorption configuration of PMS on Fe-N3B was more strongly stretched than that in Fe-NC (1.499 Å), indicating that the O-S bond in PMS was more easily broken when PMS was adsorbed on Fe atom in Fe-BNC. Therefore, B-doped Fe-NC effectively enhanced PMS activation to generate ROS for the pollutant degradation. The Bader charge analysis revealed a more robust electron transfer from Fe-BNC (0.817 e) to PMS compared with Fe-NC (0.809 e), suggesting a more efficient facilitation of electron transfer from Fe-BNC to PMS (Fig. 5e and f), which was in agreement with the i-t curve result of Fe-BNC. The projected density of states (PDOS) for Fe-based SACs was illustrated (Fig. 5g), demonstrating that the overlap between the Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals in Fe-BNC/PMS was more pronounced than that in Fe-NC/PMS. These results indicated an enhanced interaction and a smoother electron transfer process between Fe-BNC and PMS, in good agreement with the Bader charge analysis. Based on the above results, we proposed a possible catalytic mechanism for phenol degradation in the Fe-BNC/PMS system. The introduction of B modulated the electron distribution around Fe atoms, forming electron-rich Fe active sites in Fe-BNC, enhancing the PMS adsorption on Fe active sites through terminal oxygen, and then leading to the stretching of O-S bond in the PMS molecule. Along with the electron transfer from Fe-BNC to PMS, the stretched O-S bond was broken, and the adsorbed PMS decomposed to generate FeIV-O, thereby allowing the Fe-BNC/PMS system to achieve excellent degradation efficiency for phenolic pollutants. 3.5 Application of Fe-BNC in real water and wastewater The widespread occurrence of inorganic ions and organic components in water and wastewater on phenol abatement were assessed in the Fe-BNC/PMS system. Remarkably, the impacts of various coexisting anions (SO4 2−, HCO3 −, NO3 −, Cl− and F−) were very slight (Fig. 6 a), further proving that the elimination of phenol could be attributed to the non-radical pathway in the Fe-BNC/PMS system, in agreement with the generation of FeIV O as the main ROS. Moreover, we also investigated the impact of heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) widely detected in industrial wastewater on the phenol degradation in the Fe-BNC/PMS system (Fig. S16). Phenol was completely removed within 30 min, indicating that heavy metal ions had minimal effect on the performance of Fe-BNC. These results demonstrated that the Fe-BNC/PMS system exhibited excellent application potential in real water and wastewater. We have explored the application of Fe-BNC/PMS system in the surface water and the secondary effluent coming from the wastewater treatment plant. Fe-BNC achieved high phenol removal efficiency (over 90 %) in surface water, with a slight decrease in the secondary effluent coming from the wastewater treatment plant (Fig. 6b). This result proved that the Fe-BNC/PMS system had the potential to degrade phenol in actual water. In order to further verify the application potential of Fe-BNC in real wastewater treatment, the wastewater collected from a coking chemical plant was used in our experiments. Based on the analysis of the water quality, organic compounds (phenol and other phenolic compounds), cations, and anions were detected in the coking wastewater. The Fe-BNC/PMS system showed excellent phenol degradation efficiency for the real coking wastewater, with phenol being completely removed within 20 min (Fig. 6c). Meanwhile, TOC abatement reached to 69.3 % within 30 min. As a control, PMS alone had no significant removal of phenol and TOC. Moreover, the fluorescence detection of the coking wastewater before and after Fe-BNC/PMS treatment was measured. The EEM plot of raw coking wastewater (Fig. 6d) exhibited that the main peak position was concentrated in Ex/Em = 275 ∼ 400 / 250 ∼ 350 nm, indicating that there were a large amount of soluble microbial metabolites in the raw coking wastewater [45]. After 30 min treatment, the peak intensity was significantly weakened (Fig. 6e), demonstrating that the Fe-BNC/PMS system exhibited a good ability to destroy the pollutants in the coking wastewater, alone with anti-inference of ions. The above results manifested that Fe-BNC exhibited the exceptional ability to remove organics and was a successful candidate for an application potential in the water and wastewater treatment. 4 Conclusions In this work, we successfully synthesized a B-doped Fe SAC with FeN3B configurations, exhibiting excellent catalytic performance in PMS activation for phenol elimination, as evidenced by the higher k obs (0.949 min−1), TOF (9.49 L min-1g−1), and KMCP (12.86 L2 min−1 g−2) of Fe-BNC compared to that of previously reported catalysts. Besides, the Fe-BNC/PMS system demonstrated high selectivity for phenolic compounds with strong electron-donating ability. The result of Fe-BNC/PMS system in treatment of real water and industrial wastewater unequivocally proved its great potential for future applications. DFT calculations manifested that B-doping increased the electron density around Fe sites, enhanced the overlap of Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals, and strengthened the interaction between PMS and Fe active sites, thereby facilitating electron transfer from catalyst to PMS for generating FeIV O. Overall, this work achieved high selectivity in generating a non-radical pathway via B doping in Fe-based SAC and elucidated the reaction mechanism of phenol degradation, which provides an important reference for the heteroatom-doped that selectively generate non-radicals in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal single atom catalysts (SACs) for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation involving complex catalytic mechanism and multiple reaction pathways have received much attention, but regulating the reaction pathway of SACs is still an important challenge in the PMS-mediated Fenton-like reaction. Herein, a boron-doped Fe SAC with FeN3B configurations (Fe—BNC) was synthesized and selectively generated a non-radical pathway, in which the high-valent iron-oxo species (FeIV O) were determined as the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMS activation. The Fe-BNC/PMS system not only exhibited remarkable reaction kinetic constant (0.949 min−1) and turnover frequency (9.49 L min−1g−1) for the phenol degradation, but also showed excellent selectivity to phenols with strong electron-donating ability. Mechanism exploration based on theoretical calculations revealed that high activity of Fe-BNC originated from the reinforced adsorption energy and enhanced overlap between Fe 3d and O 2p orbits, which facilitated to strengthen the Fe-O bonding and accelerate the electron transfer, thus modulating the PMS activation via a non-radical pathway. Successful extendibility of Fe-BNC in treatment of the real water and coking wastewater demonstrates its application potential. This work elucidates the mechanism of selectively generating a non-radical pathway over B-doped Fe-based SAC, and provides a rational strategy for preparing SACs alone with a non-radical pathway.",
