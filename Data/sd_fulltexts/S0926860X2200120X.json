As the two main components in typical three-way catalysts, Pd-Al2O3 and Pd-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 usually show different Pd-support interaction strength. Thus, Pd could re-distribute between Al2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 upon heating. Here the strategy to mix Pd/La-Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (before or after calcination, or after aging) was researched. The optimal choice was “mixing-calcination-aging”, offering the highest oxygen storage capacity, Pd dispersion and catalytic activity for CO and C3H6 elimination during the three-way catalytic reaction. Thus, the “mixing-calcination-aging” strategy holds promise in industrial applications, as demonstrated at the monolith converter level. The transient drop in conversion with increasing temperature (“kink”) appeared simultaneously for CO, NO and C3H6 over the “mixing-calcination-aging” monolith, but did not over the calcined counterpart “mixing-calcination”. The kinks disappeared for the used “mixing-calcination-aging”, but could be restored upon re-oxidizing. By virtue of the in situ Raman characterization, the reduction of PdO under the reaction conditions was found to cause the kinks. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords CO oxidation Propene oxidation PdO reduction in situ Raman TWC 1 Introduction Since its birth in 1981 [1], the three-way catalysts (TWCs) have contributed much to environmental protection and human health. The platinum-group metals (PGMs) are indispensable for the TWCs: to the best of our knowledge, no PGM-free TWC has been widely adopted in the industrial application. The scarcity and high cost of the PGMs, such as Pt, Pd and Rh [2–4], especially the mostly used Pd, have pushed the continuous researches on pursuing new ways to save the PGMs, when facing the more and more strict regulation of the exhaust emissions. To this end, multiple methods have been developed, including advanced coating (e.g., layered coating [3], zoned coating [5]), special thermal treatments (e.g., reductive annealing [6], high temperature impregnation [7], hydrothermal after-treatment [8]). Also, high dispersion deposition methods such as impregnation[9], doping into support lattice [10,11], precursor optimization [12], and porous inert oxide layer protection [13] have been proposed for the introduction of PGMs into TWCs. Among them, the impregnation is one of the most popular methods that have been widely adopted in industry, due to its easy implementation and high efficiency. Continuous efforts have been made to optimize the procedures for the impregnation method, in order to improve the efficiency of the TWCs. The TWCs generally contain thermally stable La-doped Al2O3 with high specific surface area [14,15] to disperse the active PGMs [16,17] especially at high temperatures, and PGM-loaded [18,19] ceria-based oxides to offer high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [20], as well as other additives. Thereinto, the Al2O3 support could also hinder the sintering of the ceria-based oxides [21,22]. As reported by Fujiwara et al. [23], the Pd/Al2O3 only shows one type of active Pd site for the three-way catalytic reaction, namely that residing on the surface of a hemisphere (Pds). While, the Pd/CeO2–ZrO2 exhibits another more active site besides Pds, that is, the Pd on the circular periphery of the Pd/CeO2–ZrO2 interface. Furthermore, the CeO2 could more effectively disperse Pd than γ-Al2O3, even with a much lower specific surface area [24,25]. The migration of Pd species between Al2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 during thermal treatments would influence the dispersion and chemical environment of Pd and the resultant catalytic activity. The different Pd-oxide interaction strength of Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 is the driving force for the Pd migration, while a high-temperature operation is still required to overcome the kinetic barrier. It has been reported that the PdO x species on Al2O3 could easily migrate onto the Ce-Zr-O-rich grains surface at 1000 ℃ due to the strong interaction between Pd and ceria-based oxides [26]. So, the strategy to mix Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (before or after calcination at 550 ℃, or after aging at 1000 ℃) could influence the final Pd distribution. It is highly desirable to further improve the three-way catalytic activity by facilely adjusting the mixing strategy. In present work, the influence of the strategy for mixing the Pd/La-Al2O3 and the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 on the activity of three-way catalysts was systematically investigated. The La-Al2O3 and the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 with equal mass and the same Pd loading were mixed before or after calcination, or after aging. Among them, the strategy of “mixing-calcination-aging” was demonstrated to be the best for the aged samples, offering the highest OSC, the dispersion of Pd and the activity for CO and C3H6 elimination. A monolith converter was further made based on the “mixing-calcination-aging” strategy, showing desirably low ignition temperatures during the three-way catalytic reactions. Furthermore, thanks to the real time response of the infrared gas sensor, kinks in the pollutant conversion curves during the reaction were observed for the “mixing-calcination-aging” monolith converter, showing transient activity deterioration with increasing temperature. In situ Raman spectroscopy has provided strong evidence for this phenomenon, unveiling the role of crystalline PdO reduction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation Palladium nitrate solution with a Pd content of 24 wt% and pH of 1.5 (from SINO-PLATINUM METALS CO., LTD.) was used as the Pd precursor. The calcined (at 550 ℃) 10 wt% La2O3-doped γ-Al2O3 support (125 m2/g) was purchased from Sasol, and the calcined (at 550 ℃) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (60 m2/g) was from Solvay. The transmission electron microscope images and N2 isothermal adsorption/desorption curves of these supports were shown in Fig. S1, and S2, respectively. 2.1.1 Sequence of mixing, calcination and aging The preparation procedure was illustrated in Fig. 1. The Pd/La-Al2O3 and the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 were both obtained by impregnation with the same Pd loading of 1.5 wt%, and dried before use. In a typical procedure for the preparation of Pd/La-Al2O3, the La-Al2O3 (7.388 g) was dispersed in deionized water (DI H2O, 5.6 g) and stirred for 1 h. Then, the precursor of Pd (containing 0.112 g of Pd) was added dropwise into the slurry under stirring. After another 2 h of stirring, the mixture was dried at 150 ℃ to get the Pd/La-Al2O3. Similarly, the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was obtained using the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (7.388 g) to replace La-Al2O3, and 11.8 g of DI H2O was used instead, due to the different water-absorbing ability of the supports. For the preparation of the “m-c-a” sample (m-mixing, c-calcination, a-aging, hereinafter inclusive), the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and the Pd/La-Al2O3 with equal mass were mixed thoroughly in a mortar, then calcined at 550 ℃ in static air for 3 h (getting “m-c”), followed by aging at 1000 ℃ in static air for 4 h (getting the “m-c-a” sample). Samples were naturally cooled down to below 60 ℃ in the furnace after calcination or aging, and the cooling rate was tested to decrease from 5 to 1.2 to 0.15 °C/min with the temperature decreasing from 1000 to 550 to 60 °C. While for the preparation of the “c-m-a”, the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and the Pd/La-Al2O3 were calcined separately, then mixed (getting the “c-m” sample) and aged (getting the “c-m-a” sample). Also, the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and the Pd/La-Al2O3 were calcined then aged separately, finally mixed to get the “c-a-m” sample. The aging treatment was conducted to test the durability of the catalyst. 2.1.2 Monolith converter A monolith converter was made adopting the “m-c-a” strategy. In detail, the dried Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Pd/La-Al2O3 were firstly made by impregnation with Pd loading of 1.5 wt%, as shown in the previous part. Then, the two components with equal mass were mixed and dispersed in DI H2O to make a slurry, with a solid content of 40 wt%. Afterwards, the slurry was suck-coated onto a cylindrical cordierite monolith (D = 118.4 mm, L = 69 mm, 750 cells per square inch, wall thickness = 2 milli-inch, V = 0.759 L, from NGK) substrate followed by calcination at 550 ℃ in static air for 3 h. Thus, the fresh “brick” sample was obtained (Fig. S3), which was then further aged at 1000 ℃ in static air for 4 h to get the aged “brick”. The washcoat loading (solid) was 140 g/L. A “core” sample (D = 26.5 mm, L = 69 mm, V = 38 cm3) was finally cut from the “brick” for catalytic activity measurement. 2.2 Characterization Transmission electron microscope images as well as the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were collected on a JEM-1400 instrument. N2 adsorption/desorption test was conducted at − 196 ℃ with a QuadraSorb Station 1 apparatus, after the samples being treated at 300 ℃ for 1 h under vacuum. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max 2200 PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA), with a step size of 0.01 degree and a scan rate of 4 degree per minute. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an ESCAlab250 instrument, using C 1 s line at 284.8 eV to calibrate the binding energies. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem Ⅱ 2920 instrument, with 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) flowing through 50 mg of sample which was heated from RT to 850 ℃ at a ramp rate of 20 ℃/min. Before the TPR test, the samples were treated in air flow (15 mL/min) at 110 ℃ for 30 min. The ex situ Raman spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope with a 633 nm excitation length and power density of 8 mW/cm2. While the in situ Raman spectra were recorded on a HORIBA LabRAM HR 800 Raman microscope with a 633 nm excitation length. A gas mixture of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance N2, 60 mL/min in total, was fed into the sample cell that was heated from room temperature at 10 ℃/min. The dispersion of Pd was measured by CO-pulse chemisorption method. Firstly, the samples were pre-reduced in 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 200 ℃ for 1 h, then flushed by He (30 mL/min) for 20 min. After cooling down to 50 ℃, pulse chemisorption was conducted under a He flow (30 mL/min) and pulses of 0.52 mL of 5% CO/He. In order to calculate the metal dispersion, an adsorption stoichiometry of Pd/CO = 1 was assumed [27]. The actual Pd content of the catalysts was determined by Perkin-Elmer Optima 8000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Before measurement, the catalysts were digested in aqua regia at 150 ℃ to ensure a complete dissolution of Pd and then diluted to a fixed volume. Unless otherwise stated, the above characterizations were conducted over the powder samples. 2.3 Activity measurement 2.3.1 Three-way catalysis over the powder samples The reaction was conducted in a fix-bed reactor. A thermocouple was sealed in a thin quartz tube (i.d. = 1.5 mm), whose tip was placed inside the catalyst bed. Typically, 0.030 g of the catalyst (40–60 mesh) was mixed with 0.3 g of quartz SiO2 (40–60 mesh), then loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm). A gas mixture of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance He (150 mL/min in total, space velocity = 300,000 mL/h/gcat) was then introduced. The O2 concentration was decided by CO, NO and C3H6 concentration, ensuring a stoichiometric combustion condition, that is, NO and O2 were exactly consumed by CO and C3H6, and vice versa. Thus, the relative air/fuel ratio or the so-called lambda value equals to 1. After stabling for 30 min, the reactor was heated from 40 to 400 ℃ with a ramp rate of 10 ℃/min (the 1st test run, adopted to pretreat the samples). Next, the furnace was cooled down to RT, with the reaction gas keeping flowing, then a 2nd temperature-programmed reaction was conducted under the same conditions described above. A gas-chromatography (Shanghai Ruimin GC-2060) equipped with double channels was used to monitor on-line the concentration of CO and C3H6, while the NO concentration was too low to be tested accurately. One channel is for C3H6 detection by a flame ionization detector (FID) through a HP-plot Q capillary column, while the other channel with a methane converter is for CO and CO2 detection by FID through a Porapak Q packed column. 2.3.2 Three-way catalysis over the monolith samples As mentioned above, a “core” monolith sample was cut from the “brick” monolith. Typically, the aged “core” sample “m-c-a” (V = 38 cm3) was firstly fixed tightly with silica wool in a quartz tube reactor in a bench-scale catalytic reactor system. A gas mixture of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance N2 was then introduced, with a flow rate of 38,000 mL/min, thus offering a gas hourly space velocity of 60,000 h−1. After stabling for 30 min, the reactor was heated from RT to 400 ℃ (10 ℃/min), getting the activity data for “m-c-a”. After cooling to RT in the gas flow, the used “m-c-a” was obtained. Then, after stabilizing for another 30 min in the gas flow, the reactor was heated again to 400 ℃ (10 ℃/min), getting the activity for the used “m-c-a”. After the sample was cooled to RT, the sample was heated to 550 ℃ and kept for 2 h in static air. At last, the above-mentioned activity test was conducted again for this re-oxidized sample. Also, the activity test was conducted for the calcined “core” sample “m-c” for comparison. Concentration of all the gases except for N2 and O2 was tested by an infrared gas sensor (MultiGas™ 2030 FTIR Continuous Gas Analyzer). The catalysts coated were finally peeled off carefully for further characterizations. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Bulk and surface properties The XRD measurement was used for bulk structure characterization. The original curves are shown in Fig. 2A, with the derived data listed in Table 1. All of the samples showed intense diffraction peaks due to the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phase, as well as less intense peaks due to the Al2O3 phase. For the aged samples (Fig. 2A (a-c)), metallic Pd with noticeable X-ray diffraction peaks, and PdO with less intense diffraction peaks were identified (also see the zoomed-in sections in Fig. S4). The presence of metallic Pd should be because that the large crystalline size of Pd0 in the aged samples could hinder the complete oxidation of the metal in the bulk [28]. While for the calcined samples, no diffraction peaks due to any Pd-containing phase could be observed (Fig. 2A (d-e) and Fig. S4). The absence of such peaks could be ascribed to the higher dispersion and/or the weaker crystallinity of the related species in the calcined samples than those in the aged ones. Besides, it could also be found that the grain size of the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 obviously grew upon aging (Table 1), which could explain to some extent the aggregation of the Pd nanoparticles. The Raman spectra were recorded for measurement of the surface crystalline structure, in contrast to the bulk crystalline structure tested by XRD. PdO is Raman-active while metallic Pd is not. The Raman peak around 650 cm−1 (Fig. 2B) is characteristic of PdO (B1 g mode [29]), to be specific, crystalline PdO [30]. Su et al. [30] reported that the Raman peak intensity near 650 cm−1 increased with PdO content (in Pd/ZrO2), but always lagged the latter quantity, due to the presence of weak crystallinity or even amorphous PdO that is less sensitive to Raman laser. This explained why the calcined samples showed weaker Raman peak around 650 cm−1 in Fig. 2B. Although the intense Raman peak of PdO could be clearly observed in aged samples, the PdO-related XRD peaks were rather weak (Fig. S4), probably because of its low content in the bulk. The XPS test could offer the Pd valence state information on the sample surface, irrespective of the crystalline or amorphous structure, thus was conducted as complementary to XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Because of the overlap between the binding energy of the Pd 3d and the Zr 3p in the X-ray photoelectron spectra (Fig. S5), the peaks due to the Pd 3d3/2 were rather unnoticeable, so peak deconvolution was conducted only for those of the Pd 3d5/2, as shown in Fig. 2C. The peaks centered around 334.9, 336.5 and 337.7 eV could be assigned to Pd0, Pd2+ and Pd4+, respectively [31,32] (also see Fig. S5). It could be found that the Pd2+ dominated for all of the calcined and aged samples. The aged samples showed higher ratios of Pd0 than those of the calcined ones (0.29 ~ 0.37 vs. 0.14, as seen in Fig. 2C and Table 1), consistent with the observation of the metallic Pd phase in the aged samples by XRD (Fig. 2A). 3.2 Catalytic activity In industrial application, the Pd was adopted in the TWCs as active sites mainly for CO and C3H6 elimination, while the Rh mainly for NO reduction. Though focusing on Pd-based TWCs in this work, NO as well as CO2 and H2O was also introduced into the reaction atmosphere to simulate the gasoline engine exhausts. Fig. 3a and b show the light-off curves for C3H6 and CO, respectively, with T50 (the temperature at which the conversion reaches 50%) listed as inset. It was found that the two calcined samples showed similar activity, with the “c-m” sample being higher than the “m-c” sample (T50 for C3H6: 230 vs. 236 °C, T50 for CO: 186 vs. 197 °C), for both of the C3H6 and CO elimination. After aging, the activity of the “m-c-a” sample turned to surpass the “c-m-a” sample (T50 for C3H6: 258 vs. 275 °C, T50 for CO: 241 vs. 257 °C), with the activity of the “c-a-m” sample being located roughly in the middle (T50 for C3H6: 275 °C, T50 for CO: 254 °C). 3.3 Reducibility and dispersion of Pd To trace the source of the difference in catalytic activity, H2-TPR was adopted as a sensitive method to characterize the surface and bulk reducibility. As shown in Fig. S6, all the samples showed noticeable H2-TPR peaks or troughs mainly in the range of − 40–200 ℃, so, only the zoomed-in section was shown in Fig. 4a for clarity. All the curves raised up from below 0 ℃ and peaked at a low temperature in the range of 3.5–10.2 ℃. The first intense peak could be assigned to the reduction of PdO [33] and the oxides support in the vicinity. For all the studied samples in Fig. 4, the Pd content tested by ICP-OES located in 1.47–1.53 wt% (Table S1), so the maximum H2 consumption solely by PdO reduction was estimated to be 138–144 μmol/g, assuming that all the Pd species were in the form of PdO. While the real H2 consumption for the first intense peak was larger (157–243 μmol/g). It was thus proved that part of the oxides support (mainly Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 with high oxygen mobility) near the PdO could also be reduced at such low temperatures, probably due to the hydrogen atom spillover from the metallic Pd formed upon reduction [33,34]. The calcined and aged samples, especially the latter, showed negative peaks around 36–53 ℃, which could be assigned to PdH x decomposition to release H2 [34]. Although as an imperfect measurement for OSC, the H2 consumption could be adopted to estimate the OSC value. Focusing on the first intense peak (from −40 to 30 ℃), it was found that the “c-m” sample exhibited a higher H2 consumption in this range than that of the “m-c” (243 > 196 μmol/g), while the three aged ones showed similar low values (157–158 μmol/g). This higher H2 consumption of the “c-m” sample than that of the “m-c”, reflecting its higher content of active oxygen species in and near PdO, could explain to some extent the slightly higher catalytic activity of the “c-m” sample than that of the “m-c” sample (Fig. 3). With temperature further increasing, the surface and bulk lattice oxygen in the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 began to be reduced successively, leading to the continued growth in H2 consumption as shown in Fig. 4b. From around 123 ℃, the “m-c” and the “m-c-a” began to surpass the counterpart(s), and the final H2 consumption decreased in the order of “m-c” > “c-m” > “m-c-a” > “c-a-m” > “c-m-a”. This sequence was in consistence with that for catalytic activity for the aged samples (Fig. 3), indicating that the active oxygen species in the surface and bulk lattice of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 could participate in the two oxidation reactions over the aged samples. The dispersions of Pd were also compared, which could, meanwhile, help to judge whether the two components of Pd/La-Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 have been thoroughly mixed or not. For example, since the sample “c-m” was made by physically mixing calcined Pd/La-Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, it should possess a Pd dispersion equal to the average of those for the two components. If the two components were not well mixed, a mass ratio of 1:1 could not be kept when sampling the catalyst for the TPR test. The data in Fig. 5a just confirmed the well mix: the Pd dispersion of “c-m”, 27.0%, was very close to the average of those of Pd/La-Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (21.4% and 32.5%, respectively). It was also found that the “m-c” possessed a higher Pd dispersion than that of the “c-m” (31.4% > 27.0%), indicating that the Pd species may re-disperse between the La-Al2O3 and the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 during calcination at 550 ℃. Since the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 could offer an obviously higher Pd dispersion than the La-Al2O3 after calcination (32.5% > 21.4%), it is reasonable to deduce that the Pd in the “m-c” may migrate from the La-Al2O3 to the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 during calcination, just in consistence with that reported in reference [26]. Noteworthy, the bare support oxides including La-Al2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 adsorbed nearly no CO compared to the Pd-containing counterparts during the CO-pulse chemisorption test (Fig. S7). Moreover, not all of the Pd species on La-Al2O3 would move to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, since quite an amount of Pd could still be clearly found on La-Al2O3 in the calcined “m-c” sample (see the TEM-EDS mapping images in Fig. S8). The remaining Pd on Al2O3 could be vital for the catalytic activity [35]. In fact, the resultant Pd/La-Al2O3 component could benefit NO removal (Fig. S9A), and after aging the activity of the reference Pd/La-Al2O3 turned to be better than that of the reference Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (Fig. S9B), probably due to the good thermal stability of the Al2O3 support with high specific surface area. After aging, the difference in the Pd dispersion among different samples was decreased greatly. For the aged samples shown in Fig. 5b, the Pd dispersion of the “c-a-m” (4.2%) is close to the average of those values of the aged Pd/La-Al2O3 (4.6%) and the aged Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (4.0%, Fig. 5b), demonstrating the thorough mixing between the two components. The Pd dispersion of the “m-c-a” was slightly higher than that of the “c-m-a”, with values of 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Though in the calcined state, the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 could more effectively disperse Pd than La-Al2O3, the aged Pd/La-Al2O3 turned to show a slightly higher Pd dispersion than that of the aged Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (4.6% vs. 4.0%), due to the high thermal stability of the La-Al2O3 support [36]. Moreover, the “m-c-a” sample showed a Pd dispersion (4.8%) more close to that of the aged Pd/La-Al2O3 (4.6%) instead of Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (4.0%), because both the “m-c-a” sample and the aged Pd/La-Al2O3 contained the stable La-Al2O3 support. So, this finding did not contradict the above-stated Pd migration from La-Al2O3 to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 upon heating. 3.4 Kinks in the conversion-temperature curves The optimal aged sample “m-c-a” was selected to be tested at the monolith converter level in a bench-scale catalytic reactor system. The calcined counterpart “m-c” was also made and tested for reference. As shown in Fig. 6, the calcined monolith converter “m-c” showed T50 values for CO, NO and C3H6 as low as 192, 226 and 227 °C, and those values for the aged one “m-c-a” could also reach low temperatures of 253, 263 and 262 °C. Compared with C3H6 or NO, CO was easier to be eliminated over each of the catalysts. The adopted high space velocity (60,000 h−1) during the activity test and the limited Pd loading (~1.5 wt%) in the catalysts led to the high T50 values for CO (>190 °C), which were, however, acceptable for the real world application, since the gasoline engine exhaust is usually above 300 °C. For a commercial TWC converter, the catalytic activity could not be over enhanced. Otherwise, the production costs, e.g., the Pd loading, would be unbearable. Thanks to the quick-response of the infrared gas sensor (acquisition frequency was set to 2 Hz), more detailed information could be obtained, with some abnormal behaviors being unveiled. The calcined “m-c” sample showed normal conversion curves for CO, NO and C3H6, that is, conversion was monotonously increasing with temperature. While, the aged “m-c-a” sample showed kinks in the conversion curves for the three pollutants, with conversion firstly increasing then decreasing to some extent but finally increasing again as temperature was raised. Thus, peaks were formed followed by troughs in the conversion curves. However, no such kinks could be found in the used “m-c-a” sample, unless it was re-oxidized at 550 ℃ in air for 2 h. Note that the peaks appeared at exactly the same temperature for the three pollutants (all around 268 ℃ for the “m-c-a” sample, or around 249 ℃ for the re-oxidized “m-c-a” sample). Noteworthy, the three-way catalytic reaction is characterized by a stoichiometric combustion condition, that is, the oxidative species were exactly consumed by the reductive species and vice versa. Thus, a relatively reductive atmosphere was obtained, as compared to air under which the catalysts were prepared. Then, it was reasonable to infer that reduction of the catalyst should be responsible for the phenomenon. Noteworthy, the presence of serious heat or mass transfer limitations has been excluded experimentally and theoretically: (1) when doubling the linear velocity while keeping the space velocity constant, the conversion of CO, NO or C3H6 (3 ~ 5%) was almost unchanged over the representative “m-c-a” sample (discrepancy in conversion < 5%), thus excluding the presence of external mass diffusion resistance at low temperatures (<230 ℃); (2) the catalyst in a monolith converter is contained in a thin washcoat, thus has the advantage of lower internal diffusion limitation than the catalyst pellets [37]; (3) since the pollutants concentration was rather low (1000 ppm for CO and C3H6, 500 ppm for NO), the heat transfer limitation could be excluded when the conversion was kept at a low level (<10%) [38]. Similar phenomena have been reported in literature. It was found that a kink in the CO light-off curve was accompanied by a pause in the C3H6 conversion curve over the Pt-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst. The C3H6 conversion kept below 6% until the CO light-off kink was resolved at higher temperatures [39]. In that case, the kink was due to CO adsorption/desorption: CO was firstly adsorbed on Pt, leading to apparent increase in CO conversion, then it desorbed at increased temperatures, resulting in apparent decrease in CO conversion, and offering accessible Pt for C3H6 oxidation. In short, the decrease of CO conversion was accompanied by the increase of C3H6 conversion. Such adsorption/desorption-induced phenomena could also be found in Fig. 6. As highlighted in the green rectangle, CO conversion over the re-oxidized “m-c-a” sample stayed at around 60% in the temperature range of 212 ~ 234 ℃, while the conversion of NO and C3H6 was indeed enhanced. Also in this temperature range, the “m-c” sample showed just a slight increase in the CO conversion, but the enhancement in NO and C3H6 conversion was rather dramatic. However, the kinks at 268 or 249 ℃ should be due to change in the catalyst itself, since the CO, NO and C3H6 conversion curves changed in an almost synchronous manner, with the peaks in the curves appearing at exactly the same temperature for the three pollutants over either the aged “m-c-a” sample or the re-oxidized “m-c-a” sample. The evolution of the kinks in Fig. 6 is closely related to that of the crystalline PdO Raman peak at 649 cm−1 ( Fig. 7A). When the peak appeared, the kinks appeared correspondingly, and when the peak disappeared, the kinks disappeared simultaneously. Noteworthy, the “m-c-a” sample restored the crystalline PdO Raman peak after re-oxidation at the expense of metallic Pd (Fig. 7B, Pd + 0.5 O2 = PdO). Meanwhile, the dispersion of Pd was also restored, even surpassing the original “m-c-a” sample (7.2% > 4.8%, Table S1). This result explains the improved activity for the re-oxidized sample as compared to the original aged “m-c-a” sample, with the temperature where the kinks began to appear being lowered from 268 to 249 ℃. To make it more clear, in situ Raman was conducted to characterize the state of the Pd under reaction conditions. The spectra (Fig. 7C) collected during the reaction over the “m-c-a” sample showed the gradual weakening of the crystalline PdO Raman peak. It totally disappeared around 260 ℃, rather close to 268 ℃ where the kinks began to appear over the “m-c-a” sample. The disappearance of the peak was not caused by the increased temperature, since it could keep stable at 500 ℃ for a long enough time (Fig. S10). Thus, it was further confirmed that the reduction of crystalline PdO led to the kinks. The reactions occurring in a TWC converter are rather complex, including the oxidation of CO, H2 and hydrocarbon with O2 or NO, as well as the side reactions like steam reforming of hydrocarbon and water gas shift [40]. The PdO could be more active than Pd for the simultaneous elimination of CO, NO and hydrocarbon. As reported in literature, PdO is highly active for CO [41] and hydrocarbon [42] oxidation. Besides, Tang et al. [43] reported that PdO nanoparticles and Pd–O–Ce solid solution are responsible for the high catalytic activity for NO + CO reaction. Besides, Matam et al. [44] found that CH4 and NO emissions would both increase upon PdO reduction into Pd. So, the appearance of the kinks could be explained as follows: the highly active PdO species, stable under the reaction atmosphere at low temperatures, could effectively catalyze the three pollutants elimination, realizing a conversion of above 50%; while, as the temperature was further increased, PdO changed into less active Pd, making conversion decrease to some extent (the above mentioned complex reactions be hindered), and when the temperature reached high enough values, the conversion could be restored by reviving the complex reactions. 3.5 Conclusion In conclusion, given that the Pd would migrate between the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and the Al2O3 at high temperatures, the strategy to mix the Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and the Pd/La-Al2O3 components for preparing highly active TWCs has been studied. Compared with the “calcination-mixing-aging” and the “calcination-aging-mixing”, the optimal strategy of “mixing-calcination-aging” could offer higher Pd dispersion, oxygen storage capacity and catalytic activity for C3H6 and CO elimination, probably by ensuring the sufficient Pd migration, thus resulting in the compact interaction between Pd and the mixed supports (Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and La-Al2O3). So, this facile mixing strategy could be eligible for industrial applications, as was confirmed at the monolith converter level. Thereinto, kinks showing the transient conversion drop with increasing temperature were found in the conversion curves in the same temperature range for the CO, NO and C3H6 during the three-way catalytic reaction over the “mixing-calcination-aging” monolith converter. While, such kinks were absent over the calcined counterpart “mixing-calcination”, and they also disappeared for the used “mixing-calcination-aging” sample, but could be restored upon re-oxidation of the used sample. The ex situ and in situ Raman spectroscopy provided convincing evidences, demonstrating that the crystalline PdO reduction during the reaction is responsible for the phenomena.

        "dc:description": "As the two main components in typical three-way catalysts, Pd-Al2O3 and Pd-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 usually show different Pd-support interaction strength. Thus, Pd could re-distribute between Al2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 upon heating. Here the strategy to mix Pd/La-Al2O3 and Pd/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (before or after calcination, or after aging) was researched. The optimal choice was “mixing-calcination-aging”, offering the highest oxygen storage capacity, Pd dispersion and catalytic activity for CO and C3H6 elimination during the three-way catalytic reaction. Thus, the “mixing-calcination-aging” strategy holds promise in industrial applications, as demonstrated at the monolith converter level. The transient drop in conversion with increasing temperature (“kink”) appeared simultaneously for CO, NO and C3H6 over the “mixing-calcination-aging” monolith, but did not over the calcined counterpart “mixing-calcination”. The kinks disappeared for the used “mixing-calcination-aging”, but could be restored upon re-oxidizing. By virtue of the in situ Raman characterization, the reduction of PdO under the reaction conditions was found to cause the kinks.",
