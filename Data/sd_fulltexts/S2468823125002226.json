Plasma-catalytic ammonia decomposition has witnessed substantial progress over the past decade, focusing on improving catalytic efficiency and achieving rapid start-stop operation capabilities under practical conditions. Despite these advancements, the mechanistic understanding of plasma-catalyst synergy remains a critical gap. This study investigates the synergy effects in a hybrid ammonia decomposition reaction utilizing dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma coupled with Ru/Fe pellet catalysts. Through comprehensive analysis of this rarely understudied all-metal catalyst system, we reveal that plasma discharge primarily occurs along the ceramic reactor wall periphery rather than within the catalyst bed, as evidenced by high-speed imaging diagnostics. The predominant energy conversion pathway involves heating activation of thermal catalytic process, demonstrating an absence of synergistic enhancement in the one-stage reactor configuration. Notably, a two-stage reactor design exhibited plasma-induced pre-activation of NH3, leading to observable synergistic effects. However, the overall efficiency for hydrogen production deceased in the two-stage reactor configuration. This study provides valuable insights into the development of all-metal catalysts or catalysts with high metal loading for plasma catalytic ammonia decomposition or other potential applications.

However, the transportation and storage of chemically active hydrogen gas poses numerous challenges [1–3]. Ammonia possesses a higher hydrogen content (17.8 wt. %) compared to other hydrogen-containing compounds, such as methanol (13.3 wt. %) and water (11.1 wt. %), etc., coupled with its facile liquification properties under relatively mild conditions, making it an attractive option for hydrogen storage [4–7]. The utilization of ammonia decomposition for hydrogen production offers advantages such as zero COx emissions, effectively addressing greenhouse gas concerns, while also preventing Pt catalyst poisoning in PEMFC by CO, thereby extending fuel cell lifespan. Consequently, ammonia is considered an ideal carrier for hydrogen in various scenarios related to hydrogen energy application [8,9]. However, in the absence of an appropriate catalyst, the decomposition of ammonia generally requires a high temperature (ca. 700 °C) to overcome the reaction activation energy, in which a large part of energy is consumed, resulting in reduced energy efficiency. Although conventional catalytic ammonia decomposition presents a promising option [10,11], further improvements of existing processes are demanded to meet the growing demand for rapid on-site hydrogen production. To facilitate chemical reactions at low temperatures, atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma has been combined with a conventional catalytic reaction system, as reported in various gas phase reactions such as NOx decomposition [12,13], VOC decontamination [14–16], CO2 conversion [17,18], NH3 synthesis [19–21] and NH3 decomposition [22,23]. In these applications, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is widely employed for constructing plasma-catalyst hybrid systems, since catalysts can be easily integrated into a typical coaxial DBD reactor. Upon discharge on dielectric catalyst pellets where the electric field is concentrated, transient micro-discharges propagate along the catalyst surface. On one hand, high-energy electron impacts generate various excited species that exhibit enhanced interactions with the catalyst compared to conventional catalytic reactions [24,25]. This interaction is considered the main reason for reaction enhancement in plasma-catalyst hybrid system at lower temperatures. On the other hand, nonthermal discharges are known to generate heat that promotes catalytic reactions [26], even replacing conventional furnace heating through internal heating mechanisms. Noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Ru, Rh, Ir) and none noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe) dispersed on dielectric oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, BaTiO3) are extensively utilized as active catalyst for ammonia decomposition in both conventional catalysis and plasma-catalysis systems [27–33]. Catalyst materials play a crucial role not only in the reactivity of ammonia decomposition in terms of catalysis [34,35], but also in the discharge mechanism of plasma formation within a packed bed in a plasma-catalyst hybrid system, thereby significantly influencing electron properties and subsequently impacting chemical reactions [20,29]. Remarkably, the dielectric properties of the catalyst materials have been shown to influence the discharge process substantially [36,37]. Zhang et al. reported that for metallic catalyst coatings, surface discharge is more localized compared to dielectric materials with small relative permittivity (εr ≤50), due to very weak surface charging [38]. Sungkwon et al. found that the presence of Pt particles in a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst reduces the electric field strength and thus the methane conversion efficiency compared to bare Al2O3 in a DBD reactor [39]. This suggests the need to reassess the synergistic interactions between plasma and conductive catalyst. Consequently, a more comprehensive evaluation of the impact of all-metal conductive catalyst, which have received limited attention, on the synergistic effect of plasma catalysis would enhance our understanding of plasma-catalyst interactions. From these perspectives, the present study investigates the utilization of a DBD bed reactor in combination with a Ru/Fe metal catalyst for ammonia decomposition. Although both ruthenium and iron have been utilized as supported active catalysts for both thermal catalytic and plasma catalytic ammonia decomposition [23,26], limited studies have explored the effects of metallic ruthenium and iron on discharge characteristics and plasma-catalytic reactivity when iron pellets are embedded within a DBD reactor. The behavior of iron pellets is expected to exhibit significant differences compared to dielectric catalyst materials in a plasma-catalyst hybrid system. Consequently, this disparity will likely impact the plasma discharge and plasma-catalyst synergistic effect during ammonia decomposition. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic iron pellet catalysts also demonstrate rapid Joule heating and hysteresis heating in alternating magnetic fields within the DBD reactor. This characteristic effectively mitigates the issue of poor temperature responsivity commonly encountered with conventional furnace heating. Such enhancement is expected to facilitate the practical application of metallic iron-based catalysts in on-site hydrogen generation and ammonia-hydrogen combustion engines [40,41]. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of ammonia decomposition in conventional thermal catalytic and plasma-catalytic systems using a millimeter-scale Ru/Fe metal catalyst. Specifically designed DBD reactors, including one-stage and two-stage types, were employed to investigate the synergy effects and hydrogen production energy efficiency. Our research primarily focuses on characterizing the discharge behavior and elucidating the mechanism behind the synergistic effect observed in all-metal catalyst systems. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation The spherical iron pellets (99.9 %) with diameters of 0.5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm were purchased from Guangzhou Metal Metallurgy Co., LTD. A total of 10 g of iron pellets were added to a mixture solution containing RuCl3 (3.5 mol L−1, Shanghai Meryer) and HCl (8.0 mol L−1), with a volume of 6 mL. The resulting mixture was initially stirred at room temperature for 36 h and then heated at 50 °C for an additional 18 h to achieve evaporation until dryness. Subsequently, the sample underwent heating at a rate of 10 °C min−1 until reaching a temperature of 500 °C, followed by calcination for a duration of 5 h before cooling down to room temperature. The obtained catalyst precursors with approximately 2 wt. % Ru content are denoted as Ru/Fe-0.5, Ru/Fe-1, and Ru/Fe-2, respectively. As a control iron catalyst prepared under identical conditions but without the addition of Ru, it is labeled as Fe-1. Prior to being subjected to the ammonia decomposition test, the catalyst precursors were reduced under H2 atmosphere (40 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1.5 h. The term “fresh catalyst” in the following refers to catalyst prior to hydrogen reduction, while the term “spent catalyst” refers to the catalyst subsequent to the ammonia decomposition reaction. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The catalyst structures were analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (Bruker D8 Advance). The XRD patterns were obtained with a step size of 0.02 °, scanning time of 0.2 s, over a range of 2θ=10–90°, at a tube current of 40 mA and tube voltage maintained at 40 kV. Catalyst surface morphology and elemental analysis were investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM, KYKY-FM6900) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, EDAX Octane Super). Surface elemental information of the catalyst was also characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5000 Versa Probe II) with Al Kα radiation, and the binding energy was calibrated using a C 1 s line at 284.6 eV. The static hysteresis curves of the Ru/Fe catalyst were measured using a Lake Shore 8604 series Vibrating-Sample Magnetometer (VSM). Measurements were conducted within the range of –1.0 T and +1.0 T in order to determine the sample's mass magnetization and coercivity. 2.3 Experimental setup The setup details of the packed bed reactor for ammonia decomposition in combination with DBD have been described elsewhere [32]. In brief, Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram illustrating the configuration. Spherical Ru/Fe pellets (8 g) were tightly packed within an Al2O3 ceramic tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm and an outer diameter of 12 mm. The filling length of the Ru/Fe catalyst inside the tube was measured to be 40 mm. Coaxially positioned inside the bed was a high voltage electrode (a stainless-steel rod measuring 2 mm in diameter), whereas outside the ceramic tube, a grounded electrode (a thin stainless-steel sheet) was securely wrapped. Moreover, the reactor was tightly enveloped with insulated cotton to minimize thermal losses, and a thermocouple was fixed to the GE for continuous monitoring of the reactor wall temperature. A high alternating voltage (supplied by CTP-2000 K, Corona lab) at an approximate frequency of 10 kHz was applied to drive the discharge and ammonia decomposition reaction. The NH3 feed gas was controlled at a constant mass flow rate of 40 mL min−1, and gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Panna A91plus) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Ammonia conversion was determined using external standard method [33]; each measurement was replicated three times, with an error margin below 2 %. In the case of plasma-only NH3 decomposition reaction, no catalyst was employed. Regarding thermal-catalytic NH3 decomposition, the same reactor with a catalyst bed was employed and heated by furnace. The plasma and catalyst synergistic capability (synergy factor, X) is defined as the conversion of NH3 in the case of plasma-catalysis, divided by the sum of NH3 conversions in the cases of plasma-alone and thermal-catalysis, as denoted in Eq (1). (1) X = α N H 3 ( p − c ) α N H 3 ( p ) + α N H 3 ( c ) where α N H 3 is the NH3 conversion. For the observation of plasma discharge inside the DBD reactor, a quartz tube with similar dimensions was employed in lieu of the ceramic tube. High-speed photographs and videos capturing the plasma discharge within the reactor were obtained using a state-of-the-art camera (NAC Image Technology Inc., Memrecam ACS-1) equipped with a Nikon lens (AF 24–85 mm f/2.8–4D IF). The video was captured at a frame rate of 500 frames per second and a resolution of 1280 by 896 pixels. The temperature distribution of the DBD reactor during NH3 decomposition was also assessed utilizing forward-looking infrared radar technology (FLIR, A600-Series). Optical emission spectra (OES) of the NH3 plasma were monitored using a spectrograph (Avantes, AvaSpec) in the wavelength range of 250–750 nm. The emitted light was collected by a lens which positioned approximately 4 cm from the upper edge of the plasma and subsequently transmitted to the multi-channel spectrometer via an optical fiber. All electrical signals were sampled by a four-channel digital oscilloscope (Tetronix MSO2024B). The COMSOL Multiphysics numerical simulation was employed to model the potential distribution within the DBD reactor, with the surface potential of the high-voltage electrode set to 6 kV. All scale settings are consistent with actual reactor conditions; however, variations in catalyst shape and arrangement were not taken into account. The relative dielectric constants (εr) of the insulating medium (Al2O3), reaction gas, and catalyst (iron pellet) were assigned values of 9.8, 1, and approximately infinity [42], respectively. 3 Results and discussion The SEM images of the fresh and spent Ru/Fe catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 (a-d) and Figure S1. Upon ruthenium loading and ammonia decomposition reaction, the surface of the iron pellet exhibited a noticeable increase in roughness compared to its initial smooth state (Figure S1a). The resultant rough coating layer displayed a porous microstructure, which could facilitate the distribution of Ru, thereby beneficial for enhancing catalytic performance. As depicted in Figure S2, the EDS results demonstrate the successful deposition of ruthenium onto the iron surface. Subsequent to ruthenium loading and calcination procedures, the catalyst precursors underwent severe oxidation in air, as indicated by the high oxygen content observed in the Ru/Fe-1 fresh sample (Fig. 2e and f). In the spent sample, a substantial reduction in oxygen content was observed on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, an increase in nitrogen content suggested that iron nitrides was formed during the ammonia decomposition reaction. These findings are consistent with XPS investigations shown in Fig. 2g–j. In the spent Ru/Fe-1 catalyst, the appearance of the N 1 s peak at a binding energy of 397.8 eV can be attributed to the presence of metal nitride. In the fresh Ru/Fe-1 catalyst, the Fe 2p3 peak observed at a binding energy of 711.0 eV, along with its typical satellite peak, can undoubtedly be assigned to Fe3+. However, after ammonia decomposition reaction, a small Fe 2p3 peak emerged at a lower binding energy value of 708.7 eV in the spent catalyst, suggesting the formation of iron nitride in conjunction with the N 1 s peak signal. Based on deconvolution analysis of Ru 3d peaks, both RuO2 and RuCl3 were detected in the fresh Ru/Fe-1 catalyst; whereas for the spent catalyst, it is evident that ruthenium primarily exists as RuO2 due to natural oxidation upon exposure to the atmosphere after reaction. The XRD results of the fresh and spent catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2k and Fig. S3, are in good consistence with the previous EDS and XPS findings. The surface of the iron pellet in the fresh catalyst precursors predominantly exhibited α-Fe2O3 (PDF 96–210–1853). In the case of Ru/Fe-1 catalyst precursor, a minor diffraction peak at 28.04 ° can be attributed to RuO2 (PDF 96–210–1853). Upon hydrogen reduction, the XRD pattern of the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst revealed distinct peaks corresponding to Fe (PDF 96–900–2672) and Ru (PDF 96–900–8514) phases. After ammonia decomposition reaction, two iron nitrides were identified in the spent catalyst: Fe24N10 (PDF 96–231–0872) and Fe6N2.6 (PDF 96–900–4226), respectively. It has been documented that iron nitride tends to form on iron catalysts after the ammonia decomposition reaction [35]. The magnetic properties of the fresh and spent Ru/Fe-1 catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2l, both revealing a soft ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. This behavior primarily originates from the bulk iron pellet. Compared with the fresh catalyst, a lower saturation magnetization (Ms) was identified for the spent Ru/Fe-1 catalyst, resulting from the change in intrinsic magnetic behavior of surface iron species, namely Fe2O3 and metallic iron nitrides FeNx. Furthermore, both catalysts exhibit similar coercivity (Hc) values around 15 Oe, with a slightly higher value observed for the spent catalyst. Consequently, the Ru/Fe catalyst could enable efficient magnetic heating under high-frequency AC field within the DBD bed reactor. Firstly, the performance of thermal-catalytic ammonia decomposition using these iron-based catalysts were investigated, as shown in Fig. 3 a. Compared to the bare iron catalyst, Ru/Fe catalysts greatly promoted the reaction performance, and the conversion of ammonia increased from 25 % to around 65 % at the reaction temperature of 520 °C, demonstrating the superiority of ruthenium over iron. The thermal-catalytic activity of the Ru/Fe catalysts for ammonia decomposition in the high reaction temperature range (from 420 °C to 520 °C) exhibits a different ranking order, with Ru/Fe-1 demonstrating the highest activity followed by Ru/Fe-2 and then Ru/Fe-0.5, as compared to that observed in the low temperature range. Several factors associated with catalyst size can influence their thermal catalytic activity, including the specific surface area of the catalyst, catalyst filling length (Table S1), and gas residence time, etc. The specific surface areas decreased in the sequence of Ru/Fe-0.5 > Ru/Fe-1 > Ru/Fe-2, indicating a reduction in available surface reaction sites. On the contrary, an increase in catalyst pellet size resulted in a longer catalyst bed length, which enhanced gas residence time. These combined factors contributed to the observed differences in thermal catalytic performance among the Ru/Fe catalysts as depicted in Fig. 3a. Based on these findings, the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst was selected for further investigations into plasma-catalysis. Fig. 3b shows the comparison of thermal-catalytic and plasma-catalytic NH3 conversion over the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst. The thermal reaction was conducted at the same temperature as that measured on the ceramic tube wall during the plasma-catalytic reaction under various input powers. At lower discharge power of 24 W, the plasma catalytic ammonia conversion outperformed the thermal catalytic performance, primarily attributed to the reaction via plasma discharge. Notably, at elevated discharge powers, no significant synergy effect between plasma and catalyst was observed, different from previous literature reports; moreover, the reactivity of plasma-catalysis even slightly decreased compared to that of thermal-catalysis at higher temperatures. Considering that the temperature inside the catalyst bed is typically lower than the reactor wall [32], it can be inferred that the ammonia decomposition conversions achieved in both energy input modes were nearly identical, indicating a lack of additional activation effect provided by plasma. The Fe-1 catalyst also exhibited a similar trend, as illustrated in Figure S4. Plasma-catalytic ammonia conversion was slightly higher than thermal catalysis at input powers of 24 and 26.4 W, but it became lower at 28.8 and 31.2 W. The absence of synergy in the iron pellet-based catalysts was subsequently investigated by analyzing their discharge behaviors. Fig. 3c and d illustrate the measurement of electrical signals, including voltage and current, with and without the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst at a fixed discharge power of 31.2 W. Notably, the presence of iron pellet catalyst led to a pronounced attenuation in discharge, as evidenced by a significant reduction in both the amplitude and quantity of current pulses, thereby indicating limited discharge (also refer to Fig. 4 ). It can be explained that the use of metallic catalyst prevents surface charging on the catalyst pellet within the catalyst bed, and poses significant challenges to plasma formation within the pores around the packed iron pellets [38,43]. Besides, when utililzing the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst, a remarkable displacement current is observed (Fig. 3d), in contrast to the conditions of a bare DBD reactor (Fig. 3c). As documented in previous studies, the metal-like Mo2 N catalyst [44], the Fe/Al/Ti foam metal catalysts [45], and the 26 wt %-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [37], all packed in a DBD reactor, have previously shown a similar phenomenon, with their surfaces demonstrating strong metallic characteristics, akin to the Ru/Fe catalyst studied here. The efficient electron transport between iron pellets suggests that a significant portion of electrical energy was consumed and converted into heat, potentially through mechanisms of Joule heating and hysteresis heating on iron pellets. Consequently, it was inferred that under the given reaction conditions ammonia decomposition with the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst was primarily driven by heat, resulting in an absence of detectable plasma catalytic synergy phenomenon (Fig. 3b). The Lissajous figures of the discharge, with and without Ru/Fe-1 packing, are presented in Fig. 3e at a constant discharge power of 31.2 W. When iron pellets were packed in the plasma reactor, the shape of the Lissajous figure for the discharge transformed from a parallelogram to an oval shape, exhibiting increased reactor capacitances during both discharge-off and discharge-on phases (Table S2). As discussed earlier, the presence of metal catalyst facilitated charge transfer between electrodes, resulting in significantly higher energy efficiency (Q = Pout/Pin) of 79.4 % compared to the discharges without catalyst packing which achieved only 49.7 %. Next, the discharge behavior was visually observed using a “two-stage” reactor design, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The above-mentioned ammonia decomposition reactions were conducted in the one-stage DBD reactor, which had a discharge length of 40 mm (equivalent to the filling length of the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst). In order to observe and compare the characteristics between the bare DBD discharge and the Ru/Fe pellet embedded reactor, the two-stage reactor was designed with an extended ground electrode (measuring 70 mm) while maintaining all other conditions constant. High-speed camera images captured at different times from both zones are shown in Fig. 4d, and e for the empty zone, and Fig. 4g, and h for the catalyst zone, with an exposure time of 5 ms for each photograph. As depicted in Fig. 4d, intense filamentary discharges were observed surrounding the inner high-voltage electrode of the empty zone and expanded throughout the space. Additionally, bright surface discharges were evident near the tube wall. In contrast, in the catalyst-packed zone, only dim surface discharges were observed near the ceramic tube wall, as shown in Fig. 4g. These observations strongly indicate that plasma discharge is significantly attenuated when packing Ru/Fe metal catalyst in a DBD reactor. Plasma generation is confined to the narrow spaces between the catalyst particles and the ceramic tube wall. The limited discharge is considered insufficient to achieve a significant plasma synergy effect under the given reaction conditions. Consequently, within the catalyst bed, the efficient heating of the metal catalyst within the high-frequent AC circuit primarily promotes the ammonia decomposition. The spatial distribution of electric potential and field intensity in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactors was systematically investigated through COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 4i, j, and Figure S5. In the empty DBD reactor configuration (Fig. S5), the electric field exhibited a continuous gradient distribution, with maximum intensity observed near the high-voltage electrode and a gradual radial decrease towards the tube wall. This distribution pattern results in the most intense gas ionization and most prominent discharge phenomena occurring on the outer side of the high-voltage electrode within the empty zone, which is consistent with the experimental observations captured by high-speed camera imaging (Fig. 4c–e). In the one-stage reactor configuration (Fig. 4i), the conductive nature of the Ru/Fe catalyst resulted in equipotential characteristics between the catalyst bed and the internal electrode. This configuration established a distinct potential gradient primarily localized at the discrete interfacial regions between the reactor tube and iron pellets. Consequently, the localized electric field distribution led to plasma discharge phenomena predominantly occurring near the reactor wall in the catalyst-packed zone (Fig. 4f–h). The two-stage reactor configuration (Fig. 4j) demonstrated similar electric field distribution patterns in both empty and catalyst bed zones, albeit with reduced field intensity values. For modeling simplification, the Ru/Fe catalyst was treated as an extension of the inner electrode in these simulations. The simulation results provide a comprehensive explanation for the constrained discharge behaviors within the catalyst bed, which aligns well with experimental observations (Fig. 4c–h). Notably, the electric field intensity profile revealed a maximum value at the front end of the catalyst bed, indicating enhanced discharge activity at this interfacial region. This localized intensification of electromagnetic interactions at the plasma-catalyst interface establishes a fundamental mechanism for achieving plasma-catalysis synergy in the two-stage reactor system, as will be further discussed in subsequent sections. Subsequently, the two-stage reactor was employed to systematically investigate the synergy effects of ammonia decomposition over Ru/Fe catalyst under different reaction modes (plasma-only, thermal catalysis, and plasma catalysis). The comparative analysis of NH3 conversion rates is presented in Fig. 5 a. At lower discharge powers (24 W and 26.4 W), the plasma-only reaction demonstrated considerable reactivity with around 10 % NH3 conversion, resulting in an apparent synergy factor of approximately 1. However, at elevated discharge powers (28.8 W and 31.2 W), plasma-catalytic ammonia decomposition exhibited significantly enhanced reactivity compared to both thermal catalysis and plasma-only reactions, demonstrating a pronounced synergistic effect with synergy factors (X) exceeding 1. These results suggested that plasma facilitates additional reaction pathways in the two-stage reactor configuration. The observed non-linear relationship between input power and synergy factor arises from the complex interplay among three reaction components (direct plasma-driven, thermal-catalytic, and plasma-preactivated reactions), along with the increasing dominance of thermal-catalysis at higher power levels, which is consistent with findings reported in the literature [33,46]. To elucidate the plasma enhancement mechanism for ammonia decomposition, plasma-phase OES was employed to characterize the NH3 DBD palsma. Fig. 5b presents the OES spectra of NH3 palsma in the presence of the Ru/Fe-1 catalyst at various input poweres. As evidenced by Fig. 5b and Figure S6, the plasma generated NH3-related species, including excited NH3* (564–567 nm, Schuster's band) [47], NH2⋅ (610–670 nm, NH3 α band) [48] and NH⋅ (336 nm, A3Π→X3S−) [49], were observed within the empty zone of the two-stage reactor. Among these species, NH3* exhibitied the most intense emmision. The observed synergy effect, as shown in Fig. 5a, is potentially attributed to the migration of these pre-activated species from the front end of the catalyst bed to the catalyst surface. This hypothesis is further supported by Fig. 5c, which shows that the intensity of the excited NH3* species increased proportionally with input power, corresponding to the observed enhancement in synergy factors. The thermal profile within the two-stage reactor during plasma-catalytic ammonia decomposition was monitored through a narrow observation window opened on the uninsulated ground electrode (Figure S7). Comparative analysis revealed a distinct temperature gradient between the catalyst zone and the empty plasma region, with the former exhibiting lower temperatures. This thermal disparity is attributed to the dominant occurrence of the endothermic ammonia decomposition reaction within the catalyst bed. Furthermore, the observed synergy effect (Fig. 5a) may be mechanistically linked to the reduced energy density in the two-stage reactor configuration, which effectively lowers the catalyst bed temperature (Figure S8) and consequently suppresses thermal catalytic activity. These findings collectively indicate that while plasma-catalysis synergy was achieved in the two-stage configuration, the compromised energy density inherent to this design resulted in suboptimal catalytic performance. This hypothesis is corroborated by the significantly lower overall NH3 conversion rates observed in the two-stage reactor compared to the one-stage system, as quantitatively demonstrated in Fig. 5d (as well as Figure S9). From the perspective of improving energy utilization efficiency, the rapid heating of all-metal catalysts in an alternating electromagnetic field is particularly advantageous for practical applications, especially with ferromagnetic materials. Moreover, this method facilitates rapid start-up and shutdown procedures. 4 Conclusion A ruthenium-modified iron pellet (Ru/Fe) catalyst was fabricated via deposition synthesis and subsequently implemented in DBD packed-bed reactors for plasma-catalytic ammonia decomposition. Systematic investigation of plasma-catalysis synergy in this fully metallic system revealed distinct mechanistic pathways dependent on reactor configuration, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6 . In the one-stage reactor configuration, plasma characterizations and real-time discharge imaging demonstrated limited plasma activity within the catalyst bed, with predominant energy conversion occurring through Joule heating and hysteresis heating mechanisms. This thermal dominance, coupled with the exceptional intrinsic activity of the Ru/Fe catalyst, drove ammonia decomposition predominantly via conventional thermal pathways, as evidenced by the absence of measurable synergy effects. In contrast, the two-stage reactor configuration enabled enhanced plasma-catalyst interaction through spatial decoupling of discharge generation and catalytic processes. As revealed by in-situ plasma characterization, activated ammonia species (NHx*) generated in the upstream plasma zone migrated to the Ru/Fe surface, establishing a synergistic reaction pathway. However, the two-stage reactor resulted in reduced overall energy efficiency, giving lower NH3 conversions at equivalent input powers compared to the one-stage reactor. These findings establish critical reactor configuration-performance relationships for metallic catalyst systems in plasma environments: For highly active conductive catalysts like Ru/Fe-1, strategic optimization of energy allocation toward thermal activation proves more effective than pursuing plasma-catalytic synergy. This fundamental understanding not only elucidates the complex interplay between plasma physics and catalytic chemistry in metallic systems but also provides essential guidelines for designing DBD reactors optimized for electrically conductive catalyst.

        "dc:description": "Plasma-catalytic ammonia decomposition has witnessed substantial progress over the past decade, focusing on improving catalytic efficiency and achieving rapid start-stop operation capabilities under practical conditions. Despite these advancements, the mechanistic understanding of plasma-catalyst synergy remains a critical gap. This study investigates the synergy effects in a hybrid ammonia decomposition reaction utilizing dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma coupled with Ru/Fe pellet catalysts. Through comprehensive analysis of this rarely understudied all-metal catalyst system, we reveal that plasma discharge primarily occurs along the ceramic reactor wall periphery rather than within the catalyst bed, as evidenced by high-speed imaging diagnostics. The predominant energy conversion pathway involves heating activation of thermal catalytic process, demonstrating an absence of synergistic enhancement in the one-stage reactor configuration. Notably, a two-stage reactor design exhibited plasma-induced pre-activation of NH3, leading to observable synergistic effects. However, the overall efficiency for hydrogen production deceased in the two-stage reactor configuration. This study provides valuable insights into the development of all-metal catalysts or catalysts with high metal loading for plasma catalytic ammonia decomposition or other potential applications.",
