(+ 7-383) 2355756, e-mail: LIKHVL@CATALYSIS.NSK.SU (Received July 2,1993; accepted July 23,1993 ) Abstract Computer simulation has been applied to the interpretation of \"spots on stems\" images observed in HRTEM micrographs of a catalyst containing PtC12 complexes anchored on phosphinated silica. Molecular models of isolated molecules P2 or P$ PtClz (P$=diphosphine ligand covalently attached to the amorphous Si02 layer), aggregates (\"islands\") of anchored Pt (II ) complexes, [P$-PtC12 ] (n=2-5 ), and metal clusters Pt (n=1-20) attached to the Si0z surface via a graphite \"stem\" were constructed. Multislice programs were used to simulate HRTEM images of these models. The comparison of real images obtained using a JEM-100CX microscope with those simulated for various models shows that experimental HRTEM micrographs exhibit Pt metal clusters on graphite \"stems\". These objects appear to be the products of decomposition of initial [P2 PtC12 J \"islands\" under the electron beam. The results emphasize the necessity of computer simulation for correct interpretation of HRTEM images, especially when the objects are sensitive to the heating effects of the electron beam. Key words: HRTEM images; platinum; simulation; silica-anchored complexes Introduction A few years ago we applied high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to the study of anchored platinum catalysts [ 1 ] . Such catalysts were obtained by anchoring platinum (II) complexes on a silica surface modified with diphosphine ligands P2, as follows: P2 + (PhCN) 2 PtC12 -* P2 * PtC12 + 2PhCN where P2 = I -Sl (OEt) [ (CH2) 3PCy2) 2, I -Si is a silicon atom bound to the hy- *Corresponding author.

Fig. 1 shows an HRTEM micrograph of the catalyst containing chloride complexes of Pt (II) anchored on phosphinated silica. The images of some finely dispersed agglomerates (looking like \"spots on stems\") are seen against the background of Si02 globules. In ref. 1 these images were assumed to be the aggregates (\"islands\") of platinum complexes elevated above the silica surface on hydrocarbon chains of the anchored phosphine ligands. To confirm that the suggested structure indeed agrees with the real HRTEM image one usually applies the image simulation techniques [2-8]. Here we have tried to give a more plausible interpretation of the experimental HRTEM images obtained in ref. 1 via their simulation and comparison of real and model pictures. Fig. 1. High-resolution micrograph of a sample containing PtC12 anchored on phosphinated S'02Bar represents 5 nm. The print includes computer images (a-d) based on a model of the [Pt] / graphite \"stem\", where n=5 (a), 10 (b) and 20 (c,d). (See text for further discussion.) The simulated images were calculated at defocus values D, = -120 nm (a-c) and DZ- -192 nm (d). A.L. Chuuilin et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 Experimental 233 Construction of a \"pseudo-unit cell\" and model of amorphous silica The calculation of the images of nonperiodic objects require the construction of a \"pseudo-unit cell\" with sufficiently extended dimensions, necessary for the application of discrete Fourier transform and convolution in the calculation procedure [ 4 ] . Moreover, while choosing the cell parameters one should also consider the topography of species anchored on phosphinated silica. According to spin-label technique [9 ], luminescence analysis [ 10 ] and IR spectroscopic [ 11 ] data, the anchored ligands and metal complexes fixed on them are not distributed uniformly or randomly over the silica surface, but are concentrated as \"islands\" with 5-8 ligand (or complex) molecules on average. The reasons for this \"island\"-type distribution of organic ligands covalently attached to a silica surface have been discussed by Yermakov et al. [ 12 ] . Estimations based on spin-label data [9 ] show that the distance between the points of ligand attachment in an \"island\" do not exceed 0.8-1.0 nm, the \"island\" diameter being 2.0-3.0 nm, the distance between neighboring \"islands\" being 3.0-4.0 nm. Taking the above considerations into account, we have chosen the size of \"pseudo-unit\" cell for modeling the piece of amorphous silica encompassing one \"island\" as x xy X z = 5.0 X 2.5 X 2.5 nm3 (or 5.0 X 5.0 X 5.0 nm' in one case discussed below). Here, x is the parameter in the direction normal to the Si02 surface, y X z is the area of the support surface, z pointing in the electron beam direction. The atomic positions (Si and 0) for the amorphous Si02 were randomly generated, but with the conditions that the building units of this structure were Si04 tetrahedra and that the model volume (\"pseudo-unit cell\") was filled as the unit cell of an infinite crystal. The generation of Si and 0 atoms continued according to these rules until the \"pseudo-unit cell\" was 2/5 filled 2.5 m Y~ 5 nm model surtace structures Fig. 2.

The remaining volume was used for constructing the molecular models of surface species. Models of structures dispersed on Si02 surface The following molecular models were constructed: (1) isolated molecules of P2 and P2 PtC12, ( 2 ) [P2 PtC12 ] n \"islands\", n = 2-5, and ( 3 ) ligandless PtR clusters on a graphite \"stem\", n=1-20. Illustrations of examples of these molecular models are shown in Fig. 3a-c. The bond lengths and angles required for PC molecular modeling of anchored ligand PZ were taken from ref. 13. Molecular models of mononuclear complex Pa PtC12 and dimer [ P2 PtCl2 ] 2 were designed on the basis of experimental X-ray diffraction studies of cisPtCl2(PCy3)2 [14] and traps-[Pt2(,U-Cl)2(Cl)2(PPh3)2] [15], respectively. Models of aggregates [P2 PtCl2]n (n=3 or 5) were arranged from model PZ PtC12 configurations. Models of Ptn clusters were taken as the fragments of bulk platinum structure. \"Stems\" for PtR clusters were constructed as pyramids consisting of graphite-like carbon layers, each carbon atom being slightly shifted from the exact crystallographic position. 236 A.L. Chuuilin et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 Simulation of HRTEM images The HRTEM images were simulated using a standard multislice program with fast Fourier transforms [ 16 ] , which was written by one of the authors (A.L.C.) for the IBM PC MS-DOS system. The calculations were performed according to the same parameters for a JEM 1000CX as used in the experiment [ 1 ], they were: 100 kV accelerating potential, 2.8 mm spherical aberration coefficient, 2.5 nm-1 objective aperture radius, 0.5 mrad semi-angle of beam convergence, 5.0 nm half-width of Gaussian spread of defocus. The slice thickness was 0.413 nm (six slices per unit cell), the projected potential was sampled through 0.02 nm. Diffracted beams out to 0.25 nm-1 were taken for the multislice procedure. According to the test, with slice thickness more than 0.8 nm and the 0.02 nm projected potential sampling, our calculations were found to provide satisfactorily reproducible results for the objects of up to 25 nm thickness at least. Here, the calculations were performed mainly for the electron beam passing through the six sequent \"pseudo-unit cells\" with x Xy X z = 5.0 X 2.5 X 2.5 nm3 each. Five of them represent a \"pure\" Si02, while the sixth one contains the surface agglomerates, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The only exception is the HRTEM image simulation of a surface agglomerate containing as many as 20 Pt atoms. In this case the electron beam was considered to pass through three cells with x X y X z = 5.0 X 5.0 X 5.0 nm3 each. Two of them contained \"pure\" silica, and one contained silica with a Pt cluster on it. Thus, the thickness of the silica layer along the beam direction was always considered to be equal to 15 nm.

(I) amorphous Si02 profile; (II) anchored Pa ligand; (III-V) [P$ PtC12] \"islands\" at n-2 (III), 3 (IV) and 5 (V), respectively. For all models the images were calculated with Schemer defocus (Dl - -120 nm ) and larger underfocua (D2 - -192 nm ) . 238 A.L. Chuuilin et al. /J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 the calculated HRTEM images of the silica surface profile containing no anchored ligands or complexes. We first investigated the visibility of the isolated anchored P2 ligands and P2 ' PtC12 monomers. Fig. 5 reveals that, as we expected earlier [ 1 ] , the isolated molecules of these species are invisible. When modeling \"islands\" of anchored PZ ' PtC12 complexes, we have found that the 2.5 X 2.5 nm' area of the support surface cannot encompass more than five Pz or P2-PtC12 molecules due to the steric requirements for bulk cyclohexylphosphine ligands. This is in good agreement with the experimental data [ 18 ] on the estimation of the maximum amount of phosphine ligands covalently anchored by the reaction of excess silylated phosphines with silica. The maximum loading is less than a monolayer coverage and depends on the steric peculiarities of these ligands. The simulated HRTEM images of [ PZ ' PtClz ] n \"islands\" (n= 2, 3 or 5, see Fig. 5) are dark stripes parallel to the silica surface and placed at ca. 0.6 nm distance from its visible edge. When the defocus is deviated from the Scherzer defocus value no significant changes are observed in the images. The image contrast increases with an increase of n. A comparison of simulated images of [ P2 * PtC12 ] n \"islands\" with the experimental ones shown in Fig. 1 reveals some significant differences. The experimental micrograph exhibits nearly spherical dark spots (spot diameter ca. 0.6-0.8 nm) interpreted in ref. 1 as the images of Pt (II) aggregates. Near the edges of support globules one can notice that these spots are not lying on the surface of globules but are located at some distance on \"stems\" which have poor contrast (the height of the \"stems\" is in the range 1.0-1.5 nm; the width of \"stem\" bases at the Si02 surface is 1.0-2.0 nm). The spot images exhibit significantly darker contrast and are very much further removed from the support surface than computer simulated strips of [P2 PtC12 ] R \"islands\". No \"stem\" images can be distinguished on the computed micrographs. Hence, the suggested model of [ P2 PtCl2 ] n \"islands\" does not comply with the real objects observed with the electron microscope. It is well known [ 19 ] that anchored silylphosphine ligands are sot very thermally resistant and decompose at temperatures higher than 473 K. As a result of surface ligand degradation the low-valent metal complexes stabilized by these ligands are immediately decomposed under reductive conditions with the formation of metal particles of different sizes [20]. Since in the electron microscope the sample is exposed to intensive irradiation, causing considerable local heating [21 ], the anchored complexes may decay during the exposure. This could be the reason for the discrepancy between the simulated and experimental images mentioned above. The size increase and shape changes of images followed by the structural damage (sintering) of initial objects have been observed earlier [ 22 ] when the samples were exposed to the electron beam. In our case, we observed no changes of HRTEM images upon the exposure of the sample to the electron beam, but, however, we cannot avoid the decay of the anchored complexes before visual observation of the images. A.L. Chuuilin et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 239 In order to check this decay hypothesis, we have generated the molecular models of Pt metal clusters which could be formed on the silica surface following the decomposition of [ P2 PtC12 ] R \"islands\". We considered that the decomposition products of organic ligands remained on the silica surface, forming \"stems\" for the aggregates of Pt atoms. To simplify the model, we assumed that the \"stems\" are composed exclusively of carbon atoms organized into graphite-like structures. In the proposed models of Pt clusters on graphite \"stems\" (see Fig. 3c) the number of carbon atoms in the \"stem\" is connected with the nuclearity of the Ptn cluster as around 40 carbon atoms per single Pt atom, since the monomeric complex P2 PtCl2 includes 40 light atoms, except very light hydrogen and atoms belonging to silica matrix (Si and O) . Fig. 6 presents the simulated HRTEM images for the models of Ptn clusters on graphite \"stems\". In case when n=1 or n=3 the images have a very poor contrast and completely disappear, even at small underfocus. Such images cannot be visible under the normal experimental conditions. At n=5,10 or 20 the simulated images are rather distinct as spherical dark spots on conical \"stems\" of lower contrast. Both the contrast of images and their dimensions (spot diameter, \"stem\" height and width of its base) tend to increase with increasing n. The simulated HRTEM images in Fig. 6 apparently fit with the experimental ones. The similarity of the computed and real images is even more pronounced, if simulated images are superimposed on the experimental micrograph of a sample containing anchored Pt (II) complexes on phosphinated silica, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, our hypothesis about the transformation of [ P2 PtCl2 ] n \"islands\" to ligandless Ptn clusters when exposed in the electron beam, seems to be in accordance with the experimental observations. As was mentioned in ref. 1, the sizes of spot images in the experimental HRTEM micrographs of anchored Pt catalyst vary within a rather wide range, possibly owing to variation in size (nuclearity) of the surface metal aggregates. In principle, one could estimate the nuclearity distribution of these aggregates via a direct comparison of their real images with those simulated for models of Ptn clusters at various n. However, this comparison appears to be ambiguous, since various factors can affect the real image, but were not taken into account during the simulation procedure. Indeed, the oscillations of Pt aggregates on \"stems\" tops induced by the heating effect of the electron beam should cause diffusion of the image [ 1 ] . Hence, one may expect the real image of Ptn cluster to differ in terms of a larger size and less contrast than those of the corresponding simulated image. Moreover, the exact defocus value is not known; it is hard to estimate it from the experimental micrograph. Our calculations (see Fig. 6 ) show the size and contrast of \"spots on stems\" images are highly sensitive to defocus value. The possibility of accounting for all these factors mentioned above during the computer simulation of HRTEM images of dispersed metal aggregates will be the subject of future investigations. 240 II I V A.L. Chuuilin et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 Fig. 6. Projected potentials (p.p. ) in the electron beam direction and simulated HRTEM images (Dl and D2) for models of Pt clusters on graphite \"stems\" at n-1 (I), 3 (II), 5 (III), 10 (IV) and 20 ( V ) , respectively. The images were simulated with Scherzer defocus (D, - -120 nm ) and larger underfocus (D2- -192 nm ). Conclusion Computer simulations have been used to investigate the origin of \"spots on stems\" images observed in HRTEM micrographs of a catalyst obtained by anchoring Pt ( II ) complexes on phosphinated silica. The calculations were carried out using a multislice procedure. A 150 A thick layer of amorphous Si02 was generated by a random Si04 tetrahedra algorithm and filled part of a predetermined volume (\"pseudo-unit cell\"); this layer was considered as the supporting material for the different model structures (i.e. isolated molecules of A.L. Chuvilin et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 231-242 241 P2 Or P2 * PtC12, [ P2 * PtCl2 ] R \"islands\" or ligandlesa Ptn clusters on graphite \"stems\", n= 1-20) . The image simulation apparently shows that neither isolated P2 * PtC12 complexes nor [ P2 PtC12 ] n \"islands\" can be the objects of experimental \"spots on stems\" images. On the contrary, the computed images of model Pt clusters on graphite \"stems\" are essentially similar to the experimental ones. Thus, we suggest those clusters are actually the objects responsible for \"spots on stems\" images. The most probable reason for the appearance of such objects may be the sensitivity of anchored complexes to the heating and reduction effects of the electron beam. The observed objects (Pt metal particles on carbon \"stems\") can be the products of thermal decomposition of initial [ P2 PtC12 ] n complexes. This conclusion casts doubt on the application of HRTEM for direct observation of delicate objects such as metal complexes anchored by organic ligands; in any case, the images obtained should not be interpreted intuitively. Of course, the lack of possibility for the direct observation of [P2 PtC12 ]n \"islands\" by HRTEM does not deny the real existence of such aggregates. Moreover, since we considered the [P2 PtC12 ] n \"islands\" as precursors of Ptn clusters on graphite \"stems\", the good correlation of simulated images calculated for these models with real ones is one more indirect item of evidence of the \"island\" type distribution of anchored metal complexes over a silica surface.

Computer simulation has been applied to the interpretation of “spots on stems” images observed in HRTEM micrographs of a catalyst containing PtCl2 complexes anchored on phosphinated silica. Molecular models of isolated molecules P2 or P2 ·PtCl2 (P2 = diphosphine ligand covalently attached to the amorphous SiO2 layer), aggregates (“islands”) of anchored PT(II) complexes, [P2 ·PtCl2] n (n=2–5), and metel clusters Pt n (n=1–20) attached to the SiO2 surface via a graphite “stem” were constructed. Multislice programs were used to simulate HRTEM images of these models. The comparison of real images obtained using a JEM-100CX microscope with those simulated for various models shows that experimental HRTEM micrographs exhibit Pt n metal clusters on graphite “stems”. These objects appear to be the products of decomposition of initial [P2 ·PtCl2] n “islands” under the electron beam. The results emphasize the necessity of computer simulation for correct interpretation of HRTEM images, especially when the objects are sensitive to the heating effects of the electron beam.
