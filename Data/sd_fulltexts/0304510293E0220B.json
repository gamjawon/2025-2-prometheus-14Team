Bezouhanova* and F.A. Jabur University of Sofia, Faculty of Chemistry, 1, J.D. BourchierAve, Sofia 1126 (Bulgaria) (Received March 26, 1993) Abstract The dehydration of 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (pinacol) on LaHY, CaHY and HZSM-5 zeolites has been investigated in the temperature range 393-438 K in solvent-free liquid phase. The formation of pinacolone (3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone) and of 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene was observed. The higher activity of Y faujasites was followed by considerable deactivation, while that of HZSM-5 remained constant. Key words: dehydration; pinacol; zeolite catalyst Introduction The rearrangement of vicinal diols to carbonyl compounds having a changed carbon skeleton proceeds in acid media via carbenium ions [ 1 ] . The trend to the replacement of the corrosive acids by solid ones has been reported in some recent publications [ 2-5 ] . The activity and selectivity of Al\" -montmorillonite, arylsulfonic derivative of silica and of a sulfonic resin of polystyrene in pinacol rearrangement was strongly dependent on the nature of the catalyst's active sites and on its topology [ 3 ] . The advantage of the zeolite as catalysts for organic synthesis is due to their controllable topology and surface structure [5 ] . Among zeolites of different types (A, X or Y) containing different cations, the most active in diol conversion were found to be HY [5] and LaHY zeolites [4 ] . The dehydration of six simple methyl-substituted 1,2-diols proceeds with higher selectivity on Y than on X faujasites [2]. The sodium forms of both types of zeolites were also active. No data on zeolite catalyst deactivation were presented, although the higher coking ability of HY zeolites is described in the literature [ 6 ] . The aim of our investigation was to test the activity of zeolites of pentasil type (HZSM-5) in pinacol rearrangement and to compare the activity, selectivity and deactivation with those of Y zeolites containing polyvalent cations (La, or Ca). The pinacol molecule is rather bulky and it was not known whether *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. SSDI: 0304-5102 (93) E0220-B 40 C.P.

On the other side it is well known that the polyvalent cations stabilize the structure of faujasite and improve the catalytic activity in industrial cracking. Experimental Catalysts The zeolite ZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) was kindly supplied by the Czechoslovak Research Institute for Oil and Hydrocarbon Gases (Bratislava). Its H-form was prepared by room temperature treatment with 0.6 M HCl solution. The zeolite structure was confirmed on the basis of the IR spectra obtained in KBr, following the procedure given in ref. 7. The IR spectra of self-supporting wafers evacuated at 673 K contained a band at 3600 cm-' which characterized the presence of bridging OH groups, capable of acting as Bronated acid sites. LaHY and CaHY were obtained from NaY by ion exchange with solutions of NH4C1 and the corresponding chlorides according to the procedure described in ref. 8. They were characterized by the IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine [ 9 ] . The catalyst composition was determined by chemical analysis (atomic absorption analysis of sodium, EDTA titration of calcium and lanthanum as oxalate) and is presented in Table 1. Catalytic experiments The catalytic experiments were performed in a round-bottom flask fitted with a thermometer and an efficient reflux condenser. Anhydrous pinacol (Fluka) was added to the zeolite catalyst which had previously been pressed, crushed, sieved to 8-14 mesh, activated at 723 K under flowing air and cooled to the reaction temperature. The highest reaction temperature corresponded to the boiling of the reaction mixture.

Bezouhanoua and F.A. Jabur / J. Mol.

IR spectra and reference substances were used for the identification of the products. 41 Results and discussion The experimental results revealed that in the presence of the zeolite catalysts the pinacol conversion proceeds in two parallel directions: dehydration to ketone (pinacol rearrangement ) and to diene (2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene ) . The zeolites displayed different activities, selectivities and degrees of deactivation during the course of these reactions. Influence of catalyst/pinacol ratio Measurements using different weight ratios of catalyst to pinacol were performed in order to compare the activity of the zeolite catalysts investigated ( Fig. 1) . It appeared that LaHY was the most active catalyst, corresponding to the concentration of acid sites found, which was higher than in CaHY [8, 9]. The lower activity of the zeolite HZSM-5 might be explained by the constraints which the pore size place on the pinacol molecules. The formation of pinacolone and 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene was observed in the presence of the three zeolites studied ( Table 2 ) .

Influence of temperature We have found (Fig. 1) that at 423 K the pinacol conversion increased in the presence of a larger amount of zeolite. The use of more catalyst might allow the temperature of the reaction to be decreased (Fig. 2). On LaHY the con- C.P. Bezouhanova and FA. Jabur / J. Mol. CataL 87 (i9O) 39-46 43 version reached 80% after 4 h at 393 K. Under these conditions the conversion after 3 h on HZSM-5 became higher than that on CaHY - an indication of the slower deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite. At 438 K a conversion of pinacol in the range 93-100% was achieved after 4 h. Deactivation of zeolite catalysts The selectivity of pinacolone formation was higher for LaHY (Fig. 3 j, while HZSM-5 showed moderate activity: a behavior similar to that of CaHY. Only after a longer contact time did its selectivity approach that of LaHY. In the case of LaHY and CaHY the deactivation began after 2 h (Fig. 3 ). Our results on pinacol conversion in the presence of Y and HZSM-5 zeolites are in favour of faujasites as catalysts. The activity and selectivity of LaHY was the best. A somewhat better activity and selectivity of HZSM-5 zeolite was found only after longer contact times. The pinacolone formation was always accompanied by dehydration of the glycol to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene (Fig. 4 ). In the presence of HZSM-5 the yield of diene is higher at smaller contact time and decreased further relatively to pinacolone formation. The opposite relationship was observed for CaHY and LaHY: more diene was formed on CaHY. The role of the reaction products (water, diene, ketone) on zeolite catalyst deactivation should also be considered. The faujasites CaHY and LaHY are more hydrophilic than HZSM-5 and adsorb water more strongly. The fact that the activity of the faujasites was always higher than that of HZSM-5 (Figs. 1-3) indicates that the deactivation of faujasites cannot be explained by their hydrophilic properties. On the other hand, water formation is known to prevent coking of HZSM-5. Data on diene formation (Table 2, Fig. 4) showed substantial differences between faujasites and HZSM-5, especially in relation to the contact time. In this respect HZSM5 zeolite displayed some advantages. It is known that the narrow pores and the lower acid site concentration in HZSM-5 are the reason for its low coking t0 0 o_ 090.

Parallel to the decrease of diene yield with time (Fig. 4) the activity of H ZSM-5 zeolite in pinacol conversion remained almost constant or increased (Fig. 5) without any intermediate regeneration for 4 h. The differences between the faujasites and HZSM-5 were especially remarkable after longer use (Fig. 6). The activity of HZSM-5 in pinacol conversion remained almost constant after 20 h (with intermediate regeneration), while LaHY and CaHY showed considerable deactivation and lower regeneration ability. These results also support the suggestion that the deactivation of faujasites is not related to water adsorption, which could be easily desorbed, but that deposition of heavier carbonaceous residues causes the deactivation. Another factor which influences the deactivation might be ketone adsorption, given the polar nature of C.P. Bezouhanova and PA. Jabur / J. Mol.

It is logical to suppose that the deactivation of the catalysts must depend on diene formation, considered as a coke precursor. Conclusions Acid forms of Y faujasites and ZSM-5 zeolites activate the pinacol rearrangement, accompanied by diene formation. The activity and selectivity of Y faujasites is superior to that of HZSM-5 zeolite. The deactivation of the zeolite catalysts does not essentially depend on the differences between the hydrophilic faujasites and hydrophobic HZSM-5. The presence of water prevents coking on HZSM-5, but on this zeolite, too, diene yield is lower at higher contact times. The combination of these two processes maintains a constant activity for HZSM-5 after longer use. Diene yield is lower on HZSM-5 at longer contact times. References 1 J.
