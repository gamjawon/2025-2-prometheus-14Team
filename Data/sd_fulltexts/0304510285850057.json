P. C. BOOTSMA, G. CHALLA** Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry, State University at Groningen, Nijenborgh 16, 9747 AG Groningen, (The Netherlands) and F. MULLER Department of Biochemistry, Agricultural University, De Dreijen 11, 6703 BC Wageningen, (The Netherlands) (Received January 11, 1986; accepted July 23,1986) Summary Several styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers of different texture have been functionalized with a flavin-coenzyme model. The activities of these insoluble reactive polymers as catalysts for the oxidation of the model sub- strate l-benzyl-l,4-dihydronicotinamide were tested in water/2-propanol mixtures. The highest reaction rates were observed for flavin bound to a macroreticular resin of small particle size, and the lowest for a highly cross- linked gel-type support. Besides the influence of porosity and particle size, that of sorption behaviour of substrate on reaction rates is discussed. It is suggested that only those sites located at the outer surface of the various supports, still being in contact with the aqueous medium, play an active role in the model reaction. From the effect of medium composition on reaction rates and substrate sorption/desorption behaviour, it is concluded that sorption of substrate to a resin bead does not necessarily result in higher effective concentrations in the vicinity of the active sites, and therefore does not always lead to an increase of reaction rates. Introduction Since Merrifield introduced the concept of solid phase synthesis on a gel-type copolymer of styrene crosslinked with some divinylbenzene [I], this type of copolymer has frequently been used as a support material for immobilizing reactive species, although the low crosslink density and \" Part 6: Polymer, 26 (1984) 961. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 328 hydrophobicity may be serious drawbacks [2,3]. Several other types of supports have been developed, some of them by using more polar and hydro- philic monomers. Nevertheless, most commercial resins are still based on the styrene/divinylbenzene system, since their physical structures may be opti- mized for the desired application [2, 3]. Three distinct types of insoluble polymeric supports may be distinguished, each with positive as well as negative aspects [2, 4, 5]: (i) Lightly crosslinked, gel-type resins. These particles can swell in solvents appropriate for the corresponding homopolymer, and only then they are porous. These so-called micropores are the liquid-filled spaces between the polymer chains in the network. The degree of functionalization of this type of polymer can be varied up to rather high values, but the pendant groups are only accessible in the swollen state of the network, and even then reaction rates at the internally situated active sites may be diffusion-limited. (ii) Macroreticular polymer supports are porous even in the dry form, and can be used in solvents as well as non-solvents. This permanent porosity can be introduced by addition of porogenic agents during the suspension copolymerization of, for example, styrene and rather high amounts of divinylbenzene (10-60 mol%). These spherical beads are composed of agglomerated microparticles with free space between them, which accounts for their porosity. The polymer resins therefore cannot be regarded as homo- geneous; subsequently introduced active sites may be located on the surface of the pore walls or inside the polymer matrix [3, 6, 7]. Two types of mass transport for substrates can be designated, viz. (a) internal diffusion through the liquid-filled macropores and (b) permeation from the surface of the pore into the highly crosslinked polymer matrix. The internal diffusion may be unhindered if the pore diameter is large compared to the dimensions of the substrate molecule, and if the chemical rate is not too high [2, 8]. On the other hand, slow permeation through the crosslinked polymer matrix may have a negative effect on the overall reaction rate, because in this case a number of active sites will not participate in the reaction. (iii) Linear non-crosslinked macromolecules anchored onto an inert insoluble support material can be regarded as a third class. When this type of support is applied in a solvent for the linear polymer, homogeneous reaction conditions are provided for the active sites that are bound to the macro- molecular chain. In this way all sites can be thought to be identical with respect to their microenvironment and accessibility [3, 5, 9]. A disadvantage may be the limited choice of the reaction medium. The physical structure of the inert support will determine whether or not diffusional limitations will influence the reaction rates. In the course of our study on the effects of a polymer on the physical and chemical properties of a flavin-coenzyme model covalently attached to it, we have used supports based on dissolved or adsorbed linear polystyrene [10-13]. The activity of these reactive polymers as redox catalysts was tested by using the aerobic oxidation of l-benzyl-l,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) in aqueous solution as a model reaction (Scheme 1). 329 0, CpHs S ^N^N^0 ^ N\\% (Flox) 0 ^ C2H5 1 H , <i ^N^N^0s\\X,'\" \"'-'0 Scheme 1.

The Merri- field resin (2% DVB, 2.63 meq g~1 Cl) was obtained from Polysciences. The nonporous copolymer 5 was prepared by Mr K. Knol in our laboratory by suspension copolymerization of styrene (40 g) and commercial divinyl- benzene (40 g, containing 45% ethylvinylbenzene) in 750 ml of water in a cup-blender (at 85 C during 4 h). The suspension was stabilized with 1.0 g poly(vinyl alcohol) (Mowiol 10-98 obtained from Hoechst, M = 48 500) and benzoylperoxide (0.75 g) was used as the initiator. After repeated washing (with water, acetone and methanol) and drying, the beads were sieved into a fraction of 50 -100 Jum diameter. The first step of the functionalization of these copolymers (except for the Merrifield resin), consisted of chloromethylation of the phenyl nuclei, see Scheme 2. For chloromethylation we prefer to follow the procedure described by Galeazzi [14], because this does not involve the handling of the carcinogenic chloromethyl methyl ether. We have described the experimental (P>-^> * CH30CH20CH3 ^ SOC1; znc1?. (P>-^0>-CH2Cl products Scheme 2. details of this reaction in earlier papers [10,15]. The copolymers were further functionalized by reaction with 10-ethylisoalloxazine in dry DMF in the presence of K^CO^ during one week at room temperature in the dark [10] (Scheme 3). After washing and extracting with water, DMF and methanol, the residual unreacted chloromethyl groups were allowed to react with excess diethylamine in DMF during one week. Then the beads were again washed and dried.

There- fore, the (active) flavin content of the resins 1 - 5 was estimated from the conversion of the anaerobic oxidation of BNAH, performed under the same conditions as the aerobic kinetic measurements (see next section). Under strictly anaerobic conditions flavin cannot be regenerated to its oxidized form, so each active site can react with only one substrate molecule. For these determinations, we used a Schlenk-type reaction vessel connected to a quartz cuvette by a tube containing a sintered glass filter (P4). Before starting the reaction by injection of substrate, all solutions (suspension) were carefully degassed by repeating a freeze-thaw procedure at least five times, combined with vacuum-purified N3 alternation at freezing temperature. The concentration of product was determined spectrophotometrically (Pye- Unicam SP 8-200) 10 min after initiation, by measuring the characteristic absorptions of unreacted substrate BNAH (Xmax = 358 nm, e = 7400 M~1 cm\"1; X = 262 nm, e = 2200 M~1 cm\"1) and product BNA* (Xmax = 262 nm, e = 4250 M~1 cm\"1) in the reaction medium (water/2-propanol 90/10 at 25 C) that had been filtered into the cuvette (preliminary experiments showed that after this time the conversion was complete). From the amount of product formed, we calculated the flavin content of the copolymers 1 - 5. (The number given is the average of at least 4 experiments.) This method should give a reasonable indication of the number of active sites that con- tribute to the observed initial reaction rates under aerobic conditions. Kinetics The initial reaction rates of the aerobic oxidation, of BNAH catalyzed by the insoluble flavin-containing polymers were measured by monitoring the consumption of dissolved oxygen in the reaction volume with a YSI 5331 Oxygen Probe [11]. Standard reaction conditions were chosen in order to compare the activities of the various resins. Typically, an aliquot of BNAH dissolved in 2-propanol was injected into a magnetically stirred sus- pension of 20 mg of insoluble flavin catalyst in 6 ml aqueous medium thermostatted at 25 C, and the oxygen concentration recorded. In all exper- iments the reaction medium was a water/2-propanol mixture (9/1 vol.% unless stated otherwise) buffered atpH 8.0 with tris(hydroxymethyl)amino- methane/hydrochloric acid. The ionic strength was adjusted to J= 0.05 M (KC1), and [BNAH]o = 4 - 40 X 10~5 M. From the measured initial reaction rates, feoi,s was derived (defined for standard conditions). Batchwise re-use of the polymer 1 was performed by decanting the supernatant solution after completion of a kinetic determination, washing the polymer with the standard reaction medium, and drying overnight. Before a new run was performed, the polymer beads were first wetted with 0.6 ml 2-propanol in order to displace the air from the pores, and then the aqueous buffer solution (5.4 ml) was added. 332 Sorption/desorption of substrate The sorption behaviour of the substrate was studied as a function of the solvent composition by using a HP-50 resin identical to sample 2, except that no flavin-groups were introduced. Therefore after chloromethylation all chloromethyl groups were reacted with excess diethylamine. Sorption (and desorption) of BNAH onto (and from) a specified amount of polymer was determined spectrophotometrically from the observed decrease in concentra- tion in the aqueous bulk solution, 2 min after addition of an aliquot of BNAH solution. Then the bulk solution was removed and a fresh amount of aqueous solvent was added. After 2 min of shaking, the desorbed amount of substrate was determined. The sorbed (and desorbed) amount was expressed as mg BNAH per g of dry resin (mg g~1). Results and discussion Functionalization The formaldehyde dimethylacetal, used as a reactant and as reaction medium for the chloromethylation, is a good solvent for polystyrene and is able to swell the crosslinked polymers. It is therefore assumed that the intro- duced chloromethyl groups are more or less homogeneously distributed over the resin, that is, not only on the surface but also in the interior of the polymer matrix. The coupling of the flavin model was carried out in dimethylformamide, which is also a solvent for polystyrene. Nevertheless, only low degrees of loading could be obtained since the coupling reaction is very slow. After functionalization with flavin, the residual unreacted chloromethyl groups had to be removed, as these groups may cause undesired reactions,, for example a substitution reaction with the substrate used in kinetic experiments. For this purpose the chloromethyl groups were aminated with diethyl- amine. This simple reaction does not cause side reactions with the flavins under the experimental conditions used. Not all chlorine atoms could be removed from the macroreticular resins in this way, but the remaining chlorine atoms should originate from much less reactive groups, which do not interfere with the model reaction. In another publication [15] we have shown that such groups result from addition of chloromethyl methyl ether, formed in situ during the chloromethylation procedure, to unpolymerized vinyl groups still present in this type of copolymers. From the results of chlorine and nitrogen analyses, we are able to estimate a residual vinyl group content of 0.7 and 1.2 mmol g~1 for the commercial resins XAD-2 and HP-50, respectively. Kinetics The kinetics and mechanism of our model reaction, the oxidation of l-benzyl-l,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH), have been studied by several authors [16,17]. Under aerobic conditions, reduced flavin is very rapidly 333 reoxidized by dissolved oxygen, and can therefore be considered a catalyst for the oxidation of the substrate. The reaction can be described by the Michaelis-Menten scheme for enzyme catalysis (Scheme 4), although satura- tion kinetics are not always experimentally observed. Saturation of reaction rate ro with increasing substrate concentration was found for a semi-synthet- ic flavoenzyme [18], and we have reported this type of kinetics for flavin- containing poly electrolytes [10-12]. Simple second-order kinetics are commonly found for reactions with low molar mass flavins [16, 17] due to a low concentration of the flavin-substrate complex (high value of K^, see Scheme 4). fei fe, Flox + BNAH ^ (Flox-BNAH) - > HzFl^d + BNA-1- fc_i H fast HaFl^ed + Ot > Flox + HaO; . ... , ,. , fe2[FloJ[BNAH]o initial reaction rate ro = K^ + [BNAH]o ifK^ (= (fez + fe-i)/fei) > [BNAH]o, then L ro = [Flox]lBNAH]o=felFlox]lBNAH]o=feobslBNAH]o \" m Scheme 4. Second-order kinetics are also found for BNAH oxidation catalyzed by the insoluble flavin-containing copolymers 1 - 5. Under aerobic conditions [Flox] = constant and the observed rate is first-order in substrate. In Table 1 the observed first-order rate constants feobs are given (for standard reaction conditions). The relative values of these rate constants may not be surprising when one considers that the various supports have different characteristics, and that the reaction medium is not a solvent for polystyrene. Under this condi- tion the chains of a polystyrene network are collapsed and aggregated, which strongly reduces the (micro )porosity of gel-type resins. Permeation of sub- strate will be very slow, so pendant active sites may be considered to be buried in the interior of the rigid polymeric matrix, and as a result only the flavin groups situated at the surface and/or in a thin layer directly under the surface can participate in the model reaction [2, 3,19-21]. The reaction rates observed for the macroreticular polymers 1-3, with permanent porosity and high surface area, are therefore higher than the rates found for the gel-type copolymers 4 and 5.. For a more quantative explanation, one should have more insight into the actual number of active sites that contribute to the observed oxidation rates. An estimated active flavin-content of the resins was calculated from 334 Fig. 1. Estimated active-flavin contents of the various resins (as found under anaerobic conditions) versus the observed reaction rate constants under aerobic conditions; I* and 2* represent resins ground to 30 - 70 JUm after modification, see Experimental for further details. the conversion of substrate under anaerobic conditions (see Experimental). A plot of these flavin contents versus the experimental feobs values shows a linear relationship (Fig. 1). This result suggests that all flavin groups that actually participate in the oxidation reaction have the same activity, and consequently the same microenvironment and accessibility, regardless of the structure of the resin. It is conceivable, therefore, that the sites inside the polymeric matrices are not active due to restricted permeation, and that active sites are located only on the surface of the various resins where they are in direct contact with the aqueous medium and dissolved substrate and oxygen. For macroreticular or macroporous resins, some authors have stated that about 30% of all pendant sites will be located on the pore surface [6, 7]. It is likely, however, that not even all surface sites of resins 1 and 2 can participate in the reaction, due to diffusional limitations, although a higher rate of sorption than rate of oxidation of substrate was observed (see later). This must be concluded from the influence of particle sizes (highest rate observed for 3), and the effect of grinding the beads (1 and 2). Although the pores of this type of resin have a large average diameter (Table 1), not all pores need to be equally accessible. Because the voids in the resins are formed by a phase separation process, which results in an aggregate of cavities interconnected by narrow channels, the pores should be regarded as ink-bottle shaped voids instead of smooth cylindrical channels [2-4]. Thus, the sites located on pore walls in the interior of a bead may be more or less isolated, and substrate transport to them negligible. Indeed, we found that after grinding the resins 1 and 2 (average particle size about 30 - 70 Mm), both reaction rates and active flavin contents increase, see I* and 2* in Fig. 1. Thus, when the diffusion pathlength for substrate molecules is decreased, more flavin groups become accessible. In this view a step-function rather than a distribution in accessibility of sites is assumed. The latter is often regarded to be most likely, but the former may well be possible in this 335 case. In highly aqueous media there will be no diffuse surface layer on the pore walls, because pendant chains are collapsed and aggregated in non- solvents. The effect of grinding on observed reaction rates is larger for 1 than for 2 (ratio feobs for 1*/1 = 3-5, for 2*/2 = 2.0), which may be related to the larger, and more accessible, pores of the HP-50 resin. In a previous communication [13], we arrived at the same explanation for the effect of particle sizes on reaction rates observed for a linear flavin- copolymer adsorbed on a macroporous silica carrier. (In this case all intro- duced sites are located at the interface between silica and aqueous solution.) Sorption of substrate Immobilization of reactive groups on crosslinked rigid matrices is often found to have a negative effect on the intrinsic activity [2, 3]. A hydro- phobic polystyrene resin can also be expected to have a retarding effect on the rate-determining hydride transfer from substrate to flavin [16,17], but this may be compensated for by local concentration effects, due to sorption of the apolar BNAH from aqueous solution to the resin, caused by hydro- phobic interactions [10,12,22]. In fact, macroreticular resins such as XAD-2 have been developed for application as polymeric sorbents for removal of apolar contaminants from water [23, 24]. The sorption of BNAH from aqueous solution to macroreticular resins appeared to be almost quanti- tative and rather fast. From experiments wherein the oxidation of BNAH catalyzed by 1 or 2 was followed spectrophotometrically, it appeared that the rates of product formation (pyridinium salt) were in accordance with the oxidation rates as calculated from oxygen consumption measurements, but that the simultaneously monitored decrease in substrate concentration, i.e. the uptake of substrate by the resin, was significantly faster than the oxida- tion rate. In Fig. 2 we present an example of the uptake of BNAH by a HP-50 resin (identical to sample 2 but without flavin groups) as a function of the medium composition, determined under kinetic conditions. From highly aqueous solutions, high amounts of BNAH are sorbed (after about 30 min almost quantitatively), but the amount of sorption decreases strongly upon addition of the cosolvent 2-propanol, probably because the hydrophobic interactions are weakened. When after sorption of substrate the beads are isolated and then treated with an equal amount of the water/2-propanol mixture of the same composition, the sorbed BNAH could only partly be recovered (see Fig. 2). This hysteresis observed for the sorption/desorption behaviour may be an indication that (part of the) BNAH is bound rather tightly to the hydrophobic matrix when sorbed from highly aqueous solutions. In earlier papers we also reported on the binding of BNAH to water- soluble polystyrene derivatives [10,12]. The influence of the 2-propanol content of the medium on the variation in substrate binding is identical for both soluble and crosslinked copolymers. The reaction rates of BNAH oxida- tion catalyzed by these soluble flavin-containing copolymers varied accord- ing to medium composition, that is, the highest rates were observed in the 336 0 20 W 60 80 '00 % ( \"/ ) 2 - p r o p a n o I Fig. 2.

In contrast, the effect of the medium on BNAH oxidation cata- lyzed by 1 or 2 appears to be much less pronounced (Fig. 3). Upon decreas- ing the 2-propanol content from 40 to 10 vol.% the reaction rates increase, as was expected considering the variation in substrate binding and the medium effects on intrinsic reaction rates [12,16]. However, when the amount of cosolvent is further lowered, a small rate retardation is actually observed, instead of a further increase in rate. We think this should be related to the observed hysteretic sorption/desorption behaviour, that is, a strong, almost irreversible binding of part of the substrate.

The (small amount of) substrate bound to the polymer from a solution containing 40 vol.% 2-propanol can almost completely be removed again, simply by treating with an equal volume of that same solvent mixture, whereas from highly aqueous solutions most of the bound substrate cannot be recovered by this procedure with the corresponding solvents. Substrate sorbed by a resin from highly aqueous solutions can only be stripped off when the 2- propanol content in the 'washing' solvent is increased to about 40 vol.%. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5 by a step-wise increase in the 2-propanol con- tent in the desorbing solvent mixture applied to identical samples of resin with sorbed substrate. Thus, from highly aqueous solutions part of the sorbed BNAH is quite strongly bound, probably not (only) adsorbed at the polymer/solvent inter- face, but rather absorbed in the crosslinked sub-surface layers. Absorption may result in a relatively lower mobility of the bound molecules, and a relatively lower effective substrate concentration, and thus in a decrease in reaction rates (Fig. 3). Indeed, we experimentally observed that when all substrate in the bulk phase was consumed, but not yet completely converted to pyridinium salt, another fraction was still bound by the resin, and from that point the rate of product formation significantly decreased. In the present view, the actual reaction should take place predominantly at the interface of polymer pore-surface and aqueous solution, between bound flavins and non-absorbed substrate molecules. Microenvironmental effects of crosslinked polymeric supports on the properties of a bound catalyst are far more difficult to study than in case 338 of soluble linear reactive polymers. In addition, estimation of intrinsic activ- ities of active sites may be almost impossible because of the uncertainties in the actual effective local concentrations, due to adsorption and absorption phenomena, and to non-homogeneous distribution of the active sites. How- ever, macroreticular beads that combine high surface area and porosity with reasonable high mechanical stability, may be very suitable for more practical application. To demonstrate this, we present an example of the excellent batch-wise reusability of the XAD-2 resin 1 in Fig. 6. 0 2 I. 6 8 10 number of cycles Fig. 6. Initial reaction rates of BNAH oxidation by polymer 1 as a function of the recycling ([ BNAH ]o ! : 2.8 X 10~4 M, see Experimental for other details). Conclusions Crosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers functionalized with a flavin model can be applied and reused as redox catalysts in water/2- propanol mixtures, but only sites situated at the polymer/solvent interface in the outer layer of the bead can play an active role due to diffusional problems for sites located at interfaces in the interior of the bead. Sorption of substrate by a polymeric resin does not automatically result in enhance- ment of reaction rates, because from highly aqueous solutions an apolar substrate may be absorbed rather than adsorbed by the apolar resin. As a result the substrate molecules may be more or less immobilized in the resin, not in the vicinity of an active site, which may then even result in a relative rate decrease.
