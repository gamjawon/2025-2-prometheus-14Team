The incorporation of a small amount of nickel carbonate or nickel nitrate doped with iron in the electrode mass has been found to be useful in bifunctional air-cathodes. Introduction Metal-air secondary batteries, accumulators, are a challenge to the electrochemist. The air cathode does not have to contain the oxidant needed during the discharge, therefore the air electrode can be made very thin and light. Replacing the heavy nickel electrode in alkaline batteries with an air cathode provides a large advantage in lightness and cost. The problem is the charging of the battery: air cathodes have mostly been intended only for cathodic operation, that is, monofunctional operation. A secondary battery needs a bifunctional air cathode (BAC). When an air electrode is used for oxygen evolution, it is exposed to a highly corrosive potential. The mixture used for the air electrode often comprises a low surface area carbon and a catalyst for oxygen reduction bonded with a hydrophobic polymer (TFE) [1,2]. The oxygen reduction catalysts are usually quite poor catalysts for the evolution of oxygen. We have been developing air cathodes, and in an effort to convert them into BACs we made a study of oxygen evolution catalysts. When using a typical manganese perovskite catalyst, the oxygen evolution takes place at +800 mV us. Hg/HgO at 20 mA cm\"2. At such high potentials, the conductive additive (acetylene black) is damaged in several hours. A goal was set there- fore - the oxygen evolution catalyst should be effective in low loadings <10 mg cm\"2 and depress the oxygen evolution potential to <+600 mV us. Hg/HgO at 50 mA cm\"2. The literature has suggested many different compounds as oxygen evolution catalysts, as well as many ways of applying these catalysts in an 0304-5012/86/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 42 electrode. There are two main methods of catalyst application; firstly to coat the screen, and secondly to bind a powdered catalyst. The coating can be done by either thermal decomposition [3], electroplating [4] or thermal spraying [5]. The compounds used as catalysts include both hydrous oxides/ hydroxides [6], refractory oxides [7] and disperse metals [8]. Experimental Scope of investigation We attempted two ways of application using different compounds: one way was to coat the screen in the electrode and the other was to mix the catalyst with binder and press it onto the screen. During our study a third application method was suggested and tried: impregnation of the complete electrode. After these initial experiments we decided that co-mixing of the oxygen evolution catalyst powder with the electrode mix was the most promising means of application. It was also decided that nickel hydroxide was the most interesting catalyst for further studies. Experiments involving impregnation of carbon paper pieces were part of these studies. Screens coated with thermally decomposed nitrates The coating of nickel screens with spinels was done by dipping the screens into approximately molar solutions of the appropriate nitrates, drying in a stream of hot air and finally decomposing the nitrates at 300 C. Screens coated with thermally sprayed metal The flame spraying of the screens with Ni/Al was done according to a patent [5]. Screens coated with electrodeposited alloy The electrodeposition of NiZn alloy was done from a bath l M in N1S04 and 0.5 M in ZnSU4 and with 0.5 M HaBOs, at a current density of 8 - 16 mA cm\"2 and at 40 C. Bonded catalyst powders Nickel ferrites were prepared both by hydroxide precipitation and decomposition of nitrates, LaNi03 with hydroxide precipitation and Lao.6 Cao^CoOa with the acetate method. NiZn3 alloy was made by dissolution of nickel into molten zinc at 800 C in an inert atmosphere. The alloy was brittle and easy to pulverize. It was leached by hot 45% KOH overnight, washed until neutral and finally dried at 80 C. The catalysts were mixed with 15% of acetylene black and some Teflon dispersion, and pressed onto nickel screens. 43 Catalysation by impregnation of a complete electrode An ordinary perovskite air cathode comprising Cao^L&o iMnOy with 10% acetylene black bonded with Teflon -FEP was removed from the electrolyte beaker after some hours of operation. The half cell including electrode was dipped into a solution of 0.5 Molar F1 of nickel nitrate for 2 min. Thereafter it was rinsed with pure water and returned to the electrolyte beaker. Nickel hydroxide experiments Experiments with nickel hydroxide were performed using stackpole carbon paper as a substrate. Small pieces of carbon paper were impregnated with a 1 - 2 M solution of the nickel nitrate and the nitrate of the dopant. Vacuum was used to make the solution penetrate the carbon paper. The im- pregnated papers were dried in air at 25 C and then at 100 C. Thereafter they were exposed to various treatments, including precipitation with carbonate and hydroxide. Results and discussion Coated screens By decomposition of nitrates The coating of screens with different cobalt spinels CozNK^, Co3Li^04 by thermal decomposition proved to be quite ineffective. They usually resulted in higher overvoltages than when used as an additive (compare curves A and B in Fig. 1). When Co2.sLio.204 powder was used as an additive, better performance was achieved. The application of the coating is time-consuming because it must be done three to four times. The activities of the coated screens are close to those reported by Jasen and Tseung [9] and Haenen et al. [3]. 10 20 Fig. l.

This system was used since it was suggested as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution [5], and electro- plated NiZn coatings exposed to Raney-treatment have been long known as good electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution [4] and recently also for oxygen evolution [7]. When tested, the NiAl system performed well in hydrogen evolution but in oxygen evolution potentials increased to over +700 mV us. Hg/HgO. By electroplating The electrocatalytic properties of the Ni/Zn coatings were good but their adherence was very poor, especially when the loading was > 5 mg/cm\"2. Bonded powders Disperse metals The sole material tested in this group was the Raney-NiZn made from NiZn3 alloy. The electrochemical performance was good; this material, however, is more expensive to manufacture than some of the hydrous oxides. Refractory oxides In this group perovskites Lao.gSro^CoOa, LaNiC>3 and spinels Co^NK^, Co2_gLio.204 and Nin.^Fe2_^04 were evaluated. As the nickel ferrites proved to be the most active, experiments to further enhance their activity were performed, which indicated that it is not possible to make single-phase Nii+^Fez-xO^ at pressures below 2 MPa of oxygen when x > 0. Although they are not stated to have single-phase compositions, the compounds Nii^F !^^ and Nii egFi 3304 have been reported by Orchotsky et al. [7], The nickel ferrite preparations used in this study were made at temperatures in the range 300 - 500 C and exhibited approximately the same performance. Impregnation of a complete electrode Impregnation with nickel nitrate proved to be effective in lowering overvoltage without sacrificing cathodic performance, as can be seen from Fig. 2, where the results are also compared to those of an untreated electrode. The untreated electrode has a high potential for oxygen evolution; after oxygen evolution overnight the cathodic operation was severely impaired while the treated electrode still performed well. Experiments on the use of nickel hydroxide Two interesting questions existed concerning the application of nickel hydroxide to the electrode mass: Could it be doped to further enhance activity? How was it going to survive the baking of the gas-diffusion electrode. Nickel hydroxide starts to decompose at 250 C and is transformed into nickel oxide, which is considerably less active. We tried some other 45 i:+15 10>i -100 UysHgHgO (mV) r500 time 500 i:-100 Fig. 2. Potential of air electrode during cycling experiments.

Doping of nickel hydroxide The results of the doping experiments are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Strong effects are exhibited by iron and titanium. Iron has long been known to cause problems during the charging of nickel electrodes. Some- times called 'iron poisoning', this effect is caused by lowering of the oxygen overvoltage. Titanium has not been investigated before as an additive. The common factor for titanium and iron compared to the other elements in this investigation is that both of them can readily assume oxidation states higher than three. This could improve the conductivity of the nickel oxyhydroxide by introducing a small fraction of two-valent nickel into the three-valent lattice. The special experimental technique used here might, however, have put too much emphasis on the conductivity of the nickel hydroxide. The carbon fibre paper is very thin, and much of the Fig. 3.

This can be understood if one compares the treated electrode in Fig. 2 which used a pure nickel compound with the undoped sample of Fig. 3. Several Ni/Fe combinations were investigated (see lower part of Table 1). Although it has a low overvoltage, the preparation with 70% iron was not useful because hexavalent ferrate, which is a harmful oxidant, was formed. For the baking experiments we chose to work with a 30% iron preparation. Influence of heat treatment on different hydroxide precursors The results of these heat treatment experiments are found in Table 2. At all levels of heat treatment the activity was impaired for all nickel compounds used. The activity is quite acceptable for the nitrate even after heat treatment at 300 C. The carbonate can be used at 260 C, and is to be preferred over nitrate because nitrate can act as a redox shuttle for the current in a battery. Comparison with other investigations Comparison of our results with other types of bifunctional air cathodes, cf. Table 3, shows that the catalysts of these systems are dominated by nickel rather than iron or titanium. Thus DREO, SUAB and Siemens use porous sintered nickel as framework in their electrodes, and hence automatically obtain a nickel surface area sufficiently high to lower the oxygen over- potential. Westinghouse uses a quite complex 'additive package' comprising NiS, FeW04 and Co/WC. According to Yeager [12], the active components 47 TABLE 2 Influence on activity of different methods of application of Ni/Fe to stackpole carbon paper Compound Heat treatment ( C) Potential at 26 mA cm 2 (mV Hg HgO) acetate carbonate nitrate hydroxide 330 260 330 260 330 260 260 +770 +745 +670 +595 +620 +590 +610 +570 Voi 30 min in air.
