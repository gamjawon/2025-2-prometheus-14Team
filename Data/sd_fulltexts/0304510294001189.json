Introduction The synthesis of methylamines from methanol and ammonia over acid catalysts is an important industrial process This reaction may also be a useful probe of catalyst acidity For example, in contrast to reactions such as hydrocarbon cracking, the products of methylamine synthesis are limited to three substituted methylammes, water, and dimethyl ether Furthermore, the small number of reactants and products allows for detailed studies of adsorption processes [ 1 ] Methylamine * Corresponding author ' Current address 3M Corporation, St Paul, MN 55144, USA 0304-5102/94/$07 00 1994 Elsevier Science B V All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00118-F 338 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalyses 93 (1994) 337-355 synthesis also proceeds without catalyst deactivation over a variety of solid acid catalysts Most of the literature on methylamme synthesis relates to the goal of achieving high selectivity towards the lower-substituted amines, dimethylamme (DMA) m particular Mochida, et al studied a variety of metal oxide and zeolite catalysts and found that Lewis acid sites alone are not active for the reaction [ 2] They suggested that the highest selectivity to DMA was achieved over acid sites of medium strength In contrast, Weigert found that Bronsted acid sites associated with H-mordemte were not selective for the lower substituted amines and that Na-mordenite was more selective, though less active [3] Shannon, et al [4] proposed that a combination of strong and weak sites is necessary for high activity and selectivity, with weaker sites allowing for weaker adsorption of the methylammes and more facile methanol adsorption. These researchers suggested that Lewis acid sites may be associated with low DMA selectivity, and they performed studies directed towards the formulation of shape-selective catalysts for production of DMA [5-10] Small-pore catalysts such as ZK-5 [ 6 ] , rho [ 5 ] , and enomte and ehabazite [ 8 ] were found to have low selectivity towards tnmethylamme ( < 20%) , while the rho and ZK-5 exhibited high DMA selectivity ( > 50%) Similar work was conducted by Herrmann [ 11 ] and Segawa and Tachibana [ 12] The latter workers formulated a dealummated H-mordenite catalyst with high DMA selectivity The primary focus of the aforementioned literature has been the development of highly selective catalysts, and the corresponding kinetic data were collected at high conversions The present study was undertaken to probe the surface chemistry by collecting kinetic data at low conversions, m the form of turnover frequencies, activation energies, and kinetic reaction orders In addition, we report catalytic activities for the following related reactions methylamme disproporhonation reactions, reactions of methanol and dimethyl ether with ammes, and methanol dehydration Finally, we suggest catalytic cycles that are consistent with adsorption, spectroscopic, and kinetic data For our work we have chosen to study acidic silicon-aluminum oxides, which have proven to be effective catalysts for methylamme synthesis and which are used commercially It is important to note that we have specifically avoided the study of shape-selective, small-pore zeolites to insure that our kinetic data are not influenced by transport limitations In this respect, we have limited our studies to silica-alumna and the relatively large-pore zeolites Y, mordemte, and ZSM-5 2. Experimental A flow-through apparatus operating at 1 atm pressure was used for reaction kinetics measurements The reactor was made from a Cajon VCR bulkhead union with an inner diameter of 0 7 cm Gaseous reactants were fed to the reactor through mass-flow controllers (Hastings HFC) Typical flowrates were 580 cm3/mm for D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 337-355 339 Table 1 Catalyst acidic properties Sample Acrd site density (tcmol/g) NaH-Y-33 360 NaH-Y-65 1000 NaH-Y-82 1450 H-mordenrte 710 H-ZSM5-13 670 H-ZSM5-35 360 H-ZSM5-225 74 a silica-alumina 90 Bronsted/200 total e Value estimated from Sr/Al ratio of zeolite He and 7 cm3/min for NH3. Methanol was fed to the system with a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Model 11), typically at 0 4 cm3/h For methylamme synthesis reaction studies, methanol inlet pressures were typically held between 1 5 and 3 Torr, while ammonia feed pressures were typically in the range of 4 to 6 Torr Feed pressures were vaned as necessary to measure reaction orders or to conduct kinetic studies of related reactions (i e , methanol dehydration, methylamine disproportionation reactions, and reactions of methanol and dimethyl ether with methylamines) For these latter studies, methylamines were fed to the system through a Nupro needle valve The entire system was made of stainless steel and heated to 423 K Analyses of the feed and reactor effluent streams were performed using a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890A) with a packed column of 0 05 M/8% KOH washed Carbowax on Carbopack B Samples (20-75 mg) were first treated under vacuum for 1 h at 300, 473, 573, and 723 K, followed by calcination under flowing oxygen (100 cm3/mm) at 723 K The catalysts used in these kinetic studies are listed in Table 1 Three catalysts were prepared from NaH-Y zeolite (Linde), with 33, 65, and 82% of the Na exchange canons replaced by protons, and these catalysts are designated as NaHY-33, NaH-Y-65, and NaH-Y-82, respectively H-mordenite was obtained from Conteka Corporation. Two H-ZSM-5 catalysts were obtained from T Degnan of Mobil Corporation (Paulsboro) with Si/Al ratios of 13 and 225, and these samples are designated as H-ZSM5-13 and H-ZSM5-225, respectively Another H-ZSM-5 catalyst, designated as H-ZSM5-35, had a Si/Al ratio of 35 and was provided by W Haag of Mobil Corporation (Princeton). The amorphous silica-alumina catalyst was obtained from Davison Corporation and had an aluminum loading of 13 wt% The silica catalyst was a fumed silica obtained from Cabot Corporation (grade EH5) The acidities of the catalysts were assessed by infrared spectroscopic and microcalonmetnc measurements of pyndine adsorption The details of these measurements for the NaH-Y zeolites [ 13 ] , H-mordenite [ 13,14 ] , and silica-alumina [ 15 ] 340 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 337-355 Table 2 Average enthalpy changes of adsorption on H-ZSM5-35 and H-mordemte (all values are m kJ/mol) Base Proton H-ZSM5-35 H-mordemte affinity dHs~ 8 dH-k dHs~ g JHw_k NH3 857 7 -151 -69 - 158 -72 MMA 895 8 -204 -98 -219 -91 DMA 922 6 - 245 -142 - 207 -134 TMA 938 5 -155 - 71 -140 -66 CH30H 773 6 -91 -42 -87 -60 DME 8079 -79 -66 -99 -71 H20 723 8 -61 -75 have been described elsewhere We report in Table 1 the number of Bronsted acid sites and the total number of acid sites for those catalysts that also display Lewis acidity Further microcalonmetric measurements of the adsorption of ammonia, methylamines, methanol, dimethyl ether, and water on H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite catalysts [ 1 ] have been previously reported We summarize the latter data in Table 2 3.

Discussion 41 Factors affecting damethyl ether production The rate of DME formation is inversely proportional to ammonia partial pressure for all catalysts studied This behavior indicates that ammonia blocks surface species involved m DME formation Infrared spectroscopy reveals only methoxy (CH30) species on the surface under conditions of methanol dehydration [1], therefore, methoxy species are the probable surface intermediates involved m methanol dehydration to DME, and these species are blocked by adsorbed ammonia or amines The rate of DME formation from methanol m the absence of ammonia is first order m methanol for all catalysts at 603 K Because the acid sites m the H-ZSM5 catalysts are widely separated, reactions between methoxy species on different acid sites are not probable Thus, methanol dehydration involves reaction of a methoxy species with another form of methanol that is not associated specifically with an acid site, e g , physisorbed methanol Earlier calorimetric studies have suggested the presence of two sites, one strong and acidic, the other being a weaker adsorption site [ I ] The first-order dependence of the rate of methanol dehydration on the methanol pressures can be explained if the acid sites are saturated with methoxy species (i e , the surface concentration is independent of the methanol pressure) while the concentration of physisorbed methanol is linearly dependent on the methanol pressure In situ IR studies indicate that the surface coverage by methoxy species is high under reaction conditions for methanol dehydration The rate of methanol dehydration to form DME m the presence of ammonia is also first order m methanol Infrared spectroscopic studies show that the surface coverage by methoxy species is low under methylamme synthesis reaction conditions We speculate that the surface coverage by methoxy species under these conditions is primarily controlled by the pressure of ammonia or methylammes, and thus the fraction of sites populated by methoxy species is a weak function of methanol pressure The rate of methanol conversion to dimethyl ether is significantly slower m the presence of ammonia or other amines Accordingly, this reaction pathway is suppressed under methylamme synthesis reaction conditions This behavior is further evidence that methanol dehydration takes place through an intermediate (e g , a methoxy species) that is blocked by adsorbed ammonia and methylammes 4 2 Effect of reactant pressures on reaction kinetics Prior to describing the factors controlling the observed reaction kinetics, it is important to examine the possibility of mass-transport limitations The extent of mtraparticle limitations can be assessed by the dimensionless Damkohler number for diffusive transport, RrP/CSDe, where R is the rate of reaction per unit volume, D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 337-355 349 rp is the radius of the particle, CS is the reactant concentration at the surface of the particle, and De is the effective diffusivity [ 16] Mass-transport limitations are negligible when the value of the Damkohler number is less than unity Under methylammes synthesis conditions, the value of this dimensionless group is approximately 0 06, suggesting that the reaction kinetics observed m this study are controlled primarily by the surface chemistry Kinetic studies of methylamme synthesis show that the methylamme formation rate is first order with respect to ammonia pressure for reaction temperatures from 603 to 723 K This result indicates that the surface coverage by ammonia is low under methylamme synthesis conditions This behavior is consistent with the results of m situ IR studies that show the surface to be predominantly covered with methylammes under methylamme synthesis conditions The origin for this behavior is that methylammes adsorb more strongly than ammonia [ 1 ] (see Table 2) For example, the pressure of methylammes at the reactor outlet is typically on the order of 0 2 Torr, about 500 times lower than that of ammonia at the highest pressures studied However, the heat of adsorption of MMA is approximately 55 kJ/mol higher than that of ammonia, and the surface coverage of ammonia is expected to be 1 % of the surface coverage of MMA at 623 K A result of this study is the understanding that the dependence of the methylamme synthesis rate on methanol pressure is rather complex H-ZSM-5 and NaH-Y-65 catalysts show negative orders with respect to methanol, while H-mordemte and silica-alumna show zero and positive methanol orders This kinetic behavior is surprising because methanol adsorption is relatively weak compared to the adsorption of ammonia and methylammes [ 1 ] (see Table 2), and the surface coverage of adsorbed methanol on the acid sites is expected to be low compared to the strongly basic methylammes The observed kinetic behavior can be explained m the following manner When methanol reacts with adsorbed ammonia to form methylammes, a first-order dependence on methanol pressure would be expected if the acid sites are covered primarily by ammonia, this behavior is observed for several catalysts at low methanol pressures As the methanol pressure is increased and the rate of formation of methylammes increases, the reaction products displace ammonia from the active sites (because methylamines adsorb more strongly than ammonia) The rate of methylamme synthesis decreases and approaches zero order m methanol The origin for the negative reaction orders with respect to methanol is not clear at present We suggest that this behavior may be related to the inhibition by weakly adsorbed methanol of methylamme desorption from the acid sites, as discussed later in this paper 4 3 Formulation of catalytic cycles The results of microcalonmetnc adsorption studies provide important information about the energetic stabilities of different molecules on the surface [ 1 ] It can 350 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 337-355 be seen m Table 2 that the heats of adsorption of the amines on acid sites increase m the order NH3 < MMA < DMA, m accord with the proton affinities of these molecules The heat of adsorption of TMA on acid sites is similar to that of NH3, despite the fact that TMA has the highest gas-phase proton affinity; this behavior may be due to stenc factors Methanol adsorbs on acid sites with a heat of adsorption lower than that of any of the amines Thus, as noted above, ammonia and methylamme coverages should be much higher than that of methanol The microcalonmetnc studies also show that all catalysts possess sites on which the reactants and products of methylamme synthesis weakly adsorb with strengths ranging from about 50-140 kJ/mol These sites may be associated with hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions within the catalyst micropores A critical aspect m the formulation of catalytic cycles for methylamme synthesis reactions involves the possible role of surface methoxy species As noted above, we suggest that methoxy species are reactive intermediates m the dehydration of methanol to DME It is less clear whether these species are involved m the synthesis of methylammes from methanol and ammonia We now present a general sequence of steps that describes the essential aspects of methylamme synthesis and related catalytic processes The first steps m the sequence are adsorption and desorption of all reactants and products onto the weak, non-acidic sites of the catalyst, represented by # These steps are followed by migration of weakly adsorbed species to acid sites, represented as Bronsted acid sites, H', where ` represents the zeohric lattice oxygen The dehydration of methanol to DME can be represented by the following two reaction steps involving methoxy species (CH3 ). CH3 OH# + H \" -- CH3 + H2 0# (1) CH3 OH# + CH; - H ` + DME# ( 2 ) The catalytic cycle for methanol dehydration thus consists of Steps 1 and 2. This reaction can exhibit first-order kinetics with respect to methanol pressure if the surface is saturated with methoxy species Also, this reaction will be suppressed m the presence of ammonia or amines, because these bases interact more strongly with acid sites than do methoxy species Under methylamme synthesis reaction conditions, the surface will be saturated with DMA and MMA, and only a small fraction of the acid sites will contain ammonia and methanol molecules Accordingly, the probability of having adjacent adsorbed methanol and ammonia molecules is low, and, the rate of methylamme synthesis via reaction between these adsorbed species would be negligible Therefore, we suggest that methylamme synthesis takes place by reaction of a strongly adsorbed species on an acid site with a second species that is weakly adsorbed on the catalyst Methylamine synthesis and disproportionation reactions can be written with or without participation of methoxy species Consider, for example, the following steps D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 337-355 351 NH3#+CH3 _-HMMA\" +# (3a) MMA# + CH3 ;zL-- HDMA' + # (3b ) DMA#+CH3 i=:~! HTMA'+# (3c) A serious difficulty with these steps for MMA disproportionation is that they cannot predict the observed effect of adding methanol to MMA over the acid sites, i e , the suppression of ammonia formation In particular, the NH3 produced in the reverse of Step 3a cannot readsorb on acid sites because these sites are covered by strongly adsorbed MMA species Accordingly, adding methanol would not suppress the formation of ammonia during MMA disproportionation, instead, methanol would react with methoxy species in Step 2 to form DME In contrast to this predicted behavior, the experimental data show that DME is not produced when methanol and MMA are passed over H-ZSM-5, and the primary effect of methanol is to suppress ammonia formation from MMA We suggest that the following types of steps are involved in methylamine synthesis and amine disproportionation reactions MMA# + HMMA ' = NH3 # + HDMA (4a ) MMA# + HMMA ' -- NH; + DMA# (4b ) DMA# + HDMA ` R=:~ MMA# + HTMA ` (5a) DMA# + HDMA '\" -- HMMA ` + TMA# (5b ) NH3 # + HTMA \" -- MMA# + HDMA ` (6a ) NH3 # + HTMA ` _- HMMA ' + DMA# (6b ) TMA#+NH4 --MMA#+HDMA' (7a) TMA# + NH4 -- HMMA ` + DMA# (7b ) The advantages of these steps for explaining the experimental data are that two acid sites need not be in close proximity for chemical reaction, and more weakly adsorbed species such as NHQ are placed directly on acid sites The physical basis for steps such as 4a and 4b is that the quaternary amine species associated with the acid sites may rotate on the surface such that disproportionation of these species with weakly adsorbed species may lead to either of the reaction products becoming associated with the acid site The reaction scheme represented by Steps 4-7 is also consistent with the experimental result that the rates of MMA and DMA disproportionation are an order of magnitude higher than the rates of methylamine synthesis from methanol and ammonia In particular, the pressures of MMA and DMA under the methylamine synthesis conditions of this study are at least an order of magnitude lower than the pressures of MMA and DMA employed for studies of disproportionation reactions The surface coverages by weakly adsorbed MMA and 352 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 337-355 DMA are directly proportional to pressure, and the reaction scheme represented by Steps 4-7 gives the proper dependence of the disproportionation rate on pressure The reaction steps leading to methylamme synthesis and to the effects of adding methanol to MMA and DMA may be written as follows CH3 OH# + NH4 ~HMMA * +HZ O# (8 ) CH3 OH# + HMMA * -- HDMA * + HZ O# (9 ) CH3 OH# + HDMA * -- HTMA * + HZ O# (10 ) Finally, reaction steps must be included that allow for the reaction of dimethyl ether with ammonia and the amines We suggest the following analogous steps DME# + NH4 ;z~ HMMA * + CH3 OH# (11) DME# + HMMA * HDMA * + CH3 OH# (12 ) DME# + HDMA * HTMA * + CH3 OH# (13 ) The above reaction steps form catalytic cycles for the reactions of methanol, DME, and amines, and these cycles are depicted graphically m Fig 12 Major points that must be satisfied by this scheme are that methylamme synthesis involves the formation and participation of strongly adsorbed species, and the rate of methylamme synthesis is a rather complex function of the methanol pressure Furthermore, these kinetics must be achieved despite the fact that the surface coverage of the acid sites by methanol species must be low to be consistent with the microcalonmetnc and IR spectroscopic results In the absence of weak sites, methylammes must desorb directly from the acid sites to the gas phase Because the heats of adsorption of MMA and DMA are at least 200 kJ/mol, the maximum rates of desorption are equal to 10-4 s-' at 623 K, assuming a normal value of the desorption preexponential factor equal to 10'3 s-' This maximum rate is several orders of magnitude lower than the observed rate of methylamme disproporhonarion Furthermore, the activation energies of methylamme synthesis and related reactions are significantly lower than the heats of MMA or DMA adsorption on the acid sites. However, the desorption of strongly adsorbed MMA and DMA onto weaker sites is much faster (e g , 104 s -') , and high turnover frequencies for MMA and DMA disproportionation can be achieved Accordingly, we suggest that acid sites combined with weak adsorption sites are critical for methylamme synthesis and related reactions, i.e , acid sites are required for the critical reaction steps and weak sites facilitate desorption of strongly adsorbed ammes from the acid sites The complex reaction kinetics of methylamme synthesis with respect to the methanol pressure can be explained by the proposed catalytic cycle m terms of the surface coverages by CH30H# and CH3 As noted above, vacant weak sites, #, are required to facilitate desorption of strongly adsorbed amme species Because the range of heats of adsorption for species on the weak sites is much narrower (ca 90 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 337-355 TMA# MMA# NH4* TMA# DMA# DME# MeOH# DMA# MMA# MeOH# H20# 1 t IMMA* ~IA# DME# MeOH# DMA# NHg# MeOH# Hp0# I HDMA* I l DMA# MMA# DME# MeOH# MMA# NH3# MeOH# H20# l t HTMA*' H* i DME# MeOH# 1 MeOH# H20# i DMA# CH3* NH3# 353 Fig 12 Catalytic cycles for methylanune synthesis and related reactions Each box represents a reactive surface mtennediate vertical lines represent reaction paths, and intersecting horizontal bars separate reactants and products Arrows and shading refer to reaction rates under typical methylamtne synthesis reaction conditions dark, solid tines refer to primary production pathways, tight, solid lines refer to a secondary pathways, and light, dashed tines refer to minor pathways under reaction conditions Arrows associated with horizontal bars indicate reverstbilrties of the steps kJ/mol) than the range for heats of adsorption on the acrd sites (ca 170 kJ/mol), the surface coverage of these weak sites by CH30H$$ species can become significant at high methanol pressures [ 1 ] Accordingly, these species can suppress amore desorption A direct effect of methanol on methylamme synthesis kinetics is the formation of methoxy species m the presence of methanol For example, DME formation under methylamme synthesis reaction conditions is not inhibited by methanol, and this observed behavior is consistent with the suggestion that methoxy species are reactive intermediates for this reaction However, while these species are involved m DME formation from methanol, surface methoxy species are not apparently involved m methylamme synthesis or disproportionarion steps Therefore, higher surface coverages by methoxy species lead to lower coverages by reactive amore species on the acid sites and to lower rates of methylamme synthesis 354 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 337-355 5. Conclusions Microcalonmetric and infrared spectroscopic studies, reported elsewhere, have been used in conjunction with the present kinetic studies to probe the catalytic cycles involved in methylamine synthesis and related reactions over acid catalysts The results of these studies have suggested the importance of both strong and weak adsorption sites in methylamine synthesis and related reactions The reaction orders with respect to ammonia pressure suggest that one of the reactive species is strongly adsorbed, 1 e , adsorbed nitrogenous bases for the production of methylamines, or methoxy groups for the production of dimethyl ether The reaction orders with respect to methanol pressure demonstrate more complicated behavior, suggesting that other reactive species may be weakly adsorbed Amme species can react with both methanol and dimethyl ether, although reactions with methanol are more favorable Disproportionation reactions are fast, suggesting that these may be important pathways for the production of the higher-substituted amines during methylamine synthesis The combination of microcalonmetnc measurements and kinetic studies suggests that acid sites are required in these reactions for the strong adsorption of ammonia and methylammes, and weak adsorption sites are required to facilitate desorption of adsorbed amine species from the acid sites Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the Department of Energy and through a Joint China-US Cooperative Research Grant administered by the National Science Foundation Two of us (DTC and JMK) would like to thank the National Science Foundation for graduate fellowships We also wish to thank Randy Cortnght at the University of Wisconsin for valuable insight during the latter stages of this project References [ 1 ] D T Chen, L Zhang, Y Chen and J A Dumesic, J Catal, 146 (1994) 257 [21 1 Mochuda, Y A , H Fujitsu and K Takeshita, J Catal, 82 (1983) 313 [31 F J Weigert, J Catal , 103 (1987) 20 [41 R D Shannon, M Keane Jr, L Abrams, R H Staley, T E Gter, D R Corbin and G C Sonnichsen, J Catal, 114 (1988) 8 [51 R D Shannon, M Keane Jr, L Abrams, R H Staley, T E Ger, D R Corbin and G C Sonnichsen, J Catal, 113 (1988) 367 [ 6 ] R D Shannon, M Keane Jr, L Abrams, R H Staley, T E Grer and G C Sonnichsen, J Catal , 115 (1989 ) 79 [7] L Abrams, M Keane it and G C Sonnichsen, J Catal , 115 (1989) 410 [ 8 ] M Keane Jr , G C Sonnichsen, L Abrams, D R Corbin, T E Gier and R D Shannon, App Catal , 32 (1987) 361 [9] D Corbin, M Keane Jr, L Abrams, R Farlee, P Brerstedt and T Bem, J Catal , 124 (1990) 268 D T Chen et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 337-355 355 [ 10] H E Bergna, M Keane Jr , D H Ralston, G C Sonmchsen, L Abrams and R D Shannon, J Catal , 115 (1989) 148 [ 11 ] C Herrmann and F Fettmg, App Catal , 39 (1988) 213 [ 12 ] K Segawa and H Tachabana, J Catal , 131 (1991) 482 [ 13 ] D T Chen, S B Sharma, I Filimonov and J A Dumesic, Catal Let t, 12 (1992) 201 [ 14] S B Sharma, B L Meyers, D T Chen, J Miller and J A Dumesic, Appl Catal A, 102 (1993) 253 [ 15 ] D Chen, S Sharma, N Cardona-Martinez, J A Dumesic, V A Bell, G D Hodge and R J Madon, J Catal, 136 (1992) 392 [ 16] P B Weisz and C D Prater, Adv Catal , 6 (1954) 143 X244 94001189 0304-5102(94)00118-9 10.1016/0304-5102(94)00118-9 Methylamine synthesis over solid acid catalysts: Reaction kinetic measurements D.T.

Kinetic studies were performed over silica-alumina and acidic zeolites to determine the effects of temperature (from 600 to 700 K) and reactant pressures ( < 80 Torr) on the rates of methylamine synthesis from methanol and ammonia. Related kinetic studies were conducted of methylamine disproportionation reactions, methanol dehydration, and reactions of methanol and dimethyl ether with methylamines. The results suggest that the reactive species for methylamine synthesis are adsorbed nitrogenous bases, while methoxy groups are reactive species for dimethyl ether production. Disproportionation reactions may be important pathways for the production of the higher-substituted amines during methylamine synthesis. The combination of microcalorimetric measurements, reported elsewhere, and kinetic studies suggests that acid sites are required in these reactions for the strong adsorption of ammonia and methylamines, and weak adsorption sites are required to facilitate desorption of adsorbed amine species from the acid sites.
