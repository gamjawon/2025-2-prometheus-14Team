Key words: catalysis; heteropolyanions; molecularity 1. Introduction Heteropoly compounds are suitable materials for the catalyst design, because (1) acidic and redog properties can be controlled by choosing the constituent elements of anions and countercations, (2) the compounds provide unique reaction fields such as pseudoliquid phase and have ability of complex formation to stabilize reaction intermediates, and (3) structures can be much better defined at the molecular level of polyanions than the conventional oxide catalysts. Therefore, molecular design of catalysts, molecular description of catalytic reactions including catalysts themselves, and cluster modeling of mixed oxide catalysts are possible by using heteropoly compounds. In this review, the recent progress in catalysis (both in solid and solution states) of heteropoly compounds will be described, placing stress on the molecularity and the unique reaction field [ 1 ] . Most research in general on the catalysis by heteropoly compounds are not included. They may be referred to the literature [ 2 ] . Here, the term \"heteropoly compound\" is used for heteropolyacid and its salt. *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Primary and secondary structure Polyanions consisting of one kind of osoanion are called isopolyanions, eqn. (1) . Heteropolyanions are polymeric osoanions which are formed by the condensation of more than two different ogoanions, eqn.

The primary structure in this case is the heteropolyanion with Keggin structure as shown in Fig. la [ 3 ] . Four edge-shared octahedra, W3013, are eked by shared corners to each and to the central P04 (W, polyor addenda atom; P, central or hetero-atom). As an example of the secondary structure, H3PW1204o-6H20 is shown in Fig. lc [4]. The heteropolyanions are packed in a bcc structure, in which the protonated water dimer, (H20) 2H 1, is (a) 3 PW12040 Fig. 1. Structure of 12-tungatophosphoric acid.

The primary structure (Keggin anion) is stable in general, but the secondary structure is often variable upon interaction with polar molecules such as water, ethanol, and dimethyl ether, metal ions, etc. [ 5-? ] . Table 1 lists the heteropolyanions having various compositions and structures [ lb ] . Among them, the Keggin anions are in general thermally more stable and easily prepared 2.2. Lacunary heteroOlyanion as a unique ligand Lacunary heteropolyanions which are formed at relatively high pH are widely used as ligands to 3d metal ions. For example, Figure 2a shows the vacancy created by the loss of MOs octahedron from a Keggin anion and TiCp attached to it [ 8 ] . The vacancy represents a binding site; for example, PW1103; acts as a pentadentate and tetradentate ligand with Co and Cu, respectively [ lb ] . Complexes of anions such as XW 11 Oss (X - P, Si ) with metal ions have been used as inorganic analogues of metalloporphyrins and have important advantages as catalysts, i.e., high resistance to oxidative degradation and thermal stability. 2.3. Discrete fragments of solid metal oxides - cluster models Heteropolyanions consist of an approximately close-packed array of oxide ions and thus can be regarded as a discrete fragment of extended oxide lattice. A prototypical example is the Keggin anion, PW120430 , shown in the space filling representation (Fig. lb) where the open circles are bridging ogygens (W-O-W) and the dark circles are terminal ogygens (-W-O) ). The space filling representations illustrate that heteropolyanions provide an opportunity to prepare discrete, atomically characterizable, oxide-supOrO transition (a) (b) Fig. 2.

Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 metal catalysts that can also reach atomic dispersion if desired. Recently, the metal atom supported upon the heteropolyanions such as [CpTi SiW9V3040 ] \"(Fig. 2b [9] ), [ (C5Me6)Rh SiW9Nb3040]6- [10], [ (COD)Ir-P2Wls1 `^'3062 ] a- [ 11 ] , and [ (Ph3P) 2IrH2 ] 3PW 120.,0 [ 12 ] structures have been reported by Finke et al. and Siedle et al. The heteropolyanion-supported metals mean the species that are firmly attached to a x 3-O site of heteropolyanion. This is analogous to the envisioned situation of some oxide-supported heterogeneous catalysts but different from organometallics bound by a single, labile bridging oxygen, such as Si-O-Rh (t1-C3Hg) (H) and M-O-Ni (rP-C3H5 ) (M=Si, Al) [9]. 3. Acid and redos properties 3- such as PW12040 , PM012040 , SiW120440T, and P2Wlg0162 have very low negative charge on the surface osygens of the poly anion (little basicity) and therefore, their acid forms (H3PW12040, etc.) are strong acids. They are also good multi-electron oxidants due to the presence of Mob+, W +, and V6+. 3.1. Acidic properties Keggin-type heteropolyacids are essentially completely dissociated in an aqueous solution. The dissociation is often stepwise in organic media. The acidity is higher than that of the osoacids of constituent elements and ordinary mineral acids. For example, the acidity of concentrated aqueous and nonaqueous solutions of H3PW 120,,0 is higher by about 0.3 or 1.5 units of the Hammett acidity function (H0) than HC104 and H2S04 [ 13,14 ] . The acid strength has been measured by various methods and the general trends of the acid strength are W6+ > Mo6+ > V6+ (for polyatom)14) and pb+ > Si4+, Ge 4+ (for heteroatom or the charge of polyanion) [ 15,16 ] . For example, the acid strength in acetone (the pKl values in parentheses) decreased in the following order, PW312 (1.6)>PVWii (1.8)>SiWi2 (2.0)zPMo12 (2.0)>SiMoi2 (2.1) [1g], where PWi2 , etc. denotes the acidic H3PW12040, etc. In the solid state, H3PW12040 has an acidity stronger than -8.2 in H0 [ 14,17 ] . Thermal desorption of pyridine showed that significant amounts (corresponding to the amount of protons of the whole bulk) remained in H3PW1204o at 573 K, while pyridinium ion on Si02-A1203 was completely removed at 573 K [5,7 ]. This demonstrates that H3PW12040 is a strong protonic acid and all protons (both on the surface and in the bulk) contribute to the acidity. The acidic properties of heteropoly compounds in the solid state are very sensitive to counter cations as well as constituent elements of polyanions. In the case of metal salts, five mechanisms are possible for the origins of the acidity: (1) protons in the acidic salts, (2) partial hydrolysis during the preparation process, (3) acidic dissociation of coordinated water, (4) Lewis acidity N. Mimno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 323 of metal ions, and (5) protons formed by the reduction of metal ions [ ld ] . For Na salts of H3PW1204o, both the acid strength and acid amount decrease as the Na content increases, showing that the acidic properties can be controlled by salt formation [ ld ] . In the case of Cs salts, unique behavior is observed: Cs2,5Ho.5PW1204o showed high surface acidity and catalytic activity (see 4.3). 3.2. Redox properties In solutions, the reduction potentials of heteropolyanions containing Mo and V are high as these ions are easily reduced. Oxidative ability decreases in general in the order: V- > Mo- > W-containing heteropolyanions [ 14 ] . The reduction potential (or oxidizing ability) decreased linearly with decreasing valency of the central atom or increasing negative charge of the heteropolyanions, PW;2 > GeWi2 > SiWi2 > FeWi2 > BWi2 > CoW62 > CuW12 [18,19]. Here PWi2 , for example, denotes H3PW12040. For polyanions with mixed polyatoms, the reduction potentials have been reported to be PMoloV2- >PMo11V4->PMoi2 , andPMogWe- >PMOi2 [lb,ld]. In the solid state, the redox properties of 12-heteropoly compounds depend on both the constituent elements of polyanions and countercations. The oxidizing ability has been estimated from the rate of reduction of heteropoly compounds by H2, CO, and organic compounds. However, the data sometimes appear inconsistent, due to the difference in the kind of reductant, inhomogeneity, non-stoichiometry, decomposition, etc. of the catalysts.

Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 tant reason for the apparent inconsistency is the ignorance of the presence of surface- and bulk-type reactions (see Section 4.2 ). Recently, Kulesza et al. reported the cyclic voltammetry of a single crystal of H4SiW12O4O 31H20 [20], using an appropriate reference electrode and a ceramic tip capable of forming an ion-permeable, but still basically dry, junction with the solid sample (Fig. 3a). In the potential range of -0.1 to -0.65 V, three reversible redox transitions were observed in the ratios of number of electrons 1:1: 2, very similar to that in solutions as shown in Fig. 3b [21 ]. The reduction seems to correspond to the following equation. SiW120 +ze-+zH+->HZS^20~ (z=1,2,4) (3) It is expected that by using the method, the reduction potential of solid heteropoly compounds can be measured and that the effect of the constituent elements is made clearer. 4. Catalytic properties There are many patents and other literature describing the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis of heteropolyanions of traditional types. Such reactivity can be traced, ultimately, to either their strong acid or oxidizing properties and sometimes to the unique basicity of polyanions. Typical examples of acid and oxidation catalysis of heteropoly compounds in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems are listed in Tables 2 and 3. There are at least six industrial catalytic processes which utilize heteropoly compounds, i.e., hydrations of propene [22], n-butene [23], and isobutene [ 24 ] , glucoside synthesis [ 25 ] , polymerization of THF [ 26 ] , and oxidation of methacrolein [ 27 ] . It must be noted that heteropoly compounds are also useful catalysts for the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol, alcoholysis of epoxides, conversion of methanol, oxygenation of alkenes or alkanes and oxidative cleavage of vic-diols using hydrogen peroxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide, etc., although these are not included in Tables 2 and 3. The interesting and catalytically important features of heteropolyanions or solid heteropoly compounds are described in the following section. 4.1. Complexes of heteropolyanions with metal salts, phase-transfer reagents, or organometallics The combination or the complex of heteropolyanions with metal salts, phase transfer reagents, or organometallics has been reported to be effective for the enhancement of the catalytic activities. The examples are shown in Table 4. N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 TABLE 2 Acid-catalyzed reactions by (unsupported) heteropoly compounds Reaction Catalyst Temp./K Ref.

Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 4.1.1. Combination catalysts of heteropolyanions and palladium or rhodium salts Heteropolyanion is used as a reogidizing reagent of Pd in Wacker-type reactions. The advantage is the decrease in the Cl-, which causes the corrosion. The idea was first reported by Matveev et al. [ 28 ] . Izumi et al. found that PMogW60'- is the most effective heteropolyanion and that the slow step is the reoxidation of Pd to Pd\" in the oxidation of 1-butene [29]. Very recently, Catalytica have developed new technology for the Wackertype reactions [ 30 ] . Typical condition for ethylene oxidation is aqueous ca. 0.1 mM Pd\", ca. 5-25 mM Cl-, and ca. 0.30 M acidic salt of phosphomolybdovanadic acid, NayH13+x-y)PMo(12-x)VxO4O (preferably x=2-3). The Pd+ and chloride concentrations are 1/100th of those of the Wacker system. The solutions with pH 0-1 result in the high reaction rates and Pd\" stability as shown in Fig. 4. Pd2+ stability is also improved by the presence of centimolar chloride ion. In Catalytica's system, the phosphomolybdate matrix (Vb+/V4+) serves two purposes for Pd reosidation: (1) it solubilizes high concentrations of V6+ in aqueous solution. Phosphomolybdovanadate polyosoanions can support decimolar to molar concentrations of V6+ in solution; (2) it provides very rapid oxidation of V4+ by diogygen. The simple hydrolytic V4+ species at this acidity, V02+, is oxidized by diogygen relatively slowly. In contrast, V4+ in the phosphomolybdovanadate solutions can be oxidized as fast as diogygen can diffuse into the solution. Kinetic results, first and zero orders in Pd2+ or ethylene and V5+ concentrations, respectively, show that the oxidation of ethylene by water to produce acetaldehyde is rate determining.

Iet al. found that Keggin-type heteropolyanions containing Mo or V show a promoting effect in the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene by PdCl2 to form methyl N-phenylcarbamate in the presence of methanol [ 31 ] . Figure 5 shows the catalytic activities of H3+xPMo12_xVxO,,O-modified PdC12 and the maximum reduction potential of the heteropolyacids. The highest activity was obtained for H4PMo11V040; its maximum reduction potential was the highest. The correlation between the catalytic activity and the reduction potential of heteropolyacid suggests that the more reducible heteropolyacid forces more effective modification on Pd. It is proposed that the enhancement of the activity is due to the coordination of Pd2+ on partially reduced heteropolyanion as a basic macroligand. The e$amples for solid state are the hydrogen-enhanced acid catalysis observed for silver tungstophoaphatea as well as the mixture of heteropoly compounds and Pd or Pt catalysts [ 1g ] . 4.1.2. CoOiOion of heternpolyanions with phase-transfer reagents The phase-transfer liquid-phase oxidation catalysis by using Keggin-type heteropolyanions with quaternary countercationa such as methyltrioctylammonium ion has been reported by Venturello et al. [ 33 ] and Ishii et al. [ 34 ] . The ogidationa of alcohols [35], allyl alcohols [34], alkenea [33,36], alkynea [ 37 ] , ss-unsaturated acids [ 38 ] , vic-diols [ 39 ] , phenol [ 40 J , and amines [ 41 ] with hydrogen peroxide are the examples. This is in part due to the unique basicity of heteropolyanions. Perogopolyanion formed by the reaction with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous phase becomes slightly soluble in the organic phase, in which the oxidation of the substrate proOda. In the case of epogidation of alkenes, since water is 330 N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 absent in the organic phase, hydration of epoxide in the organic phase to produce diol is suppressed, resulting in high selectivity to epoxide. Recently, it was claimed that in some of these systems the peroxo species are not Keggin-type heteropolyanions but P04[WO(02)2]4- or [W203(02)4(H20)2]2- perORo compounds formed in aqueous phase [ 33,42,43 ] . 4.1.3. Lacunary heteropolyanions as oxidation-resistant ligands Irreversible oxidative degradation of the organic ligands of transition metal catalysts either by oxygen donors or by dioxygen itself results in the loss of catalytic activity. In a great majority of the homogeneous oxidations of hydrocarbons by oxometal-based catalysts including the metalloporphyrin systems, there is appreciable decomposition of the catalyst ligands and loss in activity after a few turnovers. Similar degradation of the organic ligands, often hydrophobic long-chain carboxylates, of the transition metals was observed in a largescale industrial hydrocarbon autoxidation process. These disadvantages of the organic ligands were greatly reduced by using the heteropolyanion as an oxidation-resistant inorganic ligand. Hill et al. applied the transition metal-substituted polyoxometalate (TMSP) complexes to the epoxidation of alkenes and the oxygenation of alkanes [44-46 ] . The rates, selectivities, and stabilities of TMSP in alkene epoxidation are compared with those of metalloporphyrins, Schiff base complexes, and triflate salts as follows: Reactivity. PW11Co(II)039 >PW11Mn(II)039 >Fe(III) (TDCPP)Cl >Fe(III) (TPP)Cl> M(OTf)2. Selectivity toepoxO.PW11Co(II)039 ;:zPW11Mri(II)039 > M(OTf)2> Fe (III) (TDCPP)Cl>Fe(III) (TPP)Cl. Stability. M(OTf)2<Fe(III) (TPP)Cl<Fe(III) (TDCPP)Cl < TMSP (TDCPP = tetrakis-2,6-dichlorophenylporphyrin; TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin; OTf = tritlate ion). TMSP is also active for alkane hydroxylation. Figure 6 summarizes the turnovers of a variety of oxo transfer catalysts for the reaction before catalyst destruction [46 ]. When t-butyl hydroperoxide is used as an oxygen donor, the turnover of TMSP is higher than those of metalloporphyrins, Schiff base complexes, triflate or nitrate salts, or other soluble transition metal complexes. Thus, lacunary heteropolyanion is a useful ligand in the oxygenation as well as other difficult oxidation process. Recently, Mansuy et al. also reported that P2W17Os1(Mn3+-Br)a- was oxidation-resistant and the most active for the epoxidation of cyclooctene with PhIO among the catalysts P2W17061(Mn+.Br)c11-n)- (Mn3+, Fe3+, Cot+' Nit+, Cue+) [47]. P2W17061 (Mn3+-Br)a- also catalyzes the oxygenation of cyclohexane, adamantane, and heptane, the hydroxylation of naphthalene, etc. It is noteworthy that the regioselectivity of limonene epoxidation and of adamantane and heptane oxidations on P2W17061(Mn3+-Br)8- are similar to those on Mn-porphyrin Mn (TDCPP) Cl.

Stability of transition-metal-substituted Olyogometalate (TMSP ) for oao transfer to hydrocarbons. The numbers given are for alkane ogygenations. For ruthenium as the catalytic transition metal center, the oaidations of cyclohegane, adamantane, and styrene have been performed with iodosylbenzene or t-butyl hydroperogide [ 48 J . 4.1.4. Heteropolyanion-supported metals The synthesis of the complexes, not the combination, of heteropolyanion with organometallic compounds and the catalysis of them have also been reported: Siedle et al. have shown that [L2Rh(CO) (CH3CN) J4[SiW12040J, 16 electron rhodium in [ L3Rh ( CO ) J 4 [ SiW 120,,E j , and [ L3Rh ( CO ) ] [ HC ( S03CF3 ) 2 ] -, catalyze hydroformylationa as solids suspended in toluene ( L = PPh3 ) [ 49 j . EXAFS data show that the Rh atom does not bind to the polyosoanion because the classical heteropolyanions such as SiW120~ or P2W180s2 have low surface charge denaity or basicity (in fact, they are like C104 ). This is readily understood by rewriting the polyogoanions PW1204o a$ (P04)a (W120ss)o and P2Wlg0g2 a8 (P04 )2 (W18054)0 SUCK C1a661Ca1 polyoaoanions can not be a support even for cations such as (CSMeS)Rh2+ or CpTi3+. Therefore, the organometallic cations should be supported on reduced heteropolyaniona or more negative polyoaoanions such as SiW9M30~ and PzW15MaOsz (M=V5+, NbS+). The latter have three full unite of anionic 332 N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 surface charge density that enable tight and covalent bonding of transition metals. Polyoxoanion-supported organometallics offer new opportunities to explore the catalytic properties and mechanisms of oxide-supported, atomically dispersed transition metals, because the composition and the structure of the active site can be fully established at the atomic level and such information is central to the rational design of the catalysts. Finke et al. synthesized P2W15Nb3062 having three full units of anionic surface charge density [50] and demonstrated that P2W,5Nb3062 -supported Ir catalyst, [ (n-C4H9) 4N ] 5Na3 [ (1,5-COD) Ir- P2W15Nb3O621 [ 11 ] , is active for both the hydrogenation [51] and the oxygenation [52] of cyclohexene. For example, the catalytic oxygenations of cyclohexene in the presence of various catalysts and 02 are shown in Table 5. The activity of the [ (nCA)4N]RX1514b3062-supported Ir, Rh, and Ru compounds decreased in the order of [ (n-C4H9) 4N ] 5Na3 [ (1,5-COD) Ir - P2W 15Nb3O62 ] > [ (nC4H9)4N]4.5Na2.5[ (C6H6)Ru*P2W15Nb 3062] ~:\" [ (n-C4H9)4N]5Na3 [ (1,a-)4N ] 5Na3 [ (1,5-COD) Rh * P2W 15Nb3062 ] . The turnover frequency is 2.9 h-1 at 311 K in CH202, which is 100 times greater than its parent Ir compound, [ (1,5COD) IrCl ] 2. This suggests that the presence of the oxidation-resistant basic oxide P2W15Nb3062 enhances the catalytic rate in comparison to Cl- anions to yield the turnover rates 5-120 times higher than those previously reported for Ir catalysts.

Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 333 4.2. Unique reaction fields in solid heteropoly compounds; surface-type, bulk tyO (1), and bulk-type (11) catalysis As described elsewhere [ ld ], the heterogeneous catalytic reactions on heteropoly compounds are classified into three different groups; surface-type, bulktype (I) (pseudoliquidphase), and bulk-type (II). The surface-type reactions belong to the ordinary heterogeneous catalysis which takes place on the twodimensional surface of solid catalysts and therefore the surface acidity or oxidizing ability is important. Reactions of non-polar molecules like isomerization of butenes belong to this class. In the bulk-type (I) reactions, such as dehydration of ethanol or 2-propanol, conversion of methanol, and decomposition of formic acid, the activities correlate well with the bulk acidities, because the reactants can be absorbed by the catalysts and the reactions proceed in the catalyst bulk. The absorption and desorption take place, by substituting water of crystallization and/or by expanding the polyanions interdistance (this is not a diffusion process in micropores) [ 5 ] .The transient response method by using ethanol-do and -ds confirmed that a large amount of ethanol is absorbed by the catalyst bulk and the catalyst effectiveness factor was estimated to be close to unity by means of moment analysis. Thus, heteropoly compounds often behave like a concentrated solution. So we called this state the \"pseudoliquid phase\" [ 1d,5,6,5355 ] . The degree of the bulk contribution to the reaction changes by the rate of reaction relative to that of diffusion, so it depends on the counter cation, the reaction, and the temperature. In the bulk-type (II ), the redox carriers formed on the surface, e.g., proton and electron, migrate rapidly into the solid bulk and enable the whole bulk to participate in the redox cycle although the oxidation of reactant molecule may proceed on the surface. For example, in the case of the reduction of H3PW 12040 by H2, the formation of water from proton and oxygen of heteropolyanion takes place in the whole bulk and is the rate-determining. Such a reaction in the bulk was not observed for the oxidation over Bi-Mo oxides, in which the oxide ion migrates through the bulk. The results of reduction of H3PMo1204o by the pulses of isobutyric acid or methacrolein at 573 K are shown in Fig. 7 [56]. The ordinate indicates the percentage conversion of isobutyric acid or methacrolein for repeated pulses and the abscissa is the extent of reduction of H3PMo120.,o averaged over the whole bulk. The conversion of isobutyric acid gradually decreased while that of methacrolein rapidly decreased. In the former dehydrogenation reaction, the redox carriers are protons and electrons, so that the participation of the whole bulk in the reduction enables the slow reduction of the polyanions on or near the surface. Therefore, the conversion of isobutyric acid gradually decreased. On the other hand, in the latter oxygenation of methacrolein, the redox carriers are oxide ions which migrate very slowly, so that only the reduction on or near the surface is possible and results in a rapid decrease in the conversion. Differences are also reflected in the catalytic oxidations. The rates of cat- 334 o c 0 o d 0 V d Ol G d V a 41 a N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol.

The rates of both reactions of HZ are almost independent of the specific surface area. On the other hand, the rates for CO are proportional to the specific surface area as in the usual heterogeneous catalysis. Thus, not only stoichiometric but also catalytic oxidation reactions can be classified into the following two types [5759]. Surface O. Oxidations of CO, acetaldehyde and methacrolein. Bulk type (II). Oxidation of H2, oxidative dehydrogenations of cyclohexene and isobutyric acid. Since neither the molecular size nor the polarity of reactant molecules is N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catad. 86 (1994) 319-342 335 the factor determining the type of catalysis, the bulk-type (II) catalysis is not revealed by the absorption of reactant molecules into the solid bulk as in the bulk-type (I) catalysis. This mechanism was quantitatively confirmed for the oxidation of H2 [60-63]. In the case of the oxidation of Cd, the redox carriers are electrons and oxide ions which migrate very slowly, so that only the surface can be utilized. Even in the case of CO oxidation, the presence of water vapor accelerates the migration of oxide ion in the form of OH- or H20, and makes the reaction more like bulk-type (II). It is noteworthy that the two industrially important processes to produce methacrylic acid both catalyzed by heteropoly compounds belong to bulk-type (II) and surface-type, respectively (see below). CH3 I CH3-CH-COOH CH3 I CH2=C-CHO Bulk type (II) CH3 I CHZ=C-COOH Surface type This fact, as well as other examples [57,64 ], demonstrates the importance of the concept of the bulk type catalysis in industrial catalysts. 4.3. Cs salts as water-insoluble solid acids The Cs salt formation dramatically increases the surface area [65]; for example, the surface areas of H3PW1204o and Cs2.5Ho.5PW12040 were 6 and 131 m2 g-1, respectively. Cs2.5Ho.5PW12040 after evacuation at 573 K consisted of fine particles (ca. 8 nm in diameter) having uniform distribution of Cs+ and H+ and interparticle micropores less than 4.0 nm in diameter [66,67]. Cs2.5Ho.5PW12040 efficiently catalyzed dehydration of 2-propanol in the gas phase [64] and the decomposition of ether in the liquid phase as a waterinsoluble solid acid [ 68 ] . Recently, it was found that an insoluble acidic Cs2.5Ho.5PW1204o was much more active for liquid-phase alkylation of m-xylene and trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene in a heterogeneous system [ 17,69 ] . Table 6 summarizes the catalytic activities of various solid and liquid catalysts for the alkylation. The data in Table 6 demonstrate that Cs2.5Ho,5PW1204o is much more active than Nafion, HY-zeolite, H-ZSM-5, and 504- /Zr02. It is presumed that the high activity of Cs2,5H0.5PW12040 is brought about primarily by its large number of surface acidic sites and additionally by its acid-base bifunctional nature. 4.4. HeteroOlyanions with mixed addenda Oms Heteropolyanions with mixed addenda atoms exhibit unique catalytic features. The mixing effect is remarkable in the oxidations of cyclopentene and cyclohexene to the corresponding dialdehydes [70,71 ]. For example, in the 336 TABLE 6 N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol.

Prepared from AlC18 and gaseous HCl. a The reactions were carried out at 373 K for 1.5 h, and then the products were analyzed. oxidation of cyclopentene in tributyl phosphate, the catalytic activity of H3PW6MOg04p was the highest among H3PW12-xMox04o catalysts. It is noted that H3PW6MogO4o was a mixture of H3PW12_xMox04o, since, although no mixing of addenda atoms occurs in tributyl phosphate, it takes place during the preparation in aqueous solution. The theoretical explanation of the pronounced effect of the mixing has been attempted by using excess energy [ 72 ] . But there is a possibility that the active peroxo species is formed by partial degradation of the starting Keggin anion. The vanadium-molybdenum mixed addenda Keggin anions, H3+xPMo12-xVx04o, have been used in both homogeneous and heterogeneous oxygenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (see Table 3). In the past PMO10V2044p has been used in its acid form. By contrast, sodium form NabPMoloV204o supported on active carbon has been reported to be active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohols and amines without overoxidation of benzaldehyde and benzylamine [ 73 ] . The inhibition of the over- N. Mizuno and M. Misono / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 319-342 337 oxidation may be due to the lower oxidizing ability of Na6PMo1oV204o than its acid form in the solid state. The mechanism of the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of a-terpinene top-cymene on the mixed addenda PMo1OV2040 has also recently been investigated [ 74 ] . On the basis of the kinetic analysis along with the use of UV-vis, ESR, 31P-NMR, and IR spectroscopy, a reaction scheme is proposed as shown in Fig. 9. In the stage of catalyst reduction, a stable a-terpinene radical (aterpinene*)-H6PMoloV6+V4+040 complex (b) is formed via an electrontranafer complex (a), a reduced heteropolyanion with an oxidized cation radical of a-terpinene. A doubly protonated reduced heteropolyanion and p-cymene are generated through the intermediate. The rate-limiting step is the reoxidation of the catalyst. In the reoxidation step, two reduced H7PMo1oV4+2040 heteropolyanions are reoxidized in a four-electron redox reaction via a,u-peroxo catalyst intermediate (c). 4.5. Description of elementary steps of catalytic reactions Description and elucidation of elementary catalytic steps at the molecular and atomic levels are possible by the utilization of inorganic and organometallic chemistry as well as IR and NMR spectroscopy. Here, the recent study on the reaction of [ (C8H12) Ir (P309) ] [ (nC4H9) 4N ] 2 with molecular oxygen is introduced. Day et al. investigated stepwise the elementary reactions constituting the overall reaction by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction, OZ uptake, and NMR [ 75 ] . The results are shown in Fig.10. Molecular oxygen initially binds to the Ir center to form a rI' O2 complex (b) . Complex (b) reacts with a second Ir center to form a 1t-re-O2, x30-P309 complex (c). Complex (c) then undergoes internal redox reaction to form an isomeric Ir3+ oxo complex (d), of which the coordinated oxygen atoms are inserted into Ir-C bonds to form complex (e). Thermal activation of the complex yields complex (f). The work is interesting not only as a model of alkene epoxidation on Ag catalyst but also as the first example elucidating at atomic level how alkene reacts with molecular oxygen by the catalysis of polyanion. Another example of molecular description is about the reaction in the pseudoliquid. The detailed study on the pseudoliquid phase is carried out by using solid-state NMR combined with IR, thermal desorption, and transientresponse method [ 76-79 ] . Figure 11 shows the pressure dependencies of the rates of formation of diethyl ether and ethylene as well as the amount of ethanol absorbed in the dehydration of ethanol. It was confirmed by the transientresponse method using isotopically labeled ethanol that a large amount of ethanol was absorbed in the lattice of the catalyst bulk under the reaction conditions and that the reaction proceeded in the bulk phase. The product selectivity (diethyl ether vs. ethylene) dramatically depends upon the ethanol partial pressure and thus upon the amount of ethanol in the pseudoliquid phase. 338 ICatatyst Reduction N.

Catal. 88 (1994) 319-342 339 (n-2)C2Hr,OH+(C2H,,OH)2H+.rl~3'(C2H60H),aH+(n>3;inactive) (6) were directly identified in this phase by solid-state NMR and IR. The rates of ethylene and ether formation as well as absorbed ethanol were well reproduced by using n=5, kl=0.002 (g-lh-1), k2=0.032 (g-lh-1), K1=6.8X10-4 (kPa-1),K2=8.8X10-6 (kPa-1),andK3=9.5 X 10-12 (kPa-3).Theunusual Zg.10. Oxygen atom transfer from OZ to a coordinated 1,5-cyclooctadiene. [ (CA2) Ir (P30g )1 I (nC,,H9)4N 12 was used as a starting materials. Fig. 11. Rates of formation of diethyl ether and ethylene from ethanol over H3PW12O,0 (02-basis) as well as the amount of absorbed ethanol under the working conditions as a function of the partial pressure of ethanol. Reaction temperature, 403 K; W/F (ratio of the catalyst weight to the feed rate), 2-60 g h mol-'. pressure dependence observed for the dehydration of ethanol as shown in Fig. 11 was reasonably explained by the changes in the concentration of these intermediates in the pseudoliquid phase. 5. Conclusion Heteropolyanions permit the design of the catalysts at the molecular at atomic level by controlling the structure, for example, the substitution of the elements of polyatoms and heteroatoma, the compleging with organic or organometallic molecules, and the assembly of those molecules. The study on the catalyst design for organic syntheses is an interesting target because heteropolyanions provide acidic and redog properties, pseudoliquid behavior, oxidation resistant ligand, and unique complex formation with various organic or organometallic compounds.
