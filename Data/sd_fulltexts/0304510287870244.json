X. CAI, C. LEPETIT, M. KERMAREC and D. OLIVIER* Laboratoire de Reactivite de Surface et Structure, UA 1106CNRS, Universite P. et M. Curie, 4 Place Jussieu - T. 54 E2, 75252 Paris Cedex 05 (France) (Received January 29, 1987; accepted April 14, 1987) Summary Four, two, or one L = PEt3 ligands are selectively introduced into the coordination sphere of silica-supported Ni(I) ions. Reflectance and EPR spectra are given. The five-coordinate species N^4(0;,) are inactive in C2H4 dimerization. The square planar ?^2(0,5)2 and the unsaturated N1^(0^)2 species are active, stable and selective at 40 C. The best results are observed with two PEt3 ligands: at a conversion of 23%, a selectivity of 95% for 1-butene is obtained. The turnover rates (i;) are about 0.1 s~1. From EPR studies a reaction mechanism is proposed. An intermediate metallacyclopentane is characterized. It is shown that the presence of basic phosphine ligands increases the electron density on nickel and allows an easier desorption of the primary reaction products. Introduction The dimerization of ethylene is economically interesting only if it is selective to 1-butene, which is used as co monomer in the production of low density polyethylene. Dimerization, oligomerization and similar reac- tions of olefins have been reported to be catalyzed by systems containing nickel complexes [1, 2], but recently an industrial homogeneous process (alpha-butol), selective for the dimerization of ethylene into 1-butene and using titania complexes, has been described [3]. With most of the catalysts the catalytic cycle requires the presence of H\"1' or H~ species [4-6]; these species are able to facilitate the isomerization reactions and therefore the corresponding catalysts lead to an isomer mixture in which 2-butenes are the main species. The high selectivity of the 'alpha-butol process' to 1-butene has been correlated with the absence of hydrogenated species. Most of the studies on C^H^ dimerization have been concerned with homogeneous catalysts, but recently articles have appeared describing heterogeneous systems [7-18]. The supported catalysts are less active *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 94 than the homogeneous ones, but they appear more stable versus time and temperature; their poor performances result from a bad control of the dispersion, the oxidation state and the coordination sphere of the active entities. Our approach differs from that generally used in supported homoge- neous catalysis where the active complexes are synthesized outside the support. From an isolated :Ni2\"1\" precursor bonded only to the surface oxygen atoms acting as ligands, we fashion the active entity and its coor- dination sphere at the surface. This catalyst tailoring implies: (1) good dispersion of the precursor cations Ni(II); (2) their unsaturation obtained by a suitable thermal pretreatment; (3) their reduction to the expected oxidation state Ni(I), using mild conditions to avoid migration; (4) the introduction into the coordination sphere of a given number of Lewis bases, such as phosphines, which are known to influence both the activity and the selectivity of the homogeneous processes. The realization of the three first points has been reported in earlier works [16,19-21], nevertheless the reduction degree of the supported Ni(II) ions into Ni(I) was always limited to about 18%. As it has been shown [6, 16] that the catalytic activity of supported nickel catalysts is controlled by the number of Ni(I) ions, the scope of this work has been: (1) to increase the portion of Ni(II) reduced to Ni(I) in order to prepare heterogeneous catalysts containing the highest percentage of Ni(I) com- patible with a good dispersion; (2) to prepare and to characterize silica-supported nickel complexes Ni'Ln (L = PEt3), n varying selectively in the range 1 to 4; (3) to investigate the effect of the number of phosphine ligands on the activity, the stability and the selectivity of these catalysts in the dimeriza- tion of ethylene into 1-butene under industrial pressure conditions; (4) to propose reaction intermediates in order to determine the factors which influence the elementary steps. Experimental The samples studied are nickel-exchanged silicas prepared using the competitive cation exchange method [16, 19-21]. The percentage of nickel by weight lies in the range 1.7 - 5.1%. The samples are pretreated in flowing oxygen up to 773 K, then outgassed overnight at 973 K. The unsaturated character of the Ni(II) coordination sphere is measured by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy [20]. The reduction of supported Ni(II) ions is carried out using triethylphosphine (L) as reductor [22] at 300 K, either in gaseous phase (PL ~ 50 - 300 torr) or in solution with the sample dispersed in toluene ([L]/[Ni] = 6). The percent reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I) is calculated by two independent methods: (1) Ni(I) spin concentration (using Cu(II) as standard); 95 (2) micromanometry using CO as adsorbate; it has been shown by IR spectroscopy that only one CO molecule is adsorbed per Ni(I) ion in the presence of two phosphine ligands. The reduction degree is found to be equal to nearly 58 - 60%. The EPR spectra are recorded at 77 K on a CSE 109 Varian spectro- meter in the X and Q bands, A subharmonic generator (Telmore Instru- ments) is used for recording the third derivative spectra. The g values are measured relative to a DPPH standard (g = 2.0036). IR and UV spectra are worked out from samples mounted in cells which allow pretreatments, reduction and reactivity studies (P < 1 atm). In IR studies the spectra are recorded on a Perkin Elmer 580 B spectrometer at room temperature. Reflectance spectra are carried out on a Beckman 5270 spectrometer in the range 200 - 2500 nm. Dimerization of ethylene is conducted either in a batch or in a flow reactor (flow rate: 3 -12 1 h~1) under 20 - 30 bar ethylene pressure. The sample weight is ~150 mg. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chro- matography on a GIRA instrument equipped with flame ionisation detector, using a 0.26 mm X 50 m silica column with a stationary phase of squalane. C2H4 was purified before use by contacting it with an active molecular sieve. 90% * ^-enriched CO was supplied by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and used after condensing possible oxygen impurity traces at liquid nitrogen temperature. Results and discussion Preparation and spectroscopic characterization of supported NiI(PEt3)n complexes The reflectance spectra and the EPR spectra of the reduced samples are followed first as a function of PEt3 pressure at 25 C, then after out- gassing at increasing temperatures. The symmetry of the supported Ni(I) complexes is determinated from the comparison of their reflectance spectra with those observed for organo- metallic Ni(I) complexes. The discussion of the EPR spectra is based on a self-consistent analysis of: (i) the g tensor components which give the symmetry of the environ- ment of the paramagnetic 3d9 Ni(I) ions; (ii) the relative order of the g tensor components which leads to the probable ground state of the Ni(I) ions; (iii) the superhyperfine (shf) structure due to 31? (I = 'A) from which the number of phosphine ligands can be deduced. After reduction under a relatively high pressure of PEt3 (P> 60 torr) two species, A and B, predominate. The reflectance spectra of A is charac- terized by three bands: A, = 1400 nm, A^ = 350 nm, A3 = 282 nm (Fig. 1). In the same experimental conditions, the EPR spectra in Q band (Fig. 2) 96 (b) reduced by PEts at 25 C (P > 60 torr). are typical of an axially symmetric d9 system in which the unpaired electron occupies the d^i_y2 ground state. In X band (Fig. 2), the shf structure resulting from the interaction of the unpaired electron with the \"P nuclei is resolved on the third derivative spectra: each g tensor component is split into five lines with an intensity ratio of about 1:4:6:4:1, corresponding to four equivalent phosphine ligands. The ESR parameters of the species A are g// = 2.27, A// = 40 G; gi = 2.065, A^ = 50 G. When the PEta pressure increases, the relative ESR intensity of A signal increases at the expense of B, whereas the total spin concentration remains constant. In an earlier work [16] it was shown that the higher coordination number of supported Ni(I) ions is five. The supported [NiI(PEt3)4]+ com- plex being bonded to the surface by at least one oxygen atom (Og) of net ionic charge equal to one, species A are assigned to five-coordinate Ni(I) species NiI(Os)(PEt3)4. Five-coordinate Ni(I) complexes have been observed either in D3h symmetry (trigonal bipyramid) [23, 24] or in C4v symmetry [25, 26]. It has been shown [27] that the stabilities of the two structures are not very different, but for a d9 configuration, a d^i_y2 ground state is observed only for a C^ symmetry. The reflectance spectra of species A show essentially one d-d transition: the broad A; band at 1400 nm. The intense high frequency band at 282 nm (A3) can be associated with an electron transfer transition, while the less intense band at 350 nm can be ascribed to a forbidden transition. The d-d transition (Ai) is observed at a wavelength higher than that expected for D3h five-coordinate Ni(I) com- plexes (760-1300 nm) [24,29]; the experimental results with d^_y, ground state, equivalent coupling with four \"P nuclei, broad d-d transition at 1400 nm, are more consistent with a square pyramidal structure (C4v) [28]. The rvalue components of species A are nevertheless slightly higher 7 8 U100 nm Fig. 1. Reflectance spectra of N^/SiO^ (5.1 Ni%); (a) pretreated at 700 C (NiII(Os)3), 97 Fig. 2.

This shift may be explained by a distortion resulting from the steric hin- drance of the surface, or from the interaction of the phosphine ligands with the silica surface. By decreasing the PEt3 pressure at 25 C, two bands are developed at the expense of A bands in the reflectance spectra: a strong, narrow band (AX ~ 100 nm) Bi at 880 nm and B; at 500 nm (Fig. 3). Species B predom- inates after outgassing at 25 C. The weak bands observed at about 1800 nm and the shoulder at 950 nm can be assigned to four-coordinate [20] unreduced Ni(II) ions; a third electronic transition should be observed between 430 and 610 nm, and is probably superimposed on the band B2. The EPR spectra recorded in the same experimental conditions are reported in Fig. 4. In the Q band an EPR signal B, with axial symmetry and g-value components close to those of NiI(Os)(PEt3)4, is observed: g/ = 2.28, g^ = 2.087. The corresponding ground state is d^i_yi; a shoulder is visible at g = 2.32. We shall see that it corresponds to a new species C, for which the EPR intensity increases when the outgassing temperature in- creases. It is difficult to obtain pure B species; the analysis of the shf struc- ture is thus difficult. 98 Fig. 3.

For a D3h symmetry the d-d transition observed on the reflectance spectra is generally broad (AX ~ 500 nm) [23,24], whereas a strong but narrow (AX ~ 300 nm) band is expected for Ta symmetry [31]. As species B are obtained by outgassing of the five-coordinate A spe- cies and as the d-d transition Bi is a strong narrow band, we propose to associate species B to tetrahedral Ni(I) complexes: NiI(Os)(PEt3)3, bonded to the surface by one oxygen atom Og. After prolonged outgassing at 100 C, the bands Bi and Ba progressively disappear from the reflectance spectra (Fig. 3), whereas the intensity of two new broad bands increases in the UV range: Ci at 465 nm and C; at 330 nm. In the same experimental conditions, the EPR spectra (Fig. 5) recorded in X and Q bands show the presence of only one d9 paramagnetic species C of axial symmetry and dyi_yi ground state gi = 2.320, g^ = 2.083. Each component of the g tensor appears split in the X band by the shf coupling with \"P nuclei. The shf structure may be resolved for the perpendicular component which appears divided into four bands of equivalent intensity. The intensity distribution is consistent with an inequivalent coupling with two \"P nuclei: A, =85G A, = 62 G The reflectance spectra of the C species do not show any bands of wave- length higher than 500 nm, and the UV bands Ci and C^ are characteristic of square planar Ni(I) complexes [32- 34]. The square planar symmetry Fig. 6. EPR spectra (77 K) of Ni\"/Si02 (5.1 Ni%) reduced by PEta at 25 C, then evac- uated 3 h at 100 C; (a) X band, (b) Q band. 100 agrees with the d^2_yi ground state observed in EPR [35, 36]. The inequiv- alent coupling with the two phosphine ligands suggests a distortion of the structure. We conclude that by outgassing at 100 C the tetrahedral species B are transformed into square planar Ni(I) complexes bonded to the surface by two oxygen atoms following the reaction: NiI(0,)(PEt3)3 ?=\" Ni^O^PEta);; + PEta Thus the reversibility of the equilibrium has been checked. One of the surface oxygens acts as a negative monovalent ligand, whereas the other is a neutral a donor ligand. The reflectance spectrum is simplified by evacuation at 200 C. The Ci and bands are no longer observed (Fig. 3); only a broad band D is ob- served at about 400 nm. In the same conditions the EPR spectra are dras- tically transformed (Fig. 6): the intensity of a new signal D increases at the expense of C, which progressively disappears; the resultant spectrum is typical of an axially symmetric Ni(I) species in a d^ ground state (g^ > 81 ~ e)'- the 8 parameters are g^ = 2.125, 8i = 2.013. The g component is split in X band into two lines of equivalent intensity by coupling with one \"P nucleus A^ = 70 G. The total Ni(I) spin concentration slightly decreases by prolonged outgassing at 250 C, but the initial spin concentration is restored by subsequent adsorption of phosphine or CO. Species D contain only one phosphine ligand in the coordination sphere of Ni(I); they are obtained by elimination of one phosphine mole- cule from the diphosphine species C following the equilibrium: NiI(PEt3)2 ^=^ Ni^PEta) + PEta Fig. 6. EPR spectra (77 K) of N^/SiOz (5.1 Ni%) reduced by PEta at 25 C, then evac- uated 1 h at 250 C; (a) X band, (b) Q band. 101 On the basis of the fact that the d9 four-coordinate complexes, both square planar and tetrahedral, show electronic transitions at wavelengths higher than 400 nm, D species cannot be associated to tetrahedral species similar to the surface Ni^CO^O^ complexes observed on silica [16]. Electronic spectra similar to D have been reported for unsaturated Ni(I) complexes, three-coordinate in a distorted Dy^ or C3v symmetry [37]. It is not so clear what the expected ground state of a three-coordinate Ni(I) complex would be, but for some geometries, a d^i ground state would be possible. A notice- able feature is that A// is not resolved, but this has been observed in similar three-coordinate Ni(I) species and explained in terms of a positive dipolar coupling tensor for the d^i orbital. From these experimental results, we propose that D species are unsaturated three-coordinate Ni^C^zPEta com- plexes, bonded to the surface by two oxygen atoms, one of them having a negative ionic charge. The reversible loss of spin concentration observed after prolonged outgassing at 250 C is explained by the removal of the last phosphine ligand and the formation of unsaturated Ni^t^a species which are EPR-inactive [21]. Table 1 summarizes the results and discussion. From this study it is shown that it is possible to introduce selectively 4, 2 or 1 PEta molecule in the coordination sphere of supported Ni(I) ions. The saturated five- coordinate species NiI(Os)(PEt3)4 are stable under a phosphine pressure higher than 60 torr.

A tetrahedral species, probably NiI(Os)(PEt3)3 appears stable under vacuum at room temperature. The ranges of the g tensor in paramagnetic homogeneous Ni(I) complexes are reported in Fig. 7. It appears that the g tensor com- ponents of the surface NiI(PEt3)n species are similar to those of the organo- metallic Ni(I) compounds of the same symmetry. Electron donor properties of phosphorus ligands The electron donor properties of phosphorus ligands have been inves- tigated using CO as probe molecule. The surface complexes NiI(Os);(PEt3)n,- (C0)n (I + m + n < 5) have been characterized by IR and EPR spectro- scopies. IR study Five torr CO pressure is successively adsorbed onto: (i) a mixture of NiI(Os)(PEt3)3 and NiI(Os)2(PEt3)2 (B + C species) (ii) NiI(Os)2(PEt3)2 (C species) (iii) Nil[(08)2PEt3 (D species) In all three cases only one v(CO) band is observed. In Fig. 8, v(CO) frequency is reported versus the number of phosphine ligands. Successive additions of phosphine ligand cause v(CO) to change by a nearly constant increment. It is possible to assign to each number of PEt3 ligands a con- tribution to the (/(CO) stretching frequency, but this correlation should be available only for phosphine of the same basicity, i.e. with the same substituent on the phosphorus atoms. The photoassisted reduction under CO of supported Ni(II) ions has been reported in another work [21]. The adsorption of 4 torr of PEt3 onto the photoreduced sample in the presence of a residual CO pressure of about 20 torr, followed by outgassing at 25 C, leads to a mixture of Ni(I) species containing one (2044 cm\"1), two (1990 103 2000 1900 Fig. 8. r(CO) frequency versus the number of PEt3 ligands in the coordination sphere of supported Ni(I) ions obtained by: reduction by PEt3, A photoreduction under H^, o photoreduction under CO. cm\"1) and three (1915 cm\"1) phosphine ligands (Fig. 9). In these condi- tions the formation of metal is not observed, as shown by the absence of a ferromagnetic signal in the EPR spectra recorded in the same experi- mental conditions. Bands in the range 1850 -1750 cm\"! have been assigned [21] to superficial carbonate species. The bands r(CO) characteristic of [NiI(PEt3)3CO]+ and [Ni^PEta);^^ species are removed by evacuation at 150 C, whereas the intensity of the band assigned to [Ni^PEta^O]\"1\" only decreases. The v(CO) band at 2080 cm~1 is characteristic of Ni^CO)- (Og)3 species [16]. A subsequent adsorption of 5 torr CO shows that there Fig. 9. IR spectra of a N^/SiO^ sample photoreduced under CO and after (a) adsorption of 4 torr PEt3 in the presence of a residual CO pressure of about 20 torr, (b) (a) + out- gassing 1 h at 150 C, (c) (b) + adsorption of 5 torr CO, (d) (c) + outgassing 1 h at 200 C, (e) (d) + adsorption of 5 torr CO. 104 remain only two (or one) phosphine ligands on Ni(I) surface species. Out- gassing at 200 C removes all the v(CO) bands except that of Ni^CO^O^. After a new adsorption of 5 torr CO pressure, it appears that the principal surface species are [NiI(PEt3)CO]+ and Ni^O^CO. From these results we conclude that: (i) an increase in the number of phosphine ligands in the coordination sphere increases the electronic charge on the metal, thus the back donation of electrons from Ni(I) to CO; (ii) an increase in the number of phosphine ligands allows easier desorp- tion of the CO molecules. EPR study The adsorption of 5 torr CO pressure onto a sample containing mainly NiI(PEt3)2(Os)2 species leads to a new EPR spectrum E, reported in Fig. 10. The g tensor components are measured in the Q band: gi = 2.176, g^ = 2.092, ^3 = 2.034. Each component is split into three lines in the X band, and the relative intensity ratio (1:2:1) shows an equivalent interaction with two 31? nuclei. A weak signal observed at g = 2.28 results from the presence of traces of NiI(Os)(PEt3)3 species. The EPR spectrum does not change when the pressure is increased up to 300 torr. The same experiment was carried out with 90% \"C-enriched CO. The EPR spectrum is similar in Q band, but is broadened in X band by the shf coupling with the \"C (/ = V2} nuclei. The resolution of the shf structure is impossible because of the superimposition of the two structures (\"P and \"C). It has been shown by IR that under 5 torr CO pressure, only one CO molecule enters into the Fig. 10. EPR spectra (77 K), of Ni^PEts^/SiO;, after adsorption of 5 torr CO pressure; (a) X band, (b) Q band. 105 coordination sphere of Ni(I). The EPR spectrum does not change with pressure; in the presence of two phosphine ligands it is thus impossible to add more than one molecule of CO even under 300 torr. The case of NiI(Os)2(PEt3) is different. The EPR spectrum obtained after 5 torr CO adsorption (Fig. 11) is drastically modified when the pres- sure is increased up to 300 torr (Fig. 11). In Q band three species may be detected: the species E', and two new species F and G. The intensity of F and G increases when the CO pressure increases F:gi=2.12 G: ^i=2.10 g2 = 2.07 g2 = 2.04 ^3=2.01 g3 = 1.98 The g values of F and G are not very different from those of the five- coordinate species NiI(CO)4(Os) [16]. The shf structure due to \"C and ^P is not resolved in X band, but as these species are observed only under high CO pressure, we propose to assign F and G signals to five-coordinate surface complexes containing two and three CO molecules in the coordina- tion sphere of Ni(I) ions: NiI(PEt3)(CO)2(Os)2 and NiI(PEt3)(CO)3(Os). In the absence of phosphine ligands, supported Ni(I) ions coordi- nate four CO molecules under 300 torr CO pressure, and five-coordinate Nix(CO)4(Os) species are formed, whereas in the presence of two PEt3 ligands, it is impossible to add more than one CO molecule: the increase of the electronic density on the metal decreases the affinity of Ni(I) ions for soft Lewis bases such as CO.

In a batch, the reaction is followed under 20 bar C2H4 pressure at 25 C. The reactivity of the supported Ni(II) precursors is compared to that of the reduced samples containing 0 - 4 PEt3 ligands. In a previous work [16] we have shown that (i) the higher coordination number of Ni(I) ions is 5; (ii) the case of two olefin molecules bonded to the same Ni(I) is favorable for the dimerization to take place. Indeed, it is observed that the saturated Ni(I) species with 3 or 4 PEt3 ligands are inactive. It has also been checked that Ni(0) particles hyperdispersed on silica [38] (particle size in the range 10 -15 A) are also inactive. An induction time was observed in the case of the unreduced catalysts; this corresponds to the reduction of the Ni(II) species to Ni(I), as is shown by EPR after reaction. This result confirms that the Ni(I) sites are the active entities [16]. The time dependence of the composition of the gaseous phase shows the isomerization of 1-butene into 2-butene. Figure 12 compares the experi- mental results as a function of the number of PEt3 ligands on Ni(I), at a conversion of about 23%. In the absence of phosphine, the selectivity for dimerization is lim- ited to 40%. The oligomerization products are mainly Cg oligomers having the composition 30% linear hexenes, 62% methylpentenes, 8% dimethyl- butenes. A strong increase in dimerization selectivity is observed with n PEt Fig. 12. Ethylene dimerization over NiI(PEt3)n/Si02 catalysts in a batch reactor (T = 25 C, Po= 20 bar, V= 100 ml); SQ: dimerization selectivity (%), SB: dimer distribution (mol%) 1-butene, C: conversion (%). 107 the phosphine-modified catalysts. The highest, 90%, is achieved using Ni1- (PEt3)2(Os)2 species. The composition of the dimer fraction is strongly dependent on the presence of phosphine. At the same conversion degree (23%), the percentage of 1-butene increases from 40% with the phosphine-free catalyst to 95% for the Ni^PEta);^); catalysts. Figure 13 summarizes the experimental results when C;^ dimerization is carried out in a flow reactor at 25 C, under 20 bar C^H.^ pressure at a conversion of about 5%. The activity of the phosphine-modified Ni(I) sites remains stable after more than 24 h, while in the absence of phosphine a loss of about 85% of the activity is observed after 3 h. The selectivity for dimerization, initially good for all the samples, decreases rapidly in the absence of phosphine. As was observed in a batch reactor, the dimer composition is controlled by the phosphine ligands. The highest selectivity for 1-butene (higher than 98%) is achieved using the diphosphine catalysts, whereas in the case of the phosphine-free catalyst, the percentage of 1-butene never exceeds 71%. The percentage of hexene and higher oligomers slightly increases when the reaction temperature increases and when C2H4 pressure increases (Fig. 14). The selectivity for 1-butene slightly decreases when the temperature increases and when the pressure decreases (Fig. 14). For the NiI(PEt3)2(Os)2 centers, the turnover rate varies between 5 X 10~2 to 10~1 s~1 depending on the experimental conditions (Table 2). The corresponding rate for the industrial homogeneous catalysts of the alpha-butol process is about 3 s~1. On the other hand, selectivity of the supported Ni(I) phosphine-modified catalysts is very much higher than that of the homogeneous nickel catalysts [2, 6, 39]. 1 2 3 T>PEt3 \" Fig. 13.

After adsorption of 600 torr C2H4 at 25 C, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h and the reaction products analyzed by GC. They are similar to those observed under 20 bar C2H4 pressure. The EPR spectra were recorded before and after outgassing of the reaction products. With the diphosphine Ni(I) catalyst, the conversion of C2H4 is complete; in that case the EPR signal of NiI(PEt3)2(Os)2 is the only signal observed before and after outgassing and its intensity is equal to that observed before C2H4 adsorption, whereas with phosphine-free catalysts adsorbed butenes and hexenes are evidenced by both EPR [16] and IR spectroscopies. If there is only one PEt3 ligand, reaction products remain also partly adsorbed on the Ni(I) centers after outgassing, as is evidenced by two EPR signals observed at g = 2.077 and g= 2.018 which correspond to the per- pendicular components of the surface complexes formed by direct adsorp- tion of butene and hexenes. The IR studies have shown that one of the functions of the phosphine Lewis bases is to increase the charge on the nickel ion proportionally to the number of phosphine ligands, decreasing thereby the affinity of the Ni(I) sites for soft donors such as CO and olefin molecules. This explains the easier desorption of the reaction products from the diphosphine catalyst. EPR spectra were also recorded during the reaction. Adsorption of 600 torr C2H4 onto NiI(PEt3)2(Os)2 at 77 K leaves the EPR spectra un- changed, but when the sample is warmed to 25 C, the intensity of the signal of the diphosphine complex immediately decreases and finally dis- appears, whereas the intensity of two new signals Ii and 12 simultaneously increases, remains nearly constant during several hours, and finally decreases progressively to zero at the end of the reaction (Fig. 15). The corresponding species I; and 12 appear as intermediates in a series of successive reactions. Their g tensor components measured in Q band are: [-&= 2.532 rgi= 2.256 11 I2 [g//= 1.954 [g//= 2.066 The 31? shf structure of 11 is poorly resolved in X band, but it is clear that the broadened perpendicular component remains centered on the g value measured in Q band. No shf broadening is observed on the parallel com- ponent. These results lead us to propose an equivalent interaction of the unpaired electron with two 31? nuclei in the perpendicular direction. The shf structure of 12 is well resolved in X band. Each g component is divided into two bands indicating a coupling with only one 31? in each direction. For comparison, in another experiment we adsorbed 600 torr butadi- ene onto the Ni^ PEt3) 2(0,) 2 species (Fig. 16). The EPR signal observed, 110 Fig. 15. EPR spectra (77 K) of Ni^PEta^/S^.

B, is quite similar to Ii except that it does not change with time, and we have verified that no oligomerization reaction occurs. The symmetry of the ESR signal Ii (gi>g// ~ ge) corresponds to a d^ ground state. For saturated Ni(I) species, a d^ ground state is generally observed with a five-coordinate complex of D3h symmetry. On the other hand, adsorption of butadiene onto metallic cations has been described as formation of TT-bonded complexes [2, 40, 41]: L\\ I ^M-|l L^| L with the butadiene ligand in meridional position in the five-coordinate species [42]. By analogy, we propose the following structure for the complex re- sulting from the adsorption of butadiene onto diphosphine species: ^i.-, Et^i Ill The EPR bands of Ii and of the Ni(I) butadiene species are similar, further- more we have shown that two olefin molecules are bonded on each Ni(I) when the dimerization takes place. This leads us to propose that species Ii results from the equilibrium between the two following species: EtaP^T, Et3P^\\ . / Ni1- || ^ .Ni^ Et3P<l Et3P<_ '-s -S (a) (b) The experimental results do not allow us to choose between (a) and (b). Nevertheless, the evolution of the intensity of Ii with time shows that this intermediate is relatively stable, and it is generally admitted that in the reactions of concerted coupling of olefin molecules, the diethylene com- plex is in equilibrium with the metallacyclopentane, the limiting step being the decomposition of the metallacyclic compound: M-ll M+ This suggests the assignment of species Ii to the metallacyclic intermediate (b), for which an EPR coupling with two phosphine molecules would be expected in the perpendicular direction. By analogy, we propose to associate l^ with the isomer in which the metallacyclic ligand is in the equatorial plane: PEt3 PEt3 ^NiI PEt3 ,=^ /^>NiI-PEt3 ^0. <^. The proposed structure of \\i agrees with the EPR spectra, as a strong coupling of the unpaired electron with one \"P nuclei is observed either in the parallel direction or in the perpendicular one. The same studies have been performed with the monophosphine Ni(I) complexes. In this case, only one signal I'i similar to I; is observed at g^ = 2.41 and g, = 1.98 (Fig. 17). The shf structure with \"P is only resolved on the perpendicular component A^ = 60 G. The adsorption of butadiene leads to species B' similar to species B with g^ = 2.45, g/ = 1.95. I'i is asso- ciated with two intermediate species: ^\\ ^ ^ Et3? 1 Os EtsP ^ 0, 0, 0, for which the shf structure is expected in the perpendicular direction. 112 Fig. 17. EPR spectra (77 K, X band) after reaction of Ni^PEtaVSiOa with 600 torr CzH4 pressure: (a) 1 min at 25 C, I'i: gj_ = 2.41, A^ = 60 G, g, = 1.98; (b) 5 h at 25 C, I'i=NiI(03)2(PEt3)(C4Hg). These results can be compared with those previously reported by Bonneviot et al. [16] after C^-i^ adsorption onto Ni^t^a species, where an intermediate with the following g tensor has been observed: g^ = 2.47, gn = 1.98. By analogy we propose to assign this latter species to: //- 0' :Ni1: i 0- Mechanism The fact that the total Ni(I) spin concentration remains constant during the catalytic cycle rules out the presence of stable hydride species, which have been proposed by several authors following the reaction [43, 44]: 2Ni1 + olefin ?^ HN^-allyl When dimerization takes place, two olefins must be bonded to each Ni(I) ion, and we propose metallacyclopentane as a stable reaction intermediate. This leads us to propose the mechanism shown in Fig. 18 to explain the dimerization of C2H4 on supported Ni(I) complexes. The selectivity of the reaction strongly depends on the value of the equilibrium constant K^. In the presence of two phosphine molecules, we 113 t r i m e r s Fig. 18. Proposed reaction mechanism for dimerization of C^H^ on supported Ni(I) com- plexes. have shown that the electron density on Ni(I) is increased and that the affinity of the nickel for soft Lewis bases such as CO or olefins is strongly decreased. The consequences are that the equilibrium 5 is shifted to the right, and the reactions of codimerization and/or isomerization will be little or not at all observed. This explains the increase of the selectivity for dimerization and partly the selectivity for 1-butene. But it has been shown [44, 45] that olefin isomerization is also catalyzed by acidic sites. We have verified by IR that one part of PEt3 reacts irreversibly with the acidic OH surface groups, cancelling the other part's 1-butene isomerization sites. How can we explain the adsorption of two C2H4 molecules on Ni(I) in the presence of phosphine? We think that the great stability of the inter- mediate metallacyclopentane towards either homolytic decomposition or elimination [46] shifts the equilibrium (1) towards the right. Conclusions In this work we have shown that immobilization of ions on a support is an elegant way to stabilize unusual oxidation states and coordination numbers. We have prepared well-defined surface Ni(I) complexes by a smooth chemical reduction at 25 C of well-defined Ni(II) precursors. The reduction degree has been increased up to 60% using alkylphosphine as reductor. We have selectively introduced four, two or one phosphine ligands into the coordination sphere of the surface Ni(I) ions. The spectroscopic characteristics of the surface compounds are very close to those of the 114 Ni(I) complexes in coordination chemistry, showing that the surface oxygen ions act as a ligand L in the coordination sphere. The saturated species NiI(PEt3)4(Os) are 19 e complexes, bonded to the surface by one Og ion with one negative net ionic charge in a C^y symmetry. The diphosphine entities NiI(PEt3)2(Oj,)2 are square planar 17 e radicals bonded to the surface by two oxygen ions. The monophosphine complexes NiI(PEt3)(Os)2 are very unsaturated 15 e radicals bonded to the surface by two surface Og. When the complexes are bonded to the surface by two or three oxygen ions, only one of them carries one negative net ionic charge. The saturated five-coordinate species are inactive in C2H4 dimerization, whereas the two unsaturated complexes (Ni1!^)'1' and (Ni'L)\"*\" are both active. We have characterized a metallacyclopentane intermediate resulting from a concerted coupling of two olefin molecules on each Ni(I) center. We have shown that the critical steps of the reaction are the decomposition of the metallacyclic intermediate into 1-butene and the desorption of 1-butene from the Ni(I) sites. This study allows us to construct a mechanism which suggests predic- tions and allows the design of a better catalyst to modify the rates and products. With this system it is possible to control the activity, the stability and the selectivity by the electronic effect of the ligands. The presence of basic phosphine ligands increases the electron density on the metal, thus de- creasing the affinity of the Ni(I) ions for the a donor molecules. This elec- tronic effect allows an easier desorption of the primary reaction products and the consequences are: (i) a strong increase in the selectivity for dimerization and in the stability of the catalytic sites poisoned by heavy oligomers in the phosphine- free catalysts; (ii) a strong increase in the selectivity for the dimerization of C2H4 into 1-butene, which reaches 95% at a conversion of 23% with the catalyst Ni^PEt^O^. The activity of these heterogeneous catalysts may be compared to that of the industrial homogeneous ones. The turnover rate is about 0.1 s~1, and they possess very good stability. This work shows that the tailoring of supported catalysts with charac- teristics and catalytic performances similar to those of homogeneous cata- lysts is possible, provided the reaction mechanism is understood, the factors which influence the kinetic parameters are well known and the coordination sphere is controlled for each step of the catalyst treatment.

Four, two, or one L = PEt3 ligands are selectively introduced into the coordination sphere of silica-supported Ni(I) ions. Reflectance and EPR spectra are given. The five-coordinate species NiIL4(Os) are inactive in C2H4 dimerization. The square planar NiIL2(O5)2 and the unsaturated NiIL(Os)2 species are active, stable and selective at 40 °C. The best results are observed with two PEt3 ligands: at a conversion of 23%, a selectivity of 95% for 1-butene is obtained. The turnover rates (v) are about 0.1 s−1. From EPR studies a reaction mechanism is proposed. An intermediate metallacyclopentane is characterized. It is shown that the presence of basic phosphine ligands increases the electron density on nickel and allows an easier desorption of the primary reaction products. References 1 P.W. Jolly G.

        "dc:description": "Four, two, or one L = PEt3 ligands are selectively introduced into the coordination sphere of silica-supported Ni(I) ions. Reflectance and EPR spectra are given. The five-coordinate species NiIL4(Os) are inactive in C2H4 dimerization. The square planar NiIL2(O5)2 and the unsaturated NiIL(Os)2 species are active, stable and selective at 40 °C. The best results are observed with two PEt3 ligands: at a conversion of 23%, a selectivity of 95% for 1-butene is obtained. The turnover rates (v) are about 0.1 s−1. From EPR studies a reaction mechanism is proposed. An intermediate metallacyclopentane is characterized. It is shown that the presence of basic phosphine ligands increases the electron density on nickel and allows an easier desorption of the primary reaction products.",
