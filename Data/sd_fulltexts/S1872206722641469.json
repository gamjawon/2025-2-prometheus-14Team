Manipulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to optimize the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates during the 4e− ORR offers a practical route toward improving ORR kinetics. Herein, we designed a novel ORR electrocatalyst containing Co single atoms and nanoparticles supported by carbon dots-derived carbon nanoflowers (Co SAs/NPs CNF). Co SAs/NPs CNF possessed a very high ORR activity (E 1/2 of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst is 0.83 V (vs. RHE)), and outstanding catalytic performance and stability when used as the air-electrode catalyst in rechargeable ZABs (152.32 mW cm−2, 1000.58 mWh gZn −1, and over 1300 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm−2). The Co SAs and Co NPs cooperated to improve electron and proton transfer processes during ORR. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of adjacent Co NPs optimized the electronic structure of the isolated Co-N4 sites, significantly lowering the energy barriers for the rate-determining step in ORR (adsorption of *OOH) and thereby delivering outstanding ORR performance. This work reveals that the combination of supported single-atom sites and metal nanoparticles can be highly beneficial for ORR electrocatalysis, outperforming catalysts containing only Co SAs or Co NPs. Graphical Abstract The comprising cobalt SAs and NPs supported on carbon nanoflowers (Co SAs/NPs CNF) delivered outstanding ORR activity and high energy density (1000.58 mWh gZn −1) for Zn-air batteries. Keywords Carbon dots Co single atom Co nanoparticle Oxygen reduction reaction Zn-air battery 1 Introduction Current environmental issues linked to the burning of fossil fuels for energy motivate the development of efficient storage/conversion technologies that will allow the widespread future exploitation of renewable energy sources. In this context, Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are currently attracting much attention due to their high energy densities (1086 mWh gZn −1), low cost, and ease of recycling. It is envisaged that ZABs could replace lithium-ion batteries in many applications, including power sources for electric vehicles [1–6]. During discharge, ZABs utilize the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at an air-electrode (cathode) and zinc metal oxidation at the anode (with the oxygen evolution reaction and Zn2+ reduction, respectively, occurring at these same electrodes during recharge). The kinetics of the four proton-electron ORR/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes at the cathode controls the overall efficiency of ZABs [7]. The design and fabrication of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts are crucial to the development and further commercialization of both primary and secondary ZABs. Currently, Pt-based electrocatalysts are considered the most effective all-round ORR electrocatalysts. However, the scarcity, high price, and modest stability of platinum-based catalysts are serious obstacles to the commercial production of cells [8–10]. Therefore, the discovery of non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is imperative for ORR [7,11,12]. In this regard, much effort has been devoted to the development of carbon-supported first-row transition metal electrocatalysts for ORR in recent years [13–19]. Carbon dots (CDs) are zero-dimensional carbon materials with extremely small dimensions (typically only a few nanometers in all dimensions). Compared with other carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene and carbon black), CDs have multiple advantages such as simple synthesis via bottom-up methods, low toxicity, high electrical conductivity, and fascinating optical properties (photoluminescence) due to quantum-size effects. Accordingly, they are increasingly used as electrocatalysis and conductive carbon supports [20–22]. Previously, we used CDs to construct efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER performance [23–29]. Generally, CDs have a crystalline sp 2-hybridized core and abundant edge sites supporting different functional groups (e.g., -NH2, -COOH, and -OH). These surface functional groups provide strong anchoring sites for transition metal atoms, thus enabling the fabrication of a diverse array of transition metal-containing carbon-supported catalysts. Cross-linking of metal-decorated CDs into arrays, followed by thermal pyrolysis processes, effectively avoids the thermal aggregation of metals into large nanoparticles (thus producing metal single atom sites or very small metal nanoparticles for optimal electrocatalytic activity). Benefitting from these advantages, CDs represent ideal building blocks in the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin carbon materials with homogeneously distributed metal active sites [27,29], and three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures such as nanoflowers incorporating 1D/2D features. The enhanced electrochemically active surface area of such CDs-derived electrocatalysts confers many advantages, such as optimized adsorption of reactants and reaction intermediates, fast proton and electron transfer processes, and greatly improved electrocatalytic ORR performance [15,30,31] relative to conventional pyrolysis-derived carbon ORR catalysts based on polymeric or biomass-derived 3D precursors. In this work, we used CDs as building blocks to construct a Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst for ORR, comprising both Co single atom sites (SAs) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed over a carbon nanoflower (CNF) support. The petals of nanoflower support were ultrathin (thickness of ~3.66 nm), thus offering a high surface area for the uniform distribution of Co SAs and Co NPs, whilst also ensuring well-exposed active sites for high-efficiency ORR. Co SAs/NPs CNF shows excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.83 V, a diffusion limiting current density (j L) of 6.13 mA cm−2, and a low Tafel slope of 89.11 mV dec−1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the large overlap between Co-d and O-2p states facilitated *OOH adsorption (the RDS in ORR).When used in a rechargeable ZAB as the air-electrode catalyst, Co SAs/NPs CNF delivered a device with a high power density (152.32 mW cm−2), high specific capacity (819.93 mAh gZn −1), high energy density (1000.58 mWh gZn −1), and long-term cycle stability (>1300 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm−2). The energy density of the ZAB constructed using Co SAs/NPs CNF was 93.69% of the theoretical energy density. This work highlights the critical influence of metal nanoparticles in modulating/optimizing the electronic structure of metal single atom sites during ORR, thus providing a solid framework for the rational design of superior performance single-atom electrocatalysts for ORR and other applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemical reagents including citric acid (99.5%), melamine (99%), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99%), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, 99%), potaasium hydroxide (KOH, 85%), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, 99.5%), zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99%), potassium thiocyanate (KSCN, 99%), methanol (99.5%), ethanol (99.5%), Nafion solution (5 wt%) were purchased from Aladdin. Commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 2.2 Synthesis of Co SAs/NPs CNF and reference catalysts The Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst was synthesized as follows. Firstly, 2.88 g (15 mmol) of citric acid and 1.89 g (15 mmol) of melamine were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water, with the resulting solution then heated hydrothermally in an autoclave at 200 °C for 5 h. The product is naturally cooled to room temperature and filtered to remove solids, resulting in a yellow liquid called citric acid-melamine carbon dots (CM-CDS) dispersion. Next, 0.18 g (0.75 mmol) of CoCl2·6H2O and 0.11 g (0.75 mmol) of hexamethylenetetramine were dissolved in 30 mL of the CM-CDs dispersion under constant stirring. The resulting dispersion was then transferred to an autoclave and heated hydrothermally at 200 °C for 5 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, the collected precipitates were centrifuged and vacuum-dried. The dried powder was then heated to 800 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under the flowing Ar atmosphere and then maintained at this temperature for 2 h. The resulting sample is denoted as Co SAs/NPs CNF. For reference purposes, a set of control catalysts were prepared under similar conditions as the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst, except that one or more experimental changes were made. CM-SH was obtained without adding CoCl2·6H2O and HMT in the second hydrothermal step. CM-HMT was obtained by adding only HMT in the second hydrothermal step. Co3O4/C was obtained by adding HMT directly to the CM-CDs dispersion in the second hydrothermal step. CM-800 was obtained by heating the freeze-dried CM-CDs solid powder at 800 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h. 2.3 Assembly of the Zn-air batteries Catalyst (8 mg), super C (1 mg), and 5 wt% Nafion (20 mg) were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol (2 mL) to form catalyst ink. The catalyst ink was then applied dropwise to a carbon cloth, hydrophobic membrane, and nickel foam composite to achieve a catalyst loading of 1 mg cm−2. The prepared air cathodes and Zn plate (anode) were assembled into zinc-air batteries using a 6 mol L−1 KOH + 0.2 mol L−1 Zn(OAc)2 solution as the electrolyte. CHI760 and CT2001A testing systems were used to test the performance of the ZABs assembled using Co SAs/NPs CNF and 20 wt% commercial Pt/C ZABs as air-electrode catalysts. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterizations of Co SAs/NPs CNF The synthesis of Co SAs/NPs CNF is depicted in Fig. 1(a) . The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1(b)) of Co SAs/NPs CNF reveals a nanoflower structure composed of ultrathin lamella (petals), with the lamella explored in further detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1(c)). Well-resolved lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.205 nm were observed by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 1(d)), corresponding to (111) facets of metallic Co NPs. In addition, many bright spots were seen in the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field atomic-resolution scanning transition electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of Co SAs/NPs CNF (Fig. 1(e)), corresponding to cobalt single atoms (Co SAs). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. 1(f)) mapping of C, N, and Co showed a uniform distribution of C, N, and Co atoms in the sample. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figs. 1(g)–(i)) of Co SAs/NPs CNF revealed that the ultrathin lamella had a height of 3.66 nm, consistent with SEM and TEM observations. Obviously, a distinct peak at ~25°, which is ascribed to the (002) facet of graphite, can be observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Co SAs/NPs CNF (Fig. 1(j)). Additionally, a weak peak at 47.3° arising from Co(111) crystalline plane can also be seen, suggesting that there possibly exists other types of Co-containing species in Co SAs/NPs CNF and the poor peak intensity is mainly due to the low loading of Co atoms. For the Co3O4/C reference sample, no Co metal peak was seen. Instead, the Co3O4 peaks were seen. Results indicate that the presence of HMT during the synthesis of Co SAs/NPs CNF was important for regulating the coordination of cobalt ions (i.e. for introducing surface nitrogen groups such as -NH2 in the CDs), thus enabling the creation of Co SAs and Co NPs during the subsequent pyrolysis step. Conversely, the presence of surface -OH and -COOH groups on CDs produced Co3O4 nanoparticles during the pyrolysis step. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) determined the Co content in Co SAs/NPs CNF to be ~2.9 wt%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the as-prepared CM-CDs to contain C, N, and O atoms (Fig. S1). The CM-CDs high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum contained three peaks at 398.8, 399.9, and 401.6 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, respectively. Pyrrolic-N comprised 70.6% of the nitrogen in the near surface region of the CM-CDs (Fig. S1(c)). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2(a)) showed that CM-CDs contained N–H/O–H/C–H bonds (all showing intense stretching vibrations in the 2800–3700 cm−1 region), along with intense C=O (~1750 cm−1) and C=N (~1400 cm−1) signals. C=C stretching modes of graphitic carbon in the CM-CDs core region also give rise to peaks in the 1200-1700 cm−1 region. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of CM-CDs (Fig. S2(b)) showed absorption bands at 201 and 330 nm, corresponding to π→π* transitions of aromatic C=C bonds and n→π* transitions of sp 2 C=O and C=N bonds, respectively. The results demonstrate that the CM-CDs were rich in surface -COOH/OH and -NH2 functional groups for the chelation of metalions, thus serving as a useful carbon precursor for the synthesis of Co SAs/NPs CNF. Nitrogen physisorption analysis (Fig. 2(a) ) revealed Co SAs/NPs CNF to have a high specific surface area (BET area 420.3 m2 g−1) with an average pore size of 6.67 nm (i.e. small mesopores). Both of these properties were expected to be conducive to proton transport during electrocatalytic reactions [15,32]. Raman spectrum shows that the intensity ratio of D-band (~1360 cm−1) to G-band (1570 cm−1) of Co SAs/NPs CNF is the smallest (0.87, Fig. S3), indicating that the carbon support of CoSAs/NPs CNF is highly graphitized. The 2D peak at 2702.0 cm−1 indicated the presence of thin graphite layers. XPS survey spectra ofCo SAs/NPs CNF showed the presence of C, N, O, and Co (Fig. S4), with the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) containing four peaks at 398.4, 399.7, 400.9, and 402.3 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, Co-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, respectively [33,34]. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2(c)) contained two sets of peaks, each set in a characteristic 2:1 are ratio. Peaks at 780.7 and 796.2 eV (Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2, respectively) were assigned to a cationic Co species (e.g. Co(II) in Co SAs, or CoO x formed by the surface oxidation of Co NPs with air exposure). The fact that no XPS peaks were seen due to Co metal (Co 2p 3/2 typically ~778.1 eV) is consistent with any metallic Co nanoparticles that have a thin oxide shell. The peaks as 785.8 and 802.8 eV (2:1 area ratio) are assigned to Co 2p shake-up satellites and are characteristic for cationic Co species. Fig. S5 shows that Co 2p XPS spectrum of the Co3O4/C reference sample, which contained unresolved contributions from Co2+/Co3+ (Co 2p 3/2 = 779.9 eV, Co 2p 1/2 = 795.4 eV) and associated shake-up satellite peaks (785.5 and 802.4 eV). Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to provide more detailed information about the coordination environment of cobalt in Co SAs/NPs CNF. As can be seen from the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectrum in Fig. 2(d), the absorption edge of Co SAs/NPs CNF is located between Co foil and Co phthalocyanine (Co Pc), indicating that the average valence state of Co in Co SAs/NPs CNF is at 0–2. The Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum in R space (Fig. 2(e)) for Co SAs/NPs CNF showed two clear peaks at 1.4 and 2.4 Å, attributed to Co–N/C and Co–Co first coordination shells. Again, the results provide strong evidence for discrete Co SAs and Co NPs in Co SAs/NPs CNF. EXAFS fitting results (Fig. 2(f)), based on a Co-N scattering path, established the coordination number of Co atoms in the single atom sites of Co SAs/NPs CNF to 4.3 (Table S1), consistent with a typical square planar Co-N4 coordination. Analysis of the wavelet transformed (WT) plots of Co SAs/NPs CNF, Co foil and Co Pc (Figs. 2(g)–(i)) indicated that Co Pc has the maximum k-space intensity at 3.5 Å−1, corresponding to the Co-N scattering contributions. The Co foil has the maximum k-space intensity at 6.6 Å−1, corresponding to the Co-Co scattering contributions. Co SAs/NPs CNF had maximum k-space intensities at both 3.5 and 6.6 Å−1 respectively, consistent with both Co–N and Co–Co scattering contributions. Results conclusively demonstrate that Co SAs/NPs CNF contained both Co-N4 single atom sites and metallic Co nanoparticles (the latter with a thin oxide shell as revealed by XPS). 3.2 The nanoflower formation mechanism during the synthesis of Co SAs/NPs CNF The structure of nanoflowers (NFs) supporting ultrathin conductive carbon lamella decorated with Co SAs and Co NPs was expected to be highly beneficial for ORR. Understanding the formation mechanism of the NFs from CM-CDs precursors was important for the future rational design of high-performance catalysts. SEM images of CM-SH (Figs. S6(a), (b)), revealed that ultrathin lamellae formed during the initial hydrothermal process involving citric acid and melamine, then aggregated to form a thick layered structure material during the high-temperature annealing process (Fig. S6(c)). Thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) investigated the chemical changes leading to the Co SAs/NPs CNF during the annealing step were investigated by TGA and DSC. The thermal analysis curves in Fig. S7(a) could be divided into three stages. In stage I (from 30 to 52 °C), the mass-loss rate was very high, likely due to the loss of physisorbed water. Stage II (52–400 °C) is associated with the functional groups (-COOH, -OH, -NH2) on the surface of the CM-CDs undergoing condensation reactions resulting in the desorption of H2O and NH3. In stage III above 400 °C, the mass-loss rate increases again due to pyrolysis of the cross-linked carbon network [29]. The gases released during stages II and III create a porous network structure in the final Co SAs/NPs CNF product. The FTIR spectra for the different samples (Fig. S7(b)) reveal that the CM-800 sample (prepared by direct annealing of the CM-CDs at 800 °C in Ar) had weaker peaks ~2800 and 1400 cm−1 compared to samples that underwent a second hydrothermal process, indicating fewer COOH and -NH2 groups were present. Based on the data above, we propose a mechanism for the formation of nanoflowers from CM-CDs building blocks during the hydrothermal steps and high-temperature pyrolysis (Fig. S7(c)). 3.3 Electrocatalytic performance for ORR The ORR performance of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst was measured in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH by a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) data for Co SAs/NPs CNF showed an obvious high current peak in an O2-saturated electrolyte (Fig. 3(a) ), associated with the oxygen reduction reaction, whilst no obvious reduction peaks when observed in an Ar-saturated electrolyte. Based on the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements in an alkaline electrolyte (Fig. 3(b)), the E 1/2 of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst was determined to be 0.83 V (vs. RHE), very close to that of a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.84 V, vs. RHE) under the same testing conditions. The limiting current density (j L) value of Co SAs/NPs CNF was 6.13 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V (vs. RHE), exceeding that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (5.29 mA cm−2). This was likely due to the 3D nanoflower structure of Co SAs/NPs CNF, which ensured good contact between active sites and the reactants during the catalytic reaction (i.e. improving proton transfer efficiency and facilitating the transport of O2 in the catalytic reaction) [15]. In stark contrast, the CV curve for CM-800 showed no obvious reduction peaks in O2-saturated electrolyte and the LSV curve has no obvious limiting current plateau (Fig. S8), indicating that CM-800 possessed very poor ORR performance. To further evaluate the kinetics of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst and Pt/C catalysts in ORR, Tafel slopes (Fig. 3(c)) were obtained from polarization curves of the catalysts. Co SAs/NPs CNF had a Tafel slope of 89.11 mV dec−1, lower than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (98.47 mV dec−1), demonstrating that Co SAs/NPs CNF exhibited faster ORR kinetics. According to the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation (Fig. 3(d)), the electron-transfer number (n) for Co SAs/NPs CNF during ORR was 3.90, suggesting a 4e− oxygen reduction pathway to generate OH− ions. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests (Fig. 3(e)) indicated that the yield of H2O2 over the voltage 0.20–0.80 V was < 5%, with n values of 3.92–3.97, very comparable to results of Pt/C electrode. Co SAs/NPs CNF thus selectively catalyzed a 4e− oxygen reduction pathway to generate OH−. To further explore the performance of the catalysts, we next tested the methanol tolerance of Co SAs/NPs CNF and Pt/C. The addition of methanol to the 0.1 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte did not significantly decrease the j value of Co SAs/NPs CNF, whereas the catalytic performance of Pt/C catalyst decreased significantly (Fig. 3(f)). After 5000 cycles, the E 1/2 of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst did not change (Fig. 3(g)). The i-t test data indicate that after 20 h, the performance of the catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte decreased by only 9.58%, whereas a 22.19% current loss was observed for the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 3(h)). Next, we tested the i-t stability of the Co SAs/NPs CNF and then subjected the tested samples to TEM characterization as shown in Fig. S9. After comparison, it was found that the morphology of the catalyst and the lattice fringes of Co NPs changed little before and after the test, which further proved the stability of the catalyst. Thiocyanate ions (SCN−) can poison the active sites of both Co SAs and Co NPs, whereas EDTA selectively coordinates with only Co SAs [25]. Therefore, we used 0.1 mol L−1 KOH electrolytes containing 10 mmol L−1 SCN− or 10 mmol L−1 EDTA to probe the active centers for ORR in the Co SAs/NPs CNF electrocatalyst. By observing the change of the current in the electrolyte containing 10 mmol L−1 EDTA/SCN− at a constant voltage of E 1/2 (0.83 V), it was found that the current decayed significantly (Fig. 3(i)). Therefore, it is concluded that both Co SAs and Co NPs act synergistically to enhance the ORR catalytic performance of Co SAs/NPs CNF. 3.4 Theoretical calculations To understand the catalytic ORR process over Co SAs/NPs CNF more accurately, DFT calculations were performed using Co SAs/NPs, Co SAs, and Co (111) model surfaces. Fig. 4(a)–(c) show the models created for the Co SAs/NPs, Co SAs, and Co (111), respectively, and the optimized adsorption geometries for *O2, *OOH, *O, and *OH (where * represents the active site) on each surface. We calculated the free energy (ΔG) of each step in the ORR process for Co SAs/NPs, Co SAs, and Co (111) at different over potentials (U = 0 and 1.23 V; Figs. 4(d), (e)). Fig. 4(d) shows that all the steps on the Co SAs/NPs and Co SAs surfaces were thermodynamically favorable, whereas the adsorption of *OH at U = 0 V on the Co (111) surface was a thermodynamically uphill process. Under the potential of 1.23 V, the adsorption process of *OOH was the RDS for Co SAs/NPs and Co SAs, with the step being endothermic with the free energy difference of 0.39 and 0.55 eV, respectively. The lower energy difference for the RDS on Co SAs/NPs implies better catalytic activity. For Co(111) at U = 1.23 V, the formation of *OH is the RDS with an energy barrier of 1.94 eV, indicating that the adsorption of *OH was too strong and would restrict the overall ORR. PDOS analyses (Fig. 4(f)) showed a large overlap between the Co-d states and O-p states of Co SAs/NPs and Co SAs in the energy range from -6 to 2 eV, with minimal overlap between the Co-d states and O-p states for the Co(111) surface. The overlap seen for Co SAs/NPs and Co SAs surfaces would be beneficial for the adsorption of oxygen intermediates during ORR. 3.5 Zinc-air Battery Performance We tested the overall LSV curves of Co SAs/NPs CNF and Pt/C. It can be seen that Co SAs/NPs CNF has a smaller voltage difference between OER and ORR (ΔE = E 10 - E 1/2) than commercial Pt/C (Fig. S10). Inspired by the smaller ΔE, we further assemble a ZAB device using Co SAs/NPs CNF (Fig. 5(a) ) to explore the practical utility of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst. The assembled ZAB had an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.431 V (Fig. 5(b)). The discharge curve shows that the power density of the Co SAs/NPs CNF-based ZAB was high (152.32 mW cm−2) with a current density of 227.00 mA cm−2, superior to that of the ZAB fabricated with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (118.73 mW cm−2 and 179.90 mA cm−2, respectively, Fig. 5(c)). Constant-current discharge curves show that under a constant current of 5 mA, the Co SAs/NPs CNF-based ZAB could be discharged for 47.63 h (Fig. S11). Therefore, this battery delivered a high specific capacity of 803.13 mAh gZn −1 (Fig. 5(d)) and a high energy density of 1000.58 mWh gZn −1 (Fig. 5(e)), attaining 93.69% of the theoretical energy density of a ZAB, superior to most other ZABs fabricated to date (Fig. 5(f) and Table S2) [35–45]. This superior performance derives from the 3D porous network of the Co SAs/NPs CNF ORR electrocatalyst used to prepare the air cathode. The porous electrocatalyst possesses abundant and stable gas-solid-liquid three-phase reaction interfaces, thereby improving the mass transfer of O2 to the catalytic active sites [16]. Charge-discharge cycle tests were also carried out for the ZAB fabricated using Co SAs/NPs CNF at a constant current of 5 mA cm−2 (discharge for 10 min and charge for 10 min). Negligible voltage gap change occurred over 1300 cycles, demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic stability of the assembled battery applying Co SAs/NPs CNF as the air-electrode catalyst (Fig. 5(g)). 4 Conclusions In this work, novel ORR catalysts were synthesized, comprising Co single atom sites and Co nanoparticles uniformly dispersed over 3D carbon nanoflowers (Co SAs/NPs CNF), by applying CDs as the building blocks. The unique 3D porous network structure of Co SAs/NPs CNF facilitated O2 and proton transport to active sites, together with the excellent electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst, and results in outstanding ORR performance (Tafel slope of 89.11 mV dec−1 and j L of 6.13 mA cm−2 in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH, superior to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst). Combined experimental and theoretical results suggest that a synergistic effect between the Co single atoms and Co nanoparticles facilitated the adsorption of *OOH in the rate-determining step of the ORR process. From this superior ORR performance, the Co SAs/NPs CNF-based ZAB presents a very high specific capacity (803.13 mAh gZn −1) and high energy density (1000.58 mWh gZn −1), and long-term cycle stability over 1300 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. This work draws attention to the interplay between metal single atom sites and metal nanoparticles in ORR catalysis, thus guiding the rational design of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts. The work also highlights the potential of carbon dots-based functional materials in renewable energy conversion/storage technologies.

        "dc:description": "The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinders the commercialization of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Manipulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to optimize the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates during the 4e− ORR offers a practical route toward improving ORR kinetics. Herein, we designed a novel ORR electrocatalyst containing Co single atoms and nanoparticles supported by carbon dots-derived carbon nanoflowers (Co SAs/NPs CNF). Co SAs/NPs CNF possessed a very high ORR activity (E 1/2 of the Co SAs/NPs CNF catalyst is 0.83 V (vs. RHE)), and outstanding catalytic performance and stability when used as the air-electrode catalyst in rechargeable ZABs (152.32 mW cm−2, 1000.58 mWh gZn −1, and over 1300 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm−2). The Co SAs and Co NPs cooperated to improve electron and proton transfer processes during ORR. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of adjacent Co NPs optimized the electronic structure of the isolated Co-N4 sites, significantly lowering the energy barriers for the rate-determining step in ORR (adsorption of *OOH) and thereby delivering outstanding ORR performance. This work reveals that the combination of supported single-atom sites and metal nanoparticles can be highly beneficial for ORR electrocatalysis, outperforming catalysts containing only Co SAs or Co NPs.",
