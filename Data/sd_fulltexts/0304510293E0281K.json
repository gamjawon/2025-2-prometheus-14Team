Part 10. Conversion of n-octane with supported Pt-Sn catalysts at 100 psig Dennis E. Sparks, Ram Srinivasan and Burtron H. Davis* Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA (Received January 24, 1993; accepted November 5, 1993) Abstract The n-octane conversion data at 100 psig conditions show that the presence of tin in a Pt-alumina catalyst increases conversion when a non-acidic support is used but decreases the activity of a catalyst with an acidic alumina support. The above observation applies for catalysts prepared by coimpregnation of Sn and Pt onto the support, but not for a catalyst prepared by coprecipitation of a tinaluminum oxide support which is then impregnated with Pt. For the catalysts prepared by coimpregnation, tin decreases the activity by poisoning acid sites that are needed for the bifunctional cyclization pathway but this is not the case for the coprecipitated catalyst for a similar Sn/Pt ratio. The role of tin in altering the activity and selectivity of Pt catalysts is correlated to catalyst characterization data. Key words: dehydrocyclization; octane; paraffin; platinum 1. Introduction The Pt-alumina catalyst was a major success in commercial operation following the introduction of this catalyst about 1950. It provided a formulation where the level of one function, the acidity, could be controlled during operation by the addition of acid mediating compounds such as carbon tetrachloride or water [ 1 ] . However, under severe operating conditions these catalysts need to be regenerated or replaced after a few months because of deactivation. This was a disadvantage since regeneration or replacement of these catalysts in a fixed bed operation required considerable operational down-time during the year. Thus, the introduction of a bimetallic Pt-Re-alumina catalyst which could operate for a year or longer without regeneration and was more selective for gasoline production provided another enormous advance in naphtha reforming [ 2 ] . However, the Pt-Re-alumina catalyst *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSD10304-5102(93)E0281-K 360 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 359-376 was too active during the period of initial use unless a special, and somewhat lengthy, breakin period was employed. During the initial period of use, one approach was to control the level of activity of the catalyst by adding a feed that contained higher than normal sulfur levels and a lower than normal start-up temperature. During operation, the sulfur level would be decreased gradually, and the reaction temperature increased, as the performance of the catalyst allowed. Other bimetallic formulations were introduced, such as Pt-Sn and Pt-Ir, and were utilized in some commercial operations [ 3 ] . However, for several years following its introduction the Pt-Re catalyst dominated in usage. On the other hand, the Pt-Sn system was extensively characterized even though it was not the dominant commercial catalyst [4] . The recent interest in low pressure reforming processes requires more frequent regeneration and has led to continuous regeneration processes [5]. This requires the use of a catalyst formulation that can be reintroduced into the reformer with little or no pretreatment following regeneration. This has renewed interest in the Pt-Sn alumina catalyst. In this paper we report data obtained at 100 psig as representative of the higher pressure region for a continuous regeneration reformer. This data complement those obtained at the lower pressures and reported in the preceding paper [ 6] . 2. Experimental The experimental details were given in previous publications [6,7]. The silica (Davison Chemical Co., 340 M2 1g) and acidic alumina (United Catalysts, Inc., 300 m2/g) supports were impregnated (or coimpregnated) with an acetone solution of chloroplatinic acid (or chloroplatinic acid and stannous chloride), then dried in air at 120 C, and calcined in air at 400 C. The tin-alumina support was prepared by precipitation from a solution containing tin chloride and aluminum chloride by addition of ammonia. Each catalyst contained 1.0 wt.% Pt and the appropriate amount of Sn to give the indicated Sn: Pt ratio. The catalyst was reduced at 500 C in-situ in a 17 in. X 1/2 in. i.d. stainless steel reactor. Conversions were effected at 100 psig, 8 :1 mole ratio of H2: n-octane, and 482 C. Conversions and product distributions were calculated from gas chromatographic data [ 6,7 ] . 3. Results 3.1. United Catalyst, Inc. (UCI) alumina catalyst The conversions of n-octane, including conversion to other C8-alkane isomers, are shown in Fig. 1 for various flow rates and for Sn: Pt ratios of 0: 1, 1: 1, 8:3 and 5:1 on the acidic UCI alumina support. It is apparent that the conversion at a given flow rate decreases with increasing Sn/Pt ratios. This is illustrated by plotting the conversion at a common flow rate, 2 mol/h/g of Pt, for catalysts with increasing Sn/Pt ratios (Fig. 2) ; these conversions were obtained by interpolating the best smooth curve to describe the conversion versus flow rate data for each catalyst shown in Fig. 1. The iso-CA alkanes/aromatic ratio appears to increase slowly as the Sn/Pt ratio is D.E.

Thus, in comparing the data in Fig. 3 at 40% n-octane conversion, the iso-CB-alkanes/aromatic ratios are essentially the same for Sn/Pt ratios of 0 and 1, and the amount of iso-C$-alkanes is about twice that of the aromatics for these two Sn:Pt ratios. For the catalyst with a Sn/Pt ratio of 2.67 the iso-C$-alkane/aromatic ratio is about 12, but decreases to about 7 as the Sn/Pt ratio is increased to 4. Thus, while the addition of tin decreases both the total conversion of n-octane and the production of aromatics (Fig. 4), it appears that the ratio of isomerization to aromatization passes through a maximum as the Sn/Pt ratio is increased. The C8-aromatic distributions (Fig. 5) are near those expected for a thermodynamic equilibrium distribution, and similar distributions are obtained for all of the tin containing catalysts that are based on the UCI alumina support. However, the amount of ethylbenzene (EB) and o-xylene (OX) are present in slightly larger amounts than expected for thermodynamic equilibrium; these are the aromatics that could be formed 362 D. E.

It therefore appears that these two aromatics (EB and OX) are formed directly from n-octane by six-carbon ring closure at low conversions and from a mixture of n- and iso-CH alkanes at higher conversions in addition to those that are formed in a bifunctional reaction pathway. This conclusion requires that the isomerization of aromatics is slow compared to the rate of CA-aromatics formation. The data in Fig. 6 indicate that aromatics production becomes appreciable only after about one-third of the n-octane has been converted. However, if the conversion is based on the total C8-alkanes instead of just n-octane conversion, C,-aromatics are primary products (Fig. 7). The addition of tin to the catalyst appears to alter the extent of formation of C,C4 gases with increasing n-octane conversion to a small extent, if at all (Fig. 8) .

The composition of methylheptanes shown in Fig. 9 cannot be obtained from only C5-ring closure of n-octane followed by ring hydrogenolysis; thus, with this catalyst a bifunctional process contributes to the production of methylheptanes. The presence of tin in the catalyst impacts the level of the alkylcyclopentanes in the liquid products. As shown in Fig. 10, the amount of alkylcyclopentanes remains essentially constant over much of the Cg alkane conversion range for the Pt-alumina catalyst without tin. Presumably this is a result of the removal of these intermediates by ring expansion to alkylcyclohexanes and subsequent dehydrogenation to aromatics at a rate that balances their formation by C5-ring cyclization. The addition of tin to give a Sn:Pt= 1 : 1 ratio reduces 364 D.E.

Silica catalyst For the silica supported catalysts, the conversion of n-octane decreases with the addition of tin to the catalyst as is illustrated by the production of aromatics (Fig. 11). This observation differs from the results with these catalysts at 1 atm pressure where the activity passed through a maximum with increasing Sn: Pt. The total amount of aromatic products increases with increasing n-octane conversion and the selectivity for aromatics production D.E.

The aromatics production is also the same whether the conversion is based on either n-octane or total C$-alkanes. The ratio of iso-C8 to aromatics decreases with increasing n-octane conversion, and appears to be independent of the Pt: Sn ratio (Fig. 13) . Furthermore, the ratio of iso-octanes /aromatics is nearly as large as obtained for the acidic catalyst. Thus, the ratio of iso-octanes/aromatics is what would be expected for an acidic support but the C8 aromatic distribution discussed below is not. The addition of tin to the Pt-Si02 catalyst causes a dramatic impact on the C8-aromatic product distribution. As shown in a previous paper [7], the dominant C8-aromatic is ethylbenzene for the Pt-Si02 catalyst, and the ratio ethylbenzene:o-xylene (EB:OX) is 366 D. E.

As shown in Fig. 14, the situation is reversed by the addition of tin so that the EB : OX ratio is 0.60 and, as shown in Table 1, the amount of the aromatics not allowed by direct six-carbon ring formation, m-xylene (MX) andp-xylene (PX), are formed to a lesser extent with the tin containing catalyst. Thus, the EB : OX ratio for the Pt-Si02 catalyst is 1.66 versus the ratio of 2 expected for a statistical distribution according to the possible cyclization pathways: n C, z C-C C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C I - i - i - - 1 3 _ ~ c D.E.

Likewise, the methylheptane distribution changes upon the addition of tin. It also appears that the distribution changes slightly with increasing n-octane conversion (e.g., Fig. 15); the data contained in Table 2 are the constant values that are attained at higher n-octane conversions. For the Pt-silica catalyst, 4-methylheptane and (3-ethylhexane + 3-methylheptane) were the major products, and these should be formed from the hydrogenolysis of the alkylcyclopentanes that could be formed directly from n-octane by CS-carbon ring formation. However, increasing the Sn : Pt ratio to 1 causes the methylheptane distributions to resemble those obtained with an acidic catalyst (Fig. 15). It was reported [ 7 ] earlier that the amount of alkylcyclopentane increased with increasing n-octane conversion for the Pt-Si02 catalyst. For the Pt-Sn-Si02 catalysts the amount of 368 D.E.

Since the alkylcyclopentanes do not convert directly to aromatics to a significant extent, it is concluded that the addition of tin to the Pt catalyst increases the rate of cyclopentane hydrogenolysis relative to aromatics formation. 3.3.

The production of aromatics for this catalyst series resembles the catalysts based on the UCI acidic support since the aromatics do not appear to be formed in an appreciable amount until about 30% of the n-octane has been converted to iso-CH alkanes.

Furthermore, the distributions are the ones expected for an acidic catalyst rather than the one obtained for the Pt catalyzed reaction when a non-acidic support was used. The decrease in the amount of alkylcyclopentanes in the products with increasing Sn/Pt ratio for this catalyst (Fig. 20) is similar to the change observed for the coimpregnated Sn/Pt on UCI alumina catalysts; that is, the addition of tin lowers the amount of alkylcyclopentanes in the product. There is little change in the Cg-aromatic distribution with n-octane conversion or with reaction time for this catalyst series. However, the addition of tin to the alumina support appears to alter the C,-aromatic distribution. The data indicate that there is a decrease in the amount of ethylbenzene, and a corresponding increase in the amount of m- and p-xylenes, when tin is incorporated (Table 1). However, it does not appear that there is a significant difference between the C8-aromatic distributions for the two catalysts with Sn : Pt ratios of 1 or 3. 4. Discussion The activity of the non-acidic catalyst (based on silica) does not follow the same trend with changes in the Sn : Pt ratio at 100 psig conditions as it did at atmospheric pressure. At 1 atm pressure the activity initially increased and then underwent a decrease [ 6,8 ] . If there is an increase in activity at 100 psig as the Sn : Pt ratio increases, it must occur at a Sn : Pt ratio of less than 1 since the activity of the Sn:Pt=1:1 was lower than the Pt catalyst without Sn. The aromatics for the Sn : Pt= 0 :1 and 1:1 catalysts based on the silica support were predominantly those expected for direct six-carbon ring formation although the ratio of ethylbenzene to o-xylene was different when tin was present. Thus, cyclization produced a distribution that is close to the one expected for a statistical distribution (EB :OX= 2) for 372 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 359-376 the catalyst that contains only Pt but this ratio was much smaller (EB : OX = 0.64) for the Sn: Pt=1: 1 catalyst. Thus, the results indicate that tin alters the cyclization pathway to favor the aromatic that involves breaking two of the weaker secondary C-H bonds in noctane rather than a stronger primary C-H bond to form EB, and this may be viewed to be due to alteration of the electron deficiency (d-holes) of the Pt. The change in aromatic distribution as tin is added to the catalyst is strong evidence to support the view that there is a direct interaction between Pt and Sn. This view is supported by the characterization data [9-17] which showed that formation of a Pt-Sn=1:1 alloy was essentially complete for the Pt: Sn =1:1 formulation on the silica support. The common view for the formation of iso-alkanes from n-alkanes is that it is a result of a bifunctional pathway where the metal function catalyzes hydrogenation/ dehydrogenation reactions and that the acid function is responsible for the isomerization of the n-alkene to iso-alkenes. While the data in Table 2 indicate that there may be differences in the isooctane products obtained for the Pt and Pt-Sn catalyst, the isomers are sufficiently close to the equilibrium compositions that a valid decision concerning this point is not possible. The data for the conversion of n-octane with the non-acidic Pt catalyst show that isomerization of n-alkanes to iso-alkanes does not require a bifunctional mechanism; formation of cyclopentanes and their subsequent hydrogenolysis produce iso-alkanes more rapidly than aromatics are formed by metal catalyzed dehydrocyclization. Gault and coworkers, e.g., [ 18,19], made extensive studies of the isomerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes with metal catalysts. In most instances, the studies by Gault and numerous other investigators have been conducted at low temperatures (300 C or lower). The isomerization reaction is considered to occur via two reaction pathways: a bond-shift mechanism and a cyclic mechanism. These isomerization schemes are outlined in Scheme 1 below for labeled hydrocarbons ( indicates a '3C label). These pathways require only a metal function. One or both of these pathways are likely to be responsible for the isom- Ring MethylShift Methyl Shift Opening ~(/y\\)ads - '- (onads-s(/~^)ads Cyclic Mechanism Methyl Shift VYN ads Scheme I. D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 359-376 373 erizations observed for Pt on non-acidic supports. For the bifunctional catalysts, isomerization by acid catalysis must dominate. Furthermore, the acid catalyzed pathway is more selective since essentially an equilibrium octane composition is obtained with very little gaseous products or aromatics. This is not the case for the monofunctional Pt catalysts. Isomerization appears to parallel the formation of aromatics and gaseous products. While bond shift mechanisms cannot be eliminated, we prefer to view the dominant pathway as parallel cyclization pathways as shown in Scheme 2. The scheme shows that the difference between isomerization and aromatization depends upon the cyclic intermediate; i.e., whether a five- or six-carbon ring is formed. The alkane isomers produced during the conversion of n-octane [ 20,21 ] . For the acidic UCI alumina based catalyst series, there are some similarities between the activity and selectivity patterns obtained at 1 atm [7] and those at 100 psig. First, as the amount of tin in the catalyst increases, initially the activity declines just as was observed at atmospheric pressure. However, further increases in the Sn/Pt ratio do not produce a subsequent increase in the activity at the 100 psig conditions as was observed at 1 atm. Characterization data for the Pt-Sn catalysts prepared by coimpregnation onto the supports, including the UCI alumina, show that the extent of Sn/Pt alloy formation increases with increases in the Sn/Pt ratio. A measure of the extent of Sn/Pt alloy formation for these catalysts is presented in Fig. 21 for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [ 13-15], Xray diffraction (XRD) [9-11 ] and M6ssbauer spectroscopy [ 12] characterization data. The XPS data are based on the assumption that all Pt is reduced to Pt' and that all Sn detected is present as Sn : Pt = l : l alloy; this assumption is not valid for the surface composition at higher Sn/Pt ratios since the calculated percentage Pt-Sn alloy exceeds 100%, which is not possible. The XRD data is based upon the assumption that the highest area of the 100% peak corresponds to all Pt being present as Sn : Pt=1:1 alloy. It appears that essentially all of the Pt has been converted to the alloy only as the Sn: Pt ratio approaches 3 to 5, depending upon the support and its surface area. Thus, the activity for n-octane dehydrocyclization decreases with increasing Sn/Pt ratios (Fig. 2) while the fraction of Pt that is present in an alloy form increases with increasing Sn/Pt ratios for a high surface area alumina support. This is interpreted as being due to the tin added by impregnation serving two functions: (1) the formation of Pt/ Sn alloy following reduction of a portion of the tin to Sn and (2) poisoning of acid sites by some fraction of the tin that does not form an alloy. Thus, the initial role of tin in the high surface area alumina supported Sn/Pt catalysts is to decrease alkane conversion by removing acid sites. c3 - Iso-octaves C.- ~~c C 1(aj~ ethylbenzene PIUS ortho-yiene CC [C Scheme2. 374 D.E.

A) on UCI alumina). In agreement with earlier studies with a naphtha feed [ 18 ] , it was observed that the increase in dehydrocyclization activity due to alloy formation was not observed at 400 psig, but was observed at 1 atm conditions [8]. A schematic of the characterization and activity for alumina supported Sn-Pt catalysts prepared by coimpregnation is shown in Fig. 22. For a similar surface area, the extent of alloy formation is similar for the acid and non-acidic support. For a 200 m2/g alumina, a ratio of Sn/Pt of about 5 is required to attain the highest fraction of alloy (curve A, Fig. 22). For the Sn/Pt-non-acidic catalyst at 1 atm conditions, the conversion increases with increasing Sn/Pt loading to attain a maximum activity at Sn: Pt about 4 (curve B, Fig. 22); this is about the same Sn/Pt ratio where essentially all of the Pt is observed to be in the Sn: Pt= 1 form. Further increases in the Sn/Pt ratio above about 4 results in a decline in catalyst activity, presumably by increasing the surface coverage of the Sn/Pt alloy particles by Sn . For the acidic alumina supported Sn/Pt catalyst at 1 atm reaction conditions there is an initial decrease in activity (curve C, Fig. 22) followed by an activity pattern for Sn/Pt ratios that parallels those of the catalysts based on the nonacidic alumina support. Thus, tin appears to play two roles when added to an acidic alumina support: at low loading the tin functions remove acid sites and thereby eliminate the bifunctional pathways, and with higher tin loadings the activity changes are due to alloy formation that produces an activity pattern that parallels the non-acidic alumina based Sn/ D.E.

Pt catalysts. The activity for higher pressure operations for the catalyst series based upon acidic alumina shows a rapid decline in conversion with initial Sn/Pt ratio increases and then attains a region of essentially constant activity with further Sn/Pt increases (curve D, Fig. 22). As stated above, the rapid decline in activity at the higher pressure conditions is apparently due to elimination of the bifunctional reaction pathway. The absence of an increase in activity with further increase in Sn/Pt ratios implies that tin is reduced to a greater extent while operating at the 100 psig conditions than at 1 atm. Tin appears to play a role in the conversion of n-octane through the CS-cycloalkane intermediates. The iso-CB-alkane/aromatic ratio does not strongly depend on the Sn:Pt ratio for either the acidic or non-acidic supported catalysts. However, the amount of alkyl substituted CS-cycloalkanes in the products for a given n-octane conversion level is lower for the Sn /Pt catalyst than for a similar catalyst with Pt only. This indicates that the presence of tin enhances the activity for converting the cyclopentanes to alkanes. Tin in the coprecipitated catalyst impacts catalyst performance differently than it does when it is coimpregnated together with Pt onto the acidic alumina support. The activity for n-octane conversion did not change as the Sri: Pt ratios were varied from 0 to 3. However, there was a change in the Cs-aromatic distribution as tin was added to the catalyst. This indicates that tin does alter the metallic character of the supported Pt. Characterization data indicated that very little of the Pt is present as alloy even for a catalyst that has a bulk composition of Sri: Pt = 3 :1; this is in contrast to the Sn : Pt = 3 :1 catalyst prepared by coimpregnation onto a similar surface area alumina [9-17] . Surface analysis indicate that tin is concentrated on the surface of a coimpregnated catalyst but that little tin is present on the surface of a material with a similar Sri: Pt composition when tin is added by coprecipi- 376 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 359-376 tation with alumina [ 11 ] . The n-octane conversion data likewise indicate that activity due to acidity is not eliminated for the coprecipitated catalyst even for the Sn : Pt= 3 : I ratio. It does not appear that the primary role of tin in the Pt on coprecipitated tin-alumina is to form an alloy; thus, it is believed that tin functions to help maintain dispersion of the Pt and in this way to aid in maintaining the high activity for longer periods than for a similar Ptalumina catalyst. The present data indicate that tin may play several roles in the catalytic activity and the selectivity characteristics. Furthermore, the role of tin, for a given bulk Sn/Pt ratio, is different for a catalyst prepared by coimpregnation than by impregnation of a tin-alumina with Pt. Thus, it is not possible to assign a unique role for tin in modifying the characteristics of Pt-alumina for alkane dehydrocyclization. 5. References [ I ] V.

The n-octane conversion data at 100 psig conditions show that the presence of tin in a Pt-alumina catalyst increases conversion when a non-acidic support is used but decreases the activity of a catalyst with an acidic alumina support. The above observation applies for catalysts prepared by coimpregnation of Sn and Pt onto the support, but not for a catalyst prepared by coprecipitation of a tin-aluminum oxide support which is then impregnated with Pt. For the catalysts prepared by coimpregnation, tin decreases the activity by poisoning acid sites that are needed for the bifunctional cyclization pathway but this is not the case for the coprecipitated catalyst for a similar Sn/Pt ratio.
