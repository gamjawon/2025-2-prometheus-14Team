Tel.: +86 22 60602936. Graphical abstract Microporous zeolite supported catalysts were prepared by loading Cr(acac)3 and N-isopropyl bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (PNP) onto methylaluminoxane (MAO)-modified HZSM-5, HY, and NaY zeolites to investigate the influence of supported patterns and confinement effect on tetramerization reaction of ethylene. Characterization data and experimental results revealed that the chromium atoms were immobilized effectively on the three zeolites in different supported patterns, which affected the catalytic performance in ethylene tetramerization reactions. The chromium active sites were generated in situ by using MAO as the activator. The highest activity and selectivity toward 1-octene were provided by the NaY-supported catalyst; these values were higher than those of homogeneous Cr(acac)3/PNP. The new mode of confinement, consisting of confined PNP and supported Cr(acac)3 within the supercage of NaY zeolite, is presented on the NaY-supported catalyst and it effectively increases the activity and selectivity toward 1-octene in ethylene tetramerization. Keywords Ethylene tetramerization Supported catalyst Microporous zeolite Confinement 1 Introduction 1-Octene is an important co-monomer in the production of linear low-density polyethylene; on the industrial scale, it is obtained mainly through the oligomerization of ethylene. Conventional oligomerization of ethylene produces a broad range of linear α-olefins [1], which require purification through fractional distillation. The continually increasing demand for 1-octene has lead to interest in more-selective oligomerization technologies. Employing chromium-based catalysts with diphosphinoamine (PNP) ligands, Sasol first reported in 2004 that ethylene oligomerization could be performed with selectivity toward 1-octene of up to 70% [2]. Since then, many efforts have been made to optimize the catalytic performance [3–8]. According to the tetramerization mechanism proposed by Overett [9], the formation and stability of the metallacyclononane intermediate, which determines the production of 1-octene, are affected by the environment around the chromium active site. Thus, the immobilization or confinement of chromium-based catalysts would be expected as possible method to adjust the production of 1-octene. Toulhoat and co-authors used grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the effect of confinement within zeolitic structures on the activity and selectivity of a Ti-based catalyst for ethylene oligomerization; they predicted that a zeolite having a pore size of approximately 1nm would increase the production of 1-octene [10]. In a subsequent patent, Toulhoat claimed that adding a zeolite into the reaction system could increase the production of 1-octene [11]. Because the homogeneous catalyst prefers to be dissolved in the solvent, rather that to be adsorbed within the zeolite, hence, the oligomerization occurs primarily in the solvent, and the confinement effect is relatively weak. Immobilization of the active sites within the zeolite may improve the confinement effect. However, the confinement effect within the microporous zeolite for the chromium acetylacetonate [Cr(acac)3]/PNP system could not be predicted because the macromolecular activator, methylaluminoxane (MAO), has a kinetic diameter of greater than 1nm [12]. To the best of our knowledge, confinement effects on supported catalysts for ethylene tetramerization have not been reported previously. Zeolites are microporous materials known for their surface acidity, precisely and uniformly sized pore systems, chemical and thermal stability, and efficiency as catalyst supports in metallocene-catalyzed polymerizations of olefins [13,14] and the nickel-catalyzed oligomerization of ethylene [15]. Moreover, zeolite-supported catalysts have advantages over catalysts in solution that arise from both the shape-selectivity of the zeolite itself and the ready separability of the heterogeneous catalyst. In this present study, we prepared three different catalysts by supporting Cr(acac)3/PNP on MAO-modified versions of the zeolites HZSM-5, HY and NaY. We determined the supported patterns on the three kinds of zeolites and investigated their influence on the reaction performance in ethylene tetramerization. Herein, we discuss the confinement effects within these three zeolite-supported catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All the chemicals were manipulated under inert atmospheres using Schlenk techniques. Isopropylamine and chromium acetylacetonate [Cr(acac)3] were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Zeolites (HZSM-5: SiO2/Al2O3 =150; HY: SiO2/Al2O3 =4.9; NaY: SiO2/Al2O3 =4.9) were purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co. A solution of MAO in toluene (1.4molL−1) was purchased from Albemarle. Polymerization-grade ethylene was obtained from Tianjin Summit Specialty Gases Co. Cyclohexane and toluene were dried and degassed prior to use. All other chemicals were obtained commercially and used as received. 2.2 Supported catalysts N-isopropyl bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (PNP) was synthesized through the reaction between isopropylamine and diphenylphosphine chloride, according to the method described in the literature [2]. All zeolites were activated at 600°C for 8h and then stored in glove box until required. HZSM-5 (1g) was charged in a flask; the sealed flask was removed from glove box. Toluene (10mL) and MAO (5mL) were added sequentially to the flask while stirring (magnetic stirrer) and then maintained at 30°C for 12h. The solid was washed with toluene (3×10mL) to give the MAO-modified HZSM-5. A solution of Cr(acac)3 (0.211g, 0.600mmol) and PNP (0.261g, 0.610mmol) in toluene (10mL) was added to the flask, which was then heated at 50°C for 12h. The supported catalyst was washed with toluene (3×10mL) and then dried under vacuum at 50°C to give a light-green powder (ZSMCr). The HY-supported Cr(acac)3/PNP (HYCr) and NaY-supported Cr(acac)3/PNP (NaYCr) were obtained using similar processes. The MAO-modified NaY (0.54g) was charged in a flask and suspended in toluene (5mL) and then a solution of Cr(acac)3 (0.105g, 0.300mmol) in toluene (5mL) was added and the mixture heated at 50°C for 12h. The supported catalyst was washed with toluene (3×5mL) and dried under vacuum at 50°C to give Cr-NaY (Cr(acac)3 was only supported on MAO-modified NaY without PNP). 2.3 Characterization of the supports and catalysts The chromium contents of the zeolite-supported catalysts were determined through atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) using an AA-6800 atomic absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a heated graphite tube atomizer. A hollow cathode lamp was used as the radiation source for Cr (wavelength: 357.8nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU1510 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 5kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) of the supported catalysts was performed using a Hitachi S-4800 apparatus. The sample was prepared using an ultramicrotome apparatus. Under liquid N2 temperature, the sample was cut off using a diamond knife from a block of cured epoxy resin, where the supported catalyst was dispersed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku RINT2000 diffractometer operated at 40kV and 40mA, using CuKα radiation. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at −196°C using a Quantachrome autosorb (iQ) apparatus. Samples were first degassed at 300°C for 4h (supports) or at 60°C for 12h (supported catalysts). Specific surface areas (S BET) were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (P/P 0 =0.05–0.35). Pore diameters (D P) were calculated using the Saito–Foley (SF) method). The total pore volume (V P) was determined from the adsorption volume at a value of P/P 0 of 0.995. Micropore surface areas (S micro) and volumes (V micro) were calculated using the t-plot method. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a PTC-10A TG-DTA system (Rigaku) operated at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 up to 700°C under a flow of N2 (60mLmin−1). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument. The samples of the support were loaded onto KBr discs. The supported catalysts were dispersed in paraffin oil and coated between two KBr discs in a glove box; the two KBr discs were pressed together tightly to prevent contact with air. The background of KBr was subtracted prior to loading of the samples. 2.4 Leaching tests Leaching tests were performed to determinate whether the chromium on the catalyst can be leached in the same condition with the oligomerization reaction system in the absent of ethylene. Under N2, the supported catalyst (0.02g) was suspended in a flask containing cyclohexane (6mL) and then a solution of MAO (0.2mL) was added. The flask was maintained at 50°C for 30min and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of a solution of HCl in EtOH (10wt.%). The slurry was filtered and the eluent was concentrated to dryness. Distilled water was added to the residue up to a volume of 10mL. The leaching of chromium was calculated according to the content of chromium in the eluent. 2.5 Ethylene tetramerization Ethylene tetramerization was performed in a 0.5-L autoclave. After evacuation and flushing with N2 (three times) and then ethylene (twice), the autoclave was charged with cyclohexane (0.1L), which was stirred mechanically under ambient ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was reached, MAO and a supported catalyst (ZSMCr, HYCr, NaYCr, or a mixture of Cr-NaY and PNP) suspended in cyclohexane (5mL) were injected into the reactor. Typically, after 30min the mixture was cooled rapidly to 20°C and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of a solution of HCl in EtOH (10wt.%). The catalyst activity was calculated from the increase in product mass. A small amount of product was filtered and then the filtrate was washed with deionized water to remove the EtOH, catalyst, MAO, and HCl. The product was dried (anhydrous Na2SO4) and then analyzed through gas chromatography (GC) using a HP-7890 instrument equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30m×0.25mm). The sample was maintained at 35°C for 10min, heated at 10°Cmin−1 until the temperature reached 280°C, and then maintained at that temperature for 10min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Supported patterns of zeolite-supported catalysts Zeolites bear surface silinol (SiOH) groups, which can react as grafting sites with chromium based catalyst, causing decrease of catalytic activity [16]. MAO can react with silinol to shield hydroxyl and does not introduce extra catalyst poisons, so MAO is widely used to prepare supported metallocene and other supported catalyst [17–19]. Furthermore, MAO-pretreated support can provide new grafting sites, which can form ionic linkage with chromium catalyst, increasing the interaction between the support and chromium and avoiding leached out of chromium supported at the reaction system [19]. In addition, it is expect that use of MAO in the preparation can decrease the charged amount of MAO in the oligomerization reaction. Table 1 presents the properties of the zeolites and the zeolite-supported catalysts. Obvious differences exist between the chromium contents of ZSMCr and HYCr, which have the same cations but different pore structures, as well as between HYCr and NaYCr, which have similar pore structures but different cations, even though they were all charged with the same amount of chromium. These differences suggest that the loading of chromium was affected by multiple factors and that the supporting patterns on the three zeolites were different. For the three zeolite-supported catalysts, the contents of leached chromium, corresponding to 1.9–5.8% of the supported chromium content, were very low. Because leaching in these supported systems was practically negligible, the supported catalysts would presumably catalyze the oligomerization reaction as heterogeneous catalysts, rather than as homogeneous catalysts. The different supported patterns on the three zeolites were also evident from the different changes in the pore structures of the zeolites. For ZSMCr, the proportional decreases in the values of S BET, S micro, and V micro suggested that the loading process mainly filled the micropores or supported the outside surface to block the mouths of the pores of the zeolite. Relative to its support, HYCr featured decreases in its values of S micro, V micro, external surface area, and external volume of approximately 75, 74, 40, and 50%, respectively, accompanied by almost no change in pore size; these finding suggested that Cr(acac)3 and PNP were loaded mainly within the micropores, while smaller particles had aggregated to form bigger particles that decreased the external surface area. The change in pore structure of NaYCr was different than those of ZSMCr and HYCr; it featured dramatic decreases in the values of S micro and V micro, accompanied by increases in the external surface area and the pore size, suggesting that the loading occurred mainly within the micropores and that the particles of the support had broken to form smaller particles. Fig. 1 displays the morphologies of the zeolites and the zeolite-supported catalysts. After supporting Cr(acac)3/PNP, different changes in morphology occurred for the three zeolites. The particles of HZSM-5, which has a regular square structure, had broken into smaller particles, followed by formation of rose-shaped structures, with the loadings supported mainly on the surface of the HZSM-5 crystals. The smaller particles of HY had combined to form rose-shaped larger particles. For the NaY-supported catalyst, the original particles had broken and recombined to form a large particle cluster. According to the morphologies of the zeolites and the zeolite-supported catalysts, the supported patterns of the Cr(acac)3/PNP on the three zeolites were different and the original particle structures of the zeolites were destroyed during the supporting process. For the three zeolite-supported catalysts, the amounts of chromium on their cross sections were significantly different, indicating that the distribution of chromium was not uniform. It is easy to support on the outer surface of the primary particles. Accordingly, we suspected that the catalytic activities on the different sections of the supported catalysts would be different. Notably, the amount of chromium increased upon increasing the amount of aluminum on the three catalysts, such that it became far larger than amount of aluminum in the framework of the zeolites, suggesting that the loading of chromium was related to the content of supported aluminum. XRD patterns of the zeolites and the zeolite-supported catalysts were presented in Fig. S1. After the Cr(acac)3/PNP had been supported on HZSM-5 and HY, the crystal structures of these zeolites were maintained, as evidenced by the absence of changes in diffracted angles or intensities. Relative to NaY, the diffracted angles of NaYCr were unchanged, indicating that the crystal structure was maintained, but obvious changes in the diffracted intensities at 11.8 and 15.56° revealed that the lattice structure had changed at the {311} and {331} crystal planes [20]; thus, the framework of NaY had changed slightly, but not enough to destroy the crystal structure. We used TGA to investigate the interactions between the zeolites and Cr(acac)3/PNP. Fig. 2 displays the thermograms of Cr(acac)3/PNP and of the three zeolite-supported catalysts. For Cr(acac)3/PNP (1:1 mixture), the endothermic peak at 124°C without weight loss suggests that this temperature is the melting point of PNP. A weight loss of 64.4% at 308°C was caused by the decomposition of PNP. The weight losses at 503 and 542°C represent the decomposition of Cr(acac)3, although these temperatures are higher than the decomposition temperature of pure Cr(acac)3 [21]. We attribute the endothermic peak for ZSMCr at 100°C to the melting of PNP, the exothermic peaks at 371°C to the decomposition of PNP and the exothermic peaks at 432 and 531°C to the decompositions of Cr(acac)3; that is, the decomposition temperatures of Cr(acac)3 and PNP had been changed. These temperature changes reveal the existence of weak interactions between Cr(acac)3/PNP and HZSM-5. The existence of three decomposition peaks, similar to the mixture of Cr(acac)3 and PNP, suggests that the complex between Cr(acac)3 and PNP had not formed. In the TGA trace for HYCr, only one broad peak appeared at 571°C, representing a complex formed between Cr(acac)3 and PNP; its elevated decomposition temperature suggests that a strong interaction exists between the complex and HY. We attribute the obvious exothermic peak at 314°C in the TGA trace of NaYCr to the decomposition of PNP, which was confined within the supercage of NaY; the broad, weak peak at 581°C reveals that interactions existed between Cr(acac)3 and NaY. Next, we used FTIR spectroscopy to characterize the interactions between Cr(acac)3/PNP and the support (Fig. S2). Relative to the spectra of their supports, the absence of the deformation vibrations of the OH groups at 1633, 1633, and 1637cm−1 in the spectra of ZSMCr, HYCr, and NaYCr suggest that SiOH units behaved as the supporting sites [22]. Relative to the spectrum of pure Cr(acac)3, the asymmetrical CC stretching vibrations shifted from 1518cm−1 to 1533, 1534, and 1533cm−1 for ZSMCr, HYCr, and NaYCr, respectively [21]. Such obvious shifts implied that the Cr(acac)3 units were already supported on the zeolites. After supporting Cr(acac)3 on HZSM-5 and HY, slight shifts of absorption peaks of HZSM-5 and HY presented in Fig. S2 reveal that the support of Cr(acac)3 has little effect on the structures of HZSM-5 and HY. Relative to the signals in the FTIR spectrum of NaY, the vibrations of the inner SiO tetrahedra of NaYCr shifted from 1007 and 708cm−1 to 984 and 700cm−1, respectively, and the bending vibration of SiO bonds shifted from 457 to 468cm−1; these obvious shifts suggest changes in the structure of the inner SiO tetrahedra. In terms of the external framework of NaYCr, the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the SiO bonds had shifted from 1159 and 792cm−1 to 1155 and 786cm−1, respectively, and the vibration of the dicyclo framework had shifted from 577 to 582cm−1, revealing no change in the external framework. According to the XRD, TGA, and FTIR spectroscopic data, supporting the Cr(acac)3/PNP catalysts had various effects that depended on the structures of the three zeolites. We suspect that the different pore sizes and cations of these zeolites were key factors affecting the supported mechanism, further details of which will be investigated in future. 3.2 Reaction performance and confinement effect Table 2 presents the reactivities and product oligomer distributions of Cr(acac)3/PNP and the zeolite-supported Cr-based catalysts. Relative to Cr(acac)3/PNP, the activities and selectivities of ZSMCr and HYCr toward 1-octene were obviously lower, whereas their selectivities toward higher carbon olefins had increased, implying that these catalysts do not favor the production of 1-octene. The catalyst NaYCr exhibited activity similar to those of Cr(acac)3/PNP, but higher selectivity toward 1-octene; thus, Cr(acac)3/PNP supported on NaY is a favorable material for the production of the tetramer. When MAO was absent from the reaction system, the NaYCr catalyst had very low activity (entry 6), suggesting that the active sites were generated in situ mainly upon the MAO units (cf. entries 3–5). Thus, MAO, which was added during the preparation of the supported catalyst, functioned mainly as the anchor for Cr(acac)3/PNP, not as an activator. For the homogeneous and zeolite-supported Cr-based catalysts, the activities decreased upon increasing the temperature because of the decreased concentration of ethylene and because of deactivation resulting from the association of two Cr atoms [23]. Increased temperatures accelerated chain transfer, particularly β-hydride elimination, to a greater degree than chain propagation, thereby forming more low-molecular-weight oligomers on the homogeneous and zeolite-supported catalysts. Notably, the selectivities toward 1-octene over HYCr and NaYCr were both approximately 20% higher than those toward 1-hexene; in contrast, the selectivity toward 1-octene was 10% lower than that toward 1-hexene over Cr(acac)3/PNP at 80°C. These variations suggest that the presence of the supporting material effectively inhibited β-hydride elimination, thereby decreasing the rate of diminished selectivity toward 1-octene, although it did not increase the tolerance of the catalyst to high temperatures. The different reaction performances over the three supported catalysts were closely related to the supported patterns on the three zeolites. For the HZSM-5 support, the Cr(acac)3 and PNP units, as a mixture, were supported mainly on the surface and within the micropores (see Table 1). The interaction between Cr(acac)3/PNP and this support was weak (see Fig. 2) and because Cr(acac)3 was not stabilized by PNP [24], the chromium(III) centers were readily deactivated. Furthermore, activation of Cr atoms located within this zeolite was poor because the kinetic diameter of MAO is far larger than the pore size of HZSM-5 [12]. In addition, the steric bulk of the pore wall of the zeolite inhibited monomer coordination. Taken together, these features resulted in the activity and selectivity of ZSMCr toward 1-octene both decreased, relative to those of homogeneous Cr(acac)3/PNP. The complex between Cr(acac)3 and PNP, formed in the presence of MAO [24], was loaded within the pores of HY, making it difficult for activation by MAO. At the same time, the pore wall of HY may have inhibited ethylene coordination. Although the transfer of ethylene is not a key factor influencing the decreased selectivity toward 1-octene, more-difficult egress of 1-octene from the pores would decrease its selectivity through the greater production of higher olefins. For NaYCr, the PNP units confined within the supercage of NaY could adequately coordinate to Cr atoms to form stable complexes after MAO had activated the Cr active sites. The selectivity toward 1-octene was slightly higher than that of homogeneous Cr(acac)3/PNP, because of the confinement effect [10]. In contrast, Cr-NaY in the presence of 1.1 equivalents of PNP exhibited very low activity and a broad product distribution (entry 7). Increasing of the number of equivalents of PNP to 4.0 did not have any obvious effects on the activity or the selectivity toward 1-octene (entry 8). This behavior suggests that the PNP units in the solvent had difficulty entering the pores of the catalyst to stabilize the Cr active sites located within the supercage [24] and that the Cr atoms on the NaY zeolite were not readily washed away by the MAO units to coordinate with PNP in the solvent. For NaYCr, if the MAO units washed the PNP units away from the supported catalyst, the PNP had difficultly coordinating to the Cr atoms again to maintain high activity and selectivity. Thus, this behavior confirms that the PNP units were confined within the supercage of NaY and were not washed out by the MAO. When we added the NaY zeolite to the Cr(acac)3/PNP catalyst system, the activity and the selectivity toward 1-octene remained almost constant, implying a very weak confinement effect (entry 9). Although the activity and the selectivity of NaYCr toward 1-octene had both increased slightly, relative to those of Cr(acac)3/PNP, it is notable that they were obviously higher than those of ZSMCr and HYCr, which were supported, but not confined, catalysts. Thus, the confinement effect clearly existed for NaYCr. Unlike the reaction system reported in the literature (a free Ti-based catalyst in the presence of NaY) [11], supported catalysts can ensure that catalytic reactions occur within the pores, although Cr atoms within small pores have difficulty being activated by MAO. The differences in catalyst structure and activation between the present catalysts and the Ti-based catalyst system lead to differences in their activities and selectivities. We will investigate the influence of the mode of activation of NaYCr on the confinement effect in a future study. The influences of the reaction condition on catalytic reactivity over NaYCr were presented in Table 3 . The catalytic activity was stable during initial 30min reaction periods, and decreased thereafter due to catalyst inactiveness and/or blocking active sites with produced polyethylene. The selectivity was invariable over reaction periods. The catalytic activity increased initially with temperature and reached a maximum at 50°C, and then decreased from 50 to 80°C. The elevated temperature was expected to result in overall higher propagation and transfer rates of ethylene. Unfortunately, the higher temperature also decreased ethylene solubility in solvent and increased deactivation rate of active sites. It is combination of these effects that is likely to account for the observed temperature dependence of the activity. The selectivity toward 1-octene was decreased with the increase of reaction temperature, and selectivity toward 1-hexene displayed an increasing trend. It indicates that the rate of chain transfer, particularly β–H elimination, increases more than the rate of propagation, which is expected to afford lower molecular weight oligomer [3]. Improving ethylene pressure dramatically increased catalytic activity and selectivity toward 1-octene. This result shows that the elevated pressure leads to an increase of ethylene solubility, which results in the increase of chain propagation rate and thus induces the increase of catalytic activity and selectivity toward 1-octene [23]. The catalytic activity and selectivity toward 1-octene first increased with Al/Cr ratio and decreased thereafter. The activity and selectivity toward 1-octene reached a maximum at Al/Cr ratio of 300. Similar result has been presented in our previous work [7]. The MAO can activate chromium sites to form appropriate activated state, but excess amount of MAO may interfere with the formation of the active chromium species by the over-reduction of chromium species. 4 Conclusion Cr(acac)3/PNP catalysts supported on MAO-modified HZSM-5, HY, and NaY zeolites exhibit obviously different supported patterns. For HZSM-5, the Cr(acac)3/PNP catalyst was supported mainly on the surface, such that the crystal structure of HZSM-5 remained unchanged. For HY, the Cr(acac)3 and PNP were supported, as a complex, within the micropores and mesopores, again maintaining the crystal structure of HY. For NaY, the Cr(acac)3 units were supported and the PNP units were mainly confined within the supercage, with a slight changed in the framework structure of NaY. The reaction performances of the Cr(acac)3/PNP catalysts were affected significantly by the supporting material. Relative to the homogeneous catalyst, the activity and the selectivity toward 1-octene decreased over both ZSMCr and HYCr, with no observable confinement effects. After Cr(acac)3 and PNP had been supported on NaY, the activity and the selectivity toward 1-octene both increased, with an obvious confinement effect.
