The effect of reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity and time on stream on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons were studied over the synthesized catalysts. The type and nature of active sites in the aromatization of n-butane over the prepared MCM-22 catalysts have been examined. The reaction mechanism of n-butane conversion and the shape-selective property of the MCM-22 catalysts in light of their unique pore system with supercages are also discussed. The Ga- and Zn-modified MCM-22 zeolite catalysts exhibited high activity in the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbons produced over these catalysts were benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and isomers of xylene. Keywords: Zeolite; Catalyst; MCM-22; Aromatization; n-Butane 1.

The development of these high-technology, novel catalytic materials is essential because of the increasing demand for them in petrochemicals, fine chemicals and environmental catalysis. The MCM-22 zeolite is an ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicate having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X-ray powder diffraction. This zeolite was first synthesized by a research group at Mobil Oil Corporation and has been reported to be very stable thermally and to have a high surface area. Corma et al. [1] have studied the void structure of MCM-22 by using model reactions such as the isomerization/disproportionation of m-xylene and the hydroisomerization of n-decane and suggested that the MCM-22 zeolite has characteristics of both 10 MR and 12 MR zeolites. Lawton et al. [2] studied the framework topology of MCM-22 and concluded that the MCM-22 zeolite was made up of two independent pore systems with 10 MR apertures. One of the i0 MR pore systems was composed of two-dimensional, sinusoidal channels, while the other 10 MR pore system comprised of large supercages, the inner diameter of which measured 7.1 A, height 18.2 /~ and were defined by 12 MR. The applications of the acidic form of MCM-22 zeolite catalysts for the hydrocarbon conversion reactions have been mentioned in the patent literature. Some of the industrially important reactions reported are alkylation of olefins [3], skeletal and double bond isomerization [4] and conversion of olefin to higher hydrocar- bons [5]. The catalytic transformation of light hydrocarbons to valuable products of aromatics and olefins is a reaction of importance to the petrochemical industry. There has been intensive research on this reaction over proton-form and metal-modified pentasil zeolite catalysts [6-14]. However, the process is still uneconomical because of the production of large amount of undesirable gaseous products such as methane and ethane. So far, no detailed investigation of the metal-modified MCM-22 zeolite catalysts for the reaction of light alkanes to aromatic hydrocarbons have been reported in the available literature. The aim of the present work was to study the reaction of n-butane aromatization over the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts. The effect of reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity and time on stream on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the prepared catalysts were investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Synthesis of catalysts The MCM-22 zeolite was synthesized according to the procedure described in Ref. [15] with some modifications. The reagents used in the synthesis were: sodium silicate (Merck, 26.9% SiO2, 9.10% Na20, 64.11% H20), hexameth- N. Kumar, L.-E. Lindfors / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 175-187 177 yleneimine (Aldrich, 99% purity), aluminium sulphate (Merck) and sulphuric acid (Merck). The gel solution of molar composition 9.8 Na20:29.7 SIO2:A1203:13.7 R:1367.9 H20 was prepared and transferred into two 300 ml teflon cups inserted in autoclaves, which were then rotated in an oven heated at 423 K. After the completion of the synthesis, the crystalline product was washed to neutral pH and dried at 393 K for 8 h and calcined in air at 823 K for 6 h. The H-MCM-22 catalyst was obtained by repeated ion-exchange with 2 M NH4C1 solution for 72 h, washed free of chloride ions and dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined in air for 4 h. The Zn-MCM-22 and Ga-MCM-22 catalysts were obtained by ion-exchange of the H-MCM-22 with 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 6H20 and Ga(NO3)3 9H20 aqueous solutions in a rotator-evaporator. The Ga- and Zn- modified MCM-22 was dried at 373 K for 8 h and calcined at 773 K for 3 h. 2.2. Characterization of the catalysts The phase purity and the structure of the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts were determined by an X-ray powder diffractome- ter (Philips pW 1830) using CuK a radiation. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesized catalysts were characteristic of MCM-22 zeolite as described in the literature [16]. The X-ray diffraction pattern, interplanar d-spacing and relative intensity data revealed that the catalytic materials prepared were of single crystal phase and the replacement of sodium in the MCM-22 zeolite structure by protons (Figs. 1 and 2), Zn and Ga did not affect its structure and crystallinity.

Kumar, L.-E. Lindfors/Applied Catalysis A: General 14 7 (1996) 175-187 179 The morphology of the Na-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts was studied by a scanning electron microscope (Cambridge Leica 360). The zeolite samples were gold coated prior to the SEM analysis to avoid charging of the sample surface and also to obtain good images of the surface morphology. No amorphous materials were observed during the SEM analysis and the SEM micrographs of MCM-22 showed crystals having platelet morphology (Fig. 3). The specific surface area and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were determined by a Sorptomatic 1900 (Carlo Erba Instruments). The specific surface area was calculated using the Dubinin method and was found to be 750, 684 and 667 m2/g, respectively, for the H-MCM-22, Zn-MCM-22 and Ga- MCM-22 zeolite catalysts. The shape of the adsorption-desorption isotherms of nitrogen for H-MCM-22, Ga- and Zn-modified MCM-22 zeolites resembled the type II isotherms typically found for porous materials (Fig. 4). The micropore volume for MCM-22 was found to be more than 0.2 cm3/g which was larger than that of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The acidic properties of the prepared catalysts were studied by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD) using an on-line mass spectrometer (Carlo Erba Instruments) equipped with a QTMD detector. The detailed method for the temperature programmed desorption is accounted for in Ref. [6]. The TPD of ammonia study of the acidity in the catalysts revealed the presence of both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites in H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM- 22 zeolite catalysts similar to those in H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-22 catalysts [6,17]. The contents of Zn and Ga in the Zn-MCM-22 and Ga-MCM-22 catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (Outokumpu 8000) and were found to 866 Ads/Des Isotherms (MCM-22.SOR) 648 488 Volume cm31g 328 168 ,Z199 ' .4399 ' .6599 ' .8799 P/P8 Fig. 4.

The Si/A1 ratio of Na-MCM-22 was found to be 16. 2.3. Catalyst testings The catalyst testings was carried out in a fixed-bed micro-reactor. The reactor was filled with 0.5 g of catalyst and inserted in a vertical oven. The temperature of the oven was controlled with a temperature controller and the catalyst bed temperature was measured with a thermocouple. The reaction gas mixture containing 20 vol.-% n-butane and 80 vol.-% nitrogen was allowed to flow over the catalyst and the reaction products were analysed with gas chromatographs. The aromatic hydrocarbons and all the gaseous products except hydrogen were analysed with a gas chromatograph equipped with an FID detector. Hydrogen was analysed with another gas chromatograph containing a TC detector. The catalysts were pretreated in a flow of air for 3 h and in a flow of nitrogen for 30 min at 803 K prior to the catalyst testing. The first sample for the analysis of the reaction product was taken after the reactant had been in contact with the catalyst for 30 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of temperature on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts The effect of temperature on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts was studied at temperatures of 743 K, 773 K and 803 K. The conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the H-MCM-22 zeolite catalyst increased with increasing temperatures (Figs. 5 and 6). The yield of alkanes such as methane, ethane and propane increased with increasing temperatures over the H-MCM-22 catalyst, however, the yield of iso-butane decreased with increase in the temperature. The yield of iso-butane was highest, of all the gaseous products formed over the H-MCM-22 catalyst. At a temperature of 743 K, the yield of iso-butane was highest over the H-MCM-22 catalyst of all the gaseous products obtained. It was interesting to note that the yield of iso-butane was less over the H-ZSM-5 than H-MCM-22 catalyst under the same reaction conditions [17]. One possible reason for this could be the larger void space available in H-MCM-22 as compared to the H-ZSM-5 catalyst, which favours the formation of iso-butane. The formation of alkenes such as ethene, propene, iso-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 1-butene increased with increasing temperatures over the H-MCM-22 catalyst. N. Kumar, L.-E.

Effect of temperature on the conversion of n-butane over Zn-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and H-MCM-22 catalysts. The principal aromatics formed over H-MCM-22 catalyst were benzene and toluene. The active site in the conversion of n-butane over the H-MCM-22 catalyst is the strong Bronsted acid site, where the predominant reaction of cracking and oligomerization takes place. However, the role of Lewis acid sites in the dehydrogenation of reactant n-butane and alkanes formed during the reaction is not ruled out. The conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts also increased with increasing tempera- Aromatic, (Mass %) 60 40 20 Y Zn-MCM-22 ~ Ga-MCM-22 --)~ H-MCM-22 d_ 863 ~jJ~ 0 -~----J-~ -- J 713 763 813 Temperature, (K) Fig. 6.

Lindfors /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 175-187 ture. The selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts was higher than that of the H-MCM-22 catalyst. The aromatic hydrocarbons formed over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts were benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, o-, m- and p-xylene. The yield of alkanes such as methane, ethane, propane and iso-butane decreased and the yield of alkenes such as ethene, propene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, iso-butene and 1-butene increased over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts. The reason for this could be the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts, which was also evident from the large amount of hydrogen produced over the Zn- and Ga-modified MCM-22 catalysts. A similar reaction of dehydrogenation of n-butane by Ga and Zn has been proposed both by us and other authors over Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts [ 17,18]. Since many reactions proceed simultaneously producing a large number of gaseous and liquid products over the acidic, Ga and Zn sites, it is assumed that the reaction mechanism is complex and can be interpreted in different ways. However, taking into account the structure of pore systems, the product distribu- tion after the reaction and the bi-functional nature of the investigated Zn-MCM- 22 and Ga-MCM-22 catalysts, we propose that the reaction proceeds via the dehydrogenation of n-butane over the Ga and Zn sites, followed by oligomeriza- tion and cracking reactions on the strong acid sites in the 12 MR (membered rings) supercage and in the 10 MR sinusoidal channels, after which the cyclization of olefins takes place and finally the dehydrogenation of cyclic compounds occurs producing aromatic hydrocarbons. The role of the Ga and Zn species besides the dehydrogenation of n-butane is the dehydrogenation of large straight and branched chain alkenes and cycloalkenes. The efficiency with which dehydrogenation proceeds depends upon whether these species are situated on the external surface, ion-exchange position or in the channels and supercages of the MCM-22 catalysts. The determination of the exact location of Ga and Zn in the MCM-22 zeolite using different techniques could be a topic of further investigation, however, we assume that most Ga and Zn are situated on the ion-exchange positions and inside the independent channel system of the MCM-22 zeolite. Besides Bronsted acid sites and Ga and Zn species, the peculiar geometrical topology of the MCM-22 catalyst with two independent, non-intersecting medium pore 10 MR and large pore 12 MR supercages play a significant role in terms of product selectivity. It can be concluded from the product selectivity obtained over the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts that the shape selective property of MCM-22 catalysts is different from that of the ZSM-5 zeolite. This is due to the presence of non-intersecting, 10 MR two independent channel systems and large pore 12 MR supercages in one of the pore systems. The dispersion of the Ga and Zn species in the MCM-22 zeolite is also assumed to have played an important role in the conversion of n-butane and its selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons.

Effect of weight hourly space velocity on the conuersion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn- MCM-22 zeolite catalysts The effect of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons was investigated at a tempera- ture of 803 K and the space velocity was varied between 1.5 h-1 to 5.5 h-~. The conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons decreased with the increase in the space velocity over the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts (Figs. 7 and 8). At the lowest space velocity of 1.5 h-1 over the H-MCM-22 zeolite catalyst, the yield of alkanes such as methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane and alkenes such as ethene, propene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, iso-butene and 1-butene increased. The increase in alkane yield was higher than that of alkenes and also the iso-butene yield over this catalyst was much higher as compared to other alkanes. The aromatics formed the lowest space velocity of 1.5 h-~ over the H-MCM-22 catalyst were benzene and toluene. The types of gaseous products yielded over Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts were similar to those of the H-MCM-22 zeolite catalyst, however the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons obtained over these catalysts was much higher than that over the H-MCM-22 catalyst. At the space velocity of 1.5 h-~, the aromatic hydrocarbons obtained over Ga-MCM-22 were benzene, toluene, isomers of xylene and ethyl benzene. Benzene and toluene were the main aromatics formed followed by isomers of xylene and ethyl benzene. The types 184 N. Kumar, L.-E.

The reason for this was the higher content of Zn than Ga in the MCM-22 zeolite catalyst. The acid-catalysed reactions over the MCM-22 catalysts proceed via the transfer of a proton from the Bronsted acid sites to the chemisorbed n-butane molecule. However, n-butane conversion and the product distribution is influ- enced by other factors such as the interaction of adsorbed species in the MCM-22 supercages and channels and the possibility of the formed compounds to diffuse from there. It is well known from the literature that highly strong Bronsted acid sites in ZSM-5 favour side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization. However, over the MCM-22 zeolite catalysts even at the low space velocity (high contact time) of 1.5 h- ~, the formation of by-products such as methane and ethane was much lower as compared to ZSM-5. It can be concluded from this that the strength of the Bronsted acid sites is comparatively weaker than that of ZSM-5. We also observed that although there were fewer gaseous by-products as compared to the ZSM-5 zeolite, there were more liquid non-aromatic hydrocarbons formed over the MCM-22 zeolite catalysts. This could be because of the 12 MR supercage in these catalysts which favours the formation of molecules with larger dimensions because of the available space. 3.3. Effect of time on stream on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts The effect of time on stream over the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn- MCM-22 catalysts was studied at a temperature of 803 K with a weight hourly N.

The n-butane conversion and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons over the catalysts decreased slightly with time, especially at the beginning (Figs. 9 and 10). The decrease in the n-butane conversion and aromatic selectivity could be due to the coke formation over the strong Bronsted acid sites located in the channels and supercage of the MCM-22 thereby limiting access to the active sites for n-butane because of pore blocking by coke. The coke formation on the acid sites takes place because of the oligomerization of olefins which act as coke precursors. The Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts exhibited higher resistance to coke formation than the H-MCM-22 Aromatics, (Mass %) 6o~ I 40I ~ .... ~L~ ~ .... ~ __ 2O Zn-MCM-22 Ga-MCM-22 ~'~ H-MCM-22 ---__- ~ _ 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time, (h) Fig. 10.

The reactor with the H-MCM-22 catalyst was black and the reactors with the Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts were grey. The higher resistance of Ga- and Zn-modified MCM-22 to coke formation could be because of the dehydrogenation of large polymeric olefins by Zn and Ga, which could act as a coke precursor. It can also be mentioned here that few white spots were seen at the bottom of the reactor with the Zn-MCM-22 catalyst. The reason for this could be that, being volatile zinc might have diffused from the MCM-22 zeolite structure [19-21]. There was a decrease in the yield of m- and o-xylene with time on stream. One possible reason for this could be the decrease in the pore size of 10 MR pores and 12 MR supercages because of the coke deposition. The coke deposition in the supercage could be due to the formation of large molecular weight compounds such as polyalkyl aromatics and polyaromatics which act as coke precursors. 4. Conclusions Highly crystalline and phase pure H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts have been synthesized. The modification of the parent MCM-22 zeolite with H, Ga and Zn did not affect its structure and crystallinity. The specific surface area calculated by the Dubinin method and micropore volume of MCM-22 were higher than for the ZSM-5 zeolite. The acidic sites of the MCM-22 catalysts were composed of strong Bronsted and weak Lewis acid sites. The Ga and Zn species were highly dispersed in the structure of the MCM-22 zeolite. The Zn-MCM-22 and Ga-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity and stability in the aromatization of n-butane. The n-butane conversion and the selectivity to aromatics were influenced by the reaction temperature and the space velocity. The unique shape selective property of the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 catalysts was due to the peculiar geometrical topology of these catalysts, which are composed of two 10 MR non-intersecting, independent pore systems and 12 MR supercages. The presence of Ga and Zn in the MCM-22 structure enhances the selectivity to aromatics and these catalysts also exhibited higher selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons than the H-MCM-22 catalyst. The highly dispersed Ga, Zn and Bronsted acid sites in the MCM-22 zeolite structure were the active sites for the aromatization of n-butane. References [1] A. Corma, C. Corell, F. Lopis, A.

All rights reserved Synthesis, characterization and application of H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts in the aromatization of n-butane N. Kumar * L.-E. Lindfors Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Engineering,Åbo Akademi University, Biskopsgatan 8, FIN-20500Åbo, Finland * Corresponding author. The H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts were synthesized and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and nitrogen adsorption. The study of the acidic properties of the synthesized zeolite catalysts revealed that the catalysts comprised of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. n-Butane aromatization was investigated over the H-MCM-22, Ga-MCM-22 and Zn-MCM-22 zeolite catalysts. The effect of reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity and time on stream on the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons were studied over the synthesized catalysts. The type and nature of active sites in the aromatization of n-butane over the prepared MCM-22 catalysts have been examined. The reaction mechanism of n-butane conversion and the shape-selective property of the MCM-22 catalysts in light of their unique pore system with supercages are also discussed. The Ga- and Zn-modified MCM-22 zeolite catalysts exhibited high activity in the conversion of n-butane and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbons produced over these catalysts were benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and isomers of xylene. Keywords Zeolite Catalyst MCM-22 Aromatization n-Butane References [1] Corma A.
