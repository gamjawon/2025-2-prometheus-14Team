Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Biofuel Heterogeneous catalyst Graphene oxide Dehydration and 5-HMF 1 Introduction Catalysis is a key step in the synthesis of fine chemicals and drugs in the pharmaceutical industries [1]. Heterogeneous catalysis is having more advantages than homogeneous because of its recovery and reusability of expensive catalyst. In the direction of heterogeneous catalysis, metal oxides, metal supported catalysts, nanoparticles particularly magnetite have been used successfully in various organic transformations. Metal free catalysts like graphene, graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are recent developments in heterogeneous catalysis [2]. Because of their high thermal conductivity, high surface area, GO's have evoked high impacts not only for heterogeneous catalytic applications, but also in many important field such as fuel cell, lithium battery, composite materials, paper battery and electric device [3–4]. Surface functional groups of nanocarbon materials with oxygen rich groups; carboxyl, epoxy and hydroxyl group has provided an efficient way of significant and improved performance of GO due to the enhanced compatibility and surface reactivity. Variety of oxygen functional groups plays a vital role in many catalytic reactions in homogeneous and also in heterogeneous medium [5]. Besides, both the carboxylic and epoxy groups, π-conjugative giant structures of GO promote the interactions with reactants and thus participated extensively in catalytic transformation [6]. The GO has been rapidly growing as a readily available metal free, environmental friendly carbon catalyst for fine chemical synthesis with a green protocol and recyclable sustainable catalyst [7]. A great number of approaches have been developed using GO and functionalized GO as a catalysts in different reactions [8–16]. Recently our group reported that the GO has been utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidative homo and poly-coupling of 2-naphthols in toluene [17]. The catalytic conversion of renewal biomass source into the valuable biofuels has stimulated remarkable development with the increasing energy demand. The catalytic transformation of biomass into chemicals and fuel products, particularly 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is one of the rapidly growing research areas [18]. Different metal halides with ionic liquids have been studied as an efficient dehydrating candidates of glucose and fructose with high selectivity [19–21]. The most efficient heterogeneous catalysts including metal organic frame-works [22], aluminium doped zirconium phosphate [23], niobium catalysts [24] acts as a potential candidates for dehydration of fructose-precursors to 5-HMF in high yields. A number of different metal oxides have also been reported for 5-HMF synthesis from biomass by sulphated zirconia [25], ionic liquid modified silica [26], mixed metal oxides [27], resins [28], amberlyst [29], metal phosphoric acids [30], and recently reported by our group using functional CNTs [31], Mg-NHCs [32,33] and dicarboxylic acid functionalized magnetite nanoparticles [34]. In addition, Wang et al. reported metal free GO as a catalyst for the dehydration of fructose in the presence of solvents either DMSO or mixed solvent system [35]. They achieved 100% conversion of fructose and 93% selectivity of HMF in DMSO solvent. In mixed solvent (isopropanol: DMSO=90:10vol%), they also got 98% fructose conversion and 87% HMF yield. In addition, Zhu and co-workers summarized the importance of carbon based materials for the production of bio refinery materials from biomass [36]. As a part of our interest in the synthesis of 5-HMF, we report herein the dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF using a metal free GO as catalyst under solvent free conditions (Scheme 1 ). The source of biomass selected here is fructose. 2 Experiment 2.1 Catalyst preparation The GO was synthesized from graphite flake by the oxidation processes reported by the modified Hummers method using KMnO4 and H2SO4 as the oxidizing agents. In this method, the 9:1 (v/v) mixture of concentrated H2SO4/H3PO4 (360:40mL) was added to a mixture of graphite flake (3.0g) and KMnO4 (18.0g), which initiated slight exothermic reaction and temperature raised to 40°C. The mixture was then heated to 50°C and stirred for 12h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was poured into a beaker containing 400g of ice and 15mL of H2O2 (30%) and stirred till the color changes from dark violet to orange-yellow. Then the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. For purification, the product was washed seven times with 5% (v/v) HCl solution followed by deionized H2O and 200mL of ethanol. 2.2 Catalytic reaction In an oven dried flask, 180mg of fructose and 20mg of GO were mixed and sonicated without solvent. The black color mixture was kept at 100°C till yellow color appears. Later, 20.0mL of HPLC water was added to the reaction mixture (to analyse the product by HPLC), followed by the separation of the catalyst through filtration (Fig. S1). 3 Result and discussion Initially, the metal free, GO was evaluated in the dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF which is widely used as intermediate in bio-fuel and fine chemicals. The dehydration of fructose was carried out in different solvents using GO as a catalyst in the presence of air. It is quite noticeable that there is no 5-HMF formation using ethanol, methanol, dichloromethane, THF and acetonitrile in the presence of GO. However, the reaction proceeds in moderate to good yields in the presence of DMF and DMSO using GO as a catalyst (Table 1 ). Remarkably, when the reaction was conducted in the presence of water, 70% of fructose was converted with 20% selectivity towards HMF along with other products (mentioned in the supporting information). Surprisingly when the reaction was conducted in the presence of GO under solvent free conditions at 100°C, 90% of fructose was converted with 87% selectivity towards 5-HMF (Table 1, entry 11). Decrease of temperature leads to the decrease of fructose conversion with decrease in selectivity and increase of temperature increases the conversion with 85% selectivity towards HMF (Table 1, entry 13). Notably, when the graphite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used as a catalysts in the dehydration of fructose at 100°C under solvent free conditions, no conversion took place (Table 1, entry 12). The solvent free system for the dehydration of fructose is an important protocol since the removal of water from the biomass without affecting the reaction path, is highly remarkable. In this reaction acid groups of GO play an important role as a solid acid catalyst for dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF. The detailed possible mechanism for dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF is discussed in the Scheme 2 . At first the acidic part of GO interacts with OH group of fructose and the proton of the biomass transfers to catalyst as a result one water molecule is removed from the moiety under solvent free condition and hence GO regains its acidic property and active for removal of next water molecule. Finally 5-HMF is produced after removal of three moles of water. Surprisingly when the reaction was carried out in the presence of inert gas like nitrogen atmosphere, no product formation was observed either in the presence of water or solvent free conditions. After completion of the reaction under solvent free conditions, water was added to separate the catalyst and the reaction mixture. Thus recovered catalyst could be able to use for three times in the presence of air. The crystalline structures of the graphene and GO were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S2) and sharp diffraction peak at 2θ=11.0° corresponding to (002) reflection with a C-axis interlayer spacing 0.73nm, which is larger than graphite 0.32nm, indicating that functional groups were introduced in graphite to form GO with stacking pattern. The FTIR spectroscopy revealed the existence of OH stretching frequency at 3420cm−1 and CO2 stretching frequency 2920cm−1 (Fig. S3). The CO stretching frequency at 1630cm−1 indicated that carboxyl groups are retained on the GO and bending vibrations at 1460cm−1 attributed to COOH group. The spectrum at 1570cm−1, attributed to the presence of sp2 aromatic CC bonds of GO surface and the stretching frequency at 1110cm−1 is due to the presence of CO in graphene oxide. Furthermore, the Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for identification of carbon materials and their surface functionality. From the Raman spectra of GO and recovered GO (Fig. S4) the D band appears at 1335cm−1 and G band appears nearly about at 1585cm−1 were observed. The intensity ratio of the ID/IG ratio, is an indication of the number of structural sp3 CC bond defects and a measurement of the number of layers in a graphene sheets and moreover its overall π-π stacking behaviour in layer to layer. The ID/IG ratios indicate a high degree of sp3 disorderness (Fig. S4) and the increasing ID/IG ratio of recovered GO indicates the appearance of sp3 disorder. This may be due to some epoxide group reduced to OH groups. In addition, the surface compositions of GO was also confirmed by XPS (supporting information, Fig. S5 and S6) and it shows the presence oxygen and carbon binding energies at 532eV and 284eV, respectively. Moreover, the different carbon species were identified (Fig. S6), corresponding to the binding energies of carboxylic groups at 288.8eV, 285.1eV, the epoxy/hydroxyl groups at 286.6eV and sp2/sp3 carbons at 284.3eV correspondingly. The morphology and microstructure of multilayer GO were studied from SEM and TEM micrographs (Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, the SEM image of GO shows sheet like structures randomly oriented. The sheets are stacked with each other forming a 3D structure. Further a high magnification image reveals that the thin GO sheets have a size of several micrometres and are crumples in nature. The bright field TEM image shows sheet like microstructure of GO. Importantly, the SAED pattern of the GO shows the ring pattern with bright spots and the crumpled layer graphene sheet with suggesting the presence of oxygenises species on the graphitic skeleton of GO. In conclusion, the sustainable green protocol developed in the present study is new and highly environmental friendly and economical because the catalyst could be reused three times with the help of simple filtration. Moreover, the metal free carbon catalyst is developed for the dehydration of fructose is a versatile protocol for 5-HMF production.
