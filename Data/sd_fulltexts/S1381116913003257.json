Tel.: +86 02227406959. Graphical abstract Catalytic activities of Pd catalysts with hydrophobic SDB as carrier were higher than Pd3/γ-Al2O3 and Pd3/SiO2 since the hydrophobicity of SDB can prevent generated water covering the active sites. Catalytic performance of tri-metallic catalysts with Pb and Bi as promoters was higher than mono-metallic catalyst Pd3/SDB. The direct oxidative esterification of methacrolein (MAL) with methanol and oxygen to methyl methacrylate (MMA) was carried out over Pb and Bi-doped hydrophobic styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer (SDB) supported Pd catalyst under mild conditions. The Pd–Pb–Bi/SDB catalyst showed higher activity than bimetallic Pd–Pb/SDB and Pd–Bi/SDB, and much higher than monometallic Pd/SDB catalyst and hydrophilic catalysts. The multi-metallic catalysts were prepared through step impregnation method and characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that addition of Pb and Bi to Pd catalyst produced an important decrease in the metallic particle size, and the intermetallic Pd3Pb and PdBi crystals were found in the multi-metallic catalysts, which facilitate the excellent performance of multi-metallic catalyst. Keywords Hydrophobic support Palladium Methacrolein Oxidative esterification 1 Introduction Methyl methacrylate (MMA), an extremely important chemical, is mainly used for the production of acrylic plastics, polymer dispersions for paints and coatings [1]. Up to now, several different synthetic strategies toward MMA have been developed [2–4]. The technology adopted by most manufactures in the world is acetone cyanohydrins (ACH) process, which accounts for about 85% of production capacity in the world. However, the procurement of the raw material hydrogen cyanide and the high cost of the waste treatment of by-produced ammonium sulfide have become severe problems [5]. From the economic and environmental point of view, a route of single-step oxidative esterification of methacrolein to methyl methacrylate under mild conditions is therefore highly desirable [6–8]. This process uses molecular oxygen as the oxidant in the presence of methanol and a catalyst. For the catalyzed reaction, this post-transition-metal-catalyzed oxidative esterification is expected to be a versatile procedure directly giving esters from aldehydes and alcohols. The oxidative reaction of MAL over monometallic palladium catalyst has been reported [9]. The yield is not sufficient. One reason may be that the metal has been oxidized and occasionally cause a severe leaching into the reaction medium [10]. Some patents [11–15] indicate that the incorporation of promoting elements in Pd-based supported catalysts drastically increases the catalytic activity, especially Pb and Bi, which are well known for displaying attractive properties as promoting elements in noble metal-based catalysts for the selective oxidation. The promoter effects of Pb and Bi for monometallic Pd x /SDB catalysts for the direct oxidative esterification reaction have been studied in our group, the catalysts are noted in the manner: M x M′ y M″ z /SDB, where x, y and z is the weight percentage content by support, M′ and M″ is the metal incorporated in second and third position. In oxidative esterification of MAL with molecular oxygen and methanol, the carrier of catalyst has a great influence on the MMA yield. In previous studies, a series of hydrophilic catalyst supports such as Al2O3 [8,16], ZnO [11], MgO [17] and SiO2 [18] have been investigated and the most widely used is γ-Al2O3. As we know, esterification is a reversible reaction with water as by-product. When conventional hydrophilic catalysts are exposed to the reaction system, capillary condensation takes place on the catalysts and retards the diffusion of reactants to active sites. For the water-containing reaction, hydrophobic catalysts are expected to have a relatively high reaction rate because of the strong mass transfer. It is noted that porous styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer (SDB) is hydrophobic material with large surface area that is suitable for being used as catalyst support, and many literatures have reported the use of SDB in the reaction involving water [19–22]. In this work, mono- and multi-metallic catalysts for the direct oxidative esterification of MAL to MMA with different supports were prepared by step impregnation method and then characterized. Catalytic performances of catalysts with hydrophobic supports were evaluated and compared with hydrophilic catalysts. We also show that the catalytic activities of Pd catalysts are greatly improved by the addition of Pb and Bi. The effects of the reduction conditions and reused times on the reactivity were investigated for the formation of MMA. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the catalysts All chemicals used in the research were purchased from Tianjin Reagent Company. Four different SDB used in this study were corresponding to the trade names X-5, D3520, D4006 and NKA. They were pretreated by absolute methanol to remove any water and insoluble impurities that might be absorbed in the supports. After dried, they were sieved to 30–40 mesh granules. The metal precursors were PdCl2, Pb(Ac)2 and BiCl3. Monometallic catalysts with hydrophobic supports were prepared by the incipient impregnation method using N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) as solvent. The SDB supports were impregnated with the metal solution overnight, followed by vacuum drying at 333K for 8h to remove the DMF, then dried under infrared light for 6h and reduced with 50mL (NTP)/min of H2 at 393–523K at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 10h. All bimetallic catalysts Pd x M′ y /SDB(X-5) were synthesized by impregnation of the monometallic Pd x /SDB(X-5) with an organic solvent of corresponding precursors in DMF. For trimetallic catalysts Pd x M′ y M″ z /SDB, the third element was introduced similarly by impregnation of the bimetallic catalysts in solvent with target elements. Catalysts with hydrophilic supports as SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 were prepared from water solution of PdCl2 by aqueous impregnation. The catalysts were dried at 333K for 8h under a slight vacuum to remove the water, dried in air at 383K for 6h, calcined at 773K for 4h and then reduced in hydrogen atmosphere for 2h at 473K until the pH of the reduction furnace outlet became neutral, and then loaded the second and third components as the previous steps, respectively. 2.2 Characterization of the catalysts The BET surface area and porosities were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77K using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 (American Micromeritics) automated system. The porosities were calculated by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. XRD spectra were obtained ex situ using a Pilips power/thin film diffractometer PW1140 with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1541nm), at 40kV. The samples were scanned at a rate of 0.02°/step with 2θ varying from 30 to 80°. The morphology of the samples was characterized by an ESEM (XL30 ESEM-FEG, FE I, USA) operating at 30kV. TEM analysis of the metal particles was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope. Particle size measurements were performed particle by particle, using ITEM software on digitized micrographs. The average metal particle size d was calculated using the following formula: d =Σn i d i/Σn i, where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i. The XPS experiments were performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer employing a monochromated Al-Ka X-ray source (hv =1486.6eV). The static contact angles of water drops on the surfaces were measured with an automatic contact angle meter combined with flash camera equipment (GBX, France) at room temperature. 2.3 Catalytic reaction The direct oxidative esterification of MAL to MMA was performed in a thermostated glass reactor (100mL v and 5cm i.d.) with a stirrer and an O2 supply system. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure, 50°C, pH=10.5 and a methanol/MAL molar ratio of 40. The mixture was stirred at 500rpm, and oxygen was introduced at a constant flow rate of 6mL/min. Once the temperature was stable, the catalyst was added to the solution and the oxidation reaction started by introducing oxygen. The reaction samples trapped by a condenser at −20°C were taken every 30min, filtered and analyzed by GC (Aglient gas chromatograph model GDX-103; thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector, equipped with a DB-WAX capillary column, 6m×Φ3; and a SP4270 data processor). The MAL conversion and MMA selectivity for each experiment were calculated as follows: MAL conversion ( % ) = C 0 , MAL − C MAL C 0 , MAL × 100 % MMA selectivity ( % ) = C MMA C 0 , MAL − C MAL × 100 % wherein C 0,MAL is the initial molar concentration of MAL, C MAL is the molar concentration of MAL after time t, and C MMA is the molar concentration of MMA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Influence of supports A series of supports were characterized by BET. The parameters of porosity and contact angles that were measured and listed in Table 1 Catalytic performances of the multi-metallic catalysts with different supports were investigated by comparing the total conversion of MAL and the selectivity of the products. As shown in Table 1, the results indicate that catalytic activities of catalysts with SDB as carriers were higher than that with Al2O3 and SiO2. It proves that the high activities exhibited by the hydrophobic catalysts are directly related to their hydrophobicity. Since the moistures from atmosphere and oxidation would not be adsorbed on the surface thus the active sites would not be cloaked. On the other hand, organic ingredients are more readily adsorbed on the hydrophobic surface, and then the concentration of adsorbed reactants is increased [23]. The higher activity of the catalysts with SDB(X-5) and SDB(NKA) can be due to the large surface area of SDB(X-5, 483m2/g and NKA, 480m2/g), which makes active metal well dispersed on the SDB surface and subsequently increases the catalytic performance. However, the SDB(NKA) is high in porosity, low in strength. It is easy to break into small fragments or reduce to powder after the reaction. In total, SDB(X-5) is the best carrier and selection for further study. Furthermore, the structures of the SDB(X-5) and Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB(X-5) samples were determined by ESEM. As shown in Fig. 1 the support was spherical, with uniform diameter of 400–750μm, which was helpful to reduce the collisional crushing (Fig. 1(a)). The porousness of the support provided abundant surface area for active components (bright points) to disperse, which was a key factor that influenced catalyst performance (Fig. 1(b)). The particle size and distribution of the Pd3/SDB(X-5) and Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB(X-5) catalysts were investigated by TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 metal particles were well dispersed on the SDB supports and the average particle sizes of Pd3/SDB(X-5) and Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB(X-5) were 6 and 4.7nm, respectively, indicating that the addition of Pb and Bi ameliorated the metal distribution on the supports in some degree. 3.2 Influence of additive metal components The introduction of the second (or third) metal so as to improve the activity, selectivity and stability of the catalysts is a widespread strategy in oxidation catalysts’ preparation [24–26]. We continue the study of the effect of promoters based on Pd3/SDB(X-5), Pd3Pb0.6/SDB(X-5) and Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB(X-5) under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Table 2 these multi-metallic catalysts performances were better than the mono-metallic and bi-metallic catalysts. In order to explain this result, catalysts were characterized by XRD and the crystalline phases were identified by reference to the JCPDS data file. As shown in Fig. 3 for Pd3/SDB(X-5), the main peaks nearby 40°, 46°, 68° were detected corresponding to <111>, <200>, <220> Pd planes and no PdO peaks can be seen (Fig. 3a), indicating that the metal precursor had been reduced completely. For catalysts of Pb and/or Bi deposited on the Pd3/SDB(X-5), the main diffraction peaks shifted toward low diffraction angle direction compared with those for the pure Pd. As shown in Fig. 3, the diffraction intensity of Pd peaks in bi-metallic catalyst was reduced by the addition of Pb and further reduced by incorporation of Bi, indicating that promoters improved the metal dispersion on the carrier. In bi-metallic and tri-metallic catalysts, the appearance of peaks at 38.7, 52 and 39.8° proved a strong interaction between Pd–Pb and Pd–Bi, leading to the formation of two binary alloys composed of Pd3Pb [27] and PdBi [24,28]. With the addition of metal Bi to the bimetallic catalyst, the peak at 2θ =52° disappeared, the reason may be that with the influence of Bi, the alloy converted to an amorphous structure and well dispersion. On the other hand, the positive effect of Pb and Bi doping in catalyst on improvement of catalytic activity might be attributed to the good adsorption and transfer of substrates methacrolein, methanol or oxygen on this catalyst. In order to investigate the valence states of Pd on the surface of tri-metallic catalysts and further understand the influence of the additives to the catalytic performance, Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB was characterized by XPS, and the spectrum analysis was based on data obtained from the “Handbook of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy” [29]. The curve fittings of Pd XPS 3d spectra are shown in Fig. 4 the binding energy of Pd 3d5/2 in catalysts with additives Pb and Bi was 336.2eV, which was higher compared to 335.2eV for Pd metal. We can infer that the electron of Pd transferred to promoters in this tri-metallic catalyst. Furthermore, according to Bertolini et al. [30], there was certain correlation between the particle sizes of a Pd supported catalyst and the binding energy. For multi-metallic, there could be some solid solution of oxygen on Pd characterized by a 3d level shift of about 0.4eV, and could cause a reduction in relaxation energy and thus an increase in binding energy. It expounded the reason of high performance of tri-metallic. 3.3 Influence of reducing conditions on catalytic activity The activities of the catalysts prepared by impregnation method are affected by various synthesis parameters, especially reduction temperature and time. The effects of reduction temperature and reduction time on catalytic activity were studied and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5 It can be observed from Fig. 5(a) that MAL conversion and MMA selectivity increased from 120 to 200°C and kept invariant at 200°C, for which the reason was that only the temperature was high enough can metal precursors be reduced to the desired metal valence. When temperature is higher than 240°C, Pd on the catalyst surface will be sintered and the carriers will be depolymerized. It can be concluded that 200°C is the optimum reduction temperature with the highest MAL conversion and MMA selectivity for the reaction. Reduction time should also be considered carefully because it affects the reduction progress and reduction degree. Theoretically, long reduction time is favorable for the metal to be completely reduced, but not from the economic perspective. In this reduced procedure we choose hydrogen with slow flow as reductant. It can be seen from Fig. 5(b) that the MAL conversion and MMA selectivity increased the reduction time in the range of 4–10h, subsequently, both the conversion and selectivity kept unchanged as time went on. From the economic point of view, 10h was selected as the optimum reduction time. 3.4 Multi-metallic catalyst recyclability With higher catalytic activity (Table 2), multi-metallic catalyst has broader application prospects. For a truly effective polymer-supported catalyst, it is critical that the recovery should be simple and efficient. Thus the catalytic recycle was studied to investigate the consistency of the catalyst activity and recyclability. In each cycle, the Pd3Pb0.6Bi1.5/SDB tri-metallic catalyst was easily recovered through simple filtration and drying and then used for subsequent reaction. The catalyst recyclability was tested by conducting the reaction at the similar conditions as described in Table 2. Both of the MAL conversion and MMA selectivity have a slight reduction during the five recycling reactions as shown in Table 3 Hence, from the environmental and industrial point of view, the recyclability of the catalyst makes the process economically and potentially viable for commercial applications. 4 Conclusions The multi-metallic catalysts with different supports were prepared for oxidative esterification of MAL with methanol to MMA. Because of the capillary condensation, catalysts supported on hydrophilic materials γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 presented lower activity than that supported on hydrophobic SDB. Taking the factors of surface area and strength into account, SDB(X-5) was the most appropriate carrier. In the multi-metallic catalyst, the formation of the intermetallics Pd3Pb and PdBi were found. The addition of Pb and Bi ameliorated the metal distribution on the supports, which lead to higher catalytic activities than the monometallic catalysts at the same reaction conditions. The reducing conditions of catalysts have also been investigated, and the optimum reduction temperature and time were 200°C and 10h, respectively.
