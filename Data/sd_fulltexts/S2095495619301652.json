Transition metal sulfides are emerging as promising electrode materials for energy storage and conversion. In this work, hierarchical FeS2/C nanospheres are synthesized through a controllable solvothermal method followed by the annealing process. Spherical FeS2 core is homogeneously coated by thin carbon shell. The hierarchical nanostructure and carbon coating can enhance electron transfer and accommodate the stress originated from the volume change as well as suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfide. Consequently, as the cathode material of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the FeS2/C nanospheres exhibit high reversible capacity of 676 mAh g−1 and excellent cycling life with the capacity retention of 97.1% after 100 cycles. In addition, even at the high current density of 1.8 C, a reversible capacity of 437 mAh g−1 is obtained for the FeS2/C nanospheres, demonstrating its great prospect for practical applications in high-performance LIBs. Graphical abstract Hierarchical FeS2/C nanospheres were prepared by a facile solvothermal method and demonstrated with high discharge capacity, good cycling stability and enhanced rate capability. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Iron sulfide Carbon coating Cathode Nanosphere Lithium ion batteries 1 Introduction In the wake of development in electric vehicles and portable electronic devices, the high energy-density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with low cost have been the research focus and come into a period of rapid growth [1–5]. As we know, the capacity and the energy density of LIBs mainly depend on the cathode material. However, the conventional LIBs, such as LiMO2 (M=transition metal) and LiFeO4 cathode materials, exhibit specific capacities lower than 200 mAh g−1, unable to meet the growing demand of electric vehicles field. Transition metal sulfides with higher capacity over traditional cathode have attracted great attention owing to their higher capacity, good electrochemical redox reactivity arising from electrochemical conversion reaction. Among the transition metal sulfide candidates, extensive efforts have been focused on pyrite (FeS2) because of its large energy density of 1273 Wh kg−1, high theoretical capacity of 894 mAh g−1, cost effectiveness, low toxicity and natural abundance [6,7]. However, the practical application of FeS2 in LIBs is still hampered. The capacity retention and rate capability of FeS2 are not satisfactory due to its poor inherent conductivity and severe volume expansion via conversion reactions. Furthermore, polysulfide Li2S x (2 <x <8) generated during discharged process will dissolve into the electrolyte and run off because of shuttle effect, resulting in fast capacity fading. Up to now, there are many strategies to address these obstacles by designing pyrite cathode with tailored structure or modifying by other conductive matrix/coating. Firstly, fabrication of nanostructured pyrite, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanoplates, nanoneedles, nanowires and nanocubes [8–13], can solve the holdbacks to some extent with the help of shorter diffusion distance of Li+ and larger surface area. Especially, well-designed nanostructures can provide lots of benefits such as much easier Li+ diffusion and better accommodation of the volume expansion and strain, resulting in improved capacity and electrochemical kinetics. Meanwhile, another effective approach is to wrap the electrode materials with conductive matrixes, such as polymer, graphene oxide and carbon [14–17], not only to effectively suppress the shuttle of polysulfide, but also enhance the electron transport and improve structural stability of electrode, leading to improved rate and cycling capabilities. Therefore, we combine hierarchical structure and carbon coating into the pyrite electrode to form high-performance cathode. To date, there is no work on synthesis of hierarchical FeS2/C composite nanospheres. Additionally, the research on their lithium ion storage performance is also in the blank. In the present work, we report hierarchical FeS2/C nanospheres composed of interconnected thin FeS2/C nanosheets prepared by a facile solvothermal method. In the well-designed flower-like nanospheres, high surface and porous structure are combined. As a cathode of LIBs, the FeS2/C nanospheres exhibit noticeable improvement in high rate performance and cycling stability, which can be ascribed to the flower-like nanospheres structure together with the uniform carbon layer. The composite can enhance electron/ion transfer, improve structure stability as well as the electrical conductivity, resulting in excellent rate capability. In addition, the proposed preparation method is also suited to the synthesis of other metal sulfides in the fields of electrochemical energy storage, catalysis and sensing. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis The FeS2 nanospheres were prepared by a solvothermal method. Typically, 1 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.8 g of Na2S2O3, 0.02 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.3 g urea and 0.1 g thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) were dissolved in 90 mL ethanol. Then, the above solution was sealed in Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 24 h. After that, the sample was washed by DI water and then treated in furnace at 300 °C for 2 h in argon to obtain FeS2 nanospheres. Afterwards, the FeS2 nanospheres were dispersed in 0.05 M glucose solution overnight and finally calcined at 550 °C for 1.5 h in Ar atmosphere to obtain FeS2/C nanospheres. 2.2 Characterization The phase and purity of the as-obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Miniflex600, Rigaku), using Cu K α radiation at a scan rate of 0.02 °/s, and Raman spectroscopy under the excitation length of 532 nm (WITec-CRM200). The morphologies and microstructures of the as-obtained samples were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS microscope), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G20). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The FeS2/C nanospheres as working electrodes were prepared in CR2025 coin-type cell as our previous work did [18]. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box using 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 in volume) as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test was conducted on battery test system (LAND, Wuhan, China) in the voltage range of 1.2–2.6 V at room temperature at different current densities. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was tested at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were studied on the electrochemical workstation in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz with the excitation voltage of 5 mV. The mass loading of the as-prepared composite was about 1.3 mg cm−2. The capacity of electrodes was calculated based on the mass of FeS2. For the as-obtained FeS2/C nanospheres, the content of carbon was ∼3 wt%. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis process of the FeS2/C nanospheres is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the solvothermal step, the precursors first form FeS2 nanosheets. In order to decrease the surface energy, the FeS2 nanosheets are assembled to nanospheres structures. Secondly, the FeS2/C nanospheres are obtained by immersing the FeS2 nanospheres into the aqueous glucose and followed by an annealing process. The morphology of FeS2 nanospheres is shown in Fig. 2 (a, b). The monodispersed hierarchical FeS2 nanospheres showdiameters of 500 to 600 nm, which are composed of ultrathin nanosheets as primary building blocks. In addition, there are lots of nanopores between interconnected nanosheets in this microstructure, which provides a high surface area. After coating carbon layer, the nanosphere morphology of FeS2/C nanospheres is well preserved with the well-distributed size of about 550 nm (Fig. 2c, d). The detailed micro-morphology analysis of the two samples was monitored by TEM-HRTEM (Fig. 3 ), confirming that both FeS2 and FeS2/C nanospheres have perfect spherical structure with the well-distributed diameter of 500–600 nm. Furthermore, HRTEM image in Fig. 3(d) clearly demonstrates a distinct composite structure of FeS2/C nanospheres. The thickness of amorphous carbon layer is about 4–5 nm, uniformly coating on the FeS2 nanospheres. In addition, EDS elemental mapping analysis in Fig. 3(e) demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Fe, S and C. The nanospheres composite structure and uniform carbon shell coating are confirmed in the FeS2/C nanospheres. The conductive porous structure is favorable for fast lithium ion storage. The phase and purity of the as-prepared FeS2 and FeS2/C nanospheres were confirmed by the XRD (Fig. 4 a). All the characteristic peaks of both samples can be assigned to the cubic structure of FeS2 (JCPDS 42-1340). And there is no peak of carbon detected in the pattern of FeS2/C nanospheres, which suggests the amorphous nature and low content of the C in the FeS2/C nanospheres. To further confirm the conclusion from XRD patterns, Raman spectroscopy was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 4(b). Both samples at low wave number have three feature peaks at 338, 367, 420 cm−1, which belong to the E g, A g and T g modes of FeS2, respectively [19,20]. Moreover, there are two strong peaks at high wave number of FeS2/C nanospheres. The peaks located at about 1550 and 1355 cm−1, which are assigned to graphitic G bands of carbon and typical disorder-induced D, respectively [21]. It reveals that the carbon layer originated from carbonization of glucose is amorphous. According to the BET test (Fig. 4c), the FeS2/C nanospheres exhibit a specific surface area of ∼69 m2 g−1, little higher than the FeS2/C nanospheres (∼60 m2 g−1). Additionally, according to the TGA curve, we can deduce that the carbon content of the FeS2/C nanospheres is about 3 wt%. The TGA test was conducted in air. The FeS2/C would decompose and leave the final product: Fe2O3. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the weight loss is 35.4 wt%. By adverse inference, the FeS2 accounts for about 97 wt% in the FeS2/C. Therefore, the carbon content is about 3 wt%. In view of the potential application of FeS2/C nanospheres as a cathode in LIBs, we evaluated its reversible lithium storage properties. The CV curves of as-obtained electrodes with the potential window of 1.1–2.7 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for the first two cycles are shown in Fig. 5 (a, b). In the first cathodic scan, the curves of both electrodes (Fig. 5a) have only one sharp reduction peak, which is assigned to the conversion reaction [9,22,23]: (1) FeS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Fe + 2Li2S After the first lithiation process, the reduction products are Fe and Li2S [24,25]. In the first anodic sweep, there are two well-defined peaks at 1.90 and 2.53 V observed due to the formation of FeS and sulfur, respectively [15,26], expressed as the following reactions [27,28]: (2) Fe + Li2S − 2e− → FeS + 2Li+ (3) Li2S−2e− →1/8 S8+ 2Li+ For the second reduction-oxidation cycle, the reduction peak shifts notably to ∼1.29 V and a new reduction peak is observed at ∼1.97 V in Fig. 5(b). These two peaks are the reverse processes of Eqs. (2) and (3). Meanwhile, the current density of the FeS2/C nanospheres is much larger than that of FeS2 nanospheres, indicating the sufficient reaction with Li+ after the carbon layer coating. Fig. 5(c,d) shows the galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of both electrodes at the rate of 0.3 C with the voltage window from 1.2 to 2.6 V. Both electrodes exhibit the similar curves, suggesting that the different surface modification does not change the electrochemical nature of FeS2. In the first cycle, there is one discharge plateaus near 1.50 V, which corresponds to the reduction of FeS2 to Fe and Li2S, corresponding to reaction (1). The second lithiation process is different from the first one, which is due to the different reaction kinetics and pathways. In the delithiation process, there are two plateaus shown at ∼1.75 and 2.5 V, which can be ascribed to the reaction (2) and reaction (3), respectively, in accordance with the CV curves. Based on the mass of the FeS2/C composite, the initial discharge capacities of FeS2/C and FeS2 nanospheres are 808 and 681 mAh g−1, respectively. Herein, the capacity contribution only comes from FeS2 in our voltage window between 1.2 to 2.6 V while the carbon layer will not contribute capacity. Note that the CE of FeS2/C nanospheres observed in the first cycle is 88.2%, higher than that of FeS2 nanospheres (86.6%), mainly due to the improved reaction kinetics by introducing carbon layer. Fig. 6 (a) exhibits the discharge capacities versus cycle number at current rate of 0.3 C. The FeS2/C nanospheres shows much more stable cycling performance compared with FeS2 nanospheres electrode. After 100 charge-discharge cycling, the discharge capacity of FeS2/C nanospheres electrode achieves a capacity of 676 mAh g−1 with the capacity retention of 91.4% based on the second discharge capacity. However, the FeS2 nanospheres electrode suffered a serious capacity decay and the capacity retention is only 72.5%. Additionally, the lithium storage performance of FeS2/C nanospheres is superior to the previous works on FeS2/C-based composites, as shown in Table 1 [29–32]. Furthermore, the FeS2/C nanospheres show better high-rate capability than that of the FeS2 nanospheres, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). At different rates of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 C, high specific capacities of 814, 642, 598, 558, 504, 437 mAh g−1 are obtained, respectively. At the same rate, the discharge capacities of FeS2/C nanospheres are always much higher than those of FeS2 nanospheres. With the increase of rates, both electrodes show the gradual capacity fading, indicating that the electrode reactions are mainly limited by the diffusion kinetics. In addition, the cycling performance at 1.5 C is presented in Fig. 6(c). Notice that the FeS2/C electrode still shows much better stability than the unmodified FeS2 electrode. The enhanced cycling capability and high-rate performance of FeS2/C nanospheres are mainly due to the following positive factors: (1) Improved electric conductivity and Li ion transfer during electrochemical process. EIS measurements of both electrodes at full-discharged state after 10 cycles were conducted to further study the kinetics of electrode reaction (Fig. 6d). The curves including three parts of both electrodes are almost the same. Firstly, the intersection point in the x-axis is related to the solution resistance. The depressed semicircles are assigned to the interfacial charge transfer resistance (R ct) [33,34]. The inclined line in the low frequency is designated to Warburg impedance (Z w), corresponding to ions diffusion into the bulk of the electrode [35,36]. The charge transfer resistance of FeS2/C nanospheres is much lower compared to that of FeS2 nanospheres after 10 cycles. It suggests that carbon coating indeed provides more effective transfer of the Li+ and electrons, thus improving the electrochemical activity and reaction kinetics. That's one of the key factors to enhance the electrochemical performance of FeS2/C nanospheres [37–40]. (2) The carbon layer can stop the shuttle of polysulfides to achieve better cycles [41–43]. SEM images (Fig. 7 ) of FeS2/C and FeS2 nanospheres after 100 cycles at 0.3 C are shown in the revised manuscript. It is seen that the structure of FeS2/C nanospheres is better preserved than the FeS2 nanospheres. All these factors work together to contribute better rate performance of FeS2/C nanospheres. 4 Conclusions To sum up, a facile solvothermal synthesis followed by the annealing process is proposed to prepare hierarchical FeS2/C nanospheres composed of interconnected thin FeS2 nanosheets with carbon layer coating. The FeS2/C nanospheres have the advantages of hierarchical porous nanostructure and conductive uniform amorphous carbon layer. Due to the reduced Li+ diffusion distance, enhanced electrical conductivity and good accommodation of volume stress, the FeS2/C nanospheres show high specific capacity, excellent long-term cycling performance and superior rate capability, which is promising for the application of LIBs with high-energy and high-power densities.
