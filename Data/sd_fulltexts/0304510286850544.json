The hydroformyla- tion by the bimetallic catalysts was remarkably influenced by the nature of the solvent used, and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol were the best among the solvents employed. Thus, the initial rate of the hydroformylation of cyclohexene with the Co2(CO)8--Ru3(CO)i2 catalyst (Ru:Co=l:l) in methanol was nineteen times faster than that with Co2(CO)g, if the reaction was performed at 110 C under CO:H2 pressure (40:40 kg cm~2 initial pres- sure at room temperature). The bimetallic systems were also effective for the hydroesterification of cyclohexene. The synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium on hydroformylation and hydroesterification is discussed. Introduction Homogeneous multimetallic catalysts have recently been receiving much attention because it is hoped that the cooperativity of different metals during chemical transformations might lead to more selective and efficient reactions and, in some cases, to new types of reactions which are inaccesible through homometallic systems. Many examples using bimetallic catalysts have appeared in recent years, including the hydroformylation and amino- methylation reactions of 1-pentene using the water-gas shift reaction with *For Part 5, see ref. 18. ** Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 30 an iron-ruthenium bimetallic system [I], hydroformylation reactions of olefins using cobalt-rhodium clusters as catalyst precursors [2], homolo- gation reactions of methanol [3-6] and carboxylic acid methyl esters [7 - 8] by cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal catalysts, hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to ethylene glycol and its derivatives by rhodium-ruthenium bi- metallic catalysts [9], synthesis of 7-keto acids from alkynes, methyl iodide and carbon monoxide by cobalt-ruthenium bimetallic phase-transfer cataly- sis [10], and the reduction of nitro compounds by cobalt-rhodium bime- tallic phase-transfer catalysis [11]. In a previous paper [4] we reported that cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal catalysts were very effective for the homologation of methanol to ethanol and in the reaction, ruthenium not only was involved in the hydro- genation of acetaldehyde to ethanol, but also slightly but notably enhanced acetaldehyde formation. These observations led us to discover that Co2(CO)8 Ru3(CO)i2 bimetallic systems show high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of olefins compared with Co2(CO)g or Ru3(CO)i2 alone, since both processes involve alkyi and acyi complexes as common intermediates. This was briefly reported in a previous paper [12]. We des- cribe here full details of the hydroformylation and hydroesterification of olefins with cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal catalysts. Results Hydroformylation of cyclohexene Table 1 summarizes the results of the hydroformylation of cyclohexene in THF using Co2(CO)8 Ru3(CO)i2 mixed metal catalysts. The yield of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (1) with the bimetallic catalyst is considerably higher than would be expected by a simple additive effect based on the values observed for Co2(CO)g and Ru3(CO)i2, respectively. Thus, the yield of (1) in Run 5 was much higher than the sum of the yields of (1) from Runs 1 and 2. Furthermore, as more Ru3(CO)i2 was added to Co2(CO)g, the initial rate increased. At Ru: Co =9.9:1, the initial rate was twenty-seven times faster than that with Co2(CO)8 alone. When the conversion of cyclohexene increased above ca. 50%, 2,4,6-tricyclohexyl-l,3,5-trioxane was formed together with the aldehyde (1), but neither cyclohexanemethanol nor cyclo- hexane was formed under the conditions employed, although a small amount of cyclohexanemethanol was formed at very high conversion of cyclohexene. The time-dependence curve of the reaction pressure, illustrated in Fig. 1, clearly shows that the cobalt-ruthenium bimetallic systems provide high catalytic activities for the hydroformylation of cyclohexene. With Ru3(CO)i2 alone, the pressure scarcely changed throughout the reaction, whereas with Co2(CO)s alone, the pressure decreased linearly but slowly after an induction period of ca. 40 min. However, at Ru:Co = 0.95:1, the pressure drop was much greater than that with the Co2(CO)g system, although a similar induc- tion period was observed. At Ru:Co = 9.9:1, no induction period was ob- 31 TABLE 1 Hydroformylation of cyclohexene by Co and/or Ru catalysts\" Run Catalyst R.u:Co Yield of (1) Initial rate (%)11 (VoT 1 Co2(CO)g 14 1.0 2'1 Ru3(CO)i2 - 3 0.3 3 Co2(CO)8 + Ru3(CO)i2 0.34 32 3.6 4 Co2(CO)s + Ru3(CO)i2 0.95 62 5.9 5 Co2(CO)g + Ru3(CO)n 3.2 62 8.4 6 Co2(CO)g + Ru3(CO)i2 9.9 100 27 7 Co2(CO)s + Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2 0.96 0 0 81 Co2(CO)g + Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2 0.89 10 1.1 9s Co2(CO)8 + Ru(CO)4(PPh3) 0.99 35 3.3 10 HRuCo3(CO)n + HC(PPh2)3 0.33 37 3.0 aReaction conditions: Co, 0.2 mg atom; cyclohexene, 80 mmol; THF, 10 ml; reaction temp., 110 C; reaction time, 4 h; CO;H:2= 40:40 kg cm\"2 (initial pressure at room temp.).

A tri- phosphine, tris(diphenylphosphino)methane, was also added to the cobalt- ruthenium mixed metal cluster HRuCo3(CO)i2 in order to maintain the two metals in close proximity under the reaction conditions. However, no im- provement of the rate was observed (Table 1, Run 10). Solvent effect is shown in Table 2, where the initial rate is represented as the relative value compared with that using Co^CCOg in THF. The initial rate of the hydroformylation of cyclohexene with Co2(CO)g was almost independent of the nature of the solvent employed, except for pyridine. In contrast, the initial rate of the same reaction with the cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal catalysts was influenced by the nature of the solvent. Inter- estingly, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol were the best among the solvents investigated. The rate of the hydroformylation using a Ru:Co molar ratio of 1:1 or 10:1 in methanol was nineteen or thirty-two times faster, respectively, than that with Co2(CO)8 alone in THF. In this case, the aldehyde initially formed is mostly converted into its dimethyl acetal.

As shown in Table 3, the initial rate of the hydroformylation of 1-hexene in benzene by the bimetallic catalyst with a Ru:Co molar ratio of 1:1 was about three times faster than that with Co2(CO)g alone. However, the normaLiso ratio of the aldehydes formed was essentially the same as in the case of Co2(CO)8. It is noteworthy that the initial rate is not much greater than that in the hydro- formylation of cyclohexene, because in the latter case the relative rate increases about ninefold under the same reaction conditions (Table 2, Run 5). On the other hand, the initial rate of the hydroformylation of styrene was roughly doubled if the bimetallic catalyst was used instead of Co2(CO)g.

''Described as the pressure drop (kg cm\"2 min~1) at the early stage of the reaction. 34 The rate of hydroformylation of olefins with Co2(CO)g decreases in the following order: 1-hexene ^ styrene ~ cyclohexene (Table 4). 1-Hexene is rapidly hydroformylated, whereas cyclohexene and styrene are much less reactive\". However, if the cobalt-ruthenium bimetallic catalyst is used, cyclo- hexene as well as 1-hexene are much more readily converted into the corres- ponding aldehydes than is styrene. The synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium on hydroformylation of olefins occurs in the following order: cyclohexene > 1-hexene > styrene. It is of great interest that cyclohexene, which is the least reactive substrate in the Co^CC^g-catalyzed hydroformyla- tion [13], is the most effectively hydroformylated if the bimetallic catalyst is used. Hydroesterification of cyclohexene The cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal carbonyl catalyst is also effective for the hydroesterification of cyclohexene (eqn. (2)). As shown in Table 5, the yield of the methyl ester (2) was notably improved on using the mixed metal catalyst.

Discussion Although the mechanism of the hydroformylation reaction with Co2(CO)s proposed by Heck and Breslow is widely accepted [14, 15], the hydrogenolysis step of a metal acyi intermediate forming aldehydes is still the subject of controversy. Certain evidence has indicated that the dinuclear reductive elimination of aldehydes from metal acyls and metal hydrides occurs in the cobalt- [16] and rhodium- [17] catalyzed hydroformylation. This led us to expect that the synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium 35 might be explained by such a dinuclear reductive elimination between a cobalt acyi and a ruthenium hydride. We have recently investigated the reactions between hexanoyl cobalt tetracarbonyl and several kinds of metal carbonyl hydrides, including HCo(CO)4, [HRu3(CO)u]~ and [HRu(CO)4]~ as the model reactions [18]. Interestingly, the hydride [HRu(CO)4]~ reacts much more readily with the acyi cobalt complex to form hexanal than does HCo(CO)4. This finding indicates that ruthenium is probably involved in the aldehyde-forming step in the hydroformylation with the cobalt-ruthenium mixed metal catalysts. Whyman reported that in the hydroformylation of internal olefins catalyzed by Co2(CO)s, initial interaction of the olefin with the hydrido species HCo(CO)4 might be the rate-determining step [19]. As described above, the synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium is most effectively observed if cyclohexene is hydroformylated with the cobalt-ruthenium bimetallic systems. This indicates that ruthenium might also be involved in the olefin insertion step. This is compatible with the fact that a synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium also appears in the hydroesterification of olefins which does not involve the hydrogenolysis of an acyi complex as an elementary step. Recently, Hazel and coworkers have observed that only in the presence of a platinum(O) complex does ReH7(PR3)i react with ethylene to give ReH3(C2H4)2(PR3)2 (PRs = PPhPrS or P(cyclopentyl)3) [20]. It seems plausible that a platinum-ethylene complex is first formed, and the coordi- nated ethylene is then tranferred to the rhenium hydride via a platinum- rhenium mixed metal complex. Experimental section Materials All olefins and solvents were purified by conventional methods and distilled under nitrogen atmosphere. The compound Co2(CO)g was obtained commercially and used without further purification. The compounds Ru3(CO)i2 [21], Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2 [22], Ru(CO)4(PPh3) [23], tris(diphenyl- phosphino)methane [24] and HRuCo3(CO)n [4] were prepared according to published procedures. High pressure reactions A 100 ml stainless-steel autoclave was used as the reactor. In a typical run (Table 1, Run 4), Co2(CO)s (0.20 mg-atom), Ru3(CO)i2 (0.19 mg-atom), cyclohexene (8 ml, 80 mmol) and THF (10 ml) as solvent were charged into the reactor under nitrogen atmosphere. The autoclave was closed and then pressurized to 80 kg cm\"2 with CO'.H; = 1:1 at room temperature. Agitation was begun and the autoclave was heated to 110 C within 20 min. The reaction was allowed to proceed at that temperature for 4 h, and the initial rate was determined by measuring the pressure drop at the early stage of the reaction, the time-dependence curve of which is shown in Fig. I. After the 36 reaction, the autoclave was rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the pressure was slowly released. The autoclave was opened, 5 mmol of toluene was added as an internal standard, and the liquid phase was analyzed by gas chromatography. The conversion of cyclohexene was 55% and cyclohexane- carbaldehyde (1) was formed in 52% yield based on the cyclohexene initially added. The yields of cyclohexane and cyclohexanemethanol were less than 1%. Gas chromatographic analyses Gas chromatographic analyses were performed on a Hitachi 163 in- strument with a flame ionization detector using a 3 mm 0 X 3 m PEG-20M column (PEG-20M (20%) on Chromosorb W, 60 - 80 mesh, N3 gas 20 ml min\"').

Hydroformylation and hydroesterification of olefins by homogeneous cobalt-ruthenium bimetallic catalysts Masanobu Hidai 2 Engineering Research Institute, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113 Japan 2 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Atsushi Fukuoka Yukio Koyasu Yasuzo Uchida Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku. Tokyo 113 Japan The Co2(CO)8-Ru3(CO)12 bimetallic systems showed high catalytic activity for hydroformylation of olefins such as cyclohexene, 1-hexene and styrene, compared with Co2(CO)6 or Ru3(CO)12 alone. The hydroformylation by the bimetallic catalysts was remarkably influenced by the nature of the solvent used, and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol were the best among the solvents employed. Thus, the initial rate of the hydroformylation of cyclohexene with the Co2(CO)8-Ru3(CO)12 catalyst (Ru:Co=1:1) in methanol was nineteen times faster than that with Co2(CO)8, if the reaction was performed at 110 °C under CO:H2 pressure (40:40 kg cm−2 initial pressure at room temperature). The bimetallic systems were also effective for the hydroesterification of cyclohexene. The synergistic effect for cobalt and ruthenium on hydroformylation and hydroesterification is discussed.
