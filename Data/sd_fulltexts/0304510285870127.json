SCHROCK*, JOHN H. FREUDENBERGER, MARK L. LISTEMANN and LAUGHLIN G. McCULLOUGH Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 (U. S. A.) Summary Several types of tungstenacyclobutadiene complexes have now been isolated. Three have distorted trigonal-bipyramidal structures in which the WC3 ring system lies in the trigonal plane. One of them, W^Eta)- [OCH(CF3)2]3, has been shown to metathesize acetylenes by a reaction which is first order in both tungsten and acetylene. The structure and spec- troscopy of W075-C5H5)[C(Ph)C(CMe3)C(Ph)]Cl2 show it to contain a non- planar, localized WC3 ring which is fluxional in the NMR time scale, possibly by formation of a tungstenatetrahedrane intermediate. Many functionalized alkylidyne complexes have been prepared. Such complexes often decompose in the presence of functionalized acetylenes, but some are viable metathesis catalysts for functionalized acetylenes. Several examples of decomposition products, including a 'deprotonated' tungstenacyclobutadiene complex, are provided. Both molybdenum and rhenium neopentylidyne complexes can be prepared, but none so far has been shown to be a well-behaved acetylene metathesis catalyst. Finally, we have shown that W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 can be protonated by hydrogen halides or phenols to give neopentylidene com- plexes which, when pure, do not react readily with internal olefins. Introduction We have been studying reactions relevant to the metathesis of acetylenes by W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 for several years [1]. For example, we have shown that W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 reacts with diphenylacetylene at a rate that is first order in tungsten and first order in acetylene to produce W(CPh)(OCMe3)3 [2]. We have assumed that acetylene metathesis reactions in general consist of twice forming and breaking up a planar tungstenacyclobutadiene ring. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands Here we present some more recent results concerning the reactions of alkyli- dyne complexes which, among other things, suggest that this is an over- simplified point of view. Results Mechanism Although one might presume that tungstenacyclobutadiene complexes will be relatively rare, we have found that they are relatively common. The first one was obtained as the product of the reaction between W(CCMe3)Cl3- (1,2-dimethoxyethane) and dimethylacetylene [3]. In the roughly trigonal- bipyramidal complex the ring lies in the equatorial plane. The salient struc- tural features of the WCa ring are relatively short W C^ bond lengths (1.861(9) and 1.864(8) A), a short W-C^ bond length (2.115(8) A), relative- ly large W C^ R angles (R = Me or CMe^, 156.6(7) and 149.9(7) , respec- tively), and markedly different Cleq-W C^ angles of 124.5(3) (R = CMea) and 150.0(3) (R = Me). This complex will not metathesize acetylenes. It reacts further with 2-butyne to yield a 1:1 mixture of W^-CsMe^u^CLi (a dimer) and W(7?s-C5Me4But)(2-butyne)Cl2, both paramagnetic species, presumably by formation and disproportionation of intermediate [W(7^5-CsMe4But)Cl3L (not observable). More recently we have isolated two other stable tungstenacyclobuta- diene complexes [eqn. (1)]. 2EtC=CEt W(CCMe3)(OR)3(dme), r^cc^cit w(c3Et3)(OR)3 (1) where OR = 0[2,6-C6H3(Pri)2] (x = 0) or OCH(CF3)2 (x = 1) and dme = 1,2-dimethoxyethane. The structures of these complexes are virtually the same overall as that of W[C3(CMe3)Me2]Cl3 [4]. The diisopropylphenoxy complex will not metathesize 20 equiv of 3-heptyne at 25 C in several hours. This result is surprising in view of the fact that the initial 'metathesis' prod- uct, Me3CC=CEt, is ejected from the presumed intermediate WC3(CMe3)Et2 complex. The fact that 3-hexyne is not readily ejected from the WC3Et3 complex reveals the importance of steric factors in determining the stability of tungstenacyclobutadiene complexes. A W(C3Et3)(OCMe3)3 complex must lose 3-hexyne more readily than the tris(diisopropylphenoxy) complex, although we feel at this point that an additional electronic factor (the relative good ability of the t-butoxide ligand to donate IT -electron density to W) also contributes to the instability of the WC3Et3 ring. The hexafluoroisopropoxide ligand should, and we believe markedly does, increase the electrophilicity of the tungsten. Retention of dme in the fairly crowded coordination sphere of W(CCMe3)[OCH(CF3)2]3(dme) is good evidence. Apparently contradictory evidence is supplied by the fact that W(C3Et3)[OCH(CF3)2]3 will metathesize 3-heptyne in toluene at 25 C CP4 Fig. 1. ORTEP-II drawing of W(775-C5H5)[C(Ph)C(CMe3)C(Ph)]Cl3 with hydrogen atoms omitted. at a rate of several turnovers per minute. However, careful kinetic studies of the rate of incorporation of 3-hexyne-dio into W(C3Et3)[OCH(CF3)2]3 un- ambiguously indicate this reaction to be first order in both tungsten and acetylene over a wide concentration range (Aff* = 14.4(6) kcal moP1 AS* = 23(2) e.u.). Therefore, these results are consistent with a greater electrophilicity of the metal in the hexafluoroisopropoxy complex; it is electrophilic enough to add 3-hexyne, perhaps to form an intermediate tungstenabenzene complex. However, we hesitate to exclude other possibil- ities such as displacement of one acetylene in a twisted, localized tungstena- cyclobutadiene ring (see below) by another acetylene. There are two features of 'metallacycles' formed by adding acetylenes to W(T?5-C5Hs)(CCMe3)Cl2 that may eventually be exhibited in those that are catalysts for acetylene metathesis. The most important feature of the struc- ture of the complex obtained by adding diphenylacetylene to V^^^-CsHs)- (CCMe3)Cl2 (Fig. 1) is the nonplanar, localized WC3 ring [5]. The configura- tion of the ring is approximately halfway between a planar form (see above) and a chemically sensible tetrahedral form. Moreover (and this is the second important point), this 'tungstenacyclobutadiene' complex is apparently fluxional. The \"C NMR spectrum reveals only a single broad peak for the three-ring carbon atoms at approximately 200 ppm instead of two signals for a and j3 type carbon atoms at approximately 250 and 150 ppm. Functionalized alkylidynes and alkyne metathesis In general, it is difficult to metathesize functionalized olefins, probably primarily because the functionality effectively competes with the olefin for the electrophilic metal center. It should prove easier to metathesize function- alized acetylenes, since one might expect an electrophilic metal to more efficiently distinguish a triple bond from a o-donor functionality. Functionalized alkylidyne complexes can be prepared by adding difunc- tionalized acetylenes to V^OCM^e [eqn. (2)] [6], or monofunctionalized acetylenes to W(CEt)(OCMe3)3 [eqn. (3)]. (RO)3W^W(OR)3 + XC=CX ^ 2W(CX)(OR)3 (2) (X = CHzNEt^, CH^OSiMes) base W(CEt)(OR)3 + EtC=CX > EtC=CEt + W(CX)(OR)3(base)y (3) (X = CH=CH2, SiMea (y = 0); or X = COiMe, CH(OEt)z (y = 1)) In some cases the reaction is successful only in the presence of a nitrogenase base such as pyridine, or (especially) quinuclidine. The base blocks one type of coordination site on the alkylidyne complex, probably that trans to the axial alkylidyne in a trigonal bipyramid [7]. Note that in some cases the alkylidyne is directly functionalized. In general, however, W^CCH^Y com- plexes are more readily prepared and are apparently more stable thermally. This is most likely the reason why catalytic metathesis in general has not been successful when the functionality is directly attached to the acetylenic carbon, the exception being metathesis of trimethylsilylacetylenes. Among the more dramatic failures are the metathesis of terminal acetylenes, halo- or alkoxy-acetylenes, or any acetylene containing OH or CN functionalities. The successes include --CHzOSiIV^, CH^CO^Me, CHzCH^CHz and CH2NEt2 derivatives, in addition to the TMS derivatives already mentioned. In some cases we know why metathesis fails. For example, we know of several cases where 'deprotonated' metallacycles are formed, not only in systems which will not metathesize acetylenes [e.g., eqn. (4)] [8], but also in the t-butoxide system [eqn. (5)]. A proton in a tungstenacyclobutadiene * NEt. .A WCp(CCMe3)Clz + MegCC'CH \"- CpCIW^ (4) - NEt^CI Y CM63 W(CPh)(OCMes)s + PhC=CH * Jl^. (Me^CO)zpy,W^ (5) - Me^COH Y complex must be relatively acidic. In the first case [eqn. (4)] the product has been structurally characterized [8]. Halides in WC3 rings also apparently migrate readily [eqn. (6)]. Nitriles can react in a metathesis-like fashion as shown in eqn. (7), while an alcohol in most cases is likely to protonate the neopentylidyne ligand (see later). 5 W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 + EtC=CBr ^ (Me3CO)3(Br)W=C(CMe3)(C=CEt) (6) W(CEt)(OCMe3)3 + CH3CN > MeC=CEt +- [(Me3CO)3W=NL (7) x Molybdenum and rhenium The first homogeneous acetylene metathesis systems to be discovered contained molybdenum [9]. Although the nature of the catalyst in these systems was never elucidated we felt that Mo(VI) alkylidyne complexes were the most likely catalysts. We have now been able to prepare Mo(CCMe3)- (CH2CMe3)3 in poor but reproducible yield as shown in eqn. (8). This com- plex can be treated with HC1 in the presence of 1,2-dimethoxyethane to give Mo(CCMe3)Cl3(dme), from which several trialkoxide complexes Mo(CCMe3)- (OR)3 (OR = OCMe3, OPr1, OCHiCIV^) can be prepared straightforwardly. MoOzClz + 6Me3CCH2MgCl > Mo(CCMe3)(CH2CMe3)3 (8) (30-35%) Surprisingly, absolutely pure Mo(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 does not react readily with internal alkynes such as 3-heptyne, and 2-butyne and 3-hexyne are polymerized by Mo^CJV^XOPr^ and Mo(CCMe3)(OCH2CMe3)3. Occa- sionally 'Mo(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3' will react with RO=CR to yield ~ 5% Me3CC=CR. We suspect that some other Mo(VI) neopentylidyne complex is the one which reacts with RC=CR and are at present trying to identify it. We suspect the main problem is that Mo(VI) in Mo(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 is signifi- cantly less electrophilic than W(VI) in W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3. If more crowded coordination spheres are necessary in order to destabilize metallacyclobuta- diene complexes relative to alkylidyne complexes, polymers could arise by the rapid 'ring expansion' reaction as shown in eqn. (9). RC=CR RC=CR RC=CR MC3 >MCs -MC7 >etc. (9) Rhenium-based acetylene metathesis catalysts are unknown. However, one might expect Re(VII) alkylidyne complexes to be preparable, and per- haps catalysts for the metathesis reaction, if the d oxidation state is univer- sally the most desirable for metathetical activity. Recently we have shown that it is possible to prepare a series of Re(VII) complexes containing neopen- tyiidene and/or neopentylidyne ligands [10]. The starting complex is bis(t-butylimido)rhenium trichloride. It reacts with a neopentyl Grignard reagent to yield a neopentylidene complex [eqn. (10)]. The remarkable pro- tonation reaction shown in eqn. (11) yields a species containing only Re- carbon multiple bonds. Re(NCMe3)2CL, 3MeccH2Mgc1 Re(NCMe3)2(CHCMe3)(CH2CMe3) (10) Re(NCMe3 )2 (CHCMe3 )(CH2CMe3) 3 HC1 1/2 [Re(CCMe3)(CHCMe3)(NH2CMe3)Cl2]2 (11) The first complex that could be crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction was an iodo derivative, Re(CCMe3)(CHCMe3)py2l2. The neopen- tyiidyne and neopentylidene ligands are cis to one another, with short, but internally consistent M=C and M=C bond lengths of 1.742(9) and 1.873(9) A. The two pyridine ligands are coordinated trans to the neopentylidyne and neopentylidene ligands. None of the complexes mentioned so far reacts readily with ordinary olefins or acetylenes. One which we thought should is the di-t-butoxy derivative shown in eqn. (12). 2LiOCMe3 1/2 [Re(CCMe3)(CHCMe3)(NH2CMe3)Cl2L * Re(CCMe3)(CH2CMe3)(OCMe3)2 (12) However, it does not. We attribute this lack of reactivity to the presence of Tr-bonding ligands. Alkoxo, imido and oxo ligands, as well as alkylidene and alkylidyne ligands themselves, deactivate what should be an electrophilic metal center toward reaction with an olefin or acetylene. We are continuing to search for complexes having the right balance of electron-withdrawing, poor Tr-electron donors such as chlorides, and ff-bonding or Tr-electron- donating ligands. Alternatively, we hope to prepare a complex which is stable enough to survive temperatures at which the rate of reaction with olefins or acetylenes will be observable and well-behaved. Profanation of alkylidyne complexes We were surprised to find that [W^CJv^)^]\" does not react readily with HC1 to give W(CHCMe3)Cl4 [I], an often postulated type of alkylidene complex in olefin metathesis systems. We attribute this behavior to the in- ductive effect of the chloride ligands. In contrast, we found that oxo alkyli- dene complexes were stable species [11]. Furthermore, they can be prepared by adding one equivalent of water to neopentylidyne complexes [eqn. (13)]. Hid, NEt, [W(CCMe3)Cl4r ^ > Et3NHCl + W(0)(CHCMe3)(PR3)2Cl2 (13) 2PH.3 Analogous imido neopentylidene complexes can be prepared from amines and [W(CCMe^)Cl^]~ [12]. In this case well-characterized intermediate amido neopentylidyne complexes, e.g., W(CCMe3)(NHPh)(PMe3)2d2, could be isolated. Neopentylidyne complexes of the type W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 react with HX to yield neopentylidene complexes of the type described by Osborn et al. [13] [eqn. (14); X = Cl, Br, I]. W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 + 2HX > Me3COH + W(CHCMe3)(OCMe3)2X2 (14) Evidently two t-butoxide ligands, at least in a trigonal bipyramid in which they lie in the same plane as the neopentylidene ligand, are able to donate enough Tr-electron density to the neopentylidene a-carbon atom to prevent loss of an a-hydrogen atom as a proton. Analogous diphenoxy derivatives can be prepared similarly [eqn. (15)]. None of these species, when pure, re- acts readily with internal olefins. However, in the presence of AlCIa, internal olefins are rapidly metathesized. Presumably alkoxides are replaced by chlorides to yield a complex with a more electro philic, possibly actually cationic, metal center. We have no reason to propose that the reactions of the t-butoxide complexes mentioned here with Lewis acids differ except in detail from the reactions of the neopentoxy complexes Osbom et al. have described [13]. W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 + 2ROH > MeaCOH + W(CHCMe3)(OCMe3)2(OR)2 (R = C6Hs, CgFs, P-C6H4C1) (15) It now appears that olefins are metathesized rapidly only when the metal center is fairly electro philic. This will continue to be a significant problem if one wishes to characterize an efficient metathesis catalyst in detail, or to efficiently metathesize functionalized olefins. (Characterization will be difficult, because if the metal is electrophilic enough to react readily with olefins then it is also likely that the rate of rearrangement of alkylidene ligands bearing (3-protons (to olefins) and/or the rate of loss of an a-proton to produce an alkylidyne ligand becomes rapid.) As we have seen, neither characterization of an efficient catalyst nor metathesis of functionalized molecules is as problematic in the case of acetylene metathesis.

        "dc:description": "Several types of tungstenacyclobutadiene complexes have now been isolated. Three have distorted trigonal-bipyramidal structures in which the WC3 ring system lies in the trigonal plane. One of them, W(C3Et3)-[OCH(CF3)2]3, has been shown to metathesize acetylenes by a reaction which is first order in both tungsten and acetylene. The structure and spectroscopy of W(η5-C5H5)[C(Ph)C(CMe3)C(Ph)]Cl2 show it to contain a non-planar, localized WC3 ring which is fluxional in the NMR time scale, possibly by formation of a tungstenatetrahedrane intermediate. Many functionalized alkylidyne complexes have been prepared. Such complexes often decompose in the presence of functionalized acetylenes, but some are viable metathesis catalysts for functionalized acetylenes. Several examples of decomposition products, including a ‘deprotonated’ tungstenacyclobutadiene complex, are provided. Both molybdenum and rhenium neopentylidyne complexes can be prepared, but none so far has been shown to be a well-behaved acetylene metathesis catalyst. Finally, we have shown that W(CCMe3)(OCMe3)3 can be protonated by hydrogen halides or phenols to give neopentylidene complexes which, when pure, do not react readily with internal olefins.",
