The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the physicochemical properties of the CNTs and the prepared catalysts thereof. Cyclic volt- ammetry, liner current sweeping measurements, chronoamperometry measurements are employed to study the performance of the prepared catalysts. CNTs further treated with IMH H 2 O 2 solution (10s-on/20s-off, over five cycles) can be used as catalyst support, and exhibit sig- nificantly improved performance towards the methanol oxidation in comparison with other modified CNTs. The results represent a novel approach to functionalize CNTs in a simple and economic way. The method can also be applied in the mass production of nanosized ma- terials. Key words: fuel cell; carbon nanotube; functionalization; intermittent microwave heating method; methanol oxidation Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attract increasing interest as catalyst supports for low temperature fuel cells, due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as relatively high electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance in both acidic and basic media [1â€“3]. However, owing to their almost perfect structure, it remains a challenge to uniformly deposit metallic particles on the inert CNTs surface. Consequently, great efforts have been devoted to CNTs surface functionalization, to en- hance their activity and the interactions between the CNTs and the metallic particles. Techniques include, modifying CNTs with polymers [4,5], enlarging their surface area with KOH [6,7], and chemical treatment with agents such as O 3 , HCl, H 2 SO 4 , and HNO 3 [8,9]. CNTs surfaces can also be etched or functionalized with amine, carboxyl, and/or sulfone groups [10,11]. Liu et al. [12] employed a concentrated H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 mixture to cut highly entangled CNTs into shorter lengths, and thus produced numerous carboxyl groups at the open ends. Zhang et al. [8] investigated the efficiency of chemical oxida- tion upon the structure of CNTs using a range of oxidants. The pretreatment of CNTs may be necessary to finely disperse Pt particles on the surface. However, the above mentioned meth- ods are usually time-consuming, which make the procedures difficult to scale-up. Meanwhile, the treated CNTs tend to be hydrophilic, rendering them hard to filter. Therefore, to func- tionalize CNTs on a large scale, a time-saving and efficient method needs to be developed. HF-treated CNTs supported Pt catalysts show an enhanced activity and stability towards alcohol oxidation [13,14]. Mi- crowave irradiation has also been widely used for catalyst synthesis, due to its unique advantages in terms of heating efficiency and capacity [15,16]. In previous studies [17], we have combined the advantages of HF corrosion and intermit- tent microwave heating (IMH) to modify CNTs as catalyst supports. The modified CNTs supported Pt catalysts show an improved activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction compared with otherwise treated CNTs. Herein, CNTs func- tionalized with a IMH H 2 O 2 solutions are investigated in detail as catalyst supports, and their performance towards methanol YIN Shibin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 290â€“297 oxidation is studied. 1 Experimental 1.1 Carbon nanotubes pretreatment The proposed mechanism for CNTs modification is shown in Fig. 1. The HF solutions are used to make defects on the sur- face of the pristine CNTs. The IMH H 2 O 2 solution is then employed to produce functional groups upon the defects gen- erated in the first step. Finally, the obtained CNTs are used as catalyst supports. CNTs with diameters of 10â€“20 nm and purities >95% (Shenzhen Nanotech. Co., Ltd., China) were used as received. CNTs were initially treated with a HF solution as follows [14]: CNTs (1.0 g) were added to a 40 wt% HF solution (50 g) un- der continuous stirring for 6 h at room temperature. The treated CNTs were rinsed with neutral deionized water and dried at 80 Â°C under vacuum for 24 h. A portion of the treated CNTs was further treated with IMH H 2 O 2 solutions as follows: CNTs (500 mg) were added to a 10.0 ml 30 wt% H 2 O 2 solutions, and after stirring for 10 min, the mixture was microwave heated via a pulsing method (10s-on/10s-off, 10s-on/20s-off, and 10s-on/30s-off for five cycles). The resulting black samples were denoted as CNTs-1, CNTs-2, and CNTs-3. The CNTs treated with HF only were denoted as CNTs-HF. 1.2 Catalyst preparation The 20 wt% Pt/CNTs catalysts were easily and rapidly pre- pared using the IMH method as follows [15,16,18]: chloro- platinic acid, the starting precursor, was well mixed with eth- ylene glycol (EG) in an ultrasonic bath. CNTs were then added into the mixture. The pH adjusted to more than 10 using an NaOH/EG solution, and a well-dispersed slurry was obtained upon stirring and ultrasonication for 15 min. Thereafter, the slurry was microwave-heated 5s-on/5s-off over several cycles. Hydrochloric acid was then added. The resulting black solid samples were filtered, washed and dried at 80 Â°C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The corresponding catalysts are denoted as Pt/CNTs-1, Pt/CNTs-2, Pt/CNTs-3, and Pt/CNTs-HF. 1.3 Catalyst characterization Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measure- ments were carried out on all the CNTs samples using a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer (Thermo, USA). The Raman spec- troscopy measurements were performed on a Renishaw Ra- man spectrometer (Renishaw Corp., UK), using a He/Ne laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a D/Max-III (Rigaku Co., Japan), using Cu K radiation ( = 0.15406 nm), and operating conditions set to 40 kV and 20 mA. The 2 angular regions between 20Â° and 90Â° were explored at a scan rate of 10Â°/min and the 64Â°â€“72Â° angle range was finely scanned at 1Â°/min, to obtain the Pt crystal size according to the Scherrer formula [19]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were carried out on a JEOL JEM-2010 (HR) at 200 kV, to interrogate the particle size distribution of Pt within the cata- lysts. The histograms for the prepared catalysts were made by randomly measuring more than 300 particles. All electrochemical measurements were conducted on a PARETAT 2273 (Princeton Applied Research, USA) instru- ment in a thermostatically-controlled standard three-electrode cell at room temperature, adopting a saturated calomel elec- HF Corrosion Oxygen-containing Functional Groups Micropores & Defects Intermittent Microwave Heating H 2 O 2 Solution Fig. 1.

YIN Shibin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 290â€“297 trode (SCE) and a platinum foil (1 cm Ã— 1 cm) as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A glass carbon (GC) disk electrode with diameter of 5.0 mm was used as the substrate for the catalyst thin film in the electrochemical measurements. The thin film catalyst layer was prepared as the working electrode as follows: a mixture containing 5.0 mg catalyst, 1.8 ml ethanol and a 0.2 ml Nafion solution (5 wt%) was dispersed in a ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes to afford a well-dispersed ink. The catalyst ink was then quantitatively transferred onto the surface of a GC electrode using a micro- pipette. This was dried under an infrared lamp to obtain a catalyst thin film. The estimated catalyst loading was kept constant at 0.13 mg/cm 2 in this study. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were collected in 0.5 mol/L H 2 SO 4 aqueous solutions, with and without nitrogen saturated 1.0 mol/L CH 3 OH. All potentials are quoted in reference to the SCE. 2 Results and discussioQ The surfaces of the CNTs were characterized using FT-IR and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 2. The peaks at 1380 and 1635 cm âˆ’1 are assigned to the aromatic C=C stretching vibration and COOH group, respectively. The peak at 1730 cm âˆ’1 is assigned to the C=Oâˆ’ stretching vibra- tion within the COOH group. These peaks only appear after the CNTs are further modified with the IMH H 2 O 2 solution. It can therefore be deduced that the CNTs have been success- fully functionalized by the H 2 O 2 solution with high tempera- ture treatment. The corrosive action of the H 2 O 2 can be attrib- uted to its strong oxidizing nature, especially under the mi- crowave conditions. Microwave heating can rapidly heat the reaction system to a relatively high temperature. It is well known that in catalyst supports, oxygen-containing groups on the CNTs are beneficial because they enhance the hydro- philicity of the CNTs. This improves the dispersion of the catalysts. Meanwhile, they can also stabilize the metallic par- ticles by enhancing the bonding interactions between the me- tallic particles and the CNTs [7,17]. To further investigate the surfaces of the CNTs with different pretreatments, Raman spectroscopy was employed and the specific results are shown in Fig. 3. The samples share similar Raman scattering patterns. The peak at 1340 cm âˆ’1 is assigned to disordered graphite (D-line), and the peak at 1595 cm âˆ’1 corresponds to the splitting of the E 2g stretching mode of graphite. This reflects the structural intensity of the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atom, denoted as G-line. The intensity ratio between the D-line and the G-line can be used as an in- dicator for the structural integrity of the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms [20]. Based on the Raman curves, the intensity ratio of the D-line to the G-line is 0.79, 0.82, 0.91, and 1.15 for CNTs-1, CNTs-2, CNTs-3, and CNTs-HF, respectively. The CNTs-HF exhibits the lowest graphitization degree, which can be attributed to defects brought about by the HF [13]. Further treating the CNTs-HF with IMH H 2 O 2 , the graphitization de- gree increases. The high temperatures during the microwave treatment may consume portions of the disordered graphite. Meanwhile, the graphitization degree decreases with the re- laxation time. This is understandable, because the longer re- laxation time lead to relatively lower temperatures. On the other hand, shorter microwave irradiation off time can lead to a relatively higher temperature. Throughout this process, the disordered graphite is oxidized and decomposed, thus in- creasing the graphitization degree within the CNTs. There are levels of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surfaces of the CNTs, after further treatment with IMH H 2 O 2 [17,21], as confirmed from the FT-IR results. This is consistent with the above conclusion. Figure 4 presents the XRD results for the prepared catalysts. As displayed in the spectra, all the samples show the typical characteristics of a crystalline Pt face centered cubic fcc structure. The diffraction peaks at 2 = 39.6Â°, 46.3Â°, 67.4Â°, and 81.6Â° are assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of Pt, respectively. The fitted (220) plane is used to calculate the crystal size of Pt according to the Scherrer formula [19].

YIN Shibin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 290â€“297 average crystal sizes for Pt/CNTs-1, Pt/CNTs-2, Pt/CNTs-3, and Pt/CNTs-HF is 3.6, 3.3, 2.8, and 2.9 nm, respectively. This could be attributed to the existence of micropores and defects, which would increase the contact area between the Pt particles and the CNTs. This could efficiently inhibit the agglomeration of Pt particles [13]. Therefore, the Pt/CNTs-HF have the smallest crystal size. On the other hand, the level of micropores and defects would be consumed upon further treatment with IMH H 2 O 2 . Consequently, the crystal size for the Pt deposited on CNTs-1, CNTs-2, and CNTs-3 is larger than that for CNTs-HF. The TEM micrographs and corresponding particle size dis- tribution histograms for Pt/CNTs-2 and Pt/CNTs-HF are given in Fig. 5. As shown below, the Pt particles are uniformly dis- tributed on both catalysts. The Pt contents as verified by in- ductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Perkin-Elmer, Germany) are 83.51%, 83.97%, 83.66%, and 77.59% for Pt/CNTs-1, Pt/CNTs-2, Pt/CNTs-3, and Pt/CNTs-HF, respectively.

YIN Shibin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 290â€“297 particles. This may be attributed to the large number of oxy- gen-contain functional groups on the surface of CNTs-2, which can enhance the interactions between the Pt particles and the CNTs. Moreover, based on the 300 particles measured in ran- dom regions, the average particle sizes are estimated to be 3.2 and 2.8 nm for the Pt/CNTs-2 and Pt/CNTs-HF, respectively. The methanol oxidation performance of the prepared cata- lysts have been evaluated. Figure 6 shows the CV curves for the catalysts in 0.5 mol/L aqueous H 2 SO 4 , with and without 1.0 mol/L CH 3 OH. Upon integrating the hydrogen adsorp- tion/desorption charges according to the CV curves in Fig. 6(a), the electrochemical surface areas (ESA) of catalysts can be calculated. The charges, Q H , for Pt/CNTs-1, Pt/CNTs-2, Pt/CNTs-3, and Pt/CNTs-HF are 4.50, 4.73, 4.04, and 3.35 mC/cm 2 . The Pt/CNTs-2 have the largest ESA, which is 41.19% higher than those measured for Pt/CNTs-HF. The corresponding peak current densities for the methanol oxida- tion are proportional to the ESA, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The Pt/CNT-2 exhibits the best activity and the specific peak cur- rent density is 41.65% higher than that for Pt/CNTs-HF. We also integrated the anodic peak density for methanol oxidation during the forward potential cycles at different scan rates. The relationship between peak current density and scan rate for Pt/CNTs-2 and Pt/CNTs-HF are displayed in Fig. 6(c). The peak current density for both catalysts increases with increasing scan rate. However, the Pt/CNTs-2 has a larger slope compared with Pt/CNTs-HF and shows a better activity to- wards methanol oxidation. The effect of temperature on the electrode was studied using Tafel plots with a scan rate of 1 mV/s. Figure 7(a) summarizes the effects of temperature on the electrode activity. The over-potential at the same current density decreases with in- creasing temperature. The exchange current densities, j 0 , at different temperatures are obtained by extrapolating the linear Tafel lines to where the over-potential equals zero. j 0 is then plotted against 1/T, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The activation free energy can then be calculated according to the Arrhenius for- mula [22]: Logj 0 = logK â€“ G 0 /(2.3RT) (1) where G 0 is the reaction activation free energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and K is a factor depending on the concentration.

YIN Shibin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 290â€“297 Pt/CNTs-HF catalysts, respectively. This reflects an improved rate for methanol oxidation on the Pt/CNTs-2. Table 1 sum- marizes the exchange current densities for the methanol oxi- dation on both Pt/CNTs-2 and Pt/CNTs-HF. For the methanol oxidation, resistance to CO poisoning is also very important, since the CO-like by-products generated during the oxidation can occupy the Pt active sites and con- sequently decrease their activity towards the desired oxidation [23]. Linear current sweeping measurements were employed to investigate the CO poisoning-resistance for all the prepared catalysts and the corresponding results are summarized in Fig. 8. Potential oscillation is a typical phenomenon for Pt, because of poisoning by the CO-like by-products generated throughout the dehydrogenation of methanol. The highest potential oscil- lation was observed for Pt/CNTs-2, and the order for all the investigated catalysts follows the sequence of Pt/CNTs-2> Pt/CNTs-1>Pt/CNTs-3>Pt/CNTs-HF. We believe that this high stability predominantly originates from the improved graph- itization and functionalization of the CNTs. These enhance the interaction between the Pt particles and the CNTs. To further investigate the stabilities of the catalysts, chronoamperometry measurements were used by holding the potential at 0.35 and 0.60 V for 3600 s. The changes in the oxidation current with time were recorded. As shown in Fig. 9, the oxidation currents decreased continuously for all the cata- lysts, presumably due to catalyst poisoning via the by-products formed throughout the oxidation of methanol. Any adsorbed SO 4 2âˆ’ anions on the surface of the Pt could also inhibit the methanol oxidation reaction [24]. At 0.35 V, in the region of activation polarization, the Pt/CNTs-2 possess the highest current density. All the prepared catalysts follow the order of Pt/CNTs-2>Pt/CNTs-1>Pt/CNTs-3>Pt/CNTs-HF. Similarly, at 0.60 V, which is approaching the region of peak potential, the Pt/CNTs-2 is also able to maintain the highest current density of all the catalysts. This further supports its superior catalytic performance. This may be attributed to the stronger metal-support interactions between the Pt particles and the CNTs. 3 Conclusions A method to efficiently functionalize CNTs as Pt catalyst supports via a combined HF corrosion and intermittent mi- crowave heating strategy, using H 2 O 2 solution, has been de- veloped and demonstrated. The sample prepared using a 10s-on/20s-off pulsing protocol over five cycles has been employed as catalyst supports and exhibits the best activity towards methanol oxidation among those in this study. It also shows a significantly improved stability towards the methanol Table 1 Comparison of the exchange current densities for methanol oxidation on Pt/CNTs-2 and Pt/CNTs-HF electrodes at different tempera- tures.
