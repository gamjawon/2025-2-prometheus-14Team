Supported and unsupported noble metal oxides (PtO^, IrOz, RuO; and their mixed oxides) have been used exten- sively for this purpose [1-7]. Homogeneous catalysts, such as simple Co(II) salts [4, 8] or amine complexes [9], diaquobis(bpy)Ru(II) [10] or a diaquo- /x-oxo dimer of Ru(III) [II], have also been used with variable success. We wish to report here an Os-based molecular catalyst, covalently linked to a mineral surface. This type of catalyst is clearly of interest for the photo- chemical cleavage of water or for any energy-storing photoreaction which requires the transformation of oxidizing equivalents into oxygen. Our catalyst was prepared by (i) grafting a vinyl group on sepiolite, a high surface area fibrous clay; (ii) adding osmium tetroxide to the carbon- carbon double bond, and (iii) mildly reducing the product in hydrogen at 473 K. Magnesian layer lattice silicates bearing surface Si OH groups, such as sepiolite, can indeed be easily covered with vinyl groups by reaction with methylvinyldichlorosilane (MVDCS) in organic solvents [12]. The mecha- nism involves elimination of HC1 and formation of Si 0 Si linkages between the mineral surface and the organosilyl groups. As evidenced by laser microprobe mass analysis (LAMMA), the resulting grafted species are either monomeric (1) or polymeric, the dimer (2) being the dominant species [13]. We used a natural, micronized sepiolite from Vallecas, Spain (Pangel, Tolsa S.A.) with a nitrogen BET surface area of 340 m2 g\"1. We closely fol- lowed the grafting procedure developed by Ruiz-Hitzky and Fripiat [14]. Ten g of sepiolite were suspended in 250 ml of benzene containing 5 ml of MVDCS and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature.

Osmium addition was performed by suspending the grafted sepiolite (2.4 g; 0.65 mM methylvinylsiloxyl groups g~1) in a solution of Os04 (1.5 mM) in CCl4 (200 ml), according to the procedure of Barrios et al. [15]. After 1 h stirring, the black solid was centrifuged, washed repeatedly with CCl4 in order to eliminate any unreacted Os04 and air-dried. The osmium content of the final material was 7 wt.%; yield: ~70%) and its sur- face area ~250 m2 g~1). It should be pointed out that the same procedure applied to an untreated sepiolite leads to a totally Os-free material. IR examination of the Os sepiolite (OsS) shows, as expected, a drastic decrease in the intensity of the bands assigned to r(CH) of the vinyl group (3060 and 3020 cm\"1). TEM reveals rows of black dots (~10 A) parallel to the longitu- dinal axis of the fibers. These dots most probably correspond to a few (pre- dominantly two) osmium atoms on adjacent methylvinylsiloxyl groups. The ability of the OsS to catalyze the photo-oxidation of water was tested in a classical three-component system [5] (sensitizer: Ru(bpy)32\"1\"; sacrificial acceptor: Co(NH3)5C12+; catalyst: OsS) at pH 4 (50 ml phosphate or phthalate buffer). The reaction was performed in a therm ostatted (298 0.5 K) stirred reactor, irradiated with a 600 W tungsten-halogen lamp through a 10 cm water filter. The gas phase was periodically expanded in a classical gas-handling system for injection into a GC. The results are shown in Fig. 1A, where the Oz/N^ ratio in excess of the normal ratio in air is plotted. We show also, for the sake of comparison, the results obtained with the same amount (0.08 mM metal) of a standard catalyst, namely RuO; or RuO; deposited on an untreated sepiolite by decomposition of Ru04. The follow- ing conclusions can be drawn: (i) OsS without further pretreatment has no detectable activity, whereas supported RuO; is already very active; (ii) activation in oxygen or air is ineffective with OsS whereas it improves the activity of supported RuOz, as already reported by others, with an optimal 86 A- -- \" - 3.6 7.2 10.8 TimefIC^s) Fig. 1.

Activation of OsS in oxygen in fact oxidizes the organic groups to carbon dioxide and volatilizes the Os04, leaving a white, Os-free sepiolite; (iii) thermal reduction by Ha is effective for producing an active OsS catalyst, but the reduction must be moderate. A temperature of 473 K (5 h) is adequate, but 573 K (15 h) is already too severe. On the other hand, we have already reported that clay-supported Ru metal, obtained by reduction of RuOa at 773 K in H;, is as active a catalyst as the oxide [16]. All these observations show that the nature of the OsS catalyst is different from that of conventional noble metal oxides. Interestingly, the oxygen content of the gas phase reaches a maximum after ~1 h, although the evolution of gases extends over longer periods of time (3 - 4h). Actually, the GC analyses show that the reaction produces not only oxygen, but also nitrogen, with the OsS as well as with the RuO; cata- lysts. A typical example is shown in Fig. 2. 0^ is first produced, and N; later. We have already reported this observation for the photo-oxidation of water with diaquobis(bpy)Ru(II) catalysts [10], and have assigned it to the oxidation of the ammonium ions generated by the decomposition of the reduced acceptor, Co(NH3)sCl\"1\". This phenomenon is surprisingly undocu- mented in the literature, and clearly deserves more attention. The volumetric determination of the amount of hydrogen consumed during reduction shows that 1.0 0.1 mol H; (mol Os)~1 is necessary to generate the active form of the catalyst. Thus, a two-electron reduction is involved. Since the oxidation state of the starting material is most probably 86 7.2 10.8 14.4 time (W's) Fig. 2. Time course of the O^ (0) and N2 (n) GC peaks from the analysis of the gas phase produced by the photo-oxidation system described in the text (catalyst : sepiolite-RuO^). Os(IV) [15], this suggests that aquo-Os\" species may be generated by the pretreatment (3). The OsS catalyst is not especially active, as compared to supported RuOz for instance (Fig. 1C). Actually, the interest of OsS lies in the fact that it is, to our best knowledge, the first example of a molecularly dispersed water-oxidation catalyst grafted onto a colloidal support. This opens the way to more complex systems mimicking the function of photosystem II reaction centers (with a sensitizer and a catalyst co-grafted onto the same surface). References 1 J. Kiwi and M.
