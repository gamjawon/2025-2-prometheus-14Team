Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands Received 30 November 1993; revised 10 June 1994; accepted 7 July 1994 Abstract Alumina modified by various fluorine containing compounds has been studied in reactions of n- butene. Combination of the results thus obtained with pieces of information from the literature leads to the following model. Skeletal isomerization takes place on Lewis acid sites as a monomolecular conversion, while on a catalyst with BrCnsted acid sites the bimolecular mechanism can prevail. Experiments with higher alkenes support this picture. Keywords: Alkene; Alumina (modified); BrCnsted acid sites; Isomerization (skeletal); Lewis acid sites 1. Introduction It is well known that fluorination of alumina dramatically changes its catalytic properties. A detailed review on earlier papers on this subject is available [ 1,2]. The changes in catalytic properties induced by fluorination are related to changes in the total number of acid sites and their acidity. Fluorination increases the total number of the acid sites and their acid strength [ 3-18]. The literature teaches us that from a certain concentration up, a further increase in the fluorine content results in an increase of the number of BrCnsted sites but a decrease in the number of Lewis acid sites. One can make use of this knowledge and identify the active centres for different reactions, by following the changes in the product patterns as a function of the extent of fluorination. Identification o~ active sites, if successful, is by no means a purely academic question. Several patents show that fluorinated alumina is a promising [ 19-21 ] catalyst for skeletal isomerization of n-butene. The last mentioned reaction could supply an important intermediate (iso-butene) for the * Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 31-71 ) 274250, fax.

We have explored the effects of halogenation of alumina in our recent paper [ 22] and confirmed the literature concerning the positive effect of halogenation. Fluorinated alumina appeared to be in particular interesting from the mechanistic point of view. The main ideas in the literature concerning the mechanism can be summarized as follows: (1) The carbenium ion mechanism [ 23-26], which with n-butene unavoidably involves the primary carbenium ions; the BrCnsted acid sites are the most likely active sites. (2) Isomerization through an 7r-allylic intermediate, with Lewis (or Lewis acid/ Lewis base pair-) sites as active centres (see ref. [22] for a review). (3) A conversion of alkoxy intermediates, possibly formed with the aid of acidic OH groups (BrCnsted acid sites) [22]. (4) Intermediates mentioned under ( 1 ) and (2) could induce a so called bimo- lecular mechanism, by which the butene is first oligomerized and thereafter 'cracked' [25,26]. Forming of a large isomerizing intermediate first (C4 ~C8, C12) circumvents the necessity of the primary ion formation. By using differently modified alumina catalysts and by monitoring the product distributions with different alkenes (butenes, n-pentene, hexene and octene) in the feed, one has a potential source of information on the mechanism. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals The used alkenes are n-butene (Koeloos 99.9%), iso-butene (Messer Griesheim 99%), n-pentene (Janssen 97%), n-hexene (Janssen 97%) and n-octene (Janssen 95%). Alumina (boehmite) of a high purity from Akzo (Ketjen Catalyst) was calcined at 600 in air for 6 h. This produced a pure y-A1203 with a BET specific surface area of 180 m2/g and pore volume 0.52 ml/g. Two compounds, NHaF (Janssen 98%) and CF3COOH (Janssen 99%) were used as fluorination agents. A commercial aluminium fluoride AIF3\" H20 (Janssen 97%) was studied in the reaction of n-butene. 2.2. Catalyst preparation Two different methods could be used to prepare fluorinated alumina, either impregnation of alumina at room temperatures with the aqueous solution containing an appropriate content of fluorine, followed by drying and calcining at high tem- perature, or vapour phase fluorination by passing vapour of a fluorine containing (in-)organic compound over alumina heated to a temperature within the range 100-500. In the second procedure, the exact amount of F in the catalyst is not Z.-X. Cheng, V.

The nominal values by which the different catalysts are identified below, were calculated under assumption that all fluorine added to or led over the alumina compound was retained by the catalyst. The first type of alumina catalysts were prepared using an aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of NH4F corresponding to 1-30% F in alumina (Table 1 ), and a 2 h impregnation at room temperature. The impregnating volume was fixed to 2 ml solution for 1 g alumina. Then, the catalysts were pre-dried at 120 to remove the solvent (water) and heated to 450 for 1 h in a flow of nitrogen. In this preparation, we followed the prescriptions in the literature [ 10,11,18] and relied on the information in the literature concerning the charac- terization of these catalysts. Another catalyst consisted of alumina chemically treated by CF3COOH vapour in nitrogen for different times (Table 2) at 350, at which CF3COOH is easily decomposed into several fragments and reacts vcith the alumina surface. By decom- position the total flow-rate grew from 1.3 1/h up to 1.5 1/h. No X-ray diffraction lines related to aluminium fluoride were observed with the product, even with the sample treated for 50 rain. It indicates that the aluminium fluoride when formed from CF3COOH is highly dispersed on the alumina surface and is of very small crystallite size [ 12,17,18]. 130 Z.-X. Cheng, V.

Activity study The reaction was carried out at 350 and atmospheric pressure in a conventional flow reactor. The catalysts were first pretreated in the reactor under nitrogen flow, and then the diluted alkene in nitrogen was used as a feed. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard), using a KC1/A1203 column which was temperature-programmed at 100 for 15 min and at 180 for 30 min (40/min). Details of the experimental procedure and data evaluation have already been described [ 22]. 3. Results 3.1. Reaction of n-butene over alumina modified by NH4F The reaction was followed at the standard temperature of 350, with diluted n- butene (5 % n-butene in nitrogen, 20 ml/min flow-rate, 1 g catalyst). A first analysis was always performed at 0.5 h on-stream (hereafter time-on-stream is abbreviated as z). Then, water was introduced, for example at ~-= 3 h over 3% F/A1203 (Table 1) into the feed (saturated vapour pressure at 20) and analysis performed at ~-= 4 h, with 1 h on-stream with water. The saturation of the feed by water was stopped at T= 4 h and product analysis performed at r= 5 h, with 1 h on-stream without water. After heating of the catalyst in nitrogen flow at 450 for 30 min, a product analysis was performed, after additional 0.5 h on-stream without water, at r=5.5 h. Table 1 shows the product analysis at indicated ~\"s. The fifth column shows which degree of equilibration has been achieved with respect to iso-butene (only butenes are considered in this calculation). We observe here that regardless of the Z.-X.

Selectivities to iso-butene and to various by-products as determined at ~-= 0.5 h are clearly functions of the 'F'-content in the catalyst. In particular, the production of by-products can be enhanced by an increasing 'F'-content, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that the mentioned selectivities (iso-butene, by-products) are also functions of the time-on-stream, ~'. In particular, the selectivity to by-products varies in a pronounced way. An important fact to remember is that the by-products behave differently from iso-butene in Figs. 1 and 2. We shall return to this point in the discussion. 3.2.

All results shown are obtained again at the standard condi- tions and temperature of 350. It is interesting to see the differences in behaviour of differently modified alu- minas: NH4F-modified and CF3COOH-modified catalysts are rather similar when catalysts of different 'F'-contents are being compared, but they are different in the iso-butene production monitored as a function of the time-on-stream r. 3.3. Reactions of n-octene and iso-butene over fluorinated alumina To test the possible role of the bimolecular (dimerization-isomerization-crack- ing) mechanism, reactions of n-octene have been monitored with various fluori- nated alumina catalysts. The product distributions are collected in Tables 3-5. The catalyst with the lowest fluorine content ( 1% F) converts at standard con- ditions (in the example shown) 46% of all hydrocarbons, and 44% of all C8- hydrocarbons is hereby cracked into C3, C4 and C5 hydrocarbons. Cracking is almost fully suppressed by water. Only 4% of all C8 is converted and from the reacted n- Z.-X. Cheng, V.

Catalysts with a higher F-content are very active, have good cracking activity and the latter is less affected by water than it is with 1% F-alumina. Results obtained with alumina modified by CF3COOH are shown in the Table 4. In this case, alumina was treated by the modifier over a period of 40 min and thereafter the reaction was followed at the indicated temperatures. It is interesting to compare, at the very initial stage of reaction with n-octene (~'=0.5 h), the product distributions obtained Xvith n-butene on one side and isobutene on the other side. This has been done for the reaction temperature 350, and the alumina modified by CF3COOH (40 min dosing). The results are in Table 5. If we compare the product distributions obtained with n-butene, isobutene and n-octene, we observe a remarkable similarity (Table 5). Further, we can notice that 134 Z.-X. Cheng, V. Ponec /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 127-138 28 26 24 22 ~ 2o o. 16 \"6 14 ~'Ioi 8 6 4i 2 Fig. 5. n-Butene reaction /,II iso-butene ~ ~ ~ J J J f / Iv / / / / / ,/ / / f / 200 2~o '2;.o '2;o '2~o '36o 320 a4o aso reaction temperature over NIq4F-fluorinated alumina, selectivity as a function of reaction temperature. next to the products with a lower number of C-atoms (C3) there are also products with a higher number of carbon atoms (C5, C6, C7 and C8). By comparing Table 5 with the '10% F' entry of Table 3, we can see certain similarities between the reactions of n-butene and n-octene. This points to the possibility that a bimolecular mechanism of isomerization can operate here.

When undiluted n-butene is led at 1 bar pressure over the F/A1203 catalysts, a liquid is produced which condenses at cold parts of the apparatus or in a cooled trap. At the reaction temperature of 200, the liquid is colourless and contains about 80% of various oct(a)enes. At the reaction temperature of 350, the con- densed liquid is yellow, it contains about 5% of various oct(a)enes and a larger amount of higher (not all identified individually) hydrocarbons. With diluted n- butene (5% in N2), the total amount of oligomers and fragments of oligomers decreases with increasing reaction temperature. Fig. 5 shows the results for the NH4F-alumina; alumina treated with CF3COOH shows essentially the same picture. With regard to the oligomerization reaction, one more remark: Hydrocarbons C6 and C7 could be either formed by cracking of C8 (notice, splitting off of C1 and C2 is not very probable on theoretical grounds), or by dimerization of C3, recombi- nation of C3 + C4, etc. The second pathway is much more likely since amounts of C1 and Ca hydrocarbons were never on the level which would indicate formation of C6 and C7 by a direct cracking of C8. \"~ With all what has been already said, a conclusion seems to be fully justified that iso-butene can be formed for example via the sequence butene-+iso-octe- nes--+ isobutene. Then, naturally the problem arises, if that is the only pathway along which isobutene could be formed, or not? With regard to this problem, the information in Figs. 1 and 5 is most relevant and we shall address this point in the discussion. 136 Z-X. Cheng, V. Ponec /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 127-138 3.4. Reactions of n-pentene and n-hexene over the fluorinated alumina In an attempt to gain more insight in the mechanism, in particular with respect to the relative contribution of the mono- and bimolecular mechanism, we have also made a short exploratory study regarding the reactions of n-pentene and n-hexene. A feed with about 4% of the mentioned alkenes was led over the catalysts indicated in Tables 6 and 7 and the reaction was followed at the standard conditions (tem- perature of 350). Tables 6 and 7 show appreciable amounts of those products which could be considered as arising by the already discussed sequence of reactions: 'dimerization- isomerization-cracking'. The abundance of such products decreases with increasing time-on-stream ~-, and their presence is more visible with the alumina modified by CF3COOH, than with the NHnF-modified catalyst. Further, we could notice a relatively high ratio iso-pentene/all pentenes found in reactions with various feeds: n-butene, isobutene, n-pentene, n-hexene and n-octene. 4. Discussion Some smaller points have already been discussed, here we focus on the following ones: 1. a comparison of differently modified aluminas 2. overall mechanism and the nature of the active sites As regards point 1, let us have a look again at Fig. 1, where we see the variation in the by-products and isobutene formation upon the reaction of n-butene on NH4F- modified AI:O3, at standard conditions (350) and at ~'=0.5 h. Clearly, the influence of the extent of modification looks as if a part of the by-products was produced by different active sites than was isobutene. A similar conclusion could be made when inspecting Fig. 2. The existing information in the literature offers a hint on how to explain this behaviour. Alumina modified by NH4F is a good catalyst for isomerization of cyclopropane [ 4 ] and cyclohexene [ 12] and it is claimed that the active sites are here of the Lewis-type. A maximum in activity is found at low F-contents (2-3 wt.-%). In contrast with this, cracking (oligomerization is a reversed reaction of cracking) of cumene [ 13-15,27] or of 2,3 dimethylbutane [4] is found to proceed on Br0nsted sites and the maximum activity is then at higher F-contents, at about 10 wt.-% F. Thus, the results shown in Figs. 1-4 can be explained with the help of the above presented information from the literature: at low F-contents, the Lewis centres prevail; at higher F-contents the BrCnsted sites are important. The former ones are active in skeletal isomerization of n-butene, the latter are also active in oligomerization and cracking. In fact, the NH4F modified alumina is known to have Lewis sites of strong acidity but only few BrCnsted sites of strong acidity, at low F content 1% [ 16]. With this catalyst, an important production of isobutene is found here (19%), comparable to that seen with catalysts Z.-X. Cheng, V. Ponec /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 127-138 137 of higher F-content. When the fluorine content increases mainly the production of by-products increases (Fig. 1). Increasing the fluorine content from 1 to 10% produces, according to the literature, more Brcnsted acid sites of strong acidity [ 18]. A further increase of fluorine content, from 10 to 20%, decreases the number of Br~nsted acid sites because of bulk AIF3 ( > 5 nm) formation [ 18 ], and the total volume of by-products decreases here accordingly (Fig. 1 ). Each cracking on strong acidic Br~nsted sites is accompanied by some coking of the catalysts. This would explain the changes observed with time-on-stream (Figs. 2 and 3) and their differ- ent character for isobutene and by-products. Catalysts modified by CF3COOH show a higher activity and a more pronounced formation of by-products, including hydrocarbons higher than C4 (compare Fig. 1 with Fig. 2). Another important point to be noticed is that water strongly deactivates the NHnF-fluorinated alumina for isobutene production (Table 1), while the CF3COOH-fluorinated alumina has a better resistance against water deactivation for the production of iso-butene (Table 2). We are inclined to ascribe this difference to the different spreading of fluorine over the alumina surface. It has been reported that gaseous HCF3-fluorination of alumina at temperatures 400-500 leads to a better dispersion of A1F3 over alumina than the impregnation by NHnF solutions [171. As regards point 2, it is mainly the modification of alumina by CF3COOH which makes the formation of all by-products so clearly visible. This observation stimu- lated the subsequent study on the comparison of reactions of n-butene, isobutene, n-pentene, n-hexene and n-octene on the same catalyst and under the same conditions. The results can be summarized as follows. With fluorinated alumina, in particular with catalysts produced by CF3COOH-treatment, two pathways lead from n-butene to isobutene. One, called a mono-molecular mechanism, should be somehow related to the Lewis acidic sites or Lewis acid/base pair sites (see point 1 ). The other, called the bimolecular mechanism (dimerization ---> isomerization cracking) must involve also the BrCnsted acid sites. The product distributions (C6, C7 without C1 and C2, and a higher than 'equilibrium' concentration of iso- butene) strongly support the second mentioned pathway, the bimolecular mecha- nism. However, the behaviour of low-F-content catalysts (Fig. 1) indicates that the monomolecular mechanism is always important. If our assignment of the active sites and their relation to the mechanism is correct, the results presented by this paper indicate in which way the modification of alumina would control the relative contributions by individual mechanisms to the overall conversion. The reader should notice that, for example, chlorination leads to more Lewis sites [22], while a severe fluorination produces more BrOnsted sitas [ 18].
