Better supports for the electrocatalysts are needed to carry out the reactions successfully and give a longer lifetime for the electrocatalysts. An ideal carbon support should have a high specific surface area, good electric conductivity, suitable pore size, favorable surface functional groups, good corrosion resistance, and low cost. Much work has been done on developing new carbon materials and modifying the carbon materials by pretreatment with acid, alkali, oxidant, or polymer to meet these requirements. In this work, commercial carbon supports that include the widely used carbon black Vulcan XC-72R, acetylene black, black pearls 2000, Printex XE-2, and Ketjen Black EC were briefly reviewed. New carbon materials such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, ordered porous carbon, mesocarbon microbeads, carbon nanohorns, carbon nanocoils, and carbon aerogels were reviewed in detail. These new carbon materials generally give better performance due to their special structure, better crystallinity, and faster mass transfer when compared to the commercial materials, and carbon nanotubes demonstrated the best performance up to the present time. Key words: direct alcohol fuel cell; electrocatalyst; carbon nanofiber; carbon nanotube; ordered porous carbon; carbon nanocoil; carbon na- nohorn The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has the advantages of high specific energy density and quiet, non-polluting, and easy operation. DMFC can be expected to become the power sup- plies for portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, cameras, etc. [1] DMFC has been extensively inves- tigated with regard to the selection and preparation of the electrocatalysts, synthesis and modification of the proton ex- change membrane, optimization of the electrode structure, and integration of system [2 4]. In recent years, studies at world famous companies such as NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi, Samsung, MTI, and Motorola have developed and demonstrated the use of mobile phones and laptops powered by a DMFC. It is be- lieved that DMFC can be commercialized soon. However, DMFC in an industrialized process still must confront three major scientific challenges. First, the methanol oxidation re- actions catalyzed by present anode electrocatalysts are not fast enough. Second, the proton exchange membrane has a low proton conductivity and methanol crossover from the anode to cathode throughout the membrane. Third, the cathode catalyst for the oxygen reduction process does not give a fast enough reaction and is poisoned by methanol. Therefore, the devel- opment of anode and cathode electrocatalysts with high activ- ity and good stability is still needed. 1 Comercial carbon materials To improve the catalytic activity, stability, and utilization of the catalyst, the active component is usually dispersed on a support. Carbon materials are the best choice as the electro- catalyst support because of their large specific surface area, strong corrosion resistance, and low price. The most widely used carbon material is Vulcan XC-72R, which is a kind of carbon black material produced by Cabot Corporation in the United States. Its BET surface area is 250 m 2 /g, mesopore and TANG Shuihua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 12–17 macropore percentage is 54%, and electric conductivity is 2.77 S/cm, which can basically meet the requirements of a support for an electrocatalyst. At present, XC-72R is regarded as the best commercial electrocatalyst support and is used by 80% of electrocatalysts. Other commercial carbon materials such as Black Pearls 2000, Acetylene Black, Ketjen Black, and Macsorb have also been studied, but their performance is not as good as that of XC-72R. The catalytic activity can be improved to some degree by surface modification, micropore enlarge- ment or blockage, etc. These were believed to improve the hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties of the carbon surface and electron, proton, and mass transfer in the electrocatalytic reactions. The physical properties of these commercial carbon supports are shown in Table 1. Electrocatalytic reactions in DMFC involve three-phase re- actions such as solid, liquid, and gas phase transport and elec- tron and proton transfer. An ideal carbon support should si- multaneously possess high specific surface area, good electric conductivity, suitable pore size, and good corrosion resistance and can support necessary surface functional groups to guar- antee that the reactions occur continuously and that the elec- trocatalyst has a longer lifetime. Specifically, the metal loading of the electrocatalyst should be no less than 40%, which re- quires that the carbon support should have a large specific surface area to give a good dispersion of the active components and a high activity and good stability for the catalysts. The specific surface area of an ideal electrocatalyst support should be between 400 and 600 m 2 /g. For the reactants and products to have access to the active sites and escape from the surface, it is also required that the carbon support must have sufficient mesopores or macropores and an appropriate morphology. In addition, electrocatalytical reactions demand that the carbon supports have good electronic conductivity (graphitization degree) to reduce the electrode resistance and also to protect the carbon support from being oxidized. Suitable surface functional groups are also needed to act as anchors for the noble metal particles during catalyst preparation, which would improve the lifetime of the catalyst and the dispersion of the active components. The activated carbon XC-72R still cannot satisfy these demands for an ideal electrocatalyst support, even though it is the best commercial support. Therefore, the de- velopment of new carbon materials and modification of exist- ing ones are of concern. The high conductivity, high specific surface area, and a large amount of mesopores or macropores are conflicting require- ments, so it is a big challenge to get carbon materials with excellent properties. The design and development of excellent carbon materials will be difficult. Since 1998, there have been a variety of new carbon materials such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), ordered porous carbon (OPC), mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs), carbon nanohorns (CNHs), carbon nanocoils (CNCs), and carbon aerogels (CAGs) that have been investigated as electrocatalyst supports in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, and some impressive results have been achieved. Here, the application of these carbon materials in DMFC is reviewed in detail. 2 New carbon materials 2.1 Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) In 2001, Bessel et al. [5] used various types of graphite carbon nanofibers (GCNFs), such as platelet, ribbon, and her- ringbone, as catalyst supports. A 5% Pt was supported on these three types of GCNFs and XC-72R. Pt on platelet and ribbon type GCNFs exhibited improved oxidation activity of 400% when compared with that of XC-72R support in methanol oxidation. Furthermore, the GCNFs-supported metal particles were observed to be significantly less susceptible to CO poi- soning than the traditional catalyst systems. This improvement in performance is believed to be because the metal particles adopt specific crystallographic orientations when dispersed on the highly tailored GCNFs structures. However, herringbone type GCNF-supported Pt exhibited very low electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation, which was explained by that its hydrophilic nature interfered with the performance of the metal catalyst. However, Steigerwalt et al. [6,7] have prepared a Pt-Ru/herringbone GCNF nanocomposite using a single source molecular precursor as the source of the metal. This nano- composite had been used as an anode catalyst in working DMFC, and the fuel cell performance was enhanced by 50% relative to that with an unsupported Pt-Ru colloid anode cata- lyst. A Pt-Ru/narrow tubular herringbone GCNF nanocompo- site showed the highest performance in a DMFC. This per- formance was equivalent to that recorded for an unsupported Pt-Ru colloid at an anode metal loading of 2.7 mg/cm 2 , and Table 1 Physical properties of various commercial carbon supports Carbon material Supplier Category Specific surface area (m 2 /g) DBP a /Unit Vulcan XC-72R Cabot furnace black 250 190 Black Pearls 2000 Cabot furnace black 1500 330 Ketjen EC-300J Ketjen Black furnace black 800 360 Ketjen EC-600JD Ketjen Black furnace black 1270 495 Shawinigan Chevron acetylene black 80 — Denka Black Denka acetylene black 65 165 a DBP: Dibutyl phthalate number (measure of carbon void volume). TANG Shuihua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 12–17 64% better than that of the unsupported Pt-Ru colloid at a lower anode metal loading of 1.5 mg/cm 2 . In a later work, highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles were electrodeposited on GCNFs by Tang et al. [8]. The highest mass activity for methanol oxidation reached 323 A/g when a Pt/GCNFs/graphite electrode was cycled at a scan rate of 50 mV/s by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 2 mol/L CH 3 OH +1 mol/L H 2 SO 4 aqueous solutions. At very low Pt loading (8.79 g/cm 2 ), the Pt/GCNFs/graphite electrodes still exhibited high oxidation activity (129.5 A/g) and good stability. The loss of the catalytic activity after 500 cycles may be caused by the consumption of methanol, poisoning and structural change of the platinum nanoparticles, or by the perturbation of the potentials during the scanning in aqueous solutions. After the Pt/GCNTs/ graphite electrode was stored in double-distilled water for 24 h, the peak current density can reach 55.4 mA/cm 2 again, which was higher than that at the end of long term cycling and 91% of the value of the maximum peak current (60.94 mA/cm 2 ). Guo et al. [9] used oxidized carbon nanofibers (OCNF) and reduced carbon nanofibers (RCNF) as supports to prepare highly dispersed 45% PtRu catalysts for the DMFC. Although PtRu/RCNF had a smaller particle size and more uniform distribution than PtRu/OCNF, both catalysts had very similar methanol oxidation peak current densities, which were sig- nificantly lower than that of the commercial catalyst. However, for single cell performance, the OCNF-supported catalysts gave a better performance than the commercial catalysts when the current density was higher than 50 mA/cm 2 . These results can probably be ascribed to the special surface and structural properties of the OCNF. 2.2 Ordered porous carbon (OPC) Much work has been carried out on OPC in the past years. The OPC was prepared using SBA-15 as the template and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor. It was first used in 2001 as a support for the catalyst for oxygen reduction [10]. The OPC has a specific surface area of 2000 m 2 /g as measured by the BET method. The amount of hydrogen chemisorption decreased with Pt loading, but the mass activity for oxygen reduction increased with Pt loading and reached a maximum at a Pt loading of 33%, and then decreased with Pt loading. At room temperature and a rotating speed of 10000 r/min in 0.1 mol/L HClO 4 solution saturated with O 2 , an OPC-supported Pt catalyst showed a surprisingly high peak activity of 100 A/g at 33% Pt loading, while carbon black (XC-72R, BET surface area of 250 m 2 /g), activated carbon (Darco KB, BET surface area of 1500), and activated carbon fibre (Osaka ACF A-15, BET surface area of 1500 m 2 /g) supported catalysts were re- ported to have peak activities ranging from 1.4 to 25 A/g at 900 mV under similar conditions. Thus, this OPC support can be a suitable catalyst support in a DMFC by its providing a favor- able morphology for the metallic catalyst clusters and an in- terconnected pore network for the facile transport of feed and product molecules. In another work, nanoporous carbon with a large surface area of 1300 m 2 /g was also synthesized by Nam et al. [11] using a SBA-15 silica template. It was successfully used as the catalyst support for Pt in a DMFC cathode. The single cell test exhibited reasonably good DMFC performance with 61 mW/cm 2 of maximum power density, 0.67 V of open circuit cell voltage, and a limiting current density of over 200 mA/cm 2 , which was slightly better than that with platinum black with similar operation parameters. Yu et al. [12] and Chai et al. [13] have reported the synthesis of uniform porous carbon replicas with some interesting morphological variations (pore sizes in the range of 10 to 1000 nm) with a colloidal spherical silica template by inducing different polymerization processes of phenol and formalde- hyde for the carbon precursor. The porous carbons were used as the support for an anode catalyst in DMFC. The use of the ordered uniform porous carbons resulted in a much improved catalytic activity for methanol oxidation in the fuel cell. They ascribed this to the high surface area, large pore volume, and three-dimensionally interconnected uniform pore structure, which allow a higher dispersion of the catalysts and efficient diffusion of the reagents. Among the porous carbons studied in this work, that which had 25 nm pore diameter (PtRu-C-25) showed the highest performance with power densities of 58 and 167 mW/cm 2 at 30 and 70 o C, respectively. These values were 70% and 40% increases, respectively, over those of a commercial PtRu alloy catalyst (E-TEK). Chai et al. [14] synthesized a three-dimensionally inter- connected, ordered, and macroporous structure silica by drying a mixture of polystyrene and silica gel and subsequent calci- nation of the polystyrene. Later, the porous silica framework was impregnated with the carbon precursor divinylbenzene, and after polymerization and carbonization, a new type of periodically ordered, bimodal porous carbon (POBPC) was obtained. This three-dimensionally interconnected, ordered POBPC with surface area of 465 m 2 /g and pore volume of 132 ml/g was composed of macropores about 317 nm in diameter and mesopores about 10 nm in size. The macropores were uniformly surrounded by the mesopores. A POBPC-supported PtRu catalyst demonstrated a much better electrocatalytic performance than a commercial catalyst from E-TEK Com- pany with the same metal loading. The highest power densities were 70 and 190 mW/cm 2 for PtRu/POBPC at 30 and 70 o C, respectively, while the values were only 39 and 121 mW/cm 2 for PtRu/C (E-TEK). Calcined SBA-15 was immersed in an aqueous C 2 H 5 OH- H 2 O (volume ratio 1:1) solution containing (NH 3 )Pt(NO 3 ) 2 by Choi et al. [15]. After drying the slurry at 40 o C in a rotary evaporator and further evacuation in vacuo at 60 o C, the re- sulting mixture was dispersed in CH 2 Cl 2 and dried at room temperature to introduce the Pt precursor on the outer surface TANG Shuihua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 12–17 of the SBA-15 into the silica channels. The remaining pore volume of the SBA-15 was filled with sucrose and sulfuric acid to produce a PtC nanocomposite with Pt clusters located inside the micropores of carbon. This PtC catalyst showed a better electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction than Pt/CMK-3. In the comparison of this PtC catalyst with a commercial catalyst EC-20-PTC, at various methanol concen- trations and cell temperatures, the open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the PtC nanocomposite were 40 60 mV higher than that of EC-20-PTC. With 2 mol/L CH 3 OH at the anode, the current density of the PtC (112 A/g) was 190% that of EC-20-PTC at 810 mV (vs RHE). If 4 mol/L CH 3 OH was fed, the former was 340% that of the latter at 800 mV (vs RHE). This performance was explained by that a regular mesopore array decreased mass transfer resistance and tortuosity factors, which resulted in an increase in the effective diffusivity of small gas molecules and better dispersion of the Pt metal particles. Raghuveer et al. [16] synthesized a mesoporous carbon with a surface area of 890 m 2 /g and pore sizes of 10 50 nm. This carbon-supported Pt catalyst showed three times the electro- catalytic activity of that of Pt/XC-72R. This was attributed to the mesoporous carbon that had a larger specific surface area and was without micropores, which gave improved metal dis- persion and utilization. 2.3 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) CNTs have been of extreme attraction after their discovery by Iijima (NEC, Japan) in 1991. Multi-walled carbon nano- tubes (MWNTs) pretreated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid were used as supports for an oxygen reduction catalyst in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell by Li et al. [17] in 2002. The diameter of the MWNTs ranged from 4 to 50 nm, and the specific surface area was 42 m 2 /g. When 10% Pt/MWNTs was prepared as the oxygen reduction catalyst, up to 107 mW/cm 2 of peak power density was achieved, while only 70 mW/cm 2 was produced with a 10% Pt/XC-72R under similar conditions. The CNTs showed a much better performance than XC-72R, which was probably due to their unique structure, good elec- tron conductivity, and strong interaction between the Pt parti- cles and CNTs. When iron was added, the metal particle size of the PtFe/MWNTs catalyst increased to 7.0 nm compared with the 4.5 nm of Pt/MWNTs, but the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction was better [18]. This was explained by that Fe 3+ ion at the catalyst surface can effectively facilitate the decomposition of the intermediate H 2 O 2 formed in the oxygen reduction reaction. However, the iron was easily lost in the strong acid solution and strong electric field, so the method of catalyst preparation has to be improved. The metal particle size and performance of the catalyst can be controlled by tuning the ratio of water to ethylene glycol. The electrocatalytic activity was best with a water content of 5% and metal particle size of 2.6 nm. PtFe/MWNTs catalysts were prepared by a modified polyol synthesis method in an ethylene glycol solution, and then heat-treated under 10%H 2 /Ar at different temperatures (300 and 900 o C). The PtFe/MWNTs pretreated at 300 o C ex- hibited a higher oxygen reduction activity and better per- formance than the as-prepared catalyst and the catalyst pre- treated at 900 o C when used as the cathode in a direct methanol single cell test [19]. Liu et al. [20] obtained a higher yield of functionalized CNTs by the treatment of CNTs in HNO 3 or H 2 SO 4 -K 2 Cr 2 O 7 . The Pt nanoparticles and nanoclusters were deposited on these functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes by electroless plating. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the Pt/CNT electrocatalysts contained 67.3% of Pt 0 and 32.7% of Pt(IV). Pt/CNTs prepared by the deposition of Pt after SnCl 2 sensitization and PdCl 2 activation of the carbon nanotubes demonstrated a much better activity for oxygen reduction than the Pt/CNTs catalyst prepared by the direct deposition of Pt. A Pt electrocatalyst was electrochemically dispersed on CNTs by He et al. [21]. An excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/CNTs/graphite electrodes for methanol oxidation (A Q , defined by peak current density per unit of Pt deposition charge) was observed even at a low platinum deposition charge (Q = 1.24×10 �4 C/cm 2 ). At Q = 3.72×10 �3 C/cm 2 , the highest elec- trocatalytic activity of the Pt/CNTs/graphite electrode reached 4.62 A/C and was about 2.3 times higher than that of a Pt/graphite electrode. After a cycle number of 500, a 40.1% loss of the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode was ob- served. When the Pt/CNTs/graphite electrode was restored in double-distilled water for 24 h, the peak current density was recovered to 12.21 mA/cm 2 , which was 71% of the maximum value (17.3 mA/cm 2 ). Li et al. [22] prepared 20% Pt/MWNTs catalysts by reflux- ing MWNTs in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids (1:1 v/v) at 90 °C for 5 h using a zwitterionic surfactant 3-(N,N-dimethyldodecylammonio) propanesulfonate (SB12) as the stabilizing agent and methanol as the reducing agent. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalyst are shown in Fig. 1. The Pt particles were very well dispersed on the pretreated MWNTs with an average particle size of 2.2 nm, but the performance of the catalyst was only slightly better than a 20% Pt/XC-72R. 2.4 Mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) MCMBs can be isolated from heat-treated pitch by extrac- tion with a proper solvent according to their solubility differ- ence. Carbon black is a kind of soft carbon, but MCMB is different from carbon black. Liu et al. [23] defined it as a kind of hard carbon. The pores of MCMBs can be kept open during the preparation of electrodes, which will facilitate mass trans- fer in the electrocatalytic reaction. Sample MCMB(A) was heated at 750 o C in air for 2 h, sample MCMB(B) was boiled in TANG Shuihua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 12–17 potassium hydroxide solution for 1 h, and MCMB as-received was named sample MCMB(C). Catalysts Pt/MCMB(A), Pt/MCMB(B), and Pt/MCMB(C) were prepared, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma measurements showed that the contents of Pt in the catalysts with the MCMB supports of A, B, and C were 16.4%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively. This in- dicated that the support pretreatment had a large influence on the adsorption of Pt on the supported catalysts. The heat treatment and boiling in the KOH solution increased the active sites on the surface of the MCMBs for the adsorption of platinum. The Pt particle size of the three catalysts was about 3.7 nm from the X-ray diffraction data. The results indicated that the techniques used for catalyst support pretreatment had little influence on the platinum grain size, but had a large in- fluence on the diffraction peaks of Pt. The catalyst with MCMB(B) as support showed the highest catalytic activity while the catalyst with MCMB(C) as support showed the highest polarization performance. Yang et al. [24] further used hard carbon spherules (HCS) as the support for a Pt catalyst. The electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation was better than those of the MCMBs-supported Pt catalyst and commer- cial catalyst Pt/XC-72R. 2.5 Single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) The carbon nanohorn is a special member of the carbon nanotube family. It easily aggregates to form 100 nm clusters. Its outstanding advantages as a catalyst support in fuel cells lie in having a very large surface area and also easy gas perme- ability into the horns. As compared with CNTs, it further has the advantage that it can be purified more easily. SWNHs were used as the support for the electrocatalyst in a micro-fuel cell by NEC Company in Japan in August 2001. The single cell performance was improved significantly and the energy ca- pacity reached 10 times that of the lithium ion battery. Ac- cording to a report in Small Times, NEC will corner the fuel cell market through the SWNHs. Besides NEC Company, Yoshitake et al. [25] prepared SWNHs by using laser ablation. Pt particles were supported on the SWNHs by a colloidal method. NaHSO 3 and H 2 O 2 were added to a H 2 PtCl 6 solution to form Pt oxide colloids, then the SWNHs powder was put into the Pt oxide colloid dispersion, and the Pt oxide colloids were adsorbed on the surface of SWNHs. After eliminating Cl – , Na + , and SO 4 2– ions, the sam- ples were dried and reduced in H 2 . Pt particles were homoge- neously dispersed on the SWNHs with particle sizes of about 2 nm. The current density of the fuel cell made from these SWNHs was higher than that with carbon black. Yuge et al. [26] pretreated SWNHs in concentrated nitric acid at temperatures of 25 and 130 o C to pierce through the walls of SWNHs. The surface area increased from 310 to 500 and 1200 m 2 /g, respectively. The Pt particle sizes were 1.5 2.5 nm in the interior of the nanohorns, and the Pt particles were spherical and were located near the defects. Pt particles ad- sorbed outside the SWNHs were not spherical. The mass ac- tivity for methanol oxidation for Pt deposited in the horns was much lower than that of Pt deposited on the outside of the SWNHs. At 0.55 V (vs NHE), the methanol oxidation activities for Pt(outside)/SWNHs and Pt(inside)/SWNHs were 22.5 and 5.5 A/g, respectively. This was probably because methanol molecules have difficulty reaching the surface of the Pt parti- cles inside the SWNHs. 2.6 Carbon nanocoils (CNCs) Hyeon et al. [27] and Park et al. [28] synthesized CNCs using resorcinol-formaldehyde gel as the carbon precursor and a mixture of cobalt and nickel salts as the catalyst for graph- itization during carbonization and by simple heat-treating of the composites containing a carbon precursor and adding a Fig. 1.

(a) (b) TANG Shuihua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 12–17 silica sol to facilitate pore formation. The CNCs-supported PtRu catalyst showed very good electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. It exhibited a substantially higher specific oxidation current of 80 A/g at 0.4 V (vs NHE) near the kineti- cally controlled potential in the methanol reaction. This can be compared with 20 A/g for the XC-72R-supported PtRu cata- lyst and 14 A/g for the E-TEK-supported PtRu catalyst at 25 o C. At 30 o C and 0.6 V, the current densities of the CNCs-supported catalyst, XC-72R-supported catalyst, and E-TEK-supported PtRu catalyst were 20, 5, and 1 mA/cm 2 , respectively. In addition, the CNCs-supported catalyst pro- duced a higher maximum power density at 30 o C, which was 70% and 130% higher than that of the XC-72R-supported catalyst and the commercial catalyst, respectively. At 60 o C, the maximum power density of the CNCs-supported catalyst was 46% and 80% higher than that of the XC-72R-supported catalyst and the commercial catalyst, respectively. The 60% Pt-Ru/CNCs catalyst had a good PtRu particle dispersion with an average particle size of ca. 2.3 nm, which was approxi- mately that of the commercial catalyst. The remarkably higher oxidation current of the CNCs-supported catalyst was directly related to the high surface area of 318 m 2 /g, well-defined po- rosity, and good crystallinity, which basically met the re- quirement for an ideal support for the electrocatalyst in DMFC. This was by far the carbon support with the best performance for methanol oxidation in DMFC. When using the same carbon precursors and graphitization catalyst but without silica, hollow graphite nanoparticles (HGNP) were synthesized [29,30]. The surface area of HGNP was only 88 m 2 /g, and the PtRu/HGNP catalyst showed a slightly lower catalytic activity for methanol oxidation than the PtRu/CNCs catalyst. 2.7 Carbon aerogels (CAGs) CAGs were synthesized by the polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde in neutral or weakly alkaline conditions to form aerogels. These were then carbonized to obtain the carbon material. The process is similar to that for CNCs. The structure and properties of both CAGs and CNCs were closely related to the amount of catalyst, but the catalysts were different. CAGs used anhydrous sodium carbonate while CNCs used cobalt and nickel salts. Smirnova et al. [31] prepared Pt/CAGs catalysts with vari- ous metal loadings and studied the electrochemical surface area and single cell performance for oxygen reduction under dif- ferent operating conditions. Pt/CAGs showed a better catalytic performance and higher open circuit voltage than the com- mercial catalyst. Furthermore, its Tafel slope was close to the theoretical value, and the electrochemical surface area was two times that of the commercial catalyst. The catalyst supported on CAGs (pore size of 20 nm) with low Pt loading (0.1 mg/cm 2 ) showed a maximum power density close to 0.8 mW/cm 2 in air at ambient pressure. This was possibly due to the better penetration of Nafion particles into the pores of the aerogel carbon support and better coverage of the membrane surface with the lower Pt content catalyst. 3 Conclusions and prospect In order to improve the proton transport capacity in an elec- trocatalytic reaction, Nafion solution was added into the cata- lyst slurry during the preparation of the catalyst ink. The proper amount of Nafion ranged from 10% to 30%. The addition of Nafion can improve proton transport capacity, but it will in- evitably cover some of the catalyst active sites, thereby re- ducing the utilization of the precious metals. To improve the utilization of the precious metal catalysts, the modification of the carbon support is also another useful approach. This not only improves the transport capacity of protons but also re- duces the amount of Nafion, which can reduce the cost of the fuel cell. Furthermore, with regard to the carbon support for the oxygen reduction catalyst, in order to allow the product (water) to be quickly and effectively removed from the active sites, and reactant (oxygen) to access the active sites, the carbon supports are required to be hydrophobic. On the contrary, the methanol oxidation catalyst needs a certain degree of hydrophilic support. These can be achieved by the modification of the carbon sup- port. By the combination of the development of new carbon materials and modification of the support, it can be possible to get an ideal support for electrocatalysts. The commercial carbon support, such as Vulcan XC-72R, has a relatively large surface area, good electrical conductivity, and proper particle size. However, the metal particle size in- creased rapidly with metal loadings of 40% or more, which is a drawback for DMFC, because in DMFC, a higher metal load- ing is used to give a better performance. Carbon nanofibers and multi-walled carbon nanotubes have relatively small surface area, large diameter and high aspect ratio. It will be very dif- ficult to prepare a catalyst with a very high metal loading of more than 40%. Another issue is the poor dispersion of the catalyst in ethanol. Therefore, modifications must be carried out to reduce the wall thickness, improve the surface area, and change the surface functional groups. A more important issue is that the approaches to prepare the anode and cathode catalysts should be varied with the different carbon supports, which have different specific surface areas, pore sizes, electronic properties, structures, and morphologies. The development of proper approaches for catalyst preparation with different supports will be of great importance in the future. References 1 Arico A S, Srinivasan S, Antonucci V.

Tel/Fax: +86-411-84379063 Electrocatalytic reactions in direct alcohol fuel cells involve solid, liquid, and gas phase transport and electron and proton transfer. Better supports for the electrocatalysts are needed to carry out the reactions successfully and give a longer lifetime for the electrocatalysts. An ideal carbon support should have a high specific surface area, good electric conductivity, suitable pore size, favorable surface functional groups, good corrosion resistance, and low cost. Much work has been done on developing new carbon materials and modifying the carbon materials by pretreatment with acid, alkali, oxidant, or polymer to meet these requirements. In this work, commercial carbon supports that include the widely used carbon black Vulcan XC-72R, acetylene black, black pearls 2000, Printex XE-2, and Ketjen Black EC were briefly reviewed. New carbon materials such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, ordered porous carbon, mesocarbon microbeads, carbon nanohorns, carbon nanocoils, and carbon aerogels were reviewed in detail. These new carbon materials generally give better performance due to their special structure, better crystallinity, and faster mass transfer when compared to the commercial materials, and carbon nanotubes demonstrated the best performance up to the present time. 摘要 电催化反应过程涉及固、液、气传输以及电子和质子传导,䜕为确保反应的顺利进行和提高催化剂中贵金属的利用率及延长催化剂的寿命,䜕理想的电催化剂载体必须同时具备高比表面积、导电性好、合适的孔结构、耐腐蚀以及合适的表面基团等.䜕䜕为此,䜕碳载体的改性工作受到关注,䜕常用的方法是通过酸、碱、氧化和高分子等手段改变载体的结构和表面性质,䜕以期接近理想电催化剂载体的要求;䜕䜕同时在开发新型碳载体方面做了更大量的工作.䜕䜕本文简要评述了商品炭载体如碳黑䜕Vulcan XC-72R䜕以及其它的乙炔黑、黑珍珠-2000、Printex XE-2䜕和䜕Ketjen Black EC䜕等碳材料在直接醇燃料电池中的应用,䜕但对纳米碳纤维、碳纳米管、有序多孔碳、中间相碳小球、碳纳米角、碳纳米卷和碳气凝胶等新型碳载体则进行了较全面的评述.䜕䜕与商品碳载体相比,䜕新型碳载体在一定程度上都表现出比䜕XC-72R䜕更优的性能,䜕这主要是因为新型碳材料具有特殊的结构、更高的结晶性能䜕导电性䜕和更好的传质能力.䜕 Graphical abstract Carbon black Vulcan XC-72R is the most widely used support for electrocatalysts, but better carbon supports are also required.
