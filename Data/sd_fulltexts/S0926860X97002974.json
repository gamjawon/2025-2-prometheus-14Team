NizP207 is the most selective catalyst with the iso-butene selectivity reaching to a maximum value of 82.2% at 550:C. Ag4P207 and Zn2PzO7 are also effective, but the iso-butene selectivities were slightly lower than that of NizP207. Pyrophosphates of Mg, Cr, Co, Mn, and Sn catalyse the oxidative dehydrogenation, but the iso-butene selectivity was 43.8-65.7% at the temperature where the maximum iso-butene yield is observed. The optimum oxygen concentration for iso-butene formation was 5-15 tool%, but the increase in O2 concentration did not increase the iso-butene selectivity. No adsorbed oxygen species was found by means of TPD. The lattice oxygen of the pyrophosphates began to react with H2 at 200-400. Reactivity of the lattice oxygen of pyrophosphates can be estimated from the value of AH~! for the corresponding oxide. More than 2 desorption peaks were observed in the TPD spectra of NH3 adsorbed on the pyrophosphates, and a linear correlation was found between the concentration of acid amount of the catalysts and the specific rate of iso-butene formation. This strongly suggests that the acidic sites play a key role in the iso-butene formation. :('~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. Keywords.

While propane and butanes, which are major components of petroleum gas, are now in use as fuel, production of iso-butene from its corresponding alkane, iso-butane, will be much more important in the near future. Many studies on the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes have been carried out [1-13] and some com- mercial plants are now in service. However, many problems, such as carbon deposition on catalyst, short catalyst life, and limitation of conversion due to chemical equilibrium, still remain. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 :~': 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

During the last decade, a number of studies on the catalytic oxidation of lower alkanes over various catalysts such as Mg-V-O [14,15], V2Os/y-A1203 [16], Pt/Ceramic foam [17], Ago.olBio.85Vo.54-Moo.4504 [18,19], Bi- Mo-O/TiO2 [20], B-P-O [21], V2Os/A1NbO4 [22], V2Os/TiO2 [23] and ZnFe204 [24] have been carried out. In general, alkanes tend to be oxidized comple- tely, and it is quite difficult to stop the oxidation at intermediate stages corresponding to olefin, alcohol, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or ketone formation. Cata- lyst exhibiting high selectivity and adequate for practical use has not been found so far. We had been investigating the partial oxidation of n- butane [25,26] and propane [27,28], and have reported the promotion mechanism of Zn added into V-P-O catalysts, and the promotion effect of La203 into (VO)2P207. This paper reports the oxidative dehydrogenation of iso-butane over the metal pyrophosphate and phos- phate catalysts, the reactivity of lattice oxygen of various metal pyrophosphates, and participation of the acidic property of the catalysts in the reaction. mple furnace t mules )2 wool & water Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the reaction apparatus. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Metal phosphates and pyrophosphates were pre- pared by the following procedure. An aqueous solu- tion of sodium pyrophosphate was added into an aqueous solution of metal nitrate or chloride with stirring and the precipitate formed was separated by filtration. The precipitate was adequately washed with pure water and then dried at 130 overnight. The catalyst powder calcined at 600 for 5 h in air was pressed into pellets and then crushed into 14-32mesh granules. X-ray Diffraction Analysis revealed that the catalysts calcined at 550 for 5 h were pyrophos- phates except for Cr salt, which is amorphous. 2.2. Apparatus Catalytic reaction was carried out using an ordinary flow type reaction system with a fixed catalyst bed, as shown in Fig. 1. The 14-32mesh SiC granules were charged in the lower part of the reactor to avoid the homogeneous reaction taking place in the post-cata- lytic volume. The reactant gas mixture composed of 75 mol% iso-butane, 5% oxygen, and 20% nitrogen as an internal standard was fed into the reactor. The reactant gas and effluent gas were analyzed by gas chromatography. 2.3. Temperature programmed desorption of 02 and NH3 TPD measurement was performed using an ordin- ary flow type apparatus equipped a glass U-tube (8mm id) sample holder. The sample, 0.5 g, was evacuated at 550 for 1 h and then approximately 100 torr 02 was introduced on the sample at 550. After 30 min exposure, the sample was cooled to ambient tempera- ture at a rate of 10/min. 02 which remained in the gas phase was replaced by He, then the temperature of the sample raised to 550 in a He stream of 30cc/min at a rate of 10/min. In the case of NH3, the sample evacuated at 550 for 1 h was cooled to ambient temperature in a vacuum and then NH3 gas was Y Takita et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 49-56 51 introduced at 100 torr for 30 rain. Other procedures are the same as in the case of oxygen. 2.4. Temperature programmed reduction N2 gas containing 2 tool% of hydrogen was used as carrier gas in TPR measurement. The pretreatment of the sample is the same as in NH3TPD measurement. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Oxidation of iso-butane over various metal pyrophosphates In the complete oxidation of hydrocarbons over metal oxide catalysts, catalytic activity can be esti- mated from the bond strength between metal ions and lattice oxide ions. One of the indices of the activity of lattice oxygen is standard enthalpy of formation (AHf of metal oxides. It is thought that the partial oxidation requires moderately active lattice oxygen, because highly active oxygen would promote com- plete oxidation. Thus, one should examine the cata- lytic properties of metal phosphates in the oxidation of iso-butane. The results of the catalytic reaction over NizP207 are shown in Table 1. The reaction became steady-state within short duration, so the sampling of the produced gas was done at 30 rain after reaching the reaction temperature. A very small amount of iso- butane was reacted to give methacrolein, acetone, and iso-butene at 450. At 500, most of the oxygen was consumed and iso-butene formed selectively. Other major products were CO, CO2, propylene, and methacrolein. The selectivity of iso-butene increased to 82.8% at 550. The rates of CO and CO2 formation were found unchanged by the increase in reaction temperature from 500 to 550\"C, hence decreasing the selectivity of CO and CO2. The sum of the selectivities of iso-butane and propene which are raw materials of petrochemistry, reached to approxi- mately 90% at 550. This product distribution sug- gests that at least two reactions take place on the NizP207 catalyst.

It is well consistent with the high carbon recovery. It is clear from Table 1 that Ni2P207 is an excellent catalyst for olefin formation from iso-butane. The results over the other metal pyrophosphate catalysts are shown in Table 2. Zn2P207 and Mg2P207 were active for iso-butane conversion and showed the iso-butane conversion as high as 8.06 and 6.38% at 550, respectively. The selectivity of iso-butene over these catalysts was 60- 70% at 500-550 which was slightly lower than that over Ni2P207. The C3H6 selectivity reached to 16- 21% over both catalysts, which was 2-3 times larger than that over Ni2P2OT. Co2P207, Mn2P207, and Cr4(P207)3 showed moderate activity and the iso- butane conversion was 3.8-4.8% at 550. Although Table 2 Oxidation of iso-butane over metal pyrophosphates. the iso-butene selectivity exceeded 60% over Cr4(P207)3, it only reached 44-50% at 550'~C over Co2P207 and Mn2P207. Significantly high selectivity of C3H6, about 30%, was observed over Co2P207 at 55ff-'C. No high iso-butene selectivity was observed in the reaction over Cu2P207 and Sn2P207 at the above reported temperatures. Relatively high oxygenate selectivity was observed, but the deep oxidation into COx was promoted over these catalysts. As can be seen from Table 1 and Table 2, Ni2P.~O7 is the most excellent catalyst for oxidative dehydro- genation of iso-butane, and Ag4P207, MgeP207, and Co2P207 are suitable for both oxidative dehydrogena- tion and propylene by the catalytic cracking of iso- butane. Sn2P207 and Cu2P207 were less active for oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-butane.

Takita et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 49-56 53 These catalysts before reaction were examined by the XRD measurement to be the pyrophosphates. The structure of the catalysts after the catalytic reaction at 550 was not changed and no new crystalline phases other than original pyrophosphates were observed. These results are consistent with the findings that only part of the lattice oxygen on the surface of Ni2P207 can participate in the oxygen equilibration with gas phase oxygen using l*O as a tracer, which will appear in the following manuscript. It is concluded that NizP207 is the best catalyst among metal pyrophosphates for oxydative dehydro- genation of iso-butane under the conditions of low oxygen concentration and high iso-butane concentra- tion. 6 t-- -~ 4 6 \"5 .-~ 2 >- 0 0 i , , i , i 1'0 1'5 2'0 Concentration of 02 (mol%) 15 O 10-~\" O 6- 5 0 3.2. Effect of the oxygen concentration Most of the catalytic oxidation of olefinic hydro- carbons was carried out using a feed gas of low hydrocarbon concentration, and under the reaction conditions where the hydrocarbon converted comple- tely to avoid the recycle of unreacted hydrocarbon. However, utilizing low hydrocarbon concentration, parafinic hydrocarbon tends to be oxidized to COx over these pyrophosphate catalysts. For this reason, the hydrocarbon concentration as high as 75 mol% and low oxygen concentration were adopted in this study, As can be seen from Table 1 and Table 2, the oxygen fed was almost completely consumed on these catalysts except for Co2P207, as the oxygen concen- tration in the feed would strongly affect the oxidation of iso-butane. The effects of 02 concentration on the iso-butane conversion and the yield of iso-butene formation are shown in Fig. 2. The iso-butane conversion increases almost linearly with the increase in oxygen concen- tration up to 21 mol%. The yield of iso-butene also increases linearly up to 15 mol% 02 but lower rate of increase is observed between 15 and 20% O2. Fig. 3 shows the effects of initial oxygen concentration on the product distribution over the Cr4(P207)3 catalyst. The selectivity of oxygenated products increases by 10% from 5 mol% to 10 mol% O2 and compensatively that of COx decreases. The selectivity of iso-butene was found to be slightly decreasing with the increase in oxygen concentration up to 15 tool%. The product Fig. 2.

When the feed gas contains 21 mol% 02, the iso-butene selectivity was about 47%, which is about 10% smaller than the previous oxygen concen- tration. 54 Y. Takita et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 167 (1998) 49-56 It can be concluded from these results that the increase in the oxygen concentration can increase the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation without chan- ging selectivity, so the optimum concentration exists between 5-15 tool% from a view point of the produc- tion of oxidatively dehydrogenated products from iso- butane, 3.3. Activity of lattice oxygen of pyrophosphates Lattice oxygen ions and/or adsorbed oxygen species should in principle participate in the oxydative hydro- genation of iso-butane. In order to investigate this, Temperature-Programmed-Desorption (TPD) of oxy- gen of metal pyrophosphates was utilized. No de- sorption of oxygen was observed up to 550 from all catalysts used in the previous section, suggesting that these pyrophosphates have no oxygen species adsorbed on the surface. So the activity of lattice oxygen ions of the catalysts was evaluated by the Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR). TPR spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum from Cu2P207 catalyst consisted of at least 3 peaks: a peak i c Cu (20) Ag (10) Ni (10) ~ Or (5) ., Co (2) Sn (20) j Mg(0.5) Zn(0.5) , Mn (0.5) , , , ~ 100 200 300 4 0 5 0 TEMPERATURE ( ) Fig. 4.

The Ag4P207 catalyst gave one big reduction peak with a maximum at 350. (VO)2PzO7 also gave a large peak at >350. The TPR spectra of Fe4(P207)3, C02P207, Cr4(P207)3, and NizP207 consisted of a peak and a steep increase up to 550. In the case of Sn2P207, only an increase at higher temperatures was observed. Mg2P207, ZnzP2OT, and Mn2P207 gave small peaks. It is difficult to evaluate the activity of lattice oxygen, but tentatively the peak maximum temperature of the reduction located at the lowest temperature was plotted in Fig. 5 against the standard enthalpy of formation of corresponding metal oxides together with the data of phosphates of Ce and La. As can be seen from the figure, there is a reasonable linear relation- ship between them. This suggests that the activity of the lattice of metal pyrophosphates can be estimated from the standard enthalpy of the corresponding metal oxides. The lowest peak top temperature in TPR spectra of the pyrophosphates was plotted against rate of iso- butane consumption rate at each temperature of 450 or 500 but no correlation was observed. The deep oxidation was promoted over the CuzPzO7 catalyst which give the largest TPR peak.

The effect of acidi~ of the catalysts lso-butane molecule has a tert-carbon atom so that tert-buthyl carbonium ions will form easily on the acidic catalysts such as metal pyrophosphates. So the acidic character of the catalysts was examined by means of TPD of ammonia. TPD spectra are shown in Fig. 7. The shape of the spectra was quite different from catalyst to catalyst. A desorption peak at <150 was observed in every spectrum. In addition to this, a desorption peak was observed at 200-300 in the spectra of Ag4P207, Co2P207, and Zn2P207. In the spectra of NizP207, Sn2P207, Cr4(P207)3, and Cu2P207, a clear desorption peak appeared at 300- 450. It seems that a small amount of desorption of NH3 continued at 300-500 over the Mg2P207 and MnzP207 catalysts. In the spectrum of Cr4(P207)3, the rate of NH3 desorption increased at >500, suggest- ing that this catalyst has strongly acidic sites.

Although some points deviated from the line, both indices are believed to correlate with each other. These results suggest that the acidic sites play a key role in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of iso-butane on the pyrophosphate catalysts.

Ni2P2O7 is the most selective catalyst with the iso-butene selectivity reaching to a maximum value of 82.2% at 550°C. Ag4P2O7 and Zn2P2O7 are also effective, but the iso-butene selectivities were slightly lower than that of Ni2P2O7. Pyrophosphates of Mg, Cr, Co, Mn, and Sn catalyse the oxidative dehydrogenation, but the iso-butene selectivity was 43.8–65.7% at the temperature where the maximum iso-butene yield is observed. The optimum oxygen concentration for iso-butene formation was 5–15 mol%, but the increase in O2 concentration did not increase the iso-butene selectivity. No adsorbed oxygen species was found by means of TPD. The lattice oxygen of the pyrophosphates began to react with H2 at 200–400°C. Reactivity of the lattice oxygen of pyrophosphates can be estimated from the value of ΔHf 0 for the corresponding oxide. More than 2 desorption peaks were observed in the TPD spectra of NH3 adsorbed on the pyrophosphates, and a linear correlation was found between the concentration of acid amount of the catalysts and the specific rate of iso-butene formation. This strongly suggests that the acidic sites play a key role in the iso-butene formation.
