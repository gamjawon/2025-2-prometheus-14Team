OGURA*, C. T. MIGITA and T. NAGAOKA Department of Applied Chemistry, Yamaguchi University, Tokiwadai Ube 755 (Japan) Summary Carbon dioxide has been reduced catalytically to methanol with an electrode mediator and homogeneous catalysts, using a hydrogen fuel cell as an energy source to regenerate the active mediator. Thennodynamic assessment predicts that the reversible potential for the reaction H++e~=^}l,i should be more negative than that for the reaction COg+GI^+Ge- =CH30H+rLiO whenever a fuel cell with hydrogen as the fuel and COg as the oxidant is feasible. As reaction proceeded, the pH of the catholyte rose but that of the anolyte dropped, until finally reduc- tion of COg ceased. Hence, adjustment of the pH values in both tempera- tures was necessary to maintain COg reduction over long time periods. Introduction although many methods for converting COg have been proposed in- volving hydrogenation utilizing homogeneous [1,2] and heterogeneous [3- 5] catalysis, and photochemical reduction [6, 7], electrochemical methods have been most widely investigated [8 -11]. In the electroreduction of COz, the major products reported to date include carbon monoxide, formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, methane and ethylene, whose formation is inde- pendent of the solvent and the nature of the electrode material employed [8]. In general, the electrochemical conversion of COg requires large over- potentials and is somewhat lacking in selectivity toward the desired product. For these reasons, research has been directed toward improving these weaknesses. We have developed a selective process for the conversion of COz to methanol using homogeneous catalysts and electrode mediators [12 -15]. The total reaction involved in COg reduction may be represented by the following equation: *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 277 COa+GR+SH^CHaOH+eO+HaO (1) 1:_______ 0+e-- R where R and 0 refer to the reduced and oxidized forms of the electrode mediator, respectively. Regeneration of the reduced form can be achieved by using external energy source to maintain reaction (1), with the mediator acting as an electron relay. Homogeneous catalysts are capable of making COg electroac- tive through the formation of a coordinated intermediate. In the present study the reduced form of the electrode mediator was regenerated by means of a hydrogen fuel cell, and problems arising during prolonged reaction were investigated. Experimental The reduction of COa was carried out with a fuel cell in which hydrogen and COg were used as fuel and oxidant, respectively. A platinum gauze (86.2 cm2) modified with Everitt's salt (ES, KzFe^Fe^ClSOg]) was used as the cathode. ES is the reduced form of Prussian Blue (PB, KFe^Fe^ClSOB]), and coating onto the substrate was performed by the electrochemical method [16]. The anode was a platinized platinum gauze (40.3 cm2), and the cathode and anode compartments were separated by a cation-exchange membrane. The electrode potential of the mediated cathode was measured versus the satu- rated calomel electrode. The catalyst solutions were 0.1 M KC1 solutions which included a metal complex and methanol. l-Nitroso-2-napnthol-3,6-disulphonatocobalt(II), [Co11- {CioH4(NO)(OH)(S03)2}2J, and aquapentacyanoferrate(II), Na3[Fe(CN)s- (H^O)], were used as the metal complexes. The initial pH value of the catalyst solution was adjusted to 2. The catalyst solution (300 cm3) was transferred to the cathode compartment and COg was bubbled during reaction. Methanol and water vapor evolved with exhausted COg were first cooled with a condenser and then trapped with water (2 C). The solution in the anode compartment was 300 cm3 of 0.1 M KaS04 at various pH values, and hydrogen gas was always frothed. The methanol produced was determined by both gas and steam chro- matographic methods. A JGC-1000 gas chromatograph equipped with a ther- mal conductivity detector and a Porapak Q column was employed. The sampling procedure has been described previously [15]. Quantitative analyses of the methanol passed from the cathode to the anode compartment through the ion-exchange membrane, and captured using the water trap, were per- formed by means of a steam chromatograph with steam as the carrier gas, using a flame ionization detector and a Porapak R column. 278 Results and discussion Figure 1 summarizes schematically the catalytic reduction of COg with a hydrogen fuel cell. The net charge transfer occurring at the anode and cathode are represented as reactions (2) and (3), respectively. 2 \"2 COa + GH-^ + 6e - -> CH30H + H^O (2) (3) As described above, the assistance of homogeneous catalysts and an electrode mediator is indispensable for the activation process depicted as reaction (3). Homogeneous catalysts M capture COg and convert it into an electroactive intermediate. This species is reduced to methanol by reaction with the reduced form R of the electrode mediator which is regenerated using the hydrogen fuel cell. Thermodynamic assessment predicts that the reversible potential of reaction (2) should be more negative than that of reaction (3) whenever a fuel cell with hydrogen as the fuel and COa as the oxidant is feasible. In the present study, the initial pH value of the catholyte was fixed at 2, and it was necessary that the pH value of the anolyte should be higher than 1.7. The reaction mechanism proposed is given in Fig. 2 where Everitt's salt was used as the electrode mediator [14,15]. The reduction of COg is induced by the oxidation of ES to PB: K^Fe'^Fe^C^g] -.KFe'^Fe^CN)^ + K^ +e- (ES) (PB) (4) - e- pte' ^\\ ^ 6H ^M-CO,\\ ACO^ Hg Pt2e-^ \\\" ^ | CH^IH H^O 2 Mediator Platinized Separator Anode Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the catalytic reduction of CO^ using a hydrogen fuel cell 279 CHgOH 2y+ HgO Fig 2 Reaction scheme for the reduction of COg (x=ES+H+;y=PB+H+). The metal complex capable of operating as a homogeneous catalyst should have a relatively high stability constant and at least one vacancy (really associated with a water molecule) in its coordination shell [14]. The position of the vacancy in the metal complex serves as the active site in the catalytic process. A coordination bond is first formed between the central metal and the primary alcohol, COg inserts into this bond and the coordi- nated species is reduced to methyl formate by reaction with ES. Methyl formate is further reduced to formaldehyde and MeOH, and finally to methanol, by ES. Gas chromatograms for the catholyte showed no accumula- tion of intermediates, methanol being the only product of the reduction reaction of CO^. In Fig. 3, the concentration of methanol formed and the electrode potential at the cathode are plotted as a function of the pH value of the solution in the anode compartment. As expected thermodynamically, COg is not reduced to methanol at pH values lower than 1.7. The formation of methanol increases as the pH of the anolyte is increased. This finding may be explained by the shift in the cathode potential to a negative value as the pH value of the anolyte increased. However, the yield of methanol formed decreased in the fuel cell as the anolyte became more alkaline, which is attributable to the lower solubility of the hydrogen gas and the slower oxidation rate for reaction (2). The results obtained for the reduction of COz with the hydrogen fuel cell on varying the initial pH value of the anolyte from 6 to 1.65 or 1.40 are shown in Table 1.

Reaction time, 5h. the concentration of methanol produced and the current efficiency for methanol formation (t]) are listed. Both metal complexes lead to the reduction of COg with relatively high current efficiency. The current efficiencies are higher with anolytes of higher pH values in the hydrogen fuel cell, with no formation of methanol at pH values of 1.65 and 1.40. As the reaction advanced, the pH of the catholyte rose while that of the anolyte dropped, until finally COz reduction ceased. This, in order to achieve prolonged reduction, it was necessary to regulate the pH values in both compartments. The concentration of added metal complex affects methanol formation in the manner listed in Table 2. An increase in the concentration of the metal complex results in an increase in COg reduction and leads to higher current efficiency. This effect is more conspicuous in the presence of l-nitroso-2-naph- thol-3,6-disulphonatocobalt(II) than aquapentacyanoferrate(II), because the activity of a metal complex as a homogeneous catalyst is related to the value of its stability constant [14].

The pH values of the catholyte and anolyte were regulated to cc. 2 and 6 by adding concentrated HC1 and KOH solutions, respectively, every 10 h. from experiments in which the pH values of the anoltye and catholyte were adjusted to ca. 2 and 6 by adding concentrated HC1 and KOH solutions, respectively, every 10 h are depicted. The molar ratio exceeds a value of unity after 110 h, while the molar ratio versus reaction time curve is concave suggesting that the reduction of COa is catalytic. The electrode mediator used here suffered no degradation during reaction. Thus, COa can be reduced catalytically to methanol using a hydrogen fuel cell. However, adjustment of the pH values in both compartments is required in order to maintain COg reduction over prolonged periods of time. References 1 B. D. Dombeck, Adv. Catal., 32 (1983) 325. 2 J.
