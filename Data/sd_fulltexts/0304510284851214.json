RAFAELOFF, Y. HARUVY, G. BARUCH, I. SCHOENFELDand L. A. RAJBENBACH Pure and Applied Radiation Chemistry Department, Soreq Nuclear Research Centre, Yavne 70600 (Israel) (Received May 14, 1983; accepted October 26, 1983) Summary Recoverable platinum catalysts anchored to a polymer film were pre- pared by subjecting to 7-irradiation nylon-acrylamide copolymer films immersed in aqueous solutions of H^PtClg and acrylamide. The diameter of metallic Pt clusters embedded in the polymer film by this process was found to be 34.3 1.5 A. The mechanism of the catalyst preparation is discussed. The catalytic effectiveness of the polymer-embedded catalyst on visible light- induced hydrogen generation from water was investigated using the Ru- (bipy^/MV^/EDTA system. The hydrogen evolution rate was found to be slightly affected by varying Pt concentrations in the range 2 - 60 mg dm\"3. The rates of H^ formation were found to be optimal and equal within the pH range 5-6.4. This finding was interpreted in terms of the low specific activity of the polymer-Pt catalyst used to mediate MV2\"1\" hydrogenation. It is suggested that the finding that H; formation rates in the macroheterogeneous system are only slightly lower, as compared to colloidal solutions at equal Pt concentrations, can be partly ascribed to the adsorption of reactants onto the films in close proximity to the catalytic sites. The catalytic effectiveness of Pt was compared with that of Os, Pd and Ru embedded in nylon-acryl- amide copolymer films. Introduction The preparation of transition metal catalysts immobilized on solid supports continues to attract much attention [1 - 5]. There exists consider- able interest in combining the advantages of colloidally dispersed catalysts, which offer a large catalytic surface, with the ease of recovery which charac- terizes truly heterogeneous catalytic systems. We have tried to apply this 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 346 approach to the catalysis of the visible light-induced formation of hydrogen from water, a subject of intense current interest [6]. The Rutbipy)2\"1\"/^^2\"^/- EDTA/Pt system has been employed extensively in the last few years in the study of the mechanism of H; evolution from water [7 -16]. In this system the ruthenium tris-(bipyridyl) complex absorbs visible light, yielding the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited state *Ru(bipy)j\"1\" [17]. Methyl viologen (MV2\"1) acts as an electron transfer agent and ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a sacrificial electron donor. The '\"Ru^ipy)2\"1\" species transfers an electron to MV2\"1\", and subsequently the reduced methyl viologen cation radical (MV\"*\") reacts with protons at the catalyst site to produce Hz. The reaction cycle is completed by the reduction of Ru(bipy)|\"1\" to the 2\"'\" state by EDTA, as shown in the following scheme, where EDTAox represents the oxidized state of that molecule: hv EDTA R^bipy)^ > *Ru(bipy)l\\ MV^, EDTA Ru(bipy)r ^MV The catalytic step affects the overall efficiency of the process by competing with the undesired back reaction of the photoproducts. Thus, under favor- able catalytic conditions the H; production would be limited only by the cage escape yield in the primary photochemical event [11,18]. Microheterogeneously dispersed Pt particles, which can be considered to function as cathodically charged microelectrodes [11,12,19] in a manner similar to that proposed for silver [20] and gold [21, 22] hydrosols, are con- sidered as highly effective catalysts in H; evolution. Unfortunately, finely dispersed metals supported on soluble polymers cannot be easily recovered. Thus it was of interest to note that a recent study by Lehn and coworkers [23] indicates that Pt supported on several solid inorganic matrices exhibits a catalytic activity in the Ru(bipy)j+/MV2+/EDTA system comparable to or higher than when stabilized by soluble polymers. These authors report that Pt deposited on NaY zeolites, at a metal concentration of 2 - 3 X 10~4 mol dm\"3 and pH 4.8, yields a rate of H;; evolution comparable to that obtained in a microheterogeneous system. They also reported that the use of semi- conductor powders, such as TiO; and SrTi03, as Pt supports led to H; gener- ation rates greater by a factor of 3 - 4 than in the poly vinyl alcohol-supported system. A similar observation was reported by Gratzel and co-workers [24] who obtained a Pt concentration of 2 X 10~4 mol dm\"3 in colloidal solutions by depositing Pt on TiO; particles of grain size 1000 to 2000 A which were doped with 0.1% RuO;. They reported H2 evolution rates 4 times higher than in a microheterogeneous system formed by supporting the metal on Carbowax 20M. The high activity of Pt on semiconductor powders has been 347 rationalized in terms of the adsorption of the reactants on the surface of the inorganic matrix [24] and to electron injection into conduction bands of the support [6c, 23]. In this work we studied the use of synthetic membranes as recoverable Pt supports. It was expected that the immersion of a Pt-bearing membrane structure, possessing a relatively high water sorption capacity and a potential affinity for organic entities, in an aqueous solution containing Ru(bipy)j\"1\", MV2\"1\" and EDTA, would lead to the formation of domains of relatively high local concentrations of all the reactants in the photoreaction. The polymeric micro-environment could thus provide a suitable medium for the enhance- ment in restricted domains of the rate of Hz generation within the membrane structures. This could compensate for the reduction in the diffusional en- counters between the reduced methyl viologen radical formed in the bulk of the aqueous solution and the immobilized Pt particles, as compared with a system where the catalyst is microheterogeneously dispersed. In a previous study we have shown [25] that 7-irradiation of aqueous solutions of HzPtClfi and acrylamide (AM) or N-methylolacrylamide (NMAM) leads to the formation of a highly stable metallic Pt hydrosol. The high stability of the hydrosol was ascribed to strong coordination forces existing between the functional groups of the acrylamide and platinum. It could thus be expected that platinum particles deposited in a polyacrylamide (PAM) matrix would be strongly adsorbed. Since polyacrylamide has the disadvan- tage of being readily soluble in water, we employed as a solid support nylon-6 grafted acrylamide (Ny-g-AM) foils. It has recently been shown [26, 27] that membrane properties can be imparted to nylon film by ionizing radiation- induced grafting with hydrophilic monomers. AM was found to be a highly suitable monomer for that purpose [27]. Ny-g-AM membranes containing 90% by weight of the AM component can be easily prepared [28]. Such membranes, which can be considered as PAM crosslinked with nylon, are insoluble in aqueous solutions but exhibit high water uptake [28]. It should be mentioned that nylon beads have been used in the past quite extensively [3, 29] as supports for Pt in hydrogenation studies of unsaturated com- pounds. However the chief drawback of the nylon supports was found to be the poor accessibility of the catalyst embedded in the bulk of the polymer to the reactants. It has been claimed [29] that only those Pt particles that are located on the surface of the beads are catalytically active. This drawback of nylon should not apply to Ny-g-AM membranes due to the high water sorp- tion of the copolymer structure which allows the reactants to permeate the polymer and reach the catalytic sites. In this paper we report on the prepara- tion, characterization and performance of insoluble synthetic membranes bearing Pt particles in the photoinduced H; evolution reaction in the Ru- (bipy)2+/MV2+/EDTA system. TheH; generation activity in this macrohetero- geneous system is compared with that in which platinum is microhetero- geneously dispersed on a water-soluble polymer. The effects of the variation of solution pH and catalyst concentration on H; yield are considered and compared with those occurring in colloidal solutions. 348 Experimental Materials Nylon-6 biaxially oriented 13 Jum thick films were obtained from SNIA Viscose, acrylamide C.P. from Cyanamid, 2,2-bipyridine ruthenous di- chloride and methyl viologen from Pfaltz and Bauer, RuCIa, OsCl3, PdCl; and H^PtClg from Strem and NazEDTA from BDH. All chemicals were used as received. Catalyst preparation One g of 120 Jum thick dry nylon-grafted acrylamide (Ny-g-AM) co- polymer foil, prepared according to the technique described by us previously [27, 28] and containing approximately 90 wt.% AM, was placed in a glass ampoule to which was added 50 ml aqueous solution containing 0.1 wt.% Pt in the form of F^PtCle or other noble metal soluble salts, and 0.1 wt.% AM. The contents of the ampoule were left for 24 h and were stirred occasionally. Subsequently the solution was deaerated and irradiated with a ^Co source at a dose rate of 0.12 Mrad h~1 for 48 h. Following irradiation the plastic foil was rinsed vigorously with water and dried to a constant weight. The metal content of the foil was established by emission spectroscopy. The polymeric foils bearing the noble metals were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50 C. Subsequently the foils were cut into small 5X5 mm squares. Illumination Fifty ml of the solutions to be illuminated were introduced into a Pyrex flask equipped with three stoppered side-arms. The light beam was passed through a 400 nm cut-off filter and a 15 cm water cell to remove IR radiation. Solutions to be illuminated, unless otherwise stated, contained Ru^ipy^ (4X 10-5 moldm-^MV^X 10-3 moldm-3), EDTA (3 X 10-2 moldm~3) and varying amounts of square plastic foils containing the catalyst. The solutions were buffered in the pH range 4 - 5.9 with potassium hydrogen phthalate/HCl or NaOH mixtures. For runs at pH 6.4 - 7 the solutions were buffered with KHaP04/NaOH solutions. The solutions were stirred magnet- ically throughout the runs. Prior to illumination, the system was deoxygen- ated by flushing with purified nitrogen for 40 min. Continuous illuminations were carried out with the 150 W halogen lamp of a Rollei slide projector. The evolved gas was led into a volumetric burette maintained at constant temperature. Analytic procedure Hydrogen was determined using a thermal conductivity detector of a Hewlett Packard Model 5750 gas chromatograph, employing a column filled with molecular sieve 5A held at room temperature. The uptake of HzPtClg onto several different membranes was determined by following optical density changes at 2620 A. The platinum content of the plastic foils prior to and following the illumination was determined by emission spectroscopy em- ploying a Jarrel-Ash grating spectrograph. 349 The oxidation state of Pt supported on the plastic foils was established using ESCA technique to determine the binding energy of the 4f electrons. The measurements were carried out on Perkin-Elmer PHI model 555 ESCA- Auger spectrometer. The size of the platinum particles was determined by means of a Philips EMF 400T transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV and having a magnification of 60 K. The average diameter of the metal particles was evaluated by measuring the size distribution of 120 particles on an enlarged photograph (438 K). The accumulation of the reactants in the membrane matrix was deter- mined by immersing 1 g of the Ny-g-AM foils for 24 h under stirring in different solutions (50 ml), each containing one of the components of the reaction system in the concentration range used in the photolytic runs. The solutions were filtered to remove the plastic elements and analyzed on a Zeiss PMQ11 spectrophotometer. The uptake of Ru(bipy)j\"1\", MV2'1\" and EDTA was established by following by absorption spectroscopy the optical density changes in solutions at 2850, 2600 and 2300 A, respectively. Results and discussion Binding ofH^PtCl^ onto membrane films The data in Table 1 illustrate the extent of adsorption of HaPtCle from aqueous solutions onto several polymeric films bearing groups capable of complexing Pt(IV). Ny-g-AM appears to be the most effective adsorbing polymeric grid of these tested. Its adsorption capacity is much superior to that of Ny-g-NMAM under the conditions of the test. It is of interest to note that crosslinking the polyacrylamide chain with bisacrylamide reduced signif- icantly the extent of H^PtCl^ inclusion in the polymeric gel. In the course of a 24 h immersion of 1 g Ny-g-AM in 50 ml aqueous solution containing 0.1 wt.% each of AM and Pt (in the form of HaPtClg), 25% of the chloroplatinic acid became entrapped in the polymeric film. This represents 1.25% Pt included in the polymer. Following 7-irradiation for 48 h to reduce the H^PtClg, the Ny-g-AM films which acquired a deep brown color were analyzed by emission spectroscopy and a somewhat increased Pt content of 1.5% by weight was established. It is possible that the discrepancy between the two sets of data could be due to the fact that the adsorption of H2PtCle did not reach equilibrium during the 24 h contact preceding irradia- tion. In blank runs in which the polymeric films were immersed in solutions of identical compositions as used in 7-irradiation, no deepening of color associated with the formation of Pt clusters could be observed. The strong anchoring of Pt to the Ny-g-AM support was confirmed by flame spectroscopic analysis of Pt in the polymeric grids recovered from the photochemical reaction medium following 24 h illumination. The elution of Pt into the solution was minimal, the loss of Pt ranging from 1 to 3%. 350 TABLE 1 Adsorption of H^PtCl^ onto polymeric films Polymer % H^PtCle adsorbed Pt loading of the from solution1' polymeric film\" (wt.%) PVA'1 0.86 cellophane*1 0.46 Ny-g-AM'1 25 1.55 Ny-g-AM^is-AM)*1-6 13 Ny-g-NMAM*^ 15 \"One g of polymeric foils were placed for 24 h in 50 ml aqueous solution under occasional stirring.

The percentage of bisacrylamide incorporated in the AM network was estimated at 3.6%. The total graft yield (%) of AM in this sample was 1260. fThe nylon-grafted N-methylolacrylamide foil was prepared by a technique similar to that employed in the formation of Ny-g-AM [27, 28]. The total graft yield in the samples em- ployed was 640%. The mechanistic features of radiolytic reduction of H^PtCIf, and formation ofPt clusters embedded in Ny-g-AM In a previous study [25] we have shown that 7-irradiation of aqueous solutions containing 0.08 wt.% Pt in the form of HaPtCle and AM or N- methylolacrylamide in a monomer-to-chloroplatinic acid molar ratio ranging from 5 - 20 leads to the formation of a stable microheterogeneous dispersion of Pt. The high stability and the low polydispersity of the Pt colloid solutions were attributed by us to the Pt-monomer coordination occurring in the course of the 7-irradiation-induced reactions. In the present work, we were primarily interested in employing 7-radiation to generate species in the aqueous solution which would cause the reduction of HaPtCl^ embedded in the polymeric grid. It should be noted that in dilute aqueous solutions such as used in this study, ionizing radiation is absorbed predominantly by the solvent and that the primary radical species formed are aqueous electrons e^g, H and OH. The yields of these species in terms of G values (product species per 100 eV ab- sorbed) are 2.8, 0.65 and 2.8 respectively [25]. In order to convert the primary radiolytic species into reductants which could effectively permeate the polymeric grids and react with HyPtCl(, rather than with the polymeric matrix, which is made up predominantly of polymerized AM, we introduced into the solution AM at a concentration of 1.43 X 10~2 mol dm\"3. AM reacts very efficiently with ggq, H and OH species, the rate constants ranging be- 351 tween 2 X 109 and 2 X 1010 M-1 s~1 [30]. Thus at the dose rate of 1.2 X 105 rad h~1 and at a pH of ~2, due to the presence of 5.1 X 10~3 mol dm\"3 plat- inic acid, and that of free and polymerized AM higher by factors of 2.8 and 50 respectively from that of H^PtClg it is plausible to assume that the pre- dominant fraction of the primary radiolytic species will be converted into AM-derived radicals. It was hoped that such conditions would favor the reduction of the embedded H2PtC4 by organic reductants which would dif- fuse into the Ny-g-AM grid and reduce the H^PtCle in the grid. It can be calculated that if all the radiolytically-formed primary species would engage in the reduction of H2PtCle, either directly or via the intermediacy of the organic radicals formed in secondary reactions, a dose of about 3 Mrads would be required to ensure the reduction of 5.1 X 10~3 mol dm\"3 H^PtClg solutions. However, we have employed a dose of 5.7 Mrad since one cannot discount the possibility that even at the low monomer concentration used, some of the radicals formed might initiate homopolymerization of AM in the bulk of the solution or give rise to AM grafting onto the polymeric trunk. Analysis by electron spectroscopy (ESCA) of the polymeric fragments, which were subjected to vigorous rinsing with water prior to analysis, con- firmed that the HaPtClg embedded in Ny-g-AM was completely reduced. This is seen in the curve in Fig. 1 which shows the signals at 75.1 and 72.5 eV of the 4f5/2 and 4:f^^ electrons, consistent with zero-valentPt; the corresponding value for the 4f^/^ electron in Pt^in HzPtClg is 76 eV [31]. The reduction of HzPtClfi embedded in the gel structure implies that the reducing species formed in the bulk of the solution effectively diffused into the polymeric matrix during the radiolysis. This can be appreciated from the fact that at equilibrium, the water content of Ny-g-AM amounted to 6 molecules of H^O per AM monomer unit [28]. Thus the water component of the Ny-g-AM gel, in which 25 to 30% of the HzPtClg in the system is embedded, comprises less than 3% of the total volume of the solvent in the 'y-irradiated samples. 87 84 81 78 75 72 69 66 63 60 Binding energy (eV) Fig. 1. ESCA analysis of the oxidation state of Pt embedded in Ny-g-AM films. It is clear that the amount of radiolytically-formed reducing species within the gel could account for only a fraction of the reductants necessary to complete the reduction of HaPtClg. The effective migration of reducing 352 species from the solution to the polymeric grid calls attention to the role of AM in the solution. 7-Irradiation of Ny-g-AM immersed in aqueous solutions of only H2PtC4, followed by rinsing, resulted in a minimal (less than 0.1%) anchoring of Pt within the grid. Under these conditions it seems reasonable to assume that H2PtC4 adsorbed on the polymer was not effectively reduced and was eluted in the rinsing. The finding that, in the absence of free AM, H^PtClfi in the Ny-g-AM grids is not reduced can be partly ascribed to the fact that OH radicals are not effectively scavenged by the solid polymer and their presence would interfere in the reduction of chloroplatinic acid. As mentioned earlier, we tend to believe that the function of AM is not only to scavenge OH radicals but to react with all three primary radiolytic radicals, converting them into species which may diffuse readily into the Ny-g-AM matrix and permitting them to effect the reduction of the adsorbed H^PtClg. It should also be mentioned that the concentration of AM in the solu- tion is of importance. Increasing its concentration by a factor of three to 0.3 wt.% led to a decrease in the Pt content of the polymeric grid from 1.55 to 0.7%. This finding most likely reflects the fact that at higher AM concentra- tion the secondary AM radicals grow progressively in size, due to enhanced polymerization reactions which may adversely affect the transport of re- ductant species to the HzPtClg adsorbed into the Ny-g-AM grid. Until now we have not considered the fate of H2PtCl6 in the bulk of the solution. It is plausible to assume that part of the HaPtClg dissolved in the bulk of the solution will be reduced to metallic Pt. A fraction of metallic Pt particles may adhere to the surface of the Ny-g-AM matrix. However, we would expect that most of the Pt adsorbed in such fashion would be eluted during the rinsing process. The findings that practically no Pt was leached out of solution following the 24 h illumination and that the amount of metallic Pt embedded in the Ny-g-AM grid was almost equal to that adsorbed in the form of H^PtClg prior to radiolysis are consistent with the thesis that the main precursor of the Pt embedded in the polymeric grid is the H2PtCl6 which became embedded in the polymeric grids prior to 7-irradiation. We now turn to the size of Pt particles formed within the Ny-g-AM gel. In view of the relatively high local concentration of H^PtClg in the domain of the gel, one would expect that the metallic Pt clusters formed by radiolysis should be considerably larger than those formed in a colloidal solution, where a mean particle size of 17 A was found [25]. It was thus gratifying to find that the diameter of Pt particles, as measured by transmission electron microscopy, ranged from 23 - 48 A with a mean value of 34.3 1.5 A. This mean value is comparable with that obtained by means of the extensively used method of Turkevich etal. [32], which involves the reduction of chloro- platinic acid with sodium citrate and yields metallic clusters with an average diameter of 34 A. Heterogeneous catalysis of photo-induced H-^ generation from water In the following paragraphs the influence of several experimental parameters on the catalytic efficiency of Pt particles embedded in Ny-g-AM 353 gel films on H^ evolution from water employing the Ru(bipy)j+/MV2+/EDTA system is summarized. The catalytic performance of the Pt particles in this system is compared with that in the microheterogeneous system. Effect ofPt concentration The effect of the variation of Pt content by successive increases in the weight of Ny-g-AM film in the reaction vessel on H2 evolution rates is shown in Fig. 2a. The metal content of the samples was varied from 2 - 60 mg dm\"3, corresponding to a molar concentration range of 1 X ICT5 - 3 X 10~4 mol dm\"3. In Fig. 2b, H; evolution until plateau values is plotted for 2 and 14 mg dm\"3 Pt concentrations. The highest rate of generation is observed at a Pt content corresponding to a molar concentration of 7 X 10~5 mol dm\"3. The latter value is quite close to the optimum Pt concentration reported in several studies in which the effect of the concentration of microheterogeneously dispersed Pt on H; evolution rates was considered [11, 14]. In a previous work [25], employing radiolytically-reduced Pt supported on water-soluble JV-methylolacrylamide macromolecules (pNMAM), we found the highest H; yields at [Pt] = 4.1 X 10~5 mol dm\"3. Similarly, Amouyal et al. [11] and Maestri and Sandrini [14] reported optimal H2 evolution rates at a Pt con- centration range from 1.2 - 4 X 10~5 mol dm\"3. The data in Fig. 2a show an absence of significant variation in H; generation rates within the wide range of catalyst concentration studied. Of particular interest is the observation that a decrease in Pt concentration by a factor of 7 from its optimum value results in a lowering of H^ yields by about 25%. A similar pattern of catalytic behavior was observed in our previous study [25] employing a radiolytically- prepared microheterogeneous suspension of Pt. These findings are in contrast with those of other groups [11, 14,16, 33] employing colloidal Pt catalysts prepared by different methods. In all these studies a drastic decrease in Hz evolution rates was observed upon lowering the Pt concentration below its optimum value. Finally, it should be mentioned that the decrease in Hz evolution rates as a function of time (Figs. 2a and 2b) can be ascribed primarily to the depletion of EDTA which serves as a sacrificial agent in the system studied. Effect ofpH Figure 3 shows H; evolution rates in the pH range 4 - 7 employing the optimum Pt concentration of 14 mg dm\"3. The highest rate was observed in the pH range 5 - 6.4. In that range there was no significant variation in Ha rates within the experimental uncertainty. It should be mentioned that the rates of H; evolution at pH 5 - 6.4 shown in Fig. 3 are about 20% lower than those shown in Fig. 2a at identical Pt concentration. This discrepancy is due to the use of different illumination systems with a somewhat different geometry of the optical set-up. In our previous study [25] using radiolytically- prepared microdispersed Pt anchored to poly-AT-methylolacrylamide, we observed a decrease of about 15% in H; evolution rates on increasing the pH from 5 to 5.9.

Dependence of rate of H^ evolution upon pH, [Pt] = 14 mg dm\"3; 0 pH 5, pH 5.9, A pH 6.4, A pH 4, n pH 7. in pH values was reported by other workers [34, 35] employing micro- dispersed Pt stabilized by polymers. This pH effect on H; evolution rates was attributed by Keller and coworkers [35, 37] to the Pt-catalyzed hydrogena- tion of MV2\"1; a reaction which is enhanced at pH> 5 [8, 36, 37]. The constancy of Hz yields (in the present study) in the pH range 5 - 6.4 and the decrease by about 35 - 40% in H2 yields (after 7 h of illumination) on raising the pH to 7 (see Fig. 3) makes the catalytic behavior of the radiolytically- prepared heterogeneous Pt catalyst comparable to that of RuOa. RuO; has been shown recently [37] to act as a H; mediating catalyst in the Ru(bipy)2\"1\"/- MV^/EDTA system. Variation in pH from 5 - 6 resulted in only a small decrease of RuOz-catalyzed H; yields, while at pH 7 the H; output was reduced to 40% of that obtained at pH 5. Independent investigation of MV2\"1\" hydrogenation [37] has shown that RuO; is a poor catalyst for that reaction. This, finding was used by Keller et al. [37] to rationalize the pronounced difference of pH effect on the rates of H; evolution catalyzed by non-radiol- ytically-prepared Pt and RuO;. In light of this argument, it would appear that radiolytically-prepared Pt catalysts exhibit a tendency even lower than that of RuOa to mediate the undesired MV2\"*\" hydrogenation reaction. Turning now to the rate of H^ evolution at pH 4, we observed a photo- production rate lower by 15 to 20% than that at pH 5 to 6.4. A similar de- crease was reported by other groups [16, 38]. The reduction in H, yields at pH < 5 is attributed to the fact that the regeneration of Ru(bipy)2\"1\" by reaction with EDTA proceeds faster when the latter compound exists in its basic form [39]. Comparison of catalytic efficiency of microdispersed and immobilized Pt on H^ formation Figure 4 shows H; evolution rates over a prolonged period of time (until plateau values) in the Ru(bipy)2+/MV2+/EDTA system employing a catalyst concentration of 14 mg dm\"3, supported on soluble N-methylolacrylamide matrix or anchored to Ny-g-AM polymeric grids. Both runs were conducted 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Irradiation time (hours) Fig. 4. Comparison of rates ofH; evolution in heterogeneous and colloidal systems; [Pt] = 14 mg dm~3, pH = 5; (a) Pt supported on soluble Af-methylolacrylamide; (b) Pt embedded in Ny-g-AM. at pH 5 under identical illumination and reactant concentration conditions. The data in Fig. 4 indicate that the rate of H; formation mediated by micro- dispersed Pt appears to be higher on the average by about 20% than that in the heterogeneous system. However, the overall catalytic efficiency as mea- sured by turnover (T.O.) numbers [39] (ratio of moles H; produced to moles Pt) yields values of 392 and 371 for the microheterogeneous and macro- heterogeneous systems, respectively, indicating a difference of only about 6% in their activities. It should be noted that the findings of this and our previous study [25] indicate that H; yields are not significantly affected by reduction of the radiolytically-prepared catalyst concentration below the optimum value. Thus the T.O. numbers given above cannot be viewed as indicators of the catalytic efficiency of these catalysts. Considerably higher T.O. numbers can be calculated by employing lower catalyst concentrations. A T.O. number of 2000 is obtained from H2 yields in solutions containing a Pt concentration of 2 mg dm\"3 (see Fig. 2b). This value is comparable to the T.O. range of 1900 - 2900 reported by Keller et al. [38] employing similar concentrations of several microdispersed Pt systems. It is necessary to comment on the finding that H; evolution rates are only slightly lower in the macroheterogeneous system employing an inert matrix than in the microheterogeneous system in which the Pt is protected 357 by a soluble polymer whose chemical structure resembles that of the in- soluble polymeric grid. A priori one would expect that the diffusional encounter between the reduced electron relay agent MV\"*\" and the catalyst sites should be significantly more efficient in the colloidal system than in the macroheterogeneous one. In addition one has to bear in mind the larger size of Pt clusters in the Ny-g-AM support as compared with the microhetero- geneous system, and the possibility that the Pt within the insoluble grid may be somewhat less accessible to the reactants. All these factors could be expected to adversely affect the catalytic efficiency of the macrohetero- geneous system. However, the higher than expected efficiency in this system could be rationalized by assuming a non-homogeneous distribution of reactants. The adsorption of solutes in different parts of the polymeric gel could lead to the formation of domains of relatively high local reactant con- centrations in close proximity to Pt clusters. Such conditions could lead to enhanced hydrogen generation within the gel structure. In order to evaluate the extent of reactant accumulation within the polymeric grids, Ny-g-AM foils were introduced into solutions containing one of the reactants at a con- centration used in the photochemical runs and left under stirring for 24 h. After removal of the polymeric elements, the change in solute concentration was determined by optical absorbance measurements. The data thus obtained are summarized in Table 2 and suggest that the concentration of reactants within the polymeric gel is higher by a factor of 5 - 10 than in the bulk of the solution. In spite of the fact that the absorption data were obtained using Ny-g-AM without Pt and the possibility that the absorption of reactants from a ternary solution may be somewhat different than from a single solute solution, the results in Table 2 do indeed seem to support the assumption that, within the polymeric grids, domains of enhanced reactant concentra- tions may be formed in close proximity to the catalytic sites.

The catalytic efficiency of recovered Ny-g-AM/Pt grids In order to evaluate the suitability of the Ny-g-AM/Pt grids for repeated catalytic use, we have chosen to study the time profile of H2 evolution at the optimal catalyst concentration used in this study, namely at 14 mg Pt dm\"3 (see curve a in Fig. 2a). Following 40 h illumination of the reaction system, the solid particles were filtered off the solution. After rinsing, the recovered grids were immersed for 24 h in an aqueous solution and vacuum dried. The dry Ny-g-AM grids were transferred into a fresh reaction solution having reactant composition identical to that used in the first run, and subjected to 40 h illumination. The rate of H^ evolution was found to be about 90% that observed in the first run. The decrease in H; evolution in the second experi- ment can partly be ascribed to a small loss of the polymeric particles during the handling. This procedure was repeated for a third time, and again the rate of H^ generation was found to be within 90 to 95% of that in the pre- ceding run. It would thus appear that the Ny-g-AM/Pt catalyst system has a potential for repeated use. Comparison of catalytic effectiveness of noble metals on H^ evolution rates Osmium, palladium and ruthenium were embedded in Ny-g-AM films following the procedure employed for Pt deposition. Their catalytic effec- tiveness at the same weight content (20 mg dm\"3) on H^ generation rates is shown in Fig. 5. The reactivity trend, Pt-Pd-Os-Ru, is similar to that ob- served in the microheterogeneous system [25]. We cannot presently offer an explanation for the finding that Hz evolution rates catalyzed by Pd attain plateau values after 5 h illumination. 45678 Irradiation time (hours) Fig. 5.

Noble metals concentration 20 mg dm\"3. 359 Conclusions 7-Irradiation of nylon-acrylamide copolymer films submerged in an aqueous solution of noble metals salts and a suitable monomer provides a convenient method for the formation of finely dispersed metallic catalysts deposited in a polymeric gel grid. The recoverable Pt catalyst formed in this fashion exhibits a catalytic activity comparable to that observed in a micro- heterogeneous system. It is suggested that the relatively high efficacy of the heterogeneous Pt catalyst is partly due to the ability of the polymeric supports to absorb reactants from the bulk of the solution. The radiolytically- prepared Pt catalysts embedded in the nylon-grafted polyacrylamide grids show little tendency to mediate the undesired pH-dependent hydrogenation of the MV2\"1\" electron relay agent.
