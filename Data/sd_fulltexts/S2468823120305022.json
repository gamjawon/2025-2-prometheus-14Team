Graphical abstract The hydroesterification of styrene with CO and alcohol was catalyzed by porous organic polymer-supported palladium catalyst under mild conditions. Hydroesterification of olefins with alcohols and CO is an attractive approach to synthesize value-added carboxylic esters. The current manufactures are mainly based on the use of homogeneous catalytic systems, and developing a heterogeneous process enabling cost-effective catalyst separation is of potential interest, particularly for higher olefins. In this contribution, we reported a robust porous organic polymer-supported palladium catalyst that exhibited excellent hydroesterification performance approaching that of the homogeneous counterpart. In addition, the catalyst shows remarkable adaptability for a broad range of substrates (both olefins and alcohols) and recyclability. The catalysts are thoroughly characterized by a spectrum of characterization techniques including N2 sorption, SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM coupled with elemental mapping, FTIR with CO probe, XPS, and solid-state 31P NMR. Based on these, the good catalytic performance can be attributed to the high surface area, highly dispersed active metal species, and the strong coordination bonds between palladium center and the exposed phosphorous ligands in Porous organic polymer (POPs) frame. The ICP-OES and hot filtration test further indicate that the reaction truly proceeds in a heterogeneous manner, thus exhibiting great potential for industrial applications. Keywords Hydroesterification Palladium Porous organic polymers Olefins Carboxylic easter 1 Introduction Carboxylic esters and their derivatives are a class of valuable compounds in the chemical sector and can serve as versatile intermediates in the production of drugs (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen), surfactants, and perfumes [1–7]. Transition metals catalyzed hydroesterification of olefins is one of the most effective methods to synthesize these high-value products owing to the perfect atom economy and wide availability of raw materials (alkenes, alcohols, and CO) [8–13]. To date, transition metals including Rh [14,15], Ru [16,17], Ni [18,19], Co [20], and Pd [21–24] have been studied in the hydroesterification of olefins. Among all the reported catalytic systems, the palladium-based homogeneous system comprising of Pd, phosphorous ligand, and acids has received considerable attentions due to their good substrate adaptability and excellent catalytic performance. For example, PdCl2/PPh3/CuCl2 [25], [Pd(dtbpx)(dba)] [26], [Pd(PPh3)2(alkene)] [27], and [PdCl2(dppp)] [28] and other catalytic system. The above homogeneous organometallic catalysts play a key role in the field of modern catalysis due to their high activity and selectivity. However, the homogeneous nature plagues the catalyst recycling process and restricts their extensive exploitation, especially for higher olefins where catalyst and product separation is more challenging. To overcome these problems, one of the most popular methods is immobilization of metal complex onto insoluble supports. Alper’s group [29,30] prepared the montmorillonite-supported palladium catalysts, which gave of the conversion and selectivity of 100 % and 88 %, respectively. Unfortunately, the reusability of catalyst was not investigated. Later, they further developed a palladium-complex immobilized on silica [31], achieving 99 % conversion with adding additional PPh3. Unfortunately, a decreased activity was observed for the recycled catalyst. Hou and Tanaka [32] reported the acidic resin-supported palladium complexed catalysts that could be recycled five times with a consistent yield. In general, the conventional solid catalysts show a relatively low activity or poor reusability because of the poor chemical modification and low surface areas. Therefore, there is still a strong desire to develop a heterogeneous catalyst combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for alkene hydroesterification. Porous organic polymers (POPs) [33–36] are emerging as a versatile platform for the development of heterogeneous active metal highly dispersed or single-atom catalysts [37–42], due to its large surface area, hierarchical porosity, high stability, and flexibility in building block design. Owing to the rich and strong anchoring sites of the ligands, different transition metals can be introduced into the solid polymers through the formation of stable metal-ligand complexes via some coordination bonds. Such heterogenized metal catalysts cannot ease the leaching of active metal species and thus facilitate catalyst and product separation. In our previous work [43], PPh3@POP was developed by hydrothermal polymerization of tris-vinyl-functionalized PPh3 ligand in the presence of copolymerized monomers (Scheme 1 ). And the PPh3@POP polymer supported Au [44], Rh [37,45], Ru [46], Zn [47], Pd [48,49] metal catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance in hydroamination, hydroformylation, hydrogenation, and coupling reactions. It is worth mentioning that the PPh3@POP supported palladium catalyst not only gave a high yield of 99 % of 4-acetyl-biphenyl but also can be reused 10 times without any activity drop in the coupling reactions of aryl chlorides. As an extension of our previous work, the hybrid catalyst further evaluated in the hydroesterification of olefins. To our delight, the catalyst was found to be highly efficient, giving activity and selectivity approaching those of their corresponding homogeneous counterpart under the same conditions and it can be reused 5 times without loss of activity. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All reagents were of analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from sodium and PCl3 was distilled under argon prior to use. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts All operations were carried out under anaerobic anhydrous conditions. PPh3@POP and divinylbenzene (DVB) was prepared according to our previous report [43]. The procedure for the synthesis of Pd/PPh3@POP was as follows. 1.0 g PPh3@POP was added to 20 mL THF solution containing 14.7 mg palladium acetate and stirred at room temperature for 24 h under N2. The solid sample was centrifugally separated, washed with excessive THF, and dried at 65 °C under vacuum. The obtained sample was denoted as xPd/PPh3@POP, where x represents the Pd content in wt.%. The Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2 and Pd/DVB catalysts were also prepared according to the above operation. 2.3 Characterization of catalysts The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore distribution of the samples were measured by adsorption-desorption of N2 at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The samples were outgassed at 120 °C for 24 h before measurements. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an X'per PRO X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical using Cu Kα radiation in a scanning range of 10°–90° at a speed of 10° min−1. The tube pressure was 40 kV and tube flow was 40 mA. The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) experiments of the catalysts were carried out on a STA 499 F3 thermogravimetric analyzer. SEM study was measured using a FEI Quanta 200 F scanning electron microscope. TEM measurement was performed on a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurement was carried out on a JEOL-ARM200 F electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a 15 kV Al Kα X-ray source as the radiation source. The 31P solid-state NMR experiments were carried out on VARIAN's Infinitypius NMR spectrometer. The in situ FTIR measurement with CO was carried out using Bruker's Tensor 27 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. All spectra were recorded with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Before the test, the sample was evacuated at 150 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to 30 °C and purged with helium for 30 min to collect background spectrum A. After exposure to 2 % CO for 20 min, the He purged for 30 min and recorded a spectrum B. The difference between the spectrum B and the background spectrum A is the infrared spectrum of the sample adsorbed CO. 2.4 Hydroesterification of olefins Hydroesterification of olefins was carried out in an autoclave. Typically, 50 mg catalyst, 2 ml methanol, 1 mmol styrene and 25 mg p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) were sequentially added to the autoclave. The reactor was then sealed and purged three times with pure CO, followed by adjusting the pressure to 2.0 MPa. The temperature was raised to 90 °C in a water bath for 5 h. Afterward, the reactor was cooled to room temperature with ice-water, the liquid samples were centrifuged to isolate the catalyst, and then the solution was analyzed off-line by Agilent 7890B gas chromatography with a HP-5 capillary column and an FID detector. The selectivity of the product is calculated by the sum of the linear and branched ester. Hydroesterification of other olefins were tested according to the same procedure described above for styrene. The hot filtration reaction was performed in the presence of the Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst for 1 h, and then the solid catalyst was filtered off at the reaction temperature. The resulting filtrate was placed under the same reaction conditions as the original reaction and analyzed by GC. The TOF value was calculated according to: TOF = mole of esters mole of Pd ( OAc ) 2 × reaction time 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The Pd/PPh3@POP catalysts were thoroughly characterized by various characterization techniques. The metal content was measured by ICP-OES, showing that the Pd loadings in the catalysts are nearly equal to the preset values (Table 1 ). This indicates that most of the Pd species were anchored on the PPh3@POP support during the synthesis. The structures of Pd/PPh3@POP series were analyzed by N2 sorption (Fig. 1 a). The pore size distribution curves are shown in Fig. 1b, which confirms the hierarchical structures of these samples that might facilitate the mass transfer of reactants during catalysis. The BET surface areas, mean pore diameters, and pore volumes are also listed in Table 1. Obviously, the surface area and pore volume of the Pd/PPh3@POP ensembles slightly decreased after immobilization of the metal. This might be because a minimal content of channels was occupied by the Pd species. Nonetheless, the immobilized Pd species did not affect the pore size distributions (Fig. 1b). The SEM image of 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP are displayed in Fig. 1d, which indicates that the catalyst still has rough surfaces and a considerable number of pores. This is consistent with the results of the N2 sorption analysis. The thermal stability of the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst was examined by TG analysis (Fig. S1). A minute weight loss of 7.3 % at about 200 °C owing to the removal of physically absorbed solvent. The TG curve showed that the biggest weight loss started at 450 °C due to the decomposition of the catalyst structure. Based on these observations we can conclude that the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst exhibited excellent thermal stability, which is comparable to the PPh3@POP support [48]. The phase composition of PPh3@POP and Pd/PPh3@POP catalysts was then studied by XRD (Fig. 1c). No obvious diffraction peaks of Pd species was observed in all the catalysts except one broad peak at 15° 2θ related to amorphous carbon. It suggests that the Pd species are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the support. To further investigate the existing state of the Pd species, TEM coupled with EDS was applied (Fig. 1e). No Pd nanoparticles catalyst can be visualized in the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP but the presence of the metal was indeed confirmed by EDS. Therefore, the sample was further investigated by means of HAADF-STEM. The HAADF-STEM image clearly showed the isolated Pd species (indicated by the circles) uniformly dispersed on the support (Fig. 1f). This might be because of the abundant mesopores of the support allowing the Pd species pass through the pore wall and be uniformly dispersed on the inner surface, as well as the strong coordination bonds between Pd and the phosphorous ligands. To observe the element distribution in the catalyst intuitively, the catalyst was studied via STEM-mapping (Fig. 1g). The HAADF-STEM elemental color mapping results show homogeneous distribution of Pd and P, further supporting the high dispersion of palladium and good contact between the Pd species and the phosphorous ligands. To examine the strong coordination bonds between Pd and the ligand, solid-state 31P NMR were carried out on the PPh3@POP and the heterogenized 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst (Fig. S2). Except for the peak at −7.1 ppm belonged to uncoordinated P atoms, a small new peak at 27 ppm was detected for the polymer support. Obviously, the intensity of this peak increased after immobilization of the Pd species. According to our previous work, the peak at 27 ppm can be attributed to both the P atoms coordinated with palladium (P-Pd) and the oxidized phosphorus (PO) [48,50]. It suggests that there were truly strong coordination bonds between Pd and P, which would play a significant role in the stabilization of single-atom palladium. Thus, the PPh3@POP polymer can not only functions as a carrier but also as a solid ligand via the formation of chemical bonds. To determine the chemical environment of palladium, the Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst was characterized by XPS. Clearly, Fig. 2 a shows the characteristic signals of Pd, P, C and O. According to previous works [32,51,52], the peak at 338.0 eV for the fresh catalyst can be ascribed to Pd2+ species, while the peak at 336.2 eV can be ascribed to Pd0 species (Fig. 2b). It indicated that both of Pd0 and Pd2+ species were present on the surface of 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst. The Pd0 species can be formed by the interaction between Pd and PPh3 since that PPh3 can reduce the Pd2+ species by an intramolecular reaction [53]. As shown in Fig. S3, a slight increase of binding energy in P 2p core level XPS spectra for Pd/PPh3@POP in comparison with PPh3@POP was observed. According to previous studies [48,54], this is possibly due to electron transfer from P to Pd. It further suggests that there were truly strong coordination bonds between Pd and P, which is consistent with the results of solid 31 P NMR. The CO stretching frequency strongly depends on the binding mode as well as the type of Pd site where the CO is adsorbed. The distribution of Pd on the catalyst surface was also detected by CO-FTIR (Fig. 2c). The weaker peaks in 1928 cm−1 and 1886 cm-1 are assigned to bridge-bonded CO and 3-fold hollow CO on palladium respectively [54,55]. And the peak intensity increased with the increase of palladium loading. This may be due to the presence of a small amount of palladium clusters in the catalyst with higher palladium content. It is worth mentioned that the traditional material supported Pd catalyst (0.7Pd/Al2O3) has a weak CO adsorption peak at 2050 cm-1, which is attributed to Pd(CO)n [56]. Generally, the phosphine ligand acts as electron-donating ligand, thereby favoring the back-donation of electrons to the 2π* antibonding orbitals of CO, which weakens C O bonding to induce a red shift of the CO stretching [54,57,58].Therefore, the peak at 2029 cm-1 may be the red shift from 2050 cm-1 of CO stretching caused by the electron donation of the phosphine ligand. Furthermore, with the increase of the P/Pd ratio, the slight shift of the peak to low wavenumber was observed, which also confirmed that the increase of phosphine ligands caused the change of the peak position. 3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of different catalysts was evaluated in the hydroesterification of styrene (Table 2 ). No corresponding esters were formed when only PPh3@POP support was employed (Table 2, entry 1), which proves that the hydroesterification cannot proceed without Pd species. The conversion of styrene improved obviously with the Pd loading increased, and achieved the optimal conversion of 64.7 % when the loading was 0.7 %. The reaction rates dropped to 46.9 % when the Pd loading was further increased to 1.0 %. This might be attributed to the fact that PPh3@POP was used not only as support but also as P ligand that affects the reaction process. To glean further information about the influence of PPh3@POP support, the conventional carrier-supported Pd catalysts (0.7Pd/Al2O3, 0.7Pd/DVB and 0.7Pd/SiO2) were also explored for the hydroesterification of styrene (Table 2, entries 10–12). Obviously, no esters product was obtained over these three catalysts without the addition of P ligand. The results suggested that Pd-P species on the surface of PPh3@POP support were the active centers, and the PPh3@POP support had a special characteristic of bi-functionalization compared with the conventional supports. Furthermore, the activity of the heterogenized 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst compared with the typical homogeneous 0.7Pd-PPh3 complex was investigated under the same reaction conditions. To our delight, the heterogeneous system exhibited excellent catalytic activity 100 % conversion and 96.6 % selectivity, quite comparable to the Pd-PPh3 homogeneous counterpart after 5 h of reaction. When the reaction time was shortened to 3.5 h, the heterogeneous 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst also exhibited comparable catalytic activity. Subsequently, the effects of reaction time, temperature, CO initial partial pressure and H+/Pd molar ratio on the performance of 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP in hydroesterification of styrene was investigated (Fig. 3 ). The conversion of styrene enhanced drastically from 25.1% to 99.2% within 9 h (Fig. 3a). However, the reaction rates slowed down with the extension of reaction time. This might be due to that the concentration of styrene decreased with reaction time. At the meantime, the selectivity of the target product remained above 94.0 %. Fig. 3b showed the influence of temperature on the catalytic performance. The conversion of styrene increased from 12.5% to 99.8% when the temperature was raised from 50 to 100 °C, and maintained an excellent selectivity (>95.0 %). However, further increased the temperature to 130 °C led a decreased selectivity of 82.0 %. These results proved that the formation of by-products was favored at high temperatures. Fig. 3c displayed the effect of initial partial pressure of CO on the catalytic activity. The catalytic reactivity increased rapidly with the increasing of CO partial pressure, but when the CO partial pressure was further raised, the conversion decreased. The conversion reached a maximum of 99.7 % at 2.0 MPa. The p-toluenesulfonic acid concentration (H+/Pd) also had a significant influence on the catalytic activity (Fig. 3d). The reaction rate increased rapidly with increasing the H+/Pd ratio. The highest conversion of 98.3 % and selectivity of 98.0 % was obtained when the H+/Pd ratio was enhanced to 70. Nonetheless, a minimal decrease of selectivity was observed when the H+/Pd ratio was further increased to 110. This might be result from the decomposition of target esters when a greater number of acid sites were present. The stability of the supported complex during the hydroesterification reaction is of great concern for most anchored catalysts. The reusability of the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst for the hydroesterification of styrene was investigated (Fig. 4 a). After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was readily separated by centrifugation and then reused for the next run. Exposure of the catalyst to air was avoided as the whole process was conducted in a glovebox. After five cycles, the reused 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance of a conversion of 85.0 % and a selectivity of 95.3 %, which were comparable to the performance of the fresh catalyst. SEM images revealed that the porous structure of the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst after five cycles was not changed (Fig. S4). However, the surface area and pore volume of the spent catalyst decreased from 905 to 689 m2 g-1 and 1.55 to 1.45 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). This might be attributed to the adsorption of bulk p-TsOH on the catalyst surface. Additionally, metal leaching of the heterogeneous 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst was investigated by means of ICP-OES (Table 1). It was found that the Pd content on the spent catalyst after five runs was 0.56 % which was relatively lower than that of the fresh catalyst of 0.64 %. To investigate the Pd leaching problem, the content of metal in the reaction solution was also detected by ICP-OES. It is found that the amount of Pd that leached in the reaction solution is too low to be detected, confirming that leaching is negligible. Therefore, the decrease in Pd content may be due to some content of solid TsOH was mixed with the used catalyst during the ICP measurement. To probe the heterogeneous nature of the catalytic process, a hot filtration test was conducted (Fig. 4b) [32,59,60]. The results revealed that no additional esters were generated after the solid catalyst was filtered off, which confirms that the reaction occurred on a truly heterogeneous manner. The catalysts after catalytic tests were then characterized by combined techniques. XRD pattern revealed that no characteristic peaks of palladium particles were observed for the 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst after five cycles (Fig. 1c). It indicated that the Pd species were highly dispersed on the surface of PPh3@POP support even after the reaction process, or may be due to the Pd loading is lower than the detection limit of XRD. TEM analysis of the recovered catalyst after the first cycle showed that no palladium particles were formed on 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst (Fig. S5). However, the HAADF-STEM images of the catalyst after 5 runs visualized the presence of small Pd nanoparticles (∼3−5 nm) dispersed within the porous structures of the PPh3@POP in addition to the single Pd atoms (Fig. 4c, d). The aggregation might be explained by that the Pd2+ species were reduced to Pd0 by CO during the reaction process. This conclusion was further supported by XPS and FTIR with CO. The Pd 3d XPS spectrum of the catalyst after 5 reuses shifted to low binding energies in comparison to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 2b). On the basis of deconvolution, the percentage share of Pd0 increased from 56.4 % to 63.1 % after catalytic uses. In situ FTIR with CO on 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst further confirms the XPS results (Fig. S6). When increasing the CO blowing time or the temperature, the intensity of 3-fold hollow CO adsorbed in extended palladium (1886 cm−1) was enhanced, meanwhile the peak intensity of CO adsorbed in single-atom palladium (1928 cm−1) was gradually weakened. The postulated reaction mechanism over the Pd/PPh3@POP catalyst was proposed in Scheme 2 , according to the previously reports in the literature [31,61,62]. The active species palladium hydride a’ is generated with the participation of acid and CO, and subsequently attacked by olefin. Then, the CO migrated to the palladium-carbon bond to form Pd–acyl complex e and e’. These complexes are finally attacked by alcohol nucleophiles to obtain the corresponding ester products, and the palladium hydride active species are regenerated at the same time. The best-performing catalyst developed in this study, 0.7Pd/PPh3@POP, was then extrapolated to the hydroesterification of several other alkenes and alcohols to the corresponding esters (Fig. 5 ). Good to excellent selectivity were achieved for the C1-C5 alcohols. Obviously, the catalytic activity decreased with the increasing of the carbon atoms of the alcohol molecule (Fig. 5b). In addition, the configuration of alcohol molecules had a great impact on the catalyst activity as exemplified by the several cases of linear/branched alcohols. This might be due to the fact that the structure of alcohols molecular affected the nucleophilic attack in the reaction process, which is proposed to be the product forming step in hydroesterification of olefins. Fig. 5c shows the substrate effect of different alkenes. With the substituent inductive effect gradually reduced by F, Cl, or Br on the benzene ring, the conversion of the hydroesterification decreased from 99.5 % to 66.4 %. When the substituents are tert-butyl and methoxy with an electron-donating effect, the conversion are 61.1 % and 63.2 %, respectively. This proved that the aromatic alkenes with either electron-donating (OMe, tBu) or electron-withdrawing (F, Cl, Br) substituents on the phenyl ring provided the corresponding products in good conversion and excellent selectivities. When the linear olefins were used in the hydroesterification reaction, an excellent conversion of 99.3 % was obtained. This indicates that the catalyst we developed has excellent substrate universality. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction was significantly reduced possibly due to the influence of the CC bond conversion of the linear olefin according to previous report [3]. 4 Conclusions Porous organic polymer-supported single-atom palladium was designed and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of valuable carboxylic esters through the hydroesterification of alkenes with alcohols and CO. The catalyst showed remarkable catalytic performance for a broad scope of different alcohols and alkenes. In addition, the catalyst could be easily separated through simple centrifugation and exhibited excellent reusability after consecutive runs, which is a major advance compared to the previous works. Aggregation of palladium species occurred during multiple catalytic cycles, possibly by the reduction of CO molecules, but the impact on the catalytic performance was not significant. A possible reaction mechanism was also proposed for the heterogeneous catalytic system.

        "dc:description": "Hydroesterification of olefins with alcohols and CO is an attractive approach to synthesize value-added carboxylic esters. The current manufactures are mainly based on the use of homogeneous catalytic systems, and developing a heterogeneous process enabling cost-effective catalyst separation is of potential interest, particularly for higher olefins. In this contribution, we reported a robust porous organic polymer-supported palladium catalyst that exhibited excellent hydroesterification performance approaching that of the homogeneous counterpart. In addition, the catalyst shows remarkable adaptability for a broad range of substrates (both olefins and alcohols) and recyclability. The catalysts are thoroughly characterized by a spectrum of characterization techniques including N2 sorption, SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM coupled with elemental mapping, FTIR with CO probe, XPS, and solid-state 31P NMR. Based on these, the good catalytic performance can be attributed to the high surface area, highly dispersed active metal species, and the strong coordination bonds between palladium center and the exposed phosphorous ligands in Porous organic polymer (POPs) frame. The ICP-OES and hot filtration test further indicate that the reaction truly proceeds in a heterogeneous manner, thus exhibiting great potential for industrial applications.",
