Hoang, H. Berndt, H. Miessner, E. Schreier, J. V lter, H. Lieske* Institute of Applied Chemistry Berlin-Adlershof, Rudower Chausse 5, D-12484 Berlin, Germany Received 29 March 1994 Abstract Nickel containing H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by impregnation with nickel nitrate at pH 1.8 and 4.8. The catalysts were characterized by infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and ammonia, by temperature-programmed reduction as well as by chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen. The conversion of n-hexane served as a catalytic test reaction. Impregnation at pH 1.8 leads to nickel ions exchange of Br nsted sites in the channel system. These are hardly reducible and are not detectable by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Aromatization is increased. This is explained by the presence of ionic nickel Lewis sites, active in dehydrogenation. With impregnation at pH 4.8, tetrameric nickel ions exist, not able to penetrate into the channels, and nickel is mainly located outside the channels as metallic nickel. The selectivity to aromatics is still higher. This should be due to the action of metallic nickel, which promotes the direct dehydrocyclization. The hydrogenolysis activity of metallic nickel is suppressed.

Introduction It is well known that H-ZSM-5 zeolite can be modified by incorporation of metals or metal oxides in order to obtain catalysts for selective hydrocarbon conversions. For example, the modification of H-ZSM-5 with platinum, gallium oxide or zinc oxide results in selective catalysts for the aromatization of light alkanes [ 1-4] . The catalyst systems prepared in this way operate bifunctionally. The primary role of the transition metal, or of gallium and zinc species, was suggested to consist in increasing the rate of alkane dehydrogenation to alkenes as the rate determining *Corresponding author.

Among the Group VIII metals, platinum and palladium supported on H-ZSM-5 have been widely and thoroughly investigated [1-4,9], whereas nickel was only rarely studied. Nickel on H-ZSM-5 has been found to be active in the aromatization of higher n-alkanes [ 10 ] , in hydrocracking of n-dodecane [ 11 ] and in the isomerization of C$ aromatics [ 12,13]. Nickel exchanged H-ZSM-5 catalysts were reported to be active in the hydrogenolysis, but not selective in the aromatization of propane [ 14] . A hybrid catalyst composed of H-ZSM-5 and Ni/Si02 has been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity for n-butane aromatization [ 7 ] . On the whole, there is a gap concerning the characterization of nickel in Ni/H-ZSM5. The state of nickel, which is strongly dependent on the catalyst preparation and pretreatment modes [ 15-18], was not sufficiently investigated up to now and the conclusions about the catalytic role of nickel remained uncertain. We were especially interested in the investigation of Ni/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, because it is well documented in the literature that the state of nickel on some supports, such as alumina or HY zeolite, can be strongly modified, causing surprising changes of the catalytic properties. For example, the well-known hydrogenolysis activity of nickel could be suppressed, whereas its dehydrogenating property increased and became predominant in some cases [ 19-21 ] . The aim of this work was to study the interaction of nickel species with H-ZSM5. We were interested in the following questions: how, on the one hand, is the state of nickel influenced by the presence of H-ZSM-5 as a support and how, on the other hand, can the nickel species influence the properties of H-ZSM-5, especially its acidity. Finally, we wanted to study the effect of the cooperation of nickel and HZSM-5 on the catalytic properties. The conversion of n-hexane was chosen as a test reaction. In order to compare the results with a well-known metal promoted system, we investigated a sample of Pt/H-ZSM-5. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), oxygen and hydrogen pulse chemisorption as well as infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO-IR) were used in order to characterize the state of nickel and platinum. The acidic properties of H-ZSM-5 were investigated by infrared spectroscopy and by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia ( TPDA) . 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation H-ZSM-5 was prepared by calcination (2 h at 300 C and 2 h at 500 C) of the NH4+- form of a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al=19), produced by Bitterfeld Chemie AG (Germany). The dry H-ZSM-5 was impregnated with a 0.05 M solution of nickel nitrate at pH 4.8 or at pH 1.8 using vacuum rotary evaporation.

Pt/H-ZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating HZSM-5 with a HZPtCl6 solution and treated in the same way. The samples were stored in dry air. The catalysts prepared are listed in Table 1 and noted A to E. 2.2. Infrared spectroscopy OH vibration spectra and spectra of adsorbed ammonia These spectra were recorded with a spectrometer Specord M85 (Carl Zeiss Jena), using a heatable cell and self-supporting wafers of ca. 7 mg/cmz. The samples were heated under vacuum at 400 C for 18 h in order to remove adsorbed water. 20 Torr (1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) ammonia were adsorbed at room temperature for 30 min and subsequently desorbed at 100 C in order to remove physisorbed ammonia. The IR spectra were recorded in the ranges 3800-3200 cm-t and 1800-1300 cm-' at room temperature. Spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide Transmission spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide were obtained using a conventional glass cell with KBr windows, connected to a vacuum line and gas dosing system for in-situ pretreatment. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers with ca. 10 mg/cm2. The pretreatment consisted in an evacuation (10-4 Torr) of the calcined sample at room temperature (1 h) and at 300 C (1 h) as well as in a subsequent reduction in hydrogen (ca. 50 Torr, 500 C, 1 h) followed by evacuation at 500 C for at least 30 min. After exposing the pretreated samples to 5-10 Torr CO at room temperature, spectra were recorded by means of a FT-IR spectrometer (BIORAD; FTS60A) at a resolution of 2 cm- t. In order to obtain a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio, 256 scans were accumulated. The spectra shown in this paper are corrected for the background and the contribution of the windows. 2.3. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia In order to obtain information about the Br nsted acidity of the initial zeolite HZSM-5, quantitative TPDA measurements of this material were carried out.

The result was taken as a basis value for estimating the Br nsted acidity of the modified samples, vide infra. 2.4. Temperature-programmed reduction and hydrogenloxygen pulse chemisorption TPR and chemisorption measurements were performed with a dynamic AMI-1 characterization system (Altamira Instr., Inc.). The catalyst samples (500 mg) were heated up to 550 C in a helium flow containing 5% oxygen in order to remove water and organic contaminations. TPR was carried out in a argon flow containing 5.34% hydrogen at a gas flowrate of 70 ml/min and a heating rate of 20 K/min. The TPR was stopped at 500 C for samples used for pulse chemisorption, but extended to 1000 C otherwise, in order to get information on the reduction behaviour of nickel ions at higher temperatures. The TPR was always finished by an isothermal 1 h period at the final temperature. With nickel containing samples, the reduction degree was corrected for argon desorption at low temperatures and for the hydrogen consumption of the zeolite. The pulse chemisorption of hydrogen or oxygen was carried out at 0 C using a helium or argon flow of 50 ml/min and 55 /A pulses of pure hydrogen or of 20% oxygen in helium, respectively. For calculating the metal dispersion, adsorption stoichiometries of Ni/O=1 and Pt/H=1 were assumed. 2.5. n-Hexane conversion The conversion of n-hexane was carried out under normal pressure at 500 C in a fixed-bed glass reactor, continuously fed either with a hydrogen or a nitrogen flow, in each case saturated with n-hexane at 15 C (P,,-hexane= 98 Torr). The catalyst samples were pretreated in air at 300 C for 1 h in situ, followed by a hydrogen treatment at 500 C for 1 h. The reaction products, mainly consisting of lower alkanes C,-C4, alkenes CZ-C4 and aromatics C6-Cg, were analyzed using gas chromatography. The dependence of the n-hexane conversion on the contact time W/F was investigated. An influence of slow diffusion was excluded. In this paper, the catalytic properties of the catalysts are compared at a contact time W/F=4.7 gcata,yst h/mol _hexane. The conversions were in the 12-20% range in nitrogen atmosphere, and in the 15-60% range in hydrogen atmosphere. The deactivation of the catalysts during the 5 h experiments was negligible. D.L.

TPR, chemisorption and CO-IR: state of nickel and platinum TPR and chemisorption Fig. 1 shows the TPR profiles of the samples noted A to E. The peak at room temperature is not due to hydrogen consumption but to the argon desorption from the zeolite channels. The peak above 800 C could be assigned to an impurity in this industrially produced zeolite, perhaps iron species. The small peak at 340 C with [ 0.5N 1.8 ] indicates the reduction of a small portion of the total nickel content, whereas further reduction follows only above 1000 C. With samples [0.5N 4.8] and [ 2.ONi4.8 ] a considerable amount of Ni\" is reduced, at temperatures corresponding to nickel oxide. Finally, [ 0.3Pt 1.8 ] only gives a relatively small TPR peak, suggesting an essential thermal decomposition of the impregnated Pttv compound already during the calcination at 500 C. In Table 2, quantitative results of TPR and pulse chemisorption are summarized. As will be shown later on by the results of IR spectroscopy, besides N 2+ also Ni+ cations could be observed in the reduced samples. However, it cannot be decided on the basis of the present results, whether these Ni+ ions were already formed during the reduction of the samples with hydrogen or only during the IR experiments 45 C 410 C [0.3Pt1.8] x10 ------------------- ----- 260 C 350 C [2.ONi4.8] 330 C ' [0.5N 4.8] ~0 450 C m C _' 340 C [0.5N 1.8] H 890 C1020 C x10 [H-ZSM-5] 890 C 1020 C x10 25 ,25 200 400 600 800 1000 1000 Tl C Fig. 1.

Assuming cubic particles. by the interaction with carbon monoxide, like e.g. the formation of Rh(CO)2+ from zeolite supported Rh3 + [ 23 ] . Therefore, for determining the degrees of reduction by TPR, only the reduction of N 2+ to NP could be taken into account. Nickel in the reduced catalyst [0.5N 1.8] almost exclusively exists in the oxidized state. As known, bulk N 0 is reduced at about 300 C [ 24] . The observed stabilization of oxidized nickel should be due to an interaction with H-ZSM-5. This must be an exchange of nickel ions, probably Ni(OH)+, with the protons of the Br nsted sites in the pore system. The low reducibility means a remarkable difference to exchanged nickel in Y zeolites. Depending on the conditions, more or less high proportions of nickel ions in Y zeolites could be reduced to the metallic state [ 15-18 ] . This will be discussed later on, on the basis of a model assuming `hidden positions', which are hardly accessible for nickel ions, and assuming a stabilizing role of these positions. Unlike [ 0.5N l .8 ] , the two catalysts impregnated at pH 4.8 ([ 0.5N 4.8 ] and [ 2.ONi4.8] ) contained 75% of their total nickel content as metallic NP after reduction. Only 25% remained in the ionic state and were able to exchange Br nsted protons. The results of oxygen pulse sorption indicate a low dispersion of the metallic nickel. The average nickel particle size was estimated to be 14 and 17 nm, respectively. Such large particles should be localized exclusively on the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites. The reduced sample [0.3Ptl.8] contained only metallic platinum, the main part of which had been formed already during the calcination step. Hydrogen chemisorption revealed a low dispersion of the metal, with the metallic surface area (0.11 In 2/g cat.) being still lower than for the nickel samples impregnated at pH 4.8 (0.15 and 0.48 m2/geatalyst, respectively). It is known that a calcination at higher temperatures produces large platinum crystallites, which are located on the external surface of the zeolite, e.g. [ 25 ] . This is, surely, the case with the sample [0.3Ptl.8], too. The relatively low external surface area of the zeolite crystallites and the weak interaction of platinum species D.L. Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 301 with the silicon rich zeolite surface should have avoided a higher dispersion of the metal. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide Adsorption of carbon monoxide as a probe molecule was followed by IR spectroscopy to characterize the state of nickel. Relevant studies of nickel supported on other carriers have shown that carbon monoxide is adsorbed on metallic nickel in a linear form with wavenumbers between 2100 and 2000 cm-' and in a bridged form with wavenumbers from 2000 to 1900 cm-', e.g. [26-29]. With high metal dispersions and especially on zeolites as supports, also surface carbonyl species of positively charged nickel have been reported, with wavenumbers higher than that of the stretching vibration of linearly bound carbon monoxide [21,27,30-37] . As an example, Fig. 2 shows the IR spectrum of carbon monoxide adsorbed on [2.ONi4.8] in the region of the CO stretching vibrations. The band at 2210 cm-' can be assigned to Ni2+ ions coordinated to cation sites in the zeolite pores [3137 ] . The carbon monoxide adsorbed on these sites is rather weakly bound and is desorbed already by decreasing the carbon monoxide pressure. The bands at 2136 and 2092 cm-' appear in all experiments as a doublet with a constant intensity ratio (2136:2092) of ca. 0.5. These results indicate a dicarbonyl species with the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching CO vibration at 2136 and 2092 cm-', respectively. With a centre of gravity at 2114 cm-', this species should be assigned to a cationic Ni(CO)z+ complex, localized at cation positions. This has already been proposed by other authors [ 34-37 ] .

Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 carbon monoxide adsorbed on framework atoms of the zeolite support [44]. The small broad band centred at ca. 2030 cm-' and the band at ca. 1903 cm- t can be attributed to carbon monoxide adsorbed on metallic nickel in a linear and a bridged form, respectively [ 26-29 ] . All bands could be observed with the sample [ 2.ONi4.8 ] (curve a) and with the sample [ 0.5N 4.8 ] (curves b and c) after calcination and reduction. However, for the sample [ 0.5N 1.8 ] (curve d), the only one prepared at lower pH, no bands due to carbon monoxide adsorbed on nickel species are observed. The intensity of the band assigned to metallic nickel (1905 cm -1) decreased. However, this band is significantly disturbed by overlapping lattice vibrations of the zeolite, preventing an unambiguous decision. The complete disappearance of all the bands indicating ionic nickel is very surprising. As known from the TPR results (Table 2), this sample contains 97% ionic nickel, whereas the sample [0.5N 4.8] contains only 25% ionic nickel. The only conclusion can be that after impregnation at pH 1.8 the nickel ions are not accessible for the probe molecule carbon monoxide. As will be discussed later on, we suggest that these nickel ions are located in hidden positions of the framework. Such positions were found for nickel in Y zeolites [ 32] and postulated for copper in H-ZSM-5 [ 38 ] . 3.2. Catalyst acidity IR of adsorbed ammonia The bands at 1616 cm- t and 1460 cm-1, not depicted in this paper, were taken as a measure for coordinatively bound (Lewis sites, `L sites') and protonated (Br nsted sites, `B sites') ammonia, respectively [ 54 ] .

This means that with the samples impregnated at higher pH, lowerBr nsted acidities were found than one would have expected according to the original acidity of the H-ZSM-5 and to degree of exchange. Nickel in these catalysts predominantly exists as large particles on the external surface of the zeolite (see foregoing chapter), as nickel oxide before reduction and as metallic nickel after reduction. We assume that aggregates of nickel species block some zeolite channels and reduce the accessibility of the interior of the zeolite crystals for ammonia molecules. This results in too low acidity values. This explanation could be connected with the surprisingly low catalytic activity. Lewis sites could only be found in the samples impregnated at pH 4.8, with their number being proportional to the nickel content (Table 3, column 2) . These samples predominantly contain reducible nickel species outside the zeolite crystallites, but additionally some unreduced and perhaps also some reduced nickel species inside the channel system. Surprisingly, we could not find any coordinatively bound ammonia in [0.5Ni1.8], although there is no doubt about the presence of nickel cations in this catalyst. This behaviour emphasizes the qualitative difference between the samples prepared at different pH values. OH vibration spectra The OH vibration spectra of our parent zeolite, not depicted, exhibited the known sharp bands of the terminal silanol groups (3740 cm-') and of the bridged OH groups (3612 cm-'). Moreover, a shoulder at 3660 cm-' was observed, which can be assigned to OH groups on non-framework alumina [ 39 ] . Hence, our catalysts contain a certain amount of non-framework alumina, which should be able to interact with the surface of metallic nickel in a specific way. 3.3. n-Hexane conversion Fig. 3 summarizes results of n-hexane conversion on the catalysts A-E. The bar graphs symbolize yields of aromatics, alkanes and alkenes, respectively. [H-ZSM-5J In nitrogen atmosphere, activity and selectivity of this basis zeolite correspond to what was found by other authors under the conditions chosen [ 3,4 ] , i.e. comparable yields of cracking products and aromatics as well as comparable amounts of alkanes and alkenes within the cracking products. 304 D.L.

Catalytic results of n-hexane conversion at 500 C in nitrogen and in hydrogen atmosphere, WIF= 4.7 gm, h/molhm ,e. Compared to nitrogen, in hydrogen atmosphere, an essentially higher total activity and an increased yield of cracking products, but a markedly decreased yield of aromatics is observed. If assuming exclusively the protolytic carbonium ion mechanism and/or the classic carbenium ion mechanism [40,41 ] as reaction pathways, this behaviour could not be explained. An action of hydrogenating impurities should be excluded, because we found no significant differences with H-ZSM-5 samples of differing purities [ 42 ] . So we assume that with increased hydrogen partial pressures additional reaction pathways become important, as was proposed recently [43]. [0.5Nil.8J This catalyst almost exclusively contains nickel as Ni2+ ions. But small amounts of Ni could be detected by TPR. Compared to [ H-ZSM-5 ] , its Bronsted acidity is weakly decreased by the ion exchange. According to this slight decrease of the acidity, the total activity of the catalyst is practically equal to that one of H-ZSM-5, but the selectivity towards aromatics is higher than with the unmodified zeolite. This proves to be true in hydrogen atmosphere as well as in nitrogen atmosphere. [0.5Ni4.8J and [2.ONN.8J Nickel in these catalysts is mainly localized outside the zeolite crystallites as metallic nickel. Only a minor part of nickel could exchange Br nsted protons as nickel cations. The catalytic results are remarkable because of the decreased total activities and extremely high selectivities towards aromatics. This is best seen with the catalyst [ 0.5N 4.8 ] . Another striking catalytic result is the very low cracking activity of the catalysts, this feature becoming especially obvious by comparison with [0.3Pt1.8].

H ng et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 305 [0.3Pt1.81 The metal content of this sample is relatively low. The reduced metal has a low dispersion and should therefore be localized outside the channel system. Hence, a remarkable change of the acidity of the zeolite by the modification procedure could not be expected and in fact was not observed. Consequently, the total activity of [ 0.3Pt1.8 ] in nitrogen atmosphere corresponds well to that of the unmodified zeolite, but, as in the case of [0.5Ni1.8], the selectivity of aromatization is significantly increased at the expense of cracking products. This can easily be explained by the dehydrogenation activity of platinum. n-Hexane can undergo a direct dehydrocyclization or primary cracking products can be dehydrogenated to alkenes, which can be oligomerized, and converted into aromatics thereupon. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that platinum additionally acts as a catalyst for the recombination and desorption of H species after a `long distance hydrogen back-spillover' from the inner to the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Such action of metals and semiconductors has been proposed [7,8]. In hydrogen atmosphere, the platinum modified catalyst surprises by an extremely high total activity. The total activity is distinctly the highest of all of the catalysts investigated and almost reaches a value threefold that of the total activity in nitrogen atmosphere. This is mainly due to a multifold increase of the cracking activity. Obviously, the small amount of low dispersed platinum has such a remarkable hydrogenolysis activity. 4. Discussion 4.1. Role of `hidden positions' Among the characterization results of our catalysts, three findings with the sample [ 0.5Ni 1.8 ] are remarkable and need interpretations: (i) Nickel in this catalyst, which was impregnated at pH 1.8, is practically unreducible below 800 C, unlike nickel e.g. in Y zeolites [ 34 ] . (11) With ammonia as a probe molecule, unexpectedly no Lewis sites, i.e. no coordination of ammonia molecules to nickel ions, has been found. (iii) With carbon monoxide as a probe molecule, unexpectedly no coordination of carbon monoxide molecules to nickel ions has been found. Each of these `negative' findings can be assumed to be caused by a special localization of the nickel cations, leading to low reactivity and/or low accessibility for probe molecules. Hence, it seems reasonable to look for a more comprehensive explanation for the three results in this direction. Recently, reduced reactivity of transition metal cations towards carbon monoxide as a probe molecule has been observed in Y zeolites [ 33 ] as well as in ZSM-5 [ 44 ] . `Hidden positions' were proposed to be responsible for the low reactivity of 306 D.L. Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 nickel and copper ions, respectively. As hidden positions, e.g. sodalite cages or hexagonal prisms in the case of Y zeolites and positions in five-membered units, aside the main channel system, in the case of ZSM-5 zeolite have been proposed. In the following we shall try to explain the differences in the nickel state and in the nickel localization in our catalysts in terms of a model involving the assumption of nickel cations in hidden positions and involving the well-known dependence of the aggregation state of transition metal ions in aqueous solutions on pH. (0.5Ni1.8J At the low pH 1.8, relatively small monomeric nickel ions exist in nickel nitrate solutions in a hydrated state [45 ] . Presuming the existence of hidden positions for nickel ions in H-ZSM-5 as mentioned above, these relatively small monomeric ions could enter the channel system and could preferentially occupy these hidden positions, because they could reach highly coordinated and especially stable states there. It can be imagined that nickel ions in such stable positions are hardly reducible and give TPR signals only at very high temperatures, possibly after the thermal decomposition of the zeolite structure. Moreover, they are protected there against the attack of probe molecules like ammonia or carbon monoxide. Hence, it is understandable that with the catalyst [0.5Nil.8] no IR peaks of ammonia and carbon monoxide, coordinated to nickel ions, could be observed. [0.5N4.8] and [2.ONi4.8] In contrast to the sample [0.5Nil.8], the major part of the nickel in these two catalysts, impregnated at the higher pH 4.8, is reducible and is surely located outside the channel system after reduction. Obviously, most of the nickel cations were not able to reach and to occupy the stabilizing hidden positions. It is well known that the tendency of transition metal cations to form dimeric or polymeric `polyoxo cations' increases with increasing pH. At pH values higher than 3.5, nickel salt solutions predominantly contain tetrameric nickel ions [ 45 ] . The accessibility of the main channel system for such large ions should be heavily reduced, perhaps be impossible. Hidden positions surely are inaccessible for such ions. Hence, as has been found, the major part of the nickel ions remains outside the main channel system. Only a minor part, perhaps nickel ions of a lower degree of aggregation, can enter the main channels, but cannot occupy hidden positions. During the calcination, nickel oxide crystallites are formed on the outer zeolite surface from the tetrameric nickel ions outside the channels and perhaps also from some nickel species, which migrated from the main channels to the outer surface. These nickel oxide crystallites are reducible and therefore detectable by TPR. The TPR of the minor part of the nickel, which remained inside the main channels, but outside the hidden positions, results in different oxidation states between Ni2+ and Ni . All these species are accessible for probe molecules like ammonia or carbon monoxide. Therefore these samples exhibit IR bands of coordinatively bound D.L.

The scheme in Fig. 4 illustrates the nickel species and their position in catalysts impregnated at pH 1.8 and pH 4.8, respectively. 307 4.2. Action of the nickel species (H-ZSM-51 In our basis catalyst [ H-ZSM-S J , Br nsted protons are available to catalyze the conversion of n-hexane. n-Hexane molecules are cracked, according to the carbonium ion mechanism [40] and/or to the classic carbenium ion mechanism [41 ]. Olefinic intermediates are oligomerized, cyclisized and finally dehydrogenated to aromatics [ 1-5 ] . As a result, in nitrogen atmosphere comparable amounts of aromatics and cracking products are detected, in accordance with former investigations (4]. In hydrogen atmosphere, increased cracking and decreased aromatization is observed. This is compatible with the recent investigation [ 43 ) . (O.SNil.BJ The [O.SNi1.8] catalyst, which was impregnated at low pH, contains nickel predominantly as nickel ions in hidden positions. Its catalytic properties differ from [H-ZSM-S] by an increased selectivity for aromatics, in nitrogen as well as in hydrogen atmosphere. It is well known that some metal cations are able to activate alkane molecules. By hydrogen abstraction they act as dehydrogenating Lewis sites. According to refs. [ 46-49 J , this can be described as follows: (1) H abstraction on a Lewis site: CnHzn+z + L - CnHzn+ t + L-H+ (2) Lewis site regeneration: 308 AL Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 L-H+ +H+ ---)L+H2 (3) Proton release from the formed carbenium: C,H2n+ I +C~H2n + H+. Nickel ions should react in the same way. Therefore, a synergism between Bronsted sites and nickel Lewis sites could increase the dehydrogenation activity and consequently the aromatization. It should be explained, why the nickel ions, although located in hidden positions, nevertheless are active in catalysis. In face of our IR results, we proposed above that the formation of surface complexes with carbon monoxide and ammonia is sterically hindered. However, one could imagine that the spacious requirements for the hydrogen abstraction and the corresponding nickel-hydrogen complex are lower than for the formation of complexes with carbon monoxide or ammonia. Therefore, the nickel ions could take part in the catalytic reaction. Moreover, the reaction temperature is considerably higher than the temperatures applied with the CO-IR and TPDA investigations. [0.5Ni4.8J and 12.ONi4.8J These catalysts [ 0.5N 4.8 ] and [ 2.ONi4.8] were impregnated at higher pH. Nickel in these catalysts mainly exists as relatively large metallic nickel particles outside the zeolite crystallites. A minor part of nickel exists as ions and is located at accessible positions in the main channels. In the following, we will try to explain three remarkable results of the catalytic characterization of these two samples, namely: (i) the decreased total activity of these samples, (ii) the extremely high aromatization selectivities, especially of [0.5N 4.8] and (iii) the obviously missing hydrogenolysis activity of nickel in these catalysts. The total activity of [ 0.5N 4.8 ] in nitrogen atmosphere is distinctly below that which one would have expected taking into account the Br nsted acidity of this sample: The expected B site concentration, estimated under the assumption of an exchange of protons by Ni(OH) + ions, amounts to 0.60 mmol/g (Table 3, column 5) and differs hardly from the corresponding value of the original H-ZSM-5 (0.62 mmol/g). Hence, the low total activity of [0.5N 4.8] cannot be due to the loss of acidity by the ion exchange. The catalytic activity of [ 0.5N 4.8 ] is even smaller than could be estimated on the basis of the B site concentration measured by NH3IR (0.47 mmol/g; Table 3, column 3), although this value is probably too low because of pore blocking. The low total activity is all the more surprising considering the presence of nickel species, which should be able to give an additional contribution to the original catalytic activity of the basis zeolite H-ZSM-5. The cracking activity of [0.5N 4.8] is extremely low. Comparing this minimum cracking activity with that of the unmodified [H-ZSM-5], which contains only B sites, one gets a clue for that portion of the total activity connected with the B sites inside the nickel modified catalyst. This amount seems to be rather low. Hence, one D.L. Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 309 can suspect that the interior of the zeolite crystallites is only to a minor degree accessible for hydrocarbon molecules. In accordance with our explanation for the unexpectedly low Bronsted acidity of the samples [ 0.5N 4.8 [0.5N4.81 and [2.ONi4.8], it seems plausible to assume that pore blocking by nickel species is responsible for the reduced accessibility of the main channel system and for the low total activity. Assuming an only low portion of B site catalyzed activity (see above), the nickel species outside the zeolite crystallites must essentially contribute to the total activity. This is easily explained by the assumption that the reduced nickel on the outer surface of the zeolite particles is very active in a stepwise dehydrogenation and final dehydrocyclization of n-hexane. The most striking catalytic feature of the catalysts impregnated at pH 4.8 is their low (or missing) hydrogenolysis activity in hydrogen atmosphere, especially if compared with that one of the platinum modified sample [ 0.3Pt l .8 ] . Metallic nickel is a typical hydrogenolysis catalyst and its metallic surface area in [0.5N 4.8] (0.15 m2/g) and in [2.ONi4.8] (0.48 m2/g) is even higher than that of [0.3Pt1.8]. Nevertheless, the hydrogenolysis activity of [ 2.ONi4.8 ] must be, if any, several times lower than that of [0.3Pt1.8]. One must conclude that the surface of the reduced nickel in these samples is modified in a specific manner. Obviously the surface remained able to catalyze structure insensitive reactions like dehydrogenation, but lost its ability to catalyze structure sensitive reactions like hydrogenolysis. It is well known that nickel aluminate species are hardly reducible and that aluminate species can decorate the surface of nickel crystallites, in that way changing their properties [ 20,24,33,50,51 ] . In [ 20,24] , we assumed that such a decoration is responsible for diminished hydrogenolysis activity. In our [0.5N 4.8] catalyst, nickel as well as non-framework alumina exist. Thus, it can be suspected that traces of nickel aluminate species are formed under calcination conditions. These species can decorate the surface of the nickel crystallites formed during the catalyst reduction, generating an `ensemble effect'. By this effect, large nickel ensembles, able to catalyze the structure sensitive hydrogenolysis, are destroyed. But the structure insensitive dehydrogenation is hardly influenced. Because of the missing competing hydrogenolysis, the nickel surface is especially active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, supplying the reaction mixture with alkenes, as precursors of aromatics, very effectively. As an alternative to the above geometric interpretation, a modification of nickel by the formation of nickel-proton adducts like in metal/H-Y systems [52,53], resulting in an electron deficient state of the metal, cannot be excluded. Nickel might have lost its hydrogenolysis activity by this electronic interaction. Further efforts are necessary to clear, whether such electronic interpretation can also be applied to metal/H-ZSM-5 systems with higher Si/Al ratios. 310 D.L. Hoang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 295-311 5. Conclusions -The impregnation of H-ZSM-5 with nickel nitrate leads, depending on pH of the impregnation solution, to different states of nickel, with the catalytic properties being significantly influenced by these states. - Ni/H-ZSM-5 catalysts impregnated at low pH contain nickel ions, which are unreducible and not detectable by the probe molecules carbon monoxide and ammonia. Nickel causes an increased aromatization selectivity. Interpretation: At low pH, monomeric nickel ions exist in nickel nitrate solutions. These are able to exchange Br nsted protons and to enter narrow hidden positions aside the ZSM-5 main channels. In these positions, they reach a stable coordination and are hardly reducible. The coordination with carbon monoxide and ammonia is sterically hindered, but not with hydrogen. Therefore these nickel ions can act as dehydrogenating Lewis sites, resulting in an increased aromatization. - Ni / H-ZSM-5 catalysts impregnated at higher pH predominantly contain large metallic nickel crystallites outside the zeolite crystals, besides a minor portion of ionic nickel inside the channels. The selectivity to aromatics of these samples is extremely high. Interpretation: At higher pH, the nickel ions exist as large tetrameric polyoxo cations and are not able to enter the stabilizing hidden positions. The extremely high aromatization selectivity is caused by several reasons. Metallic nickel catalyzes a direct aromatization of n-hexane via a stepwise dehydrogenation and final dehydr yclization. Moreover, the catalytic action of the cracking B sites inside the zeolite channels seems to be decreased, due to some pore blocking by metallic nickel. Finally, metallic nickel could possibly promote the portion of acidcatalyzed aromatization by a `long distance hydrogen back-spillover'. - The metallic nickel outside the zeolite crystals lost its hydrogenolysis activity, probably as a consequence of an `ensemble effect', caused by aluminium species, which decorate the metallic nickel surface, or by the formation of metal-proton adducts, being unable to catalyze hydrogenolysis reactions.

Nickel containing H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by impregnation with nickel nitrate at pH 1.8 and 4.8. The catalysts were characterized by infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and ammonia, by temperature-programmed reduction as well as by chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen. The conversion of n-hexane served as a catalytic test reaction. Impregnation at pH 1.8 leads to nickel ions exchange of BrØnsted sites in the channel system. These are hardly reducible and are not detectable by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Aromatization is increased. This is explained by the presence of ionic nickel Lewis sites, active in dehydrogenation. With impregnation at pH 4.8, tetrameric nickel ions exist, not able to penetrate into the channels, and nickel is mainly located outside the channels as metallic nickel. The selectivity to aromatics is still higher. This should be due to the action of metallic nickel, which promotes the direct dehydrocyclization. The hydrogenolysis activity of metallic nickel is suppressed.

        "dc:description": "Nickel containing H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by impregnation with nickel nitrate at pH 1.8 and 4.8. The catalysts were characterized by infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and ammonia, by temperature-programmed reduction as well as by chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen. The conversion of n-hexane served as a catalytic test reaction. Impregnation at pH 1.8 leads to nickel ions exchange of BrØnsted sites in the channel system. These are hardly reducible and are not detectable by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Aromatization is increased. This is explained by the presence of ionic nickel Lewis sites, active in dehydrogenation. With impregnation at pH 4.8, tetrameric nickel ions exist, not able to penetrate into the channels, and nickel is mainly located outside the channels as metallic nickel. The selectivity to aromatics is still higher. This should be due to the action of metallic nickel, which promotes the direct dehydrocyclization. The hydrogenolysis activity of metallic nickel is suppressed.",
