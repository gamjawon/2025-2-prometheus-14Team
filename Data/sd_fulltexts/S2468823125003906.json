Understanding the effect of rare-earth (RE) metal content in rare-earth zirconate (REZrO) catalysts is one of the essential issues for developing an efficient catalyst for the vapor-phase dehydration of 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO). By examining the relationship between the formation rate of unsaturated alcohols, the primary product in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, and the RE content, along with analyzing various catalytic properties, we can gain insight into how RE content influences the catalytic activity of REZrO. It is predicted that the change in RE content in the REZrO catalysts affected catalytic activity by altering the density of the oxygen defect, which provides the active site for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. The poisoning experiment by the use of CO2, 2,6-, and 3,5-dimethylpyridine further demonstrates that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO proceeded over base sites (O2‒) and Lewis acid (metal cation) via a base-acid concerted mechanism.

Understanding the nature of the active sites will enable wider applications of a specific catalyst in organic transformation. Moreover, insights into the characteristics of these active sites can offer valuable information to enhance the catalyst's efficiency, ultimately improving its productivity. Rare-earth (RE) metal oxides and RE zirconates (REZrOs) have numerous applications in various areas, including electronics, dentals, and catalysis [1–3]. In the field of catalysis, in particular, RE oxides and REZrOs have been used as catalysts and catalyst supports in several reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogenation, deoxydehydration, and ethanol steam-reforming [4–11]. Our group has also employed RE oxides and REZrOs in the vapor-phase dehydration of butanediols (BDOs) [12–20] and the aldol condensation of 2,5-hexanedione [21]. These reports highlight the potential of RE oxides and REZrOs in catalysis. Therefore, studies to elucidate the nature of the active sites in these RE oxides and REZrO are imperative. Previously, we have reported that REZrOs are effective catalysts for converting BDOs, such as 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), and 3-methyl-1,3-butanediol, into their corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UOLs), such as 3-buten-1-ol (3B1OL) and 2-buten-1-ol (2B1OL) [17,22], and dienes, such as 1,3-butadiene (BD) [18,19] and isoprene [20]. Among these, cubic fluorite Y2Zr2O7 has been identified as the most efficient catalyst for dehydrating these BDOs. However, a detailed understanding of how the incorporation of RE into the ZrO2 lattice enhances dehydration remains elusive. Consequently, the need to clarify the role of RE in the dehydration of BDOs is ongoing. In this work, a series of REZrO catalysts (RE = Y, Ho, Dy, and Tb) were employed in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to its UOLs (Scheme 1 ). It was found that the RE content (x) ranging from 30 to 50 mol% generated the most efficient REZrO catalysts in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, regardless of the type of RE tested. Therefore, the detailed promotion effect of the RE in the REZrO catalyst was unraveled using YZrO as a catalyst model. The x value was correlated to the amount of acid and base sites and the formation rate of UOLs. In addition, the importance of these acid and base sites was examined by poisoning experiments using CO2, 2,6-, and 3,5-dimethylpyridine (DMP). We discovered that the correlation between x, acid-base concentration, and UOLs formation rate might originate from the formation of oxygen defect in YZrO crystal, which provides the active site for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Rare-earth zirconate (REZrO) catalysts were prepared using the hydrothermal method, according to the previous literature [20]. For example, yttrium zirconate, Y2Zr2O7, was prepared by dissolving Y(NO3)3·6H2O (3.244 g, 8.47 mmol) and ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (2.264 g, 8.47 mmol) into 50 cm3 of distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by adding 25 wt% of NH3 solution (ca. 10 cm3) under vigorous stirring. Upon the addition of 25 wt% of NH3, a white slurry was formed. This slurry was continuously stirred for another 10 min. The slurry was then hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 24 h using an autoclave vessel. The mixture was centrifuged, and the resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water three times. The precipitate was dried in air at 110 °C overnight, and the as-dried sample was calcined in air at 900 °C for 3 h. Other REZrO catalysts were prepared using a similar procedure, with only replacing the Y(NO3)3 with the respective rare-earth metal nitrate. The catalyst was denoted as xREZrO, where RE and x represent the rare-earth metal used and the content of RE in mol%. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Crystallinity of the xREZrO catalysts was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using D8 ADVANCE (Bruker). The specific surface area (SA) of the xREZrO was measured using self-made glass equipment. The acid and base properties of the xREZrO catalysts were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of adsorbed NH3 and CO2 (NH3- and CO2-TPD) using BELCATII (MicrotracBEL). A sample with the weight of ca. 0.05 g was pre-heated in a He flow at 500 °C for 1 h. The sample was then cooled down to 100 °C and the probe gas (NH3 or CO2) was introduced for 1 h. The physiosorbed gas was flushed with a He flow for 30 min. After that, the desorption of either NH3 or CO2 was monitored while the temperature of the sample was raised from 100 to 800 °C. The details of the procedure to obtain the TPD profile are described elsewhere [17,22]. 2.3 Catalytic test Vapor-phase dehydration of 1,4-BDO was performed using a fixed-bed top-down flow reactor at an ambient pressure. The catalyst with a weight (W) of 0.2 g was loaded into the reactor and pre-treated at the reaction temperature for 1 h in a flow of N2 gas. 1,4-BDO was then fed from the reactor top at a fed rate (F) of 1.6 g h‒1 using N2 as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.8 dm3 h‒1. The contact time (W/F), which is defined as the time taken for the reactant to reach the same weight as the catalyst, under this condition, was calculated to be 0.125 h. Liquid products were periodically collected every hour using an ice-water trap at 0 °C and were analyzed with gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP5050A, Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a 30-m capillary column (Inert Cap WAX, 0.32 mm inner diameter, GL-Sciences Inc.). They were also quantitatively analyzed using GC (GC-8A, Shimadzu Corp.) with a flame ionization detector and a 30-m capillary column (Inert Cap WAX, 0.53 mm inner diameter) together with 1-hexanol as the internal standard. Gaseous products, collected in a gas-tight syringe, were analyzed by an off-line GC (GC-8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 6-m packed column (VZ-7, GL-Sciences Inc.), while the N2 carrier gas was used as an internal standard. 2.4 Poisoning experiments To elucidate the role of the base site of the catalyst, a poisoning experiment with CO2 gas was performed using CO2 gas with a flow rate of 1.8 dm3 h‒1 instead of using N2 carrier gas. Meanwhile, the role of acid sites was determined by performing the poisoning experiment using 2,6- and 3,5 DMP, which were conducted as follows: The poisoning of acid sites was performed by co-feeding the 1,4 BDO with 5 wt% of either 2,6- or 3,5 DMP. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Dehydration of 1,4-BDO over xREZrO catalysts Initially, the performance of several xREZrO (RE = Y, Dy, Ho, and Tb) was investigated in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO at 325 °C and a W/F of 0.125 h. Fig. 1 a depicts the catalytic performance of xYZrO catalysts. The increase in x from 0 to 50 mol% increased the conversion of 1,4-BDO. However, further increments of x from 50 to 100 mol% decreased the conversion of 1,4-BDO. Notably, the change in x also affected product distribution. Fig. 1a reveals that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO mainly produced UOLs, with THF acting as the second major product. The trend of product selectivity was not in line with the conversion of 1,4-BDO. The selectivity to UOLs decreased with the increase in x from 0 to 20 mol% but further increments of x from 20 to 60 mol% increased the selectivity to UOLs. The selectivity to UOLs once again decreased upon the increment of x from 60 to 100 mol%. The trend in UOLs selectivity as a function of x was the opposite of that of THF. Thus, it can be assumed that the formation of UOLs and THF are competitive reactions. It is also worth noting that the UOLs mainly consisted of 3B1OL with a small percentage of 2B1OL, originating from the isomerization of 3B1OL (Scheme 1). Details of product distribution are summarized in Tables S1 – S4, and the time-course profiles of the reaction are displayed in Figs. S1 – S4. Previously, we have also correlated several other x with the catalytic activity of xYZrO catalysts in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO at a higher W/F. A similar trend was also observed, in which the catalyst with the highest catalytic activity was generated at x = 30 – 50 mol% [19]. Figs. 1b – 1d indicate that the catalytic performance trends of xDyZrO, xHoZrO, and xTbZrO are similar to those of xYZrO. The conversion of 1,4-BDO over xDyZrO, xHoZrO, and xTbZrO was maximized at x of 40 - 50 mol%, and it gradually decreased with further increment of x from 50 to 100 mol%. Product distribution in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO over xDyZrO, xHoZrO, and xTbZrO also resembled that of xYZrO, where THF was efficiently generated when the x was raised from 0 to 20 mol%, but it rapidly decreased with further increment of x from 20 to 100 mol%. Concurrently, the decline in the THF selectivity was accompanied by the increase in UOLs selectivity, showcasing that the addition of RE at x of 30 or above promoted the formation of UOLs. Fig. 1 also demonstrates that the change in x affects the SA of xREZrO catalysts. The change in SA follows a volcano shape with the maximum SA achieved at x = 30 mol%. Since the activity can be influenced by the SA of the catalyst, the activity of xREZrO was normalized by the SA. In addition, the desired product in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO is UOLs since they can be further dehydrated to BD. It should be noted, however, that all tested REZrO gave no BD under the conditions shown in Fig. 1, where the conversion of 1,4-BDO was below 50 %. The production of UOLs was then normalized by the SA of the respective catalyst to give the expression of UOLs formation rate. Fig. 2 exhibits the effect of x on the UOLs formation rate, while Tables S1 – S4 summarize the numerical data. The trend of UOLs formation rate as a function of x was similar to that of UOLs selectivity, with the maximum UOLs formation rate at x of 40 – 60 mol%. Notably, the UOLs formation rate over REZrO was not substantially different, implying that the intrinsic activity of these REZrO was rather similar. It is also worth noting that the influence of RE content, x, in all these REZrO catalysts on the catalytic activity was also identical. Previously, we have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of RE oxide was affected by the ionic radii of the respective RE [16]. Thus, different RE oxides give different catalytic activity due to their size. However, the difference in RE in the REZrO, which affected the size of the resulting REZrO, did not significantly affect the formation rate of UOLs. Therefore, ionic radii in the REZrO might not be the essential factor in determining the efficiency of REZrO. 3.2 Effect of RE content, x, on the crystal structure and acid and base properties Previous reports have suggested that the x in the REZrO influences the crystal structure of the REZrO [17,22,23]. The XRD patterns in Fig. 3 show that x affects the crystal phase of the xREZrO. The full range ptterns of 2 theta 10 – 80° are displayed in Fig. S5. The monoclinic phase of the ZrO2 crystal changes to a tetragonal phase with the addition of the RE at x = 10 mol%. The dominant peak shifted to the lower angle as the RE content increased from 10 to 100 mol%, implying that the gradual change of the crystal structure was highly influenced by RE content. At x = 30 – 50 mol%, the crystal structure of REZrO was cubic fluorite Y2Zr2O7 (PDF 01–074–9311, Fd-3 m, No. 277). This assumption is further confirmed by the Rietveld analysis of 50YZrO calcined at 1200 °C, which strongly suggests that the crystal structure of 50YZrO is defect cubic fluorite [17]. A further increment of x to 90 mol% resulted in a mixed structure of cubic fluorite and cubic bixbyite of pure RE oxide. These results also confirm a similar behavior of xYZrO that occurs in a previous report, where several other x values cause identical changes in crystal structure [19]. The gradual change of crystal structure due to the addition of RE has been reported as evidence that the RE was incorporated into the ZrO2 lattice [23]. Thus, the hydrothermal protocol in this work successfully incorporates Y into the ZrO2 lattice, and it did not result in a physical mixture between RE oxide and ZrO2. The incorporation of RE cations with different charges into the ZrO2 lattice resulted in a charge imbalance, which could generate an oxygen defect site. It is reasonable to assume that this defect site can be affected by the RE content. Fig. 3a shows that the crystal structure of xYZrO (x = 30 to 50 mol%) is cubic fluorite. However, further increments of x beyond 50 mol% result in a mixture of cubic fluorite Y2Zr2O7 (50YZrO) and bixbyite Y2O3 (100YZrO). Additionally, Figs. 1a and 2 indicate that the catalytic activity of xYZrO increases as x increases from 30 to 50 mol%. This improvement in catalytic activity is probably attributed to the change in oxygen defects due to the incorporation of Y into the ZrO2 lattice. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of xYZrO continues to rise even when x reaches 60 mol% (Fig. 2). However, the change in the catalytic activity of 60YZrO might not be influenced solely by the formation of oxygen defects, as the catalyst comprises a mixture of cubic fluorite and cubic bixbyite. Therefore, changes in the crystal structure could also impact catalytic activity. Regrettably, the extent to which the change in crystal structure affects the catalytic properties is challenging to quantify, and a definitive investigation can only be conducted for xYZrO where x is between 30 and 50 mol%. Fig. 4 a reveals the NH3-TPD of the xYZrO at x from 30 to 50 mol%. The total amount of acid concentrations of the 30YZrO, 40YZrO, and 50YZrO are 0.118, 0.109, and 0.129 mmol g‒1, respectively. The increase in the x from 30 to 50 mol% did not substantially alter the acid concentration of the xYZrO. Nevertheless, the change of x changes the distribution of the acid strength. Each of the NH3-TPD profiles of the xYZrO in Fig. 4a resembles a broad peak composed of several overlapping peaks, implying the presence of acid with different strengths. The shoulder peak at low temperatures diminished, while the one at high temperatures intensified as the x increased from 30 to 50 mol%. The deconvolution was then performed to clarify the effect of x on the acid and base distribution. The deconvolution clearly shows that the peak around 270 °C was intensified with the increase x from 30 to 50 mol%, where the deconvolution peaks at ca. 270 and 400 °C were defined as medium and strong strength sites, respectively. Simultaneously, the peak intensity located below 200 °C decreased. Therefore, it can be said that the rise of x increased the concentration of medium and strong acid concentration while reducing the concentration of weak acid sites A similar behavior was also found in the case of base sites, shown in Fig. 4b. The increment of x from 30 to 50 mol% intensifies the medium and strong base sites, as confirmed by the deconvolution result. Nevertheless, the total amount of the base site concentration slightly increased as the base site amounts of 30YZrO, 40YZrO, and 50YZrO were 0.071, 0.091, and 0.122 mmol g‒1, respectively. Thus, the increment of x increased the concentration of medium and strong base sites and also increased the concentration of the total amount of base sites. Fig. 5 shows the effect of x on the acid and base concentration of xYZrO catalysts, while Table S5 lists the numerical data. The total acid concentration has no obvious trend to the x in the xYZrO (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, the increase in x in the xYZrO increased the total base concentration. Considering that Fig. 4 also reveals that the increase in x seems to increase the concentration of medium and strong acid and base concentration, we also correlated the x of the xYZrO to the density of medium and strong acid and base sites. Fig. 5b clearly shows a linear correlation between the x in xYZrO and the density of medium and strong acid and base. This behavior is essential for the xYZrO since the dehydration of 1,4-BDO was performed at 325 °C, which implied that medium and strong acid and base sites might play a more prominent role than the weak acid and base sites. 3.3 Role of acid and base properties on the catalytic activity The x of the xYZrO affects the formation rate of UOLs (Fig. 2) and the acid and base concentration (Fig. 5). It can be assumed that the change in x affects the activity of the resulting xYZrO by affecting their acid and base properties. To further verify this assumption, poisoning experiments of acid and base sites by 3,5-DMP and CO2 were performed. Fig. 6 illustrates the poisoning effect of 3,5-DMP and CO2 on UOLs yield and formation rate. The presence of CO2, which can hinder the access to the base site, strongly decreased the UOLs yield and formation rate in all x tested (Fig. 6). This finding implies that the base sites play an essential role in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. Similarly, the presence of 3,5-DMP, which can hinder the access to acid sites, reduced the UOLs yield and formation rate, indicating that the acid sites of xYZrO were also essential in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. It should be noted, however, that the hindrance to base sites declined the catalytic activity of xYZrO more severely than the hindrance to the acid sites. Hence, the base sites in xYZrO probably played a more pivotal role in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. Fig. 6b clearly shows that the formation rate of UOLs is almost proportional to x. This finding indicates that the active site in the cubic fluorite structure is simply influenced by the Y content. This result also implies that the active sites, which are hindered by CO2 and 3,5-DMP, originated from the incorporation of Y3+. Thus, the acid-base sites, which are necessary for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, are strongly promoted by the presence of Y3+ in the ZrO2 lattice structure Even though the NH3-TPD and poisoning by 3,5-DMP can show the presence and the importance of the acid site, they failed to demonstrate whether Brønsted or Lewis acid sites (BAS and LAS) play a key role in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. For this reason, we also performed a poisoning experiment using 2,6-DMP, which has been reported to hinder access to LAS while leaving the BAS accessible [24,25]. Fig. 7 a shows the change in the conversion of 1,4-BDO over 50YZrO in the presence of CO2, 2,6-, and 3,5-DMP. Similar to the result in Fig. 6, the presence of 3,5-DMP and CO2 reduced the conversion of 1,4-BDO. However, the hindrance to BAS due to the poisoning by 2,6-DMP did not affect the catalytic activity of 50YZrO, suggesting that the BAS did not participate in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. This result also implies that the poisoning experiment using 3,5-DMP, which can hinder the access to BAS and LAS [25,26], mainly disrupts the LAS. The results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrate that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to UOLs over xYZrO proceeded over their LAS and base sites. It has been mentioned that the value of x significantly affects the crystal structure of xYZrO (Fig. 3), and the crystal structure of xYZrO at x of 30, 40, and 50 mol% was cubic fluorite. Furthermore, the Rietveld analysis also confirmed that the crystal structure of 50YZrO calcined at 1200 °C is defect cubic fluorite, Y2Zr2O7. Referring to this, we illustrate the crystal of Y2Zr2O7 using VESTA3 [27], and the (111) plane of Y2Zr2O7 is depicted in Fig. 8 . The incorporation of Y3+ into the ZrO2 lattice creates a charge imbalance between Y3+ and Zr4+, leading to the generation of oxygen defects. These oxygen defects expose the cations (Y3+ and Zr4+), which act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), and the O2‒ ions, which serve as base sites. On this (111) plane, one of eight O2‒ is missing [22]; thus, the density of the oxygen defect can be geometrically calculated to be 1.07 nm‒2 using the unit cell constant of a = 0.519878 nm [17]. This value is comparable to the density of the strong and medium base sites of 1.7 nm‒2 (Table S5). Considering that the oxygen defect originates from the incorporation of Y3+, the rise in x results in a greater number of oxygen defects, thereby increasing the number of exposed LAS and base sites. Consequently, the increase in x from 30 to 50 mol% increased the catalytic activity of xYZrO, as more exposed LAS and base sites are available. This assumption is also corroborated by the fact that the poisoning experiment using CO2, 2,6- and 3,5-DMP clearly showed that the base sites of O2‒ and LAS, i.e., Y3+ and Zr4+, acted as the active site in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. The results of the poisoning experiment clearly show that the base sites played a more essential role in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO (Fig. 6). Even though the presence and the importance of acid sites have been elucidated by NH3-TPD and poisoning experiments, they might not be the active sites for the formation of UOLs from 1,4-BDO. Moreover, previous reports have suggested that the acid sites are responsible for the formation of THF rather than UOLs [28]. Similar to the previous work, we consider that the main role of the LAS, i.e., Y3+ and Zr4+, was the anchoring site for an OH group of 1,4-BDO [29]. Meanwhile, the base sites are responsible for the abstraction of protons from 1,4-BDO, which is essential for the formation of UOLs. In summary, the origin of the active sites in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO over YZrO is the oxygen defect, which is promoted by the incorporation of Y3+ into the ZrO2 lattice structure. This oxygen defect exposes cations (LAS) and O2‒ anions (base), which are essential for the formation of UOLs from 1,4-BDO. 4 Conclusion The incorporation of RE, such as Y, Dy, Ho, and Tb, into the ZrO2 lattice structure influenced the catalytic activity of the resulting xREZrO catalyst for the vapor-phase dehydration of 1,4-BDO to UOLs. It was found that the x ranging from 30 - 50 mol% generated the most efficient REZrO catalysts. XRD profiles indicate that the xREZrO with x of 30 - 50 mol% had a defective cubic crystal structure. The catalytic investigation using xYZrO (x = 30, 40, and 50 mol%) as a catalyst model revealed that the x affected the catalytic activity of the YZrO catalyst by altering the concentration of medium to strong acid and base sites. Further confirmation from poisoning experiments using CO2, 2,6-, and 3,5-DMP demonstrated that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO proceeded via a base-acid concerted mechanism involving both LAS (Y3+ and Zr4+) and base site (O2‒). The incorporation of Y into the ZrO2 lattice structure causes a charge imbalance, leading to the formation of oxygen defects. These oxygen defects expose cations (Y3+ and Zr4+) and O2‒, which serve as the active sites for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. The x could influence the number of oxygen defects, i.e., acid and base sites, thereby affecting the catalytic activity of the xYZrO catalyst. A similar correlation between x and the catalytic activity for several other RE tested, including Dy, Ho, and Tb, implies that the creation of active sites in these REZrO is identical to the one in xYZrO.

        "dc:description": "Understanding the effect of rare-earth (RE) metal content in rare-earth zirconate (REZrO) catalysts is one of the essential issues for developing an efficient catalyst for the vapor-phase dehydration of 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO). By examining the relationship between the formation rate of unsaturated alcohols, the primary product in the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, and the RE content, along with analyzing various catalytic properties, we can gain insight into how RE content influences the catalytic activity of REZrO. It is predicted that the change in RE content in the REZrO catalysts affected catalytic activity by altering the density of the oxygen defect, which provides the active site for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. The poisoning experiment by the use of CO2, 2,6-, and 3,5-dimethylpyridine further demonstrates that the dehydration of 1,4-BDO proceeded over base sites (O2‒) and Lewis acid (metal cation) via a base-acid concerted mechanism.",
