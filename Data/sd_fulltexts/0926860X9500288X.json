Depend- ing on silicon and vanadium content, the as-synthesized molecular sieves were thermally stable or unstable up to 400-450. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, IR, TG and sorption methods. The oxidation and ammoxidation reactions of toluene and benzylalcohol were carried out over SAPO, VAPO and VSAPO catalysts, The catalysts were selective in the oxidation and ammoxidation of toluene. The yield of benzonitrile was 20-92 wt.-%. The vanadium and Sb203 modification enhances the yield of benzonitrile substantially. The benzoic acid was not observed in the products. In the ammoxidation of benzylalcohol, the yield of benzonitrile was 18%-74%. The selectivity of benzonitrile was comparatively lower. The reaction scheme is discussed. We report silico-aluminophosphate, VSAPO and TiSAPO, as-synthesized molecular sieves, as a new and novel class of oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts.

Kulkarni et al, / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 59-74 oxidation reactions have been reported over vanadium- and titanium silicalites [16-18]. We have reported the ammoxidation of ethanol to acetonitrile over silico-aluminophosphate (SAPO-40-type) with high yield (> 98%) and selectiv- ity. Silico-aluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieves are mild and selective oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts. The ammoxidation of picolines over SAPO resulted into the corresponding nitriles with low yields ( < 40%) and high selectivity [19,20]. The main purpose in using modified molecular sieves in these ammoxidation reactions is to lower the exothermicity and to reduce the high-boiling products in the reaction using the shape selectivity. In the presently known processes, the ammoxidation of toluene has been carried out over non-uniform porous V205 or VOPO4 supported over various supports like Al203, A1203-SIO2, TiO2, Cr203, ZSM-5, zeolites [21-40], etc. The catalysts were promoted by Sb, Bi, Fe, K, etc. compounds. The yield of benzonitrile vary from 70% to 92%. In this paper, we report the synthesis, physicochemical characterization and the oxidation and ammoxidation of benzylalcohol and toluene over thermally stable and unstable silico-aluminophosphates (SAPO), vanadium-silico- aluminophosphate (VSAPO) and vanadium-aluminophosphate (VAPO) cata- lysts of molecular sieve type. 2. Experimental The SAPO, VSAPO and VAPO type crystalline and amorphous catalytic materials are hydrothermally synthesized using aluminium sulphate, phosphoric acid, sodium silicate, vanadium pentoxide, with or without sodium chloride and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPA), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBA), tri-n-propylamine (TriPA), di-n-propylamine (DPA) for SAPO(TPA), SAPO(TBA), SAPO(TriPA) and SAPO(DPA), respectively [41]. The synthesis was carried out at 200 for 24-80 h at autogenous pressure. All chemicals are LR or AR grade. The synthesis procedure is reported by Borade and Clearfield [41]. X-ray diffraction patterns were taken usin~ Phillips instrument with Fe K a (h= 1.9359 A) and Cu Ka (h= 1.5418 A) radiation from 20=4 to 70. FT-Infrared spectra were recorded using KBr pellet on Nicolet 740 model (USA). The thermogravimetric studies have been carried out in the temperature range of 50 to 600 of SAPO(TPA), VSAPO(A) and VAPO(B) catalysts. The ammonia was adsorbed from 1% ammonia in argon and detected by TCD. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia over SAPO(TPA), VSAPO(A), VAPO(B), VAPO(C) and VAPO(D) catalysts was carried out from 26 to 500 in presence of helium. The n-butylamine (nBA) sorption was carried out over VSAPO(A), VAPO(D), SAPO(TPA), VAPO(C), VAPO(B) and SAPO(TBA) in the temperature range of 25 to 400. The catalysts were S.J. Kulkarni et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 59-74 61 activated at 450 for 1 and 2 h for NH3 and nBA sorption, respectively. The nBA was sorbed at 30 mm pressure of nBA and the desorption of nBA was carried out in the temperature range of 25 to 400 under 10-5 Torr pressure. The temperature programmed reduction was carried out in the 9.2 vol.-% U2 in argon in the temperature range of 25 to 500 over VAPO(C), VAPO(D) and V205 catalysts. The reaction was carried out using a fixed-bed, down-flow, tubular pyrex reactor with 20 mmid. The amount of catalyst was 4 g and activated at 420 for 4 h, before reaction. The reaction was carried out in the temperature range of 300-400, 0.25 to 1 h i weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). The reaction mixture was fed from the top using a syringe pump (Sage Instruments, USA). The product was cooled using ice-cooled water and collected at the bottom. The ammonia and air were passed through the calibrated manometer and flow-rates were measured. The products were analyzed by SE-30 (30%) and OV-17 columns. The analysis was confirmed by mass spectrometry and GC-mass spectrometry. The mass balance was 90%. 3. Results and discussion The chemical composition of the catalysts is given elsewhere [19,20]. All the as-synthesized catalysts are crystalline materials. The typical XRD of SAPO(37-type), SAPO(TriPA), SAPO(DPA), SAPO(TBA), VSAPO(TBA) and TiSAPO(TBA) catalysts are given in Figs. 1 and 2. The catalysts with AI/Si > 10 are not thermally stable above 400, under our experimental conditions. The IR spectra of SAPO-37, SAPO(DPA), SAPO(TriPA), SAPO(TBA), VSAPO(TBA) and TiSAPO(TBA) catalysts are reported in Figs. 3 and 4. The IR spectra show characteristic patterns corresponding to zeolite molecular sieve. The thermo- gravimetric (TG) analysis of SAPO(TPA), VSAPO(TPA-A) and VAPO(TPA-B) corresponding to the removal of tetrapropylamine (template) are depicted in Fig. 5. Most of the template is removed up to 450-500 [41]. The weight loss due to template in the temperature range of 25-500 was 10.8, 9.9 and 6.3 wt.-% for SAPO(TPA), VAPO(B) and VSAPO(A) catalysts, respectively. The number of tetrapropylamine cationic species corresponding to this weight loss were 3.782. 102 3.493. 1020 and 2.229- 1020 molecules per g, respectively. The occlusion of template and the temperature at which the template decomposes compare to literature, indicating that the as-synthesized material was of molecu- lar sieve type which may be destroyed during the removal of template. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia for SAPO(TPA), VSAPO(TPA-A), VAPO(B), VAPO(C) and VAPO(D) catalysts is depicted in Fig. 6. The amount of ammonia desorbed (molecules per g) in the different temperature ranges from various VAPOs and SAPO(TPA) is given in Table 1. The total number of ammonia molecules sorbed were 8.7. 1019, 5.3. 1019. 62 S.J. Kulkarni et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 59-74 I ,0 ;0 ,; ,0 2e Fig. 1.

The trend corresponding to the acidic strength of catalysts is as follows SAPO(TPA) > VSAPO(A) = VAPO(C) --- VAPO(D) > VAPO(B). The NH3-TPD curves also showed the same trend and indicates that SAPO(TPA) is the most acidic with respect to number and strength of acidic centres. The incorporation of vanadium does not increase the acidity. Borade and Clearfield [41] reported the TPD of ALPO-5, SAPO-5, -11, 34 and 37 molecular sieves. The medium-strong acidic centres are present over SAPOs. Su and Barthomeuf [42] reported that the heating of SAPO-37 at 700 results into the transformation of some acidic centres to stronger acidic centres than those in HY. The results of sorption of nBA over SAPO and VAPOs are given in Table 2. The total number of nBA molecules per S.J.

The acidity trend for various catalysts is similar in case of nBA and ammonia. During the desorption of nBA some interesting observa- tions were made. In case of SAPO(TPA) and VAPO(D) catalysts, the desorption of nBA up to 300 takes place depending upon acidic strength of active centres. In case of VSAPO(A), VAPO(B), VAPO(C) particularly, nBA was decomposed in the temperature range of 100-200. The loss of catalyst weight was observed in case of VSAPO(A) and VAPO(B) and VAPO(C) catalysts, if heated up to 300 after the sorption of nBA. This was due to the removal of 64 S.J.

This observation may be possible only in case of the catalyst being very active in oxidation and ammoxidation reactions, indicating the presence of labile framework oxygen which can be exchanged with atomic oxygen. The tempera- ture programmed reduction of VAPO(C), VAPO(D) and V205 was carried out in presence of 9.2 vol.-% H2 in argon. For all the three materials, the peak position was the same at ca. 450. This indicates that vanadium in these catalysts cannot be reduced easily and is stable under the reducing conditions. 3.1. Ammoxidation of toluene The ammoxidation of toluene was carried out over SAPO and VSAPO molecular sieves at 400 and 0.5 h- ] WHSV and the results are given in Table 3. The maximum yield corresponding to the time on stream is reported. The yields of benzonitrile were 21.6, 28.7, 61.2 and 8.9 wt.-% at 23.1%, 29.8%, 63.5% and 18.3% conversions over SAPO-37, VSAPO-37, VSAPO(TriPA) and SAPO(DPA) molecular sieves, respectively. The ammoxidation of toluene was carried out in presence of ammonia and air at 420 and 0.5 h-] WHSV over amorphous (thermally unstable) SAPO catalysts and the results are depicted in Table 4. The catalysts reported in Table 4 were amorphous with a probable presence of microcrystallinity. The materials were synthesized by the same hydrothermal method and as-synthesized catalysts were crystalline showing mostly molecular sieve structure with some phase impurities. The yields of benzonitrile were 23.5, 56.7, 47.6, 43.5 and 30.2 wt.-% at 25.2%, 67.8%, 50.9%, 46.6% and 31.5% conversion over SAPO(TPA), SAPO(TriPA), SAPO(DPA), SAPO-37 and SAPO(TBA) catalysts, respectively.

The as-synthesized catalysts reported were crystalline composites. After calcination at 420 for 4 h, the catalysts in Table 5 became mostly amorphous with a probable presence of microcrystallinity. The yields of benzonitrile were 94.7%, 61.9% and 68.9% at 97.3%, 71.9% and 73.3% conversion over SbzO3-VSAPO(A), VSAPO(A) and VAPO(B) catalysts, respectively. The vanadium and antimony showed strong promoting effect in enhancing the ammoxidation activity. The influence of temperature over the ammoxidation activity of Sb203- VSAPO(A) was studied and given in Table 6. The yields of benzonitrile were 53.1, 69.4 and 94.7 wt.-% at 71.5%, 70.5% and 97.3% conversion at 350, 380 66 S.J.

In case of non-zeolitic, conventional catalysts, the formation of carboxylic acid and CO2 was observed. On the other hand, in case of VSAPOs or VSAPO-type materials, carboxylic acid or amide was not formed as a result of oxidation. This leads to the improvement of selectivity of benzonitrile and exothermicity is reduced.

The lower yields of benzalde- hyde indicates that the oxidation step is rate controlling in the ammoxidation of toluene. 3.2.

The selectivity for benzonitrile was reduced due to the acid catalysed reactions like dealkylation. The results of ammoxidation of benzylalcohol over vanadium modified SAPO/APO catalysts are given in Table 11. The yields of benzonitrile were 73.7, 53.7 and 51.5 wt.-% at 92.0, 75.1 and 91.8% conversions over VSAPO(A), VAPO(D) and Sb203-VSAPO(A), respectively, at 420. This indicates that incorporation of vanadium increases the ammoxidation of benzylalcohol. On the other hand, the promoting effect of Sb203 was more pronounced in toluene ammoxidation. In case of benzylalcohol ammoxidation the by-products were more, 12% to 32%, than those observed in toluene reaction. This may be because of the VSAPO catalysts showed mild and selective in toluene ammoxi- dation, while strongly active and less selective in benzylalcohol reaction. The oxidation of benzylalcohol was carried out at 420 and 0.5 h- I WHSV over SAPO and VSAPO catalysts and results are given in Table 12. The yields of benzaldehyde were 49.1, 35.2 and 28.4 wt.-% at 59.1, 51.5 and 48.5% conversion over SAPO(TBA), SAPO-37 type and VSAPO(TPA-D) catalysts, respectively. It is evident from the data in Tables 11 and 12 that TiSAPO is S.J.

Reaction scheme and mechanism The reaction scheme considered in the reaction of toluene to benzonitrile is depicted in Fig. 7. In our studies, we have not observed benzoic acid or amide as by-products. In the oxidation of toluene in air and absence of ammonia, benzoic Route - 1 ~ CH3 IO| ~ ~CHO NH3 I0|~ [~COOH Route - 2 Route - 3 Fig. 7. Reaction routes considered in the reaction of toluene to benzonitrile. 72 S.J. Kulkarni et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 59-74 acid was not observed. Similarly, in the reaction of toluene with ammonia, in the absence of air, benzylamine was not observed. This indicates that Routes 1 and 3 are not valid. We have observed the formation of benzaldehyde as reported. So, benzonitrile is formed from toluene and also benzylalcohol via the formation of benzaldehyde and corresponding imine and Route 2 is recommended. In case of non-zeolitic, mixed oxide catalysts, the presence of benzoic acid, CO2 and benzoate ion as intermediate has been established [21]. In case of SAPO catalysts, BrCnsted (and Lewis) acidic centres [41], due to the substitution of silicon in place of phosphorous, mild basic centres which are discussed by Akolekar et al. [43] and probably oxygen vacancies are the active centres. In case of VSAPO, tetrahedral V4+, -VO4-, acidic centres and oxygen vacancies are the active centres. While in case of VAPO catalysts V4+, -VO4- species, Lewis acidic centres (mainly) and oxygen vacancies are the active centres in the oxidation and ammoxidation reactions. The catalysts are multi- functional. The presence of V4+, VO2+, V204 and -VOa-species is predicted by ESR data, particularly [19,20]. The test reaction of cyclohexanol has been carried out over some SAPO and VSAPO catalysts [44,45]. The formation of cyclohexene and cyclohexanone indicates the presence of acidic and basic centres, respectively. The presence and nature of acidic centres in HSAPO-37 is reported by Su and Barthomeuf [42]. Kim and Chon [35] reported the ammoxidation of toluene over Cu-Na-ZSM-5. They have discussed the changes in the reaction pattern for ammoxidation of toluene in terms of the stability of (Cu~l(NH3(tol.)) and the mechanism differs compared to the non-zeolitic catalysts. The nature of vanadium species and the reaction mechanism have been discussed in the literature [21]. The formation of benzaldehyde from toluene occurs particularly on V4+, VO2+ or V204 type of species [29]. The presence of V4+ in VSAPO and VAPO catalysts have been confirmed by ESR studies [19,20]. On the other hand, the formation of benzoic acid from toluene occurs on V5+ or V205 species [29]. Another more important factor is the oxygen mobility and supply on the catalyst surface. Rizayev et al. [21 ] reported that the aromatic nitriles are produced as a result of the interaction of toluene, ammonia and active catalytic surface. The role of gas phase oxygen is to oxidize catalytic surface, i.e., to reduce V5+ to V4+ and fill the oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies are also filled by bulk oxygen [21], through diffusion. The layered structure present in the ammoxidation catalysts like V2Os-MoO3, V205-P205 or BiO3-MoO3 facilitates the diffusion of bulk oxygen to the external surface. Our VSAPO and VAPO catalysts are heteropha- sic and almost all the ammoxidation catalysts are having redox active centres and multifunctional. This indicates that along with the incorporation of vana- dium or titanium into the framework of SAPO; the impregnation, particularly stepwise or simultaneous, with strong metal-framework interaction in SAPO, should be the properly tailored ammoxidation catalyst. Due to the lack of specific and uniform geometrical structure in case of S.J. Kulkarni et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 59-74 73 non-zeolitic catalysts, the mechanism of alternate reduction and oxidation of the catalyst surface and oxygen migration at high temperatures (> 400) occur throughout the catalyst. This type of continuous variation of the catalytic surface may lead to rapid deactivation and sensitive to various parameters like pressure, temperature, etc. On the other hand, in general, zeolite framework is quite stable with respect to the redox conditions and oxygen is generally supplied to the surface from gas phase to the oxygen vacancies. Even the carbonaceous material deposited on the redox surface may be responsible for the ammoxidation activity [21], which is generally characterised by the increase in activity with time on stream. In addition, as a source of nitrogen ammonia reduces catalytic surface and reduces the strong acidic centres and helps in reducing side reactions in ammoxidation [21]. In absence of ammonia as a nitrogen source, the toluene deep oxidation may occur predominantly resulting into carbon dioxide. But, such possibility is very much reduced over promoted silicoaluminophosphates due to its mild and medium strength activity in the presence of ammonia. Thus, SAPO, VAPO and VSAPO catalysts, thermally stable or unstable molecular sieves, synthesized by hydrothermal method, are good and a new class of oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts.

Oxidation and ammoxidation of toluene and benzyl alcohol over silico-aluminophosphate and metal-silico-aluminophosphate catalysts The co-authors dedicate this paper to Dr. A.V.

The silico-aluminophosphate (SAPO), vanadium-aluminophosphate (VAPO) and vanadium-silico-aluminophosphate (VSAPO) catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Depending on silicon and vanadium content, the as-synthesized molecular sieves were thermally stable or unstable up to 400–450°C. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, IR, TG and sorption methods. The oxidation and ammoxidation reactions of toluene and benzylalcohol were carried out over SAPO, VAPO and VSAPO catalysts. The catalysts were selective in the oxidation and ammoxidation of toluene. The yield of benzonitrile was 20–92 wt.-%. The vanadium and Sb2O3 modification enhances the yield of benzonitrile substantially. The benzoic acid was not observed in the products. In the ammoxidation of benzylalcohol, the yield of benzonitrile was 18%–74%. The selectivity of benzonitrile was comparatively lower. The reaction scheme is discussed. We report silico-aluminophosphate, VSAPO and TiSAPO, as-synthesized molecular sieves, as a new and novel class of oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The silico-aluminophosphate (SAPO), vanadium-aluminophosphate (VAPO) and vanadium-silico-aluminophosphate (VSAPO) catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Depending on silicon and vanadium content, the as-synthesized molecular sieves were thermally stable or unstable up to 400–450°C. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, IR, TG and sorption methods. The oxidation and ammoxidation reactions of toluene and benzylalcohol were carried out over SAPO, VAPO and VSAPO catalysts. The catalysts were selective in the oxidation and ammoxidation of toluene. The yield of benzonitrile was 20–92 wt.-%. The vanadium and Sb2O3 modification enhances the yield of benzonitrile substantially. The benzoic acid was not observed in the products. In the ammoxidation of benzylalcohol, the yield of benzonitrile was 18%–74%. The selectivity of benzonitrile was comparatively lower. The reaction scheme is discussed. We report silico-aluminophosphate, VSAPO and TiSAPO, as-synthesized molecular sieves, as a new and novel class of oxidation and ammoxidation catalysts.",
