Summary Mixed copper-chromium oxides are good catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated organic compounds. Our previous study of the hydrogenation of light unsaturated molecules in the gaseous phase has been extended to heavier molecules in the liquid phase. The selectivity in monohydrogenation is excellent (100%) for conjugated dienes but much lower for a,/?-unsaturated carbonyls. This is due to adsorption competition between the last starting molecules and some primary products such as unsaturated alcohols. The a-unsaturated alcohols react with hydrogen via four different routes: (a) hydrogenation; (b) hydrodehydroxylation; (c) nucleophilic substi- tution; and (d) bimolecular elimination. The hydrogenation site is an octahe- drally coordinated Cu\"1' ion with two anionic vacancies and an attached hydride ion (H~). The Cr3'1' ion in the same environment is probably the active site for reactions (b), (c) and (d). These results are discussed and compared to those obtained in homogeneous systems and striking similarities are demonstrated. Introduction Copper-chromium mixed oxides are very good catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of conjugated dienes into monoenes [I], and the trend to monohydrogenation depends essentially on steric and electronic effects. Unfortunately, the selectivity decreases in the hydrogenation of a,/?-un- saturated carbonyls [2]. The reason is the formation of primary products *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 171 (substituted allyl alcohols) which are strongly adsorbed and can compete with the starting carbonyls [3]. Previous results were obtained with light unsaturated molecules in the gas phase. The aim of the present work was to carry out a similar study in the liquid phase with some heavier molecules of particular economic impor- tance in the fragance industry. A good knowledge of the catalytic mechanism is important to increase the selectivities. In the liquid phase, the <x,fS -unsaturated compounds are easily reduced by any system capable of generating atomic hydrogen such as Na/NHa [4] and Zn/HCl [5], but these systems lead to numerous by- products. In the case of citral hydrogenation, for example, some decarboxy- lation reactions are observed in a basic medium [6] and the same occurs for p-menthene cyclization in an acidic medium [7]. Hydrides such as NaBH4 and A1L1H4 have a good functional selectivity but a low monohydro- genation selectivity [8]; with these hydrides, a-unsaturated carbonyls are hydrogenated to yield a mixture of allylic and saturated alcohols. The catalytic system described in this work seems to present more interesting advantages. Experimental Catalyst and reagents Copper-chromium oxide (Cu/Cr = 1) has been prepared by the copre- cipitation of copper and chromium hydroxides with an ammonia solution, followed by thermal decomposition in a flow of nitrogen up to a final temperature of 580 K, according to a previously described procedure [9a]. The catalyst was then reduced with hydrogen at 413 K overnight. U-grade hydrogen and helium were obtained from Air Liquide; residual water and oxygen were eliminated by using liquid nitrogen cooled traps and a copper furnace. Organic compounds (Fluka, purum grade) were used after further purification such as fractional distillation on molecular sieves. Catalytic tests The catalytic reactions were carried out in a thermostatted all-glass reactor with a side entrance to remove the samples. The tests were per- formed with 300 mg of catalyst, 0.5ml of substrate in 5ml of decalin at a temperature of 413 K. The very small size particles of the catalyst and the independence of the initial rates of hydrogenation on the shaking regime prove that hydrogen diffusion does not control the reaction. The products were analyzed on a Girdel-75 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 100 m x 0.2 mm i.d. Carbowax 20 M capillary column for oxygenated compounds and an SE 30 column for hydrocarbons. 172 Results Hydrogenation of polyunsaturated compounds Polyenes The very good monohydrogenation selectivity obtained with light con- jugated and jS-conjugated dienes [1] is confirmed on heavier molecules such as myrcene (I) and ocimene (II) (Table 1) [9b].

''Reaction conditions: liquid phase, 413 K, 1 atm pressure. Myrcene simply undergoes monohydrogenation and leads to a mixture of 1,2-, 3,4'- and 1 ^'-addition products. The 1,2-addition product predominates in accordance with Lebedev's rule [10] as in isoprene hydrogenation in the gas phase [1]. The isolated double bond Cg==C7 always remains unhydrogenated. 173 Ocimene undergoes the same monohydrogenation at the start of the reaction, but the 1,2-addition product (an <x,fS -conjugated diene) slowly evolves under the reaction conditions employed. In this case, 15% of mono- enes are present at 100% conversion of the triene because one of the primary product (a ^-conjugated diene) reacts further. Unsaturated carbonyls 0\"- CH=CH-C H=0 ;=0 (III) (IV) (V) Citral (III), cinnamaldehyde (IV) and cyclohexen-2-one (V) were em- ployed in this case. Hydrogenation of the ethylenic double bond or the aldehyde group converts citral to citronellal and nerol, and cinnamaldehyde to dihydrocinnamic aldehyde and cinnamic alcohol (Figs. 1 and 2). The saturated products citronellol and 3-phenylpropanol appear before complete consumption of the starting compounds. The hydrogenation of cyclohexen-2-one yields only one primary product, viz. cyclohexanone, and complete hydrogenation only occurs after the total consumption of cyclohexenone in the reaction medium.

Cyclohexen-2-ol (VIII) is converted to cyclohexanone by isomerization, in a similar manner to that observed in the hydrogenation of cyclohexen-2-one. The hydrogenation of cinnamic alcohol seems to be more complicated since hydrocarbons are observed among the products (Fig. 4). Discussion Selective hydrogenation. Active sites in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis Under the experimental conditions employed in this work, 1,3- and 1,4-dienes are monohydrogenated whereas the isolated ethylenic double bonds remain unreactive as demonstrated by the hydrogenations of myrcene and ocimene. Hexa-l,5-diene (biallyl), in which the double bonds can be considered isolated, is also unreactive. These results confirm the high mono- hydrogenation selectivity already observed with light conjugated dienes on the same catalysts [1]. 176 The behavior of a,/?-unsaturated carbonyls is different, irrespective of the size of these molecules, with a general hydrogenation pattern as shown in Scheme 1. Selectivity in monohydrogenation depends on the substituents on Scheme 1. the sp2 carbons (Table 2). When an alkyi group is attached at the 62 position as in cyclohexen-2-one and methyl vinyl ketone, selectivity lies in the medium range and the ratio of 1,4- to 1,2-hydrogenation is very high. In contrast, 1,2-addition is favoured by the presence of an alkyi group at the Cy or 64 positions; in this case, the corresponding allylic alcohol is formed and the monohydrogenation selectivity decreases. These results can be explained by comparing the nucleophilic charac- ters of the substrates and primary products. For monoenes this character is very weak, but is much higher for 1,3-dienes. Monoenes do not absorb on the catalytic sites while the monohydrogenation selectivity is very high for conjugated dienes. Oxygenated molecules, such as aldehydes and allylic alcohols, have a sufficient nucleophilic character to be adsorbed on the catalyst and to react with hydrogen. As such, they can compete with a-unsaturated carbonyls. Since, oxygenated molecules are the primary prod- ucts of the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyls, the monohydrogenation selectivity of such molecules is weak. Nucleophilic interactions of this kind are well known in homogeneous catalysis [12], the catalysts which are mainly used nowadays being transition metal hydrides (TMH) which readily form labile hydride complexes in solu- tion [13]. For example, in the reduction offumaric acid, the hydrido Ti-olefin complex intermediate leads to a a -alkyi complex of olefin insertion into the metal hydride bond [14] (Scheme 2). 177 TABLE 2 Selectmties in the hydrogenation of a,/?-unsaturated carbonyl compounds at 50% conversion of starting molecules on Cu-Cr oxide catalysts* Reactant molecules Monohydrogenation 1,4-/1,2-selectivity (%) Hydrogenation ratio ^ ^'^=0 100 a 95 a 92 45 86 60 \"Reaction conditions liquid phase, 413 K, 1 atm pressure With these TMH, the monohydrogenation selectivity of polyunsaturated compounds depends largely on the type of metal employed. With the sub- strates used in this study, for example, the extent of 3,4-addition observed in the hydrogenation of citral in presence of a rhodium (I) complex was 97% [15]. In contrast, copper hydride favours 1,4-addition of hydrogen to a,^-un- saturated carbonyl compounds [16], in a similar manner to the heterogeneous Cu-Cr oxide catalyst. ,..

Tanaka and Okumara have also proposed similar sites on TMO as a prerequisite to some complexes used in homogeneous catalysis [18]. For these various reasons, we have proposed previously [1, 2] that surface copper ions in an octahedral environment might be the precursor (C site) of active sites in copper-chromium oxides. After reduction, the hydro- genation site (CH site) is the one shown in Scheme 3; it consists of a CvL+ H~ pair containing two anionic vacancies. 13 o H H , - +- i;o 0 Cu 0 - Cu' 0 o 'o C Site CH Site a ^ H H . 1 I : 3? 0-Cr D 0-Cr n O7I 0/1 \"0 0 C Site CH Site Scheme 3. This weak electrophilic, reactive site will only adsorb strong nucle- ophilic reagents. That is not the case with isolated ethylenic bonds which are unreactive, whereas conjugated dienes, polar carbonyl compounds and ally lie alcohols are strong enough to interact with these active sites. Accordingly, the monohydrogenation selectivity for conjugated dienes such as myrcene and ocimene is very high (Table 1) but is low for a,/?-unsaturated carbonyls, particularly when the amount of substituted allyl alcohol is large as for citral (Table 2). The industrial importance of allylic alcohols requires a more accurate study of these molecules. Different reaction pathways in the hydrotreatment of allylic alcohols With mixed copper-chromium oxide catalysts, allylic alcohols are not only hydrogenated but also isomerized and dehydroxylated. For example, while nerol and cyclohexen-2-ol are isomerized (Fig. 3), cinnamic alcohol is isomerized and substantially dehydroxylated (Fig. 4). Since these reactions 179 do not occur on copper hydride, the proposed active site may be a chromium ion associated with a hydride ion and two anionic vacancies (Scheme 3) [11]. Thus, the copper-chromium oxide acts in the same way as homogeneous catalysts through the formation of metallic hydrides; it consists of two active metallic ions, Cu'1' and Cr34\", with a number of hydride groups located either in a vacancy associated with a single ion, or in a shared bimetallic vacancy (BMV) [19]. The copper ion leads to addition reactions while the chromium ion is involved in other reactions such as nucleophilic substitution. These behaviours may be interpreted using the Hard and Soft Acid Base (HSAB) theory, taking into account the general equilibrium equation, M H where M\"1' is the metal cation. Copper being a 'soft acid metal' shifts the equilibrium to the left, favouring hydrogenation reactions. In contrast, chromium which is a 'hard acid metal' shifts the equilibrium to the right, forming stable hydrides. In the cases under discussion, only a concerted mechanism is possible in which hydrogen (H~) is exchanged with an anionic part of the substrate.

An allylic migration then occurs with the formation of a n -bonded metal species which successively releases the isomerizated or dehy- droxylated substrate (Scheme 4). This mechanism is similar to the Sy2' mechanism in a homogeneous phase, resulting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution with double-bond migration: Y-+>C=C C>-X . Y C C=C<+X- The same mechanism has been proposed by Campelo et al. for the liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of several a,/?-unsaturated alcohols on a rhodium-supported catalyst [20]. The picture is different when the double bond is unable to migrate and a normal S^, mechanism is possible. This is demonstrated by the behavior of a number of aromatic alcohols which are sufficiently nucleophilic to be adsorbed on the catalyst without hydrogenation of the aromatic ring (Table 3). In fact, these alkylphenyl carbinols, are only dehydroxylated to the TABLE 3 Products of the hydrogenation of aromatic alcohols over Cu-Cr oxide catalysts\" Reactant Product molecule (^-CH-CHa 0-CH2-CH3 OH ^CH3 /CH3 ^>-CH-CH 0-CH2 CH I ^CHa ^CHa OH ii-CHi-CHy, ^-CHz-CH, OH ^CHa /CHa 0-CH2-C CH3 ^-CHi CH ^OH ^CHa \"Reaction conditions: liquid phase, 413 K, 1 atom pressure. 181 enough to be adsorbed, cyclohexyl carbinol, citronellol and 3-phenyl propan- l-ol, remain unchanged. Clearly, the mechanism cannot be considered simply as a dehydration because some alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol, cannot be dehydrated. Moreover, the formation of alkenyl derivatives of the type (f> C=C<, such as styrene, which would not be immediately hydrogenated under the experimental conditions, is not observed. We must therefore conclude that the reaction observed with these alkylphenyl carbinols is a normal bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (Sy2) as occurs in homogeneous systems (Scheme 4). Another interesting point to be compared with homogeneous phase systems is the fate of the double bond when it is unable to migrate and when the alcoholic group is sterically hindered. In a homogeneous phase, in- tramolecular dehydration of a-allyl tertiary alcohols takes place leading to the most stable conjugated diene. In the case of linalool (IX), in the presence of the Cu-Cr oxide heterogeneous catalyst, myrcene (I) and ocimene (II) appear to be the primary products with only a very small amount of myrcene being produced in accordance with the well-known Saytsev rule. The final product distribution is the same as that obtained in the hydrogenation of the trienes (I) and (II) (Scheme 5). These results are in accordance with a bimolecular elimination ( 2-like reaction), suggesting that the catalytic site for this reaction may be different from that proposed for substitution reactions; for example, an O2\" ion could play a fundamental role in this case since it occurs in the conversion of p -menthol into p-menthene over alumina [21]. Conclusions Selectivity in the monohydrogenation of dienes is very high when mixed copper-chromium oxide catalysts are used. In contrast, the hydrogenation of a,/?-unsaturated carbonyls generally leads to a low selectivity because of strong adsorption on the catalyst of some primary products such as substi- tuted ally lie alcohols. The production of these a-unsaturated alcohols results from the 1,2-addition of hydrogen which is influenced by electronic properties and by steric hindrance at the functional carbon positions. Numerous reactions induced by allylic alcohol formation are similar to those observed in the homogeneous phase. Generally, the S^'-like hydrode- hydroxylation is the main pathway followed by the unsaturated alcohols. 182 Myrcene (-H-0) 2 / / / dihydrolinalool l3 Scheme 5. Non-isomerizable alcohols lead to an S^-like reaction and tertiary alcohols undergo an 2-like dehydration reaction. The copper-chromium oxide catalysts consist, in fact, of two active metal ions, viz. Cu\"^ and Cr3'1' in an octahedral environment, together with some hydride ions and anionic vacancies. The copper ion leads to addition reactions whereas the chromium ion favours nucleophilic substitution. References 1 M. Daage and J. P. Bonnelle, Appl. Catal., 25(1985) 355. 2 R. Hubaut, M.

        "dc:description": "Mixed copper-chromium oxides are good catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated organic compounds. Our previous study of the hydrogenation of light unsaturated molecules in the gaseous phase has been extended to heavier molecules in the liquid phase. The selectivity in monohydrogenation is excellent (100%) for conjugated dienes but much lower for α,β-unsaturated carbonyls. This is due to adsorption competition between the last starting molecules and some primary products such as unsaturated alcohols. The α-unsaturated alcohols react with hydrogen via four different routes: (a) hydrogenation; (b) hydrodehydroxylation; (c) nucleophilic substitution; and (d) bimolecular elimination. The hydrogenation site is an octahedrally coordinated Cu+ ion with two anionic vacancies and an attached hydride ion (H−). The Cr3+ ion in the same environment is probably the active site for reactions (b), (c) and (d). These results are discussed and compared to those obtained in homogeneous systems and striking similarities are demonstrated.",
