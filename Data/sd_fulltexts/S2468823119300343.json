Graphical abstract Fresh CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 (CZYL) catalyst was synthesized via calcining at 600 ºC of relative precipitates obtained by co-precipitation and then aged at 700–1000 ºC. Afterwards, 10wt% MnO2 was further loaded on the fresh and 800 ºC-aging sample, respectively. The oxidation activity tests illustrate that the catalytic performance of CZYL catalysts firstly remains stable and then decreases with increasing aging temperature. Systematical investigations suggest that the amount of surface oxygen vacancies and O2 desorption ability of all these Ceria-Zirconia (CZ) based catalysts may be high enough to make little difference on their catalytic activity. On the contrary, it is found that the external surface area and low-temperature reducibility (<500 ºC) are the two major factors to influence the soot oxidation activity. Interestingly, the external surface area will does no difference when its value is above a critical point. Furthermore, only relatively larger distinction in low-temperature reducibility among catalysts will contribute to apparently various catalytic activity. Keywords Soot oxidation Catalytic activity Surface oxygen vacancies External surface area Low-temperature reducibility 1 Introduction The gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, compared to conventional port fuel injection vehicles, shows excellent fuel economy and drivability, which exhibits great applying prospects especially in U.S. and European markets. However, accompanied environmental problem connected with GDI engines is the increased particulate matter (PM) emission [1]. To eliminate the PM from GDI engines, a gasoline particulate filter (GPF) equipped with oxidation has been successfully developed in recent years [2]. To prevent the block of filter, ascending the GPF temperature even to above 600 °C periodically is a practical technique which will in turn make damage to GPF. Hence, a filter with catalyzed activity is proposed to lower the conversion temperature of soot and thus lengthen the lifetime of GPF. Therefore, it is necessary to develop catalysts with prominent catalytic performance applied to GPF. The GDI exhausts, in comparison with the diesel ones, comprise much lower content of oxygen and almost no NOx owing to the consumption of upstream three-way catalyst [3,4]. In order to achieve better conversion for soot in this working condition, ceria-based catalysts has been proposed in GPF for their superior oxygen storage capacity and redox property [5,6]. Furthermore, ceria-based catalysts are much more economical and practical compared with conventional noble-based catalysts. However, CeO2 alone is of little interest owing to its poor thermal stability and redox property. The surface area, redox property and oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 will decrease dramatically when subjected to high temperature environment. It is well recognized that modification CeO2 with Zr4+ will form a homogenous solid solution, which could simultaneously enhance its redox property, thermal stability and produce much more oxygen vacancies [7]. Recently, this enhancement could be further promoted with the simultaneous doping of two rare earth metal ions (Y, La, Pr, Nd) [8]. Hence, this kind of CZ-based catalysts may be excellent choice for soot oxidation. It is well-known that soot oxidation over ceria-based catalysts proceeds via Mars-van-Krevelen-like mechanism, from which two major factors are considered to have impact on the catalytic activity of soot oxidation: one is the generation capacity of active Ox − species, another is transfer efficiency of Ox − from catalyst to soot particles [9,10]. More specifically, the former factor is strongly linked with the redox properties and surface oxygen vacancies (VO-S) of catalysts for active Ox- mainly originates from the redox couple of Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+ [11,12], the later factor is related to catalyst-soot contact efficiency which is much higher under tight contact influenced by the textural properties of ceria-based catalysts than that under loose contact [13]. Bueno-López et al. [14] prepared La3+ doped CeO2 catalysts with much better catalytic performance and contributed this improvement to the increase of BET surface area and enhanced redox properties. Aneggi et al. [15] also found that the catalytic activity of ceria-based catalysts was closely related to oxygen storage/redox capacity and surface area. However, there were conflicting conclusions reported by Piumetti et al. [16] and Zhang et al. [17] that no reasonable proof was observed that the redox property and textural properties had impacts on the catalytic activity of soot oxidation for ceria-based catalysts. Hence, it is necessary to specify how these factors take effects to the catalytic activity. In this paper, via conventional co-precipitation and calcination at 600 °C of the precipitates, a highly thermally stable CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 (CZYL) quaternary catalyst was successfully synthesized. After that, the obtained fresh catalyst was aged at different temperature (from 700 to 1000 °C with interval of 100 °C). The catalytic activity of soot oxidation, structural property, oxygen vacancies, O2 adsorption/desorption ability, textural properties and redox property for these catalysts were thoroughly investigated. The influences of external surface area and low-temperature reduction property (＜500 °C) on soot oxidation were discussed in detail. In the end, the tentative mechanisms that these two factors make effect on the catalytic performance for soot oxidation were proposed. 2 Experimental sections 2.1 Preparation of CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 catalysts CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 mixed oxides with 45% CeO2, 45% ZrO2, 5% Y2O3 and 5% La2O3 in weight were prepared by co-precipitation. First of all, dissolving ZrOCO3 in concentrated nitric acid and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, La(NO3)3·6H2O and Y(NO3)3·6H2O in distilled water with required amount. All the salt solutions were stirred in one vessel to get the mixed salt solution. Then a required amount of H2O2 (30 wt%) was added to the above solution. After that, the obtained solution was co-precipitated with a buffer solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate with vigorous stirring. The pH value of the slurry was held at about 8.8 during precipitation process. Next, the above slurry was filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH of eluate didn’t change. And then the precipitate was dried at 80 °C overnight to get the dried sediment. Above dried sediment was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h to obtain the fresh sample denoted as CZ-600. CZ-600 was then aged at 700–1000 °C for 4 h to obtain different aged catalysts labeled as CZ-700, CZ-800, CZ-900 and CZ-1000, respectively. For further comparison, 10 wt% Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation method with Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution as precursor (10% Mn represents the weight proportion of MnO2). After impregnation, the catalyst powders were dried at 80 °C overnight and then calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. 2.2 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected by the Utima Ⅳ X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The characterization was operated under voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 mA, respectively. The scanning rang was 20°≤ 2θ ≤ 90° with a step size of 0.03°. The Vis-Raman spectra of the catalysts were obtained on LabRAM HR Laser Raman spectrometer (HORIBA JOBIN YVON, France). A diode pumped YAG laser of 532 nm excitation wavelength with power 73.5 mW was employed. In addition, the UV-Raman spectra were recorded on inVia reflex (Renishaw, UK) employing He-Gd laser with excitation wavelength of 325 nm. For each catalyst, the spectra acquisition was 2 accumulations in 30 s with spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on XSAM-800 electron spectrometer (Kratos, UK) with Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) as radiation. The operating condition is 13 kV and 20 mA. The binding energy of each element is corrected with C1 s peak at 284.6 eV as internal standard reference. The quantification analysis is based on the spectra of Ce3d, Zr3d, La3d, Y3d. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was used to characterize the textural properties on a Quadrosorb evo sorption analyzer (Quantachrome, USA) at 77 K. Prior to the experiment, the sample was degassed at 300 °C for 3 h under vacuum. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods were used to calculate specific surface area and pores size distribution, respectively. In addition, the external surface area is obtained via t-plot method. Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and O2-temperature- programmed desorption (O2-TPD) profiles were measured on a TP-5076 instrument (Xianquan Co. Ltd. Tianjin, China). Ahead of measurement, 100 mg catalyst was pretreated in N2 (20 mL/min) at 450 °C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature. Then the sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C under a flowing gas mixture of 5% H2-95% N2 (v/v) for H2-TPR measurements or 5% O2-95% N2(v/v) for O2-TPD characterization (20 mL/min). 2.3 Activity measurements As soot model, Printex-U (Degussa) with particle diameter of 17 nm was employed. For “tight contact” condition, 100 mg catalysts were mixed with 10 mg soot by a scraper for 10 min. To guarantee reaction controllable, 300 mg SiC powder was added in to dilute the mixture. The activities for soot oxidation of catalysts were accessed in a reaction apparatus equipped with temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) device. Firstly, above mixtures were stashed in a fixed-bed reactor set with soot dosage of 4 g/L. The reactor set was placed in a silica tube (12 mm i.d.) under continuous flow gas containing 1% O2/N2 with ultimate flow rate of 500 mL/min. Afterwards, the reactor was heated up from room temperature up to 700 °C with ramp rate of 5 °C /min. COx (CO and CO2), as outlet emissions from soot-TPO, were firstly transformed into CH4 by methanator and then detected by GC9790Ⅱ chromatograph (Fuli Co. Ltd. Zhejiang, China.) equipped with FID detector, in which 99.99% N2 was server as carrier gas. T10, T50 and T90 denoted the temperature at 10%, 50%, 90% conversion of soot, respectively. 3 Results 3.1 Catalytic activity for soot oxidation Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activity of soot oxidation with O2 over the fresh (CZ-600) and four aged catalysts (from CZ-700 to CZ-1000). Relative Tx (x = 10, 50 and 90%) values are listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that with increasing aging temperature from 700 to 1000 °C, the catalytic activity for soot conversion firstly remains stable and then decreases that is CZ-600 ≈ CZ-700 ≈ CZ-800 > CZ-900 > CZ-1000. Interestingly, CZ-600, CZ-700 and CZ-800 display almost the same catalytic activity though they may have different physicochemical properties. Thereof, the following characterizations will discuss the factors resulting in the sequence of catalytic performance for soot oxidation among these CZ-based catalysts. 3.2 Structural characterization The XRD spectra and relative amplifying diffraction patterns (2θ from 27° to 31°) for different catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Relative crystallite catalysts are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the fresh and four aged catalysts display the same diffraction peaks ascribed to fluorite-like cubic phase and no peak splitting is observed for any catalysts indicating the formation of homogeneous and thermally stable CZYL mixed oxides. Note that the reflection peak becomes narrower with the increment of aging temperature owing to the grain growth. However, the symmetric reflection peak have maintained even aged at 1000 °C, further implying that as-prepared CZYL catalysts are thermally stable and no evident phase separation occurs. From the amplifying patterns, it can be observed that the position of the main diffraction peak nearly doesn’t change even with the increase of aging temperature, further implying the structural stability of prepared catalysts [18]. It was reported that the CZ-based catalysts exhibited distinct Raman spectra features under different excitation laser lines. The detecting depth was gradually improved with increasing excitation wavelength, which could reflect the inhomogeneous distribution of defect species for CZ-based catalysts from surface to bulk structure [19,20]. The Raman spectra of different CZ-based catalysts employing ultraviolet (325 nm) and visible (532 nm) laser lines are displayed in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that as-prepared catalysts almost show the identical spectra regardless of treating temperature and excitation laser lines. The bands at about 314 cm−1 (Vis-Raman only), 465 cm-1and 610 cm-1 are ascribed to the pseudo cubic (tʹʹ) phase [21]. No characteristic band belonging to tetragonal (t) phase is observed, certifying that as-prepared CZYL catalysts are highly thermal stabile, consistent with XRD results. The value A610/A465 reflects the amount of oxygen vacancies caused by the substitution of Ce atom by Zr, Y and (or) La in the mixed oxide. The relationship of the value A610/A465 to the treatment temperature under UV and Vis excitation lasers is shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the values under UV excitation laser are much higher than that under Vis excitation laser. Li et al. [19] found that Vis Raman spectra could reflect both the surface and bulk information while UV Raman was more surface sensitive. For this reason, above phenomenon suggests there might be much more oxygen vacancies in the surface region that is VO-S. Under UV excitation laser, the value firstly increases and then decreases from CZ-600 to CZ-1000 that is CZ-800 > CZ-700 ≈ CZ-900 > CZ-600 > CZ-1000. However, from Vis Raman spectra, CZ-600 shows the largest value of A610/A465 and this value constantly decreases along with increasing aging temperature. So CZ-600 might have the highest amount of bulk oxygen vacancies (VO-b) while CZ-800 maybe has the largest content of surface VO-S. It was well-known that much bulk (or subsurface) oxygen defect would promote the mobility of oxygen and thus enhance the oxygen storage capacity and redox property of CZ-based catalysts [22,23]. Hence, the redox property of these five CZ-based catalysts may follow in the same order as the A610/A465 value under Vis excitation laser. 3.3 Surface oxygen vacancies and O2-TPD analysis XPS investigation is performed to reveal the chemical state of elements and elemental distribution for different catalysts and obtained patterns of Ce3d and O1s are exhibited in Fig. 5 . After deconvolution, Ce3d spectra, shown in Fig. 5(A), consists of eight peaks, among which those labeled as u belongs to Ce3d5/2 and others signed as v originates from Ce3d3/2. The couple peaks marked as u′ and v′ are ascribed to Ce3+ and the others corresponds to Ce4+ [24]. The spectra of Zr 3d, Y 3d and La 3d are shown in Fig. S1. Surface elemental concentrations of different catalysts are calculated according to normalized peak area of Ce3d, Zr3d core level spectra and obtained results are listed in Table 2 , in which the proportion of Ce3+ in Ce is calculated based on the ratio of summation with peak areas for Ce3+ to overall peak areas for all cerium species. As shown in Table 2, CZ-600 shows significantly the highest surface Ce/Zr ratio while the value for the other four aged catalysts is almost the same. This further illustrate that as-prepared CZYL catalysts have a relatively stable nanostructure as expounded in XRD and Raman results. Moreover, the surface Ce3+/Ce ratio, related to the concentration of VO-S [25,26], increases first and then decreases from CZ-600 to CZ-1000 consistent with the result of UV-Raman, indicating that surface oxygen vacancies might follow the same order. In addition, from O1s spectra in Fig. 5(B), two gaussian peaks located at c.a. 529.15 ev (O α) for O2− in the lattice and c.a 530.2 ev (O β) for O2− in the oxygen vacancy and (or) surface chemisorbed oxygen species [3,4]. The value of O β/Ototal can reflect the amount of oxygen vacancies and the order is the same as that of Ce3+/Ce value. Herein, the results from XPS analysis illustrate that the VO-S content of these CZ-based catalysts displays the sequence CZ-800 > CZ-900 ≈ CZ-700 > CZ-600 > CZ-1000. For CZ-based catalysts, it has been reported that a high density of Ce3+ and VO-S doesn’t mean a high catalytic activity for excessive surface oxygen vacancies may restrict the formation of active Ox −, while the catalyst with a mild concentration of VO has better performance [27,28]. In this study, however, there is no evident correlation between the amount of VO-S of CZ-based catalysts and catalytic activity. According to the results of XPS and Raman analysis, CZ-800 displays the highest amount of surface oxygen vacancies than CZ-600 and CZ-700, but they have similar catalytic activity. In addition, CZ-900 exhibits lower activity than CZ-600 and CZ-700 though it has similar or higher VO-S. Nevertheless, compared with the oxygen vacancies from XPS characterization, the density of VO-S for these five CZ-based catalysts is much higher than that reported in other works [27–29], so the relative minor discrepancy among them may not do any difference to their catalytic activity. It has been reported that large amount of VO-S would be beneficial to the adsorption/desorption of Ox − species [30,31]. Hence, in order to further investigate the VO-S, O2-TPD characterizations were carried out and obtained profiles are shown in Fig. 6 . Generally, for ceria-zirconia catalysts, there were three kinds of oxygen species on their surface labeled as α, β and γ. α O species desorbed at lower temperature below 300 °C belonged to ordinarily chemisorbed oxygen (O2 -1) while γ O species desorbed at higher temperature above 750 °C assigned to lattice oxygen. Besides, β O species desorbed at middle temperature were attributed to the oxygen chemically adsorbed (O-) on oxygen vacancies [32,33]. However, for all these five catalysts, only one asymmetric peak can be observed at around 110–122 °C indicating that there might be two types of desorbed oxygen species (α and β). No characteristic peak corresponding to γ O species are observed for any catalysts. Compared with the fresh sample CZ-600, the peak position of oxygen desorption slightly shifts to higher temperature with the increment of aging temperature, which might be owing to the constant decrease of specific surface area. However, the peak area below 500 °C, which reflects the relative amount of desorption oxygen, increases first and then decrease with increasing treatmrnt temperature. This tendency is consistent with that of VO-S concentration derived from the XPS and UV-Raman analysis. On the basis of Mars-van-Krevelen-like mechanism, CZ-based catalysts with high oxygen adsorption/desorption capacity would facilitate the migration of active Ox − which can enhance the catalytic activity of soot combustion. However, for the fresh and four aged CZ-based catalysts, almost unvaried peak temperature in O2-TPD profiles is observed with disparate desorption amount. The same consequence of O2 desorption amount below 500 °C as that of VO concentration manifests that the difference in O2-adsorption/desorption ability and VO-S content has no effect on their catalytic capacity among these five catalysts. 3.4 Textural properties results N2 adsorption-desorption is used to study the textural properties of as-prepared catalysts. The obtained SBET, SExt, total pore volume and average pore size are displayed in Table 3. No doubt that increasing aging temperature contributes to the constant decline of textural properties. From CZ-600 to CZ-800, the SBET and SExt value respectively drop about 40.3 m2/g (from 119.7 to 88.9 and then to 79.4 m2/g) and 15.7 m2/g (from 87.4 to 73.6 and then to 71.7 m2/g) while the average pore diameter changes a little (3.6 nm from 17.4 nm to 21.0 nm). From CZ-600 to CZ-800, the difference in SExt value that excludes the surface area contribution of micropores and small mesopores is much smaller than that of SBET, in which CZ-700 and CZ-800 even have similar SExt value. Moreover, from the pore size distribution displayed in Fig. 7 , CZ-600 has much more small and micro pores while CZ-700 and CZ-800 have no or little ones. All of these results illustrate that slightly higher temperature aging (700 and 800 °C) eliminates lots of micro and small mesopores (pore diameter < 10 nm) which contributes to the high BET surface area for CZ-600 and doesn't work for the contact with soot particles whose diameter are about 17 nm [19]. When unceasingly increases the aging temperature (900 and 1000 °C), the SBET and SExt value respectively drops about 50% (from 79.4 to 53.9 and then to 39.7) and 47% (from 71.7 to 49.5 and then to 37.9 m2/g) with little change in pore volume, while a large change is observed for their average pore size (11.2 nm from 21.0 to 32.2 nm). The further rapid decline in surface area (including external surface area) and sharp increase in pore diameter of CZ-900 and CZ-1000 are ascribed to the collapse of pore structure and drastic aggregation of particles under high temperature [18], which will greatly decrease the effective contact area. Regardless of increasing aging temperature, there is almost no change in the distribution of pore diameter higher than 25 nm (seen from Fig. 7) of four aged catalysts compared with CZ-600. These larger pores, which are beneficial to the entrance of soot particles, have much higher surface energy and can retain the collapse under high temperature treatment. From the results of cumulative pore volume, the pore volume of the pores with diameter larger than 25 nm can be obtained and the results are also shown in Table 3. Interestingly, there is no much difference in the pore volume of larger pores for these five catalysts. This result further illustrates that the large pore with diameter above 25 nm has been maintained. Therefore, the tiny variations in pore volume of larger pores (>25 nm) among these five catalysts indicates that the larger pores will not make difference to their contact efficiency. From above analysis, the difference of contact efficiency of these five catalysts may mainly depend upon the external surface which plays a great role on the contact with soot particles [34]. However, the activity consequence for soot oxidation of these catalysts is not consistent with that of their external surface area, in which CZ-600, CZ-700 and CZ-800 has identical catalytic activity. Of course, the order of catalytic activity among the four catalysts apart from CZ-600 is the same as that of their SExt value. This phenomenon makes a speculation that the SExt value 71.7 m2/g is large enough to make soot particle uniformly disperse over the surface of the CZ-based catalysts. Hence, the external surface area of CZ-based catalysts may be an important factor that makes impact on their catalytic activity. 3.5 Low-temperature reduction results The H2-TPR technique is used to analyze the reduction properties of catalysts and obtained profiles are displayed in Fig. 8 . With increasing aging temperature, in comparison with CZ-600, the onset temperature of aged catalysts constantly increases due to the continuous aggregation of particles and decline of textural properties [28]. Note that all the five catalysts show analogical profiles with a prominent peak at lower temperature (peak α) and a shoulder peak at higher temperature (peak β). With the increment of calcination temperature, peak α shows much smaller change (about 25 °C from 505 °C to 530 °C) than that of peak β (c.a 46 °C from 537 °C to 583 °C). To further compare the low-temperature reducibility, the H2 consumption below 500 °C of these five CZ-based catalysts (for the soot oxidation completes in low temperature below 500 °C) is also shown in Fig. 8. The results show that the low reducibility among these catalyst is in the order of CZ-600 > CZ-700 > CZ-800 > CZ-900 > CZ-1000 illustrating that the low-temperature reducibility of as-prepare CZ-based catalysts decreases with increasing treatment temperature owing to the sintering of catalyst, consistent with that of A610/A465 value from Vis Raman. The relatively smaller differences of low-temperature reducibility among CZ-600, CZ-700 and CZ-800 seem to have no impact on their catalytic activity for these three catalysts have identical catalytic activity. While under higher temperature treatment (900 and 1000 °C), the drastic decline of reducibility for CZ-900 and CZ-1000 maybe lead to the visibly inferior catalytic performance. But it remains to be discussed because other factors like external surface couldn’t be excluded. 4 Discussions In this work, two interesting phenomena are worthy to notice in above results: (1) The distinction of the VO-S content and O2-desorption ability among these five CZ-based catalysts makes no difference to their catalytic activity; (2) It is hard to distinguish the effect of external surface area and low-temperature reducibility on the catalytic activity. To further investigate these factors, 10 wt% MnO2 is loaded on CZ-600 and CZ-800 and the preparation procedure is displayed in experimental section. The soot conversion over MnO2 loaded catalysts is exhibited in Fig. S2 and relative Tx value is listed in Table S1. It can be seen that after 10 wt% MnO2 loaded, the catalytic activity of Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 are comparative and much better than that of CZ-600 and CZ-800, respectively. Furthermore, the T50 and T90 value of Mn loaded catalysts, compare with relative CZ-based catalysts, have decreased by 28 °C and 27 °C, respectively. The following discussion will focus on how these factors influence the catalytic activity of soot oxidation. 4.1 Effects of O2 desorption ability As mentioned in Section 3.5, no apparent correlation between the catalytic activity of soot oxidation and O2 desorption ability is found for five CZ-based catalysts. After 10 wt% MnO2 loaded on CZ-600 and CZ-800, three desorption peaks are noted as shown in Fig. S3, in which desorption of O2 below 500 °C is mainly attributed to peak α. The α peak temperature of Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 is almost identical and keep constant compared with CZ-600 and CZ-800, but the peak area below 500 °C of both MnO2 loaded catalysts, displayed in Fig. S3 (unloaded CZ-600 and CZ-800 as a contrast), is lower than that of unloaded catalysts. So the desorption ability of these four catalysts follows in the sequence: Mn/CZ-800 < Mn/CZ-600 < CZ-600 < CZ-800. However, on the contrary, Mn/CZ-800 shows a similar catalytic performance as Mn/CZ-600 but much better than pure CZ-based catalysts. This phenomenon further demonstrates that the O2 adsorption/desorption ability of these catalysts does not make obvious effect to their catalytic activity of soot oxidation or their capacity of O2 adsorption/desorption are high enough to promote the migration of active Ox − species even for CZ-1000 with the worst oxygen transfer capacity. 4.2 Effect of external surface and low-temperature reducibility Although many researchers have thoroughly investigated whether the surface area and reduction property of catalysts have impact on their catalytic activity of soot oxidation, there are still no explicit conclusions in these aspects [34–36]. Many of these conflicting reports concentrate on the BET surface area and the integral reducibility [35,37], but the small pores (including micropores) and bulk reduction under high temperature respectively have contributed large proportion to their surface area and integral reducibility, which doesn’t work for the contact efficiency and intrinsic catalytic activity. Recently, some researchers point out that the external surface area and reduction at lower temperature may be the indeed two aspects that have a direct effect to their activity [36,38]. As a consequence, in this study, it is of necessity to confirm whether and how external surface and low-temperature reducibility influence the catalytic activity of soot oxidation. From the results in Sections 3.6 and 3.7, the difference in external surface area between CZ-600 and CZ-800 (15.6 m2/g) is higher than that between CZ-900 and CZ-1000 (11.4 m2/g) while the disparity in low-temperature reducibility is almost the same, but CZ-600 and CZ-800 have identical catalytic activity while CZ-900 has a better catalytic performance than CZ-1000. Hence, in these five catalysts, it is not the low-temperature reducibility but the external surface area that mainly influences their activity. Besides, it is reasonable to speculate that the SExt value 75 m2/g is large enough to make the soot efficiently contact with catalysts so as to result in a similar activity from CZ-600 to CZ-800. After 10 wt% MnO2 loaded, the BET surface area, SExt value and total pore volume as well as pore volume above 25 nm of both Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 (as shown in Table S1) are apparently lower than that of CZ-600 and CZ-800, respectively. In addition, the loading of MnO2 contributes to significant decline of larger pores (pore diameter > 25 nm) and pore size distribution shifts to smaller pores for both Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 (seen from Fig. S4). Furthermore, Mn/CZ-600 shows a higher SExt value than Mn/CZ-800 though they have similar activity. So under this condition, it can be further concluded that the SExt value 58.2 m2/g is still sufficient enough to make a better dispersion of the soot particle. Herein, there might be a critical SExt value between 58.2 m2/g of Mn/CZ-800 and 49.5 m2/g of CZ-900 that is just enough to well disperse the soot particle. Higher than this critical value may not have positive impact on the contact efficiency between catalysts and soot particles, while lower than this value will decline the contact efficiency and thus their catalytic activity of CZ-based catalysts. The low-temperature reducibility of Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 are also characterized by H2-TPR and obtained profiles are displayed in Fig. S5, both of Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 exhibits two reduction peaks, which temperature are both much lower than that of CZ-600 and CZ-800 catalysts. Besides, Mn/CZ-600 and Mn/CZ-800 show a similar low-temperature reducibility which is much higher than that of pure CZ-600 and CZ-800 catalysts. The much better catalytic performance of these two MnO2-loaded catalysts illustrates that this enhancement of activity is mainly ascribed to their much higher low-temperature reducibility. Therefore, the low-temperature reducibility of CZ-based catalysts has a positive effect on their catalytic activity, but it makes no influence while the difference of this reducibility among catalysts is small. This is why the catalytic activity disparity among the Mn-loaded catalysts and unloaded catalysts is not as large as that of their low temperature reducibility and CZ-600 have a similar catalytic activity as CZ-800 though they have different low-temperature reducibility. 4.3 The tentative mechanism of the synergistic effect between external surface and low-temperature reducibility According to the results discussed in Section 4.2, under tight contact, the external surface area and low-temperature reducibility of CZ-based catalysts are two important factors that influence their catalytic activity, as displayed in Scheme 1 . On the one hand, for CZ-based catalysts, the contribution of external surface to surface area is much higher than that of larger pores. Thereof, the contact efficiency mainly depends on the external surface area. Slightly higher temperature treatment (700 and 800) can still maintain large enough external surface area of CZ-based catalysts to make a good dispersion of soot particles and thus the contact efficiency will be unaffected. While under much higher treating temperature, the external surface area will radically decline owing to the severe sintering of crystal size (seen from Table 3) so as to reduce the contact efficiency between catalysts and soot particles. So the critical SExt value between 58.2 m2/g and 49.5 m2/g will be the watershed of contact efficiency. On the other hand, the reduction of soot particles is much slower than by H2, so the relatively small difference in low-temperature reducibility of CZ-based catalysts would make almost no difference to the generation of the active Ox − species. Only when the distinct of low-temperature reducibility of these catalysts is large enough, the difference of Ox − species generation rate is apparent and different catalytic activity of soot particle can be observed. As a result, higher external surface area and low-temperature reducibility doesn’t mean a higher catalytic activity, but drastic decline in external surface area and low-temperature reducibility under high temperature treatment will simultaneously contribute to evidently worse catalytic performance of CZ-based catalysts. In a word, for CZ-based catalysts, the external surface area determines their contact efficiency with soot particles while the low-temperature reducibility of catalysts will indirectly ensure the generation rate of active Ox −. The synergistic effect of these two factors will play a big role on the catalytic activity of soot conversion for different CZ-based catalysts. 5 Conclusions In this investigation, via multiple characterization and detail comparison of seven CZ-based catalysts, several conclusions can be summarized and shown as follows: (1) There is no apparent relative between catalytic activity and the amount of VO-S as well as O2-desorption ability; (2) The contact between CZ-based catalysts and soot particles mainly occurs at external surface. The contact efficiency won’t increase along with increasing external surface area when above a critical value; (3) The low-temperature reducibility will have an important impact on the catalytic activity while the difference of the reducibility is obvious enough, because the small distinction of this reducibility in H2 may be weakened in soot particles. On the basis of above verdicts, it can be predicted that a good CZ-based catalysts applied to GPF should: (1) have large enough external surface area; (2) be equipped with apparently higher reducibility at low temperature. In this case, MnO2-loaded CZ-based catalysts will be a prospective choice when applied to soot oxidation in GPF.

        "dc:description": "Fresh CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 (CZYL) catalyst was synthesized via calcining at 600 ºC of relative precipitates obtained by co-precipitation and then aged at 700–1000 ºC. Afterwards, 10wt% MnO2 was further loaded on the fresh and 800 ºC-aging sample, respectively. The oxidation activity tests illustrate that the catalytic performance of CZYL catalysts firstly remains stable and then decreases with increasing aging temperature. Systematical investigations suggest that the amount of surface oxygen vacancies and O2 desorption ability of all these Ceria-Zirconia (CZ) based catalysts may be high enough to make little difference on their catalytic activity. On the contrary, it is found that the external surface area and low-temperature reducibility (<500 ºC) are the two major factors to influence the soot oxidation activity. Interestingly, the external surface area will does no difference when its value is above a critical point. Furthermore, only relatively larger distinction in low-temperature reducibility among catalysts will contribute to apparently various catalytic activity.",
