Co/NaY was found to be an excellent isomerization catalyst, in contrast to Co/A1203 on which the main route was observed to be cracking. This is attributed to the difference in cobalt reducibility over the two supports. The use of laC-labelled 2-methyl pentanes made the elucidation of the mechanism of isomerization on these samples possible. A cyclic mechanism (CM) operates only on metal particles, while for both metal particles and support, a bond shift mechanism (BS) is the main route for isomerisation. On Pt-Co/NaY samples, the contribution of the cyclic mechanism to isomerisation relative to isomerisation by bond shift route is significantly enhanced on the catalysts with cobalt loading higher than 22 at.%. The results are discussed in terms of small metal particles inserted into NaY supercage and the enhanced reduction of cobalt ions.

Introduction Alumina supported platinum, cobalt and platinum--cobalt catalysts have been investigated in various reactions, such as hydrocarbon conversion [1,2], CO hydrogenation [3-5] and low temperature methane coupling [6]. The platinum- cobalt system has also been studied using organometallic precursors [7-10] * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(96)00350-X 238 F Garin et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 237-247 which can give us a possibility of comparing: (i) heterogeneous catalysis with inorganic chemistry [11-14], (ii) heterogeneous catalysts prepared by incipient wetness and by using cluster compounds [14]. However, Pt-Co/NaY system has never been applied to study model reactions characteristic of reforming processes. The structure and stability of platinum particles on Pt/KL-zeolite have already been studied [15,16] and their reactivity has been reported in isobutane dehydrogenation [17] and for aromatization [18] has been reported. With the platinum-containing zeolite the production of aromatics is largely enhanced. Although aromatization is desirable to enhance the quality of unleaded fuels, skeletal isomerization would also be an important alternative which could be achieved by modification of Pt-zeolite system by addition of a second metal. Skeletal rearrangement of alkanes has been studied on alumina-supported platinum catalysts and two mechanisms have been suggested, cyclic and bond shift mechanisms (denoted by CM and BS, respectively); the former involving adsorbed methylcyclopentane (MCP) as intermediate transition state. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms are strongly influenced by the average metallic particle size and/or the degree of metal/support interaction. Since the mechanism of skeletal transformations of alkanes is well established, the work presented in the present article aims to clarify how the platinum sites modified by the platinum-cobalt interaction and the NaY support affect the mechanism of skeletal isomerization in a well known reaction. Pt/NaY catalysts modified by cobalt have already been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction [19-22]. In those studies it was established that reduction of cobalt ions is facilitated by platinum and that zero valent cobalt is included in the bimetallic phase formed. The major advantage for the NaY supported samples is the formation of small bimetallic particles inside the supercage, this having been indicated by chemisorption [21]. Some of the exchanged cobalt ions (Co2+) form clusters with platinum or platinum--cobalt particles, hence two effects can be anticipated: (i) the presence of stabilized platinum particles of size less than 2 nm, and (ii) the effect of the modification of platinum by cobalt in the Pt-Co/NaY. In the present study, both effects are taken into consideration and the catalyst structure is related to the isomerization being a structure sensitive reaction. 2. Experimental The Pt/NaY, Co/NaY, Pt-Co/NaY were prepared by ion-exchange of a sample of NaY zeolite (Strem Chemicals, Lot No. 031112104). To prepare ion-exchanged samples, the zeolite was first stirred with carefully deionized water (200 cm3 gzeolite-1) at 343 K for 1 h.

After 24 h ion exchange at the same temperature, the samples were filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water. For the preparation of Pt-Co/NaY bimetallic samples, Pt2+ was introduced first; after filtering, the Pt/NaY was then further exchanged with Co2+ solution. All materials were dried in air, first at room temperature and then at 383 K for 2 h. Calcination was carried out in a stream of pure oxygen (40 cm3 min-1) with a temperature ramp of 0.5 K min-1 from room temperature to 573 K, then holding the temperature at that value for 2 h. Reduction of samples was carried out in a stream of H2 (40 cm3 min-1) raising the temperature with a ramp of 10 K min-1 to 723 K, holding the sample at that temperature for 1 h and then cooling down to room temperature [19,20]. The samples were analysed by atomic absorption at Vernaison CNRS. Table 1 gives the nominal compositions of the catalysts, the true metal loadings and the atomic percentages of the components. The catalytic reaction was performed in a plug flow reactor working under isothermal and isobaric conditions [23]. A sample of 10 mg of catalyst, diluted with 25 mg of support, was used in each experiment. The system was operated under hydrogen flow and series of hydrocarbon injections are performed. The reaction products were analysed by using a Varian type gas chromatograph with a fused silica capillary column (CP sil 5CB). The samples were characterized by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and chemisorption [ 19], by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [22]. X-ray diffrac- tion and EXAFS measurements [24] were also used to show the presence of X-ray amorphous, mono- and bi-metaUic particles. Measurements using wide angle X- ray scattering (WACS) showed for examples in Pt/NaY, the presence of platinum particles of about 1.5 nm in diameter [24]. The single TPR peak of Pt-Co/NaY samples was also indicative of the formation of bimetallic particles less than 2.0 nm in diameter [19]. The presence of bimetallic particles was confirmed by a shift of the XPS binding energy of 0.5 eV towards higher values for the Co 2p [22]. 240 F Garin et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 237-247 3. Results and discussion The results for 2-methyl pentane rearrangements over the various catalysts are presented in Table 2. The activities of Pt/NaY and Pt-Co/NaY are more or less identical, while Co/NaY is about 10 times less active, regardless of the support. The activity of the pure NaY zeolite was negligible compared to the metal-containing zeolites. Surprisingly Co/NaY was the most selective catalyst for isomerization and the selectivity increased with increasing metal loading, whereas Co/A1203 yielded only cracked products. The selectivity for isomerization of NaY was about 60% while Pt/NaY and Pt-Co/NaY were the least selective catalysts for isomerization (22%). It must be noted that cobalt has some impurities of platinum (as shown in Table 1 the sample contains 1200 ppm cobalt and 60 ppm platinum) and this may influence the reduction of Co2+ ions but does not affect the structure of small cobalt particles. The product distributions characteristic of cracking and isomerization also provide useful information. In isomerization the main product was n-hexane (n-H) on the Pt/NaY sample, but 3-methyl pentane (3-MP) was the predominant product on the Pt-Co/NaY and Co/NaY samples and even on NaY alone. The molecules of 2,2- and 2,3-dimethyl pentanes (2,2- and 2,3-DMP) were also formed and their contribution increased when the cobalt loading was increased. Methyl- cyclolpentane (MCP) was formed in small amounts. The ratio 3-MP/n-H increased with cobalt loading. Extensive cracking occurred only on the Co/A1203 catalyst, while on the other samples 6C~ =3C2 =0, which means that C1 ---- C5 and Ce = Ca, The i-Ca/n-C4 ratios show that n-Ca, a secondary product, was formed in small amounts on all but the Co/A1203 catalyst. The i-Cs/n-C5 ratios corresponded to the statistical distributions, in the range of 1 to 2, except on Co/A1203 where the production of i-C5 is favored. The iso- to C2-mode ratio was defined by Anderson [25]: (i) the iso-mode involves rupture between two carbon atoms in which a tertiary and/or a quaternary carbon atom are present (~t,7-interaction); and (ii) the C2-mode involves C-C bond rupture between only primary and secondary carbon atoms (a,~-interaction). The high value of the ratio shown in Table 3 indicate that for the NaY-supported samples the iso-mode of cracking is favored. For 2-methylpentane a comparison of the measured cracking pattern with the statistical distribution is presented in Table 3. The statistical distribution of the products in carbon--carbon bond rupture gives a relative contribution of (CI+Cs)/ (C2+C4)/(2C3) equal to 3/1/1. The results for Co/A1203 are not included in the table because of the extensive cracking which occurred. Demethylation reactions were not favored on these catalysts, possibly due to the influence of the zeolite cages in which the small particles are located. Depropylation was more favored than deethylation, except on Co(5.6)/NaY, but these two reactions were increased F.

These results explain why the iso-mode is favored compared to the Ca-mode. Table 4 shows the results obtained for methyl cyclopentane. First, MCP reacts about ten times faster than does 2-MP when the reaction temperature was about the same (20 K difference in the temperature). In this case the intrinsic platinum behaviour is prevailed and consequently, the cyclic mechanism took place via a MCP adsorbed intermediate. On the catalysts, the 2-MP reaction and MCP ring opening reaction had similar rates over the Pt/NaY, Pt-Co/NaY and Co/NaY catalysts. For the C5 ring-opening reaction, Pt/NaY was 1.5 times more active than Ptl0Col.5/NaY and 2 times more active than Ptl0Co2.5/NaY while Co/A1203 is 10 times less active than Pt--Co/NaY samples and Co/NaY is nearly inactive in this reaction. The selectivity for ring-opening did not reach 100% on any NaY supported catalysts, while the ring opening selectivity on Co/A1203 was equal to 0.2%. The value of the selectivity ratio, r =3-MP/n-H, approached 0.6~:0.1 on all the NaY supported catalysts. This corresponds to the ring opening in a statistical way (r =0.5) if the MCP reacted via a mechanism involving cyclic intermediate. This point is, however, questionable as the rate of the MCP ring opening reaction does not exceed that of 2-MP reaction. This will be discussed further together with the results obtained using 13C-labelled hydrocarbons.

Results with l~C-labelled hydrocarbons In order to obtain deeper insight into the mechanism of the reactions, 13C- labelled hydrocarbons were applied. Table 5 shows the results of experiments on the isomerization of 13C-labelled 2-methylpentanes was carried out at 570 K. On all the four catalysts supported on the NaY zeolite, isomerization also proceeded via a cyclic mechanism even on the acidic support. Acidity results from the protons formed in the ion exchange position during hydrogenation of the metal cations. On Pt/NaY, the isomeric products formed via the cyclic mechanism represent 86% of the isomers. When cobalt was added the relative contribution of the cyclic mechanism diminished to 66-62%. With pure Co/NaY zeolite 37% of the isomers were formed via the cyclic mechanism. The distribution of the various isotopic species formed at 573 K from 2MP-213C and 2MP-413C are presented in Table 6, in which the main features are as follows: (i) the cracking selectivity; (ii) the relative contributions of the isomers formed via the cyclic or bond shift mechanism; (iii) the contributions of the two bond shift mechanisms BS(A) and BS(B); and (iv) the percentage of methylcyclopentane among the isomeric products formed via the cyclic mechanism. As far as BS reactions are concerned, we have already shown for 2-MP that the bond shift on metallic particles occurs via two carbon-carbon bond rearrangement mechanisms: BS(A) and BS(B), depending on whether the migrating group is methyl- or propyl-group, respectively, [26].

The results of Table 6 show that contribution of isomerization via the cyclic mechanism amounts to about 20% over Pt/NaY and Pt-Co/NaY catalysts. The presence of the C5 cyclization reaction on such catalysts in such high proportion is unexpected. On the other hand, isomerization via cyclic mechanism is only 3% over the Co/NaY sample. In order to confirm the presence of the cyclic mechanism even on these zeolite- supported catalysts the values of the 3-MP/n-H ratio obtained from the MCP hydrogenolysis (a) and from the cyclic mechanism (b) are compared in Table 7. If cyclic mechanism proceeds via an intermediate species identical to MCP, the ratios of 3-MP/n-H obtained by (a) and (b) should be the same. Good agreement between (a) and (b) indicates that the cyclic mechanism proceeds via MCP intermediate. Regarding the values resulting from BS(A) mechanism, the migration of methyl groups to give 3-MP is highly preferable compared to the chain lengthening. Identical results have already been obtained on platinum catalysts [27]. The relative contributions of the BS(A) and BS(B) mechanisms is correlated with a structural effect in chain-lengthening reaction. On the alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the contribution of BS(B) to chain lengthening decreases regularly in sequence: 2-methyl butane >2-methylpentane >2-methylhexane, and the values of the ratio A/B were 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1, respectively [28]. On Pt-Co/NaY and on Co/NaY the percentages of BS(A) is 9%:k3% and 26%+1%, respectively. These values are lower than those obtained on Pt/A1203 catalysts, indicating that there is an effect of small metal particles encapsulated in NaY. One may explain the predominance of BS(B) over BS(A) if a 1,2-alkyl shift in an adsorbed cr-alkyl species is assumed: when the migrating group is an alkyl rather than a methyl group, the BS(B) route will be favored. In order to understand the above results we must consider the following facts. Comparing the properties of NaY and inorganic oxides, on Pt/A1203 the rate of hydrogenolysis for MCP is 10 times faster than that for 2-MP, whereas, on Pt/NaY these two rates are comparable in magnitude. Furthermore, the rates measured for E Garin et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 237-247 245 both MCP and 2-MP are higher on Pt/NaY than on Pt/AI203. These results point out the effect of the support in the catalytic reaction. As far as Co/A1203 is concemed the main reaction is cracking, in contrast to Co/ NaY, a high selectivity for the isomerization reaction is observed. Moreover, it is surprising that the isomerization proceeds on Co/NaY not only by a bond shift mechanism but also via the cyclic mechanism. This result may be attributed mainly to the difference in the reducibility of cobalt on the two supports: on alumina, the extent of reduction is higher [29,30], than on NaY; in the latter case, most of the cobalt is located in the hexagonal or sodalite cages in which reduction takes place only to a small extent even at elevated temperatures [22]. On platinum-cobalt bimetallic catalysts, deethylation and depropylafion are favored as indicated by the deviation of their selectivity values from those given by the statistical distributions. The percentage of cyclic mechanism occurring decreases from Pt/NaY to Pt-Co/NaY. Since we have proven that bimetallic particles are formed [21,22], the question arises as to whether this is a consequence of an increase in the particle size of platinum, or of the blockage of the single Pt surface sites by cobalt which are responsible for cyclic mechanism. Independent evidences have indicated that small X-ray amorphous bimetallic particles stable after reduction in the zeolite cages, thus we incline to ascribe this effect to the surface modification by cobalt [21]. From the catalytic results, conclusions can be drawn concerning the participa- tion of metallic aggregates and the support in controlling the selectivity. First, on alumina supported platinum-cobalt particles, a very high selectivity is found for the isomerization of 2-MP, yielding exclusively 3-MP, with n-hexane produced in very small quantities. The same results were obtained using MCP as reactant [1]. On the other hand, NaY supported platinum-cobalt particles yield 3-MP and n-H in the same amounts regardless of the reactant. Finally, the ratio of iso- to C2-mode was in favor of the C2-mode on alumina supported catalysts [2] opposite to what we observed on NaY-supported bimetallic catalysts. These observations point out that the carbon-carbon bond between tertiary and secondary carbon atom is involved in the catalytic reaction on zeolite catalysts, and this support the presence of carbenium ions. Second, a cyclic mechanism may occur only on metal particles, while bond-shift may take place on both metal particles and the support. When Pt- Co/NaY is used, the relative contributions of the cyclic mechanism to bond shift mechanism and cracking is nearly constant, however, the bond shift contribution increases by a factor between 2 to 10 when the cobalt loading is in the range between 22 to 100 at%. 4. Conclusions As a consequence of particle size, isomerization is predominant on Co/NaY sample, whereas the cracking is the main reaction on C0/A1203; 246 F. Garin et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 237-247 on Pt-Co/A1203 particles, 3-MP is exclusively formed by isomerization of 2- MP and MCP as reactants [ 1 ], while Pt-Co/NaY catalysts yield 3-MP and n-H are formed in the same amounts indicating the predominance of cyclic mechanism on NaY-supported metals; the iso- to C2-ratio is low on alumina supported catalysts while on Pt-Co/NaY this ratio is higher which is probably due to the participation of the bonds between tertiary and secondary carbon atoms; the proportion of the cyclic mechanism to the bond shift mechanism and to cracking is nearly constant on Pt-Co/NaY, but the bond shift mechanism is significantly enhanced on the catalysts with cobalt loadings higher than 22 at.%. the exceptional behaviour of cobalt containing samples may be due to the presence of small cobalt particles surrounded by Co2+ ions.

The catalytic transformations of 2-methylpentane (2MP), and methylcyclopentane (MCP), over Co NaY , PtCo NaY , PtCo Al2O3 and NaY samples have been investigated. Co NaY was found to be an excellent isomerization catalyst, in contrast to Co Al2O3 on which the main route was observed to be cracking. This is attributed to the difference in cobalt reducibility over the two supports. The use of 13C-labelled 2-methyl pentanes made the elucidation of the mechanism of isomerization on these samples possible. A cyclic mechanism (CM) operates only on metal particles, while for both metal particles and support, a bond shift mechanism (BS) is the main route for isomerisation. On PtCo NaY samples, the contribution of the cyclic mechanism to isomerisation relative to isomerisation by bond shift route is significantly enhanced on the catalysts with cobalt loading higher than 22 at.%. The results are discussed in terms of small metal particles inserted into NaY supercage and the enhanced reduction of cobalt ions.
