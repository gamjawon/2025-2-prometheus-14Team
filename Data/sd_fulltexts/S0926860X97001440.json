Y-zeolite, mordenite and L-zeolite were investigated, as well as sulfated zirconia catalysts. Zeolites were used in protonic form or after ion exchange with lanthanum nitrate. Studies were carried out in liquid phase in a fixed-bed reactor. It was found that Y-zeolite exchanged with lanthanum, being the catalyst with the best stability, is the catalyst that forms higher quantities of carbonaceous deposits. The amount of coke on this catalyst can be as high as 13-14%. This coke requires temperatures higher than 500\"C to be completely eliminated. Temperature-programmed analyses indicated that the amount of coke eliminated from the catalyst during partial regeneration, strongly depends on the heating rate. This is due to a competition between coke gasification and its modification in structure leading to an aromatic type of coke, which then requires higher temperatures to be burnt. Pore and surface area measurements carried out on deactivated catalysts suggest that a pore plugging mechanism takes place during the reaction. Catalysts with too strong acidity (e.g. protonic form of Y-zeolite or sulfated zirconia) have no activity for trimethylpentane production at 80, most probably due to a very fast deactivation, even though the amount of coke is notably lower than in the lanthanum-exchanged zeolites. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Alkylate gasoline is a valuable fraction to be added to the gasoline pool, since it has both a high motor and research octane number [1] and low volatility. Iso- butane alkylation with C4 olefins is industrially car- ried out in liquid phase using HF or HzSO4 acids as catalysts. Due to environmental and potential hazards, this process has received increasing attention in order *Corresponding author.

PII S0926-860X(97)00 1 44-0 to substitute these liquids by solid acid catalysts. Zeolite catalysts [2-5], sulfated zirconia superacid [6,7] and heteropoliacids [8,9] have been recently used for this reaction. Y-zeolites are the solids that have been studied with more detail [2,5,10-17]. Also beta [4,7,11,17,18], mordenite [3], EMT [14,16], and MCM-22 [3,4], have been used, as well as medium pores zeolites, such as ZSM-5 [19,20] and ZSM-11 [21]. However, these two catalysts were not active for trimethylpentanes production at tow temperatures due to spatial constraints inside the catalyst pores. Many companies have also tried to develop a catalyst and a 200 C.A. Querini, E. Roa/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 199-215 process for isobutane alkylation using solid acid cata- lysts. Zeolites such as Beta [22] and NH~--CeY [23], amberlyst-type resins [24], BF3 promoted materials like MCM-22 [25] and large pore zeolites [26], ZSM- 20 [27], acid-cation exchange resin-BF3 [28], and more recently silica+CF3SO3H [29], alumina+BF3 [30] and silica+SbF5 [31] were proposed. Most of the catalysts mentioned above showed good activity for isobutane alkylation. However, the fast deactivation is a major drawback for all of them. Typically, catalyst deactivation occurs after a short time on oil, in the range of minutes (e.g. 2-4) or in some cases up to a few hours [5,22]. This longer stability was obtained by changing reaction condi- tions, such as using a very high isobutane/olefins ratio [5]. Catalyst stability depends upon the type of reactor, the continuous stirred tank reactor being more suitable than the fixed-bed reactor. This is because in the former case, the olefins concentration during reaction keeps at a minimum, thus improving the catalyst life [17]. In the examples reported in Ref. [24], a semi- continous process proved to be better than a continous process, whereas olefins injection at various points in the reactor is preferred in Ref. [32]. However, inde- pendently of the reactor and process design, the maximum catalyst life is such that frequent catalyst regeneration is unavoidable. Large pore catalysts, with three-dimensional pore structure, were the most stable for isobutane alkylation, apparently due to a higher diffusivity of alkylated compounds in these materials. The deactivation rate also depends on the total con- centration as well as on the strength distribution of the Brrnsted acid sites due to their influence on the hydrogen transfer activity as has been found on Y-zeolite [2]. Even though coke deposition during this reaction is the cause for not being applicable in an industrial scale, characterization of carbonaceous deposits and regenerability of these materials has been scarcely reported. Recently, Flego et al. [10,11] presented a spectroscopic characterization of such carbonaceous deposits but unfortunately, no activity data were reported in this study. Weitkamp and Maixner [33] studied coke deposited on LaY-zeolite catalyst by CP/ MAS 13C NMR. Regeneration studies were reported for H-EMT zeolite catalysts [16]. In this case, a unique temperature of 600 was used to bum off coke. The regeneration procedure proposed in [23] for a zeolite consists of two steps. In the first one, stripping with helium, an inert compound such as NH3, SO2, CO2 or amines at temperatures higher than the reaction tem- perature is carried out. In the second step, an oxygen containing gas is used to burn the coke at temperatures up to 600. In the case of a BF3 promoted resin, the catalyst is regenerated by extraction with a polar solvent such as C1-C5 alcohols [24]. However, in this case, the BF3 is added to the resin before and/or during the reaction. At present, there are few reports to our knowledge about the amount of coke on alkylation catalysts, temperatures needed to burn off coke, influence of acidity on coke amount, its role on coke gasification, etc. Weitkamp and Maixner measured the amount of coke deposited on LaY-zeolite at 80 and higher temperatures [33]. The objective of this paper is to characterize the coke deposits on solid acid catalysts formed during isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins. The catalysts used in this study include: Y-zeolite, Mordenite, L- zeolite, and sulfated zirconia. Carbonaceous deposits were characterized by temperature-programmed tech- niques and solvent extraction. In situ regeneration experiments were also carried out with the more stable catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts H-Mordenite (H-MOR): provided by PQ Corpora- tion (CBV30A), Si/AI=15, obtained by calcina- tion of ammonium form, at 530 for 4h. Crystallinity degree: 97%. H-Y Zeolite (H-Y): provided by UOP in the sodium form (Y-54) Si/AI=5.3, obtained from a sodium form (Crystallinity degree: 100%), by ion exchange with 1N NO3NH4 solution, in 4 steps, working at reflux conditions, drying at 100GC in between each ion exchange. The exchange level was 98%, and the final sodium content was 0.1%. Crystallinity degree: 85%. Finally the catalyst was calcined at 530, for 3 h. H-L Zeolite (H-L): provided by Union Carbide (SK-45). The exchange was carried out following the same procedure as with H-Y zeolite. Exchange C.A. Querini, E. Roa/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 199-215 201 level was 82%. As known, total exchange with L-zeolite is not achievable [34]. Crystallinity degree: 90%. La-H-Y zeolites: Na-Y zeolite was exchanged with La(NO3)3, 0.58 M, following three different procedures: (1) exchange with La(NO3)3 in reflux, for 4h, drying at 100, calcining at 550 for 4 h, and then a second ion exchange step, using the same conditions as in the first one. The exchange level was 91%. This sample is labeled LCL-Y. Crystallinity degree: 93%. (2) exchange with La(NO3)3 in reflux, for 4 h, drying at 100, calcining at 550, and then a second ionic exchange step, using NH4NO3, for 4 h at reflux, drying and then calcining at 550. Exchange level: first exchange: 68%, second exchange: 21%. In the second exchange, lanthanum was not detected in the final solution. This sample is labeled LCH-Y. Crystallinity degree: 97%. (3) exchange with NH4NO3, 4 h at reflux, drying and calcining at 550, and then a second exchange with La(NO3)3, using the same con- ditions. Level of exchange: 68% in the first step, and 18% in the second. This sample is named HCL-Y. Crystallinity degree: 90%. Similar procedures were used to obtain mordenite exchanged with lanthanum and ammonium (sam- ples LCL-MOR, LCH-MOR), and L-zeolite (sam- ples LCL-L). For the latter, the exchange level achieved was 30%. The crystallinity degree was 89% and 90% for the LCL-MOR and LCH-MOR, respectively, and 99% for the LCL-L catalyst. Sulfated zirconia (SZ) was also used under the same reaction conditions as the zeolites. This catalyst was prepared by impregnation of the zirconium hydroxide as described elsewhere [35], and activated at 600 before reaction. 2.2. Catalyst characterization 2.2.1. Ammonia TPD Acidity was characterized by NH3 TPD. Experi- ments were carried out using 200 mg of zeolite sam- ple, which were placed in a quartz reactor, and heated under nitrogen flow (50 cm3/min) up to 400. After 2 h at these conditions, the reactor was cooled to the adsorption temperature, typically below 100. The sample was saturated by flowing pure NH3 for 30 min. Then, the temperature was increased up to 200, maintaining this temperature until no NH3 desorption can be detected with the TCD detector. Finally, the NH3 is desorbed by heating at 10/min. The experi- ments were carried out with fresh and with partially regenerated catalysts. 2.2.2. Surface area and pore volume BET Surface area was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and pore volumes were esti- mated by means of t-plots. These determinations were carried out both on fresh and deactivated catalysts, using a Micrometrics Accusorb 2100 sorptometer. In these samples, different heating rates and final temperatures were used to pretreat the catalysts. 2.2.3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses XRD analyses were performed with a Shimadzu XD-D 1 instrument with a monochromator and CuKc~ radiation with a scanning rate of 0.5per minute. XRD analyses were carried out on fresh and regenerated catalysts. To obtain the crystallinity degree, the fresh zeolite Y-54, NHa-MOR and KL zeolites were taken as reference for each group of catalysts, and assigned a 100% crystallinity. 2.3. Activio, test The alkylation reaction of isobutane with a mixture of C4 linear olefins was carried out in liquid phase at temperatures between 25 and 80, and at 30 kg/ cm2, in a fixed-bed reactor. Prior to reaction the catalyst was pretreated heating in air from room temperature up to 250 at 2~'C/min. After 2 h at this temperature, the reactor was cooled to reaction tem- perature and purged with helium for 30 min. After this, the liquid mixture was stabilized at the desired flow rate by-passing the reactor. Finally the isobutane- olefins mixture was sent to the reactor. The space velocity was WHSV=I h i referred to the olefins. The IC4 is premixed with the olefins, and stored in a stainless steel vessel. The molar ratio used in this study was 15. The C4 olefins fraction contains 38% l- butene, 22% trans-2-butene, 14% cis-2-butene and 26% isobutene. In order to analyze the products coming out of the reactor, a ten-loop valve was used 202 C.A. Querini, E. Roa/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 199-215 to collect the sample to be analyzed after the run. Products were analyzed by GC, using a 100 m squa- lene capillary column. After the reaction, the reactor pressure was lowered to 1 atm in 5 min, and purged with helium at reaction temperature for 1 h. 2.4. Catalyst regeneration After the reaction, catalyst regeneration was carried out with selected samples, using air to burn off coke, heating up to 450 and 500. Helium was also used to strip the coke off to recover activity, heating up to 200 and 300, and maintaining the final tempera- ture for 2 h. 2.5. Coke characterization elsewhere [36]. Calibration of the system was carried out with pulses of 1.26% CO2/He. 2.5.2. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) These experiments were carried out in the same unit as the TPO analyses, but using helium as carrier gas, heating at 12/min. The total amount of hydrocar- bons released was either continously monitored with an FID detector, or collected in a multiloop valve and analyzed with a GC-column. 2.5.3. Coke extraction Coke was extracted using C12CH2 at room tempera- ture and using a mixture of benzene and methanol (4:1) in a Soxhlet equipment for 8 h. After this treatment, catalysts were analyzed by TPO. 2.5.1. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) TPO was carried out using a modified technique. CO2 produced during coke burning is converted to CH4, in a methanator. A H2 stream is fed to this reactor, in order to quantitatively convert CO2 into CH4. This compound is then continously monitored by an FID detector. Typically, 10 mg of coked catalyst were placed in a quartz cell, and heated at 12/min, using 6% O2/N2 as carrier gas flowing at 40 cm3/min. Additional details of the technique can be found 3.

Initially, TMP and DMH are obtained without any formation of product by oligomerization of the olefins (DMH=). This indicates that the hydro- gen transfer reaction is fast enough to avoid this undesirable product. After some time on oil, these compounds appear in the products and simultaneously the fraction of TMP decays to very low values. This time is 30 min approximately for LCL-Y and LCH-Y zeolites, while LCH-MOR and LCL-MOR are active for 15 and 10 min, respectively. Even though LCL-Y and LCH-Y catalysts display similar stability, LCL-Y catalyst reach higher values of selectivity toward TMP. With this catalysts up to 80% TMP are obtained in the C5fraction, while no more than 50% are obtained with the LCH-Y catalysts. This type of curves agree with those obtained with sulfated zirconia catalyst at 50 [37], MCM-22 [3], and on Y-zeolites [13]. Hydrogen transfer activity is an essential step for the alkylation reaction. Catalysts may lose capacity for hydrogen transfer and still be active for olefins oligomerization, forming DMH=, but not TMP. Before reaching this point, the fraction of TMP increases as a function of time. This occurs because the amount of C5 and C6 hydrocarbons decreases as a function of time. For example, with the LCH-Y catalyst, the distribution of C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 hydrocarbons at 3 min is 48%, 22%, 8%, 21% and 1%, respectively, and at 20 min it is 17%, 12%, 11%, 57% and 3%, respectively. The C5 and C6 compounds are formed by -scission plus hydrogen transfer of heavier hydrocarbons, such as C12, already formed by successive alkylation reactions [1]. At 30, the LCH-Y catalyst showed a low activity for TMP pro- duction, being active for 10 min approximately but with a selectivity lower than 20%. DMH~- were the main products. The highest liquid yield is obtained with the LCH-Y catalyst, and in all cases it follows a similar depen- dence on time: an initial increase followed by a continuous decrease. This same behavior has pre- viously been reported [4,12,21]. The initial increase is due to the decrease in cracking activity. Then, due to the further catalyst deactivation a decrease in the alkylation activity is observed. Combining stability, C5+ liquid yield, and the selectivity results, the LCH-Y catalyst is the best among the catalysts used in this study. These results indicate that a delicate tuning of the zeolite acidity by modifying the exchange level of La+3 and H+, allows an optimization of the catalyst performance, regarding stability and TMP production. In addition to those catalysts shown in Fig. 1, the following catalysts were tested at 80: H-MOR, LCL-L, H-L,SO4-ZrO2. H-Y zeolite was evaluated at 50. The protonic form of the zeolites (H-Y, H-MOR and H-L) was not active for TMP formation. Only DMH= were obtained with these catalysts. The same result was obtained with the H-Y zeolite run at 50'~C. Superacid catalysts did not show any activity at 80, neither TMP nor DMH= were obtained. It is probable that due to a very fast deactivation at this temperature, products formed with these catalysts were not observed even after 1 min on oil. Results reported in [7] show that at 50 the sulfated zirconia catalyst deactivates in 5 min approximately. When increasing the reaction temperature, more alkenyl carbenium ions with greater unsaturation are formed [10] and therefore a faster deactivation could be expected. In this study, a mixture of C4 olefins was used. However, this should not affect the catalysts perfor- mance significantly since when using a pure olefin it rapidly converts into a mixture of C4 olefins when getting in contact with the acid catalyst [1,38]. 3.2. Acidity Fig. 2A shows NH3 TPD results for Y, L and MOR fresh samples. Total NH3 desorption from MOR sam- ples is lower than for Y-zeolites. Mordenite displays two peaks. The second peak corresponds to NH3 desorbing at higher temperatures than those required to desorb NH3 from Y-zeolite in its LCL and LCH forms. However, H-Y zeolite displays a similar pattern as those found on mordenite, with a second desorption peak at high temperature. This could be the reason why at the temperature used in this study, no TMP formation could be observed on the H-Y zeolite. The stronger acid sites that correspond to the high tem- perature NH3 desorption peak could be responsible for a very strong adsorption of the olefins at the reaction temperature. Since the strong acid sites are needed during the alkylation reaction in order to catalyze the hydrogen transfer reaction, this strong adsorption 204 C.A. Querini, E.

Only the weak acid sites remain active, and consequently only oligomerization products are observed. Fig. 2B shows the TPD analyses of the fresh and regenerated LCH-Y catalysts. The regenerated sample was obtained by treating in air a deactivated catalyst, heating from room temperature up to 500, and maintaining this temperature for 30 min. The amount of coke remaining on this sample was 0.25%, as will be shown later. The amount of NH3 that desorbed from this catalyst was lower than for the fresh catalyst, indicating that even the small amount of coke left on the catalyst after the treatment at 500, is enough to significantly modify the acidity of the catalyst. 3.3. Coke characterization Fig. 3 shows TPO spectra of catalysts coked at 80. There is a common pattern in these spectra: a first peak that corresponds to coke burning below 300, and a high temperature peak, between 300 and 600, approximately.

On lanthanum-exchanged Y-zeolites, large amounts of carbonaceous deposits are formed, being almost double than on mordenite catalysts. However, LCL-Y and LCH-Y catalysts dis- play activity for longer times than mordenite catalysts. The amount of coke measured on La-Y zeolite at 80 by Weitkamp et al. [33] was 12.7%, which is quite similar to our results. Data from Fig. 1 and Table 1 indicate that catalysts that have a better stability are those that deposit more coke during the alkylation reaction. This fact could be related to both the acidity and pore structure of the catalysts. It was not possible to observe TMP formation on H-Y catalyst at 50, even though the coke content is lower than on LCL-Y and LCH-Y catalysts. Similarly on LCH-Y catalyst, at 30cC only DMH= were obtained. However, the amount of coke deposited at this temperature is less than half that deposited at 50 or 80. The TPO profile for this catalyst is also shown in Fig. 3. The second peak is much smaller than that obtained on the catalyst coked at 80. This TPO profile is similar to that obtained on the LCH-MOR catalyst at 80. Acidity obtained by exchanging Y-zeolite with lantha- nun is more effective for isobutane alkylation than when pure protonic form of the zeolite is used. According to the NH3 TPD results, this could be due to the higher acidity of the protonic form of the H-Y zeolite that leads to a fast deactivation as a consequence of a strong adsorption of the olefins and subsequent oligomerization. A similar situation is found when using the superacid sulfated zirconia catalyst. This catalyst deactivates so fast at 80, that when taking the first sample for GC analyses, no TMP are observed. LCH-Y zeolite, with a lower amount of La3+ and higher of H+ than the LCL-Y catalyst, seems to have better stability, and correspondingly a higher amount of coke is deposited during the reaction. These results suggest that depending upon the acidity and pore structure, an adequate balance of acidity is needed in order to prevent site blocking and pore mouth plugging. If acidity is too high, fast oligomeriza- tion-polymerization reactions take place, and cata- lysts deactivate very fast. If acidity is too low, the hydrogen transfer reaction does not take place, and no TMP are obtained. The catalyst should have enough acidity for the hydrogen transfer reaction and for the cracking reaction, in order to avoid the formation of long hydrocarbons. But this acidity should not be very high, since fast deactivation occurs in this case. The amount and the deposition rate of carbonaceous deposits formed on acid catalysts depend on the balance of (oligomerization-cracking-adsorption- aromatization) activities. The typical temperatures used for this reaction are rather low to favor aroma- tization of carbonaceous deposits, therefore long chain paraffinic and olefinic compounds prevail in such deposits, as shown by Flego et al. [ 10,11 ] and Stocker et al. [14]. Nevertheless, temperature has a strong influence on catalyst stability. At 30, the LCH-Y catalyst deactivates so fast that DMH= are the main products after very short times on oil. As will be discussed later, this type of TPO profile with a very small second peak relative to the first one, could indicate a pore mouth plugging mechanism. The presence of these oligomers with paraffinic structure in the zeolite pores also has influence on the hydrogen transfer activity. As discussed by Cardona et al. [5], these compounds are very effective for hydrogen transfer, since they are located in the zeolite supercages and therefore, very close to the carbenium ions alkylation intermediates. However, 206 C.A. Querini, E. Roa/Applied Catalysis A.\" General 163 (1997) 199-215 when coke is deposited in the zeolite pores, the diffusion of reactant and products is highly inhibited and therefore, the influence of the oligomers on the hydrogen transfer activity could be expected to be less important than that of isobutane. Fig. 4 shows results of partial burning and stripping experiments on the LCL-Y zeolite. In these experi- ments, different heating rates and final temperatures were used in the first step. In this first step, catalysts were treated either in vacuum, and helium or O2/N2 streams. Fig. 4A shows results obtained by heating up to 200 in vacuum or helium, Fig. 4B up to 350 in helium and Fig. 4C up to different final temperatures, but using 6% O2/N2 and helium as carrier gas. Sam- ples pretreated under vacuum at a high heating rate were kept at the final temperature overnight and when the heating rate was 10/min, the final temperature was held for 2 h. Using the high heating rate, the second peak of the TPO spectrum increases if com- pared to the original spectrum, obtained at 12/min. This result was obtained by heating up to 200 or 350. On the other hand, when the catalyst was heated at 10/min, and even though the final tem- perature was held only for 2 h, the catalyst retained a lower amount of coke than when using a very high heating rate and holding the final temperature over- night. Using helium as the carrier gas, and heating up to 740, it was not possible to eliminate all the coke from the catalyst (Fig. 4C). In this case, the TPO shows that the coke left on the LCL-Y catalyst after this high temperature treatment burns between 400 and 650, approximately. The catalyst when unloaded from the alkylation reactor is yellowish. After the catalyst is treated above 200, it changes its color to gray. Results shown in Fig. 4 agree with those reported in the literature [10,11]. Using spectro- scopic techniques, these authors found that carbon- aceous deposits change from aliphatic to aromatic structure upon heating. On the H-EMT zeolite, the coke deposited during the reaction was found to be non-aromatic [14]. TPO results are indicating that the heating rate is an important variable in coke gasifi- cation from catalysts used in alkylation reactions. This is because the acidity of the catalysts interacts with the carbonaceous deposits and influences their gasifica- tion in two opposite directions. First, acidity catalyses the cracking of the high molecular weight compounds, and this facilitates catalyst regeneration.

In all cases, the TPO of the coked catalyst is included for reference. acidity also promotes the aromatization of the coke deposits as temperature increases. These two reactions have different rates and activation energies. Therefore, when using high heating rates aromatization occurs at a higher rate than the cracking-desorption process and C.A.

Diffusion of cracked products out of the pore channels should also be taken into account. When the heating rate is too high, gasified products have not enough time to diffuse out of the pores; therefore, they re- adsorb as temperature increases and are transformed into coke. This means that the second peak of the TPO spectrum does not correspond to the original coke left on the catalyst during the reaction but is generated during the heating of the sample. Table 2 shows results of specific surface and pore volume measured in the fresh and coked LCL-Y catalyst, pretreated at 200 and 350 under vacuum. The TPO spectra of these catalysts are reported in Fig. 4. Samples that were evacuated by heating at 10/min, displayed half of the initial surface area and pore volume approximately, and there is little difference in these values when heating up to 200 or 350. But when a high heating rate is used, if the final temperature is 200, the pore volume of the coked catalyst and the surface area are negligible. This means that a pore blockage of the catalyst occurs during the reaction of isobutane with C4 olefins. If the final temperature is 350, coke removal is enough to unplug pore mouths and therefore the specific surface is similar to that obtained by heating at low rates. Taking the density of 224TMP (0.8 cm3/g) as repre- sentative of the density of carbonaceous deposits formed during the reaction, the volume occupied by 8.11% C corresponds to 0.1 cm3/g. Since the pore volume measured in this sample was 0.00 cm3/g, it is reasonable to assume that 0.21 cm3/g of pore volume of the fresh catalyst is not accessible due to a pore mouth blockage. Since the density used in this calcu- lation corresponds to an aliphatic hydrocarbon, and because after thermal treatment at 200 the structure is a more aromatic one with a higher density, the volume occupied by the coke calculated above repre- sents a conservative calculation, i.e. it could be even smaller. Similar analyses were carried out with the morde- nite catalyst. Table 3 shows the specific surface area of fresh and deactivated catalysts, after pretreatments at different temperatures. Fig. 5 shows the TPO analyses of the coke left after the reaction and after the treat- ments in vacuum up to 200 and 350 heating at 10 and 40/rain. Due to the presence of stronger acid sites on the mordenite compared to the Y catalyst, it is possible to eliminate by cracking the coke that is plugging the pores. At the two temperatures used in the pretreatment in these experiments, it was possible to measure a significant surface area and pore volume. A shift to higher temperature and an increase in the second peak of the TPO are also observed when heating at 40/rain up to 200. It is possible that most of the coke deposited on the mordenite catalyst is located on the outer surface of the crystals. This can be proposed on the basis of the TPO profile obtained on this catalyst compared to the Y-zeolite TPO analyses. While on the latter two well-defined peaks are obtained, in the former the first peak is the main one. If the second peak is generated during the increase in temperature due to an aromatization of 208 C.A. Querini, E.

As men- tioned earlier, the LCH-Y catalyst coked at 30 shows a TPO profile similar to that of mordenite. At this low temperature, it is likely that the fast coke deposition leads to a quick pore mouth plugging. Therefore, a small amount of coke is formed inside the pores and the second peak of the TPO decreases relatively to the first one. C.A. Querini, E.

TPO analyses of the LCL-Y catalyst coked at 50, and after solvent extraction experiments, using CI2CH2 and a mixture of (benzene+methanol) (B+M). It has been suggested that coke could be eliminated from alkylation catalysts using the solvent extraction procedure [1]. Fig. 6 shows TPO analyses of LCL-Y catalysts treated with C12CH2 and the benzene-metha- nol mixture. The catalyst was coked at 50. After the reaction, the coke content was 9.51%. Only a small amount of coke was removed by using either C12CH2 or benzene-methanol. After extraction with C12CH2 at room temperature coke was 9.23%, and using ben- zene-methanol in a Soxhlet apparatus, coke was reduced to 8.5%. TPO shows that this small decrease in the amount of coke corresponds to a decrease in the first peak of the TPO. It is possible that this corre- sponds to coke located on the outer surface of the catalyst, and because of this, the solvent extraction is more effective in its elimination. In any case, these experiments show that the carbonaceous deposit left on zeolite catalysts during the isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins is a heavy oligomer, that cannot be dissolved in solvents such as those used in this study. Fig. 7 shows the hydrocarbon distribution during the helium stripping of the LCL-Y catalyst. In this experiment, the coked catalyst was heated at 12/min in a helium stream. Samples of gases coming out of the reactor were collected in a multiloop valve, and then analyzed by GC. At low temperatures, light com- pounds in the fraction C 1-C4 are the main products. As temperature increases, C9+ fraction becomes dominant, while C5, C6, C7 and C8 go through a maximum. Isoparaffins are the main compounds in the C6 and C7 fraction. Fig. 8 shows results of helium stripping experi- ments. Catalysts were heated at 12/min up to 740 in a helium stream (TPHe). The FID signal is proportional to the total amount of hydrocarbons released during this treatment. After the sample is cooled down, a normal TPO experiment is carried out. Fig. 8 shows that the total amount of hydrocarbons released during the helium stripping experiment goes through a maximum at approximately 150, but at 210 C.A. Querini, E.

On LCL-Y catalysts coked at 50 and 80, similar results are obtained. The coke remaining on each catalyst after helium stripping is 18% and 17%, respectively, of the total amount of coke. The amount of hydrocarbons released from these catalysts shows a sudden drop at 500. The TPO carried out after He stripping shows a peak with a maximum at 550. This coke, with aromatic struc- ture, cannot be gasified in an inert carrier gas, and C.A. Querini, E. Roa/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 199-215 211 because of this, the sudden drop in the TPHe is observed at about 500. On the H-Y catalyst, most of the coke is eliminated with helium. The acidity of this catalyst is such that the cracking of the hydro carbons residue is faster than the aromatization at low temperature because, as previously discussed, most of the coke is located in the external surface which facilitates its gasification under an inert gas. This results in a smaller second peak in the TPO spectrum, and in a higher proportion of coke being gasified with helium. In this case, only 7% of the total amount of coke remains on the catalyst after helium stripping at high temperature. Fig. 7 indicates that above 400, the main com- ponents released from the LCL-Y catalyst correspond to the C9+ fraction. This means that coke has been transformed into a highly polymerized structure, which cannot be cracked. These big molecules diffuse very slowly through the pores. At 500 these com- pounds are transformed into heavy coke at a higher rate than the desorption and diffusion processes. Because of this, a sudden drop in the coke gasification rate occurs (Fig. 8). 3.4. Catalyst regeneration Fig. 9 shows activity results for the LCL-Y catalyst after partial coke gasification. Fig. 9A and B show results obtained after heating coked catalysts in a helium stream, up to 200 and 350, respectively, and holding this temperature for 2 h. The activity for fresh catalysts is shown in Fig. 1. After the first regeneration, the catalyst recovered activity but deac- tivates in approximately 10 rain. After a second regen- eration in helium, the catalyst was inactive for TMP production. These results suggest that carbonaceous deposits were transformed into an aromatic structure by thermal treatment, accumulating on the catalyst surface. Depending upon the number of regenerations and conditions, the amount of coke remaining on the catalyst will be sufficiently high and polymerized, in such a way that low temperature regeneration will not be enough to recover the catalyst activity. This was verified by using even higher temperatures and air to burn off coke. Fig. 10 shows activity results of experiments carried out after a first regeneration at 500 and a second one at 450. After the first regeneration, the catalyst recovered activity and dis- played a good stability, even though not as good as the fresh catalyst (see Fig. 1). However, after a second regeneration, at 450, essentially no TMP production is observed. After this activity test, the catalyst was unloaded separated in five fractions from top to bot- tom of the reactor. Fig. 11 shows the TPO spectra of these samples. There is a remarkable change in the proportion of both types of coke along the bed. While the first peak decreases in size, the second one increases along the bed. This means that the propor- tion of heavy (or aromatic) coke increases along the bed after regeneration, even though the total amount of coke does not change. This result is somewhat un- expected since coke profiles measured after normal z O D 0.8 m i-- 0.6 ) m a i-- 0.4 o 0.2 n- D.

One possible reason is that when temperature is increased during regenera- tion, the hydrocarbon released from the top of the reactor can adsorb and polymerize at the bottom. Because of this, a higher proportion of aromatic coke is found at the bottom of the reactor. However, this should be confirmed, more experiments being neces- sary to clarify this observation. C.A.

TPO of the LCL-Y catalyst coked at 80, after partial buming experiments, carried out in various conditions. The crystallinity degree of LCH-Y catalysts, that were regenerated heating in 6% O2/N2 from room temperature up to 500 and 600 at 3.3/min, and holding the final temperature for 2 h, was measured. For the catalyst regenerated at 500, the crystaltinity degree was 95%, and for the other sample, regenerated at 600, it was 86%. Therefore, the activity results obtained with the catalyst regen- erated at 500, showing a loss of activity compared with the fresh catalyst, is not due to a destruction of the zeolite structure, but due to a non-complete coke removal as was previously said. The treatment at 600 led to a decrease in the crystallinity of the zeolite. Fig. 12 shows the TPO of the coke left on the LCL- Y catalyst after partial burning experiments, which were carried out using different final temperatures, final time, and heating rates. These results indicate that even when heating up to 500 and holding this temperature for I h, 0.12% coke is left on the catalyst. This regeneration condition was used in the experi- ment shown in Fig. 10A. Activity results clearly indicate that this small amount of coke is enough to poison the active sites involved in the alkylation reaction. The fresh catalyst is active for 25-30 min. The regenerated catalyst is active for 10 min. As has been proposed by Corma et al. [2], stronger acid sites are required for alkylation as compared to olefin oligomerization. The partial regeneration experiments suggest that a selective deactivation of the stronger acid sites takes place when some coke is left on the catalyst after treating it at high temperatures. The TPO of the catalyst treated at 500 for 1 h shows that there is a shift in the temperature of the maximum compared to the spectra obtained with coke treated at the same temperature but for 12 min. This indicates that a deeper aromatization- graphitization takes place during the treatment at 500 as a function of time. The total amount of ammonia that desorbs from a catalyst regenerated at 500 is lower than on the fresh catalyst (see Fig. 2B). This agrees with the TPO results and activity results. The small amount of coke left on the catalyst strongly affects the catalytic 214 C.A. Querini, E.

Conclusions Lanthanum-exchanged Y-zeolites are active for iso- butane alkylation. The activity and stability of this catalyst are better than H-Y, LCL-MOR, LCH-MOR, H-MOR, or L-zeolite in any form. Superacid catalysts, such as sulfated zirconia, did not show any activity at 80. Large amounts of coke are deposited on those catalysts that show activity for alkylation. It was observed that the higher the stability of the catalyst, the higher the amount of coke deposited during the run. Pore blockage seems to take place during the reaction. Because of this, materials with unidirectional pore structure deactivate faster, as in the case of the mordenite catalyst, and a lower amount of coke is deposited. Reaction temperature plays a key role in catalyst stability. At low temperatures, coke deposition increases because of a fast adsorption-oligomeriza- tion process compared to hydrogen transfer-deso- rption, resulting in a fast coking (pore mouth plugging) reaction. The coke structure remarkably changes as tempera- ture increases. During coke burning or stripping procedures, coke changes from an aliphatic structure to an aromatic structure. This is the reason why the heating rate plays a key role on the amount and nature of the coke left on the catalyst after partial regenera- tion experiments. However, even activity can be par- tially restored when the catalyst is treated in helium or air without a complete coke elimination, this proce- dure leads to an accumulation of residues with high toxicity which completely deactivates the catalyst after a few cycles. Temperatures higher than 500 are needed in order to eliminate all the coke. Solvent extraction, using methylene chloride or a mixture of benzene-methanol, is not effective for catalyst regen- eration. According to our study, it seems that regeneration will be the key step in any process for isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins using solid acid catalysts. High temperatures are needed to fully restore the catalyst performance in air, but this high temperature Acknowledgements The financial support of CAI+D (UNL) is acknowl- edged.

Deactivation of solid acid catalysts during isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins C.A. Querini * E. Roa Instituto de Investigaciones en Catálisis y Petroquímica (INCAPE)-UNL-CONICET Sgo del Estero 2654, 3000 Santa Fe, Argentina * Corresponding author. Tel.: +54 42 555279; fax: +54 42 531068 Coke formation on solid acid catalysts during isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins was studied. Y-zeolite, mordenite and L-zeolite were investigated, as well as sulfated zirconia catalysts. Zeolites were used in protonic form or after ion exchange with lanthanum nitrate. Studies were carried out in liquid phase in a fixed-bed reactor. It was found that Y-zeolite exchanged with lanthanum, being the catalyst with the best stability, is the catalyst that forms higher quantities of carbonaceous deposits. The amount of coke on this catalyst can be as high as 13–14%. This coke requires temperatures higher than 500°C to be completely eliminated. Temperature-programmed analyses indicated that the amount of coke eliminated from the catalyst during partial regeneration, strongly depends on the heating rate. This is due to a competition between coke gasification and its modification in structure leading to an aromatic type of coke, which then requires higher temperatures to be burnt. Pore and surface area measurements carried out on deactivated catalysts suggest that a pore plugging mechanism takes place during the reaction. Catalysts with too strong acidity (e.g. protonic form of Y-zeolite or sulfated zirconia) have no activity for trimethylpentane production at 80°C, most probably due to a very fast deactivation, even though the amount of coke is notably lower than in the lanthanum-exchanged zeolites.
