Graphical abstract This work establishes a novel paradigm for designing highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts via atomic-level structural engineering, offering critical insights for advancing industrial hydroformylation processes. Hydroformylation, a pivotal industrial reaction heavily reliant on Rh-based catalysts, remains limited by Rh scarcity and cost. While Co-based catalysts are potential alternatives, they still face dual challenges of insufficient activity and stability. In this work, Co-based intermetallic catalysts (CoMoIMC and CoWIMC) were synthesized through a layered double hydroxide precursor strategy. During propylene hydroformylation, CoMoIMC exhibited a butyraldehyde production rate of 105.6 mmol·g−1·h−1 (97 % selectivity) with >90 % activity retention over 10 cycles under mild conditions (140 °C, 4.5 MPa), outperforming conventional CoAl2O3 by 2.4-fold. Reactant-TPD experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the ordered Co3Mo/Co3W structures altered CO adsorption from hollow to top sites, reducing the desorption energy from 29.7 to 19.7 kJ·mol−1 and lowering the CO insertion barrier from 1.28 to 1.09 eV. This work proposes a new strategy for preparing highly active and stable non-noble metal hydroformylation catalysts, which has a promising potential for industrial applications.

The resulting aldehydes serve as key intermediates for further transformations into high-value chemicals such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, and esters, finding extensive applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and daily chemical industries [4–6]. In industrial production, homogeneous rhodium-based phosphine ligand catalysts are predominantly employed [7,8]. However, the inherent challenge of separating homogeneous catalysts from catalytic systems results in the wastage of precious metals and the discharge of phosphorus-containing waste [9,10]. Although heterogeneous catalysts can address separation issues, they face critical limitations, including low active-site dispersion, poor selectivity control, and structural collapse due to metal leaching under high-pressure CO environments [11–13]. Hence, designing highly active, highly stable, and low-cost heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts constitutes a pivotal scientific challenge. Recently, Rh-based heterogeneous catalysts have been extensively reported in hydroformylation reactions [14–16]. While activity and selectivity can be enhanced through ligand modulation and single-atom strategies [17–21], they face challenges in large-scale industrial deployment due to limited reserves and high costs. Furthermore, cobalt-based catalysts are increasingly studied due to abundant reserves and cost-effectiveness [22,23]. Researchers have developed multiple approaches to enhance Co-based catalysts, including Co–Co+ synergistic site construction, single-atom dispersion strategies, and carrier defect engineering [24–27]. However, limited by the low electron density and d-orbital electronic configuration of non-noble metals, their CO insertion (the rate-determining step of hydroformylation) remains challenging, necessitating electronic/geometric structure optimization [28]. Intermetallic compounds (IMC) are alloys consisting of two (or more) metallic elements with specific crystal structures and defined atomic compositions [29–31]. The incorporation of secondary metals into the cobalt lattice reconstructs the d-band structure of Co and modulates the adsorption configuration of CO intermediates [32–36]. Concurrently, the ordered crystalline structure confers exceptional stability, effectively mitigating active site leaching during hydroformylation (Fig. 1 ). Based on the methods reported by our group in previous studies, Co–Mo/W intermetallic catalysts were synthesized (CoMoIMC and CoWIMC) via a layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor approach. They exhibit a characteristic hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure confirmed through powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). And the propylene hydroformylation reaction results demonstrate that CoMoIMC achieves a reaction rate of 105.6 mmol·g−1·h−1 with 97 % selectivity toward butyraldehyde under 140 °C and 4.5 MPa. Furthermore, it retained 90 % of its initial activity after 10 cycles and exhibits minimal cobalt leaching (2.6 %). Through kinetic experiments, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the ordered incorporation of Mo/W in intermetallic catalysts modulates the CO adsorption configuration on Co sites, weakens CO adsorption strength, and concomitantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (CO insertion), thereby boosting hydroformylation activity. This work establishes a novel paradigm for designing highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts via atomic-level structural engineering, offering critical insights for advancing industrial hydroformylation processes. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification. Reagents including cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), urea (CO(NH2)2), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), ammonium paratungstate ((NH4)10W12O41·5H2O), and γ-aluminum oxide (γ-Al2O3) were procured from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai). Organic solvents (1,4-dioxane, toluene, n-hexane, cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, 2-propanol, decahydronaphthalene) and oxygenate standards (butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, n-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. High-purity gases (C3H6/CO/H2/N2, 99.99 %) were supplied by Beijing Haipu Gas Co., Ltd. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm) was generated using a Milli-Q system (Millipore). 2.2 Synthesis of Co2AlLDH precursor Co2AlLDH was synthesized via a urea-assisted hydrothermal method. Specifically, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.05 M), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 0.025 M), and urea (CO(NH2)2, 0.5 M) were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous solution. The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and hydrothermally aged at 110 °C for 24 h. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 3 min), washed repeatedly with ethanol/water (v:v = 1:1), and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. 2.3 Synthesis of Co-based intermetallic catalysts CoMoIMC catalysts were synthesized through impregnation. Briefly, 0.3 g Co2AlLDH powder was impregnated with 0.187 g ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) dissolved in 15 mL deionized water. After stirring at room temperature for 4 h, the mixture was heated in a water bath at 60 °C to slowly evaporate the solvent until the sample was dry. The precursor was then reduced in a tubular furnace under flowing H2/N2 (10 vol% H2, 60 mL/min) at 800 °C for 6 h (heating rate: 5 °C/min), followed by natural cooling to room temperature in N2 atmosphere. CoWIMC was prepared analogously by substituting ammonium paratungstate ((NH4)10W12O41·5H2O) as the tungsten source. 2.4 Synthesis of the MAl2O3 (M = Co, Mo, W) reference catalysts For CoAl2O3 reference catalysts, the Co2AlLDH precursor was directly calcined under identical reduction conditions. MoAl2O3 and WAl2O3 controls were prepared by impregnating commercial γ-Al2O3 with corresponding metal precursors, followed by analogous reduced thermal treatment. 2.5 Catalytic evaluations Hydroformylation tests were conducted in a 50 mL autoclave reactor. In a standard protocol, 50 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 15 mL of 1,4-dioxane solvent. The reactor underwent three purge cycles with H2 to eliminate oxygen. The reaction system was pressurized sequentially with 0.5 MPa C3H6, 2 MPa CO, and 2 MPa H2. Reactions proceeded at 140 °C for 2 h under continuous stirring at 700 rpm using a magnetic drive assembly. Product analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-2014C system. Quantification employed 5-point calibration curves (R2 > 0.999) using authentic standards. Kinetic measurement maintained substrate conversion below 20 % through time-dependent sampling to ensure differential reaction conditions. Specific activity was calculated as: (1) Specificacitivity = molofsubstrateconverd Themassofthecatalyst × t i m e ( h ) Aldehyde Selectivity was calculated as: (2) S Adehydes = ( [ n - B u t a n a l ] + i s o - B u t a n a l ) ( [ n - B u t a n a l ] + [ i s o - B u t a n a l ] + [ n - B u t a n o l ] + [ i s o - B u t a n o l ] ) × 100 Normal/Iso Ratio (n/i) was calculated as: (3) n / i = ( [ n - B u t a n a l ] + [ n - B u t a n o l ] ) ( [ i s o - B u t a n a l ] + [ i s o - B u t a n o l ] ) 2.6 Characterizations The elemental composition of Co, Mo and W was analyzed through inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Shimadzu ICPS-7500). XRD patterns of these catalysts were obtained using a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, and 40 mA). BET analysis was performed on a 4-station surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP-2460-4N) using N2 at 77 K. The Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscope, Talos F200X G2 high-resolution transmission electron microscope with Super-X EDS system and Thermo Themis Z spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope were used to perform the morphology of catalysts. Zone axis determination was performed via atomic-resolution STEM fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis combined with lattice symmetry identification. FFT-derived lattice patterns were cross-validated through findlt-based electron diffraction simulations. The XAFS measurement was performed at beamlines 1W1B and 1W2B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), substrate temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD, CO-TPD and C3H6-TPD) were carried out on a Micromeritics Chemi-Sorb 2920 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In the case of H2-TPR measurement, 0.1 g of catalyst was firstly pretreated in Ar atmosphere at 200 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 50 °C. After switching to a H2/Ar (1/9, v/v) mixture gas, a typical temperature programming procedure was conducted from 50 to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 with the signal of H2 consumption monitored through TCD. For the H2-TPD, 0.1 g catalyst was pretreated in 10 % H2/Ar mixture gas at 300 °C for 30 min, followed by purging with Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. After the temperature decreased to 50 °C, H2/Ar (1/9, v/v) mixture gas was introduced for 1 h. Then, pure Ar was purged for 1 h to remove physically-adsorbed H2, followed by increasing the temperature from 50 to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 for the collection of signal. Other substrate TPD conditions were similar to hydrogen TPD. For the experimental method of CO desorption energy determination, the desorption kinetic equation is fitted by variation of the heating rate (β = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 °C/min).

As shown in Fig. S1, Co–Mo/W-based IMCs (CoMoIMC/CoWIMC) were prepared through the impregnation of secondary metals (Mo/W) into the Co2AlLDH matrix, followed by reduction under hydrogen at 900 °C (see Experimental Section). SEM images (Fig. S3a–S5a) display that the catalysts retain the hexagonal platelet morphology of the LDH precursor (diameter ≈ 3 μm), confirming the effectiveness of the topological transformation mechanism. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) compositional analysis (Table S1) shows a 61.0 wt% Co content in LDHs precursor, while the metal compositions of CoMo and CoW catalysts are 38.5 wt% of Co, 30.7 wt% of Mo and 35.5 wt% of Co, 51.9 wt% of W respectively, confirming the successful incorporation of secondary metals. XRD patterns directly illustrate the structural characteristics of three catalysts. As shown in Fig. S2, the XRD patterns of Co–Mo/W-based IMCs (CoMoIMC and CoWIMC) exhibit analogous diffraction features with characteristic peaks at 2θ = 40.6°, 44.0°, and 46.5°. These reflections correspond to the (2 0 0), (0 0 2), and (2 0 1) planes of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases with space group P63/mmc, matching the standard references PDF#04-004-3529 (Co3Mo) and PDF#04-004-2222 (Co3W), respectively. In contrast, the CoAl2O3 control catalyst shows only the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) diffraction peaks of face-centered cubic (fcc, Fm-3m space group) metallic Co at 2θ = 44.2° and 51.5° (PDF#04-001-3274), demonstrating the significant lattice reconstruction and formation of IMC structures. HRTEM analysis (Fig. S3b–S5b) demonstrates that the metal Co or Co-based IMCs nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on γ-Al2O3 support in three catalysts, with average particle sizes of 80.2 nm, 84.2 nm, and 107.2 nm. Direct observation of the atomic arrangement in metallic Co and Co-based IMCs was achieved through HAADF-STEM. Their atomic-scale structural features were further analyzed by EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 2 ). For CoAl2O3 (Fig. 2a–b), the HAADF image along the [0 0 1] zone axis displays a square-symmetry arrangement of bright spots, consistent with the fcc Co atomic model, and EDS elemental mapping confirms homogeneous Co nanoparticle distribution on Al2O3. In CoMoIMC (Fig. 2d–e), a hexagonal honeycomb-like lattice with alternating bright (Mo, Z = 42) and dim (Co, Z = 27) columns along the [001] axis is observed, matching the predicted ordered structure of Co3Mo intermetallic. For CoWIMC (Fig. 2g–h), zigzag-alternating Co (Z = 27) and W (Z = 74) atoms along the [100] axis align perfectly with the Co3W intermetallic model. Atomic-level EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 2f, i) further verifies the long-range ordered distribution of Co–Mo/W atoms without phase segregation, providing direct evidence for the successful formation of IMCs. To probe the electronic and local coordination of Co-based intermetallic catalysts, synchrotron-based XAFS spectroscopy was systematically performed. Co K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3a ) show that the absorption edge positions (E 0) of CoMoIMC, CoWIMC, and CoAl2O3 align closely with that of metallic Co foil (ΔE < 0.5 eV). In the Co K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3b), the dominant Fourier transform peak for Co foil and CoAl2O3 appears at R = 2.18 Å (Co–Co metallic bonding), while for CoMoIMC and CoWIMC, the peaks shift to 2.15 Å and 2.27 Å, respectively, indicating a transition from pure Co–Co bonds to Co–Mo/W intermetallic bonds. Notably, no characteristic peaks of Co–O (1.70 Å) or Co–O–Co (2.91 Å) observed in three catalysts are detected (according to CoO references), ruling out oxide phase formation. Quantitative EXAFS fitting (Table S2) shows a reduction in Co–Co coordination number (CN) from 10.2 in CoAl2O3 (close to ideal fcc Co, CN = 12) to ∼9.0 in the intermetallics, accompanied by the emergence of Co–Mo/W coordination with bond distances of 2.48 Å (Co–Mo) and 2.56 Å (Co–W), respectively. This bond length discrepancy (ΔR = 0.08 Å) correlates with the atomic radius difference between Mo (1.39 Å) and W (1.41 Å). The Mo K-edge XANES analysis (Fig. 3d) displays that the absorption edge energy of CoMoIMC resides between metallic Mo (0 valence) and MoO2 (+4 valence). The EXAFS peak at ∼2.17 Å corresponds to Mo–Co bonds, with no detectable Mo–O bonds (1.98 Å in MoAl2O3), confirming full Mo integration into the Co lattice (Fig. 3e). Similarly, W L3-edge XANES analysis shows the CoWIMC exhibits a near-zero oxidation state, with the EXAFS signal at 2.2 Å uniquely attributed to W–Co bonds, confirming the ordered Co3W phase formation (Fig. 3h). Wavelet transform (WT) analysis of Co K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 3c, f, i) provides enhanced resolution: Compared to Co foil and CoAl, CoMoIMC exhibits intensified wavelet lobes at high k-region (>8 Å−1) due to strong Co–Mo scattering, while CoWIMC shows a distinct signal at k = 12.5 Å−1 associated with coherent Co–W coordination. Additional WT analysis of Mo K-edge and W L3-edge data (Figs. S6–S8) further validates the vibrational modes of Co–Mo/W intermetallic bonds. Collectively, these multiscale spectroscopic results conclusively demonstrate the successful synthesis of atomically ordered Co–Mo/W intermetallic catalysts via the LDH precursor strategy, wherein Co atoms predominantly engage in metallic bonding (Co–Co/M) with Mo/W occupying specific lattice sites. 3.2 Catalytic evaluations towards hydroformylation of propylene The catalytic performance of CoAl2O3 and Co-based IMC catalysts was tested in propylene hydroformylation to produce butyraldehyde. As shown in Fig. 4a , the butyraldehyde yield exhibited a positive correlation with solvent polarity. Both toluene and 1,4-dioxane proved to be effective solvents, achieving hydroformylation yields of 2.7 mmol and 2.4 mmol, respectively. Catalyst activity displayed a volcano-shaped dependence on temperature: the yield increased from 1.1 mmol at 120 °C to 2.4 mmol at 140 °C and then decreased to 0.7 mmol at 160 °C (Fig. 4b). Activity also positively correlated with pressure, with yields rising from 0.9 mmol at 1.5 MPa to 13.5 mmol at 5.5 MPa, accompanied by an increase in the normal-to-iso (n/i) ratio from 1.1 to 1.5 (Fig. 4c). To elucidate the advantages of IMCs in propylene hydroformylation, we compared Co-based IMCs with control catalyst under optimal conditions (140 °C and 4.5 MPa). The CoAl2O3 catalyst exhibits a reaction rate of 3.3 mmol·h−1, achieving full conversion within 8 h. CoMoIMC catalyst demonstrates superior performance with a rate of 5.3 mmol·h−1 (full conversion in 6 h), while CoWIMC catalyst shows a rate of 3.6 mmol·h−1 (full conversion in 8 h). No butyraldehyde formation can be observed over MoAl2O3 or WAl2O3 catalysts, confirming Co as the primary active component (Fig. 4d). Stability tests displayed that CoMoIMC maintains stable activity after an initial slight decline (Fig. 4e), with Co leaching quantified at only 2.6 % after 10 cycles determined by ICP-AES. However, after 3 cycles, CoAl2O3 rapidly deactivates, retaining only 54.7 % of its initial activity by the 6th cycle (Fig. S13). ICP analysis of the post-reaction catalyst reveals a cobalt leaching rate of 23.4 %, which is ninefold higher than that of CoMoIMC. Compared to literature-reported catalysts, the Co-based IMCs achieve efficient conversion at lower temperatures (140 °C vs. >160 °C in prior studies), delivering a specific activity of 105.6 mmol·g−1·h−1—the highest reported value for Co-based systems (Fig. 4f). These results conclusively demonstrate that Co-based IMCs effectively promote catalytic activity while exhibiting exceptional stability. Specifically, the CoMoIMC achieves a 2.2-fold enhancement compared to pure Co catalyst under low conversion conditions. 3.3 Structure-property relationship of hydroformylation over Co-based IMC catalysts Kinetic analysis was performed to investigate the origin of enhanced activity in IMCs, based on apparent activation energy (Ea ) measurements. The Ea values were calculated using the Arrhenius equation (Fig. 5d ), showing distinct barriers of 191 kJ/mol for CoAl2O3, 166 kJ/mol for CoMoIMC, and 107 kJ/mol for CoWIMC, which confirms that IMCs effectively lower the reaction energy barriers. Intriguingly, although CoWIMC possesses the lowest activation energy barrier (Ea = 106 kJ/mol), it does not exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to CoMoIMC. To probe this apparent paradox between energy barrier reduction and activity trends, we further investigated substrate adsorption and conversion dynamics through TPD. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, H2, CO, and propylene desorption peaks on CoAl2O3, CoMoIMC, and CoWIMC surfaces are predominantly located in low-temperature regions. In these three catalysts, H2 desorption temperatures show no significant variation, while propylene displays a moderate decrease from 117 °C to 102 °C (ΔT = 15 °C). CO undergoes a pronounced reduction from 143 °C to 119 °C (ΔT = 24 °C). These results demonstrate that IMC formation weakens the adsorption strength of both CO and propylene, with particularly pronounced effects on CO. Multi-heating-rate CO-TPD kinetic analyses (Fig. 5e) further confirmed this trend, presenting desorption activation energies of 29.7 kJ/mol (CoAl2O3), 22.9 kJ/mol (CoMoIMC), and 19.7 kJ/mol (CoWIMC). To investigate CO desorption effects on catalytic activity, kinetic reaction order experiments were conducted. For CoMoIMC, the reaction orders concerning H2, CO, and propylene partial pressures were 1.0, 3.2, and 1.7, respectively (Fig. S9). Notably, IMCs exhibited higher CO sensitivity (reaction order: 3.2 for CoMoIMC; 4.0 for CoWIMC) compared to CoAl2O3 (2.6), consistent with their weakened CO adsorption as evidenced by TPD (Fig. 5f). The results demonstrate that CO conversion (carbonyl insertion) constitutes the rate-determining step (RDS). Additionally, the weaker CO adsorption on CoWIMC surfaces corresponds to its inferior catalytic performance compared to CoMoIMC under lower CO partial pressure conditions. Based on STEM characterization and crystallographic data of Co-based catalysts, different structures — the (0 0 1) crystal plane of Co metal, Co3Mo and Co3W IMCs — were employed to systematically investigate CO adsorption behavior over three catalysts, with comprehensive calculations of all potential adsorption sites. The results reveal distinct adsorption preferences over three catalysts: CO predominantly occupies hollow sites on Co(001) (−2.26 eV) while preferentially binding to top sites on Co3Mo(001) (−1.53 eV) and Co3W(001) (−1.03 eV), as quantitatively demonstrated in Fig. 5j. The variation in adsorption energy aligns with CO-TPD results, exhibiting a CO adsorption strength hierarchy of CoAl2O3 > CoMoIMC > CoWIMC. To elucidate the origin of differences in adsorption energies and configurations, we further investigated the electronic interactions between CO and adsorption sites through charge density difference (CDD) analysis, Bader charge partitioning, and Crystal Orbital Hamiltonian Population (COHP) calculations. CDD and Bader charge analyses (Fig. 5g–i) exhibited decreasing electron transfer from metal to CO antibonding orbitals: 0.76 e (Co), 0.31 e (Co3Mo), and 0.16 e (Co3W), indicating suppressed electron-donating capacity in IMCs due to Mo/W incorporation. COHP analysis further quantifies Co–C bonding interactions, with integrated COHP (ICOHP) values decreasing from −3.22 eV (Co) to −1.82 eV (Co3Mo) and −1.77 eV (Co3W) (Fig. 5k), signifying weakened intermediate adsorption in IMCs. These results demonstrate that ordered IMC architectures induce distinctive electron coordination effects on CO molecules. Combining kinetic experiments with prior mechanistic studies, we confirm carbonyl insertion as the RDS. Therefore, the reaction energy barrier of the CO carbonyl insertion process was quantified via transition state theory (TST) calculations. The barriers of carbonyl insertion over CoAl2O3, CoMoIMC, and CoWIMC catalysts are 1.28, 1.11, and 1.09 eV, respectively (Fig. 5l), demonstrating consistency with experimental Ea trends. This accounts for the enhanced activity of IMC catalysts relative to pure Co catalysts. 4 Conclusion In this work, atomically ordered CoMoIMC and CoWIMC catalysts were synthesized via a Co2Al-LDH precursor approach, with ordered IMC phase formation confirmed by XRD, atomic-resolution STEM and XAFS. Both intermetallic compound (IMC) catalysts showed superior propylene hydroformylation performance. Specifically, the CoMoIMC catalyst achieved a butyraldehyde production rate of 105.6 mmol·g−1·h−1 (97 % selectivity) at 140 °C and 4.5 MPa, representing a 2.4-fold increase over the conventional CoAl2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, over 90 % of its initial activity was retained after 10 reaction cycles. Combined reactant-TPD, kinetic experiments, and DFT calculations revealed that Mo/W incorporation suppresses electron transfer from metallic sites to CO, weakens CO adsorption strength, and reduces the energy barrier for the rate-determining carbonyl insertion step. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing high-activity, high-stability Co-based heterogeneous catalysts for the hydroformylation reaction, demonstrating significant potential for industrial applications.

        "dc:description": "Hydroformylation, a pivotal industrial reaction heavily reliant on Rh-based catalysts, remains limited by Rh scarcity and cost. While Co-based catalysts are potential alternatives, they still face dual challenges of insufficient activity and stability. In this work, Co-based intermetallic catalysts (CoMoIMC and CoWIMC) were synthesized through a layered double hydroxide precursor strategy. During propylene hydroformylation, CoMoIMC exhibited a butyraldehyde production rate of 105.6 mmol·g−1·h−1 (97 % selectivity) with >90 % activity retention over 10 cycles under mild conditions (140 °C, 4.5 MPa), outperforming conventional CoAl2O3 by 2.4-fold. Reactant-TPD experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the ordered Co3Mo/Co3W structures altered CO adsorption from hollow to top sites, reducing the desorption energy from 29.7 to 19.7 kJ·mol−1 and lowering the CO insertion barrier from 1.28 to 1.09 eV. This work proposes a new strategy for preparing highly active and stable non-noble metal hydroformylation catalysts, which has a promising potential for industrial applications.",
