Cyclodextrin modification for para-selective hydroxymethylation and hydroxyethylation of phenol Tatsuya Morozumi, Hiroshi Uetsuka, Makoto Komiyama\"* Institute of Materials Science, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305 (Japan) and Josef Pitha National Institute of Health, NIA/GRC, BaltinO, MD 21224 (U.S.A.) (Received May 7, 1991; accepted May 28, 1991) Abstract 4-(Hydroxymethyl)phenol is selectively synthesized from phenol and formaldehyde by use of 6-cyclodextrirks ( 3-CyDs) carrying quaternary ammonium, glucose and maltose residues as catalysts. The chemical modification of ss-CyD largely promotes the catalytic activity, especially the rate-accelerating effect. Yield of the desired para-substituted product (16.8 mo1%) for the ss-CyD having the quaternary ammonium substituent (0.3 M) is 7.3 times as large as that (2.3 mol%) for unmodified 3-CyD (the selectivities are 80 and 79%, respectively). Selective synthesis of 4-(hydroxyethyl)phenol from phenol and acetaldehyde is successfully achieved also by use of the ss-CyD derivatives having sugar branches, which is in marked contrast with the marginal activity of unmodified /3CyD. Introduction Selective organic synthesis by use of cyclodextrins (CyDs), cyclic oligomers of 6-8 glucose units, as catalysts has recently attracted much interest [ 1-4 ]. However, CyDs do not necessarily exhibit sufficient catalytic activity in all the desired reactions. One of the approaches to overcome these shortcomings is to introduce appropriate functional groups to CyDs by chemical modification, as widely applied for the development of elegant enzyme mimics [5]. However, use of these chemically modified CyDs for organic synthesis has seldom been reported. Previously [6], the authors showed that 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (Ia), a fairly important industrial chemical, is selectively synthesized from phenol and formaldehyde by use of CyDs (eqn. (1)). Formation of the ortho-substituted byproduct, 2-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (Ila), is effectively suppressed. However, the yield of la in the selective synthesis is rather low, and thus molecular *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. * *Current address: Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Tokyo 113, Japan. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 400 design of modified CyDs for acceleration of the reaction is desired. Introduction of 2-hydroxypropyl residues at the primary hydroxyl side of CyD did not increase the yield, although the selectivity was substantially increased by the modification [7]. OH OH OH 0 ~ &RHOH R-CH R (1) R-CHOH a:R_-H I 11 b: R=CH3 The present paper reports that activities of CyDs for the selective synthesis of Ia are remarkably promoted by introduction of substituents carrying quaternary ammonium, diethylamino, glucose and maltose residues to CyDs. Roles of the substituents in the catalysis are proposed based on spectroscopic evidence. In addition, catalytic activities of these modified CyDs for the selective synthesis of 4-(hydroxyethyl)phenol (Ib), another important chemical, from phenol and acetaldehyde (also shown in eqn. (1)) are described. Experimental Materials The modified CyDs employed in this study are depicted in F`ig. 1. CyDs having quaternary ammonium residues (QA-CyDs) were prepared by the reactions of CyDs with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride in aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions (29 wt.%). Two QA-ss-CyDs of different average degrees of substitution DS (2.8 and 4.0, as estimated by elemental analysis) were prepared. DS values of QA-a-CyD and QA-y-CyD were 1.9 and 1.3, re- X:-0-CH2-CH-CHI NMe3 (OA-CYD) OH Secondary X:-0-CH-CH-NEt2 (DEAE-CyD) hydroxyl side OH X: -0-CHZ-cH-CH3 ( HP-CYD) OH 0 X:-0 HO OH (Gt-CyD) H OH X:-0 HO OH X O E H OH (G2-CyD) Primary.

CyDs having diethylaminoethyl residues (DEAF-CyDs) were obtained from CyDs and 2-chloroethyl N, N-diethylamine hydrochloride (DSs for a-, /3-, and y-CyDs were 6, 10 and 9, respectively). /3-CyD having 2-hydroxypropyl residues (HP-/3-CyD) [ 9 ] was a generous gift by Wako Pure Chemical Co. The average number of 2-hydroxypropyl residues per 6-CyD residue (mostly at the primary hydroxyl side) was determined to be 5.5 by 1H NMR spectroscopy. CyDs having a glucose branch, one maltose branch, and two maltose branches (G,-CyDs, G2-CyDs, and G2,G2-CyDs, respectively) were kindly provided by Ensuiko Sugar Refinery Co. Purities were confirmed by HPLC. Attempts to separate the regioisomers of G2,G2-CyDs have not yet been successful. Authentic samples of rb and IIb for HPLC analysis were prepared by reduction of the corresponding hydroxyacetophenones by NaBH4. Selective synthesis of la and Ib Selective synthesis of Ia and lb was initiated by addition of aqueous solutions of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde to the reaction mixture, and was carried out at 30 C. The reaction was followed by periodical HPLC analysis (Merck Lichrospher 18(e) column, 25 cm, 8:2 water-ethanol solution). Formation of phenols having two or more hydroxymethyl (or hydroxyethyl) substituents did not take place. Kinetic study The equilibrium constant Kd for the dissociation of the molecular complex involved in the QA- 3-CyD-induced selective synthesis was determined by plotting 1 /(Robsd -R J Vs. 1 /[QA-/3-CyD ]o according to the literature method [ 1 ]. Robsd and R , the rates of the total reaction in the presence and the absence of QA-/3-CyD, were expressed in terms of the yields after 1 day reaction time. Spectroscopy 13C NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer at 30 C. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (Na salt) was used as internal standard, and adjustment of pD was made immediately before the spectral measurement. Results and Discussion Selective synthesis of Id Selective synthesis of la was successfully achieved in 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions by use of the modified /3-CyDs: QA-ss-CyD, G2-/3CyD, and G2,G2-ss-CyD, as shown in Table 1. The Ia/IIa ratios are considerably larger than the value (2.8) in their absence. Significantly, all the modified 3-CyDs give much higher yields than unsubstituted ss-CyD. The yield (16.8 402 TABLE 1 Selective synthesis of la from phenol and formaldehyde at 30 Ca Catalyst Yield (molg6)b Selectivity (Ia/Ila) Ia Ila QA-ss-CyD` 16.8 4.3 3.9 QA-/3-CyDd 5.0 1.2 4.2 G2-/3-CyD 6.0 1.5 4.0 GZ,Gz-P-CyD 7.6 1.5 5.1 HP-ss-CyD 1.0 0.2 5.0 p-CyD 2.3 0.6 3.8 QA-y-CyD 7.0 2.0 3.5 y-CyD 2.6 1.2 2.2 QA-a-CyD 6.7 2.9 2.3 a-CyD 2.6 1.1 2.3 none 1.1 0.4 2.8 a[phenollo=0.015 M; [NaOHIo=0.75 M; [HCHOIo=0.29 M; [catalystlo=0.3 M; for 1 day. VVith respect to the charged phenol. `Average number of quaternary ammonium residues per mole of 3-CyD (DS) is 2.8. d DS is 4.0. mol%) for QA-(3-CyD of DS 2.8 is 7.3 times as large as the value (2.3 mol%) for 6-CyD. The selectivity-enhancing activities of the modified ss-CyDs are comparable with that of unsubstituted O-CyD. The yield for QA-/3-CyD of DS 4.0 is lower than the value for that of DS 2.8. Thus introduction of - 3 quaternary ammonium residues to 6-CyD is optimal for effective rate acceleration. Similar acceleration by the quaternary ammonium residues was perceived in QA-a-CyD and QA-y-CyD. For HP-/3-CyD, the reaction rates are almost identical with the value for unsubstituted 6-CyD, but its selectivity-enhancing activity is remarkable. Thus attachment of the quaternary ammonium or sugar residues to (3-CyD is essential to accomplish sufficient rate acceleration. DEAF-a-CyD and DEAF-y-CyD effectively accelerated the reaction (yields 4.8 and 7.8 mo1%, respectively). However, the yield for DEAE-/3-CyD was the same as that for O-CyD. Reaction mechanism of the QA-1i-CyD-induced selective .synthesis of Ia The reaction rate and the Ia/IIa ratio monotonically increased with increasing concentration of (1~-ss-CyD. Here the rate of formation of Ia increased more than did the rate of formation of IIa. The selective catalysis by QA-ss-CyD is ascribed to a dominant acceleration of the para-reaction. At large values of [QA-ss-CyD]o, both the reaction rate and the Ia/IIa ratio showed saturation phenomena. Apparently QA-/3-CyD forms a complex either with phenolate or with formaldehyde, prior to electrophilic attack of 403 formaldehyde toward phenolate. The equilibrium constant Kd for the selective synthesis by QA-ss-CyD (DS 2.8) was determined to be 0.15 M by kinetic methods (see Experimental section). Complex formation between phenolate and QA-ss-CyD has been confirmed by '3C NMR spectroscopy. On addition of QA-/3-CyD (DS 2.8), NMR signals of all the carbon atoms of phenolate shifted toward higher magnetic field. The shifts were 1.5 ppm (C-1 carbon), 1.7 ppm (ortho-carbon), 2.0 ppm (ortho-carbon), and 2.2 ppm (para-carbon), when [phenolate], = 0.03 and [QA-ss-CyD ]o = 0.17 M in 0.75 N aqueous NaOH solutions. It is noteworthy that the magnitudes of the chemical shift changes for the four types of carbon atoms are almost identical with each other. These results indicate that the complex between QA-,6-CyD and phenolate exists as a mixture of two conformers (a) and (b) (see Fig. 2) in solution, which are in rapidly exchange. In conformer (b) the phenolate is included into the cavity of QA-,6-CyD with the para-carbon atom first, whereas in conformer (a) the phenoxide oxygen enters the cavity first. Most of the previously studied complexes between CyDs and phenol or its derivatives involve inclusion of the para-carbon atom first, in the same way as conformer (b) [ 1 ]. The stability of conformer (a) in the present case is attributable to electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of phenoxide oxygen and the positive charges of QA-ss-CyD. If either conformer (a) or (b) alone were predominant in the solutions, the magnitude of the chemical shift change would monotonically increase with increasing depth of penetration [10]. The reaction rate linearly increased with the charged concentration of formaldehyde up to 0.4 M on keeping the charged concentrations of phenolate and QA-,6-CyD constant at 0.015 and 0.3 M, respectively. This result rules out the possibility that QA-,6-CyD and formaldehyde form a rather stable complex prior to chemical transformation, since then saturation phenomena would be observed*.

Proposed conformations (a) and (b) of the complex between QA-ss-CyD and phenolate. *The plot of the reaction rate vs. [HCHO]o showed some positive deviation from the straight line when [HCHO]o was larger than 0.4 M. Although the reason for the positive deviation is not yet clear, it does not affect the conclusion in the present paper. 404 The present selective synthesis proceeds via conformer (b) rather than conformer (a), as inferred from the significant rate acceleration by Qtr-ssCyD. In conformer (b), electrophilic attack of formaldehyde (mostly hydrated in aqueous solution [ 11 ]) on the pares-carbon atom of the phenolate in the cavity is greatly accelerated, since the negatively charged transition state [ 12 ] is electrostatically stabilized by the positive charges of the quaternary ammonium ions. In conformer (a), however, the negatively charged transition state is destabilized by the negative charges of the secondary alkoxide ions of the ss-CyD residue: most of the secondary hydroxyl groups (pKa - 12 [ 1 ]) exist in anionic states in the present reaction mixtures. The complex between phenolate and G1-ss-CyD or G2-ss-CyD also involves two conformers with penetration of either the pares-carbon first or the phenoxide oxygen first, as indicated by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The upfield shifts for the C-1, ortho-, metes- and pares-carbon atoms are 3.2, 2.0, 2.2 and 2.0 ppm,, respectively. In the first conformer, which is the productive one, the hydroxyl groups of the sugar branches can function as general acid catalysts. Proton donation to the hydroxyl groups of hydrated formaldehyde (methylene glycol) decreases the electron density at the adjacent carbon atom, facilitating its electrophilic attack on phenolate. Selective synthesis of Ib The selective synthesis of l1b from phenol and acetaldehyde was carried out at pH 10. Use of this media was essential, since in highly alkaline media (e.g. 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions used above for the selective synthesis of Ia) base-catalyzed aldol condensation of acetaldehyde was dominant. The formation of lb was too slow at pH 9. At pH 10, selective synthesis is successful without measurable concurrent aldol condensation of acetaldehyde. The modified G-CyDs, Gl-ss-CyD, G2-ss-CyD, Gz,G2- 3-CyD, and HP-/3CyD strongly increased the selectivity for the formation of lb (Table 2). The increase in selectivity was ascribed to suppression of formation of the byproduct IIb. The 1b/11b ratio 3.7 (selectivity 79%) was achieved with G1-ss-CyD (0.3 M). In the absence of the modified G-CyDs, however, formation of Ib and IIb proceeds at almost the same rates, and the Ib/IIb ratio is only 1.2 (selectivity 55%). Chemical modification of /3-CyD is definitely necessary for effective selective synthesis. When /3-CyD was used in place of the modified /3-CyDs, a large amount of 6-CyD precipitated in the reaction mixture, and the lb/ IIb ratio was 1.5 (selectivity 60%). The larger catalytic activities for the modified ss-CyDs are (at least partially) ascribed to greater solubilities. \"C NMR spectroscopy showed that phenolate predominantly penetrates into the cavity of Gl P-CyD with the phenoxide oxygen atom first (see Fig. 3). The shifts were + 5.7 ppm for C-1, + 2.6 ppm for ortho, + 1.8 ppm for metes and - 0.2 ppm for para (positive sign: shift toward higher magnetic field), when [phenol]o = 0.075 and [GI-ss-CyD to = 0.225 M at pD 11. Similar results were obtained with the use of G2-/3-CyD in place of Gl-/3-CyD.

Proposed structure of the complex between Gj- or G2-/3-CyD and phenolate. relative magnitudes of the changes in chemical shifts as well as their directions are in fair parallel with the values observed on protonation of phenolate*, indicating that a hydrogen bond is formed between the phenoxide oxygen and the sugar residue(s) located on the primary hydroxyl side of the ss-CyD cavity. The secondary hydroxyl groups of the sugar branches have small pK$ values (- 12 [ 13 J), and are highly effective hydrogen donors. In the conformation depicted in Fig. 3, the ortho positions of phenolate are protected by the wall of the /3-CyD residue from attack by acetaldehyde, enhancing the selectivity for the para-reaction. Suppression of the conversion of phenol by these modified /3-CyDs is consistent with the argument, since proton donation from the sugar branches to phenolate decreases the nucleophilicity of the aromatic nuclei. *The chemical shift changes of phenolate on the protonation are + 14.4 ppm for C-1, + 5.4 ppm for ortho, + 2.0 ppm for meta, and - 3.8 ppm for para. 406 QA-/3-CyD, effective catalyst for the selective synthesis of la, had no significant effect either on the reaction rate or on the selectivity here. sand y-CyDs without chemical modification showed no catalytic activity. Introduction of two maltose branches to a-CyD (G2,G2-a-CyD) did not increase the activity. Attempts to increase the yield of lb, together with increased selectivity, are currently under way. In conclusion, 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (Ia) and 4-(hydroxyethyl)phenol (lb) are selectively synthesized by use of chemically modified cyclodextrins. These results indicate that selective catalysts for varieties of organic syntheses can be prepared by chemical modification of cyclodextrins according to precise molecular design.

Selective synthesis of 4-(hydroxyethyl)phenol from phenol and acetaldehyde is successfully achieved also by use of the β-CyD derivatives having sugar branches, which is in marked contrast with the marginal activity of unmodified β-CyD.",
