DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60145-X Vapor-Phase Synthesis of 3-Methylindole over Fe-, Co-, or Ni-Promoted Ag/SiO 2 Catalysts LÜ Wenhui, LIU Xinghai, LIU Dongyan, SHI Lei * , SUN Qi Institute of Chemistry for Functionalized Materials, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian 116029, Liaoning, China Abstract: Fe, Co, or Ni as a promoter was added into the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol. The promoted Ag/SiO 2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, and thermogravimetry. The results indicated that the addition of Fe or Ni to Ag/SiO 2 was favorable for the increase of the catalyst selectivity. Among them, Fe could reinforce the interaction between the silver active component and the support and greatly promote the dispersion of silver particles on the support, which resulted in the remarkable increase in the initial activity of the catalyst. Adding Co or Ni to Ag/SiO 2 promoted the sintering of silver during the reaction although it reduced the coking a little. As a result, the stability of the catalysts decreased. Key words: iron; cobalt; nickel; promoter; silver; silica; supported catalyst; 3-methylindole Indole and its derivatives are important nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds and are widely used in medicine, pesticides, perfumes, food, feed additives, and fuels [1–5]. 3-Methylindole, an important indole derivative, can be used as a spice [6] and to synthesize anti-inflammatory drugs, antibi- otics, dyes, and plant growth hormones [7]. The synthesis of 3-methylindole has a practical value. There are many methods for the synthesis of 3-methylindole [8–10]. The traditional liquid phase syntheses have many drawbacks, such as the use of complicated reagents, which is expensive, use of toxic solvents, which causes heavy pollution, and have difficult separation and purification of products, etc. [11–13]. The vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole would be better from the aspect of atom economy. There are few reports on the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole. Gopal et al. [14] reported the synthesis of 3-methylindole from indole and methanol using a CeHY zeo- lite catalyst, and getting a 30% yield of 3-methylindole. Campanati et al. [15] developed a ZrO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst for the synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol and got a 3-methylindole yield of 12%. Our research showed that Ag/SiO 2 is an active catalyst for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol [16]. Fe, Co, and Ni have exhibited a good promoter role in many catalytic reactions [17–20]. In this paper, Fe, Co, or Ni as the promoter was introduced into the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst, and the effect of the promoter on the catalytic properties was studied. X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction by H 2 , and thermogravimetry were used to investigate the relationship between the catalyst structure and the catalytic performance. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness method. After impregnating SiO 2 with an appropriate amount of silver nitrate aqueous solution for 12 h at room temperature, the sample was dried at 120 o C for 4 h and then calcined at 500 o C for 4 h. The catalysts Ag/M/SiO 2 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) were prepared by sequential impregnation. The promoter, Fe, Co, or Ni, was first loaded on the surface of SiO 2 , and silver was then loaded. The process used was the same as in the preparation of the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst. The silver loading per unit mass of the SiO 2 support was 0.45 mmol/g. The amount of Fe, Co, and Ni was 0.075, 0.100, and 0.150 mmol/g, respectively. LÜ Wenhui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1287–1290 1.2 Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed con- tinuous flow glass reactor (12 mm i.d.). Prior to the activity test, the catalyst precursor (3 ml) was reduced in a mixture of 25% H 2 -75% N 2 at 120 o C for 1 h. The conditions were atmospheric pressure, 260 o C, aniline/1,2-propanediol molar ratio = 3:1, LHSV = 0.4 h –1 , and SV = 1700 h –1 . The reactants and products were analyzed by an SP-6800A gas chromatograph (Shandong Lunan Ruihong Company, China) using a SE-54 column. 1.3 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns were recorded by a Bruker D8 Advance dif- fraction apparatus with a Cu K . source at 0.5°/min in the 2 range of 30°–60°. The voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out in a quartz reactor (6 mm i.d., 350 mm length). A 100 mg sample was pretreated in a flow of ultra pure nitrogen of 50 ml/min at 200 o C for 1 h. After the sample was cooled to 50 o C, the reduction gas of 10% H 2 /Ar (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor and the temperature was increased to 400 o C at a linear heating rate of 10 o C/min. The hydrogen consumption was recorded with a thermal conduc- tivity detector. TG analysis was carried out with a Diamond TG/DTA ap- paratus (Perkin Elmer). First, about 7 mg of the sample was heated from room temperature to 300 o C (10 o C/min) under ultra pure nitrogen (20 ml/min) to remove physical adsorbed species. This was then cooled to 60 o C and heated in flowing air (20 ml/min) to 800 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min. The changes in the sample mass with temperature were recorded. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The effect of Fe, Co, or Ni promoter on the perform- ance of the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst Table 1 shows the activity and selectivity at the first hour of the reaction over Ag/SiO 2 and Ag/SiO 2 doped with Fe, Co, or Ni. It can be seen that the conversion of 1,2-propanediol de- creased a little after the addition of Fe, Co, or Ni. The addition of Fe can increase the yield of 3-methylindole and selectivity to 33.1% and 49.8% from 23.8% and 35.7%, respectively, in the case of no promoter. However, the selectivity for 3-methyl- indole did not increase remarkably after adding Co or Ni to the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst. Figure 1 shows the yield of 3-methylindole with time on stream over the silver-based catalysts. Over the Ag/SiO 2 cata- lyst, the yield of 3-methylindole dropped from 23.8% to 10.4% in 4 h. After adding Fe to Ag/SiO 2 , the yield of 3-methylindole decreased from 33.1% to 16.5% in the same period although the initial yield of 3-methylindole was remarkably increased. The yield of 3-methylindole decreased by 14.3% and 13.6%, respectively, in 4 h after adding Co or Ni to Ag/SiO 2 . From the results, it can be suggested that adding Fe, Co, or Ni to the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst did not promote the stability of the catalyst. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh and used catalysts of Ag/SiO 2 , Ag/Fe/SiO 2 , Ag/Co/SiO 2 , and Ag/Ni/SiO 2 . Two diffraction peaks at 38.2° and 44.3° assigned to the (111) and (220) reflections of silver, respectively, can be seen on the fresh Ag/SiO 2 catalyst. No silver diffraction peaks were observed after the addition of Fe to Ag/SiO 2 , which in- dicated that Fe helped to disperse silver on the silica. The intensity of the silver diffraction peaks became stronger after adding Co to Ag/SiO 2 and did not change with the Ag/Ni/SiO 2 catalyst, which indicated that Co or Ni did not help to disperse the active component silver. It was because Fe promoted the dispersion of the silver particles on the surface of the support and generated more active sites that resulted in the remarkable increase in the initial yield of 3-methylindole. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the intensities of the silver diffraction peaks from the used silver-based catalysts became stronger than those from the fresh catalysts, which indicated Table 1 Activity and selectivity of different Ag-based catalysts for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol Catalyst 1,2-Propanediol conversion (%) 3-Methylindole yield (%) 3-Methylindole selectivity (%) Ag/SiO 2 66.7 23.8 35.7 Ag/Fe/SiO 2 66.4 33.1 49.8 Ag/Co/SiO 2 65.3 23.4 35.8 Ag/Ni/SiO 2 64.2 25.2 39.3 Reaction conditions: 260 °C, LHSV = 0.4 h �1 , SV = 1700 h �1 , ani- line/1,2-propanediol molar ratio = 3, H 2 = 10 ml/min, steam = 30 ml/min, N 2 = 40 ml/min.

LÜ Wenhui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1287–1290 that the silver particles agglomerated during the reaction, re- sulting in the fleet deactivation of the catalysts. The clear silver diffraction peaks seen on the used Ag/Fe/SiO 2 indicated that Fe did not inhibit the sintering of silver particles during the reac- tion although it helped to disperse the silver in the fresh catalyst. The intensity of the silver diffraction peaks on used Ag/SiO 2 doped with Co or Ni became much stronger than that on used Ag/SiO 2 , which indicated that adding Co or Ni to the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst aggravated the sintering of the silver particles in the reaction. To further probe the role of Fe, Co, and Ni, the samples were investigated by H 2 -TPR. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Two reduction peaks were observed on the samples of Ag 2 O/SiO 2 , Ag 2 O/Fe/SiO 2 , and Ag 2 O/Ni/SiO 2 , whereas only one H 2 con- sumption peak was seen on Ag 2 O/Co/SiO 2 . Because no reduc- tion peaks were seen on Fe/SiO 2 , Co/SiO 2 , and Ni/SiO 2 in the reduction temperature range, it can be concluded that the re- duction peaks from Ag 2 O/SiO 2 and Ag 2 O/SiO 2 doped with Fe, Co or Ni were due to the reduction of Ag 2 O. There were two dispersion states for Ag 2 O on the samples of Ag 2 O/SiO 2 , Ag 2 O/Fe/SiO 2 , and Ag 2 O/Ni/SiO 2 because there were two reduction peaks. From the XRD results in Fig. 2 it can be suggested that on the samples of Ag 2 O/SiO 2 and Ag 2 O/Ni/SiO 2 , the reduction peak at the lower temperature was due to the reduction of small Ag 2 O particles, while the reduction peak at the higher temperature was due to the reduction of large Ag 2 O particles. However, on the sample of Ag 2 O/Fe/SiO 2 the reduc- tion peak at the lower temperature was attributed to the reduc- tion of microcrystalline Ag 2 O, and the reduction peak at the higher temperature was due to the reduction of small Ag 2 O particles (particle size �10 nm). On comparing the reduction temperatures of the samples, it can be seen that the reduction peaks shifted to higher temperature after adding Fe, Co, or Ni to Ag 2 O/SiO 2 , and the reduction temperature was highest after adding Fe to Ag 2 O/SiO 2 . This indicated that there was a strong interaction between Ag 2 O and the support in the sample of Ag 2 O/Fe/SiO 2 , which resulted in the better dispersion of the Ag 2 O particles on the support. Generally, coke will be formed on the surface of an acidic catalyst during the reaction, which results in the deactivation of the catalyst. In order to investigate whether there was deacti- vation due to coking and to calculate the change in the coke content after adding Fe, Co, or Ni to the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst, thermogravimetric analyses of the used silver-based catalysts were carried out. Because the catalyst sample was heated from room temperature to 300 o C (10 o C/min) under ultra pure ni- trogen (20 ml/min) to remove physically adsorbed species, then cooled to 60 o C and heated in flowing air (20 ml/min) to carry out the TG experiment, it can be taken that the mass loss recorded corresponded to the coke content on the catalyst 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 o Ag o o 2 T /( o ) (8) (7) (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1) In te n s ity Fig. 2.

LÜ Wenhui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1287–1290 during the reaction. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that there were mass losses from the used catalysts of Ag/SiO 2 and Ag/SiO 2 doped with Fe, Co, or Ni. This indicated that coke was formed on the surface of the catalyst during the reaction. The coke content on the catalyst decreased a little after adding Co or Ni to Ag/SiO 2 , whereas there was no obvious change after the addition of Fe to Ag/SiO 2 . 3 Conclusions Adding Fe or Ni to the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst increased the se- lectivity of the catalyst. Adding Fe increased the yield of 3-methylindole remarkably. The results indicated that the deactivation of the catalysts resulted from the sintering of silver particles and coking on the surface. Although Fe rein- forced the interaction between silver and the support and promoted the silver dispersion on the support, which gave the increase of the initial activity of the catalyst, it did not inhibit the sintering of silver particles and the coking on the surface during the reaction. Therefore, the stability of the Ag/Fe/SiO 2 catalyst was still poor. Adding Co or Ni to Ag/SiO 2 can de- crease the coking a little but aggravated the sintering of the silver particles during the reaction, which resulted in the deg- radation of the stability of Ag/Co/SiO 2 or Ag/Ni/SiO 2 .

The promoted Ag/SiO2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and thermogravimetry. The results indicated that the addition of Fe or Ni to Ag/SiO2 was favorable for the increase of the catalyst selectivity. Among them, Fe could reinforce the interaction between the silver active component and the support and greatly promote the dispersion of silver particles on the support, which resulted in the remarkable increase in the initial activity of the catalyst. Adding Co or Ni to Ag/SiO2 promoted the sintering of silver during the reaction although it reduced the coking a little. As a result, the stability of the catalysts decreased.",
