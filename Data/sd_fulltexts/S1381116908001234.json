Graphical abstract The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) performances of iron-based catalysts promoted with/without potassium compounds containing different acidic structural promoters (Al2O3, SiO2, and ZSM-5) were studied in this research. The figure shows the effect of different potassium promoters on hydrocarbon selectivity and the results can be explained from the interaction between potassium and structure promoters, and the spillover of reactants or intermediates from Fe sites to the surfaces of structural promoters. The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) performances of iron-based catalysts promoted with/without potassium compounds containing different acidic structural promoters (Al2O3, SiO2, and ZSM-5) were studied in this research. Characterization technologies of temperature-programmed reduction with CO (CO-TPR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES) were used to study the effect of K–structural promoter interactions on the carburization behaviors of catalysts. It showed that the addition states of potassium (K–Al2O3, K–SiO2, K–ZSM-5 and K-free) have a significant influence on the formation of iron carbides, which shows a following sequence in promotion of carburization: K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 >K–ZSM-5>K-free. The FTS reaction test was performed in a fixed bed reactor. It is found that Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst leads to the highest CO conversion, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest H2 conversion, and Fe/K-free catalyst shows the lowest CO and H2 conversion. As for the hydrocarbon selectivity, Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst yields the lowest methane and the highest C5 + products, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst yields higher methane and the highest liquid hydrocarbon product, whereas Fe/K-free catalyst yields the highest methane and the lowest C5 + products. These results can be explained from the interaction between potassium and structure promoters, and the spillover of reactants or intermediates from Fe sites to the surfaces of structural promoters. Keywords Fischer–Tropsch synthesis Iron-based catalysts Potassium promoter Structure promoter Interaction 1 Introduction Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has been recognized as an important technology in the production of liquid fuels and chemicals from syngas derived from coal, natural gas, and other carbon-containing materials [1]. With the emergency of transportation fuel shortage in the whole world and the pollution from the combustion of fuels refined from petroleum, FTS is becoming a much concerned academic or industrial topic for more and more people, especially in China [2]. The current focus on the FTS process deals with the production of transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel [3], which can be maximized via oligomerization or hydrocracking of FTS effective hydrocarbons (ethene, propylene or wax). However, traditional FTS iron-based catalysts produce a large amount of methane and gaseous alkanes, which are useless for the utilization of coal or natural gas resources. Therefore, it is expected that more effective hydrocarbons are produced via selectivity control, addition of promoters or some other feasible ways. It is well known that the promotion of potassium has significant effect on the FTS performance of catalysts [4–7]. That is, potassium suppresses the production of methane and improves the effective hydrocarbon selectivity. Dry and Oosthuizen [8] studied the correlation between catalysts surface basicity and hydrocarbon selectivity, and found that the surface basicity can apparently suppress the methane selectivity. Alkali potassium can bring high surface basicity to the catalysts, but the acidic sites of structural promoter suppress surface basicity. Bukur et al. [9] studied the effect of potassium on the silica-supported iron catalysts and found that silica can suppress the basicity of the K promoter. Dlamini et al. [10] studied the effect of adding SiO2 to a precipitated-iron catalyst using scanning electron microscopy analyses and found that the amount of effective K2O associated with Fe is less when SiO2 added as a binder. In Yong et al.'s study [11], a potassium-containing catalyst without SiO2 addition possesses a markedly higher activity than the catalysts containing SiO2. The decreased activity with addition of SiO2 was attributed by authors to the decrease of the effective potassium due to the interaction between potassium and silica. More recently, Zhang et al. [1] observed a much more complex interaction between metal components (Fe, Cu, K) and SiO2, which had an apparent effect on the surface properties and FTS performance of catalysts. Similarly, this kind of interaction between potassium and structural promoters was observed in other supported catalysts. For example, an interaction between potassium and alumina exists in alumina-supported catalysts. Many researchers postulated that the interaction is in a phase of KAlO2, and Kotarba [12] studied the role of KAlO2 phase and the chemical state of potassium in iron catalysts using model compounds (KAlO2 and KFeO2) and found that potassium at the surface of catalyst is ionic on KAlO2 and covalent on KFeO2. Jun et al. [13] investigated three iron catalysts with different supports (without support, alumina-supported and silica-supported) for FTS reaction. Their results indicated that Al2O3 can dilute and SiO2 can severely dilute the potassium promotion using temperature-programmed decarburization, whereas Al2O3 can help the dispersion of K on Fe-alumina catalyst and SiO2 makes the K and Fe dispersion worse. Ma et al. [14] studied potassium effects on activated-carbon-supported iron catalysts and this report also indicates that the AC-supported iron catalysts need more of potassium promoter to increase catalyst activity relative to the precipitated-iron catalyst due to the dispersion effect of AC support. A lot of literature had proved that an interaction between potassium and structural promoters exists in iron-based FTS catalysts. However, little work was conducted to purposefully study the effect of this interaction on the FTS performance. The present work focuses on the interaction between potassium and some structural promoters, and its effect on FTS performances (carburization behavior, activity, stability, and selectivity) of an iron-based catalyst. The structural promoters (SiO2, Al2O3, and ZSM-5) with different intrinsic acidities were used to counteract the surface basicity of potassium promoter and to provide different K–structural promoter interactions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation The FeMn–SiO2 precursor used in present study was prepared by a combination method of continuous co-precipitation and spray-drying technology, detailed making method is described in literature [1]. Then potassium promoter with Fe/K mole ratio of 100/3 was added to the precursor using the method of mechanically mixed with the different compounds of potassium: K–ZSM-5, K–SiO2 and K–Al2O3. These catalysts were signed as Fe/K-free, Fe/K–ZSM-5, Fe/K–SiO2, and Fe/K–Al2O3 separately, and the detailed description of catalysts is presented in Table 1 . 2.2 Reactor system and operation procedure The experiments were conducted in a 12mm i.d. stainless steel fixed bed reactor with an effective bed length of approximately 15cm (15cm3 bed volume). For all the experiments, approximately 3g catalysts (20–40 mesh) were filled in the reactor, the remaining volume of reactor was filled with quartz granules with the diameter of 10–20 and 20–40 mesh. All the catalysts were reduced with syngas (H2/CO=2.0) at 280°C, 0.5MPa, and 1000h−1 for 16h, then the reactor was cooled down to 160°C. Then the pressure of the system was set to 1.50MPa, and the temperature was gradually increased to 250°C by 10°C/h. The time on steam of all catalysts is about 120h. The product in the hot and cold traps were collected over 24h, weighted and sampled for analysis. During every mass balance period, the tail gas was analyzed twice. 2.3 Catalysts characterization Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to measure the rate of carburization of different K-promoted catalysts. Catalysts (80mg) were loaded into a quartz tube reactor and first heated to 500°C and kept for 30min, and then cooled to ambient temperature in Helium gas. The flow was then switched to 5%CO/95%He and the reaction temperature was increased to 1000°C at rate of 10°C/min. The consumption of reactant gas was monitored by mass spectroscopy. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D-5000 Siemens diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å). The Mössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES) was used to test the structure of the catalysts after reduction and reaction, which measured with a CANBERRA Series 40 MCA constant-acceleration Mössbauer spectrometer (CANBERRA, USA) at room temperature, using a 25m Ci57Co in Pd matrix. 3 Results 3.1 CO-TPR Fig. 1 is CO-TPR profiles of all catalysts. It can be seen that Fe/K-free, Fe/K–ZSM-5 and Fe/K–Al2O3 catalysts all have three reduction/carburization peaks and Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst has two peaks. The first peak is in the temperature range of 200–300°C which is ascribed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. The second peak located in 400–550°C is corresponding to the carburization of iron oxides, and the peak after 600°C is corresponding to the carburization of the difficultly reduced iron oxide phase. The addition of potassium has a marked effect on these carburization peaks. That is, all states of potassium promoters move the reduction/carburization peaks to lower temperature and strengthen the peak intensity in different extents. Specifically, the addition of K–ZSM-5 is less promotional on the carburization, which only slightly lowers the reduction temperature of the peaks and weakens the intensity of the high-temperature peak. In contrast, the addition of K–SiO2 and K–Al2O3 has much more apparent effects on the carburization. That is, the temperatures of the first and second peaks are lower 20 and 100°C, respectively, for Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst than for Fe/K-free catalyst. And, those for Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst are lower 10 and 90°C than for Fe/K-free catalyst. At the same time, K–SiO2 eliminates the third peak at 600°C. K–Al2O3 also eliminates the peak at 600°C, whereas it causes another carburization peak at 650°C. These results indicate that the addition of potassium promoters can restrain carburization of catalysts at high temperature, and make the catalyst carburize completely at lower temperature. 3.2 Catalyst samples after FTS reaction The XRD patterns and MES spectra of the catalysts after reaction are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , and the MES parameters are presented in Table 2 . Fig. 4 shows the content of phase composition of the catalysts after reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, the XRD patterns of all catalysts show two diffraction peaks below 25°, a broad diffraction peak at 36°, two weak peaks at 39° and 40° and a more prominent peak at 43°. According to JCPDS database, the two peaks below 25° correspond to the solid wax, which are not discussed here. The broad peak at 36° is ascribed to the iron oxide phase. The peaks at 39°, 40° and 43° correspond to the iron carbide phase. The diffraction intensity of iron carbides increases in the orders: Fe/K-free<Fe/K–ZSM-5<Fe/K–SiO2 <Fe/K–Al2O3. The XRD patterns show the existence of iron carbides in catalysts after reaction, whereas it is difficult to distinguish the type of iron carbides due to the weak diffraction signal. However, the Mössbauer spectra can provide the type of iron phase and composition. From Fig. 3, the MES spectra of the potassium-promoted catalysts after reaction contain several sets of sextets and doublets. The sextets with Hhf of 184±3kOe, 222±3kOe and 110±6kOe can be attributed to the Hägg carbide, χ-Fe5C2 [15]. The spectral parameters of two doublets can be attributed to the trivalent and bivalent iron oxides in superparamagnetic state in small crystallites, respectively [4]. Table 2 shows the accurate content of every iron phase. For Fe/K-free, Fe/K–ZSM-5 and Fe/K–SiO2, Fe3+ take the most part of the compositions, which content are more than 50%. But for Fe/K–Al2O3, Fe3+ is less than 25% and χ-Fe5C2 take the most part of the compositions, which has the content of 64.3%. Fig. 4 shows the variation of each phase composition. The content of carbide in four catalysts show the following sequence: Fe/K-free<Fe/K–ZSM-5<Fe/K–SiO2 <Fe/K–Al2O3, which is constant with the XRD results. These results indicate that potassium promoter can facilitate the formation of iron carbide in FTS reaction. And moreover, K–ZSM-5 is less promotional, whereas K–Al2O3 is most effective for the formation of iron carbide. 3.3 Catalytic activity and stability The carbon monoxide and hydrogen conversions with time on stream for catalysts were shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the addition of potassium promoters can markedly increase the CO conversion. Comparison of the CO conversion results, the Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst shows the highest FTS activity, next is the Fe/K–ZSM-5, and the K–SiO2 is less promotional on catalytic activity. During the reaction for about 120h, CO conversion of Fe/K-free catalyst increases slightly with time on stream, whereas those of potassium-promoted catalysts declines to some extent. In detail, CO conversions decline on an even keel from 56% to 54%, 51% to 46%, and 60% to 55% for Fe/K–ZSM-5, Fe/K–SiO2 and Fe/K–Al2O3, respectively. In addition, Fe/K–SiO2 has the lowest CO conversion in all the potassium-promoted catalysts which is possibly due to the presence of acidic sites on silica that offset the electron donating potential of potassium [16]. For the H2 conversion in Fig. 6, the unpromoted catalyst has the lowest conversion and potassium promotion leads to different high H2 conversions with different potassium states. For the stability of H2 conversion, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst keeps unchanged basically during the reaction time, whereas those of Fe/K–SiO2 and Fe/K–Al2O3 catalysts reduce gradually from 38% to 28% and 34% to 31%. Potassium combined with different acidic structural promoters all bring higher H2 consumption rate than Fe/K-free catalyst, which is maybe due to the acidic sites of the structural promoters helping the activation and adsorption of H2 in the surface of catalysts, and offering H atoms to FTS catalytic active sites. During the reaction, CO and H2 conversions all lose their activities to some degree, which are 1.0%/day and 1.9%/day for Fe/K–SiO2, 0.4%/day and 0.1%/day for Fe/K–ZSM-5, and 1.0%/day and 0.6%/day for Fe/K–Al2O3, respectively. But for Fe/K-free catalyst, it is an opposite tendency. Besides, it was also found that the loss of activity from the point of view of CO conversion is smaller than that of H2 for Fe/K–SiO2, but the different things happen to the other potassium-promoted catalysts. The results indicate that the different potassium-promoted catalysts may have the different mechanisms in activity loss, and the reason needs a further research. 3.4 Products selectivity The hydrocarbon selectivities of all catalysts are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the potassium-unpromoted catalyst produces the most gaseous hydrocarbons (C1–C4) and least C5 + products, whereas K promoter restrains the production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons and increases the C5 + selectivity. Quantitatively, the methane selectivity of Fe/K-free is 11.09% and this value decreases with K promoter in orders: K–ZSM-5>K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 (9.13%, 6.37%, 3.82% at 120h, respectively). Correspondingly, the selectivity of C5 + hydrocarbons increase with K promoter in orders: K-free<K–ZSM-5<K–Al2O3 <K–SiO2 (63.66%, 67.97%, 75.48%, and 81.48%, respectively). The ratios of olefin to paraffin (measured in C2–4 =/C2–4°), and liquid and solid hydrocarbon selectivity for all catalysts at 120h are also listed in Table 3. The values of C2–4 =/C2–4° show an apparent increase with promotion of potassium in orders: K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 >K–ZSM-5. Interestingly, although Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst produces comparable light hydrocarbons to Fe/K-free catalyst, it also yields the most liquid hydrocarbons in all catalysts. Fig. 7 also shows the product stability with time on stream. At whole reaction period, Fe/K-free catalyst keeps the methane selectivity at about 10% and C5 + hydrocarbons selectivity at about 67%, whereas the hydrocarbon selectivity of K-promoted catalysts varies with time increasing. That is, the methane selectivity of Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst decreases and C5 + selectivity increases with time increasing. However, for Fe/K–Al2O3 and Fe/K–SiO2 catalysts, the thing is different that methane selectivity increases and C5 + decreases with time increasing. The suppressive effect of K promoter on light hydrocarbon and paraffin selectivity is consistent with previous potassium pertinent literature [9,17–21]. Potassium has been reported to enhance CO adsorption but to suppress H2 adsorption on the iron surface. Hence, changes surface concentrations of C, H species, improves the probability of continued chain growth and the formation of much high molecular-weight hydrocarbons, and inhibits the hydrogenation reaction and the light hydrocarbons and alkanes production. 4 Discussion It is well known that potassium is used as a chemical promoter in iron-based FTS catalysts. Since potassium is assumed to donate electron to the vacant d orbital of the transition metal as evidenced by the lowering of the metal work function [22], its presence would enhance the dissociation adsorption of CO, while deteriorating the H2 adsorption [7,22,23]. Therefore, facilitating the reduction of catalysts in CO [7,18,24], and making carburizing process easier at low temperature as seen in Fig. 1. These results are in good agreement with previous studies of potassium-promoted iron catalysts [4,23]. Previous studies [4,23] also revealed that there is a K-support interaction in catalysts, which decreases the promotional effect of potassium on FTS activity and selectivity. The results in this study indicate that the structural promoters absolutely affect the promotional effect of potassium. From the carburization point of view, the potassium combined with Al2O3 is more effective while K–ZSM-5 is less. From CO conversion view, K–Al2O3 is also more effective while K–SiO2 is less. From H2 conversion view, K–ZSM-5 is more effective while K–Al2O3 is less at the beginning of reaction and K–SiO2 at the end of reaction. From hydrocarbon selectivity view, K–SiO2 is more effective while K–ZSM-5 is less. The different effects of potassium with different structural promoters on carburization, activity and selectivity of catalysts indicate a complex interaction between potassium and structural promoters. On one hand, basic potassium can interact with the acid sites on structural promoters or is fixed in pores or holes of structural promoters. It is widely proved that SiO2 does not contain acid sites of either the Brønsted or Lewis type [25–29]. Al2O3 contains only Lewis acid sites [29,30] while silica–alumina complex or zeolites (ZSM-5) contain both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites [29–32]. Thereby, these acid sites on structural promoters would decrease or inhibit the promotional effect of potassium. Although silica does not contain any acid sites, it was added as potassium water glass, potassium interacts strongly with silica. Dry and Oosthuizen [8] also reported that acidic oxides as supports may react with basic alkali and thereby reduce the promotional effect of potassium. McVicker and Vannice [33] reported that a high surface area support tends to reduce the direct contact between iron and potassium, which also renders the potassium promotion less effective. Bukur et al. [9] reported a hydrocarbon selectivity improvement with the addition of support and the results were interpreted in terms of interactions between potassium and/or iron with supports. Jun et al. [13] compared SiO2 and Al2O3 as binders for FTS catalysts and found that the promotion of potassium on the alumina-supported catalyst is much more effective than that on the silica-supported catalyst. That is, a deeper carburization, higher catalytic activity, and lower methane selectivity was observed on alumina-supported catalyst than on silica-supported catalyst. The author thought that alumina has a better dispersion than silica, resulting in a good Fe–K interaction on alumina-supported catalyst and a poor Fe–K interaction on silica-supported catalyst. The results in our study are generally consistent with Jun's results. However, the addition of silica and alumina in this study is via a physical mixture, which is totally different from Jun's preparation method. The physical mixture leads to a poor interaction between iron and structural promoters (silica, alumina, and ZSM-5). In other words, the latter added structural promoters have no contribution on the dispersion of iron and potassium. Therefore, the dispersion effects of structural promoters mentioned by above authors can be withdrawn. Although potassium was added via physically mixing, it apparently varied the catalytic performances of catalysts. The reason is possible due to the migration of potassium on the catalyst surface under FTS reaction conditions. Boes and Böhringer [34] studied the combination of an alkali-promoted iron-based FTS catalyst and an acidic co-catalyst (H–ZSM-5) for syngas conversion to hydrocarbon and found that a physical mixture of the two catalysts resulted in severe alkali migration from the iron catalyst to the zeolite. Similarly, our results indicate that the alkali potassium can easily migrate from the surface or structure of structural promoters (SiO2, Al2O3 and ZSM-5) to the iron surface. At the same time, the different promotional effects of potassium depending on structural promoters indicate that the structural promoters can inhibit the migration of potassium to some extents. From above literature and results, it is clear that ZSM-5 has the strongest inhibiting effect on the motility of potassium while Al2O3 is much weaker. Therefore, the amount of effective potassium provided by these potassium-structure-complex promoters is decreased in orders: K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 >K–ZSM-5, which can well explain the effects of these K-complexes on the carburization of catalysts. On the other hand, the surface diffusion of reactants and intermediates (called spillover) between the metal sites and the supports or structural promoters can apparently enhance the catalytic activity and vary the selectivity [35,36]. Lots of literature reported a spillover phenomenon of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon monoxide from Pt, Ni, Co, Ru and Rh sites to Al2O3 or Zeolite surfaces [37–40] while no such phenomenon was observed on SiO2 surface [37]. Sen et al. [37,38] studied the CO hydrogenation with physically mixed catalysts of Ni/SiO2 with Al2O3 or Ni/Al2O3 with Al2O3 and observed a H–CO complex spillover onto Al2O3 surface. Especially for the Al2O3–Ni/SiO2 mixture, only one CH4 site was seen during CO temperature-programmed reaction on Ni/SiO2 catalysts, but it occurred on Al2O3–Ni/SiO2 mixtures. Zhang et al. [35] studied the hydrogen spillover phenomenon over Pt/H–ZSM-5 catalysts and revealed the occurrence of hydrogen spillover from Pt sites to zeolite acid sites, where hydrogenated the strongly adsorbed pyridine. From above literature and combined with results in this paper, it is postulated that the spillover phenomenon occurs on the Fe-hybrid catalysts (on the physical mixtures of Fe/K–Al2O3 and Fe/K–ZSM-5, not on Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst). On the Fe/K–Al2O3 and Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalysts, the CO and H species adsorbed on Fe sites transfer to Al2O3 and ZSM-5 surfaces, where the CO species hydrogenates to CH4 and H2O. On the basis of spillover, the enhanced CO and H2 conversions and the increased CH4 selectivity can be well explained. That is, ZSM-5 maybe has the strongest hydrogenation capability for the spilt-over species, which can improve the conversions of CO and H2. At the same time, K–ZSM-5 provides the least effective potassium on catalyst surface. The two factors lead to Fe/K–ZSM-5 producing the highest CH4 selectivity and the highest H2 conversion in three potassium-promoted catalysts. The Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst contains the most effective potassium and possesses of certain hydrogenation capability, which lead to the highest CO conversion, but medium CH4 selectivity. For Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst, it has a medium effective potassium amount, but no spillover phenomenon and no excessive CH4 formation sites on SiO2 surface. Therefore, Fe/K–SiO2 produces the lowest CH4 products. 5 Conclusion Iron-based catalysts promoted with potassium combined with different structural promoters have different effects on catalytic performances. The effect of different potassium promoters on carburization of catalysts is in sequence of K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 >K–ZSM-5>K-free, according to CO-TPR, XRD and MES. It is because of the different acidic sites on structural promoters and the interaction of potassium and structural promoters. Due to the spillover between the metal sites and the supports or structural promoters, and the least effective potassium on catalyst surface, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst has highest H2 conversion and CH4 selectivity. The Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst produces the highest CO conversion and medium CH4 selectivity because of the most effective potassium and certain spillover-hydrogenation capability on Al2O3 surface. Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst has a medium effective potassium amount, but no spillover phenomenon and no excessive CH4 formation sites on SiO2 surface, which explain the lowest methane and the highest C5 + selectivities on the catalyst.

Characterization technologies of temperature-programmed reduction with CO (CO-TPR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES) were used to study the effect of K–structural promoter interactions on the carburization behaviors of catalysts. It showed that the addition states of potassium (K–Al2O3, K–SiO2, K–ZSM-5 and K-free) have a significant influence on the formation of iron carbides, which shows a following sequence in promotion of carburization: K–Al2O3 >K–SiO2 >K–ZSM-5>K-free. The FTS reaction test was performed in a fixed bed reactor. It is found that Fe/K–Al2O3 catalyst leads to the highest CO conversion, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest H2 conversion, and Fe/K-free catalyst shows the lowest CO and H2 conversion. As for the hydrocarbon selectivity, Fe/K–SiO2 catalyst yields the lowest methane and the highest C5 + products, Fe/K–ZSM-5 catalyst yields higher methane and the highest liquid hydrocarbon product, whereas Fe/K-free catalyst yields the highest methane and the lowest C5 + products. These results can be explained from the interaction between potassium and structure promoters, and the spillover of reactants or intermediates from Fe sites to the surfaces of structural promoters.",
