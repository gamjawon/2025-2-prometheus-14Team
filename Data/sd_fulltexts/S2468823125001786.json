The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide (CO) to high-value multicarbon chemicals represents an effective strategy for achieving a sustainable carbon cycle. In recent years, researchers have developed a variety of highly efficient catalysts for the reduction of CO. Among these materials, non-metallic catalysts demonstrate considerable energy application due to their environmentally friendly, low-cost and compositionally tunable properties. In this study, we innovatively designed a non-metallic catalyst (B/g-C3N4/GN) by introducing boron (B) atoms to the heterostructure of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and graphene (GN) to reduce CO through first-principle calculations. The catalyst effectively promotes the conversion of CO to ethylene (CH2CH2) with a free energy increase of 0.22 eV for the potential-determining step (PDS), and the energy barrier for C–C coupling is only 0.37 eV, which demonstrates the efficient and stable catalytic performance. The design of the B/g-C3N4/GN material provides a new approach in the field of electrocatalysis.

The combustion of fossil fuels results in the emission of considerable quantities of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), which serves to intensify the greenhouse effect [3]. Furthermore, fossil fuels have limited reserves and are non-renewable [4]. The conversion of CO2 into fuels and high-value chemicals has been regarded as a promising solution to address the increasingly serious issues of the greenhouse effect and energy crisis [5–8]. The CO2 can be converted by a number of different processes, including thermal, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes [9–12]. Among these methods, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 has the advantages of mild reaction conditions and adjustable reduction products, and it has received increasing attention [13,14]. In electrocatalytic reduction reactions, various metal-containing materials [7,15–20] have been identified as excellent electrocatalytic candidates for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to convert CO2/carbon monoxide (CO) into valuable chemicals and fuels. Meanwhile, non-metallic catalysts have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent chemical stability, environmental friendliness, and their low cost [21–24]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) exhibits a promising energy application as a metal-free catalyst or carrier [25–27]. In general, g-C₃N₄ is employed as a metal-free photocatalyst in various reactions, mainly including photocatalytic water splitting [28], the photoreduction of CO2 to CO [29,30], the photoreduction of N₂ to NH₃ [31]. However, g-C3N4 faces many challenges as an electrocatalytic material. Firstly, g-C3N4 is the semiconductor material with low electrical conductivity [32]. Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO on g-C3N4 is relatively low [33], which prevents the generation of the key intermediate *CO in the reduction of carbon dioxide to multi-carbon products. In the pursuit of high-performance CO₂ (or CO) reduction electrocatalysts, the electrical conductivity and CO adsorption issues encountered by g-C₃N₄ have become the principal constraints impeding its advancement. In order to overcome these limitations, researchers have engaged in an ongoing process of exploring new solutions. The strategies of constructing heterojunctions and heteroatom doping have been proven to have considerable energy [34,35]. In recent years, graphene (GN) has been extensively studied as a promising electrocatalyst due to its good chemical stability and excellently electrical conductivity [36]. This material has been identified as a prospective candidate material for electrocatalysis. Studies have shown that layered GN/g-C3N4 composites exhibit high electrical conductivity [37]. This improvement can be attributed to the tunable band gap and high carrier mobility of graphene [37]. Furthermore, chemical doping is an effective way to modify the electronic structure and surface properties of semiconductors [38]. Relevant studies have demonstrated that the performance of catalysts in the electrochemical conversion of CO can be significantly enhanced by introducing atomically dispersed boron (B) atoms into the catalyst substrate [23,39]. The sp3 hybridization B atoms contain both occupied orbitals and empty orbitals [23], which can facilitate the transfer of electrons from the occupied sp3 hybrid orbitals to the 2π* orbitals of CO. Thereby, the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for CO molecule is enhanced. Furthermore, the catalyst can accept electrons from the 5σ orbitals of CO molecule, which can reduce the bonding energy between C and O and facilitate subsequent hydrogenation process. In the previous study, we have successfully designed a new electrocatalyst, which exhibits a promising capacity to catalyze the reduction of CO to ethylene (CH2CH2) [40]. Moreover, the efficacy of the B(C6H5)3-KH2PO4 pair in catalyzing the reduction of CO2 to formate has been assessed [41]. In this study, a novel material (B/g-C3N4/GN) was designed by constructing heterojunctions and doping B atoms. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the adsorption capacity of the B/g-C3N4/GN material for CO molecules and to discuss three possible patterns for the formation of C–C bonds. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic performance of CO reduction to CH2CH2 was evaluated and the optimal pathway for CH2CH2 generation was determined. Finally, the free energy barriers of the potential-determining steps (PDSs) of CO reduction to C1 (methanol and methane) and C2 (CH2CH2) chemicals were compared, demonstrating that B/g-C3N4/GN exhibits a remarkable selectivity for the C2 product. The findings of this study offer a novel approach to design metal-free electrocatalytic materials and provide insights for the future development of metal-free CO reduction reaction (CORR) electrocatalysts. 2 Calculation details All the spin-polarized DFT calculations were implemented with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [42]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [43] functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed to describe the exchange-correlation interaction. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) [44] was used to describe the ion-electron interactions. The plane wave energy cutoff was set to 500 eV, and the convergence criterion for the energy and force of all structures was set to 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The B/g-C3N4/GN catalyst was constructed by introducing a B atom into a 2 × 2 × 1 g-C3N4 and graphene bonded double layer supercells. All geometric optimizations were performed in the Brillouin zone using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid sampling. A 20 Å vacuum layer was constructed in the z direction to avoid the interaction between the layer and the image due to periodic boundary conditions. The DFT-D3(BJ) method for van der Waals (vdW) correction was employed [45]. The hybrid functional of the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) method was employed to calculate the energy band structure of the materials [46]. The Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble with a time step of 8 ps. The temperature was set to 500 K using the Nose-Hoover method [47]. A transition-state search was conducted utilizing the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [48]. The interactions for C–C bonds were revealed using the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) [49,50]. The variation of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for each elementary step was calculated as follow [23,51]: Δ G = Δ E + Δ E Z P E − T Δ S + Δ G U + Δ G p H where ∆E, ∆EZPE and ∆S represent the different values of total energy, zero-point vibrational energy, and entropy, respectively. The T is the room temperature (298.15 K), ∆EZPE and ∆S can be derived from the vibrational frequencies under the harmonic approximations with negligible contributions from the substrate. The ∆GU can be obtained by ∆GU = -neU, where n and U are the number of transferred electrons and the applied electrode energy, respectively. The ∆GpH is the free energy correction of pH, and the pH is considered to be zero. To measure the stability of B/g-C3N4/GN, the formation energy (Ef) was calculated using the formula [52]: E f = E B / g − C 3 N 4 / GN − E B − E g − C 3 N 4 / GN where EB/g-C 3 N 4 /GN, Eg-C 3 N 4 /GN, and EB are the total energy of B/g-C3N4/GN, pure g-C3N4/GN, and the B atom (Table S1) in the most stable bulk structure, respectively. The limiting voltage (UL) was calculated as: U L = − Δ G max / | e | where ∆Gmax represents the maximum value of the Gibbs free energy change among the various reactions under consideration. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structures and stability of B/g-C3N4/GN The heterostructures of g-C3N4 and GN have been reported to facilitate electron transfer at the interface [53]. And related studies have demonstrated that B-doped graphene/g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibits superior catalytic activity for photocatalytic CO reduction [54]. The introduction of B atoms in the heterostructure can affect the charge density of the surrounding C atoms. Based on the concept of electron “acceptance-donation”, the B atom can also be decorated on the g-C3N4, enhancing the electron transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic activity [55,56]. Therefore, we constructed a B-doped g-C3N4/GN (B/g-C3N4/GN) heterostructure (Fig. 1 a) and investigated the catalytic activity of the electrocatalytic CO reduction by DFT calculations. A prerequisite for high-performance catalysts is the possession of excellent electrical conductivity [20]. Based on this, we calculated the electronic band structure of B/g-C3N4/GN. As shown in Fig. S1, the valence band maxima at M point is higher than the conduction band minimum at Γ point, indicating that B/g-C3N4/GN is semi-metallic. The studied material in this work has good electrical conductivity. In addition, the Ef of the doped B atom was calculated for the evaluation of the agglomeration effect of the metal-free catalyst. The Ef of single B atom doped on g-C3N4/GN material is 1.52 eV, which is lower than the value of B-doped monolayer g-C3N4 system reported by Wei et al. [57]. In addition, the stability of B/g-C3N4/GN was further verified by performing AIMD simulations at 500 K. As shown in Fig. S2, the temperature and energy of the B/g-C3N4/GN oscillate around the equilibrium state during whole AIMD simulations. Meanwhile, the geometric structure of B/g-C3N4/GN only shows slight vibrations with time evolution, indicating that the heterostructure has high stability. To gain deeper insights into the characteristics of the B/g-C3N4/GN material, electron localization function [58,59] (ELF) and differential charge density analyses were investigated. Generally, a higher ELF value indicates stronger local electron distribution [60]. As shown in Fig. 1b, the ELF values are approximately 0.8 between B–N, suggesting that the central B atom is chemisorbed bonded with surrounding N atoms. Additionally, the red-marked region indicates the presence of a high-density unpaired electron cloud surrounding the B atom, which can be used as an active site for CO adsorption. The Fig. 1c exhibits the charge redistribution phenomenon between the B–N bonds, which favors the formation of stable chemical bond. To provide further verification, the Bader charges were also calculated (Table S2). The data shows that the B atom loses electrons, with some of them being transferred to the B–N bond, which is in consistent with the result of differential charge density analysis. In conclusion, B/g-C3N4/GN materials exhibit favorable stability and the energy catalytic activity, having the energy to be the catalyst for CORR. 3.2 The catalytic activity of B/g-C3N4/GN for CO reduction The adsorption and activation of CO molecule on the active sites of B/g-C3N4/GN are initially considered, which are crucial for achieving an effective reduction of multi-carbon products. The most stable adsorption configuration is shown in Fig. 2 a, where the C atom is preferentially adsorbed on the active site of B atom. The B–C bond length is 1.47 Å, which is shorter than the one (1.63 Å) of bulk boron carbide (B4C) [61] and similar with the result of 1.51 Å for B-doped black phosphorene [39]. In addition, the C–O bond length is 1.17 Å, which is longer than that of an isolated CO molecule (1.14 Å), indicating that the CO molecule is activated on the surface of B/g-C3N4/GN. Furthermore, the charge transfer phenomenon between the CO molecule and the catalyst were analyzed. In Fig. 2b, the charge transfer can be observed between the CO molecule and the catalyst, with 0.60 electrons transferred from B to C atoms. The above analyses indicate that the material has excellent CO adsorption and activation capabilities to CO. The C–C coupling process plays a pivotal role in the generation of C2 products. Former studies have indicated that CO may be coupled with *CO, *HCO, *CH2, etc. [21,62], to obtain C–C bond coupling, which triggers the CORR to produce C2 chemicals. In recent years, scientific research has revealed frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) not only possess effective activation of many small molecules [63,64] but also promote the coupling process of C–C bonds [65,66]. Generally, B atoms possess empty orbitals, acting as Lewis acids, while N atoms are electron-rich, functioning as Lewis bases. The FLPs, composed of these Lewis acids and bases, are known to effectively capture CO molecules [65]. Notably, this catalyst incorporates two potential Lewis base N sites (labeled as N_1 and N_2 in Fig. 2c), with N_1 and N_2 atoms situated at moderate distances from the B atom (3.73 Å and 2.77 Å, respectively), which can effectively prevent the quenching of electron donors and acceptors [40]. The Bader charge analyses of B and N atoms were employed, as shown in Table S2. It is inferred that the B and N atoms could form the frustrated Lewis pairs. Through electronic energy calculations, we compare the stability of intermediates formed after C–C coupling at these two sites. The results reveal that the energies of *COCO, *HCOCO, and *CH2CO intermediates at the N_2 site are markedly lower than those at the N_1 site (Table S3). This suggests that the B–N_2 combination favors the formation of intra-molecular B–N FLPs, wherein the B site efficiently captures the CO molecule and the N site promotes the C–C coupling of another CO molecule with the formed intermediate to the reduction of CO to C2 chemicals. To further elucidate the coupling mechanisms at the B–N_2 active center, three possible C1 precursors, namely, *CO, *HCO, and *CH2, are employed to delve into the coupling processes. As shown in Fig. 3 a-c, three coupling processes are exothermic. A comparison of the energy barriers of the three coupling processes shows that the *CH2–CO coupling process has the lowest energy barrier (0.37 eV), indicating that it is kinetically more favourable. To further elucidate this difference, we analyzed the COHP for the interaction of the C∙∙∙C bond in the transition state (TS). As shown in Fig. 3d-f, the bonding contributions (below the Fermi energy level) of *CH2∙∙∙CO are much larger than those of *CO∙∙∙CO and *HCO∙∙∙CO. The integrated values of COHP (ICOHP) were used to quantitatively explore the bonding strength of C∙∙∙C bond. The ICOHP of *CH2∙∙∙CO, *CO∙∙∙CO and *HCO∙∙∙CO are -2.14, -0.99 and -0.94, respectively. More negative ICOHP indicates the stronger interaction of *CH2∙∙∙CO bond. Consequently, the COHP analysis indicates that *CH2–CO has the most stable TS, which results in the lowest energy barrier for C–C coupling. In addition, we calculated the charge density difference of *CH2CO as shown in Fig. 4 . The results indicate that an electron transfer occurs between two coupled C atoms, which facilitates the formation and stabilization of C–C bonds. The reaction pathways for the *CH2–CO coupling to produce CH2CH2 and the corresponding structures of the reaction intermediates are presented in Fig. 5 . The first step in the pathway is the adsorption of a single CO molecule onto the B site to form *CO, which subsequently undergoes a series of transformations to form *HCO, *H2CO, *H2COH, *CH2, *CH2CO, *CH2CHO, *CH2CHOH, *CH2CH, *CH2CH2, and CH2CH2(g). In this pathway, the first dehydration step occurs in the fourth hydrogenation process (*H2COH → *CH2). In contrast, the further hydrogenation of *H2COH to form *CH3OH has a higher free energy barrier (1.89 eV) compared to forming *CH2 (Fig. S3). As discussed earlier, *CH2 is more inclined to couple with another CO molecule. The *CH2–CO presents the lower energy barrier (0.37 eV), resulting in the *CH2CO intermediate adsorbed on the B–N_2 active center. The subsequent hydrogenation of *CH2CO produces the *CH2CHO intermediate with a ∆G of -0.01 eV. Another product of the *CH2CO hydrogenation process is *CH2COH, but the energy barrier for this process is 1.15 eV (Fig. 5a). This difference indicates a higher feasibility of producing *CH2CHO. Further hydrogenation of *CH2CHO produces *CH2CHOH (∆G = 0.20 eV). Three energy routes for the hydrogenation of *CH2CHOH are feasible: hydrogenation of *CH2CHOH to form *CH3CHOH or *CH2CH2OH, or dehydration to form *CH2CH. This is the key step in determining the selectivity between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and CH2CH2 formation. As shown in Fig. S4, the hydrogenation of *CH2CHOH to form *CH3CHOH and *CH2CH is endothermic, whereas the hydrogenation of *CH2CHOH to form *CH2CH2OH is exothermic (the corresponding reaction intermediates are shown in Fig. S5). The barrier for the formation of *CH3CHOH from *CH2CHOH (1.92 eV) is significantly higher than the formation of *CH2CH (0.22 eV). Additionally, the hydrogenation of *CH2CHOH to *CH2CH2OH results in the decrease in free energy of 0.39 eV. The *CH2CH2OH serves as one crucial intermediate in the formation of both *CH3CH2OH and *CH2CH2, with barriers of 1.90 eV and 0.37 eV, respectively. The ∆G for the formation of *CH2CH from *CH2CHOH is 0.22 eV, indicating that the energy barrier for *CH2CHOH → *CH2CH → *CH2CH2 is lower than that for *CH2CHOH → *CH2CH2OH → *CH2CH2. For the overall reduction of CO to CH2CH2, the PDS is the one to form the *CH2CH species. The maximum ∆G value is 0.22 eV (corresponding UL of -0.22 V). The free energy changes during the hydrogenation process of *CH2CH2 are investigated (Fig. S6). In particular, the transformation of *CH2CH2 to *CH2CH3 has the ∆G of -0.84 eV, while the barrier for transformation to *CH3CH2 is 2.38 eV. In the subsequent hydrogenation process, the transformation of *CH2CH3 to the intermediate *CH3CH3 has the barrier of 1.94 eV. Consequently, the energy barrier required for ethane (CH3CH3) formation is significantly higher than that required for CH2CH2 synthesis, indicating that the catalyst has a higher selectivity towards CH2CH2. The Gibbs free energy decreases by a total of 3.21 eV from the beginning to the end of the hydrogenation of *CO, which is much higher than the energy cost (2.04 eV) required for the formation of gaseous CH2CH2. This suggests that the desorption of CH2CH2 end products from B/g-C3N4/GN is an energetically feasible process. The mechanism starts from *HCOCO and *COCO intermediates, generated by *HCO–CO and *CO–CO coupling processes, are also investigated. The free energy diagrams and corresponding reaction intermediates are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S5. The PDS for the *HCO−CO coupling pathway is the formation of *HCOHCO with 0.28 eV uphill free energy change. There are two kinds of hydrogenation products of *HCOCO (Fig. 6a). The formation of *HCOHCO (0.28 eV) is easier than the formation of *HCOCOH (0.78 eV). Following dehydration, *HCOHCO transforms into *CHCO with the ΔG of −1.22 eV, while the formation of the *HCOHCOH intermediate requires overcoming an energy barrier of 0.89 eV. The process of further hydrogenation of *CHCO produces *CH2CO and eventually produces CH2CH2. For the *CO–CO coupling pathway, the PDS is the same as that previously discussed for *CH2–CO coupling, which is the formation of *CH2CHO. The first step in this pathway involves the direct coupling of two CO molecules to form the *COCO intermediate, with the coupling energy barrier higher than that of *H2C–CO coupling. The first step of dehydration in the *CO–CO coupling pathway occurs in the process of *COHCO → *CCO (Fig. 6b). In this process, the free energy change of the dehydration process is downhill while the formation of *COHCOH shows an uphill free energy change. Continued hydrogenation of *CCO produces *CH2CO intermediates, and the hydrogenation process after the formation of the *CH2CO intermediate is the same as that of the *CH2–CO coupling process. In Fig. S7, we present the specific and most favorable reaction pathways for the formation of CH2CH2 through three different coupling methods on the B–N_2 active center. The formation of C2 products tends to choose the pathway with lower energy barriers and lower limiting energys. Consequently, the *CH2–CO coupling pathway is the preferred route for CH2CH2 production. 3.3 Catalytic selectivity of CO reduction to CH2CH2 The preceding analysis has demonstrated the remarkable catalytic activity of the B/g-C3N4/GN heterojunction for the reduction of CO to CH2CH2. It is also important to note that competing processes exist. For example, individual CO molecule adsorbed on the B/g-C3N4/GN heterojunction may also undergo reduction to form C1 chemical species, including methane (CH4) and methanol (CH3OH). To produce C1 product, CO is reduced to CH4 through a six-electron pathway (CO + 6H+ + 6e- → CH4(g) + H2O), and to CH3OH through a four-electron pathway (CO + 4H+ + 4e- → CH3OH(g)). The Fig. S3 shows the CORR pathways for CH4 and CH3OH on B/g-C3N4/GN and the structures of corresponding reaction intermediates. The initial step of the CORR process involves the conversion of CO(g) to *CO, which is exothermic with the decrease in energy of -2.05 eV. Following the formation of the *CO intermediate, the subsequent hydrogenation of *CO to *COH and *HCO is observed with a corresponding change in Gibbs free energy of +1.89 eV and +0.02 eV, respectively. This indicates that the formation of *COH is more challenging than that of *HCO. The ∆G for the conversion of *HCO → *HCOH and *HCO → *H2CO are 0.19 eV and -0.34 eV, respectively. Therefore, the reduction of *HCO to *H2CO is more favourable. After the formation of the intermediate *H2COH, hydrogen atom can be added to the carbon atom of *H2COH to form *CH3OH with the ∆G value of +1.89 eV. This step represents the PDS in the CH3OH production process. In addition, the introduction of hydrogen atoms can induce dehydration leading to the formation of *CH2. After the formation of the intermediate *CH2, the reaction tends downwards to form *CH3. The *CH3 further hydrogenates *CH4 with a ∆G of +1.99 eV, which is the PDS for the CH4 formation process. The optimal pathway for the reduction of CO to CH3OH on B/g-C3N4/GN is: CO(g) → *CO → *HCO → *H2CO → *H2COH → CH3OH(g), while CORR follows the pathway: CO(g) → *CO → *HCO → *H2CO → *H2COH → *CH2 → *CH3 → *CH4 → CH4(g) for CH4 production. The CORR processes for CH3OH and CH4 production have to overcome significant free energy barriers, therefore the competitive ability of B/g-C3N4/GN in the production of C1 compounds is relatively low. In other words, B/g-C3N4/GN tends to produce C2 compounds. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is recognized as the key competitive process to the CORR, leading to a decline in faradaic efficiency [39]. In practical experiments, adjusting conditions such as electrolyte pH and the electrocatalytic environment can effectively mitigate the impact of the HER and enhance the efficiency of the CO2RR [67–69]. Additionally, we have calculated and compared the limiting energy difference between CORR and HER to evaluate the selectivity of CORR over HER (Fig. S8). Positive values indicate higher selectivity for CORR than HER, with the limiting energy of Cu(211) (−0.65 V) as the benchmark [70]. In comparison, the B and N_2 sites have favorable selectivity for the production of CH2CH2 through CORR. 4 Conclusion In summary, this study investigates the energy of B/g-C3N4/GN heterostructures as metal-free catalysts for the reduction of CO to CH2CH2 through DFT calculation. The B/g-C3N4/GN possesses relatively good adsorption capacity for CO molecule. Comparisons for three pathways of the coupling process reveal that the energy barrier for *CH2–CO coupling on the B/g-C3N4/GN catalyst was least (0.37 eV), indicating that the B–N_2 active center favors C–C coupling. Throughout this coupling process, the free energy for the reduction of CO to CH2CH2 in the potential limiting step increases by 0.22 eV, indicating the better electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, by dissecting the competitive reaction pathways, the high selectivity of B/g-C3N4/GN towards CH2CH2 production has been confirmed. This study identifies the B/g-C3N4/GN as the highly promising metal-free electrocatalyst for reducing CO to CH2CH2, and will also facilitate the development of design strategies to improve the catalytic performance.

        "dc:description": "The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide (CO) to high-value multicarbon chemicals represents an effective strategy for achieving a sustainable carbon cycle. In recent years, researchers have developed a variety of highly efficient catalysts for the reduction of CO. Among these materials, non-metallic catalysts demonstrate considerable energy application due to their environmentally friendly, low-cost and compositionally tunable properties. In this study, we innovatively designed a non-metallic catalyst (B/g-C3N4/GN) by introducing boron (B) atoms to the heterostructure of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and graphene (GN) to reduce CO through first-principle calculations. The catalyst effectively promotes the conversion of CO to ethylene (CH2CH2) with a free energy increase of 0.22 eV for the potential-determining step (PDS), and the energy barrier for C–C coupling is only 0.37 eV, which demonstrates the efficient and stable catalytic performance. The design of the B/g-C3N4/GN material provides a new approach in the field of electrocatalysis.",
