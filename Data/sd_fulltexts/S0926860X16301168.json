Graphical abstract A new combination of co-catalysts and photocatalyst, Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S, is found to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation from water. The presence of dual co-catalysts not only improves the photocatalytic activity but also increases the stability of the CdZnS photocatalyst. Increased visible light absorption and a decrease in bandgap occur for Cd0.5Zn0.5S in the presence of the co-catalysts. All samples exist as nanocrystalline materials with a particle size in the range of 20–50nm. In this system, Ru is in 4+ oxidation state and Pt is in metallic state. Photoluminescence studies suggest the presence of a number of defect levels/surface states in these catalysts, whose energy vary with the composition of the catalyst. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S is attributed to the better separation of photogenerated charge carriers assisted by the dual co-catalysts. Another remarkable property exhibited by this system is the increased stability for repeated use, which can be attributed to the effective transfer of photogenerated holes from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to RuS2, which minimizes the photo corrosion of the catalyst. Photoelectrochemical results show a significant increase in the photocurrent with applied voltage and excellent switching characteristics for both Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.5Zn0.5S. No discernible improvement in photocurrent is seen for Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S compared to Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The difference in the photocatalytic and photo electrochemical property is explained based on the inherent differences of the two phenomena. Keywords Zn doped CdS Pt RuS2 Co-catalyst Hydrogen Photocatalysis 1 Introduction Cadmium sulfide is a potential visible light active photocatalyst suitable for hydrogen generation from water. However, certain limitations like photo-instability and short lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers have to be overcome to improve its photocatalytic activity [1]. To minimize these problems, efforts such as embedding CdS particles into a polymer matrix or layered compounds [2–4], coupling CdS with other wide-band-gap semiconductors [5], and fabricating CdS/oxide heterostructures are done [6–11]. ZnS is another efficient semiconductor photocatalyst, exhibiting high photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation without noble metal co-catalyst because of its high conduction band position [5]. However, ZnS can only utilize ultraviolet light due to its wide band gap (3.6eV). A number of modifications of ZnS have been made to produce visible light response while maintaining the high conduction band of ZnS. Doping of ZnS with different transition metal cations such as Cu, In, Pb, Bi,Ni, Sr [12–17] etc. has been done successfully, which enhances the absorbance of ZnS in the visible-light region. These doped ZnS photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity due to the improved visible light absorption and due to the high conduction band potential of the doped ZnS system. Cd1−xZnxS, which is the solid solution of CdS and ZnS, has attracted lot of attention, due to the controllable band structure and excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation [18–29]. ZnS has a higher conduction band (CB) and a lower valance band (VB) positions compared to CdS, which implies higher activities of electrons and holes localized at CB and VB, respectively. Systematic investigation of the development of highly efficient Cd1−xZnxS is desirable as the photocatalytic activity of this solid solution is still far from the fundamental requirement of practical application. In order to improve the photocatalytic efficiency significantly, development of novel approaches for the modification of the Cd1−xZn x S photocatalyst is required. Though it is possible to improve the optical absorption property of ZnS by varying the concentrations of Zn and Cd in the solid solution, the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is still a problem and has to be tackled to enhance its efficiency. Incorporation of a co-catalyst on semiconductors is an effective approach to promote the charge separation and transfer, inhibit the charge recombination and enhance the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance can be further improved by loading dual co-catalysts for reduction and oxidation, which could lower the activation energy barriers for the two half reactions [30,31]. By using co-catalyst to trap the photogenerated electrons or holes, the photocatalytic activity can be improved significantly. The most often employed co-catalysts are noble metal nanocrystals like Pt, Pd etc. [30–33]. Non-metal co-catalysts such as MoS2, [34,35] PdS, [30,31] and RuO2 [36–40] are coupled with CdS for enhancing the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. But, still noble metal based co catalysts are found to be the best. Among them, Ruthenium (Ru), either in the form of metal or in the oxidized state, has been reported to exhibit good photocatalytic performance when employed as a co-catalyst [36–40]. This highlights the role of Ru based cocatalyst in the process of charge separation. The present work has explored a new combination of co-catalysts along with Zn doped CdS with a view to improve the stability and photocatalytic efficiency of CdS based systems for hydrogen generation from water in the presence of sacrificial reagents. The system studied is Cd1−xZnxS solid solution along with Pt and RuS2 as co-catalysts. Though a number of studies are available using Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions, a combination of this solid solution with Pt and RuS2 dual co-catalysts is not investigated so far. In this system, Pt is expected to work as a reduction co-catalyst whereas RuS2 can function as both reduction and oxidation co-catalysts [30,31]. We have carried out a systematic investigation of the effect of different concentrations of RuS2, Pt and different concentrations of both Pt and RuS2 on the photocatalytic activity of Cd1−xZnxS. The effect of co-catalysts on the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers and the stability of Cd1−xZnxS system is investigated. The improved photocatalytic activity is correlated with the altered physico-chemical properties of the solid solution in the presence of co-catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Cadmium chloride, Zinc acetate, Ruthenium (III) chloride, Hexachloroplatinatic acid, Sodium sulfide, Sodium sulfite and ethanol were used as received. CdS was synthesized by the precipitation of cadmium chloride with sodium sulfide. A mixture of aqueous solution of cadmium chloride (25cm3) and ethyl alcohol (25cm3) was mixed with an aqueous solution of Na2S (25cm3) containing 25cm3 of ethyl alcohol (CdCl2:Na2S=1:1). The solution was thoroughly mixed by constant stirring. The precipitate obtained was separated by centrifugation, washed and dried in an oven at 90°C for 5h followed by calcination in air at 350°C for 3h. ZnS was synthesized by the same method using zinc acetate as the precursor. For the synthesis of different zinc doped CdS photocatalysts (Cd1−xZnxS, where x=0.2, 0.5 and 0.8), a mixture of required amount of aqueous solution of cadmium chloride (25cm3) and ethyl alcohol (25cm3) was mixed with required amount of aqueous solution of zinc acetate (25cm3) containing 25cm3 of ethyl alcohol. Na2S was added to it under constant stirring followed by the same procedure mentioned above. For the synthesis of x%RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S (x% (by weight)=0.5, 1 and 2, referred to as xRuS2-CdZnS in the text), CdZnS powder was suspended in required amount of ruthenium chloride aqueous solution and stirred continuously followed by the addition of aqueous solution of Na2S. Cd0.5Zn0.5S was chosen for loading co-catalysts as this composition showed the highest photocatalytic activity among the Zn doped CdS catalysts. After precipitation of RuS2 on CdZnS, this precipitate is centrifuged, washed with water and ethanol followed by drying in an oven at 90°C for 5h. Pt metal (% by weight, 0.3, 0.5 and 1%) was loaded on CdZnS by a wet impregnation method. Sample powders were kept in contact with aqueous platinum chloride solutions and evaporated to dryness under constant stirring followed by drying in an oven at 90°C for 5h. No reductive treatment was given to this catalyst before photocatalysis experiment. Different concentrations of Pt and RuS2 (y%Pt x%RuS2 by weight, where y=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and x=0.1, 0.2, 1%, named as yPtxRuS2-CdZnS in the text) were loaded on CdZnS to optimize the concentrations of co-catalysts, which can give the best photocatalytic performance. 2.2 Characterization techniques Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these samples were recorded using a Philips PW1820 X-ray diffractometer coupled with a PW 1729 generator, which was operated at 30kV and 20mA. Graphite crystal monochromator was used to get monochromatic CuKα radiation. Surface area of the samples was measured using Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method employing nitrogen as the adsorbing gas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analyses were carried out using a JEOL, JEM 2010 machine. UV–vis diffused reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of all samples were recorded using a Jasco (model V-670) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere accessory. Barium sulfate was used as reference for recording the reflectance spectra. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were done using Edinburgh Instruments FLSP 920 system with a 450W Xe arc lamp as the excitation source and a red sensitive Peltier element cooled Hamamatsu R2658 PMT as the detector. Emission spectra were recorded by exciting the samples at 282nm. All the emission patterns were corrected for the detector response and were measured at 1nm resolution. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, U.K.). The samples were excited by light pulses from a nano-LED source (374nm) and the fluorescence (570nm emission) was detected using a PMT-based detection module (model TBX4). A reconvolution procedure was used to find out the fluorescence life time using instrument response function obtained by substituting the sample cell with a light scatterer (turbid solution of TiO2 nanoparticles in water). With the present setup, the instrument time resolution is adjusted to be ∼160ps. The oxidation states of the elements present in the system were evaluated using X-Ray Phototelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) done in the SPECS instrument with a PHOBIOS 100/150 Delay Line Detector (DLD). Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV) with operating power of 380W was employed as source for all studies. All these measurements were carried out in constant analyzer energy mode with pass energy of 50eV. XPS spectra were first analyzed using the Casa XPS soft-ware. Peak shifts due to any charging were corrected using internal reference of the C 1s line from adventitious carbon (284.5eV). After calibration, the background from each spectrum was subtracted using a Shirley-type background. 2.3 Photocatalytic activity experiment Photocatalytic activity was studied in a tubular glass (Pyrex) reactor using day-light fluorescent lamps as source of radiation. Details of the reactor and irradiation chamber are given in the Supplementary data (S1) and in our earlier publications [41–44]. The emission profile of the fluorescent lamp is given in Fig. S2 of Supplementary data. Fifty milligram of sample was kept in contact with an aqueous solution of Na2S (12.5cm3, 0.6M) and Na2SO3 (12.5cm3, 0.8M) under constant stirring for conducting the photocatalysis experiment. The reactor was flushed with argon gas before irradiation. After every 1h, the gas mixture in the reactor was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Chromatography and Instruments Company, GC 2011) equipped with a molecular sieve 5A column and a thermal conductivity detector. The apparent quantum efficiency was calculated using the equation: AQE (%)=(2×R/I)×100, where R is the rate of evolution of hydrogen molecules per hour and I is the number of incident photons for the same duration (details of calculation are given in Supplementary data, S3). The intensity of the light source was measured using a calibrated energy meter (Gentec Solo2) and the intensity of light incident on the reactor is ∼10mW/cm2. 2.4 Photoelectrochemical experiment CdZnS and 0.2Pt-0.2RuS2-CdZnS were first dispersed in methanol by sonicating the mixtures for 5min and allowed the particles to settle down. The supernatant solution was drop cast on electrochemically prepared porous silicon (p-type, (100) silicon, ρ=1–3Ω-cm) and dried by heating at 60°C. The process was repeated many times till a uniform coating was obtained on the porous silicon structure. Porous structure helps in good adhesion of the particles on the silicon substrate. Photoelectrochemical cells were prepared by using the Si/CdZnS or Si/Pt-RuS2-CdZnS structure as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, Pt wire as the pseudo reference electrode and Na2S:Na2SO3 (1:2) as the electrolyte. A Parstat 2273 system was used for the photoelectrochemical studies. Sunlight type radiation source was a fluorescent lamp (36W, UV content<3%) with light intensity at the cell being 200μW/cm2. 3 Results 3.1 Characterization Powder XRD patterns of CdS, ZnS and different compositions of Cd1−xZnxS are shown in Fig. 1 . Both CdS and ZnS exist as the hexagonal wurtzite phases (JCPDS no. 41–1049) (JCPDS no. 36–1450). XRD patterns of different concentrations of Zn substituted CdS are shown in Fig. 1. The patterns clearly show that a solid solution of CdS and ZnS is formed and no peaks corresponding to any additional phase is seen. XRD peaks of Cd1−xZnxS show a shift to higher angles compared to CdS, which further confirms that they exist as solid solutions. The calculated lattice parameters, ‘a’ and ‘c’ of single phase CdS is 4.128 and 6.684Å respectively, which is close to the values, 4.140Å (‘a’) and 6.719Å (‘c’) reported for hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS no. 41-1049). The corresponding values obtained for Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CdZnS) is 3.888 and 6.353Å respectively. This reduced values of ‘a’ and ‘c’ further confirms that a solid solution of CdZnS has formed. Crystallite size of CdS, CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS was calculated from the XRD peaks using Scherrer equation. The crystallite size of CdS, CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are 40, 11 and 17nm respectively. BET surface area obtained for CdS, ZnS, CdZnS, 1Ru-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are 49, 32, 35, 25 and 28m2 g−1 respectively. Fig. 2 shows the TEM, HRTEM images and SAED pattern of CdZnS. TEM image of CdZnS indicates that its particle size is in range of 20–40nm. The‘d’ spacing of 0.33nm obtained from HRTEM can be assigned to the (100) plane of CdZnS. SAED pattern also could be indexed as the (002) plane of the solid solution. Particle size of 1Ru-CdZnS as seen from Fig. S4 (Supplementary data) is in the range of 10–20nm. Distance between the fringes in the HRTEM image is 0.31nm, which can be assigned to (002) plane of plane of CdZnS. The ‘d’ value obtained from the SAED pattern corresponds to the (002) plane of CdZnS. Fig. 3 shows that the particle size of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS is in the range of 20–50nm. It may be mentioned that the crystallite size calculated from XRD pattern is close to the particle size obtained from TEM. Both HRTEM image and SAED pattern can be indexed as (002) plane of the solid solution. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images for each element of 1Ru-CdZnS is shown in Fig. S5 of Supplementary data. This image suggests a uniform/homogeneous distribution of Ru on CdZnS. STEM image of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS is shown in Fig. S6 of Supplementary data. Images corresponding to Pt and Ru are not obtained due to their low concentrations (0.2% each). 3.2 Optical properties UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS in the absorbance mode) of the composite samples along with their single phase individual compounds are shown in Fig. 4 A. The spectrum of CdZnS shows its absorption edge in between that of CdS and ZnS, which is due to the alteration of band structure of CdS by Zn doping. The absorption spectra of 1RuS2-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS exhibit increased visible light absorption compared to CdZnS, and CdS, which can be attributed to the presence of RuS2. Fig. 4B shows the modified Kubelka–Munk function [(F(R)hν)] 2 plotted against hν for CdS, CdZnS, ZnS, 1Ru-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS samples. The bandgap energy values obtained for CdS, 1Ru-CdZnS, CdZnS, 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS and ZnS from this plot are 2.4, 2.1, 2.8, 2.7 and 3.4eV respectively. PL spectra of CdS, ZnS, CdZnS, 1Ru-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are shown in Fig. 5 . The spectrum of CdS shows a broad peak in the wavelength region of 500–670nm and centered around 580nm. This peak can be assigned to the emission from the defect levels/surface states of CdS. Spectrum of ZnS shows a broad intense emission around 420nm and a weak broad emission around 570nm. As the bandgap of ZnS is 3.4eV, these peaks cannot be due to the bandedge emission. These emissions are originating from the defect levels having different energies. CdZnS shows a very broad emission spectrum in the wavelength region of 400–680nm and the peak is red shifted compared to ZnS, due to Cd incorporation in ZnS. This broad spectrum suggests the presence of a number of defect levels/surface states of varying energies in this system. Spectrum of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS is similar to that of CdZnS. 1Ru-CdZnS exhibits hardly any emission due to the black color of the sample. Fluorescence emission decay studies were carried out to get information about the lifetime of charge carriers in these samples. The time resolved fluorescence decay plots (for emission at 570nm) are shown in Fig. 5B. The plots could be fitted satisfactorily as triexponential decay and the lifetime values obtained for CdZnS are τ1 =8.8ns (5%), τ2 =0.26ns (2%) and τ3 =155ns (93%). The values obtained for 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are τ1 =9.4ns (11%), τ2 =0.41ns (3%) and τ3 =187ns (86%). This multiple lifetime values further confirm the presence of different types of defect levels of varying energies in these systems. The average lifetime obtained for CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are 144 and 162ns respectively [45]. Thus, the fluorescence lifetime studies clearly indicate an increased decay lifetime for the charge carriers in the composite containing co-catalysts. When CdZnS comes in contact with Pt or RuS2, the following processes can occur (i) transfer of photogenerated electrons from SC to noble metal. But, back transfer is prevented due to the Schottky barrier formed at the interface. Thus, metal acts as a sink of electrons resulting in the availability of a large number of electrons for the reduction reaction and hence the photocatalytic activity increases. This process prevents the recombination of charge carriers [46] (ii) secondly, due to the interaction of CdZnS with metal or another semiconductor like RuS2, defect levels are created. The presence of a number of defect levels is seen in the PL spectra of these samples. The photogenerated electrons can get trapped in these states and eventually released resulting in recombination. This can increase the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. The electrons trapped in shallow surface states can enhance the photocatalytic activity [47]. Increased lifetime for the charge carriers in heterostructured systems like Zn O-CdS has been reported earlier from the fluorescence emission decay spectroscopy [48]. In the case of Zn O-CdS heterostructured system, the decay lifetime was prolonged to 220ns whereas for single phase ZnO or CdS the corresponding value obtained was 60ns. The increased lifetime was assigned to the transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes between ZnO and CdS. 3.3 Surface characterization Ru 3p3/2 spectra of 1Ru-CdZnS, 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS-AC (after photocatalysis experiment) are shown in Fig. 6 . 1Ru-CdZnS shows a peak having a binding energy (BE) of 461.6eV, which can be assigned to the Ru4+ state of RuS2 [49]. CdZnS with Pt and Ru (0.2% each) co-catalysts also show a peak with a BE of 461.4eV corresponding to RuS2. There is no significant change in the peak position of Ru 3p 3/2 peak in the spectrum of this sample after photocatalysis experiment suggesting that RuS2 is stable under the present experimental conditions. Pt 4f7/2 spectra of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS-AC are shown in Fig. 6. No peak due to Pt could be obtained in the spectrum of fresh (unreduced and as prepared) sample as the concentration of Pt is very low and it can be in a dispersed state. The spectrum of the sample after the photocatalysis studies shows a very low intense peak at a BE of 71.6eV, which can be assigned to the Pt° state [49]. This result indicates that Pt4+ of H2PtCl6 gets reduced insitu during photocatalysis experiment to form Pt metal clusters, which is detected by XPS. Cd 3d spectra of CdS, CdZnS, 1Ru-CdZnS, 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS-AC are shown in Fig. S7 (Supplementary data). All samples show the 3d 5/2 peak around 405eV corresponding to the Cd2+ state [50]. Zn 2p 3/2 spectra (Fig. S7) show a peak around 1022eV corresponding to the Zn2+ state in these samples. The S 2p spectrum of CdS (Fig. S7) shows a peak at 161.6eV, which can be assigned to the S2− of CdS [50]. The spectra of ZnS, CdZnS, 1Ru-CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS show an additional peak around 169eV and it is attributed to the S6+ state of surface sulfate species [44,51]. This peak may be originating from the heat treatment of the sample. The peak due to sulfate is absent in the spectrum of the sample after the photocatalysis experiment suggesting that the reduction of these species occur during photocatalysis process. 3.4 Photocatalytic activity and stability Photocatalytic activity of different compositions of Cd1−xZnxS along with CdS and ZnS for hydrogen generation from water in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents is shown in Fig. 7 A. It can be seen from the figure that the photocatalytic activity of different solid solutions of CdS and ZnS is greater than that of pristine CdS and ZnS. A large increase in the photocatalytic activity is observed for Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CdZnS) compared to other compositions of solid solutions of CdS and ZnS. As CdZnS composition showed the highest photocatalytic activity, further experiments were done using this composition. Effect of different concentrations of RuS2 as co-catalyst on the photocatalytic activity of CdZnS is shown in Fig. S8 (A) of Supplementary data. The optimum concentration of RuS2 to give higher activity appears to be 1% in CdZnS. Photocatalytic activity of CdZnS having different concentrations of Pt is shown in Fig. S8 (B) of Supplementary data. It is seen that 0.5% Pt shows relatively better activity compared to 0.3 and 1% compositions. Effect of both RuS2 and Pt as co-catalysts on the photocatalytic activity of CdZnS was studied by varying the compositions of both co-catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. S9 of Supplementary data. It can be seen that the optimum concentration of Pt and RuS2 is 0.2% each and a significant increase in the activity is seen compared to CdZnS. Photocatalytic activity of CdZnS having optimized concentrations of Pt, RuS2 and Pt-Ru dual co-catalysts for hydrogen generation is shown in Fig. 7B. A significant increase in photocatalytic activity is seen for CdZnS when both Pt and RuS2 are used as co-catalysts. A hydrogen generation rate of 724μmolesg−1 h−1 (0.72mmolg−1 h−1) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 4% are obtained using this composition when irradiated with day light fluorescent lamp (UV<3%, irradiated area=62cm2, light intensity ∼10mW/cm2). Reusability of the photocatalyst, 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S was tested by repeating the photocatalytic experiment for 60h after flushing the same system using argon gas (after each cycle of 12h experiment) and the result is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the photocatalytic activity is almost the same with repeated use of the catalyst indicating that the catalyst is stable under the present experimental conditions. Photocatalytic activity of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S under direct sunlight was carried out using the same concentration of catalyst and sacrificial reagents used for the indoor experiment using fluorescent lamp as source of radiation. The results are compared in Fig. S10 of Supplementary data. It can be seen that the photocatalytic activity has increased significantly under natural sunlight irradiation and a hydrogen generation rate of 1240μmolesg−1 h−1 (1.2mmolg−1 h−1) is obtained. The increased activity arises due to the difference in the light source used and the increased intensity of light incident on the reactor. A direct comparison of the photocatalytic activity/efficiency of catalysts using different light sources is improper as the spectra of different light sources are different. However, the hydrogen generation rate and quantum efficiencies reported for similar systems are given here which can give a qualitative idea about the efficiencies of different systems. A quantum yield of 16.2% (at 420nm) and a hydrogen generation rate of 3.43mmolh−1g−1 is reported for Cd0.2Zn0.8S when irradiated with light of wavelength between 420 to 780nm from a 300W xenon arc lamp [29]. A hydrogen generation rate of 239μmolesh−1 g−1 is reported for Pt-Zn0.8Cd0.2S using light of wavelength greater than 418nm from a 500W Xenon arc lamp [28]. A hydrogen generation rate of 770μmolesh−1 g−1 is obtained for Zn0.5Cd0.5S/RGO composite using 300W Xenon arc lamp (λ>420nm) [26]. A composite system, Pt/Cd1−xZnxS/ZnO/Zn (OH)2 gave a quantum efficiency of 12.4% and a hydrogen generation rate of 3.4mmolh−1 g−1 when irradiated with light, λ>450nm from an LED source [27]. Gong et al. has reported a hydrogen generation rate of 7.4mmolh−1 g−1 using Cd0.5Zn0.5S synthesized by a zinc-cadmium-thiourea complex thermolysis method. The light source used was 350W xenon arc lamp (λ>400nm) and the light intensity focused on the reactor was 180mW/cm2 [52]. It may be noted that the light intensity incident on the reactor is ∼18 times more intense than the intensity used in our study. The lower activity of our catalyst compared to some of the reported systems can be attributed to the difference in the light source and the light intensity used for the photocatalytic experiment. 3.5 Photoelectrochemical property The I–V plots of Si/CdZnS and Si/0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS are shown in Fig. 9 A. For the cell consisting of Si/CdZnS anode, under dark, the I–V characteristics show the p-n junction properties. Sunlight type radiation produces significant increase in the current under negative bias due to the visible light sensitivity of CdZnS having a band gap 2.8eV with non-zero current (μA) at zero potential. It is clear from Fig. 9A that CdZnS has considerable photoconducting property whereas the photovoltaic property is not significant. Si/0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS electrode too, produces appreciable photocurrent when illuminated. But, when compared to Si/CdZnS, no significant increase in the photocurrent is observed for Si/0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS. Fig. 9B shows the switching characteristics of the photoelectrochemical cells consisting of Si/CdZnS and Si/0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS anodes under dark and light conditions. Both samples exhibit excellent and stable switching properties by showing a sudden increase in the current when the lamp is on and switching back to the background level immediately after the lamp is switched off. Besides, both show consistent switching characteristics during the repeated cycles of on-off experiments. In this experiment also, no considerable difference in the photocurrent response is observed for Si/0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS and Si/CdZnS system. 4 Discussion The large increase in photocatalytic activity of CdZnS compared to undoped CdS is due to the altered band structure of CdS. It is known that Zn doping increases the bandgap of CdS and the conduction band of the solid solution thus formed shifts to more negative value with a conduction band level much higher than the H+/H2 reduction potential [18–29]. As a result, the reduction of H+ is enhanced and increased hydrogen generation from water is observed. Though, the increase in the bandgap can limit its visible light absorption, optimization of the concentration of Cd and Zn in the solid solution can strike a balance between the optical absorption property and CB potential, which can give rise to increased photocatalytic activity. In our studies, it is seen that 50% is the optimum concentration of Zn which can improve the photocatalytic activity of CdS significantly and the activity is found to be nearly 30 times higher than that of undoped CdS. The improvement of photocatalytic activity of CdZnS when Pt or RuS2 was used as co-catalyst is due to the better charge separation occurring in the composite system. The conduction band potential of RuS2 is at a lower level and VB potential is at a higher level than that of CdZnS as shown in the schematic diagram, Fig. 10 A [53]. Hence, both the photogenerated electrons and holes can be transferred from CdZnS to RuS2 through the hetrojunctions, which increases the lifetime of charge carriers and photocatalytic activity. The increased activity in the presence of Pt co-catalyst is well known and can be explained in terms of the large work function and low overpotential of Pt for proton reduction. The significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution achieved by the presence of both Pt and RuS2 as cocatalysts is attributable to a facile electron and hole migration from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to the Pt–RuS2 co-catalysts. This process minimizes the possibility of electrons recombining with holes and improves the charge separation efficiency. This promoting effect is much greater when both Pt and RuS2 are present as co-catalysts, compared with a single co-catalyst. A schematic diagram of electron and hole transfer in the 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS is shown in Fig. 10B. Thus, the existence of dual co-catalysts, RuS2 and Pt, synergistically promote the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of the system. The increased stability of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS arises due to the transfer of photogenerated holes from the VB of CdZnS to the VB of RuS2. A main disadvantage of sulfide semiconductor photocatalyst is the photo-instability due to the following reaction CdS+2h+ →Cd2+ +S XPS results showed that Pt4+ is reduced to Pt during photocatalytic reaction whereas Ru remains as Ru4+ even after photocatalysis experiment. No significant change occurs on the surface to any element of the 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS system after photocatalysis except for surface sulfate species. When Pt alone is used as co-catalyst, transfer of photogenerated electrons can take place from CdZnS to Pt, but the holes remain in the catalyst and can initiate photocorrosion of CdS. Higher activity is obtained when alternative sites are introduced to the Pt/CdZnS for the hole transfer. These results further demonstrate that the dual co catalysts, Pt and RuS2, show a synergistic effect in increasing the photocatalytic activity of CdZnS by minimizing the recombination of charge carriers and photocorrosion. The different behavior of CdZnS and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS towards the photocatalytic and photo electrochemical processes can be understood by considering the inherent differences of the two phenomena. It is seen that the band gaps of both these samples are almost the same (∼2.8eV) suggesting similar responses in generating photogenerated carriers. The main difference is the effective charge separation due to the presence of dual co-catalysts in 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS system. In both these systems, a large number of photoelectrons are produced when exposed to light. In the case of 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-CdZnS system, photogenerated electrons can get trapped and immobilized in the defect states and surface clusters of Pt and RuS2. These trapped electrons interact with the H+ adsorbed on the surface to form H2 and as the number of trapped electrons increases, the photocatalytic H2 generation increases [54]. The trapping of photogenerated electrons is possible in CdZnS system also as it contains defect states. But, it is less effective compared to the system containing Pt and RuS2 co-catalysts as is evident from the fluorescence life time studies and hence show relatively less photocatalytic activity. However, the photocurrent response is almost similar for both as the electrons trapped in these shallow states are easily available when a voltage is applied. These reversibly trapped electrons have less impact on the photocurrent generation and shows good response when a voltage is applied. 5 Conclusions Zn doped CdS having a composition of Cd0.5Zn0.5S shows significantly high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation from water compared to undoped CdS. The enhanced activity is attributed to the altered band structure of CdS due to Zn doping, which can shift the conduction band to more negative values compared to H+/H2 reduction potential resulting in enhanced reduction of H+ to H2. Though Pt or RuS2 co-catalyst enhances the photocatalytic activity, the increase in activity is more pronounced when both Pt and RuS2 co-exist in Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Presence of Pt and RuS2 dual co-catalysts synergistically promote the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The system, 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S, is found to be very stable and the increased stability is attributed to the transfer of photogenerated holes from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to RuS2 preventing the photocorrosion of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Both Cd0.5Zn0.5S and 0.2Pt0.2RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S show excellent and stable photocurrent response and switching characteristics under on-off conditions of light. The photocurrent response is almost the same for both these systems unlike their photocatalytic properties and this difference is correlated with the difference in the mechanism of these two processes.

        "dc:description": "A new combination of co-catalysts and photocatalyst, Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S, is found to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation from water. The presence of dual co-catalysts not only improves the photocatalytic activity but also increases the stability of the CdZnS photocatalyst. Increased visible light absorption and a decrease in bandgap occur for Cd0.5Zn0.5S in the presence of the co-catalysts. All samples exist as nanocrystalline materials with a particle size in the range of 20–50nm. In this system, Ru is in 4+ oxidation state and Pt is in metallic state. Photoluminescence studies suggest the presence of a number of defect levels/surface states in these catalysts, whose energy vary with the composition of the catalyst. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S is attributed to the better separation of photogenerated charge carriers assisted by the dual co-catalysts. Another remarkable property exhibited by this system is the increased stability for repeated use, which can be attributed to the effective transfer of photogenerated holes from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to RuS2, which minimizes the photo corrosion of the catalyst. Photoelectrochemical results show a significant increase in the photocurrent with applied voltage and excellent switching characteristics for both Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S and Cd0.5Zn0.5S. No discernible improvement in photocurrent is seen for Pt-RuS2-Cd0.5Zn0.5S compared to Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The difference in the photocatalytic and photo electrochemical property is explained based on the inherent differences of the two phenomena.",
