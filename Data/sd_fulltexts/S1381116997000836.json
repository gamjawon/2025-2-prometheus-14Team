Stereoelectronic effects were shown later to control also hydrolytic processes, in particular orthoesters, esters, lactones, amides and lac- tames hydrolysis [4,5]. These aspects were re- viewed by Deslongchamps [6] and Kirby [7].

In fact, from a study on model compounds, those results were ex- plained in terms of stereoelectronic effects by the difference in energy between ground state and transition state conformations [9]. Rigid models of oz-glycosides were shown to hydro- lyze through their ground state conformation, whereas /3-glycosides must assume a boat con- formation to fulfill the stereoelectronic require- ment of the antiperiplanar electron lone pair orientation as shown in Scheme 2. All these results were obtained under homo- geneous catalysis conditions. It was thus possi- ble to consider how stereoelectronic effects can apply to heterogeneously catalyzed reactions in- volving carbon-heteroatom bonds cleavage, namely hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis of acetals and thioacetals. In a previous work [10], it has been shown that hydrolysis of acetals like benzaldehyde di- ethyl acetal and 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane oc- curred at relatively similar rates in the presence of acidic zeolites, compared to the large differ- ence observed in solution [11].

It was sulfided at atmo- spheric pressure using a fluidized-bed technique with a gas mixture of 15% H2S and 85% He by volume. The catalyst (particle size 0.063-0.125 mm) was heated in flowing H2/H2S (gas flow, 120 ml/min) from 20 to 400 (8/rain) and held at 400 for 4 h, then cooled, and finally swept with nitrogen for 30 min. 2.3. Hydrolysis experiments in the presence of zeolites play a role on the reaction rates was already considered. The aim of this work was then to investigate further on this latter aspect in reactions involv- ing acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde and furfural (Fig. 1), namely hydrolysis in the pres- ence of H-form zeolites, and hydrogenolysis in the presence of sulfided catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Acetals and thioacetals were synthesized from the corresponding aldehydes avaiiable commer- cially (Aldrich), and according to standard pro- cedures reported in the literature [11]. 2.2. Catalysts Appropriate diluted hydrochloric solutions were used for homogeneous hydrolysis reac- tions. For heterogeneous hydrolysis reactions, two dealuminated H-mordenites were used, the first one with a Si/A1 ratio of 11.1 (benzal- dehyde derivatives) and the other one with a Si/A1 ratio of 49 (furfural derivatives). Both catalysts were obtained from Zeocat. The alumina supported cobalt~-molybdenum catalyst was Procatalyse HR 306 which has the Reaction kinetics were followed by UV spec- trophotometry (Gilford 250) by recording the increase in optical density due to the formation of the aldehyde at the corresponding Areax as a function of time. The procedure was as follows. A weighted amount of powder was dispersed in 40 ml of deionized water in thermostated flask (25) under stirring and 10 /xl of pure acetal were added to this solution. An aliquot of fil- tered solution was continuously fed into a 100 ttl recirculating UV cell using a volumetric pump and the optical density was recorded ver- sus time. The rate constants were deduced from the experimental plots by curve fitting and simula- tion using a pseudo-first order kinetic model: D = Dinf -}- (Dinf - D0)e-~t, where Dinf and D are the optical densities at infinite and t times respectively, Do is the optical density at zero tim, and k is the observed rate constant. 2.4. Hydrogenolysis experiments in the presence of sulfides Hydrogenolysis experiments were carried out in a 0.3 1 stirred autoclave (Autoclave Engineers Magne-Drive), working in the batch mode and equipped with a system for sampling of liquid during the course of the reaction without stop- ping the agitation.

Hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde Relative hydrolysis rates of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde obtained in water as the solvent at 298 K are reported in Table 1 for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed reac- tions.

In a general manner and for reactions cat- alyzed by homogeneous catalysts, acetals are readily hydrolyzed provided that one oxygen atom has an electron lone pair oriented antiperi- planar to the leaving group. These conditions are fulfilled for most of the six possible con- formers which represent acetals in their differ- ent forms (Fig. 2). Conformer A is the stable model of /3-glycosides with one gauche interac- tion and one anomeric effect. Conformer B has two gauche interactions and one anomeric ef- fect. Conformer C has only two gauche interac- tions and conformer D is the stable model of oz-glycosides with one gauche interaction and two anomeric effects. Finally, conformer E is the stable model of 1,3-dioxolanes and 1,3-di- oxanes with the substituent R in an equatorial position, whereas this position is axial in con- C.

Taking into account gauche interac- tions between R and R' groups and anomeric effects, the increasing order of stability for acyclic acetals is the following: D > A > B > C. It is thus seen that 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane and benzaldehyde diethyl acetal in iti. a- or /3-form can be hydrolyzed under stereoelectronic con- trol (Fig. 3). The lower reactivity of the cyclic acetal is normally explained by e atropic reasons due to ring opening. In a similar way, 2-phenyl-l,3-oxathiolane fulfills the stereoelectronic requirement of the antiperiplanar orientation with respect to the leaving group. However, the S-cc,ntaining acetal reacts much more slowly and its lower reactiv- ity was indicating of sulfur protcnation prior to the rate-determining cleavage of the protonated C-S bond leading to the oxocarbonium interme- diate (Scheme 3) [11]. For the reaction catalyzed b'zeolites, the situation is different since the reaction takes place on the surface of a solid, and adsorption is an important parameter to be taken into account. The rate of hydrolysis of benzaldehyde diethyl acetal in its most stable o~-form (Fig. 3) may be seen as lowered compared to the rate of hydrol- ysis of 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane. That would be the result of a steric hindrance to adsorption onto the catalyst surface. An alternative expla- nation, but with exactly the same consequences, is that benzaldehyde diethyl acetal reacts through its less stable /3-form (Fig. 3). Due now to the two well oriented electron lone pairs of the heteroatoms, thus favoring both adsorption and accessibility to the protonic sites, such a /3-form could not be ruled out. Indeed, that would also account for the small differences observed in the hydrolysis rates of benzaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2-phenyl-l,3-dioxolane and 2-phenyl- 1,3-oxathiolane over solid catalysts. This last explanation would be preferred since in agreement with both stereoelectronic effects and basic principles of heterogeneous catalysis. The consequences of the favorable orientation of the electron lone pair(s) are an increase of the length of the C-heteroatom leaving group which becomes easier to be broken, and an increase of the basicity of the leaving group, leading to H H H H 2-phenyl 1,3-dioxolan V-q C)_ .O-qc,.s+ O_. s.

Furthermore, this explanation would be in line with some results reported in the literature concerning hydrogenolysis of isomeric dihy- droxybenzenes on oxide catalysts where the ge- ometries of the substrates and their ability to adsorb on the catalyst surface were shown to play a central role [13]. 3.2. Hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of ~rfural Table 2 reports the experimental results ob- tained concerning hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of furfural in operating conditions similar to those used for hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde. The results reported in this table do not deserve further comments as far as the parallelism in the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 is quite obvious. 3.3.

Kinetic reaction scheme for hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde. then take some sense as far as a similar situation was observed for the hydrogenolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde over sulfided catalysts (Table 3). Under the operating conditions used, the re- action proceeds through the formation of benzyl ethyl ether as intermediate, the final product being toluene (Fig. 4). The mechanism proposed for the cleavage of C-O and C-S bonds in the presence of hydrogen, over that kind of cata- lysts, was first an electron transfer from the heteroatom to an anionic vacancy present on the surface of the catalyst, followed by a hydride transfer from the metal to the carbon atom (Fig. 5) [14,15]. From Table 3 it is then seen that, as for hydrolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzal- dehyde and furfural over solid acids, no large difference in the reaction rates is observed for hydrogenolysis of acetals and thioacetals of benzaldehyde over sulfided catalysts. This result was not unexpected since it is known that the cleavage of a C-S bond is favored over that of a C-O bond in the presence of sulfided cata- Table 3 Relative hydrogenolysis rates of acetals and thioacetals of benzal- dehyde Acetals Hydrogenolysis 2-phenyl- 1,3-dioxolane 1 2-phenyl- 1,3 -oxathiolane 2.2 Benzaldehyde diethyl acetal 6 ,&O-- Et Ph -- CH 4~O__Et H [] Mo/ ,,..... \\ Fig. 5.

In addition, hydrogenolysis of iso- meric dihydroxybenzenes on sulfided catalysts was again accounted for in terms of geometries of the substrates and their ability to adsorb on the catalyst surface [16]. 4. Conclusions The experimental results reported illustrate once again that mechanistic concepts developed in homogeneous catalyzed reactions can readily apply to reactions catalyzed by solids as it was now well demonstrated for a wide series of reactions [17]. In the present work, it is thus reported the first attempt to show how stereoelectronic ef- fects, largely involved in cleavage of C-hetero- atom bonds, can apply to reaction~ taking place on the surface of a solid. These effects were shown to operate in a classical manner on a molecular standpoint, but they are reinforced due to the favorable interaction of heteroatoms electron lone pairs with the elecLron deficient species present on the surface of the solid, protonic species in the case of zeolites and anionic vacancies in the case of ~ulfided cata- lysts.

        "dc:description": "Hydrolysis of benzaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane and 2-phenyl-1,3-oxathiolane occurs at relatively similar rates in the presence of acidic zeolites compared to the large difference observed in solution. A similar behavior is again observed with the corresponding acetals and thioacetals of furfural. In a similar way, hydrogenolysis of benzaldehyde diethyl acetal, 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane and 2-phenyl-1,3-oxathiolane also occurs at relatively similar rates in the presence of sulfided catalysts. The weak difference in the observed reaction rates could be interpreted in terms of stereoelectronic effects, i.e. through a most favorable adsorption of cyclic acetals and thioacetals as due to the orientation of their oxygen or sulfur electron lone pairs, thus leading to a better electron transfer to protonic species in the case of zeolites and to anionic vacancies in the case of sulfided catalysts.",
