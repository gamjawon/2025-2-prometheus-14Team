Crisafulli*, R. Maggiore, S. Scire Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche, Universita di Catania, Viale A. Doria 6, I-95127 Catania (Italy) S. Galvagno, C. Milone Dipartimento di Chimica Industriale, Universita di Messina, Cas. Post. 29,1-98166 Sant Agata di Messina (Italy) (Received December 7, 1992; accepted March 22, 1993 ) Abstract Bimetallic Ru-Cu samples supported on silica gel having different surface areas have been characterized by TPR (temperature programmed reduction) and CO chemisorption. The catalytic properties have been tested in the hydrogenolysis of propane. Ruthenium and copper salts which do not contain chlorine have been used for catalyst preparation. The surface area of the supports used ranged from 25 to 500 m2/g. The Cu/Ru atomic ratio was varied between 0 and 4. Addition of Cu decreases the catalytic activity and increases the selectivity to ethane. The largest variations are observed on the support with larger surface area. It is suggested that a larger RuCu interaction occurs on the smaller metal particles due to the higher tendency of the Cu atoms of populating low coordination sites. Key words: bimetallic catalysts; copper; hydrogenolysis; ruthenium; surface area Introduction In recent years supported bimetallic catalysts have received much attention because of their capability in controlling activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions of industrial interest. Among the bimetallic catalysts, RuCu samples have been found of particular interest as model systems to obtain information on the nature of the interactions occurring between metal-metal and metal-support. An extensive research has been carried out on supported Ru-Cu catalysts [ 1-14 ] and on single crystal Ru surfaces covered by Cu [ 1518]. Since the early work of Sinfelt [ 11, it has been proposed that Ru and Cu, which are immiscible in the bulk state, can form bimetallic aggregates which are obtained by chemisorption of Cu on the Ru surface. The presence of Cu has been found strongly to depress the catalytic activity towards hydrogenolysis reactions. This effect is usually ascribed to the disruption of the Ru active ensembles by the inert Cu [ 10 ] . Recent papers on supported Ru-Cu catalysts *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 238 C. Crisafulli et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 have also shown that the degree of interaction between the two metals and therefore the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity are strongly influenced by the precursor salts used and by the nature of the support. In a study carried out on Ru-Cu supported on Si02, A1203, MgO, it has been observed that the highest interaction is found on the Si02 support [ 12,19,20 ] . The results of Hong et al. [ 10 ] show that also the nature of the silica used as support influences the performance of the Ru-Cu catalysts. In this paper we report the results of a systematic study carried out on a series of silica gels, each having a different surface area, in order to verify the influence of this parameter on the formation of Ru-Cu clusters. Experimental Ru-Cu samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the supports with aqueous solutions of Ru (NO) (N03) 3 (Johnson Matthey) and Cu(N03)2 (Carlo Erba) having the appropriate concentration of metals. The concentration of salt (s) in the solution was adjusted to yield a total (Ru + Cu) metal content of 2 wt.%. The supports used were silica gels of differing surface areas supplied by Grace. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the silica samples used as support. Total surface area and pore diameter have been measured by adsorption of N2 at liquid nitrogen temperature and by mercury porosimetry. Increasing the surface area of the support causes the volume of the smaller pores (measured by BET) to increase. On the low surface area samples large pores are mainly present. Chemisorption of CO was measured in a conventional pulse system operating at room temperature. Pulses of a mixture of 10 vol.% CO in He were used. Negligible amounts of CO were found to chemisorb on the supports and on Cu/Si02. TPR (Temperature Programmed Reduction) experiments were carried TABLE 1 Characterization of Si02supports by BRT and mercury porosimeter (MP) Code Surface area Pore volume Pore radius (m2 g-1) (cm' (STP) g-') (A) BET MP BET MP BET MP A 23 29 0.06 1.0 51 690 B 80 118 0.17 1.2 42 203 C 164 150 0.33 0.85 40 113 D 306 165 0.68 0.80 44 97 E 481 130 0.98 0.50 40 77 C.

The gas used in TPR was a mixture of 5 vol.% H2 in Ar and the oxidizing gas was air. The measurement procedure consisted in a first TPR of the fresh catalyst precursor from 35 to 500 C (TPR-1), cooling to 300 C in a H2/Ar mixture, oxidation of the sample in air (from 300 to 500 C at 5 C/min and for 1 h at 500 C) . After cooling to room temperature, a second TPR (TPR-2 ) was performed. Catalytic activity was tested for propane hydrogenolysis. The reaction was carried out in a differential mode employing a tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure and using helium as diluent. Before catalytic activity measurements, catalyst samples were reduced \"in situ\" at 400 C in flowing H2. Details of the experimental apparatus and gas-chromatographic analysis are reported elsewhere [ 12 ] . Since preliminary runs showed a decrease of activity with time, the following procedure was used to measure initial rates. The reactant gases were passed over the catalyst for 2 min before sampling the products for analysis. The hydrocarbon feed and the helium were then cut out and the catalyst was treated at 350 C in flowing H2 before taking another experimental point. By using the above procedure, the initial rates were reproducible to within 23%. Reaction rates were determined at a partial pressure of propane of 9 kPa and hydrogen of 30 kPa. The conversion was kept low (<5%) in order to operate under differential conditions. The absence of mass transfer limitations was verified by runs carried out at different flow rates and catalyst grain sizes.

Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 CO on the Ru surface has not been clearly established, we prefer to use CO as probe molecule in order to avoid spillover phenomena which could lead to an overestimation of the Ru surface. Spillover of hydrogen from Ru to Cu in bimetallic RU-CU/Si02caltalysts has in fact been reported [ 21 ] . An increase of the Si02 surface area leads to an increase of the CO/Ru ratio which reaches a value of about 1 on supports with surface area larger than 300 m2 g-1. The sample prepared from RuC13 shows a lower dispersion. Catalytic activity has been tested in the hydrogenolysis of propane which under the experimental conditions used, leads to a product ratio CH4/C2H6 > 1. This indicates that two reactions take place: C3H8 +H2 --* CH4 + C2 Hs (1) C3 H8 + 2H2 -.3CH4 (2 ) As previously reported, reactions (1) and (2) can be considered as non-separate processes and the hydrogenolysis of propane can be treated as successive reactions of adsorbed intermediates (C3, C2) [22]. In our case we preferred the above formalism based on reactions (1) and (2) by analogy with previous work on similar systems [ 12,22,23 ] . Under the experimental conditions used, formation of methane through hydrogenolysis of ethane is negligible due to the much lower rate of this latter reaction with respect to propane hydrogenolysis and to the low conversions used to minimize the consecutive reaction. The overall rate of reaction was calculated by the expression: V=FX/V where F is the feed rate of propane, X is the fraction of consumed propane and W the weight of catalyst. Selectivity towards reaction (1) was calculated by the equation: S=100 Xl/X where X, is the fraction of propane consumed through reaction (1) . Table 3 lists the catalytic activity data at 200 C expressed both in terms of moles of propane converted per gram of Ru (V) and also per Ru surface atom (N), as calculated from CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry CO/Ru=1. The use of a different stoichiometry would not significantly change the conclusions of the present work. The turnover rate (N) was found to be independent of the Ru dispersion in the range investigated. The activation energy for the overall disappearance of propane was almost constant in all samples and in the range 26-30 kcal/mol. Selectivity to reaction (1) was instead found to increase with Ru dispersion. On the less dispersed sample (SAl00N) the selectivity, S, at 200 C was about 31 % and increased up to 59% on the more dispersed sample. C. Crisafulli et al./J. Mol.

Ru-Cu/Si02 catalysts Addition of Cu to Ru/Si02 modifies drastically the performance of Ru. Table 4 shows the effect of addition of Cu on the chemisorption properties. Under the conditions used Cu does not chemisorb CO. On addition of Cu, the CO/Ru ratio on the catalysts with a low surface area increases. On the other samples the CO/Ru ratio was close to 1 already in the absence of Cu and did not significantly change in the presence of the group Ib metal. Figure 1 shows the TPR-1 profiles of the Ru-Cu samples supported on the low surface area silica (silica A). The reduction occurs in the same temperature range where the Ru precursor is reduced. The temperature of reduction of Cu is lowered and only on the sample with the highest Cu/Ru ratio is a shoulder at higher temperature observed. Similar results are obtained on the Si02 supports with higher surface area. In any case the reduction is complete at a temperature lower than that observed on the CU/Si02 samples. On all samples the amount of hydrogen consumed was close to that expected for the reduction of the precursors according to the following equations: 242 C. Crisafulli et al./J. Mol.

TPR-2 is carried out after oxidation of the samples already reduced in TPR-1 (see Experimental section). At low Cu/Ru ratios we notice, on addition of Cu, a shift of the reduction peak to higher temperature with the appearance of a shoulder at T> 150 C. Monometalhc Cu/Si02 always showed a TPR-2 profile comprising one single peak with a maximum at about 215 C regardless of the surface area of the support and of the amount (0.2-2.0 wt.%) of Cu present in the sample. On the samples with a high Cu/Ru ratio two well resolved peaks are obtained. Qualitatively similar behaviour is also observed on the other supports. The effect of addition of Cu on the catalytic properties of Ru/Si02 is shown in Table 3. Increasing the Cu/Ru ratio decreases the catalytic activity. Such an effect is much more pronounced on the high surface area supports. On silica A the presence of 80 at.% of Cu (SA020N) leads to a decrease of the turnover number of about one order of magnitude whereas on a similar sample supported on silica E, the activity was found to decrease by about two orders of magnitude. The apparent activation energy on the bimetallic samples is generally higher with respect to the monometallic ones. Only on the less active catalysts is an activation energy similar to that measured on the monometallic samples observed. In the range of temperature used the Arrhenius plot of the overall propane conversion always gave a straight line.

Increasing the Cu content the ratio CH4/CZHs in the reaction products decreases to reach a value close to 1 (S>90%) on the samples having a Cu/Ru ratio of 4 (samples SX020N ). Discussion The results of CO chemisorption on the monometallic Ru/Si02 samples (Table 2) clearly indicate an increase of the CO uptake with increasing surface area of the support. Such an increase can be related to the formation of smaller Ru metal particles on the supports with larger surface area, which can be explained on the basis of a lower surface concentration of the precursor and/or of stronger interaction of the Ru precursor with the support. The presence on the different silicas of Ru particles with different size is confirmed by the electron micrographs (Fig. 3). Even though a particle size distribution has not been determined it is clear that on silica A, ruthenium particles are significantly larger than those observed on silica E. The results of propane hydrogenolysis over the monometallic Ru/Si02 samples (Table 3) show that the overall rate of reaction increases with the surface area of the support, and that the turnover frequencies, N, do not vary with changing the Ru dispersion. An increase of the selectivity towards reaction (1) with increasing the Ru dispersion is instead observed. Such results indicate that the rate of reaction is directly related to the number of sites counted by CO uptake and suggest that the rate of hydrogenolysis of propane does not depend on the Ru particle size, at least under the experimental conditions used in this work. It is interesting to note that, when extrapolated to the same conditions, the results shown in Table 3 for the monometallic Ru samples are very similar in terms of N with those reported in ref. 24. In fact, if the turnover frequencies reported in ref. 24 are extrapolated to the conditions used in this work a value of N of 2.4 s-1 can be calculated on the 3.86 wt.% Ru/Si02 sample (Ru exposed-26%) and a value of 2.9 s-1 on the 3.0 wt% Ru/Si02 sample (Ru exposed-43% ). These values are practically the same as those reported in Table 3. This is further confirmation that using the experimental procedure described in this work, which is similar to that reported in ref. 24, the overall rate of hydrogenolysis of propane does not depend on the Ru particle size. A direct comparison with the selectivities reported in ref. 24 cannot be made due to the different reaction temperature used, but it should be noted that a decrease in the selectivity towards reaction (1) was also observed on increasing the Ru particle size. Hydrogenolysis is often considered a \"structure-sensitive\" reaction. However the effect of the particle size on the overall reaction rate is not always clear and contradicting results are reported in the literature [ 14 ]. It is possible that the observed discrepancy is related to a different amount C. Crisafulli et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 245 Fig. 3. TEM of monometallic Ru samples supported on silicas of differing surface areas. ( a ) SAl00N; (b) SEl00N. of carbonaceous residues present on the catalyst surface. It is well known that carbonaceous deposits can modify the catalytic behaviour of metal catalysts towards hydrogenolysis [25]. In our case, the experimental procedure used should ensure a \"nearly clean\" surface whereas most of the results reported in the literature have been obtained at steady-state conditions where a significant amount of carbon is likely to be present on the surface. 246 C. Crisafulli et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 The observation that selectivity to ethane depends on the Ru particle size whereas turnover frequencies are independent, could suggest that under the conditions used the rate determining step does not involve the rupture of the C-C bonds but rather the desorption of the products. In order to verify this hypothesis a kinetic study has been started. On all silicas used, addition of Cu to Ru/Si02 leads to a decrease of the overall rate of hydrogenolysis and to an increase of the selectivity towards reaction (1) . The effect on the catalytic activity of the addition of Cu to Ru is already known from the early work by Sinfelt [ 1 ] . It has been suggested that hydrogenolysis occurs on an ensemble of n adjacent Ru metal sites present at the surface, and that the catalytic activity is related to the probability of finding such ensembles. The value of n depends on the reaction investigated. The dilution of the active atoms with inert Cu causes a decrease in the fraction of Ru atoms exposed on the surface and, more important, a drastic decrease in the number of active ensembles which varies as (1-a)\" (where a is the fraction of inert copper present on the surface). The higher the value of n, the larger the effect of Cu [ 23 ] . This hypothesis could explain, at least qualitatively, the decrease of activity observed on our samples on addition of Cu as well as the increase of selectivity towards reaction (1) . It has been, in fact, reported [ 23 ] that the cracking of only one C-C bond with formation of ethane and methane (reaction (1) ) requires an ensemble of active atoms having a size nl smaller than that needed for reaction (2 ). Therefore a dilution of Ru with inert Cu would favor reaction (1), leading to an increase of the selectivity, S. If one analyzes the results of the effect of Cu on the rate of hydrogenolysis on the different silica supports (Table 3) on the basis of the above interpretation, it should be concluded that a larger dilution of the Ru surface atoms by Cu occurs on the samples prepared on the silica supports with higher surface area which in turn have a higher Ru dispersion (Table 4). It seems therefore (as will be discussed later on) that only a fraction of Ru and Cu form bimetallic aggregates and the interaction Ru-Cu is larger on the smaller Ru particles. It should also be noted that the results reported in Table 4 show that increasing the Cu/Ru ratio does not decrease the amount of exposed Ru . On the low surface area supports an increase of the CO/Ru ratio is observed. The effect of the addition of Cu on the chemisorption properties is not well established. A decrease of H2 chemisorption has been reported by some authors [ 1,8 ] as well an increase by others [ 10,22 ] . It has been proposed that the presence of chlorine and the nature of the support play an important role in determining the morphology of the Ru-Cu particles and therefore their chemisorptionbehavior [9,11]. In previous papers it has been reported that Ru-Cu samples supported on silica gel, but prepared from RuC13, show a decrease in the chemisorption properties on increasing the Cu/Ru ratio [ 5,8 ] . In our case the use of a precursor which does not contain chlorine leads to quite different behaviour. C. Crisafulli et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 247 The increase of the CO/Ru ratio observed mainly on low surface area silica could be attributed to: (i) chemisorption of CO on Cu in the presence of Ru with formation of CO bridged to Ru-Cu atoms; (ii) a greater dispersion of ruthenium obtained by the lower concentration of Ru on the sample (the total metal content is constant). Formation of CO bridged to Ru-Cu has been suggested by Sakakini et al. [ 17 ] on the basis of SIMS results. However, we believe that in our case such an effect is not very important. In fact, in the case of Ru-Cu samples supported on higher surface area silica on which the CO/Ru ratio on the monometallic Ru samples is already close to 1, no drastic increase in the relative CO uptake is observed. The presence of CO bonded to Cu should lead to a CO/Ru ratio much higher than 1 especially on the Cu richest samples. The hypothesis that at the highest Cu/Ru ratios the average metal particle size decreases, has been confirmed by a TEM analysis of the samples supported on silica A (Fig. 4). On the Ru-Cu samples, the metal particles are significantly smaller than those observed on the monometallic Ru/Si02 catalysts. This would imply that the amount of Cu covering the Ru surface atoms is small and not sufficient to give an appreciable decrease of the CO adsorption. This is also the case for the Ru-Cu samples with higher dispersions which do not show any significant change in the CO chemisorption on addition of Cu. It can be therefore suggested that under the conditions used in this work the amount of bimetallic Ru-Cu clusters formed is small and that most of the Cu (especially on the Cu richest samples) is present as separate aggregates. The presence of separated Cu particles is confirmed by the TPR-2 spectra of the Cu rich samples which show a peak in a temperature range where isolated copper oxides are reduced (Fig. 2 ). Keeping in mind that the amount of Cu interacting with Ru is likely to be very small, the data of Tables 3 and 4 show that correlation exists between the degree of Ru-Cu interaction and the surface area of the supports. Since on the supports with larger surface area smaller Ru particles are formed (Table 2 ), it can be suggested that on the smaller particles a larger amount of Cu interacts with Ru. This can be explained if one assumes that the Ru sites which have a higher tendency of bonding to Cu atoms are those located at crystallographic positions where the coordination number of Ru is smaller. This is in agreement with published results [ 14,26 ] which show that in the Ru-Cu system, the Cu atoms tend to preferentially populate low coordination, defect-like edge and corner sites of the supported metal crystallites. A preferential occupancy of edge and corner sites of Ru particles by Sn or Pb has been also proposed by Coq et al. [27]. Smale and King [14] have also suggested that the main effect of Cu on the catalytic activity of Ru towards hydrogenolysis reactions is that of blocking the low coordination sites which are responsible for hydrogen desorption from the surface. This would increase the effective concentration of hydrogen on the basal planes of ruthenium and therefore would decrease the rate of propane hydrogenolysis, which is known to have a negative order with 248 C.

An increase in the hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface would also favor the desorption of the intermediate species with the inhibition of higher multiple scission reactions. This would result, in our case, in a selectivity towards reaction (1) . The higher tendency of the smaller particles to form bimetallic aggregates was also confirmed by the results obtained on the sample SE020NH (Tables 3 C. Crisafulli et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 237-250 249 and 4) - which was prepared with a higher total metal loading. The amount of Ru and Cu used was such to obtain a metal concentration per unit of total surface area and a Cu/Ru ratio similar to that of the sample SB020N. The two samples which now have similar chemisorption properties also have similar catalytic activity. Conclusions The results obtained on the Ru-Cu/Si02 samples prepared on supports with different total surface area have shown that: (a) on the monometallic Ru/Si02 catalysts the specific catalytic activity is independent of the Ru particle size, whereas a higher selectivity to reaction (1) is observed on the samples with smaller particles; (b) addition of Cu to Ru/Si02 decreases the catalytic activity and increases the reaction selectivity. The largest variations are observed on the support with larger surface area; (c) no decrease of the CO/Ru ratio is observed on addition of Cu; (d) on silica with different surface area, samples having the same Ru/Cu ratio and similar metal concentration per unit surface area (S13020N and SE020NH) show similar results. It is suggested that most of the added Cu forms separate aggregates and only a small fraction interacts with the Ru particles to give Ru-Cu bimetallic aggregates. On the smaller particles, which are mainly formed on the supports with higher surface area, a larger amount of Cu is bonded to the Ru surface. This is likely to be due to the higher tendency of the Cu atoms of populating low coordination sites. Acknowledgement The authors thank Dr. G. Neri for electron microscopy experiments.

The catalytic properties have been tested in the hydrogenolysis of propane. Ruthenium and copper salts which do not contain chlorine have been used for catalyst preparation. The surface area of the supports used ranged from 25 to 500 m2/g. The Cu/Ru atomic ratio was varied between 0 and 4. Addition of Cu decreases the catalytic activity and increases the selectivity to ethane. The largest variations are observed on the support with larger surface area.
