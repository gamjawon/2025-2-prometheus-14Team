In the field of catalyst design, machine learning is gaining significant attention, especially in situations where data is limited. Facing this challenge, we have developed a neural network model that enhances predictive accuracy through the careful selection of catalyst descriptors and feature engineering, aiming to predict the conversion rate and selectivity of the acetylene semi-hydrogenation reaction. Our model has identified promising metal oxide catalysts, such as CuO, ZnO, and V2O5, for the acetylene semi-hydrogenation reaction, and these predictions have been experimentally validated. Among them, CuO achieved an acetylene conversion of 99.6 % and an ethylene selectivity of 90 % at 50–100°C, which is unprecedented at the reaction space velocity we tested. This high activity at relatively low temperatures indicates a more promising industrial application. Looking ahead, machine learning will play a pivotal role in catalyst design, accelerating the discovery and industrial application of new materials.

Simultaneously, some scholars have begun to explore the combination of ML with high-throughput experimental data, especially employing methods like random forests, to predict the catalytic performance of different catalysts in specific reactions [13–18]. Undoubtedly, ML holds great promise for catalyst design, with the potential to rapidly advance the development of the catalysis industry through efficient catalyst screening. However, there is a critical gap in the application of ML in catalysis, particularly in scenarios where high-throughput experimental data is scarce or difficult to obtain. While ML models have been successfully applied to reactions with abundant experimental data, such as ammonia synthesis, they face significant challenges when applied to novel reactions with insufficient data. This limitation is further compounded by variations in experimental setups, catalyst synthesis protocols, and reaction conditions, making it difficult to develop reliable ML models in the early stages of research. Identifying catalytic reaction descriptors contributes to constructing more accurate supervised ML models [19]. Alkyne semihydrogenation is an important type of chemical reaction in the chemical industry, where alkynes react with hydrogen under appropriate conditions and catalysis to produce alkenes. This reaction typically occurs at certain pressures and temperatures, with commonly used catalysts including metals like palladium, rhodium, and copper, or their alloys [20–24]. In light of these challenges, our study addresses the need for ML screening schemes that can function effectively with limited data. Specifically, we focus on the alkyne semihydrogenation reaction catalyzed by metal oxides—a reaction of considerable industrial importance. This reaction converts alkynes into alkenes, facilitating the synthesis of bulk chemical products and offering a solution for removing acetylene gas from ethylene streams, thereby preventing catalyst poisoning in ethylene production processes. However, the number of metal oxide catalysts that have been studied for this reaction is currently limited. Therefore, our work aims to fill this gap by developing a ML approach that leverages a limited dataset to select descriptors for metal oxide catalysts and predict their performance in alkyne semihydrogenation reactions. This approach not only addresses the current limitations in catalyst screening but also provides a valuable tool for researchers working with novel or less-studied reactions. 2 ML methods ML refers to the process of mapping input datasets to output targets or recognizing typical information in data through predictive models. Essentially, it is a process of gradually converging to mimic human recognition abilities through continuous fitting. Generally, high-throughput big data or initial data containing complex features enable ML to achieve automated, reliable, economical, and time-saving computation and prediction[25,26]. ML can be divided into supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves predicting model fitting based on the given mapping targets for each set of input data, while unsupervised learning involves clustering learning processes. Since this paper adopts the approach of predicting with a small amount of initial data, the task of ML becomes extremely challenging. However, research in this area is highly important because not all experiments can be conducted in a high-throughput manner. With a limited amount of data, to improve prediction accuracy, we did not use random forest methods suitable for high-throughput learning but instead employed a simple multilayer perceptron model based on neural networks. To avoid overfitting, the neural network was set to have three hidden layers, one input layer, and one output layer (as shown in Fig. 1), utilizing linear transformation propagation (Eq. 1) and RuLE function activation (Eq. 2)[27,28]. (1) L out=L in W T+b Lin represents the input layer for linear transformation propagation, while Lout represents the output layer after linear transformation propagation. W T denotes the transpose of the weight matrix, and b represents the bias term. (2) ReLU(z)=max(0,z) When aiming for high prediction accuracy with a limited amount of data, the cost involves the need to select more features, making the task of feature engineering more challenging. Selecting and constructing appropriate catalyst descriptors become more crucial than model construction itself [29–31]. Suitable descriptors can provide more information and assist the model in better generalizing to new data. We primarily employ the correlation coefficient method and the multi-class F-score method (Eq. 3) to select suitable descriptors, with the multi-class F-score method serving as the primary criterion for selection. (3) F − score = SSB / ( k − 1 ) S SW / ( n − k ) SSB (Between-group sum of squares): Represents the sum of squares between groups.SSW (Within-group sum of squares): Represents the sum of squares within groups.k: Number of categories.n: Total number of samples.(Applicable to corresponding feature values) With a limited amount of data, issues like overfitting are prone to occur. Therefore, cross-validation and regularization are necessary. In this work, we enhance the robustness of the model by adopting leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The process involves using one sample from the original data as the test set and the remaining samples as the training set, repeating this process until all samples have been traversed. Regularization, specifically L2 regularization, is employed to prevent model overfitting and improve generalization ability. 3 Neural network construction A multilayer perceptron model was adopted, and different models with varying numbers of hidden layers were tested. For example, the prediction accuracy for conversion was 40 % with models containing one or two hidden layers, while it was 60 % with a model containing three hidden layers. Through grid search, a model achieving 80 % accuracy was obtained. In this model, the number of neurons in the input layer is n, and the number of neurons in the hidden layers is 2 n, 4 n, and n, respectively. Here, n denotes the number of selected descriptors. The output layer consists of 1 neuron. Layers are connected through linear propagation, and each node uses the ReLU activation function. The data is subjected to leave-one-out cross-validation, with the loss function being the mean squared error. The Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of lr=0.002. L2 regularization is added, and the model's training iterations per epoch are set to 1000. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using grid search. (Supplementary information 1) The test set consists of catalytic data for one randomly selected metal oxide catalyst from The first batch of metal oxide catalysts. The training set includes the remaining data. The validation set is based on ZnO data. Due to the limited amount of overall data and the complexity of the actual catalytic system, the convergence results vary in each iteration. Therefore, the model with the highest prediction accuracy for ZnO is selected as the final model to predict the catalytic performance of other metal oxides. 4 Alkyne hydrogenation reaction The catalysts used are nano-oxide catalysts directly purchased from Aladdin. The conditions for alkyne hydrogenation reaction are atmospheric pressure, with a hydrogen-to-acetylene ratio of 50:1 and an ethylene-to-acetylene ratio of 100:1. The space velocity is controlled at 1000 h-1, and the reaction temperature is adjusted within the range of 50°C to 300°C. The gas effluent is normalized using gas chromatography to calculate the proportions of each component and determine the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. All catalytic performance is based on experimental results. 5 Results and discussion The first batch of metal oxide catalysts used includes TiO2, Co3O4, NiO, CeO2, Fe2O3, SnO2, and MgO. Among them, MgO serves as a non-reactive oxide to provide the model with a sample of no catalytic activity, thus preventing the model from overestimating the reaction performance. Experimental results, as depicted in Fig. 2 (Specific data can be found in Supplementary Table 1. A total of 92 groups of data were removed from MgO, and a total of 103 groups were included after MgO.), show that for most catalysts used in the alkyne hydrogenation reaction, the acetylene conversion either continuously increases with temperature or remains at a high level. Only Fe2O3 exhibits a decrease in conversion between 230°C and 250°C. Regarding ethylene selectivity, except for metal oxide catalysts with low ethylene selectivity, we observe a bimodal trend with temperature. As the temperature increases, ethylene selectivity initially rises, then declines before rising again. In fact, among our preliminary catalysts, TiO2 has already exhibited high conversion and selectivity at elevated temperatures. For our predictions, the monotonicity of conversion is easier to predict, while the complex relationship between conversion and temperature increases the difficulty of prediction. Owing to the limited amount of data, it is impractical to directly predict accurate conversion and selectivity values. In fact, the test loss from predictions based on raw data is 0.2537, and the prediction accuracy for ZnO is even lower. Clustering is a good approach to address this issue.Therefore, we clustered selectivity and conversion as shown in Table 1. The conversion of 100 % was set into a separate category, on the one hand, because there were a large number of highly active catalysts among the catalysts tested that achieved a conversion of 100 %, and on the other hand, our goal was to screen the catalysts with the highest conversion, with the goal of removing acetylene from ethylene gas. Therefore, the final choice is based on a catalyst with a sufficiently high conversion. Selectivity is divided into three categories, and the selectivity of the vast majority of catalysts is not inherently high due to the large amount of ethylene already contained in the reaction gas feed. What's more, our selectivity calculations include over-reduced acetylene and ethylene feedstock directly consumed in the reaction. Therefore, catalysts with selectivity above 50 % can already be considered to exhibit good performance, and catalysts with selectivity of 90 % can be considered very good in our reaction system. After completing the preliminary data processing, the next step is feature engineering.In catalytic reactions, the balance between performance and selectivity in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis is a critical consideration [32,33]. Homogeneous catalysts typically exhibit high coordination with reactants at the molecular level, where the ligand-to-metal ratio significantly influences the stereoselectivity of the reaction, leading to excellent stereoselectivity and reaction efficiency. However, when transitioning to heterogeneous catalysis, the complex surface effects and reaction mechanisms may cause shifts in performance and selectivity. Given that complex substrate conditions require more extensive data, a model based on a small dataset may suffer from a significant decline in predictive accuracy due to overly complicated mechanisms. Therefore, in the selection of descriptors, it is advisable to initially screen with simpler substrate descriptors. Initially, we screened a total of 16 reaction descriptors, which can be categorized into metal property descriptors, metal oxide property descriptors, and reaction condition descriptors. The metal property descriptors include Pauling electronegativity, oxidation state, ionic radius, atomic number, electron affinity, first ionization energy, second ionization energy, and third ionization energy. The metal oxide property descriptors include band gap width, conduction band position (VS NHE), valence band position (VS NHE), nearest distance of surface metal atoms, density, formation energy, and atomic weight. (Specific data can be found in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. The data are sourced from materialsproject.org.) Due to the controlled variables in the reaction, the reaction condition descriptor only includes reaction temperature. Initially, we calculated the correlation between different descriptors, acetylene conversion, and ethylene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the descriptors most correlated with catalyst conversion are the metal's electronegativity, electron affinity, metal oxide conduction band position, and formation energy. The correlation between reaction temperature and conversion is not as significant as the influence of the properties of metal oxides on catalytic performance. Therefore, in terms of conversion, the utility of selecting appropriate catalysts outweighs selecting the appropriate temperature. Regarding selectivity, there is a higher correlation with reaction temperature, while electron affinity and an interestingly high negative correlation play a significant role here. This also reflects the seesaw effect between conversion and selectivity. Due to the completely opposite effects of the core metal's electron affinity on conversion and selectivity, it is challenging to experimentally screen for a catalyst with both high selectivity and high conversion. Thus, utilizing ML methods to uncover relationships that traditional experiments cannot discover plays a crucial role in technological advancement. Due to the limitations of correlation calculations as a tool for preliminary screening, which neglect inter-group differences, directly inferring the strength of influence of different factors from correlation values is not feasible. Therefore, we further quantified the influence of different features on selectivity and conversion using the multi-class F-score method, resulting in the F-score values table shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the factors most significantly affecting conversion are the core metal's electronegativity and catalyst formation energy, which align with the correlation calculations. These two factors have a far greater impact on the reaction than temperature. Regarding selectivity, the most influential factors are reaction temperature and electron affinity. This is because the factors influencing alkyne hydrogenation reactions include both kinetics and thermodynamics. Temperature promotes the increase in reaction rate kinetics, while electron affinity determines adsorption strength, following the Sabatier principle and affecting reaction selectivity. While temperature ranks only 11th in terms of its influence on conversion, excluding it as a necessary descriptor, given its role as the sole descriptor of reaction conditions, is evidently unreasonable. Therefore, we retain temperature as a necessary descriptor and employ a 1+n descriptor selection strategy using F-score ranking of other descriptors. For each set of catalyst descriptors, predictive models are trained. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, with a convergence target set at a mean squared error of less than 0.09, the average number of iterations required for convergence decreases as the number of selected reaction descriptors increases. This is attributed to the higher selectivity of reactions with the inclusion of more reaction descriptors. However, as the number of reaction descriptors increases, the model's complexity also increases, leading to longer computational times per round. Fortunately, due to the relatively small dataset in this study, this effect is not prominently manifested. It is observed that after reaching 8 descriptors, the change in the number of rounds required for convergence becomes relatively gradual for conversion, while for selectivity, this effect is achieved after 5 descriptors. We selected these descriptors as the final prediction model. Therefore, to pursue the robustness of the model, descriptor selection should be made when the change is relatively gradual. To further refine the number of descriptors and compare the predictive model's generalization ability, we employ it for predicting the catalytic performance of ZnO. Models with different numbers of descriptors are used to predict the catalytic performance of ZnO, and the predicted results are compared with experimental results. The results obtained, as shown in Fig. 5c and d, reveal that selecting 10 descriptors (temperature, electronegativity, formation energy, electron affinity, second ionization energy, conduction band position, third ionization energy, bandgap width, density, first ionization energy) for conversion and 8 descriptors (temperature, electron affinity, density, first ionization energy, formation energy, ionic radius, oxidation state, atomic weight) for selectivity is optimal. However, we also observe a particularly noteworthy phenomenon: even with only two descriptors (temperature, electronegativity), the conversion already exhibits good predictive capability. Therefore, we further analyze and discuss these descriptors. Electronegativity is a physical property describing an atom's ability to attract electrons. In metal oxide catalysts, the electronegativity of metals can influence their interaction with reactant molecules. Higher metal electronegativity enhances electron transfer between the metal and reactants, potentially affecting reaction rates and selectivity. The electron density of a metal may affect its ability to adsorb hydrogen atoms, thereby influencing the rate and efficiency of hydrogenation reactions. Additionally, the metal's electronegativity may also influence the acidic and basic properties of metal oxide surfaces, which are crucial for modulating catalyst activity and selectivity. Acidic sites on metal oxide surfaces can adsorb and activate reactant molecules, facilitating reactions, while basic sites can promote the dissociation of intermediates and the precipitation of products. Since the descriptors we selected are basic properties readily available rather than descriptors requiring specific characterization methods, such as surface acidity/basicity or surface crystal facets, we cannot accurately predict the reaction performance of a particular metal oxide under different conditions. Instead, our model can only be used to determine whether a certain metal oxide is a suitable catalyst for acetylene semi-hydrogenation. Fig. 6 presents the catalytic performance of various metal oxides predicted using our model. Taking zinc oxide (ZnO) as an example, our prediction indicates that at lower temperatures, both conversion and selectivity are relatively poor. However, as the temperature increases, both conversion and selectivity continually improve. At temperatures above 200°C, both parameters reach a satisfactory level, consistent with our experimental results (temperature range: 50°C-300°C). Utilizing our model, we obtained the predicted results shown in Fig. 6. It can be observed that Ag2O, CuO, PdO, Co3O4, and CoO exhibit relatively excellent acetylene hydrogenation conversion capabilities, but their selectivity is not outstanding. This aligns with our observation that balancing conversion and selectivity is challenging in this reaction. Predicted promising catalysts include ZnO, V2O5, Cr2O3, CdO at higher temperatures and CuO at lower temperatures (50–100 ℃). As shown in Fig. 7, CuO exhibits close to 100 % conversion at temperatures ranging from 500 to 300°C. Encouragingly, it demonstrates remarkably high selectivity (∼90 %) at 50–100°C, consistent with our predicted results. Such high metal oxide activity has not been reported in the past, and this outstanding performance, particularly its high activity at lower temperatures, holds significant industrial value. The high conversion (>99 %) and selectivity (>80 %) of ZnO at temperatures above 200°C also suggest its potential as a catalyst for acetylene semi-hydrogenation, suitable for high-temperature acetylene semi-hydrogenation reactions. Although the activity of V2O5 shows some disparity compared to ZnO, the use of V2O5 for semi-hydrogenation reactions has never been attempted before. It is noteworthy that in this system, alkyne accounts for only 1 % of the olefin, thus a 50 % selectivity should be considered relatively high. V2O5 remains a potential metal oxide catalyst for semi-hydrogenation reactions. It is heartening that through a small sample, we have achieved the screening of simple metal oxide catalysts for acetylene semi-hydrogenation reactions. This approach appears to be efficient and reliable. We have considered some metal oxide catalysts that have not been previously applied to hydrogenation reactions and have screened efficient CuO, ZnO catalysts, and V2O5 catalysts with potential applications. However, it is still regrettable that we find it difficult to explain the results predicted by ML, regardless of how or why they are predicted. Although the process of explaining ML remains challenging, unlike in the field of computer science, all screened feature descriptors have corresponding meanings in the field of chemistry. Our team has begun efforts to construct a new ML process to achieve efficient prediction and interpretation of catalysts. 6 Conclusion In this study, we explored a ML-based approach to predict the catalytic performance of metal oxide catalysts in the acetylene hydrogenation reaction. Despite the extremely limited dataset, we successfully established a simple yet effective neural network model and improved its predictive accuracy through the selection of appropriate catalyst descriptors and feature engineering methods. We found that factors such as metal electronegativity, electron affinity, and the formation energy of metal oxides play important roles in both conversion and selectivity. Through model predictions, we identified some potential excellent catalysts, such as CuO, ZnO, and V2O5, which exhibited outstanding, previously unreported catalytic performances under specific conditions. Experimental validation confirmed their activity, with CuO showing approximately 100 % conversion and approximately 90 % selectivity at 50–100°C, ZnO exhibiting approximately 100 % conversion and approximately 80 % selectivity at temperatures above 200°C, and V2O5 demonstrating 41 % conversion and 52 % selectivity at 275°C. The acquisition of these results is exciting and provides strong evidence for the reliability of the model we constructed. While our model achieved some success in screening metal oxide catalysts for acetylene semi-hydrogenation reactions, further model optimization and algorithm improvements are necessary to accurately predict catalytic performance under broader conditions and enhance interpretability. In the future, ML will become an essential tool for catalyst design and optimization, providing robust support for accelerating the discovery and industrial application of new materials. Finally, based on small datasets or some low-cost methods derived from literature research, the combination of machine learning approaches with more cutting-edge and forward-looking applications, such as the use of single-atom catalysts [34], will continue to advance in the future.

        "dc:description": "In the field of catalyst design, machine learning is gaining significant attention, especially in situations where data is limited. Facing this challenge, we have developed a neural network model that enhances predictive accuracy through the careful selection of catalyst descriptors and feature engineering, aiming to predict the conversion rate and selectivity of the acetylene semi-hydrogenation reaction. Our model has identified promising metal oxide catalysts, such as CuO, ZnO, and V2O5, for the acetylene semi-hydrogenation reaction, and these predictions have been experimentally validated. Among them, CuO achieved an acetylene conversion of 99.6 % and an ethylene selectivity of 90 % at 50–100°C, which is unprecedented at the reaction space velocity we tested. This high activity at relatively low temperatures indicates a more promising industrial application. Looking ahead, machine learning will play a pivotal role in catalyst design, accelerating the discovery and industrial application of new materials.",
