Tel./fax: +86 571 88273283. Highly dispersed platinum nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated on the surface of few-layered reduced graphene oxide (Pt/RGO) via direct ethylene glycol reduction of PtCl6 2− in aqueous solution. This well-defined Pt/RGO catalyst was highly selective and active for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) to corresponding cinnamyl alcohol (COL) under mild conditions. It was found that the selectivity of COL remained 85.3% at 97.8% CAL conversion in ethanol. These results could be ascribed to the well dispersed Pt NPs on RGO sheets, well dispersion of Pt/RGO in ethanol and ethanol can inhibit the generation of acetals. Graphical abstract Keywords Pt nanoparticles Graphene Hydrogenation Cinnamaldehyde 1 Introduction Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to corresponding unsaturated alcohols was studied in detail by several groups as a probe of selective activation of CC or CO bond [1–5]. At the same time, this reaction is of great importance in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceutical intermediates and also in the scientific insight of catalyst designs [1–5]. However, thermodynamic calculations indicated that hydrogenation of CC is more favorable than the activation of CO bond, and it was also found that the CC bond is more reactive than CO in reaction kinetics [6–9]. It is a challenge to design a catalyst that can perform the selective hydrogenation of CO bond versus CC bond. Significant efforts have been made in the selective hydrogenation of CO bond that is conjugated with CC bond in both homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis [10–16]. Among these progresses, the role of catalysts supports in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes was emphasized. Many kinds of materials were reported, among which metal oxides (e.g., SiO2 and Al2O3 supported Pd and Ru [17], TiO2 supported Pt and Ni [18], Au/Fe2O3 [19], Au/TiO2 [20], and Au/ZnO [6]) were the most frequently used. Carbon materials have high surface area, high stability and good electrical conductivity, and it was popularly used as supports for dispersion of metal NPs. Graphene, as one-atom-thick planar sheet of hexagonally arrayed and sp2 -hybridized carbon atoms, has attracted tremendously attentions in the areas of modern chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering [1]. It has been suggested that graphene oxide (GO) would be a promising support for metal NPs, because GO sheets not only possess larger theoretical specific surface area (up to ~2600m2 g−1) but also exhibit higher efficient utilization of surface area as both sides of the nanosheets are accessible [21]. But most published works toward the applications of graphene-based materials were focused on nano-electronic devices, such as electrodes, batteries and super-capacitors [22–24]. Herein, we want to report a RGO sheet supported Pt NPs' catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (cinnamaldehyde, CAL) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (cinnamyl alcohol, COL). At the same time, the influence reaction conditions, such as solvents were optimized. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Pt/RGO GO was prepared by oxidation of graphite according to Hummers and Offemann's method [25]. The prepared GO (with 0.25gC) was put into a mixed solution containing ethylene glycol (250mL), deionized water (50mL) and H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.010g), this mixture was further stirred for 2h to make GO fully exfoliated. And then, the mixture was transferred to a stainless steel autoclave with Teflon inner layer and put into an oil bath at 120°C for 24h under constant stirring. The formed catalyst was separated by filtration and washed with ethanol until free of Cl−. As a reference, Pt NPs deposited on AC were also prepared in same procedure, which was denoted as Pt/AC. Pt content in the prepared Pt/RGO and Pt/AC was checked via inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP, Plasma-Spec-II spectrometer). 2.2 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of GO, Pt/RGO and Pt/AC were carried out on a RIGAKUD/MAX 255/PC diffractometer at 40kV and 100mA with CuKα radiation. Raman spectra were collected on a Rhenishaw 2000 Confocal Raman Microprobe (Rhenishaw, Instruments, England) using a 514.5nm argon laser. The morphology of prepared catalysts was detected on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (TEM, JEOL-2010F) using an accelerating voltage of 200kV. N2 adsorption was measured at its normal boiling point using an ASAP 2010 analyzer (Micromeritics) after pretreated at 250°C for 4h in vacuum. Surface area and BJH pore size distribution were calculated using their adsorption isotherms. 2.3 Catalytic reaction Selective hydrogenation of CAL was carried out in a 100mL custom designed stainless autoclave with a Teflon inner layer. In a typical procedure, catalyst was first dispersed in 20.0mL solvent, and then 8.0mmoL CAL was added under stirring. The reactor was sealed, purged with purified hydrogen, pressurized to 2.0MPa and then the reactor was heated with an oil bath and stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a rate of 1000rpm (MAG-NEO, RV-06M, Japan). After reaction, solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation. The reactants were analyzed by gas chromatograph (HP 5890, USA) with a 30m capillary column (HP-5) using a flame ionization detector. All products were confirmed by GC–MS (Agilent 6890-5973N). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of GO, Pt/AC and Pt/RGO. One predominant diffraction peak at 10.8° was detected in GO, which could be attributed to the characteristic diffraction of GO (002 plane). The calculated d-spacing (0.739nm) of this plane inferred that oxygenated functional groups, such as epoxy, hydroxy (OH), carboxy (COOH), and carbonyl (CO) groups, were generated on both sides and edges of GO sheets [26]. It was found that characteristic diffraction peak (002) of GO shifted to higher angle (24.5°) and became broader in Pt/RGO (Fig. 1c), which could be attributed to that GO might be partially reduced to RGO sheets. Moreover, the diffraction peak at around 43° was associated with the (100) plane of the hexagonal structure of carbon [27]. The diffraction peaks of Pt in Pt/RGO were faint. However, significantly sharp diffraction peaks (in Fig. 1b) of Pt at around 39.7, 46.4, 67.5 and 81.3° were detected in Pt/AC, which could be assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystalline planes of face centered cubic (fcc) Pt particles, respectively. The mean average crystalline sizes of Pt in Pt/RGO and Pt/AC are 2.2 and 6.4nm, respectively, which were calculated from the broadening of Pt (220) plane using Scherrer's equation (0.089·λ/β ·cosθ, where, λ is the wavelength of X-ray, β is the width of the XRD pattern line at half peak-height (rad)). Raman spectrum of GO, Pt/RGO and Pt/AC was presented in Fig. 2 . Two prominent peaks at 1350 and 1590cm−1 were detected in GO and Pt/RGO (Fig. 2(a)), which were assigned to the disorder induced features caused by lattice defect (D) and the vibration of E2g phonons of sp2 carbon atoms (G), respectively [27]. The calculated intensity ratio of D band and G band (I(D)/I(G)) increased from 0.95 (in GO) to 1.18 (in Pt/RGO), which indicated that the insertion of Pt NPs leads to a high disorder of graphene sheets. The observed 2D band of Pt/RGO with a nearly symmetrical shape was centered at 2678cm−1, which is slightly lower than that of GO (Fig. 2(b)). This shift is associated with the reduction in Fermi velocity of stacked graphene sample with increasing layers [28] and the insertion of Pt NPs into graphene sheets. Fig. 3 shows the typical TEM images of Pt/RGO and Pt/AC (Fig. 3(c)). Large amount of highly dispersed, unique sized Pt NPs (2.0±0.5nm) were detected on the surface of few-layered RGO in Pt/RGO (with a 3.6% loading amount Pt, Fig. 3(a)). At the same time, it was believed that both surfaces of RGO sheets were accessible to Pt NPs, and these particles attached onto the surface of RGO can prevent its aggregation and restacking [29]. High resolution image of Pt/RGO (shown in Fig. 3(b)) displayed the well-defined lattice fringes of Pt NPs. And the insertion (in Fig. 3(b)) was the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a single Pt crystal on surface of RGO sheets which showed sharp spots due to well-crystallized Pt. The calculated lattice spacing values, 0.225 and 0.232nm, are corresponding to the 111 and 200 planes of a single-crystal Pt, respectively. HRTEM images also confirmed the edges of the suspended film always fold back, allowing for a cross-sectional view of the RGO sheets. The observation of these edges in HRTEM images provided an accurate way to measure the number of layers at multiple locations of the RGO sheets. Mainly 5–7 layered RGO sheets were observed in the prepared Pt/RGO catalyst in this work, and the interlayer spacing was in the range of 0.337–0.346nm, which was quite close to that of graphite. On the other hand, it was found that Pt dispersed unevenly and large agglomerated Pt particles were detected on the surface of AC (Fig. 3(c)). The detected Pt particles on AC (with a 4.0% loading amount Pt) were in the range of 2.5–11.5nm, and the calculated mean particle size reached 6.5nm. The nitrogen adsorption isothermals of RGO, Pt/RGO and Pt/AC were shown in Fig. 4 and their porosity structure were summarized in Table 1 . It was found that the surface area of Pt/AC reached 1298.5m2/g, but it is a micropore-porous material and the calculated pore diameter was smaller than 0.89nm. Both RGO and Pt/RGO are micropore-free materials, and their surface areas were 517.3 and 343.2m2/g, respectively. 3.2 Hydrogenation of CAL in different solvents Table 2 summarized the activity of Pt/RGO catalyst for the hydrogenation of CAL in different solvents. It was found that the conversion of CAL in cyclohexane, toluene, dimethyl-formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide was low, which might be attributed that reactants were poorly soluble in these solvents. The conversion of CAL increased slightly in CHCl3, ethyl acetate, CH3CN and acetone, however, the selectivity of COL was quite low. Non-selective hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds performed simultaneously in these solvents, and large amount of byproducts such as cinnamyl formate, cinnamic acid, benzyl cinnamate, β-methyl styrene and propyl benzene were detected in the reaction mixture. It was quite interesting to find that mainly COL formed in alcohol solvents and the formation of byproducts was inhibited (Table 3 ). The conversion of CAL and the selectivity of COL (in methanol) reached 80.4 and 73.7%, respectively, but some amount of CAL diacetal was detected in the reaction mixture. The conversion of CAL decreased continuously with the increasing polarity of the alcohol solvent, while the selectivity of COL increased slightly. Ethanol was the best solvent for this reaction and the selectivity of COL increased to 83.2% and no diacetal was detected. Long chain alcohols can inhibit the formation of byproducts and improve the chemoselective reduction of CO bond, but the hydrogenation rate was lower in comparison with that in methanol and ethanol. These observed trends could be attributed to the hydrogen bonding of carbonyl oxygen with hydroxyl group of the alcohols in accordance with literatures [30]. Selective hydrogenation over traditional Pt/AC catalyst and support-free Pt colloidal NPs were also conducted in order to investigate the influence of support. It was found that ethanol was the best solvent for this reaction over Pt/AC catalyst, in which the selectivity of COL reached 70.3% (and the conversion of CAL is 20.1%) (see entry 9–12 in Table 3). While the activity of support-free Pt colloidal NPs in ethanol solvent was lower (with a 11.5% conversion) than that of Pt/RGO and Pt/AC (see entry 13 in Table 3). These results indicated that the support played important roles in both improving catalytic activity of Pt NPs and the selectivity towards desired product. The advantages of Pt/RGO can be attributed to that Pt NPs dispersed highly on RGO (see Fig. 3a), higher mesopore volume and micropore-free structure of Pt/RGO (see Table 1 and Fig. 4) and the well dispersion of Pt/RGO in reaction mixture (as shown in Fig. S1 in supplementary data). At the same time, Yang et al. reported that the plane conjugated aromatic compounds can be quickly adsorbed on graphene due to the π-character of carbon network, and this unique property might protect benzene ring and CC bond but expose CO bond to active sites for activation [31]. Fig. 5 shows the time course of CAL hydrogenation over Pt/RGO in ethanol solvent. It was found that the conversion of CAL increased continuously with the prolonged reaction time, the selectivity of COL increased slightly from 78.6 (at 0.5h) to 85.3% (4.0h). It was quite interesting to note that the selectivity of HCAL decreased from 14.5 to 2.8% with the increasing time and the selectivity of HCOL increased from 6.9 to 12.0%. These results indicated that HCOL forms mainly from the further hydrogenation of HCAL over Pt/RGO in ethanol solvent. 4 Conclusion In this work, it was found that highly dispersed Pt NPs could be fabricated on the surface of RGO via a direct ethylene glycol reduction of PtCl6 2− in aqueous solution. Pt/RGO exhibited higher performance for selective hydogenation of CO group in CAL than Pt/AC and support-free Pt colloidal NPs, and ethanol is the best solvent for this reaction. The prominent activity of Pt/RGO was contributed to highly dispersed Pt NPs, micropore free structure of Pt/RGO and well dispersion of Pt/RGO in reaction mixture.
