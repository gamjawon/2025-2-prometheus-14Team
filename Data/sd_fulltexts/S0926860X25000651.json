Herein, we present a sol-gel-assisted self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) strategy that integrates sol-gel formation, self-combustion, and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis into a one pot process, enabling efficient and rapid synthesis of metal oxide-based composites. As a demonstration, we synthesized easily separable magnetic Fe₃O₄/C composites and conducted a catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction of furfural (FAL), a representative biomass-derived carbonyls, achieving superior activity at mild conditions. The high specific surface area and abundant acid-base sites endow the substrate and catalyst with strong interactions and bonding, thereby promoting the hydrogen transfer process. The direct hydrogen transfer pathway of the CTH reaction was confirmed using isotope labeling, alongside the elucidation of the side reaction.

Biomass, being abundant and renewable, offers a wide range of platform molecules that can be upgraded into high-value products through catalytic processes [5,6]. Among these, furfural, derived from the dehydration of pentose sugars, is a promising biomass-derived intermediate with significant potential for further transformation into biofuels and chemicals [7,8]. Furfural can be hydrogenated to produce furfuryl alcohol, which has applications in the production of resins, plastics, and biofuels, offering a sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived compounds [9–11]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) provides an efficient route for converting furfural into furfuryl alcohol, utilizing formic acid or alcohols as hydrogen sources, which eliminates the need for molecular H₂ and enhances the safety and sustainability of the process [12–15]. This approach enhances safety and sustainability by eliminating the need for molecular hydrogen. The performance of CTH heavily depends on the catalyst, which influences both efficiency and selectivity [16,17]. Recently, composite catalysts have gained attention due to their high active site density, structural stability, and tunable properties [8,18,19], as shown in Table S1. Currently, the synthesis of composite catalysts primarily relies on methods such as sol-gel, co-precipitation, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal synthesis. For instance, the co-precipitation method is often used to prepare uniformly dispersed metal oxide composite catalysts, while hydrothermal synthesis allows for precise control over the microstructure [20–24]. However, these traditional methods typically face challenges, including high temperature requirements, long reaction times, or difficulties in precisely controlling particle morphology. As a result, there has been a growing focus on developing more efficient synthesis methods to streamline production and improve physical and chemical properties. One such method is self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), a highly efficient technique that has attracted attention for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and potential to overcome many of the drawbacks of traditional methods [25–27]. SHS relies on exothermic reactions between reactants, where the heat generated sustains the reaction, enabling rapid synthesis of target materials. It is particularly well-suited for the preparation of metal oxides, nitrides, and composites, offering advantages such as low energy consumption, fast reaction rates, and scalability [28–30]. SHS methods can be categorized based on the form of the starting materials, including solid-phase SHS, liquid-phase SHS, gas-phase SHS, and multiphase SHS [31–33]. In some cases, SHS can be combined with other synthesis methods, such as the sol-gel technique. In this approach, the sol-gel process is first used to produce a uniform precursor, and then SHS is employed to initiate a high-temperature reaction, leading to the rapid formation of the target material [34,35]. This combination allows for precise control over the composition of the precursor while benefiting from the fast reaction rates and high temperatures of SHS. It is a versatile method used for the synthesis of various complex materials. For example, Wu et al. employed this method to synthesize Cu/CuFe₂O₄ composites, where adjusting the ratio of citric acid to iron nitrate allowed for fine control over Cu content, significantly enhancing electromagnetic wave absorption [36]. Similarly, Hu et al. used sol-gel combustion to prepare Y₂O₃-supported nickel catalysts, achieving high metal dispersion and 100 % ammonia conversion at optimal conditions [37]. These studies highlight the versatility of SHS in improving both material properties and synthesis efficiency. Herein, an innovative sol-gel-assisted SHS method was developed, in which the sol-gel formation, self-combustion and SHS processes were simultaneously carried out in a one-pot approach at a low temperature of 140/170 °C. This method allows for the efficient, energy-saving, and rapid synthesis of Fe₃O₄/C, Ni-NiO/C, Cu₂O-CuO/C, and Mn₃O₄/C composites. Among them, the easily separable magnetic Fe₃O₄/C catalyst demonstrated superior catalytic activity for the CTH reaction of biomass-derived carbonyls, reaching hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) at 150 °C for 5 h. Detailed experimental analysis revealed that the abundant acid-base sites on Fe₃O₄/C promote strong interactions with substrate molecules, driving alcohol dissociation and carbonyl group activation. Isotope labeling further elucidates the catalytic mechanism and the sources of side reactions. These findings offer valuable guidance for tuning the catalytic performance and properties of various composites with expanded functionality using this innovative sol-gel-assisted SHS method. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Fe₃O₄/C composites were synthesized using a sol-gel-assisted SHS method. Specifically, 12 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 12 mmol of citric acid were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring. This solution was then placed in an oven at 140 °C, where it underwent three sequential processes: sol-gel formation, self-combustion, and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis. The resulting sample was thoroughly washed and separated multiple times to eliminate unburned gel residues, and the Fe₃O₄/C composite material was obtained after drying. Similarly, Ni-NiO/C, Cu₂O-CuO/C, and Mn₃O₄/C composites were synthesized using the same procedure, with the oven temperatures set to 140, 170, and 170 °C, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity study All the catalytic activity study can be found in Supporting Information. 2.3 Catalyst characterization All characterizations are available in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation mechanism of composites The composites were fabricated using a sol-gel-assisted SHS method ( Fig. 1a), following a one-pot process that includes three sequential stages: sol-gel formation, self-combustion, and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, driven by a hypothermic-induced self-sustaining redox reaction. Once the xerogel network is formed, the combustion reaction is initiated at the same temperature, with the heat generated sustaining the redox process, allowing the combustion to propagate along the xerogel network structure. Various nitrates were selected for synthesis based on their oxidizing abilities (Fe(NO3)3 > Cu(NO3)2 > Co(NO3)2 > Ni(NO3)2 > Mn(NO3)2 > Al(NO3)3 > Mg(NO3)2), which significantly influenced whether the xerogels would undergo combustion. Experiments showed that xerogels synthesized with Co(NO₃)₂, Al(NO₃)₃, and Mg(NO₃)₂ did not combust even at 200 °C and dissolved after washing. The failure of the xerogel synthesized with Co(NO₃)₂ to combust was particularly notable, likely attributed to the unique d⁷ electron configuration of Co, which facilitates the formation of a stable coordination complex with citric acid [38,39], thereby preventing combustion. To investigate this further, xerogel precursors were synthesized at 120 °C and analyzed via Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis to better understand the underlying mechanism (Figure S1 and S2). FT-IR spectra indicated that the structures of the precursors were largely identical, suggesting that differences in the final outcomes were due to variations in composition and structural stability. TG analysis revealed significant weight loss and endothermic or exothermic peaks below 200 °C, indicating the onset of the redox reaction within this temperature range. The weight loss of Fe-based and Ni-based precursors is higher than that of Cu-based and Mn-based precursors. A greater weight loss indicates a more intense reaction and higher heat release. As a result, Fe₃O₄/C and Ni-NiO/C are synthesized at 140 °C, while Cu₂O-CuO/C and Mn₃O₄/C are synthesized at 170 °C. The smaller weight loss observed in the Co-based precursor suggests that the reaction was insufficient to trigger the next stage of skeletal decomposition (∼300 °C). In contrast, the Mn-based precursor, despite similar weight loss, underwent smooth self-combustion due to its lower second-stage decomposition temperature (∼250 °C) and a continuous endothermic-exothermic process from 140 °C to 230 °C. Thus, the intensity of the redox reaction is crucial for driving the sol-gel-assisted SHS process. Additionally, during the process, reducing atmospheres such as CO, CH₄, and H₂ are generated, promoting the formation of Ni-NiO and Cu₂O-CuO composites in an air atmosphere. These reducing conditions also inhibit the oxidation of Fe₃O₄ to Fe₂O₃, preserving its structure. 3.2 Structural characterization of composites The morphology of the samples was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although the TEM images did not reveal any distinctive morphology for the Fe₃O₄/C composite (Fig. 1b), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis showed lattice spacings of 0.297 nm and 0.253 nm, corresponding to the (220) and (311) crystal planes of Fe₃O₄, respectively (Fig. 1c). The crystal axis [112] was confirmed through selected area electron diffraction via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Additionally, lattice spacing indicative of carbon was observed adjacent to Fe₃O₄ (Fig. 1c and S3). Local enlargement of the HRTEM image showed that the primary structure of the material is carbon, with Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles loaded onto the carbon. In the case of Ni-NiO/C, Cu₂O-CuO/C, and Mn₃O₄/C composites, further examination of the TEM images revealed small particles organized in an irregular morphology (Figures S4, S5, and S6). HRTEM images and FFT patterns of these regions confirmed the successful synthesis of the respective composites. However, unlike Fe₃O₄/C, the presence of carbon was not clearly detected, likely due to the low-crystallinity of carbon at the grain boundaries of the particle aggregates, making it difficult to observe in TEM. The crystal structures of the composites were further analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman spectra, and FT-IR spectra. The XRD pattern of Fe₃O₄/C is attributed to the cubic spinel structure (JCPDS Card No. 19–0629) ( Fig. 2a). The XRD patterns for the other samples indicate their respective crystal structures: Ni-NiO/C shows both the cubic nickel structure (JCPDS Card No. 04–0850) and the cubic rock salt structure (JCPDS Card No. 47–1049), while Cu₂O-CuO/C corresponds to the cubic antifluorite structure (JCPDS Card No. 05–0667) and the monoclinic structure (JCPDS Card No. 45–0937). Finally, Mn₃O₄/C is identified as having a tetragonal spinel structure (JCPDS Card No. 24–0734). These findings are consistent with the HRTEM images and FFT analysis discussed earlier. The Raman spectra of all composites exhibited two prominent carbon peaks (Fig. 2b): the D band at ∼1345 cm⁻¹, associated with defective graphene or disordered carbon, and the G band at ∼1589 cm⁻¹, corresponding to graphitic layers [40,41]. These peaks indicate a substantial presence of carbon species in the composites. In the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2c), the peaks between 1000 and 1800 cm⁻¹ are attributed to C–OH, CC, and C–H bond vibrations, further confirming the presence of carbon. Peaks below 1000 cm⁻¹ correspond to the stretching vibrations of metal-oxygen (metal-O) bonds, while the peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ is linked to the stretching vibrations of O–H bond [42,43]. Additionally, CHNS elemental analysis provides direct evidence of carbon content (Table S2). To investigate the surface properties of the prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed (Figure S7 and S8). The C 1 s spectra showed binding energies of 284.6 eV, 285.8 eV, and 288.2 eV (Figure S7a), corresponding to C–C/CC, C–O, and CO groups, respectively. The O 1 s spectra was deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.9 eV, 531.4 eV, and 532.9 eV (Figure S7b), representing metal-bound oxygen, C–O/C=O groups, and surface-adsorbed water, respectively [44,45]. These results align with the FT-IR spectra, further confirming the presence of abundant carbon species in the samples. Additionally, analysis of the metal spectra (Fe 2p, Ni 2p, Cu 2p, and Mn 2p) revealed that each composite contains at least two metal species in different valence states (Figure S8). This multiplicity in valence states enhances electron density regulation and facilitates the formation of diverse configurations, ultimately improving catalytic activity and selectivity. 3.3 Investigation of substrate-catalyst surface chemistry The specific surface area and acid-base site concentration of a catalyst are critical for activating substrate molecules during the CTH reaction [7,46,47]. Therefore, we first compared the relevant properties of all composite materials. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm is presented in Figure S9. All samples exhibit type IV isotherms with H3-type or H4-type hysteresis loops. The absence of pronounced saturated adsorption platforms in these hysteresis loops indicates a highly irregular pore structure, likely due to the mesoporous nature of the interconnected nanoparticles. Among the samples, Fe₃O₄/C demonstrates the highest specific surface area at 138.9 m²/g, significantly surpassing Ni-NiO/C (46.2 m²/g), Cu₂O-CuO/C (29.7 m²/g), and Mn₃O₄/C (59.0 m²/g) (Table S2). Additionally, NH₃/CO₂ temperature programmed desorption (TPD) tests revealed that Fe₃O₄/C possesses acid and base site concentrations of 2.52 mmol/g and 1.82 mmol/g, respectively, both of which are notably higher than those of the other composites ( Fig. 3c and S10). This combination of elevated specific surface area and acid-base site concentration greatly enhances the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules on the Fe₃O₄/C composite. Attenuated total reflectance-infrared (ATR-IR) spectra was further employed to characterize the surface activity between the substrate and catalyst, highlighting the advantages of Fe₃O₄/C in substrate activation. The peak of the CO bonds for pure FAL was observed at 1668 cm⁻¹(Fig. 3a). Upon adsorption onto the surface of the composites, the CO bonds of Fe₃O₄/C exhibited the largest red shift, indicating a strong interaction with the CO bonds. In contrast, the red shifts observed for Ni-NiO/C, Cu₂O-CuO/C, and Mn₃O₄/C were progressively weaker. Notably, no shifts were detected for the peaks at 1568 and 1463 cm⁻¹ corresponding to CC bonds on the furan ring, suggesting that the catalyst primarily interacted with the CO bonds of FAL, aligning perpendicularly to the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the O-H bonds of Fe3O4/C also showed the most obvious red shift (Fig. 3b), revealing that the strong interaction between the catalyst and the O–H bonds in 2-propanol (2-PrOH) reduces the energy of the O–H bonds. These adsorption results demonstrate stronger interactions and bonding between substrate and Fe₃O₄/C compared to the other composites. 3.4 Reaction evaluations toward CTH reaction The CTH reaction is an important process for producing high-value chemicals from biomass-derived carbonyl compounds [11,16]. In this study, furfural (FAL) was selected as a representative compound to evaluate the catalytic performance of Fe₃O₄/C synthesized via the sol-gel-assisted SHS method. The CTH reaction of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) was conducted at 150 °C for 4 h over various composite catalysts ( Fig. 4a). Among the catalysts tested, Fe₃O₄/C exhibited superior catalytic activity, achieving an 84.9 % yield, attributed to its high specific surface area, abundant acid-base sites, and strong interaction with substrate molecules. The effects of reaction temperature and time on Fe₃O₄/C performance were further explored (Fig. 4b), revealing that both conversion and yield increased with rising temperature and extended reaction time. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of Fe₃O₄/C was compared with that of other materials (Table S3). It was observed that pure Fe₃O₄ exhibited lower performance than Fe₃O₄/C, and the performance of the impregnation-synthesized Fe₃O₄/C-p was even worse. This suggests that the sol-gel-assisted SHS method effectively dispersed and loaded Fe₃O₄ onto carbon, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance. Additionally, a further comparison with FeCx, Cu/CuFe₂O₄, and Ni/Y₂O₃ revealed that the catalytic performance of these materials was significantly inferior to that of the Fe₃O₄-based catalysts. However, Cu/CuFe₂O₄ and Ni/Y₂O₃ samples, synthesized using a similar sol-gel-assisted SHS method, exhibited relatively good performance. This improvement may be attributed to the rapid combustion process, which results in smaller grain sizes and a higher density of active sites. Additionally, the applicability of Fe₃O₄/C for CTH reactions was evaluated across various substrates (Table S4), including biomass-derived carbonyl compounds as well as representative aldehydes and ketones, efficiently converting these substrates into the corresponding alcohols. The magnetic properties of the Fe₃O₄/C and Ni-NiO/C composites were evaluated utilizing a superconducting quantum interference device-vibrating sample magnetometer (SQUID-VSM) (Figure S11). The magnetization hysteresis curves showed minimal remanence and coercivity, indicating strong superparamagnetic behavior, consistent with previous reports [19]. The magnetic saturation values for both composites were ∼20–27 emu/g. Especially, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, Fe₃O₄/C could be rapidly separated from the reaction mixture employing an external magnet without the need for complicated filtration or centrifugation. This property underscores its practicality as a magnetic catalyst. The reusability and heterogeneity of the magnetic Fe₃O₄/C catalyst were assessed through recycling and leaching experiments. Fe₃O₄/C demonstrated excellent reusability, preserving catalytic activity for at least 10 cycles. After each cycle, the spent catalyst was easily recovered utilizing a magnet, washed three times with ethanol, and then dried for subsequent use. Moreover, the spent catalyst exhibited ultrastable physicochemical properties, as illustrated in Figure S12 and Table S5, confirming its robustness during the reaction. To further investigate the heterogeneous characteristics of Fe₃O₄/C, we set up two parallel experiments: one in which the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture after 2 h, and another in which the catalyst remained in the mixture throughout the reaction (Fig. 4d). In the absence of the catalyst, no reaction occurred, and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis showed no detectable Fe species in the filtrate, confirming that metal ions from the catalyst were not leached. These results validate the heterogeneity and stability of Fe₃O₄/C. Iron-based oxides and composites are recognized as effective catalysts for the CTH reactions using alcohols as hydrogen donors. As presented in Table S6, various catalysts have been reported for the CTH reaction of furfural (FAL). Notably, all reported catalysts, except for the Fe₃O₄ and Zr-based MOF composite (Fe₃O₄@Zr-FDCA) [19], operate under reaction conditions exceeding 160 °C. These harsh conditions may be attributed to the limited exposure of unsaturated and acid-base sites in these catalysts. To address this limitation, Fe₃O₄/C was synthesized using a sol-gel-assisted SHS method. This catalyst features a high specific surface area, abundant acid-base sites, and strong interactions with substrate molecules, enabling effective CTH reaction of FAL at temperatures below 150 °C. Fe₃O₄ demonstrates high catalytic activity, and its dispersion on carbon further enhances its performance, allowing efficient transfer hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures. In contrast to other catalysts, which require higher temperatures to compensate for poor exposure of active sites or weak substrate interactions, the Fe₃O₄/C catalyst maintains strong catalytic activity at lower temperatures. The sol-gel-assisted SHS method plays a crucial role by ensuring a stable, well-dispersed structure that minimizes aggregation and maximizes catalytic efficiency, making Fe₃O₄/C an attractive catalyst for the CTH reaction. 3.5 Mechanistic insights based on isotopically label Efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions are known to require the activation of CO bond in reactants and O-H bond in alcohols (as hydrogen donors) [47,48]. In metal oxide-based catalysts, such as Fe₃O₄/C discussed in this study, metal ions act as Lewis acid sites, crucial for activating the CO bond, while adjacent oxygen ions function as Lewis base sites to activate the O-H bond in hydrogen sources, thereby facilitating hydrogen transfer. Specifically, the Lewis acid sites readily interact with the electron-rich oxygen in 2-PrOH and the CO bond of FAL, while the adjacent base sites attract protons from the hydroxyl group, weakening the O–H bond in 2-PrOH, as demonstrated in other systems [8,49,50]. Despite this foundational understanding, the catalytic mechanism of the CTH reaction involving Fe₃O₄/C—particularly whether it involves direct or indirect hydrogen transfer—remains unclear. To investigate this mechanism, an isotope-labeled 2-PrOH-d₈ GC-MS method was employed; however, substituting 2-PrOH-d₀ with 2-PrOH-d₈ did not delineate the differences between direct and indirect hydrogen transfer. Consequently, to further elucidate the hydrogen transfer process, a 1:3 mixture of 2-PrOH-d₈ and t-BuOH was utilized. Although t-BuOH lacks β-H and does not act as a hydrogen donor, it can exchange hydrogen atoms with the predominant OD₁ groups of 2-PrOH-d₈ and the deuterium hydrogen bonds (M-D) of the metal, resulting in the formation of OH and M-H, respectively. This OH formation generates 2-PrOH-d₇, which serves as the primary hydrogen donor for the CTH reaction of FAL ( Fig. 5d). The desired alcohols should exhibit a 1 amu MS shift (MS + 1 = 99) in the case of direct hydrogen transfer, or no shift (MS + 0 = 98) for indirect hydrogen transfer. As expected, the MS analysis unequivocally confirmed a 1 amu mass shift, validating the transformation of FAL to FOL over Fe₃O₄/C via the direct hydrogen transfer pathway (Fig. 5a). In the reaction conducted with 2-PrOH-d8+t-butanol solvent, the byproducts furfuryl isopropyl ether (FE) and 2-(diisopropyloxymethyl) furan (DIPF) exhibited mass shifts of 8 amu (MS + 8 = 148) (Fig. 5b) and 14 amu (MS + 14 = 212) (Fig. 5c), respectively. The acidic properties of Fe₃O₄/C are primarily attributed to the Lewis acid provided by Fe and the Brønsted acid formed by carbon through redox reactions, which together contribute to the occurrence of minor side reactions. In the case of FE formation (Fig. 5d), FOL obtained by FAL hydrogenation is protonated with the relevant Bronsted acidic proton, which then attacks the electrophilic a-carbon and squeezes out water, followed by deprotonation to form FE. FOL can also coordinate with the Lewis acid Fe site, thereby enhancing its electrophilicity and allowing the OH of 2-PrOH to undergo nucleophilic attack to form FE and release water [51,52]. As a result, the etherification reaction of FOL with 2-PrOH-d7 shows a shift of 8 amu. Similarly, the formation of DIPF occurs via the acetalization of FAL with 2-PrOH-d₇ (Fig. 5d). The low selectivity observed in this reaction is due to the strong hydrogen-donating capacity and steric hindrance of 2-PrOH. The process can be outlined as follows: the polar aldehyde group of FAL reacts readily with nucleophiles because of the electropositivity of the carbon atom. The nucleophilic oxygen from the hydroxyl group in the alcohol attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a hemiacetal. The unstable -OH group in the hemiacetal readily dehydrates and condenses with another alcohol molecule to produce an acetal [53,54]. Consequently, the acetalization reaction of FAL with 2-PrOH-d₇ results in a 14 amu shift, and deuterium isotope tracing provides a detailed understanding of these two common side reaction pathways. 4 Conclusions In summary, we developed an innovative sol-gel-assisted SHS method that integrates sol-gel formation, self-combustion, and high-temperature synthesis into a one pot process conducted at low temperature of 140/170 °C. This approach enables the efficient, energy-saving, and rapid synthesis of various metal oxide-based composites, including Fe₃O₄/C, Ni-NiO/C, Cu₂O-CuO/C, and Mn₃O₄/C. With the easily separable magnetic Fe₃O₄/C as the best, the synthesized composites demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance in CTH reactions with biomass-derived carbonyls, particularly achieving a yield of 91.7 % for FOL from FAL at 150 °C for 5 h. The enhanced specific surface area and rich acid-base sites of Fe₃O₄/C facilitate strong interactions and bonding between the substrate and catalyst, effectively promoting the hydrogen transfer process. Isotope labeling experiments provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism, confirming a direct hydrogen transfer pathway and elucidating common side reaction pathways. This novel synthesis method not only optimizes the production process but also expands the applicability of metal oxide composites in catalysis.

        "dc:description": "Developing an efficient, energy-saving, and rapid synthesis method for composites is crucial for advancing functional catalytic materials, yet still challenging. Herein, we present a sol-gel-assisted self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) strategy that integrates sol-gel formation, self-combustion, and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis into a one pot process, enabling efficient and rapid synthesis of metal oxide-based composites. As a demonstration, we synthesized easily separable magnetic Fe₃O₄/C composites and conducted a catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction of furfural (FAL), a representative biomass-derived carbonyls, achieving superior activity at mild conditions. The high specific surface area and abundant acid-base sites endow the substrate and catalyst with strong interactions and bonding, thereby promoting the hydrogen transfer process. The direct hydrogen transfer pathway of the CTH reaction was confirmed using isotope labeling, alongside the elucidation of the side reaction. These findings offer new insights for the synthesis of metal oxide-based composites and broaden the applicability of the sol-gel-assisted SHS strategy in material synthesis.",
