Summary Carbon monoxide hydrogenation has been investigated over superbasic and superbase-ferrous metal catalysts. The superbasic systems were obtained by evaporation of alkali metals onto the A1203 surface and the 'bifunctional' catalysts by the action of alkali metal vapours on previously reduced transi- tion metals on alumina. A shift of activity was observed in the direction of alkenes and longer carbon chains when compared with the pure first triad metal-supported catalysts. The surface species formed upon adsorption of CO and subsequent reaction with hydrogen were investigated using IR and ESR spectroscopies. In the IR spectra of alkali metal-doped nickel and cobalt catalysts, new bands derived from the adsorption of CO on the alkali metal generated states were observed, as well as basic changes in the adsorp- tion region characteristic for transition metals. ESR spectroscopy revealed the presence of paramagnetic surface species after CO adsorption and subse- quent reaction with H^ on the superbasic and bimetallic catalyst surfaces. Introduction m our previous work we demonstrated the method of preparation of catalysts exhibiting uncommonly strong one-electron donor properties [1-3]. The catalytic systems obtained, which could be likened to the so- called superbases, are formed by evaporation of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals onto the surface of inorganic oxides such as MgO, A1203 or Si02. As was shown, the reaction of metal vapours with surface anion vacancies of the oxide resulted in the formation of color centres of the F^\"- type, which show high facility for single electron donation [2, 3]. The one- electron donor power of such centres depends on the evaporated metal as well as on the properties of the carrier. The catalytic systems of alkali metal- oxide type, rich in F^\" sites, show high activity and very high selectivity in the cleavage and formation of C H bonds under mild conditions [3].

On the other hand, in absence of hydrogen, the superbasic systems catalyse the rapid polymerization of conjugated dienes (e.g. isoprene or cycloocta- dienes) at low temperatures [5, 6]. Their activity in such reactions may be compared with that of alim-type catalysts. The present paper demonstrates the results of our investigations on the application of catalysts possessing very strong one-electron donor properties in the reaction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen. Concomitant with in- vestigations of the activity of superbasic catalytic systems, we also studied bifunctional catalysts in which the interaction of the surface color centres and additionally deposited metal phase could be expected. Such catalysts have been obtained by evaporation of an alkali metal (sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium) onto the alumina surface on which the reduced nickel or cobalt phase was already present. Experimental The alkali metals were evaporated at temperatures of 523 - 700 K according to the method described elsewhere [1, 2]. The ferrous metal supported catalysts were obtained by impregnation of oxide carriers with an aqueous solution of ?(N03)2-SHp or Co(N03)2-6H20. The deposited nitrates were then decomposed at 773 K in a stream of air during 3 h and reduced in stream of hydrogen for 4 h at 673 K. In this way, catalysts were prepared containing 1 and 5 wt.% of nickel or cobalt on alumina. The initial support was obtained by hydrolysis of Al(i-OC3H7)3 [7, 8]. A1203 was calcined in a stream of dry deoxygenated nitrogen over 16 h before alkali metal evaporation or ferrous metal salt impregnation. All operations with catalysts were carried out in an oxygen- and water-free atmosphere. The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over all investigated catalysts was carried out in a batch-type reactor at 573 K under normal pressure. Each reaction was performed with 80 cm3 of an equimolar gas mixture in the presence of 300 mg of the catalyst. For the selected series of the most active catalysts, i.e. based on alumina doped with potassium vapours, CO hydro- genation was also investigated in a flow system. In this case, a conventional flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed was used. The reaction was carried out at 573 K, space feed velocity (CO:H2 = 1:1) was 1.5 dm3 h~1, and the mass of catalyst was equal to 2 g. Reaction products were analyzed using a Chrom 4 gas chromatograph with a 30 m squalane capillary column for hydrocar- bons and 1 m Porapak Q column for inorganic gases. IR spectroscopic investigations of adsorbed states of carbon monoxide and of the products of its reaction with hydrogen were carried out using a Specord 75 apparatus. For the IR measurements, the catalyst samples were 229 pressed under 2.2 X 103 kN m\"2 into thin wafers (10 mg cm\"2). A wafer was placed in a vacuum cell in which the standard treatment, alkali metal evapo- ration and adsorption of gases was performed. CO was adsorbed at room temperature (10.7 kN m^2) over 20 min. After evacuation at room tempera- ture to 0.1 N m~2, the IR spectra were recorded using CaF; windows. Hydro- gen was then introduced into the cell (10.7 kN m~2) and the wafer was heated in hydrogen atmosphere at 573 K for 20 min. After cooling and evacuation, the spectra were recorded once more. The catalyst wafer trans- mission in all cases was in the range of 30%. ESR measurements were carried out at room temperature using a Jeol JMX spectrometer. Adsorption of CO (6.7 kN m~2) was performed at room temperature, and adsorption of the CO and H; mixture (1:1, 6.7 kN m~2) at 573 K, i.e. reaction temperature. Investigations of the phase structure of the studied catalysts were carried out using a DRON-2 X-ray diffractometer. Unfortunately, due to low nickel and cobalt contents, the only observed diffraction pattern was that derived from poly crystalline 7-A1203. Results and discussion Catalytic activity Both superbase as well as superbase-ferrous metal catalysts exhibited activity in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (Table 1). However, the activity of pure superbase systems measured as total CO conversion, was not striking. It was observed that of the catalytic systems possessing solely F^ centres (i.e. various alkali metals evaporated on alumina) the most active was the Al203-Na system, while the activity of those remaining was negligible. The results obtained in reactions carried out over catalysts of oxide-alkali metal-first triad metal type were much more interesting. For these, in com- parison with pure ferrous metal supported catalysts, much higher selectivity toward alkene formation was observed at a slightly lower activity. The modifying influence depended on the alkali metal used, and showed the same trend in the case of both cobalt and nickel catalysts. Although the action of alkali metals did not change in parallel with the increase in their metallic character, drastic changes of the selectivity were obtained for catalysts containing potassium and cesium. It should be emphasized that this essential synergic effect was found for the two alkali metals for which the pure alkali metal-Al203 forms show the lowest activity (Table 1). The Flory distribution [9] plotted in Figs. 1 and 2 indicates that introduction of potassium or cesium to the ferrous metal system resulted not only in an increase in selectivity toward alkenes, but also led to an increase in the content of higher hydrocarbon fractions. CO hydrogenation was carried out in a flow system in the presence of metallic nickel and cobalt deposited on alumina in amounts of 1 and 5 wt.%; in the presence of the same catalyst modified with potassium vapours; 230 8 aa c \"S-gS c i\"S ^ 2 g4J ^is s 5 ' t S 0 u eS 0.2 a u g ^ 4->S2.CO 3 g-S-35 o >> E E-< S .a U4-> 5CO Wl .3 u ^ \"3 -^3 <r g U -34J e w e *t 3 u 12 w Jl 9 u ^ M D. 3 w a Jl (..)

The aim of these investigations was to observe possible activity changes as a function of the time on stream, also taking into consideration the possibility of the deactivation of superbasic centres by COa and small amounts of water formed during reaction. The different conditions for carrying out the process caused certain changes in the composition of the products formed.

In the case of potassium- containing catalysts, an increase in the amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons was observed simultaneously with an increase in the fraction of higher hydrocarbons in the reaction products. This effect was much more pro- nounced for systems with lower amounts of nickel and cobalt, i.e. with 1% catalyst. It should be pointed out that isobutane was found as the main synthesis product when using the A1203-K system and A^Oa-Ni-K or Al203-Co-K catalysts containing 1% of the first triad metal. The yield of isobutane reached the maximum after ca. 2 h of catalyst action, and then showed a significant decrease. The yields of other products changed insignif- icantly as a function of time on stream (Table 2). IR spectra of adsorbed species Using the transmission method, infrared spectra were obtained of car- bon monoxide and of the products of its interaction with hydrogen at 573 K adsorbed on surfaces of the following catalysts: AIzC^-Ni, A^C^-Co; A1203- Na; A^Oa-K; A^-Ni-Na; A^-Ni-K; Al203-Co-K (Fig. 3). Carbon monoxide adsorption In the IR spectrum of CO adsorbed on Al203-Ni catalyst surfaces, absorption bands appeared at the following frequencies: 2075 and 2035 cm\"1, which should be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of linearly chemisorbed CO [10 -14], 1960 and 1925 cm\"1 corresponding to the stretching vibrations of CO adsorbed in the bridged form [10 -12,14] and 1645 cm~1 (intense band) connected in our opinion with the vibration of the carbonyl form (>C=0) of adsorbed CO, analogous to the vibrations observed by Marsella and Caulton [15,16] in the case of carbonyl com- plexes of zirconium, in which oxygen from carbonyl forms a coordinative bond with metal. Absorption bands in the range of 1400 - 2200 cm\"! were not observed in the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Al203-Co and Al203-Na catalyst, in spite of repeated attempts to detect them. Three absorption bands appeared in the IR spectrum of CO adsorbed on potassium-evaporated alumina: 2060, 1705 and 1550 cm\"1. The first one was ascribed to the stretching vibration of the adsorbed C=0 species, while the lower frequency bands may be attributed only to the vibrations of the double bond between carbon and oxygen. We believe they correspond to two different paramagnetic species (Fig. 4) formed as a result of interaction of CO with surface F^ centres (see below). Taking into consideration the frequency values, that at 1705 cm\"1 could be connected with a CO radical form bonded through carbon to the surface, and the second one at 1550 cm\"1 with a two-centre bonded radical (through carbon and oxygen atoms). The IR spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed on bifunctional catalysts reflect the new properties of these catalysts. The following bands appeared in the spectra: 2045, 1950, 1905, 1710, 1600 and 1540 cm-1 for the A^-Ni-K system; 2055, 1965,1915 and 1705 cm-1 for the Al203-Ni-Na 235 AI^-K (A) AlzOa-Ni (B) AI^Oa-Ni-Na (C) AlzOa-Ni-K (D) Al2C>3-Co-K (E) cm 2000 WO WO WO -(600 ASOO Fig. 3.

Two general features are observed in these spectra: (1) the appearance of bands in the range of 1705 cm\"1 and below 1650 cm\"1; they seem to derive from CO adsorption on paramagnetic centres generated by alkali metal atoms (F^ centres); (2) the significant increase in the intensities of the bands in the 2000 - 1900 cm~1 (1850 cm~1 for cobalt catalyst) region, which indicates that the bridged forms of adsorbed CO species begin to dominate on the metal phase. This second observation could be a measure of the direct influence of alkali metal on ferrous metal properties. Reaction with hydrogen Upon the action of hydrogen at 573 K on the CO adsorbed forms, new surface species were generated. The IR spectra of these hydrogen-treated preparations differ completely from those of pure CO states. For all alkali metal-doped catalysts, the strong absorption band around 1590 cm~1 domi- nates. This band may correspond to C=0 vibrations in surface formyi species which are formed as a result of the reaction of CO with H2 and which inter- act with the catalyst surface in the same mode as in transition metal formyi complexes already reported in the literature [17 -19]. For the Al203-Ni-K and Al203-Co-K catalysts, new bands were also observed at frequencies of 1680 and 1735 cm~1 respectively. In this region (1750 cm\"!) a weak band appeared in the spectrum of the A1203-K catalyst. In our opinion this band derives from surface formyi species in which the carbonyl oxygen does not interact with the catalyst surface. The remaining bands at higher frequencies might be ascribed to the vibrations of residual unreacted CO surface species. ESR measurements In a study of adsorption and reaction mechanisms, the ESR spectra of carbon monoxide, and also of its equimolar mixture with hydrogen, adsorbed on A1203-K and Al203-Ni-K surfaces were obtained. The adsorption of CO was performed at room temperature, whereas the mixture of gases was adsorbed at 573 K, i.e. at reaction temperature. In all cases, after the adsorp- 237 Fig. 5. The ESR spectra obtained after adsorption of: (1) CO at room temperature, (2) an equimolar mixture of CO and Ha at 573 K on the surfaces of: (a) A1203-K catalyst, (b) Al203-Ni-K catalytic system. tion of gases the narrow signal from F^\" centres (g = 2.003) was no longer observed in the ESR spectra. CO adsorption For both catalysts under study, CO adsorption led to the formation of surface paramagnetic states. In the case of the A1203-K system, a complex ESR spectrum was recorded (Fig. 5). Most probably this spectrum is the superposition of two signals: the broad symmetric one of rvalue 1.993 and a second relatively narrow one with g = 2.0040. This result was in good agreement with IR investigations which revealed the presence of two surface carbonyl species bonded to the surface (bands in the low frequency region). The symmetric signal could be ascribed to the carbon-bonded radical, which did not lose rotational ability, and the second signal to the two-point bonded radical species. The ESR signal derived from CO adsorbed on the A1203- Ni-K system (Fig. 5) was symmetrical (g = 2.0043, AHmax = 8.8 Gs). This result could be surprising at first glace, and in contrast with the variety of carbon monoxide species on the surface of that catalyst as observed by IR spectroscopy. Nevertheless, one should note the presence of the reduced ferrous metal phase and the possibility of exchange interactions between it and paramagnetic surface states causing the disappearance of signal anisot- ropy. The intensities of both above ESR signals corresponded to a concentra- tion of paramagnetic species in the range of 1018 spin g~1, at which the amount of these species was ca. two times higher for the Al203-Ni-K system. Simultaneous CO and hydrogen adsorption Similarly, the adsorption of a gas mixture on the surface of the investi- gated catalysts, carried out at 573 K, also resulted in formation of a para- magnetic surface species. For the pure AlaOa-K catalyst, the observed 238 ESR signal (Fig. 5) was symmetrical (^=2.0052, A/i/max = 7.4 Gs). The character of the recorded spectrum suggests a unification of adsorbed CO species after reaction with hydrogen. In our opinion the IR results (essen- tially one strong absorption band at 1595'cm~1) confirm such a supposition. The ESR signal recorded after adsorption of CO and Ha on potassium-doped nickel catalyst was of anisotropic character gi = 2.0035, g^ = 2.0060, g^ = 2.0079. We see the source of the observed anisotropy in the differentiation of surface states of CO bonded with Hz (see IR spectra) which is not masked by exchange interactions of radicals with metallic nickel modified by hydro- gen adsorption. It should be emphasized that by considering the character as well as the total (~30 Gs) and A??max widths of all the above ESR signals, one could exclude the possibility of their derivation from radical carbonaceous deposits formed from carbon monoxide disproportionation (ESR signals of coke exhibit AHmax co- 1 Gs). Conclusions Alumina doped with alkali metal vapours and especially bifunctional catalytic systems containing simultaneously alkali and ferrous metals appear to be active in the addition of hydrogen to carbon monoxide molecules. It might be stated that activity in hydrogenation and also in polymerization exhibited by very strong one-electron donor centres, which are the surface defects F^\", is not limited to hydrocarbon transformations. This observation strengthens the analogy between F^ sites containing oxides with electron donor-acceptor complexes formed by polyaromatic hydrocarbons and alkali metals, the properties and activity of which were widely described by Tamaru [20]. Similarly, as in the case of diene hydrogenation, one should emphasize the mildness of the superbase action, reflected in the significant unsaturated hydrocarbon content in the reaction products. The properties and activity exhibited by the bifunctional catalysts studied in this work possess more complex grounds than systems containing solely color centres. Firstly the individual participation of F^ centres present on the surface in catalysed transformations should be taken into considera- tion. This idea is supported by the following: (1) the appearance of the same absorption bands in IR spectra obtained for both bifunctional systems and catalysts possessing exclusively F^\" sites after adsorption of CO or after adsorbed CO interaction with H;; (2) the existence of paramagnetic radical species revealed by ESR spec- troscopy in both cases. Secondly, and equally essential, the influence of alkali metal on the structure of the transition metal phase should be considered. Unfortunately, this struc- ture was not closely defined due to the absence of any X-ray diffraction pattern. The existence of the modifying effect of alkali metal was confirmed by essential changes in the region 1900 - 2000 cm\"1 of the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on bimetallic catalysts in relation to spectra of CO adsorbed on the 239 pure ferrous metal system. Irrespective of which of the two listed factors dominated, the alkali metal-modified systems exhibit greater selectivity toward alkenes and produce longer carbon chains than do pure ferrous phases. Of importance is the observation that the activity of the catalysts studied does not disappear after contact with C02 and H^O formed in reac- tion, which should lead to an immediate deactivation of the catalyst. The presence of isobutane (alkane!) as the main product in the flow reaction, and the changes in its amount as a function of the process time, noted for both superbasic and low ferrous metal content bifunctional catalysts, should be given special consideration. It may be suspected that the observed phenom- enon is connected with the formation of an intermediate surface species which disappears with time. In such surface states, one of the short chain alkenes probably takes part. Nevertheless, an explanation of this observation requires further investigations. References 1 J. Kijenski and S.

Carbon monoxide hydrogenation has been investigated over superbasic and superbase-ferrous metal catalysts. The superbasic systems were obtained by evaporation of alkali metals onto the A12O3 surface and the ‘bifunctional’ catalysts by the action of alkali metal vapours on previously reduced transition metals on alumina. A shift of activity was observed in the direction of alkenes and longer carbon chains when compared with the pure first triad metal-supported catalysts. The surface species formed upon adsorption of CO and subsequent reaction with hydrogen were investigated using IR and ESR spectroscopies. In the IR spectra of alkali metal-doped nickel and cobalt catalysts, new bands derived from the adsorption of CO on the alkali metal generated states were observed, as well as basic changes in the adsorption region characteristic for transition metals. ESR spectroscopy revealed the presence of paramagnetic surface species after CO adsorption and subsequent reaction with H2 on the superbasic and bimetallic catalyst surfaces. References 1 J.
