Introduction Modern generations of metallocene-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts consist of essentially one type of catalytically active center which produces 1-olefin-homo-and copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and uniform comonomer distributions [ 1-3 ] . The development of such single-site catalysts greatly facilitates the elucidation of elementary reactions in transitionmetal catalysed polyinsertion and stimulates the production of novel polyolefin materials [4-6]. Objective of our research is to understand polymerization kinetics of the metallocene-catalyzed homo-and copolymerization of 1-olefins. Here we report a new reactor system, combining feed control and reaction calorimetry, to simultaneously monitor total polymerization rate and individual * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The homogeneous Cp2ZrC12 catalyst activated with methylalumoxane (MAO) [7,8] has been used to prepare propene and 1-octene homoand copolymers. 2. Apparatus The calorimeter RM-2S with a 200 ml/ 100 atm stainless-steel reactor and the VRC-IN interface were supplied by ChemiSens AB (S-223 78 Lund, Sweden). This reactor system is a combined heat flow and heat balance calorimeter. The calorimeter was equipped with a personal computer and software for graphic display and data storage. As is apparent in Fig. 1, a mass flow meter (F-11I C, Bronkhorst, NL-7261 AK Ruurlo, Netherlands) and a pressure gage were connected to the VRC- 12 M. Schneider, R.

A HPLC injection circuit and a high pressure pump were used for the injection of the catalyst solution. With this reactor system it was possible to measure reactor temperature, reactor pressure, heat flow, heat balance, and mass flow and control pressure and temperature independently. 3. Polymerization procedure Cp2ZrC12 and I-octene were obtained from Aldrich Co., MAO (10 wt%, Mn=1000 g/mol) from Witco GmbH (former Schering AG), toluene from Roth GmbH, and propene ( polymerization grade) from the BASF AG. Toluene solvent was rectified over LiAlH4, refluxed and distilled over Na/K alloy prior to use. 1-Octene was distilled over CaHz. CpzZrClz, propene, and MAO were used without further purification. All substances were handled under dry and oxygenfree argon atmosphere. The stainless-steel reactor was rinsed with 150 ml of a 0.03 mol/1 Al(CH(CH3)z)s solution in toluene prior to use. Toluene, 1-octene (0-0.82 mol/1), and MAO (50 mmol/1) were pumped into the stainless-steel reactor. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 100 ml and the polym- erization temperature was 40. After the calibration of the calorimeter propene (0-0.82 mol/1, equal to 0-2 atm at 40) was added and heat flow ( Qsat) and mass flow (Msat) of the saturation of propene in toluene were measured for the calculation of the heat of solution ( QP,S) of propene in toluene (1) . tt rt QP,SOl = MP * ~, Qsat/ J: Msat t=to t=to where MP = molecular weight of propene, to = start of saturation, tl = end of saturation. The total concentration of the monomers ( propene and 1-octene) was 0.82 mol/1 in all runs. After saturating toluene with propene, 2 ml of CpzZrClz solution in toluene (1.46 mg CP2ZrCl2 equivalent to 50 .tmol/1 and AI/Zr= 1000) was added to start the polymerization. The pressure of propene was kept constant during the polymerization. After 1 h the calorimeter was calibrated again (postcalibration), before quenching the polymerization with 10 ml methanol. 4.

Qtot ' QP,s01 + QP,pol + QO,pol Thus the heat flow of the copolymerization reaction (QpO,po,) is measured as reduced total heat flow by subtracting the heat flow of the solution heat of propene in toluene (Qp,so,) from the total heat flow ( Qtot) ( 3 ) . QPO,pol - QP,pol + QO,pol Qtot QP,s01 ( 3 ) As depicted in Fig. 3, the mass flow of propene (Mp) which is required to maintain constant reactor pressure, was measured using the mass flow meter. The heat flow of solution heat of propene ( Qp,SO,) in toluene can be calculated using Eq. (4) . (2) QP,s01 - QP.SOI * 4I Mp (4) The calculated heat flow of the copolymerization ( Qpo,po, ) is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of time. The heat flow of the propene polymerization (Qp,po,) can be calculated using the mass flow of propene into the reactor (Mp) and the heat of propene homopolymerization (Qp,p.1) (5). The heat of propene homopolymerization ( Qp,po, ) was determined from a propene homopolymerization experiment. QP,PoI QP,PoI * MP / MP (5) As the solubility of propene in toluene depends strongly on temperature and pressure, even small changes of the reaction conditions, especially at the start of polymerization, have to be taken into account. The calculated heat flow of propene polymerization ( Qp,po, ) is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, these changes of the polymerization conditions at the beginning of the polymerization were not completely compensated. The heat flow of the 1-octene polymerization ( Qo,pol ) can be calculated by subtracting the heat flow of the propene polymerization (Qp,po,) from the heat flow of the copolymerization reaction ( Qpo,po, ) ( see ( 6 ) and Fig. 4 ) .

(11) , (12) , and (13) leads to Eq. (14) . Rop = RPO => For the calculation of the monomer reactivity ratios the equations of the Mayo /Lewis model [ 9] were used. As a consequence of the first-order ro=koo/kop Markoffian statistics, the total polymerization rate (Rtot) depends on the number of active sites rp ([M, [MP]), the monomer concentrations ([ Mo ] , [ Mp ] ) ,and the rate constants (koo, kop, kPO, kPP) (7) . [MO*] / [MP l =kpoLMol /koPLMPI RtotkPP [Mo] - kookPP L MO l 2 ) r0 + ( Rtotkoo L MPl - kPPkoo L MP l Z ) rP (12) (13) = 2kookPP f Mo l f MP] (14 ) Rtot = Roo + Rop + RPO + RPP =kooLM [Mol +koPLM LMPI +kMP ] [Mol +kPPLMl [Mol P At the beginning of the polymerization reaction the number of active sites is assumed to be the same in the performed experiments, since the same amount of the catalyst is used (8). [ M] + [ MP ] = const. The heat flow of the copolymerization ( QOp,pol ) depends on the polymerization rates and the polymerization heat of the monomers 1-octene and propene ( Qo,pol, Qp Pol ) ( 9 ) . QOP.PoI ( ROO + RPO ) * QO,PoI + ( ROP + RPP) * QP,PoI (9) Qo,pol and Qp, are determined from the corresponding homopolymerizations and found to be equivalent within limits of errors. Thus Eq. (9) leads to the simple correlation where the heat flow of the copolymerization (QOp,po,) is proportional to the total polymerization rate ( Rtot ) (10 ) . QP,pol - QO,pol - QOP,PoI ( ROO + RPO + ROP + RPP) * QP,PoI - Rtot * QP,pol (10) Because of the deactivation of the catalyst with time, the maximum heat flow of the total polymerization reaction (Amax, see Fig. 4) is used for calculating the total polymerization rate (Rtot). The homopolymerization rate constants ( koo, kpp) are calculated from the homopolymerizations Abbreviation of Eq. (14 ) : a * ro + b * rp = c Eq. (14) contains two undefined constants: ro and rp. These constants can be evaluated using the data of two copolymerizations 1 and 2 ( (15 ) and ro= (bz*CWbl*Cz)l(al*bz-az*bl) (15) rp;-= (a,*c2-cl*az)l(al*b2-a2*bl) (16) 6. Results The CpzZrClz/MAO system was selected as model catalyst because both catalyst and homo-or copolymers, respectively, remain in solution during the polymerization. The use of Eqs. (15 ) and (16) in connection with the data of the experiments ( see Table 1) leads to ro = 0.69 and rp=4.8. The monomer reactivity ratios determined by' 3C-NMR are ro = 0.61 and rp = 5.0. The accordance of the calculated ro and rp determined by the maximum heat flow ( Q,r,ax ) with the ro and rp determined by NMR is shown in Fig. 5. The upper curve represents the maximum heat flow as Table 1 Experimental maximum heat flows 1-Octene [mol%] Propene [mol%] Max. heat flow (Qmax) [J/s] loo 75 so 25 0 0 25 so 75 100 0.57 +_ 0.05 0.90 0.05 1.78+0.05 3.03 .05 5.18 f 0.05 M.

The lower curve is calculated with the ro and rp determined by the Eqs. (15) and (16) . As indicated in Table 2, the four relative rate constants of the copolymerization reaction can be calculated using the homopolymerization rate constants koo and kpp and the monomer reactivity ratios ro and rp. The relative values of the rate constants can be explained on the basis of steric interactions when the monomer complexes at the vacant coordination site and inserts into the zirconium alkyl bond. The less sterically hindered propene inserts faster when compared to 1-octene insertion (kpp > koo). Interestingly, the last monomeric unit appears to influence the insertion of the 1-olefin monomers. In comparison to polymers where a propene unit is attached to the active center, the presence of a 15 1-octene unit adjacent to the active center accounts for lower rate constants (kpp > kop and k> koo). 7. Conclusions The reaction calorimeter equipped with a mass flow meter monitors simultaneously the total and individual kinetics of the copolymerization of liquid and gaseous monomers. The equations of the kinetics of free radical copolymerization (firstorder Markoffian statistics) are valid within limits of errors for the 1-olefin copolymerization with the single site catalyst Cp2ZrC12 activated with MAO. When two homo-and two (or more) copolymerization experiments are performed, it is possible to determine the monomer reactivity ratios as well as the four propagation rate constants. This provides the basis for a better understanding of the chain propagation process and the parameters governing the incorporation of the comonomers of the active sites. This insight into elementary reactions offers interesting potential in controlling 1-olefin copolymerizations with single site metallocene catalysts.
