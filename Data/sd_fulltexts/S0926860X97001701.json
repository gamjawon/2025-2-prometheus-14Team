Japan Received 3 April 1997; received in revised form 29 April 1997: accepted 30 April 1997 Abstract CO hydrogenation and the low temperature non-oxidative methane coupling to form higher hydrocarbons over Ru/SiO2 and Ru/AI203 prepared by incipient wetness method and Ru/AI203 prepared by sol/gel method (denoted by catalysts I, II and lII, respectively) have been compared. Catalysts II and III possess selectivity for the formation of C5+ hydrocarbons higher than sample I and the energy of activation is 85.7 kJ/mol on the catalyst III, which is about 29-33 kJ/mol less than those measured for catalysts I and II. The striking feature of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution (ASF) points to the existence of an umbilical cord mechanism and at lower temperature the reinsertion of ~-olefins in concurrence with hydrogenolysis results in a sigmoid distribution. With increase in temperature insertion becomes more and more prevalent process and the sigmoid curve is transformed into two straight lines with different slopes. Similar behavior is valid for the \"two-step reaction\" in the methane coupling carried out over different ruthenium catalysts, of which sample III has the highest selectivity for C2 hydrocarbons.

Introduction Earlier studies over Ru/A1203 and Ru/SiO2 cata- lysts have indicated a drastic effect of the support in CO hydrogenation [1]. However, in those ex- periments a variation in metal particle size was associated with the change in metal loading and thus, the effects due to the particle size and the metal/support interaction, could not be separated. *Corresponding author. Fax: +36 1 3959001; e-mail: guc zi@ alpha0.iki.kfki.hu Consequently, the change could be ascribed to the interface of metal/metal oxide/alumina (silica) which also affects hydrogen activation. A similar support effect was experienced in low temperature methane coupling [2]. Ru/SiO2 prepared by the sol/gel method has revealed high selectivity in the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene due to the small particle size [3]. Other studies also illustrated the superior behavior of the metal catalysts prepared by this method [4]. In the present study ruthenium catalysts impregnated by incipient wetness method on silica or alumina supports prepared by sol/gel method (I and II) 0926-860X/97/$17.00 :~' 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental 2 wt% Ru/A1203 (III) was prepared by sol/gel method mixing 1.5 g of RuC13.nH20 in 10 cm3 etha- nol with 123.5 g of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol [5]. Then 106.5 g AI(i-OC3HT)3 was added to this solution and stirred for 3 h at 80-90. 42 g water was then added to the solution and the gelation was carried out at the same temperature for 3 h. The gel obtained was dried at 170 under vacuum. 5 wt% Ru/SiO2 and 2 wt% Ru/A1203 catalysts (I and II) were prepared by incipient wetness technique using silica or alumina support prepared by sol/gel method from the corre- sponding alkoxides. All supports were calcined at 450 for 5 h. All catalysts were dried and reduced in hydrogen at 400 for 4 h. The X-ray diffraction of the alumina supported samples indicates small parti- cles which are X-ray amorphous [6]. CO hydrogenation was carried out in a plug-flow system with a mixture of H2/CO=2, the flow rate was 15 cm3/min and the amount of catalyst 100 mg. The hydrocarbon products were analyzed by gas chroma- tograph type Packard 901 using a 2 m long 1/8 in. i.d. column filled with Porapaq Q. The conversion was calculated for the hydrocarbons produced. The num- ber of metal sites exposed was determined by CO chemisorption assuming a CO/Ru=I stoichiometry using a flow adsorption system. The two-step reaction for methane coupling was studied in a flow system (detailed elsewhere [7]) using 100 mg catalyst and a temperature of 250 both for methane chemisorption and for hydrogenation. The collected samples were analyzed by gas chroma- tograph type Packard 437 using a column 2 m long 1/8 in. i.d. filled with phenylisocyanate on Porasil C. 3. Results and discussion Some of the metal particles in the sol/gel prepared sample are occluded in the matrix. As in the prepara- tion 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol was applied during gelation as solvent, the metal ions are multiply anchored by diols. Accordingly, just before activation (heat treatment) metal ions should be surrounded with diol molecules. During activation as diols are elimi- nated, metal ions are located in the pores: at bottom, middle of the pore or at the pore mouth. This was suggested by XPS studies [3]. Thus, we might not avoid some diffusion problems, particularly when the reaction is fast. The CO hydrogenation was carried out in a tem- perature range between 220 and 290. In Tables 1 and 2 the kinetic results and selectivity patterns, respectively, are presented for samples I, II and III. The main feature is the high catalytic activity of the alumina supported catalysts vs. the silica-supported one and the different selectivities. The turnover fre- quencies (TOF) measured at 250 for catalysts I, II and III (2.2, 1.9 and 2.2 s-~, respectively) are in the range reported earlier [8-12]. On silica-supported ruthenium the value is somewhat higher [13,14], which is not entirely due to the dispersion, as was suggested by Boudart [15]. The major difference is in the energy of activation which is 29-33 kJ/mole smaller for III than for catalysts I and II. The Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution (ASF) measured on catalysts II and III shows an interesting feature as illustrated by sample II and III in Fig. 1 (top and bottom panel). For the smaller carbon-number products the plot is linear, but upward deviation is seen for products of larger carbon-number. A similar phe- nomenon was also observed by Pannell on Ru/AI203 and Co/A1203 samples [9] and by Kuipers on Co/SiO2 catalysts [16]. According to Kuipers's work the sig- moid distribution was interpreted by an umbilical cord Table 1 Rate (in /amol g~Is 1), energy of activation (kJ/mol) of CO hydrogention, CO adsorption (in ~mol/gcat), Sc~ and Scz~ selectivities, and dispersion, D (%), over various samples Catalysts Rate (107 /amol gcat-1 S 1) COads (lamol/gcat) Ea (kJ/mol) D (%) Sc, (%) So:.

This is supported by the selectivity values being independent of the flow rate. However, this effect is counterbalanced by hydroge- nolysis of the higher hydrocarbons (unsaturated and saturated) already sitting on the metal surface and this is supported by the excellence of ruthenium in hydro- carbon hydrogenolysis [17,18]. The new feature on the sol/gel prepared ruthenium catalysts is that at higher temperature the sigmoid character of the ASF is attenuated and substituted by two straight lines with different slopes. On catalyst III this attenuation occurs at significantly lower tempera- ture. This means that the reinsertion of c~-olefins successfully competes with hydrogenolysis, thus, the chain growth is gradually diminished. With increasing temperature, as illustrated by the selectiv- ities, samples II and III behave similarly regardless of whether only the A1203 or Ru/A1203 were prepared by sol/gel method. The only difference between the ASFs' curves is their variation with temperature being larger on sample II! than on II (see Fig. 1). This is likely due to the slightly lower ruthenium dispersion on the latter sample which makes the physisorbed layer of the c~-olefins with higher carbon numbers less temperature sensitive for the desorption, thus chain growth by insertion has higher probability. The results of CH4 coupling are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The smallest amount of methane chemisorbed is observed on Ru/SiO2, the yield, however, being the largest, which is due to the weak interaction of the surface CHx species with large metal particles. The main products are ethene and ethane with small amount of propane. On sample II also small amount of methane is formed and the selectivity pattern does not differ from silica-supported ruthenium to a large extent. The slight difference is indicated by the lower methane selectivity along with higher C2+ selectivity. 1.5 0.5 -0.5 -1 -1.5 --I- T=240 C i T=250 C -~- T=261 C I I I I I I I I I I I k l 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 IS C-number 2 1.5 1 0.5 -0,5 -1,5 ~- T=227 C -g- T=240 C -A- T=252 C \"% \\ \\ , \\'X 1 2 3 4 S 6 7 8 9 10 II 12 13 14 15 C-number Fig. 1.

It is believed that due to the local overheating (due to the high reactivity of small ruthenium particles with oxygen) in the vicinity of small ruthenium particles, the pores are closed and a part of ruthenium particles are occluded. In summary, the catalyst prepared with sol/gel technique shows slightly better performance both in CO hydrogenation and methane activation to form higher hydrocarbons at a moderate temperature than the traditionally prepared Ru catalyst. Care should be taken for the stability of the catalysts which is far better in the CO hydrogenation than in the methane activation.
