K. STILLE* and GIOVANNI PARRINELLO Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523 (U.S.A.) Summary Polymers (2 and 3) containing an optically active chelating phosphine ligand were obtained by copolymerizing N-acryloyl-(2S, 4S)-4-(diphenyl- phosphino)-2-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]pyrrolidine (1) either with hy- droxyethyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate or with styrene/divinyl- benzene, respectively. Platinum chloride was exchanged onto the polymer supports, and hydroformylation reactions of styrene were carried out in the presence of stannous chloride with a 1:1 mixture of Ha/CO. Although branched to normal ratios were low (~0.5), high optical yields (70%) of hydratropaldehyde were obtained. These are the highest optical yields that have been achieved with a polymer-supported chiral catalyst. Introduction Polymer support of homogeneous catalysts is of particular interest in the area of asymmetric catalysis, since it is desirable to be able to recover and re-use both the transition metal and the optically active ligand [1, 2]. Very few chiral polymer-bound ligands have been synthesized, however [3 -17]. Two of the most challenging problems in the design of a polymer- supported homogeneous catalyst lie in the synthesis of a polymer support compatible with the reaction solvent and the introduction of chiral ligands of high optical purity at controlled locations on the polymer [1, 2]. This can be best accomplished through the synthesis of a chiral phosphine-containing monomer, which subsequently can be incorporated into the polymer, usually through vinyl polymerization. Most of the transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric organic syntheses by use of polymer-attached optically active phosphine ligands have been asym- metric hydrogenations. Only a few asymmetric hydroformylations have been carried out by polymer-attached chiral catalysts. Generally low optical * Author is whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 204 yields have been reported [15]. We were able to effect an asymmetric hydroformylation reaction with a DIOP-rhodium catalyst bound to poly- styrene beads, but the optical yields obtained in the hydroformylation of styrene generally were lower (~11% e.e.) than those optical yields obtained from the analogous homogeneous catalysts (~30% e.e.). The low optical yields were attributed primarily to the racemization of the product hy- dratropaldehyde under the reaction conditions. Z-2-butene could be hydro- formylated, however, to yield 2-methylbutanal in 28% e.e., a value com- parable with that obtained in the homogeneous hydroformylation utilizing the DIOP-rhodium catalyst. None of these optical yields is high enough for these methods to be useful asymmetric syntheses [18 - 20]. More recently, however, high optical yields (as high as 95% e.e. in the hydroformylation of styrene [3]) have been obtained utilizing catalyst prepared from homogeneous dibenzophosphole DIOP PtCli-SnCli. When DIOP was used instead of the dibenzophosphole analog, only 30 - 35% e.e. was realized. Nevertheless, a polystyrene-supported DIOP-PtClz-SnCIa catalyst gave comparable optical yields, 29% e.e. Results and discussion In order to obtain a polymer-bound optically active chelating phosphine, we chose to introduce the potential catalyst site into the polymer by co- polymerizing a vinyl monomer containing the phosphine ligands with the appropriate comonomers. We report the synthesis of such polymers contain- ing the chiral phosphine ligands, the exchange of PtCla-SnCI; onto the polymer, and the asymmetric hydroformylation of styrene with these catalysts. Polymer-bound catalysts We have described the synthesis of the vinyl monomers (2R, 4-R)- and (2S, 4iS)-JV-acryloyl-4-(diphenylphosphino)-2-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]- pyrrolidines previously [5]. The (2S,4S) enantiomer (1) used in these studies, was copolymerized with hydroxyethyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate by free radical initiation (Scheme 1). The resulting cross- linked, flocculent polymer (2) containing 5 mol% phosphine monomer swelled both in non-polar solvents such as benzene, and polar solvents such as ethanol. A suspension polymerization of 1 with styrene and divinyl- benzene gave 60 ^m polymer beads of 3 which contained 10 mol% of the phosphine monomer and crosslinking agent. Each polymer containing the chiral phosphine ligand was allowed to react with bis(benzonitrile)dichloroplatinum(II) in methylene chloride in order to exchange platinum onto the polymer, and stannous chloride di- hydrate was then added. Generally, the exchange of platinum was carried out just prior to the catalytic hydroformylation reactions. 205 0^^^\\. ^- '^ JO-OS L L.-lo.ss L \\ 1 Jo.i \"^ ^ ^ ^-^0 AIBN ^. ^ -h^^ ^ AIBN Scheme 1 Hydroformy lotion reactions Because the effectiveness of the BPPM in asymmetric hydroformylations with the PtCla-SnClz catalyst was unknown, homogeneous hydroformyla- tions were carried out using A^-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-(2S, 4S')-4-(diphenyl- phosphino)-2-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]pyrrolidine (4). The hydrofor- mylation of styrene utilizing this catalyst was carried out under different conditions to yield a mixture of branched and normal aldehydes (Table 1). Generally, selectivity to branched aldehyde was not high (b/n 0.40 - 0.55), but virtually no ethylbenzene was formed.

Relatively high optical yields could be obtained, particularly when the reaction times were short and the temperature was low. At low temperatures and short reaction times, the conversion to aldehyde was low, however. The lower optical yields at longer reaction times were a result of the slow racemization of the product under the reaction conditions. When a mixture of 2-phenylpropanal and 4-phenylpropanal was stirred in the presence of the catalyst and benzene solvent under the reaction conditions (2500 psi of a 1:1 H2:CO mixture at 60 C) for 60 h, the optical purity of the 2-phenyl- propanal was reduced from 48% to 33.5%. Copolymer 2 containing exchanged platinum also catalyzed the hydro- formylation of styrene (Table 2). The reactions were carried out over a 24-h period.

Thus, 70% optical yields were obtained. Re-use of the catalyst resulted in somewhat lower rates, but the optical yields were maintained (Table 2). Hydroformylation reactions of styrene using polymeric ligand 3 were carried out under the standard conditions (Table 3). The relatively high optical yields remained constant on recycling the catalyst. Optical yields obtained with the BPPM-containing catalysts are some of the highest obtained. Only the homogeneous (-)DBP-DIOP-PtCl2 catalyst has given higher optical yields [3]. Nevertheless, the optical yields achieved by the polymer-bound BPPM catalyst made from 2 and 3 are the highest yet realized from a polymer-supported catalyst. Experimental section All reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Manipulations involving phosphines in solution were carried out in a glove bag or by Schlenk techniques. Inert gases were dried and deoxygenated by successive passage through a column packed with manganous carbonate and 4A-type molecular sieves; the column was periodically regenerated with hydrogen at 360 C. 'H NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian EM 360 or on a Nicolet NT-360 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. \"P NMR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet NT-150 instrument with 80% H3?04 as the external reference. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Beckman Model 4240 as a neat sample or in potassium bromide pellets. Optical rotations were measured in benzene on a Rudolph Research, Autopol III, automatic polarimeter. Elemental analyses were obtained from Micro- 208 Tech Laboratories, Skokie, IL. Synthesis gas (1:1, H2:CO) was purchased as a custom mixture from SGP Inc. and was used as received. Styrene was washed with sodium hydroxide solution and water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure just prior to use.

Copolymerization of 1 with hydroxyethylmethacrylate and ethylene di- methacrylate to give 2 To a resin kettle with an efficient overheat stirrer was added, under nitrogen, 25 ml of degassed benzene, which was then heated to 65 C. A solution of 0.872 g (6.7 mmol) of freshly distilled hydroxy methacrylate, 0.156 g (0.79 mmol) of ethylene dimethacrylate, 0.20 g (0.39 mmol) of 1 and 20 mg of AIBN in 10 ml of benzene was degassed by two freeze-pump- thaw cycles and added to the kettle. The mixture was stirred at 65 C for 12 h and then filtered under argon. The filter cake was dried under reduced pressure to yield 1.1 g (90%) of white powder. Anal. for P: 2.13. This corresponds to the incorporation of 5.36 mol% of the phosphine monomer in 2. Copolymerization of 1 with styrene and divinylbenzene to give 3 A solution of 500 mg of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in 30 ml of water was degassed by two freeze-pump-thaw cycles, transferred to a Morton creased flask containing a variable speed stirrer, and heated to 65 C under argon. A mixture of 223 mg (0.439 mmol) 1, 83.9 mg (0.64 mmol) divinylbenzene, 728.9 mg (7.00 mmol) styrene and 20 mg of AIBN was degassed and added to the flask. The mixture was stirred for 23 h, cooled, and filtered. The beads were washed with methanol and dried to give 250 mg (25%) of 60 Jum beads. Anal. for P: 4.45. This corresponds to the incorporation of 10 mol% of phosphine monomer in 3. Preparation of4-PtCl^ A solution of 95.8 mg (0.203 mmol) of bis(benzonitrile)dichloro- platinum(II) [23, 24] in 10 ml of benzene was added to a refluxing solution of 200 mg (0.361 mmol) of 4 in 8 ml of benzene under argon. After 2 h, half the volume of solvent was evaporated, and the product was precipitated with diethyl ether. 209 Exchange of platinum onto 2 A solution of 19.4 mg of bis(benzonitrile)dichloroplatinum(II) in 15 ml of methylene chloride was added to 200 mg of 2, and the mixture was stirred under argon for 18 h. (The ratio of P:Pt = 3.4.) The mixture was filtered in a Schlenk tube, dried under reduced pressure and stirred under argon. Exchange of platinum onto 3 A solution of 39.9 mg of bis(benzonitrile)dichloroplatinum(II) in methylene chloride was added to 200 mg of 3. The exchange was carried out and the catalyst isolated as described for 2. Homogeneous hydroformy lotion of styrene with ^-PtCl^ (Table 1) Into a 50 ml Parr Monel bomb was charged 26.2 mg (3.2 X 10~2 mmol) of 4-PtCl2 and 18.1 mg (8 X 10~2 mmol) of stannous chloride dihydrate. The bomb was brought into an argon-filled glove bag, and charged with 3.0 ml (25.9 mmol) of styrene and 6 ml of benzene. The bomb was sealed, pres- surized, and vented three times with the synthesis gas mixture (1:1 Ha: CO) and then pressurized (usually to 2500 psi) and heated with stirring to the desired temperature in an oil bath. At the end of the reaction, the bomb was quenched in a dry ice bath, the pressure was vented, and the solvent was removed by distillation. The light yellow product mixture was vacuum- transferred from the catalyst and analyzed by GLC (10% OV-101 Chromasorb W-HP, 80/100; 2m X 1/8 in, 80 to 150 C and 8 /min) using n-decane as an internal standard to determine the conversion and isomer ratio. The ratios were used to calculate the optical yield from the observed optical rotation. The optical rotation was measured on an aliquot of the reaction mixture dissolved in benzene. Hydroformylation of styrene using catalysts derived from 2 and 3 (Tables 2 and 3) The procedure for hydroformylation utilizing the heterogeneous catalysts was the same as that followed in the homogeneous hydroformyla- tion, except that at the end of the reaction, the bomb was opened in a glove bag and the catalyst was recovered by filtration.

Stille 1 Giovanni Parrinello Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523 U.S.A. 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Polymers (2 and 3) containing an optically active chelating phosphine ligand were obtained by copolymerizing N-acryloyl-(2S, 4S)-4-(diphenyl-phosphino)-2-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]pyrrolidine (1) either with hydroxyethyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate or with styrene/divinyl-benzene, respectively. Platinum chloride was exchanged onto the polymer supports, and hydroformylation reactions of styrene were carried out in the presence of stannous chloride with a 1:1 mixture of H2/CO. Although branched to normal ratios were low (~0.5), high optical yields (70%) of hydratropaldehyde were obtained. These are the highest optical yields that have been achieved with a polymer-supported chiral catalyst. References 1 J.K. Stille Pure Appl. Chem. 54 1982 99 and references therein. 2 J.K. Stille S.J.

Chem. 1974 864 22 One of the referees has pointed out that the optical rotation is not linear with concentration, such that [α]20 D is higher at high dilution. Subsequently we checked the e.e. using a chiral shift reagent, and obtained essentially the same values. See G. Consiglio P. Pino L.I. Flowers C.U. Pittman Jr. J. Chem. Soc., Chem.
