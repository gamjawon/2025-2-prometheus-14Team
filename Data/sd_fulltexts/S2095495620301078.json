Herein, we for the first time demonstrate the synthesis of exfoliated C4N nanosheets via a top–down approach and exploit their use as a new class of organic polymeric catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained C4N nanosheets are semi–conductive with a small band gap of 1.41 eV and contain abundant pyrazine–nitrogen moieties uniformly distributed throughout C4N. Density function theory calculations reveal that the intramolecular charge transfer induced by pyrazine–nitrogen in C4N enables effective charge redistribution to activate the conjugated structure and facilitate the oxygen adsorption, while the exfoliated sheet–like C4N formation renders improved electrochemical active surface area and results in high exposure of active sites. As a result, despite the bulk C4N is not active, the sheet–like C4N yield markedly improved ORR performance, even on a par with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our recent findings not only enrich the family members of two–dimensional conjugated polymer nanosheets but also open up new opportunity to explore new metal–free organic polymeric materials for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis and beyond. Graphical abstract A new class of metal–free organic catalyst based on exfoliated C4N nanosheets was produced, demonstrating excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction comparable to Pt/C due to abundant pyrazine–nitrogen moieties and highly–exposed active surface area. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Metal–free electrocatalyst Polymeric electrocatalysts C4N nanosheets Pyrazine–nitrogen Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a pivotal role in some key energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries [1–7]. However, their rapid development is still hindered by the sluggish ORR kinetics. Currently, the commercial ORR catalysts are mainly based on noble Pt–based materials, yet their scarcity, high cost, unsatisfactory stability and undesirable environment effect constrain the large–scale applications. Thus, it is urgent to search effective yet low cost alternatives to replace noble metal catalysts, yet challenging. To this end, considerable efforts have directed toward the development of environmentally friendly carbon materials for the ORR reaction [8–13]. It has been demonstrated that doping various heteroatoms into the materials can regulate the electronic structure of catalysts and thus boost the electrocatalytic activity [12–15]. Doped carbon materials are generally accepted as a potential candidate to replace Pt for reducing the cost and improve the catalyst stability. Despite great advances, the synthesis of most doped carbon catalysts involves high–temperature treatment, which often leads to high energy consumption, uncontrolled structure and limited dopant content [16–18]. Recently, two–dimensional (2D) N–containing conjugated polymers such as various carbon nitrides (C2N, C3N, and C3N4) have attracted significant interest owing to their unique dimension–related physiochemical properties and excellent chemical stability [19–21]. The abundant bond–forming reaction renders numerous opportunities in the design of 2D conjugate polymers for a series of technological applications ranging from energy storage and conversion, catalysis to electronics [22]. In particular, owing to intrinsic electronic conductivity, accurate chemical structure and tunable heteroatomic composition, 2D N–containing conjugated polymer could be a potential organic catalyst for various electrocatalytic reactions not limited to the ORR [23–25]. However, the inherent electrocatalytic potential of 2D N–containing conjugated polymers was less explored. Herein, we developed a new kind of metal–free organic polymeric ORR catalyst based on 2D C4N nanosheets (C4NNSs) produced by one–pot liquid–phase exfoliation from bulk C4N. The newly–produced C4NNSs are semi–conductive featuring a small band gap of 1.41 eV and contain numerous pyrazine nitrogen species throughout the polymer nanosheet. The electron–accepting ability of pyrazine nitrogen in C4N can trigger intramolecular charge transfer to enable effective charge redistribution, which effectively activates the conjugated structure to facilitate the oxygen adsorption, while 2D exfoliated sheet–like structure favors the sufficient exposure of active sites. As a result, the inherent ORR activity of C4N is fully explored. When evaluated as metal–free ORR catalyst, C4NNSs, with conductive carbon additives, display excellent ORR performance, much superior to the bulk C4N and even comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Theoretical calculation reveals that the active sites of C4NNSs are mainly located on the positively–charged area adjacent to pyrazine–nitrogen. Bulk C4N was first synthesized by the one–pot solvothermal reaction between Hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate (HKH) and 3,3′,4,4′–biphenyltetramine (BPTA) in a mixture solution of methanol (MeOH) and N–Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) at 175 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the as–synthesized bulk C4N was subjected to the acidic etching under sonication to produce exfoliated thin nanosheets in an isolated yield of 56% (C4NNSs, Fig. 1 ). The chemical structure and bonding configuration of as–produced bulk C4N were first characterized by the Fourier transform infrared (FT–IR) and solid–state 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (a), the IR spectra of the starting precursors of HKH and BPTA are distinct from that of C4N. The carbonyl group (C = O) at 1637 cm−1 for HKH disappears while the characteristic band at 1612 cm−1 assigned to C = N stretching in pyrazine rings appears, confirming the formation of the C4N chemical structure [26]. In the solid–state 13C NMR spectra, C4N exhibited two NMR signals located at 129 and 141 ppm attributed to the C = C carbons of benzene rings and the C = N carbons in pyrazine rings of C4N, respectively, and no residual carbonyl signal around 190 ppm of the starting monomer HKH was observed [27], which further verify the successful generation of the C4N structure (Fig. 2(b)). The Elemental analysis (EA) result (Table S1) manifests the molar ratio (4:1) of C to N atoms in the as–produced C4N. Based on the above results, one possible chemical structure of bulk C4N is proposed in Fig. 2(c). The surface morphology of the C4N polymer was examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observation. As can be observed from Fig. 3 (a), the bulk C4N shows a stacked, thick sheet–like structure. In stark contrast, C4NNSs exhibit graphene–like thin–sheet morphology (Fig. 3b), verifying the efficient exfoliation of the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, C4NNSs display similar powder X–ray diffraction (XRD) pattern with the bulk sample featuring a broad diffraction peak at 25.6° (Fig. S1) [26], while the FT–IR spectrum of C4NNSs present almost identical signals with respect to the bulk C4N (Fig. 3(c)). The composition and chemical bonding of samples were further probed by X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. (Figs. 3(d, e) and S2). The high–resolution C 1s spectrum of C4NNSs contains two component peaks at 284.5 and 285.6 eV, corresponding to C–C and C–N bond, respectively, while its high–resolution N 1s spectrum can be fitted into a dominant component peak at 398.8 eV attributed to pyrazine–like N–C signal together with a rather weak –NH2 signal arising from residual –NH2 groups [20]. Notably, no marked XPS spectra change between C4NNSs and bulk C4N is observed. Taken together, the above result indicates that the chemical structure of C4N largely retains unchanged after one–pot exfoliation. Fig. 3(f) presents the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) curve of C4NNSs. The UV–vis DRS of C4N exhibits a characteristic absorption band at around 500 nm due to n→π* transition. Further, the optical band gap of C4N was determined using a Tauc plot, which was derived from UV–vis DRS results by plotting a curve between (αhν)2 vs hν (α is the absorption coefficient, h is the plank constant and ν is the light frequency) and the linear extrapolation tangent of the curve to abscissa. From the Tauc plot, the value of band gap of C4N was estimated to be 1.41 eV, which is well in the range of semiconductor band gaps and smaller than previous reported carbon nitride materials [28]. The electrocatalytic performance of the as–prepared catalysts was evaluated in a typical three–electrode system in an oxygen–saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Prior to test, the polymeric samples were mixed with conductive carbon additive such as graphene nanosheets (G) to improve the charge transfer similar to the literature [23]. The carbon additive and the commercial Pt/C catalyst were also used for comparison. As indicated by linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) curves at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm with the potential range between 0 V and 1.0 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in Fig. 4 (a), clearly, both G and bulk C4N/G have poor ORR activities with inferior onset potential (0.81 and 0.80 V) and low limiting current density (3 and 2.7 mA cm−2). In sharp contrast, C4NNSs/G exhibits more positive onset potential and much larger limiting current density, superior to most reported polymeric ORR catalysts (Fig. 4(a) and Table S2) and even comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst, which indicates excellent ORR activity of C4NNSs/G. Furthermore, the ORR performance is further demonstrated by the Tafel slope. As can be seen from Fig. 4(b), the C4NNSs/G catalyst has a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1, much lower than those of bulk C4N/G (98 mV dec−1) and G (103 mV dec−1) and even superior to Pt/C (77 mV dec−1), indicating excellent ORR reaction kinetics of C4NNSs/G. The LSV curves of samples were also recorded with a rotation rate from 400 to 2500 rpm (Figs. 4(c) and S3). The electron transfer number (n) was determined based on Koutechy–Levich (K–L) equation. The n value for C4NNSs/G reaches 3.72, larger than those of bulk C4N/G (3.05) and G (2.55), suggesting a nearly 4–electron ORR reaction pathway for C4NNSs/G (Fig. 4(d,e)). The electrochemical stability of C4NNSs/G was evaluated by the continuous amperometric current–time (i–t) test in O2 –saturated 0.1 M KOH at 1600 rpm. As can be seen from Fig. 4(f), C4NNSs/G maintains 91% catalytic current after 34,000 s of continuous test, superior to Pt/C with the current retention of 81% under identical conditions. The methanol–tolerance property of electrocatalysts is also important for commercialization of fuel cells. Compared to Pt/C, the current density of C4NNSs/G showed negligible changes after the addition of MeOH, which reflects good anti–methanol poisoning property (Fig. S4). Summarizing the comparison of ORR performance above, it can be concluded that sheet–like C4NNSs exhibit remarkably improved ORR activity relative to the bulk counterpart and the G additive. Considering G alone has rather poor ORR activity, we suppose that G serves as only the conductive additive for improved charge transfer while C4NNSs provide abundant exposed ORR active sites. To find out the origin of the excellent activity, we measured the electrochemical double–layer capacitance (C DL) of samples, which is often linearly proportional to the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) [29,30]. As shown in Fig. S5, C4NNSs/G exhibits larger ECSA of 16.07 cm−2 relative to the bulk C4N/G (10.66 cm−1), implying the high exposure of effective active sites of C4NNSs/G. Moreover, we conducted LSV tests with the addition of KSCN into the electrolyte to confirm the metal–free catalytic sites of C4NNSs/G [23], as can be seen in Fig. S6, both the onset potential and current density exhibit negligible changes after adding SCN- into the KOH electrolyte. Of note, semiconductive C4NNSs have a smaller band gap of 1.41 eV with respect to other reported C2N and C3N4 materials [21,28], while smaller band gap facilitates the greater filling of the bonding orbitals with a lower overpotential, favorable for the ORR [31]. Generally, it has been demonstrated that oxygen molecules are initially adsorbed on the catalyst surface during the electrocatalytic ORR. That is to say, the adsorption energy of oxygen is crucial for the ORR activity. To provide some insights into oxygen binding, we performed density function theory (DFT) calculations to study the oxygen adsorption on different sites of C4NNSs. In our case, due to electron accepting ability of nitrogen, pyrazine–nitrogen species uniformly distributed throughout C4NNSs induce the charge redistribution via intramolecular charge transfer and create the positive charge density on the areas adjacent to those pyrazine–nitrogen atoms, evidenced by Mulliken charge analysis (Fig. 5(a,b)). In our case, there are nine kinds of possible adsorption sites on the C4NNSs surface (Fig. 5c). Among them, the positively–charged sites (A, B, C, F, G, I) present negative adsorption energy values–favorable for oxygen adsorption and activation, and can be considered as ORR active sites, similar to some reported nitrogen–doped carbon systems [12,13]. By comparing all possible adsorption sites (Fig. 5(c) and Table S3), it is found that the F and G sites adjacent to pyrazine–nitrogen display the most negative adsorption energy of −0.48 kcal/mol. Thus, the F and G sites can be regarded as the optimal active sites (Figs. 5(d) and S7). In summary, we have demonstrated the first synthesis of 2D pyrazine–based sheet–like C4N via one–pot liquid phase exfoliation from bulk C4N and explored their inherent electrocatalytic property for the ORR. The resultant C4NNSs were endowed with a small band gap of 1.41 eV, dense and uniformly–distributed pyrazine–nitrogen moieties and high density of exposed active sites. As a result, C4NNSs can be used as an efficient organic ORR catalyst to demonstrate comparable electrocatalytic activity but better stability and methanol–tolerance ability with respect to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. DFT calculations reveal that the pyrazine nitrogen species can induce charge density redistribution to create rich positively charged sites adjacent to pyrazine–nitrogen as the ORR active sites, while the sheet–like C4N structure renders sufficient exposure of active sites. Our recent findings not only highlight a new type of nitrogen–containing conjugated polymer nanosheet but also provide some insights into the design of metal–free polymeric ORR catalysts. The new 2D C4NNSs demonstrated herein will not only enrich the family members of 2D conjugated polymer nanosheets but also opens up exciting opportunities to C4N research for a wide range of applications.
