Graphical abstract The nano-sized Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solution over silica support exhibits stable catalytic activity for the dehydration of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene in vapour phase under normal atmospheric pressure. The thermal and textural stability of the catalyst was investigated by means of XRD, HREM, XPS and BET surface area methods to correlate with the catalytic properties. Surface stabilized nano-sized ceria–zirconia solid solution on silica support was synthesized through a soft chemical route using colloidal silica dispersion and nitrate precursors of cerium and zirconium. The dispersion and structural stability of the Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solution after thermal treatments at 773 and 1073K was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET surface area techniques. Catalytic performance of the synthesized Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 sample was tested for the conversion of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene in the vapour phase under normal atmospheric pressure. From XRD measurements, the presence of cubic phases of the composition Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 were identified. The former phase was noted at 773K and the later phases at 1073K indicating enrichment of zirconium in the cubic fluorite type ceria lattice at higher calcination temperature. HREM results revealed existence of very small Ce–Zr mixed oxide crystallites of ∼5nm size over amorphous silica at 773K. No appreciable increase in the size of the crystallites was noticed even after calcination at 1073K. XPS measurements indicated significant amount of Ce3+ present in the samples. All the characterization techniques revealed that silica does not form any unwanted inert compounds with the dispersed Ce–Zr-oxides. The activity studies reveal that the Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a high and stable activity in the time-on-stream experiments with good product selectivity to 4-methylpent-1-ene. Also a significant decrease in the reaction temperature corresponding to 50% conversion is noted over this catalyst. Keywords Ceria–zirconia Solid solution Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 XRD HREM XPS 4-Methylpentan-2-ol 4-Methylpent-1-ene 1 Introduction Cerium dioxide, the most studied oxide material among all the rare earth elements has received tremendous research interest recently due to its application in various fields including catalysis and materials science [1,2]. The most important property that makes the ceria remarkable is its oxygen storage and release capacity via the redox shift between Ce4+ and Ce3+ under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. Therefore, ceria containing oxides have been profitably employed in the automotive pollution abatement three-way catalytic converters (TWC). Pure ceria alone exhibits poor thermal stability and susceptible to sintering at high temperatures leading to catalyst deactivation [3]. Therefore, several CeO2-based mixed oxide systems have been investigated to overcome the disadvantages associated with the unsupported cerium oxide [4]. Ceria easily forms solid solutions with transition metals and other rare-earth elements. It has been established that introduction of zirconium into the ceria lattice greatly enhances the surface area, thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity resulting superior catalytic properties. Hence, ceria–zirconia solid solutions have been investigated with huge interest among other ceria-based mixed oxides [5–7]. Typical catalytic applications of these oxides include partial oxidation of methane to generate hydrogen for fuel cell applications [9], CO2 reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas [10], direct oxidation of methane in the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) [11], steam reforming of ethanol [12] and hydrodesulfurization sorbents [13]. The conversion of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene is an important reaction from the practical viewpoint as an alternative route to the production of 4-methylpent-1-ene, a monomer for the manufacture of thermoplastic polymers of superior technological properties. Unsupported forms of Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solutions have been employed for this reaction [14,15]. It was observed that the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts exhibit good catalytic activity and the acid–base character of the catalyst is most important in order to obtain high selectivity to the desired 1-alkene and to avoid the formation of olefins with internal double bonds and the dehydrogenation product ketone. Despite their wide applicability for various reactions, the unsupported forms of Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solutions are known to suffer from typical disadvantages such as low specific surface area, low thermal resistance to sintering and low structural/textural stability during high temperature applications [8]. The present investigation was undertaken to over come the deficiencies of the Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solutions and explore them for various catalytic applications. In this study, a high surface area and stable Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 nano-composite catalyst (CZ/S) was synthesized via a deposition precipitation technique employing aqueous colloidal silica dispersions. The synthesized catalyst, calcined at various temperatures, was characterized using XRD, HREM, XPS and BET surface area techniques, and evaluated for its catalytic performance towards the dehydration of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene in the vapour phase under normal atmospheric pressure. An attempt was also made to correlate the enhanced reactivity with the structural features of this catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The CeO2-ZrO2/SiO2 catalyst (1:1:2 mole ratio based on oxides) was synthesized by a deposition precipitation method. Nitrate precursors, ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (Loba Chemie, GR grade) and zirconium(IV) nitrate (Fluka, AR grade) in requisite quantities were dissolved separately in deionized water and mixed together. To the aforementioned mixture solution, required quantity of colloidal silica (Ludox 40wt.%, Aldrich, AR grade) was added under vigorous stirring. Dilute aqueous ammonia solution was added dropwise with vigorous stirring until the precipitation was complete (pH 8.5). The resulting product was filtered off, washed several times with deionized water, oven dried at 383K for 12h, and then calcined at 773K for 5h in air atmosphere. Some portions of the finished sample were once again heated at 1073K for 5h in air atmosphere in order to study the structural/textural stability of the catalyst. 2.2 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Siemens D500 diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. Crystalline phases in the samples were identified by matching experimental patterns with the PDF-ICDD files. The mean crystallite size was estimated by applying Scherrer equation. The ‘a’ cell parameter was calculated by a standard cubic indexation method, using the intensity of the base peak (111) [16]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using Shimadzu (ESCA 3400) spectrometer equipped with Mg Kα (1253.6eV) source. Charging of the samples was corrected by setting the binding energy of adventitious carbon (C 1s) at 284.6eV [17]. The XPS analysis was done at ambient temperature and pressures typically below 10−6 Pa. The BET surface area measurements were made using a Gemini 2360 instrument. Prior to analysis, samples were degassed at 393K under vacuum for 8h to remove residual moisture and other volatiles. HREM investigations were performed using a Philips CM200 electron microscope with 0.23nm point-to-point resolution. The samples were supported on a holey carbon copper grid by dropping ethanol suspensions containing the uniformly dispersed oxide powers. 2.3 Catalytic activity The dehydration of 4-methylpentan-2-ol was investigated in the vapour phase under normal atmospheric pressure, in a down flow fixed bed micro-reactor, at different temperatures. In a typical experiment ca. 0.5g of catalyst sample was secured between two plugs of quartz wool inside the quartz micro-reactor (i.d. 0.8cm) and above the catalyst bed filled with ceramic beads in order to act as preheating zone. The reactor was placed vertically inside a tubular furnace, which can be heated electrically. The reactor temperature was monitored by a thermocouple with its tip located near the catalyst bed and connected to a temperature indicator-controller. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was preheated at 773K for 6h under CO2-free airflow. The 4-methylpentan-2-ol was fed with N2 stream, with the time factor 0.5gcatalyst/galcohol. The condensed liquid products were analysed qualitatively by NMR and MS techniques and quantitatively by gas chromatography. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as per the procedure described elsewhere [18]. 3 Results and discussion The powder XRD patterns of CZ/S sample calcined at 773 and 1073K are shown in Fig. 1 . As can be noted from this figure, sample calcined at 773K exhibits poor crystallinity. Only broad diffraction lines due to the cubic fluorite type phase with the composition Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (PDF-ICDD 28-0271) could be identified. With increase of calcination temperature from 773 to 1073K, there is an upward shift in the peak positions and the lines due to the presence of Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 (PDF-ICDD 38-1439) and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (PDF-ICDD 38-1436) phases could be inferred indicating incorporation of more zirconium into the cerium oxide unit cell at higher calcination temperature. This observation is further supported by a decrease in the cell ‘a’ parameter value from 5.35 to 5.26Å with increasing calcination temperature from 773 to 1073K (Table 1 ). According to Vegard's law, a decrease of lattice parameter or cell volume is expected due to insertion of more quantity of Zr4+ into the CeO2 lattice, since the ionic radius of Zr4+ (0.084nm) is smaller than that of Ce4+ (0.097nm) [16]. There is no evidence for the formation of t-ZrO2 or m-ZrO2 phases of zirconia within the detection limits of the XRD technique. Additionally, the XRD features of silica are not apparent, indicating the amorphous nature of the support. Though the formation of mixed phases between ceria–silica and zirconia–silica namely, Ce9.33(SiO2)6O2 and ZrSiO4, respectively, are well-established in the literature [19,20], no such phases were noted in the present investigation. This observation clearly reveals the suitability of silica as an inert support for the dispersion of ceria–zirconia solid solutions. The non-appearance of these mixed compounds could be attributed to an intimate interaction between the Ce- and Zr-oxides leading to the formation of solid solutions and the inert character of the colloidal silica. The average crystallite size of Ce–Zr-oxides in the CZ/S sample, as a function of calcination temperature is summarized in Table 1. With increase in calcination temperature a small increase in the average crystallite size is noted. This observation clearly signifies the remarkable ability of silica to prevent agglomeration of Ce x Zr1−x O2 to form bigger crystallites. Such an influence of silica is also reflected in the specific surface areas of these oxides. A high BET surface area of 112m2 g−1 is retained even after the calcination at 1073K (Table 1). The TEM global picture along with HREM image and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) of the 773K calcined sample is presented in Fig. 2 . A closer view of the images reveals existence of small crystals of the size ∼5nm dispersed over an amorphous silica matrix. The broadening of the rings in the electron diffraction patterns accounts for the presence of such small randomly oriented mixed oxide particles. The TEM and HREM images of the sample calcined at 1073K are presented in Fig. 3 , which reveal a well-dispersed, smaller Ce–Zr-oxide particles over the surface of the amorphous silica. Even after 1073K calcination treatment, there was no apparent increase in the size of the Ce–Zr-oxide particles. These conclusions are drawn both from the observation of a few experimental images and the analysis of the selected area electron diffraction patterns. The fringes that appear in the micrograph allow for identification of the crystallographic spacings of the Ce x Zr1−x O2 nano-crystallites. Lattice fringes of around 3Å were extensively observed on very small well-dispersed particles supported on the amorphous contrast for both the cases. The absence of additional electron diffraction rings pertaining to the tetragonal and monoclinic phases clearly indicates that the Ce–Zr-oxides are mainly in the cubic structure [16,21]. From the observation of experimental images and the analysis of the selected area electron diffraction patterns, it can be inferred that there was no apparent increase in the size of the Ce–Zr-oxide particles (∼5nm) up on increase of calcination temperature from 773 to 1073K. Thus, the HREM results fairly support the observations made from XRD studies. The Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 sample was further analysed by XPS technique to verify the elemental oxidation states. The electron binding energies of O 1s, Ce 3d, Zr 3d and Si 2p are presented in Table 2 . Fig. 4 displays the Ce 3d spectra of the CZ/S sample calcined at two different temperatures. The photoelectron peak shapes and the corresponding binding energies are sensitive to the calcination temperature. The binding energy values obtained for O 1s, Zr 3d and Si 2p are in agreement with the literature reports and clearly indicate the absence of pure ZrO2 (182.9eV) [17,22] and other inert compounds such as CeSiO4 and ZrSiO4 which can be identified with the Si 2p binding energy value at 101eV [17,23]. The notation of Burroughs et al. [24] as envisaged in the literature, could be used to elucidate the Ce 3d peaks as shown in Fig. 4. Two sets of spin-orbital multiplets, corresponding to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 contributions were labeled as u and v, respectively. The peaks labeled v and v″ have been assigned to a mixing of Ce 3d9 4f2 O 2p4 and Ce 3d9 4f1 O 2p5 Ce(IV) final states, and the peak denoted v″′ corresponds to the Ce 3d9 4f0 O 2p6 Ce(IV) final state. Likewise, lines v0 and v′ are assigned to Ce 3d9 4f2 O 2p5 and Ce 3d9 4f1O 2p6 of Ce(III). The same assignment could be applied to the u structures, which correspond to the Ce 3d3/2 levels. As the calcination temperature increases the intensity of the u‴ peak decreased and intensity of the u′ and v′ annotated peaks increased, indicating an increase in the surface content of Ce3+. However, the presence of Ce2O3 (Ce3+) was not observed from the XRD measurements. The dehydration of 4-methylpentan-2-ol may lead to different products and the composition of the product mixture depends on the mechanistic pathway of the reaction on the catalyst surface. This involves three types of mechanisms viz., concerted elimination pathway (E2), formation of carbocation (E1) and carbanion formation via two-point mechanism (E1cB) [22,23]. These mechanisms should be regarded as limiting cases, since intermediate situations can occur. The carbanion route leads to the main product of terminal olefin (desired product) accompanied by the formation of small amount of ketones due to inevitable side reactions. On the other hand the operation of E1 mechanism (carbocation route) gives the undesired 2-ene as the main product with negligible amount of ketones. The concerted pathway (E2 mechanism) increases the yield of 2-ene in comparison to that of the desired terminal olefin, i.e. 4-methylpent-1-ene (Hofmann product). Cutrufello et al. and Solinas et al. [14,15] through their pioneering work have demonstrated that the E1cB route sets in for the case of ceria rich combinations in general, while zirconia rich combinations lead to mainly E2 path, thus resulting the desired and undesired products, respectively. Keeping these points in mind, the Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 composite catalyst mainly consisting of Ce rich phases, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, were synthesized in the present investigation. The obtained product selectivity over the 773K calcined catalyst as shown in Fig. 5 , is in good agreement with the literature reports and obviously correlates well with earlier proposed concepts [25]. The selectivity of the desired product 4-methylpent-1-ene decreases from 85 to 57% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 533 to 673K. The selectivity of 4-methylpentan-2-one increased from 6 to 28% indicating that at higher temperatures dehydration (side reaction of the E1cB) is more facile, which leads to the decrease in the selectivity of the desired product. However, the selectivity of 2-ene (Saytzeff product) does not show any appreciable change with increasing reaction temperature. This indicates that the E1 route (carbocation formation due to removal of hydroxyl group) does not gain more prominence revealing that the major reaction path could be carbanionic (E1cB). One of the interesting observations from the present study is the lowering of reaction temperature at which 50% conversion occurs. The unsupported Ce–Zr mixed oxides with the combination of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phases having the crystallite size of ∼10nm exhibited 50% conversion at a temperature of 633K [23], while the silica stabilized Ce–Zr-oxides of below 5nm (present study) indicate a temperature of 545K for the same conversion with slightly better product distribution, which is intriguing. The decrease of temperature corresponding to 50% conversion could be attributed to the reduced crystallite size of the Ce–Zr-oxides, which exhibit increased reactivity due to very small size. An important clue has been observed from the XPS study, which reveals the presence of a significant amount of Ce3+. The presence of Ce3+ may lead to an increase in the ability of the O2− oxide ions to abstract a proton in comparison to O2− oxide ions connected to Ce4+ and hence a carbanionic route (E1cB) could be facilitated as depicted below: where M4+ =Ce4+ or Zr4+; M3+ =Ce3+. As presented in Fig. 6 , the Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 composite catalyst shows excellent performance in the time-on-stream experiments revealing the stable catalytic activity without deactivation. Recent literature reveals that ceria-based mixed oxides, especially ceria–zirconia combinations are highly coke resistant and exhibit promising stable activity without deactivation during time-on-stream runs for various reactions [9–11,26]. This was mainly attributed to the availability of lattice oxygen due to oxygen storage and release property of the Ce–Zr-oxides [14,26]. Thus, the present study indicates that amorphous silica can be used as an inert support to stabilize the Ce–Zr-oxide nano-sized crystallites against sintering at elevated temperatures that leads to a remarkable increase in the reactivity. Understanding complete structural features of the synthesized catalysts still remains difficult owing to very limited available literature and complexity arising due to the inherent heterogeneity of such systems. Hence further in-depth investigations on the local structure, directed towards improvement of the yield and selectivity are in active progress. 4 Conclusions Surface stabilized nano-crystalline solid solutions of ceria–zirconia over silica support have been synthesized by a soft chemical route and were examined by various techniques after calcination at 773 and 1073K. XRD measurements revealed the presence of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 at 773K and Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phases at 1073K indicating more incorporation of zirconium into the ceria lattice at higher calcination temperature. HREM results indicated a well-dispersed nano-sized Ce–Zr-oxides (∼5nm) over the surface of amorphous silica. Particularly, the crystallite size does not show appreciable increase with increase of calcination temperature from 773 to 1073K. XRD and HREM analysis further revealed the absence of ZrO2, CeSiO4, ZrSiO4 and Ce9.33(SiO2)6O2 in the prepared Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 nano-composite catalyst, throwing light on the superiority of the deposition precipitation technique adopted and the advantage of the colloidal silica being employed in this study. XPS study indicated the presence of appreciable amount of Ce3+ in the catalyst at both calcination temperatures. The highly stabilized and nano-crystalline Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 composite catalyst exhibited a high activity for the conversion of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene and showed stable catalytic performance during the time-on-stream runs without deactivation. Also a significant fall in the reaction temperature corresponding to 50% conversion was observed over this composite catalyst. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Y. Yamada, AIST-Osaka, Japan and Dr. A.

        "dc:description": "Surface stabilized nano-sized ceria–zirconia solid solution on silica support was synthesized through a soft chemical route using colloidal silica dispersion and nitrate precursors of cerium and zirconium. The dispersion and structural stability of the Ce x Zr1−x O2 solid solution after thermal treatments at 773 and 1073K was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET surface area techniques. Catalytic performance of the synthesized Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 sample was tested for the conversion of 4-methylpentan-2-ol to 4-methylpent-1-ene in the vapour phase under normal atmospheric pressure. From XRD measurements, the presence of cubic phases of the composition Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 were identified. The former phase was noted at 773K and the later phases at 1073K indicating enrichment of zirconium in the cubic fluorite type ceria lattice at higher calcination temperature. HREM results revealed existence of very small Ce–Zr mixed oxide crystallites of ∼5nm size over amorphous silica at 773K. No appreciable increase in the size of the crystallites was noticed even after calcination at 1073K. XPS measurements indicated significant amount of Ce3+ present in the samples. All the characterization techniques revealed that silica does not form any unwanted inert compounds with the dispersed Ce–Zr-oxides. The activity studies reveal that the Ce x Zr1−x O2/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a high and stable activity in the time-on-stream experiments with good product selectivity to 4-methylpent-1-ene. Also a significant decrease in the reaction temperature corresponding to 50% conversion is noted over this catalyst.",
