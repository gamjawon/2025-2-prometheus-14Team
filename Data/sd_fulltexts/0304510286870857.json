OCCELLI** Gulf Research & Development Company, P.O. Drawer 2038, Pittsburgh, PA 15230 (USA) (Received October 21, 1986, accepted January 15, 1986) Summary Clay catalysts have been prepared using reagents different from the aluminum chlorhydrate solution usually employed to pillar smectite minerals. Colloidal alumina, alumina-coated silica and solutions containing chlorhydrated complexes of zirconium and aluminum produced pillared bentomtes which, upon calcination at 400 C, formed microporous two- dimensional structures with 200 - 500 m2 g~1 Langmuir surface area and basal spacing between 17 and 18 A. These pillared clays contain both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites; above 300 C, pyridine is retained pre- dominantly on Lewis centers. The presence of zirconia seems to enhance Bronsted acidity, whereas pillaring with colloidal alumina particles increases the catalyst Lewis acidity. Cracking activity for gas oil conversion depends mainly on the surface area generated by pillaring. Pillared bentonites are more active but less selective than similarly prepared pillared hectorite catalysts. Introduction With the development of petroleum refining and chemical production, the 1984 value of the worldwide catalyst consumption surpassed the two billion dollar mark (Chemical Week, June 26, 1984). Catalyst suppliers, as well as chemical and petroleum companies are constantly engaged in devel- oping new catalysts capable of generating the technological advantage necessary to compete in the marketplace. Because of low cost and high cracking activity, pillared clays have been receiving considerable attention from the petroleum engineer. * Based on a paper presented at the 8th International Clay Conference, Denver, CO, July 1986. **Present address UNOCAL Corporation, UNOCAL Science & Technology Division, P 0. Box 76, Brea, CA 92621 0304-6102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 378 Pillared clay catalysts are smectite minerals whose silicate layers have been permanently propped 7 - 9 A apart by the introduction of polyoxo- cations of aluminum [1-3] or zirconium [4]. The fairly homogeneous distribution of pillars in the interlayered space generates an array of rectangular openings about 8 X 15 A in size [5, 6], so that clay catalysts can behave like two-dimensional molecular sieves [7]. Consequently, gasoline yields from gas oil cracking approximate those obtained with zeolite- containing fluid cracking catalysts (FCC); the light cycle gas oil (LOGO, used as heating oil) selectivity is attributed to the larger pore dimension [8]. The microspace generated by pillaring is thermally stable in the temperature range used in most petroleum refining applications such as hydrotreating; however, better hydrothermal stability (and carbon selectivity) is required for fluid cracking operations. This paper describes the physicochemical properties of bentonites pillared with mixed zirconia-alumina clusters and with colloidal alumina and alumina-coated silica particles. Cracking activity and product selectivities from gas oil conversion will be compared to those of similarly prepared pillared hectorites and delaminated clay catalysts. Experimental Catalyst preparation A Wyoming bentonite (containing ~90% montmorillonite) was reacted with an excess of aqueous zirconyl chloride (ZCH), aluminum chlorhydrox- ide (ACH) and ZrAl chlorhydroxide (ZACH) solution (Chlorhydrol and Rezal 67 , from the Reheis Chemical Company), with submicron alumina- coated silica (ALSI) and with colloidal alumina (CAL) (Nalco's ISJ-612 and ISJ-614) particles in a manner described elsewhere [9]. In all the prepara- tions, the pH of the clay slurry was adjusted to that of the pillaring solution. Chemical composition, surface area, as well as X-ray diffractograms are provided in the reference given [9]. Catalyst characterization A DIGISORB 2600 from Micromeritics Instrument Corporation was used to measure N; sorption, Langmuir and BET surface area and pore size distributions. Mercury penetration porosimetry measurements were performed using a Quantachrome porosimeter; catalysts were pretreated at 400 C (m yacuo) for 4 h. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were obtained with a DuPont 1090 thermogravi- metric analyzer using heating rates of 20 C min~1 and 10 C min\"1, respec- tively. Air (50 cm3 mm\"1) was used as a purge gas; sample weight was ~35mg. Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained with a DuPont 1100 spectrometer. Self-supporting wafers were prepared by pressing 15-mg samples on a 13 mm diameter die for one minute at ~8000 Ib. Prior to pyridine sorption, the 379 wafers were mounted in an optical cell and degassed by heating at 300 C for 10 h at 10~1 torr. The pyridine-loaded wafers were then heated (in vacua) in the 100 - 500 C temperature range for periods of 1 h and the spectra recorded for each temperature. X-ray powder patterns were obtained with a standard Philips diffractometer equipped with a pulse height analyzer, using Cu KQ; radiation. Catalyst testing The catalyst's cracking activity was evaluated with a flow system similar to that described by Ciapetta and Henderson [10]. Feedstock was a gas oil (260 - 426 C boiling range) containing 23.0 wt.% furnace oil and 74.3 wt.% slurry oil. The charge consisted of 2.5 g of 100 X 325 mesh granules calcined in air in the 300 - 800 C temperature range. Typical test conditions were: 515 C reactor temperature, 80 s contact time, and 15 WHSV. Percent con- version is defined as: (Y( Vp) 1001 Vf where Vf is the volume of fresh feed (FF) cracked and Vp is the volume of product boiling above 204 C. Cracking activity is defined as: % Conversion^ 100 % Conversion). Results and discussion Thermal analysis Reaction of bentonite with polyoxycations of Al, AlZr and Zr or with colloidal alumina and (alumina coated) colloidal silica particles, produces clays that, upon dehydroxylation (at 400 C/4 h in air), have basal spacing of 17.0 -19.0 A, Langmuir surface areas between 200 and 500 m2 g~1 and 0.16 - 0.20 cm3 g~1 N; pore volume.

In contrast, ZCH- bentonite prepared from diluting a commercially available ZrOCI; solution (obtained from Magnesium Elektron, Inc.) does not contain long range clay sheets stacking [9]; its high Langmuir surface area (314 m2 g~1) is thought to result from face-to-edge and edge-to-edge layer interactions like those used by Pinnavaia [11] to describe the structure of delaminated clays. The ACH- bentonite high Langmuir surface area (496 m2 g~1) has been attributed to the method used in preparing the finished catalyst [9]; thermal stability and X-ray data are given elsewhere [9]. After heating in air, pillared bentonites retain most of their catalytically active surface area up to 500 - 600 C; stability (as determined by losses of surface area and cracking activity with the severity of the thermal pretreat- 380 300 400 500 600 700 800 CALCINATION TEMPERATURE ( C) Fig 1 Effects of pretreatment temperature (4 h, in air) on gas oil conversion. ment in air) seems to be independent of the pillaring agent used (Fig. 1). Because of lower (212 m2 g~1) surface area, ALSI-bentonite is the least active catalyst prepared. If air is replaced by a 95% steam-5% nitrogen mixture, stability is reduced; between 590 and 650 C these clay catalysts' microporosity collapses, with loss of surface properties and catalytic activity. Thermogravimetric (TGA) curves in Fig. 2 show the pillared bentonites' weight to decrease monotonically with temperature due to loss of water sorbed on the external surface and in the microspace generated by pillaring. The derivatives of the TGA curves suggest that pillar dehydroxylation occurs between 200 and 400 C; between 600 C and 1100 C, there is an additional weight change attributed to removal of water resulting from dehydroxyla- tion of the crystal lattice. In contrast, the major weight change in the starting bentonite is due mainly to dehydroxylation reactions occurring at ~550 C, (Fig. 2a). The ZCH-bentonite's greater weight loss (Fig. 2e) is attributed to the clay's greater (0.20 cm3 g~1) N2 pore volume. The differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves in Fig. 3 and X-ray diffractograms in Fig. 4 show the occurrence and identification of the major phases formed on heating.

The exotherm at 945 C is attributed to spinel, albite (NaAlSi30s), quartz and cristobalite formation. Calcining ACH-bentonite produces an exotherm at 915 C due to high tem- perature quartz formation (Fig. 3b); its DTA profile is similar to that of ZACH-bentonite (Fig. 3c). The exotherm at 925 C in Fig. 3c is attributed to quartz and zirconia, which are the major phases formed upon calcining the Zr-containing pillared bentonites in air (Figs. 4c and 4d). The two exotherms (at 870 and 941 C) observed when heating ZCH-bentonite could represent a transition from metastable tetragonal (or metastable cubic), to stable monoclinic ZrO;, see Fig. 3d. The exotherm at 938 C in ALSI- bentonite represents quartz formation. Fig. 3e. Infrared analysis High surface area and open microporosity is not a sufficient condition for catalytic (cracking) activity in solids. In fact, a sample of Laponite-B (a synthetic hectorite from Laporte Industries, Ltd.) was found to have 380 m2 g~1 BET surface area but little (0.43) cracking activity for gas oil conversion. Reaction of this synthetic clay with aluminum chlorhydrate solutions changed its surface area slightly (up to 420 from 380 m2 g~1), however its cracking activity increased to 2.3 from 0.43. The catalytically active material retained pyridine on Lewis acid sites even after degassing in vacua for 2 h at 300 C, whereas the parent laponite lost its physisorbed pyridine at ~100 C. Infrared spectra in Figs. 5 - 8 are typical of those obtained with the pyridine-loaded clay catalysts. Bands at 1635 -1637,1542 -1544 and 1488 - 1490 cm\"1 are indicative of pyridinium ion formation [12]. The 1542- (SIINO Ayvyiiaav) aonvauosav r- i oo 1^1 X M .SP U .SP ^ fa N En < 385 1544 cm\"1 bands have been assigned to ^\"\"\" H groups, that at ~1490 cm\"1 to both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites [12]. These bands decrease in mtensity with temperature. At 300 C, bands at 1635 -1637 cm\"1 almost disappear; between 300 and 400 C the intensities of bands representing Bronsted acid sites are reduced significantly. At 400 C, pyridine on Bronsted acid sites can be seen only on ZACH and ZCH-bentonite, (Figs. 6c - 7c) and on ACH-bentonite [14]. Pillaring with colloidal alumina (in place of [All304(OH)24(H20)l2]+7 cations) increases Lewis acidity, whereas the presence of zirconia in the pillared structure seems to increase the catalyst Bronsted acid strength: CAL ACH ZACH ZCH ALSI L/B 6?7L9L3L22.5 Lewis to Bronsted (L/B) site ratios have been estimated from the ratio of the area of the bands at about 1450 and 1543 cm\"! after degassing the pyridine loaded wafers at 200 C/2 h. The low pH (<4.0) used in preparing ZACH and ZCH bentonites could have generated Si OH' Al(IV) groups in the clay tetrahedral layer, enhancing the catalyst Bronsted acidity [13]. The L/B ratio in CAL-bentonite may have been increased by the presence of residual alumina (from the washing step) outside the interlamellar space of the clay. Acidity results mainly from dehydroxylation of the large interlayering cations which prop apart the silicate layers. On heating, these polyoxo- cations form oxide clusters (though containing Lewis acid sites) and protons which are retained as charge-compensating cations. Intensities of bands assigned to coordinated pyridine (at 1605 - 1620 and 1445 -1453 cm\"1) are less temperature-sensitive in the 200 - 400 C temperature range. ALSI-bentonite acid strength is somewhat lower. It loses pyridine between 300 and 400 C (Fig. 8), whereas evidence for some chemisorbed pyridine is still present at 500 C in the other clay catalysts. In summary, like bentonites (and hectorites) pillared with hydroxyaluminum oligomers [14,15], these clay catalysts, after drying at 300 C in uacuo, contain both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites; however above 300 C, pyridine is retained predominantly on Lewis centers. Crack ing p roperties As observed in pillared hectorites [15], cracking activity for gas oil conversion depends mainly on the catalyst residual surface area after thermal pretreatment. Greater cracking activity (and surface area) is observed in bentonites pillared with Al203-clusters, and the procedure used in forming the catalyst was found to affect catalyst properties [9]. The dependences of cracking properties on surface area is shown in Fig. Fig. 9. Because of their greater surface area, these pillared bentonites can exhibit activity values as high as 5.7, whereas activity in similarly prepared hectorite catalysts did not exceed 2.3.

(resulting from stacking disorder) is believed responsible for the pillared bentonites' cracking activity being greater than (pillared and delaminated) hectorite catalysts with the same surface area, Fig. 9. In the conversion range investigated, hectorite catalysts produce more gasoline and light cycle gas oil. Fig. 10. Selectivity to LCGO results from the catalyst ability to crack more of the heavier fraction (slurry oil, SO) as shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 13 shows the dependence of carbon make on conversion, and that pillared bentonites with 3 - 4% Fea03 impurities generate as much car- bon as a pillared hectorite containing less than 0.3% Fe^Oy. Iron is probably buried in the montmorillonite octahedral layer in sites isomorphous with aluminum where it cannot participate in the cracking process. The cracking properties of hectorite catalysts prepared by delammation of Laponite have been described elsewhere [16]. In Fig. 13, the delaminated 388 60 65 70 CONVERSION (V%FF) Fig. 13. Carbon generation clay improved carbon selectivity is attributed to its moderate acidity and macroporosity, which favors desorption of high molecular weight hydro- carbons which otherwise would be retained (occluded) as coke. Pillared clays' ease of deactivation from high carbonaceous deposits is attributed to their Lewis acidity and microporosity [17]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of a carbenium ion and initiation of the catalytic cracking process; a summary has been provided by Venuto and Habib [18]. Carbenium ion formation (over Bronsted sites) by proton addition to olefins (generated from thermal cracking) or via hydride abstraction from a paraffin by a Lewis acid site have been cited frequently as a reasonable possibility (vide supra). At the high (500 - 540 C) temperatures at which fluid cracking catalysts operate, mate- rials with open microporosity and high Lewis acidity (like pillared bentonites and hectorites) could interact with an olefin and form a stable ir-complex. Transfer of ff-electrons to empty metal orbitals forms a o-complex which imparts a positive charge to the olefin [19]. In the case of a clay pillared with AlaOa clusters: > ^Al + C^n > ^Al-CnHzn. The carbenium ions formed undergo the basic reactions of the cracking process discussed by Venuto and Habib [18]. Under actual cracking conditions, the interconver- sion of Bronsted to Lewis acid sites may not be as extensive because of water impurities in the feed and reactor conditions; therefore Bronsted sites cannot be excluded from participation in the cracking process over pillared clays. Polymerization and condensation reactions on these Lewis centers are believed to form and retain polyalkyi aromatics which generate high car- 389 bonaceous deposits [17]. In the conversion range of interest (70 - 80%) to refiners, these clay catalysts generate two to three times as much coke as zeolite-containing FCC. Therefore, carbon selectivity (and hydrofhermal stability) will have to be improved for pillared clays to compete with com- mercially available cracking catalysts; the value of the worldwide consump- tion of FCC now exceeds 400 million dollars.

        "dc:description": "Clay catalysts have been prepared using reagents different from the aluminum chlorhydrate solution usually employed to pillar smectite minerals. Colloidal alumina, alumina-coated silica and solutions containing chlorhydrated complexes of zirconium and aluminum produced pillared bentonites which, upon calcination at 400 °C, formed microporous two-dimensional structures with 200 – 500 m2 g−1 Langmuir surface area and basal spacing between 17 and 18 Å. These pillared clays contain both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites; above 300 °C, pyridine is retained predominantly on Lewis centers. The presence of zirconia seems to enhance Brönsted acidity, whereas pillaring with colloidal alumina particles increases the catalyst Lewis acidity. Cracking activity for gas oil conversion depends mainly on the surface area generated by pillaring. Pillared bentonites are more active but less selective than similarly prepared pillared hectorite catalysts.",
