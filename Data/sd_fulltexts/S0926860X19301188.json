Graphical abstract The catalyst active sites produce PP, whose properties - melt flow index (MFI) and molecular-weight distribution (as Mw/Mn) - depend on internal donors (ID) in the same manner for both methods of catalyst synthesis. Hence, the effect of ID on the catalyst active sites is not related with the effect of ID on the formation of MgCl2 crystallites with different cuts. Propylene polymerization catalysts with different internal donors (ID) are synthesized by two methods: (1) a standard method with ID introduction during formation of MgCl2 by reacting Mg(OEt)2 with TiCl4, and (2) the introduction of ID on MgCl2 already formed in the presence of butyl acetate (the substitution method). 1,3-diether, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and pentane-2,4-diol-dibenzoate (PDDB) are used as ID. Catalysts prepared with the same ID by both methods slightly differ in their composition, activity and stereospecificity (the content of xylene soluble polypropylene (PP) fraction). But the catalyst active sites produce PP, whose properties (melt flow index, MFI, and molecular-weight distribution as Mw/Mn) depend on ID in the same manner for both methods of catalyst synthesis. Hence, the effect of ID on the catalyst active sites is not related with the effect of ID on the formation of MgCl2 crystallites with different cuts. Keywords Ziegler-Natta catalysts Electron donor Internal donor substitution Polymer molecular properties 1 Introduction Nearly all polypropylene (PP) in the world is produced using supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts [1,2]. They consist of titanium tetrachloride and a stereoregulating electron donor compound (internal donor, ID) on the surface of MgCl2 crystallites used as the support. In propylene polymerization, these Ti-Mg catalysts (TMCs) are used in a combination with an organoaluminum cocatalyst (usually AlEt3) and other stereoregulating donor (external donor, ED). The use of donors allows controlling the molecular structure (stereoregularity, molecular weight, molecular-weight distribution) of the produced polymer [1–4]. Phthalates as ID and alkoxysilanes as ED have been developed [5] and still dominate in the world PP production. Compared to phthalates, 1,3-diethers made it possible to obtain high PP isotacticity in the absence of ED [6]. Catalysts with 1,3-diethers are more sensitive to hydrogen and produce PP with a narrower molecular-weight distribution (MWD) due to its more pronounced tendency to the secondary insertion of propylene [7,8]. Along with 1,3-diethers, the internal donors (2,3-substituted succinates [9,10] and “diol” donors [11,12]) were also found to produce PP with a broader MWD than in the case of phthalates. Another important role of ID is its participation in the formation of MgCl2 crystallites during the catalyst synthesis by reacting magnesium compounds (in particular, magnesium alkoxides or alkoxychlorides, adducts of magnesium dichloride with alcohols or other donors) with titanium tetrachloride. In particular, the interaction of magnesium ethoxide with titanium tetrachloride in the absence of phthalate leads to a solid product comprising magnesium chloride with a high content of titanium and ethoxy groups corresponding to TiCl3OEt as intermediate product [13,14]. TiCl3OEt seems to be present as molecular complexes with MgCl2 and is removed under the action of phthalate. Thus, ID facilitates both the occurrence and completion of the formation of MgCl2 crystallites. In the study by Andoni et al. [15], the role of internal donors in the catalyst synthesis from solutions of MgCl2·nEtOH complexes was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the crystallite shapes of MgCl2·nEtOH complexes formed over silicon wafer depend on the type of donor introduced in the solutions. The introduction of 1,3-diether results in the formation of crystallites that have only the 120° angles between cuts, whereas in the case of ethylbenzoate or diisobutyl phthalate, both 120 and 90° angles are observed; it means that in the latter case two types of cuts (110 and 104) are obtained, while in the first case, one type of cuts. Since MWD of PP in the case of 1,3-diether is narrower than in the case of ethylbenzoate or phthalate, the authors supposed that the role of ID consists in the formation of MgCl2 crystallites with different cuts, in particular, one type of cuts when 1,3-diether is involved in the process, and two types of cuts in the case of mono-or diesters. This gives a broader distribution of active sites in the latter case and, respectively, a broader MWD of the polymer. The aim of our study is to verify that the effect of ID on PP properties (MWD, melt flow index, etc.) is due to the formation of MgCl2 crystallites with different cuts (different ratios of 110 and 104 cuts). For this purpose, catalysts with the same ID were synthesized by two methods. In the first case, a standard method was used when Mg(OEt)2 interacted with TiCl4 in the presence of ID, and this donor was involved in the formation of MgCl2 crystallites. According to the second method, ID was introduced on the already formed MgCl2 crystallites, which were preliminarily obtained by reacting Mg(OEt)2 with TiCl4 in the presence of butyl acetate (BA). In this case, ID replaces butyl acetate on the surface of the formed MgCl2 crystallites (the substitution method). The possibility of the substitution of ethylbenzoate by dibutyl phthalate, in particular, was demonstrated in our earlier study [16]. As ID we used the above mentioned 1,3-diether (a narrow MWD of PP and a high sensitivity to hydrogen) and phthalate (a moderate MWD of the polymer and a moderate sensitivity to hydrogen), and additionally pentane-2,4-diol-dibenzoate (PDDB) [11,12], which provides a broad MWD of PP and a decreased sensitivity to hydrogen. Overall, the catalysts with different IDs, providing different MWD of PP and sensitivity to hydrogen, were investigated. If ID affects PP properties via the formation of MgCl2 crystallites with different cut ratios, it can be expected that the dependence of PP properties on ID type will differ for catalysts synthesized by two methods: when MgCl2 crystallites are formed in the presence of ID or when ID is introduced by substitution on the already formed MgCl2 crystallites. In particular, according to [15], the catalyst prepared with BA as monoester must have both types of lateral MgCl2 cuts, 110 and 104. Then the catalyst where BA was substituted by 1,3-diether will have active sites on both cuts 110 and 104 compared to the standard catalyst with 1,3-diether, in which there are active sites on one cut. As a result, a wider distribution of active sites for the substituted catalyst should be observed, and PP with other properties can be produced. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Heptane, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and chlorobenzene were kept over molecular sieves. Commercial TiCl4, propylene, triethylaluminum, magnesium ethoxide (Aldrich, 0.5 mm), 9,9-bis-methoxymethyl-9H-fluorene (1,3-diether), and pentane-2,4-diol-dibenzoate were used without additional purification. 2.2 Catalyst synthesis Catalysts with each stereoregulating internal donor were synthesized by two methods. According to the first method, the catalyst was synthesized via the interaction of magnesium ethoxide with TiCl4 in the presence of chlorobenzene (CB). The synthesis was carried out in three steps in an argon atmosphere. In the first step, TiCl4, CB and Mg(OEt)2 (TiCl4/Mg =13 mol, TiCl4/CB = 1:1 vol.) were loaded into reactor. After that, the reaction medium was heated to 110 °C under stirring, a stereoregulating donor (ID/Mg = 0.15) was introduced, and the medium was held at 110 °C for an hour. After stopping the stirrer and precipitation of the solid product, the mother liquor was decanted. In the second step, the same amount of the mixture of TiCl4 and CB (1:1 vol., TiCl4/Mg =13 mol) was loaded in the reactor, and the reaction medium was stirred at 110 °C for 30 min; after precipitation of the solid product, the mother liquor was decanted. The third step was performed similar to the second one. The synthesized catalysts were washed four times with heptane at a gradual cooling from 75 °C to room temperature. According to the second method, the catalyst was synthesized with butyl acetate (BA/Mg =0.2 mol) instead of ID by the method described above. After that, the same method was used to obtain the catalyst, but instead of Mg(OEt)2, TMC was loaded with butyl acetate, and a stereoregulating donor was introduced in the first and second steps (ID/Mg =0.05 mol in each step). 2.3 Chemical analysis The content of Ti and Mg was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Optima 4300 DV, Perkin-Elmer) using the catalyst solution in a 5% aqueous solution of H2SO4. The content of ethoxy groups (as ethanol) and nonaromatic donors was measured by gas chromatography (NetChrom v. 2.0) using the catalyst solution in methyl cellosolve. Decyl alcohol served as the internal standard. The content of aromatic donors was found by liquid chromatography (LC-20 Prominence, Shimadzu) using the catalyst solution in acetonitrile. Dimethyl phthalate served as the internal standard. 2.4 Pore structure Pore structure was analyzed by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption on an ASAP 2400 Micrоmeritics instrument. Specific surface area (SBET, m2/g) and total pore volume (Vpore, cm3/g) were measured, and average pore size (dpore) was calculated by the equation dpore = 4 Vpore/SBET. Pore size distribution was calculated by the BJH method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. 2.5 X-ray diffraction study The XRD study of TMCs was performed on a diffractometer using a Cu Kα source (λ =1.54184 Å) in the 2Θ range from 5 to 75°. Catalyst samples were placed in cuvettes and sealed to prevent contact with the atmosphere in a dry box. The size of MgCl2 crystallites along the 110 direction was calculated by the Scherrer formula for the peak at 2Θ = 50°. 2.6 Propylene polymerization Propylene polymerization was performed in an autoclave in heptane (300 ml) at a temperature of 70 °C and total pressure 7 bar for 1 h in the presence of hydrogen (1 vol.% in the gas phase). Triethylaluminum (4 mmol Al/L) was used as a cocatalyst, and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxysilane (Al/CHMDMS =20 mol.) served as the external donor. A weight of the catalyst sample was ca. 10 mg. Prepolymerization was carried out at 30 °C and propylene pressure of 1 bar for 2 min. 2.7 XS, MFI and MWD measurements The xylene-soluble PP fraction with a low stereoregularity (XS values) was estimated according to ASTM D5492. The melt flow index (MFI) of PP was determined in compliance with ASTM D1238. MWD of the polymers (Mw/Mn values) was measured by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (PL 220C with a set of 13 μm PLgel Olexis columns) at 160 °C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as a solvent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The instrument was calibrated using polyethylene and polystyrene standards with narrow MWD. 3 Results and discussion TMCs with different IDs were synthesized by two methods: 1) the standard method, where ID is introduced at the beginning of the synthesis and is present during the formation of MgCl2 crystallites; 2) the introduction of ID by substitution of butyl acetate on the already formed MgCl2 crystallites. Data on the composition and properties of catalysts synthesized by each method are presented and compared below. 3.1 Catalysts synthesized by the standard method 3.1.1 Catalyst composition Table 1 shows data on the composition of TMCs synthesized using different internal donors by the standard method. The catalyst with dibutyl phthalate contains 3.3% of titanium, 18% of magnesium and 11.5% of a donor. The catalysts with non-phthalate donors, which have a narrower or broader MWD of the polymer, contain a greater amount of titanium (4.6%) and a smaller amount of magnesium (13.7–14.5 %). All catalysts have a content of donors in the range of 11.5–13.0 %. The interaction of magnesium ethoxide with titanium tetrachloride proceeds via the formation of the intermediate product TiCl3OEt. The TiCl3OEt content in TMC can be found from the content of ethoxy groups. Some catalysts were analyzed for the content of ethoxy groups, which gave low values, below 0.2%. Assuming that titanium and magnesium are present in the catalysts as chlorides, one can estimate the total content of MgCl2, TiCl4 and ID. It ranges from 85 to 95% for different TMCs, which is quite close to 100%. The molar ratio Ti/Mg is equal to 0.16 – 0.17 for non-phthalate TMCs, and 0.09 for the phthalate catalyst. The ID/Mg molar ratio is ca. 0.06 in the case of TMCs with DBP and PDDB, and ca. 0.09 for TMC with 1,3-diether. According to these data, the Ti/ID molar ratio is 1.7–1.9 for TMCs with 1,3-diether and dibutyl phthalate, and 2.6 for TMC with the diol donor. Supposedly, in the first case there are two TiCl4 molecules per one donor molecule, which may correspond to the alternation of dimeric TiCl4 complexes and ID. 3.1.2 Catalyst performance in propylene polymerization Results of propylene polymerization with the catalysts indicated above are listed in Table 2 . The highest activity was observed for the catalysts with 1,3-diether and DBP, 13.3 and 14 kg PP/g cat h, respectively. TMCs with the diol donor had a lower activity, 8.3 kg PP/g cat h. Dependences of polymerization rate on time are presented in Fig. 1 . The XS values for TMCs with DBP and 1,3-diether are equal to 2.3 and 3.1%, respectively, and are slightly higher (3.6%) for the catalyst with PDDB. Accordingly, isotacticity of PP (as 100 – XS) is equal to 97.7 and 96.9% in the first case and 96.4% for TMC with PDDB. Table 2 shows also the data on MFI and Mw/Mn of PP, which characterize the catalyst sensitivity to hydrogen for controlling the polymer chain length, and the molecular-weight distribution of PP, respectively. MFI values decrease fourfold (from 17.6 to 4.5 g/10 min) in the following order of internal donors: 1,3-diether > DBP > PDDB. Mw/Mn values increase from 3.5 to 5.3 in the same order of donors. 3.2 Catalysts synthesized by substitution of butyl acetate 3.2.1 Catalyst composition Data on the composition of substituted catalysts and initial catalyst with butyl acetate are listed in Table 3 . The catalyst with butyl acetate, which was used to synthesize the substituted catalysts, contains 4.6% of titanium, 17.8% of magnesium, 4.6% of butyl acetate, 2.2% of ethyl acetate, and 1.1% of ethoxy groups. Ethyl acetate (EA) seems to form in situ by exchanging BA with Ti-OEt groups that are present during the catalyst synthesis. The substituted catalysts contain 16.6–18.6 % of magnesium, which is close to the magnesium amount in TMC with BA. In comparison with the initial TMC with butyl acetate, the substituted catalysts contain a smaller titanium amount (2.8–3.6 %), especially the TMCs with 1,3-diether and DBP (2.8% of titanium). The weight fraction of donors for different TMCs constitutes 8–10.2 %. The content of butyl acetate in the substituted catalysts is 0.16% in the case of 1,3-diether and PDDB, and 0.3% in the case of DBP. This testifies to a virtually complete substitution of butyl acetate by internal donor under the studied conditions. These data for each TMC can be used to estimate the total content of magnesium and titanium chlorides and donor. It is equal to 86–95 %, which is quite close to 100%. The Ti/Mg molar ratio is equal to 0.076 – 0.106 for the catalysts with different IDs. The ID/Mg molar ratio varies from 0.058 to 0.036 in the order of IDs from 1,3-diether to PDDB. The total content of donors in the butyl acetate catalyst is 6.8%, but due to a lower molecular weight of butyl acetate and ethyl acetate, the ID/Mg ratio is greater and equal to 0.088. The Ti/ID molar ratio ranges from 1.5 to 1.6 for TMCs with BA, 1,3-diether and DBP, and is equal to 2.9 for the catalyst with the diol donor. The Ti/ID values characterizing the distribution of titanium chloride and donor on the magnesium chloride surface are close to similar values for the corresponding catalysts synthesized by the standard method. 3.2.2 Catalyst performance in propylene polymerization The results of propylene polymerization on TMCs synthesized by substitution of butyl acetate are listed in Table 4 and kinetic curves are presented in Fig. 2 . The average activity of the initial catalyst with butyl acetate is quite low (7.3 kg PP/g cat h). Note that its initial activity is high (ca. 17 kg PP/g cat h), but sharply drops (by a factor of 3.5) during polymerization (Fig. 2). PP produced contains a substantial amount of low-stereoregular fraction (XS = 9.6%). The activity of substituted catalysts ranges from 10.6 to 12.2 kg PP/g cat h and is more stable with polymerization time compared to that of the initial catalyst with butyl acetate (Fig. 2). Stereospecificity of substituted TMCs is high: their XS value is equal to 2.2–2.9 %, and PP isotacticity is 97.1–97.8 %. PP properties (MFI and Mw/Mn values) for the catalysts synthesized by substitution of butyl acetate strongly depend on ID. In particular, MFI values decrease from 16.2 to 3.5 g/10 min in the following order of internal donors: BA ˜ 1,3-diether > DBP > PDDB. Mw/Mn values increase from 4.5 to 6.2 in the same order of donors. 3.2.3 Initial versus substituted catalysts Two catalysts prepared with BA (initial TMC) and then substituted by 1,3-diether are studied to reveal the effect of the donor substitution method on the catalyst structure. Data obtained are listed in Table 5 . Catalysts have close specific surface areas: 332 and 304 m2/g for initial and substituted catalysts, respectively. Their specific pore volume and average pore size remain practically constant upon donor substitution: 0.30 cm3/g vs 0.29 cm3/g, and 3.7 nm vs 3.8 nm. Hence, the method of donor substitution under the studied conditions does not influence the catalyst pore structure. According to XRD (Fig. 3 ), the sizes of MgCl2 crystallites along the 110 direction are also close: 5.4 and 5.7 nm for the initial and substituted catalysts, respectively. So, we consider that lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites do not change during donor substitution under the studied conditions. Earlier [17] we have studied the interaction of donors with highly dispersed MgCl2 (ca. 100 m2/g, d(110) =13 nm, d(001) =6 nm) under similar conditions (110оC, chlorobenzene as a solvent) at the molar ratio ID/Mg from 0.01 to 0.3 and revealed that the content of a donor (ethylbenzoate, diisobutyl phthalate) in the sample increases in the range of ID/Mg = 0.01−0.03 and then remains constant. This corresponds to the formation of surface complexes of a donor on MgCl2 (adsorption of a donor on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites). Under different conditions (30оC, heptane), the content of a donor in the sample is higher, which is related with the additional formation of molecular complexes of a donor and MgCl2 (see also Ref. [18]). So, the data obtained show that the donor substitution method results in complete transformation of the initial catalyst to new ones. In particular, compared to the initial TMC, the substituted catalysts have a high ID content and almost a full absence of butyl acetate, a high and stable with time activity and a high stereospecificity (high PP isotacticity and low XS values). PP properties (MFI and Mw/Mn values) also differ considerably from those for butyl acetate catalyst and are determined by ID type. 3.3 Comparison of the performance of TMCs prepared by two methods 3.3.1 Catalyst composition Ti/Mg and ID/Mg molar ratios for the catalysts synthesized with each ID by two methods are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The catalyst composition differs noticeably in dependence on the synthesis method. Substituted compared to standard TMCs with the same ID have a lower Ti/Mg value. In the case of 1,3-diether and PDDB, the Ti/Mg molar ratio is 0.09 – 0.11 for substituted catalysts, and 0.16 – 0.17 for standard TMCs. In the case of DBP, the Ti/Mg molar ratio depends on the synthesis method to a smaller extent: 0.076 versus 0.093, respectively. Since the content of ethoxy groups in catalysts is low, the increased Ti/Mg value cannot be caused by the presence of intermediate products such as titanium ethoxychlorides. In comparison with the corresponding standard TMCs, the ID/Mg molar ratio in substituted catalysts is noticeably lower in the case of 1,3-diether and PDDB and slightly lower in the case of DBP. The higher Ti/Mg and ID/Mg values for standard catalysts could be attributed to a partial presence of inactive TiCl4*ID complexes. However, it would give the lower Ti/ID values for standard TMCs in comparison with substituted catalysts, but that does not agree with experimental data (Tables 1 and 3). Another possible explanation is related to a larger fraction of magnesium ions with chlorine vacancies on lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites (due to their smaller size) in standard catalysts as compared to substituted (via BA) catalysts. This would lead to a higher (in proportion to titanium content) activity of standard catalysts. However, it does not agree with the data obtained: the activity of substituted catalysts is only slightly (ca. 20%) less than that of respective standard catalysts, and in the case of PDDB it is even higher (see below). Perhaps, in standard syntheses compared to substituted ones, the formation of MgCl2 by reacting Mg(OEt)2 with TiCl4 and ID proceeds with a high yield of various intermediate products and complexes from compounds containing magnesium, titanium and donor. A part of such compounds may be occluded during the solid-phase conversion of Mg(OEt)2 to MgCl2, thus increasing the Ti/Mg and ID/Mg ratios in standard catalysts compared to substituted TMCs. 3.3.2 Catalyst performance in propylene polymerization A comparison of the activity and XS values for catalysts synthesized with each ID by two methods is given in Fig. 5 . The catalysts with 1,3-diether or DBP have comparable activities for both methods of catalyst synthesis. The substituted catalyst with PDDB is more active than the respective standard TMC. XS values in polymers obtained with substituted TMCs are close (1,3-diether and DBP) or lower (PDDB) than XS values for the respective standard catalysts. Note the substituted catalyst BA + 1,3-diether tested without an external donor has high activity (13 kg PP/g cat h) and high stereospecificity (100 – XS = 96.6%) similar to that for the corresponding standard catalyst with 1,3-diether (15.5 kg PP/g cat h and 100 – XS = 95.7%). Fig. 6 shows the effect of ID on the properties of polymers (MFI and Mw/Mn values) for catalysts synthesized by two methods. It is seen that the melt flow index of PP changes with ID in a similar manner irrespective of the catalyst synthesis method: from 17.6 to 4.5 g/10 min for the standard method, and from 15.5 to 3.5 g/10 min for the substitution method. The molecular-weight distribution of PP also depends on the internal donor: the Mw/Mn values increase in the order 1,3-diether – phthalate – PDDB in a similar way for both methods of catalyst synthesis. Thus, PP properties depend on ID and weakly depend on the catalyst synthesis method. Overall, a comparison of catalysts synthesized by two methods with the same ID demonstrates that PP properties depend on ID similarly in both cases, when the donor is present in the reaction mixture during MgCl2 formation or is introduced (by substitution of BA) on the preliminarily formed MgCl2. Thus, the effect of ID on active sites of TMC is not related to its effect on the formation of different cuts of MgCl2 crystallites and seems be related to the distribution of ID and TiCl4 on these cuts. 4 Conclusion 1 PP catalysts with different IDs are prepared by two methods: (1) a standard method with ID introduction during the formation of MgCl2, and (2) the introduction of ID on MgCl2 already formed in the presence of butyl acetate (the substitution method). 2 Catalysts prepared with the same ID by both methods slightly differ in their composition, activity and stereospecificity (as 100 – XS value). PP properties (melt flow index and Mw/Mn) depend on ID in the same manner for both methods, when the donor is present in the reaction mixture during MgCl2 formation or is introduced (by substitution of BA) on the preliminarily formed MgCl2. 3 The effect of ID on the catalyst active sites is not related to its effect on the formation of different cuts of MgCl2 crystallites and seems be related to the distribution of ID and TiCl4 on these cuts.
