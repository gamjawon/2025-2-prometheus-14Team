Getty, Steven C. Petrosius and Russell S. Drago University of Florida, Department of Chemistry, Gainesville, FL 32611 (US.A.) (Received August 27, 1990; accepted November 16, 1990) Abstract A series of novel, solid strong acids has been prepared by treatment of inorganic oxides with Lewis acids and metal chlorides. The objective is to create four-coordinate, as opposed to the usual six-coordinate, aluminum centers on inorganic oxides which should result in strong acid catalysts. Several novel metal-doped solid acid catalysts combine this strong acidity with metal dopant reactivities to attain the selectivity of non-radical pathways. These new solid acid catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity for the dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination of various polychlorinated molecules. Introduction Recently the authors have reported the preparation of a strong solid acid catalyst by refluxing A12C18 with inorganic oxides in CC14 [1-3]. The resulting material, (SG)nAlC12 where SG refers to silica gel and n = 4, contains tetrahedral aluminum centers which are very strong Lewis acids [3]. These materials were shown to exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for acidcatalyzed cracking of hydrocarbons under mild conditions in which present commercial catalysts do not react. However, in order to sustain activity, a chlorine source, e.g. HCl or CC14, was required. When CC14 was used as a chlorine source, CHC13 and CH2Cl2 were observed as reaction products. This indicates that the CC14, used to regenerate the strong acid sites, is involved in a hydrodechlorination reaction. In an attempt to extend our study of the reactivity of this material in new systems, we decided to investigate acid-catalyzed hydrodechlorination and dehydrochlorination reactions [4-9]. In these systems the substrate would also serve to maintain catalytic activity, as it possesses chlorine. There is considerable interest in the chemical transformations of organochlorine compounds for hazardous waste management because of the need to change the product mix of existing processes and to produce degradable replacement materials for organochlorine compounds and freons [ 10, 11 ]. The dehydrochlorination process involves the selective removal of HCl from a molecule. The reaction of 1,2-dichloroethane to form vinyl chloride and HCl is an example of this reaction. At present, vinyl chloride is produced 0304-5102/91/$3.50 O Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 128 commercially by the thermal dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane, and catalysis is not involved [ 11 ]. The hydrodechlorination process is the selective replacement of a chlorine atom by a hydrogen atom, e.g. the conversion of carbon tetrachloride to chloroform. This reaction is used mainly for the decomposition of hazardous or unwanted organochlorine compounds [5, 6, 8, 9, 12], and has potential use for changing the product mix from the chlorination of methane. Recent attention to the negative environmental impact of CC14-based freons illustrates the importance of using CHC13-based freons as less environmentally damaging alternatives [ 10 ]. Catalysts for dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination [4-9, 12-14] range from Group VIII metals on solid supports to homogeneous organometallic complexes. Most reactions involve a radical mechanism leading to poor selectivity with the formation of high molecular weight polychlorinated hydrocarbons. As with hydrocarbon cracking catalysts, the reported catalysts are active for only a very short time [5-9]. In this study, our new solid acid catalyst, which has been previously reported for the cracking of hydrocarbons, is doped with metals and used for both the dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination of various polychlorinated molecules [1, 2]. Carbon tetrachloride was chosen as one of the model compounds for the hydrodechlorination reactions, because much work has already been performed on this reactant. The model compound 1,2-dichloroethane was chosen for the dehydrochlorination reactions. Conversion of this substrate to vinyl chloride is the largest commercial dehydrochlorination reaction. In this study we report that our strong acid catalyst doped with Group VIII metals results in effective catalysts for dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination reactions. Experimental section Materials All metal halides were used as purchased unless otherwise stated. The palladium(II) chloride (PdC12), dipotassium tetrachloropalladate (K2PdCl4), ruthenium(III) chloride (RuC13), copper(II) chloride (CUCl2), cobalt(II) chloride (COC12 - 6H20) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhC13) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Aluminum chloride (Al2C16) was purchased from Alfa Products with a purity of 99.997%. ZnC12 was purchased from Fisher Scientific. All solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific except tetrachloroethylene, which was purchased from Eastman Kodak. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and methylene chloride were dried over phosphorus(V) oxide (Fisher). Chloroform (containing ethanol as a stabilizer) was purified by passage through an activated alumina column. Tetrachloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and npentane were used as purchased. All solvents were stored over 4 A molecular sieves (Davison). Semiconductor-grade hydrogen chloride (99.995%) was purchased from Air Products. The support used for the preparation of the catalysts was silicon dioxide (Si02) and was used as purchased unless otherwise 129 stated. The primary material was Davison Grade #62 silicon dioxide (donated by W. R. Grace Co.) with a surface area of 340 m2 g-', pore volume of 1.1 cm' g-' and a mesh size of 60-200 [ 15 ]. Catalyst preparation anal catalytic studies In a 200 ml 3-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar was placed 10.0 g of a 2% metal chloride on silica gel, 5.0 g aluminum chloride and 150 ml carbon tetrachloride (dried over 4 A sieves). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at reflux under a N2 atmosphere for a minimum of 24 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered under an N2 atmosphere. The filtrate was colorless and the resulting solid product obtained was orange in color. The catalyst is watersensitive and turns light orange on exposure to moisture. The 2% metal chloride on silica gel was prepared as follows. In a 200 ml 3-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a Tefloncoated magnetic stir bar was placed 10.0 g silica gel (washed with 1 M HCl and dried under vacuum at 80 C for 72 h), 0.2 g metal chloride and 100 ml carbon tetrachloride (dried over 4 A sieves). The reaction mixture was stirred and heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h. The ZnC12treated catalysts were prepared by the addition of an amount of ZnC12 (equivalent to three times the molar amount of metal chloride present) to the 2% metal chloride-silica gel mixture. After refluxing for 20-24 h the resulting mixture was reacted with A12C16 as described above. In the case of RhC13'(SG),MC12, the RhC13'(SG),, solid was isolated prior to AIC13 addition. The mixed PdC12 - RhC13 * (SG) AIC12 catalyst was prepared by refluxing PdC12 and Si02 in CC14 for 2 h, followed by addition of RhC13 and refluxing another 2-3 h and finally reaction of that mixture with AIC13 for 8-10 h. For the K2PdC14 . RhC13 - (SG),AIC12 and ZnC12-RhCI3-(SG)nMC12 catalysts, the order of reaction was RhC13 and silica in CC14, addition of the other transition metal salt and finally aluminum chloride. ZnC12 - RuC13 ' (SG),AIC12 was prepared in a similar manner with RuC13, ZnC12 and AIC13 addition in that order. Catalytic studies were conducted in the fixed-bed flow reactor system previously described [2] using - 1.0 g of catalyst with a system pressure of 10-14 psi. This reactor was further modified using a syringe pump to deliver liquid reactants to the catalyst in place of a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon/carbon tetrachloride bubbler. A preheater zone was added to the system to ensure proper mixing and heating of all reactants before they were contacted with the catalyst. Typically only one gas (hydrogen) was used as a carrier gas and/or reactant gas. The gas flow rate was regulated by a calibrated rotoflow meter purchased from Gilmont Instruments. Instrumentation All air- and water-sensitive manipulations were performed in a Vacuum Atmosphere Co. model HE-43-2 inert atmosphere box or in an Aldrich inert atmosphere glove bag. All syntheses were conducted under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere and 1 atm pressure. Routine GC analysis for chlorinated 130 hydrocarbons was performed on a model 3700 TCD Varian gas chromatograph equipped with a 1 /8 inch x 8 foot Porapak Q (100-120 mesh) column. The GC FTIR was performed on a Nicolet 5DXB FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Nicolet GC interface and a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph using a 1.5 p, thick DB 130 m fused silica capillary column that was 30 m in length. Products were analyzed and confirmed by GC/MS. Gas samples were analyzed on a AEI MS 30 mass spectrometer with a Koitos DS55 data station. The system was connected to a Pye Unicam 104 gas chromatograph equipped with a 1 /4 inch X 5 foot glass Porapak Q (100-120 mesh) column. Infrared spectra were obtained as mulls on a Nicolet 5DXB FT-IR spectrometer using KBr plates. All solid-liquid phase cracking reactions and polymerizations were carried out in 250 ml or 500 ml Parr pressure bottles equipped with a brass or stainless steel Swagelok pressure heads and neoprene stoppers. Results and discussion Hydroaechlorination catalysts The first catalyst studied, a palladium(II)-doped acid catalyst, was synthesized with the aim of preparing a catalytic hydrodechlorination catalyst with strong acid centers that would lead to the selectivity expected for nonradical paths. Palladium was chosen as the dopant because it is known that palladium will activate dihydrogen. The metal hydride or bound hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface would be readily available to quench the carbonium ion or carbonium ion-like species generated by the abstraction of a Cl- ion from carbon tetrachloride. The catalytic reactions were conducted in a heterogeneous glass flow reactor as described in the Experimental section. A hydrogen gas feed saturated with carbon tetrachloride vapors was passed over the catalyst at 90 C and atmospheric pressure. Table 1 gives a summary of the product distribution for the reaction of HZ and CC14 catalyzed by Pd(SG),MC12 at 90 C and shows that the catalyst produces chloroform with high selectivity. As with the undoped (SG) AIC12 catalyst, when the catalyst is exposed to moisture it is deactivated, producing only trace quantities of TABLE 1 Product distribution for Pd\"/(SG) AIC12 catalyst at 90 C with HZ and- CCl4 Product 4b' unknown 0.02 methane 0.25 phosgene 0.19 HCI 0.18 methyl chloride 0.07 chloroform 99.29 `Based on integrated area units. 131 chloroform at 50 to 90 C and only trace amounts of C,-C4 hydrocarbons at 120 to 150 C. This indicates that the strong acid sites on the support are playing a role in the formation of chloroform. Appropriate blank reactions were carried out. The first involved use of the undoped strong acid catalyst, (SG),,AIC1z, with a HZ and CC14 feed at 90 C. Traces of only two products were detected and no chloroform was observed even at 140 C. When Pdt'/ (SG),, (prepared without aluminum chloride) was used, no products were observed even at 225 C. The use of 3% palladium-on-charcoal resulted in an active system. Table 2 gives a summary of the product distribution for the reaction with HZ and CC14 at 90 C. A wide variety of products are formed in this reaction. The C,-C5 hydrocarbons arise from the hydrogenation of the carbonaceous coke deposits and/or charcoal support. A second method was used to prepare the palladium(II)-doped acid catalyst. The first method, preparation 1, involved treating PdC12-doped silica gel with aluminum chloride in refluxing carbon tetrachloride. The second method of preparation involves taking a premade batch of A12C18-treated silica gel (SG)nAIC12 and doping the catalyst with PdC12. We shall call this Type II and label it (SG)n,AIC1z . PdC12. The types of products observed from the catalyzed reaction of HZ with carbon tetrachloride are very different for the two different preparations. Typical reaction conditions involved placing - 1 g of the Pd(II)-doped catalysts in a glass flow reactor system over which hydrogen gas saturated with carbon tetrachloride at various temperatures is passed. Vastly different reactivity is observed for Type II. For the first few hours only methane is produced. After 4.5 h ethane and propane appear as products, with isobutane forming after 5 h. Large amounts of C1-C4 products are produced during the first 18 h of operation; however, no chloroform is observed in the product stream. After 18 h reaction, chloroform was observed in the product stream in small amounts. No significant increase in chloroform formation is obtained as the temperature is raised to 110 C. At 110 C the catalyst deactivates. When the experiment was repeated at 50 C using - 1 g (SG)YAIC12 - PdC12 (Type II) catalyst, small amounts of methane and ethane were detected in TABLE 2 Product distribution for a 3g'o palladium-on-charcoal catalyst at 90 C with HZ and CC14 Product 96a methane 12.2 ethane 13.3 propane 3.8 butane 1.1 pentane 1.1 chloroform 68.5 'Based on integrated area units. 132 30 min with trace amounts of propane and isobutane. No chloroform was observed at this time. The activity of the catalyst increased with time, reaching a stable level for CI-Cq hydrocarbon formation in 3 h. Chloroform formation increased to about 10.1 % of the products after 9 h. Hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride were passed over 3.2 g of a commercially available Pd-on-alumina catalyst at 100 C, producing C1-C5 hydrocarbons with methane as the predominant product. As the reaction temperature is raised to 175 C and 200 C, some chloroform and methylene chloride are detected as reaction products. Since the addition of PdC12 to (SG)nAIC12 could lead to PdC142- and PdC13- species in the Type II catalyst, K2PdC14 was used instead of PdCl2 to dope the catalyst by method I. The resulting catalyst was very active for the production of hydrocarbons (with methane by far the major product) but inactive for hydrodeehlorination. The product distributions and catalyst activities for the reaction of CC14 and HZ over (SG)nMC12 - PdCl2 (Type II), KRd(II)C14-doped (SG)nMCl2 (made by method I) and Pd-on-alumina at 100 C are shown in Fig. 1. These values correspond to a feed rate of 1.04 x 10-4 mol min-' of CC14. The product selectivity for each of the catalysts is similar, with differences observed in the activity. Iron(III) chloride and cobalt(II) chloride-doped acid catalyst prepared by method I were studied for the hydrodechlorination of carbon tetrachloride. The cobalt catalyst generated only small amounts of methane and the iron catalyst generated traces of hydrocarbons and small amounts of CHCl3. Both are considered inactive. The results of the above experiments provide insights into the reactivity and mechanism of hydrodehalogenation reactions.

Comparison of the product distributions for the reaction of HZ with CCI, over various palladium catalysts at 100 C. All of the observed C products are grouped under the n carbon number. - 133 undoped (SG),,AIC12 catalyst and those doped with iron and cobalt illustrate the need to activate 112- When H2 is activated by palladium in the absence of strong acid centers, the palladium center will totally hydrodechlorinate the carbon tetrachloride to methane and sub-hydrocarbon species which may oligomerize to form longer-chain hydrocarbon products via a Fisher-Tropsch type mechanism. These results are consistent with reports in the literature for palladium-based dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination catalysts [4-9, 16]. Methane and higher hydrocarbons are obtained for all palladium-doped catalysts except that prepared by method I. In the method I preparation, the exchange of PdC12 with SG leads to Pd 2+ bound to anionic silica surface oxygens. Some A12C16 can react with chloride that may not have been exchanged to form Pd(AIC14)2, but enough A12CI6 remains to react with the silica gel to form the strong acid sites of (SG),,AIC12. These react with CC14 to generate (SG),,AICl3'CC13+, a carbonium ion-like species that is proposed to form when A12Clg reacts with CC14 [17, 18]. The proximity of a Pd-H surface unit (or hydrogen spillover) results in nucleophilic attack on carbon, forming CHC13. Elimination of HCl regenerates the catalyst. Thus, the synergism between the acid center and the HZ activation center proposed as the objective for these experiments lead to the desired specificity. This conclusion is supported by the deactivation of our catalyst when exposed to moisture. Doping the catalyst with K2PdCl4 can be viewed as having an excess of chloride per mole of Pd present. The excess chloride deactivates the strong acid site by transferring chloride to it. One further piece of evidence can be offered for the non-radical nature of the reaction with the strong acid catalyst, and that is the absence of CZC18 in our product. Hexachloroethane is known as a `fingerprint' product of free-radical CC14 reactions [5, 9], arising from the coupling of CC13 radicals. Thus, the Type I Pd(SG) MC12doped strong acid catalyst is found to be an effective and selective catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of chlorocarbon substrates. Dehydrochlorination catalysis The substrate selected to study dehydrochlorination is 1,2-dichloroethane. Hydrodechlorination is also possible for this substrate leading to ethyl chloride while dehydrochlorination produces vinyl chloride. The relative amounts of these products can provide insight into the mechanism of the reaction and the role of the metal dopants. In the initial study, our strong acid catalyst was used for the dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures of 100 to 175 C. Little or no vinyl chloride was observed and extreme coking occurred. The main reaction involved conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane to 1,1-dichloroethane. At 175 C the conversion was 489% The reaction of 1,2-dichloroethane with the acid center probably forms a chloroethylcarbonium ion that loses a proton to form vinyl chloride and HCI. In the presence of the acid catalyst, Markownikov addition of HCl across the vinyl double bond is catalyzed to form 1,1-dichloroethane. 134 Metal dopants in this system should decrease the acidity of coordination sites for alkenes so the HCI Markownikov addition to vinyl chloride is not catalyzed. Dopants can also activate hydrogen to prevent coking. Various additives were studied and the results reported in Table 3. The results presented in this Table as well as those in Fig. 2 are based on a feed rate of 1.26 X 10' mol min-' of dichloroethane. PdC12 and RhC13 (Method 1) activate HZ and minimize coking but, as is seen in Table 3, these materials completely hydrodehalogenate 1,2-dichloroethane, leading to ethane as the major product. Ethane can result via two hydrodehalogenation steps. A dehydrohalogenation followed by a hydrogenation and then either a repeat of these steps or a hydrodehalogenation of ethyl chloride can also lead to ethane. Since PdC142- was found to be effective in neutralizing acid sites in TABLE 3 Hydrodechlorination and dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane Temperature Catalyst ( C) Product (mol min'') Ethane Ethyl chloride Vinyl chloride 150 PdClz - (SG)nAAlC12 1.7 x 10-5 1.5 X 10-a 5.0 x 10-7 125 RhC13 ' (SG),tMC12 2.4 x 10-5 5.0 X 10-' - 150 RUC13'(SG),AIC12 6.0 x 10-' 5.0 X 10-7 2.6 x 10-e 125 X2PdC14 - (SG) AIC12 1.0 x 10-e - - 150 PdC12 - RhC13 - (SG) AICl2 2.0 x 10-6 3.5 X 10-o 1.6 x 10-e 150 KZPdC14 - RliC13 ' (SG) AIC12 2.5 x 10-a 1.2 x 10-e - 150 ZrIC12 - RhC13 - (SG),AIC12 8.8 x 10-a 1.3 x 10-a 2.1 x 10-o 125 ZnC12 - RuC13 - (SG) AICIz 1.2 x 10-5 5.9 x 10-a 3.3 x 10-e 2.400- _z _ 1.600U p o ~ 12nn-~ a E_ O t 0.8001 0.400- 0.000 C2H6 C3H8 C2H3CI C2H4 C4H10 C2H5C1 PRODUCT Rh/Zn Pd Ru Fig. 2.

This led to a catalyst with only moderate activity that completely hydrodehalogenated the substrate. The rhodium dopant is most effective at total hydrodehalogenation, while palladium leads to significant amounts of ethyl chloride and some vinyl chloride. The ruthenium dopant leads to the dehydrohalogenation product, vinyl chloride, as the major product of the reaction of 1,2-dichloroethane with about 70% selectivity at 36% conversion. The catalyst shows excellent resistance to coking and good stability to 200 C. The results of the high temperature studies are summarized in Fig. 2. The ruthenium catalyst gives selectivity to vinyl chloride, in comparison with the palladium and rhodium/ zinc catalysts which are much more active but form saturated hydrocarbon predominantly. The commercial dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane is performed at 450-550 C under a pressure of 4 MPa [10]. Many byproducts are formed from the reaction, and in order to decrease the amount of byproduct formation the conversion level is maintained at 50-60ss'o. A selectivity of 95-98ss'o to vinyl chloride can be achieved under these reaction conditions. It should be noted that the ruthenium chloride-based catalyst operates at much lower pressures and temperatures. A series of bi- and trimetallic doped systems were investigated. Though none of the systems improved upon the selectivity of the ruthenium chloridedoped system, some interesting changes in product distribution resulted that are not fully understood and not pursued further because the desired result, a dehydrohalogenation catalyst more effective than the ruthenium system, was not obtained.

Getty Steven C. Petrosius Russell S. Drago University of Florida, Department of Chemistry, Gainesville, FL 32611 U.S.A. A series of novel, solid strong acids has been prepared by treatment of inorganic oxides with Lewis acids and metal chlorides. The objective is to create four-coordinate, as opposed to the usual six-coordinate, aluminum centers on inorganic oxides which should result in strong acid catalysts. Several novel metal-doped solid acid catalysts combine this strong acidity with metal dopant reactivities to attain the selectivity of non-radical pathways. These new solid acid catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity for the dehydrochlorination and hydrodechlorination of various polychlorinated molecules.
