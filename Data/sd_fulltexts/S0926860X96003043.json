In addition to aqueous impregnation with alkali nitrates, two non-aqueous methods based on alkali carbonates were used to achieve alkali promotion resulting in long-term and high-temperature stable catalysts. For the reliable determination of the Ru particle size, the combined application of H2 chemisorption, TEM and XRD was found to be necessary. The power-law rate expressions were derived at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar which were shown to be efficient tools to investigate the degree of interaction of the alkali promoter with the Ru metal particles. The following sequence with respect to the turnover frequency (TOF) of NH3 formation was found: Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO > CsNO3-Ru/MgO > Ru/MgO > Ru/K-A1203 > Ru/AI203. The Cs-promoted Ru/MgO catalysts turned out to be more active than a multiply- promoted Fe catalyst at atmospheric pressure with an initial TOF of about 10-2 s-l for the non-aqueously prepared Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst at 588 K. The strong inhibition by H2 was found to require a lower molar H2:N2 ratio in the feed gas than 3:1 in order to achieve a high effluent NH3 mole fraction. The optimum ratio for Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO at 50 bar was determined to be about 3:2, resulting in an effluent NH3 mole fraction which was just a few percent lower than that of a multiply-promoted Fe catalyst operated at 107 bar and at roughly the same temperature and space velocity. Thus, alkali-promoted Ru catalysts are an alternative to the conventionally used Fe catalysts for NH3 synthesis also at high pressure.

Introduction Alkali-promoted Ru-based catalysts are expected to become the second generation NH3 synthesis catalysts [1 ]. Based on the Kellogg Advanced Ammo- nia Process (KAAP), the 600 t NH3/day Ocelot NH3 synthesis plant started to produce NH3 in 1992 using promoted Ru catalysts supported on carbon [2]. The Ru-based catalysts permit milder operating conditions compared with the mag- netite-based systems, such as low synthesis pressure (70-105 bar compared with 150-300 bar) and lower synthesis temperatures, while maintaining higher conversion than a conventional system [2]. It is known that chlorine acts as severe poison in NH3 synthesis over Ru catalysts [3-5]. The addition of chlorine to chlorine-free precursors was found to create about six activated adsorption sites for H2 per chlorine adatom [3]. Hence, in recent kinetic studies, chlorine-free Ru complex compounds like Ru3(CO)I2 [6-8] or Ru(NO)(NO3)3 [9] were used in the preparation. Aika et al. [8] demonstrated that MgO is one of the most effective supports for Ru. The Cs-promoted Ru on MgO (CsNO3-Ru/MgO) prepared from chlorine-free Ru3(CO)I2 was found to be as highly active for NH3 synthesis as CsNO3-Raney Ru or as K-promoted Ru on activated carbon [8]. Alkali-promoted catalysts are usually prepared by impregnation with aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts such as CsNO3 [8]. Datye et al. [10] showed that aqueous impregnation of MgO may lead to severe morphologic changes due to the partial transformation to the hydroxide phase. The present study reports on two novel water-free methods using alkali carbonates for the preparation of alkali-promoted Ru catalysts supported on MgO and A1203 to achieve long-term and high-temperature stability. The first method uses a solution of Cs2CO3 in ethanol for the impregnation of Ru/MgO resulting in a significantly higher catalytic activity than the conventionally prepared CsNO3-Ru/MgO catalyst. The second method employs a K2CO3-pretreatment of the y-alumina support prior to the impregnation with the solution of Ru3(CO)12 in THF. The pretreat- ment was carried out at 1153 K corresponding to the preparation temperature of mixed oxides of the /3-alumina type. The structure of /3-alumina consists of spinel-type (AljlOl6)+ blocks separated by mirror planes in which mobile K ions are located together with oxygen anions bridging the blocks. Compounds with the /3-alumina structure are usually non-stoichiometric having nominal compositions of e.g., K/A1 = 1/6 [11]. Busca et al. [12] recently performed a surface characterization of Ba-/3-alumina which is applied as support for gas- turbine combustion catalysts due to its high thermochemical stability. Their results provide evidence for a predominant basic character of the Ba-/3-alumina surface [12]. Moggi et al. [6] carried out a pretreatment of the surface of T-A1203 with KOH followed by calcination in air at 773 K for 8 h. In the present study, information about the particle size distribution was obtained from H2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and F. Rosowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 443-460 445 X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is shown that the combined application of all three techniques is necessary for a reliable assessment of the Ru metal particle size. A modified volumetric sorption set-up was used which allows H2 chemisorption and conversion measurements to be carded out in the same U-tube to avoid transfer artifacts due to the formation of hydroxides and carbonates in air. In our laboratory, a systematic study is in progress aiming at a detailed understanding of the catalytic phenomena involved in the synthesis of ammonia on ruthenium. In spite of the industrial importance, relatively few studies in the catalytic literature deal with the kinetics of NH3 synthesis over supported Ru catalysts [9,13-17]. These studies focus on the influences of PNn3' PN2 and Pn: on the rate of NH3 formation mostly at atmospheric pressure. Alkali promotion was found to decrease the inhibition by NH3 significantly and to give rise to a strong inhibiting effect of He [9,15,16]. On multiply-promoted Fe catalysts, H2 has a positive reaction order due to high coverages of adsorbed atomic nitrogen (N-* ) [18]. The reaction order for N2 was found to be essentially in unity for both Ru and Fe catalysts indicating that the dissociative chemisorption of N2 is the rate-determining step (rds). To our knowledge, reaction orders for N2 and H: at high pressures have not been published yet for supported Ru catalysts. In his review about \"Alternative Non-iron Catalysts,\" Tennison [1] provides some kinetic data at high pressure illustrating that a lower PHJPN2 ratio than 3 is favorable for Ru-based catalysts under industrial synthesis conditions without, however, specifying the active metal area. Recently, Kowalczyk et al. [17] reported the results of NH3 synthesis rate measurements at high pressures in which the active metal area was not specified either. In the latter study, it was observed that a K-promoted Ru catalyst supported on carbon is much less sensitive to high NH3 partial pressures and consequently more active than a triply-promoted Fe catalyst under these conditions [17]. It is the main intention of the present study to present both kinetic data sets obtained at pressures up to 50 bar and the results of Ru metal area measurements from which turn-over frequencies (TOF) are derived. Moreover, power-law rate expressions r = kapp\" P~H3\" P~:'P~: were determined both at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar. The kinetic data set is intended to serve as the basis for a detailed microkinetic analysis of NH3 synthesis kinetics [ 19,20] following the concepts by Dumesic et al. [21]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation The catalysts were prepared from high purity A1203 (99.99%, Johnson Matthey) or MgO (Puratronic, 99.996% metals basis, Johnson Matthey) and Ru3(CO)12 (Johnson Matthey, 99%) by wet impregnation in a rotary evaporator 446 F. Rosowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)443-460 following the procedures in Refs. [8,6,22]. The achieved metal loading was about 5 wt.% Ru. In both cases, 1.5 g of the catalyst support were heated in high vacuum at 773 K for 6 h and then dispersed in a solution of 0.157 g Ru3(CO)~2 in 60 ml THFab, for 4 h at room temperature. The impregnation was carried out under inert gas atmosphere to avoid contact with air and moisture. After evaporating the solvent at 313 K, the slightly orange powder was pressed at a pressure of 1.6 MPa into cylindrical pellets which were subsequently crushed and sieved. The 250-800 ~zm sieve fraction was slowly heated in high vacuum up to 723 K to decompose the carbonyl precursor yielding dark gray grains. The alkali-promoted catalysts CsNO3-Ru/MgO and CsNO3-Ru/AI203 were obtained by impregnating the supported Ru catalysts Ru/MgO or Ru/A1203 with solutions of CsNO3 (99.99%, Strem) in a mixture of acetone-water -- 9/1 (vol./vol.). Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO was prepared non-aqueously by impregnation with a solution of Cs2CO3 (ultrapure, Johnson Matthey) in absolute ethanol. After stirring the suspension for 3 h, the solvent evaporated and the catalysts were dried in vacuum. The atomic ratios were Cs:Ru -- 1:1 for CsNO3-Ru/MgO and Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO and Cs:Ru = 3:1 for CsNO3-Ru/AI203. All catalysts were hygroscopic and were stored in a desiccator. The Ru/K-AI203 catalyst was prepared by heating a thoroughly ground mixture of 1.385 g A1203 (99.99%, Johnson Matthey) and 0.176 g K2CO3 (analytical grade, Merck) in a platinum crucible at 1158 K in air for 15 h following the procedure developed by Scholder and Mansmann [11 ] to produce a ternary oxide of the /3-alumina type with a stoichiometry of K20.11 A1203. The reaction temperature was chosen to be close to the melting point of K2CO3 at 1164 K. At temperatures above 1273 K, y-Al~O3 transforms into ce-A1203 [23]. Subsequently, the wet impregnation with Ru3(CO)j2 was carried out as described above. 2.2. Characterization of the catalysts The Ru metal area was determined by volumetric H2 chemisorption in the quartz U-tube of an Autosorb 1-C set-up (Quantachrome) following the proce- dure described in Ref. [24]. Prior to chemisorption, the catalysts were reduced by passing 80 cm3 (STP)/min high-purity synthesis gas (Pn2/PN2 = 3/1) from a connected feed system through the U-tube and heating up to 673 K for alkali-promoted catalysts or up to 773 K for alkali-free catalysts with a heating rate of 60 K/h. The NH3 mole fraction in the effluent was analyzed at steady-state by a non-dispersive infrared detector (BINOS, Fisher-Rosemount) to determine the catalytic activity. The BET area was measured by static N2 physisorption in the same set-up. The TEM morphologies were analyzed in a Siemens Elmiskop 102 instru- ment at 100 keV. Samples were deposited from a slurry in hexane onto F. Rosowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)443-460 447 carbon-coated Cu grids and predried before insertion. The XRD data were collected in transmission with a Stoe Stadi P instrument using monochromated Cu K~I radiation and a position-sensitive detector. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was determined by fitting pseudo-Voigt line profiles. 2.3. Kinetic measurements The kinetic experiments were carried out in an all stainless steel microreactor flow system with three gas lines (Ar, N2, H2) which were operated at pressures up to 100 bar. The gases had all a purity of 99.9993%, and were further purified by means of a self-designed guard reactor [25]. The flows were controlled by electronic mass flow controllers and the temperatures by microprocessor con- trollers. The reactor consisted of a glass-lined stainless steel U-tube with an inner diameter of 3.8 mm which was placed in a copper block oven. The effluent mole fraction of NH3 was determined by a non-dispersive infrared detector (BINOS, Fisher-Rosemount) which was calibrated by using a reference gas mixture (Linde). Limitations by heat or mass transport were avoided by using 138 mg of the 250 txm-800 p~m sieve fraction for the kinetic experiments resulting in bed heights of < 15 nun. The reduction was carried out in a flow of 80 cm3 (STP)/min synthesis gas with a heating ramp of 60 K/h up to 673 K. The absence of poisoning by oxygen-containing compounds was tested as described in Ref. [25]. It was possible to run steady-state NH3 synthesis at temperatures as low as 500 K. All catalysts were tested for a period of 24 days at least. 3. Results and discussion 3. I. Characterization of the catalysts The results of the BET measurements are summarized in Table 1. As expected, y-A1203 turned out to be the chemically and mechanically more stable support with a higher surface area than MgO. Only as a result of aqueous alkali Table 1 Results of the BET measurements after drying the supports in high vacuum at 773 K for 6 h, after impregnation with Ru3(CO)12 and NH3 synthesis at 773 K, and after impregnation with Ru3(CO)12, thermal decomposition in vacuum, alkali impregnation and NH3 synthesis at 673 K Sample BET area (m2/g) Sample BET area (m2/g) MgO 51.6 A1203 110.0 Ru/MgO 25.0 Ru/Al203 104.4 CsNO3 -Ru/MgO 23.0 CsNO3 -Ru/Al203 70.0 CszCO3-Ru/MgO 21.0 Ru/K-A1203 91.0 448 F. Rosowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 443-460 impregnation, the surface area was found to decrease significantly from 104 m2/g to 70 m2/g. For MgO, 52 m2/g were observed after drying in high vacuum at 773 K. For Ru/MgO, however, the specific area was found to be only 25 m2/g after NH3 synthesis at 773 K. After the strong initial loss in surface area, alkali impregnation led to a further decrease by only 2 m2/g. Aika et al. [8] observed a similar decrease in surface area from 90 m2/g to 36 m2/g for a 2 wt.% Ru/MgO catalyst as a result of aqueous promotion with CsNO3 in the molar ratio of Cs:Ru = 1:1. High surface areas of MgO are obviously not stable under typical catalytic conditions. The H2 chemisorption results are summarized in Table 2. The H2 monolayer capacities were used to derive Ru metal dispersions and mean particle sizes assuming spherical particles. On both MgO and A1203, the impregnation with Ru3(CO)12 resulted in mean particle sizes of about 2 nm after NH3 synthesis at 773 K. It is remarkable that essentially the same Ru metal areas were obtained on MgO and A1203 inspite of the largely differing BET areas of the supports. For Ru/MgO, a specific Ru metal area of 14.4 m2/g was obtained initially after NH3 synthesis at 673 K. Increasing the NH3 synthesis temperature to 773 K was found to decrease the metal area to 12.9 mZ/g equivalent to a particle size of 1.9 nm. For the Ru/MgO catalyst impregnated with the aqueous solution of CsNO3, the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen was found to be reduced by about a factor of two. Aika et al. [8] also observed a decrease from 136 txmol Hz/g to 104 p~mol Hz/g for a 5 wt.% Ru/MgO catalyst as a result of impregnation with an aqueous CsNO3 solution in the molar ratio of Cs:Ru = 1:1. These observations raise the question whether the loss in metal area is due to site blocking as suggested by Nwalor and Goodwin [9] for K-Ru/SiO2 or due to an increase in particle size. The TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 1 reveal that the particle size distribu- tion of Ru/MgO (Fig. 1A) is fairly homogeneous with an average value of about 2 nm in good agreement with the result obtained by H2 chemisorption. The Ru metal particles are seen to be evenly distributed over the MgO particles which have a cubic morphology to some extent. However, the TEM micrograph Table 2 Results of the H2 chemisorption measurements after NH3 synthesis based on H:Ru = 1:1. The NH3 synthesis was run at 773 K with Ru/MgO and Ru/AI203, and at 673 K with all alkali-promoted catalysts.

The original magnification was 300000. of CsNO3-Ru/MgO (Fig. 1C) displays a rather non-uniform particle size distribution with particle sizes ranging from 3 nm to 10 nm. The largest particles appear to be hexagonally shaped. Fig. 1D shows a TEM micrograph of CsNO3-Ru/A1203. The contrast of the metal particles in Fig. 1D is signifi- cantly lower compared with the MgO-based catalysts. However, the absence of larger Ru particles as seen in Fig. 1C for CsNO3-Ru/MgO can clearly be confirmed. The estimated particle size of about 2-3 nm demonstrates that the Ru/A1203 catalyst was not significantly affected by the impregnation with CsNO3 in agreement with the minor increase in particle size from 2.1 nm to 2.5 nm derived from H2 chemisorption. The increase in size of the Ru metal particles on MgO due to Cs impregnation is further corroborated by the XRD results shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction pattern of Ru/MgO after NH3 synthesis at 773 K (upper trace in Fig. 2) reveals only the presence of highly crystalline MgO. This is in agreement with the Ru particle size of about 2 nm determined by means of H2 chemisorption and TEM since such a particle size lies below the detection limit of the diffractometer. For the CsNOa-Ru/MgO catalyst, an additional weak diffraction pattern is ob- served which originates from Ru metal.

Rosowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)443-460 451 contrary to CsNO3. To our knowledge, Cs2CO3 has not yet been used for this purpose presumably due to its high decomposition temperature of 880 K. The reduction of Cs2CO3 under NH3 synthesis conditions below 773 K should occur only in close contact with Ru metal particles which can provide atomic hydrogen. This assumption is supported by a significantly lowered onset temper- ature of CsNO3 reduction in the presence of Ru powder or RuC13 as observed by Aika et al. [26]. The H2 chemisorption results shown in Table 2 indicate that apparently the non-aqueous impregnation with Cs2CO3 led to even larger Ru particles than the aqueous process with CsNO3. The TEM micrograph of the Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst shown in Fig. 1B indeed reveals a non-uniform Ru particle size distribution. However, a considerable fraction of the 2-3 nm Ru particles is seen to be still present after Cs2CO3 impregnation as confirmed by the comparison with the TEM micrograph of Ru/MgO (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the mean size of the larger Ru particles detected by XRD is found to be considerably smaller as shown in Table 3. Thus, both TEM and XRD results indicate a significantly higher Ru metal area for the Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst compared with the CsNO3-Ru/MgO catalyst. The H2 chemisorption at room temperature may be blocked by the presence of Cs2CO3 species thus yielding only a lower limit to the actual Ru metal area. This conclusion is further supported by the signifi- cantly higher catalytic activity of the Cs 2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst compared with the CsNO3-Ru/MgO catalyst as will be discussed further. For the Ru/K-A1203 catalyst, a BET surface area of 91 m2/g (Table 1) was observed after NH3 synthesis. The Ru metal area of 12.6 m2/g is even somewhat higher than the Ru metal area of Ru/AI203. The XRD patterns of the T-A1203 support, the Ru/A1203 and the Ru/K-A1203 catalysts were found to be essentially identical within the experimental resolution. In order to prepare crystalline K-/3-alumina, higher amounts of K2CO3 (K:A1 = 1:6) and longer periods of calcination are necessary which, however, would presumably lead to a significant loss in specific surface area. 3.2. Kinetics at atmospheric pressure The results of the initial steady-state conversion measurements at atmospheric pressure are summarized in Fig. 3. The catalysts with MgO as support were found to have a significantly higher catalytic activity than the ones with A1203 as support. On both supports, alkali promotion increased the catalytic activity strongly. The non-aqueously prepared catalyst CszCO3-Ru/MgO turned out to be almost twice as active than the CsNO3-Ru/MgO catalyst prepared by aqueous impregnation. The Ru/K-AI203 catalyst was found to be nearly as active as CsNO3-Ru/AI203. The activity of the Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst exceeded that of a multiply-promoted Fe-based catalyst significantly.

The values of the TOF at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar derived from the steady-state kinetic measurements after at least 14 days on stream are summa- rized in Table 4. For the calculation of the TOF, the Ru metal areas specified in Table 2 were used. The alkali-promoted catalysts were found to deactivate to some extent initially. It is evident that alkali promotion is mandatory to obtain highly active NH3 synthesis catalysts. Comparing the TOFs at 588 K reveals that the difference between the least active Ru/AI203 catalyst and the most active Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst is almost two orders of magnitude.

The reaction order of N2 is found to be close to 1.0 reflecting that the dissociative chemisorption of N2 is the rate-determining step of NH3 synthesis for all catalysts under all experimental conditions studied. Contrary to the results obtained by Aika et al. [15] and Baris et al. [16], the reaction order for He was negative for all catalysts investigated. The positive reaction order for H2 reported by Aika et al. [15] and Baris et al. [16] for Ru/A1203 and Ru/MgO may be due to the presence of chlorine originating from RuC13 used for the catalyst preparation. The reaction orders indicate a rather low fractional coverage of atomic nitrogen (ON) under synthesis conditions which is further decreased in the case of alkali-promoted catalysts. On Fe-based catalysts, the catalytic activity is significantly reduced at high XNH3 leading to high ON blocking further N2 dissociation [18]. This effect is obviously absent on Ru surfaces. The interaction of N2 with supported Ru catalysts has been studied recently in great detail [28,29]. In our recent publication about the interaction of N2 with Ru/MgO, it was assumed that a small fraction of the total Ru metal area dominated the rate of NH3 synthesis, and that such promoted sites might originate from the interaction with the MgO support [29]. Comparing the power-law rate expressions of Ru/MgO and Ru/AlzO3 listed in Table 5 reveals that the rate of NH3 synthesis over Ru/MgO is somewhat less inhibited by NH3 and somewhat stronger inhibited by H2. However, the differences are rather small and do therefore not allow to identify Ru/MgO as alkaline-earth promoted catalyst. Following the approach by Holzman et al. [14], Arrhenius plots at constant XNH3 F. Rosowski et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)443-460 455 were used to derive apparent activation energies Uax from conversion measure- ments at atmospheric pressure. For Ru/A1203, a value of 100 kJ/mol was obtained with 150 ppm < XNH3 < 600 ppm which is significantly higher than the value of 70 kJ/mol obtained at constant flow. For Ru/MgO, a value of 68 kJ/mol was obtained with 500 ppm <XNH3 < 1250 ppm which is almost identical to the value of 69 kJ/mol obtained at constant flow. Thus, the different values of E~x point out that the kinetics of NH3 synthesis over Ru/MgO and Ru/A1203 differ more than indicated by the reaction orders. Shiflett and Dumesic [4] used the determination of Ea~x for various supported Ru catalysts to elucidate the role of the support and the effect of chlorine in terms of electronic interactions. According to the three criteria derived from the power-law kinetics, both non-aqueously prepared catalysts belong among the alkali-promoted catalysts (Table 5). This implies the presence of mobile alkali species on both catalyst surfaces, originating either from the reduction of Cs2CO3 or from the K2CO3- pretreated \"y-AI203 support, which are able to diffuse onto the Ru metal surfaces. Hence, alkali promotion can also be brought about by an alkali doping of the support thus avoiding another impregnation of the supported Ru catalyst. Since the power-law kinetics of Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO and CsNO3-Ru/MgO are virtually the same, the higher rate of NH3 formation per weight of the former catalyst must result from a higher specific number of Cs-promoted active sites under synthesis conditions, inspite of the apparently lower specific Ru metal area determined by H2 chemisorption at room temperature. Thus, the different TOF values reported for the two Cs-Ru/MgO catalysts in Table 4 should be considered an artifact arising from the Ru area determination by H2 chemisorption as already suggested by the comparison of the TEM, XRD, and H2 chemisorption results in the preceding section. For the reliable determination of the active Ru metal area, N2 chemisorption turned out to be a valuable tool [19,29]. 3.3. Long-term and high-temperature stability For the industrial application of alkali-promoted Ru catalysts, the long-term and high-temperature stability is of great importance. Since the presence of the alkali promoter is essential for high conversions, the stability of the Ru catalysts is correlated with the stability of the alkali promoter. After more than 100 h on stream, the non-aqueously prepared catalysts were heated up to 773 K for 4 h in a flow of 40 cm3 (STP)/min synthesis gas initially followed by periodic temperature changes. Fig. 5 displays the resulting effluent NH3 mole fractions and the corresponding temperature profiles observed for Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO (left half) and Ru/K-AI203 (right half) as a function of time on stream. At 773 K, the value of 1400 ppm for XNH3 is determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium for both catalysts. Hence, XNH~ passed through a maximum when 456 F.

The corresponding temperature profiles are shown as dashed lines. heating both catalysts up to 773 K. The decrease of XNH3 from 4750 ppm to 3600 ppm observed at 588 K for the Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO catalyst after 8 h at 773 K indicates that the catalyst indeed deactivated to some extent due to the heat treatment. However, after the second heat treatment, no further changes of the catalytic activity were found until the end of the run after 42 days on stream. For Ru/K-A1203, the deactivation from XNU3 = 1350 ppm to 1190 ppm observed at 673 K was less strong, and the catalytic activity was found to be stable already after the first heat treatment at 773 K. The reaction orders of Ru/K-AI203 derived both prior and subsequent to ammonia synthesis at 773 K (Table 5) reveal that the degree of interaction of the K + O promoter with the Ru particles changed significantly. The increased inhibition by NH3, the decreased inhibition by H2 and the decrease in apparent activation energy indicate a transition from an efficiently alkali-promoted state to a less promoted state. It is plausible to assume that the K + O promoter was removed from the Ru metal surfaces at 773 K by desorption and diffusion to the support. Hence, only the interface between the Ru metal particles and the K-doped A1203 support should be promoted corresponding to Ru/MgO. This assumption is supported by the similar reaction orders of Ru/MgO and Ru/K- A1203 after ammonia synthesis at 773 K. The greater affinity of Cs + O to the acidic Al203 support is presumably also the reason why the promotion with Cs is much more efficient on the basic MgO support (Fig. 3). This conclusion is supported by the results of recent XPS/ISS measurements [30]. F. Rosowski et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 443-460 3.4. Kinetics at high pressure 457 The reaction orders of N2 and H2 for alkali-promoted catalysts were found to compensate each other almost completely in the kinetically controlled tempera- ture regime both at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar. Thus, an increase in total pressure from 1 bar to 50 bar (traces A-D in Fig. 6) with a constant synthesis gas composition of XH2:XN2 = 3:1 did not lead to a significant increase in conversion for CsNO3-Ru/A1203 at low temperatures. The analysis of the power-law kinetics therefore raises the question whether alkali-promoted Ru catalysts can be applied under industrial high-pressure synthesis conditions. Due to the inhibiting effect of XH2, and the accelerating effect of XN~, it is obvious that the 3:1 ratio of XH2:XN2 has to be decreased in order to obtain higher rates of NH3 formation. However, non-stoichiometric feed-gas compositions are less favorable because of thermodynamic reasons. Hence, the Xla2:XN2 ratio was varied between 5:95 and 75:25 at 50 bar using Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO to find a compromise between kinetics and thermodynamics. The resulting steady-state XNH3 as a function of temperature using a total flow of 100 cm3 (STP)/min is shown in Fig. 7. The ratio of XNH:XN: = 5:95 (trace A) leads to a significant rate of NH3 formation at temperatures as low as 520 K. When the temperature was higher than about 570 K, XNH~ was controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium leading to a decrease in XNH~.

Finally, the activity of Cs2CO3-Ru/MgO under these optimized conditions is compared in Table 6 with the kinetic data published by Nielsen [33] using a multiply-promoted Fe catalyst (KMIR).

Conclusions The preparation of Ru catalysts from Ru3(CO)12 and high-purity supports resulted in long-term stable catalysts for NH3 synthesis. For the reliable assessment of the Ru particle size, the combined application of H2 chemisorp- tion, TEM and XRD was found to be necessary yielding about 2 nm as average Ru particle size on MgO and A1203. Impregnating Ru/MgO with aqueous solutions of CsNO3 was observed to cause a significant increase of the Ru particle size contrary to Ru/A1203 with essentially unchanged Ru particle sizes. The non-aqueous impregnation of Ru/MgO with Cs2CO3 in ethanol was found to be less detrimental to the Ru metal dispersion resulting in the most active catalyst with an initial TOF at 588 K of about 10-2 s-1. On Ru/MgO, promotion with Cs was found to result in a higher increase in TOF than on Ru/A1203 presumably due to a stronger degree of interaction between the Cs promoter and the acidic A1203 support. The determination of the apparent activation energy at constant xN~3 provided additional evidence that the higher TOF of Ru/MgO compared with the TOF of Ru/A1203 originates from the promotion by the alkaline earth support. Unpromoted catalysts are hardly active for NH3 synthesis, whereas the catalytic activity of efficiently Cs-promoted catalysts exceeds that of a multiply-promoted Fe cata- lyst at atmospheric pressure. The rate of NH3 formation over all catalysts was found to be inhibited by H2. The power-law rate expressions derived at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar provided three criteria for the effect of alkali promotion in addition to the increase in TOF by almost two orders of magnitude: First, the reaction order of NH3 is changed to essentially zero, second, the reaction order of H2 is more negative, and third, the apparent activation energy determined at constant flow is increased. These criteria can be used as tools to elucidate the degree of interaction of the alkali promoter with the Ru metal particles. According to the power-law kinetics, pretreating A1203 with K2CO3 prior to impregnation with Ru3(CO)12 resulted in a promoted catalyst which changed to a less promoted state when heating up to 773 K in synthesis gas. Due to the inhibiting effect of H2, a lower XH2:XN2 ratio has to be used under high pressure NH3 synthesis conditions. For Cs2COa-Ru/MgO at 50 bar, the optimum ratio was found to be around 3:2, leading to an effluent XNH3 which was just a few percent lower than that of a multiply-promoted Fe catalyst operated at 107 bar with roughly the same space velocity at nearly the same temperature. Hence, the alkali-promoted Ru catalysts can indeed be developed into a low-pressure alternative to the conventional Fe catalysts. 460 F.

Supported Ru catalysts for NH3 synthesis were prepared from Ru3(CO)12 and high-purity MgO and Al2O3. In addition to aqueous impregnation with alkali nitrates, two non-aqueous methods based on alkali carbonates were used to achieve alkali promotion resulting in long-term and high-temperature stable catalysts. For the reliable determination of the Ru particle size, the combined application of H2 chemisorption, TEM and XRD was found to be necessary. The power-law rate expressions were derived at atmospheric pressure and at 20 bar which were shown to be efficient tools to investigate the degree of interaction of the alkali promoter with the Ru metal particles. The following sequence with respect to the turnover frequency (TOF) of NH3 formation was found: Cs2CO3Ru MgO > CsNO3Ru MgO > Ru MgO > Ru KAl2O3 > Ru Al2O3 . The Cs-promoted Ru MgO catalysts turned out to be more active than a multiply-promoted Fe catalyst at atmospheric pressure with an initial TOF of about 10−2 s−1 for the non-aqueously prepared Cs2CO3Ru MgO catalyst at 588 K. The strong inhibition by H2 was found to require a lower molar H2:N2 ratio in the feed gas than 3:1 in order to achieve a high effluent NH3 mole fraction. The optimum ratio for Cs2CO3Ru MgO at 50 bar was determined to be about 3:2, resulting in an effluent NH3 mole fraction which was just a few percent lower than that of a multiply-promoted Fe catalyst operated at 107 bar and at roughly the same temperature and space velocity. Thus, alkali-promoted Ru catalysts are an alternative to the conventionally used Fe catalysts for NH3 synthesis also at high pressure.
