The understanding of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces at the molecular level is important for guiding further the polyelectrolyte-based electrocatalysis. Herein, we demonstrate an in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic method by using a three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell towards characterizing the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces. The Ag/AgCl and Ag/Ag2O electrodes are used as the reference electrode in the acidic and the alkaline systems, respectively. The working electrode is made of a transparent carbon thin film which loads the electrocatalysts. The applications of this method are demonstrated through the in-situ characterizations of the p-methylthiophenol adsorbed on the Au and Pt and the electrochemical oxidation of Au on polyelectrolyte membranes. The potential-dependent spectral features of these two systems show that this method is a powerful tool for investigating the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces in electrocatalysis. Graphical Abstract An in-situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is developed towards investigating the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces in electrocatalysis. Keywords Polyelectrolyte In-situ electrochemical characterization Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy Three-electrode cell Au oxidation Electrocatalysis mainly pursues facilitating electrochemical reactions through reducing the activation barrier, which is ubiquitous in electrochemical applications. Fundamentally, the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, where the electrochemical reactions take place, play significant roles in electrocatalysis [1]. For example, it has been reported that the binding energy of the surface intermediates of electrochemical reactions determines the rate of electrocatalysis, such as the oxygen reduction reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction [2–5]. The coupling between electron-transfer and proton-transfer in the electrochemical double layer primarily contributes to the barrier of CO2 reduction reaction [6,7]. Polyelectrolytes have been used in more and more electrochemical applications, such as fuel cell, battery, electrolyzer, etc. [8–12]. Being similar to the conventional liquid electrolyte solutions, the polyelectrolyte is responsible for delivering the electrochemical current and acts as one component of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Besides, polyelectrolytes also have some specific characters. For example, either cation or anion is mobile in usual polyelectrolytes, which makes a unique electrode/electrolyte interface. Thus, it is highly desirable to reveal the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces towards understanding and optimizing the electrocatalysis in polyelectrolyte-based electrocatalysis. Some efforts have been made to develop in-situ electrochemical spectroscopic methods for investigating the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces [13–22]. In-situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) is a powerful tool for diagnosing the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, because it is highly sensitive to the surface species on an electrode and good at detecting the vibrations with low frequencies (lower than 500 cm–1) [23–26]. So far, EC-SERS has been successfully used to investigate the electrode/electrolyte interfaces of conventional electrocatalysis in liquid electrolytes. For example, the hydrogenated nitrobenzene species were found to be the surface intermediates of electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene on Au [27]. The benzyl-silver complexes adsorbed on Ag were identified at the intermediate stage of electrocatalytic reduction of benzyl chloride [28,29]. The surface carbonated species were found to be the intermediates of electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol [30]. The intermediates of peroxide reduction and nitrate reduction on polycrystalline Au electrodes were characterized [31,32]. By using the advanced method of shell-isolated nanoparticles-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, the surface oxygenated species were considered as the intermediates of water oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction on single crystalline electrodes [33]. These fingerprints of metal/electrolyte interfaces in electrocatalysis as revealed by EC-SERS are key evidences for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalysis. Nonetheless, it remains technically difficult to characterize the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface by using EC-SERS. The polyelectrolyte covering on electrode surface seriously prevents efficiently illuminating laser onto the electrode and collecting Raman scattering. Here, we demonstrate a method of EC-SERS for studying the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 , the three-electrode cell is made through layer-by-layer stacking a quartz window, a transparent carbon film, a polyelectrolyte membrane, a platinum plate and a commercially available glassy carbon electrode. The system is sealed in a closed spectroelectrochemical cell where Ar is continuously purged during measurement. The SERS-active nanoparticles are loaded by the transparent carbon film supported by the Au grids, which is the working electrode. A Ag/AgCl and a Ag/Ag2O electrode is used as the reference electrode for the acidic polyelectrolyte and the alkaline one, respectively. The platinum plate is used as the counter electrode and the glassy carbon electrode is responsible for conducting the electric current flowing through the platinum plate. The p-methylthiophenol (PMTP) adsorbed on Au nanoparticles and Au-core@Pt-shell (Au@Pt) nanoparticles were employed as a model to demonstrate the in-situ EC-SERS measurements of the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces. The electrochemical oxidation of Au in the metal/polyelectrolyte interface was measured, which shows the capability of studying the electrocatalysis on the polyelectrolyte membrane by using our method. In prior to EC-SERS measurements, we examined whether the electrochemistry of the entire cell worked correctly and durably. See supporting information for the voltammograms of a commercial polycrystalline Au electrode in alkaline membranes and solutions. As a control, the voltammogram of a commercially available polycrystalline Au in 0.1 mol/L HClO4 was measured in a conventional electrochemical cell. An anodic plateau with the onset potential of 0.59 V and a broad cathodic peak at 0.40 V can be found in the voltammogram of Au nanoparticles in EC-SERS spectroelectrochemical cell, which is similar to the voltammetric features of the polycrystalline Au electrode on Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane and in the liquid electrolyte. The similar features of these voltammograms indicate that the manipulation of electrochemical potential and the measurement of current are correct and accurate in the spectroelectrochemical cell. In addition, the EC-SERS measurement usually takes some time up to several tens of minutes, which requires the shift of the reference electrode potential is as small as possible. The potentials of our homemade Ag/AgCl and Ag/Ag2O electrodes against the standard reference electrodes were tested. As shown in Fig. 2(b) , the potential of Ag/AgCl against the standard Hg/Hg2SO4 reference electrode in 0.1 mol/L HClO4 shifts from −0.1427 to −0.1426 V in 8 h, and that of Ag/Ag2O against the standard Hg/HgO reference electrode shifts from 0.2670 to 0.2720 V. These tiny shifts in the potential ensure that the potential of working electrode is durably controlled and thus the EC-SERS measurement in our three-electrode cells is reproducible. With the three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cells, we employed PMTP as a model to demonstrate the feasibility of revealing the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces by using EC-SERS. Fig. 3(a) shows the potential-dependent SERS spectra of PMTP adsorbed on Au in the Au/Nafion-polyelectrolyte-membrane interface. A series of SERS bands with the frequency of 794, 1014, 1076, 1181, 1209, 1378, 1483 and 1591 cm–1 are found, which have been assigned to the vibrational modes of PMTP [34]. With the shift of potential from −0.5 to 0.0 V, the spectral features remain, and the frequency of the SERS bands slightly shift and the intensity of SERS bands decreases a little bit. For example, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the band of 1075 cm–1 shifts to 1076 cm–1. Similar measurements were carried out on the alkaline quaternary ammonia poly (N-methyl-piperidine-co-p-terphenyl) (QAPPT) membrane to demonstrate the method is universally available. Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show the potential-dependent EC-SERS spectra of PMTP adsorbed on Au on QAPPT. The band shift and the change in intensity are similar to that on Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane. To demonstrate the application of our EC-SERS cell in studying the transition-metal/polyelectrolyte interfaces, we carried out the EC-SERS measurement of PMTP by using Au@Pt nanoparticles, where the SERS enhancement on Pt surface is from the electromagnetic field of Au core [35]. As shown in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f), the spectral features of PMTP on Au@Pt are similar to that on Au. The potential-dependent band shift is also observed (See Supporting Information for the spectra of PMTP on Au@Pt on QAPPT). These potential-dependent band shifts are actually from the vibrational Stark effect [36–39]. Essentially, the SERS frequency is determined by the vibrational force constant of the molecule adsorbed on the electrode surface which is under the polarization of the interfacial electrostatic field. Due to the anharmonicity, the vibrational force constant depends on the molecular structures (e.g. bond length and angle) at the equilibrium state. Once the electrochemical potential shifted, the interfacial electrostatic field in the electrode/electrolyte interface was changed accordingly. The molecular structures were modified as a result of the change in the interfacial electrostatic field, whose frequency is thus dependent of the applied potential. In other words, the potential-dependent SERS frequency indicates that the potential is applied in the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces in our three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell and the species in these interfaces can be characterized by using EC-SERS. The application of EC-SERS by using our three-electrode cell in studying the polyelectrolyte-based electrocatalysis was demonstrated by the in-situ identification of the surface species at the intermediate stage of the electrochemical oxidation of Au. The acidic Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane was used. According to the voltammogram in Fig. 2(a), the onset potential of the electrochemical oxidation of Au is 0.59 V approximately. Therefore, the potential-dependent SERS spectra were recorded at the potential span between 0.40 and 1.2 V to show a correlation between the spectral features and the electrochemical oxidation of Au. As shown in Fig. 4(a) , no SERS band is observed at 0.4 V. At the potentials positive to 0.7 V, two characteristic bands appear at 590 and 810 cm–1, which have been assigned to the surface amorphous Au (hydro-)oxides [40,41]. The intensity of these two bands raises as a result of the positive shift of potential, suggesting that the Au (hydro-)oxides grow. The growth of surface amorphous Au (hydro-)oxides is similar to that in 0.1 mol/L HClO4 solution. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the two characteristic bands of amorphous Au (hydro-)oxides appear and their intensity increases, when the potential shifts from 0.57 to 1.27 V. According to the potential-dependent SERS spectra, the onset potential of the Au electrochemical oxidation in HClO4 solution is a bit more negative than that on Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane, which can be ascribed to the difference in equilibrium potential as revealed by the voltammograms in Fig. 2(a). The consistent results regarding EC-SERS spectra and voltammograms indicate that the surface species during electrocatalysis can be characterized by using EC-SERS. In summary, an in-situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic method was developed towards investigating the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces in electrocatalysis. A three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell was applied in this method through layer-by-layer stacking electrodes and polyelectrolytes membranes for accurately controlling the potential of working electrode. The similar voltammetric features of Au in the spectroelectrochemical cell and the conventional electrochemical cell by using acid Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane evidence that the potential control and the current measurement on the working electrode work correctly and durably. The potential-dependent characteristic SERS bands of p-methylthiophenol adsorbed on Au and Au-core@Pt-shell nanoparticles with a high signal-to-noise ratio and the vibrational Stark effect were obtained by using acidic Nafion and alkaline QAPPT polyelectrolytes membranes. The characteristic SERS bands of Au (hydro-)oxides were recorded and correlated with the electrochemical oxidation of Au. These results show that the in-situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic method based on the three-electrode cell can be used to study the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces and identify the surface species at the intermediate stage of electrocatalysis.

The understanding of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces at the molecular level is important for guiding further the polyelectrolyte-based electrocatalysis. Herein, we demonstrate an in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic method by using a three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell towards characterizing the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces. The Ag/AgCl and Ag/Ag2O electrodes are used as the reference electrode in the acidic and the alkaline systems, respectively. The working electrode is made of a transparent carbon thin film which loads the electrocatalysts. The applications of this method are demonstrated through the in-situ characterizations of the p-methylthiophenol adsorbed on the Au and Pt and the electrochemical oxidation of Au on polyelectrolyte membranes. The potential-dependent spectral features of these two systems show that this method is a powerful tool for investigating the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces in electrocatalysis.",
