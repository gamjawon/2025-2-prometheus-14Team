Graphical abstract Interfacial engineering reveals insight for powering reaction kinetics in the complicated multistep catalysis reaction with multiphase-based charge-transfer/nontransfer processes. High performance of lithium-sulfur batteries have been dragged down by their shuttling behavior which is complicated multiphase transition-based 16-electron redox reactions of the S8/Li2S. In this article, the triple-phase interfaces of graphene-like carbon clusters on antimony trisulfide (C-Sb2S3) nanowires are tailored to design a multifunctional polysulfide host which can inhibit migration of polysulfides and accelerate conversion kinetics of redox electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from the triple-interface design of polysulfides/Sb2S3/carbon clusters, the C-Sb2S3 electrode not only anchors polysulfide migration by the synergistic effect of Sb, S, and C atoms as interfacial active sites, but also the graphene-like carbon clusters shorten the diffusion paths to further favor redox electron/ion transport through the liquid (electrolyte/polysulfide) and solid (Li2S/S8, carbon clusters, and Sb2S3)-based triple-phases. Therefore, these Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells possess high sulfur loading, excellent cycling stability, impressive specific capacity, and great rate capability. This work of interfacial engineering reveals insight for powering reaction kinetics in the complicated multistep catalysis reaction with multiphase evolution-based charge-transfer/non-transfer processes. Keywords Triple-phase interfaces Graphene-like carbon Antimony trisulfide High preformance Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technologies attract huge and substantial studies due to their great potential performance involving a large theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh/g, the high energy density of 2500 Wh/kg, and appropriate operating voltage range [1–3]. As an important cathodic material in Li-S batteries, the natural abundance of sulfur resources particularly sustains large-scale industrialized applications with the nontoxic nature of environmental benignity [1–3]. However, their high performance is not fully achieved in pure sulfur cathode-based Li-S batteries. One of the most intractable issues is the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide intermediates [1,2,4,5]. They could be dissolved in electrolytes and freely migrate between electrodes, inducing cathode corrosion, anode insulation, Coulombic efficiency reduction, and device failure [6–15]. To address these obstacles of polysulfide intermediates, many solutions have been proposed [1,4,16]. These are usually approached by designing appropriate hosts to physically/chemically inhibit polysulfide migration, mediate polysulfide conversion reactions, and accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics [1,4,16]. For example, Z. Chen group designs an anion-deficient antimony selenide (Sb2Se3- x ) as a host of polysulfides. They used the cathode with the host containing the solid sulfur powder and carbon nanotube, and prepared a Sb2Se3- x and reduced graphene oxide modified cell separator. The as-obtained Li-S cells give outstanding cyclability over 500 cycles at 1.0 C with a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.027 % per cycle, and suggest a large areal capacity under 7.46 mAh/cm2 and 8.1 mg/cm2 sulfur loading with 100cycles, and provide a superb rate capability from 0.2 C to 8.0 C [17]. It may offer an important insight on antimony selenide as hosts of polysulfides to further exhibit effective adsorptive and catalytic functionalities of antimony-based materials in the high-performance Li-S batteries [4,16,17]. In the meantime, research results revealed that, if the solvation of polysulfide intermediates is fully adsorbed on the interface of host materials, the redox electrochemical reaction of cathode would work through solid-phase reactions with slower kinetic processes [4,16,18,19]. That means that a certain amount of dissolved polysulfides might enhance the redox process of solid sulfur at the solid (electrode)-liquid (electrolyte) interface. Therefore, the growing studies show the significance of replacing solid sulfur powder (S8) with necessary solvation of long-chain polysulfide intermediates (Li2S8 or Li2S6) while at the same time confining the shuttle effect from short-chain polysulfides (Li2S4) in pursuit of better performance for Li-S batteries [4,16,18,19]. Furthermore, the redox electrochemical reactions of Li-S cells represent complicated multiphase evolution and multistep electron-transfer/non-transfer processes (solid S8 ↔ liquid Li2S8 ↔ liquid Li2S6 ↔ liquid Li2S4 ↔ solid Li2S2/Li2S) [20–23]. The simple catalytic interface might not cover the redox processes of the multi-chained polysulfides. Thus, the multi-phase interface with high electrocatalytic capability could improve the local concentration of polysulfide intermediates as active centers for solid precipitation and/or lowers the reduction barrier from polysulfide intermediates to Li2S2/Li2S, further powering the growth of Li2S2/Li2S on the initial nucleus [4,16–19,23–25]. Herein, we design a tailored triple-phase interface of graphene-like carbon clusters on antimony trisulfide nanowires (C-Sb2S3) to regulate the kinetics of redox reactions of polysulfides and enable the controllable redox conversions of the solid–liquid-solid phase of S8-polysulfides-Li2S2/Li2S via the powered evolution of redox reaction. To be specific, highly crystallized Sb2S3 nanowires provide abundant active sites for intimate interaction of liquid polysulfides and inhibit their free migration, while the one-dimensional uniform nanowire structure of Sb2S3 facilitates the rapid redox electron transfer of polysulfides electrochemical reaction without trapping electrons by defects and/or boundaries of the randomly accumulated structure of a particle-based electrode. More importantly, the interfacial distributed graphene-like carbon clusters of atomic structure give the atomic interacted sites uniformly for polysulfides which effectively guides the nucleation and growth of Li2S2/Li2S. Furthermore, Li-S cells using C-Sb2S3 as the polysulfide catalyst possess a large specific capacity (up to 1100 mAh/g at 2 cm2), long cycling stability under different current densities (490 mAh/g remained after 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA/cm2, and 410 mAh/g remained after 1000 cycles at 1.6 mA/cm2), the better rate capability (830 mAh/g at 5.0 mA/cm2), and cyclability under high sulfur loading (5 mg/cm2 at 3.2 mA/cm2). With the above advantages, the triple-phase interface of C-Sb2S3 boosts the uniform nucleation behavior of Li2S2/Li2S and realizes reversible electrochemical reactions at the atomic scale, and further inhibits blocky growth and aggregation of polysulfides. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis C-Sb2S3 materials were prepared through a solvothermal approach. Firstly, thiourea (0.75 g) was dissolved in ethanediol (60 mL) under magnetic stirring for 100–120 mins. Next, the mixed solution was rapidly added into antimonous chloride solution (0.75 g antimonous chloride and 0.75 g glucose in 60 mL ethanediol) with continuous magnetic stirring for 200–240 mins. Then, the 15 mL as-prepared solution was transferred to a 30 mL stainless steel Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by being sealed and then heated inside a conventional oven at 160–180 °C for 10–12 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the obtained products were collected and washed with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water. Last, as-obtained products were further carbonized at 450–550 °C for 3 h under Ar atmosphere with −0.1 MPa pressure. 2.2 Material characterization Structures of samples were evaluated by employing Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Rigaku-Smart Lab Advance). Morphologies and microstructures of samples were examined by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini instrument operated at 5–15 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mapping were acquired by adopting a JEOL ARM transmission electron microscope. In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific Nexsa XPS system with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation and a concentric hemispherical analyzer. Before all in-situ XPS measurements, batteries were disassembled inside an argon-filled glovebox, and the sample electrodes were carefully rinsed with 3 mL mixed solvents of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) with a volume ratio of 1:1. Samples were transferred with a specially-built airtight bottle from the glovebox to the spectrometer, to avoid air exposure during the entire sample preparation and transfer processes. All XPS data analysis was carried out with Avantage software. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, NETZSCH) were used to characterize the composition of the samples. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization Using a mixture (mass ratio) of 70% C-Sb2S3, 20% conductive carbon and 10% poly(vinylidene difluoride) in N-methylpyrrolidone as a solvent, the as-prepared C-Sb2S3 slurry was casted on the carbon cloth, and vacuum-dried at 120 °C for 24 h. 0.7–1.3 mg/cm2 of C-Sb2S3 or Sb2S3 are added to electrode. To prepare Li-S batteries in standard CR2032 coin cells, the C-Sb2S3 loaded cathodes were impregnated with a calculated volume of the 0.5 M Li2S6-containing catholyte. It was further paired with a high pure lithium metal anode and a Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane separator, and added with high purity electrolyte (1 mol/L LiTFSI and 0.5 mol/L LiNO3 in DOL/DME) with carbon paper protection of electrode. To prepare the 0.5 M Li2S6-containing catholyte, 1.6 g of sulfur powder (S8), 0.46 g of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and 0.69 g of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) were dispersed in 20 mL mixed solution of dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, 1:1, v:v) with 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The electrolyte was gently heated at 60 °C under continuous magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous solution. Next, 0.5 M Li2S6-containing catholyte (42 μL for 2 mg/cm2 of equivalent sulfur normalized to the cathode area) were dripped on the electrode, and dried for a while to remove the Li2S6-containing DOL/DME solvent. For example, to achieve a sulfur loading of 2 mg/cm2, the 42 μL of 0.5 M Li2S6-containing catholyte were added, and dried for a while to remove the DOL/DME solvent, then 36 μL pure electrolyte (1 mol/L LiTFSI and 0.5 mol/L LiNO3 in DOL/DME) were dripped on the electrode where the E/S ratio was controlled at 9 μL/mg. All as-assembled cells were activated processes before electrochemical tests. Galvanostatic charge and discharge experiments were controlled by a NEWARE, LANHE and MACCOR battery tester at various currents in the voltage range of 1.8–2.6 V (vs Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and chronoamperometric curves were performed on a CHI 660E potentiostat. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results were collected on a Gamry potentiostat. 2.4 Computational methods and models Based on first-principles calculations, the density functional theory (DFT) computations are implemented under Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The ion–electron interaction was considered by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [26–28]. The exchange–correlation potential is taken into account by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, and the electronic states are expanded by adopting the plane-wave basis set with a cutoff of 500 eV [26–28]. All atomic positions and geometries are fully relaxed until the total energy and ionic force tolerances approaching 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The Monkhorst-Pack scheme with a 3 × 3 × 1 mesh for substrates is considered for the k-space integration on the Brillouin zone. The surface slab model with a 1 × 5 supercell (S60Sb40) was employed to describe (200) surface of the orthorhombic-structured Sb2S3 (Fig. S4a-b). Besides, the four outermost layers are allowed to relax while the remaining layers are fixed at the optimized positions. And a vacuum distance of 15 Å was used to avoid interaction between the adjacent slabs. The calculated lattice constants of the optimized bulk Sb2S3 (Fig. S4c-d) without considering van der Waals interactions are a = 11.226 Å, b = 12.133 Å, c = 3.870 Å, which are much different from experimental results of a = 11.22 Å, b = 11.31 Å, c = 3.839 Å. Since the bulk Sb2S3 belongs to a layer-structured metal chalcogenide. Considering the layered structure in the bulk Sb2S3, the van der Waals interaction, which was carried out by the semi-empirical DFT-D3 correction, was taken into account. The DFT results with van der Waals corrections showed that the lattice constants a = 11.098 Å, b = 11.462 Å, c = 3.860 Å, which are in agreement with the experimental results and more accurate than calculations without van der Waals interactions. This indicates that van der Waals interaction plays a crucial role in calculating Sb2S3 systems. Thus, the subsequent computations are carried out with DFT-D3 correction. To evaluate the adsorption strength of lithium sulfides on the surface, the binding energy (E b) is proposed by E b = E total − E sub − E Li-s, where E total, E sub and E Li-s are total energies of the entire system, of substrate and lithium sulfides with lithium sulfides adsorption. A negative E b demonstrates that the Li-S species can be adsorbed on the substrate steadily, and a more negative E b implies the stronger adsorption capability. 3 Results and discussion C-Sb2S3 materials are analyzed by different spectroscopic characterizations. Crystallographic structures are identified by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern. Fig. 1 (a) presents broad diffraction peaks from 20° to 60° which are in agreement with the standard powder diffraction pattern of orthorhombic phase of Sb2S3 (JCPDS card No. 42-1393, space group Pbnm (62), a = 1.12 nm, b = 1.13 nm, c = 0.38 nm and Z = 4) [29,30]. All peaks of C-Sb2S3 are indexed by pure Sb2S3 materials without impurities such as oxides and carbides, indicating that carbon clusters are formed on the interface of Sb2S3 by coating. Moreover, the chemical state of C-Sb2S3 is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Sb 3d 5/2 spectra (Fig. 1b) provide predominant signals of Sb-S and Sb-O-C around 534 eV to 526 eV. The Sb-S might be from the intrinsic Sb2S3, while the SbOC could be from the oxygen groups adsorbed at the interface of Sb2S3 [17,29,30]. The S 2p spectra (Fig. 1c) show predominant signals of SSb and SO with 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks around 166 eV to 158 eV. The S-Sb could be from the intrinsic Sb2S3, and SO could be from the oxygen groups adsorbed at the interface of Sb2S3 [17,31]. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 1d) shows CC, CC, and CO bindings which come from the carbon clusters and oxygen groups on the Sb2S3 surface [32–34]. Morphologies of C-Sb2S3 are acquired from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Fig. 1(e) confirms the uniform morphology and the size distribution of a gained C-Sb2S3 with a diameter of 90 nm. The large-scale SEM images of C-Sb2S3 are shown in Fig. S1(a) (electronic supplementary data). This nanowire-based material can provide low-resistance routes for the redox electron movement [35–38]. Besides, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image demonstrates the highly crystalline feature with a lattice fringe of d-spacing of 0.57 nm (Fig. 1f), which could belong to the (200) plane in an orthorhombic phase of Sb2S3 crystal [29,30]. The legible diffraction spots (Fig. 1g) from apart of C-Sb2S3 are identified by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and the corresponding TEM image of C-Sb2S3 is given in Fig. S1(b). The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging (Fig. 1h) manifests atomic configurations of antimony to suggest its high crystallinity structure with potential good conductivity [29–31,39,40]. Fig. 1(i) reveals carbon clusters located on the C-Sb2S3 surface in which carbon atoms could tend to be graphene-like carbon atoms after the vacuum tube furnace heating. At the atomic scale, C-Sb2S3 can afford abundant active sites on the elaborate triple-phase interfaces of carbon clusters-Sb2S3-polysulfide with the synergistic effect of adsorption, catalysis, and conductivity to trigger the regular polysulfide conversion [4,18–23,35,39,41,42]. Fig. S1(c–f) shows the SEM image with the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of C-Sb2S3, which could demonstrate the uniform distribution of antimony, sulfur and carbon elements. In further experiments, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is carried out to evaluate the content of carbon in the C-Sb2S3 composite. Fig. S1(g) exhibits the TGA results of C-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3 under air atmosphere which can be ascribed to the conversion of materials into oxides during the calefactive processes in air. The weight loss of C-Sb2S3 is larger than Sb2S3 owing to the combustion of carbon with the release of gas in which the calculated carbon content is approximately 3%. To further investigate the enhancement of electrochemical properties of cathodes by C-Sb2S3, the cyclability of Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells (area: 2 cm2) are studied by a series of pure electrolyte/sulfur ratios (E/S) with 2 mg/cm2 sulfur loading at 1.6 mA/cm2 [43]. Fig. 2 (a) shows the cycling results of incremental E/S from 7.0 to 10 μL/mg. The Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells possess initial capacities of 1230 mAh/g at E/S = 10 μL/mg and 1200 mAh/g at E/S = 9.0 μL/mg, remain 960 mAh/g for the former one and 930 mAh/g for the latter one after 200 cycles. For the E/S conditions of 8.0 and 7.0 μL/mg, the Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells possess initial capacities of 1000 and 950 mAh/g, remain 800 and 770 mAh/g after 200 cycles, respectively. Fig. S1(h) shows discharge profiles of different E/S conditions in the activated processes of the first cycle. For the first discharge, the typical voltage plateau at approximately 2.3 V does not appear which is compared with conventional solid S8-based Li-S cells, due to the absence of its corresponding reduction reaction of S8 to Li2S6. Compared to a low E/S value, an increase of initial capacity occurs with a high E/S value. Also, similar performances of Li-S cells are containing 10 and 9.0 μL/mg. In the following, corresponding charge and discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 2(b). Two staged discharge plateaus and one charge plateau are acquired for distinct E/S conditions of Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells (around 2.4–1.8 V), delivering a different cell capacity. Further, the performance of Li-S cells is close to E/S of 10 and 9.0 μL/mg. Therefore, the E/S ratio is controlled to be 9.0 μL/mg as following cell testing conditions. To assess the catalytic performance of graphene-like carbon clusters on the Sb2S3 interface, a comparison of the cycling performance between the C-Sb2S3 cell and pure Sb2S3 cell is presented in Fig. 2(c). After 200 cycles, the C-Sb2S3 cell maintains 1000 mAh/g, and the pure Sb2S3 cell holds 700 mAh/g with 2 mg/cm2 sulfur mass loading at 1.6 mA/cm2. For comparison, the pure Sb2S3 cell shows substantially deteriorated capacity with the increased cycles, which indicates slow reaction kinetics of polysulfides in the Sb2S3 interface. Those corresponding charge and discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 2(d), where two different discharge plateaus are observed for the C-Sb2S3 and pure Sb2S3 cells. Previous studies [5,18,31] explored that the 2.4–2.0 V potentiostatic discharge is assigned to the reduction from higher-order polysulfides (Li2S8/Li2S6) to a high diffused polysulfide (Li2S4), and around 2.0 V potentiostatic discharge refers to the reduction of a high diffused polysulfide (Li2S4) to the mixed Li2S2/Li2S. In the first stage of 2.4–2.0 V, C-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3 cells exhibit similar processes of discharging curves, suggesting the high-order polysulfide reduction in the process of Li2S8/Li2S6 to Li2S4 (Fig. 2d). In the second stage of around 2.0 V, the C-Sb2S3 cell shows a stable and high voltage range along with the discharge capacity than that of the pure Sb2S3 cell, which suggests the C-Sb2S3 cell-based reduction of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S could be the heterogeneous nucleation and uniform growth of the solid phase without overcoming a larger activation barrier, and the reaction kinetics is boosted [4,18–23,42,44,45]. Furthermore, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is applied to further investigate the interaction between polysulfides and carbon clusters in the dynamic process of polysulfide migration [31,46]. During a GITT procedure (Fig. 2e-f), the galvanostatic discharge pulse holds 10 (or 1) mins, and followed by 1 (or 10) mins for relaxation without current through the cell. Next, the GITT charge procedure is involved with 10 (or 1) mins charge pulse and then 1 (or 10) mins relaxation. To sufficiently monitor the interaction of polysulfides and carbon clusters, 0.8 mA/cm2 of current, 2 mg/cm2 of sulfur mass loading, and 2 cm2 of area are selected for running Li-S cells. In Fig. 2(e), both C-Sb2S3 and pure Sb2S3 cells provide normal discharge/charge plateaus, delivering total discharge capacities of 1260 and 1000 mAh/g, respectively, which are from S8 to polysulfides (Li2S4) and then to Li2S2/Li2S. In the corresponding charge processes, C-Sb2S3 and pure Sb2S3 cells demonstrate an electrochemical transition process from Li2S2/Li2S to S8, offering total charge capacities of 1280 and 1041 mAh/g, respectively. Upon increasing the relaxation time (Fig. 2f), the C-Sb2S3 and Sb2S3 cells give 77 % and 65 % Coulombic efficiency (CE), respectively. The noticeable difference Coulombic efficiency implies that, compared to the pure Sb2S3, the graphene-like carbon clusters of C-Sb2S3 can decrease the polysulfide migration in Li-S batteries [21,23,31,42,43,46]. The long cycling stability of C-Sb2S3 based Li-S batteries are investigated (Fig. 3 a-c). These cells (area: 2 cm2) with 1.0 and 2 mg/cm2 sulfur loading offered large initial capacities of 1100 and 1084 mAh/g, retaining 490 and 410 mAh/g with 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 1.6 mA/cm2 with approximately 98 and 97 % Columbic efficiency (Fig. 3a-b). By stark contrast, the Li-S cell using the pure carbon cloth as the cathode catalyst exhibits an initial capacity of 450 mAh/g, retaining 407 mAh/g with 100 cycles at 1.6 mA/cm2 (Fig. S2g), which is consistent with previous studies on liquid Li-S cells using pure carbon materials as the polysulfide catalyst [47]. Another challenge for practical applications of Li-S batteries is to approach efficient battery performances with quick-acting cell running and high sulfur loading. The cycling performance of C-Sb2S3 cells was evaluated with an electrode area of 2 cm2 and a high sulfur loading of 5 mg/cm2 (Fig. 3c). When cycling at current densities of 1.6 and 3.2 mA/cm2, cells deliver capacities of 750 and 630 mAh/g and hold an average Columbic efficiency 98 % with 600 and 380 mAh/g after 200 cycles, respectively. With high sulfur loading and current density, C-Sb2S3 cells do not induce compromised cycling stability. Meanwhile, the overall mass of C-Sb2S3 cells are 3.80 and 3.83 g, respectively. When cycling at current densities of 1.6 and 3.2 mA/cm2 (Fig. S1l), those cells deliver energy density of 3.2 and 2.7 Wh/kg and hold an average Columbic efficiency 98% with 2.6 and 1.6 Wh/kg after 200 cycles, respectively. Also, the C-Sb2S3 cell is carried out by stepwise from 1.0 to 5.0 mA/cm2 for Li-S batteries (Fig. 3d). When the current rate increased stepwise from 1.0 to 2.0, to 3.0, to 4.0 and 5.0 mA/cm2, the corresponding capacities of 1170, 1100, 1035, 950 and 830 mAh/g are retained, respectively. More importantly, it should be noted that the C-Sb2S3 cell retains the capacity of 1120 mAh/g with a backward current density of 1.0 mA/cm2. Next, the corresponding charge/discharge data of the C-Sb2S3-based battery (the current rate from 1.0 to 5.0 mA/cm2) are given in Fig. 3(e). In the discharge stage, two plateaus demonstrate the reduction from S8 to polysulfides and later to Li2S2/Li2S. In the charge stage, the one plateau reveals the reaction from Li2S2/Li2S to S8. Morphologies of the initial electrode and recharged electrode are determined by SEM with elemental mapping images (Fig. S2a-f and Fig. S3a-b). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is adopted to investigate the kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Fig. 3(f) and Fig. S1(i) show the Nyquist plots of the C-Sb2S3-based cells after 100, 250, and 500 cycles, and its inset provides the equivalent circuit. The internal impedance (Rs), surface/charge-transfer resistance (Rp), constant phase element (CPE), and Warburgimpedance (W) referred to the high, middle, and low-frequency regions of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy [40,48,49]. The minor difference of semicircle plots indicates the good charge transport kinetics and electrolyte infiltration in the Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cell after 1, 250, and 500 cycles. As follows, the electrochemical behavior of Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cell is examined through the cyclic voltammetry (CV) with 1.5–2.8 V and 0.4 mV/s (scan rate). A staged scan rate from 0.1 to 1.0 mV/s is also considered. With a sweep speed of 0.4 mV/s (Fig. 3 g), two reduction peaks suggest the reduction of sulfur (S8) to high-order polysulfides, and then to Li2S2/Li2S. The one oxidation peak indicates the one-step reaction from Li2S2/Li2S to S8. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficient could be evaluated using the Randles-Sevcik equation: Ip = (2.69 × 105)n 3/2 AD 1/2 C Li v 1/2 [31,32,34,38,41,48,50]. In this equation, Ip is the peak current, n is the charge transfer number, A is the area of the active cathode, D is the lithium ions diffusion coefficient, C Li is the concentration of lithium ions in the cathode, and v is the sweep rate. The slight polarization of voltage could demonstrate the efficient redox reaction of polysulfides and electron transfer [31,32,34,38,41]. The CV peak currents increase by increasing the staged scan rate from 0.1 to 1.0 mV/s (Fig. 3h), which shows the linear dependence of the peak current on the square root of the scan rate and implies the ordered diffusion of Li+ for the electrochemical activity of C-Sb2S3 cells (Fig. 3i). Also, Sb2S3-based Li2S6 cell shows a similar electrochemical performance of Li+ (Fig. S1j-k). That is, the highly ordered and single-crystal Sb2S3 nanowires can facilitate the ordered diffusion of Li+ for the electrochemical activity of Li2S6 cells. To gain profound insights into the excellent cycling performance of C-Sb2S3, the symmetric cells (Fig. 4 a) are assembled by C-Sb2S3 with carbon cloth (C-Sb2S3-CC), pure Sb2S3 with carbon cloth (Sb2S3-CC), and carbon cloth (CC) with loading the same mass of Li2S6 in electrodes. As depicted in Fig. 4(b), the C-Sb2S3-CC cells with the Li2S6 electrolyte have four redox signal peaks, locating around −0.2 V to −0.06 V and further to 0.2 V and 0.06 V. The well-separated redox pair and notable peak intensity could offer the efficient transformation of polysulfides and gainful electrochemical reversibility [51]. Therefore, the multi-active-site catalyst C-Sb2S3-CC towards the conversion reactions of polysulfides may like a bifunctional catalyst, indicating that triple-phase interfaces of C-Sb2S3-CC would be beneficial for the polysulfide reduction (to Li2S2/Li2S) and oxidation (to sulfur) [4,23,42,51]. The EIS spectra (Fig. 4c) show the reaction semicircle of the symmetrical cells. C-Sb2S3-CC has a smaller diameter than the pure Sb2S3-CC cell, suggesting the graphene-like carbon clusters could improve the charge transfer resistance of the electrode interface [48]. The chronoamperometric curves (Fig. 4d) clearly show that the interfacial diffusion limitation phenomenon (C-Sb2S3-CC: 94.3 mA/cm2, Sb2S3-CC: 34.5 mA/cm2, and CC: 3.7 mA/cm2). The origin-containing straight line at the Cottrell curve (Fig. 4d) demonstrated that the C-Sb2S3-CC-based cell has a better current response than those of Sb2S3-CC-based and CC-based cells, implying a strong interplay between Li2S6 and triple-phase interfaces of C-Sb2S3-CC [52]. To examine the possibility of C-Sb2S3 as a cathode electrocatalyst for Li2S6-based Li-S cells, the in-situ XPS technology was used to analyze the triple-phase interfaces of interacted chemical bonds between carbon clusters, Sb2S3, and polysulfides [53–55]. The in-situ XPS spectra (Fig. 4e-h) present the interfacial chemical bonds in electrodes for two different cycles of C-Sb2S3-based Li-S batteries: one ran 10 times (10th) and the other ran 1000 times (1000th) under 1.6 mA/cm2 after the aged time. The S 2p has four characteristic peaks from 172-165 eV (Fig. 4e) which could be from the interfacial LiTFSI salt (linear formula: CF3SO2NLiSO2CF3, bis-trifluoromethane sulfonamidelithium salt) and chemical bonds of Sb-polysulfides. The LiTFSI salt peaks could be ascribed to sulfur-containing bonds (S-N, S=O…) and/or residual sulfur-containing molecules. The chemical bonds of Sb-polysulfides could be the interactions between polysulfides and Sb atoms on Sb2S3 surfaces, which are also found during 1000 cycles. These could offer available channels for redox electron migration and enhance redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides on triple-phase interfaces of C-Sb2S3, reducing the “shuttle effect” of Li-S cells [32,53,54]. Fig. 4(f) presents two characteristic adsorption peaks of C 1s around 286–282 eV. The CC-Li and C-Li binding may be the interactions between Li atoms of polysulfide and interfacial carbon atoms of carbon clusters [46,54], which are also found after 1000 cycles. Fig. 4(g) presents three characteristic peaks of Sb 3d 5/2 around 536–530 eV. Two broad peaks located at the high binding energy region could be attributed to the generation of Sb-sulfate and/or Sb-thiosulfate [17]. Meanwhile, the interaction between the polysulfides and C-Sb2S3 leads to a more significant peak shift compared with that for intrinsic C-Sb2S3 (Fig. 1b), indicating its higher chemical affinity to the polysulfides that favors a stronger confinement effect in the corresponding Li-S cells. The F 1s spectra (Fig. 4h) shows that peaks for LITFSI are undivided, which could be from the fluorinated cathode interface. The previous studies [46,53–55] reported that the fluorinated interface of cathodes could be beneficial for protecting the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in Li-S cells due to the uniformly distributed F-based species at the interface of cathodes. In what follows, the S 2p spectra (Fig. S3c-d) of in-situ XPS of Sb2S3-based and CC-based Li2S6 cells are considered as control groups. The S 2p spectra of CC-based Li-S cells have LiTFSI peaks which also could be ascribed to sulfur-containing bonds and/or residual sulfur-containing molecules. In the Sb2S3-based Li-S cells, the S 2p have LiTFSI and Sb-polysulfides peaks, which are consistent with C-Sb2S3-based electrodes. To deep understanding the interactive chemistry between polysulfides and C-Sb2S3, adsorption behaviors are investigated by employing density functional theory (DFT) and adopting the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [26–28,36,56–58]. The density of states (DOS) is computed to investigate the electronic properties. The pure Sb2S3 is a semiconductor (Fig. S4 and S5a). With introducing C atoms, the total DOS cross Fermi level (Fig. S5b), demonstrating the metal feature of the doping system, which would be beneficial to electron transfer. The partial DOS shows that DOS of C atom is around Fermi level, further improving the electrical conductivity of Sb2S3. Also, DFT calculations of polysulfides on the (200) surface of C-Sb2S3 indicate that the binding energies of the most stable configurations are −2.958, −2.833 and −5.379 eV for Li2S6 (Fig. 5 a-c), Li2S4 (Fig. 5d-f) and Li2S (Fig. 5g-i), respectively. In detail, polysulfides prefer to perpendicularly locate at channels composed by rows of sulfur atoms on the Sb2S3. Li atoms tend to interact with surrounding sulfur atoms, while the sulfur atoms of polysulfides prefer to be adsorbed on the neighboring Sb atoms. The increase of binding energy implies that the interactions between polysulfides and Sb2S3 become weaker with increasing the sulfur chains. Also, the binding energies of the most stable adsorption configurations of Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S on (200) surface of pristine Sb2S3 are −4.591 eV, −2.416 eV, and −2.254 eV (Fig. S6-S7), respectively. Compared with polysulfides adsorption on the (200) surface of pristine Sb2S3, the more negative binding energy (E b) indicates the stronger adsorption capability of C-Sb2S3. Other possible optimized configurations with corresponding binding energies of polysulfides adsorption on the (200) surface of C-Sb2S3 are shown in Fig. S8. Next, electron properties of Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S locating on C-Sb2S3 surfaces are examined through charge density difference and Bader charge [26–28,36,56–59]. Charge density different from the most stable structures of Li2S6 (Fig. 5b-c), Li2S4 (Fig. 5e-f), and Li2S (Fig. 5h-i) on the (200) surface of C-Sb2S3 are presented. Cyan regions mainly occur in Li-S species, especially around Li atoms, while yellow regions are mainly concentrated around S atoms in Sb2S3, implying that electrons are donated from polysulfides (mainly from Li atoms) to the substrate. In the Bader charge analysis, Li atoms of Sb2S3 with polysulfides lost approximately 0.860, 0.861, and 0.857 |e| per atom in Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S, respectively. Li atoms of C-Sb2S3 with polysulfides lost approximately 0.853, 0.861, and 0.852 |e| per atom in Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S, respectively, which are close to Li atoms of Sb2S3. S atoms of Sb2S3 with polysulfides gain approximately 0.201, 0.306, and 1.012 |e| per atom in Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S, respectively. S atoms of C-Sb2S3 with polysulfides gain approximately 0.197, 0.136 and 0.882 |e| per atom in Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S, respectively. C atoms of C-Sb2S3 with polysulfides gain approximately 1.156, 1.389 and 1.301 |e| in Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S, respectively. 4 Conclusions In summary, we demonstrated a facile strategy to tailor an efficient triple-phase interface of graphene-like carbon clusters on the Sb2S3 electrode for better performance of liquid Li2S6-based Li-S cells. The interface engineering for the designed structure not only enhances the confinement and conversion of polysulfides by abundant active sites on the highly ordered nanowires, but also establishes conductive centers for redox electron/ion transfer by interfacial carbon clusters. As a result, the battery with 2 mg/cm2 sulfur offers an initial capacity of 1084 mAh/g, and holds 410 mAh/g with 1000 cycles and 1.6 mA/cm2. It also shows 630 mAh/g at a high sulfur loading (5 mg/cm2), with an acceptable capacity loss after 200 cycles. This work inspires an ingenious insight for interface engineering of multiphase interfacial catalysis in the interacted phase transition-based multielectron redox reactions.

        "dc:description": "High performance of lithium-sulfur batteries have been dragged down by their shuttling behavior which is complicated multiphase transition-based 16-electron redox reactions of the S8/Li2S. In this article, the triple-phase interfaces of graphene-like carbon clusters on antimony trisulfide (C-Sb2S3) nanowires are tailored to design a multifunctional polysulfide host which can inhibit migration of polysulfides and accelerate conversion kinetics of redox electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from the triple-interface design of polysulfides/Sb2S3/carbon clusters, the C-Sb2S3 electrode not only anchors polysulfide migration by the synergistic effect of Sb, S, and C atoms as interfacial active sites, but also the graphene-like carbon clusters shorten the diffusion paths to further favor redox electron/ion transport through the liquid (electrolyte/polysulfide) and solid (Li2S/S8, carbon clusters, and Sb2S3)-based triple-phases. Therefore, these Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells possess high sulfur loading, excellent cycling stability, impressive specific capacity, and great rate capability. This work of interfacial engineering reveals insight for powering reaction kinetics in the complicated multistep catalysis reaction with multiphase evolution-based charge-transfer/non-transfer processes.",
