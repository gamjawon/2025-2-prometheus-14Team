Chemical Engineering and Process Development Division CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory Dr. Homi Bhabha Road Pune 411008 India Graphical abstract For over a decade, the structure, reactivity, and mechanism of graphene based photocatalysts have been of great interest for hydrogen (H2) generation. Several studies have been done on the edge side groups (ESGs) of graphene oxide (GO), but the basal plane groups (BPGs)-epoxide and hydroxide have acquired far less attention. This is because the GO layers are strongly held with van der waals forces as well as H-bonding which prevents the foreign body from entering inside the layers. To overcome these problems, this study presents the successful synthesis and application of four coordinated sandwiched (FCS) Cadmium (II) Organo Tetrakis-[1,2]-Oxathiin (CdOTOT) in rGO-CdS composite (A 3D sandwiched framework). Additionally, experimental outcomes have been further supported using density functional theory (DFT), which suggest that CdOTOT is more stable than its precursors as well as thermodynamically favourable. The CdOTOT shows high H2 production activity ∼ 67.5 mmol/g or 13.5 mmol/g/h in presence of 1 % Pt cocatalyst and sacrificial reagents (Na2S/Na2SO3). It is around 33 times higher than pristine CdS, and stable up to around 15 hrs without adding any cocatalyst. This mesmerising outcome is over with reported various CdS-rGO based photocatalysts. The higher activity was further explained through the proposed mechanism and observed low electronic work function of CdOTOT. This innovative and extendable (with other metals) approach provides a revolutionary impact on numerous cutting-edge research applications like photocatalysis, water splitting, solar cell, etc. Keywords Cadmium (II) Organo Tetrakis-[1,2]-Oxathiin (CdOTOT) Basal Plane Groups (BPGs) 3D sandwiched frameworks Hydrogen production Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Photocatalysts are a very demanding and sustainable source of energy production since they are the major attracting elements in the production of solar hydrogen (H2) from water [1–3]. Therefore, the design and fabrication of a photocatalyst are very important in various aspects, including high activity, stability, and low cost [4]. These characteristic features can be achieved by tuning the electronic work function (EWF) or band gap engineering of a composite structure [5]. Therefore, graphene-based sandwich structures have achieved a crucial interest in the tuning of these properties. Because it provides remarkable originality in atoms after being intercalated between the graphene layers [6]. The outstanding innovation at the atomic levels created a unique individuality in sandwiched molecular structure. This sandwiched molecular structure can be fabricated in graphene layers by various types of bonding interactions such as van der Waals, covalent, and coordination bonds [7–9]. This innovative design changes the properties of three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based composite structures, which are not only used for photocatalysts but also contribute to other important applications such as water splitting, batteries, energy storage, solar cells, etc. [10–17]. Even though the detailed study of graphene and graphene oxide (GO) based sandwiched structures were less extensively studied, few of them have enlightened the tailoring of sandwiched framework of layered carbon structure in which multiple metal atoms were intercalated between π-conjugated sp2 hybrid planes [18]. When the layered carbon structure of GO was converted into a sulphur-impregnated sandwiched sheet via polymerization of polypyrrole, it exhibited high performance for lithium sulfur battery [19]. The achieved atomic innovation in graphene-based sandwiched/composite structure can lead to surface reconstructions, and it can be observed as physical surface reconstruction (PSR) or chemical surface reconstruction (CSR) through the interaction of external atomic building blocks with graphene or GO sheets. Even though PSR has not always tuned the work function, but CSR certainly has been able to tune this and it shows the potential in the development of cutting-edge applications [5,20,21]. However, some reports have highlighted the surface modification of GO/rGO layers through epoxide ring-opening reactions (Fig. 1 a) [22,23]. But there has not been any discussion about its impact on the practical applications via tuning the electronic work function. Therefore, intercalation of CdS moiety between the GO layers has still been unheeded and is a very challenging task. Removal of ESGs is a complicated process as it depends on the oxidation level of GO and the solvent used in the synthesis procedure. Thus, the formation of the CdOTOT structure has become difficult due to (i) van der Waals interaction between the GO layers making it closely packed, thereby prohibiting the entry of foreign entity between the layers. (ii) Hydrogen bonding interaction between the BPGs in GO and the intercalated water molecules. (iii) Furthermore, the entire foreign moiety initially interacts with the ESGs of GO (protection of BPGs by the ESGs). Moreover, after a vigilant study about various types of GO, rGO, and CdS-based binary/ternary/quaternary photocatalysts (Table S3), we have noticed a general trend in the prior reports such as (i) un-utilization of the BPGs. (ii) interaction with the foreign entities is limited only on the surface of rGO. (iii) less stability. (iv) low hydrogen production activity and expensive photocatalysts. (v) lack of understanding about photocatalytic pathways occurring at GO/rGO and CdS interface (Table S3) [3,24–29]. Overcoming all these issues that obstruct the design of a stable rGO-based 3D sandwiched framework using intercalated CdS moiety; we have successfully incorporated the ‘CdOTOT’ structure between two rGO layers through the epoxide ring opening after complete removal of ESGs (Fig. 1 b). In addition, the experimental outcomes were supported by DFT (Fig. 1 c). This CdOTOT sandwiched framework shows excellent and enhanced hydrogen production activity of 67.5 mmol/g or 13.5 mmol/g/h in presence of 1 % Pt cocatalyst and sacrificial reagents (Na2S/Na2SO3). It is around 33 times higher than CdS alone. Furthermore, it is found that the CdOTOT frameworks were stable up to 15 hrs without adding any cocatalyst. Compared with previously reported CdS @ rGO-based photocatalysts, this work is very promising and delivers an excellent and enhanced H2 production. The higher activity shown by CdOTOT was elaborately explained through a proposed mechanism of “two-step photocatalytic pathway”. This novel concept of CdOTOT framework will provide a new way of thinking in graphene-metal semiconductor composite research, which may revolutionize numerous cutting-edge research applications like photocatalysis, water splitting, solar cell, etc. 2 Result and discussion 2.1 Removal of ESGs, which act as a barricade for 3D-sandwiched framework To understand the formation of ‘CdOTOT’ sandwiched structure between rGO layers, a schematic presentation is illustrated in Fig. S1. The path is shown in Fig. S1a, where the ESGs act as a barricade for polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cadmium acetate [Cd(OAc)2] to enter the layers. Therefore, a spacer moiety [PEG-Cd(OAc)2] was developed initially through the H-bonding interaction between PEG and Cd(OAc)2 (Fig. S1b). ESGs were removed by heating GO in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) at 120–145 °C (Fig. S2). Even though the van der Waals interacting forces played an important role in forming a sandwich structure with 2D graphene layers, synthesis of GO through acid treatment is still necessary to exfoliate graphite layers. The graphite exfoliation energy is 42.6 MeV due to the low interlayer spacing of graphite (d-spacing = 3.35 Å, Fig. S1c). When the temperature is increased for the GO solution, the H-bonding interaction vanishes, but van der Waals interaction still exists between the graphite layers (d-spacing = 8.15 Å, Fig. S1c). Here, it indicates that the H-bonding is not the main aspect of the interlayer’s spacing, but van der Waals forces were the main reason for the formation of a sandwich structure. When the spacer [PEG-Cd(OAc)2] was added to the rGO solution, it entered in between the rGO layers to decrease the van der Waals force interactions. This is due to the presence of similar oxygen functionalities in both the incoming moiety and the rGO layer, which repel each other to widen the gap between them for the formation of ‘CdOTOT’ structure through the nucleophilic attack. 2.2 Experimental cum theoretical study of CdOTOT 3D-framework Fig. 2 shows the confirmation of CdOTOT structure in the rGO-CdS 3D-sandwiched framework. Here, we have used a series of experimental characterization techniques such as Raman, FTIR, UV–Visible spectroscopy, Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Raman spectra show the new peaks were observed at 577 cm−1, 805 cm−1, 884.5 cm−1 and 1090 cm−1, which confirmed the CS, CSO, COS, and SO bonds of CdOTOT respectively (Fig. 2 a & Fig. S3 a). Incorporation of these bonds certainly changed the CC skeletal of rGO sheet. It is confirmed by tuning the D and G bands ratio and peak profile (Fig. S3 b-e). These bonds represent the [1,2]-oxathiin moiety at rGO surface which is also confirmed by FTIR spectra (Fig. 2 b & Fig. S3f) [30]. Simultaneously, these [1,2]-oxathiin bonding were established through the DFT calculated Raman, and FTIR spectra, and all experimentally observed peaks were well authenticated by theoretical prediction. Further, PXRD reveals that the (001) plane of GO shifted towards the lower angle (from 11.0° to 9.0°, Fig. 2 c) in rGO-CdS composite. This indicates increased interlayer space in rGO (from 8.0 Å to 9.81 Å). Likewise, the (002) plane also sifted at 19.3° (4.59 Å) from 25.7° (3.46 Å). Hence, the shifting of graphitic planes in rGO layers as a result of an increase in the interlayers d-spacing confirms the existence of CdOTOT in between the rGO layers (incorporation of new chemical bond entity, Fig. S4 a,b). This observation can be further verified by FE-SEM micrograph (Fig. 2 d,e) and TEM nano-graph (Fig. 4, Fig. S2,S4 c-h). This shows that rGO layers are well separated in NMP than water due to the elimination of ESGs and it is further verified by XPS spectrum of C1s core-level (Fig. 2 f). Additionally, analysis of fitted C1s and S2p core-levels spectra further confirmed that new chemical bonds (CS and SO) were observed at 290.0 eV, 163.9 eV, and 164.9 eV, respectively (Fig. 2 g,h). On the other hand, Cd3d spectra of CdOTOT show the shifting of peaks towards higher B.E. than new CdS, i.e., from 406.3 eV to 406.8 eV and from 413.0 eV to 413.5 eV which corroborates the Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 state respectively (Fig. 2 i) [30]. This shifting in B.E. confirmed the charge transfer in CdOTOT via LMCT and MLCT, and it led to a decrease in the bond order between Cd and S (covalent to coordination bond, detailed mechanism and process presented in Fig. S5,S6) [31]. Here, we noticed that spin–orbit coupling between S2p states decreases from 1.2 eV (in CdS) to 0.6 eV with low peak intensity. It might be due to two reasons (i) spin–orbit splitting decreases with nuclear shielding (for example, distance increase from the nucleus). Therefore, Cd shows more nuclear shielding than Zn, so, S2p1/2 peak observed at 163.3 eV instead of 164.0 eV (in CdS), (Fig. S7). The vast size variation between Cd (155 pm) and Zn (135 pm) and S electronic zone with Cd coordination in CdOTOT further creates the asymmetric nature in Cd-3d peaks [31]. Secondly, intensity is directly proportional to the number of atoms. So, Cd and S atoms are limited in CdOTOT as compared to free CdS and have only occupied the epoxide ring openings at the rGO network. Furthermore, the structural elucidation of CdOTOT is further confirmed through SS NMR analysis, and it is also verified by changing the metal precursors [CdCl2 and Cd(NO3)2] instead of Cd(OAc)2 (Fig. S8 & Scheme S1). 2.3 Anticipated reaction mechanism for the formation of CdOTOT The formation strategies of CdOTOT projected by the reaction mechanism have been shown in Fig. 3 . Firstly, the starting compound ‘GO’ was taken, and its ESGs were eliminated by heating at 120–145 °C in NMP to form rGO. Subsequently, prepared the spacer moiety [PEG-Cd(OAc)2] was through the H-bonding between Cd(OAc)2 and PEG in the same solvent (NMP) (see explanation in Fig. S9, S10). Further steps of the process have been listed below: Step-I (Addition of spacer): The interlayer distance between two rGO sheets are flared due to the integration of spacer moiety. The rGO layer holds numerous negatively charged oxygen and numerous oxygen occupied by spacer moiety; therefore, the layers repelled each other. Step-II (Nucleophilic attack): Repelling of similar charges oxygen functionalities widened the gap between the rGO layers. Hence, it creates room for nucleophiles (Na2S) to attack the epoxide ring. Step-III (Metalation): After the epoxide ring opening, the negatively charged S- ions can link with Cd2+ ions through a covalent bond. Since metal is electropositive, it can easily withdraw the electron from S. Therefore, S got partially positively charged and removed NaOAc and PEG further. This decreases the repulsion between the rGO layers, thereby decreasing the randomness of the overall structure. Step-IV (Ring-closing and metal coordination): Metalation step, in which Cd2+ ions can easily withdraw the electron from the 3p orbital of S in its 5p orbital via ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT). Here, Cd got a partial negative charge and S got a partial positive charge. Therefore, S can easily form a bond with negatively charged O, resulting in a four-member ring closing, thereby converting the covalent into a coordination bond between Cd and S through back electron transfer. This process is called metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) (discussed in XPS analysis, Fig. S5-S6). Step-V (Defect formation): Theory predicted that the sandwiched structure was stable on the defect site formed in graphene CC skeletal. So, there is a 1–3 hydride shift via bond breaking in the rGO layer, which led to the construction of line defect followed by dehydration. This further led to the enhanced conjugation in the rGO layer and assembly it as an overall stable sandwiched 3D framework [32,33]. 2.4 Morphology, structure optimization and bond order analysis of CdOTOT The 3D-sandwiched framework of CdOTOT has been analysed through the transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. 4 a-c). This clearly shows that the rGO layers were stacked on each other via a fixed separation and holding through the incorporated CdOTOT moiety between the layers. Interestingly, the exact information of inserted CdOTOT moiety, in particular, the graphene crystal plane, was identified by the zoomed-out region enclosed through blue and red dotted rectangular lines, which were represented in Fig. 4 b & d respectively. Consequently, the interlayer d-spacing were measured as 10.2 Å and 4.5 Å corresponds to [001] (shown by inset image of Fig. 4 b) and [002] (denoted in Fig. 4 e) planes of rGO respectively. This observation is further well supported by SAED pattern (inset image in Fig. 4 c), PXRD and theoretical analysis (Fig. S11). Here, all the elements (S, Cd, C and O) of CdOTOT structure were verified through high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and the scanned area of sample signposted in inset image of Fig. 4 e (Fig. 4 f-i), and it is further validated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. S12). To solve the idea of interleaved CdOTOT moiety in between rGO layers, the edges zipped-up, as illustrated in Fig. 4 c. This is further captured via high-resolution Tilted Angle HRTEM measurement (Fig. S13). This undoubtedly epitomizes that the rGO layers were separated by a fixed interlayer distance (10.0 to 13.0 Å), i.e., they were linked to each other through a CdOTOT moiety (separator moiety). To confirm this, the CdOTOT structure was successfully optimized between bilayers of graphene (CC skeletal) through DFT method, suggesting that CdOTOT is more stable than its precursors and thermodynamically favourable (Fig. S14 a-g & Table S1). 3 Investigation of H2 production 3.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation through solar water splitting Here, CdOTOT 3D sandwiched frameworks act as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen from photocatalytic water-splitting in presence of one sun condition (AM1.5). The photocatalytic water splitting experiment was carried out with and without cocatalyst in the presence of sacrificial reagent (Na2S/Na2SO3).[34] First, CdOTOT was treated without cocatalyst and each photocatalysts were used with sacrificial reagents Na2S/Na2SO3 for the first five hours to check out comparative study of H2 production. Fig. 5 a shows around 2000 µmol/g of H2 production corresponding to pristine CdS, while in CdOTOT, it was found 5800 µmol/g (string allowed in both photocatalysts). This significance improvement in H2 production activity confirmed the existence of tetrakis-[1,2]-oxathiin (TOT) moiety in 3D framework. It continuously produced H2 for around 15 h without using any cocatalyst (Fig. S14 h). Also, it was stable for up to 10 h (Fig. S14 i). Additionally, CdOTOT was also checked with cocatalyst (1 % Pt) for up to 5 h. It delivered high yield of H2 production activity (67.5 mmol/g), which is around 5.5 times higher than the without cocatalyst reaction (Fig. 5 b). Also, it was noticed that H2 production was lower when stirring allowed during the photocatalytic reaction. Stirring causes light scattering, which lowers the photon absorption and resulting in the lower hydrogen generation than without stirring (Fig. 5 b) [2]. Finally, the total enhancement in H2 production activity was observed around 33 times higher than pristine CdS. Further recyclability of CdOTOT in presence of Pt cocatalyst was measured (without stirring) up to 20 h in five cycles, in which 4 h was equal to one cycle (Fig. 5 c). Also, stable activity was detected even after 15 h. Even though there is a slight deterioration in activity after the second cycle of 8 h, in the succeeding cycles the activity is retained. It is comparatively better and more sustainable than previous literature reports (Table S3). Also, a controlled experiment was performed to investigate the difference between the mechanical mixing of GO with CdS and in-situ integration of GO, and we discovered lesser (2700 umol/g) hydrogen evolution was seen for 5 h. Therefore, this significant enhancement in H2 production activity shows the importance and crucial nature of CdOTOT in providing the pathways of electrons transfer, which lengthened the life time of charged carriers in 3D sandwiched framework. As we have noticed that our photocatalyst is stable for up to 10 h after which the activity starts decreasing (Fig. S14 h). This issue may be resolved in the future extended-work, where we can dope or incorporate it with some other metals or by forming binary/or ternary/or quaternary composite structures. In the present study, CdOTOT shows excellent performance as a single composite structure, making it an efficient photocatalytic candidate in terms of its structure, reactivity and mechanism having atomic level innovation which is cost effective and easy to synthesize. 3.2 Projected pathways for the photocatalytic H2 generation Li, Qin, et al synthesized CdS cluster decorated on rGO nanosheet in GO-CdS composite with same precursor Cd(OAc)2 (as used in CdOTOT) and checked the H2 production activity (1.12 mmol/h) in presence of Pt cocatalyst [35]. After careful investigation of the reported work, some tentative points regarding the mechanism were highlighted are found to be contrasting to this work. They claimed that after excitation of the semiconductor (CdS) part, electrons can further be transferred/moved in three different ways as illustrated in Fig. 5 d [35]. However, we tried to catch-out some un-ignorable facts of GO existence in composites (i) the presence of the sp3 hybrid site due to the existence of basal functionalities, (ii) charge accumulation on the sp3 hybrid site, and (iii) the presence of ESGs. These facts regarding the simultaneous distribution of electrons at various sites in composite network can decrease their availability to be utilized for hydrogen generation. We believe that these facts may affect the smooth movement of electrons in between the interface of rGO and CdS. Therefore, the formation of CdOTOT 3D sandwiched framework has been able to remove the above stated barricades (i, ii and iii) and has provided a facile and smooth pathway for the electron’s movements. This has further been confirmed via the transfer efficiency of photo-excited electrons shown in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of GO, CdS, and CdOTOT, which were observed at 325 nm light irradiation at room temperature (Fig. 5 e). Here, the pristine CdS and GO shows broad and small emission peaks centred at 385 nm (width range from 340 nm to 500 nm) and 365 nm (very narrow width) respectively. A significant improvement observed in the intensity of CdOTOT emission peak (around twofold than pristine CdS) and broadening with hypsochromic effect (red shift) can be observed. It helps to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron-holes pair in CdOTOT [25]. To provide a better understanding of the photocatalytic pathway of excited electrons in CdOTOT, anticipated mechanism has been demonstrated in Fig. 5 f. Here, we hypothesize that excited photocatalytic electrons of the semiconductor can enter in the CC skeleton of graphene sheet via path I, and then the CC cite of CdOTOT becomes saturated after a certain time [36]. So, electrons cannot further enter in CC network of rGO sheets but, they travel on Pt surface through the path II (Fig. 5 f) [34,37]. This electronic arrangement reduces the random distribution of excited electrons to increase their availability for the hydrogen generation, which also supported by PL time decay experiments (Fig. S15 a,b & Table S2) and it can be further understand via photocatalytic mechanism as shown in Fig. S15 c and Scheme S2. Optical band gap analysis of CdOTOT via experimental and theoretical methods are described in supporting information Fig. S16 a. Additionally, enhanced hydrogen production from CdOTOT was verified through the enormous generation of electrons as CdOTOT possess low EWF (ϕ = 2.98 eV) than pristine GO (ϕ = 3.9 eV) and CdS (ϕ = 3.3 eV), which has been determined through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 6 a-c). Hence, the low EWF value of CdOTOT was observed as a result of tuning CC skeletal in CdOTOT as compared to pristine GO and CdS (Fig. 6 d,e). The importance of CdOTOT 3D-framework was further verified by BET-surface area measurement (Fig. 6 f, Fig. S16 b-e, S17 and S18). Here, surface area decreases in CdOTOT than in pristine GO/rGO and CdS, which predicts that the surface area is not responsible for enhanced H2 generation. But it depends on local structural arrangement and surface modification. Additionally, a decrease in pore size diameter of CdOTOT (49.0 Å) than GO (53.0 Å) further suggests the Incorporation of CdS moiety between the rGO layers. 4 Summary and future scope of CdOTOT In conclusion, this work shows the facile synthesis strategy for forming novel photocatalyst ‘CdOTOT’ 3D sandwiched framework through incorporating CdS in between rGO layers. Further, the removal of GO’s ESGs (act as a barricade for forming a 3D-sandwiched framework) and the structural features of CdOTOT were verified by various experimental and theoretical (DFT) techniques. The proposed stepwise reaction mechanism has also explained the synthesis procedure. Thus, our experimental finding has additionally been supported via DFT calculations, which again provide the provision for existence of CdOTOT at the interface of metal sulfide semiconductor (M = Cd) and rGO sheet. The novel CdOTOT photocatalyst (possess lower EWF than pristine GO and CdS) further shows high hydrogen production activity as compared to its counterpart materials present in literature till date. We believe that this emerging concept of CdOTOT will give a new way of thinking in the research of graphene-metal semiconductor composites, which might lead to a revolution in a variety of cutting-edge research applications such as photocatalysis, water splitting, solar cells, and so on. 5 Experimental and theoretical methods 5.1 Synthesis procedure The CdOTOT was synthesized by using our previous work methodology of CdOBOT [30]. Take 1 % GO of Cd-acetate (wGO = 0.00533 g) and add 20 ml of NMP solution. This solution mixture was heated at 145 °C for 1.5–2 h to remove the edge side groups. Now, decrease the temperature of rGO solution from 145 to 90 °C. On the another hand, to prepared the spacer moiety, 20 ml of 0.1 M (0.533 g) Cd(CH3COO)2*2H2O was added in NMP. This solution was heated with constant stirring at 50–60 °C for 10 min followed by adding 6 % PEG (4000) (0.0319 g) of Cd-acetate. Now, further this solution mixture was stirred at 50–60 °C for about 1 h in inert atmosphere (Ar) to remove the O vacancies. Again, add the spacer solution [Cd-acetate-PEG] into the prepared rGO solution dropwise and leave this hybrid solution on stirring for next 1 h at 90 °C under Ar atmosphere. Simultaneously, prepared the nucleophile through 0.1 M, Na2S (W = 0.156 g) in 20 ml NMP, heated for 10 min and observed that Na2S didn’t solubilize in NMP. Therefore, we added 15 ml DI water in it and after few minutes whole Na2S was completely dissolved in solution (homogeneous phase of NMP + water) followed by Ar flow to create the inert atmosphere in order to remove the oxygen vacancies and kept it at 50–60 °C with constant stirring for next 1 h. After that, added the Na2S solution dropwise with the help of dropper in above prepared hybrid solution of rGO and spacer with constant stirring for 2 h at 90 °C. Here, it was noticed that in initial nucleophilic addition, the colour of solution was light yellow but later turned greenish due to charge transfer. After that the temperature of reaction vessel was reduced from 90 to 70 °C and maintained for the next 24 h with continuous stirring. Then, the reaction was stopped and washed out the compound followed by drying in vacuum oven at 70 °C for 10 h. 5.2 Washing procedure of the synthesized compound The washing procedure was performed as follows: (i) After 24 h of stirring, stopped the reaction and left it for cooling at room temperature, then collected the solution mixture from R.B. to 150 ml beaker by washing the R.B. walls with acetone to collect out all the remaining synthesized CdOTOT sandwiched compound from R.B., Now, the solution mixture was left in beaker for 6–8 h to settle down the compound. (ii) Decantation of the supernatant from R.B. was done leaving the product in R.B. with few ml of solvent mixture of blackish-brown colour. (iii) Now, poured 10 to 20 ml of acetone in this above remaining solution and kept it for 5–6 h to settle down the olive-green compound in R.B. and decanted the supernatant (blackish-brown colour). (iv) Again, poured 10 to 20 ml of acetone in the beaker, then left it for settling down and decant the supernatant. (v) Repeated this procedure 3–4 times until the blackish-brown color supernatant was removed entirely, leaving only the olive-green color compound settled down in the transparent acetone solution. (vi) Now, decant the transparent white solution from the beaker and keep the olive-green compound for drying in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 10 h. Then grinded the mixture of hybrid compound (Olive-green) in mortar pestle for further analysis. 5.3 Synthesis of other precursor materials Detailed synthesis of GO and CdS have been given in supporting information (see Section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively). 5.4 Theoretical calculations The proposed CdOTOT structure and its comparative materials were optimized by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These theoretical studies carried with the aid of Gaussian 09 [38]. B3LYP functional and 3-21G basis set were used for structure optimization along with that of metal coordination supported by LANL2DZ. Same parameters were used to study the spectroscopic vibrations such as Raman and Infra-red. As a result, each system underwent two computations studies (optimization and frequency calculations) [39].

        "dc:description": "For over a decade, the structure, reactivity, and mechanism of graphene based photocatalysts have been of great interest for hydrogen (H2) generation. Several studies have been done on the edge side groups (ESGs) of graphene oxide (GO), but the basal plane groups (BPGs)-epoxide and hydroxide have acquired far less attention. This is because the GO layers are strongly held with van der waals forces as well as H-bonding which prevents the foreign body from entering inside the layers. To overcome these problems, this study presents the successful synthesis and application of four coordinated sandwiched (FCS) Cadmium (II) Organo Tetrakis-[1,2]-Oxathiin (CdOTOT) in rGO-CdS composite (A 3D sandwiched framework). Additionally, experimental outcomes have been further supported using density functional theory (DFT), which suggest that CdOTOT is more stable than its precursors as well as thermodynamically favourable. The CdOTOT shows high H2 production activity ∼ 67.5 mmol/g or 13.5 mmol/g/h in presence of 1 % Pt cocatalyst and sacrificial reagents (Na2S/Na2SO3). It is around 33 times higher than pristine CdS, and stable up to around 15 hrs without adding any cocatalyst. This mesmerising outcome is over with reported various CdS-rGO based photocatalysts. The higher activity was further explained through the proposed mechanism and observed low electronic work function of CdOTOT. This innovative and extendable (with other metals) approach provides a revolutionary impact on numerous cutting-edge research applications like photocatalysis, water splitting, solar cell, etc.",
