Jao a, L.-J. Leu b, J.-R. Chang a,. Department of Chemical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi, Taiwan, ROC , Chinese Petroleum Corp., R.M.R.C. Chia-Yi, Taiwan, ROC Received 19 May 1995; revised 14 September 1995: accepted 14 September 1995 Abstract The performance of light naphtha isomerization catalysts is greatly influenced by catalyst prepa- ration and pretreatment, and optimal catalyst pretreatment conditions vary depending on feed prop- erties. Experimental results demonstrated that catalyst performance was determined by Pt dispersion when using pure feed, whereas it was determined by both Pt dispersion and Pt cluster stability for feed containing 500 ppm sulfur. Tested with pure feed nearly all catalyst samples fit a pattern which the isomerization selectivity increased with greater Pt dispersion. The only two exceptions, samples which gave unusually low conversion, have been due to pore mouth plugging which we infer from FFF-IR and XRD results. Highest Pt dispersion and, thus, best performance with pure feed was obtained with a catalyst prepared by the ion exchange and pretreated at a low temperature-ramping rate (0.5/min) during calcination and reduction. In addition, this catalyst was pretreated by cal- cination at 450, followed with reduction at 450. In contrast, the catalyst having the best perform- ance with feed containing 500 ppm sulfur was pretreated by calcination at 450, followed with reduction at 530; the superior performance may result from a compromise between metal dispersion and metal cluster stability.

Jao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301 316 olefins and aromatics (specifically benzene) content are also required to meet the specifications of new reformulated gasoline. Since these species are relatively high octane components of the gasoline pool, the impact of lowering the content of these species creates the need to change the operating conditions of some existing proc- esses or even invest in new processes for boosting octane. For instance, the reduction of aromatics content means that the reformer has to be run at less severe conditions, and processes such as fluidized bed catalytic cracking, aliphatic alkylation and paraffin isomerization are needed to compensate for the decreased octane in the naphtha reforming process [ 1-3]. Light naphtha isomerization converts n-pentane and n-hexane, having low octane numbers, to more highly branched isomers, which have higher octane numbers. The isomerization reactions are mildly exothermic and equilibrium limited. Low temperatures favor the formation of high octane branched isomers [4]. Friedel- Crafts catalysts, which allow the reaction to run at low temperature (80-100), may be suitable for the reaction. However, they are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, and highly corrosive to the equipment, which limits their application [4]. Two types of light naphtha isomerization catalysts, namely high activity chlor- ided alumina and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, are now used in commercial process [4 ]. High activity chlorided catalysts [Pt/A1203 (C1) ], similar to catalytic reform- ing catalysts, are prepared by impregnation or ion adsorption of platinum to a high- surface-area support, and the acidity of these types of catalysts is controlled by the addition of organic chloride. In contrast to bifunctional zeolite catalysts, they are relatively active, allowing us to operate at lower temperatures (normally at 130 to 170) and, thus, to obtain a product of a higher octane number. However, these catalysts are relatively sensitive to poisons such as water and sulfur compounds. Also, corrosion due to the injection of chloride into the feed, for maintaining activity, make equipment maintenance difficult. Bifunctional zeolite catalysts are operated at moderate temperature (250- 300). The octane number of the products of these catalysts is low, relative to those of high-activity chlorided catalysts, but the advantages of these catalysts are a lack of corrosion problems and decreased sensitivity to poisons; too high a sulfur content in the feed will still deteriorate the catalyst performance [5 ]. The goal of this research was to upgrade the efficiency of the light naphtha isomerization process by improving the catalyst performance. The influences of catalyst preparation and pretreatment on catalyst properties, and, thus, the catalytic performances were investigated. Catalysis of feed containing several hundred ppm sulfur, was also of interest because: (1) isomerization activity is decreased with sulfur bearing feeds regardless of the method of catalyst manufacture, (2) about half of the refineries worldwide do not hydrodesulfurize the n-pentane/n-hexane (C5/C6) fraction of the gasoline pool [3] and (3) little is known about the effects of catalyst pretreatment on the catalyst deactivation by sulfur poisoning. R.-M. Jao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 303 The test reaction was carried out at 400 psig and 240, similar to the conditions in commercial plants [4]. n-Hexane was used as a model compound to correlate isomerization selectivity with the metal dispersion of the catalysts and n-heptane was chosen as a feed to correlate fuel gas formation. Mordenite-supported Pt catalysts were prepared in this study because these catalysts are commonly used in the C5/C6 isomerization [4]. Thiophene was chosen as a model sulfur compound because (1) it is one of the sulfur species existing in light naphtha and (2) its catalytic chemistry has been fully investigated [ 6]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and catalyst preparation Mordenite zeolite (Zeolon-100, HM) was supplied by Norton Co. The zeolite (30 g) was treated with 300 ml of an aqueous solution of [Pt(NH3)4 C12 ] (Strem, used without purification) containing an amount of Pt that would have yielded a solid containing 0.6 wt.-%, provided that all the Pt had been taken up by zeolite. The pH of the solution was held at 8.0 by adding 1 M NH4OH and the zeolite slurry was stirred at 80 for 12 h to perform ion exchange. The sample was then filtered and the recovered solid was washed with distilled water and dried in air at room temperature for 8 h. The filtrate was mixed with the resulting solid and the slurry was stirred again. This ion exchange cycle was repeated 3 times and the resultant catalyst sample contained 0.42 wt.-% platinum (determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy with a Jarnell-Ash 1100 instrument). The impregnated catalyst samples were prepared by adding [Pt(NH3)4C12 ] to a water slurry ( 15 ml) of 10 g mordenite zeolite, followed by the evacuation of water under vacuum for 8 h at room temperature. The amounts were chosen so that adsorption of all the [Pt (NH3)4C12] by the zeolite would result in a solid containing 0.42 wt.-% Pt. All samples were calcined by heating to specified calcination temperatures rang- ing from 450 to 590 in flowing dry air at atmospheric pressure for 6 h. Two ramping rates (6 and 0.5/rain) were used in this study. Once calcined, the samples were purged with N2 at the same temperature before cooling to room temperature. 2.2. Catalytic performance tests The catalytic performance tests were carried out with a continuous downflow fixed-bed reactor. The reactor was a stainless steel tube with an inside diameter of 1.1 cm. It was heated electrically and the temperature controlled by a PID temper- ature controller with a sensor at the outer wall of the reactor. The temperature difference between the outer reactor wall and the center of the catalyst bed was 304 R.-M. Jao et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 about 10. The reactor was packed with 2.0 g of catalyst, particle size 1000-2000 /xm. The ratio of bed length to catalyst particle diameter was approximately 65; the axial dispersion effects should have been negligible. The upstream part of the reactor was a preheater zone filled with particles of a catalytically inactive ceramic material. The reaction system was first purged with dry nitrogen gas for 4 h to remove residual hydrocarbons. In general, catalysts were then reduced in flowing H2 at 29 atm for 6 h. To investigate the effects of pretreatment on catalytic performance, reduction temperatures ranging from 240 to 600 and two ramping rates (6 and 0.5/min) were used in this study. After reduction of the catalyst, the test catalytic reactions were carried out with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1.4 (g of feed/h g of catalyst) and H2 to hydrocarbon (C5, C6 and C7) mol ratio of 4.7, at 240, under 29 atm. Liquid products were trapped by a condenser at -5. Liquid samples and the product gas stream were collected periodically and analyzed by gas chromatography. Before the reaction the feeds, n-hexane and n-heptane (Aldrich), were dried with particles of activated 4 ,~ molecular sieve. Ninety-eight percent ( _+ 2%) of the feed was recovered as reaction products, as estimated by material balance calculations. The 2% loss is attributed to hydrocarbons deposited on the walls of the reaction system, on the catalyst and on the surface of the ceramic reactor packing. To investigate the effects of reduction temperature on catalytic performance with feed containing sulfur, thiophene was added to C6 to prepare the feed of 500 ppm sulfur content. To prevent any sulfur contamination, before reaction, the reaction system was purged with dried air for 8 h at 600. Catalyst samples were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 29 atm. The temperature was ramped from room temperature to the reduction temperature at 0.5/min and held at the reduction temperature for 6 h. Four reduction temperatures (240, 450, 530 and 600) were used in this study. After reduction, the temperature was lowered to the reaction temperature (240). The catalytic reactions were carried out with a WHSV of 2.5 and H2 to hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4.7, at 240, under 29 atm. The GC system used for feed and reacted sample analysis was a Shimadzu model GC-14B gas chromatograph equipped with a SGE fused silica capillary column of 50 m x 0.15 mm ID (50QC1.5/BP1 PONA) and FID detector. The column was operated at 35 for 15 min, then to 110 at 5/min with linear velocity 20 cm/ min dry nitrogen. 2.3. CO chemisorption A small amount of catalyst (about 1.0 g) was packed in a stainless steel tube and then reduced under the same operating conditions as those used in the catalytic performance test. After the reduction, the tube was then hooked up to a Shimadzu model GC-14B gas chromatograph with TCD detector. The tube for adsorption measurement was connected to a three-way ball valve and the connection ports were carefully purged with He before switching the gas flow to the catalyst bed to R.-M. Jao et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 305 inhibit any air contamination. After the system had become steady (20 ml/min He flow rate and 35), consecutive 0.1 ml pulses of CO were injected into the catalyst bed with He carrier gas until no gas of the pulse was chemisorbed. The amount of chemisorption was then calculated by summing up the proportions of all pulses consumed. 2.4. FFT-IR spectroscopy characterizing CO adsorbed on catalyst samples Infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterizing CO adsorbed on the cat- alysts was performed with a Shimadzu SSU-8000 instrument having a spectral resolution of 4 cm- J. The wafer samples were loaded into an IR cell which was designed to connect to a vacuum/gas-handling manifold for in situ treatment and then reduced at the same temperature as that for the catalytic performance test. After reduction, the sample was cooled to room temperature and CO (flowing at 50-100 ml/min at 1 atm) was introduced into the cell and maintained for about 20 min. After the CO treatment, the cell was evacuated to a pressure of approximately 10- 2 10- 3 Torr and IR spectra were recorded. 2.5. X-ray diffraction X-ray powder diffraction data were collected using a Siemens X-ray diffracto- meter model D5000 spectrometer with a Cu source (35 KV, 35 mA). All the catalyst samples characterized by X-ray diffraction were used catalysts; after cat- alytic performance tests, the reactor was purged with dry nitrogen at the reaction temperature for 2 h and then cooled at room temperature, the used catalysts were unloaded for X-ray diffraction measurement. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of Pt dispersion on the isomerization selectivity Mordenite itself has sufficient acid strength to isomerize alkane through a Frie- del-Crafts mechanism, in which the formation of carbeniums is an intermediate step. However, high temperatures required for the formation of carbeniums promote cracking reactions, and, thus, decrease isomerization selectivity. Since alkene skel- etal isomerizations are easier than isomerizations of the corresponding alkanes, the selectivity for isomerization can be greatly improved by the addition of a small amount of platinum dispersed throughout the mordenite base. The reaction mech- anism of these mordenite-supported Pt catalysts is bifunctional. In the reaction, acid sites are responsible for generating carbenium ions which undergo skeletal rearrangement, while metal sites establish alkane/alkene equilibration and limit deactivation of the catalysts [ 7,8 ]. Dispersion of platinum particles on mordenite 306 R.-M. Jao et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 and the resulting ratio of Pt sites to acid sites determines isomerization selectivity for light naphtha conversion. The influences of catalyst preparation methods, calcination temperatures and reduction temperatures on the platinum dispersion and the corresponding catalytic performance were summarized in Table 1. The correlation of Pt dispersion (CO/ Pt) with n-hexane (C6) conversion [ conversion ( mol-% ) = ( mol of n-C,, reacted ) / (mol of n-C, fed) X 100] and the isomerization selectivity [isomerization selec- tivity (mol-%)=(mol of Cn branched-isomer produced)/(mol of n-Cn reacted) X 100] is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively, and that for n-heptane (Cv) is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. Correlation results showed a trend toward increased C6 and C7 conversion and isomerization selectivity with increased Pt dispersion, consistent with similar results reported by Glannetto et al. [9], Ribeiro et al. [ 10] and Guisnet et al. [ 11 ]. However, unusually low isomerization selectivity and conversion were also observed at a CO/Pt of about 0.5 to 0.6. The reaction mechanism for these catalyst samples, which followed the correlation trend, was regarded to be bifunctional. According to Glannetto et al. [9], for a bifunctional catalyst that has an insufficient number or activity of its metallic sites for all the acid sites to be used, the higher the value of the metallic-to-acid-sites ratio, the higher the activity of the catalyst. The unusually low isomerization selectivity of the two catalyst samples may be explained by mass transfer limitation caused by pore mouth plugging, inferred from FFT-IR spectroscopy characterizing CO adsorbed on the Pt clusters of the catalyst samples. As shown in Fig. 5A and Fig. 5D, for the catalyst samples with CO/ Pt=0.72 and 0.38, only a single peak at 2060 (s) cm 1 was observed in the CO stretching region. This peak was assigned as the character of terminal adsorption CO on the Pt surface [ 12,13]. In contrast, two additional peaks at 2035 (sh) cm- and 2015 (sh) cm-' were observed for those two samples of unusually low isom- 1 erization selectivity. The two Vco absorption band peaks at 2035 and 2015 cm were assigned as terminal adsorption CO in which oxygen directly interacts with a cation (possible BrOnsted and Lewis acid sites) of the channel wall [ 12 ], as shown in Fig. 5B and Fig. 5C. Experimental results indicate that direct interaction of the oxygen atom of terminal CO with a cation of a support increases the adsorption energy and decreases the Uco stretching frequency [ 14-16]. These results are also in agreement with theoretical calculation [ 17]. Inferred from FFT-IR results, we might speculate that the interstice between platinum clusters and zeolite channel wall for those two samples having unusually low isomerization selectivity is smaller than that for the other catalyst samples, so that oxygen of CO adsorbed on Pt clusters can interact with cation of channel wall. As a consequence, due to mass transfer limitations caused by pore mouth plugging, lower C6 and Cv conversions were observed. As reported by Carvill et al. [7], for the conversion of C7 over mordenite supported Pt catalysts, catalyst samples reduced at 500, because they have dis- tinctly lower Pt dispersion (CO/Pt is about 0.6), are about twice as active as Table 1 Summary of the effects of catalyst preparation and pretreatment on catalytic performance and Pt dispersion Preparation Pretreatment Metal n-C6 method\" dispersion isomerization Calcination Reduction Temperature (CO/Pt) selectivity temperature temperature ramping rateb (mo1-%) () () C6 conversion (wt.-%) n-C7 isomerization selectivity (mol-%) C7 conversion (wt.-%) C7 fuel gas (wt.-%) 1 450 240 a 0.61 98.22 24.85 78.20 34.89 7.02 1 450 450 a 0.52 95.54 21.87 68.90 32.80 7.88 2 450 450 a 0.73 98.65 31.50 83.13 41.82 6.54 2 450 450 b 0.82 99.24 37.68 86.95 51.54 5.88 2 450 530 b 0.37 98.55 29.20 80.76 39.97 8.17 2 450 600 b 0.14 98.16 24.78 74.19 35.2 8.47 1 490 240 a 0.38 98.25 29.92 83.76 40.76 8.21 1 530 240 a 0.21 98.23 29.20 76.50 37.72 8.36 2 530 450 a 0.28 98.87 28.60 78.69 38.81 8.42 1 590 450 a 0.1 99.37 20.30 73.11 31.2 8.52 ( 1 ) Impregnation method; (2) ion exchange method. h (a) Temperature ramping rate = 6.0/rain; (b) temperature ramping rate =0.5/min. 308 R.-M.

This phenomenon was explained by the local destruction of the zeolite matrix that partially converts the one-dimensional pore system to three-dimensional, and, thus, removes the transport restrictions of diffusion and increases site accessibility; catalyst samples reduced at 500 produce Pt particles large enough to destroy the zeolite locally. Contrary to the results reported by Carvill et al. [7], in this study the catalyst samples of similar dispersion (CO/Pt is about 0.6) give unusually low conversions and there is no significant destruction R.-M.

The inconsistency of Carvill's and our results may be due to different metal loading on the catalysts; Pt loading for this study is 0.4 wt.-%, which is much lower than that on the catalyst sample prepared by Carvill et al. 3.2. Effects of Pt dispersion on the fuel gas formation of n-heptane conversion As shown in Fig. 7, fuel gas formation of C7 conversion over the mordenite- supported Pt catalysts is decreased with the increase of Pt dispersion.

For a catalyst with a lower metallic/acid sites ratio, the diffusion path of olefinic intermediate between two metallic sites is longer than that for a catalyst with more metallic sites. The possibility for the olefinic intermediate to encounter acid sites and to be cracked during its migration from one metallic site to another is also higher.

The catalyst samples having unusually low conversion also have higher hydro- cracking selectivity than any other catalyst samples does (Fig. 9). The higher hydrocracking selectivity may be caused by the hydrocracking of branched isomers which are trapped in the zeolite pore. For pore diameters on the order of the kinetic diameter of the reactants, the branched isomer products may be formed at active sites near the pore mouth; any branched isomers formed deep in the pore may further be cracked to smaller molecules (fuel gas). 3.3. Effects of catalyst preparation methods and calcination temperatures on the catalytic performance Effects of catalyst preparation and calcination on the isomerization selectivity and C6 and C7 conversion are summarized in Table 1. The data indicate: (1) the catalysts prepared by ion exchange have higher Pt dispersion and catalytic perform- ance than those prepared by impregnation; (2) Pt dispersion is only slightly influ- enced by calcination temperatures when they are lower than 450, whereas it is decreased at higher temperatures; and (3) the catalysts pretreated at a low temper- 0.4 ~- 0.3 x D ~ 0.2 .e 0.1 ~ ' ' ' 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.~ Dispersion, CO/Pt Fig. 9.

Jao et al./ Applied Catalysis A.\" General 135 (1996) 301 316 ature ramping rate have a higher Pt dispersion and catalytic performance than those pretreated at a high ramping rate. Platinum precursors, [Pt(NH3)4C12], can be introduced into the zeolite pores by either the impregnation or ion exchange method. Due to the complex nature of the chemistry involved in both methods and the resulting difficulty in characteri- zation, it is unclear why impregnation yields poorer performing catalysts than ion exchange does. However, we might speculate that the platinum precursors deposited outside zeolite channels and the lack of strong bonding between precursors and support play important roles in this performance disparity. Since, most of the aluminum sites of zeolites are inside the channels and platinum tetraamine cations can only be associated with aluminum sites, atomic dispersion of the Pt precursors inside the zeolite channels was expected with the ion exchange method; the few Pt precursors outside the channels after ion exchange would be purged during the wash step. In contrast, with impregnation, Pt precursors were expected to be randomly deposited in the zeolite and, thus, some of the Pt precursors would be outside the zeolite channels; this method includes no washing step. During calcination and/or reduction, any Pt precursors deposited outside zeolite channels may easily be agglomerated to form big Pt clusters and may induce the migration of Pt clusters from inside to outside the channels. Moreover, the Pt precursors deposited in the zeolite channels by impregnation are neutral and are more mobile than the Coulombically bound Pt precursors in ion exchanged catalyst samples [18]. The impregnated catalyst samples consequently have lower Pt dispersion than that of ion exchanged catalysts and thereby exhibit poorer catalytic performance. By calcination, a thermal treatment carried out in an oxidizing atmosphere, so as to decompose platinum tetraamine cations, platinum oxide is formed which strongly binds to supports [ 19] and thus leads to the formation of well-dispersed catalysts; the formation of mobile neutral [Pt(NH3)4H2] by a direct reduction leads to platinum agglomeration [20]. However, high-temperature calcination also pro- motes thermal migration of Pt clusters and, thus, induces sintering of Pt particles. In this study, we suggest that the calcination temperatures should not be higher than 500, consistent with the literature [21 ]. Based on our experimental results (Table 1), a low temperature-ramping rate was recommended for the preparation of catalysts with high Pt dispersion. 3.4. Effects of reduction temperature on catalytic performance with pure feed and feed containing 500 ppm sulfur The effects of reduction temperature on the metal dispersion and catalytic behav- ior of supported-metal catalysts have been investigated by many authors [22-25] and the results have indicated that both properties are adversely proportional to reduction temperature at temperatures higher than 500. For pure C6 and C7 feed, our experimental results (Fig. 10) are consistent with those reported in the litera- R.-M.

However, for the feed containing 500 ppm sulfur, the catalyst sample reduced at 530 has a lower initial activity than that of the catalyst sample reduced at 450, but has a higher stability maintenance (Fig. 11 ). These results, along with those of two studies by Vaarkamp et al. (the effects of sulfur on the catalyst structure and the related catalyst performance) [26] and Chiou et al. (the mechanism of Pt particle growth during sulfur poisoning) [ 27], lead us to believe that a catalyst of stable Pt clusters is crucial in resisting sulfur poisoning. 30 25~, zo( 15( lo b 5 0 ] ~ :][~ 0 0 O0 0 0 ~A A 00, O0 0 , 0 10 20 30 40 Time on stream, h Fig. 11.

Jao et al. /Applied Catal3'sis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 In investigating the metal-support interface in supported-metal catalysts by X- ray absorption spectroscopy, a metal-oxygen bond length of about the sum of the covalent radii of the metal and oxygen (about 2.1 A) is normally observed when the catalysts are reduced at a high temperature ( > 450). However, when the supported-metal catalysts are treated at a low temperature in H2 or are prepared under He with a partially hydroxylated support, a long metal-support oxygen bond distance (2.5-2.7 ~,) is observed. The longer distance has been suggested to be due to the interactions between metal and surface hydroxyl groups or interactions between metal and support oxide with a hydride presented at the interface between the metal and oxygen atoms [28,29]. These interactions are thermodynamically quite unstable. EXAFS results demonstrate that the adsorption of CO on metal clusters, or the evacuation of supported metal catalysts which present both the long and short bond distance, leads to removal of the long bond distance interactions, accompanied by a morphology change in the metal clusters, while short bond distance interactions are not changed [28,29]. Inferred from the EXAFS results, we may conclude that the stability of Pt clusters increases with higher reduction temperature. Thus, for the feed containing 500 ppm sulfur, the superior performance of the catalyst sample reduced at 530 may possibly be due to a compromise between metal dispersion and metal cluster stability; the catalyst reduced at 450 has highest metal dispersion but lowest cluster stability (of the 3 samples reduced above 300), while the catalyst reduced at 600 has the lowest dispersion and highest stability. Fuel gas formed from light naphtha catalyzed by mordenite-supported catalysts may come from bi-functional hydrocracking and by mona-functional Pt-catalyzed cracking [ 16,30 ] and the Pt-catalyzed cracking may be suppressed by sulfur [ 31 ]. The optimal reduction temperature may also be changed by this sulfur-suppression factor when the feed is changed from pure n-C6 to n-C6 containing 500 ppm sulfur. However, in this study, the fuel gas formed from n-C6 is less than 0.3 wt.-%. Therefore, the sulfur-suppression factor is regarded to be a minor factor for the change of the optimal reduction temperature. 4. Conclusions The effects of catalyst preparation and pretreatment on the metal dispersion of mordenite-supported Pt catalysts and the resulting catalyst performance were inves- tigated by examining CO chemisorption, isomerization selectivity and fuel gas formation of n-heptane (C7) hydrocracking. The correlation of C6 isomerization selectivity with metal dispersion indicated that the isomerization selectivity was increased with increased Pt dispersion, except with catalysts of moderate metal dispersion (CO/Pt is about 0.55), which have an unusual low isomerization selec- tivity. This unusual catalytic performance is thought to be a result of pore mouth plugging, inferred from FFT-IR spectroscopy characterizing CO chemisorbed on R.-M. Jao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 301-316 315 the Pt catalysts and XRD spectroscopy characterizing zeolite structure. The catalyst with the highest Pt dispersion was prepared by ion exchange. Before reaction, it was pretreated by calcination in flowing air at 450, followed by reduction in flowing H2 at 450. The temperature ramping rate is also important for the prep- aration of a high Pt-dispersion catalyst; the catalyst, heated at 0.5/min to the specified temperature, had a better dispersion than that heated at 6/min. More- over, catalyst pretreatment conditions affect not only Pt dispersion, but also the stability of Pt clusters, thereby affecting the catalyst performance during sulfur poisoning. For n-hexane feed containing 500 ppm sulfur, a catalyst reduced at 530 has the best stability maintenance. Since, the Pt dispersion of a thus-reduced catalyst is lower than that of a catalyst reduced at 450, the better stability main- tenance is thought to be due to the better Pt clusters stability.

(+886-5) 2721206 The performance of light naphtha isomerization catalysts is greatly influenced by catalyst preparation and pretreatment, and optimal ctalyst pretreatment conditions vary depending on feed properties. Experimental results demonstrated that catalyst performance was determined by Pt dispersion when using pure feed, whereas it was determined by both Pt dispersion and Pt cluster stability for feed containing 500 ppm sulfur. Tested with pure feed nearly all catalyst samples fit a pattern which the isomerization selectivity increased with greater Pt dispersion. The only two exceptions, samples which gave unusually low conversion, have been due to pore mouth plugging which we infer from FFT-IR and XRD results. Highest Pt dispersion and, thus, best performance with pure feed was obtained with a catalyst prepared by the ion exchange and pretreated at a low temperature-ramping rate (0.5°C/min) during calcination and reduction. In addition, this catalyst was pretreated by calcination at 450°C, followed with reduction at 450°C. In contrast, the catalyst having the best performance with feed containing 500 ppm sulfur was pretreated by calcination at 450°C, followed with reduction at 530°C; the superior performance may result from a compromise between metal dispersion and metal cluster stability.
