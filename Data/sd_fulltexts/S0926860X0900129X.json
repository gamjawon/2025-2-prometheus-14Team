Tel.: +82 28807409; fax: +82 28756697. The performance of Mo12Bi1.0Co4.4Fe1.0K0.07O x mixed metal-oxide catalysts, which were prepared from a sol–gel solution containing different amounts of pre-added ethylene glycol (EG), in the partial oxidation of propylene was investigated. Addition of EG decreased the catalytic activity, but increased the selectivity for the production of acrolein and acrylic acid, particularly when EG was added in an amount of 15mol%.

Graphical abstract The performance of Mo12Bi1.0Co4.4Fe1.0K0.07O x mixed metal-oxide catalysts, which were prepared from a sol–gel solution containing different amounts of pre-added ethylene glycol (EG), in the partial oxidation of propylene was investigated. Addition of EG decreased the catalytic activity, but increased the selectivity for the production of acrolein and acrylic acid, particularly when EG was added in an amount of 15mol%. Keywords Sol–gel process Ethylene glycol Propylene oxidation Acrylic acid 1 Introduction Multi-component metal oxides based on Mo and Bi [1,4] are used as catalysts for the partial oxidation of propylene to produce acrolein and acrylic acid. Catalyst properties are determined by several factors, including their composition, surface area, crystallinity, and surface acidity [5–14]. Mixed-oxide catalysts that are prepared by a co-precipitation method have relatively low activities due to their low surface areas, which are typically in the range of 8–10m2/g [1,15]. However, the surface area can be increased to about 10–12m2/g by using the Pechini method, which is a sol–gel process starting from a solution containing additives, such as ethylene glycol (EG) and citric acid [14,16,17]. Previous studies showed that Bi2Mo3O12, Bi2MoO6, and MoO3 crystalline phases, which were contained in Bi–Mo oxide catalysts for propylene oxidation, played an important role in determination of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts [18,19]. It was also reported that the relative amounts of crystalline phases in LiMn2O and TiO2-doped alumina, which were used as electrodes of lithium-ion batteries, could be changed by adjusting the amounts of EG and citric acid used in the Pechini process [20,21]. In this study, we attempted to optimize the properties of Mo–Bi–Co–Fe–K oxide catalysts for propylene oxidation by addition of the ideal amount of EG during the preparation of the catalysts by using the Pechini process. Results of reaction tests performed at atmospheric pressure using prepared catalysts were consistent with both the surface properties of the catalysts, which were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the temperature-programmed desorption of propylene (Propylene-TPD). 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Sample catalysts with an atomic ratio of Mo:Bi:Fe:Co:K=12:1:1:4.4:0.07 were prepared using the Pechini process, which is described in Fig. 1 . The following metal component precursors were used: ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, bismuth(β) nitrate penta-hydrate, cobalt(α) nitrate hexahydrate, iron(β) nitrate nanohydrate, and potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate was obtained from Shinyo Pure Chemicals and the other four precursors from Sigma–Aldrich. Solution I was prepared by dissolving 200g of Mo precursor and 115g of citric acid in 450ml of distilled water at 75°C. Solution II was made by dissolving 120.9g of Co precursor and 38.1g of Fe precursor in 50ml of distilled water. A mixture of Bi and K precursors was made by adding 45.8g of Bi precursor and 0.67g of K precursor to a nitric acid solution, which was obtained by adding 15ml of 70% nitric acid to 50ml of distilled water. Solution II and the mixture of Bi and K precursors were sequentially added to Solution I. Finally, EG was added to the mixture of Mo, Fe, Co, Bi, and K precursors [17] in the amounts corresponding to 5–25mol% of the amounts of citric acid. The final solution obtained from the above procedure formed a gel after heat-treatment at 110°C for 2.5h. Subsequently, the gel was dried at 180°C for 5h. Finally, the samples were ground in a mortar and calcined at 450°C in air for 5h [17]. 2.2 Reaction A reactant feed that consisted of propylene, oxygen, nitrogen and water at a molar ratio of 0.07, 0.13, 0.73 and 0.08, respectively, was introduced into a Pyrex reactor (ID=16mm) containing 0.6g of the catalyst at a space velocity of 940h−1. The reaction temperature was varied between 300 and 340°C. Product gases were heated to 220°C to prevent possible condensation or polymerization in the flowing lines. The feed and products were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (Young-Lin, M600D) equipped with two parallel columns (a capillary Alltech AT-1000 and a Supelco carboxen 1000). The selectivity of the catalyst was obtained by dividing the summed amounts of produced acrolein and acrylic acid by the amounts of converted propylene. 2.3 BET and XRD Surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics), after the catalysts were heat-treated in a vacuum at 200°C for 1h. XRD patterns were recorded with an M18XHF-SRA (MAC Science Co.) using Cu Kα radiation. The crystalline phases of the catalysts were identified based on the database of the Joint Committee on Power Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). 2.4 NH3-TPD, propylene-TPD, and pyridine-IR The numbers of both the surface acidic sites and the catalytic active sites for propylene oxidation were measured by the temperature-programmed desorption of either ammonia (NH3-TPD) or propylene (propylene-TPD). For the TPD experiments, sample catalysts were treated in He at 110°C for 1h before either NH3 or propylene was adsorbed on the catalysts at 20°C. The reason why the catalysts were treated at 110°C instead of 450°C, the final calcination temperature, was to prevent structural changes of the catalysts during the treatment. Weakly adsorbed gases were removed from the catalyst by flowing He into the reactor for 1h. Finally, the TPD peaks were obtained while the catalyst was heated from 20 to 600°C at a rate of 10°C/min. Mass spectrometry was used to monitor both desorbed NH3 at m/e =16 and propylene at m/e =41. The types of acidic sites in the catalysts were analyzed based on infrared spectra of the pyridine adsorbed on the catalysts (pyridine-IR). The sample catalyst was pressed into a 40-mgcm−1 self-supporting wafer, which was placed in a Pyrex IR cell [22]. The catalyst was pre-treated in N2 at 110°C for 1h, the cell was then evacuated to 5×10−4 Torr. Subsequently, the catalyst was exposed to 20Torr of pyridine, the cell was out-gassed, and pyridine-IR spectra were recorded with an FT-IR (Midac, M2000) instrument equipped with a DTGS detector. 3 Results 3.1 Reaction tests Prepared catalysts were designated as EG X, where X denotes the amount of added EG in mole percentages relative to the amounts of citric acid added to the solution. The catalyst prepared without addition of EG was designated as S(0). Propylene conversions obtained from the EG-modified catalysts were slightly lower than those from S(0), particularly when the amount of added EG was less than approximately 20mol%, as shown in Fig. 2a. Among the modified catalysts, EG 15 showed the lowest activity for propylene oxidation. Differences in the conversions among the catalysts decreased with an increase in the reaction temperature. Fig. 2b shows that the selectivity for acrolein and acylic acid was improved when the catalysts were prepared from the EG-supplemented solution. The distribution of individual products obtained at 320°C is given in Table 1 as a typical data set. Acrolein and acrylic acid were obtained as intermediates of the oxidation process and, therefore, their amounts decreased with an increase in the conversion. The insert in Fig. 2b shows the changes in selectivity with the amount of added EG at a fixed conversion of 93%. Among the catalysts, EG 15 showed the highest selectivity. Finally, Fig. 2c shows the yields obtained by multiplying the conversions (Fig. 2a) and the selectivities (Fig. 2b). EG 15 showed the highest yield at all reaction temperatures. 3.2 Crystalline phases and acidic sites The EG-modified catalysts and S(0) exhibited the same X-ray diffraction lines that were characteristic of α-FeMoO4, CoMoO4, MoO3, Bi2Mo3O12, Bi2MoO6, and Fe2O3, as shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows the intensities and ratios of peaks observed at 2θ =29.1 (Peak I) and 56.4° (Peak II), representing Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6, respectively [23]. The intensities of both peaks were lowest, but their ratios were highest, at EG amounts between 10 and 15mol%. The numbers of acidic sites, which were estimated from the intensities of NH3-TPD peak shown in Fig. 4 , decreased as the amounts of EG increased, as summarized in Table 2 . The numbers of acidic sites per surface area also decreased with the amount of EG, indicating that changes in the acidity were intrinsic to the catalyst properties. A reduction in the crystalline phases in the EG-added catalysts may be one reason for the changes. It is also likely that the acidic sites were affected by the EG residues that were present in the catalysts. In fact, the colour of the catalysts changed from bright ocher to dark brown after the EG addition. The amount of carbon residue in the catalysts, estimated from the temperature-programmed oxidation of the catalysts (Fig. 5 ), increased with the amount of added EG. The relative amounts of different acidic sites, i.e., Brönsted and Lewis sites that were identified by pyridine-IR (Fig. 6 ), remained nearly constant as indicated by the area ratios of B/(B + L) listed in Table 3 . 3.3 Propylene-TPD The amount of propylene adsorbed on the catalysts was estimated from the areas of propylene-TPD peaks, which were deconvoluted as shown in Fig. 7a, as a function of the amount of added EG. Previous studies suggested that the active sites of bismuth molybdates for propylene oxidation could be grouped into two types according to the strength of propylene adsorption on the sites [24,25]. Type I, which weakly adsorbs propylene and corresponds to Peak I in Fig. 7a, represents the active sites for the production of acrolein. Type II, represented by Peak II in Fig. 7a, strongly adsorbs propylene and is responsible for the production of acrylic acid, C–C scission, and the formation of carbon mono- and di-oxides [24,25]. The positions of both peaks shifted to lower temperatures with an increase in the amount of added EG, up to 15mol%, and then shifted back to higher temperatures with larger amounts of EG, as shown in Fig. 7b. The ratio of the peak intensities, i.e., Peak I/Peak II, changed showing a maximum for EG 15, which will be discussed in Section 4.2. 4 Discussion 4.1 Activity The reaction network of propylene oxidation consists of three main paths, as described in Fig. 8 [2,10,14,26]. Path I consists of the oxidation of the allylic species by reaction with molecular oxygen to produce allyl(hydro) peroxides and subsequent oxidation between allyl(hydro) peroxides and gaseous propylene to form propylene oxide [26]. Path II consists of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propylene to allylic species, by α-hydrogen abstraction, and the conversion of the allylic species to acrolein and acrylic acid, by the insertion of lattice oxygen in a redox mechanism. A step involved in the production of the allylic species from propylene by Path II is catalyzed by the acidic sites [3,9,10,27]. Path III consists of the formation of acetone and acetic acid from propylene, which is activated by strong Brönsted acidic sites [3,10]. Carbon mono- and di-oxides are also produced in the above paths by the full oxidation of reactants, such as acetone, acetic acid, acrolein and acrylic acid, which is accelerated on strong acidic sites [3,10,13]. As shown in Fig. 2a, the activities of EG-modified catalysts were lower than that of S(0) and showed a minimum for EG 15, which was consistent with the results of the propylene-TPD experiments (Fig. 7b) that also showed the smallest peak area for EG 15. It was reported previously that the amounts of propylene adsorbed on Mo–Bi–Co–Fe–K oxides were strongly affected by the amount of crystalline phase in the catalysts [1,18]. The XRD results obtained in this study (Fig. 3b) showed that the amounts of Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6 phases changed with the amount of added EG, in a manner similar to the changes in the activity and propylene-TPD. That is, the intensities of both XRD peaks were at the minimum when the amount of EG was between 10 and 15mol%. Accordingly, the above results strongly suggest that the activity of EG-supplemented catalysts was determined largely by the amounts of Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6 phases in the catalysts. The activity is also affected by the numbers of acidic sites in the catalyst [3]. In the present study, however, the numbers of acidic sites (Table 2) monotonously decreased with the amount of added EG, which is a trend somewhat different from one observed for the activity. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the contribution of the acidic sites to the overall activity was less than that of the crystalline phases in the present study. The amounts of desorbed propylene do not seem to be correlated with those of acidic sites represented by NH3-TPD because propylene was reported to be adsorbed not only on acidic sites but also on the molybdenum dioxo groups bridged to bismuth–oxygen groups, cationic centers of molybdenum oxides and bismuth oxides sites as well [28,29]. 4.2 Selectivity The catalyst selectivity for the production of acrolein and acrylic acid was improved by addition of EG because the numbers of acidic sites, particularly the strong ones, which are responsible for the production of undesired acetone, acetic acid, carbon mono- and di-oxides, was reduced in the EG-modified catalysts (Table 2). The other factor to be considered concerning the selectivity is the relative amounts of Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6 phases in the catalysts. It was reported previously that the selectivity of Bi x Mo y O z catalysts was maximized when the ratio between the two phases was equal to 3 because oxygen mobility, which is required for the redox mechanism involved in the partial oxidation, was facilitated under these conditions [18,19]. In the present study, the ratio of the two crystalline phases, represented by Peak I and Peak II in the XRD results (Fig. 3a), was the highest for EG 15 (Fig. 3b), which was the catalyst that showed a maximum selectivity. The results of propylene-TPD (Fig. 7b) showed that TPD peaks appeared at the lowest temperatures for EG 15, indicating that propylene was adsorbed most weakly on the catalyst. This result agrees with a previous report that the selectivity improved when the strength of propylene adsorption was reduced [9]. It is also noteworthy that, in Fig. 7b, the ratio of Peak I/Peak II was the maximum for EG 15. Because Peak I represents the active sites for a redox step involved in converting propylene to acrolein, whereas Peak II represents the sites required for further oxidation steps, the above results suggest that, in EG 15, the redox step was promoted to a greater extent than the other steps. The reason why the ratio of Peak I/Peak II in propylene TPD shows a maximum for EG 15 is not clear at the moment. However, analogous trends in the intensities and the ratio of Peak I and Peak II between the XRD (Fig. 3b) and propylene-TPD (Fig. 7b) results suggest that the two sets of results can be correlated with each other. In fact, Peak I of TPD is related to Peak I of XRD because the former represents the active sites for a redox step to convert propylene to acrolein [24,25] and the latter represents Bi2Mo3O12 phase that is known to be responsible for α-hydrogen abstraction in the redox step [30–32]. It was mentioned in the above that Bi2MoO6 phase, which is represented by Peak II of XRD and responsible for lattice oxygen transport due to its layered structure [33,34], makes a synergy effect on the redox step by combining with proper amounts of Bi2Mo3O12 phase. The synergy effect is expected to lower the adsorption strength of propylene on the catalyst, leading to an increase in the relative intensity of Peak I over Peak II in propylene TPD. 5 Conclusions The activity of Mo–Bi–Co–Fe–K oxide catalysts, prepared by the Pechini process, for propylene oxidation decreased when EG was added to a sol–gel solution in the preparation step, particularly in an amount smaller than 20mol%. This result was obtained because the amounts of crystalline Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6, which contributed to the activity, decreased in the EG-added catalysts. However, the selectivity of the catalysts for acrolein and acrylic acid was promoted by addition of EG due to two major factors: a decrease in the number of acidic sites and a synergy between crystalline Bi2Mo3O12 and Bi2MoO6 in the catalysts. In particular, EG 15, which was prepared from a solution containing 15mol% of added EG, showed the highest yield for acrolein and acrylic acid at all reaction temperatures of this study.
