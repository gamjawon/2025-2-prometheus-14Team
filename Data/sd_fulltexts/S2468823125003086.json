One of the key issues hinders large-scale commercial application of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells is the unsatisfactory performance of the Pt cathodic electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The generally accepted solution is to alloy Pt with transitional metals at high temperatures. These catalysts are commonly prepared through high temperature annealing followed by de-alloying in acidic electrolytes. This work focuses on the effects of acid de-alloying on the structure of the Pt2Co/C catalysts and correlates with their activity and stability for ORR. It is found that the overall performance of the Pt2Co/C is greatly affected by the acid treatment temperatures (40, 60 and 80 °C). When the Pt2Co/C is treated at 40 °C in HNO3, the Pt2Co/C-40 displays the highest activity and stability, which is double-confirmed both by half-cell (rotating disk electrode) and single cell (membrane electrode assembly) evaluations. The catalyst treated under this condition reveals an alloyed structure with 3–4 Pt atomic layers and an optimal particle size of 4.8 nm. Meanwhile, the performance enhancement is possibly also aided by the introduced N-sources during synthesis. This synthesis offers an easier and scalable manner to produce Pt-alloyed catalyst with enhanced activity and stability.

As a substitute of fossil fuel, hydrogen is considered as a clean and efficient renewable energy resource and is highly expected to address the above-mentioned concerns. In support of the global oil use in transportation sector, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) operated on hydrogen are considered as replacements for internal combustion engines. Amazingly, they are capable of rapid start-up, demonstrate high energy conversion efficiency and can operate at low temperatures. However, the pros and cons of the PEMFCs must be weighed up before they find wide commercial applications. The performance and cost of a PEMFC must be comparable to the gasoline vehicle in order for its penetration into transportation market. Unfortunately, the widely-used Pt catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) poses a great limitation to PEMFCs since they suffer for high cost, low stability and catalytic efficiency [4,5]. So far, ORR catalysts other than Pt or Pt-based ones have not found successful commercial application in PEMFCs. Commercially available ORR catalysts in PEMFCs, without any exception, are either Pt/C or Pt alloyed/C catalysts. In order to reduce the dependence on platinum catalysts in ORR so as to reduce cost without sacrificing fuel cell performance and stability, strategies of various kinds have been proposed in platinum-based catalyst preparation [6]. One of the approaches that has been proven effective is alloying, i.e., platinum is alloyed (partially or fully) with other metals such as Fe [7–10], Co [11–15], Ni [16–19], Cu [20–23], etc. It has been reported that Pt alloying with other metals could modify its electronic structure [24–26], resulting in optimized ORR catalytic activity and stability and simultaneously reducing its usage. Amongst different types of the Pt-based alloys, platinum-cobalt alloys were extensively investigated and were successfully applied in commercially available PEMFC vehicles such as Toyota Mirai. It was reported that they displayed unique electronic and geometric effects in favor of ORR [27–30]. Many approaches have been reported to prepare PtCo alloys, such as co-precipitation [31], sol-gel [32,33] and electrodeposition [34]. Although these methods were proven to be effective, PtCo alloys synthesized via these means displayed relatively poor particle size distribution, leading to unsatisfied catalytic performance and stability. Except for the above-mentioned methods, dealloying the pre-formed PtCo in acidic electrolyte would selectively remove unwanted components, such as non-alloyed iron, cobalt or nickel. The dealloying process also creates porous structures with high specific surface area and produces abundant active sites, offering new opportunities for the preparation of highly-performed PtCo alloy catalysts [35,36]. Through dealloying, the composition and morphology of the catalyst could be precisely controlled, resulting in possibly enhanced catalytic activity and stability [37]. For example, Andreas Glüsen [38] de-alloyed core-shell catalysts by treating PtNi in 0.5 M sulfuric acid for 24 h at 70 °C. A pronounced Pt-rich shell with a thickness of 0.7 nm was formed, which is approximately three layers of Pt atoms. Dong Chen [35] reported an acetic acid-assisted strategy to de-alloy the outer surface layer from CuPd nanoparticles for efficient oxygen reduction and ethanol oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. Acetic acid leaching of copper atoms exerted additional compressive strain effects on the surface layer and exposed more active palladium atoms. In particular, the catalytic activity for ORR after acetic acid dealloying was much better than that of commercial Pd/C, Pt/C catalysts and de-alloyed samples under other conditions. This study aims to prepare highly-performed PtCo alloy catalysts using acid dealloying and systematically investigate different experimental conditions on the catalytic performance. In doing so, Pt/C was wet-impregnated with cobalt precursors followed by in-situ freezing. The as-prepared composites were then freeze-dried, ball-milled and were then subjected to high-temperature annealing. The annealed powders were de-alloyed in acidic electrolyte (HNO3) to remove unwanted species, resulting in a series of PtCo catalysts with different compositions. In particular, this study explored the correlations between the catalyst’ composition/structure and catalytic performance. For the first time, it was found that the catalyst pore structure and density of surface active sites could be effectively tuned simply by adjusting the acid treatment temperature, leading to significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials A Pt/C (50 wt. %) used for the experiment was obtained from Hua-hydro New Energy (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd., (hereinafter referred to the initial-Pt/C). Main chemicals are analytical grade, they are cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O), ammonia (NH3⋅H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, 68 %). Commercial Pt/C catalyst (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan, herein-after referred to Comm-Pt/C) was used as a benchmark. De-ionized water was produced using an ultrapure water system with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm-1. 2.2 Synthesis of Pt2Co/C@X Pt2Co/C catalyst was synthesized via wet-impregnation followed by in-situ liquid nitrogen freezing. To be specific, 300.0 mg initial-Pt/C and 91.5 mg Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O were well-dispersed/dissolved by an appropriate amount of deionized water in a beaker. 700 µL 0.3 M ammonia was added dropwise to the beaker under vigorous ultrasonic vibration for 0.5 h in an icy cold bath. Then, 1 mL 0.5 M NaOH solution was added dropwise and the entire mixed ink was frozen instantly by pouring on a large quantity of liquid nitrogen. After freeze-drying, the fully ground sample was heated to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C min-1 and maintained for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. It was then heated to 600 °C at the same rate under reductive atmosphere (N2:H2=8:2) and maintained for 4 h. Following this, it was cooled to room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere and the sample prepared by this manner was named as Pt2Co/C. Finally, the Pt2Co/C sample was leached with 0.5 M HNO3 at temperature=X (X = 40, 60 and 80 °C) for 3 h and washed with copious amount of deionized water, filtered and vacuum-dried. The finally obtained catalyst was denoted as Pt2Co/C@X. The synthesis schematic is shown in Fig. S1. 2.3 Physical characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained under Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA from 10° to 90° Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using JEM-2100F operated at 200 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were performed on a JEOL F200 FETEM operated at 200 kV. The specific composition of the catalyst was determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a LAB 250 ESCA system (Thermo Kalpha) with an Al Kα radiation source (energy=1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated based on C1s graphic peak at 284.8 eV. Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out using a Thermo DXRxi Raman spectrometer with a laser wavelength of 633 nm. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements by rotating disk electrode 1.0 mL water, 4.0 mL isopropanol and 25 μL Nafion solution were mixed with 5 mg catalyst and sonicated for 0.5 h to form dispersed ink. Subsequently, 8 μL ink solution was pipetted onto a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and dried at room temperature to form a uniform catalyst layer. Electrochemical tests were performed using a standard three-electrode system with an Autolab PGSTAT302N. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 5 mm casted with catalyst ink, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum wire mesh was chosen for the counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in N2 purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1 in the potential window from 0.05 to 1.10 V (relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). For the evaluation of ORR performance, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was performed in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at 1600 r.p.m and a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 over a potential range from 0.15 V to 1.05 V. In addition, the accelerated durability test (ADT) was performed under the same conditions, i.e., 5k, 15k, and 30k potential cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 from 0.60 to 1.00 V, respectively. 2.5 Single cell evaluation of the cathode catalyst by membrane electrode assembly (MEA) The anode catalyst used was commercial Pt/C (20 wt. %). The metal loadings at the anode and cathode were 0.08 and 0.35 mg cm-2, respectively, which are the most often used in practical application. In order to achieve the best accuracy, the active surface area of MEA was kept to be 25 cm2 (5cm*5 cm) instead of the lab-scale 6.25 cm2 (2.5cm*2.5 cm) (Fig. S2). The cathode catalyst ink was homogeneously mixed with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and Nafion solution under ultrasonication in an icy cold-water bath. In the ink formation, the ionomer/catalyst ratio (either Pt2Co/C@40 or Comm-Pt/C as a benchmark) was kept to be 0.8. The gas diffusion layer was sandwiched between the catalytic layer of the cathode and anode, and the MEA was fabricated by applying a pressure of 0.5 kPa at room temperature. The measurements were performed using a Fuel Cell Testing System (NBT Instruments, FT-100 W, Ningbo, China). The single cell test was carried out at a test temperature of 80 °C and a back pressure of 150 kPa using H2 as fuel and air as oxidant gas. Hydrogen and air were supplied to the anode and cathode with 100 % relative humidity. The flow rates of hydrogen and air were 100 mL min-1 and 400 mL min-1, respectively. For the durability test, a square wave cycle consisting of a step between 0.6 V (3 s) and 0.95 V (3 s) was repeated up to 30k cycles and the I-V curves were measured before and after the durability test to assess performance changes. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characteristics of the catalysts In order to find out an optimal Pt/Co initial feeding ratio and annealing temperature, we carried out a series of screening experiments. The Pt/Co ratio was varied from 1:1 to 3:1 and the annealing temperature was from 500 to 650 °C with 50 °C as an interval. The XRD spectra in the Fig. S3 compared PtCo catalysts synthesized at different Pt/C and Co(NO3)2 feeding ratios (Pt/Co=1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) and annealing temperatures (500, 550, 600 and 650 °C). Compared with Pt-alone catalyst, all the PtCo catalysts’ diffraction peaks, no matter what Pt/Co feeding ratios, were shifted to higher angles, indicating that Co has been successfully incorporated into the Pt lattice during the annealing process [39]. Meanwhile, their intensity also increases with an increase in the temperature. This could be easily understood and expected since high temperature aided in cobalt incorporation and resulted in particle agglomeration simultaneously. Furthermore, as the annealing temperature increases, diffraction peak ascribed to (110) appears at around 34°, indicating a phase transition from disordered to ordered structure. It was found that the highest mass activity was obtained at a feeding ratio of 2:1 and a thermal annealing temperature of 600 °C (Fig. S3d). Therefore, this synthesis condition was set unchanged in this work thereafter. Acid leaching of the catalyst at different temperatures were carried out and their XRD patterns (Pt2Co/C@X) together with the initial-Pt/C are shown in Fig. 1a . Diffraction peaks located at 23.8, 33.2, 40.8, 47.3, 69.3 and 83.5° for the Pt2Co/C@80 were corresponded to (100), (110), (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, respectively, indicating a typical face-centered cubic structure. Compared with the PDF standard cards (Pt#04–0802 and Pt3Co#29–0499), the diffraction peaks of the catalysts displayed more or less angular shifts. The lattices of the Pt2Co/C@40, Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 were calculated according to the Scherrer equation [40]. It was found that they increased gradually with temperature together with the decreased lattice compressive strain (2.80 %, 2.54 % and 2.04 %, respectively), as was shown in Table 1 . This infers that the Co doping shortens the Pt-Pt distance [41]. The greater the strain, the stronger the interaction between Co and Pt, which weakens the affinity to oxygen and enhances ORR catalytic activity [42]. The compression strain decreases with an increase of leaching temperature, which is probably due to the Co segregation under higher temperature leaching in HNO3 caused by dissolution of more in-depth Co atoms. Compared to the pure Pt (111) plane, the interplanar spacing of the Pt2Co/C@40 is 0.221 nm (Fig. 1b), indicating the presence of compressive strain. Lattice defects were also observed in the HRTEM image, possibly due to the surface Co leaching leading to re-arrangement and roughening of the surface Pt atoms, consequently, increasing the number of active sites. The SAED pattern of the Pt2Co/C@40 showed distinguished diffraction rings corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311) (Fig. 1c). As was shown in the Fig. 2 a-c, after acid leaching, the average crystallite size of the Pt2Co/C@40, Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 was 4.8, 5.1 and 5.4 nm, respectively. The particle size increases with an increase in the acid leaching temperature, possibly due to the particle agglomeration at higher temperatures. As was shown in the Fig. S4, the Pt2Co/@40 catalyst was uniformly distributed on the carbon support on a whole without any obvious agglomeration. The BET surface area of the Pt2Co/C@40, Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 is measured to be 308.7, 298.1 and 284.0 m² g⁻¹, respectively. The specific surface area decreases gradually as the acid leaching temperature increases, which is consistent with the aforementioned results. The as-prepared Pt2Co/C catalyst was treated via nitric acid to remove possibly isolated cobalt oxides, un-alloyed species and other acid-etched species. The elemental distribution map of the Pt2Co/C@40 catalyst shows an uniform presence of Pt, Co and N over the entire catalyst (Fig. S7 a). The introduction of cobalt-ammonia complexes during thermal annealing may explain the incorporation of N. The decomposition of the cobalt-ammonia complexes at high temperature may generate NH3 and result in N-doping into the catalyst. The elemental line scans for an individual particle were shown in Fig. 2d It can be found that the catalyst outer layer was covered by 3–4 atomic layers of Pt. By comparing the normalized intensity of Pt and Co, it is evident that the catalyst displayed a typical Pt-enriched surface/PtCo alloyed inner structure, in another word, Pt-rich shell-core structure [43]. According to the literature report [38], Pt shell with an appropriate thickness would not only enhance the Pt utilization efficiency, but also prevent the PtCo core from leaching during PEMFC operation. This structure may infer to excellent catalytic activity and durability. N was mainly located in the inner layer of the particles, suggesting the formation of Co-N bonds. It has been reported that N doping could further regulate the binding property of intermediates via the pinning effect on the coordinated metals [44,45], thereby enhancing ORR activity. Moreover, the chemically stable Co-N bonds could prevent the migration of Co atoms to the outer Pt shell [46] and suppress the dissolution of the Pt shell, consequently, improving the catalyst durability. From the EDS spectrum in Fig. 2e, it can be found that the atomic Pt/Co ratio was approximately 2.55:1. XPS was obtained to gain a more in-depth understanding of the electronic structure. Pt 4f spectrum of the Pt2Co/C@40 shows two distinguished peaks at 72.1 eV and 75.3 eV (Fig. 3 a), corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, respectively. Deconvolution of this spectrum revealed four peaks, which was at 71.9 eV and 75.2 eV for Pt0 and at 72.8 eV and 75.8 eV for Pt2+ [47], respectively. Compared to the binding energy of pure Pt (70.9 eV), Pt0 4f7/2 peak for the Pt2Co/C@40 had a positive shift of 1.2 eV, which was attributed to the downshift of the d-band center due to alloying [48]. Co in the particle modulated the Pt electronic structure, thus weakening the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates [49]. The Pt0 4f7/2 binding energies for the Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 are at 71.7 eV and 71.6 eV, respectively, which decreased with an increase in acid leaching temperature. As was mentioned previously, high leaching temperature leads to more Co dispatch from the bulk. Thickened outer Pt shell weakens the modulation of the surface Pt electronic structure, leading to higher d-band center in the Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 compared to Pt2Co/C@40. From the integrated Pt 4f peak area, it can be found that Pt2Co/C@40 was dominated with Pt0 on the surface. The deconvolution of the Co 2p peak for the Pt2Co/C@40 shows metallic states of Co 2p3/2 at 780.1 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 795.0 eV and oxidized state of Co 2p3/2 at 782.5 eV and 2p1/2 at797.7 eV, together with satellite peaks at 787.0 eV and 802.6 eV (Fig. 3b). Compared with the reported datum (Co0 2p1/2: 793.7 eV [50]), there is a positive shift of 1.3 eV after acid leaching. As for the Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 catalyst, the Co0 2p1/2 peak is located at 794.7 eV and 794.5 eV, respectively, with a less slight decrease in binding energy at higher temperatures. Raman spectroscopy reveals the degree of surface defects in the catalyst. In the Fig. S5, Raman spectra of all the Initial-Pt/C, Pt2Co/C@40, Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 catalysts exhibited featured carbon-supported catalyst peaks at 1340 cm⁻¹ (D peak) and 1595 cm⁻¹ (G peak) in which D peak reflects the defect structure of carbon, whereas G peak infers to the extent of graphitization. ID/IG ratio represents the defect of graphite planes, the higher it is, the more structural defects and disorder in the material. The calculated ID/IG is 1.8, 1.6 and 1.5 for the catalyst acid-leached at 40, 60 and 80 °C, respectively, indicating that higher HNO3 leaching temperature results in fewer structural defects. When the catalyst was acid-treated at 40 °C, the carbon support displays rich structural defects, which is favorable for the uniform dispersion of alloy particles and promotes better contact between O2 and the catalyst [51]. 3.2 ORR electrocatalytic performance evaluated by RDE Before performance test, the catalysts were scanned 20 times by cyclic voltammetry (CV) spanning from 0.05–1.10 V to activate the samples and remove possible surface impurities, allowing the active sites to be fully exposed. CVs for the catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 a. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated by integrating the hydrogen adsorption area in the 0.05–0.40 V (Fig. 4b) [52], which decreases in the order Comm-Pt/C (75.9 m² gPt⁻¹) > Initial-Pt/C (63.2 m² gPt⁻¹) > Pt2Co/C@40 (44.7 m² gPt⁻¹) > Pt2Co/C@60 (42.3 m² gPt⁻¹) > Pt2Co/C@80 (40.1 m² gPt⁻¹). ECSA of the Pt-alloyed catalyst is smaller than that of the Initial-Pt/C since its particle size increases more or less after thermal annealing\\acid leaching. Compared with the pronounced Hupd peaks from 0–0.4 V, all the Pt-alloyed catalysts displayed un-defined Hupd region. The calculated ECSA value agrees well with the particle size (TEM or XRD crystalline size), i.e., smaller particle display higher ECSA. It is to be noted that the reduction peak of OHad in the Pt2Co/C@40 shifted positively by 27 mV compared to Initial-Pt/C, indicating that the alloy catalyst inhibited the formation of Pt-OHad during ORR. Following CV tests, ORR activity was tested in 0.1 M HClO4 solution saturated with O2. All the Pt-alloyed catalysts displayed better performance in the mix kinetic-diffusion region (0.70–1.05 V) than Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 4c) and the half-wave potential of the alloyed catalysts is significantly higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst. The half-wave potential of the Pt2Co/C@40 was 0.919 V, which is a positive shift of 33 mV compared to the Initial-Pt/C, indicating a significant improvement in ORR activity. The mass activities (MA) of the catalysts calculated by formula S4 were Comm-Pt/C (0.18 A mgPt⁻¹), Initial-Pt/C (0.20 A mgPt⁻¹), Pt2Co/C@40 (0.59 A mgPt⁻¹), Pt2Co/C@60 (0.49 A mgPt⁻¹) and Pt2Co/C@80 (0.43 A mgPt⁻¹) (Fig. 4d). The MA of the Pt2Co/C@40 is 3.3 and 3.0 times that of the Comm-Pt/C and Initial-Pt/C, respectively. In addition, the specific activity (SA) of the Pt2Co/C@40 was 1.32 mA cm⁻², which is 14 % and 23 % higher than that of Pt2Co/C@60 (1.16 mA cm⁻²) and Pt2Co/C@80 (1.07 mA cm⁻²), respectively. Table 2 listed the electrochemical data of the catalysts for a clear comparison. The higher mass/specific activities are originated from strain effects in which compressive strain in the alloyed structure results in a downshift of the d-band center, weakening the adsorption of oxygen-containing substances [53]. The Pt2Co/C@40 exceeded amongst the alloyed catalysts due to its relatively thinner Pt-rich shell (smaller size) together with stronger compressive strain, these combined effect contributed to the highest ORR activity [54]. Tafel slopes were obtained from the LSV curves of the catalysts. A smaller Tafel slope indicates a faster kinetics and higher catalyst activity [50]. The Pt2Co/C@40 shows the smallest Tafel slope in Fig. 5 a, confirming the fastest charge transfer and desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates. Rotating disk electrode was rotated from 400 r.p.m to 2000 r.p.m in Fig. 5b at different speeds. K-L plots in Fig. 5c can be used to calculate the number of electrons transferred (4.02), indicating that the Pt2Co/C@40 follows the favored 4-e pathway. Accelerated durability tests (ADTs) were conducted to evaluate the catalyst degradation. ECSA degradation is mainly attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles and the increase in particle size over long-term cycling [3,54]. Fig. 6 a-e displayed the ORR and ECSA changes with pre-determined potential cycles (0, 5k, 15k and 30k). The detailed ECSA and ORR mass activity with potential cycles are listed in Table 3 . The ECSA of the Initial-Pt/C and Pt2Co/C@40 after 30k cycles was 43.6 m² gPt⁻¹ and 35.9 m² gPt⁻¹, with a retention of 69 % and 80 %, respectively (Fig. 6a). The MA of the Initial-Pt/C decreased to 0.12 A mgPt -1 (with a retention rate of 60 %), in comparison, the Pt2Co/C@40 decreased to 0.41 A mgPt -1 (with a retention rate of 70 %), the Pt2Co/C@60 decreased to 0.35 A mgPt -1 (with a retention rate of 71 %); and the Pt2Co/C@80 decreased to 0.31 A mgPt -1 (with a retention rate of 73 %). In terms of mass activity degradation, the Pt2Co/C@80 catalyst showed the best durability, possibly because it has a sufficiently thick Pt atom shell, inhibiting the dissolution of inner Co atoms. However, even after degradation, the Pt2Co/C@40 catalyst still displays the highest mass activity, with a small difference in stability. The morphology changes of the Pt-alloyed catalysts before and after ADT were characterized by TEM, as was shown in the Fig. S6. After ADT, all the catalysts showed expected agglomeration of different extent, i.e. Pt2Co/C@40, Pt2Co/C@60 and Pt2Co/C@80 was grown to 5.9, 6.2, and 6.5 nm, respectively. It should be noted that the elemental distribution of the Pt2Co/C@40 did not change significantly before and after ADT (Fig. S7), with only a marginal and unavoidable decrease in Co content. 3.3 Single cell performance evaluated by MEA In order to find out whether high RDE performance of the Pt-alloyed catalyst can be translated to practical single cell advantage, two MEAs using the Pt2Co/C@40 and Comm-Pt/C as cathode (keeping the anode cathode and other conditions unchanged) was prepared for a fair comparison. Fig. 7 a displayed the polarization curves for the two MEAs. It can be found that the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA out-performed that of the Comm-Pt/C-MEA in terms of peak power density (PPD) and current density@ 0.65 V, which was 1.02 W cm-2 and 1.25 A cm-2 for the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA and 1.38 W cm-2 and 1.56 A cm-2 for Comm-Pt/C-MEA, respectively (Fig. 7b). In addition, the mass activity at 0.9 V was evaluated based on the polarization curves using in the following equation: MA = J L P t where J represents the current density measured at 0.9 V, LPt refers to the platinum (Pt) loading. The MA for the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA (0.41 A mgPt -1) was enhanced by a factor of 1.6 times compared to that of the Comm-Pt/C-MEA (0.16 A mgPt -1). To further evaluate the stability of the MEAs, a square wave potential cycling was performed. The potential was cruised between 0.6 V and 0.95 V (holding for 3 s at these two potentials) for a total of 30k cycles. From the I-V curves in Fig. 7c, it can be found that, after MEAs stability test, the peak power density of the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA decreased by 21.8 %, whereas that of the PPD of the Comm-Pt/C-MEA decreased by 29.6 %. In addition, as was shown in Fig. 7d, the MA of the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA and Comm-Pt/C-MEA decreased by 28.4 % and 15.9 %, respectively. In summary, the better performance and stability of the Pt2Co/C@40 evaluated by RDE was well translated to more practical single cell test by MEA. The reasons why the Pt2Co/C@40 catalyst registered superior electrochemical performance must have its origin from the materials’ inherent characteristics. First, the compressive strain effect aroused by the Co incorporation lowered the catalyst's d-band center, weakening the oxygen-containing intermediates adsorption in ORR. Second, the introduction of cobalt-ammonia complexes might have invited N-doping of trace amount, generating the protective Co-N bonds. Third, treating the alloy at 40 °C by nitric acid built up the catalyst structure with an Pt-rich shell of 3–4 layers, enhancing Pt utilization. The synergistic combined effects were all conducive to the better performance of the Pt2Co/C@40 both in terms of RDE and single-cell evaluation in ORR. 4 Conclusion Nitric acid dealloying was used to treat the as-prepared Pt2Co/C catalysts at different temperatures. A 3–4 atomic Pt layer was obtained after de-alloying at 40 °C in 0.5 M HNO3 for 3 h. The mass activity and specific activity of the Pt2Co/C@40 catalyst was found to be 0.59 A mgPt⁻¹ and 1.32 mA cm⁻², which was 3.3 and 5.5 times that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The highest activity also confirmed by single-cell test in which the Pt2Co/C@40-MEA exhibited a peak power density of 1.38 W cm-2 and a mass activity of 0.41 A mgPt -1. The Pt2Co/C@40 also revealed the best stability, both confirmed by half and single cell evaluations. The increase in activity and durability is mainly attributed to the compressive strain effect and the formation of Pt-rich shell layer due to acid de-alloying. This work conclude that the best activity of the de-alloyed catalyst is transferable from RDE performance to more practical MEA evaluation.

        "dc:description": "One of the key issues hinders large-scale commercial application of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells is the unsatisfactory performance of the Pt cathodic electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The generally accepted solution is to alloy Pt with transitional metals at high temperatures. These catalysts are commonly prepared through high temperature annealing followed by de-alloying in acidic electrolytes. This work focuses on the effects of acid de-alloying on the structure of the Pt2Co/C catalysts and correlates with their activity and stability for ORR. It is found that the overall performance of the Pt2Co/C is greatly affected by the acid treatment temperatures (40, 60 and 80 °C). When the Pt2Co/C is treated at 40 °C in HNO3, the Pt2Co/C-40 displays the highest activity and stability, which is double-confirmed both by half-cell (rotating disk electrode) and single cell (membrane electrode assembly) evaluations. The catalyst treated under this condition reveals an alloyed structure with 3–4 Pt atomic layers and an optimal particle size of 4.8 nm. Meanwhile, the performance enhancement is possibly also aided by the introduced N-sources during synthesis. This synthesis offers an easier and scalable manner to produce Pt-alloyed catalyst with enhanced activity and stability.",
