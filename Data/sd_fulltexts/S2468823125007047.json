The development of efficient, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts remains a central challenge for sustainable hydrogen production. In this work, we systematically designed a series of single transition metal (TM) atoms (including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) anchored on a WS2 monolayer, and investigated their catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The comprehensive results reveal that TM atoms can effectively tune the electronic structure, electrical conductivity, and hydrogen adsorption behavior of WS2. In particular, Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 catalysts exhibit Gibbs free energies of hydrogen adsorption close to zero, indicating their promising HER activity. Further crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analyses and Bader charge calculations demonstrate that the chemical bonding characteristics and charge transfer between the TM atoms and the WS2 substrate play a pivotal role in tuning adsorption strength and catalytic performance. This work provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing WS2-based single-atom catalysts and opens new avenues for the design of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts based on two-dimensional materials.

Green hydrogen production, particularly via water splitting, is regarded as a crucial solution for building a clean and renewable energy system [1–5]. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as the key half-reaction in water splitting, plays a decisive role in determining the overall efficiency and economic viability of hydrogen production through its kinetic properties [6–9]. While various approaches including photocatalysis and photo-electrocatalysis are capable of driving HER, their efficiencies remain constrained by narrow light-absorption ranges and rapid charge-carrier recombination [10–12]. In contrast, electrocatalysis offers higher energy efficiency and better reaction controllability, making it the preferred choice for large-scale applications. Therefore, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective HER electrocatalysts has become a central challenge for enabling the large-scale implementation of the hydrogen economy. Platinum is considered the most ideal catalyst for HER due to its exceptional catalytic performance. However, its resource scarcity, high cost, and limited stability significantly hinder large-scale applications [13–15]. This has driven intense efforts to develop non-precious, low-cost alternatives with comparable or superior catalytic activity. Among emerging alternatives, two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates owing to their unique layered structures, abundant exposed active sites, and excellent charge transport capabilities [16–22]. Yet material-specific limitations persist. For example, graphene exhibits outstanding conductivity but lacks intrinsic catalytic activity, requiring activation via heteroatom doping or defect engineering [23–25]. MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, offer metallic conductivity and moderate catalytic activity, yet suffer from instability of surface functional groups [26,27]. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like MoS2 and WS2, have attracted considerable attention due to their chemical stability and layered nature. However, their catalytic activity is largely confined to edge sites, while the inert basal planes are dominate [28–30]. To address these constraints, designing TMD-based materials with enhanced intrinsic activity, increased exposure of active sites, and improved conductivity has become a key strategy in next-generation HER catalysis. Among various TMD materials, tungsten disulfide (WS2) exhibits superior intrinsic properties. Specifically, WS2 exhibits an ultrahigh carrier mobility and significantly lower dissolution rates in acidic electrolytes [31,32]. Nevertheless, similar to MoS2, the catalytic activity of WS2 remains limited by the chemical inertness of its basal plane [33,34]. Consequently, enhancing its catalytic performance while maintaining structural stability thus remains a key research focus. To this end, constructing multifunctional WS2-based composites or introducing heteroatoms to modulate its electronic structure and active sites has emerged as an effective strategy for developing high-performance HER catalysts [35,36]. In recent years, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in electrocatalysis due to their atomically dispersed active centers, nearly 100 % atomic utilization, and electronic structure modulation capabilities [37–42]. Inspired by the unique advantages of SACs, an intriguing question arises: Can anchoring transition metal atoms on WS2 effectively activate its inert basal plane? Furthermore, if so, could their electronic interactions modulate the local structure to control hydrogen adsorption behavior and catalytic reaction pathways? Building upon this concept, we systematically designed and investigated a series of single transition metal (TM) atoms (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) anchored on monolayer WS2, and employed first-principles calculations to evaluate their effects on catalytic performance. We comprehensively explored how these TM atoms modulate the electronic structure, hydrogen adsorption free energy, and reaction pathways of WS2. While previous studies on WS2 based SACs have demonstrated the potential of transition metal doping, most of them focused on limited metal species or specific mechanistic aspects. Our work advances this field by providing a systematic comparison across a broad range of TM@WS2 systems, explicitly assessing both Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction pathways. Notably, Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 exhibit outstanding HER activity, with Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption close to zero. Further COHP and Bader charge analyses reveal that the bonding characteristics and charge transfer between the TM centers and the WS2 substrate are pivotal for optimizing hydrogen adsorption strength and catalytic activity. This study offers not only theoretical guidance for developing efficient and stable WS2-based HER catalysts but also provides new insights for the rational design of single-atom catalysts on 2D materials. 2 Computational methods and models All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [43], as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [44,45]. The interactions between ions and electrons were described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [46,47]. During geometry optimization, the kinetic energy cutoff for plane wave expansion was set to be 550 eV, the convergence criteria for force and energy were set to 0.01 eV Å-1 and 10–5 eV. Van der Waals interactions between adsorbates and catalysts were accounted for using the DFT-D3 method within Grimme’s scheme [48]. The vacuum space was set to be 20 Å in the z direction to avoid interlayer interactions. A 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid was adopted to sample the Brillouin zone during the geometry optimization, while a denser 15 × 15 × 1 k-grid mesh was used for the computations on electronic properties. Bader charge population analysis was used to obtain the charge transfer. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method with 7 images was employed to locate the transition state and compute the corresponding kinetic barrier. The convergence threshold of the CI-NEB calculation was set to a maximum force below 0.05 eV Å-1 [49]. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was not included in the present calculations, as our study focused on TM anchored WS2 systems without defect states where SOC effects are less significant [50]. The HER catalytic activity of a given catalyst in acidic media can be evaluated by the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔG H*) according to the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model [51,52]: ∆G H* = ∆E H* + ∆E ZPE − T∆S H*, where △E H* represents the hydrogen adsorption energy: Δ E H * = E H * − E * 1 2 E H 2 , where E H* and Ε ∗ represent the total DFT energies of the catalyst with and without H adsorption, respectively. ΔE ZPE and ΔS H* denote the difference of zero-point energy and entropy between the adsorbed and the gas phase. Notably, the ∆E ZPE can be determined based on the computed vibrational frequencies, while the ΔS H* was taken as approximately equal to -½S0H2, where S0H2 refers to the entropy of hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure. Therefore, following previous theoretical studies, the hydrogen adsorption free energy is estimated using: ∆G H* = ΔE H* + 0.24 eV [53–55]. The optimal value for highly efficient HER is ΔG H* = 0. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometric and electronic structures of TM@WS2 After full relaxation, the obtained 2D WS2 monolayer unit cell structure was obtained as shown in Fig. 1 , with lattice constants of a = b = 3.18 Å, in excellent agreement with previous reports [56,57]. To evaluate the anchoring stability of TM atoms on the WS2 surface, a 4 × 4 supercell containing 48 atoms was constructed as the computational model for TM adsorption and anchoring. As illustrated in Fig. 1, three typical adsorption sites on the WS2 surface were considered: the hollow site at the center of the hexagonal ring (hollow-site), the top of the S atom (S-top site), and the top of the W atom (W-top site). To quantify the thermodynamic stability of TM atom anchoring, the binding energies were calculated using the following equation: Eb (TM) = ETM@sub − Esub − ΕΤΜ, where ETM@sub is the total energy of the TM-anchored system, Esub is the energy of the pristine WS2 substrate, and ΕΤΜ is the energy of an isolated TM atom in vacuum. A negative binding energy indicates thermodynamic stability, and a larger absolute value corresponds to stronger interaction between the metal atom and the substrate. Calculation results indicate that all TM atoms preferentially adsorb at the W-top site (see Table S1). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2 , the binding energies of these TM@WS2 systems are all negative, confirming that the TM atoms can be stably anchored on the WS2 surface. To further elucidate the electronic interaction induced by TM atom anchoring, we performed Bader charge analysis on the adsorption systems (Fig. 3 ). The results show significant charge transfer from all anchored TM atoms to the WS2 substrate, endowing the metal centers with varying degrees of positive charge. This strongly indicates robust electronic interaction between the TM atoms and the substrate. Notably, the extent of charge transfer correlates well with the electronegativity of TM atoms. For example, Hf with the lowest electronegativity (1.30), donates approximately 0.93 e − to the substrate, while more electronegative Au (2.54) only donates about 0.02 e −. This marked difference highlights the electron affinity of metal atoms plays a determining role in the strength of electronic interactions with the substrate. Moreover, the resulting moderate positive charge on the TM centers helps modulate their local electronic structure, thereby tuning the electrical conductivity of TM@WS2. Such a modulation mechanism has been shown to promote the adsorption of proton-electron pairs and facilitate electron transfer, both of which are essential for efficient HER kinetics [58]. Building upon the charge transfer analysis, we further investigated the impact of TM atom anchoring on the band structure of WS2. As shown in Fig. S1, pristine WS2 exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of approximately 1.80 eV, consistent with previously reported values, thereby validating the accuracy of our computational approach employed in this study [59,60]. Upon introduction of TM atoms, significant modifications occur at both the conduction and valence band edges of WS2, leading to a systematic reduction in the band gap. Remarkably, some TM@WS2 systems even display semi-metallic or metallic behavior (Table S1 and Fig. S1). This behavior arises from the introduction of additional electronic states by the TM atoms during anchoring, which dramatically enhances the density of states near the Fermi level and in turn enhances electronic conductivity. Combined with the aforementioned charge redistribution, the presence of TM atoms not only alters the charge distribution but also synergistically tunes the band structure. This dual effect of charge transfer and band engineering collectively optimizes the catalytic electronic environment of WS2, providing more efficient charge transfer channels and active sites for HER. 3.2 H adsorption on TM@WS2 catalysts After confirming the structural stability and electronic modulation effect of the TM@WS2 systems, we further evaluated their catalytic performance for HER. Given that hydrogen atom adsorption behavior plays a decisive role in HER activity [61], we calculated the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG H*) of different TM@WS2 configurations to assess the catalytic potential of various active sites. According to the Sabatier principle, an ideal adsorption free energy of H atom on a catalyst should be close to 0 eV, typically within ±0.2 eV, ensuring an optimal balance between hydrogen adsorption and desorption, thereby enabling efficient HER catalysis [61,62]. We systematically examined multiple possible H adsorption sites on the TM@WS2 surface, including the top of the TM atom (TM-top site); adjacent S atoms near TM atom (S1 site), and non-bonded S atoms surrounding TM center (S2 site). Comparative analysis revealed that TM top sites generally exhibited the most stable hydrogen adsorption, and therefore all subsequent ΔG H* analyses were based on these sites (Table S2). As shown in Fig 4 a, the results show that H adsorption on the pristine WS2 is unfavorable (1.98 eV), after TM atom anchoring, the calculated ΔG H* values demonstrated significant tunability across different TM@WS2 systems, ranging from −0.78 eV to 0.84 eV. Notably, Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 system exhibit exceptionally favorable ΔG H* of −0.15 eV, 0.16 eV, −0.11 eV, and −0.20 eV, respectively, all approaching the thermodynamically ideal value of 0 eV, indicating excellent catalytic activity for HER. To further contextualize these results, we compared the predicted HER activity of our TM@WS2 catalysts with previously reported SACs/TMD systems. For example, Co@WSe2 [63], Ni@WSe2 [63], and V@As2S3 [64] were reported to exhibit ΔG H* values of −0.90, −0.20, and −0.29 eV, respectively, which are less favorable than those of Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 in this work. This comparison demonstrates that our best-performing TM@WS2 catalysts exhibit superior HER activity relative to representative SACs/TMD systems. To further evaluate the HER activity of different TM@WS2 catalysts, we calculated their exchange current densities (i₀) based on Nørskov's model [65]. Specifically, when ∆G H* ≤ 0, the exchange current density can be estimated using the following equation: i 0 = − e k 0 1 1 + exp ( − Δ G H * / k B T ) ; for another case (∆G H* > 0), the exchange current is calculated as: i 0 = − e k 0 1 1 + exp ⁡ ( Δ G H * / k B T ) , where k 0 is the rate constant, due to the lack of experimentally determined k₀ values, we normalized k₀ to 1 in this work, and kB represents the Boltzmann constant under ambient conditions. Based on the calculated i₀ values, we constructed a HER volcano plot for all TM@WS2 electrocatalysts (Fig. 4b). According to the Sabatier principle, the peak of the volcano curve corresponds to catalysts with optimal adsorption and desorption balance of hydrogen, thereby exhibiting the best HER performance [66]. As shown in Fig. 4b, Cr@WS2, Mo@WS2, Fe@WS2, and Ru@WS2 are located near the top of the volcano, indicating higher exchange current densities and superior catalytic activities. In contrast, catalysts with ∆G H* values deviating significantly from zero exhibit lower i₀ values and consequently limited HER activity. 3.3 Adsorption activity relationship of TM@WS2 catalysts To gain deeper insight into the bonding mechanism between TM active sites and adsorbed H atoms, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method, as employed in the LOBSTER [67], was employed to investigate the electronic characteristics of chemical bonds and to establish a correlation between integrated COHP (ICOHP) values and ΔG H* (Fig. S2). In COHP analysis, negative values (below zero) correspond to bonding states, whereas positive values (above zero) indicate antibonding states. The ICOHP is obtained by integrating the COHP curve for the electronic states below zero up to the Fermi level, thus, a more negative ICOHP implies stronger bonding interactions [68–70]. As shown in Fig. 5 a, ICOHP exhibits a strong linear relationship with ΔG H* and R2 = 0.81, suggesting that ICOHP can effectively reflect the adsorption strength between TM active sites and H atoms. For instance, the Pd@WS2 shows the weakest bonding interaction, with an ICOHP of −0.51 and a corresponding ΔG H* of 0.84 eV, indicating the poorest H adsorption. Cr@WS2, Ru@WS2, Fe@WS2, and Mo@WS2 possess moderate ICOHP values (−1.20, −1.45, −1.56, and −1.70, respectively) and ΔG H* values also in an intermediate range, suggesting these catalysts achieve balanced H atom adsorption that facilitates both effective H activation and subsequent desorption. In contrast, W@WS2 exhibits the strongest bonding interaction, with an ICOHP of –1.91 and a corresponding ΔG H* of −0.89 eV, indicating the strongest H adsorption. However, excessively strong H adsorption can hinder subsequent H desorption. This linear correlation between ICOHP and ΔG H* not only validates the adsorption trend from a chemical bonding perspective but also confirms the excellent HER catalytic potential of Cr@WS2, Ru@WS2, Fe@WS2, and Mo@WS2. Building upon this, we further systematically investigated the correlation between the d-band center (εd) and the ΔG H*. Although the εd is commonly regarded as a key descriptor of catalytic activity in metal-based catalysts, our results show that no clear linear relationship exists between εd and ΔG H* across the various TM@WS2 systems studied (as shown in Fig. S3). This observation is consistent with previous reports on certain transition metal dichalcogenide systems and other 2D materials [71,72], suggesting that in WS2-based materials, there is a strong interaction between the d-electron states of TM active sites and the coordination environment of sulfur atoms imposes limitations on using εd alone to explain HER activity. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of hydrogen adsorption behavior and catalytic performance in TM@WS2 systems requires consideration of multidimensional electronic structure features and other relevant factors. Accordingly, we analyzed the relationship between the εd and the Bader charge in WS2-based systems. Unlike the lack of direct correlation between the d-band center and ΔG H*, a strong linear relationship exists between the εd and the Bader charge (Fig. 5b), indicating that the electronic filling state of metal sites significantly regulates their d-orbital energy levels. Specifically, a more negative Bader charge value indicating greater electron loss from the metal center, correlates with the εd shifting closer to the Fermi level, corresponding to an upward displacement of d-electron states. The observed strong correlation between charge transfer and εd modification demonstrates that the charge state of transition metal can effectively modulate its local electronic structure, thereby potentially influencing adsorption properties and catalytic activity. This interdependence partially compensates for the limitations of relying solely on εd to accurately explain ΔG H*. Notably, similar linear relationships between the εd and Bader charge have been reported in other transition-metal-based materials systems, further validating the universality of this trend [73,74]. Therefore, while εd alone may not directly describe hydrogen adsorption strength in TM@WS2 systems, its strong correlation with Bader charge suggests that a combined descriptor incorporating both charge transfer + εd could provide a more comprehensive strategy for rationalizing catalytic activity trends. Such an approach would not only capture the multidimensional nature of electronic structure effects but also offer guidance for performance optimization and future high-throughput catalyst screening. From a kinetic perspective, we further investigated the HER mechanisms of Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2, focusing on two representative reaction pathways: the Heyrovsky reaction (H* + H + + e − → H2 + *) and the Tafel reaction (2H* → H2 + *). To determine the more favorable pathway for each catalyst, we calculated the energy barriers for hydrogen evolution via both mechanisms (Fig. S4). The results reveal that Cr@WS2 and Mo@WS2 exhibit lower energy barriers of 0.42 eV and 0.37 eV, respectively, for the Tafel pathway, which is significantly more favorable than their corresponding Heyrovsky barriers (1.30 eV and 0.88 eV), indicating a predominant Tafel mechanism. In contrast, Fe@WS2 and Ru@WS2 demonstrate superior kinetics for the Heyrovsky pathway with remarkably low barriers of 0.34 eV and 0.01 eV, respectively, compared to their Tafel barriers (2.15 eV and 1.53 eV). These distinct kinetic preferences (Tafel-dominant for Cr/Mo systems vs. Heyrovsky-dominant for Fe/Ru systems) highlight the crucial role of metal centers in governing reaction pathway selection, and provide fundamental insights into the structure-activity relationships in HER catalysis. In summary, these results warrant comparison with experimental benchmarks and other reported systems to better assess their practical significance. To this end, we compared our calculated Heyrovsky and Tafel barriers with representative values reported for other systems and experimental studies. Previous combined theoretical and experimental studies on MoS2-based catalysts reported Heyrovsky barriers of ∼1.3 eV at 0 V and Tafel barriers of ∼0.6–0.7 eV, with overall Volmer–Tafel barriers reaching ∼1.6–1.7 eV when diffusion contributions are included. Experimentally, MoS2 exhibits exchange current densities several orders of magnitude lower than Pt-based catalysts, consistent with the higher kinetic barriers predicted theoretically. Importantly, both computational and experimental results agree that the Heyrovsky pathway is generally more favorable than the Tafel pathway on MoS2, although DFT-calculated absolute barrier values are typically overestimated by ∼0.3 eV due to methodological limitations [75]. In this context, the significantly lower Heyrovsky and Tafel barriers obtained for Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 suggest that these TM@WS2 catalysts could achieve more competitive HER kinetics not only compared with conventional MoS2-based systems but also relative to other reported single-atom catalysts, while remaining consistent with experimentally observed trends. Finally, to evaluate the thermal stability of the highly active TM@WS2 catalysts under realistic working conditions, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed on Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 systems at 500 K for 5 ps [76,77]. As shown in Fig. S5, all four systems exhibited small fluctuations in total energy. No metal atom detachment from the WS2 surface or significant structural distortion was observed during the simulations, confirming excellent thermal stability of the TM atoms anchored on the WS2 surface. Overall, these catalysts demonstrate favorable stability from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, providing theoretical support for their potential efficiency and durability in practical electrocatalytic HER applications. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have systematically investigated the HER catalytic performance of a series of single transition metal atoms anchored on a WS2 monolayer using first-principles calculations. The results indicate that TM atoms not only enhance the electronic conductivity of WS2 but also effectively modulate the hydrogen adsorption free energy and reaction pathways. Notably, Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 demonstrate optimal HER activity with ΔG H* values approaching zero. COHP and Bader charge analyses further elucidate the intrinsic correlation between metal-support interactions and catalytic efficiency, highlighting the crucial role of electronic structure engineering in catalyst optimization. Importantly, the identification of Cr, Fe, Mo, and Ru as highly active centers provides concrete guidance for experimental synthesis, suggesting that targeted incorporation of these metals into WS2 supports could achieve catalysts with superior HER performance. This work therefore provides a theoretical foundation for the development of high-performance and stable HER catalysts based on WS2, and broadens the design strategies for single-atom catalysis on two-dimensional materials.

        "dc:description": "The development of efficient, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts remains a central challenge for sustainable hydrogen production. In this work, we systematically designed a series of single transition metal (TM) atoms (including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) anchored on a WS2 monolayer, and investigated their catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The comprehensive results reveal that TM atoms can effectively tune the electronic structure, electrical conductivity, and hydrogen adsorption behavior of WS2. In particular, Cr@WS2, Fe@WS2, Mo@WS2, and Ru@WS2 catalysts exhibit Gibbs free energies of hydrogen adsorption close to zero, indicating their promising HER activity. Further crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analyses and Bader charge calculations demonstrate that the chemical bonding characteristics and charge transfer between the TM atoms and the WS2 substrate play a pivotal role in tuning adsorption strength and catalytic performance. This work provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing WS2-based single-atom catalysts and opens new avenues for the design of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts based on two-dimensional materials.",
