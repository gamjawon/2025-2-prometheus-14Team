Graphical abstract Water gas shift (WGS) reaction over a noble metal free Co-system catalyst was investigated. Although K/Co3O4 showed no WGS activity with no pre-treatment, it showed high and stable activity after reduction by CO+H2 (syngas). Moreover, the high activity was retained even after post-treatment in water vapor. Characterization of the catalyst was conducted using XRD, XPS, and XAFS, which revealed that conducting pre-reduction, especially using CO+H2 caused the formation of Co2C, which is a potential candidate as an active site, and that K donated electrons during reduction to form stable Co2C, suppressing the formation of metallic Co. The catalyst has high competence in activity with noble metal WGS catalysts and conventional LTS catalyst, which can be a promising candidate for a WGS reaction catalyst. Keywords Water gas shift Co catalyst Role of potassium Hydrogen production 1 Introduction The water gas shift (WGS) reaction for carbon monoxide removal has been investigated over the years, along with the development of the steam reforming reaction. WGS is an important reaction for hydrogen production for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) or other hydrogen production processes. Furthermore, considering carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in hydrocarbon utilization, WGS is an important reaction for this purpose. The reaction equation is shown below. (1) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 ΔH 0 298.15 =−41.2kJmol−1 Most industrial hydrogen production processes include two WGS stages for removing CO at a high rate. In the first step, high-temperature shift (HTS) proceeds at 590–730K, accompanied by Fe-Cr catalyst. The next step, low-temperature shift (LTS) proceeds at 320–573K, accompanied by Cu/Zn catalyst [1]. For HTS, the reaction is regulated by thermodynamic equilibrium because the WGS reaction is exothermic. For LTS, the required amount of catalyst is extensive for achieving low CO concentration [2] because the reaction order for CO is close to 1. It is necessary to develop a WGS process that proceeds in a one-step reaction, and to develop a catalyst that is stable at rather low temperatures, with high tolerance to an oxidative condition in steam or air. Many works for WGS catalysts have been reported in the past three decades. Noble metals reportedly enhance the activity of metal-based catalysts [3–6], but their scarcity raises the price of metals, creating concerns when applying the catalyst in an industrial setting. Furthermore, several combinations of metals have been reported as candidates for use as LTS catalysts [7–11]. Co catalysts are known to be highly active for WGS at high temperatures [12–14]. We have proposed a Co-system catalyst: Pd/K/Co3O4 [15] and have reported that it shows highly stable WGS activity. The catalyst, however, includes palladium, a noble metal described above. Therefore, we investigated noble metal free K/Co3O4 catalyst with various pretreatments. Although it shows no activity with no pre-reduction, CO+H2 pre-reduction enabled the catalyst to show high activity, even without noble metals. Potassium loading and the pre-reduction mode are necessary for the catalyst to show high activity. Therefore, the active structure and the effect of K loading along with CO+H2 pre-reduction over the catalyst were investigated. Moreover, the conventional LTS catalyst (Cu/Zn system described above) is known to degrade after repeated oxidation and reduction. Particularly, the effects of steam in air are unavoidable when catalysts are used in industrial systems. Therefore, we also compared the robustness of K/Co3O4 catalyst with Cu/Zn catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation method Each Co-system catalyst was prepared using impregnation with Co3O4 (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc.) as a support. K was loaded using an aqueous solution of K2CO3 as a precursor. Details of the preparation methods applied are described elsewhere [15]. The loading amount of potassium was changed in the range of 0.20–5.89wt%. To compare the activity of our catalyst with that of conventional LTS catalyst, we prepared a model Cu/Zn catalyst using a co-precipitation method [16–19]. An aqueous solution containing copper and zinc nitrates (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O; molar ratio is 1.0) and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate was added simultaneously to water with constant stirring. The precipitation temperature was maintained at 338K. The obtained precipitate was filtrated and washed with distilled water. Then, dried at 393K for 12h, and calcined in air at 623K for 2h. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests Activity tests were conducted using a fixed bed flow reactor. In a standard condition, 40mg of catalyst were packed in a glass tube (8mm diameter) with quartz wool and set in a furnace. Catalytic activities for all catalysts were evaluated in a pseudo-kinetic condition (i.e., not high conversion, not close to thermodynamic equilibrium of WGS). The furnace was heated to 573K at a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. Inert gas was Ar/He. The composition of pseudo-WGS gas was CO:H2O:H2:Ar:He=10:50:70:33:147. The composition of the reaction gas was determined considering an ideal gas composition of methane steam reforming and consecutive partly shift (50%) by WGS. CH4 +H2O→CO+3H2 0.5CO+0.5H2O→0.5CO2 +0.5H2 The total flow rate was 310 SCCM. The reaction tube was connected to a Q-Mass (Model QGA; Hiden Analytical Ltd.) while the exit gas was measured. The pre-reduction conditions were the following: 3.3% CO+23% H2 or 23% H2 with a flow rate of 300mLmin−1 for 200min. The reproducibility of activity data was confirmed by the same experiments for many times, and the accuracy was within±2 points. 2.3 Characterization of catalysts BET measurements were conducted using a nitrogen physisorption apparatus (Gemini VII; Micrometrics Inc.). Each sample was pretreated at 523K in N2 flow for 2h before measurements. The specific surface area was measured at 77K with liquid nitrogen. It was calculated using the BET method. Powder XRD patterns of each catalyst (after pre-reduction using CO, H2, and CO+H2) were recorded using SmartLAB (Rigaku Corp.) equipped with Fe–Kα radiation over the range of 10–120°, 40kV at 20mA. The scan rate was 40°/min. XPS analyses were conducted (PHI-5000 VersaProbe II; Ulvac-Phi Inc.), with 25W Al Kα emission as the X-ray source. Each catalyst was treated with 3.3% CO+23% H2 (200min), or other reducing agents and cooled to room temperature during inert flow before analysis. Binding energies were calibrated with a C 1s peak at 284.8eV. To observe the fine structure of Co, X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) were observed at the BL14B2 station at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) using a transmission method. The catalyst was pressed into a pellet (7mm ϕ). Each sample was diluted with BN, and was reduced using CO+H2 using the same conditions as those for pre-reduction for activity tests, and was cooled to room temperature in He purge. Then the pellet was packed into a gas-barrier bag in N2 atmosphere, and measurement was conducted as it was. The XAFS data were analyzed using Athena software. The Fourier transformation of each k 3-weighed EXAFS spectrum was obtained in the k-range of 0.3–1.2nm−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Activity test 3.1.1 Effect of pre-reduction over Co-system catalysts First, it is noteworthy that K/Co3O4 shows no WGS activity if it is not pre-reduced. Reduction of the support (Co3O4) was necessary for the catalyst to show WGS activity. We examined activity tests with various pre-reduction conditions using K/Co3O4. Additionally, we prepared Cu/ZnO as a model for industrially used LTS catalyst. We compared the activities of 0.78wt%K/Co3O4, Co3O4, and Cu/ZnO; pre-reduction was conducted using H2 or CO+H2. Results are presented in Fig. 1 . The K/Co3O4 catalyst pre-reduced with syngas (CO+H2) showed high and stable WGS activity. However, K/Co3O4 pre-reduced by H2 showed no high WGS activity at the initial stage of the reaction. The catalytic activity on the catalyst pre-reduced by H2 still increased during the test for three hours, on the other hand, the catalyst pre-reduced by CO+H2 showed very high activity from the initial stage of the reaction. This shows an advantage of the reduction by CO+H2. Bare Co3O4 catalyst showed less or no WGS activity at all pretreatment conditions. TG results (Supporting data Fig. S1) showed that reducing Co3O4 using CO+H2 brought the catalyst into metallic Co. Our previous research revealed that Co metal shows no WGS activity [15]. K/Co3O4 pre-reduced by syngas (CO+H2) also showed high selectivity to CO2 and H2 more than 99% (not shown), and carbon deposition was under the detection limit of a temperature programmed oxidation apparatus. In the same pre-reduction condition, Cu/ZnO showed lower activity. Carbon balances were in 99.5%-100.5% for all experiments. Selectivity to methane formation was negligible small (<0.1%) for K-loaded Co-catalysts. Hydrogen has high reducing ability. Co3O4 was reduced to metallic Co, as described later in 3.2.1. Furthermore, reduced metallic-Co seems to have less or no WGS catalytic activity from these results. Potassium loading seems to suppress excess reduction of the Co. Potassium has the effect of stabilizing the activity and the structure of the catalyst. K/Co3O4 pre-reduced only by CO also showed high activity, as shown in Supporting data Fig. S2. However, considering an industrial use of the catalyst, pre-reduction by only CO is not feasible. CO+H2 is popularly used as syngas. Ultimately, we can obtain syngas from the exit side of the steam reforming reaction. Therefore, it is more convenient to use CO+H2 than CO as pre-reduction gas for K/Co3O4. As for the effect of CO2 coexistence in the reduction gas on the catalytic activity, we conducted the catalytic activity test of WGS over the catalyst pre-reduced by CO+H2 with CO2 (see supporting data Fig. S3), and results are compared to that on the catalyst pre-reduced by CO+H2 without CO2. From these results, CO conversions were almost the same in these two cases, so the coexistence of CO2 in the pre-reduction atmosphere did not affect the carbide formation and the catalytic activity. These data demonstrate that potassium loading and pretreatment by syngas are important for showing high and stable WGS activity on K/Co3O4. 3.1.2 Effect of alkali loading We investigated the effects of the loading amount of potassium on WGS catalytic activity. In addition to 0.78wt%K/Co3O4, we prepared 0.20wt%, 3.93wt%, and 5.89wt%K/Co3O4 catalysts, and conducted activity tests in the same conditions (CO+H2 was used as pre-reduction gas). Results are presented in Fig. 2 (a). 0.20wt%K/Co3O4 showed lower activity than those of the others. Apparently a threshold to the loading amount of potassium exists, but increasing the loading amount to 3.93wt% improved the CO conversion from about 65% (0.78wt%K) to>80%. However, the activity of 5.89wt%K/Co3O4 was lower than that of 3.93wt%K/Co3O4. These trends have no relation to the BET specific surface area (see Supporting data Table S1). Xinli et al. investigated Na-loaded catalyst for WGS reaction. They showed that too much addition of sodium decreased WGS activity of the catalyst because of the decrease of the exposed active sites by excess Na loading [20]. In the case of 5.89wt%K/Co3O4, too much potassium loading might have covered active sites of the catalyst and suppressed the WGS reaction. Also excessive K promoted too much CO dissociation (i.e., excessive carburization) leading to formation of amorphous carbonaceous residues on the catalyst surface as shown in Supporting data Fig. S4. Therefore, we inferred that the optimum loading amount of potassium for this catalyst to show high WGS activity was 0.78–3.93wt%K. We further investigated the role of alkali metal by preparing several Co-based catalysts with alkali metals of various kinds (M/Co3O4, where M: Na, K, Cs). The loading amount of alkali was set as the same for each catalyst. Catalytic activities over WGS reaction after 200min of CO+H2 pre-reduction are presented in Fig. 2(b). Na-loaded catalyst showed low WGS activity, although Cs-loading caused similar activity to that of K loading, but it showed fluctuation of WGS activity with time course. Because the ionization energy for Na is larger than K and Cs, it turns out that the strong binding between the atomic nucleus inhibits the effect of alkali metal loadings. There are some reports for the effect of alkali-addition to WGS catalyst, as follows; Panagiotopoulou et al. proposed that the added alkali interacts strongly with the TiO2 surface and results in the creation of Vox-Ti3+ defects which affect the chemisorptive properties at the metal-support interface [21]. The formed sites are catalytic active sites for WGS reaction, since they are capable of adsorption and activation of both CO and H2O. Hwang et al. proposed that potassium increases the density of active hydroxyl group that takes part in the WGS reaction to form intermediate [22]. Pigos et al. reported that the turnover rates of formate intermediates over 2%Pt/ZrO2 can be significantly improved by adding alkali cations, and the cations weakens the formate CH bond, and as a result, the formate decomposition rates are considerably improved [23]. Based on these results, the loading of potassium attributed to the electron donating from potassium to cobalt, which further modifies the structure of the support, which is consistent with several reports related to alkali loaded catalysts [21–24]. The effect of electron donation from potassium to cobalt is evaluated by XPS as explained later in Section 3.2.2. 3.1.3 Evaluation of robustness of catalytic activity When the water gas shift catalyst is used in an industrial condition, durability to steam is a key factor because the catalyst used in a WGS plant will be exposed in air or steam flow during its shutdown [25]. Therefore, we evaluated the robustness of catalytic activity after exposure to steam, comparing K/Co3O4 with the conventional LTS catalyst, Cu/ZnO. The experimental condition is the same as the activity tests above, excluding that after 40min of WGS reaction, the catalyst is deliberately deactivated by water vapor diluted with He for 30min. Then, the water gas shift reaction was conducted again to test the water-durability of the respective catalysts. Results of the experiment are presented in Table 1 . It is noteworthy that this experiment was conducted using 80mg of each catalyst because Cu/ZnO catalyst showed low WGS activity compared to K/Co3O4. The activity of 0.78wt%K/Co3O4 was almost entirely retained (only decreased 5.2 points), even after exposure to steam. However, the activity of Cu/ZnO decreased about 25% after H2O treatment. The steaming mimic might be not long term and not severe enough, nevertheless, these results show that K/Co3O4 pretreatment by syngas has better activity and robustness than Cu/ZnO. 3.2 Characterization of the catalyst 3.2.1 XRD XRD measurements were conducted to analyze the structure of the support after reduction by CO, H2, and CO+H2. Results are depicted in Fig. 3 . After H2 reduction, all peaks were attributed to Co metal. However, after CO or CO+H2 reduction, several peaks showing Co2C were observed. The spectra after CO reduction also include some peaks that are attributed to CoO. Therefore, H2 has too much of a strong reduction property. CO pre-reduction for 3.93wt%K/Co3O4 caused the low initial activity (Supporting data Fig. S2). Pre-treatment by syngas is more favorable than pre-treatment by CO. Moreover, to clarify whether CoO shows WGS activity or not, we conducted activation tests using K/CoO without pre-reduction. However, it showed no WGS activity at all (not shown). Considering these results, Co2C is apparently an important active species to proceed with WGS reaction. Furthermore, some researchers have reported that cobalt carbide shows WGS activity. For example, Gnanamani et al. reported that Co3O4 can be carburized to form Co2C, which shows high WGS activity by reduction with CO for 52h, a very long term pre-treatment [26]. Nagai et al. also reported that the 873 K-carburized Co0.5Mo0.5 oxide is the most active among the Co–Mo carbide catalysts [12]. Considering these reports and our results, Co2C is expected to be the active species to catalyze the WGS reaction in our investigation. 3.2.2 XPS XPS analysis was conducted to elucidate the role of supported potassium and structure of the catalyst. Co 2p spectra of Co-system catalysts after several pretreatments are portrayed in Fig. 4 (A). Peaks around 780–781eV can be attributed to Co3+, 782eV to Co2+, and 785–786eV to satellite peaks [27], whereas Co0+ can be attributed to peaks observed at 778.1eV [28,29]. Furthermore, the results for deconvolution of each spectrum are presented in Table 2 . The binding energy which gives the peak of each spectrum is shown there, along with its area ratio. First, spectra for Co3O4 without loading potassium, and not reduced (only calcined) were composed of about 40% of Co2+ and 60% of Co3+. However, after 3.93wt% of potassium loading and conducting CO+H2 reduction, the peak shifted to the side of Co2+. As Table 2 shows, the composition of Co3+ decreased. The peak for 3.93wt%K/Co3O4 pre-reduced by H2 which showed less catalytic activity, shows Co metal also appeared strongly. These results suggest that loading of potassium suppresses excess reduction of the support. K 2p spectra are portrayed in Fig. 4(B). 292.2eV is attributed to K+ from K2CO3 [30]. The spectrum of K/Co3O4 catalysts as made showed a peak close to that of K2CO3 derived from the precursor used to prepare the catalyst, but CO+H2 reduction shifts the peak towards a higher binding energy, indicating deficiency in electrons. In the case of 0.78wt%K, the peak shifted to 292.7eV, and for 3.93wt%K, it shifted to 293.1eV. These results suggest that potassium donates electrons to cobalt to form cobalt-carbide as an active site. Although the shift seems slightly greater at lower amount of K, the total amount of electron donation is apparently larger at 3.93wt%K. Results of some previous works have suggested that potassium donates electron to the support as explained in Section 3.1.2 [21–24]. Some other works postulated that electron donation is important for carbide formation [31–33]. Results from these three studies are applicable to our system. Potassium seems to increase its electron density for carburizing cobalt as an active site of WGS. 3.2.3 EXAFS To clarify the fine structure of Co, EXAFS measurements were investigated. The results for Co K-edge are presented in Fig. 5 and Supporting data Fig. S5, Table S2. Co foil was used as a reference sample. The most noticeable peak on Co foil shows that the Co–Co bond is near 0.2nm. The same peak appeared both for 0.78wt%K/Co3O4 and 3.93wt%K/Co3O4. The peak, however, was stronger with lower loading amount of K. This trend is the same as that of results shown in XPS spectra for Co 2p 3/2. When the loading amount of K is lower, the bulk structure is also reduced to Co metal, and carbide formation is difficult. From these results, potassium loading brought electron donation from K to cobalt-carbide as an active site for WGS, and suppresses the formation of Co metal which was not active for WGS. 4 Conclusion We investigated the activity of a noble metal free Co-system catalyst for the WGS reaction. K/Co3O4 catalyst shows no WGS activity without pre-treatment, but it shows high stable activity after pre-reduction with syngas for 200min. Pre-reduction by syngas can form Co2C as active sites more effectively than either CO or H2 reduction. Potassium loading stabilizes the catalyst structure in a reduction atmosphere, and has an electron-donating effect. Loading potassium suppresses excess reduction of Co-oxide to metallic Co, and promotes the formation of Co2+ to form Co2C active species more effectively. The catalyst can compete against noble metal catalysts and conventional LTS catalysts by virtue of its high and robust activity.
