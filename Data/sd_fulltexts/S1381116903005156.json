The effect of MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n catalysts with different phosphorus content for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein and with XRD and TPR characterization. Several MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n catalysts with different P-content were prepared. These catalysts showed a definite activity for the selective oxidation propane to acrolein at 773K, and the maximum yield of acrolein attained to 21.9% as the content of phosphorus equaled to 0.15. The catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies. The experimental results revealed that the addition of phosphorus not only change the crystalloid phases of the catalysts but also affect the redox capability of the catalysts, which greatly improved the performance of the catalyst. Keywords Acrolein Mixed metal oxides catalysts Selective oxidation Propane 1 Introduction The use of mixed metal oxides for the partial oxidation of olefins was already well established, with the high selective processes for producing butadiene, isoprene and acrolein about 40 years ago. Because of the current abundance and low cost of alkanes, recently, however, more and more interests have been generated in the oxidative catalytic conversion of alkanes other than olefins to produce oxygenates and nitriles in both petroleum and petrochemical industries, although it was well known that those alkanes were low reactive because they had no lone pairs of electrons, no empty orbital and the polarity of the CH bonds was very little. Researches had shown that the mixed metal oxides, especially Mo–V–M–O (M=Al, Ga, Bi, Sb and Te) [1–4] and Mo–V–Te–Nb oxides [5–11] were highly catalytically active for the selective oxidation/ammoxidation of propane to acrylic acid/acrylonitrile. For economic and ecological reasons, the direct synthesis of acrolein from propane in a single-stage process attracted much attention [12–16]. Such a technical process could not be realized up to now. In the most case for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein, both selectivity and yield of acrolein were very low because propane was very inactive and acrolein was easily further oxidized under the reaction condition. One of the major problems that prevent the technical application of the reaction is the availability of the catalyst that transforms the propane with high yield into the desired product acrolein. While high selectivity has often been obtained for the reaction at a low conversion level, the selectivity towards the desired acrolein decreased dramatically with increasing conversion. It has been reported that phosphorus, as one of the content of the mixed metal oxides, could affect on selective oxidation of propane [17,18]. In our study on the series catalysts of MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n , we not only obtained the maximum yield of acrolein as high as 21.9% which has not been reported before, but also found that addition of phosphorus could change the phases of the catalysts and greatly affect the redox of the catalysts, which may be one of the reasons improving the performance of the catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation All the reagents were commercially obtained and used without further purification. Into three flasks each with 30ml of water, 0.8828g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.2641g H2TeO4·2H2O and 0.1755g NH4VO3 were added, respectively and heated at 353K. After dissolved, the three solutions were mixed and became a rose solution. Into the mixed solution, different amount (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00mmol) of phosphoric acid was added. The solution was evaporated to dryness at 353K, dried at 423K, and calcined at 873K in a stream of nitrogen for 2h, respectively. Some black metal oxides were formed and the formula of which were MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4). As a comparison, MoO n and VO n catalysts were also prepared from (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and NH4VO3 with the same preparation condition, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests Selective oxidation of propane to acrolein was carried out in a tubular fixed bed flow reactor made of quartz (i.d.=6mm) under atmospheric pressure. Analysis of reactants and products were carried out by gas chromatography, using two column types: (i) Porapak Q (2.0 m×1/8 in.); (ii) molecular sieve 13Å (2 m×1/8 in.). Carbon balance was always more than 95%. The catalytic reaction condition was as follows: amount of the catalysts 100mg, feed gas molar ratio O2:C3H8=1:1, GSHV 6000h−1, and the catalysts were not reduced or diluted further prior to reaction. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Rigaku-D/max-B automated power X-ray diffractometer by the continuous scanning (4°/min) with Cu Kα radiation (45kV, 40mA). H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was carried out on the AMI-200 catalyst characterizing system, 5.0mg of catalyst was charged each time into a U-shaped quartz micro reactor (i.d.=4mm). After purged with Ar gas from 323 to 573K with ramp of 20K/min, held in 573K for 30min, cooled to 373K, the sample was reduced in a 5% H2/Ar stream (25ml/min). The reduction temperature was uniformly ranged from 373 to 1023K with ramp of 20K/min. The H2 consumption was monitored by a TCD connected to PC data station. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance The reaction results of selective oxidation from propane under different temperature were showed in Table 1 . As Table 1 showed, the reaction was greatly affected by the reaction temperature. Both conversion of propane and selectivity of acrolein were low when the temperature was less than 673K. When the reaction temperature was higher than 773K, CO and CO2 were main product and yield of acrolein was also low. The suitable temperature for the reaction was 773K. The performance of the MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n catalysts for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein was studied in the range of x value from 0 to 0.4. Conversion of propane and selectivity of products were shown in Table 2 , including the reaction results of MoO n and VO n catalysts. As Table 2 showed, the conversion of propane was very low by using MoO n catalyst (1.6%). This meant that the oxidizability of MoO n catalyst was very little. As to VO n catalyst, the major products were CO and CO2 with high conversion of propane (53.1%), while acrolein could not be detected. The performance of VO n and MoO n showed that each of them was in prejudice of the reaction of selective oxidation propane to acrolein. The catalytic performance of mixed metallic oxide MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein was obviously better than that of single-content metallic oxide, as Table 2 showed, but both the conversion (12.5%) of propane and the selectivity (33%) of acrolein were also lower when there was no phosphorus in the Mo–V–Te–O catalysts. The addition of phosphorus content greatly affected the formation of acrolein. The selectivity increased with the addition of phosphorus content and was up to 47.0% when phosphorus content was 0.15. The selectivity of acrolein decreased if phosphorus content continued increasing. Contrary with most of cases, the conversion of propane on the catalysts of Mo–V–Te–P–O did not descend while phosphorus content added, but also aggrandized from 12.5 to 46.6% with the addition of phosphorus content. Trend of the conversion was like that of the selectivity and the maximum yield of acrolein was 21.9% when phosphorus content equaled to 0.15. The major products in the selective oxidation of propane were CO and acrolein. Besides these, a small amount of acrylic acid, ethylene and CO2 were also obtained as by-products. Propene was detected in this reaction. 3.2 H2-TPR H2-TPR profiles and amount of H2 consumption of MoO n , VO n and MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n catalysts were shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3 , respectively. As Fig. 1 showed, two peaks in the H2-TPR pattern of pure MoO n showed at temperature of 948 and 995K (pattern b), corresponding to the step-wise reduction of Mo6+⇒Mo4+ and Mo4+⇒Mo0, respectively [19,20]. The TPR profile of pure VO n could be observed at temperature of 913 and 943K (pattern a). The amount of H2 consumption of VO n was larger than that of MoO n . The H2-TPR profile of MoV0.3Te0.23O was almost uniform as that of MoO n (pattern c) with two peaks situated at 945 and 991K and the peaks could mainly be ascribed to the reduction of V and Mo species. When phosphorus was added into the catalysts with x from 0.05 to 0.4, the two peaks incorporated to one and shifted to low temperature from the range of 901 to 925K (patterns d–i). The board peak became sharper and consumption of hydrogen rapidly decreased from 59 to 4 along with the addition of phosphorus increased (Table 3). Kinetic studies had confirmed that CH bond activation step using lattice oxygen limits the rate of propane oxidation dehydrogenation on V- and Mo-based catalysts [21,22]. CH bond dissociation process related with the incipient redox property of metal oxide catalysts. As we knew, the technical production of acrolein from propane was carried out in two separate steps with propylene as intermediate. Propylene could not be detected in our experiment, which implied that propylene could easily be converted to other product as soon as it was formed from propane. Suitable reducibility and oxidizability of the catalyst were needed for selective oxidation from propane to acrolein. The oxidability of MoO n was too low to oxidize propane and that of VO n was so high that the ultimate products were CO and CO2. Phosphorus content in the MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n catalysts played an important role for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein. Lower H2-TPR of the catalysts containing phosphorus content indicated that Mo6+ and V5+ species were partly reduced to low oxidation states. In selective oxidation of propane to acrolein on the catalysts, the oxygen deficient site around unsaturated Mo5+ reacted with molecular oxygen to form lattice oxygen species that were active species for propane activation; simultaneously, the unsaturated Mo5+ was oxidized to Mo6+ [23]. The enhancement of reducibility was propitious to this process. The more the lattice oxygen deficient sites, the easier the diffusion of oxygen and the reducibility of the catalysts improved with the increase of the phosphorus content. It was noted that the selectivity of acrolein greatly decreased, selectivity of CO x obviously increased and H2 consumption of the catalysts in H2-TPR experiment rapidly cut down when phosphorus content was excess (x=0.15) in the catalyst. It suggested that addition of excessive phosphorus broke up the balance of redox cycle, resulting in both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of acrolein depressing. Appropriate phosphorus content may adjust reducibility and oxidizability of the catalyst. When phosphorus content was 0.15, the catalyst materialized the best redox capability. 3.3 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of mixed metal oxide were shown in Fig. 2 . In order to compare with the Mo–V–Te–P–O catalysts, a sample of MoO n (pattern a) was measured. Its characteristic XRD peaks situated at the 2θ angles of 12.7, 23.3, 25.6, 27.3 and 38.9° which could be attributed to MoO3 (JCPDS 5-508). Although a new phase of (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14 with the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 22.1, 28.2, 36.1, 45.2 and 50.0° (JCPDS 31-1437) was detected, the major phase of Mo–V–Te–O catalyst (pattern b) was MoO3. With the diffraction intensity of the phase MoO3 decreasing, diffraction intensity of the phase (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14 was going more and more strong with the phosphorus increasing and gradually became the major phase of the catalysts after phosphorus content was more than 0.15. According to the XRD patterns of the catalysts of MoV0.3Te0.23P x O n , the addition of phosphorus could also greatly affect phases in the catalysts. When there was no phosphorus in the catalyst, the main phase was MoO3. The addition of phosphoric acid could bring on phase of (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14 and it was going more and more strong with the phosphorus increasing. The degree of crystallization of the catalysts ebbed by degrees and amorphous phase gradually emerged at the range of 2θ from 20 to 37° as the phosphorus contents above 0.2 (patterns f–h). Existence of phase (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14 in the catalyst indicated that Mo and V species exhibited two kinds of oxidation states. Combination of the H2-TPR results might be Mo5+/Mo6+ and V4+/V5+. The two kinds of electron couples could be formed by a charge transfer: V 5++O 2−⇌V 4++O − and Mo 5++O −⇌Mo 6++O 2− And synergistic reaction could be occurred in the active phase by the equation: V 5++Mo 5+⇌V 4++Mo 6+ 4 Conclusion The addition of phosphorus into the Mo–V–Te–O-based catalysts could greatly influence the formation of acrolein from partial oxidation of propane. The proper phosphorus content in the catalyst improved the reducibility, increased the relative concentration of Mo5+ species and made intensity of phase (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14 suitable, which was in favor of the formation of the redox cycle (V5++Mo5+⇌V4++Mo6+) in the catalyst. Such effect in return greatly influenced the catalytic performance in selective oxidation of propane to acroelin. When the amount of phosphorus attained 0.15, the redox ability of the Mo–V–Te–P–O catalysts was best and the yield of acrolein attained 21.9%.
