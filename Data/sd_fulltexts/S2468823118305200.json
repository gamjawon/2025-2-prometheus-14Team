China Graphical abstract The nanoparticle CoMoP as a co-catalyst can provide a large number of active sites and increase the conductivity, thereby can easily trapping electrons to reduce H2O/H+ protons on the surface of CoMoP/g-C3N4 to produce H2. In this case, a novel photocatalyst with visible light harvesting, spatial charge separation and effective electron transfer route is reported, which assemble Co-Mo-P nanoparticle on the surface of g-C3N4. The composite photocatalyst shows high H2 evolution with a yield of 646.4 μmol in 5 h, which is 66.7 times than over the pristine g-C3N4. The AQE measured was reached 5.25% at the wavelength of 475 nm after 1 h. The inner reason was comprehensively studied and understood by means of FESEM, HRTEM, XRD, XPS, UV–vis DRS and BET. Especially the investigation of their photoelectrochemical properties with photocurrent, voltammetric scanning, fluorescence spectra, etc. The characterization results show that CoMoP forms a large number of active sites on the surface of g-C3N4, which improves efficiency of the charge transfer and then accelerates the rate of HER. At the same time, the mechanism of H2 production of photocatalyst in the eosin Y sensitization system was proposed. Keywords Photocatalysis Hydrogen production Electron transfer Charge separation 1 Introduction It is inevitable that the development of society will depend more on the new energy source of H2, an ideal energy, which can replaces traditional fossil fuels because the advantages of free-pollution and high calorific value [1,2]. Generally speaking, there are many methods for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) such as traditional way of the electrolysis water, semiconductor photocatalysts or catalytic of metalloenzyme photocatalytic decomposition of water to generate H2 [3–5], etc. Those methods will be the effective ways to solve energy problems in the forthcoming years. In recent years, the semiconductor photocatalytic materials can embody their values in degrading organic pollutants, making batteries, eliminating bacteria and H2 energy storage [6], many examples are titanium dioxide (TiO2) [7], cadmium sulfide (CdS) [8], graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [9] and oxidized graphene [10]. However, these semiconductor materials show their disadvantages when they are single used. For instance, narrow band gap, poor absorption ability and the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs [11], which greatly limit its photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, in order to break through the limitations, the common methods are that catalysts embellished by co-catalysts of precious metal with gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) [11,12], etc. Whereas the materials are too expensive to use widely. The other way are to compound quantum dots catalyst and design heterojunction photocatalysts to effectively separate photogenerated electron-hole pairs and then improve the photocatalytic efficiency of HER [12–14]. In addition, the dye sensitization has been proved to be able to transfer electron from excited dye to the conduction band (CB), which is an efficient approach to promote the photocatalytic H2 production [15,16]. Many literatures have reported that as a metal-free polymer semiconductor g-C3N4, which has good visible light absorption ability (E g  = 2.7 eV), earth-abundant and cost-effective for HER [17–19]. However, pure g-C3N4 is usually restricted by imperfection such as low surface area and recombination of photogenerated electron–holes, which can hinder its photocatalytic efficiency [20]. For those matters, there are many ways to enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 for HER. Some examples are doping co-catalysts [21,22], forming conjugated polymers [23] and preparing composite materials [24], etc. Recently, a composite catalyst prepared by doping transition metal phosphide (TMP) shows a good effect for HER [26]. As a photocatalysts, TMP has been successfully synthesized to a variety of composite photocatalytic materials such as FeP, CoP, Ni2P, MoP and WP [27–31], etc. Especially, because of the good electrical conductivity, low electrical resistance and good thermal stability [32], molybdenum phosphide (MoP) is often used in the field of electrocatalysis [33] and catalytic hydrodesulfurization [34]. Cobalt phosphide (CoP) has high specific surface area and durability to improve the electrocatalytic properties, so it was recognized as a better catalyst for improving the performance for HER [35–38]. To the best of our knowledge, there were no reports about the co-catalysts CoMoP modified g-C3N4 on the photocatalytic H2 production so far. Therefore, in this article, we successfully prepared a novel catalyst Co-Mo-P/g-C3N4 by two-steps hydrothermal method for HER. The composite catalyst Co-Mo-P/g-C3N4 has exhibited excellent activity in H2 production during photocatalytic splitting of water. The results of this experiment clearly show that the bimetallic phosphide, as a cocatalyst, has unique and potential advantages for photocatalytic H2 production. In view of its efficient H2 production activity, the reaction mechanism of Co-Mo-P/g-C3N4 catalyst under the eosin Y sensitization system was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of g-C3N4 catalyst Twenty grams of urea was weighed into a 50 ml porcelain crucible and then placed into muffle furnace. The urea was calcined at a temperature of 550 °C with the temperature ramping rate of 5 °C per minute and kept for 4 h at 550 °C. The obtained yellow solid was ground into powder after cooling down to room temperature, which was the g-C3N4 for further using. 2.2 Preparation of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst Different weight ratio of cobalt acetate (Co(Ac)2·4H2O) with 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g and 0.4 g was weighed into four beakers, respectively. Then different ratio of ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) with 0.5 g, 0.4 g, 0.3 g and 0.2 g was weighed into the above mentioned beakers, respectively. The mixed solid was thoroughly triturated after adding 0.1 g g-C3N4 into the above beakers. In the end, 30 ml of ethanol solution and 1 ml of deionized water were added and sonicated for 2 h. 5 ml of ammonia aqueous (NH3·H2O) was added into the above solution after sonicated and stirred for 30 min, respectively. Then the mixture solution was transferred to an autoclave and reacted at 150 °C for 4 h. After the above reaction completed and cooled down to room temperature, each of them was washed by deionized water and ethanol twice. The samples were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 8 h after centrifuged, then ground it into powder and named it CoMoP/g-C3N4-1, -2, -3 and -4 for standby, respectively. Sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) was weighed with corresponding to the number of grams (keep the molar ratio CoMo:P = 1:5) and grinded with the above powder of CoMoP/g-C3N4-1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively. After that, the powder was put in corundum boat and calcined in tube furnace at 300 °C for 2 h. The calcined solid obtained was pulverized and then washed with deionized water and ethanol twice, then centrifuged to obtain different proportions of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts. For comparing with CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst, the parallel-like catalysts CoP/g-C3N4 and MoP/g-C3N4 were prepared in the same method as described above. 2.3 Characterization The surface morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were characterized by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) under the voltage of 5.0 kV. In order to further observe the lattice structure, the samples were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) under the voltage of 300 kV. The photoelectrochemical qualitative analysis of catalysts was measured by the princeton electrochemical workstation. The standard three-electrode system was used include the Pt slices employed as the counter electrode and the calomel reference electrode. The working electrode was made of FTO conductive glasses. The information of element composition and valence state of the sample were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 xi). The fluorescence data of the samples were coated on FTO in electrolyte of Na2SO4 solution (0.5 M) and measured by Steady State & Transient State Fluorescence Spectrofluorometer FluroMax-4P at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the composition and crystal structure of the material (tube current 40 mA and tube voltage 40 keV). Ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection was measured using UV-2550. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were characterized by Thermo Nicolet Avatar 380 FTIR spectrometer. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of samples were measured with an ASAP 2020M instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The pore size distribution plots were obtained by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. 2.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments and the AQE At first, 10 mg of the catalyst powder and 5 ml solution of eosin Y (contains 10 mg of eosin Y as the sensitizer) were added to the quartz reaction bottle (62 ml). Afterwards, 30 ml of triethanolamine (TEOA) (15 v/v%) solution as the sacrificial agent was added to the bottle and ultrasonic 20 min. To ensure the reaction system was under anaerobic conditions, the air in the quartz reaction bottle was replaced by nitrogen for 10 min. Then the reaction bottle was put into the multichannel photochemical reaction system and slightly stirring to keep the photocatalyst suspending. The H2 obtained was detected by gas chromatograph (GC7900, TCD detector) every 30 min. The apparent quantum yield (AQE) was measured with the same condition that 5 mg catalyst was weighed into quartz reaction bottle (62 ml), then 30 ml of TEOA solution (15 v/v%) and 5 mg of eosin Y were added, too. The excitation sources of different wavelengths provided by xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300) though a bandpass filter (420, 450, 475, 500, 550 and 600 nm). Incident light power was measured by an photoradiometer (PL-MW2000). The hydrogen production was measured after 1 h of reaction experiments for AQE tests. The formula as followed is to calculate the AQE [25]: AQE = 2 × n H 2 × N A n × 100 % . Among the equation, where n H 2 is the amount of H2 production per unit time, N A is Avogadro's constant (N A  = 6.02 × 1023), n represent the number of photons generated by a xenon lamp per unit time. The formula as followed is to calculate the n: n = W h × ν = P × t × λ h × c . Among the equation, where P is the output power from xenon lamp, h is Planck constant, C is lightspeed and λ is the wavelength of incident light. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 X-ray diffractometer and FTIR analysis The crystal structures of g-C3N4, MoP/g-C3N4, CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the standard PDF card was provided. As shown in Fig. 1A, the characteristic peak at 2θ = 13.2° and 2θ = 27.4° with spades corresponding to the (0 0 1) and (0 0 2) crystal plane (PDF#87-1526) are the evidence of the periodic in-plane tri-s-triazine of g-C3N4 [9]. The other diffraction peaks observed at 31.5° (0 1 1), 35.3° (2 0 0), 46.23° (1 1 2) and 52.3° (1 0 3) with diamonds can be assigned to the structure of CoP from CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts, the crystal plane corresponded can be indexed from standard cards (PDF#29-0497) [39]. It can be demonstrated that CoP was successfully synthesized upon the g-C3N4 catalyst surface. The weak diffraction peaks at 15.9° (0 2 0), 34.6° (1 1 1), 40.7° (0 2 2) (PDF#76-2363) are the structure of MoP from MoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts [36]. Meanwhile, the XRD diffraction peak of photocatalyst after reaction was measured, which shows the weak crystal structures are still observed in the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst after reactions in Fig. 1A. Taking into all account the above phenomenon, it can be assured that the crystal structure of MoP and CoP have been formed in CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst. Focusing on the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CoMoP/g-C3N4 composite catalyst in Fig. 1B, the spike appeared at 808 cm−1 is due to the skeleton vibration of triazine ring of g-C3N4. The aromatic ring structure of g-C3N4 is corresponding to the absorption band at 1240–1408 cm−1, meanwhile, the peak value at 1408–1640 cm−1 occurred is due to the typical breathing and stretching modes of CC and CN heterocycles, respectively [35,36]. In addition, the broad peak appeared at 3097 cm−1 is related to the stretching vibration of the NH residue of the CN ring and the peak appearing at 3324 cm−1 is caused by the OH vibration of the surface-adsorbed water molecule [40,41]. The characteristic peak of g-C3N4 is gradually weaken due to the introduction of CoMoP from bottom to top, however, the structure of g-C3N4 is unchanged. 3.2 Morphology and structure of catalysts With a view to observe the surface morphology of the g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 nanocatalysts, the characterization was measured by Field emmision scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) shows in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from Fig. 2A that the surface of pure g-C3N4 shows a sheet-like multi-layer structure with a relatively smooth surface. There are many irregular morphology of CoMoP nanoparticles observed on the surface of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst in Fig. 2B and the surface become roughness. Other subtle structure can be further described by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Fig. 2C, which shows that many black spots was the CoMoP successfully and unevenly dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4. The TEM image reflected that more active sites has been formed, which can improve the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst. It can be seen from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) in Fig. 2E that the lattice fringes are clearly observed with interplanar distance of 0.25 nm and 0.22 nm with red lines correspond to the CoP (1 1 2) [35] and MoP (0 2 2) [42] lattice planes, respectively. The results matched well with XRD diffraction peaks at 46.23° and 40.7°, respectively. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (inset Fig. 2C) and elemental mapping images (Fig. 2F) were further measured to confirm the elements of composite catalyst CoMoP/g-C3N4 [43]. The results indicated the coexistence and uniform dispersion of elements C, N, Co, Mo and P over the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst. In the meantime, the atomic ratio from EDX also be analyzed to confirm the elements surely existence in the photocatalyst shows in Table 1 . The results indicate that C and N are the dominated elements in catalyst, as well as Co, Mo, P is 1.47%, 1.79% and 4.11%, respectively. 3.3 Photocatalytic H2 production activity Fig. 3A shows the comparison of the amount of H2 production in TEOA aqueous solution with different weight ratios of the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst at pH 10 under visible light irradiation. The H2 production of four catalysts are increasing with different rates in 5 h. In particular, the CoMoP/g-C3N4-3 (m Co:m Mo = 0.3:0.3) excels in four catalysts with the highest H2 production (440.1 μmol). We named the best weight ratio of catalyst is CoMoP/g-C3N4 in the following article for convenience. The amount of H2 production in parallel with samples of pure g-C3N4, CoMoP, CoP/g-C3N4, MoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 at pH 7 is showed in Fig. 3B. It can be clearly seen that H2 production of CoMoP/g-C3N4 (10 mg) acquired an aggregate 646.4 μmol after 5 h, which are 66.7 times, 6.7 times, threefold and twofold than g-C3N4, MoP/g-C3N4, CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP, respectively. Comparing the photocatalysts has been done with similar composition resent time, there no reports about the co-catalysts CoMoP modified g-C3N4 so far. However, the similar composition are that single metal phosphating such as MoP-RGO nanoparticles as electrocatalysts, CoP/g-C3N4 and CoP/g-C3N4@ZIF-67 as pjotocatalysts for H2 evolution [17,30,43], etc. Bimetal phosphide such as different ratio of Mo/P on CoMoP nanoparticles as electrocatalysts and NiCoP/CdS photocatalyst for H2 evolution [26,33]. However, the photocatalitic performance especially H2 production of CoMoP/g-C3N4 are outperforms those catalysts. The H2 production of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst especially be tested in the dark experiment before turning on the light and exhibited much lower activity than the condition of visible light irradiating, which was just 1.7 μmol after 5 h. This indicated that the catalytic performance of g-C3N4 modified by CoMoP is better than the single metal phosphide under visible light irradiation because it can provide more active sites and promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In another words, it is more conducive to increase the H2 production activity under the EY sensitization system. 3.4 The effect of different pH value and the AQE Fig. 4A shows that the effect under the conditions of different pH values (5 up to 12) for HER of the same CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst. The maximum amount of H2 production is 646.4 μmol when the pH shows neutrality (pH 7). However, the H2 production was reduced to varying degrees at the other pH values especially at pH 12 (66.5 μmol). The reason of this phenomenon may be that the special structure of CoMoP can present stably in the neutral solution (pH 7), thereby providing more active sites for HER. The second reason is that the EY molecules act as sensitization can be more effectively adsorbed on the surface of the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst under neutral conditions. The EY molecules were excited to the trivalent excited state 3EY* under the visible light irradiation. Afterwards, the trivalent excited state (3EY*) molecule transports electrons to the active sites, in a split second, the reduction reaction was happened on the active sites to produce H2. The TEOA will absorb protons and thus undergo protonation when in the acidic conditions (pH 5 and 6). The result is attenuating the ability of TEOA that provide electrons for the excited dye molecules, which lead to a reduction in the H2 production activity of the photocatalyst. Simultaneously, the concentration of proton is gradually decreases under alkaline conditions, the COO− of EY and the OH on the catalyst surface exist in a deprotonated form. The phenomenon mentioned above is going to affect the adsorption of dye on the catalyst surface due to electrostatic repulsion, and then resulted in the H2 production drastically decreases [44]. Fig. 4B shows that the cycles of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst in a 15 v/v% TEOA solution with pH 7 for 20 h. To ensure an oxygen-free and hydrogen-free state in the bottle, each experiment was replaced by the N2 gas. It can be clearly seen that the first cycle and the third cycle produce twofold than the second and the fourth cycles of H2 production. The reason was that EY in the reaction flask was gradually consumed. While the color of the liquid was gradually changed from red to dark green during the second and fourth cycles. In the third cycle experiment, 10 mg of EY was added again but the photocatalyst still in the reaction system, which resulting in a rapid increase of H2 production. The reason is that Eosin Y excited to a single-excited state but the radical EY− is an unstable species, which is prone to photochemical debromination degradation reactions because lack of good electron transfer agents in the system [45,46]. Thus deteriorating or even ending hydrogen production activity. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of four cycles shows that the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst is stability and its crystal structure after reaction is exhibited in Fig. 1A. The AQE of H2 production is a determination for the study of mechanisms and kinetic processes and an significant judgement in the photocatalytic process [47]. In our study, the highest AQE of the hydrogen production reaction is 5.25% (5 mg) at the wavelength of 475 nm within 1 h as shown in Fig. 4C, which is consistent with the fact that EY is easily excited near 480 nm. Meanwhile, the wavelength near 475 nm has a strong quantum conversion and thus contributes to HER, which can be concluded from Fig. 4C. However, the quantum efficiency is gradually decreases with the wavelength increasing and it just be 0.1% at 600 nm, which shows the visible light absorption of the catalyst is greatly reduced. Thereby, we speculate that the quantum conversion rate will be close to zero after the wavelength greater than 600 nm and the long wavelength will be disadvantage for HER. 3.5 Optical properties of the photocatalysts It is an effective method to ascertain the transfer and separation capability of photocatalyts’ radiative charge by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy measurement [25]. Fig. 5 shows that the diffraction peaks of different catalysts excited by fluorescent light at 480 nm in the EY solution, while the emission peak after excited were concentrated at the wavelength of 538 nm. Normally, the more modification of metal phosphide on g-C3N4 is, the lower excitation spectrum is. Comparing with pure eosin Y and pure g-C3N4 in eosin Y solution, the excitation peak densities were reduced with different extents after phosphides loading especially CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4. Although the peak intensity they look similar but CoMoP/g-C3N4 is actually quite lower than CoP/g-C3N4 and much lower than the pure g-C3N4. It is not hard to describe that the addition of bimetallic phosphides can increase the electron transfer and separation of the catalyst, which results in the photocatalytic activity and the amount of H2 produced greatly increases. 3.6 The electrochemical characterization test For further verifies the photocurrent response properties of photo-generated electrons, the photocatalysts of g-C3N4, MoP/g-C3N4, CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 were measured by photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. Then the photo-electrochemical (PEC) IT curves and the curves of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) were obtained. It can be seen from Fig. 6A that the photo-current density of CoMoP/g-C3N4 is the highest among the four catalysts, which is attributed to the CoMoP can effectively improved the interfacial electron transfer after being carried on g-C3N4. The lowest cathodic current density and low over-potential of CoMoP/g-C3N4 demonstrates that the electron migration efficiency is higher than other three catalysts shows in Fig. 6B. It is well known that the radius of semicircle in the Nyquist plots is proportional to the charge transfer resistance, and the smaller radius is, the smaller impedance of the catalyst is [36,41]. Then the smallest radius of CoMoP/g-C3N4 significantly indicates that its impedance is the minimum in Fig. 6C. Those phenomenon from Fig. 6 further proves that CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst with lower recombination rate of charges and exhibits the best interfacial charge transport performance. Additional reveals that the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of CoMoP together with g-C3N4, which is consistent with the result of photocatalytic H2. 3.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze the valence state of the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7A contains the characteristic peaks of all elements of C, N, Co, Mo and P, which are in accordance with the results of EDX described previously. In particular, the peak located at 284.6 eV is the spectrum of C1s assigned to the CC/CC structure of g-C3N4 in Fig. 7B. The peak located at 285.7 eV can be attributed to the C-O in the g-C3N4 sheets [19]. Also the structure of sp2-hybridized species in the triazine ring (NCN/CNH2) of C was located at 287.2 eV, which is the major type of carbon in g-C3N4 [10,18]. In addition, the three separated characteristic peaks in Fig. 7(C) are the spectrum of N1s, which is amino functional groups (CNH) corresponding to the weak peak at the binding energy of 400.6 eV [18]. The broad peak is п excitations of the CN conjugated structures located at 405.2 and 404.7 eV of g-C3N4 can be credited to the charging effects or positive charge localization in the heterocycles [18,20]. More pronounced XPS diffraction peaks of Co2p3/2 at 778.7 eV as well as Co2p1/2 at 793.7 and 803.2 eV can be observed from Fig. 7(D), but the binding energy peaks at 798.1 and 781.9 eV are two shakeup satellites caused by the oxidized Co species of CoP on the surface of catalyst [30,35]. The high-resolution Mo3d peaks at 225.8 eV and 230.4 eV in Fig. 7(E) are correspond to Mo3d3/2, which is indicative of a Mo a+ specie (0 < a < 4) in MoP [17]. Another high resolution Mo3d spectra located at 233.0 eV is associated with Mo3d5/2 means that Mo6+ was formed [17,28,33]. The oxide molybdenum (MoO x ) species can be observed on the surfaces with binding energy (234, 235 and 236 eV) because MoP is easily oxidized on the surface [26,28]. In Fig. 7F, the phosphide of Mo and Co formed in CoMoP/g-C3N4 can be proved by the dual effect of P2p3/2 in the spectrum of 129.3 eV. At the same time, the characteristic peak energy of phosphorus oxide (PO4 3+) was observed at 133.4 (P2p1/2) and 125.4 eV, which is because the oxidation of phosphorus after contact with air [26,39]. It was confirmed that the co-catalyst CoMoP was successfully mounted on g-C3N4 from the above characterization. 3.8 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra Because the absorption properties for visible light of photocatalysts is seriously affected by the electron valence band structure, therefore, four catalysts were detected by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As shown in Fig. 8 , the absorption wavelength is ranging from 450 to 800 nm for visible light of four catalysts increases to varying degrees. The absorption edge of the pure g-C3N4 is 430 nm, but the absorption bands of MoP/g-C3N4, CoP/g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts are shifted to short wavelengths corresponding to 412 nm, 410 nm and 401 nm, respectively, which means blue shift has happened. The color of the catalysts gradually turns to black after CoP and MoP were attached to g-C3N4, which enhances the absorption for visible light of catalysts. As a result, the light absorption intensity of the CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst has enhanced higher than other catalysts from 400 nm to 800 nm. This indicated that CoMoP has been loaded on the g-C3N4 catalyst to help absorb visible light, which is beneficial to the activity of the catalyst to photocatalytic H2 production from water. The band gap value of catalysts can be calculated by the transformed Kubelka–Munh function in the visible region [11,48]. In Fig. 8B, it can be obviously observed that with the introduction of co-catalyst metal phosphide to modifiy g-C3N4, there is a progressively shift of the band gap values of MoP/g-C3N4, CoP/g-C3N4, CoMoP/g-C3N4 corresponding to 2.65 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.49 eV, respectively. The results can be attributed to the quantum size effect after the introduction of co-catalyst with the smaller nanostructures [18]. This phenomenon is consistent with the transient photocurrent response and the increased activity of photocatalytic H2 production. 3.9 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) characterization The N2 adsorption–desorption curves and pore size distribution curves of pure g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 are showed in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the isothermal adsorption curves of the two samples all exhibit typical H3 hysteresis loops with two different characteristics. (1) The adsorption branch resembles a reversible type II isotherm [49], which is the results of unrestricted single-molecule multilayer adsorption up to high P/P 0. There is a flat curvature in point B When at low P/P 0, which is a sign of a large overlap between the start of mono-layer coverage and multilayer adsorption. (2) The lower limit of desorption branch is usually located at the cavity induced P/P 0 [45]. They are all highly absorptive in the areas of high relative pressure indicated that the presence of stacked mesopores. The graph inserted in Fig. 9 shows the distribution of catalyst pore diameters and reflecting the mesoporous structure of the catalyst. Table 2 shows that the average pore size of pure g-C3N4 and CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalysts are 11.09 nm and 20.4 nm, respectively. This indicated that the CoMoP did not enter into the void structure or channel of g-C3N4. With the CoMoP loaded on the g-C3N4, the SBET of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst is gradually decreased from 44.21 m2 g−1 to 19.11 m2 g−1. This may caused by excessive condensing of CoP and MoP nanoparticles on the small quantity of g-C3N4. 3.10 Speculation mechanism of CoMoP/g-C3N4 Based on the above results and discussion, the H2 production mechanism of the CoMoP/g-C3N4 in the system with eosin Y as sensitization and TEOA as sacrificial agent was proposed in Fig. 10 . Under visible light irradiation, photogenerated electrons on the g-C3N4 were excited and transferred from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). At the same time, the dye EY on the surface of the catalyst absorbs photons to form 1EY* and rapidly formed the trivalent excited state 3EY* through the efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). 3EY* reductively quenches by TEOA to form EY–• in the reaction solution, meanwhile, the oxidation state of TEOA+ was formed, too. The electrons of EY–• are preferentially injected onto the CB and then the electrons migrate from the CB to the surface of CoMoP/g-C3N4 catalyst. The nanoparticle CoMoP as a co-catalyst can provide a large number of active sites and increase the conductivity. Thereby, it can easily trap electrons to reduce H2O/H+ protons on the surface of CoMoP/g-C3N4 and the reduction reaction happened to produce H2. TEOA can provide electrons for the photogenerated holes on the VB after oxidatively quenched, which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It can prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge. As a result, causing the amount of photocatalytic hydrogen production greatly increased. However, different with numerous researches had published is that during the experiment, eosin Y is gradually degraded rather than regenerated. The first reason is that after the eosin Y was excited to the excited state, it will be reduced by TEOA to generate the unstable intermediate free radical EY−•, which is prone to degradation by debromination degradation [42,43]. The second reason is that no good electron transfer agent in the system, so the electrons of the reduction quenched product of EY cannot be transferred. The consequence is that the hydrogen production activity in the cycle experiment decreased or even terminated. 4 Conclusion The composite photocatalyst CoMoP/g-C3N4 was successfully fabricated after CoMoP was loaded on g-C3N4 through a two-steps method in this paper. It exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the H2 production kinetics under visible light irradiation. The amount of H2 reached 646.4 μmol after 5 h, which was 66.7 times than that of pure g-C3N4. The AQE was measured and reached 5.25% at the wavelength of 475 nm. The morphologies, structures and crystal forms of the catalysts were characterized by FESEM, XRD, HRTEM, EDX, UV–vis DRS, XPS, BET, FTIR, transient fluorescence and electrochemistry. The characterization results supported with each other and shown that CoMoP formed a large number of active sites on the surface of g-C3N4, which improved the charge separation and transfer efficiency then accelerated the HER. From the comparison of H2 production experiment, electrochemical test and fluorescence detection, the catalyst bimetallic phosphide loaded on g-C3N4 was much higher than that single metal phosphide. At the same time, a possible mechanism was proposed for the H2 production activity of photocatalysts in the eosin Y sensitization system. Despite great efforts has been done, more works is still required to do to improve the HER a • Conversion(M.E.) ctivity of CoMoP-based catalysts via much easier routes.

        "dc:description": "In this case, a novel photocatalyst with visible light harvesting, spatial charge separation and effective electron transfer route is reported, which assemble Co-Mo-P nanoparticle on the surface of g-C3N4. The composite photocatalyst shows high H2 evolution with a yield of 646.4 μmol in 5 h, which is 66.7 times than over the pristine g-C3N4. The AQE measured was reached 5.25% at the wavelength of 475 nm after 1 h. The inner reason was comprehensively studied and understood by means of FESEM, HRTEM, XRD, XPS, UV–vis DRS and BET. Especially the investigation of their photoelectrochemical properties with photocurrent, voltammetric scanning, fluorescence spectra, etc. The characterization results show that CoMoP forms a large number of active sites on the surface of g-C3N4, which improves efficiency of the charge transfer and then accelerates the rate of HER. At the same time, the mechanism of H2 production of photocatalyst in the eosin Y sensitization system was proposed.",
