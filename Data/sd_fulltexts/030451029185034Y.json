Preparation of supported catalysts Charles G. Hill, Jr.* and James H. Wilson III** Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, 1415 Johnson Drive, Madison, WI 53706 (USA.) (Received February 16, 1990; revised January 29, 1991) Abstract Iron molybdates (mixed oxides of iron and molybdenum) are used to effect the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In the present work, Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize supported mixed iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. These supported catalysts were prepared by impregnation of silica and alumina with solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. The Raman spectroscopic studies were employed to obtain information about the influence of variations in the preparation protocol on the properties of the final catalysts. The spectra were indicative of surface enrichment of one species [(Mo03 or Fe2(Mo04)3)] and also provided evidence for catalyst-support interactions. Introduction Iron molybdates are frequently used as catalysts for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Although industry has employed this mixed metal oxide system for well over 30 years, many questions remain unanswered concerning the fundamental chemical, physical and catalytic properties of these materials. Other papers in this series address the issue of the dependence of the properties of unsupported catalysts on the nature of the particular protocol used to prepare them [ 1 ] and the results of in situ Raman studies of both supported and unsupported catalysts under reaction conditions and under conditions where they are subjected to reduction and reoxidation processes [2]. Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the influence of several preparation variables on the chemical nature of the finished catalyst and to monitor the genesis of the catalyst throughout the process of precipitation, drying and calcination. The present paper concerns the corresponding issues for iron molybdates supported on silica. Supported Fe/Mo/O catalysts are of interest in applications where the physical properties of the bulk catalyst, particularly the mechanical strength, are inappropriate for use, e.g. in fluidized beds, where the expected attrition of bulk catalysts would be unacceptably *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **Current address: Westvaco, Laurel, MD. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 58 high. Various research groups have proposed producing formaldehyde by the partial oxidation of methanol in a fluidized bed reactor [3, 4]. Fluidized bed operation has the advantage of eliminating hot spots in the reactor, thereby facilitating process control and enhancing process safety. The literature relevant to the influence of preparation variables on the properties of unsupported mixed iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts was reviewed in a companion paper [ 1 ], as was the available information relevant to the Raman spectra of catalysts containing molybdates or molybdenum trioxide as constituents. However, a brief survey of the literature pertaining to the preparation of supported Fe/Mo/O catalysts is appropriate at this point. A number of researchers have prepared and investigated the properties of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on Si02 or A1203 [3, 5-7]. These catalysts were prepared by spraying a solution of (NH4)sMo7024 - 41120, citric acid, and Fe(N03)3 - 91120 on support grains of Si02 or AI203 kept in vacuum under rotation in a Rotavapor apparatus. They were then dried at 110 C and calcined in a fluidized bed reactor in a flow of air at 360 C for 10 h. Afterwards the catalysts were calcined at 430 C for 16 h in an oven. The total amount of Fe and Mo oxides (as Fe203 and Mo03) on the support was 2.3% by weight. A different preparation procedure was used by Vaishnava et al. [8], who studied A1203 supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts using Mossbauer and Auger spectroscopy. Their samples were prepared using the incipient wetness technique. Solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium heptamolybdate were used in a double-impregnation procedure in which the component present in the greater amount was added first. The mixture was then dried overnight at 120 C and heated to 300 C for 2 h. Impregnation of the minor component was then performed. The samples were again dried at 120 C overnight before finally being calcined for 16 h at 500 C. The samples contained 8.7 mol% Mo03 + Fe203 and were characterized by atomic ratios of Mo to (Mo + Fe) from 0.05 to 0.95. The supported catalysts prepared using the approach of Cairati and coworkers [3, 5, 6] were found to possess lower activity than unsupported (bulk) iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts [4, 9 ]. Catalysts which were supported on silica gel which had been treated so as to enlarge the pores and reduce the surface area were shown to have a markedly higher activity than those supported on standard commercially available silica gel [4]. Cairati et al. [3] found that the high-temperature calcination procedure used to reduce the silica surface area gives rise to a less abrasion resistant carrier. However, they concluded that the resulting supported catalyst would still be commercially acceptable. Catalysts supported on silica gels with specific surface areas from 64 m2 g-' to 20 m2 g-' and pore radii from 212-680 A were found to have sufficient activity for use in fluidized bed operations [4]. Cairati et al. [5] reported that both activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production decreased with increasing surface area of silica. A decrease in selectivity to 59 formaldehyde (increased yield of carbon monoxide) has also been reported for iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on silica gel with narrow pores [4]. Cairati et al. also reported that there is a chemical interaction between the silica and alumina supports and the precipitated complex salt. Carbucicchio and Trifiro [7, 10] agreed that both Mo and Fe oxides react with the support. For increased surface area, not only is the surface area of the active components increased, but an increased interaction with the support also takes place. This interaction changes the nature of the catalyst, at least with respect to the electronic properties of the iron constituent [5]. Other investigators [7, 10] have also demonstrated that reactions occur between the supported active species and carriers such as silica and alumina. Carbucicchio et at. [ 11 ] also studied the effects of supporting iron/ molybdenum oxide catalysts on a- and y-alumina using diffuse reflectance, ESR and Mossbauer measurements. Fe2(Mo09)3 and Fe(III) dissolved within the lattice were detected for catalysts supported on a-alumina. For y-alumina (125 m2 g-' supported catalysts, Fe(III) dissolved within the carrier and another Fe-Mo-containing compound, which was considered to be either a surface Fe-Mo bilayer or a surface Fe -Al-Mo heteromolybdate, were found. Iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on a-alumina with a surface area of 0.5 m2 g -'were found to have a high selectivity ( - 90%) for formaldehyde and appreciable activity only at higher temperatures ( - 280 C). This behavior is similar to that of both unsupported iron molybdate and iron molybdate supported on a low surface area silica. Catalysts supported on a-alumina with a surface area of 5 m2 g-' were found to have strongly decreased selectivity (^ 80%) for formaldehyde production. In contrast to the results obtained with catalysts supported on alumina, only a slight decrease in activity and selectivity has been observed for catalysts supported on silica with moderate specific surface areas (up to 40 m2 g-') [5, 10]. Carbucicchio et at. [11] concluded that silica and alumina react in different ways with iron molybdate and that the decrease in selectivity of the catalysts when alumina is used as the support cannot be attributed simply to the increase in the porosity of the support. The decrease in selectivity must be attributed to some modification of the catalytically active species. Carbucicchio and Trifiro [7, 10] concluded that the reaction product of Fe203_M0O3 and the support (Si02 or A1203) forms a thin film and that Fe(III)-molybdate can grow only on this film. The film forms on both low and high surface area supports; however, on the former it is covered by an iron molybdate active phase which grows on the film. Therefore, the low surface area supported catalysts tend to display the same high activity and selectivity as unsupported catalysts. On high surface area supports the iron molybdate is believed to be destroyed by the reaction with the surface, thereby producing a lower activity and selectivity [ 10]. The research reported in this manuscript focuses on the use of Raman spectroscopy to explore the chemical nature of the species on the surface of the supported catalyst and the manner in which the relative populations 60 of the surface species respond to variations in the experimental protocol used to prepare those catalysts. Materials and methods Raman spectrometer The computerized Raman spectrometer system and the rotating lens assembly employed in the present study are described elsewhere [1, 12-15 j. All spectra were recorded at a resolution of 5 cm-' (365 micron slit width, 20 mm slit height) and a step size of 1.5 cm-' per datum. The collection time and the number of scans were adjusted as appropriate to obtain quality spectra. In all cases spectra were obtained using a rotating lens apparatus with the sample at ambient conditions. Material Stock solutions of molybdenum and ferric ion were prepared by dissolution of (NH4)sM007 - 420 and Fe(N03)3 . 9H20, respectively, in distilled water. All chemicals employed were reagent grade or better. The support materials employed are indicated in Table 1. General preparation procedure Supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts were prepared by the technique of impregnation to incipient wetness. In this technique just enough of the stock solution of the parent metal species is added to the support to fill the volume of the pores of the support. The resultant catalyst precursor is then dried (or dried and calcined) before another impregnation is performed. Subsequent impregnations could involve a different solution or the same solution. Because of the limited solubility of the parent species, multiple impregnations of the same solution were often needed to achieve the desired loading of the support. Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, the spectra reported in this manuscript correspond to samples dried at 70 C between impregnations and calcined at 500 C after the last impregnation. Aqueous solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate were used to impregnate one type of alumina and three different types of silica supports.

The weight percent loading of Fe2(M604)3 plus Mo03 varied from 5.2ss'o to 50ss'o. The specific surface areas and estimated loadings of Fe2(M604)3 required for monolayer coverage for the various support materials used in this study are listed in Table 1. In most cases, Baker silica gel with a specific surface area of 390 m2 g-' was used as the catalyst support. After the impregnation sequence was completed, all catalysts received a final calcination for 1 to 3 h at 500 C. Various impregnationdrying-calcination orders were used. They included: (a) molybdenum impregnation, drying; iron impregnation, drying, calcining; (b) iron impregnation, drying; molybdenum impregnation, drying, calcining; (c) molybdenum impregnation, drying, calcining; iron impregnation, drying, calcining; (d) iron impregnation, drying, calcining; molybdenum impregnation, drying, calcining. Numerous variations of the above protocol were employed. However, it should be noted that solubility considerations precluded the use of an approach in which both metals are impregnated simultaneously. Results and discussion Gal considerations Supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts were of particular interest for Raman studies because Raman spectra are relatively free of any significant contributions from support materials such as silica and alumina. Such spectra thus permit one to observe the fundamental vibrations associated with the supported molybdenum components. Due to the strong Raman spectra of the unsupported Fe/Mo/O catalysts, it was not possible to detect surface species on these samples [ 1 ]. It was hoped that due to the increased surface to volume ratio of the supported catalysts it would be possible to use Raman spectroscopy to monitor adsorbate /adsorbent interactions in situ on supported catalysts. However, with supported catalysts, the Raman scattering from surface species such as adsorbed methanol was too weak to be detected. Nonetheless, the Raman spectra of the supported catalyst systems did provide useful information concerning the effects of changes in the catalyst preparation protocol on the nature of the species present on the catalyst surface at various stages in the genesis of the catalyst. Table 2 contains a summary of the Raman band assignments reported in the literature [1, 15, 16]. The crystallographic data reported by Chen [ 17 ] were used to estimate the weight percent loading of ferric molybdate needed for monolayer coverage of the support materials used in this laboratory. Chen has characterized the crystal structure of ferric molybdate as monoclinic with a =15.707 A, b = 9.231 A, c=18.204 A, and 3= 125.25 . Each cell contains 16 Fe06 octahedra and 24 Mo04 tetrahedra which share corners, so that each oxygen atom is bound to only one Fe atom and only one Mo atom [17]. It was assumed that the pseudo-orthorhombic cells would lie on the surface in such a manner that the surface area covered would be maximized. Therefore, the b axis was 62 TABLE 2 Raman band assignments [ 11 Band or band range Assignment (cm-') Raman band assignments for iron /molybdenum, oxide catalysts and their precursors [15] 360 bending of terminal Mo=O groups 782 Mo-O-Mo vibrations in Fe2(Mo04)3 816 Mo-O-Mo vibrations in Mo03 966 Mo=O vibrations in Fe2(Mo04)3 992 Mo=O vibrations in M003 1045 N03- from ferric nitrate (appears in catalyst precursor only) Characteristic frequency ranges of vibrational modes for molybdenum oxides [16] 200-250 bridging Mo-O- deformation vibrations 310-370 bending vibrations of terminal Mo=O groups 450-650 symmetric Mo-O-Mo stretching vibrations 700-850 antisymmetric Mo-O-Mo stretching vibrations 900-1000 stretching vibrations of terminal Mo=O groups assumed to be normal to the surface. In this orientation the exposed face of each unit cell would occupy the area of a parallelogram described by a=15.707 A, c=18.204 A and 3=125.25 . The resultant area occupied per `molecule' of Fe2(M004)3 is then 5.9 x 10-'9 m2. This value, combined with a knowledge of atomic weights and the specific surface area of the support as determined from BET measurements, can be used to determine the loading necessary to obtain the equivalent of monolayer coverage. BET measurements indicated that the Baker silica gel which was used as the support for most of the supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts prepared in this laboratory had a specific surface area of 390 m2 g-'. Calculations based on the geometric considerations described above indicate that 0.65 g Fe2(Mo04)3 per g Baker silica gel would be required for a monolayer coverage. This result corresponds to a loading of 40% by weight. Table 1 contains a summary of the results of similar calculations for the various supports employed in this work. The surface area of a supported catalyst sample with a loading of 10% by weight on the Baker silica gel was found to be 270 m2 g-I. This specific surface area is 120 m2 g-' less than that of the pure Baker silica gel support. At a loading of 50% the measured specific surface area dropped to 130 ml g-1. The loss of surface area with increased loading of the support can be attributed to clogging of some of the micropore volume of the support by species containing iron and molybdenum. On several occasions we prepared supported catalysts with Fe/Mo loadings in the 50% (w/w) range. In the preparation of such samples, multiple impregnations with the Mo stock solution were required due to the limited solubility of ammonium molybdate. In this sequence of impregnations the 63 volume of liquid required to reach incipient wetness decreased by 15 to 25% between the first impregnation and the last. This result is another indication that the fine pore volume of the support was being filled by the supported solids. Only at a loading of 5096 or more did the supported catalysts have the pale green tint characteristic of bulk catalysts. This observation is consistent with calculated values for the loading of ferric molybdate necessary to achieve monolayer coverage.

Spectrum A is that of pure silica gel. Long collection times were required to obtain this spectrum because silica gel is a weak Raman scatterer. The sharp line at 220 cm-' is a plasma line from the argon ion laser. The main feature of the silica gel spectrum is a broad asymmetric band centered around 450 cm-'. Spectrum B pertains to a sample which had been impregnated with an ammonium molybdate solution and subsequently dried. The loading on the support is 7.7% by weight, taken as M003. This spectrum is also relatively weak since the broad silica band centered around 450 cm-' can still be seen. The bands in the range from 800 cm-' to 1000 cm-' are typical of polymolybdate species. Spectrum C characterizes a sample of silica gel which had been impregnated with a ferric nitrate solution and dried. The weight percent loading iron on this sample is 2.7/0, calculated as Fe203. The bands associated with the silica support are readily apparent in Spectrum C. In fact, the only peak band present in Spectrum C which cannot be attributed to the silica gel is the nitrate peak at 1045 cm-'. Spectrum D corresponds to a sample of silica gel that had been impregnated with an ammonium molybdate solution, dried, impregnated with a ferric nitrate solution and dried again. The weight percent loadings of molybdenum and iron were nearly the same as those used in Spectra B and C. This preparation results in a total weight percent loading of molybdenum and iron on the silica gel of 10%, calculated as Fe2(Mo04)3 and M003 (or Fe203 and M003). The silica gel bands are no longer readily apparent in Spectra D. This spectrum is identical to the spectrum of a bulk catalyst precursor which was observed during the course of a companion study of the Raman spectra of unsupported catalysts and their precursors [ 1 ]. As in the case of the spectrum of the unsupported catalyst, the only band in spectrum D which definitively correlates with the bands in spectra A-C is the nitrate band at 1045 cm'. Spectrum E is that of a finished iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst supported on silica gel. This supported catalyst has a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.7 and a support loading of 10% by weight. It was prepared by impregnating the silica gel support with a solution of ferric nitrate, drying at 20 C, impregnating with a solution of ammonium molybdate, drying at 20 C, and calcining at 500 C for 3 h. Spectrum E is virtually identical to that of an unsupported catalyst with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.5 (cf. Spectrum D in Fig. 9 of [ 1 ]). All of the catalysts supported on silica at weight percent loadings less than 33% were a rust red color after calcination. This result contrasts sharply with the pale yellows and greens obtained for the unsupported catalysts. An addition of concentrated ammonium hydroxide to the bulk catalysts caused them to turn a rust red color. One is tempted to conclude that the OH groups on the silica surface are responsible for the rust red color. In an attempt to eliminate the OH sites, samples of silica gel were soaked in citric, hydrochloric or nitric acid prior to impregnation with the iron and molybdenum solutions. Citric acid has been used by Cairati et al. [5] and Carbucicchio 65 [7] in their preparation of supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. In spite of these pretreatments, the catalysts prepared in this fashion still were characterized by the same rust red color. Effects of changes in the order of impregnation of a silica gel support Figure 2 illustrates 3 pairs of spectra. For each pair, the lower spectrum is that of a supported catalyst sample which was prepared by impregnation with a ferric nitrate solution followed by impregnation with an ammonium molybdate solution. The upper spectrum in each pair is that of a supported F L--\"-Xj~ 1200 000 400 RAMAN SHIFT (crti') Fig. 2. Effect of the order of impregnation on the Raman spectra of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on silica gel. All 6 samples have a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 3.0 and all are supported on Baker silica gel. They were prepared by impregnation to incipient wetness with solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate. The support loading given is the percentage of [Fez(Mo04)3+M003] by weight. This percentage loading is numerically identical to that calculated with the supported materials taken as Fez03+Mo03. (A) Loading=1046, impregnated first with Mo, then with Fe; (B) loading= 10%, impregnated first with Fe, then with Mo; (G) loading= 33%, impregnated first with Mo, then with Fe; (D) loading= 33%, impregnated first with Fe, then with Mo; (E) loading= 50%, impregnated first with Mo, then with Fe; (F) loading= 50%, impregnated first with Fe, then with Mo. 66 catalyst whose preparation was identical to that of the lower spectrum of the pair in every way except for the order of the impregnations. Spectra A and B correspond to a 109'0 (w/w) loading of catalyst, Spectra C and D correspond to 33% loading, and Spectra E and F correspond to 50/0 loading. Inspection of Fig. 2 reveals that the order of impregnation of iron and molybdenum does not significantly affect the resulting Raman spectra of the supported catalyst samples for loadings of 33% or less. However, samples with loadings of 50% by weight were found to have Raman spectra which differed markedly when the order of impregnation was changed. Both Spectra E and F display Raman bands which are characteristic of Fe2(Mo04)3 and Mo03. However, the relative intensities of the bands which are associated with Mo03 are much greater in Spectrum F than they are in Spectrum E. For sample F, the molybdenum was impregnated last. It is not unreasonable to expect to observe more Mo03 in this case. The relative intensities of the Raman bands associated with Mo03 are identical in Spectra C and D as well as in Spectra A and B. In the cases of (A and B) and (C and D), the coverages are expected to be of the order of 17 and 753/0 of a monolayer, respectively, and the probability of obscuring the contributions of an underlying species would be significantly less than at the coverages in excess of a monolayer expected for cases E and F. All six of the samples whose spectra are depicted in Fig. 2 were characterized by a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 3.0. The intensities of the Raman bands associated with Mo03 relative to those of peaks associated with Fe2(Mo04)3 in Spectra C, D and E are all typical of those one would expect to find in a bulk iron/molybdenum catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. The relative intensities of the bands in Spectra A, B and F differ widely from those one would expect for a bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. For bulk catalysts there was a good correlation between the ratios of the intensities of Mo03 peaks to those of Fe2(M004)3 peaks and the Mo/Fe atomic ratio (see [ 1 ]). However, for supported catalysts, there does not appear to be a correlation between the Mo/Fe ratio and the relative intensities of the peaks in the Raman spectra. The relative intensities of the Raman bands in Spectra A and B are typical of bulk catalysts with little or no `excess' molybdenum over that needed for the formation of stoichiometric Fe2(M604)3. Stoichiometric Fe2(Mo04)3 has a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.5. The absence of Mo03 peaks in Spectra A and B is indicative of the presence of significant catalyst-support interactions. Although the sample from which Spectrum F was obtained had a Mo/ Fe atomic ratio of 3.0, Spectrum F is consistent with the spectrum of a bulk catalyst with a higher Mo/Fe ratio. This result indicates that there was a surface enrichment of M003 for this sample.

(A) Loading=09o, pure Baker silica gel; (B) loading= 5.2%, Mo/Fe=1.7, impregnated first with Fe, then with Mo; (C) loading= 10%, Mo/Fe=3.0, impregnated first with Fe, then with Mo; (D) loading- 18%, Mo/Fe=3.0, impregnated first with Mo, then with Fe; (E) loading=33%, Mo/Fe=3.0, impregnated first with Mo, then with Fe; (F) unsupported catalyst, Mo/Fe=3.0. Spectrum F is that of an unsupported catalyst. All of these catalysts are characterized by a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 3.0. When Spectra A and B are compared, it becomes apparent that the Raman spectrum of a catalyst with a 5.2g'o loading has a weaker spectrum than that of pure silica gel. Untreated silica gel itself is a very weak Raman scatterer, but tends to fluoresce. A 5.2% loading of an Fe -Mo-O catalyst on silica gel eliminates the fluorescence. The sharp line which appears at 220 em-' in Spectra A and B is a plasma line from the argon ion laser. Spectrum B contains weak bands which correspond to those of silica gel. Spectrum B does not exhibit bands which are characteristic of Fe2(Mo04)3 or M003. The weak features in Spectrum 6s B which cannot be attributed to silica gel could indicate the presence of support-catalyst interaction products. As Spectrum C indicates, when the loading is increased to 10% by weight, the spectrum of the resultant catalyst becomes characteristic of Fe2(M004)3. At a loading of 18% (Spectrum D) the absolute Raman intensity becomes much stronger. However, the band locations and the relative intensities of the peaks do not change. Comparison of Spectra D and E reveals that at a loading of 33% the relative intensities of peaks associated with M003 increase dramatically. As the loading is increased to 33%, the Raman spectra provide evidence for the presence of a M003 phase on the support material in addition to the Fe2(M009)3 phase which is present at lower loadings. The supported catalyst samples used to obtain Spectra C, D and E in Fig. 3 were all characterized by a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. Of the three spectra, only Spectrum E provides evidence for the presence of Mo03 on the surface of the support. For samples C and D, molybdenum was present in excess of that needed to react with all of the iron to form FeAM004)3. However, Spectra C and D indicate that this `excess' molybdenum did not form M003 in these samples. The 'excess' molybdenum would have formed Mo03 if these samples had been bulk rather than supported samples [ 1 ]. These data are indicative of catalyst-support interactions in which the `excess' molybdenum is tied up by the support surface and is thus not available to form M003. Other more speculative interpretations of the data are also possible. For example, one might interpret Spectra C and D as indicating a surface enrichment of Fe2(M004)3. Comparison of the spectrum of the catalyst with the highest loading (33%) with that of a bulk catalyst with the same Mo/Fe ratio (Spectra E and F) indicates that they are extremely similar and that only minimal differences exist. This fact indicates that the estimate of the loading necessary to achieve monolayer coverage is probably a bit on the high side. Effect of changes ire the ratio of Mo/Fe A comparison of the spectra of bulk and supported Fe-Mo-O catalysts with the same Fe/Mo ratio also indicates that there is an interaction between the silica gel support and the catalyst. A typical bulk catalyst with a Mo/ Fe atomic ratio of 3.0 will have a Raman spectrum which testifies to the presence of a M003 phase in the solid. One indication of the presence of M003 is that the intensity of the M003 peak at 816 cm-' is greater than the intensity of the Fe2(Mo0q)3 peak at 782 cm-1. In a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7, the relative intensities of these two peaks are qualitatively reversed. The difference between the spectrum of a bulk catalyst with a Mo/ Fe ratio of 1.5 and one with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0 can be seen by comparing spectra A and B in Fig. 4. The absence or weakness of the Mo03 peaks in Spectrum A indicates that very little, if any, bulk M003 is present. The Mo/Fe atomic ratios of some supported catalyst samples as well as bulk catalyst samples were verified within the accuracy of measurement by ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy).

Samples C, D, E and F are supported on Baker silica gel. They were prepared by impregnation to incipient wetness with a solution of ferric nitrate, followed by impregnation with a solution of ammonium molybdate. The loading given below is the percentage of [Fe2(Mo04)3+M003] by weight.

Hence, measurement of the Mo/Fe ratio of supported catalyst samples was not generally required, since the amounts of iron and molybdenum impregnated on the support could readily be determined from a knowledge of the concentrations and amounts of the impregnating solutions employed. Auger spectroscopy was also used in an attempt to verify the Mo/Fe ratios of these supported catalysts. However, useful Auger data could not be obtained due to a charging phenomenon in the oxide samples. 70 Spectrum D in Fig. 4 is that of a supported Fe-Mo-O catalyst with a loading of 10% by weight. This catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness technique using solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate in amounts appropriate to produce a catalyst with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 3. However, Spectrum D has the appearance of a bulk catalyst spectrum with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.5. This conclusion is evidenced by comparison of Spectrum D with Spectrum A, which depicts a bulk catalyst with a Mo/ Fe ratio of 1.5. Spectrum C is that of a supported catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7 and a support loading of 10% by weight. It is practically identical to Spectrum D, which corresponds to a supported catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3 and a 10% loading by weight. The fact that M003 bands did not appear in the spectra of the supported catalysts when the Mo/Fe ratio was increased from 1.7 to 3.0 is another indication of the presence of strong catalyst-support interactions. Both Spectra E and F in Fig. 4 correspond to supported catalysts with loadings of 33% by weight. Comparison of Spectrum B, which corresponds to a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0, to Spectra E and F reveals that' both Spectra E and F have the appearance of a spectrum of a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. However, only the supported catalyst used to collect Spectrum F actually has a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. The supported catalyst sample used to obtain Spectrum E had a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7. Spectrum E is indicative of surface enrichment of M003 because the spectrum of this supported catalyst is consistent with spectra of bulk catalysts with a higher Mo/Fe ratio. Comparison of Spectra C, D and A in Fig. 4 demonstrated that supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts at a 10/0 loading have Raman spectra which are similar to that of a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.5. Spectra B, E and F indicate that iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts with 33% loadings have Raman spectra which are very similar to that of a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. The appearance of the spectra of these supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts appears to be independent of the ratio of molybdenum to iron in the supported catalyst. Our original experiments with supported Fe-Mo-O catalysts involved only catalysts with loadings of 20% or less. All of these catalysts had Raman spectra which were typical of bulk catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios of 1.5. At that time it was thought that there was a strong interaction between the supported molybdenum and the support material. It appeared that the excess molybdenum that formed M003 in the bulk catalyst was tied up by the silica gel surface in the supported catalyst and that evidence for bulk M003 on the support appeared only after there was sufficient excess Mo to saturate the silica surface. The conclusion that molybdenum was tied up by the support material is supported by the fact that Raman bands associated with M003 did not appear in the spectra of supported catalysts at low loadings but did appear at higher loadings. It is also supported by the fact that at a loading of 10% the peaks associated with M003 did not grow as the Mo/ Fe ratio of the catalyst was increased. For the bulk catalyst, an increase in 71 the Mo/Fe ratio is accompanied by an increase in the intensities of peaks associated with M003 relative to those of peaks that appear only in spectra of Fe2(Mo4)3 [ 1 ]. In later experiments it was found that at a 33'0 loading the spectrum of a supported catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7 had the appearance of that of a bulk catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. The interaction of molybdenum with the support does not explain this phenomenon. The spectrum of a supported catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7 and a loading of 33% indicates that there is more M003 present than one would expect for a catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7. If this is the case, then there must be iron left on the surface which was not used to form Fe2(M004)3. Therefore, it is possible that the iron also interacts with the support surface. However, any iron which was not used to form Fez(M004)3 could also form Fe203. Fe203 is a very weak Raman scatterer and, as such, cannot be detected by Raman spectroscopy when much stronger signals such as those from M003 or Fe2(M004)3 are present. The spectra of several of the supported catalysts presented in Figs. 2-4 are indicative of surface enrichment of one species IM003 or FeAM004)31 because the supported catalyst spectra are consistent with the spectra of unsupported catalysts characterized by different Mo/Fe ratios. For example, there is an apparent surface enrichment of Mo03 in Spectra 2F and 4E, while Spectra 2A, 2B, 3C, 3D and 4D could be interpreted as indicating a surface enrichment of Fe2(Mo09)3. The spectra could also be interpreted as providing evidence of catalyst-support interactions. Various colors (tan, yellow, green) have been used to describe the appearance of bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts [4, 18-20]. All of the bulk catalysts prepared in the course of the work described in [ 1 ] were characterized by slightly varying hues of a pale yellow-green. Of all the supported catalysts prepared in the course of this work, only the ones with the highest loadings (50% by weight) were a pale yellow-green in color. All of the supported catalysts which had loadings of less than 33ss'o had a rust red or orange tint. This tint was a darker rust red for catalyst samples with a loading of 5% than it was for catalyst samples with a loading of 10%. As the description of the color as `rust red' implies, this color is often associated with Fe203. Even though Spectra E and F in Fig. 4 are identical, the colors of the catalyst samples E and F were not the same. The sample used to obtain Spectrum F was light brown with a hint of yellow. On the other hand, the sample used to obtain Spectrum E was purple in color but also exhibited a hint of yellow. Another sample with a loading of 33% whose spectrum (shown as Spectrum E in Fig. 3) is identical to Spectra E and F was largely yellow but contained a hint of brown. This sample was prepared in exactly the same way as sample F except that the order in which molybdenum and iron were impregnated was reversed. There is strong evidence that the supported molybdenum reacts with the silica support as well as with the supported iron. It is not known if the 72 molybdenum preferentially goes into Fe2(Mo09)3 or the silica gel. When less molybdenum is added, as in the case of samples with Mo/Fe=1.7, peaks are still observed in the Raman spectrum which indicate that Fe2(Mo04)3 is the dominant phase present. However, the absolute intensities of these Raman spectra are reduced somewhat in comparison to the spectra of supported catalysts with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. It is possible that this result is an indication that less of the Fe2(Mo09)3 species is present. The rust red or orange color of all the supported catalyst samples with loadings of less than 33% by weight could indicate the presence of Fe20, which we cannot detect using Raman spectroscopy. Thus it is tempting to conclude that some of the supported molybdenum reacts with the silica support, leaving excess iron which forms Fe203. However, there is no evidence other than color for the presence of Fe203- Iron could also react with the silica support to form some Fe-Mo-Si-O compounds. Other variations in the procedure for preparing supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts were tried in order to determine their effects upon the finished catalyst. Many of these variations, such as changing the calcination time from 1 to 4 h, had no apparent effect. On the basis of a limited number of runs it appeared that calcination, as opposed to just drying, between impregnations, also had no apparent effect upon the final catalyst. However, these experiments were performed only on catalysts with loadings of 1090 or less. As was discovered in experiments involving the order of impregnation, a variation in the preparation procedure can cause a change in the final catalysts with a 50/0 loading while not having any apparent effect on a catalyst with a 10% loading. Effect of changing the nature of the silica gel The supported catalysts described above were all supported on Baker silica gel. Supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts were also prepared using BDH silica gel as the.support material. Raman spectra of the two brands of silica gel were collected. No significant differences in the spectra were found. Both silica gels had the same physical appearance. The Baker silica gel had a 40 to 140 mesh size while the BDH silica gel had a 60 to 120 mesh size. Working in our laboratory, Kovats [ 13 ] used ESCA to characterize the elemental surface compositions of the two silica gels. The only elements found on the surface other than silicon and oxygen were potassium and carbon. Baker silica gel had a slightly higher surface concentration of carbon than BDH silica gel; otherwise, the surface compositions of the two silica gels were identical. Figure 5 presents spectra for iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on both BDH and Baker silica gels. All three of the supported catalysts whose spectra are depicted in Fig. 5 had loadings of 10% by weight. Although all catalyst loadings were 10'0 (w/w), the absolute intensities of the Raman spectra of catalysts supported on BDH silica gel were 5-12 times greater than those of catalysts supported on Baker silica gel. Spectra A and B in Fig. 5 are similar in appearance. Both spectra have relative peak intensities 73 C U V r B 1200 Boo O o RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 5. Raman spectra of iron molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on BDH and Baker silica gel. The samples were prepared by impregnation to incipient wetness with a solution of ammonium molybdate followed by impregnation by a solution of ferric nitrate. All 3 samples have a support loading of 1096 by weight [Fe2(MO04)3+MO03]. (A) Mo/Fe=3.0, supported on Baker silica gel; (B) Mo/Fe=1.7, supported on BDH silica gel; (C) Mo/Fe=3.0, supported on BDH silica gel. which, in a bulk catalyst, would be characteristic of an Fe-Mo-O catalyst with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio close to 1.5. Spectrum B depicts a catalyst supported on BDH silica gel with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7, while Spectrum A corresponds to a catalyst supported on Baker silica gel with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0. The spectrum of a catalyst supported on BDH silica gel with a Mo/Fe ratio of 3.0 is shown in Fig. 5C. The Raman bands which are associated with M003 are stronger relative to those of Fe2(MOO4)3 in Spectrum C than they are in Spectrum A or B. Thus, with a 100 loading on BDH silica gel, an increase in the Mo/Fe ratio of the catalyst results in an increase in the relative intensities of peaks in the Raman spectrum which are associated 74 with M003. With Baker silica gel at a 10/0 loading, no M003 peaks appeared in the spectrum regardless of the Mo/Fe ratio. At a loading of 33%, M003 peaks appeared in the spectra of catalysts supported on Baker silica gel. However, the relative intensities of these peaks did not change when the Mo/Fe ratio was changed from 1.7 to 3.0. It was originally thought that BDH silica gel had a lower specific surface area than Baker silica gel. A lower surface area would have explained why the Raman spectra of catalysts supported on BDH silica gel exhibited bands associated with M003 at a much lower loading than did catalysts supported on Baker silica gel. However, BET surface area determinations revealed that BDH silica gel had a specific surface area of 520 m2 g-' while Baker silica gel had a specific surface area of 390 m2 g-'. Thus, the BDH silica gel has a higher specific surface area than the Baker silica gel. This result is just the opposite of that expected on the basis of the Raman spectra alone. The higher carbon content of the Baker silica gel cannot provide a rational basis for an explanation of the difference in the Raman spectra of catalysts supported on the two gels. When Baker silica gel was calcined for 3 h at 500 C in order to remove surface impurities prior to impregnation of the iron and molybdenum components, no change was detected in the Raman spectrum of the finished catalyst. These facts indicate that there is no obvious explanation for the observed difference in behavior of the two types of silica gel. It is possible, however, that differences in the concentrations of reactive hydroxyl groups present on the surfaces of the two types of silica are responsible for the observed behavior. Iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on alumina Several catalyst samples were prepared using Alon fumed alumina as a support. In order to provide a basis for comparison of alumina and silicasupported catalyst samples, several catalyst samples were prepared by the same procedure substituting Cab-O-Sil amorphous fumed silica for the fumed alumina. The fumed alumina had a much lower specific surface area than the fumed silica (see Table 1). At a given weight percent loading of catalyst, the number of monolayers of coverage of the fumed alumina is more than twice as great as that for the fumed silica. Figure 6 contains Raman spectra of four of these catalyst samples. Spectra A and B in Figure 6 correspond to 10% and 20% loadings on the fumed alumina, while Spectra C and D correspond to 10% and 2090 loadings on the fumed silica. Comparison of Spectrum A with Spectrum B reveals that as the loading on the alumina is increased, the Raman spectrum becomes more characteristic of that of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. The spectra in Fig. 6 are drawn at an arbitrary scale. However, Spectrum B was almost an order of magnitude greater in absolute intensity than Spectrum A. These same observations are also true of silica-supported catalysts. These observations indicate that in both cases there is extensive interaction of the supported catalysts with the support materials. 1200 75 D B Boo 400 KAMAN SHIFT (can) Fig. 6. Kaman spectra of iron /molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on silica and alumina. The samples were prepared by wetting Cab-O-SiI amorphous fumed silica or Alon fumed alumina with solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate. All 4 samples have a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 3.0. The loading given below is the percentage of [Fe2(Mo09)3+Mo03] by weight. (A) Alumina, loading=1095; (B) alumina, loading=204'0; (C) silica, loading=1096; (B) silica, loading = 2096. If Spectrum A, which corresponds to a sample with a lO% loading on alumina, is compared to Spectrum C, which corresponds to a sample with a 10% loading on silica, one finds that the silica-supported sample has a spectrum which is more characteristic of a bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst than the alumina-supported sample. The same conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of Spectra B and D, which were collected using supported catalyst samples with 2090 loadings of iron and molybdenum oxides. When considered in the light of the coverages equivalent to monolayers, these observations imply that the alumina support interacts with the supported catalyst much more strongly than does the silica support. 76 Other investigators [5, 7, 10] have previously postulated that reactions occur between the supported active species and carriers such as silica and alumina. Carbucicchio et al. [ 11 ] concluded that silica and alumina react in different ways with Fe2(Mo04)3. Carbucicchio and Trifiro [7, 10] also concluded that the reaction product of Fe203+MOO3 and the support (Si02 or A1203) forms a thin film and that Fe2(Mo04)3 can grow only on this film. The evidence presented in this report is in agreement with the conclusions of these researchers. The formation of Mo03 on the support surface in addition to Fe2(Mo04)3 is of interest, because most Fe -Mo-O catalysts have an excess of molybdenum with respect to that needed for the formation of Fe2(Mo04)3. The results presented in this paper show that Fe2(Mo04)3 forms on silica supports at much lower loadings than those at which M003 begins to form. Therefore, the thin film of support-active component interaction products required for the formation of Fe2(Mo04)3 on the surface must be considerably thicker prior to the formation of M003 on the surface. Conclusions Fe/Mo/O catalysts supported on silica and alumina were prepared by an incipient wetness technique using aqueous solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate as impregnating agents. Supported catalysts were prepared with Mo/Fe atomic ratios of 1.7 and 3.0 and with weight percent loadings ranging from 5.2ss'o to 50/0 (calculated as M003 + Fe203). The order of impregnation of iron and molybdenum did not affect the Raman spectra of the supported catalyst samples with loadings of 33% or less by weight. However, samples with loadings of 50% by weight had Raman spectra which differed markedly when the order of impregnation was reversed. Supported catalysts with a loading of 5.2% by weight did not display bands which are characteristic of Fe2(Mo04)3 or Mo03. This result was indicative of significant catalyst-support interactions. Catalysts with loadings of 10 to 18% by weight have spectra characteristic of stoichiometric Fe2(Mo04)3. At a loading of 33%, peaks associated with M003 also appeared in the Raman spectra of the supported catalysts. The appearance of the spectra of these supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts was independent of the ratio of molybdenum to iron in the supported catalyst. All of the supported catalysts which had loadings of less than 33% had a rust red or orange tint. When contrasted with the bulk catalysts which were characterized by slightly varying hues of a pale yellow-green, this rust red tint could be indicative of the presence of Fe203. FeO and Fe203 were found to be very weak Raman scatterers and therefore could not be detected using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of catalysts supported on silica gel were compared to spectra of catalysts supported on alumina. The spectra indicated that the alumina support interacts with the supported catalyst much more strongly than does the silica support. 77 Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by National Science Foundation Grant CPE 8410387 as well as support for James Wilson provided by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Walter B.
