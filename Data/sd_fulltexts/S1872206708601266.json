DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60126-6 SURVEY PAPER Titanium Dioxide Nanomaterials and Their Energy Applications CHEN Xiaobo* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA Abstract: Here we briefly introduce the synthesis, properties, modifications, and energy applications of titanium dioxide nanomaterials. This introduction surveys their synthetic methods (sol/sol-gel, hydro/solvo-thermal, oxidation, deposition, sonochemical, and micro- wave-assisted approaches), their structural and thermodynamic properties, their modifications (doping and sensitizing), and their applica- tions in photocatalysis, photovoltaics and solar water splitting. Key words: titanium dioxide; nanomaterial; doping; sensitizing; photocatalysis; photovoltaics; solar water splitting Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is biocompatible and environmen- tally benign and has been widely used as a pigment [1â€“3]. Manufacture of titanium dioxide pigment is a combination of two distinct processes: base pigment particle production and surface treatment, drying and milling. There are two different process routes used to extract and purify TiO2 from ore to produce core pigment particles: the sulfate process and the chloride process [4]. The sulfate process is the first commercial process for the manufacture of TiO2. Originally ilmenite is used as a raw ma- terial, but beneficiated ores with a much higher TiO2 assay have been used more recently. The ore is first dried, ground, and classified to ensure efficient sulfation by agitation with concentrated sulfuric acid. The resultant metal sulfates are dissolved in water or weak acid, and the solution is treated to ensure that only ferrous-state iron is present. The solution temperature is reduced to avoid premature hydrolysis and clarified by settling and chemical flocculation. The clear solu- tion is then further cooled to crystallize coarse ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4Â˜7H2O) which is separated from the process. The solution is evaporated to a precise composition and hydrolyzed to produce a suspension consisting predomi- nantly of clusters of colloidal hydrous titanium oxide. Pre- cipitation is carefully controlled to achieve the necessary par- ticle size, usually employing a seeding or nucleating technique. The suspension is then separated from the mother liquor and extensively washed to remove residual traces of metallic im- purities, using chelating agents if necessary. The washed sus- pension is treated with chemicals which adjust the physical texture and act as catalysts in the calcination step. This process can produce either anatase or rutile crystal forms depending on additives used prior to calcination. The feedstock for the chloride process is a mineral rutile or synthetic beneficiates containing over 90 percent TiO2. A suitable ore blend is mixed with a source of carbon and then reacted with chlorine at approximately 900 Â°C. The reaction yields titanium tetrachloride, TiCl4, and the chlorides of all the impurities present. The mixed chlorides are cooled and the low-volatile chloride impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, and chromium) are separated by condensation and removed from the gas stream with any unreacted solid starting materials. The TiCl4 vapor is condensed to a liquid, followed by fractional distillation to produce an extremely pure, colorless, mobile liquid TiCl4 intermediate product, freezing at 24 Â°C and boiling at 136 Â°C. The second critical stage in the chloride process is oxidation of the TiCl4 to TiO2 pigment particles. Pure titanium tetrachloride is reacted with oxygen in an exothermic reaction to form titanium dioxide and liberate chlorine, which is recycled to the chlorination stage. The high temperature ensures that only the rutile crystal form is produced. After cooling, the gas stream passes through a separator to collect the pigment particles and to remove adsorbed chlorine from the CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 pigment. In both processes, the raw pigment may either be dried, milled, packed, and sold or more likely, especially for rutile pigments, surface-treated to produce a range of special products for various applications. Recent enormous research efforts dedicated to TiO2 materi- als have been most fascinated with the discovery of the phe- nomenon of photocatalytic splitting of water on a TiO2 elec- trode by Fujishima et al. in 1972 [5â€“7]. An exponential growth of research activities has been seen in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the past decades [8â€“15]. TiO2 nanomaterials, including nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes, are widely investigated for various applications in photocata- lysis, photovoltaics, batteries, photonic crystals, sensors, ul- traviolet blockers, smart surface coatings, pigment, and paints [1â€“24]. Various methods, such as sol-gel, sol, hydrother- mal/solvothermal, physical/chemical vapor deposition, elec- trodeposition, etc., have been successfully used in making TiO2 nanomaterials. In the nanometer scale, new physical and chemical properties emerge and they vary with the sizes and shapes of the nanomaterials. The movement of electrons and holes in semiconductor nanomaterials is governed by the well-known quantum confinement, the transport properties related to phonons and photons are largely affected by the size and geometry of the materials, and the specific surface area and surface-to-volume ratio increase dramatically as the size of a material decreases [8â€“13]. The high surface area brought about by small particle size is beneficial to most TiO2-based devices, as it facilitates reaction/interaction between the devices and interacting media, which mainly occurs on the surface and depends on the surface area. As the size, shape, and crystal structure of TiO2 nanomaterials change, not only does surface stability vary, but the transitions between different phases of TiO2 under pressure or heat become size dependent as well. 1 Preparation methods 1.1 Sol/sol-gel methods TiO2 nanomaterials have been synthesized with the sol-gel method, a widely used method in making various ceramic materials. In a typical sol-gel process, the hydrolysis of a tita- nium alkoxide or halide precursor and subsequent condensa- tion finally lead to the formation of TiO2 inorganic framework. This process normally proceeds via an acid-catalyzed hy- drolysis step of titanium (IV) alkoxide followed by condensa- tion [25â€“27]. The development of Tiâ€“Oâ€“Ti chains through alcoxolation is favored for low content of water, with low hydrolysis rates and excess titanium alkoxide in the reaction mixture. Three-dimensional polymeric skeletons with close packing are resulted from the development of Tiâ€“Oâ€“Ti chains, since each Ti is coordinated with four O atoms. The formation of Ti(OH)4 is favored with high hydrolysis rates. The presence of a large quantity of Tiâ€“OH and insufficient development of three-dimensional polymeric skeletons lead to loosely packed first-order particles. The formation of Ti(OH)4O+H2 by the coordination of water to Ti(OH)4 is favored in the presence of a large excess of water. Closely packed first-order particles are yielded via a three-dimensionally developed gel skeleton. Tiâ€“Oâ€“Ti chains are formed in the reactions of the formed Tiâ€“O+Hâ€“H species with other Tiâ€“OH with the production of water or alcohol. The rate constant for coarsening increased with temperature due to the temperature dependence of the viscosity of the solution and the equilibrium solubility of TiO2. Secondary particles were formed by epitaxial self-assembly of primary particles at longer times and higher temperatures, and the number of primary particles per secondary particle in- creased with time. The average TiO2 nanoparticle radius in- creased linearly with time in agreement with the Lif- shitz-Slyozov-Wagner model for coarsening [26]. The sol method here refers to the non-hydrolytic sol-gel processes and usually involves the reaction of titanium chloride with a variety of different oxygen donor molecules, e.g. a metal alkoxide or an organic ether [28â€“36]. The condensation be- tween Tiâ€“Cl and Tiâ€“OR leads to the formation of Tiâ€“Oâ€“Ti bridges. The alkoxide groups can be provided by titanium alkoxides or can be formed in situ by reaction of the titanium chloride with alcohols or ethers. For a series of alkyl sub- stituents including methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and tert-butyl, the reaction rate dramatically increased with greater branching of R, while average particle sizes were relatively unaffected. Variation of R yielded a clear trend in average particle size, but without discernible trend in reaction rate. Increasing nucleo- philicity (or size) of the halide resulted in smaller anatase crystals. Average sizes ranged from 9.2 nm for TiF4 to 3.8 nm for TiI4. The amount of passivating agent influenced the chemistry [36]. Micelles and inverse micelles are commonly employed to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles in the sol and sol-gel methods [37â€“42]. In micelles, the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains of the surfactants are oriented toward the interior of the micelle, and the hydrophilic groups of the surfactants are towards with the surrounding aqueous medium. Reverse micelles are formed in nonaqueous media and the hydrophilic headgroups are di- rected toward the core of the micelles while the hydrophobic groups are directed outward. Micelles are often globular and roughly spherical in shape, but ellipsoids, cylinders, and bi- layers are also possible. The shape of a micelle is a function of the molecular geometry of its surfactant molecules and solution conditions such as surfactant concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The TiO2 nanoparticles prepared with the above micelle and reverse micelle methods normally have amorphous structure, and calcination is usually necessary in order to induce high crystallinity. However, this process usu- ally leads to the growth and agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparti- cles. The crystallinity of TiO2 nanoparticles initially (synthe- sized by controlled hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide in reverse CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 micelles in a hydrocarbon solvent) could be improved by an- nealing in the presence of the micelles at temperatures con- siderably lower than those required for the traditional calcina- tion treatment in the solid state [40]. This procedure resulted in crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles with unchanged physical di- mensions and minimal agglomeration [40]. Surfactants have been widely used in the preparation of va- riety of nanoparticles with good size distribution and dispersity [43â€“50]. Adding different surfactants as capping agents such as acetic acid and acetylacetone into the reaction matrix can help synthesize monodispersed TiO2 nanoparticles [43,44]. With the aid of surfactants, different sized and shaped TiO2 nanorods have been synthesized [46,47]. The growth of high aspect ratio anatase TiO2 nanorods could be achieved by controlled hy- drolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) in oleic acid (OA). A kinetically overdriven growth mechanism led to the growth of TiO2 nanorods instead of nanoparticles [46]. The shape of TiO2 nanocrystals could be modified by changing the surfactant concentration. For example, at low lauric acid con- centrations, bullet- and diamond-shaped nanocrystals were obtained; at higher concentrations, rod-shaped nanocrystals or a mixture of nanorods and branched nanorods were observed [49]. Ordered TiO2 nanorods, nanowire, and nanotube arrays TiO2 can be obtained by combining the sol-gel method with an anodic alumina membrane (AAM) template by dipping porous AAMs into boiled TiO2 sol followed by drying and heating processes [51], by sol-gel electrophoretic deposition of TiO2 colloidal suspensions into AAM [52], or using the sol-gel method by templating with AAM [53] and other organic compounds [54]. 1.2 Hydro/solvo-thermal methods The hydrothermal method has been widely used to prepare TiO2 nanomaterials [55â€“67]. Hydro/solvo-thermal synthesis is normally conducted in steel pressure vessels called autoclaves under controlled temperature and/or pressure with the reaction in aqueous/organic solutions. The temperature can be elevated above the boiling point of the water/organics, reaching the pressure of vapor saturation. The temperature and the amount of solution added to the autoclave largely determine the inter- nal pressure produced. The solvothermal method is almost identical to hydrothermal method except that the solvent used here is non-aqueous. However, the temperature can be ele- vated much higher than that in hydrothermal method because a variety of organic solvent with high boiling points can be chosen. The solvothermal method normally has better control than hydrothermal methods of the size, shape distributions, and the crystallinity of TiO2 nanoparticles. For example, by hydrothermal treatment of a titanium trichloride aqueous solution supersaturated with NaCl at 160 ÂºC for 2 h, TiO2 nanorods could be prepared [57]. Different surfactants or compositions can be used to tune the morphology of the resulting nanorods [58,59]. When TiO2 powders are put into a 2.5â€“20 mol/L NaOH aqueous solution and held at 20â€“110 Â°C for 20 h in an autoclave, TiO2 nanotubes are obtained [62,63]. With/without the aid of surfactants, the solvothermal method has been employed to synthesize high-quality TiO2 nanopar- ticles and nanorods [64â€“67]. For example, narrow-dispersed TiO2 nanorods could be obtained by keeping TTIP dissolved in anhydrous toluene with OA as a surfactant at 250 ÂºC for 20 h in an autoclave [66]. 1.3 Oxidation methods By oxidation of titanium metal using oxidants or under anodization, TiO2 nanomaterials can be obtained. TiO2 nano- tubes by electrochemical oxidation of titanium foil has been extensively studied [68â€“73]. For example, by anodizing tita- nium sheet under 10â€“20 V in a 0.5% hydrogen fluoride elec- trolyte solution for 10â€“30 min, aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays can be obtained. The length and diameter of the TiO2 nanotubes could be controlled over a wide range (diameter, 15â€“120 nm; length, 20 nm to 10 È�m) with the applied potential between 1 and 25 V in optimized phosphate/HF electrolytes. Crystallized TiO2 nanotubes were obtained after the anodized titanium plate was annealed at 500 Â°C for 6 h in oxygen [70]. This method normally produces large TiO2 nanotubes with diameters over 50 nm. Figure 1 shows typicl SEM and TEM images of TiO2 Fig. 1. SEM (A) and TEM (B) images of TiO2 nanotubes fabricated by the electroxidation method [73]. CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 nanotubes we fabricated by this method with HCl as etching acid [73]. Direct oxidation of a titanium metal plate with hydrogen peroxide can lead to the formation of TiO2 nanorods [74,75]. By the addition of inorganic salts of NaX (X = F , Cl , and SO42 ), the crystalline phase of TiO2 nanorods were controlled. The addition of F and SO42 helped the formation of pure anatase, while the addition of Cl favored the formation of rutile. The anions affected the precipitation rate [74]. Aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays were obtained by oxidizing titanium substrate using acetone as the oxygen source at 850 ÂºC for 90 min [76]. The oxygen source was found to play an im- portant role. Highly dense and well-aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays were formed when acetone was used as the oxygen source. Crystal-grain films were obtained with pure oxygen, and random nanofibers growing from the ledges of the TiO2 grains were produced with argon mixed with a low concentra- tion of oxygen. Large polycrystalline TiO2 grains were formed with pure oxygen, since oxygen diffusion predominated be- cause of the high oxygen concentration and the oxidation oc- curred at the Ti metal and the TiO2 interface. When acetone was used as the oxygen source, well aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays were formed when Ti cations diffused to the oxide sur- face and reacted with the adsorbed acetone species. 1.4 Deposition methods Vapor deposition refers to any process in which materials in a vapor state are condensed to form a solid phase material. Vapor deposition processes usually take place within a vacuum chamber. If no chemical reaction occurs, this process is called physical vapor deposition (PVD), otherwise it is called chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD processes, thermal energy heats the gases in the coating chamber and drives the deposition reaction. Other CVD approaches include electro- static spray hydrolysis, diffusion flame pyrolysis, thermal plasma pyrolysis, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, laser-induced pyrolysis, and ultronsic-assisted hydrolysis. In PVD, materials are first evaporated and then condensed to form a solid material. The primary PVD methods include thermal deposition, ion plating, ion implantation, sputtering, laser vaporization, and laser surface alloying. Thick crystalline TiO2 films with grain sizes below 30 nm as well as TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes below 10 nm were pre- pared by pyrolysis of TTIP in a mixed helium/oxygen atmos- phere, using liquid precursor delivery [77]. In another example, TiO2 nanorods were developed grown on fused silica substrates with a template- and catalyst-free metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) method [78]. Titanium acetylacetonate (Ti(C10H14O5)) placed on a Pyrex glass container was used as the precursor. The precursor was loaded into the low- tem- perature zone of a furnace at 200â€“230 Â°C to vaporize. The vapor was carried by a N2/O2 flow into the high-temperature zone of the furnace, and TiO2 nanostructures were grown di- rectly on bare fused silica or silicon substrates at 500â€“700 Â°C. The final crystalline phase and morphology were dependent on the reaction conditions. At 630 and 560 Â°C under a pressure of 5 Torr, single-crystalline rutile and anatase TiO2 nanorods were formed respectively; while at 535 Â°C under 3.6 Torr, anatase TiO2 nanowalls composed of well-aligned nanorods were formed. TiO2 nanowire arrays have been fabricated by a simple PVD method or thermal deposition [79â€“81]. Typically, pure Ti metal powder was loaded as the titanium source on a quartz boat in a tube furnace. The substrate was kept ~0.5 mm away from the source. The temperature was increased to 850 Â°C under an argon gas flow protection. Then the furnace chamber was pumped down to ~300 Torr and the flow rate of the argon gas was set at 100 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) and held for 3 h. After the reaction, a layer of TiO2 nanowires was obtained [79]. Alternatively, a layer of Ti nanopowders can be deposited on the substrate before the growth of TiO2 nanowires [80,81], and Au can be employed as catalyst [80]. 1.5 Sonochemical and microwave-assisted methods The sonochemical method has been applied to prepare various TiO2 nanomaterials by different groups [41,82â€“85]. Sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. Cavi- tational collapse produces intense local heating (~5 000 K), high pressures (~1 000 atm), and enormous heating and cooling rates (>109 K/s). Highly photoactive TiO2 nanoparti- cle photocatalysts with anatase and brookite phases can be obtained using the hydrolysis of titanium tetraisoproproxide in pure water or in a 1:1 EtOH-H2O solution under ultrasonic radiation [41].Arrays of TiO2 nanowhiskers with a diameter of 5 nm and nanotubes with a diameter of ~5 nm, and a length of 200â€“300 nm could be obtained by sonicating TiO2 particles in NaOH aqueous solution followed by washing with deion- ized water and dilute HNO3 aqueous solution [85]. Microwave radiation is applied to prepare various TiO2 nanomaterials [86â€“88]. A dielectric material can be processed with energy in the form of high-frequency electromagnetic waves. The principal frequencies of microwave heating are between 900 and 2 450 MHz. At lower microwave frequencies, conductive currents flowing within the material due to the movement of ionic constituents can transfer energy from the microwave field to the material. At higher frequencies, the energy absorption is primarily due to molecules with perma- nent dipole, which tend to re-orientate under the influence of a microwave electric field. This re-orientation loss mechanism originates from the inability of the polarisation to follow ex- tremely rapid reversals of the electric field, so the polarisation phasor lags the applied electric field. This ensures that the resulting current density has a component in phase with the CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 field, and therefore power is dissipated in the dielectric mate- rial. The major advantages of using microwaves for industrial processing are rapid heat transfer and volumetric and selective heating. Colloidal titania nanoparticle suspensions could be prepared within 5 to 60 min with microwave radiation, while 1 to 32 h was needed for the conventional synthesis method of forced hydrolysis at 195 Â°C [86]. TiO2 nanotubes can be syn- thesized with microwave radiation via the reaction of TiO2 crystals of anatase, rutile, or mixed phase and NaOH aqueous solution under certain microwave power [88]. Normally, the TiO2 nanotubes had the central hollow, open-ended and multi-wall structure with diameters of 8â€“12 nm and lengths up to 200â€“1000 nm [88]. 2 Properties 2.1 Structural and thermodynamic properties TiO2 has three phases of crystal structures, namely anatase, rutile, and brookite. The most commonly seen phases are ana- tase and rutile. For the bulk TiO2 material, rutile is the stable phase at high temperatures, but anatase and brookite are common in fine grained (nano-scale) natural and synthetic samples. On heating concomitant with coarsening, the fol- lowing transformations are all seen: anatase to brookite to rutile, brookite to anatase to rutile, anatase to rutile, and brookite to rutile. These transformation sequences imply very closely balanced energetics as a function of particle size. The surface enthalpies of the three polymorphs are sufficiently different that crossover in thermodynamic stability can occur under conditions that preclude coarsening, with anatase and/or brookite stable at small particle size [89,90]. In reality, the crystal structure of TiO2 nanoparticles depended largely on the preparation method [91]. For small TiO2 nanoparticles (< 50 nm), anatase seemed more stable and transformed to rutile at > 973 K. In another study, the prepared TiO2 nanoparticles had anatase and/or brookite structures, which transformed to rutile after reaching a certain particle size [89,92]. Once rutile was formed, it grew much faster than anatase. When the particle size was larger than 14 nm, rutile became more stable than anatase. A slow phase transition was observed from brookite to anatase below 1 053 K along with grain growth, a rapid brookite to anatase and anatase to rutile transformations be- tween 1 053 K and 1 123 K, and rapid grain growth of rutile above 1 123 K as the dominant phase [93]. Surface passivation had an important impact on nanocrystal morphology and phase stability [94â€“96]. The surface hydro- genation induced significant changes in the shape of rutile nanocrystals, but not in anatase, and that the size at which the phase transition might be expected increased dramatically when the under-coordinated surface titanium atoms were H-terminated. For example, for spherical particles, the cross-over point was about 2.6 nm. For clean and faceted sur- face, at low temperatures, a phase transition pointed at an average diameter of approximately 9.3â€“9.4 nm for anatase nanocrystals, the transition size decreased slightly to 8.9 nm when the surface bridging oxygens were H-terminated, and increased significantly to 23.1 nm when both the bridging oxygens and under-coordinated titanium atoms of the surface trilayer were H-terminated. Below the cross point, anatase phase was more stable than rutile phase [94]. 2.2 Electronic and optical properties The electronic structure of TiO2 has been studied by various experimental techniques, i.e. X-ray photoelectron, X-ray ab- sorption and emission spectroscopies [91,97,98]. It is well known that for nanoparticles the bandgap energy increases and the energy band becomes more discrete with decreasing size [99,100]. As the size of a semiconductor nanoparticle falls below the Bohr radius of the first excitation state or comparable to the DeBroglie wavelength of the charge carriers, the charge carriers begin to behave quantum mechanically and the charge confinement leads to a series of discrete electronic states [101]. However, there is discrepancy on this critical size, below which quantization effects are observed for TiO2 nanomaterials with indirect bandgaps. The estimated critical diameter depends critically on the effective masses of the charge carriers [102]. The excitation radii for titania particles was found between 0.75 and 1.9 nm in two studies [103,104]. The main mechanism of light absorption in pure semicon- ductors is direct interband electron transitions. This absorption is especially small in indirect semiconductors, e.g. TiO2, where the direct electron transitions between the band centers are prohibited by the crystal symmetry. Indirect electron transi- tions with momentum nonconservation at the interface can enhance the light absorption in small TiO2 crystallites [105]. This effect increases at a rough interface when the share of the interface atoms is larger. The indirect transitions are allowed due to a large dipole matrix element and a large density of states for the electron in the valence band. Considerable en- hancement of the absorption is expected in small TiO2 nanocrystals, as well as in porous and microcrystalline semi- conductors, when the share of the interface atoms is suffi- ciently large. A rapid increase in the absorption takes place at low (hÈž < Eg + Wc, Wc: width of conduction band) photon en- ergies. Electron transitions to any point in the conduction band become possible when hÈž = Eg + Wc. Further enhancement of the absorption occurs due to an increase of the electron density of states in only the valence band. The interface absorption becomes the main mechanism of light absorption for the crys- tallites that are smaller than 20 nm [105]. Due to lower di- mensionality, the band gap of TiO2 nanomaterials was larger than the band gap of bulk TiO2 [106,107]. CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 3 Modifications Many applications of TiO2 nanomaterials are closely related to their optical properties. However, the highly efficient use of TiO2 nanomaterials is sometimes prevented by the wide bandgap of TiO2. The bandgap of bulk TiO2 lies in the UV regime (3.0 eV for rutile phase and 3.2 eV for anatase phase), which is only a small fraction of the sunâ€™s energy (< 10%) [24]. Thus, one of the goals for improvement of the performance of TiO2 nanomaterials is to increase their optical activity by shifting the onset of the response from the UV to the visible region [9]. There are several ways to achieve this goal. First, doping TiO2 nanomaterials with other elements can narrow the electronic properties and thus alter the optical properties of TiO2 nanomaterials. Second, sensitizing TiO2 with other col- orful inorganic or organic compounds can improve its optical activity in the visible light region. Third, coupling collective oscillations of the electrons in the conduction band of metal nanoparticle surfaces to those in the conduction band of TiO2 nanomaterials in metal-TiO2 nanocomposites can improve the performance. In addition, the modification of TiO2 nanomaterial surface with other semiconductors can alter the charge transfer properties between TiO2 and the surrounding environment, thus improving the performance of TiO2 nanomaterials based devices. Figure 2 illustrates the modification paths in improving the properties (mainly the optical properties) of TiO2 nanomaterials. 3.1 Doping A variety of metal and nonmetal elements have been doped into TiO2 nanomaterials [108â€“132]. The preparation methods of doped TiO2 nanomaterials can be divided into three types: wet chemistry, high temperature treatment, and ion implanta- tion on TiO2 nanomaterials. The wet chemistry method usually involves hydrolysis of a titanium precursor in a mixture of water and other reagents, followed by heating. TiO2 nanopar- ticles were doped with 21 metal ions by the sol-gel method, and the presence of metal ion dopants significantly influenced the photoreactivity, charge carrier recombination rates, and inter- facial electron-transfer rates [112]. C-doped TiO2 nanomatei- rals have been obtained by heating titanium carbide [114], or by annealing TiO2 under CO gas flow at high temperatures (500â€“800 Â°C) [115], or by direct burning of a titanium metal sheet in a natural gas flame [116]. N-doped TiO2 nanomaterials have been synthesized by hydrolysis of TTIP in a water/amine mixture and the post-treatment of the TiO2 sol with amines [108] or directly from a Ti-bipyridine complex [122]. A red shift in the band gap transition or visible-light ab- sorption was observed in metal-doped TiO2 [112,133,134]. For V-, Mn-, or Fe-doped TiO2, the absorption spectra shifted to a lower energy region with an increase in the dopant concentra- tion [112,133,134]. This red shift was attributed to the charge-transfer transition between the d-electrons of the dopant and the conduction band (or valance band) of TiO2. Our recent study on the electronic properties of C-, N-, and S-doped TiO2 has revealed that compared to pure TiO2, there are more elec- tronic states above the valence band edge of TiO2 in these doped TiO2 materials (Fig. 3) using X-ray absorption, emission, and photoelectron spectroscopies [135,136]. This can explain the visible-light absorption properties of the doped TiO2 materials. Nonmetal doped TiO2 normally has color from white to yellow or even light gray, and the onset of absorption spectra red-shifted to longer wavelength [108,110,118,122,125]. In N-doped TiO2 nanomaterials, the band gap absorption onset shifted 600 nm from 380 nm of the undoped TiO2, extending the absorption up to 600 nm (Fig. 4). The optical absorption of N-doped TiO2 in the visible light region was primarily located between 400 and 500 nm, while that of oxygen-deficient TiO2 was mainly above 500 nm from their density-functional theory study [137]. The red-shift in the absorption spectra of doped- TiO2 is due to the narrowing of the band gap in the electronic structure after doping. This could increase photosensitivity of the materials, i.e. photocatalytic, photochemical, and photo- electrochemical activities, in the visible region. Fig. 2.

CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 3.2 Sensitizing Narrow bandgap semiconductors have been used as sensi- tizers to improve the optical absorption properties of TiO2 nanomaterials in the visible light region by various groups [138â€“140]. In the sensitization of a nanocrystalline TiO2 matrix by small PbS nanoparticles (< 2.5 nm), the photogenerated excess electrons could be directly injected from the PbS to the TiO2, resulting in strong photoconductance in the visible region [139]. Excitation of the sensitizer AgI on TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in a stabilization of electron-hole pairs with a lifetime well beyond 100 È�s and in electron migration from AgI to TiO2 [138]. In the sensitization of nanoporous TiO2 by CdS, PbS, Ag2S, Sb2S3, and Bi2S3, the relative positions of the energetic levels at the interface between the quantum size particles and TiO2 could be optimized for efficient charge separation by using the size quan- tization effect, and the photostability of the electrodes could be significantly enhanced by surface modification of the TiO2 nanoparticles with CdS nanoparticles [140]. When the TiO2 nanoparticle films were sensitized with Ag nanoparticles, the color of the film could be reversely switched back and forth between brownish-gray under UV light and the color of illuminating visible light due to the oxidation of Ag by O2 under visible light and reduction of Ag+ under UV light [141]. The color of the film under visible light could be tuned from green to red and white by changing the size of the Ag nanoparticles due to the plasmon-based absorption of Ag and the dielectric confinement of the TiO2 nanoparticle film matrix. The chromogenic properties of the Ag-TiO2 films could be improved by simultaneous irradiation during Ag deposition with UV and blue lights to suppress the formation of anisot- ropic Ag particles, and nonvolatilization of a color image could be achieved by removing Ag+ that was generated during the irradiation with a colored light [142]. Organic dyes have been widely employed as sensitizers for TiO2 nanomaterials to improve their optical properties. Organic dyes are usually transition metal complexes with low lying excited states, such as polypyridine complexes, phthalocyanine, and metalloporphyrins. The metal centers for the dyes include Ru(II), Zn(II), Mg(II), Fe(II), and Al(III), while the ligands include nitrogen heterocyclics with a delocalized S or aromatic ring system [143â€“146]. 4 Applications 4.1 Photocatalysis TiO2 is regarded as the most efficient and environmentally benign photocatalyst and has been most widely used for photodegradation of various pollutants [6,7,15,33]. TiO2 photocatalysts can also be used to kill bacteria, as has been carried out with E. coli suspensions [147]. The strong oxidizing power of illuminated TiO2 can be used to kill tumor cells in cancer treatment [148]. The photocatalytic reaction mecha- nisms are widely studied [6,7,15,33,149]. The principle of semiconductor photocatalytic reaction is straightforward. Upon absorption of photons with energy larger than the band gap of TiO2, electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs. These charge carriers migrate to the surface and react with the chemicals adsorbed on the surface to decompose these chemicals. This photodecomposition process usually involves one or more radicals or intermediate species such as Â˜OH, O2Ã­, H2O2, and O2, which play important roles in the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. The photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is largely controlled by: (i) the light absorption properties, e.g., light absorption spectrum and coefficient, (ii) reduction and oxidation rates on the surface by the electron and hole, and (iii) the electron-hole recombination rate. Large surface area with constant surface density of adsorbents leads to faster surface photocatalytic reaction rates. In this sense, the larger the spe- cific surface area, the higher the photocatalytic activity is. On the other hand, the surface is a defective site, therefore the larger the surface area, the faster the recombination. The higher the crystallinity, the fewer the bulk defects, and the higher the photocatalytic activity is. High temperature treatment usually improves the crystallinity of TiO2 nanomaterials, which in return can induce the aggregation of small nanoparticles and decrease of the surface area. Judging from the above general conclusions, the relation between the physical properties and the photocatalytic activities is complicated. Optimal conditions are sought by taking these considerations into account and may vary from case to case [149]. 4.1.1 First generation: pure TiO2 nanomaterials As the size of TiO2 particle decreases, the fraction of atoms located at the surface increases with higher surface area to volume ratios, which can further enhance the catalytic activity. 300 400 500 600 TiO2 nanomaterial N-TiO2 nanomaterial A bs or ba nc e (a .u .) Wavelength (nm) Fig. 4. Absorbance spectra of N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TiO2 nanoparticles. CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 The increase in the bandgap energy with decreasing nanopar- ticle size can potentially enhance the redox potential of the valence-band holes and the conduction band electrons, allow- ing photoredox reactions, which might not otherwise proceed in bulk materials, to occur readily. One disadvantage of TiO2 nanoparticles is that they can only use a small percentage of sun light for photocatalysis. Practically, there exists an optimal size for a specific photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles on hydrogenation reactions of CH3CCH with H2O increased as the diameter of the TiO2 par- ticles decreased, especially below 10 nm [99]. The dependence of the yields on the particle size arose from the differences in the chemical reactivity and not from the physical properties of these catalysts. There was an optimal size for TiO2 nanoparti- cles for maximum photocatalytic efficiency in the decomposi- tion of chloroform [150]. For example, there was an im- provement in activity when the particle size was decreased from 21 to 11 nm, but the activity decreased when the size was reduced further to 6 nm. For this particular reaction the opti- mum particle size was about 10 nm. In large TiO2 nanoparticles, bulk recombination of the charge carriers was the dominant process, which could be reduced by a decrease in particle size; as the particle size was lowered below a certain limit, surface recombination processes became dominant since most of the electrons and holes were generated close to the surface and surface recombination was faster than interfacial charge carrier transfer processes [151]. 4.1.2 Second generation: doped TiO2 nanomaterials A systematic study on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles doped with 21 transition metal elements for the oxidation of CHCl3 and the reduction of CCl4 showed that the photocatalytic activity was related to the electron configuration of the dopant ion in that dopant ions with closed electron shells had little or no effect on the activity [112,113]. Non-metal- doped TiO2 nanomaterials have been demonstrated with im- proved photocatalytic activities compared to pure TiO2 nano- materials, especially in the visible-light region [108â€“110,124, 125]. In the study of the decomposition of methylene blue using N-doped TiO2 as measured by Asahi and co-workers [125], N-doped TiO2 had much higher photocatalytic activity than pure TiO2 in the visible-light region, while displaying lower activity in the UV-light region. A nitrogen concentration dependent performance of the photocatalytic activity of the N-doped TiO2 was found in the visible region [125]. The con- centration dependent photocatalytic activity of the N-doped TiO2 was attributed to that the band structure of the N-doped TiO2 with lower nitrogen concentration (< 2%) was different from that with higher concentration [122]. The significant increase in photocatalytic activity in N-doped TiO2 nanoparti- cles was due to the Oâ€“Tiâ€“N bond formation as oxynitride during the substitutional doping process [110]. Figure 5 shows a photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue on N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TiO2 (Degussa P25). The experi- ment was monitored by the decrease in optical density at 650 nm following 790, 540, and 390 nm laser excitation after ex- citation of a 5 nl volume of a 2 mmol aqueous methylene blue solution. N-doped TiO2 nanocatalysts displayed a much higher photocatalytic activity from UV to visible-light region [108,110]. 4.2 Photovoltaics Photovoltaics based on TiO2 nanocrystalline electrodes have been widely studied on the so-called dye-sensitized nanocrys- talline solar cell (DSSC) [14,15]. The structure of a DSSC cell is illustrated in Fig. 6. At the heart of the system is a nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 film with a monolayer of the charge transfer dye attached to its surface. The film is placed in contact with a redox electrolyte or an organic hole conductor. Photoexcitation of the dye injects an electron into the conduc- tion band of TiO2. The electron can be conducted to the outer circuit to drive the load and make electric power. The original state of the dye is subsequently restored by electron donation from the electrolyte, usually an organic solvent containing a 0 2 4 6 8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Time (h) 790 nm 540 nm 390 nm O pt ic al d en si ty (a .u .)

Fig. 6. Schematic illustration of the structure of a DSSC solar cell. CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 redox system, such as the iodide/triiodide couple. The regen- eration of the sensitizer by iodide prevents the recapture of the conduction band electron by the oxidized dye. The iodide is regenerated in turn by the reduction of triiodide at the counter-electrode, the circuit being completed via electron migration through the external load. The structure and properties of the TiO2 electrodes play an important role in the performance of the DSSC. The mesopo- rosity and nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor are important not only because of the large amount of dye that can be ad- sorbed on the very large surface, but also for two additional reasons: (a) they allow the semiconductor small particles to become almost totally depleted upon immersion in the elec- trolyte (allowing for large photovoltages), and (b) the prox- imity of the electrolyte to all particles makes screening of injected electrons, and thus their transport, possible [152]. Ordered mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystalline films showed en- hanced solar conversion efficiency by about 50% compared to traditional films of the same thickness made from randomly oriented anatase nanocrystals [153]. Higher efficiencies of solar cells were achieved with TiO2 nanotube-based electrodes due to the increase in electron density in nanotube electrodes compared to P25 electrodes [154]. Nanoporous electrodes in a core-shell configuration, usually a TiO2 core coated with Al2O3 [155], MgO [156], SiO2 [157], ZrO2 [157], or Nb2O5 [158], could improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. Doped TiO2 nanomaterials also show a good promise in the application of DSSCs. For the best N-doped TiO2 electrodes, the photoinduced current due to visible light and at moderate bias increased around 200 times compared to the behavior of pure TiO2 electrodes [159]. 4.3 Solar water splitting An enormous research effort has been dedicated to the study of the properties and applications of TiO2 under light illumi- nation since the discovery of photocatalytic splitting of water on a TiO2 electrode in 1972 [5â€“7]. Photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 and O2 using TiO2 nanomaterials continues to be a dream for clean and sustainable energy sources. The principle of water splitting using a TiO2 photocatalyst can be summa- rized as follows [160]. When TiO2 absorbs light with energy larger than the band gap, electrons and holes are generated in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The photo- generated electrons and holes cause redox reactions. Water molecules are reduced by the electrons to form H2 and oxidized by the holes to form O2, leading to overall water splitting. The width of the band gap and the potentials of the conduction and valence bands are important. The bottom level of the conduc- tion band has to be more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE), while the top level of the valence band has to be more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V). The potential of the band structure of TiO2 is just the thermodynamical requirement. Other factors such as charge separation, mobility, and lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes also affect the photocatalytic properties of TiO2. These factors are strongly affected by bulk properties of the material such as crystallinity. Surface properties such as sur- face states, surface chemical groups, surface area, and active reaction sites are also important. The water splitting process in return affects the local pH environment and surface structures of the TiO2 electrode [161]. A thermodynamic and kinetic study of water splitting and competitive reactions in the pho- toelectrochemical cell showed that the overvoltage for evolu- tion of O must be minimized, which was on the order of 0.6 eV for n-TiO2 electrodes loaded with RuO2 [162]. Co-catalysts such as Pt and NiO are often loaded on the surface in order to introduce active sites for H2 evolution. Addition of carbonate salts to Pt-loaded TiO2 suspensions led to highly efficient water splitting [163]. Suitable bulk and surface properties and energy structure are demanded for photocatalysts. Figure 7 illustrates the ideal conditions for a semiconductor to perform solar photocatalytic water splitting. In this figure, it is assumed that the valence band edge (Ev) at the interface is far enough below the redox Fermi level for water oxidation (EF(H2O/O2)) and the conduc- tion band edge (Ec) is above the redox Fermi level for water reduction (EF(H2/H2O)). The light splits the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes so far that they exceed the energy dif- ference for water splitting (1.23 eV) plus the additional over- potentials (È˜), which are assumed small for hydrogen evolution but large for oxygen evolution. The quasi-Fermi levels (E*F) under light at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte must be at the right position for water oxidation and reduction. Including the energy losses in the electron-hole separation process and the internal resistance of the cell, a band gap (Eg) of 2.1 eV is the minimum for a semiconductor capable of solar water splitting. In reality, the band gap normally is wider, around 2.3 or 2.4 eV. Fig. 7. Ideal conditions for a semiconductor to perform solar photocatalytic water splitting. CHEN Xiaobo / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 839â€“851 Pure TiO2 cannot easily split water into H2 and O2 in the simple aqueous suspension system due to the fast, undesired electron-hole recombination reaction [107,164,165]. Therefore, it is important to prevent the electron-hole recombination process. A sacrificial reagent helps to control the electron-hole recombination process. Photoefficiency of the process can be improved by the addition of sacrificial reagents [164,165]. The sacrificial reagents help separation of the photoexcited elec- trons and holes. Various compounds such as methanol, ethanol, EDTA (an ethylenediaminetetraacetic derivative), Na2S, Na2SO4, or ions such as Iâ€“, IO3â€“, CNâ€“, and Fe3+ have been used as sacrificial reagents [164,166â€“168]. Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays efficiently decomposed water under UV radiation [169]. The nanotube wall thickness was a key parameter influencing the magnitude of the photoa- nodic response and the overall efficiency of the water-splitting reaction. For TiO2 nanotubes with 22 nm pore diameter and 34 nm wall thickness, upon 320â€“400 nm illumination at an intensity of 100 mW/cm2, hydrogen gas was generated at the power-time normalized rate of 960 È�mol/(hÂ·W) (24 ml/(hÂ·W)) at an overall conversion efficiency of 6.8% [169,170]. When doped with carbon, TiO2-xCx nanotube arrays showed more efficient water splitting under UV and visible-light illumination (> 420 nm) than pure TiO2 nanotube arrays [115]. Water cleavage could be induced with visible light in col- loidal solutions of Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles deposited with ultrafine Pt or RuO2 [171]. A pronounced synergistic effect in catalytic activity was noted when both RuO2 and Pt were co- deposited onto the particle. Jin et al. [172] found that Pt/B- doped TiO2 was a good system for water splitting under B4O72â€“ environment without sacrificial electron donor reagents. Ni-doped mesoporous TiO2 photocatalyst with 0.2% Pt ac- complished hydrogen evolution at nearly 125.6 È�mol/h com- pared to 81.2 È�mol/h for TiO2 P25 [173]. N- and B-doped TiO2 nanomaterials have displayed higher activity than pure TiO2 in water splitting, i.e. under visible light illumination [165,174]. C-doped TiO2 nanocrystalline film with visible light response obtained by controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame had a high water splitting performance with a total conver- sion efficiency of 11% and a maximum photoconversion effi- ciency of 8.35% when illuminated at 40 mW/cm2 [116], although there were questions about its solar-to-hydrogen conversion effi- ciency by other researchers [175â€“177]. 5 Summary The tremendous effort put into TiO2 nanomaterials has re- sulted in a rich database for their synthesis, properties, modi- fications, and applications. New properties and new applica- tions with improved performance have been seen along with the continuing breakthroughs in the synthesis and modifica- tions of TiO2 nanomaterials. These new nanomaterials dem- onstrate the size-dependent as well as shape- and structure- dependent optical, electronic, thermal, and structural properties and have continued to be highly active in photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications, an important role in the search for renewable and clean energy technologies.
