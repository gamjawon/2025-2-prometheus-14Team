The catalytic activity of Mo_o5A10.95P04 for alcohol conversion and cumene cracking/dehydrogenation reactions T. Mishra, K.M. Parida*, S.B. Rao Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar- 751013, Orissa, India Received 26 February 1997; received in revised form 7 July 1997; accepted 11 July 1997 Abstract The 2-propanol and methanol conversion over Mo.o5Alo.95P04 (M = VO, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) catalysts was studied at different temperatures and flow rates in a fixed bed catalytic reactor while cumene cracking/dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a micropulse reactor. The low acetone selectivity from 2-propanol in nitrogen and air indicated the presence of an insufficient number of weak redox sites in all samples. Among all the samples, VOAIP04 showed the highest conversion and also selectivity for olefins. Selectivity studies indicated that 2-propanol and methanol dehydration followed a combination of parallel and consecutive pathways. On all the samples, selectivity of cumene cracking product is very low. However, all the samples showed appreciable dehydrogenation activity. Participation of Brsted acid sites in the dehydration as well as cracking reactions is supported by the surface poisoning studies. A good correlation was observed between the acidity and the dehydration activity of all the samples. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Amorphous phosphates have found increasing interest as catalysts or catalyst supports in the last three decades [1]. Among these phosphates, aluminium phosphate has been studied extensively due to its high surface area, thermal stability and surface acidbase properties [2-6]. To increase its acid-base properties, the effects of anions like F- or S04- [7] or of cations such as Li, Na+, K+, Ni2+ or Fe 3+ [8-10] *Corresponding author. Fax: root @csrrlbhu.ren.nic.in +91 674 481637; E-mail: 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ~~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. I'll S0926-860X(97)00254-8 have also been studied. So also the mixed metal oxide systems such as All-03, Ti02, ZrO,,, Si02 or ZnO with AIP04 [11-13] at different ratios have been reported. Out of these AIP04-A1,,03 system showed enhanced acidity and catalytic activity. Mixed metal phosphates like CrP04-AIP04 have also been reported [ 13,14] as acid catalysts, which showed that the presence of AIP04 increased the acidic property of CrP04 catalyst. Therefore, it seems to be essential to study the effect of other transition metal phosphates on surface properties and catalytic activities of AIP04. Our earlier study showed that 5% metal phosphate of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co or Ni with AIP04 increased the acidic properties of AIP04 [15]. To understand the types of 116 T. Mishra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 115-122 acid sites present and also to compare the acid-base and redox properties of all the samples, we have studied the alcohol and cumene conversion reactions in this paper. The conversion of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols to olefins and/or carbonyl compounds on acidic and basic catalysts has been studied extensively [ 16-20]. Acidic sites favour the dehydration products, whereas the dehydrogenation is preferred in presence of basic or redox sites. As 2-propanol can undergo both dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions depending on the acid or basic sites, it can be used as a probe reaction to characterise both acidic and basic catalyst [17]. Usually 2-propanol dehydrates to propene over acidic catalyst and dehydrogenates to acetone over basic catalyst. But according to Lahousse et al. [21], 2-propanol dehydrogenation requires an additional redox ability of the catalyst, since the same reaction does not take place on well-known basic oxides, such as magnesium oxide and magnesium aluminates. The dehydrogenation reaction also depends on the reaction environment (neutral or air/OZ) of the catalyst [22]. On the other hand, Kanazirer et al. [23] found that the selective conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether can be used to estimate the acid sites of a catalyst. So also cumene cracking/ dehydrogenation reaction is used to estimate both Lewis and Brsted acid sites of a catalyst [24-26] from the product selectivities. The present paper deals with the studies on 2-propanol, methanol and cumene conversion reactions using transition metal-promoted AIP04 catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Material preparation Samples (Mo_o5AIo.95PO4) were prepared from aqueous solutions of aluminium nitrate, metal nitrate (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) and phosphoric acid in the ratio of 0.95 : 0.05 : 1.0, using 1 : 1 ammonia as the precipitating agent at pH 7.5. Thus the gel obtained in a stirring condition at room temperature was filtered, washed and dispersed in isopropanol for 2 h, followed by filtration. Then the dried (383 K) samples were powdered and calcined at different temperatures for 5 h and these were kept in the desiccator for further use. Detailed methods of preparation and characterisation of all the samples were reported earlier [15]. 2.2. Textural properties XRD patterns of all the samples calcined at different temperatures were recorded on a Philips (model 1710) semiautomatic X-ray diffractometer using CuKn radiation with a scanning speed of 2 degree/min. The BET surface area, average pore diameter and pore volume were measured from NZ adsorptiondesorption isotherms obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Quantasorb (Quantachrome, USA). Prior to adsorption-de sorption measurements all the samples were degassed at 393 K and 10-4 torr for 5 h. Surface acidity and basicity were measured by adsorption of organic bases such as pyridine (PY, pKa = 5.3), morpholine (MP, pKa = 8.33), piperidine (PP, pKa = 11.1) and acidic substrates like acrylic acid (AA, pKa = 4.2), phenol (PH, pKa = 9.9), respectively, by spectrophotometric methods [15,27]. Redox properties (one electron donor and one electron acceptor) were determined by the same method using meta dinitrobenzene (MDNB, electron affinity, EA = 2.21 eV) and phenothiazine (PNTZ, ionisation energy, IE = 7.13 eV) as the adsorbates. The detailed procedure was reported earlier [15]. 2.3. Catalytic activity Catalytic activities of Mo.o5AIo.95PO4 samples for dehydration/dehydrogenation of 2-propanol and methanol were studied using a fixed bed catalytic reactor (10 mm i.d.) with on-line GC. Prior to the reaction, catalysts (0.5 g) were heated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 773 K for 1 h. The conversion of 2propanol was studied in the temperature range of 423 to 573 K, whereas the methanol reaction was tested within 523 to 773 K. Alcohol was quantitatively supplied to the reactor from a continuous microfeeder (Orion, U.S.A) through a vapouriser using nitrogen or air as the carrier gas (flow rate 70-90 ml/min). To avoid condensation of alcohol and liquid products in T. Mishra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 115-122 the apparatus, all the connections from reactor to Gas Chromatograph were heated around 393 K by a heating tape. The reaction products were analysed by means of GC (CIC, India) in FID mode using Porapak T and Q columns. The rates of alcohol conversion were calculated under steady-state conditions by applying the equation: X = r(W/F) where r is the rate of reaction, W the weight of the catalyst, X the percentage of conversion and F the flow rate of the reactant. The extent of conversion was maintained within 20 mol% for calculation of reaction rates. Rates were calculated from the slopes of the straight lines obtained by plotting X vs. F-t and the reaction was found to follow first-order kinetic. Cumene cracking/dehydrogenation reactions were carried out in a micro pulse reactor (Sigma, India) using nitrogen as the carrier gas (30-45 ml/min) in the temperature range of 673 to 873 K. All the catalysts (0.2 g) were activated at 773 K for 1 h in nitrogen stream before reaction. The volume of one cumene pulse was maintained at 1 Etl (7.2 mmol). All the products were analysed by the GC on line with the micro reactor using 10 ft SS column with 10% TCEP. Reaction rates were calculated using the BassettHabgood equation for first-order kinetic processes [28]. 117 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Textural properties Chemical analysis showed that (AI+M)/P04 ratios in all the samples are nearly 1.0/0.95, which are due to incomplete precipitation of phosphates [15]. XRD patterns of all the samples suggest the amorphous character of all the samples below 873 K calcination, which converted to crystalline at 1073 K [15]. The BET surface area, average pore diameter and pore volumes calculated from nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms are presented in Table 1. Surface area of all the samples remained within a narrow range. However, there is an increase in average pore diameter and total pore volume due to the transition metal promotion. Amounts of surface acid, basic and redox sites measured by spectrophotometric method are presented in Table 2. Among all the promoted samples, surface acidity is highest and lowest on VOAIP04 and AIP04, respectively. However, all the samples have very few number of redox sites. According to our earlier report [ 15], all the samples promoted by transition metal calcined at 873 K possess high surface area, pore volume and surface acid-base sites. Therefore, in this study only the catalysts calcined at 873 K were used. In[l/(1 -X,)] =RTr(W/F) (2) 3.2.

Although all the samples posses substantial amounts of basic sites, acetone selectivity is very low. Acetone selectivity increases only up to 15 mol% when the same reaction is performed in presence of air. Probably this is due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of redox sites. From the Table 3, it is clear that the rate of acetone formation increases due to the presence of transition metal phosphates with pure AIP04. Among all the catalysts, acetone selectivity is the lowest over AIP04. Although the rate of acetone formation varies from catalyst to catalyst, activation energy remains within a small range Table 3 Rate (r) and activation energy (E;,) for the 2-propanol conversion to acetone over M(j5A195P04 (29.1-25.2 kcal/mol). This indicates that the different transition metal promoters only increase or decrease the number of available reactive sites on the catalysts. It is seen from the Arrhenius plots that the dehydration activity of 2-propanol increases over all the promoted samples, though the increase is very low on FeAIP04 and CoAlP04. Among all the catalysts, VOAIP04 shows highest rate of propene formation (Table 4). The increase in the rate of propene formation can be correlated to the increase in the number of active sites of the catalysts. Probably iron phosphate and cobalt phosphate are not able to increase the number of acid sites when mixed with pure AIP04.

Correlation plot between total surface acidity and the rate of propene formation at 448 K. A linear relation between the rate of propene formation and the total acidity of the catalyst is also observed in Fig. 1. It is well observed that the activation energy for propene formation remains nearly the same for all the catalysts, which again would justify that the addition of transition metal phosphate to the pure AIP04 does not affect the nature of the active sites available on the pure A1P04. Rather it only increases the number of active sites, thus increasing the dehydration activity. Generally alcohols dehydrate on acid sites to give ether and olefins. Of course, the selectivity to a particular product is determined by alcohol structure (primary, secondary), reaction temperature and surface acidity of the catalyst. As the basicity of 2propanol is higher than the primary alcohols, so it can give olefin as a major product even on weak acid sites, whereas methanol dehydrates to olefins only on strong acid sites. Therefore, to differentiate between the weak and strong acid sites of the catalyst, methanol conversion was carried out on all the samples. Methanol dehydration gave three types of products (Fig. 2). DME and CZ olefins are the dehydration products, whereas CO and CH4 are the decomposition product of DME [29]. It is evident that VOAIP04 produces the highest decomposition product (CO + CH4), whereas pure AIP04 shows lowest in the series. It was reported earlier that the coordinately unsaturated Al atoms in 119 L90 80 70 Fig. 2. Selectivity of different products from methanol conversion reaction at 723 K over Mo.oSAlo.95PO,r catalysts. Number refers to samples (cf. Table 1). octahedral coordination in A1203 phase can serve as the active site for decomposition of DME [30]. Of course, in this case the role of a particular transition metal ion cannot be ruled out, as CO + CH4 selectivity is higher for all the promoted samples in comparison to the pure A1P04. But at this stage it is difficult to conclude the exact role played by transition metal ions in the decomposition reactions. It is seen from Fig. 2, that in all the cases dimethyl ether (DME) is the predominant product. Among all the samples, VOAIP04 shows highest selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons (16 mol%). But as a whole, all the samples show low selectivity towards the CZ hydrocarbons which indicates that the strengths of the major acid sites are not enough for the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons. Selectivity of the products in both the reactions are represented by their corresponding optimum performance envelope (OPE) curves. These are obtained by plotting the fractional conversion (X) of a particular product against the total conversion (Xr). This is obtained by varying catalyst to alcohol ratio (w/w) as described by Ko and Wojciechowski [31 ]. The OPE curves represent the conversion selectivity behaviour of active sites present on a catalyst and whose slope at the origin represents the initial selectivity for those products. For obtaining the product distribution as a 120 T.

OPE curve for methanol conversion to dimethyl ether (DME) and C; hydrocarbons at 573 K. function of the conversion, we have included experiments performed by varying the weight of the catalyst, so that conversion as high as 40-50 mol% can be achieved. However, for the kinetic analysis only the conversion data between 2 to 20 mol% were used. The product profiles for 2-propanol dehydration on VOA1P04 show only one product (propene) but for methanol reaction (Fig. 3) on the same catalyst show two types of products (DME and C.; hydrocarbons). But within 405 mol% conversion the decomposition product is negligible. Both DME and CZ are present from the onset of the reaction, which indicates Table 5 Cumene conversion over M(,SAh,.95P04 at various reaction temperatures that both of these are primary dehydration products. The downward deviation in the case of DME plot indicates the instability of the product. It means that DME further dehydrates to CZ hydrocarbons in a secondary reaction. All other catalysts also show nearly similar behaviour. Thus the pathway for the formation of Cz hydrocarbons on Mo.osAlO.ysP04 catalysts is a combination of parallel and consecutive (primary and secondary) reactions. 3.2.2. Cumene cracking/dehydrogenation Generally, cumene conversion gives cracking as well as dehydrogenation products on acidic catalysts. Benzene and propene are the cracking products, whereas a-methylstyrene is a dehydrogenation product. Table 5 shows that cv-methylstyrene is the major product over all the samples whereas benzene selectivity is very low. Among all the samples, VOA1P04 and CrAlP04 show nearly 8-9% cracking products at 873 K reaction temperature. However, on pure AIP04, cracking activity is nearly zero. This low cracking activity is may be due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of Brsted acid sites or owing to the unavailability of Lewis basic sites [32]. On all the catalysts, dehydrogenation activity increases with the reaction temperature. This means that all the transition metal-promoted catalysts possess higher number of Lewis sites. Among all the promoted samples, VOA1P04 showed the highest rate of reaction while FeA1P04 shows the lowest (Table 5). Probably the increase in acidifies in case of Mo.osAlo.9sP04 catalysts is mainly due to the increase in number of Lewis acid sites which facilitates the dehydrogenation reac- Catalysts 106 r (mol/g s) of a-MS formation at Eat 773 K Selectivity ( at 873 K 673 773 873 K (kcal/mol) BEN b (r-MS'' AIP04 10.5 46.6 121.2 23.310.8 0 100 VOA1POd 53.5 144.3 236.6 16.810.5 8.9 91.0 CrAIPO.r 53.5 133.8 210.2 l6.7.3 8.0 92.0 MnA1P04 31.7 93.6 179.4 21.S.2 4.8 95.0 FeA1P04 10.5 61.0 138.2 19.O.2 1.2 98.7 CoA1P04 21.0 75.0 147.2 18.410.4 1.6 98.4 NiA1P04 42.5 118.2 194.6 1 2f0.3 6.5 93.5 ' a-Methylstyrene. n Benzene.

Further it is observed that the activation energy remains within a small range irrespective of the variation in the rate of a-methylstyrene formation. This indicates that the nature of active sites of all the samples are nearly the same. In the OPE plot both the lines (corresponding to benzene and a-methylstyrene) are straight without any deviation, which indicates the formation of both the products from the on set of the reaction. Therefore, both of these are stable primary products. 3.2.3. Poisoning studies The poisoning of the active sites of M0.05A1o.95P04 catalysts in the 2-propanol conversion reaction was performed by presaturation of the acid sites with pyridine (PY) and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (DMPY). The catalysts were saturated with the probe reactant in the nitrogen stream. Then the catalyst bed was flushed with nitrogen at 523 K for 45 min to remove the unreacted base from the catalyst surface. In this way pyridine is bonded to both Brsted and Lewis acid sites [33,34] whereas DMPY is only bonded to the Brsted acid sites [33-35]. It is seen from Table 6 that on all the catalysts the decrease in the rate of propene formation is up to 55% due to PY adsorption, while the decrease is about 65% by DMPY adsorption. This difference in the poisoning effect of PY and DMPY is due to the differences in their pka values. But the dehydrogenation activity practically does not change due to the poisoning effect. As DMPY preferentially adsorbs on Brsted acid sites, so the decrease in dehydration activity shows that 2-propanol dehydration mainly occurs on Brsted acid sites, thus strengthening the carbenium ion mechanism. On the other hand, cumene cracking activities of all the catalysts became nearly zero due to DMPY adsorption. However, dehydrogenation activity remains the same for DMPY adsorption. But the decrease in the rate of dehydrogenation is up to 60% due to pyridine adsorption. This decrease is probably due to the poisoning of Lewis acid sites. 4. Conclusions Methanol, 2-propanol and cumene conversions on Mo.o5Alo.95PO4 catalysts increases as a function of surface acidity. Among all the samples, VOAIP04 showed the highest alcohol conversion as well as selectivity towards hydrocarbon formation. 2-Propanol conversion to acetone in air confirms the presence of weak redox sites in all the metal-promoted catalysts. All the promoted catalysts show better selectivity for a-methylstyrene in cumene conversion reaction. The selectivity study showed that alcohol dehydration on MAIP04 is a combination of parallel and consecutive reactions. Further poisoning study showed that mostly alcohol dehydration and cumene cracking takes place on the Brsted acid sites. Though the acidity of the AIP04 increased in the presence of transition metal phosphates, it is not enough to dehydrate methanol preferentially to hydrocarbons and also for cumene cracking reaction. Therefore, the increase in acidity of all the 122 T. Mishra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 115-122 samples is probably due to the increase in Lewis acid sites.

Rao Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar-751013, Orissa, India * Corresponding author. Fax: +91 674 481637 The 2-propanol and methanol conversion over M0.05Al0.95PO4 (M = VO, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) catalysts was studied at different temperatures and flow rates in a fixed bed catalytic reactor while cumene cracking/dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a micropulse reactor. The low acetone selectivity from 2-propanol in nitrogen and air indicated the presence of an insufficient number of weak redox sites in all samples. Among all the samples, VOAlPO4 showed the highest conversion and also selectivity for olefins. Selectivity studies indicated that 2-propanol and methanol dehydration followed a combination of parallel and consecutive pathways. On all the samples, selectivity of cumene cracking product is very low. However, all the samples showed appreciable dehydrogenation activity. Participation of Brønsted acid sites in the dehydration as well as cracking reactions is supported by the surface poisoning studies. A good correlation was observed between the acidity and the dehydration activity of all the samples.
