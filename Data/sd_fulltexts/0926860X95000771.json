The surface area is directly related to the amount of sulfur (sulfate) incorporated into the catalyst. Compared to the usual method, consisting of 'percolation' of zirconium oxide with sulfuric acid, or immersion of the oxide into a large excess of acid followed by filtration or decanting, the modified procedure leads to a material of similar surface area and of similar catalytic activity for the isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane at 65. The controlled impregnation tech- nique allows variation of the sulfur content without a change in the calcination temperature. In addition, no waste sulfuric acid is generated in the modified process. Keywords: Catalyst preparation (impregnation); Impregnation; lsomerization; Methylcyclopentane; Sulfate; Zirconia 1. Introduction The study of sulfated metal oxides, first reported in 1976 [ 1,2], has become an active area of research because of the high catalytic activity for carbocationic reactions manifested by such compositions [3-13]. The significantly higher activ- ity over that of the untreated metal oxides has been ascribed to the presence of sulfur(VI) species. It was shown that the surface of the activated oxides is modified by sulfate ions [ 14-18]; the sulfate groups were described as covalently bonded to the metal oxide lattice [ 7,15-17 ]. One representation of structure showed each sulfur atom connected to the lattice through two tricoordinated oxygen atoms, a * Corresponding author, Tel. ( + 1-412) 6247449, fax.

Li /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 97-105 rather peculiar bonding scheme [ 15,16]; a four-membered cyclic structure was also proposed [ 17]. Another structural model presented the sulfur bonded to three metal atoms by S-O-M bonds, and indicated that BrCnsted acidity is generated by cleavage of one of these bonds by water and formation of an (M-O) 2S ( =O)-OH group [19,20], which implies that the oxidation level of sulfur would be S(V). The catalytic activity of these materials depends upon the sulfur content. Accord- ing to some authors, the curve correlating the activity with the sulfur content exhibits a maximum, but deviations observed for some points indicate that other factors would also play a role [21 ]. Other studies, however, contested this type of depend- ence [22,23]. It was also indicated that as the sulfur loading increases, structures with S-O-S bonds, similar to pyrosulfuric or higher polysulfuric acids may exist on the surface [ 20,24,25 ]. Therefore, in order to control the structure and activity of these catalysts it is highly desirable that the amount of sulfate ions deposited on the surface be controlled in the preparation. A standard procedure for preparing sulfated metal oxides is filtration of dilute sulfuric acid through a bed of metal hydroxide [ 3-13 ] or pre-calcined metal oxide [ 26]. Alternatively, the hydroxide [ 27-29 ] or oxide [ 30] is covered with the acid for a certain time, after which the acid is decanted or filtered. Less frequently, precipitation of the metal hydroxide from a sulfate salt and only partial elimination of sulfate by washing is employed [31,32]. Use of ammonium sulfate instead of sulfuric acid was also reported [ 3,15,16,30-33 ], leading sometimes to lower activ- ity [ 13,31-33]. A common feature of all the preparation procedures mentioned is that the solid adsorbs an undetermined (and most often unreported) amount of sulfate from the excess it is exposed to. Some control of sulfate loading can be achieved by changing the calcination temperature [ 21-23], but other properties, notably crystallinity and surface area are also obviously affected. Alternatively, changing the concentration of the acid solution used in the impregnation step was suggested as a means of changing the ultimate sulfur loading [ 21 ], but working supposedly under the same conditions, experiments in another laboratory [22,23] did not result in the loading levels reported previously [21]. Thus, for samples calcined at 600 for 3 h, impregnation with 0.25 M HzSO4 gave 2.95 [21] and 1.51% S [23], whereas impregnation with 0.5 M H2SO4 gave 4.00 and 2.71% (or 1.56% for a material on which Pt was deposited after sulfation), respectively. Still another study reported that 'percolation' with sulfuric acid of concentrations varying from 0.05 M to 2 M led to about the same amount of sulfate in the catalyst after calcination [33 ]. The main problem in our opinion is that the procedure is inherently difficult to be expressed in sufficiently precise terms to be reproduced even by different workers in the same laboratory. Thus, the time needed for a solution to pass through the solid and the amount of liquid retained depend upon the type of filter (frit [23] or paper [ 3-10] ) and its porosity, upon the quantity of solid, and upon the size and size distribution of particles. As for adsorption in a beaker followed by decanting, the amount of liquid left in the vessel after decanting from a solid normally differs D. F6rca~iu, J.Q. Li /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 97-105 99 for different operators. One is inclined to conclude that there is some 'art' involved, which can be mastered only by trial and error. The relatively large excess of sulfuric acid used in the standard impregnation techniques constitutes another difficulty, because the acid decanted or filtered does not have the same concentration as the original acid and may also dissolve some cations present in the catalyst or previously deposited on it [ 11,30] and, therefore, cannot be reused as such for the preparation of the next batch of catalyst. Its purification or disposal will constitute a debit for any practical process employing these catalysts. An alternative procedure is to deposit a well-controlled amount of acid onto the surface by covering with an aqueous solution of the acid and to evaporate the solvent. One could then establish a correlation between the initial sulfur content and the sulfur remaining after calcination under various conditions. The literature data are not always clear enough, but it appears certain that this approach was used in experiments designed to study the effect of sulfur content on the surface prop- erties of the catalysts [19,20,24,25]. No evaluation of catalytic properties was conducted in those studies [ 19,20,24,25]. It is possible that the same impregnation technique was applied in depositing ammonium sulfate on metal oxides, but the description of experiments is somewhat cryptic [ 15,16] 1 We decided to devise an impregnation technique which uses a precise amount of sulfuric acid and compare it with the standard technique in the preparation of sulfated zirconia, which has been reported to be the most active of the monometallic sulfated metal oxides [5,7]. We prepared sulfated catalysts by both methods from ZrO2, as well as from Zr(OH)4, using in each case the same batch of precursor for the new and for the standard method. We calcined each pair of catalysts for the same length of time and at the same temperature. To characterize the catalysts, we determined the sulfur content and the specific surface area. We did not engage in Hammett acidity measurements on these materials because we have concluded on theoretical grounds that this method is not applicable to solid acids (the solids are non-Hammett acids) and that the Ho values deduced for solids do not reflect their actual acidity [35,36]. Instead, we checked whether the materials prepared were active in the isomerization of a saturated hydrocarbon, which is the most demanding test of catalytic activity for carbocationic reactions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst The precursor Zr (OH) 4 was prepared by simultaneous addition of a ZrO (NO3) 2 solution and of concentrated ammonia to water in a vigorously stirred beaker, at a A process for etherification of phenol with methanol used sulfated alumina prepared from sulfuric acid and y-alumina by this method, but the goal of that work was to achieve high selectivity in the competition with ring methylation, rather than high activity [34]. l O0 D. Fdrca~iu, J.Q. Li ~Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 9~105 flow ratio such that pH stayed at 7 + 0.5 [30]. ZrO2 was obtained by calcination of Zr(OH)4 at 500 for 4 h. The sulfated catalysts were prepared from either pre- cursor by the following procedures: Standard procedure The solid was soaked with a large excess of 1 N sulfuric acid solution ( 15 ml per g of solid) for 2 h, filtered with suction through a fritted glass filter, and dried at 150 overnight. The catalyst precursor made from ZrO2 was calcined at 550 for 4 h. (In a preliminary experiment, we observed that calcination at 650 gave poorer catalysts and calcination at 750 gave almost inactive material.) For the catalyst prepared by impregnation of Zr(OH)4 we found that calcination at 580 for 5 h, rather than at 550 for 4 h, gave higher activity, therefore we used the latter calcination procedure. Modified procedure (controlled impregnation) A sample of precursor from the same batch used in each of the preparations described under the standard procedure above was covered with an H2SO4 solution containing the amount of acid intended to be adsorbed, making sure that all the solid was covered. A 0.5 M acid solution was used in all cases; this concentration had been used in the majority of literature reports on sulfated zirconia [5,7,11,17,28-30,37-42]. Having measured first the quantity of sulfur present in the catalyst prepared by the standard procedure, we prepared two catalysts such that the amounts of sulfate which they contained bracketed the content of sulfate in the 'standard'. After two hours at room temperature, each mixture was placed in an oven and dried at 150 overnight, then each solid was calcined under the same conditions as the sample prepared from the same precursor but by the standard technique (percolation). The sulfur content of the catalysts was measured with a sulfur analyzer, model SC-132 from LECO Corporation, by combustion in oxygen at 1097 and deter- mination of SO2 by the intensity of one of its infrared absorption bands. The method and apparatus were tested on the following standards: FeSO4.7H20 (11.51% S); A1KSOa-12H20 (13.5% S); Zr(SO4)z'4H20 (18.03% S); Fe2(SO4)3'5H20 (19.59% S); NazSO4 anb. (22.53% S); and MgSO4 anh. (26.66% S). For good results it was necessary to dilute the samples with silicagel to give a sulfur content lower than 10%. A number of 23 analyses were run on these standards. Three of them were off by more than the 0.4% normally acceptable for elemental analysis (namely by 0.47, 0.51, and 0.55%). For the rest the standard deviation was 0.18. For the analysis of unknown samples, the instrument was checked each time with the analysis of a 1.99 + 0.06% S coal standard. A difference of 0.1 was considered acceptable but the measured spread of results was usually smaller. The surface area was determined with the BET method, by adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K, in an ORR surface-area pore-volume analyzer model 2100 from Micro- metrics Corporation. Prior to the adsorption measurements all the samples were D. Fiirca~iu, J.Q. Li /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 97-105 101 degassed at 200 for 16 h. The adsorption isotherms were determined in a pressure range P/Po = 0.05 to 0.3. All catalysts were stored in glass vials under air and activated before use. 2.2. Isomerization The isomerization of methylcyclopentane was conducted in 5 mm I.D. glass tubes. The desired amount of catalyst (0.09 to 0.12 g) was introduced into a tube and the tube was heated at 450 in air for 2 h to activate the catalyst. As soon as the tube had cooled enough to be handled, it was capped with a rubber septum. When the catalyst and glass tube reached room temperature, the desired amount of methylcyclopentane (reagent grade, used as purchased) was injected into the tube with a syringe and the tube was weighed again. Each glass tube was gently shaken so that the catalyst and methylcyclopentane were well mixed, then the tubes were placed in a thermostated oil bath. Thus, all isomerization experiments were run under air. Samples were taken at intervals and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatog- raphy. An attempt to run the reaction in a vial or flask with magnetic stirring led to a significantly lower level of conversion. The same result was obtained when the reaction was run with stirring in a tube as described above, but with the bottom slightly enlarged and flattened to accommodate a small stirring bar. This highly adverse effect of stirring on catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia had been observed before [43 ]. 3. Results and discussion The properties of the catalysts prepared are given in Table 1. It is immediately seen that the materials prepared by impregnation of Zr(OH)4 have a greater surface area and a higher content of sulfate (measured as percentage of S) than the materials prepared from ZrO2. Sulfation, obviously, reduces the extent of surface area loss upon calcination. Even though we did not investigate the matter, we noticed that the sulfate loading of the material we obtained by the standard procedure from Zr(OH)4 (SZPH1, Table 1 ) did not reproduce any of the literature results (Table 1, footnote f) [ 21,23 ]. This lack of reproducibility might be a consequence of imprecision in the literature procedure or of the incomplete description of the procedure in the pub- lished reports. On the other hand, our results show that the controlled impregnation method allows preparation of catalysts with variable sulfur content without resort- ing to the change of calcination temperature. Instead, the amount of sulfur is varied by changing the amount of acid adsorbed onto the surface. The reproducibility of our method of preparation can be assessed from the observation that five batches of catalyst SZCH2 (0.95 ml of sulfuric acid per gram of Zr(OH)4 each had sulfur 102 D.

Not all the sulfur (sulfate) adsorbed is retained after calcination. As seen in Table 1, this loss of sulfur upon calcination occurs for the catalyst prepared either by percolation or by controlled impregnation. The greater success of the latter method to prepare catalysts with relatively high sulfur content might arise because percolation does not saturate the surface of Zr( OH)4 with acid, whereas controlled impregnation does. Otherwise, the extra acid added in the controlled impregnation technique might be lost upon calcination. A chemical reaction occurs, however, between the acid and the surface during calcination, which produces both an increase in surface area and an increase in sulfur content of the final catalyst. Inspection of Table 1 reveals a correlation between the S content after calcination and the BET surface area of the calcined catalyst. The equivalents of S per unit surface area for each catalyst also increases with sulfur loading. A comparison of the surface areas of SZPH1 with those of SZCH3 and SZCH4, which bracket the sulfur content of the former indicates that the controlled impreg- nation technique gave a material of slightly higher surface area than the percolation technique. A level of sulfate loading significantly higher than obtained using the percolation technique upon exposure to a similar amount of HzSO4 per gram can be obtained by the controlled impregnation technique from ZrO2 as well, as demonstrated by the examples shown in Table 2.

The crystallinity of materials was tested by X-ray diffraction for two samples, SZCO4 and SZCH2, prepared by our method from ZrO2 and Zr (OH)4, respectively (both impregnated with 0.95 ml 0.5 M H2SO4/g). The former was a mixture of tetragonal (T) and monoclinic (M) forms, whereas the latter was entirely tetrag- onal. The retardation of the T-M transition was in line with previous reports [ 17,39,44,45]. To examine the catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia samples we used the isom- erization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane as a test reaction. Methylcyclo- pentane has a volatility convenient both for the study of the reaction and for analysis by GLC, and also it does not undergo cracking. The only reaction product is cyclohexane (the equilibrium composition at 65 is 25% MCP and 75% cyclo- hexane). The very simple experimental technique which we used (cf. Experimen- tal), allows us to screen quickly a large number of samples and to differentiate catalysts of significantly different activity. It is not appropriate, however, for kinetic measurements or fine distinction between catalysts of similar activity. The conditions and results of isomerization experiments conducted with various catalysts are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

There is not much difference, however, between catalytic activity of catalysts prepared from the same precursor by the two methods.

As the sulfur loading controls the surface area, the two parameters are strongly connected. 4. Conclusion Preparation of sulfated zirconia by impregnation of the precursor, ZrOz or Zr(OH)4, with a measured quantity of sulfuric acid followed by evaporation of solvent and calcination represents a more precise and economical procedure than the standard method based on percolation of sulfuric acid through a bed of precursor or impregnation with an excess of acid followed by decantation or filtration. The controlled impregnation procedure gives a material with catalytic activity at least comparable in activity with the materials made by the standard procedure. The amount of sulfur present in the catalyst can be varied by varying the amount of sulfuric acid used for impregnation. The surface area is directly related to the sulfate loading.

The amount of sulfate ion ultimately present in a sulfated zirconia catalyst can be controlled by impregnating the solid with the desired quantity of sulfuric acid in water, evaporating the solvent, and calcining the residue. The surface area is directly related to the amount of sulfur (sulfate) incorporated into the catalyst. Compared to the usual method, consisting of ‘percolation’ of zirconium oxide with sulfuric acid, or immersion of the oxide into a large excess of acid followed by filtration or decanting, the modified procedure leads to a material of similar surface area and of similar catalytic activity for the isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane at 65°C. The controlled impregnation technique allows variation of the sulfur content without a change in the calcination temperature. In addition, no waste sulfuric acid is generated in the modified process.
